1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,400
Who Du du Du Du,
Du Du,

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:04,320
alice

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,150
and Roseanne.
Joe Rogan.

4
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:11,010
We made it happen finally years,
years in the making.

5
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:12,840
Here I am.
I know.

6
00:00:12,841 --> 00:00:15,090
It's one of those things that we talked
about it like 30 times.

7
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,040
I know.
Well thank you so much for having me.

8
00:00:17,041 --> 00:00:18,330
It's my birthday.
No less.

9
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,010
Oh Shit.
Happy Birthday.

10
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,300
Thank you know.
Right?

11
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:22,830
That's right.
Finally,

12
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,810
I have my first drink so much to write
what I've been drinking for years

13
00:00:27,811 --> 00:00:29,750
illegally.
Come on.

14
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,010
We shouldn't admit that.
All of you.

15
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:33,260
For Real,
you'll have to tell you.

16
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,060
Are you one of those people?
No,

17
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,120
I,
I.

18
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,880
It's obscene.
It's obscene how old I've become.

19
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:40,440
How old are you?
Forty one.

20
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,650
Oh,
that's how I'm seen.

21
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:42,900
I'm 40 years.
Really?

22
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:44,010
Yes.
That's obscene.

23
00:00:44,011 --> 00:00:46,920
I'm almost 40 minutes.
I'm almost 50 happy.

24
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:50,790
Almost birthday.
I'll be 50 in a couple months.

25
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:51,990
In a year.
Wow.

26
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:56,100
How do you feel about that?
Sexy as fuck for great.

27
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,110
Feel like you're making almost 50 look
good.

28
00:00:58,111 --> 00:00:59,820
I also feel like there's a hair stuck to
my lip,

29
00:00:59,821 --> 00:01:03,480
so for anyone watching and if there's
like a fuzzball on my face,

30
00:01:03,481 --> 00:01:05,580
I'm sorry.
It's just a 41 year old thing.

31
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,650
I don't think we have a r a.
h,

32
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:10,890
d is not that strong.
I really should've just left it there.

33
00:01:10,891 --> 00:01:15,210
Then whatever it is that the length that
I've collected since arriving deep in

34
00:01:15,211 --> 00:01:16,044
the valley.

35
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:21,190
One thing I do realize though as I get
older is like maintaining health is like

36
00:01:21,501 --> 00:01:25,160
an effort.
You have to be a lot more aware of

37
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:27,930
making sure you eat the right stuff.
Making sure you,

38
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:30,620
you know,
make sure you exercise on a regular

39
00:01:30,621 --> 00:01:32,930
basis.
Don't get attache because you'd get out

40
00:01:32,931 --> 00:01:33,220
of shape.

41
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:36,760
It's again,
it's way harder to get back in right

42
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,550
now.
Did you are such a healthy guy.

43
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:43,660
Did you ever go through a phase when you
were younger of being unhealthy?

44
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,600
Not really,
no.

45
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:49,500
I never went through like a binge
drinking or fat phase.

46
00:01:49,501 --> 00:01:52,500
I mean,
I've gotten overweight slightly before,

47
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,330
but even then I'd look at myself,
I'm like,

48
00:01:54,331 --> 00:01:56,340
you're fucking disgusting.
Slob like,

49
00:01:56,341 --> 00:01:57,660
get it together.
I just,

50
00:01:57,661 --> 00:01:58,660
um,
it's,

51
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,300
you know,
there's,

52
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:04,080
there's two schools of thought on it and
one school of thought is that if you

53
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:08,130
spend too much time on your body that
you're vain and this is a frivolous

54
00:02:08,131 --> 00:02:11,340
pursuit because you're going to die
anyway and it's all pointless,

55
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:16,790
but I feel like that's kind of a cop out
because I think that the only have this

56
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:21,120
one meet vehicle to get you through this
life and if it was a car,

57
00:02:21,121 --> 00:02:23,040
you'd maintain it.
If you have a nice car,

58
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:24,720
what do you do?
You take care of the oil,

59
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:25,540
you know,
you,

60
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,060
you know,
you get it serviced,

61
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:31,740
you deal with all the stuff that makes
it run nice and I think that you've got

62
00:02:31,741 --> 00:02:33,780
to do that with your body.
At least for me,

63
00:02:33,781 --> 00:02:35,970
I have to do that with my body.
If I don't,

64
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:39,750
I don't feel.
And I feel like I'm slacking off in a

65
00:02:39,751 --> 00:02:44,190
way that's lazy and irresponsible and
stupid.

66
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:46,950
I just died.
I just see too many people with health

67
00:02:46,951 --> 00:02:49,380
consequences because they don't take
care of their bodies.

68
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,460
I think it depends.
I think if you're saying it's self

69
00:02:53,461 --> 00:02:57,690
absorbed and it's a vein and it's
shallow to care about your body and if

70
00:02:57,691 --> 00:03:00,340
you're saying that as an excuse to

71
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:05,340
allow yourself to not get into shape,
then I think that you're not really

72
00:03:06,731 --> 00:03:09,220
facing what's going on.
And like that thing where you're like,

73
00:03:09,221 --> 00:03:09,971
oh,
it's just shallow.

74
00:03:09,971 --> 00:03:10,900
That's just,
that's not,

75
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:13,930
you're not really addressing what the
actual resistance is.

76
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,180
I don't know.
I think for me,

77
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,850
um,
I got into a phase where I was going to

78
00:03:18,851 --> 00:03:23,851
a personal trainer and I got really into
it and for the first time all this stuff

79
00:03:23,951 --> 00:03:27,400
that I'd heard my whole life about how
sport,

80
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:30,940
because I'm not a sports person.
So about how sports can affect the rest

81
00:03:30,941 --> 00:03:32,650
of your life.
I never understood that.

82
00:03:32,651 --> 00:03:34,660
I never understood the mental part of
it.

83
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,580
But,
but for that time,

84
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:39,220
and I'm not really in that place
anymore,

85
00:03:39,221 --> 00:03:40,870
but for the time that I was super into
it,

86
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,420
I felt better.
I definitely did.

87
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:48,510
And I felt like I can put in effort in
the gym and it's the effects.

88
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:55,380
Not In terms of what you see on my body.
But how I feel are immediate and uh,

89
00:03:55,841 --> 00:03:59,980
and also that thing of like,
this is a challenge for me,

90
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:04,060
but I'm going to dig deep and I'm going
to do it and I like set these little

91
00:04:04,061 --> 00:04:08,200
goals for myself every day,
almost every day that I could overcome.

92
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:10,110
And that was kind of insane that
feeling,

93
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:13,450
how good I felt when I did something
that I didn't think I could do.

94
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:14,960
And it was happening,
you know,

95
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,023
multiple times a week.

96
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:18,090
I just think it's,
it's almost,

97
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,890
I mean it's not overlooked with a lot of
people,

98
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:22,920
but with some people that is overlooked.
And I think it's unfortunate because

99
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:26,250
it's thought of as like a vain pursuit
or pursuit of vanity.

100
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,590
And it's,
it,

101
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:31,170
it really restructures the way your
brain functions when you,

102
00:04:31,171 --> 00:04:35,910
when you regularly exercise and your
body pumps out all those endorphins and

103
00:04:35,911 --> 00:04:39,150
you release all that stress and your
body sweats.

104
00:04:39,151 --> 00:04:42,720
And it just,
it just feels like it's flowing better.

105
00:04:42,721 --> 00:04:45,930
Like everything's go like your,
your decisions are better.

106
00:04:45,931 --> 00:04:48,480
The way you feel about things is better.
You leave the gym,

107
00:04:48,481 --> 00:04:51,240
you have a smile on your face.
He like driving your car,

108
00:04:51,241 --> 00:04:52,350
the sun feels better,

109
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:53,021
right?
Well,

110
00:04:53,021 --> 00:04:56,710
and that thing where it's like,
I did something healthy for me today.

111
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:00,750
Can I ask a question about something
that you said earlier that actually kind

112
00:05:00,751 --> 00:05:03,460
of ties into all of this?
You said that when the times of your

113
00:05:03,461 --> 00:05:05,170
life where you would get a tiny bit
overweight,

114
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:07,210
you'd look in the mirror and you think
like,

115
00:05:07,211 --> 00:05:08,920
Oh,
you forget exactly what you said,

116
00:05:08,921 --> 00:05:09,191
but like,
oh,

117
00:05:09,191 --> 00:05:11,230
ew,
disgusting fat Slob or something.

118
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:15,040
I've been thinking a lot lately about
the ways that we talk to ourselves

119
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,360
because I can be so,
so brutal on myself.

120
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:22,750
And I've really,
as I've gotten older and I think we've

121
00:05:22,751 --> 00:05:24,550
made it clear,
I'm very old.

122
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:25,773
Um,
I've,

123
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:29,650
I've tried to go more gentle on myself
because it's like I don't speak to

124
00:05:29,651 --> 00:05:33,730
anyone the way I speak to myself,
but I do.

125
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,470
Well,
here's the question.

126
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:40,770
Do you think there's good that comes out
of being really shitty to yourself?

127
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:44,560
The good is the reaction to that.
What you don't like that feeling and

128
00:05:44,561 --> 00:05:47,110
then you do something different.
Because I think if you just look at

129
00:05:47,111 --> 00:05:49,170
yourself and look in the mirror,
go also

130
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:51,260
you

131
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:54,850
tuck your gut into your shirt and Tuck
your shirt into your pants and you just

132
00:05:54,851 --> 00:05:56,710
go about your day and then have a heart
attack.

133
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,220
Didn't.
I don't think you're going to get the

134
00:05:58,221 --> 00:05:59,970
results that you really want.
I think if you.

135
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:04,970
If you want your body to work well,
you have to be honest and if you have

136
00:06:04,971 --> 00:06:08,720
slacked off and you have gained weight
or you have eaten a bunch of shitty food

137
00:06:08,721 --> 00:06:13,721
and you feel like really just slow and
sludgy and you know that feeling that

138
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:18,500
you get if you just indulge too much or
drink too much that oh that just that

139
00:06:18,501 --> 00:06:22,340
the drinking too much of a bad one.
Like last time we did that podcast here

140
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:25,910
with Stan hope I fucking tried to brush
my teeth with deodorant,

141
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,460
deodorant out,
and I had my toothbrush.

142
00:06:28,461 --> 00:06:29,780
I'm like,
what the fuck am I doing?

143
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:33,500
Like my brain was so scrambled from just
getting hammered.

144
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,010
Like that's just a bad feeling.
It's fun while you're doing it.

145
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,540
I believe there's an expression,
I forgot.

146
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:40,670
Who Was it?
Oscar Wilde,

147
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:42,500
uh,
all things in moderation.

148
00:06:42,501 --> 00:06:43,940
Including moderation.
Yes.

149
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:47,060
I think it's a great expression.
I think you got to enjoy your life,

150
00:06:47,061 --> 00:06:50,970
but man,
that feeling after indulging is where

151
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,180
your body is just wrecked.
It's a terrible feeling.

152
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:57,230
And I think the only way to for me at
least to move past that as we go.

153
00:06:57,231 --> 00:06:59,570
All right,
fuck face no more of that stupid shit.

154
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,100
And then get on

155
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:06,430
the right track.
I would find back when I used to indulge

156
00:07:07,191 --> 00:07:12,191
in everything more the feeling of
indulging in the feeling of I'm doing

157
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:15,680
something that I don't think I'm really
okay with the fact that I'm doing it

158
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,490
made me feel a strange from myself.
And then it's like I want to keep the

159
00:07:19,491 --> 00:07:22,290
party going.
There were so many nights because I

160
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:23,120
don't,
I'm,

161
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,110
I'm,
I don't,

162
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:26,650
I don't indulge in much anymore because
I ate,

163
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,970
was kind of getting out of hand.
And this is many years ago that I'm

164
00:07:28,971 --> 00:07:31,760
talking about because I've been on the
planet a lot of years.

165
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:32,890
Um,
I'll,

166
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:36,410
I'll stop with that.
I'll fucking call yourself.

167
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:39,050
That's a true podcast and like some
people,

168
00:07:39,051 --> 00:07:42,950
my father said no,
I'm not sure when I'll start with it,

169
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:44,980
but I think I'll stop with it.
Um,

170
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:50,090
but you know,
I would be out and it would be 1:30 2:30

171
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:54,140
the time when most people would just go
home and I didn't,

172
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:56,360
I didn't want to go home because I
didn't want to be with myself.

173
00:07:56,361 --> 00:08:00,380
I just wanted to go home with whatever
guy I was talking to in the moment.

174
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,461
MMM.
Okay.

175
00:08:01,461 --> 00:08:04,520
So you just wanted to escape.
Yes,

176
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:06,530
yes.
I wanted to escape and then I wanted to

177
00:08:06,531 --> 00:08:07,550
escape myself.

178
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,180
Wow,
that's interesting.

179
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:12,660
That's a very honest way of looking at
it and I think a lot of people feel like

180
00:08:12,661 --> 00:08:13,630
that,
like the,

181
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:18,210
a lot of what the partying is
distraction from their own problems or

182
00:08:18,211 --> 00:08:22,170
their own.
The goals that they haven't tried to go

183
00:08:22,171 --> 00:08:26,280
after,
those sort of nagging problems in their

184
00:08:26,281 --> 00:08:29,980
life they're not working on totally does
destroy it.

185
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:34,990
The mind works in such a weird way where
you chase after distractions sometimes

186
00:08:35,311 --> 00:08:40,311
with all this vigor,
but you don't do the same with the

187
00:08:40,831 --> 00:08:45,831
actual real issues in your life.
You don't chase after them because it

188
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:48,480
doesn't.
There's no immediate gratification in

189
00:08:48,481 --> 00:08:50,550
doing so.
Yeah,

190
00:08:50,551 --> 00:08:53,280
but there's not.
I mean even the immediate gratification

191
00:08:53,281 --> 00:08:56,040
and chasing after distractions,
it's so obvious

192
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,980
what you're doing,
why you're doing it may not always to

193
00:08:58,981 --> 00:09:00,240
yourself though.
No,

194
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:02,790
I guess not.
It is.

195
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,650
If you're paying attention,
but most times you not.

196
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:10,010
It's weird how many different sorts of
mechanisms the brain has in place to

197
00:09:10,351 --> 00:09:15,351
protect you from all the blind spots,
from discomfort and all the things that

198
00:09:16,771 --> 00:09:18,540
are wrong with your approach.

199
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:20,080
Yeah.
Yeah.

200
00:09:20,081 --> 00:09:24,250
I mean I sort of feel like when that
tells me is this an a self absorbed way

201
00:09:24,251 --> 00:09:26,530
to go through the world.
I kind of feel like the point of being

202
00:09:26,531 --> 00:09:31,531
on this earth,
one of the points is self awareness and

203
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:35,740
to figure out what you're doing and why
you're doing it and to kind of become

204
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:36,820
self actualized.

205
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:41,140
It certainly helps you be more efficient
in what you're doing and also realize

206
00:09:41,141 --> 00:09:42,820
what it is you actually enjoy.
Yeah.

207
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:47,860
I think at the end of the day it's an
experience and it's an experience that

208
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:50,130
restarts every day.
You know,

209
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,640
you go to bed,
it shuts off.

210
00:09:51,641 --> 00:09:53,290
You wake up and you go,
here we go again,

211
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,270
and you assume that this is the same
life and you assume that you're not just

212
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:02,110
waking up in some sort of computer
program that pretends that you have 41

213
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:06,670
years of memories.
You go about your day and if you want to

214
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:10,270
make the most out of it,
you have to be aware of these mistakes

215
00:10:10,271 --> 00:10:14,290
that you keep repeating and sort of just
try to not do that anymore and try to

216
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:15,340
get better.
And you know what I'm going to do?

217
00:10:15,341 --> 00:10:17,440
I'm going to fucking start eating Vegan.
You know what I'm gonna do?

218
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,210
I'm gonna Start taking yoga.
You know what I'm going to do?

219
00:10:19,211 --> 00:10:22,410
I want to start at end.
You look at these things as like a

220
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:26,560
positive sort of directions that you
could get on that maybe will change and

221
00:10:26,561 --> 00:10:29,640
then you like fall off the Vegan wagon
or you follow the yoga wagon,

222
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:33,220
you start drinking again and it's like
this constant cycle with a lot of people

223
00:10:33,221 --> 00:10:34,570
have like,
you know,

224
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,360
going on diets and then fucking up and
you know,

225
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:40,210
eating cake,
starting an exercise program and then

226
00:10:40,211 --> 00:10:42,130
getting fat again.
And it's,

227
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:47,020
I think being self aware helps you to
have moments of reflection and I think

228
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:50,980
meditation is really important too.
That's a big one that a lot of people

229
00:10:50,981 --> 00:10:55,480
don't like to do.
Spend time alone by yourself doing

230
00:10:55,481 --> 00:10:59,710
nothing.
Do Twenty minutes a day to sit down and

231
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:02,560
breathe,
sit down and think and they will help

232
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:05,890
you tremendously it because we're on
momentum all the time.

233
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,750
Yes.
I actually,

234
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:12,780
yesterday I began to feel overwhelmed,
um,

235
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:17,740
just from this a bunch of stuff going on
and in the moment I was just like,

236
00:11:17,741 --> 00:11:22,210
I felt kind of shaky and I'm happy to
say I did not go to the kitchen and try

237
00:11:22,211 --> 00:11:23,710
to find something to eat,
you know,

238
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,810
like sort of my old things that I
would've done.

239
00:11:25,811 --> 00:11:29,110
I just,
I made myself take some deep breaths and

240
00:11:29,111 --> 00:11:31,360
tried to calm down.
I don't know how well it worked,

241
00:11:31,361 --> 00:11:34,420
but at least I felt like that was a
healthy way to deal with it in a moment.

242
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:35,710
I think it definitely worked.
Right,

243
00:11:35,711 --> 00:11:37,420
because you're talking about it.
So that's true.

244
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:39,640
Well,
I'm here today so you made it,

245
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:40,250
but

246
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,350
you know what I mean,
like you,

247
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:42,263
you,
you,

248
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:46,130
you're aware that you wanted to reset
your thinking.

249
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,280
So he spent some time and he took some
deep breaths and you reset your

250
00:11:49,281 --> 00:11:51,800
thinking.
I think that's real important for people

251
00:11:51,801 --> 00:11:53,950
because how many times do you just in

252
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:57,130
a momentous react?
I state this girl,

253
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:58,630
she's so crazy.
Road rage.

254
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:02,350
It was hilarious because she wasn't like
a big girl or a dangerous girl or

255
00:12:02,351 --> 00:12:03,700
anything like that.
When someone cut her off,

256
00:12:03,701 --> 00:12:04,760
she's like,
you motherfucker.

257
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,630
And she would,
she would like gun the gas and get

258
00:12:07,631 --> 00:12:11,350
beside them and swerve in front of them.
She was so crazy.

259
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,480
She's from Chicago,
Chicago people.

260
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:17,560
I'm just kidding.
But she was just like really aggressive

261
00:12:17,561 --> 00:12:19,300
that way and I,
you know,

262
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,470
I had to tell her,
I go,

263
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,320
you can't do that with me in the car go
because we could die like,

264
00:12:23,321 --> 00:12:25,240
this is fucking stupid,
like your,

265
00:12:25,241 --> 00:12:29,200
your butt.
And she was just like so caught up in

266
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:34,420
the momentum of her emotions and this
motherfucker thinks he can cut me off

267
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:38,590
bitch.
Or maybe it was like this thing that she

268
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:43,591
had done like all the time and she'd
never thought about it and addressing it

269
00:12:43,991 --> 00:12:46,000
and calming down breathing.
She was like,

270
00:12:46,001 --> 00:12:47,380
yeah,
I guess I should probably stop doing

271
00:12:47,381 --> 00:12:51,460
that.
But it's this momentum of this pattern

272
00:12:51,461 --> 00:12:55,480
of behavior that's cut so deep.
It's such a groove that you always

273
00:12:55,481 --> 00:12:59,800
comfortably fall into like your
coffee

274
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:02,530
proof coffee in my throat.
Um,

275
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,260
it's like,
it's like written into your operating

276
00:13:05,261 --> 00:13:07,840
software,
there are certain people that are

277
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:12,850
programmed to see the world in a way
where it's like people are trying to

278
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:15,970
screw me over and I'm not going to let
that happen.

279
00:13:15,971 --> 00:13:19,780
And so they'll see it everywhere.
Even where it isn't skews the coffee in

280
00:13:19,781 --> 00:13:23,140
my throat.
I to stop drinking this stuff.

281
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:27,370
We should come up with a better way
maybe that emulsified mct oil.

282
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,380
Maybe that's the move without the
butter.

283
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:30,670
Give it a shot.
Let's next move.

284
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,100
Sorry.
No,

285
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:34,120
that's it.
That's what I'm saying.

286
00:13:34,121 --> 00:13:34,780
Yeah.

287
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,550
Yeah.
I think everybody does that.

288
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:37,670
I think it's,
it's,

289
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:41,350
it's normal and especially if it's,
if you have been fucked over before,

290
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:42,460
then you start thinking,
oh,

291
00:13:42,461 --> 00:13:43,660
it's everywhere,
goddammit.

292
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,680
These fucking people.

293
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:47,200
Yeah.
I'm not going to be blindsided again.

294
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,570
It's when you actually do actually get
fucked over,

295
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,260
like in a business deal or with someone
who's trying to fuck you over,

296
00:13:53,261 --> 00:13:55,810
like financially or something like that.
It's like,

297
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,520
it's very disturbing.
It's like,

298
00:13:57,521 --> 00:13:59,320
oh,
this is a real criminal.

299
00:13:59,321 --> 00:14:01,510
I'm involved with the criminal.
Someone's trying to rob me.

300
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,740
Has that happened to you?
Yeah,

301
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,010
definitely and when it does happen it's
you just realize like,

302
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,150
Whoa,
okay,

303
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:10,180
all right,
well some people this is what they do

304
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,910
and you have to now throw that into the
mix.

305
00:14:12,911 --> 00:14:15,550
Like this is a possibility.
Some people would just kind of try to

306
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,620
steal money from you.
For me,

307
00:14:17,621 --> 00:14:20,500
I would need to go back.
It's still,

308
00:14:20,501 --> 00:14:22,690
it still affected my throat.
Excuse me.

309
00:14:22,691 --> 00:14:24,120
I would need to,
I would,

310
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,280
I would become,
I would begin to think about everything

311
00:14:27,281 --> 00:14:30,850
and I'd be like when was the point at
which this started and I'd have to kind

312
00:14:30,851 --> 00:14:35,851
of reconsider everything and that is my
own obsession with certified.

313
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,640
We were talking before,
the way that I can prevent this

314
00:14:39,641 --> 00:14:43,270
happening in the future is to really
understand how this happened now,

315
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:48,930
but I think I get a little too.
I mean I can really like I can,

316
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:51,230
I can ruminate on something too much.

317
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:53,730
Yeah,
I think we all can,

318
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,710
you know,
I think also if something's important to

319
00:14:55,711 --> 00:14:57,480
you and you,
you know,

320
00:14:57,481 --> 00:14:59,740
you really,
you want something to work out well,

321
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:03,480
whether it's a podcast you're doing or
comedy show or something like that,

322
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:06,540
you're getting,
you can kind of obsess on things too

323
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:09,690
much.
You can get so involved in the details

324
00:15:09,691 --> 00:15:10,650
that you kind of,
you know,

325
00:15:10,651 --> 00:15:12,930
the old expression,
you can't see the forest for the trees.

326
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,730
But like what we were saying earlier
about the or I was saying about trying

327
00:15:17,731 --> 00:15:20,180
to talk to myself differently.
This um,

328
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:23,430
this might map barf because it's so,
it's so hippy dippy,

329
00:15:23,431 --> 00:15:26,310
new age like stuart smalley almost.
But

330
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:32,870
lately I've been thinking like is that a
loving behavior towards myself that I'm

331
00:15:33,001 --> 00:15:36,480
engaging in?
So if I'm ruminating about something,

332
00:15:36,481 --> 00:15:38,700
are obsessing about something or
thinking about something that's

333
00:15:38,701 --> 00:15:41,280
upsetting me.
Like is that am I being loving towards

334
00:15:41,281 --> 00:15:45,090
myself?
And then in thinking that way after I

335
00:15:45,091 --> 00:15:46,820
finished vomiting,
I think it like,

336
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:49,110
it allow,
it allows me to actually kind of move

337
00:15:49,111 --> 00:15:50,940
on.
I like put those thoughts down,

338
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:54,990
which is a pretty new thing for me
because I have been at the mercy of my

339
00:15:54,991 --> 00:15:56,220
thoughts always.

340
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:02,200
Well for me,
I think I try to avoid a lot of negative

341
00:16:02,511 --> 00:16:06,560
behavior and negative thinking because
if I allow it,

342
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,110
um,
and I,

343
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,580
I always think of myself as like,
okay,

344
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,370
if I was giving myself advice,
how would I,

345
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,650
how would I treat it?
What would I,

346
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:19,460
I'd probably be pretty brutally honest.
So negative thinking and negative

347
00:16:19,461 --> 00:16:21,650
behavior.
I try to avoid it almost for the

348
00:16:21,651 --> 00:16:24,440
consequences of me,
the chastising myself.

349
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:26,630
Like I don't want to chastise myself.
I like,

350
00:16:26,631 --> 00:16:29,120
I want to like me,
so if I'm fucking up,

351
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:31,010
like I don't want to hear me going,
come on Pussy,

352
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,320
get it together.
So there's,

353
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:36,740
there's that part of me like it's almost
like a drill instructor is like looking

354
00:16:36,741 --> 00:16:39,980
over my shoulder,
making sure that I don't fuck

355
00:16:39,981 --> 00:16:41,510
[inaudible] like bitch,
I'm right here.

356
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,920
Like,
I know what you're doing is stupid,

357
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:43,731
you know,
don't,

358
00:16:43,731 --> 00:16:45,200
don't do,
don't get dumb.

359
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:50,500
And I've been dumb and I think we have
all been dumb and I just think all that

360
00:16:50,811 --> 00:16:54,980
self love and self help is great,
but not if it allows you to continue the

361
00:16:54,981 --> 00:16:57,080
same patterns over and over again and
still love yourself.

362
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,720
That's yes.
That's where you have to really be

363
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:04,500
honest and make sure that your rig
rigorously honest with yourself,

364
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:07,560
you can still love yourself and tell
yourself you're a fat fuck.

365
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,820
Sometimes that's the most loving thing.
Gently,

366
00:17:11,821 --> 00:17:14,130
lovingly.
Tell myself I'm a fat.

367
00:17:14,131 --> 00:17:17,220
Fuck you say it was a giant,
sweet smile.

368
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:19,080
That's the loving part.

369
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:20,400
Yeah,
well it's,

370
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,233
it's,
you know,

371
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,060
it's not bad to be honest.
You know,

372
00:17:23,061 --> 00:17:25,730
and you still love yourself.
Even if you've been eating cake all day,

373
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:26,571
like,
look,

374
00:17:26,571 --> 00:17:28,180
I love you,
but you're gonna fucking die of an

375
00:17:28,181 --> 00:17:29,090
insulin crash here.

376
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,250
See,
that's where.

377
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:32,830
That's where it's like,
is it loving it,

378
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:36,520
man,
I'm really married to this barfy idea.

379
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:39,300
Is it loving to eat cake all day?
No,

380
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,290
that's not.
You're not treating yourself right.

381
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:42,700
If you're doing that,
you know the real

382
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,670
problem is that mouth pleasure is not
even that good.

383
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:49,620
Like the mouth pleasure that you get
from eating cake is the first thinking

384
00:17:49,621 --> 00:17:52,920
about that.
This is like the first bite or the

385
00:17:52,921 --> 00:17:55,610
second bite maybe,
but then when you get deep into it,

386
00:17:55,611 --> 00:17:58,410
it's kind of sickening that yes,
you just keep going.

387
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:03,460
Like my kid had a birthday party the
other day and we eat her cake and I was

388
00:18:04,111 --> 00:18:05,520
like,
Oh fucking Christ.

389
00:18:05,521 --> 00:18:08,670
This stuff is so disgusting.
I have a tiny little bit because I'm

390
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:10,470
like,
you get into it and especially if you

391
00:18:10,471 --> 00:18:13,170
don't need a lot of cake,
like after like the third or fourth

392
00:18:13,171 --> 00:18:13,840
bite,
like,

393
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,510
oh,
like this fucking pasty frosting and

394
00:18:18,511 --> 00:18:19,440
sugar and

395
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:23,020
are you one of those people who pushes
all the frosting to the side and was

396
00:18:23,021 --> 00:18:23,401
like,
oh,

397
00:18:23,401 --> 00:18:24,510
it's too sweet.
I can't.

398
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,430
I'll just have a bite of the wheat germ.
No,

399
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:29,670
I go for the frost at first.
Everybody does.

400
00:18:29,671 --> 00:18:32,130
That's where the love is.
Although that's true.

401
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:35,490
I gave up carbs for about a year.
All carbs,

402
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:36,751
all carbs.
Like,

403
00:18:36,751 --> 00:18:39,660
I was very strict about it,
I was looking at even,

404
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:44,580
I was trying not to Overdo,
I was kind of kind of trying to do like

405
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:45,870
strict,
strict Atkins.

406
00:18:45,871 --> 00:18:49,140
So eventually I allowed more vegetables
in.

407
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,230
But at the beginning I was trying not to
go overboard with that.

408
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,620
And um,
what was your,

409
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:58,980
what was your response to that?
Your body's response at the beginning?

410
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:01,390
So my story is,
um,

411
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:06,500
I was pretty overweight.
I'm growing up and into my twenties and

412
00:19:07,441 --> 00:19:09,900
then,
I mean I kinda gone up and down and then

413
00:19:09,901 --> 00:19:12,720
I finally lost the bulk of it and I've
kept it off for years,

414
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:17,340
but about a year ago it started creeping
back on a little bit because I'm doing

415
00:19:17,341 --> 00:19:18,840
ivf,
I'm trying to get pregnant and I'm

416
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:20,700
shooting myself with hormones all the
time.

417
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:23,580
Um,
and all the things in the past,

418
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:28,680
all the ways in the past that I'd kept
the weight off because it had been about

419
00:19:28,681 --> 00:19:32,460
10 years of really being careful with my
calories and exercising and all that.

420
00:19:32,461 --> 00:19:36,150
Like it just wasn't working anymore and
it was freaking me the fuck out.

421
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:41,600
So that's when I started going to a
personal trainer and that's when I,

422
00:19:43,801 --> 00:19:45,870
um,
and it was not his advice.

423
00:19:45,871 --> 00:19:47,280
I don't know what made me decide to do
it.

424
00:19:47,281 --> 00:19:48,960
I was like,
maybe if I just cut out all carbs,

425
00:19:48,961 --> 00:19:51,000
that'll help.
So at the beginning I did lose weight,

426
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,990
um,
but then it no longer helped in terms of

427
00:19:55,991 --> 00:19:56,440
the,
like,

428
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,010
not then at a certain point I realized,
Oh,

429
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:03,060
the weight comes on at a certain point
in the ivf cycle and then comes back off

430
00:20:03,061 --> 00:20:06,450
in between cycles and goes back and I
realized that I had been freaking out.

431
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:09,720
But it's just,
it's just cycling on its own for people

432
00:20:09,721 --> 00:20:11,910
that are freaking out right now in vitro
fertilization,

433
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:17,470
in vitro fertilization is where,
uh,

434
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:22,200
they fertilize your eggs outside of your
body.

435
00:20:22,201 --> 00:20:25,020
It acts in vitro is in glass,
is what it means,

436
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,710
and it's a way that people who can't get
pregnant naturally can get pregnant.

437
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:34,090
I'm so in,
it involves injecting a lot of hormones

438
00:20:34,621 --> 00:20:36,600
and it's a whole,
it's a whole thing.

439
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:39,090
Uh,
so anyway,

440
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,210
it was affecting my weight.
I believe that now that is what was

441
00:20:42,211 --> 00:20:44,370
affected my weight,
but I was freaking out at the time.

442
00:20:44,371 --> 00:20:47,950
So initially there was some weight loss
and then that stopped,

443
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,640
but I found for a while I enjoyed living
within very strict guidelines.

444
00:20:57,521 --> 00:21:01,240
It was just easier when we go to a
restaurant because I used to joke that I

445
00:21:01,241 --> 00:21:04,480
would like to be buried in a bread
basket with a fuck ton of butter.

446
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,550
Bread and butter is my thing.
Um,

447
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,290
and when we go to a restaurant and they
bring the bread,

448
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:12,490
like I just,
I don't even touch it.

449
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:13,470
It's not mine.
I just,

450
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,630
it was so,
it was nice to not even have to think

451
00:21:16,631 --> 00:21:18,670
about all these things.
Um,

452
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:21,220
but then,
I don't know,

453
00:21:21,221 --> 00:21:24,880
a few months ago I just thought,
I don't feel like this is really doing

454
00:21:24,881 --> 00:21:28,780
anything for me anymore.
And I miss my lean cuisine dinners,

455
00:21:28,781 --> 00:21:31,150
which is what I used to eat.
Cuisine.

456
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:36,400
They're not,
I of all the things you can miss.

457
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:39,470
Well,
healthy choice dinners as well with the,

458
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,350
with that process.
Bullshit.

459
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:45,230
I know I had stopped eating the process,
which I missed.

460
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:49,790
I missed the bullshit I missed.
I missed the wood pulp.

461
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:53,240
Wood wood is wood pulp.
It's probably some kind of filler in

462
00:21:53,241 --> 00:21:55,520
there.
I'm just saying like wood pulp in your

463
00:21:55,521 --> 00:21:57,590
food.
In parmesan cheese.

464
00:21:57,591 --> 00:22:00,310
I think that come out recently.
What?

465
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:02,690
Right.
Jamie knows Jamie.

466
00:22:02,691 --> 00:22:03,560
What are you talking about?
What?

467
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,100
What?
What?

468
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,770
What kind of Parmesan cheese and just
the,

469
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:09,320
you know the bottle of kraft.
Parmesan cheese.

470
00:22:09,321 --> 00:22:12,220
It came out that a certain percentage of
it is like wood shavings or something.

471
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:17,000
Jesus Christ.
Why are they putting in your cheese so

472
00:22:17,001 --> 00:22:21,450
that there's a bigger plants though,
right?

473
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:23,840
Cheese.
You sprinkle what?

474
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:26,330
Cellulose.
Okay.

475
00:22:26,331 --> 00:22:28,000
Hotly contested,
but perhaps not for reasons.

476
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:30,680
My think FDA investigation found that a
Pennsylvania company,

477
00:22:30,681 --> 00:22:32,750
castle cheese incorporated had doctored.

478
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:37,190
It's so called Parmesan with a mix of
cheap cheddar cheese and cellulose.

479
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,870
Also known as wood pulp.
Oh,

480
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,880
well you say cellulose.
That doesn't sound like cellulose.

481
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:46,820
Just sounds like like fiber from plants.
Plant material.

482
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:50,000
Well,
there shouldn't be plant material and

483
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:51,050
fucking cheese.
You

484
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:56,180
asshole should go to jail for that.
Putting fucking wouldn't cheese.

485
00:22:56,181 --> 00:22:59,870
You can't just do that and you can't mix
cheddar cheese with wood and call it

486
00:22:59,871 --> 00:23:04,730
Parmesan so it should have its own new
variety,

487
00:23:04,731 --> 00:23:06,050
name wood,
pulp,

488
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,210
cheesy thing.
Just call it that.

489
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,840
People would buy it.
My mouth is watering.

490
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:13,810
Well,
you're eating lean cuisine insane.

491
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:18,500
I don't know what it is in the processed
frozen dinners that I like,

492
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:21,170
but that's what I like.
Sort of like when I smoked I was like,

493
00:23:21,171 --> 00:23:22,880
yeah,
I think it's the fiberglass in the

494
00:23:22,881 --> 00:23:25,220
cigarettes that I like.
When my wife was pregnant,

495
00:23:25,221 --> 00:23:29,390
she liked Tony knows pizza rolls,
you know those little fucking disgusting

496
00:23:29,391 --> 00:23:30,710
things.
I've not had them,

497
00:23:30,711 --> 00:23:32,270
but I've seen them in the freezer
section.

498
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:34,840
I was buying them for him.
I can't believe you're actually wanting

499
00:23:34,841 --> 00:23:37,640
to eat this shit.
She ate healthy most of the time,

500
00:23:37,641 --> 00:23:41,540
but like she would just one of like vege
out and sit there holding onto her beach

501
00:23:41,541 --> 00:23:45,830
ball stomach.
Tony knows pizza rolls now.

502
00:23:45,831 --> 00:23:46,220
How

503
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:50,810
are you toward your wife and your kids
in terms of beat them up?

504
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:55,930
Do whatever the fuck I want to know how
my diet.

505
00:23:56,690 --> 00:24:01,520
Yeah,
and in terms of being rigorously honest

506
00:24:01,521 --> 00:24:04,260
or letting them kind of come to their
own conclusions,

507
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:08,660
I
don't need to do that with my wife.

508
00:24:08,661 --> 00:24:10,440
She's on the ball,
know she,

509
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:14,210
she's pretty healthy too,
but she also likes to indulge but she's

510
00:24:14,211 --> 00:24:15,350
not,
she's pretty,

511
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:20,710
pretty balanced in terms of like how she
approaches diet and exercise and healthy

512
00:24:21,561 --> 00:24:24,530
eating and then occasionally indulging.
She's balanced.

513
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:27,590
Luckily that's not an issue and for my
kids,

514
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,990
you know,
with kids the big struggle is trying to

515
00:24:29,991 --> 00:24:33,440
keep them from eating too much sugar.
Like I don't want to be that guy that

516
00:24:33,441 --> 00:24:35,870
says you can't have sugar.
Like she has some kids in her class.

517
00:24:35,871 --> 00:24:37,550
One of my daughters does,
um,

518
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,550
this is one kid in particular that's on
this insane diet.

519
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:44,390
Like he doesn't eat any sugar,
there's nothing processed and the kid's

520
00:24:44,391 --> 00:24:47,180
freaking out all the time because all
around them kids are eating cake and

521
00:24:47,181 --> 00:24:52,181
having all these things and I feel like
that can set you up psychologically so

522
00:24:52,911 --> 00:24:55,160
in,
in a bad way where you develop this,

523
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:58,000
where you want to bench later or.
Um,

524
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,720
yeah,
I think uh,

525
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,330
when your parents tell you not to eat,
you want to eat,

526
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,040
you know,
when you tell parents telling you not to

527
00:25:04,041 --> 00:25:05,660
be a slut,
it's the first thing you want to do,

528
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:06,950
right?
It's what everybody does,

529
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:07,910
you know,
don't drink.

530
00:25:07,911 --> 00:25:09,050
I can't wait to drink,
you know,

531
00:25:09,051 --> 00:25:11,060
the,
the suppression is just not good for

532
00:25:11,061 --> 00:25:14,360
human beings.
And so what I try to tell them is you

533
00:25:14,361 --> 00:25:17,960
can have a little sugar but you have to
be aware that sugar is just not good for

534
00:25:17,961 --> 00:25:18,350
your body.

535
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,150
It tastes good,
but it has consequences.

536
00:25:20,151 --> 00:25:23,330
So like when we'd go halloween trick or
treating,

537
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:25,190
you know,
we'd let them have a couple of pieces of

538
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:26,250
candy,
you know,

539
00:25:26,251 --> 00:25:28,850
like you can have a couple of weeks,
you just can't sit and eat that shit

540
00:25:28,851 --> 00:25:30,920
until you go into a coma.
It's not good for you.

541
00:25:30,921 --> 00:25:34,180
So sometimes they repeat it like I don't
like when I eat too much sugar and it

542
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,520
just makes me feel terrible.
But then sometimes like my youngest

543
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:40,220
fucking crazy,
my youngest is a little like a little

544
00:25:40,221 --> 00:25:43,670
barbarian.
She'll eat sugar and then run around the

545
00:25:43,671 --> 00:25:45,850
house.
Rory wrote like,

546
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:48,590
she just stormed the beaches,
she throws her arms back.

547
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,790
It shows you like run around the house,
like sugar it up.

548
00:25:52,791 --> 00:25:53,870
I'm like,
this is insane.

549
00:25:53,871 --> 00:25:55,520
We just gave her a rocket fuel or
something.

550
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,980
Because you think about like a little
tiny body,

551
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:58,610
right?

552
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:01,970
My youngest is five,
almost six and she's,

553
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:04,700
I don't know what she weighs.
Probably less than 50 pounds,

554
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:09,200
so if you give her a fucking candy bar,
like how much sugar's a God damn candy

555
00:26:09,201 --> 00:26:12,590
bar and it's going in that tiny little
body and she just reacts to it.

556
00:26:12,591 --> 00:26:13,424
She's like,
oh,

557
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:16,490
like she'll just chase me,
she'll kick me.

558
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:19,340
She fucking tries to tackle me.
She just goes nuts.

559
00:26:19,341 --> 00:26:20,970
She's like really,
really physical.

560
00:26:20,971 --> 00:26:24,620
When and when she's like sugared up,
it's like super obvious.

561
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,180
I'm like that.
I mean,

562
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:29,130
as long as she's burning it off,
I feel like let her just run around so

563
00:26:29,131 --> 00:26:33,050
she gets crazy and burn it off,
but it's like her five hour energy with

564
00:26:33,051 --> 00:26:36,530
worse doesn't really last five hours.
Last about 40 minutes.

565
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:38,810
And then there's a crash.
Like,

566
00:26:38,811 --> 00:26:42,020
Daddy,
I don't feel tired.

567
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:43,010
I just want to lie.

568
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:47,910
It's hilarious because you know,
they don't,

569
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:50,580
they don't have any experience in life,
you know,

570
00:26:50,581 --> 00:26:53,370
so when they taste the sugar it tastes
good.

571
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:55,380
They eat it,
they have this feeling like,

572
00:26:55,381 --> 00:26:55,950
you know,
like,

573
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:57,630
oh,
I have a sugar rush coming on right now.

574
00:26:57,631 --> 00:26:58,790
Nope.
They don't think like that.

575
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,120
They just go.
I knew,

576
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,410
but you know,
I'm not 100 percent strict but I do make

577
00:27:07,411 --> 00:27:09,780
them eat vegetables.
That's the one thing I do.

578
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:13,380
I make them eat vegetables and I try to
keep them away from shitty food and I

579
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:17,100
try just try to explain why it's good.
Like this is why daddy likes to eat

580
00:27:17,101 --> 00:27:18,630
this.
Like they always mock me that I don't

581
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,570
eat bread and you know,
they like to stick things in front of my

582
00:27:21,571 --> 00:27:25,980
face that they eat and I don't eat.
But most of the time I don't suppress

583
00:27:25,981 --> 00:27:26,260
them.

584
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:29,490
I try to just keep it like even when
they do something wrong,

585
00:27:29,491 --> 00:27:34,110
one of the first things that I say is I
did way worse than you.

586
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:35,190
Like if,
if you,

587
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:36,910
if they did something wrong.
I said ice,

588
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:38,730
do that all the time.
When I was your age,

589
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:40,590
a matter of fact,
I think you're smarter than me,

590
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,320
like you're better at than me and I
always do that.

591
00:27:43,321 --> 00:27:46,410
I always reinforce that.
Every mistake you've made,

592
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,690
I've made everything you've done.
I've done.

593
00:27:48,691 --> 00:27:49,860
If you lied,
I've lied.

594
00:27:49,861 --> 00:27:51,310
Like if I catch him lying about
something,

595
00:27:51,311 --> 00:27:52,260
not telling the truth,
I just say,

596
00:27:52,261 --> 00:27:54,030
look,
I just want to tell you when I was

597
00:27:54,031 --> 00:27:56,460
little,
I lied all the time and I didn't want to

598
00:27:56,461 --> 00:27:57,960
lie,
but I didn't want to get in trouble.

599
00:27:58,230 --> 00:27:59,670
And so I would just lost that.
True.

600
00:27:59,671 --> 00:28:00,570
Or is that a lie though?

601
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:01,800
Um,
I did some lion.

602
00:28:01,801 --> 00:28:02,610
Yeah,
for sure.

603
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:03,780
Yeah,
definitely.

604
00:28:03,781 --> 00:28:05,380
I think every kid has.
Um,

605
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,940
but I was just,
I just wanted to enforce in their head

606
00:28:08,941 --> 00:28:11,610
like this.
You're not going to not love you.

607
00:28:11,611 --> 00:28:12,900
I'm not gonna.
I just.

608
00:28:12,901 --> 00:28:15,060
This is a part of life.
I think that's so great.

609
00:28:15,061 --> 00:28:17,670
That's such a respectful way to raise
your kids.

610
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:21,780
I try to treat them like they're little
human beings that I know more than they

611
00:28:21,781 --> 00:28:24,120
know.
I don't think of him as my kids in that.

612
00:28:24,121 --> 00:28:27,180
Like I own them.
I think of them like they're my kids in

613
00:28:27,181 --> 00:28:30,360
terms of I love them deeply but not like
a,

614
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:32,640
I don't own you like you're a little
human being.

615
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:36,330
And I also think that setting them up
like that gives them a certain amount of

616
00:28:36,331 --> 00:28:39,420
autonomy and a certain amount of
independence that I think is really

617
00:28:39,421 --> 00:28:40,920
critical to develop early on.

618
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,050
So that's not a giant shock when you
turn 18,

619
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:46,530
you know,
slowly build them into this idea.

620
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:50,580
You are a little autonomous human being
then I'm always going to be here.

621
00:28:50,581 --> 00:28:52,860
Like if you need advice,
if you need a hug,

622
00:28:52,861 --> 00:28:53,990
if you need,
you know,

623
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:57,000
you always got a place to sleep.
You don't have to worry like

624
00:28:57,001 --> 00:28:58,350
everything's fine.
Like don't,

625
00:28:58,351 --> 00:29:00,360
don't go through life with fear and
hunger,

626
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:02,100
you know that you don't have to worry
about that.

627
00:29:02,101 --> 00:29:04,710
You have a family,
but you're your own thing.

628
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:07,080
Like what are you into you in the music,
what do you do?

629
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:08,550
You like space,
you know,

630
00:29:08,551 --> 00:29:11,220
when you get into like reading books,
like what's your fucking thing?

631
00:29:11,221 --> 00:29:15,270
Find your thing.
And I never had that chance as a kid,

632
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:20,430
you know,
and I think I'm looking at my life,

633
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:25,520
I'm like back at like the things that
happened to me that made me sort of like

634
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:31,010
rebel and made me sort of reinforced the
idea that I need to be independent.

635
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:34,260
I need to get the fuck away from all
these people need to have stopped all

636
00:29:34,261 --> 00:29:36,840
this negative input coming from all
these different directions.

637
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:42,260
Like I sort of inhabit children,
get a chance to what I would have liked

638
00:29:43,751 --> 00:29:46,750
about my own childhood.
Did you have an oppressive upbringing?

639
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:50,080
Wasn't oppressive?
It just was.

640
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:53,230
There wasn't a lot of attention is like
I just,

641
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:56,380
my parents really just weren't into it,
you know,

642
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,150
this,
I think that there was a lot of latchkey

643
00:29:58,151 --> 00:30:00,900
kids in our generation.
And um,

644
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:05,290
I mean I used to.
I walk out the door when I was seven and

645
00:30:05,291 --> 00:30:06,820
wander through the neighborhood.
I used to do it.

646
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,510
I did a fisherman's wharf magic show
when I was eight years old.

647
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,940
What the fuck?
Let's their eight year old.

648
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:15,550
Like my daughter just turned eight.
One of my daughters did.

649
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,730
And uh,
I couldn't imagine her just walking out

650
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:23,790
my house in San Francisco and wandering
down the street and being by herself

651
00:30:24,071 --> 00:30:25,780
with no one,
I can't imagine that.

652
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,070
And so I,
I would think about like,

653
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:30,440
what my parents let me do and,
you know,

654
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:34,000
made me independent and a lot of ways,
but God put me in so much danger.

655
00:30:34,001 --> 00:30:35,900
There's so many times.
Yeah.

656
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:40,030
I think if you're forced to be an adult
when you're a child,

657
00:30:40,031 --> 00:30:42,560
you pay for it somehow later.
No,

658
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,440
I'm sure.
You sure.

659
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:47,520
I'm sure there's pros and cons,
you know,

660
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:52,530
if you can get through it all,
you have a more comprehensive view of

661
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:56,500
the world and the dangers are provided.
But I mean that was almost molested when

662
00:30:56,501 --> 00:31:00,040
I was like eight by some fucking creep
at a library that I was hanging out at

663
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:02,530
the library and saved me.
I was,

664
00:31:02,531 --> 00:31:05,140
I'm looking through.
I was in the monster movies when I was a

665
00:31:05,141 --> 00:31:06,820
little kid.
I was really into like,

666
00:31:06,821 --> 00:31:11,110
Dracula and Frankenstein and shit.
So I was looking through these books and

667
00:31:11,111 --> 00:31:12,940
this guy came up to me and he was like,
really weird.

668
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:15,250
And um,
he said,

669
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:17,350
you know,
you like a monster books.

670
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,131
And I go,
yeah.

671
00:31:18,131 --> 00:31:18,730
He goes,
ah,

672
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:20,110
I really,
I love monster books.

673
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:23,740
I've got some monster books in my car.
Do you want to see him on my hands?

674
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,060
Exactly.
Something like,

675
00:31:25,061 --> 00:31:26,070
okay,
you know,

676
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,030
I didn't know any better.
And so I started walking with them in

677
00:31:28,031 --> 00:31:31,420
the library and starts yelling at me
because she had seen me there before.

678
00:31:31,421 --> 00:31:33,130
And you know,
she's real nice lady and she's like

679
00:31:33,131 --> 00:31:34,270
yelling,
Joseph,

680
00:31:34,271 --> 00:31:38,710
you get away from that man.
He just got out of prison and the Guy

681
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:42,160
Ran,
he ran and I just started crying.

682
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:45,460
I couldn't believe it.
You know,

683
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,730
I remember thinking at the time like,
who the fuck just lets a little kid just

684
00:31:48,731 --> 00:31:50,950
wander around like,
like they do.

685
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:53,320
So time you thought that?
Yeah.

686
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,390
Yeah,
I remember thinking that at the time.

687
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:56,980
Like,
why the fuck am I just wandering around

688
00:31:56,981 --> 00:31:58,870
here?
Did you tell your parents?

689
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,930
Yeah.
What's fucked up is my mom didn't

690
00:32:01,931 --> 00:32:04,390
remember it.
Like I talked to my mom about it

691
00:32:04,391 --> 00:32:05,560
recently.
She didn't remember.

692
00:32:05,561 --> 00:32:07,180
Mike,
how do you not remember?

693
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:09,460
This guy tried to molest me when I was
eight.

694
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:12,610
He got upset at her.
What was her reaction to see you're

695
00:32:12,611 --> 00:32:15,250
getting upset?
It's just that was that latch key thing

696
00:32:15,251 --> 00:32:15,701
like,
yeah,

697
00:32:15,701 --> 00:32:16,481
you're fine.
Look,

698
00:32:16,481 --> 00:32:17,470
you didn't.
Nothing happened.

699
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:20,290
You know,
it's like they have this attitude.

700
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:22,480
Well,
I think for the longest time that was

701
00:32:22,481 --> 00:32:23,350
the attitude of like,
look,

702
00:32:23,351 --> 00:32:24,760
I can't,
I kept you physically safe.

703
00:32:24,761 --> 00:32:27,160
You're in clothing.
You went to school,

704
00:32:27,161 --> 00:32:28,270
whatever it is,
you know,

705
00:32:28,271 --> 00:32:29,860
so what's the problem?
And it's like,

706
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,770
well,
there's all the whole emotional side of

707
00:32:32,771 --> 00:32:33,900
things.
Well,

708
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:38,940
I think when you look at our generation
versus our parent's generation and their

709
00:32:39,321 --> 00:32:42,830
parents generation,
if you just go back a couple generations

710
00:32:42,831 --> 00:32:45,650
to like my grandparents' days,
my grandparents were immigrants.

711
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,630
They came over on a boat from Italy and
Ireland.

712
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:53,110
And when you think about what their life
was like versus what our life is like

713
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:55,790
today,
I mean we're barely even related.

714
00:32:55,791 --> 00:32:58,790
We're so.
We're so different with our access to

715
00:32:58,791 --> 00:33:00,800
information,
with the understanding that people have

716
00:33:00,801 --> 00:33:03,560
about raising people,
but communicating with people about

717
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,320
talking to yourself.
Even in your reference to going to the

718
00:33:06,321 --> 00:33:08,270
library isn't fantastic.
Yeah.

719
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,650
Yeah,
it is.

720
00:33:09,651 --> 00:33:12,710
Right.
I mean imagine you having that kind of a

721
00:33:12,711 --> 00:33:15,890
conversation with your parents when they
were your age about loving yourself.

722
00:33:15,891 --> 00:33:17,900
Am I being loving myself?
They'd be like,

723
00:33:17,901 --> 00:33:20,240
what the fuck are you talking about?
Go out there and farm.

724
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,770
Even I feel that way towards myself
though.

725
00:33:22,771 --> 00:33:25,660
I guess I'm an old soul so I just.
Okay.

726
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,740
I think you're introspective.
So you're looking at yourself,

727
00:33:28,741 --> 00:33:29,920
you know,
mind might in a dark.

728
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:33,240
Whereas this,
it's more that than anything.

729
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:36,900
Yeah.
So you're trying to get pregnant.

730
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:37,950
So.
Yes,

731
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:40,050
yes.
We actually haven't transferred any of

732
00:33:40,051 --> 00:33:44,040
the embryos.
We've just been collecting them and

733
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:49,100
they're frozen and we are about to start
the first transfer in the next couple

734
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:54,030
weeks.
So you'd make it a Frankenstein baby.

735
00:33:54,031 --> 00:33:55,450
That's right.
Science involved.

736
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:58,710
I know.
I was listening to you and I know you

737
00:33:58,711 --> 00:34:00,480
and Whitney Cummings,
we're talking about that.

738
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:05,840
Um,
and it is crazy and a weird thing is

739
00:34:05,911 --> 00:34:09,390
that you could have like,
let's say,

740
00:34:09,391 --> 00:34:12,900
of all of our embryos,
two of them are good and will create

741
00:34:12,901 --> 00:34:15,420
babies.
If they happen to be implanted at the

742
00:34:15,421 --> 00:34:17,310
same time,
then I will give birth to twins,

743
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,900
but if not that and we go another round,
then I could have kids,

744
00:34:21,901 --> 00:34:24,080
you know,
a couple of years apart and like that's

745
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:26,670
what were you,
have you end up doing all this weird

746
00:34:26,671 --> 00:34:29,460
math of like how many should I implant
to maximize the chance of getting

747
00:34:29,461 --> 00:34:29,880
pregnant?

748
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,270
Minimize the chance of multiples.
Um,

749
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:33,460
I don't know.
It is,

750
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:35,710
it's weird.
They take your egg and they take your

751
00:34:35,711 --> 00:34:38,350
husband's berm and they mix it up in a
lab somewhere.

752
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:40,690
Well,
do they do it with lightning bolts and

753
00:34:40,691 --> 00:34:42,800
shit?
They've raised the table up to the.

754
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:46,870
Yeah,
everything goes dark for a second and

755
00:34:46,871 --> 00:34:49,790
very quiet.
It's,

756
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,420
yeah,
it's exactly like that.

757
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,290
Crazy that they can freeze the embryos.
That's the trickiest one.

758
00:34:56,350 --> 00:35:01,350
And I think normally or I think
traditionally what they do is they take

759
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:06,160
the eggs and then they take the sperm
and they put it together in a petri dish

760
00:35:06,161 --> 00:35:08,080
and then just kind of let it do its
thing.

761
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:12,820
But for certain people they do something
called ECC,

762
00:35:12,821 --> 00:35:14,050
which is,
let's see if I can.

763
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,770
It's interests.
Cyto plasma,

764
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:21,830
my something sperm injection.
So they take the sperm and they

765
00:35:22,961 --> 00:35:26,770
literally inject it and I don't know how
like they must have the tiniest little

766
00:35:26,771 --> 00:35:31,771
needle into the egg.
So it's even more minute.

767
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,650
Yeah.
It's kind of crazy that they can do that

768
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,930
because what if you catch a week load
that way?

769
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,380
Like a week load gets lucky like you,
I would always want the strong

770
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:46,020
just through the egg to get some.
Well I think that they are using

771
00:35:46,071 --> 00:35:47,840
analysis to,
to uh,

772
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:50,570
get rid of the weak ones.
They do sperm analysis.

773
00:35:50,571 --> 00:35:51,950
They do have like a,
Oh my God,

774
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:56,360
that's like the first thing,
like buds camp for sperm in the weak

775
00:35:56,361 --> 00:35:57,560
ones,
they ring the bell,

776
00:35:57,770 --> 00:36:02,060
they take all the sperm they take,
they drive them far into the mountains,

777
00:36:02,061 --> 00:36:04,400
they drop them off,
they give them one peanut and they say,

778
00:36:04,401 --> 00:36:06,500
we'll come back for you in three weeks
and if you're still here,

779
00:36:06,501 --> 00:36:09,090
we're going to inject you into an egg,
give you a Swiss army knife for no

780
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:11,680
fucking piece of shoestring.
Figured out stupid.

781
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:16,980
They take away your shoe laces and they
say you have a lot of thinking to do.

782
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:20,230
Been very bad sperm.
I'm to make a person stupid.

783
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,090
No,
but I get what you're saying in terms of

784
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,590
natural selection.

785
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:31,090
Ivf is circumventing all of that because
it's taking a whole bunch of women who

786
00:36:31,941 --> 00:36:36,941
are past the age that they can get
pregnant naturally and it's allowing

787
00:36:38,001 --> 00:36:39,110
them to get pregnant.
Yeah,

788
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,180
I mean it is in a way,
but if you make an awesome person that

789
00:36:44,181 --> 00:36:45,340
way,
that's the.

790
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:46,251
Well,
I mean,

791
00:36:46,251 --> 00:36:48,830
yeah,
there's also that argument which is,

792
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:50,570
but,
but the people who are doing it are

793
00:36:50,571 --> 00:36:55,571
people who have tried to be responsible
and wait until they're at a point in

794
00:36:55,971 --> 00:37:00,500
life when they can have kids versus like
a 22 or 23 year old who,

795
00:37:00,501 --> 00:37:03,290
and I'm sure there's plenty of great.
Actually I've never met them,

796
00:37:03,291 --> 00:37:05,240
but they're probably out there,
have had kids that young and it all

797
00:37:05,241 --> 00:37:09,290
turned out well.
They can get pregnant pretty easily

798
00:37:09,291 --> 00:37:10,430
usually,
but I don't,

799
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:14,480
I feel like most early people in their
early twenties aren't really ready to

800
00:37:14,481 --> 00:37:19,481
have kids yet and still like we're
getting emotionally ready later,

801
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:21,860
but our biology is staying the same

802
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:24,290
100 percent.
Well that's one of the things that I

803
00:37:24,291 --> 00:37:26,180
always think about when I think about my
mom.

804
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:30,680
Like my mom had me when she was 21 when
she got pregnant when she was 20 and

805
00:37:30,681 --> 00:37:33,170
when she's 21,
she had a baby when I was 21.

806
00:37:33,171 --> 00:37:35,470
I was a fucking moron.
Yeah.

807
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:38,810
I can't imagine being forced to raise a
kid when I was 21.

808
00:37:38,811 --> 00:37:42,830
I was so irresponsible.
I couldn't take care of myself and I

809
00:37:42,831 --> 00:37:46,220
think the,
the natural process of people getting

810
00:37:46,221 --> 00:37:48,860
pregnant really young.
I mean like how strange is it with human

811
00:37:48,861 --> 00:37:51,890
beings that you're essentially able to
get pregnant when you're 13.

812
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:52,870
Right.
That's,

813
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:55,730
that's crazy.
I just crazy fucking crazy.

814
00:37:56,360 --> 00:38:01,360
So my daughter who is just turned eight,
she's got five years.

815
00:38:02,271 --> 00:38:04,430
She pregnant.
That's insane.

816
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:06,530
She's a tiny little thing,
a little person,

817
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:10,190
little baby person,
and like that little baby person can

818
00:38:10,191 --> 00:38:12,770
have a baby inside of them.
That's madness.

819
00:38:12,771 --> 00:38:17,710
It's just our biology is so.
It's so irresponsible now.

820
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,610
It really is.
It really is.

821
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:20,631
Yeah,
it's,

822
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:21,440
it's,
uh,

823
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,840
it's just,
it's just such a weird holdover from a

824
00:38:23,841 --> 00:38:27,590
time that we can't even remember when it
made sense to get pregnant at 13.

825
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,251
Well,
yeah,

826
00:38:28,251 --> 00:38:29,270
we can't remember.
But

827
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,640
that's the weirdest thing about biology,
right,

828
00:38:31,641 --> 00:38:34,580
is that the changes that take place
naturally,

829
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:38,140
they over long periods of time,
hundreds of thousands,

830
00:38:38,141 --> 00:38:41,920
if not millions of years,
but the changes take taking place in our

831
00:38:41,921 --> 00:38:46,300
culture and our society over the last
thousand years has been insane.

832
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:51,880
The massive amount of difference between
living in 1016 versus 2016 is just you

833
00:38:54,911 --> 00:38:57,210
can't even.
It's there.

834
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,770
It's barely the same life.

835
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:05,370
Do you think the amount of change that
we have recently is the same amount of

836
00:39:05,371 --> 00:39:08,040
change that had there has always been
historically though?

837
00:39:08,041 --> 00:39:09,990
Or do you feel like things are like
speeding up?

838
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:11,390
Oh,
they're definitely accelerating.

839
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:13,400
They're accelerating because of
technology.

840
00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:18,470
One hundred percent that it's just the
world we live in today is alien compared

841
00:39:18,471 --> 00:39:21,380
to the world of a thousand years ago or
even a few hundred years ago.

842
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:24,050
If you went 200 years ago and showed
them what people,

843
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,460
how people are living today,
they'd be like,

844
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:29,090
Holy Shit.
Even the crazy science fiction authors,

845
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:34,330
authors of the 18 hundreds who you know
Jules Verne and you know orson wells and

846
00:39:34,581 --> 00:39:38,300
all these crazy people that had all
these great ideas about the future,

847
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:41,930
they never thought the Internet.
The Internet is bizarre.

848
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:45,740
That the idea that it's not going to be
metal spaceships that change us.

849
00:39:45,741 --> 00:39:48,820
It's not going to be laser beams that
were not going to live in the sky,

850
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:52,730
way crazier than that.
We're gonna live in this one spot,

851
00:39:52,731 --> 00:39:56,600
but everything's going to be there for
you wirelessly and we're all going to be

852
00:39:56,601 --> 00:39:59,630
connected in that way globally
wirelessly.

853
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:02,810
That's the most fucked up thing.
When I was sitting at home the other day

854
00:40:02,811 --> 00:40:06,200
and somebody sent me a youtube video and
I was watching this crazy youtube video

855
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,930
and as I'm watching Mike,
how bizarre is that?

856
00:40:08,931 --> 00:40:13,190
Someone just sent me something.
I press it and now here I'm watching it

857
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,420
and it's,
it's,

858
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:19,460
it's playing out in front of me like not
even two seconds after I've got the text

859
00:40:19,461 --> 00:40:20,870
message.
I'm watching this thing.

860
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:21,920
Yeah.
Well,

861
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,800
I,
I was listening to you recently talk

862
00:40:24,801 --> 00:40:29,801
about how you don't think that the human
brain is really like can really knows

863
00:40:30,141 --> 00:40:34,770
how to process celebrity and that's why
we end up putting the Kardashians.

864
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:36,590
Stop me if I'm putting words in your
mouth,

865
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:41,030
but like that's why we end up putting
Kardashians on a pedestal or something

866
00:40:41,031 --> 00:40:46,031
because we are biological or biological
historically wired to follow achievement

867
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:50,330
and success and strength and things like
that,

868
00:40:50,331 --> 00:40:54,010
but then you take people and put them on
TV and turn them into idle,

869
00:40:54,011 --> 00:40:55,400
so to speak,
and it's like that.

870
00:40:55,401 --> 00:40:56,240
Then our,
our,

871
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:58,220
our lizard brain goes,
oh,

872
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:00,110
you're someone who has achieved
something.

873
00:41:00,111 --> 00:41:03,530
I should follow you.
I was kinda thinking by the same token,

874
00:41:03,531 --> 00:41:07,220
I don't think that the human brain knows
how to deal with technology information,

875
00:41:07,221 --> 00:41:09,500
the Internet,
all of that because it's like

876
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:16,930
someone can say something shitty on the
Internet and I don't get that bummed out

877
00:41:16,931 --> 00:41:20,140
by Internet comments anymore,
but there was a time where it's like

878
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,720
some something someone says something
shitty.

879
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:27,250
My brain doesn't know how to regard that
doesn't know how to put that,

880
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:29,890
how to prioritize that,
how to see that in perspective.

881
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:31,180
It just feels like,
oh,

882
00:41:31,181 --> 00:41:33,320
someone close to me.
Is St something Shitty as opposed to

883
00:41:33,321 --> 00:41:34,040
like,
this is

884
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:38,670
one comment in a sea of comments.
Yeah.

885
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,350
Yeah.
And also one person who you ordinarily

886
00:41:42,351 --> 00:41:45,980
wouldn't be in contact with,
you wouldn't want to hang out with them.

887
00:41:45,981 --> 00:41:48,050
You didn't like them,
they decided to start judging you,

888
00:41:48,051 --> 00:41:53,051
but that's also the flip side of it is
what you can do with your podcast is

889
00:41:54,861 --> 00:41:56,600
reached people that you would never
contact,

890
00:41:57,020 --> 00:42:00,470
reach the world and so you're going to
have people reach back.

891
00:42:00,471 --> 00:42:03,260
It's part of what some people like about
it.

892
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:06,590
I the ability to comment on something
and somebody that's not valid at all,

893
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:08,960
like you're going to get criticisms that
are just not valid.

894
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:12,140
They don't make any sense,
but I and I should say like that level

895
00:42:12,141 --> 00:42:17,141
of connection and that interaction is I
think the best part of it and there is

896
00:42:17,361 --> 00:42:19,760
just this sort of dark side that comes
with that of like,

897
00:42:19,761 --> 00:42:21,380
yeah,
you're going to hear some shit you wish

898
00:42:21,381 --> 00:42:22,214
you hadn't heard.

899
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,310
But for the most part it's amazing.
Yeah,

900
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:26,810
for the most part,
it's amazing.

901
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,180
The thing that you were talking about
with the Kardashians,

902
00:42:29,181 --> 00:42:31,220
that was something that Neil degrasse
Tyson,

903
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:34,550
just instagram the other day.
That was a conversation that he and I

904
00:42:34,551 --> 00:42:39,320
had when I did his podcast and I really
firmly believe that,

905
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:42,710
that there's something about pointing a
camera at someone and putting them on a

906
00:42:42,711 --> 00:42:47,630
screen that you look at them and it
hijacks your reward system,

907
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:52,670
the reward system that's designed to say
if there's like some,

908
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:56,240
the,
the mother of this tribe and she's been

909
00:42:56,390 --> 00:43:00,260
alive for a long time and she has all
this wisdom and so when she talks in

910
00:43:00,261 --> 00:43:02,360
front of the fire,
but it's sits down and listens.

911
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:03,570
Why they listened.
Well,

912
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:05,990
because she survived.
She's achieved.

913
00:43:05,991 --> 00:43:09,410
She's someone who you have to pay
attention to because she knows things

914
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:10,640
and you know,
she knows things.

915
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,020
So when she starts talking,
you listen.

916
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:17,510
That can all be hijacked by a fucking
reality TV show camera on Bravo.

917
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:19,040
And next thing you know,
it's real housewives.

918
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:22,970
Some pilled up bitch screaming at her
friend and you know,

919
00:43:22,971 --> 00:43:27,290
like we pay attention to them.
I'm a friend of mine was at the,

920
00:43:27,291 --> 00:43:29,540
um,
one of the people from that real

921
00:43:29,541 --> 00:43:33,200
housewives show has this,
I'm a restaurant.

922
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:35,510
Is it sir?
And does it have to do with vanderpump

923
00:43:35,511 --> 00:43:38,000
rules,
which I've recently become obsessed with

924
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:40,490
that lady.
So fucking nuts at vanderbilt are all

925
00:43:40,491 --> 00:43:42,020
nuts.
They're fucking so crazy.

926
00:43:42,021 --> 00:43:44,180
But anyway,
when my friend was at the restaurant,

927
00:43:44,181 --> 00:43:49,181
she said that that lady walked in and
people started losing their shit is

928
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:50,121
here.
She's here.

929
00:43:50,121 --> 00:43:51,980
She's by why they're at the restaurant.
Yeah.

930
00:43:51,981 --> 00:43:52,610
See here?
Yeah.

931
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:54,350
Oh yeah.
And then they were freaking out.

932
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:55,220
They couldn't believe it.

933
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:57,230
They were getting their phones out there
looking up at her.

934
00:43:57,231 --> 00:44:00,680
I'm like,
this is an incredibly

935
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:04,220
unexceptional person.
I mean,

936
00:44:04,221 --> 00:44:06,470
she's just nothing about it.
She holds her.

937
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:08,960
She talks,
she's got restaurants.

938
00:44:08,961 --> 00:44:10,460
But you know what I'm saying?
Like when you're,

939
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:13,070
when you listening to her talk,
there's nothing that makes you like

940
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:15,230
compelled to listen to her.
There's no,

941
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:19,190
like really fascinating words coming out
of her mouth.

942
00:44:19,191 --> 00:44:22,010
She doesn't have any skill.
She's not an artist.

943
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,660
She's a singer.
She's not.

944
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,040
There's nothing there.
Well,

945
00:44:25,041 --> 00:44:28,760
and then you get to the,
they'll sometimes I sort of get stuck in

946
00:44:28,761 --> 00:44:30,920
this eddy of like,
well,

947
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:32,160
what this

948
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:36,450
person has created is a very watchable
reality show.

949
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,340
Sure.
Like in terms of content,

950
00:44:38,341 --> 00:44:41,430
Kris Jenner,
look at what she's created,

951
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:42,960
but I don't know,
but I don't know.

952
00:44:42,961 --> 00:44:44,040
Is that art?
I,

953
00:44:44,070 --> 00:44:44,810
you know,
I don't know.

954
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:46,520
Well,
we love assholes.

955
00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:50,150
People love watching assholes.
We love people screaming at each other.

956
00:44:50,151 --> 00:44:53,540
We love people sniping at each other.
We love people doing shitty things to

957
00:44:53,541 --> 00:44:56,630
each other.
And we love scenes that last 10 seconds,

958
00:44:56,750 --> 00:44:57,770
10 seconds,
boom.

959
00:44:57,771 --> 00:44:59,390
Cut the next 10 seconds,
boom.

960
00:44:59,391 --> 00:45:00,870
Cut to like,
what's happening now?

961
00:45:00,871 --> 00:45:01,521
Oh,
what's happening now?

962
00:45:01,521 --> 00:45:04,070
Like they know the exact amount of time.
It's almost like they've got an

963
00:45:04,071 --> 00:45:06,560
algorithm like when to change the camera
scene.

964
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:08,480
When or when to change the angle.

965
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:11,050
Have you ever.
I'm going to guess you have not ever

966
00:45:11,051 --> 00:45:12,400
seen vanderpump rules?
No.

967
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:15,010
I have recently become,
like I said,

968
00:45:15,011 --> 00:45:17,390
sort of addicted to it.
Um,

969
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:19,420
and at the beginning my husband would be
like,

970
00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:21,430
so what is going on?
He'd wander in like,

971
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:22,510
what's going on now?
I'm like,

972
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:26,830
I honestly don't even know.
It's like watching the screen saver I

973
00:45:26,831 --> 00:45:31,060
had in college was just fractals.
It's just watching beautiful Tan people

974
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:33,130
yell at each other.
It's mesmerizing.

975
00:45:33,310 --> 00:45:35,620
And it kind of is,
it calms me down,

976
00:45:35,621 --> 00:45:37,630
but I'm not,
I'm not really paying attention.

977
00:45:37,631 --> 00:45:39,340
I'm just observing.

978
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:41,120
Well,
I used to watch the beverly hills

979
00:45:41,121 --> 00:45:44,390
housewife show just to get upset when
you see these pilled up,

980
00:45:44,490 --> 00:45:47,100
ladies yell at each other and then
disappear the bathroom and then they

981
00:45:47,101 --> 00:45:48,620
would go to the bathroom.
She's on pills,

982
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:52,040
bitch at each other and stuff.
And it was,

983
00:45:52,041 --> 00:45:53,090
uh,
it was,

984
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:55,970
it was weird.
Like they would try to hurt each other's

985
00:45:55,971 --> 00:45:58,550
feelings on camera.
It was like so obvious.

986
00:45:58,560 --> 00:45:59,200
Yeah,

987
00:45:59,200 --> 00:45:59,681
I know.
Well,

988
00:45:59,681 --> 00:46:04,310
that's another thing is that like
specifically with what,

989
00:46:04,311 --> 00:46:08,500
with all of those shows,
I can feel the producer slightly off

990
00:46:08,501 --> 00:46:12,760
camera feeding them lines and,
and it's like there's this drama that in

991
00:46:12,761 --> 00:46:14,980
real life wouldn't like really,
is that,

992
00:46:14,981 --> 00:46:17,020
are you,
are you really that upset about that?

993
00:46:17,021 --> 00:46:20,620
Because suddenly six people are upset
about something that seems like not a

994
00:46:20,621 --> 00:46:22,150
big deal.
And I feel like that was,

995
00:46:22,270 --> 00:46:24,850
that existed on paper before they did
those scenes.

996
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,170
Well,
more importantly,

997
00:46:26,171 --> 00:46:28,870
your entertainment has been observing
fools.

998
00:46:28,990 --> 00:46:31,840
Like you've put fools on for half an
hour on television.

999
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:37,320
And that now becomes what focuses,
what were your mind focuses on instead

1000
00:46:37,541 --> 00:46:40,960
of something really truly interesting
and enlightening or something

1001
00:46:40,990 --> 00:46:44,440
entertaining,
or you're watching fools reluctantly

1002
00:46:44,441 --> 00:46:46,870
with this like weird,
guilty feeling like,

1003
00:46:47,110 --> 00:46:48,250
what am I doing?
One more one.

1004
00:46:48,790 --> 00:46:52,270
And then you realize like these are
people that you would never want to hang

1005
00:46:52,271 --> 00:46:55,780
out with in real life and here on this
podcast.

1006
00:46:55,781 --> 00:46:59,230
But I hear what you're saying.
But if what's weird is if that was a

1007
00:46:59,231 --> 00:47:00,880
drama,
it was a drama.

1008
00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:03,160
It was a show and it was all completely
made up.

1009
00:47:03,161 --> 00:47:05,740
It wouldn't be nearly as interesting
because the narratives are really

1010
00:47:05,741 --> 00:47:07,960
boring.
It's like we're going to go get shoes.

1011
00:47:07,961 --> 00:47:10,630
We're going to go down this journey
together and Debbie needs to.

1012
00:47:10,631 --> 00:47:13,240
She doesn't think she needs shoes,
but I'm telling her she needs fucking

1013
00:47:13,241 --> 00:47:13,820
shoes.

1014
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:17,630
Accumulation chosen those shoes.
I would not wear those shoes,

1015
00:47:17,631 --> 00:47:18,810
but I'm not going to tell her that.
And

1016
00:47:18,830 --> 00:47:20,670
there's one girl who just says what's on
her mind.

1017
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:23,950
She people think she's a bitch,
but she just keeps it real.

1018
00:47:24,270 --> 00:47:25,890
She keeps it real.
She speaks her mind.

1019
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:27,060
I'm just gonna.
Keep it real.

1020
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:32,050
Keep it real and know you have these.
She says what everyone else is afraid to

1021
00:47:32,051 --> 00:47:35,710
say except for the six other people who
are also saying that we all think it,

1022
00:47:35,711 --> 00:47:38,560
but we won't say it and she's the one
that says it should go right in your

1023
00:47:38,561 --> 00:47:39,760
face.
She doesn't care.

1024
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:44,890
She doesn't care and Stephanie for you.
But I know a couple of those people in

1025
00:47:44,891 --> 00:47:48,430
real life like from the show,
from real housewives of Beverly Hills

1026
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:52,960
and they're really sad,
really depressed and really sad and the

1027
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:56,830
blowback from being on that show is
atrocious.

1028
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:02,170
Like their social media blowback that
they read the comments and there they

1029
00:48:02,171 --> 00:48:03,100
get devastated.

1030
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:04,600
Like,
do you remember when Kelsey grammer's

1031
00:48:04,601 --> 00:48:06,790
wife was on that show for one fucking
season?

1032
00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:09,160
And she tried to like,
be like some.

1033
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:12,030
She tried to really play it up like she
was fucking,

1034
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:15,130
Hey,
don't wave the tsunami of hate.

1035
00:48:15,370 --> 00:48:19,120
Well that's the thing.
I think that kind of happens from what

1036
00:48:19,121 --> 00:48:21,750
you're saying about like we're watching
fools is you're nine.

1037
00:48:21,790 --> 00:48:26,790
You're not like,
I'm watching a great piece of art or

1038
00:48:27,521 --> 00:48:28,121
something.
You know,

1039
00:48:28,121 --> 00:48:33,121
we're watching you.
You watch it with this idea that you're

1040
00:48:33,281 --> 00:48:35,350
somehow better than the people you're
watching.

1041
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:39,970
So I think it's like they become
punching bags and that must suck.

1042
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:41,140
Oh,
it's got.

1043
00:48:41,470 --> 00:48:45,220
It has to suck because we'll Kelsey
grammar of course and her or getting a

1044
00:48:45,221 --> 00:48:49,180
divorce and before they got a divorce
she got on the show and when she got on

1045
00:48:49,181 --> 00:48:50,830
the show it was like really weird stuff.

1046
00:48:50,830 --> 00:48:53,890
Like she was hanging out with like
actors and hopping on the motorcycle

1047
00:48:53,891 --> 00:48:56,810
with them and he's my friend and they
drive a good looking guy,

1048
00:48:56,811 --> 00:49:00,340
a fucking great hair and Kelsey
grammer's fat and gross and she's riding

1049
00:49:00,341 --> 00:49:01,690
off.
She's Kinda hot and she used to be in

1050
00:49:01,691 --> 00:49:03,460
playboy.
So the whole thing was like,

1051
00:49:03,461 --> 00:49:08,461
what is going on here?
And she just had this crazy fucking

1052
00:49:08,561 --> 00:49:12,070
shitty attitude and was flaunting it in
front of all these people's face.

1053
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:15,400
But the thing is I had met her before
that and she wasn't really like that at

1054
00:49:15,401 --> 00:49:17,440
all.
It was her reality show.

1055
00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:20,590
It's this thing they do.
They feel like they have to like play it

1056
00:49:20,591 --> 00:49:22,630
up.
And then I met her.

1057
00:49:22,690 --> 00:49:25,460
I saw her at a party in the middle of
that Shell,

1058
00:49:25,461 --> 00:49:29,380
like when the hate was coming down and
she looked like the weight of the

1059
00:49:29,381 --> 00:49:32,000
fucking world was weighing on her like
when she was walking,

1060
00:49:32,050 --> 00:49:33,550
because so many people hated her.

1061
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:34,870
And then she got off the show.
She was like,

1062
00:49:34,871 --> 00:49:37,390
fuck this.
Like she was very smart in that way.

1063
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:40,240
But Kelsey grammer had some interview
where he did.

1064
00:49:40,570 --> 00:49:44,110
He said that's what she always wanted.
So I gave her what she wanted and I knew

1065
00:49:44,111 --> 00:49:47,920
she wasn't even really want it,
but she always said she always wanted

1066
00:49:47,921 --> 00:49:50,650
because that was the whole thing.
Like she had this little video that you

1067
00:49:50,651 --> 00:49:52,600
did at the beginning of the show and the
beginning of his,

1068
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:53,620
uh,
uh,

1069
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:55,630
you know,
I've always been in Kelsey's shadow,

1070
00:49:55,631 --> 00:49:59,540
but it's time for me to step out of all
those shows.

1071
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:03,670
The world know who I am,
letting my star shine.

1072
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:04,840
You know,
one of those things.

1073
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:10,140
And the fucking just the green monster
of hate that descended upon her.

1074
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:15,640
You could feel it.
And I know a couple of those people that

1075
00:50:15,641 --> 00:50:20,641
are on that show and that overwhelming
negative message that you put out by

1076
00:50:21,881 --> 00:50:26,380
being that person and the response to
millions of people hating you,

1077
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:27,980
like literally millions of people

1078
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:30,950
saying you're a dumb cunt,
like it's devastating.

1079
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:36,040
It's devastating because the people
directly respond to whatever message

1080
00:50:36,831 --> 00:50:40,400
that you're putting out there.
And that message is compelling that that

1081
00:50:40,401 --> 00:50:43,910
fucking Beverly Hills housewives,
bitchy message.

1082
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:49,540
I'm going to personify that low petty,
craven bitchiness that probably exists

1083
00:50:53,321 --> 00:50:55,840
in all human beings.
I'm going to be the embodiment of it.

1084
00:50:56,260 --> 00:51:00,660
You think that that like in terms of put
what you put out in the universities,

1085
00:51:00,670 --> 00:51:01,780
brings it back to them.

1086
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:03,580
I don't think it's a distraction
obviously.

1087
00:51:03,581 --> 00:51:04,900
Right?
Those shows are a distraction.

1088
00:51:04,901 --> 00:51:06,880
Like all shows.
I mean you could say that about great

1089
00:51:06,881 --> 00:51:08,590
shows like game of thrones.
It's a distraction.

1090
00:51:08,591 --> 00:51:10,600
Ultimately it's entertaining and what
does entertaining.

1091
00:51:10,601 --> 00:51:13,180
You're sitting there and you're
pretending these things are happening

1092
00:51:13,181 --> 00:51:16,720
and you get to just go off with them.
You get to go.

1093
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:21,190
But there's something different about,
you know that Tyrian lannister isn't

1094
00:51:21,191 --> 00:51:24,220
really Tyrian lannister when you see
these people,

1095
00:51:24,221 --> 00:51:28,120
this is them,
this is their actual face is their

1096
00:51:28,121 --> 00:51:29,050
clothes.
They were,

1097
00:51:29,410 --> 00:51:31,090
this is them talking to these other
people.

1098
00:51:31,091 --> 00:51:35,230
There's cameras on them.
So it's this bizarre distortion of what

1099
00:51:35,231 --> 00:51:36,580
is,
what is reality.

1100
00:51:37,030 --> 00:51:40,480
And also it's been real clear.
There's a formula that's been

1101
00:51:40,481 --> 00:51:43,510
established where if you can be the
bitch on the show that makes a lot of

1102
00:51:43,511 --> 00:51:45,010
noise and you know,
you could,

1103
00:51:45,150 --> 00:51:47,110
you could keep it real and speak your
mind.

1104
00:51:47,590 --> 00:51:50,350
That girl gets a lot of potentials.
You can get a daytime talk show.

1105
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:51,670
And when that girl gets a lot of
attention,

1106
00:51:51,671 --> 00:51:53,530
they keep the camera on her.
When they keep the camera on her,

1107
00:51:53,531 --> 00:51:55,840
the other girls go,
that fucking bitches get all this camera

1108
00:51:55,841 --> 00:51:57,910
time.
Like I know a couple of those girls that

1109
00:51:57,911 --> 00:52:00,390
are outside of it and they'll,
they'll bitch that the,

1110
00:52:00,690 --> 00:52:01,270
you know,
you know,

1111
00:52:01,270 --> 00:52:02,320
brandy,
this and that,

1112
00:52:02,321 --> 00:52:04,210
and now that's why they're fucking
paying attention to her.

1113
00:52:04,211 --> 00:52:05,680
But that fucking bitch and blah blah
blah.

1114
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:08,870
So they get the ramp it up,
they'll ramp up there like,

1115
00:52:08,871 --> 00:52:12,400
like I've decided that this season I'm
going to be more bitchy or I'm this

1116
00:52:12,401 --> 00:52:13,090
season,
I'm gonna,

1117
00:52:13,090 --> 00:52:15,040
you know,
I'm going to be more forceful because

1118
00:52:15,041 --> 00:52:15,970
I've just,
I've sat back,

1119
00:52:16,090 --> 00:52:18,070
I'm not gonna let them edit me because
they edit me,

1120
00:52:18,090 --> 00:52:18,911
you know,
I know what they're doing.

1121
00:52:18,911 --> 00:52:21,010
So what I'm gonna do is I'm not going to
give them anything to edit everything

1122
00:52:21,011 --> 00:52:22,510
they do.
I'm going to fucking hit him like this.

1123
00:52:22,590 --> 00:52:26,290
This is how I feel on it.
He get caught up in this whole wave of

1124
00:52:26,291 --> 00:52:27,124
crazy.

1125
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:28,850
Right?
If trying to manipulate the

1126
00:52:28,851 --> 00:52:29,720
manipulators.

1127
00:52:30,030 --> 00:52:31,590
Yeah.
And then you see it in their faces.

1128
00:52:31,591 --> 00:52:33,720
They're just popping pills and drink it
all the time and,

1129
00:52:34,490 --> 00:52:35,700
and,
and you know,

1130
00:52:35,730 --> 00:52:39,510
dealing with what they asked for.
They wanted this fame and so they get

1131
00:52:39,511 --> 00:52:41,600
it.
But then the also get

1132
00:52:41,730 --> 00:52:45,090
the hate part.
Have you seen,

1133
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:49,620
you know,
a lot of famous people in general?

1134
00:52:49,621 --> 00:52:53,520
Have you seen anyone enjoy fame?
Because I feel like my,

1135
00:52:53,550 --> 00:52:55,620
what I,
from what I've seen it become,

1136
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:58,980
it's a thing that people have to learn
to manage,

1137
00:52:59,010 --> 00:53:00,930
but it's not,
it's never what they thought it was

1138
00:53:00,931 --> 00:53:01,764
going to be.

1139
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:03,430
Kevin Hart doesn't seem to have a
problem with it.

1140
00:53:03,790 --> 00:53:07,120
Kevin Harts and interesting guy because
he is a super positive,

1141
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:08,890
super positive,
super motivated.

1142
00:53:08,891 --> 00:53:11,260
Even people shit on him.
He doesn't shit on them back.

1143
00:53:11,261 --> 00:53:14,380
Like he'll goof around with some comics
that will go after him.

1144
00:53:14,590 --> 00:53:16,660
He'll,
he'll mock them and make fun of them.

1145
00:53:17,050 --> 00:53:19,090
But he's always laughing,
you know,

1146
00:53:19,091 --> 00:53:21,610
he's a really,
really,

1147
00:53:21,611 --> 00:53:25,170
really ambitious guy.
So I think like his level of like what

1148
00:53:25,171 --> 00:53:26,130
he's looking for,
this

1149
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:28,560
is just part of the equation.
And he just keeps going.

1150
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:31,680
I keep wanting to be like an oprah.
He wants to be a mogul,

1151
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:32,600
you know,
his,

1152
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:36,000
his goal.
So He seems to be handling it better

1153
00:53:36,001 --> 00:53:38,400
than anybody I've ever met.
But for most people,

1154
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:40,950
I think we all agree like we've had
conversations about it.

1155
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:43,050
Um,
I've had a conversation about it with a

1156
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:45,840
bunch of different celebrities.
And one thing that everybody seems to

1157
00:53:45,841 --> 00:53:47,520
agree,
if you don't want to ever get as famous

1158
00:53:47,521 --> 00:53:50,640
as Tom Cruise,
there's like a level of fame you don't

1159
00:53:50,641 --> 00:53:52,140
want to hit,
you don't want to be Brad Pitt.

1160
00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:55,920
Like a buddy of mine is friends with
Johnny Depp and he says,

1161
00:53:55,921 --> 00:53:59,220
Johnny Depp can't go anywhere like the.
He hangs out with them.

1162
00:53:59,221 --> 00:54:01,710
There's these guys with earpieces that
follow them everywhere.

1163
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:05,190
And they were in London staying at
Johnny Depp's house and he went to step

1164
00:54:05,191 --> 00:54:08,580
outside to go get some cigarettes and he
walks outside and there's these guys

1165
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:11,080
standing there with earpieces on,
do you need a ride?

1166
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:12,420
Do you need to take you anywhere?
And it's like,

1167
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:16,350
this guy can't go anywhere.
He goes to a restaurant that he goes to

1168
00:54:16,351 --> 00:54:19,110
a restaurant and they swarm on him.
They swarm on him.

1169
00:54:19,710 --> 00:54:22,230
Whereas some people can go to a
restaurant and they can look over there,

1170
00:54:22,231 --> 00:54:22,471
go,
oh,

1171
00:54:22,471 --> 00:54:26,050
that's doug stanhope.
I look overall that's ron white and it's

1172
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:28,410
they're famous,
but they're not.

1173
00:54:28,830 --> 00:54:32,160
It's not a crazy thing to see them.
Here's a perfect example.

1174
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,760
Me and Kevin James,
we're filming a movie.

1175
00:54:34,790 --> 00:54:39,090
We were in Boston and we were hanging
out in his hotel and we're,

1176
00:54:39,130 --> 00:54:44,130
we're joking around and laughing and out
the window looking in front of this

1177
00:54:44,401 --> 00:54:49,401
restaurant.
Tom Cruise was at this restaurant and we

1178
00:54:49,441 --> 00:54:51,330
looked out the window.
We saw Tom Cruise,

1179
00:54:51,331 --> 00:54:55,740
we see people taking pictures of Tom
Cruise and then we see people on the

1180
00:54:55,741 --> 00:54:59,460
street running towards the restaurant of
fucking running,

1181
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:03,180
like running because they heard that Tom
cruise there and we're watching this and

1182
00:55:03,390 --> 00:55:04,430
you know the glasses right here.

1183
00:55:04,450 --> 00:55:07,710
We're pressing up against the grass
glass so we can look at an angle and I

1184
00:55:07,711 --> 00:55:09,240
stopped and I go,
how crazy is I go?

1185
00:55:09,241 --> 00:55:13,160
Here you are.
You're a movie star and you're like

1186
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:18,200
craning your neck to try to get a
glimpse at Tom Cruise on the street at a

1187
00:55:18,871 --> 00:55:22,530
restaurant across the street from.
You can't queens right there.

1188
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:24,780
He's,
but he's that famous,

1189
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:29,760
that famous people freak out when he's
around like he's way too famous.

1190
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:33,450
He's hit some weird,
bizarre level.

1191
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:39,300
Doesn't make any sense.
It's also weird that people do that and

1192
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:42,500
not saying I'm not.
One of them was,

1193
00:55:43,350 --> 00:55:47,070
do you want to be in movies?
You mean you want to be.

1194
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:49,770
If you want to be a superstar and you
want to be in those gigantic

1195
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:52,140
blockbusters that happens,
it can happen.

1196
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:55,650
It doesn't happen to a lot of people,
but for every Samuel Jackson,

1197
00:55:55,651 --> 00:55:57,720
there's 100 dudes who try to be like
that for every.

1198
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:02,640
But for Tom Cruise like that is like as
famous as a person fucking gets in

1199
00:56:02,641 --> 00:56:05,370
America at least there's no more famous
person than that guy.

1200
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:10,290
So when you see that it's compelling and
some sort of strange way.

1201
00:56:10,870 --> 00:56:14,040
Even for a movie star like Kevin James,
he's a fucking famous guy.

1202
00:56:14,130 --> 00:56:16,290
He's filming a movie starring in the
movie,

1203
00:56:16,291 --> 00:56:18,360
looking out the window.
Can't believe you can Tom Cruise.

1204
00:56:18,690 --> 00:56:23,690
It's weird celebrity in some way.
It's like currency

1205
00:56:24,370 --> 00:56:26,830
and I don't mean for the person who is
the celebrity.

1206
00:56:26,831 --> 00:56:29,380
I mean for the.
For the the person who you're like,

1207
00:56:29,410 --> 00:56:31,750
I am seeing something that most people
don't get to see.

1208
00:56:31,751 --> 00:56:36,280
Most people only see in terms of most
people's relationship with Tom Cruise.

1209
00:56:36,281 --> 00:56:40,360
You see cocktail on top gun and all his
most recent films that I'm not naming

1210
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:41,840
because I don't know them,
um,

1211
00:56:42,490 --> 00:56:44,650
excuse me,
but here you are.

1212
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:46,780
Just seeing him at a restaurant.
Like that's something that most people

1213
00:56:46,781 --> 00:56:51,190
don't get to see the rarity or the
scarcity of it.

1214
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:52,061
Um,
you know,

1215
00:56:52,061 --> 00:56:54,760
what else I was thinking in terms of
what it does to our brain.

1216
00:56:54,761 --> 00:56:58,210
When you see someone's face,
that's a huge.

1217
00:56:58,270 --> 00:56:58,871
And you're,
you know,

1218
00:56:58,871 --> 00:57:02,200
when you're sitting in a darkened
theater and someone's fake faces 50,

1219
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:07,120
50 feet tall,
that kind of replicates the way your

1220
00:57:07,121 --> 00:57:10,510
parents and all adults appear to you
when you're a baby.

1221
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:13,300
It's a baby or just sitting there and
there's these faces.

1222
00:57:13,301 --> 00:57:16,310
They're huge and they show up and there
are over you and then they're gone.

1223
00:57:16,311 --> 00:57:17,144
And I don't know,

1224
00:57:17,330 --> 00:57:20,540
do you know that that's what a lot of
psychologist believe,

1225
00:57:20,541 --> 00:57:23,060
or the origins of alien abduction
memories.

1226
00:57:23,810 --> 00:57:27,650
I did not know that they believed the
origins of alien abduction memories have

1227
00:57:27,651 --> 00:57:31,940
to do with birth.
And that's why that clinical strange

1228
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:35,150
setting of being pulled out of your
mother's womb,

1229
00:57:35,330 --> 00:57:40,330
of seeing the light of those in this
really white sterile environment that

1230
00:57:40,881 --> 00:57:45,881
seems cold and harsh and the people with
the masks on surgical masks and big eyes

1231
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:51,700
that you see these things and they
become iconic in your head and you,

1232
00:57:51,701 --> 00:57:55,700
you think of them in,
not in terms of like a person with a

1233
00:57:55,701 --> 00:57:59,690
mask on,
but in terms of this like very strange

1234
00:57:59,691 --> 00:58:03,500
distortion of reality and these are the
first images that a person has.

1235
00:58:03,790 --> 00:58:07,160
That's interesting.
A human brain when they're a baby is

1236
00:58:07,161 --> 00:58:08,360
very,
very tiny,

1237
00:58:08,361 --> 00:58:13,361
but obviously it's still a human brain
and so we don't really know how much

1238
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:18,700
data they store in terms of memories
because we don't have a context.

1239
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:22,010
Like they can't talk about it.
They can't mean people.

1240
00:58:22,011 --> 00:58:25,250
Some people will claim that they have
certain memories from early childhood

1241
00:58:25,251 --> 00:58:26,840
and they might be.
It might be correct,

1242
00:58:27,140 --> 00:58:32,140
but it also might be some sort of a.
A rehashing of memories to the point

1243
00:58:32,601 --> 00:58:34,420
where it's not really a memory.
Just for a minute,

1244
00:58:34,470 --> 00:58:37,880
you've heard what's a memory?
It's remembering how to describe a

1245
00:58:37,881 --> 00:58:41,690
memory you once had like the memory
itself probably doesn't exist anymore.

1246
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:45,890
You have a memory of how you told the
memory and that like really sort of

1247
00:58:45,891 --> 00:58:50,150
distorts it too,
but it think of like visually you've

1248
00:58:50,151 --> 00:58:53,630
never seen anything.
You've been in a womb and then all of a

1249
00:58:53,631 --> 00:58:57,440
sudden you get pulled out and you get
pulled out by a guy with a fucking giant

1250
00:58:57,441 --> 00:59:01,880
light behind him and he's got a mask on
and he's looking at you and you pull it

1251
00:59:01,881 --> 00:59:02,000
all.

1252
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:07,000
You see his eyes and his face and so
that they believed that gets distorted

1253
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:12,880
into this iconic giant head,
black giant eyes and the the cold sort

1254
00:59:13,911 --> 00:59:18,080
of clinicals,
antiseptic room,

1255
00:59:18,081 --> 00:59:23,000
this white room with the light.
That's why everyone has these abduction

1256
00:59:23,030 --> 00:59:26,390
scenarios.
They all deal with medical exams that

1257
00:59:26,391 --> 00:59:29,420
are pretty preposterous.
I mean,

1258
00:59:29,510 --> 00:59:33,890
they're always going up your butt with
stuff and I think that's right where the

1259
00:59:33,891 --> 00:59:35,090
aliens go.
Yeah.

1260
00:59:35,190 --> 00:59:38,110
I think that has to do with.
I think it's vulnerability because like

1261
00:59:38,150 --> 00:59:39,500
you think about your button like,
Hey,

1262
00:59:39,501 --> 00:59:40,330
get out of there.
You know,

1263
00:59:40,330 --> 00:59:41,990
like everybody thinks like that.
Right,

1264
00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:47,020
so I think that's the one thing you'd be
terrified of if the aliens had ultimate

1265
00:59:47,331 --> 00:59:49,340
control over you.
If you couldn't move your body and they

1266
00:59:49,350 --> 00:59:50,061
take,
what are they gonna do?

1267
00:59:50,061 --> 00:59:51,240
They're gonna talk to my body.
Yeah,

1268
00:59:51,270 --> 00:59:52,490
it's going to go inside my body are
going into my,

1269
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:54,020
but like,
you know what I mean?

1270
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:58,190
Was like,
I think that that really makes a lot of

1271
00:59:58,191 --> 00:59:59,170
sense.
That's.

1272
00:59:59,210 --> 01:00:02,000
I'd never heard that before,
but that's really interesting.

1273
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:04,290
That does make sense.
Yeah.

1274
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:07,940
How good your eyes work and then when
you come out of your mother not that.

1275
01:00:07,941 --> 01:00:12,080
Well now everything's hazy.
Everything's hazy and weird in the

1276
01:00:12,210 --> 01:00:13,160
light.
Also,

1277
01:00:13,161 --> 01:00:17,360
you've never seen light before,
so seeing this extreme light as powerful

1278
01:00:17,361 --> 01:00:19,970
light source because everything has to
be really bright so you could really get

1279
01:00:19,971 --> 01:00:22,460
a good look at everything and make sure
you're stitching up the badge.

1280
01:00:22,461 --> 01:00:23,410
Good.
No.

1281
01:00:23,570 --> 01:00:27,080
And getting in there and looking at the
baby and making sure everything's in

1282
01:00:27,081 --> 01:00:30,510
place and then putting that baby in an
incubator like whoa.

1283
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:34,220
If you're a boy,
some oftentimes circumcising,

1284
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:37,090
they don't do it right there.
Now I guess they wait a few days,

1285
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:39,140
still do that.
God,

1286
01:00:39,141 --> 01:00:41,270
I get.
I get text messages or tweets all the

1287
01:00:41,271 --> 01:00:45,260
time from people that support my stance
on circumcision.

1288
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:47,610
I think it's barbaric.
I do too.

1289
01:00:47,660 --> 01:00:49,910
It's creepy.
It's crazy.

1290
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:53,660
The idea that people necessary nowadays
a hundred percent.

1291
01:00:53,870 --> 01:00:56,800
Sorry.
There's this nonsense that it somehow or

1292
01:00:56,801 --> 01:00:57,920
another prevents.
It's like,

1293
01:00:57,921 --> 01:01:00,320
get the fuck out of here.
There's no data.

1294
01:01:00,350 --> 01:01:02,510
Zero.
If you go look at the actual studies

1295
01:01:02,511 --> 01:01:05,330
that try to back it up,
they'll talk about it in third world

1296
01:01:05,331 --> 01:01:09,860
countries like there's still no data.
You can't tell me that you all couldn't

1297
01:01:09,861 --> 01:01:12,830
be the same exact result.
Couldn't be cleaning your Dick.

1298
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:15,500
How about just clean your deck and
they'll cut a baby's deck.

1299
01:01:16,010 --> 01:01:20,480
I know because the amount of pain that I
think that maybe must feel,

1300
01:01:20,570 --> 01:01:22,070
oh well it's.
It's also,

1301
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:26,030
it's traumatic.
It's like you're taking away like a

1302
01:01:26,031 --> 01:01:28,520
certain amount of the child's freedom
and decision making,

1303
01:01:28,521 --> 01:01:32,270
like really early on and you're.
You're cutting them there.

1304
01:01:32,271 --> 01:01:33,350
Cut It for no reason.

1305
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:35,750
Just screaming that in.
A lot of babies lose their decks.

1306
01:01:35,751 --> 01:01:38,120
By the way.
Super Common Infections,

1307
01:01:38,121 --> 01:01:40,550
really common babies,
babies die from it.

1308
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:42,890
I mean it's not like one has ever died
from it.

1309
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:47,920
A bunch died and there's a real problem
with traditional Jewish methods because

1310
01:01:47,931 --> 01:01:52,040
the moyal actual actually sucks on the
penis.

1311
01:01:52,130 --> 01:01:54,790
I'm not making any of this right now.
I'm just saying it's,

1312
01:01:54,890 --> 01:01:59,210
it's disgusting and they transfer herpes
to the baby sometimes and the babies die

1313
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:03,950
and it's not just one but many babies
have died from getting herpes from a

1314
01:02:03,951 --> 01:02:07,880
rabbi sucking on the baby's penis.
Yeah.

1315
01:02:08,150 --> 01:02:13,130
I was watching this youtube video wants
of this guy defending this practice and

1316
01:02:13,131 --> 01:02:13,964
he was a,
you know,

1317
01:02:14,030 --> 01:02:15,890
an old rabbi and it was talking about
how,

1318
01:02:15,950 --> 01:02:18,350
you know,
it's in the faith and if you believe in

1319
01:02:18,351 --> 01:02:22,180
God and God came up with it the right
way and this is

1320
01:02:22,350 --> 01:02:25,840
so.
I don't understand the link between

1321
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:32,960
cutting a piece of for skin or cutting
the forest skin and God like I don't.

1322
01:02:34,030 --> 01:02:37,990
That doesn't work.
I'm not religious person in general,

1323
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:40,570
so these things often don't link up in
my head,

1324
01:02:40,571 --> 01:02:42,580
but it's like how I don't,
I just don't get it.

1325
01:02:42,910 --> 01:02:44,380
How does that have anything to do with
God?

1326
01:02:44,530 --> 01:02:46,720
It's an ancient shit.
It's back when people were stupid as

1327
01:02:46,721 --> 01:02:48,010
fuck.
You know of any data.

1328
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:48,933
It's really.
What is it?

1329
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:52,820
I want to think that we are just as
stupid now as we were then.

1330
01:02:52,870 --> 01:02:53,960
No,
yeah,

1331
01:02:54,070 --> 01:02:54,790
no,
we're not.

1332
01:02:54,790 --> 01:02:57,140
We're not.
We're not as stupid as people who live

1333
01:02:57,141 --> 01:03:01,300
in the 19 twenties watch.
Try to watch a movie from like 1940 and

1334
01:03:01,301 --> 01:03:02,980
watch out.
Dopey people were.

1335
01:03:03,020 --> 01:03:04,900
It was like God.
Everyone was so dumb.

1336
01:03:05,330 --> 01:03:07,690
Like it's like they didn't even know how
to be in color.

1337
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:11,140
There were sad.
There were so strange and childlike and

1338
01:03:11,141 --> 01:03:13,450
a lot of ways like,
and you know,

1339
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:16,540
the other thing is people just,
they didn't have the access to

1340
01:03:16,541 --> 01:03:18,550
information.
They didn't live as long and they didn't

1341
01:03:18,551 --> 01:03:21,920
have anybody around them that had access
to information the way they do.

1342
01:03:22,470 --> 01:03:26,980
You do for every scholar and every
person who is deeply embedded in

1343
01:03:28,270 --> 01:03:32,050
intellectual pursuits.
You had millions and millions of people

1344
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:34,360
that just didn't give a fuck and we're
just trying to get by.

1345
01:03:34,590 --> 01:03:35,610
So you,
I cut you off.

1346
01:03:35,611 --> 01:03:37,770
You were saying that you were watching,
um,

1347
01:03:38,190 --> 01:03:42,120
a rabbi talk about the importance of
circumcision

1348
01:03:42,170 --> 01:03:45,660
to portions of circumcision and doing it
the traditional way where you suck on

1349
01:03:45,661 --> 01:03:49,710
the baby's penis and it was talking
about that there's antiseptic properties

1350
01:03:49,711 --> 01:03:53,430
and saliva and it helps stop the
bleeding.

1351
01:03:53,431 --> 01:03:54,330
Like,
fuck,

1352
01:03:54,540 --> 01:03:59,100
you just don't cause the bleeding.
Just out to stop.

1353
01:03:59,101 --> 01:04:02,010
I was so furious watching this asshole
dress like a wizard.

1354
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:04,620
Talk about sucking on baby Dick's after
they caught them.

1355
01:04:04,621 --> 01:04:06,420
I just wanted to beat the fuck out of
them are really dead.

1356
01:04:06,421 --> 01:04:07,680
It's just like watching.
I was like,

1357
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:12,000
you make me so angry with your stupid
thinking that you're justifying cutting

1358
01:04:12,001 --> 01:04:16,770
a baby's deck and you're talking about
some dumb ass old ancient bullshit there

1359
01:04:16,771 --> 01:04:20,110
was written by morons who thought the
world was flat and you,

1360
01:04:20,111 --> 01:04:23,010
you,
you want to continue that in 2016

1361
01:04:23,011 --> 01:04:26,370
because it's tradition.
It's like it makes me mad.

1362
01:04:26,430 --> 01:04:30,570
It makes me really mad because you're
talking about fucking babies.

1363
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:34,440
If you're a grown adult and you get
sucked into some stupid cult that wants

1364
01:04:34,441 --> 01:04:37,710
to cut your Dick and I let that old dude
suck on it.

1365
01:04:37,950 --> 01:04:39,270
All right man.
How old are you?

1366
01:04:39,271 --> 01:04:40,480
Thirty five.
Good light.

1367
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:42,180
Don't do it.
I'd say don't do it,

1368
01:04:42,181 --> 01:04:44,550
but good luck,
but when you do it to a baby,

1369
01:04:44,551 --> 01:04:49,551
it just makes me fucking furious and you
see this guy you just see in cloaking

1370
01:04:52,110 --> 01:04:57,110
himself in tradition and using it to
justify these like objectively barbaric

1371
01:04:57,750 --> 01:05:01,000
practices.
If you stand back and look at it like a

1372
01:05:01,050 --> 01:05:02,020
analyzing,
like what?

1373
01:05:02,021 --> 01:05:03,140
What benefit is there?
What?

1374
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:04,980
What are the.
What are the risks and what's the

1375
01:05:04,981 --> 01:05:08,430
consequences on what are we doing here?
You sucking on a baby's Dick Dude,

1376
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:11,520
you talking about sucking baby decks?
What?

1377
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,040
How has that.
How has it real?

1378
01:05:14,070 --> 01:05:15,900
Like how is that guy not in jail?

1379
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:18,370
How does that exist in this modern
world?

1380
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:22,420
Imagine though,
if he wasn't in a religion where imagine

1381
01:05:22,450 --> 01:05:24,970
if he just liked cutting baby dixon and
sucking on them.

1382
01:05:24,971 --> 01:05:29,020
You'd fucking have him killed.
But the fact that he can do that,

1383
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:33,340
he can be regarded as an elder and a
scholar and he's got crazy robes on and

1384
01:05:33,370 --> 01:05:36,220
shit.
He's got like a like gilded gold around

1385
01:05:36,221 --> 01:05:38,320
the stupid fucking outfit that he's
wearing.

1386
01:05:38,321 --> 01:05:39,550
And I'm like,
Oh my God,

1387
01:05:39,551 --> 01:05:43,090
you fool.
Are you angry that you were circumcised,

1388
01:05:43,091 --> 01:05:44,670
assuming you were?
No,

1389
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:47,460
because my deck looks perfect.
No,

1390
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:49,930
I,
if I had a chance to do it over again,

1391
01:05:49,931 --> 01:05:52,360
I would definitely say don't do that.
But no,

1392
01:05:52,361 --> 01:05:55,360
it doesn't make me angry.
It's not that I can do about it,

1393
01:05:55,361 --> 01:05:58,390
but it's just a foolhardy practice.
It's just,

1394
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:00,910
it doesn't,
it doesn't help anybody.

1395
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:02,880
It sounded like it.

1396
01:06:03,490 --> 01:06:05,620
Imagine if there was like an improvement
that you can make,

1397
01:06:05,890 --> 01:06:08,800
you know,
like everybody was born unfortunately

1398
01:06:08,801 --> 01:06:11,230
with this flap of skin on their
forehead.

1399
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:13,420
But if you remove that flap of skin,
you know,

1400
01:06:13,421 --> 01:06:15,560
you can read people's minds,
you know,

1401
01:06:15,590 --> 01:06:17,280
oh my God,
Oh yeah,

1402
01:06:17,300 --> 01:06:19,480
I'd take that flap of skin off.
Let's read each other's minds.

1403
01:06:19,481 --> 01:06:21,430
It'd be amazing.
They found out a hack.

1404
01:06:21,490 --> 01:06:24,040
There's like a biohack,
but that's not it.

1405
01:06:24,540 --> 01:06:25,300
It doesn't.
It didn't.

1406
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:26,133
In fact,
it,

1407
01:06:26,770 --> 01:06:30,730
it lessens the pleasure.
It changes the way your penis feels.

1408
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,320
Allegedly,
I wouldn't know,

1409
01:06:32,350 --> 01:06:35,470
but that's what they say.
There's a whole group of people that

1410
01:06:35,471 --> 01:06:38,810
work to bring their for skin back.
How do you do that?

1411
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:44,100
That was apparently that you stretched
the skin slowly over time until it

1412
01:06:44,141 --> 01:06:47,290
regenerates a for skin it had never had.
That was possible.

1413
01:06:47,340 --> 01:06:48,450
Yeah,
that's about it never general

1414
01:06:48,460 --> 01:06:52,240
regenerates a real force skin because
it's always going to be folded over and

1415
01:06:52,241 --> 01:06:56,550
some sort of a strange way,
but the reaction is that it be it

1416
01:06:56,650 --> 01:07:01,650
reignites or re whatever it is,
the mucus membranes.

1417
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:06,820
So you're the tip of your penis.
Sorry to get graphic folks.

1418
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:11,950
It's supposed to have like almost like a
liquid mucusy sort of membrane over it.

1419
01:07:12,130 --> 01:07:13,510
That's all dried out.
Now.

1420
01:07:13,511 --> 01:07:18,100
When dudes get circumcised,
so desensitizes your penis and when your

1421
01:07:18,101 --> 01:07:22,300
penis is encased in skin and the is
pulled back,

1422
01:07:22,301 --> 01:07:24,880
it's much more sensitive and supposedly
much more pleasurable.

1423
01:07:25,630 --> 01:07:28,360
Know who knows if that was a part of the
reason why they started doing it in the

1424
01:07:28,361 --> 01:07:31,810
first place or if it was a hygiene issue
at the time.

1425
01:07:31,811 --> 01:07:33,730
People didn't know that much about
washing.

1426
01:07:33,970 --> 01:07:34,870
Who knows?
Who knows?

1427
01:07:34,871 --> 01:07:37,240
What was the initial urge?
You know,

1428
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:38,650
Mitch,
I'm sure it's under debate,

1429
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:43,800
but did you see the headlines yesterday
about how science has.

1430
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:49,540
They've,
they've developed this some sub second

1431
01:07:49,541 --> 01:07:51,820
skin,
second skin for that.

1432
01:07:52,450 --> 01:07:53,530
Yeah,
I guess.

1433
01:07:53,860 --> 01:07:56,320
Yeah,
but that seems like it would actually do

1434
01:07:56,321 --> 01:07:57,220
the opposite.

1435
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:00,120
Well,
maybe if you kept it on every day.

1436
01:08:00,130 --> 01:08:03,090
I guess you're right.
I think if you kept it on everyday,

1437
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:05,980
what the thing about that second skin
though that's interesting is that

1438
01:08:05,981 --> 01:08:07,450
they're,
they think that they're going to be able

1439
01:08:07,451 --> 01:08:11,500
to use it for medication,
like for people that have psoriasis or

1440
01:08:11,501 --> 01:08:14,170
Eczema,
they can put medication on and then put

1441
01:08:14,171 --> 01:08:17,810
that second skin on second skin will
actually hold the medication in place.

1442
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:22,220
He has a second skin things.
That trip I was watching,

1443
01:08:22,221 --> 01:08:26,750
they did it to this old lady's face and
it just sucked it back in or bags under

1444
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:27,950
my eyes,
like normal,

1445
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:29,690
a seminar.
It's invisible.

1446
01:08:30,230 --> 01:08:33,410
It's really weird line for your face,
but better because you can kind of see

1447
01:08:33,420 --> 01:08:35,900
invisalign.
It's going to change the way people's

1448
01:08:35,901 --> 01:08:38,450
faces look,
but the people that did the Joan rivers

1449
01:08:38,451 --> 01:08:41,270
thing that just filled their face up
with rubber and stretched it all out

1450
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:42,673
there fucked.

1451
01:08:42,830 --> 01:08:46,550
They're fucked.
Like all the early adopters of surgery

1452
01:08:46,551 --> 01:08:49,880
and fillers and all that craziness that
people have done to their lips and

1453
01:08:51,620 --> 01:08:54,970
there's this lady that I know,
I don't call her monster face to face,

1454
01:08:54,980 --> 01:08:59,980
but
she's a type of look that I call monster

1455
01:09:00,111 --> 01:09:02,090
face.
A lot of women have it.

1456
01:09:02,170 --> 01:09:04,010
Yeah,
but that monster face thing,

1457
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:08,540
what happens is they stretch their face
out so much that their mouth is way too

1458
01:09:08,541 --> 01:09:11,930
big.
Like their lips go way over here.

1459
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:15,290
You're not supposed to go over here,
but they're doing this because they're

1460
01:09:15,291 --> 01:09:17,840
just pulling it up.
They're pulling a face back so much that

1461
01:09:17,841 --> 01:09:19,550
when they.
When they smile and they open their

1462
01:09:19,551 --> 01:09:22,130
mouth,
you start doing the FIBONACCI sequence

1463
01:09:22,131 --> 01:09:24,920
in your mind and you go,
something's wrong because there's a

1464
01:09:24,921 --> 01:09:26,890
natural,
like your nose,

1465
01:09:26,910 --> 01:09:31,370
the correct size for your eyes and your
lips and your chin and your face and we

1466
01:09:31,371 --> 01:09:33,620
all have like,
there's a symmetry to it,

1467
01:09:33,650 --> 01:09:37,820
a human face and there's a sequence that
the fibonacci sequence you can actually

1468
01:09:37,940 --> 01:09:38,660
calculate it.

1469
01:09:38,660 --> 01:09:41,330
FIBONACCI had to do with facial features
and stuff.

1470
01:09:41,331 --> 01:09:44,600
I've heard a FIBONACCI but I didn't
realize it has to do with a lot of

1471
01:09:44,601 --> 01:09:48,140
different features that exist in nature.
Like pine cones,

1472
01:09:48,170 --> 01:09:51,930
nautilus shells.
I've heard it used when I'm.

1473
01:09:52,070 --> 01:09:55,760
So I used to play in a band and so when
my friends tend to recording studios and

1474
01:09:55,761 --> 01:09:58,820
I know that it was used to like figure
out acoustic nodes,

1475
01:09:58,970 --> 01:10:01,700
I think some,
some pattern of sound waves.

1476
01:10:01,730 --> 01:10:06,260
Well tool did a whole song with the
fibonacci sequence,

1477
01:10:06,450 --> 01:10:07,283
you know,
they,

1478
01:10:07,340 --> 01:10:08,180
they,
um,

1479
01:10:08,570 --> 01:10:13,250
they figured out a way to incorporate
the sequence into the way the lyrics are

1480
01:10:13,251 --> 01:10:15,170
structured and the way that the beats
are structured.

1481
01:10:15,710 --> 01:10:17,090
But there's,
when you,

1482
01:10:17,150 --> 01:10:21,410
the ratio of a person's face gets
distorted with plastic surgery and it's

1483
01:10:21,411 --> 01:10:24,800
one of the things that's upsetting when
you see someone they've got like crazy

1484
01:10:24,801 --> 01:10:26,030
fake lips,
like Whoa,

1485
01:10:26,031 --> 01:10:27,550
what's going on with your lips,
you know,

1486
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:30,320
or whatever,
or knows what is going on with her.

1487
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:35,600
So I think that when we change things,
what does this jamie sequence and

1488
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:37,320
natural.
Yeah.

1489
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:37,971
Yeah.
So,

1490
01:10:37,971 --> 01:10:40,700
okay.
So it's showing the um,

1491
01:10:41,270 --> 01:10:44,360
the sequence as applied to the human
face,

1492
01:10:45,290 --> 01:10:47,810
but it's applied to everything
apparently.

1493
01:10:48,860 --> 01:10:53,000
But I think when you see it as pretty
cool and see it sunflowers when you see

1494
01:10:53,001 --> 01:10:53,834
it in,
um,

1495
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:58,730
in human faces after surgery,
I think that's one of the reasons why

1496
01:10:58,731 --> 01:11:02,210
there's like an automatic,
like repelling response.

1497
01:11:02,211 --> 01:11:04,100
Like it pulls you back.
Like,

1498
01:11:04,101 --> 01:11:07,460
Whoa,
what I wonder is because I feel like I'm

1499
01:11:07,461 --> 01:11:11,210
really good at spotting plastic surgery,
but I wonder how many people walked by

1500
01:11:11,211 --> 01:11:14,160
and I don't like people who have good
plastic

1501
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:17,040
surgery where you just don't notice it
and you just think they're attractive.

1502
01:11:17,170 --> 01:11:18,690
Like that must exist.

1503
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:21,730
There's definitely some subtle prostate
surgery that they've done really well.

1504
01:11:22,020 --> 01:11:26,560
Like there's some subtle facelifts and
some things along those lines that uh,

1505
01:11:27,270 --> 01:11:28,720
another person I know,
I know this lady,

1506
01:11:28,721 --> 01:11:32,470
she's like 60 and she looks hot.
It's pretty hot and she's had a gang of

1507
01:11:32,471 --> 01:11:34,000
shit done.
Maybe too much.

1508
01:11:34,210 --> 01:11:38,320
Like she may be like a obsesses a little
bit nips and tucks.

1509
01:11:38,321 --> 01:11:39,820
But you look at her,
you're like,

1510
01:11:39,821 --> 01:11:41,220
God damn,
she's 60.

1511
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:43,500
Like she looks really good.
She but you know,

1512
01:11:43,540 --> 01:11:45,720
they do a little of this,
a little desk.

1513
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:49,830
But then I know monster face and you
know,

1514
01:11:49,831 --> 01:11:52,210
she's got a mouth.
It looks like a good eat a baby's head.

1515
01:11:52,630 --> 01:11:54,310
Like she,
she just looks like a monster.

1516
01:11:54,340 --> 01:11:57,760
Like her cheeks are huge.
Is she happy with how she looks at you?

1517
01:11:57,770 --> 01:11:59,260
The fuck knows.
I don't know her that well,

1518
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:02,110
but are actually this girl stopped up
with rubber.

1519
01:12:02,530 --> 01:12:06,400
They do weird stuff where it looks like
they just had mouth surgery where their

1520
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:11,350
jaws are swollen because they feel like
so much puffing out their face.

1521
01:12:11,351 --> 01:12:12,610
Remove some of the wrinkles.

1522
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:15,850
I see.
So it was funny in a town that prizes

1523
01:12:15,851 --> 01:12:19,540
being skinny so much.
I see so many people.

1524
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:24,400
Men to have these like balloony faces
because there is just filled with,

1525
01:12:24,401 --> 01:12:26,520
I don't know if it's botox or juvederm.
I don't know.

1526
01:12:26,521 --> 01:12:28,810
I.
I have not had any of that done,

1527
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:31,000
so I don't really know,
but it's like,

1528
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:32,470
yeah,
their faces.

1529
01:12:32,471 --> 01:12:35,200
It looks like it looks like they're
puffing them out.

1530
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:37,400
It will look.
So there's.

1531
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:39,010
They're filled with irritant is what it
is.

1532
01:12:39,390 --> 01:12:41,040
Yeah.
Well there's an actual physical

1533
01:12:41,041 --> 01:12:45,720
substance in there that's making their
face thicker to get rid of the lines.

1534
01:12:46,350 --> 01:12:48,180
Yeah.
All that stuff is going to go away.

1535
01:12:48,380 --> 01:12:51,420
They're.
They're on the verge of releasing.

1536
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:56,480
There's a guy in Germany that created
this procedure called Regena keen and

1537
01:12:56,491 --> 01:13:00,180
Regena keen is they take your blood,
they spin it in a centrifuge and the

1538
01:13:00,181 --> 01:13:04,890
heated up and then they take the.
There's like a yellow serum that gets

1539
01:13:04,891 --> 01:13:08,190
developed in your blood and it's a
direct response to the heat.

1540
01:13:08,330 --> 01:13:10,500
Your.
Your body reacts as if it's in a flu and

1541
01:13:10,501 --> 01:13:12,480
it produces these radical
antiinflammatories.

1542
01:13:12,481 --> 01:13:16,110
They take these inflammatories and they
inject it into injured areas and all

1543
01:13:16,111 --> 01:13:17,190
these athletes like coby

1544
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:19,250
Brianne.
It's crazy.

1545
01:13:19,251 --> 01:13:22,070
I just read about this,
the wonderful athlete.

1546
01:13:22,071 --> 01:13:25,640
Kim Kardashians did it.
They call it a plasma facial.

1547
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:27,110
Okay.
That's different.

1548
01:13:27,290 --> 01:13:30,080
That's still a blood in a centrifuge and
then heated

1549
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:30,953
up.
That's um,

1550
01:13:31,380 --> 01:13:34,110
that's um,
a bullshit.

1551
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:34,721
No,
no,

1552
01:13:34,721 --> 01:13:35,011
no,
no,

1553
01:13:35,011 --> 01:13:35,311
no,
no,

1554
01:13:35,311 --> 01:13:36,410
no.
It's,

1555
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:39,170
it's a type of plasma.
Um,

1556
01:13:39,450 --> 01:13:40,890
fuck.
What was it called?

1557
01:13:42,090 --> 01:13:44,160
Um,
I forget what they're called,

1558
01:13:44,161 --> 01:13:45,540
but it's similar.
It's similar.

1559
01:13:45,570 --> 01:13:47,460
I forget the,
the procedures named something.

1560
01:13:47,461 --> 01:13:49,650
Plasma.
Plasma.

1561
01:13:49,830 --> 01:13:52,740
Fucking God damn it.
Why don't I not remember this?

1562
01:13:52,741 --> 01:13:56,190
Anyway,
it's similar but not the same.

1563
01:13:56,220 --> 01:14:00,090
This regena king thing involves heat and
in devolves your blood's response to the

1564
01:14:00,091 --> 01:14:03,290
heat and then taking that serum and
injecting it back by point being that

1565
01:14:03,291 --> 01:14:08,291
same doctor that created this procedure
created a new procedure that restarts

1566
01:14:08,671 --> 01:14:12,280
the body's production of Collagen.
So what wrinkles are,

1567
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:16,600
is your body loses its elasticity and it
starts to give in and starts to get

1568
01:14:16,870 --> 01:14:19,750
sloppy and loose.
And that's why people get facelifts.

1569
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:22,000
Well,
with his new procedure,

1570
01:14:22,001 --> 01:14:24,910
he's going to restart your body's
production of Collagen.

1571
01:14:24,940 --> 01:14:27,160
You're going to develop college and like
a 20 year old.

1572
01:14:27,220 --> 01:14:29,710
Wow.
Which is fucking freaky because that's

1573
01:14:29,711 --> 01:14:31,090
all it is.
It's not,

1574
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:33,790
it's not something like you're asking
people to,

1575
01:14:33,850 --> 01:14:37,330
you know,
be able to jump 10 feet higher,

1576
01:14:37,350 --> 01:14:39,040
you like,
it's not insurmountable.

1577
01:14:39,041 --> 01:14:42,670
It's just a simple matter of the body
not producing as much as something that

1578
01:14:42,671 --> 01:14:45,160
it used to produce.
So they figured out a way to get it to

1579
01:14:45,161 --> 01:14:47,380
do.
So instead of pulling your face back and

1580
01:14:47,381 --> 01:14:49,000
stuffing it with rubber and all that
stuff.

1581
01:14:49,330 --> 01:14:52,870
Are there health benefits to that?
Or is that just vanity?

1582
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:56,470
Because like you know earlier we were
talking about that is,

1583
01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:59,590
is being in the gym all the time about
vanity.

1584
01:14:59,770 --> 01:15:02,080
I would say if you're 80 and you need to
look 20,

1585
01:15:02,081 --> 01:15:04,180
that's vanity.
I mean ask me when I'm 80,

1586
01:15:04,270 --> 01:15:06,130
but it's like why does everyone need to
look?

1587
01:15:06,131 --> 01:15:07,810
So you look better when you're 20

1588
01:15:08,220 --> 01:15:09,810
so if you want to look better,
do it.

1589
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:11,550
It's really simple.
Is it vanity?

1590
01:15:11,551 --> 01:15:13,380
Well there's a vanity.
When you cut your hair,

1591
01:15:13,430 --> 01:15:15,000
is it vanity?
When you wear nice clothes?

1592
01:15:15,001 --> 01:15:16,320
The vanity,
when you wash your face,

1593
01:15:16,710 --> 01:15:17,543
when you were making.

1594
01:15:17,610 --> 01:15:21,760
I think about especially used to think
about that all the time because I really

1595
01:15:21,910 --> 01:15:25,840
wanted a nose job for the longest time.
I never got one.

1596
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:29,050
Sometimes I still
need to do that.

1597
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:30,850
You have a beautiful nose.
Thank you.

1598
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:32,480
Um,
that's a mind.

1599
01:15:32,481 --> 01:15:34,230
Fuck,
wait,

1600
01:15:34,250 --> 01:15:36,360
what is a mind fuck?
What's wrong with my nose?

1601
01:15:38,050 --> 01:15:39,580
And my fear is always like,
well,

1602
01:15:39,581 --> 01:15:43,900
what if I end up with some stupid tiny
nose that doesn't look right on my face

1603
01:15:43,901 --> 01:15:47,080
and then I can't get it back.
And plus I feel like that's just,

1604
01:15:47,470 --> 01:15:50,050
that's just going too far.
But then I think.

1605
01:15:50,051 --> 01:15:53,020
But you know,
I had braces so my teeth looked

1606
01:15:53,021 --> 01:15:55,240
different than they would have looked
otherwise.

1607
01:15:55,450 --> 01:15:58,870
And I straightened my hair and I looked
better with straight hair.

1608
01:15:58,871 --> 01:16:02,350
I looked better with straight teeth.
I like all these little things.

1609
01:16:02,351 --> 01:16:07,351
So why is that one different?
And it just is because it involves,

1610
01:16:07,690 --> 01:16:10,360
you know,
undergoing a procedure and I sort of

1611
01:16:10,361 --> 01:16:12,820
don't.
Well here's the thing,

1612
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:16,720
I don't agree with doing it,
but still it's like where do you draw

1613
01:16:16,721 --> 01:16:18,880
the line?
If you were born with a weird hump on

1614
01:16:18,881 --> 01:16:21,580
your nose and they straightened that out
and all of a sudden you're a beautiful.

1615
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:23,140
Yeah.
That can happen.

1616
01:16:23,620 --> 01:16:24,371
That can happen.
I mean,

1617
01:16:24,371 --> 01:16:25,440
there's people that.
Why don't we?

1618
01:16:25,510 --> 01:16:26,740
Why is that?
Okay,

1619
01:16:26,830 --> 01:16:29,320
but just a nip tuck we've decided is
not.

1620
01:16:29,540 --> 01:16:31,070
Well,
it's not that it's not okay.

1621
01:16:31,170 --> 01:16:34,550
You can do whatever the fuck you want,
but it's a rabbit hole.

1622
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:37,070
If you.
If you go down that I want to get a nose

1623
01:16:37,071 --> 01:16:37,731
job,
rabbit hole,

1624
01:16:37,731 --> 01:16:39,820
you might go.
I think my eyebrows be better if there

1625
01:16:39,821 --> 01:16:40,654
were an inch.

1626
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:42,330
Oh,
are you saying there would be no,

1627
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:43,680
but you know,
you'd be like,

1628
01:16:44,540 --> 01:16:48,250
well that's the argument against a way
to make my lips just a little tucker

1629
01:16:48,270 --> 01:16:50,670
this on that.
Listen to this.

1630
01:16:51,260 --> 01:16:56,260
I want this tiny little.
That's what stops me from starting any

1631
01:16:56,581 --> 01:17:01,320
of that is that I don't want to be
monster faced because it's so easy to go

1632
01:17:01,321 --> 01:17:02,150
like,
oh yeah,

1633
01:17:02,150 --> 01:17:04,440
you know,
my upper lip is not as full as my lower

1634
01:17:04,441 --> 01:17:06,510
lip.
Maybe I could change that or like I feel

1635
01:17:06,511 --> 01:17:08,850
like I'm beginning to get lines here.
Maybe I could do something,

1636
01:17:08,851 --> 01:17:10,010
you know,
like there's all those

1637
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:14,360
sections in there at some filler in just
bucket from a little fat around the

1638
01:17:14,361 --> 01:17:16,640
outside of my lips,
but I don't have the wrinkles will be

1639
01:17:16,641 --> 01:17:17,690
happy or like,
hey,

1640
01:17:17,691 --> 01:17:19,400
maybe some of this fat can we moved
here.

1641
01:17:19,430 --> 01:17:21,050
Next thing you know there's an alien up
your butt.

1642
01:17:21,340 --> 01:17:23,330
Will help.
Helps people take some of the fat,

1643
01:17:23,331 --> 01:17:25,880
other inner thigh only injected in their
ass and I'll sign it.

1644
01:17:25,881 --> 01:17:29,610
Looks like they're wearing a diaper.
I know a lady went that done about that.

1645
01:17:29,970 --> 01:17:33,260
Are you hanging out with
white people?

1646
01:17:33,261 --> 01:17:35,540
Live all this older white people with
money.

1647
01:17:36,110 --> 01:17:39,170
They just panic and start sticking stuff
in their body,

1648
01:17:39,410 --> 01:17:40,940
but she looks like she's wearing a
diaper.

1649
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:44,100
She's got these little popsicle legs
like she doesn't know.

1650
01:17:44,150 --> 01:17:49,150
She unhappy with her flat,
but before I don't know that well know

1651
01:17:49,180 --> 01:17:50,930
that she had some stuff injecting her
ass.

1652
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:52,760
She's not.
The only one I know is don't either.

1653
01:17:52,761 --> 01:17:55,220
I know quite a few people have done it.
It's a bizarre practice.

1654
01:17:55,270 --> 01:17:57,700
There's our.
Are you familiar with waist training?

1655
01:17:57,910 --> 01:18:00,670
I only learned about this recently.
That's another crazy thing,

1656
01:18:00,671 --> 01:18:05,671
but I was at the grocery store and I saw
this woman with this gigantic ass

1657
01:18:06,190 --> 01:18:08,860
gigantic thighs,
like big,

1658
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:10,391
tiny,
tiny,

1659
01:18:10,391 --> 01:18:14,680
tiny little waist.
I was so turned on.

1660
01:18:15,530 --> 01:18:18,290
No,
it was very unnatural

1661
01:18:18,350 --> 01:18:21,810
gang.
A friend of mine got with this girl once

1662
01:18:22,050 --> 01:18:25,500
and they hooked up and they got together
and start fooling around and she had a

1663
01:18:25,501 --> 01:18:28,280
thick waste and it freaked him out.
She said,

1664
01:18:28,340 --> 01:18:31,980
he said that she was boxy.
He said she went from her shoulder down

1665
01:18:31,981 --> 01:18:35,340
to her hips and it was a straight line
and I was like,

1666
01:18:35,420 --> 01:18:36,450
wow.
Freaked you out.

1667
01:18:36,451 --> 01:18:37,380
Like how it goes.
I just,

1668
01:18:37,410 --> 01:18:38,370
I had to leave.
I go,

1669
01:18:38,371 --> 01:18:43,371
what the geometry of your body like the
fact that it didn't go.

1670
01:18:43,670 --> 01:18:44,850
I go,
she's pretty,

1671
01:18:44,851 --> 01:18:46,260
and he goes,
I never met the girl.

1672
01:18:46,550 --> 01:18:47,490
I go,
she's pretty.

1673
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:48,061
He goes,
yeah,

1674
01:18:48,061 --> 01:18:49,020
she's beautiful.
I go,

1675
01:18:49,021 --> 01:18:50,550
hold on.
She's beautiful,

1676
01:18:50,551 --> 01:18:55,050
but her body was too square.
Did you notice that before you got

1677
01:18:55,051 --> 01:18:55,820
together?
He goes,

1678
01:18:55,820 --> 01:19:00,240
I didn't think it would be a big deal,
but when we got together it was a big

1679
01:19:00,241 --> 01:19:02,160
deal and I'm like,
Whoa,

1680
01:19:02,750 --> 01:19:06,050
well yeah.
At least he's trying to look at the

1681
01:19:06,051 --> 01:19:07,730
things that really matter.
Um.

1682
01:19:07,940 --> 01:19:09,500
What kind of woman does your friend
normally?

1683
01:19:09,501 --> 01:19:11,810
I'm sorry,
I'm being so fucking judgment hungry

1684
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:17,240
artist side instead of just being like a
nose job or braces or something.

1685
01:19:17,910 --> 01:19:22,100
It's one thing like the boxy body,
like this fucking piece of shit.

1686
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:22,630
Like,
well,

1687
01:19:22,630 --> 01:19:26,120
you know why?
Because I walk around with like,

1688
01:19:26,121 --> 01:19:29,000
there's like 19 things about me.
I'm not into,

1689
01:19:29,001 --> 01:19:29,900
but I'm like,
oh,

1690
01:19:29,930 --> 01:19:31,490
whatever.
People won't notice.

1691
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:36,800
And then like I never even thought of
the level of boxiness of a body being

1692
01:19:36,801 --> 01:19:40,580
something.
I mean I'm married so I'm not out there

1693
01:19:40,581 --> 01:19:43,310
trying to impress people with my body.
Not Be boxy.

1694
01:19:43,790 --> 01:19:45,710
I can be boxy.
I've got that freedom,

1695
01:19:45,740 --> 01:19:49,160
but I'm just saying I didn't know I
needed to worry about that.

1696
01:19:49,460 --> 01:19:51,830
Well you don't need to worry about it
unless you were hanging out with my

1697
01:19:51,831 --> 01:19:52,664
retarded friend.

1698
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:56,740
But if you were,
well is he retarded when definitely

1699
01:19:57,070 --> 01:19:59,720
retarded comes to that kind of stuff.
He's retarded when comes to everything.

1700
01:19:59,830 --> 01:20:00,590
Oh,
okay.

1701
01:20:00,590 --> 01:20:05,590
But I was just amazed that he left this
girl's place because she had a boxy body

1702
01:20:06,140 --> 01:20:06,711
was.
I mean,

1703
01:20:06,711 --> 01:20:10,170
would he have had sex with her?
Otherwise he would have stuck it in the

1704
01:20:10,171 --> 01:20:12,180
boxes box.
The boxes box.

1705
01:20:12,210 --> 01:20:13,860
Yes.
It's like that joke could have come off

1706
01:20:13,861 --> 01:20:18,750
better.
The execution invite me back some day

1707
01:20:18,751 --> 01:20:19,970
and I'm only going to have that one.
Perfect.

1708
01:20:19,971 --> 01:20:22,950
It is our first go at it.
I'll have a different face by then,

1709
01:20:22,980 --> 01:20:26,280
but that joke will pretend to ignore it.
Yeah.

1710
01:20:26,930 --> 01:20:30,620
Yeah.
I remember I was in the Irvine Improv.

1711
01:20:30,650 --> 01:20:32,720
No,
Bray Bray Improv.

1712
01:20:33,010 --> 01:20:35,300
We're in the green room and we're
waiting to go on.

1713
01:20:35,301 --> 01:20:38,330
And we were just barbecued high,
like really,

1714
01:20:38,331 --> 01:20:42,740
really stoned and was watching TV and it
was comedy central was on comedy

1715
01:20:42,741 --> 01:20:44,410
central,
one of those shows where,

1716
01:20:44,430 --> 01:20:46,220
um,
uh,

1717
01:20:46,250 --> 01:20:48,370
before she died,
um,

1718
01:20:49,650 --> 01:20:51,200
her name,
Joan Rivers,

1719
01:20:51,201 --> 01:20:55,190
Joan Rivers,
Joan rivers had full on rubber face and

1720
01:20:55,220 --> 01:20:58,080
she was on the screen.
And when you're really high,

1721
01:20:58,110 --> 01:20:58,960
things like that,
just,

1722
01:20:59,290 --> 01:21:01,520
they just glaring stand out.
And I,

1723
01:21:01,580 --> 01:21:03,980
and I just go and I just held my hand up
to my face,

1724
01:21:03,981 --> 01:21:04,970
like the home alone kid.
I was like,

1725
01:21:04,971 --> 01:21:07,620
oh no.
Oh No.

1726
01:21:07,790 --> 01:21:11,360
Like what is going on here?
I count was anybody how.

1727
01:21:11,460 --> 01:21:16,190
How was just like letting this go on was
how come someone doesn't step in and go,

1728
01:21:16,191 --> 01:21:18,440
what the fuck you doing?
You can do this.

1729
01:21:18,441 --> 01:21:21,890
This is crazy.
Her whole head was just rubber and

1730
01:21:21,891 --> 01:21:24,260
inflated.
Nothing was moving,

1731
01:21:24,261 --> 01:21:26,090
nothing was moving.
The forehead wasn't moving,

1732
01:21:26,390 --> 01:21:27,830
the cheeks weren't moving.
I'm like,

1733
01:21:28,280 --> 01:21:31,610
Whoa,
this is a total new kind of face that

1734
01:21:31,611 --> 01:21:32,750
never existed before,

1735
01:21:33,090 --> 01:21:38,090
that we see on tv all the time.
That always shocks me or frightens me.

1736
01:21:38,781 --> 01:21:41,530
That idea that what if I couldn't have
an expressions?

1737
01:21:41,650 --> 01:21:43,960
Yeah.
What if couldn't do this?

1738
01:21:45,060 --> 01:21:46,700
I can't do that.
You can't.

1739
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:50,120
But that's so important.
I think that's so important for.

1740
01:21:50,180 --> 01:21:53,630
If you're going to be on camera,
having a face that displays emotion is

1741
01:21:53,631 --> 01:21:55,640
important.
So why would you want to humble yourself

1742
01:21:55,641 --> 01:21:56,474
to that degree?

1743
01:21:56,510 --> 01:21:59,150
That's really interesting.
You brought this up because I was

1744
01:21:59,151 --> 01:22:04,151
watching boxing this weekend and Canelo
Alvarez fought Amir Khan and I'm,

1745
01:22:04,750 --> 01:22:08,210
they're doing this thing now in boxing.
It's really weird.

1746
01:22:08,660 --> 01:22:10,860
Where when the,
um,

1747
01:22:11,180 --> 01:22:15,800
post-fight ring announcer is
interviewing the fighters.

1748
01:22:15,801 --> 01:22:17,900
Who is Max Kellerman who is interviewing
the fighter.

1749
01:22:17,901 --> 01:22:22,901
She's asking these questions.
They have these girls stand right there.

1750
01:22:23,390 --> 01:22:26,520
These really pretty girls like,
stand for like,

1751
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:31,040
like as if they're his friends and they
stand right next to them and it's so

1752
01:22:31,041 --> 01:22:33,860
fucking distracting.
And this one girl,

1753
01:22:33,980 --> 01:22:36,920
I don't know if she has botox or for
faces just naturally shiny.

1754
01:22:36,950 --> 01:22:39,650
She looks like really young.
Like I don't think she has botox,

1755
01:22:40,130 --> 01:22:42,890
but she's just sitting there like a
smile,

1756
01:22:42,891 --> 01:22:45,680
like half expression and she probably
can move her face.

1757
01:22:45,681 --> 01:22:48,740
It's probably all in my head,
but all I'm thinking of is fucking heads

1758
01:22:48,741 --> 01:22:49,550
frozen.
The Fred's,

1759
01:22:49,550 --> 01:22:51,690
she's only,
she could have had 29 years old.

1760
01:22:51,790 --> 01:22:52,770
Yeah.
Isn't racism.

1761
01:22:53,330 --> 01:22:58,190
People do Botox now,
but that's how bold vanderpump rules.

1762
01:22:58,310 --> 01:23:00,350
Sorry to bring it up again.
Why would they do that?

1763
01:23:00,380 --> 01:23:02,180
Why would they do that?
If their face is not wrinkled?

1764
01:23:02,470 --> 01:23:05,280
Apparently according to one of the guys,
it's,

1765
01:23:05,320 --> 01:23:06,550
it's a preventative.

1766
01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:10,270
They're getting interviewed.
See the girl behind him.

1767
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:13,900
She's very pretty beautiful girl.
Her fucking forehead hasn't moved in

1768
01:23:13,901 --> 01:23:16,500
months.
That God damn thing is frozen.

1769
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:18,130
Face looks.
Plastic does it.

1770
01:23:18,430 --> 01:23:20,980
To me.
It was pretty hot seat.

1771
01:23:21,550 --> 01:23:23,440
That's a certain amount of plastic I'll
tolerate,

1772
01:23:24,550 --> 01:23:26,140
but it's just.
It was freaking me out.

1773
01:23:26,141 --> 01:23:29,200
I was like,
why is there a wiser skin frozen?

1774
01:23:29,830 --> 01:23:32,110
Is that just seeing her in the back?
It's hard to tell,

1775
01:23:32,890 --> 01:23:37,090
but it was like there's like a shyness
to foreheads when they do that shit.

1776
01:23:37,150 --> 01:23:40,160
Like there's like an artificial shyness
to it.

1777
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:43,300
It's like it's pull.
It's not even that it's pulled back,

1778
01:23:43,301 --> 01:23:44,920
but he was zapped.
It,

1779
01:23:45,460 --> 01:23:49,690
zapped it and froze it.
A little tiny micro muscular.

1780
01:23:49,691 --> 01:23:52,210
Things aren't happening and it's
paralyzed.

1781
01:23:52,240 --> 01:23:57,010
Botulism.
I know you're injecting botulism in your

1782
01:23:57,011 --> 01:24:01,000
fucking face to keep it from moving.
You're paralyzing your face.

1783
01:24:02,020 --> 01:24:05,050
I know lady who did it and it went bad.
She got a cheap one done and our eye

1784
01:24:05,051 --> 01:24:07,780
droop down like those six weeks.
Yeah,

1785
01:24:07,810 --> 01:24:12,200
six weeks later for six weeks it looked
like fucking Arturo Gotti was like.

1786
01:24:12,340 --> 01:24:14,380
It was like somebody had been beating on
her with Jabs.

1787
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:15,221
Yeah,
I know.

1788
01:24:15,221 --> 01:24:17,800
I know.
If someone has a side of her mouth and

1789
01:24:17,801 --> 01:24:21,290
she was a newscaster side of my mouth,
drooped her tail.

1790
01:24:21,480 --> 01:24:23,020
When it came back,
what did she do?

1791
01:24:23,490 --> 01:24:25,300
So the newscast,
she.

1792
01:24:25,301 --> 01:24:26,830
I don't know if she went on.
I only.

1793
01:24:26,831 --> 01:24:31,300
I heard about it from other people.
I'm sure she was freaking out about it.

1794
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:32,193
Oh my God.
Yeah.

1795
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:37,800
Fucking what a weird problem to have.
I injected too much botulism in the side

1796
01:24:38,411 --> 01:24:43,411
of my face and now I drool when I eat.
That's what honestly scares me about all

1797
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:49,930
that stuff is the idea of something
going wrong that is don't trust anyone

1798
01:24:49,931 --> 01:24:51,610
enough to let them do that.

1799
01:24:51,630 --> 01:24:54,230
We'll also those when they inject the
botulism,

1800
01:24:54,730 --> 01:24:58,450
there's like a lot of different levels
of people that are good at it and Shitty

1801
01:24:58,451 --> 01:25:00,100
at it and some people they,
you know,

1802
01:25:00,101 --> 01:25:01,840
there's people that think more is
better,

1803
01:25:02,270 --> 01:25:06,100
so more of that stuff in there and just
freeze the whole fucking thing.

1804
01:25:06,310 --> 01:25:07,960
People do it to their arms.
Did you know that?

1805
01:25:08,350 --> 01:25:09,820
They do it to different parts of their
body.

1806
01:25:10,270 --> 01:25:15,270
I recently heard though about how it can
be a migraine care and that makes sense.

1807
01:25:16,270 --> 01:25:20,830
Thirty nine tiny injections in different
places in your head and it helps with

1808
01:25:20,831 --> 01:25:22,480
migraines.
That kind of makes sense.

1809
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:26,500
If migraines or pressure and pressure is
caused by tension released those

1810
01:25:26,501 --> 01:25:27,490
tension.
So what?

1811
01:25:27,491 --> 01:25:31,120
What do people do when they put it in
their arms or why people don't want the

1812
01:25:31,121 --> 01:25:33,010
way their elbows looking shit.
Oh,

1813
01:25:33,011 --> 01:25:34,390
that's different jamie.
That's.

1814
01:25:35,070 --> 01:25:35,681
Yeah,
that's all.

1815
01:25:35,681 --> 01:25:38,800
We'll see what that guy that's.
Those are not real muscles.

1816
01:25:39,130 --> 01:25:44,130
That's something called we're looking.
We're looking at a video or an image of

1817
01:25:45,191 --> 01:25:50,191
a guy who's on something called Synthol
and Synthol is something that people who

1818
01:25:50,231 --> 01:25:54,190
were into bodybuilding do where they
inject it into their muscles and it's

1819
01:25:54,220 --> 01:25:57,010
oil that inflates the size of the
muscle,

1820
01:25:57,310 --> 01:25:59,050
doesn't change the strength of the
muscle,

1821
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:02,750
but it makes your muscles like blow up
and look completely.

1822
01:26:02,770 --> 01:26:03,990
That guy with the red tee shirt.
I'll

1823
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:05,960
look at these guys like,
look at this.

1824
01:26:07,070 --> 01:26:09,980
They've.
They inject their muscles and make them

1825
01:26:10,130 --> 01:26:14,600
fucking enormous and not just a little
bigger way bigger than normal.

1826
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:17,320
Like it's madness.
Okay.

1827
01:26:17,450 --> 01:26:20,000
Well it doesn't look real at all.
It's crazy,

1828
01:26:20,210 --> 01:26:25,010
but it's a form of body dysmorphia where
these guys think it looks good.

1829
01:26:25,450 --> 01:26:29,360
You know?
It's like when a girl gets size 78,

1830
01:26:29,361 --> 01:26:31,880
double e tents,
they get crazy.

1831
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,310
They just start,
start thinking that that's the way to go

1832
01:26:34,640 --> 01:26:37,490
and it never looks big enough for them
and they just want to get bigger and

1833
01:26:37,491 --> 01:26:42,320
bigger and bigger and it's like
anorexics bodybuilders body dysmorphia

1834
01:26:42,321 --> 01:26:43,310
is a real thing.
It's like,

1835
01:26:43,311 --> 01:26:45,230
well you were saying like looking at
your own known and she's like,

1836
01:26:45,290 --> 01:26:49,520
I just changed this and do something
with it and just start finding.

1837
01:26:49,521 --> 01:26:51,980
You stare at it long enough.
You start finding things you don't like

1838
01:26:51,981 --> 01:26:52,814
about it.
You start,

1839
01:26:53,030 --> 01:26:56,360
you just go through the looking glass
and he gets everything gets distorted.

1840
01:26:56,430 --> 01:27:00,660
Hi kind of thing almost.
I've,

1841
01:27:00,710 --> 01:27:02,760
I,
it really seems that almost all women

1842
01:27:02,761 --> 01:27:04,530
have a certain amount of body
dysmorphia.

1843
01:27:04,620 --> 01:27:07,950
I know I certainly do,
especially having been pretty overweight

1844
01:27:07,951 --> 01:27:09,960
and then now whatever I am and then,
you know,

1845
01:27:09,961 --> 01:27:12,480
it's like I don't,
I don't know how to regard myself in the

1846
01:27:12,481 --> 01:27:14,730
mirror and by the way,
I don't need anyone to tell me how to

1847
01:27:14,731 --> 01:27:17,150
regard myself unless it's positive.
Well,

1848
01:27:17,170 --> 01:27:19,230
yeah.
Yeah.

1849
01:27:19,790 --> 01:27:21,660
Well I just realized I was sort of
inviting,

1850
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:24,960
inviting some stuff and I thank you.
But no thank you.

1851
01:27:25,050 --> 01:27:26,460
Um,
but yeah,

1852
01:27:26,470 --> 01:27:31,470
I just,
most women in this culture don't really

1853
01:27:31,891 --> 01:27:32,650
have a sense of what

1854
01:27:32,650 --> 01:27:33,450
they look like.
Well,

1855
01:27:33,450 --> 01:27:36,850
I think there's also an issue with
improvement in general,

1856
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:40,240
whereas you,
I think that that also can be applied to

1857
01:27:40,241 --> 01:27:42,940
people that just get way too rich and
way too successful.

1858
01:27:42,941 --> 01:27:46,180
It can be applied to looking at your own
body,

1859
01:27:46,690 --> 01:27:49,030
looking at your mind,
looking at your face,

1860
01:27:49,570 --> 01:27:51,070
your face in particular.
Like there's,

1861
01:27:51,190 --> 01:27:53,710
you can,
you can improve the way you look,

1862
01:27:53,711 --> 01:27:55,390
right?
You can wear makeup,

1863
01:27:55,630 --> 01:27:59,560
you can change your hairstyle and when,
when you can do something you're always

1864
01:27:59,561 --> 01:28:01,690
never sure when you're done.
Yeah,

1865
01:28:01,820 --> 01:28:04,450
so like if you're making a painting,
how hard is it to make a painting and

1866
01:28:04,451 --> 01:28:05,490
walk away like,
okay,

1867
01:28:05,830 --> 01:28:06,581
that's good.
No,

1868
01:28:06,581 --> 01:28:11,581
I'm just going a little more and this
process of improvement,

1869
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:16,920
you can get caught up in it where you
lose your objectivity and you can't see

1870
01:28:17,441 --> 01:28:22,300
it the way other people can see it and I
think that is a big part of what body

1871
01:28:22,301 --> 01:28:23,380
dysmorphia is.

1872
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:25,610
You just factionism yeah,
you,

1873
01:28:25,660 --> 01:28:26,240
you,
we,

1874
01:28:26,240 --> 01:28:28,390
we have this desire to improve things,
right?

1875
01:28:28,391 --> 01:28:32,200
You have design.
I think I'm going to renovate my house.

1876
01:28:32,201 --> 01:28:34,300
The next thing you know,
you're going fucking crazy and tearing

1877
01:28:34,301 --> 01:28:37,110
walls down and rewiring things and like,
what?

1878
01:28:37,111 --> 01:28:38,080
What is that?
Well,

1879
01:28:38,081 --> 01:28:40,840
what are you doing right now?
It's like this thing where you can't

1880
01:28:40,841 --> 01:28:43,840
just appreciate,
you have to like constantly change

1881
01:28:43,841 --> 01:28:48,130
things and if,
if that's applied to your face,

1882
01:28:48,550 --> 01:28:51,550
you know,
or your waste with the waste training

1883
01:28:51,551 --> 01:28:53,830
that you're about to get into that where
they were,

1884
01:28:53,831 --> 01:28:58,831
those corsets and soc themselves in and
compress their organs and also hinder

1885
01:28:58,901 --> 01:29:00,460
organ function.
You know,

1886
01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:02,150
it can fuck with the way your,
because you're not.

1887
01:29:02,470 --> 01:29:06,720
Everything is not fucking jammed in
light that you can change the shape of

1888
01:29:06,721 --> 01:29:08,220
your organs.
You know,

1889
01:29:08,230 --> 01:29:11,280
it's this soft tissue.
Have you wear a corset enough?

1890
01:29:11,690 --> 01:29:14,290
I saw a guy with the course of the other
day where,

1891
01:29:14,700 --> 01:29:15,960
well,
I'm assuming he was a guy because he had

1892
01:29:15,961 --> 01:29:18,000
a beard,
but in this day and age and not allowed

1893
01:29:18,001 --> 01:29:19,590
to assume that anymore,
uh,

1894
01:29:19,770 --> 01:29:23,940
he was at universal universal citywalk
or a city park,

1895
01:29:23,941 --> 01:29:24,890
you know,
the fucking,

1896
01:29:25,350 --> 01:29:30,350
the rides and he had a pink corset on
and birkenstocks.

1897
01:29:31,180 --> 01:29:32,460
It was,
it was a dude

1898
01:29:32,770 --> 01:29:35,530
such mixed messages because the
birkenstocks are like,

1899
01:29:35,650 --> 01:29:37,900
I'm going to just be comfortable.
The course that's like,

1900
01:29:37,960 --> 01:29:38,800
no,
no,

1901
01:29:38,801 --> 01:29:39,460
I'm not.

1902
01:29:39,460 --> 01:29:42,160
I think his message was this is how he
likes to dress,

1903
01:29:42,690 --> 01:29:45,010
you know,
but it was a pink corset and it was

1904
01:29:45,011 --> 01:29:47,230
stuffed into this thing and then he had
like,

1905
01:29:47,250 --> 01:29:50,920
you know,
wacky hair and a beard and like kind of

1906
01:29:50,921 --> 01:29:53,080
women.
He close kind of some,

1907
01:29:53,110 --> 01:29:56,060
some parts of the clothing he was
wearing were women's law.

1908
01:29:56,640 --> 01:29:57,530
Yeah.
That the,

1909
01:29:57,531 --> 01:30:01,240
the shirt as well as a woman's shirt was
very odd.

1910
01:30:01,310 --> 01:30:03,640
Just sounds like an uncomfortable
ensemble.

1911
01:30:04,630 --> 01:30:05,980
I don't know what kind of childhood he
had,

1912
01:30:06,010 --> 01:30:08,530
but maybe he's just going to fight that
to the day he dies,

1913
01:30:09,070 --> 01:30:12,610
you know?
I don't know or maybe that I don't

1914
01:30:13,060 --> 01:30:15,190
understand what some people like I
don't,

1915
01:30:15,270 --> 01:30:18,400
I don't like some things that other
people like I don't know what's going on

1916
01:30:18,401 --> 01:30:20,080
in their head where they look at
something and they go,

1917
01:30:20,090 --> 01:30:22,090
that looks amazing,
you know,

1918
01:30:22,100 --> 01:30:24,760
like,
but some people that is what they like,

1919
01:30:24,790 --> 01:30:29,050
you know,
for him maybe it's that like people that

1920
01:30:29,051 --> 01:30:31,700
like to dress up like furries.
Right?

1921
01:30:31,750 --> 01:30:32,583
Like what?
What is,

1922
01:30:32,980 --> 01:30:37,980
what is it about putting on a fucking
giant mascot outfit of a squirrel that

1923
01:30:39,011 --> 01:30:40,740
really gets your rocks off?
I don't know.

1924
01:30:40,940 --> 01:30:41,820
I know,
I don't know.

1925
01:30:41,821 --> 01:30:45,430
I don't get it,
but I don't think I have to know.

1926
01:30:46,300 --> 01:30:47,970
You don't have to.
No,

1927
01:30:47,971 --> 01:30:48,760
I don't.
I don't.

1928
01:30:48,760 --> 01:30:52,780
In terms of things like fetishes,
I don't know that someone can

1929
01:30:54,760 --> 01:30:57,190
understand the mindset of someone who's
into that.

1930
01:30:57,220 --> 01:31:01,620
You know?
I feel like that is so baked into your,

1931
01:31:02,100 --> 01:31:05,350
your like operating software to use that
term again.

1932
01:31:05,380 --> 01:31:07,780
That it's like I don't,
I don't know that that's.

1933
01:31:07,990 --> 01:31:09,940
If I were to explain it,
someone else would get it.

1934
01:31:09,941 --> 01:31:12,340
I don't think that's like that.
I think that's more like,

1935
01:31:12,460 --> 01:31:14,860
I like the smell of vanilla or I don't
like the smell,

1936
01:31:15,110 --> 01:31:16,480
right?
It turns my stomach

1937
01:31:16,860 --> 01:31:18,320
well.
It's weird when you find out that some

1938
01:31:18,321 --> 01:31:22,550
fetishes or just sort of burned into
your mind at a very young age when

1939
01:31:22,551 --> 01:31:26,060
you're sexually maturing.
Like Dr Chris Ryan was a friend of mine

1940
01:31:26,061 --> 01:31:29,690
has been on the podcast before he was
talking to me about,

1941
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:31,940
um,
children,

1942
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:35,960
especially boys when they're in a
certain level of puberty,

1943
01:31:36,210 --> 01:31:41,210
I think it's age is between 11 and 14.
Any sort of sexual encounters that they

1944
01:31:42,111 --> 01:31:46,910
have during those age can almost
permanently burn those,

1945
01:31:47,030 --> 01:31:47,863
those,
uh,

1946
01:31:47,870 --> 01:31:52,870
encounters into their category of sexual
attractive things.

1947
01:31:53,180 --> 01:31:54,470
Things that they find sexually
attractive,

1948
01:31:54,471 --> 01:31:58,370
including like sex with men.
And he was talking about how men can be

1949
01:31:58,371 --> 01:32:00,280
totally straight,
but maybe

1950
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:03,040
they got blown by some guy when they
were 14,

1951
01:32:03,060 --> 01:32:05,110
like in some crazy,
weird moment.

1952
01:32:05,111 --> 01:32:10,111
And then they become attracted to men,
billowing them for like forever.

1953
01:32:10,390 --> 01:32:12,790
It becomes like a weird fetish.
Yeah.

1954
01:32:12,791 --> 01:32:13,130
Well,
yeah,

1955
01:32:13,130 --> 01:32:14,680
it's,
it's imprinted.

1956
01:32:14,710 --> 01:32:16,210
I forget the term he used

1957
01:32:16,510 --> 01:32:19,480
suggesting that therefore then they're
gay or they're not gay.

1958
01:32:19,481 --> 01:32:21,310
They just are introduced blowing them.

1959
01:32:21,540 --> 01:32:23,520
Exactly.
That's what he's suggesting.

1960
01:32:23,521 --> 01:32:25,140
I mean,
I'm sure there's all sorts of,

1961
01:32:25,780 --> 01:32:28,560
there's both,
but I think what he's saying is that

1962
01:32:28,620 --> 01:32:33,620
some men can be even attracted to gay
porn are attracted the idea of guys

1963
01:32:34,051 --> 01:32:36,260
blowing guys and not be gay,
which is,

1964
01:32:36,740 --> 01:32:37,573
you know,
we,

1965
01:32:37,890 --> 01:32:40,650
we don't like to.
We would like to make things very clean

1966
01:32:40,651 --> 01:32:43,680
the way we categorize things.
You'd like to have like very clean and

1967
01:32:43,740 --> 01:32:44,820
obvious categories.

1968
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,250
Right.
But if we're all on a spectrum than the

1969
01:32:47,251 --> 01:32:49,560
categories breakdown for different
people.

1970
01:32:49,561 --> 01:32:51,210
Yeah.
Yeah.

1971
01:32:51,240 --> 01:32:54,030
I forget what term he used about this
imprinting,

1972
01:32:54,420 --> 01:32:55,260
but.
And I.

1973
01:32:55,260 --> 01:32:55,500
Sorry,
go ahead.

1974
01:32:55,500 --> 01:32:56,040
No,
that's great.

1975
01:32:56,040 --> 01:33:00,750
I think that younger people are much
more comfortable with the fluidity of

1976
01:33:00,751 --> 01:33:02,910
sexuality and with everything.
I mean,

1977
01:33:02,911 --> 01:33:07,911
I remember when I was in college,
there were,

1978
01:33:08,020 --> 01:33:11,530
there was a fair amount of girls making
out with girls,

1979
01:33:11,710 --> 01:33:13,840
but in front of guys like,
look at me.

1980
01:33:13,841 --> 01:33:15,730
I'm so wild and making out with a girl
but not,

1981
01:33:15,731 --> 01:33:18,040
you know.
And I feel like that's now,

1982
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:20,320
you know what I'd actually don't know.
I was gonna say.

1983
01:33:20,321 --> 01:33:21,610
I feel like that happens all the time
now,

1984
01:33:21,611 --> 01:33:23,470
but I just,
I sound like a blue hair or something.

1985
01:33:23,471 --> 01:33:25,540
I don't actually know.
I think people

1986
01:33:25,660 --> 01:33:30,660
are experimenting with the idea of doing
things that are outside of the confines

1987
01:33:32,201 --> 01:33:36,670
of normal patterns and because they
don't like who their parents are and

1988
01:33:36,671 --> 01:33:39,740
they don't want to be like them,
so they want to be able to rebel.

1989
01:33:39,750 --> 01:33:44,750
One of the best ways to rebel is to
exhibit behaviors or indulge in

1990
01:33:45,101 --> 01:33:48,370
behaviors that are forbidden or they're
outside of patterns.

1991
01:33:48,430 --> 01:33:50,320
Right.
Who is this girl at the comedy store?

1992
01:33:50,321 --> 01:33:54,100
One of the waitresses was telling me
about her friend who it was.

1993
01:33:54,130 --> 01:33:58,060
She said it was like hilarious the way
set it because he said,

1994
01:33:58,510 --> 01:34:02,830
I know I'm not gay because I've had sex
with guys and I didn't like it.

1995
01:34:03,940 --> 01:34:05,650
And she said,
I think that's one of the most

1996
01:34:05,651 --> 01:34:07,540
heterosexual things that a guy could
say.

1997
01:34:07,541 --> 01:34:09,520
And we were laughing.
I guess so.

1998
01:34:09,521 --> 01:34:10,600
Right.
I'm like,

1999
01:34:10,601 --> 01:34:14,140
you don't really know if you like
sucking Dick and team suck a dick.

2000
01:34:14,300 --> 01:34:15,700
And that's what he was saying.
He's like,

2001
01:34:15,701 --> 01:34:18,370
I didn't know it goes.
I had sex with a guy,

2002
01:34:18,371 --> 01:34:20,800
I blew them,
I didn't like it at all and I'm never

2003
01:34:20,801 --> 01:34:21,634
doing it again,

2004
01:34:23,340 --> 01:34:28,340
and she was talking about his commitment
to finding out,

2005
01:34:29,420 --> 01:34:34,420
to not prejudging by think that people
did that in the seventies in particular,

2006
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:40,290
there was a bunch of rock stars that
experimented with gay sex like Pete

2007
01:34:40,291 --> 01:34:44,890
towns and did it and Mick Jagger and
David Bowie supposedly did it like,

2008
01:34:44,910 --> 01:34:49,910
I think it was common that people were
experimenting with boundaries and they

2009
01:34:51,031 --> 01:34:53,520
were challenging where those boundaries
are,

2010
01:34:53,521 --> 01:34:58,070
where they begin and where they end.
And we also know that like homosexuality

2011
01:34:58,071 --> 01:35:01,580
in particular was very,
very common a long time ago.

2012
01:35:02,090 --> 01:35:04,790
You know,
even pet history,

2013
01:35:05,060 --> 01:35:06,370
you know,
that's word right.

2014
01:35:06,850 --> 01:35:08,270
Passed Pettis history,
isn't it?

2015
01:35:09,830 --> 01:35:10,720
Fucking kids.
Yeah.

2016
01:35:10,770 --> 01:35:12,170
Fucking kids.
Yeah.

2017
01:35:12,230 --> 01:35:15,170
Being a pet,
harassed they.

2018
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:17,450
That was super common,
was it?

2019
01:35:17,610 --> 01:35:19,850
Yeah.
Maybe somewhere and it's.

2020
01:35:19,940 --> 01:35:21,650
We're so close to the.
Yes.

2021
01:35:21,710 --> 01:35:23,770
Yeah.
The word pedophiles does.

2022
01:35:24,110 --> 01:35:26,150
There's a difference between being a or
a pederastic pedophile.

2023
01:35:26,180 --> 01:35:28,490
One of them is like they get attracted
to it.

2024
01:35:28,491 --> 01:35:30,620
One of them is they engage in it.
Interesting.

2025
01:35:31,220 --> 01:35:35,150
But it was super common,
like really common amongst like really

2026
01:35:35,151 --> 01:35:38,900
respected people like socrates,
Plato.

2027
01:35:38,990 --> 01:35:43,240
There's a lot of people that were the,
they acknowledged that they had young

2028
01:35:43,250 --> 01:35:46,670
boyfriends,
like little tiny young people.

2029
01:35:47,150 --> 01:35:50,570
It's fucked.
But back then it wasn't fucked and

2030
01:35:50,720 --> 01:35:54,620
homosexuality through.
I mean the Greeks and the Romans and

2031
01:35:54,621 --> 01:35:57,880
they'd be constantly engaged in
homosexual behavior.

2032
01:35:58,280 --> 01:36:02,870
That's weird about like depictions of
them in modern media.

2033
01:36:02,871 --> 01:36:05,330
They don't,
they don't indulge in that like that's

2034
01:36:05,331 --> 01:36:08,690
like not a part of like the movie 300,
you know what I mean?

2035
01:36:09,160 --> 01:36:13,430
Punch dudes but fucking each other.
But if we're led to

2036
01:36:15,100 --> 01:36:20,100
believe
I've gone over the texts,

2037
01:36:21,710 --> 01:36:25,390
it seems like we're not,
we're not showing an ample amount of bud

2038
01:36:25,391 --> 01:36:26,810
fucking amongst students.

2039
01:36:26,970 --> 01:36:30,240
Interesting.
Is that it could have been so accepted

2040
01:36:30,750 --> 01:36:35,610
and then there could have been such a
change where up until recently,

2041
01:36:35,611 --> 01:36:39,750
it's like people who were truly gay did
not feel comfortable being gay.

2042
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:41,610
You know,
that it could change that much.

2043
01:36:41,910 --> 01:36:43,700
I wonder if it's cultural.
You know,

2044
01:36:43,720 --> 01:36:44,960
I don't,
I don't know Jen.

2045
01:36:45,340 --> 01:36:46,950
It could be religion,
but it's also.

2046
01:36:47,220 --> 01:36:50,520
It could very well be.
What did you grow up with?

2047
01:36:51,060 --> 01:36:54,570
Like I think a lot of what people are is
what did you grow up with?

2048
01:36:54,960 --> 01:36:56,580
If you look at the variations,
you know,

2049
01:36:56,581 --> 01:36:59,730
you talk about the spectrum cultural
behaviors that exist in human beings.

2050
01:37:00,030 --> 01:37:05,030
There is a wide and varied and in some
places extremely bizarre and so you look

2051
01:37:06,331 --> 01:37:10,590
at like isolated tribes in particular
and you look at some of their strange

2052
01:37:10,620 --> 01:37:13,470
practices,
like there's this group in New Guinea

2053
01:37:13,770 --> 01:37:15,000
and a,
this,

2054
01:37:15,090 --> 01:37:18,570
they call them the semen warriors of New
Guinea and they,

2055
01:37:18,630 --> 01:37:22,080
one of the things they do is they take
young boys away from their mothers very

2056
01:37:22,081 --> 01:37:24,990
early on.
They live in these bachelor groups and

2057
01:37:25,020 --> 01:37:27,610
it's all just child rape.
Yeah,

2058
01:37:27,960 --> 01:37:28,710
yeah.
I mean,

2059
01:37:28,710 --> 01:37:33,210
and they think that the only way a young
boy can grow up and develop his.

2060
01:37:33,211 --> 01:37:36,180
If he ingest semen,
yeah,

2061
01:37:36,181 --> 01:37:39,870
it's fucking crazy.
And this has been going on for thousands

2062
01:37:39,870 --> 01:37:42,390
of years.
Apparently this isolated tribe that does

2063
01:37:42,391 --> 01:37:47,391
this and these are like fierce warriors
who fucking kill their enemies and eat

2064
01:37:47,731 --> 01:37:49,070
them and shit.
A lot of,

2065
01:37:49,090 --> 01:37:51,840
a lot of cannibalism exists in some
isolated tribes,

2066
01:37:51,870 --> 01:37:54,150
especially around New Guinea for some
strange reason,

2067
01:37:54,600 --> 01:37:55,980
but what

2068
01:37:55,980 --> 01:37:59,880
I would think would be fascinating would
be talking to the person who escaped

2069
01:37:59,881 --> 01:38:01,710
that.
If assuming there are,

2070
01:38:01,711 --> 01:38:05,780
I mean they must.
The tribes must shed members ever

2071
01:38:05,790 --> 01:38:07,830
occasionally.
And then which way did they go and what

2072
01:38:07,831 --> 01:38:08,664
do they do?

2073
01:38:09,040 --> 01:38:09,730
Well,
I mean,

2074
01:38:09,730 --> 01:38:13,630
in a lot of ways it's a cult behavior.
Like can I have a friend who used to be

2075
01:38:13,631 --> 01:38:17,770
in the moonies?
I know a dude who grew up a Mooney.

2076
01:38:17,771 --> 01:38:20,380
I know.
Do grew up a Christian scientist or

2077
01:38:20,381 --> 01:38:21,670
Jehovah witness.
I know a couple.

2078
01:38:21,680 --> 01:38:22,220
Jehovah's Witness.

2079
01:38:22,220 --> 01:38:24,040
That's me too.
Former Jehovah's Witnesses.

2080
01:38:24,050 --> 01:38:25,270
See,
that's weird man.

2081
01:38:25,330 --> 01:38:28,400
That's a weird one.
And that my friends who are Jehovah's

2082
01:38:28,401 --> 01:38:29,470
Witnesses who are.
No,

2083
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:34,040
they are no longer practicing but their
families still are o g and that creates

2084
01:38:34,041 --> 01:38:36,650
all sorts of problems like my friend,
um,

2085
01:38:37,220 --> 01:38:41,030
who,
her mom didn't come to her wedding

2086
01:38:41,960 --> 01:38:46,340
because I forget because what,
something about her wedding wasn't

2087
01:38:46,760 --> 01:38:50,020
Jehovah's Witness approved.
So she,

2088
01:38:50,070 --> 01:38:51,980
her mom couldn't go.
Jesus Christ.

2089
01:38:52,490 --> 01:38:54,290
Yeah.
How specific mom.

2090
01:38:55,490 --> 01:38:56,400
Yeah.
Alright.

2091
01:38:56,450 --> 01:38:58,850
I have a Joe Rogan question.
I have noticed,

2092
01:39:00,230 --> 01:39:05,090
I have noticed that you posted a lot of
images that show the brutality of

2093
01:39:05,091 --> 01:39:07,210
nature.
Um,

2094
01:39:07,580 --> 01:39:11,510
and I'm wondering what about that aspect
of nature appeals?

2095
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:13,410
Well,
it's not even just the brutality of

2096
01:39:13,411 --> 01:39:14,660
nature,
just nature in general,

2097
01:39:14,661 --> 01:39:17,160
like those photos that I have over there
that,

2098
01:39:17,360 --> 01:39:20,490
um,
what's joke named Cj cjm photography,

2099
01:39:20,760 --> 01:39:25,760
cjm underscore photography sent us.
Those are these wolves in yellowstone.

2100
01:39:26,101 --> 01:39:29,790
I just think I just am fascinated by
wildlife,

2101
01:39:30,120 --> 01:39:32,130
like see those walls and they're
incredible.

2102
01:39:32,370 --> 01:39:33,330
They're amazing,
right?

2103
01:39:33,410 --> 01:39:34,980
Yeah.
There's,

2104
01:39:34,981 --> 01:39:36,780
um,
there's the actual photo itself.

2105
01:39:36,930 --> 01:39:41,550
I'm just really,
really fascinated by wildlife and for

2106
01:39:41,551 --> 01:39:46,080
whatever reason wild predators fascinate
me more because they're scary and just

2107
01:39:46,081 --> 01:39:51,081
because the way they live is so it's so
explosive and dynamic and final,

2108
01:39:54,890 --> 01:39:57,900
you know,
like when the image of the bear that I

2109
01:39:57,901 --> 01:40:01,400
posted the other day that was eating the
sheep and pulling those fields shape

2110
01:40:01,710 --> 01:40:06,710
that it followed from a was killed the
sheep and that was pulling the fetus out

2111
01:40:06,811 --> 01:40:10,260
of its body.
It's like that is just so ruthless and

2112
01:40:10,950 --> 01:40:11,783
brutal.

2113
01:40:11,880 --> 01:40:15,260
There's something about that aspect of,
um,

2114
01:40:15,330 --> 01:40:18,450
of nature that's just insanely,
uh,

2115
01:40:18,840 --> 01:40:20,490
when I,
when I say attractive,

2116
01:40:20,491 --> 01:40:22,020
I don't mean I love it.
Like I'm like,

2117
01:40:22,080 --> 01:40:23,400
yeah,
eat it up,

2118
01:40:23,401 --> 01:40:25,110
eat it up.
I'm excited by it.

2119
01:40:25,590 --> 01:40:28,620
I mean I'm,
I'm drawn to it and compelled to view it

2120
01:40:28,621 --> 01:40:33,621
and fascinated by the fact that these
animals exist with us on this planet

2121
01:40:35,641 --> 01:40:40,641
alongside us right now in the wild.
And it's one of the more amazing aspects

2122
01:40:41,131 --> 01:40:46,131
about North America is that North
America has these wildlife preserves,

2123
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:52,800
these places like yellowstone,
these state and national parks where

2124
01:40:52,890 --> 01:40:57,890
they have these animals that are
wandering around and any given time you

2125
01:40:58,991 --> 01:41:02,970
can go to yellowstone and you could see
bison and woves and,

2126
01:41:03,260 --> 01:41:05,350
and bear and they don't.
I mean,

2127
01:41:05,351 --> 01:41:07,540
whether you're there or whether you're
not there,

2128
01:41:07,541 --> 01:41:10,240
that is how they live.
They live in the same way.

2129
01:41:10,241 --> 01:41:14,710
They've lived for millions of years and
this really barbaric raw,

2130
01:41:14,711 --> 01:41:19,450
natural world where it's just about
breeding and killing and trying to keep

2131
01:41:19,451 --> 01:41:22,660
the numbers as high as possible while,
you know,

2132
01:41:23,170 --> 01:41:28,090
riding it out until the Alpha male gets
too old to defend its territory.

2133
01:41:28,091 --> 01:41:31,000
And then gets forced out and eventually
dies and freezes to death.

2134
01:41:31,001 --> 01:41:34,300
I mean,
and it's this intense long running

2135
01:41:34,301 --> 01:41:36,700
cycle.
I'm just really,

2136
01:41:36,701 --> 01:41:39,130
really fascinated by wildlife in
general.

2137
01:41:39,920 --> 01:41:44,920
Do you think that,
because I wondered if there's an element

2138
01:41:47,931 --> 01:41:52,931
of it that you feel like people don't
face that that's our true nature to a

2139
01:41:54,141 --> 01:41:56,380
degree and like what we come from.
Cause I,

2140
01:41:56,450 --> 01:41:58,490
you know,
I can post nature images and it can be

2141
01:41:58,491 --> 01:42:01,070
like look at these puppies will get a
puppy per friending a duckling.

2142
01:42:01,130 --> 01:42:03,650
That's what I post.
I'm really nature though.

2143
01:42:04,390 --> 01:42:06,110
Well natural images.
I'm saying like,

2144
01:42:06,111 --> 01:42:06,944
you know,
there's,

2145
01:42:07,400 --> 01:42:10,970
people often don't focus on the stuff
that you're presenting.

2146
01:42:10,971 --> 01:42:11,691
It's like,
you know,

2147
01:42:11,691 --> 01:42:12,524
it's there,
but it's like,

2148
01:42:12,530 --> 01:42:15,770
I don't want to think about that.
It's icky and it makes me uncomfortable.

2149
01:42:16,430 --> 01:42:18,380
Do you,
do you delight?

2150
01:42:19,460 --> 01:42:23,840
Is there a part of you that wishes
people would recognize that that is a

2151
01:42:23,841 --> 01:42:24,674
reality more?

2152
01:42:24,850 --> 01:42:25,780
No,
I mean,

2153
01:42:25,781 --> 01:42:28,120
yes for sure.
But that's not why I'm putting it up.

2154
01:42:28,121 --> 01:42:29,980
I'm putting it up just because it's
compelling to me,

2155
01:42:30,330 --> 01:42:31,000
you know?
And I just,

2156
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:32,530
when I see things that are cool,
I'm just like,

2157
01:42:32,531 --> 01:42:34,510
look at this fucking war,
this is wild.

2158
01:42:34,540 --> 01:42:36,490
Looking at that and I feel compelled to
put it up.

2159
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:41,620
But I think our life,
the way we live in cities and in urban

2160
01:42:41,621 --> 01:42:46,470
areas is,
is insanely filtered in terms of like

2161
01:42:46,480 --> 01:42:49,000
our interactions with the rest of the
world,

2162
01:42:49,270 --> 01:42:53,620
especially when we're consuming things
that come from the outside and then it

2163
01:42:53,621 --> 01:42:58,621
comes not just as far as animals but
even plant life.

2164
01:42:59,470 --> 01:43:03,060
Even just just gardens in nature.
We're.

2165
01:43:03,061 --> 01:43:05,410
But we,
I think we buy too much vegetables from

2166
01:43:05,411 --> 01:43:09,130
the store.
We buy too many vegetables from a box

2167
01:43:09,340 --> 01:43:14,340
from a shelf and we stick it in a
plastic bag and we drive it away.

2168
01:43:14,410 --> 01:43:17,860
I think we would all to ourselves a lot
of good if we grew some.

2169
01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:23,560
We kind of understood this process.
Like I grow vegetables and I put them in

2170
01:43:23,921 --> 01:43:26,830
a salad and I chopped them up and cook
them and eat them.

2171
01:43:26,831 --> 01:43:30,760
And there's something incredibly
satisfying about being there for the

2172
01:43:30,761 --> 01:43:33,940
entire process.
Knowing that this is a seed I put in the

2173
01:43:33,941 --> 01:43:36,400
dirt,
I put the fertilizer up at the water and

2174
01:43:36,401 --> 01:43:41,401
here it is in a salad and there's a
connection to your food and to this the

2175
01:43:42,671 --> 01:43:47,671
life form that you're consuming itself
in that way that I don't think you get

2176
01:43:48,670 --> 01:43:52,850
any other way and I think I think that
the filter that we've created by

2177
01:43:53,060 --> 01:43:55,850
civilization,
by supermarkets,

2178
01:43:55,851 --> 01:43:59,180
by restaurants and things like that,
I think it's unhealthy because I think

2179
01:43:59,181 --> 01:44:04,010
it keeps us from a true complete
understanding of our position in this

2180
01:44:04,011 --> 01:44:06,080
whole thing that that bear.

2181
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:10,760
The only difference between that bear in
the space that you're in right now is

2182
01:44:10,761 --> 01:44:14,060
just distance like that.
Bear could be right over there.

2183
01:44:14,450 --> 01:44:16,400
I mean it's wandering around on the
earth.

2184
01:44:16,401 --> 01:44:18,920
It doesn't have fences around it.
It's just distance.

2185
01:44:18,921 --> 01:44:22,820
That keeps it from being in Woodland
Hills walking down the street.

2186
01:44:23,090 --> 01:44:25,940
That's really all that stops it.
It's terrifying.

2187
01:44:25,970 --> 01:44:27,530
Yeah.
It's got its own environment.

2188
01:44:27,531 --> 01:44:31,670
It's got its own range and so it stays
in that range and eat the animals that

2189
01:44:31,671 --> 01:44:33,770
are in that range,
but not even just terrifying.

2190
01:44:33,771 --> 01:44:38,771
Just the idea that that is a life form
that coexist with us and our life form.

2191
01:44:39,290 --> 01:44:44,290
We have figured out a way to isolate it
in these very strange tribal systems in

2192
01:44:44,961 --> 01:44:47,890
these communities and civilizations and
cities.

2193
01:44:48,430 --> 01:44:53,430
It's very bizarre and so that's the most
appealing thing about wildlife and wild

2194
01:44:53,691 --> 01:44:55,250
predators,
especially predators because that's what

2195
01:44:55,251 --> 01:45:00,251
we're afraid of the most were afraid of
being consumed by one of these things

2196
01:45:00,351 --> 01:45:02,900
that just consumes their consuming
machines.

2197
01:45:02,900 --> 01:45:07,190
They're just walking through the woods
looking for something to consume and

2198
01:45:07,191 --> 01:45:09,200
that's what they do.
They try to fuck and they try to kill

2199
01:45:09,201 --> 01:45:14,201
things to eat them and it's so bizarre
that that's all going on right now

2200
01:45:14,331 --> 01:45:18,050
constantly all the time,
but most of our interactions with

2201
01:45:18,051 --> 01:45:21,410
animals or puppies,
dogs or cat,

2202
01:45:21,411 --> 01:45:22,940
hey sweetie,
here's a can of food,

2203
01:45:23,250 --> 01:45:26,120
open the Canada and the thing about
ground up fucking chickens and got

2204
01:45:26,121 --> 01:45:27,170
stuffed in.
That can.

2205
01:45:27,590 --> 01:45:30,080
We're weird.
We're weird and I think we're

2206
01:45:30,081 --> 01:45:31,850
disconnected.
One hundred percent.

2207
01:45:32,030 --> 01:45:33,210
Yeah,
but I.

2208
01:45:33,290 --> 01:45:35,390
But I'm,
I'm engrossed in it.

2209
01:45:35,480 --> 01:45:40,340
I'm just constantly watching nature
documentaries and paying attention to

2210
01:45:40,341 --> 01:45:42,950
articles about it and I'm fascinated by
it.

2211
01:45:43,480 --> 01:45:48,480
Are you interested in desensitizing
yourself to horrific images?

2212
01:45:50,511 --> 01:45:52,000
Like I've had people on my podcast
before.

2213
01:45:52,001 --> 01:45:57,001
It's usually people who came up in tech
who went through a phase where they felt

2214
01:45:57,431 --> 01:46:00,760
the need to watch beheading videos.
Unlike anything anyone would send them,

2215
01:46:00,761 --> 01:46:03,520
they felt the need to watch it so that
they could handle it.

2216
01:46:04,850 --> 01:46:07,970
This is a thought process that I can
understand.

2217
01:46:08,210 --> 01:46:10,940
I get why somebody,
if something really bothers them,

2218
01:46:10,941 --> 01:46:13,520
they would want to see it a lot and then
if that does happen,

2219
01:46:13,780 --> 01:46:16,070
how you see things enough,
you can get desensitized.

2220
01:46:16,760 --> 01:46:20,570
I think it's a really negative feeling
to watch like a reporter get his head

2221
01:46:20,571 --> 01:46:22,220
cut off by the Taliban or something like
that.

2222
01:46:22,221 --> 01:46:24,200
It's a really negative feeling that I
don't want.

2223
01:46:24,540 --> 01:46:28,250
I remember I watched this isis video,
one of the last ones that I watched of

2224
01:46:28,251 --> 01:46:32,120
these guys shooting these guys.
They had them debt face down.

2225
01:46:32,130 --> 01:46:34,450
The shot them all and you know,
they're just,

2226
01:46:34,580 --> 01:46:37,640
you see their body's reacting to the
bullets and the climb over this guy and

2227
01:46:37,641 --> 01:46:40,930
they cut his head off and I'm watching
them dig into this guy's neck with this

2228
01:46:40,940 --> 01:46:44,870
knife and pull his head up and yell Ilog
Bar and hold it up.

2229
01:46:44,870 --> 01:46:47,420
And,
and I remember thinking as I'm watching

2230
01:46:47,421 --> 01:46:47,750
that,
like,

2231
01:46:47,750 --> 01:46:48,583
okay,
I get it.

2232
01:46:48,860 --> 01:46:51,180
I it not wanting to use anymore.
I get it.

2233
01:46:51,360 --> 01:46:53,760
I know those guys exist.
I've got it in my database.

2234
01:46:53,820 --> 01:46:57,240
It's there.
I don't need to be feeling like shit all

2235
01:46:57,240 --> 01:46:58,950
day for the rest of the day.
Thinking like,

2236
01:46:58,951 --> 01:47:02,730
how the fuck does everything goes so bad
that someone's making a youtube video

2237
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,820
gunning people down and cutting their
head off with a pocket knife.

2238
01:47:06,180 --> 01:47:09,260
I consider this what,
what,

2239
01:47:09,330 --> 01:47:10,163
what?
I mean,

2240
01:47:10,500 --> 01:47:11,131
we,
you know,

2241
01:47:11,131 --> 01:47:15,330
that that guy lived to be 30 whatever
years old before he shooting this guy

2242
01:47:15,331 --> 01:47:20,070
and cutting this out off like what is
his experiences in his life that led him

2243
01:47:20,430 --> 01:47:24,450
to be at the point where he wants to
project this horrific image to the rest

2244
01:47:24,451 --> 01:47:29,070
of the world to put fear and terror into
the eyes of the beholder.

2245
01:47:29,070 --> 01:47:30,570
It's like,
what is it that he's trying to do?

2246
01:47:30,571 --> 01:47:32,280
Like what?
What has gone wrong?

2247
01:47:32,520 --> 01:47:33,930
What you're trying to say.
And again,

2248
01:47:33,931 --> 01:47:37,980
it's what you were saying about the
spectrum like this in the spectrum,

2249
01:47:37,981 --> 01:47:41,400
there's a horrific behavior is versus
beautiful behaviors.

2250
01:47:41,700 --> 01:47:46,700
There's this broad and I think there's
something to be said for knowing that

2251
01:47:48,391 --> 01:47:53,160
darkness just so that you can understand
like this is also in the mix.

2252
01:47:53,161 --> 01:47:56,550
This is also in the equation.
Don't look for it everywhere because

2253
01:47:56,551 --> 01:48:00,210
it'll fucking freak you out.
But knowing that it's there,

2254
01:48:00,410 --> 01:48:02,750
it's probably better.
It doesn't exist.

2255
01:48:02,770 --> 01:48:03,600
Yeah.
Yeah.

2256
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:05,700
Because I think if you pretend it
doesn't exist,

2257
01:48:05,701 --> 01:48:09,060
that means that you pretend it doesn't
exist in yourself.

2258
01:48:09,130 --> 01:48:11,130
Yeah.
And then all of a sudden you're getting

2259
01:48:11,131 --> 01:48:12,670
drunk and being an asshole.
Yeah.

2260
01:48:12,671 --> 01:48:15,330
A friend of mine sent me an article
about this girl who went over to,

2261
01:48:15,331 --> 01:48:20,070
um,
Syria to try to love her way through the

2262
01:48:20,071 --> 01:48:22,860
country and she was raped and killed
really quickly.

2263
01:48:23,100 --> 01:48:25,000
Um,
and when he,

2264
01:48:25,001 --> 01:48:26,160
uh,
when he sent it to me,

2265
01:48:26,161 --> 01:48:28,820
I remember like reading this article and
thinking like,

2266
01:48:28,830 --> 01:48:30,930
who?
Why would someone be so naive that they

2267
01:48:30,931 --> 01:48:34,260
think they could just go and hug all
these people wanted to this land?

2268
01:48:34,261 --> 01:48:37,680
And then she was gang raped and killed
by these Muslim guys.

2269
01:48:38,190 --> 01:48:43,190
And uh,
just there's a lot of people that don't

2270
01:48:44,101 --> 01:48:49,101
want to believe that some people had a
really shitty upbringing.

2271
01:48:50,280 --> 01:48:53,130
They had a shitty deal.
They were born in a terrible part of the

2272
01:48:53,131 --> 01:48:55,260
world.
They were exposed to horrific things

2273
01:48:55,261 --> 01:48:58,350
very early on in their programming is
ugly.

2274
01:48:58,830 --> 01:49:03,090
It's dark and ugly and filled with
trauma and pain and suffering and

2275
01:49:03,091 --> 01:49:05,100
violence.
And that is who they are.

2276
01:49:05,310 --> 01:49:09,480
But that is a reality.
That's why the people that are total 100

2277
01:49:09,481 --> 01:49:12,180
percent antimilitary good luck with all
that.

2278
01:49:12,750 --> 01:49:16,140
Good luck with it because you're,
what you're saying is you hope for the

2279
01:49:16,141 --> 01:49:18,870
compassion of all these people in the
world to,

2280
01:49:18,871 --> 01:49:20,490
that it matches up with yours.
Well,

2281
01:49:20,491 --> 01:49:22,800
guess what?
It doesn't because there are parts in

2282
01:49:22,801 --> 01:49:27,390
the world where these people are 30
years old and for 30 years they have

2283
01:49:27,391 --> 01:49:30,660
been exposed to horrific violence and
that is what they do.

2284
01:49:31,050 --> 01:49:33,120
And the,
unless they die,

2285
01:49:33,420 --> 01:49:36,000
this is,
this is just how they behave and you are

2286
01:49:36,001 --> 01:49:40,140
going to run into them and most likely
they're going to enact horrific violence

2287
01:49:40,141 --> 01:49:41,670
on people you know,
or on you.

2288
01:49:42,210 --> 01:49:43,650
There's a lot of people like that,
that,

2289
01:49:43,770 --> 01:49:48,250
that exists.
I used to be at a total pacifist growing

2290
01:49:48,250 --> 01:49:49,510
up.
So when I was young,

2291
01:49:49,960 --> 01:49:52,240
um,
and you know,

2292
01:49:52,241 --> 01:49:57,241
now I recognize that that's
unfortunately a beautiful but naive way

2293
01:49:57,491 --> 01:49:59,350
to go through the world because you
just,

2294
01:49:59,590 --> 01:50:01,030
it's just,
it's not a,

2295
01:50:01,720 --> 01:50:05,890
not realistic to have no military and to
think that you never need it because you

2296
01:50:05,891 --> 01:50:06,724
do,
you need,

2297
01:50:06,790 --> 01:50:10,510
you need to be able to show strength and
you need to be able to be protected and

2298
01:50:10,750 --> 01:50:14,590
you need to crush bullshit.
When it happens in different places,

2299
01:50:14,591 --> 01:50:19,540
and I hate that though,
I don't love having to have come to that

2300
01:50:19,541 --> 01:50:21,790
conclusion like I preferred,
I prefer.

2301
01:50:21,791 --> 01:50:25,660
I prefer the idea that you can just hug
people and make a difference.

2302
01:50:25,740 --> 01:50:27,990
That'd be beautiful and it works in
small groups.

2303
01:50:28,040 --> 01:50:31,500
It works in some places,
but look at North Korea,

2304
01:50:31,530 --> 01:50:34,170
you've got a dictatorship.
You got some evil.

2305
01:50:34,171 --> 01:50:38,700
Fuck who's running an entire country and
it keeps people entirely under his

2306
01:50:38,701 --> 01:50:42,360
thumb,
mean literally an entire country under

2307
01:50:42,361 --> 01:50:43,450
this guise thumb.
Yeah.

2308
01:50:43,710 --> 01:50:45,780
Think about what's going on right now in
the Congo.

2309
01:50:45,781 --> 01:50:50,160
Think about what's going on right now,
all throughout the darker aspects of the

2310
01:50:50,161 --> 01:50:54,930
world where people are poor and there's
violence everywhere.

2311
01:50:54,931 --> 01:50:59,370
There's a lot of places in the world
today that are the apocalypse there.

2312
01:50:59,371 --> 01:51:02,340
They're like,
there's this crazy vice piece on

2313
01:51:02,341 --> 01:51:05,400
Liberia.
I don't know if you ever go to vice.

2314
01:51:05,430 --> 01:51:08,850
Do you ever read,
come Jesus Christ have this video on

2315
01:51:09,210 --> 01:51:13,050
Liberia and this guy,
they call him general butt naked because

2316
01:51:13,051 --> 01:51:13,560
he would,
uh,

2317
01:51:13,560 --> 01:51:16,080
he would go into fights naked.
You going to end.

2318
01:51:16,090 --> 01:51:17,490
He was a part of this,
um,

2319
01:51:18,120 --> 01:51:20,940
civil war that was going on in Liberia,
but he was accountable.

2320
01:51:21,030 --> 01:51:23,430
He killed babies from these neighboring
tribes.

2321
01:51:23,431 --> 01:51:27,030
He would go over and kill the children
and eat their heart and they thought

2322
01:51:27,031 --> 01:51:29,400
that like eating a piece of a children's
heart,

2323
01:51:29,670 --> 01:51:31,920
a child's heart would protect you in
battle.

2324
01:51:32,520 --> 01:51:36,300
They would cover themselves with the
blood of these innocent children and run

2325
01:51:36,301 --> 01:51:40,050
through these fucking neighborhoods.
It's just horrific,

2326
01:51:40,051 --> 01:51:42,570
horrific stuff.
And that's going on right now.

2327
01:51:42,571 --> 01:51:47,340
Like Liberia right now is a terrifying,
terrifying place.

2328
01:51:47,670 --> 01:51:49,980
And if it happened in Los Angeles,
she would say,

2329
01:51:49,981 --> 01:51:52,230
Holy Shit,
the apocalypse is here.

2330
01:51:52,560 --> 01:51:57,030
What's the apocalypse is here on earth.
It's just not in woodland hills.

2331
01:51:57,031 --> 01:52:00,240
It's not in studio city.
It's not in Beverly Hills,

2332
01:52:00,420 --> 01:52:01,530
but it's,
it's here.

2333
01:52:01,650 --> 01:52:02,483
It's on earth.

2334
01:52:03,590 --> 01:52:06,500
Yeah,
sometimes I like that.

2335
01:52:06,530 --> 01:52:11,530
The awareness of how much fucked up shit
is happening all over the place is when

2336
01:52:12,501 --> 01:52:16,460
I am tuned into that frequency.
Like I felt very overwhelmed and just

2337
01:52:16,461 --> 01:52:17,330
like,
fuck,

2338
01:52:17,331 --> 01:52:19,940
I don't know what to do with that.
Not that I have to do anything,

2339
01:52:19,941 --> 01:52:24,941
but I mean I don't know what to do with
that because like on my show,

2340
01:52:25,830 --> 01:52:27,500
my show,
it was twice a week and on a Thursday

2341
01:52:27,501 --> 01:52:30,200
show I've started featuring.
I have a friend of mine who's a dog

2342
01:52:30,201 --> 01:52:34,430
trainer and um,
she goes to specifically the downy

2343
01:52:34,431 --> 01:52:35,780
shelter,
but other shelters

2344
01:52:37,400 --> 01:52:41,330
kill shelters and takes these dogs and
trains them and gets them more

2345
01:52:41,331 --> 01:52:44,750
adoptable.
And so I've been featuring a dog a week

2346
01:52:45,200 --> 01:52:47,480
hoping to try to get the word out.
Um,

2347
01:52:47,630 --> 01:52:50,240
but now that I'm aware of all these
different dogs,

2348
01:52:50,241 --> 01:52:53,660
I'm also aware when all of a sudden you
go to the website and it says,

2349
01:52:53,661 --> 01:52:54,680
you know,
someone's,

2350
01:52:54,710 --> 01:52:55,850
I was no longer available.

2351
01:52:55,850 --> 01:52:57,830
And I know what that means now.
I mean,

2352
01:52:57,890 --> 01:53:01,880
it means that dog has been put down as
opposed to so and so may not be

2353
01:53:01,881 --> 01:53:04,730
available or so and so has been adopted
or so and so's with a rescue.

2354
01:53:04,731 --> 01:53:07,220
It's like,
I think when it says is no longer

2355
01:53:07,221 --> 01:53:09,320
available.
And I used to just think,

2356
01:53:09,350 --> 01:53:10,700
oh,
someone adopted that dog.

2357
01:53:10,701 --> 01:53:11,091
It's like,
no,

2358
01:53:11,091 --> 01:53:14,000
that dog got put down.
And so now that I'm aware of all this,

2359
01:53:14,001 --> 01:53:19,001
I find I'm get emotionally attached to
each dog that I don't personally know.

2360
01:53:19,730 --> 01:53:22,820
And it's,
I'm overwhelmed with the sadness of

2361
01:53:22,821 --> 01:53:24,800
that.
And then I think like this is,

2362
01:53:24,920 --> 01:53:29,540
this is nothing compared to the
horrendous awfulness on every level.

2363
01:53:29,930 --> 01:53:33,290
It's hard to that thing of like,
I want to make the tiniest difference in

2364
01:53:33,291 --> 01:53:37,880
one little life.
It's easy for me to just feel

2365
01:53:38,120 --> 01:53:41,090
overwhelmed,
to try to even be doing anything because

2366
01:53:41,091 --> 01:53:42,550
there's always something so much,
much

2367
01:53:42,550 --> 01:53:44,440
worse.
Yeah,

2368
01:53:44,610 --> 01:53:46,960
that's a good way of describing it.
There is always something somewhere,

2369
01:53:47,140 --> 01:53:52,120
something so much worse.
But I think in some weird way that also

2370
01:53:52,121 --> 01:53:54,250
makes us appreciate when things are
good.

2371
01:53:54,820 --> 01:53:59,110
And that's one of the more unique
aspects of today is that you can pay

2372
01:53:59,111 --> 01:54:02,020
attention to some of the horrific parts
of the world and go,

2373
01:54:02,021 --> 01:54:04,290
wow,
we are so fucking lucky that we're not

2374
01:54:04,300 --> 01:54:07,540
trapped in North Korea.
We're so lucky that we're not living in

2375
01:54:07,541 --> 01:54:09,190
the Congo.
We're so lucky that.

2376
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:11,830
I mean,
my friend Justin,

2377
01:54:12,010 --> 01:54:12,843
he,
uh,

2378
01:54:13,090 --> 01:54:17,290
builds wells in the Congo and he goes to
the Congo and he's there for like six

2379
01:54:17,291 --> 01:54:20,710
months at a time,
just got malaria for the second time and

2380
01:54:21,250 --> 01:54:22,710
he's,
I mean he's a,

2381
01:54:22,780 --> 01:54:27,350
just a gem of a human being and he is a
part of this,

2382
01:54:28,370 --> 01:54:32,650
this charity called fight for the
forgotten where he goes and it helps

2383
01:54:32,651 --> 01:54:37,330
these pygmies build water wells and
maintains them for them and stuff like

2384
01:54:37,331 --> 01:54:37,660
that.

2385
01:54:37,660 --> 01:54:42,190
But this guy's experience when he talks
about the horrific plight of these

2386
01:54:42,191 --> 01:54:45,610
people and we'll all the gun through,
gone through and all the persecution

2387
01:54:45,611 --> 01:54:49,480
they've,
they've experienced it just really you

2388
01:54:49,481 --> 01:54:51,670
leave and you want to be nicer to
people.

2389
01:54:51,700 --> 01:54:54,750
You want to listen to him talk and you
listen to his experiences.

2390
01:54:54,790 --> 01:54:58,330
You,
you one have hope because the guy's

2391
01:54:58,331 --> 01:55:01,840
willing to leave Dallas,
Texas and fly down to the Congo and,

2392
01:55:01,841 --> 01:55:04,930
and become a part of these people's
lives and try to help them and elevate

2393
01:55:04,931 --> 01:55:07,180
them.
So there's all this hope for humanity in

2394
01:55:07,181 --> 01:55:10,840
that this person that has no real
connection with these folks other than

2395
01:55:10,841 --> 01:55:14,080
just meeting them once and then falling
in love with their tribe,

2396
01:55:14,770 --> 01:55:16,780
that that is possible.
But it's also,

2397
01:55:16,820 --> 01:55:18,520
it makes you realize like,
God,

2398
01:55:18,521 --> 01:55:22,510
we were looking for problems today.
We're looking for things to be

2399
01:55:22,511 --> 01:55:24,040
automated.
Should I fixed my nose?

2400
01:55:24,230 --> 01:55:27,910
Do you know what I mean?
But things could be so much worse.

2401
01:55:28,360 --> 01:55:30,910
And again,
it comes back to that spectrum and the

2402
01:55:30,911 --> 01:55:34,300
spectrum of information that we're,
that we can access today.

2403
01:55:34,510 --> 01:55:38,180
It's almost mean there's,
the brain is really not a,

2404
01:55:38,590 --> 01:55:43,150
it's not really available to tune into
all these different parts,

2405
01:55:43,230 --> 01:55:45,120
the world all the time.
And so you could,

2406
01:55:45,390 --> 01:55:47,880
it's so easy to lose focus.
It's so easy to lose

2407
01:55:48,110 --> 01:55:50,370
effective.
It really is.

2408
01:55:50,371 --> 01:55:51,270
I just,
um,

2409
01:55:51,900 --> 01:55:56,120
I went to France a couple of weeks ago.
We could go because you go to Paris.

2410
01:55:56,130 --> 01:55:58,770
I did three scared.
No.

2411
01:55:58,920 --> 01:56:02,580
Um,
we originally were going to go in

2412
01:56:02,581 --> 01:56:07,581
December and we rescheduled even though
I know that the chances of anything

2413
01:56:07,891 --> 01:56:11,010
actually happening are so small and it's
almost that thing of like,

2414
01:56:11,011 --> 01:56:13,620
I'm not that special that it's,
something's going to happen to me,

2415
01:56:13,621 --> 01:56:16,230
you know,
but I think there is that after the

2416
01:56:16,231 --> 01:56:18,180
attack we started thinking maybe this
is,

2417
01:56:18,460 --> 01:56:20,160
you know,
why were we going in the winter anyway?

2418
01:56:20,161 --> 01:56:21,540
Everyone says it's not the best time to
go,

2419
01:56:21,541 --> 01:56:24,870
so let's just postpone it because we had
always been debating should we go in

2420
01:56:24,871 --> 01:56:25,860
December,
April.

2421
01:56:26,220 --> 01:56:30,390
Um,
but then after I,

2422
01:56:31,680 --> 01:56:33,690
I wasn't scared once we made the
decision to go,

2423
01:56:33,691 --> 01:56:35,550
but I wondered are we making the wrong
decision?

2424
01:56:35,730 --> 01:56:38,940
But once I was there I was absolutely.
I also moved to New York.

2425
01:56:39,040 --> 01:56:43,080
I'm like shortly after nine slash 11.
And once I was there I was not scared.

2426
01:56:43,081 --> 01:56:43,710
It's,
I think,

2427
01:56:43,710 --> 01:56:46,860
feel like for me,
the fear is more in contemplating going

2428
01:56:46,861 --> 01:56:48,110
there.
Um,

2429
01:56:48,420 --> 01:56:52,440
but anyway,
being there,

2430
01:56:52,560 --> 01:56:56,640
being in another country where my daily
thoughts aren't like,

2431
01:56:56,641 --> 01:56:58,110
Oh,
I've got to check twitter all the time

2432
01:56:58,111 --> 01:56:59,580
and I've got to do this.
Like whatever.

2433
01:56:59,581 --> 01:57:04,290
The bullshit of my daily life is having
that instead be replaced with,

2434
01:57:04,291 --> 01:57:08,550
I'm just trying to remember how to say
this word and try and like trying to

2435
01:57:08,551 --> 01:57:10,950
communicate with people and hoping they
can understand me.

2436
01:57:11,240 --> 01:57:15,210
Um,
and looking into all this beautiful art

2437
01:57:15,211 --> 01:57:16,350
and you know,
everything that you do.

2438
01:57:16,830 --> 01:57:19,710
Um,
it really upon coming back,

2439
01:57:19,711 --> 01:57:24,330
I'm finding readjusting into the date.
My daily routine is more difficult and I

2440
01:57:24,331 --> 01:57:29,331
don't want to.
I don't want to go back to a caring so

2441
01:57:29,731 --> 01:57:33,060
much about minute bullshit.
I feel like that's kind of the gift of

2442
01:57:33,061 --> 01:57:34,650
travel.
Not local travel,

2443
01:57:34,690 --> 01:57:37,680
not small trips,
but the gift of going to another country

2444
01:57:37,681 --> 01:57:39,270
or being around people who speak a
different language,

2445
01:57:39,620 --> 01:57:43,560
um,
is that it kind of like takes your brain

2446
01:57:43,561 --> 01:57:48,030
and treat it like a snow globe and then
everything kind of gets readjusted and

2447
01:57:48,031 --> 01:57:52,260
you remember that there's a so much more
than whatever it is you've been waking

2448
01:57:52,261 --> 01:57:53,250
up and thinking about

2449
01:57:54,180 --> 01:57:57,150
also that their world is so vastly
different.

2450
01:57:57,390 --> 01:57:59,730
The language is different.
The sounds they make are different.

2451
01:57:59,840 --> 01:58:03,150
Their traditions are different,
their customs are different,

2452
01:58:03,151 --> 01:58:05,670
the food they eat is different.
The neighborhoods,

2453
01:58:05,671 --> 01:58:07,830
they walked down and live in our
different there.

2454
01:58:07,880 --> 01:58:10,890
There are established patterns are just
different.

2455
01:58:10,891 --> 01:58:13,800
And then when you experience those
different patterns and different

2456
01:58:13,801 --> 01:58:16,190
cultures and different cities,
I think it's,

2457
01:58:16,220 --> 01:58:17,400
it's,
it makes you just go,

2458
01:58:17,430 --> 01:58:19,620
oh yeah,
it's a big fucking world.

2459
01:58:20,100 --> 01:58:20,770
You know,

2460
01:58:20,770 --> 01:58:22,960
might it,
cause it's so easy to think that it's

2461
01:58:22,961 --> 01:58:27,700
all exactly as that your life is very
similar to whatever the life that

2462
01:58:27,701 --> 01:58:29,160
everyone else is living in the world.
Go out there.

2463
01:58:30,330 --> 01:58:31,280
Like I kept,
I was thinking,

2464
01:58:31,290 --> 01:58:32,051
and by the way,
I'm not,

2465
01:58:32,051 --> 01:58:35,620
it's not like I was in the rain forest
or something.

2466
01:58:35,621 --> 01:58:39,580
Like I recognized I was in a place that
all things considered is actually pretty

2467
01:58:39,581 --> 01:58:41,970
similar to where we.
But um,

2468
01:58:42,130 --> 01:58:46,120
we went out to [inaudible] one day and
sort of drove to the countryside and

2469
01:58:47,620 --> 01:58:50,350
that's where Monet Monet lived and what
he painted,

2470
01:58:50,790 --> 01:58:51,810
um,
it's,

2471
01:58:51,840 --> 01:58:54,460
it's his house and there's the gardens
that he painted.

2472
01:58:54,520 --> 01:58:55,870
Oh Wow.
You can go visit his house.

2473
01:58:56,170 --> 01:58:59,590
It's really cool.
But I was thinking,

2474
01:59:00,280 --> 01:59:03,700
what if you just lived out here?
Like what is,

2475
01:59:03,740 --> 01:59:06,220
what is that life like to your,
you're,

2476
01:59:06,280 --> 01:59:07,630
you know,
an hour,

2477
01:59:08,110 --> 01:59:10,150
you're in the countryside,
like what do they do?

2478
01:59:10,240 --> 01:59:12,010
What goes on?
Because of course,

2479
01:59:12,040 --> 01:59:13,600
because I,
to me it's like,

2480
01:59:13,601 --> 01:59:15,710
it feels like very little goes on,
but that's probably not.

2481
01:59:16,760 --> 01:59:20,240
Well I think it's similar to the drive
up to San Francisco,

2482
01:59:21,060 --> 01:59:23,990
drive up to San Francisco.
You take the five and you stop at one of

2483
01:59:23,991 --> 01:59:28,160
those like farm towns.
You like what in the fuck you know,

2484
01:59:28,161 --> 01:59:31,310
and I want to go to a restaurant and
talk to some kid is like washing dishes

2485
01:59:31,311 --> 01:59:32,144
and go,
hey man,

2486
01:59:32,240 --> 01:59:34,250
grow up here.
What the fuck did you do?

2487
01:59:34,280 --> 01:59:35,960
What do you guys do?
How much math do you guys have?

2488
01:59:36,470 --> 01:59:38,990
Like what's going on?
That's where people get like super

2489
01:59:38,991 --> 01:59:43,420
desperado and drugs too because they're
just looking for some kind of crazy

2490
01:59:43,421 --> 01:59:46,310
escape.
You'll just drive into town of 3000

2491
01:59:46,311 --> 01:59:47,750
people in the middle of nowhere and
you're like,

2492
01:59:47,751 --> 01:59:50,410
what?
What is the.

2493
01:59:51,530 --> 01:59:54,230
And there's a lot of right wing shit up
there too.

2494
01:59:54,410 --> 01:59:56,150
That was one of the weirdest things.
I've always think.

2495
01:59:56,210 --> 01:59:59,720
I always think of California as being
pretty left wing,

2496
01:59:59,721 --> 02:00:01,400
pretty open minded,
pretty liberal.

2497
02:00:01,560 --> 02:00:04,980
I grew up in Orange County,
so I did not have that sense of awe

2498
02:00:05,710 --> 02:00:08,560
when you drive up like through the farm
areas,

2499
02:00:08,830 --> 02:00:12,130
like you'll see like these gigantic Mitt
Romney for president sides.

2500
02:00:12,131 --> 02:00:14,490
This was like during the election,
but uh,

2501
02:00:14,590 --> 02:00:16,890
I remember driving up there going like
in the,

2502
02:00:16,900 --> 02:00:18,600
you know,
Obama is the,

2503
02:00:18,610 --> 02:00:21,460
you know,
is the real enemy of our country,

2504
02:00:21,461 --> 02:00:24,280
like these big ass billboards where
people had put up not,

2505
02:00:24,281 --> 02:00:27,880
not just like a thought that they had,
but they wanted to project it out to

2506
02:00:27,881 --> 02:00:30,790
everybody driving up there buying apples
or whatever the fuck they're buying

2507
02:00:31,840 --> 02:00:35,320
apples or math or math.
We were part of Orange County from

2508
02:00:35,630 --> 02:00:39,280
a corona del Mar.
Super right wing,

2509
02:00:39,281 --> 02:00:40,450
right?
Very.

2510
02:00:40,451 --> 02:00:42,430
Yeah.
It waS very homogenous.

2511
02:00:43,450 --> 02:00:44,350
Very,
very white,

2512
02:00:44,440 --> 02:00:45,820
very blond,
blue eyed,

2513
02:00:46,290 --> 02:00:48,670
great athletic killer.
Yes.

2514
02:00:48,910 --> 02:00:52,040
It really is.
That's the,

2515
02:00:52,090 --> 02:00:56,100
that's their cash crop.
Journalistic is very athletic and we'll

2516
02:00:56,760 --> 02:01:01,060
just that foR the kids that I went to
school with were just very good at

2517
02:01:01,061 --> 02:01:04,380
sports and they valued that.
Uh,

2518
02:01:04,420 --> 02:01:05,650
and,
you know,

2519
02:01:05,651 --> 02:01:07,450
I,
I definitely do not feel like I fit in.

2520
02:01:07,451 --> 02:01:08,410
I was,
it was,

2521
02:01:08,590 --> 02:01:13,590
it was round and soft and pasty and had
black hair and brown eyes and just could

2522
02:01:14,531 --> 02:01:16,050
not keep up.
Uh,

2523
02:01:17,930 --> 02:01:21,700
I always joked that it was like a leni
riefenstahl wet dream there.

2524
02:01:22,020 --> 02:01:25,210
Um,
it was just very this very that,

2525
02:01:25,340 --> 02:01:28,810
that the pride of white people there.
Um,

2526
02:01:29,800 --> 02:01:33,980
and I resented growing up there and then
once I got older I realized all the,

2527
02:01:34,210 --> 02:01:34,960
the,
you know,

2528
02:01:34,960 --> 02:01:38,470
I realize why my parents moved there
because I was born in oakland and

2529
02:01:38,471 --> 02:01:39,680
apparently it was kind of rough.

2530
02:01:39,680 --> 02:01:41,060
So they,
uh,

2531
02:01:41,090 --> 02:01:45,500
they fled with the rest of the white
people to orange county where it's

2532
02:01:45,580 --> 02:01:50,450
incredibly safe and everything is
manicured and the schools are nice and

2533
02:01:50,960 --> 02:01:54,500
you know,
it's safe being the prominent thing I

2534
02:01:54,501 --> 02:01:56,330
think.
And growing up I was like,

2535
02:01:56,331 --> 02:02:00,620
why,
why the fuck would you choose this place

2536
02:02:00,621 --> 02:02:03,800
where we're so different in every way?
Then eVeryone here,

2537
02:02:03,810 --> 02:02:05,240
I didn't get it.
And then,

2538
02:02:05,600 --> 02:02:06,440
You know,
as an older,

2539
02:02:07,250 --> 02:02:08,520
as an adult,
I go back and I,

2540
02:02:08,521 --> 02:02:11,630
and I see it is,
it's nice and it is peaceful and it is

2541
02:02:11,631 --> 02:02:14,960
calm and I get why you'd want to raise
your kids there.

2542
02:02:15,020 --> 02:02:18,200
It was weird that you get these groups
of white people together and they just

2543
02:02:18,201 --> 02:02:19,070
calm the fuck down.

2544
02:02:21,440 --> 02:02:26,090
I'm just looking to sit with a bunch of
other white people and calm down.

2545
02:02:26,270 --> 02:02:28,610
I'm doing the irvine improv this
weekend,

2546
02:02:29,220 --> 02:02:33,590
like the safest city in America and like
fucking 100 years running or something

2547
02:02:33,591 --> 02:02:36,110
crazy.
I grew up in a bar in town and I thought

2548
02:02:36,140 --> 02:02:39,020
irvine was more boring,
more boring,

2549
02:02:39,710 --> 02:02:42,650
but it's a great place to do stand up.
Nice folks.

2550
02:02:42,880 --> 02:02:46,490
Yeah.
How did you get.

2551
02:02:46,520 --> 02:02:49,310
What was your path to get on?
Like the adam carolla show?

2552
02:02:49,550 --> 02:02:51,320
What was your path to get into
podcasting?

2553
02:02:51,860 --> 02:02:52,521
A.
Okay.

2554
02:02:52,521 --> 02:02:55,870
So I started writing for magazines and
newspapers.

2555
02:02:55,880 --> 02:02:58,260
Very young.
And how old were you?

2556
02:02:58,340 --> 02:03:01,130
I was 18 and I did some stuff for the la
times.

2557
02:03:01,190 --> 02:03:02,480
That's awesome.
Thank you.

2558
02:03:02,520 --> 02:03:05,270
Must be a fucking bang up writer.
Thank you.

2559
02:03:05,680 --> 02:03:06,550
I,
I'm,

2560
02:03:07,090 --> 02:03:08,380
I'm okay with words.
And stuff,

2561
02:03:09,450 --> 02:03:11,990
I was good,
I was very in love with myself.

2562
02:03:13,250 --> 02:03:15,520
I was like la times today,
you know,

2563
02:03:15,980 --> 02:03:19,310
my stars just I,
I really thought as a freelancer because

2564
02:03:19,311 --> 02:03:22,100
then I went to college,
freelanced all through college,

2565
02:03:22,430 --> 02:03:26,630
came back to orange county,
began writing for people and for rolling

2566
02:03:26,631 --> 02:03:31,430
stone and it happened fast and I was
young and I was like,

2567
02:03:32,210 --> 02:03:33,470
there's just no stopping me.

2568
02:03:33,560 --> 02:03:34,700
And I didn't realize that,
like,

2569
02:03:34,701 --> 02:03:35,660
no,
it kinda just,

2570
02:03:36,050 --> 02:03:38,630
it,
it's not like I do this today and then

2571
02:03:38,631 --> 02:03:42,500
cover of vanity fair tomorrow.
Like first of all there's only so far

2572
02:03:42,501 --> 02:03:44,360
I'm going to be able to get if I'm
staying in orange county.

2573
02:03:44,361 --> 02:03:45,171
And I ended up,
like I said,

2574
02:03:45,171 --> 02:03:48,230
playing in a band.
I'm writing for the osi weekly while

2575
02:03:48,231 --> 02:03:49,970
still doing the band.
I played guitar.

2576
02:03:50,120 --> 02:03:52,250
Did you really?
I played drums too.

2577
02:03:52,251 --> 02:03:54,760
I was the drummer initially.
Uh,

2578
02:03:54,790 --> 02:03:57,290
and there were three of us and I was
like,

2579
02:03:57,350 --> 02:03:58,880
you know,
don't get too in love with me because

2580
02:03:58,881 --> 02:04:00,720
I'm not staying in orange county for the
ice.

2581
02:04:01,040 --> 02:04:04,070
Moved back to orange county and I was
there for five years after college and

2582
02:04:04,071 --> 02:04:06,560
the entire time I was like,
this is not where I'm supposed to be,

2583
02:04:06,561 --> 02:04:08,210
this is not what I wanted to do with my
life.

2584
02:04:08,860 --> 02:04:10,880
I was,
I'm sure it was such an unpleasant

2585
02:04:10,881 --> 02:04:13,090
asshole to be around because I was like,
no,

2586
02:04:13,530 --> 02:04:14,960
no,
no,

2587
02:04:15,770 --> 02:04:16,970
no,
I've changed.

2588
02:04:18,800 --> 02:04:20,030
But back then,
yeah,

2589
02:04:20,031 --> 02:04:23,060
it was like a year for the band.
like don't get too used to.

2590
02:04:23,980 --> 02:04:25,680
I'm not,
I'm not staying here.

2591
02:04:25,700 --> 02:04:27,050
Experiences limb.
Yeah.

2592
02:04:27,051 --> 02:04:30,200
And especially I feel bad because a
couple of the people in the band,

2593
02:04:30,770 --> 02:04:32,450
um,
I mean they're still in bands,

2594
02:04:32,451 --> 02:04:35,030
like they really wanted to make this
happen and I was like,

2595
02:04:35,180 --> 02:04:38,370
this is just my stupid little thing I'm
doing on the side while I'm pursuing

2596
02:04:38,371 --> 02:04:40,470
what I'm really trying to pursue in
college.

2597
02:04:41,640 --> 02:04:43,770
I love the college I went to.
I'm glad I went to college,

2598
02:04:43,771 --> 02:04:45,930
I believe in college,
but I also think it can make you a

2599
02:04:45,931 --> 02:04:48,960
little bit insufferable and that's who I
was when I graduated.

2600
02:04:48,961 --> 02:04:52,620
So I was writing at a certain point,
I was like,

2601
02:04:53,020 --> 02:04:57,930
I have to have like my,
the life that I want to lead is headed

2602
02:04:57,931 --> 02:04:59,970
this way,
but the one I'm leading is going this

2603
02:04:59,971 --> 02:05:01,440
way and I've got to bridge the gap.

2604
02:05:02,130 --> 02:05:04,860
So I moved To New York,
I made the decision to move to New York

2605
02:05:04,861 --> 02:05:08,160
and then nine slash 11 happened like six
days after I made the decision and I was

2606
02:05:08,161 --> 02:05:08,851
like,
I don't care.

2607
02:05:08,851 --> 02:05:12,420
I'm going anyway even though I know.
I'm glad I did though.

2608
02:05:12,660 --> 02:05:15,060
What was the thought process behind New
York?

2609
02:05:15,270 --> 02:05:16,230
I,
um,

2610
02:05:16,800 --> 02:05:21,060
so the most cosmopolitan,
most writing because that was my,

2611
02:05:21,160 --> 02:05:23,070
you know,
writing for magazines was my thing and

2612
02:05:23,071 --> 02:05:27,480
writing in general,
it was kind of the way it was where all

2613
02:05:27,481 --> 02:05:29,790
that took place.
Like all the people that I was talking

2614
02:05:29,791 --> 02:05:31,440
to when I was freelancing for national
magazines,

2615
02:05:31,441 --> 02:05:33,780
we're based in New York.
It just seemed like the place to go for

2616
02:05:33,781 --> 02:05:35,490
that.
it also,

2617
02:05:35,760 --> 02:05:40,760
I wanted to be in a city and I remember
my band toured and I met this guy and I

2618
02:05:42,091 --> 02:05:45,660
was walking around san francisco and san
francisco felt like such a city to me

2619
02:05:45,900 --> 02:05:47,760
and I was like,
I really want to be in a place that has

2620
02:05:47,761 --> 02:05:49,320
the feel of a city.

2621
02:05:49,830 --> 02:05:54,830
And I met this guy who worked at the
venue that we were playing and he was

2622
02:05:54,871 --> 02:05:58,740
telling me that he was moving to
brooklyn because san francisco Just

2623
02:05:58,741 --> 02:06:01,770
wasn't enough of a city for him.
And I remember the kind of that was

2624
02:06:01,771 --> 02:06:02,670
blowing my mind.
so I was like,

2625
02:06:02,671 --> 02:06:05,430
this feels like such a city to me if
this isn't the city enough,

2626
02:06:05,460 --> 02:06:08,610
like what am I doing in these cow
pastures in orange county?

2627
02:06:09,090 --> 02:06:10,320
So,
um,

2628
02:06:10,500 --> 02:06:15,500
I made the decision to move and then
eventually moved and I was there for

2629
02:06:15,901 --> 02:06:19,170
about nine years.
First couple of years,

2630
02:06:19,920 --> 02:06:24,120
much,
much more difficult than I thought it

2631
02:06:24,121 --> 02:06:24,490
was.
I,

2632
02:06:24,490 --> 02:06:28,230
I felt weirdly insecure and I hadn't
expected to feel socially insecure,

2633
02:06:28,231 --> 02:06:29,430
but I just,
I left everything.

2634
02:06:29,431 --> 02:06:30,350
I knew.
I left the bay.

2635
02:06:30,370 --> 02:06:32,670
Like I didn't know where I fit in.
Suddenly,

2636
02:06:32,980 --> 02:06:36,120
um,
especially after having been in the band

2637
02:06:36,121 --> 02:06:39,330
like that my whole life during the time
I was in the band was,

2638
02:06:39,360 --> 02:06:42,030
and also I wrote about music before I
was ever in the band,

2639
02:06:42,420 --> 02:06:47,420
so my life was going to shows or playing
shows and I had a group of friends and a

2640
02:06:47,910 --> 02:06:50,280
community that I really missed once I
left them.

2641
02:06:50,790 --> 02:06:52,110
So then I was in New York and I was
like,

2642
02:06:52,111 --> 02:06:55,380
I don't have friends and I don't have a
job and I'm freelancing,

2643
02:06:55,381 --> 02:06:57,450
but it's not enough.
I don't know what I'm doing and I feel

2644
02:06:57,451 --> 02:07:00,420
very alone and I feel uncomfortable and
weird.

2645
02:07:01,020 --> 02:07:03,570
Thankfully that went away.
It just took longer than I thought it

2646
02:07:03,571 --> 02:07:05,070
would.
Um,

2647
02:07:05,430 --> 02:07:10,430
got a job at time out New York where I
worked for a number of years and while I

2648
02:07:10,951 --> 02:07:13,250
was at time out New York,
um,

2649
02:07:13,290 --> 02:07:17,130
they were looking for editors to go on
television to talk about events goIng on

2650
02:07:17,131 --> 02:07:18,390
in the city.
So I said,

2651
02:07:18,391 --> 02:07:18,930
I,
I'm like,

2652
02:07:18,930 --> 02:07:21,330
I'll do it.
And um,

2653
02:07:21,720 --> 02:07:24,990
and it was channel four.
So wbc,

2654
02:07:25,950 --> 02:07:30,000
they really liked me and they wanted me
to keep coming back and doing it every

2655
02:07:30,001 --> 02:07:31,340
saturday morning.
Um,

2656
02:07:31,740 --> 02:07:34,140
so when they initially they were going
to have a group of editors doing it and

2657
02:07:34,141 --> 02:07:37,730
they decided they just wanted,
which I thought was,

2658
02:07:37,930 --> 02:07:41,380
was great because I was so destined for
greatness and it gets all happening.

2659
02:07:42,370 --> 02:07:43,800
That's how I felt.
Um,

2660
02:07:44,630 --> 02:07:47,770
I hope it's clear that I'm trying to be
self deprecating worry.

2661
02:07:47,780 --> 02:07:51,880
I'm coming off as an asshole
anyway.

2662
02:07:51,950 --> 02:07:54,060
Um,
I began doing that a lot and I realized

2663
02:07:54,100 --> 02:07:55,990
I really enjoyed that.
I enjoyed the,

2664
02:07:55,991 --> 02:07:58,550
that performance element.
I guess I'm right.

2665
02:07:58,750 --> 02:07:59,920
I like to go on,
on camera.

2666
02:08:00,130 --> 02:08:02,620
Um,
started doing other tv stuff.

2667
02:08:02,890 --> 02:08:07,890
Um,
and then I was aware of youtube and I

2668
02:08:08,261 --> 02:08:10,370
was experimenting with youtube and I was
putting my,

2669
02:08:10,420 --> 02:08:13,780
my television clips.
I started doing a lot of new stuff.

2670
02:08:14,260 --> 02:08:18,040
I was putting my television clips on
youtube and then I don't know what made

2671
02:08:18,041 --> 02:08:18,910
me decide one day,
like,

2672
02:08:18,911 --> 02:08:22,390
what if I just recorded myself doing
some book reviews.

2673
02:08:22,570 --> 02:08:23,560
I would,
if I just did,

2674
02:08:23,561 --> 02:08:24,550
just talked,
you know,

2675
02:08:24,560 --> 02:08:28,180
the question to answer,
like talk directly to my little bit of

2676
02:08:28,181 --> 02:08:30,400
an audience that I'm beginning to have
because have a blog as well.

2677
02:08:30,790 --> 02:08:33,730
Um,
and so I did that and the response to

2678
02:08:33,731 --> 02:08:35,170
that was so overwhelming.
I was like,

2679
02:08:35,171 --> 02:08:37,540
oh,
people don't care if it's polished when

2680
02:08:37,541 --> 02:08:40,120
you're dealing with the internet.
It's more about the immediacy and it's

2681
02:08:40,121 --> 02:08:42,510
more about you talking to them.
So I started getting into that and

2682
02:08:42,511 --> 02:08:45,000
started doing the various web shows.
Um,

2683
02:08:45,020 --> 02:08:47,170
and then I created a show called alison
rosen engineer,

2684
02:08:47,240 --> 02:08:51,130
best friend on ustream and I would do
that.

2685
02:08:51,340 --> 02:08:55,120
It was a talk show from my living room
that I woUld do for three hours every

2686
02:08:55,121 --> 02:08:59,620
sunday evening.
And it was not that dissimilar.

2687
02:08:59,621 --> 02:09:02,920
There's so many negatives in that
sentence from the podcasts that I have

2688
02:09:02,921 --> 02:09:04,030
now.
That's where I started.

2689
02:09:04,031 --> 02:09:06,400
A lot of the segments that I do now was
on that show.

2690
02:09:06,401 --> 02:09:09,820
And by the way,
I remember when I was used streaming you

2691
02:09:09,821 --> 02:09:13,960
were also on ustream and oftentimes on
the front page of ustream it would,

2692
02:09:13,990 --> 02:09:16,240
it would have me and you way back when?

2693
02:09:16,270 --> 02:09:17,103
Cruising.
Ma'am.

2694
02:09:17,140 --> 02:09:18,230
Are you still on ustream?
Yeah,

2695
02:09:19,300 --> 02:09:23,890
we don't stream on ustream anymore
because we were doing it and we're

2696
02:09:23,891 --> 02:09:25,900
trying to do it simultaneously with
youtube.

2697
02:09:25,901 --> 02:09:28,240
But there's something wrong with our tri
caster.

2698
02:09:28,300 --> 02:09:31,270
I see.
Still sucks when it doesn't really want

2699
02:09:31,271 --> 02:09:31,961
to do it,
It would work.

2700
02:09:31,961 --> 02:09:35,420
It's just not solid and in one will drop
off and crash.

2701
02:09:36,020 --> 02:09:40,570
So we had to choose one platform.
And the thing about youtube is youtube

2702
02:09:40,571 --> 02:09:44,200
lets you pause and it lets you backtrack
while you're actually watching it.

2703
02:09:44,620 --> 02:09:48,970
Ustream doesn't support that future and
there's more users or watching youtube.

2704
02:09:48,971 --> 02:09:51,850
So we just decided to jump ship.
Yeah.

2705
02:09:52,840 --> 02:09:54,370
Um,
I,

2706
02:09:56,810 --> 02:09:59,420
I had begun to wonder

2707
02:10:00,940 --> 02:10:05,940
is the audience there for online
streaming visual stuff in the same way

2708
02:10:07,161 --> 02:10:09,600
that they're there for podcasts?
I remember listening,

2709
02:10:09,610 --> 02:10:12,560
I was friends with doug benson and
listening to his podcast and I got this

2710
02:10:12,561 --> 02:10:17,050
curiosity about podcasts and then I
heard that adam corolla was looking for

2711
02:10:17,051 --> 02:10:19,730
a news girl and I was still in New York
at the time,

2712
02:10:20,180 --> 02:10:23,390
um,
and I like tried to send them my stuff

2713
02:10:23,391 --> 02:10:24,800
and I didn't hear anything and I'm like,
okay,

2714
02:10:24,830 --> 02:10:27,860
well I did,
I did what I can and no one's getting

2715
02:10:27,861 --> 02:10:28,860
back to me.
Um,

2716
02:10:28,910 --> 02:10:33,910
and then very rapIdly someone in my
family got sick and I moved from New

2717
02:10:35,450 --> 02:10:38,570
York to California to be with them
because we didn't.

2718
02:10:38,970 --> 02:10:41,330
That turns that that person Is actually
doing very well now.

2719
02:10:41,331 --> 02:10:43,430
But at the time it wasn't clear what
direction it was going to go.

2720
02:10:43,431 --> 02:10:45,530
And so I,
it didn't make sense to stay in New

2721
02:10:45,530 --> 02:10:46,730
York,
um,

2722
02:10:47,600 --> 02:10:48,500
when this was happening.

2723
02:10:48,500 --> 02:10:53,480
So I moved back kind of suddenly.
And then around the time that I was

2724
02:10:53,481 --> 02:10:56,450
lying on my parent's couch being like,
what the hell did I do?

2725
02:10:56,451 --> 02:10:58,730
Why did I,
I don't think that I made the right

2726
02:10:58,731 --> 02:10:59,570
move.
And coming back,

2727
02:10:59,571 --> 02:11:03,410
I got an email from like august and I
think the entire message was in the

2728
02:11:03,411 --> 02:11:05,870
subject line and it was just like,
you know,

2729
02:11:06,110 --> 02:11:07,820
adam carolla show this day,
this time,

2730
02:11:08,390 --> 02:11:09,620
can you come in?
And I said sure.

2731
02:11:10,610 --> 02:11:14,120
So I did.
And I auditioned and then they narrowed

2732
02:11:14,121 --> 02:11:17,120
it down to like four of us and then I
auditioned again and then I got the job.

2733
02:11:17,900 --> 02:11:19,040
So yeah,
it was,

2734
02:11:19,100 --> 02:11:22,580
it was nice.
Do you like doing your own thing better?

2735
02:11:23,230 --> 02:11:26,360
Um,
I began doing my own thing while I was

2736
02:11:26,361 --> 02:11:30,860
still there and I really enjoy doing my
own thing.

2737
02:11:30,950 --> 02:11:33,860
Yeah.
I also really liked being on that show

2738
02:11:33,861 --> 02:11:34,581
too,
you know,

2739
02:11:34,581 --> 02:11:39,560
I'm grateful for the four years that I
had there and I,

2740
02:11:39,650 --> 02:11:44,650
there's a lot of positive memories,
also a fair amount of things that I

2741
02:11:44,721 --> 02:11:45,800
think that was fucked up.

2742
02:11:46,130 --> 02:11:51,130
But you just sort of what I just did.
You don't have to.

2743
02:11:55,580 --> 02:11:57,740
I don't want you to.
I feel like you do want me to.

2744
02:11:57,770 --> 02:11:59,480
I don't want to do.
We don't want to do,

2745
02:12:01,100 --> 02:12:03,470
you know,
whenever I talk about it,

2746
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:06,590
it's funny,
I was thinking on this other day

2747
02:12:07,010 --> 02:12:08,150
whenever I talk about.
No,

2748
02:12:08,151 --> 02:12:12,530
I was thinking about this today close
thinking about this show and if it were,

2749
02:12:12,560 --> 02:12:14,450
if it was going to come up or not.
Um,

2750
02:12:14,900 --> 02:12:18,980
whenever I talk about all the stuff that
happened on that show near the end when

2751
02:12:18,981 --> 02:12:21,290
I was no longer on the show,
um,

2752
02:12:21,740 --> 02:12:26,420
I simultaneously afterwards wish I had
said nothing and wish I had said more.

2753
02:12:26,780 --> 02:12:28,130
It's so weird.
And I was like,

2754
02:12:28,131 --> 02:12:31,910
why?
Why do I have those dual competing

2755
02:12:31,911 --> 02:12:35,210
feelings?
And I think the reason is because I have

2756
02:12:35,211 --> 02:12:36,590
mixed feelings about the whole thing.

2757
02:12:36,590 --> 02:12:41,510
Like there's part of me that so thankful
for my time on the show and thankful

2758
02:12:41,660 --> 02:12:44,120
that I was given that opportunity and
you know,

2759
02:12:44,121 --> 02:12:47,780
we toured and I learned so much and I
have the best time and all that and

2760
02:12:47,781 --> 02:12:50,150
there's part of me that's like,
hey,

2761
02:12:50,360 --> 02:12:54,500
fuck you for not respecting me enough as
a human being to have a conversation

2762
02:12:54,501 --> 02:12:56,660
with me.
I sat next to you for four years.

2763
02:12:56,780 --> 02:12:59,540
Like you mean about the way you test?
Yeah.

2764
02:12:59,630 --> 02:13:01,390
So it makes sense.
Um,

2765
02:13:01,820 --> 02:13:04,730
I think that I still have mixed feelings
about everything,

2766
02:13:04,731 --> 02:13:07,700
but you know,
I'm aware of how fortunate I was and I'm

2767
02:13:07,910 --> 02:13:11,900
grateful for so much and I'm also,
I also feel like there were certain

2768
02:13:11,990 --> 02:13:15,350
elements of it that I think we're,
we're fucked up like I said.

2769
02:13:15,770 --> 02:13:17,060
So,
um,

2770
02:13:18,140 --> 02:13:19,580
where was I going with all of that
though?

2771
02:13:19,970 --> 02:13:23,030
You were talking about the bad aspects
of it.

2772
02:13:23,090 --> 02:13:24,200
Oh yeah.
Well no,

2773
02:13:24,201 --> 02:13:25,640
you were saying too.
I like doing my own thing.

2774
02:13:25,930 --> 02:13:28,880
Um,
yes I do,

2775
02:13:29,260 --> 02:13:31,070
but I.
But there's elements I miss.

2776
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:33,170
Well,
you were good on the show.

2777
02:13:33,200 --> 02:13:35,330
I remember that's where we met,
you know,

2778
02:13:35,560 --> 02:13:39,620
the times that you thought you and I had
some interesting exchanges or on the

2779
02:13:39,621 --> 02:13:42,490
show were you,
you were really tuned in like I,

2780
02:13:42,560 --> 02:13:46,760
I feel like I really love adam,
but I feel like adam is like,

2781
02:13:46,761 --> 02:13:51,380
you go over a guy's house and there's
just a bunch of locked doors and you can

2782
02:13:51,381 --> 02:13:53,900
hang out with them in the living room
when it's time to leave you leave and

2783
02:13:53,901 --> 02:13:55,160
you never get to see what's in those
locks

2784
02:13:55,180 --> 02:13:55,840
doors.
You don't.

2785
02:13:55,840 --> 02:13:58,420
Yeah.
You don't always feel like or ever feel

2786
02:13:58,421 --> 02:13:59,254
like you connect.

2787
02:13:59,290 --> 02:14:01,300
Yeah,
but that's just him.

2788
02:14:01,680 --> 02:14:06,680
That's his personality.
He's just a guy who isn't this like he's

2789
02:14:07,961 --> 02:14:11,280
got that radio persona or the tv
persona,

2790
02:14:11,290 --> 02:14:13,660
whatever the fuck it is.
And it's like this is,

2791
02:14:13,750 --> 02:14:16,600
this is his range,
this is where he's going down.

2792
02:14:16,900 --> 02:14:18,130
YoU know?
And so when you and I would have

2793
02:14:18,131 --> 02:14:20,270
conversations on the show,
one of the thIngs that I liked,

2794
02:14:20,290 --> 02:14:23,320
like you would ask like these
provocative questions,

2795
02:14:23,321 --> 02:14:27,220
you probe and do things and I don't
think necessarily he does know it was,

2796
02:14:27,580 --> 02:14:29,930
it was an interesting mixture.
Thank you.

2797
02:14:30,630 --> 02:14:31,540
Yeah,
I,

2798
02:14:31,680 --> 02:14:36,680
I thought so too.
So it was a surprise to me to find out

2799
02:14:37,001 --> 02:14:39,400
that he was unhappy.
He does argue or anything?

2800
02:14:39,401 --> 02:14:41,660
No.
Do you mean on air or.

2801
02:14:41,740 --> 02:14:42,573
We either one

2802
02:14:43,280 --> 02:14:45,200
never off air,
never off air.

2803
02:14:45,260 --> 02:14:47,720
Everything was always really cordial and
I thought,

2804
02:14:48,630 --> 02:14:50,970
I honestly thought everything was fine.
I thought everything was good.

2805
02:14:50,971 --> 02:14:52,830
I thought we were in a good place.
Like I was very,

2806
02:14:52,831 --> 02:14:57,831
very surprised to find out that how
wrong I was about how he was feeling

2807
02:14:58,441 --> 02:15:00,150
about everything.
Um,

2808
02:15:00,180 --> 02:15:03,150
and I only found that out because I was
fired,

2809
02:15:03,570 --> 02:15:06,060
you know,
and then he did an episode where he

2810
02:15:06,630 --> 02:15:11,630
talked about everything and it was like
I was kind of blown away by all the f

2811
02:15:12,390 --> 02:15:14,880
and I didn't listen to it for awhile,
but people were tweeting me,

2812
02:15:14,881 --> 02:15:16,860
a lot of people were tweeting me these
things like why'd you do this?

2813
02:15:16,861 --> 02:15:17,694
Why'd you do this?
And I'm like,

2814
02:15:18,120 --> 02:15:20,700
I didn't do any of that.
Like that is all,

2815
02:15:21,910 --> 02:15:23,960
it's not true.
And it was when,

2816
02:15:23,970 --> 02:15:26,020
when you're saying that you have to
explain what you're talking about.

2817
02:15:29,300 --> 02:15:31,820
Okay.
I'm trying to think of like one of the,

2818
02:15:32,180 --> 02:15:33,130
one of the shining example.

2819
02:15:33,190 --> 02:15:34,023
Well,

2820
02:15:36,250 --> 02:15:37,770
is this going to be one of those
simultaneous

2821
02:15:39,300 --> 02:15:43,480
too much and it makes me the most
uncomfortable is getting into the weeds

2822
02:15:43,481 --> 02:15:44,490
with all the details because yeah,

2823
02:15:44,590 --> 02:15:46,820
just sounds so petty.
It's like,

2824
02:15:46,821 --> 02:15:49,400
don't talk about it.
Bring it up.

2825
02:15:49,520 --> 02:15:50,353
It's no big deal.

2826
02:15:52,580 --> 02:15:54,080
Yeah.
I don't know.

2827
02:15:54,110 --> 02:15:57,440
It's weird though.
I don't know why I'm so afraid to get to

2828
02:15:57,441 --> 02:15:58,610
talk about it either.

2829
02:15:58,900 --> 02:16:01,560
You know that there's going to be a
bunch of people that have opinions and

2830
02:16:01,561 --> 02:16:04,230
it's all gonna come down on both sides.
It's going to be supportive people and

2831
02:16:04,231 --> 02:16:05,530
there's going to be negative.
Right?

2832
02:16:05,630 --> 02:16:07,320
Then they're going to try to tweet it.
Adam,

2833
02:16:07,321 --> 02:16:08,550
this flow can be sustainable.

2834
02:16:08,850 --> 02:16:10,920
You gave her an opportunity and she's
not getting.

2835
02:16:10,930 --> 02:16:11,401
Well.
Yes,

2836
02:16:11,401 --> 02:16:12,960
exactly.
Like I'm not gratefuL and she's not

2837
02:16:12,961 --> 02:16:14,580
getting oveR it either.
You know,

2838
02:16:14,581 --> 02:16:15,840
they feel like they're going to say
that.

2839
02:16:15,870 --> 02:16:19,020
how long ago was it that you left?
It was,

2840
02:16:19,110 --> 02:16:23,280
um,
very tail end of 2014.

2841
02:16:23,310 --> 02:16:24,070
Yeah,
get over it.

2842
02:16:24,070 --> 02:16:25,670
It's two years.
Well,

2843
02:16:25,680 --> 02:16:27,570
that's the funny thing is that I am
totally over it,

2844
02:16:27,571 --> 02:16:30,010
but it does come up.
Things

2845
02:16:30,010 --> 02:16:31,110
like podcasts,
I mean,

2846
02:16:31,280 --> 02:16:34,640
obviously it's got a giant show.
No,

2847
02:16:34,820 --> 02:16:36,850
it's going to come up.
Honestly.

2848
02:16:38,490 --> 02:16:39,323
It

2849
02:16:39,360 --> 02:16:43,290
was a good thing for me to go off on my
own.

2850
02:16:43,490 --> 02:16:46,290
Were yoU starting to go off on your own
while you were doing his show?

2851
02:16:46,330 --> 02:16:49,760
You doing another show from his studio
thing because he's got like a bunch of

2852
02:16:49,761 --> 02:16:53,270
different little.
I was doing my show on his network and

2853
02:16:53,280 --> 02:16:55,460
then he just stopped and he stopped and
started doing our own.

2854
02:16:55,930 --> 02:16:58,390
Well I got,
I got kicked off of.

2855
02:16:58,750 --> 02:17:01,390
I got,
I got the boot and we kicked off the

2856
02:17:01,391 --> 02:17:02,430
network to.
Yeah,

2857
02:17:02,640 --> 02:17:06,850
well I was surprised by that as well.
It was just a whole like,

2858
02:17:06,851 --> 02:17:08,530
we're done with you.
Wow.

2859
02:17:09,340 --> 02:17:13,960
So I began doing my show on my own.

2860
02:17:14,450 --> 02:17:17,840
And did it make you reexamine how you do
your show?

2861
02:17:17,900 --> 02:17:19,370
Oh uh,
what?

2862
02:17:19,400 --> 02:17:21,430
In what way did you try to like,
was there a.

2863
02:17:21,740 --> 02:17:23,210
Was there a part of you that was like,
okay,

2864
02:17:23,211 --> 02:17:25,070
well is there something about me that's
annoying?

2865
02:17:26,090 --> 02:17:27,830
Is there something about me that's
grading,

2866
02:17:27,831 --> 02:17:29,420
like what is a,
you know what I'm saying?

2867
02:17:29,450 --> 02:17:30,780
Like why did this happen?
Well,

2868
02:17:30,800 --> 02:17:35,090
you know what I said to you early in the
podcast where you can tell I go,

2869
02:17:35,180 --> 02:17:37,190
oh,
there's a podcast or is mine because

2870
02:17:37,191 --> 02:17:39,590
you're like worrying some people gonna
look at this.

2871
02:17:39,591 --> 02:17:41,210
They're going to approach it a certain
way.

2872
02:17:41,211 --> 02:17:44,210
Like you're constantly examining.
If you're trying to do a podcast,

2873
02:17:44,211 --> 02:17:46,010
you're trying constantly examining,
okay,

2874
02:17:46,011 --> 02:17:49,430
am I talking too much?
Is as boring as this repetitive,

2875
02:17:49,431 --> 02:17:52,460
like how do I juice this up?
How to make this exciting.

2876
02:17:53,270 --> 02:17:56,420
When you recovered from that and you're
like,

2877
02:17:56,421 --> 02:17:57,360
okay,
now I'm on my own.

2878
02:17:57,361 --> 02:18:00,090
Like,
does it make you tentative date?

2879
02:18:00,130 --> 02:18:00,891
Did you say,
okay,

2880
02:18:00,891 --> 02:18:04,220
okay,
I have to maybe be less bold or maybe

2881
02:18:04,221 --> 02:18:06,530
more cautious or maybe more aware.

2882
02:18:08,260 --> 02:18:11,140
I think that

2883
02:18:13,530 --> 02:18:18,530
all the extra attention that was on me
after it happened

2884
02:18:20,700 --> 02:18:25,700
made me
speak in the way that I'm speaking right

2885
02:18:25,711 --> 02:18:27,720
now,
which is super unnatural and really

2886
02:18:27,721 --> 02:18:30,420
halting and examining every word before
I say it.

2887
02:18:30,421 --> 02:18:31,260
You know,
it did,

2888
02:18:31,261 --> 02:18:33,030
it did.
Um,

2889
02:18:33,810 --> 02:18:36,000
because okay,
now I'm just going to talk about some of

2890
02:18:36,001 --> 02:18:39,540
it immediately afterwards when they were
all these people coming to people

2891
02:18:39,541 --> 02:18:41,040
tweeting at me like,
why didn't you do this?

2892
02:18:41,041 --> 02:18:41,811
Why didn't you do this?
Blah,

2893
02:18:41,811 --> 02:18:42,040
blah,
blah,

2894
02:18:42,040 --> 02:18:44,880
blah.
I wanted to set the record straight.

2895
02:18:45,330 --> 02:18:46,800
Um,
and someone that I,

2896
02:18:47,520 --> 02:18:52,200
a mentor that someone that I look up to
but who doesn't come from podcast and

2897
02:18:52,201 --> 02:18:56,820
you comes from old media was like,
don't take the bait allison,

2898
02:18:56,880 --> 02:18:59,190
don't do it.
Like when the dust settles,

2899
02:18:59,820 --> 02:19:03,660
do not get in there.
Just allow,

2900
02:19:03,690 --> 02:19:04,550
just be,
you know,

2901
02:19:04,560 --> 02:19:09,040
take the high road because everyone can
see what's happening today.

2902
02:19:09,330 --> 02:19:12,720
And it may like that night I had planned
to be like,

2903
02:19:12,721 --> 02:19:16,500
here's my side of the story,
here's my response to this,

2904
02:19:16,501 --> 02:19:17,171
to this,
to this,

2905
02:19:17,171 --> 02:19:20,070
to this.
Like I was going to get into it because

2906
02:19:20,180 --> 02:19:25,180
it,
there was so much untruth out there and

2907
02:19:27,291 --> 02:19:29,300
I had very simple like,
no this,

2908
02:19:29,301 --> 02:19:30,050
you know,
let me read,

2909
02:19:30,050 --> 02:19:31,850
here's the email,
here's what this said,

2910
02:19:31,851 --> 02:19:33,710
here's this.
This is not the way it went down.

2911
02:19:33,980 --> 02:19:36,350
You guys are getting,
are getting a distorted version of

2912
02:19:36,351 --> 02:19:39,710
things.
But then I listened to this guy and I

2913
02:19:39,711 --> 02:19:41,270
was like,
that makes a lot of sense,

2914
02:19:42,320 --> 02:19:47,320
so I am just going to say thank you for
the great time that I had on the show

2915
02:19:47,331 --> 02:19:52,331
and I wish you the best and I did that.
And then for the next two months I

2916
02:19:53,241 --> 02:19:58,241
chafed against that because it's like I
agree that that is a great position to

2917
02:19:59,361 --> 02:20:04,361
take,
but if you have an audience,

2918
02:20:04,640 --> 02:20:06,680
if you have a podcast,
that podcast,

2919
02:20:06,830 --> 02:20:08,300
depending on the kind of products you
have,

2920
02:20:08,301 --> 02:20:10,910
but for the most part it's predicated on
the relationship you have with the

2921
02:20:10,911 --> 02:20:14,390
listeners and the fact that you are
honest with them and you're transparent

2922
02:20:14,391 --> 02:20:15,830
and you're,
you're your authentic,

2923
02:20:15,831 --> 02:20:16,790
genuine self.

2924
02:20:17,030 --> 02:20:22,030
So all of a sUdden I did not know how to
be my authentic genuine self while also

2925
02:20:22,041 --> 02:20:26,870
trying to be like very to,
to not discuss this thing.

2926
02:20:26,871 --> 02:20:31,871
That was such a big thing obviously.
And so I was kind of like going

2927
02:20:32,421 --> 02:20:37,421
vacillate and going back and forth and,
and being authentic in every way other

2928
02:20:37,671 --> 02:20:39,800
than this one topic that I wasn't
talking about it.

2929
02:20:39,801 --> 02:20:40,590
And then it surprised,
like,

2930
02:20:40,590 --> 02:20:44,360
why am I not talking about it?
It feels so weird to not be talking

2931
02:20:44,361 --> 02:20:46,160
about it.
So then I finally did talk about it and

2932
02:20:46,161 --> 02:20:50,210
it was a couple months later,
um,

2933
02:20:51,080 --> 02:20:52,300
but even,
but,

2934
02:20:52,301 --> 02:20:54,020
and,
and that specifically is a thing where

2935
02:20:54,021 --> 02:20:56,030
I'm like,
I wish I had never said any of that

2936
02:20:56,180 --> 02:20:58,210
were talking though.
But you're,

2937
02:20:58,211 --> 02:20:59,400
you're talking,
arriving,

2938
02:20:59,480 --> 02:21:01,480
talking around it.
But even in doing so,

2939
02:21:01,481 --> 02:21:03,080
you're still discussing it.
Yeah.

2940
02:21:03,190 --> 02:21:05,530
You know,
you're spending an inordinate amount of

2941
02:21:05,531 --> 02:21:07,810
time like thinking about it and
discussing it.

2942
02:21:07,840 --> 02:21:10,540
Right?
So just mean you and I had discussed it

2943
02:21:10,580 --> 02:21:11,770
to,
you know,

2944
02:21:12,250 --> 02:21:14,770
my thoughts were pretty much the same,
just don't,

2945
02:21:15,130 --> 02:21:16,930
don't bother,
just kick ass,

2946
02:21:16,931 --> 02:21:18,610
go do your shit,
don't worry about it.

2947
02:21:18,880 --> 02:21:20,050
You know,
and people,

2948
02:21:20,140 --> 02:21:22,030
there's gonna be times where people just
don't.

2949
02:21:22,690 --> 02:21:24,700
That doesn't work.
It doesn't gel.

2950
02:21:24,880 --> 02:21:27,580
Maybe it jelled for you more than a job
for him.

2951
02:21:27,790 --> 02:21:30,310
Or maybe the opportunity was better for
you than it was for him.

2952
02:21:30,850 --> 02:21:31,960
You know,
it's,

2953
02:21:31,961 --> 02:21:33,910
um,
people shouldn't be forced to have to

2954
02:21:33,911 --> 02:21:35,520
work together,
especIally in show business.

2955
02:21:35,600 --> 02:21:37,440
I hundred percent agree with,
by the way,

2956
02:21:37,441 --> 02:21:41,910
in no way was I ever like this is he
shouldn't have made this decision.

2957
02:21:41,950 --> 02:21:43,300
Seems to marry,
you know,

2958
02:21:43,600 --> 02:21:45,760
was network though.
That doesn't make any sense.

2959
02:21:45,970 --> 02:21:49,120
That seems lIke there was something more
to it because if you guys stopped

2960
02:21:49,121 --> 02:21:52,360
working together and he just kept you on
his network and helped promote you and,

2961
02:21:52,361 --> 02:21:53,740
and pumped you up.
That seems.

2962
02:21:54,040 --> 02:21:56,800
That seems more amicable.
Like it makes sense.

2963
02:21:56,801 --> 02:21:57,350
It seems like.
So

2964
02:21:57,350 --> 02:21:59,690
what I'm saying,
that's what I'm saying about how it

2965
02:21:59,691 --> 02:22:04,691
didn't make sense to me is like,
there he is pissed and I don't know why

2966
02:22:06,070 --> 02:22:07,020
we're going to do.
Yeah.

2967
02:22:08,240 --> 02:22:10,690
Do your own show.
That's what I think.

2968
02:22:10,730 --> 02:22:12,640
I'll start doing that.
You've already been doing this.

2969
02:22:13,250 --> 02:22:15,230
How's it going?
It's going really well.

2970
02:22:15,250 --> 02:22:17,000
Do you want it twice a week.
Twice a week.

2971
02:22:17,330 --> 02:22:22,330
Monday a one-on-one and thursday is,
there's a panel of us and it's going

2972
02:22:22,431 --> 02:22:25,770
really well and I really like it.
And um,

2973
02:22:25,771 --> 02:22:27,760
yeah,
everything's good to go.

2974
02:22:28,070 --> 02:22:30,870
Just don't worry about it.
I'm not worrying about it.

2975
02:22:31,260 --> 02:22:33,750
But you are because you talked about it
right.

2976
02:22:34,050 --> 02:22:36,570
When I talk about it,
I worry about the fact that I just

2977
02:22:36,571 --> 02:22:40,440
talked about it and I can't.
I can't get to the bottom of why that

2978
02:22:40,441 --> 02:22:40,951
is.
I mean,

2979
02:22:40,951 --> 02:22:42,870
like I said before,
I think it's because I'm up different

2980
02:22:42,871 --> 02:22:46,740
minds about it,
but it might just be because there's so

2981
02:22:46,741 --> 02:22:51,360
much immediate online response.
Anytime I dance around it,

2982
02:22:51,400 --> 02:22:54,880
that's one of the more difficult things
about anything that you're putting out

2983
02:22:54,881 --> 02:22:58,190
there,
whether it's a talk show or a podcast or

2984
02:22:58,210 --> 02:23:03,210
fucking even an album or anything.
It's the navigating the response and the

2985
02:23:03,761 --> 02:23:06,940
social media response is just so
different than the response that you

2986
02:23:06,941 --> 02:23:10,990
would have gotten a few decades ago or a
decade ago.

2987
02:23:11,080 --> 02:23:12,220
It's just,
it's so different.

2988
02:23:12,221 --> 02:23:15,430
It's a different world and no one knows
exactly how to handle it.

2989
02:23:15,460 --> 02:23:17,170
Right.
I mean they can give you really good

2990
02:23:17,171 --> 02:23:18,850
advice,
but no one's done it.

2991
02:23:19,060 --> 02:23:19,890
No one said,
well,

2992
02:23:19,890 --> 02:23:22,420
in the 30 years of my career when
twitter came along,

2993
02:23:22,421 --> 02:23:25,660
you know,
they don't really have that to say so

2994
02:23:26,650 --> 02:23:30,790
you can eat in the paralysis by analysis
that you were.

2995
02:23:31,120 --> 02:23:33,400
Yeah.
We were just talking about fighting

2996
02:23:33,401 --> 02:23:34,710
term.
You know,

2997
02:23:34,750 --> 02:23:37,690
like you analyze things too much when
you're fighting and you freeze up,

2998
02:23:37,730 --> 02:23:41,500
you don't know what to do.
He hesitates is lost you.

2999
02:23:41,501 --> 02:23:45,520
So when you,
you're unfortunately incapable of being

3000
02:23:45,521 --> 02:23:47,290
yourself because you worried about
criticism.

3001
02:23:47,650 --> 02:23:50,950
That's also something that clients want.
They want,

3002
02:23:51,160 --> 02:23:54,130
they want to be able to fuck with you to
the point where I see her,

3003
02:23:54,340 --> 02:23:55,960
you know,
allIson reads my tweets,

3004
02:23:55,961 --> 02:24:00,520
I see words,
but what she says no because me and then

3005
02:24:00,521 --> 02:24:01,240
they like,
yeah,

3006
02:24:01,240 --> 02:24:02,920
good,
good job on rogan's podcast.

3007
02:24:02,921 --> 02:24:05,530
You fucking dumb bitch.
Talk about yourself much.

3008
02:24:07,410 --> 02:24:10,240
Oh,
and then you think about that the next

3009
02:24:10,241 --> 02:24:12,370
time you talk and then they creep into
your head and

3010
02:24:12,430 --> 02:24:15,880
that's why I tried to not expose the to
the degree that I can.

3011
02:24:15,881 --> 02:24:18,570
I try not to expose myself to it because
I,

3012
02:24:18,640 --> 02:24:23,640
I think to myself,
this is not helping me to do any,

3013
02:24:24,010 --> 02:24:27,550
to be good at anything.
This is not making a better show when I

3014
02:24:27,551 --> 02:24:30,310
do my own show.
This is making me concerned that these

3015
02:24:30,311 --> 02:24:32,650
18 ads are upset with something.
You know?

3016
02:24:33,040 --> 02:24:38,020
It can give you a different perspective.
Occasionally someone can say something

3017
02:24:38,021 --> 02:24:40,990
that will eliminate some aspects of your
own behavior that maybe you weren't

3018
02:24:40,991 --> 02:24:45,250
aware of that as possible,
but it's also possible that you can tap

3019
02:24:45,251 --> 02:24:50,251
into a river of cons and just drown
and you can also use you because I've

3020
02:24:51,671 --> 02:24:56,671
swum in those rivers swam spanner.
Did you see that video that I posted the

3021
02:24:56,680 --> 02:25:01,060
other day about one of the most
dangerous rivers in the world and it's

3022
02:25:01,061 --> 02:25:03,640
insanely deceptive.
I tweeted it yesterday.

3023
02:25:03,641 --> 02:25:08,560
I believe this is crazy.
There's this place in england and it's

3024
02:25:08,561 --> 02:25:12,220
this river that if you look at it,
it looks like a calm,

3025
02:25:12,310 --> 02:25:17,020
just sort of meandering river just
doesn't like anything exceptional,

3026
02:25:17,021 --> 02:25:20,530
but the way it's cut into the,
to the ground,

3027
02:25:20,740 --> 02:25:23,200
what you're seeing is not the entire
river.

3028
02:25:23,440 --> 02:25:28,440
There's an underlying aspect of it with
torrential currents.

3029
02:25:28,900 --> 02:25:31,780
So if you get stuck in it,
if you go in it,

3030
02:25:31,810 --> 02:25:33,220
you literally can't escape.

3031
02:25:33,310 --> 02:25:36,250
Did you get smashed up against the rocks
and you get killed?

3032
02:25:36,430 --> 02:25:36,790
Like,
here,

3033
02:25:36,790 --> 02:25:38,470
play this.
It looks so plastic.

3034
02:25:38,471 --> 02:25:39,830
Let this play,
uh,

3035
02:25:39,831 --> 02:25:43,190
jimmy,
it is the most dangerous stretch of

3036
02:25:43,191 --> 02:25:45,870
water anywhere on earth.
How crazy is that?

3037
02:25:45,871 --> 02:25:49,500
It's a bold claim.
What's the name of this video?

3038
02:25:49,501 --> 02:25:54,030
Lives and never rapids and the most
dangerous stretch of water in the world.

3039
02:25:54,390 --> 02:25:56,120
This is treated.
Is that what it says?

3040
02:25:56,610 --> 02:25:58,860
Straight up street in bolton.
Some woods.

3041
02:25:58,861 --> 02:26:01,170
You could jump over.
People occasionally do,

3042
02:26:01,200 --> 02:26:03,990
but if you miss that jump,
it'll kill you.

3043
02:26:04,830 --> 02:26:07,800
This is what the rIver looks like about
100 meters upstream,

3044
02:26:08,010 --> 02:26:11,310
same river.
All that water went down thanks to the

3045
02:26:11,311 --> 02:26:14,430
local geology.
The river basically turns on its side,

3046
02:26:15,080 --> 02:26:17,640
help passages and tunnels in the rocks
below.

3047
02:26:18,060 --> 02:26:22,080
Those banks are actually overhangs.
There isn't any riverbed just belOw the

3048
02:26:22,081 --> 02:26:26,250
surface.
It's a deep boiling mass of fast and

3049
02:26:26,251 --> 02:26:27,450
deadly currents.

3050
02:26:28,590 --> 02:26:31,860
There were claims that falling in has a
100 percent fatality rate.

3051
02:26:32,150 --> 02:26:33,810
Uh,
there's no way to confirm that,

3052
02:26:33,960 --> 02:26:36,690
of course,
because a local person doesn't die and

3053
02:26:36,691 --> 02:26:38,260
river doesn't make the news.
But,

3054
02:26:38,261 --> 02:26:40,940
uh,
it has claimed a lot of lives there.

3055
02:26:40,960 --> 02:26:45,390
Even tales from the twelfth century of
young boy said to be the future king of

3056
02:26:45,391 --> 02:26:50,391
scotland who died trying to jump across
those waters on anything or anyone that

3057
02:26:50,761 --> 02:26:53,850
falls in might not come out in any
recognizable form.

3058
02:26:54,150 --> 02:26:59,150
It could just get polarized against the
rocks and the water over and over and

3059
02:26:59,521 --> 02:27:01,260
over again.
That's fine.

3060
02:27:01,360 --> 02:27:04,050
put a cameron,
but then I'd have to get close to the

3061
02:27:04,051 --> 02:27:08,790
edge and the edge isn't sharp.
It just cubs towards the water and it's

3062
02:27:08,850 --> 02:27:13,140
covered in slippery moss.
Besides the mortar is opaque and brown

3063
02:27:13,141 --> 02:27:16,950
with pit stain,
you'd see nothing it survivable.

3064
02:27:17,490 --> 02:27:20,070
It's one of those things where you
really have to look at it,

3065
02:27:20,071 --> 02:27:22,860
so people listening to this go and check
out the video.

3066
02:27:22,860 --> 02:27:23,880
What is it?
Is it on vimeo?

3067
02:27:23,910 --> 02:27:25,530
What is it on your tongue?
Youtube.

3068
02:27:26,460 --> 02:27:29,310
The videos.
Much better representation because what

3069
02:27:29,311 --> 02:27:33,540
they do is they show you what the river
looks like at its widest part,

3070
02:27:33,541 --> 02:27:37,020
which is enormous,
and then it cuts down into a small area

3071
02:27:37,021 --> 02:27:41,670
that you can jump across and it's so
much water rolling through such a small

3072
02:27:41,671 --> 02:27:46,671
area that it creates this intense
current and just fucking bizarre,

3073
02:27:46,741 --> 02:27:48,960
right?
It's like an optical illusion because it

3074
02:27:48,961 --> 02:27:50,880
just feels like a stream that looks like
enough.

3075
02:27:51,600 --> 02:27:56,370
Meanwhile it'S super deep and raging
beneath it and you just can't.

3076
02:27:56,371 --> 02:28:01,371
The subconscious
deep river of cons,

3077
02:28:04,410 --> 02:28:07,680
but you know,
and that's like in a lot of ways it's

3078
02:28:07,681 --> 02:28:09,930
what you're dealing with and now we got
to that,

3079
02:28:09,990 --> 02:28:10,830
but that's where it was.
Right?

3080
02:28:10,860 --> 02:28:13,110
River of cons.
That's what we were talking about.

3081
02:28:14,190 --> 02:28:15,340
Even for them,
you know,

3082
02:28:15,990 --> 02:28:18,300
the people that are doing that,
a lot of times they don't even realize

3083
02:28:18,630 --> 02:28:22,850
the harm they're doing to themselves in
their own psyche by just lashing out of

3084
02:28:22,851 --> 02:28:23,450
people.

3085
02:28:23,450 --> 02:28:25,280
I went to,
this guy's a page yesterday.

3086
02:28:25,790 --> 02:28:29,990
he was tweeting at someone I know really
negative shit and I went to his page and

3087
02:28:29,991 --> 02:28:34,550
his entire twitter page,
which is him shitting on various famous

3088
02:28:34,551 --> 02:28:39,551
people and trying to get them to respond
to him like what a bizarre life and also

3089
02:28:41,100 --> 02:28:43,520
the water.
It's got to be incredibly damaging to

3090
02:28:43,521 --> 02:28:47,510
your self esteem,
to be just constantly lashing out at

3091
02:28:47,511 --> 02:28:50,690
famous people and trying to get them tO
respond to you.

3092
02:28:50,691 --> 02:28:53,240
Just trying to insult them,
trying to troll them.

3093
02:28:54,240 --> 02:28:59,240
So bizarre always makes me wonder,
is it young people?

3094
02:28:59,511 --> 02:29:03,440
Is it like people who are in that phase
of life where you're young and you're

3095
02:29:03,441 --> 02:29:05,850
angry?
Some of them you just need an outlet.

3096
02:29:06,410 --> 02:29:07,070
Some of them,
yeah,

3097
02:29:07,070 --> 02:29:10,250
some of them were older men.
Some of it's men.

3098
02:29:10,251 --> 02:29:13,010
You know,
like if you ever ran into a man who's in

3099
02:29:13,011 --> 02:29:14,530
his fifties,
never had a family,

3100
02:29:14,560 --> 02:29:17,600
never been married.
There's a weirdness to those folks.

3101
02:29:18,170 --> 02:29:20,990
There's a real weirdness to these older
set in their ways.

3102
02:29:20,991 --> 02:29:24,470
Guys that never really settled down with
anybody.

3103
02:29:25,010 --> 02:29:26,840
You will run into him oCcasionally and
you're like,

3104
02:29:26,841 --> 02:29:27,740
whoa,
there's like you,

3105
02:29:28,110 --> 02:29:30,230
you,
you're surviving without a heart.

3106
02:29:30,410 --> 02:29:31,330
Like you're,
you know what I mean,

3107
02:29:31,340 --> 02:29:34,610
like when one of these people that's
your missing organs or something like

3108
02:29:34,611 --> 02:29:37,340
that,
you're missing a critical aspect of what

3109
02:29:37,341 --> 02:29:38,360
it means to be a person.

3110
02:29:38,520 --> 02:29:40,590
Right.
I noticed,

3111
02:29:41,010 --> 02:29:43,200
um,
a fair amount of,

3112
02:29:43,860 --> 02:29:48,480
of hate that I was getting.
This is years ago,

3113
02:29:48,481 --> 02:29:52,560
I had noticed a pattern that I would
oftentimes discover,

3114
02:29:52,620 --> 02:29:55,140
like I would,
I would get some shitty comment and then

3115
02:29:55,141 --> 02:30:00,141
I would go to the person's page and they
had a newborn and it was like a lot of

3116
02:30:00,811 --> 02:30:05,811
brand new dads and that really surprised
me that like it's brand new dads who are

3117
02:30:05,851 --> 02:30:08,100
writing shitty things.
Yeah.

3118
02:30:08,550 --> 02:30:10,530
Um,
and my husband's theory is like,

3119
02:30:10,531 --> 02:30:12,330
yeah,
because they're not getting sex so.

3120
02:30:13,110 --> 02:30:14,310
Well,
that's a weird theory.

3121
02:30:15,520 --> 02:30:17,660
They're tired,
I would say.

3122
02:30:18,510 --> 02:30:19,740
I mean,
I think his theory,

3123
02:30:20,010 --> 02:30:24,570
yes,
they're tired and there's been this huge

3124
02:30:24,571 --> 02:30:26,040
change in their relationship

3125
02:30:26,210 --> 02:30:28,940
or they're just assholes and the baby
didn't cure it.

3126
02:30:30,590 --> 02:30:33,290
The thing that was most overwhelming to
me,

3127
02:30:33,930 --> 02:30:37,910
I'm having a baby was like how
compassion I felt for other people.

3128
02:30:38,180 --> 02:30:39,290
How I felt like,
oh,

3129
02:30:39,291 --> 02:30:40,730
these other people that are all fucked
up,

3130
02:30:40,731 --> 02:30:44,480
or just babies,
they were babies that were just exposed

3131
02:30:44,481 --> 02:30:47,480
to the wrong stimuli,
the wrong life,

3132
02:30:47,481 --> 02:30:49,970
the wrong emotions,
the wrong family,

3133
02:30:49,971 --> 02:30:54,971
the wrong schools.
And then here you are a raging twat at

3134
02:30:55,491 --> 02:30:56,740
30,
you know,

3135
02:30:56,780 --> 02:30:58,250
that's a lot of human beings.
I mean,

3136
02:30:58,251 --> 02:31:01,040
we're essentially long running
equations.

3137
02:31:01,340 --> 02:31:05,720
All of our life experiences and
interactions calculated to alison rosen.

3138
02:31:05,750 --> 02:31:06,920
Two thousand 16.
I mean,

3139
02:31:06,921 --> 02:31:09,710
that's really what it is.
It's why it's why it's interesting when

3140
02:31:09,711 --> 02:31:13,730
you sit here and you tell me about your
life experience,

3141
02:31:13,731 --> 02:31:14,640
you know,
born in,

3142
02:31:14,660 --> 02:31:16,820
you know,
oakland moving to orange county.

3143
02:31:16,821 --> 02:31:17,780
I gotta get outta here.

3144
02:31:17,780 --> 02:31:19,040
I'm in a band,
but I'm going to leave.

3145
02:31:19,170 --> 02:31:21,080
I'm in New York and you know,
and then did,

3146
02:31:21,081 --> 02:31:21,481
did,
did,

3147
02:31:21,481 --> 02:31:26,100
did all these different interactions and
different engagements.

3148
02:31:26,101 --> 02:31:29,070
And then boom,
now you're here and you are the sum

3149
02:31:29,071 --> 02:31:33,120
total of these experiences and your
reflections on these experiences.

3150
02:31:33,480 --> 02:31:37,710
And it's one of the reasons why people
that have lived fucked up lives are the

3151
02:31:37,711 --> 02:31:41,000
most interesting.
and people that have these mundane self

3152
02:31:41,001 --> 02:31:45,990
absorbed existences are the most boring
because they really haven't had the

3153
02:31:45,991 --> 02:31:48,960
trials and tribulations.
I really haven't had those moments where

3154
02:31:48,961 --> 02:31:51,270
they had to question themselves and try
to figure out what the fuck they're

3155
02:31:51,271 --> 02:31:55,560
doing with themselves that when you do
that and you hit those low points and

3156
02:31:55,561 --> 02:31:58,800
then rebound,
that's where life's lessons happen.

3157
02:31:58,920 --> 02:32:01,020
I agree.
And it's kind of weird as a parent

3158
02:32:01,021 --> 02:32:03,540
because I don't want my kids to face
adversity.

3159
02:32:03,541 --> 02:32:05,640
You know,
I want my kids have a really fun time.

3160
02:32:05,850 --> 02:32:10,850
But I also know that unless they do,
unless they do face disappointment and

3161
02:32:11,850 --> 02:32:13,650
some adversity,
at least some,

3162
02:32:14,190 --> 02:32:19,190
they're not going to get a full,
full handle on how to manage those

3163
02:32:20,041 --> 02:32:21,360
waters.
You know,

3164
02:32:21,700 --> 02:32:24,760
do fall into the river of cons.
Don't know what to do.

3165
02:32:25,260 --> 02:32:27,820
So like I swim in the river of freely

3166
02:32:28,330 --> 02:32:31,960
been around them for so long.
Now it's know you're not gonna fuck with

3167
02:32:31,961 --> 02:32:36,961
my zen that easy.
But if I lived an entire entirely

3168
02:32:37,391 --> 02:32:41,200
sheltered life,
how much of how much my resilience would

3169
02:32:41,201 --> 02:32:42,220
I have,
you know?

3170
02:32:42,221 --> 02:32:47,221
And how much resilience do people have
where they don't experience life outside

3171
02:32:47,321 --> 02:32:51,430
of their very small existence.
They're very small community.

3172
02:32:51,431 --> 02:32:54,940
they're very small pattern of life
experiences.

3173
02:32:55,330 --> 02:32:59,470
Right?
That Is that sort of letting my kids go

3174
02:32:59,471 --> 02:33:02,650
through adversity.
ThAt part I know is going to be hard for

3175
02:33:02,651 --> 02:33:06,280
me because I'm the kind of person where
like if there's someone in the corner

3176
02:33:06,281 --> 02:33:07,091
that has an itch,
I'm like,

3177
02:33:07,091 --> 02:33:08,470
let me come over and scratch it for you
though.

3178
02:33:08,471 --> 02:33:11,920
I don't want you to feel discomfort.
Like I'm very tuned into.

3179
02:33:11,921 --> 02:33:14,440
I mean,
are you going to be a helicopter parent?

3180
02:33:14,800 --> 02:33:16,300
Got to hope not.
I don't.

3181
02:33:16,640 --> 02:33:19,240
Just women when they,
when they have children later in life,

3182
02:33:19,241 --> 02:33:21,490
that's when they're most likely to
helicopter.

3183
02:33:22,150 --> 02:33:24,100
There's a lot of helicopter parents at
my kid's school.

3184
02:33:24,370 --> 02:33:28,810
I probably will be.
I want to be the right level of

3185
02:33:28,811 --> 02:33:33,811
helicopter parent to like keep my kids
safe and I'm happy but not fuck them up

3186
02:33:35,591 --> 02:33:37,280
wIth being smothering.
Right.

3187
02:33:37,550 --> 02:33:38,231
Tod,
it's going to be.

3188
02:33:38,231 --> 02:33:41,290
The challenge for me I think is tough
action.

3189
02:33:41,660 --> 02:33:42,850
It's,
it's interesting.

3190
02:33:42,910 --> 02:33:46,210
Everybody does it different and kids
come out different.

3191
02:33:47,510 --> 02:33:51,740
Then there's also like my two kids are
so fucking dissembler there,

3192
02:33:51,750 --> 02:33:56,750
so dissembler there's age difference.
One of them is almost seven or one of

3193
02:33:57,251 --> 02:33:59,230
them is actually just turned eight
rather,

3194
02:33:59,231 --> 02:34:02,680
and one of them is almost six,
so out of the box,

3195
02:34:02,920 --> 02:34:05,980
the six year old is the one who eats
candy and becomes a barbarian.

3196
02:34:06,550 --> 02:34:07,860
She's so much depth.
She'll.

3197
02:34:08,060 --> 02:34:10,960
She's six soon,
but she's so much different than her

3198
02:34:10,961 --> 02:34:15,190
sister is.
They're just so different and they grew

3199
02:34:15,191 --> 02:34:19,480
up in the same loving,
same amount of attention,

3200
02:34:19,600 --> 02:34:21,940
same amount of resources,
you know,

3201
02:34:21,941 --> 02:34:24,790
obviously slightly different life
experiences can be no different.

3202
02:34:24,791 --> 02:34:25,810
Of course,
different friends,

3203
02:34:25,840 --> 02:34:28,960
different things,
but it's not just that it's the innate

3204
02:34:28,961 --> 02:34:32,110
personality,
like they come out of the box different.

3205
02:34:32,580 --> 02:34:33,840
well,
that's something I wonder.

3206
02:34:33,841 --> 02:34:36,810
I mean,
when you're saying that sitting here,

3207
02:34:36,930 --> 02:34:39,480
I'm the sum total of everything I've
experienced.

3208
02:34:39,840 --> 02:34:42,860
Yes,
but I also think how much is just

3209
02:34:42,861 --> 02:34:45,460
genetic counseling there too.
yeah.

3210
02:34:45,580 --> 02:34:48,640
It's also the variabilities,
like there's,

3211
02:34:48,730 --> 02:34:51,430
it's not just genetics that are
variable.

3212
02:34:51,431 --> 02:34:54,130
It's like those genetics very,
you know,

3213
02:34:54,131 --> 02:34:57,490
like brothers and sisters are different
in some parents.

3214
02:34:57,860 --> 02:35:01,080
I'm wondering what the combination is
like how much of your husband is going

3215
02:35:01,081 --> 02:35:05,140
to be in your kid and how much of it's
you and is it a 50 slash 50 split,

3216
02:35:05,250 --> 02:35:07,200
right?
Or do your and how much of that other

3217
02:35:07,201 --> 02:35:08,034
guy?
Yeah.

3218
02:35:08,700 --> 02:35:11,190
And do your jeans just dominate is like,
you know,

3219
02:35:11,220 --> 02:35:15,090
ever seen like a person who's blond
haired and blue eyed and if the kid

3220
02:35:15,091 --> 02:35:16,560
doesn't look anything like them,
like oh,

3221
02:35:16,561 --> 02:35:20,580
you just get your genes got dominated by
the other genes.

3222
02:35:20,670 --> 02:35:21,420
Right.
I don't know.

3223
02:35:21,420 --> 02:35:22,650
It's,
it's interesting.

3224
02:35:22,680 --> 02:35:25,290
My sister who has the same coloring as I
do,

3225
02:35:25,320 --> 02:35:28,920
has a blonde blue eyed baby was so
weird.

3226
02:35:29,130 --> 02:35:30,760
Her husband,
his is blonde and blue eyed,

3227
02:35:30,770 --> 02:35:34,980
but it's like I just,
I just believed that the dark jeans

3228
02:35:34,981 --> 02:35:38,540
would dominate and they did not fighting
jeans to go over.

3229
02:35:38,550 --> 02:35:39,690
I guess.
So yeah,

3230
02:35:39,960 --> 02:35:42,480
it can happen.
It's interesting

3231
02:35:42,660 --> 02:35:44,490
also,
not just that,

3232
02:35:44,580 --> 02:35:47,760
like the genetic variables which which
are are,

3233
02:35:47,820 --> 02:35:50,910
are truly fascinating personality
variables,

3234
02:35:50,911 --> 02:35:55,911
all these different things,
but also how they interact with each

3235
02:35:56,041 --> 02:35:58,530
other,
which is going to be so much different

3236
02:35:58,531 --> 02:36:01,560
than how you interact with them and
watching kids interact with each other

3237
02:36:01,561 --> 02:36:04,950
and getting annoyed at each other and
trying to work that out and what

3238
02:36:04,951 --> 02:36:08,640
watching their own little personality
disputes that they have and how they

3239
02:36:08,641 --> 02:36:11,280
navigate those and little tools they
have.

3240
02:36:11,281 --> 02:36:13,510
Like my,
my youngest one cries at everything.

3241
02:36:13,630 --> 02:36:18,630
Everything's like to like,
like go way overboard and settle down,

3242
02:36:19,360 --> 02:36:20,610
relax,
you know,

3243
02:36:20,760 --> 02:36:24,690
because they figure out like if I cry I
get hugs and someone picks me up and so

3244
02:36:24,691 --> 02:36:26,550
that's the move.
So anything that goes wrong,

3245
02:36:26,551 --> 02:36:28,330
I'm just gonna start crying.
So like I'll,

3246
02:36:28,360 --> 02:36:30,390
I'll watch her,
like she'll do something wrong,

3247
02:36:30,570 --> 02:36:34,920
her sister will get pissed at you at her
and then she'll run away crying that her

3248
02:36:34,921 --> 02:36:36,010
sister did something like,
whoa,

3249
02:36:36,020 --> 02:36:36,610
whoa,
whoa,

3250
02:36:36,610 --> 02:36:37,443
whoa,
hold on.

3251
02:36:37,800 --> 02:36:40,260
I just watched it.
I watched that whole thing go down.

3252
02:36:40,261 --> 02:36:43,680
That's not how it went.
And then the cries.

3253
02:36:43,681 --> 02:36:47,010
Okay.
Bigger and so it becomes like you don't

3254
02:36:47,011 --> 02:36:51,240
want your kid to be a cry baby.
You also want your kid to recognize that

3255
02:36:51,241 --> 02:36:55,620
you know exactly when or what went on,
but you also want to let them know that

3256
02:36:55,621 --> 02:36:59,550
it's okay.
So that's where I've always gone to the.

3257
02:36:59,551 --> 02:37:03,120
I did the exact same thing when I was
your age and I think that's a big one.

3258
02:37:03,121 --> 02:37:05,220
Like letting them know and then,
you know,

3259
02:37:05,221 --> 02:37:07,560
not letting it go to no,
no harp on it.

3260
02:37:07,770 --> 02:37:08,603
Sled it,
go,

3261
02:37:08,680 --> 02:37:09,271
all right,
come on,

3262
02:37:09,271 --> 02:37:11,280
give me a hug,
let's go play with some stuff like let

3263
02:37:11,281 --> 02:37:13,230
it go because they,
they learn themselves,

3264
02:37:13,231 --> 02:37:15,350
they see themselves that things don't
work.

3265
02:37:15,620 --> 02:37:17,360
They see themselves,
they got called out on their

3266
02:37:17,361 --> 02:37:18,290
manipulation.
Like,

3267
02:37:18,320 --> 02:37:20,680
oh,
I got my fucking ran my crying game and

3268
02:37:20,681 --> 02:37:25,340
I shut down today,
but no one's getting mad,

3269
02:37:25,430 --> 02:37:27,920
you know?
So it's not like I'm a terrible person.

3270
02:37:27,921 --> 02:37:30,650
I need to feel awful,
but crying gained don't work on daddy.

3271
02:37:30,770 --> 02:37:32,870
I like that.
The idea that the stakes aren't that

3272
02:37:32,871 --> 02:37:35,450
high.
I think I grew up with the feeling at

3273
02:37:35,451 --> 02:37:40,040
all times and that the stakes were very
high and I,

3274
02:37:40,041 --> 02:37:43,940
you know,
I have parents who have that the stakes

3275
02:37:43,941 --> 02:37:46,340
are high attitude towards everything
where it's like,

3276
02:37:46,341 --> 02:37:47,174
this is this,
this,

3277
02:37:47,210 --> 02:37:50,690
the stakes are very low here,
but they're just very,

3278
02:37:50,691 --> 02:37:55,691
you know,
prone to anxiety and prone to a

3279
02:37:56,661 --> 02:37:57,620
overreacting

3280
02:37:57,790 --> 02:38:02,790
people.
So it's also those stakes are entirely

3281
02:38:03,221 --> 02:38:05,770
dependent upon like what are,
what's,

3282
02:38:05,860 --> 02:38:08,890
what's the full extent of the
possibilities of things can go right or

3283
02:38:08,891 --> 02:38:09,470
wrong,

3284
02:38:09,470 --> 02:38:09,920
right?
Like,

3285
02:38:09,920 --> 02:38:13,010
whaT's the worst that could happen?
And if it's not a big deal then.

3286
02:38:13,011 --> 02:38:13,844
So it happens.

3287
02:38:14,010 --> 02:38:16,110
Just you'll fix it.
Right?

3288
02:38:16,111 --> 02:38:18,450
But it's a perspective issue.
If you're living in the Congo,

3289
02:38:18,590 --> 02:38:20,760
whatever issue came up wouldn't come up
at all.

3290
02:38:20,870 --> 02:38:23,430
Like I guarantee you these people that
are like trying to find water,

3291
02:38:23,431 --> 02:38:24,990
don't look at their nose and go,
god,

3292
02:38:24,991 --> 02:38:27,690
I've got to figure out a way to get out
of the Congo and get to beverly hills.

3293
02:38:27,930 --> 02:38:30,860
Get my fucking nose fixed.
My nose.

3294
02:38:31,380 --> 02:38:33,600
Not talking about your nose,
my nose.

3295
02:38:33,620 --> 02:38:35,550
Nope.
I'm talking about Congo person's nose.

3296
02:38:35,551 --> 02:38:36,384
You're just making it.

3297
02:38:36,440 --> 02:38:39,380
You're tAlking about my nose and I get
what you're saying.

3298
02:38:39,381 --> 02:38:43,130
You're telling me that you think I
should get plastic surgery I think gets

3299
02:38:43,210 --> 02:38:45,420
you this.
That's what I'm getting from them.

3300
02:38:45,570 --> 02:38:46,260
I felt like

3301
02:38:46,260 --> 02:38:48,240
the entire time I was on joe rogan's
podcast,

3302
02:38:48,241 --> 02:38:52,290
he was judging my nose and I don't want
to talk about it but I don't want to

3303
02:38:52,291 --> 02:38:54,660
talk about it.
So it's like one of those things

3304
02:38:55,080 --> 02:38:59,110
I feel like I could say too much or sued
simultaneously on one.

3305
02:38:59,190 --> 02:39:01,950
Thank you.
Thank you for talking about my nose.

3306
02:39:02,010 --> 02:39:04,500
But hey,
I didn't like the way you've talked

3307
02:39:04,501 --> 02:39:07,080
about my nose.
The fucking entire podcast was a thinly

3308
02:39:07,081 --> 02:39:11,190
veiled slight at my nose.
I mean he asked me to go online and

3309
02:39:11,191 --> 02:39:14,190
people are tweeting me half truths about
my nose.

3310
02:39:14,340 --> 02:39:15,150
You know what to do.
We're going to do.

3311
02:39:15,150 --> 02:39:18,660
They're going to subtly photoshop your
nose just slightly bigger and you know,

3312
02:39:18,670 --> 02:39:19,770
look at the picture like,
oh my god,

3313
02:39:19,771 --> 02:39:21,420
do I look like that?
And then you're going to go to the

3314
02:39:21,421 --> 02:39:22,530
bathroom and look at your notes.
Go,

3315
02:39:22,531 --> 02:39:23,700
what the fuck?
Well,

3316
02:39:23,701 --> 02:39:26,130
thank you for giving them this bang up
idea.

3317
02:39:26,910 --> 02:39:31,910
Well I know this guy who photoshops is
radio personality and he takes them and

3318
02:39:32,701 --> 02:39:35,610
he does like these subtle weird things
to his face.

3319
02:39:35,850 --> 02:39:40,850
He makes his teeth bigger and make some
bolder and he makes his hands smaller

3320
02:39:41,490 --> 02:39:45,240
and he makes his shoulders like more
narrow but just slightly.

3321
02:39:45,510 --> 02:39:49,590
When you look at him you go fuck is
going on with them and this and it

3322
02:39:49,640 --> 02:39:52,740
drives the radio guy.
I think probably crazy.

3323
02:39:52,800 --> 02:39:55,710
Does he know that the guys doing it
though or is he just thinks that he's

3324
02:39:55,711 --> 02:39:57,400
becoming disproportionate?

3325
02:39:57,410 --> 02:39:59,640
I think you know.
Well some of the pictures of the guys

3326
02:39:59,641 --> 02:40:03,500
more obvious and some of them is more
subtle but it's the.

3327
02:40:03,540 --> 02:40:06,970
But the fact that that's not what he
really looks like that.

3328
02:40:06,971 --> 02:40:11,460
But the fact that someone could take
what you look like and make it different

3329
02:40:11,610 --> 02:40:14,130
but just slightly but just will fuck
with you.

3330
02:40:14,640 --> 02:40:16,800
That's weird.
It's weird.

3331
02:40:17,760 --> 02:40:20,220
It's weird that you know,
your ears aren't too big,

3332
02:40:20,221 --> 02:40:22,830
but if somebody like stretches your ears
I just a little bit and makes them poke

3333
02:40:22,831 --> 02:40:25,530
out of your hair.
What the fuck is going on in my ears?

3334
02:40:25,680 --> 02:40:29,640
like that's the photoshop thing is a
weird thing.

3335
02:40:30,630 --> 02:40:33,030
It's weird that people could do that.
It's also weird that people use it to

3336
02:40:33,031 --> 02:40:35,800
manipulate their own image.
Face tuning.

3337
02:40:36,090 --> 02:40:39,800
Male comedian who,
who smooths hIs skin out and does it

3338
02:40:39,840 --> 02:40:44,730
like a glamour filter on a bad fake as
fuck.

3339
02:40:44,850 --> 02:40:47,170
It looks bizarre.
Like super bowl.

3340
02:40:47,210 --> 02:40:48,960
And then you see them In real life like,
hey,

3341
02:40:49,780 --> 02:40:51,880
where the fuck what did you have?
Chicken pox.

3342
02:40:51,881 --> 02:40:56,881
And last tIme I saw your photos.
She gonna fight with a fucking salt gun.

3343
02:40:58,530 --> 02:41:00,330
I think um,
those,

3344
02:41:00,560 --> 02:41:04,240
those things,
the ability to manipulate faces and the,

3345
02:41:04,250 --> 02:41:08,310
the photoshop thing and what they do to
models where they're thin out their ways

3346
02:41:08,311 --> 02:41:10,630
and wiping butts and you know,
if you've seen those,

3347
02:41:10,840 --> 02:41:15,840
those reality versus the photoshop
images overwhelming has changed.

3348
02:41:16,291 --> 02:41:18,630
and then I wish I could remember what I
was watching,

3349
02:41:18,631 --> 02:41:21,600
but it was something where they were
showing that they can do this to moving

3350
02:41:21,601 --> 02:41:23,670
images.
So movies,

3351
02:41:23,671 --> 02:41:25,650
you know,
like they showed the real version of the

3352
02:41:25,660 --> 02:41:29,100
actress in whatever movie versus what
you saw on screen.

3353
02:41:29,101 --> 02:41:32,670
And it was sort of the equivalent of the
photo shopped magazine cover.

3354
02:41:32,880 --> 02:41:34,560
Yeah,
I mean we're going to get to a point

3355
02:41:34,620 --> 02:41:39,620
very soon where actors are unnecessary
because if you look at some of the

3356
02:41:39,990 --> 02:41:42,630
incredible cgi that they're able to do
now,

3357
02:41:42,631 --> 02:41:43,320
where they're,
they're,

3358
02:41:43,320 --> 02:41:46,860
they're so close to absolutely
recreating a human being.

3359
02:41:47,310 --> 02:41:52,310
They're not going to need actors,
maybe voiceover actors to just even that

3360
02:41:52,321 --> 02:41:56,010
maybe they'll get to their point where
they're visual or audio software can

3361
02:41:56,011 --> 02:42:01,011
manipulate the human voice in the same
way that you could do wIth music

3362
02:42:01,711 --> 02:42:05,850
software where you could use garage band
songs without knowing any guitars.

3363
02:42:05,880 --> 02:42:09,060
So actors who are listening time to
start a podcast,

3364
02:42:09,280 --> 02:42:11,280
ah,
it's almost over bitches,

3365
02:42:11,430 --> 02:42:14,190
but it's not because you're never going
to be able to recreate like a Daniel

3366
02:42:14,190 --> 02:42:16,890
Day.
Lewis never like someone who can go that

3367
02:42:16,920 --> 02:42:18,630
deep into something.
It's almost,

3368
02:42:19,440 --> 02:42:23,400
it's almost like until he does it,
you don't know it can be done.

3369
02:42:23,670 --> 02:42:24,690
You know,
his,

3370
02:42:24,720 --> 02:42:29,310
his intense commitment to a character is
so.

3371
02:42:29,640 --> 02:42:32,460
It's so bizarre.
And it's also part of what you love

3372
02:42:32,461 --> 02:42:34,110
about watching that guy in the movies
that,

3373
02:42:34,111 --> 02:42:36,000
you know,
that's Daniel Day lewis,

3374
02:42:36,440 --> 02:42:37,470
you know,
during that first,

3375
02:42:37,810 --> 02:42:40,200
not first blood,
what is it called in,

3376
02:42:41,100 --> 02:42:43,740
there will be blood,
there will be blood character like,

3377
02:42:43,741 --> 02:42:44,820
you know,
that's him,

3378
02:42:44,821 --> 02:42:46,080
you know,
that's Daniel Day lewis.

3379
02:42:46,260 --> 02:42:51,000
But you also completely believe he's
this fucking guy that's half of the

3380
02:42:51,001 --> 02:42:56,001
thrill.
It's not just that someone does the

3381
02:42:56,251 --> 02:42:57,520
cirque de solei,
you know,

3382
02:42:57,550 --> 02:42:59,610
like look at the guy flipped,
you know,

3383
02:42:59,611 --> 02:43:04,200
that that's a person that had a practice
that they had to get so proficient that

3384
02:43:04,201 --> 02:43:09,201
they could do something that looks
impossible and then do it line by line

3385
02:43:10,440 --> 02:43:12,110
out of order.
That's

3386
02:43:12,910 --> 02:43:16,840
speakIng about recently.
I think my conception of acting is,

3387
02:43:16,960 --> 02:43:21,880
is almost like comes from a theater
world where it's like you put on a

3388
02:43:21,881 --> 02:43:25,510
costume and then you go be a different
person for two hours or whatever.

3389
02:43:25,540 --> 02:43:27,520
Like a theater movie,
amalgam.

3390
02:43:27,740 --> 02:43:32,200
Um,
but I shot this pilot recently and you

3391
02:43:32,201 --> 02:43:35,140
know,
everything was shot out of order as

3392
02:43:35,230 --> 02:43:38,470
things are when they're shot.
And it kind of gave me this insight into

3393
02:43:38,471 --> 02:43:39,190
like,
oh,

3394
02:43:39,190 --> 02:43:44,190
part so much of the skill is just your
ability to pick it up out of order and

3395
02:43:46,961 --> 02:43:49,120
act it out,
even though you know,

3396
02:43:49,160 --> 02:43:50,920
it's just,
it's so piecemeal.

3397
02:43:51,020 --> 02:43:53,100
Yeah.
What would Daniel Day lewis did?

3398
02:43:53,101 --> 02:43:56,520
the lincoln movie.
Apparently he was in character as

3399
02:43:56,521 --> 02:43:59,400
lincoln the entire time.
Talk to people as lincoln.

3400
02:43:59,401 --> 02:44:02,700
Everything he did as lincoln,
the aide is lincoln went to bed as

3401
02:44:02,701 --> 02:44:04,800
lincoln woke up as lincoln.
That's crazy.

3402
02:44:04,860 --> 02:44:07,130
It's a little much.
I agree.

3403
02:44:07,680 --> 02:44:12,420
Nutty dude to hang around with knowing
in that way because it was christian

3404
02:44:12,421 --> 02:44:14,310
bale.
Do that kind of stuff too.

3405
02:44:14,570 --> 02:44:15,590
You hear?
Sorry.

3406
02:44:15,600 --> 02:44:18,270
I mean you saw the machinist.
Do you ever see that movie?

3407
02:44:18,380 --> 02:44:19,230
You never saw that?
No.

3408
02:44:19,231 --> 02:44:20,910
I know I should though.
It's on my list.

3409
02:44:20,940 --> 02:44:23,250
Do you know what he did?
He lost a whole bunch of weight.

3410
02:44:23,251 --> 02:44:26,340
Right?
But he got to death's door.

3411
02:44:26,730 --> 02:44:30,480
I mean literally got to death's door.
He looked like an auschwitz victim.

3412
02:44:30,570 --> 02:44:34,530
I mean it's.
I don't know how a person allows

3413
02:44:34,531 --> 02:44:37,500
themselves to do that.
That's not a good image.

3414
02:44:37,530 --> 02:44:39,450
J jamie.
That's not a real image from the movie.

3415
02:44:39,920 --> 02:44:41,850
That's.
That's like a digital recreation.

3416
02:44:41,851 --> 02:44:43,140
That's him for real.
Yeah.

3417
02:44:43,330 --> 02:44:45,390
I saw.
I seen that picture.

3418
02:44:45,610 --> 02:44:49,440
Fuck man.
I mean he got to the point where his

3419
02:44:49,441 --> 02:44:53,910
body was shriveled away.
He had no body fat and he was dying.

3420
02:44:54,090 --> 02:44:59,090
He played a guy with severe insomnia
that started to have hallucinations and

3421
02:45:00,390 --> 02:45:04,260
was losing his fucking mind.
Really crazy shit.

3422
02:45:04,920 --> 02:45:08,760
But that someone takes it to that level,
but that's like one of the badges of

3423
02:45:08,761 --> 02:45:11,940
honor when it comes to those types of
actors,

3424
02:45:11,941 --> 02:45:14,970
like robert deniro.
He used to do that member in raging

3425
02:45:14,971 --> 02:45:17,280
bull,
like he got an incredible shape.

3426
02:45:17,281 --> 02:45:18,960
We got really lean,
looked like a boxer,

3427
02:45:18,961 --> 02:45:23,190
and then for the end of the movie got
really fat and he played like jake

3428
02:45:23,191 --> 02:45:25,920
lamata all swollen and filled with
spaghetti,

3429
02:45:26,310 --> 02:45:28,680
but who was it?
Who had that?

3430
02:45:28,950 --> 02:45:31,890
That famous quip is like,
why don't you just try acting?

3431
02:45:31,920 --> 02:45:33,420
Yeah.
I forget who it was.

3432
02:45:33,720 --> 02:45:36,870
I want to say.
let's just say it.

3433
02:45:36,960 --> 02:45:38,670
Whether it's true or not.
Yeah.

3434
02:45:38,730 --> 02:45:42,900
But meanwhile would have sir laurence
olivier play jake lamotta in raging

3435
02:45:42,901 --> 02:45:44,080
bull.
What did it have sucked?

3436
02:45:44,400 --> 02:45:47,760
What was good?
I suspect it would not have been as good

3437
02:45:47,810 --> 02:45:49,460
and probably whatnot have been.
Yeah,

3438
02:45:49,470 --> 02:45:53,010
I mean you like when he played that guy
in cape fear,

3439
02:45:53,360 --> 02:45:55,170
I mean to get into kind of shape that he
got in.

3440
02:45:55,171 --> 02:46:00,171
Remember when he's doing those chin ups,
like you believed that he was his rage

3441
02:46:00,691 --> 02:46:03,900
filled ex con that was coming to get
revenge.

3442
02:46:03,901 --> 02:46:07,710
Like he.
It seems like he approached life that

3443
02:46:07,711 --> 02:46:09,150
way.
It wasn't just,

3444
02:46:09,230 --> 02:46:14,230
he was acting like he had an adopted
this mindset and had it fully ingrained

3445
02:46:14,901 --> 02:46:17,750
in,
into who he was portraying on screen.

3446
02:46:17,930 --> 02:46:19,550
It's why those movies are so good.

3447
02:46:20,150 --> 02:46:22,100
Well,
maybe that is the difference between,

3448
02:46:22,430 --> 02:46:25,070
you know,
superstar powerhouse,

3449
02:46:25,071 --> 02:46:30,071
really compelling acting and just sort
of average acting is that they really

3450
02:46:30,171 --> 02:46:32,900
are living at versus they are acting it
out in a moment.

3451
02:46:33,340 --> 02:46:34,840
I mean you have to take it to the
utmost,

3452
02:46:35,020 --> 02:46:38,830
but that's also why it's so frustrating
to watch robert deniro in the intern

3453
02:46:39,400 --> 02:46:41,320
like jesus christ.
Did you see that?

3454
02:46:41,380 --> 02:46:44,340
No.
I watched clips of it on an airplane and

3455
02:46:44,341 --> 02:46:46,360
I was like,
what the fuck am I took my headphones

3456
02:46:46,361 --> 02:46:46,931
off.
Fuck,

3457
02:46:46,931 --> 02:46:50,500
am I watching stupid ass movie?
but it's just like,

3458
02:46:50,501 --> 02:46:53,860
this is a guy that was a part of like
some of the great cinematic

3459
02:46:53,861 --> 02:46:56,230
masterpieces.
he was in the godfather.

3460
02:46:56,231 --> 02:46:58,480
Ii was raging bull.
I mean,

3461
02:46:58,481 --> 02:47:00,160
he just like you.
the list goes on.

3462
02:47:00,161 --> 02:47:02,050
Taxi driver.
I mean,

3463
02:47:02,051 --> 02:47:06,220
he was in some fucking masterpieces.
Meet the fockers.

3464
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:08,590
Wasn't he in that?
Probably.

3465
02:47:08,680 --> 02:47:11,290
Probably where it started.
probably realized like I don't even have

3466
02:47:11,291 --> 02:47:14,980
to act.
Remember these stupid words to say and

3467
02:47:14,981 --> 02:47:17,230
just get some fat money,
huh?

3468
02:47:17,910 --> 02:47:18,743
Yeah.
Maybe.

3469
02:47:19,060 --> 02:47:19,670
I don't know.

3470
02:47:19,670 --> 02:47:21,530
Yeah.
Well that's kind of like.

3471
02:47:21,531 --> 02:47:24,800
I feel like al pacino has just become a
caricature of apa.

3472
02:47:24,801 --> 02:47:27,350
Chino will.
He has a rant like clause in every

3473
02:47:27,351 --> 02:47:28,184
contract.

3474
02:47:28,360 --> 02:47:33,010
Whereas my rent,
he's got a rant and every fucking movie.

3475
02:47:33,160 --> 02:47:35,260
It all started from that devil movie we
played.

3476
02:47:35,261 --> 02:47:38,080
The devil remember,
had to go on that long ass ran as the

3477
02:47:38,081 --> 02:47:39,760
devil.
Come on.

3478
02:47:40,500 --> 02:47:43,050
DevIl would have some verbose bullshit
ass from rant,

3479
02:47:43,080 --> 02:47:44,790
right?
The devil doesn't need words.

3480
02:47:44,860 --> 02:47:46,590
Oh,
but he's good at the at word level.

3481
02:47:46,591 --> 02:47:48,150
Just eat a plate of babies in front of
you.

3482
02:47:49,250 --> 02:47:51,450
Doesn't have to say anything.
Fire.

3483
02:47:51,600 --> 02:47:53,600
Yeah,
exactly.

3484
02:47:54,900 --> 02:47:56,310
I gotta get out of here.
Alison rosen.

3485
02:47:56,400 --> 02:47:57,640
This is fun.
Let's do it again.

3486
02:47:57,641 --> 02:48:00,020
Which I would love to.
And people can get your podcasts

3487
02:48:00,030 --> 02:48:00,810
everywhere,
