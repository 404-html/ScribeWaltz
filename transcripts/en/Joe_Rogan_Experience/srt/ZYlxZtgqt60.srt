1
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,780
Let's, we're going to get to
this next and I, I respect you.

2
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:10,260
I want you guys to yell at each other
for three minutes while I go pee.

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:15,240
I gotta pee too. Okay. We'll do it in
shifts. We'll do it. I'll go first. Okay.

4
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:16,020
Anyways,

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:21,020
you are someone that I could talk
to about the flat earth conspiracy.

6
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,010
You don't believe in flat earth,

7
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,920
but you can kind of understand
where I'm coming from.

8
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,580
What if I finance a research
ship and make a documentary?

9
00:00:29,581 --> 00:00:33,240
I can't go away for three months. I will
pay one of them. Which one can you race?

10
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:37,860
We're going to need a, you guys go
into the moon or in orbit, okay.

11
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:42,670
Raised the money for a trip. Okay. You out

12
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:50,690
this the deal. Just go pee. Go Pee, man.
So I'm going to, we're going to do this.

13
00:00:50,691 --> 00:00:53,190
So Joe Rogan. Yeah, no, no.
We're going to do this gentleman.

14
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:57,440
You're going to find the edge of
the world. They ice caps, caps.

15
00:00:57,441 --> 00:01:02,360
They're knocking things off the drop
off with my iPhone. Go Pee, man.

16
00:01:02,361 --> 00:01:06,820
Hopi. Don't you have to go? We're
going to send someone else. Alex. Hey,

17
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:12,200
I got to back them up to be the
one that goes, wait a minute,

18
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:13,430
let me tell you something right now.

19
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,760
I came here and I proved they're
keeping babies alive and dangler organs.

20
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:23,190
How did you prove that Jamie pulled
some shit. They admitted that.

21
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,690
Normalizing it. No, the fuck the governor.

22
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:33,490
You really think there's people out there
campaigning for late term abortions.

23
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:37,700
You'd think that Shit's real.
You. They say six rounded Monday.

24
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:43,500
Who would campaign for it that they lost

25
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:48,630
their fucking Kelly already catch.

26
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:53,810
So you're telling me it isn't real when
they had a fucking Goddamn fucking set

27
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:55,850
it.
That's a conspiracy theory

28
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,900
that you're fucking top
of your about to get it.

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,710
They're killing it already born babies.
Stop fucking lying. God fucking damn.

30
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:08,630
I'm getting pissed out. Don't
get pissed. You saw the dude.

31
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:09,920
It's fucking

32
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,110
fucking
fucking owls.

33
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,770
Let me claim the course.

34
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:26,580
I believe that we went into
a long conversation about
we played. I heard it. Okay.

35
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,180
You heard it.
I heard the whole podcast,

36
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:34,430
but come on at you in my psychosis is
reality is so crazy that I always thought

37
00:02:34,701 --> 00:02:38,730
I was so tough. That doesn't have to pay
anymore. It'll piss a little bit out.

38
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:42,050
Point is the point is, is
that the point is, is that,

39
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,080
why are we debating whether the
earth is flat? Dude, they're keeping,

40
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:47,060
they have human animal hybrids.

41
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:51,470
Okay.
