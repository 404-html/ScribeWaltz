1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:03,630
Her low freak bitches is huge.

2
00:00:03,631 --> 00:00:06,840
Where I'll be like a thing going on now
is a lot of people are building like a

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:08,400
dorms.

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:08,790
Yeah.

5
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:09,623
Their capstone,

6
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:10,523
which makes a lot of sense.

7
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,390
So many guys are bouncing around to sure.

8
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:12,790
You know,

9
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:16,410
they come from out of town to go train
in and a great Jackson's is building one

10
00:00:16,411 --> 00:00:16,861
like that.

11
00:00:16,861 --> 00:00:17,790
And Greg,

12
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:19,560
Jack Cowboy said he
has a bad motherfucker.

13
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,640
Rans Cowboy.

14
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,020
Cowboy look against Cotto holy
fucking screaming at the TV.

15
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:29,070
He looked fucking awesome.

16
00:00:29,071 --> 00:00:30,120
Sensational.

17
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:31,170
And one 70,

18
00:00:31,171 --> 00:00:32,730
he looks goddamn sensational.

19
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,060
I mean that it's like everything
came together at one 70.

20
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,800
[inaudible] and [inaudible] is a beast,

21
00:00:37,801 --> 00:00:38,190
man.

22
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:38,610
Nope.

23
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:40,590
Nobody's ever worked Coty over the way.

24
00:00:40,591 --> 00:00:41,340
Cowboy did.

25
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,980
And he's he coattails far father
like two oh five before too,

26
00:00:43,981 --> 00:00:44,151
right?

27
00:00:44,151 --> 00:00:44,290
Yeah.

28
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:46,980
Because the first is what
he was saying that uh,

29
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:48,270
at one 70,

30
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,400
the guy who was also like
a one 55 are coming up,

31
00:00:50,401 --> 00:00:51,390
but it was like a new weight.

32
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:51,910
Right?

33
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:52,710
Hmm.

34
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:53,400
Who's this first?

35
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:53,521
Oh,

36
00:00:53,521 --> 00:00:54,354
cowboys.

37
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,513
Yeah.

38
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:56,620
Yeah.

39
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:57,540
Was a big dude.

40
00:00:57,541 --> 00:00:58,860
That was that other cowboy dude.

41
00:00:58,861 --> 00:00:59,330
Yeah.

42
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:00,060
Um,

43
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,080
but that guy is big.

44
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,070
He's a big fella.

45
00:01:02,071 --> 00:01:03,480
He was bigger than cowboy boots cowboy.

46
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:04,350
I caught him in the triangle,

47
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:05,550
but he just looked great.

48
00:01:05,551 --> 00:01:08,070
But like Kofi with a body like
one 85 and then he started,

49
00:01:08,071 --> 00:01:11,040
his first fight was at two oh
five he dropped Tito Ortiz.

50
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,180
This is way back in the day.

51
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,030
It's when Tito was a light
heavyweight champ I believe.

52
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:19,830
And I think Tito was
either champ or in the,

53
00:01:19,831 --> 00:01:20,400
I mean it was,

54
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,060
Tito was in his prime and he lost to
Tito at light heavyweight and then went

55
00:01:24,061 --> 00:01:26,070
down to one 85 fought Anderson Silva.

56
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,120
He was doing very well,

57
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:28,830
very smart fight.

58
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:32,820
He fought a very smart fight against
Anderson where he was like making Anderson

59
00:01:32,821 --> 00:01:36,360
lead in Anderson's really counter guy and
he was just sort of laying it back and

60
00:01:36,361 --> 00:01:37,710
Anderson didn't like it and he doesn't,

61
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,760
the Anderson does not like it when he
had like a weird knee popped or something

62
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:41,730
and he blew out.

63
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:42,391
Yeah,

64
00:01:42,391 --> 00:01:45,260
you're like lifted his leg up to throw
a kick and his knee just buckled and

65
00:01:45,261 --> 00:01:46,160
shaved in on him.

66
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,220
Shit happen sometimes.

67
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,030
Like,

68
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:48,480
Oh yeah,

69
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,291
weird freak shit.

70
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:50,760
Like that happens a lot in this sport.

71
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:51,331
Well sure.

72
00:01:51,331 --> 00:01:54,570
And there's also like injuries that you
get like the second and third round that

73
00:01:54,571 --> 00:01:55,850
you don't even know what you mean.

74
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:56,880
You felt your knee pop,

75
00:01:56,881 --> 00:01:59,760
you're not exactly sure what it is and
you're still standing on and everything

76
00:01:59,761 --> 00:02:02,610
seems fine and then you throw
a kick and it just gives out.

77
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,103
There's that,

78
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:04,621
you know?

79
00:02:04,621 --> 00:02:06,930
But the point is Coty is a stud.

80
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,291
He said,

81
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:10,710
tough fucking guy and to have cowboy work,

82
00:02:10,711 --> 00:02:11,281
I'm like that.

83
00:02:11,281 --> 00:02:11,610
I was like,

84
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:12,630
whew,

85
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:14,230
Ninja.

86
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:16,530
It looked fucking Aussie
like terminator that night.

87
00:02:16,531 --> 00:02:17,220
Like he looks like,

88
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:17,551
yeah,

89
00:02:17,551 --> 00:02:17,910
awesome.

90
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,700
It looked like a world
fucking happy for me.

91
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,420
Legit world champion.

92
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,230
Yup.

93
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:22,441
Yeah.

94
00:02:22,441 --> 00:02:23,670
I hope he can keep that together.

95
00:02:23,671 --> 00:02:24,390
I really do.

96
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:29,390
I think one 70 I think these guys that
are fucking depleting themselves so badly

97
00:02:29,461 --> 00:02:30,294
to cut weight,

98
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,040
I think that's going to
be a thing of the past.

99
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:32,521
I really do.

100
00:02:32,521 --> 00:02:33,720
I think people got to realize like,

101
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,630
this is not the benefit that you get
in that is it's negligible cowboys.

102
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:38,970
Wayne,

103
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:43,170
like one 76 somewhere around that and
he's cutting just a little bit of weight

104
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,600
and making one 70 easy.

105
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:46,300
Yeah.

106
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,810
I think he was like four or five
pounds off when he came there.

107
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,673
Zero.

108
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,730
We sparked a couple of weeks before the
fight and he was like 14 days out and he

109
00:02:53,731 --> 00:02:54,690
was like five pounds.

110
00:02:54,691 --> 00:02:56,220
Like you'd go out to eat,

111
00:02:56,221 --> 00:02:56,920
we're eating whatever.

112
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,390
Well,

113
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:58,540
that's nice shit.

114
00:02:59,070 --> 00:02:59,970
Drinking a beer.

115
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,840
He's so fucking ridiculous with that.

116
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,360
He drinks beer up until
the day of the weigh ins.

117
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:05,323
Yeah,

118
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,700
that can't be good right now.

119
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:09,820
Why?

120
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:10,001
Well,

121
00:03:10,001 --> 00:03:11,410
a little bit of beer is probably okay.

122
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:21,690
Okay.
