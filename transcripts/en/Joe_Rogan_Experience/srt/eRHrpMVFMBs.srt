1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,520
The Joe Rogan experience,
it's a matter of time,

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:03,473
right?
Hopefully.

3
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:05,100
Yeah.
Well my dad is hilarious.

4
00:00:05,101 --> 00:00:10,101
My Dad is 86 and three quarters and he
sent me an email today and it said,

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,460
here's a link to an article about a
marijuana reform,

6
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,181
and he said,
oh,

7
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:19,050
it's going to be legal in my lifetime.
I was like,

8
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:19,981
Dad.
I said,

9
00:00:19,981 --> 00:00:21,180
I hope you're right.
You know,

10
00:00:21,181 --> 00:00:22,970
even if you have to live another 20
years.

11
00:00:22,971 --> 00:00:25,890
So I would have never thought in 2013.
It was still be illegal.

12
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,740
When I was a kid I,
I thought it was a matter of time.

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,260
Well I was on the board of normal for
awhile,

14
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:36,530
quite awhile and I was with people who
started normal in 1970 and 71 and

15
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:38,160
thought it would be legal in a few
years.

16
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:43,110
So that sort of tempers my,
a sense of time to be with people who,

17
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,380
you know,
over 40 years ago thought it was only

18
00:00:46,381 --> 00:00:48,720
going to be a few years away that
marijuana will be legal.

19
00:00:48,721 --> 00:00:52,110
Unfortunately they're still working to
try to help bring that about.

20
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,130
Do you lose enthusiasm sometimes when
you see that it's still illegal after

21
00:00:56,131 --> 00:00:57,660
all this,
now it's the,

22
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,310
um,
it's about,

23
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,470
it's a worthy,
like on a worthy opponent.

24
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,670
It's a worthy goal and so I think we
just do what we want to do.

25
00:01:05,671 --> 00:01:10,671
There's times when I felt like I was so
blocked that I needed to do something

26
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,780
where I could actually see change and so
I stopped work for a week and painted my

27
00:01:15,781 --> 00:01:16,614
house.

28
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:22,180
Great.
That's really must,

29
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:24,660
must,
must get to feel like you're spinning

30
00:01:24,661 --> 00:01:26,080
your wheels sometimes.
Well,

31
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:30,700
for years,
and we just spent four years with Health

32
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:35,310
Canada trying to get an import export
permit to bring in eight grams of Mgma

33
00:01:35,311 --> 00:01:40,311
and this is after Health Canada had
approved the protocol and our irb had

34
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:45,440
approved the protocol and the four years
it took and they went through all these

35
00:01:46,051 --> 00:01:49,470
ridiculous things about the pharmacy had
to have bulletproof glass.

36
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:53,700
It had to have all these alarm systems.
Class people are gonna come in and steal

37
00:01:53,701 --> 00:01:57,120
your eight grams of acid.
That was eight grams.

38
00:01:57,121 --> 00:01:59,400
Yeah.
That would be in a safe and the safe had

39
00:01:59,401 --> 00:02:03,960
to be disguised in a wooden cabinet and
the had to be bolted to the floor.

40
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,770
They were harder than the U.
S it was ridiculous,

41
00:02:06,771 --> 00:02:10,080
but.
But we eventually prevailed.

42
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,420
We just took every ridiculous thing and
we did it.

43
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,750
I mean,
my policy is surrender when there's

44
00:02:15,751 --> 00:02:19,050
certain kinds of irrational things
coming from people who are more

45
00:02:19,051 --> 00:02:20,310
powerful,
try to give it to them.

46
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,080
Well,
that's probably why you're in the

47
00:02:22,081 --> 00:02:25,500
position that you're in your facilitator
of this.

48
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:28,440
I'm willing to dialogue venture forth.
Yeah.

49
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:29,470
Yeah.

50
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,000
Wow.
And then there's the legislation that is

51
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:34,460
being passed right now in several states
to start to try to stop,

52
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,190
to prohibit with these guys are doing my
filming under cover,

53
00:02:37,191 --> 00:02:37,671
so it's.
Yeah,

54
00:02:37,671 --> 00:02:39,020
I've seen that.
How has,

55
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,340
how,
how's that flying?

56
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,460
How are they allowing people to do that?
Because everyone is outraged when they

57
00:02:43,461 --> 00:02:45,050
see those videos.
Even the media,

58
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:49,220
they watched those videos of people.
Like I saw one of this abuse that was

59
00:02:49,221 --> 00:02:52,960
going on with these cows were the sky
was like hitting a cow with a crowbar

60
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:54,620
and it's there.
So horrific.

61
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,170
And again,
another thing is being exposed by

62
00:02:57,171 --> 00:03:00,070
technology.
I believe that that video could

63
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:02,140
have very well come from the guy that we
feature.

64
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,170
Um,
he's sort of the main one of the biggest

65
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:10,800
undercover animal rights activist and
blur out his face or his voice.

66
00:03:11,231 --> 00:03:14,680
But we definitely heard his.
Actually he has,

67
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,750
he's had,
I don't know how many name changes

68
00:03:16,751 --> 00:03:21,160
throughout his life and this,
he's been doing it for 10 years and he's

69
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,730
sort of a few ever want to do any
undercover filming.

70
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:24,850
This is the guy who needs to talk to
him.

71
00:03:24,851 --> 00:03:27,850
And he actually gave me some training
because a lot of all of this show is

72
00:03:27,851 --> 00:03:31,240
about undercover filming.
He gave me some training into filming

73
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,560
undercover.
He sent me out into the parking lot and

74
00:03:33,561 --> 00:03:36,820
told me that first I had to go to that
woman over there.

75
00:03:36,821 --> 00:03:38,650
She's a perfect stranger and you have to
ask her.

76
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:39,910
You have to get information from her.

77
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:43,060
I want to know where she lived before
she lived here and I had to go and do

78
00:03:43,061 --> 00:03:46,750
that and I passed that really easily,
but then the second test that he made me

79
00:03:46,751 --> 00:03:51,751
do was I had to go out there and make a
woman sort of run away from me because

80
00:03:51,851 --> 00:03:53,740
she was scared and I'm not very good at
that.

81
00:03:53,741 --> 00:03:55,600
I'm good at getting information from
people,

82
00:03:55,601 --> 00:03:59,410
but I can't.
It's not in my nature to be mean or

83
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,760
scary or intimidating.
And so I went to a parking lot and I

84
00:04:03,761 --> 00:04:06,850
just started acting wild,
crazy and not really scary.

85
00:04:06,851 --> 00:04:08,650
Just crazy.
Like where is water?

86
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:13,210
Where can I find some water?
People were just staring at me with this

87
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:15,550
crazy woman probably thinking that was
on bath salts.

88
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,360
Are they trying to get you to do all
this?

89
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:23,440
So this is part of the training is that
you have to be able to make people feel

90
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:26,740
either very comfortable with you so they
give you information that you need,

91
00:04:26,741 --> 00:04:30,430
that you want to get for your,
for your undercover filming or very

92
00:04:30,431 --> 00:04:34,000
uncomfortable with you so that you feel
the need to either leave.

93
00:04:34,001 --> 00:04:36,430
So you can fill more or intimidating to
a point,

94
00:04:36,431 --> 00:04:39,340
intimidated to the point that you will
release any information you give without

95
00:04:39,341 --> 00:04:41,140
actually resorting to violence
obviously.

96
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:43,870
So it was really,
it was really an interesting little

97
00:04:43,871 --> 00:04:44,980
practice that we had with them.

98
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:49,500
It's an amazing how much people identify
with their genitals because there's a

99
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:53,460
thing that women hate more than not want
more than anything was left.

100
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:56,080
I mean that's a massive generalization
that has taught myself.

101
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:59,860
But there's one thing that a lot of
women really do not appreciate.

102
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,800
And that's stinky pussy jokes.
You know,

103
00:05:03,801 --> 00:05:07,000
you could talk about your stinky feet,
who can talk about a girl.

104
00:05:07,001 --> 00:05:09,490
Stinky feet,
can talk about a girl's breath.

105
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:13,330
You can talk about our girls,
but you can't talk about a girl stinky

106
00:05:13,331 --> 00:05:16,930
pussy to them.
You can lose a lot of people that don't

107
00:05:16,931 --> 00:05:18,820
like when you talk about it.
Even onstage,

108
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,481
really like,
yes,

109
00:05:19,481 --> 00:05:20,110
yes,
yes.

110
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:22,960
I've seen someone do a stinky pussy joke
and I've seen women in the audience

111
00:05:22,961 --> 00:05:23,860
going,
oh,

112
00:05:23,861 --> 00:05:28,840
come on.
Just upset that you put that possibility

113
00:05:28,841 --> 00:05:32,560
out there.
I've never smelled a bed fucking pussy

114
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:35,180
like
coke.

115
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,950
No,
I'm a fucking gets that.

116
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,010
If I pick up a chick at a bar,
she's drugged.

117
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:41,900
I'm thinking,
I'm like that thick.

118
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:46,070
Take a shower.
I just won't help us.

119
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,970
But I got my finger banged that girl and
I'm in Idaho falls.

120
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,020
And then being an American Indian I
finger,

121
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:58,880
she had those daisy dukes was triple
night is and I'm all warmed up.

122
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:01,590
I got like $32.
I got no blow.

123
00:06:01,591 --> 00:06:06,170
I'm drinking budweiser fucking furious
and I'm dancing on it and she's letting

124
00:06:06,171 --> 00:06:09,470
me touch her Joe Rogan and I stick my
hand in like this way,

125
00:06:09,471 --> 00:06:12,560
like full finger,
lose my fucking Twat.

126
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:17,890
And I had that fucking yoga look at size
and I was bringing her this way,

127
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,670
you know a Bruce Lee,
you know,

128
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:24,671
I was
like Mikey and I took it out.

129
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:26,810
I could.
I was dancing with it.

130
00:06:26,811 --> 00:06:31,811
I could smell my hand and that was it.
I've met by just go do something

131
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:36,140
and you can't get it off.
Do you know that the smell of fish is

132
00:06:36,141 --> 00:06:40,790
actually from old come usually.
So if it's a really strong fish smelled,

133
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:44,030
that means there's common side of her.
That's funny because that's what my

134
00:06:44,031 --> 00:06:46,580
ball's always smelled like if I jerk off
and don't wipe up.

135
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,260
Smells like fish.

136
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:54,960
So realizing I used to take ladies about
my own jazz.

137
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:57,590
I shoot,
she did my pubes and pull my underwear.

138
00:06:57,591 --> 00:06:59,480
I buy away.
I've done that dozens of times in my

139
00:06:59,481 --> 00:07:03,230
life to shoot of.
I jerk off,

140
00:07:03,231 --> 00:07:05,990
I just shoot a load on my pubes.
I don't even bother cleaning now,

141
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,730
but I just pull my underwear up.
I do that.

142
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:08,840
I'm in the house.
I'm like,

143
00:07:08,841 --> 00:07:10,340
as long as it's covered,
whatever we give a fuck.

144
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:15,400
If I'm in the whole town by myself,
I'll get who cares on the bed and laid

145
00:07:15,821 --> 00:07:18,200
on it.
I don't give a fuck fuck fucking all

146
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:18,500
day.
It's.

147
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,560
I thought about it.
This is my little tropical helmet juice.

148
