1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,200
[inaudible] to server.
Ah, recording discernment.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:08,400
The Joe Rogan experience. I almost said
it again. I will say the Joe rogan.net.

3
00:00:08,401 --> 00:00:11,070
Is that because I'm a fucking
idiot bro. Why? Asking questions.

4
00:00:11,071 --> 00:00:11,904
He known me for years.

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,010
The Joe Rogan experience podcast is
brought to you by the fleshlight.

6
00:00:17,011 --> 00:00:21,180
If you go to Joe rogan.net and click on
the link for the flashlight and enter in

7
00:00:21,181 --> 00:00:22,170
the code name Rogan,

8
00:00:22,171 --> 00:00:26,730
you will save 15% on the
number one sex toy for men.

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,120
And it does feel good. Doug Benson,
you've never fucked one of those.

10
00:00:30,121 --> 00:00:34,080
I still haven't done that. I got one
for Ya. It's on my bucket list. Well,

11
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,680
I'm giving you a new one tonight.
Here we go. Bitches buckle up.

12
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,400
Doug Vance is in the house.
Doctor Joe,

13
00:00:41,401 --> 00:00:43,290
you're on fucking deep in trouble.

14
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,193
Cool.

15
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:06,320
So, so fitting that my good friend
Doug Benson is here with me today.

16
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:11,480
Most rock and music of any
podcasts probably. Is it the
most rocking? Yeah. Every,

17
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,990
everyone else's songs are like cute or
they're just sort of like a, you know,

18
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:18,380
they sound like alternative comedy
would sound if it were music,

19
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:20,950
alternative comedy with
side of it was music.

20
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,480
Something to nod your head off and
the drive off the road into a tree.

21
00:01:24,481 --> 00:01:26,510
Something kind of folky,
maybe poppy,

22
00:01:26,511 --> 00:01:30,620
but that that really wakes you up here
is really rocks and it was too loud in my

23
00:01:30,621 --> 00:01:33,020
headphones that that
boom, boom, boom. Yeah,

24
00:01:33,021 --> 00:01:35,480
that's just to let you know you're
not supposed to be comfortable always.

25
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:38,510
Sometimes the, the, the
beauty that comes afterwards,

26
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,270
you would appreciate it more
because he went through those drums.

27
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:43,580
That's what I'm saying, right?
Yeah. You're startled and then,

28
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:46,430
and then it's soothing and then it's like
okay, he's not going to do that again.

29
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:50,450
And that's Joey Diaz is here and then
poor Brian and scrambling every five

30
00:01:50,451 --> 00:01:52,420
seconds reaching for the volume dial.
Wait,

31
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:56,210
we have to eventually get compression
like a, the great Adam Carolla his,

32
00:01:56,211 --> 00:01:59,810
his setup is so, so bad ass.
I had total podcasts envy.

33
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:02,570
I went over to his set up
and he's got like real staff.

34
00:02:02,571 --> 00:02:04,790
He's got a crew of people working there.
There was like five,

35
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:05,930
six people working in this,

36
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:10,280
all this electronics and equipment and
video switches and, and I'm like, wow,

37
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:13,730
you sit on a couch. Yeah. Did Jesus
better though? We did the couch.

38
00:02:13,731 --> 00:02:16,370
This is way better for,
for the folks in iTunes.

39
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:20,660
We used to do what we used to have this
stupid fucking z Gallerie couch that I

40
00:02:20,661 --> 00:02:23,850
bought and I just figured, well, let's
just say, make a comment about that.

41
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,740
But the problem is the couches are only
good if someone's staring opposite.

42
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,371
You have,

43
00:02:28,371 --> 00:02:31,250
you're sitting back and relaxing and
someone's on the other side of the room,

44
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:34,470
but an office chair is way better.
It's pretty much more supportive. Yeah.

45
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,850
So we go back, we have a circular
table now in an office chair.

46
00:02:37,851 --> 00:02:40,400
This is as much as we,
we started out with just a laptop.

47
00:02:40,401 --> 00:02:41,550
So this is a big incidents.
This,

48
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:44,690
it's like we came to the table to do some
business. He had a fucking, we're not,

49
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:49,520
we're not here to just sit back and fuck
around. We are here to do some business.

50
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:53,720
Dr Drew. Oh my God, dude, you're
shocked. You're so bad at doctor drew.

51
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:57,950
It's upsetting to me because I know that
he knows what he's saying is not true.

52
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:58,903
I know that he,

53
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,820
what he's saying is
sensationalist nonsense that
he's saying because he hopes it

54
00:03:03,821 --> 00:03:07,760
will either get people like me to
pay attention and no, he's not.

55
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,630
I know he's sincere about it.
I think he's doing it to get ratings.

56
00:03:10,631 --> 00:03:13,240
He's doing it to be a certain guy.
It's not what he's saying.

57
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,450
This is what he's saying,
Brian,

58
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:18,370
to this fucking thing up because somebody
tweeted me this today and I just sat

59
00:03:18,371 --> 00:03:20,830
there with my mouth open,
shaking my head going, this is a,

60
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:24,310
this is a nonsense argument, man. This
is a stupid argument. Listen to this.

61
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:27,310
This is about a bust in Florida.
Real 21

62
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:30,060
get out, but I've jumped in
pretty say to you, how dare you?

63
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:34,680
How dare you think he's my friend?
You'd be good to him. Okay.

64
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:37,830
We're keeping drug counselor Shelley's
Sprague with us for this next story.

65
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:42,630
28 Palm Beach County high school students
were caught by surprise when they were

66
00:03:42,631 --> 00:03:44,670
arrested.
In a drug sting in Florida.

67
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:49,380
The nine month investigation was called
Operation d minus undercover officers

68
00:03:49,381 --> 00:03:53,340
posed as students, befriended the kids
and allegedly brought pop from them.

69
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,010
The suspects in the case of
course it need not be set,

70
00:03:56,011 --> 00:03:57,990
are innocent until proven guilty,
but watch this.

71
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:02,620
Marijuana is a
drug.

72
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:05,440
The THC content and marijuana
these days would be improved.

73
00:04:05,441 --> 00:04:08,360
Growing methods is much stronger than

74
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,460
many years ago.
Down to that,

75
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:14,810
I want to live long enough to see you
at the time when it's not necessary.

76
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:20,950
We're going to keep doing it as long as we
drove down this room.

77
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,140
I actually agree with these guys though.
I'm always cast as the NARC.

78
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:28,930
I'm not a NARC. I'm not interested in
telling you about how to live their life,

79
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,780
but I'm interested in the health of
young people and this kind of thing is a

80
00:04:31,781 --> 00:04:33,100
good idea. Don't you think, Shelly? Hey,

81
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:38,110
do I think that keeping drugs out of
schools at these formative ages are

82
00:04:38,771 --> 00:04:43,771
important and pushing the age of
exposure to college age and above,

83
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:46,150
I think is important.

84
00:04:46,151 --> 00:04:48,580
I think that there's a lot of
misinformation about pot out there.

85
00:04:48,581 --> 00:04:51,970
There's this weird cultural ener energy
around the drug and people are unwilling

86
00:04:51,971 --> 00:04:53,410
to accept the fact that it's addictive.

87
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:56,830
It's a different pot than it was 20
years ago. It's absolutely different.

88
00:04:56,831 --> 00:05:00,540
There's withdrawal syndromes,
the involved with it. Um, and,

89
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:03,220
and I just think people
have so much misinformation.

90
00:05:03,221 --> 00:05:08,080
I consistently hear people undereducated
about what's going on in the drug

91
00:05:08,081 --> 00:05:12,250
cultures of today and, and the, you
know, keeping up with the bath salts,

92
00:05:12,251 --> 00:05:14,860
keeping up with marijuana,
keeping up with all of these changes,

93
00:05:14,861 --> 00:05:19,000
legislation changes. I mean, it's
a full time job, surely. Thank you.

94
00:05:19,001 --> 00:05:20,440
It's always good to see here.
Appreciate it.

95
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:23,530
And I want to just emphasize
the fact that cannabis,

96
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,350
according to the American
Society of addiction medicine,
not just me and Shelly,

97
00:05:26,351 --> 00:05:28,030
and I see this all the time,
is addictive.

98
00:05:28,031 --> 00:05:30,370
It's one of the more common
things we treat the these days.

99
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:33,190
It has a rather severe withdrawal
center associated with it.

100
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:36,070
And the addictive process is
always the same with cannabis.

101
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:39,850
It's somebody who uses just a couple
times and then has this, oh my God,

102
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:41,440
experiences is the greatest thing ever.

103
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:45,880
And then preoccupies and uses every
day thereafter, somewhere out there,

104
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:49,930
months or years later, it stops working
so well. They start getting irritable,

105
00:05:49,931 --> 00:05:51,310
paranoid,
not so high anymore.

106
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,850
They use a lot more to try to bring the
high back and that's when they get into

107
00:05:54,851 --> 00:05:59,180
very serious trouble with the dog and
switch to else like what worries me is

108
00:05:59,181 --> 00:06:01,490
bath salts.
Tonight was a really interesting night.

109
00:06:01,491 --> 00:06:04,940
Please take note about the bath salts.
They are out there.

110
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:09,350
If you or someone you love was getting
exposed to substances get help.

111
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:13,250
The sad thing about Corey story is
that he had, this is a treatable thing,

112
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,970
completely treatable and he needed
to be walking around in dangerous,

113
00:06:16,971 --> 00:06:20,740
the dangerous condition he is in. Now,
I also want to say that our whole,

114
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,990
our hopes and wishes are out there
for Maria Shriver. Kill that.

115
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:29,520
What his hopes and wishes are
over Maria Shriver, you whore,

116
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:33,600
you whore. They get through
these terrible times. You whore.

117
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:38,160
Your heritage hasn't been a living
hell for the last 20 years. That has a,

118
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:41,190
that's horror. Like doctor drew,
I love you, but you're a whore.

119
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,710
I just have to call you out, dude.
This is nonsense talk you say so he,

120
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,251
first of all,

121
00:06:47,251 --> 00:06:50,850
what he's saying is that marijuana is a
lot of information there and marijuana

122
00:06:50,851 --> 00:06:54,570
is higher today than ever. Both
for, well, yes it is. It's better.

123
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:58,320
Here's the real statistics.
Okay. You Ready? A long time ago,

124
00:06:58,321 --> 00:07:03,321
back in the 1970s the THC content of the
average marijuana was less than 1% it

125
00:07:04,621 --> 00:07:08,280
was weak ass, shitty weed, the
average weed. But since Amelia,

126
00:07:08,281 --> 00:07:10,020
if you get some high potent shit,

127
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:14,910
it's as high as 30% 14 to
30% and was back then too.

128
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:18,660
You could find some bad motherfuckers
back then they got some shit and they

129
00:07:18,661 --> 00:07:21,630
brought it up from South America and
it'll blow your fucking socks off.

130
00:07:21,631 --> 00:07:22,830
That's a fact.
Yeah.

131
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:27,890
The WAC weed back then is weaker than
the Wac we'd today the whack we today is

132
00:07:28,711 --> 00:07:30,510
about 5% okay.

133
00:07:30,511 --> 00:07:35,511
But the really strong stuff gets 30
32 34 if you've got some crazy shit.

134
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:39,120
So it's slightly higher for
the highest grade stuff.

135
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,390
And the reason why is because there's
a lot of scientists and botanists.

136
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:45,330
Heres the point.
There's no bodies.

137
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:49,020
No one's dying from this
extra potent weed. You know
what? This extra potent weed,

138
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:50,340
it's getting you higher,
easier.

139
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:53,160
You don't have to take two hits instead
of six back then they would smoke a

140
00:07:53,161 --> 00:07:56,310
whole joint because the joint was made
at a dog. Shit, it was terrible weed.

141
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:59,280
So this is stupid, stupid
argument. Second of all,

142
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:04,230
him saying that it's physically addictive
and that there's withdrawal symptoms.

143
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:07,500
Look, there's withdrawal
symptoms from gambling, okay?

144
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:11,320
And there's withdrawal symptoms from video
games and there's withdrawal symptoms.

145
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:15,560
Cough, coffee, coffees, way worse. That's
a physical withdrawal. You, you'll shit,

146
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:18,030
you're shaking if you don't get your
coffee, if you don't get your weed,

147
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:19,230
you're like, oh, bummer.

148
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:24,290
And Him citing whatever fucking government
organization that measures addictive

149
00:08:25,141 --> 00:08:29,190
drugs. Guess what, man? That's
all. All that stuff is nonsense.

150
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,900
There's no real studies being done on how
much marijuana withdrawals affects the

151
00:08:33,901 --> 00:08:37,440
average person and they're not putting
people through marijuana and measuring

152
00:08:37,441 --> 00:08:41,340
them. Here's the people that have
problems with pot ready, losers.

153
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:44,130
The people that problem with pot, and
this was in one of my jokes is one of my,

154
00:08:44,131 --> 00:08:47,130
one of my cds. But it's true.
If Pot fucked up your life,

155
00:08:47,131 --> 00:08:50,790
it's just cause pot got there first.
Okay. It could've been cheeseburgers,

156
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:53,130
scratch tickets,
the horse races.

157
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,980
If folks have a plant
that makes you look at

158
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:00,360
the world in a more humble way, it makes
food taste better. It makes you silly.

159
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:03,570
It makes you want to love your
friends more, make sex better,

160
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:06,780
makes food taste better.
If that fucks up your life,

161
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,990
you are an idiot and it's that simple.

162
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:15,110
And doctor Jews not doing anybody any
favors and giving idiots a little bandaid

163
00:09:15,301 --> 00:09:19,290
for their fucking mental problems because
that's what this is three of our last

164
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:23,340
three presidents who all admitted to
having smoked marijuana. He would,

165
00:09:23,341 --> 00:09:26,370
they're suggesting that they should
have been arrested in high school for

166
00:09:26,371 --> 00:09:27,900
getting involved with it.
It's really,

167
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
it makes no sense is so he's right in a
way that I don't like the idea of drugs

168
00:09:33,901 --> 00:09:35,670
in high school because kids
don't know what the fuck.

169
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:39,480
They're not making an educated choice
and they're not making it about Ponte.

170
00:09:39,481 --> 00:09:40,620
They're not making it about coke.

171
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:42,960
They're not making it about all
kinds of shit that comes our way.

172
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:45,930
And a lot of fucking sometimes in
high school is tough enough, man.

173
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:48,720
I don't advocate you doing anything you
don't feel like you're comfortable with.

174
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:51,420
I did a lot of shit in high school.
I smoked weed and high school.

175
00:09:51,421 --> 00:09:53,700
I got drunk and high school.
The drunk. Has he ever gotten,

176
00:09:53,701 --> 00:09:56,220
nobody ever taught me how to drink. Nobody
ever taught me how much she can drink.

177
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:59,070
So I got super drunk with my friends,
threw up in a cab and I get,

178
00:09:59,071 --> 00:10:02,320
why aren't we sending people undercover
to stop kids from drinking in schools?

179
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,270
Yeah,
no shit man.

180
00:10:03,271 --> 00:10:08,250
Because it's that not more than 28 why
do we leap frog to a weed which causes a

181
00:10:08,251 --> 00:10:11,190
lot less problems with the kid
in their overall lives? Right.

182
00:10:11,191 --> 00:10:16,191
And who are these hormone lists bitches
posing as cops that can actually pretend

183
00:10:16,771 --> 00:10:21,600
to be 17 and an infiltrate this
school. Oh, what the fuck. Meanwhile,

184
00:10:21,601 --> 00:10:24,150
if the kids they're infiltrating
were probably too high to notice.

185
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:29,250
There were 40 beards and shit
and the canes people to fucking,

186
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:34,290
yeah, liver spots. Why does
Linda have a walker? She's full.

187
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:37,600
She's only 16 and what are the
symptoms that they're talking about?

188
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,810
They send the addiction study,
whatever that was.

189
00:10:39,811 --> 00:10:44,520
What are the addictions that movies suck?
Listen, man, it's real simple. Physically.

190
00:10:44,521 --> 00:10:48,450
It's not the drug that addicts to you.
It doesn't clean to your body.

191
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,670
You can get mentally addicted to it,

192
00:10:50,671 --> 00:10:54,090
but you can get mentally ill addicted
to every single thing on this earth.

193
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,060
There's people that are addicted
literally to washing their hands.

194
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,340
You can call it obsessive
compulsive disorder.

195
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:02,190
I call it being addicted to his
particular set of activities.

196
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,880
And that's what it is, man.
People are fucking weird.
Comforts you. Yes, for what?

197
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:09,210
You know, whatever weird thing
it is you do over and over again.

198
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:12,840
It's because it's something you enjoy
doing. You know, we're human beings.

199
00:11:12,841 --> 00:11:15,420
We don't repeat things over and
over again because we hate it.

200
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:17,370
Sometimes we do that.
Well,

201
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:20,560
you know an accident pick scabs
and your movie you didn't.

202
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,980
That's the worst smoke weed
for 30 days and you're moving.

203
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:26,700
Do you have any withdrawal symptoms
when you're in it? Well, you know,

204
00:11:26,701 --> 00:11:30,050
people would argue watching the
movie that I got cranky but,

205
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:35,430
but you know, I think I was just
basically myself cause I certainly,

206
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:39,300
if something irritates me when I'm
high, it's still irritating. You know,

207
00:11:39,301 --> 00:11:42,870
it's not like you're just suddenly
this, hey, everything's fine.

208
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,590
Poke me with a stick. I don't give a
shit. I'm high. It's not, you're like,

209
00:11:46,591 --> 00:11:50,190
you're just, you know, your head's
in another place but you're not,

210
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:54,190
you're not gone. You know, like
the whole thing with alcohol,

211
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:59,080
the way that, uh, you know,
people say racist stuff after
they get drunk, you know,

212
00:11:59,081 --> 00:12:01,740
like it's not a lot of people were
getting high and then just, you know,

213
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:05,290
suddenly dropping the n word in
a, in a smoking circle, you know,

214
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,960
it's a totally different vibe.

215
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:10,500
It's,
if anything,

216
00:12:10,501 --> 00:12:12,870
cigarettes are the thing they
should be spending the most time on.

217
00:12:12,871 --> 00:12:17,700
Because I fucking started smoking when
I was 15 and it was easy to get fucking

218
00:12:17,701 --> 00:12:18,150
cigarettes.

219
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:22,080
I didn't fucking buy cigarettes from
some guy in the back of a fucking alley.

220
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:26,070
I went to a store and not like nine
out of 10 times I could buy cigarettes.

221
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:27,200
Yeah,
I don't,

222
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:31,310
I don't fault him for
talking about a lot of drugs.

223
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:34,160
There's a lot of drugs that are dangerous
as fuck and we should talk about

224
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:38,090
crystal meth all day long.
You should tell people don't do it.

225
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:42,260
You're going to ruin everything. It will
ruin your life. We need to tell, you know.

226
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:42,801
Yeah.
Yeah.

227
00:12:42,801 --> 00:12:47,610
I've never heard doctor drew lumpin
we'd with everything else like bad,

228
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:50,350
like yeah,
we'd and bath salts like there,

229
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:53,360
like there's any connection between the,
the two things

230
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:58,550
like legal and but crazy. Terrible
for you. Yeah. If you don't know it.

231
00:12:58,551 --> 00:13:01,430
Bath salts are, there's a thing
and we talked about on the podcast,

232
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:04,100
we were incorrect.
We had to go back and correct ourselves.

233
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:07,220
We thought that what they were doing was
selling stuff as bath salts or you can

234
00:13:07,221 --> 00:13:08,054
get high with,

235
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:11,930
what they're doing is it's a drug and
they're just labeling it bath salts to

236
00:13:11,931 --> 00:13:13,340
allow people to buy it legally.

237
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:15,650
But they have no intention
of using it for bath salts.

238
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:18,860
It's like some sort of secret little
loophole they figured out how to do and

239
00:13:18,861 --> 00:13:21,590
this drug,
it's like a cousin to crystal Meth,

240
00:13:21,591 --> 00:13:24,290
so technically it's not
illegal and there's,

241
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:28,130
there's laws that they've established
to try to get like close neighbors and

242
00:13:28,131 --> 00:13:32,570
cousins of drugs out and that's
how they got rid of five Meo DMT,

243
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,390
which was legal for the longest time.
Five meo DMT,

244
00:13:35,391 --> 00:13:38,480
which is stronger than regular
DMT somehow or another slip by.

245
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,590
They're all encompassing psychedelic,

246
00:13:40,591 --> 00:13:44,300
the act of 1970 and that you could buy
it online through a chemical company and

247
00:13:44,301 --> 00:13:47,090
get a big jar of it and shit.
We should just start calling.

248
00:13:47,091 --> 00:13:48,560
We had candy or something.

249
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,910
We should just give it a name of
something that's legal. Herbal Salad.

250
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,980
Speaking of verbal salad, Brian's dog ate
his weed or let's call it lean cuisine.

251
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:01,490
That's, that's apparently that's
legal to push that shit on people.

252
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:04,580
How does that work?
Yeah, there's the, yeah,

253
00:14:04,581 --> 00:14:08,270
go after these diet pills.
Easy and smooth.

254
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:12,200
Lose the weight with no work at
all. This is a lie. You're lying,

255
00:14:12,201 --> 00:14:14,510
you're stealing people's money.
There's nothing like that.

256
00:14:14,511 --> 00:14:16,910
Buying a shitload of weed and
then having your dog eat it.

257
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:20,240
So we need to get to get into any
of it. Your dog is a mess, man.

258
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:22,580
Your dog is a slide.
Your dog needs to go on.

259
00:14:22,581 --> 00:14:27,050
Dr Drew's show for dogs for
everything, for everything. For Sex,

260
00:14:27,051 --> 00:14:31,310
for weed. This doctor drew thing though,
does, is it not? Is it driving you crazy?

261
00:14:31,311 --> 00:14:34,500
It's driving me crazy. Well, it's a kind
of weird because I've heard Dr drew in,

262
00:14:34,501 --> 00:14:38,390
in his recently as a year
or so, say things like, uh,

263
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:42,300
he told Adam once in one of their
podcasts together that he thinks that

264
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:45,920
marijuana will be legalized in our
lifetimes. He thinks it's inevitable.

265
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,720
So I don't know why he would think that
and then also be talking this way about

266
00:14:50,721 --> 00:14:52,000
it.
And uh,

267
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:55,850
I've also heard him say that
it's a alcohol is addictive
to someone who already

268
00:14:55,851 --> 00:14:59,180
is an addict. Like they're already,
they're going to be addicted to something.

269
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:02,690
And so, I mean, marijuana, you
said alcohol. I said, yeah,

270
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:05,180
I'm saying alcoholics are,

271
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,960
can get addicted to weed was kind of
the point he was making. Oh, I see.

272
00:15:08,961 --> 00:15:13,340
What you said is that a, you kind
of have to be in an addict to, uh,

273
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:17,000
to treat we'd that way. And it
could be something, it could,

274
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:19,460
might as well be something else.
So by saying it's addictive,

275
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:24,250
it's just addictive to, there's some
people that have a certain predilection,

276
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:28,430
what's the word? Yeah,
whatever. They, they're,

277
00:15:28,431 --> 00:15:32,510
they're predisposed to addiction. So it
would be alcohol. It could be anything.

278
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:36,080
Yeah. Yeah. They're an alcoholic who
smokes too much weed or whatever.

279
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:38,240
We do have a friend that, that is, uh, he,

280
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:41,360
he used to do coke and all kinds of
other crazy stuff and now he's like super

281
00:15:41,361 --> 00:15:44,960
clean and healthy. And he told me
he can't smoke joints. He can't.

282
00:15:44,961 --> 00:15:47,990
He literally can't. He said I would
love to get high, but if I get high,

283
00:15:47,991 --> 00:15:51,140
I know it's just going to be coke and
then it's going to be whatever the fuck

284
00:15:51,141 --> 00:15:53,810
else I can get. And before
you know it, um, you know,

285
00:15:53,811 --> 00:15:56,200
I'm waking up at someone's house. I
don't know how it got there. Right.

286
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,900
And you can say the same thing about
alcohol or anything else. They like,

287
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:00,710
you have to know your limits and uh,

288
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:04,330
but somehow we're allowed to decide
what our limits are and alcohol. Yeah.

289
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:07,370
And when we're not allowed to decide
what our limits are with weed,

290
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:12,130
which is way more than though not fair,
which is way, way physically super Jaime,

291
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:16,490
I stopped drinking for 60 days and it
still was performing in clubs every night

292
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:20,990
and either being not high or high and
when I'm not high or high, I like a drink.

293
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:25,250
Right. You know what I mean? So 60 days,
if not drinking was the hardest thing.

294
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:27,950
Really. No way I take that
back. For the sperm test,

295
00:16:27,951 --> 00:16:31,850
I had to not masturbate for like three
or four days. So that was the hardest.

296
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:35,570
That was the hardest part in
60 days in the first place.

297
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,900
Then the second place is 60 days
and Obas and third place and far,

298
00:16:38,901 --> 00:16:43,310
far third place was 30 days
of not smoking, which was
a pretty easy thing to do.

299
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:45,860
I could do it again tomorrow.
I'm not going to,

300
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,190
cause I've already proved this point.
I could,

301
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:52,760
I could go again for 30 days very easily.
Like if somebody stepped up and said,

302
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:57,500
we'll give you $1 million to go
30 days, no sweat. I take it back,

303
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:01,390
we'll give you $500 and a trip
to Disney world, I can do it.

304
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:05,600
You know, it just has to be something
that I love. Like, uh, you know,

305
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:09,150
I'll forget to smoke weed for a day here
and there. I'll just be like, oh, that's,

306
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:16,160
but it's not like during the day I'm
thinking about it. You know, you're like,

307
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:19,670
that's the thing. You can get
busy and forget to smoke. Yeah.

308
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:24,760
Have withdrawal symptoms of like, shit,
I need a taste. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I,

309
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,620
you know,
for most people,

310
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:30,350
let's say 90 whatever
percent of the population,

311
00:17:30,351 --> 00:17:33,410
marijuana is not physically addictive.
If it is physically addictive,

312
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:37,040
some small percentage of the population
we need, that's a medical issue.

313
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:39,620
We need to figure out what's wrong with
the other person or tests have never

314
00:17:39,621 --> 00:17:43,370
been done because it's a schedule
one narcotic, right? Yeah.

315
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:48,260
So that means they can't even test test
it. It's, it's the most ridiculous.

316
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:50,010
We need this in this crazy

317
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:52,740
sell they can't get out of.
Because you know,

318
00:17:52,741 --> 00:17:57,741
old people and TV commentators need to
all just go away because young people do

319
00:17:58,111 --> 00:18:01,110
not care. Young guilty, do not care about
weed. They don't care about gay marriage.

320
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:04,830
They don't care about a lot of these
issues that are being thrown around right

321
00:18:04,831 --> 00:18:06,810
now that young people are just,

322
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:11,190
whatever these numbers should we do you
want have been around since I was a baby,

323
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:13,500
when I was a child.
I was 11 years old.

324
00:18:13,501 --> 00:18:17,160
My family moved from San Francisco to
Florida and when we lived at San Francisco

325
00:18:17,161 --> 00:18:18,930
came, people were
everywhere. San Francisco,

326
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,270
this squeak weekend with Cobb's
comedy club, but Sam [inaudible],

327
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:25,980
Sam Tripoli and Tom Segura Thompson era.
It's tickets are almost sold out anyway.

328
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:29,190
Um, when, when we were in San Francisco,
we tried to work one of those in later.

329
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:34,230
Just shove it in there, bro. And AAA is
an awesome, I mean, rather San Francisco.

330
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:37,500
I enjoy the shit out of San Francisco
when I lived there. And a triple.

331
00:18:37,501 --> 00:18:38,840
He's an awesome guy too,
but that's beside that.

332
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:40,230
That's a great center on a wrong path.

333
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:43,170
I lived next to some gay people and they
were cool as fuck and they used to get

334
00:18:43,171 --> 00:18:45,720
naked with my aunt. She used to go
over, they would play bongos together.

335
00:18:45,721 --> 00:18:49,560
I've told the story and they would
smoke weed and so gay people to me,

336
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:52,950
you have a drink. Gave people to me
were just like, this guy is black.

337
00:18:52,951 --> 00:18:55,590
This guy's giving me, this guy is
from Guatemala. This guy is Chinese.

338
00:18:55,591 --> 00:18:56,281
It's just a different,

339
00:18:56,281 --> 00:19:00,660
why do you have to blacks and
Guatemalans and Chinese like that, dude,

340
00:19:00,661 --> 00:19:04,710
I did and I pumped them up. Yeah,
it's, yeah, it's all the same.

341
00:19:04,711 --> 00:19:07,290
It's one that says that's what
young people think that you know,

342
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:11,400
the young people are really in the
melting pot because every kid is half this

343
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,650
and half of that these days.
You know his parents though,

344
00:19:13,651 --> 00:19:18,100
there's more and more of all the
ethnicities. It's growing, you know? Yeah.

345
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,970
This country is really
going to change drastically.

346
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,600
But this argument of them being able to
be married, it's been going on forever.

347
00:19:24,601 --> 00:19:27,660
When I was 11 we had moved from San
Francisco to Florida and I was hanging out

348
00:19:27,661 --> 00:19:29,670
with my friend,
candy Esposito.

349
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:34,290
Candy was a Cuban kid and his dad was
yelling and throwing the paper down and we

350
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:37,330
walked in the room and I was like,
fuck, what happened? You know,

351
00:19:37,331 --> 00:19:39,450
and this guy's mad.
Some shit must have went down.

352
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:44,130
And so someone says what happened? And he
goes, fucking fags, want to get married.

353
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:47,490
He believed this shit and he's holding
up a newspaper. And I'm like, wow.

354
00:19:47,491 --> 00:19:49,470
And I'm 11 and I'm looking at this guy,
I'm going,

355
00:19:49,471 --> 00:19:52,610
I don't believe this mother Fucker's
a dad. And I was thinking like,

356
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:56,790
thank God you know this,
this asshole isn't guiding me in life.

357
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:00,450
He's sitting here getting angry and
throwing his newspaper down like a fool

358
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:05,040
because some gay guys want to get married.
So that was like fucking,

359
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:07,680
I was 11 I'm 43 do the math.

360
00:20:07,681 --> 00:20:10,620
That's a long ass time ago and
it's still going on. Hang on.

361
00:20:10,621 --> 00:20:11,700
I need a pen and paper.

362
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:18,040
I have to do the math 40 32 but you
won't have to do any math at my show on

363
00:20:18,661 --> 00:20:22,260
Sunday at flappers in
Burbank,

364
00:20:22,261 --> 00:20:24,860
California for 20 in the afternoon show.
And if you're doing,

365
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:29,160
if you're after and you're going out
of town, right? Yeah. What Day is this?

366
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:33,090
This Sunday? Sunday. Sunday. I
might be back not doing Sunday,

367
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:37,200
Thursday, Friday, Saturday and
I fly back. I might do that.

368
00:20:37,201 --> 00:20:41,520
I might go to your show that often
because I have to. Yeah, I might do that.

369
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,700
I flying in at like 9:00
AM so yeah, it's, you know,

370
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:48,280
it's my interruption podcast.
Oh, you're doing a podcast.

371
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:51,400
But we did a comic out and we just
basically fuck around for a few minutes,

372
00:20:51,401 --> 00:20:53,770
read some tweets and talk about stuff.

373
00:20:53,771 --> 00:20:56,470
I mean it's like basically what we're
doing right now, but with an audience,

374
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:59,050
I don't, I don't really heckle
you as much as you just, you know,

375
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,090
just fuck around together. Yeah.
Yeah. It's like an interview,

376
00:21:01,091 --> 00:21:06,040
but you're standing and I'm sitting and
flappers is perfect. Been awesome menu.

377
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:08,420
Their food there is so delicious.
So if you go there,

378
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,790
study the thing I'm trying to,

379
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:13,180
I've been trying to tell them as they're
going to sell a lot of food that that

380
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:16,220
afternoon they should batten
the hatches or you know,

381
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:20,080
whatever expression you should tired
their lines at what point in time,

382
00:21:20,081 --> 00:21:24,310
just the four 20 thing become hacky. Does
it get to a certain point? We, you know,

383
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:28,060
when you see a dude's cross screen name
on your message board, it's Doug for 20.

384
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,160
Oh,
that guy's probably an idiot.

385
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:35,170
It's like if you've got a girls' email
address and her an email addresses,

386
00:21:35,171 --> 00:21:37,450
you know, whatever,
you know, uh, you know,

387
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:41,260
Barbara 69,
that girl's a slut,

388
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:42,873
you know what I'm saying?

389
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,760
Or at least that's certainly the
impression she wants to give off.

390
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,620
She wants to let you
know there's that action.

391
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:53,080
People are proud of smoking thought I,
I'm proud of it too, but I've never,

392
00:21:53,081 --> 00:21:55,750
I've never really tried to put
it front and center. You know,

393
00:21:55,751 --> 00:21:59,380
it sort of became that. We tried to put
it for you did the marijuana logs? No.

394
00:21:59,381 --> 00:22:02,110
I mean, but the jokes were
like, you know, they weren't,

395
00:22:02,111 --> 00:22:04,030
it wasn't like a OneNote show.

396
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:07,200
We went off in lots of
different directions.

397
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,910
Got To say that you put marijuana
pretty front and center though dude.

398
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:11,890
And it's a good thing in terms of that.
Yeah,

399
00:22:11,891 --> 00:22:13,930
I wrote a play a play about
it with two other dudes,

400
00:22:13,931 --> 00:22:17,700
but like we just all just happen to have
pot jokes in our acts and then we're

401
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,660
like let's just pull them together.
So we did,

402
00:22:19,661 --> 00:22:23,590
we wrote a little bit of extra material
but I'm just saying that like pot jokes,

403
00:22:23,591 --> 00:22:27,220
I've always been in my act just cause
then I'm honest about it and it's part of

404
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:31,530
my life. So that's why it was there and
then people liked it. So then you know,

405
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:35,110
you obviously talk more about the
things that people want to hear about.

406
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:38,950
It's a thing where people who don't smoke
pot get upset at people that smoke a

407
00:22:38,951 --> 00:22:41,740
lot of pot and talk a lot about
it all the time. They get upset.

408
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:45,430
I know lots of people don't find
it to be interesting conversation.

409
00:22:45,431 --> 00:22:48,960
And the reason we like it is
because we're high. You know. So I,

410
00:22:48,961 --> 00:22:52,450
I've had that problem with people out
on the road. He said I'm a different,

411
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:56,560
I'm on a different level than they are
for my enthusiasm for talking about weed.

412
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:59,200
Cause obviously I already
have to talk about it a lot.

413
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:01,990
So somebody comes up to me and they
want to talk about movies or something.

414
00:23:01,991 --> 00:23:04,450
I'm kind of excited because
everybody just wants to say,

415
00:23:04,451 --> 00:23:07,960
what's your favorite strain? You
know, have you ever been to Amsterdam?

416
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:11,140
And that Shit's fun to talk
about. But it's like, you know,

417
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:13,390
just gets repetitive and you know,

418
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:17,650
and also they want to do a lot of
the talking. So you go, there's,

419
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:20,890
you have to do a lot of listening
sometimes, which is, you know, yeah.

420
00:23:20,891 --> 00:23:22,990
They want to tell you if
they can be fun sometimes.

421
00:23:22,991 --> 00:23:27,160
But like remember I remember the guy at
the end of the line and I'm in Toronto

422
00:23:27,161 --> 00:23:31,390
that had some conspiracy theory for them.
We talked about, oh that's so funny.

423
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:35,830
He was young. It was crazy.
You saw that back me up.

424
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:38,140
How crazy it was that done. Yeah,
that was wild. I mean, I was like,

425
00:23:38,141 --> 00:23:41,830
eventually I was like, Joe, we got to,
um, you know, we have this thing to go.

426
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:44,530
The bouncer was pulling him away and
he's like, no, you don't understand.

427
00:23:44,531 --> 00:23:48,600
I have to communicate with them this
information. It was like grabbing him,

428
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,350
pulling him away. It's like,
no, no, no, I'm, I'm going to
stay. I have to talk to him.

429
00:23:51,351 --> 00:23:55,250
See the email I posted? Yes. It's fucking
ridiculous. The most ridiculous. Yeah.

430
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,840
But you know,
it was just one of a million.

431
00:23:56,841 --> 00:23:58,100
There's a million guys
out there like that.

432
00:23:58,101 --> 00:24:01,580
And it's because of me talking
about psychedelic drugs
and talking about DMT and

433
00:24:01,581 --> 00:24:05,960
weed and stuff like that. I get these
people, they find me like a magnet.

434
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:09,140
The only thing that keeps you from being
more aggressive about it is because I'm

435
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:12,590
a comedian and I'm kind of talk
about them. Probably black plastic.

436
00:24:12,591 --> 00:24:15,970
Play the podcast on the schizo radio
channel on Sirius. There's a skid.

437
00:24:15,971 --> 00:24:18,440
So radio check. What are you talking
to me? This is what it seems like that,

438
00:24:18,441 --> 00:24:23,280
that the, the guy from, uh, was
it, uh, uh, shit. Labrea no,

439
00:24:23,281 --> 00:24:26,050
I know one of the local California
clubs. You remember the, there,

440
00:24:26,051 --> 00:24:29,510
there was a guy that came up that thought
we recorded and it was like we weren't

441
00:24:29,511 --> 00:24:31,760
going to put it online
because it was too crazy,

442
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:35,080
but it sounded like the same guy
that you just talked to recorded.

443
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:38,730
What are you talking about? Uh, some guy
came up to you in line. You used to stone,

444
00:24:38,731 --> 00:24:40,280
right?
Completely lost you.

445
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:42,830
Some guy came in line with what
you were signing autographs.

446
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:43,611
I don't know if you remember him.

447
00:24:43,611 --> 00:24:46,550
He came up to you and start
talking like he was like, uh Oh,

448
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:49,610
I know what you're talking about.
Yeah, it was in, yeah, yeah, yeah.

449
00:24:49,611 --> 00:24:51,570
And I didn't want to talk about
it. It's too annoying. Yeah,

450
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:55,230
but it seems like you have like this
whole like weird group of people.

451
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:57,140
You're going to get that man.
Doug gets that too.

452
00:24:57,170 --> 00:25:01,190
You're going to end anytime when
you're in any sort of a public forum,

453
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:03,260
whether it's a podcast,
a TV show, anything.

454
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:06,620
There's eyes on you and as
a certain amount of them
are not going to be healthy.

455
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:10,370
That was the most horrible
sentence structure I ever
did since the, by the way,

456
00:25:10,371 --> 00:25:13,820
sorry, you might be retarded. You
ain't want to go to a doctor. You know,

457
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:18,650
you know who, who's retarded. If you guys
followed any of these la reporters, uh,

458
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:22,850
like, like the news in La
is completely different than
like, uh, like news in Ohio.

459
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,970
Like I was watching something the
other day and I found it online.

460
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:29,080
This is a on the shake weight and
you know the shake weight thing that,

461
00:25:29,081 --> 00:25:30,380
that South Park and everyone dies,

462
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:32,150
right where the shake where it
looks like you've eaten off.

463
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:36,380
This is morning news in La. Okay.
Just listen to how crazy this is.

464
00:25:36,381 --> 00:25:40,160
A visual thing or see the infomercial.
Maybe you've seen it. Parody and uh,

465
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:42,250
they're called shake
weights while she's talking.

466
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,650
The guys using it there now the
focus of a brand, he's holding it.

467
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:47,261
That is right.

468
00:25:47,261 --> 00:25:51,970
Allan Mckay is shaking with excitement
at the prospect of taking part of this

469
00:25:51,971 --> 00:25:56,500
new shake weight class. An alley sounds
good. Dog to go slow or better to go fast.

470
00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:01,330
Get the point. I think you and
you kind of bury it, bury it.

471
00:26:01,331 --> 00:26:04,630
You don't know how you're, you're
doing, what's that noise man?

472
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,010
That's sound effect.

473
00:26:06,011 --> 00:26:10,160
They can have a little mirror on the top.

474
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:17,430
Is that where the cooldown
spray comes out? No,

475
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:22,830
actually all on south park but brought
that up and it went out live mode.

476
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:24,220
Trains.
Yeah.

477
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:28,740
It's mark here and they asked me to
join in but I've got a small white one

478
00:26:28,741 --> 00:26:31,570
because I make a difference.
No,

479
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:36,100
I don't actually think
it's the size of it.

480
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:41,230
It's actually the technique
and Kay, thank you. Thank you.

481
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:44,160
Come attracting tracking
that at all of men at home.

482
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,780
We're wondering that as well.
Not Chris Cause he,

483
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:51,410
he told me he had the
big black one. Yeah, he

484
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:54,050
says they pretty much had it.
Well it goes on a little bit more.

485
00:26:54,051 --> 00:26:57,980
Nothing too funny by they go on like they
actually said that he has a big black

486
00:26:57,981 --> 00:27:01,170
dick the whole time.
The black reporters like shaking it super.

487
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:05,480
Ever do a morning TV when you're
on the road. No, I stopped.

488
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:07,940
It was too ridiculous. So silly. It's on.

489
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,000
It's like you're in a sketch about a bad
TV show about censorship and oh yeah.

490
00:27:13,491 --> 00:27:18,350
It's about how you can't,
yeah, yeah. They're not even
a little crazy little edgy.

491
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:21,110
There's no edginess and like they get
this look, as soon as you get edgy,

492
00:27:21,111 --> 00:27:23,300
they get this look in their eye.
You know the hosts,

493
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:26,360
they just like are flipping
out. Yeah, I stopped doing them.

494
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:28,220
They're just too ridiculous.
You know?

495
00:27:28,221 --> 00:27:32,840
I was doing a fast to give you a really
long lined up and then they ask you one

496
00:27:32,841 --> 00:27:35,010
question and by the time
you're done with your answer,

497
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:38,750
your interviews almost over it. Yeah.
And you do radio before that, like God,

498
00:27:38,751 --> 00:27:43,460
all that stuff is so much this. It's, it's
so much less fun than doing a podcast.

499
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,610
You know the the best that thing about
the podcast and one of the reasons why

500
00:27:46,611 --> 00:27:49,880
these conversations get so weird and go
and sort of so many different places is

501
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:53,870
when we don't have a particular start
or stop time. It just kind of goes,

502
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:56,160
there's not like some commercial
you got to insert in there.

503
00:27:56,161 --> 00:27:57,680
There's not some break.
We have to take,

504
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:02,530
there's not some boss we have to answer
to. There's not some code of words Cunt,

505
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:06,020
nigger. You can say whatever you want. You
can just keep going. It doesn't matter.

506
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,410
I saw one of those the other day. I
can't nigger. What did it look like?

507
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:13,640
Describe it to me. Did it
have high heels? Purple? Um,

508
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:17,280
I'd imagine it would have like high heels,
like an an our chrom comic book. Yeah.

509
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:19,040
Yeah, totally. At high heels.

510
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:26,690
I'm trying to, yes and, but I didn't, I
didn't really see one of those. You could,

511
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:30,170
you know, you could do things today
that you could never do back then.

512
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:33,860
Back then in the old days of comedy when
he had to go to local radio stations,

513
00:28:33,861 --> 00:28:36,980
it was always so painful.
But the worst part about it was the,

514
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:39,830
the TV shows for sure. Cause
they would be, you know,

515
00:28:39,831 --> 00:28:42,560
what you'd have like what's the most
you've ever done on one, seven minutes,

516
00:28:42,561 --> 00:28:46,420
eight minutes, right. Yeah.
And it's just, it's just there.
They asked that, you know,

517
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:49,280
they want, they ask questions that
don't lead to humorous answers.

518
00:28:49,281 --> 00:28:52,190
Where are you from? You know, unless
you've got a chunk about, in my case,

519
00:28:52,191 --> 00:28:54,200
San Diego,
I just always go,

520
00:28:54,201 --> 00:28:56,180
I'm from San Diego and then
they'd say something like, Oh,

521
00:28:56,181 --> 00:28:58,940
it's beautiful down there. Were
you a fan of the Padres? Yeah.

522
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,230
Used to go see if you're getting,
you know,

523
00:29:00,231 --> 00:29:04,700
like you're not getting it anywhere
funny you, you kind of have to take over.

524
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:09,290
Like I always just pick something that's
going on there and just start running

525
00:29:09,291 --> 00:29:13,340
on it right immediately. Like what's with
this guy over here? Yes. Kind of stuff.

526
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,190
Cause and just make it like,
oh this guy's crazy.

527
00:29:16,191 --> 00:29:20,180
We can't even have a conversation with
him because that's all you can do to to

528
00:29:20,181 --> 00:29:24,150
even be kind of funny. Yeah. You got
to sink the ship right away. Yeah.

529
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,050
I'm always like, if they had a
cooking segment, I'm eating whatever.

530
00:29:27,051 --> 00:29:30,650
It was like I'm high out of my mind just
sitting there eating like this is good.

531
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:33,260
What's that? Your phone? Yeah.
Be like this is good right now.

532
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:35,030
Just get some cook it anymore.
Let's just eat.

533
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:39,890
I was in Kentucky and we got a me and
my feature at got interviewed by like a

534
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:42,100
guy,
like a serious news man looking dude

535
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:46,530
who was like in his 50s or 60s
named a, his name was uh, uh,

536
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:51,070
Barry Bernson and uh, and I remember
his name because it was just so amazing.

537
00:29:51,071 --> 00:29:53,350
We went, Oh God, this interview
is going to be brutal.

538
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:55,540
And we sit down and the first
thing out of his mouth is,

539
00:29:55,541 --> 00:29:58,960
did you know that marijuana is the
number one cash crop and Kentucky?

540
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,980
And I was like, [inaudible], I like it.

541
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,710
That is awesome that you would open up
with that question. And he was like,

542
00:30:05,711 --> 00:30:08,230
you know, Mr Newsman
and he knew that. So he,

543
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:11,740
he put it in there and we had a
nice little discussion about it.

544
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:15,410
Is it the number one cash crop in
Kentucky? It's a number one in Hawaii too.

545
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:17,950
That's awesome. I wonder. He supposedly,

546
00:30:17,951 --> 00:30:19,670
it's the number one the
country as far as couch.

547
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:23,320
Doug Stanhope hates the morning news
so bad that I remember when he did this

548
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:26,620
where he took a friend of his,
like the opener comic,

549
00:30:26,621 --> 00:30:29,380
the local opener comic and
told him to go as Doug.

550
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:33,110
So the guy put on sunglasses
difference. Yeah, put sunglasses on.

551
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:35,650
Like I had a trench coat
and I taped the whole thing.

552
00:30:35,651 --> 00:30:38,680
It's like 10 minutes long or something
like that where he goes through a car

553
00:30:38,681 --> 00:30:40,930
show and he was like, we're here
with Doug Stanhope now. Doug,

554
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:44,330
how's it feel to be on the road and
stuff like that. The guys just like, Eh,

555
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:45,420
it feels amazing.

556
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:48,280
But you could pull that off because a
lot of times when you show up at a place,

557
00:30:48,281 --> 00:30:50,770
no one, there is a fan, you
know, they're just like,

558
00:30:50,771 --> 00:30:52,570
they're just doing their job and you know,

559
00:30:52,571 --> 00:30:56,740
some publicists talked him into having
you or whatever and it's so fun.

560
00:30:56,741 --> 00:31:00,040
It's really, it's really crazy doing those
things. I like to do those things with.

561
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,660
I like to bring cameras,

562
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:06,040
like if it's for super high me or the
documentary I did for GE for like,

563
00:31:06,041 --> 00:31:08,230
it just adds that extra,

564
00:31:08,231 --> 00:31:12,560
everyone kind of enhances their
performance a little bit, you know,

565
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:17,080
so like those radio people can look
even crazier or even, you know,

566
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:21,400
even a weirder than they actually are.
Whenever we do radio on the road.

567
00:31:21,401 --> 00:31:25,780
We always do that. We did
in Austin, there's the last
place I do radio was Austin.

568
00:31:25,781 --> 00:31:27,760
Just cause I love them. You
just, you sit and film it. Yeah.

569
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:30,040
We film it and then put it
on the Internet. We put it,

570
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,670
we have this little video blog that
we add along to this podcast thing.

571
00:31:33,671 --> 00:31:37,870
Now we're expanding,
expanding our outreach and uh,

572
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:41,200
we just throw that stuff in there.
And you know, Brian did one in Austin,

573
00:31:41,201 --> 00:31:45,680
the video, what was it called?
Austin Little Austin. A
little awesome. Something,

574
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:47,800
something like that. And
so yeah, it'd be a cap.

575
00:31:47,801 --> 00:31:50,740
See Comedy Club in Austin
on June 1st and second

576
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,100
Dublin plugs.

577
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:57,650
You can't bring up a city with about
me having a gig coming up there. I'm,

578
00:31:57,651 --> 00:32:01,540
I'm going everywhere. Oh yeah. Yeah. Cause
I just go places for a night or two now.

579
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:04,600
I don't do weekends in a pill
in the club. Ever. Ever, ever.

580
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:07,450
What did you start doing this?
Just like in the last year or so?

581
00:32:07,451 --> 00:32:10,220
I just kind of figured it out. They're
like, especially in the winter time,

582
00:32:10,221 --> 00:32:11,100
I only want to,
you know,

583
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:15,220
I'll just bop around Florida
and California and then
the rest of the year I just

584
00:32:15,221 --> 00:32:17,410
hit everywhere else.
So what do you do for Friday and Saturday?

585
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:20,470
Sometimes we'll have a show, but it'd
be like in a rock club or something.

586
00:32:20,471 --> 00:32:23,890
So I don't have to do, I don't have to
do to that night. It's cool. Really.

587
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:27,040
And when did you start doing this? So you
said a year and a half ago I would be,

588
00:32:27,041 --> 00:32:28,960
you know, in the last,
it's been a transition,

589
00:32:28,961 --> 00:32:32,620
but like this year I finally put my foot
down. I just like, unless it's like,

590
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:34,300
you know,
helium in Portland,

591
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,910
the last time I played there I
did five shows where there were,

592
00:32:36,911 --> 00:32:38,890
nobody had said a peep
out of the audience.

593
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:41,530
They were the most amazing
crowds I ever played for. Yeah.

594
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:44,330
It was like when that was one of the last
weekends I was doing a full weekend in

595
00:32:44,331 --> 00:32:46,730
a club.
So I consider doing that again there.

596
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:50,600
But I just don't like to show nights
because you always second show is always

597
00:32:50,601 --> 00:32:53,930
going to be drunker, you know, I
like, I like people at eight o'clock.

598
00:32:53,931 --> 00:32:57,320
I think that's a perfect time for people
to watch a comedy show and it'll be

599
00:32:57,321 --> 00:33:00,440
done by 10 then go then go
get shit. Just, you know,

600
00:33:00,441 --> 00:33:02,780
there's no reason to be shit
faced during the show, you know,

601
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:07,430
use that always ruins it. My people are
always going to be fucked up though. Yeah.

602
00:33:07,431 --> 00:33:10,340
Well those people to accept a
certain level of fucked up and this,

603
00:33:10,341 --> 00:33:11,660
cause I'm going to be fucked up too.

604
00:33:11,661 --> 00:33:16,310
But I'm just saying that like it's easy
to like get really high and then go into

605
00:33:16,311 --> 00:33:19,540
the comedy club and oh I got to get
a couple drinks. All right. You know,

606
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:22,010
give me something that they asked.
They asked for something that's you know,

607
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:25,070
too much and they, so they
ended up being, you know,

608
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:27,560
even worse than the typical
drunk. They're like, uh,

609
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:30,310
someone that doesn't drink that
much being drunk, you know,

610
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:33,710
you've broken these people down
psychologically. Yeah. It's really,

611
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:35,320
it's really interesting. Like, cause uh,

612
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:37,730
most of my audience is just
high and having a good time,

613
00:33:37,731 --> 00:33:42,260
but like it's easy for, you
know, somebody to be like,

614
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:44,510
I get people come up to me
after shows all the time.

615
00:33:44,511 --> 00:33:48,590
I'd never been to a comedy club before
and so I think the idea of like having to

616
00:33:48,591 --> 00:33:52,430
have drinks is overwhelming and you
order like a long island ice tea or some

617
00:33:52,431 --> 00:33:56,150
shit like that that like, you
know, you're going to be a man.

618
00:33:56,151 --> 00:33:57,180
I don't have a straight after it.

619
00:33:57,180 --> 00:34:00,080
You don't have a problem with people
being drunk. I like, I'm drunk.

620
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:04,790
It's definitely part of
the case difference part of
the game for sure. I don't,

621
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:08,030
I would never want to do a show
and I probably have done a few,

622
00:34:08,031 --> 00:34:10,820
but I don't want to do a show where
there's no alcohol being served.

623
00:34:10,821 --> 00:34:13,820
I've done the, I love the alcohol's
being served. I've done those. But yeah,

624
00:34:13,821 --> 00:34:17,600
I agree. Yeah. I've been in like a, you
know, marijuana logs was in a theater,

625
00:34:17,601 --> 00:34:22,220
so nobody was really
drinking. But um, but yeah, I,

626
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:25,700
but I just don't like the whole
comedy club thing of not, uh,

627
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,900
not only are they drunk,

628
00:34:26,901 --> 00:34:30,980
they also possibly just interested
because they just came to see comedy with

629
00:34:30,981 --> 00:34:35,060
quotes around it and they didn't, uh,
you know, bother to research like,

630
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:39,260
like Bachelorette parties. You still have
one of those from time to time. Right.

631
00:34:39,261 --> 00:34:41,210
Because the comedy clubs,
they booked that date.

632
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,100
They didn't book it because
you are going to be there.

633
00:34:43,101 --> 00:34:45,660
That's the night of their
Bachelorette party, you know,

634
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:47,750
and then they go and they
do what they always do,

635
00:34:47,751 --> 00:34:51,200
which has ruined it for every table around
them. Yeah. We had a bad one in Austin.

636
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:53,990
I remember we had those girls kicked out
and the one girl said she was gonna Sue.

637
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:56,340
Why did they even have hubs allowed?

638
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,780
UBERKITTENS cause they want to make some
money, do what they do like the money.

639
00:34:59,781 --> 00:35:02,900
But I do think that that would be cool
if a comedy clubs stepped up and said,

640
00:35:02,901 --> 00:35:03,321
you know what?

641
00:35:03,321 --> 00:35:06,350
No bachelorette parties and a group
of six women want to come down.

642
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:10,730
I refuse to believe that.
All bachelorettes or cons I refuse.

643
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:11,840
I know a lot of good.

644
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:15,950
I've had some good ones and I always
congratulate them because it's a,

645
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,750
it's amazing when they're good.

646
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:21,170
I as soon as I see a Bachelorette party
in the audience, I'm like, oh there's,

647
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:25,190
there's the lady in the Dildo hat that's
had too much to drink and then I'm

648
00:35:25,191 --> 00:35:27,380
going to have to deal with her the
whole show. And it's, you know,

649
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:30,290
cause they want it to be about them.
They don't want, they're not there to,

650
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:33,850
they're not there to share. And a comedian
with the rest of the audience, right.

651
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:35,840
They're there to have
a private performance.

652
00:35:35,841 --> 00:35:38,130
They should just hire us to
come and call them a bunch

653
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:41,730
of, you know, you stupid see words
and then they laugh and give us money.

654
00:35:41,731 --> 00:35:45,600
This is the thing that some women have,
and I want to say women,

655
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:48,090
but dumb checks have, you know,
I know it's not you girls,

656
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:51,390
but there's some of them have where
if it's their birthday or if it's an

657
00:35:51,391 --> 00:35:53,700
anniversary or if it's
their bachelorette party,

658
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:58,940
they feel like they are as to number
one really it's my birthday or like,

659
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:03,060
whoa, reach when it's my birthday.
Don't you get that constantly,

660
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:06,780
but that's a good, but that's on
Twitter. That's not annoying to me,

661
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:11,460
but at a comedy club, how many clubs do
it more than dudes? It was a video of one.

662
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:12,990
The girl,
we got a video of this girl,

663
00:36:12,991 --> 00:36:16,380
she was heckling and then afterwards
we're back at the back of the comedy club

664
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,850
and a, I go, you know,

665
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:22,500
oh, you're such a jerk. You're such a
jerk. And I go, you wouldn't shut up.

666
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,740
And they'll go, hey, it's her
birthday. It's her birthday. I go,

667
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:26,210
you're yelling in the middle of a common.

668
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:31,030
Then she called me fat. I pulled my shirt
up. I'm like, bitch was called Joe Rogan.

669
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,240
Fatso. Yeah, she called me fat and I'm
like, why? Where are you getting fat?

670
00:36:34,241 --> 00:36:36,140
Cause I wear baggy clothes,
you know,

671
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:39,280
a lot of times on stage and aware like
a baggy sweatshirt and I guess she

672
00:36:39,281 --> 00:36:43,810
thought I was covering something
so I had a show where the slabs,

673
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:47,310
I get that same shit all
the time. Yeah, I know man.

674
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:52,120
It was a pretty good judge though.
As far as like own edge videos.

675
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:56,410
It's like 14 seconds of shut the
fuck up and it's like so quick.

676
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,450
It's like a you,
you know why

677
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:01,840
you guys stop. Oh it's your birthday.
You're such a jerk. It's her birthday.

678
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:04,150
I'm like, listen, I'm just a comedian.
You guys wouldn't shut the fuck up

679
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:08,410
fat. You're fat. Like puffer
cheeks out at me. Like wow, rude.

680
00:37:08,411 --> 00:37:12,860
If I was fat with differences that make
it fun, fat, you're still a cunt. It ever,

681
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:13,930
everyone I've met,

682
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:17,290
every single person I've met who said
you were mean to me during a show one day

683
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,440
I say, were you drunk? And then
Diego. Yeah. And then I go,

684
00:37:20,441 --> 00:37:22,990
do you remember anything
that either of US said? No.

685
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:26,980
They just walk away with this impression
that you're the asshole because they

686
00:37:26,981 --> 00:37:30,250
ruined the show and you had him thrown
out or you or you, you know, put,

687
00:37:30,251 --> 00:37:31,084
put them in their place.

688
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:35,200
Do you recognize the obligation that you
have to be a little more nice than the

689
00:37:35,201 --> 00:37:38,920
average person because you're famous
when someone meets you that they're going

690
00:37:38,921 --> 00:37:43,090
to be a little weirded out by it all
and so you have to give them some slack.

691
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:43,631
Yeah,
I know.

692
00:37:43,631 --> 00:37:48,430
That's why I'm always kind of offended
or surprised when people have a different

693
00:37:48,431 --> 00:37:51,220
perception. Like a guy recently
wrote on Twitter, you know,

694
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:54,190
I just got to tell you or was a girl,
but she was like,

695
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:57,370
it was going to tell you you were kind
of a Douche when we met you after your

696
00:37:57,371 --> 00:37:59,860
show and and wherever Dallas or whatever.

697
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:02,800
And it's just like right back and forth
a little bit and you start to get the,

698
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:06,430
oh no, no, they did. You know, they, they
three back down immediately. They don't,

699
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:10,810
they don't really mean like douche sounds
harsher to me than they probably meant

700
00:38:10,811 --> 00:38:15,190
it to be. You know, I've, I've met people
before and not even famous people before,

701
00:38:15,191 --> 00:38:19,180
but I met people when I was younger and
for whatever reason I chose to not like

702
00:38:19,181 --> 00:38:19,961
them.
You know,

703
00:38:19,961 --> 00:38:23,140
like your pick something like something
he said something and you blow it out of

704
00:38:23,141 --> 00:38:26,740
proportion, you make a fucking big deal
out of it. And then it, because you know,

705
00:38:26,741 --> 00:38:30,070
it's like, it's almost like a natural
thing to do when the person's not there,

706
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:33,500
you know, if you're weak, you
know, I had an instance on a,

707
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:36,460
at this website that go
to mixed martial arts.com

708
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:39,370
where I met a guy in an elevator.
Okay.

709
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:42,700
And I didn't even meet him
in the elevator. We were all
in the elevator together.

710
00:38:42,701 --> 00:38:43,840
No one said anything.

711
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:47,740
And apparently on the way out he said
hello where he said something and he

712
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:49,330
doesn't,
doesn't think that I responded.

713
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:54,510
So he went online and wrote this whole
long thing rogue me being a churchy.

714
00:38:56,490 --> 00:39:00,730
Sure wanna be and he's
twice as big as me and fuck,

715
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,500
he was rude to me.

716
00:39:02,501 --> 00:39:06,250
They'd go right into everything
they supposedly hate about you,

717
00:39:06,251 --> 00:39:09,190
but they know it all because they
had liked all those things about you.

718
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:13,210
Like they are a fan and then they just
suddenly, no, this wasn't even realistic.

719
00:39:13,211 --> 00:39:15,940
This, he suddenly turned on
you though the turns so fast.

720
00:39:15,941 --> 00:39:18,730
Well this wasn't even a turn.
I mean this, this was a,

721
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:23,200
just an undoubtedly a guy with issues
undoubtedly of guy with, you know,

722
00:39:23,201 --> 00:39:26,380
he's on a mixed martial arts website.
A lot of those guys have anger issues.

723
00:39:26,381 --> 00:39:29,200
You know, like I have in my past,
I've had a lot of anger issues.

724
00:39:29,201 --> 00:39:33,120
I understand it and you know, it's his
interaction with someone who's, you know,

725
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:34,710
famous and all of a sudden,
you know,

726
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:37,360
he's comparing himself to me and
he's a bigger person than me.

727
00:39:37,361 --> 00:39:40,150
So he's got that over me and then he
feels like he said something to me and I

728
00:39:40,151 --> 00:39:43,240
didn't respond. So it was like fall
camp. So the rest of it was fuck him.

729
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:46,300
And then he gets online and writes this
whole thing and I said, listen man,

730
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:48,340
I don't know what happened,
but if I saw you,

731
00:39:48,341 --> 00:39:51,050
I guarantee you I'm one of the nicest
people you'll ever meet. I saw,

732
00:39:51,051 --> 00:39:54,550
I just turned, my grandmother died and
I was standing in an elevator. Right?

733
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:58,300
It could be anybody. It could be
anything like it. Also just that,

734
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,420
that'd be that crazy to think just because
they're saying it as they leave the

735
00:40:01,421 --> 00:40:05,530
elevator, that that a of response
absolutely must be forthcoming

736
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:10,480
or something. People want you
to be a cunt. They really do.

737
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:13,750
They root for you to suck because if
you're not happy that with the way your

738
00:40:13,751 --> 00:40:16,500
life is going and you meet
somebody that you feel envious of,

739
00:40:16,501 --> 00:40:17,560
where you feel like,
you know,

740
00:40:17,561 --> 00:40:20,790
why is this person in the public eye
and I'm not being the public eyes,

741
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:25,330
a weird fucking thing. And if you're a
guy, a lot of guys wish they were famous,

742
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:30,340
like 99% wish they were something of
significance. Even if they're not,

743
00:40:30,341 --> 00:40:32,680
you know, even if it's not
famous, they want to be wealthy.

744
00:40:32,681 --> 00:40:35,290
They want to be a a man that you admire.

745
00:40:35,291 --> 00:40:39,310
They want to be someone in
a high position. It's just
normal chimpanzee shit.

746
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:42,870
So when you meet some guy and you're
like, who the fuck is this? Doug Benson,

747
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:45,090
we with you? He's not
fucking cool to me. What?

748
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:48,700
I fucking buy your CD fucking shithead.
And you're like,

749
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:53,210
I didn't know you said Hi. Sorry I
was on the phone. They just don't,

750
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:56,220
they open with that stuff. Yeah.
They just walk right out. Oh yeah,

751
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,540
they're looking at you. Yeah.
I guess you're a hot shot, Huh?

752
00:40:58,541 --> 00:41:01,270
Everybody over there has been saying that
you in some sort of movie or something.

753
00:41:01,271 --> 00:41:03,940
Why do you think you're so special?
It's amazing.

754
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:05,830
You know what dude say to me all the time,

755
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:10,900
I thought you were taller all the time
and they want to hang out and be friendly.

756
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,210
We want to see if I thought
you were taller and it's,

757
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:17,950
it's not like there's no sense of,
you know, like social awareness.

758
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:20,920
There's no second. Yeah, I
know. They're totally like,

759
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:22,930
I'll be more interesting
than somebody else,

760
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:27,310
but can go take a ruler mark out
five foot eight on your wall.

761
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:32,590
If you see me, expect me to be
there. That's how tall I am.

762
00:41:32,591 --> 00:41:36,740
I've been this tall for 43 fucking years.
That's fine. People can plan for it.

763
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:40,580
Let's get mean. Do you go up to blind
people and fucking give him the finger?

764
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:44,480
Like what do you do? What are you doing
man, you you getting is a great idea.

765
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,530
They wouldn't even talk a
lot of shit around the deaf,

766
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:51,420
but they would hear the whisper of your
front hand over my mouth and through the

767
00:41:51,421 --> 00:41:54,250
year. What if they grabbed your wrist
and some Steven Seagal constantly.

768
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:57,150
Likewise your finger in front of my face,
mother fucker.

769
00:41:57,530 --> 00:41:59,360
You get your finger in front
of my face because I'm blind.

770
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:03,100
There's a, there's a new blind
guy that's at my Starbucks.

771
00:42:03,101 --> 00:42:06,340
I go to Starbucks everyday so I see the
same people every day kind of thing.

772
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:10,330
And there's a new guy just recently became
blind and I feel bad for him because

773
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,040
he's a little older guy
and stuff like that,

774
00:42:12,041 --> 00:42:16,870
but he's the worst blind
person ever because he says
pretty much groping people.

775
00:42:16,871 --> 00:42:19,720
He's like running into people like
he has the one that sticks and he's a

776
00:42:19,721 --> 00:42:24,721
slapping little kids over is sit there
in line and everyone's just like in shock

777
00:42:25,001 --> 00:42:26,530
ready to just like grab him.

778
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:29,950
Maybe his hearing's not good. And
you know like, uh, like the blind,

779
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:33,160
they say that your hearing gets much
better and you tuned into your senses.

780
00:42:33,161 --> 00:42:37,030
But if he became blind as he got older,
yeah, maybe he's hearing is already bad.

781
00:42:37,031 --> 00:42:37,864
And then he goes blind.

782
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:41,980
Well, I mean there's people like
rearranging Starbucks just so he can walk.

783
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:45,330
How does Aldon all to feel about them?
Any,

784
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:49,100
any issues or weird by the way that I
think about it for people don't know what

785
00:42:49,101 --> 00:42:49,880
we're talking about.

786
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:52,970
Brian was stones and he ran into Alan
Alda and he was pretty sure Alan Alda was

787
00:42:52,971 --> 00:42:55,640
mad dogging them. See, it's
basically what we just talked about.

788
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:57,980
It's like you did it with Alan Alda.
Be like,

789
00:42:57,981 --> 00:43:01,760
fuck out all that he got on the podcast
and double finger. Don't Fuck Allen.

790
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,170
That does look concern.

791
00:43:03,171 --> 00:43:06,980
Like he somehow knew that three 15 year
olds just showed me they're buttholes.

792
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:10,160
Yeah. That was on you though
too. Some girls flashed him.

793
00:43:10,161 --> 00:43:13,910
Some little school girls thought it was
cute to Flash Brian and it was buttholes

794
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:17,720
and vaginas. There was, everyone
was end vaginas. The whole package.

795
00:43:17,721 --> 00:43:18,560
The whole package.
Well,

796
00:43:18,561 --> 00:43:22,070
it's good because if it wasn't just a
butthole and nothing else and you'd be

797
00:43:22,071 --> 00:43:24,320
like, what the fuck are you
trying to, is this a cry for help?

798
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:26,540
Is this a flesh colored SOS?

799
00:43:26,541 --> 00:43:30,830
Heine I'll tell you something about
Alan Alda though. I hope. Please do it.

800
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:34,070
Doesn't do autographs.
Doesn't really, yeah, so that,

801
00:43:34,071 --> 00:43:36,470
say anybody that meets him could
walk away going, what a Dick.

802
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:37,940
Because he just says,

803
00:43:37,941 --> 00:43:41,420
I'd rather just shake your
hand or whatever and I'd
rather shake someone's hand

804
00:43:41,421 --> 00:43:43,680
to, but if they want me to
write something down I'll,

805
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,710
I'll be happy too because
then they can remember it.

806
00:43:45,711 --> 00:43:46,850
They look at it and they remember it.

807
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:50,620
It's just the only problem with autographs
and shit like that and photos like

808
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:53,690
especially the only time I really
ever an issue with it is that the UFC,

809
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:56,720
because sometimes I just can't do it.
Like when I'm working,

810
00:43:56,750 --> 00:43:59,030
you know you've been in the UFC cage side,

811
00:43:59,031 --> 00:44:01,790
I'm supposed to stay cage side and
these people was like, come over,

812
00:44:01,791 --> 00:44:03,740
take a picture of like the fights
are going to start in one minute.

813
00:44:03,741 --> 00:44:07,160
I can't just one. I can't do just
one because you look behind you,

814
00:44:07,161 --> 00:44:08,330
there's a thousand people.

815
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:12,080
I can't just take one and you know
sometimes like you got to go to press

816
00:44:12,081 --> 00:44:14,990
conferences and there you have to run
through these people like I'm sorry I have

817
00:44:14,991 --> 00:44:16,310
to go.
That's the only time.

818
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:18,920
But other times I see people and
making them happy to sign your shit.

819
00:44:18,921 --> 00:44:20,660
I'll pass on people.
When I was a little kid,

820
00:44:20,661 --> 00:44:22,520
ace freely signed a piece of paper for me,
man,

821
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:25,640
and I washed it accidentally
like a retard, but I,

822
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:29,870
it was so faint I could still see it.
So I went over it with a sharpie.

823
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:34,680
I went over the very careful cause I
wasn't an artist very carefully with a

824
00:44:34,681 --> 00:44:38,670
sharpie and then my aunt I, you know, she
goes, did you go over it with a marker?

825
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,920
And I said, yeah, and you
know what she said? She goes,

826
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:43,860
it's not going to be worth as
much now. I'm like, what a,

827
00:44:43,861 --> 00:44:46,290
can't put a negative comment.

828
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:50,040
My mom sold my Bob hope autograph
and a garage sale for 5 cents.

829
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:53,880
She sold it to at five
sentence when I met Bob Hope,

830
00:44:53,881 --> 00:44:56,880
I also met Sean Connery at that
person made like, you know,

831
00:44:56,881 --> 00:44:58,270
10 or 15 more cents on it.

832
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:02,500
Why would you sell your autographed
copy of Bob Hope's autograph?

833
00:45:02,501 --> 00:45:06,420
She just took all my books and she's like,
I'm just getting rid of it.

834
00:45:06,421 --> 00:45:10,740
And I had a book that had a Sean
Connery and Bob Hope's autograph on it.

835
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:13,710
It was a like a guide
to this golf tournament,

836
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:15,750
like one of those program
guides or whatever.

837
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:19,230
And they were assigned both of it and
they were really cool autographs and she

838
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:23,710
sold it like a whole box of books for
Torrey Pines, that tournament? No,

839
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:26,580
it's called the memorial tournament in
Columbus, Ohio. It's like once a year.

840
00:45:26,581 --> 00:45:29,160
It's like Jack Nicklaus and
started it and it's pretty big one.

841
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:32,370
It's all the celebrities used to always
go there and kind of a weak move by your

842
00:45:32,371 --> 00:45:36,250
mother. I went to one down south.
Where are they? They did it every year.

843
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:40,350
I'd go with my dad and I get pictures of
the weirdest celebrities and of course

844
00:45:40,351 --> 00:45:41,250
Bob hope was there,

845
00:45:41,251 --> 00:45:44,550
so I got to have a picture of like I
hate stood in front of is a golf cart.

846
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:48,000
Oh really? Yeah. And uh, they had to
kind of yell at me, get out of the way,

847
00:45:48,610 --> 00:45:52,930
but I got the shot. I was like,
yeah, I was eating very, a young pup.

848
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:55,550
Razzi he signed my
autograph it with anything.

849
00:45:55,650 --> 00:45:57,400
There was a big crowd and
he just went right to me.

850
00:45:57,401 --> 00:46:00,570
He didn't sign anyone else's autografting
got [inaudible] you got kid guy.

851
00:46:00,571 --> 00:46:05,160
OCD is fun on Twitter. Reminded me that
the chicken Austin who was heckling,

852
00:46:05,161 --> 00:46:09,300
who was the Bachelorette was screaming.
Sarah Pailin is my aunt.

853
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:15,510
She was telling me that Sarah Palin
was her aunt. Like she has some power.

854
00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:19,630
Do you say normally or what is she
saying? God, I say aunt [inaudible].

855
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,760
I say aunt cause it was so funny.

856
00:46:22,830 --> 00:46:26,790
You don't say Aston Fundraising Austin
to yell on cause it sounds so proper.

857
00:46:26,970 --> 00:46:30,510
Right? Wait, wait. Yeah.

858
00:46:30,511 --> 00:46:34,020
I say Anna Nerissa heard aunt.
There's a u in there bro on now.

859
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:37,470
But my friend Dmitri said it best because
I was trying to figure out what is

860
00:46:37,471 --> 00:46:39,570
right, what is wrong and he
said there's a u in there.

861
00:46:39,570 --> 00:46:41,400
That's why I say [inaudible]. I'm
like God damn it. You're right.

862
00:46:41,401 --> 00:46:45,030
And we gave knuckles to each
other. We both agreed on is. It is.

863
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:50,130
So you also go with often over often?
No, I think I said it was a t in there.

864
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:55,290
I say often I allow science, silent
t's. I don't allow silent use.

865
00:46:55,350 --> 00:46:58,110
Those sound used can go fuck themselves.
That's what I say.

866
00:46:58,770 --> 00:47:02,940
You got your own set of rules. My
rules, we already have an answer. Okay.

867
00:47:02,970 --> 00:47:07,170
We've got plenty of yours to need more
confused than the English language.

868
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:09,690
Apparently the English language is a
motherfucker if you come from another

869
00:47:09,691 --> 00:47:11,100
language,
but man,

870
00:47:11,101 --> 00:47:14,280
you know what to me is a motherfucker's
any Asian language where they have

871
00:47:14,281 --> 00:47:19,020
characters. It's supposed to be good
for you to learn other languages.

872
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,780
You know it's supposed to be a
conversation. If you're young,

873
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:24,940
I'm this close to pulling the trigger on
just getting a Rosetta stone for some,

874
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:26,860
you know,
Spanish or something and download it.

875
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:31,120
Really trying to learn another one. I love
the Latino culture. I would love to do,

876
00:47:31,121 --> 00:47:35,620
if I had enough Spanish to do a Latino
comedy shows, I think that'd be cool.

877
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:39,400
I would love to do that. I'd love to do
some Chels Latino shows with Joey Diaz,

878
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:43,570
but I would have to open shitty Spanish.
Let's seriously Joe it.

879
00:47:43,571 --> 00:47:46,540
Let's learn Spanish and then do some
shows. How long would it take for us?

880
00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:50,470
I Dunno. My Buddy learned Portuguese
and Rosetta stone and like a few months.

881
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:54,430
Really? Did he get Brazil or Portugal?
Uh, Brazil. Wow, that's awesome.

882
00:47:54,490 --> 00:47:58,120
They have a different flavor of a
Portuguese cause I've heard people speak

883
00:47:58,121 --> 00:48:02,110
Portuguese and Brazilian sounds so
much cooler, like catch Italian,

884
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:05,590
such a wild country. Brazilians are mad
at me. There's a few that don't get it.

885
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:10,750
They're upset at my toxoplasma
comments. I love Brazil. I'm a,

886
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:12,490
I'm a brown belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.

887
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:16,480
I've been studying it since 1996 I
have a ton of Brazilian friends chew.

888
00:48:16,481 --> 00:48:20,060
Hoss Korea's from those. The fogo de
Chao. That's my favorite. All time food.

889
00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:23,820
And you're going to be there. It's
29th. I might not. I might be giving my,

890
00:48:23,830 --> 00:48:28,010
I might be getting my tonsils removed my
titles and my adenoids. Yeah. I, you know,

891
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:29,410
I have sleep apnea.

892
00:48:29,810 --> 00:48:32,800
I have to sleep with a mouth piece and
I've just broke it the other day when I

893
00:48:32,801 --> 00:48:36,490
was in Toronto and had a glue this
fucking thing together with Krazy glue.

894
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:40,240
And Kevin Booth, uh, the guy
was bill Hicks, producer.

895
00:48:40,241 --> 00:48:44,080
He produced my first DVD that we filmed
in Austin and he just got the operation

896
00:48:44,081 --> 00:48:47,260
time and he told me it's awesome and
he can breathe so much better now.

897
00:48:47,290 --> 00:48:50,230
And I have, I have a fat neck
man. I have a big tongue.

898
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:52,810
And what they do is when my,
when I go to sleep,

899
00:48:52,811 --> 00:48:57,040
my tongue like closes over my air
hole and it, you know, you, you,

900
00:48:57,220 --> 00:49:00,700
you choke and you gag. So I have this
mouthpiece. It keeps my tongue in place.

901
00:49:00,850 --> 00:49:03,730
But if the mouthpiece breaks, I'm
fucked. And then I don't sleep right.

902
00:49:03,910 --> 00:49:06,190
And then I wake up a bunch of times
in the middle of the night because I'm

903
00:49:06,191 --> 00:49:10,670
coughing. It's like 34 times an
hour. My sleep gets interrupted by,

904
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:13,450
by choking and gagging.
It's like some pretty serious shit.

905
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:17,440
It's like every two minutes I'm choking.
So, um, I have to do something about it.

906
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:20,890
And this is a, that's a good stretch
of time. So if I have that operation,

907
00:49:21,070 --> 00:49:22,660
I probably won't be in Brazil.

908
00:49:22,810 --> 00:49:25,210
But the point is all these Brazilian
people got mad at me the other day on

909
00:49:25,211 --> 00:49:28,440
Twitter. They were like,
Yo, you're talking all these
sheets about Brazil. You know,

910
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:32,490
because I said the toxoplasma
makes is 66% of Brazil's infected.

911
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:36,070
It might be as high as 80% of that belief
and that it makes men aggressive and

912
00:49:36,071 --> 00:49:38,500
then it doesn't have the same effect
on women and in fact makes it more

913
00:49:38,501 --> 00:49:39,610
submissive.
And the,

914
00:49:39,611 --> 00:49:43,270
they've actually found a
direct correlation between
successful soccer teams and

915
00:49:43,271 --> 00:49:47,050
toxoplasma infesting
infections because this,

916
00:49:47,051 --> 00:49:50,980
this parasite actually makes people
aggressive and make people reckless.

917
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:53,350
And that's why I said it's like mean
think when you think about Brazil,

918
00:49:53,351 --> 00:49:56,050
you think about these wild motherfuckers
and you think about these beautiful

919
00:49:56,051 --> 00:49:56,710
women.
And I'm like,

920
00:49:56,710 --> 00:50:01,660
how crazy is it that 60% of this
country is infected more by this,

921
00:50:01,661 --> 00:50:02,830
this toxo plasma?

922
00:50:03,010 --> 00:50:06,640
And then you find out that there's other
strains of this shit and that it's not

923
00:50:06,641 --> 00:50:10,960
just, it's also, by the way, 60 million
Americans are infected by this shit too.

924
00:50:11,230 --> 00:50:14,920
So I'm not like shitting on Brazil
when I'm talking about is some weird,

925
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:18,820
it's like thinking about nationalism at
this point is the most ridiculous thing

926
00:50:18,821 --> 00:50:22,960
to do because what you should be thinking
about is that there's a brain parasite,

927
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:25,880
a parasite that affects the
way your fucking brain works.

928
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:30,650
In 66% of Brazil's infected by
80% of France is infected by it.

929
00:50:30,770 --> 00:50:33,710
60 million Americans. And
these people are like, Oh,

930
00:50:33,711 --> 00:50:35,150
you've tooken all this shits about Brazil.

931
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,640
And I don't know if it's
a translation issue.

932
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:40,640
I don't know if they just have it and
they're pissed. They're screaming at you.

933
00:50:41,270 --> 00:50:44,120
Could be that. It could hurt,
effected. It could be that.

934
00:50:44,121 --> 00:50:45,590
But I think it's a nationalism thing too.

935
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:47,450
I think if they don't understand
the language very well,

936
00:50:47,451 --> 00:50:49,760
they can get confused and think
that I'm talking shit on Brazil.

937
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:52,670
So the last thing we'll do, why would
I do that? So fucking awesome country.

938
00:50:52,671 --> 00:50:55,700
It's a wild country. It's the country
of one of my favorite things to do.

939
00:50:55,701 --> 00:51:00,200
Brazilian Jujitsu. If it wasn't for the
Brazilians, man wasn't for the one family,

940
00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:03,170
that Gracie family and all
of the off shoots. You know,

941
00:51:03,171 --> 00:51:06,170
everyone who learned under that, my
ada dude, everyone who learns Jujitsu.

942
00:51:06,350 --> 00:51:10,010
What a fascinating group of human beings.
They literally changed martial arts.

943
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:12,470
You know,
I did martial arts my whole life dude.

944
00:51:12,650 --> 00:51:17,650
And up until 1993 no one had
any idea what Jujitsu was.

945
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:18,590
No one had an,

946
00:51:18,590 --> 00:51:21,110
there was a few people that knew
like a few gene labelle's out there.

947
00:51:21,111 --> 00:51:23,600
And guys who knew about judo.
I knew wrestlers,

948
00:51:23,601 --> 00:51:27,110
you could take it down and you know,
I'd heard a choke holds and stuff before,

949
00:51:27,111 --> 00:51:31,360
but there was nothing
like as comprehensive as
Brazilian Jujitsu as you know,

950
00:51:31,410 --> 00:51:34,160
exhibited by hoists. Gracie, when
you first entered into the octagon,

951
00:51:34,161 --> 00:51:38,990
that fucking blew everybody's mind.
And it's one bad ass family from Brazil.

952
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:43,250
Ilial Gracie, the old man of, of
Brazil. It was such a bad motherfucker.

953
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:48,020
He had like 16 sons or something crazy.
And they're all killers. They're all,

954
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:52,880
he like made an army of, of black
belt killers. Every one of his sons.

955
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:56,960
Holys Helson uh, all of
them fucking Hickson. The,

956
00:51:56,961 --> 00:52:01,430
all of his sons were these bad ass
savages that could strangle you. I mean,

957
00:52:01,431 --> 00:52:03,600
it's amazing.
They're cousins Carlson.

958
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:06,940
It's like there's all these fucking other
people in, in, in, in involved in the,

959
00:52:06,941 --> 00:52:10,700
in the family tree. Everybody connected.
Like what a weird, a weird place.

960
00:52:10,701 --> 00:52:12,710
What an amazing thing that something is.

961
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:17,730
[inaudible] this one guy and his family
gave birth to this revolution in martial

962
00:52:18,111 --> 00:52:21,200
arts. Like fuck all the other
martial artists throughout history.

963
00:52:21,201 --> 00:52:25,370
No one's ever had the kind of
contribution that this one families had.

964
00:52:25,550 --> 00:52:28,430
The Gracie family has done something
like when you talk about like the,

965
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:30,170
the biggest contributors to martial arts,

966
00:52:30,350 --> 00:52:33,860
there's no one who's even close to them.
No one comes close.

967
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:37,940
There's people who have helped and karate
and it's more time masters and there's

968
00:52:37,941 --> 00:52:41,050
people perfected boxing. There's great
wrestlers, there's all these great.

969
00:52:41,210 --> 00:52:45,560
But as far as like one influential family,
no one can fuck with the Gracies.

970
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:47,460
It's amazing.
Have you been tinkering?

971
00:52:47,461 --> 00:52:51,690
The lady called you fat and you
just met your neck. Yeah. Have you,

972
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:54,680
have you been tested for toxic
plastic? Me. Just for fun. Just to,

973
00:52:54,710 --> 00:52:56,780
maybe you've been hanging out with
all these Brazilians and stuff.

974
00:52:56,781 --> 00:53:01,130
Maybe they sneeze like you get it that
way, bro. I'll get it from cats. The cats.

975
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:03,890
Maybe they had cat feral cats. You have
to be very careful with feral cats.

976
00:53:03,891 --> 00:53:06,600
A lot of feral cats have
it and uh, it's uh, it's,

977
00:53:06,601 --> 00:53:08,840
they get it from killing
rats and the way it works.

978
00:53:08,841 --> 00:53:12,230
I've talked about this before
on the podcast. So in, in
the interest of brevity,

979
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:14,720
just look up toxo plasma on Google.

980
00:53:14,721 --> 00:53:18,730
The short version is it's a parasite that
affects rats and it makes them lose it.

981
00:53:18,770 --> 00:53:22,160
They lose their fear of cats and it makes
them horny for the smell of cat piss.

982
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:25,620
It rewires their bra. They go
near the cat, the cat them.

983
00:53:25,621 --> 00:53:29,850
Then the cat gets this toxoplasma cat
shits in the grass. Animals get it.

984
00:53:29,851 --> 00:53:33,480
You eat the animal, you get it,
you touch the cat shit, you get it.

985
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:34,800
You know the cat feces.

986
00:53:34,801 --> 00:53:38,590
Somehow like cat cats lay their dirty
asses on your kitchen table or they clean

987
00:53:38,591 --> 00:53:41,490
themselves. And if you drop a cookie
on that and then you eat that cookie,

988
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:43,830
you could easily get some
cat feces and your food.

989
00:53:43,831 --> 00:53:46,410
You'd be amazed if you have
cats where you have cat feces,

990
00:53:46,411 --> 00:53:48,310
you probably have it all
on your phones everywhere.

991
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:49,970
They scraped the cat
litter box and they didn't.

992
00:53:49,971 --> 00:53:52,000
They'd lay in there around
and then they walk around.

993
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:55,860
He sees went right in my mouth the second
I walked in there. Dirty little cons.

994
00:53:55,890 --> 00:54:00,450
But you know, the bottom line is,
the real concern is feral cats.

995
00:54:00,451 --> 00:54:03,210
If you have cats that don't leave your
house, you don't have to worry about it.

996
00:54:03,390 --> 00:54:04,470
But if you have feral cats,

997
00:54:04,590 --> 00:54:08,520
there's videos online of cat of rats
that are infected by Toxo and they run

998
00:54:08,521 --> 00:54:12,160
right up to cats and jump on them. They
don't give a fuck about cats. There's,

999
00:54:12,161 --> 00:54:14,010
or there's a crazy video of a rat.

1000
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:18,120
There's like three cats and it's an
outdoor rat and this rat runs up to these

1001
00:54:18,121 --> 00:54:21,210
cats and just starts jumping up in the
air and like snapping at these cats.

1002
00:54:21,211 --> 00:54:22,260
He's not scared of him at all.

1003
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:24,390
And the cats are freaking out and
they don't even know to kill him.

1004
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:29,370
They'll look for, they don't such bizarre
behavior. So my friends in Brazil,

1005
00:54:29,610 --> 00:54:32,630
I love you relax the Fogo
de Chao talking shit.

1006
00:54:32,650 --> 00:54:34,770
I'm not talking shit about Brazil.
I love Brazil.

1007
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:36,960
I got all these fights between fuck you,

1008
00:54:36,961 --> 00:54:39,630
Joe Rogan and all this crazy
shit in Portuguese too. I'm like,

1009
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:43,900
please people relax. It's
Americans to 60 million. It's,

1010
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:47,580
you need to be concerned about this
fucking thing and people need to protect

1011
00:54:47,581 --> 00:54:50,850
their kids and you need to protect babies
because when babies get it, it's very,

1012
00:54:50,851 --> 00:54:53,760
very dangerous. Pregnant
women get it. It's very,

1013
00:54:53,761 --> 00:54:56,150
very dangerous when pregnant women,
uh,

1014
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:58,680
that's one of the things that
doctors tell them very specifically.

1015
00:54:58,830 --> 00:55:02,430
Do not fuck with litter boxes when you're
pregnant because if you get that toxo

1016
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:07,640
they're just learning about this stuff,
man. Their Geo Xo, toxic plasma May.

1017
00:55:07,990 --> 00:55:12,570
Yeah. Toxoplasma Gondii
or Toxo. Plasmosis it's a,

1018
00:55:12,571 --> 00:55:15,610
it's some creepy shit, man.
And you know crazy. Yeah.

1019
00:55:15,630 --> 00:55:19,350
I never heard about it until a couple
tough years ago. He said, I'll get tested.

1020
00:55:19,950 --> 00:55:22,250
Take bets. See. I probably haven't.

1021
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:24,930
You think you have it could have it
have a test for. I've had a wild,

1022
00:55:24,931 --> 00:55:29,730
a lot of wild cats. I had a, I had
feral cats in the past. Interesting.

1023
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:32,980
I'm going to have it. I've pretty
reckless. I'm pretty reckless, you know,

1024
00:55:32,981 --> 00:55:37,680
I feel stupid shit. I feel pretty angry.
I'm not angry as long as I work out,

1025
00:55:37,890 --> 00:55:41,910
but if I don't work out, supposedly,
if your immune system is strong,

1026
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:45,450
it keeps it in check and fights it off
pretty well. My immune system's not bad,

1027
00:55:45,630 --> 00:55:46,530
but I should get tested.

1028
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:50,010
They say a disproportionate amount of
motorcycle accident victims test positive

1029
00:55:50,011 --> 00:55:54,450
for toxo. Why? They don't know the
doctors are people are reckless.

1030
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:59,780
Yeah, maybe. I guess that's
weird to think about. Yeah.

1031
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:04,110
It's pretty ballsy riding around on
a motorcycle. Yeah. Especially in La.

1032
00:56:04,170 --> 00:56:08,970
I understand that a lot more in like
a Texas or in like an open area,

1033
00:56:08,971 --> 00:56:12,980
like they can never be too open.
I like, you know, there's just,

1034
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,930
cars are not looking for you.
If you want to learn more about this,

1035
00:56:15,931 --> 00:56:20,580
this is the number one expert is a guy
named Robert Sapolsky. And His name,

1036
00:56:20,581 --> 00:56:22,830
if you spell it,
s a p o.

1037
00:56:23,290 --> 00:56:27,280
O. L. S. K. Y. Just look up doctor.

1038
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:31,420
So Polski [inaudible] um, and then, uh,

1039
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:34,780
and look up toxo plasma and you'll,
you'll find it.

1040
00:56:34,781 --> 00:56:38,680
Just Google that and he's off every
word about it. Oh No, no, no, no, no.

1041
00:56:38,681 --> 00:56:41,500
It's way more connected to schizophrenia.

1042
00:56:41,501 --> 00:56:44,320
It's connected to a bunch of
different things. There's a, you know,

1043
00:56:44,350 --> 00:56:49,150
there's a lot of instances in the wild
of parasites changing the behavior of

1044
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:52,780
their hosts and causing their host
to even commit suicide. You know,

1045
00:56:52,781 --> 00:56:53,830
there's a lot of different things,

1046
00:56:53,831 --> 00:56:57,610
like there's a warm that we've talked
about before and aquatic worm that grows

1047
00:56:57,611 --> 00:57:01,300
inside of a grasshopper and then once
it reaches the point of gestation,

1048
00:57:01,450 --> 00:57:04,750
convinces the grasshopper to jump in
the water and the grasshopper drowns and

1049
00:57:04,751 --> 00:57:06,730
then escapes by crawling out of its body.

1050
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:09,730
It just breaks out of its
body like the alien chest.

1051
00:57:09,731 --> 00:57:12,640
Burster that's pretty sweet and it's
pretty dope when you think about it.

1052
00:57:13,050 --> 00:57:17,290
If nature is to devise some incredible
ways to keep moving on, you know,

1053
00:57:17,590 --> 00:57:19,620
and we are the most
incredible, you know, we,

1054
00:57:19,621 --> 00:57:23,080
we look to look at all these crazy
parasites like, wow, that's amazing man.

1055
00:57:23,081 --> 00:57:26,270
A worm grows in a grasshopper. Fuck
a worm and fucker. Grasshopper.

1056
00:57:26,290 --> 00:57:30,010
What about people you know,
were the weirdest thing to
nature's ever created? Man,

1057
00:57:30,011 --> 00:57:34,600
we can't even, we have to wear clothes.
We wear some shit that we invent.

1058
00:57:34,601 --> 00:57:37,110
We all do with what percentage
of the population, whereas

1059
00:57:37,230 --> 00:57:38,880
close,
just so you won't jump on me.

1060
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:46,930
Everybody take a shot.
If you want the Rogan drinking game,

1061
00:57:46,931 --> 00:57:51,760
the old Brian shot it's time. Oh
Brian. That's what he's there for.

1062
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:56,760
If you, if you weren't near
him and you saw her a lot,

1063
00:57:56,761 --> 00:57:59,700
your body all the time,
you would know.

1064
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:01,410
You wouldn't know where
those comments stem from.

1065
00:58:01,710 --> 00:58:05,010
I was glad you grew a beard because I,
your face used to be so kissable

1066
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:10,980
I couldn't, it doesn't look like
you're 36 yeah. When's your birthday?

1067
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:15,330
August 4th then you'd be Leo anymore,
but you should shut up. Yeah,

1068
00:58:15,331 --> 00:58:20,170
that shit all around. Didn't they
shift? You know, that's all bullshit.

1069
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:23,910
You just sort of a new gay, that was all
distinction. That was all bullshit. Yeah.

1070
00:58:23,911 --> 00:58:28,810
That, that the person that was saying all
that shit was bullshit. Supposedly the,

1071
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:33,060
this, this a straw with money in
astrology if stepped on that guy.

1072
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:37,410
But it's stuff funny. This astrology
thing is bullshit. This one's bullshit.

1073
00:58:37,411 --> 00:58:42,050
Those other ones are legit.
I don't believe in astrology.

1074
00:58:42,130 --> 00:58:47,130
I definitely believe in being born
and a certain time of the year if I,

1075
00:58:47,551 --> 00:58:49,200
if me and you were born in August,

1076
00:58:49,201 --> 00:58:54,201
I think that there's a lot of different
little things that are different than

1077
00:58:54,810 --> 00:58:57,510
say somebody who's born in November,
you know, just like little things,

1078
00:58:57,511 --> 00:58:58,410
like as an example,

1079
00:58:58,411 --> 00:59:02,550
when we were growing up our birthdays
that were never announced on this school

1080
00:59:02,551 --> 00:59:03,750
message system,
you know,

1081
00:59:03,751 --> 00:59:07,560
so we had that little bit of difference
and you can't let it go. Can, you know,

1082
00:59:11,370 --> 00:59:12,990
like little things like
that. That's what, that's,

1083
00:59:13,130 --> 00:59:15,130
that's Kinda what I believe there is.
I think

1084
00:59:15,130 --> 00:59:18,190
man, whenever something
is around for a long time,

1085
00:59:18,250 --> 00:59:21,830
I consider it whenever something's around,
whether it's religion, whether it's,

1086
00:59:21,831 --> 00:59:22,250
you know,

1087
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:25,760
whether it's some sort of a belief of
the cyclical nature of the universe.

1088
00:59:26,030 --> 00:59:27,250
You know,
an age is like you,

1089
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:29,410
you look into like the what
the Mayans believe in it.

1090
00:59:29,411 --> 00:59:32,000
And whenever you look into anything
that people believe for a long period of

1091
00:59:32,001 --> 00:59:35,400
time, we've got to go, hmm, where's
all this coming from? Where,

1092
00:59:35,430 --> 00:59:37,790
what does this astrology thing and
why did you all you people that were

1093
00:59:37,791 --> 00:59:41,180
struggling to find food to
eat and fighting off diseases,

1094
00:59:41,181 --> 00:59:42,530
why did you all agree on this?

1095
00:59:42,650 --> 00:59:45,890
Why did you all get together and decide
that there's 12 Zodiac symbols and each

1096
00:59:45,891 --> 00:59:49,040
one of them represents a very distinct
sort of personality and that, you know,

1097
00:59:49,070 --> 00:59:50,060
they can't,
you know,

1098
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:54,170
they can't like mingle with each other
and be happy because this one counteracts

1099
00:59:54,171 --> 00:59:56,990
that one. And I don't know, I
don't know if it's really, I'm not,

1100
00:59:56,991 --> 00:59:59,360
but I know that it gets
all those things started.

1101
00:59:59,370 --> 01:00:01,970
Like there's somebody that
everybody listens to maybe,

1102
01:00:01,971 --> 01:00:03,410
but it's super complicated.

1103
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:06,050
It's not like when you think
about like the shit that you get,

1104
01:00:06,051 --> 01:00:08,540
like when you go to the newspaper and
you look under Leo and you go, Oh,

1105
01:00:08,541 --> 01:00:10,950
that's not me, but that doesn't,
that's silly. That's silly.

1106
01:00:11,150 --> 01:00:12,680
But apparently if they could find out,
hey,

1107
01:00:12,681 --> 01:00:16,580
Brian Ryko was born at 3:00 AM and where
was he born? He was born in Columbus,

1108
01:00:16,581 --> 01:00:20,900
Ohio at 3:00 AM on August the fourth and
they can look at that and they can go,

1109
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:23,960
oh, okay. And we'll back then, whatever
the year, what, what year was that?

1110
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:28,690
74 1974 this was happening and this star
was here on this planet was here and

1111
01:00:28,710 --> 01:00:31,310
this, I think there's
gotta be something to that.

1112
01:00:31,550 --> 01:00:34,460
And it sounds hippy and sounds ridiculous,
but we,

1113
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:37,400
we know that the moon affects the tides.
We know that.

1114
01:00:37,401 --> 01:00:40,220
And we know that people are certain,
we thought it was 90% when you're correct,

1115
01:00:40,221 --> 01:00:43,040
and it's like 60% water.
So people are 60 something percent water.

1116
01:00:43,041 --> 01:00:46,220
We know that there's some sort of
an effect just based on gravity.

1117
01:00:46,221 --> 01:00:50,210
And we know that also planets must
affect us. The gravity of, you know, Star

1118
01:00:50,490 --> 01:00:54,090
when you were conceived, even, even going
back months to when you're conceived,

1119
01:00:54,110 --> 01:00:58,950
the depressure of when you came
into from sperm hitting the egg,

1120
01:00:59,070 --> 01:01:03,240
what was the bearer pressure? You know,
is it like know it was at a high pressure?

1121
01:01:03,241 --> 01:01:07,290
Maybe that changes though. Cause it's
such a small little thing anyways that,

1122
01:01:07,291 --> 01:01:09,990
you know, the, the littlest
thing could change,

1123
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:13,100
right? A lot of pressure. When you
were, I know there's a lot of friends,

1124
01:01:13,101 --> 01:01:16,640
were you in Colorado? Were you in
Florida? You know, where were you? Where,

1125
01:01:16,710 --> 01:01:19,340
where was it happening?
How racist are you going to be?

1126
01:01:20,990 --> 01:01:24,440
How much oxygen did you bring get
when you were born? Did you got wd 40?

1127
01:01:24,470 --> 01:01:26,990
Maybe that's one of the reason why
people in Colorado so cool. Maybe just,

1128
01:01:26,991 --> 01:01:31,110
just always just a little high because
it's so the altitude, it's really, um,

1129
01:01:32,310 --> 01:01:36,490
I gotta be careful whenever I go
there with booze. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1130
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:40,190
You've gotta be careful with booze. Booze
will knock you. Run Your Dick. If you,

1131
01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:41,810
I wish you would come to
see that fucking house.

1132
01:01:41,811 --> 01:01:44,150
And I had rented up in the mountain.
Man, when you get high up there,

1133
01:01:44,390 --> 01:01:48,860
Holy Shit at 8,300 feet above sea
level, when you get high, it's like,

1134
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:52,250
it's, it's a different sort of experience.
It's like, it's like eating pot,

1135
01:01:52,430 --> 01:01:54,800
you know when you smoke it, it's,
it'd be just like eating it.

1136
01:01:54,801 --> 01:01:59,260
It was just like blast right
into yourselves. Really
kind of crazy man, you know?

1137
01:01:59,270 --> 01:02:00,650
Cause there's not much oxygen up there.

1138
01:02:00,651 --> 01:02:04,160
So for whatever reason the marijuana
hits yarder booze hits your heart.

1139
01:02:04,490 --> 01:02:09,490
It's going to hit me really hard on
June 18th and how many works downtown or

1140
01:02:09,681 --> 01:02:11,870
Larimer Square?
Lammers squares.

1141
01:02:11,871 --> 01:02:16,000
Hard to find because the street's
not on the fucking navigation system.

1142
01:02:16,180 --> 01:02:20,340
That's a new one. Yeah. That's when I
realize how connected I am to electronics.

1143
01:02:20,580 --> 01:02:23,790
Like they gave me some directions over
the phone. Yeah. Turn right here. I'll go.

1144
01:02:23,791 --> 01:02:25,650
Okay. Okay, okay. Or tried to remember it,

1145
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:27,740
but then I just plugged
into my navigation system.

1146
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:29,790
Like what the fuck do
you mean it's not here?

1147
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,580
So I had to try to get
something reasonably close.

1148
01:02:32,670 --> 01:02:33,150
I hate that.

1149
01:02:33,150 --> 01:02:36,210
I hate the shit when it's just something
small to where it's like you didn't

1150
01:02:36,211 --> 01:02:39,690
choose Las Angeles and
Beverly Hills or you didn't do

1151
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:45,240
oh spell outdoors little peccadilloes
this little little differences like it's

1152
01:02:45,251 --> 01:02:46,084
amazing to me.

1153
01:02:46,090 --> 01:02:49,750
Like it's funny to me when you type
in something something.com and you

1154
01:02:49,751 --> 01:02:53,170
excellently hit a comma that they haven't
worked that out yet where we just go,

1155
01:02:53,171 --> 01:02:56,800
oh you meant to put a period there.
There's no reason to have a comma in a,

1156
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:01,840
in a URL. It doesn't even make sense.
But you just got to work that stuff out.

1157
01:03:02,140 --> 01:03:04,360
There's so many,
like I'm sure every time they,

1158
01:03:04,420 --> 01:03:07,670
you know like spell check on my
new iPhone is going to have, yeah.

1159
01:03:08,450 --> 01:03:12,620
What supposedly iPhone just hired
uh, one of the guys that, fuck,

1160
01:03:12,621 --> 01:03:14,870
I can't remember it to do their maps,
they're going to try to,

1161
01:03:14,871 --> 01:03:18,770
I think have a driving type
maps on the upcoming iPhone

1162
01:03:18,820 --> 01:03:21,510
is the new iPhone is going to be big.
Like the HCC,

1163
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:25,650
I don't believe it's going to be bigger
than the screen might go from corner to

1164
01:03:25,651 --> 01:03:27,870
corner. Like there'd be
less real state. You know,

1165
01:03:27,871 --> 01:03:29,160
like if you look at the iPhone now,

1166
01:03:29,310 --> 01:03:33,030
there's like a big chunk on the top and
bottom, you know that's not screen right.

1167
01:03:33,110 --> 01:03:34,980
I believe that probably
that will be stretched out,

1168
01:03:34,981 --> 01:03:37,200
but I don't think the phone's
going to be actually bigger.

1169
01:03:37,201 --> 01:03:40,020
I don't like those big huge droid
phones where it seems like there's,

1170
01:03:40,140 --> 01:03:42,120
there's the Tia 81
calculator in your pocket.

1171
01:03:42,180 --> 01:03:44,520
Okay. This is a little big, but God damn,

1172
01:03:44,521 --> 01:03:46,530
it's awesome when you're
scrolling through web pages,

1173
01:03:46,580 --> 01:03:48,570
your life's not awesome
at all. Triply. Yeah.

1174
01:03:48,571 --> 01:03:50,430
Triple who was complaining
about his battery life,

1175
01:03:50,431 --> 01:03:54,210
but he's got that HTC evo when
you're online with that thing,

1176
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:59,030
that is the shit first of all.
That four G is fucking dope. Yeah.

1177
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:00,540
God Damn.
It's awesome.

1178
01:04:00,690 --> 01:04:04,380
He was pulling up web pages like you're
at home on cable modems. It's amazing.

1179
01:04:04,381 --> 01:04:07,350
Like Bang, Bang photos.
Instantly everything.

1180
01:04:07,470 --> 01:04:11,730
They measured one of Verizon's new phones,
the thunderbolt or HTCs thunderbolt,

1181
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:13,340
the fucking,
they showed the,

1182
01:04:13,341 --> 01:04:16,740
on one of the online websites
where they analyze a cell phones,

1183
01:04:16,860 --> 01:04:20,790
they showed the download and upload speed.
It's like fucking cable modems.

1184
01:04:20,850 --> 01:04:25,590
It's insane for g is ridiculously fast
and you know what else is cool about

1185
01:04:25,591 --> 01:04:30,090
those droids? You can talk text messages.
You press a little thing and you go,

1186
01:04:30,091 --> 01:04:32,040
hey Doug,
I'm running 10 minutes late.

1187
01:04:32,250 --> 01:04:35,580
I'll call you when I get there
and it's really fucking accurate.

1188
01:04:35,730 --> 01:04:38,160
It's really good.
Like I did it with my friends.

1189
01:04:38,170 --> 01:04:42,120
The only thing he got wrong was my name.
Here's a few, said, hey, what's up?

1190
01:04:42,121 --> 01:04:45,600
This is Joe Rogan and I just want to say
I love you. It got everything like said.

1191
01:04:45,601 --> 01:04:47,400
It said Logan instead of Rogan.

1192
01:04:47,450 --> 01:04:48,650
There's tons of apps for that though,

1193
01:04:48,651 --> 01:04:52,160
for the iPhone and stuff like that for
tweets and stuff like that. Yeah, yeah.

1194
01:04:52,550 --> 01:04:54,350
They even have dragon on the iPhone,
but the

1195
01:04:54,630 --> 01:04:58,040
right, but does that go
straight into tweets? It's an
option when you, like if you,

1196
01:04:58,140 --> 01:05:00,510
if you go for tweets or text messages,
it's an option.

1197
01:05:00,690 --> 01:05:03,810
Like you know how like you look at
your thing and you can add a photo or

1198
01:05:03,811 --> 01:05:05,910
something like that. You can make
an an MMS, you know what I mean?

1199
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:09,270
With them it's like,
here's the video here.

1200
01:05:09,271 --> 01:05:11,730
You can add this and here
you can do it by voice.

1201
01:05:12,930 --> 01:05:17,470
Logan Rogan things going to be a great
like misunderstanding in some sort of

1202
01:05:17,471 --> 01:05:21,520
Romcom or something. They'll del
La, they'll take advantage of that.

1203
01:05:21,521 --> 01:05:23,890
It'd be like a story twist
that somebody who meant to,

1204
01:05:24,030 --> 01:05:27,880
you know meant to the voice message one
person and it will be a murder out wrong.

1205
01:05:27,881 --> 01:05:31,210
It would fuck Joe Logan and Joe
Logan Credit. He was like, fuck you.

1206
01:05:31,650 --> 01:05:34,120
And the guy's like, I don't even know
you. Oh yeah. Well I fucking know you.

1207
01:05:34,121 --> 01:05:36,250
I know where you live.
And then shit got crazy.

1208
01:05:36,540 --> 01:05:39,910
And really it was just because of me,
bro gains its worst.

1209
01:05:39,911 --> 01:05:41,710
That's the worst when you're
losing your hair especially.

1210
01:05:41,711 --> 01:05:45,250
And your name is Rogan and the stuff
that cures your hair is like Rogaine.

1211
01:05:45,710 --> 01:05:46,830
That's,
that's so rude.

1212
01:05:46,831 --> 01:05:49,150
That would have been really rough if you
were losing your hair when you were a

1213
01:05:49,151 --> 01:05:52,810
kid. I was with Amy, who's,
who's who is Joe Rogan.

1214
01:05:52,811 --> 01:05:56,140
I doubt many people would dare yelled
at at you. What are you talking about?

1215
01:05:56,141 --> 01:05:58,840
I hear that every day.
People yelling at you,

1216
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:05,500
they call you. Yeah. Oh yeah. I've
heard it a million times. Wow.

1217
01:06:06,220 --> 01:06:08,740
Andy Dick use it on Howard Stern,
the nerve of people.

1218
01:06:10,470 --> 01:06:13,780
I dodge that bullet when Andy
Dick fell off the wagon. I said,

1219
01:06:13,781 --> 01:06:16,090
he has to be sober for a year
before he can come over my house.

1220
01:06:16,510 --> 01:06:20,920
So when he got arrested I was like,
yeah, it's just bought myself some time.

1221
01:06:22,540 --> 01:06:26,620
Start the clock again another year.
Andy, as he can never draws them.

1222
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:31,840
I'm so Saba.
He's still welcome at the death squad.

1223
01:06:32,030 --> 01:06:34,840
Izzy is welcome at your house
and whether you like it or not,

1224
01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:38,170
he knows we live in a strategic move.

1225
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:41,560
I ran into him on the streets a couple
of weeks ago at the Bridgetown comedy

1226
01:06:41,561 --> 01:06:44,580
festival and it was, you
know, 6:00 PM or something.

1227
01:06:44,610 --> 01:06:47,980
He was just gone and just being a
complete asshole. I was just like,

1228
01:06:48,610 --> 01:06:53,440
Margaret Cho was dragging him around is
so crazy. It was. I didn't know that.

1229
01:06:53,441 --> 01:06:56,980
He's talked to a ton of shit about
me on I'm mark Marin's podcast.

1230
01:06:57,160 --> 01:06:58,030
We're just talking about me.

1231
01:06:58,031 --> 01:07:02,850
When we were younger on Newsradio about
what an asshole I was to him. I said,

1232
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:05,140
no idea and that, and then, you know,

1233
01:07:05,141 --> 01:07:08,400
he came on the podcast and you barely see
he was, he was, he was intimating that,

1234
01:07:08,401 --> 01:07:10,360
you know, I was mean to him when
he was young, but I'm like, dude,

1235
01:07:10,361 --> 01:07:13,270
he used to pull your dick out.
He used to show up fucked up.

1236
01:07:13,380 --> 01:07:15,580
Couldn't probably just always hate it.
Look on your face like,

1237
01:07:15,581 --> 01:07:18,600
what the fuck are you doing? It was
hard work. That's translates into you.

1238
01:07:18,610 --> 01:07:22,540
He's a meaning you to see it as a stand
around and laugh at all my antics.

1239
01:07:22,570 --> 01:07:27,550
But on Marin's podcast, God, he like had,
it's so twisted. It was so ridiculous.

1240
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:30,190
I don't, that's, I don't think he
should be a witness for anything.

1241
01:07:30,730 --> 01:07:33,700
I don't think you should ever get to say,
well, here's what I thought happened.

1242
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:38,290
Are you kidding? I want him writing my
autobiography. This is what I remember.

1243
01:07:38,410 --> 01:07:42,840
You're hangry. You so angry
at me. He, I was, uh, in my,

1244
01:07:42,940 --> 01:07:44,730
in my trailer with my girlfriend and I go,

1245
01:07:45,330 --> 01:07:48,640
what do you Jang janking
they're aging and they're like,

1246
01:07:48,641 --> 01:07:51,850
I'm getting dressed Andy up and up to
when I talk to you. So open up the door.

1247
01:07:51,851 --> 01:07:54,160
He's got his dick in his hand.
It's not even hard. And he's like,

1248
01:07:54,161 --> 01:07:56,950
kind of like pull on us. Are you mad
that it's not hard or would you rather

1249
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:03,940
have some respect? You know, don't be so,

1250
01:08:04,060 --> 01:08:07,030
so brave that you could pull your
dick out. It's not even hard yet.

1251
01:08:07,060 --> 01:08:09,640
It's just assuming you're
such a bad mother fucker.

1252
01:08:09,641 --> 01:08:13,200
You can keep this party going, but that's
what she does do right? Don't flashers.

1253
01:08:13,210 --> 01:08:15,590
Just show their flacid Dick.
Do they?

1254
01:08:15,650 --> 01:08:18,010
I don't think they work one up
and then open their trench coat.

1255
01:08:18,030 --> 01:08:19,590
There's no such thing as flashers anymore.

1256
01:08:19,610 --> 01:08:23,050
Did you know that you're all wet
shoes, bro? This plenty of flashes.

1257
01:08:23,270 --> 01:08:24,590
I would you talking about Brian?

1258
01:08:24,591 --> 01:08:28,820
I know a bunch of girls who've had guys
whipped your dick. Yes, I know a bunch.

1259
01:08:28,821 --> 01:08:31,550
I think about doing it all the time.
Comics,

1260
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:37,200
one day I might pull the trigger.
I might go through with this check off.

1261
01:08:37,220 --> 01:08:42,110
Doug, did you ever have them on
your show? Who, Andy? Yeah, he did,

1262
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:46,640
uh, just with, we didn't tape
it for anything, but he did
show up on one of my, uh,

1263
01:08:46,790 --> 01:08:51,380
interruption shows and it just became
like kind of a serious conversation about,

1264
01:08:51,860 --> 01:08:54,980
you know, what he was going through
at that time. You know, he had the,

1265
01:08:55,070 --> 01:08:59,450
he had the thing on his ankle and, you
know, part of things trying guy like Andy.

1266
01:08:59,660 --> 01:09:03,860
Andy's a very funny man. He's one of
the funniest guys I've ever worked with.

1267
01:09:03,890 --> 01:09:06,740
One of the most talented,
like comedic actors I ever worked with.

1268
01:09:06,741 --> 01:09:09,950
And I really do love the Guy I, even
though I don't want them over my house,

1269
01:09:09,951 --> 01:09:11,810
I really do love,
he's an incredibly gifted,

1270
01:09:11,811 --> 01:09:16,550
but in a way it's almost like he's so
gifted from such an early age that like

1271
01:09:16,551 --> 01:09:20,240
that can kind of turn somebody into
a Weirdo that they, you know, they,

1272
01:09:20,270 --> 01:09:23,180
they can't really relate to people
in an irregular way because there,

1273
01:09:23,470 --> 01:09:25,700
I think he had, I told
him, I don't think it's,

1274
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:30,770
that's it at all knowing Andy hit fucking
horrendous childhood. It was beyond,

1275
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:33,800
he can't even remember it,
but it was probably so freeing to run it,

1276
01:09:33,801 --> 01:09:38,180
to end up with a, you know, Ben Stiller
and that whole crowd and to be, and to be,

1277
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:39,073
you know,

1278
01:09:39,140 --> 01:09:42,790
like how old was he when the Ben Stiller
show was on early twenties right? Yeah.

1279
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:45,350
He must have been, cause he's
pretty young. It's a couple
of years older than me.

1280
01:09:45,351 --> 01:09:46,700
I think he's 45 talent.

1281
01:09:46,701 --> 01:09:50,650
He had the kind of talent that Dan Akroyd
had in the first few seasons of a SNL

1282
01:09:50,660 --> 01:09:53,600
where he was 20 but he could
play a 50 year old and a sketch.

1283
01:09:53,601 --> 01:09:57,790
And you don't even question. It was Dan
Akroyd 20 he was super young when the,

1284
01:09:57,791 --> 01:10:02,240
the first season of SNL, he must've been
2120 something like that. Dan Akroyd,

1285
01:10:02,290 --> 01:10:07,290
he's [inaudible] man because he's a guy
that went from the blues brothers to

1286
01:10:07,641 --> 01:10:12,260
some of those fucking movies that he
did were just like, what happened? Did,

1287
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:16,310
did this, you have no control over this
or did you actually think this was funny?

1288
01:10:16,311 --> 01:10:19,050
I need to know. I need to know
if you'd liked Caddyshack two.

1289
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:22,290
I need to know there's a lot of three
or whatever the fuck it was. Yeah,

1290
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:26,000
it was two sergeant Bilko, you know, or
any of that crap at either. But you know,

1291
01:10:26,150 --> 01:10:30,290
that's the thing is you take
a Steve Martin, you know,
he does some dumb, you know,

1292
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:31,730
bringing down the house kind of stuff.

1293
01:10:31,731 --> 01:10:35,810
But he also is writing books
and playing his Banjo and he's,

1294
01:10:35,990 --> 01:10:40,550
he's clearly, you know, still a very
talented, if not completely with it,

1295
01:10:40,580 --> 01:10:42,100
but somebody like Dan Akroyd,
you just,

1296
01:10:42,110 --> 01:10:45,310
you just wonder how did
that talent gets squandered.

1297
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:48,860
Cause he was also great at playing
characters and then he sort of like just

1298
01:10:48,861 --> 01:10:52,460
became the Dan Akroyd character and
everything, which was just kind of like a,

1299
01:10:53,150 --> 01:10:56,840
you know, goofy pump is fat guy or
whatever. I blamed the House of Blues.

1300
01:10:57,170 --> 01:11:00,260
Well that's uh, that's the best thing
he's ever done that in the blues brothers.

1301
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:05,380
Um, but yeah, he's a, he's a
crazy UFO head to yeah. Yeah.

1302
01:11:05,381 --> 01:11:09,560
He's super into that stuff.
He's a believer, you know,
a real believer. You know,

1303
01:11:09,561 --> 01:11:12,930
Colin had coneheads movies. Not that
bad. No, it's not that bad. Yeah.

1304
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:16,470
Bad is you take like, you think, oh, that
must have been really weak. But it was,

1305
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:19,590
it was actually pretty good. No,
that was decent. It was decent.

1306
01:11:19,830 --> 01:11:22,860
But like the blues brothers, like one
of the greatest of all time. Yeah.

1307
01:11:22,870 --> 01:11:24,060
I'm to see that again soon.

1308
01:11:24,061 --> 01:11:27,840
There's going to be a double bill at
the new Beverly of that and I'm raising

1309
01:11:27,841 --> 01:11:32,520
Arizona. Ah, when is this? That's
a Friday night. This Friday night.

1310
01:11:32,910 --> 01:11:35,700
Ladies and gentlemen, if you want to
party with Doug Benson and Los Angeles,

1311
01:11:35,701 --> 01:11:38,400
where's it at? It's the new
Beverly. The new Beverly,

1312
01:11:38,401 --> 01:11:43,080
you should get stuck at seven 30 to nine
30. You should fucking organize mass.

1313
01:11:43,110 --> 01:11:46,860
Like Oh, screenings like
organize, say hey everybody,

1314
01:11:47,010 --> 01:11:49,850
let's go Friday, April 20, whatever.

1315
01:11:50,490 --> 01:11:55,470
It's funny movie theaters just for his
fans and packs it. Who Does Mc? Chris,

1316
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:57,840
how much does it cost to rent out a
whole movie theater? I don't know.

1317
01:11:57,841 --> 01:11:59,710
But they do it all the time. So
a lot of money man. Yeah, no,

1318
01:11:59,730 --> 01:12:02,990
but I don't need to like $20 seats.
How much does the seat? Well No,

1319
01:12:03,030 --> 01:12:05,820
they have deals for renting out a
whole theaters. Really? Yeah. For like,

1320
01:12:06,150 --> 01:12:08,040
you know when,
when we used to work at a movie theater,

1321
01:12:08,041 --> 01:12:11,640
they used to print them out for like
businesses to show like videos and stuff

1322
01:12:11,641 --> 01:12:14,640
like that. I've seen that. Yeah.
I've seen those ads they have,

1323
01:12:14,641 --> 01:12:17,460
if you get to the movies too
early before the previews start,

1324
01:12:17,461 --> 01:12:20,820
they have like the previous to the
previews and those like show like,

1325
01:12:20,850 --> 01:12:24,180
like how you can use it for like
conferences and stuff like that. Yeah,

1326
01:12:24,181 --> 01:12:28,230
they got a lot of, uh, a
lot of extra business there.
They always have those, um,

1327
01:12:28,380 --> 01:12:31,860
like, you know, come to the theater
to watch a live streaming of an opera

1328
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:37,800
fc. Yeah, we've done a couple of UFC.
UFC does it. What's his name? Did it?

1329
01:12:37,801 --> 01:12:40,260
The Fox News Guy.
A Glenn Beck.

1330
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:45,100
He'd do his concerts that way. I
want to talk to him so bad. Huh?

1331
01:12:45,450 --> 01:12:49,110
He's one of my all time. All
time. Need to talk to guys.

1332
01:12:49,111 --> 01:12:51,900
I would love to talk to him
like in a format like this,

1333
01:12:52,230 --> 01:12:55,830
like one of the beautiful things about
the podcast is not just that the podcast

1334
01:12:55,831 --> 01:13:00,600
is on iTunes available for free,
but that it's Ustream and it's live.

1335
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:04,710
This is live. This is you. This is
the real Doug Benson. This is no,

1336
01:13:04,711 --> 01:13:07,860
but there's no editing. Should really
do some vaporizer hits then. Yeah.

1337
01:13:07,890 --> 01:13:11,880
If it's just a real duck show how real.
We talked about some parties,

1338
01:13:11,881 --> 01:13:14,730
ladies and gentlemen, the crackling
you hear is plastic right now.

1339
01:13:14,731 --> 01:13:17,790
Doctor drew is rolling in his lab coat.

1340
01:13:17,820 --> 01:13:21,480
I ran into Dr drew at that
April foolishness thing and
he was with his kids and

1341
01:13:21,481 --> 01:13:25,140
I think their fans. Oh,
that's hilarious. Shit.

1342
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:29,190
That's hilarious. You need to find out.
You should have asked a very bluntly,

1343
01:13:29,191 --> 01:13:32,430
I'm sorry you fans of mine, I don't
mean to be rude. Do you know who I am?

1344
01:13:32,460 --> 01:13:35,730
They seem like they were
pretty receptive to be there.

1345
01:13:35,731 --> 01:13:38,010
And then they saw my set
and I at that show I just,

1346
01:13:38,011 --> 01:13:40,070
it was wall to wall pot and uh,

1347
01:13:40,170 --> 01:13:42,360
Kevin and being said they'd
never seen and you know,

1348
01:13:42,361 --> 01:13:45,240
they've been around a lot of musicians
and they said they'd never seen anybody

1349
01:13:45,241 --> 01:13:46,350
as high as I was at night.

1350
01:13:48,220 --> 01:13:52,590
You were so fucking high in Toronto
and when you came in Toronto we were a,

1351
01:13:52,591 --> 01:13:55,440
Doug did a last minute guest that you
were just like go out there and do

1352
01:13:55,441 --> 01:13:59,820
something. So I guess bike 10
minutes of the, the, the album,

1353
01:13:59,821 --> 01:14:00,900
I just record it.
I couldn't,

1354
01:14:00,930 --> 01:14:05,190
I couldn't begin to come up with any new
stuff that you were too big or riff too

1355
01:14:05,191 --> 01:14:07,420
much. I, I'm sure I
riffed quite a bit, but I,

1356
01:14:07,540 --> 01:14:09,750
I kind of stuck to a plan when
I got out there. I didn't,

1357
01:14:09,751 --> 01:14:12,040
I didn't go out there and thinking
like, oh, I'll just go out and

1358
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:14,230
see whatever happens. You
know, there's too many people.

1359
01:14:14,231 --> 01:14:16,920
How was I going to do this
bit and this bit, you know,

1360
01:14:16,930 --> 01:14:20,020
I wrote it all down right before I went
to hell. Did you really? Yeah. Yeah.

1361
01:14:20,110 --> 01:14:22,280
Do you ride a lot?
I mean he's here every day.

1362
01:14:22,660 --> 01:14:26,080
Something you do a week on a terrible,
I never sit down to write. I just,

1363
01:14:26,350 --> 01:14:29,810
when I think now, especially with
Twitter, if I think of a joke favor,

1364
01:14:29,811 --> 01:14:31,840
it's relatively quick.
I just throw it on Twitter.

1365
01:14:31,841 --> 01:14:36,160
And if it's more of like a a story
or a, you know, a longer bit,

1366
01:14:36,161 --> 01:14:38,260
then I'll just try it the next
time I do a show, you know,

1367
01:14:38,261 --> 01:14:42,520
like a lot of my shows now I just start
off with, hey, so here's what I did today.

1368
01:14:42,521 --> 01:14:44,890
You know, I just sort of talk
about whatever. And then,

1369
01:14:44,891 --> 01:14:48,970
cause then you always know you got the
jokes ready to go when it's time and that

1370
01:14:48,971 --> 01:14:52,480
you'll be able to finish strong.
But it's fun to just be able to,

1371
01:14:53,020 --> 01:14:55,420
I know I write a lot. I
write a lot of long. Yeah,

1372
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:59,500
you're really intense in that
way and it's a, it's amazing,

1373
01:14:59,501 --> 01:15:02,210
especially considering what you're about
to do right now. That's, it's ready.

1374
01:15:03,970 --> 01:15:07,930
Jiffy pop is ready. I wonder if it's
possible for the bag to explode.

1375
01:15:07,931 --> 01:15:11,620
I've never had that out and it was
never happened. Slowly. Slowly leaks.

1376
01:15:11,710 --> 01:15:14,170
You know what, sue sisters, your idea.
So I want you to take the throne.

1377
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:17,460
Fair enough. I think the hardest
part for me is fine. I like,

1378
01:15:17,470 --> 01:15:20,890
I'll think of it like a one bit like a
tweet joke that I want to make it into a

1379
01:15:20,891 --> 01:15:24,040
whole joke, joke, joke, and
it's hard to take, you know,

1380
01:15:24,041 --> 01:15:26,350
just a small little idea
and make it a big joke.

1381
01:15:26,620 --> 01:15:29,620
Like I have this thing that happened
actually happened to me the other day.

1382
01:15:29,620 --> 01:15:32,500
I think it's Hilarious,
but I need to build off of it.

1383
01:15:32,501 --> 01:15:36,530
I can just say that and be
like, ha ha, that's it. You
know? Well, you know what man,

1384
01:15:37,210 --> 01:15:41,440
the war of art is a brilliant
book by Dr Steven Pressfield.

1385
01:15:42,190 --> 01:15:46,380
Dr Steven Pressfield, I just give them
a doctorate. Hunter, ricks Thompson.

1386
01:15:46,381 --> 01:15:49,420
We go in the right way. We're not
going anywhere, bro. It's all good.

1387
01:15:49,421 --> 01:15:52,210
We've got plenty of weed. You know what
I'm saying? When people always get like,

1388
01:15:52,211 --> 01:15:57,100
no, it's this way. No of
the biggest hassles are man,

1389
01:15:57,340 --> 01:16:02,170
the guy who was holding the joint and
wants to start his fucking story. Oh yeah.

1390
01:16:02,230 --> 01:16:04,860
Oh my God,
that's the worst.

1391
01:16:05,230 --> 01:16:10,230
Or your dog eats or all your
weed or your dog's got an excuse.

1392
01:16:10,331 --> 01:16:14,710
He's a fucking dog. The Guy, the
guy who holds the joint is go,

1393
01:16:14,890 --> 01:16:17,050
Oh man, you wouldn't
believe this man. Right?

1394
01:16:17,110 --> 01:16:21,100
So he's got his joint joint in his hand.
There's a circle like 10 people.

1395
01:16:21,101 --> 01:16:23,830
He's like, so I owe the
student loan, right?

1396
01:16:24,610 --> 01:16:29,230
I just supposed to take care of it and
like my uncle was supposed to and and

1397
01:16:29,231 --> 01:16:30,430
you're like Japan,
that joint,

1398
01:16:30,431 --> 01:16:34,900
you fucking jump in right away when I
see that comment because he's holding you

1399
01:16:34,901 --> 01:16:36,310
hostage holding on to anymore.

1400
01:16:36,580 --> 01:16:39,490
And that's a great thing about what I
love about smoking circle is everyone can

1401
01:16:39,491 --> 01:16:42,550
just chat the whole time. You could
be getting high having conversations.

1402
01:16:43,060 --> 01:16:46,420
Then it's the only time where you go lip
to lip on something and another man has

1403
01:16:46,421 --> 01:16:49,810
it. You don't even flinch. Yeah. Yeah.
Your immune system must be awesome.

1404
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:54,470
Or are you just have the best aids?

1405
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:58,720
All these aides are fighting it out for
battle inside your body. You get tested.

1406
01:16:59,380 --> 01:17:03,400
Every aids ever. I had a really good
winter and I didn't even get my,

1407
01:17:03,401 --> 01:17:06,580
I usually get a flu shot of
all three types of toxo inside.

1408
01:17:06,581 --> 01:17:09,380
You didn't get around to my flu shot
and I didn't and I didn't get sick much

1409
01:17:09,381 --> 01:17:09,980
though.
The whole

1410
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:14,600
winter I lucked out. But yeah.
You know what man, this was a,

1411
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:17,860
I had one cold this winter and
it was quick as fuck and I,

1412
01:17:17,861 --> 01:17:22,160
I believe it was some sort of a flu and
it was really quick. I go, you know,

1413
01:17:22,161 --> 01:17:26,150
I'm like 24 hours sweating and shitting.
As soon as something comes on, you know,

1414
01:17:26,151 --> 01:17:29,570
like I just like him just
in the sauna or you know,

1415
01:17:29,571 --> 01:17:33,110
or on the floor drinking a lot of fluids.

1416
01:17:33,170 --> 01:17:35,810
So you'd believe in sweating and
everything on the toilet. I just, yeah,

1417
01:17:35,811 --> 01:17:37,880
just get it.
Same thing with a really bad hangover.

1418
01:17:37,881 --> 01:17:39,260
I just want to like get rid of it.

1419
01:17:39,261 --> 01:17:43,010
Like I love being hung over like in a
nice hotel in Vegas because they always

1420
01:17:43,011 --> 01:17:46,420
have, uh, you know, full blown
steam room. You should go,

1421
01:17:47,210 --> 01:17:49,340
you should be careful when
you're sick about working out.

1422
01:17:49,580 --> 01:17:52,100
A lot of people used to think that work,
he would sweat it out of you,

1423
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:55,890
but that's not real. And you, when
you, if you have a real workout,

1424
01:17:55,891 --> 01:17:59,900
it's one thing is like just gently moving
and slowly kind of breaking a sweat

1425
01:18:00,050 --> 01:18:01,580
that's just kind of getting
your circulation going.

1426
01:18:01,581 --> 01:18:02,960
But whenever you stress yourself,

1427
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:05,750
like if you like breathing heavy
and you're like really pushing,

1428
01:18:05,930 --> 01:18:10,260
you weaken your immune system, super
dehydrated on top of all that. Yes. Yeah,

1429
01:18:10,350 --> 01:18:14,240
we usually are. When you have a hangover,
is it crazy? Yeah. You gotta be careful.

1430
01:18:14,241 --> 01:18:16,760
I drink a ton of water, that's
for sure. That's the huge one.

1431
01:18:16,910 --> 01:18:19,800
The water is the most important thing and
you kind of take fucking vitamins, man.

1432
01:18:19,801 --> 01:18:23,210
And most likely you're not getting what
you really need from your food unless

1433
01:18:23,211 --> 01:18:26,500
you have a super clean diet. You
need some vitamins. I'm putting out,

1434
01:18:26,501 --> 01:18:28,940
I'm with Chris from on it.
Chris Marcus,

1435
01:18:29,060 --> 01:18:32,570
we're going to put out this
neuro a formula. Nootropics.
Have you been taking it?

1436
01:18:32,580 --> 01:18:35,360
Dude, I've been taken, dude. I've been
taking it do if you've been taking it.

1437
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:38,030
You know what I noticed right away where
the first day I had a really hard time

1438
01:18:38,031 --> 01:18:38,980
sleeping.
Yeah.

1439
01:18:39,020 --> 01:18:44,020
I was lying in bed and my brain was flying
and my dreams were super vivid and he

1440
01:18:44,091 --> 01:18:47,000
told me not to take it before I went
to bed. He told me to take it uh,

1441
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:49,070
earlier and I took it to
like two in the afternoon,

1442
01:18:49,190 --> 01:18:52,720
but I was still jazz that in my mind
and one in one in the morning. Yeah.

1443
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:56,600
Have you noticed that? I,
yeah, I've been staying up.

1444
01:18:56,720 --> 01:18:59,350
I'm always staying up like that.
So yeah, you're like, well,

1445
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:03,330
you have this crazy tweeting in the
middle of this really loose schedule that

1446
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:04,940
most people would really kill for.

1447
01:19:05,900 --> 01:19:08,780
Most people hear about you
on Twitter just like, God.

1448
01:19:09,170 --> 01:19:11,090
So loves to just be able to sleep.

1449
01:19:11,450 --> 01:19:14,360
Everybody that calls me in the morning or
rights to me in the morning, it's like,

1450
01:19:14,361 --> 01:19:17,990
sorry I know you, you know you're
probably not up. And I'm just like,

1451
01:19:17,991 --> 01:19:20,870
well you don't really
know me then because I um,

1452
01:19:21,290 --> 01:19:24,320
I get up early all the time
because you got to catch a flight,

1453
01:19:24,321 --> 01:19:28,670
you got to do vulner getting to
do an interview, you get whatever.

1454
01:19:28,671 --> 01:19:30,620
Like I have to get up early
so often they're like,

1455
01:19:30,621 --> 01:19:32,750
I've totally become a morning person.
You know,

1456
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:35,660
I have a hard time doing interviews
in the morning. My brain just don't,

1457
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:36,950
doesn't fire that good.

1458
01:19:36,980 --> 01:19:40,610
Like when I get up and I go somewhere
and then like you get in the car and then

1459
01:19:40,611 --> 01:19:42,800
you get to the radio station,
then I'm woken up.

1460
01:19:43,100 --> 01:19:46,460
But like when I just wake up and then
like the first words that I say are on the

1461
01:19:46,461 --> 01:19:49,970
air, you have to get on the phone right
away. Oh God. I feel like such a retard.

1462
01:19:50,180 --> 01:19:55,070
I like struggle to talk, you know,
but that works for me. So, you know,

1463
01:19:55,071 --> 01:19:56,720
like they,
they,

1464
01:19:56,721 --> 01:20:00,770
it gets laughs if I'm having trouble
trouble expressing myself, you know,

1465
01:20:00,771 --> 01:20:03,530
and they, cause that's the morning
radios. The worst there was like,

1466
01:20:03,580 --> 01:20:08,010
oh stoner I had to get up at 7:55
AM to talk to us and it's just like

1467
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:12,990
went for a while preparing for all
these crazy sound effects. Yeah.

1468
01:20:12,991 --> 01:20:16,860
That's the only thing that bugs me about
Adam Carolla's podcast. Adam, I love you.

1469
01:20:17,250 --> 01:20:19,920
Stop. So I actually listened
to it with those fucking size.

1470
01:20:20,790 --> 01:20:24,630
I said listen to it the other day cause
I asked Adam Carolla's podcast cause I

1471
01:20:24,631 --> 01:20:25,290
haven't really,

1472
01:20:25,290 --> 01:20:27,900
I just don't have time to listen to
other people's podcasts right now.

1473
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:31,860
But I listened to it and uh, he
uh, it was so retarded though.

1474
01:20:31,861 --> 01:20:35,430
Sound effects were really bad
times. They make me laugh. Yeah.

1475
01:20:35,770 --> 01:20:38,010
It's like in the middle of like Adam
is talking and then middle of it,

1476
01:20:38,011 --> 01:20:41,960
then they have like a quote from a movie
that didn't like, it was like what did,

1477
01:20:42,380 --> 01:20:45,360
sometimes that is in the middle. It's
definitely an art form. You know,

1478
01:20:45,361 --> 01:20:46,194
it's hard to just,

1479
01:20:46,730 --> 01:20:47,870
you know,
to have this whole,

1480
01:20:47,871 --> 01:20:51,470
all these sound effects loaded in and
pick one really fast. It's appropriate.

1481
01:20:51,471 --> 01:20:52,980
But when they nail it,
like I think they,

1482
01:20:52,981 --> 01:20:56,690
they're pretty funny out with Howard
Stern sometimes too. He, they're pretty,

1483
01:20:57,380 --> 01:21:00,860
they don't do them a lot, but they
do them. Yeah. When they do them,

1484
01:21:00,861 --> 01:21:04,040
it makes me laugh sometimes
just cause it's so oftentimes,

1485
01:21:04,041 --> 01:21:06,700
it's just so odd to suddenly hear
like, will Farrell, you know,

1486
01:21:06,710 --> 01:21:10,130
these welfare all loud on a Corolla
and him just yelling random things.

1487
01:21:10,131 --> 01:21:10,964
It's pretty funny.

1488
01:21:11,060 --> 01:21:13,850
You know what they have in house or in
this morning I was listening to my car,

1489
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:18,560
they had a fake Arnold and it talking
about the, uh, the divorce. Oh yeah.

1490
01:21:18,650 --> 01:21:22,940
Oh my God. It was fucking good. It was
so good. It was so good that I thought,

1491
01:21:22,941 --> 01:21:26,990
Holy Shit, Arnold Schwarzenegger is going
off. Like maybe I thought it was real.

1492
01:21:27,020 --> 01:21:29,600
I really thought it was real.
It took me like 15 seconds.

1493
01:21:30,020 --> 01:21:33,920
Then I take her whole dresses and like
throw them on the bed and I shit all over

1494
01:21:33,921 --> 01:21:36,740
them. That's what I was like, okay.
He wouldn't say that. You know,

1495
01:21:36,750 --> 01:21:40,320
it was like only me and my underwear.
I get the stories I can't do.

1496
01:21:40,340 --> 01:21:44,340
My lead guy calls him, they call him
fake card on whatever your dresses and

1497
01:21:45,870 --> 01:21:49,820
um, yeah. He called him afterwards.
He called them fake Arnold.

1498
01:21:49,910 --> 01:21:53,990
So while it was going on, man, it's
like the fake David Letterman got, damn,

1499
01:21:53,991 --> 01:21:56,630
that guy's good. That holy
Shit. That guy's good.

1500
01:21:57,020 --> 01:22:00,760
This fake Arnold is just as good man.
He's fucking dead on. He's dead on.

1501
01:22:00,770 --> 01:22:02,870
It's perfect. He's the fucking, you know,

1502
01:22:02,871 --> 01:22:05,690
they asked him if he's ever going to get
married again. Fuck you. Never again.

1503
01:22:07,970 --> 01:22:10,910
Arnold's getting divorced. He's
like almost dead. It's almost dead.

1504
01:22:10,911 --> 01:22:11,744
He's getting divorced.

1505
01:22:11,780 --> 01:22:15,470
There's something much more sad about
an old dude that gets divorced if like

1506
01:22:15,471 --> 01:22:18,590
Ryan Reynolds got divorced and he like,
who could blame the kid?

1507
01:22:18,591 --> 01:22:20,660
He's got perfect bone structure.
You're hung in there.

1508
01:22:20,661 --> 01:22:24,230
As long as he could go get
that pussy, go get it, Ryan.

1509
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:28,520
You know what the fuck the guys probably
got a million chicks clawing at them 24

1510
01:22:28,521 --> 01:22:32,120
hours a day everywhere he goes. Just
trying to peek at his abs, you know,

1511
01:22:32,121 --> 01:22:33,380
God bless him for hanging in there.

1512
01:22:33,381 --> 01:22:35,720
Even when scarlet Johannson for a
year and a half. You know what I mean?

1513
01:22:36,110 --> 01:22:39,410
You can't fault him. But when you hear
Arnold and Arnold getting divorced now,

1514
01:22:39,450 --> 01:22:43,070
he still has checks after no nothing,
nothing.

1515
01:22:43,071 --> 01:22:47,390
Just as squats and and beets and extra.

1516
01:22:48,020 --> 01:22:50,540
It does become about the
thing different from him.

1517
01:22:50,541 --> 01:22:54,350
Like I'm sure he'll get like a lot of
pretty girls that just want attention from

1518
01:22:54,351 --> 01:22:57,560
him and Nardo and the last thing they'd
want to do is he'll get stingily sleep

1519
01:22:57,561 --> 01:22:59,450
with them.
Broken bitches.

1520
01:22:59,480 --> 01:23:03,590
He's going to get some girls who
want to have some sort of a slice of,

1521
01:23:03,710 --> 01:23:06,160
he's going to get the kind
of chicks Gary Coleman

1522
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:10,090
was getting. No, you're going to give me
the way Gary Coleman, we're getting chicks

1523
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:17,040
Coleman and his whole act was to, Jasper
had borrowed still a bad bar is still,

1524
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:21,190
you know, he'll get some times
he very quietly made wiggle,

1525
01:23:21,670 --> 01:23:25,510
wiggle ISED we will. Why legalized
it? I'm not hating on him. I love him.

1526
01:23:25,511 --> 01:23:26,530
I'm just saying, I mean, dude,

1527
01:23:26,531 --> 01:23:30,430
Conan the barbarian was one of my all
time fucking favorite movies and the would

1528
01:23:30,431 --> 01:23:31,420
not have been the same.

1529
01:23:31,510 --> 01:23:34,780
They've got a new Conan coming
out and the dude looks normal,

1530
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:39,760
maybe very charming about most
sports nigger movies because he,

1531
01:23:39,761 --> 01:23:44,670
so he just didn't try to, you know,
get an American accent, you know,

1532
01:23:44,890 --> 01:23:49,690
he just is who he is, what his name is.
He is like kindergarten cop is hilarious.

1533
01:23:50,010 --> 01:23:53,770
His name is Swardson nigger.
You know what I mean?

1534
01:23:53,771 --> 01:23:58,771
He's an all time great movie star and
his name is just for the most people

1535
01:23:58,901 --> 01:24:02,830
totally on on PR spillable who
the fuck knows how to spell that?

1536
01:24:02,890 --> 01:24:07,840
S. C. H. W. A. R. C. E.
This new guy, g. E. R.

1537
01:24:07,930 --> 01:24:12,040
This new guy's probably closer to what
Conan really would look like if it was a

1538
01:24:12,041 --> 01:24:14,320
guy who was the a sward
around in real life.

1539
01:24:14,470 --> 01:24:16,270
He wouldn't be built like
Arnold Schwarzenegger.

1540
01:24:16,271 --> 01:24:20,050
He would be built like an athlete who
may want to see Thor. I taught already.

1541
01:24:20,051 --> 01:24:22,480
It's awesome. You loved it.
Fuck yeah, it was great.

1542
01:24:22,780 --> 01:24:25,660
I have trouble with all the stuff in
the home planet and I just couldn't,

1543
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:29,490
I couldn't let go and just enjoy it.
I just want,

1544
01:24:29,491 --> 01:24:32,980
I just wanted to see him get his hammer
and started fighting with people on

1545
01:24:32,981 --> 01:24:35,080
earth and wasn't it funny when the guy,

1546
01:24:35,730 --> 01:24:38,680
when the guy from the government was like,
uh,

1547
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:41,110
when they see that when you
see the big robot, he's like,

1548
01:24:41,111 --> 01:24:44,590
is that one of Tony Stark's robots?
Which is a cute line.

1549
01:24:44,980 --> 01:24:48,200
Why isn't the next thing he does is get
on his cell phone and get one of Tony

1550
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:51,340
Stark's to robots to come take care
of this giant robot that's clearly,

1551
01:24:51,400 --> 01:24:55,090
clearly means to hurt people. Yeah.
They bring him in. Yeah. What the fuck?

1552
01:24:55,091 --> 01:24:56,590
Where's iron man when you need them?
Yeah.

1553
01:24:56,860 --> 01:24:59,800
Cause hell if that's what this is is
it's just another setting up an Avengers

1554
01:24:59,801 --> 01:25:02,980
movie where they're all going to
be in it, but it's, it's, you know,

1555
01:25:02,981 --> 01:25:04,630
it was a cute reference,
but it's also like what,

1556
01:25:04,631 --> 01:25:07,900
that's also a solution to your problem.
Yeah, exactly. He's get Tony Stark.

1557
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:12,370
It's like that Old Lord of the rings
thing where they're on an AI dragon at the

1558
01:25:12,371 --> 01:25:15,880
beginning of the,
like the first movie like that drag him,

1559
01:25:15,881 --> 01:25:17,980
took him somewhere or whatever.
Yeah. And then it's like,

1560
01:25:17,981 --> 01:25:20,200
why don't you just ride the
dragon to get the ring, you know,

1561
01:25:20,201 --> 01:25:21,530
why'd you have like
all these other things?

1562
01:25:21,820 --> 01:25:22,450
He's just,

1563
01:25:22,450 --> 01:25:25,170
I just completely checked out on all
the Lord of the rings movies because I'm

1564
01:25:25,171 --> 01:25:27,910
just such, not a, I'm not a
fan of any of the mythologies,

1565
01:25:27,990 --> 01:25:32,580
so I just was just like watching it just
for the pure spectacle of it each time

1566
01:25:32,581 --> 01:25:33,480
and like I couldn't,

1567
01:25:33,510 --> 01:25:35,910
I could barely tell you about anything
that happened in those movies.

1568
01:25:35,911 --> 01:25:38,460
My Dad and my Stepdad was a hippie and a,

1569
01:25:38,490 --> 01:25:42,030
he loved all the Rro token jr tokens.

1570
01:25:42,630 --> 01:25:43,870
I read a bunch of them when growing up.

1571
01:25:43,950 --> 01:25:47,520
I read that stuff when I was little
and I just never, it's, it's, you know,

1572
01:25:47,521 --> 01:25:51,180
like Mike to Genre that can work,
but it's like my least favorite.

1573
01:25:51,181 --> 01:25:53,910
Like I'm not excited about this
game of Thrones thing on Hbo.

1574
01:25:53,911 --> 01:25:57,000
I've tried watching it and it's, what
is it about? It's just, you know,

1575
01:25:57,550 --> 01:26:00,330
that kind of the middle
earth, you know, uh,

1576
01:26:00,780 --> 01:26:02,850
did they have dragons
fighting fantasy thing?

1577
01:26:03,220 --> 01:26:05,900
They have dragons in the game of
Thrones. Thanks. So yeah, really,

1578
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:09,710
I certainly talk about him. They talk
about genetics, a lot of talk and there,

1579
01:26:09,711 --> 01:26:13,640
you know, and it's got sex in it cause
it's HBO and, and you know, but I just,

1580
01:26:13,641 --> 01:26:16,070
I always end up like every episode,

1581
01:26:16,071 --> 01:26:19,040
I haven't gotten through the whole thing
without checking my Twitter or you know,

1582
01:26:19,041 --> 01:26:22,730
doing something else while it's on, you
know, whatever I think about sex and old,

1583
01:26:23,410 --> 01:26:27,770
any, anything Victorian era and you just
got to know how bad those fucking people

1584
01:26:27,771 --> 01:26:31,630
must have smelled back then. Got The
worst, the worst, their ass hole.

1585
01:26:31,640 --> 01:26:35,450
And then they don't like have more sour
expressions on their face all the time.

1586
01:26:35,451 --> 01:26:36,440
Like,
oh my God,

1587
01:26:36,441 --> 01:26:40,670
it's so [inaudible] smells like urine
this everywhere in this castle using

1588
01:26:40,890 --> 01:26:45,680
capitals like an asshole. You think
that people were like dogs back then?

1589
01:26:45,680 --> 01:26:48,680
It didn't bother them. Oh, maybe
they just get used to it. Yeah.

1590
01:26:48,681 --> 01:26:52,280
I mean maybe there's something thinking,
well you know you get used to smells.

1591
01:26:52,281 --> 01:26:55,790
That's the weird thing about smells
like a new sound like or sound rather.

1592
01:26:55,791 --> 01:26:59,300
You can have like, they'll stay that
way forever, it'll drive you crazy,

1593
01:26:59,450 --> 01:27:01,200
but if there's a shitty smell you're,

1594
01:27:01,270 --> 01:27:05,300
you're all factory sensors are only set
up to detect changes in smell so you can

1595
01:27:05,301 --> 01:27:09,230
get used to some sulfury nasty smelling
neighborhood. You can get news.

1596
01:27:09,290 --> 01:27:12,170
That's why when you drive through New
Jersey and there's some areas in New

1597
01:27:12,170 --> 01:27:16,250
Jersey where it's fucking
so badly polluted by plants,

1598
01:27:16,370 --> 01:27:19,770
by whatever chemical plants they
have there so badly polluted,

1599
01:27:19,820 --> 01:27:24,200
the air fucking stinks. I know for males,
I don't know if it's that way anymore,

1600
01:27:24,260 --> 01:27:26,990
but I remember when we were kids
and I was, I lived in Newark.

1601
01:27:27,140 --> 01:27:30,410
We would drive through certain
areas and it fucking stunk.

1602
01:27:30,440 --> 01:27:35,180
Whenever it drove up the up the
coast here through Santa Maria,

1603
01:27:35,330 --> 01:27:38,780
it always, is that a cow area? It might,

1604
01:27:38,781 --> 01:27:42,280
it's either a cow area or I people used
to always say paper mill because it

1605
01:27:42,290 --> 01:27:46,340
would smell Smith's smell like,
like you know, really bad farts.

1606
01:27:46,370 --> 01:27:48,890
How bad is that for those poor
fucks that have to work there?

1607
01:27:49,220 --> 01:27:52,680
I guess they do get used to it,
but maybe it's chemicals. Right.

1608
01:27:52,681 --> 01:27:56,510
Have you ever been like eating a tuna
tuna canning place or something like that?

1609
01:27:56,540 --> 01:28:00,580
No, that's the smell is insane. I had
to hang out on one day when I was uh,

1610
01:28:00,680 --> 01:28:03,440
standing in a for a movie.
Uh,

1611
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:08,400
they shot a scene in a real like fucking
tuna cannery down in Long Beach and is

1612
01:28:08,401 --> 01:28:11,210
supposed to be a period piece and the
place still looked like hell, you know,

1613
01:28:11,211 --> 01:28:15,340
so it still looked like it was all
dose Gary and a man that, that, that,

1614
01:28:15,370 --> 01:28:19,460
that place smelled so bad and just
hundreds of workers is that they're just,

1615
01:28:19,870 --> 01:28:22,670
you know, putting their hands in
it and smelling it all day long.

1616
01:28:22,740 --> 01:28:24,510
We've been to an Asian grocery store.

1617
01:28:24,511 --> 01:28:27,360
There's one out here in Northridge
that I went to recently.

1618
01:28:27,361 --> 01:28:32,220
And it cause you probably seek out Asian
grocery stores so you could tell this

1619
01:28:32,221 --> 01:28:35,160
story. No, I mean like have you ever
been into an Asian grocery store?

1620
01:28:35,450 --> 01:28:39,450
Like you went in for cigarettes
or something? No, I just
went in to get candy and

1621
01:28:41,010 --> 01:28:42,450
Japanese make great candy,

1622
01:28:43,290 --> 01:28:47,820
but you walk in and it smells like
fucking ass, just death of fish.

1623
01:28:47,850 --> 01:28:50,370
It smells just like the grow.
And they have like coolers,

1624
01:28:50,371 --> 01:28:54,360
like on the ground of just live crabs
and it's like crabs a dollar each and

1625
01:28:54,361 --> 01:28:58,410
they're just like huge buckets of crabs.
And then you go and there's like,

1626
01:28:58,470 --> 01:29:02,130
you could buy like octopuses
squids and they eat a lot

1627
01:29:02,130 --> 01:29:03,060
of freaky shit.
Yeah.

1628
01:29:03,061 --> 01:29:07,140
And there's just tons of fish completely
like with their heads on and stuff like

1629
01:29:07,141 --> 01:29:11,190
still alive, just in Saran wrap type
thing. And they're still moving a little.

1630
01:29:11,191 --> 01:29:15,120
You're just like, this is fucked
up the creek. Where is this place?

1631
01:29:15,121 --> 01:29:20,100
I got to check on receipt die in
Northridge. We did fear factor in a,

1632
01:29:20,101 --> 01:29:23,010
um, a slaughterhouse and
that was pretty dark man.

1633
01:29:23,310 --> 01:29:27,200
It was dark and smelled fucked up. It
smelled. It's, it's like, uh, like, uh,

1634
01:29:27,290 --> 01:29:30,900
a displeasure bill smell like you wanted
to get away. And it was a clean place.

1635
01:29:30,901 --> 01:29:32,940
They did a great, you know,
I mean it was very cool.

1636
01:29:33,240 --> 01:29:36,420
They even killed cows in a kosher
way. There, there was uh, you know,

1637
01:29:36,421 --> 01:29:37,290
they would slice her neck.

1638
01:29:37,291 --> 01:29:40,400
There was of two different ways they
would do them and one time they were doing

1639
01:29:40,410 --> 01:29:42,850
when a rabbi was there and they
would do it, would they have to,

1640
01:29:42,851 --> 01:29:44,730
you have to do it with a sharp
knife and slice the neck.

1641
01:29:44,730 --> 01:29:49,730
And so we had the weird stench to
it and we had a guy go crazy there.

1642
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:55,330
It was one of the few times on fear
factor was worried about my safety because

1643
01:29:55,700 --> 01:29:57,720
this stunt was a guy had a dunk his head,

1644
01:29:57,721 --> 01:29:59,730
everybody had a dunk their head in blood.

1645
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:04,110
We had this cow's blood and you had
to keep the cow's blood at 38 degrees.

1646
01:30:04,260 --> 01:30:06,690
It couldn't get any warmer
than that because around 40,

1647
01:30:06,691 --> 01:30:10,590
41 degrees he starts developing bacteria
like very quickly and you can get

1648
01:30:10,591 --> 01:30:12,600
incredibly ill.
So in order to do this,

1649
01:30:12,601 --> 01:30:16,530
we had to fill these vats up with
really fucking cold cow's blood.

1650
01:30:16,830 --> 01:30:19,920
And this guy was like one of those
Tony Robbins motivational guys.

1651
01:30:19,921 --> 01:30:23,370
Like he had bought like motivational
tapes and he had read books.

1652
01:30:23,371 --> 01:30:27,030
And he was like repeating his mantra
to him and he was standing outside.

1653
01:30:27,031 --> 01:30:30,240
He was a big guy, man. He was like
a football player. He was yoked.

1654
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:33,500
It was a lot bigger than me, man. And
he was standing in front of this, um,

1655
01:30:33,720 --> 01:30:37,680
like a side view mirror on a pickup
truck and he was talking to the mirror.

1656
01:30:37,890 --> 01:30:42,780
He was like, you are a winner.
You are a person who succeeds.

1657
01:30:42,900 --> 01:30:46,500
You are a person who sets
goals and accomplishing them.

1658
01:30:46,620 --> 01:30:50,160
And he was pacing back and forth and then
he would go back to that mirror and it

1659
01:30:50,161 --> 01:30:53,640
would say it over and over again. And he
was like all this positive affirmations.

1660
01:30:53,641 --> 01:30:57,240
And then I was like, oh my God, this guy
is crazy. And I just started taking off.

1661
01:30:57,241 --> 01:30:59,430
Fuck, this guy is crazy. We've
got a crazy guy in the show.

1662
01:30:59,431 --> 01:31:00,870
How do you screen this
crazy guy on the show?

1663
01:31:01,170 --> 01:31:04,380
And so then he gets to the time
where he has to do is stunt well,

1664
01:31:04,381 --> 01:31:07,530
there's a bunch of people before
him and they do it and girls do it.

1665
01:31:07,530 --> 01:31:12,000
All these people do it, but
he does it. And he starts
freaking out. He can't do it.

1666
01:31:12,001 --> 01:31:14,190
He can't. He's choking, he's choking.

1667
01:31:14,310 --> 01:31:16,500
You know the reason why it needs
all this crazy motivational shit.

1668
01:31:16,501 --> 01:31:20,970
He's got a fucking tornado of bullshit
and his brain and it just wins every time

1669
01:31:20,971 --> 01:31:24,180
something comes up and he just can't,
he can't accomplish things.

1670
01:31:24,330 --> 01:31:28,830
So he's in this fucking blood and he
starts swapping the blood dot fuck,

1671
01:31:29,010 --> 01:31:33,120
fuck. And he's screaming
and he's covered in blood.

1672
01:31:33,450 --> 01:31:35,940
And then I'm looking around
and these camera man,

1673
01:31:36,060 --> 01:31:39,720
and they all like smoke cigarettes.
They're out of shape. And you know,

1674
01:31:39,721 --> 01:31:42,210
there's like a little skinny guy.
I was holding their core and I'm like,

1675
01:31:42,360 --> 01:31:43,950
there's no security here.

1676
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:48,750
We've got a crazy guy covered in blood
and I'm going to tell him that he's

1677
01:31:48,751 --> 01:31:52,380
eliminated from the show. You just
took care of me to the prom. Exactly.

1678
01:31:53,820 --> 01:31:55,980
Ready for fucking lightning
bolts to come out of his eyes,

1679
01:31:55,981 --> 01:31:59,470
the place to go on fire. And we all
die in a Stephen King movie. I'd still,

1680
01:31:59,471 --> 01:32:02,830
we're always think about the one episode
where they blended the rat in the,

1681
01:32:02,831 --> 01:32:07,780
in the blender and they had
to drink liquid rat time
magazine's 10 gross moments

1682
01:32:07,781 --> 01:32:10,730
of reality television and we made it.
Yes.

1683
01:32:11,700 --> 01:32:16,510
Can you imagine doing that rat
hair mixed with the melted phones?

1684
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:18,790
It's the only thing I
don't like about reality.

1685
01:32:18,791 --> 01:32:22,540
Television is the gross out factor
is the best part. I'm a little crazy.

1686
01:32:22,541 --> 01:32:25,750
And what's the best part? So I think
the only thing worthwhile season,

1687
01:32:25,790 --> 01:32:30,350
it wasn't for fear factor was the first
time it wasn't for the beast. Yeah.

1688
01:32:30,870 --> 01:32:34,210
I have obviously a very different take
on it than the average person because

1689
01:32:34,211 --> 01:32:38,450
I've been through so much. I've seen
so much. I've seen more gross shit.

1690
01:32:39,070 --> 01:32:43,070
Any hundred people go, it's amazing what
wife threw up in her car. Just fuck.

1691
01:32:43,080 --> 01:32:43,690
She ate,

1692
01:32:43,690 --> 01:32:47,140
she worked out and she'd drink wheat
grass juice and she fucking puked all over

1693
01:32:47,141 --> 01:32:50,020
our car, all over the console,
over the seats, everything.

1694
01:32:50,021 --> 01:32:54,110
And she was so grossed out by it and she's
like, she's, she can't smell throw up.

1695
01:32:54,111 --> 01:32:57,610
If she sells, smells throw
up, she'll throw up again.
I'm like, I'll clean it up.

1696
01:32:57,640 --> 01:33:00,610
To me it was nothing. I'm
like, I see so much puke.

1697
01:33:00,700 --> 01:33:02,980
I was cleaning it up when I was a kid.
I remember when you were a kid,

1698
01:33:02,981 --> 01:33:07,120
you'd walk down the hallway and some
kid threw up and everybody below you'd

1699
01:33:07,121 --> 01:33:08,950
smell the throw up and
you'd have to throw up.

1700
01:33:09,100 --> 01:33:11,330
I could get right in and
poke around in it like,

1701
01:33:11,530 --> 01:33:14,930
like Molly and sculpture or whatever
those Scully and Mulder with a,

1702
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:18,850
with a pencil. I go look at that. There's
a sausage. That's a hot dog. You would be.

1703
01:33:18,851 --> 01:33:22,590
So you're completely unaffected
by the pie scene and um,

1704
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:26,440
stand by while I was young back then.
You know what I mean?

1705
01:33:26,441 --> 01:33:28,300
That is so disgusting.

1706
01:33:28,620 --> 01:33:32,530
I did once watching fear
factor on television.

1707
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:35,830
I never threw up when I was actually
there live when shit was going down.

1708
01:33:36,010 --> 01:33:39,340
But there was a girl that was eating a
cocktail glass full of worms and she was

1709
01:33:39,341 --> 01:33:41,960
having the hardest time eating it. And I
was telling her that she wasn't a flies.

1710
01:33:42,190 --> 01:33:42,940
No,
it was worms.

1711
01:33:42,940 --> 01:33:47,290
And she would hit a mouth hole warms and
she's chewing and she throws him up on

1712
01:33:47,291 --> 01:33:51,220
this dirty picnic table. Okay.
And I said, you can still win it.

1713
01:33:51,250 --> 01:33:53,050
You can still do it. You just got
to put them back in your mouth,

1714
01:33:53,110 --> 01:33:54,870
put it back into Mt Mouth.
So she's,

1715
01:33:54,871 --> 01:33:58,960
she's so grossed out by these worms that
she can't even pick them up with her

1716
01:33:58,961 --> 01:34:00,580
hands and put them in the glass.

1717
01:34:00,640 --> 01:34:03,940
She's trying to pick them up with
two glasses at the same time,

1718
01:34:04,060 --> 01:34:08,870
and she's slobbering and snots coming out
of her nose and she's crying and she's

1719
01:34:08,871 --> 01:34:12,190
shaking and she's getting
these two glasses together
and like, you can do this,

1720
01:34:12,191 --> 01:34:12,970
you can do this.
You get it.

1721
01:34:12,970 --> 01:34:16,750
She gets it back in her mouth and she
chucks it up again. I go, come on,

1722
01:34:16,751 --> 01:34:18,730
you've got plenty of time.
Scoop that back up.

1723
01:34:18,820 --> 01:34:23,320
And she did when she threw up the third
time when I ran the sink and just hurled

1724
01:34:23,500 --> 01:34:27,460
hurled into the sink. And I was like,
this is so ridiculous. Like there live,

1725
01:34:27,490 --> 01:34:32,020
I don't throw up but somehow or another
watching it on TV, you should, um,

1726
01:34:32,290 --> 01:34:34,390
you should isolate just the audio of that.

1727
01:34:34,540 --> 01:34:39,160
That fella totally sounded like
the GNARLIEST, sexy. Come on,

1728
01:34:39,161 --> 01:34:42,490
put it back in. You can win.
You can win it. Come on,

1729
01:34:42,550 --> 01:34:47,410
put it back yet they wouldn't even be
near your big black wouldn't even be

1730
01:34:47,411 --> 01:34:50,470
nearly the gnarliest. What's the
gnarliest sex shit you've ever seen?

1731
01:34:50,590 --> 01:34:55,210
That's really in the stumbling
department. I'm really careful. Like God,

1732
01:34:55,700 --> 01:35:00,700
I have a past with the trigger cause I
like what I like and I can't stand seeing

1733
01:35:00,741 --> 01:35:03,880
what I don't want. I don't like, you
know what I don't want to see. So I,

1734
01:35:04,180 --> 01:35:06,210
I've been really good
about, you know, yeah.

1735
01:35:06,220 --> 01:35:09,500
You have to in a certain surf around
on the specific sites where they're not

1736
01:35:09,501 --> 01:35:11,090
going to suddenly throw that stuff at me.

1737
01:35:11,120 --> 01:35:15,490
Like the New York city.com or something
like that. Or worldstar hip hop or no,

1738
01:35:15,830 --> 01:35:20,390
Dean de nyc.com I think is the worst.
It's one of the worst. Not Daily motion.

1739
01:35:20,420 --> 01:35:24,260
What's the one where there's lively,
lively, lively. It's got some dark shit.

1740
01:35:24,530 --> 01:35:26,360
Remember that we talked
about on one of the podcasts,

1741
01:35:26,460 --> 01:35:29,830
the girls with the high heels
and the kittens crushing,

1742
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:31,670
they cannot hear about
calls with the high. Yeah.

1743
01:35:31,700 --> 01:35:34,990
I wouldn't want to ever see that. It's
more kittens don't need to be crushed.

1744
01:35:35,020 --> 01:35:37,400
Yeah. Kittens and puppies and
shit like that. All that stuff.

1745
01:35:38,700 --> 01:35:43,160
Talk to me about it. That's all that
faces a death kind of stuff too.

1746
01:35:43,161 --> 01:35:45,440
Like when people started describing it,
I'm just like,

1747
01:35:45,470 --> 01:35:49,010
I just totally tried to check out because
anything that I can kind of remember,

1748
01:35:49,011 --> 01:35:52,430
I'll access it at some point and he
freaked out by it again. You know,

1749
01:35:53,030 --> 01:35:55,520
it's good to know that it's out there
though. You don't want to be naive.

1750
01:35:55,550 --> 01:35:58,850
You don't want to think that people
aren't capable of fucking heinous acts.

1751
01:35:58,850 --> 01:36:01,490
Like I used to have a real
thing about serial killers, man.

1752
01:36:01,491 --> 01:36:04,270
I read a lot of books on serial killers,
a little watch,

1753
01:36:04,280 --> 01:36:08,510
a lot of documentaries and part of it
was just some morbid fascination by like

1754
01:36:08,511 --> 01:36:09,860
the ice man or you know,

1755
01:36:09,861 --> 01:36:13,670
a couple of other different ones like
John Wayne Gacy and Ed gain who used to

1756
01:36:13,671 --> 01:36:17,060
make lamps out of people and
dresses at a women's skin. You know,

1757
01:36:17,061 --> 01:36:18,620
when Gacy he was a clown,

1758
01:36:18,621 --> 01:36:23,030
he dressed up as a clown and fucked and
kills like a hundred kids and Bergen him

1759
01:36:23,031 --> 01:36:25,070
in his basement or
something insane like that.

1760
01:36:25,440 --> 01:36:27,740
Why hasn't there been a
comedian's Hillary or killer yet?

1761
01:36:28,220 --> 01:36:32,000
The problem has probably has no way it'll
will do. So like a known can be like,

1762
01:36:32,030 --> 01:36:33,970
you know, not, well, not super well known,

1763
01:36:33,971 --> 01:36:37,850
but well known enough to be able to do
the circuit tour and then, you know,

1764
01:36:37,851 --> 01:36:38,181
cause it,

1765
01:36:38,181 --> 01:36:41,360
cause the charter flight
for a serial killer would be
moving around all the time.

1766
01:36:41,390 --> 01:36:43,850
Charles Fleischer murders,
he's getting, he's got to go.

1767
01:36:43,870 --> 01:36:47,660
It used to be in all these towns, you
know, somebody eventually catch up to you,

1768
01:36:47,661 --> 01:36:50,720
I'd imagine. Do you remember that one
guy that got busted for rape? Yeah.

1769
01:36:50,721 --> 01:36:54,170
There was a guy who was a kind of a
serial rapist, do colleges and stuff.

1770
01:36:54,440 --> 01:36:56,780
Vince champ. That's his name. Yeah,

1771
01:36:57,120 --> 01:36:59,450
that was shocking as all hell
because he was one of those comics.

1772
01:36:59,451 --> 01:37:03,440
It was squeaky clean and all of his jokes
were about boogers and stuff and then

1773
01:37:03,441 --> 01:37:05,090
like, all right, and he's also a rapist.

1774
01:37:05,170 --> 01:37:07,850
That's the ones who are going to
watch out for like a guy like you.

1775
01:37:07,851 --> 01:37:10,430
You kind of put it all out there,
you know,

1776
01:37:10,431 --> 01:37:12,980
he didn't have to worry about
Doug Benson raping you. Yeah.

1777
01:37:12,981 --> 01:37:15,500
Those guys with those squeezy
says he's going to rape you.

1778
01:37:15,501 --> 01:37:19,010
You know it's on and you should
get reach for your car case.

1779
01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:21,110
I think that you know a person who's not,

1780
01:37:21,140 --> 01:37:23,690
you know who has like a
really suppressed act.

1781
01:37:23,720 --> 01:37:26,420
That's the bottles up inside
of you if you're a freak.

1782
01:37:26,690 --> 01:37:30,080
And a lot of these guys are, a lot of
the clean people are really freaky.

1783
01:37:30,320 --> 01:37:30,801
You know,
I've,

1784
01:37:30,801 --> 01:37:34,490
I know a lot of clean comics that go to
hookers and shit and do a lot of weird

1785
01:37:34,491 --> 01:37:38,750
deviant shit and their Sgo wiki
clean on stage. And I'm like,

1786
01:37:38,751 --> 01:37:41,870
it's almost like you need to blow
off that steam. It's like, you know,

1787
01:37:42,020 --> 01:37:43,760
you're onstage and you're so suppressed.

1788
01:37:43,761 --> 01:37:46,400
Like you can't wait to go to the dark
side as soon as you get the fuck away from

1789
01:37:46,401 --> 01:37:50,420
people. Man, when you see some guys
doing like a fucking a boat act,

1790
01:37:50,730 --> 01:37:54,020
he's one of those crews guys.
But it's really a, you know,

1791
01:37:54,021 --> 01:37:56,010
on the other hand it can
be marketable because

1792
01:37:56,010 --> 01:37:58,800
I think that as hilarious as they are,
they're two of my favorites.

1793
01:37:58,801 --> 01:38:03,240
Jim Gaffigan and Brian Regan, both
are squeaky clean and that, you know,

1794
01:38:03,241 --> 01:38:05,070
so families can go see them.
You know,

1795
01:38:05,071 --> 01:38:08,100
like I'll get the occasional weird
family comes to check me out. But like,

1796
01:38:08,101 --> 01:38:10,140
you know, I can't get all ages. You know,

1797
01:38:10,290 --> 01:38:13,950
I got a bunch of family people were a
guy with his kids that ran out of my show

1798
01:38:13,951 --> 01:38:17,840
in Toronto and I feel bad. I'm
sorry sir. I'm sorry. I did.

1799
01:38:18,600 --> 01:38:20,640
I can't change the act for your kids.

1800
01:38:20,700 --> 01:38:24,240
I didn't know you're going to bring 15
year olds and when they got up and split

1801
01:38:24,241 --> 01:38:27,780
like I was doing during what bit jokes
about fake babies getting their dick

1802
01:38:27,781 --> 01:38:28,614
sucked.

1803
01:38:32,130 --> 01:38:36,380
That was it. I was trying to let them
know it's not a real baby I made.

1804
01:38:36,390 --> 01:38:37,380
It's all in my act.

1805
01:38:37,540 --> 01:38:40,560
No real babies were blown during the
making of any of my material. Yeah. Yeah.

1806
01:38:40,561 --> 01:38:43,450
You got to say that right? You don't want
social services knocking on your door,

1807
01:38:43,550 --> 01:38:48,060
man. How'd you come up with is JB
blower? How'd you come up with this joke?

1808
01:38:48,460 --> 01:38:51,090
Um, but what were we talking
about? The led into this?

1809
01:38:51,120 --> 01:38:54,750
Did you drive around
this joke? Um, I forget.

1810
01:38:56,250 --> 01:39:00,120
I forget. You're talking on the side and
then like the talking about rape area.

1811
01:39:00,720 --> 01:39:05,160
Oh, squeaky clean. What happened? The
Toronto, the guy, the people in Toronto,

1812
01:39:05,161 --> 01:39:08,190
they just left and I heard about it later.
He was very upset.

1813
01:39:08,220 --> 01:39:10,980
Do you think he listens to this?
No. I'm sure he doesn't. Maybe.

1814
01:39:10,981 --> 01:39:13,580
I'm hoping they'll hear about, kind of
know that that sort of stuff comes up.

1815
01:39:13,790 --> 01:39:14,640
Yeah.
What do,

1816
01:39:14,641 --> 01:39:17,310
we were talking about what's clean
comic versus dirty comics that you could

1817
01:39:17,311 --> 01:39:20,430
bring your family to Gaffigan
show and to Brian Regan show.

1818
01:39:20,550 --> 01:39:22,710
But the difference is that's
how those guys really are.

1819
01:39:22,830 --> 01:39:26,870
Like Brian Regan is one of the nicest
guys I've ever met in my lightheart. Yeah.

1820
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:28,050
And he's always been like that.

1821
01:39:28,051 --> 01:39:32,280
I've known Brian Regan since like 1992
or three I met him, I think I'm at,

1822
01:39:32,281 --> 01:39:34,440
I'm at the Montreal comedy
festival and he's always,

1823
01:39:34,441 --> 01:39:38,570
he never preaches about like, he
doesn't a lot of clean comics, you know,

1824
01:39:38,580 --> 01:39:41,790
hold it over your head. Like I can, I
can get big laughs without being dirty,

1825
01:39:41,791 --> 01:39:44,040
you know, like they make a big deal
out of it, but he never does that.

1826
01:39:44,041 --> 01:39:47,460
He's super nice about it. It's so
silly. That's so silly. Like, you know,

1827
01:39:47,490 --> 01:39:51,390
I had Africans got a dark side,
funny, funny Gaffigan does.

1828
01:39:52,350 --> 01:39:56,670
In what way? He just, you know, he, I know
he likes hearing and telling dirty jokes.

1829
01:39:56,671 --> 01:40:00,090
He's just chosen to be, could
be clean because it's, you know,

1830
01:40:00,120 --> 01:40:03,270
because he's good at it.
Oh, I see. He's hilarious.

1831
01:40:04,080 --> 01:40:08,670
It's almost like he's kind of forcing
himself to Barite funnier jokes because he

1832
01:40:08,671 --> 01:40:12,300
can't, you know, can't just throw in
random f bombs and stuff. That's true.

1833
01:40:12,330 --> 01:40:17,250
But I don't, you know, I think you can
do both. I want it all. I don't like,

1834
01:40:17,350 --> 01:40:20,630
I don't like rules. Like, yeah,
like j Morgan tweeted one day, uh,

1835
01:40:20,740 --> 01:40:24,090
you show me a comic with notes on stage
and I'll show you the summit in somebody

1836
01:40:24,091 --> 01:40:28,080
is not a real comic. And it's just
like, that's silly. You know what,

1837
01:40:28,240 --> 01:40:30,210
why can't you get notes?
It's a performance style.

1838
01:40:30,211 --> 01:40:33,900
Like if as long as the audience is getting
as many laughs, you know what I mean?

1839
01:40:33,901 --> 01:40:36,060
What difference does it make?
Well, you know, not only that,

1840
01:40:36,090 --> 01:40:38,460
what if you're working on some new shit,
it doesn't mean it's not ready.

1841
01:40:38,461 --> 01:40:40,170
It doesn't mean you have a
bunch of other shit to go to,

1842
01:40:40,171 --> 01:40:42,750
but there's a way to work on
some new shit and you know,

1843
01:40:42,780 --> 01:40:44,790
there's nothing wrong with having
some fucking notes up there, man.

1844
01:40:44,850 --> 01:40:47,940
As long as you're appreciative of the
audience's attention span and you're not

1845
01:40:47,941 --> 01:40:52,870
like, I don't like when people are
going through their nose. No, no, no.

1846
01:40:53,060 --> 01:40:54,160
It was not good enough.

1847
01:40:54,220 --> 01:40:58,330
Yeah. Yeah. I've seen some people do that
and I don't appreciate it as a comic,

1848
01:40:58,331 --> 01:41:00,760
I don't appreciate it. Forget about being
a person who actually paid to see it.

1849
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,970
Yeah, but it's nothing wrong with
notes. I don't give a fuck what you do.

1850
01:41:03,971 --> 01:41:07,030
If it's funny, I don't care if you've got
a guitar. I don't care what you do, man.

1851
01:41:07,210 --> 01:41:07,660
I'm not.

1852
01:41:07,660 --> 01:41:10,540
I think it's silly all that you know
he's not a real this or you're not a real

1853
01:41:10,541 --> 01:41:12,820
that stop it. Stop it. Yeah.

1854
01:41:12,821 --> 01:41:15,490
I did and I don't know if it was Jay
Morris said that it might've been,

1855
01:41:16,720 --> 01:41:20,380
might've been carrot top lucky we didn't
go off on Jay more carrot top says that

1856
01:41:20,830 --> 01:41:23,950
to make props cooler, but at
least I don't have notes. Yeah,

1857
01:41:23,951 --> 01:41:25,730
you just have the joke
written on each prop,

1858
01:41:25,800 --> 01:41:29,560
afraid class that it was he picking up.
Somebody had a great point.

1859
01:41:29,561 --> 01:41:33,310
Who the hell was it? That
had a great point that he
destroyed a whole genre. Yeah.

1860
01:41:33,380 --> 01:41:36,610
There's no more prop comics. It's like
you have to be carrot top to do it.

1861
01:41:36,670 --> 01:41:39,840
It was Daniel Tosh, I credit Daniel
Tosh. We were hanging out, uh,

1862
01:41:39,850 --> 01:41:42,790
when we were doing the thing,
we were, Daniel tosh gets
punched by Manny Pacquiao.

1863
01:41:42,910 --> 01:41:45,460
I was his corner man. And I'll try to
talk him out of it. I'm like, do it.

1864
01:41:45,461 --> 01:41:46,590
Don't do it.
You're gonna get brain damage.

1865
01:41:46,610 --> 01:41:49,150
Get out of this guy's one of the greatest
ever and you've got to let them punch

1866
01:41:49,160 --> 01:41:50,530
in the face.
Are you fucking crazy?

1867
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:53,410
So he goes out and it was pretty
funny and he did get hit pretty hard.

1868
01:41:53,590 --> 01:41:56,770
But tosh pointed it out and he's like,
there's no upcoming prop comes.

1869
01:41:56,771 --> 01:42:00,790
He used to be a genre, like when we were
open, Miker is used to be all that guy.

1870
01:42:00,820 --> 01:42:04,480
Oh, he's a guitar guy. Oh, that guy. He's
a prop guy. Did that prompt, got jugglers?

1871
01:42:04,481 --> 01:42:06,860
Magicians ventriloquists yeah,
like there's,

1872
01:42:07,030 --> 01:42:11,110
there's just one or none of all of them
now. Jeff Dunham's the Ventriloquist,

1873
01:42:11,500 --> 01:42:13,690
there's no famous juggler.
There's no guy that's like,

1874
01:42:13,691 --> 01:42:16,990
that's the guy that juggles,
which doesn't even exist anymore.

1875
01:42:16,991 --> 01:42:19,210
I wish Dunkin would
bring back little Hobo,

1876
01:42:19,240 --> 01:42:22,390
one of the greatest
ventriloquist hacks ever stolen.

1877
01:42:22,420 --> 01:42:26,170
Dunkin had a dummy called Little
Hobo and he used to close with it.

1878
01:42:26,171 --> 01:42:29,710
He had to close with it cause it was so
crazy and outrageous that there was no

1879
01:42:29,711 --> 01:42:32,980
room for it anywhere else. He had a,
he had a finished with it and he, uh,

1880
01:42:33,080 --> 01:42:35,470
somewhere where did it get
stolen from San Francisco.

1881
01:42:35,590 --> 01:42:38,770
We actually spoke to no room, a
no from a comedy club, but Martha,

1882
01:42:38,771 --> 01:42:42,700
fuck whoever you are, you piece of shit
actually talked to him. He was like,

1883
01:42:42,701 --> 01:42:46,660
you should do that again. That's a good
idea. And so he made an impression.

1884
01:42:46,740 --> 01:42:51,660
Yeah. Hey everybody. Hi.
That's a great idea. Hey Ari,

1885
01:42:51,661 --> 01:42:52,494
how's it going?

1886
01:42:52,630 --> 01:42:55,030
[inaudible] word is that an orange

1887
01:42:56,800 --> 01:43:01,580
wasn't cock sucker. What's
what the questions? Yeah.
Um, he's a, he's a great guy.

1888
01:43:01,581 --> 01:43:04,250
Dunkin and that fucking
puppet ACC was awesome.

1889
01:43:04,251 --> 01:43:07,850
He used to do this pink Floyd song. Have
you ever seen it? Ever seen his closer?

1890
01:43:08,030 --> 01:43:09,740
Oh my god,
it was genius.

1891
01:43:09,950 --> 01:43:14,300
This is genius about say tannic
puppet that killed his grandfather.

1892
01:43:14,510 --> 01:43:16,320
It's gotta be on Youtube
or, yeah, the gray.

1893
01:43:16,370 --> 01:43:20,720
What it is is the grandfather leaves
behind the puppet and the grandfather had

1894
01:43:20,721 --> 01:43:23,540
one wish that he wanted to
be buried with his puppet,

1895
01:43:23,690 --> 01:43:26,960
but he wanted Dunkin to go onstage
at the puppet the night before he was

1896
01:43:26,961 --> 01:43:30,620
supposed to be buried and just give
little Hobo one chance to say goodbye to

1897
01:43:30,621 --> 01:43:31,454
everybody.

1898
01:43:31,550 --> 01:43:35,270
So little hobos on stage with Dunkin
and little Hobo starts confessing to the

1899
01:43:35,271 --> 01:43:38,900
murder and then talking. It goes into
a trance and starts singing pink Floyd.

1900
01:43:38,900 --> 01:43:42,920
Wish you were here. They both sing at
the same time. It's fucking genius.

1901
01:43:42,950 --> 01:43:47,870
It's so good. And he's a
good ventriloquist. No, it's
terrible. So there's a secret,

1902
01:43:47,900 --> 01:43:50,330
but here's a secret. I can't,
I can't tell how he does it,

1903
01:43:50,420 --> 01:43:55,070
but it's really planned and the ending
is fucking awesome. It looks so, so good.

1904
01:43:55,071 --> 01:43:56,750
He couldn't follow it.
Yeah, he used to have to,

1905
01:43:56,751 --> 01:44:00,050
he used to have to close with it and I
used to always carried around in this

1906
01:44:00,051 --> 01:44:03,800
beat up suitcase. He's the,
he's one of my favorite people.

1907
01:44:03,980 --> 01:44:05,300
He's one of those dudes were,

1908
01:44:06,080 --> 01:44:09,080
no, he's going to come from
some weird fucking angle.

1909
01:44:09,260 --> 01:44:12,530
Like I could call Dunkin at three o'clock
in the morning and it'll go, dude,

1910
01:44:12,531 --> 01:44:15,740
I'm here watching ants in a death spiral.

1911
01:44:16,200 --> 01:44:20,570
Here's ants on youtube. And apparently
the fear Moans and some of the ants,

1912
01:44:20,630 --> 01:44:24,260
they're following a smell, but the queen
has died so they don't know where to go.

1913
01:44:24,410 --> 01:44:27,680
So they're all going out and they'll
go in that circle until they die.

1914
01:44:28,190 --> 01:44:31,130
Fuck far out,
man.

1915
01:44:33,340 --> 01:44:37,000
Those people you need in your life, man,
you have to cultivate them. That's like,

1916
01:44:37,150 --> 01:44:40,600
that's like the, the, the rare
flower that grew in tangled,

1917
01:44:40,780 --> 01:44:45,730
that kept mother Goethals alive. That's
what it's like. It's rare to find though.

1918
01:44:45,790 --> 01:44:48,850
It's good to have somebody that always
you, you know they're going to amuse you.

1919
01:44:48,910 --> 01:44:53,380
Yeah. You know, it's, it's a
nice experience to be like,
oh, I talked to this guy,

1920
01:44:53,381 --> 01:44:54,430
he's going to say something funny.

1921
01:44:54,431 --> 01:44:58,420
And that's what doctor drew doesn't
fucking have in his life and bring this

1922
01:44:58,421 --> 01:45:01,330
around full circle.
We're coming into the home front folks.

1923
01:45:01,600 --> 01:45:06,350
He's got so many comedians on his show
that all smoke on love line that I had

1924
01:45:06,570 --> 01:45:09,220
been on a bunch of times. I
don't know this, this clip is a,

1925
01:45:09,221 --> 01:45:12,550
I'm not saying it's not real, but
I'm just writing. I'm just wondering,

1926
01:45:13,540 --> 01:45:15,370
I'm not trying to start
any conspiracy theories.

1927
01:45:15,370 --> 01:45:20,200
You can Osama bin Ladin type shit
son. I still think that um, that it's,

1928
01:45:20,410 --> 01:45:23,230
he's kind of changed a little bit.
It's Kinda like, you know, Trump,

1929
01:45:24,020 --> 01:45:27,130
it's going to fall back on us.
All of his opinions or just the,

1930
01:45:27,280 --> 01:45:29,380
just a standard boiler plate.

1931
01:45:29,750 --> 01:45:32,980
What you should say to please the GOP
and he didn't used to feel any of those

1932
01:45:32,981 --> 01:45:35,410
things and you still like,
that's why you can't actually run,

1933
01:45:35,411 --> 01:45:38,490
cause they're going to dig up so much
stuff on him. It's just going to be like,

1934
01:45:38,540 --> 01:45:43,180
what are you, hold on. Newt Gingrich
thinks he can be president. You silly.

1935
01:45:43,181 --> 01:45:45,610
Fuck Newt Gingrich,
by the way,

1936
01:45:45,611 --> 01:45:50,611
was cheating on his wife while they were
having Clinton and parading him around

1937
01:45:51,401 --> 01:45:53,140
on television for being an adulterer.

1938
01:45:53,260 --> 01:45:57,310
Don't that whole time they were
going after Clinton impeaching him.

1939
01:45:57,580 --> 01:46:01,030
He was cheating on his wife.
Yeah, but that's, that's the,

1940
01:46:01,031 --> 01:46:03,610
that's what's changed is now they
can go after somebody about a birth

1941
01:46:03,611 --> 01:46:05,640
certificate cause they've
got one of those. Yeah.

1942
01:46:05,720 --> 01:46:09,910
They're not going to be a hypocrite.
Fuck the fuck man. I'm not a racist.

1943
01:46:09,911 --> 01:46:13,240
Newt Gingrich. You fucked up
dude. You can't be king. No,

1944
01:46:13,300 --> 01:46:15,820
you're going to have to accept
that. Go write books. Go be bitter.

1945
01:46:15,910 --> 01:46:18,520
Go drink at a bar somewhere and
tell people could have been,

1946
01:46:18,700 --> 01:46:22,360
but you can be really interesting to see
if the Republican's come up with like

1947
01:46:22,361 --> 01:46:25,420
their Obama if like somebody
really catches fire out of nowhere.

1948
01:46:25,600 --> 01:46:30,270
I know Sarah Palin's. Nice. Yeah. Really.

1949
01:46:30,870 --> 01:46:32,230
She loved the girl.
He yelled out.

1950
01:46:32,231 --> 01:46:36,970
My aunt is Sarah Pailin and I've got
an inside scoop because I met her.

1951
01:46:38,700 --> 01:46:43,700
That was the most obscure call back ever
two hours ago and I've no idea what was

1952
01:46:43,931 --> 01:46:48,830
happening then. I don't know who the fuck
is going to run for president, but I,

1953
01:46:48,831 --> 01:46:49,980
I would hope there would be at

1954
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:53,340
least one option,
like a Gary Johnson or Ron Paul,

1955
01:46:53,460 --> 01:46:55,380
one person who has sense.

1956
01:46:55,470 --> 01:46:59,700
One person who represents moderate
people who just want to be left the fuck

1957
01:46:59,701 --> 01:47:04,050
alone, not this ridiculous battle of
left and right. That's not even a real,

1958
01:47:04,200 --> 01:47:07,740
there's gay marriage or gun control and
all these issues that they keep throwing

1959
01:47:07,741 --> 01:47:09,170
up that that's,
it's,

1960
01:47:09,330 --> 01:47:13,230
they're all giant distractions while
they rob you and fucking steal money left

1961
01:47:13,231 --> 01:47:16,860
and right. No matter what we do,
people are still going to have guns.

1962
01:47:16,920 --> 01:47:18,690
People are still going to get abortions,

1963
01:47:18,920 --> 01:47:21,660
but gay people are going to have
sex with each other for real.

1964
01:47:22,200 --> 01:47:24,420
People are gonna smoke weed.
You know what I'm saying?

1965
01:47:24,421 --> 01:47:27,870
All these things that they're fighting
so hard to stop are not going away.

1966
01:47:27,990 --> 01:47:30,720
Big Black Dick. When you realize
that, you know, we have everything.

1967
01:47:30,810 --> 01:47:33,120
There's people listening to
this podcast or drunk as fuck.

1968
01:47:33,810 --> 01:47:36,690
I pulled off the Joe Rogan drinking
game though. I do. Like I said,

1969
01:47:36,691 --> 01:47:39,800
I was going to do every time
Goldberg goes to take a pee, um,

1970
01:47:39,990 --> 01:47:41,550
I tell people to take a shot.

1971
01:47:41,920 --> 01:47:45,300
This is the Joe Rogan drinking game
because Mike Goldberg drinks a ton of Red

1972
01:47:45,300 --> 01:47:48,330
Bulls when we work together. And,
uh, you know, he's, you know,

1973
01:47:48,331 --> 01:47:51,750
he's fucking very professionally wants
to be hyped up and he has to pay all the

1974
01:47:51,751 --> 01:47:52,200
time.

1975
01:47:52,200 --> 01:47:56,940
The record for him peeing during a a
six hour broadcast is six times he gets,

1976
01:47:56,941 --> 01:48:00,450
I don't pee at all.
I sit down and sometimes if I can,

1977
01:48:00,540 --> 01:48:02,580
like if like there's a
break of like 20 minutes,

1978
01:48:02,581 --> 01:48:04,920
like there's been a bunch of
quick first round knockouts,

1979
01:48:05,040 --> 01:48:06,750
I'll get a chance and then I'll run,
take a,

1980
01:48:06,900 --> 01:48:09,210
take a leak and maybe even grab a quick
sandwich or something like that and then

1981
01:48:09,211 --> 01:48:12,930
sit back down again. Goldberg does it
all the time in the middle of the show.

1982
01:48:13,020 --> 01:48:16,950
So live on paper view. He runs to
the bathroom and then runs back.

1983
01:48:17,070 --> 01:48:21,210
So I told people that if you see the
fighter walking and the fact that music is

1984
01:48:21,211 --> 01:48:23,880
playing,
but I'm the only one talking take a shot.

1985
01:48:24,150 --> 01:48:27,690
Cause that means Goldberg's Peon and he
actually said it on the last paper view.

1986
01:48:27,691 --> 01:48:29,610
If you're playing the
drinking home game at home,

1987
01:48:29,640 --> 01:48:32,730
did Danny say anything about it?
That is always a good two,

1988
01:48:32,731 --> 01:48:35,460
three minute stretch
to go pee because yeah,

1989
01:48:35,461 --> 01:48:38,860
it's just a guy parading down
the middle of the, the island.

1990
01:48:38,870 --> 01:48:42,120
It's always exciting when you're there.
And there's also the conversations,

1991
01:48:42,121 --> 01:48:44,190
you know, like he's not gonna
be able to handle my power.

1992
01:48:44,191 --> 01:48:45,570
He's not gonna be able
to do with my speed.

1993
01:48:45,690 --> 01:48:48,480
This is a totally different kind of
athleticism. And then the other guy says,

1994
01:48:48,481 --> 01:48:51,090
you know, I got more experience. I'm
down, you know, I'm, I don't care.

1995
01:48:51,091 --> 01:48:53,480
I'm ready to go to war.
I'm going to die.dot, dot.

1996
01:48:53,490 --> 01:48:56,190
And the music plays and
walk up and the whole thing.

1997
01:48:56,280 --> 01:48:59,360
Doug Benson is a big UFC fan and
you went to a bunch of them. Yeah,

1998
01:48:59,400 --> 01:49:01,770
because it's like they show you,
they treat everything.

1999
01:49:01,920 --> 01:49:03,630
They do it just the right way they like,

2000
01:49:03,631 --> 01:49:06,420
and they show you everything you need to
know about each of the fighters on the

2001
01:49:06,421 --> 01:49:07,254
big screens.

2002
01:49:07,410 --> 01:49:10,140
Then they'd come in to their own music
that they've selected and they're all

2003
01:49:10,141 --> 01:49:12,480
pumped up. And you know,
in the case of Toronto,

2004
01:49:12,481 --> 01:49:14,040
there was a lot of Canadian fighters.

2005
01:49:14,041 --> 01:49:17,730
So the crowd was very much on the side
of the Canadian in each fight and,

2006
01:49:17,731 --> 01:49:19,380
but you just get so pumped up.

2007
01:49:19,381 --> 01:49:22,560
It's like seeing a trailer for an action
movie and then getting to see that

2008
01:49:22,561 --> 01:49:25,980
action movie right away instead of having
to go home and think about it like,

2009
01:49:26,550 --> 01:49:27,690
like they really set it up.

2010
01:49:27,690 --> 01:49:31,050
They really make you want to see these
guys fight and then you get to see them

2011
01:49:31,051 --> 01:49:33,480
fight.
And sometimes it's like amazingly quick.

2012
01:49:33,810 --> 01:49:38,070
And that in Toronto there was every
different kind of ending. If I could have,

2013
01:49:38,390 --> 01:49:41,450
you know, things went to a decision.
There was, there was knockouts,

2014
01:49:41,640 --> 01:49:46,560
there was a choke out. There was a boring
fight. Exciting fights. Yeah. Yeah.

2015
01:49:46,561 --> 01:49:48,700
It really was all
different kinds of fights.

2016
01:49:49,030 --> 01:49:51,190
Fights are important for two reasons.
One,

2017
01:49:51,191 --> 01:49:53,440
they make you appreciate the
exciting fights, you know,

2018
01:49:53,441 --> 01:49:56,800
because there's going to be fights and
there's going to be fights where guys,

2019
01:49:56,801 --> 01:49:59,970
it's not that they're not good, it's just
they cancel each other out, you know?

2020
01:50:00,050 --> 01:50:01,300
That's really all it is.

2021
01:50:01,301 --> 01:50:04,120
And sometimes when you got
guys that are equally talented,

2022
01:50:04,360 --> 01:50:06,610
it's a boring fucking fight,
especially when they're really good.

2023
01:50:06,611 --> 01:50:08,740
Grapplers like sometimes
just nothing happens,

2024
01:50:08,860 --> 01:50:12,850
but then the next fight will be some
crazy fucking head kick knock out and

2025
01:50:12,851 --> 01:50:15,360
you'll really appreciate
it. You know, just, yeah,

2026
01:50:15,430 --> 01:50:19,300
nothing more exciting than the guy that
actually ran up the chain link fence and

2027
01:50:19,301 --> 01:50:21,700
kicked a dude and the Anthony
Pettis that that they,

2028
01:50:21,701 --> 01:50:24,460
I see that clip every time I go
and it has, that is the most,

2029
01:50:24,490 --> 01:50:26,370
that is like movie shit that is,

2030
01:50:26,440 --> 01:50:30,640
that is only guys on wires making a
movie can do that. Not only did he do it,

2031
01:50:30,670 --> 01:50:35,670
he did it in the fifth round
of a championship fight
where it was neck and neck

2032
01:50:36,670 --> 01:50:38,650
up to that moment.
It was anybody's fight.

2033
01:50:38,830 --> 01:50:40,930
Literally up to that round he
was winning the whole round,

2034
01:50:40,990 --> 01:50:45,580
but up to that round it was anybody's
fight and he comes in with this crazy kick

2035
01:50:45,581 --> 01:50:49,570
and knocks him down. He's the greatest
kick I've ever seen in my life in Toronto.

2036
01:50:49,571 --> 01:50:54,571
That guy was it hammock that
had the had the Hematoma?

2037
01:50:54,820 --> 01:50:56,620
Yeah.
Somebody on Twitter said it passed.

2038
01:50:56,620 --> 01:51:00,940
It said it looked like a breast implant
right after we were like elephant man or

2039
01:51:00,941 --> 01:51:02,440
like it was horrifying.
It was a restaurant.

2040
01:51:02,441 --> 01:51:05,260
And right after I read breast implant I
was like God why didn't I think of that?

2041
01:51:05,261 --> 01:51:07,760
And he, but he almost came back
from that. He all, you know,

2042
01:51:07,780 --> 01:51:09,280
towards the end of the fight he really,

2043
01:51:09,281 --> 01:51:12,550
it was very exciting because prior to
that it was just watching a guy get

2044
01:51:12,551 --> 01:51:14,830
punched in his hematoma was,
it was brutal.

2045
01:51:14,860 --> 01:51:19,150
Well apparently Joe say Aldo had a
staph infection and that's why he looked

2046
01:51:19,151 --> 01:51:21,730
great in the beginning of the fight but
tired cause usually it doesn't tire.

2047
01:51:21,731 --> 01:51:23,800
He's a,
he's a fucking machine.

2048
01:51:24,070 --> 01:51:27,360
And I asked him about it after the fight
cause I knew he had a hard wait cut too.

2049
01:51:27,510 --> 01:51:28,990
But he in his corner,

2050
01:51:28,991 --> 01:51:33,310
apparently in Portuguese he said to one
of his corner men something about the

2051
01:51:33,311 --> 01:51:36,960
antibiotics. Like I should've taken more
antibiotics, has cornered, I said nothing.

2052
01:51:36,970 --> 01:51:39,190
You defend your title, you did a
great job, don't worry about it.

2053
01:51:39,370 --> 01:51:42,880
And then afterwards they said that he
had a staph infection and took an extreme

2054
01:51:42,881 --> 01:51:46,900
dose of antibiotics to try to cure it
as quick as possible, but thinks that,

2055
01:51:46,901 --> 01:51:50,080
you know, he didn't really, it wasn't
really 100% when he got in there. So,

2056
01:51:50,081 --> 01:51:55,081
which is amazing cause hammock is a really
bad ass dude and to be able to handle

2057
01:51:55,091 --> 01:51:59,110
harmonic while you're fucking sick from
antibiotics and a staph infection. Yeah.

2058
01:51:59,111 --> 01:52:02,370
Yeah. But that definitely explains
that last round. Like he really,

2059
01:52:02,371 --> 01:52:05,500
you talking back but it was too late
to, you know, to get the decision. Yeah.

2060
01:52:05,501 --> 01:52:07,630
He just kind of held on the last run.
He couldn't do anything.

2061
01:52:07,631 --> 01:52:10,750
And that's not like him at all. If you
look at his fight, like with Uriah Faber,

2062
01:52:10,830 --> 01:52:13,690
you're right favors of beats and he
beat the shit out of your Ira for five

2063
01:52:13,691 --> 01:52:16,960
rounds and he never got tired.
I mean it was just a, a beating.

2064
01:52:17,050 --> 01:52:21,360
It was a rye as a former champion
and he just could not fuck with all,

2065
01:52:21,430 --> 01:52:23,620
although it's just all over
him and he never got tired.

2066
01:52:24,040 --> 01:52:27,280
When you have a staph infection or if
you're on any kind of antibiotics like

2067
01:52:27,281 --> 01:52:29,860
that. I've had both. And
it's a draining thing.

2068
01:52:29,970 --> 01:52:32,530
It's your ads are going to be groggy
enough from getting hit in the face.

2069
01:52:32,531 --> 01:52:36,550
You don't need that extra. Yeah. Will
you be like Shitty, slow feeling weak.

2070
01:52:36,580 --> 01:52:38,560
Most people can't even
wrap their head around.

2071
01:52:38,561 --> 01:52:42,880
Would it be like to have to hit a bag for
25 minutes? You're fight five minutes.

2072
01:52:43,120 --> 01:52:46,010
Yeah. Five minute rounds.
Go hit a bag and the bag

2073
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:49,310
doesn't even hit back. You would
drop dead of a fucking heart attack.

2074
01:52:49,311 --> 01:52:52,220
Like you have to be an incredible
condition to pull that off.

2075
01:52:52,340 --> 01:52:55,370
And then you add the fact that the other
guy's hitting you and then you have the

2076
01:52:55,371 --> 01:52:57,620
fact that you're wrestling and
then you add the fact that you're,

2077
01:52:57,621 --> 01:53:01,070
you're moving around and running
after each other and fuck.

2078
01:53:01,380 --> 01:53:05,720
And it's not a good time to be unhealthy.
Yeah, exactly. But sometimes these guys,

2079
01:53:05,721 --> 01:53:06,171
they're,
you know,

2080
01:53:06,171 --> 01:53:09,560
it's a title fight and there's a lot
on the line and like this weekend is a

2081
01:53:09,561 --> 01:53:10,400
perfect example.

2082
01:53:10,401 --> 01:53:13,400
Gray Maynard was supposed to have the
rematch with Frankie Edgar there for third

2083
01:53:13,401 --> 01:53:17,300
fight in the last fight was fucking
incredible. Just an amazing fight.

2084
01:53:17,600 --> 01:53:21,260
The first round gray Maynard knocked
Frankie Edgar down look at least three

2085
01:53:21,261 --> 01:53:23,180
times and he was badly fucking hurt.

2086
01:53:23,181 --> 01:53:26,210
It was crazy how it was
so close to being stopped.

2087
01:53:26,210 --> 01:53:30,680
He was getting fucked up and then he
won the second round and everybody went

2088
01:53:30,681 --> 01:53:35,060
crazy and then it looked like Edgar was
coming on and gray Maynard had blown

2089
01:53:35,061 --> 01:53:38,300
himself out trying to finish them in
the first round and it became a real

2090
01:53:38,301 --> 01:53:42,320
competitive fight and got down to a draw.
And so they're having a rematch.

2091
01:53:42,321 --> 01:53:43,430
It was supposed to be this weekend,

2092
01:53:43,610 --> 01:53:48,080
but gray Maynard or Frankie Edgar rather
broke his ribs or s something happened,

2093
01:53:48,081 --> 01:53:48,621
something happened.

2094
01:53:48,621 --> 01:53:51,710
He had a pullout and they were going
to offer gray Maynard Anthony Pettis.

2095
01:53:51,711 --> 01:53:54,200
But Maynard said, you know what? I've
got to tell you my knees fucked up too.

2096
01:53:54,201 --> 01:53:57,530
I was gonna. I was going to gut through
it just because it a title shot, you know,

2097
01:53:57,590 --> 01:54:00,590
because of the chance to, we've got
some time. So now he decided to step,

2098
01:54:00,710 --> 01:54:04,850
but it just goes to show that he's willing
to fight a fucking title fight with a

2099
01:54:04,850 --> 01:54:08,420
Jack Knee. You know, I mean
there's these guys, they, you know,

2100
01:54:08,421 --> 01:54:11,660
by the time they get through a
six to eight week training camp,

2101
01:54:11,810 --> 01:54:14,690
there's a lot of times they've got
some significant shit wrong with them.

2102
01:54:15,020 --> 01:54:19,550
You know, they're really
shows up in fights, you know,
fucked up knees, fucked up,

2103
01:54:19,551 --> 01:54:21,260
back's fucked up next.

2104
01:54:21,620 --> 01:54:26,270
Like Tiago Silva apparently fucked
as backup so bad that he had to take

2105
01:54:26,271 --> 01:54:28,550
something. I don't know what
the fuck he took, you know,

2106
01:54:28,551 --> 01:54:31,070
some sort of steroid or some
performance enhancing drug.

2107
01:54:31,290 --> 01:54:36,220
And he turned in like non human urine
and they tested his urine and they're

2108
01:54:36,240 --> 01:54:39,080
like, um, this is not
only is it free of drugs,

2109
01:54:39,660 --> 01:54:42,590
it's free of everything that would
make you a person from a Chinchilla.

2110
01:54:44,910 --> 01:54:49,460
You didn't get pregnant. She says you're
a Zombie. You know, but you know, it's,

2111
01:54:49,461 --> 01:54:53,720
it's uh, you know, being close to those
guys and being like, uh, you know,

2112
01:54:53,721 --> 01:54:57,110
on the road with them and going to all
these different towns and getting to see

2113
01:54:57,111 --> 01:55:00,260
them train and getting to see them fight
and getting to see good performances

2114
01:55:00,261 --> 01:55:01,130
and bad performances.

2115
01:55:01,131 --> 01:55:05,570
You're really wrap your head around what
a massive commitment it is to be an MMA

2116
01:55:05,571 --> 01:55:08,720
fighter and how fucking
easiest to be a comic.

2117
01:55:10,140 --> 01:55:13,790
It is. We're very blessed with
a whatever it is that, you know,

2118
01:55:13,820 --> 01:55:18,200
made us decide to do this because it's um,
you know,

2119
01:55:18,320 --> 01:55:20,210
and you can do it till
you die. I mean, people,

2120
01:55:20,211 --> 01:55:23,840
most people are as scared of getting
up and speaking in public as we are of

2121
01:55:23,841 --> 01:55:27,170
getting punched in the face.
I've done both and there's no comparison.

2122
01:55:28,340 --> 01:55:30,560
I was scared before I went on stage.

2123
01:55:30,620 --> 01:55:34,580
I was more scared than I was before
I would fight. Yeah, it's true.

2124
01:55:34,610 --> 01:55:37,520
It's amazing that difference. You
know, because that was only once,

2125
01:55:37,521 --> 01:55:40,520
once I did it and then I realized I was
like okay I was never in those cases

2126
01:55:40,521 --> 01:55:43,480
everyone would fight and everyone will
be a comic if both weren't scary. Yeah,

2127
01:55:43,500 --> 01:55:44,190
they're,
they're definitely

2128
01:55:44,190 --> 01:55:47,940
scary things. But it's just fun. It's
funny to me now like cause cause people,

2129
01:55:48,060 --> 01:55:51,030
I'll be sitting having a drink at the bar
right before I'm supposed to go on and

2130
01:55:51,070 --> 01:55:53,970
nobody would be like are you
nervous or do you have to prepare?

2131
01:55:53,971 --> 01:55:58,380
And it's just like not really. I'm
even drinking and smoking weed outside.

2132
01:55:58,381 --> 01:56:00,600
Like I just go out there and you know,

2133
01:56:00,601 --> 01:56:02,910
I haven't done a show where people
wanted their money back cause I was too

2134
01:56:02,911 --> 01:56:07,500
fucked up. But you know it's,
it's a, it is an easy thing
to do if you know, if you,

2135
01:56:07,501 --> 01:56:10,800
if you do it all the time. Joey Diaz
says it best. He says the hardest,

2136
01:56:10,801 --> 01:56:14,250
easiest thing you'll ever do. Yeah.
And that's really what it is. Once you,

2137
01:56:14,251 --> 01:56:15,000
once you get it,

2138
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:18,060
once you're locked in and if you're
in the groove it's super easy.

2139
01:56:18,420 --> 01:56:22,440
But if you're out of the groove,
like if you go up in a bad state of mind,

2140
01:56:22,441 --> 01:56:25,350
like have you ever had like
a real, like you go, fuck,

2141
01:56:25,351 --> 01:56:28,140
I shouldn't have gone on stage. I
should've, I should've tooken a night off.

2142
01:56:28,200 --> 01:56:32,460
Have you ever had where you were
emotionally kind of in a bad place? Yeah.

2143
01:56:32,480 --> 01:56:33,121
Like you know,

2144
01:56:33,121 --> 01:56:37,260
I maybe a little more prone to snap at
people for being douchey in the audience

2145
01:56:37,261 --> 01:56:40,230
because you know, it just wasn't
in the right, you know, I kind of,

2146
01:56:40,290 --> 01:56:43,050
I'll go into it sometimes a
little negative like, oh, okay,

2147
01:56:43,170 --> 01:56:45,220
I could tell this was going
to be a noisy crowd and the,

2148
01:56:45,221 --> 01:56:48,660
and I'll let it get to me
when I could just, you know,
try to ignore it, you know?

2149
01:56:48,750 --> 01:56:50,010
No, but I'm, what I mean is like,

2150
01:56:50,011 --> 01:56:52,080
have you ever had a where
you're emotionally fucked up,

2151
01:56:52,081 --> 01:56:54,740
you just went up there and
you just couldn't be funny
and just weren't funny and

2152
01:56:54,741 --> 01:56:59,700
just couldn't feel it because I don't know
why you, you're talking about, no, no,

2153
01:56:59,730 --> 01:57:03,390
but I'm ridiculous like that. I can, I
can understand that that happening. Like,

2154
01:57:03,391 --> 01:57:05,250
I certainly,
but it's not you.

2155
01:57:05,450 --> 01:57:08,970
I didn't do standup comedy for
like a week after nine 11. Like I,

2156
01:57:08,971 --> 01:57:11,220
that was a period of time
where like if I went on stage,

2157
01:57:11,221 --> 01:57:15,660
I just feel like it would feel wrong and,
and uncomfortable.

2158
01:57:16,080 --> 01:57:18,930
But fortunately people didn't want comedy,
you know what I mean?

2159
01:57:18,931 --> 01:57:22,170
They waited a little bit. But then
once, once I got back on board,

2160
01:57:22,171 --> 01:57:26,050
it was a great feeling
to make people laugh, uh,

2161
01:57:26,070 --> 01:57:28,620
under those circumstances. You
know, it was like, it was a good,

2162
01:57:28,621 --> 01:57:30,960
it was therapeutic for me
and the audience. Right.

2163
01:57:30,961 --> 01:57:34,510
But you've never had a moment where you
were in a shitty place and you went on

2164
01:57:34,511 --> 01:57:38,250
stage and because of you being in
a shitty place, he just ate it. No,

2165
01:57:38,251 --> 01:57:40,920
I just eat it on my own and
then, and then, you know,

2166
01:57:40,921 --> 01:57:44,160
they'd get mad at them if they don't like
it, but I, I can't really blame it on,

2167
01:57:44,760 --> 01:57:48,300
you know, like I'd imagine that
there's, there's gotta be some sort of,

2168
01:57:48,480 --> 01:57:51,380
are you hinting it?
Have you had an situation that,

2169
01:57:51,381 --> 01:57:53,940
I've had a couple of the best ones
I've ever heard. Those are into,

2170
01:57:53,970 --> 01:57:58,640
something would happen to Ari. Ari
Ari had a girlfriend that uh, he uh,

2171
01:57:58,710 --> 01:58:02,520
was upset that she was hanging out at
the comedy store after they broke up.

2172
01:58:02,730 --> 01:58:05,850
It was really upset how they broke up
and it just, it was, it was hard on him.

2173
01:58:05,851 --> 01:58:09,690
This is a heartbreaker and she was hanging
around the comedy store and he threw

2174
01:58:09,691 --> 01:58:14,580
a glass of ice water on her head and
everybody got mad at them and there was

2175
01:58:14,581 --> 01:58:17,990
like, dude, you know what
the fuck? And then our,

2176
01:58:18,050 --> 01:58:23,050
he tries out for last comic standing and
this girl is one of the judges for last

2177
01:58:23,251 --> 01:58:24,240
comic standing.

2178
01:58:24,241 --> 01:58:28,650
I was wondering if it was her and there's
only three people in when the last

2179
01:58:28,651 --> 01:58:32,740
comic standing judging is really
not stand up comedy really never.

2180
01:58:32,850 --> 01:58:35,730
There's never any other situation where
you have to do standup for three people

2181
01:58:35,731 --> 01:58:38,040
in a room. And if there is, you
should, you should run. Yeah,

2182
01:58:38,100 --> 01:58:42,130
it's gross the way they do it is
gross. I don't agree with it. I think

2183
01:58:42,170 --> 01:58:46,780
it's cruel.
It's cruel bee.

2184
01:58:46,810 --> 01:58:49,390
A little melodramatic. It's weird.
It's weird. It's weird. Weird.

2185
01:58:49,391 --> 01:58:52,860
It doesn't have anything to do with like
becoming a stand up comic and they can,

2186
01:58:53,170 --> 01:58:56,050
or being a good one. The eight K
it's influenced by Simon Powell.

2187
01:58:56,051 --> 01:58:59,680
I was there for last comic standing,
the original, the original series,

2188
01:58:59,681 --> 01:59:03,460
the first season rather I was one of
the judges and when we judge comics,

2189
01:59:03,461 --> 01:59:06,850
they were in front of a crowd and they
got a crowd to perform in front of and we

2190
01:59:06,851 --> 01:59:09,070
voted them in or out
and it was that simple.

2191
01:59:09,250 --> 01:59:12,490
Then somewhere along the line they got
the sort of Simon cowel thing going on

2192
01:59:12,491 --> 01:59:14,130
where they want to see
the shitty additions,

2193
01:59:14,590 --> 01:59:17,260
they want to see the shitty auditions
and they want to interrupt people and be

2194
01:59:17,261 --> 01:59:18,760
funny,
like cutting them off.

2195
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:23,260
And so Aria has no idea that she's one
of the judges and he goes out there and

2196
01:59:23,261 --> 01:59:27,930
just was totally unprepared and didn't
know what and just ate shit and just dry

2197
01:59:27,940 --> 01:59:30,700
brick.
Plonk

2198
01:59:32,380 --> 01:59:36,820
plonk that's the worst one I've
ever heard. My worst one was, uh,

2199
01:59:36,850 --> 01:59:41,850
I was in a gas station on my way to the
comedy store and it was two weeks after

2200
01:59:41,861 --> 01:59:42,850
Phil Hartman had died.

2201
01:59:43,030 --> 01:59:46,420
And I hadn't gotten on stage yet and I
was the first time going on stage back

2202
01:59:47,080 --> 01:59:47,801
and Nope,
no,

2203
01:59:47,801 --> 01:59:50,260
it was the second time I'd gone on
stage the night before and it went okay.

2204
01:59:50,261 --> 01:59:51,970
But it was shaky, you know, but I was,

2205
01:59:51,971 --> 01:59:55,270
I was thrown and I knew that people when
they are introduced me say that he's on

2206
01:59:55,271 --> 01:59:57,910
news radio. I knew the people in
the audience are going to go, oh,

2207
01:59:57,911 --> 02:00:01,030
it was not there where that guy got
murdered by as quite of your top of mind

2208
02:00:01,031 --> 02:00:05,140
problem. And it's why I blew,
blew her brains out and he's
a big fucking story. Um,

2209
02:00:05,200 --> 02:00:09,250
and so I'm on my way to the comedy store
and I pull into the gas station and

2210
02:00:09,251 --> 02:00:14,251
it's dude that I knew from Jujitsu is
a cop and he sees me and we started

2211
02:00:15,061 --> 02:00:20,061
talking and he tells me that he was there
and he tells me that his buddy broke

2212
02:00:21,281 --> 02:00:26,281
into the house because Phil Hartman's
wife had the kids in the bathroom and she

2213
02:00:27,371 --> 02:00:30,790
had a gun and she had already killed
fill and she was going to kill the kids.

2214
02:00:31,180 --> 02:00:33,220
And that's what you know,
that's what a mother does.

2215
02:00:33,221 --> 02:00:35,490
If a mother is going to commit suicide,
a lot of times if they're,

2216
02:00:35,540 --> 02:00:38,590
they're that desperate and they're
that fucked up, they were about to go,

2217
02:00:38,980 --> 02:00:40,630
they're going to kill her kids to it.
They didn't want the kids.

2218
02:00:40,930 --> 02:00:45,280
So the guy kicks down the door because
they know that she's got a gun and the

2219
02:00:45,281 --> 02:00:49,990
kids run away from their mother.
They run from their mother pulling away,

2220
02:00:49,991 --> 02:00:51,940
screaming,
run from their mother.

2221
02:00:52,090 --> 02:00:56,140
They get out of the bathroom and she
blows her fucking brains out. Boom.

2222
02:00:56,320 --> 02:01:00,370
Cops in the house, kids running from
her and she blows her brains out.

2223
02:01:00,820 --> 02:01:05,820
And I went on stage an hour later
and there was no way I can be funny.

2224
02:01:06,280 --> 02:01:10,840
It was impossible. It was impossible.
And I was saying the jokes right,

2225
02:01:11,230 --> 02:01:14,800
I was, I was trying, the words were
coming out in the correct order,

2226
02:01:15,070 --> 02:01:19,450
but there was no way I could be funny.
It was, it was, there was nothing there.

2227
02:01:19,570 --> 02:01:22,360
And I, even at the end of the
show, I said something, I said,

2228
02:01:22,361 --> 02:01:23,740
I'm sorry I shouldn't have got onstage.

2229
02:01:24,130 --> 02:01:27,070
I found out some shit right before I
went on stage and I couldn't not think

2230
02:01:27,071 --> 02:01:30,040
about it when I was up here and I
apologize is terrible side. I'm sorry.

2231
02:01:30,100 --> 02:01:32,980
I'm just bring up the next
guy and hopefully he won't
suck as bad and I brought

2232
02:01:32,981 --> 02:01:36,790
up the next guy and I just fucking
got out of there. Drove home crying.

2233
02:01:37,840 --> 02:01:40,190
That was, that was the
worst. That's intense.

2234
02:01:40,280 --> 02:01:42,620
Yeah. I'd wished that guy wasn't
there at that gas station.

2235
02:01:42,770 --> 02:01:46,940
I really didn't want to know
that. Yeah, yeah. No, that's,
that's way too much. Yeah,

2236
02:01:47,120 --> 02:01:50,570
and I'm not high anymore. Yeah.
That's a buzz kill, right? Wow.

2237
02:01:50,600 --> 02:01:54,260
We'll have to fire back up. Five 21 oh
it's the end of the show. What a downer.

2238
02:01:54,500 --> 02:01:57,830
Should we end on this downer? Do you have
anything happen? Oh, that's pretty heavy.

2239
02:01:58,440 --> 02:02:01,340
Shoot yourself up tonight at sounds.
Comedy Hall or not.

2240
02:02:02,840 --> 02:02:06,530
Maybe we're just going to carry that
thought. I'm going to be in mom tonight.

2241
02:02:06,620 --> 02:02:09,770
I'm going to be sorta near the White House
and somebody is asking me if I wanted

2242
02:02:09,771 --> 02:02:12,860
to do a tour of it. Whoa. And I'm like,

2243
02:02:13,070 --> 02:02:15,560
do they let people use the bathroom
and the White House? I don't know.

2244
02:02:15,561 --> 02:02:18,140
I'd love to take a shoe thing. There's
cameras in the, in the bathroom,

2245
02:02:18,141 --> 02:02:20,210
in the White House.
That'd be weird.

2246
02:02:20,210 --> 02:02:23,040
What do you mean has to be on stage
as I'm trying to stall would get,

2247
02:02:23,130 --> 02:02:25,850
I would imagine there has to be cameras
in the bathroom of the White House.

2248
02:02:26,450 --> 02:02:28,190
Even in like while you're
sitting on the crapper,

2249
02:02:28,191 --> 02:02:30,320
I think there has to be cause you
otherwise you can be, you know,

2250
02:02:30,410 --> 02:02:34,070
you could go in there and take off your
jacket and start putting together a gun

2251
02:02:34,071 --> 02:02:37,250
that you've got pieced of little, little
tiny parts all throughout your jacket.

2252
02:02:37,400 --> 02:02:39,470
You screw it together.
You're went out and ice everybody.

2253
02:02:39,920 --> 02:02:41,820
I think you have to go
through a metal detector day.

2254
02:02:41,850 --> 02:02:44,690
Give you maybe have a plastic gun
first place, maybe a plastic gun.

2255
02:02:44,691 --> 02:02:47,450
Your boat with a man. I have some sort of
special metal. It doesn't get detected.

2256
02:02:47,510 --> 02:02:50,960
Maybe picked my fucking watch doesn't go
off when I go through my wedding ring.

2257
02:02:50,961 --> 02:02:52,700
My watch is this.

2258
02:02:52,850 --> 02:02:56,240
I could make something out of this
watch and fucking cut you open with it.

2259
02:02:56,270 --> 02:02:58,640
This is ridiculous.
It's metal.

2260
02:02:59,010 --> 02:03:02,800
Well it's some metals that works and some
metals that doesn't all the TSA rules

2261
02:03:02,810 --> 02:03:04,820
right.
Drive me crazy cause I just like,

2262
02:03:05,150 --> 02:03:08,450
like you can have lighters in
your checked bag. I mean in your,

2263
02:03:08,540 --> 02:03:11,030
in your carry on but you can't
have lighters in your checked bag,

2264
02:03:11,031 --> 02:03:12,560
which that doesn't make any sense to me.

2265
02:03:13,800 --> 02:03:15,950
I fly with a lot of lighters
cause you know how I am

2266
02:03:18,320 --> 02:03:21,860
either people or giving them to me
like as a present or I'm just actually

2267
02:03:21,861 --> 02:03:23,480
walking away with people,
lighters and I,

2268
02:03:23,481 --> 02:03:27,680
so I always have a bunch of my bag
coming back from Canada, from Toronto.

2269
02:03:28,160 --> 02:03:30,950
They pulled me aside and said you've
got too many lighters and I was like too

2270
02:03:30,951 --> 02:03:32,780
many. And they go, yeah,
you can only have one.

2271
02:03:32,900 --> 02:03:35,240
And so they made me throw
out like four lighters.

2272
02:03:35,241 --> 02:03:37,480
But it was really funny because he's like
you have too many letters and they're

2273
02:03:37,490 --> 02:03:39,590
like yeah there might be a couple in
there. And they were like, here's one,

2274
02:03:39,591 --> 02:03:41,450
here's what they're like
pulling all these liners out.

2275
02:03:41,630 --> 02:03:43,760
And one of them was a Mary Louise Parker.

2276
02:03:43,761 --> 02:03:45,290
It was like a one of those flip lighters,

2277
02:03:45,291 --> 02:03:49,790
you know the a and M had a picture of
Mary Louise Parker looking all sexy from

2278
02:03:49,791 --> 02:03:52,160
weeds on it and then,
and engraved in the back,

2279
02:03:52,161 --> 02:03:54,580
some stuff about you're
such a great stoner when it,

2280
02:03:54,581 --> 02:03:56,840
and the guy stood there in
front of me and read it.

2281
02:03:57,040 --> 02:04:00,710
He read it and then he's like, well,
which one do you want to keep? And I said,

2282
02:04:00,711 --> 02:04:01,670
I'll,
I'll keep that one.

2283
02:04:01,671 --> 02:04:05,600
I'll keep doing what the engraved one
and I threw away for stupid bics or

2284
02:04:05,601 --> 02:04:09,320
whatever. But uh, what, what
does that, what are those,

2285
02:04:09,380 --> 02:04:11,810
why are those rules different
from country to country?

2286
02:04:12,020 --> 02:04:15,700
Like they should just be standards that
are set up and they should, you know,

2287
02:04:15,930 --> 02:04:18,740
make some sort of sense because Hannah
has got a lot of interesting rules.

2288
02:04:18,950 --> 02:04:23,540
You can't even get in there if you have
a Dui. Really when they run your Id,

2289
02:04:23,541 --> 02:04:26,830
if you have a Dui, they say you can't
come into the country. Sorry, Douche bag.

2290
02:04:26,870 --> 02:04:29,000
That's not a bad idea.
It's great idea.

2291
02:04:29,001 --> 02:04:32,300
It's one of the reasons why Canada is so
fucking cool. I had no idea though that,

2292
02:04:32,420 --> 02:04:34,160
I mean I don't have a Dui but uh,

2293
02:04:34,161 --> 02:04:36,500
if I had one I would have
still tried to go to Canada.

2294
02:04:36,520 --> 02:04:39,540
Like you don't find out to get
there. Right. Yeah. Thank you.

2295
02:04:39,541 --> 02:04:41,220
Can make your reservations and stuff.

2296
02:04:41,250 --> 02:04:44,550
We'll even if you get off of something
sometimes it shows up on your record.

2297
02:04:44,550 --> 02:04:49,260
Eddie Bravo had a gun charge cause he
got pulled over once and he was legally

2298
02:04:49,261 --> 02:04:52,260
carrying a gun cause he worked for
a check cashing company and uh,

2299
02:04:52,350 --> 02:04:55,400
he told the cop, you know,
you have to tell a cop, a cop
pulls you over. I'm sorry.

2300
02:04:55,420 --> 02:04:57,900
Just tell you officer, I have a
loaded gun. So they handcuff him,

2301
02:04:57,901 --> 02:05:01,140
throwing the back of the car. They run
his plate, they run the whole thing. Okay.

2302
02:05:01,141 --> 02:05:03,850
You're legally carrying his
gun, go back to work, take care.

2303
02:05:04,020 --> 02:05:07,830
But that just the fact that he was
arrested shows up and every time we go to

2304
02:05:07,831 --> 02:05:09,480
Canada I said get away from me dude.

2305
02:05:09,630 --> 02:05:11,940
You go up there on your own
because if I get stuck with them,

2306
02:05:11,941 --> 02:05:15,990
I'm stuck for fucking hours. Man. Stuck
for an hour and a half, two hours.

2307
02:05:16,260 --> 02:05:19,170
We tried to drive across the
border with Tommy Chong runs

2308
02:05:22,470 --> 02:05:27,020
from uh, from Seattle into
Vancouver and they just, you know,

2309
02:05:27,021 --> 02:05:31,310
they searched the car within an
injured dog. That car got so raped.

2310
02:05:33,500 --> 02:05:35,360
It was a,
it was a long stretch limo too.

2311
02:05:35,361 --> 02:05:38,390
So it was kind of embarrassing like how
many you seats and stuff they had to

2312
02:05:38,391 --> 02:05:41,090
pull out, but they were super
friendly to him the whole time.

2313
02:05:41,091 --> 02:05:43,970
Never searched any of our bodies like a,
you know,

2314
02:05:43,971 --> 02:05:46,850
we've realized after we left
that to one of my friends,

2315
02:05:46,851 --> 02:05:51,400
Tony had a joint in his
pocket the entire time until,

2316
02:05:51,440 --> 02:05:55,030
wow. Those kinds of moments
are just like he would,

2317
02:05:55,080 --> 02:05:57,470
if he didn't know he had it on him,
he wouldn't have been able to pull it off.

2318
02:05:57,500 --> 02:06:00,410
Yeah, right. He just said he just
thought he didn't have any weed on him,

2319
02:06:00,411 --> 02:06:02,660
so they were like, get out of
the car or come stand over here.

2320
02:06:02,661 --> 02:06:04,670
And we're just saying, we just
stood around and they'd, you know,

2321
02:06:04,671 --> 02:06:07,190
they ran all of our
passports and so again,

2322
02:06:07,310 --> 02:06:09,540
lucky I didn't have a DUI
and that's how much that we,

2323
02:06:09,630 --> 02:06:14,450
that guy smokes kind of like unknown
joints and get out of his body.

2324
02:06:15,330 --> 02:06:16,410
Let me what my book bag I,

2325
02:06:16,411 --> 02:06:20,100
I traveled last time I traveled I had
a bowl and weed in it from Portland

2326
02:06:20,101 --> 02:06:23,120
because so many fucking people
gave us weed and it Joey d is,

2327
02:06:23,121 --> 02:06:26,220
is putting weed in my book bag.
Everyone who's given me weed and

2328
02:06:26,510 --> 02:06:30,240
you that at the airport and got a search
your shit for weed before you fly. Yeah.

2329
02:06:30,241 --> 02:06:32,250
Don't be putting weed
in your luggage ever.

2330
02:06:32,670 --> 02:06:36,360
You're not going to find weed my luggage
to go ahead and look a little bit.

2331
02:06:37,980 --> 02:06:41,250
I'm just saying just because it's my
understanding that it fits in your checked

2332
02:06:41,251 --> 02:06:45,240
bag. Like if you put it in a sock
or something that uh, you know,

2333
02:06:45,960 --> 02:06:49,170
the worst is going to happen is the guy
who finds it just takes it for himself.

2334
02:06:49,380 --> 02:06:52,920
Really. I wouldn't try that shit
going to Canada. No, no, no, no.

2335
02:06:52,921 --> 02:06:56,700
Not Out of the country. I'm talking
domestic. I still wouldn't try that shit.

2336
02:06:57,210 --> 02:06:59,910
It's not worth it. No, it's, it's
smart not to and you're beautiful.

2337
02:06:59,911 --> 02:07:00,920
You're lucky like me.

2338
02:07:00,921 --> 02:07:05,100
You go somewhere and make one phone call
or something or write one tweet and the

2339
02:07:05,101 --> 02:07:06,390
find out where the weeds at.
Yeah.

2340
02:07:06,391 --> 02:07:10,290
You find out where the cops are at
third tweet and hey man, come meet me.

2341
02:07:10,291 --> 02:07:12,960
My Burger King cops so don't care.

2342
02:07:12,961 --> 02:07:17,300
There's no sting operations for existing
operations for high school, Bro.

2343
02:07:18,800 --> 02:07:21,840
Like us. Don't. They don't ever harass
us is what I'm saying. That's true.

2344
02:07:21,841 --> 02:07:25,500
But how many dudes in high school were
gone, Bro? You're fucking paranoid.

2345
02:07:25,501 --> 02:07:29,550
These people are not undercover
cops. Meanwhile, they were,

2346
02:07:29,700 --> 02:07:31,550
could you imagine they were
getting high and they go, dude,

2347
02:07:31,560 --> 02:07:35,070
I think Billy's an undercover cop.
Get the fuck Outta here man.

2348
02:07:35,170 --> 02:07:40,140
No undercover cops. This is high school
in Florida. Nobody gives a fuck man too.

2349
02:07:40,150 --> 02:07:44,140
I'm telling you for 40 year olds just
transferred into our school and it turns

2350
02:07:44,141 --> 02:07:45,810
out they all really need weeds.

2351
02:07:45,811 --> 02:07:47,890
How we're going to help
them out because you know,

2352
02:07:47,891 --> 02:07:51,610
it's hard to be 40 and in high school and
need weed. Yeah. Meanwhile, by the way,

2353
02:07:51,611 --> 02:07:54,520
Florida is like the number one
pill place in the whole country.

2354
02:07:54,521 --> 02:07:56,020
It's the easiest place to get pills.

2355
02:07:56,140 --> 02:07:58,570
We've talked about it before and
we'll bring it up again for it.

2356
02:07:58,571 --> 02:07:59,650
It doesn't have a database.

2357
02:07:59,890 --> 02:08:03,160
You can get oxycontin's all over the
place in Florida because you can get a

2358
02:08:03,161 --> 02:08:06,020
prescription and it didn't go down
the street to another doctor and say,

2359
02:08:06,021 --> 02:08:06,581
my back hurts.

2360
02:08:06,581 --> 02:08:08,680
And he writes you another prescription
and you go to another doctor.

2361
02:08:08,830 --> 02:08:11,530
You can keep doing it all over Florida.
People do it all the time.

2362
02:08:11,710 --> 02:08:15,610
There was a vanguard show and
episode of, uh, uh, called, um,

2363
02:08:15,820 --> 02:08:19,360
the oxycontin express all about, you
can find it online if you're interested.

2364
02:08:19,361 --> 02:08:23,490
Just, just Google the oxycontin
express and it's all about the law.

2365
02:08:23,500 --> 02:08:26,170
The hard words to spell and
you're telling me boxy content.

2366
02:08:26,380 --> 02:08:28,660
We'll just throw it in Google.
It will say, did you mean this?

2367
02:08:28,661 --> 02:08:32,440
And it'll clear you up. But uh,
yeah, man, pills are a lot more,

2368
02:08:32,740 --> 02:08:33,750
more fucking now.

2369
02:08:33,751 --> 02:08:37,630
I kept one commercial that the drug free
America did where they showed like the

2370
02:08:37,631 --> 02:08:40,180
dealer on the corner talking
about will you should,

2371
02:08:40,181 --> 02:08:43,060
you know you should keep your kids away
from the medicine cabinet before you

2372
02:08:43,061 --> 02:08:47,080
keep him away from me. Like that should
be a bigger concern. Yeah, no shit.

2373
02:08:47,081 --> 02:08:49,630
Cause it's right there under their
noses and you're gone all the time.

2374
02:08:51,700 --> 02:08:52,900
I'm getting, you know, he's like,

2375
02:08:52,901 --> 02:08:57,010
I'm not going to be out of business
because of drug medicine cabinets. I wish,

2376
02:08:57,430 --> 02:08:58,990
I wish we could get
through the doctor drew

2377
02:09:00,710 --> 02:09:03,400
that if Dr Jay was talking about this
kind of, if he's taught, call him up.

2378
02:09:03,440 --> 02:09:04,273
I was talking about,

2379
02:09:05,290 --> 02:09:10,290
but this is going after narcs that are
arresting high school kids for we'd look,

2380
02:09:11,981 --> 02:09:14,080
I don't know why he thinks
that's a good idea. First of all,

2381
02:09:14,320 --> 02:09:17,200
when you're a high school kid, yeah,
you're going to make shitty choices.

2382
02:09:17,201 --> 02:09:18,310
You're gonna make bad decisions.

2383
02:09:18,311 --> 02:09:20,890
You're in high school and if
you're selling going to try stuff,

2384
02:09:21,310 --> 02:09:23,770
you're supposed to take the wheat
away from the kid and go stop.

2385
02:09:23,950 --> 02:09:28,300
You're not supposed to have undercover
cops pretending to be students wandering

2386
02:09:28,301 --> 02:09:30,520
the halls trying to buy weed.
They should be.

2387
02:09:30,521 --> 02:09:33,760
And they should be trying to stop
adults from selling stuff like that to

2388
02:09:33,761 --> 02:09:36,500
children. That's what they should, that's
what they undercover thing should be,

2389
02:09:36,501 --> 02:09:39,940
is they should pretend to be dealers and
get involved with those other dealers.

2390
02:09:39,941 --> 02:09:44,680
And, and that's, yeah, it's a minor
them out. Weeds, a minor issue folks.

2391
02:09:44,710 --> 02:09:49,710
The real issue is pills and heroin and
meth and all that creepy shit that ruins

2392
02:09:50,111 --> 02:09:54,280
limes. Weed's not ruined your life.
It's just not, I don't buy it.

2393
02:09:54,340 --> 02:09:58,300
I didn't even start until I was in my
late twenties. I was 30, 30 years old,

2394
02:09:58,301 --> 02:10:01,270
almost 31. Yeah. And I never, when
I was a kid, I never was loud.

2395
02:10:01,271 --> 02:10:03,910
I was like a big fan of Cheech and
Chong, you know, had their albums,

2396
02:10:03,911 --> 02:10:07,160
listen to them and never even thought
to try it. It just seemed like, oh,

2397
02:10:07,161 --> 02:10:10,720
it's fun laughing about this. Uh, you
know, he's crazy. He had dug adult.

2398
02:10:10,721 --> 02:10:15,460
What got you to take her other
comics really sane improves. Really.

2399
02:10:16,030 --> 02:10:19,780
So did they like talk you into it or
did they say did you want to try it?

2400
02:10:19,781 --> 02:10:22,600
They're just like lets smoke, smoke
some pot. And they were both into it.

2401
02:10:22,601 --> 02:10:23,860
So I was like I'll give it a,
you know,

2402
02:10:23,890 --> 02:10:26,480
I'll give it another world because I
was one of those same thing happened to

2403
02:10:26,481 --> 02:10:31,120
Willie Nelson supposedly where like
the first time I tried it once in high

2404
02:10:31,121 --> 02:10:34,040
school I was like one of those
people have walked around and going,

2405
02:10:34,041 --> 02:10:36,350
oh it didn't do anything, you
know, didn't do anything for me.

2406
02:10:36,351 --> 02:10:39,500
So you know with Shitty weed or
I didn't already has a friend.

2407
02:10:39,501 --> 02:10:41,450
We're legitimately doesn't work.
Yeah.

2408
02:10:41,510 --> 02:10:45,140
I've seen him smoke crazy amounts of
weed and nothing happens or it doesn't do

2409
02:10:45,141 --> 02:10:48,860
anything. Yeah. But Michael Michael,
Ian Black is like that. Really? Yeah.

2410
02:10:48,861 --> 02:10:51,020
Cause he said I really want to
get high, get me high. And I was,

2411
02:10:51,021 --> 02:10:55,140
we were in Seattle so I had good weed
and I watched him smoke a ton of it and

2412
02:10:55,141 --> 02:10:56,510
then he was just like, no, nothing.

2413
02:10:56,930 --> 02:10:59,150
You haven't tried to use it
because it's a bit like, you know,

2414
02:10:59,151 --> 02:11:03,350
you're pretending that you're
not high. And, uh, I don't
know if he's done edibles.

2415
02:11:03,351 --> 02:11:06,380
I don't know if he's tried that.
I'll ask him sometime. But he, yeah,

2416
02:11:06,381 --> 02:11:09,950
he's kind of like just a, he's just
built a certain way that he doesn't,

2417
02:11:10,100 --> 02:11:10,933
it doesn't affect him.

2418
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:15,860
So did you go right from being a guy who
never smoked weed to just fucking full

2419
02:11:15,861 --> 02:11:18,830
on stoner? I was know as Moochy
Moochy admin for a long time.

2420
02:11:18,831 --> 02:11:22,040
Like I only smoked when it was
around, you know what I mean? Like I,

2421
02:11:22,041 --> 02:11:25,490
and I hung around a lot of comics,
so they hooked me up a lot, you know?

2422
02:11:25,490 --> 02:11:29,930
And I think that at a certain point I
started to think, oh, I should contribute,

2423
02:11:30,230 --> 02:11:34,220
you know, because this is just rude
and I'm smoking more, you know,

2424
02:11:34,221 --> 02:11:38,660
I want my own and I want to be able
to share and, and so then I, you know,

2425
02:11:38,661 --> 02:11:41,540
but I think when did you first ramped up?
Pretty quickly?

2426
02:11:41,541 --> 02:11:43,770
I think just because of being on
the road all the time. You know,

2427
02:11:43,790 --> 02:11:47,150
this was when I was like a feature act.
So what year is this we're talking about?

2428
02:11:48,530 --> 02:11:50,430
I have no idea.
I could

2429
02:11:52,970 --> 02:11:55,130
trying to get at was La,
was it,

2430
02:11:55,131 --> 02:11:58,220
you'd have to buy pot from dealers or
are you going through the medical system?

2431
02:11:58,250 --> 02:12:02,090
No, I had dealers it medical system. He
hadn't started yet. And then once it did,

2432
02:12:02,091 --> 02:12:03,440
it took me years to catch on.

2433
02:12:03,441 --> 02:12:06,510
Like I didn't get involved in
the medical system until, uh,

2434
02:12:06,680 --> 02:12:09,110
making super high me really,
because I always,

2435
02:12:09,140 --> 02:12:11,120
I always had good dealers that were like,
you know,

2436
02:12:11,121 --> 02:12:13,340
I had this one guy that would
just drive it right to my house.

2437
02:12:13,340 --> 02:12:14,870
You'd always just get whatever you get.

2438
02:12:14,871 --> 02:12:18,440
Like he just give you an eighth of
something awesome. But, uh, you know,

2439
02:12:18,441 --> 02:12:22,490
and it was pricey, but I was working, you
know, it was working and could afford it.

2440
02:12:22,491 --> 02:12:26,300
And so it was never really, like, for
the first few years of medical marijuana,

2441
02:12:26,630 --> 02:12:30,650
I knew some people that were like, oh,
you gotta do it. It's amazing. But like,

2442
02:12:30,651 --> 02:12:33,470
until you step into one of those
places you really don't get.

2443
02:12:33,830 --> 02:12:37,460
And that's part of what I love to show in
that in the movie Super Jaime, is that,

2444
02:12:37,910 --> 02:12:41,390
you know, people in other states are
just blown away that, that, that,

2445
02:12:41,391 --> 02:12:43,850
that exists and that you just
go in there and shop for.

2446
02:12:43,851 --> 02:12:48,530
We'd like that in such a
relaxed environment. I know,
it's amazing. And um, yeah,

2447
02:12:48,531 --> 02:12:53,420
so, um, but once I got
into the medical thing,

2448
02:12:53,421 --> 02:12:56,540
now I'm really into that. But, but
prior to that I just had a, you know,

2449
02:12:56,870 --> 02:13:00,870
different dealers, you know, one that got
robbed and kind of hurt one time that,

2450
02:13:00,871 --> 02:13:04,100
that kind of sucked, you know, like
really? Yeah. I mean I definitely,

2451
02:13:04,390 --> 02:13:07,610
once I figured out about medical, I
was happy to make the leap, you know,

2452
02:13:07,611 --> 02:13:09,500
because I think people that
are dealing or just like,

2453
02:13:09,501 --> 02:13:11,160
they're taking too many
risks, you know? That's,

2454
02:13:11,240 --> 02:13:16,040
that's my leading thing about legalizing
marijuana is just the incarceration of

2455
02:13:16,041 --> 02:13:19,130
people that have anything to do with
it. You know? That's, that's like,

2456
02:13:19,131 --> 02:13:22,730
that's where I think that's the main
thing I'd like to see happen first because

2457
02:13:22,731 --> 02:13:26,590
with medical marijuana and Arnold
Schwarzenegger and making it a like a

2458
02:13:26,840 --> 02:13:29,900
misdemeanor citation, a bull offense, uh,

2459
02:13:29,901 --> 02:13:32,040
I'm not too worried
about getting to smoke.

2460
02:13:32,070 --> 02:13:34,950
I don't really need it to be
legal for my own personal sake.

2461
02:13:35,010 --> 02:13:37,530
I want it to be legal for the,
you know, the black guy that get,

2462
02:13:37,531 --> 02:13:40,400
gets pulled over and has some in
his pocket. Right, right. Yeah.

2463
02:13:40,470 --> 02:13:42,940
Well it is decriminalized
now in this state. Yeah.

2464
02:13:43,060 --> 02:13:45,600
And now the gym is like a hundred
dollar ticket or something. Yeah.

2465
02:13:45,870 --> 02:13:50,160
If the bigger ticket, if you
smoke a cigarette, really Burbank,

2466
02:13:50,190 --> 02:13:53,280
it's a suburb and it's like a two
or 300 Burbank is above the law.

2467
02:13:53,960 --> 02:13:55,950
Burbank's robots do it.
A lot of crazy stuff.

2468
02:13:56,260 --> 02:13:59,400
Why show Sunday at flappers
at four 20. Oh, that's right.

2469
02:13:59,970 --> 02:14:03,060
Let's wrap it up with that. That Joe Rogan
might might appear. I'm going to try,

2470
02:14:03,061 --> 02:14:06,120
I'm going to try to make it, cause
I think I land that morning. Um,

2471
02:14:06,180 --> 02:14:08,460
I'm pretty sure. All Right
Ladies and gentlemen, that's it.

2472
02:14:08,461 --> 02:14:11,930
That's the on the podcast tonight,
we are going to be at Sal's comedy whole.

2473
02:14:11,930 --> 02:14:14,340
Did you get this? If you're in
la, go to sales comedy whole dot.

2474
02:14:14,341 --> 02:14:17,220
Come and work your way through
that shit hole of a website.

2475
02:14:17,450 --> 02:14:21,150
So you find the reservation page and
click on some link and I think you can

2476
02:14:21,151 --> 02:14:23,700
enter in a credit card or something
that went there at eight o'clock.

2477
02:14:24,070 --> 02:14:28,990
It's small place, but it'd be Doug
Benson, Sam Tripoli, Thompson, Gora.

2478
02:14:29,230 --> 02:14:30,510
Um,
this weekend,

2479
02:14:30,540 --> 02:14:35,490
Sam triply and Thompson Gora and me are
at Cobbs and that's three headliners,

2480
02:14:35,491 --> 02:14:38,540
man and Salmon, Sam. And I'm a Thompson.

2481
02:14:38,541 --> 02:14:40,710
We're at both fucking hilarious
if you never seen them before.

2482
02:14:40,711 --> 02:14:43,170
So it should be a killer show,
like four and a half headliners.

2483
02:14:43,171 --> 02:14:47,370
I think I liked the way you think.
Um, the Saturday night is sold out.

2484
02:14:47,371 --> 02:14:49,740
I think there's just a couple of tickets
left Friday and a couple of tickets

2485
02:14:49,741 --> 02:14:52,830
left Thursday as, as far as the
beginning of this podcast, uh,

2486
02:14:53,240 --> 02:14:57,930
it might all be sold out. We'll see you
guys there. And, um, uh, next week, uh,

2487
02:14:57,931 --> 02:15:01,020
I'm going to be doing a
movie, so no podcast. And, uh,

2488
02:15:01,080 --> 02:15:04,890
so I'm going to try to get some people
from the movie and on the podcast I'll

2489
02:15:04,891 --> 02:15:07,470
try to interview them and Bas Rutten's
going to be there and maybe interview him

2490
02:15:07,471 --> 02:15:10,440
again too. But, uh, I'm gonna do
my best to get you guys some shit,

2491
02:15:10,441 --> 02:15:12,360
but there won't be any Ustream ones.
So that's it.

2492
02:15:12,361 --> 02:15:16,700
And we go a live on serious May 28th. So
a, that's it. All right. It's working.

2493
02:15:16,710 --> 02:15:18,760
Show's over. I love you bitches. Sure.

2494
02:15:29,980 --> 02:15:30,040
Okay.
