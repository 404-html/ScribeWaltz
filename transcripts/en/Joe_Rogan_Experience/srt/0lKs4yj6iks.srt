1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,710
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:02,371
Oh,

3
00:00:02,371 --> 00:00:04,380
I screen capture all that time all day.

4
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,630
There really should be
sexual service industry.

5
00:00:06,631 --> 00:00:07,560
There really should be,

6
00:00:07,561 --> 00:00:07,801
you know,

7
00:00:07,801 --> 00:00:09,180
the idea that that's illegal.

8
00:00:09,181 --> 00:00:10,530
It's so fucking gross.

9
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:11,040
You know,

10
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,040
I think it probably causes more rape
causes more anger if prostitution.

11
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:17,280
Yeah.

12
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,530
I don't want my daughter to
be a prostitute of course.

13
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:21,270
But if prostitution was legal,

14
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:23,310
so people are going to
do it and guess what?

15
00:00:23,311 --> 00:00:26,250
Some people are going to actually like
to do it and some people get to enjoy

16
00:00:26,251 --> 00:00:28,080
going there and some people,

17
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:31,110
they're just crazy bitches and they
really wouldn't do anything else anyway.

18
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:31,530
Right.

19
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:32,011
And what are you gonna do?

20
00:00:32,011 --> 00:00:33,060
Are Going gonna fix the whole world.

21
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,910
You're going to fix the whole world or
are you gonna let them get tested and get

22
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:39,450
taxed and let them be treated
like they're not some outlaw,

23
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:39,841
you know,

24
00:00:39,841 --> 00:00:40,501
it's not an,

25
00:00:40,501 --> 00:00:40,730
it's,

26
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:42,030
it's an outlaw thing.

27
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,740
If you're a prostitute,

28
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,790
Europe criminal,

29
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:46,950
if you're giving away sex for free,

30
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:47,910
you're just a whore.

31
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,680
But if you're actually
getting money for it,

32
00:00:49,681 --> 00:00:50,790
you go to jail,

33
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:52,230
they lock you in a cage.

34
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:57,150
And the idea that we still have that in
2011 regardless of what your beliefs are

35
00:00:57,151 --> 00:00:57,631
about sex,

36
00:00:57,631 --> 00:00:59,310
whether you should or
shouldn't go to a prostitute.

37
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,140
I agree that it's kind of a weird thing.

38
00:01:01,141 --> 00:01:02,460
It's a little dehumanizing.

39
00:01:02,461 --> 00:01:03,330
The whole conditions.

40
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,081
It's very strange,

41
00:01:04,081 --> 00:01:06,090
but fucking for sure it should be legal.

42
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:08,670
You just can't lock people in a jail.

43
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,240
You lock people in a cage for making
someone feel good with their mouth.

44
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:14,130
What the fuck is wrong with you?

45
00:01:14,131 --> 00:01:14,940
It's insanity.

46
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:17,030
It's absolute fucking in Santa.

47
00:01:17,031 --> 00:01:20,910
Can Lunacy man complete in Santa Ana
and the fact that it's not challenged,

48
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:25,120
the fact that that's not
challenged in 2011 like,

49
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,950
and the fact that Apple's
not censoring it off as Siri,

50
00:01:27,951 --> 00:01:30,350
when you're asking for a blow job
and they tell you what they look,

51
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,240
the closest escort agency is.

52
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:33,920
Did you know that this is what he did?

53
00:01:33,921 --> 00:01:34,880
He asked it.

54
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:35,460
He was asking,

55
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:35,620
Oh,

56
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:38,030
I haven't told you this last night.

57
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:39,890
I just sit there in
bed and try new things,

58
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:40,280
you know,

59
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:40,971
and I'm sitting there,

60
00:01:40,971 --> 00:01:41,330
he'll go,

61
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:41,700
I need,

62
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,620
I want a blow job.

63
00:01:42,621 --> 00:01:42,981
And they're like,

64
00:01:42,981 --> 00:01:47,150
we found Ford escort agencies closest
to you and it was like 27 miles away.

65
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:47,481
You know,

66
00:01:47,481 --> 00:01:49,960
Steve Jobs is program some shit in there.

67
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:50,500
That's it.

68
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,730
Just waiting for someone
to say the right thing.

69
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,170
I just hope they don't
start censoring it though.

70
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,850
Apples keep on going that way.

71
00:01:55,851 --> 00:01:56,930
Make it like the Internet.

72
00:01:56,931 --> 00:01:57,860
Don't start censoring it.

73
00:01:57,861 --> 00:02:01,610
That's fucking cool that you
actually have that in their portal.

74
00:02:01,611 --> 00:02:02,444
Siri.

75
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,670
He just put it in there
knowing eventually.

76
00:02:05,671 --> 00:02:05,990
Right.

77
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:06,350
Okay.

78
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:10,090
What is exactly going to
happen on December 21st,

79
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:10,240
2012

80
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,640
cannot access future node.

81
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,303
That's fine.

82
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:15,581
Yeah.

83
00:02:15,581 --> 00:02:16,700
That's fucking cool man.

84
00:02:16,701 --> 00:02:18,220
But one thing that seems interesting,

85
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:21,880
it seems like that it's a run
off a server because it's been,

86
00:02:21,881 --> 00:02:22,091
you know,

87
00:02:22,091 --> 00:02:24,400
everyone's activating the Siri,

88
00:02:24,401 --> 00:02:27,640
which is a remote assistant on the new
iPhone four s is what we're talking

89
00:02:27,641 --> 00:02:27,840
about.

90
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,040
Well you know what it's based on,

91
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:29,874
right?

92
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,713
Uh,

93
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,550
the dragon or no,

94
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,080
based on Wolfram Alpha,

95
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,490
which was that search engine,

96
00:02:35,491 --> 00:02:38,670
it was created by all
these PhDs they wanted,

97
00:02:38,671 --> 00:02:42,600
they literally wanted to put together
the concept is a website that can answer

98
00:02:42,601 --> 00:02:43,434
any question.

99
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,030
So no matter what your question is,

100
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:45,690
you know where I'm going.

101
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:50,150
What is the weight of one pound of
nuclear waste it before I've used it for

102
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:50,840
shipping.

103
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,380
Yeah.

104
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,140
Awesome.

105
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:52,351
Yeah,

106
00:02:52,351 --> 00:02:53,520
so apparently that's what,

107
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,360
that's what,

108
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,320
what's behind all that?

109
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:56,770
That's really cool.

110
00:02:56,771 --> 00:02:57,460
It's amazing.

111
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:57,640
Yeah.

112
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,930
When you ask for a dead body,

113
00:02:58,931 --> 00:02:59,800
it a sewer,

114
00:02:59,801 --> 00:03:00,820
an old warehouse.

115
00:03:00,821 --> 00:03:01,700
A junkyard,

116
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,490
where to put a dead body.

117
00:03:03,491 --> 00:03:03,791
Yeah.

118
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:04,840
You didn't make that.

119
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:05,890
I thought this is a fake.

120
00:03:05,891 --> 00:03:06,101
No,

121
00:03:06,101 --> 00:03:06,250
no,

122
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:06,401
no,

123
00:03:06,401 --> 00:03:06,541
no,

124
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:06,940
no,

125
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:07,480
no.

126
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,180
I've been laying in bed and using
it just like fucking making up shit.

127
00:03:11,181 --> 00:03:13,570
Holy Shit device.

128
00:03:13,571 --> 00:03:15,940
If you ever have a gadget and
want to learn everything about it.

129
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:17,900
I just bought Brian One too,

130
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,190
right?

131
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,440
Then I say,

132
00:03:20,441 --> 00:03:21,490
where are we at now?

133
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:21,941
And he's like,

134
00:03:21,941 --> 00:03:22,271
dude,

135
00:03:22,271 --> 00:03:25,000
this is what I just found out and he'll
find shit on it that you would never

136
00:03:25,001 --> 00:03:25,781
figure it out yourself.

137
00:03:25,781 --> 00:03:26,680
Fucking know.

138
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:26,950
Yeah.

139
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,420
Well he's just a gadget whore.

140
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:29,730
I need to figure it out.

141
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:34,270
Take you with them and I think it's
run off a server like I think like that

142
00:03:34,271 --> 00:03:37,720
they're going to be able to
constantly upgrade it as time goes on.

143
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:40,390
And I'm just worried now that
with all the attention to all the,

144
00:03:40,391 --> 00:03:43,150
of course the x rated stuff that
they're going to start censoring.

145
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,730
It went and I hope they
don't start doing that and,

146
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,001
but,

147
00:03:46,001 --> 00:03:48,940
but it is cool to think like what
Siri in five years is going to be,

148
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:52,270
just like when we first saw the
iPhone one to see how it's changed the

149
00:03:52,271 --> 00:03:54,830
technology from then it's
going to be pretty much a PR,

150
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,740
like most relationships without sex,

151
00:03:56,741 --> 00:03:57,700
it's going to be better than that.

152
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:58,031
You know,

153
00:03:58,031 --> 00:03:58,241
it's,

154
00:03:58,241 --> 00:03:58,541
it's,

155
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:00,760
it's going to be anything
you want to talk about,

156
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,770
any questions you have
to ask and you're going,

157
00:04:02,771 --> 00:04:03,640
it's going to learn,

158
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:05,020
it's going to get to know you.

159
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:05,291
It's,

160
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:05,561
you know,

161
00:04:05,561 --> 00:04:08,530
it's pretty much going to be
like artificial intelligence.

162
00:04:08,531 --> 00:04:10,630
I think that is those relationships,

163
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,640
that sex because what else is that?

164
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,560
You're sitting there
talking to a computer.

165
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:15,873
Most of them.

166
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:16,590
Oh,

167
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,940
like most like a relationship without sex.

168
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:19,360
You know,

169
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:19,751
know what,

170
00:04:19,751 --> 00:04:21,070
you won't feel the same.

171
00:04:21,071 --> 00:04:21,904
That's what the,

172
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:25,570
if you know that the robot is there
for you because it's artificial,

173
00:04:25,571 --> 00:04:26,500
you're going to abuse it.

174
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,810
It's not like a person that
you love to have around.

175
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,230
I think most people would probably
just beat the fuck out of the robots.

176
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,130
Right.

177
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:38,130
I knew that the robot wasn't a person
but was always going to like look out for

178
00:04:38,141 --> 00:04:41,590
them and be there for them and then you
would find that role but ignoring and

179
00:04:41,591 --> 00:04:44,250
you would kick his ass cause you know he
couldn't fight back cause it's a bit of

180
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,340
a protective right.

181
00:04:45,341 --> 00:04:47,230
But if it gets to know you better and me,

182
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:47,991
I'm already late.

183
00:04:47,991 --> 00:04:48,431
Oh man,

184
00:04:48,431 --> 00:04:49,160
it's a robot.

185
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,960
But if it gets to know what your answers
would be in your personality better

186
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,910
cause I'm already interested in it and
it's just not even smart right now.

187
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:00,790
But what if it starts to get to know
you and now you're so interested in it,

188
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:04,240
like crack you want to asking what
if you fall in love with your phone?

189
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:04,950
Yeah,

190
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:05,360
she's,

191
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,193
she has things,

192
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,100
I even asked it to sing the other
day and it starts singing me a song.

193
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:09,491
I mean,

194
00:05:09,491 --> 00:05:10,540
it's pretty much,

195
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:10,970
it's,

196
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:12,160
it has,

197
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,360
it's fascinating.

198
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,140
Like I wanted to,

199
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,040
I'm addicted to it.

200
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:15,933
I'm addicted to,

201
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:18,250
Brian just got a cursed iPhone.

202
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:19,150
It's not Siri.

203
00:05:19,151 --> 00:05:20,320
It's got a demon in it.

204
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:25,810
Okay.
