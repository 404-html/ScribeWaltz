1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,990
The joe rogan experience.
I just didn't even think that was going

2
00:00:02,991 --> 00:00:05,180
to be a big deal.
I just think that's comics.

3
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:08,030
I think that I'm used to sitting around
with those guys at the cellar,

4
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:10,950
you know,
it's,

5
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:16,060
it's how we communicate.
Like I can't tell you where half of

6
00:00:16,461 --> 00:00:18,230
these guys who were my best friends grew
up,

7
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:21,140
but I,
I'm ready with so many insults for them.

8
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,260
If one of the mocks back wearing a
stupid jacket,

9
00:00:24,261 --> 00:00:27,260
I can't wait,
can't wait.

10
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:30,130
Norton is awesome.
God,

11
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:33,500
Oh,
Norton has crushed me so many times.

12
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:38,880
Talked about this funny story.
He had a slice of pizza and Louis Ck som

13
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:42,800
on the street and just slapped a slice
of pizza to the ground

14
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:48,920
just for no reason.
And he starts to laugh and when he's

15
00:00:48,921 --> 00:00:50,390
telling the story and he's like,
oh,

16
00:00:50,391 --> 00:00:52,640
I was a juicy pizza pizza too.
It was a nice one.

17
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,670
You can do that to another person that
they wouldn't appreciate it.

18
00:00:58,820 --> 00:00:59,840
The humor in the

19
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:02,010
appropriateness.
So happy.

20
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:04,160
The other night we were just playing
Keith Robinson.

21
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,820
When he got eliminated from star search,
we were playing it over and over again

22
00:01:07,821 --> 00:01:09,200
in front of him.
By the way,

23
00:01:09,201 --> 00:01:11,330
don't,
don't think that you can come to Amy

24
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:14,690
Schumer and slap her fucking pizza down.
That's not what we're saying.

25
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:17,010
You have to be a comedian.
You can get a friend,

26
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,320
a good friend,
but that's so fun.

27
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:26,200
Oftentimes the best Atell.
Did you see a special road work?

28
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,640
It's so funny.
It's like you can get it,

29
00:01:28,641 --> 00:01:30,530
but it's still happy that he's doing
well again.

30
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:33,260
His show looks dope.
He's fucking hilarious.

31
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,650
Hilarious.
I don't think there is a funniest guy

32
00:01:36,651 --> 00:01:38,060
alive,
but he's one of my favorites,

33
00:01:38,061 --> 00:01:40,960
that's for sure.
I was saying at the table with my just

34
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:44,900
saying rounds of venture female comics
and we were like eating dessert.

35
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:47,270
It was like a really like sad moment.
He just walks up.

36
00:01:47,271 --> 00:01:47,991
We're like,
hey Dave.

37
00:01:47,991 --> 00:01:48,830
He's like,
oh,

38
00:01:48,831 --> 00:01:50,150
what are you guys having?
No boyfriend,

39
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:50,984
Allah mode,

40
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:01,340
a vet like Tiramisu.
Satis oh,

41
00:02:01,341 --> 00:02:02,240
that's so funny.

42
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,380
No boyfriend.
Like,

43
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,680
hey Dave.
He didn't even see us till he turned and

44
00:02:08,681 --> 00:02:10,990
then just boom,
fired out as a cat guy

45
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,720
right off the cuff.
Boom.

46
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:19,870
You just had tell him what Tom tell
story without Kimbo slice Kimbo slice

47
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,280
him ultimate fighter when you were guys
were doing that,

48
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,790
they don't even show this on the air.
So this guy,

49
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:27,350
I'm not gonna mention his name on the
show,

50
00:02:27,351 --> 00:02:30,290
he lost and you can drink all that
alcohol you want in the house and

51
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:34,490
there's only at the time there's only
four of us left still fighting Roy

52
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:38,030
Marcus Jones,
Mitch reone and uh,

53
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,560
myself.
That's the four fighting,

54
00:02:39,561 --> 00:02:41,150
right?
So one of you guys,

55
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,190
one of the other guys is hammered,
hammered.

56
00:02:43,191 --> 00:02:44,120
He's lost,
right.

57
00:02:44,121 --> 00:02:45,590
Hammered,
wasted.

58
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:49,690
All of a sudden this guy gets super
racist in the house and there's a whole

59
00:02:49,691 --> 00:02:51,470
bunch of black guys in the house.
Start,

60
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:53,120
stop.
Mountain House wife loves him because

61
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:57,830
the Iroquois nation and starts throwing
up racial slurs and throwing up these,

62
00:02:57,831 --> 00:02:58,550
you know,
the hit,

63
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,940
hey,
Hitler's Heil Hitler started his name on

64
00:03:00,941 --> 00:03:01,930
this piece of paper for me.

65
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:04,130
All right dude.
Dude,

66
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,590
this isn't getting out though,
right?

67
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,080
I just need it,
need to know for my own edification.

68
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:10,600
So he starts doing all this stuff.
I'm sleeping.

69
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,450
I've the biggest fight of my life.
The next day,

70
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,970
Dana white literally stops us in the car
and goes,

71
00:03:15,971 --> 00:03:19,150
listen,
if whoever makes to the finale where we

72
00:03:19,151 --> 00:03:20,710
win or not,
you're gonna be a superstar.

73
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:21,641
It's huge,
man.

74
00:03:21,641 --> 00:03:24,310
The biggest season we've ever had.
You guys want to win this fight.

75
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,510
Thank you.
No pressure.

76
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:30,780
So I'm sleeping and
I'm sleeping and uh,

77
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,560
I'm,
I'm sleeping on the ground and I thought

78
00:03:38,561 --> 00:03:40,420
it was a dream.
Kimbo slice and,

79
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:44,650
uh,
Marcus Jones and this and this d'amico

80
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:45,340
D'amico Rogers,
uh,

81
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,390
comes in my room.
They go,

82
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:47,530
yo sharp.
Get up,

83
00:03:47,531 --> 00:03:48,490
down.
Get up,

84
00:03:48,491 --> 00:03:49,270
man.
I'm like,

85
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,760
Huh,
why are there three large black?

86
00:03:51,761 --> 00:03:53,380
I run my bed.
Kim Goes,

87
00:03:53,381 --> 00:03:54,214
Yo,
man,

88
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:56,260
this dude's down to talking about our
people.

89
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:59,160
We're about to jack him up.
I literally,

90
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:00,070
I thought I was in gym.
I go,

91
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,410
excuse me,
it's talking about our people dog.

92
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:05,830
Let's go eff this dude up and like,
listen,

93
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:07,360
uh,
you guys realize,

94
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:07,841
I said,
I'm,

95
00:04:07,841 --> 00:04:09,160
I'm talking,
I'm not down with the race thing.

96
00:04:09,161 --> 00:04:11,950
I'm totally down to fuck this dude up.
But you realize I'm not black,

97
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:12,351
right,
Kim?

98
00:04:12,351 --> 00:04:13,330
He goes,
you ain't

99
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:15,880
no man.
He goes,

100
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:17,560
damn,
that's crazy.

101
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,720
Turnaround leaving.
I hear.

102
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:22,090
That's why I like shop.
You can't tell what the hell he is.

103
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:26,243
I go,
hey,

104
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,230
Kimbo,
that's racist.

105
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,073
Dahlias,
Ypo,

106
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,560
just cause I'm athletic and can file you
gotta be black.

107
00:04:32,561 --> 00:04:33,640
He goes,
you could be.

108
00:04:33,641 --> 00:04:35,230
And

109
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,870
the other day I was,
I was in Venice beach getting launched

110
00:04:40,871 --> 00:04:44,110
and I got a beer and a burger and
enjoyed something that's known in the

111
00:04:44,111 --> 00:04:46,570
state of California to have medicinal
benefit.

112
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,130
And I looked up in the,
uh,

113
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,690
whenever this place was,
this restaurant.

114
00:04:49,691 --> 00:04:53,230
And right over the door was the picture
of Obama from his Hawaii days.

115
00:04:53,231 --> 00:04:55,570
He had the hat on and he was smoking a
Doobie.

116
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,210
And for like a half a second,
I thought,

117
00:04:58,211 --> 00:05:00,820
that's my guy right there.
That's 2008 campaign trail,

118
00:05:00,821 --> 00:05:02,830
Obama.
And then of course,

119
00:05:02,831 --> 00:05:04,570
that's not what we got.
We got smart Bush.

120
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:08,890
Instead we got somebody who can like
come onto to the tonight show or the

121
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:12,550
view or something and just have the
host's eating out of his hand by the end

122
00:05:12,551 --> 00:05:15,970
of the interview.
So he's much smarter and more eloquent,

123
00:05:15,971 --> 00:05:18,520
but it's still doing a lot of the crazy
shit that Bush was doing.

124
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:22,050
And I think that he could still,
uh,

125
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,740
kind of like,
what's the word I'm looking for?

126
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:24,574
Like,
uh,

127
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,310
uh,
come out ahead and like still come

128
00:05:27,311 --> 00:05:30,580
across as a good president.
If you were to legalize weed at the

129
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:32,380
federal level,
I think most people be like,

130
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:32,801
oh,
okay.

131
00:05:32,801 --> 00:05:36,550
He actually did something meaningful
that will be around 50 years from now.

132
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,200
And it's not just like,
I'm going to tax,

133
00:05:38,201 --> 00:05:40,660
I'm going to find the shit out of you if
you don't sign up for my healthcare

134
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:41,710
website.
And,

135
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:44,050
uh,
I've done more drone strikes than any

136
00:05:44,051 --> 00:05:47,880
other president in history.
I've allowed NSA programs to expand and

137
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:51,520
said almost nothing in response if you
were even with all that shit,

138
00:05:51,521 --> 00:05:55,690
which I think is awful.
Legalize weed at the federal level and I

139
00:05:55,691 --> 00:05:58,490
would rate him as a good president.
Xi Are Hilarious,

140
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,740
first of all.
I don't think that that's a joint.

141
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:03,470
I think that picture is a cigarette.
I've looked at it many times.

142
00:06:03,471 --> 00:06:05,120
I've studied it like this approved or
film.

143
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:08,360
Let's look at it quite closely.
Have you ever noticed this when you're

144
00:06:08,361 --> 00:06:10,880
high?
Like everything seems to be a reminder

145
00:06:10,881 --> 00:06:12,260
that your high,
um,

146
00:06:12,261 --> 00:06:14,820
no because I've been getting high longer
than you son.

147
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:18,950
But the guys holding it,
I never hold a cigarette like that.

148
00:06:18,951 --> 00:06:20,000
He's really enjoying it.
Yeah.

149
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:24,500
Let me slows that closing on that bitch.
Let's get a CSI on this map.

150
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:28,250
Look how many closer.
Look how it's not like,

151
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:31,350
like it looks squished and stuff like
it's a role joint.

152
00:06:31,351 --> 00:06:33,570
We'll get this smoke signature and you
know what?

153
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:34,610
Here's a,
here's another,

154
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:36,950
here's another uh,
point.

155
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,580
Um,
look how far down he's already smoking

156
00:06:40,581 --> 00:06:42,230
it.
He would basically be in the filter.

157
00:06:42,231 --> 00:06:43,490
If it was a cigarette.
You're right.

158
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,690
100% rolled his own cigarette.
He's a cowboy.

159
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,940
Wow.
I know dudes who do that rolled

160
00:06:49,941 --> 00:06:51,620
menthols.
Oh,

161
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,100
how dare you.
He's the commander in chief.

162
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,440
You're a man,
boy,

163
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,980
he's the commander in chief.
You son of a bitch.
