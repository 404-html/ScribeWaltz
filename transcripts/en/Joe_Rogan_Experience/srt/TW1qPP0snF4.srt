00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:02,890
Hello Freak bitches,

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:03,670
Pokemon,

3
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:04,481
the Pokemon games,

4
00:00:04,481 --> 00:00:07,750
taking it to the next level because
now it explain what's going on.

5
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:08,411
It's way to,

6
00:00:08,411 --> 00:00:09,580
to say what Pokemon is.

7
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:10,810
It takes Google maps,

8
00:00:10,811 --> 00:00:12,070
you have to sign into Google,

9
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:15,940
it takes Google maps and
all the information that's
in Google maps and it makes

10
00:00:15,941 --> 00:00:17,650
it the level of video game.

11
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,660
So instead of playing a level,

12
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,010
you're playing your own street,

13
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,650
you're finding you're finding
creatures in your house.

14
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:24,843
And uh,

15
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:26,410
so yeah,

16
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,290
so then there's places like
churches are called Jim's.

17
00:00:29,291 --> 00:00:30,190
That's where you go.

18
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:31,510
And if you go to a church,

19
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:31,930
uh,

20
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:35,740
you can train your fighter to
be stronger and stuff like that.

21
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,720
So you're using real world,

22
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:38,680
uh,

23
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,910
places and like,

24
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:40,330
uh,

25
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:44,140
like landmarks and you're finding
things that like water fountains.

26
00:00:44,141 --> 00:00:45,340
Like if you go to the water fountain,

27
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:46,900
there's a bunch of coins there.

28
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:47,890
So it's using the,

29
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:52,300
and what's crazy is like if you're at
the comedy store it on Google maps,

30
00:00:52,301 --> 00:00:53,920
you can like upload your own photos,

31
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:54,470
you know,

32
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:54,730
like,

33
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:57,160
like I was at the comedy
store it on Google maps,

34
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,860
so it pulls that information also.

35
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:01,150
So if you're playing the game,

36
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:01,930
you'll be like,

37
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:02,111
oh,

38
00:01:02,111 --> 00:01:04,420
there's Andy Kaufman sign.

39
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:06,130
If we go to the Andy Kaufman sign,

40
00:01:06,131 --> 00:01:10,120
we can get some treasures and it shows
you the Andy Kaufman sign in the video

41
00:01:10,121 --> 00:01:10,780
game.

42
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,220
But here's the crazy thing.

43
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:14,170
In one like two days,

44
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:17,380
it's almost every single person
has downloaded it and played it.

45
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:22,630
And the crazy thing I was thinking of
is how awesome is it that it's connected

46
00:01:22,631 --> 00:01:24,510
to Google and we're sending cause it,

47
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:29,650
it opens your camera at parts of the game
when you're battling and it's scanning

48
00:01:29,651 --> 00:01:30,221
your room,

49
00:01:30,221 --> 00:01:31,054
your houses,

50
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,920
and it's sending it to Google.

51
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:37,450
So this is like the best way that Google
is now getting a complete map of our

52
00:01:37,451 --> 00:01:38,560
house inside.

53
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:39,550
It's uh,

54
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:40,930
like it's,

55
00:01:40,931 --> 00:01:45,340
it's scanning every street and like one
year your Google is going to be able to

56
00:01:45,341 --> 00:01:50,341
have to see every single inch of every
single place inside and outside because

57
00:01:50,561 --> 00:01:51,130
of this game.

58
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:51,881
How long has it been out?

59
00:01:51,881 --> 00:01:52,451
Like three days,

60
00:01:52,451 --> 00:01:52,750
right?

61
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:53,140
Three days.

62
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:53,471
Sorry,

63
00:01:53,471 --> 00:01:55,510
I'm more phones on android than Tinder.

64
00:01:55,511 --> 00:01:56,344
And it's about the past.

65
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:57,010
Twitter.

66
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:57,520
Yeah.

67
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,560
I really think we should
bring typewriters back.

68
00:01:59,561 --> 00:02:00,310
I'm sorry.

69
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:02,380
And no one's thinking about this though,

70
00:02:02,381 --> 00:02:03,270
weren't just low.

71
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:07,840
Opening our camera and recording our
rooms and sending it to Google can wait a

72
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,120
minute.

73
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:08,953
Is this real

74
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,880
Joe [inaudible] disposal?

75
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:12,970
I knew we were going to talk about it.

76
00:02:12,971 --> 00:02:14,140
So I pulled up some stuff already.

77
00:02:14,141 --> 00:02:14,974
There's like a,

78
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:19,120
the interesting thing that's happening
with it being on open gps maps is those

79
00:02:19,121 --> 00:02:19,601
places,

80
00:02:19,601 --> 00:02:20,470
those locations,

81
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:23,950
like there's a guy's home that's been
turned into one of these gyms and he's

82
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,690
like mad that people are
showing up outside of it.

83
00:02:25,691 --> 00:02:25,780
Yeah.

84
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:26,613
Place.

85
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,540
It's because he bought an old church and
so churches in the game automatically

86
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:31,161
become Jim.

87
00:02:31,161 --> 00:02:32,050
So people are hanging out.

88
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:32,101
Yeah.

89
00:02:32,101 --> 00:02:32,420
Outside

90
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,260
of his house now.

91
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:35,780
But also interesting things
like this has happened.

92
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:36,920
Where are the west boat?

93
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:40,430
Westboro Baptist Church has been
overtaken by a gay friendly Pokemon.

94
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,070
And so people were like kind of,

95
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:44,330
I don't know necessarily
trolling them and whatnot,

96
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:46,843
but then,

97
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:47,080
uh,

98
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,460
so by walking around
and looking for things,

99
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:52,970
a teenager found a dead body somewhere
and just three days they've already

100
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:57,680
dead body found by teenager
hunting water Pokemon.

101
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:59,380
She found it underneath the bridge.

102
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,190
Oh my

103
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,023
God.

104
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,170
This part two

105
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:04,490
I was trying to get a water,

106
00:03:04,491 --> 00:03:05,900
Pokemon Wiggins totes,

107
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:06,883
CNN.

108
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,890
Instead she made the alarming
and alarming discovery,

109
00:03:09,891 --> 00:03:13,880
a dead body close to the
Wyoming highway seven 89 bridge.

110
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,120
I probably would have never went down
there if it weren't for this game.

111
00:03:17,121 --> 00:03:17,954
She admitted,

112
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:22,680
but the scary incident isn't deterring
her and says she will continue to play.

113
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:26,640
I saw somebody playing on
the highway on the way here.

114
00:03:26,641 --> 00:03:27,960
I saw somebody playing on the highway.

115
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:32,250
It's bad enough we don't need the last
night when I was waiting for my Uber at

116
00:03:32,251 --> 00:03:32,780
my house,

117
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,050
I just three minutes,

118
00:03:34,051 --> 00:03:35,880
I saw two different groups of kids,

119
00:03:35,881 --> 00:03:39,960
like one on skateboards and one on bikes
just playing the game and what's scary

120
00:03:39,961 --> 00:03:44,961
is like on that article now armed robbers
are robbing people at certain places

121
00:03:45,511 --> 00:03:47,880
in the game because they know the kids
are going to be there with like new

122
00:03:47,881 --> 00:03:49,350
phones like I phones and stuff.

123
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:52,680
So they're waiting at certain places
coming out stealing our phones.

124
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,580
Oh.

125
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:59,190
Because it's same allows players to
drop module in a real world location to

126
00:03:59,191 --> 00:04:03,210
attract high numbers of
Pokemon for 30 minutes.

127
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:07,290
The lure modules have reportedly also
been used by business owners to bring

128
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:08,580
people to their stores.

129
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:10,050
What?

130
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,333
Say,

131
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:11,540
oh,

132
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,410
so this is the next level.

133
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:14,370
This is,

134
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:16,080
this is what starts the next level,

135
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:17,100
this kind of thing.

136
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,420
The next level of

137
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:19,810
Internet,

138
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:20,643
augmented reality,

139
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:24,100
it's going to take over
and it's also scanning,

140
00:04:24,101 --> 00:04:27,520
just like snapchat scanned all our faces
using all these filters now and they

141
00:04:27,521 --> 00:04:28,150
have perfect,

142
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,550
they could three d model all
our faces now because we,

143
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,100
we've been I her or faces now,

144
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:33,560
they ever,

145
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,650
they're scanning the whole
entire United States.

146
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:39,490
They're going to have maps of everything
inside and outside in like less than a

147
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:39,790
year.

148
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:40,061
Well,

149
00:04:40,061 --> 00:04:40,894
do you think,

150
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,870
didn't we think though that eventually
that that was going to be inevitable and

151
00:04:43,871 --> 00:04:45,070
that was going to be unavoidable?

152
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:48,700
There's the technology's gonna
dissolve all the windows.

153
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:49,001
Well,

154
00:04:49,001 --> 00:04:51,340
this is the next is
dissolving in the windows.

155
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:52,421
No more curtains.

156
00:04:52,421 --> 00:04:55,630
That's also fascinating that
it's an augmented reality.

157
00:04:55,631 --> 00:04:55,900
Like,

158
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,130
that's what God,

159
00:04:57,131 --> 00:04:58,440
everybody in like that.

160
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,320
The augmented reality is what snuck
everybody in and then everybody's like,

161
00:05:02,321 --> 00:05:02,891
Oh man,

162
00:05:02,891 --> 00:05:03,980
let's play a game.

163
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:09,930
And then you're completely sucked into
this very bizarre new world where you're

164
00:05:11,441 --> 00:05:15,280
playing a game but wrapped around
your own actual environment.

165
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:15,700
What he's showing.

166
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:19,270
This guy owns the gym of that guy's house,

167
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:24,420
so virtual owner of the
property technically,

168
00:05:24,521 --> 00:05:26,790
and it can be Kenyan
or stolen or taken her

169
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,713
John.

170
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:28,910
Woo Hoo.

171
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,930
I met the owner of my gym.

172
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:31,883
Nice guy.

173
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,113
Oh my God.

174
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:34,741
He's like a,

175
00:05:34,741 --> 00:05:35,041
yeah,

176
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:36,690
please don't tell anybody where I live,

177
00:05:36,691 --> 00:05:37,020
dude.

178
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,170
Get away from my apartment,

179
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:38,600
my house.

180
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,390
I mean,

181
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,290
they're going to get sued.

182
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:42,450
Those Pokemon people are
going to get sued for sure.

183
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:45,480
There's going to be a lot
of lawsuits about this game.

184
00:05:45,481 --> 00:05:46,860
There's going to be a lot of people dying.

185
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:47,610
I,

186
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:48,900
like I said on the way here,

187
00:05:48,901 --> 00:05:51,950
I saw somebody using it
while driving because you,

188
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:56,410
do you think that dead body was somebody
trying to get a water Pokemon invest

189
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,313
and no,

190
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,500
that dead body was probably somebody
murdered or a homeless person.

191
00:06:00,501 --> 00:06:01,100
Yeah.

192
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,050
I mean it doesn't have to be,

193
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,100
but he could have been under that.

194
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:04,934
Where's the water?

195
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:06,770
Well there's some neat,

196
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:07,730
okay.

197
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:09,140
When you find something,

198
00:06:09,141 --> 00:06:10,530
find like a water lord.

199
00:06:10,531 --> 00:06:11,360
Is that what it was?

200
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,193
Yeah,

201
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:12,841
no,

202
00:06:12,841 --> 00:06:13,674
it's an alert.

203
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:16,190
It's this thing that you
can drop on the ground.

204
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,140
And so did someone drop
it where the home was,

205
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,190
where the dead person was?

206
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:19,611
No,

207
00:06:19,611 --> 00:06:22,100
she was just searching for Pokemon go.

208
00:06:22,101 --> 00:06:22,640
It's kind of,

209
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,270
it reminds me of like when you're a kid,

210
00:06:24,271 --> 00:06:27,200
you know when your bicycle bicycle and
you're going around in your neighborhood

211
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,190
like playing adventure,

212
00:06:28,191 --> 00:06:29,960
like looking at things and finding things.

213
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:30,780
It's kind of like that.

214
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,450
They makes you kind of go
out in your neighborhood.

215
00:06:32,451 --> 00:06:33,650
You look at stuff like,

216
00:06:33,651 --> 00:06:36,530
I didn't know that there was like a
Buddha across the street and like this

217
00:06:36,531 --> 00:06:40,220
forest by my house and I found out by
this game cause it was like go here,

218
00:06:40,221 --> 00:06:40,461
you know,

219
00:06:40,461 --> 00:06:41,960
there's some stuff here.

220
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:45,650
And so it's Kinda cool because it shows
you around your neighborhood and stuff

221
00:06:45,651 --> 00:06:47,330
like that that you might've not known.

222
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,980
It's kind of like that old game,

223
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:52,160
that Geo tagging game that people used
to play where it's like go to these

224
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:54,350
coordinates and you'll
find like a present.

225
00:06:54,351 --> 00:06:57,850
And you know if you got
really cynical you'd be,

226
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:58,510
it's like,

227
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:01,730
it's like some sort of an alien
talking to you going move around your

228
00:07:01,731 --> 00:07:03,800
coordinates and take
photographs of everything.

229
00:07:03,801 --> 00:07:05,450
So I can repeat it perfectly.

230
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:09,260
It's really interesting to see what
businesses businesses are doing.

231
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:09,981
Like dairy queen,

232
00:07:09,981 --> 00:07:10,491
like I said,

233
00:07:10,491 --> 00:07:14,390
dropped something on the ground and
it's like paying customers only can come

234
00:07:14,391 --> 00:07:15,960
here and get came on.

235
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,860
So that's probably smart.

236
00:07:18,861 --> 00:07:19,190
Yeah,

237
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,030
that's smart for them.

238
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:23,210
Can you mad like I grew
up in south Philly,

239
00:07:23,211 --> 00:07:26,330
we didn't look at anything and if we
saw something we just kept walking.

240
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,820
Well we don't have to
do that anymore Eleanor.

241
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:30,530
There's no more slaves.

242
00:07:30,531 --> 00:07:34,250
And now you don't have to ride a horse
around taking pictures around my mom's

243
00:07:34,251 --> 00:07:35,084
neighborhood.

244
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:36,860
So let me explain to me,

245
00:07:36,861 --> 00:07:38,450
cause let me understand how this works.

246
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,530
You're playing it.

247
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,930
So if you're playing it like
what are you seeing right?

248
00:07:41,931 --> 00:07:43,190
You see on the ground right now?

249
00:07:43,191 --> 00:07:45,050
I see nothing I'm looking around.

250
00:07:45,051 --> 00:07:47,270
I could see down the street there's uh,

251
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:47,720
some,

252
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,080
some cool places to get more
coin or it's called pokey balls,

253
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,250
which you use to capture.

254
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,080
These places exist.

255
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,510
How they just like,

256
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:57,620
they just decide that
the things are there.

257
00:07:57,621 --> 00:07:58,430
It's random.

258
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:01,850
But what they usually do is they
take certain things in Google maps,

259
00:08:01,851 --> 00:08:05,600
like all their churches are gyms where
you go to workout and stuff like that.

260
00:08:05,601 --> 00:08:06,434
Your pokemons.

261
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,580
Then they take like,

262
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:11,780
like things like the comedy store and
they put certain like they know it's a

263
00:08:11,781 --> 00:08:12,850
landmark so they,

264
00:08:12,851 --> 00:08:13,341
they,

265
00:08:13,341 --> 00:08:14,840
there's a lot going on there.

266
00:08:14,841 --> 00:08:15,674
Like last night,

267
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,850
if you go to the comedy store now,

268
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,170
you haven't been there
in a couple of days.

269
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:19,550
Every single person's playing,

270
00:08:19,551 --> 00:08:20,600
every single person working.

271
00:08:20,601 --> 00:08:21,680
There's playing every comic.

272
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:22,190
There's,

273
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,780
everyone's just out there on their phones.

274
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,680
How this happens so quick,

275
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,260
it's,

276
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:26,720
it's,

277
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,800
it's huge man.

278
00:08:27,801 --> 00:08:28,150
It's,

279
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:30,440
I just heard about this
like maybe two days ago,

280
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,530
two days ago I saw a couple of
pictures and April fool's joke

281
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:34,541
on youtube,

282
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:38,280
this video of what know someone
made a fake application.

283
00:08:38,281 --> 00:08:42,710
I looked like this and it turned out to
be a really good idea that someone took,

284
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:43,180
develop,

285
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:43,460
develop.

286
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,320
It does now

287
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:45,850
overnight.

288
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:49,100
It's doing it because it really hits
this nerve and your head of collecting

289
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,080
things and when you're going like,

290
00:08:51,081 --> 00:08:51,340
look at,

291
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:51,940
I've collected,

292
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,830
w will look what I've collected and
it's the perfect thing to do when you're

293
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,321
bored.

294
00:08:55,321 --> 00:08:56,460
Like I was in an Uber.

295
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,620
I'm just sitting there while we're
driving by the Hollywood bowl.

296
00:08:58,650 --> 00:08:58,890
I'm like,

297
00:08:58,890 --> 00:08:59,041
oh,

298
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:00,180
there's some cool stuff here.

299
00:09:00,181 --> 00:09:01,014
I'm going to get here.

300
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,210
So it's a good thing to do when you're,

301
00:09:02,211 --> 00:09:03,340
you have nothing else to do.

302
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:06,060
What do you mean get it
as long as your phone?

303
00:09:06,061 --> 00:09:08,130
It's like you're collecting virtual items.

304
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,990
It's like you're collecting virtual items.

305
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:11,310
Like whoa.

306
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:16,850
Pokemon chasing investors
led oh 10 Nintendo's goal.

307
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,391
Go out there and make,

308
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,224
just make it smaller.

309
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:23,670
Send in tendo shares soar and craze
added 9 billion in market value.

310
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:24,910
Two gave me company,

311
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,000
Nintendo was hurtin.

312
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,040
Mathinna was hurting before this.

313
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:29,521
Come on.

314
00:09:29,521 --> 00:09:30,840
This is incredible.

315
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:31,780
The,

316
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,311
okay,

317
00:09:32,311 --> 00:09:34,320
so you're walking around
explaining this to me.

318
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:37,350
I'm looking at this person holding their
hand and said they're walking around

319
00:09:37,351 --> 00:09:40,980
and they have like a phone open where the,

320
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:42,720
they see the image of
what's in front of them.

321
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:45,360
But Pokemon stuff is just
sort of floating around.

322
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:45,900
Yeah.

323
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:46,711
Oh my God,

324
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:47,311
this is crazy.

325
00:09:47,311 --> 00:09:48,540
And then you could grow eggs,

326
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:49,200
you can share,

327
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,070
share are,

328
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,880
you can train your characters to be
stronger and then you can battle other

329
00:09:53,881 --> 00:09:55,110
characters at gyms.

330
00:09:55,111 --> 00:09:55,281
And,

331
00:09:55,281 --> 00:09:56,114
and it's,

332
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,510
and this is by the way,

333
00:09:57,511 --> 00:09:59,100
is just the first version.

334
00:09:59,101 --> 00:09:59,670
They just,

335
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:00,000
you know,

336
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,330
they're,

337
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:01,890
they're going to be
adding so much to this.

338
00:10:01,891 --> 00:10:03,840
And what's interesting to note,

339
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:08,160
I heard a rumor maybe that the new grand
theft auto is going to be doing the

340
00:10:08,161 --> 00:10:08,994
same thing.

341
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:11,640
So you're going to be playing
grand theft auto using Google maps.

342
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,980
So you're going to be at your house and
your house is going to be your house.

343
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,360
And so this is just the beginning of
this whole idea of taking Google's

344
00:10:18,361 --> 00:10:18,961
information.

345
00:10:18,961 --> 00:10:22,210
And I think giving them
the people outside one.

346
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:26,400
One of the things is that they're already
saying that people are are like kids

347
00:10:26,401 --> 00:10:28,760
are complaining about sore legs and like

348
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:36,300
maybe this would be the video game that
fixes fixes people who are addicted to

349
00:10:36,301 --> 00:10:37,021
video games.

350
00:10:37,021 --> 00:10:37,854
Yeah.

351
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:39,300
I mean that's wow.

352
00:10:39,301 --> 00:10:40,081
Only positive thing.

353
00:10:40,081 --> 00:10:41,440
I see her,

354
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:43,320
I'll just hanging around
playing with each other.

355
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,620
Oh my God,

356
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,510
this is insane.

357
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:46,680
This is like the comedy store lesson.

358
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,690
Comicon in San Diego is going to be a zoo.

359
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,140
Yeah,

360
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:53,610
I forgot about stuff like
that is fucking insane.

361
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,810
I can't believe I just legs.

362
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,400
Is that from being sore?

363
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:58,910
That's like the Mother Teresa.

364
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,660
I also heard that they
banned it in San Francisco,

365
00:11:03,661 --> 00:11:05,300
but I haven't looked to
see if that's true or not.

366
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:08,430
Like some cities are actually banning
it because people are not paying

367
00:11:08,431 --> 00:11:08,911
attention.

368
00:11:08,911 --> 00:11:13,800
Just going into traffic and there was
probably a lot of them on the four oh five

369
00:11:13,801 --> 00:11:14,634
today.

370
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:15,481
Oh,

371
00:11:15,481 --> 00:11:16,314
I solved them.

372
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,400
If you think about it,

373
00:11:17,401 --> 00:11:21,900
this is probably just the next step
in what we're eventually going to get,

374
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:25,680
which is some sort of a reality
that we can manipulate all the time.

375
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,180
Like this is one part of it.

376
00:11:27,181 --> 00:11:29,280
We're going to have a little
games in the regular reality,

377
00:11:29,281 --> 00:11:31,110
but you could just have to look
through your phone to see it.

378
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,180
But how long before that's
glasses that you're wearing?

379
00:11:33,181 --> 00:11:34,830
Like that Microsoft Shit?

380
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,580
Yeah.

381
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:36,930
What?

382
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:37,741
What is it called again?

383
00:11:37,741 --> 00:11:38,574
Magic leap.

384
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:39,841
That's one.

385
00:11:39,841 --> 00:11:41,000
I think that's the Google one.

386
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,450
Microsoft Hollow Lens is a,

387
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,590
are they both with goggles?

388
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,150
Both augmented reality bit there.

389
00:11:48,151 --> 00:11:50,690
Both developed around augmented
reality supposedly magically leap.

390
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,990
It's supposed to be awesome.

391
00:11:51,991 --> 00:11:53,190
I don't want to say so.

392
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,250
No one likes regular

393
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:54,791
reality.

394
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:55,301
Anyone come on.

395
00:11:55,301 --> 00:11:56,800
If you have a pair of glasses,

396
00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:00,550
if you just put on a pair of glasses
that you put on a pair of like they live

397
00:12:00,551 --> 00:12:01,030
style,

398
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:01,241
I mean,

399
00:12:01,241 --> 00:12:01,841
Jesus Christ,

400
00:12:01,841 --> 00:12:03,040
they live is going to be real.

401
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:07,960
You put on a pair of glasses and then
you see and you see all kinds of crazy

402
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:08,794
shit.

403
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:18,350
Yeah.
