1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:03,570
This is real,
this is live is really happening.

2
00:00:03,571 --> 00:00:08,571
This is what the Joe Rogan experience 
podcast is brought to you by the 

3
00:00:09,181 --> 00:00:11,460
fleshlight.
I was going to get that.

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,210
Go ahead.
If you go to Joe Rogan.net

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,300
and click on the link for the flashlight
and enter in the code name Rogan,

6
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,630
you will get 15 percent off.
Number one,

7
00:00:21,631 --> 00:00:24,780
sex toy for a man.
That's it.

8
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:26,460
That's the end.
Is there a number two?

9
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,230
Number two flashlight.
Is there a number two?

10
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:32,820
Number two,
what?

11
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,310
Sex Toy?
That's a good question.

12
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:39,880
What is number two?
Your hand going to shut off the music,

13
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:40,700
right?

14
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:49,330
Number two is probably one of those 
standard blowup dolls I bought.

15
00:00:49,331 --> 00:00:52,120
That still gets action.
I will never use one of the.

16
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,860
I don't think.
No,

17
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:55,680
I don't know anybody who does that.
Maybe stanhouse.

18
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:58,280
You have one?
Have you used them to Joanna?

19
00:00:58,281 --> 00:01:00,620
Angel wine and it's a.
It feels like it.

20
00:01:00,621 --> 00:01:02,360
You're one of those racks like at the 
pool.

21
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,130
You know,
it smells like a raffle.

22
00:01:04,131 --> 00:01:05,990
I fucked a lot of RAF.
Yeah.

23
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,460
Does that.
So maybe I shouldn't have.

24
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:08,690
Yeah.
Feels like it.

25
00:01:08,691 --> 00:01:10,400
So.
Oh God.

26
00:01:10,401 --> 00:01:12,050
So it's just kind of a whole.
Yeah.

27
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:13,820
And what's cool though is the one I have
a,

28
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,950
I have you take out the fleshlight out 
of it,

29
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:20,970
the,
the case like fish in the bucket thing 

30
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:20,970
and he put it through the whole of the 
blowup doll.

31
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:25,540
Then it's okay,
but then you're still feeling like 

32
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:25,540
you're fucking,
you're saying take the

33
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:30,230
insides of a flashlight,
the good feeling part and stuff it into 

34
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:30,230
that hole.

35
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:34,180
Yeah.
I said that you could do it in a gas 

36
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,381
tank as well.
Just stick a fucking put clothing on the

37
00:01:37,201 --> 00:01:40,950
doll and it kind of is on the car.
Oh yeah.

38
00:01:40,951 --> 00:01:45,130
Well I think you're even more fucked up 
to pretending that things a purse.

39
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:47,280
Well that makes me,
I swear to God,

40
00:01:47,281 --> 00:01:52,281
it makes me a little sick to my stomach.
Thinking about how is it when you're 

41
00:01:52,281 --> 00:01:56,270
especially horny or lonely or what?
Neal Brennan is talking like Neal 

42
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:58,440
Brennan?
Yeah.

43
00:01:58,441 --> 00:01:59,040
Hey guys.

44
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:05,570
Indian slash producer,
character slash director slash just all 

45
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:05,620
around Hollywood bed.

46
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,470
I'm starting to realize something about 
myself,

47
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:10,890
which is a standard.
Like I like,

48
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,760
I like talking.
You like talking?

49
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,920
Yeah.
Meaning like I like Chapelle one time,

50
00:02:16,921 --> 00:02:21,921
said he'd made a fortune,
he talked his way into a fortune and 

51
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:27,170
which always,
and now I realize what he means just 

52
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:30,111
because I've been doing a lot of road 
shows and gigs and shit and you just 

53
00:02:30,111 --> 00:02:30,111
have to talk,
right?

54
00:02:30,111 --> 00:02:32,350
But you got to go do radio and talk and 
talk and talk and you just.

55
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:33,120
And I go,
Oh yeah,

56
00:02:33,121 --> 00:02:38,121
I like talking.
It doesn't feel like work to me to go 

57
00:02:38,121 --> 00:02:38,121
when people are like,
do you hate doing ready?

58
00:02:38,121 --> 00:02:39,300
I'm like,
I don't know.

59
00:02:39,301 --> 00:02:43,200
You go and tell jokes and be funny.
Maybe you think of something new.

60
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:45,570
It seems all right to me.
It doesn't bother me.

61
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,800
Well,
you're a,

62
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:51,390
you're a writer as well.
And writing is so much more difficult to

63
00:02:51,391 --> 00:02:52,620
just talk and shit.

64
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:57,760
Ah,
well that's what made me realize that 

65
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:57,760
this guy,
Alan Stevens or seven comedian,

66
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,700
uh,
he wrote for and he said,

67
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,230
he goes,
I'm actually not even a writer.

68
00:03:02,231 --> 00:03:04,480
I'm just a bullshitter.
Which is like,

69
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,470
I know what he means now.
Like I,

70
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,350
I really want.
The minute he said it,

71
00:03:08,351 --> 00:03:10,310
I was like,
I'm a bullshitter too.

72
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:15,370
Like I write better jokes,
just talk and I can write good jokes 

73
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:15,720
writing,
but I'll.

74
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:20,820
They can,
they'll get a little bit better if 

75
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:20,820
there's a social center.

76
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:24,420
Yeah,
there's some that just only come out 

77
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:24,420
when you talk to.

78
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,820
Yeah.
Is there some about like the pressure of

79
00:03:25,821 --> 00:03:29,150
having that human thing that you need to
please,

80
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:32,330
particularly if they're comedians that 
you like and respect.

81
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:37,360
That's why I like writing with a guys.
I'm friends with you because it's like,

82
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,420
Eh,
I don't want to,

83
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:43,900
first of all,
don't want to have to pitch to a guy 

84
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:43,900
that I secretly don't think is funny.

85
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,530
Yeah.
And there's something about bouncing 

86
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,301
some of off likeminded people's heads 
that also allows you to come up with 

87
00:03:49,301 --> 00:03:50,180
some shit.
You know,

88
00:03:50,181 --> 00:03:55,181
when you know a guy's already got 
several steps of the puzzle figured out 

89
00:03:55,181 --> 00:03:56,480
along with you and that Nigga.
What the fuck?

90
00:03:56,481 --> 00:03:58,000
Yes.
The other thing is the,

91
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:03,210
there's that Chappelle used to say that 
he and I were like thrilled killers 

92
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,590
where he'd like stabbed the person and 
I'd be like,

93
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,850
good her fucking head off Dave because 
you're just so like,

94
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,310
you're like,
you want to one up that person.

95
00:04:12,311 --> 00:04:15,690
Then he went up to you and then and then
you got like a vineyard,

96
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:17,160
you're talking and then you really don't
know.

97
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:20,120
Well,
that's always offends me when people put

98
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:24,350
comedians on the line for really,
really outrageous shit.

99
00:04:24,351 --> 00:04:29,351
They said onstage as if they really mean
that drives me nuts sometimes because 

100
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:35,320
half of what we do is try to say the 
most fucked up thing.

101
00:04:35,511 --> 00:04:40,511
Like you didn't just fucking go there.
Like when you're talking to a bunch of 

102
00:04:40,511 --> 00:04:40,511
comics and you're hanging out with 
comics,

103
00:04:40,511 --> 00:04:41,070
we,
you know,

104
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:46,180
we're going to go,
we're going to go to the most fucked up 

105
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:46,840
place possible because that's the only 
way to make the person laugh,

106
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:49,190
to get us to.
That gets us off anymore.

107
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:54,320
I mean,
we endorsed the idea of whenever it is 

108
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,130
beastiality anything,

109
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,380
you know what I mean?
Like I'm not,

110
00:04:56,381 --> 00:04:57,970
like,
there's nothing in my,

111
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,530
and I'm like,
this is a fact,

112
00:04:59,531 --> 00:05:03,320
this is written in stone and this.
It's like,

113
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,350
here's,
here's an idea,

114
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:10,380
here's another idea.
Doesn't mean that if your brain goes 

115
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:10,380
there,
yeah.

116
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:14,671
It goes back to that tracy argument of 
like what Morgan tracey Morgan the other

117
00:05:15,221 --> 00:05:20,221
night at the comedy store,
I do a joke about a mark twain and how 

118
00:05:20,831 --> 00:05:25,831
they're taking all the words out of 
Huckleberry Finn and I ended up saying 

119
00:05:25,831 --> 00:05:28,680
nigger like seven times.
No one's ever had a problem with that at

120
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,630
all black rooms because I never say it 
as myself.

121
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:36,631
Of course I say it as in yes.
Finally a girl in the audience goes,

122
00:05:36,851 --> 00:05:38,470
no,
and I'm like,

123
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:39,310
what?
She goes,

124
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,530
you can't say it.
And I was like,

125
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,960
why?
Why can't a black girl?

126
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:44,950
I go,
why can't I?

127
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:45,910
And she's like,
well,

128
00:05:45,911 --> 00:05:48,820
I don't in here and call you cracker.
And I was like,

129
00:05:48,821 --> 00:05:49,810
well,
you just did.

130
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:50,960
That's a.
and I didn't,

131
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:53,680
didn't bother me at all.
Got The show back.

132
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:54,790
Got It.
Righted the ship.

133
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:57,560
We ended up talking for about an hour 
after the show.

134
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,410
Me and the girl and she was like,
I go,

135
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,000
you know,
before I did that joke,

136
00:06:02,001 --> 00:06:07,001
I specifically did jokes about Mexicans 
and Asians and you didn't have any 

137
00:06:07,001 --> 00:06:07,001
problem with that.
She was like,

138
00:06:07,001 --> 00:06:07,430
no,
I didn't have.

139
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:08,690
And I go,
so you,

140
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,560
your problem is with racism against 
black people,

141
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:16,520
but not all racism.
You're fine with racism at large,

142
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:21,940
but you're cool with it,
but you're against it when it's against 

143
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:22,160
black people.
Which she's like,

144
00:06:22,161 --> 00:06:23,090
yeah,
I'm a hypocrite.

145
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,940
So we ended up having like a half hour 
discussion.

146
00:06:25,941 --> 00:06:28,490
She walks away.
She one of these people who like,

147
00:06:28,491 --> 00:06:30,410
she's never lost an argument in her 
life,

148
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,750
like,
just didn't even when I wasn't.

149
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,550
So like she doesn't know why I won the 
argument.

150
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,340
She walks away.
You and I know.

151
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,280
Uh,
she knows.

152
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,000
Yeah,
she walks,

153
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:45,350
she walks away and uh,
and her husband goes,

154
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,760
here's the problem.
And he goes,

155
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:48,980
I know that you don't have any hate in 
your heart.

156
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,140
Problem is she does.
She does have.

157
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:57,310
So she had,
she had said during the conversation 

158
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,771
that's been dropped on you,
that dude's a week away from telling 

159
00:06:59,771 --> 00:06:59,771
that bit.
Well,

160
00:06:59,771 --> 00:07:00,890
no,
he just say that to random people at the

161
00:07:00,891 --> 00:07:02,550
comedy store.
She's got her heart.

162
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:02,890
You.
Well,

163
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:07,900
he wasn't saying it like that.
He was just saying it like she's got 

164
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:11,531
like she is up the mind that white 
people are constantly saying the n word 

165
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:11,531
and it's like,
no,

166
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:11,531
we're not.
I've,

167
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:16,280
I told her,
you know how many times I've heard it 

168
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,890
without a speak for yourself saying that
he's saying that she said she recognizes

169
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:23,860
the argument that she thinks that white 
people are constantly using the emerald 

170
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:23,860
wise will run around.

171
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:28,430
It's like if a guy uses the n word in 
that way,

172
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:33,940
if he's not,
if he's not being funny because there's 

173
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,450
no humor to it.
I did get disgusted.

174
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:40,500
That's how many times I haven't even 
heard it without a sense of humor or I 

175
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:44,430
go,
maybe I've heard it five times and I 

176
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:44,430
have,
I have,

177
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,560
I have definitely were mostly.
Did you hear it in Jersey?

178
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,470
Yeah,
I heard it in Boston a lot.

179
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,610
Oh,
right.

180
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,220
I heard that.
I've heard a guy at times,

181
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:57,280
you know,
I've been around people that were 

182
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:57,280
looking to jump racists.
It's creepy.

183
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:57,280
It's creepy to here,
you know,

184
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,470
and these fucking Niggas and they go,
Whoa,

185
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,160
whoa,
Whoa,

186
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,480
whoa.
Yeah,

187
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,400
whoa.
Yeah.

188
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,850
Just because some black people did some 
fucked up shit,

189
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:10,610
you know.
Have you ever seen gone with the wind?

190
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:11,810
Yeah,
I think I have,

191
00:08:11,811 --> 00:08:13,160
but it was a long time ago.

192
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:16,220
That is the most racist movie in the 
whole entire world.

193
00:08:16,221 --> 00:08:17,900
I just watched it from my first time 
recently.

194
00:08:17,901 --> 00:08:22,901
I think it was 1930.
I don't think I've ever watched watches 

195
00:08:22,901 --> 00:08:25,450
39 because the guy,
one guy a directed a gone with the wind 

196
00:08:25,581 --> 00:08:28,190
and wizard of Oz in the same year,
but he did wizard of Oz.

197
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,890
Well that makes completely sense because
I,

198
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,640
because I thought it feels like the 
wizard of Oz but racist and,

199
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:39,440
and there was the same like production 
design in the same feeling of it.

200
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:42,650
The,
there was one scene where it was late at

201
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:45,050
night and there was like tons of little 
white children in their beds.

202
00:08:45,051 --> 00:08:50,051
And then there's this black child 
cranking this fan to fan all the white 

203
00:08:50,051 --> 00:08:51,800
children when they slept.
Yes.

204
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:57,430
Oh my God.
There was the part where the main 

205
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:58,200
actors,
the one that Clark Gable says,

206
00:08:58,201 --> 00:08:58,950
you know,
frankly my dear,

207
00:08:58,951 --> 00:09:02,100
I don't give a damn that girl,
like she has like a slave and she's like

208
00:09:02,101 --> 00:09:07,101
slapping the slave in the face because 
she wouldn't shut up or something like 

209
00:09:07,101 --> 00:09:07,101
that.

210
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:12,180
It is so uncomfortable to watch and then
you realize the Clark Gable guy like I 

211
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,220
don't know what ethnicity he is.
He,

212
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,650
he was like from Glendale or something 
like that.

213
00:09:16,651 --> 00:09:18,870
Like I never thought this was supposed 
to be like this,

214
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:20,190
like,
like handsome,

215
00:09:20,191 --> 00:09:21,660
striking young man.
But he looked like somebody.

216
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,430
This guy.
Like he,

217
00:09:23,431 --> 00:09:24,450
he,
it was weird.

218
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:28,290
What do you mean?
Like he didn't look like a leading man.

219
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:33,350
So like you're used to like the rock say
like a big manly hands had this guy 

220
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:37,960
looked like a little rocket.
The rocket will know you're talking 

221
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,310
about he racially,
he looked,

222
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:43,370
he looked.
He just like for back then it seemed 

223
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:44,370
like such a racist movie then.
Then they had like,

224
00:09:44,371 --> 00:09:45,960
they would have gone after him now.
Yeah.

225
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:48,540
It would have felt like a little Mexican
looking dude.

226
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:50,760
Yeah.
Like one of those standard Mexicans like

227
00:09:50,761 --> 00:09:52,170
Oscar de la Hoya,
Mexicans,

228
00:09:52,171 --> 00:09:57,171
maybe it was stolen,
but gone with the wind I thought was a 

229
00:09:57,171 --> 00:09:57,171
creepy ass movie.

230
00:09:57,171 --> 00:09:58,470
So that's the,
the woman who won the,

231
00:09:58,471 --> 00:10:01,770
uh,
the academy award for it yet for playing

232
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,240
a maid.
And by the way,

233
00:10:03,241 --> 00:10:08,241
she was the best person in the movie.
That chick I could fucking watch all 

234
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:08,241
day.
She was hilarious.

235
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:08,350
But,
uh,

236
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:13,460
the,
the whole thing though is so creepy 

237
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,100
because now they have the intermissions 
and the opening sound.

238
00:10:14,101 --> 00:10:19,101
What used to play in the movie theater,
sitting there for 15 minutes in the 

239
00:10:19,101 --> 00:10:21,000
middle of the making about listening to 
piano music,

240
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:26,030
thinking about racism winds like what is
the plot of them who wins?

241
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,440
You know what?
I was just so fascinated with the racism

242
00:10:31,441 --> 00:10:33,120
that I don't even remember what the plot
was.

243
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:33,960
Shit,
man.

244
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,880
It was freaking me out.
The video,

245
00:10:35,881 --> 00:10:39,470
the image of the black boy fanning.
Oh,

246
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:44,780
it's creeped and there's so many little 
things like that in the movie put to 

247
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:45,150
wizard of Oz feeling to it.

248
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:47,940
Now,
do you think that this movie is supposed

249
00:10:47,941 --> 00:10:52,941
to reflect the genuine racism of the era
that it was depicting or 39.

250
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:58,611
So it wasn't even.
There were still people alive from that 

251
00:10:58,611 --> 00:10:59,490
time.
Like when was 39?

252
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,770
Yeah.
Wow.

253
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,910
It was the first color movie,
I believe that.

254
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,680
Or one of the first color movies.
Yeah.

255
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:05,670
Wow.
Yeah.

256
00:11:05,671 --> 00:11:07,350
I think it might've been the,
the first.

257
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,490
Uh,
but,

258
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,420
but the.
Yeah,

259
00:11:09,421 --> 00:11:14,421
I don't,
I think that it was so it's not like it 

260
00:11:14,421 --> 00:11:14,421
was made in [inaudible] 78 and they were
taking like,

261
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:17,850
there were still black people still 
couldn't vote when the movie came out.

262
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,320
They didn't have to fan you anymore to 
drink it,

263
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:27,180
but they couldn't afford for vote.
Wow.

264
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,070
Yeah.
Old Movies,

265
00:11:29,071 --> 00:11:32,600
man,
old movies will trip you out or other.

266
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:35,210
There's a,
there's a,

267
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:40,400
the in the godfather,
someone goes let's sell drugs in their 

268
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:40,680
neighborhood,
their animals.

269
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:45,680
Anyway.
And I remember seeing that and going 

270
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,151
like,
that's a little rough like as an adult 

271
00:11:47,151 --> 00:11:49,140
probably 20 going like maybe cut that 
out.

272
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:54,380
Like Mooney always makes the joke that 
like the fact that they aired on 

273
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,381
television pretty irresponsible or is 
this sort of like fucked up Dave and 

274
00:11:58,271 --> 00:12:03,271
introduced that idea that there's 
anybody that would listen to that guy 

275
00:12:03,271 --> 00:12:05,690
and think he was making sense.
It's dangerous.

276
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:09,040
It's.
Are you talking about Mooney or the guy?

277
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,940
The Guy Saying that and the Godfather?
Yeah,

278
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:16,240
it's messy.
If you're a little black child and you 

279
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:16,240
have to fucking listen to that now,
do you think they should cgi,

280
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:19,570
they should eat that gun out of all 
these movies.

281
00:12:19,571 --> 00:12:23,740
Do you think they should.
CGI that did was create a work

282
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:28,810
for.
And then work of art reflects a honest 

283
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:29,150
behavior,
but when you put it on television,

284
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:32,430
it's a very tricky thing and if you're 
going to hear that on tbs,

285
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:36,650
I wonder if they.
I wonder if they,

286
00:12:36,651 --> 00:12:37,700
uh,
if they,

287
00:12:37,701 --> 00:12:39,230
if it went in there is on television.

288
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:42,250
Well,
I don't endorse them censoring it,

289
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:47,490
but I don't get to see where people 
would not want their kids to be exposed 

290
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:49,780
to certain things that are in certain 
movies more than Jackson.

291
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,370
If you could just flip through the 
channels,

292
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:52,720
you know,
it's easy to get to something.

293
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,760
What was the first moment you saw that 
you were like,

294
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:55,930
oh,
this isn't.

295
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:56,860
This is an adult.

296
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,580
My parents took me to a drive in and 
there was some Kung Fu movie.

297
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:04,180
I was a real little kid,
but I remember my mom being pissed off.

298
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:05,890
I got to say,
it doesn't surprise me.

299
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:11,190
It doesn't frighten me.
Like you little Joe Rogan and to come 

300
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:12,640
from like your parents get murdered.
My parents were crazy,

301
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:16,390
so and in the background your parents 
get murdered in your wife and the images

302
00:13:16,391 --> 00:13:19,900
of Kung Fu or fucking streaming and on 
your possible tyrants are going,

303
00:13:19,901 --> 00:13:21,880
Joe,
you have to avenge us.

304
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,770
And there was a girl who had a

305
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:27,260
in the movie,
she had marks on her chest,

306
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:31,280
like she got scratched and the guy said,
let me see what it looks like.

307
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:36,490
And so of course she pulls her whole top
off and I just remember my mom saying 

308
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:38,030
this because I was like fucking four 
years old or something.

309
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:40,600
But I remember her going.
She didn't have to take her.

310
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:40,900
Sure.

311
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:45,900
Dot that way,
like she was mad at how preposterous it 

312
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:51,541
was.
She didn't have to take her shirt off 

313
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:51,541
that there was another,
there was another route.

314
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:52,090
This is ridiculous.
That was.

315
00:13:52,091 --> 00:13:53,160
Yeah,
that was exploitative.

316
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:56,070
She could've just,
her being upset by that.

317
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,610
And what did your dad go like?
Well,

318
00:13:57,611 --> 00:13:59,710
let her finish.
Jennifer,

319
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:03,320
what was your mother?
I think her real name is a Santa.

320
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:04,450
Wasn't real.
Yeah,

321
00:14:04,451 --> 00:14:06,910
but she didn't like it.
So she went by the name of Susan.

322
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,340
She and I have something in common 
because I don't like it either.

323
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:12,220
A,
what does that mean?

324
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,420
I don't know.
I don't know if.

325
00:14:13,421 --> 00:14:15,010
No idea.
Some Italian name.

326
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:20,310
It does sound like an Italian.
A slang for blind people does it there,

327
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,550
but I don't,
I don't appreciate.

328
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:26,440
There's got to be a lot of them.
Uh,

329
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,830
how many days a week do you guys do the 
show to?

330
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:31,570
Most of the time.
And you're doing a podcast now yourself?

331
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,170
Yes,
I am.

332
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:34,260
I'm doing a podcast called,
uh,

333
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:36,150
the champs,
uh,

334
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,530
with me and Neal Brennan,
Moshe Kasher,

335
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:42,040
and I can't even dj doug pound who's 
from Tim and Eric.

336
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,920
And uh,
our angle is we have a,

337
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:50,310
we only have black guests because black 
people are so underrepresented and 

338
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,580
podcasts each crazy.

339
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,140
Yeah,
it's crazy,

340
00:14:54,141 --> 00:14:55,180
you know.
But like,

341
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,010
are you sure tyler was the only blind 
person?

342
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:01,100
Women and black people just don't.
It really is like,

343
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:04,670
they're behind on,
on podcasts in terms of popularity.

344
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:09,070
It's a lot of white men like Joe Rogan.
Um,

345
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:14,470
and so this week we've had a comics,
we had a jerrod Carmichael on who's 

346
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:16,040
really funny,
young guy and you know,

347
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:21,060
in words.
And then this week we have Blake 

348
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:23,080
Griffin,
the basketball player who is about as 

349
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,540
cool and funny a guy as you'll ever 
meet.

350
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,840
Like you can't believe it.
How cool and end.

351
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:32,690
He's legitimately funny.
Like we were texting one night I go,

352
00:15:32,691 --> 00:15:33,590
uh,
he,

353
00:15:33,591 --> 00:15:34,880
he was going to vegas and I go,
Hey,

354
00:15:34,881 --> 00:15:35,660
if you need,
um,

355
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:39,260
if you need a carrot top tickets,
kill yourself.

356
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:45,270
And he wrote back,
actually I just found out that carrot 

357
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:45,270
top killed himself.
And I,

358
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:45,500
and I wrote back,
oh,

359
00:15:45,501 --> 00:15:46,190
that's a shame.

360
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:49,430
Kind of put on one hell of a show.
And Blake wrote back,

361
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:52,130
flake wrote back,
I give them props,

362
00:15:52,131 --> 00:15:55,040
but the fucking guy used them all,
which is like,

363
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:59,720
that's a pretty good joke for a 22 year 
old dunk champion.

364
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:05,020
But that's maybe not even the best exit.
He's just a really funny dude and 

365
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:05,780
incredibly nice.
Like we had,

366
00:16:05,781 --> 00:16:10,781
um,
we did a podcast in my house and he was 

367
00:16:10,781 --> 00:16:10,781
drinking.
He brought up,

368
00:16:10,781 --> 00:16:15,610
he had a bottle of water and then he,
he finished that and then he refilled it

369
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:19,340
in the,
in the tap,

370
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,390
in my kitchen sink was used to the 
locker room on it I guess.

371
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,700
But it was just very like impressed by 
like,

372
00:16:25,701 --> 00:16:28,710
how are you not a Dick?
I kept asking him,

373
00:16:28,711 --> 00:16:31,850
how are you known a Dick?
And he never told me no,

374
00:16:31,851 --> 00:16:32,780
but he's like,
he,

375
00:16:32,781 --> 00:16:33,230
yeah,
he's,

376
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:35,720
he's got one car,
he rents his house.

377
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:40,750
Like he's just a smart.
It's kind of an interesting situation 

378
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:44,690
with a lot of athletes is a lot of 
athletes that just did not nice people.

379
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,210
It's like part of getting good at the 
sport means kind of.

380
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,670
Well that's what we were talking about 
is being.

381
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,200
And you could talk,
we get,

382
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:56,220
this would actually be an interesting 
thing because I would like to make a 

383
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,700
legit documentary about this competition
in America,

384
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,410
uh,
in that.

385
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:03,950
Because like coby Brian is too 
competitive.

386
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:07,130
Michael Jordan is too competitive to the
point where it's like,

387
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:10,550
dude,
I don't look like I'm all for winning.

388
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,770
I'm all for.
But you clearly are something is there's

389
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:19,830
like a switch.
And I was talking to another NBA player 

390
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:23,471
who's,
who's a big star and I won't say his 

391
00:17:23,471 --> 00:17:23,471
name [inaudible].
I go,

392
00:17:23,471 --> 00:17:23,471
I go man.
And Colby is a,

393
00:17:23,471 --> 00:17:24,110
he's too competitive.
And he's like,

394
00:17:24,111 --> 00:17:24,620
well,
you know,

395
00:17:24,621 --> 00:17:25,250
man,
it's this,

396
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,330
you know,
you get in the game.

397
00:17:26,331 --> 00:17:27,500
I go,
he's too competitive.

398
00:17:27,501 --> 00:17:28,400
He is,
I know.

399
00:17:28,401 --> 00:17:30,830
And tell them that all the time because 
like he,

400
00:17:30,831 --> 00:17:33,980
it's like sort of weird to people when 
you're,

401
00:17:33,981 --> 00:17:36,860
that how they get so good though.

402
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:41,880
Absolutely.
Mike,

403
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,670
Mike Koby Bryant,
Michael Jordan,

404
00:17:43,671 --> 00:17:46,880
guys like that are Michael Jordan is an 
incredible athlete.

405
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:52,270
And you pair that with this crazy spirit
and you get Michael Jordan.

406
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,810
But what I'm saying is at what point is 
it too much?

407
00:17:57,811 --> 00:18:01,260
Where it's like you deal with mma,
I think about it in comedy,

408
00:18:01,261 --> 00:18:04,140
guys knocking each other out of the way.
It's like,

409
00:18:04,141 --> 00:18:09,141
what are we getting at?
Because all every study of human 

410
00:18:09,141 --> 00:18:13,401
happiness,
and particularly there's a lot of 

411
00:18:13,401 --> 00:18:15,141
sociological studies coming out in the 
last five to 10 years say that people 

412
00:18:15,141 --> 00:18:17,640
don't get any happier beyond a certain,
a financial point.

413
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:20,100
They don't get any happier,
uh,

414
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,930
with possessions.
They don't,

415
00:18:21,931 --> 00:18:22,860
you know what I mean?
So it's like,

416
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:25,440
what are we,
what's the point?

417
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:30,740
It's also now it's like cap.
This is the first time in my life where 

418
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,280
I've ever thought like,
capitalism isn't so great.

419
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,830
You know what I mean?
Where it's finally falling apart,

420
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:35,520
where you kind of go,

421
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:36,830
well,
all right,

422
00:18:36,831 --> 00:18:39,860
let's see what happens.
I think it's not perfect,

423
00:18:39,861 --> 00:18:42,020
but I think the idea of,
you know,

424
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:45,950
you're working your merit and your 
ability to maneuver your way through the

425
00:18:45,951 --> 00:18:50,000
system counts up to something.
The more effort you put in,

426
00:18:50,001 --> 00:18:55,001
the more reward you get back.
I agree with the idea of capitalism and 

427
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:55,460
that went.
But when you,

428
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:58,370
when you get involved in the system that
we have now with,

429
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:01,100
with some just the stock market alone,
like,

430
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:06,490
and trading.
And what did you short on this article 

431
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:06,490
the other day?
It was brilliant and he said,

432
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:09,130
because I've had to tell people that,
haven't read it.

433
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,820
It was in the Sunday,
New York Times.

434
00:19:10,821 --> 00:19:14,240
He basically more above it.
The third wealthiest man in the world or

435
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,810
America says,
Richard said,

436
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:16,060
fuck

437
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,830
he,
whatever.

438
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:21,280
He owns the company,
a five products in your house.

439
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:23,710
Um,
he basically said,

440
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:25,150
look,
we,

441
00:19:25,151 --> 00:19:28,270
I weed people rich people like me have 
super rich,

442
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:31,360
don't get taxed enough.
We used to get tax way more.

443
00:19:31,361 --> 00:19:32,410
And I've had this argument,
but you know,

444
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:37,440
how Republicans thought,
we say a tax cuts lead to an improvement

445
00:19:38,321 --> 00:19:39,430
in the economy.
And I,

446
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:44,520
in the back of my head,
I've had this argument that a sacrament 

447
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,771
with Vince Vaughn one time about that 
people don't get into business if taxes 

448
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:54,300
on doing standup comedy.
We're a 70 percent and not 40 percent.

449
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:58,630
I would still do standup comedy.
Do you know what I mean?

450
00:19:58,631 --> 00:20:03,631
I'm not doing it for a bit.
I think people start their own business 

451
00:20:03,701 --> 00:20:06,760
because they don't like working for 
other people and they,

452
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:11,840
um,
and they have an idea that they want to 

453
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,880
create by themselves and I don't think 
it comes down to I'm not going to do it 

454
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,820
because taxes are too high.

455
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:19,300
And Warren Buffett made that point that 
capital gains tax,

456
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:20,550
meaning gay,
uh,

457
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:24,250
uh,
taxes on money you make in profit on the

458
00:20:24,251 --> 00:20:25,600
stock market.
Like if you make,

459
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:29,200
if you invest 100 grand and then you 
make 15 grand off of it,

460
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:32,650
uh,
they will tax the 15 grand at.

461
00:20:32,651 --> 00:20:37,030
Now it's really low.
It's like 11 percent if that.

462
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:40,600
And Warren Buffet said it used to be 29 
and he said,

463
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:44,360
and everyone invested just as much.
So I,

464
00:20:44,361 --> 00:20:48,360
I reject the idea that,
that we all liked this,

465
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,760
that taxes,
that even socialism,

466
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:56,080
I think you would do the exact same shit
in a socialist country.

467
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,980
I think you would,
if they paid you to host fear factor and

468
00:20:59,981 --> 00:21:01,930
a podcast and news radio and all this 
shit.

469
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:04,510
If you did the same,
if you,

470
00:21:04,511 --> 00:21:07,180
if we all got paid relatively the same 
amount of money,

471
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:12,040
I believe that I believe that I do what 
I do because I'm compelled to do it,

472
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:17,310
not because of the money.
Now I'm not saying everyone's an artist 

473
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:17,860
or everyone's a writer,
a comedian or whatever,

474
00:21:17,861 --> 00:21:20,350
but I'm,
I'm of the mind that,

475
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:22,150
that people.

476
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:23,290
So you,
uh,

477
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:26,500
you're almost advocating everyone 
getting paid the same amount.

478
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:28,550
Uh,
I don't.

479
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:33,080
Here's what I'm advocating.
I'm advocating that the,

480
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:36,880
we live in a country where people,
art,

481
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:41,890
people die because they're poor and I 
think a lot of Republicans or right wing

482
00:21:42,411 --> 00:21:47,411
people think that,
that the reason they're poor is because 

483
00:21:47,411 --> 00:21:49,640
they didn't work hard enough.
And that's simply not the case.

484
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:52,940
A lot of times I think people,
I think a lot of people on the right are

485
00:21:52,941 --> 00:21:55,400
born on third base and think they hit a 
triple.

486
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:58,290
You're born into this career.
You know what?

487
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,170
That's an old phrase,
but yet it's,

488
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:05,200
it's,
you're born into this life and then you 

489
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,811
go because you don't.
It's like when Barbara Bush said during 

490
00:22:07,811 --> 00:22:07,970
Katrina,
Hurricane Katrina,

491
00:22:07,971 --> 00:22:11,150
she goes about the people in the 
superdome.

492
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:13,400
She goes,
some of those people have never lived so

493
00:22:13,401 --> 00:22:18,401
well.
It's like you fucking cunt for you to 

494
00:22:18,401 --> 00:22:18,401
say yes.
She actually said that.

495
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,930
Um,
so,

496
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:21,840
so the idea that people will,
they,

497
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:26,870
they just believe that people in rich 
white people couldn't believe that there

498
00:22:27,261 --> 00:22:31,370
were people in America that didn't have 
cars when they said they would go,

499
00:22:31,371 --> 00:22:36,371
well,
the mayor told them to get out of town 

500
00:22:36,371 --> 00:22:36,371
and drive out into town and they're 
like,

501
00:22:36,371 --> 00:22:37,580
they didn't have cars and there were no 
buses.

502
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:40,550
The buses stopped at a certain point.
Um,

503
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:43,220
so just the idea that people are dying.
Uh,

504
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:45,830
and then we get into this thing of like 
American's best isn't,

505
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,870
uh,
a lot.

506
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,740
Most of the people that say America's 
best system in the world don't know what

507
00:22:50,741 --> 00:22:53,870
the other systems and also the idea of 
like socialized medicine.

508
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:57,970
Why wouldn't you want to help save 
people's lives like I,

509
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:03,100
you know,
I think the idea behind it is that it 

510
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:03,570
doesn't encourage competition amongst 
doctors,

511
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:04,980
doctors.
So doctors,

512
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,170
if they're only going to get paid a 
certain amount of money,

513
00:23:07,171 --> 00:23:10,170
no matter what,
they have no incentive to be excellent.

514
00:23:10,171 --> 00:23:14,460
But that goes back to my point.
I think most people that are doctors are

515
00:23:14,461 --> 00:23:18,690
compelled to be Dr,
but I don't think it's either or.

516
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:21,440
You don't think that a doctor is 
compelled to be a doctor.

517
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:26,460
He enjoys it,
but works even harder because he gets 

518
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,310
financial compensation for his work.
I think personally,

519
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:29,300
I personally

520
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:34,350
don't because I think that people that 
are driven are not driven by a financial

521
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:36,500
renew.

522
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:41,650
Right?
But you don't think it enhances things 

523
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:43,511
is even if they're not driven by it,
even if they would be doing it happily 

524
00:23:43,511 --> 00:23:45,050
for a peasant's wage because they love 
the art,

525
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:46,250
whatever the fuck they're doing,

526
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:49,880
you don't think that it makes them 
really push it and have it sometimes and

527
00:23:49,881 --> 00:23:52,200
not slack off when there's money on 
online?

528
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:53,690
Uh,
yes,

529
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:54,400
I think,
yeah,

530
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:57,110
to give people money makes me have 
productive.

531
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,130
Uh,
yes.

532
00:23:59,131 --> 00:24:04,131
But I guess the point is why are we so 
compelled to be productive?

533
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:06,300
It's like where they go,
they go,

534
00:24:06,301 --> 00:24:11,301
man,
France fucking only works 35 hour work 

535
00:24:11,301 --> 00:24:11,400
week and we get an image in our head of 
like,

536
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,860
that's faggy a 35 hour work week.
What are you affect it?

537
00:24:15,861 --> 00:24:20,861
No,
they're having a good life like we 

538
00:24:20,861 --> 00:24:23,331
don't,
but we've these systems and the images 

539
00:24:23,331 --> 00:24:25,901
and the and the,
the cultural norms are such an America 

540
00:24:25,901 --> 00:24:28,961
that we just go with fucking.
I wouldn't be caught dead only working 

541
00:24:28,961 --> 00:24:29,300
30 about why,
why,

542
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,350
why do you?
Why?

543
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:35,380
Why do we all have this need to like,
I'm going to fucking work and I got to 

544
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:38,081
generate and I got to make fucking.
I got to trick people into wanting to 

545
00:24:38,081 --> 00:24:42,431
buy shit that I'm doing so that I can 
get money and then buy shit that I had 

546
00:24:42,431 --> 00:24:43,890
been tricked into that I don't need.
I don't need any of this.

547
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:48,950
This is a song that I've been bouncing 
around forever and my conclusion and I 

548
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:54,100
don't have a real conclusion,
but what I always believe is that it 

549
00:24:54,801 --> 00:24:58,970
seems that everything in nature operates
in some sort of a natural system that we

550
00:24:58,971 --> 00:24:59,510
accept.

551
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,020
Whether it's salmon going up river,
there's bizarre things,

552
00:25:03,021 --> 00:25:08,021
you know,
they're going up river and throwing 

553
00:25:08,021 --> 00:25:08,021
themselves on the rocks and it happens 
every year.

554
00:25:08,021 --> 00:25:10,370
It's just a cycle and it's put in place 
for a reason.

555
00:25:10,371 --> 00:25:12,780
It's put in place to make sure that only
bad motherfucker,

556
00:25:12,781 --> 00:25:17,781
salmon get to breed.
You've got to be the baddest 

557
00:25:17,781 --> 00:25:20,741
motherfucker to make it up that river.
And I think that that is the same thing 

558
00:25:20,741 --> 00:25:25,391
with human beings.
I think we are a part of a natural 

559
00:25:25,391 --> 00:25:28,241
system too,
but we're the apex of the natural 

560
00:25:28,241 --> 00:25:29,330
systems and we're so super complex that 
we don't even understand our motivations

561
00:25:29,331 --> 00:25:34,331
for things.
We don't understand that this drive and 

562
00:25:34,331 --> 00:25:34,331
this,
you know,

563
00:25:34,331 --> 00:25:37,100
all our ideas of personal gain really 
aren't about personal gain.

564
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:42,130
It's about enhancing the amount of money
that goes into this system that makes 

565
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:42,370
things and innovate.
It's.

566
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:47,590
That's what it really is all about.
It has nothing to do with you or I all 

567
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:51,101
of our wants and needs and loves for 
material possessions and all the things 

568
00:25:51,101 --> 00:25:54,401
that comes with it.
Those that all that is doing is somehow 

569
00:25:54,401 --> 00:25:55,040
or another pushing innovation,
pushing you.

570
00:25:55,041 --> 00:25:59,210
Keeping up with the Jones' is pushing 
some sort of a technological singularity

571
00:25:59,211 --> 00:26:01,260
that we're pushing towards said

572
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:04,350
that,
do we not attended?

573
00:26:04,351 --> 00:26:08,190
We just let it is I guess on 
productivity as this,

574
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:11,760
as this,
as this high high.

575
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:14,260
That's the ultimate goal.
Just seems like no,

576
00:26:14,261 --> 00:26:17,430
it is ridiculous for the fucking people 
who own the company,

577
00:26:17,431 --> 00:26:19,260
but it's not.
It's middle.

578
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:24,290
Like the middle class is gone now 
because it's because we've all been 

579
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:28,011
tricked into thinking like,
like these people that provide jobs are 

580
00:26:28,011 --> 00:26:31,000
these fucking messiahs the particularly 
in the last year and a half of like,

581
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,480
what about the jobs?
What about the jobs so that they go,

582
00:26:33,481 --> 00:26:34,890
well,
we don't want to hurt.

583
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:38,220
We don't want to tax people like Warren 
Buffet because they provide jobs.

584
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:43,340
Actually most jobs in America,
I think 60 percent of America are from 

585
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:43,340
small businesses,
um,

586
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:49,130
now having.
So I guess it's just the idea of in 

587
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:52,140
they're starting to study like a gross 
national happiness.

588
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:54,700
Um,
and I,

589
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:59,790
and,
and a lot of it is not contingent upon 

590
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:02,790
capitalism and productivity and I.

591
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:07,790
because now I feel like people are so 
drunk on productivity and getting these 

592
00:27:08,281 --> 00:27:11,610
possessions that they are,
have less time for the kids.

593
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:15,060
They get to work two jobs,
they got an.

594
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:20,080
It just seems like it,
it just seems like we're at a breaking 

595
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:20,490
point in terms of like,
uh,

596
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,320
I don't,
I don't know if it'll happen,

597
00:27:22,321 --> 00:27:27,321
but I,
I wish there was some amount of 

598
00:27:27,321 --> 00:27:27,760
consideration from people.
Uh,

599
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:28,320
I,
I,

600
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:30,870
and having said that I enjoy a hard 
day's work.

601
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,960
I enjoy like him.
But what I like about it is I like the 

602
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,410
personal interaction.
That's what I've always loved about work

603
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:41,550
is the personal connection you have with
people and like feeling like we're doing

604
00:27:41,551 --> 00:27:43,920
this thing together that I'm completely 
for,

605
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,830
but it's,
you know,

606
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:50,860
it's like the money part I just find not
negligible because I think it's 

607
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,140
important to make a living all that 
stuff.

608
00:27:52,141 --> 00:27:53,970
But,
but I just feel like there's too much of

609
00:27:53,971 --> 00:27:58,971
a premium put on productivity and 
getting pregnant.

610
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:01,210
There are.
But you know what?

611
00:28:01,211 --> 00:28:04,060
I love having an.
I love having a laptop.

612
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:09,180
I think it's awesome.
I really liked being able to go buy a 

613
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:09,180
cellphone.
I love it.

614
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:12,991
I love being able to get a car.
I'm not making any of these things and 

615
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:12,991
neither are you,
right?

616
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:15,760
You don't know to live this life this 
way.

617
00:28:15,761 --> 00:28:18,620
We need somebody to make shit and you 
know,

618
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,350
no one's saying that should be,
you know,

619
00:28:20,351 --> 00:28:21,120
I understand that,
but

620
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:24,970
that doesn't necessarily preclude that.
It couldn't have happened in another,

621
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:28,570
in another financial system or arc or 
like as,

622
00:28:28,571 --> 00:28:30,550
as the guy on the Internet the other day
said,

623
00:28:30,551 --> 00:28:34,000
a felonious monk is the guy's name,
but he put up,

624
00:28:34,001 --> 00:28:35,470
posted a youtube video that got a lot of
love.

625
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:37,180
He said a black dude.
He goes,

626
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:41,080
how can you,
how am I going to say that capitalism is

627
00:28:41,081 --> 00:28:46,081
the best system in the world when we owe
billions of dollars to a communist 

628
00:28:46,081 --> 00:28:46,540
country.
You know what I mean?

629
00:28:46,541 --> 00:28:47,780
We just like [inaudible].
America is like,

630
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:49,750
this is best.
Okay,

631
00:28:49,751 --> 00:28:50,680
well,
why don't we eat.

632
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:54,550
Their system is clearly beating as a 
communist.

633
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,490
Uh,
they're there.

634
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:58,900
It's like a communist with a soft 
capitalism.

635
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:03,030
I don't even know how you described the 
Chinese Chinese a financial.

636
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:08,360
I don't know enough about our financial 
system to even comment on it and when I 

637
00:29:08,431 --> 00:29:11,560
say things I'm usually wrong as far as 
like numbers and.

638
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:12,190
No,
I'm,

639
00:29:12,191 --> 00:29:17,191
I'm.
That's the thing about all this shit is 

640
00:29:17,191 --> 00:29:17,191
no one under all the fucking.
They don't know.

641
00:29:17,191 --> 00:29:18,480
They know that.
That fucking.

642
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,880
What's his name guy?
The ponzi scheme guy.

643
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:22,410
What's his name?
Bernie madoff already made off.

644
00:29:22,411 --> 00:29:27,411
It would never been able to get away 
with that if they all knew that that is 

645
00:29:27,411 --> 00:29:30,231
the best proof of this is some crazy 
fucking get.

646
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,370
So when people go,
when people go,

647
00:29:32,371 --> 00:29:37,371
well,
I don't think that we should have done 

648
00:29:37,371 --> 00:29:37,371
the bailout and why don't think it's 
like,

649
00:29:37,371 --> 00:29:37,371
yeah.

650
00:29:37,371 --> 00:29:42,050
In a perfect world,
Matt Taibbi wrote a book called Grip 

651
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:42,940
Toby,
which is fucking excellent book.

652
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,310
I love that dude.
A.

653
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:46,300
The book is really,
really good.

654
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:49,060
I love the rolling stone articles.
He was the guy who.

655
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:51,970
He broke the Goldman Sachs article 
because he was on.

656
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,610
How is he still alive?
I know.

657
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:58,650
Well,
that's proof that there is no 

658
00:29:58,650 --> 00:29:58,650
illuminati.
If you needed any more for,

659
00:29:58,650 --> 00:29:59,820
but that's the only shred of proof,
that mentality.

660
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:01,240
There's a lot.
Um,

661
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,500
the,
uh,

662
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:07,680
the he was on,
he was in the press pool on I believe 

663
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:11,341
Obama's or Mccain's campaign for 
president and they were all talking 

664
00:30:12,941 --> 00:30:14,390
about the,
you know,

665
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:16,860
the bailout and the all that,
this,

666
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:21,870
the tarp and all that shit.
And he was with all the correspondence 

667
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:22,000
and he goes,
does any,

668
00:30:22,001 --> 00:30:26,620
do any of us know what top is?
And none of them did.

669
00:30:26,621 --> 00:30:30,190
And he was like,
I have to study,

670
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:35,220
I have to write about this shit because 
we're the ones who are supposed to know 

671
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,100
and we don't fucking know.
And he said,

672
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:41,370
and he said,
the amount of work it takes to even 

673
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:41,370
understand it.
He's like,

674
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:41,370
it was,
it was,

675
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:43,510
it was pitifully boring,
uh,

676
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:46,540
how much shit he had to do to even begin
to understand it.

677
00:30:46,541 --> 00:30:48,220
And his point about tea party people 
was,

678
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:53,470
they,
what they long for is simplicity.

679
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:56,410
And that shit is over some financials.

680
00:30:57,060 --> 00:31:02,060
It's not just financial simplicity,
but I think the whole idea of calling 

681
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:02,250
themselves the tea party,
I mean they,

682
00:31:02,251 --> 00:31:03,360
they,
they are actually,

683
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:08,130
they're reinvigorating memories of the 
original Boston Tea Party.

684
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:09,330
No,
absolutely.

685
00:31:09,331 --> 00:31:10,800
But,
but having said that,

686
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:15,910
it wasn't.
The Boston tea party was about taxation 

687
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:18,791
without representation and this is about
complex financial instruments and the 

688
00:31:18,801 --> 00:31:23,150
interconnectivity of the global 
financial system.

689
00:31:23,151 --> 00:31:26,130
It's like you can't,
they don't know what a fucking uh,

690
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:29,780
uh,
reverse mortgage,

691
00:31:29,781 --> 00:31:30,200
all that shit

692
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:32,470
that you just go.
I don't know what the fuck.

693
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:35,290
I don't know.
I'm a relatively intelligent guy.

694
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:40,620
I have and my dad was a tax attorney.
I don't understand any of this shit.

695
00:31:40,681 --> 00:31:44,440
And you try to look at like leveraged 
mortgage and shorting.

696
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:45,710
Yeah.
You look at talent.

697
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,190
Try to figure that out.
I,

698
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,570
yeah.
Shorting.

699
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:50,960
I could explain relatively [inaudible] 
like,

700
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:51,850
but,
but the,

701
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:56,860
uh,
what about that dude that shorted the 

702
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,801
economy that there was some,
some gigantic wage have made that the 

703
00:31:58,801 --> 00:32:03,601
economy that are American economy's 
going to lose its AAA standard or 

704
00:32:03,601 --> 00:32:04,420
whatever it be making millions of 
dollars.

705
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:09,600
Yeah.
Some guy made a fuckload of money when 

706
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:09,600
our credit rating dropped.
Yeah,

707
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,510
that is correct.
But again,

708
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,880
you wouldn't even try to explain that to
somebody in the tea party.

709
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:18,820
Try to explain that to a fucking 
intelligent person.

710
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:19,740
Try.
Explain.

711
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:20,780
So anyway,
so yeah,

712
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,260
so,
so they're trying to.

713
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:22,540
So

714
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:23,720
they're trying to,
uh,

715
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:27,310
they long for this simplicity of like,
I don't,

716
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:29,530
I believe that there should you believe 
in,

717
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,420
in corporate socialism,
but you're like,

718
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:35,120
fuck you if you're dying.
But if a corporation is even as like a,

719
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:40,400
a graze,
like a flesh wound here comes everyone 

720
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:44,830
to like,
we got to help the corporations because 

721
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:47,411
they provide jobs like you motherfuckers
are buying into this thing of it's the 

722
00:32:47,411 --> 00:32:48,800
deification of corporations.

723
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:51,250
Well,
if you ever watched that documentary,

724
00:32:51,251 --> 00:32:52,240
the corporation.
No.

725
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,070
Yeah,
that's an amazing piece of work.

726
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:59,490
It really gets you thinking of how the.
It's actually set up and the way it's 

727
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:01,630
set up.
No one feels like they're doing anything

728
00:33:01,631 --> 00:33:03,700
badly even though bad things are getting
done

729
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:07,980
it.
You can't be a corporation without being

730
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,190
fucking dastardly.
You eat.

731
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:12,210
You have to,
the way the system instead of,

732
00:33:12,211 --> 00:33:13,620
and this goes back to my,
my,

733
00:33:13,621 --> 00:33:15,300
uh,
my capitalism argument,

734
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:20,480
the way the system is set up,
if these corporations profits don't 

735
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:24,270
increase every 12 weeks,
their stock price goes down.

736
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:29,690
So how do you make profits increase?
Either fucking expand your market or cut

737
00:33:31,261 --> 00:33:32,500
workers,
so.

738
00:33:32,501 --> 00:33:37,501
So they cut orders is a fucked up thing 
to do and expanding markets is a pretty 

739
00:33:37,921 --> 00:33:40,620
dastardly business to uh,
so.

740
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:44,070
So they're not the only way you survive 
in these.

741
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:47,550
I remember when me and a Chappelle,
we're having stuff with,

742
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:50,390
with comedy central,
a lot of stuff and I go get that.

743
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:54,060
That's not their viacom for a reason.
Like they're just,

744
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,580
that's what they fucking,
they who,

745
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:01,680
how can we get there?
They're hungry machines that are built 

746
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:05,220
to hoard money and fuck people over.

747
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:10,850
Well,
when you get into negotiations with 

748
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:10,850
anyone about anything and you start 
really realizing,

749
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,590
oh yeah,
this is where it is.

750
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:15,870
How was your a fear factor?
Negotiation was.

751
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,610
It wasn't gross.
It was easy.

752
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:20,040
It was easy.
There were nice,

753
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:23,880
great.
Well luckily I did it for 148 episodes,

754
00:34:23,881 --> 00:34:28,881
so they knew I could do it.
I didn't know I was going to have to 

755
00:34:28,881 --> 00:34:33,861
audition for it and I was like,
you better not make me audition for our 

756
00:34:33,861 --> 00:34:33,861
jobs.
Stupid.

757
00:34:33,861 --> 00:34:35,700
They were always kind of weird with that
show because it did so good.

758
00:34:35,701 --> 00:34:38,520
Like I think it stayed on NBC website 
the whole time.

759
00:34:38,521 --> 00:34:41,070
It was off the air.
Like you could still go to the show page

760
00:34:41,071 --> 00:34:44,190
for fear factor and it was kind of odd.
That was the only show that you could do

761
00:34:44,191 --> 00:34:45,070
that with?
Well,

762
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:50,150
I don't think it was ever officially 
cancel and I think we just stopped 

763
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:50,150
production.
Who was weird because it never liked.

764
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:53,520
Got horrible ratings.
They all die off a little bit,

765
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,040
but it never had.
It never was horrible.

766
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:58,620
It was just.
We had done a syndicated version.

767
00:34:58,621 --> 00:35:00,870
Are you guys 148 was enough to 
syndicate.

768
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:02,530
Oh,
it was 100 more than enough syndicates.

769
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:04,320
They syndicates most shows at 100.

770
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:05,200
No,
absolutely.

771
00:35:05,201 --> 00:35:10,201
But I'm saying did you.
But it's like a who wants to be a 

772
00:35:10,201 --> 00:35:10,201
millionaire?
Like they,

773
00:35:10,201 --> 00:35:10,210
they,
they,

774
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:15,240
they stripped it,
stopped doing it prime time and then 

775
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:15,240
they did they ever.

776
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:15,240
No,
no,

777
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:15,490
no,
I didn't do that.

778
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:20,520
Well that would be the budget of fear 
factor is really high when you factor in

779
00:35:20,621 --> 00:35:25,621
some of the crazy fucking stents these 
people have to do and they're big this 

780
00:35:25,621 --> 00:35:25,621
year,
man.

781
00:35:25,621 --> 00:35:30,360
There's some nutty shit.
These fucking people have to do like 

782
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,240
some real real like were you like,
whoa.

783
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:33,140
Like this is fucking scary.
Let's.

784
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,590
This one's nuts.
I can't describe any of them.

785
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:37,470
It would be a,
it'd be a breach contract,

786
00:35:37,471 --> 00:35:38,040
but it's

787
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:43,040
bigger.
Like the stents are bigger and crazier 

788
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:43,040
than we've ever done it before.

789
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:43,040
You were ahead of your time jail by the 
way.

790
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:47,300
I wanted to say that you never wear 
makeup on any time you go on TV shows or

791
00:35:47,301 --> 00:35:52,301
if you're on shows and stuff like that.
He's always been the person where they 

792
00:35:52,301 --> 00:35:52,301
have to make a person come and just 
like,

793
00:35:52,301 --> 00:35:52,460
no,
I don't want any.

794
00:35:52,461 --> 00:35:53,710
And they're like,
well we're just going to give it up.

795
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,560
No,
I don't want any.

796
00:35:54,561 --> 00:35:59,561
You never get.
I was watching a show the other day 

797
00:35:59,561 --> 00:35:59,561
though,
where you can now with the hd,

798
00:35:59,561 --> 00:36:02,990
you could see the makeup,
the bad makeup jobs on all these people,

799
00:36:02,991 --> 00:36:05,090
and now I'm just imagining you with rosy
cheeks.

800
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:07,430
Yeah.
You had a skin thing though,

801
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:09,830
didn't you have the little Lego?
You can see it on my knuckles.

802
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:11,900
You had it on your face that would 
periods correct.

803
00:36:11,901 --> 00:36:12,800
Yeah,
but it goes away.

804
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,010
There's a stuff called protopic ointment
as long as you catch it,

805
00:36:16,011 --> 00:36:18,200
like right as it's coming out,
you can get it to go away,

806
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:23,570
but you've got to be real diligent about
your vitamins and stuff like that and 

807
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:23,750
wouldn't really shows.
It was like when I'm out in the sun,

808
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:24,730
you know,
got it.

809
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:29,770
Really shows them a speaking of vitamins
that wanted to talk about last time we 

810
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:30,980
were here,
we were talking about a hgh,

811
00:36:30,981 --> 00:36:32,900
all that stuff.
Um,

812
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:35,320
and a buddy of mine texted me and said,
[inaudible],

813
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:37,760
you were saying that there's basically 
no side effects,

814
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:39,500
etc.
Not say there's no sound.

815
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,150
It's relatively safe if you're doiNg it 
under a doctor's supervision.

816
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:45,020
Right.
You're smart about it.

817
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:46,970
Uh,
and my buddy texted me and said,

818
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:48,560
uh,
what about,

819
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:54,130
what about like cancerous cells?
It will accelerate the growth of any 

820
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:54,380
kind of self.
There's no evidence,

821
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:56,720
there's no evidence that it supports 
cancer growth,

822
00:36:57,050 --> 00:37:02,050
but there is evidence that if your 
body's immune system's down and you're 

823
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:02,990
not healthy than cancer can grow in your
bodies easier,

824
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:08,430
right?
If you have your overall system is 

825
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:09,200
operating more efficiently because of 
hormones that you've introduced to it or

826
00:37:09,201 --> 00:37:13,190
because of vitamins and supplements,
if your system is working better,

827
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:15,080
you're going to be able to fight things 
off better.

828
00:37:15,081 --> 00:37:20,081
It's really that simple.
If you take a holistic approach to the 

829
00:37:20,081 --> 00:37:20,081
human body,
you know,

830
00:37:20,081 --> 00:37:20,170
cancer is a very,
very,

831
00:37:20,171 --> 00:37:25,171
uh,
tricky mystery of the human body as to 

832
00:37:25,171 --> 00:37:27,971
why it exists in the first place.
But a lot of people believe that 

833
00:37:27,971 --> 00:37:29,930
anything,
any ailment that at least part of it has

834
00:37:29,931 --> 00:37:33,800
to do with how you feel,
what kind of energy you have,

835
00:37:33,801 --> 00:37:36,470
how much work you have to put in every 
day.

836
00:37:36,471 --> 00:37:41,471
How happy are you?
And the idea is how much does the whole 

837
00:37:41,471 --> 00:37:45,150
system are you?
How much money did you make last 

838
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:48,461
quarter?
That doesn't protect you from cancer 

839
00:37:48,461 --> 00:37:48,461
fella.
Wait,

840
00:37:48,461 --> 00:37:49,520
what?
But that's what they would have.

841
00:37:49,521 --> 00:37:52,440
You believe that if you're.
Who are these day,

842
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:57,720
I believe the exist in that world needed
to be an artist.

843
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:02,880
This is crazy.
It's like rejecting yourself in the 

844
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,350
proletariat to know.
But I see people.

845
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:06,860
nobody's more proletariat.
Then the kid,

846
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:10,280
the kid proletarian and he calls himself
the kid.

847
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:11,330
I liked to hang out with that guy.

848
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:12,740
The,
uh,

849
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:14,170
the,
uh,

850
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:18,680
I just think it's fucking disgusting.
I think when people are,

851
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:21,320
again,
it goes back to that you can be anything

852
00:38:21,321 --> 00:38:24,260
in this country.
You can be anything in this country.

853
00:38:24,261 --> 00:38:25,490
And they,
it's never.

854
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:27,250
You never hear it from when people go,
yeah,

855
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:29,660
you can be in this country.
Having said that,

856
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:32,120
if you're white,
if you're born into a,

857
00:38:32,121 --> 00:38:35,650
into a upper middle class white people 
or above,

858
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:39,370
it's way easier to be anything which 
they never said.

859
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:44,420
What's an unknown saying?
It's a level playing field and it's 

860
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:44,420
impossible to make it level.

861
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:45,620
They'Re is.
I agree,

862
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:50,680
but they're implying that it's level.
I think that the people on the upper 

863
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:51,830
crust believed that it's level goes bY,

864
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:57,910
did anybody believes it's level,
but I do think that they think it's a 

865
00:38:57,910 --> 00:38:58,400
better setup than India.
That's what I think.

866
00:38:58,401 --> 00:39:03,401
I think they believe that people here 
have more of a shot at living a real 

867
00:39:03,401 --> 00:39:03,401
life than France.
You know,

868
00:39:03,401 --> 00:39:04,880
there's people that have these ideals,

869
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:10,150
but you know what America is ranked in 
terms of class a jumping in the world.

870
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,800
14th.
Yeah.

871
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:17,480
Who's the number one who just fucking 
around eight might be India.

872
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:18,890
Really?
Yeah.

873
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:19,650
It's,
it's,

874
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:22,130
it's definitely not.
Um,

875
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:24,230
it's,
I don't think it's the uk.

876
00:39:24,231 --> 00:39:26,180
I don't think.
I think or it might be Germany,

877
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:28,190
Germany has got a really good economy 
but,

878
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:30,690
but uh,
in terms of like the german,

879
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:35,770
he was in the shitter right now to now 
they're the only ones that's not really 

880
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:35,770
not.
Yeah,

881
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:36,440
they've done better than anybody.

882
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,860
Some reason when we were over in Germany
doing a show,

883
00:39:38,861 --> 00:39:41,860
that's what our driver was saying.
Maybe he was just a whiner.

884
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:44,200
Uh,
yeah.

885
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:44,900
No.
So,

886
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:47,330
so the idea that America is the best you
can jump.

887
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,380
It's like,
yeah,

888
00:39:48,381 --> 00:39:51,010
first of all,
it's 14th in the world out of $200,

889
00:39:51,011 --> 00:39:54,170
which again is we made good,
but in terms of if you ask people,

890
00:39:54,171 --> 00:39:55,670
they'd all go,
we're number one.

891
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:57,300
Yeah.
You know why we're number one?

892
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:00,090
Because we had leonard's cantered.
We make muscle cars.

893
00:40:00,091 --> 00:40:03,630
We have some of the fucking best shit.
We designed some of the best shit.

894
00:40:03,631 --> 00:40:05,780
We invent some of the best shit.
Fucking van halen.

895
00:40:05,781 --> 00:40:08,250
There's a reason why we have the best 
comedians.

896
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:13,280
There's a reason why that's a fact.
Even though there's some good ones from 

897
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:13,830
other countries,
that's a fact.

898
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:17,300
Give us number one on shit that we 
deserve,

899
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:20,190
that we're actually number one on,
but we're not number when people are.

900
00:40:20,191 --> 00:40:21,090
You can be anything.
There's of.

901
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,890
We don't have all the best bands,
but we got most of them.

902
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:25,970
Let's be realistic.

903
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,030
Uh,
yeah.

904
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:28,860
Joe,
you make a really good point.

905
00:40:28,861 --> 00:40:29,510
We do have most of them.

906
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:34,440
America.
I'm ted nugent concert.

907
00:40:34,441 --> 00:40:37,850
The other night on tv who was there had 
it on hd net.

908
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:41,290
I have this crazy thing with ted nugent,
man to new [inaudible],

909
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:43,480
one of my favorite people to watch.
You know,

910
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:44,720
how come?
Well,

911
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:45,850
because he's.
Well,

912
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:51,350
first of all,
he's super right wing rah rah guns kill 

913
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:55,901
american bison.
He dodged the draft in Vietnam and if 

914
00:40:56,341 --> 00:40:58,350
you listen to some of the stories that 
he told,

915
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:03,440
I don't know if it's true,
but by shitting himself and by doing 

916
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,800
crystal meth and getting his heart rate 
up and then showing up,

917
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:07,680
I don't know which of those stories are 
true and you know,

918
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:13,340
but this guy dodged the draft and yet 
he's this crazy like super pro military.

919
00:41:13,351 --> 00:41:14,620
God bless our war.
Yes,

920
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:19,790
god bless you warriors.
And he's got a camo vest on and he's 

921
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:23,091
playing guitar and looking to god made 
some bad ass tunes mean no matter what 

922
00:41:23,091 --> 00:41:25,620
you say about his politics,
stranglehold is a fucking jam.

923
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:26,880
You know that,
that song,

924
00:41:26,881 --> 00:41:28,080
man,
that's a bad ass.

925
00:41:28,081 --> 00:41:29,640
That's one of my favorite all time 
songs.

926
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,900
He played the fucking shit out of a 
guitar,

927
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:32,550
right?
Yeah,

928
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:35,540
fine with ted nugent can play the 
fucking shit out of a guitar.

929
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:40,810
But god damn,
he's so crazy with this pro warrior 

930
00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:41,580
stuff and salute the warriors.
It's,

931
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:42,200
it's,
it's

932
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:44,520
first of all,
it's a pretty easy,

933
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:47,640
you know what I mean?
It's like pretty low hanging fruit to be

934
00:41:47,641 --> 00:41:49,200
like,
I'm support the troops.

935
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:54,360
It's so silly and it's,
it's almost like he's positioning 

936
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,800
himself to be a cheerleader.
You know,

937
00:41:55,810 --> 00:41:57,920
I'm your guy and you're going to 
cheerlead a guarantee.

938
00:41:57,921 --> 00:41:59,800
You're not going to get another.
But pro-america enemy.

939
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:00,920
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

940
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,340
Even controversial doled ted's 
controversial,

941
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:05,470
but you know exactly what it's 
marketing.

942
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:07,920
Yeah,
it's fucking fascinating is what it is.

943
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:09,040
Uh,
somebody,

944
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:10,210
um,
when,

945
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:14,020
when,
when they swift voted for john kerry,

946
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:19,530
bill clinton had the best point,
which is the minute they swift boated 

947
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:20,420
them when they said he didn't,
he wasn't a hero,

948
00:42:20,421 --> 00:42:25,421
isn't all that stuff.
he should have challenged dick cheney 

949
00:42:25,421 --> 00:42:27,610
and George Bush to a debate about 
Vietnam and he would've won the election

950
00:42:27,611 --> 00:42:28,960
like that.
Um,

951
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:32,700
I think the way he laid down after that 
was all over.

952
00:42:32,701 --> 00:42:37,701
It was almost like he's not really 
wanting to be president in the first 

953
00:42:37,701 --> 00:42:37,701
place.

954
00:42:37,701 --> 00:42:38,300
Uh,
he,

955
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:39,260
he's,
he's a,

956
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,310
he's a,
he's,

957
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:42,570
he's soft.
Yeah.

958
00:42:42,610 --> 00:42:43,610
Again,
that's one of those things.

959
00:42:43,611 --> 00:42:45,380
It's like,
I feel like democrats,

960
00:42:45,381 --> 00:42:47,840
if they have a shitty candidate will 
kind of admit it.

961
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:48,720
I'd be like,
eh,

962
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:50,870
no.
I feel like republicans kind of did with

963
00:42:50,871 --> 00:42:53,000
mccain where they were like,
yeah,

964
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:58,260
when,
so far as to get sarah pailin to join 

965
00:42:58,260 --> 00:42:58,260
them.
That's how little they believed in him.

966
00:42:58,260 --> 00:42:58,630
Yeah,
exactly.

967
00:42:58,631 --> 00:43:01,330
Wanted to do a little bit the trick.
They wanted to go to the party favor.

968
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,130
Yeah.
Yeah.

969
00:43:03,370 --> 00:43:05,290
Then now this,
this michelle barre.

970
00:43:05,310 --> 00:43:07,770
When things fucking.
What are you,

971
00:43:07,771 --> 00:43:11,430
I understand you want to be in charge.
I know you want to win.

972
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:13,070
That's where this winning thing comes 
again.

973
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:18,380
You want to win,
but at what cost do you really think 

974
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:20,040
she's good at being charged or 
something?

975
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:24,790
Here's the real question.
Why did this country become like this?

976
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,620
Why are other countries more relaxed 
wise like Italy the way it is,

977
00:43:29,621 --> 00:43:29,980
why

978
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:32,500
Italy is really disorganized?
There are,

979
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:34,300
I mean in terms of what are you talking 
about?

980
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:36,630
I mean about the people,
about people,

981
00:43:36,631 --> 00:43:41,631
their behavior,
what they accept and what they don't 

982
00:43:41,631 --> 00:43:43,971
accept,
why they're driven and whether or not 

983
00:43:43,971 --> 00:43:43,971
driven

984
00:43:43,971 --> 00:43:43,971
well that that's an I,
I,

985
00:43:43,971 --> 00:43:44,450
people come here.
I mean,

986
00:43:44,451 --> 00:43:48,340
I think that originally people came to 
America to escape.

987
00:43:48,970 --> 00:43:53,970
I always call us like not england,
whatever angle is like they don't have 

988
00:43:53,970 --> 00:43:57,871
guns.
Well we fucking have nothing but guns 

989
00:43:57,871 --> 00:43:57,871
like,
like,

990
00:43:57,871 --> 00:43:58,510
uh,
they,

991
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:01,470
they,
the,

992
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:06,760
the character of America is a,
it is this kind of outlaw thing.

993
00:44:08,681 --> 00:44:12,400
It's certainly become this outlaw thing 
and it has become.

994
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:15,160
We make best fucking cars and we got the
data.

995
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:18,050
It's just constant.
Nobody believes we make the best car.

996
00:44:18,310 --> 00:44:19,820
Whatever you were saying where you're 
like,

997
00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:22,300
we need to make muscle cars.
Vented muslim,

998
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:26,470
but queers.
Yeah.

999
00:44:26,471 --> 00:44:30,310
If you asked a bunch of people in the 
south and the north west,

1000
00:44:30,311 --> 00:44:31,380
if they will go,
yeah,

1001
00:44:31,381 --> 00:44:33,990
fucking America does.
It's all that stuff of we're the best.

1002
00:44:33,991 --> 00:44:35,970
You don't really hear it in other 
countries.

1003
00:44:35,971 --> 00:44:37,440
You hear like,
this is a nice

1004
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:38,920
country,
but you don't go.

1005
00:44:38,921 --> 00:44:42,910
We're the best in the world.
Are so polite about it.

1006
00:44:42,911 --> 00:44:44,680
They're like,
canadians are doing good down.

1007
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:46,520
There are apps.
Yeah.

1008
00:44:46,521 --> 00:44:51,521
They caught a lot of canadian comedians 
in the american character.

1009
00:44:51,851 --> 00:44:52,690
I don't think it has

1010
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:55,510
to do with the old west.
It's like the last,

1011
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:01,160
uh,
it's kind of the last land that was 

1012
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:01,160
settled in the world was the west.

1013
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,700
So it's just wild douche bags,

1014
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:08,410
dia that we are,
it's a great question.

1015
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:13,440
It's one of those guns,
germs and steel steel things where you 

1016
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:16,481
just go,
I don't really know why we are where we 

1017
00:45:16,481 --> 00:45:19,121
are.
I always think australian dudes are a 

1018
00:45:19,121 --> 00:45:20,420
little rough because of the prison 
thing.

1019
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,340
That's why there's so many,
uh,

1020
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:25,400
australian like leading men because 
they're like,

1021
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:28,520
fucking still dudes over there.
Um,

1022
00:45:28,910 --> 00:45:29,950
whereas,
uh,

1023
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:31,320
he had the american character.
I,

1024
00:45:31,321 --> 00:45:32,510
I don't,
I don't know.

1025
00:45:32,570 --> 00:45:34,430
But,
but I know that were a little soft.

1026
00:45:34,431 --> 00:45:35,570
Right?
I know I put,

1027
00:45:35,571 --> 00:45:36,890
I don't think we're soft,
I think,

1028
00:45:36,891 --> 00:45:39,350
well in terms of that,
but I'm saying the american character in

1029
00:45:39,351 --> 00:45:42,110
terms of like we're the best,
uh,

1030
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:43,500
we're,
we're,

1031
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:47,630
we never fucking lose nothing.
We withdraw.

1032
00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:52,710
We don't have a hero right now.
Do we have an action hero semester 

1033
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:54,170
stallone to 70 fucking years old?
He's still beating people up.

1034
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:54,980
Oh yeah.
No,

1035
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:00,000
like the rocks.
Not really much of an action hero 

1036
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:00,000
because he is.
He's legit,

1037
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:00,130
but he's not.
He's not legit.

1038
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,840
Like stallone was.
No,

1039
00:46:01,841 --> 00:46:03,160
not yet.
No,

1040
00:46:03,161 --> 00:46:04,300
but it's not going to happen.
Well,

1041
00:46:04,301 --> 00:46:08,890
the thing about stallone,
stallone was legit as an actor first.

1042
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:11,260
Like with rocky,
he was legitimate and an actor.

1043
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:16,870
He was respected.
Then he went on commercial as commercial

1044
00:46:16,871 --> 00:46:21,871
as you can get like many,
many times that he started out as that 

1045
00:46:21,871 --> 00:46:24,490
legit guy.
But in terms of action stars,

1046
00:46:24,491 --> 00:46:29,491
I mean I feel like you had said like the
new guy's going to be like a hardy 

1047
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:35,370
christian bale.
Christian bale I guess is kind of 

1048
00:46:35,370 --> 00:46:37,930
different action star,
but it's the same way.

1049
00:46:37,931 --> 00:46:38,290
Yeah.
No.

1050
00:46:38,291 --> 00:46:40,230
If there's none of that 80,

1051
00:46:43,130 --> 00:46:45,110
it's morning in America.
That shit,

1052
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:49,550
like all that that's over.
And now it's just this like it's America

1053
00:46:49,551 --> 00:46:51,620
to me is defined at this point by 
dislike.

1054
00:46:51,890 --> 00:46:56,890
Vicious infighTing between left and 
right and everyone's got their own 

1055
00:46:56,890 --> 00:47:01,401
little own little bunker and fuck them 
and everyone's got in the audience.

1056
00:47:01,521 --> 00:47:04,850
Everyone's got their own little feedback
loop of like people.

1057
00:47:05,150 --> 00:47:07,640
I go on the huffington post and the 
daily beast.

1058
00:47:07,641 --> 00:47:10,910
I would never go on fox news.
I would never.

1059
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:12,500
I actually tweeted a couple of weeks 
ago,

1060
00:47:12,890 --> 00:47:17,890
uh,
which news do you guys root for fox or 

1061
00:47:17,890 --> 00:47:17,890
cnn?
Because that's what it's come to.

1062
00:47:17,890 --> 00:47:22,790
It's come down to these teams of like,
I like that news.

1063
00:47:22,970 --> 00:47:24,260
Yeah,
it is a while.

1064
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:28,040
Meanwhile it's,
it ought to be facts.

1065
00:47:28,490 --> 00:47:30,790
You know what I mean?
Now it's come down to this like,

1066
00:47:31,330 --> 00:47:35,220
tell me the facts that favor my ego 
telling me that,

1067
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:36,640
spin this,
so that.

1068
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:38,890
So that my worldview is confirmed.

1069
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:43,920
It is amazing and we've allowed 
entertainment to enter into the news 

1070
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:47,140
because that is exactly what it is.
Editorial and entertainment.

1071
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:47,790
Yeah.
No,

1072
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:50,140
when you,
whenever you see some fucking guy and he

1073
00:47:50,141 --> 00:47:53,140
gets busted doing something creepy 
sexually and he's like a senator.

1074
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:57,200
Fox news will always put democrat and 
second,

1075
00:47:57,980 --> 00:47:59,540
doesn't matter if that guy's a 
republican,

1076
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:02,600
they'll put democrat and then they 
correct it,

1077
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:07,900
but the thing is,
the most important thing is that the 

1078
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:11,981
first inclination,
the first image was another pervert 

1079
00:48:11,981 --> 00:48:11,981
democrat.

1080
00:48:11,981 --> 00:48:13,590
Right.
That's illegal,

1081
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:15,270
man.
You guys are criminals.

1082
00:48:15,271 --> 00:48:18,720
But if the fucking sending the news,
you're a propaganda machine.

1083
00:48:18,721 --> 00:48:21,660
They are very probably supposed to be 
protected from that.

1084
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:22,620
Well,
but they,

1085
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:23,430
they,
they,

1086
00:48:23,431 --> 00:48:24,660
that's all.
That's all gone.

1087
00:48:24,690 --> 00:48:26,970
This is the protection from that dude,
the internet.

1088
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:28,620
I agree.
Dude.

1089
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:31,110
Since doing this,
doing your pockets.

1090
00:48:31,111 --> 00:48:31,690
The first one,
I don't know,

1091
00:48:31,691 --> 00:48:36,530
it was six weeks ago or something.
I really see the value of the.

1092
00:48:36,930 --> 00:48:39,960
It's just so democratic.
It's fucking fair.

1093
00:48:39,961 --> 00:48:44,910
Because I went on the road and I had 
people showing up from twitter and I was

1094
00:48:44,911 --> 00:48:49,911
getting like the.
I was getting a bunch of money at the 

1095
00:48:49,911 --> 00:48:53,001
door,
like I was getting a percentage of the 

1096
00:48:53,001 --> 00:48:53,001
door instead of this thing of like,
yeah,

1097
00:48:53,001 --> 00:48:56,250
we'll give you 1500 for the weekend and 
then you maybe if you make the bonus,

1098
00:48:56,251 --> 00:48:59,340
which you never going to make,
and then I can do one show,

1099
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:02,190
tweet it out and get a grant,
you know what I mean?

1100
00:49:02,191 --> 00:49:07,191
Get like a fair wage for,
for the skill and the,

1101
00:49:07,550 --> 00:49:11,160
a popularity instead of them going like,
you know,

1102
00:49:11,161 --> 00:49:12,480
you're not popular,
you're going,

1103
00:49:12,481 --> 00:49:17,481
but I have 80,000
people on twitter who sam popular come 

1104
00:49:17,851 --> 00:49:21,290
to the show and yet you're telling me.
So.

1105
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:23,220
So that's what's great about the 
internet is,

1106
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,620
is it,
is really fair.

1107
00:49:25,650 --> 00:49:26,790
And,
and uh,

1108
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:31,230
and I didn't even realize the sort of 
power of it.

1109
00:49:31,231 --> 00:49:36,231
you were quick to.
It wasn't because of your worldview or 

1110
00:49:36,231 --> 00:49:37,200
was it because,
uh,

1111
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:40,920
because you just happened to,
you lucked into it.

1112
00:49:40,950 --> 00:49:45,950
Well,
I've been pretty deeply embedded into 

1113
00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:49,131
the internet since 1998.
I had a message board on my website and 

1114
00:49:49,131 --> 00:49:52,290
so from 1998 I would write blogs and 
interact with people on my message board

1115
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:57,320
and I think in 2001 we switched it over 
to a vbulletin and now it's kinda like 

1116
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:59,250
$5 million posts on it.
yeah,

1117
00:49:59,270 --> 00:50:04,270
it's got.
I mean I don't know how many thousands 

1118
00:50:04,270 --> 00:50:06,741
of members,
but it's super active and people are 

1119
00:50:06,741 --> 00:50:07,080
constantly posting on a regular basis 
and there's a.

1120
00:50:07,081 --> 00:50:11,340
There's great value in connecting with 
people online.

1121
00:50:11,370 --> 00:50:16,370
The biggest resource in human history 
for gathering information,

1122
00:50:16,561 --> 00:50:18,990
for being introduced to new information 
is this.

1123
00:50:19,230 --> 00:50:21,510
Nothing is like twitter has ever existed
before.

1124
00:50:21,511 --> 00:50:23,940
Every fucking day someone's sending 
someone.

1125
00:50:23,941 --> 00:50:27,470
I don't know who's sending me some cool 
link yesterday.

1126
00:50:27,471 --> 00:50:28,340
It was some fucking

1127
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:33,320
crazy video where these dudes took a 
hornet and they threw it into a spider's

1128
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:35,270
nest to see who would win the horn of 
the spider.

1129
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:38,360
It was fucking bad ass man.
That marvel,

1130
00:50:38,361 --> 00:50:41,600
but the right.
That spider just fucks that hornet up.

1131
00:50:41,601 --> 00:50:43,670
Spoiler alert,
spoiler alert.

1132
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:47,810
It's worth seeing again though,
even if I have spider,

1133
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:49,910
spider,
jack's the hornet and so no,

1134
00:50:49,970 --> 00:50:52,570
no comparison long was the fight.
That was very quick.

1135
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:54,240
Hugh sackett,
did you give it a van?

1136
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:56,780
A mma announcing?
No,

1137
00:50:56,781 --> 00:50:57,800
I didn't.
No commentary.

1138
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:01,130
I did a.
I did a lot of this fuck by myself.

1139
00:51:01,190 --> 00:51:03,150
You know when you by yourself going,
fuck,

1140
00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:08,890
we just lucky spiders are little man.
could you imagine if a spider the size 

1141
00:51:08,890 --> 00:51:08,890
of your house?
Man,

1142
00:51:08,890 --> 00:51:13,841
you have translators out here.
I didn't even know there was translated 

1143
00:51:13,841 --> 00:51:14,580
in California.
Huge dead translate on.

1144
00:51:14,610 --> 00:51:17,540
It's killed once,
one accidentally.

1145
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:20,150
I didn't realize I'd killed until I 
stepped on it.

1146
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:24,080
It was in front of my house.
It was like my fucking hand was my hand.

1147
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:25,450
I'm not joking.
It was my guy,

1148
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:29,210
harry harry fucking crab.
It was a crab walking around.

1149
00:51:29,390 --> 00:51:33,140
I really didn't realize how big it was.
I stepped on it and it crunched and then

1150
00:51:33,150 --> 00:51:38,150
I went back inside the house and got a 
flashlight and came outside and looked 

1151
00:51:38,150 --> 00:51:41,090
at.
Giant was so big.

1152
00:51:41,091 --> 00:51:42,890
It almost seemed like a pet that got 
loose.

1153
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:47,920
Doesn't that freak you out that when you
lay in your bed that some spiders that 

1154
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:48,290
could crawl from the host of fear 
factor.

1155
00:51:48,530 --> 00:51:51,440
Okay.
Everything can be probably somewhere.

1156
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:53,540
I've seen everything creepy crawly on 
this planet.

1157
00:51:53,541 --> 00:51:55,100
On your few.
Can't throw me.

1158
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:56,150
Yeah,
the dude,

1159
00:51:56,420 --> 00:52:01,420
eddie bravo went to Costa Rica once and 
he told me how horrifying it was laying 

1160
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:04,050
in this place because it was like an 
open air cabana and that's how they kind

1161
00:52:04,051 --> 00:52:09,051
of kept at cooley were above the ocean 
and above the wall there was like a gap 

1162
00:52:09,051 --> 00:52:10,010
between the ceiling and the wall.

1163
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:15,140
Whereas just air comes in and fucking 
bugs and he said did well like birds.

1164
00:52:15,410 --> 00:52:20,000
These birds size bugs flying around the 
fucking room.

1165
00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:21,230
Yeah.
That,

1166
00:52:21,250 --> 00:52:23,840
that kind of shit freaks me out,
but this isn't that bad.

1167
00:52:23,841 --> 00:52:25,220
Every now and then you got to kill a 
snake.

1168
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:27,470
Based on that.
You were talking about a snake the other

1169
00:52:27,471 --> 00:52:32,471
day.
He killed a rattlesnake the other day 

1170
00:52:32,471 --> 00:52:34,620
and then there was transistor.
You're time I fuck rattle snakes and 

1171
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:39,010
people say you shouldn't do that.
And because I've got kids and 

1172
00:52:39,010 --> 00:52:39,850
rattlesnakes can go fuck themselves.
Yeah.

1173
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:41,690
If I can,
and I have dogs,

1174
00:52:41,930 --> 00:52:46,930
my I've had when I had pit bulls,
both my dogs had to bring them to the 

1175
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:48,500
hospital on two separate occasions for 
rattlesnake bites.

1176
00:52:48,530 --> 00:52:49,720
Oh my god.
Yeah,

1177
00:52:50,330 --> 00:52:50,860
yeah.
No,

1178
00:52:51,430 --> 00:52:52,040
no joke.
Dude.

1179
00:52:52,041 --> 00:52:54,770
You're a fucking vigilante.
I went running ones with the dogs.

1180
00:52:54,870 --> 00:52:58,730
I ran over this rattlesnake and I didn't
realize I had run over it until I was in

1181
00:52:58,731 --> 00:53:00,980
the air,
in between paces.

1182
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:05,980
I thought it was a log.
I thought it was a big ass fucking 

1183
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:05,980
branch.
I mean it was big,

1184
00:53:06,010 --> 00:53:11,010
you know,
because I'm running with the pitbulls 

1185
00:53:11,010 --> 00:53:11,010
and I have to keep up with them and I'm 
taking the turn and as I take the term,

1186
00:53:11,010 --> 00:53:11,810
we'd go over.
They didn't notice it either.

1187
00:53:11,811 --> 00:53:14,480
Thank god,
because it was totally outstretched.

1188
00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:17,450
They go over it.
I go over and then I stop and turn.

1189
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:22,660
I pulled him over,
I get 'em on the leashes and I start 

1190
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:23,110
pulling up to the thing and it's like my
forearm dude.

1191
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:26,370
It's enormous.
Big fucking

1192
00:53:26,390 --> 00:53:27,960
rad norm.
It's like your forearm.

1193
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:33,080
My form for a snake is huge for a guy.
It's not too small.

1194
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:35,760
It's not that bad,
it's not embarrassing,

1195
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:41,120
but these fucking snake was huge dude.
It was like it had to be eight feet 

1196
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:41,120
long.

1197
00:53:42,770 --> 00:53:43,840
You didn't kill it and you just.

1198
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:45,600
I try to kill it,
but yeah,

1199
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:49,920
I try to tie the dogs up your website 
very quickly.

1200
00:53:49,921 --> 00:53:51,660
My website I've been doing since 
[inaudible] 98.

1201
00:53:51,690 --> 00:53:53,340
And what,
who do you think

1202
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:56,770
is who is like if you had one,
if you.

1203
00:53:56,771 --> 00:54:01,771
If there was like the joe rogan fan,
can you describe him or her?

1204
00:54:02,651 --> 00:54:03,920
To me?
No,

1205
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:07,660
there's what do they all have?
What's the commonalIty?

1206
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:08,260
Is there anything?

1207
00:54:08,350 --> 00:54:09,610
No,
I don't think so.

1208
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:14,640
No.
There's a lot of right wing guys on my 

1209
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:16,180
message board and a lot of like really 
hippie guys and you know,

1210
00:54:16,181 --> 00:54:18,380
I can say there's,
there's no,

1211
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:23,500
you know,
there's people that appreciate someone 

1212
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:25,021
who's going to tell you the truth is 
going to be people that know that I've 

1213
00:54:25,021 --> 00:54:27,850
been involved in controversial shit from
the beginning of my career.

1214
00:54:27,851 --> 00:54:30,820
I don't.
I think that if you can express yourself

1215
00:54:30,970 --> 00:54:35,970
as long as you can,
let people know how you feel about 

1216
00:54:35,970 --> 00:54:35,970
things you should,
you should do.

1217
00:54:35,970 --> 00:54:39,991
What the fuck are you like?
You should do what you want and not 

1218
00:54:39,991 --> 00:54:39,991
worry about others.

1219
00:54:39,991 --> 00:54:41,990
That's what I love about twitter is you 
just say something like,

1220
00:54:41,991 --> 00:54:42,890
fuck you,
and you just go,

1221
00:54:43,130 --> 00:54:43,660
yeah,
no,

1222
00:54:43,670 --> 00:54:45,250
I'm not taking it down.
This is what I.

1223
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:50,380
like I said,
it's the George Bush thing and just go 

1224
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:52,601
like he,
George Bush never made a mistake 

1225
00:54:52,601 --> 00:54:52,601
because.
yeah,

1226
00:54:52,601 --> 00:54:53,060
well that's what I mean.
Like some people go when,

1227
00:54:53,061 --> 00:54:54,830
when,
when we killed in london,

1228
00:54:54,831 --> 00:54:59,831
it's like,
or gets killed or whatever you want to 

1229
00:54:59,831 --> 00:54:59,990
say it in people's heads.
I think they get that credit.

1230
00:54:59,991 --> 00:55:00,650
Bush somehow.

1231
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:04,800
If there's one constant in all the 
people that I do meet,

1232
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:09,801
is that there?
Surprisingly nice and I get this from 

1233
00:55:09,801 --> 00:55:12,981
comedy club waitresses.
They're always saying that when we do 

1234
00:55:12,981 --> 00:55:12,981
theaters,
people always say that like,

1235
00:55:12,981 --> 00:55:14,280
your fans are so nice.
They're you guys.

1236
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:17,160
That's what,
if there's anything I try to put out,

1237
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:22,250
are they put up like underdogs?
I guess everyone's maybe in this world 

1238
00:55:22,250 --> 00:55:25,500
if you're not a fucking ceo,
you're an underdog.

1239
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:26,430
Yeah,
I mean,

1240
00:55:26,431 --> 00:55:31,431
yeah.
If what you said about corporations is 

1241
00:55:31,431 --> 00:55:31,431
true and it is the,
yeah,

1242
00:55:31,431 --> 00:55:35,001
we're all underdogs and we're all in 
this together and I think if there's 

1243
00:55:35,001 --> 00:55:39,651
anything they share is that there's a 
lot of fucking nice people that come to 

1244
00:55:39,651 --> 00:55:42,201
my shows and people that are just trying
to have some fun man and people that 

1245
00:55:42,201 --> 00:55:44,520
respect someone who's going to say what 
they really think.

1246
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:46,750
Yeah.
That's the other thing politically,

1247
00:55:46,751 --> 00:55:49,450
that they've been learning.
Studies have elections.

1248
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:53,920
They people vote for people with the 
courage of their convictions.

1249
00:55:54,290 --> 00:55:55,660
That's why they go.
He's a flip flopper.

1250
00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:57,190
Everyone's like,
fuck this guy.

1251
00:55:57,580 --> 00:56:02,580
Wait.
He takes into consideration facts and 

1252
00:56:02,580 --> 00:56:06,270
changes his opinion.
That fucking fuck this guy because he 

1253
00:56:06,270 --> 00:56:09,190
just needs you to be like this pillar.
That's George Bush was a pillar of,

1254
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:12,730
I believe stupidity,
but he wasn't.

1255
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:13,930
He didn't move.

1256
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:19,460
Yeah.
They also have everybody convinced that 

1257
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:19,460
if you do flip flop and get caught,
you're done.

1258
00:56:19,630 --> 00:56:21,950
Instead of someone coming up and saying,
yeah,

1259
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:22,210
in

1260
00:56:22,210 --> 00:56:24,100
some ways you done because

1261
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:25,780
they go,
this guy's soft.

1262
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:31,080
This guy's a flip flopper.
People respond to the courage of your 

1263
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:32,290
convictions.
I told a story the other night,

1264
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:33,880
uh,
at our,

1265
00:56:33,881 --> 00:56:37,480
I did a show with ari.
I'm in montreal.

1266
00:56:37,510 --> 00:56:39,780
It was,
we were telling stories and I told a sex

1267
00:56:39,781 --> 00:56:41,050
story that,
that,

1268
00:56:41,051 --> 00:56:44,320
uh,
I was dating two girls at the same time,

1269
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:50,400
which I didn't like.
I don't like doing that because I told 

1270
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:50,400
them was variety.
Well,

1271
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:50,400
no,
no,

1272
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:50,710
no,
no,

1273
00:56:50,711 --> 00:56:52,930
not my problem is when you date more 
than one girl,

1274
00:56:52,931 --> 00:56:57,931
you get the stories mixed up.
Oh yeah.

1275
00:56:58,480 --> 00:56:58,770
He

1276
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:00,910
died in nine slash 11.
My mistake.

1277
00:57:01,290 --> 00:57:02,860
Um,
so,

1278
00:57:02,861 --> 00:57:04,230
uh,
so,

1279
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:05,910
uh,
so I was dating two girls.

1280
00:57:05,970 --> 00:57:10,970
One came over thursday night.
She had very short hair then and she 

1281
00:57:11,190 --> 00:57:14,040
gave me oral sex.
friday night,

1282
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:16,240
a long haired girl come over.
She,

1283
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:20,040
she don't come over and we had regular 
sex.

1284
00:57:20,550 --> 00:57:23,850
A saturday night,
the short haired girl comes back,

1285
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:27,210
we have oral sex again.
I go to the bathroom,

1286
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:29,820
she comes out and goes,
hey neil,

1287
00:57:29,821 --> 00:57:31,110
if you're going to sleep with other 
girls,

1288
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:34,200
uh,
be a little more clever about it.

1289
00:57:34,201 --> 00:57:35,040
And I was like,
what are you talking about?

1290
00:57:35,041 --> 00:57:40,041
She goes,
I just found a hairband and economy 

1291
00:57:40,041 --> 00:57:41,520
behind your bed.
Now I'm basically cold,

1292
00:57:41,521 --> 00:57:43,850
busted and uh,
and I took a pause,

1293
00:57:43,851 --> 00:57:44,760
like a really.
And she goes,

1294
00:57:44,761 --> 00:57:45,240
yeah,
and I go,

1295
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:48,000
man,
what has been going on in here?

1296
00:57:48,390 --> 00:57:51,810
And just walked out of the room and she 
was fine with it.

1297
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:56,850
What's because I just sold you just go.
That's crazy.

1298
00:57:57,390 --> 00:57:57,960
And just

1299
00:57:59,690 --> 00:58:02,370
eddie murray used to do a joke about it 
where it's like just denied.

1300
00:58:02,371 --> 00:58:03,090
Denied.
Denied.

1301
00:58:03,091 --> 00:58:03,600
Denied.
Denied.

1302
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:08,620
Yeah.
But that's better than denying instead 

1303
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:09,060
of denying you're incredulous.
You can't believe this is going down.

1304
00:58:09,570 --> 00:58:12,810
That's better than denying who you 
reacted perfectly.

1305
00:58:12,811 --> 00:58:14,700
If you denied it,
you'd have probably been busted.

1306
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:16,050
Yeah.
But instead of denying it,

1307
00:58:16,051 --> 00:58:21,051
you like,
you didn't even consider it as a 

1308
00:58:21,051 --> 00:58:21,051
possibility that you could have been.
He's been doing.

1309
00:58:21,051 --> 00:58:21,051
Yeah.
You were like,

1310
00:58:21,051 --> 00:58:23,540
what the fuck is this?
I got to talk to them

1311
00:58:23,550 --> 00:58:25,080
manager or something?
Yeah.

1312
00:58:25,081 --> 00:58:27,330
You must have a clean underneath bed 
though.

1313
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:32,340
I never clean underneath my bed.
So even if a girl came underneath my 

1314
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:32,340
bed,
she'd be like,

1315
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:32,360
oh my god,
there's $500 bucks.

1316
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:35,640
Somebody taught me a long time ago.
If you're dating more than one girl,

1317
00:58:35,641 --> 00:58:37,980
you gotta,
you gotta have a lint brush.

1318
00:58:38,010 --> 00:58:39,490
That's the key.
when pro,

1319
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:43,470
because they girls shared a lot of hair 
and earrings.

1320
00:58:43,530 --> 00:58:46,410
You gotta scoop earrings out.
You got to have a lint brush.

1321
00:58:46,411 --> 00:58:49,950
You really gotta be on top of it.
You're getting variety.

1322
00:58:49,951 --> 00:58:51,030
Jail.
Yeah,

1323
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:52,860
but you're also.
There's a lotta,

1324
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:54,450
there's a lot of.
There's.

1325
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:59,480
Look,
people don't think about it from the 

1326
00:58:59,480 --> 00:58:59,480
guy's point of view.
Who's,

1327
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:01,580
who has to date three different women.
They don't.

1328
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:03,480
They only see it if you're a dog.
Yes.

1329
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:06,960
but do you have any idea of the stress?
I'm under that.

1330
00:59:06,961 --> 00:59:11,961
I'm constantly having a lint brush 
things and fucking collect the earrings 

1331
00:59:11,961 --> 00:59:12,090
and,
and um,

1332
00:59:12,150 --> 00:59:13,590
socks.
People.

1333
00:59:13,591 --> 00:59:13,740
Don't.

1334
00:59:14,130 --> 00:59:15,390
People feel bad for you,
dude.

1335
00:59:15,890 --> 00:59:18,830
You should be able to cheat and not get 
fucked with you.

1336
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:21,120
Fucking these broads.
Got to get off my back.

1337
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:22,040
What

1338
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:24,070
do you think about people that want to 
live a,

1339
00:59:24,071 --> 00:59:26,810
a polyamorous life and just continue 
that forever?

1340
00:59:26,811 --> 00:59:31,811
Like the idea that we should never be 
committed to one person and we all 

1341
00:59:31,811 --> 00:59:34,340
should stop being so jealous about what,
what our loved ones do with their bodies

1342
00:59:34,341 --> 00:59:36,980
and just go and have a wild.

1343
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:39,880
It seems crazy.
It's a great idea.

1344
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:44,770
In theory,
I think it's good cause I like I have a.

1345
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:48,940
I had a girlfriend and then we broke up 
and now it seems as if we're going to.

1346
00:59:48,970 --> 00:59:51,310
We're headed back to togetherness.
Oh shit.

1347
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:52,480
I'm.
Hi.

1348
00:59:52,870 --> 00:59:57,870
I'm and I'm and,
and we were talking about it yesterday 

1349
00:59:57,870 --> 00:59:59,950
actually.
That is my problem with relationships is

1350
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:05,620
you have to make an emotional promise in
the future.

1351
01:00:06,070 --> 01:00:10,420
So I have to go.
I'm going to love you 10 years from now.

1352
01:00:10,570 --> 01:00:15,010
Meanwhile,
I've changed so much in three years.

1353
01:00:15,130 --> 01:00:17,830
the fact that I'm making fucking 
emotional promises.

1354
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:20,110
It's crazy.
I hope I love you.

1355
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:22,360
I hope I love you,
but the idea of going like,

1356
01:00:22,630 --> 01:00:27,630
I guarantee you I love you and if I 
can't then you get half of my shit.

1357
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:32,220
I bet you that I'm going to love you.
I'll bet you half my shit that I'm going

1358
01:00:32,221 --> 01:00:32,290
to

1359
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:35,900
relationships make sense to me.
Of course marrIage doesn't make sense to

1360
01:00:35,901 --> 01:00:40,901
me.
Less kids are involved and even then I 

1361
01:00:40,901 --> 01:00:43,631
only got married because of my wife.
I wanted her to be happy and I wasn't 

1362
01:00:43,631 --> 01:00:47,621
going anywhere.
I'm committed to the whole thing and 

1363
01:00:47,621 --> 01:00:49,460
raising children all requires this level
of commitment and that and I'm more than

1364
01:00:49,461 --> 01:00:54,461
willing to embrace it.
The only reason why I was willing to do 

1365
01:00:54,461 --> 01:00:54,461
it legally and sign all that stuff,
I was like,

1366
01:00:54,461 --> 01:00:57,800
this is like,
this is some crazy stupid tradition.

1367
01:00:57,980 --> 01:01:02,980
It's completely ridiculous.
Then sayIng you should have to break up 

1368
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:03,680
and you have to bring in the legal 
system.

1369
01:01:03,681 --> 01:01:07,370
So to do it without children to me seems
preposterous.

1370
01:01:07,371 --> 01:01:12,371
To do it with children is ridiculous,
but I submitted to it but to do it just 

1371
01:01:12,371 --> 01:01:14,930
because you're in love like my god,
you're crazy.

1372
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:17,480
You're connecting yourself with someone 
legally and

1373
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:19,580
well.
Do you really fucking know them?

1374
01:01:19,820 --> 01:01:21,610
You don't.
I mean it's fucking.

1375
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:23,500
You don't specify things are going 
great.

1376
01:01:23,530 --> 01:01:28,530
Yeah.
When your life is going great and 

1377
01:01:28,530 --> 01:01:28,530
everything's going great,
you you barely know people.

1378
01:01:28,530 --> 01:01:29,770
You know them.
When some shit hits the fan,

1379
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:34,800
it's easy to.
It's easy to know somebody when you're 

1380
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:34,800
in fucking.
You're both in love with each.

1381
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:38,920
Exactly what's the.
Especially in the beginning because 

1382
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:38,920
every little annoyances like,

1383
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:38,920
no,
that's a little thing,

1384
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:43,170
and then it metastasizes and it's three 
and a half years later and you're like,

1385
01:01:43,260 --> 01:01:43,560
ooh,

1386
01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:48,040
and also you might be evolving and them 
not advice averse.

1387
01:01:48,050 --> 01:01:48,410
You know

1388
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:54,840
how you've evolved as a person.
You almost are saying when you're in,

1389
01:01:55,371 --> 01:02:00,371
if you're going into this relationship 
like I'm done revolving when I know the 

1390
01:02:00,371 --> 01:02:04,080
way I feel about this and you is never 
going to change.

1391
01:02:04,110 --> 01:02:06,480
It's like it just.
It seems like a state basis

1392
01:02:06,730 --> 01:02:08,710
when you could.
You could get involved with the chicken.

1393
01:02:08,711 --> 01:02:12,040
Then she can turn vegan on you and then 
you're in the middle of the relationship

1394
01:02:12,041 --> 01:02:14,590
and all of a sudden they're giving you 
shit about eating cheeseburgers.

1395
01:02:14,750 --> 01:02:17,220
definitely.
Oh fuck that woman.

1396
01:02:17,370 --> 01:02:19,530
Have you well know I'm people think

1397
01:02:20,180 --> 01:02:21,960
I am vegan.
I didn't do.

1398
01:02:21,961 --> 01:02:24,710
I was single when I never do it in.
Why not the that?

1399
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:27,750
Because the meat industry is fucking 
disgusting.

1400
01:02:28,950 --> 01:02:32,490
Like the amount of greenhouse gases,
cows and mitch shit like that.

1401
01:02:32,660 --> 01:02:37,660
Like they're worse than cars and I'm not
that big of mika.

1402
01:02:37,890 --> 01:02:38,940
I just wasn't,
you know.

1403
01:02:38,990 --> 01:02:40,820
Here's the problem with that statement.
Go.

1404
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:44,360
Cows are awesome and so are cars.
So we've got a problem.

1405
01:02:45,260 --> 01:02:47,070
Cool.
We've got a problem because I enjoy.

1406
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:49,520
You testified before congress.
Uh,

1407
01:02:49,521 --> 01:02:51,110
I will call me.
That'd be.

1408
01:02:51,111 --> 01:02:55,880
I will have that testimony and if I do 
testify before congress,

1409
01:02:55,881 --> 01:03:00,020
you can guarantee 100 percent.
I will be high on marijuana are usually.

1410
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:01,280
Well,
whatever testifying.

1411
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:04,490
Did the fear factor people get get on 
you about being,

1412
01:03:04,790 --> 01:03:05,860
talking about being high end.

1413
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:10,880
One of the producers sent me a text 
message when we had signed the deal 

1414
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:13,500
saying breakout the pot lollipops 
because it was a,

1415
01:03:13,710 --> 01:03:18,710
was an inside joke.
I would take the pot lollipop every day 

1416
01:03:18,710 --> 01:03:18,710
at work.
Right.

1417
01:03:18,710 --> 01:03:20,250
That's how I enjoyed the show.
I enjoyed doing it.

1418
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:21,930
When I was stoned.
I would come in,

1419
01:03:21,931 --> 01:03:26,931
if I wasn't stone,
I would think about all the shit that I 

1420
01:03:26,931 --> 01:03:29,211
could be doing at home.
I could be playing pool with one of my 

1421
01:03:29,211 --> 01:03:29,520
friends.
I could go to jujitsu class,

1422
01:03:29,521 --> 01:03:31,710
I,
I'll do all these things that I,

1423
01:03:31,711 --> 01:03:36,711
that I would like to do today and write 
some jokes instead of being out here in 

1424
01:03:36,711 --> 01:03:40,701
some fucking rock quarry with six 
different knuckleheads that want to be 

1425
01:03:40,701 --> 01:03:44,661
famous on tv,
but then out of that pot lollipop and 

1426
01:03:44,661 --> 01:03:48,901
now it's soaking the full experience and
then all of a sudden I'm like a fucking 

1427
01:03:48,901 --> 01:03:52,371
scientist.
Then all of a sudden I'm studying human 

1428
01:03:52,371 --> 01:03:55,581
behavior and taking it all in house and 
cars and thinking about new orleans 

1429
01:03:55,581 --> 01:03:59,640
between the sun and the earth and how 
this is fear keeps the heat in and it is

1430
01:03:59,650 --> 01:04:01,200
that.
If it just shifts a little bit,

1431
01:04:01,201 --> 01:04:03,170
we freeze to death.
That's the.

1432
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:05,520
Did you.
Did you tell your back on a lot of cops?

1433
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:06,240
Oh yeah.
Yeah,

1434
01:04:06,270 --> 01:04:07,110
right away.
Great.

1435
01:04:07,410 --> 01:04:08,880
There's no way to do it.
Other than that,

1436
01:04:09,060 --> 01:04:14,060
I wouldn't disrespect people that enjoy 
the original show by trying to do it 

1437
01:04:14,060 --> 01:04:14,060
sober.

1438
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:20,000
One hundred 48 episodes.
Don't out of my fucking mind the 

1439
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:20,130
integrity of that,
but listen,

1440
01:04:20,131 --> 01:04:25,131
it's medical marijuana.
What I'm doing is legal in the state of 

1441
01:04:25,131 --> 01:04:25,131
California.
I'm a.

1442
01:04:25,131 --> 01:04:25,740
I'm a voter

1443
01:04:26,980 --> 01:04:30,730
I that had told me to ask you about 
something that's like,

1444
01:04:30,790 --> 01:04:35,790
it's,
it's the chemical that gets released 

1445
01:04:35,790 --> 01:04:38,431
when you die,
but you can eat it or smoke it or 

1446
01:04:38,431 --> 01:04:38,490
something around the dmt not.
Yeah.

1447
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:39,740
Yeah.
Oh,

1448
01:04:39,790 --> 01:04:40,540
sorry.
Sorry.

1449
01:04:40,860 --> 01:04:44,310
I've talked to about it so many times or
something like google it.

1450
01:04:44,530 --> 01:04:47,220
They'll give you a documentary to watch.
Can you get me any?

1451
01:04:47,730 --> 01:04:49,140
No,
I can't because it's illegal.

1452
01:04:49,141 --> 01:04:52,500
You fucking retard.
You mean like lollipops,

1453
01:04:52,501 --> 01:04:55,340
you know?
I mean like dimethyl tree.

1454
01:04:55,620 --> 01:04:58,290
Domestic trip to me is like really,
really illegal.

1455
01:04:58,590 --> 01:05:00,750
Like it's not like a slap on the wrist 
sort of thing.

1456
01:05:01,710 --> 01:05:03,840
Having a nuclear weapon in your house or
something.

1457
01:05:03,930 --> 01:05:05,910
Is that true?
It's scheduled one,

1458
01:05:06,730 --> 01:05:11,270
but so is weed,
but weed is elise has admitted it may.

1459
01:05:11,271 --> 01:05:13,860
Even the government has admitted has 
certain medical properties to it.

1460
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:14,830
There's,
you know,

1461
01:05:14,850 --> 01:05:19,850
it's very hard,
very hard pressed to come up with 

1462
01:05:19,850 --> 01:05:19,850
medical properties for

1463
01:05:19,850 --> 01:05:23,040
dmt.
The problem is dmt exists in many 

1464
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:25,981
different plants,
not just one and all the plants that it 

1465
01:05:25,981 --> 01:05:28,371
exists in our legal right,
so you can actually have a plant that 

1466
01:05:28,371 --> 01:05:32,370
contains dmt in it and it's not like 
having a marijuana plant which contains 

1467
01:05:32,370 --> 01:05:33,370
thc.
The dmt plant would not be illegal.

1468
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:35,950
It would only be illegal if you 
extracted it,

1469
01:05:36,430 --> 01:05:37,960
went into the plant and took this stuff 
out.

1470
01:05:37,961 --> 01:05:39,840
But the problem is also exists in your,
your,

1471
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:42,130
your own body.
It's like terence mckenna joke.

1472
01:05:42,131 --> 01:05:44,240
Everybody's holding when it comes to the
you,

1473
01:05:44,290 --> 01:05:45,730
you're all,
you're all legal.

1474
01:05:45,860 --> 01:05:46,480
You know,
you're all.

1475
01:05:46,750 --> 01:05:49,050
Y'all have it.
Isn't hgh illegal?

1476
01:05:49,710 --> 01:05:51,970
You'll have different synthesize with 
bacteria.

1477
01:05:51,971 --> 01:05:54,430
I mean they make it something that they 
make in a laboratory.

1478
01:05:54,580 --> 01:05:55,060
It's different,

1479
01:05:55,090 --> 01:05:58,420
but I'm saying it's not mobile dentical 
I don't know.

1480
01:05:58,421 --> 01:05:58,840
No,
no.

1481
01:05:58,841 --> 01:06:03,841
You can get it prescribed.
It's prescribed it for a bunch of 

1482
01:06:03,841 --> 01:06:03,841
different things.
For recurring.

1483
01:06:03,841 --> 01:06:04,810
It's healthy.
It's healthy for your body,

1484
01:06:05,370 --> 01:06:05,940
you know?
I mean,

1485
01:06:06,010 --> 01:06:08,410
I'm not saying all levels of it are 
healthy,

1486
01:06:08,411 --> 01:06:13,411
but for people that have injuries per 
month because I want really want to 

1487
01:06:13,411 --> 01:06:13,411
know.
Well,

1488
01:06:13,411 --> 01:06:14,110
we'll sit down.
I'll talk to,

1489
01:06:14,111 --> 01:06:14,530
you know.
I know,

1490
01:06:14,531 --> 01:06:15,850
But I want to.
I don't want to wait.

1491
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:17,470
I want to know the information.
Okay,

1492
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:22,471
well I'll do that some other time.
Maybe you didn't fuck in the army knew 

1493
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:25,720
you should've gotten high with us before
the show.

1494
01:06:26,370 --> 01:06:31,370
Neil.
Neil brennan is not high on marijuana 

1495
01:06:31,370 --> 01:06:31,370
and brian and our need some in your 
life.

1496
01:06:31,370 --> 01:06:32,080
Brown settled.
Yeah,

1497
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:34,270
I do drink.
Not really.

1498
01:06:34,390 --> 01:06:36,650
It'll put you in a good place.
How can we take the weed?

1499
01:06:37,090 --> 01:06:39,160
Because it just makes me sleepy.
But you get in the wrong lead.

1500
01:06:39,660 --> 01:06:42,580
My does not make you sleepy.
It makes you think about space.

1501
01:06:43,390 --> 01:06:44,050
Yeah.
No,

1502
01:06:44,051 --> 01:06:45,840
I do want to do the uh,
the,

1503
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,320
the,
the chamber.

1504
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:49,150
You should do it then the fuck you want 
to do it?

1505
01:06:49,220 --> 01:06:50,170
Well,
who's holding you back?

1506
01:06:50,230 --> 01:06:51,610
If you want to do it,
why haven't you done it yet?

1507
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:54,790
You're one of those guys.
You have fox something.

1508
01:06:54,820 --> 01:06:56,560
There's a force.
A lot of people are scared,

1509
01:06:56,570 --> 01:06:57,670
man,
scared of themselves.

1510
01:06:57,990 --> 01:06:58,540
Uh,
I,

1511
01:06:58,541 --> 01:07:00,040
yeah.
I feel like I know my foot pretty well.

1512
01:07:00,050 --> 01:07:02,150
That tank is you buddy.
If you know yourself,

1513
01:07:02,151 --> 01:07:03,470
you've got to get to know yourself much 
better.

1514
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:05,450
Tank is,
especially if you're high.

1515
01:07:05,860 --> 01:07:10,860
The scariest most self soul searching 
moments I've ever had is alone in that 

1516
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:11,300
tank.
On a pot.

1517
01:07:11,301 --> 01:07:12,560
Brownie.
yeah.

1518
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:14,720
Because the marijuana,
when you,

1519
01:07:14,750 --> 01:07:19,750
when you eat it,
especially anything that's fucking with 

1520
01:07:19,750 --> 01:07:19,750
you,
anything that's in your head that you're

1521
01:07:19,750 --> 01:07:20,750
not happy with,
just gets exposed.

1522
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:22,850
You know,
that's the beauty of that tank.

1523
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:25,700
It's just like a,
it's just the,

1524
01:07:25,770 --> 01:07:30,770
like the best show for you to see.
That is your life.

1525
01:07:31,851 --> 01:07:32,750
That is like,
here.

1526
01:07:32,780 --> 01:07:34,250
Here is you.
This is you.

1527
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:36,470
We're going to put on a show and we're 
going to show you.

1528
01:07:36,471 --> 01:07:38,660
We're going to do a documentary on your 
life.

1529
01:07:38,860 --> 01:07:42,610
What changes did you make every result 
of?

1530
01:07:42,790 --> 01:07:47,320
I'm not talking about outlook.
I'm talking about talking about behavior

1531
01:07:48,250 --> 01:07:49,390
from the tank.
Yeah.

1532
01:07:49,590 --> 01:07:51,450
I think it slow.

1533
01:07:51,490 --> 01:07:54,400
Slowly but surely made me a nicer 
person.

1534
01:07:54,540 --> 01:07:55,200
For sure.
Yeah.

1535
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:57,640
Yeah.
Made me more humble.

1536
01:07:57,670 --> 01:08:00,910
I think all the psychedelic experiences 
make you humble.

1537
01:08:01,060 --> 01:08:06,060
They're all very humbling because 
they're very ego dissolving and there 

1538
01:08:06,060 --> 01:08:06,060
you know,
you,

1539
01:08:06,060 --> 01:08:08,350
you feel like you're connected with 
everything and when you come back you're

1540
01:08:08,650 --> 01:08:09,220
like,
wow,

1541
01:08:09,221 --> 01:08:11,930
just knowing that that experience 
exists,

1542
01:08:12,130 --> 01:08:14,650
you've heard that you've sought study 
where people that did shrooms,

1543
01:08:14,930 --> 01:08:15,980
like adult

1544
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:21,130
did it,
like conservative adults and I think 

1545
01:08:21,130 --> 01:08:24,491
seven of them,
seven out of 10 said it was one of the 

1546
01:08:24,491 --> 01:08:27,460
best spiritual experiences of their life
and they do it again.

1547
01:08:27,700 --> 01:08:28,880
It's beautiful.
Yeah,

1548
01:08:29,250 --> 01:08:29,880
no,
I agree.

1549
01:08:29,881 --> 01:08:34,881
I would encourage them.
I've always said I would encourage my 

1550
01:08:34,881 --> 01:08:34,881
kids to do sharp.
You know,

1551
01:08:34,881 --> 01:08:37,110
it's all about set and setting.
People have taken them in party ideas,

1552
01:08:37,111 --> 01:08:39,890
you know,
in a party saying and you know,

1553
01:08:39,900 --> 01:08:41,850
had a bad time.
Maybe they got too high.

1554
01:08:41,851 --> 01:08:46,851
It had a bad trip.
It's all what it's going to take you on 

1555
01:08:46,851 --> 01:08:49,761
a journey and you have to submit to the 
journey and you also have to be willing 

1556
01:08:49,761 --> 01:08:50,070
to go for a ride.
Man,

1557
01:08:50,071 --> 01:08:55,071
you can't try to resist it if you try to
resist it and hold it back or deny the 

1558
01:08:55,071 --> 01:08:57,120
things that it's exposing.
That's what a bad trip was all about,

1559
01:08:57,121 --> 01:08:59,580
you know,
that's the epitome of a bad trip.

1560
01:08:59,610 --> 01:09:02,190
I also think there's people that just 
shouldn't ever do it ever though.

1561
01:09:02,430 --> 01:09:07,430
Absolutely.
Like duncan saying yesterday that he 

1562
01:09:07,430 --> 01:09:09,030
wanted to not dose whatever large 
amounts of people,

1563
01:09:09,031 --> 01:09:10,830
you know,
he was talking about.

1564
01:09:10,831 --> 01:09:15,831
It's a really brilliant idea in 
injecting it into the common cold,

1565
01:09:16,170 --> 01:09:20,280
injecting lsd into the common cold.
So somehow when you got the common cold,

1566
01:09:20,281 --> 01:09:24,420
you also want in his vast lsd trip.
Wow.

1567
01:09:24,421 --> 01:09:25,440
That is brilliant.
Yeah.

1568
01:09:25,441 --> 01:09:27,820
Until you get some kid that has,
you know,

1569
01:09:27,821 --> 01:09:32,821
a whatever,
some kind of alzheimer's or not 

1570
01:09:32,821 --> 01:09:32,821
alzheimer's,
but uh,

1571
01:09:32,821 --> 01:09:34,050
autism.
And then he fucks him.

1572
01:09:34,051 --> 01:09:35,950
Yeah.
And then he goes out and shoots up

1573
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:41,500
a genius idea though.
The idea of spreading something 

1574
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:42,930
psychoactive through a cold.
Like I wonder if that's possible,

1575
01:09:42,940 --> 01:09:45,840
like just the idea of a cold.
To me it's so bizarre,

1576
01:09:46,020 --> 01:09:51,020
the idea that there's some invading 
organism that tries to shut your body 

1577
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:54,201
down and consuming.
You have to battle it with your immune 

1578
01:09:54,201 --> 01:09:56,961
system,
but the fact that maybe this invading 

1579
01:09:56,961 --> 01:09:56,961
army,
my kerrick psychedelic chemicals,

1580
01:09:56,970 --> 01:09:57,360
why not?

1581
01:09:57,590 --> 01:10:01,230
It's where the capital thing comes in 
again because capitalism,

1582
01:10:01,300 --> 01:10:02,280
cause they,
they,

1583
01:10:02,281 --> 01:10:05,050
it's,
they spend more money on boner pills and

1584
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:10,200
then they do on solving the common cold 
because there's just more money and 

1585
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:11,380
vulnerable probably aids research than,
than boner pills.

1586
01:10:11,381 --> 01:10:13,250
And it's like because there's just more 
money and it's like,

1587
01:10:13,251 --> 01:10:14,840
yeah,
but you're going to do more good.

1588
01:10:15,060 --> 01:10:16,570
What do you inherent good.

1589
01:10:16,630 --> 01:10:20,620
What do you think about the people that 
don't believe that hiv causes aids?

1590
01:10:20,650 --> 01:10:23,460
Have you ever heard of this argument?
Does,

1591
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:29,470
what the fuck is the guys?
And there's one doctor that's like a 

1592
01:10:29,470 --> 01:10:29,690
very well respected doctor.
UH,

1593
01:10:29,710 --> 01:10:34,710
and he's got this,
he's a teacher at the university of 

1594
01:10:34,710 --> 01:10:37,000
California in berkeley and he,
for whatever reason,

1595
01:10:37,001 --> 01:10:39,430
doesn't believe that hiv causes aids.

1596
01:10:40,790 --> 01:10:41,360
Yeah,
I mean,

1597
01:10:41,361 --> 01:10:46,361
again,
I think a lot all conspiracy theorists 

1598
01:10:46,361 --> 01:10:48,560
and all that shit is just about people 
going like they're lying.

1599
01:10:48,590 --> 01:10:53,590
It's like calling bullshit all the time 
so that you feel like you have the upper

1600
01:10:53,871 --> 01:10:54,200
hand

1601
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:56,640
peter duesberg.
yeah.

1602
01:10:56,641 --> 01:11:01,641
This is the only thing,
the only reason why I listened to this 

1603
01:11:01,641 --> 01:11:01,641
guy at all.
I mean I don't,

1604
01:11:01,641 --> 01:11:05,301
but the only reason why I would is that 
he's a phd professor of molecular 

1605
01:11:05,301 --> 01:11:06,870
biology at the university of California,
berkeley.

1606
01:11:06,930 --> 01:11:08,490
That sounds like a guy who knows things.

1607
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:13,880
Yeah.
But there's hundreds of guys that I 

1608
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:14,730
know.
It's just so funny when a guy like this,

1609
01:11:14,940 --> 01:11:19,940
like this is my point of view.
I'm in no way saying that hiv does not 

1610
01:11:19,940 --> 01:11:22,470
cause aids and nor would I ever.
What the fuck do I know?

1611
01:11:22,471 --> 01:11:26,190
I'm not A doctor.
So what freaks me out is when I read.

1612
01:11:26,191 --> 01:11:30,660
So you got a real nice dot.
You've got forums like a rattle snake.

1613
01:11:31,290 --> 01:11:36,290
This when a guy like this peter duesberg
guy who is way more educated than me in 

1614
01:11:36,290 --> 01:11:36,990
the subject,
you know,

1615
01:11:36,991 --> 01:11:41,130
and way smarter than me to when this guy
has some fucking,

1616
01:11:41,190 --> 01:11:41,960
you know,
all these,

1617
01:11:41,970 --> 01:11:45,120
uh,
website articles and all these published

1618
01:11:45,121 --> 01:11:50,121
papers on this shit.
And he believes that act was what was 

1619
01:11:50,121 --> 01:11:50,121
killing all these people back in the 
day.

1620
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,080
God bless.
Sounds it sounds completely nutty.

1621
01:11:54,130 --> 01:11:54,730
Uh,
yeah.

1622
01:11:54,731 --> 01:11:55,250
Got bluffing.

1623
01:11:56,010 --> 01:12:01,010
I mean,
he might be just as crazy as the person 

1624
01:12:01,010 --> 01:12:01,010
that's saying that the end of the world 
was going to happen two months ago,

1625
01:12:01,010 --> 01:12:01,010
you know?
No,

1626
01:12:01,010 --> 01:12:04,890
it's funny how much worse alcohol is for
you than aids says,

1627
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:09,900
look,
magic johnson is alive and kicking with 

1628
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:13,711
hiv,
but amy winehouse is dead as fuck 

1629
01:12:13,711 --> 01:12:13,711
alcohol.
yeah,

1630
01:12:13,711 --> 01:12:15,150
that's pretty interesting.
Uh,

1631
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:19,190
hiv aids is way more treatable.
Yeah.

1632
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:22,090
Alcohol then like the alcoholism.
Yeah.

1633
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:26,050
Alcoholism or even drug it certain like 
nobody wants to get aids.

1634
01:12:26,051 --> 01:12:27,130
Again,
alcoholics,

1635
01:12:27,131 --> 01:12:29,110
you have to keep them from going back to
getting it.

1636
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:32,000
Could you imagine if someone got aids 
and you cured them and they're like,

1637
01:12:32,020 --> 01:12:33,340
oh,
I just like to get some aids again.

1638
01:12:33,341 --> 01:12:34,960
Shit.
I got the itch for aids every day.

1639
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:37,220
What are you going this weekend?
Hey,

1640
01:12:37,330 --> 01:12:39,640
try not to get aids guys and try not to 
get aids,

1641
01:12:40,830 --> 01:12:42,410
but that's alcohol.
You a,

1642
01:12:42,470 --> 01:12:47,470
you gotta keep those people from 
crawling back into that fucking 

1643
01:12:47,470 --> 01:12:48,240
alcoholics depression?
No,

1644
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:50,830
I mean I do occasionally,
but I don't need it.

1645
01:12:50,990 --> 01:12:53,110
If I,
if I go out to dinner,

1646
01:12:53,111 --> 01:12:54,790
I might have a glass of wine or 
something like that.

1647
01:12:54,970 --> 01:12:57,220
If I go out with some friends and 
somebody wants to do a shot,

1648
01:12:57,221 --> 01:13:02,221
I usually don't say no,
but I could go the rest of my life 

1649
01:13:02,221 --> 01:13:02,290
without drinking the night be I feel the
exact same way.

1650
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:06,160
But the marijuana,
because the idea of,

1651
01:13:06,190 --> 01:13:06,860
of being

1652
01:13:07,010 --> 01:13:09,550
like,
I need a alcoholic,

1653
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:11,720
you know,
get rid of my inhibitions.

1654
01:13:12,050 --> 01:13:13,430
I don't really have any inhibitions.

1655
01:13:13,930 --> 01:13:15,770
Can shoot with your arms up in the air 
like that.

1656
01:13:15,810 --> 01:13:18,390
Exposing your armpits.
You don't give a fuck.

1657
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:20,260
I really like doesn't even have any 
inhibitions.

1658
01:13:20,550 --> 01:13:25,550
Look guys,
this is like some shit that you would 

1659
01:13:25,550 --> 01:13:25,550
say to a check right before you booked 
your car.

1660
01:13:25,550 --> 01:13:26,330
Oh,
a buddy of mine used to say the greatest

1661
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:28,320
pickup line.
You know this buddy.

1662
01:13:28,321 --> 01:13:29,340
I want to think about it.
Okay.

1663
01:13:29,341 --> 01:13:30,390
I'll know it as immediately.

1664
01:13:30,580 --> 01:13:32,010
He used to say,
um,

1665
01:13:32,620 --> 01:13:34,870
you,
he would go up to girls and go,

1666
01:13:35,350 --> 01:13:40,350
uh,
they say that spontaneity is a sign of 

1667
01:13:40,350 --> 01:13:43,891
intelligence and you strike me as a very
spontaneous person would say we go back 

1668
01:13:44,201 --> 01:13:48,250
to my place and fuck or something and it
would work.

1669
01:13:49,110 --> 01:13:49,960
Is that your ideas?

1670
01:13:50,140 --> 01:13:55,140
How often would listen?
We both intelligent here.

1671
01:13:57,220 --> 01:14:02,220
Let's cut the bullshit in a muffler 
hanging out there.

1672
01:14:04,830 --> 01:14:06,430
It was in the eighties,
the eighties.

1673
01:14:06,431 --> 01:14:08,740
This is pre a pre aids.
Nice.

1674
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:10,480
Which is raw dog.
Yeah.

1675
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:11,220
Rhonda,
a.

1676
01:14:11,350 --> 01:14:12,170
That's ted nugent

1677
01:14:12,170 --> 01:14:13,970
song.
Raw dog war hog.

1678
01:14:14,740 --> 01:14:16,130
One of his war.
So,

1679
01:14:16,131 --> 01:14:18,300
you know,
I watched a show,

1680
01:14:18,301 --> 01:14:23,301
jay.
Well this is one of the reasons why 

1681
01:14:23,301 --> 01:14:24,721
because I look,
I even from people that I disagree with 

1682
01:14:24,721 --> 01:14:26,530
them on some things I may agree with 
very much so and other things.

1683
01:14:26,531 --> 01:14:31,531
And one of the things I agree with him 
is he's a hunter and he gets all of his 

1684
01:14:31,531 --> 01:14:36,181
food from his own ranch.
He has this huge high fence set up with 

1685
01:14:36,181 --> 01:14:36,181
this,
like,

1686
01:14:36,181 --> 01:14:38,920
you know,
several thousand acres he owns and taxes

1687
01:14:38,921 --> 01:14:41,690
and he goes around on his ranch and 
shoots animals and eat.

1688
01:14:41,740 --> 01:14:44,780
That's what he eats.
He doesn't eat subsistence.

1689
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:47,290
Yeah.
I like the idea of that.

1690
01:14:47,330 --> 01:14:48,470
Yeah.
I love the,

1691
01:14:48,471 --> 01:14:53,471
you know,
the fact that this guy stands up for 

1692
01:14:53,471 --> 01:14:54,560
people that think that there's something
wrong with hunting,

1693
01:14:54,580 --> 01:14:59,580
you know,
and I think that's completely 

1694
01:14:59,580 --> 01:15:01,271
ridiculous.
I think if you're eating meat and then 

1695
01:15:01,271 --> 01:15:01,271
you're telling people that they 
shouldn't be hunting,

1696
01:15:01,271 --> 01:15:01,370
that's just fucking nonsense,
man.

1697
01:15:02,270 --> 01:15:03,620
It's ridiculous.
You know,

1698
01:15:03,621 --> 01:15:07,460
hunting is the.
If you want protein from animals,

1699
01:15:07,461 --> 01:15:09,560
that's probably the best way to get it 
for you.

1700
01:15:09,561 --> 01:15:11,390
And it's probably the best way to get it
for your head.

1701
01:15:11,391 --> 01:15:13,970
So you understand what the fuck meat is.
You know,

1702
01:15:14,030 --> 01:15:16,640
I mean,
the reason why american indians were,

1703
01:15:16,930 --> 01:15:21,930
were so vigilant when it came to using 
every single part of that animal because

1704
01:15:22,851 --> 01:15:25,070
they knew how god damn hard it was to 
get a deer.

1705
01:15:25,340 --> 01:15:27,230
You know,
you used every part of that animal.

1706
01:15:27,260 --> 01:15:28,710
Nothing went to waste.
Right.

1707
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:30,160
You know,
and we,

1708
01:15:30,190 --> 01:15:33,200
we have this incredibly wasteful 
society,

1709
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:38,440
incredibly wasteful attitude and I think
hunting and gathering up your own food 

1710
01:15:38,631 --> 01:15:40,070
just to,
you could put that in your hand.

1711
01:15:40,250 --> 01:15:42,470
That's really what you're eating.
This is where it comes from.

1712
01:15:42,620 --> 01:15:47,620
Well the other day about if they thought
the recession would change people's 

1713
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:50,940
character somewhat,
like if,

1714
01:15:50,980 --> 01:15:53,900
if,
if because of now that because it seemed

1715
01:15:53,901 --> 01:15:58,901
like everyone was rich for 10 years and 
now now it seems like everyone's poor 

1716
01:16:00,830 --> 01:16:05,830
and you hope,
I mean at least because I would drive 

1717
01:16:05,830 --> 01:16:07,490
around la and go like make a good living
and I don't have a bmw or I don't have a

1718
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:10,340
poor whatever these cars are and I would
always think why do people.

1719
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:15,520
So I'm hoping that it'll go back to.
I hope people's values will be less 

1720
01:16:17,361 --> 01:16:19,620
materialistic.
I kind,

1721
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:20,930
I mean I,
I could go either way.

1722
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:25,960
I can make an argument either for either
for either being likely to happen 

1723
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:29,660
because they're not going to stop 
promoting consumerism like

1724
01:16:29,870 --> 01:16:34,870
bore.
We're locked into a certain pattern of 

1725
01:16:34,870 --> 01:16:36,470
behavior and it would take something 
monumental shift that it would take some

1726
01:16:36,471 --> 01:16:39,710
19 sixties type shit.
Where's everybody got on acid?

1727
01:16:40,010 --> 01:16:41,330
It would really take something like 
that.

1728
01:16:41,331 --> 01:16:41,840
It would just something

1729
01:16:41,950 --> 01:16:44,190
that's ever going to happen again 
because I haven't.

1730
01:16:44,410 --> 01:16:49,240
I've just had a theory that those 
computers are two good shit's too sweet,

1731
01:16:49,241 --> 01:16:50,530
man.
Too fucking easy.

1732
01:16:50,860 --> 01:16:55,860
Sit in my house or go out and riot,
go out and pick it and go out and you 

1733
01:16:56,030 --> 01:16:59,740
have the reason those kids in london 
we're riding is because they fucking are

1734
01:16:59,741 --> 01:17:01,990
poor and they have nothing to do.

1735
01:17:02,150 --> 01:17:02,770
Listen,
there's a.

1736
01:17:02,780 --> 01:17:05,780
There's a thing going on in Florida 
right now where they have a real problem

1737
01:17:05,781 --> 01:17:08,990
with these pain management centers and 
what it is.

1738
01:17:09,140 --> 01:17:10,390
Legal drugs,
right?

1739
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:11,270
See cotton's.
Yeah.

1740
01:17:11,510 --> 01:17:15,200
You can get them at a pain management 
center where you go in and you literally

1741
01:17:15,201 --> 01:17:20,201
go to a doctor and then right next store
from the doctor after he writes you a 

1742
01:17:20,201 --> 01:17:20,201
prescription.
There's a pharmacy.

1743
01:17:20,201 --> 01:17:24,680
It's all inside the same building and 
what it is is they figured out a way to 

1744
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:25,550
make heroin in a pill form.
It's really that simple.

1745
01:17:25,730 --> 01:17:28,640
They figured out a way to make heroin in
a pill form and then it got released.

1746
01:17:28,820 --> 01:17:31,220
Well,
if someone ever does release,

1747
01:17:31,250 --> 01:17:33,980
whether it's sill assignment or whether 
whatever the fuck it is,

1748
01:17:34,190 --> 01:17:37,960
when they start releasing it as a 
medicine and they are working on that,

1749
01:17:37,970 --> 01:17:38,460
yeah,
they.

1750
01:17:38,530 --> 01:17:40,150
There was a thing a couple of weeks ago,
but yeah,

1751
01:17:40,250 --> 01:17:40,690
they are.

1752
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:43,810
I have the perfect dosage.
They have the dosage exactly.

1753
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:46,910
Not too much and that will get everyone 
nice and high.

1754
01:17:47,050 --> 01:17:52,050
What's going to happen is that shit's 
going to get out just like it gets out 

1755
01:17:52,050 --> 01:17:55,201
in Florida and I don't know what state 
it's going to be that it's going to be 

1756
01:17:55,201 --> 01:17:58,141
one state where the pharmaceutical 
companies make some fucking creepy deal 

1757
01:17:58,141 --> 01:18:00,370
with congressmen and senators and 
somehow or another they allow,

1758
01:18:00,371 --> 01:18:05,371
like in Florida,
doesn't have a database with the way 

1759
01:18:05,371 --> 01:18:05,371
Florida setup is.
You can be a doctor.

1760
01:18:05,371 --> 01:18:09,630
You could prescribe brian's and 
oxycontin's and then brian goes next 

1761
01:18:09,630 --> 01:18:09,630
door to me.
I'm a doctor.

1762
01:18:09,630 --> 01:18:11,560
I prescribed him oxycontin and he goes 
down the street and he just keeps going.

1763
01:18:11,740 --> 01:18:16,740
There's no database.
You just go to as many places you want 

1764
01:18:16,740 --> 01:18:16,740
as long as you know,
come in,

1765
01:18:16,740 --> 01:18:19,660
scratching your fucking skin off with 
blood coming out of your eyeballs.

1766
01:18:19,900 --> 01:18:21,310
They just move you onto the next.

1767
01:18:21,380 --> 01:18:22,670
Yeah,
but I don't think.

1768
01:18:22,671 --> 01:18:24,670
But even the cyber selling thing,
I think it's,

1769
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:28,040
if,
if you feel like your.

1770
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:31,180
I just feel like we're locked into this 
thing of like possession.

1771
01:18:31,890 --> 01:18:35,430
Well that's what would cure that.
Big groups of mushroom uses.

1772
01:18:36,780 --> 01:18:41,780
Mushrooms,
users getting together and forming 

1773
01:18:41,780 --> 01:18:43,911
communities of.
You can have a lot of people that have 

1774
01:18:43,911 --> 01:18:46,731
had these,
like changing these transforming love 

1775
01:18:46,731 --> 01:18:48,030
experiences where when you do mushrooms,
man,

1776
01:18:48,031 --> 01:18:49,910
you really do love everybody.
Man.

1777
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:54,060
You really have this joy for all things 
living around you in this,

1778
01:18:54,061 --> 01:18:58,050
this sense of this sense of a symbiosis,
a sense of uh,

1779
01:18:58,250 --> 01:19:00,180
uh,
connection with everything.

1780
01:19:00,181 --> 01:19:02,700
Whether it's the molecules of the air,
the grass,

1781
01:19:02,701 --> 01:19:03,940
the trees,
and this,

1782
01:19:03,941 --> 01:19:05,820
this,
this connection that you can't feel when

1783
01:19:05,821 --> 01:19:10,821
you're on it,
and it could be completely an illusion 

1784
01:19:10,821 --> 01:19:11,700
or whatever,
but alcohol is completely illusion to.

1785
01:19:11,701 --> 01:19:13,650
And the culture of alcohol.
Absolutely.

1786
01:19:13,651 --> 01:19:15,580
Shapes in area and the culture of

1787
01:19:15,610 --> 01:19:20,610
it makes you hate everyone around you.
Culture of silicide been with a graph 

1788
01:19:20,610 --> 01:19:24,991
and would be the best thing for,
for a society because that what alcohol 

1789
01:19:24,991 --> 01:19:25,090
does to you,
it makes you angry.

1790
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:25,720
No,
it actually,

1791
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:27,310
again,
it just makes me sleepy.

1792
01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:30,660
It just may.
I need energy and like I don't have a,

1793
01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:33,940
uh,
an excess of energy so I can't be like,

1794
01:19:33,941 --> 01:19:36,840
if I were going to do drugs,
I do cocaine or speed or something.

1795
01:19:37,030 --> 01:19:40,450
I've never done any of them,
but not do any drugs at all.

1796
01:19:40,460 --> 01:19:42,910
Nothing takes all.
Often I would do shrimps.

1797
01:19:43,380 --> 01:19:45,510
Well you shouldn't do shrooms if you 
take zoloft.

1798
01:19:45,570 --> 01:19:50,570
I believe that that's not good for you.
I believe that you're not supposed to 

1799
01:19:50,570 --> 01:19:50,570
combine those two.

1800
01:19:50,570 --> 01:19:52,220
Uh,
I haven't in a long time.

1801
01:19:52,980 --> 01:19:57,350
So how long have you been on zoloft?
Twelve year.

1802
01:19:57,560 --> 01:19:58,550
Wow.
Yeah.

1803
01:19:59,330 --> 01:20:00,770
What does that do for you?
Uh,

1804
01:20:00,950 --> 01:20:05,600
it makes me not want to cry.
It makes me not like,

1805
01:20:05,870 --> 01:20:09,060
it makes me just put paper over the 
mirrors.

1806
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:10,200
Yeah,
that's true.

1807
01:20:10,350 --> 01:20:10,770
Nice one.

1808
01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:14,660
Oh,
what do you hate?

1809
01:20:17,700 --> 01:20:22,700
Have you always been a sad person 
growing up or did you just get a little 

1810
01:20:22,700 --> 01:20:22,700
off after?
No,

1811
01:20:22,700 --> 01:20:24,930
I was always a sad person.
Did you ever try anything?

1812
01:20:24,931 --> 01:20:27,270
Like a regular exercise like running?
Yeah.

1813
01:20:27,340 --> 01:20:28,400
Did that help?
No.

1814
01:20:28,530 --> 01:20:29,580
No.
I mean it helps.

1815
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:32,070
Like in,
in the cocktail,

1816
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:35,010
I think I'm better off exercising than 
not.

1817
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:37,320
So it adds to it.
Yeah.

1818
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:38,940
But it,
but I don't,

1819
01:20:38,941 --> 01:20:43,380
but if I took nothing and just exercise,
I just get real,

1820
01:20:43,381 --> 01:20:44,130
like low energy,

1821
01:20:44,350 --> 01:20:47,110
zoloft,
particular look,

1822
01:20:47,111 --> 01:20:52,111
you guys couldn't be money.
Zoloft in particular has a supposed to 

1823
01:20:52,111 --> 01:20:53,800
have a psychotic effect when you 
introduced it to cocaine,

1824
01:20:54,070 --> 01:20:56,590
cocaine and zoloft together as supposed 
to be very bad.

1825
01:20:56,591 --> 01:20:57,920
People have psychotic episodes.

1826
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,020
Got it.
Yeah.

1827
01:20:59,021 --> 01:20:59,460
I mean,
I.

1828
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:01,500
There's no risk of me doing cocaine.
No.

1829
01:21:01,590 --> 01:21:03,020
Um,
but there's,

1830
01:21:03,110 --> 01:21:05,010
there's a real risk of me doing last.

1831
01:21:05,390 --> 01:21:06,110
Yeah,
you should.

1832
01:21:06,290 --> 01:21:09,200
You should find out about that from 
someone who also has it in.

1833
01:21:09,201 --> 01:21:09,560
Does it

1834
01:21:09,720 --> 01:21:11,760
now,
have you tried to take a break from it?

1835
01:21:11,790 --> 01:21:16,380
Like have you ever felt like I took a 
couple of years ago I took a break and I

1836
01:21:16,381 --> 01:21:21,381
remember I'd be out with my girlfriend 
at the time and just at dinner with her 

1837
01:21:22,531 --> 01:21:24,480
and her friends and I literally will be 
falling asleep.

1838
01:21:24,810 --> 01:21:29,810
Not because like the regular reasons guy
one guys want to fall asleep just 

1839
01:21:29,810 --> 01:21:30,450
because I,
I couldn't,

1840
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:33,000
I was.
So we're vegan at the time?

1841
01:21:33,270 --> 01:21:34,640
Uh,
no,

1842
01:21:35,090 --> 01:21:38,920
it's back when I was eating meat guys.
Fucking interesting.

1843
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:40,260
Um,
so,

1844
01:21:40,261 --> 01:21:41,670
uh,
but I even,

1845
01:21:41,671 --> 01:21:46,671
but I,
I just realized before I started taking 

1846
01:21:46,671 --> 01:21:48,801
that five htp stuff that I started 
taking reasonable and up my dosage of 

1847
01:21:48,801 --> 01:21:53,031
zoloft,
my neck and back and shoulders were 

1848
01:21:53,031 --> 01:21:55,200
fucking tight and knotted up all the 
time for like years.

1849
01:21:55,290 --> 01:22:00,290
How often do you exercise?
A couple times a week now I've been 

1850
01:22:00,290 --> 01:22:00,540
trying to extend.
It's like everyday.

1851
01:22:00,541 --> 01:22:02,440
But um,
because I want to,

1852
01:22:02,970 --> 01:22:03,750
I feel like,
you know,

1853
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:05,070
like I said,
I think it helps.

1854
01:22:05,410 --> 01:22:06,940
Did get a punching bag.
Oh,

1855
01:22:07,370 --> 01:22:09,970
greatest thing you can ever have.
He blog so much stress.

1856
01:22:10,120 --> 01:22:11,650
Get someone to teach you how to punch 
correctly,

1857
01:22:11,651 --> 01:22:13,420
get a punching bag and just beat the 
shit out of it.

1858
01:22:13,421 --> 01:22:16,010
You feel so good when you're done.
It's like ugh.

1859
01:22:16,290 --> 01:22:21,290
Like you know,
I mean when you get angry and what do 

1860
01:22:21,290 --> 01:22:21,290
people want to do?
They want to hit things.

1861
01:22:21,290 --> 01:22:21,820
You know,
there's nothing better than just beating

1862
01:22:21,821 --> 01:22:26,821
the fuck out of this inanimate object.
It just blows all that monkey dna out of

1863
01:22:27,011 --> 01:22:32,011
your system.
And then I feel like I'd break my wrist 

1864
01:22:32,011 --> 01:22:32,011
or something,
wrapped them up.

1865
01:22:32,011 --> 01:22:32,011
You wrap your wrists up.
Oh yeah,

1866
01:22:32,070 --> 01:22:33,160
yeah.
You take your hands.

1867
01:22:33,161 --> 01:22:38,161
It's not that hard.
They sell these a gel wraps that are 

1868
01:22:38,161 --> 01:22:41,221
pretty easy to,
to learn how to wrap your hands up and 

1869
01:22:41,221 --> 01:22:41,530
then if you're smart,
you put a little athletic tape over that

1870
01:22:41,531 --> 01:22:42,490
so it takes five minutes.

1871
01:22:42,890 --> 01:22:47,890
Okay,
well I go to the gold's gym in venice 

1872
01:22:47,890 --> 01:22:47,890
that did they have a bag?
The mecca body?

1873
01:22:47,890 --> 01:22:51,440
Do you do squats there?
I do the I do.

1874
01:22:51,441 --> 01:22:54,800
And I take an exercise class with a 
bunch of 40 year old women

1875
01:22:54,890 --> 01:22:58,100
that would actually be funny watching a 
guy just lifting very little weight,

1876
01:22:59,210 --> 01:23:00,530
screaming through it.

1877
01:23:01,300 --> 01:23:01,840
Uh,
yeah.

1878
01:23:01,841 --> 01:23:02,430
No,
I,

1879
01:23:02,440 --> 01:23:07,440
yeah,
I take it with a bunch of 40 year old 

1880
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:07,440
gets called body.
Yeah.

1881
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:07,820
And it's actually a great class.
It's,

1882
01:23:08,140 --> 01:23:10,180
it's,
it's on your,

1883
01:23:10,181 --> 01:23:13,240
but to be more attractive.
Shut your fucking mouth.

1884
01:23:14,530 --> 01:23:16,270
I got it.
All right.

1885
01:23:16,271 --> 01:23:21,271
So you'll enjoy this joe barbell right?
AdjusTable weights.

1886
01:23:21,890 --> 01:23:25,180
Put as much as you want.
My little little as much as you want.

1887
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:29,260
And then we do every muscle group in 
unison to music.

1888
01:23:29,500 --> 01:23:34,500
Okay.
So the weight is varied via the from 

1889
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:36,130
person to person.
Uh,

1890
01:23:36,220 --> 01:23:40,750
but the exercise is the same.
So you and you get every single group.

1891
01:23:41,020 --> 01:23:43,390
Now are there women in the class at lift
more than me.

1892
01:23:43,580 --> 01:23:45,010
Yeah,
there are.

1893
01:23:45,011 --> 01:23:47,050
Joe,
is that tough for me?

1894
01:23:47,380 --> 01:23:49,510
Yeah.
Joe is tough.

1895
01:23:49,511 --> 01:23:51,070
But uh,
I liked the class and,

1896
01:23:51,310 --> 01:23:56,310
and those bitches better watch their 
backs because I'm going up to the 40 

1897
01:23:56,310 --> 01:24:00,020
pound level when it comes to curls.
Gateway class

1898
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:04,560
says a lot for one arm.
It's doing it for two homes.

1899
01:24:04,561 --> 01:24:05,580
A lot of reps I would say.

1900
01:24:05,730 --> 01:24:06,180
Yeah.
No,

1901
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:08,220
I'm doing all right.
But that's the uh,

1902
01:24:08,221 --> 01:24:09,900
that's no good.
Hey joe,

1903
01:24:10,170 --> 01:24:12,570
I want to apologize.
But it's music.

1904
01:24:12,571 --> 01:24:14,640
It's like a whole thing because I don't 
know.

1905
01:24:14,700 --> 01:24:16,830
I know I basically figured out what to 
do,

1906
01:24:16,831 --> 01:24:20,100
but I like the hour and doing it.

1907
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:22,210
They make you do it,
you do it to them,

1908
01:24:22,211 --> 01:24:23,710
you follow up,
there's a teacher.

1909
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:26,710
Whereas when you're by yourself it's 
hard to motivate yourself.

1910
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:26,890
Yeah.

1911
01:24:27,150 --> 01:24:28,140
And,
and it's also,

1912
01:24:28,141 --> 01:24:32,520
I would like take a break and go get 
some water and like this is like go,

1913
01:24:32,521 --> 01:24:32,910
go,
go,

1914
01:24:32,911 --> 01:24:33,360
go,
go.

1915
01:24:34,040 --> 01:24:34,710
It's a good class.

1916
01:24:35,450 --> 01:24:38,610
Those fucking classes are hard man.
You can poopoo them all you want.

1917
01:24:38,611 --> 01:24:39,580
But a lot of those.
Yeah,

1918
01:24:39,620 --> 01:24:44,620
that's what they pulled out the steps 
and you start stepping up and down and 

1919
01:24:44,620 --> 01:24:46,020
throwing punches.
That shit's fucking difficult.

1920
01:24:46,021 --> 01:24:46,230
Yeah,

1921
01:24:46,380 --> 01:24:46,970
that's,
it's.

1922
01:24:47,710 --> 01:24:50,170
Well I think girls just like,
it's that group thing,

1923
01:24:50,171 --> 01:24:52,890
like they like going to the bathroom to 
get a name,

1924
01:24:52,891 --> 01:24:54,640
like doing shit together.
Yes.

1925
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:57,130
A worth guys.
They yell at each other though.

1926
01:24:57,670 --> 01:24:58,690
What do you mean?
Just in general,

1927
01:24:58,710 --> 01:25:02,070
mrs rogan goes to the gym,
there's a Bunch of caddy cons,

1928
01:25:02,260 --> 01:25:06,290
a bunch of these uh,
mostly name is the name of the chair and

1929
01:25:06,300 --> 01:25:08,520
the day hunt.
Yeah it is.

1930
01:25:09,180 --> 01:25:13,080
Look it up on yellow pages and they 
fucking yell over who gets what spot and

1931
01:25:13,081 --> 01:25:15,540
you know,
they try to steal the right spots,

1932
01:25:15,570 --> 01:25:17,780
the room and they yell at each other 
when they throw kicks.

1933
01:25:18,990 --> 01:25:23,990
I have a theory that women would be 
better off if they could punch each 

1934
01:25:23,990 --> 01:25:25,620
other in the face.
All that like snapping and cattiness.

1935
01:25:25,621 --> 01:25:27,540
We'd go out the window.
That's why guys aren't,

1936
01:25:27,700 --> 01:25:31,500
is cause we,
cause I know if I do it more than twice,

1937
01:25:31,530 --> 01:25:36,000
you're going to punch me and,
and there is nothing legislating women's

1938
01:25:36,540 --> 01:25:39,030
behavior that way.
There is with guys.

1939
01:25:39,031 --> 01:25:44,031
I've had guys on the set of,
of tv shows that I was in charge of.

1940
01:25:44,460 --> 01:25:49,460
There was a sound guy named charles who 
I sort of snapped at one time and he 

1941
01:25:49,460 --> 01:25:49,980
looked at me like,
you know,

1942
01:25:49,981 --> 01:25:52,890
I will fuck you up.
And I never snapped at him again.

1943
01:25:53,540 --> 01:25:54,860
It was one of,
I just think it's like,

1944
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:57,440
it's a good thing to checked.
Yeah.

1945
01:25:57,450 --> 01:26:00,450
It's just as long as you know it's a 
possibility.

1946
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:04,130
It's true.
like it helps regulate behavior.

1947
01:26:04,130 --> 01:26:09,130
I'm not saying that they ever should.
I think it's always wrong to hit a 

1948
01:26:09,130 --> 01:26:09,130
woman,
but uh,

1949
01:26:09,130 --> 01:26:10,220
you know,
what regulates black chicks,

1950
01:26:10,510 --> 01:26:14,440
black chicks regulated video that I made
a video that I made in the.

1951
01:26:14,570 --> 01:26:17,170
Where the fuck was in milwaukee.
There was a,

1952
01:26:17,180 --> 01:26:22,180
I did a show me walking afterwards.
I just went out and took pictures of 

1953
01:26:22,180 --> 01:26:23,810
people for an hour and a half and these 
black chicks guarded me.

1954
01:26:24,020 --> 01:26:29,020
They put their back to the crowd and 
like student a semicircle and created 

1955
01:26:29,020 --> 01:26:30,650
this system where the people had to go 
through them this way.

1956
01:26:30,830 --> 01:26:35,830
And when you entered in,
you entered in only from here and then 

1957
01:26:35,830 --> 01:26:35,830
you left only that way.
It was really funny.

1958
01:26:35,830 --> 01:26:40,601
They were hilarious.
So I made a video with them afterwards 

1959
01:26:40,601 --> 01:26:41,720
to my youtube.
They will,

1960
01:26:41,780 --> 01:26:46,190
they will fight my youtube channel's joe
rogan.net.net.

1961
01:26:46,590 --> 01:26:47,500
There's a video,
I don't knoW.

1962
01:26:47,560 --> 01:26:52,400
It says something about joe rogan shows 
love to the milwaukee something,

1963
01:26:52,401 --> 01:26:55,970
some stupid fucking some stupid title.
There's nothing you can do.

1964
01:26:56,090 --> 01:27:01,090
You just have to be stupid.
Did I tell you I'm going to be in 

1965
01:27:01,090 --> 01:27:03,131
baltimore next week.
Are you going to be more comedy factory 

1966
01:27:07,791 --> 01:27:09,800
guys?
What is the baltimore common factor?

1967
01:27:09,801 --> 01:27:11,510
It's a new club,
I believe.

1968
01:27:11,511 --> 01:27:14,840
Nice.
Because for awhile they only had the um,

1969
01:27:15,320 --> 01:27:20,320
they only had a in baltimore.
They had the improv in the improv went 

1970
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:20,320
under and I had never heard about 
anything else.

1971
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:25,131
I think it replaced the improv really.
Is the improv the one that you went to 

1972
01:27:25,131 --> 01:27:29,230
like maybe nine years ago?
We went a long time ago and it was like 

1973
01:27:29,230 --> 01:27:30,320
a whole outdoor courtyard area with a 
bunch of bars and stuff.

1974
01:27:30,321 --> 01:27:31,150
Yeah,
that's exactly what.

1975
01:27:31,170 --> 01:27:33,410
Yeah,
that place was dope at the same place.

1976
01:27:33,860 --> 01:27:35,300
it's where the improv used to be.

1977
01:27:35,870 --> 01:27:37,460
Oh,
what a great spot.

1978
01:27:37,461 --> 01:27:38,660
That's that.
That's a great spot.

1979
01:27:39,080 --> 01:27:40,000
Apparently.
It's nice.

1980
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:41,240
Okay.
So what is it called again?

1981
01:27:41,750 --> 01:27:44,050
The comedy factory in baltimore.
The baltimore county factor.

1982
01:27:44,090 --> 01:27:45,590
And what days are you there?
Eight.

1983
01:27:45,690 --> 01:27:49,220
Twenty five through eight slash 27,
which is next thursday,

1984
01:27:49,490 --> 01:27:51,080
friday,
saturday.

1985
01:27:51,110 --> 01:27:56,110
Folks don't miss this tremendous 
opportunity to see neil brennan.

1986
01:27:56,900 --> 01:28:00,500
I personally talk about capitalism.
I don't talk about my dick.

1987
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:04,130
You can talk about the ladies.
I will talk about politics.

1988
01:28:04,210 --> 01:28:06,800
Obama,
you can argue with his socialist.

1989
01:28:06,801 --> 01:28:10,610
Ask in person.
I'm noT sure that I spoke to him for all

1990
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:15,640
his social ideals,
but it just seems like people don't like

1991
01:28:15,651 --> 01:28:17,660
it without thinking about it.
You know what I think,

1992
01:28:17,661 --> 01:28:22,661
man,
I think you need to concentrate on 

1993
01:28:22,661 --> 01:28:22,661
yourself.
That's what I think.

1994
01:28:22,661 --> 01:28:22,661
I think it's a very complex system.
It's very fucked up.

1995
01:28:22,661 --> 01:28:23,000
There's lot of things wrong with it.

1996
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:24,320
The big,
the big question.

1997
01:28:24,321 --> 01:28:26,240
The big key is how do you make yourself 
happy?

1998
01:28:26,300 --> 01:28:28,640
Because nobody else has to figure it out
on their own as well.

1999
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:30,950
And how you make yourself happy and 
that's,

2000
01:28:30,951 --> 01:28:35,951
you know,
everyone has their own unique answer to 

2001
01:28:35,951 --> 01:28:38,051
that question,
but how do you make all these other 

2002
01:28:38,051 --> 01:28:38,051
people happy?
Man,

2003
01:28:38,051 --> 01:28:38,720
I'm not so sure it's socialism.
I don't think that would work at all.

2004
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:43,960
I'm not so sure it's making everybody 
get paid the same amount of money for 

2005
01:28:43,960 --> 01:28:43,960
everything.
I don't think that would work either.

2006
01:28:43,960 --> 01:28:48,790
I think the reason why we have so much 
cool shit because there's a god damn 

2007
01:28:48,790 --> 01:28:49,520
race going on as competition going on.
Some people rise to the occasion,

2008
01:28:49,750 --> 01:28:54,750
absolutely,
but I feel like it's we punish those 

2009
01:28:54,750 --> 01:28:57,221
that don't know.
We have to figure out individually how 

2010
01:28:57,221 --> 01:28:57,221
to be happy.
That's what it is,

2011
01:28:57,221 --> 01:29:01,810
and we also have to figure out how to 
keep corporations from being so fucking 

2012
01:29:01,810 --> 01:29:01,830
corrupt and crooked that they are

2013
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:03,830
able to get away with shit to get there.

2014
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:09,480
Nothing's gonna stop because they're.
The corporations themselves are buying 

2015
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:11,410
messages saying,
don't touch us.

2016
01:29:11,470 --> 01:29:15,400
We provide jobs and that's all you care 
about and jobs will give you more.

2017
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:17,390
Not only that,
they're paying masses,

2018
01:29:17,420 --> 01:29:22,420
masses of money,
giant sums of money to help politicians 

2019
01:29:22,420 --> 01:29:24,230
tend to office lobbyists,
lobbyists,

2020
01:29:24,231 --> 01:29:26,600
campaign contributions.
The all of the above,

2021
01:29:27,130 --> 01:29:30,780
I believe that is a massive key is 
campaign finance reform.

2022
01:29:31,090 --> 01:29:36,090
Gary,
it's so scary that companies can just 

2023
01:29:36,090 --> 01:29:36,090
buy presidents.
You.

2024
01:29:36,090 --> 01:29:38,420
They could just have us convinced that 
bump we got to get into Pakistan.

2025
01:29:38,421 --> 01:29:40,850
There's a lot of shit going on.
Yeah.

2026
01:29:40,940 --> 01:29:41,930
By the way,
while we're there,

2027
01:29:41,931 --> 01:29:44,390
we just found trillions of dollars in 
minerals.

2028
01:29:44,420 --> 01:29:46,250
Oh wow.
We're coming from.

2029
01:29:46,290 --> 01:29:47,540
This is crazy.
Oh,

2030
01:29:47,541 --> 01:29:50,240
we found a natural gas pIpeline.
the biggest source of natural gas in the

2031
01:29:50,241 --> 01:29:53,150
world in Afghanistan.
We never even knew it was there folks.

2032
01:29:53,490 --> 01:29:55,370
I,
we never knew it was their next stop.

2033
01:29:55,371 --> 01:29:57,260
The Congo.
There's a lot of shit going on the Congo

2034
01:29:57,261 --> 01:30:00,520
and we got to get a lot of unrest.
We got to shut it down,

2035
01:30:00,680 --> 01:30:03,620
shut down,
find a shitload of minds.

2036
01:30:03,770 --> 01:30:06,680
The condo who fucked up the Congo so 
fucked up.

2037
01:30:06,681 --> 01:30:08,030
Even the United States government is 
like,

2038
01:30:08,031 --> 01:30:11,390
you know what?
I know you guys are making billions over

2039
01:30:11,391 --> 01:30:14,800
there,
but you can have that crazy part.

2040
01:30:15,860 --> 01:30:17,600
Is China going to war in the Congo?

2041
01:30:18,310 --> 01:30:19,660
A lot of.
In fact,

2042
01:30:19,720 --> 01:30:23,140
at one point I looked at my financial 
investments tonight.

2043
01:30:23,710 --> 01:30:26,800
I was invested in a company called petro
China,

2044
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:28,420
and I was like,
what is that?

2045
01:30:28,430 --> 01:30:31,070
And I went and they,
they uh,

2046
01:30:31,180 --> 01:30:35,080
god I want when I was investing in 
petrochina and uh,

2047
01:30:35,230 --> 01:30:40,230
like lockheed martin and that was a 
petrochina is,

2048
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:44,440
it's a chinese gas company,
but they'd get it all from africa.

2049
01:30:44,860 --> 01:30:48,480
They get it all from either the Congo or
uh,

2050
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:50,140
or,
or Nigeria.

2051
01:30:50,141 --> 01:30:51,190
just one of those dislikes.

2052
01:30:51,230 --> 01:30:52,620
The gas,
you mean petrol?

2053
01:30:52,650 --> 01:30:53,490
Yeah.
Wow.

2054
01:30:53,550 --> 01:30:54,270
So they're,
they're,

2055
01:30:54,271 --> 01:30:56,650
they're pumping it out of africa.
Yeah.

2056
01:30:57,020 --> 01:30:58,900
And they're,
they're buying,

2057
01:30:58,901 --> 01:31:00,940
you know,
it's like they'll pay both sides.

2058
01:31:00,941 --> 01:31:01,460
They,
they,

2059
01:31:01,480 --> 01:31:02,920
they bought the government there.
They've,

2060
01:31:03,410 --> 01:31:04,120
it's,
yeah.

2061
01:31:04,270 --> 01:31:06,660
It's crazy.
Yeah.

2062
01:31:06,850 --> 01:31:11,850
It's crazy.
And that's the thing is no one's gonna 

2063
01:31:11,850 --> 01:31:13,120
do anything because it's way easier to 
sit on your computer.

2064
01:31:13,360 --> 01:31:18,360
I have,
I have a theory that that crime went 

2065
01:31:18,360 --> 01:31:20,671
down when cable cable increased.
I believe that they are directly 

2066
01:31:20,671 --> 01:31:21,780
correlated.
I can't prove it in any way.

2067
01:31:21,860 --> 01:31:24,210
Giving people something to watch on tv 
makes less crime.

2068
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:26,630
Just people have shitty.
They go,

2069
01:31:26,631 --> 01:31:28,020
I want to get in and

2070
01:31:28,110 --> 01:31:29,260
involve.
I want to.

2071
01:31:29,261 --> 01:31:34,261
If you can get a laid with a lot of,
by inviting a girl over and all that 

2072
01:31:35,411 --> 01:31:38,800
shit and having shit to do with her,
I feel like that's,

2073
01:31:38,830 --> 01:31:42,030
you will get a regular job just so if 
you can,

2074
01:31:42,050 --> 01:31:46,390
if I can afford verizon,
time warner and whatever else,

2075
01:31:46,391 --> 01:31:49,310
I got to get them straight.
If I can get posey than I'm.

2076
01:31:49,460 --> 01:31:51,130
That's.
I have that budget.

2077
01:31:51,400 --> 01:31:53,830
That's my budget.
There's also the thing.

2078
01:31:53,831 --> 01:31:55,000
Did you see,
did you read,

2079
01:31:55,001 --> 01:31:58,630
um,
a focus on New York times book?

2080
01:31:59,080 --> 01:32:04,080
It was where they said the reason crime 
went down is because the crime started 

2081
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:08,161
going down in 91 and abortion was made 
legal in a 73 basically saying all the 

2082
01:32:15,791 --> 01:32:20,791
guys that would have been 18 and 
criminals were boarded up a.

2083
01:32:22,530 --> 01:32:22,940
Yeah.
Which is,

2084
01:32:23,610 --> 01:32:28,610
it's.
And it's in that book a freakonomics 

2085
01:32:28,610 --> 01:32:28,610
that's interested in the first edition 
of freakonomics.

2086
01:32:28,610 --> 01:32:30,440
And you just go and they did it.
Cool.

2087
01:32:30,580 --> 01:32:35,580
You know what's crazy?
They did it by state because certain 

2088
01:32:35,580 --> 01:32:39,181
states legalize it sooner and those 
states crime started dropping center to 

2089
01:32:40,450 --> 01:32:45,450
the month holy.
Which is like one of those things where 

2090
01:32:45,450 --> 01:32:45,450
you go,
wow,

2091
01:32:45,450 --> 01:32:46,990
that's fucking awesome.
If that's true,

2092
01:32:47,470 --> 01:32:49,560
right?
It's awesome.

2093
01:32:49,570 --> 01:32:50,440
I mean,
and people go,

2094
01:32:50,441 --> 01:32:52,890
that's human,
that's human engineering,

2095
01:32:52,900 --> 01:32:54,490
whatever,
But It's like social engineering,

2096
01:32:54,700 --> 01:32:55,810
social engineering,
but it's like,

2097
01:32:56,290 --> 01:32:58,300
I don't.
If you don't want a baby,

2098
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:01,690
go ahead and I'm going to take your word
for it.

2099
01:33:02,290 --> 01:33:04,480
You're going to say,
I'm going to be a bad parent.

2100
01:33:04,481 --> 01:33:05,530
I'm going to go ahead and take your work

2101
01:33:05,590 --> 01:33:10,000
for real problem with abortion becomes.
WheN do you say it's not legal?

2102
01:33:10,120 --> 01:33:11,910
At what point?
You know when?

2103
01:33:11,911 --> 01:33:14,470
When it's a baby inside.
Is it still legal?

2104
01:33:14,471 --> 01:33:14,730
No,
no,

2105
01:33:14,731 --> 01:33:15,670
no.
Not when it's a baby.

2106
01:33:15,671 --> 01:33:17,560
When you can see it.
It's a baby and it can exist outside the

2107
01:33:17,561 --> 01:33:18,220
womb.
Okay.

2108
01:33:18,221 --> 01:33:20,050
What a month before that.
Is it a baby then?

2109
01:33:20,370 --> 01:33:21,910
What about a month before that?
Is it a baby then?

2110
01:33:21,911 --> 01:33:23,980
It looks like a baby.
It looks a little immature baby.

2111
01:33:24,190 --> 01:33:27,420
When can you kill that?
Know that gets crazy.

2112
01:33:27,660 --> 01:33:28,020
Well,
yeah.

2113
01:33:28,021 --> 01:33:29,220
That's one of those arguments.
It's like,

2114
01:33:29,221 --> 01:33:30,570
well,
once you start having it,

2115
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:35,600
there's no good.
You can't tell me like it's just a 

2116
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:35,760
protozoa.
It's like once this pharmacy a,

2117
01:33:36,170 --> 01:33:37,200
it's a,
it's a,

2118
01:33:37,320 --> 01:33:40,410
it's a.
As much as I don'T connect to it.

2119
01:33:40,411 --> 01:33:43,660
When it's a bunch of seeds,
drop it out.

2120
01:33:43,900 --> 01:33:48,900
It doesn't seem to me.
There are people that do believe that 

2121
01:33:48,900 --> 01:33:48,900
you can connect to it.
Yes.

2122
01:33:48,990 --> 01:33:53,990
I've heard that.
The sperm and the egg and the just the 

2123
01:33:53,990 --> 01:33:53,990
thing splitting and splitting and 
splitting it.

2124
01:33:53,990 --> 01:33:58,030
Like you'd go that that's a person.
Some folks believe it's like the 49.

2125
01:33:59,090 --> 01:34:01,260
No.
Well that's the thing is once you.

2126
01:34:01,320 --> 01:34:06,320
You can keep going back,
you can keep going back to it anytime 

2127
01:34:06,320 --> 01:34:06,890
you jerk off.
It's important.

2128
01:34:07,060 --> 01:34:08,820
Yeah.
I think they whole abortion rate.

2129
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:13,830
That's why I call my bathroom the 
abortion clinic because I go in there.

2130
01:34:13,890 --> 01:34:18,890
I jerk of joe's typing,
but he would have given me a big laugh 

2131
01:34:18,890 --> 01:34:18,890
on that.
I believe.

2132
01:34:19,230 --> 01:34:22,530
No abortion clinic.
Nothing we can say.

2133
01:34:22,920 --> 01:34:27,920
I don't know.
I was going to say I wish there was a 

2134
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:28,470
camera that you can like in like check 
to see if it's like retarded.

2135
01:34:28,500 --> 01:34:28,850
Like,
like,

2136
01:34:28,890 --> 01:34:33,890
like I just have a space there.
Tests and yeah,

2137
01:34:34,140 --> 01:34:36,210
you can test,
so it's not 100 percent now like you'll,

2138
01:34:36,290 --> 01:34:38,620
you'll know it's retarded.
It's,

2139
01:34:39,170 --> 01:34:44,170
they put it euphemistically,
but it is basically your child's going 

2140
01:34:44,170 --> 01:34:47,970
to be a to say brain damage,
disabled,

2141
01:34:47,971 --> 01:34:48,990
whatever,
and people,

2142
01:34:49,290 --> 01:34:54,290
people,
a lot of people get abortions because 

2143
01:34:54,290 --> 01:34:54,290
of.

2144
01:34:54,290 --> 01:34:56,180
Yeah,
I'm the sole is supposed to enter the 

2145
01:34:56,180 --> 01:34:58,941
body and 120th day of pregnancy,
that's the yogis believe that the pineal

2146
01:35:00,111 --> 01:35:03,920
gland comes from the hundred and 20th 
day 919.

2147
01:35:03,921 --> 01:35:08,921
So you can get rid of the baby before 
that and it's just a like how it made 

2148
01:35:08,921 --> 01:35:11,260
answers that the soul enters what 
happens to the soul.

2149
01:35:11,261 --> 01:35:16,261
I feel like it's got like a bus ticket 
and it goes and it's on its way to the 

2150
01:35:16,261 --> 01:35:17,820
baby's house.
One hundred 20 days there.

2151
01:35:17,850 --> 01:35:18,920
It's got a suitcase.
I'm,

2152
01:35:18,921 --> 01:35:20,120
hello?
I'm here.

2153
01:35:20,240 --> 01:35:21,350
Where's the fucking baby?

2154
01:35:23,030 --> 01:35:23,760
Yeah,
where's the soul?

2155
01:35:23,761 --> 01:35:28,761
Good.
Is it just go out and fart gun in the 

2156
01:35:28,761 --> 01:35:28,761
air?
It goes away.

2157
01:35:28,761 --> 01:35:30,110
It goes back.
It goes back to the river souls.

2158
01:35:30,490 --> 01:35:33,540
Hopefully that's the,
that the uh,

2159
01:35:33,570 --> 01:35:35,250
yeah.
it's like either you're for or against,

2160
01:35:35,251 --> 01:35:36,030
but all that stuff,

2161
01:35:36,080 --> 01:35:38,970
like not necessarily think either you're
for it or against it.

2162
01:35:38,971 --> 01:35:43,971
I think there's a rational argument that
could be said that after a certain 

2163
01:35:43,971 --> 01:35:44,010
amount of time you shouldn't be able to 
do it.

2164
01:35:44,330 --> 01:35:45,210
You know,
these late term,

2165
01:35:45,211 --> 01:35:47,880
pre at any fucking.
Linda's got fingers,

2166
01:35:47,881 --> 01:35:51,050
man.
Did you use eyeball documentary?

2167
01:35:51,060 --> 01:35:56,060
The lake of fire.
That's one of the best documentaries 

2168
01:35:56,060 --> 01:35:56,060
I've ever seen.
This guy,

2169
01:35:56,060 --> 01:35:59,121
tony kaye directed it who directed 
american history x and it's a bit of a 

2170
01:35:59,121 --> 01:36:02,871
lunatic,
but he made a two and a half hour 

2171
01:36:02,871 --> 01:36:03,780
documentary about abortion over that 
took place.

2172
01:36:03,870 --> 01:36:06,000
He shouted over like 10 years.
So uh,

2173
01:36:06,430 --> 01:36:11,430
any he focused on both sides.
And when you come away with is it's 

2174
01:36:11,430 --> 01:36:14,430
fucking brutal weather whether you're 
for it or against it,

2175
01:36:14,790 --> 01:36:16,830
you know,
when they do an abortion,

2176
01:36:16,831 --> 01:36:21,330
they and they,
they have to find all of the parts in a,

2177
01:36:21,420 --> 01:36:26,420
they have,
they put it on like a medical thing and 

2178
01:36:26,420 --> 01:36:26,940
the nurse has defined two legs,
two arms,

2179
01:36:27,630 --> 01:36:30,600
like just read this go.
That is so awful.

2180
01:36:30,900 --> 01:36:35,900
I can't believe,
but it's such a joy to watch the 

2181
01:36:35,900 --> 01:36:35,900
documentary.
Hopefully it's unknown.

2182
01:36:35,900 --> 01:36:39,050
What's it called again?
Lake of fire and why they call it lake 

2183
01:36:39,050 --> 01:36:39,050
of fire.
Uh,

2184
01:36:39,050 --> 01:36:40,950
it based on the song and the biblical,
uh,

2185
01:36:40,980 --> 01:36:43,470
based on the bIblical thing that people 
that,

2186
01:36:44,040 --> 01:36:45,540
that some don't.
Some,

2187
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:46,800
some biblical phrase.

2188
01:36:47,350 --> 01:36:52,350
Yeah.
This looks funny subject because when 

2189
01:36:52,350 --> 01:36:54,080
you bring it up,
the ultra liberal amongst us will,

2190
01:36:54,081 --> 01:36:57,430
will never let you say that.
It might be bad.

2191
01:36:57,550 --> 01:36:58,140
No.
Well that's good.

2192
01:36:58,160 --> 01:37:00,370
The thing is I am liberal button.
What I'm,

2193
01:37:00,371 --> 01:37:01,180
I'm,
I'm,

2194
01:37:01,210 --> 01:37:02,470
it's one of those things where I just 
go,

2195
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:03,420
wow,
I'm,

2196
01:37:03,480 --> 01:37:04,750
I'm,
I'm for it.

2197
01:37:04,751 --> 01:37:06,950
But I'm not like for it.
I believe it should be allowed,

2198
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:10,780
but I'm not like,
I'm not on some like you fucking,

2199
01:37:10,810 --> 01:37:11,900
you know,
you had,

2200
01:37:11,910 --> 01:37:16,910
you stand up as the best joke about it 
where the people are for it in case of 

2201
01:37:17,500 --> 01:37:19,420
incest or rape.
And he's like,

2202
01:37:19,421 --> 01:37:22,630
so you're for it.
If the dad is an asshole,

2203
01:37:23,740 --> 01:37:26,200
that's what he's saying.
Like if the dad's an asshole then you're

2204
01:37:26,201 --> 01:37:29,070
for it.
But if the dads nice guy than your,

2205
01:37:29,130 --> 01:37:31,450
than your foot.
But because it's just as much a life,

2206
01:37:32,050 --> 01:37:33,750
if the guy raped or insensitive,

2207
01:37:33,790 --> 01:37:36,020
the baby shouldn't be responsible for 
its data.

2208
01:37:36,060 --> 01:37:39,940
And for the dad being a dick,
that is an interesting way of looking at

2209
01:37:39,941 --> 01:37:44,941
it.
You allow It under some circumstances 

2210
01:37:44,941 --> 01:37:47,161
where you shouldn't.
A man can't be forced to make a woman 

2211
01:37:47,161 --> 01:37:47,200
carry the life.
Right?

2212
01:37:47,740 --> 01:37:48,730
Yeah.
That's a weird thing.

2213
01:37:48,731 --> 01:37:53,731
Like saying that,
that's like some tribal shit that's not 

2214
01:37:53,731 --> 01:37:53,731
very spiritual thinking that that's okay
to kill people.

2215
01:37:53,731 --> 01:37:54,930
Then,
you know,

2216
01:37:55,510 --> 01:37:55,860
we met.

2217
01:37:56,010 --> 01:37:57,480
Sorry baby.
Yeah,

2218
01:37:57,481 --> 01:37:58,860
sorry.
I know you're just a baby.

2219
01:37:58,861 --> 01:38:00,900
But if you believe it's.
I'm sorry,

2220
01:38:00,901 --> 01:38:02,760
fetus will go fetus.
But yeah,

2221
01:38:02,761 --> 01:38:05,460
that's the thing is I was having watched
that documentary.

2222
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:08,790
I'm still for it,
but it's a bit.

2223
01:38:08,850 --> 01:38:10,080
Uh,
it's my,

2224
01:38:10,110 --> 01:38:14,330
my point of view is way more shaded and 
nuanced than,

2225
01:38:14,420 --> 01:38:16,370
than it would be than it was before I 
saw the dog.

2226
01:38:16,460 --> 01:38:19,220
I don't think I have a right to tell you
what you can do with your body,

2227
01:38:19,250 --> 01:38:22,220
but I think it should be discussed when 
it gets crazy.

2228
01:38:22,370 --> 01:38:22,810
You know,
I,

2229
01:38:22,811 --> 01:38:27,811
I have a buddy who is a,
he was dating a girl and she had a late 

2230
01:38:27,811 --> 01:38:31,190
term abortion where she had to go to 
some illegal place and do it.

2231
01:38:31,550 --> 01:38:36,550
I don't know why they chose to,
but she was fucking pregnant and they 

2232
01:38:36,550 --> 01:38:36,770
killed that baby.
You know that.

2233
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:38,480
That freaked me out.
Man.

2234
01:38:38,490 --> 01:38:39,680
Did.
What did your buddy think?

2235
01:38:40,100 --> 01:38:43,710
I don't remember because you know,
I haven't talked to him in forever and I

2236
01:38:43,711 --> 01:38:48,711
don't.
I tried not to really question it than 

2237
01:38:48,711 --> 01:38:50,690
if it was happening now.
There's no way I would not be able to,

2238
01:38:50,691 --> 01:38:55,691
but you know,
back then it was 23 years old and I was 

2239
01:38:55,691 --> 01:38:58,061
just like freaked out the front and this
lady was fucking pregnant and they're 

2240
01:38:58,061 --> 01:38:59,600
going to suck that baby out of her and 
some illegal place.

2241
01:39:00,050 --> 01:39:00,650
Yeah,
no,

2242
01:39:00,680 --> 01:39:02,620
that shit is that.
I mean,

2243
01:39:02,810 --> 01:39:04,460
no matter what,
that's evil.

2244
01:39:04,550 --> 01:39:09,550
There's,
there's an you don't want to accept 

2245
01:39:09,550 --> 01:39:09,550
reality at that point is what's going 
on.

2246
01:39:09,550 --> 01:39:12,340
You've decided to try to change reality.
Is there an out

2247
01:39:12,640 --> 01:39:15,820
that's one of those blind spots though 
that we live with all the time.

2248
01:39:16,550 --> 01:39:17,830
Like,
but yeah,

2249
01:39:17,831 --> 01:39:19,930
there's tons of things we do that are 
just like,

2250
01:39:20,140 --> 01:39:24,130
that's pretty fucked up that you just 
walk past homeless people.

2251
01:39:24,131 --> 01:39:26,560
You walk past poor people,
you walk and you just go,

2252
01:39:26,561 --> 01:39:27,180
ah,
fuck.

2253
01:39:27,550 --> 01:39:30,010
The numbers are too great.
If there was only a few of us,

2254
01:39:30,011 --> 01:39:31,090
we wouldn't do that.
You know?

2255
01:39:31,190 --> 01:39:36,190
I've always said that people lived,
they should be in tribes have like 500 

2256
01:39:36,190 --> 01:39:37,570
monkey people.
that's what we're supposed to be.

2257
01:39:37,750 --> 01:39:41,020
500 tribes have a few hundred people 
where we all know each other very well.

2258
01:39:41,500 --> 01:39:42,190
That's normal

2259
01:39:42,350 --> 01:39:45,720
and I believe that women would stay in,
raise the babies.

2260
01:39:45,721 --> 01:39:50,721
I honestly believe that the way 
guerrilla style where it's like the 

2261
01:39:50,721 --> 01:39:51,000
women,
all the women gorillas stay.

2262
01:39:51,001 --> 01:39:56,001
They want the babies in the guys just do
the parameter standup perimeter and 

2263
01:39:56,001 --> 01:39:57,720
fight and fight and protect.

2264
01:39:57,740 --> 01:39:58,730
That's what it's always been,
man.

2265
01:39:58,760 --> 01:40:00,050
Yeah.
It's always been like that.

2266
01:40:00,051 --> 01:40:05,051
It's just we have that same genetics,
but now we're in these giant groups of 

2267
01:40:05,051 --> 01:40:08,381
300 million people pushed together onto 
this one continent and we're confused.

2268
01:40:08,661 --> 01:40:13,661
We're confused as to how to behave.
We have all these weird instincts to 

2269
01:40:13,661 --> 01:40:14,990
fuck everything and kill your enemies 
and everything,

2270
01:40:14,991 --> 01:40:15,340
but yeah.

2271
01:40:15,550 --> 01:40:16,380
Yeah,
but you can't.

2272
01:40:16,420 --> 01:40:17,710
That's what I've been doing a joke 
about.

2273
01:40:17,711 --> 01:40:22,420
Like they that it used to be.
now we have to be romantic to get women,

2274
01:40:22,660 --> 01:40:27,660
but it used to be all we had to do 
before it was just chased them down and 

2275
01:40:27,660 --> 01:40:31,771
send to them.
There's a reason why men are stronger 

2276
01:40:31,771 --> 01:40:31,771
than.
Well,

2277
01:40:31,771 --> 01:40:31,771
no,
I know.

2278
01:40:31,771 --> 01:40:31,771
That's what the are superior.
That was it.

2279
01:40:31,771 --> 01:40:32,890
Like that was a date.
Yeah.

2280
01:40:33,070 --> 01:40:36,310
Was just a chase was just.
That's why chase scenes work in movies.

2281
01:40:36,530 --> 01:40:41,530
Well,
that's why dirty girls like to get 

2282
01:40:41,530 --> 01:40:41,730
fucking choked ad where the guy I got,
I gotta be honest.

2283
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:43,330
We talked.
I don't know if we don't as last time.

2284
01:40:43,540 --> 01:40:44,290
It's,
it's,

2285
01:40:44,380 --> 01:40:47,620
it's not just dirty girls anymore.
It's not.

2286
01:40:47,621 --> 01:40:49,490
You haven't been out in,
out,

2287
01:40:49,491 --> 01:40:52,100
out since that real internet.
Since you porn.

2288
01:40:52,330 --> 01:40:53,980
Girls want to choked.
I don't

2289
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:57,720
know if all of them do,
but a lot of girls want to want to get.

2290
01:40:57,760 --> 01:41:01,750
I could trust me really,
like I don't know what

2291
01:41:01,780 --> 01:41:03,960
your experience has been,
but it's been a,

2292
01:41:04,120 --> 01:41:06,370
maybe it's my,
my credits or something,

2293
01:41:06,371 --> 01:41:10,390
but it doesn't take long for them to 
bring it up.

2294
01:41:10,670 --> 01:41:11,690
I don't,
I've never,

2295
01:41:11,691 --> 01:41:13,580
I wAsn't doing it.
And then I.

2296
01:41:13,820 --> 01:41:18,820
And then I slowly but surely like when 
you're saying choke you mean grabbed 

2297
01:41:18,820 --> 01:41:21,821
them physically by the neck and choke 
them while I'm talking about in to 

2298
01:41:21,821 --> 01:41:26,080
linkedin,
but it's not real choke unless you're 

2299
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:26,080
doing real quick.
Like,

2300
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:29,590
like I,
I do choke but it's more like I'm just 

2301
01:41:29,590 --> 01:41:29,590
zach just like,
hey,

2302
01:41:29,590 --> 01:41:32,890
I'm choking you make a face.
You know,

2303
01:41:32,990 --> 01:41:37,670
girls slapped,
choke a fuck that shit.

2304
01:41:37,671 --> 01:41:39,810
It's all gone.
So now it's all gone.

2305
01:41:39,811 --> 01:41:41,510
So at the beginning,
because it might be your crowd though,

2306
01:41:41,511 --> 01:41:46,511
dude might be attracting a crowd is like
literate and fucking they liked hip hop.

2307
01:41:47,721 --> 01:41:52,721
I don't know who my credits,
but I do imagine that I'm cool with 

2308
01:41:54,021 --> 01:41:55,700
black label.
Most of them are white now.

2309
01:41:55,730 --> 01:41:58,070
You know what's funny is he ever look at
your crowd and go like,

2310
01:41:58,100 --> 01:41:58,910
wow.
ReallY?

2311
01:41:58,970 --> 01:41:59,780
Like it's just,
you just,

2312
01:41:59,840 --> 01:42:00,740
it's people that if you

2313
01:42:00,990 --> 01:42:05,990
by them on the street,
you wouldn't think that I bet that 

2314
01:42:05,990 --> 01:42:05,990
person would like me

2315
01:42:05,990 --> 01:42:06,420
really.
And then,

2316
01:42:06,530 --> 01:42:07,030
yeah,
I mean,

2317
01:42:07,031 --> 01:42:08,290
I don't know.
I don't assume,

2318
01:42:08,291 --> 01:42:13,291
I assume that no one likes me.
So when people are there and eventually 

2319
01:42:13,291 --> 01:42:15,880
I'm going to be right.
And when people are at the show,

2320
01:42:15,881 --> 01:42:17,650
I just go.
If I saw them in public,

2321
01:42:17,651 --> 01:42:18,730
I wouldn't think,
oh,

2322
01:42:18,731 --> 01:42:23,731
that guy's,
that guy's coming to the new and 

2323
01:42:23,731 --> 01:42:23,731
children.
How many tour,

2324
01:42:23,731 --> 01:42:27,480
how many shows have you perform now?
How many months you've been doing the 

2325
01:42:27,480 --> 01:42:27,480
like the hour?

2326
01:42:27,510 --> 01:42:28,920
Uh,
I just did a,

2327
01:42:29,130 --> 01:42:30,990
I did it for a couple of weeks and now 
I'm back.

2328
01:42:30,991 --> 01:42:33,600
And then I'm now I'm doing like club 
dates fairly regularly.

2329
01:42:33,890 --> 01:42:36,860
So are you enjoying this?
I love it.

2330
01:42:36,861 --> 01:42:37,460
It's great.
I'm

2331
01:42:37,500 --> 01:42:40,010
saying it's like I just liked the idea 
of,

2332
01:42:40,130 --> 01:42:41,340
of,
of uh,

2333
01:42:41,440 --> 01:42:42,080
uh,
you know,

2334
01:42:42,081 --> 01:42:43,220
what's funny is,
and you'll,

2335
01:42:43,250 --> 01:42:48,250
you may relate to,
I would assume that I'm way behind you 

2336
01:42:48,250 --> 01:42:51,121
in terms of development standup wise,
where your feeling about the audience 

2337
01:42:51,740 --> 01:42:53,720
changes.
The more you do stand up.

2338
01:42:54,440 --> 01:42:56,870
I feel like the first thing you have to 
do is just to overcome nerves,

2339
01:42:57,260 --> 01:42:59,390
which takes.
It took me years.

2340
01:42:59,450 --> 01:43:04,450
I mean,
I think it takes everyone using just 

2341
01:43:04,450 --> 01:43:04,450
reps,
reps,

2342
01:43:04,450 --> 01:43:04,450
reps,
reps,

2343
01:43:04,450 --> 01:43:04,450
right?
yeah.

2344
01:43:04,450 --> 01:43:05,010
Just get onstage gonna just get you as 
kevin wants to.

2345
01:43:05,011 --> 01:43:07,160
My brother once said,
you know,

2346
01:43:07,161 --> 01:43:12,161
you're doing a lot of standup when 
you're comfortable onstage and 

2347
01:43:12,161 --> 01:43:13,730
uncomfortable at the grocery store,
which is fucking true.

2348
01:43:13,731 --> 01:43:18,731
Where you just do.
The thing about the road is you do so 

2349
01:43:18,731 --> 01:43:19,010
much standup that you dislike when 
you're not doing it.

2350
01:43:19,011 --> 01:43:20,300
You're a little bit like,
oh,

2351
01:43:20,301 --> 01:43:21,280
what am I?
Oh yeah,

2352
01:43:21,281 --> 01:43:22,640
no,
it should be doing standup.

2353
01:43:23,570 --> 01:43:28,570
So I finally got like not nervous and 
from tHat your audience,

2354
01:43:31,010 --> 01:43:33,680
I'm no longer defensive against the 
audience.

2355
01:43:33,681 --> 01:43:37,640
I know no longer see the audiences is 
thing I'm keeping at bay,

2356
01:43:37,970 --> 01:43:40,970
you know what I mean?
I no longer seat is like elian that I've

2357
01:43:40,971 --> 01:43:43,370
got a whip and a chair and I'm like 
keeping them back.

2358
01:43:43,790 --> 01:43:48,790
Now I see it more like I'm immersed like
a diane fossey pit.

2359
01:43:51,150 --> 01:43:51,910
Like I'm,
I'm,

2360
01:43:51,930 --> 01:43:52,080
I'm,

2361
01:43:52,280 --> 01:43:56,270
I'm like in the middle of the crowd and 
I feel like they won't overwhelm

2362
01:43:56,350 --> 01:44:01,350
that feeling,
that you need to overwhelm them and 

2363
01:44:01,350 --> 01:44:03,661
control them and whipped them as 
basically the same feeling that 

2364
01:44:03,661 --> 01:44:05,740
unattractive men have towards women when
they're unsuccessful.

2365
01:44:05,910 --> 01:44:06,450
Yeah.
You know,

2366
01:44:06,490 --> 01:44:11,490
that anger that may have towards women,
a lot of comedians have that angle 

2367
01:44:11,490 --> 01:44:11,860
audience.
Absolutely.

2368
01:44:11,910 --> 01:44:13,830
Because of the constant rejection.
Yes.

2369
01:44:13,831 --> 01:44:18,831
Or just say almost like fuck fucking 
people fucking just fucking people and 

2370
01:44:18,831 --> 01:44:18,831
you know,
and it's.

2371
01:44:18,831 --> 01:44:19,030
And the audience can smell it on you.
Yeah.

2372
01:44:19,031 --> 01:44:20,050
Immediately,
of course.

2373
01:44:20,051 --> 01:44:21,100
And so can women,
you know,

2374
01:44:21,101 --> 01:44:23,260
a guy coming to buy a drink.
No fucking lesbian.

2375
01:44:23,440 --> 01:44:25,390
You know,
tony Montana,

2376
01:44:25,420 --> 01:44:28,540
when a guys just ready to snap over to 
the other side,

2377
01:44:28,870 --> 01:44:29,980
it's always the same thing.
Well that's.

2378
01:44:30,150 --> 01:44:32,910
And that's the difference.
It's like some girl said like,

2379
01:44:33,090 --> 01:44:37,830
you're so smooth or something with like 
just nice talking to a guy who knows how

2380
01:44:37,831 --> 01:44:42,831
to talk to a girl and it's like you.
because you have to stop looking at it 

2381
01:44:42,831 --> 01:44:46,310
as a buyer,
as a seller and you have to look at it 

2382
01:44:46,310 --> 01:44:49,731
as a buyer.
That's in some ways I've stopped being 

2383
01:44:49,731 --> 01:44:49,731
like that.

2384
01:44:49,731 --> 01:44:50,930
Ah,
right.

2385
01:44:52,150 --> 01:44:53,140
Am I.
What do you think,

2386
01:44:53,141 --> 01:44:53,850
babe?
Huh?

2387
01:44:54,410 --> 01:44:55,300
I used to do,
yeah,

2388
01:44:55,530 --> 01:44:58,650
a lot of dance and those guys

2389
01:45:01,500 --> 01:45:05,580
dot that they eat and eat and now it's 
more like,

2390
01:45:05,610 --> 01:45:06,850
what do you.
I,

2391
01:45:07,050 --> 01:45:12,050
it's the chris rock thing of 90 percent 
of girls want to fuck 10 percent of the 

2392
01:45:12,050 --> 01:45:12,210
guys.
Once you get into that 10 percent,

2393
01:45:12,211 --> 01:45:14,700
you are officially a buyer.
Like your 10 percent.

2394
01:45:14,970 --> 01:45:19,970
You're in the top 10.
What leaped you into that top 10 

2395
01:45:19,970 --> 01:45:20,070
chappelle show?
Next question.

2396
01:45:22,110 --> 01:45:27,110
Show.
And also just the fact that you have a 

2397
01:45:27,110 --> 01:45:30,310
credit credit and an age soon.
Unexperienced meaning a hot girl.

2398
01:45:30,391 --> 01:45:33,630
How soon do you pull out the.
He was the cocreative chappelle show.

2399
01:45:34,940 --> 01:45:39,940
First hour.
You have a couple of january between 10 

2400
01:45:39,940 --> 01:45:41,150
seconds and 40 seconds.
So really if you're,

2401
01:45:41,190 --> 01:45:43,080
if you're at a bar with someone.
So neil,

2402
01:45:43,110 --> 01:45:44,120
what do you do?
Well,

2403
01:45:44,121 --> 01:45:48,300
what I do when I was directing the,
the pivot movie,

2404
01:45:48,301 --> 01:45:49,350
I would,
I would go,

2405
01:45:49,351 --> 01:45:50,550
uh,
I would go,

2406
01:45:50,570 --> 01:45:52,710
you're,
you're going to think I'm a douche bag,

2407
01:45:53,160 --> 01:45:54,180
but I,
I,

2408
01:45:54,181 --> 01:45:55,260
uh,
I,

2409
01:45:55,560 --> 01:45:58,280
I'm a movie director and they've got 
like what,

2410
01:45:58,281 --> 01:46:03,281
what do you.
And then you just get like it is one of 

2411
01:46:03,281 --> 01:46:03,720
those weird ass jobs where it's like,
so,

2412
01:46:03,780 --> 01:46:06,570
so use by saying it,
it just sounds so cliche.

2413
01:46:06,600 --> 01:46:08,010
Yeah.
It in la,

2414
01:46:08,011 --> 01:46:09,420
especially if you're like,
what do I do?

2415
01:46:09,421 --> 01:46:11,760
I'm a director,
but when you're actually working,

2416
01:46:11,790 --> 01:46:14,400
when you actually have a job.
So I don't,

2417
01:46:14,401 --> 01:46:18,810
but so right now,
so right now I say I'm a comedian,

2418
01:46:18,811 --> 01:46:21,320
I'm in comedy.
And then just leave it like that.

2419
01:46:21,500 --> 01:46:22,540
Yeah.
But you

2420
01:46:22,540 --> 01:46:27,540
got this ace in your sleeve that you 
want to pull out and want to pull out 

2421
01:46:27,540 --> 01:46:27,550
that chappelle show.
How it,

2422
01:46:28,630 --> 01:46:31,000
how long do you wait?
It really all depends.

2423
01:46:31,001 --> 01:46:33,540
Like if it's going well,
you don't even pull it out for a while.

2424
01:46:33,550 --> 01:46:34,840
It's going well.
Yeah.

2425
01:46:34,841 --> 01:46:35,650
No,
I sit on it.

2426
01:46:35,830 --> 01:46:37,750
Yeah,
I get it.

2427
01:46:37,751 --> 01:46:41,140
The old fashion way back again with the,
with my own hands.

2428
01:46:41,141 --> 01:46:43,270
I don't get enough credits,
you get it just by being a community,

2429
01:46:43,271 --> 01:46:48,160
but if she gets a little slippery was on
a buddy of mine.

2430
01:46:48,630 --> 01:46:49,860
Oh,
don't do it that way.

2431
01:46:49,861 --> 01:46:50,170
Dia

2432
01:46:50,500 --> 01:46:53,590
a tropic casually at the olive garden or
so.

2433
01:46:53,591 --> 01:46:55,520
No,
you can't say I created the bullshit.

2434
01:46:55,530 --> 01:46:57,920
You just lose.
You mentioned garden every episode,

2435
01:46:57,921 --> 01:46:59,550
right?
Because it's the most generic restaurant

2436
01:46:59,551 --> 01:47:00,780
I can think of that.
But you always mentioned.

2437
01:47:00,781 --> 01:47:04,020
I'll start saying chili's.
You can't just say,

2438
01:47:04,380 --> 01:47:06,840
you have to say a buddy of mine.
You can't say like,

2439
01:47:07,110 --> 01:47:09,390
you know,
when I was directing,

2440
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:11,820
you can't,
you can't name it,

2441
01:47:11,821 --> 01:47:13,360
you have to go up.
but buddy mine,

2442
01:47:13,370 --> 01:47:16,680
I was,
I worked on the show and did a chappelle

2443
01:47:16,681 --> 01:47:21,681
show.
My favorite is when I go to open mics 

2444
01:47:21,681 --> 01:47:22,110
that people don't know me and they go,
what do you want me to say?

2445
01:47:22,650 --> 01:47:23,740
And I go,
uh,

2446
01:47:24,190 --> 01:47:25,350
particularly,
it used to happen a lot.

2447
01:47:25,351 --> 01:47:27,720
I go and cook inch belsher and they go,
what?

2448
01:47:29,370 --> 01:47:32,060
That would be good to go.
Okay.

2449
01:47:32,700 --> 01:47:34,950
And then they would go because they,
it's like a,

2450
01:47:35,210 --> 01:47:38,820
I used to call it the atomic credit 
because it is one of the things like,

2451
01:47:38,850 --> 01:47:41,490
whoa,
take put that thing away.

2452
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:42,860
Like,
how about a fucking.

2453
01:47:43,150 --> 01:47:46,260
You were on fallon or something new.
Did you feel like that that was a lot of

2454
01:47:46,261 --> 01:47:48,550
responsibility to live up to when you 
first started doing stem?

2455
01:47:48,560 --> 01:47:48,870
Well,
yeah,

2456
01:47:48,871 --> 01:47:53,871
that's what [inaudible] my brother was.
My brother kevin was slamming me that 

2457
01:47:53,871 --> 01:47:53,871
saying that like,
you know,

2458
01:47:53,871 --> 01:47:56,100
you're getting opportunities you don't 
deserve and all that stuff.

2459
01:47:56,101 --> 01:47:57,970
And he said,
oh yeah,

2460
01:47:58,050 --> 01:48:03,050
I'm not a real comedian.
And sloW your own brother said that to 

2461
01:48:03,050 --> 01:48:03,090
you.
What the fuck is that about?

2462
01:48:03,420 --> 01:48:07,680
It's about a growing up one of 10 and 
elbowing each other and wow.

2463
01:48:07,690 --> 01:48:12,690
Petition of 10.
Why do you think I'm focused on 

2464
01:48:12,690 --> 01:48:12,690
compensation?
I got brothers that don't talk to me,

2465
01:48:12,690 --> 01:48:12,690
you know,
it's like wow.

2466
01:48:13,100 --> 01:48:15,690
And if I blamed capitalist,
uh,

2467
01:48:16,900 --> 01:48:18,250
kind,
uh,

2468
01:48:18,630 --> 01:48:23,630
yeah,
it's amazing that you have all these 

2469
01:48:23,630 --> 01:48:23,630
hippie ideals,
dad on smoking with us.

2470
01:48:23,630 --> 01:48:23,630
Uh,
yeah.

2471
01:48:23,630 --> 01:48:25,590
So.
And then we all competed with six guys.

2472
01:48:25,990 --> 01:48:28,500
There were five brothers,
so,

2473
01:48:28,501 --> 01:48:29,400
uh,
but yeah,

2474
01:48:29,401 --> 01:48:33,870
it wasn't bombing as the creator 
chappelle show was worse than bombing as

2475
01:48:33,871 --> 01:48:37,590
an anonymous guy.
I've got to think a pressure on you.

2476
01:48:37,591 --> 01:48:38,500
That's what I'm asking.
No.

2477
01:48:38,520 --> 01:48:39,750
Yeah,
there was absolutely pressure.

2478
01:48:39,810 --> 01:48:41,970
I mean,
I wasn't like conscious of it,

2479
01:48:42,390 --> 01:48:45,960
but looking back it was,
it was definitely pressure,

2480
01:48:46,200 --> 01:48:51,200
but that's.
So that's what's nice to be in a place 

2481
01:48:51,200 --> 01:48:51,630
where it's just more like,
I just,

2482
01:48:51,631 --> 01:48:53,430
the is like,
they just have,

2483
01:48:53,850 --> 01:48:58,850
it's like the robin landing on your 
shoulder and fucking I'm now I'm a 

2484
01:48:58,850 --> 01:49:00,830
chimney sweep from mary poppins.
That's who you are.

2485
01:49:00,900 --> 01:49:02,730
That's who I am to the audience.
So,

2486
01:49:02,750 --> 01:49:04,500
um,
you've done,

2487
01:49:04,530 --> 01:49:09,530
you've started doing your own podcast.
Have you noticed immediately and impact 

2488
01:49:09,530 --> 01:49:10,330
and like they podcast fans are coming to
you?

2489
01:49:10,650 --> 01:49:12,510
Not Immediately because we've only done 
two.

2490
01:49:12,720 --> 01:49:16,080
Our third one will go up this up now I 
think called the champs.

2491
01:49:16,590 --> 01:49:18,840
Uh,
and they,

2492
01:49:18,930 --> 01:49:19,650
the,
yeah,

2493
01:49:19,651 --> 01:49:20,630
it hasn't happened yet,
but,

2494
01:49:20,670 --> 01:49:25,290
but I believe it will like it because I 
see just look if if 10,000

2495
01:49:25,291 --> 01:49:30,291
people listen to it then that's 10,000
people that I either sort of knew me or 

2496
01:49:31,081 --> 01:49:32,340
didn't know me or,
or,

2497
01:49:32,600 --> 01:49:37,050
or knew me and will now feel more 
connected because I think that's the new

2498
01:49:37,051 --> 01:49:41,790
paradigm is the just feeding people,
just constant feeding.

2499
01:49:41,940 --> 01:49:44,490
Like here you go baby,
are you still hungry baby babies,

2500
01:49:44,491 --> 01:49:46,370
the audience in this metaphor,
like you're just.

2501
01:49:46,430 --> 01:49:49,990
And particularly you give them free 
stuff and that eventually go,

2502
01:49:49,991 --> 01:49:50,650
hey,
just so you know,

2503
01:49:50,651 --> 01:49:53,260
I got to charge every once in a while.
So you know,

2504
01:49:53,261 --> 01:49:56,350
listen to this ad or it's like the 
little wayne paradigm.

2505
01:49:56,351 --> 01:50:01,351
Little wayne put out four records that 
he just mixed tapes and the and they're 

2506
01:50:01,541 --> 01:50:03,520
good and they're really good songs.

2507
01:50:03,700 --> 01:50:08,700
And he just released him on the.
And then when he came up with his 

2508
01:50:08,700 --> 01:50:09,700
record,
the carter it people bought it.

2509
01:50:09,840 --> 01:50:14,840
He was,
he's the last guy to sell a million 

2510
01:50:14,840 --> 01:50:14,840
records in a week because I think people
were like,

2511
01:50:14,840 --> 01:50:19,260
I don't think if people implicitly knew 
that that's what they're explicitly 

2512
01:50:19,260 --> 01:50:19,570
knew,
that that's what they were doing,

2513
01:50:19,571 --> 01:50:21,430
but I believe that people were like,
you know what,

2514
01:50:21,431 --> 01:50:23,950
I've gotten so many of these guys songs 
for free.

2515
01:50:24,310 --> 01:50:26,680
LeT me pay for a couple of them.
I mean,

2516
01:50:26,681 --> 01:50:31,681
I don't know.
I mean I definitely felt like that was 

2517
01:50:31,681 --> 01:50:32,740
my point of view on it and I think that 
that's the new with this democratization

2518
01:50:32,741 --> 01:50:33,640
is like,
yeah,

2519
01:50:33,660 --> 01:50:38,660
it's free like it is.
The startup cost for thIs aren't 

2520
01:50:38,660 --> 01:50:39,580
massive,
but there there's something and then you

2521
01:50:39,581 --> 01:50:43,240
give it to people and you're,
you're exchanging ideas and,

2522
01:50:43,330 --> 01:50:47,560
and,
and human energy for their time and then

2523
01:50:47,561 --> 01:50:48,910
hopefully they develop a connection with
you.

2524
01:50:49,380 --> 01:50:52,440
You know what I noticed?
It's very sterile way of looking at it,

2525
01:50:52,500 --> 01:50:54,120
but it's not,
but it's a human.

2526
01:50:54,180 --> 01:50:54,870
Here's what I've noticed.

2527
01:50:54,950 --> 01:50:59,750
I've noticed when I was on your podcast,
a lot of people came and were like,

2528
01:50:59,751 --> 01:51:04,751
hey man,
I heard you and I didn't know who you 

2529
01:51:04,751 --> 01:51:06,221
were.
I didn't know what you were about and 

2530
01:51:06,221 --> 01:51:06,221
then because of this,
so I,

2531
01:51:06,221 --> 01:51:07,100
I,
so yes,

2532
01:51:07,101 --> 01:51:08,540
to answer your question,
people have come up,

2533
01:51:08,541 --> 01:51:09,830
but not because of my podcast,

2534
01:51:10,070 --> 01:51:15,070
because of your podcast.
I think what you're saying makes a lot 

2535
01:51:15,070 --> 01:51:18,971
of sense,
but it makes it seem like you're 

2536
01:51:18,971 --> 01:51:19,600
analyzing it like the stock market,
that connection.

2537
01:51:19,640 --> 01:51:21,770
I'm only analyzing it in retrospect

2538
01:51:21,810 --> 01:51:23,580
cause I didn't because I was,
I,

2539
01:51:23,770 --> 01:51:28,770
I do twitter because I've always liked 
talking and little aphorisms like that 

2540
01:51:28,770 --> 01:51:29,410
and then I was like,
oh.

2541
01:51:29,440 --> 01:51:30,670
Then I realized like,
oh,

2542
01:51:30,671 --> 01:51:35,671
I get what this is.
I get this model and I've only gotten 

2543
01:51:35,671 --> 01:51:38,641
him really since.
DoIng your podcast is like where you 

2544
01:51:38,641 --> 01:51:39,550
said you've never had a connection like 
this with the audience.

2545
01:51:40,030 --> 01:51:43,780
It's a connection and to get rid of a 
gatekeeper to get rid of a studio,

2546
01:51:43,781 --> 01:51:45,160
to get rid of a television network.

2547
01:51:45,300 --> 01:51:47,130
Yeah.
Is excellent.

2548
01:51:47,640 --> 01:51:50,310
It's amazing to be able to do something 
like this.

2549
01:51:50,520 --> 01:51:55,520
Look,
this podcast has changed everything as 

2550
01:51:55,520 --> 01:51:57,981
far as me doing comedy clubs.
Now I do very little publicity outside 

2551
01:51:57,981 --> 01:52:02,571
of just talking about it on the comedy 
club or just talking about it rather on 

2552
01:52:02,571 --> 01:52:04,160
the podcast and you know,
everything has changed.

2553
01:52:04,470 --> 01:52:06,690
The numbers of people that come out to 
see me has changed.

2554
01:52:06,691 --> 01:52:11,691
The ease of doing it.
I no longer have to fly in a day early 

2555
01:52:11,691 --> 01:52:13,110
and do running radio things.
It's way easier now.

2556
01:52:13,160 --> 01:52:14,030
Yeah,
and that's.

2557
01:52:14,320 --> 01:52:18,240
And that's just from basically giving 
something for free,

2558
01:52:18,260 --> 01:52:18,800
but you,
you're,

2559
01:52:18,801 --> 01:52:23,801
you're friends with these people,
you don't even know them and you're 

2560
01:52:23,801 --> 01:52:25,941
friends with them and they start 
thinking like you guys think and going 

2561
01:52:25,941 --> 01:52:29,571
over the thing,
the ideas that get discussed on the 

2562
01:52:29,571 --> 01:52:29,571
podcast and talk about amongst their 
friends and all these good ideas.

2563
01:52:29,571 --> 01:52:30,620
Blossom and grow.
Yeah,

2564
01:52:31,260 --> 01:52:33,220
that's the,
that's the thing of it.

2565
01:52:33,221 --> 01:52:36,630
You do give it for free and it's.
But it's not.

2566
01:52:36,631 --> 01:52:38,100
It is.
It's about the connection.

2567
01:52:38,101 --> 01:52:39,450
It's just like I,
like I said,

2568
01:52:39,451 --> 01:52:40,800
I like talking.
I like,

2569
01:52:40,830 --> 01:52:43,260
I like people.
I think I've got interesting,

2570
01:52:43,261 --> 01:52:46,220
well thought out ideas that I can in a 
relatively

2571
01:52:46,220 --> 01:52:47,210
funny way.
So it's like,

2572
01:52:47,450 --> 01:52:52,450
yeah,
I think people could benefit from 

2573
01:52:52,450 --> 01:52:54,530
hearing me speak.
People will enjoy it for sure.

2574
01:52:54,650 --> 01:52:55,180
Yeah.
No,

2575
01:52:55,181 --> 01:52:56,150
they've been,
like I said,

2576
01:52:56,151 --> 01:52:58,250
people really enjoyed the last one.
I was here last time.

2577
01:52:58,290 --> 01:53:02,000
You need some marijuana in your life,
kid brand,

2578
01:53:02,680 --> 01:53:07,680
definitely.
Abby did the thing about you being 

2579
01:53:07,680 --> 01:53:07,680
really tired and stuff?
I,

2580
01:53:07,680 --> 01:53:07,680
I really,
uh,

2581
01:53:07,800 --> 01:53:12,800
I,
I have that too where I'm just a zero 

2582
01:53:12,800 --> 01:53:15,401
energy.
I'm super tired most of the time I'm 

2583
01:53:15,401 --> 01:53:15,980
either depressed or sad or like,
you know,

2584
01:53:15,981 --> 01:53:17,610
and uh,
but,

2585
01:53:17,810 --> 01:53:19,330
but lately I've been like,
you know,

2586
01:53:19,370 --> 01:53:21,330
having a good time in my personal life 
that,

2587
01:53:21,360 --> 01:53:23,660
that all magically just disappeared.
Like went away.

2588
01:53:23,661 --> 01:53:26,600
I've never done any kind of zoned off.
I've never done kind of any prescription

2589
01:53:26,700 --> 01:53:28,280
management.
I've always been the type of person that

2590
01:53:28,281 --> 01:53:30,940
needs it.
But if there's anything that I would say

2591
01:53:30,960 --> 01:53:35,960
would help me get through everything,
marijuana definitely has just helped me 

2592
01:53:35,960 --> 01:53:40,120
tremendously.
It has a built in self promotion 

2593
01:53:40,120 --> 01:53:42,971
mechanism.
There is not a drug in the world that 

2594
01:53:42,971 --> 01:53:46,211
when you do it,
people that you talk about more drug in 

2595
01:53:46,211 --> 01:53:46,450
the world is more beneficial in the 
daily business.

2596
01:53:46,630 --> 01:53:51,630
Exactly what people have tylenol and 
they talk about topics like a mild 

2597
01:53:51,630 --> 01:53:51,630
psychedelic.

2598
01:53:51,630 --> 01:53:52,390
It's like a psychedelic digging use all 
the time.

2599
01:53:52,450 --> 01:53:54,610
You can't do mushrooms every day.
I mean you can,

2600
01:53:55,030 --> 01:53:57,280
but you're going to fucking lose your 
connection to humanity.

2601
01:53:57,830 --> 01:54:00,700
You could smoke pot everyday and it just
makes you more empathetic.

2602
01:54:00,760 --> 01:54:02,440
It makes you more,
more real,

2603
01:54:02,480 --> 01:54:06,040
makes you connect,
connect to your real emotions better.

2604
01:54:06,070 --> 01:54:07,630
The way you interact wIth people

2605
01:54:07,890 --> 01:54:12,890
takes away headaches.
If I'd like to be as sharp as possible,

2606
01:54:13,200 --> 01:54:15,960
I like my brain to function well.
It doesn't fuck with your function.

2607
01:54:15,961 --> 01:54:18,640
The brain it has in the past and getting
the wrong leads on.

2608
01:54:18,660 --> 01:54:22,370
There's two different rap weed.
I know you had chocolate fever.

2609
01:54:22,371 --> 01:54:24,210
So you smoke weed,
you're smoking the.

2610
01:54:24,211 --> 01:54:25,260
I go into a coma.

2611
01:54:25,560 --> 01:54:27,830
[inaudible] just gonna sit here and 
chill.

2612
01:54:28,190 --> 01:54:29,410
I would,
uh,

2613
01:54:30,310 --> 01:54:35,310
you got scared.
We try to offer it to you before the 

2614
01:54:35,310 --> 01:54:35,310
show.
I thought about a scam.

2615
01:54:35,310 --> 01:54:35,450
You got nervous?
I ruined my pants.

2616
01:54:35,510 --> 01:54:36,330
I could see it,
man.

2617
01:54:36,600 --> 01:54:37,400
Uh,
no.

2618
01:54:37,401 --> 01:54:38,420
I just don't.
You mock it.

2619
01:54:38,630 --> 01:54:43,630
It's like when a fighter gets hit and 
they shake their head like that was 

2620
01:54:43,630 --> 01:54:45,671
nothing.
Usually it was usually it will show he 

2621
01:54:45,671 --> 01:54:47,170
got rocked.
How about when someone gets to the point

2622
01:54:47,320 --> 01:54:52,320
they didn't do guilty or not guilty?
Don't be plead.

2623
01:54:53,161 --> 01:54:54,320
Not guilty.
Don't be doing.

2624
01:54:54,321 --> 01:54:59,321
Not around here.
I'm not saying marijuana is for 

2625
01:54:59,321 --> 01:55:01,511
everybody,
but it is for you and help you 

2626
01:55:01,511 --> 01:55:01,511
tremendously.
You can,

2627
01:55:01,511 --> 01:55:03,880
if you can get me some,
a vaporizer or something.

2628
01:55:04,530 --> 01:55:05,630
Yeah.
That could be.

2629
01:55:05,860 --> 01:55:09,080
Can be smokIng because then it'll start 
smoking cigarettes and really thinks no.

2630
01:55:09,740 --> 01:55:10,730
How long has it been?
Ten years.

2631
01:55:11,720 --> 01:55:14,950
IT's been like 13 years ago.
Already.

2632
01:55:15,020 --> 01:55:17,080
Dirty,
stinky fucking disease.

2633
01:55:17,870 --> 01:55:19,040
Isn't it weird?
He still went.

2634
01:55:19,060 --> 01:55:21,470
Oh yeah.
I had dreams where I smoke and I wake up

2635
01:55:21,471 --> 01:55:24,950
like at lIke in my dream I'm like,
the fuck are you doing smoking meth?

2636
01:55:25,370 --> 01:55:27,770
And then I wake up and I'm like,
thank god I had a friend,

2637
01:55:28,140 --> 01:55:31,520
the friend the other day at work,
some bad news happen,

2638
01:55:31,521 --> 01:55:36,521
and all sudden he goes,
I haven't smoked a cigarette and six 

2639
01:55:36,521 --> 01:55:36,650
years and he lights up a cigarette.
I go put that fucking thing down.

2640
01:55:37,100 --> 01:55:38,820
I go throw that thing on the ground,
step on him.

2641
01:55:38,821 --> 01:55:39,380
And he goes,
yeah,

2642
01:55:39,381 --> 01:55:41,090
I go,
fuck that.

2643
01:55:41,091 --> 01:55:43,920
You're not going to do.
you're going to give in now for this.

2644
01:55:43,950 --> 01:55:44,190
Don't

2645
01:55:44,190 --> 01:55:45,000
do it.
Don't do it.

2646
01:55:45,001 --> 01:55:46,520
So he stomped on it and he was already 
like,

2647
01:55:46,530 --> 01:55:48,720
thank you very much.
I to a fucking started smoking again.

2648
01:55:48,750 --> 01:55:50,370
Three hours later he did.
Yeah.

2649
01:55:50,371 --> 01:55:53,550
If I smelled smoke $10,000,
what is that?

2650
01:55:54,230 --> 01:55:57,570
It's the most addictive product on the 
market.

2651
01:55:59,100 --> 01:56:04,100
Apparently though I know a dude who did 
heroin who says that you can go fuck 

2652
01:56:04,100 --> 01:56:07,401
yourself.
And everybody that says that it's tough 

2653
01:56:07,401 --> 01:56:07,401
to quit cigarettes.
He goes,

2654
01:56:07,401 --> 01:56:07,401
heroin is way harder to quit than 
cigarettes.

2655
01:56:07,401 --> 01:56:09,120
And people always say quitting 
cigarettes is,

2656
01:56:09,121 --> 01:56:11,700
were harder than quitting heroin.
Absolutely untrue.

2657
01:56:11,701 --> 01:56:13,650
He said,
heroin is way harder.

2658
01:56:13,680 --> 01:56:14,820
It is harder.
But.

2659
01:56:14,850 --> 01:56:17,580
But I,
but I believe from person person.

2660
01:56:17,581 --> 01:56:18,510
I'm sure it's.
Well,

2661
01:56:18,511 --> 01:56:21,180
I didn't,
I didn't find quitting that hard.

2662
01:56:21,780 --> 01:56:24,630
I just decided.
But you still it still scratching?

2663
01:56:24,810 --> 01:56:26,430
Yeah,
but I still worry about,

2664
01:56:26,670 --> 01:56:29,490
about just getting into doing it again.

2665
01:56:29,690 --> 01:56:32,800
Is there any greater evidence that this,
the,

2666
01:56:32,820 --> 01:56:35,480
the politicians are bought and paid for 
then tobacco?

2667
01:56:35,990 --> 01:56:37,100
Oh no.
Well that's what I mean.

2668
01:56:37,101 --> 01:56:40,810
It's like with the fact that they knew 
it was unhealthy and fifties and sixties

2669
01:56:40,850 --> 01:56:44,840
and it took 40 more years.
My doctor recommends chesterfield.

2670
01:56:45,170 --> 01:56:47,900
absolutely took them 40 years to get it.

2671
01:56:48,290 --> 01:56:49,930
Only to the point where it's like,
alright,

2672
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:55,000
you can sell them,
but we're going to tack them at such a 

2673
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:55,000
high rate.
It's going to.

2674
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:56,050
We're gonna tax them at a cartoonishly 
irate.

2675
01:56:56,190 --> 01:57:00,670
It's amazing too that some people have 
actually sued for damage.

2676
01:57:00,930 --> 01:57:05,930
You know,
they've sued the tobacco companies in 

2677
01:57:05,930 --> 01:57:05,930
one.
You know,

2678
01:57:05,930 --> 01:57:05,930
there's been some big handouts,
man,

2679
01:57:05,930 --> 01:57:07,920
so people have to figure out who gets 
paid,

2680
01:57:07,921 --> 01:57:09,030
who doesn't,
how can they,

2681
01:57:09,060 --> 01:57:14,060
how many suits can they allow?
How many lawsuits really can be 

2682
01:57:14,060 --> 01:57:17,121
processed against tobacco companies.
There's a fucking half a million people 

2683
01:57:17,121 --> 01:57:19,070
every year dying.
5 million worldwide,

2684
01:57:19,110 --> 01:57:22,040
died prematurely directly as it was,
you know,

2685
01:57:22,420 --> 01:57:27,420
well,
I'm less interested in that and more 

2686
01:57:27,420 --> 01:57:29,281
interested in obesity in terms of in 
terms of the next terms of draining 

2687
01:57:30,101 --> 01:57:31,810
society,
because that's where you go,

2688
01:57:31,960 --> 01:57:35,650
hey,
you can't legislate people's diets.

2689
01:57:35,990 --> 01:57:36,550
It's like,
okay,

2690
01:57:36,551 --> 01:57:40,000
but it's a.
It's basically a seatbelt laws iF,

2691
01:57:40,030 --> 01:57:41,200
if,
if,

2692
01:57:41,260 --> 01:57:46,260
if,
if you're going to eat yourself into 

2693
01:57:46,260 --> 01:57:47,080
obesity and then you're going to drain 
the healthcare system,

2694
01:57:47,081 --> 01:57:48,130
you're gonna drive up.
MY,

2695
01:57:48,190 --> 01:57:49,960
my,
the cost of my healthcare,

2696
01:57:50,200 --> 01:57:55,200
the cost of the government.
I mean that was a lot of the stuff with 

2697
01:57:55,200 --> 01:57:58,410
the tobacco industry.
They had to pay states because states 

2698
01:57:58,410 --> 01:58:01,021
were fucking paying so much money to 
treat people with lung cancer that you 

2699
01:58:01,021 --> 01:58:01,420
kind of go,
okay,

2700
01:58:01,421 --> 01:58:03,610
well then what?
That's got to be next.

2701
01:58:03,970 --> 01:58:08,970
That's got to be.
You've got an outlaw or tax cocacola or 

2702
01:58:08,970 --> 01:58:10,180
tax frito lay in it.

2703
01:58:10,770 --> 01:58:15,770
Why is that?
Because it's the only people that abuse 

2704
01:58:15,770 --> 01:58:18,071
it.
I would say that's way more ridiculous 

2705
01:58:18,071 --> 01:58:18,290
than taxing tobacco because look,
the other day I was in a supermarket and

2706
01:58:18,291 --> 01:58:23,291
for a goof I picked up a box of lucky 
charms and I took them home and I had a 

2707
01:58:23,291 --> 01:58:23,690
bowl of lucky charms.
Yeah,

2708
01:58:23,691 --> 01:58:25,100
it was yummy,
but you know what?

2709
01:58:25,101 --> 01:58:26,630
I eat healthy.
I eat healthy,

2710
01:58:26,631 --> 01:58:31,631
but I.
I reserve my own personal right to eat 

2711
01:58:31,631 --> 01:58:35,711
something shitty every now and then.
It doesn't mean that shitty food should 

2712
01:58:35,711 --> 01:58:38,690
be illegal because you're too stupid.
Incorrect because physical,

2713
01:58:38,691 --> 01:58:42,640
the physical addiction of cigarettes is 
far more pulling.

2714
01:58:42,940 --> 01:58:45,120
Then the addiction to sugar.
Sugar is like,

2715
01:58:45,450 --> 01:58:47,650
that's a psychological addiction more 
than anything.

2716
01:58:47,680 --> 01:58:49,900
Right,
but you do admit that conviction.

2717
01:58:49,901 --> 01:58:53,170
Do you notice in your personal alignment
when she'll turn your email?

2718
01:58:53,171 --> 01:58:53,860
It can be an addiction.

2719
01:58:53,890 --> 01:58:56,170
You know,
I believe that's an addiction.

2720
01:58:56,260 --> 01:58:58,900
I believe I am an addict.
I believe on the computer addict.

2721
01:58:58,930 --> 01:59:03,930
Yeah,
and I want someone to tax seen people 

2722
01:59:03,930 --> 01:59:06,481
that cAn't stop texting.
The kids stop texting him out of where 

2723
01:59:06,481 --> 01:59:06,481
they are.
There.

2724
01:59:06,481 --> 01:59:09,170
There was,
I heard a story the other day that a 

2725
01:59:09,170 --> 01:59:10,360
couple in Korea they met online in some,
you know,

2726
01:59:10,390 --> 01:59:14,380
world war craft kind of thing.
They met in person,

2727
01:59:14,740 --> 01:59:18,370
had a baby and then just kept going to 
these,

2728
01:59:18,860 --> 01:59:21,900
these cafes and uh,
they had,

2729
01:59:21,910 --> 01:59:23,470
uh,
in their online world,

2730
01:59:23,471 --> 01:59:28,471
they had a child together and they came 
home one night and the baby had died 

2731
01:59:28,471 --> 01:59:33,031
from their real baby had died from 
starvation because they were so hooked 

2732
01:59:33,031 --> 01:59:36,970
on the internet that they're idiots.
That doesn't mean the internet,

2733
01:59:36,971 --> 01:59:38,890
you know,
I don't think it should be illegal,

2734
01:59:38,891 --> 01:59:42,040
but I'm saying there's no,
you're not saying the difference between

2735
01:59:42,041 --> 01:59:42,300
shoe.

2736
01:59:42,340 --> 01:59:43,000
You can just go,
well,

2737
01:59:43,001 --> 01:59:46,170
sugar is a way more.
People are obese that are,

2738
01:59:46,190 --> 01:59:48,430
that are nice,
but I like snickers bars.

2739
01:59:48,431 --> 01:59:51,490
I liked sneakers.
So you're bright,

2740
01:59:51,520 --> 01:59:54,670
you're just going to get taxed for it.
I'm willing to pay the tax,

2741
01:59:55,060 --> 01:59:57,730
then you're going to pay a much larger 
tax.

2742
01:59:58,640 --> 02:00:02,010
But that doesn't cure anybody.
Let's resolve any of the problems.

2743
02:00:02,050 --> 02:00:04,390
People have quit smoking by 40 percent.
Smoking.

2744
02:00:04,391 --> 02:00:08,140
Smoking is fucking way down from when,
from 20 years ago.

2745
02:00:08,170 --> 02:00:09,880
really 40 percent.
That's pretty high.

2746
02:00:09,920 --> 02:00:11,620
Yeah,
and particularly among teenagers.

2747
02:00:11,680 --> 02:00:12,380
Really.
Yeah,

2748
02:00:12,420 --> 02:00:13,750
as well.
That's a good start.

2749
02:00:13,870 --> 02:00:18,870
Yeah,
that's what I mean like it is when they 

2750
02:00:18,870 --> 02:00:18,870
go.
You can't legislate.

2751
02:00:18,870 --> 02:00:18,940
Yeah,
you can.

2752
02:00:19,300 --> 02:00:21,340
IF you're smart about it.
And,

2753
02:00:21,400 --> 02:00:22,760
and it is,
you know,

2754
02:00:22,870 --> 02:00:25,960
it.
This shit is a drain on society.

2755
02:00:25,990 --> 02:00:27,910
What they should also do the opposite 
too,

2756
02:00:27,940 --> 02:00:30,820
which is a making vegetables and 
healthy.

2757
02:00:33,300 --> 02:00:36,880
TheY would subsidize vegetables with,
uh,

2758
02:00:36,940 --> 02:00:38,730
with,
by taxing snickers.

2759
02:00:38,820 --> 02:00:43,820
You.
So you're in favor of the government 

2760
02:00:43,820 --> 02:00:44,190
getting all lee Willie and people's 
business and taxing things.

2761
02:00:44,360 --> 02:00:46,300
But again,
it's people's business.

2762
02:00:46,301 --> 02:00:48,010
But where's that money go,
man.

2763
02:00:48,011 --> 02:00:50,740
That's when the real problem was 
everybody thinks that taxing things is a

2764
02:00:50,741 --> 02:00:55,741
solution,
but you're going to give that money to 

2765
02:00:55,741 --> 02:00:57,901
an inept government.
This is going to create more fucking 

2766
02:00:57,901 --> 02:00:57,901
jobs and it's not going to go towards 
what you want it to go tour.

2767
02:00:57,901 --> 02:01:02,820
It's going to go towards many,
many jobs being set up for the 

2768
02:01:02,820 --> 02:01:03,650
decimation of the,
the spreading of this money that you've,

2769
02:01:03,690 --> 02:01:06,040
you know,
you brought in taxes.

2770
02:01:06,041 --> 02:01:08,800
Most of the time you raise taxes,
you're gonna raise government.

2771
02:01:08,801 --> 02:01:10,300
The government gets bigger.
There's more jobs,

2772
02:01:10,301 --> 02:01:13,930
more people working in the government,
very few things actually get fixed,

2773
02:01:14,110 --> 02:01:15,040
but there'll be more people.

2774
02:01:15,040 --> 02:01:15,580
Okay,
well,

2775
02:01:15,640 --> 02:01:18,360
or you can everyone can,
uh,

2776
02:01:18,550 --> 02:01:23,550
the,
the alternative in these indicates of 

2777
02:01:23,550 --> 02:01:24,550
cigarettes and it should be illegal to 
kill people.

2778
02:01:24,980 --> 02:01:26,430
Illegal.
I agree with you.

2779
02:01:26,500 --> 02:01:28,330
I mean if you're going to keep anything 
illegal,

2780
02:01:28,360 --> 02:01:30,940
number one should be cigarettes and I 
don't think they should be illegal.

2781
02:01:31,030 --> 02:01:33,400
I think you should be able to smoke 
cigarettes every fucking day.

2782
02:01:33,401 --> 02:01:38,401
Don't get me wrong,
but if you're going to go by the law 

2783
02:01:38,401 --> 02:01:40,860
that the government has the pattern of 
behavior that the government has been 

2784
02:01:40,860 --> 02:01:44,201
pushing since forever,
that they're looking out for the best 

2785
02:01:44,201 --> 02:01:46,661
interests of their citizens.
But tobacco stats are pretty 

2786
02:01:46,661 --> 02:01:46,661
encouraging.
I mean,

2787
02:01:46,661 --> 02:01:51,641
if you say that's a good start,
450 million people or 450,000

2788
02:01:52,611 --> 02:01:55,460
people rather in this country alone,
450,000

2789
02:01:55,550 --> 02:01:58,270
just in this country,
but in 5 million worldwide,

2790
02:01:58,280 --> 02:02:01,670
hundred thousand,
but still an insane number of people.

2791
02:02:01,671 --> 02:02:04,580
That pile of bodies is fucking 
alcoholic.

2792
02:02:04,670 --> 02:02:05,670
Way more than that.
No,

2793
02:02:05,700 --> 02:02:06,070
no,
no,

2794
02:02:06,270 --> 02:02:06,820
no,
no.

2795
02:02:06,830 --> 02:02:08,870
Alcoholism related deaths.
No,

2796
02:02:08,871 --> 02:02:09,170
no,
no,

2797
02:02:09,171 --> 02:02:10,340
no,
it's not as many as cigarettes,

2798
02:02:10,590 --> 02:02:15,590
so it's like 150,000,
but I'm saying you could drink yourself 

2799
02:02:15,590 --> 02:02:20,471
to death slow.
I'm talking about the amount of people 

2800
02:02:20,471 --> 02:02:23,171
that stopped as a partially as a result 
of the higher taxation and just making 

2801
02:02:23,391 --> 02:02:25,120
them prohibitively expensive.
Well,

2802
02:02:25,190 --> 02:02:29,570
that's saying about maxine snickeRs.
even if you.

2803
02:02:29,600 --> 02:02:34,600
It may not be addictive to you,
but clearly it's addictive to a lot of 

2804
02:02:34,851 --> 02:02:39,851
people.
I would say if you want to tax the 

2805
02:02:39,851 --> 02:02:39,851
fucking holy shit out of cigarettes and 
keep selling them,

2806
02:02:39,851 --> 02:02:40,850
I would say good.
That sounds like a good idea,

2807
02:02:40,851 --> 02:02:45,851
but is it possible that the money that 
you take from the taxes would directly 

2808
02:02:45,891 --> 02:02:48,830
go towards something that seems 
worthwhile?

2809
02:02:48,860 --> 02:02:50,210
Will some.
How about the lotterY?

2810
02:02:50,270 --> 02:02:54,210
A lottery goes fucking builds roads.
I mean there's the lottery build roads.

2811
02:02:54,740 --> 02:02:55,970
Yes,
that's what It is.

2812
02:02:55,971 --> 02:03:00,971
I mean there are tons of things.
The lottery in england pays for fucking 

2813
02:03:00,971 --> 02:03:01,810
the bbc.
He's amazing.

2814
02:03:01,900 --> 02:03:03,230
Yeah,
I mean it's such a.

2815
02:03:03,250 --> 02:03:05,780
It's and you want to talk about that 
shit.

2816
02:03:05,810 --> 02:03:07,500
The lottery should be illegal.
Well,

2817
02:03:07,530 --> 02:03:08,420
and sorta.
Yeah,

2818
02:03:08,421 --> 02:03:09,860
but not really.
You can do it.

2819
02:03:09,900 --> 02:03:14,030
We're stupid people.
It should be illegal is shorting things.

2820
02:03:14,180 --> 02:03:17,640
How has that nuttiness of gambling 
illegal in,

2821
02:03:17,650 --> 02:03:20,300
in the stock market,
the nuttiness of gambling,

2822
02:03:20,301 --> 02:03:22,490
like the guy who shorted america's 
credit rating,

2823
02:03:22,730 --> 02:03:26,020
that somehow or another I actually have 
no beef with that guy because if you bet

2824
02:03:27,300 --> 02:03:29,440
on contraction,
yeah,

2825
02:03:29,600 --> 02:03:33,500
but you're betting that's.
Then yoU're betting you're not investing

2826
02:03:33,590 --> 02:03:38,590
in the snob,
but in an investment is gambling.

2827
02:03:39,170 --> 02:03:42,410
You're gambling that this company is 
going to become more sort of,

2828
02:03:42,500 --> 02:03:46,250
but you're supposed to be educated as to
the benefits of this company.

2829
02:03:46,250 --> 02:03:51,250
I mean,
when you write in fucking lockheed 

2830
02:03:51,250 --> 02:03:52,810
martin.
I didn't even know her,

2831
02:03:52,880 --> 02:03:54,250
but I'm saying you,
you,

2832
02:03:54,580 --> 02:03:58,070
you don't thInk of it as gambling.
You think of it as investing.

2833
02:03:58,100 --> 02:04:03,100
I am I absolutely family.
I think the stock people don't have any 

2834
02:04:03,530 --> 02:04:08,530
sense of the term is not that people no 
longer buy things because they believe 

2835
02:04:08,661 --> 02:04:10,960
in the company.
They just look at the metrics and go,

2836
02:04:10,990 --> 02:04:11,690
no,
that's true.

2837
02:04:11,691 --> 02:04:13,010
That's not true.
I know a gUy who,

2838
02:04:13,011 --> 02:04:14,240
uh,
has apple stocK,

2839
02:04:14,241 --> 02:04:19,241
he's a huge apple fan and one of the 
reasons why he's all excited about the 

2840
02:04:19,241 --> 02:04:19,880
apple stock doing so good and she's a 
fucking apple fan.

2841
02:04:19,881 --> 02:04:22,710
He loves It.
I think there's a company mall,

2842
02:04:22,770 --> 02:04:24,440
small percentage.
I don't know,

2843
02:04:24,500 --> 02:04:28,370
I think it might be a small percentage,
but I think some people that invest,

2844
02:04:28,371 --> 02:04:30,890
they do invest with their people that 
invested in,

2845
02:04:30,891 --> 02:04:33,950
for that are all excited at ford's doing
well because it's an american company,

2846
02:04:33,951 --> 02:04:38,951
you know,
they invest with their head and their 

2847
02:04:38,951 --> 02:04:38,951
heart,
but think that that's not

2848
02:04:38,951 --> 02:04:40,110
the average person.
Yeah,

2849
02:04:40,111 --> 02:04:41,470
I think the average per.
I don't.

2850
02:04:41,550 --> 02:04:44,280
I'm a relatively smart guy.
Like I keep saying,

2851
02:04:44,970 --> 02:04:45,750
uh,
and,

2852
02:04:45,810 --> 02:04:46,740
and I,
uh,

2853
02:04:46,741 --> 02:04:51,741
I invested,
I don't know what I got into like a 

2854
02:04:51,741 --> 02:04:53,580
green investment thing because I'd like 
them to do well,

2855
02:04:53,581 --> 02:04:56,260
but I'm probably losing money.
RiGht.

2856
02:04:56,340 --> 02:04:57,060
You know what I mean?
Like,

2857
02:04:57,080 --> 02:04:58,080
I,
I like it.

2858
02:04:58,220 --> 02:05:01,200
It's a stupid way to my,
my financial guy was like,

2859
02:05:01,230 --> 02:05:04,670
this is stupid.
Just let me put it in petrochina,

2860
02:05:04,680 --> 02:05:06,390
lockheed martin,
koch g,

2861
02:05:06,420 --> 02:05:07,020
you know,
all that,

2862
02:05:07,320 --> 02:05:08,640
all these monoliths.

2863
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:13,210
And so you manaGed it,
you it,

2864
02:05:13,320 --> 02:05:13,890
then you did.

2865
02:05:14,980 --> 02:05:19,090
But I was discouraged by a,
by a relatively.

2866
02:05:19,091 --> 02:05:19,440
You know,

2867
02:05:19,610 --> 02:05:23,450
I see what I just.
It seems to me that the idea of shorting

2868
02:05:23,451 --> 02:05:25,550
seems crazy.
The idea that you can gamble,

2869
02:05:25,551 --> 02:05:30,551
that's when it's really gambling.
Anything else to me seems that it's 

2870
02:05:30,551 --> 02:05:30,551
investing.
You invest your money,

2871
02:05:30,551 --> 02:05:32,570
you buy shares of a stock that you 
believe in,

2872
02:05:32,720 --> 02:05:35,450
whether you believe in them because you 
like them or whether you believe in them

2873
02:05:35,451 --> 02:05:40,451
because you think it's a good.
It's a good investment that they're 

2874
02:05:40,451 --> 02:05:40,640
growing and they're going to continue to
grow.

2875
02:05:40,641 --> 02:05:45,641
You like the way they're set up.
I think that's one of the few naive 

2876
02:05:45,641 --> 02:05:46,100
point of view.
You hold your singing that like a singer

2877
02:05:46,180 --> 02:05:48,880
or holding their thing.
Why is that name?

2878
02:05:49,280 --> 02:05:54,280
Because people just are in the stock 
market to get to make a profit.

2879
02:05:54,770 --> 02:05:59,770
They're in it to make a profit,
but they look at this as this is gonna 

2880
02:05:59,770 --> 02:06:00,140
make a profit.
This is a good sound investment.

2881
02:06:00,141 --> 02:06:00,850
If I've done my bit,

2882
02:06:01,440 --> 02:06:03,170
I do with.
I liked the company.

2883
02:06:03,180 --> 02:06:04,750
I like.
It's just they haven't.

2884
02:06:04,840 --> 02:06:07,360
It doesn't have to do with that.
I can see that.

2885
02:06:07,361 --> 02:06:08,500
That doesn't have to have anything to do
with.

2886
02:06:08,501 --> 02:06:13,501
It could be that you just look at the,
they appear to be continuing to be 

2887
02:06:13,501 --> 02:06:13,720
profitable.
That makes sense to me though,

2888
02:06:13,721 --> 02:06:16,720
that you can invest in something that it
could be profitable.

2889
02:06:16,721 --> 02:06:21,721
I'm going to invest in.
It doesn't make the opposite where you 

2890
02:06:21,721 --> 02:06:21,721
go.
It's like because you're gambling,

2891
02:06:22,340 --> 02:06:27,340
that's what I don't understand you are.
You are literally saying I'm willing to 

2892
02:06:27,340 --> 02:06:28,600
bet a billion dollars that this fucking 
country,

2893
02:06:29,510 --> 02:06:30,910
if it goes up,
that's the thing.

2894
02:06:30,911 --> 02:06:32,620
It's not like it's the same

2895
02:06:33,440 --> 02:06:35,840
inverse of benny of investinG.
You're going,

2896
02:06:36,080 --> 02:06:40,390
you just basically you borrow money,
you borrow a million dollars.

2897
02:06:40,480 --> 02:06:41,310
Uh,
and,

2898
02:06:41,360 --> 02:06:43,760
and with that you have to start paying 
back.

2899
02:06:43,761 --> 02:06:43,970
You have to.

2900
02:06:44,300 --> 02:06:46,760
I understand that.
I understand the concept.

2901
02:06:46,761 --> 02:06:49,210
I just,
I see it as just the inverse.

2902
02:06:49,280 --> 02:06:52,550
It seems fucking crazy.
Luckily I'm not in finance,

2903
02:06:53,240 --> 02:06:54,110
nor you.
Brian,

2904
02:06:54,680 --> 02:06:57,160
what are you doing with your sleeves,
todd?

2905
02:06:57,250 --> 02:06:59,530
Doing it is how you are trying to play 
this.

2906
02:06:59,580 --> 02:07:02,640
Neil's rolling up and for a long time I 
think.

2907
02:07:02,950 --> 02:07:07,950
I think this is it.
Let's bring this back to the barn to 

2908
02:07:07,950 --> 02:07:07,950
bring it home.
Bring it to the bar.

2909
02:07:08,960 --> 02:07:11,120
Thank you everybody for tuning in.
Thank you neal brennan.
