1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,370
Do Do,
do four,

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:03,660
three,
two,

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:04,890
one,

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:07,950
and we're live.
Candice.

5
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:09,600
Hi Guys.
Hi.

6
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:11,400
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

7
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:13,290
What do you.
What were you saying about hereditary?

8
00:00:13,291 --> 00:00:14,640
That's supposed to be a terrifying 
movie,

9
00:00:14,641 --> 00:00:15,930
right?
That's what they said.

10
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:20,990
That's what they say.
Meaning the media and a like Huffington 

11
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:22,080
Post.
I think so that's why I went because I.

12
00:00:22,081 --> 00:00:25,110
I'm not scared by anything like in the 
movies,

13
00:00:25,111 --> 00:00:28,980
so I'm constantly in pursuit of a actual
scary movie.

14
00:00:28,981 --> 00:00:29,790
So I went thinking,
oh,

15
00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:31,580
this might be the one.
It was not.

16
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:33,360
Damn,
you're that hard.

17
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:38,390
That no movies get you.
I can't remember the last time I was 

18
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:38,670
scared,
but I think poltergeist when I was a kid

19
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,030
and that's why I'm scared of clowns as 
an adult though.

20
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:47,390
No,
I'm trying to think of the last time I 

21
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:48,120
was really scared and well see?

22
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:53,790
Yeah,
see they don't make well they're fun.

23
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,350
I like them.
That's how I feel.

24
00:00:55,351 --> 00:00:59,100
I like and I also like a thinking that 
something might get me.

25
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,620
I like the suspense in that,
but it never does.

26
00:01:01,621 --> 00:01:03,450
I always get.
It's very anticlimactic for me.

27
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:07,240
You like thinking that something might 
get you scared and it doesn't.

28
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,580
It doesn't.
It does not.

29
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:13,970
Jamie,
when was the last time you were scared 

30
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:13,970
and the movie said jump scares or that's
like cheap,

31
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:14,900
cheap scares.
That's not.

32
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,830
That doesn't count.
Just because to make it out loud,

33
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,630
it doesn't get that.
That doesn't count.

34
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,240
I don't go see scary movies at the 
theater.

35
00:01:21,241 --> 00:01:23,010
So.
So you're always at home,

36
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,300
so you know.
Yeah.

37
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:26,250
Yeah.
The strangers.

38
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:30,400
That one bothered me a little bit.
I was just in the weather.

39
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:35,480
No,
I was just holding on that list is 

40
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:35,480
something to come in.

41
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,860
I was just sending out my instagram 
stories,

42
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,060
instagram stories,
but yeah.

43
00:01:39,061 --> 00:01:40,320
No the strangers.
Did you see that one?

44
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,660
No.
That one was with Liv.

45
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:46,830
Tyler Stevens tasks on there were 
outside of the trying to kill people.

46
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,330
Yeah.
That one rocked me.

47
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,230
Uh,
a little.

48
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:50,970
A little.
Yeah.

49
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,450
Something about the dark.
Right.

50
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:59,480
You ever mind fuck yourself and you,
you think that there's like someone 

51
00:01:59,480 --> 00:01:59,790
outside,
like you think you hear something,

52
00:01:59,791 --> 00:02:02,940
you open your door and you listen.
And that actually has happened to me.

53
00:02:02,941 --> 00:02:04,700
I had a peeping Tom.
Ooh,

54
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:09,180
I had a real guy outside of my window,
so I didn't see him.

55
00:02:09,181 --> 00:02:10,630
I only heard him,
oh,

56
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:15,740
my window was cracked and uh,
he started whispering to me through my 

57
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:16,030
window.
I talk,

58
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:21,170
I have a joke about it now because it 
was only way I could deal with it 

59
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:21,170
without getting too paranoid about it.

60
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,680
So I wrote a joke about it,
but I did,

61
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:28,880
I did.
But every time I tell people they're 

62
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:28,880
like,
that's terrifying.

63
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:28,880
And I'm like,
yeah,

64
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:28,880
that is terrifying.
But at the same time it's like,

65
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:33,790
was kind of flattering,
kind of flattering out of his way to 

66
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:34,430
whisper all the windows he could gotten 
to.

67
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,910
He came to mind,
you know,

68
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,380
so.
But yeah,

69
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,720
we'll see what the guy looked like.
I didn't but my neighbors.

70
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:43,050
So he came one night and I heard him,
he started whispering to me.

71
00:02:43,051 --> 00:02:44,020
He was like,
can I,

72
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,230
I'll just tell you what he said.
It was terrifying.

73
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:48,240
I was watching also let me give the 
setup.

74
00:02:48,241 --> 00:02:50,580
I was watching Mulholland drive.
Have you seen,

75
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,610
are you a David Lynch Lynch?
That's what I had on,

76
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,590
um,
I'm a David Lynch fan and I had that.

77
00:02:55,591 --> 00:02:58,530
I was probably like 3:00
in the morning and uh,

78
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:01,750
I sleep with my window open because my 
place is not have ac,

79
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:04,470
but I know what,
what do you,

80
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:04,590
what?

81
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,190
Do you live in Montana?
Yes,

82
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:07,960
I had,
I just drove in for this today.

83
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:14,080
How can I live in la?
I lived at my place is old and I think 

84
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,180
what happened was,
is that it was built before ace was even

85
00:03:16,181 --> 00:03:21,181
invented so the windows are even old 
school so I can't even put like a 

86
00:03:21,181 --> 00:03:23,830
portable fake crank open and the windows
crank open like that.

87
00:03:23,831 --> 00:03:28,831
So you can't even,
I'd have to probably like get the 

88
00:03:28,831 --> 00:03:31,111
manager to replace the window 
installments before I could even put an 

89
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:31,320
air conditioning.
And so you survived this.

90
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:36,350
I don't know,
I just leave during the day and then at 

91
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:36,590
night I have fans.
Would that just blow hot?

92
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,960
No,
I know it's awful.

93
00:03:37,961 --> 00:03:39,340
Or I just spend the night at a friend's 
place.

94
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:40,900
That's the move.
That is the move.

95
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:43,060
I'm like,
I'll be here now.

96
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,590
Now I know the address,

97
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:47,360
so Chile,
nice and perfect.

98
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:49,670
It's got its own thermostat.
This room does.

99
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,680
This is amazing.
I hate you.

100
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:55,850
So we're friends trying to make me feel 
bad.

101
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:59,010
Don't feel bad for your accomplishments.
This is.

102
00:03:59,030 --> 00:03:59,520
No,
that's just.

103
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:04,690
This is what I want.
I want that pink Himalayan salt light 

104
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:04,690
right there.
That one.

105
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:04,690
I can take that.
Yeah,

106
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:05,390
you can take that.
Got.

107
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,560
We've got an extra one.
Random Pink Himalayan salt rocks.

108
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:14,800
Joe Rogan.
You have a stuff werewolf outside in a 

109
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:14,800
float tank,
whatever.

110
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,790
I don't think it's stuffed.
It's not that.

111
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,110
It'd be like a real thing and then you 
kill it.

112
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,040
That is what it is,
right?

113
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:23,270
That wasn't real.
No matter if it was just a polar bear.

114
00:04:23,271 --> 00:04:24,140
Scary than that.

115
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:28,460
If anybody were to have a,
an actual werewolf,

116
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,760
it would be you.
Can I.

117
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,950
Can I explain it to my peeping toms 
please?

118
00:04:33,951 --> 00:04:37,010
Cute.
So I heard him outside.

119
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:42,690
It was the summertime.
I think it was probably like July of 

120
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:43,270
this was I think like two years ago.
Yeah,

121
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,510
it wasn't.
It wasn't awful.

122
00:04:44,511 --> 00:04:47,270
It wasn't like it is like now because 
this is kind of new.

123
00:04:47,271 --> 00:04:50,480
I don't think La has ever been this hot 
in like the beginning of July,

124
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,250
so that's the end of days.
Um,

125
00:04:52,251 --> 00:04:57,251
so anyway I was in my bed watching 
mulholland drive and I had been like in 

126
00:04:57,251 --> 00:05:01,031
and out of like falling asleep and then 
all of a sudden I heard like a outside 

127
00:05:01,341 --> 00:05:06,341
of my window.
But I thought at first I thought it was 

128
00:05:06,341 --> 00:05:07,490
this movie because I was like,
David Lynch is a weird dude.

129
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:12,530
Like this is like a director's choice,
like to creep people out to put like 

130
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,890
murmuring in the background I did.
I thought that at first.

131
00:05:15,891 --> 00:05:20,891
So I ignored it.
And then like probably 20 minutes later 

132
00:05:20,891 --> 00:05:20,891
I was like,
something's telling.

133
00:05:20,891 --> 00:05:21,770
My Gut was like,
that's not the movie.

134
00:05:21,771 --> 00:05:24,350
So I hit mute and all of a sudden I 
heard,

135
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,260
come on baby from that sweet pussy.

136
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,790
So you're on the first floor.
I'm on the first floor.

137
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,430
My duplex.
It is.

138
00:05:34,431 --> 00:05:34,940
Well,
you know,

139
00:05:34,941 --> 00:05:39,941
anyone that's on the first floor,
your upstairs neighbors are problematic 

140
00:05:39,941 --> 00:05:42,890
because it sounds like they were a horse
shoes and they're bowling all the time.

141
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,270
So yeah,
the whole.

142
00:05:44,271 --> 00:05:45,350
Yeah,
no the whole thing,

143
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,760
living on the first floor is not a good 
idea,

144
00:05:46,761 --> 00:05:50,450
but we have bars unlike most of the 
windows,

145
00:05:50,451 --> 00:05:55,451
so that's not an issue.
Like I wasn't scared he was going to 

146
00:05:55,451 --> 00:05:58,151
come in because the windows open,
but then there's bars in front of it so 

147
00:05:58,151 --> 00:05:58,430
I wasn't terrified that.
Um,

148
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,320
but as soon as that happened,
what was funny was that uh,

149
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,350
Ian Edwards,
you know,

150
00:06:03,351 --> 00:06:08,351
Ian Edwards,
very funny comic working with them 

151
00:06:08,351 --> 00:06:08,930
tonight.
Do I have at the store?

152
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,060
No Ice House.
The Ice House.

153
00:06:11,061 --> 00:06:11,510
Okay.
Yeah.

154
00:06:11,511 --> 00:06:12,410
No,
um,

155
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:17,890
he was staying with me at the time 
because he had just sold his place and 

156
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:18,830
receding,
which isn't far from here.

157
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,830
And then he was in our extra room at the
apartment.

158
00:06:21,831 --> 00:06:23,230
So I was like,
Ian,

159
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,280
I think there's somebody outside.
Can you like,

160
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:30,200
do you want to get indigo?
Who that was all I had.

161
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:32,830
What do you say it about Ian?
You don't think he can protect me?

162
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:34,270
He's Jamaican.
He's crazy.

163
00:06:34,271 --> 00:06:39,130
I love Ian Hart.
He's not the one that called.

164
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,410
Weighs 18 pounds.
Weighs less than me.

165
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:44,320
Yeah.
I'm careful when I hug him a hug.

166
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:49,420
I hug you more firmly than I hug you.
I'm trying to get him to eat meat.

167
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:51,550
He told me he'll eat all my elk meat.
No,

168
00:06:51,551 --> 00:06:52,550
he said he will.
Yeah,

169
00:06:52,551 --> 00:06:53,920
he just won't.
He said he will.

170
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,270
You don't believe him?
No.

171
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,820
He's lying.
Yeah,

172
00:06:57,821 --> 00:06:59,340
I think he's just doing that to a.
Oh no,

173
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:01,650
he's asked me several times to try.
Yeah.

174
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:06,660
He wants me to cook elk forum and he'll 
eat it because he'll know it's a hunted 

175
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,080
animal because he's a Vegan.
He doesn't want to eat anything that was

176
00:07:08,081 --> 00:07:10,870
killed like from a factory farm or along
those lines.

177
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,400
I don't eat meat either.

178
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,200
Like I do.
Occasionally I'll have fish.

179
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:16,630
When Ian and I fly,
every time we fly together,

180
00:07:16,631 --> 00:07:19,230
I take a picture of him five minutes 
into the flight because he's always like

181
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:22,180
out cold five minutes and I'm like,
dude,

182
00:07:22,181 --> 00:07:24,910
what the fuck?
It's first thing in the morning.

183
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:26,800
We're supposed to be like,
you just woke up.

184
00:07:26,801 --> 00:07:29,470
How are you going back to sleep?
He's always so tired and I do.

185
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,010
I go,
dude,

186
00:07:30,011 --> 00:07:32,170
you got to get blood work done.
It's your fucking diet.

187
00:07:32,171 --> 00:07:34,290
I know it is.
You can do that Vegan Diet.

188
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:37,360
Right,
but you got to be very disciplined.

189
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,500
You have to.
Yeah.

190
00:07:38,501 --> 00:07:43,501
You have to take all sorts of different 
moments and you have to use algae if 

191
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:47,130
algae,
and that's the best source of b12.

192
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:50,230
It's not as bioavailable as animal 
sources.

193
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:53,440
You know all,
all the fat soluble vitamins.

194
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,940
This is just a.
it's a nightmare.

195
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:56,110
You've got to really be on the ball.

196
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,380
Yeah.
He's not know Ian.

197
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:59,870
I don't know if he is on the ball very 
well.

198
00:07:59,871 --> 00:08:02,950
He was just on my podcast the other day 
and he taught it.

199
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:05,810
It's called the struggle and the 
struggle,

200
00:08:05,811 --> 00:08:10,640
so I had about life in Atlanta.
Just yes,

201
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:15,940
that's an ongoing that in my dating 
struggle or the ongoing dating 

202
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,840
struggling and not having air 
conditioning in.

203
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,040
You had a nice fellow with you at the 
comedy store the other night.

204
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:23,410
He seemed like a good guy.
He has since been recorded.

205
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:26,660
Yes.
It was very brief.

206
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,580
Well,
you seem like a nice fellow.

207
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:29,660
I thought so too.

208
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:37,300
It's not that he's not nice.
He just had lived a lifestyle that I 

209
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:37,300
just can't.
That we're not.

210
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,290
We're not compatible.
We'll still be friends.

211
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:40,700
I think.
I think we can get to the point,

212
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:42,350
won't be friends because we were friends
first.

213
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,380
So I think we can maintain that if I 
can't,

214
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:46,790
you know,
the struggle.

215
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:50,630
Everything is a struggle.
The struggle is real evidence.

216
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:53,330
That's why I have people on it and we 
just talk about stuff that everyone's.

217
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,740
Everyone's struggling with something and
multiple things usually.

218
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:55,950
Well

219
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:58,350
I find this is just a rash 
generalization,

220
00:08:58,351 --> 00:09:03,351
but I'm good at those.
I find that women when they're in the 

221
00:09:04,351 --> 00:09:08,460
prime of their life as a like not,
not like 20,

222
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:13,610
but like as an actual grown woman with a
career and if they're smart and 

223
00:09:14,461 --> 00:09:16,860
independent,
they have a really hard time finding the

224
00:09:16,861 --> 00:09:18,130
right man.
Absolutely.

225
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:22,050
It's like if you're a that if you're a 
Dingbat and you'll,

226
00:09:22,051 --> 00:09:27,051
you know,
you'll morph into whatever lifestyle 

227
00:09:27,051 --> 00:09:29,331
your new boyfriend chooses,
then you can be okay because you don't 

228
00:09:29,331 --> 00:09:30,690
know who you are,
but it's hard for a girl to find.

229
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:35,740
First of all,
it's hard for a girl who's strong and 

230
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,271
smart,
defined a guy who's not intimidated by 

231
00:09:38,271 --> 00:09:40,560
that.
It is you.

232
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,720
This is my life.
I know.

233
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:48,220
I know so many women who were in my 
situation because women in their 

234
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:51,860
thirties independent have money and just
like,

235
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:54,000
don't need a man,
but just want one.

236
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:56,550
Right?
But the dudes can't handle it well.

237
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:58,110
Well,
it's hard.

238
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:03,140
It's hard both ways.
It's hard finding quality human beings 

239
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,340
to spend time with friends,
girlfriends,

240
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:06,600
boyfriends,
whoever it is.

241
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:07,440
It's,
it's hard.

242
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,060
It's hard finding the right.
I mean,

243
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,200
yeah,
especially in La,

244
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,400
especially in our line of work,
you know,

245
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,920
we're in the attention business,
you know,

246
00:10:14,921 --> 00:10:17,010
and we get attention to professionally,
right?

247
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,250
And make people laugh.
That's the business.

248
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:22,260
A fucking tricky business.
I don't know what you're talking about.

249
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,850
Well listen,
you have you,

250
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,770
you have one of the healthiest 
attitudes,

251
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:30,860
like you really do.
I always say this about you when 

252
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:30,860
whenever we're at the store,
like you always have these,

253
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:34,050
you have the grind spots,
you get those grind spots in the store,

254
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,090
you get those 12:00
spots,

255
00:10:36,091 --> 00:10:38,480
1130.
So those are the grind spots that show's

256
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:40,080
been on for three and a half hours.

257
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,870
By the time you get on,
you know that's rough,

258
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,840
but you're always,
you always have a positive attitude.

259
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,000
Always happy,
always smiling.

260
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,160
Everybody's always happy to see you.
People never like,

261
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:54,660
oh,
just say like some people do,

262
00:10:54,661 --> 00:10:56,610
but those are the hater.
I don't know who they are.

263
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,320
I don't know.
I don't associate with those people,

264
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,660
but all my friends are always happy to 
see you.

265
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:01,860
You're,
you're very happy,

266
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,100
very happy.
It's my parents love me the Ah,

267
00:11:05,101 --> 00:11:07,000
there it is.
Well that's your fuck.

268
00:11:07,001 --> 00:11:11,090
Then you're never gonna make it in this 
town that all the time.

269
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,530
I say if my parents had been just a 
little bit more abusive,

270
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:18,900
pulled the Joe Jackson at least just 
wants it twice.

271
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,300
Yeah.
Joe Jackson.

272
00:11:21,301 --> 00:11:23,730
He just passed away,
rip Joe Jackson.

273
00:11:23,731 --> 00:11:26,640
We were just reading about him.
People have been sending me these things

274
00:11:26,641 --> 00:11:30,450
that Dr Conrad Murray says that Michael 
Jackson was chemically castrated.

275
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:31,560
Oh yeah,
I heard about that.

276
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:32,280
Yeah,
I had.

277
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:36,380
I said that a long time ago that I 
thought he was [inaudible].

278
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:41,920
Do you know that the word for Toronto is
something that they use to do two young 

279
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:46,140
boys to get them to sing opera better?
You ever heard this before?

280
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,160
I wonder if Aaron Neville has.
I don't think so.

281
00:11:50,161 --> 00:11:54,160
I think he's just doing a falsetto 
because when you hear him he talks

282
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,000
like this man,
Michael Jackson also talk like this too.

283
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,490
By the way,
was faint.

284
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,610
Bell is fake.
Did you hear?

285
00:12:00,611 --> 00:12:02,500
I speak it all.
This Conrad Murray,

286
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:07,740
he taught his voice was like this.
Conrad Murray has a recording on his 

287
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,860
phone that he just played.
I just.

288
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:13,950
There was some documentary I just 
watched and it was Michael Jackson's 

289
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:14,190
like last words,
like on his deathbed,

290
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:14,950
his,
his deep voice

291
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:25,190
woman to see the door

292
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,150
fuck out of here.
That sounds like your girl does.

293
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,400
It does.
It does like a girl want some Dick.

294
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:38,070
See that was his real voice to that is 
not deep,

295
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,090
but it's not.

296
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,920
Not this joined in a common purpose.

297
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:46,700
Listen,
when that is his deep voice.

298
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:51,340
Sounds like he's got a cold.
That's like my eight year old.

299
00:12:51,341 --> 00:12:53,660
Would she has a cold?
No one said it was deep,

300
00:12:53,661 --> 00:12:57,000
but it's not that this is what this is.
And why do all of them.

301
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,270
Why does Janet talk like this?
And the toy.

302
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,940
They all got beaten by their dad.
But what does that mean?

303
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,710
So that now they all have this stay low 
key they have to talk to.

304
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,280
If you,
um,

305
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:09,670
do you read the stories,
the chemical,

306
00:13:09,671 --> 00:13:14,671
castor oil.
This play her a sound of a real cast 

307
00:13:14,671 --> 00:13:17,080
Toronto because there's only one 
recording from the early 19 hundreds.

308
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:22,490
It was like some of the last of the 
[inaudible] because they don't do that 

309
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:22,570
anymore,
but they used to do it.

310
00:13:22,571 --> 00:13:27,571
It was very common.
People would give their children to the 

311
00:13:27,571 --> 00:13:28,330
opera.
Awful.

312
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:32,200
Will they get us kicked off youtube.
James,

313
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:33,700
get up,
do some finagling.

314
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:36,250
We get kicked off youtube all the time.
Shit.

315
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:41,530
Things that are other people's 
copyrights here.

316
00:13:41,531 --> 00:13:43,360
This is a boy is a boy.
Yeah,

317
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,780
this is what.
That's what he needs to look like.

318
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:47,830
I mean,
you know,

319
00:13:47,831 --> 00:13:50,410
he was castrated,
so he had no hormones.

320
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:55,470
His body did not produce testosterone 
and so this is a grown adult male,

321
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:03,080
but like saying like this,
why wouldn't they just let the women 

322
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:03,080
saying it?
No,

323
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,510
because it's a different thing to 
different sound.

324
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:07,270
Like the women sound beautiful and they 
sound like women,

325
00:14:07,271 --> 00:14:10,870
but there's a sound that [inaudible] has
and that's a Michael Jackson sound.

326
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:14,590
The sound is a extremely feminine,
not look,

327
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:15,430
look,
it's real.

328
00:14:15,431 --> 00:14:18,250
Like if you think you see tito and all 
the other Jackson's,

329
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:22,180
they don't sound nothing with Jermaine.
Not No one looks or sounds

330
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,190
anything.
No.

331
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,820
He was definitely the standout.
But.

332
00:14:24,821 --> 00:14:26,560
So you think they did this to him when 
he was a kid.

333
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,880
This is where Conrad Murray says,
and he looked.

334
00:14:28,881 --> 00:14:33,881
It makes sense if you look at his body,
if you look at like he didn't have any 

335
00:14:33,881 --> 00:14:34,370
muscle tone.
He was very slender.

336
00:14:34,371 --> 00:14:37,100
He looked like he had no testosterone.
You sound like a girl.

337
00:14:37,101 --> 00:14:42,101
He sang like a girl.
Tell him that it's human nature that 

338
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,720
actually it's not bad to think about 
that.

339
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:47,030
Think about that voice.
Who the fuck's things like,

340
00:14:47,031 --> 00:14:47,630
that's a man.

341
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:48,450
No,
you're right.

342
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:49,920
And I always thought he,
I,

343
00:14:49,921 --> 00:14:53,060
I never pictured him like four.
Took him for a sexual person at all.

344
00:14:53,061 --> 00:14:55,580
Like when people were like they said he 
was touching little boys.

345
00:14:55,581 --> 00:14:58,400
I never believed that.
I always felt he was asexual.

346
00:14:58,401 --> 00:15:03,401
I didn't get any type of sexual,
any chemistry or any type of tension at 

347
00:15:03,401 --> 00:15:03,920
all from him.

348
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:06,570
Did you check them out with the Ligo 
detector?

349
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:10,600
I have a gate the gate and I have the 
actual.

350
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:15,020
I bought mine on Amazon.
Yeah,

351
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:20,070
I think it's entirely possible that 
that's true because I've thought about 

352
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:20,070
that.
We,

353
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:21,940
we talked about that for years.
I was like,

354
00:15:21,941 --> 00:15:22,810
dude,
I'm telling you.

355
00:15:22,811 --> 00:15:24,970
I heard those kiss Kratos I know about 
that.

356
00:15:24,971 --> 00:15:27,100
I guarantee you Joe Jackson knew about 
that too.

357
00:15:27,101 --> 00:15:29,210
I bet they did that to that kid.
That's awful.

358
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:31,840
So they did.
They use chemical castration.

359
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:38,480
I heard that that had happened,
but I always thought it was like for 

360
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:38,480
some reason I thought it was when he was
an adult.

361
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,480
I thought it was like a personal choice 
that he made.

362
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,000
Ooh,
whoa.

363
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:46,390
No.
I think the idea was his dad was trying 

364
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:46,390
to preserve his voice.

365
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:46,390
I didn't.
I didn't know that.

366
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:49,780
So wait a chemical castration.
Is that what that means?

367
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,610
But with what,
like,

368
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:56,760
good question.
Is it something that you take that lid 

369
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,700
doesn't like shrivel up your balls,
but like something that just makes you 

370
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,980
in like in like you don't have the 
ability to produce test

371
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:03,210
anymore?
Well,

372
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:08,240
let's find out here it says allegations 
are Joe had Michael received Hormone 

373
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:13,040
Jackson when he was 12 years old in an 
effort to cure his acting and prevent 

374
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,431
his voice from deepening an allegation 
Mervis Marie previously made and it's 

375
00:16:16,431 --> 00:16:20,560
2016 self published book.
This is the secret life of Dr Conrad 

376
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:20,670
Murray and Michael Jackson.

377
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:21,850
Hmm.

378
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:29,300
Yeah.
He said Joe was physically abusive to 

379
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,701
him and his siblings were growing up but
never mentioned undergoing any sort of 

380
00:16:31,701 --> 00:16:32,490
hormonal treatments.
But this is what Conrad Murray says,

381
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:33,500
I just don't.
I don't know.

382
00:16:33,501 --> 00:16:36,520
I mean,
who you sound like crazy.

383
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:40,260
The reason why I believe it is because 
of the way sounded just make sense.

384
00:16:40,261 --> 00:16:44,850
And His dad was just a ruthless prick.
He was known as being a horrible person.

385
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,330
Yeah.
But why?

386
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:51,360
Why would,
why would he only do that to one of his 

387
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:51,360
sons?

388
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,830
Because he was the only one that was 
young enough to do it too.

389
00:16:52,831 --> 00:16:55,620
If you look at the Jackson five when 
they were taken off like,

390
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:58,890
oh baby gave me one moment.
He was five,

391
00:16:58,891 --> 00:17:00,600
six years old.
Everybody else was grown.

392
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:01,800
There was too late.
Yeah.

393
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:06,890
They were all deep in.
Were already there were already grown 

394
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:06,890
men.
And this was,

395
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:09,780
this was the voice.
I mean he was the voice ABC.

396
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,820
I mean,
he was so fucking cute too.

397
00:17:11,821 --> 00:17:16,680
They try to keep that going forever.
That's why I think that's unfortunate.

398
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:18,330
It's scary.
Well he's,

399
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:21,150
he's a cautionary tale,
you know,

400
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:26,400
and I think there's a level of fame that
you get to where you just fucked up.

401
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:28,470
You got to fucking famous.

402
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,200
Yeah.
But isn't it?

403
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:34,430
Isn't it also like the,
a certain type of person only wants that

404
00:17:34,431 --> 00:17:36,140
level of fame,
right?

405
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:38,660
Like have you ever thought about like 
people who get to like,

406
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:44,080
for example,
like Donald trump level because it 

407
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:44,080
doesn't just apply to like,
uh,

408
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,830
the entertainment industry,
but like CEOS who these multibillion 

409
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:50,550
dollar own these multibillion dollar 
corporations,

410
00:17:50,551 --> 00:17:53,880
like it takes a certain type of person 
to even want that type of clout,

411
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:55,980
you know?
And uh,

412
00:17:56,070 --> 00:18:01,070
I don't know.
I think that there's something in that 

413
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:01,070
as well.
I don't know.

414
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:03,880
I think there's a pursuit involved in 
all of these things where you start off 

415
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,680
just chasing money and you start off and
then you get involved in a game and it's

416
00:18:06,681 --> 00:18:09,440
all about numbers.
It's all about putting scores up,

417
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:14,470
you know?
And I think as those scores continue to 

418
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:16,961
pile on,
you continue to get more excited about 

419
00:18:16,961 --> 00:18:16,961
your progress and you want to keep going
further.

420
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:18,500
If someone makes a million dollars a 
year,

421
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:19,880
they don't go,
that's good.

422
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:20,930
That's good enough.
No,

423
00:18:20,931 --> 00:18:22,190
they go,
I want 2 million.

424
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:27,460
They make 2 million.
I want a marriage and they get a 

425
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:27,460
mansion.
I want a jet,

426
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,100
they get a jet,
I want to fucking island.

427
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:31,470
I have always wondered like when is it 
enough for people?

428
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,180
Because like I,
I,

429
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:35,550
I'm the type of person I don't think I 
would be like that.

430
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:40,790
Like if I had $25,
million dollars and somebody was like,

431
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:46,320
you have to do this to get another $25 
million depending upon what it is.

432
00:18:46,321 --> 00:18:51,321
If it was something that I didn't 
believe in or something that wasn't 

433
00:18:51,321 --> 00:18:51,321
aligned with my morals,
I wouldn't.

434
00:18:51,321 --> 00:18:52,420
I'd be like,
I already have $25,000,000.

435
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:53,730
Yeah,
I don't need it that bad.

436
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:56,040
Well yeah.
I mean that's different though.

437
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:58,560
You're saying like if something was not 
aligned with your morals,

438
00:18:58,561 --> 00:19:01,350
but if you had $25,000,000
and you had an opportunity to make 30.

439
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:06,840
If it was yes,
but there are a couple extra hours a 

440
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,020
weekend.
Is that all it takes?

441
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,130
Yeah.
Maybe just a few.

442
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:11,100
Five extra hours a week,
an extra hour a day.

443
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:13,410
And we could ramp you up to $30,000,000
a year.

444
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:15,840
Well,
I would do that and then we go,

445
00:19:15,841 --> 00:19:16,560
listen,
candice,

446
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:19,770
we can get you really close to 
$75,000,000

447
00:19:19,771 --> 00:19:24,771
a year,
but you're going to have to work 12 

448
00:19:24,771 --> 00:19:24,771
hours a day.
Sorry,

449
00:19:24,771 --> 00:19:25,920
I can't come up to you to go kill the 
hours.

450
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:27,370
I can just.
I know what you're saying.

451
00:19:27,371 --> 00:19:28,630
I know you think it's hard,
but listen,

452
00:19:28,631 --> 00:19:32,560
we get some adderall and we've got some 
massage therapists that will be on staff

453
00:19:32,561 --> 00:19:37,561
and if we do this for a few years,
you retire comfortably for the rest of 

454
00:19:37,561 --> 00:19:37,561
your life.
You live in a Baeza.

455
00:19:37,561 --> 00:19:39,590
You fucking chill out in the hammock.
Oh No,

456
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:44,730
never happens.
That's the thing that a bs of thing 

457
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:44,730
never happens.
The hammock never,

458
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:45,330
never written on the hammock.
You just keep making them.

459
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:46,520
For me,
it would come.

460
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,920
The only reason I'm working is so I can 
stop working.

461
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,790
Oh really?

462
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:52,230
Yes.
What's going to hit?

463
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:52,800
What number?

464
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:58,400
I would be fine with.
I'm gonna.

465
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:00,850
I'm going to go with a $200.

466
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:05,730
That's all you need.
Low maintenance.

467
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,600
Jesus Christ.
How much is it to buy an island?

468
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,670
Uh,
depends on where it is.

469
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,040
If it's where hurricanes hit all the 
time,

470
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:17,120
but you get to cheat and get it for 75.
Somebody Richard Branson bought one last

471
00:20:17,121 --> 00:20:22,121
year and right after he bought it,
it got destroyed literally to the point 

472
00:20:22,121 --> 00:20:24,350
where there are no living humans for the
first time in 300 years on this island.

473
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:29,300
Oh No.
He didn't do research.

474
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,220
Well,
it just got unlucky.

475
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,650
He just bought it and right after he 
bought it,

476
00:20:33,651 --> 00:20:38,651
it literally the epicenter of the 
hurricane washed over it and just the 

477
00:20:38,651 --> 00:20:43,181
entire island.
If you're listening to this Richard 

478
00:20:43,181 --> 00:20:43,181
Branson,
I'm not.

479
00:20:43,181 --> 00:20:43,181
I don't mean to laugh at you.
Pull up the story.

480
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:46,820
Branson's island last time you've talked
about it,

481
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,070
a necker

482
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,720
island,
the one that he's owned for awhile,

483
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,410
it was going to be reopened and a couple
months,

484
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,520
so they redid it.
Yeah.

485
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:57,580
It's like back back those necker.
I don't like the way that like niggardly

486
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:00,910
that word.
That's a dangerous word.

487
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:06,060
Like selfish and stingy people.
People are saying don't use that word 

488
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,490
anymore because it sounds too much like 
that other one does,

489
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,810
but it's not the same.
I know it's not,

490
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,260
but it's tricky.
It is tricky.

491
00:21:11,261 --> 00:21:14,520
You have to pronounce every letter or 
delete.

492
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:15,740
Delete.
Yeah,

493
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:21,340
that's a problem.
You know what's weird when words are 

494
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,290
okay sometimes like pussy cat.
Yeah.

495
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:27,900
How do you have to have another.
But right now the game,

496
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:33,640
it's not the same year.
You can't say that on daytime top.

497
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:34,840
That is weird though,
right?

498
00:21:34,841 --> 00:21:36,520
That you could say pussy cat.
Yeah.

499
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:38,710
But if you say pussy one,
two,

500
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,630
three cat.
Yeah.

501
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:41,860
That's like,
Hey,

502
00:21:41,861 --> 00:21:45,220
I don't like what you did there unless 
you named your cat pussy.

503
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:49,240
Oh yeah.
I guess octopussy remember that?

504
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:50,270
That was a big deal.
Everyone's okay.

505
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,360
Yeah.
No,

506
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:54,080
I remember seeing that.
Uh,

507
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:56,170
this is what I think with when we lived 
in New York,

508
00:21:56,171 --> 00:21:56,950
it was a movie,
right?

509
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:57,690
Yes.
Yeah.

510
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:01,090
I remember seeing it like I was a kid 
and I remember seeing it like.

511
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:04,480
And I was like,
what is a bad word to say it?

512
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:08,310
That was like a loophole in there.
Yeah.

513
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,920
There's some words that are like that.
Well,

514
00:22:10,921 --> 00:22:14,940
how about a dude named Dick Cheney?

515
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:19,080
Everyone deserves that name.
Like I don't,

516
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,330
I don't know anyone.
I don't think,

517
00:22:20,331 --> 00:22:21,830
I think that's like one of those older 
school ones.

518
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:24,260
I feel like no one goes by.
If your name is Richard,

519
00:22:24,261 --> 00:22:27,850
you go by Richard or rich.
Now I don't think anybody's like,

520
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:28,520
call me Dick.

521
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:30,680
Who?
The weirdest one is Jack.

522
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:34,370
Like if you're John Your nicknames Jack.
Wait,

523
00:22:34,371 --> 00:22:35,720
no one's name is just Jack.
Yeah,

524
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:38,120
my nephew's named Jack will.
Who?

525
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,950
But John,
if you use just call me Jack.

526
00:22:42,951 --> 00:22:45,110
The nickname is jack.
I never knew that.

527
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:47,180
John Kennedy.
These calm Jack Kennedy.

528
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,520
I didn't know that.
Then this name was John.

529
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:51,310
That's so weird.
It's the same amount of letters.

530
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:56,440
It isn't it so stupid.
It doesn't make any sense.

531
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:02,420
Are there any ones like that for girls?
Will there's a.

532
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,280
no,
no,

533
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,530
not that I can think of.
I can't think of one.

534
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:10,010
Right.
There's no just named him Jack.

535
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,750
It's a completely different name.
It's a totally different name.

536
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,010
Sounds different.
Yeah.

537
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:14,790
Yeah.

538
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:16,420
Can we talk about,
since we're on the,

539
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:18,170
on the nickname thing,
so you know,

540
00:23:18,171 --> 00:23:20,270
we're not allowed to say tranny anymore.
Right?

541
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,760
You just said it.
I know because I don't.

542
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:27,020
I personally don't find anything wrong 
with the word and now someone could very

543
00:23:27,021 --> 00:23:27,440
well say,
well,

544
00:23:27,441 --> 00:23:29,390
you're not transgender candace,
you're not bothered by it.

545
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:31,430
You know,
it doesn't affect you,

546
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:36,490
but I don't know anyone that really used
it in a derogatory way.

547
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:37,860
You know,
I,

548
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,400
you know,
it was just a word that we said to refer

549
00:23:40,401 --> 00:23:44,870
to this type of person,
but to me it sounds adorable.

550
00:23:44,871 --> 00:23:46,490
Like me,
it's just the nickname

551
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:49,220
for transgender to say tranny.
So like Jennifer,

552
00:23:49,221 --> 00:23:54,221
you call somebody Jenny.
Well there's a lot of policing of 

553
00:23:54,221 --> 00:23:57,011
language as of late.
It's ramped up because the Internet 

554
00:23:57,011 --> 00:24:00,010
people can complain more,
but I think the problem is that it's 

555
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:03,371
not.
You're not putting any respect on that 

556
00:24:03,371 --> 00:24:03,371
name.
Is that what it is?

557
00:24:03,371 --> 00:24:05,280
It's a respect.
It sounds like it's a birdman.

558
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:08,330
Went to visit Charlotte may put some 
respect on my name,

559
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,600
respect of Spec,
put some respect on my name.

560
00:24:11,601 --> 00:24:14,000
Did you see that?
I didn't see the claimant.

561
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:17,510
Apparently Charlemagne had been talking 
some shit about Birdman.

562
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:22,840
Birdman came in with a giant crew and 
put some respect on my name and then he 

563
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,990
got up and left.
That was it.

564
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:26,780
It was the whole conversation.
And Charlotte.

565
00:24:26,781 --> 00:24:27,420
Woody's going.
Okay.

566
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:30,380
All right.
I love beef.

567
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:35,410
I love is.
You want to watch short good stars over 

568
00:24:37,491 --> 00:24:38,750
his head,
but crazy.

569
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:42,480
Looked at guys got come up.
Respect ms dot banks.

570
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:45,020
I'm playing with my fucking name.
All drill.

571
00:24:45,021 --> 00:24:48,140
Y'All stop playing with my name.
Ain't gonna say no.

572
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:52,160
Most hilarious and put some respect on 
my name.

573
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:53,380
Yeah,

574
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:58,700
man,
I was.

575
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:01,590
Were you following the drake and Pusha t
a?

576
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:05,720
I tried to not try to avoid it because 
Jamie brings these up.

577
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:06,730
He comes in.
Did you,

578
00:25:06,731 --> 00:25:10,210
did you hear about chopping with drake?
Drake has a kid with a porn star.

579
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:12,800
Yeah,
I get it all from Jamie.

580
00:25:12,801 --> 00:25:13,880
Jamie,
the gossip news.

581
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,430
TMZ of this,
uh,

582
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,600
this studio,
it gives me so much life.

583
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:19,730
Why do you love that?
I love.

584
00:25:19,731 --> 00:25:21,110
I love hurt feelings,
man.

585
00:25:21,111 --> 00:25:22,160
I love.
I do.

586
00:25:22,161 --> 00:25:24,860
I do.
When it's like celebrities.

587
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:27,850
Oh,
like they can get their feelings hurt up

588
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,310
because all they're doing is bragging 
and talking to all the money they have.

589
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:36,880
They,
if not braggy wrapper is not braggy 

590
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,430
rapper.
Yeah,

591
00:25:37,431 --> 00:25:38,170
that's.
Yeah,

592
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:39,530
that's what I'm talking about.
Like rap beefs.

593
00:25:39,531 --> 00:25:44,531
Yeah.
So if there was a beep between like 

594
00:25:44,531 --> 00:25:44,531
Jennifer Lawrence,
Scarlett,

595
00:25:44,531 --> 00:25:44,531
Johannsen,
would you like that?

596
00:25:44,531 --> 00:25:47,960
I mean that also would be entertaining.
That would also be entertaining.

597
00:25:47,961 --> 00:25:50,660
I'm not going to lie.
I would like to see one of them cry.

598
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:52,610
Whoa,
I'm here for it.

599
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,780
Why do you like hurt feelings?

600
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:59,060
Because we're all human.
We all get our feelings hurt and it's 

601
00:25:59,060 --> 00:25:59,060
nice to bring,
you know,

602
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,030
humbled people sometimes go.

603
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:02,230
Do you think of you're happier in your 
own life?

604
00:26:02,231 --> 00:26:07,231
You wouldn't like hurt feelings as much.
You just talked about me being a very 

605
00:26:07,231 --> 00:26:07,950
happy person.
Happier.

606
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,540
I'm not saying you're totally 100 
percent fulfilled.

607
00:26:10,541 --> 00:26:12,670
You were saying earlier that you can't 
find a good man.

608
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:17,170
That doesn't mean I'm not fulfilled who?
My Vagina,

609
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:22,300
but the rest of me spiritually,
emotionally,

610
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,430
you're happy even without.
So you're.

611
00:26:24,431 --> 00:26:24,620
So.

612
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:27,780
I'm a very happy person.
I've been single most of my life.

613
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:30,810
I believe it was to mean that you're 
happy.

614
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:35,420
I believe you've been your life.
I've always said that you're happy you.

615
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:38,210
We just got done.
You have.

616
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:40,680
How many years have I known you?
You've been nothing but friendly.

617
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:43,170
I mean,
what's to be mad about?

618
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:44,310
I'm just a grateful

619
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:46,020
person.
I wake up every morning and I'm like,

620
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:51,021
I'm just happy to be living this life.
It's a great life and he's a great 

621
00:26:51,021 --> 00:26:52,060
living as a up comedian.
Yeah,

622
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:53,910
that's about as good as it gets.
Well,

623
00:26:53,911 --> 00:26:54,930
yeah,
that's what you want,

624
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,440
but even people who who don't do standup
want to kind of be stand ups.

625
00:26:58,441 --> 00:27:03,441
They want to do a lot of people do.
A lot of Djs do radio djs secretly want 

626
00:27:06,261 --> 00:27:07,830
to be comics.
They think they're hilarious.

627
00:27:07,831 --> 00:27:10,500
There's a lot of them to do it secretly.
Absolutely.

628
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,530
That you come in and do morning radio 
and the like.

629
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:14,970
It's like the closest thing to what I 
think,

630
00:27:14,971 --> 00:27:16,200
right?
Because what?

631
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:21,230
I'm trying to think of another 
profession which is like standup comedy 

632
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:23,910
where you can like tell jokes and people
listen to you in the mass in the masses,

633
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,170
you know,
but I think,

634
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,450
yeah,
probably a radio is the closest thing to

635
00:27:27,451 --> 00:27:27,600
them.

636
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,460
Some radio djs are Dicks,
you know,

637
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:34,020
some of them they get kind of ego.
I think that's really what it is.

638
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:39,170
They also want to keep you on your heels
because they know that you could do 

639
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:39,170
their job,
but they can't do your job.

640
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:41,880
Like you could just be a radio DJ.
That shit is hard.

641
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:42,870
Yeah.
We're kind of doing it now.

642
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:45,330
Yeah.
We argued if you host a podcast,

643
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:50,610
you know how to do it.
You could easily take over some fucking 

644
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:53,091
radio show.
Tell that dude that dude to go on your 

645
00:27:53,091 --> 00:27:56,991
spot.
Eleven 45 and the fucking oh are after 

646
00:27:56,991 --> 00:27:57,570
joey ideas bitch.
Good luck.

647
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:01,250
Good fucking luck.
That's the I,

648
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:06,120
I find like with dudes just in general,
because it is mostly dudes.

649
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:11,150
I didn't,
I don't find women like competing with 

650
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:11,150
me to be funny most of the time that 
aren't comics,

651
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:13,290
but like even do two aren't comedians.

652
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:15,510
Like if I go on a date with them or were
dating,

653
00:28:15,511 --> 00:28:18,630
it's like they always try to one up me,
they tried to one up you,

654
00:28:18,631 --> 00:28:20,930
even though they know you're a comic 
because dude,

655
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,680
you know,
dudes,

656
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:23,370
they always want to just be that,
you know,

657
00:28:23,371 --> 00:28:25,920
the funny ones,
even if they're not gonna mix,

658
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:31,040
they want to be the funny one and it's 
like you don't have to be in and if 

659
00:28:31,381 --> 00:28:33,270
you're dating me like it doesn't,
that doesn't,

660
00:28:33,271 --> 00:28:36,000
I don't need that.
It's always good to have a dude that can

661
00:28:36,001 --> 00:28:37,830
make me laugh,
but I don't expect that.

662
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:40,320
But could you deal with a dude that's 
not funny at all?

663
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:40,680
No,
no,

664
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:41,680
no,
no,

665
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,120
no,
no.

666
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:42,960
He doesn't.
No.

667
00:28:42,961 --> 00:28:44,700
I don't want to do who has no sense of 
humor.

668
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:45,030
No,
no,

669
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:45,480
no,
no,

670
00:28:45,481 --> 00:28:45,750
no,
no.

671
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:48,120
Don't want to do no sense of humor at 
all.

672
00:28:48,121 --> 00:28:49,740
But I would like a dude who could,
like,

673
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,950
who can riff with me but also not 
intimidated by me.

674
00:28:52,951 --> 00:28:57,951
And doesn't feel like it'd be funnier 
than does going to be your problem 

675
00:28:57,951 --> 00:28:57,951
forever.
What that?

676
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:00,930
Well then I guess I'll just be single 
forever.

677
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:06,050
Forever.
Get a robot talking about making robot 

678
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:07,260
girlfriends get a sex robot.
A robot boyfriend.

679
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:08,780
Yeah.
They can open jars.

680
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:11,460
This is house will be at the fucking 
whole cancers.

681
00:29:11,461 --> 00:29:14,520
The door.
Every time his eyes move here.

682
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,490
Like what the fuck?
Candace,

683
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:19,050
what are you up to?
Well,

684
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:24,110
he couldn't save me the whole quill.
He fucks me and then he stays outside.

685
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:25,810
Looks out for petty.
Tom's.

686
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:30,520
He's stands guard outside my window.
Oh,

687
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:37,490
I want to have women are going to get 
there because I know God's going to get 

688
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:38,160
that hundred percent.
Did you see x Mokena?

689
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:40,500
I've loved it.
Loved it.

690
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,370
Loved.
It's one of my favorite movies ever.

691
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:42,670
Yeah.
No,

692
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,650
I watch it every,
every minute.

693
00:29:44,651 --> 00:29:45,650
I can.
Yeah.

694
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:46,960
I watched that movie at least three 
times.

695
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:49,060
Yeah.
But that scene,

696
00:29:49,061 --> 00:29:52,150
like when that guy had those girls,
there were girlfriends,

697
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:57,210
you know,
like the Japanese lady was dancing with 

698
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:57,210
my favorite scene.
Yeah.

699
00:29:57,210 --> 00:30:00,360
That is 100 percent going to happen.
That there's no way that's not going to 

700
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:03,891
happen.
Of course it's going to happen 100 

701
00:30:03,891 --> 00:30:03,891
percent.
Y'All don't want to talk to women.

702
00:30:03,891 --> 00:30:08,550
Why do you.
Why lump me in with all those other 

703
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:08,550
dudes?

704
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:08,770
Not You,
not you.

705
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:09,770
I mean,
you're looking at you.

706
00:30:09,771 --> 00:30:11,870
You're talking to a woman right now?
Yup.

707
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,870
I'm the.
I just realized I'm,

708
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,790
I saw a.
because you know,

709
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:19,150
I be watching the podcast and so you had
a.

710
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:24,180
Oh,
another black candice on not too long 

711
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:24,180
ago.
Yeah.

712
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,240
I'm the one that's not in the sunken 
place.

713
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:30,540
Sunken place was the sunken place.
I haven't seen that yet yet.

714
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,870
What are you waiting for?
It's not anymore.

715
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:37,780
Well,
most boys don't walk on the theaters.

716
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:39,080
Most movies.
Oh yeah.

717
00:30:39,081 --> 00:30:41,830
You're a celebrity.
You can't go to the movies.

718
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:44,950
Yes.
Then why do you say you just can't?

719
00:30:44,951 --> 00:30:46,960
You said you can't go to the movies.
Can't go to all of them.

720
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:49,420
That was a really good one.
You should have gone.

721
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:51,700
If I go to one movie a month,
that's a lot.

722
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:55,180
So I miss a lot of movies.
I got a little kids movies.

723
00:30:55,181 --> 00:30:56,080
I have kids.
You know.

724
00:30:56,081 --> 00:30:58,150
I go to see the incredibles.
Did you see the incredibles?

725
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,290
Not yet.
It's really good.

726
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:02,020
I heard it's really good.
Better than the first one.

727
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:03,580
Is it?
Yeah,

728
00:31:03,581 --> 00:31:04,210
it's really good.

729
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,470
I wanted to see that the other night,
but I got talked into going to see.

730
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:12,620
I call it black purge purge.
What's called the first purge you saw?

731
00:31:15,421 --> 00:31:17,010
Did you see the original part?
Well,

732
00:31:17,011 --> 00:31:19,500
now there's a,
there's a black one and it's supposed to

733
00:31:19,501 --> 00:31:24,501
be the first purge.
Then it tells the origin of how the 

734
00:31:24,501 --> 00:31:25,470
purge a system started in America

735
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:27,380
and it's with black people.

736
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:31,680
I haven't heard of this.
I didn't,

737
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,980
I didn't enjoy it.
I enjoy it.

738
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,830
I enjoy it for many reasons.
Um,

739
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,530
uh,
there was acting problems.

740
00:31:39,531 --> 00:31:41,990
I felt it.
There was acting problems.

741
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:42,650
Uh,
I,

742
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:45,950
I don't know the names of the people 
that I felt the acting bothered me,

743
00:31:45,951 --> 00:31:48,350
but I didn't enjoy that.
And the story.

744
00:31:48,351 --> 00:31:50,810
I just felt like it's one of those ones.
It's like the premise is really good,

745
00:31:50,811 --> 00:31:53,330
but it's just not executed well.
Like the idea of like,

746
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,320
oh shit,
I want to see that.

747
00:31:54,321 --> 00:31:55,670
And then you go see it.
It was a very,

748
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:56,480
it was a let down.

749
00:31:57,030 --> 00:32:02,030
So a candice owens is in the dark place.
Is I just sunk into the sunken place.

750
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:08,480
What do you mean how,
so she's a black chick who's like capen 

751
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:08,530
for trump.
Yeah.

752
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:10,500
What does keeping like rooting for on 
his team?

753
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,390
I've never heard that term.
Reporting.

754
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:14,220
Yeah.
Yeah.

755
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:19,670
So I can't,
I mean by nature I don't understand 

756
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:19,670
that.
And she's a woman.

757
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:22,560
She's a black woman.
You don't understand it.

758
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,280
No,
I don't.

759
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:29,400
What is there to understand like you're 
a womanizer who was also accused of rape

760
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,260
on numerous occasions.
Also been,

761
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:34,530
you know,
as a history of racism from his family.

762
00:32:34,531 --> 00:32:35,850
Like his father,
his father.

763
00:32:35,851 --> 00:32:40,851
You said it in his apartments,
you said deny a renting apartments to 

764
00:32:40,851 --> 00:32:40,851
brown

765
00:32:40,851 --> 00:32:42,680
and black people.
So like that he was raised with that.

766
00:32:42,681 --> 00:32:44,150
So like,
and you know,

767
00:32:44,151 --> 00:32:45,830
calling Mexicans rapists,
like I can't.

768
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:48,470
There's no explanation for supporting.
Yeah.

769
00:32:48,471 --> 00:32:51,020
I think as a black woman she found a 
niche.

770
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,790
She did.
I think that's exactly what it is.

771
00:32:52,791 --> 00:32:57,791
I think that,
I don't even think necessarily she 

772
00:32:57,791 --> 00:32:57,791
believes what she say.
It's like,

773
00:32:57,791 --> 00:32:57,791
I think that she was like,
oh,

774
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,230
this is a way for me to get famous 
because they're how many black she's,

775
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:00,740
you know,
she is.

776
00:33:00,741 --> 00:33:03,110
She's like the brand new Omarosa.
She's like,

777
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:08,470
she's like new Amarosa.
Amarosa was on fear factor back in the 

778
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:08,540
day.
She was,

779
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:13,930
she's crazy.
She accused me of being drunk on the 

780
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:13,930
show.

781
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:14,540
Talking to her.
Well,

782
00:33:14,541 --> 00:33:16,340
she didn't make any sense and so as I 
was saying,

783
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,690
I don't understand what you're saying.
She goes,

784
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:18,530
Joel,
you drunk?

785
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:19,310
And I go,
no.

786
00:33:19,311 --> 00:33:20,390
She goes,
I smell liquor on your breath.

787
00:33:20,391 --> 00:33:21,140
I go,
no,

788
00:33:21,141 --> 00:33:22,700
you don't.
I'm not drunk.

789
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:24,500
I was high as fuck,
but I wasn't drunk.

790
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:26,670
That's so bizarre.
Yeah.

791
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,580
No,
I think she's just was like,

792
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:31,100
Amaros is out of the picture.
I'm a step up.

793
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:33,170
We think so she could be,
honestly,

794
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:36,140
have we ever seen Tomi Lahren and her in
the same room?

795
00:33:36,141 --> 00:33:38,240
Because I think she could be Tomi Lahren
in blackface.

796
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,750
Wow.
That's how I feel.

797
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:40,760
It's rough.
I mean,

798
00:33:40,761 --> 00:33:45,761
what?
I think she needs more than blackface 

799
00:33:45,761 --> 00:33:45,761
and need to change the nose a little 
bit.

800
00:33:45,761 --> 00:33:49,310
There's more it could have been awake.
There's a couple of those girls that are

801
00:33:49,311 --> 00:33:54,311
like interchangeable,
like there's lauren southern and Tomi 

802
00:33:54,311 --> 00:33:54,311
Lahren.
I always get them confused.

803
00:33:54,311 --> 00:33:54,650
Oh yeah,
yeah,

804
00:33:54,651 --> 00:33:55,250
yeah.
You're right.

805
00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:00,760
I don't even.
I honestly don't even know Lauren looks 

806
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:00,760
like they look similar though.
Blond hair.

807
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:04,900
They're both cute blonde conservatives.
There's a market for that.

808
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:07,340
Of course there is because that's not 
the norm.

809
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:09,770
Anything that's outside the norm is 
going to stick out and going to be like,

810
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,030
oh,
this is trendy now.

811
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:16,060
Like this is what our.
This is what are a party now is 

812
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:16,060
represented by,
which is,

813
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,490
you know,
and they're expecting that they're going

814
00:34:17,491 --> 00:34:21,170
to attract a younger demographic.
The millennials and it is.

815
00:34:21,171 --> 00:34:24,110
I mean it's working somewhat.
Well,

816
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,060
it's definitely getting there some 
attention.

817
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:31,470
I know it's,
it's hard to tell what someone really 

818
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:32,820
believes and what they want you to 
believe right toward the toe.

819
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:36,430
Like global warming doesn't make sense.
Wow.

820
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:37,250
That one.

821
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:39,930
See,

822
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:45,300
that is to me when she said that,
that's indicative of someone who's 

823
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,600
trying to follow a line,
like there's a line that you're supposed

824
00:34:46,601 --> 00:34:51,601
to follow if you are a hardcore 
republican supporter and it's like 

825
00:34:51,641 --> 00:34:53,920
industry is good,
big businesses,

826
00:34:53,921 --> 00:34:56,670
good regulation is bad,
you know,

827
00:34:56,890 --> 00:35:01,890
and then the big one is global warming's
a hopes for at least global warming is 

828
00:35:02,621 --> 00:35:06,970
something that's greatly exaggerated by 
these environmentalists in order to fund

829
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:08,740
our Gore's blah,
blah,

830
00:35:08,741 --> 00:35:09,460
blah blah.
You know,

831
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:14,750
just go down these lines where everybody
on the left believes one thing and 

832
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:18,991
everybody know there's certain things 
where you have to believe you're on the 

833
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:18,991
right.

834
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:18,991
Absolutely.
Really,

835
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:20,440
you have to believe you're on the left.
It makes you sound batshit crazy.

836
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,980
Like denying facts.
There's a few of those.

837
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:27,070
Like if you're right wing,
you have to be pro life pretty much.

838
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:27,820
Right?
Very few.

839
00:35:27,821 --> 00:35:29,290
Right.
When people that are pro abortion,

840
00:35:29,291 --> 00:35:31,470
which is why isn't that what happened 
with right?

841
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:32,800
Isn't that what happened with Tomi 
Lahren though?

842
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:36,490
Didn't she lose?
She lost some contracts she had.

843
00:35:36,491 --> 00:35:37,860
It may have been with,
I don't remember,

844
00:35:37,861 --> 00:35:38,070
but

845
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:40,350
because she came out of saying she was 
pro choice,

846
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:42,750
so yeah,
that was the end she suffered.

847
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:49,480
It's interesting when that happens,
like you're not allowed to have varying 

848
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,480
opinions or you know,
it's like an almost cult,

849
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:51,980
like it's very cold.
Like it's,

850
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:53,880
it's definitely a tribe.
I mean,

851
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:55,770
that's,
that's what happens.

852
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:57,540
I haven't watched that and my wife's 
obsessed.

853
00:35:57,690 --> 00:35:58,800
It's,
Oh yeah,

854
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,660
there's a new episode that comes out 
today.

855
00:36:00,661 --> 00:36:02,870
I got to watch it but watch one episode 
and I was like,

856
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:06,420
this is just too fucked up to reel to 
reel.

857
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:12,080
You see the parallels like the kids 
getting separated from their moms and 

858
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:12,630
it's just like,
this is literally happening right now.

859
00:36:12,631 --> 00:36:13,170
It's terrifying.

860
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:18,320
Yeah.
That to me is one of the darker moments 

861
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:18,320
of this,
this era,

862
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:18,810
this,
uh,

863
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:23,850
the knowledge that thousands of kids get
separated from their parents as they 

864
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:23,850
crossed the board.
Like,

865
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:25,980
what,
what the fuck are we doing?

866
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:26,690
Like,
what?

867
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:28,530
And I don't.
There's no excuses.

868
00:36:28,531 --> 00:36:29,230
A lot of people,
I,

869
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:34,260
I'm,
there's a video that I made was just a 

870
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:34,590
rant on the podcast about it with my 
friend Duncan,

871
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:36,960
Duncan trussell.
We've met only a couple of times,

872
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:38,850
but I don't know him very well,
but everyone loves him.

873
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:43,970
So we did this rant or I did this rant 
about it and it got made into a video 

874
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:44,910
and then all these people are like,
you know,

875
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:47,130
you don't understand the real issue on 
the border.

876
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,610
If the real issue in the border 
separating parents when their kids,

877
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,650
that's not the real issue.
Fucking idiot,

878
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:57,710
right?
It's supposed to be keeping criminals 

879
00:36:57,710 --> 00:36:57,710
out.

880
00:36:57,710 --> 00:36:57,710
You think that lady and her baby are 
criminals.

881
00:36:57,710 --> 00:37:00,520
Criminals.
And it's just imagine.

882
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:05,530
I mean,
people can imagine what it'd be like to 

883
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:05,530
live in Mexico,
right next to United States.

884
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:06,160
You're right,
it's right there.

885
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:08,640
You just walk over there and get a job.
You're right there.

886
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,450
And meanwhile,
over here,

887
00:37:09,451 --> 00:37:13,470
you're far better life right over here.
Your cousin got killed by the cartel for

888
00:37:13,471 --> 00:37:15,420
looking at somebody wrong at a taco 
stand.

889
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,260
You know,
and then you just.

890
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:18,240
Nobody,
nobody ever goes to jail for it.

891
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,970
Do you know how many fucking politicians
they killed in Mexico this year?

892
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:22,370
You know the,
the,

893
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:23,970
the number.
Somebody was just telling me.

894
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:24,990
Yeah,
it's more,

895
00:37:24,991 --> 00:37:29,520
it's more than a hundred this year.
Politicians murdered in Mexico.

896
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:31,790
The go to place.
If you're going to murder somebody,

897
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:33,850
right?
Like it's right there and it's.

898
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:36,920
And they never investigated anything 
here.

899
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:41,120
And what's the number of 3,232
politicians killed this year.

900
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:43,610
One hundred and 32.
How do we know this?

901
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:48,720
Mexico goes to the polls this weekend.
One hundred 32 politicians have been 

902
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,250
killed since campaigning began.
Fuck,

903
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:55,450
that is crazy.
Record violence.

904
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:59,710
All because of us.
This is all because of the drug war.

905
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:04,870
If we just made drugs legal,
there would be none of this going on.

906
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:07,180
Yeah.
This is worse than the one Pablo Escobar

907
00:38:07,181 --> 00:38:08,320
was out.
Well,

908
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:10,600
Pablo Escobar,
it's very similar situation.

909
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:12,430
You know,
it's all fueled by drug money.

910
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:13,900
Yeah.
All this is drug money.

911
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,420
I mean,
when you make drugs illegal,

912
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,870
only criminals are selling drugs and 
there's massive amounts of money because

913
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:21,510
people love that cocaine.
Okay?

914
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,960
They do.
Have you ever tried cocaine?

915
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,360
Never,
never made any of them ever.

916
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:27,550
I've tried.
No I won't,

917
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,820
I,
that's what I won't try.

918
00:38:28,821 --> 00:38:33,440
Like I prefer like I've done shrooms and
weed and that's it.

919
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:35,710
How often do you do shrooms?
Often.

920
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:40,980
How often do you do weed?
I don't even like the only way that I 

921
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:41,050
have is given to me like,
you know,

922
00:38:41,051 --> 00:38:46,051
when I'll do light when all judge roast 
battle and they pay you and we'd hear 

923
00:38:46,051 --> 00:38:48,190
the bag of weed and then it takes me 
like years to go through it.

924
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:50,410
That's how.
That's how infrequently.

925
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:52,210
Like I'll smoke when I'm with friends 
but I'm not,

926
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:55,090
I don't drink by myself and I don't like
when I go home.

927
00:38:55,091 --> 00:38:59,560
Like I'd had a bottle of liquor,
a vodka that's been in my freezer over a

928
00:38:59,561 --> 00:39:01,680
year.
Now you're healthy.

929
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:05,430
I'm very healthy and very healthy.
When you smoke weed,

930
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,140
you ever get paranoid?
This one time I did an edible.

931
00:39:08,141 --> 00:39:09,190
I ate too much.
So you know,

932
00:39:09,191 --> 00:39:10,450
Gemara neighbors.
Sure.

933
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:16,150
A very funny comic.
He gave me an edible one time and this 

934
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:19,981
was before,
like anybody could just walk into a 

935
00:39:19,981 --> 00:39:21,871
dispensary because now you just have to 
show your id and you can get anything 

936
00:39:21,871 --> 00:39:25,351
from the dispensary,
but this is when you had to have a a 

937
00:39:25,351 --> 00:39:25,351
card.

938
00:39:25,351 --> 00:39:28,230
So he went in and got it for me and it 
was this lemon bar that said award 

939
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:30,700
winning on it and me being the weed 
novice,

940
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:31,390
I was like,
oh,

941
00:39:31,391 --> 00:39:33,220
this is going to be award winning 
because of the taste.

942
00:39:33,221 --> 00:39:34,440
Right.
It's like probably upset.

943
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:37,450
I was like,
this is like a Paula deen recipe,

944
00:39:37,451 --> 00:39:42,451
and so I ate like half of it and I was 
by myself and I woke up.

945
00:39:46,031 --> 00:39:48,640
I was laying down and I was in my bed 
and I sat up and I said,

946
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:50,740
am I talking to myself?
I'm not talking to myself.

947
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:52,180
Oh my God,
I am talking to myself.

948
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:55,840
I'm not talking to myself.
I and I was saying this out loud.

949
00:39:56,250 --> 00:40:01,250
I have to check.
I went on my phone to get on twitter to 

950
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:03,871
see the,
make sure the world was still happening 

951
00:40:03,871 --> 00:40:03,871
because I was like,
I,

952
00:40:03,871 --> 00:40:04,150
I felt like I was in some weird twilight
zone.

953
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:09,740
It was awful.
So I got on there and then I made my 

954
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:09,740
forced myself to go to sleep because I 
was like,

955
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,710
I can't be awake like this.
So I forced myself to go to sleep.

956
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:16,980
I woke up the next morning,
I was still high for like five more 

957
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:16,980
hours.

958
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:20,710
It was awful.

959
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:25,970
Yeah.
I gave my friend and edible and he 

960
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:25,970
called me up a day later,
said I'm still high

961
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:28,610
a day later if you don't know what 
you're doing with it,

962
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:30,410
because I had a conversation with 
someone else the other day and they were

963
00:40:30,411 --> 00:40:31,250
like,
I ate there,

964
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:33,230
I for Rice Krispie treats and I was 
like,

965
00:40:33,231 --> 00:40:38,231
why would you eat four of them?
He called the cops the cops and then 

966
00:40:39,051 --> 00:40:41,270
checked himself,
went to a hospital because he thought he

967
00:40:41,271 --> 00:40:41,870
was dying.

968
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:45,000
Do you ever see the one where it was a 
nine slash 11 call?

969
00:40:45,001 --> 00:40:50,001
The cops took weed from these people.
They pulled them over and then the cops 

970
00:40:50,001 --> 00:40:53,631
use the weed to make pot brownies and 
then they ate the pot brownies and they 

971
00:40:53,631 --> 00:40:56,070
called nine one on themselves.
They called for an ambulance.

972
00:40:56,071 --> 00:41:01,071
He said there were dying.
Please send help times moving very 

973
00:41:01,071 --> 00:41:04,371
slowly,
but what's hilarious is it's a fucking 

974
00:41:04,371 --> 00:41:07,281
nine one,
one call from a cop from a cop and the 

975
00:41:07,281 --> 00:41:10,371
cop is calling to get an ambulance.
Can you say the time is moving slowly 

976
00:41:10,371 --> 00:41:13,020
and they stole the weed from these 
fucking kids and they pulled over.

977
00:41:13,021 --> 00:41:15,300
The whole thing is just.
It's brilliant.

978
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:16,800
It's so funny.

979
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:19,050
Oh Man.

980
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:22,090
It's one of my all time favorite.
Nine slash 11 calls because it's just so

981
00:41:22,091 --> 00:41:23,240
sad.
Yeah,

982
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,310
yeah,
yeah.

983
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:30,260
Can you.
Can you please send help times moving 

984
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:30,260
very slowly.
Want to play it?

985
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:33,620
I was looking up an article about it.
The cop had to.

986
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:34,160
He

987
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:39,050
resigned before he got in trouble for.
He resigned taking the weed and be using

988
00:41:39,051 --> 00:41:40,400
it,
so he quit.

989
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:42,170
Yeah,
that's probably a good move.

990
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:44,600
At that point you kind of have to.
Yeah.

991
00:41:44,601 --> 00:41:47,630
He called nine slash 11 and we're 
talking about on a podcast years later,

992
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:51,680
everybody's heard that you'd never that 
fucking a guarantee.

993
00:41:51,681 --> 00:41:54,320
The video is probably been played a 
million times.

994
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:56,600
Easily.
More than a million.

995
00:41:57,470 --> 00:42:00,290
Do you have Jamie?
I've found this a shorter version.

996
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:01,700
Okay.
Listen to this.

997
00:42:01,701 --> 00:42:06,110
Poor fucked.
Just think about this to save

998
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,590
marijuana.
If they had something in it.

999
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:19,100
I think we're dying.
We made brownies and I think we're that 

1000
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:22,100
glow

1001
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,370
lady.
Laughing.

1002
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:31,520
See,
pot is something that even when you're 

1003
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,010
having an overdose,
people laugh at you because nobody dies,

1004
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:35,850
dies and she's on the news.
Those are the stiffest fucking people on

1005
00:42:35,851 --> 00:42:40,851
the planet.
You ever meet a real newscaster in real 

1006
00:42:40,851 --> 00:42:44,451
life once they walk around like this?
Once they walk around like robots.

1007
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:46,110
Robots.
Yeah.

1008
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:46,920
They're like,
hello,

1009
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,560
how are you?
Oh,

1010
00:42:49,561 --> 00:42:50,750
that's great.
That's wonderful.

1011
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:52,350
They're always scared to say something 
wrong.

1012
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:56,100
It's interesting like because it's,
we're all kind of in the,

1013
00:42:56,101 --> 00:42:58,740
you know,
that's considered entertainment.

1014
00:42:58,741 --> 00:42:59,760
You know,
they're on television,

1015
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:02,670
they're camera.
Do not entertainers.

1016
00:43:02,671 --> 00:43:06,240
They just readers is.
What it is is like people who don't have

1017
00:43:06,241 --> 00:43:08,580
enough personality to have zero 
personality,

1018
00:43:08,581 --> 00:43:13,581
that's the whole thing.
If you have any personality to kick you 

1019
00:43:13,581 --> 00:43:13,590
off the air,
the only thing you can have is you could

1020
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:18,591
be one of those weather girls with a big
ass got fat boobs too.

1021
00:43:19,501 --> 00:43:24,501
It's not just the assets to everything.
I noticed that that was the first thing 

1022
00:43:24,501 --> 00:43:26,991
when I moved out to la.
That was one of the first thing I think 

1023
00:43:26,991 --> 00:43:28,740
that I noticed what the La,
whether people or the weather women.

1024
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,420
I was like,
they are hot.

1025
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:32,310
Hot as fuck this.
Back in Cincinnati,

1026
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:35,520
high heels.
Short skirts,

1027
00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:38,430
talking about tornadoes and shit.
Kicking their ass out.

1028
00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:40,440
Point to weather patterns.

1029
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:45,270
Yeah.
This one I think South America,

1030
00:43:45,271 --> 00:43:47,820
there's one famous lady,
she's like a famous weather cast.

1031
00:43:47,830 --> 00:43:49,530
She's like one of the hottest women on 
the planet.

1032
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:51,330
Tiny little waist,
giant ass,

1033
00:43:51,331 --> 00:43:54,790
big tits.
Whereas a waist trainer mate.

1034
00:43:54,850 --> 00:43:56,220
What are you hating on her?
Yeah,

1035
00:43:56,221 --> 00:43:58,910
because I hate waist trainers.
Bobby Lee bought me one,

1036
00:44:01,290 --> 00:44:06,290
but you'll waste training.
He takes me on the road with him 

1037
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:08,991
sometimes and willing.
One time we were in like a cvs and I 

1038
00:44:08,991 --> 00:44:08,991
jokingly picked it up and I was like,
bobby,

1039
00:44:08,991 --> 00:44:10,740
buy me this,
and he did and it was like $13,

1040
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:12,390
but no,
I still have it.

1041
00:44:12,391 --> 00:44:13,920
I never tried it.
But they're terrifying.

1042
00:44:13,921 --> 00:44:18,921
They like their corsets.
I've read articles that you see you're 

1043
00:44:18,921 --> 00:44:20,070
not supposed to wear these things 
because it binds.

1044
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:25,100
It's bad for your organs,
your organs around the Kardashians wear 

1045
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:25,440
them.
But yeah,

1046
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:30,920
so that's why I'm like,
I'm not gonna be happy and promote that 

1047
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:30,920
for women,
hurting ourselves.

1048
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,200
So what's

1049
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:36,270
a weird thick waste than have a kidney 
in my neck.

1050
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:37,720
They go,
yeah,

1051
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:41,370
just like a farm worker waste.
Yeah.

1052
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,590
Well not to pick things up.
Calm down.

1053
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:45,810
That carries.
Hey,

1054
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:46,840
I do have,
I have an.

1055
00:44:46,841 --> 00:44:49,540
I'm like an athletic build so I don't 
have a tiny waist.

1056
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:50,980
Does it bother you?
No,

1057
00:44:50,981 --> 00:44:53,290
it doesn't bother me.
I like my body.

1058
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:54,660
You should.
Is.

1059
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:56,320
It looks great.
You look great.

1060
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:59,660
Thanks Jesus.
Conversation.

1061
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:02,260
I never get into it guys.
I like my body like,

1062
00:45:02,261 --> 00:45:02,920
dude,
you look good.

1063
00:45:03,010 --> 00:45:06,230
Tell me you like my body just bro.
I'm good bro.

1064
00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:09,240
My okay,
I got it.

1065
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:12,280
Kind of a thick waste.
I do.

1066
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:14,280
I broke.
I'm allowed to say have a thick ways.

1067
00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:16,990
You're not going to say it.
I can say it.

1068
00:45:16,991 --> 00:45:19,630
You can't say it growing up thick 
thighs,

1069
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:20,860
a thick ass,

1070
00:45:20,910 --> 00:45:24,510
but even so like women,
we can say that and we know that men,

1071
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:29,630
some men are a lot of men like it,
but being called fic does net never 

1072
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:34,011
makes us feel good about ourselves.
Even if even if we know that men like 

1073
00:45:34,321 --> 00:45:36,090
it,
it still makes it the back of our head.

1074
00:45:36,091 --> 00:45:36,270
We're like,

1075
00:45:36,290 --> 00:45:37,850
what does he mean?
I'm fat?

1076
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:40,700
What's all this?
We should have guaranteed this girls out

1077
00:45:40,701 --> 00:45:42,650
there that like being thick.
Yeah,

1078
00:45:42,651 --> 00:45:44,630
of course,
of course,

1079
00:45:44,690 --> 00:45:45,290
of course,

1080
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:50,900
but a lot of women when they know.
I've had conversations with other women 

1081
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:50,900
that had been like,
oh look,

1082
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:52,230
I used to be.
When I was in high school,

1083
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:57,380
I was probably 20,
25 pounds heavier than what I am right 

1084
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:58,230
now.
Lots of carbs,

1085
00:45:58,530 --> 00:45:59,360
lots of carbs,
lot.

1086
00:45:59,370 --> 00:46:01,620
I didn't know how to eat properly 
because.

1087
00:46:01,830 --> 00:46:06,830
So there was a whole low fat craze.
You remember this when snackwells was 

1088
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:08,110
popping,
you remember that and they,

1089
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:09,300
they were like,
no,

1090
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:10,860
no,
fat,

1091
00:46:10,890 --> 00:46:15,890
high fat is bad.
So they started doing low fat 

1092
00:46:15,890 --> 00:46:18,171
everything,
but then they replaced the fat with 

1093
00:46:18,171 --> 00:46:18,171
sugar so it would taste palatable,
you know,

1094
00:46:18,171 --> 00:46:19,170
because if you take the fat out,
the flavors going,

1095
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:21,870
so like how do we get the flavor back?
So they put a bunch of sugar and stuff.

1096
00:46:21,871 --> 00:46:24,480
So you're eating like thinking,
oh it's low fat.

1097
00:46:24,690 --> 00:46:28,110
I would come home and he'd like a bag of
like low fat pretzels,

1098
00:46:28,111 --> 00:46:31,290
things like a bag of those snyder's of 
Hanover.

1099
00:46:31,610 --> 00:46:34,560
Brett's a bag,
one of those big ones and be like,

1100
00:46:34,561 --> 00:46:36,690
why am I gaining weight?
Because I didn't know.

1101
00:46:36,691 --> 00:46:38,760
I thought low fat man.
Oh I would.

1102
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:39,510
It's low fat,

1103
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:42,310
no fat.
There's so much of that.

1104
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:45,580
There's so many of those low fat items 
that are way worse for you.

1105
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:46,410
Yeah.
I don't even know.

1106
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,150
I mean are people.
I don't even think that's a thing.

1107
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:50,340
Now it's gluten free.
Gluten free is what's,

1108
00:46:50,430 --> 00:46:52,120
what's popular.
Gluten free.

1109
00:46:52,121 --> 00:46:52,440
And

1110
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:59,270
what's the other thing?
I can't think there's another thing 

1111
00:46:59,270 --> 00:47:02,691
that's kind of trending right now,
but it's not just not just gluten 

1112
00:47:02,691 --> 00:47:02,691
ketogenic diets.
Is that what you're talking about?

1113
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:06,470
No,
I don't know what I'm thinking about.

1114
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:08,870
I literally had a brain fart,
but there is something else.

1115
00:47:08,930 --> 00:47:11,960
Maybe Paleo,
a new trendy thing.

1116
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:16,980
Yeah,
but it's all like nobody knows what the 

1117
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:16,980
repercussions of any of these things 
are.

1118
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:20,681
Like Paleo might be good for temporary,
but in the longterm we don't know the 

1119
00:47:20,681 --> 00:47:20,681
damage is going to be doing

1120
00:47:20,681 --> 00:47:22,100
well.
Paleo is real simple.

1121
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,830
It's not going to do any damage.
Paleo is just real food.

1122
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,740
Paleo just means no grain and no rice.
That's all it means.

1123
00:47:28,070 --> 00:47:29,300
It just.
No preservatives,

1124
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,290
artificial flavors,
no artificial colors,

1125
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:33,550
just meat,
chicken,

1126
00:47:33,551 --> 00:47:34,600
fish,
vegetables,

1127
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:35,320
meat,
chicken,

1128
00:47:35,321 --> 00:47:36,160
fish,
vegetables.

1129
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:38,130
There's nothing wrong with that.
There's not the.

1130
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:41,080
You don't have to worry about that trend
like this.

1131
00:47:41,110 --> 00:47:43,850
Is this going to be able to go like the 
low fat trend does.

1132
00:47:43,870 --> 00:47:46,840
That's a normal thing for people to eat.
You said fruits to you.

1133
00:47:46,841 --> 00:47:49,090
They can do fruits,
fruits.

1134
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:51,520
Look,
this people that eat carnivore diet,

1135
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:54,160
this is the more most recent one where 
they only eat meat.

1136
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:55,940
That's it.
No,

1137
00:47:56,590 --> 00:47:57,370
no,
no.

1138
00:47:57,371 --> 00:47:59,680
That's not good.
How do you know that's not good?

1139
00:48:00,070 --> 00:48:03,880
I have a friend with pretty severe 
autoimmune disease and it's gone because

1140
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:08,881
of eating only carnivore diet.
His daughter had her hip replaced and 

1141
00:48:08,881 --> 00:48:08,881
her ankle replaced.

1142
00:48:08,881 --> 00:48:11,470
She has terrible arthritis with 
carnivore diet gone.

1143
00:48:11,530 --> 00:48:15,160
Some people have a really adverse 
reaction to carbohydrates,

1144
00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:16,840
fruits and vegetables.
Nope.

1145
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:22,380
Nope.
He's not eating anything and he's been 

1146
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:22,380
doing.
He's a professor.

1147
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:22,600
Yeah.
Brilliant guy.

1148
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:25,450
What's his cholesterol look like?
That's the thing.

1149
00:48:25,451 --> 00:48:27,190
See you.
People say things like that,

1150
00:48:27,191 --> 00:48:28,030
like you just said,
that.

1151
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:33,240
That's not where cholesterol comes from.
Dietary cholesterol doesn't have any 

1152
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:34,900
impact on blood lipids.
It doesn't have any impact on your blood

1153
00:48:34,901 --> 00:48:39,901
cholesterol.
This is where cholesterol is bad when 

1154
00:48:39,901 --> 00:48:40,630
you have cholesterol and high 
carbohydrates,

1155
00:48:40,930 --> 00:48:44,380
because when your body is burning a lot 
of carbohydrates,

1156
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:49,680
your body is in fat storing mode,
so if you eat a bunch of fat and 

1157
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,280
carbohydrates,
you're asking me get fat as fuck,

1158
00:48:51,550 --> 00:48:54,160
but if you do just that,
but if you adjust the famil fat,

1159
00:48:54,490 --> 00:48:56,470
then your body loses weight.
Believe it or not,

1160
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:57,610
you actually get slim.

1161
00:48:57,940 --> 00:48:58,290
Yeah,
no,

1162
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:00,850
I know about that part,
but I didn't know the cholesterol part.

1163
00:49:00,910 --> 00:49:01,870
Yeah,
you're not.

1164
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:06,900
If you are.
This is one the important thing for 

1165
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:06,900
people.
If you are on a high fat,

1166
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:11,551
low carb diet,
you cannot eat large amounts of 

1167
00:49:11,551 --> 00:49:14,131
carbohydrates because if you do,
it's just going to go right to fat 

1168
00:49:14,131 --> 00:49:15,880
because your body just is not.
Your body's going to use what's going to

1169
00:49:15,910 --> 00:49:20,910
burn carbohydrates and it's going to 
take all the fat you take in and just 

1170
00:49:20,910 --> 00:49:22,330
store it so you just going to get fat as
fuck.

1171
00:49:23,650 --> 00:49:25,300
Well,
without this body positivity,

1172
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:27,490
that's how do you know that's not what I
want.

1173
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,050
That you want to get fat,
do you think?

1174
00:49:30,051 --> 00:49:32,150
So that can be body positive,
body positive.

1175
00:49:32,151 --> 00:49:32,830
Is that what that is?

1176
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:37,750
It's just embraced the fatness.
It's literally just being like if you're

1177
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:39,280
fat,
love your body and that's fine.

1178
00:49:39,281 --> 00:49:42,340
Like you can be fat and love your body,
but it's also promoting,

1179
00:49:42,341 --> 00:49:43,900
you know,
unhealthy behaviors.

1180
00:49:43,930 --> 00:49:48,930
I think also,
and we want to distinguish between the 

1181
00:49:48,930 --> 00:49:48,930
two.

1182
00:49:48,930 --> 00:49:51,690
Well,
we want to give people a free pass by 

1183
00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:51,690
saying be body positive.
You know,

1184
00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:52,090
don't,
don't fat shame,

1185
00:49:52,310 --> 00:49:54,970
right?
Like leave people be I have a black belt

1186
00:49:54,971 --> 00:49:56,260
and fat shaming or are you good at it?

1187
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:01,380
You know,
you do taekwondo Id fat shame.

1188
00:50:01,470 --> 00:50:02,890
No.
Go to a Dojo.

1189
00:50:04,910 --> 00:50:06,250
Fat,
stinky armpits.

1190
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:10,900
It used to be easy to fat.
Shame.

1191
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:13,030
Now people are super upset about it.
Yeah.

1192
00:50:13,031 --> 00:50:13,660
No,
I know.

1193
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:15,760
I'm not sure it was right.
I'm really not.

1194
00:50:16,170 --> 00:50:21,170
Well it's not right,
but I mean you should make fun of 

1195
00:50:21,170 --> 00:50:21,170
somebody for the way they look.
You know?

1196
00:50:21,170 --> 00:50:25,071
I don't think that's right,
but we shouldn't be promoting an 

1197
00:50:25,071 --> 00:50:25,071
unhealthy lifestyle.

1198
00:50:25,071 --> 00:50:29,730
That too.
And also by Tom Secura said that like 

1199
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:30,650
people making fun of his weight is a 
reason why he lost weight.

1200
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:32,930
He was like fat shaming was very 
effective on me.

1201
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:35,450
He lost the weight because people were 
fat shaming.

1202
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:37,950
Yeah.
A lot of behaviors.

1203
00:50:38,190 --> 00:50:40,870
A lot of behaviors or because you felt 
shame and we're in.

1204
00:50:41,130 --> 00:50:44,400
We're in a society where like,
there is no shame anymore.

1205
00:50:44,770 --> 00:50:46,140
There's no shame with anything.
I know.

1206
00:50:46,350 --> 00:50:50,730
I know people that are like proud of 
their alcoholism.

1207
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:54,860
I've heard people bragging about Duis.
What?

1208
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:59,960
I'm not kidding.
Hanging around with the wrong people or 

1209
00:50:59,960 --> 00:50:59,960
they're not my friends.
I just,

1210
00:50:59,960 --> 00:50:59,960
I've heard it.

1211
00:51:00,990 --> 00:51:03,390
So do you think that that's an escape 
clause?

1212
00:51:03,391 --> 00:51:04,260
Like they're just,
like,

1213
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:07,710
they're giving themselves an out.
Like I love being an alcoholic.

1214
00:51:07,711 --> 00:51:08,160
Fuck it.

1215
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:13,340
Yeah.
I think to them it's because of we're 

1216
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:13,340
accepting everything now that it's just 
like,

1217
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:13,340
it's,
it's,

1218
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:14,550
uh,
it's just fun behavior.

1219
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:17,040
Like I'm fun when I'm drunk and it's 
just.

1220
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,110
And that's fine.
You can be fun.

1221
00:51:19,111 --> 00:51:20,070
But also,
you know,

1222
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:24,150
there's Uber's take a lyft.
Why are you driving?

1223
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:25,560
That's the problem.
Yeah.

1224
00:51:25,610 --> 00:51:28,010
The especially today,
there's no excuse for that,

1225
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:30,830
especially in Hollywood.
I mean that fucking comedy store parking

1226
00:51:30,831 --> 00:51:35,831
lot,
you can't get out of it because it's 

1227
00:51:35,831 --> 00:51:35,831
always jammed up.
The lifts and Hoover's.

1228
00:51:35,831 --> 00:51:35,831
Yep.
Which is great,

1229
00:51:35,831 --> 00:51:36,260
but also it is annoying.
It's annoying.

1230
00:51:36,261 --> 00:51:41,261
It's annoying,
but it's great that people are taking 

1231
00:51:41,261 --> 00:51:43,430
responsibility to drive them around.
The whole thing about Uber says like how

1232
00:51:43,431 --> 00:51:45,740
much background check and they do it on 
those freaks.

1233
00:51:45,850 --> 00:51:46,420
Yeah,
no,

1234
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:51,660
I'm,
I'm positive I've gotten into a lyft 

1235
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:51,660
driver or uber driver because I don't,
I don't.

1236
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:54,390
I used to do uber and then they suck,
so I started doing lyft,

1237
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:59,400
but yeah,
I'm sure I got an uber at one point 

1238
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:00,970
where somebody was drunker than I am,
but maybe let me get this.

1239
00:52:01,570 --> 00:52:02,950
Yeah,
they're not checking them right?

1240
00:52:03,010 --> 00:52:03,850
No,
not at all.

1241
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:06,220
Not at all.
I just,

1242
00:52:06,221 --> 00:52:07,750
I don't know.
I feel like being.

1243
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:10,300
Because you don't drink at all to you or
do you do?

1244
00:52:11,950 --> 00:52:16,950
I just feel like I have such a 
nonaddictive a personality and I feel 

1245
00:52:16,950 --> 00:52:21,721
that most people are addicted to things 
and that's why it's also tough for me,

1246
00:52:22,571 --> 00:52:26,680
like a dating also.
It's because I know I'd see.

1247
00:52:26,681 --> 00:52:29,150
I know that a lot of people that I have,
you know,

1248
00:52:29,230 --> 00:52:30,790
been on dates with or whatever.
It's like,

1249
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:35,820
oh,
this lifestyle is not conducive to what 

1250
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:36,070
I'm trying to do.
So we just don't click in that way

1251
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,700
because you find you go on dates with 
guys are getting fucked up.

1252
00:52:38,950 --> 00:52:39,940
Yeah,
like a lot,

1253
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:40,930
a lot,
a lot.

1254
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:42,620
So much so.
UHM,

1255
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:44,900
weekend nights.
Yeah.

1256
00:52:45,010 --> 00:52:46,020
Weeknights.
Yeah.

1257
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:47,260
Any day.
Is it Tuesday?

1258
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:49,120
Why am I not drunk yet?
Right.

1259
00:52:49,930 --> 00:52:50,860
So yeah,
I actually,

1260
00:52:50,861 --> 00:52:53,620
the last APP that I got on with like a,
it's a,

1261
00:52:53,621 --> 00:52:58,621
it's called meet mindful because I 
wanted to find people who were viewed as

1262
00:53:00,190 --> 00:53:05,190
somebody who is just more present and 
maybe likes themself a little bit more 

1263
00:53:05,190 --> 00:53:07,480
so they don't have to get drunk all the 
time to be with themselves.

1264
00:53:07,570 --> 00:53:08,680
Yeah.
How'd that work out?

1265
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:10,000
Well,
they were like,

1266
00:53:10,001 --> 00:53:13,210
you got to pay $30 a month.
And I was like,

1267
00:53:13,211 --> 00:53:14,560
maybe I'm not looking for love right 
now.

1268
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:17,950
I paid,
I paid before for like eharmony.

1269
00:53:18,010 --> 00:53:20,410
That's what I paid for that one.
I paid almost $200 for that one.

1270
00:53:20,470 --> 00:53:21,910
How would that work out?
Terribly.

1271
00:53:22,030 --> 00:53:24,370
And that's why I'm hesitant to pay again
because I got nothing.

1272
00:53:24,371 --> 00:53:25,980
I got literally nothing

1273
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:27,090
from that.
So I'm like,

1274
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:29,210
I feel like one sentence,
I thought Ian Harmony,

1275
00:53:29,211 --> 00:53:34,211
like instantly find the love of your 
dreams and then you sit down with them 

1276
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:34,211
on a couch.
They do a video with you,

1277
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:34,740
Joe.
I knew.

1278
00:53:34,741 --> 00:53:37,860
Then as soon as I met candice,
she was the one.

1279
00:53:38,490 --> 00:53:43,490
I was on there for over a year.
What I called customer service and 

1280
00:53:43,490 --> 00:53:43,530
complained.
What'd you say?

1281
00:53:43,950 --> 00:53:48,950
Where's my deck?
You Promise Me Dick by month three or I 

1282
00:53:51,841 --> 00:53:53,220
get a refund.
Yeah,

1283
00:53:53,221 --> 00:53:58,221
no.
I called and I said I would like a 

1284
00:53:58,221 --> 00:53:58,221
refund.
Plus like why?

1285
00:53:58,221 --> 00:53:59,070
And I said,
these dudes are like,

1286
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:03,390
for like all of them and below they were
just,

1287
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:06,210
all of them were like the worst looking 
people I'd ever seen.

1288
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:11,600
And she was like,
we have so many messages that you 

1289
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:11,600
haven't responded to.
I said,

1290
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:15,111
did you not hear my first complaint?
Like I'm not going to respond to any of 

1291
00:54:15,111 --> 00:54:16,770
these dudes.
They were terrible looking and not just,

1292
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,930
not just like physically,
but just like the photo,

1293
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:22,470
like terrifying looking like serial 
killers,

1294
00:54:22,490 --> 00:54:25,930
like don't know pictures of just a 
foreheads.

1295
00:54:27,970 --> 00:54:31,670
I take a picture properly.
The dating APP world.

1296
00:54:31,671 --> 00:54:33,600
It's got to be fucking weird.
I'm so lucky.

1297
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:36,200
I know several people that are in the 
dating app world.

1298
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:37,550
If so,
tell me about it.

1299
00:54:37,790 --> 00:54:39,920
Or swiping right.
Swiping left.

1300
00:54:40,030 --> 00:54:41,330
Pull.
It's awful.

1301
00:54:41,331 --> 00:54:42,920
Which one do you swipe right if you like
them.

1302
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:44,180
Which one do you say?
Swipe White,

1303
00:54:44,370 --> 00:54:44,730
right?

1304
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:49,000
Mother?
How dare he?

1305
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:54,250
When there was a phase where I was 
swiping white didn't work out.

1306
00:54:54,730 --> 00:54:55,320
No,
I've,

1307
00:54:55,340 --> 00:54:57,310
I've only.
I've dated a couple of white dudes in my

1308
00:54:57,311 --> 00:54:58,510
life.
Barely.

1309
00:54:58,570 --> 00:55:01,760
Barely.
Just one of them I think was gay and now

1310
00:55:01,830 --> 00:55:04,780
the another one.
Pathological Liar.

1311
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:06,400
I've made it to gigs.

1312
00:55:06,490 --> 00:55:07,600
Gay dudes.
I think so.

1313
00:55:07,601 --> 00:55:12,601
Out of your study group,
white people are gay and pathological 

1314
00:55:12,601 --> 00:55:12,601
liars.
Yes.

1315
00:55:12,601 --> 00:55:14,900
And that's it.
There's nothing else.

1316
00:55:17,110 --> 00:55:18,770
Oh,
the two are not mutually exclusive.

1317
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:21,380
You can be gay in a pathological liar.
You're not even sure.

1318
00:55:21,470 --> 00:55:24,020
I'm sure it's possible to have that 
combination.

1319
00:55:26,390 --> 00:55:27,740
Just sent me up with one of your 
friends.

1320
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:28,190
Okay.

1321
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:30,010
I'll try to find somebody for you.
Yeah,

1322
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:33,690
I'll try to find somebody.
Why not a.

1323
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:35,900
not a like MMA person.
Oh,

1324
00:55:35,901 --> 00:55:36,410
you don't want.
Well,

1325
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:38,870
how come?
I don't think I could handle that.

1326
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:41,960
It's a lot of muscles.
Muscles.

1327
00:55:41,990 --> 00:55:45,460
Not that much.
Like what do you want to do the work.

1328
00:55:45,461 --> 00:55:46,190
So like once a week,

1329
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:51,620
maybe twice,
maybe twice,

1330
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:52,730
maybe twice.
Twice.

1331
00:55:52,731 --> 00:55:57,731
But it doesn't get crazy and go crazy.
No one who gets up in the morning and 

1332
00:55:57,731 --> 00:56:00,230
runs early mean I can do that.
I'll be meditating while he was running.

1333
00:56:00,231 --> 00:56:00,860
Running,
running.

1334
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:02,060
So that's fine.
That'll work out.

1335
00:56:02,270 --> 00:56:03,050
Yeah.
Yeah.

1336
00:56:03,051 --> 00:56:05,750
But I just don't want someone who like 
might be on steroids,

1337
00:56:06,710 --> 00:56:07,790
might be,
might be.

1338
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:10,360
Might be.
Okay.

1339
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:13,190
I'll keep it in mind.
It's got to be hard.

1340
00:56:13,191 --> 00:56:14,960
Like when you fill out one of them,
eat harmony things.

1341
00:56:14,961 --> 00:56:17,170
What do you have to write?
You write what your occupation is,

1342
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:18,620
what you're looking for.
What do you write?

1343
00:56:18,621 --> 00:56:20,150
What you looking for?
Do you ever ride?

1344
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:22,900
I'm just looking for Dick.
No direct.

1345
00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:27,940
I'm looking for a meaningful 
relationship with the person of my 

1346
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:30,031
dreams.
Women already have to swat the dicks 

1347
00:56:30,031 --> 00:56:30,031
away without writing.
I'm looking for Dick.

1348
00:56:30,031 --> 00:56:31,120
Swat is Dixie.

1349
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:32,230
Walk outside and it's.
Hey,

1350
00:56:32,570 --> 00:56:33,660
get out.
Dick's.

1351
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:35,830
Nope.
So yeah,

1352
00:56:35,831 --> 00:56:37,330
no,
you can't write that in.

1353
00:56:37,331 --> 00:56:38,680
If I wanted that,
I'd be on tinder.

1354
00:56:38,710 --> 00:56:40,000
You know,
those tended to move.

1355
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:41,980
She would just want some Dick.
You're so lucky.

1356
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:45,040
You don't know about any of this.
Tinder is the Dick App.

1357
00:56:45,270 --> 00:56:50,270
That's it.
So if you just want some Dick and even 

1358
00:56:50,270 --> 00:56:53,230
bumble is kind of turning into that,
do you think that bumble is a new one in

1359
00:56:53,231 --> 00:56:56,050
not new anymore?
A newer one is coffee meets Bagel.

1360
00:56:56,051 --> 00:57:01,051
I was on that one for a minute.
I was reading this thing that said that 

1361
00:57:01,051 --> 00:57:03,781
there's a car.
This was made me angry that it said his 

1362
00:57:03,781 --> 00:57:07,711
tinder and Grindr.
Are they responsible in any way for the 

1363
00:57:07,711 --> 00:57:09,430
spread of stds from their apps?
Of course.

1364
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:10,540
No,
they're not.

1365
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:13,280
Of course they don't,
they don't owe a goddamn thing.

1366
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:17,080
You can't be in their dicks and they 
absolutely like they're not,

1367
00:57:17,081 --> 00:57:17,350
they're not.

1368
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:19,030
They shouldn't be sued,
like that's ridiculous.

1369
00:57:19,031 --> 00:57:20,200
But were saying,
should they,

1370
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:22,630
should they take responsibility?
Take responsibility.

1371
00:57:22,631 --> 00:57:27,631
No,
but I guarantee that more people are 

1372
00:57:27,631 --> 00:57:27,631
hooking up because of this things,
right?

1373
00:57:27,631 --> 00:57:29,440
These,
these apps and doing it unsafely.

1374
00:57:30,070 --> 00:57:33,160
So what,
that's not an any skin off their back.

1375
00:57:33,470 --> 00:57:34,540
No,
no,

1376
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:35,510
I know.
I'm just,

1377
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:38,530
it's a weird time where like people 
getting in trouble for things that other

1378
00:57:38,531 --> 00:57:39,370
people are doing.
Yeah,

1379
00:57:39,371 --> 00:57:41,160
absolutely.
You want people to be responsible.

1380
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:43,210
It's taking personal responsibility for 
their own mistakes.

1381
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:43,540
Like,
yeah,

1382
00:57:43,570 --> 00:57:45,030
put a condom on.
What are you talking about when you did?

1383
00:57:45,290 --> 00:57:47,180
Yeah,
I've heard stories about like,

1384
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:47,890
hey dudes,
man,

1385
00:57:47,910 --> 00:57:49,130
they're so trifling.
Look,

1386
00:57:50,610 --> 00:57:55,610
my friend is a gay dude,
was telling me about what the behavior 

1387
00:57:55,610 --> 00:57:55,610
and gay,
uh,

1388
00:57:55,610 --> 00:57:59,940
in gay gyms,
how like they have in the shower,

1389
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:05,070
there's a signal so that if you,
if you want somebody to come up in there

1390
00:58:05,071 --> 00:58:10,071
and just ram you and you leave the 
curtain partially opened and that's kind

1391
00:58:10,441 --> 00:58:12,450
of like a signal to be like,
okay,

1392
00:58:12,451 --> 00:58:14,490
if you want to come up in here and get 
some you can.

1393
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:15,930
And I was talking to a friend,
I'm like,

1394
00:58:15,931 --> 00:58:20,931
what if you didn't know that rule and 
you accidentally leave the curtain open 

1395
00:58:20,931 --> 00:58:22,230
just because you didn't close it 
properly.

1396
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:24,140
Jesus.
And all of a sudden some dude is

1397
00:58:25,490 --> 00:58:29,530
every time I've been in gyms around gay 
people or gay,

1398
00:58:29,950 --> 00:58:33,200
I used to belong to Gold's gym on Korea.
It's a in,

1399
00:58:33,201 --> 00:58:34,190
you know,
in West Hollywood.

1400
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:38,430
And that's where we used to film 
newsradio right down the street from.

1401
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:40,370
Oh yeah.
So that was the gym that I worked out.

1402
00:58:40,371 --> 00:58:43,490
It's a gay disco that Jim is a God damn 
gay disco.

1403
00:58:44,210 --> 00:58:46,430
And when I would go there,
not that it's anything wrong with that,

1404
00:58:46,431 --> 00:58:48,650
but when I would go there,
it was.

1405
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:52,750
You would get that feeling.
That girl gets all the time.

1406
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:54,380
Terrified.
Well yeah.

1407
00:58:54,381 --> 00:58:55,970
That's something.
All these eyes on me,

1408
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,950
someone's trying to fuck you go unsafe 
right now.

1409
00:58:57,990 --> 00:58:59,870
Yeah.
It's a different feel like girls hitting

1410
00:58:59,871 --> 00:59:04,871
on use.
Like if you want you can come over here 

1411
00:59:04,871 --> 00:59:07,180
guys,
if you want to come over there because 

1412
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:07,580
it's a different feeling like Michael 
Jackson,

1413
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:10,790
Michael Jackson when he's not using his 
falsetto voice.

1414
00:59:12,170 --> 00:59:15,200
But it's an uncomfortable feeling 
knowing that guys want to fuck you.

1415
00:59:15,380 --> 00:59:20,380
Like I couldn't imagine being a girl.
Just trying to navigate my way through 

1416
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:20,380
dudes.
It's terrifying.

1417
00:59:20,450 --> 00:59:23,090
Swat and Dick's swot and them platinum.
Yeah.

1418
00:59:23,091 --> 00:59:25,520
No crack.
Kevin Peeping Toms at your windows.

1419
00:59:25,521 --> 00:59:25,920
It's,
it's,

1420
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:27,500
it's a scary world out there.

1421
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:33,500
So your neighbor,
when they found that guy,

1422
00:59:33,501 --> 00:59:35,460
was he hot out?
No,

1423
00:59:35,461 --> 00:59:37,220
I didn't.
I still don't know what.

1424
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,390
He's hot and he said,
I'm sorry.

1425
00:59:39,350 --> 00:59:40,640
He gonna be at my window.
Hey girl,

1426
00:59:42,350 --> 00:59:43,910
I'm sorry.
I came home from the club.

1427
00:59:43,911 --> 00:59:45,740
I was a little drunk.
I've always had this thing for you.

1428
00:59:45,830 --> 00:59:47,700
I can't believe I was whispering.
Hey,

1429
00:59:47,730 --> 00:59:52,730
your pussy is disrespectful.
I apologize if he said it like that to 

1430
00:59:52,730 --> 00:59:55,630
take you out for drinks and just we'll 
make up to.

1431
00:59:55,660 --> 00:59:55,970
I'll.
Sorry,

1432
00:59:55,971 --> 00:59:57,110
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

1433
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:00,200
Well,
you know,

1434
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:02,690
you put it like that.
Who am I to turn down?

1435
01:00:02,870 --> 01:00:07,460
Here's my e harmony profile.
The terrifying part is that I don't know

1436
01:00:07,461 --> 01:00:12,461
who it was and it could have been.
It could be someone I know and even the 

1437
01:00:12,461 --> 01:00:13,940
way my neighbors described him was that 
it actually,

1438
01:00:14,030 --> 01:00:19,030
the way they described him did describe 
someone that I know and consider a 

1439
01:00:19,101 --> 01:00:19,460
friend.

1440
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:24,820
Oh,
but then when I showed my neighbor the 

1441
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:24,820
picture of the person I was talking 
about,

1442
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:24,820
they were like,
no,

1443
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:26,420
I don't think that's him,
but still now in the back of my head,

1444
01:00:26,421 --> 01:00:28,310
I'm like,
what if it was so now my friendship with

1445
01:00:28,311 --> 01:00:30,320
this person has been a little strained 
because of it.

1446
01:00:30,321 --> 01:00:30,720
Because I'm like,
well,

1447
01:00:30,721 --> 01:00:31,860
I don't trust you.
Whoa.

1448
01:00:32,270 --> 01:00:33,170
I know.
It's weird.

1449
01:00:33,770 --> 01:00:37,550
That is weird.
That's the life of a girl.

1450
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:43,540
We have enough to worry about.
Shit that guards won't have to worry 

1451
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:43,540
about.
So many things.

1452
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:46,740
There are no girls outside your window 
whispering good.

1453
01:00:46,970 --> 01:00:51,970
Well they are,
but it's because you dated them before 

1454
01:00:51,970 --> 01:00:56,160
and you wrong them and you cheated on 
them or did something and now she's 

1455
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:57,170
stalking you or you found out they're 
crazy and they know where you live.

1456
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:59,240
Yeah,
I love.

1457
01:00:59,260 --> 01:00:59,720
I'm,
I'm,

1458
01:00:59,730 --> 01:01:02,040
I'm,
I'm very interested in all of like,

1459
01:01:02,060 --> 01:01:05,600
like relationship behavior and like 
crimes of passion.

1460
01:01:06,170 --> 01:01:08,570
I like all of it.
I'm very into it.

1461
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:13,010
Look those annie shows or like snapped 
on oxygen.

1462
01:01:13,190 --> 01:01:15,560
Have you ever seen that it's.
It will snap.

1463
01:01:15,740 --> 01:01:17,060
Yes.
Mostly women.

1464
01:01:17,061 --> 01:01:19,790
It's mostly women.
Sometimes this is a mass oxygen.

1465
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:24,940
It is asked.
Does the women's channel absolutely 

1466
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:28,360
lifetime.
Why is oxygen and women's channel 

1467
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:28,850
oxygen's like air?
Everybody needs that.

1468
01:01:28,851 --> 01:01:30,180
I don't know.
Um,

1469
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:31,810
but yeah,
we were uh,

1470
01:01:31,830 --> 01:01:34,130
I was watching a snapped.
I watch it.

1471
01:01:34,131 --> 01:01:35,780
Not so much anymore but it's been on for
a long time,

1472
01:01:35,781 --> 01:01:39,980
but every episode is like a different 
couple and the woman is just like,

1473
01:01:39,981 --> 01:01:44,981
can't put up with shit anymore.
Like her dudes cheating on her or like 

1474
01:01:44,981 --> 01:01:46,520
taking her money or abusing her or 
whatever,

1475
01:01:46,521 --> 01:01:49,520
and then she snapped and she kills him.
Well,

1476
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:54,050
you always.
Zoe's a spoiler alert for every show.

1477
01:01:54,670 --> 01:01:58,760
You know where it's going to go and she 
just couldn't take it anymore.

1478
01:01:58,761 --> 01:02:03,761
It's in the title g one,
which is going to snap next dick flying 

1479
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:08,940
across the.
That's my only thing.

1480
01:02:09,321 --> 01:02:11,870
I don't want to be a victim of a crime 
of passion.

1481
01:02:12,590 --> 01:02:15,410
Just don't you just break up with me.
You don't have to kill me.

1482
01:02:15,710 --> 01:02:17,300
Yeah,
I hear you.

1483
01:02:17,310 --> 01:02:19,530
That's reasonable requests.
What's the craziest thing?

1484
01:02:19,531 --> 01:02:20,280
What's the craziest

1485
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:21,840
thing a girlfriend has ever done to you?

1486
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:28,300
Have you gotten your car key before?
No.

1487
01:02:29,690 --> 01:02:34,690
No.
I've been pretty good at navigating 

1488
01:02:34,690 --> 01:02:35,050
those waters.
I've got.

1489
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:35,990
Oh,
we got pretty good,

1490
01:02:35,991 --> 01:02:37,700
crazy radar.
Oh yeah.

1491
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:42,800
The problem is when they're really hot,
they're really hot and they're also 

1492
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:42,800
crazy.
Like,

1493
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:43,010
damn,
this might be worth the risk.

1494
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:43,850
That's usually what

1495
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:45,770
I guess.
I don't know if you've seen this.

1496
01:02:45,771 --> 01:02:50,771
It was on a,
it was a youtube clip and the guy do a 

1497
01:02:50,771 --> 01:02:54,011
chart and it was like a chart of crazy 
to hotness and it's.

1498
01:02:54,730 --> 01:02:57,740
It's like all the hot chicks are always 
crazy.

1499
01:02:57,741 --> 01:03:02,741
Instead if you'd have to and it 
basically tells you in what range you 

1500
01:03:02,741 --> 01:03:02,741
have to find the normal.
One

1501
01:03:02,741 --> 01:03:07,080
woman really funny.
My friend Tony Zara has it best.

1502
01:03:07,170 --> 01:03:12,170
He's got a.
He said that there's like erotic in 

1503
01:03:12,170 --> 01:03:14,280
neurotic and they crossover like a venn 
diagram.

1504
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:16,610
They hit this,
hit this crossroad there.

1505
01:03:16,620 --> 01:03:19,560
They're like the two interchangeable 
things.

1506
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:23,670
Completely closely related,
psychotic,

1507
01:03:23,820 --> 01:03:28,820
neurotic and erotic.
Right all together and see if you get 

1508
01:03:28,820 --> 01:03:31,410
the really erotic women,
they're almost always psychotic or,

1509
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:34,920
or neurotic or crazy.
There's something wrong.

1510
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:36,190
Yeah.
Yeah.

1511
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:38,160
Red Flag.
The really fun ones.

1512
01:03:38,370 --> 01:03:43,370
Yeah.
That just the ones that really want to 

1513
01:03:43,370 --> 01:03:43,370
rock your world there.
They're crazy.

1514
01:03:43,370 --> 01:03:44,830
I've heard that and so if you're 
wondering,

1515
01:03:44,831 --> 01:03:49,831
I'm,
I'm very normal again.

1516
01:03:50,591 --> 01:03:53,410
My parents loved me,
which means I don't do anal.

1517
01:03:59,430 --> 01:04:01,370
Good point.
That is a weird thing,

1518
01:04:01,371 --> 01:04:03,140
right?
If your parents love you too much,

1519
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:04,670
you might not be as ambitious.

1520
01:04:05,230 --> 01:04:06,640
I mean,
that is true,

1521
01:04:06,641 --> 01:04:09,460
like I wish I told her like I think I'm 
definitely ambitious,

1522
01:04:09,461 --> 01:04:11,140
like I'm definitely,
you know,

1523
01:04:11,141 --> 01:04:16,141
I've been doing this for like 10 years 
now and it's like I have come so far.

1524
01:04:16,331 --> 01:04:17,170
So it's like,
yeah,

1525
01:04:17,171 --> 01:04:22,171
no,
I definitely have goals and achieving 

1526
01:04:22,171 --> 01:04:22,171
them,
but it's also,

1527
01:04:22,171 --> 01:04:22,171
I'm also not like a,
Oh,

1528
01:04:22,171 --> 01:04:25,060
we were talking about earlier like the,
the ceos of these corporations,

1529
01:04:25,061 --> 01:04:30,061
like I don't have that kind of drive.
Like I just want to do what I love and 

1530
01:04:30,061 --> 01:04:31,060
make good money doing it to be lifted up
for 10 years.

1531
01:04:31,830 --> 01:04:33,940
Where'd you start here?
At the store.

1532
01:04:34,230 --> 01:04:37,420
Not Store,
but like in la I started uh,

1533
01:04:37,421 --> 01:04:38,800
the first place I got up,
you know,

1534
01:04:38,801 --> 01:04:43,801
doing open mics and stuff,
but I didn't want to go to the store at 

1535
01:04:43,801 --> 01:04:46,351
first because I was like,
I don't want to go there if I'm not 

1536
01:04:46,351 --> 01:04:46,351
funny yet.
Then who knows,

1537
01:04:46,351 --> 01:04:46,351
going to see me and they'll be like,
oh,

1538
01:04:46,351 --> 01:04:47,620
she's not funny.
When did you get past the store?

1539
01:04:47,890 --> 01:04:51,910
Like December of 2014.
So almost 2015,

1540
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:54,490
you know.
So that was right when I came back.

1541
01:04:54,550 --> 01:04:59,550
Yes,
it was right when you came back because 

1542
01:04:59,550 --> 01:04:59,550
that was right.
I was the first.

1543
01:04:59,550 --> 01:05:01,360
Me and [inaudible] were the first people
that Adam passed when he got promoted to

1544
01:05:01,361 --> 01:05:03,450
that position.
Yeah.

1545
01:05:03,610 --> 01:05:08,610
Because yeah,
I don't know if Tommy was ever going to 

1546
01:05:08,610 --> 01:05:08,610
pass me.
I don't know

1547
01:05:08,990 --> 01:05:10,750
Tommy.
I know it's a whole.

1548
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:14,160
So when.
Yeah,

1549
01:05:14,161 --> 01:05:16,770
when I came back there I got to see like
the whole new crop.

1550
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:19,660
There was a whole new crop of people in 
the seven years that I was gone.

1551
01:05:20,140 --> 01:05:22,720
Was it seven years?
I was gone for seven years.

1552
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:29,320
I thought I'd be gone forever if Adam,
if Tommy had fired and Adam take over.

1553
01:05:29,321 --> 01:05:30,330
I was still been.
Which is,

1554
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:33,450
that was the dumbest thing.
Well,

1555
01:05:33,490 --> 01:05:36,160
Miss Decision for me,
it was a good decision.

1556
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:37,840
It was good.
It was healthy.

1557
01:05:37,841 --> 01:05:39,310
To get away from the store for a little 
bit,

1558
01:05:39,490 --> 01:05:41,740
sort of changed my comedy,
made it a little less evil.

1559
01:05:46,380 --> 01:05:51,380
Blazes so harsh,
but haven't you noticed that the energy 

1560
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:54,120
has changed since taking over?
It's a different place.

1561
01:05:54,121 --> 01:05:59,121
It's a different place without Tommy.
It's a different place just because of 

1562
01:05:59,121 --> 01:06:01,810
the vibe of the comedy store is now.
I'm also fortified by the Internet.

1563
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:06,840
It's like people who love the place 
because it's this iconic historical 

1564
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:08,350
landmark.
It's like the Mecca of comedy.

1565
01:06:08,620 --> 01:06:11,170
It really is the Mecca in the country 
now.

1566
01:06:11,171 --> 01:06:13,780
It's the real Mecca work.
When I was a kid,

1567
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:16,690
when I was first starting out,
I had heard about the comedy store,

1568
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:22,040
you know,
because Sam kinison started out there 

1569
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:22,040
and Richard Pryor was always there and I
looked.

1570
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:23,050
That was the place I needed to go to the
comedy store.

1571
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:28,440
When I came out here,
I was already on a Sitcom and I didn't 

1572
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:30,010
get passed at the store.
I was a non paid regular,

1573
01:06:30,011 --> 01:06:32,200
so I was able to go on at the end of the
shows.

1574
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:35,560
When I first got here,
when I got passed as a paid regular,

1575
01:06:35,561 --> 01:06:37,720
it was like the happiest moment of my 
life.

1576
01:06:38,290 --> 01:06:39,490
I was like,
Holy Shit,

1577
01:06:39,970 --> 01:06:43,780
I'm a paid regular at the comedy store.
Like that to me was bigger than being on

1578
01:06:43,781 --> 01:06:45,610
a television show.
I'm here,

1579
01:06:45,790 --> 01:06:48,640
but back then the comedy store was a 
ghost town.

1580
01:06:49,030 --> 01:06:51,280
It was deserted.
It was no one.

1581
01:06:51,281 --> 01:06:54,070
There you go on a Friday night to be 30 
people in the audience.

1582
01:06:54,071 --> 01:06:58,300
It was just gross and there was a lot of
boat acts still floating around.

1583
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:02,620
So like something happened between the 
Kinison Age,

1584
01:07:02,621 --> 01:07:04,590
right?
Kennison age was like 84,

1585
01:07:04,630 --> 01:07:09,630
87,
88 and in that time that guy was just 

1586
01:07:09,630 --> 01:07:14,280
running rampant and destroying and he 
was a maniac and he was the top of the 

1587
01:07:14,591 --> 01:07:19,591
world and then he dropped off and then 
he died and then when he died,

1588
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:21,280
that place was a ghost town.

1589
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:23,380
So when I came along right after he 
died,

1590
01:07:23,410 --> 01:07:26,200
I came along in [inaudible] 94 and there
was no one there.

1591
01:07:26,350 --> 01:07:29,410
So it went from being this jam packed,
like literally always here.

1592
01:07:29,411 --> 01:07:34,411
Like all these celebrities come to see 
Kennison do spots late at night and be 

1593
01:07:34,411 --> 01:07:34,411
like,
Whoa,

1594
01:07:34,411 --> 01:07:37,060
that must have been nuts.
John Belushi be there and Jack Nicholson

1595
01:07:37,061 --> 01:07:39,370
and all these different people and then 
you go there.

1596
01:07:39,610 --> 01:07:41,410
I don't know,
it was John Belushi was probably dead by

1597
01:07:41,411 --> 01:07:45,060
then when the John Belushi died.
He died in 18.

1598
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:46,860
80 two.
Yeah.

1599
01:07:46,870 --> 01:07:48,910
He died earlier than that.
Yeah.

1600
01:07:50,310 --> 01:07:52,120
I shouldn't have said John Belushi.
I might've made that up,

1601
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:57,300
but I know Jack Nicholson,
a bunch of other celebrities use 

1602
01:07:57,300 --> 01:07:57,300
Kennison and I remember thinking,
man,

1603
01:07:57,300 --> 01:07:59,480
nobody famous comes here now.
This is a shit hole.

1604
01:07:59,950 --> 01:08:03,520
There was nobody there,
but it's different now.

1605
01:08:03,820 --> 01:08:05,180
Now,
now,

1606
01:08:05,740 --> 01:08:08,620
now it's every show sold out every show,
every show.

1607
01:08:08,730 --> 01:08:10,660
It's nuts.
Last time it was crazy.

1608
01:08:11,410 --> 01:08:12,740
I was thinking that the other day was 
like,

1609
01:08:12,930 --> 01:08:15,680
what a time for me to be like a regular 
at the store.

1610
01:08:15,681 --> 01:08:16,040
Like it

1611
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:21,040
just happened at the perfect time.
Like it just because I know so many 

1612
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:22,800
people that were like were door guys 
back when like,

1613
01:08:22,801 --> 01:08:27,801
and I've heard stories like bobby would 
tell me stories from when he used to 

1614
01:08:27,801 --> 01:08:30,641
work there and like Freddy Lockhart and 
when they were like door guys and I'm 

1615
01:08:30,641 --> 01:08:32,270
like wow,
that sounds so shitty.

1616
01:08:32,271 --> 01:08:33,530
And like what?
They were getting paid.

1617
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:36,560
They're getting paid like $25 for the 
day.

1618
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:42,310
Awful.
Yeah.

1619
01:08:42,450 --> 01:08:44,910
I met Bob,
he was a door guy at the La Jolla store.

1620
01:08:45,050 --> 01:08:45,460
Yeah,
yeah,

1621
01:08:45,470 --> 01:08:50,470
yeah.
When I'm at Bobby's like 1994 or some 

1622
01:08:50,470 --> 01:08:50,600
shit like that.
Uh,

1623
01:08:51,030 --> 01:08:53,670
we went to a strip club and he almost 
got killed.

1624
01:08:53,820 --> 01:08:54,840
What?
I mean,

1625
01:08:54,870 --> 01:08:57,060
that sounds about right first I'm like,
what?

1626
01:08:57,180 --> 01:09:00,570
Like hitting on some girl and apparently
she was,

1627
01:09:01,110 --> 01:09:06,110
she was Mexican gang banger and this guy
who had long black hair and tattoos on 

1628
01:09:06,110 --> 01:09:09,180
his face in the nineties,
in the nineties,

1629
01:09:09,510 --> 01:09:14,340
he had tattoos on his face wasn't even 
popular and then the guy,

1630
01:09:14,370 --> 01:09:16,800
he was looking over at me and then 
they're talking to his friends.

1631
01:09:16,801 --> 01:09:18,720
I go,
we are getting the fuck outta here.

1632
01:09:18,721 --> 01:09:20,940
I think Jimmy Schubert was with me,
just me and gibby.

1633
01:09:20,941 --> 01:09:22,240
Schubert and Bobby Lee.
I go,

1634
01:09:22,260 --> 01:09:24,300
we're getting the fuck out of here.
And Bob was like,

1635
01:09:24,630 --> 01:09:25,830
those guys aren't going to do shit.
I go,

1636
01:09:25,860 --> 01:09:28,320
I will fucking leave you.
I go,

1637
01:09:28,321 --> 01:09:30,570
you don't have any idea what danger is 
like?

1638
01:09:30,571 --> 01:09:32,060
Well those guys are going to do 
something.

1639
01:09:33,420 --> 01:09:35,880
I wasn't worried about fighting.
I was worried about getting shot.

1640
01:09:36,910 --> 01:09:39,570
This is going to murder.
This is a bad scene,

1641
01:09:39,571 --> 01:09:41,250
dude.
We gotta get Outta here now.

1642
01:09:42,090 --> 01:09:43,020
And Bobby was like,
those guys,

1643
01:09:43,021 --> 01:09:43,890
you ain't gonna do shit.
I'm like,

1644
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:46,680
who is the smallest person here?
Well,

1645
01:09:46,681 --> 01:09:47,350
he was,
you know,

1646
01:09:47,490 --> 01:09:49,350
21 years old or whatever the fuck he 
was.

1647
01:09:49,351 --> 01:09:50,190
He was out of his mind

1648
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:55,440
child.
I mean he's still a childlike in many 

1649
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:55,440
ways,
but yes,

1650
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:55,720
it will always remain one way or is a 
man.

1651
01:09:56,810 --> 01:09:59,560
I tell his girlfriend all the time.
I was like,

1652
01:09:59,561 --> 01:10:01,570
you're the most patient woman in the 
world to deal with him.

1653
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:04,780
That's an odd couple.
It's a very odd couple.

1654
01:10:05,030 --> 01:10:07,050
It seems to work though.
They've been bother.

1655
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:09,550
It's insane.
And they met on tinder.

1656
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:11,350
Kapow.
Yeah,

1657
01:10:11,710 --> 01:10:14,480
it worked it.
I know two people that work there.

1658
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:19,510
I said it worked.
And you went because I know two people 

1659
01:10:19,510 --> 01:10:22,351
that it worked for them.
And also I know a couple is getting 

1660
01:10:22,351 --> 01:10:22,351
married this weekend.
Who met on tinder?

1661
01:10:22,351 --> 01:10:22,351
Well,
there you go.

1662
01:10:22,351 --> 01:10:24,530
Maybe it's you,
maybe it's you.

1663
01:10:25,180 --> 01:10:27,010
Maybe you need to give tinder second 
chance.

1664
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:32,140
No,
for sure it is me because I refused to 

1665
01:10:32,140 --> 01:10:32,140
settle.
I know for sure it is me.

1666
01:10:32,140 --> 01:10:35,400
How do you think using your vision board
and all of your manifesting,

1667
01:10:35,401 --> 01:10:40,110
how can you get someone in your life 
that you need in your life?

1668
01:10:40,420 --> 01:10:41,790
I honestly,
honestly,

1669
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:42,960
honestly,
honestly,

1670
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:48,960
honestly I think of your name.
I think of tyrone smoke rocks.

1671
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:56,680
That was my first white man.
I knew you from fear factor,

1672
01:10:56,681 --> 01:10:58,090
but I also,
that was a huge,

1673
01:10:58,091 --> 01:10:59,150
you know,
for,

1674
01:10:59,310 --> 01:11:04,310
for me before I even knew I'd be doing 
standup and I'm watching the Chappelle 

1675
01:11:04,310 --> 01:11:04,810
show and I just remember I love it.
It makes me laugh so much.

1676
01:11:05,020 --> 01:11:09,010
Joe Rogan,
my feet are strong,

1677
01:11:09,110 --> 01:11:11,280
poses a great character.
I like,

1678
01:11:11,281 --> 01:11:16,281
I've tried to do crack impressions,
crack Ad Impressions for jokes before 

1679
01:11:16,281 --> 01:11:21,200
and I can't because every time I try to 
do an original crack head impression 

1680
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:23,010
like just from my own,
you know,

1681
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:26,790
inspiration and from watching other like
real crackheads,

1682
01:11:26,791 --> 01:11:31,020
I can't do it because the default 
crackhead is now tyrone Brigham's and it

1683
01:11:31,021 --> 01:11:31,530
just.
And I'm like,

1684
01:11:31,531 --> 01:11:36,531
I can't do it because I can't do.
Tyrone becomes on certain people that 

1685
01:11:36,531 --> 01:11:37,620
create characters that forever.
They're iconic,

1686
01:11:38,220 --> 01:11:40,830
that that's the crack head for the rest 
of,

1687
01:11:40,831 --> 01:11:43,400
for the rest of time out.

1688
01:11:48,530 --> 01:11:53,530
It's an amazing show.
Was only two seasons and that it was 15 

1689
01:11:55,471 --> 01:11:56,720
years ago.
Wow.

1690
01:11:58,510 --> 01:12:00,930
And even more amazing than he just said,
fuck it.

1691
01:12:00,931 --> 01:12:04,290
And left and left.
Sorry.

1692
01:12:04,350 --> 01:12:05,330
GotTa go.
Yeah.

1693
01:12:05,580 --> 01:12:07,680
I mean I get it though.
I get it.

1694
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:10,020
I totally get it.
I was on it.

1695
01:12:10,140 --> 01:12:14,670
I was on comedy central at the time and 
I saw like the management and how it was

1696
01:12:14,671 --> 01:12:16,440
working there.
It was chaos.

1697
01:12:16,770 --> 01:12:19,440
And then whenever you tell people that 
aren't funny,

1698
01:12:19,650 --> 01:12:22,800
that are executives,
tell them to manage funny.

1699
01:12:23,030 --> 01:12:28,030
You're right.
I don't know what the fuck they're 

1700
01:12:28,030 --> 01:12:28,030
doing.
They have no idea.

1701
01:12:28,030 --> 01:12:29,310
Let Dave Chappelle be David,
trust me,

1702
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:32,610
he's gonna.
Make the most funny and let him and Neal

1703
01:12:32,610 --> 01:12:36,270
Brennan go figure out what they're doing
and just get out of the way.

1704
01:12:36,330 --> 01:12:37,950
Get out of the way and put ads on it.
Yeah,

1705
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:41,080
and you saw the success of what had 
happened with what they did with that.

1706
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:42,350
Yeah.
You know,

1707
01:12:42,351 --> 01:12:44,150
they try to do a bunch of shit with him.
They tried to,

1708
01:12:44,151 --> 01:12:46,100
first of all,
they're trying to get to change changes,

1709
01:12:46,101 --> 01:12:47,750
language,
stop using the n word.

1710
01:12:48,150 --> 01:12:50,330
They want me to stop using because they 
would get more ads.

1711
01:12:50,870 --> 01:12:55,870
It was all about people not comfortable 
with advertising with certain kinds of 

1712
01:12:55,870 --> 01:12:57,680
sketches,
so they wanted to maximize their profits

1713
01:12:58,110 --> 01:13:01,970
but so tone down the show,
a little maximize their profits and Dave

1714
01:13:01,971 --> 01:13:03,300
was like,
I see where this is going on.

1715
01:13:03,590 --> 01:13:04,880
Yeah,
lose complete control.

1716
01:13:05,030 --> 01:13:06,340
He just quit.
Yeah.

1717
01:13:06,630 --> 01:13:09,590
Imagine the executives when they found 
out he was really quitting,

1718
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:13,080
they were like,
he's just joshing yeah,

1719
01:13:13,081 --> 01:13:14,690
they probably just bluffing.
Yeah,

1720
01:13:14,700 --> 01:13:19,700
he's.
He doesn't like the way you guys are 

1721
01:13:19,700 --> 01:13:19,740
shaping the show.
So he's going to quit and he's in Africa

1722
01:13:19,741 --> 01:13:24,741
now by click,
but we were just to make $180,000,000,

1723
01:13:25,790 --> 01:13:27,150
but we were just going to make honor.

1724
01:13:29,820 --> 01:13:31,370
Dave just quit.
You guys blew it,

1725
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:32,570
you know,
people don't remember,

1726
01:13:32,571 --> 01:13:35,360
but for a while Dave was doing shows and
he wasn't getting paid.

1727
01:13:35,570 --> 01:13:39,050
He wouldn't do shows where he got paid.
He would show up in the park.

1728
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:41,330
He showed up in Seattle.
It was like a big deal.

1729
01:13:41,331 --> 01:13:46,331
He put up a speaker,
he put up his own PA system and started 

1730
01:13:46,331 --> 01:13:49,130
doing standup in the park and a crowd 
gathered round of course,

1731
01:13:49,131 --> 01:13:54,131
and that's what he would do.
He would just show up places to start 

1732
01:13:54,131 --> 01:13:54,290
doing standup.
That's crazy.

1733
01:13:54,350 --> 01:13:56,060
That's what he did.
You know what I met Dave,

1734
01:13:56,061 --> 01:13:59,030
I met Dave is like,
how is 21?

1735
01:13:59,180 --> 01:14:02,030
He was like 18,
something like that or maybe maybe I was

1736
01:14:02,031 --> 01:14:07,031
a little older.
It goes like 24 and he was 18 and he 

1737
01:14:07,031 --> 01:14:07,070
was,
he would do,

1738
01:14:07,430 --> 01:14:10,910
he would do shows outside,
like we would do a Gig.

1739
01:14:10,910 --> 01:14:13,800
We a Gig in Montreal and then after we 
did the Gig of Macho,

1740
01:14:13,801 --> 01:14:17,860
he came downstairs outside of club soda 
and he just started doing standup on the

1741
01:14:17,861 --> 01:14:20,320
street.
He goes,

1742
01:14:20,321 --> 01:14:22,350
ladies and Gentlemen,
Ladies and gentlemen,

1743
01:14:22,390 --> 01:14:25,180
gather around.
I got some shit to tell you.

1744
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:30,360
And then he would start doing standup on
the street and he learned it from a 

1745
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:32,480
Charlie Burnett.
Charlie Barnett who was a.

1746
01:14:33,490 --> 01:14:38,490
He was like an old school New York 
character who did a lot of street 

1747
01:14:38,490 --> 01:14:38,590
comedy.
We didn't.

1748
01:14:38,591 --> 01:14:40,220
We have a video of Charlie Barnett.
There's.

1749
01:14:40,300 --> 01:14:41,820
There's one online he would do.
Yeah,

1750
01:14:41,830 --> 01:14:46,830
like this is what he would do.
Charlie Barnett would do comedy like 

1751
01:14:46,830 --> 01:14:48,040
this,
like he got these giant crowds and would

1752
01:14:48,041 --> 01:14:53,041
walk around like a park and get 
everybody gather around and he was such 

1753
01:14:53,041 --> 01:14:56,190
a showman that people would just sit and
wait and they will do standup.

1754
01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:58,780
Here it is in Washington Square Park.
That's insane.

1755
01:14:58,781 --> 01:14:58,920
Yeah.

1756
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:06,530
No Mike,
we've got a nice mixed route.

1757
01:15:06,710 --> 01:15:07,160
I mean,
look,

1758
01:15:07,161 --> 01:15:09,070
when we got,
we got white folks,

1759
01:15:11,450 --> 01:15:16,030
black folks.
We got quite a ray guns.

1760
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:28,080
We got a lot of fucking part of Reagan's
but I'm not gonna fuck with them for the

1761
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:33,280
man because y'all born with knives.
Got Me up and I.

1762
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:33,680
He

1763
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:34,920
was.
He would do this.

1764
01:15:34,921 --> 01:15:37,170
This is how he would do up anyway,
yell it out in the park.

1765
01:15:37,380 --> 01:15:41,520
I got a chance to see him a couple.
He died of AIDS like somewhere.

1766
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:44,040
I think it was in the early nineties.
He died,

1767
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:47,500
but I got to see him.
That's when people were dying of AIDS.

1768
01:15:48,150 --> 01:15:51,180
Back back when AIDS will kill you.
Now aids is like the flu.

1769
01:15:51,320 --> 01:15:52,500
Yeah,
like everybody got it.

1770
01:15:52,740 --> 01:15:54,330
Yeah,
don't whine if got aids.

1771
01:15:54,540 --> 01:15:59,460
My uncle's got leukemia.
Don't even have medication for that.

1772
01:15:59,550 --> 01:16:04,550
Broke the Charlie Barnett influenced 
dave and Dave would do that kind of 

1773
01:16:05,701 --> 01:16:06,810
stand up,
you know,

1774
01:16:06,811 --> 01:16:09,060
Dave would just do standup in front of a
club.

1775
01:16:09,090 --> 01:16:12,450
He would just get and people just gather
around and watch him.

1776
01:16:12,810 --> 01:16:14,250
And I remember thinking like,
wow,

1777
01:16:14,420 --> 01:16:16,590
I'm not really me.
I could never do that.

1778
01:16:16,591 --> 01:16:21,591
But man,
that kind of detachment to be able to 

1779
01:16:21,591 --> 01:16:24,741
just,
just be free in front of a crowd like 

1780
01:16:24,741 --> 01:16:25,230
that.
That's powerful.

1781
01:16:25,270 --> 01:16:30,270
And you know,
we've performed in all different types 

1782
01:16:30,270 --> 01:16:30,270
of really terrible places,
you know,

1783
01:16:30,270 --> 01:16:34,531
when you're coming up and you're just 
doing open mics and bars and coffee 

1784
01:16:34,531 --> 01:16:37,891
shops or whatever.
And I still to this day roll my eyes 

1785
01:16:37,891 --> 01:16:40,981
when someone's,
it's an outdoor venue because it's just 

1786
01:16:40,981 --> 01:16:40,981
like a,
you know,

1787
01:16:40,981 --> 01:16:42,910
there's nothing to.
Right.

1788
01:16:43,170 --> 01:16:44,140
So like the,
the,

1789
01:16:44,410 --> 01:16:47,590
the laugh just get lost.
They just disappear into the ether.

1790
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:49,820
And so the arenas too,
when you do stand up,

1791
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:53,770
not that performed in an arena.
It's on my vision board though.

1792
01:16:54,070 --> 01:16:59,070
Is it right next to the Dick?
What's your visual boy?

1793
01:17:00,021 --> 01:17:04,000
That's weird.
That's weird.

1794
01:17:04,740 --> 01:17:06,330
You got anything crazy in your vision 
board?

1795
01:17:07,050 --> 01:17:08,730
You get a private jet on your vision 
board.

1796
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:10,160
Is that.
Do you have one?

1797
01:17:11,150 --> 01:17:13,580
It's actually not on my vision board,
but I do visualize it.

1798
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:15,170
Do you?
I do visualize,

1799
01:17:15,171 --> 01:17:16,710
visualize,
visualize and meditate.

1800
01:17:16,770 --> 01:17:21,770
Do you visualize you strolling with a 
tiny bag with a dog in it and you go 

1801
01:17:21,770 --> 01:17:23,750
like a cigarette holder and giant 
glasses.

1802
01:17:23,810 --> 01:17:28,810
Cigarette holder than just like,
like stroll on with high heels to let 

1803
01:17:32,410 --> 01:17:34,400
those tight skirt.
Like,

1804
01:17:34,470 --> 01:17:35,750
Oh,
where's my seat?

1805
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:38,180
Whereas my seat in the fuck,
I want it to be bitch.

1806
01:17:38,300 --> 01:17:43,300
This is my pet,
my dog shit on the floor and play 

1807
01:17:43,300 --> 01:17:47,550
motherfucker.
Now my private jet is going to be much 

1808
01:17:47,550 --> 01:17:47,580
more basic than then.
You know,

1809
01:17:47,670 --> 01:17:52,670
I just want to a plane where if like I,
I can fart freely and not have to worry 

1810
01:17:52,670 --> 01:17:56,351
about other people.
One time I held a Fart from Cincinnati 

1811
01:17:56,351 --> 01:17:56,351
to Los Angeles.
That's very polite of you.

1812
01:17:56,620 --> 01:17:57,940
Thank you.
Firstly,

1813
01:17:57,950 --> 01:17:59,680
on a plane.
A lot of people are sneaky on.

1814
01:17:59,930 --> 01:18:01,610
No,
but I was like,

1815
01:18:01,611 --> 01:18:05,880
I can't do this to anybody and very 
considerate person.

1816
01:18:05,950 --> 01:18:08,120
If it was your plane,
let him loose.

1817
01:18:08,121 --> 01:18:10,790
What if it was your plane and you had a 
stewardess still let it loose.

1818
01:18:11,210 --> 01:18:13,070
Flight attendance.
Oh,

1819
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:18,640
what's the difference?
Because you can't change it to flight 

1820
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:19,490
attendant because they have a male 
flight attendants because you can't call

1821
01:18:19,491 --> 01:18:24,491
a male stewardess.
Do they really have male flight 

1822
01:18:24,491 --> 01:18:24,491
attendants?
Haven't you?

1823
01:18:24,730 --> 01:18:26,310
I've seen him on the daily mail.

1824
01:18:32,900 --> 01:18:34,430
More feminine than me,
but yes,

1825
01:18:34,431 --> 01:18:37,610
there's still went to the dentist today 
and I had to fill out.

1826
01:18:37,611 --> 01:18:42,611
One of them were so like I had to fill 
out this form and on the form it said 

1827
01:18:43,580 --> 01:18:46,910
sex.
It said male or female.

1828
01:18:46,940 --> 01:18:48,440
I was like,
where's the other?

1829
01:18:49,100 --> 01:18:51,710
Whereas other bitch,
where's uh,

1830
01:18:52,210 --> 01:18:54,800
where's Kins?
Whereas other kids,

1831
01:18:54,830 --> 01:18:55,760
other kids?
Yeah.

1832
01:18:55,770 --> 01:18:58,130
You don't know about other kids.
Don't know what that is.

1833
01:18:58,190 --> 01:18:59,750
Oh,
those people that think they're a fox,

1834
01:18:59,780 --> 01:19:04,780
they identify with foxes like an Elf.
Can people think they're fairies would?

1835
01:19:05,630 --> 01:19:10,630
I'm a wood Elf.
No other kin people think that there's 

1836
01:19:10,630 --> 01:19:14,261
something.
They're supposed to be something else 

1837
01:19:14,261 --> 01:19:16,110
there like a person,
but really they're an animal that's 

1838
01:19:16,110 --> 01:19:16,810
trapped in a person's body.
No,

1839
01:19:16,940 --> 01:19:18,230
just crazy.
Are they?

1840
01:19:18,260 --> 01:19:19,340
Here we go.
This lady,

1841
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,070
when people ask me,
how's it feel to be a cat?

1842
01:19:22,130 --> 01:19:24,230
I'm like,
how does it feel to be a human?

1843
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:25,400
Oh,
that's rational.

1844
01:19:25,401 --> 01:19:28,880
Whoever you your dad is,
hey dude,

1845
01:19:29,150 --> 01:19:31,010
who's her dad?
Fuck you.

1846
01:19:31,340 --> 01:19:33,650
Look what you did to the world.
You asshole.

1847
01:19:33,950 --> 01:19:35,720
You let this girl.
Lucy thinks she's a cat.

1848
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:36,580
Yeah,
no,

1849
01:19:36,590 --> 01:19:38,690
that's,
that's when you have a.

1850
01:19:39,190 --> 01:19:41,930
that's a.
that's definitely a mental issue.

1851
01:19:42,090 --> 01:19:44,660
Oh,
for sure.

1852
01:19:44,710 --> 01:19:48,680
Like Rachel Dolezal,
she's one of document.

1853
01:19:48,730 --> 01:19:49,740
Oh,
I'm obsessed with her.

1854
01:19:50,010 --> 01:19:50,600
It was boring.

1855
01:19:52,660 --> 01:19:55,070
It was just,
she's,

1856
01:19:55,330 --> 01:19:57,340
she's going crazy.
She owes money.

1857
01:19:57,380 --> 01:20:00,620
She's dead and she's got kids.
I feel bad for the kids,

1858
01:20:01,340 --> 01:20:03,870
but who is this dude that she's with?
Who is this dude?

1859
01:20:03,930 --> 01:20:06,140
She just had a baby not that long ago.
Some dry works.

1860
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:09,250
Yeah.
I'll just get on my nerves.

1861
01:20:14,020 --> 01:20:16,130
Just have sex with anything.
Well,

1862
01:20:16,190 --> 01:20:18,360
it's.
If it's everything or nothing,

1863
01:20:20,030 --> 01:20:21,810
that dude could have got it from 
somewhere else.

1864
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:24,450
If you fucked her,
could he really?

1865
01:20:25,010 --> 01:20:30,010
Did he ever pick of the litter dudes who
are unattractive?

1866
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:35,360
Poor,
sleeping on someone else's couch and 

1867
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:35,360
they're still getting vagina?
So yes,

1868
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:38,700
they must be good talkers.
Women don't have standards anymore.

1869
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:40,650
You do?
I do.

1870
01:20:40,830 --> 01:20:44,160
Well,
my parents loved me many times.

1871
01:20:44,660 --> 01:20:46,920
That's going to be the name of my first 
special.

1872
01:20:47,370 --> 01:20:48,530
Actually know the name of my first 
session.

1873
01:20:48,531 --> 01:20:49,770
Was I going to be.
I'm a very busy man.

1874
01:20:49,790 --> 01:20:54,790
A book.
This book will not be that good because 

1875
01:20:54,790 --> 01:20:56,691
my parents love this special.
Hang on me funny because my parents 

1876
01:20:56,691 --> 01:20:58,870
loved me.
It's finished everything with my parents

1877
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:01,020
because my parents loved me.
But you are very funny.

1878
01:21:01,230 --> 01:21:04,470
So that doesn't work.
I'm not.

1879
01:21:04,580 --> 01:21:06,930
You're not.
You're not crazy.

1880
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:10,140
Like ambitious to the point where you 
ruin the step.

1881
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:15,030
Walk on people's backs and cut people 
because my parents loved me.

1882
01:21:15,330 --> 01:21:17,190
That's what that.
That's where that comes from.

1883
01:21:17,300 --> 01:21:19,720
You know that narcissistic personality 
disorder,

1884
01:21:19,721 --> 01:21:23,940
sociopathy comes from some type of 
neglect or abuse in childhood.

1885
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:24,720
Yes.
So,

1886
01:21:24,890 --> 01:21:29,890
and we do in this industry attracts a 
lot of that now people at Ted tension 

1887
01:21:29,890 --> 01:21:32,130
starved and they just want fame.
So you have the people who,

1888
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:33,720
there's two types of people in the 
industry,

1889
01:21:33,721 --> 01:21:36,300
you've got the people who really just 
loved the craft of it,

1890
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:41,360
they really are great actors or great 
comics writers and then you have the 

1891
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:43,530
kind that just want to be famous who 
don't give a crap about,

1892
01:21:43,531 --> 01:21:45,720
you know,
what it takes to actually,

1893
01:21:45,721 --> 01:21:48,330
you know,
a hone that skill and become the best at

1894
01:21:48,331 --> 01:21:49,080
that.
They just want.

1895
01:21:49,100 --> 01:21:50,940
And some of them pretend to be the other
thing.

1896
01:21:51,030 --> 01:21:52,230
Absolutely.
Yeah.

1897
01:21:52,470 --> 01:21:53,760
Absolutely.
Yeah.

1898
01:21:53,910 --> 01:21:54,780
Which is weird.
I mean,

1899
01:21:54,781 --> 01:21:55,890
it's crazy.
People everywhere.

1900
01:21:56,400 --> 01:22:01,400
Some of them like pretend to be comics,
like they pretend to be interested in 

1901
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:03,420
the craft of comedy and you know what,
when it gets really weird,

1902
01:22:03,421 --> 01:22:06,210
when they become famous and then you see
it happens all the time.

1903
01:22:06,930 --> 01:22:08,880
You see that they don't.
This is an actor.

1904
01:22:08,881 --> 01:22:10,320
They were acting like they're a 
comedian.

1905
01:22:10,321 --> 01:22:10,930
Yeah.
That's not,

1906
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:14,550
they're not really comic.
But then we let them get stage time.

1907
01:22:17,590 --> 01:22:19,790
You and I don't have any control over 
that.

1908
01:22:19,820 --> 01:22:21,350
Anybody getting stage time?
Yeah.

1909
01:22:21,540 --> 01:22:22,290
No,
I know,

1910
01:22:22,380 --> 01:22:24,330
but it's frustrating.
Why did you get into it?

1911
01:22:24,660 --> 01:22:29,660
I have,
I believe my pain when I was a kid was 

1912
01:22:29,660 --> 01:22:34,071
just feeling like I didn't fit in like 
out there when you were telling me 

1913
01:22:34,071 --> 01:22:35,670
you're not black.
Like that was my pain because I am black

1914
01:22:35,671 --> 01:22:40,320
and so I grew up feeling like I didn't 
fit in anywhere where you are at,

1915
01:22:40,380 --> 01:22:42,630
you are a certain percentage.
African American.

1916
01:22:42,631 --> 01:22:46,560
My parents are black and someone was 
white.

1917
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:47,360
Well yeah.
No,

1918
01:22:47,370 --> 01:22:48,990
somewhere along the line.
But there's mixes,

1919
01:22:48,991 --> 01:22:50,550
there's black,
native American and there's white.

1920
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:51,870
Um,
but yeah,

1921
01:22:51,871 --> 01:22:55,260
if you saw my family you'd be like,
there's no white people in this family.

1922
01:22:55,380 --> 01:23:00,380
If you saw my family be like somebody 
somewhere along the lines to chimp at 

1923
01:23:00,380 --> 01:23:01,500
chimp.
So many fucked a chimp.

1924
01:23:01,530 --> 01:23:02,640
Why do you want to,
shouldn't have,

1925
01:23:02,970 --> 01:23:07,970
you know,
I think this is what I think about my 

1926
01:23:07,970 --> 01:23:07,970
family.
Tiality in

1927
01:23:07,970 --> 01:23:08,470
your talents in general.
I feel like,

1928
01:23:08,740 --> 01:23:10,570
you know,
people evolved from Apes.

1929
01:23:11,170 --> 01:23:12,730
I don't believe that.
You don't believe that.

1930
01:23:13,130 --> 01:23:18,130
I think somewhere along the line 
somebody went back when they shouldn't 

1931
01:23:18,130 --> 01:23:18,440
have somebody who went by,
they were like,

1932
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:18,810
well,
you know,

1933
01:23:19,250 --> 01:23:22,960
fuck fucking needs apes over.
Get One last shot at the monkey.

1934
01:23:23,590 --> 01:23:25,690
She wasn't saying she wasn't talking 
back to me.

1935
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:29,830
She never burned my meatloaf banana.
That's all she wanted.

1936
01:23:30,730 --> 01:23:34,240
She would let me stick stuff wherever,
wherever I wanted to stick stuff.

1937
01:23:36,460 --> 01:23:38,740
She was warm to cuddle with and the 
winter months.

1938
01:23:38,860 --> 01:23:40,840
Yeah.
Well everyone's African.

1939
01:23:41,300 --> 01:23:46,300
Every single human.
If you treat them all the way back that 

1940
01:23:46,300 --> 01:23:46,300
23 and me.
Shit,

1941
01:23:46,300 --> 01:23:47,720
I just did it.
I don't know.

1942
01:23:47,730 --> 01:23:49,420
I'm waiting.
Have to wait a couple more weeks.

1943
01:23:49,421 --> 01:23:50,830
I'm very excited.
It sounds scared.

1944
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:53,050
Uh Nah.
What could it be?

1945
01:23:53,110 --> 01:23:58,110
I'm mostly.
I'm supposed to be mostly Italian and I 

1946
01:23:58,110 --> 01:23:59,920
have like a quarter Irish in me.
That's what it's supposed to be.

1947
01:24:00,820 --> 01:24:05,320
Let's see if anybody was sneaking around
my DNA.

1948
01:24:05,910 --> 01:24:10,910
Maybe a German got in the mix or an 
African or Moroccan or who knows?

1949
01:24:11,390 --> 01:24:14,410
He knows.
He got in the mix back in the day.

1950
01:24:14,570 --> 01:24:15,530
Hilarious.
You know,

1951
01:24:15,531 --> 01:24:20,531
I'm too.
I don't think I'm going to do one of 

1952
01:24:20,531 --> 01:24:20,531
those.
I don't want to know,

1953
01:24:20,531 --> 01:24:20,531
I don't want to know if I find that I'm 
whiter than I am.

1954
01:24:20,531 --> 01:24:21,920
I'll just walk into traffic.

1955
01:24:22,870 --> 01:24:24,630
Your,
your skin is lighter than mine.

1956
01:24:24,650 --> 01:24:25,050
No,
I know.

1957
01:24:25,051 --> 01:24:25,910
But so what,
like,

1958
01:24:26,010 --> 01:24:27,120
okay,
you have to fence.

1959
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:29,850
Jesus can just settle down.

1960
01:24:32,130 --> 01:24:36,030
It's crazy because like you have like me
and my sister were from the same parents

1961
01:24:36,300 --> 01:24:41,300
but she had a completely different 
childhood than me because no one ever 

1962
01:24:41,300 --> 01:24:44,211
questioned.
She never got her hair pulled by like 

1963
01:24:44,211 --> 01:24:44,211
darker skin,
black girls.

1964
01:24:44,211 --> 01:24:44,211
Whereas I did.
Why?

1965
01:24:44,211 --> 01:24:48,250
Why did she not get her hair?
She's darker than me and her hair is 

1966
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:48,480
kinkier so just she just came out 
different.

1967
01:24:48,540 --> 01:24:51,080
She came out brown.
So yeah.

1968
01:24:51,081 --> 01:24:52,560
So we had to complete.
So that's where,

1969
01:24:52,590 --> 01:24:54,090
that's where my pain came from.
It was like,

1970
01:24:54,091 --> 01:24:56,610
I felt like I didn't fit in,
you know,

1971
01:24:56,780 --> 01:24:57,210
so

1972
01:24:57,450 --> 01:25:02,450
like the.
So your comedy is so sort of like you 

1973
01:25:02,450 --> 01:25:04,620
have like a personality that was kind of
compensating for not fitting in.

1974
01:25:04,650 --> 01:25:06,980
Yeah,
I started being funny because I,

1975
01:25:07,060 --> 01:25:09,270
I felt like that could distract people 
from,

1976
01:25:09,330 --> 01:25:14,330
you know,
like I'll want them to like me and 

1977
01:25:14,330 --> 01:25:14,330
accept me.
So the one thing that everyone can agree

1978
01:25:14,330 --> 01:25:15,180
on is that we like jokes and I'm like 
laughing.

1979
01:25:15,181 --> 01:25:18,210
So I became like a class clown and just 
when I was like,

1980
01:25:18,211 --> 01:25:23,211
oh,
people like me now and I don't have to 

1981
01:25:23,211 --> 01:25:23,330
worry about them wondering what I am 
trying to put me in a box.

1982
01:25:23,331 --> 01:25:24,780
It's like I'm the funny one.
That's all the matter.

1983
01:25:24,910 --> 01:25:27,450
Oh yeah.
Interesting.

1984
01:25:28,530 --> 01:25:29,870
But my pain is not like a,
you know,

1985
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:31,470
there's mild pain.
It's a mile past.

1986
01:25:31,471 --> 01:25:33,630
That's exactly how he described it.
Cause a lot of comics were like,

1987
01:25:33,660 --> 01:25:36,210
oh it was molested by my father or 
somebody.

1988
01:25:36,211 --> 01:25:36,720
And it's like,
oh,

1989
01:25:36,721 --> 01:25:38,640
that's awful.
I'm sorry to hear that,

1990
01:25:38,641 --> 01:25:43,641
but that makes sense.
But yet people always come to me and 

1991
01:25:43,641 --> 01:25:43,641
they're like,
you don't have,

1992
01:25:43,641 --> 01:25:44,520
you're not addicted to anything.
Like you know what I mean?

1993
01:25:44,521 --> 01:25:47,220
Vices and you weren't like touched by an
uncle.

1994
01:25:47,340 --> 01:25:48,960
So like why are you funny?

1995
01:25:48,970 --> 01:25:51,150
And I was like,
well that's,

1996
01:25:52,140 --> 01:25:53,510
that was,
that's why I got plenty.

1997
01:25:53,880 --> 01:25:58,880
It was mild.
But when you first got on stage where 

1998
01:25:58,880 --> 01:25:58,880
you work and what we do for a living?

1999
01:25:58,880 --> 01:25:59,990
Yes.
Uh,

2000
01:26:00,030 --> 01:26:05,030
first got on stage.
I did have a day job at that time I was 

2001
01:26:05,030 --> 01:26:06,710
working.
Oh my God.

2002
01:26:06,711 --> 01:26:08,570
I had,
I've had a few jobs.

2003
01:26:08,571 --> 01:26:13,571
At one point I was working at Sylvan 
learning center and at one point I was 

2004
01:26:13,571 --> 01:26:16,850
working at it or doing tutoring.
I was a center director for a,

2005
01:26:16,870 --> 01:26:21,870
at Sylvan learning center at one point.
So I was in charge of the facility just 

2006
01:26:22,220 --> 01:26:25,130
for like where I was in Glendale and I 
was also in Santa Clarita.

2007
01:26:26,220 --> 01:26:27,260
Yeah.
But I wasn't,

2008
01:26:27,290 --> 01:26:32,290
I was an assistant at the assistant 
director at the Glendale and I was a 

2009
01:26:32,290 --> 01:26:33,080
full on center director at Santa 
Clarita.

2010
01:26:33,110 --> 01:26:35,180
But then after that I also worked at a 
nail salon.

2011
01:26:36,350 --> 01:26:38,300
I worked at a Vietnamese nail salon for 
a minute.

2012
01:26:38,510 --> 01:26:40,330
At the front desk.
Yeah.

2013
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:43,580
I worked in Toluca Lake Lake at a place 
called oasis nail spa.

2014
01:26:43,700 --> 01:26:48,700
Shout out to my,
all my Vietnamese nail technicians who 

2015
01:26:48,700 --> 01:26:48,700
still work there.

2016
01:26:48,700 --> 01:26:50,900
They were very nice and it's right next 
to Bob's big boy.

2017
01:26:51,470 --> 01:26:56,470
I used to work there.
I actually met a lot of people working 

2018
01:26:56,470 --> 01:26:59,141
there because it's by the studio.
So like George Lopez would come in 

2019
01:26:59,141 --> 01:27:00,280
there.
George Lopez was a little his whole.

2020
01:27:00,281 --> 01:27:05,281
Well when he was still married,
him and his wife and his daughter would 

2021
01:27:05,281 --> 01:27:05,281
come in.
Yeah.

2022
01:27:05,281 --> 01:27:06,890
So this was before he would drop them 
off.

2023
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:08,310
I think that's what it was.
Yeah.

2024
01:27:08,900 --> 01:27:10,350
But you know who did come and get his 
nails done?

2025
01:27:10,351 --> 01:27:13,040
David Allen greer with his.
His wife at the time.

2026
01:27:13,160 --> 01:27:14,970
They have since split as well.
That's a bad luck salon.

2027
01:27:14,971 --> 01:27:17,390
Has everyone that comes in there is very
get divorced.

2028
01:27:18,740 --> 01:27:21,380
I don't think it has to do with a salon 
or restaurant.

2029
01:27:21,890 --> 01:27:26,890
Of course.
It's the hard tissue being in a 

2030
01:27:26,890 --> 01:27:26,890
relationship.
You've managed to make it work.

2031
01:27:26,890 --> 01:27:27,000
It works.
You can make it work.

2032
01:27:27,090 --> 01:27:28,710
You can.
I think it just takes like.

2033
01:27:28,890 --> 01:27:31,350
But also I think it's the type of people
you are two.

2034
01:27:31,710 --> 01:27:34,290
Yeah.
One hundred percent or your parents

2035
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:40,440
still together?
My stepfather and my mother are still 

2036
01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:43,891
together.
They've been together since I was a 

2037
01:27:43,891 --> 01:27:43,891
little kid.
Oh Wow.

2038
01:27:43,891 --> 01:27:44,320
Okay.
So it's a successful relationship.

2039
01:27:44,340 --> 01:27:49,340
Yeah,
but it's one that started when I was 

2040
01:27:49,340 --> 01:27:49,340
five.
That's commitment,

2041
01:27:49,340 --> 01:27:49,460
but it works.
Yeah.

2042
01:27:49,710 --> 01:27:50,740
There.
They're very friendly.

2043
01:27:50,980 --> 01:27:53,350
They're very happy with each other,
very friendly to each other.

2044
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:55,840
So I grew up around that.
They were there.

2045
01:27:55,900 --> 01:28:00,900
They had a healthy relationship.
I saw terrible relationship with my 

2046
01:28:00,900 --> 01:28:00,910
mother and my father.
Terrible.

2047
01:28:01,060 --> 01:28:02,800
Briefly violent.
Oh Wow.

2048
01:28:02,860 --> 01:28:04,420
Dangerous.
Not Good.

2049
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:09,130
Then left that.
And then when we moved in with my,

2050
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:14,400
my mother's parents,
we lived there for awhile and then we 

2051
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:15,570
got an apartment after my mom had,
you know,

2052
01:28:15,730 --> 01:28:17,470
escape from my dad.
And then,

2053
01:28:17,471 --> 01:28:19,630
um,
when my mom met my Stepdad,

2054
01:28:20,630 --> 01:28:23,950
it was a totally different relationship.
He's a hippie and he was like,

2055
01:28:23,951 --> 01:28:26,230
this really nice guy.
He's into crystals and stuff.

2056
01:28:26,231 --> 01:28:27,100
No,
just,

2057
01:28:27,130 --> 01:28:28,540
he was just,
he was you.

2058
01:28:28,710 --> 01:28:32,320
He's an architect and he was just a 
different kind of guy.

2059
01:28:32,321 --> 01:28:33,730
Smoked Pot.
Had long hair.

2060
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:35,620
Yeah.
Just different kind of person.

2061
01:28:35,790 --> 01:28:37,550
Do you ever wonder about like how you 
would have like,

2062
01:28:37,560 --> 01:28:42,560
what your personnel would be like now if
your mom had stayed with your dad like 

2063
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:42,560
longer?

2064
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:43,300
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

2065
01:28:43,301 --> 01:28:44,920
That wouldn't have been good.
I would've,

2066
01:28:44,950 --> 01:28:46,840
I would've been a dangerous person.
Yeah.

2067
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:48,400
Yeah,
for sure.

2068
01:28:48,550 --> 01:28:49,660
I,
I carry,

2069
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:51,580
you know,
I have a,

2070
01:28:51,970 --> 01:28:56,970
I mean I don't have a tendency towards 
violence because I'm not a violent 

2071
01:28:56,970 --> 01:28:57,670
person in terms of like actual my actual
actions.

2072
01:28:58,060 --> 01:29:00,790
But I understand it.
Like gets there.

2073
01:29:00,820 --> 01:29:05,820
It's always there.
I just don't let it out of the box and 

2074
01:29:05,820 --> 01:29:06,990
that's why I got into fighting.
And that's why martial arts.

2075
01:29:06,991 --> 01:29:07,970
Yeah.
Oh my God.

2076
01:29:07,971 --> 01:29:09,360
It changed my life,
like having,

2077
01:29:09,450 --> 01:29:12,850
I think for every boy,
especially every boy that grew up,

2078
01:29:12,851 --> 01:29:14,290
I mean obviously,
um,

2079
01:29:14,610 --> 01:29:16,830
situations could have been way worse 
than mine.

2080
01:29:16,831 --> 01:29:18,930
Mine wasn't the worst.
Nobody beat me.

2081
01:29:19,180 --> 01:29:23,040
I wasn't terrible in terms of like,
I didn't get abused,

2082
01:29:23,460 --> 01:29:27,990
but I saw it and I saw a lot of.
I saw plenty of violence,

2083
01:29:28,050 --> 01:29:31,710
so it's like I knew it was a thing and 
if I grew up around it,

2084
01:29:31,711 --> 01:29:33,150
it would eventually started to affect 
me.

2085
01:29:33,150 --> 01:29:34,510
And I would have been a part of it,
right,

2086
01:29:34,740 --> 01:29:37,080
for sure.
And the problem is you mirror that,

2087
01:29:37,110 --> 01:29:42,110
you know,
like the guys who grow up with dads who 

2088
01:29:42,110 --> 01:29:44,880
beat their mom are way more likely to 
beat their wives or their girlfriends or

2089
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:45,740
you know,
or,

2090
01:29:46,290 --> 01:29:51,290
or maybe the opposite,
maybe just hate it so much because 

2091
01:29:51,290 --> 01:29:52,230
you've seen it that you would never 
allow it.

2092
01:29:52,231 --> 01:29:54,240
But,
but um,

2093
01:29:54,540 --> 01:29:59,540
I think for young men like having some 
sort of a vent something martial arts 

2094
01:30:01,560 --> 01:30:06,560
especially because you,
you could actually get out the violence 

2095
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:08,100
were you purge it from your system.
You don't have to think about it anymore

2096
01:30:08,580 --> 01:30:09,240
as giant.

2097
01:30:09,990 --> 01:30:12,870
Is it really because I have no idea what
it's like to be a man.

2098
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:14,690
You know,
I don't,

2099
01:30:14,820 --> 01:30:19,820
I,
I think I do have a decent amount of 

2100
01:30:19,820 --> 01:30:23,571
testosterone for a woman because I was a
tomboy when I was a little girl and I 

2101
01:30:23,571 --> 01:30:26,340
was never into like dresses and stuff 
like that when I was younger.

2102
01:30:26,341 --> 01:30:30,660
I never like envision like getting 
married and having this huge wedding.

2103
01:30:30,661 --> 01:30:32,490
Those weren't my fantasies when I was a 
kid,

2104
01:30:32,550 --> 01:30:33,990
you know?
And whenever it was Halloween,

2105
01:30:33,991 --> 01:30:38,991
I would dress up as a boy,
I would be like Count Dracula and my 

2106
01:30:38,991 --> 01:30:39,510
sister would be a princess and I'd be 
like the hulk.

2107
01:30:41,370 --> 01:30:46,370
So I've always been kind of like,
I've always gravitated towards a more 

2108
01:30:46,370 --> 01:30:47,970
masculine even doing standup.
It's a very masculine thing to do.

2109
01:30:48,160 --> 01:30:49,980
And maybe that's why I tried gay dudes 
too.

2110
01:30:49,981 --> 01:30:51,960
But anyway,
that's neither here nor there.

2111
01:30:52,890 --> 01:30:57,890
So is it like hard,
like are you guys constantly fighting 

2112
01:30:57,890 --> 01:31:00,340
the urge to be violent?
Because I don't know.

2113
01:31:00,341 --> 01:31:00,610
No,
not

2114
01:31:00,670 --> 01:31:03,970
constantly.
This is how I looked at it.

2115
01:31:04,050 --> 01:31:05,470
This is kind of a weird way of looking 
at it,

2116
01:31:05,471 --> 01:31:09,610
but this is the way I look at it.
I think that every man,

2117
01:31:10,210 --> 01:31:15,040
every man who has a functional endocrine
system was testosterone,

2118
01:31:15,041 --> 01:31:18,460
has been involved in sports who is 
fairly athletic.

2119
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:22,180
There's violence in your head.
So if your head was a house,

2120
01:31:22,300 --> 01:31:23,680
okay,
there's a room,

2121
01:31:23,681 --> 01:31:25,080
there's a violence room,
okay?

2122
01:31:25,420 --> 01:31:28,000
And you can open up that door there.
That door gets opened.

2123
01:31:28,270 --> 01:31:31,120
Crazy shit can happen.
Most of the time that door's closed,

2124
01:31:31,540 --> 01:31:35,020
but the more fucked up things that 
happen in your life,

2125
01:31:35,080 --> 01:31:38,800
the more your house gets rocked,
the more your foundation gets fucked up,

2126
01:31:38,801 --> 01:31:42,370
the more your joy start to creak and 
move left and right,

2127
01:31:42,371 --> 01:31:47,080
and things are off center and off plum.
Then that door opens way easier.

2128
01:31:47,290 --> 01:31:50,530
That door is leaking that doors like 
there's gaps.

2129
01:31:50,650 --> 01:31:53,650
Like the framing is not so good.
Right?

2130
01:31:53,730 --> 01:31:55,090
Yeah.
The hinges are loose.

2131
01:31:55,170 --> 01:32:00,170
Right.
And so for someone who's been around a 

2132
01:32:00,170 --> 01:32:00,170
lot of violence,
like people grew up in a neighborhoods,

2133
01:32:00,170 --> 01:32:02,170
been involved in gang violence,
that kind of shit.

2134
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:06,370
That door is always ready to pop open.
It's just always ready to open.

2135
01:32:06,580 --> 01:32:09,740
Whereas someone who grew up,
like my friend todd,

2136
01:32:09,750 --> 01:32:12,180
like one of the nicest guys,
super sweet guy,

2137
01:32:12,220 --> 01:32:15,460
couldn't imagine a beating anybody up 
because he was loved.

2138
01:32:15,610 --> 01:32:17,650
Like maybe even too much.
Like it's all love.

2139
01:32:17,900 --> 01:32:22,900
So his door is locked up tight.
He would need to get the key from his 

2140
01:32:22,900 --> 01:32:23,150
mom.
He's gonna get in there.

2141
01:32:23,570 --> 01:32:25,730
Whereas I have other friends where they 
fucking.

2142
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:27,860
If you're brush up against that too 
much.

2143
01:32:27,861 --> 01:32:29,600
Yeah.
Like Joey Diaz,

2144
01:32:29,870 --> 01:32:30,730
Joey Diaz,
if you,

2145
01:32:31,410 --> 01:32:36,410
if you knock on that door when he was 
fucking punch you in that violence ready

2146
01:32:39,411 --> 01:32:44,411
to go and he doesn't do much,
but if it happens,

2147
01:32:45,080 --> 01:32:48,500
if the wrong thing happens,
that door comes swinging open,

2148
01:32:48,920 --> 01:32:50,480
you know,
we don't teach,

2149
01:32:50,840 --> 01:32:53,510
we don't teach kids how to deal with 
their emotions properly.

2150
01:32:53,610 --> 01:32:56,450
And did you see that?
The Mr Rogers documentary?

2151
01:32:56,480 --> 01:32:56,820
No.

2152
01:32:58,070 --> 01:33:00,140
So there's only so many things you could
see.

2153
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:05,200
Well you can take your kids to see this.
I'm in the middle of watching that wild 

2154
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:05,200
wild country.
Oh,

2155
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:07,760
I've already seen that.
How good of cults.

2156
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:13,700
Now it's a cult sex cults because I had 
a course.

2157
01:33:16,550 --> 01:33:19,460
What the fuck's the point number called 
get some pussy.

2158
01:33:20,050 --> 01:33:22,100
My coat would be a sex cult because 
you're a girl.

2159
01:33:23,210 --> 01:33:28,210
What would you call me?
What was the last time a girl ran a 

2160
01:33:28,210 --> 01:33:28,210
call?
By the way?

2161
01:33:28,210 --> 01:33:28,210
It might be the first.
Well,

2162
01:33:28,210 --> 01:33:28,370
that noble,
the chick who was,

2163
01:33:28,430 --> 01:33:33,380
she was kind of running that on her own.
That bitch has lost.

2164
01:33:33,410 --> 01:33:35,270
Okay.
Yeah,

2165
01:33:35,271 --> 01:33:40,271
I guess so.
But she was running stuff while she was 

2166
01:33:40,271 --> 01:33:40,271
there because I do never left his room.
Yeah.

2167
01:33:40,271 --> 01:33:44,230
But Sheila was only empower because of 
homeboy wasn't even Osho.

2168
01:33:44,260 --> 01:33:48,100
How do you say that?
That's what he was called after A.

2169
01:33:48,530 --> 01:33:49,790
Yeah.
I don't remember his name is.

2170
01:33:49,940 --> 01:33:53,510
That would without him and his.
He had to look.

2171
01:33:53,511 --> 01:33:58,511
You got to have that look.
You got to love the look of the holy 

2172
01:33:58,511 --> 01:33:58,511
man.
That's crazy.

2173
01:33:58,511 --> 01:34:01,460
Beard and you have to drive around in 
Bentleys,

2174
01:34:01,490 --> 01:34:04,100
Rolls Royces.
And that's what was crazy.

2175
01:34:06,720 --> 01:34:08,520
These luxurious cars.
Do you need.

2176
01:34:08,890 --> 01:34:12,140
Why do you need 22 of the same?
That's piss poor choices.

2177
01:34:12,330 --> 01:34:13,810
No,
I don't understand that at the time.

2178
01:34:13,880 --> 01:34:15,320
Mercedes,
what'd you say?

2179
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:18,370
Try Mercedes or Rolls Royce.
It's something different.

2180
01:34:18,780 --> 01:34:22,130
It's very vicious.
And my question is like,

2181
01:34:22,131 --> 01:34:22,900
do these people,
when you,

2182
01:34:22,970 --> 01:34:27,970
when you're going into a cult,
do they know it's a cult or do they 

2183
01:34:27,970 --> 01:34:29,480
think it's literally like a legit 
religious organization that they're just

2184
01:34:29,481 --> 01:34:30,050
doing it.
They

2185
01:34:30,050 --> 01:34:32,690
think it's a legit movement,
you know,

2186
01:34:32,691 --> 01:34:33,890
like what is a cult,
right?

2187
01:34:33,891 --> 01:34:37,280
Because Christianity has often led by 
scholars refer to as a cult.

2188
01:34:37,820 --> 01:34:42,820
You know,
like there's certain documentaries on 

2189
01:34:42,820 --> 01:34:42,820
Christianity that refer to is a cult of 
Christianity.

2190
01:34:42,820 --> 01:34:47,350
Like go what?
A cult is a group of people that follow 

2191
01:34:47,350 --> 01:34:50,230
an ideology.
They follow a certain way in pattern of 

2192
01:34:50,230 --> 01:34:53,441
being.
So these people are doing that exact 

2193
01:34:53,441 --> 01:34:56,180
same thing until someone from like the 
fucking FBI starts calling it a cult.

2194
01:34:56,720 --> 01:34:57,530
Like you don't

2195
01:34:58,290 --> 01:35:03,290
know what it is.
I got a red flag would be is if like,

2196
01:35:04,390 --> 01:35:06,500
because you know though is if your 
leader is fucking,

2197
01:35:06,650 --> 01:35:11,420
you know,
like that to me is a red flag because if

2198
01:35:11,421 --> 01:35:16,421
you look at,
if you look at religious organizations 

2199
01:35:16,421 --> 01:35:18,970
in general,
like the one thing that's frowned upon 

2200
01:35:18,970 --> 01:35:21,281
and like all of them is like too much 
sex or any sex really any type of like 

2201
01:35:21,281 --> 01:35:21,710
promiscuity.
So like,

2202
01:35:22,070 --> 01:35:24,740
and that's a car I think across the 
board with religions just in general.

2203
01:35:24,920 --> 01:35:26,810
None of them were like this is good.
They're like,

2204
01:35:26,811 --> 01:35:31,811
you should have sex to procreate.
And like that's it with the person that 

2205
01:35:31,811 --> 01:35:31,811
you're married to.
But with that they were,

2206
01:35:31,811 --> 01:35:35,060
they were like this group sex.
Like I think we might be in the cult,

2207
01:35:36,020 --> 01:35:37,130
you know,
that's a huge red flag.

2208
01:35:37,970 --> 01:35:40,520
As soon as the dude starts fucking 
everybody's watching and you're like,

2209
01:35:40,521 --> 01:35:42,290
wait a second,
how can we get so fucked?

2210
01:35:42,291 --> 01:35:47,291
My wife,
she's got a direct line to Jesus that 

2211
01:35:50,750 --> 01:35:52,670
wouldn't trust that.
That is the thing though.

2212
01:35:52,671 --> 01:35:56,840
But that's the thing with men like men,
when they get into power,

2213
01:35:57,140 --> 01:36:02,140
anytime a man runs a giant organization,
has all these followers and he gets to 

2214
01:36:02,331 --> 01:36:07,170
stand on to a stage out in a grassy 
field filled with people,

2215
01:36:07,340 --> 01:36:09,800
bowing to him,
that guy's going to get his dick sucked.

2216
01:36:09,860 --> 01:36:10,760
Absolutely.
He's,

2217
01:36:11,780 --> 01:36:14,790
he's got beads on and everyone was like,
oh sure,

2218
01:36:16,930 --> 01:36:21,260
yes.
Come come at him.

2219
01:36:21,470 --> 01:36:25,220
You can drive rolls Royce number 17.
Come on for the ride.

2220
01:36:27,460 --> 01:36:31,450
So do you trust like Joel Osteen?
O'Steen a,

2221
01:36:31,580 --> 01:36:34,770
trust him.
How do you think he's like a man?

2222
01:36:35,830 --> 01:36:37,270
He tell me he's not trusting.
No,

2223
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:38,540
just kidding.
I was like,

2224
01:36:38,541 --> 01:36:40,760
Oh shit guy.
Any money?

2225
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:43,570
The rich as fuck.
I was like,

2226
01:36:43,580 --> 01:36:45,320
well this was this.
He had a kickstarter.

2227
01:36:45,780 --> 01:36:48,530
Well,
he is absolutely a.

2228
01:36:48,680 --> 01:36:52,050
because he's in that celebrity level.
He's on TV,

2229
01:36:52,490 --> 01:36:54,020
he's a.
he's a shyster,

2230
01:36:54,260 --> 01:36:56,420
thorough shysters.
Just that's what they are.

2231
01:36:56,790 --> 01:37:01,790
Dresses real nice.
He talks about Jesus and he gets people 

2232
01:37:01,790 --> 01:37:03,230
excited and they give him their money.
They give him their money.

2233
01:37:03,231 --> 01:37:08,231
That's what he wants and he's got 
fucking millions of getting panties 

2234
01:37:08,231 --> 01:37:09,590
thrown at him.
Didn't get you just get divorced.

2235
01:37:10,090 --> 01:37:12,590
Did you get divorced?
Google.

2236
01:37:12,591 --> 01:37:15,950
That is probably good and some serious 
God loving.

2237
01:37:16,940 --> 01:37:19,850
Oh yeah.
He's got a direct line to God.

2238
01:37:20,240 --> 01:37:23,480
Jesus said Jesus to blast from this.

2239
01:37:25,370 --> 01:37:30,370
Tell me what job said.
I'll tell you what show is that 

2240
01:37:30,370 --> 01:37:30,980
blasphemous?
No,

2241
01:37:30,981 --> 01:37:32,990
it's like he's a leader.
You know what I mean?

2242
01:37:33,070 --> 01:37:37,790
That here's if it's long as it's 
obvious,

2243
01:37:37,820 --> 01:37:42,770
like is a con bad?
If it's real obvious to his followers,

2244
01:37:42,771 --> 01:37:46,040
he is not a calm though to us.
It's like Duh.

2245
01:37:46,640 --> 01:37:48,350
But like you were talking about with the
colts when you're in it,

2246
01:37:48,410 --> 01:37:50,000
it's like,
I don't think they can see it,

2247
01:37:50,150 --> 01:37:53,100
but like Jim Baker,
like people that fall back,

2248
01:37:53,440 --> 01:37:58,440
but he's still around selling food for 
people that scared the world's going to 

2249
01:37:58,440 --> 01:37:59,010
end.
He sells buckets of food,

2250
01:37:59,120 --> 01:38:00,510
but Tammy Faye died.
She died,

2251
01:38:00,511 --> 01:38:03,540
she died.
Was Tammy Faye long suffering?

2252
01:38:03,541 --> 01:38:06,060
Tammy Faye.
She died from diet coke.

2253
01:38:06,120 --> 01:38:07,790
Diet coke did.
Are you serious?

2254
01:38:07,830 --> 01:38:10,260
That's what they think.
She drank too much to it all day.

2255
01:38:10,510 --> 01:38:11,970
Everyday.
That's stuff's addictive.

2256
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:14,380
It is addictive.
There's something there.

2257
01:38:14,381 --> 01:38:16,100
There have been studies that have proven
that there's a.

2258
01:38:16,110 --> 01:38:18,480
whatever that artificial sweetener is 
that they put in there.

2259
01:38:18,510 --> 01:38:19,050
Yeah,
they,

2260
01:38:19,051 --> 01:38:19,450
it's,
uh,

2261
01:38:19,510 --> 01:38:24,510
it causes you to Jesus.
Jesus and Jim Beggars Dick.

2262
01:38:25,860 --> 01:38:30,860
Both those things are addictive.
It's Jim Baker was like a perfect 

2263
01:38:31,201 --> 01:38:33,000
example though.
If you're so fucking stupid,

2264
01:38:33,001 --> 01:38:35,400
you buy into that Guy Shit.
Remember,

2265
01:38:35,530 --> 01:38:36,980
lose all of it.
I don't remember him.

2266
01:38:37,120 --> 01:38:42,120
I remember them.
I remember growing up and watching like 

2267
01:38:42,120 --> 01:38:44,120
sketches on mad tv or whatever,
where they will be making fun of him.

2268
01:38:44,650 --> 01:38:47,200
He's a guy that his hair slicked back.
He's another late night guy.

2269
01:38:47,201 --> 01:38:49,980
He would talk in tongues,
be on TV.

2270
01:38:50,200 --> 01:38:55,200
Oh,
the Lord is moving me to speech some 

2271
01:38:55,200 --> 01:38:55,440
blah,
blah,

2272
01:38:55,470 --> 01:38:55,780
blah,
blah.

2273
01:38:56,100 --> 01:38:59,010
He would speak in tongues.
This is one thing you said.

2274
01:38:59,830 --> 01:39:01,530
I was listening to what?
I started fucking crying,

2275
01:39:01,531 --> 01:39:02,100
laughing.
He said,

2276
01:39:02,310 --> 01:39:05,280
every time you write a check to me,
Satan gets a black guy.

2277
01:39:06,060 --> 01:39:09,150
Now he does.
He say that every time you write a check

2278
01:39:09,151 --> 01:39:11,380
to me,
Satan gets a black eye.

2279
01:39:17,200 --> 01:39:20,610
That kinda shit laughed.
That shit should totally be legal.

2280
01:39:21,650 --> 01:39:23,540
You're so stupid.
You're like,

2281
01:39:23,590 --> 01:39:25,130
holy site.
Nah,

2282
01:39:25,131 --> 01:39:27,700
smite the you pull out your checkbook.
Gosh,

2283
01:39:27,720 --> 01:39:31,220
my new or fiction again.
A shanor.

2284
01:39:31,850 --> 01:39:32,820
There he is.
Look at him.

2285
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,940
He's got to speak in tongues here.
Gave me this message.

2286
01:39:35,970 --> 01:39:39,960
I don't remember.
This guy have said they're hilarious.

2287
01:39:40,200 --> 01:39:42,240
He's hilarious man.
The devil last shit.

2288
01:39:42,250 --> 01:39:45,810
And they gave me this mess.
I'm say 10 the devil.

2289
01:39:45,811 --> 01:39:50,040
I shouldn't have said that.
That was just him.

2290
01:39:50,340 --> 01:39:53,970
He um,
he speaks in tongues and when he.

2291
01:39:54,030 --> 01:39:56,420
Is He really old looking though.
Was that him?

2292
01:39:56,430 --> 01:39:58,720
That him there,
Tom.

2293
01:39:58,750 --> 01:40:03,750
Such a cruel bitch.
Even Robert Tilden went down with all 

2294
01:40:03,750 --> 01:40:03,750
his money,
but he's still alive.

2295
01:40:03,750 --> 01:40:03,930
Huh?
Probably.

2296
01:40:06,270 --> 01:40:08,370
But what do you wolfen he's old as fuck 
now.

2297
01:40:08,820 --> 01:40:09,370
Oh,
Jesus.

2298
01:40:10,250 --> 01:40:12,060
I can't be the same guy.
Not Him.

2299
01:40:12,330 --> 01:40:15,000
It is him.
Go.

2300
01:40:15,030 --> 01:40:18,900
What happened then?
That video boy,

2301
01:40:19,560 --> 01:40:22,830
all the whiskey and pussy and coke.
Look at him.

2302
01:40:22,860 --> 01:40:25,630
He looks doing coke for Jesus.
No,

2303
01:40:25,670 --> 01:40:26,250
no,
no.

2304
01:40:27,450 --> 01:40:28,470
We done.
We wrapped.

2305
01:40:28,471 --> 01:40:30,780
We were gold underwear.
Ooh.

2306
01:40:31,060 --> 01:40:33,990
Someone trustworthy jumps in a private 
jet.

2307
01:40:34,500 --> 01:40:39,500
15 hookers in there waiting for them so 
it touches down to shoot the hookers.

2308
01:40:43,320 --> 01:40:46,150
You know too much.
Stop it.

2309
01:40:46,160 --> 01:40:47,380
Did they remix it?
Yeah,

2310
01:40:47,540 --> 01:40:51,060
it's a remix of him.
Why are they remix and stuff anymore?

2311
01:40:51,061 --> 01:40:51,830
I know,
right?

2312
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:54,060
You remember that.
I was

2313
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:57,330
just going to say they're not doing that
anymore.

2314
01:40:57,360 --> 01:40:58,990
That guy,
I met,

2315
01:40:58,991 --> 01:41:00,280
that guy,
he came to UFC.

2316
01:41:00,370 --> 01:41:02,140
Shut up.
Dave did.

2317
01:41:02,550 --> 01:41:04,420
Didn't get paid.
They made like a million dollars off.

2318
01:41:04,421 --> 01:41:05,560
That song.
Made some money.

2319
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,350
He made some money and Dana white 
brought them to a UFC.

2320
01:41:10,290 --> 01:41:12,010
Is this because he was gay?
Right?

2321
01:41:12,100 --> 01:41:15,310
And then then went to church and said he
wasn't gay anymore.

2322
01:41:15,670 --> 01:41:20,670
He was ashamed of being gay.
It was very sad because he was saying 

2323
01:41:20,670 --> 01:41:20,670
that,
you know,

2324
01:41:20,670 --> 01:41:21,780
he was ashamed of being gay in,
you know,

2325
01:41:21,820 --> 01:41:24,970
the church was going to say we're going 
to pray the gay away.

2326
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,060
It's one of them deals.
So that's a.

2327
01:41:27,080 --> 01:41:29,150
That to me makes me so sad.
It does.

2328
01:41:29,230 --> 01:41:34,230
It's,
there's nothing wrong with being gay 

2329
01:41:34,230 --> 01:41:34,230
and,
and this,

2330
01:41:34,230 --> 01:41:36,490
this idea that you could change someone 
from being gay,

2331
01:41:36,491 --> 01:41:37,880
so fucking stupid.
It's like,

2332
01:41:37,930 --> 01:41:38,940
just be gay.

2333
01:41:39,180 --> 01:41:40,540
You're gay.
It's all right.

2334
01:41:40,690 --> 01:41:45,690
It's okay.
You just need better people around you 

2335
01:41:45,690 --> 01:41:46,190
that tell you you're okay.
Yeah.

2336
01:41:46,560 --> 01:41:49,090
And that it's okay to just find other 
gay people and you're like,

2337
01:41:49,091 --> 01:41:49,900
oh,
you're like me,

2338
01:41:49,901 --> 01:41:51,010
but good.
Yeah,

2339
01:41:51,011 --> 01:41:51,910
you're good.
You're fine.

2340
01:41:51,911 --> 01:41:53,170
You guys are going to be fun.
Oh,

2341
01:41:53,171 --> 01:41:56,850
you need to do is move to Atlanta or 
anywhere else where the skilled people,

2342
01:41:56,950 --> 01:41:58,230
La and La,
you know,

2343
01:41:58,270 --> 01:42:00,670
find a gay can still be in the closet 
out here too.

2344
01:42:01,180 --> 01:42:04,000
There's a lot of people in the closet on
here and I don't get it.

2345
01:42:04,030 --> 01:42:06,940
There's people in show business that I 
know they're in the closet man,

2346
01:42:07,580 --> 01:42:10,380
that God damn closet.
You have a new fan base,

2347
01:42:11,030 --> 01:42:16,030
the fan base.
And then when you meet guys like todd 

2348
01:42:16,030 --> 01:42:16,030
glass who didn't get it out of the 
closet,

2349
01:42:16,031 --> 01:42:17,860
it was so much happier.
Now he's like,

2350
01:42:17,861 --> 01:42:19,090
it's just a giant burden.

2351
01:42:19,090 --> 01:42:21,040
Relieved,
relieved off my back.

2352
01:42:21,400 --> 01:42:22,150
Like,
yeah,

2353
01:42:22,220 --> 01:42:25,050
just be yourself man.
And you know,

2354
01:42:26,830 --> 01:42:29,520
plus it's,
the stigma is so it's,

2355
01:42:29,550 --> 01:42:32,620
it's bad for everybody.
It's bad for gay people.

2356
01:42:32,621 --> 01:42:36,130
It's bad for straight people because 
it's even bad for people were homophobes

2357
01:42:36,340 --> 01:42:38,260
because they don't realize how many 
people are really gay.

2358
01:42:38,710 --> 01:42:40,240
And if they did they would probably be 
like,

2359
01:42:40,540 --> 01:42:42,460
maybe this is normal.
It is normal.

2360
01:42:42,461 --> 01:42:43,230
Yes.
Yeah,

2361
01:42:43,231 --> 01:42:48,231
it's the beginning of time.
It's no different than having blue eyes 

2362
01:42:48,231 --> 01:42:49,270
or black hair or whatever the fuck.
Yes.

2363
01:42:49,480 --> 01:42:51,650
Trust me,
my dogs K is fuck yeah.

2364
01:42:51,670 --> 01:42:55,290
He looks at my other dogs Dick.
Every time my poor marshall,

2365
01:42:55,470 --> 01:42:56,800
every.
I'm throwing them under the bus.

2366
01:42:58,810 --> 01:43:00,940
Well Johnny cash my masters when he,
he'll,

2367
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:06,000
he'll take a leak.
Marshall come over and lick his dick 

2368
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:06,000
right after it takes a little.
I'm like,

2369
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,050
get the fuck away from his Dick,
man.

2370
01:43:08,410 --> 01:43:13,410
Stop doing that dude.
So depressing gets right up in there 

2371
01:43:13,410 --> 01:43:15,430
instantly.
How many dogs do you have?

2372
01:43:15,460 --> 01:43:16,100
Three.
Three.

2373
01:43:16,750 --> 01:43:19,300
Two of them are on death's door though.
Very,

2374
01:43:19,301 --> 01:43:21,010
very old.
They're ready to go.

2375
01:43:21,040 --> 01:43:23,350
Do you recommend getting a dog?
I love dogs.

2376
01:43:23,460 --> 01:43:24,640
I love them too.
I just never,

2377
01:43:24,650 --> 01:43:29,650
not had a lot of work.
I know I've had dogs since I had enough 

2378
01:43:29,650 --> 01:43:33,091
money to have dogs.
The moment when I moved to La and I had 

2379
01:43:33,091 --> 01:43:33,091
a sitcom,
I'm like,

2380
01:43:33,091 --> 01:43:33,490
okay,
I'll pay my rent.

2381
01:43:33,491 --> 01:43:35,620
I'm getting a dog.
I love dogs.

2382
01:43:35,740 --> 01:43:38,270
I just want to make sure that I'd be 
able to have like A.

2383
01:43:38,290 --> 01:43:43,290
I don't want to have to burden somebody 
when I go out of town to the places we 

2384
01:43:43,290 --> 01:43:44,380
can go that are really good to take care
of.

2385
01:43:44,440 --> 01:43:49,440
They'll even trained your dog white and 
while they have them so bad you get a 

2386
01:43:49,440 --> 01:43:50,590
dog girl.
You'll figure to have a dog.

2387
01:43:50,890 --> 01:43:52,850
He gonna get out of.
First of all,

2388
01:43:52,851 --> 01:43:55,430
when I came here you said,
I looked like I have a kid.

2389
01:43:55,850 --> 01:43:56,600
No,
I start.

2390
01:43:56,601 --> 01:43:58,190
You know,
I said it.

2391
01:43:58,460 --> 01:44:02,630
I think somebody brought it up.
Somebody said candice has a child.

2392
01:44:02,720 --> 01:44:04,220
I think someone said it was probably 
some grow.

2393
01:44:04,221 --> 01:44:06,560
Hated on.
You probably know the bus.

2394
01:44:08,030 --> 01:44:09,360
Tennis as a kid at home.

2395
01:44:14,120 --> 01:44:18,830
Even know where I got it from.
Somebody brought in a dog cage.

2396
01:44:19,070 --> 01:44:24,050
That's why I asked.
You don't know who would be very good at

2397
01:44:24,200 --> 01:44:26,030
taking care of a dog.
What kind of dog would you get?

2398
01:44:26,460 --> 01:44:29,000
I like really small or really big like 
and,

2399
01:44:29,001 --> 01:44:30,170
but my,
my place that I have,

2400
01:44:30,171 --> 01:44:33,940
I have a nice sized place but I still 
would like to have property when I have,

2401
01:44:33,980 --> 01:44:38,980
if I have a big dog,
so I would probably want a smaller one 

2402
01:44:38,980 --> 01:44:38,980
just for the sake of,
you know,

2403
01:44:39,020 --> 01:44:41,540
it's limited.
So I really,

2404
01:44:41,541 --> 01:44:44,630
um,
I really do like a pugs.

2405
01:44:44,750 --> 01:44:47,150
Are you friends with Whitney Cummings?
I'm not friends with her.

2406
01:44:47,151 --> 01:44:47,960
We've met,
but I,

2407
01:44:48,150 --> 01:44:50,480
I can't say we're friends and talked to 
her about dogs.

2408
01:44:50,481 --> 01:44:52,910
She's got a shitload of them that 
pitches a horse.

2409
01:44:54,320 --> 01:44:55,330
She got a horse.
Well wait,

2410
01:44:55,340 --> 01:44:57,350
what do you mean she has like that?

2411
01:44:57,900 --> 01:45:00,170
You know,
I get the horse part,

2412
01:45:00,380 --> 01:45:01,840
but you said she has a dog.
She goes,

2413
01:45:02,610 --> 01:45:03,980
no,
look,

2414
01:45:04,150 --> 01:45:08,990
she's,
she's very smart and I'll go to her.

2415
01:45:08,991 --> 01:45:11,960
Talked to her about dark questions.
She gave me what you're saying,

2416
01:45:12,050 --> 01:45:13,670
like how to deal with dogs.
Like you know what she said.

2417
01:45:13,910 --> 01:45:14,780
She goes,
she goes,

2418
01:45:14,781 --> 01:45:15,980
first of all,
she talks to you like that.

2419
01:45:16,020 --> 01:45:16,670
She was,
first of all,

2420
01:45:17,330 --> 01:45:18,740
I'm in charge of my house.
She goes,

2421
01:45:18,741 --> 01:45:21,110
I don't walk around my dogs.
I walk through them.

2422
01:45:21,200 --> 01:45:22,400
She was like,
I'm the Alpha.

2423
01:45:22,610 --> 01:45:24,830
She goes,
they don't get to get on top of me.

2424
01:45:24,831 --> 01:45:27,050
They don't climb on top of me.
They don't kiss my face.

2425
01:45:27,230 --> 01:45:30,050
She goes,
I'm in my bed.

2426
01:45:30,150 --> 01:45:30,920
Yeah.
Yeah.

2427
01:45:31,370 --> 01:45:32,310
You don't have to have that,
you know.

2428
01:45:32,450 --> 01:45:34,670
But I know so many people think I'm 
weird because I wouldn't want my dog and

2429
01:45:34,671 --> 01:45:35,010
my bags.

2430
01:45:35,010 --> 01:45:37,990
Whitney's dogs.
She loves pits.

2431
01:45:38,370 --> 01:45:43,310
She does.
That's adorable.

2432
01:45:45,180 --> 01:45:47,960
That's a cute little tiny one too.
What does that little one?

2433
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:49,970
What is that?
Hold on.

2434
01:45:50,240 --> 01:45:51,470
Oh,
little bulldog.

2435
01:45:52,760 --> 01:45:53,330
Yeah.
I like,

2436
01:45:53,331 --> 01:45:55,820
I like bulldogs.
I like French bulldogs.

2437
01:45:55,940 --> 01:45:58,190
Um,
but I'm also one of those ones that like

2438
01:45:58,191 --> 01:46:00,530
those little tiny ones that probably 
annoy you.

2439
01:46:00,650 --> 01:46:03,470
I like little dogs to you and like your 
keys.

2440
01:46:03,560 --> 01:46:06,690
I like 'em.
I like Pomeranians,

2441
01:46:06,860 --> 01:46:10,680
like dogs in general.
Only dogs I feel bad for.

2442
01:46:10,681 --> 01:46:14,210
Or those bulldogs with those fat faces 
that can't walk and they can't breathe.

2443
01:46:15,120 --> 01:46:17,900
Pugs are like that too.
They have nasal problems.

2444
01:46:18,210 --> 01:46:19,970
They're so cute.
The fuck.

2445
01:46:19,971 --> 01:46:20,800
Did you do this?
Yeah.

2446
01:46:20,820 --> 01:46:22,430
They looked like I got punched in the 
face,

2447
01:46:22,520 --> 01:46:24,110
but they're so cute.
It's depressing.

2448
01:46:24,420 --> 01:46:25,640
It's from all the breeding,
right?

2449
01:46:25,641 --> 01:46:27,230
Isn't that how they got like.
Yeah.

2450
01:46:27,500 --> 01:46:32,500
Well they've made them that way on 
purpose because they want their face to 

2451
01:46:32,500 --> 01:46:33,630
be flattened out.
So they've bred to that characteristic,

2452
01:46:34,290 --> 01:46:35,840
Huh?
Yeah.

2453
01:46:36,980 --> 01:46:41,980
Good dog.
Get them in Kansas and I'm not getting 

2454
01:46:41,980 --> 01:46:45,371
both.
No more realistic for me than getting a 

2455
01:46:45,371 --> 01:46:49,631
band.
Get a dog and then you have a man and 

2456
01:46:49,631 --> 01:46:49,631
you go,
well this is one.

2457
01:46:49,631 --> 01:46:50,100
Too many things are going to kill.
This dog would kill the man

2458
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:55,100
for 100 percent.
Alright.

2459
01:46:57,680 --> 01:46:58,830
Qantas,
we're going to wrap this up.

2460
01:46:59,340 --> 01:47:02,400
Anything else to say to the people their
first introduction to you?

2461
01:47:02,670 --> 01:47:06,840
I'm on my first introduction.
I think this one wheel well.

2462
01:47:06,900 --> 01:47:09,690
We're getting to know one another and 
talked about doing this for awhile.

2463
01:47:09,720 --> 01:47:12,150
I'm glad we finally did it.
We did make it happen.

2464
01:47:12,151 --> 01:47:14,550
Now you're going to come and do my 
podcast in Kansas.

2465
01:47:14,570 --> 01:47:16,740
When you're at the comedy store,
when are you on the tour?

2466
01:47:17,140 --> 01:47:22,140
When?
Where can people go see you just go to 

2467
01:47:22,140 --> 01:47:22,140
Qantas Thompson comedy.com.
I'll put a post on my dates.

2468
01:47:22,140 --> 01:47:24,510
If you're going to do jfl this year in 
Montreal,

2469
01:47:24,660 --> 01:47:29,660
it's going to be in Canada.
Believe on the 26th of July.

2470
01:47:29,940 --> 01:47:30,680
Twenty six,
27,

2471
01:47:30,690 --> 01:47:32,670
28.
Are you doing the gala,

2472
01:47:33,210 --> 01:47:35,130
the gala?
Oh No.

2473
01:47:35,160 --> 01:47:38,550
I don't think I am the TV thing that 
they do.

2474
01:47:38,551 --> 01:47:39,300
The giant.
Yeah.

2475
01:47:39,301 --> 01:47:39,930
No,
I don't.

2476
01:47:40,050 --> 01:47:41,670
It's very big in Montreal.
Yeah.

2477
01:47:41,671 --> 01:47:46,671
No,
I don't think Chappelle on tennis Canada

2478
01:47:47,670 --> 01:47:52,670
stops in comedy.
That calm and jokes by candice on 

2479
01:47:52,670 --> 01:47:52,670
twitter and Instagram.
All right,

2480
01:47:52,670 --> 01:47:52,920
candice.
Thank you.

2481
01:47:53,040 --> 01:47:54,090
We did it.
Yay.

2482
01:47:55,260 --> 01:47:56,550
Thanks for again.
My pleasure.

2483
01:47:56,640 --> 01:47:56,850
Hmm.
