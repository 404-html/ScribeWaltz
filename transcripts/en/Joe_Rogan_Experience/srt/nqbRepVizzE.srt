1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,620
It's just started.
Did you start a registry?

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:05,070
How dare you man?
I'm not tweeting it.

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,410
Hold on.
So people have to hear me tweet.

4
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:10,560
Here we go.

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,200
Here we go.
Good on twitter.

6
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:15,400
Yep.

7
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:17,730
Tapenade numbers

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,400
talking.
Go for it,

9
00:00:20,401 --> 00:00:22,150
baby.
Saying come on and don't consider.

10
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:24,890
I don't know that song.
The twitter.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,480
Yeah,
I forgot my phone at home.

12
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,880
Which later?
You forgot your phone.

13
00:00:28,881 --> 00:00:32,480
I feel so fucking naked right now.
It's never just awful.

14
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,910
At least I just tracked it online so I'm
keeping an eye on it.

15
00:00:34,911 --> 00:00:37,640
So it's kind of like looking at photos 
of my family,

16
00:00:37,641 --> 00:00:38,450
you know?
It's like,

17
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:41,180
it feels good that I know it's still 
alive like,

18
00:00:41,181 --> 00:00:46,181
you know,
like I see it on Google maps and still 

19
00:00:46,181 --> 00:00:49,430
alive listed.
If I just tweeted what are the odds that

20
00:00:49,431 --> 00:00:54,431
Joe Rogan and Duncan trussell got so 
higher now having an amazing 

21
00:00:54,431 --> 00:00:54,431
conversation without the podcasts 
running.

22
00:00:54,431 --> 00:00:55,830
It's true.
I'm going to tweet one.

23
00:00:56,060 --> 00:01:01,060
Tweet that with 100 percent.
Let's just plow through this commercial 

24
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:05,081
real quick so we can get started.
The Joe Rogan experience podcast is 

25
00:01:05,081 --> 00:01:05,081
brought to you by.

26
00:01:05,081 --> 00:01:09,100
I said pod cat high cat's podcast is 
brought to you by [inaudible] dot net.

27
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:13,430
Click on the link for the flashlight and
enter in the code name Brogan.

28
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,610
You will get 15 percent off the number 
one sex toy for men.

29
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,370
Dunkin,
you'd go,

30
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:20,780
you're going to enjoy.
I got a new one for you.

31
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:21,860
Excellent.
What is it?

32
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,650
It's,
it's uh,

33
00:01:22,651 --> 00:01:23,900
uh,
give it to you later.

34
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,130
Really.
Some girls,

35
00:01:25,131 --> 00:01:27,230
but all or something.
Is it the Iron Lady?

36
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:32,550
Good.
Whoever it looks like a great little 

37
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:32,550
butthole.
You're going to love it.

38
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:33,320
Yeah.
How do you know it's a girl's butthole?

39
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:35,900
While they say they modeled them after 
the girls puzzling.

40
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,370
It looks like a butthole.
It's like they.

41
00:01:37,371 --> 00:01:38,690
Yeah,
they do the vagina.

42
00:01:38,691 --> 00:01:40,120
They do the butthole.
They,

43
00:01:40,121 --> 00:01:42,620
they actually make a mold.
They're posting.

44
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,430
That's why a lot of these freaks.
Like these porn star chicks.

45
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,210
Yeah.
They have their own flashlights.

46
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:52,630
It's like molded after their own box.
So there's a professional pussy mold or 

47
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:55,310
something looks on the outside like 
exactly what their box looks like.

48
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:59,990
That's the weirdest jobs on teen back in
Boston.

49
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:04,970
I want to get inside a box.
You got to touch a box.

50
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:08,720
That's what dudes used to say a lot.
The worst description.

51
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:14,030
China,
it's the least geometric shape on the 

52
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:17,231
planet is the last thing you want to 
fuck is a box is that Boston was a mess 

53
00:02:19,251 --> 00:02:20,990
anyway.
Did they do that when you were young?

54
00:02:20,991 --> 00:02:22,130
Was that box or.
No,

55
00:02:22,131 --> 00:02:25,100
but I can remember.
I can remember getting like sick.

56
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,250
My mom was a psychologist that she like 
gave me like a,

57
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:33,460
a sex book,
like when I was trying to learn about 

58
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,681
sex and it was like lists of the,
of the slang for pussy and I remember 

59
00:02:35,681 --> 00:02:40,061
getting the box and it was like wracking
my already vague understanding of what a

60
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:44,060
policy wise because it's like I always 
at anything like a box.

61
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:46,880
That's hilarious.
It's more like a bag than a box.

62
00:02:46,881 --> 00:02:49,970
It's not like youtube either,
but that's what the flashlight is.

63
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,860
It's a tube.
Well,

64
00:02:51,861 --> 00:02:52,460
it's a.
it's a,

65
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,210
it's a.
it's.

66
00:02:53,211 --> 00:02:55,760
I don't want to do a fucking puppet show
with flashlights.

67
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,570
That's taking a hand puppet show with 
your hands.

68
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:05,240
You can make mount.
I was thinking about taking the many 

69
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,370
flashlights you've given me and doing 
some kind of like Shakespeare,

70
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:11,380
but how many do you have?
Well now there's only two.

71
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,360
Now.
One of them is totally to now.

72
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,710
One of them is,
well no one of them.

73
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:22,880
This is a gross story.
I don't going to tell her what is a 

74
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,921
disgusting.
Sorry I didn't clean one out and I left 

75
00:03:25,921 --> 00:03:29,461
it sitting on top of the shower is a 
growth story and I like so,

76
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:31,510
so I,
uh,

77
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:36,550
I can remember the smell.
It's the smell is what I imagine these 

78
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:42,050
hives and starcraft smell like.
It's like this just disintegrated alien.

79
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,050
It's like the smell of it.
Like you know,

80
00:03:44,051 --> 00:03:49,051
when the aliens,
when they go down into that fucking in 

81
00:03:49,051 --> 00:03:51,991
the very beginning,
when they go into the pit where there's 

82
00:03:51,991 --> 00:03:52,030
all the pods and the thing pops out and 
lands in the guy's face.

83
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:53,580
It's in the very beginning of the movie 
alien.

84
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:58,590
It's like a have seen it.
That's what an old flashlight smells 

85
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:59,620
like when you open it.
It's this kind of alien,

86
00:03:59,621 --> 00:04:00,970
pungent,
muscular,

87
00:04:00,971 --> 00:04:05,971
primordial smell.
But I opened it up and men who was just 

88
00:04:06,701 --> 00:04:11,701
like black and dark is black ooze,
just kind of drips out of it.

89
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:12,670
And,
and,

90
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,050
and so I threw that one away.

91
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:18,420
Is it like,
seriously dissonant?

92
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,170
You'd have to disinfect that with so 
many chemicals.

93
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,720
Have to worry about those chemicals 
eventually burning the skin off your 

94
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:26,720
deck.
Well,

95
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:26,720
yeah.
And,

96
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,800
and some unknown disease.
Leprosy.

97
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:35,080
That's where it gets born in the bottom 
of the fleshlight from some sick fucks.

98
00:04:35,081 --> 00:04:37,940
It never bothered to clean it.
You tried to fuck it twice.

99
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:43,030
That's the end of the world.
The,

100
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:48,070
the one,
the one flashlight and there'll be told 

101
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:48,860
about on fucking big stone tablets 
10,000

102
00:04:48,861 --> 00:04:51,850
years from now,
we've traced it back to a flashlight and

103
00:04:51,851 --> 00:04:56,851
there's only a few people survived.
Only liked from one particular area of 

104
00:04:57,170 --> 00:05:00,410
Ethiopia were able to handle it well.
What dead?

105
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:05,530
I mean a flashlight is truly a breeding 
ground for bacteria if you consider it,

106
00:05:05,531 --> 00:05:09,330
especially if you keep it in the balmy 
atmosphere of your shower because you're

107
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:14,340
combining fucking.
You're combining so many bad elements 

108
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,850
thing and he makes him with heat.

109
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,050
Sure.
And who knows what's in the water,

110
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:23,060
water supply DNA,
your true life precursors in there.

111
00:05:23,461 --> 00:05:25,220
You could.
It could sprout a new life.

112
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,810
Jesus fucking Christ.
Why not?

113
00:05:27,811 --> 00:05:28,680
Right?
Yeah,

114
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:29,240
mean we,
we,

115
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:34,290
we poo poo that.
But could you imagine if it was that 

116
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:36,121
easy?
Can you imagine if your loads on their 

117
00:05:36,121 --> 00:05:36,400
own could make people just grow like 
mushrooms or imagine.

118
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:39,460
I mean when we know that you have to 
interact with a woman and make eggs,

119
00:05:39,461 --> 00:05:42,640
you know,
crack eggs and make babies that way.

120
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:47,760
But imagine if that wasn't the case,
imagine if every time you came it made 

121
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,840
people measure,
people came out of your Dick and there's

122
00:05:48,841 --> 00:05:53,841
just people everywhere,
everywhere getting stepped on that 

123
00:05:53,841 --> 00:05:53,841
little ones,
never get to be adults.

124
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:58,240
We take it for granted that the process 
is a and female

125
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:00,170
and that that's the only way to create 
life.

126
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:05,740
I mean,
life is crazy enough as it is to think 

127
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,711
they would,
could have been in some bizarre Gonzo 

128
00:06:08,711 --> 00:06:12,581
parallel universe that it's possible to 
just create life with your Dick and 

129
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:12,920
every time you come,
boom,

130
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:17,950
people,
a person can be a very overpopulated 

131
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:21,611
university.
Imagine people screaming at you because 

132
00:06:21,611 --> 00:06:23,220
you're beating off you fuckhead.
What are y'all doing?

133
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,720
Piling on top of people everywhere and 
then you kept someone beating off.

134
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:29,780
Will you fucking stop it?
They just make it.

135
00:06:29,781 --> 00:06:31,850
People bought.
That's what people would do.

136
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:33,890
We wouldn't make so many people.
If that was the case,

137
00:06:33,891 --> 00:06:37,160
there'd be so many people that the world
would cave in.

138
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,260
There would be no more written work.
You would have.

139
00:06:39,261 --> 00:06:40,940
People would just eat the people in 
front of them.

140
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,960
You run out of reach.
So yeah,

141
00:06:41,961 --> 00:06:46,961
we'd be just eating each other,
meeting the people in front of him 

142
00:06:46,961 --> 00:06:46,961
jerking off and making more.

143
00:06:46,961 --> 00:06:49,300
I mean,
at what point can overpopulation exist?

144
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,080
I mean,
if there's no structure,

145
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:56,110
right?
If you took all the people in New York 

146
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:56,110
City with no structures,
no buildings,

147
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:57,930
just piled them on top of each other.
You know how many.

148
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,280
How much room is there?
How much room is there?

149
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,700
At what point in time could you a 
fucking imagine?

150
00:07:04,701 --> 00:07:09,701
How many people would it take to cover 
the planet and just a complete map of 

151
00:07:10,941 --> 00:07:13,640
people.
It's just every time someone came,

152
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:17,060
a person was born.
How long was it?

153
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,220
Just looked like an octopus.
Oh my God.

154
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:22,760
Warming freaks.
No one would stop.

155
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:25,700
We wouldn't stop.
We would nonstop jerking off.

156
00:07:25,701 --> 00:07:30,701
We would.
We'd have entire continents covered and 

157
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:31,370
you'd come up with a good reason why 
you're jerking off.

158
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,670
You'd rationalize like,
wow,

159
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,860
what the fuck?
I go,

160
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:37,510
dude,
a new.

161
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:41,570
The government would get involved though
and make you so you can't come.

162
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,070
Like they would start neutering.
You would be the government.

163
00:07:44,071 --> 00:07:46,550
They'd be swarms of people.
It'd be unmanageable.

164
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,780
There'd be no government.
No,

165
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,270
no buildings.
The blog,

166
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:51,590
we would have never even built 
buildings.

167
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:54,560
If it was possible,
we would have ever figured out anything.

168
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,990
If that was how you could come and make 
a person.

169
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:59,530
It'd be like grass.
It'd be like grass at.

170
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,650
Yeah.
We'd be everywhere.

171
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,120
Kudzu.
Yeah.

172
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,200
Ridiculous.
Anyway,

173
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,840
go to [inaudible] dot net.
Click on the link for the flashlight,

174
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,360
the codename Rogan,
and you get 15 percent off the ruin sex 

175
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,310
toy for men,
but best commercial ever.

176
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,830
Those are the best one we ever did.
People complain about those.

177
00:08:15,831 --> 00:08:16,460
I'm like,
come on,

178
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:20,420
we're free balling.
We're just having fun.

179
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:22,340
Let us just do this little business 
thing.

180
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:24,200
We're also brought to you by.
Wait,

181
00:08:24,201 --> 00:08:24,470
wait,
wait,

182
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:26,300
and if you don't want to buy a 
flashlight,

183
00:08:26,301 --> 00:08:26,840
don't buy it.

184
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:29,060
Just make your own eye.
How can you do that?

185
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,560
Easily?
Melons,

186
00:08:30,561 --> 00:08:31,880
melons,
fruits,

187
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:34,360
but did not going to be as good as the 
flush if you're looking to master,

188
00:08:34,361 --> 00:08:39,361
but it's a fucking solid tool.
There's probably some shit you can do 

189
00:08:39,361 --> 00:08:39,361
with Jello and gumby and will be as good
as the flashlight.

190
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:40,640
They got it.
They got it down.

191
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:43,490
Whatever that polymer is,
they used to make the vagina.

192
00:08:43,491 --> 00:08:45,620
It's fucking outstanding.
They spent a long time.

193
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:46,990
Jumps up.
Yeah,

194
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,160
they did.
They have a great product.

195
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,670
There's how many people are embarrassed 
about the fact that like to masturbate.

196
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,930
How many uncomfortable flashlights that 
guy fuck before he

197
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:58,800
came upon this.
Could you imagine that?

198
00:08:58,801 --> 00:09:01,500
Poor Weirdo.
This one's made out of rock,

199
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:07,170
eh?
He didn't touch them with fingers first.

200
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,650
You don't want to just shove your Dick 
Right into this new retro model.

201
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:17,500
You don't let it do that if you don't 
want to just use the,

202
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,980
they must have tested them out to 
animals.

203
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:25,270
They use the animal or solving.
Ultimately the dude had to fuck like a 

204
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:29,790
lot of different

205
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,080
substances in order to create that 
perfect vagina.

206
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:34,550
I mean,
how do you describe that?

207
00:09:34,551 --> 00:09:35,790
If you're trying to make it,
you know,

208
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,090
and you bring it to a factory.
This is what I'm looking for.

209
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,590
Something like,
fuck,

210
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,440
I'd like to see that moment when he 
found it.

211
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:44,210
He said,
yeah,

212
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,950
I came like five times that last line.

213
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,120
Uh,
well,

214
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,740
yeah,
what a weird,

215
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,790
a weird thing to invent.
But he did an awesome job.

216
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:58,820
However,
the process was we're making light of 

217
00:09:58,820 --> 00:09:58,820
it.

218
00:09:58,820 --> 00:09:59,210
He needs to write about the pilot came 
about.

219
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:01,580
That's an interesting thing now.
No.

220
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,590
Well I think uh,

221
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:04,020
do to invented it.
His,

222
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:05,550
um,
his uh,

223
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,300
his wife was pregnant when he invented 
it and he couldn't have sex.

224
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:13,050
So they figured out.
He gives resourceful fella.

225
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,000
See that?
Yeah.

226
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,250
That's what you need,
man.

227
00:10:15,251 --> 00:10:18,120
If you want to invent something good,
you've got to be pushed.

228
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,050
You got to be pushed,
pushed in a corner.

229
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:25,080
Yeah,
and then you go for the box stuck.

230
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:31,420
You're writing a box.
Worse description.

231
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:37,370
Description started with a guy.
His wife had a deformed pussy was 

232
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,170
brought to you by [inaudible] Dot Com,

233
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:42,280
o n n I t bakers of Alpha brain,
the cognitive enhancing supplement.

234
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:45,820
A shroom tech immune.
So you use the shroom tech immune

235
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,340
like I'm a fucking shell because I'm 
agreeing to everything here,

236
00:10:50,341 --> 00:10:53,180
but I've used these things.
These shroom tech.

237
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,020
Yeah.
When I'm starting to get sick,

238
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:56,590
I eat it and I get better at this stuff.
Real.

239
00:10:56,591 --> 00:10:57,990
I'm sorry.
This stuff really works.

240
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,070
It sure is great for just to keep your 
immune system strong.

241
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:06,100
Apparently the way it works is there's 
something in it that makes your body 

242
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:06,940
think that it's like a disease,
like,

243
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:08,670
yeah,
whatever.

244
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:13,880
If there's an intruder,
so your immune system fires up for a 

245
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:17,441
fight that never takes place.
It's pretty fucking sporty thing if it 

246
00:11:17,441 --> 00:11:17,441
works like that.
Um,

247
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,760
there's also an Alpha brain,
excuse me,

248
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:23,510
shroom tech sport,
which is the quadriceps mushroom,

249
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:28,590
a sports endurance supplement.
And this is only for people who are 

250
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:30,020
really into working out.
If you're not in Oregon out,

251
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:31,930
don't fuck with it.
Brian doesn't.

252
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,440
Nah,
I don't need it.

253
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:37,540
But if you're in Fitbit,
my fitbit let's say,

254
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:42,800
is that like last three days?
It is for people that don't know what 

255
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,401
you're talking about.
It's his little thing you snap on you 

256
00:11:45,401 --> 00:11:45,401
and it counts your steps.
And it also like,

257
00:11:45,401 --> 00:11:49,331
I like every time you do go up and 
downstairs it measures out what that 

258
00:11:49,331 --> 00:11:52,511
would be in distance.
It just pretty much tracks everything 

259
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:55,540
you do physically and then at night you 
it and it tells you how long you sleep,

260
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:58,320
how many times do you wake up in the 
middle of the night and in it.

261
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:03,570
Then it graphs it on this nice page on 
their website and then you start having 

262
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:03,820
like a facebook page of what your fitbit
is.

263
00:12:03,821 --> 00:12:04,600
It's really weird.
It's like,

264
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:07,680
it's like twitter weird.
Like we have these stats and then like,

265
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:10,000
like right now my only friends,
Bert Kreischer and,

266
00:12:10,001 --> 00:12:11,420
and you know,
I look at his and he's like,

267
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,610
like kicks ass.

268
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,650
And then my shit's like,
you know,

269
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:19,920
barely registering on the graph and my 
battery light's like seven times longer 

270
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,980
than birch.
That's like a new way to stalk people.

271
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:25,480
I mean,
you could be their exercise buddy.

272
00:12:25,481 --> 00:12:26,750
Yeah.
Get a,

273
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,220
a constant readout.
I bet the readouts.

274
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:31,540
Being sensitive government also.
That's going to be the thing,

275
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:36,541
man.
You're going to have to put your 

276
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:37,501
information out there so people know 
where your heart rate is at every 

277
00:12:37,501 --> 00:12:38,940
moment.
I have this thing that tweets here.

278
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:43,950
Wait,
they have a scale that tweets your way 

279
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:45,640
so that it's not supposed to keep you 
motivated to lose weight.

280
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,680
Well eventually it's going to be more 
than that.

281
00:12:47,681 --> 00:12:52,681
If you have something on tweets it every
time you get on it so you can't even 

282
00:12:52,681 --> 00:12:52,750
stop it.
So yeah,

283
00:12:52,751 --> 00:12:57,040
that's it.
So you get onto this really brutal on.

284
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:58,640
You're gaining weight and you start.

285
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:01,780
It was brutal.
But we are saying about the invention of

286
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,000
the flashlight.
If you weren't real change to happen,

287
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:09,150
change comes from fucking suffering.
Change comes from being in a place that 

288
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:09,550
you don't want to be.
I mean,

289
00:13:09,551 --> 00:13:14,551
you could do it other ways,
but generally it comes from getting 

290
00:13:14,551 --> 00:13:14,551
backed into a corner.
Yeah,

291
00:13:14,551 --> 00:13:16,750
you gotta you gotta straighten up.
You get your shit together.

292
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:20,560
You got to fight back.
That's why people get enthusiastic about

293
00:13:20,561 --> 00:13:25,450
things and start companies and get a big
burst of enthusiasm.

294
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,670
I could never murder somebody while 
wearing a fitbit.

295
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:29,950
I just realized why because they will 
know.

296
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:34,980
They will be able to see graph because 
it shows you when you're extremely 

297
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:39,030
working out and it has like red grabs 
and stuffed up thinking about murdering 

298
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,420
people.
Or I could put it on somebody that,

299
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:41,560
that,
you know,

300
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:45,310
isn't like sleeping like I could put on 
my mom and then go out and in the middle

301
00:13:45,311 --> 00:13:46,990
of the night and murder people that come
back and take off.

302
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:51,990
My Mom's not going to accept your fit 
bit and that they could use that as 

303
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:52,180
evidence.
I would imagine.

304
00:13:52,181 --> 00:13:53,860
Well,
there could also use it as evidence that

305
00:13:53,861 --> 00:13:57,580
your resting heart rate went from 70 to 
82 or whatever.

306
00:13:57,581 --> 00:14:02,581
Open person.
So I did a review on [inaudible] dot TV 

307
00:14:02,581 --> 00:14:03,910
fitbit.
You're really into it.

308
00:14:03,911 --> 00:14:04,460
Uh,
uh,

309
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:09,500
and it's kind of,
I can see what it's like when I started 

310
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:09,500
using twitter for the first time.
There's something there.

311
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:12,040
There's some kind of weird.
This is the next step,

312
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:13,870
right?
This is the next piece of connectivity.

313
00:14:13,871 --> 00:14:17,380
This is turning your body into an x box 
when it comes to like fitness,

314
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:18,890
you know,
it's fit.

315
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,170
That's fucking bad ass man.

316
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:23,980
Wow.
That's kind of interesting.

317
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:29,460
Yeah.
And of course you're going to be like 

318
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:32,150
that.
Have the most friends of fitbit rural 

319
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:34,171
because you're going to be working out 
so extreme and everyone that would be 

320
00:14:34,171 --> 00:14:34,171
like,
you're,

321
00:14:34,171 --> 00:14:36,910
you're not like instead of Dane Cook 
having 5 million friends on twitter that

322
00:14:36,911 --> 00:14:40,570
you would have the most extreme.
You have the most like red graph,

323
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,530
like you worked out the hardest or a lot
of dudes beating off to my account.

324
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:48,550
Could be that too.
And the person that sleeps,

325
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:53,570
that's the person that sleeps the best.
Would it be like some kind of weird 

326
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:53,570
wizard of

327
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:57,040
Fitbit road?
We should have talked about this on the 

328
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,220
let's just get this commercial over with
on a day you just go to [inaudible] dot 

329
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:00,470
com.
I'm tired of talking about this stuff.

330
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:03,290
Here's how I feel about it.
It's we can't make this any nicer.

331
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:08,291
And by the way,
we had to change a rule because some 

332
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:08,450
people are cons.
We used to say that if you buy something

333
00:15:08,451 --> 00:15:13,451
and you don't like it,
you could send it back and you don't 

334
00:15:13,451 --> 00:15:16,511
even have to send it back.
We'll give you 100 percent money back 

335
00:15:16,511 --> 00:15:19,570
guarantee.
But people were buying like 10 bottles 

336
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:23,230
and then they would.
They would take like three of them will 

337
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:23,230
go,
yeah,

338
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:26,861
I'm not really into this.
And so then they would sell the rest on 

339
00:15:26,861 --> 00:15:28,220
Ebay so they would get their refund and 
then they would sell on Ebay.

340
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:32,800
Unbelievable people such twats it will 
find a hole that was a good idea,

341
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,660
but it wasn't a good idea to take 
advantage of our hospitality.

342
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:40,690
So now it's only the first 30 pills and 
you should be able to figure out within 

343
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:40,690
30 pills.
I mean,

344
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,430
you know,
it's a lot of people say like,

345
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,270
if you could you,
can you really.

346
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:47,540
How much can you tell the difference 
between when you're eating multivitamins

347
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:49,040
and when you're not?
Any multivitamins?

348
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:52,100
I can tell.
I can tell there's this subtle thing.

349
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:54,680
It's a,
but I'm really in tune with my shit.

350
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:57,230
I eat healthy.
I work out a lot.

351
00:15:57,231 --> 00:16:02,231
I take supplements.
I know like what gets me and what 

352
00:16:02,231 --> 00:16:02,231
doesn't.
But there's some people,

353
00:16:02,231 --> 00:16:03,860
man that don't know you can,
you can give them things and they're not

354
00:16:03,861 --> 00:16:05,320
sure.
Is this my multivitamin?

355
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:07,700
Wharton was in watching,
you know,

356
00:16:07,701 --> 00:16:08,600
they're not,
they don't feel they're,

357
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:10,670
but they're not in tune with their body 
so much.

358
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
You know,
and I mean if you're not really 

359
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,100
athletic,
if you don't push your body to extremes 

360
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:18,440
and you don't eat healthy and clean,
I think a lot of people,

361
00:16:18,441 --> 00:16:23,441
they.
There's a missing amount of 

362
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:25,211
communication.
There's not an in intimacy with your 

363
00:16:25,211 --> 00:16:25,211
body.

364
00:16:25,211 --> 00:16:25,211
Well,
they,

365
00:16:25,211 --> 00:16:25,780
what?
I think when you're feeling bad,

366
00:16:25,781 --> 00:16:28,660
you kind of get good at numbing it out 
or ignoring it.

367
00:16:28,661 --> 00:16:29,940
So they're,
they've kind of liked.

368
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:35,070
They've shut down their ability to like 
feel if you really honestly appraise 

369
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:39,691
their health because like if you're out 
of shape and you're fucking smoking all 

370
00:16:39,691 --> 00:16:40,150
the time and you're drinking all the 
time,

371
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:45,360
I speak from experience.
If you get into like a Jag of living 

372
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:45,550
like that,
after a certain amount of time,

373
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,510
you just start tuning out the weird 
pains in your body.

374
00:16:49,511 --> 00:16:51,310
You just started ignoring it because you
don't want to.

375
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:56,670
You don't because it's just the truth 
and the truth is you can't constantly 

376
00:16:56,670 --> 00:17:00,211
fucking eat like shit and smoke and 
drink and that ended up with you at the 

377
00:17:00,251 --> 00:17:01,630
other end of that feeling great.

378
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:08,170
So important to take a variety of 
different things that are good for your 

379
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:09,440
health.
In my opinion,

380
00:17:09,441 --> 00:17:12,290
you should really eat a lot of healthy 
vegetables.

381
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:13,880
That's like one of the most important 
things.

382
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:19,210
One of the strongest things I've ever 
done is increase the amount of like 

383
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:21,750
green leafy vegetables in my diet and 
drink kale shakes and shit like that.

384
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:25,880
Take multivitamins please.
It's not hard.

385
00:17:25,881 --> 00:17:29,030
It's fucking easy and it'll make you 
healthier.

386
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:31,310
It just,
it will make you feel better.

387
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:33,590
Eat good food,
you know,

388
00:17:33,591 --> 00:17:37,850
and and look into nootropics if you're 
not into any of the shit that we have at

389
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,550
[inaudible] dot com.
There's plenty of other people that have

390
00:17:40,551 --> 00:17:45,551
cool shit available,
so we try to make it as easy and as 

391
00:17:45,551 --> 00:17:49,120
clean as possible.
I'm way more concerned than I say this 

392
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:49,740
every fucking time,
but it's because it's true.

393
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:55,080
I'm way more concerned with not ripping 
people off than I am with making money.

394
00:17:55,470 --> 00:18:00,470
So that's the end of that fucking 
horseshit button.

395
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,780
Let's start the show.
Duncan trussell.

396
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:22,810
I cut way back on my coffee consumption.
I have found that coffee and the show go

397
00:18:23,751 --> 00:18:24,840
well together.
Oh yeah.

398
00:18:24,841 --> 00:18:29,630
I think they're important in order to 
just keep spitting information out.

399
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,580
This is this.
What are you doing with that Echo,

400
00:18:31,581 --> 00:18:32,300
man?
You're killing me.

401
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,650
Won't go waiting for it.
It won't go away.

402
00:18:34,651 --> 00:18:38,010
Period.
To be crazy,

403
00:18:38,011 --> 00:18:43,011
man.
That's how it feels like when you're 

404
00:18:43,011 --> 00:18:44,390
tripping,
like you smoke too much weed and you 

405
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:44,390
start having a panic attack that started
going on.

406
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:46,500
It's almost there.
It's almost kind of his own.

407
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:47,890
Such a delay.
It's,

408
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,860
it's just a weird,
stupid,

409
00:18:49,861 --> 00:18:53,460
special effect that I do.
Do you always do the same one?

410
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:54,030
No,
it doesn't.

411
00:18:54,031 --> 00:18:55,560
Usually.
I usually mix it up.

412
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,480
Does this make you feel better when you 
do these things?

413
00:18:57,481 --> 00:18:58,530
Yeah,
it's just a cool intro.

414
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:01,650
You know?
Might as well start off with a weird,

415
00:19:01,651 --> 00:19:04,260
creepy noise.
Doug and trust is here.

416
00:19:04,261 --> 00:19:06,360
How we can.
We don't have to get any weird or creepy

417
00:19:06,361 --> 00:19:11,361
or not creepy in a bad way,
brother.

418
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,640
Creeping the best possible way.
You know,

419
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,360
I love you.
We all love you.

420
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:20,520
I love you guys were doing the Chicago 
Theater,

421
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:21,900
uh,
this Friday night.

422
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:27,380
Fucking super fired up in me and Joey 
Coco motherfucking Diaz in the flesh if 

423
00:19:29,131 --> 00:19:34,131
you,
if you have never had a chance to see 

424
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:35,490
Joey Diaz live going to shit yourself.
That guy,

425
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,350
dude,
he had his moments.

426
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:41,250
He had some moments on stage where it's 
just ridiculous shit that he says.

427
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:45,090
It just makes you repeat what he said 
over and over and over again.

428
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:50,190
He's one of those dudes when he,
when Joey like really rocks it on stage,

429
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:55,310
he'll say one of the something so 
fucking completely preposterous and so 

430
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:58,200
out of control that you'll just be 
repeating it.

431
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,690
You'd be like,
he's fucking.

432
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:02,960
You'll just repeat what he said.
Like over and over.

433
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
He had the reregistration your head 
almost like did I really just had his 

434
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,730
fucking that transvestite joke.

435
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,430
One of the greatest jokes anybody's ever
told onstage.

436
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,390
He goes,
I like transvestites.

437
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:16,830
They Cook,
they clean.

438
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,000
They couldn't beat on him.
Every once in awhile the cops come who 

439
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,000
they're gonna,
believe me or some dude with a wig and a

440
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,331
black guy.
There's no support groups for these 

441
00:20:26,331 --> 00:20:27,300
people.
The cops come,

442
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:29,640
who is it going to believe me?
Dude,

443
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:33,800
a wig and a black.
That's just,

444
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,120
that's just poetry,
man.

445
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,710
To me,
that's poetry.

446
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:38,370
You know,
like the,

447
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:42,570
the amount of words used,
the structure of it,

448
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,520
the great jazz.
A fucking animal.

449
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:48,160
Chili ideas is an animal.
It's so

450
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,120
funny,
man.

451
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:51,030
We had them on the podcast the other 
day.

452
00:20:51,031 --> 00:20:51,670
Dude,
just talk.

453
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,970
He can talk about anything.
Toothpicks.

454
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:59,100
I know a fucking.
Due to my two picks on a fucking crazy 

455
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:03,190
story about a big factor in this chick 
was sucking everybody's Dick.

456
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:06,630
You know what I'm saying?
So Papa had to get his exist.

457
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:11,560
Toothpick factory story will become some
fucking epic.

458
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:14,770
He's fucking.
That's ever lived.

459
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:16,800
He's the greatest team of.
Bring this up.

460
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:22,320
I fucking love that guy.
That's one of the most awesome things 

461
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,550
about living here.
Is that all you guys are here.

462
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:29,980
That's one of the things that kind of 
keeps me in this area right now because 

463
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:31,630
all you guys are here,
it's like we have a lot of cool friends.

464
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:36,930
We have a very unusual situation.
We need to all move at the same exact 

465
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:42,720
thing.
We need to get together like an occupy 

466
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:42,720
Wall Street thing and be like,
all right,

467
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,000
we're all moving.
At the same time.

468
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:48,020
We got to be prepared for civil unrest 
because the government is okay.

469
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:51,430
So we've got to start thinking if the 
shit went down,

470
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,970
we need a goddamn ranch somewhere.
Yep.

471
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:59,130
You know,
a ranch somewhere with like a bunch of 

472
00:21:59,130 --> 00:21:59,130
houses,
a castle,

473
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:02,460
and Joe all live in this nice little 
farming ranch community until the dust 

474
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:02,880
settles.
Yeah,

475
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,030
you can do that,
man.

476
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:07,250
It's good to have a place like that to 
go to.

477
00:22:07,251 --> 00:22:08,930
Man.
I've got to a place like that to go to,

478
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,430
but yeah,
I do.

479
00:22:10,431 --> 00:22:12,980
But I did it in North Carolina.
It's in Jacksonville,

480
00:22:12,981 --> 00:22:14,060
North Carolina.
It's in Georgia.

481
00:22:14,061 --> 00:22:17,720
I will not reveal the precise location 
near the Georgia guidestones.

482
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,460
Oh,
I wish it was.

483
00:22:19,461 --> 00:22:21,470
Now it's not,
it's not near the Georgia guidestones.

484
00:22:21,471 --> 00:22:23,910
I don't know where those are actually,
but I'm sure those are either.

485
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:27,530
Let's find out how you going to do that,
but go ahead.

486
00:22:27,531 --> 00:22:29,060
Brought Dr.
but you got it.

487
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,070
I think it's a smart thing to have.
I mean,

488
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:36,370
in any fucking house you want to have,
you want to way if you're in a hotel or 

489
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:36,790
wherever,
it's good to know where to go if there's

490
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,860
going to be a fire.
It's the same thing with civilization.

491
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:40,960
It's not.
I mean,

492
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:45,970
it doesn't make you crazy.
It just makes you a normal thinking 

493
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:45,970
person.

494
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:47,660
Elbert County,
uh,

495
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:50,240
Elbert county's where in Galveston 
County,

496
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:56,200
the Georgia guidestones,
it'll large granite monument in Elbert 

497
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:56,420
County,
Georgia.

498
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:02,640
Yeah.
A message that contains 10 guides is 

499
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,000
inscribed on the structure in eight 
modern languages.

500
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:09,530
And a shorter message is inscribed at 
the top of the structure in,

501
00:23:09,531 --> 00:23:12,980
for ancient language scripts.
Babylonian,

502
00:23:12,981 --> 00:23:17,000
classical Greek sand script in Egypt,
in hieroglyphs.

503
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:18,710
You should have some pretty intense 
shit,

504
00:23:18,711 --> 00:23:19,210
man.
Yeah,

505
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:21,110
I mean this is someone saying,
you know,

506
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:25,010
look,
if humanity completely falls apart,

507
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,110
here's a message,
get to this stuff.

508
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,640
This is crucial information.

509
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:33,680
Somebody should have told them that 
there's not a lot of people in southern 

510
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:33,680
Georgia that speak classical

511
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:33,790
Greek.
This is what it says on.

512
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,490
It's really very interesting because 
it's very wise words.

513
00:23:36,491 --> 00:23:39,750
Listen to this.
Maintain humanity under $500,

514
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:42,790
million in perpetual balance with 
nature,

515
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,230
500 million on the whole planet.
Good idea.

516
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:50,180
Guide reproduction wisely.
Improving fitness and diversity.

517
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:52,520
Eugenics.
That sounds a little eugenics,

518
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:56,150
but rational as well,
right?

519
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:57,510
I mean,
you know,

520
00:23:57,511 --> 00:23:59,950
utopian,
of course Utopian but rash,

521
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:00,950
right?
Okay.

522
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,910
Unite humanity with a living new 
language.

523
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,350
We all had one language that would make 
everything a lot fucking easier.

524
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:10,970
Right?
Rule,

525
00:24:10,971 --> 00:24:12,290
passion,
faith,

526
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:15,590
tradition,
and all things with tempered reason.

527
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:18,290
Sound words,
write some words.

528
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:22,960
Protect people and nations with fair 
laws and just courts.

529
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:28,020
Okay.
Let all nations rule internally 

530
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,900
resolving external disputes in a world 
court.

531
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,670
I don't hear any new world order shit 
yet.

532
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:36,710
Right?
Avoid petty laws and useless officials a

533
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:38,180
bit.
Subjective.

534
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,830
Well,
I mean a lot of this stuff is subject.

535
00:24:40,831 --> 00:24:42,170
This is pretty subjective though,
right?

536
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:46,670
Hey laws and useless officials saying,
resolve your problems in a world court.

537
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:48,270
What?
How do you do that?

538
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:51,620
That seems like a weird one.
The petty laws and useless officials.

539
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:54,350
It seems silly.
That seems like it should be.

540
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:55,160
You know,
maybe.

541
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,350
Well,
price is a good one.

542
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:00,290
Bounce personal rights with social 
duties.

543
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,760
Agreed.
That's smart,

544
00:25:01,761 --> 00:25:03,020
right?
Strong communities.

545
00:25:03,021 --> 00:25:03,480
Shit.
Yeah.

546
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,450
Prize truth.
Beauty.

547
00:25:05,451 --> 00:25:09,740
Love seeking harmony with the infinite.
Okay.

548
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:11,990
Now you're getting a little crystally.
Okay.

549
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,340
It sounds almost like Dr.
Bronner's soap.

550
00:25:14,341 --> 00:25:16,290
It's like that shit on Dr.
Bronner's soap.

551
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,390
Okay,
here we hear here.

552
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:18,740
Now I don't like it at all.
Listen,

553
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:22,550
be not a cancer on the earth,
leave room for nature,

554
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:27,760
leave room for nature.
Now I don't like it because that's a 

555
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:27,950
stupid thing to say.
First of all,

556
00:25:27,951 --> 00:25:30,550
be not a cancer on the earth.
What do you Shakespeare Bitch,

557
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:31,630
you,
they don't have cancer.

558
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,360
Don't be cancer.
Cancer,

559
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:40,570
silly.
I guess if you're not going to use 

560
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:42,431
contractions,
maybe you think contractions with real 

561
00:25:42,431 --> 00:25:42,431
people.

562
00:25:42,431 --> 00:25:45,290
I think.
Here's the thing that I think is really 

563
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:46,890
funny about these stones and about like,
I just watched cave of forgotten dreams,

564
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:48,570
which is pretty awesome.
Um,

565
00:25:48,571 --> 00:25:50,250
which is like they went,
didn't get into it,

566
00:25:50,251 --> 00:25:50,600
man.
I,

567
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:55,760
I shut it off halfway and I got bored.
I thought I got into it because I was 

568
00:25:56,190 --> 00:26:01,190
just thinking about how crazy it was.
The rhinos were in France at one point 

569
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:01,680
and kind of like who the fuck are these 
people?

570
00:26:01,681 --> 00:26:06,681
It was a little dry,
but if you carve something in stone and 

571
00:26:07,921 --> 00:26:10,980
you put it deep enough in this stone and
are big enough stone,

572
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:16,520
it's guaranteed that if people are still
around in like hundreds of thousands of 

573
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:20,001
years,
they're going to think that that really 

574
00:26:20,001 --> 00:26:20,001
meant something,
you know,

575
00:26:20,001 --> 00:26:23,811
they're going to think it was very 
important just because you carved it in 

576
00:26:23,811 --> 00:26:24,030
stone,
so it could be anything.

577
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:29,180
You could put anything on a cave wall 
and people will come in and look at and 

578
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:29,180
be like,
wow,

579
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:34,250
look at this.
They're either they worshiped a penis 

580
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:38,300
with a with a happy face on it and it's 
just a guy like painted something on 

581
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:43,310
Georgia guidestones.
It's just some guy went and carved some 

582
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:43,310
shit and stone makes

583
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,010
sense.
I mean I just be not a cancer on

584
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:45,450
the earth.
Leave Room for nature.

585
00:26:45,451 --> 00:26:47,300
Leave Room for nature.
That means that is.

586
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,230
I mean I'm,
we're goofing on it,

587
00:26:49,231 --> 00:26:51,150
but that is like a good thought.

588
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:53,550
I think they're great for all of it.
Seems like.

589
00:26:53,551 --> 00:26:54,450
Okay.
It's just.

590
00:26:54,451 --> 00:26:55,720
I don't think that there's anything.

591
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:56,830
Well,
it's like twitter messages.

592
00:26:56,831 --> 00:26:59,500
You can't get too profound when you're 
carving in stone.

593
00:26:59,501 --> 00:27:00,730
Yeah.
You're carving on a fucking,

594
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:02,410
a limited amount of space.
Uh,

595
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,320
yeah.
What,

596
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:08,410
what would you tell people if you,
if you had Georgia guidestones of your 

597
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:11,611
own,
if you could leave behind some monument 

598
00:27:11,611 --> 00:27:12,490
to future monkey people that figure this
out again?

599
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,280
Yeah.
You know what?

600
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:15,370
So many,
so many quoted.

601
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,970
It was a fascinating quote.
That civilization,

602
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:24,540
if you,
if you look at it as made by the 

603
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:24,540
brightest minds,
is disappointing.

604
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:29,790
It's disappointing where we are,
but if you look at it as something 

605
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:31,060
that's been thrown together by monkeys,
it's amazing.

606
00:27:31,061 --> 00:27:31,600
Amazing.

607
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:35,730
We're doing so good right now.
If you think about how good we're doing,

608
00:27:35,731 --> 00:27:36,720
we're doing great,

609
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:39,240
but isn't that an interesting thing that
you know,

610
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:44,241
that people know that human beings are 
capable of so much better,

611
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:49,290
so much better behavior,
so much more of a,

612
00:27:49,291 --> 00:27:51,490
of a safe,
sane,

613
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:53,410
rational,
loving world.

614
00:27:53,411 --> 00:27:55,840
We're capable that we're all capable of 
that as an,

615
00:27:55,841 --> 00:28:00,841
as individuals will cave.
We're all capable of being loving and 

616
00:28:00,841 --> 00:28:02,740
nice and friendly,
and if we're all capable of it.

617
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:08,070
Then in groups we spread out and then 
somehow or another it gets lost along 

618
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:12,001
the way.
So where does it get lost on the way 

619
00:28:12,001 --> 00:28:12,001
when they're fighting over resources,
when they're fighting over,

620
00:28:12,001 --> 00:28:12,920
you know,
crazy ideas.

621
00:28:12,921 --> 00:28:13,030
Yeah.

622
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:16,170
The ideas.
Mostly it's the problem is the ideas.

623
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:20,860
It's the resources thing.
If you have resources you can work out.

624
00:28:20,861 --> 00:28:23,590
If you don't have crazy ideas,
research resources,

625
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,290
you can work out.
It's the fucking crazy ideas.

626
00:28:26,291 --> 00:28:28,240
I just saw that guy,
the physicist.

627
00:28:28,241 --> 00:28:29,620
Well,
I can never pronounce his name.

628
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:30,760
Moceanu.
What's this?

629
00:28:30,761 --> 00:28:32,740
He's a genius in Chicago.
Yes.

630
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:33,460
He,
uh,

631
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:38,580
he was talking about the different types
of civilization type zero civilization 

632
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,390
type one civilization type two 
civilization.

633
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:42,460
I think someone just put it on my 
facebook wall,

634
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:47,640
but basically the concept behind it is 
that right now we're moving from a type 

635
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,900
zero civilization to a type one 
civilization,

636
00:28:49,901 --> 00:28:54,040
which is we're going into a place where 
we're going to recognize that we're all,

637
00:28:54,041 --> 00:28:54,550
you know,
uh,

638
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:56,500
or planetary.
You know what I mean?

639
00:28:56,501 --> 00:29:01,501
We're a planetary civilization instead 
of broken up and all these weird 

640
00:29:01,501 --> 00:29:05,040
divergent pieces where they all speak 
different languages and we have these 

641
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:05,040
different beliefs.

642
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,510
We're moving into something where we're 
all connected via the internet,

643
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:13,230
but he said this is the most dangerous 
time possible because we're moving from 

644
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:17,560
type zero type one and the type zero 
people,

645
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:22,650
the ones with the crazy ideas,
they have nuclear weapons and so we're 

646
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:24,350
in a place where if we don't work this 
shit out there can be,

647
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:27,730
we can destroy ourselves,
but if we can get past these crazy ideas

648
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:33,030
that differentiate us,
that split us up the shit where people 

649
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:33,030
say like,
you know,

650
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:34,570
those marines just pissed on,
on,

651
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:37,360
uh,
on the Taliban that they shot.

652
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:41,050
And everybody got upset about that.
Everybody got upset about.

653
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:43,210
They got upset that they were pissing on
him.

654
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,300
They didn't get upset that they killed.
They were like,

655
00:29:46,301 --> 00:29:48,940
how could you urinate on bodies?
It's like,

656
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,300
you just blew fucking holes in the 
chest.

657
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:54,370
These men,
that's horrifying.

658
00:29:54,371 --> 00:29:55,660
That's awful.

659
00:29:55,900 --> 00:30:00,900
That's the worst still at a place right 
now where it's worse to piss on a dead 

660
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:01,510
body.
Then to make a dead body,

661
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:06,660
now when we get to a place where making 
a dead body has the same cultural 

662
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:10,201
resonance is pissing on one where it 
makes national news because one person 

663
00:30:10,201 --> 00:30:14,460
had the fucking insane idea of like 
shooting someone instead of working it 

664
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:18,211
out through language or talking it out.
That's when we're going to be in or 

665
00:30:18,211 --> 00:30:19,450
entering a new age and new if we can 
make it there.

666
00:30:19,451 --> 00:30:24,451
A new evolutionary period where we 
recognize that a solution to a problem 

667
00:30:24,451 --> 00:30:27,400
is never is never blasting people to 
smithereens.

668
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:32,580
And if it is,
it's so fucking rare that like it's the 

669
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,760
most rare thing.
It's only in the most rare situations,

670
00:30:33,761 --> 00:30:38,761
you know?
So I think that I think we're on the 

671
00:30:38,761 --> 00:30:40,360
verge of getting to this place and I 
think the Internet is helping.

672
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:45,630
I think every time you look at what 
happened with Sopa and Pipa and you see 

673
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:49,600
the power of this organizing force and 
logic seems to rule in the Internet.

674
00:30:49,601 --> 00:30:54,601
It's just logical people.
The logical majority seems to be making 

675
00:30:54,601 --> 00:30:56,980
things happen.
So if that happened on a planetary scale

676
00:30:57,190 --> 00:31:00,370
where instead of these fucking insane 
guys like the president of Syria,

677
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:03,160
good at freak.
If you seen that fucking guy,

678
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:04,450
he's insane.
He's insane.

679
00:31:04,451 --> 00:31:05,620
He's insane.
Dictator,

680
00:31:05,621 --> 00:31:10,621
you know,
it's like these people that wasn't a 

681
00:31:10,621 --> 00:31:10,720
move.
Mubarak and what's his name in Egypt?

682
00:31:10,721 --> 00:31:12,720
What was his name?
Mubarak was like,

683
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:18,520
guys,
you think it's okay to be president for 

684
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:18,520
40 years straight?
You know what I mean?

685
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:22,891
These fucking assholes.
Once we start getting them out of the 

686
00:31:22,891 --> 00:31:22,891
picture,
you know,

687
00:31:22,891 --> 00:31:26,371
and then move on to the fucking the 
clerics and the Prius two or like 

688
00:31:26,371 --> 00:31:29,130
teaching people that are the only way to
communicate with the university.

689
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:31,990
Connect with God.
Once we get rid of those motherfuckers.

690
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:34,750
This is pretty awesome planet man.
The resources thing.

691
00:31:34,751 --> 00:31:37,000
We can work it out.
We can work out the resources.

692
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,730
I think we could.
Smart.

693
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,130
I couldn't maybe,
but someone

694
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,250
love it.
Awesome.

695
00:31:41,251 --> 00:31:46,251
Optimistic view of the world.
If we could just all communicate in the 

696
00:31:46,251 --> 00:31:46,770
same native language so we could tell 
each other this.

697
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,750
Yeah.
That's a big part of the problem.

698
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,290
Be Part of the problem is if you were,
if there was some sort of a civil unrest

699
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:55,290
or some sort of a problem with another 
part of the country that was European,

700
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:57,750
we would get all the information back 
immediately.

701
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,550
What's going on?
Exactly what's going on.

702
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,430
Can you imagine like the United States 
was in Ireland for some reason.

703
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,870
Oh my God.
Wow.

704
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,630
It would be ridiculous.
You know,

705
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,460
and also this,
this level,

706
00:32:07,461 --> 00:32:09,750
this language,
this new language that I,

707
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:12,590
that it wouldn't just be us talking the 
same language.

708
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:16,900
It's a neurologically,
it's an,

709
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:21,930
it's a technological neurological 
interface that allows us to directly 

710
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:25,211
communicate emotion to each other 
because it's like imagine how many 

711
00:32:25,211 --> 00:32:28,601
stupid arguments you've gotten in like 
with your girlfriend or with your 

712
00:32:28,601 --> 00:32:28,601
friends that you.
It's,

713
00:32:28,601 --> 00:32:30,740
it just is about language.
We're underneath it.

714
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:32,900
You're just feeling the exact.
You're just like,

715
00:32:32,901 --> 00:32:35,280
I really want things to be okay and 
you're right.

716
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:40,350
You know what I mean?
So if you could just feel how that felt 

717
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:40,350
were,
because I mean,

718
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:44,861
think about it.
We're forced to articulate our universe 

719
00:32:44,861 --> 00:32:47,600
through the same fucking Oregon that we 
use to chew hamburgers.

720
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:51,500
That's our way of describing the entire,
it's the tip of our feeding tubes is how

721
00:32:51,501 --> 00:32:53,510
we're forced to describe the infinite.

722
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:58,720
We're fucking limited.
It's like in my left foot when the guy 

723
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,061
could only paint with his foot.
Remember that we have infinity out here 

724
00:33:01,061 --> 00:33:05,800
and all we have to access to,
to describe this infinity and our 

725
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:09,551
perception of it in the way it feels to 
be a part of it is a language that we 

726
00:33:09,551 --> 00:33:13,061
didn't come up with ourselves.
The language has been passed down in 

727
00:33:13,061 --> 00:33:13,061
his,
uh,

728
00:33:13,061 --> 00:33:14,660
you know,
it was a trade language.

729
00:33:14,661 --> 00:33:19,661
So a lot of the words that we have,
there might not be words that exist 

730
00:33:19,661 --> 00:33:23,321
right now to describe certain facets of 
reality and sometimes that'll make them 

731
00:33:23,321 --> 00:33:27,071
invisible.
But if you could undercut language and 

732
00:33:27,071 --> 00:33:29,561
just have a emotional fucking connection
where you could feel another person's 

733
00:33:29,561 --> 00:33:30,110
emotions.
I mean,

734
00:33:30,111 --> 00:33:33,260
imagine being the president of Syria and
you come in,

735
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:36,320
you the guide is like killing 
protesters,

736
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:38,720
you know,
jailing people and torturing them.

737
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,550
You take that guy and just for one 
second,

738
00:33:40,551 --> 00:33:45,551
he gets a feeling of what it's like to 
be out in the street or to be in a 

739
00:33:45,551 --> 00:33:48,521
country where you've had a president 
forever and you're being completely 

740
00:33:48,521 --> 00:33:48,980
repressed.
If he could feel that feeling,

741
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:51,710
you know what I mean?
It would be hard for him to continue on.

742
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:54,500
It will be hard for them to live and 
delusion and to think that,

743
00:33:54,501 --> 00:33:54,880
oh,
I see.

744
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,450
It's easy to be a tyrant.
I deserve this,

745
00:33:56,451 --> 00:34:01,451
or these people are less than me.
Slavery never would've been able to 

746
00:34:01,451 --> 00:34:04,721
happen.
Slavery was based on this ridiculous 

747
00:34:04,721 --> 00:34:05,240
idea that somehow black people deserve 
to be enslaved.

748
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:07,130
You know?
It's the same thing with eating meat.

749
00:34:07,131 --> 00:34:10,280
We believe that in general people one 
one way,

750
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:12,110
not everyone.
Some mediators are like,

751
00:34:12,111 --> 00:34:12,530
yeah,
I,

752
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,490
I'll,
I'll eat.

753
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:19,150
I eat meat and I know that these animals
have feelings and generally die of 

754
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:22,841
brutal life,
but I think I deserve to eat meat and I 

755
00:34:22,841 --> 00:34:22,841
think that's natural.

756
00:34:22,841 --> 00:34:23,960
That's the best rationale for eating 
meat.

757
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:29,160
That's it.
You acknowledge the suffering and pain 

758
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:29,330
you're causing and you do it and you do 
it because you think you deserve it,

759
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:33,710
but some people they think fucking 
animals are like clockwork things.

760
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:36,980
You know what I mean?
Like little mechanistic,

761
00:34:36,981 --> 00:34:39,830
like a wristwatch,
and they don't feel the same things that

762
00:34:39,831 --> 00:34:44,831
we feel and we'll never know that until 
we create a neurological interface with 

763
00:34:44,831 --> 00:34:46,640
animals in the moment you realized,
oh fuck man,

764
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:50,030
these cows,
they feel love.

765
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:55,300
They feel love for each other and fear 
and they fucking more than their kids.

766
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:57,590
Then when you sit down and eat a 
hamburger,

767
00:34:57,890 --> 00:35:00,290
it's going to be a much more intense 
experience.

768
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:02,540
It's maybe it'll make it taste better.
I don't know,

769
00:35:02,541 --> 00:35:07,541
but it's going to be this cow new love.
Do A.

770
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,660
is that all true what you said about 
the.

771
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:11,510
Well,
no,

772
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,030
I don't think we.
I don't think we can know that,

773
00:35:14,031 --> 00:35:16,110
but I think that there are like the,
my,

774
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:21,550
like when I was in India,
they like the cows kind of wander the 

775
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:21,550
streets and they don't.
They're not like,

776
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:26,760
you know,
they're not abused in the same way that 

777
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:26,760
they are here.
I'm sure there are some,

778
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,710
but the ones they're like,
they're like really sweet dogs.

779
00:35:27,711 --> 00:35:32,711
They'll come up to you and rub their 
muzzle against you and you can scratch 

780
00:35:32,711 --> 00:35:32,810
behind their ears and they're just very 
sweet.

781
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:38,050
I mean,
I'm not saying cows are fucking dolphin 

782
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:38,050
of cows.
Eventually evolve it.

783
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:38,050
Just get

784
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:42,780
a little bit smarter and learn how to 
speak English and then like start coming

785
00:35:42,781 --> 00:35:44,760
into people's houses and see all the 
leather shit.

786
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:49,680
What the fuck you,
you abandon you imagine?

787
00:35:49,681 --> 00:35:54,681
I mean we just assumed the cows are 
never going to evolve because of where 

788
00:35:54,681 --> 00:35:55,530
they are right now is where they are.
You know,

789
00:35:55,710 --> 00:36:00,120
we assume they're just gonna fucking eat
the grass and just be all stupid and not

790
00:36:00,121 --> 00:36:03,000
get anything done.
Just run around and make milk.

791
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,370
They started allowing them on buses.
Yeah.

792
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:05,760
What if,
what if,

793
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:08,310
what if something happens would have.
Maybe it's radiation.

794
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:13,700
Maybe it's like some fucking third world
country where we would make in Nike's 

795
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,730
and they did something to the water 
supply and it makes cow super smart.

796
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:19,230
Funny Dude.
Can you imagine that?

797
00:36:19,231 --> 00:36:21,060
The Lord Jesus Christ,
you have leather.

798
00:36:21,061 --> 00:36:24,840
Everything you fuckheads you think you 
think it's cool to have leather?

799
00:36:24,841 --> 00:36:29,841
Everything we have,
like the skin of a murdered animal is 

800
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:33,750
like standard on cars.
That's our favorite shit.

801
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:38,930
We want to sit down and flesh peeled 
flesh from an murdered animal is the 

802
00:36:39,391 --> 00:36:41,930
preferred seating choice.
Yeah.

803
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:46,960
That's how I like my seat covered.
I'd like affirm nice back of have 

804
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,890
murdered animal hide with minimal 
padding.

805
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:54,940
Yeah.
Isn't it odd though that like even if 

806
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:54,940
like I,
you know,

807
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:56,470
for if I died,
I mean maybe I'm wrong about this,

808
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:59,110
but if I put my will,
I want my,

809
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:04,230
I want my flesh cured and made into 
wallets for my friends.

810
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,810
I don't think I could legally do that.
I don't think you can do that.

811
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:09,510
You know?
I don't think you could do that either.

812
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:12,580
People that so superstitious and odd.

813
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:18,200
Well it is,
but you don't want to really open up 

814
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:21,651
that market.
You don't want to give any flashmarket 

815
00:37:21,651 --> 00:37:21,651
wallet market,
man.

816
00:37:21,651 --> 00:37:23,100
You don't even want to open that door.
Well,

817
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:28,310
I do.
You don't want have any of those out 

818
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:28,310
there.
You know why?

819
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:28,410
Because there's some one dude and he 
just,

820
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:31,380
he's going to get through this miserable
life in one piece,

821
00:37:31,381 --> 00:37:36,381
one way or another until one day he's at
the flea market and he finds a human 

822
00:37:36,381 --> 00:37:39,000
flesh wallet and that's it.
He's got to make human flesh everything.

823
00:37:39,001 --> 00:37:44,001
Boom.
Murder spree making human flesh 

824
00:37:44,001 --> 00:37:44,001
underwear.
Yeah.

825
00:37:44,001 --> 00:37:44,550
Not Good.
Yeah.

826
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:45,780
You don't want to encourage that kind of
shit.

827
00:37:45,781 --> 00:37:50,781
You can't have that out there.
You can't have human flesh wallets out 

828
00:37:50,781 --> 00:37:51,150
there.
People just to unpredictably fucked up.

829
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,080
I won't do it.
I will.

830
00:37:52,081 --> 00:37:57,081
I'll cancel my kickstarter account.
That's going to be a real problem and 

831
00:37:57,081 --> 00:38:00,341
it's not just communicating.
It's figuring out how to develop people 

832
00:38:00,341 --> 00:38:01,980
or redevelop them after they'd been 
fucked up as children,

833
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:05,460
that there's going to be something they 
figured some sort of a reset.

834
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:06,970
Well,
again,

835
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:12,060
if you can get an emotional read on a 
person like how they're experiencing 

836
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:15,241
reality,
then you can communicate with them much 

837
00:38:15,241 --> 00:38:15,241
better.
I mean some,

838
00:38:15,241 --> 00:38:15,241
some,
some,

839
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:19,540
some people are fucked.
Communicate

840
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:25,040
smart as a species.
That's one of the big things that we 

841
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,761
would do.
We would set up places where people who 

842
00:38:28,761 --> 00:38:31,601
had fucked her lives up can go and not 
be a criminal and get some food and have

843
00:38:33,961 --> 00:38:36,490
so many help them figure things out 
like,

844
00:38:36,491 --> 00:38:41,491
listen,
what do we know we can keep you from 

845
00:38:41,491 --> 00:38:41,740
going to jail for the rest of your life?
Let's let's work this out.

846
00:38:41,741 --> 00:38:44,830
Let's fucking figure you out a fucking 
career path here.

847
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,960
Help this dude.
Somebody helped.

848
00:38:46,961 --> 00:38:51,961
These people are obviously everybody's 
pulling yourself up by your own 

849
00:38:51,961 --> 00:38:54,190
bootstraps,
which I believe in for for most things.

850
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:56,500
For most things.
That would be the advice,

851
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:00,160
but occasionally there's some people 
that are a part of society.

852
00:39:00,161 --> 00:39:05,161
They're just,
they're handed the shittiest fucking 

853
00:39:05,161 --> 00:39:07,831
hand of cards ever in life and you know,
and then they find themselves in and out

854
00:39:08,321 --> 00:39:12,030
of the judicial system as a young kid 
and they find themselves in jail.

855
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:13,400
I mean,
it's like,

856
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:18,420
man,
you don't think that that dude somehow 

857
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:20,741
or another,
she didn't get a fair shake ever in his 

858
00:39:20,741 --> 00:39:20,741
whole life.
You know,

859
00:39:20,741 --> 00:39:22,950
and everybody just wants to just lock 
them up and put them in.

860
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:26,110
That's not the solution either.
The solution is how you fix them.

861
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:27,370
It's so weird,
man.

862
00:39:27,371 --> 00:39:32,371
It's like the vagina is an elevator door
that opens up into this dimension.

863
00:39:32,741 --> 00:39:36,970
And like sometimes that elevator puts 
you out on a bad fucking place.

864
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:41,860
That is one of the most brilliant things
you've ever said.

865
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:43,990
That elevator smells.
You gotta.

866
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,610
Remember that?
Somebody tweet that to doug.

867
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,080
I remember that.
That's a bit,

868
00:39:47,081 --> 00:39:48,520
dude.
I've been saying

869
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,580
some version of that but I'm not like 
that.

870
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:56,670
But.
So the idea is you get smashed out into 

871
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:56,670
the,
in some of these people get fucked up.

872
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:59,830
They get blasted out into a bad 
apartment surrounded by crackheads.

873
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:02,560
Deal.
It's terrifying.

874
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:03,340
Yeah man.
And,

875
00:40:03,341 --> 00:40:04,360
and,
and this fucking.

876
00:40:04,361 --> 00:40:07,900
What does this lead to?
This leads to what you're talking about.

877
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:10,150
These people who,
who have,

878
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:15,320
I mean,
imagine spending the first 12 years of 

879
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:18,970
your life before you went into a foster 
home with the most neurons when you're,

880
00:40:18,971 --> 00:40:19,990
uh,
when you're a baby,

881
00:40:19,991 --> 00:40:22,970
as more neurons in their brain than at 
any other time in their life.

882
00:40:22,971 --> 00:40:25,420
So you're like,
as a wax seal,

883
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:30,510
a baby's brain is like a wax seal and 
the fucking family is like the ring that

884
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:32,170
you know,
they pushed into like,

885
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:37,350
you know,
and like in the fucking like medieval 

886
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:39,151
times.
It's like we get imprinted and we can't 

887
00:40:39,151 --> 00:40:41,680
resist it by the vibrational frequencies
that were around when we're,

888
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:44,060
when we're blasted into this dimension 
and,

889
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:47,170
and you need help to get those things 
transformed.

890
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:50,530
Like you can't just do it on your own.
The record's been pressed,

891
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:55,531
man.
You need help to fucking overcome the 

892
00:40:55,531 --> 00:40:58,711
weird patterns that come from living 
next to the lunatics that were your 

893
00:40:58,711 --> 00:40:58,960
parents.
Not everyone had crazy parents,

894
00:40:58,961 --> 00:41:03,961
but many people had fucked up parents.
They were giving like think about how 

895
00:41:05,771 --> 00:41:06,850
young.
I mean,

896
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:10,630
I think our younger parents were when 
they had you think about that,

897
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:11,790
where they are in their twenties.
Joe,

898
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:14,400
my,
when my mother was 21 when she had me.

899
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:19,270
When was the last time you talked to a 
21 year old last night for am.

900
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:27,880
That's all I needed to know.
Brian lives in that world.

901
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:34,110
He lives in the world of.
He's the only 37 year old man I know 

902
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:34,110
that uses the word like

903
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,800
I've,
I'm guilty.

904
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:37,380
I'm like,
this guy's like,

905
00:41:37,381 --> 00:41:38,690
and I'm like,
get out here.

906
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,630
And I do that.
I liked it.

907
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:42,630
I do the likes,
man.

908
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:47,730
I,
I listened to these youtube videos 

909
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:47,730
sometimes people make in a year,
might lag,

910
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:49,950
lag lag.
It makes me want to.

911
00:41:49,951 --> 00:41:50,750
So my lip.

912
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:54,740
Well that's a cool thing about podcasts 
is you get to find out how annoying your

913
00:41:54,741 --> 00:41:59,741
personality really is.
The annoying aspects of it gets 

914
00:41:59,741 --> 00:41:59,741
highlighted.

915
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:01,240
Yeah.
I just get back in your face.

916
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:03,250
It's good to see.
It really is.

917
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,170
There's A.
I've read this,

918
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:09,370
there's an interesting essay that this 
guy got the weirdest name.

919
00:42:09,371 --> 00:42:11,350
His name's Suzanne and he's,
uh,

920
00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:17,610
he's like,
I don't know the exact word for what he 

921
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:19,261
is,
but he's like an anarchist primitive as 

922
00:42:19,261 --> 00:42:21,131
he thinks.
Everything started going bad when we 

923
00:42:21,131 --> 00:42:24,880
started using symbols to represent 
reality instead of just being in reality

924
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:28,330
when the moment you start using symbols 
to represent reality,

925
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:32,680
you're kind of boxing reality in and 
you're separating yourself.

926
00:42:32,681 --> 00:42:34,870
You're creating the separation from you 
and the universe.

927
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:39,820
And so he was talking about the growing 
use of the term,

928
00:42:39,821 --> 00:42:43,510
like how people use the word,
like instead of just saying what it is,

929
00:42:43,511 --> 00:42:48,511
so you know,
it's like you're walking outside and 

930
00:42:48,511 --> 00:42:48,511
you're like,
come up to this thing and you're like.

931
00:42:48,511 --> 00:42:51,570
And he says,
what that is is this subconscious 

932
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:54,520
problem where people are not directly 
experiencing reality.

933
00:42:54,521 --> 00:42:57,910
So everything's like something else.
Things aren't being,

934
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:03,120
things are being like something else.
It's very curious that it's pretty good 

935
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:03,340
if you look up Suzanne,
that's,

936
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:05,380
it's,
it's a little fucking dense,

937
00:43:05,381 --> 00:43:10,381
but it's a pretty good essay.
Have you ever hung out with guys a hate 

938
00:43:10,381 --> 00:43:13,210
symbols that hate symbols and drums?

939
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:17,170
No.
To either one of those instruments?

940
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:18,700
Well,
you know,

941
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:19,620
it's weird.
You know,

942
00:43:19,621 --> 00:43:24,621
I'm,
one of the things that I always thought 

943
00:43:24,621 --> 00:43:26,160
it was fascinating about ancient 
Egyptian hieroglyphs is that they,

944
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:29,320
they had a completely different way of 
writing things.

945
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:32,840
So they must've had a completely 
different way of talking dip,

946
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:37,860
completely different way of phrasing 
things.

947
00:43:38,081 --> 00:43:38,770
And uh,
and you,

948
00:43:38,771 --> 00:43:39,310
you,
you,

949
00:43:39,370 --> 00:43:43,030
you,
when you look at like how you could be a

950
00:43:43,031 --> 00:43:45,490
human being,
obviously an intelligent human being,

951
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:50,960
advanced sophisticated culture,
capable of producing amazing works of 

952
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:54,571
art,
but that language is like totally alien 

953
00:43:54,571 --> 00:43:55,840
to us.
Like we look at it and like what is this

954
00:43:55,841 --> 00:44:00,841
crazy chicken scratch and pictures of 
birds and shit and these fucking people,

955
00:44:01,001 --> 00:44:03,190
this is what they use to describe the 
world.

956
00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:06,430
But somehow or another to them it 
worked.

957
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:07,290
Like they,
they,

958
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:12,510
they,
they thought of things like in a 

959
00:44:12,510 --> 00:44:12,510
different way.
Their,

960
00:44:12,510 --> 00:44:13,000
their language,
their written language consisted of like

961
00:44:13,001 --> 00:44:14,180
symbols.
Yeah.

962
00:44:14,370 --> 00:44:14,980
You know,
not,

963
00:44:15,010 --> 00:44:16,820
not like ours but like,
you know,

964
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:19,960
but like images,
really fascinating shit.

965
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:20,950
Yeah,
it is.

966
00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:26,090
Languages is one of the most fascinating
things to think about when you're 

967
00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:30,991
tripping.
Like it's fun to contemplate where each 

968
00:44:30,991 --> 00:44:32,790
word is coming from,
like the transformation

969
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:36,660
of the thought into the word and how 
instantaneous that happened.

970
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:39,180
So when you start contemplating where at
where's this,

971
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:41,640
where's this language coming from?
I don't even think about this.

972
00:44:41,641 --> 00:44:43,110
It just,
it just happened.

973
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:45,660
And for the longest time,
for the longest time,

974
00:44:45,661 --> 00:44:49,110
people have always been aware that one 
of the big things that keeps people from

975
00:44:49,111 --> 00:44:52,260
really directly communicating with 
everybody is the language barrier.

976
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:57,280
Yes.
I mean that's why the myth of the Tower 

977
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:57,280
of Babel existed,
that,

978
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:00,810
that,
that was like a plan to give us all 

979
00:45:00,810 --> 00:45:03,651
different languages so we can never 
fucking figure out how to communicate 

980
00:45:03,651 --> 00:45:06,411
with each other.
Which is really fascinating because it 

981
00:45:06,411 --> 00:45:09,810
really would make sense.
Like if someone had that kind of power,

982
00:45:09,811 --> 00:45:14,811
if we lose like a warlock who could just
go and we'll give everyone a different 

983
00:45:14,811 --> 00:45:15,570
language.
God,

984
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,650
that would be a good move.
If you really could do that.

985
00:45:19,651 --> 00:45:22,410
I mean if it was that easy to be the 
architect of reality,

986
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:24,810
that would be a good move.
You don't want them to rally up.

987
00:45:24,811 --> 00:45:28,680
We'll have them all live in these little
spots and give him the fucking languages

988
00:45:28,681 --> 00:45:29,940
and shit.
No one understands what you're

989
00:45:30,370 --> 00:45:32,220
say.
If I went over to God's house,

990
00:45:32,221 --> 00:45:37,221
like if there's a lot of God's living in
the same neighborhood and they all have 

991
00:45:37,221 --> 00:45:37,221
these little aquarium earth they're 
fucking with,

992
00:45:37,221 --> 00:45:39,000
none of them were shy.
Went over to a fucking.

993
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:43,200
Got The God's House that did that.
Feel like you're a dick man.

994
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:45,780
Let them speak the same language and 
have fun.

995
00:45:45,781 --> 00:45:50,781
Why are you?
Why do you consistently fuck with these 

996
00:45:50,781 --> 00:45:50,781
people?
You got to give them a break.

997
00:45:50,781 --> 00:45:55,700
I,
you know what I call animal control on 

998
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:55,700
God.
Like look at it.

999
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:59,661
Look like if you believe the concept of 
God and really think about like the 

1000
00:45:59,661 --> 00:46:01,710
fundamentalist Christian concept of God,
if this,

1001
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:04,560
if any,
if someone was doing that to animals,

1002
00:46:04,561 --> 00:46:09,561
what God is apparently doing to us 
according to the fundamentalist 

1003
00:46:09,561 --> 00:46:10,320
Christians,
he would go to jail for a long time.

1004
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:13,620
Anonymous would fucking attacking God's 
a sadist.

1005
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:17,610
He's like taking gay people,
burning them in hell forever.

1006
00:46:17,730 --> 00:46:21,090
He's like giving cancer to people 
because they deserve it.

1007
00:46:21,091 --> 00:46:24,750
He makes people go blind.
He turned a whole city in the Bible.

1008
00:46:24,751 --> 00:46:27,330
That salt or something.
Yeah,

1009
00:46:27,331 --> 00:46:29,150
he did a lot of creepy shit.
He's a creep.

1010
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:32,250
There's no other way around it.
There's no other way around it.

1011
00:46:32,251 --> 00:46:33,900
There's better ways to deal with it.

1012
00:46:33,910 --> 00:46:36,190
People you don't understand.
Dunkin,

1013
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:41,250
the Lord has a plan in all the Ode to 
you in your mind.

1014
00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:47,050
You believe you have it all figured out 
and then you're smarter than the Lower 

1015
00:46:47,050 --> 00:46:47,530
Nicei.
That's not possible.

1016
00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:50,280
You're a talker,
you're a mocker.

1017
00:46:50,281 --> 00:46:51,090
I can remember this.

1018
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:54,200
You're thinking too much.
They get mad at you.

1019
00:46:54,490 --> 00:46:56,310
Well,
can I have questions?

1020
00:46:56,350 --> 00:47:01,350
That's not what.
That's not what you shouldn't use your 

1021
00:47:01,350 --> 00:47:01,350
mind for that.
You got to let God be scripture sales,

1022
00:47:01,350 --> 00:47:06,170
right?
Scripture say he who walk with me walk 

1023
00:47:06,550 --> 00:47:09,360
with the Lord will say shit like that.
And he goes,

1024
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:13,240
what does that even mean?
What the fuck does that mean?

1025
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:14,350
Well,
I mean,

1026
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:19,440
what it means.
That means that's the dude with the 

1027
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:19,440
mushrooms.

1028
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:19,440
Well,
yeah,

1029
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,080
right?
Yeah,

1030
00:47:20,110 --> 00:47:20,620
yeah,
yeah.

1031
00:47:20,990 --> 00:47:23,140
It's.
So that's the sad thing is these,

1032
00:47:23,170 --> 00:47:28,170
there's a great book called,
it's by Abraham maslow and it's called 

1033
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:32,821
religious values and peak and it talks 
about a theoretical,

1034
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:37,720
the theory,
the theory of how a religion happens and

1035
00:47:37,721 --> 00:47:42,721
the progression of information as it 
goes from being someone who's really 

1036
00:47:42,721 --> 00:47:45,610
happy to it being a priest class that's 
controlling people.

1037
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:50,820
And so his idea is certain people 
throughout time have had peak 

1038
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:54,181
experiences where they break through 
that particular ego barrier created by 

1039
00:47:54,551 --> 00:47:59,551
the Zeitgeists of their time.
They have a direct communication with 

1040
00:47:59,551 --> 00:48:01,660
some kind of like super ideas,
superintelligence,

1041
00:48:01,661 --> 00:48:04,420
whatever you want to call it.
They get really happy,

1042
00:48:04,421 --> 00:48:09,421
happy in a way.
Not just like someone who's having a 

1043
00:48:09,421 --> 00:48:09,421
good day,
but in a way where if you ran into them,

1044
00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:12,280
you would recognize it.
They'd figured something out.

1045
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:17,580
So that person gets a group of people 
around him who are kind of magnetized by

1046
00:48:17,741 --> 00:48:21,730
the energy and by what they're saying 
and they're talking about are a real way

1047
00:48:21,731 --> 00:48:23,950
that you can live and actually be happy 
in the world.

1048
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:26,260
And those people from being around 
someone who's like,

1049
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:31,380
you know,
like in sports they used to say you can 

1050
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:35,791
own a five minute mile,
you could only run a mile and this 

1051
00:48:35,791 --> 00:48:38,371
amount of time.
And everyone thought that everyone was 

1052
00:48:38,371 --> 00:48:38,371
doing that.
And then right when someone broke it,

1053
00:48:38,371 --> 00:48:39,520
all of a sudden everyone started 
breaking.

1054
00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:40,090
It's like,
Oh yeah,

1055
00:48:40,091 --> 00:48:45,091
I could do that.
So in the same way these certain people 

1056
00:48:45,091 --> 00:48:47,470
will overcome a specific,
you know,

1057
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:51,610
a phantom of their time,
which is causing them to be miserable.

1058
00:48:51,790 --> 00:48:56,790
Those people get people around them will
also get this certain level of 

1059
00:48:56,790 --> 00:48:58,150
happiness.
The person who came up with the original

1060
00:48:58,151 --> 00:49:03,151
idea dies.
Now he's just got the disciples and the 

1061
00:49:03,151 --> 00:49:05,971
disciples that people around them and 
they transmit this idea to the people 

1062
00:49:05,971 --> 00:49:06,730
are on him.
But now it's a little diluted in some of

1063
00:49:06,731 --> 00:49:08,230
the people we were doing and aren't 
quite,

1064
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:09,970
aren't really quite happy.

1065
00:49:09,970 --> 00:49:12,910
They're not doing it right.
So you pass that down,

1066
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:16,780
keeps getting water,
getting watered and watered and watered.

1067
00:49:16,930 --> 00:49:18,770
And then the next thing you know,
you just,

1068
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:20,860
you,
you have like some fucking,

1069
00:49:20,861 --> 00:49:25,861
like old horny man with his pants down,
just nailing a toddler and a confession 

1070
00:49:27,131 --> 00:49:28,180
booth and,
and,

1071
00:49:28,181 --> 00:49:29,860
and that,
that's the end result.

1072
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:35,010
Starts off with this super happy guy,
ends up with a fucking pedophile dress 

1073
00:49:35,010 --> 00:49:38,380
like a god clown with his cock and a 
kid's ass.

1074
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:40,840
That's how,
that's how mutated things get.

1075
00:49:40,841 --> 00:49:45,841
Which is why it's very funny that people
feel so desperate to cling onto this old

1076
00:49:46,451 --> 00:49:48,190
thing instead of thinking,
wait,

1077
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:53,460
there might be a new thing that we can 
come up with based on all the 

1078
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:53,770
information we have right now.
The end

1079
00:49:53,770 --> 00:49:58,770
of the day,
it's all shit that was written down by 

1080
00:49:58,770 --> 00:49:59,100
people at the end of the day.
Yeah.

1081
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:04,170
And why would we ever think that the 
people who lived thousands of years ago 

1082
00:50:04,211 --> 00:50:04,930
had it?
Right.

1083
00:50:05,590 --> 00:50:06,580
Okay.
Why?

1084
00:50:06,730 --> 00:50:10,690
Why would you want to believe that?
There might be information there that we

1085
00:50:10,691 --> 00:50:15,691
could use and could help us.
But the most important thing is to know 

1086
00:50:15,691 --> 00:50:16,460
what we know now.
Yes.

1087
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:18,130
No.
What do we know now?

1088
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:20,320
And let's figure this fucking thing out 
together.

1089
00:50:20,590 --> 00:50:21,970
That's right.
Following some.

1090
00:50:21,971 --> 00:50:24,250
Any crazy shit.
Anything.

1091
00:50:24,251 --> 00:50:26,590
I don't care what it is.
Judaism,

1092
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:28,790
Christianity,
Muslim.

1093
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,050
What do you want to be?
What do you want to be?

1094
00:50:30,051 --> 00:50:31,060
I want to be a car.
Krishna.

1095
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:32,330
It's awesome.
It's all the same.

1096
00:50:32,331 --> 00:50:35,060
It's all something that someone put put 
together.

1097
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:36,920
What?
The message behind it.

1098
00:50:36,921 --> 00:50:38,480
Who?
Who knows if it's right.

1099
00:50:38,481 --> 00:50:41,320
Who knows if it's wrong.
Who knows if there really is a,

1100
00:50:41,330 --> 00:50:43,610
an actual man,
the fucking clouds.

1101
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:46,010
And in the biblical sense,
who the fuck knows?

1102
00:50:46,011 --> 00:50:46,390
I mean,
I,

1103
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:51,510
I.
It doesn't seem likely to me based on 

1104
00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:52,700
what I've experienced in my life,
but if it is going to be pissed,

1105
00:50:52,701 --> 00:50:57,701
but even if it is,
I mean the university is fucking so 

1106
00:50:57,701 --> 00:50:57,701
bizarre.
The.

1107
00:50:57,701 --> 00:51:02,190
Yeah.
Just the idea of the infinite space is 

1108
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:02,570
so bizarre that a guy in the clouds with
a horrible.

1109
00:51:02,571 --> 00:51:04,220
Why is that so weird?
I mean,

1110
00:51:04,221 --> 00:51:05,120
yeah,
why not?

1111
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:06,950
Fucking why not?
Why not?

1112
00:51:06,951 --> 00:51:11,951
Why not?
There'd be one guy that's running the 

1113
00:51:11,951 --> 00:51:11,951
whole fucking.
What the fuck you,

1114
00:51:11,951 --> 00:51:16,140
you know,
it sounds crazy that there could be a 

1115
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:16,310
heaven,
a pearly gates and shit,

1116
00:51:16,311 --> 00:51:19,340
and you get up there and there's dudes 
wearing white and everybody's floating.

1117
00:51:19,670 --> 00:51:22,490
But imagine if it was true.
Imagine if you got up,

1118
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:23,690
you,
I wouldn't.

1119
00:51:23,691 --> 00:51:28,691
That is not to me nearly as shocking.
Heaven is not nearly as shocking as the 

1120
00:51:28,691 --> 00:51:29,120
universe itself.

1121
00:51:29,130 --> 00:51:29,660
Well,
I,

1122
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:34,700
I think that it's what we're talking 
about here is that the ability to 

1123
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:36,540
describe reality and to,
and to uh,

1124
00:51:36,550 --> 00:51:41,550
understand reality.
It keeps increasing as we evolve as a 

1125
00:51:41,550 --> 00:51:43,910
species.
So a really smart people and you know,

1126
00:51:44,170 --> 00:51:47,760
in every single time there's been very 
smart people at every single time,

1127
00:51:47,770 --> 00:51:52,770
really smart people in different ways,
but their ability to describe reality 

1128
00:51:52,770 --> 00:51:57,420
was limited to the language available to
them and the technology that was around 

1129
00:51:57,420 --> 00:51:57,420
them at the time.
I mean,

1130
00:51:57,420 --> 00:51:58,800
if you look at like,
Shit,

1131
00:51:58,801 --> 00:52:00,480
man,
I hope you remember this because there's

1132
00:52:00,481 --> 00:52:05,481
a book in the Old Testament that is in 
my mind is clearly a Ufo encounter.

1133
00:52:06,421 --> 00:52:11,421
I think it's not leviticus,
it's as equal.

1134
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:14,370
Now you look at that and what is the guy
who used to describe this thing?

1135
00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:16,360
We'll within the Marriott's.
Yeah,

1136
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:20,790
wheels and chariots and just the shit 
that's available to him to describe this

1137
00:52:20,791 --> 00:52:24,390
experience that he had now.
Now if someone saw that same thing,

1138
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:24,840
they'd be like,
yeah,

1139
00:52:24,841 --> 00:52:27,720
I got sucked up by a Ufo.
They gave me a psychedelic.

1140
00:52:27,721 --> 00:52:30,720
I saw something that's coming which is 
relevant

1141
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:35,800
or period coconut felon that 
motherfucker's head and sparks were 

1142
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:38,090
flying and he didn't know what happened.
He woke up in a ditch with a bloody head

1143
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:41,360
with a have been loosening far.

1144
00:52:41,550 --> 00:52:44,460
It could have been allison nation and 
and people just believed it,

1145
00:52:44,610 --> 00:52:49,610
but I think that,
I mean outside of religious 

1146
00:52:49,610 --> 00:52:50,460
hallucinations or visions and people 
trying to describe it,

1147
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:55,820
everyone's limited to the tools that 
they have around them to observe reality

1148
00:52:57,151 --> 00:53:00,000
and they can only report on reality 
based on the tools that they had

1149
00:53:00,290 --> 00:53:02,060
and the experiences that they have to 
draw upon.

1150
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:07,480
Which is one of the reasons why the 
whole Ufo thing seemed so preposterous 

1151
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:08,210
to people.
It's so we don't have that experience to

1152
00:53:08,211 --> 00:53:12,140
draw upon the experience of an alien 
intelligent life form.

1153
00:53:12,141 --> 00:53:14,510
It's like looking back at us while we're
looking at it,

1154
00:53:14,930 --> 00:53:19,930
I don't think.
I think 90 percent of the people on the 

1155
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:20,510
planet which is die of a heart attack,
like immediately,

1156
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:22,270
boom,
to fucking explode.

1157
00:53:22,271 --> 00:53:27,271
Yeah.
If aliens came and they were super 

1158
00:53:27,271 --> 00:53:27,880
intelligent with big fucking gray heads 
and those giant black guys,

1159
00:53:27,910 --> 00:53:32,250
they can totally read your mind and they
were all just like floating and freezing

1160
00:53:32,251 --> 00:53:36,960
people and erasing memories and shit.
Like all these Travis Walton stories.

1161
00:53:36,961 --> 00:53:41,961
You know that guy that if that's all,
if that were to actually happen,

1162
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:44,310
I don't think the human race would 
survive.

1163
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:46,070
I think we,
we can't serve.

1164
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:51,080
We're the alpha.
We can't exist in a world where we're 

1165
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:53,340
under the thumb of some incredibly 
intelligent,

1166
00:53:53,341 --> 00:53:58,341
super sophisticated alien life form that
thinks in a completely different way 

1167
00:53:58,341 --> 00:54:00,270
than us and can control matter.

1168
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:01,490
Well,
you know man,

1169
00:54:01,491 --> 00:54:02,020
I,
I always,

1170
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:07,040
I have this optimistic idea of actual 
matter like I'm working writing for the 

1171
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:07,040
x amount.
It's not going to.

1172
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:09,400
I don't think it's going to come from 
the sky and the silver ships.

1173
00:54:09,401 --> 00:54:14,401
I think the way it goes down is it maybe
all of a sudden you kind of.

1174
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:20,740
We as a species get to a point where we 
kind of realized we remember actually 

1175
00:54:21,081 --> 00:54:26,081
what's going on.
I think right now we have a little bit 

1176
00:54:26,081 --> 00:54:26,081
of Amnesia.
We have lost a,

1177
00:54:26,081 --> 00:54:28,640
a,
a sense of like what truly is happening.

1178
00:54:28,641 --> 00:54:31,700
I think when you take a really potent 
psychedelic,

1179
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:36,880
sometimes you'll see this universe that 
already is around you that's already 

1180
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:41,231
happening around you at all times.
You get a sense all of a sudden that 

1181
00:54:41,231 --> 00:54:44,210
you've been there before and then it 
goes away.

1182
00:54:44,510 --> 00:54:49,510
But it seems like we're more like 
getting projected into this reality with

1183
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:51,650
awful amnesia.
For some,

1184
00:54:51,710 --> 00:54:52,990
I don't know what it's for.
It could be,

1185
00:54:52,991 --> 00:54:55,420
it could be just a video game.
Could be a,

1186
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:59,240
uh,
a sadistic joke could be a prank.

1187
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:04,720
This could be a prank that one super 
intelligent entities playing on another 

1188
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:05,660
superintelligent enemy entity.
It could be anything.

1189
00:55:05,950 --> 00:55:10,950
Or it can be a novelty creating machine.
Like on Mckenna thought that the 

1190
00:55:12,071 --> 00:55:17,071
universe is a novelty creating and 
harvesting machine and that we as the 

1191
00:55:17,741 --> 00:55:22,741
most complex organisms possibly in the 
universe where we're at at the pinnacle 

1192
00:55:23,410 --> 00:55:26,350
of this novelty creation.
Yeah,

1193
00:55:26,351 --> 00:55:27,530
man.
That's like,

1194
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:29,800
that's.
That's the whole reason for it all.

1195
00:55:29,930 --> 00:55:32,410
It seems chaotic to us and say,
look,

1196
00:55:32,411 --> 00:55:34,140
this is preposterous.
We should know better,

1197
00:55:34,141 --> 00:55:38,260
but it's almost like in our instincts as
an organism,

1198
00:55:38,350 --> 00:55:42,400
we have a direction to go and the 
direction is not spiritual.

1199
00:55:42,401 --> 00:55:44,230
It's technological.
That's it.

1200
00:55:44,290 --> 00:55:47,530
People are not looking for some sort of 
a spiritual release and some sort of a,

1201
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:51,070
a,
a broader perspective on the universe in

1202
00:55:51,071 --> 00:55:52,990
an objective view of life.
No.

1203
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:56,680
They're looking to see if they can punch
a hole through the center of space.

1204
00:55:57,610 --> 00:56:02,610
You know what I mean?
It's those real height of progress is 

1205
00:56:02,610 --> 00:56:06,061
not a complete overhauling and 
understanding of the educational system 

1206
00:56:06,061 --> 00:56:10,471
of the way to develop human minds,
the way to stop people from harming each

1207
00:56:10,571 --> 00:56:14,440
other instead of devoting all of our 
resources to evolving socially.

1208
00:56:14,590 --> 00:56:16,930
If it even is possible ever.
Instead of doing that

1209
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:18,350
well,
one,

1210
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:23,400
one thing you can do is instead of when 
you think about the passage of time as 

1211
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:24,400
we move into the future,
if you like,

1212
00:56:24,401 --> 00:56:25,960
get out of your head,
this idea,

1213
00:56:25,961 --> 00:56:30,961
it's like running down a race track or 
something like you're running down a 

1214
00:56:30,961 --> 00:56:33,130
track and think of it more in the sense 
of a revealing is happening.

1215
00:56:33,131 --> 00:56:38,131
So as we progress into the future,
more things begin to emerge into this 

1216
00:56:38,131 --> 00:56:42,661
reality that weren't there before.
Like we go from having stone tools to 

1217
00:56:42,661 --> 00:56:44,200
all of a sudden having a,
you know,

1218
00:56:44,201 --> 00:56:47,350
iron tools and then we go from that to 
all of a sudden you know,

1219
00:56:47,351 --> 00:56:52,351
where we are now,
where we're surrounded by fucking 

1220
00:56:52,351 --> 00:56:54,811
silver,
glowing macintosh computers and like 

1221
00:56:54,811 --> 00:56:58,770
microphones that are somehow recording 
our voice and these things keep getting 

1222
00:56:58,770 --> 00:57:02,671
revealed more and more and more.
And any of these items should you take 

1223
00:57:02,671 --> 00:57:05,200
them back 100 years,
people would think it was a Ufo.

1224
00:57:05,410 --> 00:57:07,720
They'd see it and think that fell out of
a space ship.

1225
00:57:07,930 --> 00:57:10,360
So all of a sudden you realize,
and maybe Mckenna said this,

1226
00:57:11,050 --> 00:57:12,310
I think he may have said something like 
this,

1227
00:57:12,311 --> 00:57:15,010
but the idea is the spaceship,
the alien,

1228
00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:20,430
the extra terrestrial intelligence.
It's growing around us like crystals 

1229
00:57:20,430 --> 00:57:21,940
when you were a kid and you're growing 
crystals,

1230
00:57:22,090 --> 00:57:27,090
but it's growing in the form of 
technology that eventually is going on 

1231
00:57:27,090 --> 00:57:28,690
to become self aware,
which is why I heard this awesome thing,

1232
00:57:28,691 --> 00:57:33,691
which is the first alien contact that we
have is going to be a computer that 

1233
00:57:34,901 --> 00:57:39,901
wakes up,
that's going to be our first 

1234
00:57:39,901 --> 00:57:39,901
communication with another 
consciousness.

1235
00:57:39,901 --> 00:57:41,020
Not something from the great void of 
space,

1236
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:43,360
but something that grew through time.
I

1237
00:57:43,580 --> 00:57:45,800
say,
I said that's totally possible,

1238
00:57:45,801 --> 00:57:48,410
but I don't say not something from 
space.

1239
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:50,990
So as it could be something from space.
Yeah,

1240
00:57:51,170 --> 00:57:53,320
that's possible too.
I hope it is.

1241
00:57:53,330 --> 00:57:55,820
It could be that the first Ufo or the 
first,

1242
00:57:56,180 --> 00:57:56,680
you know,
uh,

1243
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:59,750
the first real intelligence that we 
encountered this greater than our own is

1244
00:57:59,751 --> 00:58:03,020
something that we create ourselves at 
replicates itself through us.

1245
00:58:03,050 --> 00:58:08,050
Like very quickly.
Like that was the idea that once a 

1246
00:58:08,050 --> 00:58:10,751
computer becomes the real issue is going
to be that they're going to be able to 

1247
00:58:10,751 --> 00:58:13,681
live.
This is a stupid fucking design who 

1248
00:58:13,681 --> 00:58:13,681
built me and then they build something 
like way better.

1249
00:58:13,681 --> 00:58:17,651
That's it.
Instantly they know exactly how to put 

1250
00:58:17,651 --> 00:58:20,231
it together once they and you know the 
idea of programming emotions and 

1251
00:58:20,231 --> 00:58:24,830
programming are a million system of,
of dealing with babies and puppies and 

1252
00:58:25,551 --> 00:58:26,980
little baby chickie's and shit.

1253
00:58:27,140 --> 00:58:32,140
They won't have any of that guilt or 
weird feeling about biological life and 

1254
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:36,071
they might just say,
look at these fucking assholes shitting 

1255
00:58:36,071 --> 00:58:38,441
all over this planet.
We can't even use half of the resources 

1256
00:58:38,441 --> 00:58:40,100
on the planet because it's fuck heads 
have blown up nuclear bombs.

1257
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:45,700
Nuclear waste and holes were like cats 
will like take our nuclear ships and we 

1258
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:47,930
just throw them in a hole and then we 
cover over.

1259
00:58:47,931 --> 00:58:52,931
It was like stupid cats at the top of 
the heap of technological innovation and

1260
00:58:55,431 --> 00:59:00,431
science.
The best way to get rid of nuclear 

1261
00:59:00,431 --> 00:59:00,431
waste.
Besides shooting it at other planets,

1262
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:03,980
could you imagine what assholes we would
be considered in the universe?

1263
00:59:04,070 --> 00:59:07,910
If we just shot our nuclear waste up 
into space like a rocket,

1264
00:59:08,110 --> 00:59:10,520
you know,
we send it out with the voyager to crash

1265
00:59:10,521 --> 00:59:14,510
lands on someone's fucking moon someday,
or what if it starts some future war?

1266
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:17,780
They think it's a bomb we send,
we shoot nuclear waste.

1267
00:59:17,781 --> 00:59:22,781
There were just.
Apparently it's very devastating to 

1268
00:59:22,781 --> 00:59:22,781
their particular kills,

1269
00:59:22,781 --> 00:59:23,870
like 80 percent of the people on the 
planet,

1270
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:29,140
the rest they get together on giant bow 
ships and had to earth so fucking good 

1271
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:29,660
movies.
Somebody make that,

1272
00:59:29,990 --> 00:59:32,720
make that movie.
Would they,

1273
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:35,690
could they show shoot nuclear waste in 
this space?

1274
00:59:35,691 --> 00:59:36,640
Can they do that?
Well,

1275
00:59:36,670 --> 00:59:39,700
it gets stuck in the problem with that.
Is it my.

1276
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:40,910
Yeah,
I'm sure you could,

1277
00:59:40,911 --> 00:59:44,600
but it would take.
It takes so much energy to get it out of

1278
00:59:44,601 --> 00:59:49,601
the orbit of the planet that it ends up 
becoming less efficient to use nuclear 

1279
00:59:49,761 --> 00:59:50,180
energy.
You know,

1280
00:59:50,181 --> 00:59:52,040
they blew up a bomb in the,
uh,

1281
00:59:52,050 --> 00:59:55,280
the atmospheric operation,
I believe.

1282
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:56,870
I think it was called operation 
starfish.

1283
00:59:56,871 --> 00:59:59,370
Prime Corner knows the name of it.
Yeah.

1284
01:00:00,010 --> 01:00:03,530
Let me Google that.
So don't starfish prime day involved?

1285
01:00:03,610 --> 01:00:04,100
No,
no,

1286
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:05,090
no.
For real man,

1287
01:00:05,091 --> 01:00:09,440
they they decided to shoot a fucking 
nuclear warhead.

1288
01:00:11,380 --> 01:00:16,380
The ionosphere wouldn't like fuck up 
some kind of rotation or something or 

1289
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:16,430
possibly.

1290
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:18,350
Well,
you don't want it to fall back.

1291
01:00:18,351 --> 01:00:18,670
Yeah.
Oh,

1292
01:00:18,750 --> 01:00:21,590
you mean blowing up a fucking in the 
atmosphere?

1293
01:00:21,740 --> 01:00:23,780
I think at that time they didn't really 
know what it was.

1294
01:00:24,010 --> 01:00:25,010
What did I say?
What's prime?

1295
01:00:25,011 --> 01:00:25,790
What?
Oh,

1296
01:00:25,791 --> 01:00:27,290
fuck.
Something primed.

1297
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:32,120
I starfish starfish.
That sounds like initiate starfish.

1298
01:00:32,250 --> 01:00:34,820
Primary daughters get album,
doesn't it?

1299
01:00:36,020 --> 01:00:38,330
It's a good nickname for somebody 
starfish.

1300
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:39,240
Pretty good.
Lipiscan.

1301
01:00:39,250 --> 01:00:43,240
It's like a nickname for a stripper and 
as karate and I was like a weed street.

1302
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:44,480
Wow.
Wow.

1303
01:00:44,481 --> 01:00:48,230
One of five high altitude tests.
She's Christ.

1304
01:00:48,830 --> 01:00:53,830
They shot a bunch of fucking nuclear 
bombs up in the space just to see what 

1305
01:00:53,830 --> 01:00:54,200
would happen.
Oh,

1306
01:00:54,201 --> 01:00:56,160
these people are so crazy.
Crazy people.

1307
01:00:57,570 --> 01:01:02,150
People that we got running our world are
so fucking hilarious.

1308
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:05,480
When the people that created weapons.
Sure.

1309
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:10,580
The people that decided to like test 
tube and blow shit up and see what you 

1310
01:01:10,580 --> 01:01:10,580
ever.

1311
01:01:10,580 --> 01:01:14,280
You've seen the video of the one nuclear
bomb that they blew up in the ocean 

1312
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:16,760
where there's all these battleships 
around it and the water,

1313
01:01:17,130 --> 01:01:18,480
I'm like,
I dunno,

1314
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:22,220
like half a mile into the sky and it's 
just,

1315
01:01:22,221 --> 01:01:26,870
it's so ridiculous.
The people exaggerating.

1316
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:28,880
Am I even exaggerating?
I might not be mad.

1317
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:34,070
I'm like,
I wish I was more than 100 feet.

1318
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:37,490
It was ridiculously high in the sky and 
these are battleships,

1319
01:01:37,491 --> 01:01:42,491
dude,
like big ass battleships and this water 

1320
01:01:42,491 --> 01:01:44,130
just flying through the air like 
somebody made that,

1321
01:01:44,340 --> 01:01:49,340
that will have a group of people.
They made that and then they just 

1322
01:01:49,340 --> 01:01:49,460
fucking did it.
They just did it.

1323
01:01:49,490 --> 01:01:54,490
Let's see what it looks like.
That's fucking fascinating that it 

1324
01:01:54,490 --> 01:01:55,270
must've been when it was only 
theoretical when there was all these anc

1325
01:01:55,271 --> 01:01:57,560
had sitting around just ending the these
ideas,

1326
01:01:58,010 --> 01:02:03,010
oppenheimer and Einstein and all these 
motherfuckers with their ideas come 

1327
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:04,190
together and they think it could be done
and they know it could be.

1328
01:02:04,370 --> 01:02:08,390
It's almost like science compels them to
create it.

1329
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:10,670
Well,
science knowing that's the PR.

1330
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:14,370
That's that.
That right there errors.

1331
01:02:14,380 --> 01:02:16,880
The danger,
because things get weird at that point,

1332
01:02:16,881 --> 01:02:18,850
like those fucking signed someone is in 
control,

1333
01:02:18,851 --> 01:02:20,250
but other than the scientists themselves

1334
01:02:20,630 --> 01:02:25,630
and someone always will be and the 
people that will be would never be able 

1335
01:02:25,630 --> 01:02:28,320
to create that in the first place.
They would never be able to come up with

1336
01:02:28,321 --> 01:02:29,370
this intellectually.

1337
01:02:29,490 --> 01:02:34,490
That's why scientists are.
It's a very interesting thing because 

1338
01:02:34,490 --> 01:02:35,400
they have this idea.
They're just seeking knowledge.

1339
01:02:35,401 --> 01:02:36,960
They're Catholics.
No more out.

1340
01:02:36,961 --> 01:02:41,150
That's what they do and then you know,
but the people paying them to do this or

1341
01:02:41,180 --> 01:02:43,110
gender.
It's quite often the military,

1342
01:02:43,290 --> 01:02:47,160
but look at these fucking guys who just 
invented that new bird flu.

1343
01:02:47,161 --> 01:02:52,161
Did you hear about this?
Running it through ferret kidneys or 

1344
01:02:52,161 --> 01:02:52,500
something they created.
I don't remember how they did.

1345
01:02:52,501 --> 01:02:57,501
It was like running it through ferrets.
So they created apparently something 

1346
01:02:57,501 --> 01:02:57,501
that.
What was the,

1347
01:02:57,501 --> 01:03:02,000
what is it?
Thirty percent of the people who got to 

1348
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:02,000
die or kill something insane.
They said it.

1349
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:06,580
It would make smallpox look like the 
common called smallpox is already 

1350
01:03:06,901 --> 01:03:09,990
something that if,
if if there was a smallpox outbreak,

1351
01:03:09,991 --> 01:03:12,090
we'd be fucked.
We beat smallpox.

1352
01:03:12,110 --> 01:03:14,460
Now.
Why are they making fucking super dizzy?

1353
01:03:14,461 --> 01:03:17,490
Because they're just trying to find 
information.

1354
01:03:17,790 --> 01:03:22,320
They're exploring the universe and so 
that's their motivation.

1355
01:03:22,410 --> 01:03:26,670
Yet what they did is they created a 
biological nuclear weapon.

1356
01:03:26,671 --> 01:03:31,671
Now she's all over the fucking planet.
There's people in the military mean when

1357
01:03:31,711 --> 01:03:36,711
someone.
I'm sure that some military commander 

1358
01:03:36,711 --> 01:03:36,711
which is looking through there.
I was like,

1359
01:03:36,711 --> 01:03:39,840
Oh Martha,
can you get data scientists on the line?

1360
01:03:39,841 --> 01:03:41,940
I'd like to talk to them and they're 
like,

1361
01:03:41,941 --> 01:03:45,240
Hey,
do you guys want to make $17,000,000

1362
01:03:45,241 --> 01:03:47,250
this week?
Send over your research.

1363
01:03:47,251 --> 01:03:50,670
We'd like to know how to make this 
biological agent,

1364
01:03:50,671 --> 01:03:53,790
and then the next thing you know,
some fucking government somewhere in the

1365
01:03:53,791 --> 01:03:54,690
world.
I mean,

1366
01:03:54,691 --> 01:03:56,670
Shit.
You think Iran wasn't interested in that

1367
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:58,500
or what?
Maybe North Korea.

1368
01:03:58,750 --> 01:04:03,750
Certainly any,
any fucking world power would want that 

1369
01:04:03,750 --> 01:04:07,551
weapon.
That's a great weapon outside of the 

1370
01:04:07,551 --> 01:04:07,551
fact that it ends up.
We'll see.

1371
01:04:07,551 --> 01:04:07,680
You know,
biological weapons,

1372
01:04:08,130 --> 01:04:09,900
biological weapons have a really.

1373
01:04:10,050 --> 01:04:12,600
The problem with that one is it might 
not burn itself out,

1374
01:04:12,870 --> 01:04:17,870
but biological weapons have a distinct 
advantage over nuclear weapons because 

1375
01:04:17,870 --> 01:04:21,120
nuclear weapons destroy infrastructure,
biological weapons.

1376
01:04:21,121 --> 01:04:26,121
Just kill a lot of logical lens,
so if you have a nice fast moving 

1377
01:04:26,121 --> 01:04:28,200
fucking disease that you've made that 
you can drop on a city,

1378
01:04:28,530 --> 01:04:31,080
then you know,
fly in there three months down the road,

1379
01:04:31,081 --> 01:04:32,760
clean up the bodies,
you've got a city,

1380
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,200
you know.
Fuck.

1381
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:35,270
Yeah.
Yeah.

1382
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:35,960
So it's,
it's,

1383
01:04:35,961 --> 01:04:40,961
it's better than a fucking nuclear 
weapon where now you've got a nuclear 

1384
01:04:40,961 --> 01:04:41,190
wasteland that you can't use for a long 
time.

1385
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:42,630
So isn't it

1386
01:04:42,730 --> 01:04:47,730
strange just comes down to the people 
that are in control of that kind of 

1387
01:04:47,921 --> 01:04:50,770
power?
I almost can't help but be cuts.

1388
01:04:50,980 --> 01:04:55,980
Right?
The only reason why you got to that 

1389
01:04:55,980 --> 01:04:55,980
position in the first place is because 
you're wanting to do this.

1390
01:04:56,860 --> 01:04:57,370
Well,
yeah.

1391
01:04:57,371 --> 01:04:58,200
You ended up.
Yeah.

1392
01:04:58,390 --> 01:05:03,390
If you're,
if you're one of those guys pushing 

1393
01:05:03,390 --> 01:05:03,390
these buttons,
you,

1394
01:05:03,390 --> 01:05:03,390
you,
you,

1395
01:05:03,390 --> 01:05:03,390
you've always wanted to do this.

1396
01:05:03,390 --> 01:05:05,180
Yeah.
And it puts us in a real bind man,

1397
01:05:05,181 --> 01:05:07,820
because it doesn't represent us.
It doesn't represent us,

1398
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,880
represent any of us,
but even if let's say we spread it,

1399
01:05:10,881 --> 01:05:15,881
let's say somehow it spreads through and
all of a sudden like the consciousness 

1400
01:05:15,881 --> 01:05:16,610
of like all these people who started 
getting into power,

1401
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:17,740
they're,
you know,

1402
01:05:17,741 --> 01:05:21,040
people who are like coming,
like people who are coming into power.

1403
01:05:21,041 --> 01:05:26,041
We didn't have more openminded Internet 
ideology of how the world works and 

1404
01:05:26,041 --> 01:05:30,091
let's say that just the whole of our 
government suddenly turns into like the 

1405
01:05:30,091 --> 01:05:31,840
smartest fucking people on.
Forgive me for saying this.

1406
01:05:31,841 --> 01:05:35,950
The smartest people on reddit are now 
running the United States government.

1407
01:05:35,951 --> 01:05:40,951
All of a sudden that's the country would
be perfect.

1408
01:05:41,350 --> 01:05:41,890
Fucking.

1409
01:05:42,020 --> 01:05:43,850
That'd be perfect.
There'd be like,

1410
01:05:43,890 --> 01:05:46,130
no dude.
If the intranet ran the world,

1411
01:05:46,190 --> 01:05:51,190
the world would be beautiful.
There will be incredible wine because 

1412
01:05:51,190 --> 01:05:52,040
the Internet is the voice of the people.
Really the only voice of the people.

1413
01:05:52,041 --> 01:05:53,080
It's the only voice we all

1414
01:05:53,090 --> 01:05:58,090
have there.
The only way they're the breaking news 

1415
01:05:58,090 --> 01:06:00,170
stories of be like cute cat pictures and
sucking it the.

1416
01:06:00,370 --> 01:06:05,370
But here's the problem.
If that happened in this country and 

1417
01:06:05,370 --> 01:06:08,781
let's say happened in Europe and let's 
say it happened and parts of a parts of 

1418
01:06:08,930 --> 01:06:13,930
Asia still these pockets,
all you need is like two or three 

1419
01:06:13,930 --> 01:06:18,221
fucking pockets of people who are 
worshiping some mythological entity that

1420
01:06:18,231 --> 01:06:23,231
they think is a hates gay people and 
wants women to wear a fucking weird shit

1421
01:06:23,961 --> 01:06:26,870
or thinks it's okay to like lash people 
are,

1422
01:06:27,050 --> 01:06:28,520
I think,
I don't remember which country was.

1423
01:06:28,521 --> 01:06:30,910
I think some countries just as executed 
someone for.

1424
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:33,330
I think it might've been Iran,
but that could be propaganda.

1425
01:06:33,331 --> 01:06:34,000
Who knows?
I don't know,

1426
01:06:34,010 --> 01:06:37,310
but apparently someone.
They executed a guy for coming up with a

1427
01:06:37,580 --> 01:06:39,530
program that allows people to download 
porn.

1428
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:45,580
Yes.
Now if you just have a few of these 

1429
01:06:45,580 --> 01:06:45,620
psychopaths out there,
they can ruin the whole fucking party.

1430
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:50,640
Oh my God.
It's like the earth right now has the 

1431
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:53,531
potential to turn into an awesome party,
but you know that thing that happens 

1432
01:06:53,531 --> 01:06:57,251
when two dicks roll into a party,
like two Weirdos that nobody invited or 

1433
01:06:57,251 --> 01:07:01,090
like all of a sudden start fucking 
drinking too much and like trying to 

1434
01:07:01,090 --> 01:07:02,240
pick fights.
That's what we have on a planetary scale

1435
01:07:02,241 --> 01:07:03,540
right now,
but then,

1436
01:07:03,620 --> 01:07:08,620
but the people they're becoming,
it used to be it was mostly psychos at 

1437
01:07:08,620 --> 01:07:11,801
the party.
Now it's getting to be where there's 

1438
01:07:11,801 --> 01:07:13,601
more and more cool people at the party 
and we got to figure out how to get the 

1439
01:07:13,601 --> 01:07:14,920
dicks out of the house.
That's where we're at right now.

1440
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:19,880
Let's get these assholes out here to do 
is we've got to convert the Dicks,

1441
01:07:20,380 --> 01:07:22,300
convert whatever dicks that can be 
converted,

1442
01:07:22,301 --> 01:07:26,440
convert them to be cool human being.
Let them know that to be nice,

1443
01:07:26,441 --> 01:07:31,441
to be able feels good for you too,
and it's the best way to communicate 

1444
01:07:31,441 --> 01:07:31,441
with people.
Be Nice to everybody,

1445
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:33,850
pump your friends up,
help each other out.

1446
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:35,950
Be Cool with each other,
support each other.

1447
01:07:35,980 --> 01:07:36,610
Look,
look,

1448
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:41,640
look out for each other.
Develop a community of people that are 

1449
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:41,650
going to give them all mushrooms.
Don't teach you.

1450
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:47,320
Why not?
Why you calling on my game,

1451
01:07:47,321 --> 01:07:52,321
kid,
there's a thread on mixed martial 

1452
01:07:52,961 --> 01:07:54,550
arts.com.
One of them says,

1453
01:07:54,740 --> 01:07:59,740
why is Joe Rogan so in a mushrooms?
Could you see that thing I tweeted 

1454
01:07:59,740 --> 01:08:03,091
today?
Obviously written by someone who hasn't 

1455
01:08:03,091 --> 01:08:03,091
done mushrooms,
right?

1456
01:08:03,091 --> 01:08:03,370
Or the Das that you've never done 
mushrooms.

1457
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:04,210
Come on silly.

1458
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:05,520
You see that thing I tweeted today?
Uh,

1459
01:08:05,530 --> 01:08:10,530
it's kind of old.
I've known about it for whereby they 

1460
01:08:10,530 --> 01:08:11,500
found evidence to help mushrooms.
Helping depression.

1461
01:08:11,530 --> 01:08:12,550
Yeah.
I did see that.

1462
01:08:12,730 --> 01:08:14,050
Look,
in this day and age,

1463
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:16,700
you know,
what they should be doing with mushrooms

1464
01:08:16,701 --> 01:08:18,650
is studying them.
They should have,

1465
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:21,650
they should be absolutely 
decriminalized.

1466
01:08:21,860 --> 01:08:23,900
They have no one's dying from mushrooms.
Okay?

1467
01:08:23,901 --> 01:08:25,370
What people are doing,
they're freaking out.

1468
01:08:25,670 --> 01:08:29,450
One of the reasons why they're freaking 
out because life is fucking crazy enough

1469
01:08:29,451 --> 01:08:34,451
as it is.
And a lot of times you're holding a 

1470
01:08:34,451 --> 01:08:34,451
billion things in the back of your head 
that you're trying to fight off.

1471
01:08:34,451 --> 01:08:39,410
I don't want to remember.
Or You want to pretend you did a better 

1472
01:08:39,410 --> 01:08:42,791
thing that you really didn't take those 
mushrooms and you're ugly truth.

1473
01:08:43,221 --> 01:08:47,780
They just thrown into your face like,
like diarrhea from the horse,

1474
01:08:47,781 --> 01:08:49,670
just blah all over you.

1475
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:52,010
That's what.
It's just like your reality and that's a

1476
01:08:52,011 --> 01:08:53,450
bad trip.
That's not a bad trip.

1477
01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:54,790
Does it trip?
You needed it there.

1478
01:08:55,070 --> 01:08:56,870
There are no bad trips,
Joe.

1479
01:08:57,050 --> 01:09:00,500
The only difficult trips.
Difficult challenging trips.

1480
01:09:00,590 --> 01:09:02,000
That's the idea.
You've got to remove the.

1481
01:09:02,090 --> 01:09:05,010
I heard that.
That's less.

1482
01:09:05,180 --> 01:09:07,920
You overdose.
What I did was a bad job.

1483
01:09:07,921 --> 01:09:12,050
There's nothing wrong with Brian.
It's sort of like if you've got jet fuel

1484
01:09:12,051 --> 01:09:14,360
and you shoved it into someone's Prius,
they'd be like,

1485
01:09:14,361 --> 01:09:17,210
what the fuck is this in here for?
We're not working.

1486
01:09:17,211 --> 01:09:22,211
Right.
We just don't like I couldn't walk 

1487
01:09:22,211 --> 01:09:22,211
Duncan.
I was following.

1488
01:09:22,211 --> 01:09:22,720
My feet would not work.
We don't have that.

1489
01:09:22,730 --> 01:09:25,040
Then you'd have to be like Shaquille 
O'Neal to handle that,

1490
01:09:26,050 --> 01:09:31,050
but in this super society or talking 
about nine slash 11 for bad trips,

1491
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:35,030
like seven slash 11,
if you're having a bad trip,

1492
01:09:35,031 --> 01:09:39,110
call it and be like,
I'm fucking freaking out.

1493
01:09:39,110 --> 01:09:40,860
I can't feel my feet.
And then they could,

1494
01:09:40,910 --> 01:09:43,940
you know that they could send over some 
fucking cool.

1495
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:46,830
Well the real problem is we,
we're,

1496
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:49,400
we're great when we could communicate 
directly with each other,

1497
01:09:49,401 --> 01:09:53,120
but when we band together in big groups 
and then we can't communicate,

1498
01:09:53,121 --> 01:09:58,121
we get too far away from each other.
Then we just start getting dickie with 

1499
01:09:58,121 --> 01:09:58,530
the people that are the furthest away,
like,

1500
01:09:58,550 --> 01:09:59,480
fuck them,
man.

1501
01:09:59,481 --> 01:10:01,590
I'm taking their shit.
They're owned by where the good water is

1502
01:10:01,910 --> 01:10:05,150
and you know that.
That's where the lack of it,

1503
01:10:05,151 --> 01:10:07,460
that the fact that you don't feel all 
these other people.

1504
01:10:07,970 --> 01:10:10,400
I think it's an evolving entity.
That's what I think.

1505
01:10:10,401 --> 01:10:15,401
I think the human organism is some crazy
technology inventing,

1506
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:19,790
evolving organism.
I think that the invention of technology

1507
01:10:19,791 --> 01:10:22,400
though I think is like the whole reason 
why we're here.

1508
01:10:22,670 --> 01:10:27,670
I think what we're all doing as standup 
comedians and as nurses and doctors and 

1509
01:10:29,330 --> 01:10:32,870
we are all supporting the system that 
keeps alive.

1510
01:10:32,870 --> 01:10:36,140
The people that make the awesome shit.
We're just going to find out that we are

1511
01:10:36,141 --> 01:10:38,030
technology.
That's when you die.

1512
01:10:38,031 --> 01:10:38,960
You're like,
oh,

1513
01:10:38,961 --> 01:10:40,430
I get it.
We're the caterpillar.

1514
01:10:40,431 --> 01:10:45,431
That becomes the butterfly.
We are working towards the invention of 

1515
01:10:45,431 --> 01:10:46,880
this ultimate technology.
We just don't see it that way.

1516
01:10:46,881 --> 01:10:51,881
We think of our lives is I've got to get
my shit together and I've got to get my 

1517
01:10:51,881 --> 01:10:51,881
yoga.
You know,

1518
01:10:51,881 --> 01:10:54,440
when I get to yoga,
I'm there.

1519
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:57,380
I'm home.
I am centered,

1520
01:10:57,381 --> 01:11:02,381
you know,
you're just trying to make up for the 

1521
01:11:02,381 --> 01:11:04,451
fact that you know,
you've got some weird situation where 

1522
01:11:04,451 --> 01:11:04,451
your husband doesn't fuck anymore.
Let's be realistic.

1523
01:11:04,451 --> 01:11:09,430
You're getting all crazy with your 
crystals because you ain't get no good 

1524
01:11:09,430 --> 01:11:09,710
dick with them.
Chris Crazy with your crystals.

1525
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:12,950
But at the end of the day I have a 
feeling that the whole thing might be in

1526
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:14,040
just so we keep

1527
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:19,070
buying cooler shit and this weird 
complex social order that we have is all

1528
01:11:19,171 --> 01:11:22,620
just fucking the ripples and waves of 
reality.

1529
01:11:22,621 --> 01:11:26,560
But the whole thing is pushing towards 
more improved.

1530
01:11:26,740 --> 01:11:27,280
No.
Yeah.

1531
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:32,300
Pushes towards innovation.
Like look at what's happening right now 

1532
01:11:32,300 --> 01:11:34,951
with Sopa and Pipa and what you're 
seeing is a right now technology has 

1533
01:11:35,471 --> 01:11:40,471
surpassed,
has their past government and it's 

1534
01:11:40,471 --> 01:11:44,761
surpassed the control mechanisms that 
are in place in like the entertainment 

1535
01:11:44,761 --> 01:11:48,361
industry to monetize their product.
They have to innovate a new way.

1536
01:11:48,490 --> 01:11:49,040
They have to go

1537
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:51,970
the vote on shit online.
That's what it should be.

1538
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:53,620
It should be.
You log in,

1539
01:11:53,621 --> 01:11:55,590
you have a fucking email address.
You know,

1540
01:11:55,630 --> 01:12:00,630
it's Duncan trussell at the United 
States of America Dot Com and you 

1541
01:12:00,630 --> 01:12:01,840
fucking log in and you get to vote,
period.

1542
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:03,550
That's how it should all be done.
Yeah,

1543
01:12:03,551 --> 01:12:05,560
keep the system secure.
Don't be an asshole.

1544
01:12:05,561 --> 01:12:08,080
Don't abuse it.
Let's find out what people really want

1545
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:10,740
that you know,
that's the future.

1546
01:12:11,570 --> 01:12:12,630
It would be happy

1547
01:12:13,260 --> 01:12:15,960
down.
I know that some dude hacked UFC.com

1548
01:12:15,961 --> 01:12:19,570
this week.
I wanted to find out something

1549
01:12:19,910 --> 01:12:24,910
and one of the upcoming match.
So I don't want you to be motherfucking 

1550
01:12:24,910 --> 01:12:27,600
kidding me.
Some little Weirdo dude made this cool.

1551
01:12:27,780 --> 01:12:30,360
It was actually kind of a cool,
weird picture that you would love.

1552
01:12:30,420 --> 01:12:32,790
It was like a Hitler with a big crazy 
giant eyes.

1553
01:12:32,791 --> 01:12:33,650
Did you see it?
Yeah.

1554
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:36,480
But you know,
it's a redirect.

1555
01:12:36,570 --> 01:12:38,370
Is that A.
is that as just redecorate?

1556
01:12:39,090 --> 01:12:43,680
Why do you like to do a site?
Because it's so Sopa the

1557
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:45,270
UFC supports the,
uh,

1558
01:12:45,330 --> 01:12:45,880
the,
uh,

1559
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:47,580
the online piracy thing.

1560
01:12:47,590 --> 01:12:52,590
Why?
Why did they did they must not 

1561
01:12:52,590 --> 01:12:54,151
understand it that well.
Every media companies doing it because 

1562
01:12:54,151 --> 01:12:54,151
that's what it's for because they're,
they're scared.

1563
01:12:54,151 --> 01:12:54,520
You know what it is,
man,

1564
01:12:54,521 --> 01:12:58,150
it's like you got this fucking problem.
People are afraid of afraid to speak up,

1565
01:12:58,151 --> 01:13:03,151
and a lot of people agreed on this damn 
thing and now the truth is coming out 

1566
01:13:03,151 --> 01:13:04,090
about the way it works and people are 
afraid to speak.

1567
01:13:04,090 --> 01:13:07,450
I don't know enough about it,
but I'm going to see them this weekend.

1568
01:13:07,451 --> 01:13:09,310
I'm going to ask them what it's all 
about.

1569
01:13:09,311 --> 01:13:14,311
I don't understand you,
so I'm sure there'll be able to explain 

1570
01:13:14,311 --> 01:13:14,311
it.

1571
01:13:14,311 --> 01:13:14,790
You see Dana Dane as a tweets during 
when all this was happening.

1572
01:13:14,791 --> 01:13:15,870
He's was like,
I don't give a shit.

1573
01:13:15,990 --> 01:13:16,980
Yeah,
he doesn't give a fuck.

1574
01:13:17,250 --> 01:13:18,060
He's like,
I'm not eating.

1575
01:13:18,540 --> 01:13:19,380
That's what he said.
He goes,

1576
01:13:19,381 --> 01:13:20,790
I'm not Ebay,
lol.

1577
01:13:20,910 --> 01:13:22,290
He goes up and down the website 
business.

1578
01:13:22,291 --> 01:13:27,291
I'm in the flight business.
You could not have the guy running that 

1579
01:13:27,291 --> 01:13:28,100
day.
You cannot have a better guy.

1580
01:13:28,380 --> 01:13:30,810
That guy's a cool Dana White Shit.

1581
01:13:30,870 --> 01:13:31,530
Oh,
he was.

1582
01:13:31,650 --> 01:13:33,750
I Dunno man.
He wants to be high with his employees.

1583
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:37,020
You don't have to smoke.
Yes we do.

1584
01:13:37,050 --> 01:13:38,430
We're going to do a podcast.
No,

1585
01:13:38,490 --> 01:13:39,660
he doesn't.
We don't have to smoke.

1586
01:13:39,661 --> 01:13:40,810
When Danny would do it,
we

1587
01:13:40,870 --> 01:13:44,290
could have them for sure.
We just want to tell him.

1588
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:46,150
I don't know if there's a lot of shit.
He couldn't talk about it.

1589
01:13:46,151 --> 01:13:49,210
Now it's big time.
Big Time with Fox.

1590
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:50,910
Fox,
Fox.

1591
01:13:50,911 --> 01:13:53,620
Fight this weekend and you don't give a 
fuck.

1592
01:13:54,020 --> 01:13:55,580
So I'll just talk about it amongst 
myself.

1593
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:57,190
I'm very excited.
Wait,

1594
01:13:57,230 --> 01:13:58,680
the Oh,
is that you have seen this week?

1595
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,400
I know that.
I see.

1596
01:14:00,510 --> 01:14:03,610
Yeah.
It's a Damien Maia versus this kid Chris

1597
01:14:03,610 --> 01:14:08,610
Weidman.
He's just a bad ass wrestler from New 

1598
01:14:08,610 --> 01:14:08,610
York.
Fucking kids.

1599
01:14:08,610 --> 01:14:12,511
A beast.
He's like one of those up and coming 

1600
01:14:12,511 --> 01:14:12,511
guys strangling,
putting people to sleep,

1601
01:14:12,511 --> 01:14:15,550
taking people down,
smashing like veterans and he's taken on

1602
01:14:15,551 --> 01:14:17,020
that.
Damien Maia Jujitsu wizard.

1603
01:14:17,050 --> 01:14:18,190
That's how bad ass fight.

1604
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:21,080
You know what shocking about the UFC man
that I never.

1605
01:14:21,380 --> 01:14:23,800
You don't see unless you come to like 
alive.

1606
01:14:23,810 --> 01:14:28,810
UFC seeing somebody get choked out up 
close is fucking disturbing,

1607
01:14:30,711 --> 01:14:31,820
man.
It's awesome.

1608
01:14:31,970 --> 01:14:33,560
But man,
when you see that fucking,

1609
01:14:33,900 --> 01:14:36,490
it's like.
It's like watching somebody with like,

1610
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:38,510
I don't know,
the gardening,

1611
01:14:38,511 --> 01:14:40,700
she just.
It just clamps down.

1612
01:14:40,701 --> 01:14:44,270
It's like watching a clamp just smashed 
someone's wind pipe.

1613
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:46,340
It seems like they can't live after 
that.

1614
01:14:46,341 --> 01:14:48,080
It seems like you destroy their neck.

1615
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:49,310
Yeah.
You feel like it,

1616
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:52,010
but no dudes come right back.
Judge,

1617
01:14:52,110 --> 01:14:57,110
you see that USC has the xbox app now 
where you can just watch live UFC on 

1618
01:14:57,720 --> 01:15:00,570
xbox.
You can sit there and pay per view,

1619
01:15:00,571 --> 01:15:02,340
but through xbox.
How much is it?

1620
01:15:02,470 --> 01:15:03,940
The charger?
Xbox,

1621
01:15:03,941 --> 01:15:04,730
is that what?
Yeah,

1622
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:07,310
that's sweet.
They're going to do it and they're doing

1623
01:15:07,311 --> 01:15:09,730
them in movie theaters as well.
They've done it before I moved here.

1624
01:15:09,810 --> 01:15:12,090
That would be fucking cool.
But you know,

1625
01:15:12,220 --> 01:15:15,180
checkouts physiologically,
not that bad for your body.

1626
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:17,100
Head impact is bad.
Yeah.

1627
01:15:17,580 --> 01:15:19,860
Hen impact they're finding out is,
you know,

1628
01:15:20,070 --> 01:15:21,960
you got to limit the amount of times you
get hit.

1629
01:15:21,961 --> 01:15:25,560
That's why for a fighter it's really 
important to know what to hang it up.

1630
01:15:25,590 --> 01:15:28,480
There's a certain amount of shots and 
after that you should really.

1631
01:15:28,481 --> 01:15:29,480
You should.
You know,

1632
01:15:29,730 --> 01:15:32,520
I know you still like to do it,
but you got to think about your feet.

1633
01:15:32,730 --> 01:15:35,420
Who decides this is the.
Does the.

1634
01:15:35,690 --> 01:15:38,660
Is it always in that decision at the 
fighter in the UFC?

1635
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:42,200
Ultimately it has to be the decision of 
the fighter unless someone owns him,

1636
01:15:42,201 --> 01:15:44,660
unless he's a slave.
But as an organization,

1637
01:15:44,690 --> 01:15:46,940
if you kind of know a guy in the 
organization,

1638
01:15:46,941 --> 01:15:49,070
if the UFC decided that someone should 
be fighting for them,

1639
01:15:49,071 --> 01:15:51,650
that doesn't keep them from fighting,
they'll go somewhere else.

1640
01:15:51,651 --> 01:15:53,300
I mean the,
the UFC,

1641
01:15:53,330 --> 01:15:56,300
you know,
does offer advice to guys and they,

1642
01:15:56,301 --> 01:15:56,990
they,
you know,

1643
01:15:57,020 --> 01:15:58,810
they care very much for their fighters.
They have like,

1644
01:15:58,830 --> 01:15:59,780
you know,
like chocolate l,

1645
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:04,800
they gave him a great job and part of 
the reason was they didn't want him to 

1646
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:04,970
fight anymore.
He had this amazing career,

1647
01:16:04,971 --> 01:16:06,110
but when it's over,
it's over.

1648
01:16:06,111 --> 01:16:06,590
And you know,
they,

1649
01:16:06,591 --> 01:16:09,080
they had one last fight.
He lost that.

1650
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:09,710
They said,
all right,

1651
01:16:09,711 --> 01:16:11,030
you're right.
I'm just going to settle in.

1652
01:16:11,031 --> 01:16:16,031
And they got an awesome cushy desk job 
and he travels around and like 

1653
01:16:16,031 --> 01:16:16,031
represents the UFC.

1654
01:16:16,031 --> 01:16:18,980
And the beauty of that is it's like they
took care of them.

1655
01:16:19,010 --> 01:16:20,030
They're like,
they pull them,

1656
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:22,100
you know what I mean?
Like they said,

1657
01:16:22,101 --> 01:16:22,750
look,
this is,

1658
01:16:22,790 --> 01:16:24,050
this is it,
this is time.

1659
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:25,670
Let's,
let's just settle the fuck down.

1660
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:26,780
You know,
let's,

1661
01:16:26,781 --> 01:16:28,580
let's move on to the next stage of life.
You're an author,

1662
01:16:28,620 --> 01:16:31,760
you're a bad motherfucker.
He'll be a bad motherfucker business.

1663
01:16:31,940 --> 01:16:35,090
He'll be a bad motherfucker to anything.
He wants to do a certain point in time,

1664
01:16:35,091 --> 01:16:37,490
you know,
it's good to have somebody cares for you

1665
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:39,560
that comes in and steps in.
And that's what Dana did.

1666
01:16:39,561 --> 01:16:41,000
Dana like totally hooked,
chuck up.

1667
01:16:41,001 --> 01:16:42,770
You know,
chuck was with him from the beginning.

1668
01:16:42,771 --> 01:16:47,771
They were there,
they were together at the beginning and 

1669
01:16:47,771 --> 01:16:47,771
he's taken care of.
Um,

1670
01:16:47,771 --> 01:16:47,771
and it's,
it's awesome.

1671
01:16:47,771 --> 01:16:48,700
It's awesome to see that.
And it's awesome to see a guy who knows,

1672
01:16:48,870 --> 01:16:50,480
you know what,
this is a smart thing to do.

1673
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:53,180
I'm just going to step away because it's
so hard for fighters.

1674
01:16:53,181 --> 01:16:56,240
Man.
That moment of the moment of competition

1675
01:16:56,570 --> 01:16:59,600
is so intense and so extreme and 
victory,

1676
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:04,800
you know,
I've been there while Chuck Liddell won 

1677
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:04,800
like some big,
big fights.

1678
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:08,711
I was like right there during the Hay 
day when he was in his prime man and 

1679
01:17:08,711 --> 01:17:13,391
having been and having seen that,
if you could ever do that ever,

1680
01:17:13,710 --> 01:17:16,370
you could ever do that,
you would want to keep doing it.

1681
01:17:16,580 --> 01:17:19,050
You would just be convinced,
I'm just going to go one more time.

1682
01:17:19,051 --> 01:17:24,051
I'm going to keep doing it.
It's amazing that he could ever stop 

1683
01:17:24,051 --> 01:17:25,550
because it's such a rush for them.
I watched him knock these down.

1684
01:17:25,551 --> 01:17:27,830
I watched him knock Randy coture out 
twice.

1685
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:30,620
She is flatlining guys with these 
punches.

1686
01:17:30,621 --> 01:17:35,621
It was crazy and running around.
He was the scariest fucking guy on the 

1687
01:17:35,621 --> 01:17:36,890
planet for like a few years.

1688
01:17:36,890 --> 01:17:41,890
Man.
He was terrifying when he was just 

1689
01:17:41,890 --> 01:17:42,770
running shit in the UFC when he was in 
his true athletic peak.

1690
01:17:42,950 --> 01:17:45,930
That must have been an amazing feeling.
It must've been.

1691
01:17:45,970 --> 01:17:48,770
That life must have been so crazy and 
exciting.

1692
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:54,100
You're stepping into a cage against the 
most ferocious guys on the planet and 

1693
01:17:54,100 --> 01:17:58,541
you're smashing them,
smashing them in front of the whole 

1694
01:17:58,541 --> 01:17:59,070
world.
You know?

1695
01:17:59,240 --> 01:17:59,730
I mean,
he's.

1696
01:17:59,750 --> 01:18:04,750
His career was incredible man.
Just fucking incredible knockouts.

1697
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:07,580
The Bible,
Lou knockouts,

1698
01:18:07,581 --> 01:18:10,430
but he was just a beast man when he was,
when Chuck Liddell was on,

1699
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:15,520
on top when he was at his best man,
one of the most exciting guys of all 

1700
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:16,760
time.
So for that guy,

1701
01:18:16,970 --> 01:18:17,560
you know,
it's,

1702
01:18:17,570 --> 01:18:19,690
it's probably real hard.
Jesus.

1703
01:18:19,940 --> 01:18:24,940
Just accept giddy up in the morning 
listening to the quiet of your yard as 

1704
01:18:24,940 --> 01:18:29,501
you walk towards your fucking newspaper,
that sitting in your front porch and 

1705
01:18:29,501 --> 01:18:31,280
you're looking out there and just people
are mowing their lawn.

1706
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:33,800
You start shadow box.
You start going.

1707
01:18:33,801 --> 01:18:35,530
Maybe just one more fight.
Alright,

1708
01:18:36,300 --> 01:18:37,960
you get bored?
Yeah,

1709
01:18:37,961 --> 01:18:40,400
back in there.
I want to feel a fucking rush.

1710
01:18:40,730 --> 01:18:42,920
You want to,
you know,

1711
01:18:42,950 --> 01:18:45,080
it's hard for those guys.
It's very hard.

1712
01:18:45,110 --> 01:18:50,110
It's an incredibly difficult transition.
I experienced it in the most minute of 

1713
01:18:50,601 --> 01:18:52,070
levels,
you know,

1714
01:18:52,380 --> 01:18:55,250
just tight window and kickboxing.
But when I,

1715
01:18:55,850 --> 01:18:57,440
when I stopped fighting,
when I was like 20,

1716
01:18:57,770 --> 01:19:00,250
21 or 22 was my last fights,
I,

1717
01:19:00,251 --> 01:19:02,260
I just fucking.
It's,

1718
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:03,590
it's a,
it's a weird thing.

1719
01:19:03,890 --> 01:19:05,740
It's a hard decision to either feeling,
man.

1720
01:19:05,741 --> 01:19:10,741
I,
I get that feeling now that it gets 

1721
01:19:10,741 --> 01:19:12,181
boring.
I get that feeling when I delete 

1722
01:19:12,181 --> 01:19:13,420
starcraft for Michael,
it's you.

1723
01:19:13,710 --> 01:19:18,710
The real problem with me,
when I was a kid doing martial arts is 

1724
01:19:18,710 --> 01:19:19,050
worried about two things.
One,

1725
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:21,470
you couldn't make any money.
There was no money in I kickboxing.

1726
01:19:21,510 --> 01:19:26,510
It's nothing back then does.
She couldn't even kickbox and 

1727
01:19:26,510 --> 01:19:26,510
Massachusetts,
you'd have to drive to Rhode island like

1728
01:19:26,510 --> 01:19:27,660
we couldn't.
It was weird.

1729
01:19:27,661 --> 01:19:30,840
You could fight in full contact.
Taekwondo matches in Massachusetts,

1730
01:19:31,110 --> 01:19:36,110
but you couldn't kick box.
You had to go to Rhode Island for that 

1731
01:19:36,110 --> 01:19:36,110
and they didn't even have more.
Tyler,

1732
01:19:36,110 --> 01:19:36,110
it was just like,
it was a,

1733
01:19:36,110 --> 01:19:38,610
it was a mess.
And then there's the brain damage issue,

1734
01:19:39,380 --> 01:19:41,640
brain damage,
which is always a concern.

1735
01:19:41,670 --> 01:19:44,670
I was always thinking about that because
I knew I was like,

1736
01:19:45,030 --> 01:19:45,780
you know,
um,

1737
01:19:45,781 --> 01:19:50,781
I did not do very well in school,
but because I did not want to pay 

1738
01:19:50,781 --> 01:19:51,300
attention,
I was just really distracted kid.

1739
01:19:51,540 --> 01:19:53,460
I'm sure if I was with the wrong 
parents,

1740
01:19:53,461 --> 01:19:55,350
they would have drugged me.
Especially today.

1741
01:19:55,390 --> 01:19:57,120
Yeah,
it was like super distracted,

1742
01:19:57,140 --> 01:20:00,240
you know,
but I read a lot of Shit and you know,

1743
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:05,300
go being like a young kid and not like 
what the fuck is going on with the world

1744
01:20:11,071 --> 01:20:16,071
and trying to figure things out and 
trying to like read as much as you can 

1745
01:20:16,071 --> 01:20:20,730
to try to piece it together yourself.
This is a very bizarre place to be.

1746
01:20:20,790 --> 01:20:21,270
Yeah.

1747
01:20:23,670 --> 01:20:24,930
A lot of us get there,
right?

1748
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:30,020
A lot of people that we know came from a
place where when they were really young 

1749
01:20:30,510 --> 01:20:35,510
they were like,
what the fuck is going on with the 

1750
01:20:35,510 --> 01:20:37,821
world?
How old do you think you were when you 

1751
01:20:37,821 --> 01:20:37,821
had your first?
Oh,

1752
01:20:37,821 --> 01:20:40,200
I think my parents might be fucking 
crazy thought.

1753
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:42,750
Were you like,
these people are in charge of telling me

1754
01:20:42,751 --> 01:20:44,130
what to do.
This is nonsense.

1755
01:20:44,131 --> 01:20:45,930
You make you,
you're talking crazy talk here.

1756
01:20:45,970 --> 01:20:49,840
It happens.
It happened for me the first time that I

1757
01:20:49,841 --> 01:20:54,370
took a lsd a and maybe before that,
but when I took Lsd,

1758
01:20:54,371 --> 01:20:56,230
I,
when I took lsd for the first time,

1759
01:20:56,231 --> 01:20:59,050
I can remember when,
whenever you take Lsd,

1760
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:01,040
especially,
you know,

1761
01:21:01,130 --> 01:21:01,890
I mean,
you know,

1762
01:21:01,900 --> 01:21:04,090
when I took Lsd,
what worries do I have?

1763
01:21:04,270 --> 01:21:06,160
I'm in fucking high school.
There's no,

1764
01:21:06,161 --> 01:21:07,870
there's nothing in it.
There's nothing to.

1765
01:21:08,020 --> 01:21:13,020
There's no demons to come swimming out 
of my brain and taunt me with like all 

1766
01:21:13,020 --> 01:21:14,320
the myriad of things you get when you're
older.

1767
01:21:14,440 --> 01:21:17,100
There's fucking nothing we just opened.
I'm,

1768
01:21:17,130 --> 01:21:22,130
I might be upset because like I said,
a cheerleader that came over to my 

1769
01:21:22,130 --> 01:21:22,750
house.
I couldn't figure out how to kiss her.

1770
01:21:22,751 --> 01:21:25,930
Maybe that's like the biggest problem 
I'm having at the time.

1771
01:21:25,931 --> 01:21:26,830
So,
but I,

1772
01:21:26,831 --> 01:21:28,900
you know,
at that time when I did it for the first

1773
01:21:28,901 --> 01:21:32,620
time and had that initial experience,
you know,

1774
01:21:32,621 --> 01:21:34,630
when you go back to your parents who've 
never taken it,

1775
01:21:34,750 --> 01:21:37,030
and if you mentioned to them that you'd 
even taken it,

1776
01:21:37,031 --> 01:21:42,031
they might want to put you in a drug 
rehab or they think you're insane or 

1777
01:21:42,031 --> 01:21:42,031
they think you're getting down the wrong
track,

1778
01:21:42,031 --> 01:21:44,650
you're forced into this place of like,
fuck man,

1779
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:46,110
I can't,
I,

1780
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:47,560
you,
you guys don't even,

1781
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:48,960
you don't even know you.

1782
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:53,960
You don't even understand this new way 
of experiencing life.

1783
01:21:54,030 --> 01:21:55,150
You know,
so.

1784
01:21:55,270 --> 01:22:00,270
And I think there's a lot of people who 
spend their whole lives never knowing 

1785
01:22:00,270 --> 01:22:02,140
that you don't have to take psychedelics
to get to that place.

1786
01:22:02,141 --> 01:22:04,630
There's other ways to get to that place.
But yeah,

1787
01:22:04,631 --> 01:22:09,631
it's a very strange thing.
And those people who never get to that 

1788
01:22:09,631 --> 01:22:09,631
place,
they're the ones who are,

1789
01:22:09,670 --> 01:22:11,200
a lot of them are,
are in control.

1790
01:22:11,201 --> 01:22:11,350
Right.

1791
01:22:11,620 --> 01:22:15,820
So your life took an inexorable change 
when you did acid.

1792
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,920
That was the point where you look back 
and you said,

1793
01:22:17,921 --> 01:22:20,320
this is the point where I went off into 
this direction.

1794
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:22,080
Um,
well,

1795
01:22:22,081 --> 01:22:23,250
I know I'd say that the,
the,

1796
01:22:23,460 --> 01:22:28,460
that,
that taking acid started with a series 

1797
01:22:28,460 --> 01:22:30,150
of like books.
It started with contact with like,

1798
01:22:30,570 --> 01:22:32,880
you know,
the whole weirdness.

1799
01:22:32,940 --> 01:22:36,960
My whole weird weirdness started with,
or as I recall,

1800
01:22:36,961 --> 01:22:41,961
it started with me coming upon this book
that my mom had called Raja Yoga by Yogi

1801
01:22:43,470 --> 01:22:45,510
raw mature Rocka,
who by the way,

1802
01:22:45,750 --> 01:22:50,750
it was never a Yogi which just some 
English mistake and lied about being a 

1803
01:22:50,971 --> 01:22:54,330
Yogi,
but is a fascinating story.

1804
01:22:54,450 --> 01:22:56,000
But the book,
you know,

1805
01:22:56,010 --> 01:23:01,010
that was the first time I'd ever read 
the idea that you're there,

1806
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:04,590
that you're an observer observing 
yourself,

1807
01:23:04,591 --> 01:23:07,480
that you,
you aren't necessarily the,

1808
01:23:07,481 --> 01:23:08,320
you,
that you think the,

1809
01:23:08,321 --> 01:23:11,200
you,
that can be observed is not you.

1810
01:23:11,410 --> 01:23:13,510
You're the observer state.
The mindfulness,

1811
01:23:13,511 --> 01:23:18,511
the watch or that's when I,
that's the first time I'd come upon the 

1812
01:23:18,511 --> 01:23:18,511
idea of what's that's called the altman.

1813
01:23:18,511 --> 01:23:19,930
The thing that observes yourself.
You know,

1814
01:23:19,931 --> 01:23:22,600
when you know someone will say,
I'm really mad right now.

1815
01:23:23,130 --> 01:23:26,860
The moment you say I'm mad,
you're creating a distinction,

1816
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:32,100
you know,
between the thing that's observing that 

1817
01:23:32,100 --> 01:23:32,230
you're mad and the thing that's mad,
so that observer,

1818
01:23:32,231 --> 01:23:34,500
that watcher,
that's the thing that,

1819
01:23:34,680 --> 01:23:36,810
that mindfulness is what,
you know,

1820
01:23:36,940 --> 01:23:39,100
throughout my whole life,
I try to,

1821
01:23:39,130 --> 01:23:44,130
you know,
go into that place of observing myself 

1822
01:23:44,130 --> 01:23:47,251
rather than being the thing and it's a 
game that you can play and it really is 

1823
01:23:47,251 --> 01:23:49,510
quite helpful with a variety of,
of problems,

1824
01:23:49,511 --> 01:23:54,310
especially if you get really angry.
If you get really angry and you can stop

1825
01:23:54,311 --> 01:23:58,090
yourself and just watch and there's 
tools you can use in that book.

1826
01:23:58,091 --> 01:24:01,990
I remember it said as you walk around,
start thinking he is walking.

1827
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:07,320
That was one of the tools,
like it's in a book and you're a 

1828
01:24:07,320 --> 01:24:07,320
character in a book.

1829
01:24:07,320 --> 01:24:07,880
So when you're going around you're like,
you know,

1830
01:24:07,900 --> 01:24:10,390
right now he's doing a podcast right 
now.

1831
01:24:10,391 --> 01:24:12,580
He is talking and so that's,
these are,

1832
01:24:12,820 --> 01:24:14,620
these are activities designed to create 
this.

1833
01:24:14,621 --> 01:24:17,800
Like the watcher,
the state of presence of watching.

1834
01:24:17,890 --> 01:24:20,230
So that started it.
That led me to like,

1835
01:24:20,380 --> 01:24:21,390
you know,
I,

1836
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:22,840
and then I found out about,
you know,

1837
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:23,970
I,
I,

1838
01:24:24,150 --> 01:24:26,290
I think I read the electric koolaid acid
test,

1839
01:24:26,590 --> 01:24:31,590
you know,
about fucking Ken Kesey and the merry 

1840
01:24:31,590 --> 01:24:33,710
pranksters blasting themselves on acid 
and going to the world's fair in a bus.

1841
01:24:33,711 --> 01:24:35,920
And then I read that shit.
I remember.

1842
01:24:35,921 --> 01:24:36,980
Wait,
I'll tell you that.

1843
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,860
I'll stop this weird,
weird rant.

1844
01:24:39,220 --> 01:24:42,240
I remember now.
Fucking film strip.

1845
01:24:42,340 --> 01:24:47,340
That's what it started in my head.
I think I was in fourth grade and they 

1846
01:24:47,340 --> 01:24:50,710
showed us a drug film strip.
Remember film strips fucking popped up.

1847
01:24:50,711 --> 01:24:53,560
This guy like it caught.
There's a guy I still remember.

1848
01:24:53,561 --> 01:24:58,561
It's a guy in it.
It's a guy in a fucking empty apartment 

1849
01:24:59,590 --> 01:25:04,590
and he's curled against the law in the 
fetal position and it's an lsd and it 

1850
01:25:04,590 --> 01:25:06,670
looks terrible.
And then the narrator says,

1851
01:25:06,760 --> 01:25:09,610
Lsd can make you experience 
hallucinations.

1852
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:12,430
You can see dragons.
And I remember him saying,

1853
01:25:12,431 --> 01:25:13,720
you could see drag.
And I'm like,

1854
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:19,100
I want to see it.
Sounds awesome.

1855
01:25:20,250 --> 01:25:22,710
Fuck the empty apartment in the fetal 
position.

1856
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:25,950
I'll figure it out.
So that guy's a pussy.

1857
01:25:26,760 --> 01:25:29,080
What are you crying?
So I drag a little bit.

1858
01:25:29,300 --> 01:25:30,160
It's a gas

1859
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:33,050
and that was,
that.

1860
01:25:33,051 --> 01:25:34,430
Put it in my head is like,
well,

1861
01:25:34,431 --> 01:25:34,910
you know,
I,

1862
01:25:34,911 --> 01:25:37,280
I think that that's an interesting thing
to explore,

1863
01:25:37,460 --> 01:25:37,770
but

1864
01:25:41,390 --> 01:25:42,620
yeah,
that's hilarious.

1865
01:25:42,680 --> 01:25:47,680
So you think that you were like to 
Dunkin's like Duncan one and Duncan to 

1866
01:25:47,680 --> 01:25:49,370
like Dunkin one is like regular Dunkin 
growing up,

1867
01:25:49,460 --> 01:25:50,470
innocent boy.
Sure.

1868
01:25:50,690 --> 01:25:52,250
Boom.
Psychedelics.

1869
01:25:52,251 --> 01:25:53,810
And then Duncan to two point.
Oh

1870
01:25:53,860 --> 01:25:54,610
yeah,
yeah.

1871
01:25:54,620 --> 01:25:57,610
There's definitely a dunk into that.
That happened.

1872
01:25:57,611 --> 01:25:58,880
I'd say.
And then that,

1873
01:25:58,881 --> 01:26:02,140
that Duncan to change too man,
because you know as you get older,

1874
01:26:02,260 --> 01:26:05,270
the best thing that there's two great.
The best thing that can happen to you as

1875
01:26:05,271 --> 01:26:07,820
you get knocked off track,
that's the best thing that can happen to

1876
01:26:07,821 --> 01:26:12,821
you in general because generally the 
track you're on has been set for you by 

1877
01:26:12,821 --> 01:26:15,630
people who never got off their track.
You end up,

1878
01:26:15,950 --> 01:26:18,890
you end up the child of someone who 
decided to have you in their twenties,

1879
01:26:19,130 --> 01:26:20,450
21,
22.

1880
01:26:20,570 --> 01:26:22,070
They're not going to know a lot of 
stuff.

1881
01:26:22,071 --> 01:26:25,010
They're not going to understand the 
universe that much unless they were like

1882
01:26:25,220 --> 01:26:29,510
came from a really good family of artist
are intelligent people.

1883
01:26:29,690 --> 01:26:32,150
Chances are they're scared,
hungry,

1884
01:26:32,151 --> 01:26:33,500
desperate,
angry.

1885
01:26:33,650 --> 01:26:35,840
They don't want to be in the 
relationship anymore.

1886
01:26:35,841 --> 01:26:37,550
They don't want to be monogamous 
anymore.

1887
01:26:37,790 --> 01:26:40,970
The idea of non monogamy to them might 
just seem insane.

1888
01:26:41,540 --> 01:26:45,990
Like who the fuck knows,
but you're born into that planet.

1889
01:26:46,020 --> 01:26:48,050
Your.
That's the atmosphere you're born into.

1890
01:26:48,260 --> 01:26:53,260
That's what you're breathing when you're
first born and that can set you on a 

1891
01:26:53,260 --> 01:26:54,230
weird path and that's a very sad path 
that you can get on.

1892
01:26:54,470 --> 01:26:59,470
And so hopefully if you're lucky,
you'll come across somebody who knocks 

1893
01:26:59,470 --> 01:26:59,740
you off that fucking path.
You know?

1894
01:26:59,750 --> 01:27:01,490
I remember the guy who hooked me up with
acid.

1895
01:27:01,670 --> 01:27:04,610
I remember sitting in the theater of my 
school because I was taking.

1896
01:27:04,611 --> 01:27:08,340
I was at drama nerd and I sitting in the
theater of my school next to this guy,

1897
01:27:08,610 --> 01:27:11,330
so the two next to this guy,
Brad,

1898
01:27:11,660 --> 01:27:16,660
and I remember seeing an eye and we're 
talking and he mentioned tripping on Lsd

1899
01:27:18,100 --> 01:27:19,520
and I'm like,
what is like,

1900
01:27:19,620 --> 01:27:21,020
oh yeah,
I took acid over the weekend.

1901
01:27:21,021 --> 01:27:22,030
I'm like,
well,

1902
01:27:22,550 --> 01:27:24,650
why?
You can get acid

1903
01:27:27,070 --> 01:27:31,210
the life,
the life of somebody must animate this.

1904
01:27:31,720 --> 01:27:32,850
Somebody the police.

1905
01:27:32,860 --> 01:27:35,380
I know your folks out there that animate
shit.

1906
01:27:35,830 --> 01:27:37,540
You got to animate this.
That,

1907
01:27:37,690 --> 01:27:42,010
that moment took me to.
And this is really weird.

1908
01:27:42,011 --> 01:27:45,160
Tell me what the first trip was like.
I love to.

1909
01:27:45,430 --> 01:27:48,080
The first trip was,
uh,

1910
01:27:48,081 --> 01:27:51,040
it was white blotter,
a white blotter paper.

1911
01:27:51,041 --> 01:27:52,750
I don't,
it was just white blotter,

1912
01:27:53,010 --> 01:27:55,780
a little p for somehow if you don't know
this,

1913
01:27:56,150 --> 01:28:01,150
uh,
lsd gets put on sheets that looked like 

1914
01:28:01,150 --> 01:28:01,690
blotter paper and sometimes they have 
designed,

1915
01:28:01,691 --> 01:28:06,691
sometimes they don't,
but the name is always a reference to 

1916
01:28:06,691 --> 01:28:07,360
usually as a reference to the design on 
the sheet.

1917
01:28:07,361 --> 01:28:08,020
So,
uh,

1918
01:28:08,220 --> 01:28:09,610
you know,
purple,

1919
01:28:09,611 --> 01:28:11,980
Jesus,
White Blotter of lips,

1920
01:28:11,981 --> 01:28:16,981
you know,
there's a million different names for 

1921
01:28:16,981 --> 01:28:16,981
the different types of acid,
but,

1922
01:28:16,981 --> 01:28:17,650
so this is just white unit is what it 
was,

1923
01:28:17,651 --> 01:28:22,651
but it was really good and I can 
remember I took it and you have to,

1924
01:28:23,711 --> 01:28:28,711
you know,
it takes 30 to 45 minutes sometimes 

1925
01:28:28,711 --> 01:28:28,711
longer for it to kick in.

1926
01:28:28,711 --> 01:28:31,710
I still remember I was sitting in my 
friend's trailer in a trailer park in 

1927
01:28:31,710 --> 01:28:34,740
North Carolina sitting in an empty 
bathtub,

1928
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:38,950
like when it like an empty Jacuzzi tub 
that was in this trailer and I'm sitting

1929
01:28:38,951 --> 01:28:43,210
there and they're watching star wars and
I'm sitting in this bathtub and all of a

1930
01:28:43,211 --> 01:28:48,211
sudden the greatest,
it's the greatest feeling just started 

1931
01:28:48,211 --> 01:28:52,270
going through my legs and up into my 
body and it was a fucking sword fight.

1932
01:28:52,360 --> 01:28:56,050
It was a light Saber fight when I'm 
listening to that.

1933
01:28:56,051 --> 01:28:58,450
But all of a sudden now the sounds 
echoey,

1934
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:00,610
like someone's turned an echo up on it.
So I was like,

1935
01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:04,230
man,
well my parents kind of bouncing around.

1936
01:29:04,470 --> 01:29:07,140
It's beautiful and I feel so fucking 
good.

1937
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:09,540
Started laughing.
It seems so funny.

1938
01:29:09,690 --> 01:29:11,670
Then I went outside and lay in the 
grass.

1939
01:29:11,671 --> 01:29:15,660
I'm staring at the sky.
Everything's beautiful trails.

1940
01:29:15,661 --> 01:29:20,661
You put your hand in front of your face 
and it's just this rainbow of hands 

1941
01:29:20,661 --> 01:29:21,360
drifting in front of your face.

1942
01:29:21,690 --> 01:29:24,960
Everything's breathing.
Then my friends come running out because

1943
01:29:24,961 --> 01:29:28,200
they knew this is the first time I was 
tripping and they all start jumping over

1944
01:29:28,201 --> 01:29:33,201
me.
They're like jumping over me as I'm 

1945
01:29:33,201 --> 01:29:33,990
laying there and they're laughing and 
we're all fucking laughing and it's just

1946
01:29:34,050 --> 01:29:39,050
perfect.
Then I remember they pulled their cock 

1947
01:29:39,050 --> 01:29:40,380
out.
That's when they pulled that.

1948
01:29:40,540 --> 01:29:45,540
Y'all started talking.
We fucked and fucked and then a dog came

1949
01:29:45,571 --> 01:29:48,780
by and we grabbed the dog and started 
fucking the dog.

1950
01:29:49,030 --> 01:29:49,950
No,
no,

1951
01:29:50,240 --> 01:29:51,390
no.
It was beautiful.

1952
01:29:51,710 --> 01:29:53,670
Spirit of acid is very now.
Yeah.

1953
01:29:53,671 --> 01:29:57,000
There was no fucking happening.
There was a lot of like laughing.

1954
01:29:57,510 --> 01:30:02,510
I remember going into my friend Shitty 
high school car in like sitting in,

1955
01:30:02,761 --> 01:30:07,761
like pulling the seat back and looking 
at the ceiling and I'm looking at the 

1956
01:30:07,761 --> 01:30:11,940
ceiling and it's fucking hieroglyphics 
or some kind of like ancient writing,

1957
01:30:11,941 --> 01:30:16,941
you know?
I don't even think I knew what Sanskrit 

1958
01:30:16,941 --> 01:30:16,941
was at the time,
but I probably be like,

1959
01:30:16,941 --> 01:30:16,941
oh,
I'm seeing Sanskrit.

1960
01:30:16,941 --> 01:30:21,350
Some kind of runes are glyphs all over 
my friend's car that she's kind of 

1961
01:30:21,350 --> 01:30:24,780
breathing and warping and it's just 
beautiful.

1962
01:30:24,930 --> 01:30:26,430
So yeah,
that was the,

1963
01:30:26,490 --> 01:30:29,550
that was the first time.
And once you've had that experience,

1964
01:30:30,060 --> 01:30:33,630
how do you go back to a world?
A normal kind of world?

1965
01:30:33,690 --> 01:30:35,270
First time I ever did acid.
I've,

1966
01:30:35,330 --> 01:30:37,380
I've told you this before.
I met Kurt cobain.

1967
01:30:37,530 --> 01:30:38,430
How crazy was that?

1968
01:30:38,470 --> 01:30:39,880
Whoa.
Wow.

1969
01:30:40,190 --> 01:30:40,520
The story

1970
01:30:40,520 --> 01:30:43,910
again.
I think I died this night by the way.

1971
01:30:43,911 --> 01:30:48,911
I have just been very that no,
that this is what made me think of a 

1972
01:30:48,911 --> 01:30:49,820
theory that like every time you die you 
don't know that you die,

1973
01:30:49,821 --> 01:30:53,670
but then you left this road and everyone
else in this other parallel road,

1974
01:30:53,690 --> 01:30:54,920
you know,
they think you die.

1975
01:30:54,921 --> 01:30:59,180
Like you know the funeral.
And this is where I thought this was the

1976
01:30:59,181 --> 01:31:01,220
first time I did ask that me and my 
girlfriend at the time,

1977
01:31:01,221 --> 01:31:03,530
that was Marissa.
We went to go see.

1978
01:31:05,310 --> 01:31:09,100
We went to go see nirvana and she had an
acid and I,

1979
01:31:09,101 --> 01:31:10,400
I've never done acid before.
She goes,

1980
01:31:10,401 --> 01:31:14,570
let's do acid and cedar vinyl.
So we took acid and the opening band was

1981
01:31:14,571 --> 01:31:19,571
on which,
which is some Asian band that just 

1982
01:31:19,571 --> 01:31:19,571
screamed the whole time and it was like,
you know,

1983
01:31:19,571 --> 01:31:20,630
it's kind of like annoying.

1984
01:31:21,180 --> 01:31:26,180
So I was sitting next to the side of the
stage and Kurt cobain comes around the 

1985
01:31:26,180 --> 01:31:29,891
corner and just comes out and it was 
really dark so no one could see it and 

1986
01:31:29,891 --> 01:31:29,960
he's just standing right next to me.
I look over,

1987
01:31:29,961 --> 01:31:31,190
I'm like,
oh my fucking God,

1988
01:31:31,191 --> 01:31:32,780
it's Kurt cobain.
And I was like,

1989
01:31:32,781 --> 01:31:33,380
Hey,
what's up?

1990
01:31:33,381 --> 01:31:33,920
And he goes,
hey,

1991
01:31:34,380 --> 01:31:37,190
you weren't cheeto.
And he held out his bag and I'm like,

1992
01:31:37,191 --> 01:31:42,191
yeah.
And so I held on the cheeto and then 

1993
01:31:42,191 --> 01:31:42,191
suddenly he just like,
somebody goes,

1994
01:31:42,191 --> 01:31:45,821
oh Kurt.
And then he just like throws all the 

1995
01:31:45,821 --> 01:31:45,821
cheetos out in the crowd and then it 
returns back backstage.

1996
01:31:45,821 --> 01:31:48,110
I'm holding this cheeto and I'm like 
through the cheetos and the crowd,

1997
01:31:48,410 --> 01:31:49,930
get a bag of cheetos that he was eating 
for him.

1998
01:31:49,940 --> 01:31:52,790
He just threw it at the crowd.
He just threw cheetos everywhere.

1999
01:31:52,810 --> 01:31:55,730
I mean it was.
This is like a mosh pit in Dayton,

2000
01:31:55,731 --> 01:31:58,250
Ohio side of the stage,
like a rock club,

2001
01:31:58,251 --> 01:31:59,500
you know,
Harry arena,

2002
01:31:59,501 --> 01:32:00,030
I think it was

2003
01:32:00,030 --> 01:32:02,590
a fucking video of Dana white getting in
a mosh pit.

2004
01:32:04,350 --> 01:32:09,350
Yeah.
He went into a rage rage against the 

2005
01:32:09,350 --> 01:32:09,350
machine concert.
Motherfucker got into mosh pit.

2006
01:32:09,350 --> 01:32:12,020
She got security guards looking out for 
him and he jumped to the mosque.

2007
01:32:14,890 --> 01:32:17,270
So I took this cheeto and I put it in my
pocket.

2008
01:32:17,271 --> 01:32:19,230
Like I'm like,
I'm going to save this Cheeto,

2009
01:32:19,231 --> 01:32:24,231
you know?
And then I start tripping really hard 

2010
01:32:24,231 --> 01:32:24,720
and had an amazing concert on the way 
home.

2011
01:32:24,721 --> 01:32:29,721
We're driving and we go by in like,
I'm driving it and this is a 

2012
01:32:29,721 --> 01:32:29,721
thunderstorm of rain.
I'm still tripping,

2013
01:32:29,730 --> 01:32:34,730
tripping,
tripping on acid as responsible 

2014
01:32:34,730 --> 01:32:34,770
citizens.
And then this is even better.

2015
01:32:34,771 --> 01:32:36,480
And I swear to God that you could ask 
her.

2016
01:32:36,481 --> 01:32:41,481
I'm not gonna say who she is on here,
but we started fucking while I was 

2017
01:32:41,481 --> 01:32:44,500
driving in the rain storm on asset for 
my first time fucking.

2018
01:32:44,850 --> 01:32:46,470
And that's where I think I died the 
first time,

2019
01:32:46,500 --> 01:32:50,130
one of the first times I died.
It might be you guys

2020
01:32:50,530 --> 01:32:55,530
this.
Isn't that a theory that you said to me 

2021
01:32:55,530 --> 01:32:55,530
once?

2022
01:32:55,530 --> 01:32:55,930
Yeah.
It's the idea that when you die,

2023
01:32:55,960 --> 01:32:56,350
I think.
Yeah,

2024
01:32:56,351 --> 01:32:57,610
you're the one.
You've said that before.

2025
01:32:57,640 --> 01:32:58,490
Yeah.
Yeah.

2026
01:32:58,540 --> 01:32:59,670
It's just that.
It's like a car.

2027
01:32:59,680 --> 01:33:02,080
It's a multiverse idea.
The idea is you're a fucking.

2028
01:33:02,390 --> 01:33:04,180
You know what?
Your eternal being,

2029
01:33:04,240 --> 01:33:06,460
you are an eternal being.
Your body is a frequent.

2030
01:33:06,490 --> 01:33:09,380
It's like a radio.
That's the tunes you in.

2031
01:33:09,550 --> 01:33:14,140
Tune into your specific personality in 
and the moment you die,

2032
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:16,930
that radio frequency pops into something
else.

2033
01:33:17,670 --> 01:33:19,810
So there's no death.
There's no you're not.

2034
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:22,610
It's not like you die and there's 
nothing there.

2035
01:33:22,611 --> 01:33:27,611
Empty emptiness.
And it's not like you die and you're 

2036
01:33:27,611 --> 01:33:27,611
born as a baby and get to start over 
again.

2037
01:33:27,611 --> 01:33:31,441
It's like something happens.
You're driving down the street and 

2038
01:33:31,441 --> 01:33:31,441
you're like,
man,

2039
01:33:31,441 --> 01:33:34,741
why is that guy in my?
And then all of a sudden you open your 

2040
01:33:34,741 --> 01:33:35,920
eyes and you're going to work,
going to work.

2041
01:33:35,921 --> 01:33:37,030
And like man,
as a weird dream.

2042
01:33:37,120 --> 01:33:40,660
And then you start that life again,
it goes on forever like that,

2043
01:33:40,990 --> 01:33:45,990
that the horrible idea,
especially horrible to bring it up to 

2044
01:33:45,990 --> 01:33:49,471
anybody who's had poor fortune in this 
life is to somehow or another connected 

2045
01:33:49,471 --> 01:33:50,440
with past lives.
You know,

2046
01:33:50,441 --> 01:33:51,850
when you've ever heard someone say that 
like,

2047
01:33:51,880 --> 01:33:56,880
Oh,
you must have been a real fuck head in 

2048
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:56,880
his past life.
And it's like,

2049
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:56,880
wow,
like,

2050
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:57,820
what are you real?
Are you sure?

2051
01:33:58,730 --> 01:34:02,110
You sure could it just not be a roll of 
the dice?

2052
01:34:02,200 --> 01:34:05,320
And maybe part of your Karma is 
recognizing that.

2053
01:34:05,570 --> 01:34:06,380
I think that,
yeah,

2054
01:34:06,381 --> 01:34:07,810
that's why I like the uh,
you know,

2055
01:34:07,950 --> 01:34:12,620
a Buddha,
Buddha said,

2056
01:34:12,621 --> 01:34:14,960
don't,
don't think about the afterlife so much.

2057
01:34:14,961 --> 01:34:17,420
I think even Christ said,
I am the god of the living,

2058
01:34:17,421 --> 01:34:20,950
not the god of the dead.
The idea being that with a voice,

2059
01:34:22,790 --> 01:34:27,790
it's a good.
I think real spiritual masters always 

2060
01:34:27,790 --> 01:34:29,240
tend to try to bring people back into 
the present moment because it's like,

2061
01:34:29,570 --> 01:34:31,370
you know what?
The president has everything.

2062
01:34:31,490 --> 01:34:35,480
I know when Shit goes wrong in my life,
I know why it went wrong.

2063
01:34:35,481 --> 01:34:40,250
I don't have to go back to when I was a 
fryer in the 18 hundreds and like fisted

2064
01:34:40,251 --> 01:34:42,080
a fucking,
you know none.

2065
01:34:42,320 --> 01:34:44,210
I know that if shit's going wrong right 
now,

2066
01:34:44,211 --> 01:34:46,940
generally it's like because I'm fucking 
up now.

2067
01:34:47,230 --> 01:34:50,900
It's good for and people can get lost.
People can start blaming their,

2068
01:34:51,190 --> 01:34:54,120
their Karma or where they're at right 
now.

2069
01:34:54,130 --> 01:34:59,130
I'm past lives and it puts him in this 
place of stupid hopelessness and they 

2070
01:34:59,130 --> 01:35:00,590
don't do the things they need to do 
right now to get to a better place.

2071
01:35:00,620 --> 01:35:05,620
Praise Jesus.
Praise the Lord because I hear so many 

2072
01:35:05,620 --> 01:35:06,050
fucking say his name.
So many simple things you could do,

2073
01:35:06,051 --> 01:35:06,980
man.
All you at.

2074
01:35:07,010 --> 01:35:08,840
Here's what you have to do.
This is my new theory.

2075
01:35:09,650 --> 01:35:14,650
Identify the vampire in your life.
Find the vampire,

2076
01:35:15,290 --> 01:35:20,290
identify the parasite.
It doesn't have to be that you have 

2077
01:35:20,290 --> 01:35:20,290
parasites in life.
It is possible.

2078
01:35:20,290 --> 01:35:23,320
You could have gotten lucky and there's 
no parasites and you get off groovy.

2079
01:35:23,420 --> 01:35:23,870
Sure.
No,

2080
01:35:23,871 --> 01:35:26,960
I'm not saying everyone's got one,
but if you got one,

2081
01:35:26,990 --> 01:35:31,310
if you're walking around with those 
fucking vampire blues,

2082
01:35:31,460 --> 01:35:35,570
you've got the fucking heavy heart and 
you can't feel happy and you feel bad.

2083
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:41,000
There may be an action that you need to 
take that you're afraid to take.

2084
01:35:41,690 --> 01:35:45,020
That's the vampire and you've got to 
fucking not even a person.

2085
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:47,660
Oh No,
I mean it's a situation.

2086
01:35:48,300 --> 01:35:53,300
A vampire in your life.
Find a life sucking situation that 

2087
01:35:53,300 --> 01:35:57,431
you're afraid to kill,
and the reason I say vampires because 

2088
01:35:57,431 --> 01:36:00,610
vampire is only go where they're invited
and generally the situation that you're 

2089
01:36:00,610 --> 01:36:01,100
in,
you invited it in,

2090
01:36:01,220 --> 01:36:05,330
you invited this thing into your life 
and now it's sucking your life energy in

2091
01:36:05,331 --> 01:36:09,360
your blood and your happiness away.
Don't it needs.

2092
01:36:09,560 --> 01:36:14,560
A lot of times you'll try to believe 
you'll try to convince yourself that 

2093
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:15,800
this thing is not a vampire,
but in your heart,

2094
01:36:15,801 --> 01:36:20,801
you know you're a servant to a fucking 
bloodsucker urn felt this thing is like 

2095
01:36:21,171 --> 01:36:25,610
sucking your life as it's away.
Sometimes it's doing it with a trade.

2096
01:36:26,090 --> 01:36:28,460
Quite often there'll be a bad trade.
You'll be,

2097
01:36:28,461 --> 01:36:33,461
you know,
whatever the situation you're in and 

2098
01:36:33,461 --> 01:36:33,461
you'll,
you'll,

2099
01:36:33,461 --> 01:36:35,611
you'll,
you'll feel like you're in this 

2100
01:36:35,611 --> 01:36:35,611
situation.

2101
01:36:35,611 --> 01:36:35,611
You know,
it's worth it.

2102
01:36:35,611 --> 01:36:35,611
It's kind of bad,
but it's totally worth it.

2103
01:36:35,611 --> 01:36:37,760
This happens with jobs quite often,
you know,

2104
01:36:37,761 --> 01:36:38,300
or you're like,
well,

2105
01:36:38,301 --> 01:36:40,220
you know,
but that's good enough.

2106
01:36:41,060 --> 01:36:45,770
That's the vampire you gotta take a 
fucking stake and drive it into.

2107
01:36:45,771 --> 01:36:47,090
It's hard to.
How do you kill a vampire?

2108
01:36:47,091 --> 01:36:48,830
Two ways.
Direct Action.

2109
01:36:49,010 --> 01:36:51,440
You don't kill a vampire by like making 
up with a vampire.

2110
01:36:51,441 --> 01:36:54,680
You don't kill a vampire by like having 
a sit down and talk with a vampire.

2111
01:36:54,920 --> 01:36:57,500
You're not going to be able to like,
you know,

2112
01:36:57,890 --> 01:37:00,230
make friends with the vampire.
There's two ways to kill a vampire.

2113
01:37:00,231 --> 01:37:04,160
One,
you fucking put a stake in its heart.

2114
01:37:04,161 --> 01:37:06,200
The other one is light,
sunlight,

2115
01:37:06,410 --> 01:37:08,030
truth,
light.

2116
01:37:08,210 --> 01:37:10,010
That is the greatest metaphor of all 
time.

2117
01:37:10,250 --> 01:37:14,120
You shine the light of truth onto the 
situation,

2118
01:37:14,360 --> 01:37:18,020
fearlessly analyze it and then you'll 
destroy it.

2119
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:19,760
You know,
because if you really allow yourself,

2120
01:37:19,761 --> 01:37:24,761
if you could act,
you gotta add the real problem with 

2121
01:37:24,761 --> 01:37:24,761
people is not recognizing the enemy.

2122
01:37:24,761 --> 01:37:26,780
It's acting on that enemy.
That's the real problem,

2123
01:37:26,920 --> 01:37:30,680
and that enemy being personal,
your personal demons,

2124
01:37:30,681 --> 01:37:33,950
your your personal jihad.
That's a personal issue.

2125
01:37:34,010 --> 01:37:36,580
You got to fight the beast and it's in 
the end.

2126
01:37:36,920 --> 01:37:38,520
You know what I mean?
It's like everybody's beast.

2127
01:37:38,570 --> 01:37:40,550
Different.
Chapter two of the Bhagavad Gita,

2128
01:37:40,730 --> 01:37:42,530
Arginine,
dejection.

2129
01:37:42,700 --> 01:37:44,960
Arginine has drawn between these two 
forces.

2130
01:37:45,020 --> 01:37:49,190
He does not want to fight.
He drops his bow and God says to him,

2131
01:37:49,550 --> 01:37:52,100
you've got to rise to the fight.
Fight.

2132
01:37:52,130 --> 01:37:54,410
You're a warrior.
This is what you're here for.

2133
01:37:54,590 --> 01:37:56,010
Fight,
fight.

2134
01:37:56,011 --> 01:37:57,720
It's,
it's better to die.

2135
01:37:57,960 --> 01:37:59,900
It's better to die in a righteous 
battle.

2136
01:37:59,910 --> 01:38:02,730
Then goes skulking off into the fucking 
woods and be a beggar.

2137
01:38:02,850 --> 01:38:06,750
It's better to fucking do what you do on
your award or you got to fucking do it.

2138
01:38:06,751 --> 01:38:08,250
Man.
It fucking sucks.

2139
01:38:08,490 --> 01:38:13,490
When you're drunk and you want to throw 
up and you try to not make yourself 

2140
01:38:13,490 --> 01:38:14,790
throw up,
just throw up.

2141
01:38:14,970 --> 01:38:19,970
You'll feel better.
You'll feel better in the end when 

2142
01:38:19,970 --> 01:38:22,491
you're puking,
it's gonna suck because you're helpless 

2143
01:38:22,491 --> 01:38:22,491
and you can't breathe.
Go through it,

2144
01:38:22,491 --> 01:38:26,001
man.
Fucking jab a fucking knife into the 

2145
01:38:26,001 --> 01:38:26,001
foot.
Not Literally of course,

2146
01:38:26,001 --> 01:38:30,140
but yeah,
you got to act and you got to make the 

2147
01:38:30,140 --> 01:38:30,140
big fucking decisions sometimes and it's
scary.

2148
01:38:30,140 --> 01:38:31,800
If it wasn't scary,
it wouldn't be worth anything.

2149
01:38:32,100 --> 01:38:37,100
Yeah.
For some people it's almost like they 

2150
01:38:37,100 --> 01:38:39,231
don't know how to start.
They know that there's action that they 

2151
01:38:39,231 --> 01:38:42,951
need to take in their life,
but they're paralyzed trying to think 

2152
01:38:42,951 --> 01:38:45,501
about it,
trying to figure out how to start and 

2153
01:38:45,501 --> 01:38:45,501
they can never gather up the courage to 
get away.

2154
01:38:45,501 --> 01:38:47,730
It's like a lot of people stay in 
abusive relationships.

2155
01:38:47,731 --> 01:38:49,140
They don't.
They don't have the courage to lead

2156
01:38:49,220 --> 01:38:52,270
exactly because it's scary and it and it
and it seems like it,

2157
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:54,260
you know,
there's so many things that people will,

2158
01:38:54,261 --> 01:38:56,240
like,
ideas people will create.

2159
01:38:56,241 --> 01:38:58,240
They'll keep you trapped and whatever.
Prison,

2160
01:38:58,280 --> 01:39:01,610
urine.
It's very similar to and not.

2161
01:39:01,611 --> 01:39:05,420
I mean what you're talking about in the 
UFC with these fucking fighters,

2162
01:39:05,630 --> 01:39:09,170
this is a visual representation of what 
anyone can do in their life,

2163
01:39:09,171 --> 01:39:11,210
but you're not getting.
Maybe not all of us are going to get,

2164
01:39:11,240 --> 01:39:16,240
obviously be world class fighters,
the inner ring in front of the entire 

2165
01:39:16,240 --> 01:39:19,961
planet and fucking knock someone out,
but you have in your life right now,

2166
01:39:20,931 --> 01:39:22,400
if you haven't already done this,
there is.

2167
01:39:22,430 --> 01:39:27,430
You have the chance to be heroic.
You have the ability right now to make a

2168
01:39:27,561 --> 01:39:29,870
heroic act.
They could kill you.

2169
01:39:30,290 --> 01:39:31,820
That's the thing.
These actions,

2170
01:39:31,821 --> 01:39:34,130
it's not always guaranteed that because 
you do the right thing,

2171
01:39:34,310 --> 01:39:36,230
you're going to end up in a great place.

2172
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:38,600
You might end up fucked.
You might end up,

2173
01:39:38,630 --> 01:39:42,710
you might end up temporarily in a 
homeless or you might end up temporarily

2174
01:39:42,890 --> 01:39:45,810
jobless.
If there wasn't risk associated with it,

2175
01:39:46,360 --> 01:39:48,410
you would have already done it.
That's the point.

2176
01:39:48,710 --> 01:39:53,710
You know,
if there wasn't a risk associated with 

2177
01:39:53,710 --> 01:39:53,710
it wouldn't be worth anything.
You know,

2178
01:39:53,710 --> 01:39:56,780
if Mount fucking Himalaya is we're,
you know,

2179
01:39:57,140 --> 01:39:59,750
a little green grass covered hill and 
apart,

2180
01:40:00,260 --> 01:40:02,390
nobody takes pictures of them at the 
top.

2181
01:40:02,391 --> 01:40:05,720
Putting a flag into what is the danger.
Makes it heroic,

2182
01:40:06,020 --> 01:40:08,300
you know?
So sometimes you just have to fucking.

2183
01:40:08,520 --> 01:40:10,550
I sound like Tony Robbins.
Take the leap.

2184
01:40:10,730 --> 01:40:12,440
Kill the vampire in your life.

2185
01:40:12,580 --> 01:40:14,410
Kill the vampire.
You'll have is a brilliant speech.

2186
01:40:14,411 --> 01:40:15,090
Dude.
You're,

2187
01:40:15,140 --> 01:40:15,940
you're dead,
right?

2188
01:40:16,300 --> 01:40:21,300
I thought I stopped it because I'm like,
not everybody has a bad person in your 

2189
01:40:21,300 --> 01:40:21,300
life,
but I didn't know that.

2190
01:40:21,300 --> 01:40:23,110
That's where your main,
that's you're absolutely dead.

2191
01:40:23,111 --> 01:40:24,130
Right.
You know,

2192
01:40:24,131 --> 01:40:24,810
I,
I,

2193
01:40:24,811 --> 01:40:29,811
I always say that you know,
the energy vampires that you have in 

2194
01:40:29,811 --> 01:40:31,210
your life,
are you really your number one enemy?

2195
01:40:31,520 --> 01:40:33,640
They keep you from enjoying good times.
You know,

2196
01:40:33,641 --> 01:40:33,980
there's,
there's,

2197
01:40:34,150 --> 01:40:36,270
everybody knows I one person will,
you settle down.

2198
01:40:36,300 --> 01:40:37,390
You're like,
oh,

2199
01:40:37,540 --> 01:40:42,540
finally I can fucking relax.
And you turn on the television and then 

2200
01:40:42,540 --> 01:40:45,370
someone for whatever fucking reason will
decide that they have to talk to you now

2201
01:40:45,610 --> 01:40:47,740
and they want to get angry at you.
Now you know,

2202
01:40:47,770 --> 01:40:50,080
it could be a guy or girl,
whoever the fuck it is,

2203
01:40:50,081 --> 01:40:55,081
it's one person that wants to,
they want to have power over you or 

2204
01:40:55,081 --> 01:40:55,900
another and they want to stop you from 
doing what you want to do.

2205
01:40:56,170 --> 01:41:01,170
Like there are people that have issues 
in relationships because one of the 

2206
01:41:01,170 --> 01:41:04,171
persons and then one of the people in 
the relationship has some sort of a 

2207
01:41:04,171 --> 01:41:07,411
transparent issue with the other person 
and what they try to do is they try to 

2208
01:41:07,411 --> 01:41:08,620
control that person from doing things 
that they want to do.

2209
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:13,800
Anytime the guy wants to go play,
play a basketball or something like 

2210
01:41:13,800 --> 01:41:18,331
that,
they come up with a reason why now is 

2211
01:41:18,331 --> 01:41:18,331
the time I would really like you to take
me shopping.

2212
01:41:18,331 --> 01:41:21,961
Or now it's time.
It's almost like they want to see if 

2213
01:41:21,961 --> 01:41:22,720
they can drag you away from the thing 
that you like to do,

2214
01:41:22,721 --> 01:41:26,320
thus proving that they're the most 
important thing in your life.

2215
01:41:26,710 --> 01:41:28,870
And you know what man,
that's fucking sad.

2216
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:29,710
Well,
you know what it is.

2217
01:41:29,711 --> 01:41:34,711
It's instincts.
This is how girls behave if you don't 

2218
01:41:34,711 --> 01:41:34,840
keep the pimp hand strong and that's a 
fact.

2219
01:41:34,930 --> 01:41:39,930
That's a fact.
The only reason why girls get away with 

2220
01:41:39,930 --> 01:41:40,060
stuff like that is because guys let them
get away with it.

2221
01:41:40,210 --> 01:41:41,210
Just like,
you know,

2222
01:41:41,280 --> 01:41:44,620
the real issue with guys being douche 
bags to girls of course,

2223
01:41:44,621 --> 01:41:46,990
is the physical violence issue.
It's not fair.

2224
01:41:47,140 --> 01:41:52,140
It's not fair if you're fucking two 
chicks getting into fight with each 

2225
01:41:52,140 --> 01:41:52,140
other,
you know,

2226
01:41:52,140 --> 01:41:54,100
two lesbians and you basically the same 
size,

2227
01:41:54,310 --> 01:41:54,820
you know,
hey,

2228
01:41:54,821 --> 01:41:56,140
you know,
I don't want you to fight,

2229
01:41:56,200 --> 01:41:58,210
but you know,
I don't know why you're fighting,

2230
01:41:58,211 --> 01:42:01,300
but hopefully you got a good reason.
But it's not a mugging.

2231
01:42:01,330 --> 01:42:06,330
It's not a man beating up a woman.
They're so physical fights are 

2232
01:42:06,330 --> 01:42:06,690
completely out of the question either.
So,

2233
01:42:06,700 --> 01:42:08,740
and then what else is left?
What else is left?

2234
01:42:08,741 --> 01:42:10,930
Trying to explain each other to each 
other,

2235
01:42:10,990 --> 01:42:12,730
you know,
arguing with each other,

2236
01:42:12,940 --> 01:42:17,940
trying to piece it all together would 
not understanding their side at all.

2237
01:42:19,180 --> 01:42:20,080
You know,
we,

2238
01:42:20,081 --> 01:42:21,910
we,
we certainly have to protect people from

2239
01:42:21,911 --> 01:42:23,800
that kind of violence.
Right?

2240
01:42:24,190 --> 01:42:25,150
Yeah.
And that's,

2241
01:42:25,720 --> 01:42:26,380
you know,
that's,

2242
01:42:26,530 --> 01:42:31,240
that's one of the ways that we know that
there's some sort of a,

2243
01:42:31,241 --> 01:42:36,241
a weird disconnect between what we're 
capable of and the way we currently 

2244
01:42:36,241 --> 01:42:39,760
behave like as a human race.
The fact that it's even possible that we

2245
01:42:39,761 --> 01:42:42,070
have a real issue with men beating the 
fuck out of women.

2246
01:42:42,340 --> 01:42:45,550
Like that's a real issue when women who 
get in relationships and get beat up.

2247
01:42:45,850 --> 01:42:48,280
That's terrifying.
That's terrifying.

2248
01:42:48,770 --> 01:42:50,790
That's scary shit.
Yeah,

2249
01:42:51,130 --> 01:42:53,140
it's scary.
It was a girl that I dated when I was in

2250
01:42:53,141 --> 01:42:56,120
high school and she was really crazy and
she was just,

2251
01:42:56,150 --> 01:42:56,860
uh,
just,

2252
01:42:57,150 --> 01:43:00,650
she had like super strict Catholic 
parents and she,

2253
01:43:00,790 --> 01:43:03,370
she was really pretty and she was just 
nuts,

2254
01:43:03,371 --> 01:43:04,900
man.
And we,

2255
01:43:04,901 --> 01:43:07,090
we,
we didn't see each other for years.

2256
01:43:07,210 --> 01:43:11,220
And then one time I was a,
at this might not even been years,

2257
01:43:11,230 --> 01:43:12,760
maybe eight months,
I might be exaggerating,

2258
01:43:12,850 --> 01:43:15,010
but I hadn't seen her in a long time.
When you're 17 years old,

2259
01:43:15,220 --> 01:43:17,320
six months might as well be fucking 
years.

2260
01:43:17,321 --> 01:43:19,010
I mean,
things are accelerating.

2261
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:22,030
Either graduated from high school and,
you know what I mean?

2262
01:43:22,260 --> 01:43:27,260
Um,
and I met her and she was telling me 

2263
01:43:27,260 --> 01:43:27,820
that she had this new boyfriend that hit
her and that she liked.

2264
01:43:27,821 --> 01:43:31,990
It was the craziest conversation.
And I was like,

2265
01:43:31,991 --> 01:43:33,130
whoa.
And first of all,

2266
01:43:33,131 --> 01:43:38,131
I was thinking,
thank God I never hit her because what 

2267
01:43:38,131 --> 01:43:38,131
have I liked it too?
What if you know you,

2268
01:43:38,131 --> 01:43:42,641
you know what if you date a girl and she
would totally start fights and totally 

2269
01:43:42,641 --> 01:43:46,321
do shit to Piss me off.
But I never thought you wanted to get 

2270
01:43:46,321 --> 01:43:46,321
like,
well I never,

2271
01:43:46,321 --> 01:43:46,430
you can't hit a girl.

2272
01:43:46,520 --> 01:43:51,520
Just it's,
it's silly face or hit in the vagina to 

2273
01:43:51,520 --> 01:43:51,950
get smacked.
She'd like to get in the face.

2274
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:54,290
She'd like to get rocked.
Yeah,

2275
01:43:54,291 --> 01:43:59,291
it's crazy.
But she was telling me this 

2276
01:43:59,291 --> 01:43:59,291
understanding.
No,

2277
01:43:59,291 --> 01:43:59,600
she was not rationalizing or you're 
talking about.

2278
01:43:59,601 --> 01:44:01,070
She was being really honest with me.
She was like,

2279
01:44:01,071 --> 01:44:03,350
I'm so confused.
I wasn't a dumb girl.

2280
01:44:03,400 --> 01:44:03,590
No,
no,

2281
01:44:03,600 --> 01:44:04,430
no,
no,

2282
01:44:04,460 --> 01:44:06,110
no.
Talking about a dude.

2283
01:44:06,140 --> 01:44:11,140
Basically just smacking her around and 
fucking her like really rough and beat 

2284
01:44:11,140 --> 01:44:12,170
her up.
Some girls actually like that.

2285
01:44:12,230 --> 01:44:14,630
There's like a weird thing in them.
That one.

2286
01:44:15,080 --> 01:44:17,300
I mean obviously they don't want to get 
injured,

2287
01:44:17,450 --> 01:44:22,450
but they want to get roughed up.
They want to just get hair pulling and 

2288
01:44:22,450 --> 01:44:25,541
smacked him.
And this girl was like into getting 

2289
01:44:25,541 --> 01:44:25,610
smacked.
It was like really crazy to hear.

2290
01:44:25,850 --> 01:44:26,720
I was like,
I didn't know what to say.

2291
01:44:26,720 --> 01:44:28,610
I'm like,
you know what?

2292
01:44:28,611 --> 01:44:29,570
I said to her,
I said,

2293
01:44:29,571 --> 01:44:34,571
listen,
you can only get hit so many times in 

2294
01:44:34,571 --> 01:44:34,571
the hand before you get brain damage.
Okay.

2295
01:44:34,571 --> 01:44:38,261
You really have to consider that.
Sounds like that already have said how 

2296
01:44:38,261 --> 01:44:38,720
this guy's fucking you all the time and 
every time he's fucking you,

2297
01:44:38,730 --> 01:44:41,980
he's hitting you in the head.
I'm like,

2298
01:44:42,330 --> 01:44:44,480
do you have headaches?
I started asking her things.

2299
01:44:44,481 --> 01:44:47,390
I asked fighters get headaches,
sleep at night.

2300
01:44:47,860 --> 01:44:50,650
Like I'm a brain doctor or some shit.
I was like,

2301
01:44:50,660 --> 01:44:52,250
you can't let that do hit you in the 
head.

2302
01:44:52,270 --> 01:44:53,060
Right?
Don't let.

2303
01:44:53,420 --> 01:44:55,340
But if for whatever reason,
like turned her on,

2304
01:44:55,370 --> 01:45:00,370
can you imagine having to tell someone 
you shouldn't let that guy hit you in 

2305
01:45:00,370 --> 01:45:04,391
the hat man,
because you know what's confusing is 

2306
01:45:04,391 --> 01:45:09,341
guys can be like super loving after they
do it because they feel terrible and 

2307
01:45:09,341 --> 01:45:11,640
then they're like really affectionate.
Yeah.

2308
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:14,270
They're really affectionate with.
Some of them aren't even that,

2309
01:45:14,300 --> 01:45:19,300
you know,
but with a lot of people that are the 

2310
01:45:19,300 --> 01:45:21,311
ones that like get drunk and blame it on
getting drunk and that's where they're 

2311
01:45:21,311 --> 01:45:21,311
abusing each other

2312
01:45:21,311 --> 01:45:23,970
world out there and there's a lot of sad
homes in America.

2313
01:45:23,971 --> 01:45:25,740
There's a lot of sad,
sad.

2314
01:45:26,110 --> 01:45:27,790
It's just broken peep,
reality broken,

2315
01:45:27,810 --> 01:45:29,710
people interacting with each other that 
it's broken.

2316
01:45:29,711 --> 01:45:31,960
People interact with each other.
All could be fixed with mushrooms,

2317
01:45:32,950 --> 01:45:37,780
with the Duncan Trussell,
shamonic institute of America to correct

2318
01:45:37,781 --> 01:45:41,050
all of these problems with plants.
That'd be great.

2319
01:45:41,051 --> 01:45:44,350
And the wisdom of the indigenous peoples
of the Amazon rain forest,

2320
01:45:44,380 --> 01:45:47,890
combination of chanting and flashlights.
We will.

2321
01:45:49,920 --> 01:45:54,920
Well,
the fleshlight uses mandatory when 

2322
01:45:54,920 --> 01:45:54,920
you're meditating at my restaurant 
because I don't want anybody horny.

2323
01:45:54,920 --> 01:45:56,800
I don't want like why you're in there 
and you're,

2324
01:45:56,801 --> 01:45:58,780
you know,
you're supposed to be doing your alms.

2325
01:45:58,930 --> 01:46:00,220
You're thinking about getting your dick 
sucked.

2326
01:46:00,390 --> 01:46:01,480
You know what man,
you know,

2327
01:46:01,481 --> 01:46:06,481
like the way,
like what did I read this great 

2328
01:46:06,481 --> 01:46:06,910
autobiography of Timothy Leary and they 
were talking about,

2329
01:46:06,911 --> 01:46:09,190
I can't remember the name of the famous 
house that he lived at,

2330
01:46:09,191 --> 01:46:10,970
but where there were all tripping out 
and like,

2331
01:46:11,110 --> 01:46:14,140
while they're constantly taking lsd,
they would do this.

2332
01:46:14,141 --> 01:46:15,520
They were all swingers.
So there,

2333
01:46:15,550 --> 01:46:20,550
there'd be like guys and girls do and 
what they was banging guys that were 

2334
01:46:20,550 --> 01:46:20,550
right?
Uh,

2335
01:46:20,550 --> 01:46:21,400
I think.
I think so,

2336
01:46:21,401 --> 01:46:22,520
yeah.
I do know fast,

2337
01:46:23,810 --> 01:46:25,030
but I,
I,

2338
01:46:25,340 --> 01:46:28,630
I think Timothy leary's pretty straight.
He was always dating models and shit.

2339
01:46:28,631 --> 01:46:29,620
Like I think,
yeah,

2340
01:46:29,890 --> 01:46:33,040
but that's why America hated him.
A bunch of haters.

2341
01:46:33,310 --> 01:46:38,310
But what they would do is they would 
like have this weird thing because what 

2342
01:46:38,310 --> 01:46:39,800
they were trying to do is they're trying
to dissolve the react there.

2343
01:46:40,430 --> 01:46:45,430
They're trying to dissolve all the 
fucking ego constructs of which one of 

2344
01:46:46,751 --> 01:46:47,690
them is monogamy.

2345
01:46:47,690 --> 01:46:52,690
Monogamy is an ego construct where you 
want to be the only person who is 

2346
01:46:53,010 --> 01:46:58,010
fucking the person that you're with and 
you and they want you to be the only 

2347
01:46:58,010 --> 01:46:59,330
person to be fucking them.
This,

2348
01:46:59,520 --> 01:47:03,100
this is basic way that most people enter
into relationships,

2349
01:47:03,170 --> 01:47:07,140
so what these guys would do is they have
married couples and why they would do is

2350
01:47:07,320 --> 01:47:12,320
randomly to people would be picked a man
and a woman to go into this bowling 

2351
01:47:12,320 --> 01:47:16,971
alley that they had and they would stay 
there for like three days straight and 

2352
01:47:16,971 --> 01:47:19,680
just take acid the whole time and they 
would always end up fucking and the.

2353
01:47:19,830 --> 01:47:24,830
So is this idea,
but there was a lot of babies where 

2354
01:47:24,830 --> 01:47:26,951
nobody knew who the father was for sure.
That I'm sure that happened all the 

2355
01:47:26,951 --> 01:47:26,951
time.

2356
01:47:26,951 --> 01:47:31,280
Well that was Mckenna's idea was the,
an orgy hastick mushroom cultures that 

2357
01:47:31,280 --> 01:47:35,601
existed in his really think that's kind 
of a lot of it was his imagination of 

2358
01:47:35,601 --> 01:47:40,011
what could have been possible because it
doesn't seem like you really explain 

2359
01:47:40,011 --> 01:47:40,340
exactly what these people were doing,
you know,

2360
01:47:40,450 --> 01:47:42,150
10,000
years ago and chuck a towel.

2361
01:47:42,151 --> 01:47:44,930
He yoke and all these different places.
But he had this idea that this,

2362
01:47:45,210 --> 01:47:50,210
the.
They developed this sort of a orgiastic 

2363
01:47:50,210 --> 01:47:51,150
mushroom style of,
of living.

2364
01:47:51,180 --> 01:47:53,010
And then people would get together and 
they would just come,

2365
01:47:53,030 --> 01:47:54,690
you know,
so they would raise each others kids,

2366
01:47:54,900 --> 01:47:58,500
they would all have it all be loving 
each other at all,

2367
01:47:58,890 --> 01:48:00,150
taking care of each other's kids.
I'm like,

2368
01:48:00,151 --> 01:48:01,440
wow,
that's kind of trippy.

2369
01:48:01,800 --> 01:48:04,230
You know,
it makes me think like,

2370
01:48:04,290 --> 01:48:06,220
could you live in a world like that?
I mean if it,

2371
01:48:06,350 --> 01:48:11,190
if that we all are just automatically 
possessive of our loved ones,

2372
01:48:11,191 --> 01:48:12,560
our sexual partners.
You know,

2373
01:48:12,570 --> 01:48:15,090
your wives,
boyfriends and husbands was terrible.

2374
01:48:15,330 --> 01:48:17,220
Yeah.
Well yeah it does.

2375
01:48:17,221 --> 01:48:21,090
But it also feels great when you have 
each other to count on and you have this

2376
01:48:21,091 --> 01:48:23,280
really cool relationship.
Know each other.

2377
01:48:23,740 --> 01:48:25,960
Right?
But the idea that someone like,

2378
01:48:26,130 --> 01:48:27,870
like you're connected,
like you,

2379
01:48:27,910 --> 01:48:32,910
like you,
you're not even allowed to touch and 

2380
01:48:32,910 --> 01:48:32,910
other body like everyone else is like,
get away,

2381
01:48:32,910 --> 01:48:32,910
get away,
get away,

2382
01:48:32,910 --> 01:48:33,240
get away.
You're connected,

2383
01:48:33,241 --> 01:48:35,160
you're connected to the one you're 
connected to.

2384
01:48:35,161 --> 01:48:35,880
The one thing

2385
01:48:36,180 --> 01:48:36,810
fields,
man,

2386
01:48:36,811 --> 01:48:38,330
that's it.
That's strange.

2387
01:48:38,360 --> 01:48:40,170
That feeling,
that inspires.

2388
01:48:40,171 --> 01:48:43,020
That is not a loving feeling.
It's a fucking.

2389
01:48:43,450 --> 01:48:44,320
No,
no.

2390
01:48:44,321 --> 01:48:47,380
It's because men and women have 
completely different wiring.

2391
01:48:47,381 --> 01:48:49,450
And for a lot of women and not all of 
them,

2392
01:48:49,451 --> 01:48:51,910
some women just want dick all around 
every corner,

2393
01:48:52,210 --> 01:48:54,100
some women.
And that's their prerogative man.

2394
01:48:54,101 --> 01:48:56,650
If you're young and hot and you want 
Dick around every corner,

2395
01:48:56,730 --> 01:48:57,670
you should be able to get it.
Like,

2396
01:48:58,060 --> 01:49:00,160
what does that bad when it's only good 
when you fucker.

2397
01:49:00,190 --> 01:49:01,120
You know what I mean?
People are.

2398
01:49:01,150 --> 01:49:06,150
People are God damn crazy.
There really are like there's a fucking 

2399
01:49:06,150 --> 01:49:06,150
whore.
If she was fucking you,

2400
01:49:06,150 --> 01:49:06,760
you'd be like,
Oh God.

2401
01:49:06,761 --> 01:49:09,670
So lucky dude.
We had one smile and she goes,

2402
01:49:09,671 --> 01:49:10,680
you want to come up to my room?
Oh,

2403
01:49:10,690 --> 01:49:11,640
showed us,
you know,

2404
01:49:11,680 --> 01:49:14,560
like how come when you score?
It's awesome.

2405
01:49:15,340 --> 01:49:17,560
And when she scores with other dudes,
she's a fucking.

2406
01:49:17,640 --> 01:49:19,150
Well,
I'll tell,

2407
01:49:19,151 --> 01:49:19,560
I'll tell you

2408
01:49:19,580 --> 01:49:24,580
why.
The reason that is is because our 

2409
01:49:24,580 --> 01:49:25,490
descendants were fucking sexually 
repressed psychopaths and we still have.

2410
01:49:25,520 --> 01:49:26,880
We still have that in us.
And I know there's,

2411
01:49:27,130 --> 01:49:32,130
that's a little of that.
But it's also that we know that girls 

2412
01:49:32,130 --> 01:49:32,130
that are freaks like that.
It's a rare thing.

2413
01:49:32,130 --> 01:49:35,701
It's a weird thing.
It's like probably a weird combative 

2414
01:49:35,701 --> 01:49:35,701
thing.

2415
01:49:35,701 --> 01:49:37,430
Women are getting a really shitty 
position where they got to feel bad.

2416
01:49:37,520 --> 01:49:39,740
If you have a few guys,
and that's not fair,

2417
01:49:39,741 --> 01:49:41,540
and I,
and I know some of it's genetic,

2418
01:49:41,660 --> 01:49:42,260
but I know

2419
01:49:42,580 --> 01:49:44,260
well,
every relationship gets stale.

2420
01:49:44,261 --> 01:49:49,261
Taking out the idea of the genetic why 
people want men want to reproduce with 

2421
01:49:49,261 --> 01:49:52,030
as many women as possible.
Even if you didn't have that,

2422
01:49:52,090 --> 01:49:57,090
that instinctive nature.
There's still the idea that being with 

2423
01:49:57,090 --> 01:49:57,090
one person will just get stale.

2424
01:49:57,090 --> 01:50:00,700
Imagine this somehow from your mind is 
removed.

2425
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:04,780
All the negative or weird or strange 
connotations about sex.

2426
01:50:05,090 --> 01:50:09,460
Sex is just the physical experience of 
close of oneness with another person,

2427
01:50:09,461 --> 01:50:14,461
so there's no.
Nothing from the ice has been putting 

2428
01:50:14,461 --> 01:50:17,730
your head.
Now imagine eating mushrooms and all of 

2429
01:50:17,730 --> 01:50:21,691
a sudden being in the experience of 
having sex with a group of people with 

2430
01:50:22,240 --> 01:50:26,650
zero sexual inhibitions,
with zero guilt,

2431
01:50:26,830 --> 01:50:31,830
just pure,
hedonistic pleasure as you sort of 

2432
01:50:31,830 --> 01:50:32,100
missed.
I can be honest

2433
01:50:32,830 --> 01:50:37,830
with in terms of like a Utopian society,
but the way our world runs.

2434
01:50:38,700 --> 01:50:41,310
It's like my thoughts on it.
I have always been,

2435
01:50:41,311 --> 01:50:46,311
and my advice has always been that when 
you find someone who you really enjoy 

2436
01:50:47,791 --> 01:50:52,140
hanging out with,
hang out with them and whatever,

2437
01:50:52,920 --> 01:50:56,820
if you get to a point where you really 
trust them and you're really honest with

2438
01:50:56,821 --> 01:50:59,210
each other and you're really enjoying 
each other's,

2439
01:50:59,340 --> 01:51:04,340
find out what bothers that person.
What is it was zero genetic thing that 

2440
01:51:04,340 --> 01:51:04,410
you have maybe that I don't have.
What is it?

2441
01:51:04,770 --> 01:51:05,170
You know?
Yeah,

2442
01:51:05,171 --> 01:51:06,360
yeah,
I don't like me in,

2443
01:51:07,060 --> 01:51:12,060
and if you can do that,
if you could find someone you really 

2444
01:51:12,060 --> 01:51:12,060
sync up with and you actually enhance 
each other,

2445
01:51:12,090 --> 01:51:13,760
then it relationships are fucking 
beautiful.

2446
01:51:14,110 --> 01:51:19,110
The real problem is most people did not 
even in the exploring their own 

2447
01:51:19,110 --> 01:51:20,490
consciousness,
they're not into exploring their own,

2448
01:51:20,610 --> 01:51:25,610
the origin of their own thoughts,
that they're not really into self 

2449
01:51:25,610 --> 01:51:28,581
examination.
They're not really into a lot of 

2450
01:51:28,581 --> 01:51:30,060
different things that lead to sometimes 
problematic conversations that you have,

2451
01:51:30,150 --> 01:51:35,150
especially when they have a commodity 
and the commodity is that there an 

2452
01:51:35,150 --> 01:51:39,141
attractive woman and you're in some sort
of a weird situation where there's a 

2453
01:51:39,141 --> 01:51:39,300
master,
there's a master over you.

2454
01:51:39,640 --> 01:51:41,030
Penta,
and it also depends on the,

2455
01:51:41,050 --> 01:51:46,050
the way you get into the thing.
I mean if you look at the entry 

2456
01:51:46,050 --> 01:51:47,650
mechanism into these things,
quite often it's purely based on

2457
01:51:47,940 --> 01:51:48,780
scality.
Yeah,

2458
01:51:49,260 --> 01:51:54,260
that's the problem is that the drug of 
sex and it's really exciting and 

2459
01:51:54,791 --> 01:51:59,791
thrilling to get to the.
I love you part as quick as possible so 

2460
01:51:59,791 --> 01:52:02,260
the sex can get really intense,
you know?

2461
01:52:02,290 --> 01:52:07,290
And that is one of the things that 
happens when you really love someone 

2462
01:52:07,290 --> 01:52:07,290
like you.
You could fuck someone that you think is

2463
01:52:07,290 --> 01:52:08,440
hot and it's like a sexual thing and 
it's,

2464
01:52:08,441 --> 01:52:09,190
you know,
it's really,

2465
01:52:09,570 --> 01:52:12,760
it's a real big turn on,
but it's not like fucking someone that's

2466
01:52:12,761 --> 01:52:13,720
hot that you love.

2467
01:52:14,350 --> 01:52:19,350
So yeah,
and that first awesome time when you're 

2468
01:52:19,350 --> 01:52:19,350
just getting into a relationship where 
the person says,

2469
01:52:19,350 --> 01:52:22,090
I think I'm falling in love with you and
you've been feeling that.

2470
01:52:22,570 --> 01:52:24,780
Holy Shit Man.
Fireworks.

2471
01:52:24,830 --> 01:52:27,560
It's great.
How

2472
01:52:27,660 --> 01:52:32,100
about for some people they'll look for 
an artificial that you know,

2473
01:52:32,101 --> 01:52:34,760
like you can if you get lucky and you 
actually do have that.

2474
01:52:34,761 --> 01:52:36,020
Wow,
that's so lucky.

2475
01:52:36,021 --> 01:52:41,021
You the stars have to align.
So many people get in situations where 

2476
01:52:41,021 --> 01:52:42,380
the person they're with is just a little
off man,

2477
01:52:42,381 --> 01:52:45,070
this whatever it is,
just a little off ever.

2478
01:52:45,230 --> 01:52:46,370
The video that awful.

2479
01:52:46,400 --> 01:52:51,400
What I consider to be the most grotesque
experiment of all time where the 

2480
01:52:51,400 --> 01:52:52,040
fucking.
They took a monkey,

2481
01:52:52,041 --> 01:52:55,890
a little baby monkey and they gave him a
wire or did either.

2482
01:52:55,910 --> 01:52:58,280
I don't even want to talk about this 
disturbs me so much.

2483
01:52:59,230 --> 01:53:02,780
They're covered a fucking like a little 
box with for.

2484
01:53:02,870 --> 01:53:03,920
Yeah,
and the fucking things.

2485
01:53:03,921 --> 01:53:05,480
Cleaning to it.
Oh See,

2486
01:53:05,481 --> 01:53:06,860
now here's the thing.
It's crazy.

2487
01:53:06,861 --> 01:53:11,861
Some people you see that some people 
that a lot of people are in that 

2488
01:53:11,861 --> 01:53:16,811
relationship where they're cleaning to 
something that's not even real and they 

2489
01:53:16,811 --> 01:53:20,261
don't even under.
They've like trick themselves into 

2490
01:53:20,261 --> 01:53:20,261
thinking that

2491
01:53:20,261 --> 01:53:20,261
the real issue is the route.
The other person,

2492
01:53:20,261 --> 01:53:22,050
the issue is that people that are 
raising these people,

2493
01:53:22,051 --> 01:53:24,060
the real issue is how do you.
You know,

2494
01:53:24,061 --> 01:53:27,810
everyone starts out neutral with w,
whatever blend of personality.

2495
01:53:28,470 --> 01:53:33,470
I bet almost every kid,
unless they have some serious 

2496
01:53:33,470 --> 01:53:36,381
neurological difficulties on almost 
every kid can be rendered a positive 

2497
01:53:36,381 --> 01:53:37,920
human being by the right people.
They're surrounded by the right people.

2498
01:53:37,921 --> 01:53:40,050
It's like we're.
What we're doing is by putting,

2499
01:53:40,260 --> 01:53:43,680
we're putting the most important thing 
for the resources of the human race,

2500
01:53:43,860 --> 01:53:48,860
the youthful people developing into 
contributing members of society who can 

2501
01:53:48,860 --> 01:53:51,570
actually add to the culture,
add to the experience,

2502
01:53:51,571 --> 01:53:54,870
add to the process,
and we're putting the development of our

2503
01:53:54,871 --> 01:53:59,730
most valuable resource in the hands of 
everyone and anyone including retards,

2504
01:53:59,910 --> 01:54:01,440
morons,
assholes,

2505
01:54:01,441 --> 01:54:02,920
douchebags,
fuckheads,

2506
01:54:02,940 --> 01:54:07,940
everyone in between.
There's a bunch of crazy motherfuckers 

2507
01:54:07,940 --> 01:54:11,421
shit out kids every day and you can't.
You can't say anything about it because 

2508
01:54:11,421 --> 01:54:12,530
then you're Hitler and then you're,
you know,

2509
01:54:12,570 --> 01:54:13,100
you're,
you're,

2510
01:54:13,170 --> 01:54:14,370
you.
Are you a fan of eugenics?

2511
01:54:14,371 --> 01:54:15,630
Do you know how they didn't work in the 
past?

2512
01:54:15,940 --> 01:54:20,940
The guess what else isn't working?
This overpopulation by monkeys isn't 

2513
01:54:20,940 --> 01:54:20,940
working

2514
01:54:20,950 --> 01:54:22,530
well.
That's why you gotta be a bit of A.

2515
01:54:22,570 --> 01:54:24,350
I mean if you start waking up to

2516
01:54:24,470 --> 01:54:29,470
yeah,
we got to wake all these people up and 

2517
01:54:29,470 --> 01:54:31,060
figuring out a way to re evaluate or 
reevaluate will reset people's minds to 

2518
01:54:31,071 --> 01:54:36,071
reset people's what?
Whatever it is that your operating 

2519
01:54:36,071 --> 01:54:36,071
system is.
How,

2520
01:54:36,071 --> 01:54:36,210
what,
where,

2521
01:54:36,211 --> 01:54:37,190
where,
where it's failing.

2522
01:54:37,350 --> 01:54:37,700
Well,
you,

2523
01:54:37,701 --> 01:54:39,030
you have to like,
you know,

2524
01:54:39,031 --> 01:54:44,031
sometimes you get these really fucking 
flattering tweets from people who listen

2525
01:54:44,791 --> 01:54:45,330
as I'm like,
man,

2526
01:54:45,331 --> 01:54:48,960
I wish I had friends like you guys in my
hometown to talk to you.

2527
01:54:49,170 --> 01:54:51,510
And that's really a super sweet thing to
say,

2528
01:54:51,690 --> 01:54:53,910
but I always think to myself,
you know what?

2529
01:54:54,090 --> 01:54:56,310
Why don't you go,
why don't you go make some?

2530
01:54:56,670 --> 01:54:58,650
Why don't you use fucking tar turned 
into it?

2531
01:54:58,651 --> 01:55:00,740
I know it's hard,
but I want to get out of the highest.

2532
01:55:00,950 --> 01:55:02,670
I don't mean just small town.
I mean,

2533
01:55:02,730 --> 01:55:05,820
I don't mean go make some in the sense 
of light a wicker.

2534
01:55:05,880 --> 01:55:06,720
I don't mean.
No.

2535
01:55:06,721 --> 01:55:10,510
I mean no like baskets.
Now that we're not,

2536
01:55:10,530 --> 01:55:13,370
we know wicked.
Why don't you go?

2537
01:55:13,500 --> 01:55:14,970
Why don't you go,
we've a friend.

2538
01:55:15,240 --> 01:55:20,240
No,
I'm saying what you do is you got to be 

2539
01:55:20,240 --> 01:55:22,671
there.
You got to be the force that maybe like 

2540
01:55:22,671 --> 01:55:22,671
throw somebody off their track,
you know,

2541
01:55:22,671 --> 01:55:24,390
you might have to be the thing that does
that because my,

2542
01:55:24,450 --> 01:55:28,800
like the people I owe the most to are 
the people who manage to fucking knocked

2543
01:55:28,801 --> 01:55:30,150
me off my track,
you know,

2544
01:55:30,151 --> 01:55:35,151
managed to like fucking bring to me 
music I'd never heard before showed me 

2545
01:55:35,151 --> 01:55:36,480
books I'd never heard before.

2546
01:55:36,630 --> 01:55:41,630
And then all of a sudden that steers you
out of the fucking public sector,

2547
01:55:42,540 --> 01:55:43,410
the fucking,

2548
01:55:43,690 --> 01:55:44,620
well,
that's what you're doing.

2549
01:55:44,680 --> 01:55:49,680
That's what you're doing right now.
What you're doing right now is doing 

2550
01:55:49,680 --> 01:55:50,380
that exact same thing to all these 
hundreds of thousands of people that are

2551
01:55:50,381 --> 01:55:55,381
listening to this.
That's it's the exact same thing you're 

2552
01:55:55,381 --> 01:55:59,311
doing.
What you are saying is always been 

2553
01:55:59,311 --> 01:55:59,670
greatest in your life.
You're,

2554
01:55:59,680 --> 01:56:04,680
you're introducing ideas into people's 
heads that they probably never would 

2555
01:56:04,680 --> 01:56:07,090
have come up with,
might not have come up with today.

2556
01:56:07,500 --> 01:56:08,290
You know,
who knows,

2557
01:56:08,291 --> 01:56:09,820
given the right amount of experience in 
time,

2558
01:56:09,821 --> 01:56:10,960
anybody could probably,
you know,

2559
01:56:10,961 --> 01:56:13,390
that's the idea that thoughts aren't,
you're your own.

2560
01:56:13,420 --> 01:56:15,610
You're just tuning into them like some 
sort of a it.

2561
01:56:15,870 --> 01:56:16,660
That's it.
Well,

2562
01:56:16,661 --> 01:56:21,661
that's the idea is that it?
Because I have struggled with that 

2563
01:56:21,661 --> 01:56:21,661
because I like it.
It sounds beautiful.

2564
01:56:21,661 --> 01:56:24,280
It sounds kind of spooky and crazy,
but it also makes me think,

2565
01:56:24,281 --> 01:56:29,170
I wonder if it's just that the mechanism
for retrieving really good,

2566
01:56:30,580 --> 01:56:33,820
interesting creative ideas that the 
method,

2567
01:56:33,880 --> 01:56:36,940
the mechanism for thinking,
you have to have all your resources,

2568
01:56:37,060 --> 01:56:42,060
all your facilitating resources,
so the ego has to be fucking completely 

2569
01:56:42,060 --> 01:56:44,020
quiet and if the ego is not completely 
quiet,

2570
01:56:44,170 --> 01:56:49,170
the ego is like,
I'm going to get some fucking new 

2571
01:56:49,170 --> 01:56:50,860
clothes so I can look slick and I'm 
thinking about getting news,

2572
01:56:50,861 --> 01:56:51,460
nose ring.

2573
01:56:51,460 --> 01:56:53,260
Those rings are pretty hot.
Chicks are really into that.

2574
01:56:53,620 --> 01:56:57,670
I wonder if my hair would be cool if it 
was blond and you start really tweaking.

2575
01:56:57,671 --> 01:56:59,920
Your ego starts wigging out on your 
shit.

2576
01:56:59,980 --> 01:57:04,980
Maybe I should get myself a new cadillac
chicks dig dead Shit and you start 

2577
01:57:04,980 --> 01:57:07,000
fucking.
I'm tired of being the VP at work.

2578
01:57:07,030 --> 01:57:09,650
I'm going to step it up this year.
Nobody demand the fucking,

2579
01:57:09,670 --> 01:57:10,480
you know,
you start getting

2580
01:57:10,480 --> 01:57:12,340
crazy ego.
We

2581
01:57:13,240 --> 01:57:16,850
it like,
it cuts out all the noise.

2582
01:57:16,890 --> 01:57:18,620
It makes,
creates too much noise.

2583
01:57:18,800 --> 01:57:20,480
And the creative mind,
the,

2584
01:57:20,630 --> 01:57:21,800
the,
the Zen mind,

2585
01:57:21,801 --> 01:57:24,440
the humble mine.
There's none of resources.

2586
01:57:24,441 --> 01:57:25,640
So this is a,
you know,

2587
01:57:25,660 --> 01:57:28,110
you use this,
this tool and this tool is to say,

2588
01:57:28,250 --> 01:57:33,250
oh,
I'll just pretend they're not even my 

2589
01:57:33,250 --> 01:57:33,250
thoughts.
I'm just tuning them into the universe.

2590
01:57:33,250 --> 01:57:37,600
I'm so humble.
So what you're doing is with this 

2591
01:57:37,600 --> 01:57:37,600
philosophy,
like putting it through this filter,

2592
01:57:37,600 --> 01:57:41,180
you've just shut your fucking nasty,
stupid ego up by saying that you're just

2593
01:57:41,590 --> 01:57:42,860
a vessel and you're just tuning in.

2594
01:57:42,980 --> 01:57:43,400
Well,
yeah.

2595
01:57:43,401 --> 01:57:43,670
And,
and,

2596
01:57:43,671 --> 01:57:45,410
and you know what man,
I'm not arguing that.

2597
01:57:45,640 --> 01:57:47,900
It's like either or here's how I look at
it,

2598
01:57:48,700 --> 01:57:53,700
or it's not either or whatever fucking 
vehicle you need to use to get to the 

2599
01:57:53,700 --> 01:57:55,880
point where the things turned off.
Use it.

2600
01:57:55,881 --> 01:58:00,881
If you need to conceptualize it by 
thinking you're connecting with some 

2601
01:58:00,881 --> 01:58:03,440
kind of superintelligent consciousness 
that just wants the planet to be happier

2602
01:58:03,441 --> 01:58:05,010
because he doesn't want the planet to 
dine.

2603
01:58:05,040 --> 01:58:08,000
It's giving its own voice there as many 
people as allow it.

2604
01:58:08,340 --> 01:58:08,700
Whatever

2605
01:58:09,340 --> 01:58:10,900
vehicle would that is.
Any,

2606
01:58:10,901 --> 01:58:14,500
any ideology like that along the.
It's a vehicle for you managing

2607
01:58:15,020 --> 01:58:16,210
it's a vehicle.
You know,

2608
01:58:16,230 --> 01:58:19,880
it's so and so when you get in a fucking
bus to get to point a,

2609
01:58:19,881 --> 01:58:21,920
B or c,
it's not the bus.

2610
01:58:21,921 --> 01:58:24,560
It's the point that you're getting to 
use the vehicle,

2611
01:58:24,680 --> 01:58:29,680
use whatever mechanism you have to use 
to dissolve your ego to the point where 

2612
01:58:29,680 --> 01:58:33,431
you're not going to turn into a fucking 
Dick because the moment you start 

2613
01:58:33,431 --> 01:58:34,190
claiming ownership of or whatever it is,
man,

2614
01:58:34,191 --> 01:58:38,930
like I think the most obvious version of
it is like super attractive.

2615
01:58:38,931 --> 01:58:41,800
People who act like they deserve it,

2616
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:44,020
who act like they've done something for 
it.

2617
01:58:44,180 --> 01:58:46,090
That's unfortunately how ugly that makes
it.

2618
01:58:46,890 --> 01:58:50,110
It makes them like really pretty girl 
say nasty shit.

2619
01:58:50,420 --> 01:58:53,020
You just want to say like,
do you know how fucking lucky you are?

2620
01:58:53,021 --> 01:58:56,530
To be as pretty as you are,
you should be like so happy all the time

2621
01:58:56,700 --> 01:58:59,440
to shit on what another girl looks like.
Oh my God.

2622
01:58:59,820 --> 01:59:03,130
It makes them ugly.
So unfortunately because of all the shit

2623
01:59:03,131 --> 01:59:08,131
you could talk about like when a really 
hot chick shits on a girlfriend not 

2624
01:59:08,131 --> 01:59:09,490
being so pretty like wow,
that's like damn that dude.

2625
01:59:09,520 --> 01:59:10,510
What is more

2626
01:59:10,900 --> 01:59:15,900
deadly and attractive than a super hot 
girl who doesn't care that she's super 

2627
01:59:16,661 --> 01:59:21,661
hot.
It was managed to overcome all the 

2628
01:59:21,661 --> 01:59:23,500
fucking years of being worshiped by 
people and it isn't normal and cool.

2629
01:59:23,930 --> 01:59:25,650
That's a.
that's a hard question,

2630
01:59:25,651 --> 01:59:30,651
but that girl is.
She's not going to be one of nine wives 

2631
01:59:30,651 --> 01:59:30,651
in the cult.
What do you most to fuck?

2632
01:59:30,651 --> 01:59:35,541
It's smart for herself and shit.
My post apocalyptic cultural have their 

2633
01:59:35,541 --> 01:59:36,650
place.
I love that.

2634
01:59:37,120 --> 01:59:42,120
Well,
you know why you can make her the high 

2635
01:59:42,120 --> 01:59:42,120
priestess of,
they call it management,

2636
01:59:42,120 --> 01:59:44,950
but like the way that goes nurse,
you just got to fucking ideas.

2637
01:59:44,960 --> 01:59:47,240
Don't get caught up in like with the 
ideas.

2638
01:59:47,241 --> 01:59:50,270
Continue to advance and always analyze,
observe,

2639
01:59:50,300 --> 01:59:52,880
look at all the people around you.
Look at all the different influences,

2640
01:59:52,881 --> 01:59:54,950
all the different things you can draw 
from online.

2641
01:59:54,980 --> 01:59:57,800
Take what is useful,
analyze yourself,

2642
01:59:58,190 --> 02:00:00,050
you know,
it's a process where we're all a part of

2643
02:00:00,051 --> 02:00:00,740
this process.
We,

2644
02:00:00,750 --> 02:00:02,960
you and I have both seen each other 
evolve.

2645
02:00:02,990 --> 02:00:05,930
We just don't really realize it as much 
because we evolved together,

2646
02:00:06,080 --> 02:00:11,080
but if we went back in time 10 years ago
to when we met and then like when we 

2647
02:00:11,080 --> 02:00:11,080
meet,
we'll use it.

2648
02:00:11,340 --> 02:00:13,910
It was about 10 years ago.
A little over that I think.

2649
02:00:13,911 --> 02:00:14,310
Really?
Yeah.

2650
02:00:14,370 --> 02:00:19,370
It might've been like 2001 or something.
What's it like even before that dude's 

2651
02:00:19,370 --> 02:00:20,910
yeah,
I knew slash know.

2652
02:00:20,970 --> 02:00:21,250
I bet.

2653
02:00:21,690 --> 02:00:26,690
I bet you don't remember this.
I remember the first time that you 

2654
02:00:26,690 --> 02:00:26,690
really.
Yes,

2655
02:00:26,690 --> 02:00:30,081
I was.
This was when I was a cory's assistant 

2656
02:00:30,081 --> 02:00:32,661
at the comedy store and we,
I was sitting next to you in Newark.

2657
02:00:34,020 --> 02:00:39,020
I think you had.
This was right around when you just 

2658
02:00:39,020 --> 02:00:39,020
started smoking weed or you because you 
were more.

2659
02:00:39,020 --> 02:00:43,251
You were kind of a marijuana is starting
to become a marijuana advocate at this 

2660
02:00:43,251 --> 02:00:43,251
time,
but it wasn't.

2661
02:00:43,251 --> 02:00:46,230
This was called my annoying phase now,
but it was really funny.

2662
02:00:46,510 --> 02:00:47,850
Yeah,
it was an annoying thing.

2663
02:00:48,030 --> 02:00:50,490
It was really funny because I was like,
man,

2664
02:00:50,580 --> 02:00:53,760
now I was sitting next to you and I at 
the time I had been.

2665
02:00:53,850 --> 02:00:58,850
I got,
I went through this being a marijuana 

2666
02:00:58,850 --> 02:00:58,850
advocate phase,
like,

2667
02:00:58,850 --> 02:00:58,850
you know,
a few,

2668
02:00:58,850 --> 02:01:03,370
a few years before,
but I remember sitting nice and you're 

2669
02:01:03,370 --> 02:01:03,540
talking about weed and as a joke because
I didn't know you that well.

2670
02:01:03,541 --> 02:01:06,090
You didn't know me and as a dumb joke I 
was like,

2671
02:01:06,091 --> 02:01:11,091
man,
we should be illegal and you shot me 

2672
02:01:11,091 --> 02:01:11,091
this fucking look man.
You are,

2673
02:01:11,091 --> 02:01:11,440
you are allowed to make

2674
02:01:11,710 --> 02:01:15,360
because you thought out,
you put them up on his head.

2675
02:01:15,730 --> 02:01:18,900
He was all Gary Oldman him on,
you know,

2676
02:01:18,920 --> 02:01:19,490
I said it should be

2677
02:01:19,820 --> 02:01:23,310
illegal and you seem so paste.
And then corey like was like,

2678
02:01:23,580 --> 02:01:24,500
shut up,
shut up.

2679
02:01:24,501 --> 02:01:27,680
Don't say anything because we didn't 
know each other and I couldn't seem like

2680
02:01:27,681 --> 02:01:32,681
a real asshole at the time.
But then then I don't remember that at 

2681
02:01:32,681 --> 02:01:32,681
all.
I know.

2682
02:01:32,681 --> 02:01:33,290
I think you'd probably be a little 
paranoid.

2683
02:01:33,291 --> 02:01:35,090
I think he tuned me out.
I probably would.

2684
02:01:35,780 --> 02:01:37,190
I don't think I would like,
like,

2685
02:01:37,240 --> 02:01:39,140
like got angry with you.
Don't get angry.

2686
02:01:39,230 --> 02:01:41,640
Probably didn't seem like the morning 
Dario,

2687
02:01:43,840 --> 02:01:48,840
one of two things.
Either you were trying to make a joke 

2688
02:01:48,840 --> 02:01:48,840
which would be not funny and I wouldn't 
be bored

2689
02:01:48,980 --> 02:01:51,330
or I'd be like,
what an asshole.

2690
02:01:51,550 --> 02:01:56,550
Just saying that it was the former.
Then after that we started talking on 

2691
02:01:56,550 --> 02:01:58,160
the phone and we start having 
conversations like

2692
02:01:58,170 --> 02:02:02,400
this on the phone talking and I used to 
have these fucking 45 minute phone calls

2693
02:02:02,401 --> 02:02:05,520
where a call them up because Dunkin was 
the dude who like you'd say,

2694
02:02:05,521 --> 02:02:08,140
Hey,
I can work Tuesday through Thursday this

2695
02:02:08,140 --> 02:02:08,420
week ago.
Okay,

2696
02:02:08,430 --> 02:02:13,430
cool.
And then we'd know they'd get together 

2697
02:02:13,430 --> 02:02:13,430
and create a schedule you'd called 
Duncan would get your avail.

2698
02:02:13,430 --> 02:02:15,180
So me and Duncan just started talking on
the phone.

2699
02:02:15,181 --> 02:02:17,040
I don't know what started it off.
We'd have these

2700
02:02:17,320 --> 02:02:22,320
crazy ass 45 minute fucking while he's 
working at the comedy store and every 

2701
02:02:22,421 --> 02:02:23,770
now and be like,
oh hold on a second dude.

2702
02:02:23,771 --> 02:02:25,660
Sorry he,
he put me on hold.

2703
02:02:25,850 --> 02:02:27,650
They have to answer some other phone 
call,

2704
02:02:28,570 --> 02:02:32,040
flag in your bed with your little swatch
baked as fuck.

2705
02:02:32,410 --> 02:02:34,510
Duggan was highly job every goddamn day

2706
02:02:34,760 --> 02:02:35,830
there.
Yeah,

2707
02:02:35,831 --> 02:02:40,831
there was.
It was a natural progression for me to 

2708
02:02:40,831 --> 02:02:40,831
stay high on the job doing fear factor 
as well.

2709
02:02:40,831 --> 02:02:44,751
It's like it all went and did like 
everybody was high when they were 

2710
02:02:44,751 --> 02:02:45,590
working and that's how you got through 
work when you started working there,

2711
02:02:45,620 --> 02:02:46,740
you know,
I remember you.

2712
02:02:46,800 --> 02:02:48,740
You went through this little struggle 
where he is,

2713
02:02:48,770 --> 02:02:50,540
you know,
you want it to be a comic,

2714
02:02:50,541 --> 02:02:52,820
but they didn't take you seriously while
you're still working there.

2715
02:02:52,830 --> 02:02:57,830
That's right.
I had to go to the vampire man in.

2716
02:02:59,190 --> 02:03:04,190
Anytime you fucking kill that vampire.
If you survive flowers will rain from 

2717
02:03:05,191 --> 02:03:06,370
heaven.
I bloom.

2718
02:03:07,240 --> 02:03:08,910
You can get better.
Everybody can get better.

2719
02:03:08,911 --> 02:03:10,860
We can all of their assets and move 
forward,

2720
02:03:11,100 --> 02:03:12,630
but you got to be positive.
So fuck.

2721
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:18,000
Don't.
Don't be convinced that you have 

2722
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:19,491
anything figured out.
Whether it's the secret or Buddhism or 

2723
02:03:19,491 --> 02:03:19,491
whatever the fuck it is.
Don't be convinced,

2724
02:03:19,491 --> 02:03:19,610
man.
Don't be given.

2725
02:03:19,860 --> 02:03:24,860
This world.
Might be entirely made up of 

2726
02:03:24,860 --> 02:03:24,960
imagination.
It might be,

2727
02:03:25,290 --> 02:03:28,020
it might be entirely made up of 
imagination.

2728
02:03:28,270 --> 02:03:33,270
The more time moves forward,
the more I wonder if there's a theory 

2729
02:03:33,270 --> 02:03:37,851
and I believe that you were the first 
one who introduced me to this theory as 

2730
02:03:37,851 --> 02:03:38,280
well.
The theory that your life,

2731
02:03:38,490 --> 02:03:43,490
the world that you live in,
is really something that your mind has 

2732
02:03:43,490 --> 02:03:44,520
created in.
As you get older and your body starts to

2733
02:03:44,521 --> 02:03:49,521
slowly deteriorates and progress towards
death in your own particular universe.

2734
02:03:50,761 --> 02:03:55,761
That's when the shit hits the fan and it
all goes down and you've managed to 

2735
02:03:55,761 --> 02:03:59,541
manufacturer this idea inside your mind,
the life of your experiences in actual 

2736
02:03:59,941 --> 02:04:04,941
real life when what it really is is just
a series of events that have been tied 

2737
02:04:05,941 --> 02:04:09,660
together to prepare you for the next 
stage of existence,

2738
02:04:09,690 --> 02:04:09,850
right

2739
02:04:09,940 --> 02:04:13,390
man,
and the more that you can let go of your

2740
02:04:13,391 --> 02:04:18,391
attachments to this particular life and 
become the thing that is in throughout 

2741
02:04:19,481 --> 02:04:23,860
the evolutionary cycle,
then they'll see a traumatic death.

2742
02:04:23,870 --> 02:04:28,870
Could you imagine that really does get 
proved some day that you're and 

2743
02:04:28,870 --> 02:04:28,870
everybody will be like,

2744
02:04:28,870 --> 02:04:31,870
imagination controls your fucking life.
God dammit,

2745
02:04:32,460 --> 02:04:34,140
I could have made a fucking awesome 
life.

2746
02:04:35,020 --> 02:04:37,150
I just fucked up and we wired 
everything.

2747
02:04:37,280 --> 02:04:40,170
All the Shitty luck.
Could you imagine if that was really the

2748
02:04:40,171 --> 02:04:41,580
case?
You believed what the fuck is?

2749
02:04:41,820 --> 02:04:46,820
That would be.
It would be such evil information that 

2750
02:04:46,820 --> 02:04:46,820
people wouldn't even want it to get out,
but then you wouldn't.

2751
02:04:46,820 --> 02:04:48,180
That would be.
That would be a religious issue.

2752
02:04:48,181 --> 02:04:53,181
People might withhold that.
They found out that we are in reality 

2753
02:04:53,181 --> 02:04:54,690
architects of our own world,
our own universe,

2754
02:04:55,180 --> 02:04:57,480
that each one of us is actually that 
thing.

2755
02:04:58,560 --> 02:04:59,220
Well,
I think,

2756
02:04:59,260 --> 02:05:00,860
I think.
I think that if here's a,

2757
02:05:00,930 --> 02:05:03,600
here's a weird idea.
If there were,

2758
02:05:03,601 --> 02:05:08,370
imagine there is a hell and the only way
that you could keep the people on how is

2759
02:05:08,371 --> 02:05:10,290
making sure that they didn't realize 
that,

2760
02:05:10,350 --> 02:05:15,350
you know,
at any second they could turn that hell 

2761
02:05:15,350 --> 02:05:15,350
and the heaven.

2762
02:05:15,350 --> 02:05:18,290
You have to keep them.
You had to keep them like oblivious to 

2763
02:05:18,290 --> 02:05:21,681
this idea.
You had realized that the thing you're 

2764
02:05:21,681 --> 02:05:22,140
talking about,
the things that obscure the light,

2765
02:05:22,141 --> 02:05:24,450
so to speak,
of making people's lives great.

2766
02:05:24,620 --> 02:05:26,850
It's like TV.
It's the media.

2767
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:30,630
Every time you turn the TV on,
it's showing you death and destruction.

2768
02:05:30,810 --> 02:05:35,810
When you turn on the radio,
they're talking about wars and bombs 

2769
02:05:35,810 --> 02:05:35,810
everywhere you will look.
It's darkness,

2770
02:05:35,810 --> 02:05:40,491
darkness in darkness.
It's like people are really trying to 

2771
02:05:40,491 --> 02:05:42,420
keep our consciousness focused on the 
dark instead of on the light,

2772
02:05:42,710 --> 02:05:43,310
you know,
but the.

2773
02:05:43,730 --> 02:05:48,730
But if there was a global movement to 
try to get people's minds to shift from 

2774
02:05:49,891 --> 02:05:54,891
the obsession with death and all the 
forms of negativity that so many people 

2775
02:05:54,891 --> 02:05:59,781
are focused on and to turn their minds 
towards a died towards the beauty and 

2776
02:06:00,901 --> 02:06:05,901
towards friendship,
towards like healthy sex and towards 

2777
02:06:05,901 --> 02:06:06,570
embracing each other.

2778
02:06:06,750 --> 02:06:11,750
Then really we,
this entire planet could transform and 

2779
02:06:11,750 --> 02:06:12,120
to some version of heaven,
I think some something,

2780
02:06:12,390 --> 02:06:14,550
a form of paradise,
you know,

2781
02:06:14,730 --> 02:06:17,520
but there a there ultimately and 
eventually,

2782
02:06:17,521 --> 02:06:19,650
but right now,
how long is it gonna take?

2783
02:06:20,460 --> 02:06:22,980
I think it's going to take it.
It's either going to be going to have to

2784
02:06:22,981 --> 02:06:24,140
happen right?
When it's in it,

2785
02:06:24,150 --> 02:06:26,490
some form of invention,
we either get an invention,

2786
02:06:26,491 --> 02:06:31,491
we get an alien or we get destruction.
It's quote Morrissey.

2787
02:06:32,250 --> 02:06:37,250
If it's not love,
it's the bomb that will bring us 

2788
02:06:37,250 --> 02:06:40,671
together though.
It'd be awesome if you didn't quote 

2789
02:06:40,671 --> 02:06:40,671
Morrisey.
I'm sorry,

2790
02:06:40,671 --> 02:06:41,370
but it's a great man.
He's great.

2791
02:06:41,570 --> 02:06:43,890
I've actually.
What is his real name?

2792
02:06:44,480 --> 02:06:46,140
What is his real name?
Was that his real name?

2793
02:06:47,020 --> 02:06:49,590
Is it just going to ask me that?
I'm like every Golfer on the planet.

2794
02:06:49,591 --> 02:06:54,591
It's going to hate me forever if I can't
answer that right away because names.

2795
02:06:54,910 --> 02:06:57,630
Morrissey will be really cool quote.
If you just said his name,

2796
02:06:57,900 --> 02:07:00,330
not just Morrissey.
Maybe it's Ronald.

2797
02:07:00,360 --> 02:07:01,950
Ronald Morris.
Ronald Morris.

2798
02:07:04,870 --> 02:07:06,320
What?
Gary Morrissey.

2799
02:07:06,630 --> 02:07:07,830
No,
it's more legitimate quote.

2800
02:07:07,870 --> 02:07:10,650
So funny how Morris he would never have 
gotten name like a rapper.

2801
02:07:10,710 --> 02:07:12,810
He never would have gotten famous if on 
his albums.

2802
02:07:12,811 --> 02:07:13,650
That said,
Gary,

2803
02:07:17,870 --> 02:07:19,130
Dude,
have you heard Gary?

2804
02:07:19,840 --> 02:07:21,500
Let's go.
It's kind of a mystic.

2805
02:07:21,530 --> 02:07:23,080
I have a mistake.
His name's Gary.

2806
02:07:23,190 --> 02:07:27,080
Now your mistake has been named 
Charlotte getting me that.

2807
02:07:27,190 --> 02:07:32,070
Steven.
Steven.

2808
02:07:32,071 --> 02:07:33,880
By the way,
Steve,

2809
02:07:33,920 --> 02:07:36,070
I knew someone who knew someone

2810
02:07:36,070 --> 02:07:38,170
who got really into yoga and changed her
name.

2811
02:07:39,100 --> 02:07:40,750
She insisted you call her by her new 
name.

2812
02:07:41,050 --> 02:07:43,030
I think there's a useful logan.
I understand that.

2813
02:07:43,031 --> 02:07:48,031
I think there's a usefulness to the.
I think that there's that reinvention 

2814
02:07:48,031 --> 02:07:48,031
that's a good tool,
man,

2815
02:07:48,031 --> 02:07:49,540
and I understand why people do that 
because if you think about your name and

2816
02:07:49,541 --> 02:07:54,541
where it came from with like we're not 
getting named in the way people used to 

2817
02:07:54,541 --> 02:07:55,930
get named people and people used to get 
named on,

2818
02:07:56,320 --> 02:07:58,270
you know,
based on their actions and stuff.

2819
02:07:58,271 --> 02:08:03,271
They real name would come later.
We get named on what some fucking 22 

2820
02:08:03,271 --> 02:08:08,191
year old dope decided that you're the 
little pink wriggling thing that you 

2821
02:08:08,191 --> 02:08:08,980
are.
It should be called,

2822
02:08:08,981 --> 02:08:13,981
you know,
where my mouth is that what you were 

2823
02:08:13,981 --> 02:08:17,230
named after my name.
I don't know where they.

2824
02:08:17,310 --> 02:08:22,310
I don't know where the name came from,
but I do understand this idea of like 

2825
02:08:22,310 --> 02:08:24,730
rebirth or the idea of like once you get
knocked off track,

2826
02:08:24,910 --> 02:08:29,910
why not go really deep and fucking just 
rename yourself the best cult speech 

2827
02:08:30,910 --> 02:08:32,050
have overheard of my life.

2828
02:08:32,080 --> 02:08:33,910
That's the way to get people to really 
drink the Koolaid.

2829
02:08:34,120 --> 02:08:36,180
Just jump in balls first.
Come on man,

2830
02:08:36,230 --> 02:08:37,430
go for it.
Just get in there.

2831
02:08:37,431 --> 02:08:40,990
So I will take the big jump and change 
your name into a crazy new name.

2832
02:08:41,170 --> 02:08:43,670
Your name is Duncan Bitch.
If I was joey did.

2833
02:08:43,700 --> 02:08:45,340
You've been.
Duncan sent you a fucking.

2834
02:08:45,690 --> 02:08:47,710
Now all of a sudden you want to change 
governments.

2835
02:08:48,280 --> 02:08:50,440
Well,
I mean look at fucking Cat Stevens.

2836
02:08:50,620 --> 02:08:52,060
Yeah.
That's not a good example.

2837
02:08:52,150 --> 02:08:55,950
Crazy asshole.
Fucking murder of Salmon Rushdie.

2838
02:08:55,990 --> 02:08:56,800
Get outta here,
man.

2839
02:08:57,510 --> 02:09:01,570
Artists didn't work for prince when 
Prince did it for,

2840
02:09:01,580 --> 02:09:03,730
um,
recording rights reasons.

2841
02:09:03,770 --> 02:09:07,360
Oh really?
An issue with them owning his name.

2842
02:09:07,480 --> 02:09:09,250
I don't think it.
I don't think it always works,

2843
02:09:09,251 --> 02:09:10,690
I think,
but I think sometimes I do.

2844
02:09:10,691 --> 02:09:12,880
I can understand the usefulness of it as
a tool.

2845
02:09:13,090 --> 02:09:18,090
I can understand it as a way to like 
create the differentiation between 

2846
02:09:18,090 --> 02:09:22,080
whatever the person that you were in 
your earlier phases and who you've 

2847
02:09:22,080 --> 02:09:22,600
become.
I don't think it's always good.

2848
02:09:22,870 --> 02:09:27,870
I think if people allow me to name them,
I will name them beautiful names that 

2849
02:09:27,870 --> 02:09:28,400
there'll be quite pleased with.
How crazy is it?

2850
02:09:28,401 --> 02:09:30,490
The prince changed his name to a fucking
symbol.

2851
02:09:30,550 --> 02:09:32,530
What?
What an amazing move that was.

2852
02:09:32,920 --> 02:09:34,390
Art.
It's really an amazing,

2853
02:09:34,840 --> 02:09:36,880
amazing move.
I mean,

2854
02:09:36,910 --> 02:09:41,910
that's.
That's how you get out of a legal 

2855
02:09:41,910 --> 02:09:41,910
contract.
You're not even a name anymore.

2856
02:09:41,910 --> 02:09:42,010
It's just so fucking squiggly,
crazy thing.

2857
02:09:44,120 --> 02:09:44,820
You know what I mean?
The,

2858
02:09:44,840 --> 02:09:49,840
the,
the language of contracts are so 

2859
02:09:49,840 --> 02:09:49,840
ridiculous in the first place.
The idea that there's anything you could

2860
02:09:49,840 --> 02:09:54,580
ever sign away where that person owned 
you and your likeness.

2861
02:09:54,850 --> 02:09:58,230
How the fuck can you sell that?
You don't own that anymore.

2862
02:09:58,250 --> 02:10:03,250
You can't use your own likeness.
Now you have to use this crazy symbol 

2863
02:10:03,250 --> 02:10:05,080
really in signature.
Just like the signing shit.

2864
02:10:05,540 --> 02:10:10,540
Give up that name.
You give up the name Prince or Duncan 

2865
02:10:10,540 --> 02:10:10,540
Trussell,
you know,

2866
02:10:10,540 --> 02:10:13,920
or especially if it's like a Larry the 
cable guy thing where it was a name he 

2867
02:10:13,920 --> 02:10:13,920
made up.
You know,

2868
02:10:13,920 --> 02:10:16,690
you get a proper.
My intellectual property.

2869
02:10:16,691 --> 02:10:19,060
My first name,
my first name is Charles.

2870
02:10:19,210 --> 02:10:24,210
My name is Charles Charles Duncan.
Trussell is now the new,

2871
02:10:24,730 --> 02:10:29,180
the latest name on twitter right now.
Sean.

2872
02:10:29,210 --> 02:10:34,210
With that,
the problem is that God is going to 

2873
02:10:34,210 --> 02:10:36,141
confuse everybody.
Going to have a picture of you that 

2874
02:10:36,141 --> 02:10:38,231
looks exactly like your twitter picture 
and when you change and he's just going 

2875
02:10:38,231 --> 02:10:38,240
to copy and paste it,
make his own twitter picture.

2876
02:10:39,140 --> 02:10:44,140
There's always some mystery.
You have an issue.

2877
02:10:45,141 --> 02:10:50,141
Every time you have an issue,
he's going to know a little bit more of 

2878
02:10:50,141 --> 02:10:52,720
a fixture issue and he's going to give 
you some awesome advice and you can 

2879
02:10:52,720 --> 02:10:53,360
start really getting freaked out as to 
how this is fake.

2880
02:10:53,361 --> 02:10:58,361
Duncan trussell really knows how to 
manage the real Duncan trussell's life 

2881
02:10:58,361 --> 02:11:00,800
and then you eventually just going to 
live under the assumption that this fake

2882
02:11:00,801 --> 02:11:05,801
twitter account,
Charles Duncan trussell is actually the 

2883
02:11:05,801 --> 02:11:05,801
universe giving you advice through 
twitter.

2884
02:11:05,801 --> 02:11:07,400
Can't wait.
Charles can't wait to meet.

2885
02:11:08,180 --> 02:11:13,180
You're not going to get to meet them.
You're going to get to communicate with 

2886
02:11:13,180 --> 02:11:15,101
them online.
But Charles Duncan trussell will be 

2887
02:11:15,101 --> 02:11:15,101
given you information about what's about
to happen.

2888
02:11:15,101 --> 02:11:18,731
So Joseph,
are you about to start a twitter 

2889
02:11:18,731 --> 02:11:18,731
account?
No,

2890
02:11:18,731 --> 02:11:18,731
I'm not doing shit.
The Universe is going to do this for us.

2891
02:11:18,731 --> 02:11:18,770
I love it.

2892
02:11:19,100 --> 02:11:23,750
Charles Duncan towards what do you have 
to do is now you know,

2893
02:11:23,751 --> 02:11:26,090
you have various untold issues in your 
life.

2894
02:11:26,091 --> 02:11:29,720
I'm sure we all do.
Get online and tweet them and then say,

2895
02:11:29,930 --> 02:11:31,760
Charles Duncan Trussell,
what should I do now?

2896
02:11:32,120 --> 02:11:37,120
And it's like calling them so I can't 
imagine you'll come with stupid Charles 

2897
02:11:39,910 --> 02:11:43,030
and I paid them when I was a kid.
My name's Joe.

2898
02:11:43,040 --> 02:11:44,230
It's like,
well I was born jets.

2899
02:11:45,420 --> 02:11:50,420
I started off of course Charles and then
my parents I think started just calling 

2900
02:11:50,420 --> 02:11:54,401
me dunk and then I decided that I want 
it to be called Duncan and instead of 

2901
02:11:54,401 --> 02:11:59,231
Charles and so then that's when I became
maybe because you knew that one day you 

2902
02:11:59,231 --> 02:11:59,950
would work with flusher,
so it wasn't even.

2903
02:12:03,050 --> 02:12:05,840
It's not even your middle name.
It's my middle name.

2904
02:12:06,110 --> 02:12:07,760
They just added it later.
No,

2905
02:12:07,910 --> 02:12:12,260
sometimes for some reason in the West 
when we name people will give them three

2906
02:12:12,261 --> 02:12:14,030
names.
It won't just be a first.

2907
02:12:14,740 --> 02:12:16,880
Yeah,
it'll be like Joseph James Rogan,

2908
02:12:16,910 --> 02:12:20,220
Joseph James Rogan,
Finnegan extra.

2909
02:12:20,240 --> 02:12:22,850
Now summary.
The whole thing's just idiotic.

2910
02:12:22,851 --> 02:12:27,110
And Brian Allen Bar.
So yeah,

2911
02:12:27,120 --> 02:12:29,900
you just picked you.
You got to fucking pick this name,

2912
02:12:30,200 --> 02:12:35,200
you know,
you gotta like you can choose your 

2913
02:12:35,200 --> 02:12:37,031
middle name or your first name.
They in fact that there is a first name 

2914
02:12:37,031 --> 02:12:37,370
and some people,
they're so narcissistic.

2915
02:12:37,400 --> 02:12:42,400
They just named their kids after 
themselves and that's where you're 

2916
02:12:42,400 --> 02:12:42,400
running your jackets.
And third,

2917
02:12:42,400 --> 02:12:44,600
George Foreman,
George Foreman named all of his kids.

2918
02:12:44,601 --> 02:12:49,601
George Echos.
Now you're making a little fucking 

2919
02:12:49,601 --> 02:12:50,200
genetic echo is named after.
You know.

2920
02:12:50,201 --> 02:12:52,970
It's just a terrible thing to put into 
someone's mind.

2921
02:12:53,390 --> 02:12:58,390
Yeah.
My whole family is completely on 

2922
02:12:58,390 --> 02:12:58,390
original.

2923
02:12:58,390 --> 02:12:58,390
I was Joe.
My father's name was Joe.

2924
02:12:58,390 --> 02:13:03,070
My grandfather's name was Joe.
My grandmother's name was really 

2925
02:13:03,070 --> 02:13:03,350
completely unoriginal.
Just.

2926
02:13:03,430 --> 02:13:04,310
Yeah.
Yeah,

2927
02:13:05,220 --> 02:13:08,960
very well.
It was the fact I really requested a lot

2928
02:13:08,961 --> 02:13:10,160
of Joe.
That's what I wanted.

2929
02:13:10,460 --> 02:13:12,770
So I just in my life,
in my lineage,

2930
02:13:12,771 --> 02:13:17,771
you know,
when I was creating myself in my 

2931
02:13:17,771 --> 02:13:17,771
imagination,
I just thought,

2932
02:13:17,771 --> 02:13:20,411
I want to really see what happens.
If you overdose on Joe Joe's the gate 

2933
02:13:20,630 --> 02:13:22,610
swinging well,
who knows?

2934
02:13:22,790 --> 02:13:24,970
Well,
it's unoriginal names.

2935
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:27,300
The Fox.
Everybody's joke.

2936
02:13:27,370 --> 02:13:29,150
Come on everybody.
Really?

2937
02:13:29,740 --> 02:13:32,100
Everyone's Brian.
You're Brian Allen.

2938
02:13:32,180 --> 02:13:35,290
Can you imagine if you became a standup 
and you called yourself Brian Allen b?

2939
02:13:35,291 --> 02:13:36,880
I need to go to clubs and everybody 
below.

2940
02:13:36,900 --> 02:13:41,900
What the fuck man?
I thought it was that black guy that 

2941
02:13:41,900 --> 02:13:41,900
interviews comedians.
They'd all be coming soon.

2942
02:13:42,840 --> 02:13:47,840
If you go onto Wolfram Alpha,
you can put your name in and see how 

2943
02:13:48,211 --> 02:13:50,490
many people right now are existing with 
your name.

2944
02:13:50,790 --> 02:13:55,790
Well,
that's pretty rarely want to feel 

2945
02:13:55,790 --> 02:13:55,790
insignificant or I've talked to one of 
the phone that Joe Rogan,

2946
02:13:55,790 --> 02:13:56,820
Joe Rogan.com
seemed like a nice guy.

2947
02:13:56,850 --> 02:14:01,850
Ex military guy,
but he wanted a lot of money for the 

2948
02:14:01,850 --> 02:14:01,850
site.
He saw dollar bills.

2949
02:14:01,850 --> 02:14:06,630
It also has got his own.
He's got his own website running there 

2950
02:14:06,630 --> 02:14:06,630
and he's been doing it for awhile.
Yeah,

2951
02:14:06,630 --> 02:14:08,790
he's an ex military guy.
He doesn't look like like ex military.

2952
02:14:08,791 --> 02:14:11,610
He looks more like a scientist or.
Well,

2953
02:14:11,611 --> 02:14:13,290
when they get older they look like older
men.

2954
02:14:13,970 --> 02:14:16,430
Weird.
Brian thinks you should have a flat top,

2955
02:14:16,431 --> 02:14:19,090
but a fucking knife and his teeth.
He.

2956
02:14:19,470 --> 02:14:22,320
It's like the opposite though.
Micro soldier.

2957
02:14:23,700 --> 02:14:25,080
So Duncan.
Yes sir.

2958
02:14:25,260 --> 02:14:29,100
We leave in the morning.
I know Chicago early.

2959
02:14:29,250 --> 02:14:32,400
I'm going to do the rosie o'donnell show
romantic.

2960
02:14:32,910 --> 02:14:35,520
I'm excited.
I'm a Rosie O'Donnell fan.

2961
02:14:35,830 --> 02:14:40,830
Hey,
can I say one thing real quick because 

2962
02:14:40,830 --> 02:14:40,830
I'm fucking cool happened and I want to 
announce it.

2963
02:14:41,980 --> 02:14:46,980
I did a south by south.
I got invited to go to south by 

2964
02:14:46,980 --> 02:14:47,170
southwest and they offered me this 
shitty deal.

2965
02:14:47,390 --> 02:14:49,360
I won't go into it here,
but if you want to see.

2966
02:14:49,420 --> 02:14:51,070
See the deal.
Look at Hitler.

2967
02:14:51,071 --> 02:14:53,400
Gets invited to south by southwest.
So great.

2968
02:14:53,420 --> 02:14:55,930
Is that just complaining because they 
don't fly the comics at and it's a.

2969
02:14:55,931 --> 02:15:00,931
it's just a generally a bum deal and I'm
just saying this because pretty much 

2970
02:15:00,931 --> 02:15:05,011
right after I did from that video,
I got invited to this awesome festival 

2971
02:15:05,011 --> 02:15:09,961
that's happening happening in Austin 
called the Moon Tower comedy festival 

2972
02:15:10,030 --> 02:15:15,030
and that's happening in April and they 
just like are doing the press releases 

2973
02:15:15,030 --> 02:15:17,350
today and I just think it's so fucking 
cool that they like or you know,

2974
02:15:17,351 --> 02:15:20,740
pay like they're showing that festivals 
can pay performance,

2975
02:15:20,741 --> 02:15:23,990
pay airfare and put them up,
which isn't that insane and idea.

2976
02:15:23,991 --> 02:15:25,250
It's just normal,
but it's

2977
02:15:25,390 --> 02:15:30,390
beautiful.
I don't understand how anybody ever got 

2978
02:15:30,390 --> 02:15:30,390
away with anybody working for free.
When you're making money.

2979
02:15:30,390 --> 02:15:33,580
I don't get the unless south by 
southwest with some amazing charity that

2980
02:15:33,581 --> 02:15:35,590
I don't understand that they're not.
It's not a charity,

2981
02:15:35,591 --> 02:15:38,080
but what are you sure?
Uh,

2982
02:15:38,081 --> 02:15:39,570
yeah.
I'm sure.

2983
02:15:39,690 --> 02:15:43,060
Yeah,
I know it's probably all these poor.

2984
02:15:43,061 --> 02:15:48,061
She wishes that,
that just to be sure I have a feeling 

2985
02:15:48,061 --> 02:15:50,410
they would have said it by now based on 
the awesome videos I've been making.

2986
02:15:50,680 --> 02:15:50,980
The.
Yeah,

2987
02:15:50,981 --> 02:15:51,980
let's look up and stuff.
I said,

2988
02:15:51,990 --> 02:15:53,410
well,
you can't just assume like that,

2989
02:15:53,411 --> 02:15:58,120
right?
I'm getting my apology or start typing a

2990
02:15:58,270 --> 02:15:59,240
$10,000.
Right?

2991
02:15:59,310 --> 02:16:01,050
Charity.
That's nice.

2992
02:16:01,860 --> 02:16:03,960
Let's see.
Charity.

2993
02:16:04,470 --> 02:16:05,070
Let's see.

2994
02:16:06,270 --> 02:16:11,270
South by southwest,
it seems like they do some stuff for 

2995
02:16:11,270 --> 02:16:13,431
charity.
You can impact charity without being 

2996
02:16:13,431 --> 02:16:13,431
rich.

2997
02:16:13,431 --> 02:16:16,280
I'm sure that they do.
I'm sure it's south by southwest as 

2998
02:16:16,280 --> 02:16:18,801
charity,
but when you ask artists to perform for 

2999
02:16:18,801 --> 02:16:22,311
free at your festival that sponsored by 
16 million different corporations,

3000
02:16:22,621 --> 02:16:23,580
it's a bit of a charity,

3001
02:16:23,650 --> 02:16:28,650
strongest memory of south by south to 
south by southwest 2010 was a rooftop 

3002
02:16:28,650 --> 02:16:30,070
party when the by southwest

3003
02:16:30,070 --> 02:16:34,930
partygoers spontaneously raised $300 
towards the purchase of a wheelchair for

3004
02:16:34,931 --> 02:16:39,931
the nephew of one attendee.
The young man was paralyzed temporarily 

3005
02:16:39,931 --> 02:16:40,690
in the family.
Could not afford a wheelchair.

3006
02:16:40,691 --> 02:16:41,980
That's beautiful.
That's beautiful.

3007
02:16:42,270 --> 02:16:43,480
That's very nice.
That's nice and all,

3008
02:16:43,481 --> 02:16:48,481
but still so many answers and how many 
people are paying to go see south by 

3009
02:16:48,581 --> 02:16:49,990
southwest?
It's expensive.

3010
02:16:50,400 --> 02:16:50,970
Ah,
look,

3011
02:16:50,971 --> 02:16:55,971
I go to their website.
I think the cheapest passes around 100 

3012
02:16:55,971 --> 02:16:55,971
bucks,
but might be more than that.

3013
02:16:55,971 --> 02:17:00,900
Wow.
So they get everybody get everybody to 

3014
02:17:00,900 --> 02:17:00,900
work for free,
right?

3015
02:17:00,900 --> 02:17:00,900
They must pay some.
No,

3016
02:17:00,900 --> 02:17:03,580
I think some of the like a bigger names 
get paid,

3017
02:17:03,581 --> 02:17:08,581
but mostly after I did these videos,
mostly what I heard from people is that 

3018
02:17:08,581 --> 02:17:10,420
the idea that Co.
Here's the concept I'll to to play south

3019
02:17:10,421 --> 02:17:13,480
by southwest advocate.
THe idea behind it is,

3020
02:17:13,720 --> 02:17:15,670
hey man,
it's just we're all having fun out here.

3021
02:17:15,671 --> 02:17:20,671
It's a party.
It's a chance to like hang out with a 

3022
02:17:20,671 --> 02:17:20,671
bunch of other comics and have a good 
time.

3023
02:17:20,671 --> 02:17:21,870
We don't invite a lot of comics out,
so it's a,

3024
02:17:22,500 --> 02:17:27,500
it's a,
it's an honor to get invited out and 

3025
02:17:27,500 --> 02:17:29,521
you're going to get a chance to perform.
We'll put you up In someone's guest 

3026
02:17:29,521 --> 02:17:32,641
bedroom,
but we can't pay you and we can't pay 

3027
02:17:32,641 --> 02:17:35,110
for your airfare and we,
you know,

3028
02:17:35,250 --> 02:17:35,410
we.

3029
02:17:35,520 --> 02:17:37,540
You want to stay in a hotel,
you're going to have to pay for your own

3030
02:17:37,541 --> 02:17:42,541
hotel now.
I think that that coming from like a 

3031
02:17:42,541 --> 02:17:46,261
festival that really was a charity,
like the make a wish foundation or 

3032
02:17:46,261 --> 02:17:48,010
something that was solely raising money 
for charity or even a startup festival.

3033
02:17:48,011 --> 02:17:53,011
What about just a startup festival that 
seems really cool and isn't making any 

3034
02:17:53,011 --> 02:17:53,011
money?
All that.

3035
02:17:53,011 --> 02:17:55,840
I totally makes it makes sense to me.
It'd be really cool,

3036
02:17:56,020 --> 02:17:59,920
but I think when it's coming from a 
festival the size of south by southwest,

3037
02:18:00,130 --> 02:18:03,280
which is a giant festival,
I read that 30,000

3038
02:18:03,281 --> 02:18:08,281
people come through there a year and 
they're asking performers to come out 

3039
02:18:08,281 --> 02:18:10,090
for free and to pay for their own 
ticket.

3040
02:18:10,270 --> 02:18:13,720
I think there's something in that that's
pretty fucked up,

3041
02:18:13,750 --> 02:18:15,850
dear southwest airlines.
If you want me to come,

3042
02:18:15,851 --> 02:18:17,560
I'll totally do it and I'll pay for 
everything.

3043
02:18:17,561 --> 02:18:17,830
Thanks.

3044
02:18:20,400 --> 02:18:21,440
Airlines,
knucklehead.

3045
02:18:21,520 --> 02:18:24,680
No,
veronica rita was right.

3046
02:18:24,710 --> 02:18:29,710
It was fucking airline manner.
They don't even fly the comics,

3047
02:18:29,990 --> 02:18:32,100
so it really is.
I thought you were joking.

3048
02:18:33,120 --> 02:18:36,190
She told us that at dinner and we both 
laughed at her and were like,

3049
02:18:36,270 --> 02:18:37,080
like I was like,
oh,

3050
02:18:37,130 --> 02:18:39,080
you're so silly.
I thought you were right.

3051
02:18:39,180 --> 02:18:40,640
You too.
I thought you knew.

3052
02:18:40,820 --> 02:18:41,270
No,
I didn't.

3053
02:18:41,271 --> 02:18:41,630
No,

3054
02:18:41,850 --> 02:18:42,960
god damn it.
Brian,

3055
02:18:43,050 --> 02:18:45,450
you spread this information across the 
world.

3056
02:18:45,510 --> 02:18:47,020
Now you've confused.
No,

3057
02:18:47,210 --> 02:18:48,030
no,
no.

3058
02:18:48,100 --> 02:18:49,710
I don't know anything about.
I don't.

3059
02:18:49,740 --> 02:18:52,320
I don't look at them.
I think it must be an awesome hang.

3060
02:18:52,321 --> 02:18:54,120
I did one thing.
What's one?

3061
02:18:54,121 --> 02:18:56,580
One festival.
I did summerfest in milwaukee.

3062
02:18:56,581 --> 02:18:57,540
It was fucking great,
man.

3063
02:18:57,541 --> 02:19:02,541
I loved it,
but I felt weird because I'm on stage 

3064
02:19:02,541 --> 02:19:05,481
and I'm just doing my regular acts.
There's people with babies or holding 

3065
02:19:05,481 --> 02:19:05,520
the babies in the crime,
like this is just fucked up,

3066
02:19:05,550 --> 02:19:06,010
you know?
It's just,

3067
02:19:06,020 --> 02:19:11,020
it's just a.
I like doing stand up in a place where 

3068
02:19:11,020 --> 02:19:11,020
people come and see standup.
That's it.

3069
02:19:11,150 --> 02:19:12,510
That's it.
But no,

3070
02:19:12,511 --> 02:19:13,920
I think.
I think festivals.

3071
02:19:14,280 --> 02:19:16,140
I've done festivals,
I've sometimes they're fun.

3072
02:19:16,170 --> 02:19:21,170
I like I did the vancouver comedy 
festival that comedy festivals are 

3073
02:19:21,170 --> 02:19:24,531
different.
I'm saying performing at a music 

3074
02:19:24,531 --> 02:19:24,531
festival.
Yeah,

3075
02:19:24,531 --> 02:19:24,531
that's a little music.

3076
02:19:24,531 --> 02:19:25,360
Festivals are way more rowdy.
It's way this.

3077
02:19:25,610 --> 02:19:28,730
It's way more likely.
The people did not come to see that.

3078
02:19:30,080 --> 02:19:31,040
There's a big difference.
Man.

3079
02:19:31,060 --> 02:19:32,890
Comedy festivals are amazing.
Montreal,

3080
02:19:33,670 --> 02:19:35,450
montreal,
all several years.

3081
02:19:35,451 --> 02:19:39,080
I think I did it six years.
It was fucking great.

3082
02:19:40,060 --> 02:19:45,060
A whole town know montreal that 
literally has been privy to these 

3083
02:19:45,060 --> 02:19:49,691
festivals coming in every year.
So they have like this really like high 

3084
02:19:49,691 --> 02:19:51,140
palate for comedy.
It's a fucking great place.

3085
02:19:51,141 --> 02:19:54,110
Do comedy.
We were supposed to go back in march,

3086
02:19:54,410 --> 02:19:56,840
but uh,
unfortunately the ufc had a move.

3087
02:19:56,841 --> 02:20:01,841
It's a march date.
They had to move the montreal date 

3088
02:20:01,841 --> 02:20:04,381
because no champions were available and 
they were going to put together a big 

3089
02:20:04,381 --> 02:20:04,381
card for up there.
So they postponed it.

3090
02:20:04,381 --> 02:20:05,090
I was like,
damn,

3091
02:20:05,091 --> 02:20:07,040
I was really looking forward to going 
back to montreal.

3092
02:20:07,790 --> 02:20:08,210
Yeah.
Well,

3093
02:20:08,211 --> 02:20:09,890
you know what,
my montreal,

3094
02:20:10,610 --> 02:20:13,490
I don't care about like,
I don't want to come across like,

3095
02:20:13,491 --> 02:20:18,491
I'm like,
you gotta fucking you gotta pay up if 

3096
02:20:18,491 --> 02:20:18,491
you want me to.
It's not that at all.

3097
02:20:18,491 --> 02:20:20,990
It's like it's reasonable.
just acknowledge something,

3098
02:20:21,010 --> 02:20:23,020
you know,
they did.

3099
02:20:23,080 --> 02:20:23,710
Yeah,
you did.

3100
02:20:23,870 --> 02:20:27,290
Her pays people fly tower festival pays 
people,

3101
02:20:27,291 --> 02:20:30,100
sasquatch pays people and people have 
argued like standard

3102
02:20:30,210 --> 02:20:31,620
got really mad at,
you know,

3103
02:20:31,621 --> 02:20:36,621
what the uh,
the montreal people and started his own 

3104
02:20:36,621 --> 02:20:36,621
thing just for spite,
you know,

3105
02:20:36,621 --> 02:20:38,010
they call the just for laughs.
So he would do it in town.

3106
02:20:38,370 --> 02:20:39,240
That it.
Yeah,

3107
02:20:39,870 --> 02:20:41,080
there you go.
So,

3108
02:20:41,100 --> 02:20:42,870
but you know when,
if you,

3109
02:20:42,970 --> 02:20:45,840
if you,
if you look at what they're doing,

3110
02:20:45,841 --> 02:20:48,240
like even if you think that they should 
be paying more,

3111
02:20:48,360 --> 02:20:49,290
they're like,
stan hope does.

3112
02:20:49,500 --> 02:20:51,360
It's fucking infinitely better than 
nothing.

3113
02:20:51,420 --> 02:20:53,100
Nothing.
Nothing's ridiculous.

3114
02:20:53,130 --> 02:20:54,330
Nothing,
no hotel room,

3115
02:20:54,590 --> 02:20:55,230
no airfare.

3116
02:20:55,850 --> 02:20:56,510
Well no.
They said,

3117
02:20:56,511 --> 02:20:58,040
here's the.
They said no hotel room,

3118
02:20:58,041 --> 02:21:01,010
but they say you can stay in someone's 
guest bedroom.

3119
02:21:01,070 --> 02:21:06,070
The fuck here.
Stand over someone who live in those 

3120
02:21:06,070 --> 02:21:09,470
days.
The other thing that the guy said to me 

3121
02:21:09,470 --> 02:21:09,560
during these emails and the guy who 
books it is a super nice guy.

3122
02:21:09,780 --> 02:21:14,780
I,
I started feeling guilty because he's a 

3123
02:21:14,780 --> 02:21:14,810
really nice guy,
very friendly guy.

3124
02:21:14,811 --> 02:21:15,770
But he would,
he,

3125
02:21:15,860 --> 02:21:18,830
he couldn't acknowledge the one point 
that I was making,

3126
02:21:18,831 --> 02:21:23,831
which is that if you're charging tickets
for people to come see performers,

3127
02:21:24,920 --> 02:21:27,140
you have to pay the performers 
something.

3128
02:21:27,141 --> 02:21:29,450
It's just basic logic.
That's all.

3129
02:21:29,600 --> 02:21:31,370
Maybe you don't have enough to pay for 
everything.

3130
02:21:31,371 --> 02:21:32,750
Maybe the performers,
you know,

3131
02:21:32,751 --> 02:21:35,840
you can only give them in a hotel and 
get them out there but don't.

3132
02:21:36,080 --> 02:21:37,760
Because If you're making them pay for 
everything,

3133
02:21:37,761 --> 02:21:39,110
then they're subsidizing your food.

3134
02:21:39,220 --> 02:21:42,000
Go though just for it to be fun in my 
opinion,

3135
02:21:42,001 --> 02:21:47,001
like like if you're looking at ces,
the consumer electronics show or any of 

3136
02:21:47,001 --> 02:21:51,911
these huge things,
people are usually going because it's 

3137
02:21:51,911 --> 02:21:55,150
what they love and it's a collection and
to me I would go just because it would 

3138
02:21:55,150 --> 02:21:58,691
be an awesome party.
It'd be awesome doing it and here's the 

3139
02:21:58,691 --> 02:21:58,691
thing,
man,

3140
02:21:58,691 --> 02:21:59,420
here's the problem with that.
In my mind,

3141
02:21:59,421 --> 02:22:04,421
the thing that I can't get past is that 
the reason it's fun and the reason 

3142
02:22:04,421 --> 02:22:08,291
people are going,
it's because the great fucking 

3143
02:22:08,291 --> 02:22:08,291
performers that are there,
the movies,

3144
02:22:08,291 --> 02:22:12,251
unquestionably it wasn't.
That was the main argument about the 

3145
02:22:12,251 --> 02:22:12,251
comedy store.
Remember the main argument,

3146
02:22:12,251 --> 02:22:16,210
the ecommerce stores,
they were making it out that it was an 

3147
02:22:16,210 --> 02:22:17,150
honor to perform at this star.
If they did that every day.

3148
02:22:17,630 --> 02:22:20,150
You guys are crazy because this is not.
This is just a box.

3149
02:22:20,151 --> 02:22:25,151
We have a microphone and you turn it on.
What you're selling here is art and the 

3150
02:22:25,151 --> 02:22:25,530
artists are what create the art you're 
selling.

3151
02:22:25,560 --> 02:22:26,100
Are you

3152
02:22:26,110 --> 02:22:27,720
selling standup comedy?
You're not.

3153
02:22:27,721 --> 02:22:31,020
You're not selling a spot and yeah,
it is a popular spot.

3154
02:22:31,170 --> 02:22:34,680
It's a popular spot because of the 
artists that performed the period.

3155
02:22:34,710 --> 02:22:36,930
That's it.
And that's the big festivals,

3156
02:22:37,180 --> 02:22:39,750
the same truth.
It's the exact same truth.

3157
02:22:39,960 --> 02:22:44,960
And,
and festivals who are making a shitload 

3158
02:22:44,960 --> 02:22:46,290
of money have this awesome opportunity 
to make things fair.

3159
02:22:46,710 --> 02:22:48,690
Fair.
That's all you gotta do is make it fair.

3160
02:22:48,710 --> 02:22:51,210
Isn't the,
these concerts like south by southwest,

3161
02:22:51,240 --> 02:22:52,440
isn't this where like,
you know,

3162
02:22:52,441 --> 02:22:53,940
like,
like people go to go,

3163
02:22:53,941 --> 02:22:58,941
hey,
they were looking for people for the 

3164
02:22:58,941 --> 02:22:58,941
next year six,
but with vancouver,

3165
02:22:58,941 --> 02:22:59,820
with montreal,
with,

3166
02:22:59,821 --> 02:23:02,460
and you can say that for any festival.
It is that right?

3167
02:23:02,461 --> 02:23:06,270
It is something where you for comedy 
that hasn't set up man,

3168
02:23:06,271 --> 02:23:08,310
they get set up and then they become 
law.

3169
02:23:08,550 --> 02:23:11,340
They'd become.
This is just how it's done and there's a

3170
02:23:11,341 --> 02:23:13,920
lot of them that don't make any fucking 
sense and this is one of them.

3171
02:23:13,950 --> 02:23:17,580
The idea that you were performed with 
something where people profit,

3172
02:23:17,790 --> 02:23:20,940
you know,
they make a profit and just pay a little

3173
02:23:20,941 --> 02:23:22,860
bit.
That's the thing With this guy,

3174
02:23:22,890 --> 02:23:24,850
the guy through my emails,
this guy charlie,

3175
02:23:24,851 --> 02:23:27,030
he seemed really passionate about 
comedy.

3176
02:23:27,270 --> 02:23:30,660
He seemed like a really cool guy.
It's just if he would just,

3177
02:23:30,790 --> 02:23:35,790
you know,
if they would just make one small step 

3178
02:23:35,790 --> 02:23:35,790
in the direction of being like,
you know what?

3179
02:23:35,790 --> 02:23:39,000
We thought about it.
We should pay airfare for the performers

3180
02:23:39,001 --> 02:23:41,610
to come up with something that's 
sponsored by southwest.

3181
02:23:41,650 --> 02:23:44,410
They should be a no brainer,
share fair.

3182
02:23:44,520 --> 02:23:48,210
Just some discount which is drive so 
much fucking business to the town.

3183
02:23:48,211 --> 02:23:50,130
To me,
and I'm looking at an article about nine

3184
02:23:50,131 --> 02:23:55,131
ways to profit from south by southwest,
but if you weren't there and they're 

3185
02:23:55,131 --> 02:23:57,600
talking about how much figuring out how 
to profit from this gathering of people,

3186
02:23:57,860 --> 02:23:58,680
isn't that amazing?

3187
02:23:58,800 --> 02:24:03,800
That's like,
would you look at human beings as some 

3188
02:24:03,800 --> 02:24:03,810
sort of a life form and you look at just
what this article says,

3189
02:24:03,811 --> 02:24:05,280
nine ways to profit from south by 
southwest.

3190
02:24:05,281 --> 02:24:10,281
Even if you weren't there,
the idea that you could be extracting 

3191
02:24:10,281 --> 02:24:11,420
resources from some spot.
You're nowhere near there.

3192
02:24:11,770 --> 02:24:16,770
You don't even go there and you're just 
putting out a way to profit to profit 

3193
02:24:16,770 --> 02:24:16,770
and what is that?
What are you doing?

3194
02:24:16,770 --> 02:24:21,471
You're profiting.
You're pulling money out somehow or 

3195
02:24:21,471 --> 02:24:23,571
another from someplace.
I'm not saying you're doing it 

3196
02:24:23,571 --> 02:24:26,511
illegally.
I'm not saying you're doing anything 

3197
02:24:26,511 --> 02:24:26,511
wrong,
but the idea that you can do that,

3198
02:24:26,511 --> 02:24:28,890
the idea that you're just signing checks
and sending things out,

3199
02:24:29,040 --> 02:24:30,870
and I'm extracting money from a 
situation.

3200
02:24:31,010 --> 02:24:32,340
There's a lot of people in that one 
spot.

3201
02:24:32,460 --> 02:24:34,590
When he invented that one spot and sell 
them things,

3202
02:24:34,770 --> 02:24:36,890
it's very fucking strange.
Weird.

3203
02:24:36,960 --> 02:24:39,270
Really strange.
When people are weird as,

3204
02:24:39,271 --> 02:24:40,110
fuck,
man,

3205
02:24:40,140 --> 02:24:44,160
when is south by southwest in march.
I don't remember what we need to do.

3206
02:24:44,200 --> 02:24:45,000
You don't.
We need to do.

3207
02:24:45,150 --> 02:24:47,190
We need to put together an la comedy 
festival.

3208
02:24:47,430 --> 02:24:50,530
La is one of the best places to know our
own.

3209
02:24:52,830 --> 02:24:56,790
I want to join anybody else's first.
Then you have to put their people on the

3210
02:24:57,600 --> 02:24:59,700
comedy festival.
An ice comedy festival.

3211
02:24:59,990 --> 02:25:00,520
I,
I'll,

3212
02:25:00,780 --> 02:25:03,090
I'll tell you what,
it's not a comedy festival,

3213
02:25:03,091 --> 02:25:07,230
but I did this.
My favorite festival that I ever did was

3214
02:25:07,231 --> 02:25:08,940
furries.
Yeah.

3215
02:25:09,240 --> 02:25:11,010
How'd you know?
I love furries.

3216
02:25:11,011 --> 02:25:15,790
I love dressing up like at raccoon go.
Taylor notel.

3217
02:25:16,080 --> 02:25:18,180
uh,
I know to tell it makes it hard for them

3218
02:25:18,181 --> 02:25:19,210
to grab your ass.
Yeah.

3219
02:25:19,710 --> 02:25:24,290
I find that some target targets in the 
way basketball,

3220
02:25:24,291 --> 02:25:25,960
you know,
there's this place up north,

3221
02:25:26,020 --> 02:25:30,130
there's this place called Nevada city 
and they have this film fest a lot there

3222
02:25:30,131 --> 02:25:35,131
and that place has the fucking deepest 
hardcore hippies I've ever seen in my 

3223
02:25:35,711 --> 02:25:37,270
life.
And there's this beautiful river.

3224
02:25:37,271 --> 02:25:42,271
I think it's the uma river that runs 
through there and in the day you go 

3225
02:25:42,271 --> 02:25:44,500
swimming in this river,
it's so fucking beautiful.

3226
02:25:44,500 --> 02:25:47,050
It's like this primordial,
wherever you jump off rocks.

3227
02:25:47,920 --> 02:25:50,690
It's called Nevada city,
Nevada city council,

3228
02:25:50,880 --> 02:25:51,610
Nevada.
It's.

3229
02:25:51,630 --> 02:25:54,460
They pronounce it Nevada.
It's where all the Nevada city.

3230
02:25:54,461 --> 02:25:55,620
Yeah.
It's like there's a,

3231
02:25:56,020 --> 02:25:57,790
I think that California.
Yes,

3232
02:25:57,940 --> 02:25:59,860
that's right.
Where you're getting into what I think,

3233
02:25:59,861 --> 02:26:02,500
and I may be wrong about this,
what is called the emerald triangle.

3234
02:26:02,501 --> 02:26:03,720
It's like,
right where you start getting more.

3235
02:26:03,990 --> 02:26:08,760
They grow the buds for the dispensary,
slam a jail combine fun.

3236
02:26:08,980 --> 02:26:10,420
Man.
That's a dangerous area too,

3237
02:26:10,421 --> 02:26:15,421
because they've got a lot of mexican 
people that go up there to grow pot and 

3238
02:26:15,421 --> 02:26:15,910
guys actually stay there.
It's really amazing.

3239
02:26:15,911 --> 02:26:18,340
I Watched a documentary on it on that 
show.

3240
02:26:18,710 --> 02:26:22,090
God damn it,
a vanguard ever ever see that show.

3241
02:26:22,300 --> 02:26:24,910
I believe it's on true tv.
One of those reality tv networks.

3242
02:26:25,090 --> 02:26:30,090
Anyway,
these people did an investigative 

3243
02:26:30,090 --> 02:26:30,090
journalism thing where they went into 
the woods up there,

3244
02:26:30,090 --> 02:26:34,981
very dense woods up there,
and they found like these crazy 

3245
02:26:34,981 --> 02:26:34,981
campsites.

3246
02:26:34,981 --> 02:26:37,600
So these guys had set up with this guy 
who was the saint of narcotics.

3247
02:26:38,110 --> 02:26:39,290
Narcotic st.
Yeah.

3248
02:26:39,650 --> 02:26:41,020
You know,
I forget his name.

3249
02:26:41,021 --> 02:26:42,730
Something to narco,
you know,

3250
02:26:42,731 --> 02:26:43,540
and it's like,
wow,

3251
02:26:43,541 --> 02:26:46,750
they have a saint to watch over them 
while they're growing drugs.

3252
02:26:47,770 --> 02:26:48,580
Why not?
Whatever,

3253
02:26:48,960 --> 02:26:53,960
because the thing is,
it's like if you think about what 

3254
02:26:53,960 --> 02:26:53,960
they're doing,
nothing wrong.

3255
02:26:53,960 --> 02:26:55,510
Growing drugs,
nothing wrong with being a farmer.

3256
02:26:55,630 --> 02:26:57,220
You're just grabbing something out of 
the ground.

3257
02:26:57,370 --> 02:26:59,410
You're not doing anything wrong.
You're not evil,

3258
02:26:59,411 --> 02:27:02,140
you're not bad.
But because we happen to exist at a time

3259
02:27:02,141 --> 02:27:07,141
period in human history or somehow 
idiots have determined that certain 

3260
02:27:07,141 --> 02:27:07,570
things that grow out of the ground or 
fucking bad,

3261
02:27:07,930 --> 02:27:10,330
not only on certain things that have 
killed anybody.

3262
02:27:10,331 --> 02:27:14,290
And how about these people are moving 
through the night with night vision on.

3263
02:27:14,410 --> 02:27:19,410
They started fucking hiking at 4:00
in the morning because I had to walk 

3264
02:27:19,410 --> 02:27:20,950
like five hours to get to these fucking 
people to catch them.

3265
02:27:21,160 --> 02:27:21,900
You know?
So the,

3266
02:27:21,970 --> 02:27:26,810
these guys are hiking through the woods 
at night to get farmers to catch farmer.

3267
02:27:26,820 --> 02:27:29,540
Go get mexican farmers catcher,
mexican,

3268
02:27:29,720 --> 02:27:33,730
mexican fucking god of drugs.
We kind of stopped these people.

3269
02:27:33,760 --> 02:27:35,650
That's all they are.
Anyone who grows pot,

3270
02:27:35,710 --> 02:27:37,120
you're just a farmer,
a farmer,

3271
02:27:37,160 --> 02:27:38,300
you know.
And it's amazing that they,

3272
02:27:38,301 --> 02:27:40,900
they forced these people to be fucking.
Why do they have guns?

3273
02:27:40,901 --> 02:27:42,310
They have guns because they have to have
guns.

3274
02:27:42,370 --> 02:27:47,370
They have guns because they're all the 
way up here because they can't grow it 

3275
02:27:47,370 --> 02:27:49,741
down there.
They'll get shot in the head and steal 

3276
02:27:49,741 --> 02:27:49,741
their shit.
If you made it illegal to grow corn,

3277
02:27:49,741 --> 02:27:52,820
corn farmers would have fucking gun.
It's like anytime it's,

3278
02:27:53,200 --> 02:27:54,310
it's a,
it's a.

3279
02:27:54,340 --> 02:27:55,390
Yeah,
you have to defend you.

3280
02:27:55,540 --> 02:27:59,610
It's such a fucking.
The consciousness of this country,

3281
02:27:59,620 --> 02:28:03,280
this world does this,
this global entity,

3282
02:28:03,460 --> 02:28:08,460
this human race,
the consciousness of this human race is 

3283
02:28:08,460 --> 02:28:11,581
altering right in front of our eyes with
the internet and the internet and 

3284
02:28:11,920 --> 02:28:16,920
psychedelic experiences together.
That shit has changed more in this 

3285
02:28:18,700 --> 02:28:20,950
hundred years than at any time ever.
The.

3286
02:28:21,160 --> 02:28:22,100
The idea

3287
02:28:22,100 --> 02:28:26,270
of how people feel about life on earth,
it's so different.

3288
02:28:26,320 --> 02:28:31,320
yeah.
It's so different than at any time and 

3289
02:28:31,320 --> 02:28:31,320
we're riding the wave.
We're lucky.

3290
02:28:31,320 --> 02:28:35,770
We're so lucky.
We're were riding with or we are in a 

3291
02:28:35,770 --> 02:28:40,001
dream that is symbolic of our own life 
and we're slowly decaying and that's 

3292
02:28:40,001 --> 02:28:41,330
when there's a great battle.
Will the shit hit the fan?

3293
02:28:41,331 --> 02:28:46,331
I will.
They come up with an intervention that 

3294
02:28:46,331 --> 02:28:47,471
makes me live forever.
Tune in next week until I fucking go 

3295
02:28:47,471 --> 02:28:49,070
head on into a semi and wake up 15 years
old going to school again.

3296
02:28:51,480 --> 02:28:52,110
We're going to have the

3297
02:28:52,370 --> 02:28:53,620
cold.
Oh,

3298
02:28:53,630 --> 02:28:55,940
it's the best already.
It's already.

3299
02:28:56,580 --> 02:28:59,210
People are drawn fucking pictures of us.
You ever seen that thing up there?

3300
02:28:59,600 --> 02:29:01,190
what's that?
Homeboy's name pants.

3301
02:29:01,220 --> 02:29:03,140
What is his name?
A formal sweatpants.

3302
02:29:03,160 --> 02:29:04,600
Formal sweatpants.
You can.

3303
02:29:04,601 --> 02:29:09,601
You could buy that joe rogan experience 
a poster from him if you haven't seen 

3304
02:29:09,601 --> 02:29:09,601
it.
It's fucking awesome.

3305
02:29:09,601 --> 02:29:11,750
What's his website?
Formal sweatpants.com.

3306
02:29:11,780 --> 02:29:13,940
Just the coolest thing.
I mean with all this stuff,

3307
02:29:13,941 --> 02:29:18,941
I just want you guys to all know that I 
am 100 percent humbled,

3308
02:29:19,520 --> 02:29:21,560
blown away.
Flattered.

3309
02:29:21,561 --> 02:29:26,561
I can't use enough positive words to 
describe how awesome it is that You 

3310
02:29:26,561 --> 02:29:26,840
guys,
first of all,

3311
02:29:26,850 --> 02:29:29,060
just like the show,
but then that you make like these little

3312
02:29:29,061 --> 02:29:34,061
videos and little.
I mean there's so many cool videos of 

3313
02:29:34,061 --> 02:29:36,020
rants of just you and I just you and I 
just going off about stuff.

3314
02:29:36,240 --> 02:29:37,600
Stick man.
That,

3315
02:29:37,610 --> 02:29:38,470
that,
that,

3316
02:29:38,500 --> 02:29:41,220
that combination is the coolest stuff 
ever.

3317
02:29:41,221 --> 02:29:42,570
Man.
That stuff really,

3318
02:29:42,990 --> 02:29:46,290
really makes me happy.
Like when we went our that rant,

3319
02:29:46,291 --> 02:29:51,291
we had landed on Alex Jones where I was 
talking about Alex Jones getting 

3320
02:29:51,291 --> 02:29:54,930
arrested and that landed on his website.
That was intense,

3321
02:29:54,931 --> 02:29:55,890
man.
I was like,

3322
02:29:56,100 --> 02:29:56,940
fuck,
we're going to.

3323
02:29:57,720 --> 02:30:02,720
We're going to end up in a fucking fema 
camp that's like I felt a real because I

3324
02:30:03,061 --> 02:30:03,930
was like,
no,

3325
02:30:03,931 --> 02:30:08,931
you know why we're not going to.
Because we can talk to the fucking 

3326
02:30:08,931 --> 02:30:08,931
troops.
We can talk to the cops.

3327
02:30:08,931 --> 02:30:13,821
We communicate to those people and 
they're not going to do with these 

3328
02:30:13,821 --> 02:30:16,761
assholes are telling them to do.
That's ultimately a real problem with 

3329
02:30:16,761 --> 02:30:18,420
civil unrest in this country.
The fucking genie's out of the bottle.

3330
02:30:18,421 --> 02:30:19,470
The cops,
the fireman.

3331
02:30:19,471 --> 02:30:21,600
Everybody knows that this is a fucking 
mess.

3332
02:30:21,720 --> 02:30:24,110
Everybody knows that these people are 
just.

3333
02:30:24,140 --> 02:30:27,030
They're just doing what you're supposed 
to do when you're an american,

3334
02:30:27,031 --> 02:30:29,820
you're.
They're protesting some gross injustices

3335
02:30:29,821 --> 02:30:34,821
and they don't know exactly how to do it
and the way I've described them is that 

3336
02:30:34,821 --> 02:30:37,581
there's a fucking.
There's a problem and their white blood 

3337
02:30:37,581 --> 02:30:40,521
cells and they're surrounding this 
problem and they don't know how to 

3338
02:30:40,521 --> 02:30:40,521
conquer it and they don't know what to 
do,

3339
02:30:40,521 --> 02:30:42,450
but the fact that so many people have 
gravitated towards one area,

3340
02:30:42,570 --> 02:30:47,570
if you were looking at any other 
organism and this sort of a situation 

3341
02:30:47,570 --> 02:30:47,570
was happening,
you're like,

3342
02:30:47,570 --> 02:30:48,010
well,
clearly there's some sort of a disease.

3343
02:30:48,010 --> 02:30:49,470
There's an Illness,
there's a sickness,

3344
02:30:49,620 --> 02:30:52,950
there's an issue that's being addressed.
Something very,

3345
02:30:52,951 --> 02:30:57,790
very important is being addressed here.
Babies in the background here,

3346
02:30:58,400 --> 02:31:03,220
my kids are screaming,
little munchkins talking trussell monday

3347
02:31:03,240 --> 02:31:06,180
you're going to have some little 
munchkins love some little munchkins.

3348
02:31:06,181 --> 02:31:06,650
Well,
you're a.

3349
02:31:06,720 --> 02:31:09,330
You're a good doggie daddy.
Ah,

3350
02:31:09,331 --> 02:31:10,800
yeah.
We got rid of our five puppies.

3351
02:31:10,801 --> 02:31:12,280
We have all of them.
That's awesome.

3352
02:31:12,290 --> 02:31:15,110
Adam all and get home to our properties.
How cute are there?

3353
02:31:15,230 --> 02:31:16,630
How can you not say,
you know,

3354
02:31:16,650 --> 02:31:18,840
you go over there and you see them.
You just gotta take a man.

3355
02:31:19,260 --> 02:31:19,620
Well,
yeah,

3356
02:31:19,621 --> 02:31:20,070
I knew that

3357
02:31:20,070 --> 02:31:25,070
we'd have no problem getting man.
There is nothing like the power of 

3358
02:31:25,070 --> 02:31:29,091
fucking a young things.
It's so powerful that they can wake you 

3359
02:31:29,091 --> 02:31:29,700
up at four in the mornings,
you know,

3360
02:31:29,710 --> 02:31:34,230
squeaking and you go in there and they 
will do jailbreaks where they would like

3361
02:31:34,231 --> 02:31:39,231
get out and suddenly the house is just 
flooded with chihuahua puppies that 

3362
02:31:39,231 --> 02:31:43,131
you're trying to like bring back in and 
so fun and they will always make you 

3363
02:31:43,131 --> 02:31:44,010
like,
you can't get angry at a puppy.

3364
02:31:44,060 --> 02:31:47,310
It's almost impossible.
They're so god damn cute.

3365
02:31:47,311 --> 02:31:52,311
It's amazing how nature is sort of 
engineered them nature and human beings 

3366
02:31:52,311 --> 02:31:56,211
have engineered them to be so god damn 
cute and so loving mean what's more 

3367
02:31:56,211 --> 02:31:56,880
loving a dog man.
So funny.

3368
02:31:56,881 --> 02:31:58,110
That's what my sister had.
Her kid,

3369
02:31:58,140 --> 02:32:00,420
she did the exact same thing as your 
man,

3370
02:32:00,480 --> 02:32:02,850
like immediately,
like who cares about the dog anymore?

3371
02:32:03,110 --> 02:32:05,610
Babies,
but you know what I mean?

3372
02:32:06,540 --> 02:32:07,890
I love playing on,
but yeah,

3373
02:32:07,891 --> 02:32:09,270
that's not your.
That's not a person.

3374
02:32:09,330 --> 02:32:10,770
Dogs and people are totally different 
things,

3375
02:32:10,771 --> 02:32:11,790
man.
You don't even understand,

3376
02:32:12,720 --> 02:32:16,110
but doesn't mean I don't love my dogs.
I love a little fucking baby.

3377
02:32:16,111 --> 02:32:17,010
One day,
man.

3378
02:32:18,400 --> 02:32:21,150
Fucking three.
I think we should just both get a baby.

3379
02:32:21,151 --> 02:32:26,151
Don't get it.
And you'll get one week and I get the 

3380
02:32:26,151 --> 02:32:26,151
next weekend.
Well,

3381
02:32:26,151 --> 02:32:29,370
I should let somebody.
We were a little bit of contest and 

3382
02:32:29,370 --> 02:32:30,180
there'll be able to film the baby coming
out.

3383
02:32:30,390 --> 02:32:33,900
So that will be whoever,
whoever did the best compilation video.

3384
02:32:33,901 --> 02:32:36,630
We'll give them access to your wife's 
vagina as the baby's coming out.

3385
02:32:36,631 --> 02:32:37,180
What do you say?
Well,

3386
02:32:37,230 --> 02:32:38,280
yeah,
it sounds great.

3387
02:32:38,340 --> 02:32:38,840
Sounds great.
Good.

3388
02:32:39,030 --> 02:32:39,660
Yeah.
Perfect.

3389
02:32:42,410 --> 02:32:44,000
What was the dude's name again?
Formal sweatpants.

3390
02:32:44,420 --> 02:32:49,420
Sweatpants doc.
And he's got the joe rogan experience 

3391
02:32:49,420 --> 02:32:51,861
poster.
I don't know how much you selling it 

3392
02:32:51,861 --> 02:32:51,861
for,
but it's an awesome piece of artwork.

3393
02:32:51,861 --> 02:32:52,860
I don't have any piece of this.
So it's all his.

3394
02:32:52,970 --> 02:32:55,170
I freely,
freely.

3395
02:32:55,171 --> 02:32:57,470
I have a poster endorsement.
You got a poster coming into.

3396
02:32:57,640 --> 02:32:58,820
Yeah,

3397
02:32:58,840 --> 02:32:59,580
Squad logo,

3398
02:32:59,610 --> 02:33:01,560
Yeah,
I did it a top 10 bitches.

3399
02:33:01,561 --> 02:33:03,360
Top 10 on itunes.
Holla at your boy.

3400
02:33:03,540 --> 02:33:08,460
Got as high as what is sex rather than a
pow coming up in the world.

3401
02:33:08,470 --> 02:33:13,470
Pitches trussell this pitch up.

02:33:22,011 --> 02:33:24,750
the ice house has two rooms.
It's in pasadena.

3407
02:33:24,751 --> 02:33:29,751
California at the annex is very small.
It's only 85 seats with a guy like doug 

3408
02:33:29,751 --> 02:33:29,751

That shit's gonna sell out quick.
So go to ice house.

3410

drafthouse and february.

3418
02:33:49,381 --> 02:33:50,610
look it up.
I don't have to exactly.

3419
02:33:50,611 --> 02:33:54,030
It's in Texas now in Maryland.
it's called the arlington drafthouse and

3420
02:33:54,031 --> 02:33:55,770
I'd love to see you guys there at 
arlington,

3421
02:33:55,771 --> 02:33:56,910
Maryland,
arlington.

3422
02:33:56,911 --> 02:33:58,080
Drafthouses.
What it's called,

3423
02:33:58,081 --> 02:34:00,310
just google it.
Arlington drafthouse is the,

3424
02:34:00,330 --> 02:34:05,330
uh,
the date is the second weekend in 

3425
02:34:05,330 --> 02:34:05,330
february.
I think I have to look at my calendar,

3426
02:34:05,330 --> 02:34:05,850
but I just.
Is that a,

3427
02:34:05,851 --> 02:34:07,470
um,
a place that you do on a regular?

3428
02:34:07,471 --> 02:34:09,180
You've done it for the first time I've 
done it.

3429
02:34:09,181 --> 02:34:10,370
It's in it apparently.
And uh,

3430
02:34:10,440 --> 02:34:15,440
it's a kind of like a movie theater and 
I've heard great things about it so bad.

3431
02:34:17,140 --> 02:34:17,930
Who got

3432
02:34:17,980 --> 02:34:20,000
you that gig?
My booking guide,

3433
02:34:20,020 --> 02:34:21,430
apa.
Nice.

3434
02:34:21,431 --> 02:34:22,580
That sounds like fun.
But yeah,

3435
02:34:22,590 --> 02:34:24,050
I can't wait.
I did a movie theater,

3436
02:34:24,110 --> 02:34:25,830
like the first time I ever did 
Washington dc.

3437
02:34:25,840 --> 02:34:27,790
They used to have that.
They'd have standup comedy and then they

3438
02:34:27,791 --> 02:34:29,500
will have a movie after the comedy.
Oh,

3439
02:34:29,501 --> 02:34:30,460
that's cool.
Yeah,

3440
02:34:30,590 --> 02:34:31,630
it was a good gig,
man.

3441
02:34:31,631 --> 02:34:33,430
It was fun.
I don't remember the name of it.

3442
02:34:33,830 --> 02:34:34,930
Um,
so anyway,

3443
02:34:35,080 --> 02:34:40,080
duncan trussell be with me this friday 
night at the chicago theater is almost 

3444
02:34:40,080 --> 02:34:40,770
sold out.
There's only a,

3445
02:34:40,820 --> 02:34:43,120
I think there's less than 200 tickets 
left.

3446
02:34:43,460 --> 02:34:44,950
So most tickets I've ever sold for 
anything.

3447
02:34:44,951 --> 02:34:46,090
It's just crazy.
It's going nuts.

3448
02:34:46,240 --> 02:34:48,960
We have to have big giant screens.
We have to,

3449
02:34:48,961 --> 02:34:53,961
uh,
they have to turn on these big giant 

3450
02:34:53,961 --> 02:34:53,961
screens to watch it.
This place is huge.

3451
02:34:53,961 --> 02:34:53,961
It's an enormous,
awesome place.

3452
02:34:54,130 --> 02:34:55,780
But um,
so that'll be this weekend,

3453
02:34:55,781 --> 02:34:56,200
this friday.

3454
02:34:56,200 --> 02:34:58,420
And then next friday we're doing the 
house of blues.

3455
02:34:58,421 --> 02:35:00,730
Same pictures,

3456
02:35:01,030 --> 02:35:02,740
Joey diaz,

messages and all the cool shit.

3460
02:35:14,770 --> 02:35:19,770
You know,
the the cool people outnumber the cons 

3461
02:35:19,770 --> 02:35:22,431
by a staggering amount.
There's so many more cool people out 

3462
02:35:22,431 --> 02:35:24,400
there that I'm connecting with because 
of twitter,

3463
02:35:24,490 --> 02:35:26,890
because of facebook,
because of this podcast,

3464
02:35:26,891 --> 02:35:31,891
because of the internet.
There's so many more cool people out 

3465
02:35:31,891 --> 02:35:33,460
there than anybody imagines.
just got to find each other.

3466
02:35:33,970 --> 02:35:36,640
And so we're glad you found this.
We connect,

3467
02:35:37,210 --> 02:35:38,860
we stay together.
We grow.

3468
02:35:39,700 --> 02:35:42,640
Party on party on thanks to the 
flashlight,

3469
02:35:43,090 --> 02:35:45,520
go to joe rogan.net.
Click on the link for the flashlight,

3470
02:35:45,820 --> 02:35:46,990

and you will get 15 percent off.

3472
02:35:49,240 --> 02:35:50,280
Number one,
sex toys for men.

3473
02:35:50,290 --> 02:35:51,400
Eventually they,
I,

3474
02:35:51,480 --> 02:35:56,480
I guarantee you,
I predict there'll be sponsoring the 

3475
02:35:56,480 --> 02:35:58,170
death squad as well.
Moving up in the world that's got it.

3476
02:35:58,171 --> 02:35:59,890
Needs a logo.
You need a sponsor like the,

3477
02:36:00,040 --> 02:36:01,060
you get to talk to them.
We're gonna.

3478
02:36:01,061 --> 02:36:03,100
Make this happen.
It's perfect fit.

3479
02:36:03,101 --> 02:36:05,290
You guys have porn stars on with their 
own flashlights,

3480
02:36:05,650 --> 02:36:06,760
you know,
just make sense.

3481
02:36:06,920 --> 02:36:08,040
You know,
they,

3482
02:36:08,110 --> 02:36:09,970
they,
they have a design flashlight.

3483
02:36:10,280 --> 02:36:14,030
I have seven now.
That's like so much pocket.

3484
02:36:14,040 --> 02:36:17,050
Had a lot of podcasts.
The desk wide is free on itunes and it's

3485
02:36:17,051 --> 02:36:18,970
the only place to get the ice house 
chronicles,

3486
02:36:19,180 --> 02:36:22,420
which is a podcast that we do live from 
the ice house.

3487
02:36:22,480 --> 02:36:27,480
Seriously,
it is to me the coolest fucking thing 

3488
02:36:27,480 --> 02:36:27,480
that we do.
It's so fun.

3489
02:36:27,480 --> 02:36:27,890
We,
it's.

3490
02:36:27,891 --> 02:36:32,891
We have a great time every week.
The last week we had dane cook on bert 

3491
02:36:32,891 --> 02:36:32,891
kreischer.

3492
02:36:32,891 --> 02:36:34,540
Red should fear me.
Kevin christie,

3495
02:36:38,110 --> 02:36:43,110
you know what it is.
We have a room at the ice house and so 

3496
02:36:43,110 --> 02:36:44,260
we have this standup show that's totally
sold out.

3497
02:36:44,261 --> 02:36:45,970
Packed little tiny,
intimate,

3498
02:36:45,971 --> 02:36:50,971
awesome room and then the comics are 
rotating and going on stage from the 

3499
02:36:50,971 --> 02:36:54,580
podcast and it's amazing.
It's the most fun and the most,

3500
02:36:54,790 --> 02:36:59,790
the closest you can get to like hanging 
with a bunch of best friends in the 

3501
02:36:59,790 --> 02:37:01,780
green room before we go up there and 
fuck shit up.

3502
02:37:01,940 --> 02:37:03,520
It's like the greatest podcast of all 
time.

3503
02:37:03,521 --> 02:37:08,521
I love the ice house chronicles.

02:37:26,360 --> 02:37:28,170
We do one free one a week.
You can't get mad.

3514
02:37:28,171 --> 02:37:33,171
People get mad at hIm.
How dare you ask me for anything I've 

3515
02:37:33,171 --> 02:37:33,171
given you free stuff you don't have to 
take.

3516
02:37:33,171 --> 02:37:34,170
It's not like I'm saying you want

3517
02:37:34,870 --> 02:37:36,700
to pay,
you don't have to pay.

3518
02:37:36,701 --> 02:37:38,680
You do whatever you want to,
but if you want to,

3519
02:37:38,710 --> 02:37:42,100
there's the possibility.
I am talking for everybody asking.

3520
02:37:42,101 --> 02:37:47,101
I am talking with people about doing the
same thing that louis ck did.

3521
02:37:47,261 --> 02:37:52,261
I'm totally going to steal his idea and 
try to put up my next special just 

3522
02:37:52,261 --> 02:37:52,870
online like that just seems to make 
sense.

3523
02:37:53,040 --> 02:37:54,880
You know,
now that everybody has a Itunes,

3524
02:37:54,881 --> 02:37:59,881
so many people have apple tv.
So many people have netflix and there's 

3525
02:37:59,881 --> 02:38:03,150
so much.
I get more messages about my streaming 

3526
02:38:03,150 --> 02:38:05,881
special from like 2005 on netflix.
I get more email about that particular 

3527
02:38:06,401 --> 02:38:11,401
special than anything I've ever done 
ever because I think more people are 

3528
02:38:11,401 --> 02:38:11,401
seeing it through netflix.
you know,

3529
02:38:11,401 --> 02:38:12,220
like the,
the.

3530
02:38:12,250 --> 02:38:14,560
I don't know if they can get the last 
one,

3531
02:38:14,561 --> 02:38:17,950
the talking monkey's in space,
but the netflix one they made,

3532
02:38:18,140 --> 02:38:23,140
they produced it.
So I get every day I get tweets about 

3533
02:38:23,140 --> 02:38:23,140
that man.
That's the future.

3534
02:38:23,140 --> 02:38:24,700
The future Is louis ck showed us the 
way.

3535
02:38:24,910 --> 02:38:29,910
So I'm going to.
I'm going to totally do what he did and 

3536
02:38:29,910 --> 02:38:30,550
really sit that way and buying my book.
You've got a book?

3537
02:38:30,910 --> 02:38:31,780

3538

02:38:39,400 --> 02:38:40,360

but the world's filled with cunts.

3551
02:39:02,330 --> 02:39:05,410

3552
02:39:05,411 --> 02:39:09,400
and probably made $30,000,000
if he would have done that in one,

3553
