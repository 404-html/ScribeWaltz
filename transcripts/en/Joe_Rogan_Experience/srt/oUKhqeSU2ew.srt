1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,690
Free. You can't hold that pussy over my
head because I don't eat it right now.

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:05,880
I'm good.
Now I see someone annoying.

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,010
I see someone and knowing that
I don't want to be around,

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:09,570
that's pretty good for debts.
Why?

5
00:00:09,571 --> 00:00:12,780
Because you don't like weight
watchers has a model, right?

6
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:16,800
If you're not hungry enough for an
apple, you a fucking hungry. Right.

7
00:00:16,801 --> 00:00:18,360
Which just makes all
the sense in the real,

8
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:20,550
you're not hungry enough for an apple.
You Ain't fucking hungry.

9
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,780
That's a weird model. Okay. They use
the word fucking in that motto. No,

10
00:00:24,781 --> 00:00:26,340
I just dropped it in there for effect.

11
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,670
But it's funny like they should
have a model for, if you,

12
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:33,810
if you still want to go fucking crack
coal and get blow after you've walked off,

13
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:34,963
then go.

14
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,490
I don't think you'll find the energy
once you wipe off and cut your legs right

15
00:00:38,491 --> 00:00:41,010
off. If you sit there for tech,
like if you come to me and go, God,

16
00:00:41,011 --> 00:00:44,180
I need $300 I'm gonna go kill a
crack call and get some coke. Right.

17
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,550
What would a heavyweight
title fight look like if like,

18
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:52,560
like say if you watch a boxing match and
then halfway into the boxing match, uh,

19
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,000
there was like a three.

20
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,840
Like at the third round there's a break
and some hot chick comes in and blows a

21
00:00:57,841 --> 00:01:00,900
dude and then after he shoots is not,

22
00:01:00,901 --> 00:01:02,790
he's got to go out and
fight the next three rounds.

23
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:06,510
It would be interesting to watch,

24
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,980
you know like how many dudes
fought well after they ejaculate

25
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,480
and how many dudes just
completely fell apart.

26
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:17,230
Just turtle up cause that takes the
fucking Fiat. That's what, as you say,

27
00:01:17,231 --> 00:01:18,400
women weaken legs,

28
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:19,291
women weekend,

29
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:24,291
legs rack while they s they say
that when you do it for seven days,

30
00:01:24,841 --> 00:01:26,730
when you're abstained from ejaculation,

31
00:01:26,731 --> 00:01:29,130
by seven days your testosterone can go up.

32
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:34,490
I think it's as high as
50% but it normalizes after
that and then there's like,

33
00:01:34,831 --> 00:01:37,770
well this loser just doesn't get any
pussy. Let's just stop making loads.

34
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:41,070
And then your body stops making as
many loads. Like apparently your,

35
00:01:41,071 --> 00:01:44,250
your body can consistently makes
loads as long as you're using them.

36
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:49,340
That's the idea behind it. They
keep popping. You keep fucking help.

37
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:50,383
Yeah.

38
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:54,500
Anyway, the Joe Rogan experience
podcast is brought to you by,

39
00:01:54,501 --> 00:01:58,370
I think we covered the fleshlight. Yeah,
yeah. I think some questions are awesome.

40
00:01:58,371 --> 00:02:02,870
Fuck yeah, go fuck those. I'm on
it. It makers of Alpha, brain waves,

41
00:02:02,871 --> 00:02:05,900
Alpha brain.
It's a nootropic vitamins for your noggin.

42
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,670
It's essentially a bunch of,
uh,

43
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:14,100
like select herbs and vitamins that
have been known to enhance cognitive

44
00:02:14,151 --> 00:02:16,700
function. It's a very controversial
subject. I believe in it.

45
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,300
I've been taking these long before
we ever endorsed Alpha brain.

46
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,560
I took a bunch of stuff and, Oh, I've
been in contact with Mr Romanowski.

47
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,330
Bill Romanowski you through,
through Twitter.

48
00:02:26,331 --> 00:02:28,740
He's the guy that invented
neuro one and he's a,

49
00:02:28,741 --> 00:02:33,170
a famous football player and that's how
I got into nootropics is, is neuro one.

50
00:02:33,171 --> 00:02:34,320
If you're a,
you know,

51
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:37,970
if you're at a store and you ever see
that it's an awesome blend that he put

52
00:02:37,971 --> 00:02:42,200
together.
Alpha brain is that it's all very similar.

53
00:02:42,201 --> 00:02:47,201
It's all designed to stimulate your
brain's production of neurotransmitters.

54
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,250
And it just, uh, it makes you,

55
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,340
it makes me feel like I can
put sentences together better.

56
00:02:52,341 --> 00:02:56,510
I feel like a little bit smoother. You
know, it's nothing, it's not going to,

57
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:00,100
it's not like limitless. It's not going
to turn you into a, if you're a moron,

58
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:00,970
but,
uh,

59
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:05,140
it does work and there's 100% money
back guarantee for the first 30 pills.

00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:07,600

62
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:15,540

to not rip anybody off and sell really

63
00:03:16,121 --> 00:03:21,121
high quality stuff that I believe in is
a shroom tech sport is the one that I

64
00:03:21,251 --> 00:03:24,040
talk about that I take every
time I work out. It's the shit.

65
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:28,180
It gives you tremendous energy. It's all
vitamin B 12 and cordyceps mushrooms.

66
00:03:28,181 --> 00:03:30,280
It's fucking,
it's one of my favorite things ever.

67
00:03:30,281 --> 00:03:34,090
Like supplements for like a preworkout,
the shroom tech immune.

68
00:03:34,091 --> 00:03:38,350
And then there's five HTP enhanced,
uh, with uh, El Tryptofan.

69
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:43,120
It's called new mood. All the stuff's

10%. All Right Ladies and gentlemen,

73
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:56,340
the official beginning now.

74
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:00,030
Well thanks to see two oh
coconut water for hooking us up.

75
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:17,530
Dude, I drank something to dish
water coconut water yesterday.

76
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:21,940
I found there's a big difference in
coconut waters. You know, we had, we,

77
00:04:21,941 --> 00:04:26,510
we found this out with a c two o the
company, uh, those guys came to uh,

78
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:30,640
to visit us at [inaudible] when we're
at the Improv and they said the Thai

79
00:04:30,641 --> 00:04:33,040
coconuts or what you want,
that's like a short tree.

80
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:34,780
It's only like a five foot
tree or something like that.

81
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:38,650
And it's not like what we think of
these giant palm trees with coconuts.

82
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:42,630
It's not like that. It's a shorter
tree and it's like a sweeter coconut.

83
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:46,090
But all those cans go fucking Savoie
anyway that they all go south.

84
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,720
They will go fucking solid sema seal too.
I got them at the house,

85
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:52,090
so come to blow that smoke
up somebody's else's ass.

86
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:54,940
That's why I finally tapped out
and I go to a little Mexican.

87
00:04:54,941 --> 00:04:57,840
I'm violin and fucking right.
Yeah. They get $4 he give,

88
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:00,970
he gives me the whole fucking coconut.
Oh, right there for the next two to three.

89
00:05:00,971 --> 00:05:03,580
If you do blow,
trim it around like a Margarita with COPD.

90
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:06,910
Stop with those Kansas Shit
because they all go fucking south.

91
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,370
This is a great deal called Dao in la.

92
00:05:09,371 --> 00:05:13,090
It is a great place called pressed juicery
and they deliver them to your house

93
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,370
maybe to deliver fresh,
fresh.

94
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,450
It tastes so much better.
He gave up.

95
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:21,880
It tastes so much better
when it's like right,

96
00:05:21,881 --> 00:05:25,340
fresh and raw like out of the fruit,
but I got a cans,

97
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,480
I got a case from the CEO to and
it's fucking all south sea to

98
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,060
the one before that

99
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:38,710
they were in the refrigerator, drank
it it, I'll put some sugar in it.

100
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:44,330
Coconut goes a little fucking sideways
sometimes you just put a little sugar in

101
00:05:44,331 --> 00:05:47,110
there and you'd open up with
some ice cubes to shake it up.

102
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,180
Sometimes if it's warm up, bro. Trust me,

103
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,340
I was drinking coconut water
when you were in Columbus.

104
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:55,840
Slumped drinking out of a red cat cock
sock that I was going to Puerto Rico on

105
00:05:55,841 --> 00:05:59,030
the fucking seven days when you
could buy the big fucking coconut.

106
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:02,990
There was no tie around. In 1970 there was
no Thai food. There was no ties around,

107
00:06:02,991 --> 00:06:04,340
so knock it off with a tight dress.

108
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:08,420
Ties get here and fucking like 78 I have
to kickbox and I have to kick box on

109
00:06:08,421 --> 00:06:12,380
one. That's when they fucking showed up.
When I got to this country was Chinese.

110
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:16,340
A couple fucking jabs and a couple of
fucking Koreans don't start that shit.

111
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:20,990
The tie came later. Later on, all dark and
shit. Creepy looking, whatever the fuck.

112
00:06:20,991 --> 00:06:24,440
I don't fucking dark skin the,
I don't know what the fuck they are.

113
00:06:24,441 --> 00:06:27,890
I don't know if they have Puerto Rico.
They fucking Chinese ties came along.

114
00:06:27,891 --> 00:06:30,770
The whole porno industry got
tossed on its head. Fuck. Yeah.

115
00:06:30,771 --> 00:06:34,810
Those types of skills for the
ties came around there. I want,

116
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:35,870
and not even ties,

117
00:06:35,871 --> 00:06:40,070
but there's some sort of an Asian
invasion that happened because before that

118
00:06:40,071 --> 00:06:40,731
there was like river.

119
00:06:40,731 --> 00:06:44,300
It was very rarely you see Asian porn
stars now there's like a gang of them.

120
00:06:44,301 --> 00:06:45,050
And I love it.

121
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:49,410
I love to see dirty Asia except those
really like dirtiest one's ever. Yeah.

122
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:52,910
Would you have that one on your podcast
and one of them, one of the podcasts,

123
00:06:52,911 --> 00:06:55,500
was it the naughty show?
Oh,

124
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:59,600
she's Asti beautiful to
look at the one with her.

125
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:03,700
I can't watch those man.
She gets brutalized. Oh,

126
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:07,970
gagged and tied up and face
fucked and know, oh my God,

127
00:07:07,971 --> 00:07:12,350
the thing he can't just do
something happens somewhere
along the line, you know,

128
00:07:12,351 --> 00:07:16,010
and I'm doing the that uh, David
tell show today, Dave's old porn.

129
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,050
I'm doing that right
after I get out of here.

130
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:21,680
Will you sit down like mystery science
theater style and it's in front of an old

131
00:07:21,681 --> 00:07:26,680
porno film and you like mock it and
make fun of it and pick it apart. Um,

132
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:31,100
but those old shot, they were completely
different. You watch like an old porn.

133
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:34,940
It was just people that got together and
then they had sex. You know? It was like,

134
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:37,820
it seems so innocent and complex.
Get down to basics.

135
00:07:37,821 --> 00:07:39,980
You build a fucking horny
cock suck all your life.

136
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:44,000
When was the last time you watched?
What was the first time you watch porn?

137
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:47,090
I want you to explain the
people and how did you watch it?

138
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,480
First Time you discovered point,
break it down for me right now.

139
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:55,790
The first time I discovered video porn,
like a real point, like on cassette.

140
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,840
It was my dad
phs.

141
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,793
Yeah.

142
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:06,050
Well let me tell you how long I fucking
have this government where they used to

143
00:08:06,051 --> 00:08:08,550
come to the house real to real.
Oh my God.

144
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,210
Go for rate 95 you ordered it.

145
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:15,200
I knew somebody had to stay home from
explain reel to reel to reel to reel was

146
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:18,550
you actually,
if you ordered $22 worth a point,

147
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,270
each point real was a dollar 99
cents and this was when porn was just

148
00:08:23,271 --> 00:08:24,104
disgusting.

149
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:28,490
When it was just to the point where after
that either you became a freak or you

150
00:08:28,491 --> 00:08:30,590
fucking said, I don't even want to
see that again. That's what happened.

151
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:34,820
So what happened was for $19
not even guys, I'm exaggerating,

152
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:39,460
but 1295 you got three movies and a
mini projector. Brian in the mail,

153
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:44,630
he projected projected in
the mail. I remember it. So
you had a fucking stay home.

154
00:08:44,631 --> 00:08:48,530
When is right next to the ad for,
do you get some kick sand in your face?

155
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:51,690
Do you remember that ad when the
kickstand, you went home, you said Joe,

156
00:08:51,691 --> 00:08:55,820
we did $3 and we sent you the whole muscle
building shut. You're not the weights,

157
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:56,010
but he

158
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:57,780
also sent you a trophy.
You know one of those trophies?

159
00:08:57,781 --> 00:09:01,440
I had 92 of them instead of the door
push up, you know what I'm saying?

160
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:04,530
And I do a pushup.
I just kept ordering Joe Weeder.

161
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:08,170
So you had a fucking put the
reel. The reel, correct? Yeah.

162
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,760
Tape it to the thing like
you were the fucking,

163
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:12,120
you had to do everything in those days.

164
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:17,320
You had, you had a splicer
he had, it was crazy.

165
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:19,590
It would fuck it.
You had to pull a sheet on

166
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,850
wall and hope that nobody came home until
you got the sheet off the fucking wall

167
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,190
for me.
Like my buddy's brought it over.

168
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:29,040
We put the sheet in the attic
and we all got together.

169
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,770
We smoked like a joint
between seven of us.

170
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:34,180
And we were all excited to
see this point in Austin.

171
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:40,570
And it starts like ten nine eight and
they showed this chick taking a piece of

172
00:09:41,191 --> 00:09:44,150
bread, putting the guy's cock.
And this was way before crap.

173
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:47,250
I don't know what the fuck they were
doing to make these chicks do this shit.

174
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:51,510
the 70s it wasn't heroin because he
was awake. She put a piece of bread,

175
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,140
the guy's Dick on the piece of bread,
put Miracle Whip.

176
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,010
I'll never forget that memory.

177
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:59,390
And it wasn't even one of the bread is
that square fucking redneck be like in

178
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,610
county jail and the bitch bullet.
And she bit into the guys,

179
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:07,710
me and my five little sixth grade
friends looked at each other.

180
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:10,230
And that was the end of the fucking,
I dunno if we came in,

181
00:10:10,231 --> 00:10:14,010
our parents thought we would just modify.
We never watched another point again.

182
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:16,350
That was the end for me.
But when the film broke,

183
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,310
I remember you got to stop correct Ryan.
Yeah.

184
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:22,070
You had a stop work whacking
off and put the film back.

185
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:23,940
Yeah.
And it sucked because it wasn't like,

186
00:10:23,941 --> 00:10:25,590
it was just like put
the two pieces together.

187
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:28,740
You had the first like trim and
cut like a perfect like kite.

188
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:31,110
Then you had to put it in the
splicer and get those in your,

189
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:34,380
you got a boner and you're sitting
there rubbing into the tall white.

190
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:38,040
It was horrible. Porn was
tough. We had to work for it.

191
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:43,041
That's why you had a work sheet when they
would have stag films that they would

192
00:10:43,411 --> 00:10:47,400
show at bachelor parties,
bachelor parties.

193
00:10:47,401 --> 00:10:49,350
They would show stag films,

194
00:10:49,351 --> 00:10:53,670
like guys would get together and they
would show films of people fucking,

195
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:55,620
and they would call them stag films,

196
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:58,440
but it was just porn porn is nothing
different. That's what they called it.

197
00:10:58,441 --> 00:11:01,760
They called them stag films and they
would, uh, they would show them at,

198
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:05,280
at stag parties. Wow.
Yeah. How gross of that.

199
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,610
Then I went to a theater
in Jersey like one day.

200
00:11:09,611 --> 00:11:13,030
My friends like Sunday nights to do
this shit up in jersey, dirty movies.

201
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,410
And you sit in the theater and watch
it with other people that God was the

202
00:11:17,411 --> 00:11:21,080
lowest point, but it's not even low cause
you don't know. You're 16, you fend your,

203
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:26,030
let's go have a few beers. It's not
gross to you go to the bathroom. Oh,

204
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:26,910
the pissing the urine.

205
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:29,860
And some guy just happens to
pop out of the stall number two.

206
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:33,670
And he just stands next to you. Like
he's looking for flowers. Oh God.

207
00:11:33,671 --> 00:11:34,990
You fucking shake your deck.

208
00:11:34,991 --> 00:11:38,440
He staring at your day and
then you go back to your seat.

209
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,980
You could tell your friends.
When I went to the bathroom,

210
00:11:40,981 --> 00:11:43,880
there was some perverted that you go
back to the bathroom and I like that you

211
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:45,640
take it again.
Boom.

212
00:11:45,641 --> 00:11:48,580
He bumps out of the stall number two
and he's sitting next to you. Look,

213
00:11:48,581 --> 00:11:51,910
I mean it would be so fucking creepy.
The whole lifestyle that's,

214
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:54,010
there's a lot of dudes that had ended it.
What

215
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:57,940
is it about sexuality that's so creepy?
Is it because it's so repressed,

216
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:01,670
but what is it about like that
one desire and so it's, it's,

217
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,490
it's so like gross. It's, you know, it's,

218
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:09,880
it's so undesirable. The idea
sexuality, like the idea of a,

219
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,850
you sit in, in a, in a real
like that's a part of sexuality.

220
00:12:12,851 --> 00:12:17,410
You sitting in a room like beaten off
to videos of people fucking like a bunch

221
00:12:17,411 --> 00:12:18,840
of other people in the room too.
And they're all like,

222
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:25,150
like looking up all together. Like
what the fuck? Why is that so creepy?

223
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:28,120
I don't know. But it is, you know,
for everyone was in there eating,

224
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,990
fulfilling that desire. There's no
issue. There's nothing creepy about it.

225
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,910
It'd be in a room and a bunch of people,

226
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:36,610
everybody is eating a sandwich
and there's no problems. You know,

227
00:12:36,611 --> 00:12:39,600
we're all filling that desire. No issue.
I'll go back through it. But he got it.

228
00:12:39,601 --> 00:12:44,470
But a sexuality issue, you know, like
it's very private and very creepy. And me,

229
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,670
even though everybody does it,

230
00:12:45,671 --> 00:12:49,240
it's kind of mysterious so of be like
to sit in some room full of a bunch of

231
00:12:49,241 --> 00:12:52,630
people and everyone's just openly like
sort of admitting that we beat off and

232
00:12:52,631 --> 00:12:56,070
I'll sit in there together. Oh No.
Beating off in front of somebody else.

233
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,340
They're all doing man.

234
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:01,270
That's what they're doing with those
when they go to those theaters.

235
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:06,850
Not like just watching the film and
critiquing it. Wow. Her ass is huge.

236
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:10,060
How does she get all those Dixon,
the movie theater. A lot of it.

237
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,750
That's how peewee Herman got arrested
member, which is hilarious man.

238
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:17,370
How the fuck do you get arrested for
beating off at one of those fuck theaters?

239
00:13:17,371 --> 00:13:19,090
Like isn't that what they,
you're supposed to do?

240
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,980
Aren't you supposed to beat off there?
No,

241
00:13:20,981 --> 00:13:23,800
I don't think you're supposed to be
it off. I think you have like private,

242
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:27,640
I mean private rooms I could whack off
rooms like in bookstores are different.

243
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:29,750
The whole thing's ridiculous. You
know what's going on, you know,

244
00:13:29,751 --> 00:13:32,330
do what you were showing people
blowing people and you're,

245
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,050
you're getting upset because
I'm a beats off with the crowd.

246
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:36,220
Look at your product.

247
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:41,130
What was the name of that club
where people went and paid money?

248
00:13:41,131 --> 00:13:45,780
So Cyrus retreat, Devil's retreat.
Something's retreat. Plato's retreat.

249
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,610
Plato's Plato's retreat.
And what was that?

250
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:51,390
He was a sex club in the 70s and early
eighties where you paid, you know,

251
00:13:51,391 --> 00:13:55,970
1000 bucks the door and you went and then
you fucked 85,000 fucking people play

252
00:13:55,971 --> 00:13:59,730
those retreat thinking. You know, the
thing that always got me about sex that,

253
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,280
you know,
I've been addicted to drugs,

254
00:14:02,281 --> 00:14:06,920
so I understand the addiction is when I
would get off the bus on 48th street and

255
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:07,770
it's,
you know,

256
00:14:07,771 --> 00:14:12,330
seven 45 to go to work selling cars and
I would come home and roll the joint.

257
00:14:12,331 --> 00:14:14,250
I would smoke it right down 42nd street.

258
00:14:14,251 --> 00:14:17,610
I would just sit there and
watch that guys like you and I,

259
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:20,040
but guys that had families,

260
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:24,210
guys with suits on and tie that before
they have to go on with their day.

261
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:28,680
They would have to go into a peep show
and you know who I would see a lot of and

262
00:14:28,681 --> 00:14:32,520
I'm not hitting to talk to me about,
he'd see a lot of Hasidic Jews. Really.

263
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:35,540
A lot of seeds would fucking run
in there with that black honor,

264
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:39,540
that whack walk with the laugh factory
is today with the laugh factory was in

265
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:42,900
Manhattan. That was originally a
strip club on that whole corner.

266
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,840
That was strip club fucking world.
Not even a strip club.

267
00:14:45,841 --> 00:14:49,740
Beat shows where people fucking in a
circle and all that stuff. But I'm in,

268
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:53,330
I would sit outside of, you know,
because you have to cross that street.

269
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,180
That would just sit there
and watch people and go.

270
00:14:56,181 --> 00:14:59,900
What would make somebody jump
out of a tree that was that.

271
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:02,360
You could see them like I
used to leave the store.

272
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:06,110
They have to go get a half gram a club
card. There's nothing else on your mind.

273
00:15:06,111 --> 00:15:06,944
But that coat,

274
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:12,170
I would see them walking off walking
outside eight avenue fucking walking left

275
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,560
and you could see their body language.
They weren't going to stop.

276
00:15:15,561 --> 00:15:19,580
The [inaudible] got to a fuck show to
see some guy fucking big flat black chick

277
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,410
in the middle of a room and you know,

278
00:15:21,411 --> 00:15:23,600
some chickens up to you with
a tent and you could suck it.

279
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,500
It has a family that lives in the suburbs,
you know,

280
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:31,220
from Jersey and cleans or
that's what always fucked me up.

281
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,250
Like that's their fucking freak.
That's their freak.

282
00:15:34,251 --> 00:15:37,430
My freak was doing two bumps and walk
it off though. Four in the morning,

283
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:42,650
there's was going right off the bus at
six in the fucking morning to see two

284
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:44,060
people fucking okay.

285
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:47,690
I remember a first time
I ever bought porn, uh,

286
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:51,320
you had to go to an adult bookstore
if you wanted to buy videos,

287
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:53,240
cause like you could go to some,

288
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:55,760
some video stores like
blockbuster wouldn't carry them,

289
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,150
but some like mom and pop video
stores. And then, you know,

290
00:15:59,151 --> 00:16:03,380
of course you'd have to go through
like saloon doors you didn't have to do

291
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:07,710
or you go through like beads.
But um,

292
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:12,410
I had one time I went to an
actual porn store to buy it.

293
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:17,390
And I remember thinking like really
clearly thinking and don't fucking look at

294
00:16:17,391 --> 00:16:20,360
anybody. Just get through this. Go,

295
00:16:20,361 --> 00:16:23,240
go find what you need and
get the fuck out of here.

296
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:26,720
We're not here for small talk. Like I'm
not one of these people. I just need some,

297
00:16:26,721 --> 00:16:28,760
but I don't want to be like,
and then I started thinking about it like,

298
00:16:28,761 --> 00:16:29,960
who are one of these people?

299
00:16:29,961 --> 00:16:33,380
Like you think about people that
visit porn shop to go, you know,

300
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,420
I don't want to hang out
with any of those people.

301
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,490
People that go to visit porn shops,
but wait a minute,

302
00:16:37,491 --> 00:16:41,660
but I visited a porn shop like,
whooo. Why? Why is it so creepy?

303
00:16:41,661 --> 00:16:46,460
But I don't know. But the instinct like
automatically is that it is, you know,

304
00:16:46,461 --> 00:16:50,510
taking care of your sexuality, especially
yourself, it seems like such a selfish,

305
00:16:50,511 --> 00:16:55,220
creepy, or harass like thing to do.
You're sitting there watching videos,

306
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:01,490
no drama, no drama, no
drama. You're whacking,

307
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:04,170
or maybe some people are
disillusioned from the world.

308
00:17:04,171 --> 00:17:07,560
Maybe they just want to tap out for a
while and going home and putting a wig on

309
00:17:07,561 --> 00:17:10,440
and jerking off his fucking
what they're into. You know,

310
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,000
that's the beauty of what we do.

311
00:17:12,001 --> 00:17:13,800
That everybody's into
something fucking different.

312
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:17,400
I understand somebody going to a,
to a porn store or every

313
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:21,750
day because I go to the weed store every
day. So what's the fucking difference?

314
00:17:21,751 --> 00:17:25,100
Corals correlation thing.
To me,

315
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:30,180
the point thing to me is fascinating
because um, like porn girls,

316
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:35,300
like there's like a huge number of huge
percentage of them who have had a bad

317
00:17:36,211 --> 00:17:39,630
things happen to them when they're kids.
You know,

318
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:42,900
a lot of traumatic like sexual
type shit and it's not all of them,

319
00:17:42,901 --> 00:17:45,930
but it's a lot of them. And so you
get to look at and go, this is crazy.

320
00:17:45,931 --> 00:17:50,100
Like this is a whole industry that was in

321
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,770
many ways because of abuse.

322
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:55,830
And then that industry is,

323
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:58,580
is something that feeds,
you know,

324
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:02,370
through these online videos while he's
over millions and billions at people.

325
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:06,330
But we're all supposed to like
feel bad about it. It's all,

326
00:18:06,331 --> 00:18:11,100
it's a weird sort of
undercover creepy thing.

327
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:11,461
You know,

328
00:18:11,461 --> 00:18:14,760
you couldn't go into business meetings
and talk about your favorite porn sites.

329
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,850
You know, you can't just go there
and like, what are you guys doing?

330
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:19,830
You still going to youporn you
fucking noobs you know, hey come on,

331
00:18:19,831 --> 00:18:24,360
you got to check out, you know, x, Y,
z up your ass videos.com or you know,

332
00:18:24,361 --> 00:18:27,510
all Asians or whatever the
fuck WWE website it is.

333
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:31,260
There's like 100,000 like
free porn websites online.

334
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:35,010
But you can't talk about him. Everybody
goes to work and they just kind of, yeah,

335
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,650
if you brought it up you
could get in trouble.

336
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:41,550
Like if you shared that information with
someone that you work with, you know,

337
00:18:41,551 --> 00:18:43,880
if like go like, wait, what
sites do you go to? Oh, you know,

338
00:18:43,881 --> 00:18:48,710
I'm mostly like a fashion and
babies sides and well, what's,

339
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:49,980
what sites do you go to?

340
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:54,700
Have you been, have you been, he fucked,
I think it's called [inaudible]. It's e.

341
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:59,130
F. U. C. K. T. What is it? It's,

342
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,740
it's just like fucked up porn videos.
You know,

343
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:06,450
it's kind of like old style project, but
that kind of field. But like, you know,

344
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,650
the first one is,
uh,

345
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:12,460
this girl who's 18 has a whole hand in
her vagina and getting fucked in the ass

346
00:19:12,461 --> 00:19:16,810
at the same time. If you just look at
the front page and all the crazy videos.

347
00:19:16,811 --> 00:19:19,960
But anyways,
that's my new favorite porn shit.

348
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:24,580
It's just the abuse porn is very strange.

349
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:28,660
And so what I was saying about watching
like porn from like the 70s and the 80s,

350
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:30,970
they just had sex.
That's all they did.

351
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,540
I mean they got together and then
they had sex like porn of today.

352
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:38,500
It's like there's some really nutty
things they're doing, man. You know,

353
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:42,730
this little bottle like choking
and gagging and you know,

354
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:46,770
it's fucking spitting on each other,
spitting in mouth and

355
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:50,310
stuff. When we were in Ohio, me
and Jodie is wearing in Ohio.

356
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:54,120
I was over at my friend Shane's house
cause he had a baby and she was showing me

357
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:57,670
like he got the playboy of the
month and year that he, uh,

358
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:00,090
was born like that the issue,

359
00:20:00,091 --> 00:20:04,410
which was like in 1974 and there
was this person on there that uh,

360
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:09,030
the, the, the centerfold was
the most beautiful woman ever.

361
00:20:09,031 --> 00:20:13,260
And I'm like obsessed with her now.
Her name is, uh, Maryland Lang. It's m,

362
00:20:13,261 --> 00:20:18,060
a R. I, l. Y. N. Lang, Ellie. And Gee,

363
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:22,980
what are you doing? You Stalker?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Yeah. Right. But, but she,

364
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,920
it was before, you know, implants,
like it was so weird seeing,

365
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:31,190
seeing like playboy that that was always
used to be all natural women curves and

366
00:20:31,261 --> 00:20:35,610
boobs and stuff become like all
bleach blonde, early eighties. Right.

367
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:39,300
Was it early eighties, late
seventies? I don't know. But Lazy.

368
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:41,400
When you look at the evolution of the tip,

369
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:45,540
if you really look at a playboy
from 1969, you'll go, wow,

370
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,070
even the fucking nipples more rounded.
They will

371
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,510
point the uh,
you know,

372
00:20:49,511 --> 00:20:52,840
it's really weird when a woman looks like
we've had this discussion before about

373
00:20:52,841 --> 00:20:54,280
the women of the 70 [inaudible],
you know,

374
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:58,330
that way would the crazy one that Steve
McQueen was married to Ali McGraw,

375
00:20:58,331 --> 00:21:02,340
I shouldn't call it crazy.
It was not for the smack that down set,

376
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,700
but it's just you see those women and
you see the women down. It's, I dunno,

377
00:21:06,701 --> 00:21:08,950
I dunno if there's a
difference. I Dunno. Maybe.

378
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:13,300
Well I think it's more exercise
today and plastic surgery for sure.

379
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,380
And plastic surgery.

380
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:18,490
And so it's weird where like
unnatural looking tits are normal.

381
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:22,690
Like it's really an animal behind you.
She busted the scene.

382
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,250
She really damn anything. Pamela Anderson
really, and everybody in this room says,

383
00:21:27,251 --> 00:21:31,370
yeah, she's gross. But at one time you
did look at this bitch and say she's hot.

384
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,520
She's hot. It was fucking that
picture. No, she's not as fun.

385
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:37,750
It is weird that we're looking at,

386
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:42,040
those aren't really her tits with
those are water bags under the skin.

387
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:44,080
There's a big surgical incision.

388
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:49,320
They stuffed water bags under her skin
and it stretches it out to make like the

389
00:21:49,601 --> 00:21:54,601
nipples extend further and make the whole
thing well unnaturally tight and you

390
00:21:54,611 --> 00:21:58,510
know, and swollen. It's
really kind of fucking crazy.

391
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:02,830
But you could tell humans beings, you
could tell she's got good policy for sure,

392
00:22:02,831 --> 00:22:07,090
but how we'll show wago post how weird
fake tits. They're weird as fuck man.

393
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:12,190
It's a crazy thing. I think that's
a fake nipple or button. No,

394
00:22:12,191 --> 00:22:16,090
that's a button silly Billy that says
place to perfect. Oh, you shut your pie.

395
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:21,250
Yeah. She probably know when it
comes to Paul and I don't really,

396
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:24,370
when I worked in captain video,
I worked at a video store and Aspen,

397
00:22:24,371 --> 00:22:27,780
Colorado for a while and they used
to have like pulling in those days,

398
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:30,430
those sections, they had 12
boxes, you know what I'm saying?

399
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:32,650
Like a video store had to be six releases.

400
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:37,060
One of those releases within Olin sisters
and I brought him home and get coked

401
00:22:37,061 --> 00:22:42,061
out with my girlfriends have in Berlin
and Georgia led the Lynn Lynn [inaudible]

402
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,100
and then the other one was when
that girl was busted onto the scene,

403
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:50,050
the one that was 14 and they let her
find that she was 13 and like I seen her

404
00:22:50,051 --> 00:22:53,260
movies. Which are you talking
about Tracy Lord? Yeah,

405
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:58,270
I think she was 14 she was 18 there's
one video that you can get I think where

406
00:22:58,421 --> 00:23:03,421
she's 18 well she did one called Tracy
does Japan takes a fucking doctor,

407
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:08,740
puts up a fucking pussy. Come on. Mama
Fried. Yes. She was fucking crazy.

408
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:13,570
I don't think you're going to look it
up. I'll look it up. Tracy does Tokyo.

409
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,790
Why wouldn't you?
Don't forget shit like that.

410
00:23:15,791 --> 00:23:20,140
You know I got to find out
about course she was the,

411
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,140
I don't think so because they were all
trying to live up to the led Zeppelin

412
00:23:23,141 --> 00:23:28,030
thing, but Tracy does Seattle.

413
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:31,660
They shoved a shark up some chick's
pussy in Seattle during an orgy dog.

414
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:34,570
Why Little Baby Shark?
He has that ball was the real bill though.

415
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:39,330
Check one of the freaking list and less
freak motherfucker till a couple of

416
00:23:39,331 --> 00:23:43,840
books. Oh Man, I got to see
this. But Tracy did Tokyo.

417
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:45,190
There's an intro.

418
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:50,590
You have to get it. You got to get the
original fucking cut, the whole thing.

419
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:54,800
But Tracy does. Tokyo was when she
went on and that was the last fall.

420
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:58,030
Anything about octopus upper girls.
It's not going to just say,

421
00:23:58,031 --> 00:23:59,500
you know what I'm saying?
It's not going to tell you.

422
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,410
She'd get to this toilet and
she puts it up a wiggles.

423
00:24:02,411 --> 00:24:04,870
And I remember sitting in
that room because I used to,

424
00:24:04,871 --> 00:24:08,050
you know how in those days you always
had a movie on and the video store,

425
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:12,460
I was so crazy. I put a fucking boner and
when people were killing it with kids,

426
00:24:12,461 --> 00:24:16,870
I turn it the fuck off. You know, I was
living in another fucking dimension then.

427
00:24:16,871 --> 00:24:19,600
So I remember pulling an island,
go look at this guys.

428
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:22,960
And I thought it was disgusting. You
know, I wasn't that into that much.

429
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:27,880
All that crazy. And this dog. My
experience is it's Boogie nights.

430
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,320
This movies online,
the parts of it that aren't,

431
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:36,190
aren't sex or online. This is
a wild fucking movie. You know?

432
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,460
I ain't got to drop the bullshit.
No one.

433
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:40,320
Whenever I come in and drop fucked up
knowledge, I don't know nothing about.

434
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:46,110
They know that Tracy Tracy Lourdes was
like 16 and look at those pictures she's

435
00:24:46,451 --> 00:24:49,630
doing just hardcore,
hard fucking core hard.

436
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,220
God,
I got an idea.

437
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:54,640
Let's buy the movie and I'll masturbate
in front of each other to it on the

438
00:24:54,641 --> 00:24:55,200
podcast.

439
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,620
Isn't it crazy that you can say
that there's something wrong,

440
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:02,730
but what she did, there's
something wrong. It's crazy mean.

441
00:25:02,731 --> 00:25:04,620
She obviously knew how to fuck.

442
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,860
She obviously looked like
she should be getting fucked.

443
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:10,650
Right. All of the above. All
the pieces were in place.

444
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:13,710
Would you think that the numbers
get fucked up? I mean, if you,

445
00:25:13,711 --> 00:25:16,810
if she was just a fucking garage, Jamba
juice, you probably wouldn't think that.

446
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:21,710
I think, you know, she obviously
wears a lot of makeup and her video,

447
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:25,350
that was 30 years ago,
those head cuts,

448
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:27,510
if you saw her when she was,
you know,

449
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:31,020
with no makeup at 16 dressed like a
16 year old, you'd probably go, oh,

450
00:25:31,021 --> 00:25:34,730
that's like a young kid. Yeah.
But it's like that little Ramsey.

451
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:38,810
It's a weird thing where it's like what?
What is the right year like?

452
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:39,960
And no one agrees.

453
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:44,250
Like some countries it's like 16 some
parts of the world is 13 some parts of

454
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:46,940
this country, I think it might
be like really young, you know,

455
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:48,810
like whatever the age of consent is.

456
00:25:48,811 --> 00:25:53,500
I think most of them are leaning towards
at least 17 as a, as a parrot. And those,

457
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,990
when you had sex at your age,

458
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:59,040
how old were you when the first time in
a fucking pussy. See what are you ready?

459
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:02,310
Where you really fucking
ready? I'm talking to you
man to man when you're ready.

460
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:05,940
Yeah, I was okay. I mean I handled
it. It wasn't that big a deal.

461
00:26:05,941 --> 00:26:08,280
But I think for kids,
you know,

462
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:11,820
for kids fucking around with
kids there's a different age.

463
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:16,200
You know like you can say the age of
consent is 18 and if the age of consent is

464
00:26:16,201 --> 00:26:18,630
18 that's that,
you know,

465
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,320
that makes sense to me because I mean 17
year olds can still make out with each

466
00:26:22,321 --> 00:26:27,000
other. You know like there should be like
an age buffer where like an 18 year old

467
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:31,770
boyfriend who's been with a girl since
they were 16 and 14 should still be

468
00:26:31,771 --> 00:26:32,670
allowed to banger.

469
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,630
Like once he turns 19 like they'd been
boyfriend and girlfriend for three years.

470
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:37,493
You know what I'm saying?

471
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:40,710
Like why can't they bang anymore just
because he hit some magic number and she

472
00:26:40,711 --> 00:26:44,000
hasn't hit it yet. That doesn't make any
sense to me. Then there is a lot of that.

473
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,980
It's a lot of banging at
14 it was a loud bang.

474
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:51,950
The 14 bang on a 15 [inaudible]
14 I stopped some titties.

475
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:54,150
You know where you ready
for a lot of hand job?

476
00:26:54,151 --> 00:26:55,590
Well you fucking ready for it was that,

477
00:26:55,591 --> 00:26:58,260
you know the girl I was doing all that
shit with. This was kind of a thought.

478
00:26:58,261 --> 00:26:59,550
As I looked at her Facebook page,

479
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:03,510
she wasn't ready to see my Cuba.

480
00:27:03,511 --> 00:27:08,511
I grow it fucking 14 and then then you'd
have to refer to yourself as a parent.

481
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:14,660
What age do I think my son or my
daughter is ready to fuck around?

482
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:18,780
The question is what age can a man fuck
your daughter? That's the real question.

483
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:20,700
That's the real question because it's not,

484
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:24,390
can a 16 year old boy fucking 16 year
old girl? Yeah, of course they can.

485
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:28,440
Can a 17 year old boy fucking
16 year old girl? I guess so.

486
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:32,760
Can an 18 year old boy fuck a 16 year
old girl. Yeah. If she's been sure,

487
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:37,190
can a 19 year old guy fuck a 16 year
old girl know can a 20 year old and then

488
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,980
you know what I'm saying? Or he gets,
it starts getting exponentially.

489
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,490
Who's the judge of that?

490
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:45,940
Somebody in Kentucky probably thinks
it's completely different like it's seven

491
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:50,430
40 yeah. There should be, you
know, some sort of a standard.

492
00:27:50,431 --> 00:27:55,020
But I mean at a certain point in
time I go to just got to let it go.

493
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,430
What are you ready? Look at
your kids around you. You,

494
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:02,430
whenever I meet people that have kids,
I always ask the parents,

495
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:06,510
how old are the kids? What'd
they say to me? He's 14 I go to,

496
00:28:06,511 --> 00:28:07,800
I look at that person.
I go,

497
00:28:07,801 --> 00:28:12,540
look at that kid at that age I was
already doing a thousand things.

498
00:28:12,541 --> 00:28:15,730
What a shame. Cause I wasn't
ready for that. What she, yeah,

499
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:20,330
but you had a wild life.
Doesn't matter. 14.

500
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:24,870
You should not be hanging out with
guys robbing a train, you know? Uh,

501
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:30,090
I would say the cycle of true. How you
should not be doing a lot of things at 14.

502
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:34,160
Yeah, I have the, I stop and think about
some shit that I did not have some apps,

503
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:38,040
a fucking loot. We have 15 I shouldn't
have found somebody on the floor dead.

504
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,660
I shouldn't have done a lot.
You know what I'm saying?

505
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:44,100
I handled a lot at that age. I look at
these kids and like, oh, that's 15 wow.

506
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:47,880
At that age I had already mug somebody
a role, the drunk, I'd done something,

507
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:50,940
you know what I'm saying? It's
something to look over and you go, fuck,

508
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:52,800
either I liked this or I don't,
you know,

509
00:28:52,801 --> 00:28:56,010
a shock like trace blood
do they like or he does it.

510
00:28:56,040 --> 00:29:00,720
I remember hanging out on the street
at night as like a 13 or 14 year old,

511
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:03,960
you know, I remember like we just
be out on the street on the summer.

512
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:07,510
We'd be playing in the street. It'd be
like midnight or something, you know,

513
00:29:07,511 --> 00:29:10,920
and we just be out. No one does
that. No you can't do that.

514
00:29:10,921 --> 00:29:14,790
No cop would pull you over copper to
pull over and go and have a curfew at 10

515
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:17,340
got to be in.
Where's your parents drive you home?

516
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,430
We would just say like,
Hey,

517
00:29:18,431 --> 00:29:21,280
I'm going to spend the night
at my friend's house and
Mri frame and say, yeah,

518
00:29:21,281 --> 00:29:22,980
we're gonna spend the night.
But we had a protest and they,

519
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,690
the parents don't want to fucking talk
to her like little babysitter for the

520
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:27,770
night. We get the fuck out on
the couch. You know you guys were

521
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:33,060
mosquito bites and your Dick, right?
Remember mosquitoes man. Yeah.

522
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,470
Do we don't get that in la?

523
00:29:34,471 --> 00:29:38,790
People don't realize how fucking conti
mosquitoes can be when you go out into

524
00:29:38,791 --> 00:29:41,010
the woods and they just swarm on your ass.

525
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,130
I got bit in the face

526
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:46,690
when I was in Ohio from right here.
Regionally. Yeah. Off don't work no more.

527
00:29:46,691 --> 00:29:50,640
We talked about this shit off that shit.
They power through those mosquitoes.

528
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:53,890
They drink that shift from mouthwash.
He got ahold of some Monsanto corn.

529
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:57,960
They were fucking super pumped up,
dude. My Dad was telling me about that.

530
00:29:58,090 --> 00:30:02,230
This bug that came from Japan
and that's then hit, uh,

531
00:30:02,231 --> 00:30:06,400
I think Canada and then went to Michigan
and now it's coming down to Ohio and

532
00:30:06,401 --> 00:30:11,050
it's going, what it's doing is, is
it's, well, it's not bad for us,

533
00:30:11,051 --> 00:30:15,030
but it goes into these trees. I forget
the name of the tree that like, uh,

534
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:19,330
that it's attacking and it, it, uh,
drills, holes in it and lays eggs in it.

535
00:30:19,331 --> 00:30:20,710
And then when all the babies come out,

536
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:22,780
they just pretty much
destroyed everything.

537
00:30:22,781 --> 00:30:26,650
So it's killing this whole
breeding the tree bark beetle? No,

538
00:30:26,651 --> 00:30:30,340
it's something something I've never heard
of in in and it's just destroying all

539
00:30:30,341 --> 00:30:33,580
the, my dad has had these trees
for 30 years in his backyard.

540
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:35,650
He's humongous trees. They're
all dead. And he's like, dude,

541
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:37,510
they're all the trees in
the neighborhood are dead.

542
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:42,280
Like it's just attacking Ohio right now.
And it when it was in Michigan before,

543
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:45,460
how do they stop it? They can't.
They can to pretreat a tree.

544
00:30:45,461 --> 00:30:47,080
Like you could have these
people come out to your tree,

545
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:50,150
a tree and put this shit in it and they
drill these holes in the tree and put it

546
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:53,440
like this chemical on the tree
that supposedly helps it, but it's,

547
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:54,670
it didn't work for my dad.

548
00:30:54,671 --> 00:30:59,400
And like all that he had all his trees
treated and it's just destroying all

549
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:03,250
these trees. That's insane.
Yeah. That's fucked man.

550
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:08,150
Isn't it weird how like now,
because of all the cross pollination,

551
00:31:08,151 --> 00:31:12,890
which ships and planes and the weekend
introduce shit to a place where it has no

552
00:31:12,891 --> 00:31:17,030
natural predators and that the whole
system just gets completely fucked.

553
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:21,410
I was on the, um, the, not
a, not even the highway.

554
00:31:21,411 --> 00:31:24,560
It was on like a regular streets
last night at about 10 o'clock.

555
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:26,600
And as I'm driving down the street,

556
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:31,870
I saw this fucking coyote standing in
the road staring at me and then he trots

557
00:31:32,121 --> 00:31:36,320
over to the sidewalk and then I slowed
down and I look at him and he's staring

558
00:31:36,321 --> 00:31:38,170
at me and he looks left and it looks like,
and then he runs,

559
00:31:38,171 --> 00:31:39,710
it runs up into someone's driveway.

560
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:43,040
And I'm looking at that kind of
like that mother, if that's reality,

561
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:44,451
that's nature.

562
00:31:44,451 --> 00:31:49,190
That's something that doesn't know traffic
lights doesn't give a fuck about your

563
00:31:49,191 --> 00:31:53,240
laws, doesn't give a fuck about, you know,
the, Oh, that's your kid. Oh, I won't,

564
00:31:53,241 --> 00:31:55,300
I won't fuck with your kid.
You know this,

565
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:59,870
it's a crazy little monster or an
around eating. Cat's eating rabbits,

566
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:04,190
killing things all around people's homes.
And that's, that's, that's reality.

567
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:08,120
That thing's going to be here long after
these buildings rot away and nuclear

568
00:32:08,121 --> 00:32:13,040
waste makes people evacuate, you know,
everything west of Pasadena, you know,

569
00:32:13,041 --> 00:32:16,100
I mean once that actually happens
with things like that actually happen,

570
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,410
there's a gang of code,

571
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,720
there's a gang of coyotes that live in
Burbank and I have this thing where I,

572
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:24,200
I feel weird with coyotes cause I don't
feel like they're going to attack me at

573
00:32:24,201 --> 00:32:25,730
all even though they might sometime.

574
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,100
But I always rolled down the
window and fuck with coyotes.

575
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:30,440
Like I'll whistle and be
like, hey, you know, like,

576
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,240
like do you play with the coyotes

577
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,170
dogs? But you're going to see a picture
of a coyote with her mouth open. Yeah.

578
00:32:37,171 --> 00:32:42,140
It's scary fucking nuts man. They look
like cartoon mouse like their mouths have.

579
00:32:42,141 --> 00:32:46,070
So like take it, pull up a
picture of one coyote mouth open,

580
00:32:46,071 --> 00:32:50,480
big teeth something Google
asshole. Um, but Ho asshole,

581
00:32:50,481 --> 00:32:53,930
whatever you want to
put in the um, um, the,

582
00:32:53,931 --> 00:32:57,750
the extra like extra teeth that they
have are really fucking anything.

583
00:32:57,770 --> 00:32:58,760
Set this picture out.

584
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:05,080
Jesus. We can always
fucking teeth. Look at that.

585
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:08,110
Look in his fucking teeth.
That's so scary.

586
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:14,360
That's really fucked up when you think
about that young girl that got killed by

587
00:33:14,361 --> 00:33:16,460
coyotes.
It's so rare that that happens,

588
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,470
but it can have a little kids
get bitten by them all the time,

589
00:33:19,471 --> 00:33:21,140
but usually little kids
are near their parents.

590
00:33:21,141 --> 00:33:23,650
So usually what happens is
like the dad comes over,

591
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,640
beats the fuck out of the
coyote and the coyote. Let's go.

592
00:33:25,641 --> 00:33:29,630
Like it's happened a few
times, uh, in recent memory,

593
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:34,910
but fucking this chick was just walking
through the woods and a whole gang of

594
00:33:34,911 --> 00:33:37,220
them circled her.

595
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:42,050
I just said we can take her and just
jacked her killed by coyotes. Ooo,

596
00:33:42,051 --> 00:33:42,884
that's gruesome.

597
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:45,580
Yeah. The gang in my neighborhood
just hangs out around my fence.

598
00:33:45,581 --> 00:33:49,510
Like I'll let my dog will come out and
go to the bathroom and you could just

599
00:33:49,511 --> 00:33:50,500
hear like,
like it.

600
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:53,770
My dog started barking and then you just
see all these feet scattering around my

601
00:33:53,771 --> 00:33:56,290
fence. Like, oh, these coyotes
are going to try to attack my,

602
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:58,340
my dog if they can do it.

603
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:01,260
Knowing the coyotes can
attack people like that.

604
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:05,610
I say we kill all of them
when people are like, no,

605
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:10,140
these are our friends. Do you know they
killed a mountain lion in Santa Monica?

606
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:12,690
Do you know about that? I heard
about that. Were you go on Joe Diaz

607
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:16,510
is coyote could eaten
like can you eat a coyote?

608
00:34:16,511 --> 00:34:18,580
Cause what if we can make
it some kind of Coyote Berg?

609
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:21,770
I bet you could eat it if you had
to eat it, but it tastes like shit.

610
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:26,960
I've had it tastes like
hatred. A big coyote meat just
tastes like rotten hatred.

611
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:27,913
Yes.

612
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:33,040
Coyote brain.
That's like crazy

613
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:38,090
Auntie fucking animals.

614
00:34:38,091 --> 00:34:41,380
Kylie's are so they killed this
mountain lions and Sandy and um, uh,

615
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:46,190
Santa Monica and like where everybody
is second Monica populated area.

616
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:48,860
And it wasn't a homeless person.
No. So fucking mountain lion.

617
00:34:48,861 --> 00:34:53,420
It was a real mount line, not a cougar
and not a crazy old bitch. And um,

618
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:54,800
when,
when they killed it,

619
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:57,830
there was all these Facebook posts
and one of them was my favorite.

620
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:01,040
It was so awesome.
There's this woman and she said,

621
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:06,020
why are w w it's only because of our
ego that we think we are better than

622
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:10,100
animals. You know, animals have
a soul and she like, you know,

623
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:11,300
soul in all caps.

624
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:16,480
I would gladly take a bullet for an animal
or a dog or a cat or a bear or a deer

625
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:22,970
before I would for a person.
Exclamation point, exclamation point.

626
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:27,260
I mean, I was, I was looking at this, I'm
like, this is amazing. Like this is a,

627
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:31,490
this is a person that's actually saying
you shouldn't kill that monster that's

628
00:35:31,491 --> 00:35:35,480
roaming through the neighborhood,
the 150 pound cat.

629
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:40,650
Now you shouldn't kill that unpredictable
beast. And if you wanted to do that,

630
00:35:40,651 --> 00:35:42,750
I would gladly take that bullet.

631
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:45,900
I would sacrifice my
life for this monster.

632
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:51,030
You sacrifice your life for one of the
most horrific creations of nature of big

633
00:35:51,031 --> 00:35:51,864
cat

634
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:58,490
mean thoughtless killing machine that
you can't even roll a basketball in front

635
00:36:01,231 --> 00:36:04,620
of one of those things. They fucking dive
on and bite it. That's their instinct.

636
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:08,000
Yeah. But they could have also done
that as a weapon. Just like, Hey,

637
00:36:08,001 --> 00:36:12,260
get away from me cat here to chase
this ball and all this technology.

638
00:36:12,261 --> 00:36:14,510
They can pull one of those bullets and
put them to sleep and take them to the

639
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:19,430
zoo. I figured out what's going on and
kill fucking everything. Yeah, I do.

640
00:36:19,431 --> 00:36:23,980
I do think that kill everything in the
stand up there is as a harmful animal,

641
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:27,160
whatever. But something made
that bed come down that bed.

642
00:36:27,161 --> 00:36:29,230
I'm gonna fucking nobody. We don't
want to fuck with him. Right.

643
00:36:29,231 --> 00:36:30,380
So we did a building somewhere.

644
00:36:30,381 --> 00:36:34,040
They shouldn't be fucking building or
there's no food for the fucking bed.

645
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,020
It's most likely.
No,

646
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:40,200
and it's also the problem with bears and
people is that once they find out that

647
00:36:40,201 --> 00:36:42,360
they can go to garbage cans and get food,
that's it.

648
00:36:42,361 --> 00:36:43,770
They just threw the
garbage cans all the time.

649
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:47,280
Then they have to take them and put them
in zoos and shit. They become, yeah,

650
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:50,100
I understand.
You have to protect the community.

651
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:52,830
We can't have a bear or
a fucking mountain line.

652
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:56,250
Does anybody know what a mountain lion
will do to you? Him being and how fast.

653
00:36:56,790 --> 00:37:00,570
But at the same time. Let's see if
we could fucking mummify him first.

654
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:04,060
Take him to a museum.
Figure out what made this fucking Mama.

655
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,600
She one of those guards
on them that we have.

656
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:09,570
You got something on your list
when we have darts and lasers,

657
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:15,820
laser lasers and dark running under
one o one backwards and he gets shot.

658
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:18,760
Darden. What the fuck?
You got these dark squawk.

659
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:22,470
You got dark officer's Darla laser room.
You talk about them.

660
00:37:22,471 --> 00:37:24,030
You show them the Chuck Norris movie.

661
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:27,740
Now you're on the one on one and you
don't want a dark nobody. You follow me?

662
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:32,070
We're a little bit to Taser and people's
dangerous. We're a little bit too,

663
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,010
we're a little bit too quick to pull
the fucking trigger. I loved the,

664
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:39,150
I loved the fucking, you know, bearing
arms and everything, but it's a bear.

665
00:37:39,151 --> 00:37:40,770
Anybody who knows hunting or whatever,

666
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:43,040
just sit still for two minutes
and get the fuck out of here.

667
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:44,980
Get the fuck out of there.
You,

668
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:49,070
you kicked the garbage can that more
skeletal us until we fucking corner.

669
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:53,520
You know, I, let me just fucking ask
them what they were everywhere they were.

670
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:56,340
You gotta be real careful.
I gotta be real careful with it,

671
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:57,930
but I seen it a lot now.

672
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:03,540
I used to see schools are raccoons schools
and I'm crossing the street from the

673
00:38:03,541 --> 00:38:05,550
big ones,
the little tiny one at the end.

674
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:08,710
I know those motherfuckers are dangerous,
but you can't hit them with a car.

675
00:38:08,711 --> 00:38:09,540
Let them be.

676
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:13,280
I wish I saved a picture. There's
a picture that I saw once, uh,

677
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:16,740
I don't remember if it was online
or in a book or a magazine.

678
00:38:16,741 --> 00:38:20,250
I wish I saved this picture cause I
haven't been able to find it and all my

679
00:38:20,251 --> 00:38:23,190
Google searches.
But it was a guy who was a photographer.

680
00:38:23,191 --> 00:38:27,420
It was killed by a bear and he was
taking pictures of a female and her cubs.

681
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:31,860
And the last image on his camera before
he was killed by the bear is the bear

682
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:36,760
with its teeth glared charging them.
And it's a fucking horrific

683
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:40,570
picture. They found it. They found
it on the dude's camera, but it is,

684
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:43,000
I don't remember looking
at it and thinking back

685
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:48,110
on your business when they shot Jim
Jones and they camera man went down.

686
00:38:48,111 --> 00:38:51,070
I remember the camera kept running as
they was shooting everybody as we got on a

687
00:38:51,071 --> 00:38:54,130
plane from Guyana that was live footage,
the ad on television.

688
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,720
What the fuck were you doing in Guyana?

689
00:38:55,721 --> 00:38:58,060
You should've been taking pictures
of San Francisco where you live.

690
00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:02,170
That Jim Jones story. Remember that
shit? They shot him at the airport.

691
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:07,240
What was the dude's name? Who did, who
played him in the movie powers booth. Ooh.

692
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:13,510
Bad mother fucker for certain things.
Oh my God. He comes out and when,

693
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:17,910
when you need a heavy southern gentlemen
throwing heat and you always booths are

694
00:39:17,911 --> 00:39:18,744
bad.
Motherfucker.

695
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:23,540
Look at the screen here. Is this the, for
some reason the image isn't showing up,

696
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:27,020
but it says the images captures at
bear seconds before it's mod two.

697
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:28,580
It's photonics falls.

698
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:32,480
Well, I think you're thinking
of a different picture though.
The, the, the one, the,

699
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:37,700
they're thinking of one where it's,
I'm a bear comes into a guy's tent.

700
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:41,720
I think that's a different image.
Okay.

701
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,150
What's up Joe Rogan Baby?
Nothing, man. What's going on?

702
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:49,430
See if we could find that you're very
excited about this series and one fake one

703
00:39:49,431 --> 00:39:52,220
though. A fake one where they showed
the photo shop to go with you.

704
00:39:52,221 --> 00:39:55,340
I was going to be, this is a great fucking
card rate card. It's going to be sick.

705
00:39:55,341 --> 00:40:00,230
Just some great college coming up to
the next few fucking weeks to dos Santos

706
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:04,700
and Frank Mir scoby nuts. I was going
to ask you to remember this. Salvia gay,

707
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:10,160
that was the crazy MMA guy
that was always talking about,

708
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:14,700
not Salvia, but Stevia. Stevia. I
know that whole story. Yeah, I dunno.

709
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,960
Probably shouldn't talk about it.
Yeah, don't give him any attention.

710
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:24,050
Something's wrong with them. Maybe it was.
Break it down. I'm very excited for you.

711
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:26,720
Sorry, I can't go. Yeah,
we should it go be fun.

712
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:28,860
I want them.
I watch one with you guys.

713
00:40:28,861 --> 00:40:32,160
We got to go to a strike force car next
time. It was a big strike force fight.

714
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:36,540
Did you see? Yeah. The last one. Did you
see Josh Barnett and Daniel Cormier? Ooh,

715
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:40,920
what a fight. Both guys broke their hands
in the first round to look very good.

716
00:40:40,921 --> 00:40:44,080
It's a beast. He's a
fucking voice. Takes a,

717
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:47,220
launched Josh Barnett into the
air to Josh Barnett is a big boy.

718
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:51,930
He's a big Daniel Cormier. Hoisted him
up and Whoa, boom. Threw him for a ride,

719
00:40:51,931 --> 00:40:55,410
control them on top, smashed him,
cut him up with elbows. He's a,

720
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:59,700
and he's only had like, I think that was
his fifth that, I mean, it's amazing.

721
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:02,970
Tenure Karma is a motherfucker
is out of the baby face assassin.

722
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:07,950
He's been around forever. He was a
old, one of the youngest UFC champs.

723
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:13,050
He won, I don't know how old he was when
he won the title, but I remember he beat,

724
00:41:13,051 --> 00:41:14,490
he beat Randy couture.

725
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:18,030
And then there was some sort of a
dispute with the UFC eve, you know,

726
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:21,150
management and UFC didn't get along.
And he laughed.

727
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:25,050
And then he started fighting overseas
and he fought in pride and you know,

728
00:41:25,051 --> 00:41:29,490
and then he came back and it became
part of the strike force tournament,

729
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:33,760
you know? But he's been around forever
and he's that guy he's fought. He's, yeah,

730
00:41:33,790 --> 00:41:37,810
he's fought. Minotauro is fought
cro cop twice. You know, he's,

731
00:41:37,811 --> 00:41:39,770
he's filed a lot of fucking dudes.

732
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,550
I just thought his experience
would really shine through.

733
00:41:42,551 --> 00:41:46,500
But for call that mother Fucker, man,
well you know though, Josh Barnett, Bro,

734
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:48,760
his hand the first round
and so the core me Yang,

735
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:52,980
they both broke their hand the
first round. So, uh, you know,

736
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:55,110
who knows how a rematch with girl,

737
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:58,680
but call me a won that
fight with his wrestling.

738
00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:02,580
He won that fight with his striking. I
mean, he's just a mother fucker dude.

739
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:06,450
And he's not been doing it that
long and he's, he's bad ass man.

740
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:09,510
I haven't been really praised.
The head kicked Josh Barnett twice.

741
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:12,150
That's what you know. And Josh
Ran, I couldn't take them down.

742
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:15,270
No one's to be able to take them
down in, in a UFC match. I mean,

743
00:42:15,271 --> 00:42:16,800
he's such a high level wrestler.

744
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:21,090
It's going to take a fucking beast
to take that guy down, you know?

745
00:42:21,091 --> 00:42:23,700
And so you got to stand with
him and he's really quick man.

746
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,830
And he's not a tall guy, but he's
like compact and explosive, you know.

747
00:42:28,831 --> 00:42:32,640
And that all the years of wrestling,
that high level wrestling,

748
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:36,750
I think the mental toughness
that those guys gain from

749
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:43,470
high school. Yeah, he was
amateur wrestling's and there's
a different animals, man.

750
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:44,970
Those are different animals there.

751
00:42:44,971 --> 00:42:49,500
Those guys are tough on a whole different
level. They're like, in my opinion,

752
00:42:49,501 --> 00:42:53,610
that maybe the tea all like
in camp, you know, you tell,

753
00:42:53,611 --> 00:42:57,660
you look at just the percentage that might
be the toughest group of human beings

754
00:42:57,661 --> 00:43:02,280
on earth. Just the toughest mentally
toughest is amateur wrestlers.

755
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:06,330
It really might be. They're
fucking animals, man. Those
guys, some of this shit,

756
00:43:06,331 --> 00:43:09,900
those guys go through it and they do a
dehydrated and malnourished and they're,

757
00:43:09,901 --> 00:43:12,170
they're out there like fucking animals.
You know what's crazy though?

758
00:43:12,171 --> 00:43:16,380
You went to the UFC in Jersey and
he has all these MMA fighters.

759
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:17,710
The audience say that,

760
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:22,260
but everybody kept looking at that
Penn state fucking wrestling team and

761
00:43:22,261 --> 00:43:25,770
everybody kept looking at that coach
war people went up to shake that

762
00:43:25,771 --> 00:43:30,210
motherfucker's hand. I heard more
people go small. It is, what's his name?

763
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:34,880
You think coach a Penn state. That's
the best wrestler in the world. Oh,

764
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:38,200
Cael Sanderson, who was at the
fight right in the row behind me.

765
00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:42,900
And he's wrestling again. No.
Yeah. I think if I, I don't
know if it's the same guy,

766
00:43:42,901 --> 00:43:46,680
we're thinking about that. What do they
say is the best wrestler in the world?

767
00:43:46,681 --> 00:43:49,190
Yeah.
He's an amazing I fucking two years guy.

768
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,920
Even not something that you're like, oh,
I'm not going to mess with him. Very,

769
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:57,921
he was sitting behind this with the team
at everybody who walked by had a say,

770
00:43:58,650 --> 00:44:02,550
oh my God, this channel Sanderson
Old Cael Sanderson. Oh my God.

771
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,370
Like everybody was fucking
like in awe of this guy.

772
00:44:05,790 --> 00:44:07,230
And that was when we threw the guy out.

773
00:44:07,231 --> 00:44:10,290
And then the guy that was with him said
to me, Joey Karate, we got your back.

774
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:12,690
That's when it all went down
because the guy was yelling,

775
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:17,310
but everybody was looking at that guy,
like he was a fucking killer that day.

776
00:44:17,610 --> 00:44:21,750
And I mean, from fixed to Guido, everybody
was there standing there, you know?

777
00:44:21,751 --> 00:44:26,250
So yeah. He's the coach at
Penn state. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's Cael Sanderson. Yeah,

778
00:44:26,251 --> 00:44:30,570
he's a beast. It's crazy. His, um,
his, the, the, the people that, uh,

779
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:32,190
he was wrestling with

780
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:35,430
like teaching in college. They're the
ones who encouraged them to compete again,

781
00:44:35,970 --> 00:44:38,250
he's still physically got it.
He just stopped competing.

782
00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:41,010
I just think like that high a level,

783
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,890
like when you're at that
high a level in any sport,

784
00:44:43,891 --> 00:44:48,150
whether it's wrestling or anything, you
know, boxing, when you get to that level,

785
00:44:48,151 --> 00:44:50,670
it's so hard to maintain
that kind of pace.

786
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:54,080
It's so hard to just live your life like
that where you're constantly coming.

787
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:56,240
Painting,
when I was a kid,

788
00:44:56,241 --> 00:44:59,240
I see the high school wrestling or the
way you were fucking voices just creeping

789
00:44:59,241 --> 00:45:02,150
me out with a cause that you or him,
when I was a kid,

790
00:45:02,151 --> 00:45:04,100
I see the most of the best fights ever.

791
00:45:04,101 --> 00:45:08,390
I seen a high school decorated wrestler
fight this kid that was a scrappy

792
00:45:08,391 --> 00:45:13,040
fighter or Billy Lou dog, two minutes and
he got his hooks in this motherfucker.

793
00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:14,990
It was in front of the VFW.

794
00:45:14,991 --> 00:45:17,240
You know how they always have
an American flag with a pole?

795
00:45:17,530 --> 00:45:18,363
There's a little fence.

796
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:22,460
He picked him up and threw them over the
fucking fence dog. Oh No, the strike,

797
00:45:22,461 --> 00:45:24,740
I didn't know. He just landed on
his head. He just took to it like,

798
00:45:24,741 --> 00:45:28,230
what am I going to do? I'm not going to
get back up or fight this fucking month.

799
00:45:28,231 --> 00:45:31,040
So just pick up. And that's when I
was like, restless, got something.

800
00:45:31,041 --> 00:45:34,250
They got that core strength they'd
been working on since they were young.

801
00:45:34,251 --> 00:45:36,230
And some of these guys with
the bent knee isn't shit.

802
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:39,620
They ain't got no time to fuck around man.
They'll take you the fuck down.

803
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:42,320
But it has made a difference in him.
It may that I've seen,

804
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:45,710
I don't know much about it. I, I, you
know, I watched a little bit of pride,

805
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:49,100
but in the UFC you've seen these
wrestlers that makes a big impact.

806
00:45:49,101 --> 00:45:50,510
Judo guys and the wrestler,

807
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,970
that's the, that's the, those are
the two toughest to deal with.

808
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:56,520
But the thing about a, you know,
and both of them, you know,

809
00:45:56,521 --> 00:45:58,380
especially when it comes to
international competition,

810
00:45:58,470 --> 00:46:02,040
they both have to deal with some pretty
fucking stiff and crazy competition,

811
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:07,140
you know. But judo internationally,
especially as you know, really popular,

812
00:46:07,141 --> 00:46:10,260
it's a really popular sport. And a lot
of different countries, but wrestling,

813
00:46:10,770 --> 00:46:12,570
there's something about
wrestlers man, that, that,

814
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:14,280
that what they have to go through,

815
00:46:14,310 --> 00:46:18,120
their mind becomes capable of pulling
shit off that other where other people

816
00:46:18,121 --> 00:46:20,430
wouldn't push hard enough.
They would, they would just,

817
00:46:20,431 --> 00:46:23,940
they would back off before the
wrestler does. You know, these guys,

818
00:46:23,941 --> 00:46:27,930
red line in man, they know how to read
line their brain, their body, you know,

819
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:32,010
some of the most savage fighters of
all time. Dan Henderson, Randy Coture,

820
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:34,800
you know, go through the lineup.
All the, the Matt Hughes,

821
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:38,120
think about all the different guys
that started off Koscheck the,

822
00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:40,020
all the different guys
who started off Hendrick.

823
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:44,430
Yeah. Rashad. Rashad, yeah, absolutely.

824
00:46:44,431 --> 00:46:48,430
The lest of John Fitch was a
captain at Purdue. The list is a,

825
00:46:48,431 --> 00:46:52,200
and it takes a while for the hands
to catch up with everything else.

826
00:46:52,201 --> 00:46:55,580
But some guys picking right up, uh,
Griffin. What's the name of fabulous?

827
00:46:55,581 --> 00:47:00,420
Phil was the one who just fought Rashad
before. Phil Davis. So Davis, I'm sorry.

828
00:47:00,421 --> 00:47:03,550
Yeah, fabulous. Whatever they call him.
Mr. Wonderful. What's the one before fall?

829
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:05,090
It's just,
you know,

830
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:08,190
a lot of evil that he always said that
you better get ready for these wrestlers

831
00:47:08,191 --> 00:47:11,430
and learn how to fight off your back
cause he's rest is gonna fucking take you

832
00:47:11,431 --> 00:47:16,050
down. You know. So there's so
many guys that become successful.

833
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:18,510
If you started with the Japanese
cultural center in Hollywood,

834
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:22,680
no one is close to Eddie's. It's a
couple blocks from the old uh, legends.

835
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:26,520
The one on the Vermont and one that
just moved the culture of some of the,

836
00:47:26,530 --> 00:47:29,560
it's like where the Japanese
go to practice judo in town

837
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:34,090
and it's real dirt cheap. It's
hardwood floors. It's all old school.

838
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:37,870
Some people go sign up one time and get
the fuck out of that cause it's very

839
00:47:37,871 --> 00:47:40,960
traditional and they didn't
really do two classes a week,

840
00:47:40,961 --> 00:47:42,100
but it's going on down there.

841
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:45,820
All these other things like high kido
on labrea with the swords and shit.

842
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:50,821
The gun I'm talking about down on a and
they'd been there since 1940 something.

843
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:54,460
Is there something that Keough
school in Hollywood? No,

844
00:47:54,461 --> 00:47:56,410
they moved to Burbank and
then they moved again.

845
00:47:56,411 --> 00:47:59,650
I drive by on Magnolia and I
seen everything is in Burbank.

846
00:48:00,070 --> 00:48:04,580
Any style that you want is in Burbank
martial arts. I went to see that.

847
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:08,680
He's uh, I went to Burbank last night.
I had to go outside, swung by Eddie's,

848
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:13,040
I counted six fucking karate
schools, kickboxing. Uh, the kicker.

849
00:48:13,070 --> 00:48:15,160
Oh who's the other guy though?
That we are all fabulous.

850
00:48:15,161 --> 00:48:17,230
Benny Benny the jet has in school,

851
00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:21,750
I mean Burbank catnap the martial arts
hall of fame. Then the Jetson Burbank now,

852
00:48:21,790 --> 00:48:25,690
but in the Jetson Burbank man,
they got a new kid kickboxer school.

853
00:48:25,691 --> 00:48:30,370
They got to Gracie virus.
Yeah. When I used to Mexico,
when I first moved here, man,

854
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,140
I used to go to his place in Van Hise.

855
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:37,090
He would have all these gang bangers that
they would give a free classes too and

856
00:48:37,330 --> 00:48:40,870
let them work out. And you know, you'd
be like taking kickboxing classes,

857
00:48:40,871 --> 00:48:43,390
but this is funny gang bangers
man. It was, there was,

858
00:48:43,391 --> 00:48:45,640
there was some parts of it that were
kind of creepy and a lot of people were

859
00:48:45,641 --> 00:48:47,680
complaining about it cause
there was like a few problems.

860
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:52,430
But I remember this one dude came in and
he had a tattoo on his back that look

861
00:48:52,431 --> 00:48:55,470
like you drew it, you know,
and it said, whatever the,

862
00:48:55,471 --> 00:48:58,960
it was like vodka or something like that,
fuck the rest.

863
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:03,750
And he had it tattooed on his back. Wow.
I mean, it was like look like you did,

864
00:49:03,770 --> 00:49:07,130
or like anybody gave you a tattoo gun
for the first time and said, well,

865
00:49:07,131 --> 00:49:11,500
just see what you could do.
And I was, I was thinking like,

866
00:49:11,501 --> 00:49:13,660
this is not a guy you
want to punch in the face.

867
00:49:13,870 --> 00:49:17,760
This is not a guy who has a lot to
lose. Like, you know, this is, uh,

868
00:49:18,410 --> 00:49:21,160
this is Mike. I might want to just
keep my hands up and sticking mood.

869
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:25,420
Might want to just get in your car
and get the fuck. Yeah. Well there's,

870
00:49:26,050 --> 00:49:30,280
there was a, he had, there was, you know,
Benny the jet and then he, I think he had,

871
00:49:30,281 --> 00:49:34,150
um, uh, family members that would
also teach there too. I forgot.

872
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:36,280
I forgot the whole history of it,
so I don't want to talk about it.

873
00:49:36,281 --> 00:49:39,370
But they had a lot of, uh, there were
a lot, a lot of gang bangers car there.

874
00:49:39,530 --> 00:49:42,010
It was a big culture
shock thing coming from a,

875
00:49:43,390 --> 00:49:46,810
coming from New York and then moving
here and then taking kickboxing with

876
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:48,760
gangbangers. All right, fuck that.

877
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:49,661
Remember that?

878
00:49:49,661 --> 00:49:52,680
Remember that bug we were talking about
earlier that is counting on this trees.

879
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:56,130
It's cut an emerald ash borer and
look at that. It looks like a,

880
00:49:56,131 --> 00:49:59,560
a cricket at a disco. I mean
it's, it's scary looking.

881
00:49:59,561 --> 00:50:04,000
Looks High Tech looks like a robot
cricket. Yeah, it's like a Nissan Gtr bug

882
00:50:07,150 --> 00:50:08,110
and nothing does.

883
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:11,560
That's the thing that just goes into
trees and fucking lays a bunch of eggs and

884
00:50:11,561 --> 00:50:12,660
trees that destroys that.

885
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:15,370
The trees and then those things
hatch and become more of these.

886
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:18,650
It's like a fucking army of tree
killers. That's so funny. Fucking

887
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:22,460
nutty man. Yeah. It's so weird.
So what do we have to do?

888
00:50:22,461 --> 00:50:24,440
Bring over like Komodo
dragons eight these fucking,

889
00:50:24,441 --> 00:50:27,050
doesn't that look like alien technology
that that's take alien technology.

890
00:50:27,270 --> 00:50:28,100
Got nothing to do it.
No.

891
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:30,410
You know what's going to happen?
We going to fucking, dude, come on.

892
00:50:30,530 --> 00:50:32,450
This has been going on for years.
We started with termites.

893
00:50:32,451 --> 00:50:35,510
What do you expect from here of the fuck?

894
00:50:35,511 --> 00:50:38,210
I'm just saying this started years
ago with termites. They eat trees,

895
00:50:38,211 --> 00:50:40,530
they eat the roots.
I know to you,

896
00:50:40,650 --> 00:50:45,440
but it is new when it have
been invasive species waiting,

897
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:48,050
when we know we're bring them
weeded through cup with Miami. Wait,

898
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:50,750
that was coming in and those fucking
bags, right? I think we're just waiting.

899
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:55,250
Life's and fucking bugs and Palmetto
bugs or snakes with this couple of those

900
00:50:55,251 --> 00:50:56,450
fucking shipments,
you know,

901
00:50:56,700 --> 00:51:00,500
big nine foot fucking Cobra got in
from some fucking Columbia jungle.

902
00:51:00,710 --> 00:51:01,391
You think this and that.

903
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:04,640
And they got Dick's and they look
for ears and they always fucking,

904
00:51:04,641 --> 00:51:08,150
creeks is 2013 going to have a
new fucking creature every week.

905
00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:10,640
And I'm about to smoke my
little vapor so I'll get the

906
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:14,000
master motherfucking cushions.

907
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,390
I was smoking the shit on
the plane or it's tremendous.

908
00:51:17,710 --> 00:51:18,321
You know what's so funny?

909
00:51:18,321 --> 00:51:21,320
He was smoking on the plane
next to an old lady and I did.

910
00:51:21,321 --> 00:51:25,430
We talked about this yesterday and
w and I'm like, wow, that's crazy.

911
00:51:25,431 --> 00:51:26,900
I guess you know,
I guess you can do,

912
00:51:26,930 --> 00:51:29,930
probably is not against the law to
do those things. You know, vapor.

913
00:51:29,931 --> 00:51:33,440
If it was like an electronic
cigarette I guess. But then,

914
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:37,070
then he did it in a car when we're
driving to Pittsburgh and he just starts

915
00:51:37,071 --> 00:51:40,550
hitting it and all the windows are up and
immediately smelled weed. And I'm like,

916
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:44,300
if you did that on the plane, everybody
smelled that. It does smell like

917
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:46,860
we'd still a suction thing.
Right?

918
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:51,090
If you blow it can have a vacuum.

919
00:51:51,990 --> 00:51:55,650
So when you blow it over your
shoulder to the window to the left.

920
00:51:57,320 --> 00:52:00,660
But I was smoking on two
different flights. Nobody smells.

921
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:04,670
None about pot smoke man.
That when you're

922
00:52:04,850 --> 00:52:07,590
smoking, it doesn't smell like
anything. It's the weirdest thing. No,

923
00:52:07,670 --> 00:52:10,070
it's just like cigarettes.
Will you? Yeah, I bet it is.

924
00:52:10,071 --> 00:52:12,890
Just like you don't smell the
smell smoke on your own body.

925
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:17,120
Well that's a weird thing that they say
about smells that all factory senses,

926
00:52:17,210 --> 00:52:21,350
they only detect changes.
So like you can get used to a stinky town.

927
00:52:21,470 --> 00:52:23,840
That's how people live.
If they live like someplace,

928
00:52:23,841 --> 00:52:26,230
it has like a mail or something
like that, but yeah, yeah,

929
00:52:26,290 --> 00:52:30,680
that that could do it or I'm a think
slaughterhouses. That's a real problem.

930
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:32,780
How poop? Cow Pie. Yeah.

931
00:52:32,781 --> 00:52:36,560
If you pass like pastures and cows are
shitting all over the place and just

932
00:52:36,561 --> 00:52:41,180
stinks horribly fucked up. They shit so
much. It's just shit everywhere. Oh yeah.

933
00:52:41,181 --> 00:52:43,910
Drive by to shit.
You're smelling and shit.

934
00:52:44,050 --> 00:52:45,040
Yeah.
I go to my mom's house.

935
00:52:45,041 --> 00:52:49,780
I have to go buy like a good half mile
where the whole like air is just shit

936
00:52:49,781 --> 00:52:51,820
smell.
It smells like a thousand poops.

937
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:55,170
It's nature telling
you that this is dirty.

938
00:52:55,171 --> 00:52:57,390
You don't want to eat
anything anywhere near this.

939
00:52:57,391 --> 00:53:01,410
That's like a big warning sign.
That's why shit smells terrible.

940
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:07,280
Right? Oh fucking though. What do you
want her? I don't think you should.

941
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:07,850
Well,

942
00:53:07,850 --> 00:53:11,150
that thing on a plane and I'm going to
make you promise that you're not going to

943
00:53:11,151 --> 00:53:11,984
do that from now on.

944
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:15,050
And he got caught with it at an airport.
He

945
00:53:15,070 --> 00:53:17,920
did a bank, took it out, looked at
it. They couldn't even figure it out.

946
00:53:17,921 --> 00:53:20,230
Those fucking geniuses.
So the Capo,

947
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:22,690
when they gave it right back to me and
I was puffing all the way to the gate.

948
00:53:22,691 --> 00:53:24,040
Number three,
like a doctor,

949
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:31,200
what did you say it was when they
electric cigarette. Oh, didn't even ask.

950
00:53:31,230 --> 00:53:34,020
How's that one for you? Didn't
even ask. They didn't even ask.

951
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:34,920
They just looked at it.

952
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:38,250
They want to know if it was like some
sort of a gene Simmons bomb from one of

953
00:53:38,251 --> 00:53:40,400
those movies such whenever
the thing, a little while. But

954
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:45,930
Rutger Hauer gimme the bonus. Fuck
the bonus. They pulled the thing.

955
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:50,040
I might think just the fat
seen the movie's horrible,

956
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:53,400
but that seeing this fucking listen man.
How many movies did Gene Simmons do?

957
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:54,893
I don't know why.

958
00:53:54,990 --> 00:53:58,200
I know he played that and I showed them
on an episode of Miami Vice One time.

959
00:53:58,950 --> 00:54:02,940
That's it. I never seen him, but he's
probably done a bunch of fucking movies.

960
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:04,820
He was on an episode of Miami Vice.
Yeah,

961
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:10,230
he played like a drug dealer was shot
Miami Vice changed the fucking game.

962
00:54:10,230 --> 00:54:12,750
Dude started wearing blazers and no socks.

963
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:16,140
They started wearing
loafers with no socks. Why?

964
00:54:16,510 --> 00:54:19,950
Because that's what they wore in Miami.
Vice one to be like, you're in Miami.

965
00:54:19,951 --> 00:54:22,200
Do start buying white cars.
Fuck.

966
00:54:22,201 --> 00:54:26,160
Bought a white car before 1980 there's
was white cars. Get out of here.

967
00:54:26,161 --> 00:54:30,510
What your stupid fucking white car.
How many white Corvettes or do you see?

968
00:54:30,511 --> 00:54:35,070
This is like 10 of them ever made white
seems white whites only for like Honda

969
00:54:35,071 --> 00:54:39,660
at courts or something and they saw that
white Testarossa. They went, oh shit.

970
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:44,400
Did you see will white wheels too? You
see will Smith is slap that dude. Yeah,

971
00:54:44,430 --> 00:54:47,280
that's crazy. And then he lied. He's like
tried to kiss me in the mouth. I'm like,

972
00:54:47,281 --> 00:54:49,980
Hey, we can all see the video. He
didn't try to kiss you in the mouth.

973
00:54:50,140 --> 00:54:52,870
Kisses face a few times. He might've
been trying to kiss them, you know,

974
00:54:52,890 --> 00:54:56,610
in the mouth. It might've been like some
polling or I didn't think about that.

975
00:54:58,020 --> 00:55:00,820
I don't like that either.
Bad slap them. You know, he,

976
00:55:01,050 --> 00:55:04,620
he barely touched me and he just
went like this and the guy's face and

977
00:55:04,621 --> 00:55:07,470
everybody's saying that it was
like some assault. Oh my God.

978
00:55:07,471 --> 00:55:11,280
And out of here it's
like always at publicity.

979
00:55:11,281 --> 00:55:14,740
He's up at events with somebody
at the longest shot thing,

980
00:55:14,741 --> 00:55:18,200
so at least said something to fucking Burt
Reynolds and Burt rose bushes. Listen,

981
00:55:18,230 --> 00:55:22,080
he's 66 years old. He was just trying
to get publicity for the fucking movie,

982
00:55:22,081 --> 00:55:23,880
you know what I'm saying?
Probably not even,

983
00:55:23,881 --> 00:55:28,080
I suppose as ego guy came over
and said something was just like,

984
00:55:28,081 --> 00:55:32,310
did you see the original one got goes?
No. Burt Reynolds smack them. Really,

985
00:55:32,550 --> 00:55:35,450
really? Whoa. That online is that,

986
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:40,180
oh you got to see Max
guy run smack the fight.

987
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:42,780
The Burt Reynolds is one of those guys
where I look at him and I kind of feel

988
00:55:42,781 --> 00:55:46,890
bad, you know? And I see like his face
all stretched out. Like when I was a kid,

989
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:48,810
I looked at Burt,
run onto my tech guys.

990
00:55:48,811 --> 00:55:52,560
This shit like I remember like smokey
and the bandit, he's always smiling.

991
00:55:52,590 --> 00:55:53,550
That's what I would always think.

992
00:55:53,551 --> 00:55:56,490
Like this guy looks like he's always
having a great time to have a good sub to

993
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:58,430
marry Loni Anderson that fucked him.

994
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:01,980
I shot him down and left the with
pills and he was willing, but dog,

995
00:56:02,010 --> 00:56:05,160
you watch them even to the longest shot
at the beginning of the longest yard.

996
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:10,500
He goes in, he beats the bitch.
Bitch, the bitch. Watch the movie.

997
00:56:10,770 --> 00:56:13,980
He gets in the car and what fucking
songs does he get out when it turns it on

998
00:56:14,610 --> 00:56:18,990
Saturday night? Special Leopard
skin. Watch it. So fuck.

999
00:56:19,230 --> 00:56:24,010
He's got a Valora jacket on with fucking
patches of the she. They look like a

1000
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:27,190
fucking, he looks like the
guy that played superfly.

1001
00:56:27,610 --> 00:56:30,790
That's what he looks like in that
movie. Smack. So he's laying in bed.

1002
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:34,750
She's giving him a hard time. He
smacks her. He takes her fucking car.

1003
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:37,750
Saturday night special
drives, it cuts off. Cops,

1004
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:40,390
takes it to the ocean
and dumps into the ocean.

1005
00:56:40,391 --> 00:56:44,470
Then goes to the bar and they come get
them at the bar and they start fucking

1006
00:56:44,471 --> 00:56:46,300
around.
He beats the one cop up.

1007
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:50,080
Then they take them to Burt Reynolds was
the shit. Here's us. Here's the video.

1008
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:53,210
Burt Reynolds apparently got
little slap happy last night.

1009
00:56:53,990 --> 00:56:57,320
QBS producer at a movie
premiere and Chelsea,

1010
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:01,790
and we're the only ones with the video
was Michael Palmer on here now with the a

1011
00:57:01,850 --> 00:57:05,870
blow by blow, Michael Maurice Reynolds
attending the premiere of his new film,

1012
00:57:05,871 --> 00:57:09,860
really a remake of his old pill and the
longest yard when neither in jest or an

1013
00:57:09,861 --> 00:57:11,270
anger,
depending on who you believe.

1014
00:57:11,271 --> 00:57:15,560
Reynold slap the CVS employee who was
asking the star about that movie and today

1015
00:57:15,570 --> 00:57:18,920
she'd be as new says it is looking into
the matter. You judge for yourself.

1016
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:23,590
I don't know anything about it.

1017
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:48,690
I liked the guy.

1018
00:57:54,150 --> 00:57:59,150
The audio is hard produces nobody knows
a smack like the dude who got smacked of

1019
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:00,910
2020 by the wrestler.

1020
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:06,030
It's a punk with that little backhand
backhanded gave the dude that wrestler

1021
00:58:06,031 --> 00:58:09,630
when he fucking smacked, what's
his name? Tom? Something like

1022
00:58:12,330 --> 00:58:16,890
that boy got up, but he
fucking smack them with a hand.

1023
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:21,990
That was a smack Wilson make giving
this guy a fucking loved that.

1024
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:26,910
Oh Will Smith did was go touch the
guy with his fingers on his face.

1025
00:58:26,911 --> 00:58:29,100
Anybody who calls what
will Smith did a slap.

1026
00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:32,250
He gently did this to the guy's face.
It was like,

1027
00:58:32,251 --> 00:58:34,890
so it was so non aggressive.
Yeah.

1028
00:58:34,891 --> 00:58:37,680
This guy's a fucking huge dude.

1029
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:44,720
That's terrific. That all you got.
I asked you the standard questions.

1030
00:58:45,330 --> 00:58:49,260
Standard questions. I think at this bank
you're going to get bike. There you go.

1031
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:53,560
What the Hell is wrong with you?
That's the open hand slap.

1032
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:55,020
You think it's thinking

1033
00:59:01,290 --> 00:59:03,800
after the fucking real guys,
that dude cough

1034
00:59:05,310 --> 00:59:09,560
to cough as a guy not getting paid
enough to do his job well, you know,

1035
00:59:09,570 --> 00:59:13,220
it's also the way he said it was very
arrogant, like he was going to be safe.

1036
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:16,660
I think it's fake know it's not,
you know,

1037
00:59:16,670 --> 00:59:20,990
saying it's fake de fucking Duh.
Everyone knows it's,

1038
00:59:21,740 --> 00:59:22,100
you know,

1039
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:26,540
it's, it's, it's obviously planned out in
advance, but to say it's not a tough job.

1040
00:59:26,570 --> 00:59:30,000
You're crazy. Those guys are always
busted up. Those guys are always,

1041
00:59:30,001 --> 00:59:31,530
they get hooked on pain stuff.

1042
00:59:31,550 --> 00:59:35,900
What they did the exam wrestling on
2020 and they showed us all the tricks,

1043
00:59:36,230 --> 00:59:39,120
how they would take the razor blade
and cut you off. Yeah. Yeah, yeah,

1044
00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:40,640
make it bleed.
Bleed.

1045
00:59:40,641 --> 00:59:43,310
That was a great expert as a lot of
people didn't know about that shit.

1046
00:59:43,570 --> 00:59:44,540
Imagine they did that.

1047
00:59:44,541 --> 00:59:47,810
They used to cut their own hair and I
knew about it because one of the training

1048
00:59:47,811 --> 00:59:48,860
schools in New Jersey,

1049
00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:51,740
so when I was going to graduate school
and the teachers kept telling me,

1050
00:59:51,741 --> 00:59:55,370
if you're good guys, we'll take it to the
wrestling. I know chief Jay Strongbow,

1051
00:59:55,371 --> 00:59:56,800
whatever.
It's all fake and shit.

1052
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:59,300
When I found that wrestling
was faking the fourth grade,

1053
00:59:59,301 --> 01:00:00,740
I was pissed for about 10 minutes.

1054
01:00:00,890 --> 01:00:04,460
I went to El [inaudible] the other day
and they had the Mexican wrestling on

1055
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:09,260
those due to have some fucking dope moves,
man about the outfits.

1056
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:12,920
The outfits are outstanding
dudes with like long Conan here.

1057
01:00:12,921 --> 01:00:15,200
No one looks like they've
ever even heard of steroids.

1058
01:00:15,410 --> 01:00:18,560
It's so weird because steroids are
legal in Mexico and these dudes are like

1059
01:00:18,561 --> 01:00:22,610
regular looking dude,
but they had some crazy moves.

1060
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:25,540
I was like really impressed,
like jumping through the air,

1061
01:00:25,550 --> 01:00:29,330
wrapping their legs around the dude's neck
and flipping the dude through the air.

1062
01:00:29,510 --> 01:00:32,750
Like they did some nutty shit that
was like, wow, that is acrobatic.

1063
01:00:32,751 --> 01:00:36,830
If you can't appreciate that, I mean
obviously it is theater, but there's,

1064
01:00:36,831 --> 01:00:39,050
there's a physicality to it that you,
you know,

1065
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:42,200
it's very disrespectful to call it fake.
It's not fake.

1066
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:45,920
That little attitude he
did that. Oh, Sassy. Yeah.

1067
01:00:46,220 --> 01:00:51,220
He said it to a guy without any fear
of his own safety being protected.

1068
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:56,070
He thought by a camera and reality
and media wasn't shut down.

1069
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:59,930
The media wasn't what it was today.
The media wasn't shit.

1070
01:00:59,931 --> 01:01:01,730
They were just somebody who
was taken up your fucking,

1071
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:03,710
it just didn't have to be
cut to you about it. If he,

1072
01:01:03,711 --> 01:01:07,130
if he can communicate with
the guy and asked him,

1073
01:01:07,131 --> 01:01:09,670
are there predetermined
outcomes, how, you know, I mean,

1074
01:01:09,710 --> 01:01:11,570
that's what he should have said.
You know,

1075
01:01:11,571 --> 01:01:13,700
instead of saying like the way he did it.
Yeah.

1076
01:01:13,701 --> 01:01:18,190
Well I'll steal the standard question. Is
it fake? It looks fake to me. You know,

1077
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:23,180
like, wow, you're, you're, you're,
you're, you're pawing of a lion. Like,

1078
01:01:23,181 --> 01:01:27,200
look at the size of that guy, that guy.
You don't feel uncomfortable with that.

1079
01:01:27,201 --> 01:01:30,530
This guy's all sweaty and hyped up from
a fucking wrestling match where they

1080
01:01:30,531 --> 01:01:33,980
always get kneed in the head and fucking
kicked in the head accidentally and

1081
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:34,830
punched in the head.

1082
01:01:34,830 --> 01:01:37,580
I think you see some of the shit they
do where they do feel like flying

1083
01:01:37,581 --> 01:01:39,350
sidekicks and hit each other in the head.

1084
01:01:39,410 --> 01:01:41,270
They hit each other in the fucking head,
man.

1085
01:01:41,390 --> 01:01:44,220
There's a lot of times they're actually
hitting each other. It's not PR.

1086
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,520
Even if it's choreographed,

1087
01:01:46,521 --> 01:01:50,480
it's not precise as a fucking really
hard way to make a living. What's funny,

1088
01:01:50,481 --> 01:01:51,410
when I went to Miami,

1089
01:01:51,730 --> 01:01:54,850
April that week was also Wrestlemania,

1090
01:01:55,290 --> 01:01:57,790
so all these old timers in Miami,

1091
01:01:58,450 --> 01:02:01,880
so every radio show I went to do
that week had an old time rescue.

1092
01:02:01,881 --> 01:02:05,590
I was talking about it and it
was very interesting to see that,

1093
01:02:05,591 --> 01:02:09,100
believe it or not, these guys still
have followings. Oh, I believe it.

1094
01:02:09,101 --> 01:02:10,430
They still have followings.

1095
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:13,750
They do all those things that they show
you in the wrestler where they people

1096
01:02:13,751 --> 01:02:18,210
come and t shirts and talking about 1981
I wonder where the Jimmy superfly snuck

1097
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:20,370
is ice.
Do you remember the fucking,

1098
01:02:20,380 --> 01:02:24,510
the, the war. He used to live
in boulder in his heyday did it.

1099
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:28,830
He was up in boulder. Shoot fucking
it by that. A juice slim jams.

1100
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:30,660
This mother fucker.

1101
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:35,550
I remember one time seeing him at the
Potter carwash he had at that time,

1102
01:02:35,551 --> 01:02:39,870
nobody had a seven BMW in the early
eighties I don't even think they made them

1103
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:43,800
and he had them just because he had a
fit one and I'll never forget it was off

1104
01:02:43,801 --> 01:02:45,870
season or something and he
got out of that fucking car,

1105
01:02:45,871 --> 01:02:50,100
Joe and he had a vein that was a court,
I don't have to lie to know,

1106
01:02:50,101 --> 01:02:53,640
but they go look at fucking the
ultimate warrior giant dude and dogs,

1107
01:02:53,641 --> 01:02:58,530
but his veins, his biceps with some
of the biggest, most that was a bicep,

1108
01:02:58,860 --> 01:03:03,390
but he had a vein out of here that lifted
three quarters of an inch from his arm.

1109
01:03:03,390 --> 01:03:06,510
I seen it. I looked at it,
stared at it and like was like,

1110
01:03:06,511 --> 01:03:09,810
let me see how far his
vein in his bicep went up.

1111
01:03:09,811 --> 01:03:11,920
Three quarters of an inch
off the skin brown. Yeah.

1112
01:03:11,980 --> 01:03:14,950
There's a lot of people don't realize
how big those that do some and see if you

1113
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:18,150
get ultimate warrior shaft. For
me, I saw a hog in the first time,

1114
01:03:18,180 --> 01:03:20,640
like when I was in Hollywood,
like it was right outside of, um,

1115
01:03:20,970 --> 01:03:21,870
before I've met him.

1116
01:03:21,871 --> 01:03:26,871
I met him at a UFC and I had the honor
of interviewing them once I get to talk.

1117
01:03:27,301 --> 01:03:29,100
That was fun because I got to like talk,

1118
01:03:29,130 --> 01:03:33,630
like get excited about pro wrestling
with them, you know, and they pump it up.

1119
01:03:33,690 --> 01:03:37,310
He's fucking great. His gray, that
guy's got a lot of pain now it's got,

1120
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:42,000
I mean he's gone through. You ever see
like all the operations? Holy Shit.

1121
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:46,080
That's the ultimate warrior. That's the
whole fan. And how tall is that dude?

1122
01:03:46,950 --> 01:03:51,600
He's like six, three or some shit. I'll
talk. Don't focus on this deck Brian.

1123
01:03:51,601 --> 01:03:54,780
That's how I was looking at his own shirt.
He's busting through his own shirt.

1124
01:03:54,781 --> 01:03:59,730
But you know as far as crazy though,
why does he have a heart finger?

1125
01:04:00,510 --> 01:04:01,440
I think it's just Europe.

1126
01:04:03,450 --> 01:04:06,540
Is this Richard Simmons
looking at his face? Crazy.

1127
01:04:06,710 --> 01:04:10,710
Isn't it crazy that they decided to like
paint your face up and the outfit with

1128
01:04:10,711 --> 01:04:14,370
the suspenders? Whatever the fuck they,
I look at his arms. This guy was pretty,

1129
01:04:14,371 --> 01:04:18,570
Yo came in the barbarian bros. I remember
seeing when I was a kid, those two guys,

1130
01:04:18,571 --> 01:04:21,060
they were in the Flamingo Kid.
I don't know what happened to those guys.

1131
01:04:21,450 --> 01:04:23,940
Face paint like war paint a strange thing.

1132
01:04:24,090 --> 01:04:26,650
The idea that you know you're gonna,

1133
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:30,030
you're gonna draw your face up
to make yourself look meaner.

1134
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:31,260
When you go to battle,

1135
01:04:31,310 --> 01:04:36,310
like that's going to matter is like the
ritual of rubbing shit on your face and

1136
01:04:36,661 --> 01:04:39,420
put your wore mask on
before you go into battle.

1137
01:04:39,450 --> 01:04:43,620
Like where the fuck did that ever come
from it? Does it make someone extra scary?

1138
01:04:43,621 --> 01:04:45,330
Or if they got black
stuff all over their face,

1139
01:04:45,390 --> 01:04:47,350
but he's talking to the
bottom of the street, we,

1140
01:04:47,351 --> 01:04:49,620
you're talking like that for
them to be an American Indians.

1141
01:04:49,620 --> 01:04:51,220
And I'm talking about,
you know,

1142
01:04:51,260 --> 01:04:55,770
different people that have put war paint
on with over the years the American

1143
01:04:55,771 --> 01:04:59,900
Indians symbolize, remember Braveheart,
he put like fucking Cheetos or something.

1144
01:04:59,910 --> 01:05:04,230
But like if you're in the green baret
you gotta go take paint your face green.

1145
01:05:04,450 --> 01:05:08,850
That's yeah, but it's still,
it must put you there. Yeah.

1146
01:05:09,060 --> 01:05:13,470
The ritual that it's time to fucking rock.
It's time to get go crazy.

1147
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:14,610
It's got to get you.

1148
01:05:14,670 --> 01:05:17,330
That's how you probably get fired
up by putting the makeup on.

1149
01:05:17,331 --> 01:05:20,860
And when they do you guys
remember this date announcement.

1150
01:05:21,100 --> 01:05:24,940
So what do you want to do? I don't
know. What do you want to do?

1151
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:48,930
And

1152
01:05:48,930 --> 01:05:53,470
for those that I didn't watch this,
but rather listen to this podcast,

1153
01:05:53,980 --> 01:05:58,450
that might be one the most retarded thing.
It's a big giant Roy it up.

1154
01:05:58,451 --> 01:06:03,070
Dude handed out slim Jim. Is he
still alive? Is that guy still alive?

1155
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:05,620
That's deck at the rob
lit like a motherfucker.

1156
01:06:05,650 --> 01:06:09,940
He's still alive before they
figured out the test. Wow.

1157
01:06:09,970 --> 01:06:14,680
I wonder what it looks like now
in Slim Jim.

1158
01:06:16,450 --> 01:06:19,990
What a strange ad. What is it
supposed to be snapping to a slim Jim.

1159
01:06:20,140 --> 01:06:24,130
And why are you so angry, sir? What's
going on here? You're fucking going nutty.

1160
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:25,420
Screaming and flexing.

1161
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:29,590
I'm going to do a slim kid bites into it.

1162
01:06:29,591 --> 01:06:33,490
He flies out of your shoes like what
the fuck kind of physics are we dealing

1163
01:06:33,491 --> 01:06:38,170
with here? What is it? What kind of
who? Who Green lit that commercial?

1164
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:41,860
I think they ultimate warrior
has a blog now. Oh he does? Yeah.

1165
01:06:42,340 --> 01:06:45,490
Well how fun would it be just to
start shooting steroids and that stop.

1166
01:06:46,090 --> 01:06:48,940
Just get crazy and go hulk
style. They go, you know what?

1167
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:52,420
I'm going to start fucking eating
them and I'm not even doing cycles.

1168
01:06:52,450 --> 01:06:54,940
Well I think if you look at
those guys who have done that,

1169
01:06:54,941 --> 01:06:56,560
like it is possible stay alive.

1170
01:06:56,590 --> 01:07:01,230
Like look at the guys who were like
big time professional bodybuilders.

1171
01:07:01,610 --> 01:07:04,180
They're still like, they're still
out there. They're, you know,

1172
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:07,900
they get off the shit and they, their
body shrinks down to like normal size.

1173
01:07:07,930 --> 01:07:10,110
I want to know what Tom Platz,
his legs looked like tonight.

1174
01:07:10,140 --> 01:07:12,640
That's when you got to find, that's what
we got a fund. That's a good question.

1175
01:07:12,641 --> 01:07:14,980
I want to know what Tom Platz
looks like to that. I want to know.

1176
01:07:15,330 --> 01:07:18,350
We all look no look like, listen
bro. The first time you've seen,

1177
01:07:18,820 --> 01:07:22,630
what was the movie pumping iron was the
shit. You can say whatever the fuck.

1178
01:07:22,690 --> 01:07:24,020
I don't know.
The Franco Columbo,

1179
01:07:24,050 --> 01:07:26,950
a little fucking Italian with
that back from here to here,

1180
01:07:27,490 --> 01:07:30,940
laying brick and block all his life.
He was like, I'd get a big blog.

1181
01:07:30,941 --> 01:07:33,370
I the fuck out your face,
your whole family tree,

1182
01:07:33,371 --> 01:07:36,770
late fucking 12 inch block built
everything and fucking hit.

1183
01:07:36,771 --> 01:07:39,880
When you look at you, you're a
little flock. He was, he was yoked.

1184
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,660
He was a strong dude. Isn't
it funny that you, you,

1185
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:47,050
you said Tom Platz and we both know
that that guy was associated with having

1186
01:07:47,051 --> 01:07:50,200
giant legs. It's like he's sitting on
Hummus. I remember his incredible though.

1187
01:07:50,290 --> 01:07:52,260
There's no other guy that has like that.

1188
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:55,630
Like there is synonymous with
just one body parts, legs.

1189
01:07:57,130 --> 01:08:01,990
His legs were giant. You know,
Campbell had big legs, but uh,

1190
01:08:02,380 --> 01:08:07,110
uh, Tom Platz had just ripped, I'm
sorry. There were giant to shred.

1191
01:08:07,180 --> 01:08:12,100
You find that picture.
They were so big legs just to show flats.

1192
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:16,670
T Z. He was like 10 80. If you can't
cause that's what he was a king.

1193
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:20,930
His upper body was big. I mean, he
was a shooting, nothing like his legs.

1194
01:08:20,931 --> 01:08:25,490
His legs were shooting in their legs.
Look at that.

1195
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:30,040
Look at his jaw. Look on his
fucking jaw, his jaw, his shoes.

1196
01:08:30,350 --> 01:08:34,710
He's got muscle and it's, that guy would
crack a fucking Ari penis. Look at him.

1197
01:08:34,820 --> 01:08:36,140
Look at his leg.
Look at that.

1198
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:39,890
This is 1982 looking at
his cheeks back up again.

1199
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:43,970
Oh my God. Look at his, his, his
legs are the freakiest thing.

1200
01:08:43,971 --> 01:08:47,660
Now look how much they stand out from
the rest of his body. That's insane.

1201
01:08:48,350 --> 01:08:52,100
It's like somebody opened up his legs
and stuck a whole basketball in there.

1202
01:08:52,170 --> 01:08:56,210
He's got a basketball in each leg.
Look at the fucking size of those things.

1203
01:08:56,570 --> 01:09:00,350
They're crazy. That is the craziest
Shit I've ever seen in my life. Ever.

1204
01:09:00,530 --> 01:09:04,910
Ever seen 80 he has a waste
for each thigh. That's insane.

1205
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:08,750
Look at the veins going to the fucking
leg. What the fuck are they shooting?

1206
01:09:08,751 --> 01:09:13,730
And he has no balls whatsoever. If
you look fucking legs, when you look,

1207
01:09:13,731 --> 01:09:17,300
when they get to like this size,
there's so juice to the gills.

1208
01:09:17,301 --> 01:09:21,750
Their balls or shot town.
They just tapped show.

1209
01:09:21,870 --> 01:09:25,130
Look at the size of him.
My God, he was enormous.

1210
01:09:26,460 --> 01:09:30,270
I got find it. It looks
like today. Christ. Hi God.

1211
01:09:30,330 --> 01:09:32,090
Look at the fucking sign.

1212
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:38,220
Oh my God.
That's like from another animal.

1213
01:09:38,221 --> 01:09:41,370
It's like he took some meat off of
a horse and put it on to his body,

1214
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:43,920
but he used to like try to
sell leg workouts. You're like,

1215
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:47,250
no one wants to have legs like Tom.
That's number one.

1216
01:09:47,251 --> 01:09:51,470
Number two was not no fucking running up
hills. Got You. That shit. Not only that,

1217
01:09:51,471 --> 01:09:56,330
it's also a genetic issue. He must have
crazy genetics. That's what it looks like.

1218
01:09:56,331 --> 01:10:00,740
That one of those milestones. What
is balls live on here? Issue dogs.

1219
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:02,100
See if we could find that picture.

1220
01:10:02,101 --> 01:10:06,690
I look at Robbie Robertson and
then the black guy. Oh my God,

1221
01:10:06,691 --> 01:10:11,520
this is fucking Robertson.
Oh my God. Jesus Christ.

1222
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:16,620
God, look at this. There's a photo.

1223
01:10:16,621 --> 01:10:18,960
We're looking at a photo of his back,
Ladies and gentlemen,

1224
01:10:18,961 --> 01:10:22,650
and it doesn't even look possible.
It doesn't only possible.

1225
01:10:22,651 --> 01:10:26,050
It looks like if you were going
to do like a cartoon on what, uh,

1226
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:29,400
you know a bodybuilder would look
like. You know, like if you were,

1227
01:10:30,490 --> 01:10:34,470
if you were drawing it for south park
or something, I can't even be real.

1228
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:41,160
Isn't it crazy though that that's what
happens when you do shit like try to have

1229
01:10:41,161 --> 01:10:45,540
competitions where you see who has the
best body and the biggest muscles like

1230
01:10:45,541 --> 01:10:49,790
standards sorta change. And then
just like fake tits, like the,

1231
01:10:49,791 --> 01:10:53,880
the standard becomes the unnatural,
unachievable without drugs. Look.

1232
01:10:53,881 --> 01:10:55,560
But what's crazy about this,
Joe,

1233
01:10:55,561 --> 01:11:00,000
is I thought that weightlifting and
steroids and recovery and everything has

1234
01:11:00,060 --> 01:11:02,040
excelled so much in 30 years.

1235
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:05,430
That had to be 1982 when
Tom Platz took that picture.

1236
01:11:05,910 --> 01:11:10,180
That's 30 fucking years ago.
Oh look at that picture.

1237
01:11:10,550 --> 01:11:14,010
He looks great. He's got
no, he's got no pants

1238
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:18,000
on and he's flexing his legs.
That's cartoon land is cartoon.

1239
01:11:18,010 --> 01:11:22,860
So cartoonish. It's crazy. He looks
like a crazy, he has extra muscles

1240
01:11:22,870 --> 01:11:26,850
in his legs. It's, I mean, and
he became famous for it too,

1241
01:11:27,270 --> 01:11:30,600
so that became like the
thing he concentrated on.

1242
01:11:30,630 --> 01:11:33,720
If you keep hearing that sucking in
the background, that's Joey Diaz.

1243
01:11:34,170 --> 01:11:38,100
He's using some, some device. He's
Jewish. He went right into the microphone.

1244
01:11:38,810 --> 01:11:41,300
Eureka vapor like a motherfucker.
Joe Rogan.

1245
01:11:42,290 --> 01:11:46,760
That's uh, that's amazing that Tom Platz
guy. That's amazing. That's shocking.

1246
01:11:46,940 --> 01:11:50,960
It's amazing what a person can do. You
can, the way you could change your body,

1247
01:11:51,650 --> 01:11:56,450
just sticking some stuff in there and
do a fuck load of squads. Yeah, brother.

1248
01:11:57,170 --> 01:12:01,160
What are you doing? Joey did, is he
tweeting? That's been text messages.

1249
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:03,950
I have my wife

1250
01:12:08,210 --> 01:12:09,000
Brian.
Do you think

1251
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,890
we'd ever be uh, willing to, uh,

1252
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:14,820
get on a bodybuilding program and
do roids for like a TV show now,

1253
01:12:14,850 --> 01:12:19,850
but I'm supposed to Saturday I go
to Richard Simmons and his class,

1254
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:23,730
his class doing it just because I think
it will be funny. Oh, it'd be amazing.

1255
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:27,950
Where are you going to do is climbing?
It's in Santa Monica. It's called. Yeah,

1256
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,990
I do. I want to, I have
to do the UFC though.

1257
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:36,500
Saturday is the UFC. It's like, it's
like sweating to the then how often?

1258
01:12:37,110 --> 01:12:39,810
How often is he there?
I think he does it like every week.

1259
01:12:41,250 --> 01:12:42,210
Richard Simmons,

1260
01:12:42,540 --> 01:12:46,100
do you fucking work out
with Richard Simmons and all
these really old ladies and

1261
01:12:46,110 --> 01:12:47,910
gay guys and we're gonna make it happen.

1262
01:12:47,940 --> 01:12:50,970
Let's work out with Richard Simmons
Saturday. I mean look, either way it's,

1263
01:12:51,210 --> 01:12:52,140
you'd be amazed.

1264
01:12:52,141 --> 01:12:55,560
It's a good workout if you tried to do
sweating to the oldies and he actually

1265
01:12:55,561 --> 01:12:57,750
kept that. It's like a nice
little workout, you know?

1266
01:12:59,860 --> 01:13:03,240
I think if I get really baked, it's going
to be the best thing I've ever to cost.

1267
01:13:03,241 --> 01:13:06,660
I think it's like 60 bucks. That's
worth it. I left the y today.

1268
01:13:06,661 --> 01:13:11,570
They would do and a, what's the country
line? Country? My mind aerobics,

1269
01:13:12,390 --> 01:13:15,570
bunch of fucking big rednecks and
they're fucking doing aerobics.

1270
01:13:15,970 --> 01:13:20,120
Well like country line dance and mixed
with aerobics. It's like fucking zoom.

1271
01:13:20,121 --> 01:13:23,640
So line dancing, line dancing
mixed with the Roche aerobics.

1272
01:13:23,641 --> 01:13:26,870
It's amazing what people do for
jump up and down. I tell you what I,

1273
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:31,770
I'm really digging that Mike Dolce book,
Bro. I'm really, I love the, I never,

1274
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:33,360
I always said to myself,

1275
01:13:33,390 --> 01:13:36,690
why do people go to the
widely on a fucking treadmill
where you can walk around

1276
01:13:36,691 --> 01:13:39,810
in north Hollywood park and get
some vitamin D and really sweat.

1277
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:42,740
Then I read his book,
like I told you on the plant.

1278
01:13:43,020 --> 01:13:45,690
The diet stuff is hard for me cause
I don't like a lot of vegetables.

1279
01:13:45,990 --> 01:13:49,420
But the fucking workouts, you know,
the beginner treadmill workout,

1280
01:13:49,421 --> 01:13:54,000
it's sensational. I can't do
the full speed yet, but I'm
doing it. You know, it's,

1281
01:13:54,060 --> 01:13:56,940
I'm doing it.
He's coming on the podcast soon please.

1282
01:13:56,941 --> 01:13:58,860
He's saying it's going to be on the
weekends and you know what I'm saying?

1283
01:13:58,861 --> 01:14:01,650
He's fucking great. He really is.
That book has really helped me.

1284
01:14:01,651 --> 01:14:04,890
A lot of them understanding I can't
do a lot of shit cause of my knee,

1285
01:14:04,891 --> 01:14:09,390
but he's got great basic exercises and
I, you know, when I was really skinny,

1286
01:14:09,391 --> 01:14:12,060
that's how I got size,
doing little strength

1287
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:13,810
things.
So I know where he's coming from.

1288
01:14:14,140 --> 01:14:17,740
I mean in this book he talks about how
he went up and a bunch of weight that he

1289
01:14:17,741 --> 01:14:21,730
lost it just to prove his
point, that strength. So I
understand what he's saying.

1290
01:14:21,731 --> 01:14:25,000
So I really enjoy the one book. I have
the one I'm going to get the other one.

1291
01:14:25,001 --> 01:14:28,420
I couldn't find that you ought to all
three of them at the tee shirt and it's

1292
01:14:28,421 --> 01:14:31,660
not a bad deal. I just couldn't
find that particular thing.

1293
01:14:31,661 --> 01:14:32,950
So I ordered it on Amazon

1294
01:14:33,620 --> 01:14:36,530
but I think he's actually doing
the podcast next week. Yeah.

1295
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,870
Do at least he's, we'll have questions
for him. His Shit because uh,

1296
01:14:41,180 --> 01:14:43,070
his book is really helping
me a lot of things.

1297
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:46,980
We had a lot of podcasts next
week, Dude. We got dolce,

1298
01:14:47,010 --> 01:14:50,820
we got Bassnectar I got
to get back with that too.

1299
01:14:50,910 --> 01:14:54,780
And we got bobcat Goldthwait
and we've got Shane Smith. Dude,

1300
01:14:54,781 --> 01:14:56,220
we're becoming on your television show.

1301
01:14:56,970 --> 01:14:59,310
Hopefully we don't run out of shit
tight that I'd tell you what man,

1302
01:14:59,311 --> 01:15:01,980
I went to Adam Carolla's place
yesterday and for first of all,

1303
01:15:01,981 --> 01:15:05,420
we need more employees
cause he has 10 right.

1304
01:15:06,720 --> 01:15:11,160
And second of all, I got mad podcast
studio envy, his fucking set up.

1305
01:15:11,161 --> 01:15:14,880
It's so sweet. Adam Corolla is
a savage. He built his own shit.

1306
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:18,600
He built his own broadcast man,
man, he's a man's man. He's a,

1307
01:15:18,601 --> 01:15:22,530
he's a fucking construction
worker fella. He's out there. He,

1308
01:15:22,531 --> 01:15:26,200
he wired everything. So it all goes under
the floor and it comes out through the,

1309
01:15:26,550 --> 01:15:30,180
the legs of the table. The wires go
through the legs of the table like that.

1310
01:15:30,260 --> 01:15:33,360
So there's no wires exposed
and the whole thing is set up.

1311
01:15:33,390 --> 01:15:35,820
It's really fucking sweet.
It's really sweet.

1312
01:15:36,030 --> 01:15:39,120
It's got cameras like high def cameras
facing everybody and they're all

1313
01:15:39,121 --> 01:15:42,450
controlled and remote control. It's kind
of like a little broadcast booth. I mean,

1314
01:15:42,460 --> 01:15:43,800
it's amazing what he's done.

1315
01:15:43,860 --> 01:15:47,560
Like you over there and he'd
get mad podcast studio envy,

1316
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:53,070
took it to the next level. He's making
it happen. We got to follow that.

1317
01:15:53,100 --> 01:15:56,610
Did you have a nice time though, Jim and
I show he was great. He's a great guy.

1318
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:58,810
But you guys talking
about the girl else bros.

1319
01:15:58,811 --> 01:16:03,750
It's very funny to his little sidekick.
She's kidding. She's hilarious. Um,

1320
01:16:04,380 --> 01:16:09,080
what do we talk about? Everything.
You know, talking about punching.

1321
01:16:09,310 --> 01:16:12,440
Yeah. Talked about, uh, they like,
it was all these like, uh, you know,

1322
01:16:12,450 --> 01:16:15,560
like the hottest chicks in the world.
Like they had some thing where they like,

1323
01:16:15,561 --> 01:16:15,810
you know,

1324
01:16:15,810 --> 01:16:18,930
they were debating whether or not women
belong in the hot chicks for me and him,

1325
01:16:18,931 --> 01:16:22,300
a very different tastes. Like he was
talking about Olivia Munn, you know,

1326
01:16:22,670 --> 01:16:27,200
Olivia Maan it's hot as fuck, right?
That's about as hot as you can get. Okay.

1327
01:16:27,540 --> 01:16:31,400
But he was like, yeah, Gosh,
I have been to her house.
She's not really smelly feet.

1328
01:16:31,450 --> 01:16:35,790
He's out. They sound grounds. And
he was talking about, you know,

1329
01:16:35,820 --> 01:16:38,600
some girls will walk into a room and just,
you know,

1330
01:16:38,610 --> 01:16:41,820
everything's just stops and you
just want to talk to them. Right.

1331
01:16:41,821 --> 01:16:45,150
That Olivia one's not like that.
Like, all right, really that's crazy.

1332
01:16:45,320 --> 01:16:50,320
Talk live in my mom is all my top five.

1333
01:16:50,341 --> 01:16:51,700
And then she came out of nowhere.
You know,

1334
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:54,330
like I liked her on with like
Kevin Prayer on that show,

1335
01:16:54,390 --> 01:16:56,220
whatever attack attacking the show.
But I never,

1336
01:16:56,250 --> 01:16:59,930
but then I fell in love with her and
then she left the fucking sho. Now Sho,

1337
01:16:59,940 --> 01:17:02,290
he added that shut off Mike.
Let me tell you something.

1338
01:17:02,790 --> 01:17:06,430
Break time. Fuck Cleveland.
I just want to say it before

1339
01:17:06,430 --> 01:17:10,050
I forget. In Pittsburgh. I really
did. Yeah, me too because I

1340
01:17:10,050 --> 01:17:13,250
fucking Columbus man. There was
some crazy motherfuckers there is.

1341
01:17:13,251 --> 01:17:17,270
He rocked Jason. Justin though. Got
It. Made us the fucking edibles.

1342
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:20,540
I still got some fucking candy
left at the house. You know,

1343
01:17:20,541 --> 01:17:22,010
fucking Cleveland was crazy.

1344
01:17:22,011 --> 01:17:25,070
We were outside that garage shop
as a cool fucking spot, man.

1345
01:17:25,730 --> 01:17:28,820
That's a cool fucking spot. If you
don't want to perform at the Improv.

1346
01:17:28,830 --> 01:17:32,480
I got nothing against the Improv,
but that garage shop is a cool spot.

1347
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:35,030
Cool part of town.
You know Pittsburgh,

1348
01:17:35,031 --> 01:17:37,700
it was an honor to go to
fucking Pittsburgh, but man,

1349
01:17:37,701 --> 01:17:40,250
has the economy destroyed
those little cities, man.

1350
01:17:41,870 --> 01:17:45,560
The bar we were at is only open when
there's a Pittsburgh pirate game or a

1351
01:17:45,561 --> 01:17:49,400
football game and it's across the street
from the stadium. It's called Mullins.

1352
01:17:49,820 --> 01:17:50,780
They were fucking great.

1353
01:17:50,781 --> 01:17:54,530
The Barbecue Sandwich was great and the
guy who was telling me that it's just

1354
01:17:54,531 --> 01:17:58,310
people don't go to that side of
town number like people, you know,

1355
01:17:58,311 --> 01:18:00,170
this is not a seven
night a weekend history.

1356
01:18:00,170 --> 01:18:03,820
No more people going out and in Pittsburgh
they go out to watch the games that

1357
01:18:03,821 --> 01:18:06,110
get fucked up and they
go there and you know,

1358
01:18:06,370 --> 01:18:09,680
I've been going to Pittsburgh for 30
years. It's amazing that you look,

1359
01:18:09,681 --> 01:18:12,680
go to these cities and you see these
people and you say to yourself,

1360
01:18:12,681 --> 01:18:15,800
what's next for these people?
I mean this is the real core.

1361
01:18:15,801 --> 01:18:17,960
It's so funny how I was losing,

1362
01:18:18,020 --> 01:18:21,010
I was hating doing comedy
in that way and it,

1363
01:18:21,110 --> 01:18:25,100
and it transpired for me to like I was
starting to hate to do comedy and it was

1364
01:18:25,101 --> 01:18:29,600
because I was doing too much comedy in
l h o l I wasn't doing comedy for real

1365
01:18:29,601 --> 01:18:31,940
people. I was forgetting
what I was doing comedy for.

1366
01:18:32,450 --> 01:18:35,180
When you're in La a long
time like I was and we are,

1367
01:18:35,420 --> 01:18:37,640
we don't travel like normal headliners.

1368
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,450
They go out every week when I'm in La,

1369
01:18:40,460 --> 01:18:44,150
you thinking about shit that you think
in La and you think there's going to be

1370
01:18:44,151 --> 01:18:48,020
somebody in the audience or who's here
with you or what you're saying when

1371
01:18:48,021 --> 01:18:52,190
you're on the road and you're talking
to people in the Midwest or taxes that

1372
01:18:52,191 --> 01:18:55,040
fucking real,
you got to bring it a different way.

1373
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:59,630
I can't bring it like la way I got and
that's what I like about going on the

1374
01:18:59,631 --> 01:19:02,120
road again.
I really enjoy it like people like,

1375
01:19:02,121 --> 01:19:05,390
do you really like going to the Midwest?
No, I went there. I fucking love it.

1376
01:19:05,420 --> 01:19:06,510
I love going to Iowa.

1377
01:19:06,511 --> 01:19:09,770
I love going all those spots
like that once or twice a year.

1378
01:19:09,771 --> 01:19:12,800
Just to remind you that it's
not all the big city man.

1379
01:19:12,801 --> 01:19:16,190
We met some cool fucking beat hazing.
We've seen some great properties,

1380
01:19:16,310 --> 01:19:19,160
great trees spread out,
low traffic.

1381
01:19:19,430 --> 01:19:23,840
We've got too much weed and
had too much weed, you know,

1382
01:19:23,841 --> 01:19:27,290
and it's hard to see these cities and
they got nothing and these are the people

1383
01:19:27,291 --> 01:19:30,170
that are really voting is showing.
We don't really know the country's issues.

1384
01:19:30,610 --> 01:19:34,820
We see a thousand fucking cars and
20 weeks stores and shit and all the

1385
01:19:34,821 --> 01:19:36,650
restaurants around here a fucking open.

1386
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:40,280
You know when we went to
Pittsburgh dog on a Saturday night,

1387
01:19:40,670 --> 01:19:44,210
all of those businesses were Felice.
That's the truth.

1388
01:19:44,211 --> 01:19:45,620
Those are the people
that are really voting.

1389
01:19:46,070 --> 01:19:48,800
Those are the people that
are really paying attention
to what the fucking police

1390
01:19:48,801 --> 01:19:49,640
was.
Rough man.

1391
01:19:49,780 --> 01:19:53,540
We will leave maximum tour years ago
and I remember driving around the city

1392
01:19:53,560 --> 01:19:56,810
going while there's not a lot of hope and
this, it isn't. Not a lot going on here,

1393
01:19:56,840 --> 01:19:59,050
but the people are bad motherfucker fuck.

1394
01:19:59,051 --> 01:20:02,450
They just got so much that it's got a
lot of good people. Yeah, no, no, no.

1395
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:03,740
Ohio's always man.

1396
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:07,040
When I used to work for the sports
betting service day where the biggest

1397
01:20:07,290 --> 01:20:10,470
collection of gamblers really like,
and my Mac and my mind,

1398
01:20:10,490 --> 01:20:14,340
I'm like all of the sharpest guys in New
York and Vegas, they wiped their ass.

1399
01:20:14,700 --> 01:20:19,110
That whole, that whole Youngstown
with a hall of fame is all that shit.

1400
01:20:19,380 --> 01:20:23,490
That's big. Bookmaking Bay. You know,
you got to remember one thing, you guys,

1401
01:20:23,750 --> 01:20:26,720
the worst economy gets to more book Bacon.

1402
01:20:27,030 --> 01:20:29,020
Prostitution gets bigger and keep talking.

1403
01:20:30,390 --> 01:20:32,610
Drug sales go amazing.
You know?

1404
01:20:32,611 --> 01:20:35,550
That's why the mob and organized
crime will never go away.

1405
01:20:35,551 --> 01:20:38,440
They make more money when
the economy's bad. You know,

1406
01:20:38,441 --> 01:20:40,950
when we had a prohibition
and the Great Depression,

1407
01:20:41,310 --> 01:20:43,470
those monsters are making money,
selling booze.

1408
01:20:43,471 --> 01:20:46,500
People want to forget about their
fucking problems. It really is.

1409
01:20:46,620 --> 01:20:50,460
The worst economy is the more money
people have to take a gamble with it.

1410
01:20:50,490 --> 01:20:54,750
It's really weird to say there's more
gambling because people are desperate,

1411
01:20:54,751 --> 01:20:57,900
so people like, fuck it, I'm
gamble more. I will drink more.

1412
01:20:58,110 --> 01:21:03,060
The only fucking things that do not
get affected by the economy is crime.

1413
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:05,760
Think about it. What? Gambling
is not gonna affect it.

1414
01:21:05,761 --> 01:21:09,300
Vegas is still booming every
week we hear how, oh my God,

1415
01:21:09,510 --> 01:21:12,120
we went to Vegas and there was nobody
there. They keep building on it.

1416
01:21:12,121 --> 01:21:13,860
Then they get money from somewhere.

1417
01:21:14,370 --> 01:21:17,250
Somebody is putting that Betson and it
ain't me and you, but somebody is losing.

1418
01:21:17,490 --> 01:21:21,400
Yeah. They're just banking on the fact
that it's going to bounce back that night.

1419
01:21:21,420 --> 01:21:24,900
Then they stopped a lot of the
building. Now. I stopped a lot of it.

1420
01:21:24,901 --> 01:21:27,380
I mean everything.
They just nutty for awhile.

1421
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:31,430
They just opened a casino in Vegas when
we were there or I mean and Cleveland

1422
01:21:31,431 --> 01:21:35,090
while we were there that weekend and
that's like another way for them to try to

1423
01:21:35,091 --> 01:21:36,290
bounce back isn't how they,

1424
01:21:36,690 --> 01:21:40,800
Eva Longoria opened up like a spot.
A restaurant.

1425
01:21:40,830 --> 01:21:44,250
Didn't she open up like a
nightclub or some shit? Oh,
restaurant. It's still there.

1426
01:21:44,690 --> 01:21:47,930
Old Is it don't drive by them.
A basal.

1427
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:52,680
Is that what is Hollywood boulevard?
No, no, no, no, no. This is in Vegas. Oh

1428
01:21:55,170 --> 01:21:59,850
yeah. She had like a club or something
like, listen bro, I never figured out.

1429
01:22:00,030 --> 01:22:02,700
Somebody come with you. Joe Rogan
and Glen, I'm an open up a club.

1430
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:05,580
When you're a Vegas, come hang
out. We'll give you a kickback.

1431
01:22:05,820 --> 01:22:08,690
It's part of your club. You give
whatever percent they want. Right.

1432
01:22:08,970 --> 01:22:09,631
What's that called?

1433
01:22:09,631 --> 01:22:13,440
When you lend money and
there's no guarantee you
he'd give a certain amount of

1434
01:22:13,890 --> 01:22:16,090
the club. I mean, how much
do you make from that?

1435
01:22:16,550 --> 01:22:19,380
You got late teen fucking partners.
That's why I told you,

1436
01:22:19,470 --> 01:22:22,170
I told you specifically and I
know you don't like this shit,

1437
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:26,640
but you really got to watch the pimp
of Joe Davis. It's been out again.

1438
01:22:26,670 --> 01:22:29,430
I'm fucking HBO.
The sports thing they did for an hour.

1439
01:22:29,790 --> 01:22:33,840
That motherfucker had it so bad,
New York that he finally said fuck it.

1440
01:22:33,841 --> 01:22:37,180
We got to buy a bar. Like they
had a buy a bar, like they go,

1441
01:22:37,410 --> 01:22:40,560
they got sick and tired of going
out after games and spent the money.

1442
01:22:40,770 --> 01:22:44,310
Watch this documentary. It is brilliant.
I watched the guy the other day,

1443
01:22:44,311 --> 01:22:47,940
I got a quote, John have a bar in New
York, bought a bar in midtown Manhattan.

1444
01:22:48,210 --> 01:22:52,920
His fucking slogan was I liked my woman
blonde and I like my fucking scotch

1445
01:22:52,921 --> 01:22:55,230
black.
That was his shit dog.

1446
01:22:55,231 --> 01:23:00,231
You gotta Watch this thing and he's
this little town and he just went to New

1447
01:23:00,360 --> 01:23:04,290
York, Bro. I mean he got married
at like 42 because he had like,

1448
01:23:04,291 --> 01:23:07,600
his knee was bad as shit because
slave dateline, he had to,

1449
01:23:07,930 --> 01:23:12,220
well he would have never got married.
Like this guy was a fucking dicks liner.

1450
01:23:12,580 --> 01:23:15,610
He was slinging so much dick
that he had to buy a bar,

1451
01:23:16,210 --> 01:23:20,050
like to keep all his bitches in line and
then that they took the bar from him.

1452
01:23:20,051 --> 01:23:22,480
You got to watch the whole thing.
We'll, we'll, we'll get called.

1453
01:23:23,830 --> 01:23:27,500
He had acid and cvs.
What? The bar special,

1454
01:23:27,530 --> 01:23:31,270
but it's on HBO. He speaks on HBS
but on HBO for a couple of months.

1455
01:23:31,320 --> 01:23:32,020
And what's it called?

1456
01:23:32,020 --> 01:23:35,410
It's just called David naming and you're
going to love it because you remember

1457
01:23:35,411 --> 01:23:38,200
it's not about football,
it's about what this motherfucker,

1458
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:41,770
how crazy he was and how
he was just a good old boy.

1459
01:23:41,800 --> 01:23:46,120
But he owned New York Bro. He just
owned it. He just had it by the balls.

1460
01:23:46,390 --> 01:23:49,570
But then the fucking, they fucked
him. They said he had a close the bar.

1461
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:54,250
They made them close to bar because it's
because they said he had too many weird

1462
01:23:54,251 --> 01:23:58,720
people hanging out in there
too. Any weird people?

1463
01:23:58,870 --> 01:24:02,680
It's a bar. It's a bar, right? Nobody
had too many fucking weird people.

1464
01:24:02,681 --> 01:24:06,070
So watch this special. He really don't
like people that live above bars.

1465
01:24:06,071 --> 01:24:10,180
One of nutty way to live that as people
that live in front of it above like food,

1466
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:11,741
like fast food.

1467
01:24:11,741 --> 01:24:14,920
Like you know that grease smells going
to go right on Chinese restaurant

1468
01:24:15,220 --> 01:24:18,570
upstairs and there's something
dangerous about it though. You live on,

1469
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:21,100
you live on top of the bar
when you're a fucking hockey.

1470
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:25,660
That's the reason why you will live
in Jersey. You see on the New York,

1471
01:24:25,661 --> 01:24:30,370
UCL was bars at two dwellings over it.
Nobody decent lives over a bar.

1472
01:24:30,610 --> 01:24:33,220
They live over a bar because
they know that two minutes away,

1473
01:24:33,221 --> 01:24:34,220
no matter what happens,

1474
01:24:34,630 --> 01:24:39,010
I've only known a few people
that lived in midtown. You know,

1475
01:24:39,011 --> 01:24:42,280
like when I was struggling,
I only know a few people that were,

1476
01:24:42,281 --> 01:24:44,560
I got over their apartment and
get to see like how they lived.

1477
01:24:44,930 --> 01:24:48,670
But like living in cities like
New York, when you get like, like,

1478
01:24:48,820 --> 01:24:53,110
like studio apartments. That's
a weird life man. It's weird.

1479
01:24:53,260 --> 01:24:54,610
You enter into a door,

1480
01:24:54,670 --> 01:24:57,580
it opened the door and you got like
little space and it's like a tiny little

1481
01:24:57,581 --> 01:25:01,750
sink and there's like a little hot plate.
You know a lot of people, they're there,

1482
01:25:02,010 --> 01:25:05,590
they're living almost like in closets.
It's almost,

1483
01:25:05,630 --> 01:25:08,710
it's like a big closet,
a big closet already.

1484
01:25:08,711 --> 01:25:11,770
Steven's just got his first fridgerator
and it's not even a full size

1485
01:25:11,771 --> 01:25:15,040
refrigerator. It's one of those small
little frigerators and he's had one for,

1486
01:25:15,100 --> 01:25:19,300
he didn't have one for like almost a
year. Oh my god Bro. I'm advice that date.

1487
01:25:19,301 --> 01:25:23,920
This girl Julie Novak and she was a
Kansas girl that I met him in Colorado and

1488
01:25:23,921 --> 01:25:27,490
follow holding the restaurants. Why
did comedy yet and she was, you know,

1489
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:29,900
you meet people like I'm moving
to New York, I'm gung Ho.

1490
01:25:30,340 --> 01:25:33,010
She went to New York with her body.
It was a childhood dream.

1491
01:25:33,011 --> 01:25:34,930
She had to go to new year.
Archie's can Kansas.

1492
01:25:35,410 --> 01:25:37,780
They went to New York and
they moved to 15th Street,

1493
01:25:37,781 --> 01:25:42,781
up the block from Manhattan on the 15th
like in Ninth Avenue that they were

1494
01:25:42,971 --> 01:25:44,530
paying 1800 a month.

1495
01:25:44,531 --> 01:25:48,010
This is 1994 it was just what you said,

1496
01:25:48,610 --> 01:25:52,810
you opened the door. It was a
combination. One Room, 1800 a month,

1497
01:25:52,900 --> 01:25:56,920
1,801 room TV with a
fireplace that didn't work.

1498
01:25:57,280 --> 01:26:00,460
It was one room and then you open the
door and there was a little kitchen and

1499
01:26:00,461 --> 01:26:03,710
the bathroom was there. So when I had
a fucker, the roommate was in the,

1500
01:26:03,711 --> 01:26:07,850
she had a roommate. Oh,
because they couldn't afford,
oh 1800 she had a roommate,

1501
01:26:08,090 --> 01:26:10,940
so she would have to sleep in the fucking
living room and I would have fucked

1502
01:26:10,941 --> 01:26:14,790
her in the kitchen on the
floor. Oh my God. And we
couldn't fit your feet. You Go,

1503
01:26:14,850 --> 01:26:17,150
oh my God. Horrible. Horrible.

1504
01:26:17,151 --> 01:26:21,200
1800 a month just to fulfill her
dream to live in fucking New York.

1505
01:26:21,670 --> 01:26:25,160
Are you fucking crazy? But that was
good training. Why is that dream?

1506
01:26:25,161 --> 01:26:27,860
So people love that shit. I just want
to go to New York and then they get,

1507
01:26:27,861 --> 01:26:31,250
then they get mugged. When you look
up to a beautiful day, look down,

1508
01:26:31,251 --> 01:26:34,340
your bags are gone. Your
fucking Mama. What is it about,

1509
01:26:34,341 --> 01:26:38,090
I guess there's something about being
able to tell people that you live in

1510
01:26:38,091 --> 01:26:41,630
Manhattan, New York or whatever. Listen,

1511
01:26:41,690 --> 01:26:44,180
I told her a thousand times,
you gonna live in New York City.

1512
01:26:44,181 --> 01:26:47,120
If you don't live in like John Lennon
and the Dakota, go fuck your mother.

1513
01:26:47,710 --> 01:26:49,340
You didn't say go fuck yourself.
Yeah,

1514
01:26:49,610 --> 01:26:53,180
I'm going to struggle and drive down
and cat gentleman and lived at the

1515
01:26:53,181 --> 01:26:58,070
motherfucking Dakota and he walked around
and good, he got for shot, whatever,

1516
01:26:58,071 --> 01:27:01,490
but he walked good. Don't know. What
I'm saying is, you know he got shot.

1517
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:04,670
He didn't have a body guard
and he was just a regular guy.

1518
01:27:05,510 --> 01:27:08,540
He would walk through central park every
day and get freshly squeezed orange

1519
01:27:08,541 --> 01:27:13,250
juice and didn't give a fuck of it.
Cost $12 or not because he's John Lennon.

1520
01:27:14,060 --> 01:27:16,590
So a, the Dakota is like a
really nice place. It is.

1521
01:27:16,610 --> 01:27:19,910
Where else are you going to live?
Is that the nicest place that's topples?

1522
01:27:19,911 --> 01:27:23,840
Everything that's installed over anything?
Well I live at the plaza bitch.

1523
01:27:23,841 --> 01:27:28,110
I live with them motherfucking Dakota
and my name is Tom Petty. What is like,

1524
01:27:28,140 --> 01:27:29,900
what is that like? What
it is like? They're like,

1525
01:27:29,990 --> 01:27:32,360
what is like a real like go look it up.

1526
01:27:32,380 --> 01:27:34,790
The Cota or what's your
average property on the Dakota?

1527
01:27:34,791 --> 01:27:38,390
Cause I think you have to buy the condo
and they gotta be three, $4 million,

1528
01:27:38,391 --> 01:27:43,250
which is really a fucking apartment.
Which is right. I mean I can't,

1529
01:27:43,251 --> 01:27:45,200
I know he had two of them in there.
You know,

1530
01:27:45,201 --> 01:27:48,380
people will live with the Dakota
just like authors will get bank.

1531
01:27:48,660 --> 01:27:52,760
That's the type of people,
everything around it. The
code is expensive. You know,

1532
01:27:52,761 --> 01:27:56,100
if you live in the Dakotas cause you
fucking wow, I want a beautiful belt.

1533
01:27:56,150 --> 01:27:59,990
Oh it's beautiful dog. It's the shit.
That's the only way to fucking do it.

1534
01:28:00,380 --> 01:28:02,420
If you're going to do it,
it's incredible.

1535
01:28:02,450 --> 01:28:05,850
I'm going to live in Bronx or Brooklyn
or queens and drive in or take the a

1536
01:28:05,851 --> 01:28:10,610
train. Fuck you. I'm standing right there
under the code. Right. Central Park.

1537
01:28:10,670 --> 01:28:13,250
Isn't that weird? If you think
about it, what that building is,

1538
01:28:13,251 --> 01:28:17,100
it's like a safe for rich people, rich
people. It's like inside that safe,

1539
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:19,460
you cracked that safe open.
There's a bunch of rich people in there.

1540
01:28:20,930 --> 01:28:21,770
I mean that's what it is.

1541
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:24,710
And it's right there on the street where
all the poor people can drive by and

1542
01:28:24,711 --> 01:28:28,880
look at all the rich like inside there.
Well all they have to do is say, well,

1543
01:28:28,910 --> 01:28:29,960
you know what though,

1544
01:28:30,050 --> 01:28:35,050
you know society is functional and
there are police officers so it doesn't,

1545
01:28:35,390 --> 01:28:37,760
it's not feasible that we go in and
just take all the stuff out of there.

1546
01:28:37,761 --> 01:28:40,130
So we'll just leave it alone.
But they know where the stuff is.

1547
01:28:40,131 --> 01:28:43,490
The stuff is all in that
room, that big box, that's a,

1548
01:28:43,730 --> 01:28:48,710
that's a big mouse trap of rich
people. And so that is, it's a bank.

1549
01:28:48,980 --> 01:28:52,820
There's like little little pockets in
that bank and inside that you can get

1550
01:28:52,821 --> 01:28:56,840
money and there's jewelry and it's
expensive stuff all throughout that place

1551
01:28:57,500 --> 01:29:00,980
while you can't get in there now.
But if the shit hits the fan, yeah,

1552
01:29:01,080 --> 01:29:01,913
can get in there,
that'd be

1553
01:29:02,390 --> 01:29:05,410
easier. That's one of the first things
they're going to get into. You think so?

1554
01:29:05,470 --> 01:29:09,540
Fuck yeah. Fuck yeah. When the shit hits
the fan, why would you charge to Dakota?

1555
01:29:09,880 --> 01:29:12,360
You know the only thing that fuck you up,
his body guards.

1556
01:29:12,380 --> 01:29:15,240
You know how many dudes are rocking body
guards? Probably a lot in that place.

1557
01:29:16,230 --> 01:29:19,580
So there you got a bunch of armed killers
that are laying in wait things out of

1558
01:29:19,590 --> 01:29:20,910
the roof and all that shit.

1559
01:29:20,911 --> 01:29:25,230
But how long before they quit too and
get the fuck out of there after a couple

1560
01:29:25,230 --> 01:29:28,950
of weeks. This places abandoned.
What does it cost to live day Joe?

1561
01:29:28,951 --> 01:29:32,900
Just what's a property? The
color. Just shout real estate.

1562
01:29:32,910 --> 01:29:37,330
Just a mother. If it's even for a
sale. I wonder if he even, yeah,

1563
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:39,990
they gotta be for sale.
What are you talking about?

1564
01:29:40,140 --> 01:29:43,010
Did you see that some guy in
New York is selling as part?

1565
01:29:43,010 --> 01:29:44,910
It could be code Elliot and month,
a million a year.

1566
01:29:44,940 --> 01:29:49,230
What did you see that in a million a
year for a parking spot? Parking spot.

1567
01:29:49,260 --> 01:29:53,010
People think about it. They're
like, well, it's there.

1568
01:29:53,430 --> 01:29:56,520
It's close by.
I don't have to pay for fucking tickets.

1569
01:29:57,870 --> 01:30:02,700
That's hilarious. Apartments for
sale at the Dakota, New York City,

1570
01:30:02,701 --> 01:30:07,080
Manhattan Condos, one of the most famous
residents, buildings and all of New York.

1571
01:30:07,110 --> 01:30:10,410
It's the Dakota. It was a bold
building when it was first developed,

1572
01:30:10,830 --> 01:30:13,530
built so far north of the
pulse of the city. At the time,

1573
01:30:13,590 --> 01:30:16,260
citizens snickered and nicknamed it,
the Dakota,

1574
01:30:16,440 --> 01:30:19,800
a reference to the states
of north and South Dakota,

1575
01:30:19,890 --> 01:30:23,790
which were very far away from
New York City. Isn't that funny?

1576
01:30:23,820 --> 01:30:27,270
They nicknamed it the Dakota because they
thought it was too far away. Meanwhile,

1577
01:30:27,271 --> 01:30:30,660
this crazy city has built up so much
now it's actually in the heart of

1578
01:30:30,700 --> 01:30:32,270
everything.
Isn't that weird?

1579
01:30:32,280 --> 01:30:35,760
It's weird that New York shitty must've
been like way smaller back then.

1580
01:30:35,761 --> 01:30:40,660
I guess obviously it has to have been.
Yeah, I mean it's a crazy place, man. I,

1581
01:30:40,770 --> 01:30:41,640
every time I go there,

1582
01:30:41,641 --> 01:30:44,490
I fantasize about living there for
like short periods of time to heal,

1583
01:30:45,090 --> 01:30:49,680
but you know, I never, I don't
think I can do it. I'd freak out.

1584
01:30:49,710 --> 01:30:52,080
I'd have panic attacks.
It's too much. Too much.

1585
01:30:52,290 --> 01:30:55,800
You can't have like realize that that is,
you're getting interaction.

1586
01:30:55,860 --> 01:30:59,400
You're g you're, you're definitely
getting something off of those people.

1587
01:30:59,660 --> 01:31:00,810
You know?
I don't know what it is,

1588
01:31:00,811 --> 01:31:04,500
but I know there's a difference between
the way I feel when I'm standing on a

1589
01:31:04,501 --> 01:31:05,480
mountain and I,

1590
01:31:05,481 --> 01:31:10,470
I look out and I see fields and I see
like clouds and I see birds flying

1591
01:31:10,471 --> 01:31:10,980
overhead.

1592
01:31:10,980 --> 01:31:14,490
There's a different feeling than when
I'm on the four oh five when I'm in the

1593
01:31:14,491 --> 01:31:15,090
four or five.

1594
01:31:15,090 --> 01:31:20,070
There's a hive of humanity and there's
some residual effect that you get from

1595
01:31:20,071 --> 01:31:23,160
all these people. This is a
different feeling that you
get when you're in a city.

1596
01:31:23,300 --> 01:31:27,270
You're all there. There's an awareness
of, of humans are elective stress. Yeah.

1597
01:31:27,271 --> 01:31:30,750
There's something, it's like some, it's
pheromonal, whatever the fuck it is. It's,

1598
01:31:30,751 --> 01:31:33,000
it's in the air, man. It's, it's not,

1599
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:36,120
it's not as simple and as innocuous
as if you're not touching me,

1600
01:31:36,121 --> 01:31:38,040
you're not affecting me.
I think it's,

1601
01:31:38,310 --> 01:31:40,590
we're affected by our
environment some strange way.

1602
01:31:40,890 --> 01:31:44,130
So that's why I don't think I've got
to do in New York City when I was at my

1603
01:31:44,131 --> 01:31:47,790
mom's house this weekend. And she lives
in the middle of nowhere, like just farms,

1604
01:31:47,791 --> 01:31:52,740
like across the street from her is a
strawberry field and it's just in the

1605
01:31:52,741 --> 01:31:53,310
middle of nowhere.

1606
01:31:53,310 --> 01:31:56,280
And at night when I was sitting in my
car waiting to go inside her house,

1607
01:31:56,320 --> 01:32:00,040
I was just like,
it was so quiet and so like the stars and,

1608
01:32:00,230 --> 01:32:02,440
and it was just, it was like, this is,

1609
01:32:02,470 --> 01:32:06,120
I would not have any stress
if I got to come home to this.

1610
01:32:07,230 --> 01:32:09,080
It's crazy. Now you're, you're, you're

1611
01:32:09,570 --> 01:32:11,780
door. You hear cars driving
by your street. You know,

1612
01:32:11,781 --> 01:32:15,810
you might hear your neighbor wizards,
wizards are in the neighborhood.

1613
01:32:17,340 --> 01:32:18,360
You realize,
uh,

1614
01:32:18,720 --> 01:32:22,380
you know how much unnecessary
shit you have to deal with.

1615
01:32:22,830 --> 01:32:25,880
How much unnecessary stuff is
inside your head. You know what,

1616
01:32:25,930 --> 01:32:28,710
what it's all about.
You know, it's all about

1617
01:32:30,480 --> 01:32:34,230
life is supposed to be about enjoyment,
right? So to be about having a good time,

1618
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:38,250
it's not supposed to be about dealing
with all this extra curriculum nonsense.

1619
01:32:38,520 --> 01:32:42,450
And we shouldn't have to have so many
fucking people around us like we shouldn't

1620
01:32:42,451 --> 01:32:46,710
be living here. This is silly. Like
why? Why would this 20 million people?

1621
01:32:47,210 --> 01:32:50,050
What you find? It's really weird
when you talk to somebody like,

1622
01:32:51,330 --> 01:32:54,890
uh,
somebody who lives in New York and I'm so,

1623
01:32:54,891 --> 01:32:58,500
I'm trying to figure out a comic who
lives in New York that they just fucking

1624
01:32:58,501 --> 01:33:02,640
love it. They clip the badge and living
somewhere else. Some people fit into that.

1625
01:33:02,641 --> 01:33:06,660
A lot of people love it. You know? For
me, I don't mind. I fucking lives there.

1626
01:33:06,661 --> 01:33:10,500
He loves it. Who? Who's that Gaffigan?
He's got kids too and knew it was there.

1627
01:33:10,950 --> 01:33:13,890
You know, some people, they
find a good place there.

1628
01:33:14,010 --> 01:33:18,360
You know what I saw fucking crazy picture
of Anderson Cooper Anderson Cooper

1629
01:33:18,390 --> 01:33:20,710
lives in a firehouse.
Does it really? Yeah,

1630
01:33:20,770 --> 01:33:25,080
because it's busters converted firehouse.
I did. Yeah. Awesome. Is that, yeah,

1631
01:33:25,510 --> 01:33:28,650
it was a stupid fucking thread on my
board where people were talking about

1632
01:33:28,651 --> 01:33:31,590
Anderson Cooper being gay or who gives
a fuck. I mean, he's gay. Who Cares?

1633
01:33:31,591 --> 01:33:33,480
I see you want to fuck.
I'm always trying to fuck you.

1634
01:33:33,740 --> 01:33:36,270
You, can you, can you imagine
bringing a girl home and like,

1635
01:33:36,271 --> 01:33:39,600
like I'll be right down and like coming
down like on the, uh, Firepool where,

1636
01:33:39,950 --> 01:33:41,820
you know,
with a bottle of champagne,

1637
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:45,850
I guess you can,
you can see the actual place

1638
01:33:47,750 --> 01:33:49,490
that'd be the ultimate podcast studio.

1639
01:33:49,491 --> 01:33:53,300
Fucking making it out of a fire station
or something in the summer along those

1640
01:33:53,301 --> 01:33:54,140
lines.
Yeah.

1641
01:33:54,310 --> 01:33:58,630
You know, what would be the, the ultimate
would be that, uh, that missile silo,

1642
01:33:58,690 --> 01:34:02,860
that drug dealer had vice documentary,
I remember that.

1643
01:34:05,500 --> 01:34:09,520
He buys a four point $3
million in New York home.

1644
01:34:09,580 --> 01:34:14,080
Anderson Cooper Barney firehouse,

1645
01:34:15,310 --> 01:34:19,400
the 8,240 square foot home.
Wow.

1646
01:34:19,401 --> 01:34:23,920
That's a huge place in Manhattan at 84
west third street between Sullivan and

1647
01:34:23,921 --> 01:34:26,110
Thompson's,
which he purchased in September.

1648
01:34:26,111 --> 01:34:29,080
Both the original spiral
staircase brass fireplace.

1649
01:34:29,680 --> 01:34:33,700
So beautiful. It's pretty dope
fire stations. Pretty sweet. Well,

1650
01:34:33,701 --> 01:34:35,590
the crazy thing is, oh yeah, you,

1651
01:34:35,660 --> 01:34:40,570
you say what's crazy is it still says
fire patrol on it and it's his house now.

1652
01:34:40,720 --> 01:34:42,820
Yeah. I mean that's kind
of dangerous, isn't it?

1653
01:34:42,821 --> 01:34:46,450
Like people coming up to the place and be
like, help me, I need to drop off this.

1654
01:34:46,710 --> 01:34:49,510
I wonder how many babies he
gets dropped off. Oh God.

1655
01:34:49,810 --> 01:34:51,970
What if Anderson Cooper comes
out of his house every morning?

1656
01:34:51,971 --> 01:34:54,220
There's like two babies and he's like,
damn it again.

1657
01:34:54,280 --> 01:34:58,090
Four point $3 million.
This is why it's amazing it because

1658
01:34:58,100 --> 01:35:00,430
somebody is getting fucked by the fuck.

1659
01:35:01,160 --> 01:35:04,160
Pay 4.3 for fucking fire truck house.

1660
01:35:04,460 --> 01:35:08,650
See if they left the fucking fire engine
dance that's a pussy magnet or this

1661
01:35:08,660 --> 01:35:11,320
whole mango or whatever it is that
you're an asshole magnet. It's,

1662
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:15,240
I think it's Kim been converted. I mean,
I think inside it's pretty dope. Um,

1663
01:35:15,290 --> 01:35:19,770
it's um, it's more than 8,000 square
feet and that's a big fucking house.

1664
01:35:19,771 --> 01:35:22,760
Some New York City. Fuck yeah. In
New York City, that's an enormous,

1665
01:35:23,090 --> 01:35:25,370
but there's all these cool photos
of it. It's pretty dope, man.

1666
01:35:26,350 --> 01:35:27,260
You gotta be creative.

1667
01:35:27,261 --> 01:35:31,400
This is creative as it gets an
old fucking Fiat guaranteed.

1668
01:35:31,401 --> 01:35:35,180
I love to know if they left the poles
inside so he could fly down the fucking

1669
01:35:35,181 --> 01:35:36,380
pole. I know. I would.

1670
01:35:36,650 --> 01:35:39,980
That's part of the deal and I'd have
the Batman thing to shoot right back up.

1671
01:35:40,190 --> 01:35:43,130
You got it.
You got to fly down there.

1672
01:35:43,160 --> 01:35:46,190
You got to fly down the pole of the ball
and when people just got a garage man.

1673
01:35:46,220 --> 01:35:49,070
How about having a garage in New
York City? Who the fuck has a mirage?

1674
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:52,220
He bought a house with a garage and I
see I would live in New York City if I

1675
01:35:52,221 --> 01:35:53,420
could live like that.

1676
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:57,860
There was only one way to live in New
York guys and that's what a lot of fucking

1677
01:35:57,960 --> 01:36:01,880
gators because it cost a lot of
fucking genius to live in New York.

1678
01:36:02,690 --> 01:36:05,810
If you're super rich,
you could pull off live gives a fuck.

1679
01:36:05,811 --> 01:36:10,220
I take a cab everywhere,
freshly squeezed and Bagels are 20 bucks.

1680
01:36:10,221 --> 01:36:12,710
Who gives a full,
a lot of guys just have drivers,

1681
01:36:12,711 --> 01:36:15,290
so super rich dudes that
have like a pen houses there.

1682
01:36:15,410 --> 01:36:19,010
They just have like a driver. You know
what does it place? That's his house.

1683
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:21,970
Whose house?
Oh my God.

1684
01:36:21,980 --> 01:36:25,820
That's I think the people
that lived before or when it
was on sale. I'm guessing.

1685
01:36:27,200 --> 01:36:31,010
Oh my God,
that is fucking killer man.

1686
01:36:31,370 --> 01:36:34,960
What a killer house. Yeah, you
could put jacuzzis you can.

1687
01:36:36,200 --> 01:36:40,250
I've been to, I've been the one
incredible house in uh, in New York.

1688
01:36:40,251 --> 01:36:43,790
It was a friend of mine's dad had a,
a penthouse place.

1689
01:36:43,791 --> 01:36:48,050
I don't remember what homeboy did, but he
was very wealthy and we went to the, uh,

1690
01:36:48,140 --> 01:36:53,090
the top of this building and that's where
the apartment was in the fucking view

1691
01:36:53,091 --> 01:36:55,970
was insane.
It was insane.

1692
01:36:56,150 --> 01:36:59,330
He was just in the middle of
all these giant buildings.

1693
01:36:59,331 --> 01:37:04,070
They were all lit up and he had
this enormous glass opening.

1694
01:37:04,071 --> 01:37:06,410
Like his, his, his window.
He was on a corner,

1695
01:37:06,620 --> 01:37:09,860
he had a corner Penn House and
it was just, it was staggering.

1696
01:37:10,070 --> 01:37:13,550
Like you would look out there and you
just go, wow. Like you kind of get it.

1697
01:37:13,790 --> 01:37:16,790
It's like they get to live like
in a science fiction movie,

1698
01:37:17,030 --> 01:37:21,170
like every day they look out their window
and they're on the 90th floor or some

1699
01:37:21,171 --> 01:37:23,160
fucking building or whatever
the hell it is. You know,

1700
01:37:23,170 --> 01:37:25,130
I don't know what he even went to.
Highest building is there now,

1701
01:37:25,400 --> 01:37:25,971
but I mean if you,

1702
01:37:25,971 --> 01:37:28,790
if you're on the 50th 60th floor and
you're looking out and seeing all of

1703
01:37:28,791 --> 01:37:32,090
Manhattan and you're like in the
heat of it and it's kind of crazy.

1704
01:37:32,091 --> 01:37:33,620
Science Fiction Mad.
There's,

1705
01:37:33,710 --> 01:37:38,300
if you were like really into that like
man I could see but I think the baddest

1706
01:37:38,301 --> 01:37:42,950
house I have seen was a Maroon Creek,
maroon bells and Aspen,

1707
01:37:42,951 --> 01:37:43,784
Colorado.

1708
01:37:44,090 --> 01:37:47,030
We were building a house I was working
on for the electrician and the guy next

1709
01:37:47,031 --> 01:37:50,180
door we became friendly with him and
he was showing us, this guy was like,

1710
01:37:50,181 --> 01:37:53,030
can we produce it?
Don't ask me who the fuck it was.

1711
01:37:53,031 --> 01:37:55,070
It built the house from scratch.
But yeah,

1712
01:37:55,090 --> 01:37:58,950
I could tell that he was kind of off the
chain, like not a junkie and nothing.

1713
01:37:59,340 --> 01:38:01,770
He had manmade hot springs in his yard.

1714
01:38:02,430 --> 01:38:06,510
Like you would walk away under this under
the moonlight and he had them like 40

1715
01:38:06,511 --> 01:38:08,730
yards from his house.
He got like four different ones.

1716
01:38:09,120 --> 01:38:10,410
It was just amazing the view.

1717
01:38:10,411 --> 01:38:15,000
He had a Colorado looking down from one
of the top clips up in Maroon bells.

1718
01:38:15,001 --> 01:38:17,670
I mean it was fucking,
it would take your breath away.

1719
01:38:18,210 --> 01:38:21,690
It would really go like you would fucking,
it would take your breath away.

1720
01:38:21,691 --> 01:38:25,510
That's really weird to see that
user where the user work a lot.

1721
01:38:25,780 --> 01:38:29,160
To me a huge, you know, some
people don't, don't, don't care.

1722
01:38:29,210 --> 01:38:32,030
I'd rather just be in a nice
neighborhood or whatever I need.

1723
01:38:32,220 --> 01:38:35,610
I like looking out the window and seeing
shit when I look out the window and see

1724
01:38:35,611 --> 01:38:38,970
shit. It's inspiring. I that was like
one of the best parts of Colorado.

1725
01:38:38,971 --> 01:38:42,390
One of the best parts of being a look
out the window and just see the mountains

1726
01:38:42,391 --> 01:38:46,320
and the trees and the, you know, if you
could look over the ocean and you see the,

1727
01:38:46,340 --> 01:38:49,380
Oh that's like the best view where
you got a little bit of mountain,

1728
01:38:49,381 --> 01:38:51,210
a little bit of ocean,
you can just stand there.

1729
01:38:51,211 --> 01:38:55,530
It's like you're looking at the greatest
natural art ever created like me and

1730
01:38:55,610 --> 01:39:00,480
one of nature's most beautiful and
wondrous accomplishments is the beauty of

1731
01:39:00,481 --> 01:39:04,630
nature itself. Looking at mountains,
looking at the water, looking at,

1732
01:39:04,640 --> 01:39:07,740
especially at from afar,
looking at all of it together.

1733
01:39:07,830 --> 01:39:11,040
Like when you're flying into Hawaii and
you can't even believe how beautiful it

1734
01:39:11,041 --> 01:39:13,230
is. Like look at this
fucking place, look at it.

1735
01:39:13,500 --> 01:39:17,310
He'd like it charges you up just
with its own natural beauty.

1736
01:39:17,340 --> 01:39:22,140
But even Malibu has natural fo
Uli, Malibu, staggering beauty.

1737
01:39:22,141 --> 01:39:26,160
You know? Uh, Columbus. I
seen some shit. The trees,

1738
01:39:26,161 --> 01:39:29,760
the way they were cut. You ever look
at Columbus or a Malibu real estate?

1739
01:39:29,910 --> 01:39:33,060
Have you ever looked? No.
Jesus Christ. You just know.

1740
01:39:33,061 --> 01:39:36,480
You go online and like look Google like
Malibu real estate and see some of the

1741
01:39:36,481 --> 01:39:40,410
houses for like $60 million short.
But then they have,

1742
01:39:40,411 --> 01:39:43,020
where is all this money coming from?
Who are all these people?

1743
01:39:43,230 --> 01:39:45,840
How many rich people are there?
Like Jesus Christ.

1744
01:39:45,841 --> 01:39:48,320
Here's some people buying
up $60 million houses.

1745
01:39:48,350 --> 01:39:50,840
I know we talked about this a
long time ago on that podcast,

1746
01:39:50,870 --> 01:39:52,520
but I don't know if we
had video back then,

1747
01:39:52,521 --> 01:39:57,521
but like remember Mike Tyson's abandoned
mansion Suttington Ohio and like people

1748
01:39:59,420 --> 01:40:02,360
in Ohio would just break into
it because he abandoned it.

1749
01:40:02,390 --> 01:40:03,800
And so in there it was like,

1750
01:40:04,050 --> 01:40:08,420
it was still furnished and it was like
he just left it and it was really creepy.

1751
01:40:08,421 --> 01:40:12,940
Like, cause the water, the inside pool
had not been treated for a long time and,

1752
01:40:13,130 --> 01:40:17,480
and like look at this bathroom,
this is like a crazy shower. Wow.

1753
01:40:17,570 --> 01:40:18,403
And uh,

1754
01:40:18,860 --> 01:40:23,660
they had cages for those ages where the
animals in the back and then they had it

1755
01:40:23,661 --> 01:40:25,190
like his own basketball court,

1756
01:40:25,470 --> 01:40:30,170
teen Tyson and then number that was like
don king got them into all that team

1757
01:40:30,171 --> 01:40:34,130
Tyson Shit. And look how nice it is
outside in Ohio. Can you imagine that?

1758
01:40:34,310 --> 01:40:38,180
That would all be your,
it's pretty,

1759
01:40:38,260 --> 01:40:41,370
he just walked away from that.
Yeah, he just walked away from, Oh,

1760
01:40:41,371 --> 01:40:43,850
I'm sure he walked away.
Five of them like that.

1761
01:40:44,240 --> 01:40:48,540
I heard his house in Jersey was
fucking awesome. It probably, I dunno,

1762
01:40:48,750 --> 01:40:50,750
but like the website that that's from,

1763
01:40:50,751 --> 01:40:52,970
it's called Elicit Ohio is
one of my favorite websites.

1764
01:40:53,200 --> 01:40:55,750
It's just abandoned ship
in, in Ohio. Like look,

1765
01:40:55,760 --> 01:40:59,260
this old music school where it's just a
bunch of keyboards lined up and there's

1766
01:40:59,300 --> 01:41:02,710
no kind of a Ben Shit in Ohio. Oh yeah.
This is just a guy that fascinated,

1767
01:41:02,711 --> 01:41:03,190
you know,
he,

1768
01:41:03,190 --> 01:41:08,080
he's fascinated with it and he talks
about like the old penitentiary. Uh,

1769
01:41:08,270 --> 01:41:12,520
here's the old amusement parks and
stuff and air force air force town.

1770
01:41:13,090 --> 01:41:17,770
It's called Elicit Ohio.
I said Ohio. I L L. I C.

1771
01:41:17,771 --> 01:41:22,190
I t, ohio.com. Here's an air
force town, which is a frog.

1772
01:41:23,170 --> 01:41:24,003
And uh,

1773
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:26,680
well what does that have broken
rollercoaster it. What are we doing?

1774
01:41:27,140 --> 01:41:28,040
We're just watching things.

1775
01:41:30,110 --> 01:41:34,970
The conversation is actually a it to us,
like scrolling through it together,

1776
01:41:35,240 --> 01:41:36,740
but Mike Tyson,
his old house.

1777
01:41:36,770 --> 01:41:40,640
I wonder if you would be creeped out
if you bought it and you knew that like

1778
01:41:40,641 --> 01:41:44,470
Mike Tyson and just gorilla fuck
chicks in every room. The house. No,

1779
01:41:44,471 --> 01:41:47,720
it probably has a lot of positive
energy in it. You think so? Oh yeah.

1780
01:41:48,230 --> 01:41:53,210
Except for the Brad Pitt Energy.
Oh yeah, that's Taurus. Hilarious.

1781
01:41:56,120 --> 01:41:58,670
That's Joey Diaz is crumbling in the
background. Ladies and gentlemen,

1782
01:41:59,300 --> 01:42:01,200
what does that set up?

1783
01:42:01,270 --> 01:42:04,790
Pop Popcorn Mike Tyson have walked
away from I probably a bunch.

1784
01:42:04,791 --> 01:42:08,540
Right for seven.
I mean how much did he make?

1785
01:42:08,630 --> 01:42:11,540
He must've made like half a billion
dollars or something crazy. Right?

1786
01:42:12,730 --> 01:42:16,760
Cause they said, everybody says that Guy
Rob Don King. Yeah. Who knows? Who knows?

1787
01:42:16,761 --> 01:42:17,630
Who knows where it all went.

1788
01:42:17,780 --> 01:42:20,870
It's isn't it crazy though when you see
that story like repeated over and over

1789
01:42:20,871 --> 01:42:22,830
again throughout history.
I know guys,

1790
01:42:22,831 --> 01:42:25,400
when I got shit load of money and then
it all goes away and then they got none.

1791
01:42:25,850 --> 01:42:29,390
I mean it happens so often.
Well,

1792
01:42:29,410 --> 01:42:32,000
didn't end the way he was living so crazy.
He was given away.

1793
01:42:32,001 --> 01:42:35,150
Bentley's remember that he got an accident
with his Bentley and it gave it to

1794
01:42:35,151 --> 01:42:36,890
the cops and the cops got in trouble.

1795
01:42:37,160 --> 01:42:40,850
Like you can't like just accept a Bentley
from Mike Tyson while you're on the

1796
01:42:40,851 --> 01:42:45,710
job. He had no idea what they just
told to. He had 80 billion and go,

1797
01:42:45,830 --> 01:42:49,430
why can't he fucking just accept the
battling that's fucked up for the cops?

1798
01:42:49,580 --> 01:42:53,000
Cause the cop could have sold that Bentley
and not worked for like five years,

1799
01:42:53,210 --> 01:42:56,660
like quit. And I just got to live
off this battling money bitch.

1800
01:42:56,930 --> 01:43:00,230
And they sell that Bentley for quarter
million bucks that there was a lot of

1801
01:43:00,231 --> 01:43:03,830
money. Aren't they? Especially the
convertibles. She was so crazy.

1802
01:43:03,831 --> 01:43:05,090
You just crashed them
and giving them away.

1803
01:43:05,210 --> 01:43:08,950
He's going to do a one man
show now in Vegas. Yeah, I
heard he's already doing it.

1804
01:43:08,960 --> 01:43:11,750
I heard it's amazing. I he's already
doing it. I heard it's amazing.

1805
01:43:11,751 --> 01:43:12,531
It's amazing bro.

1806
01:43:12,531 --> 01:43:17,531
That guy has good tell a story like
I don't even get them into boxing and

1807
01:43:18,291 --> 01:43:22,430
fungus. What a great idea. He's a savage.
That guy's a fucking sad. But Joey is,

1808
01:43:22,431 --> 01:43:26,870
we need to get you a one man show and
he could just, you could just, uh,

1809
01:43:27,140 --> 01:43:29,120
would you be willing to do that?
I could do everything.

1810
01:43:29,180 --> 01:43:32,420
You just want to do a one man show night
in Vegas. I got plans already though.

1811
01:43:32,421 --> 01:43:33,141
Don't worry about it.

1812
01:43:33,141 --> 01:43:38,141
But he's the type of motherfucker that
you could just let him go for hours just

1813
01:43:39,231 --> 01:43:41,130
about the trainer yet.

1814
01:43:41,140 --> 01:43:45,200
And then he has six chapters
that you could go 12 hours on.

1815
01:43:45,860 --> 01:43:50,690
What's the original guy that adopted that
model? Then he went with Teddy Alice,

1816
01:43:51,050 --> 01:43:52,010
and then his days with

1817
01:43:52,010 --> 01:43:56,000
don king that his days with that
fucking skank from saved by the bell.

1818
01:43:56,270 --> 01:43:58,280
Then his two years in fucking prison.

1819
01:43:58,610 --> 01:44:01,640
Then when he came out to the
guys that killed brothers,

1820
01:44:01,641 --> 01:44:05,390
what's with the bow ties
and shit? Remember they were
guarding him for a while.

1821
01:44:05,420 --> 01:44:08,660
Then two years ago he smacking
somebody in a fucking movie.

1822
01:44:09,470 --> 01:44:12,860
You understanding the different extremes,
not the match. He lost a little girl,

1823
01:44:13,430 --> 01:44:17,720
not to mention these fucking Mike Tyson
and people look at him sometimes and you

1824
01:44:17,721 --> 01:44:21,530
may judge them, but that
guys, Jimmy is fucking deep,

1825
01:44:22,610 --> 01:44:25,220
deep, deep. And when you watch that,

1826
01:44:25,221 --> 01:44:28,070
we both watched that Tyson
biography together. Then we,

1827
01:44:28,430 --> 01:44:31,430
and he said some shit in the beginning
of that made you fucking think about my,

1828
01:44:31,530 --> 01:44:34,850
I remember watching a hotel room somewhere
and you said two or three things that

1829
01:44:34,851 --> 01:44:38,480
you're like, you know what the fuck you
look at that guy. He's as intelligent,

1830
01:44:38,481 --> 01:44:42,980
as deep as can be. He'll figure you the
fuck out. He was beaten fucking people up.

1831
01:44:42,981 --> 01:44:46,130
I just watched him against Irish Pat
Murphy or something, but he's a killer.

1832
01:44:46,160 --> 01:44:48,920
He was a good guy, was a killer
when he was at his best. I mean we,

1833
01:44:48,921 --> 01:44:51,740
we talk about him all the time because
when anyone is at his best, it was like a,

1834
01:44:51,741 --> 01:44:54,230
it was a force of nature
who said he just had an,

1835
01:44:54,490 --> 01:44:58,160
whenever someone who can can summon up
intensity than other people just can't

1836
01:44:58,161 --> 01:44:58,521
match.

1837
01:44:58,521 --> 01:45:02,720
It's always fascinating to watch a guy
who just raises it to the next level and

1838
01:45:02,721 --> 01:45:05,840
that's clearly what he did. He came
along and just took it to another place.

1839
01:45:05,841 --> 01:45:06,980
Like everybody was like,
Whoa,

1840
01:45:06,981 --> 01:45:10,880
we never seen intensity like these eight
chapters right in front of our eyes.

1841
01:45:11,240 --> 01:45:14,600
How many boxes do you know that went to
prison in the middle of their career or

1842
01:45:14,930 --> 01:45:17,550
football players and now
they're making movies.

1843
01:45:17,550 --> 01:45:21,010
Is this got him going to prison under
like some pretty shady circumstances?

1844
01:45:21,050 --> 01:45:22,850
He went in there for fucking rape.
Yeah.

1845
01:45:22,860 --> 01:45:27,830
I'd go with a girl who had it all ready
and had falsely accused someone of rape.

1846
01:45:28,190 --> 01:45:33,190
She was only like 19 years old and she
had already before him falsely accuse

1847
01:45:33,231 --> 01:45:36,200
somebody and they still didn't
get them off and their, their,

1848
01:45:36,201 --> 01:45:41,090
their defense was so crazy. It was
like, what do you expect him to do?

1849
01:45:41,300 --> 01:45:43,910
Look at who he is.
She should have known.

1850
01:45:44,090 --> 01:45:45,890
She should have known that if
she's going to be alone with him,

1851
01:45:45,900 --> 01:45:50,180
he was going to fuck her. Like
that was the defense, which is,

1852
01:45:50,630 --> 01:45:51,990
you can't say that that guy,

1853
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:56,360
that guy is getting thrown
away more money thrown away.

1854
01:45:56,750 --> 01:46:01,510
He scrolled away more money than a small
country has that back account. Oh yeah.

1855
01:46:01,520 --> 01:46:05,060
He's showed us through more money than
10 people live through in a fucking

1856
01:46:05,061 --> 01:46:05,894
lifetime.

1857
01:46:05,990 --> 01:46:09,320
You know how interesting that guy
would be to get them stoned by mistake.

1858
01:46:09,740 --> 01:46:11,300
Like just to give him a hit a fucking so,

1859
01:46:11,301 --> 01:46:15,200
oh Gee Kush and let that motherfucker go.
Just let him go.

1860
01:46:15,260 --> 01:46:19,340
Just tell him just about three of his
boxing fights and what led up to it. Yeah.

1861
01:46:19,370 --> 01:46:22,850
What happened in Japan against
Buster Douglas, you know, so I,

1862
01:46:22,860 --> 01:46:25,880
I wish him all the luck in the world
cause that's a true motherfucker right

1863
01:46:25,881 --> 01:46:30,470
there. We watch that guy
come, go, come, go again.

1864
01:46:31,370 --> 01:46:32,990
His daughter had died two years ago.

1865
01:46:33,770 --> 01:46:37,520
Not many people can bounce that
back from that Bro. You know?

1866
01:46:37,521 --> 01:46:40,170
And he's really trying, you know,
I used to see him at the YMC,

1867
01:46:40,850 --> 01:46:43,640
but for all the fucked up shit I used to
see him try because they had them in a

1868
01:46:43,641 --> 01:46:44,474
rehab up there.

1869
01:46:44,870 --> 01:46:48,410
He was always pulling over the ass and
teaching a kid how to throw a punch.

1870
01:46:48,411 --> 01:46:52,040
Right. You know what I'm saying, Dawg?
And that's what it's all about it.

1871
01:46:52,041 --> 01:46:56,910
He would always stop and walk past the
boxing thing and if he sees somebody,

1872
01:46:57,120 --> 01:47:01,420
he'd go and he'd go like, let me
help you. He would hold the bag fee.

1873
01:47:01,600 --> 01:47:05,460
Well fucking champion all the bag
for you one time. He can still

1874
01:47:05,540 --> 01:47:08,300
talk to, he doesn't have problems
forming sentences or anything.

1875
01:47:08,301 --> 01:47:11,360
He doesn't have like,
you know, speech issues.

1876
01:47:12,370 --> 01:47:16,250
So if you're got to do a one man show,
that's the last thing you need. You know,

1877
01:47:16,280 --> 01:47:19,160
that's a satisfying about boxers,
man. As you'll watch a great one.

1878
01:47:19,370 --> 01:47:22,340
And then you watch him in an interview
later in his career and you hear him

1879
01:47:22,341 --> 01:47:24,500
slurring his words and
you're like, man, he paid,

1880
01:47:24,890 --> 01:47:29,360
he paid a big price for that life,
that wildlife or has paid a big price.

1881
01:47:29,690 --> 01:47:32,870
You know? And now we're sitting here
watching it. But some people, man,

1882
01:47:32,871 --> 01:47:34,790
that must be maddening to know that,
you know,

1883
01:47:35,150 --> 01:47:39,050
your career has forced you to in your
later years not being able to communicate.

1884
01:47:39,051 --> 01:47:39,740
Right.

1885
01:47:39,740 --> 01:47:43,100
But do they know it? They know
that they can't communicate, right?

1886
01:47:43,520 --> 01:47:46,790
Well they just want what's in their mind?
What's their head? Well, I think this

1887
01:47:47,030 --> 01:47:51,840
drums and there is a spectrum rather.
I think there's a broad range of, of,

1888
01:47:51,960 --> 01:47:56,420
of brain damage. But I think a lot of
them don't know what the fuck is going on.

1889
01:47:56,421 --> 01:47:59,630
Like that was the thing about the HPO a
football special and they were talking

1890
01:47:59,631 --> 01:48:00,930
about concussions.
Uh,

1891
01:48:01,280 --> 01:48:04,340
they showed a lot of these guys later
in their life and they didn't know what

1892
01:48:04,341 --> 01:48:07,430
was going on. These poor guys were
like delirious. They just literally,

1893
01:48:07,431 --> 01:48:10,250
their wives just guide them
all around their wives.

1894
01:48:10,520 --> 01:48:13,700
It was like they had an a child, you know,
they had a child had to take care of,

1895
01:48:14,210 --> 01:48:17,120
you know, so there's, there's
a broad range of trauma

1896
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:22,230
related to that, bro, with football. I
don't blame it all on the fucking, uh,

1897
01:48:22,950 --> 01:48:23,783
the head shrub.

1898
01:48:24,390 --> 01:48:29,390
I blame it on your body getting hit
by a truck for fucking 10 years.

1899
01:48:31,200 --> 01:48:34,920
You're getting hit by a
truck seven months of a year.

1900
01:48:35,850 --> 01:48:39,870
That's reality. You know, how
much abuse can your spine take?

1901
01:48:40,650 --> 01:48:44,420
How much abuse can you Oregon's
take? It depends. Fucking shops.

1902
01:48:44,660 --> 01:48:47,250
You have the shot that I would give
you if you're standing like this,

1903
01:48:47,251 --> 01:48:47,911
getting the ball.

1904
01:48:47,911 --> 01:48:52,911
You know when a guy waiting and he gets
it and I come from the all the writing,

1905
01:48:54,110 --> 01:48:57,990
I give you the kidney. So I don't
blame it all on the fucking head shots.

1906
01:48:58,410 --> 01:49:01,920
It's gotta be a motherfucker to put
your head down and hit somebody.

1907
01:49:02,310 --> 01:49:07,080
Even when it does it your spine,
something's gotta be Bro. That controls,

1908
01:49:07,350 --> 01:49:10,830
you know all the electrodes that
controls all this shit in your fucking,

1909
01:49:10,860 --> 01:49:13,920
your body. A little spine. You
know, I've told you many times,

1910
01:49:13,921 --> 01:49:17,430
the last two years before I stopped
doing blow at the end of the night and my

1911
01:49:17,431 --> 01:49:21,030
fucking spine,
but the top of my fucking neck with her,

1912
01:49:21,031 --> 01:49:22,640
it would give me little voltage like,

1913
01:49:24,320 --> 01:49:28,260
so I knew it was starting to fuck shit
up and you can't talk. I can't imagine.

1914
01:49:28,320 --> 01:49:32,100
But I want to know if they know what
they're going through that I want to know.

1915
01:49:32,101 --> 01:49:34,200
If you sit them down and go,
how do you feel?

1916
01:49:34,510 --> 01:49:38,460
And if they would say to you at times,
I want to express myself and I can't.

1917
01:49:39,410 --> 01:49:42,050
Yeah, I'm sure they can't. I'm sure
that's exactly what they were telling you.

1918
01:49:42,620 --> 01:49:46,220
That's gotta be a terrible fucking
feeling man. Like he's gonna be terrible.

1919
01:49:46,730 --> 01:49:48,220
I see something like Vinny Corto

1920
01:49:48,220 --> 01:49:52,810
who I know he's been punched in the
head lady fucking times. You know,

1921
01:49:53,170 --> 01:49:54,520
I could talk to Vinny for hours.

1922
01:49:54,521 --> 01:49:58,270
I talked to him last week for like 45
minutes and he'll go from sentence to

1923
01:49:58,271 --> 01:50:02,380
sentence and it's amazing how he remembers
certain things and I'm very impressed

1924
01:50:02,381 --> 01:50:04,600
by it. But at the same time when
I hang up the phone with them,

1925
01:50:05,110 --> 01:50:08,060
I'm sure there's another thousand
things that he's forgotten, right?

1926
01:50:08,350 --> 01:50:09,880
For the 20 that he's remembered,

1927
01:50:10,090 --> 01:50:14,200
he's really forgotten a thousand so I
might think he's sharp and that that's all

1928
01:50:14,201 --> 01:50:17,850
he remembers is a handful of
that stuff yet compromised.

1929
01:50:17,920 --> 01:50:22,120
You know there's a certain amount of
compromise you just, you're going to get,

1930
01:50:22,121 --> 01:50:27,121
if you were involved in kickboxing
or contact sports or football,

1931
01:50:27,401 --> 01:50:30,430
any anytime where you're getting head
collisions over and over again you're

1932
01:50:30,431 --> 01:50:31,690
going to get,
you got to pay a price.

1933
01:50:31,870 --> 01:50:33,310
It's like how much is the
price you're gonna pay?

1934
01:50:33,460 --> 01:50:36,100
Is it just going to be like
a weird little achy thing?

1935
01:50:36,280 --> 01:50:39,700
Like you know like you might get like a
hurt wrist is going to be like that and

1936
01:50:39,701 --> 01:50:41,290
your brain's like,
I that's kind of annoying.

1937
01:50:41,291 --> 01:50:43,000
But not that big a deal
is going to be that.

1938
01:50:43,030 --> 01:50:46,090
Or is it going to be something really
serious when your mouth doesn't work right

1939
01:50:46,091 --> 01:50:50,680
or you can't formulate certain words where
you struggle to try to put together a

1940
01:50:50,681 --> 01:50:53,500
sentence and you forget what you were
talking about right in the middle of the

1941
01:50:53,501 --> 01:50:57,580
sentence and you're not even,
hi, nice. It's really weird how

1942
01:50:59,980 --> 01:51:04,980
I know from two ways I know from riding
a motorcycle who and falling off of

1943
01:51:05,441 --> 01:51:06,730
banging my head a few times.

1944
01:51:07,150 --> 01:51:11,260
I know from getting hit in the head a
few times and I also know like how you

1945
01:51:11,261 --> 01:51:14,440
feel the next day you get hit in the
fucking head, whatever used to it,

1946
01:51:15,060 --> 01:51:17,560
then you feel terrible is what you,
you feel.

1947
01:51:17,560 --> 01:51:21,660
You do feel a darkness and just call. It
feels dark. It feels like there's no sun.

1948
01:51:21,670 --> 01:51:22,503
That side.

1949
01:51:22,660 --> 01:51:25,360
You know when you get clocked in the
head for a couple of days and you see

1950
01:51:25,361 --> 01:51:28,120
things, that's a good way of
putting it. It's fucking crazy.

1951
01:51:28,121 --> 01:51:30,580
I know when I got clocked in the head,
it scared the shit out on me. You know?

1952
01:51:30,581 --> 01:51:34,470
I survived. I lived to
tell the story. But you,

1953
01:51:34,490 --> 01:51:37,420
you know that it's not right for you.
You said you'd know all that.

1954
01:51:37,630 --> 01:51:41,560
What I'm doing is that fucking healthy
because this isn't normal for me to feel

1955
01:51:41,561 --> 01:51:46,010
this way. You know? It's not what the
concussions, it's not only the, the, the,

1956
01:51:46,030 --> 01:51:49,300
the words and your memory,
it's also your mood.

1957
01:51:49,810 --> 01:51:51,240
It controls your fucking moods.

1958
01:51:51,330 --> 01:51:55,450
I could control whether or not you ice
yourself or you fucking don't know how

1959
01:51:55,451 --> 01:51:59,680
you live. You know? That's all the shit.
That's enough. Every brain, you know,

1960
01:51:59,980 --> 01:52:01,960
I don't know what they are,
but you know, different,

1961
01:52:01,961 --> 01:52:05,500
like somebody was saying that the front
of the brain controls your wrangler and

1962
01:52:05,501 --> 01:52:08,620
that the Buddhist belief for years,
if you meditate through meditation,

1963
01:52:08,890 --> 01:52:11,260
you could get through that part.
I'm just giving an example,

1964
01:52:11,470 --> 01:52:13,510
but I think that affects
a fucking lot of things.

1965
01:52:13,780 --> 01:52:18,490
Your mood and your depression or
your and to the fucking has to men.

1966
01:52:18,850 --> 01:52:21,880
And that's why when they talk about
football plate, they bro, when, when uh,

1967
01:52:22,150 --> 01:52:24,890
who kicks hard, the UFC cro, cop waving,

1968
01:52:24,891 --> 01:52:26,680
when cro cop kicks you
in the fucking liver,

1969
01:52:26,681 --> 01:52:28,610
you're not going to feel that for a
couple of weeks. And should I have,

1970
01:52:28,620 --> 01:52:32,540
I got to do something to your insides
because you kicking me over here.

1971
01:52:32,541 --> 01:52:35,590
It's got a borrow from something.
You don't have those fucking kicks.

1972
01:52:35,591 --> 01:52:38,200
Got To do something. That is a thing that
people don't think about. I was like,

1973
01:52:38,201 --> 01:52:39,370
the damage to your organs,

1974
01:52:39,400 --> 01:52:43,390
Jesus Christ fuck packs from whether
football or kickboxing or whatever.

1975
01:52:43,700 --> 01:52:46,340
Now you've got to think about
that because you can't see it.

1976
01:52:46,341 --> 01:52:48,200
So you just assume
everything's okay in there,

1977
01:52:48,650 --> 01:52:53,540
but you know like someone's Shin slamming
in the rib cage and fucking rattling

1978
01:52:53,541 --> 01:52:57,020
all your shit full blast
into your rib cage. Really?

1979
01:52:58,040 --> 01:53:01,820
Jesus Christ. You know how much,
how many of those can you take?

1980
01:53:02,030 --> 01:53:04,040
What's going on inside there?
You know,

1981
01:53:04,430 --> 01:53:08,240
they was showing up is everything on the
other fell. When we were in Pittsburgh,

1982
01:53:08,270 --> 01:53:12,170
I was watching and I have to do TV was
I'm trying to write whatever and that was

1983
01:53:12,171 --> 01:53:16,270
showing a Earl Campbell and that would
show the best 10 power backs of Walnut.

1984
01:53:16,550 --> 01:53:20,150
And they showed Earl Campbell playing
against some team and he had a plague of

1985
01:53:20,160 --> 01:53:22,820
something Solomon and they said,
look at the shot,

1986
01:53:22,821 --> 01:53:25,510
but it gives him what had by mistake,
he hit him with a,

1987
01:53:25,511 --> 01:53:30,080
the in the solar plexus pick about
it right here by mistake like he was,

1988
01:53:30,170 --> 01:53:32,810
he went to tackle them and I
tripped over play his foot.

1989
01:53:33,290 --> 01:53:37,260
So the momentum and him coming
around the D was right. That band,

1990
01:53:37,760 --> 01:53:41,000
oh my God. But you just seen it. It
was like hidden Carbonell Campbell.

1991
01:53:41,120 --> 01:53:42,570
And you'll come and as,

1992
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,590
as he's coming around band,
it was just, it was perfect.

1993
01:53:48,170 --> 01:53:51,130
The fucking written this
year and this motherfucker,

1994
01:53:51,190 --> 01:53:55,070
you just seeing his arms go like this bro.
Like everything.

1995
01:53:56,720 --> 01:53:59,960
Space Cake. Don't give him
more. When are you doing?

1996
01:54:01,060 --> 01:54:05,860
He can't take all this. No one
can take all this. Just know.

1997
01:54:05,920 --> 01:54:08,890
He just seen a whole bag of popcorn la.
Incredible.

1998
01:54:08,900 --> 01:54:13,250
Because it's what amateurs shift that
your shit when you call me crying now,

1999
01:54:13,251 --> 01:54:18,170
an hour from now, Joe Rogan, you should
see I want to talk to you Dana dear on.

2000
01:54:18,190 --> 01:54:22,120
We did this podcast every day and she ate
a whole bag of that popcorn and by the

2001
01:54:22,121 --> 01:54:24,610
end of it she was so
calm she couldn't even,

2002
01:54:24,790 --> 01:54:26,920
I had to call her cause I
was so worried about her.

2003
01:54:26,921 --> 01:54:30,880
Like we stayed here for a bit
until she came down. But wow. Yeah.

2004
01:54:30,881 --> 01:54:32,890
You've got to get someone some
coffee or something, right? Yeah,

2005
01:54:32,920 --> 01:54:37,000
he'd do what he do. You just got to
ride it out. Yeah. There's nothing else.

2006
01:54:37,050 --> 01:54:41,560
Let's go ride it out. It's like a
Piss test for you. Fucking amateurs.

2007
01:54:41,590 --> 01:54:45,610
Don't be playing with those edibles.
Dangerous. That of bolts are danger,

2008
01:54:45,611 --> 01:54:49,930
my friend that is not regular weed folks.
That's not regular week.

2009
01:54:49,960 --> 01:54:52,570
You gotta you gotta understand that it
was going to affect you a lot differently

2010
01:54:52,571 --> 01:54:56,620
when you eat it. I was just
hungry. That's the only reason

2011
01:54:58,200 --> 01:55:02,230
I'm going to be talking to two fucking
space to that 40 minutes. Fuck that.

2012
01:55:02,680 --> 01:55:03,700
Fuck that dog.

2013
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:07,150
I haven't even a level a couple of days
is Columbus and he just ate a whole bag

2014
01:55:07,151 --> 01:55:09,710
of popcorn and one of those you're
going to be crying and one hour, dude,

2015
01:55:09,810 --> 01:55:13,450
remember those cookies?
I gave us a in Columbus,

2016
01:55:13,451 --> 01:55:16,060
Ohio and you ate them right
before you went on stage.

2017
01:55:16,061 --> 01:55:17,950
Did you start feeling it while you're on?

2018
01:55:18,070 --> 01:55:22,090
I think I remember you saying something
about it. I felt a little bit on.

2019
01:55:22,091 --> 01:55:25,390
So you know whenever you eat another
boy and you go on stage, you go to yoga,

2020
01:55:25,391 --> 01:55:28,600
you go to Jujitsu or whatever
the edible sits in you.

2021
01:55:28,601 --> 01:55:30,700
But once that adrenaline
mixes with the edible,

2022
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,190
you've got a different type
of fucking savage in that.

2023
01:55:33,430 --> 01:55:37,690
How about our friend that gave us those
cookies in Chicago and you had a mild

2024
01:55:37,691 --> 01:55:42,460
heart attack from
what happened was,

2025
01:55:42,461 --> 01:55:44,370
this was a couple of years ago,

2026
01:55:44,640 --> 01:55:47,790
we did the one Chicago Club.
Well, that's very a white.

2027
01:55:48,080 --> 01:55:51,860
My 40th birthday he came
up to and it was crazy.

2028
01:55:51,861 --> 01:55:54,390
This guy gave me these fucking
cookies that were a rapper.

2029
01:55:54,840 --> 01:55:59,490
He brought them and I ate two of them.
They're life changing cookies. Oh my God.

2030
01:55:59,491 --> 01:56:04,290
The next day, the next day
I had like an off beat my
fucking heart. Like my, uh, my,

2031
01:56:04,320 --> 01:56:05,850
I had like a heart murmur,
you know,

2032
01:56:06,240 --> 01:56:09,030
three days later I went to the doctor and
they're like, yeah, you had something.

2033
01:56:09,420 --> 01:56:14,060
What the Fuck Julie? Oh my God, you
gotta file artist. I'm telling you, dude,

2034
01:56:14,090 --> 01:56:17,020
they were not regular cookies.
I don't know them later.

2035
01:56:17,100 --> 01:56:21,000
I don't know what to after he put
those weren't regular cookies.

2036
01:56:21,870 --> 01:56:25,760
There's a point, there's a point
where I could tell what they were.

2037
01:56:25,770 --> 01:56:28,620
These cookies I was eating for a while.
I'm not going to say from what place.

2038
01:56:29,060 --> 01:56:31,600
I'm not a year later that
the dude was putting volumes,

2039
01:56:33,070 --> 01:56:35,700
these cookies with doing something to me

2040
01:56:37,910 --> 01:56:41,280
that these cookies with doing something
to me that nothing else was doing.

2041
01:56:41,520 --> 01:56:43,260
I been around the block
so I could feel it.

2042
01:56:43,560 --> 01:56:45,390
I know the difference
between eating like a cookie.

2043
01:56:45,391 --> 01:56:47,250
And so he knew that he was
going to get people hooked.

2044
01:56:47,270 --> 01:56:50,750
He was saying these are the
strongest fucking things guarantee.

2045
01:56:50,770 --> 01:56:54,110
And then when they got a call one
day, that whole, I got a call with me,

2046
01:56:54,140 --> 01:56:59,070
went to the fucking hospital. What in
the ass hole? The guy was like, Bro,

2047
01:56:59,071 --> 01:57:02,430
you don't have THC.
I know you can't be this asleep.

2048
01:57:02,431 --> 01:57:05,550
Like this whole wow, that's, yeah.

2049
01:57:05,560 --> 01:57:10,320
Well that's the thing about
having marijuana all shady
and semi illegal the way

2050
01:57:10,321 --> 01:57:14,340
it is. You know, there's a lot
of fucking disreputable folks.

2051
01:57:14,530 --> 01:57:17,010
You're going to get involved in
this just to make money. You know?

2052
01:57:17,020 --> 01:57:20,570
Think about like pots. Good
man. Yeah. Pot's good. But he,

2053
01:57:20,580 --> 01:57:21,540
when people are selling it,

2054
01:57:21,570 --> 01:57:23,400
you're gonna get people that
are just trying to make money.

2055
01:57:23,401 --> 01:57:26,310
They're not like pot advocates per se.

2056
01:57:26,430 --> 01:57:28,350
Some of them are just in
the business to make money.

2057
01:57:28,580 --> 01:57:31,070
Business people stick
around for that long, right,

2058
01:57:31,230 --> 01:57:34,530
because you've got to put too much
wheat to kill the radio to, well,

2059
01:57:34,540 --> 01:57:36,810
the whole thing is it's gotta
be a one shot operation,

2060
01:57:37,020 --> 01:57:39,120
so it's gotta be a store
that buys three pounds.

2061
01:57:39,121 --> 01:57:42,430
They trim it and whatever they have
leftover, they make the edibles with.

2062
01:57:42,480 --> 01:57:45,420
If you go with to buy wheat to make
other bulls, you're going to lose money.

2063
01:57:45,690 --> 01:57:46,680
It's not going to work for you.

2064
01:57:46,681 --> 01:57:50,700
Make it from the trimmings are the fucking
seeds and all the fucking stems and

2065
01:57:50,701 --> 01:57:52,230
that's how you do it.
That's how you do it.

2066
01:57:52,260 --> 01:57:56,340
That's to do it to be profitable because
it's once doesn't have the same impact.

2067
01:57:56,610 --> 01:57:58,800
What do you mean? Yeah, yeah,
it's all the same strength.

2068
01:57:58,801 --> 01:58:01,700
It's all the same strengths.
The stems have the same amount of Tsh,

2069
01:58:01,820 --> 01:58:03,300
but all the leaves and all that Shit.

2070
01:58:03,301 --> 01:58:06,900
You put it with the butter and you still
get the butter with the same high THC

2071
01:58:06,901 --> 01:58:10,380
ratio really sustain from the leaves.
They trim it with the leaves.

2072
01:58:10,381 --> 01:58:13,210
That's all made from leaves dog, you
know when they tell you, oh yeah,

2073
01:58:13,220 --> 01:58:13,960
it's way through.

2074
01:58:13,960 --> 01:58:16,980
They'd take a beautiful bugs grow
and then they take the leaves.

2075
01:58:16,981 --> 01:58:19,630
They trim it when you buy. Okay. Let
me give you an example. That grind,

2076
01:58:19,690 --> 01:58:22,680
you have that grind that
you have has two pieces.

2077
01:58:23,010 --> 01:58:26,610
It has a piece for the weed and other
little weed. It has a piece for Kush.

2078
01:58:26,640 --> 01:58:31,320
What does it call it Kiki? Kiki. Okay.
See how much Keith you got in there.

2079
01:58:31,620 --> 01:58:34,020
There's a lot. Is there a lot. Okay.

2080
01:58:34,290 --> 01:58:36,780
This is what you do when
you go to a weed store.

2081
01:58:36,781 --> 01:58:41,530
Now before they give you that weed, they
beat the kief off the week. They do.

2082
01:58:41,680 --> 01:58:43,930
That's how they sell kief you bring,

2083
01:58:43,960 --> 01:58:48,910
we'd evolved from a weed store
now there's no keef on it. Yeah.

2084
01:58:49,060 --> 01:58:51,710
That you could get 25 grand for
that shit dirty at grand. Yeah.

2085
01:58:52,290 --> 01:58:53,520
The place next door.

2086
01:58:53,521 --> 01:58:57,150
It's one of those schools that teaches
you how to grow weed and like you can

2087
01:58:57,151 --> 01:59:00,600
have like like up to seven plants or
something like that and they and that you

2088
01:59:00,601 --> 01:59:02,970
use there. There are lighting
and just go, you know,

2089
01:59:02,971 --> 01:59:06,090
a couple of days a week or whatever to
check on your plants. It's like kind of,

2090
01:59:06,270 --> 01:59:07,890
it's kind of cool,
but they just bought a,

2091
01:59:07,891 --> 01:59:12,891
an extraction machine and so now they
can extract the wheat into like the weed

2092
01:59:13,261 --> 01:59:14,670
juice where you can just

2093
01:59:14,860 --> 01:59:19,060
this guy show up. This guy.
I love it. Yeah. I love y'all

2094
01:59:20,810 --> 01:59:21,340
Brandon.

2095
01:59:21,340 --> 01:59:26,340
Next door he showed me he has a syringe
and it's just a syringe of like liquid

2096
01:59:26,650 --> 01:59:27,880
and you just so I can just drop it.

2097
01:59:27,920 --> 01:59:29,490
No,
I not fucking boring an intravenous.

2098
01:59:29,880 --> 01:59:32,320
How long before someone takes
that intervene? No, no, no.

2099
01:59:33,340 --> 01:59:36,870
It's a syringe just to drop like a
little drop on a, on, on your nugs. Oh,

2100
01:59:36,871 --> 01:59:37,860
I understand what you're saying,

2101
01:59:37,861 --> 01:59:41,280
but I think how long before someone
takes that and shoves it into a vein? Oh,

2102
01:59:41,281 --> 01:59:43,170
totally. Them. One year. You will,

2103
01:59:43,171 --> 01:59:47,070
the spoken reef will be obsolete one year.

2104
01:59:47,400 --> 01:59:48,790
Would you be

2105
01:59:51,020 --> 01:59:53,380
smoking reefer smoking?

2106
01:59:53,500 --> 01:59:58,500
It's like 2012 Joey Refa will be obsolete
between these things because this is

2107
01:59:59,911 --> 02:00:02,700
the first one that's prediction.
This is the fucking first one.

2108
02:00:02,940 --> 02:00:06,210
The next one's going to be. Right. Okay.

2109
02:00:06,211 --> 02:00:09,600
The next one's going to be in your
fucking iPad. You know what I'm saying?

2110
02:00:09,690 --> 02:00:12,980
You just have to look through general,
but we just have to assume it. Gentleman,

2111
02:00:14,090 --> 02:00:17,910
if they're extracting
fucking weed juice from weed,

2112
02:00:17,940 --> 02:00:21,720
how long was it going to beat? So some
motherfucker opens up a store and says,

2113
02:00:21,721 --> 02:00:22,201
Joe Rogan,

2114
02:00:22,201 --> 02:00:25,280
I'm going to put the shit you drink in
the morning or the blue mix and I don't

2115
02:00:25,290 --> 02:00:27,810
take, we'd use with that,
which is all natural.

2116
02:00:27,810 --> 02:00:31,380
They're going to find out that we juice
mixed with the shook up without you the

2117
02:00:31,381 --> 02:00:35,820
shit where you drink in the morning, the
shot, it's going to be like that. Well,

2118
02:00:35,821 --> 02:00:39,270
you know that they say that when
you juice weed or when you eat it,

2119
02:00:39,620 --> 02:00:43,290
you eat it like raw. It doesn't get you
high, but it's really good for your body.

2120
02:00:43,400 --> 02:00:47,340
Yes, super. Really super helped
start getting ready in a year.

2121
02:00:47,341 --> 02:00:50,550
This is going to be obsolete.
She asks people still in to smoke pot,

2122
02:00:50,910 --> 02:00:53,660
but you're not going to have to,
you can just go to meet Joey.

2123
02:00:53,661 --> 02:00:55,670
Did you bring the dripper?
It's going to be like a dean.

2124
02:00:56,180 --> 02:00:58,170
It's going to be an advisor team
thing and you could control it.

2125
02:00:58,380 --> 02:00:59,550
Look what's going on with soda.

2126
02:00:59,551 --> 02:01:03,450
Now you can make [inaudible] at
home that's just gone. This shit.

2127
02:01:03,650 --> 02:01:08,510
Yeah, very good. You know like
when you go to a grocery store

2128
02:01:08,540 --> 02:01:11,990
store and it has like the off brand that's
like 89 cents and it tastes like coke

2129
02:01:11,991 --> 02:01:15,350
but like flat or, or are just
not as good. That's what it is.

2130
02:01:15,351 --> 02:01:16,280
And it makes no sense.

2131
02:01:16,281 --> 02:01:20,450
Like his Po is soda and Popcorn really
that expensive where we have to make it

2132
02:01:20,451 --> 02:01:21,050
at home.

2133
02:01:21,050 --> 02:01:24,860
I think the idea is you're supposed to
be conserving somehow because you know

2134
02:01:24,861 --> 02:01:28,770
you're recycling it using your own
glasses and it tastes like shit though.

2135
02:01:29,060 --> 02:01:29,530
What's the,

2136
02:01:29,530 --> 02:01:32,840
what's the other thing they have the
thing that you put in club soda or water?

2137
02:01:33,320 --> 02:01:34,180
Uh,

2138
02:01:35,770 --> 02:01:37,390
I don't know.
You remember you come buy it.

2139
02:01:37,391 --> 02:01:41,860
It's like why them was something
you put your bottle. Yeah. Yeah,

2140
02:01:42,380 --> 02:01:45,710
at the gyms. Now anybody, I tell you
what I know about you motherfuckers.

2141
02:01:45,711 --> 02:01:48,570
Joe Rogan, I know you remember this.
Remember when we were kids, how south.

2142
02:01:48,571 --> 02:01:53,570
So he used to come if it came like
this sounds like a tank where you were

2143
02:01:53,571 --> 02:01:55,750
professional, alcoholic, that's
what you had at your house.

2144
02:01:55,770 --> 02:02:00,310
Remember New York Seltzer whenever
it happened to that. Ah, yeah.

2145
02:02:00,350 --> 02:02:03,890
Yes and no, but it's got to
be at like Jewish Delis only.
Like they don't have it,

2146
02:02:03,891 --> 02:02:06,500
but a lot of, but it's so weird.
I remember when I was a kid,

2147
02:02:06,501 --> 02:02:11,000
I go to [inaudible] house and we get
great koolaid and put self surrender from

2148
02:02:11,001 --> 02:02:14,030
that gun. It was the best thing
I ever tasted in my fucking life.

2149
02:02:14,380 --> 02:02:17,150
Do you play with bubbles in that
motherfucker? Tremendous. What's up?

2150
02:02:17,210 --> 02:02:21,110
You guys know that this is one of the,
one of the craziest fucking stories ever.

2151
02:02:21,130 --> 02:02:23,540
I think we've talked about this
on the podcast. I'm not sure.

2152
02:02:23,810 --> 02:02:28,460
But that the cocaine, you know cocaine
used to be in Coca Cola. Yeah. Yeah.

2153
02:02:28,570 --> 02:02:31,400
And but the people in New Jersey take
it out now. Yeah, we talked about,

2154
02:02:31,430 --> 02:02:34,840
did we talk about it on the show?
Yeah. That's how nice he is at that.

2155
02:02:34,850 --> 02:02:39,410
There's like billions of dollars in
cocaine being made by a company that its

2156
02:02:39,411 --> 02:02:41,600
tracks it from the the leaves.

2157
02:02:41,601 --> 02:02:46,160
They used to make coca cola or cocaine
or ruts and never, like I said to you,

2158
02:02:46,161 --> 02:02:47,330
it's the whole business.

2159
02:02:47,331 --> 02:02:51,330
Once you tap into the whole thing and
you learn how to control like all right,

2160
02:02:51,510 --> 02:02:54,230
the cartel in the 80s Pablo Escobar,

2161
02:02:54,231 --> 02:02:57,890
all those guys that when
they were processing code,
that's what they were doing.

2162
02:02:58,370 --> 02:02:59,630
They weren't selling it.

2163
02:03:00,140 --> 02:03:04,190
They were getting it and selling a kilo
for 6,000 and what you did with it was

2164
02:03:04,191 --> 02:03:09,110
what? What was your business? Okay.
That was how it started. Then they said,

2165
02:03:09,111 --> 02:03:09,944
wait a second,

2166
02:03:10,250 --> 02:03:14,930
we're going to become partners and get
some of that from New York where we're

2167
02:03:14,931 --> 02:03:17,740
taking it from. So instead of
selling the key for eight from them,

2168
02:03:17,760 --> 02:03:22,490
we're going to get 16 we're going
to get 20% of their profits. Okay.

2169
02:03:22,491 --> 02:03:24,560
Then they said, Ooh,
that's some good money too,

2170
02:03:25,250 --> 02:03:27,320
but they were paying
people to transport it.

2171
02:03:28,660 --> 02:03:32,000
So I would come to Joe Rogan ink and go,
Joe Rogan every week,

2172
02:03:32,200 --> 02:03:36,200
Tuesday you're going to
transport 2000 kilos.

2173
02:03:36,260 --> 02:03:40,790
At 5,000 of Kalo. Okay, that's
it. We're going to do that to you,

2174
02:03:41,210 --> 02:03:43,570
and then they did that.
Then Carlos laid dead,

2175
02:03:43,571 --> 02:03:46,070
got out of prison and went to the
cartel and says, what we're going to do?

2176
02:03:46,370 --> 02:03:49,580
I'll be a new fucking partner.
50% you're going to process it.

2177
02:03:49,910 --> 02:03:52,380
You're going to do this. I'm the one
that's going to take it up to the state,

2178
02:03:52,381 --> 02:03:56,540
sell it, set the pricing, control the
routes. He got the island off the coast,

2179
02:03:56,541 --> 02:04:00,920
whatever, and he got the island there,
so now they, they ran it from a to z.

2180
02:04:01,850 --> 02:04:03,800
You're following me.
They control different a to z.

2181
02:04:03,801 --> 02:04:05,450
They just weren't coke dealers.
No more.

2182
02:04:05,750 --> 02:04:07,670
The same thing's going
to happen with this weed.

2183
02:04:08,120 --> 02:04:11,270
The same thing is happening that
these guys are getting a pound.

2184
02:04:11,300 --> 02:04:12,740
They turn and half of that to Keith.

2185
02:04:13,070 --> 02:04:16,040
They turned the other half into
edible and they, the other half,

2186
02:04:16,041 --> 02:04:18,770
they sell at 20th fucking grant.
There's no loss in wheat.

2187
02:04:19,370 --> 02:04:20,660
When they take the stems off.
Now.

2188
02:04:20,661 --> 02:04:24,240
They'll just throw that into mixing
the edible weed they found floating off

2189
02:04:24,250 --> 02:04:28,550
please. But it's Mexican weed, so he only
cares about that. I didn't hear about it.

2190
02:04:28,560 --> 02:04:30,950
Yeah. Yeah. There's some
kind of like, oh my God,

2191
02:04:31,860 --> 02:04:35,180
2000 times or something like that.
Right.

2192
02:04:35,390 --> 02:04:38,400
Fucking magic dumped from
like a probably I guess

2193
02:04:38,580 --> 02:04:39,413
could be right.

2194
02:04:39,680 --> 02:04:42,040
They might've been running out of
gas. They had to toss it over, but

2195
02:04:43,040 --> 02:04:44,880
what would the best me right here.

2196
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:48,870
Why is it even on the ocean? So
where was it coming from? 180 bails.

2197
02:04:49,200 --> 02:04:53,070
Oh my God.
8,000 pounds of weed.

2198
02:04:53,100 --> 02:04:55,500
Holy fucking shit.

2199
02:04:55,990 --> 02:05:00,360
180 bales of we'd found
floating in the ocean.

2200
02:05:00,570 --> 02:05:04,020
And what do they do about that? Did
they have to burn it now? Can't take it.

2201
02:05:04,021 --> 02:05:08,400
They put it somewhere. Then when they do
a big cookout, well, what's the navy have?

2202
02:05:08,401 --> 02:05:11,370
Medical Marijuana. Why
doesn't the government sell
it? We could use that money.

2203
02:05:11,400 --> 02:05:14,520
Well, first off, they found the bales.
How much water got into those bales?

2204
02:05:15,350 --> 02:05:17,550
Sell it cheap.
Let me tell you something.

2205
02:05:17,600 --> 02:05:21,750
I smoked fucking weed that's been dry
from bells in the early eighties really

2206
02:05:21,960 --> 02:05:25,920
fucking horrible. It tastes like salt
water. Oh really? Fucking horrible.

2207
02:05:26,610 --> 02:05:30,360
Blow the seeds that weeds got season.
We don't want them to do,

2208
02:05:30,361 --> 02:05:32,040
but that we could use that for edibles.

2209
02:05:32,460 --> 02:05:35,040
But the thing with that weed is
they'll take it off. How many bales?

2210
02:05:35,410 --> 02:05:38,610
Hundred and 80 by the time they burn those
bands, that government gets the burn.

2211
02:05:38,611 --> 02:05:43,590
No beat. 92 bells left. Really think I
was fairly well covered. Tell please.

2212
02:05:43,830 --> 02:05:46,020
So what about the,
the salt water and all that shit?

2213
02:05:46,140 --> 02:05:50,820
Some poor soul or fucking some porcelain
like North Dakota where you can't get

2214
02:05:50,821 --> 02:05:54,990
good. Need more fucking brother that likes
to smoke blunts and make videos at his

2215
02:05:54,991 --> 02:05:57,660
house. What's the hardest spot
in the country to get weed?

2216
02:05:58,230 --> 02:05:59,070
Where's the hardest part?

2217
02:06:00,710 --> 02:06:04,470
Front of the Capitol in front of the
camera right in front of the cow might be

2218
02:06:04,471 --> 02:06:07,530
the easiest. I know you ain't gonna
get no weed at the fucking White House.

2219
02:06:07,950 --> 02:06:11,710
I think you'd get weed everywhere. I
think now in this country it's wide open.

2220
02:06:12,060 --> 02:06:15,570
Could you go on the streets like the
old days? I think if you had to yet.

2221
02:06:15,900 --> 02:06:16,441
Hey Dude,

2222
02:06:16,441 --> 02:06:21,441
pull up Penn Jillette's rant on Obama
and we'd Penn Jillette fucking nailed it.

2223
02:06:23,840 --> 02:06:24,480
The,
you know,

2224
02:06:24,480 --> 02:06:27,240
Penn Jillette has a podcast
now on Sundays and uh,

2225
02:06:27,250 --> 02:06:30,780
Adam Carolla's a network and a,
it's called Penn Sunday school.

2226
02:06:30,870 --> 02:06:35,760
And he went on this rant about how
fucked up it is that that marijuana is

2227
02:06:35,761 --> 02:06:37,860
illegal and that people
are in jail for it.

2228
02:06:37,861 --> 02:06:40,960
And one out of six people in jail
are in jail for marijuana. And he,

2229
02:06:40,961 --> 02:06:45,270
he went on his fucking brilliant
rant, man. And it's, it really is.

2230
02:06:45,360 --> 02:06:48,900
It's a shame. Like what, what,
what's going on right now,

2231
02:06:48,930 --> 02:06:52,680
arresting people for marijuana with all
the information we have about how we,

2232
02:06:52,900 --> 02:06:55,680
you know, we know it's not dangerous.
We know the laws are ridiculous.

2233
02:06:55,860 --> 02:06:59,300
It's a real shame when you see
people getting arrested for,

2234
02:06:59,460 --> 02:07:02,320
and he makes this intense point about it.

2235
02:07:03,820 --> 02:07:04,653
Business.

2236
02:07:07,210 --> 02:07:12,210
We know this president has said
his own book dreams from my father,

2237
02:07:12,970 --> 02:07:15,140
1995 before entering politics,

2238
02:07:15,560 --> 02:07:19,910
he admitted that he had used marijuana
and maybe a little blow, maybe,

2239
02:07:20,550 --> 02:07:25,250
maybe a little blow, which
as you know is crazy talk.

2240
02:07:25,640 --> 02:07:29,600
Maybe a little blow is what someone
who uses marijuana every weekend says,

2241
02:07:31,790 --> 02:07:35,620
man, I used cocaine once. It was
crazy, but he used every or two ago.

2242
02:07:35,740 --> 02:07:38,390
Maybe a little blow.
That's true.

2243
02:07:38,530 --> 02:07:42,010
That's such an odd casual way to say,
ah yeah,

2244
02:07:42,030 --> 02:07:46,750
maybe a little now he is not
left us to state's rights.

2245
02:07:46,751 --> 02:07:47,571
As you know,

2246
02:07:47,571 --> 02:07:51,940
a medical marijuana as our good friend
Joe Rogan will point out to you any time

2247
02:07:52,570 --> 02:07:57,570
medical marijuana you can
get in California and the
feds are coming in to try to

2248
02:07:58,271 --> 02:08:00,790
stop this. They're showcasing
piece of states' rights.

2249
02:08:00,791 --> 02:08:05,791
Don't mean Jack Shit to
the Obama administration on
anything except a sub gay

2250
02:08:08,111 --> 02:08:12,340
marriage. What troubles me
about this is, and there's,

2251
02:08:12,610 --> 02:08:15,730
it is not hypocrisy
because as everybody knows,

2252
02:08:15,731 --> 02:08:20,731
hypocrisy doesn't bother me very earthy
and so Obama and yet you feel this is,

2253
02:08:21,620 --> 02:08:26,620
I think it's beyond hypocrisy. I think
it's something to do with class. You know,

2254
02:08:26,621 --> 02:08:30,040
in a lot of people have
accused Obama of class warfare,

2255
02:08:30,041 --> 02:08:31,120
but in the wrong direction.

2256
02:08:31,720 --> 02:08:36,720
I believe this is Obama chortling with
Jimmy Fallon about lower class people.

2257
02:08:38,530 --> 02:08:41,380
Do we believe,
even for a second,

2258
02:08:41,680 --> 02:08:46,680
anybody believe that if Obama had been
busted for marijuana under the laws that

2259
02:08:48,341 --> 02:08:53,341
he condones would his life have been
better if Obama had been caught with the

2260
02:08:54,671 --> 02:08:59,671
marijuana that he says he uses and maybe
a little blow blow cocaine blow felony

2261
02:09:02,771 --> 02:09:07,720
conviction. This casual attitude
towards drugs, a casual attitude door,

2262
02:09:07,721 --> 02:09:11,310
drugs that makes him really cool on the,

2263
02:09:11,311 --> 02:09:15,720
on Jimmy Fallon makes him
the hip president. I'm the
cool president. I'm happy.

2264
02:09:15,730 --> 02:09:20,500
Happiest happened as president. I say
weed, I say blow. It's all a big deal.

2265
02:09:20,501 --> 02:09:23,950
Hahaha.
Huge laugh from the college students.

2266
02:09:24,220 --> 02:09:27,850
And if he had been busted under his laws,

2267
02:09:27,970 --> 02:09:31,390
he would have done hard fucking time.

2268
02:09:31,780 --> 02:09:36,780
And if he had done time in prison time
in federal prison time for his weed and a

2269
02:09:39,101 --> 02:09:39,940
little blow,

2270
02:09:40,030 --> 02:09:45,030
he would not be president of the United
States of America and he would not have

2271
02:09:45,221 --> 02:09:47,350
gone to his fancy ass college.

2272
02:09:47,500 --> 02:09:52,300
He would not have sold books that sold
millions and millions of copies and made

2273
02:09:52,301 --> 02:09:56,170
millions and millions of dollars.
He would not have a beautiful,

2274
02:09:56,200 --> 02:09:59,320
smart wife.
He would not have a great job.

2275
02:09:59,410 --> 02:10:02,110
He would have been in fucking prison.

2276
02:10:02,200 --> 02:10:04,870
And it's not a God damn joke.

2277
02:10:05,200 --> 02:10:09,010
People who smoke marijuana
must be set free.

2278
02:10:09,190 --> 02:10:11,740
It is insane to lock people up.
Now,

2279
02:10:11,741 --> 02:10:15,550
people bust me all the time
for carrying on about how,

2280
02:10:15,551 --> 02:10:18,880
I've never had a sip of alcohol,
never had a puff of marijuana,

2281
02:10:19,030 --> 02:10:23,020
never done any drugs in my life. They say,
why do you always bring that up? Well,

2282
02:10:23,230 --> 02:10:25,570
maybe in this case it's
okay to bring it up. Okay.

2283
02:10:25,810 --> 02:10:28,090
I've never had a puff of marijuana.

2284
02:10:28,300 --> 02:10:33,270
I've never had maybe a little blow.
I've never even had a glass of wine.

2285
02:10:33,500 --> 02:10:34,250
All right?

2286
02:10:34,250 --> 02:10:35,360
None of that shit.

2287
02:10:35,570 --> 02:10:40,570
But the people who do any of this
stuff do not deserve to be in prison.

2288
02:10:42,110 --> 02:10:43,880
Throw some numbers at me. Good. No,

2289
02:10:43,881 --> 02:10:48,810
750,000 people in jail for
a victimless crimes. Uh,

2290
02:10:48,870 --> 02:10:52,670
uh, uh, a great number of which
are marijuana. One in six,

2291
02:10:52,880 --> 02:10:56,450
one in jail are there for about one
in six people. A victimless crime.

2292
02:10:56,480 --> 02:10:59,690
Now when it's ignored,
people in prison,

2293
02:10:59,870 --> 02:11:03,050
one in six people in prison.
What?

2294
02:11:03,051 --> 02:11:07,730
Brilliant rent's six people in prison,
hinge and listening.

2295
02:11:07,740 --> 02:11:09,980
I those love the rent and
if you want to listen to it,

2296
02:11:09,981 --> 02:11:14,450
pendula at Sunday schools is fucking
amazing. I want to meet him so bad.

2297
02:11:14,870 --> 02:11:17,690
We didn't figure this out 10 years
ago, but come on. That's a great,

2298
02:11:17,720 --> 02:11:21,570
that's a great Rancho de wasting my time
with the shift came to the talk to you

2299
02:11:24,060 --> 02:11:28,310
while I'm talking to you right now.
Welcome me about what? It's a business.

2300
02:11:28,311 --> 02:11:29,061
What the fuck do you want?

2301
02:11:29,061 --> 02:11:31,280
Nobody knows prison is a
business and that's what it is.

2302
02:11:31,281 --> 02:11:34,770
It's a fucking business
guides. It's important when
a guy like pendulum, I said,

2303
02:11:34,870 --> 02:11:39,650
boy, guy do for you break the fucking
law. You go to jail, you sell weed.

2304
02:11:39,651 --> 02:11:44,000
I guess the law in 10 bales, you get
caught. You go to jail. I went to jail.

2305
02:11:44,270 --> 02:11:47,330
I'm responsible. I learn how to fucking,
that's it. What are you going to do?

2306
02:11:47,660 --> 02:11:50,570
There's a law. You cannot fucking
do it. You're going to go to jail.

2307
02:11:51,110 --> 02:11:55,100
Jail and prison are a fucking business.
They're a business.

2308
02:11:55,280 --> 02:12:00,020
That's why you get a ticket driving with
the phone. How much they tell you this,

2309
02:12:00,320 --> 02:12:01,640
how much they tell you this,
I don't know.

2310
02:12:01,641 --> 02:12:06,641
$25 until you go down to La County and
it's $225 because you've got to pay the

2311
02:12:07,161 --> 02:12:11,050
court costs. The prison fee,
the judges vacation. It's a,

2312
02:12:11,120 --> 02:12:15,110
it's a fucking business guys. They're
gonna raise the taxes now, uh,

2313
02:12:15,120 --> 02:12:18,830
for fucking parking tickets. It's a
business. What the fuck you want me to do?

2314
02:12:19,070 --> 02:12:20,900
This is the oldest conversation.
The book,

2315
02:12:21,170 --> 02:12:24,170
they should have legalized this
after they shot Kennedy. They didn't.

2316
02:12:24,590 --> 02:12:28,940
We fucking fortunate that we live in
California and we don't have to abide by

2317
02:12:28,941 --> 02:12:31,550
this. When was the last time you would've
stolen? They kicked the door down.

2318
02:12:31,551 --> 02:12:34,220
Joe Rogan. How about you my
friend? So all this shit,

2319
02:12:34,250 --> 02:12:37,550
you guys talked about them kicking the
doors. The feds, I have never seen it.

2320
02:12:37,730 --> 02:12:39,010
I go get weed every day.

2321
02:12:39,170 --> 02:12:42,920
Stop scaring these fucking white kids and
getting them talking. This is nonsense.

2322
02:12:43,190 --> 02:12:47,810
This is nonsense talk and that they should
kinda with Jim when I never drink it.

2323
02:12:47,811 --> 02:12:51,300
So what? So who gives a fuck?
It applies for everything going.

2324
02:12:51,350 --> 02:12:52,640
There's a lot of people who are in jail.

2325
02:12:52,641 --> 02:12:56,180
They get out every day on a DNA
or whatever. You break the law.

2326
02:12:56,181 --> 02:12:59,630
You sell five pounds a week, you
got to go to jail. It's a business.

2327
02:12:59,990 --> 02:13:02,900
You didn't do nothing wrong, but it's
a business. They have guidelines.

2328
02:13:02,901 --> 02:13:05,990
If you get caught with
dirty 28 grams a blow,

2329
02:13:06,290 --> 02:13:08,390
you have to do a certain
amount of fucking time.

2330
02:13:08,600 --> 02:13:11,330
You get caught with a quarter rounds.
So we have to do a certain amount of time.

2331
02:13:11,331 --> 02:13:14,630
You got caught with it. Why are you
crying to me for you got caught with,

2332
02:13:14,631 --> 02:13:17,060
I was a criminal for 30 years. You
ever, somebody gets caught with blow.

2333
02:13:17,350 --> 02:13:21,690
We either blow. No, you follow me. There's
a way to do it and as a way not pile.

2334
02:13:21,730 --> 02:13:21,981
Fuck.

2335
02:13:21,981 --> 02:13:24,680
Are you going to get caught with fucking
weed and not think you're going to go

2336
02:13:24,681 --> 02:13:28,820
to jail if you live in fucking Ohio and
in fucking Kentucky or wherever you're

2337
02:13:28,880 --> 02:13:33,870
gonna go to jail. I kind of see your
point, but I also see his, cause it's a,

2338
02:13:33,871 --> 02:13:36,600
it's an important mind. It's
brilliant though. It's important.

2339
02:13:36,810 --> 02:13:39,950
It's not together with Fallon
and the presence hip or what?

2340
02:13:39,951 --> 02:13:42,470
I don't give a fuck dog. You don't
care. I'm smoking. Look, look.

2341
02:13:43,050 --> 02:13:44,760
This is what I think about
your whole drug thing.

2342
02:13:44,761 --> 02:13:48,360
Looks like the same thing I've rubbed
my balls with for the last 32 years with

2343
02:13:48,361 --> 02:13:50,940
the sativas and the bullshit.
Just get high dog.

2344
02:13:53,790 --> 02:13:57,090
You'd be playing too much drama to the
gift that God gave us. A getting high.

2345
02:13:57,360 --> 02:13:58,980
You got too much drama.
I can't.

2346
02:13:58,981 --> 02:14:01,620
I've got to put a Dang at the
end of the joint to be cool.

2347
02:14:01,670 --> 02:14:06,440
And even while you're smoking electronic
cigarettes, he's fucking electric.

2348
02:14:06,540 --> 02:14:10,040
What? I'm smoking it. Think
about that. I'm smoking. Oh,

2349
02:14:10,200 --> 02:14:13,170
that's all that matters at the end
of the week. That's all that matters.

2350
02:14:13,450 --> 02:14:15,720
Fucking people want to be
intelligent all the time.

2351
02:14:15,740 --> 02:14:19,730
We can't wait to share the stage tonight.
Not fucking stupid rare form.

2352
02:14:22,290 --> 02:14:25,460
And three out of four people in there
for rape and murder. What do you,

2353
02:14:25,461 --> 02:14:28,740
what are you telling me?
Who gives a fuck?

2354
02:14:28,800 --> 02:14:32,100
Who gives a fuck and to show people
that you give a fuck. Who gives a fuck?

2355
02:14:32,101 --> 02:14:33,540
I don't give a fuck.
I don't give a fuck.

2356
02:14:33,541 --> 02:14:35,550
I don't want people locked
up in jail for weed.

2357
02:14:36,090 --> 02:14:38,730
You know what my favorite thing Joe,
they came in here. Jack boot thugs.

2358
02:14:38,750 --> 02:14:43,350
Marilyn fucking high your way for your
little pencil comedian for 20 years.

2359
02:14:43,830 --> 02:14:45,630
I drink from time to time.

2360
02:14:46,020 --> 02:14:49,410
Did ever get behind the car when I'm
drunk and got a Dui. That's a choice.

2361
02:14:49,411 --> 02:14:54,150
You make these all the choices you
make bro. So what are we getting at?

2362
02:14:54,180 --> 02:14:55,020
I know it's illegal.

2363
02:14:55,021 --> 02:14:59,250
I know it should be illegal and I know
that John Lennon is going to make a

2364
02:14:59,270 --> 02:15:04,040
comeback, but for today,
but for today, 2000 tonight,

2365
02:15:04,580 --> 02:15:08,040
but for today, if you get caught
smoking and fucking in New York,

2366
02:15:08,041 --> 02:15:11,610
you're going to jail. I don't care what
you said, bro. I love hearing your talk.

2367
02:15:12,060 --> 02:15:16,740
Fuck, I'm going to put up with this
nonsense pendulum but will give them,

2368
02:15:16,800 --> 02:15:20,430
I was going off yesterday, I was saying
how Joey Diaz will get mad about ketchup

2369
02:15:22,750 --> 02:15:27,530
because there'll be one thing it would
just fucking Heinz Ketchup or ranch. Oh,

2370
02:15:27,540 --> 02:15:31,020
I fucking hate rant. I don't know
how the fuck people delete that shit.

2371
02:15:31,800 --> 02:15:33,270
I don't know how people could eat rat.

2372
02:15:33,300 --> 02:15:35,390
I like when I go to a
place and I say you all,

2373
02:15:35,400 --> 02:15:37,950
you have wings and they
say it comes with ranch.

2374
02:15:37,980 --> 02:15:40,140
I get up and leave even
if I don't get the wings.

2375
02:15:40,500 --> 02:15:42,300
Because if you're going
to serve wings ranch,

2376
02:15:42,330 --> 02:15:46,140
I don't want to do business with you but
I don't want to do business with you.

2377
02:15:46,740 --> 02:15:51,270
I'm very easy. I'm very fucking easy.
So if you fuck up pork fried rice,

2378
02:15:51,271 --> 02:15:54,600
what are we got to talk about? Wings
must be done with blue cheese. Yeah,

2379
02:15:54,630 --> 02:15:57,300
like the wave they invented in Buffalo,
New York and we got to do something.

2380
02:15:58,080 --> 02:16:00,270
Who would original?
You're going to show up with that rant.

2381
02:16:00,271 --> 02:16:04,340
As small as like somebody
is at [inaudible] ranch is
starting to replace ketchup.

2382
02:16:04,380 --> 02:16:04,950
Yeah,
that's good.

2383
02:16:04,950 --> 02:16:08,280
If you're a fucking hillbilly and you
want to taste the ass in your mouth all

2384
02:16:08,281 --> 02:16:11,170
fucking day.
I hate that fucking rich shit.

2385
02:16:11,580 --> 02:16:15,660
Don't put it close to me and I'll put it
around me and see the blue cheese with

2386
02:16:15,661 --> 02:16:18,690
wings and go fuck your mother. That's
the next year. All right, please

2387
02:16:21,700 --> 02:16:26,460
give me a fucking rat. Would fuck
a wing. I can see blue cheeses. We

2388
02:16:28,380 --> 02:16:30,040
go fuck this shit.

2389
02:16:30,430 --> 02:16:32,470
Fucking gotta gimme branch with my wigs.

2390
02:16:36,750 --> 02:16:41,010
That's how you mother
fuckers. I'm stoked. Fucking

2391
02:16:43,500 --> 02:16:44,333
cheeses.
Wigs.

2392
02:16:45,160 --> 02:16:49,100
Fuck your mother fucking Shit.

2393
02:16:49,500 --> 02:16:52,810
I lead my people around the a ranch,
like don't order it. I shit around me.

2394
02:16:52,811 --> 02:16:55,420
Do me that favor.
All Right Ladies and gentlemen,

2395

I got to go and um, do a,

2396
02:17:00,010 --> 02:17:03,610
David tells a, uh, Dave's
old porn show today.

2397
02:17:03,611 --> 02:17:07,690
So we've got a show tonight at the
ice house. It's not quite sold out,

2398
02:17:07,691 --> 02:17:11,620
but it's really close. There's only like
two tickets for jade from that week.

2399
02:17:11,880 --> 02:17:16,450
And it was like sweet. 10 left, two
chickens come on. But it's a ice house.

2400
02:17:16,451 --> 02:17:20,200
comedy.com is a website. You can buy
tickets online. It the lineup tonight.

2401
02:17:20,201 --> 02:17:24,670
Spectacular. It is mad flavor.
Aka Joey motherfucking Diaz,

2402
02:17:24,850 --> 02:17:27,760
Brian Bread Band,
Aka Reichle.

2403
02:17:27,761 --> 02:17:30,580
If you're looking to give them something
with a social security number and tat

2404
02:17:31,510 --> 02:17:34,330
Doug Benson is going to
be all up in this bitch,

2405
02:17:34,480 --> 02:17:39,300
Ari Shaffir just texted me and said
he's gonna make it down. Yes, Paula,

2406
02:17:39,510 --> 02:17:41,450
he'll, he'll squeeze in. And Don,

2407
02:17:41,451 --> 02:17:46,451
my rarest coming down this fucking show
is going to be people chain off the

2408
02:17:46,631 --> 02:17:50,140
chain. There's no, there's no, no way
to be too many people. It's perfect.

2409
02:17:50,200 --> 02:17:51,130
It's beautiful.
It's half ready.

2410
02:17:51,580 --> 02:17:56,530
We're going to ride on a pitch right
into the beach. That's done. That's done.

2411
02:17:56,560 --> 02:17:59,020
You shouldn't even invite it. We're going
to have a great fucking show tonight.

2412
02:17:59,050 --> 02:17:59,950
Whoever comes down,

2413
02:17:59,951 --> 02:18:03,730
we're going to have a great child and
we will also be broadcasting a podcast

2414
02:18:03,731 --> 02:18:07,480
simultaneously. We'll start before
the podcast. We say it starts at nine.

2415
02:18:07,481 --> 02:18:12,100
It really doesn't start until like
nine 39 ish in case we get crazy. Uh,

2416
02:18:12,101 --> 02:18:13,440
and if you're bored and you're in front,

2417
02:18:13,450 --> 02:18:16,570
just leave it on and you'll find
out what time it starts. So, um,

2418
02:18:16,600 --> 02:18:20,260
that is called the Ice House chronicles
and you could watch it live on Ustream

2419
02:18:20,261 --> 02:18:23,830
at the same channel, the, uh,
the Joe Rogan channel on Ustream.

2420
02:18:23,950 --> 02:18:25,990
But if you want to download the podcast,

2421
02:18:25,991 --> 02:18:29,710
you have to get it from either
iTunes or death squad. Dot.

2422
02:18:29,711 --> 02:18:31,300
TV and death squad.

2423
02:18:31,301 --> 02:18:35,170
Dot TV is all of Brian's
podcasts that he produces.

2424
02:18:35,230 --> 02:18:40,230
He's got a gang of them online and they're
eventually going to be broken up into

2425
02:18:40,691 --> 02:18:42,480
separate feeds now, right?
Is that how you doing?

2426
02:18:42,600 --> 02:18:47,300
Yeah, some of the main shows
of are already on a separate
feeds on Itunes, but, uh,

2427
02:18:47,830 --> 02:18:50,600
we have, uh, you know, Doug
Benson has been stopping by a lot.

2428
02:18:50,601 --> 02:18:53,840
He's been on the last two
triple x squads and you know,

2429
02:18:53,841 --> 02:18:55,100
we have MF said we had the,

2430
02:18:55,320 --> 02:18:59,590
the vice or the guy that's behind
call of duty on the last one did.

2431
02:18:59,650 --> 02:19:01,060
We should be all on,
on

2432
02:19:01,060 --> 02:19:02,260
death squad network.

2433
02:19:02,261 --> 02:19:05,950
We should all figure out a way to get
ourselves all together on a website or

2434
02:19:05,951 --> 02:19:09,370
something. Let's do something where we're
all in this thing. You know what I mean?

2435
02:19:09,400 --> 02:19:12,230
I mean, we love for three years. We have
to figure how to do this. I know we,

2436
02:19:12,290 --> 02:19:16,090
we really all should be together. We'll
do, we'll, we'll figure out how to,

2437
02:19:16,150 --> 02:19:18,970
how to organize it just
to, just to, you know,

2438
02:19:18,971 --> 02:19:22,250
like we need at least have
a page on our website.

2439
02:19:22,251 --> 02:19:27,010
Like these are all the people that we
associate with these squad honorary death

2440
02:19:27,020 --> 02:19:28,040
squad.
You know,

2441
02:19:28,040 --> 02:19:32,330
we have like official death squad,
honorary desk squad, closest associates.

2442
02:19:32,450 --> 02:19:37,430
Familiars right. We have to two, we label
these things. Well, I'm trying to do that.

2443
02:19:37,700 --> 02:19:41,180
That's why right now I'm going to, I'm
going to make like a link page thing on,

2444
02:19:41,240 --> 02:19:43,700
you know, like what you were talking about
with the grading and stuff like that.

You got standing those idle or shows?

You're walking on stage right now
and they're going fucking bananas.

2467
02:21:24,120 --> 02:21:25,360
He tried to calm him down

2468
02:21:27,450 --> 02:21:32,240
and that's me going, wow, that's fucking

This mother fucker wants him for
New Year's woods out December 12.

We'll be ready for the Martians.

02:21:49,620 --> 02:21:52,800
We're gonna make our own
tax deductible religion go.

2476
02:21:52,880 --> 02:21:56,820
I've got to put the documentary out of it
sounded like hotcakes if you donate it,

2477
02:21:56,821 --> 02:21:59,580
if you bought it, I give my heart
to you. Thank you very much.

2478
02:21:59,610 --> 02:22:03,270
How did they find any of your stuff?
This was on pay, the documentary,

2479
02:22:03,271 --> 02:22:06,240
but we'll put it on iTunes next week.
So once it's highlight tunes,

2480
02:22:06,241 --> 02:22:10,890
I blow it up on Twitter and Facebook is,
you're a CD still number one on nine 11,

2481
02:22:10,891 --> 02:22:13,830
it went down.
They went down that day.

2482
02:22:13,831 --> 02:22:18,360
Went down from one to like 92 went
not like Brendan Schaub and Brazil.

2483
02:22:18,390 --> 02:22:21,150
You follow me down on and
what is it called again?

2484
02:22:21,180 --> 02:22:23,730
It's either you or the motherfucking
priests, but you know what?

2485
02:22:23,790 --> 02:22:26,910
I'm not a fucking priests. Just are
the priest, right? You want to find it?

2486
02:22:27,720 --> 02:22:30,360
I'm sorry, a priest. You're
going to bring it back up, Julie.

2487
02:22:30,361 --> 02:22:33,050
We're going to bring it back up to
that document going much as it is.

2488
02:22:33,620 --> 02:22:36,560

it's five bucks payloads.

2489
02:22:36,630 --> 02:22:37,920
I appreciate everything you guys.

2490
02:22:37,930 --> 02:22:41,980
Where I got my boss from was the
documentary and that's on payload payload,

2491
02:22:43,020 --> 02:22:47,160
p a y l o a d z.com.

2492
02:22:47,670 --> 02:22:50,820

At least you get the Heli Shit
I'm talking about. I love you Jo.

2495
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:02,800
I love the red band. You know what man?
I lost the link I was talking about.

2496
02:23:02,801 --> 02:23:05,850
That's mine. I went away. I
didn't go on there for so long.

2497
02:23:05,851 --> 02:23:08,610
It just told me they threw me out
of the fucking thing. You know,

2498
02:23:09,180 --> 02:23:10,790
we would be back tonight,

2499
02:23:10,800 --> 02:23:14,910
back tonight for the icehouse
chronicles and tomorrow with a wild man,

2500
02:23:14,911 --> 02:23:19,590
Bert Kreischer. Oh Shit. Oh Shit. Oh
Shit. We love you. We love you guys.

2501
02:23:19,591 --> 02:23:20,424
Thank you.

2502
02:23:26,300 --> 02:23:27,133
Okay.

2503
02:23:31,710 --> 02:23:36,710
Is it okay? I forgot to
thank our sponsors. Ladies
and gentlemen. First of all,

2504
02:23:36,711 --> 02:23:38,360
I'd like to thank unsolicited sponsors.

2505
02:23:38,390 --> 02:23:41,870
Defense soap is a soap company
in that I use for grappling.

2506
02:23:42,560 --> 02:23:46,160
It's Kinda like tea tree oil and all these
like probiotics and it keeps you from

2507
02:23:46,161 --> 02:23:49,570
getting like mad herpes and nasty shit.
Like that's the thing that happens.

2508
02:23:49,590 --> 02:23:51,170
You get scratched up when you do Jujitsu.

2509
02:23:51,171 --> 02:23:54,080
You can get like ringworm and
people don't know about that stuff.

2510
02:23:54,081 --> 02:23:56,540
You can even get staph infection
and people get really sick from it.

2511
02:23:56,810 --> 02:24:01,070
It's very dangerous. And the way to
keep your skin healthy is two fold. One,

2512
02:24:01,071 --> 02:24:04,370
probiotics take acidophilus,
very important, um,

2513
02:24:04,520 --> 02:24:08,610
Kombucha teas and other good probiotic.
But anything probiotic, that's,

2514
02:24:08,611 --> 02:24:09,860
that's like very important.

2515
02:24:09,861 --> 02:24:12,770
But acid office has a really strong
one that keeps ringworm dead.

2516
02:24:13,040 --> 02:24:17,930
And then to use natural soap that doesn't
fuck with the natural ph balance of

2517
02:24:17,931 --> 02:24:20,420
your skin.
You don't want to use antibacterial scope.

2518
02:24:20,600 --> 02:24:23,810
So because that stuff actually
kills the good bacteria as well.

2519
02:24:24,050 --> 02:24:24,950
Then what defense?

2520
02:24:24,951 --> 02:24:27,950
So business has like tea tree oil in
it and all sorts of different like

2521
02:24:27,951 --> 02:24:28,730
eucalyptus,

2522
02:24:28,730 --> 02:24:32,420
all sorts of different night natural oils
that are good for keeping the healthy

2523
02:24:32,421 --> 02:24:35,930
flora of your skin safe,
uh, from nasty cooties.

2524
02:24:36,900 --> 02:24:39,110
So That's defense soap.com
that's unsolicited.

2525
02:24:39,111 --> 02:24:43,250
That shit's for free and see two oh
coconut water and other unsolicited one

2526
02:24:43,300 --> 02:24:45,470
cause the shit.
Those guys are the shit.

2527
02:24:45,500 --> 02:24:48,470
And I have to c two O for as Gatorade.

2528
02:24:48,471 --> 02:24:50,710
I used to be a big
Gatorade guy that you know,

2529
02:24:50,740 --> 02:24:54,050
like after a night of drinking or just
whenever when I'm dehydrated and Joey

2530
02:24:54,051 --> 02:24:58,490
