00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:15,920

00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:20,080
Gotcha.

27
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:20,530
Okay.

28
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:21,011

00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:21,520
Okay.

31
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:21,941

00:00:21,941 --> 00:00:22,360

33
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,193

00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:26,290
Gotcha.

00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:26,530
Okay,

00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:27,100
Burt wins.

41
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,780
So would you like to go first?

42
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:29,890
Would you like Tom Igoe first?

43
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:30,850
I'd like to weigh in first.

44
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:31,240
Okay,

45
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,380
I'm so fucking thirsty.

46
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:32,730
Okay,

47
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:37,210
so we're gonna move over to a
Tom's microphone over there.

48
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:39,883
Do you have a wide shot?

49
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,100
Yeah,

50
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,190
we can get the whole room.

51
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,020
We're going to use that camera up there.

52
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,390
So we'll be using that camera up here.

53
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,620
Here we go.

54
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:52,960
Are we doing this one carpet?

55
00:00:52,961 --> 00:00:54,070
Do we want you to take your clothes off?

56
00:00:54,071 --> 00:00:54,551
First of all,

57
00:00:54,551 --> 00:00:55,960
you definitely want to
take your clothes off.

58
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:58,203
Well I know it works.

59
00:00:58,210 --> 00:00:58,781
Hold on like I know,

60
00:00:58,781 --> 00:01:01,450
but let's make sure we know exactly if
it's exactly right cause it may not be

61
00:01:01,451 --> 00:01:02,410
like my scale at home.

62
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:04,960
I'm always around 200 pounds.

63
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:06,863
Two Oh one.

64
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,430
So I'm two oh one with my clothes on
and she was like one night he's got a

65
00:01:11,431 --> 00:01:13,230
rubber suit on the whole deal.

66
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,673
Okay.

67
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:20,520
Okay.

68
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:20,941
So,

69
00:01:20,941 --> 00:01:21,181
uh,

70
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:22,770
for folks that are just listening here,

71
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:28,130
we're in the studio here and Jamie is
setting up the camera for you too so that

72
00:01:30,151 --> 00:01:32,520
it will point directly down at the scale.

73
00:01:32,521 --> 00:01:35,460
Bert is looking considerably slimmer,

74
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:37,680
considerably slimmer.

75
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:41,760
He's got multiple layers on
and now he's down to underwear,

76
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,830
which are probably wet.

77
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,930
He took the first layer of underwear off.

78
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:47,100
Socks,

79
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,470
a drum roll.

80
00:01:49,471 --> 00:01:50,430
Ladies and gentlemen.

81
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,690
BOMP bomp bomp bomp

82
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:57,540
bomp bomp bomp bomp he's drying himself
off like a wrestling tournament.

83
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,431
Jesus Christ.

84
00:01:59,431 --> 00:01:59,611
Okay,

85
00:01:59,611 --> 00:02:00,444
here we go.

86
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,070
Below two 27 everybody,

87
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,023
here we go.

88
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,440
Bert Kreischer called out.

89
00:02:04,441 --> 00:02:05,274
Joe

90
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:10,630
Two 21.

91
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:11,980
Holy Shit.

92
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:13,840
Holy Shit.

93
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:16,781
Oh No.

94
00:02:16,781 --> 00:02:17,470
But it's right.

95
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,760
I checked my own weight.

96
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:19,470
It's right.

97
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,740
This is what I use at home too,

98
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,491
but we can,

99
00:02:21,491 --> 00:02:21,991
we can chat.

100
00:02:21,991 --> 00:02:26,640
It was 220130530 four points.

101
00:02:26,641 --> 00:02:27,000
Yeah,

102
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,590
that's it.

103
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:30,460
That's it to 21 to 21,

104
00:02:30,461 --> 00:02:31,360
ladies and gentlemen.

105
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:32,860
Holy Shit.

106
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,220
I mean,

107
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,680
now my shit.

108
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:35,111
And then Joe,

109
00:02:35,111 --> 00:02:39,190
my prediction was Tommy wasn't going to
take his shirt off her way and he's got

110
00:02:39,191 --> 00:02:40,000
two now.

111
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
That's shirt is precious ounces
to 21 my man went hard book.

112
00:02:45,161 --> 00:02:45,994
Yes,

113
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,240
I have my watch on.

114
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,180
That's probably at least a few ounces.

115
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,200
That's a good watch.

116
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,191
It's a beautiful watch.

117
00:02:54,191 --> 00:02:55,150
But I'm going to make a drink.

118
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:57,161
Oh,

119
00:02:57,161 --> 00:02:58,720
you're going to drink while it's going on.

120
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,920
Oh goodness.

121
00:02:59,921 --> 00:03:00,490
This is,

122
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:01,271
this is chaos.

123
00:03:01,271 --> 00:03:01,780
Here we go.

124
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,910
Tommy looking very slim to,

125
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:04,391
here we go.

126
00:03:04,391 --> 00:03:05,224
Ladies and gentlemen,

127
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,250
show fuck.

128
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,870
Holy Shit.

129
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:20,270
Wow.

130
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:21,260
First of all,

131
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:23,840
congratulations to the both of you.

132
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,890
Fuck that is,

133
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:27,140
that's gigantic.

134
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,070
I'm so thirsty.

135
00:03:28,071 --> 00:03:28,970
It's ridiculous.

136
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,700
We got some coconut water.

137
00:03:31,701 --> 00:03:33,260
If you want to get some
electrolytes in you.

138
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:35,120
Holy Shit.

139
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:35,983
You guys want to coconut water?

140
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:36,200
No,

141
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:36,351
no,

142
00:03:36,351 --> 00:03:37,040
I'm good.

143
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,410
God,

144
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:39,440
you want to go get water
or the calories in this?

145
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:40,040
Uh,

146
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:40,281
no,

147
00:03:40,281 --> 00:03:40,671
not at all.

148
00:03:40,671 --> 00:03:41,510
It's a Stevia.

149
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:44,570
It's called via Zvm Guy Sodium Tommy.

150
00:03:44,571 --> 00:03:45,590
Holy Shit.

151
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,180
Wow.

152
00:03:47,181 --> 00:03:48,410
So those extra pounds,

153
00:03:48,411 --> 00:03:49,220
like whatever,

154
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:49,611
you know,

155
00:03:49,611 --> 00:03:52,220
you didn't drink water
that home made up for it.

156
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,110
God Damn it.

157
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:55,880
We gotta do this all
again tomorrow of weight.

158
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,620
What happens tomorrow?

159
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,520
Let's take tomorrow.

160
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,000
We're,

161
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,950
let's look at question one.

162
00:04:00,951 --> 00:04:01,670
Victory.

163
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:03,320
Well here man.

164
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:03,890
What's it now?

165
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:04,520
What's it now?

166
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:04,731
Okay,

167
00:04:04,731 --> 00:04:04,971
we go,

168
00:04:04,971 --> 00:04:05,870
we got this out of the way.

169
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:10,730
Oh my God.

170
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:11,360
So thirsty.

171
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:11,750
Wow.

172
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,970
So let's just cut the shit and
get right to the way we go.

173
00:04:13,971 --> 00:04:17,300
Right to the fucking way I should weigh
in first cause I have a feeling that,

174
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:17,840
okay,

175
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,673
don't be a pussy.

176
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:19,963
Don't be scared.

177
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:20,871
Okay folks,

178
00:04:20,871 --> 00:04:21,320
Jesus.

179
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,190
Oh by the way,

180
00:04:22,191 --> 00:04:24,470
we did the height tests,

181
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:25,040
uh,

182
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,180
because Ari Shaffir,

183
00:04:26,181 --> 00:04:29,900
who was supposed to pay
if they got a low two 27,

184
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,550
are you supposed to pay for their trip?

185
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:36,880
The loser has to shave their beard and
the loser has to pay for the winners trip

186
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:39,110
of their choice IX.

187
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,420
Unless they can get down to two 27.

188
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:44,810
And which Arusha fear agreed
that he was going to pay.

189
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:49,160
But now our is bogging and he's
saying that they have to be,

190
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:49,530
uh,

191
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:49,791
their,

192
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:54,410
their height has to be measured because
the body mass index would indicate that

193
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:56,630
they have to be a certain
height or they're obese.

194
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,463
It was really weird.

195
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,010
So we,

196
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:59,030
we tested the heights.

197
00:04:59,060 --> 00:04:59,840
Okay.

198
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,673
Um,

199
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:01,160
uh,

200
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:05,870
Tom is just under six feet tall and for
all you assholes at Sam five foot two,

201
00:05:05,871 --> 00:05:06,920
we tested me too.

202
00:05:06,921 --> 00:05:07,730
I'm five,

203
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,020
eight and up cunt hair.

204
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,333
Um,

205
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,620
and Burt is taller than Tom,

206
00:05:12,621 --> 00:05:13,191
so birds.

207
00:05:13,191 --> 00:05:13,880
Good.

208
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,290
You're about six one.

209
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:18,440
So the body mass index.

210
00:05:18,441 --> 00:05:20,140
I think you dropped dude.

211
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:20,900
You look good.

212
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:21,400
Get on here.

213
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:21,880
Get on here.

214
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,660
You might have it.

215
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:22,911
All right.

216
00:05:22,911 --> 00:05:25,340
So Burt was at two 21 yesterday.

217
00:05:25,341 --> 00:05:27,230
You look significantly thinner today.

218
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,210
I feel her hurting.

219
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:28,670
Okay.

220
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:28,981
He's hurt.

221
00:05:28,981 --> 00:05:29,601
And let's see,

222
00:05:29,601 --> 00:05:30,650
he's getting on the scale.

223
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:38,930
Two 24 to 20 for Burke for one pound,

224
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,040
one pound less.

225
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:41,390
One fucking pound.

226
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:43,190
I think Tommy's got it here.

227
00:05:43,191 --> 00:05:43,941
Let's see here.

228
00:05:43,941 --> 00:05:44,450
Fuck.

229
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:45,283
Say Goodbye.

230
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:48,220
Say Goodbye to Hollywood.

231
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:49,510
I'm on me.

232
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,380
He's going to Paris for a soccer game.

233
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,710
Please have gained weight.

234
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:55,730
Okay,

235
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,050
you fucking do.

236
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:01,760
Tom Gets it running away.

237
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:02,750
Ladies and gentlemen,

238
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:06,920
we have a winner in the
Hashtag who is fat contest.

239
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:12,190
The winner is Thompson girl
down to 216 fucking pounds.

240
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,680
Outrageous,

241
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,800
outrageous coconut waters.

242
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:21,740
C Two oh coconut waters must be consumed
now get those electrolytes in your

243
00:06:21,741 --> 00:06:22,574
system,

244
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,593
boys.

245
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:24,643
Well done.

246
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,401
Well done.

247
00:06:25,401 --> 00:06:26,390
Amazing effort.

248
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,340
It's not easy to lose weight.

249
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:31,040
It's really not easy to lose
it the way you guys did it.

250
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:31,970
Two days in a row,

251
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,440
man.

252
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,273
Crazy shit.

253
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:35,450
That was the that yet.

254
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:37,030
Today was the hardest
workout I've ever had.

255
00:06:37,031 --> 00:06:39,730
It ran eight miles last one fucking palm.

256
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:40,770
That's crazy.

257
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,050
I think my body was like in shock.

258
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:43,920
That's what happens.

259
00:06:43,921 --> 00:06:45,060
That's what happens to fighters.

260
00:06:45,061 --> 00:06:45,191
It,

261
00:06:45,191 --> 00:06:46,200
it shuts down.

262
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,213
So have a seat.

263
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,690
Guys pulled it off.

264
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:51,900
I've been thinking about that.

265
00:06:51,901 --> 00:06:54,090
Drink this entire fucking day.

266
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,083
Beard,

267
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:57,360
we've got a beard trimmer
over there at charging it up.

268
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,800
I should probably a shave your
beard after you have some pizza.

269
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,680
I mean have a live a little,

270
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,080
I'm going to have a hard time eating
pizza with his fat fucking face.

271
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:09,510
It's not going to look good.

272
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:12,480
Flat white man got so fat.

273
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:13,171
Yeah,

274
00:07:13,171 --> 00:07:14,730
you look pretty fucking skinny today,

275
00:07:14,731 --> 00:07:15,040
man.

276
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,420
You did.

277
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,000
You do look significantly Skinner.

278
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:18,420
You skinny skinnier today.

279
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:19,410
I don't know man.

280
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,470
I think you a little distended yesterday
with that pulled pork and your stomach

281
00:07:22,471 --> 00:07:24,850
from the night before or the
night before for the Waynes.

282
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:28,720
Wayne's Collard Greens pulled pork.

283
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:33,791
I won though.

284
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:34,540
Seriously?

285
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,230
What is that long strand DNA?

286
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,150
That Mickey mantle jeans.

287
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,571
I gotta be honest with you.

288
00:07:43,571 --> 00:07:44,081
Derek Jeter,

289
00:07:44,081 --> 00:07:45,640
you showed a little Mickey mail today.

290
00:07:45,641 --> 00:07:47,350
How did you get down to two 16?

291
00:07:47,351 --> 00:07:48,250
What did you do different?

292
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:48,601
Do you want to,

293
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:49,434
it's so funny.

294
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,083
Three,

295
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,520
he said something in passing
and that's what I did.

296
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:55,220
What?

297
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,500
But I just didn't acknowledge it.

298
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:57,491
He goes,

299
00:07:57,491 --> 00:07:57,850
uh,

300
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:59,980
she go to Burke Williams and
just sweat it out in the spa.

301
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,510
That's what I've been doing for two days.

302
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:04,361
I just can't eat today.

303
00:08:04,361 --> 00:08:07,480
I just come out of fluids today and then
fucking go to Berkeley and sweated out.

304
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:08,351
How you feeling,

305
00:08:08,351 --> 00:08:08,650
Bro?

306
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:09,250
I feel like a chain.

307
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,510
I want to give a shout out to
God how to him and nothing's,

308
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:12,760
none of this is possible.

309
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:13,893
And then,

310
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:15,163
uh,

311
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:16,413
Jake Smith.

312
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:17,170
Thank you Jake.

313
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,003
Who's Jake?

314
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,830
He's a fighter who gave
me all this insight on,

315
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,070
ah,

316
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:22,351
oh,

317
00:08:22,351 --> 00:08:22,561
cool.

318
00:08:22,561 --> 00:08:23,394
Jake's,

319
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,033
go fuck yourself.

320
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:29,760
Shout out to it's anybody.

321
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:30,751
Oh my God.

322
00:08:30,751 --> 00:08:31,584
Can you do this?

323
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:37,620
[inaudible].
