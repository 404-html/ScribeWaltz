1
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:05,550
I think we sold so many
flashlights that does.

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,300
It was impossible for them to sell more
because everyone who listens to the show

3
00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:13,410
is a pervert. No way they'd tap
the market. So what? I mean,

4
00:00:13,411 --> 00:00:15,810
you can only advertise with
someone for so long. I mean,

5
00:00:15,811 --> 00:00:18,720
everybody listens to this show has
heard about the fleshlight by now.

6
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,600
It makes sense that they wouldn't be a
spot or the relationship. Yeah, yeah,

7
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:27,420
yeah, yeah. Well, it's not that they
backed out. It says we ended it.

8
00:00:27,421 --> 00:00:31,280
We did it for a long time. So
this is totally amicable. Cool.

9
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:35,130
They're very nice guy. Coca Cola is,
but you keep advertising, Jack. I don't,

10
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:39,150
I don't. Not at run in any companies, man.
I don't give a fuck. I tweet them still.

11
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:42,580
I still talk to them. They're great
guys. Good video that they just posted.

12
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,390
That's crazy.

13
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:47,400
I just couldn't keep up with the
first product ever where they stopped

14
00:00:47,401 --> 00:00:50,670
advertising because that people,
they couldn't keep up with the demand.

15
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,220
That's true. I'm just joking around about
that. I mean, it makes sense. The only,

16
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,870
the only product ever is a fake vagina.
That's the only one that they'd have to,

17
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:04,320
they'd run out of materials.
I don't understand what you're saying.

18
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:08,770
That skin is rare. You know
how they make that skin? Yeah.

19
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:13,410
It's actually a food based, um, uh,
product. I'm chewing on one right now.

20
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:17,040
It's like,
it's not really like a plastic,

21
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:20,190
it's almost like you could almost
like digest it with your body.

22
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,210
It's really weird. You got to check
out the, they just posted a video.

23
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,870
Just go, what the fuck that I walked
in? What did we walk it? Let's not,

24
00:01:27,871 --> 00:01:29,250
this isn't even a real sponsor.

25
00:01:29,251 --> 00:01:33,300
We're actually sponsored by on at.com
makers of a Alpha brain, shroom tech,

26
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,890
shroom tech, sports room, tech immune.
And uh, also we recently got hacked,

27
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,790
ladies and gentlemen, we
got hacked. They got in,

28
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:46,020
got ahold of some encrypted data and um,
that you could, it's all explained it.

29
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,280
ana.com forward slash breach.
Uh, and because of that,

30
00:01:50,281 --> 00:01:55,281
they're offering an 18% discount off of
everything for the next couple of days.

31
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,070
So you just use the code name,
got your back. People are, uh,

32
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,000
very bummed out over there that
someone hacked into the system.

33
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:07,320
But that's just the way it goes,
man. If you're, if you're online,

34
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:11,220
someone can get you those little script
kitties, those bad motherfuckers.

35
00:02:11,221 --> 00:02:13,260
Apparently it wasn't
the best setup at on it.

36
00:02:13,261 --> 00:02:16,200
They've radically improved it because
of that and they feel terrible about it.

37
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,810
She said they just didn't know.
It's a fairly new company,

38
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,940
but I've been hacked three times.
Just a gas station this year and you know,

39
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,210
I mean I've had to change my,

40
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:28,020
all my shit gas stations all the time.

41
00:02:28,021 --> 00:02:32,280
Something happens when you run your
card through that thing and they can,

42
00:02:32,281 --> 00:02:35,080
they need to stick. Yeah.
When you slide it through the,

43
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,890
and when you run your card through and
then you put in your, your zip code,

44
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:42,450
apparently some of them are rigged and
some of them just copy your information

45
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:46,080
like, and then they have to figure
out which gas station it was,

46
00:02:46,081 --> 00:02:48,330
where were you when it happened,
which machine did you use?

47
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,200
And then they find out and go in the
machine and find out who rigged it so they

48
00:02:52,201 --> 00:02:54,900
can be Rick. Bye. Yeah, it could be that.

49
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:57,990
It could be a third party
that transmits that data.

50
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:01,210
It's really pretty sophisticated.
It's, it's really nuts really.

51
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:04,810
But there's a lot of money in organized
crime and stealing credit cards is a big

52
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:08,020
part of it. And so it's just fucking
super common. If you're online,

53
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:09,610
people are going to go after you.

54
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:14,140
That's that discount also works
on kettle bells and battle ropes.

55
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,200
So all shit to become manly.
Go get some. All right.

56
00:03:17,201 --> 00:03:21,770
And thanks to Alienware MMA for hooking
us up with some dope laptops and go

57
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:25,540
death squad.tv and pick yourself up some,
some cat shirts.

58
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,660
So that's the kind of shirts that I like.

59
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,700
Are you going to keep selling
the first one? Uh, no,

60
00:03:30,701 --> 00:03:35,701
but I do have like a box of the old ones
leftover that I may eventually put on

61
00:03:35,741 --> 00:03:39,070
sale. There's only like it like a
hundred of them lot. The old one's dope.

62
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:42,070
I like the new one.
The old one.

63
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:45,160
I would love it if you had that for
sale as well cause I just think it's the

64
00:03:45,161 --> 00:03:49,860
shit that, that cat though was awesome.
That cat is the future. Alright,

65
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:54,040
you dirty pitches. Kat Von d
is here. Buckled the fuck up.

66
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:57,460
The real cat play the music Brian.
So it can be official

67
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:04,280
experience.
Joe Rogan podcast.

68
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,850
There's a lot of shit over it on and talk,
comment he about,

69
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:13,840
I don't have to talk about all the
products. Get it. Sometimes it just,

70
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,840
I just half for a while there dude.

71
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:20,890
I was very impressed with your
enthusiasm and your passion during those

72
00:04:20,891 --> 00:04:23,710
commercials when the
passion is still every time.

73
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,730
Well it's just based on reality.
It's based on the last me all the time.

74
00:04:27,731 --> 00:04:31,390
Dude is that shit for real people to
ask me that all the time. I'm like dude,

75
00:04:31,391 --> 00:04:34,990
Joe would not be involved in
some shit that didn't work.

76
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,660
He's only involved in shit that works.
Trust me,

77
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:42,130
you don't take it every day at mine. If
you, if you're interested in nootropics,

78
00:04:42,131 --> 00:04:45,610
there's a lot of stuff that you can get
on your own and just buy it in bulk and

79
00:04:45,611 --> 00:04:49,870
it's way cheaper than doing this like
what we've done. But just go Google it.

80
00:04:49,871 --> 00:04:52,750
It's, it's fascinating shit. It's
vitamins for your brain. It works.

81
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,160
You don't need that. You clever woman.
No, you're on top of shit already.

82
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:00,610
Imagine the tattoos on shroom tech.

83
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:05,440
My friend Eddie Bravo is here with Kat
von d because Kat von d actually wrote on

84
00:05:05,441 --> 00:05:06,580
Eddie browse chest,

85
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,700
pull it up.
I haven't shaved my chest in a long time,

86
00:05:12,701 --> 00:05:16,090
so it's kind of a Paul
Stanley false tail leash.

87
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,750
That's my grandmother.
Wow. I love that Tattoo.

88
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:25,360
That was three years ago,
something like that.

89
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:30,250
That is uh, my, what I think is the
most impressive style of artwork.

90
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,560
That reproduction of portraits.

91
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,170
Yeah.
I saw this,

92
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:39,880
I saw this girl last night that had her
father on her arm as a child though.

93
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,400
And instead just as this little
child on her arm, and I'm like,

94
00:05:42,401 --> 00:05:45,670
has anyone ever tried to like
it? Does it, is it messy?

95
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,910
Is it weird when people are like, you
know, like I tried to make him blink,

96
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:51,850
you know, like as a baby and like
fucker whipped the face and it's like,

97
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,320
is that weird to you? She goes, no,

98
00:05:53,321 --> 00:05:56,500
this guy's cummed on it before and I
made him lick it off and I'm like, what?

99
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:00,020
Like that's just crazy.
Like there's realistic tattoos.

100
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,050
I don't know what the hell he just said.

101
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,950
I think Brian like you need to go take
some medicine for a second. Then I'm like,

102
00:06:09,951 --> 00:06:12,920
damn, I smoke too much with too
much. We get no, I think Brian did.

103
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:18,480
You just went too deep. Right? You just
got ran up a ramp covered in Vaseline.

104
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:20,730
Definitely too much weight on my house.

105
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:26,110
I have to deal with him
by myself sometimes. I was
trying to remember this crazy.

106
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,040
I was trying to remember the
story that happened last night,

107
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:29,270
but then I was too stoned to remember it.

108
00:06:29,271 --> 00:06:32,300
So then I was like trying to stumble
what telling his daughter just got a slow

109
00:06:32,301 --> 00:06:34,220
down side and the crazy
it's going to be okay.

110
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:39,390
The crazy thing about how this tattoo
came about was her shop is one was one

111
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:43,130
block away from old legends.
Remember that? Yeah. I pass by

112
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:47,360
legends is a, an MMA gym that
I was in Hollywood. Yeah. Yeah.

113
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:51,690
It was a kickbox. I'm just right
down the street from your shop.

114
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:54,690
So I would pass by to go home.
I lived in north Hollywood.

115
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,160
I would pass by to and from work
all the time. It always your tech.

116
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:00,720
I never saw your show,

117
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:03,570
but I knew who you were from the
billboards around Hollywood and shit.

118
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:08,070
But I never, ever, not once thought
about ever getting a tattoo for me.

119
00:07:08,071 --> 00:07:11,490
I just didn't think about it. I haven't,
I know what happened. My Guy, Carson Hill,

120
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,680
you know, I just, I have this
tattoo artist who's awesome name,

121
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:17,460
name is Carson Hill is an La fucking
amazing, but I was, I'm cool with them.

122
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,400
I'm only going to let him fuck with my
shit now. That's what I was thinking.

123
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:25,050
But then after like a year
of just passing by your shop,

124
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,590
I ended up in the u at the UFC in Dallas.

125
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:30,420
We were in Dallas and
there wasn't shit to do.

126
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,870
And I used to work for the UFC and I'm
sitting here in my hotel room and to all

127
00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:38,400
my show comes up at Alma
awards. It's like, oh, I was
there. My mom, it's like one.

128
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:40,050
Yeah. So I'm watching
this, the Alma awards,

129
00:07:40,051 --> 00:07:44,700
is that the Latino celebrity awards or
whatever, and I'm watching that, you know,

130
00:07:44,701 --> 00:07:46,710
meet, be being Latin, you
know, I'm like, Oh shit,

131
00:07:46,711 --> 00:07:48,990
I didn't know that white dude
was fucking half Mexican,

132
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,060
like actors are coming up and rock stars.
You're talking about me. I'm like, oh no,

133
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,250
no, no. And then, and then, and then
Kat von d comes up and I'm like,

134
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,180
Oh shit, she's Mexican. Holy Shit.
I didn't know I was born in Mexico,

135
00:08:00,181 --> 00:08:03,410
but my family's from Argentina. So
I am Latino, but I'm on mic. Yeah.

136
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:07,510
So at that point, your family's from
Argentina. Yeah. Wow. That's cool. Yeah.

137
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:12,030
So at that point, let me, let me finish
this real quick. So at that point,

138
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:14,160
now she's in my head, I might
think, oh, she's Mexican.

139
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:17,730
So that was Friday afternoon,
Monday,

140
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:21,480
first class after class.
It's 11 o'clock at night.

141
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:26,430
I'm driving pastor shop. It's closed
up and I'm thinking, oh, wild hair.

142
00:08:26,431 --> 00:08:29,310
Just delusional thought.
Hey,

143
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:33,900
maybe I could get her to do a tattoo on
me and film it and put it on my show.

144
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:38,640
They can like, like she would actually
do it. I'm thinking for 10 seconds.

145
00:08:38,641 --> 00:08:40,050
I'm thinking that's a good idea.

146
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:44,290
But then as I made a right on Santa Monica
Boulevard, I'm like, she's so famous.

147
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:48,300
She would never do that. I'm like,
what a crazy dumb thought. I go home,

148
00:08:48,301 --> 00:08:53,301
take a shower to get a late night
bite to eat at kitchen 24 by myself.

149
00:08:53,311 --> 00:08:55,920
I just walked in. I'm
quite good. Yeah. Sat there

150
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,160
and this girl comes up to me that I
knew from a long time with Jason's

151
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:02,460
ex-girlfriend, Jason Chambers. Ex
girlfriend comes up to us, Eddie,

152
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,060
what's up and she gives me hugs. Oh
Shit. And she looks at me and goes,

153
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:11,730
you should let Kat von d tattoo
you. I'm like, that is crazy.

154
00:09:11,731 --> 00:09:14,250
Because I was just thinking
that an hour and a half ago.

155
00:09:14,251 --> 00:09:17,030
That's insane or whatever. I'm like,
that's a pretty crazy. You're like,

156
00:09:17,031 --> 00:09:19,290
tell us what happened. And then
she goes, no, but I'm serious.

157
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,560
I could actually get you on the
show. I'm like, what? He goes,

158
00:09:22,561 --> 00:09:25,320
yeah I work on the show. They
hired me. That shit ain't real.

159
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:32,410
Just interesting that you came in
writing on that vehicle because we wasn't

160
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:32,641
really,

161
00:09:32,641 --> 00:09:36,840
honestly would have probably worked more
against you than for you but somehow

162
00:09:36,841 --> 00:09:37,301
you want eat it.

163
00:09:37,301 --> 00:09:41,220
But she was bros with the casting
director and she goes to casting director

164
00:09:41,221 --> 00:09:44,490
loves USC.
Well she did.

165
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:48,720
She did get me on the shot and for that
I am grateful for you all. Thank you.

166
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:49,870
So she's funny.

167
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:52,980
Winship worksite Wayne when you have some
weird ideas and all that stuff here it

168
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,770
becomes reality.

169
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:57,220
The next morning I meet
the casting director and he
said let's do it cause he's

170
00:09:57,221 --> 00:10:02,221
a big UFC fan and I was just right
there on the show and you know what they

171
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:06,670
originally she got, they go, cat is
very picky on who she does tattoos,

172
00:10:06,671 --> 00:10:09,430
what's true. So she doesn't pick
you. Will you go with the other two?

173
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:13,540
And I said No. You on the fence
at all? Um, well, you know,

174
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:17,050
it's when we would film the show if
there was like a screening process,

175
00:10:17,051 --> 00:10:21,330
so like I would get these lists
of different ideas and peep,

176
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:24,600
peep requests I guess. And so
I would, based on the artwork,

177
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:28,030
I would filter through and do the ones
that I knew that I was capable of or I'd

178
00:10:28,031 --> 00:10:29,560
be excited about.
Um,

179
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:32,830
but they wouldn't really tell me much
about the person come in because they want

180
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:36,730
it to be all natural on camera and stuff.
So I didn't know. I don't, I think a new,

181
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:40,110
very minimal other than your
name. I didn't know. She
didn't know. She just for,

182
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,180
they said no. Very strange.
Yeah. I said I wouldn't do it.

183
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:47,080
I felt that was so crazy that I thought
of it that night and an hour and a half

184
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,500
later, some chick makes it happen. I
thought it was so crazy that I said, no,

185
00:10:50,501 --> 00:10:52,760
I won't do it unless cat does
it. I'm not interested. Yeah.

186
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:53,021
Yeah.

187
00:10:53,021 --> 00:10:56,860
That is really odd when things like that
happen because there's no denying it

188
00:10:56,861 --> 00:10:59,740
that like statistically
put that shit on paper.

189
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:03,920
How crazy the thought you'll store into
your head on paper and then meeting.

190
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:06,700
Well, what are the odds of that?
That's like fucking millions to one.

191
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:11,230
It's almost like they're,
the story of your life is like the DA.

192
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:15,280
The writers are working on it last and
it's just getting shittier and easier for

193
00:11:15,281 --> 00:11:18,100
things to happen.
It's like instead of big,

194
00:11:18,101 --> 00:11:22,570
some complicated fucking Warren peace,
epic have, you know, a complicated,

195
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:24,550
I do 20 personalities.
No,

196
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:26,890
I just think about some shit and
the next day you get a phone call.

197
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:30,370
It's like an hour, hour and a
half late. Imagine if you had,

198
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:34,390
imagine if you had like a bunch of magic
gifts and you did know about them and

199
00:11:34,391 --> 00:11:36,700
you would just use it.
I'm on tattoos and shit.

200
00:11:36,701 --> 00:11:39,700
When you could even maybe fly or
breathe under water or something,

201
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:45,160
you know, like you might've had a
magic gift and you, you made it happen.

202
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:48,280
You're like, maybe get a handful
of those in your life. I told him.

203
00:11:48,281 --> 00:11:51,290
And you just decided to do
it on make it happen. Yeah.

204
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,960
It's crazy actually when you think it,
it

205
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,990
would even if you had like a little magic,

206
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:59,830
like the ability to make something happen,
a few gifts like that in your life,

207
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:03,100
you're really not gonna be able to do
anything that's truly supernatural.

208
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,260
I mean it would have
already been done already.

209
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:09,340
So like when you look at someone who's
got like a tattoo is actually one of the

210
00:12:09,341 --> 00:12:11,050
best things you can do.
You know,

211
00:12:11,051 --> 00:12:14,140
get something that's permanent artwork
on s on your skin. That to you,

212
00:12:14,141 --> 00:12:15,700
I know means an incredible amount.

213
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:18,700
And to get it from someone like her
and to get it all in like one bit,

214
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:20,990
that's really is better
than like most magic tricks

215
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:25,200
that you know. Right. It's
fucking incredible. I was
trying to tell the stories,

216
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:25,811
the producers,

217
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:28,450
they didn't want to hear that shit
cause they didn't want to hear that.

218
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,240
One of the chicks that worked on
the show like pulled the string,

219
00:12:31,241 --> 00:12:33,130
they didn't want it to
make that part of the show.

220
00:12:33,131 --> 00:12:37,000
And the second is breaks the halls
of reality. Yeah. They, so they,

221
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:39,760
I was telling that story. I'm like, I
got an incredible story, but they got it.

222
00:12:39,761 --> 00:12:41,680
We don't want hear that story.
Oh, that's a great story.

223
00:12:41,681 --> 00:12:42,700
Why wouldn't they tell that story?

224
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:47,200
Because then it shows that someone
got dragged in and pulled strings.

225
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:50,260
I think it's smarter on
the, I mean, you know, the,

226
00:12:50,261 --> 00:12:54,610
the reliability on that in comparison
to your, your actual story, you know,

227
00:12:54,611 --> 00:12:58,060
like what you do and what it took to
get you there and the meaning behind the

228
00:12:58,061 --> 00:13:00,940
tattoos a lot more, I guess. Um, you know,

229
00:13:00,941 --> 00:13:02,950
it resonates with the viewer
much more than saying, oh,

230
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:07,090
this is a Hollywood moment. I
was at fucking, you know, cafe.

231
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,590
Think of it as a Hollywood moment though.

232
00:13:09,591 --> 00:13:13,470
I think for him it's just a crazy
piece of synchronicities. Yeah.

233
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,120
And I think we ended up actually
talking about that kind of stuff anyway,

234
00:13:16,121 --> 00:13:18,420
like throughout the, yeah, I was,

235
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:21,190
I may have told you that
story before we file for you.

236
00:13:21,191 --> 00:13:25,520
A big fan of synchronicity. Do, do
a experience in your life. Yeah. Oh,

237
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:29,800
I'm a big fan of being the master of
your own reality. I think, you know,

238
00:13:29,801 --> 00:13:32,860
it's not so much about wishing your way
through something or manifesting it,

239
00:13:32,861 --> 00:13:36,400
but you know, I think certain mental
attitudes and mentalities that are,

240
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,190
are more productive than others.

241
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:41,010
Well, we know that certain
attitudes, I mean you,

242
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,890
you've talked about it like
that John Sarno back thing.

243
00:13:43,891 --> 00:13:46,340
Like if you have like some
sort of, uh, like you,

244
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:51,150
you could be upset or angry at things
and have a bad back and think that you're

245
00:13:51,151 --> 00:13:54,840
bad back is actually like an injury.
So it's not even an injury.

246
00:13:54,841 --> 00:13:59,100
It literally is your own brain causing
your body to not up and some sort of a

247
00:13:59,101 --> 00:14:03,810
crazy way that's painted deprives,
I don't know the exact science behind it,

248
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:07,770
but when you have some serious
stress in your life somehow,

249
00:14:07,771 --> 00:14:12,600
this is a theory that I heard. I didn't
make this up. Your body, the pain is real.

250
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:15,330
Your body will suffocate your,

251
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,810
or deprive oxygen to the,

252
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,220
your back muscles and then
they get really sore and tight.

253
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:24,390
That's what happens when you get
nervous or stressful. That's the theory,

254
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:28,740
you know, it Kinda makes sense
because I have, I have, uh,

255
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:31,870
a backstory as well, but I don't want
to get into that. But I believe it,

256
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:37,110
that's a long story. We got to, we're
here to talk about, my thinking was that,

257
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:41,860
you know, you really do change a lot
of shit with your mind. I mean your,

258
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,770
your mind just in the things that
you come up with, like your artwork.

259
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:46,990
Do you mean it doesn't,

260
00:14:46,991 --> 00:14:50,100
it doesn't ever feel like sometimes like
where were the fuck is this coming from?

261
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:53,150
This is almost like,
like it's coming out of nowhere.

262
00:14:53,151 --> 00:14:55,360
It's coming into your creativity,
you know,

263
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,460
it's coming out of this
weird place in your mind.

264
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:59,960
Then all of a sudden it's manifested
itself in this beauty. These,

265
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:01,220
is it ever like freak you out?

266
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:05,320
Um, I don't know if it freaks me out. I
just get excited about things, you know?

267
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:08,530
And I mean, I dunno, I'm in love
with my job. I love, I mean,

268
00:15:08,531 --> 00:15:11,170
I can't even call it my job. That'd
be so weird to say that, you know,

269
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,900
or I guess I'm the luckiest
person on the planet. But yeah,

270
00:15:13,901 --> 00:15:17,920
I think it's just more, um, perspective
really. I think for year, well, you know,

271
00:15:17,921 --> 00:15:21,430
I've been tattooed since I was 14 years
old and I got into my first hat two shot

272
00:15:21,431 --> 00:15:24,010
when I was 16. Um, illegal. We obviously,

273
00:15:24,011 --> 00:15:26,320
and I never went through like
a traditional apprenticeship
or anything like that,

274
00:15:26,321 --> 00:15:27,940
but then, um, this,

275
00:15:27,941 --> 00:15:31,690
this funny idea for a TV show
happened when I was like 21,

276
00:15:31,691 --> 00:15:34,510
22 and it changed the dynamics of things.
You know,

277
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:37,630
at the time I was drinking and partying
a lot. And so I'm sober now, but, um,

278
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:42,790
it was like, I almost had resentment
towards people, uh, you know,

279
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:45,490
after doing like a lot of the
same stuff over and over again,

280
00:15:45,491 --> 00:15:49,750
and the expectations that come in and
kind of like rapes the art at times,

281
00:15:49,751 --> 00:15:52,570
you know, because you just want to, I
mean, for me, I just wanted to create,

282
00:15:52,571 --> 00:15:55,900
I just wanted to draw her tattoo
and do my best and then, you know,

283
00:15:55,901 --> 00:15:58,620
the story behind the Tattoo
and all that. It just, it,

284
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:01,090
it gets pretty heavy after a
while, but then, uh, you know,

285
00:16:01,091 --> 00:16:06,091
something flipped and I saw
each opportunity or each
tattoo as an opportunity to

286
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,060
connect with people, you
know? And I think, I think
I'm always looking for that.

287
00:16:10,061 --> 00:16:12,340
You know, I, I sound
like a Hippie, but like,

288
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:16,720
I like making people feel good
about things and about life,

289
00:16:16,721 --> 00:16:18,550
whether it's about death or whatever.

290
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:22,900
It does sound like a Hippie, but it's
beautiful. But you know, it's like, it's,

291
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:27,030
it's a weird thing that we, we mock stuff
like that. I don't, I mean, I just, I'm,

292
00:16:27,031 --> 00:16:29,930
I'm locking myself more than anything
because I catch myself sounding that way.

293
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,810
I do as well. Yeah. I catch myself
sounding like a retard. I'm like,

294
00:16:32,811 --> 00:16:35,840
what are you talking about?
Idealistic fool or ethnicity,

295
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,930
but that would be the best way to live
if we all could figure out how to tune in

296
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:40,040
like that and everybody could,

297
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:44,720
I feel like I'm always at my most creative
when I'm being generous and kind and

298
00:16:44,721 --> 00:16:48,650
nice to as many people as possible.
Yeah. Experienced, uh, you know, a,

299
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:52,820
a good connectivity with all the
human beings interact with. Totally.

300
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:55,190
You feel better.
You feel like it's working better.

301
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,610
Why don't you recognize your power as it?
Yeah.

302
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:01,920
Individual, you know, and I think like
intentions are really important. You know,

303
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:05,710
there's like this, this little thing that
I do and I think I've only told like,

304
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:08,620
uh, like one person about it.
At the end of every tattoo,

305
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:11,720
I put this paper towel
on the Tattoo and I,

306
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:15,610
I put like witch Hazel, which is
like a natural astringent and stuff.

307
00:17:15,611 --> 00:17:16,031
And it's like,

308
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:20,110
I always like hold my hands over it for
a minute and I do think that the client,

309
00:17:20,111 --> 00:17:22,270
most of the time thinks I'm just
like cleaning it off or something.

310
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:25,730
But in my mind I'm thinking
like several words then,

311
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,510
and this is really going to
sound like a crazy, I dunno,

312
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:33,610
like Voodoo hippie thing,
but I just think these three words and um,

313
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:36,430
and it's like a transfer
of energy and whatever.

314
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,490
Well, the three words,
oh, I'm telling you,

315
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:42,400
you can't tell me the three words
really where they secret. Yeah, I'm on.

316
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,580
They're just words. Why would you know
it's impossible. The color matching,

317
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,460
it's impossible to collection.
It's like Rainbow Chicken Salad.

318
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:55,260
No, I want to hear it. Why can't
you tell us? It's just words.

319
00:17:56,610 --> 00:18:00,720
Just words. Just kidding. Well, I
mean, I think that would help people.

320
00:18:00,721 --> 00:18:03,600
You fire them up whenever they
started doing that with their life.

321
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:08,700
Well, I mean [inaudible] mantras and stuff
and you know, whatever works for you.

322
00:18:08,701 --> 00:18:13,540
If they want to try the Kat von d mantra,
it's so successful shirts,

323
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:16,540
then forget it when maybe you have
some magic. She like, you have it up.

324
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:18,560
Do you have magic? We all
have magic. But, um, no,

325
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:21,480
the purpose of being is that
there's like intention behind every,

326
00:18:21,481 --> 00:18:23,970
every everything you do.
And um,

327
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,210
and I think that's really important
because there is like a physical aspect of

328
00:18:27,211 --> 00:18:29,670
energy, you know, when people are like,
oh, like vibes and all that stuff,

329
00:18:29,671 --> 00:18:31,700
there's actual energy that you're
putting out into the world. So,

330
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:34,940
and focus, I mean, we all know
when someone's not focusing on us,

331
00:18:34,941 --> 00:18:35,970
when you're having a conversation,

332
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:38,100
when they're looking at their phone
or doing something else. Yeah.

333
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:40,060
Meet people and they're just like,

334
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,720
they're just dickheads or they're angry
or they're having a bad day or it's hot

335
00:18:43,721 --> 00:18:44,470
or whatever.

336
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:49,210
And I have like witnessed it before
where I can like bring presence or

337
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,940
positivity into a situation,
you know? Or it's like, uh,

338
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,040
I recognize my power to do that.
And it's like,

339
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,460
I remember one time I was driving
down the brand, like I got a,

340
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:00,610
the chick behind me wasn't
paying attention and she
totally crashed into my car.

341
00:19:00,611 --> 00:19:04,360
And then the guy behind her wasn't paying
attention and he crashed into her and

342
00:19:04,361 --> 00:19:06,430
his airbags went off and all this
shit, you know? And I'm like,

343
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,800
my car is like pretty
stealth is not going to get,

344
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,550
I don't even think I got a ding on it,
you know?

345
00:19:10,551 --> 00:19:14,320
And the cars behind me were just like
tin cans and I just remember going to

346
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:15,100
getting out of the car.

347
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:18,420
I mean I'm wearing like full leather and
just like you can just like, you know,

348
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:21,190
and that could be pretty
intimidating and I'm like, oh, okay,

349
00:19:21,191 --> 00:19:24,430
I'm going to consciously like make
these people feel okay. You know?

350
00:19:24,431 --> 00:19:27,940
And like she rolled down her window,
she's like, oh. And I remember going, Hey,

351
00:19:27,941 --> 00:19:29,490
are you okay?
And just like looking at her and I,

352
00:19:29,491 --> 00:19:30,970
and like asking her if she's okay and she,

353
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,730
she just like softened and
after like what kill me.

354
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:34,151
Yeah.

355
00:19:34,151 --> 00:19:39,151
By the end of the crazy gang
banger check ham damage.

356
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:40,301
Yeah.

357
00:19:40,301 --> 00:19:44,240
If I was a check I'd be so bummed out if
I remember when did you and the and to

358
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:45,690
know afterwards we were
all laughing about it.

359
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,610
I think that we have the power to do that.

360
00:19:48,611 --> 00:19:51,700
Most people get all like up in arms
about things and I just realized I wrote

361
00:19:51,701 --> 00:19:54,880
something and when I was a kid that the
nothing has any meaning other than the

362
00:19:54,881 --> 00:19:55,930
meaning that you give it.
Yeah,

363
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:58,970
just totally and you could
force things to be positive.

364
00:19:58,971 --> 00:20:02,020
If you can force all negative situations
to be opportunities for growth,

365
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:06,030
you know you can, you can, you can
live your life like that. Totally.

366
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:08,620
Where it can be a fuckhead just
slam it into walls everywhere and,

367
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:12,220
and live in misery. Never
figure it out. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

368
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,080
You forgot your first
tattoo when you were 16

369
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:18,790
I got my first to one was 14 actually.
Holy was it good? Yeah. I still have it.

370
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:20,530
It's like a little j on my ankle.

371
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:24,880
It was for my first love ever and we
did it for like three years and wow,

372
00:20:24,881 --> 00:20:27,280
that's intense. Yeah. Run, ran away. Like,

373
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,950
who does the cross the
country in a greyhound bus.

374
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:32,200
How old were you when you did that?
Uh,

375
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:36,150
but then I was 15 when I'm all across and
then I was already tattooing and stuff.

376
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:40,810
So Jesus Christ, yeah, you got now
you could put a z under it and,

377
00:20:40,811 --> 00:20:43,690
and put 99 problems in
quotes and I don't know that,

378
00:20:43,691 --> 00:20:47,050
but I just tell people it stands
for Jesus or just kidding.

379
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,470
Just kidding. That's funny. Yeah.

380
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,580
Wow.
That's a really young age to be

381
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:59,120
traveling. I know my portrait Aaron's
man and I had a hard time, like, uh,

382
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:02,550
I think forgiving myself for a long time
because I'm really close with my dad

383
00:21:02,551 --> 00:21:05,420
and stuff. He actually like lived
with me up until recently and um,

384
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:08,400
he got his own place and I was
pretty bummed about that. But yeah,

385
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:10,980
at the time I was like, Oh, you know, I
never want to hurt anybody's feelings.

386
00:21:10,981 --> 00:21:13,530
I just really felt like
the need to do this,

387
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,930
this thing that my family
didn't understand, you know,

388
00:21:15,931 --> 00:21:17,880
and they're from a different
culture, like I said, and stuff.

389
00:21:17,881 --> 00:21:20,820
So they weren't really prepared for it.
You know, they just seem like tattooing,

390
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:23,130
oh my God,
you're like a hoodlum or gangster,

391
00:21:23,131 --> 00:21:26,670
a drug addict or a hooker or whatever.
Yeah, I was none of the above.

392
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,250
So they never put in their head,
you're doing tattoos. Boom,

393
00:21:31,251 --> 00:21:33,440
you're going to be some
crazy famous check.

394
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:37,400
No, I mean, you know, and
we were, we lived a really
isolated world. Like you know,

395
00:21:37,401 --> 00:21:40,820
the way we were brought up was not
very Americanized. It also like, which,

396
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,700
which I'm glad because I feel like that
that's really honestly the one things I

397
00:21:44,701 --> 00:21:47,570
credit to like being able to do all things
I've done is just like the discipline.

398
00:21:47,571 --> 00:21:50,390
And you know, the three of
us, my brother, sister and I,

399
00:21:50,391 --> 00:21:54,260
we were all like classically trained
on the piano since I was six. And um,

400
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:54,681
you know,

401
00:21:54,681 --> 00:21:58,580
two hours a day we had a practice and
when we would rather be like hanging out

402
00:21:58,581 --> 00:22:02,240
and stuff and we were like waiting for
it to like afford like video games and

403
00:22:02,241 --> 00:22:03,074
shit like that.
So,

404
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:06,860
so I drew all the time and spent time
with my family and stuff and so for that

405
00:22:06,861 --> 00:22:10,970
I'm grateful. I feel like that discipline
really plays into like executing ideas.

406
00:22:10,971 --> 00:22:13,970
You know, I have do millions of ideas
at all times, you know, and just like,

407
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:17,690
I think a lot of people have ideas
and they just think it's, I don't,

408
00:22:17,691 --> 00:22:20,570
they've been programmed to think
it's not like a table or something,

409
00:22:20,571 --> 00:22:21,404
which is silly to me.

410
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,021
Yeah.

411
00:22:22,021 --> 00:22:25,560
Well there's that Hump that you have to
get over in associating pleasure with

412
00:22:25,561 --> 00:22:26,394
getting things done.

413
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:30,610
Yeah. And also I think too, it's like
people's idea of success is so warped,

414
00:22:30,611 --> 00:22:34,360
you know, it's like they base it on
money or status or fame and, and,

415
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:36,220
and to be honest with you,
when I started tattooing,

416
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:37,240
I didn't even know it was a job.

417
00:22:37,241 --> 00:22:41,710
I just knew it felt organic and
it felt like natural, not, not,

418
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,660
it didn't come to me naturally.
I worked really hard for it,

419
00:22:43,661 --> 00:22:46,570
but it felt like this is where I was
supposed to be. You know, and ever,

420
00:22:46,571 --> 00:22:49,810
and this is granted before
like a television show and
stuff. It was, you know,

421
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:50,950
I just came from Disneyland.

422
00:22:50,951 --> 00:22:54,540
It was like if I were to have gotten
to design back then like, you know,

423
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:57,160
you don't get happy smiles and stuff,
you know,

424
00:22:57,161 --> 00:23:01,150
I had so many Julia Roberts moments going
into stores. It's like, can we help you?

425
00:23:01,151 --> 00:23:04,420
You know? And I'm just like, oh, like
I could buy this place. Like I bet no.

426
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:08,010
So they just immediately judge you.
That's our common theme

427
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:11,650
when I was younger. Yeah. I mean
nowadays it's so like embraced, you know,

428
00:23:11,651 --> 00:23:15,850
I mean if my dad who was
super anti tattoos and it
doesn't have any or anything,

429
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,600
um, you know, it took 10
years of me tattooed cause I,

430
00:23:18,601 --> 00:23:23,110
I started tattooing on that TV show
when not after 10 years of tattooing.

431
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:27,470
So it took a television show for
my dad to actually, um, you know,

432
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:30,250
acknowledge the fact that I wasn't
like not a loser, but you know,

433
00:23:30,251 --> 00:23:33,820
like that I wasn't throwing my
life away. Then he's like, oh,

434
00:23:33,821 --> 00:23:36,310
and sometimes it takes that. I don't
hold that against my dad. I mean,

435
00:23:36,311 --> 00:23:37,200
I don't blame them.
Really.

436
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:37,670
Yeah.

437
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:42,670
You've influenced a lot of checks
and like how they look like you've,

438
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:46,100
you was our first one that like pop

439
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,330
through and boys,

440
00:23:47,331 --> 00:23:52,331
Joe the first one who was like a really
hot chick who just tattooed herself the

441
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:56,480
fuck up. It's like, Whoa, this check went
for it. And, and, and, and guys were like,

442
00:23:56,660 --> 00:24:00,710
I like it. I like it. And then
boom. Then there was a wave of them.

443
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,770
It was you.
And then it was like everywhere you look,

444
00:24:03,771 --> 00:24:06,950
there's this crazy tattooed up girls.
Like the percentage of it,

445
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:11,030
I don't know what, I don't
know. I'll, I'll put a number
on it. Increase by like 30,

446
00:24:11,031 --> 00:24:12,140
40,
50%.

447
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:16,990
It went from however minimal amount of
women tattooed to like one out of three

448
00:24:16,991 --> 00:24:21,070
women had, have tattoos in America
and that was like back at sea. Uh,

449
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,440
I remember that stat when I
did the Ellen degeneres show,

450
00:24:23,441 --> 00:24:24,520
which was like years ago.

451
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:27,200
That's hilarious. Do you look at
the stats? Like we're winning,

452
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,530
we're taking over them? No,
no, no, no, because I never, I,

453
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:33,210
well, you know, I mean, I have friends
that have no tattoos and they're like,

454
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:36,240
feel the need to get one. I'm like, I
don't know. Like, you are where you are,

455
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:40,620
you know? It's good. I mean,
I get tattooed for myself
personally. You know, it's, um,

456
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:44,220
if anything, it's kind of, it's kind of
a drag some to, I don't really feel like,

457
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:47,850
you know, always talking about my tattoos
I get when I'm going out and stuff,

458
00:24:47,851 --> 00:24:51,750
but it's also a positive thing, so I
can't complain. You know? I love art, so.

459
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:53,500
Yeah. Yeah. It's,

460
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:56,650
it's a weird thing with people if either
they either have them when they don't

461
00:24:56,651 --> 00:24:59,930
have them. If they don't have, they could
never imagine. Oh, can never imagined,

462
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,280
never imagined drunk something.
It's just a tiny forever aside girls,

463
00:25:03,281 --> 00:25:07,840
they owe you big time. You blew
that, that company up. Right. Well,

464
00:25:07,841 --> 00:25:10,880
that whole look, yeah,
they need a worship. You

465
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:16,130
Dude, the, the, the guy who came up with
that whole concept, but a while ago.

466
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:19,580
Do you feel weird about that?
And like that you've, I mean,

467
00:25:19,581 --> 00:25:21,770
that's gotta be a strange thing
to have so much influence.

468
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:26,740
Um, you know, I think, uh, I may not have
recognized it when I first started, um,

469
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:31,810
you know, being in the public
eye or whatever, it's as,
as that until I got sober,

470
00:25:31,811 --> 00:25:36,811
I think I really started recognizing
that and it became important to me.

471
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:41,350
You know, I'm pretty PG 13,
just by nature, you know,
I'm pretty squeaky clean.

472
00:25:41,351 --> 00:25:41,950
I don't,

473
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:46,180
you could take my phone and go through
it and find pictures of my cat and stuff

474
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:51,180
and probably not anything
incriminating. But, um, um, I,

475
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:55,720
I like the idea of like, uh, putting that
good, good stuff out there. You know,

476
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:57,310
like all my books and everything, I, it's,

477
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:01,300
it's really easy for me to talk about
my downfalls or like my issues are not

478
00:26:01,301 --> 00:26:04,560
struggles cause that sounds like a murder
or something. But like, you know, the,

479
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:08,880
the, the Shit I've experienced
it in hopes that, I dunno,

480
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:11,830
people would feel less alone because I
know what it's like to feel that way. So,

481
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:13,323
you know,
I dunno.

482
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:16,590
That's what a lot of people say about
people that are covered in tattoos.

483
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,570
And if you'd never,
I have two sleeves,

484
00:26:18,571 --> 00:26:21,460
if you in case you think
I'm being an asshole, they,

485
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:24,060
they feel like a lot of
people don't have tattoos.

486
00:26:24,061 --> 00:26:25,890
Feel like you're covering something up.

487
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:30,560
Oh yeah. I remember doctor drew and I had
a conversation about that cause he, um,

488
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:32,330
I love this book that he wrote.
Um,

489
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:36,170
and in it talked about
how tattooing is like a,

490
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:40,700
a form of narcissism, not unlike a
level of uh, oh, I think I'm awesome,

491
00:26:40,701 --> 00:26:44,790
but the opposite, which is narcissism just
the same. But um, you know, like it's,

492
00:26:44,791 --> 00:26:48,750
it's a reflection of what it's a on the
inside and I don't really necessarily

493
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,230
see it that way because that to me, yeah,
there's some tattoos that hold meaning.

494
00:26:52,231 --> 00:26:55,590
Like I love my dad, I got a portrait
of my arm that's self explanatory.

495
00:26:55,591 --> 00:26:58,980
But there's other stuff I like my
friends who don't know how to draw,

496
00:26:58,981 --> 00:27:01,410
like tattoo me. It looks like a drunk
in three year old did something.

497
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:04,950
And I love it because it's just fun
and it's cool. And I don't really care.

498
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:09,360
You know, you let your friends
draw on you. I let them
tell to me, which is bigger,

499
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:13,020
like a bigger deal. Yeah. But I'm
done to Drew's is silly bitch.

500
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:18,180
I love him too, but he's a silly bitch.
I need to get him on the podcast.

501
00:27:18,181 --> 00:27:21,170
I saw him the other day at the gas
station. Get them on, I'll get them on. I,

502
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:22,023
you know,

503
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:27,080
he's been involved in that scandal for
influencing the idea that people bought

504
00:27:27,931 --> 00:27:29,880
some certain drugs off label,

505
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:34,620
like saying touting their sexual benefits
and stuff and then we'll talk crap

506
00:27:34,621 --> 00:27:38,340
about marijuana or people smoke pot and
it, he'll say silly things like that.

507
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:43,040
The horribly addictive it is. And it's
all just nonsense. I don't, you know,

508
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:44,670
I haven't,
like I said earlier,

509
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:48,480
I haven't known to television and it
was 16 years in March and I'm pretty

510
00:27:48,481 --> 00:27:52,110
adamant about not watching television.
Um, my point, I don't know, but, but,

511
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:55,200
but you know, I get what you're saying
that I can't tell you why you're getting,

512
00:27:55,201 --> 00:27:57,930
you can't say that. You're just
not enjoying the art. He can't,

513
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:03,200
I know people love their tattoos and
love it for the person and you know,

514
00:28:03,751 --> 00:28:05,820
yeah. Like I do. I of course
we all have issues and stuff.

515
00:28:05,821 --> 00:28:09,090
I have no problem like wearing my
heart on my sleeve. And I mean,

516
00:28:09,091 --> 00:28:10,980
I've actually gotten a lot of shit
for that, you know what I mean?

517
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:14,210
In the past and stuff with
relationships and I just don't,

518
00:28:14,211 --> 00:28:17,590
I don't really live in that
world of regret or really
giving a fuck. So, you know,

519
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:21,210
I just hate absolutes like that,
like, and how you have to be the up,

520
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:25,290
you have to be this, you have to do that.
It's, it gets silly with certain things.

521
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:29,230
I mean, I think no one's perfect
either, so I feel like, you know,

522
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,440
I can see the goodness in everything.

523
00:28:31,441 --> 00:28:33,740
Even the stuff I don't
necessarily agree with, you know,

524
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:38,510
I guess I tried to at least,
right. Yeah. Yeah. I just, I would,

525
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,990
I would like to look at things that way.

526
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,750
I would like to look at people
with tattoos and just, you know,

527
00:28:42,751 --> 00:28:45,240
I don't know why anybody got him,
but I look at them and go, wow,

528
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:48,000
I hope you like it. I hope it's something
that means something. You would hope.

529
00:28:48,001 --> 00:28:50,850
It's something everybody
had for whatever reason,

530
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,000
wants to immediately try to figure out
what was fucked up with you that made you

531
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:00,510
get to the place where you enjoy that
like totally corporate and working in a

532
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:05,310
cubicle that's miserable. And there's
like suppression of like, of creativity.

533
00:29:05,311 --> 00:29:08,520
Like, man, that's such a waste
of life energy. You know,

534
00:29:08,521 --> 00:29:13,220
like imagine if everybody was free to do
things like, um, as they, you know, like,

535
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:15,930
like I was talking about earlier,
people's idea of success. It's like,

536
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,970
imagine if you didn't,

537
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:21,360
you weren't bound by like everybody
else's idea of that, you know,

538
00:29:21,361 --> 00:29:25,140
like if you could settle for a job that
paid less but you were completely happy.

539
00:29:25,141 --> 00:29:27,660
I mean, my dad and I, we used to argue
about this all the time because he's like,

540
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:31,020
you know, you didn't go to
high school. And then it's
like, yeah, I know dad. I know,

541
00:29:31,021 --> 00:29:32,040
but check it out.

542
00:29:32,041 --> 00:29:36,090
Like you went two years of school and
you don't like what you do and you're

543
00:29:36,091 --> 00:29:40,290
struggling so hard. And my dad comes from
a medical background and stuff, but um,

544
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,040
and I was on

545
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:46,480
my way to work every day and I walked
down like the tarnished fucking Hollywood

546
00:29:46,481 --> 00:29:48,880
stars, you know, like just
walking. I'm like, oh my God,

547
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:51,940
there's like a bunch of punk rockers
there. And it's like, ah, it's just,

548
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,600
life is good. Like I love it. I don't, you
know, and, and if I wasn't getting paid,

549
00:29:55,601 --> 00:29:59,770
I'd still be happy. There's a documentary
that Warner Herzog just put out.

550
00:29:59,771 --> 00:30:03,100
It's called the happy
people a year in the taiga.

551
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:07,960
It's these people that live up in
Siberia and how happy they are.

552
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,970
And there's like no depression.

553
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,930
Everybody just does their work and
all their whole life is struggle.

554
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:17,500
Their whole life is all they live off
the land almost completely any entirely

555
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:21,250
trapping hunting. And uh, they're,
they're in fucking Siberia.

556
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,450
There's only one way to get there.

557
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:24,550
You have a couple of months we
could take a boat. That's it.

558
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:26,160
Otherwise you've got to get flown in.

559
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:29,020
There's no roads to get up there
and these people are happy as fuck.

560
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,670
They're just up there, you know, like
shooting animals, living off the land,

561
00:30:33,671 --> 00:30:35,020
growing their own vegetables.

562
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,670
They have to work hard in the spring
and summer to prepare for the winter and

563
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,860
then they prepare for the
winter like smoking fish.

564
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:47,010
I mean every day no one has a job every
day they're working like securing food

565
00:30:47,591 --> 00:30:50,740
for their families and storing it up so
they can make it through the next winter.

566
00:30:50,741 --> 00:30:52,400
I mean,
it's amazing.

567
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:55,900
It's not really that different than
living in Hollywood and people who do that

568
00:30:55,901 --> 00:30:58,030
in their own ways. It's
just, yeah, it's just more,

569
00:30:58,031 --> 00:30:59,830
I feel like it's more than what that,
yeah,

570
00:30:59,831 --> 00:31:03,970
it sounds so much more simple and like
less thought about like here it's like

571
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,720
the stress of getting to work and fighting
three hours of traffic to get to a

572
00:31:07,721 --> 00:31:11,310
job that I don't respect her
love and you know, it's there,

573
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:15,230
you're still suffering or whatever for
something. You know what I mean? Well,

574
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:18,610
something happened somewhere along
the line somewhere along the way.

575
00:31:18,611 --> 00:31:22,810
And Society and our culture moved
way faster than the human body did.

576
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:26,410
And all of a sudden jobs
required you to sit still.

577
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:29,530
They required you to stare
at fucking unnatural light.

578
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:32,640
They required you to enter in things
and you're fucking backwards and you're

579
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:36,100
doing it all day every day.
Like the body's not designed for that.

580
00:31:36,101 --> 00:31:38,920
The body's designed to do with these
fucking people in Siberia are doing,

581
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:42,730
it's designed to go out and
kill Caribou and, and you know,

582
00:31:42,731 --> 00:31:46,510
have dogs chained to trees and they
keep the bears away. I mean that's,

583
00:31:46,511 --> 00:31:50,950
these guys are happy as fuck and this
is the real way we're supposed to live.

584
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,650
It's crazy. They hate it.
Well they don't though.

585
00:31:53,651 --> 00:31:58,651
See what I'm saying is that like we all
have our little receptors I think are

586
00:31:59,081 --> 00:32:02,080
set up for road to reward
us for certain experiences.

587
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:05,950
I don't think we're set up any different
than the people that lived when you had

588
00:32:05,951 --> 00:32:06,820
to live like that.

589
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:11,970
So I think the only way to really not
feel lost is there's no fucking movie star

590
00:32:12,341 --> 00:32:14,080
status when you're in Siberia.

591
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,740
There's no front of the line of the
club generated. There's no bullshit.

592
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:20,650
There's no nothing.
There's no head of 10th Planet Jiu Jitsu.

593
00:32:20,651 --> 00:32:23,890
There's no standup comedian. There's
no nothing. There's get a fish.

594
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:26,710
You got to get a fish because we're
going to fucking die in the winter if you

595
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:30,950
don't, and everybody does that, but yet
they're all happy and shit. They, there's,

596
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:35,080
even when you were a kid and you like
you like thought of like where you were

597
00:32:35,081 --> 00:32:38,170
like, well, we'll never, I'll never live
there. I'm never going to move there.

598
00:32:38,171 --> 00:32:40,130
I'm not.
I'm never going to out of this class

599
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:43,100
and they're never going to get out of this
situation. This is where I'm at. Well,

600
00:32:43,101 --> 00:32:48,101
for them it's a reality where they're
surrounded by nature and woods like there

601
00:32:48,501 --> 00:32:49,700
really is no alternatives,

602
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:54,860
so they have no delusions
is no ridiculousness in
their life and the truly in

603
00:32:54,861 --> 00:32:58,770
the moment living like people were
living 10,000 plus years ago. Yeah,

604
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,430
that's how we're supposed to live.
So we're fucking ourselves up.

605
00:33:01,431 --> 00:33:05,150
If they had TV bullshit. How long do you
think it would take one generator TV?

606
00:33:05,151 --> 00:33:07,160
They'd be out of there in a minute.
The kids were like,

607
00:33:07,161 --> 00:33:09,920
what are we doing out
here? Yeah, going to MTV,

608
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:13,420
Kat von d would change the
way they all look mommy.

609
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,870
And one month they'd all want tattoos.

610
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:18,290
They'd be a make it homemade
tattoos of beaver teeth and shit.

611
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:21,480
They would start that dude the Siberia.

612
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:27,200
We were at the, uh, the
coffee place and uh,

613
00:33:27,201 --> 00:33:31,370
we're having small talk with the Nice
lady behind the counter and she said, oh,

614
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:35,330
I had a house sit this weekend. It was
terrible. They didn't even have cable,

615
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:40,130
no Internet. And me and Eddie
were like, well, but we were
being serious. Whoa, whoa.

616
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:44,300
No cable. What the fuck? So what
do you use antenna? That sucks.

617
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:48,290
And then Eddie goes, well, at least he
got the Internet. And she's like, no, no,

618
00:33:48,291 --> 00:33:52,080
they didn't even have the
Internet. He's, what is thought TV?

619
00:33:52,081 --> 00:33:54,020
You can just get on the Internet.
These guys don't even have,

620
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:58,550
they don't even have electricity
in. They're happy. They
don't have electricity,

621
00:33:58,551 --> 00:33:59,720
man.
They just don't know.

622
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:03,470
They get a little bit of gasoline that
they use for their snowmobiles and their

623
00:34:03,471 --> 00:34:05,630
chainsaws and that's a wrap.
That's it.

624
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:09,290
They probably think they're bawling like
the lower class of them who lived in

625
00:34:09,291 --> 00:34:11,960
the hills and there's no class man.
That's what's crazy.

626
00:34:11,961 --> 00:34:16,010
They all live in the exact same houses.
They don't even use windows man.

627
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:19,070
They don't use windows because
windows are too hard to carry around.

628
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:23,420
So they build these houses at a log and
then they cut holes in the logs and put

629
00:34:23,421 --> 00:34:27,560
plastic and nail plastic in place.
It bears,

630
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:31,200
bears rip them apart so often
those damn bears, I swear.

631
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:35,330
What are they going to get class anyway?
What's hard to transport?

632
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:38,590
They could bring shit. They
got of chainsaws. They did.

633
00:34:38,591 --> 00:34:40,250
Then I'm making their own chain saws.

634
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:44,540
They somehow or another got chainsaws
either taking them on a boat or flown in.

635
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:48,890
Somebody gave them a few tools, but
they like make, they make boats with,

636
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:51,320
with a fucking big piece of wood.
It,

637
00:34:51,321 --> 00:34:54,870
just drop it down and hollow it out and
make this canoe and let's like it's,

638
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:56,600
that's how they live every year.

639
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,090
It does never change and
yet their happiest fuck.

640
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:03,470
It's really weird because to us it would
be hell to the lady who works at the

641
00:35:03,471 --> 00:35:06,320
coffee place, she was bumming
out that she didn't have cable.

642
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:09,380
You know these motherfuckers
are fighting them on the ski.

643
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:13,640
Those like you've never seen because
of mosquitoes are only alive for like a

644
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,800
couple of months. They only got a
couple months of Siberia to live.

645
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:20,570
So they go gangster Chung. It swarms like
you'll never seen anything like that.

646
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:24,320
And they don't have any raid or any
shit like that. So they have to the off,

647
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:27,830
they have to cover themselves in tar.
They make a tar with bark,

648
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:32,140
they cook the bark down to a tar and
then rub it all over their face with like

649
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:36,650
oil. Fuck that. Fuck that
Nigga. Fuck that shit.

650
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:39,440
You've never seen mosquitoes like this.
That's horror.

651
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:41,400
Well that's one of the
beautiful things about La.

652
00:35:41,401 --> 00:35:44,760
Say we're not supposed to be here,
so life doesn't like it here either.

653
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:47,790
There's not that much here without
without us. Some of the much water.

654
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:52,560
There's very few bugs. Yeah, there's
very few bugs. Like in the summers in,

655
00:35:52,561 --> 00:35:56,260
in the east coast, it was
fucking terrible. You know?
Especially like in, uh,

656
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:00,470
in Boston, if you lived anywhere near a
lake, anywhere near a body of water, oh,

657
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:05,250
the mosquitoes were horrendous, man. They
would fuck you up. Nothing like Siberia,

658
00:36:05,251 --> 00:36:09,720
Dude. Shit. Get, they're so
happy. Yeah. But then again,

659
00:36:09,721 --> 00:36:13,140
you wouldn't be happy that way. You
wouldn't be having, no, you wouldn't, not.

660
00:36:13,141 --> 00:36:16,320
If you know your life now, you
love tattooing, you love, you know,

661
00:36:16,321 --> 00:36:20,610
you love them to find me. I mean,
that's true. You could adapt. Yeah,

662
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:23,940
of course you can. Do you think
you could be a Siberian princess?

663
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,090
I don't know if I'm
wanting to be a princess,

664
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:29,100
but be up there beaver trapping
and shit. A warrior. Yeah.

665
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:31,980
That'd be cool for the first
couple of months a year. Fuck it.

666
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:35,370
We go live with them until
you realize they have no
cigarettes. You're like, shit,

667
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,140
I want a cigarette so bad.

668
00:36:40,141 --> 00:36:43,940
You're like that for two days and someone
will give you some rolled up bullshit

669
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:45,330
that tries to claims a cigarette,

670
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:50,330
one issue of inked magazine
would destroy that culture. Oh,

671
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:52,510
anything would destroy it.
Access to

672
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:53,870
some of things would destroy it.

673
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:58,940
The idea is that it takes
the body somewhere between
10 and maybe even possibly

674
00:36:58,941 --> 00:37:02,330
20,000 or more years to completely change,

675
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,750
like to completely change
as far as like, um, uh,

676
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:08,090
if for you to have a like a,

677
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:13,270
like a genetic response to a and to
adaptation to change to like 10,000 years

678
00:37:13,371 --> 00:37:16,460
for us is not a long,
long time to a human being.

679
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:18,890
But to species it's really not that much.

680
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:21,800
So in order for things to like decide
that they're moving in a certain

681
00:37:21,801 --> 00:37:23,570
directions,
then they start changing.

682
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:27,230
And that's one of the things that like
the really controversial ideas behind

683
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:32,260
autism is that autism is
not necessarily a benefit,

684
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:38,140
but that autism might be a new possible
way that the brain can operate.

685
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:42,460
You know, with some like really
high functioning autistics.

686
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:45,500
It's like what they're showing is like
even though it's coming through in a

687
00:37:45,501 --> 00:37:46,890
disease and even know it,

688
00:37:46,891 --> 00:37:50,000
it beings with it debilitating
social issues and shit like that.

689
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:51,650
The positive aspects of it,

690
00:37:51,651 --> 00:37:55,520
like a kid that can look out a window
and then draw the whole fucking skyline.

691
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:56,690
Yeah.

692
00:37:56,690 --> 00:38:00,950
That what that is is representing the
next stage of human evolution and that all

693
00:38:00,951 --> 00:38:03,590
the information that we're getting
from sit in front of computers from

694
00:38:03,591 --> 00:38:06,200
interacting with each other in a way that
no one has ever been able to do before.

695
00:38:06,201 --> 00:38:07,070
The brain is just going,

696
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,700
we're just red line in that motherfucker.

697
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,810
Be able to buy that upgrade can
imagine that just being like, oh,

698
00:38:13,811 --> 00:38:16,050
I was going to be available Bryan Hill.
It's to be a pill.

699
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:18,690
It's just going to be like, oh, we're
going to fuck up your brain a little.

700
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:22,530
Mostly most likely if you listen
to like the real futurists,

701
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:26,370
it's going to be some sort of a
hybrid between a human and a computer.

702
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,490
It'll be something where you'd
be long gone by then, so,

703
00:38:29,491 --> 00:38:33,090
but I don't know about that unless
I'm autism pills. I don't think so.

704
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,980
I don't think you'll be long gone.
I think you might experience

705
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,320
that and I don't necessarily
think it's a bad thing.

706
00:38:38,321 --> 00:38:43,030
I think everybody's worried about every
new possible technological thing as

707
00:38:43,031 --> 00:38:45,750
being something that separates
us from each other or something

708
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:48,350
I'm worried about it is,
it's just seems like a lot of,

709
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:53,340
a lot of energy to waste on thinking
about. I don't know. I mean, I then again,

710
00:38:53,341 --> 00:38:57,780
you know, I'm not like a big
fan of like reading fiction,
you know? I guess, I mean,

711
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:01,110
you're not a fan of fiction.
You don't, you don't even
have a television, right? No.

712
00:39:01,111 --> 00:39:04,050
I mean I have like a movie
screen that can watch movies.

713
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:07,440
You watch movies but no cheese. Yes. I
like documentaries and stuff like that.

714
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:10,530
But you try to avoid
TV? No, I do avoid TV.

715
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:14,580
I don't like forced advertisement
and it don't like, um, well, no,

716
00:39:14,581 --> 00:39:19,200
I don't want to complain. I just think
that I will tell you what is you're on it.

717
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:24,510
No, I mean I can, no, I come to you
could, you can get, wait you mean,

718
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:26,250
I mean I could easily,
I could more.

719
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:31,550
It's easier for me to talk shit about
like point out all the downfalls of my

720
00:39:32,101 --> 00:39:33,570
television show versus anyone else.

721
00:39:33,571 --> 00:39:37,350
So like in vague terms I think
that my problem with it or my,

722
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:40,140
the reason that I stay away from it,
aside from just being,

723
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:43,980
I got too many ideas that I want to do
and I don't have time but like is that I

724
00:39:43,981 --> 00:39:48,750
am too sensitive. So like I, I get
like I get heartbroken by billboards.

725
00:39:48,751 --> 00:39:50,970
Like seriously,
there was like a movie,

726
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:53,640
I remember there was like a movie
and had billboards everywhere.

727
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:55,620
I don't remember the movie.
It was like, you know,

728
00:39:55,621 --> 00:39:58,640
Ashton Kutcher and some like hot
chick or whatever and like, and, and,

729
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:01,050
and he's like putting on
buttoning up his shirt.

730
00:40:01,051 --> 00:40:03,870
She's like buttoning up and she's wearing
his shirt and she's like getting out

731
00:40:03,871 --> 00:40:07,500
of bed and it says something about like
no strings attached or like friends with

732
00:40:07,501 --> 00:40:10,980
benefits or some shit. And I was
like, like that's so sad to me.

733
00:40:10,981 --> 00:40:11,910
Like it's like the opposite.

734
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:16,950
Like you guys just like have sex with
each other and there's no like I could

735
00:40:16,951 --> 00:40:21,000
never, I, wow. And you almost
kill fried looking at a billboard.

736
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:23,610
I mean if I think about it too much.
Yeah I do.

737
00:40:23,611 --> 00:40:28,290
So it's like I watch if I were to sit
there and watch these television shows

738
00:40:28,291 --> 00:40:30,540
where the premise is to like,
you know,

739
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:34,410
there's a rich guy and a bunch of girls
are fighting over this guy and they're

740
00:40:34,411 --> 00:40:39,060
using like their tits and ass
too as, as qualities. It's, it's,

741
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:42,750
it's disheartening. So I mean I sound
like an old lady because no you don't.

742
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:46,590
I get it. Good city. I feel that
way. Like an banded circuit city.

743
00:40:46,591 --> 00:40:50,490
It's depressing to me and I get sad.
There's just an absence of true love.

744
00:40:50,491 --> 00:40:53,580
And then I guess the romantic and we
get saddened by that. Same with music.

745
00:40:53,581 --> 00:40:55,580
I can't listen to music. That's too, yeah,

746
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:59,230
you can definitely get affected by some
shit. Especially if you don't know.

747
00:40:59,231 --> 00:41:01,000
It's common,
like any flipping through the channels,

748
00:41:01,001 --> 00:41:04,900
there's some intense fucking
movies on like that you, you know,

749
00:41:04,901 --> 00:41:07,480
you're just flipping through.
Like, I want Straw dogs last night.

750
00:41:07,481 --> 00:41:09,370
Do you know what Straw dogs out?
I haven't seen it.

751
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:15,140
This is insane rape scene in this movie
where I turned on the movie right when

752
00:41:15,461 --> 00:41:18,850
it was going on. I was like,
what fucking movie is this?

753
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:23,050
But for the rest of the night I was
all fucked up. I mean it becomes a,

754
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:26,680
I don't want to say anything
about the moment. The movie's
very good. Um, but it's,

755
00:41:26,681 --> 00:41:29,500
it gets really fucking intense.

756
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:32,500
Whereas like the rest of the night it
was fucked up and I ordinarily wouldn't

757
00:41:32,501 --> 00:41:34,820
have watched it,
but I didn't know what it was.

758
00:41:34,821 --> 00:41:36,980
I was just pressing buttons and then boom,

759
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:40,100
it came on and fuck my head
for the rest of the night.

760
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:43,300
Yeah. And it's weird. I don't think
it's like, we just kind of like tea we,

761
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:47,230
and I think it's like people become so
desensitized and I guess that's the part

762
00:41:47,231 --> 00:41:48,820
that I have a problem with.
You know, like people,

763
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:51,590
you can see it on Twitter you said on
Instagram. So every so negative in me and,

764
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,340
and take any opportunity
to like knock people down.

765
00:41:54,341 --> 00:41:57,490
I've never been from that like
train of thought, you know,

766
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:01,480
cause my parents just raised this a lot
differently and stuff and so it like I

767
00:42:01,481 --> 00:42:04,920
get like I get butthurt really easily.
That's better.

768
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:06,131
No,
you'll,

769
00:42:06,131 --> 00:42:09,640
you'll attract better people that way
and you'll figure out a way to get away

770
00:42:09,641 --> 00:42:10,450
from the people that

771
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:11,530
Oh yeah.
I mean it's,

772
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:15,730
it's like giving that any
values just as bad I think.

773
00:42:15,731 --> 00:42:18,040
But I just want people to be nice.
That's all.

774
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:20,850
Oh,
almost all really expressive people.

775
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:24,150
Anybody who's a artistic
or very expressive,

776
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:28,620
there's always some extreme sensitivity.
And the other side of it is just,

777
00:42:28,621 --> 00:42:31,830
is just, you're intense about everything.
You're probably intense about love.

778
00:42:31,831 --> 00:42:33,280
You probably tense about,
yeah.

779
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:36,260
I mean that's why he cry when he seen
Ashton Kutcher thing. It's your intensity,

780
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:39,730
your, your, your you, you take shit up
to a higher level quicker than most.

781
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,530
Well that's probably one of the,
everything's a symbol.

782
00:42:41,531 --> 00:42:44,110
And then I get sad about that.
So, yeah. But I've been sad.

783
00:42:44,111 --> 00:42:45,880
I've cried during previews,

784
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:51,120
depressing movies like
good burger. What? I Dunno,

785
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:55,960
here's funny over some sad thank
you. Don't encourage them. Sorry,

786
00:42:56,050 --> 00:42:58,850
I'm just doing it. How can you
say that? After all he's done it.

787
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:01,481
But you know,

788
00:43:01,481 --> 00:43:05,980
then there's like those like moments of
brilliance and people are inspiring and

789
00:43:05,981 --> 00:43:08,160
great and do awesome shit.
Yeah,

790
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:11,320
well that's a, that's what we
get off each other the most.

791
00:43:11,321 --> 00:43:14,080
That's the most beautiful thing that
people get from each other as we, we,

792
00:43:14,081 --> 00:43:16,050
you know, we were inspired by
each other. They're like, yeah,

793
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:19,540
I love going to the music because
I'm not musical. I can't do anything.

794
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:22,930
So I love going and watching cause I feel,
I feel like it, it fires me up again.

795
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:27,560
Oh, you go to musicals. No, no, no,
no, no, no, no. I'd love to see music.

796
00:43:27,561 --> 00:43:31,310
I love to see people are forming,
bands perform. I love to see dem.

797
00:43:31,370 --> 00:43:36,110
I love to see people do things that I
have zero skill in that I was impressed

798
00:43:36,111 --> 00:43:40,970
with with our last exchange of emails
with when we were like going back and

799
00:43:40,971 --> 00:43:42,980
forth on band recommendations and stuff.

800
00:43:42,981 --> 00:43:45,260
Cause I had no idea that you were
into this, that kind of stuff.

801
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:48,680
Well the funny thing is he, he
emailed me and he's like, Hey,

802
00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:52,580
I want to know like what are your,
what are you listening to you nowadays?

803
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:55,340
I want to get some new music. And I'm
like, oh man. Like where do you start?

804
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:57,980
Give me a genre, you know? And so that
turned me on to so many good stuff.

805
00:43:57,981 --> 00:43:58,641
And I was like,
all right here,

806
00:43:58,641 --> 00:44:01,610
here's like 10 and then tell me which
ones you like and then I'll know what

807
00:44:01,611 --> 00:44:04,730
kinds of I'll be, you're like genius
playlist or another. Oh Wow. That's cool.

808
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:08,370
And then you're using Kat von d
for use genius playlist. I love,

809
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:11,510
she's got some great shit.
Yeah. I'm going to tell you my,

810
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:15,770
my Kat von d music story. Most people,
well, most people don't know that.

811
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,900
She has an amazing voice.

812
00:44:18,110 --> 00:44:21,260
She can sing her ass off and she's
really shy about it. She's crazy.

813
00:44:21,261 --> 00:44:25,040
Shout about it. We have the true, well
let, let me, let me tell you this.

814
00:44:25,041 --> 00:44:27,980
She doesn't like talking about it. No
doubt about it. I just can't say like,

815
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:30,800
Oh yeah, it is true. We're both
working with the same producer,

816
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:32,340
which is also her best friend.

817
00:44:32,341 --> 00:44:36,300
Danny is producing my stuff and he's
messing with her to musically as well.

818
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:40,280
So I'm at Danny's and we're working
on some stuff and he goes, me and uh,

819
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:44,640
me and Kat and Wes Borland
from [inaudible], he's a
guitar player for West.

820
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:48,460
It goes me and West, you're going
to do a little benefit. So kind of,

821
00:44:48,570 --> 00:44:50,370
he really helped me out.
Like last minute,

822
00:44:50,371 --> 00:44:52,260
I had a last minute
they put together this,

823
00:44:52,261 --> 00:44:53,950
they're putting together
this song lasts minutes,

824
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:56,880
a cover and she's going to perform
at this gay benefit, right? Yeah.

825
00:44:56,881 --> 00:45:01,520
It was for the, for uh, Linda
Perry's, um, evening. We
women. It's like awesome. Yeah.

826
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:04,230
So Dan is telling me and
Danny, he's like, man,

827
00:45:04,231 --> 00:45:07,830
we're trying to put together the songs
because it was like less than 48 hours to

828
00:45:07,831 --> 00:45:10,860
learn the song. It was like that
Bronski beat I Lebron TV and like,

829
00:45:11,270 --> 00:45:15,090
and I mean I ended up just like reading
it from my iPad as I was turning until

830
00:45:15,091 --> 00:45:17,220
we fucked it up.
But it was fun and it was great and stuff.

831
00:45:17,221 --> 00:45:21,900
But then I think I had been recording
that night at Linda's and you were at

832
00:45:21,901 --> 00:45:24,990
Danny's and I was really
excited because I had um,

833
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,830
cause I had like gnarly stage fright
issues like for the last year and stuff,

834
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:33,460
just whatever. And so I finally read
the balls I guess to get over them and,

835
00:45:33,650 --> 00:45:37,260
and so obviously Danny is my best friend
and I'm gonna be working on music.

836
00:45:37,261 --> 00:45:39,840
So I was like, Oh hey, I want
to come over. It was late.
I think it was like what,

837
00:45:39,841 --> 00:45:42,590
like almost midnight or something. Yeah,
me and Danny are working on a set that,

838
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,460
and Linda Perry,
for those who don't know,

839
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:49,590
she was the lead singer for four non
blondes. She produced pinks second album,

840
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:53,310
which went fucking skyrocket.
So Linda Perry is a massive,

841
00:45:54,490 --> 00:45:57,660
like Christina Aguilera to the big APP.
You're so beautiful.

842
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,610
She did all the first
thing I want to hear this

843
00:46:02,830 --> 00:46:03,663
Linda Paris,

844
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:10,780
right, right. Yeah. So
she's working with cat now.

845
00:46:10,781 --> 00:46:13,510
They're writing some shit together.
I'm at Danny's, she's all excited.

846
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:17,100
Quarter a song. They brought it over
and then Dan, he's like, text me.

847
00:46:17,101 --> 00:46:20,090
Is it cool if Eddie Bravo is, I'm
like, yeah, I don't care. I've just,

848
00:46:20,091 --> 00:46:21,540
just don't say anything about it.
And then,

849
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:24,030
but of course I had to be in
the other room cause I was like,

850
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:25,410
I'm not going to sit there and go,
oh,

851
00:46:25,411 --> 00:46:27,410
you know how and where do you
think or whatever. But yeah,

852
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:29,370
she had to go to the next room.
It's just like vocal.

853
00:46:29,371 --> 00:46:33,510
There wasn't like a produce
track or anything. And then,
um, Danny was all stoked,

854
00:46:33,511 --> 00:46:37,230
but he, he texts me, he's
like, man, he's still talking
about it. He liked, loved it.

855
00:46:37,231 --> 00:46:39,850
Then I'm like, aw, that makes me,
has that. Danny said, yeah. So what,

856
00:46:39,851 --> 00:46:41,400
what ended up have you and told the story.

857
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:44,100
I've told this story a bunch
cause like the next day at school

858
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:49,380
do you can't tell you. Most
of you guys don't know this,

859
00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:53,430
but I was so impressed with
her voice and the actual song,

860
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:58,200
her and Linda Perry together. I feel with
the right marketing. Of course it could.

861
00:46:58,230 --> 00:46:59,580
It could. It could. It could.

862
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:02,600
I think it could be huge. Could it
be bigger than Paris Hilton? Single.

863
00:47:03,710 --> 00:47:05,660
I like that song a lot.
I bet you did.

864
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:09,410
Did she get that shit tattooed on your
Dick and I will. Anyways, the song,

865
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:11,660
the song they burn,
Linda Perry did together.

866
00:47:11,661 --> 00:47:14,480
The first one that she bought
over is amazing. What's it called?

867
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,330
I'm talking about it yet. It's too, it's,

868
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:20,290
you can't talk about it so she's
just trying to send you hit.

869
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:26,060
The bottom line is she's actually a
great singer. Her voice is amazing.

870
00:47:26,061 --> 00:47:29,320
When I see your artwork, I think you'd
be good at anything you wanted to be.

871
00:47:29,321 --> 00:47:30,080
You'd be amazing

872
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,740
at you if you can.
If you can draw that well,

873
00:47:32,890 --> 00:47:36,130
I mean that's like some really high level
shit. You could do that with anything.

874
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:37,120
I really believe that.

875
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:40,240
I believe that with anybody
who's super awesome and anything.

876
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:43,900
How many bad tattoos do you see a day of
people just coming in with? Like, I mean,

877
00:47:43,901 --> 00:47:45,730
do you, have you, have you ever
seen one that you're just like, wow,

878
00:47:45,731 --> 00:47:47,490
that's the worst tattoo I've ever,

879
00:47:47,530 --> 00:47:50,550
well, I mean it's a, there's such
a big difference in like, um,

880
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:55,200
like personal preference versus
technical aspect of things. So like,

881
00:47:55,530 --> 00:47:58,740
I mean, there's some stuff that's
not necessarily technically it's a,

882
00:47:58,741 --> 00:47:59,880
it's like everything else,
like music,

883
00:47:59,881 --> 00:48:01,530
it's like technically might
not be the best singer,

884
00:48:01,531 --> 00:48:05,040
but the Christmas behind it and, you
know, blah, blah, blah. I mean, well,

885
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:09,180
there's that style that, um, the, the,
the what, what was the teacher Ed Hardy,

886
00:48:09,330 --> 00:48:12,870
that Ed hardy sort of style
fit 1950s traditional stuff,

887
00:48:13,330 --> 00:48:17,690
which not that artistic, but that's all it
is. A Sky like that loner art, you know,

888
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:19,350
and I didn't understand
it for a long time.

889
00:48:19,770 --> 00:48:23,100
My ex husband was like really into doing
that kind of artwork and he's really

890
00:48:23,101 --> 00:48:25,650
great at it. There's an
art behind the, you know,

891
00:48:25,651 --> 00:48:30,180
I personally am not inclined to
do that kind of stuff, but I,

892
00:48:30,181 --> 00:48:32,160
but I appreciate it for what it is.
So I don't know what I mean.

893
00:48:32,430 --> 00:48:36,720
I think I see a lot of great
ideas, you know, and people often,

894
00:48:36,721 --> 00:48:40,820
and then you just see kind of
a poor execution or, or, uh,

895
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:45,390
an inexperienced execution as it.
But yeah, I mean, I don't know.

896
00:48:45,391 --> 00:48:49,260
I'd see so many amazing things now that
like, blow me out of the water. It's like,

897
00:48:49,261 --> 00:48:51,210
fuck, there's so many
great artists nowadays. So

898
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:54,770
I'm permanently scarred from ever getting
a tattoo again because of my tattoo.

899
00:48:54,771 --> 00:48:58,160
Because it was a free tattoo. Was
somebody practicing for their first time?

900
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:01,370
It took seven hours. You should
have take one hour. God, I remember.

901
00:49:01,371 --> 00:49:04,790
I used to be that slow too. Yeah. And then
I found out it's not even supposed to,

902
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:07,760
it's like supposed to be an r for my
last name and I found out it means

903
00:49:07,761 --> 00:49:08,800
waterfalls and now,

904
00:49:08,810 --> 00:49:11,450
so now it's like the ugliest tattoo
ever with this Chinese letter.

905
00:49:11,451 --> 00:49:14,660
That means waterfalls, but it's
probably smiling. Covered up easy. Yeah.

906
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:17,050
That's great. Yeah. You just
get the shit lasered off son.

907
00:49:17,110 --> 00:49:20,890
They could do that pretty easy now.
Especially like um, like it's not red.

908
00:49:20,891 --> 00:49:22,530
Red is apparently the most difficult.
Coke Cola.

909
00:49:22,550 --> 00:49:25,960
Yeah, it's got red. It's got
red in it. Have you got oh is
it? Yeah, it does it. Yeah.

910
00:49:25,961 --> 00:49:28,900
They could work that right.
Easiest to count flu.

911
00:49:29,890 --> 00:49:30,970
I thought that was blue for some reason.

912
00:49:30,971 --> 00:49:32,560
It's written with the red is
the easiest to get out. Yeah,

913
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,990
red and black and then purples and greens.

914
00:49:34,991 --> 00:49:39,991
I think Greens are a little harder but
it all depends on like how have you done

915
00:49:40,091 --> 00:49:42,580
it yet? Have you done the
lasering off anything? Yeah,

916
00:49:42,581 --> 00:49:45,070
these are a couple of like
this whole arm lasered.

917
00:49:45,071 --> 00:49:49,930
It used to be I got this
tattoo and I was like 15 or 16.

918
00:49:49,931 --> 00:49:51,520
It was like the New York dolls,

919
00:49:51,521 --> 00:49:54,470
like cowgirl with a gun and then
there's like a flag coming out of his,

920
00:49:54,471 --> 00:49:56,650
his bang and at the time I thought
it was cool. I'm like, man,

921
00:49:56,651 --> 00:50:01,180
I have the Word Bang on my arm. Get rid
of it. That's better than waterfall.

922
00:50:01,181 --> 00:50:05,230
How long did it take? Well with like
laser, you have to go for sessions.

923
00:50:05,231 --> 00:50:09,520
It's like super painful and
stuff, but more painful than
tattooing. Fuck yeah. Wow.

924
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:13,470
Well I'm a woosie so I dunno, I can't
handle it. Did you just, yeah. Yeah.

925
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:17,410
You have tattoos all over your body and
you're telling me that you're woman ask

926
00:50:17,411 --> 00:50:20,350
anybody at my short like 15 minutes,
then I tap out like candy.

927
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:22,690
Those are all 15 minutes
after. No, this was all,

928
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:26,100
a lot of them was under the
influence of alcohol. So easier.

929
00:50:26,110 --> 00:50:27,890
But now that like back the day

930
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:29,630
does a Taser easier?

931
00:50:31,010 --> 00:50:33,650
Remember that one time where I
drank too much or do I remember

932
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:37,130
you saying that?

933
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:41,690
It's hilarious cause I can just go
through a Rolodex in my head of any moment

934
00:50:41,691 --> 00:50:43,600
that sentence could apply to I,

935
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:49,120
he wrote a blog about my
alcohol problem. No, no,

936
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:50,600
I don't have an alcohol.
I'm not an alcoholic,

937
00:50:50,601 --> 00:50:55,490
but I will drink a lot on special
occasions and when I pass a certain point,

938
00:50:55,491 --> 00:50:59,450
the Indian comes out as Joey Dia says.
And when the Indian comes out, for sure,

939
00:50:59,451 --> 00:51:04,190
I'm not going to remember
any of the night. He's he
blacks out. It's like, oh no.

940
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:09,020
There's like, Ooh, I love you man.
He's a great, he's a great guy.

941
00:51:09,050 --> 00:51:13,580
The problem is he completely checks out
and he doesn't know where he is and he's,

942
00:51:13,630 --> 00:51:18,630
I mean literally is like a third of a
mind controlled by like a demon from

943
00:51:19,461 --> 00:51:23,930
another galaxy.
One Third Eddie and two thirds,

944
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:28,940
some a demonic alcohol sucking demon
from another planet, but weird.

945
00:51:28,970 --> 00:51:33,050
But you can always like, oh no, no, never
even, I don't mean that. I mean demonic.

946
00:51:33,370 --> 00:51:38,270
I mean like possessed by the alcohol,
just wandering around it.

947
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:41,030
He doesn't know what happens until the
next day when he sobers up and you have

948
00:51:41,031 --> 00:51:42,890
to tell them what happens.
Like I, I can't, I,

949
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:47,980
I've had to like get his hotel door
opened by security banging door in Germany

950
00:51:49,101 --> 00:51:52,850
when we were supposed to leave bang on
his door. Finally the door opens. Okay,

951
00:51:52,851 --> 00:51:53,601
we get the door open.

952
00:51:53,601 --> 00:51:58,480
Eddie is lying in bed with
his cowboy boots on and the
light is on and the smile,

953
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:00,890
the light is on.
It's completely,

954
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:04,330
I just completely out cold Eddie.

955
00:52:04,430 --> 00:52:07,580
We got to go to the fucking
airport. He's like, what's up?

956
00:52:08,030 --> 00:52:10,790
He just looks at me and the security.
I was, hey, what's up? Yeah.

957
00:52:10,791 --> 00:52:15,510
Like I'm trying to find it out.
It was the worst story.

958
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:19,130
That's not even the worst story.
The car one car one is the worst.

959
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:22,160
I talked to him,
it was like I was having breakfast,

960
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:25,340
it was like seven o'clock in the morning
and the car was going to come at nine

961
00:52:25,490 --> 00:52:28,910
and he calls me while we were having
breakfast. He still fucked up. I mean,

962
00:52:28,911 --> 00:52:30,330
he is fucked up,

963
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:34,820
was to drink all night and walk onto
the airplane and then sleep all the way

964
00:52:34,821 --> 00:52:39,740
back to like stay up all
night. So, so, uh, you know,

965
00:52:39,741 --> 00:52:43,670
I go, uh, are you fucked up? Did you
stay up on, I said, yeah, fuck yeah man,

966
00:52:43,671 --> 00:52:46,730
I'm a power through. I will
power through. And so I go, okay,

967
00:52:46,731 --> 00:52:48,490
well we're leaving at eight
30. All right, you gotta,

968
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:51,110
you gotta be down there for the car at
eight 30. No, no problem. No problem.

969
00:52:51,111 --> 00:52:55,260
So I eat breakfast. An hour
and a half later I go out
for, you know, wait for him.

970
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:59,600
I don't want him, you know, I want to have
sitting here 10 minutes later I'm like,

971
00:52:59,601 --> 00:53:03,140
okay, what the fuck is going
on? So I talked to the guy
was the valet. I go, Hey,

972
00:53:03,390 --> 00:53:08,150
is my car here? And the guy says, what's
your name? I should Rogan. He goes, oh,

973
00:53:08,151 --> 00:53:12,650
Rogan already left. I go, no,
no, no. Rogan is me. He goes,
no Rogan already left. I go,

974
00:53:12,710 --> 00:53:14,990
what did he look like? Yeah. He said,
well, he had long hair at the time,

975
00:53:14,991 --> 00:53:18,080
so long hair, tattoos. I'm
like, that motherfucker.

976
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:22,230
So I called him up and first of all,
he answers the phone that just hangs up.

977
00:53:22,231 --> 00:53:25,970
It's like, realize this car and
then then the phone, Wah, Wah.

978
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:30,480
I didn't even know what he did. Wake up
and I see you. It's Joe calling. I'm like,

979
00:53:30,810 --> 00:53:32,190
what? I go, what's up? He goes,

980
00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:37,250
you took my car and I hung up and I were
on the Autobahn and I tell the drag of,

981
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:41,700
where are we going? Let's we'll go
to the airport. I'm like, Oh shit.

982
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:45,090
Then he keeps calling him that. That was
the autobon. I don't know what it was,

983
00:53:45,091 --> 00:53:49,410
but we're flying us a regular, Huh?
Well, it sounds like a good time. Yeah.

984
00:53:49,411 --> 00:53:52,490
It was handed to us. Yes. So
then I woke up and I kept cards,

985
00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:57,210
sending it to my message,
a am I answering service or whatever,

986
00:53:57,510 --> 00:54:00,990
and I had to figure out what the hell was
going on. And then I finally answered.

987
00:54:00,991 --> 00:54:04,470
He's so fucking mad. I'm like, Holy Shit.
I'm sorry. I have no idea what happened.

988
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:07,080
I just woke up in the back of the car.
I don't remember the whole night.

989
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:10,800
I must have passed and just just jumped
in, jumped in his car. This was like,

990
00:54:10,890 --> 00:54:13,290
it's like total,
like if Eddie,

991
00:54:13,291 --> 00:54:16,830
there's a certain number of drinks where
he gets over will just disappear and

992
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:19,960
he's gone. The, the Aubrey
story, the Texas was,

993
00:54:22,350 --> 00:54:25,300
I brought that up. I wasn't, I was
just going to bring up the end.

994
00:54:26,670 --> 00:54:29,760
He would also have to know,
you know what else I found out?

995
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:32,260
I found out my cat in
Japanese means waterfalls,

996
00:54:32,261 --> 00:54:34,990
and then I'm like thinking
something's fucked up with waterfall.

997
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:40,900
Hecky in Japanese means waterfalls.
I found out the other day then you should,

998
00:54:40,910 --> 00:54:42,340
you should be celebrating your tattoo.

999
00:54:42,341 --> 00:54:45,400
I didn't want to go chasing waterfalls
this mind for some no. Need to know why.

1000
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:50,290
What's that song from? What was that?
Bam, Tlc. TLC. There was a sweet song.

1001
00:54:50,350 --> 00:54:54,820
I'm never going to walk in the ocean
cause I might come out of Blob. Brian,

1002
00:54:54,821 --> 00:54:58,420
you need to go outside and get some air.
So what are your plans for your music?

1003
00:54:58,630 --> 00:55:01,470
What's the plan? Well, you know, I've it,

1004
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:04,410
the coolest thing I think with Linda
is like, we're just kind of, we're,

1005
00:55:04,411 --> 00:55:08,580
we're moving forward without any,
uh,

1006
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:13,180
deadlines. No, it was on the deadlines.
We have goals obviously, but it's a,

1007
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:16,710
you know, like by summertime I think it
should be done out, which is exciting.

1008
00:55:16,711 --> 00:55:21,060
But I think it's like we
not really congesting our
thoughts with anything right

1009
00:55:21,061 --> 00:55:25,590
now. We're just writing music
without outside voices. No
reference. Just, you know.

1010
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:27,370
So you said you got
over your stage fright,

1011
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:30,090
you're going to start doing live
performances. Oh, Yay. Yeah. Yeah.

1012
00:55:30,091 --> 00:55:34,020
I'm putting a band together. Yeah. Yeah.
You're going to go on tour? Yeah. Yeah.

1013
00:55:34,021 --> 00:55:37,560
Holy Shit. Wow. She's going to be a rock
star watch. You're going to be a rockstar.

1014
00:55:38,910 --> 00:55:40,290
The term is so weird to me.

1015
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:44,740
It seems like you can sneak it through
from the back door just from just from

1016
00:55:44,830 --> 00:55:49,150
having talent and being on TV.
It's like you just went through.

1017
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:49,970
I Dunno.
I just,

1018
00:55:49,970 --> 00:55:53,180
I want to do everything with even
small things with a lot of quality.

1019
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:57,340
And so I think like with the music stuff,
I just want to make it as, you know, uh,

1020
00:55:57,590 --> 00:56:01,970
as good as possible for lack of a
better description. But, um, yeah,

1021
00:56:01,971 --> 00:56:04,910
so I think people will probably be
pleasantly surprised in the sense that

1022
00:56:05,090 --> 00:56:07,850
they're expecting me to fail
as usual. So, yeah, I like it.

1023
00:56:07,851 --> 00:56:10,940
People are expecting you to fail. I think
people always expect you to feel like,

1024
00:56:10,941 --> 00:56:13,640
you know, I think grilling. Yeah. I
mean other than your friends, Avi,

1025
00:56:13,650 --> 00:56:17,510
I'm talking about like,
you know, yeah, I think so.
Especially me. Cause I was on TV,

1026
00:56:17,511 --> 00:56:20,450
so it's like, oh, you're just
doing the, that's definitely true.

1027
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:22,580
But you have some success.
They want it to be at.

1028
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:24,010
It's hard to get into music after you

1029
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:27,570
already famous with for something
else. It's tough. Yeah. So, oh, hello.

1030
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:30,430
Has Anybody ever done it?
Well, Jamie Foxx, Steve Martin,

1031
00:56:30,431 --> 00:56:32,890
sort of Steve Martin is bands pretty,

1032
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:38,440
pretty big for a certain kind of music.
Oh, he does like just playing music shows,

1033
00:56:38,441 --> 00:56:42,280
right? Yeah. Yeah, he does.
He plays the Banjo and stuff.
A bunch of like, you know,

1034
00:56:42,281 --> 00:56:45,240
it's a certain style of music, but he's
doing six. He's successful in that,

1035
00:56:45,370 --> 00:56:48,700
you know. Hmm. Anybody Audie
Murphy. Oh, that's right.

1036
00:56:51,590 --> 00:56:54,280
And that's kind of like
what my stuff sounds like.

1037
00:56:56,950 --> 00:57:00,080
What kind of shit to you sound like?
What does it,

1038
00:57:00,310 --> 00:57:04,040
Linda and I both have like tried figuring
it out and the dark Sarah McLaughlin

1039
00:57:04,041 --> 00:57:06,250
kind of stopped it.
Don't say that kind of stuff.

1040
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:10,900
I could never compare myself to
anybody, but uh, yeah, no, it's just,

1041
00:57:10,970 --> 00:57:15,270
she just calls it, uh, uh,
powerfully put that x, which is,

1042
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:17,740
which is good power,
powerfully put that egg.

1043
00:57:17,741 --> 00:57:20,860
I think it's tragic and romantic,

1044
00:57:20,861 --> 00:57:24,310
but there's like elements of classical
music and and stuff and some electronic

1045
00:57:24,311 --> 00:57:27,700
element. There won't be any show cro
type. All I want to do is have some fun.

1046
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:30,730
You don't know that song.

1047
00:57:34,230 --> 00:57:39,230
[inaudible] stuff and listen,

1048
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:43,510
we're so mainly we take in the other
direction. We're not scared to talk.

1049
00:57:43,511 --> 00:57:46,900
Sheryl crow. That's a great
song. It's a great fucking song.

1050
00:57:47,050 --> 00:57:50,130
You don't like that kind of
music? I just don't, I don't know.

1051
00:57:50,131 --> 00:57:53,860
What do you listen to personally?
Oh Man. Kent, Kent, Kansas.

1052
00:57:53,861 --> 00:57:56,230
One of my favorite bands was a Swedish
tea. I like a lot of Scandinavian music.

1053
00:57:56,231 --> 00:57:59,390
I like a lot of metal and I like a
lot of love, Depeche mode in the cure,

1054
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:03,400
shit like that. So a lot of obscure
shit that people wouldn't be aware of.

1055
00:58:03,401 --> 00:58:06,290
And then a lot of like classic
shit like Susie and the banshees.

1056
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:12,010
I don't even listen to anything that's
made before 1980 anymore of giving black

1057
00:58:12,011 --> 00:58:15,910
sabbath black. I listened, I
listened to some black keys.

1058
00:58:16,030 --> 00:58:17,550
That's the only modern
shit I'll listen to.

1059
00:58:17,770 --> 00:58:19,510
And then everything else is old stuff.
I've been listening.

1060
00:58:19,511 --> 00:58:24,430
He's like Allman brothers. Oh,
okay. I see what you're saying.

1061
00:58:25,970 --> 00:58:29,380
I said before, sorry, anything
after 1980 I'm like done. I'm done.

1062
00:58:29,410 --> 00:58:30,340
Except the black keys.

1063
00:58:30,370 --> 00:58:33,910
The black keys seem to have kept the
soul like honey and honey, honey. Yeah,

1064
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:38,020
that's right there. My
friends. Oh yeah, sure.

1065
00:58:38,021 --> 00:58:41,050
I go to some of the best shit ever.

1066
00:58:41,290 --> 00:58:45,040
But I mean like modern bands that like
you hear on the radio that are like big

1067
00:58:45,041 --> 00:58:49,570
hits. Like I can't get into, I
couldn't even tell you supermarket.

1068
00:58:49,571 --> 00:58:51,400
Every now and then,
that's the only time I hear music.

1069
00:58:51,430 --> 00:58:55,060
I'm just shopping and I'm like, what
the fuck is this? Is this something new?

1070
00:58:55,570 --> 00:58:56,790
Just some weird,
no,

1071
00:58:57,240 --> 00:59:01,510
it would be some weird
fucking auto tuned bullshit.

1072
00:59:01,511 --> 00:59:05,260
And it's repeating itself over and over
again. And I'm like, is this the new shit?

1073
00:59:05,261 --> 00:59:07,450
Is this, is this like, is
this popular right now?

1074
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:11,230
I feel like I'm some dude who's like an
outlier like comes into town every now

1075
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:14,350
and then to find out what the folks
are up to. That's what it feels like.

1076
00:59:14,550 --> 00:59:16,780
And as I get older and older,
it becomes more and more apparent.

1077
00:59:16,781 --> 00:59:20,650
I can understand like especially like,
I mean I like some like pop music I guess,

1078
00:59:20,651 --> 00:59:22,150
but I, it's, it's,

1079
00:59:22,170 --> 00:59:24,140
it's hard for me to wrap my
mind around certain things.

1080
00:59:24,141 --> 00:59:26,390
Like how does that resonate with
people? Because for me, I'm always,

1081
00:59:26,391 --> 00:59:30,500
I love poetry and I love things that
are so much more profound and uh,

1082
00:59:30,530 --> 00:59:32,780
and I think people are hungry
for that. You know? I think like,

1083
00:59:33,110 --> 00:59:36,770
even though like a lot of stuff that's
like really big right now is very

1084
00:59:36,771 --> 00:59:41,500
superficial and whatever. But like I
feel like there's definitely like, um,

1085
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:45,740
I think people are hurting and they
want to relate somehow. So I don't know.

1086
00:59:46,510 --> 00:59:49,000
Well, I, yeah, I definitely think that,

1087
00:59:49,001 --> 00:59:50,940
but I also think there's
like a lot of music to it.

1088
00:59:50,941 --> 00:59:53,140
Some people just aren't even aware of.
Of course,

1089
00:59:53,170 --> 00:59:56,230
there's a lot of young kids today that
don't even know what a whole lot of love

1090
00:59:56,231 --> 00:59:59,640
sounds like when you hear it through
like really good speakers. Yeah. But the,

1091
00:59:59,641 --> 01:00:00,440
the day man

1092
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:04,700
driving down a Hollywood and I seen these
awesome fucking metal heads and they

1093
01:00:04,701 --> 01:00:06,380
were like,
Karen skateboards is like young kids.

1094
01:00:06,710 --> 01:00:09,920
And they had like one at like a death
shirt on and then we had like a motor head

1095
01:00:09,921 --> 01:00:10,880
shirt on and I was just like,

1096
01:00:11,230 --> 01:00:14,570
they literally rolled my window down and
my friend Allison was and I'm like, Hey,

1097
01:00:14,571 --> 01:00:18,050
I love you guys. And they
were like, I love you too.

1098
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:20,630
Fucking long hair

1099
01:00:20,710 --> 01:00:22,880
does metal will never die. So cool. Yeah.

1100
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:27,010
I thought metal was gone in the 80s I
thought I should do like obscure black

1101
01:00:27,011 --> 01:00:27,390
metal

1102
01:00:27,390 --> 01:00:29,550
stuff that's like, you know
it's, I dunno, it's cool.

1103
01:00:29,820 --> 01:00:31,670
It'll will never die.
It won't.

1104
01:00:31,671 --> 01:00:34,370
That feeling will never die
because there's always going
to be shitty parenting.

1105
01:00:35,390 --> 01:00:38,720
You're never going to get rid of metal
because you're never going to make people

1106
01:00:38,721 --> 01:00:43,070
become good parents. You're always
going to have people just up. Fuck yeah,

1107
01:00:47,090 --> 01:00:49,000
they just want to pound on the wall,

1108
01:00:49,070 --> 01:00:53,930
fucking scream and curse
their circumstances and turn
cross is upside down. Yeah.

1109
01:00:53,931 --> 01:00:55,250
You're always going to
have shitty parenting,

1110
01:00:55,251 --> 01:00:57,140
so you're always gonna have back it.
All that shit.

1111
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:01,940
I bet that shit is on a computer. I
wrote Satanic lyrics like every song had.

1112
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:07,620
It either had to be about when I was
in 14 1516 all the songs I wrote were

1113
01:01:08,030 --> 01:01:12,000
nuclear war,
anti religion,

1114
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:16,930
abs, demons, killing priests, love
songs. Nothing about Lo. No, no,

1115
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:21,470
not until like I was 19 or it's in
your defense though, when we were kids,

1116
01:01:21,471 --> 01:01:23,870
we were growing up. You
know, we're older than you.

1117
01:01:23,871 --> 01:01:27,050
Probably don't recognize that
Soviet Union threat feeling.

1118
01:01:27,230 --> 01:01:30,560
Did you ever have that threat when you
were a kid? Did you ever feel that? See,

1119
01:01:30,561 --> 01:01:32,270
when we,
when Eddie and I grew up,

1120
01:01:32,330 --> 01:01:35,840
we were really worried that we're going
to get an a nuclear war with the Soviet

1121
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:37,910
Union. Everybody, oh yeah, Brad, bro,

1122
01:01:37,911 --> 01:01:42,110
everybody did so close.
So close.

1123
01:01:42,111 --> 01:01:47,000
Dinosaurs roamed the earth. How
dare you look. It's possible today.

1124
01:01:47,030 --> 01:01:49,670
But back then it was,
it was not just possible.

1125
01:01:49,671 --> 01:01:54,170
It seemed probable seventies late
seventies late seventies early eighties

1126
01:01:54,171 --> 01:01:56,120
everybody thought we were
going to war with Russia.

1127
01:01:56,270 --> 01:02:00,290
That was a fact until Ronald
Reagan and Chernobyl affected,

1128
01:02:00,380 --> 01:02:02,210
effectively bankrupted the Soviet Union.

1129
01:02:02,211 --> 01:02:04,490
That's one of the big
things that brought it down.

1130
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:06,500
But when the Soviet Union fell apart,

1131
01:02:06,970 --> 01:02:09,920
then everybody took a deep breath
and relax. But until that happened,

1132
01:02:09,950 --> 01:02:13,470
there was always this constant thread
that they were going to take a solo war

1133
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:16,040
three were going to go. Yeah, they
were great. They were in Cuba.

1134
01:02:16,070 --> 01:02:19,220
I mean they were 90 miles from our
border setting up missile silos.

1135
01:02:19,230 --> 01:02:20,160
I mean there was a lot

1136
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:22,290
of shit that went down during
the Kennedy administration,

1137
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:26,820
so there was that feeling as,
especially as technology increased,

1138
01:02:26,970 --> 01:02:30,480
and then there was that star wars program
that came on when they were developing

1139
01:02:30,481 --> 01:02:33,000
these fucking things to shoot
missiles out of the sky.

1140
01:02:33,150 --> 01:02:36,980
They'd be like satellites
that were launched up with
lasers to zap missiles at a

1141
01:02:36,990 --> 01:02:37,191
sky.

1142
01:02:37,191 --> 01:02:41,000
That's like a significant part of the
budget and significant part of like what

1143
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:43,920
Ronald Reagan was talking about when
they were talking about national defense.

1144
01:02:44,070 --> 01:02:47,490
So we were worried about going to war
with Russia. It was constant work, kids,

1145
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:50,190
very popular song topic.
It seems fucked up, right?

1146
01:02:50,540 --> 01:02:54,450
It doesn't even make sense to you. It
was a band called nuclear assault is bad.

1147
01:02:54,510 --> 01:02:58,910
The song's called nuclear death, nuclear
death. Just nuclear Dick Suck. Yeah.

1148
01:02:59,340 --> 01:03:01,380
Nuclear Wild. Oh, there's a crazy,

1149
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:04,920
I'll have new holocaust off
to put it up later. Did you,

1150
01:03:04,921 --> 01:03:08,950
have you seen that video Brian, that the
Holocaust survivor or excuse me, the um,

1151
01:03:09,290 --> 01:03:13,830
uh, the Hiroshima survivor
made, he made a, a cartoon.

1152
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:17,430
You got to pull it up. Um, I forget
the guy's name something. Ben,

1153
01:03:17,470 --> 01:03:20,100
is he going to put it
sad? Oh, it's crazy. Well,

1154
01:03:20,101 --> 01:03:25,101
it's a cartoon that was written by a
survivor from Hiroshima and it depicting

1155
01:03:27,211 --> 01:03:30,420
how it was like, what the experience
was like for the people on the ground.

1156
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:34,380
It's fucked up man.
Cause even though it's just a cartoon,

1157
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:37,830
I mean just to watch it when, uh, after
the, he can't handle it, you know,

1158
01:03:37,831 --> 01:03:38,730
when to wash in front of us.

1159
01:03:39,030 --> 01:03:43,590
The less I know better about really
bad sometimes I dunno, I'll get sad.

1160
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:45,161
It's kind of crazy.

1161
01:03:45,161 --> 01:03:48,900
And there's like 10 different countries
or more that has nuclear weapons. I mean,

1162
01:03:48,901 --> 01:03:52,950
how many have them? Seven? I don't know.
You just taking guesses over there. So,

1163
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:56,980
yeah, I mean, and then we know Pakistan,
India, the UK, certainly, you know,

1164
01:03:56,981 --> 01:04:01,890
in the Korean War,
we don't think 18 Korean cities disappear.

1165
01:04:02,310 --> 01:04:06,030
We did 18 that's why they fucking
hate us, man. They're like, no more,

1166
01:04:06,180 --> 01:04:09,440
no more of this bullshit. They just shut
the shut themselves off from the world.

1167
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:13,560
Can you imagine that 18 cities
disappear and it was no nuclear.

1168
01:04:13,561 --> 01:04:17,160
It was all like what? Hydrogen bombs
and Shannon, I dunno the bombs they is,

1169
01:04:17,161 --> 01:04:21,090
but they made 18 they leveled 18
cities in Korea during the Korean War.

1170
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:25,530
She's crying. Shit, we don't, they
don't talk about that too much. Yeah.

1171
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:26,610
Wrap your head around that.

1172
01:04:26,670 --> 01:04:31,070
Try thinking about 18 American
cities just disappearing. Yeah. Yeah.

1173
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:33,240
It's the whole game
changed when you can fly,

1174
01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:37,080
when you can fly and shoot shit from
the sky. That's the game changer.

1175
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:39,510
And it all happened all at once.
Fly,

1176
01:04:39,570 --> 01:04:43,140
shoot things from the sky and then
almost right after that nuclear bombs,

1177
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:46,530
it's pretty nutty when you think about
that because there was no fucking airport

1178
01:04:47,490 --> 01:04:51,100
or airplane wars just a
hundred years ago in the,

1179
01:04:51,110 --> 01:04:53,010
in the early 19 hundreds were there.

1180
01:04:53,011 --> 01:04:55,830
They weren't fucking flying everywhere
and dropping bombs on each other.

1181
01:04:55,970 --> 01:04:59,490
They started doing that in the 30s and
the forties that's when like they started

1182
01:04:59,491 --> 01:05:03,960
getting better at rocketry and then boom,
47 nuclear bomb, complete game changer.

1183
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:08,160
The whole thing takes less than a
hundred years to go from the airplane.

1184
01:05:08,161 --> 01:05:12,960
Being fucking invented to dropping nuclear
bombs on people is a hundred years.

1185
01:05:13,050 --> 01:05:17,830
That's nuts. Have you ever tatted a
nuclear missile? I even thought of that.

1186
01:05:17,940 --> 01:05:18,260
Yeah,

1187
01:05:18,260 --> 01:05:21,340
I think I have. I've really never
even thought of that until just now.

1188
01:05:21,341 --> 01:05:24,850
That is a crazy number that
the invention of the airplane,

1189
01:05:25,030 --> 01:05:30,030
it goes invention of the airplane all
the way to nuclear bombs and it's in less

1190
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:30,400
than a hundred years.

1191
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:35,400
So essentially one lifetime we go from
people stuck on the ground or in boats to

1192
01:05:35,651 --> 01:05:40,330
someone who could drop a fucking nuclear
bomb on your country. That's amazing.

1193
01:05:41,380 --> 01:05:44,410
What a fucking weird
jump in history that is.

1194
01:05:44,470 --> 01:05:47,470
That might be the biggest jump in
history that's ever been recorded. That,

1195
01:05:47,471 --> 01:05:51,860
and I never even thought
about it. And there's nowhere
to go. Is there? Oh, I mean,

1196
01:05:51,861 --> 01:05:54,400
I went crazy.
We were crazy.

1197
01:05:54,410 --> 01:05:59,000
Knowing where to go and move into Finland,
Finland, a lot of death metal there.

1198
01:06:01,150 --> 01:06:06,130
What do you love about them and it's
easier to go to Alaska probably isn't so

1199
01:06:06,131 --> 01:06:08,830
much cooler.
Alaska is gorgeous though.

1200
01:06:09,050 --> 01:06:12,280
We can make Alaska cool chef to
have more cool people move up there.

1201
01:06:13,330 --> 01:06:16,690
You're friends with the
singer from him, right? Yeah.

1202
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:21,850
It's totally into that mother or that
there. Are they from Finland? Finnish.

1203
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:26,380
They're like a, it's almost like
a satanic love metal band. Right?

1204
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:31,300
How would you describe him? It
means his infernal majesty. Oh Geez.

1205
01:06:31,350 --> 01:06:34,020
Jesus Christ.
Someone needs to hold that Duke down.

1206
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:36,730
[inaudible] I think it
was taken from my gun.

1207
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:41,920
Hold that down and make him take his
pills. He spotted all over my couch.

1208
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:46,260
Poppy metal, like satanic. Love suicide.

1209
01:06:46,830 --> 01:06:50,190
That's crazy. Yeah. Get
them to do hill sprints.

1210
01:06:50,820 --> 01:06:55,140
Maybe a sandbag workout. Be Good. Dig
a hole for today. I want you to be,

1211
01:06:55,650 --> 01:06:56,970
I want you to be happy.
You're alive.

1212
01:06:57,060 --> 01:06:58,980
I want you to dig a hole
and then when you're done,

1213
01:06:58,981 --> 01:07:01,080
when we can give you a cold drink,
I'm going to feel awesome.

1214
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:08,570
That's not bad. Why Finland?
Why would you escape to Finland?

1215
01:07:09,050 --> 01:07:12,590
Finland, Ace, go there once a year.
If the shit hit the fan in America.

1216
01:07:12,591 --> 01:07:13,424
Is that what you would do?

1217
01:07:14,310 --> 01:07:18,400
I would say it's like there's
not really anywhere to go really.

1218
01:07:18,401 --> 01:07:20,480
What do you think about it?
I think Canada is and move.

1219
01:07:20,510 --> 01:07:23,180
At least you would find out what the
fuck is going on for a little bit.

1220
01:07:23,181 --> 01:07:27,480
Maybe a couple of years of safety
before you had escape to an article.

1221
01:07:27,490 --> 01:07:30,770
Back to the Siberians. Like do they
even know about it? No. I'm guess what?

1222
01:07:30,771 --> 01:07:34,700
They're just happy. They are happy,
but you wouldn't be happy doing it.

1223
01:07:34,710 --> 01:07:37,850
You mean you say you might be adaptive,
but man, you would remember the internet,

1224
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,530
you'd remember driving
around your bad ass.

1225
01:07:39,540 --> 01:07:42,890
Carla's favorite songs on
my book tour last year,

1226
01:07:42,950 --> 01:07:47,690
halfway through my house burned
down and demolished. You know,

1227
01:07:47,691 --> 01:07:51,650
just gone down the street from
Danny and I remember I went,

1228
01:07:51,710 --> 01:07:53,260
I went on the rest of the book tour,
you know,

1229
01:07:53,290 --> 01:07:58,290
it was like a month or two after and went
through Canada and I just didn't tell

1230
01:07:59,601 --> 01:08:02,360
anybody. Just kind of,
you know, hey, I'm here.

1231
01:08:02,361 --> 01:08:04,520
And I literally had like what
I was wearing and that was it.

1232
01:08:04,521 --> 01:08:08,510
And then when I came back, you know, I
had told cat the other cat, my assistant,

1233
01:08:08,570 --> 01:08:11,120
like, I don't really want anything when
I get back, I'm just going to live at,

1234
01:08:11,180 --> 01:08:16,070
I have a gallery next door to my tattoo
shop, it's like an gallery. And we

1235
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:19,700
had like an upstairs area
that was for stock, you know,

1236
01:08:19,701 --> 01:08:23,090
and like probably the size of your
bathroom or something. And like she,

1237
01:08:23,540 --> 01:08:26,360
she went and got like a air mattress
from target, which I was like, oh no,

1238
01:08:26,361 --> 01:08:29,300
it's too much. It's too much, you
know? But it was so weird having to,

1239
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:31,910
or it's too much. Yeah. It just, it was,

1240
01:08:31,911 --> 01:08:34,160
it was easier to just being as
simple as possible, you know?

1241
01:08:34,161 --> 01:08:37,850
And you don't even want to
air mattress, you're going,
oh, sure. Got It. So I got it.

1242
01:08:37,851 --> 01:08:42,490
So then I, I slept on an air mattress
and uh, yeah, it was, it was fun.

1243
01:08:42,530 --> 01:08:46,760
It was just like an exercise for
you, like letting things go and, no,

1244
01:08:46,761 --> 01:08:47,330
I mean I didn't,

1245
01:08:47,330 --> 01:08:51,050
I never struggled with it like the
from the minute I got the news, but um,

1246
01:08:51,190 --> 01:08:52,760
but I mean I was in a clear place

1247
01:08:52,910 --> 01:08:55,730
even when I say exercise,
I don't mean necessarily like a strain,

1248
01:08:55,731 --> 01:09:00,490
but like a direct path that you chose
to take a direct path of a minimum

1249
01:09:00,630 --> 01:09:01,450
minimalist.
Yeah.

1250
01:09:01,450 --> 01:09:05,840
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And let me
know. I've done it like in other ways too.

1251
01:09:05,841 --> 01:09:10,310
It's not a matter of depriving myself of
punishing myself, you know, like, right.

1252
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:13,300
I was like celibate for
a year. Like, oh Geez.

1253
01:09:14,980 --> 01:09:17,830
Oh my God. I'm glad for that.

1254
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:21,460
I'm just saying it's
like being as he leaves,

1255
01:09:21,970 --> 01:09:23,950
he's going to go beat off.
No.

1256
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:26,200
Oh, you don't know him. He's crazy.

1257
01:09:26,201 --> 01:09:29,500
He's quick with it to be back in
before we even need them. Yeah.

1258
01:09:29,501 --> 01:09:30,520
That's ridiculous.

1259
01:09:31,490 --> 01:09:35,440
I love how we had it when I was at the
time they were like, or like on purpose.

1260
01:09:35,441 --> 01:09:35,790
I'm like,

1261
01:09:35,790 --> 01:09:38,580
well, first of all, I think that's
way easier for a woman to do.

1262
01:09:38,581 --> 01:09:43,540
Not just physically but psychologically
cause there's more dickhead dude's a

1263
01:09:43,541 --> 01:09:47,580
dickhead. Dudes are dangerous. Whereas
girls that are paying the assay data,

1264
01:09:47,670 --> 01:09:49,500
they're not,
they're very rarely dangerous.

1265
01:09:49,501 --> 01:09:51,470
It's not like the weird
feeling of intimidation.

1266
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:54,420
Much more emotional and annoying. If
they can get emotional, that's for sure.

1267
01:09:54,421 --> 01:09:58,290
But it's not a, it's not like, like
you, you've been beat up or anything.

1268
01:09:58,291 --> 01:10:01,560
Like I know women who've been hit by
men and then they're done with men for

1269
01:10:01,561 --> 01:10:03,990
years. I mean that, that
makes sense though to me.

1270
01:10:04,290 --> 01:10:06,300
Whereas a guy taking a year off a sec

1271
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:08,220
am I wasn't,
you can't find a nice check.

1272
01:10:08,250 --> 01:10:12,500
It wasn't about being reactive like
to something like, well I got hurt.

1273
01:10:12,870 --> 01:10:16,850
It was just more as making a
conscious decision at the time match.

1274
01:10:16,851 --> 01:10:18,660
If you had just like one
year yeast infection,

1275
01:10:18,661 --> 01:10:21,810
that was our mother wouldn't even go out.

1276
01:10:22,330 --> 01:10:25,690
Daddy's not even pay attention.
I know we've looked everybody we lost.

1277
01:10:25,691 --> 01:10:26,980
We lost you. Totally, man.

1278
01:10:27,460 --> 01:10:32,170
No, but you know, it was just, it's just
like, uh, I dunno. Celibacy bores me.

1279
01:10:32,330 --> 01:10:36,920
Yeah. It just shows like he
just checked out totally.

1280
01:10:37,130 --> 01:10:40,910
He's thinking of his new songs,
working on working on Jujitsu moves,

1281
01:10:41,630 --> 01:10:45,440
naughty show thing. As I've been looking
at that girl's boob this entire, yeah.

1282
01:10:45,630 --> 01:10:48,990
Pretty Nice, right? It's pretty
nice for Monica. I'm a mannequin.

1283
01:10:49,020 --> 01:10:53,160
It's about as hot as it gets.
She's pretty sexy. She's Brian's.

1284
01:10:53,161 --> 01:10:56,680
All this stuff is Brian's. This
has nothing to do with me. I, uh,

1285
01:10:57,150 --> 01:11:00,180
I don't want to be judged by this.
He's a silly guy.

1286
01:11:00,270 --> 01:11:04,680
He's got a lot of weird shit really leave
because I said no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1287
01:11:04,681 --> 01:11:07,830
He just has to probably smoke a cigarette
or something. Oh, he's an odd duck.

1288
01:11:07,831 --> 01:11:11,730
But we make an interesting combination.
It's good. He's just trained fucking dude.

1289
01:11:11,731 --> 01:11:13,170
It's hard finding someone that's strange,

1290
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:16,500
that also is kind of funny
and knows how to run things.

1291
01:11:17,580 --> 01:11:21,000
So we've got a weird little
relationship. Me and that guy. Yeah.

1292
01:11:21,001 --> 01:11:23,160
But going back to the Siberians like that,

1293
01:11:26,310 --> 01:11:30,120
what about nuclear war?
We're going to pass right on with that.

1294
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:33,870
I think I'm just fucking, I think a
barrier. It's like we were saying,

1295
01:11:33,930 --> 01:11:36,360
I think they're only happy because they
don't know about all the groovy shit.

1296
01:11:37,470 --> 01:11:38,530
They don't know about iPhone.

1297
01:11:40,170 --> 01:11:42,540
Iphone five iPhone five is
going to be out in a week.

1298
01:11:42,970 --> 01:11:46,500
They didn't know about that shit. I
never drove. I never drove it. Yeah. See,

1299
01:11:46,501 --> 01:11:47,940
you're all excited.
You're thinking,

1300
01:11:47,941 --> 01:11:52,220
I'm going to get my assistant to go get
me one. You know, fucking Siberian dude's.

1301
01:11:52,230 --> 01:11:54,600
They'd never drove a nice car.
Never listened to a good stereo.

1302
01:11:54,780 --> 01:11:57,970
They're only the only think they're
happy about and they're chasing down beat

1303
01:11:57,990 --> 01:12:01,950
pelts. That shit's ridiculous. I
think it can be way more happy today,

1304
01:12:01,970 --> 01:12:06,870
like in a way higher peaky or sort of a
way, but there's a lot of crashes today.

1305
01:12:07,050 --> 01:12:08,850
There's a lot of,
what does it all mean?

1306
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:13,350
But then there's like the most awesome
time because we're not ready for that yet.

1307
01:12:13,580 --> 01:12:17,940
It's too much work. Well, it's an amazing
amount of work. The whole species,

1308
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:21,510
it's that and they're also busy.
You know,

1309
01:12:21,540 --> 01:12:24,930
people have to feed themselves and pay
their bills and you get caught up in that

1310
01:12:24,931 --> 01:12:29,010
sort of a work cycle where you're doing
something with your time every day just

1311
01:12:29,011 --> 01:12:30,270
in order to stay alive.

1312
01:12:30,540 --> 01:12:33,930
And it's real hard to get on another
path once you're on that path because you

1313
01:12:33,931 --> 01:12:37,380
sort of bad habits, I guess,
right? It's not even bad habits.

1314
01:12:37,381 --> 01:12:38,550
It's almost just necessity.

1315
01:12:38,580 --> 01:12:41,670
If you want to get by in life and
you're a person who you know, you,

1316
01:12:41,671 --> 01:12:44,580
you have a degree and then all of a
sudden you have a job and then all of a

1317
01:12:44,581 --> 01:12:47,490
sudden you have a mortgage and you have
a family or whatever the fuck it is that

1318
01:12:47,491 --> 01:12:52,400
you have. Is it x, Y, or z the beginning,
or is it the full morning Mani?

1319
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:53,880
What?
What do you have that's holding you back?

1320
01:12:54,180 --> 01:12:55,980
But when you get to a certain point,

1321
01:12:55,981 --> 01:12:59,220
when you've accumulated like a mortgage
and accumulated a car lease and

1322
01:12:59,221 --> 01:13:01,860
insurance and all this different shit
that you have to pay for constantly,

1323
01:13:02,190 --> 01:13:06,210
it's very, very hard to break
free and get your shit together.

1324
01:13:06,211 --> 01:13:08,340
It's very hard to do what
you're doing right now.

1325
01:13:08,341 --> 01:13:13,050
You got on the right path from you on
this like hell bent for leather thing.

1326
01:13:13,170 --> 01:13:16,620
Like it's either gonna work or it's not
going to work, but it's pretty good. Boom.

1327
01:13:16,621 --> 01:13:20,460
It just, you just went out there and it
worked. It worked fantastic and amazing.

1328
01:13:20,850 --> 01:13:23,970
But the reality is for a lot of people
when they got on the wrong track and then

1329
01:13:23,971 --> 01:13:27,000
they got to change tracks,
that's when shit gets hard.

1330
01:13:27,001 --> 01:13:30,120
The key is you got to get on
that right track from the get go.

1331
01:13:30,450 --> 01:13:33,280
Like doing repair work
on your life. No, no.

1332
01:13:33,420 --> 01:13:38,280
Back and the track. I think you
think so? I think you can always,

1333
01:13:38,281 --> 01:13:39,600
if you're willing to just go for it.

1334
01:13:39,930 --> 01:13:44,160
Most people are not really financially
able to do that. It's too hard.

1335
01:13:44,550 --> 01:13:46,170
It's too hard.
If you have obligations,

1336
01:13:46,710 --> 01:13:51,660
it'd be hard to live a life that was
dictated by it. I guess financials.

1337
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:56,340
Yeah. Sucks. It's nothing ever gets done
that way, you know, especially creatively.

1338
01:13:56,341 --> 01:14:01,341
That's like the worst possible reason
you could be creating art as like just

1339
01:14:01,561 --> 01:14:03,420
thinking I'm gonna get paid.

1340
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:07,890
Just just make you know all
your illustrations to be
about how much money can I

1341
01:14:07,891 --> 01:14:12,310
make off of this? I wouldn't even work.
No, they've come out clunky and shit.

1342
01:14:12,311 --> 01:14:14,350
And insincere hat.
Yeah,

1343
01:14:14,710 --> 01:14:18,790
like music or bad comic book artists.
Right.

1344
01:14:18,850 --> 01:14:22,990
Why does he laugh? What I'm talking
about? You don't even have your own mind.

1345
01:14:22,991 --> 01:14:24,510
Could I have some comic book artists?
Yeah.

1346
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:26,770
Do you remember when you were a kid and
you'd get comic books and every now and

1347
01:14:26,771 --> 01:14:29,350
then some new idiot was like
drawing the hall, you know,

1348
01:14:29,351 --> 01:14:32,500
like what is this guy doing?
Like the hulk doesn't even look like,

1349
01:14:32,930 --> 01:14:34,380
I thought it was worse when like they,

1350
01:14:34,390 --> 01:14:38,840
they like I remember Spiderman when used
to draw it and it was like really cool.

1351
01:14:38,841 --> 01:14:41,600
And then I guess McFarland one need to
like leave or whatever and do his own

1352
01:14:41,601 --> 01:14:45,860
thing. So they found somebody, they
just copied his own style mcfarlane.

1353
01:14:46,130 --> 01:14:48,600
The spawn guy? Yeah. Who wanted to do

1354
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:52,150
well, we got to get Michael Jai white
in here. Man I got to it. Yeah, I got a,

1355
01:14:52,210 --> 01:14:54,600
I think I have his number, but
let me check it with you. Yeah,

1356
01:14:54,670 --> 01:14:57,550
make sure it's the same one. I ran
into him at a pool hall recently. Yeah,

1357
01:14:57,551 --> 01:15:00,010
he'd be great on that. I love
that dude. And he was spawn,

1358
01:15:00,011 --> 01:15:02,650
if you don't know who that
was, that movie, he played Spa,

1359
01:15:02,651 --> 01:15:04,330
which is a fucking bad ass movie,

1360
01:15:05,140 --> 01:15:08,440
but those spawn comic books are
a perfect example of, it's like,

1361
01:15:08,620 --> 01:15:10,570
that's so outside the box,

1362
01:15:10,571 --> 01:15:14,500
like in comparison to like the shit
that was around just in the 1950s of the

1363
01:15:14,501 --> 01:15:19,501
1960s the really dark
storylines and insane artwork.

1364
01:15:20,310 --> 01:15:25,120
Now that guy, that guy did some wild
shit and then it just went away.

1365
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:30,130
Whatever happened. That dude, I love it.

1366
01:15:30,370 --> 01:15:33,070
She's going to get, well, I'm sure
the guy's rich as fuck. I mean,

1367
01:15:33,071 --> 01:15:37,250
I think if he's gone away,
it's on purpose. You know?
I don't think it's an awe.

1368
01:15:37,690 --> 01:15:39,910
Yeah. Do you know what I'm talking
about? The guy who made spawn,

1369
01:15:40,060 --> 01:15:41,230
did you ever see the spawn comics

1370
01:15:41,410 --> 01:15:44,780
topic? We'll see. It's all before
your time. Yeah, no, I know. It's,

1371
01:15:44,970 --> 01:15:49,540
do you read comics? Um, I
like Terry and the pirates.

1372
01:15:49,990 --> 01:15:51,460
You're in it.
You're in Tony Hawk's video game,

1373
01:15:51,461 --> 01:15:55,030
aren't you guys are unlockable character
Hawker gave me an ass cause I don't

1374
01:15:55,031 --> 01:15:57,460
have an asset and I was like,
I remember they sent me like the,

1375
01:15:57,461 --> 01:15:59,410
the CGI whatever thing and it's like,

1376
01:15:59,740 --> 01:16:02,620
because you go in and they do a little
scan thing or whatever and I remember

1377
01:16:02,621 --> 01:16:05,760
going like, Whoa, you guys give me
like a [inaudible]. That's good.

1378
01:16:05,830 --> 01:16:09,010
I usually played as your character
because I like playing girl characters for

1379
01:16:09,011 --> 01:16:11,880
some reason. Yeah. They gave me like my
wristband. My hair is all ran and like,

1380
01:16:12,190 --> 01:16:16,730
it's cool. You played me that they had
that skateboard. Where'd you stepped on?

1381
01:16:16,780 --> 01:16:18,940
I didn't know. It wasn't my
favorite Tony Hawk game, but it was,

1382
01:16:18,941 --> 01:16:22,000
that was cool seeing I and
oh man. That's awesome. Yeah,

1383
01:16:22,430 --> 01:16:27,430
there's a weird emotional connection when
you tattoo someone for like you're on

1384
01:16:27,861 --> 01:16:31,730
them for life, you know? I know. Like
for Eddie mean that that thing is,

1385
01:16:31,731 --> 01:16:33,020
that's a very important to him.

1386
01:16:33,021 --> 01:16:36,020
He's talked about meet tears up
when he talks about his grandmother.

1387
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:39,680
What is that like for you to have all
these people running around there,

1388
01:16:39,681 --> 01:16:43,700
that you have this intense emotional
connection with something that you've

1389
01:16:43,701 --> 01:16:44,870
created on their body?

1390
01:16:45,850 --> 01:16:49,070
Oh man, it's awesome. I
remember one time I was, um,

1391
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:52,600
driving to work and this guy was crossing
the street and I just, he's really,

1392
01:16:52,601 --> 01:16:53,291
really tall.

1393
01:16:53,291 --> 01:16:56,590
And I remember he looked
like a businessman with a
button up shirt and he's just

1394
01:16:56,591 --> 01:16:58,390
walking across the street and
have that kind of curly hair.

1395
01:16:58,391 --> 01:17:01,690
And I was like staring at him like,
I don't want that guy's deal is,

1396
01:17:01,691 --> 01:17:04,790
you know what I mean? Like what does he
do? And I can totally dry him. He has,

1397
01:17:04,810 --> 01:17:06,580
I was like interesting facial features.

1398
01:17:06,940 --> 01:17:11,300
And then I go into tattoo that day and
he was my appointment and I tattooed him.

1399
01:17:11,301 --> 01:17:12,134
And it was the most,

1400
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:17,500
it was the most intense story of like
living in fear and regret and just making

1401
01:17:18,081 --> 01:17:20,540
closure with all these, with, with death,

1402
01:17:20,541 --> 01:17:24,470
which is I think one of the harder
subjects I think for people. And, um,

1403
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:29,630
and then I remember being done with it
and driving back home and seeing him

1404
01:17:29,631 --> 01:17:33,800
cross the street again to go to where
his car was parked and I was like, oh,

1405
01:17:33,801 --> 01:17:38,090
it's like every person could be that
guy as I just always think about that

1406
01:17:38,540 --> 01:17:41,750
people, especially people who piss me off
or annoy me or whatever am I was like,

1407
01:17:41,780 --> 01:17:45,410
ah, like you just don't know. You know?
So it's, it's a cool connection. I think

1408
01:17:46,070 --> 01:17:49,640
you might be the crazy link to the
other dimension. It might be you,

1409
01:17:49,940 --> 01:17:52,880
it might've been your magic that you
used on Eddie there. That's ridiculous.

1410
01:17:52,881 --> 01:17:56,990
You're connected to another
of course. Synchronicity like
that. Yeah, all the time.

1411
01:17:57,050 --> 01:17:58,400
That's so bizarre.

1412
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:03,230
You tattooed you to talk into the mic,
Bro. You covered a tattoo on site.

1413
01:18:03,340 --> 01:18:06,240
You talked about this before in a
different interview where you've covered a

1414
01:18:06,241 --> 01:18:09,050
tattoo of a dude on his dick.
Right.

1415
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:14,430
We're addicted. It was so funny
because I think when the, it's true,

1416
01:18:14,820 --> 01:18:16,050
when I first got on TV,
you know,

1417
01:18:16,051 --> 01:18:20,040
like they always ask you like the first
like elementary questions. It's like,

1418
01:18:20,041 --> 01:18:22,150
what was your first tattoo with
the weirdest? How do you didn't,

1419
01:18:22,160 --> 01:18:26,330
they're always like pussy foot
around like that question. Like,

1420
01:18:26,460 --> 01:18:30,030
so have you ever tattooed, you know, like
a weird area. I'm just like, just say it,

1421
01:18:30,031 --> 01:18:33,450
you know, but whole have you done
by home? Oh that's very recent.

1422
01:18:33,820 --> 01:18:36,720
Girls are starting to do the button.
We'll talk to us. No, that's awful.

1423
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:44,000
That's awful. Yeah. I mean that's like
sacred ground. No, it's physically uh,

1424
01:18:44,070 --> 01:18:45,600
you know,
take all the funny stuff.

1425
01:18:45,601 --> 01:18:48,090
But it's like physically a
very unhealthy thing to do.

1426
01:18:48,091 --> 01:18:52,620
Like the amount of toxins
and whatever. But anyways,
maybe wipe, oh, so the actual,

1427
01:18:52,621 --> 01:18:56,340
the, the, the more sensitive tissue. It
probably give you hemorrhoids immediately,

1428
01:18:56,341 --> 01:19:01,230
I would imagine. You know, he was going to
have problems, dude. And then, you know,

1429
01:19:01,260 --> 01:19:05,470
that area's really hard to keep
clean for some reason. You know,

1430
01:19:05,490 --> 01:19:07,760
I would have to go with a
doctor drew one on this.

1431
01:19:08,060 --> 01:19:12,530
Yeah. I would think drew
might be right about assholes

1432
01:19:14,060 --> 01:19:14,893
out there.

1433
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:19,550
Are you crazy pitches of Kat von D
is disgusting with asshole tattoos.

1434
01:19:22,670 --> 01:19:26,120
That's just attention seeking and there's
no art aspect behind that. Well maybe

1435
01:19:26,330 --> 01:19:28,220
beautiful job they made
me, it's like, you know,

1436
01:19:28,221 --> 01:19:32,090
some roses in the center of them all
scrunchy and shit and maybe it's just done

1437
01:19:32,091 --> 01:19:35,330
to be like the most amazing rose.
Like your asshole looks like a row

1438
01:19:35,430 --> 01:19:36,330
now for the coq one.

1439
01:19:36,331 --> 01:19:39,630
Did you have to have it hard the whole
time when you're tattooing it or do you

1440
01:19:39,631 --> 01:19:40,880
know what I mean?
Like when you were talking to him,

1441
01:19:40,970 --> 01:19:42,710
a woman,
you shouldn't make that jerk off

1442
01:19:43,090 --> 01:19:47,420
and I say it hard. You were,
you were actually doing that.

1443
01:19:47,930 --> 01:19:49,170
I can explain this situation

1444
01:19:49,170 --> 01:19:52,100
because it sounds so much more
perverted than it was. But like it was,

1445
01:19:52,180 --> 01:19:54,780
there's a guy who, um, you know,

1446
01:19:54,820 --> 01:19:59,820
I had been through some times and had
gotten a lot of ghetto gang tattoos and

1447
01:20:00,031 --> 01:20:02,190
stuff at all, like homemade,
like tad, you know,

1448
01:20:02,220 --> 01:20:05,010
the guitar string tattoo collection yet.

1449
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:09,120
And so we went through over years
and redid all of them, you know,

1450
01:20:09,121 --> 01:20:12,390
and he had all these brand new tattoos,
I'm covered and improved or whatever.

1451
01:20:12,391 --> 01:20:15,960
And then I remember, I mean,
we became, I become friends,

1452
01:20:16,050 --> 01:20:19,710
friends with all my clients, cause
you spend such intimate mo like times,

1453
01:20:19,711 --> 01:20:21,180
like it's like three hours of intense.

1454
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:26,280
We're not talking about like a butthole
tattoos are like talking about like,

1455
01:20:26,281 --> 01:20:31,200
you know, life and death and stuff and, or
whatever we talk about. And, um, I always,

1456
01:20:31,350 --> 01:20:36,000
I'm always so heavy. I hate
that. Um, but uh, he was cool.

1457
01:20:36,001 --> 01:20:39,030
And then he came to me very respectfully
with his wife and was like, you know,

1458
01:20:39,031 --> 01:20:41,970
I have this one tattoo and now
that I'm remarried and stuff,

1459
01:20:42,330 --> 01:20:46,260
no longer with Linda and like,
um, I was just, you know,

1460
01:20:46,261 --> 01:20:48,690
I understand if you don't want to do
it, it's fine. But it's just, you know,

1461
01:20:48,691 --> 01:20:49,800
it kind of bothers them.

1462
01:20:50,340 --> 01:20:54,550
And she was like, name on the
deck. The word Linda. Yeah. Linda.

1463
01:20:55,480 --> 01:20:56,960
Linda is no,

1464
01:20:58,530 --> 01:21:02,390
said La. No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1465
01:21:02,930 --> 01:21:06,020
What did you change it to?
No. So he comes, I'm like,
yeah man, it's cool. You know,

1466
01:21:06,021 --> 01:21:11,000
and so like he can't, he comes with his
wife. No, he goes with his wife and um,

1467
01:21:11,420 --> 01:21:15,170
and so I was like, yeah, you
know, like I'll put up like
the partitioners you know,

1468
01:21:15,171 --> 01:21:17,750
that you see at the hospital and stuff
so that others can watch or whatever.

1469
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:21,960
And No, you don't get an erection
during that time. Uh, I don't think you,

1470
01:21:22,250 --> 01:21:24,260
unless you're willing to spread
it out like a butterfly though.

1471
01:21:25,670 --> 01:21:30,500
I had him lay down and then he whips
this tremendous thing. It's so crazy.

1472
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:35,540
Like it was like, Oh, why? And
a apostrophe s it was like,

1473
01:21:35,750 --> 01:21:37,490
wow.
Hours and hours,

1474
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:41,360
apostrophe s Linda's hours
and hours of tattooing.

1475
01:21:41,550 --> 01:21:45,890
And I was just basically saying it was
quite a large tattoo cause large penis.

1476
01:21:45,891 --> 01:21:47,450
You took your time on it as well,

1477
01:21:47,900 --> 01:21:50,630
just to clarify the penis and
the tattoo or both large. Yeah.

1478
01:21:50,631 --> 01:21:55,280
I mean it would be like you talking
to an ob Gyn about, you know, uh,

1479
01:21:55,860 --> 01:21:58,160
eight inches. She, you know, you,

1480
01:21:58,170 --> 01:22:02,010
it might've been like talking to an ob
Gyn to a dude who's got a girl touching

1481
01:22:02,011 --> 01:22:04,740
his penis, even under such,
in auspicious circumstances.

1482
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:09,150
And there's like hovering over, you know,
he's whatever. And it's not that way.

1483
01:22:09,151 --> 01:22:13,440
I mean, it's like, oh, that's
so silly. It's always that
way. There's not 90% of it.

1484
01:22:13,470 --> 01:22:16,770
Maybe only 10% that way, but 10%
is that way. They're probably gone.

1485
01:22:16,771 --> 01:22:21,390
You go to your doctor and he touches your
week. My doctor doesn't look like you.

1486
01:22:22,590 --> 01:22:26,760
I, my doctor looked like you and touched
my penis. I'm sure I'd have a problem.

1487
01:22:26,770 --> 01:22:30,180
Yeah, I might have to beat off before
it got to the office to have it. You

1488
01:22:31,850 --> 01:22:35,340
wouldn't want to see it that way. He
does that. Oh my God, you're so crazy,

1489
01:22:35,620 --> 01:22:40,500
but why don't you go online and look
up doctor, doctor porn like doctor,

1490
01:22:40,501 --> 01:22:43,520
the female doctors who make out
with the men and have sex with me.

1491
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:46,260
I know what you need. You don't
need medicine. You need sugar.

1492
01:22:46,670 --> 01:22:50,550
All of those that don't say no.
It's not sad. It's just reality.

1493
01:22:50,551 --> 01:22:53,730
It's nothing wrong with that. Dude's
reality's very sad. It's not sad.

1494
01:22:53,731 --> 01:22:56,640
Dudes would be massively
attracted to this idea that a,

1495
01:22:56,641 --> 01:23:00,760
a beautiful doctor is going to get
intimate with them. I'm not going to get,

1496
01:23:01,190 --> 01:23:04,980
but even just touching their
intimate parts in some sort of a, uh,

1497
01:23:05,070 --> 01:23:06,310
a doctor sort of a thing.

1498
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:10,600
Like, so what's wrong with your penis,
Johnny? I brought this up. I apologize.

1499
01:23:10,780 --> 01:23:13,390
Don't be mad at me for all of them.
Well,

1500
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:18,060
all I'm saying is you're a
beautiful woman and I were a doctor.

1501
01:23:18,070 --> 01:23:18,811
A certain amount of,

1502
01:23:18,811 --> 01:23:22,690
of your patients would most certainly
love it if you examine their penis.

1503
01:23:22,780 --> 01:23:24,160
You know what?
I don't think it's that way

1504
01:23:24,580 --> 01:23:28,350
much anymore in mind. You that this, I
did that tattoo when I was like, you know,

1505
01:23:29,160 --> 01:23:30,120
I dunno, like 19. Right

1506
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:34,280
when you were even hotter. Oh, thanks. Oh,

1507
01:23:34,940 --> 01:23:39,610
he's retarded today.
Jesus Christ can help your point.

1508
01:23:39,670 --> 01:23:42,910
It doesn't help your point.
It was when I was 17.

1509
01:23:44,050 --> 01:23:45,190
Like that makes it better.

1510
01:23:45,240 --> 01:23:49,270
She's drunk back then and I was
totally out of shape versus now. Yeah.

1511
01:23:49,330 --> 01:23:52,270
What you're saying, you're
saying she looks worse? No,

1512
01:23:52,271 --> 01:23:55,680
I'm just so I can remember him saying
that. I've never seen that to a girl.

1513
01:23:55,720 --> 01:23:58,970
I wasn't saying that. Okay, so I have
Polish. So what did you turn it in?

1514
01:23:59,030 --> 01:24:01,180
I was trying to be funny
and sad at the time.

1515
01:24:01,181 --> 01:24:05,500
He just wanted to get the
Linda's [inaudible] apostrophe
s like Linda's Dick.

1516
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:10,480
Wow. She's, this is Linda's. If
not anymore. Linda is still alive.

1517
01:24:10,570 --> 01:24:11,590
Fuck yet she's alive.

1518
01:24:11,710 --> 01:24:16,060
Linda's she took resell the Blanco's
place in Columbia then does down there

1519
01:24:16,061 --> 01:24:19,540
running shit cap and motherfuckers
and drive around in a 10 speed.

1520
01:24:19,540 --> 01:24:20,590
So what did you turn it into?

1521
01:24:21,350 --> 01:24:25,420
I think it was just like some tribal
design or something like that. The Bible,

1522
01:24:25,770 --> 01:24:30,370
it was like you don't, you don't
have that much worse. You guys stop.

1523
01:24:30,371 --> 01:24:33,940
Sorry. She did some biomech on
that shit. Crazy. All My, all my,

1524
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:37,780
all my work goes down to this.
Some Geiger Shit too.

1525
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:41,200
I want to get tower seven on
my whole would not listen.

1526
01:24:41,201 --> 01:24:42,400
We're definitely not saying that.

1527
01:24:42,640 --> 01:24:45,730
It just did the portrait of his
new wife on top of that shit

1528
01:24:47,620 --> 01:24:52,620
with a chainsaw cutting Linda up like
a chain saw hitting linen and blood

1529
01:24:52,781 --> 01:24:55,960
splattered all over.
So it's not Linda's fuck that bitch.

1530
01:24:56,230 --> 01:24:59,350
Why didn't he ops to get the
laser on the penis? I don't know.

1531
01:24:59,380 --> 01:25:01,270
We know what I don't know. Back
then, I don't think it was as,

1532
01:25:05,590 --> 01:25:08,610
I'm like scanning my brain
for any other tattoo.

1533
01:25:08,611 --> 01:25:12,850
You reference like laser or
needles. Are you, are you like,

1534
01:25:12,910 --> 01:25:17,170
did you have to like pull on it and
like how did you want your butterfly?

1535
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:18,393
Yeah,

1536
01:25:19,670 --> 01:25:22,970
no, I mean like if somebody was
sitting, like if he was sitting here,

1537
01:25:22,990 --> 01:25:27,930
then I would get dental bibs around all
of it and then I would just, Oh God,

1538
01:25:27,931 --> 01:25:31,410
this is awful. No, it's,
no, no, no. There's no,

1539
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:33,750
there's no way is it sexual?

1540
01:25:34,180 --> 01:25:37,270
Oh, for sure. No, I'm not saying
that. We're not saying you got off.

1541
01:25:38,870 --> 01:25:42,670
Oh my God. The, the middle
of saying, we're just saying,

1542
01:25:44,290 --> 01:25:47,930
man, you got it. Is, it is
a very extraordinary task.

1543
01:25:47,940 --> 01:25:51,660
You guys take your knuckles and do that.
I had to give him, what did he say?

1544
01:25:51,661 --> 01:25:55,020
He just said, did you spit
on it? Oh, come on, man.

1545
01:25:55,021 --> 01:25:59,610
That's in the moment. It was, it
was just one of those Daniel Tosh.

1546
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:04,140
Sorry. With the moment. It wasn't forever.
He's ridiculous. Ah, yeah. Look, it's

1547
01:26:04,170 --> 01:26:07,460
certainly, it was not sexual. I
mean it has to be insanely painful.

1548
01:26:07,640 --> 01:26:09,170
You'd have to be like a really sick,

1549
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:12,380
but then there's a lot of sick fucks who
were like really into pain, right? No,

1550
01:26:12,381 --> 01:26:12,910
I think

1551
01:26:12,910 --> 01:26:14,980
more embarrassed than anything
and he was really, again,

1552
01:26:14,981 --> 01:26:17,880
like his wife was there and it was
a very, you know, I think he was,

1553
01:26:19,250 --> 01:26:21,430
I would have made sure it allows
them to have sex right before,

1554
01:26:21,431 --> 01:26:25,450
just just in case. Do you think that's
Linda's Goto Shit. The Linda just,

1555
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:30,010
you get a tattoo, my name on your
Dick Damn Way. This kind of work.

1556
01:26:32,140 --> 01:26:35,290
She's like, she's a Catholic.
A headboard with like notches.

1557
01:26:35,291 --> 01:26:37,660
And how many dudes have
tattooed her name on their deck?

1558
01:26:37,990 --> 01:26:40,900
Cic is what a gangster chick.
That chick must be.

1559
01:26:41,230 --> 01:26:46,090
Maybe it was his idea to get her back.
Don't doubt it. We need another story.

1560
01:26:46,350 --> 01:26:49,960
Numbers. Sorry. You guys
are still friends, right?
No, I mean, no, no. Hold on.

1561
01:26:49,961 --> 01:26:52,020
Call that dude up. I'll email them. Know

1562
01:26:53,860 --> 01:26:57,570
some things you don't know me,
but I know about your day.

1563
01:26:58,660 --> 01:27:01,420
Just curious. Yeah, that's
just don't have the answer.

1564
01:27:01,421 --> 01:27:04,310
Have you ever been in the middle
of tattooing someone and Oh,

1565
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:07,060
well for whatever reason they just
told them to get the fuck out of there.

1566
01:27:07,061 --> 01:27:10,480
Like I can't do you, you're giving
me bad energy. You're annoying your,

1567
01:27:10,660 --> 01:27:13,430
you're crying too much
or have you ever had like

1568
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:16,300
to stop a tattoo?
Um,

1569
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:20,570
probably because of stench a
couple of times now or anything.

1570
01:27:20,730 --> 01:27:24,600
No damn bad.
Wiper guys are awful.

1571
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:31,620
Um, no, I dunno. Um, there
was one tattoo that I fuck,

1572
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:35,850
these don't sound like interesting
stories to me, but they probably are. Um,

1573
01:27:37,860 --> 01:27:42,350
oh yeah. Um, twice. There's
two different people that um,

1574
01:27:43,470 --> 01:27:48,180
like their wife went into labor
during their, their, uh, Tattoo.

1575
01:27:48,210 --> 01:27:48,730
One of them was,

1576
01:27:48,730 --> 01:27:52,310
it's probably because they knew the
wife knew that you were tattooing the

1577
01:27:52,311 --> 01:27:57,100
husband and just awesome.
Like I remember was like mirror survey.

1578
01:27:57,101 --> 01:28:00,770
How Tattoo chick. All right. I'm
not smart husband. No, no. I,

1579
01:28:01,140 --> 01:28:04,310
this is a great story because it
was, it was very sweet actually. Um,

1580
01:28:04,390 --> 01:28:07,400
it was Mira Sorvino is, has been, and she,

1581
01:28:07,420 --> 01:28:12,420
he was getting a pinup girl version of
her tattooed on his leg and then halfway

1582
01:28:13,031 --> 01:28:14,950
through he got the phone
call and we're like, oh,

1583
01:28:14,990 --> 01:28:17,710
we'll just finish it another day. And
sweet. I thought that was nice. Oh,

1584
01:28:17,711 --> 01:28:20,790
Dennis Sweet. For sure. Yeah.
Is there a moment that interest,

1585
01:28:20,791 --> 01:28:24,010
does anybody ever come to you with some
like crazy demonic shit and you're like,

1586
01:28:24,040 --> 01:28:25,840
ah, I just don't want to
get into this? I mean,

1587
01:28:25,841 --> 01:28:28,700
I don't do any tattoos that really go
against the navy. Like my moral, I mean,

1588
01:28:28,701 --> 01:28:29,200
you know,

1589
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:32,620
the crazy thing is nowadays
it's so different than it
when it used to be like I

1590
01:28:32,621 --> 01:28:33,940
used to,
um,

1591
01:28:34,430 --> 01:28:39,010
I just tattoo a lot of the people who
are getting tattooed by me now or just

1592
01:28:39,011 --> 01:28:39,860
more serious collectors.

1593
01:28:39,860 --> 01:28:43,210
So I'm not really dealing with a lot
of riff raff for weirdness of, yeah.

1594
01:28:43,330 --> 01:28:46,960
But in the past, I'm digging deep
into the paths right now. So, yeah.

1595
01:28:46,961 --> 01:28:48,870
I mean there's sometimes,
uh,

1596
01:28:49,150 --> 01:28:53,440
people would come in and wanting to get
tattoos that I don't necessarily agree

1597
01:28:53,441 --> 01:28:56,200
with or like I don't,
I don't need the money,

1598
01:28:56,201 --> 01:28:59,680
so I don't need to tattoo you if I
don't feel good about it, you know,

1599
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:02,730
if it's something creepy. Yeah.
Though it is my gift to the person.

1600
01:29:02,731 --> 01:29:05,340
It's also a collaborative experience,
so I have to feel good about it.

1601
01:29:05,341 --> 01:29:08,730
So it also goes for like, things that
I don't think I'm good at. You know,

1602
01:29:08,731 --> 01:29:11,740
there's certain things that aren't,
I'm not, I'm just not good at.

1603
01:29:12,220 --> 01:29:15,280
I would bet that you would be really
good if you wanted to do like some fall

1604
01:29:15,380 --> 01:29:19,610
booth type shit.
I call my old stuffy evil shit.

1605
01:29:20,060 --> 01:29:23,110
I like stuff like that. Do that
kind of thing. Yeah. I like,

1606
01:29:23,230 --> 01:29:24,610
I just, all kinds of art,
you know what I mean?

1607
01:29:24,611 --> 01:29:27,630
I think some of the creepiest stuff is
a lot of like the old Catholic artwork

1608
01:29:27,730 --> 01:29:32,350
and it's the reason that it's so
striking and it's so, um, you know, uh,

1609
01:29:32,570 --> 01:29:35,950
it, it, it affects and moves people
is because there's like, it's very,

1610
01:29:36,730 --> 01:29:40,900
it gives you fear. It's
amazing. It's powerful. So I
love that stuff. Um, you know,

1611
01:29:40,990 --> 01:29:44,530
I wear a lot of crosses and stuff and
I may not be for the meanings that most

1612
01:29:44,531 --> 01:29:46,930
people assume it would be.
I just like what crosses,

1613
01:29:47,090 --> 01:29:50,210
well, a friend of mine went to
Italy and a while he was there,

1614
01:29:50,211 --> 01:29:55,211
he took a photo of the sealing of some
religious place that the outside edge of

1615
01:29:56,661 --> 01:29:58,580
the photo,
the Center is Heaven,

1616
01:29:59,350 --> 01:30:03,950
grace and the outside edge is all
these demons and they're shoving like

1617
01:30:03,951 --> 01:30:08,360
pitchforks up dudes asses
crazy back then elite in 10.

1618
01:30:08,940 --> 01:30:12,840
The Hieronymus Bosch stuff. I mean,
that's just like, I think faith in the 15,

1619
01:30:12,841 --> 01:30:17,610
16 hundreds isn't like the, the uh,
date Danish. I think he was. Um,

1620
01:30:17,790 --> 01:30:19,450
I mean that shit was so ahead of its time.

1621
01:30:19,580 --> 01:30:24,290
Oh yeah. It's crazy. Scary,
weird. And back then mean
they really believe that too.

1622
01:30:24,291 --> 01:30:26,120
I mean, when you were drawing
those paintings of the,

1623
01:30:26,240 --> 01:30:29,210
the demons skewering dudes
in their assholes, like,

1624
01:30:29,211 --> 01:30:32,630
people really thought that that was going
to happen to you if you died and you

1625
01:30:32,631 --> 01:30:36,020
went to hell. Well, I think, uh,
Caravaggios one of my favorite. Yeah.

1626
01:30:36,150 --> 01:30:40,790
Uh, you know, from that era, I think he
was one of the first more influential, uh,

1627
01:30:40,950 --> 01:30:45,550
painters of the time that started doing
renditions of a biblical stories and

1628
01:30:45,551 --> 01:30:48,990
stuff. But painting like Jesus and, um,

1629
01:30:49,540 --> 01:30:53,200
painting Jesus more than like a,
a very human like fashion. So it,

1630
01:30:53,350 --> 01:30:56,330
it was even more real. Do you know what
I mean? It wasn't like this, you know,

1631
01:30:56,380 --> 01:30:59,530
golden era, like aura and raise
and wings and all that stuff.

1632
01:30:59,531 --> 01:31:01,930
It's like even made him
look like you and I,

1633
01:31:01,931 --> 01:31:06,880
and so you would see like crucifixion
pieces and stuff that, I mean,

1634
01:31:06,910 --> 01:31:08,230
you feel it.
It's like

1635
01:31:08,370 --> 01:31:09,990
it's fucked up when you look crazy.

1636
01:31:10,020 --> 01:31:14,100
All the old crucifixion images
crucifixions are crazy just to begin with

1637
01:31:14,101 --> 01:31:16,270
straight up. It's a crazy
way to kill somebody. I mean,

1638
01:31:16,271 --> 01:31:19,710
if you just wander around there,
yeah, it's nuts. I mean, but,

1639
01:31:19,740 --> 01:31:24,140
but in the old pictures, he was always
like in pretty good shape except for the,

1640
01:31:24,141 --> 01:31:28,920
the holes in his arms. I mean, he
wasn't all fucked up. Some body fat,

1641
01:31:29,700 --> 01:31:32,700
some selling. I meant what I meant was
he was okay. He wasn't all fucked up,

1642
01:31:32,870 --> 01:31:36,780
but like the Mel Gibson movie. Yeah,
but you liked the interpretation of it.

1643
01:31:36,810 --> 01:31:39,710
Now it's like if you go to
see that and Mel Gibson movie,

1644
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:42,990
that's our version of what would have
happened when he, but that was horrific.

1645
01:31:43,020 --> 01:31:45,600
I mean it was really
scary shit. Like the, the,

1646
01:31:45,601 --> 01:31:49,710
the beatings that they did to him and
then they had to have that fake body that

1647
01:31:49,711 --> 01:31:53,420
was like bleeding and all these different
areas. I mean it was like a fake robot.

1648
01:31:53,430 --> 01:31:56,010
She was like the medieval torture
devices that have been made. I mean,

1649
01:31:56,011 --> 01:31:59,330
it's crazy that people even like
invented or thought of things that you,

1650
01:31:59,460 --> 01:32:00,190
the racks

1651
01:32:00,190 --> 01:32:02,970
and iron maiden's all that horrifying.
No.

1652
01:32:03,210 --> 01:32:06,550
Have you ever seen pictures of
the cat piano they used to have?

1653
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:10,090
This is not the only like a hundred
years ago where they had like a bunch of

1654
01:32:10,091 --> 01:32:13,360
cats lined up and had these things
that poke the cat and make them me out.

1655
01:32:13,540 --> 01:32:18,130
And you played the piano,
the keys. Well, yeah.

1656
01:32:18,190 --> 01:32:22,330
They didn't give a fuck about cats back
then. Yeah. The mortality rate for people.

1657
01:32:22,630 --> 01:32:25,510
I do too. I love my cat marsh. She
would stop peeing in my fucking house.

1658
01:32:25,730 --> 01:32:27,970
How many cats do you have? A
little bitch. I only have one.

1659
01:32:28,060 --> 01:32:31,150
I'm not a crazy cat lady. I just
love my cat. When another one

1660
01:32:32,740 --> 01:32:36,070
hairless cause I have a hairless cat
and they get kind of the opposite.

1661
01:32:36,130 --> 01:32:39,310
He's got full Harry cause your
cat would just kick his cuts.

1662
01:32:39,350 --> 01:32:42,760
Asshole is cat's a fluff
ball. Aw, that's cute.

1663
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:46,540
I can't stop my cat from peeing in my
fucking house. She just likes to not Pete.

1664
01:32:46,541 --> 01:32:50,500
Where the litter beer boxes he the
most boring interview for you guys like

1665
01:32:50,501 --> 01:32:54,020
talking about why? Well I dunno know. I
know we always go there. We always go.

1666
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:59,320
We might be talking about this
seriously. No, no. It's not boring to us.

1667
01:32:59,321 --> 01:33:00,730
You're not boring at all.
Don't even say that.

1668
01:33:00,731 --> 01:33:04,180
That's not what it is that we talk
about anything and everything.

1669
01:33:04,210 --> 01:33:07,210
There's a cat clock. You're the fucking
thing goes off every hour at my house.

1670
01:33:07,270 --> 01:33:09,090
Yeah. It ruins story. Arc has 10 minutes.

1671
01:33:09,390 --> 01:33:11,890
You're going to hear me and you got to go.
What the fuck?

1672
01:33:11,891 --> 01:33:15,010
There's cats all over the desk. Clue who
the guy is obsessed with cats. Oh yeah.

1673
01:33:15,011 --> 01:33:17,140
You have something wrong with him.
I don't know what it is.

1674
01:33:17,170 --> 01:33:19,370
I just like the lucky count. I don't
know what the fuck's wrong with them,

1675
01:33:19,371 --> 01:33:23,030
but he's okay. Do you ever do this fucking
Chad Tattoos? I've done done one. Yeah.

1676
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:25,840
Before a couple of times back
in the day. Yeah. That's cool.

1677
01:33:26,470 --> 01:33:29,320
What did you first start
off practicing on Jews?

1678
01:33:29,321 --> 01:33:34,130
Pigskin and I just had two people,
but see how is, how was it? No, no,

1679
01:33:34,131 --> 01:33:36,700
no.
I was underage so I had a

1680
01:33:37,260 --> 01:33:39,460
plethora of friends that were
under agent couldn't get tattooed,

1681
01:33:39,461 --> 01:33:43,320
so they were just oh wow. See, tattooed
them or did you get the needles? Um,

1682
01:33:43,350 --> 01:33:46,550
well at the time I had a friend that
believed in me and who worked at a shop.

1683
01:33:46,580 --> 01:33:50,040
I mean, you know, I was, this was in the
ghetto in San Bernardino, so it's like,

1684
01:33:50,430 --> 01:33:52,140
things were a lot different
than they are now.

1685
01:33:52,170 --> 01:33:54,630
And so like my first shop that
I worked at, I remember, uh,

1686
01:33:54,631 --> 01:33:56,580
it was called Sin City Tattoo at the time.

1687
01:33:56,610 --> 01:33:58,080
It was like on Highland and East street,

1688
01:33:58,081 --> 01:34:01,380
which is like such a really
gnarly apart out there.

1689
01:34:01,381 --> 01:34:03,870
I don't know if it's cleaned up, but I
know there's a jail right down the street.

1690
01:34:03,871 --> 01:34:05,910
But um, that's never good. Yeah,

1691
01:34:05,911 --> 01:34:07,860
there's like people getting
robbed all the time except us.

1692
01:34:07,861 --> 01:34:11,590
Cause I think we were tattooing all
the thieves and stuff, but um, and,

1693
01:34:11,810 --> 01:34:12,541
and back then,

1694
01:34:12,541 --> 01:34:15,600
like the wars between tattoo shops
are so different and it's all bikers.

1695
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:16,260
You know,
like my,

1696
01:34:16,260 --> 01:34:20,490
my boss come to think of it like probably
that probably wasn't even his real

1697
01:34:20,491 --> 01:34:23,760
name. I mean, I don't, you know,
like he was gnarly. I mean,

1698
01:34:23,790 --> 01:34:25,740
there was wars between Tattoo show.
Yeah.

1699
01:34:25,741 --> 01:34:29,550
Like if you opened up a shop in a mile
radius that you would get, I mean, we,

1700
01:34:29,940 --> 01:34:33,200
I remember we'd get shot at,
um, what are, what is it called?

1701
01:34:33,270 --> 01:34:35,780
Something cocktails with the
fire and Molotov cocktail.

1702
01:34:35,810 --> 01:34:40,110
Get those through the window. Really?
Oh yeah. It was crazy. Just, it's just,

1703
01:34:40,111 --> 01:34:43,280
it was rough. You guys were working,
this would happen or is it half the time?

1704
01:34:43,281 --> 01:34:46,670
I mean, I think my first, yeah, I mean it
was pretty brutal. There's reasons for my,

1705
01:34:46,830 --> 01:34:48,900
I feel bad for my parents
because they're like, oh my God.

1706
01:34:48,901 --> 01:34:50,550
They had to like imagine all the things,

1707
01:34:51,110 --> 01:34:54,090
and I was 16 when I first got into that
shop and I remember going, hey man,

1708
01:34:54,091 --> 01:34:57,670
I'm under age. And he's like,
he looks at my shitty portfolio,

1709
01:34:57,860 --> 01:35:00,800
Polaroids that were blurry and crappy.
And he was like, Eh, and then, uh,

1710
01:35:00,980 --> 01:35:05,300
I shouldn't have my drawings.
And he goes, AH, okay. Yeah,
you could do it. Um, and he,

1711
01:35:05,301 --> 01:35:08,120
I remember he used to say, you're going
to fly far, far away. What? I'm like, no,

1712
01:35:08,121 --> 01:35:12,040
I'm going to stay here forever. Like,
see you later. San Bernandino. But

1713
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:14,470
wow,
you sold them down the river.

1714
01:35:14,580 --> 01:35:19,440
No. You know, it was such a rough, it
was such a rough place to, you know,

1715
01:35:19,441 --> 01:35:23,410
it was just a rough place for a
16 year old girl to be at. But um,

1716
01:35:23,430 --> 01:35:27,420
San Bernardino's refer your
60. Yeah, totally. It's rough
for everybody. That's a,

1717
01:35:27,421 --> 01:35:31,470
that's a tricky area. Yeah. And I lived
right down the street with a prostitute.

1718
01:35:31,471 --> 01:35:35,540
At the time and it was rough,
you know, I mean she, it was,
it was awful. He Buddies?

1719
01:35:35,930 --> 01:35:36,331
No,
no,

1720
01:35:36,331 --> 01:35:39,070
I met her because I had been working at
a movie theater before that passenger

1721
01:35:39,071 --> 01:35:42,720
out popcorn and like she worked there
and I needed a place to stay next to the

1722
01:35:42,721 --> 01:35:44,430
shop and so,
um,

1723
01:35:44,550 --> 01:35:48,420
I would pretty much take care of her
kids while she would go in and out of her

1724
01:35:48,421 --> 01:35:51,810
drug. Comatose. So sad. It's
very sad. Wow. Really hard.

1725
01:35:52,350 --> 01:35:55,380
But I just knew that if I
could be close to the shop,

1726
01:35:55,381 --> 01:35:59,100
I could tattoo everyday in practice and
I would literally go in and open the

1727
01:35:59,101 --> 01:36:02,250
shop and stay until minute.
Like, you know, it was like
11 to midnight every day.

1728
01:36:02,251 --> 01:36:02,760
I tattooed

1729
01:36:02,760 --> 01:36:03,780
so much back then.

1730
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:07,140
How long did it take before
you were comfortable with
the medium of skin of like

1731
01:36:07,141 --> 01:36:09,870
moving it around, pulling
it to manipulate it? Yeah,

1732
01:36:10,750 --> 01:36:13,630
comfortable from the beginning with
that was because when I was tattooing,

1733
01:36:14,010 --> 01:36:16,930
I'm professionally outside of a shop,
not, I didn't know what I was doing,

1734
01:36:16,931 --> 01:36:21,190
so there was no bar to, I was like, oh
cool. You want to get a misfit school,

1735
01:36:21,191 --> 01:36:24,360
it's awesome. And like I would just
tattoo it and it'd be like, Eh,

1736
01:36:24,370 --> 01:36:26,860
it was like eight hours later like,
but um,

1737
01:36:26,861 --> 01:36:29,830
then once I got to my first job I had to
unlearn a lot of things and I was like,

1738
01:36:29,831 --> 01:36:33,880
what? There's more than one kind of tattoo
machine and different needles and the

1739
01:36:33,881 --> 01:36:37,330
cleanliness and the sterility aspect
of it, all the important stuff.

1740
01:36:37,331 --> 01:36:40,600
And so I'm just relearning it.
But looking back, you know,

1741
01:36:41,230 --> 01:36:45,550
is actually awesome that I was brought
up in that ghetto upbringing because it

1742
01:36:45,551 --> 01:36:50,350
definitely is the reason why I tattooed
the style that I do because, um, you know,

1743
01:36:50,351 --> 01:36:51,640
gangsters get cool tattoos,

1744
01:36:51,641 --> 01:36:53,770
they all get all the fine line
black and gray stuff and they,

1745
01:36:53,780 --> 01:36:57,340
I did a lot of names and memory
of his and all that stuff and um,

1746
01:36:57,640 --> 01:37:01,690
old English lettering and lots of high
nose and gestures and all this shit.

1747
01:37:01,810 --> 01:37:04,970
I wanted to be a comic book
artist when I was a kid. So yeah,

1748
01:37:05,120 --> 01:37:09,310
I drew a lot of really
good different wild shit.

1749
01:37:09,700 --> 01:37:14,080
One of the things that I did is I drew
on my friends. I would just draw on them.

1750
01:37:14,110 --> 01:37:15,880
Like I would draw fake tattoos on them,

1751
01:37:15,881 --> 01:37:19,580
like really intense detailed fake
tattoos. It would take like hours. Yeah.

1752
01:37:19,750 --> 01:37:23,140
And I did that because I was thinking
about getting a tattoo. Oh yeah. Yeah.

1753
01:37:23,141 --> 01:37:25,490
I still draw you all the time to
see it. Yeah. I'll show you this.

1754
01:37:25,491 --> 01:37:26,324
I'll send you some shit.

1755
01:37:26,380 --> 01:37:29,320
But my best stuff was when I did it
every day and that's when I was in high

1756
01:37:29,321 --> 01:37:30,190
school when I was in height.

1757
01:37:30,370 --> 01:37:34,870
But I had one conti teacher in high school
as an art teacher, it was so negative.

1758
01:37:35,160 --> 01:37:37,000
We want to have anything to do
with art anymore. I was like,

1759
01:37:37,001 --> 01:37:39,750
this guy's just a downer. He's
just, it was always negative.

1760
01:37:39,930 --> 01:37:43,810
I've failed my art classes in school
but in a lot of visitors cause I was too

1761
01:37:43,811 --> 01:37:46,400
punk rock to follow instructions. But
it's like I just, I want to draw it

1762
01:37:46,680 --> 01:37:48,300
the way they are. I don't,
I don't, I mean yeah,

1763
01:37:48,301 --> 01:37:51,480
let's learn about like the history of
fucking cubism or whatever the fuck you

1764
01:37:51,481 --> 01:37:53,010
know.
But like when it comes to drawing stuff,

1765
01:37:53,011 --> 01:37:56,160
I don't want to do two point perspective.
I just want to do it as it is

1766
01:37:56,160 --> 01:38:00,480
and like I'd rather draw this stapler
like as it is versus like you want to do

1767
01:38:00,481 --> 01:38:04,220
what you want to do. Like you can't, you
can't teach in like, you know what I mean?

1768
01:38:04,290 --> 01:38:08,000
It's like you can teach
technique, but anyways, I've
failed. I would fail all this,

1769
01:38:08,040 --> 01:38:10,990
these, these classes and I'm like,
ah, I don't need this shit. Yeah.

1770
01:38:11,130 --> 01:38:14,190
It's like you have an idea
that you want to get out.

1771
01:38:14,191 --> 01:38:17,250
You have your expression that you want
to get out and the problem is when

1772
01:38:17,251 --> 01:38:20,370
someone says, no, I don't want you to
get that out. I want you to work on that.

1773
01:38:20,630 --> 01:38:24,300
It's like you have these brief
moments where these doors are open,

1774
01:38:24,301 --> 01:38:27,000
where this creativity wants to run
through and when you're sitting there,

1775
01:38:27,190 --> 01:38:30,260
I mean in one sense it's good to be
disciplined and it's good to be regimented

1776
01:38:30,261 --> 01:38:31,710
and it's good to have good fundamentals,

1777
01:38:31,890 --> 01:38:34,800
but it's also good to just let
it go when you want to let it go.

1778
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:37,830
Like you could learn all those things
on your own time as far as like

1779
01:38:37,831 --> 01:38:41,430
perspective and granted, I think there
are some good art teachers out there,

1780
01:38:41,431 --> 01:38:44,280
but I think that would be such a tricky
thing to do because it's such a personal

1781
01:38:44,281 --> 01:38:49,110
thing too. You know, it's, it would
require a person that was, you know, Doug,

1782
01:38:49,111 --> 01:38:53,580
Stan hope and I, we've
talked about teaching comedy
classes that you could never,

1783
01:38:53,581 --> 01:38:54,720
first of all,
you can never charge.

1784
01:38:54,721 --> 01:38:56,940
Like there's a lot of people that have
like this comedy classes where you're,

1785
01:38:57,160 --> 01:38:59,180
you know, you, they charged
this ridiculous amount of money.

1786
01:38:59,181 --> 01:39:01,700
You go through all this crazy bullshit
with them and they pretend attorney when

1787
01:39:01,710 --> 01:39:05,310
the comedian and we're like, it
should be free. You can't charge.

1788
01:39:05,490 --> 01:39:08,640
And you really can't give him any fucking
advice because there's almost nothing

1789
01:39:08,641 --> 01:39:09,421
you can tell them.
I mean,

1790
01:39:09,421 --> 01:39:12,710
that should be what the comedy club last
one over the last competition was like

1791
01:39:12,711 --> 01:39:15,810
came to us right here. Oh really? We're
here all the time. As a matter of fact,

1792
01:39:15,811 --> 01:39:19,770
we're here Wednesday night is a Joey Diaz,
Brian Callan,

1793
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:24,240
Duncan Trussell and me. Maybe
Brian if he can come on, sweetie.

1794
01:39:25,440 --> 01:39:30,120
Long story deep story. Okay. We
won't go into that, but um, yeah,

1795
01:39:30,121 --> 01:39:33,870
it's um, it's awesome place. The Ice
House comedy club has been around forever.

1796
01:39:33,871 --> 01:39:37,350
It's been 1961. I think
it's one of the first, uh,

1797
01:39:37,380 --> 01:39:42,150
was opened 50 years.
I did my first set here in 94.

1798
01:39:42,200 --> 01:39:46,100
Really? Yeah. I want to first moved here
from New York. Comedy's hard, man. I,

1799
01:39:46,110 --> 01:39:50,340
there's like, there's a whole, well,
I mean, I just think it's like, it's,

1800
01:39:50,850 --> 01:39:53,850
it's not anybody can just go up
there and tell a story. I mean,

1801
01:39:53,851 --> 01:39:55,380
some people aren't
really good storytellers,

1802
01:39:55,381 --> 01:39:57,450
but I think there's like a whole
thing to it, you know? Well,

1803
01:39:57,451 --> 01:40:00,980
you know how [inaudible] for you when
you sit down and you draw, you know,

1804
01:40:00,990 --> 01:40:04,230
you're the, you know, it's like, you know,
you know, you know how to fucking draw.

1805
01:40:04,260 --> 01:40:06,730
You've been doing it forever.
But if you had never done it before,

1806
01:40:06,731 --> 01:40:10,020
a practice it before really
forced your hand to move.

1807
01:40:10,021 --> 01:40:12,780
And the way that you want it to
in order to create this image,

1808
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:15,600
it'd be almost alien,
almost impossible for a lot of people.

1809
01:40:15,601 --> 01:40:19,440
They look at the artwork that you do
and it's almost incomprehensible to wrap

1810
01:40:19,441 --> 01:40:21,600
their head around how much is how someone
could recreate something like that.

1811
01:40:21,601 --> 01:40:24,360
How can you do that? How can you
do that? So same thing with comedy.

1812
01:40:24,540 --> 01:40:27,480
You do it enough times
or Jujitsu or music,

1813
01:40:27,510 --> 01:40:31,420
you do it enough times and it just
becomes, it becomes you. It becomes, yeah.

1814
01:40:31,440 --> 01:40:35,070
But yeah, it's hard to get there, but
not really. I mean it is and it isn't.

1815
01:40:35,220 --> 01:40:37,770
It's like Joey Dia said it best.
He said comedy is the hardest,

1816
01:40:37,771 --> 01:40:41,610
easiest thing you'll ever do because it's
fucking really hard to be good at it.

1817
01:40:41,611 --> 01:40:43,500
Yeah.
To get it to where it's easy.

1818
01:40:43,620 --> 01:40:47,160
I just can't imagine drawing without
an eraser for a tattoo artist.

1819
01:40:47,161 --> 01:40:49,710
That's just seems to me like
the scariest thing in the road.

1820
01:40:49,711 --> 01:40:53,860
Cause I've never drawn something that I
didn't erase something on or change or

1821
01:40:53,861 --> 01:40:54,070
wish

1822
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:58,210
I did something different. And it is, it
is. There are times when you're tattooing.

1823
01:40:58,211 --> 01:41:00,910
I'm like, Shit, I have to
now work around this. Well,

1824
01:41:00,911 --> 01:41:03,550
you also got to think about the time
you're putting in as opposed to time she's

1825
01:41:03,551 --> 01:41:06,460
putting it. Yeah, I mean she's doing like,
you know, you probably tattooing eight,

1826
01:41:06,461 --> 01:41:08,500
10 hours a day, right? How many
hours a day you're doing this?

1827
01:41:08,670 --> 01:41:13,050
Oh, nowadays? Or were you when you
started? Oh yeah. I mean it was so,

1828
01:41:13,110 --> 01:41:17,640
so many hours. I never, I didn't have
a day off until my first days off.

1829
01:41:17,730 --> 01:41:21,510
I started like three or four years
ago I started taking Sundays off. Wow.

1830
01:41:21,620 --> 01:41:25,130
Did you ever have any idea that you
could have some sort of reality show type

1831
01:41:25,131 --> 01:41:27,590
success? Like Watch TV? I mean,

1832
01:41:27,591 --> 01:41:30,350
but was there any idea that you could
have this kind of success? I mean,

1833
01:41:30,351 --> 01:41:33,390
did you ever think that, did you
have this in your head that you would

1834
01:41:34,220 --> 01:41:38,300
see like things in the like, I see things
differently. Some are, I don't know,

1835
01:41:38,301 --> 01:41:40,520
I just see things like, uh, like, oh,

1836
01:41:40,521 --> 01:41:43,310
there's an opportunity or oh that you
can make this out of that. You know,

1837
01:41:43,311 --> 01:41:46,280
and I think a lot of people, maybe
you're just blind themselves to that.

1838
01:41:46,281 --> 01:41:49,880
So I don't know. I never wanted
that. It's not, I actually was,

1839
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:51,230
but it didn't exist before.

1840
01:41:51,680 --> 01:41:54,350
Well, it didn't exist. Celebrity
tattooist didn't exist.

1841
01:41:54,530 --> 01:41:58,260
I mean the ED hardy type dudes.
There was a few names. Yeah.

1842
01:41:59,110 --> 01:42:01,140
The polls. I never in a
million years imagined. Yeah.

1843
01:42:01,200 --> 01:42:03,090
The staff. I mean if you knew
like where I was born in,

1844
01:42:03,091 --> 01:42:05,460
how would you know where I come from?

1845
01:42:05,461 --> 01:42:08,550
It's like totally different than it's
the opposite of this stuff, you know?

1846
01:42:08,551 --> 01:42:12,240
But I don't know. It's not, I dunno,
I'm not that impressed by that stuff.

1847
01:42:12,241 --> 01:42:15,450
It's cool. It's cool and I'm very
appreciative. It's like awesome. Like, Oh,

1848
01:42:15,451 --> 01:42:17,100
I get to do more of this
stuff, you know? But

1849
01:42:17,410 --> 01:42:20,770
well, when I talk about it and I'm not
saying it in terms of like your, your,

1850
01:42:20,771 --> 01:42:25,700
your common perception of how people view
success and look at her, she's on TV.

1851
01:42:25,701 --> 01:42:26,620
Yeah.
It's not that.

1852
01:42:26,621 --> 01:42:31,570
What I mean is how receptive people
are and how much resonance your work is

1853
01:42:31,571 --> 01:42:33,220
having on people.
Never in a million years.

1854
01:42:34,160 --> 01:42:38,050
Yeah. I mean, I was like, you know, like
that's like the weird girl here, whatever,

1855
01:42:38,060 --> 01:42:39,890
you know, like the fact that, oh,

1856
01:42:40,140 --> 01:42:42,080
maybe that's why I'm bad
at compliments and stuff.

1857
01:42:42,081 --> 01:42:46,430
So he knows and it's like I'm
just not used to that still. Yeah,

1858
01:42:46,431 --> 01:42:49,670
that's gotta be kind of
awkward. Right. But it's a,

1859
01:42:49,671 --> 01:42:51,790
it's a really fascinating but not done.

1860
01:42:51,860 --> 01:42:55,500
But now that I'm not like how he
thinks I used to be, I guess it's like,

1861
01:42:56,360 --> 01:43:00,110
yeah. Oh, that's when you were
hotter back then. Oh, see dude,

1862
01:43:00,111 --> 01:43:03,490
I told you she's still riding on that.
We let that Joe,

1863
01:43:03,710 --> 01:43:05,450
we let that joke fly over our hands,

1864
01:43:05,451 --> 01:43:10,451
but she's still holding on to way like
a hot lava rock and her arms burning or

1865
01:43:10,761 --> 01:43:15,020
soul. Oh, no way. No Way. By the way, look
how beautiful her shoes look today. Joe W,

1866
01:43:15,050 --> 01:43:16,550
why do you like shoes or something?
Because I'm just kidding.

1867
01:43:16,760 --> 01:43:21,410
I sort of came from Disneyland, so
I'm like, cool. There's such a stigma.

1868
01:43:21,440 --> 01:43:26,120
Even I'm guilty of that too.
I like shoes or something.
No. Oh No. Oh, I'm not a fan.

1869
01:43:26,121 --> 01:43:29,570
I love shoes. I'm a normal guy.
Usually. Usually. Look growing up,

1870
01:43:29,870 --> 01:43:33,950
you think tattoos? Like
for me, tattoos. Look,

1871
01:43:33,951 --> 01:43:37,910
my uncles had tattoos that, you
know, I'm sure that influenced me.

1872
01:43:38,300 --> 01:43:43,130
But you know, generally girls that got
tattoos, they generally weren't hot.

1873
01:43:43,480 --> 01:43:45,110
Right? Generally. Yeah.

1874
01:43:45,260 --> 01:43:49,200
And I can imagine the,
the,

1875
01:43:49,510 --> 01:43:52,160
the amount of guys who
thought like, damn, she's

1876
01:43:52,160 --> 01:43:55,580
so hot, she's ruining herself with
the tattoos or something. And,

1877
01:43:55,700 --> 01:43:57,350
and now look at her now.
You know what I mean?

1878
01:43:57,560 --> 01:44:02,060
Most guys wouldn't think that though.
An illusion that girls have. I think,

1879
01:44:02,270 --> 01:44:02,840
you know,

1880
01:44:02,840 --> 01:44:06,980
most guys you'd be amazed at how little
we give a fuck about like a lot of shit

1881
01:44:06,981 --> 01:44:09,050
that you have more different generation.

1882
01:44:09,051 --> 01:44:10,700
That's all you guys
were in the body shape.

1883
01:44:10,730 --> 01:44:14,060
You change the perception single handedly
though. Oh yeah. Without a doubt.

1884
01:44:14,061 --> 01:44:16,790
You'd definitely threw a monkey wrench
into the whole idea of what's hot.

1885
01:44:17,030 --> 01:44:19,280
And there was,
there was one movie which he took a deep,

1886
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:23,360
there was a movie with Will Ferrell, I
think it wasn't like a, an extreme comedy,

1887
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:26,900
but the love interest and they never
really addressed it in the movie had a

1888
01:44:26,901 --> 01:44:28,560
sleeve,
you know what I'm talking about right?

1889
01:44:28,600 --> 01:44:30,590
The love interest had a sleeve and
I think it was fake or whatever,

1890
01:44:30,591 --> 01:44:31,640
but they never talked about it.

1891
01:44:31,790 --> 01:44:35,090
She was just a chick who worked at a
bakery and will Ferrell. I think that's,

1892
01:44:35,091 --> 01:44:38,840
it was like fell in love with her
or whatever and that never existed.

1893
01:44:39,080 --> 01:44:40,220
Yeah.
And all the movie offers,

1894
01:44:40,221 --> 01:44:44,810
I haven't ever gotten her like a
hooker drug dealer of an player.

1895
01:44:45,500 --> 01:44:50,150
What else? Zombie random goth chick.
Uh, other, yeah. It's never club scene.

1896
01:44:50,180 --> 01:44:53,300
The Queue. It's will Ferrell
or whatever. That's funny.

1897
01:44:54,120 --> 01:44:54,570
Yeah.

1898
01:44:54,570 --> 01:44:59,570
It's weird how the perception of what
tattoos are over the last couple of

1899
01:44:59,730 --> 01:45:03,020
decades. But like when I was
a kid, no one had sleeves. My,

1900
01:45:03,040 --> 01:45:07,260
my friend's Dad's never had sleeves,
you know, that's weird. But then,

1901
01:45:07,680 --> 01:45:11,540
you know, uh, today it's so
common. It's, I mean, what are the,

1902
01:45:11,880 --> 01:45:15,750
how much more common is our tattoos
today then when we were kids,

1903
01:45:16,980 --> 01:45:19,630
she is huge and you got to
talk into the thing, man.

1904
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:23,220
Victor are really good friends.
A friend of ours has a son,

1905
01:45:23,370 --> 01:45:26,550
his name is Tori and Victor has sleeps.

1906
01:45:26,610 --> 01:45:29,340
He has a lot of tattoos and
his son is 11 or 12 now.

1907
01:45:29,670 --> 01:45:33,450
And the last time I hung out with him
his son was drawing on himself for the

1908
01:45:33,451 --> 01:45:35,160
whole night.
He had like just marked,

1909
01:45:35,280 --> 01:45:37,800
it felt like really cool
cause he was like his dad.

1910
01:45:38,010 --> 01:45:39,330
So that would be a key for sure.

1911
01:45:39,330 --> 01:45:41,880
He's going to get tapped days that
it just seems like he is. Yeah.

1912
01:45:42,540 --> 01:45:45,210
Kids are always more open minded and
stuff cause they're not like painted by

1913
01:45:45,211 --> 01:45:49,290
like he would get the tattoos because
he thought it was cool cause his dad,

1914
01:45:49,291 --> 01:45:51,960
cause him and his dad have an amazing
relationship. There's, there's,

1915
01:45:52,260 --> 01:45:56,220
there's no lack of love in that kid's
life. Yeah. So you know, I'm just kidding.

1916
01:45:56,490 --> 01:46:00,360
Oh no shit. She just hit you with
the real son. It is true though. His,

1917
01:46:00,361 --> 01:46:04,250
his dad's awesome. Oh
yeah, Victor's got, yeah.

1918
01:46:04,740 --> 01:46:09,090
Yeah that kid. Probably mom. It's a weird
rite of passage thing too for young man.

1919
01:46:09,270 --> 01:46:12,020
It's like when some young kids want
to smoke and there's, you know,

1920
01:46:12,030 --> 01:46:13,050
they're not around their parents.

1921
01:46:13,051 --> 01:46:15,060
They want to have that cigarette
so he can pretend to be an adult.

1922
01:46:15,630 --> 01:46:19,050
They have friends that smoke, like
older friends or something. Yeah.

1923
01:46:19,051 --> 01:46:21,900
That or if they see their parents do
it and they sneak them out and they get

1924
01:46:21,901 --> 01:46:25,650
them together, you know, that's what I did
when I was a kid. We'd sneak out booze,

1925
01:46:25,710 --> 01:46:27,930
saw our parents drinking
so it's fine booze,

1926
01:46:27,950 --> 01:46:31,510
my parents' house and sneaking out into
the woods and we would do it cause we

1927
01:46:31,530 --> 01:46:33,030
pretend to be like adults,
you know,

1928
01:46:33,050 --> 01:46:37,320
installing really like we wanted to get
drunk. We're only gonna like 11 you know,

1929
01:46:37,860 --> 01:46:42,480
the like, you know, kids do
that. They, they, they, the
hell is wrong with me, man.

1930
01:46:42,481 --> 01:46:44,130
My parents were so square and like,

1931
01:46:44,960 --> 01:46:48,270
it sounds like your parents are just super
disciplined. Where did I get it from?

1932
01:46:48,940 --> 01:46:50,040
Miami.
It's just a reaction

1933
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:53,200
to that. The fact that you had to
practice all the time and you were very,

1934
01:46:53,201 --> 01:46:56,730
very regimented and disciplined and,
and you just became a,

1935
01:46:56,731 --> 01:47:01,350
a wild sort of thing because of that,
because of the fact that you were right.

1936
01:47:01,590 --> 01:47:05,160
So a boxed in by a rigid sort of,

1937
01:47:05,230 --> 01:47:09,230
but it wasn't wild. I mean, no, I looked
crazy, but I was, I just loved punk rock.

1938
01:47:09,320 --> 01:47:11,930
It's probably just music then
Flint and music. I think it was,

1939
01:47:12,140 --> 01:47:14,450
it was like there's something,
there's more out there. Yeah.

1940
01:47:14,451 --> 01:47:16,940
If you're totally into punk,
you're going to get some tattoos.

1941
01:47:17,150 --> 01:47:19,400
Eventually you're going to get
something, something. Yeah.

1942
01:47:19,460 --> 01:47:20,750
If you're really into punk,

1943
01:47:20,780 --> 01:47:23,990
that black flag thing you might
get that's barely got those bars.

1944
01:47:24,680 --> 01:47:28,970
Like last month I was like,
can't believe I haven't black flag bars.

1945
01:47:29,290 --> 01:47:33,440
They'll really just got
them all. That's cool. Yeah.
That's, you're like, oh my God,

1946
01:47:33,441 --> 01:47:36,770
I forgot that one shit. No, it's
like, how did I not have that already?

1947
01:47:37,140 --> 01:47:41,070
Do you, uh, I mean you said he covered
up some that were under your left arm.

1948
01:47:41,250 --> 01:47:43,100
Are you done covering own
or do you look at your own

1949
01:47:43,490 --> 01:47:44,780
look? A few that like, oh,

1950
01:47:44,781 --> 01:47:48,260
I have one on my leg that I
started lasering would hurt
so much analysis. I just,

1951
01:47:48,510 --> 01:47:51,870
again, time consumption. It's harder
for me to get tattooed cause I'm busy.

1952
01:47:51,871 --> 01:47:55,620
They're doing them or doing all the
other stuff I do. So it's like, but yeah,

1953
01:47:55,621 --> 01:47:58,020
there's a few. I think I would, I mean,

1954
01:47:58,021 --> 01:48:01,500
just for the sake of making more
room or something like, yeah,

1955
01:48:01,510 --> 01:48:05,130
like isn't that crazy though? Maybe just
spend, doctors will become popular again.

1956
01:48:06,230 --> 01:48:06,810
Do you have any

1957
01:48:06,810 --> 01:48:09,900
bands are just like totally
whacked at a tattooed on, you know,

1958
01:48:09,901 --> 01:48:11,190
I only listen to rap music,

1959
01:48:11,191 --> 01:48:13,260
but I mean at one point in time
you loved them and now you're like,

1960
01:48:13,730 --> 01:48:17,130
I can't blame a tattooed those guys on me.
I think I've always liked rap music.

1961
01:48:17,870 --> 01:48:21,180
Always been cool.
You've always had good taste.

1962
01:48:21,390 --> 01:48:23,970
So with the ones that you were,
you're thinking about laser and off,

1963
01:48:23,971 --> 01:48:25,890
you just have some ideas that
you need some space for it.

1964
01:48:26,070 --> 01:48:28,770
No, I mean, and there's just some
that like, I, I don't have regrets.

1965
01:48:28,780 --> 01:48:33,270
I can live with him or without him, you
know? But I think like, I, it's not,

1966
01:48:33,271 --> 01:48:37,350
I don't know, like I haven't had that many
boyfriends in my entire life, you know,

1967
01:48:37,380 --> 01:48:41,080
cause I'm always the
cue that Violin Violet,

1968
01:48:41,590 --> 01:48:44,130
I'm just saying that know you got to
be quicker with that, Brian. Yeah.

1969
01:48:44,140 --> 01:48:48,630
You gotta be ready with
those on that's terrible. No,

1970
01:48:48,690 --> 01:48:53,690
but like I've gotten tattoos for
maybe the whole community walk away.

1971
01:48:54,780 --> 01:48:57,120
Oh, that's what it was.
Well that's a terrible,

1972
01:49:00,870 --> 01:49:03,750
you know the end of the, yeah.
Sorry, I'm just hearing you guys,

1973
01:49:03,840 --> 01:49:05,400
I'm sorry this is so you don't have,

1974
01:49:05,430 --> 01:49:08,160
you haven't had that many boyfriends
and I mean I think I've gotten like some

1975
01:49:08,161 --> 01:49:11,910
tattoos for um,
whatever those relationships in Pasadena.

1976
01:49:12,150 --> 01:49:14,850
Like my first tattoo was a j and
whatever and I still love it,

1977
01:49:14,851 --> 01:49:18,810
but I think there's like two portraits
I'd like to get lasered off you.

1978
01:49:18,811 --> 01:49:22,170
It seems like for you, I
mean, correct me if I'm wrong,

1979
01:49:22,900 --> 01:49:27,870
but it seems like
at least if I had to guess,

1980
01:49:28,690 --> 01:49:32,950
it's probably very difficult for you to
enter into a relationship because you

1981
01:49:32,951 --> 01:49:35,590
seem to be like one of
those all in sort of girls.

1982
01:49:35,860 --> 01:49:39,130
Like you fall in love with someone
and yeah. All or nothing. Yeah. Yeah.

1983
01:49:39,160 --> 01:49:44,140
So you're ready right away, all an all
or nothing and then it doesn't work.

1984
01:49:44,141 --> 01:49:47,980
It's nothing. And then just like, it's
hard to make that. It's hard to pull that

1985
01:49:47,980 --> 01:49:49,480
trigger. We, what do you mean?

1986
01:49:49,481 --> 01:49:52,150
What score would you pull that all
or nothing trigger? I don't know.

1987
01:49:52,151 --> 01:49:56,110
Any other way. That's what I'm saying.
I mean it seems that that's your style.

1988
01:49:56,111 --> 01:50:00,640
Your, yeah. Is that bad? No, no
it's, but it's hard. It's not bad.

1989
01:50:00,700 --> 01:50:01,780
Which cause you look,

1990
01:50:01,990 --> 01:50:06,700
if you find her to make a connection
with people that are like true or true to

1991
01:50:06,701 --> 01:50:09,460
themselves and see like most of
the time people when you meet them,

1992
01:50:09,730 --> 01:50:10,720
they're putting,
uh,

1993
01:50:10,830 --> 01:50:14,290
like putting out like a perception of
themselves is how they would like to be

1994
01:50:14,291 --> 01:50:14,621
seen.

1995
01:50:14,621 --> 01:50:18,130
So you're already going through like two
layers right there of what the person

1996
01:50:18,131 --> 01:50:22,960
really is. Or sometimes it might even be
bullshitting themselves. Yeah. So like,

1997
01:50:23,560 --> 01:50:27,320
whereas I'm not by any means perfect,
but I pretty much like I talk a lot,

1998
01:50:27,330 --> 01:50:28,920
I've talked about the
same stuff. Like, oh,

1999
01:50:29,050 --> 01:50:31,220
this is the same conversation I'd
have with like my homie. It's like,

2000
01:50:31,300 --> 01:50:33,220
you know what I mean? Like it's kind of
what you see is what you get, you know?

2001
01:50:33,221 --> 01:50:36,130
And I've only met very few
people that are that way. And,

2002
01:50:36,220 --> 01:50:40,300
and so I think that oftentimes you've
tend to fall in love with this perception

2003
01:50:40,301 --> 01:50:44,620
versus the person. And so in my case,
sometimes I feel like it's all, it's,

2004
01:50:44,621 --> 01:50:46,300
it tends to be intense in the beginnings.

2005
01:50:46,540 --> 01:50:50,380
And then I'm good tenure being on fire
and then maybe it's not so much that way,

2006
01:50:50,381 --> 01:50:54,100
but I'm also a very emotional person.
I'm gonna be like very, you know,

2007
01:50:54,440 --> 01:50:55,700
till the bitter end.
Well,

2008
01:50:55,701 --> 01:50:58,970
sometimes people can bullshit you for
quite a long time before you really get

2009
01:50:58,971 --> 01:51:01,100
used to what they're really
like. Yeah, yeah. Totally.

2010
01:51:01,110 --> 01:51:03,300
Three or four months in you like three,

2011
01:51:03,320 --> 01:51:07,220
four minutes is so short of a time of
day. It is a short amount of time. Yeah,

2012
01:51:07,250 --> 01:51:07,910
it is.

2013
01:51:07,910 --> 01:51:10,880
But you could find out everything about
someone and three or four months of

2014
01:51:10,881 --> 01:51:14,150
constantly being with them, they can
only hide their character for so long,

2015
01:51:14,300 --> 01:51:17,600
which is I think, but I always wonder
about like, dudes like Paul Mccartney,

2016
01:51:18,020 --> 01:51:19,610
Paul Mccartney is a bad motherfucker.

2017
01:51:19,730 --> 01:51:22,430
But then you'd hear that ex
wife talk about m. And. T.

2018
01:51:22,460 --> 01:51:25,160
You ever heard of the one the woman
who had lost her leg in a motorcycle

2019
01:51:25,161 --> 01:51:28,550
accident? No. Cheese demonic. I mean,

2020
01:51:28,580 --> 01:51:32,330
the way that lady would talk about Paul
Mccartney was like the most terrifying

2021
01:51:32,331 --> 01:51:35,690
thing. Like it was just, she's ridiculous.
I don't want to hear about that stuff.

2022
01:51:35,720 --> 01:51:39,110
Yeah, you don't want to hear it. You
super negative. I want to hear, well,

2023
01:51:39,320 --> 01:51:41,320
super negative about if
anything ever happened to her.

2024
01:51:41,330 --> 01:51:44,000
She has information hidden
secret places about him.

2025
01:51:44,001 --> 01:51:45,680
I'm doing the best to protect my husband.

2026
01:51:45,681 --> 01:51:50,390
She was like just a crazy evil person and
wanted stacks of cash from him and his

2027
01:51:50,391 --> 01:51:53,600
dumb ass didn't get a prenuptial and he
got roped in by a woman pretending to be

2028
01:51:53,601 --> 01:51:55,580
something she wasn't.
And then once he had a kid with her,

2029
01:51:55,581 --> 01:51:59,870
she just turned on the hooks and fucking
ripped her chest open and a monster

2030
01:51:59,871 --> 01:52:02,540
flew out. And that was her. And
that was all the interviews.

2031
01:52:02,541 --> 01:52:04,340
After that you would listen
to the interviews and you go,

2032
01:52:04,341 --> 01:52:06,170
how did he not see this common man?

2033
01:52:06,350 --> 01:52:08,970
How do they not know that he
was with a crazy person of this

2034
01:52:09,110 --> 01:52:13,090
does you want to believe
in? I think people's ability
to be something, you know?

2035
01:52:13,200 --> 01:52:18,060
Yeah, for sure. Also, he came
out of a longterm relationship
with Linda Mccartney,

2036
01:52:18,061 --> 01:52:21,090
who was supposed to be an amazing person,
like really nice sweet woman.

2037
01:52:21,450 --> 01:52:23,130
By all accounts they got along great.

2038
01:52:23,310 --> 01:52:25,920
So he's probably his ideas of
what relationships were like.

2039
01:52:25,921 --> 01:52:27,990
He really thought that's what you
did. You know, you find someone,

2040
01:52:27,991 --> 01:52:29,400
you just nice to them,
they're nice to you.

2041
01:52:29,580 --> 01:52:30,900
And this is just the way she really is.

2042
01:52:31,020 --> 01:52:33,500
He didn't even look for
all the clues of credit

2043
01:52:33,620 --> 01:52:36,170
maybe. I mean, who knows? You know
what I mean? I always think it's like,

2044
01:52:36,171 --> 01:52:38,740
unless you're in it, you're really
don't know what's going on, you know?

2045
01:52:39,160 --> 01:52:42,370
Right. That's why you speculate it's
fun and he talk shit at the same time.

2046
01:52:42,400 --> 01:52:43,000
It's great.

2047
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:46,910
It's good times speculating and talking
Shit and how Paul Mccartney got roped in.

2048
01:52:47,850 --> 01:52:51,100
Yeah, I dunno. So you haven't had that
many boyfriends because of that because,

2049
01:52:51,220 --> 01:52:52,620
no, no, no, no. I know.

2050
01:52:52,630 --> 01:52:55,270
I think I haven't had that many boys
cause I'm always in longterm relationships

2051
01:52:55,271 --> 01:52:59,500
I think is what it is. He's like,
so you haven't had any boyfriends.

2052
01:53:01,120 --> 01:53:05,430
Damn man. You make me feel creepy.
What did he come up with that?

2053
01:53:06,900 --> 01:53:11,570
Thank you Brian. Thanks for
[inaudible] but no, no. Anyway, so

2054
01:53:16,020 --> 01:53:18,100
go get it.
Come on or tattoo again.

2055
01:53:18,310 --> 01:53:21,640
It's really important story
ever been to the off guard

2056
01:53:24,530 --> 01:53:28,790
most ridiculous shit ever. Yeah, I
don't know. Yeah, love is a funny thing.

2057
01:53:28,850 --> 01:53:31,670
It's hard as fuck, but you got to find
the right person. That's what it is.

2058
01:53:31,671 --> 01:53:34,760
I mean the right person for you might
not be the right person for somebody else

2059
01:53:34,940 --> 01:53:39,140
and finding that perfect
interaction with people.

2060
01:53:39,440 --> 01:53:42,260
It's almost impossible. It's so
hard. It's so hard to line up,

2061
01:53:42,500 --> 01:53:43,730
especially for a chick like you know,

2062
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:47,330
because you have to have some like
some serious bad motherfucker.

2063
01:53:47,420 --> 01:53:50,590
You can't just have like some
regular tude pretty good.

2064
01:53:50,950 --> 01:53:52,160
The heart related to be honest,

2065
01:53:52,940 --> 01:53:56,700
when it comes to like the amount of like
solidness that I, that I guess every,

2066
01:53:56,980 --> 01:54:01,550
yeah, but for a dude to not be tweaked
by you being all hot and famous,

2067
01:54:01,610 --> 01:54:05,180
covered in tattoos and all wild,
crazy famous tattoo lasers.

2068
01:54:05,181 --> 01:54:08,360
That's a serious obstacle.
Like a Braveheart dude,

2069
01:54:09,230 --> 01:54:13,160
some Mallory warrior,
he's like,

2070
01:54:13,161 --> 01:54:18,080
it's just seems like I would just
want to be with somebody who,

2071
01:54:18,260 --> 01:54:21,890
who can get it, you know, and like I
could relate to or understand, you know,

2072
01:54:21,891 --> 01:54:23,840
Chubby as a comic or something.

2073
01:54:24,740 --> 01:54:28,110
He's putting himself out there.
That's what he's doing. My creepiness.

2074
01:54:29,900 --> 01:54:30,990
I like intelligence.

2075
01:54:31,860 --> 01:54:34,770
Jennifer Lopez,
she's doomed to a life of Betas.

2076
01:54:34,980 --> 01:54:38,370
She's going to have to date these Beta
men and buy them cars and there'll be

2077
01:54:38,371 --> 01:54:40,560
younger than her and that's it.
That's just the way it goes from now on.

2078
01:54:40,830 --> 01:54:44,970
This is no, it should be a batter
motherfucker than Jennifer Lopez.

2079
01:54:45,780 --> 01:54:49,500
Good luck. Good luck feller. Who the fuck
is, it was like, this is what you got.

2080
01:54:49,501 --> 01:54:52,060
Like Brad Pitt and a couple other dudes.
The only people who can data.

2081
01:54:52,260 --> 01:54:56,130
Her dating pool is down to
like five people and most
of them are married already.

2082
01:54:56,370 --> 01:54:59,280
It's like good luck, but she'll,
she's got to go the other way.

2083
01:54:59,520 --> 01:55:01,020
I think you're going to have
to have gone that way too.

2084
01:55:01,170 --> 01:55:04,080
You're going to have to get some
Beta, his man, servant type dudes.

2085
01:55:06,710 --> 01:55:09,160
I'm telling you. That's what I want
to bring Brian into. Your Life.

2086
01:55:10,070 --> 01:55:14,050
Shit will be perfect. Would
worship you. He would set up,

2087
01:55:14,200 --> 01:55:16,790
set up your website.
It said

2088
01:55:20,890 --> 01:55:23,880
he could really spice up your
Twitter background. Right.

2089
01:55:25,030 --> 01:55:26,170
Can Make Shit happen.

2090
01:55:28,180 --> 01:55:33,040
Yeah, I, I dunno. That's funny.
Shit. Hey, it's, it's the
fucking, that's the big mean.

2091
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:38,020
If there was one dilemma that people
find in life that's most prevalent in our

2092
01:55:38,021 --> 01:55:39,970
society,
it's finding the right person.

2093
01:55:40,330 --> 01:55:43,470
It's like probably the biggest dilemma
that anybody ever faces when you're

2094
01:55:43,471 --> 01:55:43,980
growing up.

2095
01:55:43,980 --> 01:55:46,320
Especially me. You're always like, man,

2096
01:55:46,321 --> 01:55:49,170
if I could just find the right girl
if I give is find the right guy for

2097
01:55:49,171 --> 01:55:50,970
everybody.
That's like the number one.

2098
01:55:51,920 --> 01:55:56,640
It's hard. It's like working on
yourself first and then they,

2099
01:55:56,670 --> 01:55:58,320
then you put yourself in a position,
you know what I mean?

2100
01:55:58,321 --> 01:56:00,660
Because I know that like in
the past where, you know,

2101
01:56:00,661 --> 01:56:03,270
it's kind of like the hippie stuff we
talked about earlier. It's like, you know,

2102
01:56:03,271 --> 01:56:08,010
water seeking its own level.
And um, I feel like, like I
look back at like my last,

2103
01:56:08,400 --> 01:56:12,440
you know, the relationship
that was an an an awful mass.

2104
01:56:12,441 --> 01:56:15,540
It's like a part of me feels like,
oh my God, I got duped or something.

2105
01:56:15,541 --> 01:56:19,860
But then another part of me is like,
I created this to a certain degree too.

2106
01:56:19,861 --> 01:56:21,780
If it's like, if, if there's like,

2107
01:56:22,080 --> 01:56:25,920
there's red flags that I failed to see
because I wanted to believe that it was

2108
01:56:25,921 --> 01:56:28,500
something else. I know people do that
all the time, so it's more like, okay,

2109
01:56:28,501 --> 01:56:32,010
well w at the end of the day, like, what's
wrong with me? You know what I mean?

2110
01:56:32,011 --> 01:56:35,550
Like what, what was my part in it? What
could I have done to not, you know,

2111
01:56:35,551 --> 01:56:38,820
obviously that does not discredit
people's like shitty behavior. You know,

2112
01:56:38,821 --> 01:56:40,740
obviously some people suck and stuff.

2113
01:56:40,741 --> 01:56:44,340
And some people are really good liars
and whatever, but like I think, uh,

2114
01:56:44,560 --> 01:56:46,480
do you have to grow as well?

2115
01:56:47,180 --> 01:56:47,721
Yeah,
I think it's,

2116
01:56:47,721 --> 01:56:50,270
I think it's more important to put
yourself in a situation where you can be

2117
01:56:50,271 --> 01:56:52,640
receptive to a healthy
relationship. Like, you know,

2118
01:56:52,670 --> 01:56:56,450
when I was depressed I like kind of
gravitated towards other people that were

2119
01:56:56,451 --> 01:56:59,150
also sad and, and that doesn't
help. You know what I mean?

2120
01:56:59,151 --> 01:57:03,620
So I think as far as like what you're
saying is like finding somebody at a level

2121
01:57:03,621 --> 01:57:06,060
or whatever. Yeah, there's that Nice
understandability like, you know,

2122
01:57:06,080 --> 01:57:10,580
I can talk about things that bug me that
may not bug like a regular person or

2123
01:57:10,581 --> 01:57:13,670
whatever, but it's more like the
connection of the mind, you know?

2124
01:57:13,671 --> 01:57:16,940
I want to be inspired by somebody who
is equally as driven and equally like

2125
01:57:16,941 --> 01:57:20,270
wanting to create and like
that shit drives me crazy.

2126
01:57:20,271 --> 01:57:24,140
Like when someone's into it, you know,
whether you're a busboy or fucking famous.

2127
01:57:24,170 --> 01:57:26,830
Yeah. What I'm saying is you're fucked.
You're never going to find a dude. Like,

2128
01:57:27,560 --> 01:57:30,460
I read poetry and then why
do you think it's better?

2129
01:57:30,470 --> 01:57:33,260
That crazy thing is I said
the c word earlier, Jesus,

2130
01:57:34,610 --> 01:57:36,680
anybody dating like a Jessica Alba,

2131
01:57:36,890 --> 01:57:40,580
that dude has to deal with the fact that
she's really good friends with a lot of

2132
01:57:40,610 --> 01:57:43,350
a list celebrities. Right. So
that's what you want to throw a gun.

2133
01:57:43,790 --> 01:57:46,640
This is the Siberia thing cause it's
like all those things are mentally

2134
01:57:46,641 --> 01:57:50,440
generated ideas of what's important
or what's good. Like, like,

2135
01:57:50,490 --> 01:57:52,850
like I don't see it that way.
You know what I mean?

2136
01:57:52,851 --> 01:57:56,540
Like I'm not saying I could
fall in love with, with anybody,

2137
01:57:56,541 --> 01:58:00,650
but like if it fits your mind or your
soul, whatever you want to call it,

2138
01:58:00,651 --> 01:58:05,600
like I could fall in love with that. It
really does not have to do with um, what,

2139
01:58:05,610 --> 01:58:07,330
what the world's perception of you is.
Yeah.

2140
01:58:07,400 --> 01:58:08,211
Yeah.
You say that,

2141
01:58:08,211 --> 01:58:10,550
but you got to find out how much
the gardener makes and was like,

2142
01:58:10,670 --> 01:58:12,020
bitch can't even take me out to do

2143
01:58:13,070 --> 01:58:16,290
than shit we got going on here.
It's not that way.

2144
01:58:16,360 --> 01:58:21,140
It like is she with dudes paying
for my stuff? Do you really? Yeah,

2145
01:58:21,141 --> 01:58:25,310
I think it's probably because I was my
own set of issues is like, you know,

2146
01:58:25,311 --> 01:58:28,880
I'm not a feminist or like I don't
consider myself anything but like I think,

2147
01:58:29,660 --> 01:58:32,330
you know, just growing up poor, I'm
always like, oh, I can do it myself.

2148
01:58:32,370 --> 01:58:36,590
Don't write a door for me. Like,
yeah, no, that makes sense.

2149
01:58:37,010 --> 01:58:40,880
I would hate to be a girl and have dudes
buy me dinner and then expect something

2150
01:58:40,881 --> 01:58:41,750
from,
no,

2151
01:58:42,010 --> 01:58:46,240
it's a sincere gift. Is it a
difference? You know? But I
also like, um, I don't know.

2152
01:58:46,750 --> 01:58:49,120
Yeah,
you got to be single for a long time.

2153
01:58:49,121 --> 01:58:53,330
Kid stuck in a workout downer.
Damn,

2154
01:58:55,300 --> 01:58:58,180
you're too much of a bad motherfucker.
It's really going to be hard.

2155
01:59:00,370 --> 01:59:04,930
Rock star friends, she's like really good.
Close to, yeah, you get those guys alone.

2156
01:59:04,931 --> 01:59:08,140
They all fall apart.
But

2157
01:59:09,720 --> 01:59:12,430
that would intimidate some
guys. Guys would be like, damn,

2158
01:59:12,820 --> 01:59:16,240
she's best friends with him. Him hitting
her, you know? That would be the most,

2159
01:59:16,241 --> 01:59:17,160
one of the saddest things,

2160
01:59:17,170 --> 01:59:19,990
if you look really into a rock star and
then you started dating him when he was

2161
01:59:19,991 --> 01:59:24,730
just a whiny bitch, you'd be like,
really, man, you stopped liking the music.

2162
01:59:24,740 --> 01:59:26,490
Your fucking music was awesome.

2163
01:59:26,680 --> 01:59:29,770
Imagine if you started dating Mick
Jagger just found out he's a cunt.

2164
01:59:30,160 --> 01:59:33,640
Just Mick Jagger's off fucking
dumb con. You're like, what?

2165
01:59:34,090 --> 01:59:38,880
God dammit. That has to be the hardest
for a girl. Did a rockstar fighter.

2166
01:59:38,950 --> 01:59:43,590
He's a Dork. That would be the hardest
shit ever. But the Rock Mick Jagger,

2167
01:59:43,840 --> 01:59:48,370
that would crush the rock star.
Fuck yeah. Yeah. Wow. Yeah,

2168
01:59:48,380 --> 01:59:52,390
that'd be devastating. Rockstars don't
get broken up with. They do though.

2169
01:59:52,420 --> 01:59:55,730
They get dumped, especially
in this day and age. You know,

2170
01:59:55,750 --> 01:59:59,140
I think in the protected days of the
60s and the 70s like I've read some shit

2171
01:59:59,141 --> 01:59:59,951
about Hendrix,
man.

2172
01:59:59,951 --> 02:00:03,790
I got so bummed out because I'm a huge
Hendrix fan and I was reading an expert,

2173
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:07,330
expert excerpt from this,
a book about him,

2174
02:00:07,690 --> 02:00:10,420
and one of them was like about Jimmy
Hendrix beating the shit out of his

2175
02:00:10,421 --> 02:00:14,370
girlfriend. They're like, Jimi Hendrix
would just smack around. We weren't there.

2176
02:00:14,380 --> 02:00:18,520
That's the thing. It's true. You're right.
Standing up for women beaters. I like it.

2177
02:00:19,220 --> 02:00:23,960
[inaudible]
Jamie kills teen.

2178
02:00:26,050 --> 02:00:29,590
No, no, you're absolutely right.
You're the guy was a band member.

2179
02:00:29,591 --> 02:00:30,880
He could have been a jealous bitch.

2180
02:00:31,030 --> 02:00:36,030
He's the guys in the band with one
of the greatest [inaudible] beating.

2181
02:00:36,501 --> 02:00:40,450
It just cleans. That's what he
likes. Lassen is coffee. No,

2182
02:00:40,570 --> 02:00:44,980
but I mean who knows what really happened.
But reading about that, it was like,

2183
02:00:44,981 --> 02:00:45,251
wow,

2184
02:00:45,251 --> 02:00:49,120
that's so like you read like some tweets
that like Chris Brown makes and these

2185
02:00:49,360 --> 02:00:50,500
fucking moron.

2186
02:00:50,501 --> 02:00:53,050
He makes these tweets and everybody
hates them and to go after him.

2187
02:00:53,051 --> 02:00:57,100
Then he deletes these tweets. What does
he say? Just really stupid shit about,

2188
02:00:57,310 --> 02:00:59,320
oh he's, you know, after
the whole Rihanna thing,

2189
02:00:59,321 --> 02:01:03,160
he would like get in arguments with
people about him beating up women and they

2190
02:01:03,161 --> 02:01:04,450
were, they were like,
really? He's a moron.

2191
02:01:04,451 --> 02:01:08,470
So there were like really gross
kind of tweets. But this, this,

2192
02:01:08,500 --> 02:01:12,670
that didn't exist. Like in
the, the led Zeppelin days,

2193
02:01:13,100 --> 02:01:14,050
there was no Twitter.

2194
02:01:15,810 --> 02:01:18,880
If they had a podcast or
a Internet radio show,

2195
02:01:18,930 --> 02:01:22,930
we got to hear them argue about
chicks on the road who you know,

2196
02:01:22,931 --> 02:01:24,880
and you'd be like, Oh, you guys are gross.

2197
02:01:28,780 --> 02:01:33,280
It's like the mystery was so much better
than, you know, it's like Robert Plant,

2198
02:01:33,281 --> 02:01:36,400
the mystery of Robert Plant. I remember
growing up being a huge Zeppelin fan.

2199
02:01:36,401 --> 02:01:40,040
I mean I barely knew 10
words at plant said in

2200
02:01:40,040 --> 02:01:44,300
an interview, you know, I think I
heard any interviews. I just knew,

2201
02:01:44,790 --> 02:01:46,940
I just knew black dog was the shit,
you know.

2202
02:01:46,941 --> 02:01:50,820
I just knew whole lot of love is like
the greatest song in the history of the

2203
02:01:50,821 --> 02:01:51,471
world.
That's all I knew.

2204
02:01:51,471 --> 02:01:55,230
I didn't know anything about Robert Plant
and it might be annoying as fuck and

2205
02:01:55,270 --> 02:01:56,690
you,
you've dated Robert Plant.

2206
02:01:56,691 --> 02:02:01,691
It just turns out to be a total prima
Donna knowing and stupid and always

2207
02:02:02,451 --> 02:02:06,140
insecure and once everybody
kisses ass like fuck. Really?

2208
02:02:08,280 --> 02:02:12,830
It's like when Mel Gibson was screaming
at that ex-girlfriend shot up,

2209
02:02:13,580 --> 02:02:17,450
blow me and he's like yelling at her,
answering so much.

2210
02:02:18,860 --> 02:02:21,440
I'm sure she was. I'm sure
she was. But it was like,

2211
02:02:21,740 --> 02:02:26,740
we never got a chance to see someone so
human before that was like a fucking Mel

2212
02:02:26,930 --> 02:02:27,051
Gibson mean.

2213
02:02:27,051 --> 02:02:31,850
He was brave heart and then all of a
sudden he's screaming to some scammer,

2214
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:36,050
some Russian scammer chick who's robbing
him and recording all of his phone

2215
02:02:36,051 --> 02:02:36,884
calls.

2216
02:02:36,930 --> 02:02:40,650
Shut up and blow me. And I'm like, wow.

2217
02:02:40,850 --> 02:02:44,940
Like this is Mel Gibson man.
This is the lethal weapon dude.

2218
02:02:45,750 --> 02:02:49,710
What the fuck? Kind of just like
that character and lethal weapon.

2219
02:02:49,711 --> 02:02:51,450
Wasn't he like a crazy,
he would.

2220
02:02:51,570 --> 02:02:55,830
Yeah, but he was kind. He was crazy. But
kind to women with the CRA the wrong.

2221
02:02:55,860 --> 02:02:57,220
What was wrong with the crazy?

2222
02:02:57,350 --> 02:03:01,410
What was wrong with the crazy first of
all does he was scary as fuck to a woman

2223
02:03:01,411 --> 02:03:02,280
who had his child.

2224
02:03:02,550 --> 02:03:05,190
Like he couldn't even keep it together
to this woman who had his child.

2225
02:03:05,191 --> 02:03:07,890
That was the scariest thing.
It's like he had a baby with this person.

2226
02:03:07,891 --> 02:03:12,240
She's watching his baby and he's fucking
screaming bloody murder at her. That's,

2227
02:03:12,540 --> 02:03:13,470
he's a scary dude,

2228
02:03:13,780 --> 02:03:16,420
you know. Did that freak you
out? The Mel Gibson Shit?

2229
02:03:16,960 --> 02:03:21,670
I am known to give it a bad talk about
Mel Gibson. No, no. I just, it's like,

2230
02:03:21,810 --> 02:03:24,370
I don't know. You didn't hear that.
That thing when it was in the news.

2231
02:03:24,430 --> 02:03:29,050
I really don't watch television.
I like knowing the human side of people.

2232
02:03:29,051 --> 02:03:30,580
I love reality shows.

2233
02:03:30,581 --> 02:03:34,090
I actually do mob wives
and moms and Mama drama.

2234
02:03:34,420 --> 02:03:38,920
Forget about a watch monitor wives,
the one with the little girl,

2235
02:03:38,980 --> 02:03:42,060
the Mama drama,
they take,

2236
02:03:42,250 --> 02:03:45,820
they take six sets of mothers and
daughters like that party together.

2237
02:03:45,920 --> 02:03:48,400
They were like 43 and 22

2238
02:03:49,990 --> 02:03:52,330
and they put six couples athlon black,

2239
02:03:52,331 --> 02:03:57,331
half them white in a penthouse in
Vegas and they get drunk everyday.

2240
02:03:57,880 --> 02:04:00,520
It's hysterical. Wow.
It's great. That's genius.

2241
02:04:00,740 --> 02:04:04,280
Yeah. There's some fun in reality
shows, but you know it's, it's,

2242
02:04:04,400 --> 02:04:07,900
it's really like mindless
distraction. That's the
problem. You don't get anything.

2243
02:04:08,160 --> 02:04:10,480
Sometimes you need that.
Sometimes you need to do you like that?

2244
02:04:10,540 --> 02:04:15,520
I like not thinking about shit and
watching South Park or watching some mine.

2245
02:04:15,550 --> 02:04:20,050
I W I want to be mindless. It's like
meditation. I don't mind mindlessness of,

2246
02:04:20,051 --> 02:04:22,090
it's in the form of comedy,
like Southpark type.

2247
02:04:22,091 --> 02:04:25,910
It's nice knowing how people really are
like, Holy Shit, mob lives. Chicago.

2248
02:04:27,070 --> 02:04:29,320
People aren't really like
that. They're not. No.

2249
02:04:29,321 --> 02:04:33,550
I mean I think you're putting
a hyper it, it's such a, yeah,

2250
02:04:33,551 --> 02:04:37,000
that's the alcohol they put, make them
live together. It's edited and produced.

2251
02:04:37,320 --> 02:04:38,130
I totally believe

2252
02:04:38,130 --> 02:04:39,810
that. Not really how, whatever.

2253
02:04:40,020 --> 02:04:44,090
But really our people that are acting
like that on camera and that's as fast as

2254
02:04:44,180 --> 02:04:47,760
that. Yeah, I love it. I definitely
doesn't inspire me though. That shit.

2255
02:04:50,210 --> 02:04:54,510
Some days mob lives comes out.
Are you kidding? So stupid. The,

2256
02:04:54,511 --> 02:04:56,130
the real housewives of Beverly Hills.

2257
02:04:56,131 --> 02:04:59,040
I watched the real housewives
of Miami ad the other day,

2258
02:04:59,130 --> 02:05:02,630
just the ad and I cringe and I
just grabbed the remote controller,

2259
02:05:02,640 --> 02:05:03,570
shut it off quick.

2260
02:05:03,571 --> 02:05:07,050
Like just thinking that these women could
enter into my life somehow or another

2261
02:05:07,051 --> 02:05:08,640
through me watching them on TV,

2262
02:05:08,910 --> 02:05:12,180
but somehow or another they can make
their way into my life would be annoying

2263
02:05:12,181 --> 02:05:15,750
and yapping at me and they were hitting
each other and screaming at each other,

2264
02:05:15,751 --> 02:05:18,500
you know, he and Miami, you got to do this
and you're going to do that. Then. Oh,

2265
02:05:18,510 --> 02:05:22,010
come on. I don't watch that show.
Just, I don't watch all reality shows.

2266
02:05:22,050 --> 02:05:24,840
Just a couple. We got, there's
gotta be fighting and violence.

2267
02:05:24,841 --> 02:05:26,160
If there's not fighting,
I don't want to watch it.

2268
02:05:26,260 --> 02:05:30,390
Is that a weird position for you to be in
a reality show when you, you know, you,

2269
02:05:30,391 --> 02:05:31,110
you're,
you're,

2270
02:05:31,110 --> 02:05:33,810
you've got a very different sort of a
reality show because it's obviously a

2271
02:05:33,811 --> 02:05:36,870
reality show about your artwork. I
mean, it's about your expression.

2272
02:05:36,871 --> 02:05:37,970
It's about originally

2273
02:05:38,540 --> 02:05:42,650
docu series. It was a very formatted
show is like where you, you,

2274
02:05:42,770 --> 02:05:45,770
the premise was like you would
learn the story about the tat,

2275
02:05:45,880 --> 02:05:48,680
the story behind each of the tattoos
and the interaction between tattooer and

2276
02:05:48,681 --> 02:05:50,060
client.
And then that,

2277
02:05:50,120 --> 02:05:54,980
and then like I was 80% of the show in
the 20% of it was our own personal life

2278
02:05:54,981 --> 02:05:57,920
stories. You know, that we're
somehow connected to tattooing.

2279
02:05:57,921 --> 02:06:02,060
And then as the show went
on, I can't, man, I can't
believe we were on for so long,

2280
02:06:02,061 --> 02:06:06,710
you know? And um, how many seasons
where you on for? It's, it's,

2281
02:06:06,711 --> 02:06:11,120
it's weird because, uh, contractually
it's different. It's different.

2282
02:06:11,121 --> 02:06:15,980
We were basically on for, uh,
seven years. Six or seven years.

2283
02:06:16,010 --> 02:06:16,500
Wow.

2284
02:06:16,500 --> 02:06:19,920
That's incredible. Yeah. What's
a great premise for a show? Yeah.

2285
02:06:21,670 --> 02:06:23,010
Two more.
The it flipped,

2286
02:06:23,011 --> 02:06:27,830
so it's like 20% are an 80% drama and
most of it was produced. Hence, oh,

2287
02:06:27,831 --> 02:06:29,150
that girl got on the show,
which I don't know.

2288
02:06:31,790 --> 02:06:34,970
Yeah. Well why do that? See
that's, that's Hollywood idiots.

2289
02:06:35,090 --> 02:06:39,380
Because I think first of all,
I'm a fan of tattoos and ours of course,

2290
02:06:39,390 --> 02:06:42,740
and just having a show where it was just,
you produce it,

2291
02:06:42,890 --> 02:06:45,400
you dictate what's going on.
Just about the actors.

2292
02:06:45,700 --> 02:06:47,340
It seems like you could do that though.
Yeah.

2293
02:06:47,390 --> 02:06:49,280
And people would enjoy it
and it would be pure. I mean,

2294
02:06:49,281 --> 02:06:52,860
I would watch a time lapse of, oh my God,
that's the old footage. Why shouldn't it?

2295
02:06:52,970 --> 02:06:54,770
Why should you do it that way?
I mean,

2296
02:06:54,771 --> 02:06:58,370
it seems like someone who would be an
idiot to try to do it in any way other

2297
02:06:58,371 --> 02:07:01,130
than your personality.
Why would they not do that?

2298
02:07:01,600 --> 02:07:05,600
Really? It's the way it's not,
it's not the, it's the demand.

2299
02:07:05,601 --> 02:07:07,810
Do you know what I mean? It's, it's
not the domain. It is the demand.

2300
02:07:07,811 --> 02:07:09,370
Because what it is,
it's like it's,

2301
02:07:09,371 --> 02:07:11,710
it's all based on money and
numbers for the network.

2302
02:07:11,711 --> 02:07:16,711
So whatever situations and drama show
peaks and they have these tests that they

2303
02:07:17,891 --> 02:07:20,300
run, that's what they,
and I don't believe it.

2304
02:07:20,530 --> 02:07:23,590
I can't disagree more with
you. Hey listen, this is why

2305
02:07:23,980 --> 02:07:27,940
I would, I, I'm on your, I'm on your
side. I know you are. I know you are.

2306
02:07:27,970 --> 02:07:31,480
But the way that the network sees it is
what's going to generate more money and

2307
02:07:31,481 --> 02:07:32,231
it's going to be viewership.

2308
02:07:32,231 --> 02:07:34,210
Cause they could sell advertisement
that's wrong about that.

2309
02:07:34,240 --> 02:07:36,040
I know they are of the wrong.
That's why they've

2310
02:07:36,160 --> 02:07:37,920
killed.
I mean it played it out.

2311
02:07:37,960 --> 02:07:40,150
Well what they're doing is
they just go with the box.

2312
02:07:40,180 --> 02:07:44,150
They go with what's word with
what's worked before. This
is the formula, you know.

2313
02:07:44,160 --> 02:07:47,800
Okay, here's the wacky neighbor. Go.
You know, I mean that's the formula.

2314
02:07:47,801 --> 02:07:51,630
I mean they don't, it doesn't have to be
that. That's so silly. Wacky neighbor. He,

2315
02:07:51,670 --> 02:07:54,130
you're whacking Eva. Brian, you
want to be ever wacky neighbor.

2316
02:07:54,790 --> 02:07:57,650
He would be awesome at it.
Give you the work you've done.

2317
02:07:57,740 --> 02:07:59,320
He's a breakthrough talent.
I'm telling you,

2318
02:07:59,540 --> 02:08:03,790
you can really knock you
guys over the top, bring it,

2319
02:08:03,940 --> 02:08:05,230
bring the ratings to the top.

2320
02:08:06,090 --> 02:08:09,130
It's just people enjoy people
who are really good at things.

2321
02:08:09,131 --> 02:08:11,530
I mean that's really what it is.
That people also enjoy train wrecks,

2322
02:08:11,531 --> 02:08:14,880
which is why you love the house wide,
but you don't only enjoy it.

2323
02:08:15,270 --> 02:08:16,021
They only do.

2324
02:08:16,021 --> 02:08:20,390
But I think that there is
definitely people and some people,

2325
02:08:20,640 --> 02:08:24,360
not everybody, but some people
get lost in, um, in, in that

2326
02:08:24,510 --> 02:08:27,930
they do. But it's not like, look,
there's a lot of dumb shit on my DVR.

2327
02:08:27,960 --> 02:08:30,630
There's plenty of dumb
shit. I'm, I mean I do,

2328
02:08:30,810 --> 02:08:34,920
I watch dumb shit both for escape and
for material because there's some funny

2329
02:08:34,921 --> 02:08:35,640
shit in it.
Yeah.

2330
02:08:35,640 --> 02:08:39,060
But it's also like a lot of like really
intelligent shit on my DVR to like

2331
02:08:39,061 --> 02:08:43,140
documentaries that Morgan Freeman show
through the wormhole fucking amazing show.

2332
02:08:43,350 --> 02:08:48,350
But it's like the same people watch both
things and I think that a well produced

2333
02:08:48,391 --> 02:08:52,950
version of your show that's,
you decide what the fuck goes on.

2334
02:08:52,951 --> 02:08:55,290
You decide you're the
artists. Yeah. Of course you,

2335
02:08:55,291 --> 02:08:57,780
you talk to these people about their,
their ideas,

2336
02:08:57,900 --> 02:09:01,230
you create their tattoos and stop fucking
around with all that fake shit and it

2337
02:09:01,250 --> 02:09:05,760
would be beautiful. That
dumb mother fuckers I Kat Von
d alone. You stupid fucks.

2338
02:09:05,820 --> 02:09:07,500
No,
I just think Hollywood hacks.

2339
02:09:07,800 --> 02:09:10,620
You just got to cut out that
middle man and cookie cutter cuts.

2340
02:09:10,810 --> 02:09:12,450
You don't know what you're doing.
Leave her alone.

2341
02:09:12,720 --> 02:09:16,710
Yeah. Yeah. That's it. You
tell them. Yeah. Those fucks
creating some fake nonsense.

2342
02:09:16,800 --> 02:09:19,650
Silly, silly bitches. Yeah.
I ended up just filming,

2343
02:09:19,651 --> 02:09:22,950
like I secretly filmed the documentary.
Oh. Uh, for the last three years now.

2344
02:09:22,951 --> 02:09:27,150
We actually finally pretty much done
with it. And, um, and it's, it's awesome.

2345
02:09:27,151 --> 02:09:28,020
It's so freeing,
you know,

2346
02:09:28,021 --> 02:09:30,150
to be able to do it that way and
having the control and stuff.

2347
02:09:30,670 --> 02:09:34,800
I wish I could have given as, as much
as I gave him my documentary to show,

2348
02:09:34,801 --> 02:09:37,770
but I really couldn't because it
wasn't mine, you know? And um,

2349
02:09:38,050 --> 02:09:41,390
you should totally have your
own show for the Internet.

2350
02:09:41,630 --> 02:09:45,170
It'd be fucking gigantic. Just,
just film while you're working,

2351
02:09:45,171 --> 02:09:48,950
you're going to do it anyway. Just film
while you're working, loosely edited,

2352
02:09:49,220 --> 02:09:51,110
you know,
throw a little bumper in the beginning,

2353
02:09:51,111 --> 02:09:54,230
throw that shit online and get a million
views a day. Yeah. What he wants to see.

2354
02:09:54,231 --> 02:09:54,980
Good stuff.

2355
02:09:54,980 --> 02:09:58,040
I know, but I want to create things
with a lot of qualities. I'm not,

2356
02:09:58,041 --> 02:10:01,370
I can't just like have fast edit stuff,
you know, just slap that bitch together.

2357
02:10:02,450 --> 02:10:05,420
I have to get like my friend who does,
you know,

2358
02:10:05,500 --> 02:10:09,260
Clyde butcher and did like to kind
of a control freak too. No, no, no.

2359
02:10:09,261 --> 02:10:14,170
I just have an excellent, I just having
creative intention. Right. Right. So,

2360
02:10:14,600 --> 02:10:18,590
uh, whatever, but I mean an
excellence freak. You want
it to be x. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2361
02:10:18,770 --> 02:10:21,140
Um, but yeah, I think now nowadays,

2362
02:10:21,141 --> 02:10:22,500
just with everything I
have going on and it just,

2363
02:10:22,520 --> 02:10:24,110
it's so time consuming to do television.

2364
02:10:24,160 --> 02:10:27,310
Do you take on apprentices or do you
have assistants or people who ever work

2365
02:10:27,311 --> 02:10:29,620
with you want to learn how to Tattoo?
Was that ever happened?

2366
02:10:30,220 --> 02:10:33,090
Don't, at our shop, you know, I have
20 guys that worked with me and I love,

2367
02:10:33,230 --> 02:10:36,580
we're like, we're brothers and sisters
with 20 guys. I mean, you know,

2368
02:10:36,590 --> 02:10:40,640
this is includes like our shop managers
and stuff like that, you know, and,

2369
02:10:40,970 --> 02:10:44,630
and like Dennis, he's like my first
guy ever hired. He's like still there.

2370
02:10:44,690 --> 02:10:47,810
Everybody's and we're so close, like
what you see on television. Those were,

2371
02:10:48,170 --> 02:10:48,870
you know,
like the,

2372
02:10:48,870 --> 02:10:53,210
the cast members that they didn't work
at the shop with the exception of Dan

2373
02:10:53,210 --> 02:10:55,330
Smith.
Like everybody else kind of just kind of,

2374
02:10:55,730 --> 02:10:58,610
they weren't really the true Hvt crew,
you know what I mean? Right. But, um,

2375
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:00,530
and we love each other.
We love the way it is.

2376
02:11:00,531 --> 02:11:04,310
And I feel like when you have
an apprentice that changes
the dynamic because it

2377
02:11:04,311 --> 02:11:06,290
makes somebody better than somebody else.

2378
02:11:06,320 --> 02:11:09,980
And the way that we work is that we're
all good at what we do in different ways.

2379
02:11:09,980 --> 02:11:14,300
So we're all better and not as good as
each other and we inspire each other and

2380
02:11:14,301 --> 02:11:16,430
keep each other, you know what
I mean? So it's a collective,

2381
02:11:16,460 --> 02:11:20,330
it's like totally collective
and it's awesome. That sounds
bad ass. It is. I mean,

2382
02:11:20,570 --> 02:11:22,940
it's, how does someone break
into your fold? How someone,

2383
02:11:23,530 --> 02:11:26,270
that's the hardest thing is
like, we've, like, we've never,

2384
02:11:26,271 --> 02:11:29,870
every time we've let anybody outside the
circle and it's never really worked out

2385
02:11:29,871 --> 02:11:32,420
the way we need it. So it's
always a, you know, it's,

2386
02:11:32,421 --> 02:11:35,720
it's basically just who we know
and kind of comes through that way.

2387
02:11:35,810 --> 02:11:37,160
Were there any people that you work

2388
02:11:37,240 --> 02:11:41,740
growing when you were growing up that
you look towards for inspiration that,

2389
02:11:41,741 --> 02:11:45,880
that inspire you and, and,
and, and like just give you,

2390
02:11:45,910 --> 02:11:48,010
gave you momentum to create or,

2391
02:11:48,430 --> 02:11:50,770
um, yeah, I mean, I think
like when I was a kid,

2392
02:11:50,771 --> 02:11:54,160
I used to look at Tattoo magazines and
when I say kid, I mean like 16 and stuff.

2393
02:11:54,161 --> 02:11:58,000
And like I remember looking up to
Jack Rudy, he was like, oh yeah,

2394
02:11:58,001 --> 02:12:01,910
the black and gray God father and all this
stuff and amazing work. That guy. Yeah.

2395
02:12:01,911 --> 02:12:02,730
Yeah. And so, uh,

2396
02:12:02,730 --> 02:12:06,020
the day I turned 18 I had beforehand
I made an appointment with him.

2397
02:12:06,021 --> 02:12:07,210
And really it's an advanced.

2398
02:12:07,211 --> 02:12:12,040
And I was so excited about it and
I went and got this tattoo and um,

2399
02:12:12,190 --> 02:12:14,950
and I sat there for the fucking
six hours it took or whatever.

2400
02:12:14,951 --> 02:12:17,870
And it's one of my favorite tattoos.
It's so beautiful. I still love it. Um,

2401
02:12:17,890 --> 02:12:20,200
but I remember him sitting
there going like, ah, you know,

2402
02:12:20,630 --> 02:12:22,780
you guys don't have any
business in the business.

2403
02:12:22,781 --> 02:12:26,290
And all of a sudden I was like an 18
year old kid back then and you know,

2404
02:12:26,291 --> 02:12:28,570
he's very old school and like
sees things a different way.

2405
02:12:28,570 --> 02:12:33,280
And at the time I was like, heartbroken,
you know, it was like, oh, uh,

2406
02:12:33,370 --> 02:12:35,680
my, uh, here, I don't
know he's been a hero,

2407
02:12:35,681 --> 02:12:39,940
but like he was somebody I admired
his work just like shut me down.

2408
02:12:39,941 --> 02:12:43,240
But then at the same time like, ah,
it's cool. Like, I'll watch this. Like,

2409
02:12:43,241 --> 02:12:46,980
you know what I mean? And
then, and now, you know, fast
forward now that mean we've,

2410
02:12:47,190 --> 02:12:52,030
we know each other and you know, he's,
did you tell him that story? Um, no.

2411
02:12:52,150 --> 02:12:57,010
He knows it. He doesn't remember.
Yeah, he, I bet he doesn't remember.

2412
02:12:57,080 --> 02:13:01,320
You have, I mean, I remember like,
uh, one of the coolest stories. Yeah.

2413
02:13:01,330 --> 02:13:04,420
When I was tattooing unprofessionally,
when it was like an amateur,

2414
02:13:04,480 --> 02:13:05,830
like 16 year old I went into,

2415
02:13:05,980 --> 02:13:08,770
I had heard that there was this girl
who owned a shop in Culver city.

2416
02:13:08,771 --> 02:13:12,010
It was like the only female artists,
that own shop. I was like, whoa.

2417
02:13:12,011 --> 02:13:13,900
And her name was Erica Stanley.
She was bad ass.

2418
02:13:14,230 --> 02:13:17,340
And so I remember going down national and,

2419
02:13:17,510 --> 02:13:20,320
and I go in there and I was
like, oh my God, we're here.

2420
02:13:20,330 --> 02:13:23,740
And it was just a tattoo shop,
whatever. And I see her and she's like,

2421
02:13:23,741 --> 02:13:26,020
really beautiful. And like,
she's just like a power,

2422
02:13:26,021 --> 02:13:29,320
like she's like a force of
nature. And, um, she's like,
can I help you? And I'm like,

2423
02:13:29,860 --> 02:13:32,850
yeah, you know, and I was just
probably being over over the cocky,

2424
02:13:32,851 --> 02:13:36,120
you're thinking that I had gained a place
in the tattoo industry when I was just

2425
02:13:36,140 --> 02:13:39,060
a 16 year old little punk in with a,
with a bullshit bang on my arm.

2426
02:13:39,390 --> 02:13:43,470
And it's like, and, and I'm just like,
oh man. So do you have any advice for me?

2427
02:13:43,471 --> 02:13:45,600
And I remember, she's like, yeah, Ma,

2428
02:13:45,630 --> 02:13:48,420
the best advice I could give
you as a run while you can.

2429
02:13:48,520 --> 02:13:51,690
And I remember I was so pissed off
like, oh yeah, well fuck you. You know,

2430
02:13:51,990 --> 02:13:55,020
and I left and then years later I
understood what she meant by it. You know,

2431
02:13:55,021 --> 02:13:57,630
it wasn't that she was saying, Oh, you're
not good enough. It's just like, ah,

2432
02:13:57,780 --> 02:13:58,890
like if you got the eye of the tire,

2433
02:13:58,891 --> 02:14:00,390
you're going to do it and
you're figure out your yourself.

2434
02:14:00,391 --> 02:14:03,040
There's nothing I could tell you.
It's to make you better as you know,

2435
02:14:03,060 --> 02:14:07,140
if I were to sit there and cuddle
you, like good as that. And she, she,

2436
02:14:07,350 --> 02:14:09,690
she saw tattooing a sacred,
and I remember I went to,

2437
02:14:09,691 --> 02:14:13,350
my first tattoo convention was
18. I was like, ink slinger is,

2438
02:14:13,351 --> 02:14:15,270
I don't even know if it's still,
it's still around, but um,

2439
02:14:15,720 --> 02:14:19,380
and one of these guys that I
tattooed a Vargas portrait on,

2440
02:14:20,040 --> 02:14:24,840
entered it into the context of best black
and gray. And she was the judge. And, uh,

2441
02:14:24,841 --> 02:14:25,021
you know,

2442
02:14:25,021 --> 02:14:29,190
she never knew my name at the time when
I was 16 and I got first place and she

2443
02:14:29,191 --> 02:14:31,650
voted for me. And I remember going
up to check, oh, congratulations.

2444
02:14:31,651 --> 02:14:34,770
It was really beautiful. I'm like, Hey,
you know what's funny? When I was 16,

2445
02:14:34,771 --> 02:14:37,170
I went to your shop and you told me
that I should go run while I can.

2446
02:14:37,171 --> 02:14:41,250
And she goes, oh my God. No. I'm like,
I just want to say thank you. It's cool,

2447
02:14:41,251 --> 02:14:44,540
you know? And well, you accepted that
inspiration. The right word. Yeah. Yeah.

2448
02:14:44,590 --> 02:14:47,280
She's still bad ass. It was, it was,
it was cool. You know, she's still,

2449
02:14:47,370 --> 02:14:50,490
I think a pioneer as far as la goes,
you know,

2450
02:14:50,491 --> 02:14:52,500
and it's cool comics

2451
02:14:52,630 --> 02:14:53,490
and,
um,

2452
02:14:53,830 --> 02:14:57,780
tattoo artists have a lot in
common in that it's a very much a,

2453
02:14:58,060 --> 02:15:02,850
an outside chance of success. We're all
fucked up. Yeah. We're all both of, yeah,

2454
02:15:02,890 --> 02:15:04,270
we're,
we're both fucked up.

2455
02:15:04,740 --> 02:15:08,050
We both have too much
expression and it's a,

2456
02:15:08,060 --> 02:15:11,050
it's one of those things where
like, you know, if you say,

2457
02:15:11,170 --> 02:15:15,480
what does your daughter do?
Oh, my daughter's a tattoo
artists. Like, oh Jesus,

2458
02:15:15,510 --> 02:15:17,130
your picture and fucking bikers

2459
02:15:17,230 --> 02:15:19,720
bars. And I'd be scared if you told
me her daughter's a cheerleader.

2460
02:15:19,940 --> 02:15:24,070
Oh yeah. Around football players. Yeah.
Ridiculous. But you know, you say,

2461
02:15:24,071 --> 02:15:28,420
oh my daughter's Kat von d. It's
like, oh, she's a famous celebrity.

2462
02:15:28,421 --> 02:15:31,960
Tattooist I've seen that show.
She's beautiful.

2463
02:15:32,650 --> 02:15:35,740
Different sort of, you know,
it's like as you, you tell you,

2464
02:15:35,741 --> 02:15:37,440
if you try to tell your
parents you want to be a comic,

2465
02:15:37,450 --> 02:15:39,880
they look at you like good fucking luck.

2466
02:15:40,140 --> 02:15:41,880
Like you need to get a
job that's going to work.

2467
02:15:41,881 --> 02:15:45,400
Like that's not what do you really want
to do? Yeah, exactly. Well, you know,

2468
02:15:45,401 --> 02:15:49,540
you need to have a backup plan and you
know, I don't think anybody before you,

2469
02:15:49,720 --> 02:15:53,470
that's the, the nuttiest thing about
what you did is you became like mean Ami.

2470
02:15:53,471 --> 02:15:56,680
I guess his famous too, but he's not
famous in the same way. You know,

2471
02:15:56,890 --> 02:16:00,670
that show was that the first show Miami
ink was at the first of those ink shows.

2472
02:16:00,880 --> 02:16:03,730
He, for whatever reason, it's just,
it never, it wasn't the same thing.

2473
02:16:04,400 --> 02:16:06,810
Is that what it is? Yeah,
I think so. I mean people,

2474
02:16:07,170 --> 02:16:10,310
I mean a guy with the shirt off.
And I'm not saying that he's not a,

2475
02:16:10,340 --> 02:16:13,230
I don't know him anymore. I haven't
seen him in years since those times.

2476
02:16:13,231 --> 02:16:17,640
And back then I was a drunken
mess. But um, you know, people can,

2477
02:16:18,360 --> 02:16:20,010
I think your looks get you so far,
you know,

2478
02:16:20,011 --> 02:16:22,650
and after a while you have to actually
care about what you're doing and,

2479
02:16:22,830 --> 02:16:26,610
and you know what I mean? So I think
at the time it was probably hard.

2480
02:16:26,970 --> 02:16:30,040
I can only assume how difficult it
would be for something new. Like

2481
02:16:30,210 --> 02:16:33,450
there's a sensation of a new
tattoo show and being like the,

2482
02:16:33,451 --> 02:16:37,270
the front man for that must be
a sidetracking at times. Maybe.

2483
02:16:37,271 --> 02:16:39,130
I'm not sure in the,
you can make mistakes,

2484
02:16:39,140 --> 02:16:40,570
but if you could go back and do it again,

2485
02:16:40,571 --> 02:16:42,820
knowing the reaction to
all those different things,

2486
02:16:43,040 --> 02:16:46,630
how we do something a little
different. Yeah, yeah.

2487
02:16:46,631 --> 02:16:49,550
I know what you're talking about.
So it's that, that, you know,

2488
02:16:50,150 --> 02:16:52,510
sometimes it's hard when there's
no one fucked up before you,

2489
02:16:52,630 --> 02:16:56,440
no one fucked up before you that you could
watch and learn from all the fuck ups

2490
02:16:56,441 --> 02:16:58,030
and you get all the assholes in the world.
And it'd be like,

2491
02:16:58,031 --> 02:17:02,470
I don't want to be like them. There
you go. They end, they, you know,

2492
02:17:02,471 --> 02:17:05,230
and that is the case. I mean, you
know, we, we don't live in a vacuum.

2493
02:17:05,470 --> 02:17:07,480
We all need those assholes to show us.

2494
02:17:07,480 --> 02:17:11,980
What's what it feels like to watch someone
be an asshole. I know. I think it just,

2495
02:17:11,981 --> 02:17:15,790
as much as you need inspirational people,
I guess we need them all.

2496
02:17:16,090 --> 02:17:20,020
We need everybody, right? Prime. Oh
yeah. What are you doing over there?

2497
02:17:20,500 --> 02:17:24,340
Drinking coke. Sarah caught you off guard.

2498
02:17:25,110 --> 02:17:28,990
Chugging. Well listen, Kathy has been
a lot of really, really interesting.

2499
02:17:29,440 --> 02:17:33,130
Anytime, anytime you know you, you're
very easy to talk to. A really,

2500
02:17:33,220 --> 02:17:36,250
really cool to talk to him.
Fun have on your life.

2501
02:17:36,251 --> 02:17:38,560
Do you have like three
years or something crazy?

2502
02:17:38,561 --> 02:17:42,340
Like would you be willing to draw a
death squad cat on Brian's back draw or

2503
02:17:42,341 --> 02:17:47,290
Tattoo Tattoo? I'm sorry. You know what
I mean? I mean he did get mine fixed.

2504
02:17:47,680 --> 02:17:50,890
Oh yeah, the one that's fucked
up. Yeah. We'll pull that shit up.

2505
02:17:51,070 --> 02:17:53,500
What could you do to that?
What could you do that?

2506
02:17:53,710 --> 02:17:57,670
Would he have to go and get that
lasered? The options are endless. Nah,

2507
02:17:57,671 --> 02:18:01,710
you can do something. You got options.
Really? We'll talk. Cool. Really?

2508
02:18:02,140 --> 02:18:07,140
You think you could do a cover up on that?
That's beautiful. Look at that Brian.

2509
02:18:07,150 --> 02:18:09,940
We've got something going on here
for you. It's beautiful. Listen,

2510
02:18:10,260 --> 02:18:13,540
is there anything that people,
anything you're sewing.

2511
02:18:13,541 --> 02:18:17,710
I know you had a book out
for awhile. People buy that.
I'm not a good commercial.

2512
02:18:17,770 --> 02:18:20,710
Do you have a website that people can
go and stalk you from her book is,

2513
02:18:20,711 --> 02:18:24,700
I actually figured out her
books online here. Here it is.

2514
02:18:25,570 --> 02:18:27,610
You guys are forcing stuff on it.

2515
02:18:30,560 --> 02:18:31,600
We're happy to have you.

2516

come here and hang out with.

2517
02:18:35,140 --> 02:18:37,900
I wanted to come and seen her. Oh No. It's

2518
