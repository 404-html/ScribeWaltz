1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:01,350
Yeah,
I had,

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:03,030
I had an incident,
uh,

3
00:00:03,031 --> 00:00:04,950
on a,
on the airplane going to Indianapolis.

4
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:07,860
Where this,
this guy like,

5
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:12,240
I don't know,
I just started like interrogating me.

6
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:15,030
He thought it was some sort of flight
risk about what,

7
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,520
I dunno,
he was on something.

8
00:00:17,521 --> 00:00:19,230
I don't know what happened.
Like I was sitting down.

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,330
So he's just a passenger.
Yeah.

10
00:00:21,331 --> 00:00:23,220
And I was,
I didn't know if he was a sky marshal,

11
00:00:23,221 --> 00:00:25,140
but he,
he ordered a doers in the beginning and

12
00:00:25,141 --> 00:00:27,510
he just slammed it.
[inaudible] so I'm like,

13
00:00:27,511 --> 00:00:29,020
this guy's not a scar.
My Sky Marshal,

14
00:00:29,021 --> 00:00:32,400
this guy's boozing it up.
So he just goes to me,

15
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:33,550
he's like,
Eh,

16
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:37,110
which is sitting there and he just says,
he goes,

17
00:00:37,111 --> 00:00:38,610
hey you,
are you afraid to fly?

18
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,280
And I'm like,
what?

19
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:42,270
He goes,
are you afraid of flag?

20
00:00:42,271 --> 00:00:43,530
Oh No,
I'm not afraid to fly.

21
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,210
And he goes,
you sure?

22
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:48,420
Cause you know it's okay.
You can tell me if you are immediately,

23
00:00:48,421 --> 00:00:49,320
I'm looking at this guy.
What do you mean?

24
00:00:49,321 --> 00:00:50,154
It's like,
okay,

25
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,640
what is this like interrogation one o
one,

26
00:00:53,641 --> 00:00:57,060
build a relationship with your subject
thing that you're doing here.

27
00:00:57,061 --> 00:00:58,230
And I was just like,
no.

28
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,093
He goes,
dude.

29
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:00,750
He goes,
all right cause you know,

30
00:01:00,751 --> 00:01:02,160
he just kind of fidgeting and looking
around.

31
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:03,121
I was like,
no man.

32
00:01:03,121 --> 00:01:03,954
I go,
I'm cool.

33
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,520
He's like,
oh you like to fly.

34
00:01:05,521 --> 00:01:05,881
I'm like,
what?

35
00:01:05,881 --> 00:01:08,040
I'm up here cause he don't,
I bumped myself up and going on back

36
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:08,874
there.
I don't like it.

37
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,490
And then he goes,
he's all right.

38
00:01:11,491 --> 00:01:12,860
You know,
but you know you,

39
00:01:12,861 --> 00:01:17,070
you can tell me if you're afraid to fly.
So now I'm just like,

40
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,680
dude,
I'm not afraid to fly.

41
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,550
So,
and he's staring at me and I put my hand

42
00:01:23,551 --> 00:01:25,080
like this to show that it wasn't
shaking.

43
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:26,340
I go,
I'm not nervous.

44
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:28,290
All right,
thanks for asking.

45
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:29,611
And then he goes,
well,

46
00:01:29,611 --> 00:01:30,930
anybody can do that.
And I'm just like,

47
00:01:30,931 --> 00:01:32,250
oh Jesus Christ.
And I just said,

48
00:01:32,251 --> 00:01:33,510
look dude,
I'm drinking water.

49
00:01:33,511 --> 00:01:35,130
You're drinking doers.
Okay.

50
00:01:35,131 --> 00:01:36,240
And he goes,
that wasn't doers,

51
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:37,140
right.
And I'm just like,

52
00:01:37,141 --> 00:01:40,740
I fucked this guy.
So I'm sitting there.

53
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,790
He,
you saw a mortar it,

54
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:43,560
huh?
You saw him order doers.

55
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:45,150
I was sitting and he said,
let me get a doors.

56
00:01:45,151 --> 00:01:47,610
And she brought her over neat and he
threw it back like he was drinking

57
00:01:47,611 --> 00:01:48,444
baby's milk.

58
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:53,790
What's impressive is this guy's old
school starting off good,

59
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:56,190
right?
So then there's like five minutes of

60
00:01:56,191 --> 00:01:57,840
silence,
more passages are getting on,

61
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,251
and then the guy goes,
hey,

62
00:01:59,251 --> 00:02:00,001
you know,
I'm sorry man,

63
00:02:00,001 --> 00:02:02,380
I just got off on a,
on the wrong foot there.

64
00:02:02,381 --> 00:02:02,791
Right?
He goes,

65
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:04,380
my name is so and so.
What's your name?

66
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:07,710
Asked me what my name is.
And I was thinking of saying something

67
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:08,550
like,
Steve,

68
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,413
you know,
and uh,

69
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,360
I wish I need Clark.
I wish I said some silly name,

70
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,490
you know,
but I didn't think of when I just went,

71
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,050
it's bill.
And he goes,

72
00:02:16,051 --> 00:02:16,884
okay.
He goes up.

73
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,420
Why?
Why are you going to Indianapolis Bill?

74
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,410
He started doing the shit and I just
look at the guy and I go,

75
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:23,761
I'm like,
yeah,

76
00:02:23,761 --> 00:02:26,520
I don't have to answer your questions.
Whoa,

77
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,860
I don't,
he has no fucking authority.

78
00:02:28,861 --> 00:02:30,060
You're not a sky marshal.

79
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,820
You're drinking booze,
you're an asshole.

80
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,720
What are you want?
Are you afraid to fly?

81
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,280
Go Fuck Yourself.
Leave me alone.

82
00:02:35,281 --> 00:02:37,220
Right?
So then he goes like,

83
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,073
all right,
now,

84
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,780
now I'm concerned.
Okay,

85
00:02:39,781 --> 00:02:41,550
I am concerned.
Okay,

86
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,920
why are you going to Indianapolis Bill,
right?

87
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:44,790
He says,
is this right?

88
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:48,360
And they closed the doors and that
they're doing all this stuff.

89
00:02:48,361 --> 00:02:50,040
And I just,
I just start like,

90
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:53,880
I joked to my podcasts,
I just started smirking like Ryan

91
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,061
Gosling,
you know,

92
00:02:54,061 --> 00:02:57,090
he does that little Mona Lisa smile.
We just kind of smile and I'm just

93
00:02:57,091 --> 00:02:58,290
sitting there shaking my head at the
guy,

94
00:02:58,291 --> 00:02:59,890
right?
And I'm literally taking out my eye

95
00:02:59,891 --> 00:03:02,170
pillow.
I wear like a mask just to say,

96
00:03:02,171 --> 00:03:04,630
I'm so not worried about anything that
you're going to fucking do all this

97
00:03:04,631 --> 00:03:06,550
passive aggressive,
shift this to piss this guy off.

98
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,440
And he's go,
why are you going to Indianapolis Belt?

99
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,420
And I just just kept,
I didn't say anything to him.

100
00:03:10,421 --> 00:03:12,960
I just kept laughing,
just kept shaking my head and um,

101
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,230
was taxiing down.
And he goes,

102
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,041
dude,
he goes,

103
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:18,220
I fucking do this for a fucking living
such ffffound and all this stuff.

104
00:03:18,221 --> 00:03:19,890
The lady in front turns around,
starts looking at what?

105
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,020
Taxi down the thing because you don't
answer my questions right now.

106
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,240
I'm going to hit that call button.
I will hit that call button.

107
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:28,510
I will stop this plane and you will be
fucking arrested like saying all this

108
00:03:28,511 --> 00:03:30,580
stuff and I'm just looking at him
smiling,

109
00:03:30,581 --> 00:03:31,361
shaking my head,
like,

110
00:03:31,361 --> 00:03:32,290
go ahead and push it,
dude.

111
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,810
Let's see where the fuck this goes
through the Hilarious,

112
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,390
what happens?
Does the pilot come out?

113
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,460
There's a police car pull up to the
play.

114
00:03:39,461 --> 00:03:42,520
No fucking clue.
So he goes to push it and you can't find

115
00:03:42,521 --> 00:03:43,330
it.

116
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:45,250
It was kind of a weird place and he
finally finds it.

117
00:03:45,251 --> 00:03:46,150
He hit the button.
I'm like,

118
00:03:46,151 --> 00:03:46,661
oh,
he fuck,

119
00:03:46,661 --> 00:03:48,400
he hit the button.
This is hilarious.

120
00:03:48,401 --> 00:03:49,780
And I'm just sitting there.
He goes,

121
00:03:49,781 --> 00:03:51,190
now you wait,
you fucking wait,

122
00:03:51,191 --> 00:03:52,750
blah blah blah.
And I'm just sitting there smiling,

123
00:03:52,751 --> 00:03:53,770
shaking my head at him.
I'm like,

124
00:03:53,771 --> 00:03:55,510
dude,
I don't care.

125
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,770
I don't get you're,
you're not.

126
00:03:56,771 --> 00:03:59,590
You have no fucking authority.
You're not going to hit me.

127
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,380
You're not going to do anything.
You're on fucking something.

128
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,650
But I'm not getting that dude.
If that guy had a vibe like he's going

129
00:04:05,651 --> 00:04:07,180
to punch me,
I would have been up in the,

130
00:04:07,181 --> 00:04:08,110
in the house.
But he didn't.

131
00:04:08,111 --> 00:04:10,420
He just had like that.
It was like a kid throwing a temper

132
00:04:10,421 --> 00:04:12,400
tantrum.
He wanted like this,

133
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,710
you want to seem like he wanted to be an
army ranger,

134
00:04:14,711 --> 00:04:17,150
but he didn't quite make it or what'd he
look like?

135
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,910
He was like a,
why are we doing in good shape?

136
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:22,750
You know why Redo white dude,
that dude who shot that Trayvon Martin

137
00:04:22,751 --> 00:04:24,620
kid who wasn't really a cop.
Yeah,

138
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:27,540
but he wanted to be a cop so he took it
to the next level and it's the same.

139
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:29,950
I could have squashed the whole thing
and just been like,

140
00:04:29,951 --> 00:04:30,940
look,
I'm a comedian,

141
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,880
but I'm going to Indianapolis.
If you'd like to come out to the show,

142
00:04:33,881 --> 00:04:35,890
I could have done that,
but I'm a dick and I hate,

143
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:39,250
I hate fucking,
I hate authority and this guy doesn't

144
00:04:39,251 --> 00:04:40,570
have any,
so fuck him.

145
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,210
So I just laugh now he pushes the
button.

146
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,430
So then the stewardess comes over and
she goes,

147
00:04:45,431 --> 00:04:46,031
yeah,
what's the problem?

148
00:04:46,031 --> 00:04:49,030
He goes to sky is a flight risk.
I am not comfortable flying with him,

149
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,250
but Baba Baba,
Baba and all the shit.

150
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,030
I was surprised how few people were
looking around.

151
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:55,030
People were just kind of sitting there
and this guy was wigging out and I'm

152
00:04:55,031 --> 00:04:57,370
just sitting there and then the
stewardess was like,

153
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,030
all right,
did anybody else see any behavior?

154
00:05:01,031 --> 00:05:02,440
And The lady was sitting in front of
him,

155
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,000
pointed at him and said,
yeah,

156
00:05:04,001 --> 00:05:06,010
he was berating any point and she
pointed me,

157
00:05:06,011 --> 00:05:08,170
he,
he was berating him and I'm just like,

158
00:05:08,171 --> 00:05:10,140
perfect.
So I'm literally putting my fucking ims

159
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,040
down as I'm talking to him just going,
hey,

160
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:13,690
I'm just a guy trying to go in
Indianapolis.

161
00:05:13,691 --> 00:05:16,070
This guy's drinking doers and he's
dropping the F bomb.

162
00:05:16,071 --> 00:05:16,691
Then I'm thinking,
fuck.

163
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:17,890
I said bomb,
you know,

164
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:23,340
prominent and there wasn't a problem and
this guy is just doing this thing where

165
00:05:23,561 --> 00:05:27,100
he wants to win.
He wants some sort of recognition of

166
00:05:27,101 --> 00:05:29,210
what,
whatever the fuck he thinks he is still

167
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:30,240
moving.
No.

168
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,870
At this point it fucking stopped.

169
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:33,430
It pulled over.
I forgot that part.

170
00:05:33,431 --> 00:05:36,160
It pulled over and stopped.
Dude,

171
00:05:36,161 --> 00:05:37,990
it's a fucking red eye.
Okay.

172
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:41,740
It stops.
Another stewards comes over and he goes,

173
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:43,720
what's the problem?
And he goes through the whole fucking

174
00:05:43,721 --> 00:05:45,310
thing.
And then in the end it's like basically

175
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:47,920
the captain at this point is going,
do I really have to come back there?

176
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,470
It's like really the red eye fucking
flight.

177
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:53,170
My last flight of the day I used to fly
combat missions,

178
00:05:53,171 --> 00:05:54,220
you know,
fucking boring.

179
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:56,860
This is to fly this fucking bus.
I don't want to deal with this bullshit.

180
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,930
Do I really have to come back there?
And then they finally asked him,

181
00:05:59,931 --> 00:06:00,261
I said,
hey,

182
00:06:00,261 --> 00:06:02,210
are you going to be comfortable flying
with this guy?

183
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,830
And He,
uh,

184
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,970
I think they acknowledged that he had
some sort of something there.

185
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,560
So cause you know what,
knowing that it's okay,

186
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,150
it's gonna be okay,
just put whatever,

187
00:06:11,151 --> 00:06:11,500
right.

188
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,150
That he had some sort of,
something like some sort of power that

189
00:06:14,151 --> 00:06:16,310
like they checked with him,
like,

190
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:19,790
you're going to stand down sir,
like to whatever s fucking spy he

191
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:23,330
thought he was.
So now we get back in line and we're

192
00:06:23,331 --> 00:06:24,890
taxing.
And as we're going down the runway,

193
00:06:24,891 --> 00:06:28,460
I got my eye thing on and I'm just
sitting there and he's yapping in my

194
00:06:28,461 --> 00:06:29,960
ear.
He goes,

195
00:06:29,961 --> 00:06:32,210
you think this is fucking over?
You think this is fucking over.

196
00:06:32,211 --> 00:06:35,390
And under this point I'm laughing.
I'm holding my stomach in a fucking

197
00:06:35,391 --> 00:06:38,360
laughing and it's driving them nuts and
I'm having a fucking ball with this guy.

198
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:39,321
And he goes,
uh,

199
00:06:39,321 --> 00:06:40,250
you know,
my dad's,

200
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:42,920
the CEO is some fucking company in
Indianapolis.

201
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:46,610
And he starts saying that he's going to
have me fucking arrested when I land.

202
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,280
And uh,
and he starts describing the view I was

203
00:06:49,281 --> 00:06:51,290
going to see from the jail,
like some law and order.

204
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,090
Oh,
you're going to let you get a picture of

205
00:06:53,091 --> 00:06:54,260
this photo.
Take a photo.

206
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,590
Now,
how could you not just have been filming

207
00:06:57,591 --> 00:07:00,350
video this whole entire time?
That would be amazing.

208
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,230
You can,
can't you just be in the moment and not

209
00:07:03,231 --> 00:07:06,290
turn into a film?
Crew story's even better.

210
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,360
The universe gave me this fucking
moment.

211
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,950
I'm telling this story.
I don't,

212
00:07:09,951 --> 00:07:13,150
I don't know.
So he fucking,

213
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,970
uh,
so then I got my thanks down and then he

214
00:07:15,971 --> 00:07:16,420
finally,
he's,

215
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:16,811
yeah,
he's going.

216
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:17,051
Yeah,
he,

217
00:07:17,051 --> 00:07:18,310
Oh,
you gonna love the view from the jail.

218
00:07:18,311 --> 00:07:19,780
You can see Lucas oil field and blah,
blah,

219
00:07:19,781 --> 00:07:20,021
blah,
blah,

220
00:07:20,021 --> 00:07:22,000
and all this shit.
And then he finds oil.

221
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:25,530
That's where the colts play this view.
Dude.

222
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,190
It was such,
such hacky interrogation.

223
00:07:27,191 --> 00:07:29,870
Then he finally said a,
he goes,

224
00:07:29,871 --> 00:07:30,704
you know what?
I'm glad.

225
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:31,641
I'm glad.
You know what?

226
00:07:31,641 --> 00:07:34,430
I fucking hope you do something.
I fucking hope you do something.

227
00:07:34,431 --> 00:07:38,420
We're up there and I'm fucking burst.
It was not sitting there with a

228
00:07:38,421 --> 00:07:42,350
blindfold on laughing at him.
It was driving him fucking nuts.

229
00:07:42,351 --> 00:07:45,710
It was great.
So then five minutes of silence,

230
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:49,550
10 minutes of silence goes by and I'm
finally thinking that maybe this shit's

231
00:07:49,551 --> 00:07:53,330
over or is he just sitting there staring
at the side of my head and then all of a

232
00:07:53,331 --> 00:07:55,310
sudden I just hear it right as I'm
starting to nod off,

233
00:07:55,311 --> 00:07:58,310
I just hear why you're going to
Indianapolis Bill.

234
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:04,870
And I just laugh.
So do my adrenaline was fucking going.

235
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,830
I was just like,
wow,

236
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,840
they're going to stop the plane.
This is fucking intense man.

237
00:08:07,841 --> 00:08:09,190
This is crazy.
What's going to happen?

238
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:11,980
And I'm totally innocent so I got to
kind of watch it happen.

239
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:15,340
So then I couldn't sleep.
So I was sitting there with that stupid

240
00:08:15,341 --> 00:08:17,380
mask on for like a half an hour and then
files just like,

241
00:08:17,381 --> 00:08:17,861
all right,
fuck it,

242
00:08:17,861 --> 00:08:21,130
I got to take it off and I got to deal
with this guy and I take it off and I

243
00:08:21,131 --> 00:08:24,970
look over and he's just teach this
passed out head hanging this fucking,

244
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:26,680
you know,
special ops guy.

245
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:31,610
You know you should really passed out.
You should fucking way Liam with a huge

246
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:34,940
haymaker right in the face and then
immediately pretend you're asleep.

247
00:08:34,941 --> 00:08:36,850
No now cause someone would have said
that,

248
00:08:36,851 --> 00:08:37,760
someone would have seen that.

249
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,050
So now you know what I did was I
immediately started pounding waters

250
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,450
cause I didn't have to go to the
bathroom and I wanted to get up on the

251
00:08:44,451 --> 00:08:46,700
play and just to see if he was going to
fucking wig out again.

252
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:50,110
It makes them sort of thing.
So you go to the bathroom.

253
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:54,640
I started slamming
would have water in your,

254
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:57,480
I have to go to full of fucking
bathroom.

255
00:08:57,481 --> 00:08:59,610
Like you can't believe in this fucking
guy's passed out.

256
00:08:59,611 --> 00:09:01,230
He's now,
I held it for the last hour.

257
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:05,460
He didn't wake up until we landed.
And then we pulled up to the terminal

258
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,170
and I got out and I stood up and he
wouldn't look at me and I'm thinking how

259
00:09:10,171 --> 00:09:12,300
he probably slept it off and I was
feeling fucking weird,

260
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:14,940
hopefully.
And The lady in front of me got up and

261
00:09:14,941 --> 00:09:17,040
she just goes,
she smiled and she said,

262
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:17,220
hey.

263
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,100
And I just said,
and I was like,

264
00:09:18,101 --> 00:09:18,481
oh,
that was,

265
00:09:18,481 --> 00:09:21,240
that was an interesting one.
And then he had the pillow like this,

266
00:09:21,241 --> 00:09:23,070
Joe,
he hit it behind here in some weird

267
00:09:23,071 --> 00:09:25,440
position in,
in some sort of like Alpha male way.

268
00:09:25,441 --> 00:09:27,180
He tried to get some sort of tough
thing.

269
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,520
The last word,
he took the pillow out and he threw it

270
00:09:29,521 --> 00:09:32,220
down the hint by between his legs and he
like grunted even like,

271
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:35,910
like he threw a pill down.
That was it.

272
00:09:35,911 --> 00:09:37,500
That was my trip to Indianapolis.
Oh.

273
00:09:37,501 --> 00:09:41,730
And then I worked at a theater and Elmo
was there.
