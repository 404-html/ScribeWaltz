1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:03,530
Hello Freak bitches are you,

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,160
here are so many stories about China.

3
00:00:05,161 --> 00:00:07,920
We talked about so many other things
besides the stories about China,

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:09,120
which is why we have to keep going.

5
00:00:09,121 --> 00:00:11,460
So you were about to tell
some crazy noodle story.

6
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:12,060
Oh yeah.

7
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,170
So they had these street meat,

8
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:13,960
which is great.

9
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,680
And this is Shanghai that
I knocked into this table.

10
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:17,341
I was like,

11
00:00:17,341 --> 00:00:18,690
sounds like a fucking truck.

12
00:00:18,691 --> 00:00:19,650
Fell over outside.

13
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:21,060
Uh,

14
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:21,271
yeah,

15
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:22,104
Shanghai.

16
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:23,160
But uh,

17
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:23,521
they were like,

18
00:00:23,521 --> 00:00:23,890
be careful.

19
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:24,631
The meets great.

20
00:00:24,631 --> 00:00:24,980
You just,

21
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:25,710
there's kebabs.

22
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:26,161
You pick it up,

23
00:00:26,161 --> 00:00:26,700
they roast it,

24
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:27,533
give it back to you.

25
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:28,651
Point three,

26
00:00:28,651 --> 00:00:28,981
two,

27
00:00:28,981 --> 00:00:29,814
whatever it is.

28
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:30,500
Um,

29
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,230
but how much money you
can get by with gesturing.

30
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,610
I learned hello and thank you.

31
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,960
Those are the only words I really knew.

32
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:37,690
Huh?

33
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:39,680
[inaudible] should I shouldn't,

34
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:43,230
I know that Ni Hao Kailand
to show my kids watch.

35
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:43,720
Really?

36
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:44,553
Kylene

37
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:46,710
yeah,

38
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:47,543
that's cool.

39
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:50,401
That's crazy.

40
00:00:50,401 --> 00:00:51,234
I can learn stuff.

41
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:52,350
Yeah.

42
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:52,711
So that's,

43
00:00:52,711 --> 00:00:54,500
we say Shisha Shisha is like,

44
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:55,020
thank you.

45
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:55,560
Ah,

46
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,130
okay.

47
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:57,000
It's also used some other way,

48
00:00:57,001 --> 00:00:57,630
but I don't know.

49
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:58,351
So how do you,

50
00:00:58,351 --> 00:00:59,040
um,

51
00:00:59,040 --> 00:00:59,730
gesturing,

52
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:04,530
I got sick at gesturing really except a
couple of times I would like big about

53
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:06,350
to go into like a noodle
store or something like that,

54
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,310
like a shop and I'd
have to call my friend.

55
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:09,270
They gave you burner phones,

56
00:01:09,271 --> 00:01:10,104
which was nice.

57
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:11,031
I could use and I was like,

58
00:01:11,031 --> 00:01:11,161
hey,

59
00:01:11,161 --> 00:01:12,840
how do you say noodles
and how do you say beef?

60
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:14,910
They'll tell me both
words and we just go in.

61
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:15,783
I'd be like,

62
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:16,711
what was it?

63
00:01:16,711 --> 00:01:17,940
I forget now man.

64
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,480
Man,

65
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,680
man is noodles

66
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,153
and uh,

67
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:25,730
one of the guys from the Matrix
movie is the word for beef.

68
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,220
Who's the black guy from the Matrix?

69
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:29,030
Morpheus.

70
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:29,301
No.

71
00:01:29,301 --> 00:01:29,960
Okay.

72
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,630
What's the main guy from the close?

73
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,240
His name?

74
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:32,571
Neil.

75
00:01:32,571 --> 00:01:33,404
Yeah.

76
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:34,130
Yeah.

77
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:35,610
That's how you say beef neo

78
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,280
and was the other one was the noodles man.

79
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,180
Again,

80
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:40,840
same yen,

81
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,110
yell or neo.

82
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:42,650
I don't know,

83
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:43,890
but I said that and then they're like,

84
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:45,260
they pointed the fucking menu.

85
00:01:45,261 --> 00:01:46,360
Like there's the 18 things.

86
00:01:46,361 --> 00:01:46,611
I'm like,

87
00:01:46,611 --> 00:01:46,971
lady,

88
00:01:46,971 --> 00:01:47,804
come on,

89
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:49,550
you can see me struggling with,

90
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:53,210
if I'm foreign and I come
in and go beef noodle,

91
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,130
just pick something for him.

92
00:01:55,131 --> 00:01:56,280
Listen to him just saying something.

93
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,080
Listen to his anus.

94
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:02,080
The amazing racist where if you would
be like learn the language you fuck

95
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:08,030
was a parody sketches.

96
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:08,640
Sure.

97
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,720
Yeah of course.

98
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,990
It doesn't really feel that
way ladies and gentlemen.

99
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,350
The comments on those
are the best parts of it.

100
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:19,070
Got So angry you for those
comments with the yeah.

101
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:20,923
Ooh Man.

102
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,220
Argue back and forth.

103
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,420
It still goes angry,

104
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,553
angry fuck heads.

105
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,520
So the noodles,

106
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,930
so they have these
noodles is treat noodles.

107
00:02:26,931 --> 00:02:27,764
You can get,

108
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,860
I was advised the first day like you
don't want those why show me this video

109
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:31,970
that I can send you right now.

110
00:02:31,971 --> 00:02:32,804
You can put up,

111
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:35,510
but they are here.

112
00:02:35,511 --> 00:02:36,110
Put your,

113
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,910
put your email here and
then just said it to me.

114
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:41,830
You can just send it to yourself.

115
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:42,191
But,

116
00:02:42,191 --> 00:02:43,024
uh,

117
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:44,260
so the get the oil,

118
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:47,380
what they would do is they
would go to the sewer,

119
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:52,150
they would take raw sewage out of
the sewer and then boil it down.

120
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:54,250
The way they'd make wax hash wax,

121
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:57,610
they'd boil off the sewage
and whatever was left.

122
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:01,990
That's cooking oil that they would use.

123
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,730
It's super fucking harmful.

124
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:06,430
And then sell to like a lot
of the street noodle guys.

125
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:07,241
Yeah.

126
00:03:07,241 --> 00:03:09,340
That face is what I made that same face.

127
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,170
They were cooking with sewer oil,

128
00:03:11,171 --> 00:03:12,004
Bro.

129
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:13,660
It was going around.

130
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,300
So it's not common,

131
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,670
but it was possible.

132
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:20,290
So it's not like that's
the only way they do it.

133
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:20,531
No,

134
00:03:20,531 --> 00:03:22,660
but the street places where
like you run a risk here,

135
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,650
it's cheaper oil.

136
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:24,921
All mine.

137
00:03:24,921 --> 00:03:26,220
There's guns on that source.

138
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,490
Oh my God.

139
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:32,380
What does this China's food production
of cost gimme some gutter oil making of

140
00:03:32,381 --> 00:03:32,881
gutter oil.

141
00:03:32,881 --> 00:03:33,641
Give me some volume.

142
00:03:33,641 --> 00:03:34,210
Jamie.

143
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,080
Jesus Christ.

144
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:37,520
It's all in a day's work for this woman.

145
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:42,620
She opens up a manhole cover and
scoops out as much slop as she can.

146
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,630
Delighted by what she finds,

147
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,390
what's how others might view as revolting.

148
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,130
She sees as a bonanza,

149
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:53,480
works in the streets at the
southern Chinese city of Shenzhen,

150
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:55,820
a foot soldier in China,

151
00:03:55,821 --> 00:03:57,860
so called Gutter oil industry.

152
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:05,780
I seriously almost through I just gagged.

153
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:10,310
She says she's made enough money to
build a house for her family back in her

154
00:04:10,311 --> 00:04:10,611
home.

155
00:04:10,611 --> 00:04:12,890
Village miles to the north.

156
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:13,880
People are just awful.

157
00:04:13,881 --> 00:04:16,180
She's scooping out to up.

158
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:21,110
Eventually winds up in a processing plant
like this one where it's combined with

159
00:04:21,111 --> 00:04:22,160
other animal fat.

160
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:24,920
Refuse to create recycled cooking.

161
00:04:24,921 --> 00:04:29,730
Oil Work has put the oil in barrels for
delivery to restaurants and to ordain.

162
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:32,510
How can you eat this?

163
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,560
If you eat it,

164
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,393
it can kill you.

165
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:39,140
Cooking oil has long been a
cherish commodity in China.

166
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,520
What's the frying in a walk is the
mainstay of daily meal preparation.

167
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:48,980
The high profit margins from gutter
oil production of Provan irresistible

168
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:55,060
Chinese experts estimate that one 10th
of China's cooking law is gutter oil,

169
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,860
which has been found
to contain carcinogens.

170
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:00,460
Tell the toxins harmful for humans.

171
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,520
You think shit,

172
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,750
water is bad for you.

173
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:06,890
Breaking news and among
street food vendors.

174
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:12,440
Production sites are often discovered
after people living nearby.

175
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,880
Notice a nauseating stench
and alert your shirt.

176
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,150
Really cooking your food.

177
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:21,870
Police have arrested scores of people
across the country in recent years for

178
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:25,730
engaging in the trade and sees
thousands of tons of the material.

179
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:26,570
Look at these guys.

180
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:30,620
Fake the Chinese drawing
that's shopping a little bit.

181
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:35,540
Fairly harsh penalties for
producers of tainted products.

182
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:41,180
But many consumers doubt that China's
dinner tables can be completely free of

183
00:05:41,181 --> 00:05:42,014
gutter oil.

184
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:46,730
I can do as accepted
in our current society.

185
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:49,040
Everybody tries to swindle everybody else.

186
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:50,530
There's nothing we can do.

187
00:05:50,531 --> 00:05:51,364
A mountain.

188
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:52,843
Wow.

189
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:54,920
Yeah.

190
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,660
That's a false gusting.

191
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:58,310
What that takes discussing

192
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,091
to whole new level.

193
00:05:59,091 --> 00:06:01,940
I have never pouring it from the bucket.

194
00:06:01,941 --> 00:06:02,774
And you hear that.

195
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,350
Go with get that soundbite.

196
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:07,250
No cause that to me I almost threw up.

197
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,260
I had to look away.

198
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,810
That's the first time I've ever
had to look away on a show.

199
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,430
Yeah.

200
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,360
That's amazing.

201
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,520
Cause you knew where I was
headed to someone's food.

202
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,001
Dude.

203
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:18,980
I almost threw up watching that.

204
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:21,980
So I did not have any
of the street noodles.

205
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:24,230
I did have a lot of noodles though.

206
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,820
Oh my gosh.

207
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:27,650
Street noodles mother fucker.

208
00:06:27,651 --> 00:06:28,130
Man.

209
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:29,790
But that you might've had some gutter oil.

210
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:30,624
Absolutely.

211
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,280
I absolutely might hot.

212
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,250
What the fuck man.

213
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,780
I would like to know
if you had got her oil.

214
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:38,750
I probably got to assume when I see that
when it said where it was and like I

215
00:06:38,751 --> 00:06:40,130
probably had some gutter oil.

216
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:43,600
I would like to know how do you think we
could find out when my friend was there

217
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,680
said it was like yeah I'm going
to an eight it for a little while.

218
00:06:45,681 --> 00:06:48,680
You know I got an a kick of eating it
this way before the expos they came out

219
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:54,290
had a lot of diarrhea and it was a lot
cause you're eating shit cause you're

220
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:55,700
eating someone else's shit.

221
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:58,790
That guy we boil it,

222
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:01,820
we put a flame under it is to me,

223
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,740
you know it's like when you,

224
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:06,170
when you see like the worst case scenarios
about China and like then did you

225
00:07:06,171 --> 00:07:09,440
ever see that HBO documentary
about sitting them selling bay?

226
00:07:09,441 --> 00:07:10,274
I think it was HBO.

227
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:14,270
They were selling children like oh like
gosh guys were selling like their two

228
00:07:14,271 --> 00:07:15,130
year old children.

229
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,440
This one boy was screaming cause
his dad sold his brother away.

230
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,160
Whoa.

231
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:19,850
Yeah.

232
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:20,900
Deep Dark Shit.

233
00:07:20,901 --> 00:07:24,140
And they were interviewing the guy
who sold his kid and he was like,

234
00:07:24,141 --> 00:07:24,321
look,

235
00:07:24,321 --> 00:07:25,011
I didn't have any money.

236
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:25,401
I had a kid,

237
00:07:25,401 --> 00:07:26,150
I had us all the kid.

238
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:26,690
Wow.

239
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:27,410
Yeah,

240
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:28,910
it's really fucked up.

241
00:07:28,911 --> 00:07:30,110
I mean really fucked up.

242
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,570
But to me when I see stuff like that,

243
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,880
when I see that guy that was saying that,

244
00:07:34,881 --> 00:07:36,410
you know people swindle people,

245
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:38,750
when you see the whole gutter oil thing,

246
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,250
it's like humanity.

247
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:40,700
If it,

248
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,750
she gets bad.

249
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,410
If people were in a basketball,

250
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:45,340
people go bad,

251
00:07:45,341 --> 00:07:46,280
they go real bad.

252
00:07:46,281 --> 00:07:46,971
They compartmentalize.

253
00:07:46,971 --> 00:07:47,690
They don't like this.

254
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:49,230
I'm not concerned with who gets this.

255
00:07:49,231 --> 00:07:51,230
Like they just don't think about
it like I'm sure it's okay.

256
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,420
That lady was telling me
I have bought a house.

257
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:55,550
You bought a house by feeding people shit.

258
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,790
How much shit did you have
to shovel to get your house?

259
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,120
And you have to continue shoveling
shit in order to pay for that house.

260
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:04,700
I assume they have mortgages over there.

261
00:08:04,701 --> 00:08:05,660
Did they have any mortgages?

262
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:07,370
She's not buying a house with cash,

263
00:08:07,371 --> 00:08:10,760
like showing up big
fucking stack of paper.

264
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:12,040
Oh Dude,

265
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:12,883
that's insane.

266
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:13,903
Critic gross.

267
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,080
That's beyond gross.

268
00:08:15,081 --> 00:08:17,060
I almost threw up on a podcast.

269
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:18,150
I've never done that before.

270
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,030
Like plopping sound to die
hosted fear factor for.

271
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,590
I've seen some shit.

272
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:26,780
I'm not a regular person in that regard.

273
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:31,730
I seen more disgusting shit than almost
any other person who's a comedian.

274
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,223
Yeah.

275
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:38,000
Up Close in person right there and help
people get through eating and I got

276
00:08:38,001 --> 00:08:41,970
nauseous from the smell
the shit scooping it up.

277
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,010
That sound made it started scriptive yeah,

278
00:08:46,011 --> 00:08:47,540
the I really,

279
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:50,000
I got that weird tingle in my throat.

280
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:52,490
I know controller.

281
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,200
Oh,

282
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:55,680
what is horrible.

283
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:56,550
Yeah.

284
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:59,000
Brian Kaplan told me
he was in China and uh,

285
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:02,430
they were at a restaurant
and the restaurant had pigs
underneath the restaurant

286
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:03,990
and running around.

287
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:04,591
Yeah.

288
00:09:04,591 --> 00:09:07,530
They were liking containers underneath
the restaurant and they realized,

289
00:09:07,531 --> 00:09:12,090
his mom asked and to realize that when
you shit the shit was going down to where

290
00:09:12,091 --> 00:09:12,631
the pigs were.

291
00:09:12,631 --> 00:09:13,920
The pigs are eating your shit.

292
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,390
Human Shit.

293
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:17,131
Oh,

294
00:09:17,131 --> 00:09:19,130
gross pigs,

295
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:20,660
mother fucker.

296
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:22,260
That's unfortunate.

297
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:23,760
Shia think,

298
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:24,661
I mean,

299
00:09:24,661 --> 00:09:26,070
and they're doing it old school style.

300
00:09:26,071 --> 00:09:26,970
You're shitting in a hole.

301
00:09:26,971 --> 00:09:30,000
You're squatting like you were talking
about in the first podcast before this

302
00:09:30,001 --> 00:09:31,510
one where you talk about podcasts.

303
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:31,860
We did.

304
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:32,071
Yeah,

305
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,330
we did another podcast couple of,

306
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,353
couple of hours ago.

307
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,230
Um,

308
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:38,250
Ari was talking about how you'd go into
these bathrooms and there's a hole in

309
00:09:38,251 --> 00:09:39,330
the ground that's your toilet.

310
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,280
So underneath that whole pigs,

311
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:42,443
just

312
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:45,560
wait and see the browser.

313
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,450
So fucking great.

314
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,141
But again,

315
00:09:52,141 --> 00:09:53,660
that's what happens when people just get,

316
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:54,600
when it goes bad,

317
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:55,771
play that noise again.

318
00:09:55,771 --> 00:09:56,370
Jamie.

319
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:56,880
Don't do it.

320
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,930
Just play that noise alone.

321
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:58,620
Don't do it.

322
00:09:58,620 --> 00:09:59,453
That's that part.

323
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,230
Just queue it up in case we need all her,

324
00:10:01,231 --> 00:10:02,800
all his cue it up because we did it.

325
00:10:02,801 --> 00:10:03,660
Sounds like I need it.

326
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:04,930
Plop,

327
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:05,150
plop,

328
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:05,341
plop,

329
00:10:05,341 --> 00:10:05,641
plop,

330
00:10:05,641 --> 00:10:05,940
plop.
