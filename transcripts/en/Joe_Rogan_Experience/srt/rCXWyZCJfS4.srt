1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:01,363
Dumb luck.

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:02,611
All right ladies,

3
00:00:02,611 --> 00:00:03,031
gentlemen,

4
00:00:03,031 --> 00:00:03,864
we're live.

5
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:05,011
We're live right now.

6
00:00:05,011 --> 00:00:07,080
If you've never listened to
one of these things before,

7
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:08,610
this is not a regular podcast.

8
00:00:08,611 --> 00:00:13,611
Don't expect some deep insight to the
nature of the universe or even rational

9
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:16,860
conversations because
there's alcohol involved.

10
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:18,030
There might be some weed.

11
00:00:18,031 --> 00:00:18,870
I smoked some weed.

12
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:19,733
I Dunno.

13
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:21,030
There might have been weeding this room.

14
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:21,630
Uh,

15
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:22,500
and uh,

16
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,231
there's a,

17
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:25,050
a bunch of fucking savages to my left.

18
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:25,913
Eddie Bravo,

19
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,370
Eddie the motherfucking twister.

20
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,520
Bravo one of the baddest
dudes on the planet earth.

21
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:30,270
Thank you.

22
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:32,430
One of my favorite human
beings that's ever existed.

23
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:33,960
And Eddie Bravo to his,

24
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:39,170
to his left Justin Milo's trainer
Xtrordinair all throughout the lands.

25
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,600
You could find him on line at the,

26
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:43,463
what does it,

27
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:45,323
personal training.

28
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:48,330
Personal training.com handsome bastard.

29
00:00:48,331 --> 00:00:48,661
Look at them.

30
00:00:48,661 --> 00:00:49,590
Beautiful features,

31
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,520
very polite,

32
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,240
well-read.

33
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,190
Kyla B is in the fucking house.

34
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:54,723
Oh Shit.

35
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:58,080
UFC welterweight prospect bitches

36
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:02,380
fighting Eric Silva in March in Brazil,

37
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,440
going deep into the lion's den.

38
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:04,921
Doot,

39
00:01:04,921 --> 00:01:05,091
doot,

40
00:01:05,091 --> 00:01:05,341
doot,

41
00:01:05,341 --> 00:01:09,330
caveman coffee it all up in this
bitch with the caveman coffee,

42
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:09,720
uh,

43
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,560
to his left,

44
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:13,170
the motherfucking CEO of caveman coffee.

45
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,910
Great Tait Fletcher.

46
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:16,770
Take the animal Fletcher,

47
00:01:16,771 --> 00:01:18,180
take the savage Fletcher,

48
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,710
fill in the blank with the nicknames.

49
00:01:19,711 --> 00:01:20,160
One of the,

50
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:20,551
again,

51
00:01:20,551 --> 00:01:21,480
one of the baddest motherfucker,

52
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:25,740
several of caveman
coffee or I'm more of a,

53
00:01:25,741 --> 00:01:30,741
one of the Fertittas Dana a little bit.

54
00:01:33,811 --> 00:01:35,970
Now he's coming out and
before for us to push him out.

55
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:36,720
Is that what you're saying?

56
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,160
I think he's looking at you and go,

57
00:01:38,161 --> 00:01:39,390
you know what I want to do with taking,

58
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:40,020
dude,

59
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:40,681
he's doing both.

60
00:01:40,681 --> 00:01:41,011
Listen,

61
00:01:41,011 --> 00:01:42,360
go ahead and call me Mister Fertitta.

62
00:01:42,361 --> 00:01:43,110
I'd be happy to help.

63
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:44,580
Tate is always hustling.

64
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,780
Caveman coffee comes in.

65
00:01:45,781 --> 00:01:45,901
Yeah,

66
00:01:45,901 --> 00:01:46,740
we've got a microbrewery.

67
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:48,090
He hands me his fuck a beer.

68
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:48,601
I'm like,

69
00:01:48,601 --> 00:01:48,751
dude,

70
00:01:48,751 --> 00:01:49,650
you're making beer.

71
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,910
This is outrageous.

72
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,880
Has got to work in this
tape is always moving,

73
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:54,930
always moving.

74
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,580
There's no stillness with Tate Fletcher.

75
00:01:56,581 --> 00:01:57,540
You will find no dust.

76
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:00,480
[inaudible] Brendan motherfucking Shaw,

77
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,570
possibly the funniest a UFC
fighter that's ever lived.

78
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:04,860
You might pick.

79
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:06,510
Yeah,

80
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,470
he's made me laugh harder.

81
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:08,400
Don't put,

82
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,490
don't put me in a sauna and
make me fuck my way out.

83
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,590
Is one of the great all time one liners.

84
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:16,680
It's ever been thought a huge
compliment on these podcasts.

85
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:16,951
Yeah,

86
00:02:16,951 --> 00:02:17,750
he's funnier here.

87
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:18,583
Chuck jails,

88
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:21,270
one of the greatest trash
talkers funnier than rampage.

89
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:22,110
Yes.

90
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:22,770
Ooh,

91
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:23,071
yes,

92
00:02:23,071 --> 00:02:23,904
he's fine.

93
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:24,810
You know what?

94
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:25,643
It's close.

95
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:26,491
Close.

96
00:02:26,491 --> 00:02:27,121
But funny though.

97
00:02:27,121 --> 00:02:27,990
He's not on purpose.

98
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,620
Funny.

99
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,230
Well it's also a Quinten
is more irritable.

100
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,750
Like shop's got a smoother personality.

101
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,410
Couldn't get mad if he got out.

102
00:02:35,411 --> 00:02:35,740
Yeah.

103
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:36,530
Yeah.

104
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:37,550
The angry Quinten it,

105
00:02:37,551 --> 00:02:40,560
you know Quinton's always thinking
everybody's ganging up on him.

106
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,350
We're about to watch the fights right now.

107
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:44,040
It's a,

108
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,180
how do you say this gentleman's name?

109
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:46,290
The first fight is,

110
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:50,040
we've got to sync this up so you guys
know we're watching the fights and doing

111
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:51,530
commentary sort of,

112
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:51,960
I mean,

113
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,980
we're not really doing commentary,

114
00:02:52,981 --> 00:02:56,220
but we're watching the fights and
doing a podcast at the same time.

115
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,540
That's the idea behind these.

116
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:58,620
So if you're tuning into it,

117
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,680
if you're listening to it,

118
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:00,160
you might

119
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,870
want to just fucking ditch this one and
go back to one with some scientists.

120
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:05,323
Jolie one,

121
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,210
you can have micro science
says go find Joe Tate Fletcher,

122
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,800
my drop some signs up in this bitch.

123
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:12,761
But,

124
00:03:12,761 --> 00:03:13,060
uh,

125
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:17,630
right now it's a Ray Borg is a
about about to fight this gentleman.

126
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,090
I don't know how to say his name.

127
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:20,320
Give us some volume there.

128
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:21,543
Young Jamie.

129
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,920
Chris Kull ladies set the dude's name.

130
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:32,811
Pow.

131
00:03:32,811 --> 00:03:33,170
Pow.

132
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:33,441
All right.

133
00:03:33,441 --> 00:03:35,720
I'm taking the headphones off
so if shit gets out of control,

134
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:36,733
you've been warned.

135
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,720
Fights starting right now.

136
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:40,221
It's four minutes,

137
00:03:40,221 --> 00:03:42,590
58 seconds if you want
to sync up four minutes.

138
00:03:42,591 --> 00:03:46,160
58 seconds of the first round was on the
clock when I said that Mario Yamasaki

139
00:03:46,161 --> 00:03:47,360
might be fucking mad at her.

140
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:49,270
Right for doing that shit taken his,

141
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:51,200
she still can't see Mario's heart.

142
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:52,400
I can't do that shit.

143
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:53,270
Did the heart that she did it.

144
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,670
It comes out that's been around.

145
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,680
It ain't his.

146
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:57,201
Yeah,

147
00:03:57,201 --> 00:03:57,921
but he does.

148
00:03:57,921 --> 00:03:59,860
He on it for the UFC does.

149
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:00,351
You can't,

150
00:04:00,351 --> 00:04:01,170
you can't do that.

151
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:03,380
That's not going to talk
to that show round forever.

152
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,030
Do that.

153
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,410
Throw that shit on your car.

154
00:04:06,411 --> 00:04:07,244
That means you're gay.

155
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,143
The rainbow,

156
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:10,220
that's different.

157
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:10,401
No,

158
00:04:10,401 --> 00:04:11,181
but for the,

159
00:04:11,181 --> 00:04:12,110
it's a UFC thing.

160
00:04:12,111 --> 00:04:13,070
The camera's on you.

161
00:04:13,071 --> 00:04:13,904
You got your thing.

162
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:14,571
You know,

163
00:04:14,571 --> 00:04:15,770
like the CIC referee,

164
00:04:15,771 --> 00:04:16,850
what's her name with the blonde hair?

165
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:17,511
She goes like this.

166
00:04:17,511 --> 00:04:17,920
She goes,

167
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,753
no.

168
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,100
She goes like both.

169
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,280
But that's box and,

170
00:04:23,281 --> 00:04:23,590
and she,

171
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,430
she could be the mills lane of a MMA,

172
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:25,760
but,

173
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,350
but if you're a octagon girl,

174
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:28,700
you gotta do something right.

175
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,410
You just can't wave y'all do something.

176
00:04:30,411 --> 00:04:31,580
You know what Herb Dean,

177
00:04:31,581 --> 00:04:33,110
he just calls whatever.

178
00:04:33,111 --> 00:04:33,944
He was like,

179
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,113
he doesn't want it.

180
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:36,140
Everyone's like,

181
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,250
cause that's our moment.

182
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:37,971
The referee,

183
00:04:37,971 --> 00:04:40,210
that's their moment where they're
in the spotlight right now.

184
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,210
You're going to do something,

185
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,380
Mario Yamasaki said,

186
00:04:42,381 --> 00:04:42,920
fuck it.

187
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,753
I'm going to spread love.

188
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:45,920
That's my second Mac.

189
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:46,763
I do whatever I want.

190
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:47,750
Bruce Bumper does.

191
00:04:47,751 --> 00:04:49,490
Fucking wheel kicks and shit.

192
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:50,571
You know what I mean?

193
00:04:50,571 --> 00:04:51,890
Why not throw a little little uh,

194
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:52,490
hand size.

195
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:55,940
Never been a guy like Bruce buffer that
you could talk into doing a ThreeSixty

196
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:56,930
pretty agile.

197
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:59,690
He did a three 60 used to do the one 80.

198
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:04,910
We were all sitting there a fucking
three 60 it was the greatest thing ever.

199
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:06,710
We blew his knee out.

200
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:07,341
No,

201
00:05:07,341 --> 00:05:07,461
no,

202
00:05:07,461 --> 00:05:07,611
no.

203
00:05:07,611 --> 00:05:08,720
He blows me out jumping.

204
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:09,973
He was jumping,

205
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:10,311
bro.

206
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:13,820
I've seen him in the gym with
cables doing the Bruce Buffer

207
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:21,130
resistance training and telling you why
he's doing it to fucking staring into

208
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:22,641
the gym.

209
00:05:22,641 --> 00:05:23,590
I hear a commitment,

210
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:26,360
a hybrid in front of everyone,

211
00:05:26,361 --> 00:05:28,340
like oh for sure relaxed man.

212
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,330
He's doing resistant bay.

213
00:05:30,331 --> 00:05:30,800
You know what?

214
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,040
I bet a little spot for sure.

215
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:34,980
It'd be took a little cup of water and
that would help as well cause he's Kinda

216
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,930
doing copper wire.

217
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,011
So meanwhile,

218
00:05:37,011 --> 00:05:41,810
not to be disrespectful to these gentlemen
that are engaging in mortal combat

219
00:05:41,811 --> 00:05:42,644
right now.

220
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,190
Homeboy on top was a minus
1000 when's the last time saw?

221
00:05:46,191 --> 00:05:48,140
It might it's 1000 what does that mean?

222
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,040
That means a,

223
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:53,690
he's a heavy favorite
to win the fight heavy,

224
00:05:53,691 --> 00:05:53,961
heavy.

225
00:05:53,961 --> 00:05:57,230
Favorite 1000 is like 10 to one right?

226
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:57,800
Is that what he was?

227
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,790
Who made these odds?

228
00:05:58,940 --> 00:05:59,773
Sean Shelby.

229
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:00,891
I Dunno.

230
00:06:00,891 --> 00:06:01,724
It makes it,

231
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,051
he wouldn't know.

232
00:06:03,051 --> 00:06:03,260
Right?

233
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,430
Sometimes they're way off.

234
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:04,760
Dude,

235
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,000
I've,

236
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,210
I like tough to bed.

237
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:10,430
I've hooked Aubrey up a bunch of times
where I was like that line is crazy.

238
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:13,850
Like you got a guy coming
in from somewhere else and
people might not know and

239
00:06:13,851 --> 00:06:15,600
the Vegas guys might have
never seen him fight before.

240
00:06:15,601 --> 00:06:17,570
He like get the fuck
Outta here with this line.

241
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,100
This line is ridiculous.

242
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:20,450
You got to wonder who's making those.

243
00:06:20,451 --> 00:06:20,781
They probably,

244
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:22,160
they're not too educated.

245
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:22,671
Yeah.

246
00:06:22,671 --> 00:06:26,300
Like especially on the undercard is
there's been some ones in the past.

247
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:26,781
Oh,

248
00:06:26,781 --> 00:06:29,270
like when Wonderboy Thompson was fighting

249
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:31,853
was he?

250
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:32,150
No,

251
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:32,811
it wasn't wonderful.

252
00:06:32,811 --> 00:06:33,650
It was another Rick,

253
00:06:33,651 --> 00:06:34,610
really good striker.

254
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:35,840
I'll remember as a punk.

255
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:40,190
And I mentioned Sean Shelby because
not because like he's an idiot.

256
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:40,491
Oh,

257
00:06:40,491 --> 00:06:41,750
I only said that because he would,

258
00:06:41,751 --> 00:06:46,490
he's the only one who would know
the thousand minus a thousand.

259
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,480
Like I don't know these guys,

260
00:06:47,481 --> 00:06:49,090
I would just say it's even right.

261
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:51,950
But if you really know like Sha only
a guy like Shawn shelving studies,

262
00:06:51,951 --> 00:06:53,870
these guys would go do
the bad guy's terrible.

263
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:54,810
And this other guys that are running,

264
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:57,020
who knows everybody.

265
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,670
Everybody in all the records.

266
00:06:58,671 --> 00:06:58,821
Joe.

267
00:06:58,821 --> 00:06:59,654
So Joe Silva,

268
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:00,683
no,

269
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,430
no one knows more about
MMA than Joe Sova Library.

270
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,850
No one knows more about.

271
00:07:04,851 --> 00:07:08,330
Like he might not know
as much about execution,

272
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,770
like how to execute things
are where things are gone.

273
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:18,110
It's that funded as far as how many like
guys who know fighters and know who's

274
00:07:18,321 --> 00:07:19,220
fighting and winning.

275
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,780
Joe Silva knows more than anybody.

276
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,140
No one to make your heart drop more
than when you on your cell phone,

277
00:07:24,141 --> 00:07:25,520
you get a call from Joe Silva.

278
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,080
What does Joe Silva,

279
00:07:27,081 --> 00:07:29,760
cause you know he's only
calling about matchups.

280
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:33,650
He's not comfort anything
right here on the cell phone.

281
00:07:33,651 --> 00:07:33,950
You're like,

282
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,060
oh shit,

283
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,670
he's a smart dude.

284
00:07:37,671 --> 00:07:38,750
And or her heart just start to race.

285
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,370
We can see just so right away sweat.

286
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,910
I've been trying to get Joe's hills on
the podcast for a while and I told them,

287
00:07:43,911 --> 00:07:44,091
I go,

288
00:07:44,091 --> 00:07:44,511
look dude,

289
00:07:44,511 --> 00:07:46,490
how about we just don't talk about MMA?

290
00:07:46,491 --> 00:07:46,701
Just,

291
00:07:46,701 --> 00:07:47,920
we won't even talk about him in May.

292
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:48,460
Right?

293
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,000
Like he's a really smart dude,

294
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,013
but he's,

295
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:51,381
you know,

296
00:07:51,381 --> 00:07:53,160
he's in a position as a match maker.

297
00:07:53,161 --> 00:07:54,260
He has to be very careful.

298
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:55,070
You know,

299
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,560
I can't get them high and
have him talking crazy shit.

300
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:58,400
You know,

301
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,700
people don't have nowhere to live.

302
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,250
I don't know where he lives.

303
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:03,180
I don't know if they want it.

304
00:08:03,181 --> 00:08:04,250
They publicly said,

305
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:05,061
I won't say it,

306
00:08:05,061 --> 00:08:06,350
but I like that guy.

307
00:08:06,351 --> 00:08:07,460
I liked Joe Silva a lot.

308
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:08,780
He's smart as fuck dude.

309
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,760
He gave me a Sam Harris' book
way back in the day before.

310
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,430
Like I'm friends with Sam Harris.

311
00:08:13,431 --> 00:08:14,660
I found out about it through Joe.

312
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:15,591
Joe gave me a book,

313
00:08:15,591 --> 00:08:16,850
letters to a Christian nation.

314
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:17,983
Great Book.

315
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,630
Wouldn't he liked to come on
like with the guy like that?

316
00:08:20,631 --> 00:08:22,700
Just so he could talk
to a guy that he admires

317
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:24,860
triangle.

318
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:25,620
Oh,

319
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:26,660
up right there.

320
00:08:26,661 --> 00:08:27,494
What would

321
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:30,063
suddenly,

322
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:31,610
yeah,

323
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:32,950
that's too late.

324
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:34,693
He's fine.

325
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:35,690
The got let go.

326
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:36,410
It's over.

327
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:37,330
You can tell the guy goes,

328
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,710
oh shit,

329
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:41,773
he's good.

330
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:42,420
You know.

331
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:43,710
You know what impressed me wasn't that.

332
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:45,440
You know what impressed me more than that?

333
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:49,760
Leo Vieira and you in Brazil when
he had locked that went up on you.

334
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:53,810
Why you got to bring up old shit
cause your defense is impeccable.

335
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:54,420
No,

336
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:54,590
no.

337
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:55,140
He almost,

338
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,220
I don't know what I was doing

339
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,770
the deep into what I held my
arm or something like this.

340
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,900
It was whatever it was.

341
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:04,990
I didn't know what I was doing
and I was about to tat he let go.

342
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:06,570
He gave me too much.

343
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,280
My face is purple.

344
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:11,010
It's one of those old like old TV footage.

345
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,020
It looks like an old Muhammad Ali type.

346
00:09:13,021 --> 00:09:13,854
Just old,

347
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:16,650
but you could see my face is
purple where you got to go out.

348
00:09:16,651 --> 00:09:21,651
When I was about to go out there and
then I didn't want to show any weakness,

349
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:26,240
so I stood up really quick and like I
got looking like I was going to shoot,

350
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:27,830
you're going to shoot,

351
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,960
but meanwhile I'm drunk as fuck.

352
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:34,230
He's scared that he's going
to see them that you know,

353
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,730
you just pretend like nothing's wrong.

354
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,410
I was like taking shots and shit.

355
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,460
Never taken a shot in my life and
never taking a shot at in my life.

356
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:44,100
But that's how purple my head was.

357
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,940
Ronda Rousey Cat Zingano

358
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,740
guys a call and I think it's MMA.

359
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:54,630
MMA Junkie Radio,

360
00:09:54,631 --> 00:09:55,890
I think coined it.

361
00:09:55,891 --> 00:10:00,610
They would call it Lilith fair because
the woman main event and a woman combien.

362
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:01,853
Really it is.

363
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,210
There's a co main event,

364
00:10:03,211 --> 00:10:04,440
Holly Holly Holm,

365
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,280
striking Greg Kell paints in the chicken.

366
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:08,900
Put that girl.

367
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,100
Oh Gosh,

368
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:10,741
I want to see that.

369
00:10:10,741 --> 00:10:11,311
Fuck yeah.

370
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:11,820
You know what?

371
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,450
Even though Weidman in
Belfort was that the match,

372
00:10:14,451 --> 00:10:15,284
if there was canceled,

373
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,960
even though that,

374
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,300
that would have been
a great fucking match.

375
00:10:18,301 --> 00:10:20,270
Any match said Weidman in any match.

376
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:21,840
That part is great,

377
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,913
but seriously,

378
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:26,670
I love watching Ronda cause
you know a million percent.

379
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:28,350
She's going to come after.

380
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,313
She's from the,

381
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,600
I think she gets hypnotized,

382
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,463
I think.

383
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,230
I think she's the only one
that's listening to Mike Tyson.

384
00:10:34,231 --> 00:10:35,820
Mike Tyson told everybody,

385
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:37,410
everybody on Howard Stern,

386
00:10:37,411 --> 00:10:38,244
he told everybody,

387
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:42,720
he said custom model was
really into hypnotizing me
at before every one of those

388
00:10:42,721 --> 00:10:44,220
big fights in the day
I was sitting at ties.

389
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,380
He brought in a real witness.

390
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:48,180
He said because the model was actually
an amateur hypnotists himself,

391
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,450
but he brought in a real legit guy before
every fight they hypnotize shit and he

392
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:55,700
stopped getting into ties after customer
don't get its own to hit and tells me

393
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:56,940
how come no one's going shit,

394
00:10:56,941 --> 00:10:57,510
how can learn?

395
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,500
Everyone's getting it straight.

396
00:10:58,501 --> 00:10:59,400
The conditioning coach,

397
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,091
they're going to need it.

398
00:11:00,091 --> 00:11:01,140
You get to coach a wrestling coach,

399
00:11:01,141 --> 00:11:03,580
striking coach and a hypnotist
whose written the test dummies.

400
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:04,350
You know what I mean?

401
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:07,830
It's going to get to that point eventually
when people realize or as Mike Tyson

402
00:11:07,831 --> 00:11:08,790
bat shit crazy.

403
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:09,061
Well,

404
00:11:09,061 --> 00:11:12,870
you know what he said he was
hitting the ties in the locker room,

405
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:17,000
a professional hypnotist before
he went out the next week or what?

406
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,110
Doesn't it make sense?

407
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,800
You have to accept it
like if you're resistant.

408
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:24,900
We know Joe Schilling.

409
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:27,870
Schilling got a hypnotist now.

410
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:29,970
Vinny showtime shoreman.

411
00:11:29,971 --> 00:11:30,570
Who is it?

412
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:31,480
Joe Shelley's upset.

413
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:34,980
Did you see that spinning
back fist right hand?

414
00:11:34,981 --> 00:11:36,480
He dropped that dude with and glory.

415
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:40,410
Just set them up for the
right to perfect timing.

416
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,080
Relaxed cracks him up the open book.

417
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,920
Bam drops the right at the time.

418
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:51,660
Horn glory like a few fights ago
and there was the tournament,

419
00:11:51,661 --> 00:11:52,494
right?

420
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:53,830
You watch those guys,

421
00:11:53,831 --> 00:11:54,370
they're knocked

422
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:55,203
out four,

423
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,320
five times budget Naco that they keep
fighting all through to the finals.

424
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,610
Holy Fuck.

425
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,530
If you knew anything about kickboxing,

426
00:12:02,531 --> 00:12:03,490
listen to this line up.

427
00:12:03,491 --> 00:12:05,710
He fought in one fucking night fight.

428
00:12:05,711 --> 00:12:07,030
Simon Marcus,

429
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,460
who was 39 and Oh,

430
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:10,330
okay.

431
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,340
Who had already knocked
him out in the past.

432
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,370
They go three fucking
round to a dead heat.

433
00:12:15,371 --> 00:12:16,900
So they go to a fourth round.

434
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:21,190
This is the first fight he's got
to fight three times three murders.

435
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:23,440
Knock Simon Marcus out with a right hand,

436
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:26,950
puts them to sleep face
plants cause fucking chaos.

437
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,640
Then he fights Wayne Barrett to
do to also had beat him before.

438
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,140
Beats him by decision.

439
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:33,580
Barrett's a bad motherfucker.

440
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:37,220
Then he goes into the main
event and fights are Levin.

441
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,780
Who's if it shillings not
the best leavens the best.

442
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:41,681
It's like those two.

443
00:12:41,681 --> 00:12:43,680
Cause Schilling had
already beat 11 you know,

444
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:46,010
he dropped him and hit him
with a knee on the way down.

445
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:51,840
A devastating fight for 11 but Schilling
and 11 oh they're like fucking right

446
00:12:52,121 --> 00:12:53,020
there man.

447
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:55,840
I mean eleven's a piece we asked to
fight leaven in the fucking finals.

448
00:12:56,290 --> 00:13:00,610
I mean that's insane for fucking rounds
with Simon [inaudible] Bruce kickboxing.

449
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:01,541
It's same,

450
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:02,260
Huh?

451
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,030
Three times in the night is insane.

452
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:07,120
So someone could easily die
from like something like that.

453
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,890
He's got to stop that and we
were talking about this the time.

454
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:11,951
Yes,

455
00:13:11,951 --> 00:13:12,850
he's doing that now.

456
00:13:12,851 --> 00:13:13,900
This guy Vinny sharp.

457
00:13:13,901 --> 00:13:15,640
Everyone isn't getting hypnotized.

458
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,870
What's going on baby?

459
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,300
I'll call smear about code.

460
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,270
You have,

461
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:24,010
you have heard like Randy couture talk
about the importance of having a sports

462
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:24,844
psychologist.

463
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,510
Maybe that's just a nice way of saying
like maybe Randy couture was hypnotized

464
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,330
because when he came out then
he seemed like he had zero fear.

465
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,730
Randy couture came.

466
00:13:32,731 --> 00:13:34,210
I'll never showed an ounce of fear.

467
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:35,350
My tie thing came out,

468
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:36,610
never showed an ounce of fear.

469
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,110
He came from the ghetto.

470
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:41,410
Granite Catuit came from
white people neighborhoods.

471
00:13:41,411 --> 00:13:42,244
You know what I mean?

472
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,480
People,

473
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,160
you know what I mean?

474
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:49,160
So are you came out with zero theater but
Randy couture had that captain America

475
00:13:49,211 --> 00:13:49,420
added.

476
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:52,570
They made Mike Tyson had that attitude
like I'm gonna fucking Rachel.

477
00:13:52,571 --> 00:13:55,540
Andy said the reason he wasn't
nervous cause he accepted losing.

478
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:55,781
He was like,

479
00:13:55,781 --> 00:13:56,590
I don't care.

480
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:58,270
They make different
white people in Oregon.

481
00:13:58,271 --> 00:13:58,541
Man.

482
00:13:58,541 --> 00:13:59,590
They make different white people.

483
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:00,483
Doris,

484
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:03,931
Eddie,

485
00:14:03,931 --> 00:14:04,471
what's wrong?

486
00:14:04,471 --> 00:14:07,440
What's it doing wrong
here to go clockwise,

487
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:08,371
deepest,

488
00:14:08,371 --> 00:14:09,204
right arm.

489
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:10,470
How do you like to do this?

490
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:11,940
Just so many different
ways to close this off.

491
00:14:11,941 --> 00:14:13,590
How do you like to do a hook?

492
00:14:13,591 --> 00:14:15,150
That top leg with your right leg,

493
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,530
the top leg did left leg,

494
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:20,410
hip champion neckties love the Japanese.

495
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:24,770
The Japanese necktie to me
seems stronger than some guys.

496
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:25,231
Very,

497
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:26,580
very hard to choke out.

498
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:27,480
They have like large,

499
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,110
uh,

500
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:29,730
carotid arteries or whatever it is.

501
00:14:29,731 --> 00:14:34,200
Maybe more muscle around and some guys
are just hard at Chubb and then you can

502
00:14:34,201 --> 00:14:34,500
be,

503
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,490
have a guy in a dark,

504
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:39,000
I've had guys in dark has full blown
[inaudible] are so burnt I couldn't

505
00:14:39,001 --> 00:14:39,630
squeeze.

506
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,370
I know I'm not going
to be able to tap them.

507
00:14:41,371 --> 00:14:44,310
I'm just holding him there thinking
about my next move and I'm just sitting

508
00:14:44,311 --> 00:14:44,641
there going,

509
00:14:44,641 --> 00:14:47,190
I had zero energy to squeeze this dude.

510
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,091
I can't do it.

511
00:14:48,091 --> 00:14:50,580
I got to graft or like
an arm bar or a calf.

512
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,433
Craig,

513
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,350
oh Louis get teen.

514
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,213
Oh Mountain.

515
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,350
That is the shit when you get a mountain,

516
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,570
when you get gutsy and
then rolls into a mountain.

517
00:14:59,571 --> 00:15:03,100
Gives him that feeling of getting
that gets heat on in the mountain.

518
00:15:03,101 --> 00:15:03,810
It's just so,

519
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:05,540
it's like now bitch,

520
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,920
so substantial.

521
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:08,680
I got Lavard Johnson's,

522
00:15:08,681 --> 00:15:11,270
he palsy for PDS.

523
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,880
I've got him in a Doris
and Doris is my shit.

524
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,413
I had it.

525
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,540
I had it locked up and I was,

526
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:17,871
I was like,

527
00:15:17,871 --> 00:15:17,961
oh,

528
00:15:17,961 --> 00:15:21,230
this one's over and he's going laughing,

529
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:24,320
laughing as it's on and
punching me in the face.

530
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:27,350
Just so much fucking muscle just did not.

531
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,090
It did not.

532
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:28,923
No.

533
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,320
He pissed hot for that fight.

534
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:30,541
Oh,

535
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:32,180
we ain't got cut right after that.

536
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,020
Who's this guy?

537
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:33,860
Lavard Johnson.

538
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,230
Lavard Johnson is not
the most skillful guy,

539
00:15:36,231 --> 00:15:37,010
but let me tell you something.

540
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:41,210
He hits as hard as any human being I've
ever seen hit someone in the heavyweight

541
00:15:41,211 --> 00:15:41,810
division.

542
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:44,600
He hits so fucking hard
when he at Pat Barry,

543
00:15:44,601 --> 00:15:45,020
I was like,

544
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,660
Jesus fucking Christ and Pat Barry.

545
00:15:47,661 --> 00:15:48,740
That was the first guy.

546
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,550
What check Congo was the first guy
to Cayo with him owed Pat Barry.

547
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:56,900
But the Lavar Johnson fight was a little
more shocking to me because I was like,

548
00:15:56,901 --> 00:15:57,111
man,

549
00:15:57,111 --> 00:15:59,060
I thought that Barry would
be able to out technique.

550
00:15:59,061 --> 00:15:59,780
This dude.

551
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:03,740
I thought there would be a lot of that
heavy right leg kick that he throws and

552
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:04,100
you know,

553
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:04,933
Pat Barry was,

554
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,710
you know like a Shane del Rosario fight.

555
00:16:06,711 --> 00:16:09,110
He had good success against
really high level kickboxers.

556
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:09,711
So I was like,

557
00:16:09,711 --> 00:16:10,640
this is going to be a hard on,

558
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,260
but lavar hitch,

559
00:16:12,261 --> 00:16:16,190
so fucking hard upper cut dude.

560
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,080
He's got some life changing,

561
00:16:18,081 --> 00:16:18,914
punching power,

562
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,373
not even close.

563
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,190
He's got that life changing,

564
00:16:22,191 --> 00:16:23,030
punching power.

565
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,300
Just fucking such a meathead.

566
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:27,590
What's that?

567
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:28,210
Who's such a me?

568
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:31,250
The lavar who has bars especially
which car when his due,

569
00:16:31,251 --> 00:16:33,050
he said you're going to get a hypnotist.

570
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:36,020
I might have to man maybe.

571
00:16:36,021 --> 00:16:36,381
Right,

572
00:16:36,381 --> 00:16:36,740
right.

573
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,720
How come more people who are on the shit,

574
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:43,190
my tiny going is telling you he's the
only guy in the history of fighting who

575
00:16:43,191 --> 00:16:47,120
went out there scared the living
bejesus bejesus out of his opponents.

576
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:52,270
No fighter in history had a lineup of
opponents that were visibly terrified in

577
00:16:53,391 --> 00:16:53,780
the rink.

578
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:54,411
Terrified.

579
00:16:54,411 --> 00:16:56,750
All of them I think does Drusen right now.

580
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,840
They're not terrified on fire.

581
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:02,580
I don't think there's going
to be walked out to Trevor.

582
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:06,710
Perfect time or know what you walk
out too with the Katy Perry Song.

583
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:09,620
This rate board is a
good fucking growler man.

584
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,090
This is impressive shit.

585
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,230
Ray Borg is a beast.

586
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:14,590
He's going one sub to the next sub.

587
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:14,901
Yeah,

588
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:15,621
he's a beast,

589
00:17:15,621 --> 00:17:16,100
man.

590
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,150
He's a fucking beast.

591
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,250
And he's like,

592
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:20,870
he's back in aggressively
and he doesn't get tired.

593
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,310
Well,

594
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:22,890
the guy,

595
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:23,780
he's with men,

596
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,610
the guys fighting ca ladies,

597
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:29,810
he's the toughest shit man is that
guys was with stid and assault.

598
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:31,400
I'm impressed.

599
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,120
That mean.

600
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,950
Look that odds right now we know.

601
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:38,780
That's why it's a thousand plus a thousand
minus that and use what's going there

602
00:17:38,781 --> 00:17:40,280
and it's supposed to be a one round.

603
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,313
There

604
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,450
isn't a mighty mouse fight like a minus
a thousand and sometimes he doesn't

605
00:17:45,451 --> 00:17:46,284
finish cars,

606
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:46,740
right?

607
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:46,941
Yeah,

608
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:47,810
but he's also,

609
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:48,261
I mean,

610
00:17:48,261 --> 00:17:48,680
how,

611
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,650
what is he a one 20 fiber did.

612
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,330
Yeah.

613
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:56,220
But he knocked out Benevidez one punch
you don't lose is the craziest punchers

614
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,300
that fucking Linacre kid.

615
00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:01,140
I really wished he could make one 25 they
said he can't fight at one 25 anymore

616
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,350
and he has to fight it.

617
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:07,650
So we're talking about technique now.

618
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:08,820
He's going for the deep half.

619
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:11,580
Look at this rate for cal
strong rate boys grappling.

620
00:18:11,581 --> 00:18:11,791
It is.

621
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:12,624
Look how strong,

622
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:13,740
physically strong,

623
00:18:13,741 --> 00:18:15,360
just totally dominant position.

624
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:19,080
Every position in those transitionary
periods where it Mike tipped the other way

625
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,070
wrong bitch,

626
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:20,993
I'm on you.

627
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:22,410
Plant you down.

628
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,180
He's strong man.

629
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,171
His grappling,

630
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:25,800
his super,

631
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,633
super tight.

632
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,680
It's tight man.

633
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,950
He's kind of like dropping
a shit on your head.

634
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:37,230
Free one standing half guard
hit the Camorra and dope
the head with the left leg

635
00:18:37,231 --> 00:18:37,801
on his back.

636
00:18:37,801 --> 00:18:40,590
She knows that's where
he lives right there.

637
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:43,950
When you transitioned that you kind
of get a free Shin to the face too,

638
00:18:43,951 --> 00:18:44,730
right?

639
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:46,730
It's like the only time we
are allowed to drive my shit.

640
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,753
Dude.

641
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,470
Adam guys,

642
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,350
a good Kamora grip.

643
00:18:52,351 --> 00:18:52,981
If it's solid,

644
00:18:52,981 --> 00:18:55,830
it takes a long time to master
just holding onto that grip.

645
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,020
It's not really about
the Camorra these days.

646
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:01,470
It's more about just getting the
grip to get better positions.

647
00:19:01,471 --> 00:19:02,670
You can get the back from there.

648
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,331
It's hard.

649
00:19:03,331 --> 00:19:04,081
A couple of guys,

650
00:19:04,081 --> 00:19:06,260
but oh tags he did.

651
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:06,660
Oh,

652
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,493
he got,

653
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:08,653
oh fuck.

654
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:09,051
He Yanked,

655
00:19:09,051 --> 00:19:09,884
I should've quick.

656
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,390
As soon as the left arm was free,

657
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,810
he popped it right behind his back.

658
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:13,170
Yeah,

659
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:14,003
very nice.

660
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:14,370
It could be.

661
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:15,720
I'm not saying the cooler is not possible.

662
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,501
Obvious as possible,

663
00:19:16,501 --> 00:19:17,850
but it's Ah,

664
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:20,640
generally now it's an art in itself.

665
00:19:20,641 --> 00:19:25,641
You can put a whole DDB out on jumping
on a Cora grip in every position and how

666
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:29,430
do improve your position?

667
00:19:29,431 --> 00:19:30,181
How to sweep,

668
00:19:30,181 --> 00:19:31,130
how to get that back on.

669
00:19:31,131 --> 00:19:32,250
I turned it into arm bar,

670
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,121
how to do this,

671
00:19:33,121 --> 00:19:34,800
how to turn it into a leg lock.

672
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:35,630
Boom.

673
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:36,560
She was to come on.

674
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:38,870
It's a whole style on itself.

675
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:39,840
That could be,

676
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,820
it could be it's own style.

677
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:42,210
Really.

678
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:43,043
Just Bam,

679
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:47,670
xe that there's that free Shin Mean Shit.

680
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,000
He get drunk.

681
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,040
My shit phase so hard to get
that arm out at that point.

682
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:53,610
Yup.

683
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:54,630
Here he gets it right here.

684
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,350
Hey,

685
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:59,280
how close was a Havi to catching
Gary Tonin in the camera?

686
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:01,480
Uh,

687
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:02,341
I don't remember that.

688
00:20:02,341 --> 00:20:03,540
He had him in a corner very,

689
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,030
very briefly in the opening
moments of the fight.

690
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,420
He a attack with the
Camorra and Gary told him,

691
00:20:09,421 --> 00:20:10,440
wound up getting out of it.

692
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:13,320
But like you guys are speculating.

693
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:17,460
I was watching the tub watching
little stream in the tub.

694
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,240
Um,

695
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:18,640
they were,

696
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,730
you guys were speculating whether or not,

697
00:20:20,731 --> 00:20:21,340
um,

698
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:21,630
uh,

699
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:22,570
Havi would uh,

700
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:25,020
go after something quick
and like right away he,

701
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:25,390
you know,

702
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:25,530
they,

703
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:30,330
they tied up or right away hot hobby
tried to lock up Komora I don't remember

704
00:20:30,331 --> 00:20:31,164
that I remember it.

705
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,011
So he caught him,

706
00:20:32,011 --> 00:20:32,311
see it.

707
00:20:32,311 --> 00:20:32,581
Gary,

708
00:20:32,581 --> 00:20:34,290
John and caught him with
a triangle is beautiful.

709
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:36,410
Very telling him is on five beautiful.

710
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:38,360
The triangles,

711
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,800
just beautiful the way
he took it from the side.

712
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:41,663
How long,

713
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:43,290
how much time did you catch it?

714
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:44,550
It took about 10 minutes,

715
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:45,540
maybe less.

716
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:45,780
No,

717
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:46,890
maybe less than 10 minutes.

718
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,590
And it didn't,

719
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:48,430
it was a really,

720
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:51,190
really high paced batch
hobby could easily,

721
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,380
he was telling me that
he was going to take,

722
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:54,700
uh,

723
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:55,360
Gary Tone.

724
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:00,340
And then into deep waters cause hobbies
known for his cardio and that's like his

725
00:21:00,341 --> 00:21:00,791
style.

726
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:01,810
He likes to wear her out.

727
00:21:01,811 --> 00:21:02,380
It's like,

728
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,040
you know,

729
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,740
he trains with Henna and here on the
lot that I like to wear a dudes out.

730
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,130
Yep.

731
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:07,840
And that's what he was telling
me that he was going to do,

732
00:21:07,841 --> 00:21:08,591
but he didn't do that at all.

733
00:21:08,591 --> 00:21:12,640
He went after him ruin after
Gary Tonin but it's so hard.

734
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:15,820
It's so hard to tap out Gary toner.

735
00:21:15,821 --> 00:21:16,750
That's tough.

736
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:17,590
Tough.

737
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:19,000
You know what I was really impressed with?

738
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,130
I mean I was really impressed
with Gary Torrin's triangle,

739
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,030
but hobbies,

740
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,650
defense is insane.

741
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:24,161
Yeah.

742
00:21:24,161 --> 00:21:25,030
He defended all,

743
00:21:25,031 --> 00:21:25,990
Gary told his leg locks.

744
00:21:25,991 --> 00:21:27,170
That's what Gary's known for.

745
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:31,070
Gary's on for known
for leg locks to do it.

746
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:31,691
He said,

747
00:21:31,691 --> 00:21:33,940
I just try with lister and he
says he didn't get near my feet.

748
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,530
It was a real good there.

749
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:36,070
Yeah.

750
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:38,680
He or he already had
amazing leg lock defense.

751
00:21:38,681 --> 00:21:43,440
He trained with Erik Paul send down
at CSW like hobby was very hard,

752
00:21:43,441 --> 00:21:44,240
a leg lock.

753
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,830
I was going to be a
hard thing to do and he,

754
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:52,020
he spent a lot of extra time with leg
locked defense because that's Gary's go to

755
00:21:52,301 --> 00:21:52,541
stuff.

756
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:53,560
But he got kind of a triangle.

757
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,020
Gary.

758
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,000
Tony got all kinds of games.

759
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:55,893
He's got everything.

760
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:56,853
He's got everything.

761
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:58,450
That triangle is so beautiful to,

762
00:21:58,451 --> 00:22:01,360
to set it up on a guy like
Havi from your side like that,

763
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:04,630
lock it in and then just go
through like every step of the way.

764
00:22:04,631 --> 00:22:05,800
It's like hobby couldn't stop it.

765
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:06,220
No,

766
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:06,611
he's just,

767
00:22:06,611 --> 00:22:07,000
he just,

768
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,930
he won his match.

769
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:08,321
Gary.

770
00:22:08,321 --> 00:22:09,820
Title one is matching Polaris.

771
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,040
He beat Marcy and he leg locked him.

772
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:13,130
Uh,

773
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:15,730
before that Metamorris against uh,

774
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,870
Zach Maxwell.

775
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,300
You leg locked him and then before that,

776
00:22:19,301 --> 00:22:21,700
the other metamorris he
did against Kit Dale.

777
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:23,110
Guillotine him.

778
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,760
He's not just leg locks.

779
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:25,960
His leg locks are vicious.

780
00:22:25,961 --> 00:22:27,880
Does he do and Nogi or just g?

781
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:28,680
No,

782
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,960
he doesn't do as well.

783
00:22:29,961 --> 00:22:31,160
And the gay because uh,

784
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,290
he's just not a points guy.

785
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:33,250
It's a whole different game.

786
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:37,120
There's a points style and then
there's a submission only style.

787
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:41,890
Two different completely like the way
you were trained for those tournaments.

788
00:22:41,891 --> 00:22:42,724
It's totally different.

789
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:43,571
There's no,

790
00:22:43,571 --> 00:22:45,010
no one gives a shit about the points.

791
00:22:45,011 --> 00:22:45,580
Only ones.

792
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:48,820
They don't care if it's points only
and it doesn't go to a submission.

793
00:22:48,821 --> 00:22:51,160
It just feels like it
feels kind of fucked up.

794
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,470
But when you're watching these
fights like these fights,

795
00:22:53,471 --> 00:22:54,460
integration nationals,

796
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,660
the Gracie nationals,

797
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:56,131
dude,

798
00:22:56,131 --> 00:22:59,020
those were fucking exciting and shit
cause you knew someone's getting tapped.

799
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:01,100
Then Abi,

800
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:05,580
there's the best tournament ever made
to these kind of tournaments goes on

801
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:06,423
submission only.

802
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,433
All that stuff.

803
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:11,860
Gary told him Ubi three March 22nd Sunday,

804
00:23:11,861 --> 00:23:14,320
March 22nd at the Orpheum theater.

805
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:17,740
It's going to be on butoh videos.com
it's going to be the first one that we do

806
00:23:17,741 --> 00:23:20,450
on purpose is a different one
than it is a whole new book.

807
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:22,300
There's the Orpheum was where
they film American idol.

808
00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:23,134
We got hooked up.

809
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:24,950
We got what time is it times ago.

810
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:28,520
We start with doors open at two
and we're going to start at four.

811
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:29,403
It's on a Sunday.

812
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:31,930
I've got marked the comedy
and Magic Club at seven well,

813
00:23:31,931 --> 00:23:32,690
I miss everything.

814
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:34,870
I miss the main show till 11 at night.

815
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:35,700
No,

816
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,970
you'll get your kitchen good.

817
00:23:36,971 --> 00:23:37,780
You could catch it.

818
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,070
You might not get to the end,

819
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:41,620
but it's not going to be
at a 16 man tournament.

820
00:23:41,621 --> 00:23:44,950
Can take an hour and a half or it
could take two hours and a half.

821
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:45,780
It's,

822
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:46,100
it's

823
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,020
like a Badass documentary.

824
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:51,200
Even if you don't know
the first eight matches,

825
00:23:51,201 --> 00:23:52,850
the preliminary is by the
time you get to the finals,

826
00:23:52,851 --> 00:23:54,350
you're going to know those finalists very,

827
00:23:54,351 --> 00:23:55,010
very well,

828
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:57,050
so when you go see a 60 man tournament,

829
00:23:57,530 --> 00:23:59,420
each match one at a time,

830
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:00,770
it really is like a documentary.

831
00:24:00,771 --> 00:24:01,880
It's like UFC too.

832
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:02,803
Remember that Shit.

833
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,660
You got to see it all unfold where
you don't really get to see that much.

834
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:08,330
Where do you get to see that?

835
00:24:08,331 --> 00:24:11,660
Where do you get to see a tournament
unfold like that and Laurie glory.

836
00:24:11,661 --> 00:24:12,590
That crazy fuckers.

837
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,160
Glory.

838
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:13,490
Yes,

839
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:13,881
exactly.

840
00:24:13,881 --> 00:24:14,031
Good.

841
00:24:14,031 --> 00:24:15,530
Was that last insane?

842
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:16,490
Insane.

843
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:18,770
That's the only other place I
think they should stop that.

844
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,633
I really do.

845
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,210
I'm a big Fan of glory.

846
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:22,580
Glory to be successful.

847
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:23,660
You just use different tones.

848
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,533
You can do

849
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:27,260
100% that's very different.

850
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:28,490
I mean for glory.

851
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:32,650
But for a straight kickboxing is,

852
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:34,700
what do you think about that Ben?

853
00:24:34,701 --> 00:24:35,590
You're active fighter.

854
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,490
What do you think about like
pull up that microphone man.

855
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:40,190
What do you think about the
idea of fighting like that?

856
00:24:40,191 --> 00:24:41,080
Like a Gloria event?

857
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:42,200
Like it's Kinda dangerous,

858
00:24:42,201 --> 00:24:42,411
right?

859
00:24:42,411 --> 00:24:43,250
Three times in a night.

860
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,540
I mean it's definitely dangerous,

861
00:24:44,541 --> 00:24:45,231
but it's also,

862
00:24:45,231 --> 00:24:46,070
if you're doing it,

863
00:24:46,071 --> 00:24:47,600
you're doing it as like,

864
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:49,723
that's the,

865
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:54,350
that's the goal is it's so crazy how
many people are really willing to

866
00:24:54,351 --> 00:24:58,730
participate in this and really go try
to become the champion of that night.

867
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:03,260
I mean that's what got me in the fight
and when I saw the UFC back in the day,

868
00:25:03,261 --> 00:25:04,390
it was tournament's.

869
00:25:04,391 --> 00:25:04,840
Yeah.

870
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,140
Tournament's all in one night.

871
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:08,010
It was nuts.

872
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:12,200
There's so much circumstance
and I guess there could be luck.

873
00:25:12,201 --> 00:25:12,561
You know,

874
00:25:12,561 --> 00:25:13,880
you can win with a head kick,

875
00:25:13,881 --> 00:25:14,720
Butt break your foot.

876
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,480
Right now you're going along,

877
00:25:17,481 --> 00:25:17,781
you know,

878
00:25:17,781 --> 00:25:20,200
either of trying to
fight through it or you,

879
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,350
you have to bow out.

880
00:25:21,351 --> 00:25:23,470
And that's like Steve Genom.

881
00:25:23,471 --> 00:25:25,760
Remember when Steve Genom one
cause Hawaii's couldn't go on.

882
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,313
Steve Gentleman,

883
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,690
no one really remembers him.

884
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:33,320
Those new changes versus like the
pride tournament's when it's like

885
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,590
this month they're going to fight,

886
00:25:34,591 --> 00:25:35,760
then we'll have the next thing,

887
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:37,650
but to have it all in one night.

888
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,281
That's the thing,

889
00:25:38,281 --> 00:25:38,990
man.

890
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:39,823
If you're going to do it.

891
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,130
I love the pride style.

892
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:42,560
I think we know price point.

893
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:48,040
I think we know too much about like
getting damaged and then cooling off and

894
00:25:48,041 --> 00:25:49,650
then going back and getting more damaged.

895
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:50,671
We know what that's like.

896
00:25:50,671 --> 00:25:52,500
The ramifications are like multiplied,

897
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,800
like you're getting all these concussions
and then you're going to go and have

898
00:25:55,801 --> 00:25:56,730
another fight.

899
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:58,900
How much are those boys
getting paid over and glory?

900
00:25:58,980 --> 00:25:59,880
That's a good question.

901
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,930
Does anyone know what they did?

902
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:03,530
A great,

903
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:05,820
great zero idea.

904
00:26:05,821 --> 00:26:07,020
I wouldn't want to speculate,

905
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:09,290
but they're walking by a calm,

906
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:14,550
but my take is this could work
because they're on Viacom.

907
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:18,600
They're on fucking spike TV and spike
TV's making Friday night just combat

908
00:26:18,601 --> 00:26:19,300
sports night.

909
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,700
Bella tour one time,

910
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:23,160
kickboxing at a time to
do in golden glory boxing.

911
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:24,143
It's going to be great,

912
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:27,240
but if people just pay attention,

913
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:28,620
Gloria is going to be huge.

914
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,311
It's just one of those,

915
00:26:29,311 --> 00:26:30,150
it can't mess.

916
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:34,020
They just have to do like what the UFC
did is the UFC put the ultimate fighter

917
00:26:34,021 --> 00:26:38,490
together and they spent $44 million in
losses before the ultimate fighter became

918
00:26:38,491 --> 00:26:38,820
a hit.

919
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:40,800
So it was like they were
real close to getting out.

920
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:42,090
Gloria's got to do the same thing.

921
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:43,460
If glory can out how,

922
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:43,980
just

923
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,240
hang in there,

924
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,860
that fucking thing could take off.

925
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:47,970
It's exciting.

926
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,930
It's shit man.

927
00:26:48,931 --> 00:26:49,260
Yeah.

928
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:52,170
I mean everybody wants to
see stand up fighting people.

929
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:56,280
If everybody fought the way Gary tonin
fights or the way Marcella Garcia fights,

930
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,980
people would love to see Nogi Jujitsu too.

931
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,170
Just like people love to see boxing too,

932
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,710
but you want to talk about
like pure excitement,

933
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:07,110
like kickboxing is
right up there with MMA.

934
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:10,590
I mean it's like high level kickboxer
with the best guys are going at it.

935
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:15,390
It's some wild shit goes down that fucking
Raymond Daniels Dude with those wild

936
00:27:15,391 --> 00:27:19,260
three 60 in the air spin kicks
like a fucking video game.

937
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,610
He talks dude's out with
like video game shit.

938
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:23,460
He threw a jumping sidekick.

939
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:27,720
Eddie touched the guy in the chest and
then spun with a spinning back kick to

940
00:27:27,721 --> 00:27:29,160
his face in the air.

941
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,660
It was insane.

942
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:34,140
It was some fucking literally
some video cam shit.

943
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:37,680
Well he was a bad ass point fighter.

944
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:39,240
He was a bad ass points.

945
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:40,074
Herati fighter.

946
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:40,770
I Dunno,

947
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:42,600
it was taekwondo or karate.

948
00:27:42,601 --> 00:27:43,530
I mean whatever it is,

949
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:46,050
the lines are getting
blurry with all those.

950
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:47,131
They're getting real.

951
00:27:47,131 --> 00:27:48,750
The techniques are going to real close.

952
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,890
It's going to be a tough fight,

953
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,180
which Zingano.

954
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:51,661
It's going to be,

955
00:27:51,661 --> 00:27:53,360
it's going to be Rhonda
stuff is challenged,

956
00:27:53,361 --> 00:27:54,870
but I think she'll pass the test.

957
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:56,910
What if you just rip
right through her again?

958
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:57,670
She's just like,

959
00:27:57,670 --> 00:28:01,230
everybody is a new challenge for Ronda
and then she just fucks him all up,

960
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,460
right?

961
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,190
I mean it's probably,

962
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:03,460
well,

963
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,630
it's going to be a crazy fight.

964
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:09,660
I believe I'm here to say that I believe
Rhonda gets hypnotized before she

965
00:28:09,661 --> 00:28:10,494
fights.

966
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,640
I'm just saying.

967
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,030
What'd you clarify those she might,

968
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:13,740
she gets,

969
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:14,573
she comes eyes.

970
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,410
Look at the way she comes up and you know,

971
00:28:16,411 --> 00:28:16,980
uh,

972
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:17,813
um,

973
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:18,450
uh,

974
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:22,500
what's his name is Benson Henderson
road hair catch wrestling.

975
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,131
Judo.

976
00:28:23,131 --> 00:28:23,964
Gene Labelle.

977
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,050
He's old school.

978
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,710
He [inaudible] he probably knows
on a complete new customer model.

979
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,553
They probably hit me.

980
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,380
I'll keep it nice and lessons together.

981
00:28:31,381 --> 00:28:32,760
They got the blue belts together.

982
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:34,463
It hypnotism.

983
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:35,423
Yes.

984
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:37,530
That's the new claimant.

985
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:38,610
Ronda comes out,

986
00:28:38,611 --> 00:28:40,920
she looks like she's on fucking fuck.

987
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:41,843
She comes out

988
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:46,260
with Rhonda so much better
than all these girls.

989
00:28:46,261 --> 00:28:47,850
She could go on a three week binge,

990
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:48,684
no sleep.

991
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:51,760
Do all the coachee wants and
walk in and just destroy these.

992
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:53,910
You want to do whatever
the hell she wants to do.

993
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:54,400
Name,

994
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:54,660
address.

995
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:55,830
Don't throw under the bus.

996
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:56,101
Well,

997
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:56,940
I'm not saying she is.

998
00:28:56,941 --> 00:28:57,930
I'm saying she could.

999
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,280
He wasn't saying that in all right.

1000
00:28:59,281 --> 00:29:00,114
Anyway.

1001
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:02,383
You know what you mean?

1002
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:04,891
You know what man,

1003
00:29:04,891 --> 00:29:06,180
it's really about Cyborg.

1004
00:29:06,181 --> 00:29:09,900
Drop it down to one 35 unless we mean we
don't know man and gone or you look at

1005
00:29:09,901 --> 00:29:12,510
that combination she
finished me should take with,

1006
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:17,570
she's fucking ferocious slow has got
more competition that all those girls

1007
00:29:18,871 --> 00:29:19,590
combined.

1008
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:22,450
So like when she walks up
with that stare like she's,

1009
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,000
she's been down that pole.

1010
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:26,970
She's been walking in that aisle
for fucking years and are striking.

1011
00:29:26,971 --> 00:29:27,850
It's getting good now.

1012
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:30,350
You gotta worry about that shit now.

1013
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,220
Right.

1014
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,200
And touch them.

1015
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,093
She bought there.

1016
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:35,880
She's not the girl every thought she
grounded poner out and then they go,

1017
00:29:35,881 --> 00:29:36,131
oh no,

1018
00:29:36,131 --> 00:29:36,810
what was the need?

1019
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:37,111
Oh No,

1020
00:29:37,111 --> 00:29:38,310
it was the thrill bullshit.

1021
00:29:38,311 --> 00:29:41,980
She hit her and knocked her out and then
need her so quickly and then through

1022
00:29:41,981 --> 00:29:43,690
her before anybody knew she was out.

1023
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,910
She landed that before she does that.

1024
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:47,710
The code.

1025
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:48,101
Who Was it?

1026
00:29:48,101 --> 00:29:51,430
Sarah McMahon that she fucked up with
the meat before that mean Jessamine.

1027
00:29:51,431 --> 00:29:54,400
Duke was telling me weeks before
she's killing what the knee she's,

1028
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,410
she like dropped jasmine
Duke with the knee,

1029
00:29:56,411 --> 00:30:00,130
like in training to jasmine
said she's got crazy needs.

1030
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:01,730
Ron has gotten and I whoa

1031
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:04,323
girls,

1032
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,321
the girls that,

1033
00:30:05,321 --> 00:30:06,154
her friends,

1034
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,650
their roommates and she said she
really wasn't training with them.

1035
00:30:08,651 --> 00:30:09,790
Should beat him up so bad.

1036
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:10,541
The coach was like,

1037
00:30:10,541 --> 00:30:10,711
no,

1038
00:30:10,711 --> 00:30:11,110
we need,

1039
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:12,220
we need dudes up in there.

1040
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,940
We need some fucking dude's.

1041
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:15,700
You imagine though that
the uncommon woman,

1042
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,030
the pressure of that kind
of training all the three,

1043
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,553
come on.

1044
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,800
That's why she's just as an ultra winner.

1045
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:27,910
You know it's going to take another ultra
winter but marina then she tried with

1046
00:30:27,911 --> 00:30:30,130
her still or no shit.

1047
00:30:30,131 --> 00:30:31,360
Your guess is as good as mine.

1048
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,280
You know it'd be bad ass if Ron has said,

1049
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:34,263
you know what,

1050
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:35,920
I don't give a fuck about the steroids.

1051
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:36,890
Let that bitch just,

1052
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:38,510
steroids are still fine.

1053
00:30:38,511 --> 00:30:39,460
Her steroids or not,

1054
00:30:39,461 --> 00:30:41,140
I'm still going to know
or want to say that man.

1055
00:30:41,141 --> 00:30:41,910
You don't want to say that,

1056
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:42,001
hey,

1057
00:30:42,001 --> 00:30:43,690
you need to loss and Gina Carano fight.

1058
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:44,101
Yeah,

1059
00:30:44,101 --> 00:30:45,290
yeah.

1060
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:46,701
Crazy.

1061
00:30:46,701 --> 00:30:47,011
Would it be,

1062
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:50,710
and she said she came out and said that
that would be the most gangster thing

1063
00:30:50,711 --> 00:30:53,830
that CyBorD gene kratos elevator shit.

1064
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:54,551
They was just like,

1065
00:30:54,551 --> 00:30:55,150
dear God,

1066
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:59,590
someone fighters in the UFC are
doing like you have an opponent,

1067
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:02,590
you know the guys roid into the guilty,

1068
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:04,330
but you don't say like,

1069
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:04,901
you know what?

1070
00:31:04,901 --> 00:31:05,810
You don't bring that out,

1071
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,390
can't you just like you accept it.

1072
00:31:07,391 --> 00:31:07,691
You're like,

1073
00:31:07,691 --> 00:31:08,620
of course he is.

1074
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:10,360
Look at the guy we're going to fight.

1075
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:12,190
You don't even bring up the steroids.

1076
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:15,850
A couple of people like Chad Mendez
brought it up or someone brought it up.

1077
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,721
A couple of guys do.

1078
00:31:16,721 --> 00:31:18,400
But you generally,

1079
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:20,020
you know that there's a good,

1080
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,730
there's a good chance that your opponent,

1081
00:31:21,731 --> 00:31:22,870
it's probably on some shit,

1082
00:31:22,871 --> 00:31:23,051
right?

1083
00:31:23,051 --> 00:31:23,231
Yeah,

1084
00:31:23,231 --> 00:31:26,130
but this is a guy can do.

1085
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:30,220
It would be like if you've
got to weigh in from Rogan,

1086
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:30,551
no,

1087
00:31:30,551 --> 00:31:34,090
Yo homeboy homeboy was on
the soft course of course.

1088
00:31:34,091 --> 00:31:35,590
For the line and your mind,

1089
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,420
you're assuming that he probably is.

1090
00:31:37,421 --> 00:31:40,060
Let me prepare for several
who's probably roided right?

1091
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:40,841
Yeah,

1092
00:31:40,841 --> 00:31:41,880
but there's a big difference.

1093
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:46,210
She's someone who's probably roided and
someone like Cyborg who's a girl taking

1094
00:31:46,211 --> 00:31:47,170
male hormones.

1095
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:52,440
That's a different argument is that
she positive tested pas did steroid.

1096
00:31:53,571 --> 00:31:54,550
She'd be huge.

1097
00:31:57,870 --> 00:31:59,560
Let's have the debate right now.

1098
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,473
He's in a while.

1099
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:07,960
You know she looks a lot different now
you're looking at Cyborg now she looks a

1100
00:32:07,961 --> 00:32:08,261
lot like,

1101
00:32:08,261 --> 00:32:09,740
and that's the answer
you give someone else.

1102
00:32:09,741 --> 00:32:10,240
If you do,

1103
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:10,721
you go dude,

1104
00:32:10,721 --> 00:32:12,250
if I did roids that'd be huge.

1105
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:14,860
Right?

1106
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:18,580
You're not denying it or anything
or just you know the real argument.

1107
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,470
You are huge though.

1108
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:21,600
Come on,

1109
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,270
look at me.

1110
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:23,130
Look at me dude.

1111
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:23,973
Look at me.

1112
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:25,810
Think about that.

1113
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:26,860
Thanks for the compliment.

1114
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:30,940
The real argument with a chick like heard
though is that how long was she doing

1115
00:32:30,941 --> 00:32:34,420
at four and did she
permanently alter her physique?

1116
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,793
You know what I'm saying?

1117
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,000
Like when you're introducing,

1118
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:40,430
if you look at like you
ever those women answer

1119
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:40,970
and all that good.

1120
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:41,240
Yeah.

1121
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:41,751
Well those women,

1122
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:42,860
they used to be like Miss Olympia has,

1123
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:46,220
I know one of those ladies and
she just looks different now.

1124
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:50,630
Like she juiced up guaranteed
and she just looks different now.

1125
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:52,580
She's in her fifties now and it's like,

1126
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:53,120
man,

1127
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:53,781
like what do you mean?

1128
00:32:53,781 --> 00:32:56,180
She looks like she thinks
it's pretty obvious.

1129
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:57,890
She did some fucking male hormones.

1130
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,753
What's she doing?

1131
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:00,860
She was Miss Olympia bodybuilding,

1132
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:04,550
bodybuilding or one of those Mr
Olympia or Miss Universe or whatever.

1133
00:33:04,551 --> 00:33:05,384
She wasn't shy.

1134
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:10,250
You those speeds with the big thighs and
you think they do rides with the big,

1135
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,610
I would think that a lot of
professional athletes to steroids.

1136
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:14,750
A lot of damage.

1137
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:19,730
Do you think that since the Lance
Armstrong situation happened,

1138
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:23,180
do you think cyclists are
still doing all that shale?

1139
00:33:23,181 --> 00:33:23,600
Yeah.

1140
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,610
There's nothing changed.

1141
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:24,980
No.

1142
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:25,250
No.

1143
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:25,960
He got busted.

1144
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,670
Nothing part of the game.

1145
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,713
What happened with that?

1146
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:29,211
The next,

1147
00:33:29,211 --> 00:33:34,211
the next guy that didn't piss hot would
have been like the 22nd 15 it was 1515

1148
00:33:34,851 --> 00:33:35,900
to 16 place.

1149
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:42,040
Can you imagine if your 15 mass guy that
didn't piss dirty ever was the 15th guy

1150
00:33:42,921 --> 00:33:44,010
in Toppenish?

1151
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,810
They all his high.

1152
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,560
When you guys think in a certain year,

1153
00:33:51,561 --> 00:33:52,650
one through 14 cause no,

1154
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:52,971
no,

1155
00:33:52,971 --> 00:33:53,121
no,

1156
00:33:53,121 --> 00:33:53,510
no.

1157
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:55,910
He's saying if there's 20 guys that raced,

1158
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,890
15 of them pissed hot,

1159
00:33:58,010 --> 00:34:01,430
the top 15 tests in what year?

1160
00:34:01,431 --> 00:34:02,140
I mean what is that?

1161
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:07,140
Almost every time they always pissed off
they was giving us and they just keep

1162
00:34:07,191 --> 00:34:07,401
going.

1163
00:34:07,401 --> 00:34:09,120
It's essentially a minority sport.

1164
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:10,430
No,

1165
00:34:10,430 --> 00:34:11,090
they do,

1166
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:11,571
but see it to,

1167
00:34:11,571 --> 00:34:13,100
for the longest time people were lying.

1168
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:16,940
They didn't have a sophisticated methods
of determining whether they're on

1169
00:34:16,941 --> 00:34:19,430
certain things and there was
doctors that were involved.

1170
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:21,580
There's a lot of scandalous
shit that's going down.

1171
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:22,723
You had on the podcast,

1172
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:24,590
Kevin lead with it being a teen standing,

1173
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:25,940
getting the guys fighting.

1174
00:34:25,941 --> 00:34:26,631
He's a beast,

1175
00:34:26,631 --> 00:34:27,170
man.

1176
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:29,150
That fucking Zara's.

1177
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:31,130
He's very fucking strong.

1178
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:31,401
Yeah,

1179
00:34:31,401 --> 00:34:33,440
but this guy's a Jujitsu guy on top.

1180
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:33,651
That's,

1181
00:34:33,651 --> 00:34:35,590
I'm telling you he can.

1182
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:40,090
That's a deep guilt to this dude is
getting lost that tell you it's dues.

1183
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:40,933
Getting through that.

1184
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,230
It's a different animal.

1185
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:45,560
Michelle Perez I think possess rather.

1186
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:46,700
Oh Lisa piece,

1187
00:34:46,701 --> 00:34:47,061
dude.

1188
00:34:47,061 --> 00:34:47,760
I'm telling you.

1189
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,100
[inaudible] grappling going,

1190
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:49,551
oh dude,

1191
00:34:49,551 --> 00:34:49,820
he's,

1192
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:50,653
he's a beast.

1193
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:51,980
This guys physically strong.

1194
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,420
He doesn't finish off in,

1195
00:34:53,421 --> 00:34:54,201
in the octagon.

1196
00:34:54,201 --> 00:34:56,450
He's having a hard time
catching guys and stuff.

1197
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:57,880
But it's positioning is,

1198
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,660
this is where you use the grease,

1199
00:34:59,661 --> 00:34:59,851
right?

1200
00:34:59,851 --> 00:35:00,920
If someone's got your back,

1201
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,830
you're getting the tribes
physical strengths and patrols.

1202
00:35:03,831 --> 00:35:04,670
Ridiculous.

1203
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:06,630
Okay.

1204
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:07,141
But you know what?

1205
00:35:07,141 --> 00:35:08,970
Sometimes it takes guys like Damien Maia,

1206
00:35:08,971 --> 00:35:09,151
you know,

1207
00:35:09,151 --> 00:35:11,880
sometimes it takes guys a
few fights to get settled in.

1208
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:13,440
I looked like he just
kissed him on the cheek.

1209
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:16,870
Damien Maia is uh,

1210
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:17,681
is gonna fight.

1211
00:35:17,681 --> 00:35:19,150
I'm Ryan the flair.

1212
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:20,470
The main event.

1213
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:20,860
Yeah.

1214
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:21,940
That's an interesting fight,

1215
00:35:21,941 --> 00:35:22,121
man.

1216
00:35:22,121 --> 00:35:23,610
People don't know how good the flares.

1217
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:24,610
Good.

1218
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:25,510
Killaby yeah.

1219
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:26,140
Yeah.

1220
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:28,560
Same card man who was supposed
to be on the main of that,

1221
00:35:28,561 --> 00:35:30,610
Uriah Faber and,

1222
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:30,971
oh,

1223
00:35:30,971 --> 00:35:31,750
that's right.

1224
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:31,841
Uh,

1225
00:35:31,841 --> 00:35:32,674
Sun's out.

1226
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:34,420
The Sun's how fucked his foot up.

1227
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,710
He broke his ankle.

1228
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:36,351
So now it's your,

1229
00:35:36,351 --> 00:35:38,460
I favor Uriah faber

1230
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:40,080
versus fucking Frankie Edgar

1231
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,020
crazy Philippines,

1232
00:35:43,021 --> 00:35:44,820
Philippines main event
for the Philippines.

1233
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:45,900
Is that a 45?

1234
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:46,763
Yup.

1235
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,633
So gnarly,

1236
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,560
gnarly fight your,

1237
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:52,680
I'd like to ride favor 45 because
he could have all that energy,

1238
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,633
you know,

1239
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:54,400
I mean,

1240
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:54,820
he,

1241
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,670
he cuts to get to one 35.

1242
00:35:56,671 --> 00:35:57,810
I think it's really rough on them.

1243
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:00,090
And I think even especially
as you get older,

1244
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:03,810
it might benefit him to fight one 45
because he's still gonna cut a little,

1245
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:06,690
you know like they're
very similar in size,

1246
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,540
but it might be the
first fight everywhere.

1247
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:09,870
Frankie Edgar's the bigger guy.

1248
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,290
I think every UFC fighter could
learn something from your I favor.

1249
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:17,370
No one's capitalize as far as business
wise opportunity then you're at favor.

1250
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:20,220
These tree though,

1251
00:36:20,221 --> 00:36:24,390
he makes it comes to business
house real estate that he owns.

1252
00:36:24,391 --> 00:36:28,110
The companies that he starts
Torquey sold a k Swiss.

1253
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,220
He's just always,

1254
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:29,970
he's always,

1255
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:32,730
he always has his hand in the pot
as far as just make two torque.

1256
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:33,640
Makes good shit.

1257
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,160
They're the best gloves I've ever used.

1258
00:36:35,161 --> 00:36:35,520
Man.

1259
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:39,060
You have two velcros inside of
them that it zips up really tight.

1260
00:36:39,061 --> 00:36:40,590
It's a super comfortable glove.

1261
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:44,700
Like I have a pair of twins that I
was using and they feel like shit now

1262
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:47,370
compared to the torque torques sweet man.

1263
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:48,360
But I love the twins.

1264
00:36:48,361 --> 00:36:49,200
Twins are nice.

1265
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:49,891
They're good.

1266
00:36:49,891 --> 00:36:51,180
I mean I use them constantly.

1267
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:52,043
I liked him,

1268
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:53,790
but these torques are so good.

1269
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:55,770
Everything they make is good.

1270
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:57,390
Their shit and insteps are great.

1271
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,710
Their gloves are like,

1272
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:01,170
they're like the most comfortable
gloves I've ever put on.

1273
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:02,880
You know what makes really good gloves?

1274
00:37:02,881 --> 00:37:04,440
Too high a Bussa Hi Bruce.

1275
00:37:04,441 --> 00:37:05,274
Dan Makes,

1276
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,090
yeah,

1277
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:06,810
that's those,

1278
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:11,280
those tie pads and we have Justin holds
a tie pads for me and I had all these

1279
00:37:11,281 --> 00:37:13,560
older ones and they fuck his arms up.

1280
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:17,520
But the high boost says man is absorbs
every old widow like those tie gloves.

1281
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,750
When you hit myth,

1282
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:19,710
what do you mean?

1283
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:21,690
Do you wear like winning or any of the,

1284
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:23,460
I word this for punching.

1285
00:37:23,461 --> 00:37:25,140
I wear the fucking torques man.

1286
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:27,810
I don't wear anything but I
have like 80 different gloves.

1287
00:37:27,811 --> 00:37:29,190
I always pick those torques up.

1288
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:30,660
Have you tried those winning gloves?

1289
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:31,441
Yeah,

1290
00:37:31,441 --> 00:37:32,011
I've tried those.

1291
00:37:32,011 --> 00:37:32,730
Those are good.

1292
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:33,420
Yeah.

1293
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:33,631
Yeah.

1294
00:37:33,631 --> 00:37:35,100
I mean there's a lot of good stuff.

1295
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:36,031
You know,

1296
00:37:36,031 --> 00:37:37,800
a lot of people title makes good gloves.

1297
00:37:37,801 --> 00:37:39,120
A lot of people make good gloves,

1298
00:37:39,121 --> 00:37:39,954
but I've really,

1299
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,830
the torque is like,

1300
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:43,230
it's very pliable to like,

1301
00:37:43,231 --> 00:37:44,370
it moves good in your hand,

1302
00:37:44,371 --> 00:37:45,510
you feel like you get a good grip.

1303
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:45,901
For me.

1304
00:37:45,901 --> 00:37:46,950
It's all about risk support.

1305
00:37:46,951 --> 00:37:48,210
Me and my wrists are jacked.

1306
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,340
I sold those Everlast.

1307
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:52,950
Do you take the shit out of him
when you work out like a mother?

1308
00:37:52,951 --> 00:37:53,251
Fuck.

1309
00:37:53,251 --> 00:37:54,780
Do you do exercises?

1310
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,700
Exercises to strengthen it?

1311
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,730
How dare

1312
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:02,893
curls.

1313
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,140
Risk curls are big man.

1314
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:05,910
Don't do anything with a weak link.

1315
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:06,990
Don't address that shit.

1316
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:08,430
Yeah Dude.

1317
00:38:08,431 --> 00:38:12,780
I had a bad wrist for like I had
a bad lit risk for like 10 years.

1318
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:17,190
I fucked up my wrist once and it
never literally never got better.

1319
00:38:17,191 --> 00:38:21,180
I never got an Mri and never found out
what was wrong with it would click like

1320
00:38:21,181 --> 00:38:21,941
no matter what I did,

1321
00:38:21,941 --> 00:38:25,230
it would click and it would be in pain
every time I worked out flight 10 years.

1322
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:26,150
That's me.

1323
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:26,821
But you know what?

1324
00:38:26,821 --> 00:38:31,821
I got prolotherapy I got that prolotherapy
shit where they inject the like they

1325
00:38:31,831 --> 00:38:33,830
stick glucose into your vape,

1326
00:38:33,831 --> 00:38:34,860
your tenants?

1327
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,100
No,

1328
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,680
it's different things like
one of them you do for joints,

1329
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:41,320
like where the tendons are
loose and you have ish dude,

1330
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:42,220
it fixed it.

1331
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:44,770
Like you'd never hear about
something getting fixed.

1332
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:47,020
Like when someone has a
chronic something for 10 years,

1333
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:47,651
it's always like,

1334
00:38:47,651 --> 00:38:47,830
wow,

1335
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:48,041
dude,

1336
00:38:48,041 --> 00:38:49,270
that's some shit you got to deal with,

1337
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:51,340
but no by risk got fixed.

1338
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:55,600
They injected all these these fucking
needles into it hurt like a fuck.

1339
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:56,350
I'm actually the rest.

1340
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:58,720
It feels like fire fire.

1341
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:00,183
It's amazing.

1342
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:02,650
It's sore and then it sore
as fuck and they're like,

1343
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,130
yeah,

1344
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:04,060
no Ibuprofen.

1345
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:05,770
Don't we want the swelling?

1346
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:08,420
Just sit with her for a long tomotherapy.

1347
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:08,681
Yeah.

1348
00:39:08,681 --> 00:39:12,340
What it does is it makes your
tendons physically thicker.

1349
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:16,780
Like it can make it as much as 40%
thicker that the someone knew someone.

1350
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:17,830
I want to say,

1351
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:18,761
I want to say it,

1352
00:39:18,761 --> 00:39:19,930
Scotty from on the Mat,

1353
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:25,110
one of his buddies was getting prolo
on his elbows and his knees just to

1354
00:39:26,351 --> 00:39:28,180
strengthen them from Jiu Jitsu does.

1355
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:28,751
It wasn't even,

1356
00:39:28,751 --> 00:39:32,080
didn't even have an issues was
getting it just injected in.

1357
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:33,190
It's a great idea.

1358
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,220
It literally strengthens your tenants.

1359
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:36,970
It hurt so bad,

1360
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,350
but allegedly,

1361
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:40,420
I mean I wanna I want to
make sure that this is,

1362
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:42,520
you should Google it
before you go out and do.

1363
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:45,760
It was years ago and he
was like a purple belt.

1364
00:39:45,761 --> 00:39:46,594
The John Jocks,

1365
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:49,930
he tweaked his knee in Jujitsu really,

1366
00:39:49,931 --> 00:39:50,764
really bad.

1367
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:55,030
And you immediately call the people
from pro though from John jocks and they

1368
00:39:55,031 --> 00:39:55,510
said,

1369
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:56,290
come on,

1370
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:57,430
come on over now.

1371
00:39:57,730 --> 00:39:58,810
And uh,

1372
00:39:58,811 --> 00:40:00,000
you had your NFX.

1373
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:00,460
Yeah,

1374
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:01,990
and I remember he couldn't drive,

1375
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:06,820
so I had a driver's NSX and I've never
driven a high power sports car before.

1376
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:08,620
So I was kind of like
grinding the gears here,

1377
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,550
here that he was so mad.

1378
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:14,830
He was fucked up and he was

1379
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:18,123
killing,

1380
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:20,530
he was already keyed.

1381
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:22,150
Imagine he's in the worst mood.

1382
00:40:22,151 --> 00:40:23,080
He can be in his knee.

1383
00:40:23,081 --> 00:40:23,914
Just pop.

1384
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:29,200
I'm rushing them to prolotherapy doc
so that we can avoid surgery perhaps.

1385
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:29,830
Right.

1386
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:30,940
And he's so mad at me.

1387
00:40:30,941 --> 00:40:31,774
I'll never forget,

1388
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,060
you can't fucking drive with shit,

1389
00:40:34,061 --> 00:40:34,530
dude.

1390
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:36,190
You're fucking killing my gears.

1391
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,480
What the fuck are you doing?

1392
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,890
He and he was panicking.

1393
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:39,963
I'm like

1394
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:42,790
the pressure slowly.

1395
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:46,180
It's a hard car to drive,

1396
00:40:46,181 --> 00:40:46,720
dude.

1397
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:50,880
You have to practice
six chef cars to drive.

1398
00:40:50,881 --> 00:40:52,480
It's different man could ever drive.

1399
00:40:52,481 --> 00:40:53,500
It's one of the smoothest,

1400
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:54,310
easiest cars.

1401
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:59,310
A Mecca driving is like come on
Nolan for being in a car to drive.

1402
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:02,550
It was very powerful man.

1403
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,540
I had a stick shift,

1404
00:41:04,541 --> 00:41:05,830
Pinto station wagon.

1405
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:06,820
I was used to that shit.

1406
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:10,020
Well the one that you drove was
the best one I ever owned two cars.

1407
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:11,110
It was supercharged.

1408
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:14,260
I put a supercharger on that
one and the prolotherapy.

1409
00:41:14,261 --> 00:41:15,580
This was like 15 years ago,

1410
00:41:15,581 --> 00:41:16,120
man.

1411
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,070
Back then they didn't have
the results they have now.

1412
00:41:18,071 --> 00:41:18,310
Right.

1413
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:19,330
The scientific data.

1414
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:19,810
Well,

1415
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:23,500
what happened to my knee was I had a
bucket handle tear of the meniscus,

1416
00:41:23,501 --> 00:41:25,330
so prolotherapy wouldn't have fixed that.

1417
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,770
I had to get some surgery done.

1418
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:31,310
There was a big opening in the meniscus
where would flip over and lock it would

1419
00:41:31,311 --> 00:41:31,720
like to,

1420
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:34,070
the meniscus was torn and like if my

1421
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:35,390
knee got tweak sideways,

1422
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:35,781
it would,

1423
00:41:35,781 --> 00:41:36,120
the,

1424
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:40,080
the torn part would tuck under and
it would literally lock my leg out.

1425
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:40,993
It was rough,

1426
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:43,490
so they had to go in there and
scoop that shit out and fix it.

1427
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,850
But the prolotherapy is really
good for if you have any,

1428
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:49,640
like they just had to take some of it out.

1429
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:50,660
They'd take some of it out,

1430
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:51,800
but they fixed it.

1431
00:41:51,801 --> 00:41:52,250
I mean,

1432
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:55,190
it gets sore occasionally now,

1433
00:41:55,191 --> 00:41:58,610
but I can do everything with it
then has never needed any surgery.

1434
00:41:58,670 --> 00:41:59,690
He's never been hurt.

1435
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:00,310
Right.

1436
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:01,820
You've never needed any kind of surgery,

1437
00:42:01,821 --> 00:42:02,480
right?

1438
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,201
No blown out.

1439
00:42:03,201 --> 00:42:03,561
Knees.

1440
00:42:03,561 --> 00:42:03,711
No.

1441
00:42:03,711 --> 00:42:04,100
Nothing.

1442
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:04,910
That's amazing.

1443
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:05,361
And how old are,

1444
00:42:05,361 --> 00:42:06,960
you know you're 31 right?

1445
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:10,400
Randy coture when his whole
career with no surgery.

1446
00:42:10,401 --> 00:42:11,240
That's amazing.

1447
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:12,020
Wow.

1448
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:12,853
Amazing.

1449
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:18,000
So this fucking Dude Michelle [inaudible],

1450
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:18,890
he's a beast,

1451
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:19,490
man.

1452
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:20,660
This is a good scrap.

1453
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:21,860
And this Kevin Leakin.

1454
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:23,060
He's fucking good man.

1455
00:42:23,061 --> 00:42:23,894
I've seen him.

1456
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:25,780
I've commented on several of his fights.

1457
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:26,870
A really young kid.

1458
00:42:26,871 --> 00:42:28,130
He's about to switch on them right here.

1459
00:42:28,131 --> 00:42:28,610
Look at this.

1460
00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:29,000
Yeah.

1461
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:29,870
So close.

1462
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:30,870
Damn Nick Sundays,

1463
00:42:30,871 --> 00:42:32,000
big foot and Frank Mir.

1464
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:33,103
Yeah.

1465
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:33,441
Yeah.

1466
00:42:33,441 --> 00:42:34,274
Next Sunday.

1467
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:35,503
Where's that at?

1468
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,530
It's in Brazil.

1469
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:39,210
It's one of the first main events
ever where one guy's own foreign.

1470
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:40,063
The others.

1471
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:41,810
Oh and three in his last three.

1472
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,273
Yeah.

1473
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,690
They crucial fight for both of them.

1474
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:46,311
Well,

1475
00:42:46,311 --> 00:42:47,360
it's a weird fight,

1476
00:42:47,361 --> 00:42:48,194
you know,

1477
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:48,981
it's a good fight.

1478
00:42:48,981 --> 00:42:49,814
Really?

1479
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:51,411
Yeah.

1480
00:42:51,411 --> 00:42:52,610
Frank Mir fan.

1481
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:53,091
Well,

1482
00:42:53,091 --> 00:42:55,010
I've always been a frank
Mir fan of that guy,

1483
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:55,993
Frank Mir.

1484
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:58,430
He can't do TRT anymore though.

1485
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:00,630
That's one thing we have joint TRT.

1486
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:01,610
Why not?

1487
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:02,240
They will not them.

1488
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,560
Nobody does TRT anymore.

1489
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:06,230
Big Foot can't do TRT anymore either.

1490
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:08,593
Fighters now,

1491
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:13,160
are they stopping at
with the pee Dee is now,

1492
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:13,550
I mean,

1493
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:14,280
are they stopping?

1494
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,340
Are they really stopping or are
they trying to be more careful?

1495
00:43:16,370 --> 00:43:17,150
Come on.

1496
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:17,983
What do you think?

1497
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,070
Can they really stop?

1498
00:43:19,071 --> 00:43:20,250
Can you really train that hard?

1499
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:22,130
It's been consistent with the pop.

1500
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:25,430
Then they'll just fuck guys
are just figure ways around it.

1501
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:27,470
You gotta wonder.

1502
00:43:27,470 --> 00:43:27,921
It's part.

1503
00:43:27,921 --> 00:43:29,150
It's part of professional sports.

1504
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:31,610
It's not a UFC prompts
professional sports problem.

1505
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:35,090
Just UFC guys get cotton.

1506
00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:36,200
It's bigger.

1507
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:37,550
It makes a bigger scene.

1508
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:39,200
Nfl guys get caught all the time.

1509
00:43:39,201 --> 00:43:39,980
What do you think about it?

1510
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:41,750
We can't talk over each and every year.

1511
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:42,721
Every year.

1512
00:43:42,721 --> 00:43:43,270
NFL,

1513
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:44,103
every year they renew.

1514
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:45,350
Every year there's a year.

1515
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:46,640
There's NFL players.

1516
00:43:46,641 --> 00:43:47,690
They get pop nonstop.

1517
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:48,770
The number,

1518
00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:49,071
the amount.

1519
00:43:49,071 --> 00:43:50,510
How many a year on average?

1520
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:51,620
Way more than the UFC.

1521
00:43:51,621 --> 00:43:53,600
Not even close and granted
there's more players.

1522
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,490
10 15 a year are way more,

1523
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:56,400
probably more,

1524
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,590
more shirt,

1525
00:43:57,591 --> 00:44:00,100
but they don't even announce it or they
don't because it's just what it is.

1526
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:00,770
Let it go.

1527
00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:01,910
Cause they don't have to,

1528
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:03,440
cause the commission's announcing it,

1529
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:07,430
the number one team that got banned the
most had the most players test positive.

1530
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:08,660
And we don't know whether it's,

1531
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:10,580
it could be for a Ad Rock,

1532
00:44:10,581 --> 00:44:11,960
could be for steroids.

1533
00:44:11,961 --> 00:44:12,561
We don't know.

1534
00:44:12,561 --> 00:44:13,580
They don't tell you that.

1535
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:17,840
But the number one team who had the most
players to as positive was the Seattle

1536
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:18,770
Seahawks who won the Superbowl.

1537
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:20,451
Make sense?

1538
00:44:20,451 --> 00:44:20,811
So what,

1539
00:44:20,811 --> 00:44:24,660
why is it the baseball goes in
front of Congress and football,

1540
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:25,461
basketball,

1541
00:44:25,461 --> 00:44:26,360
all these other sports.

1542
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:28,580
It's just a fine or it's
an internal problem.

1543
00:44:28,581 --> 00:44:29,001
Why is it,

1544
00:44:29,001 --> 00:44:29,301
wait a minute,

1545
00:44:29,301 --> 00:44:30,650
didn't the Patriots win the Superbowl?

1546
00:44:30,830 --> 00:44:31,260
My bad.

1547
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:31,890
Yeah.

1548
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:32,310
Last

1549
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:32,800
to get cloud.

1550
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,990
Don't even know my bat last year.

1551
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:42,010
And I love football game.

1552
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:43,240
You know what I'm saying?

1553
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:45,230
No football fanatic one.

1554
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:46,770
The more I got into the UFC that more,

1555
00:44:46,771 --> 00:44:50,160
I stopped watching football and I barely
watch football every now and then I,

1556
00:44:50,350 --> 00:44:50,680
I,

1557
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:51,600
I keep track of it.

1558
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:53,820
I don't give a fuck about
the patriots or the Seahawks,

1559
00:44:53,821 --> 00:44:56,370
but I watched the Superbowl and holy shit,

1560
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:57,090
it was getting hosting.

1561
00:44:57,090 --> 00:44:58,020
Craziest game.

1562
00:44:58,690 --> 00:44:59,523
Yeah,

1563
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:00,743
the end.

1564
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:05,980
And that catch the craziest catch football
history right there at the very end.

1565
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:10,320
It just bounces off.

1566
00:45:10,321 --> 00:45:12,710
The dude's Pauline's still
give you a football man.

1567
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:13,553
I wouldn't think that.

1568
00:45:13,570 --> 00:45:13,810
No,

1569
00:45:13,810 --> 00:45:15,000
the Superbowl was crazy.

1570
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:19,230
And then they threw an interception
right after that and then the games over.

1571
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:19,440
Oh,

1572
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:22,020
how bout the Katy Perry
Rod and the lion part?

1573
00:45:22,110 --> 00:45:23,250
I'm not mad at that either.

1574
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:24,780
I didn't get to see that.

1575
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:28,020
She's a talented chick man.

1576
00:45:28,021 --> 00:45:28,441
I don't care.

1577
00:45:28,441 --> 00:45:29,260
Anybody can say that.

1578
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:32,280
She's pretty and she's very talented.

1579
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,770
I'm not trying to buy
her or music or anything,

1580
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:38,050
but I see that the hook and
the hook in their music.

1581
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:38,511
Okay,

1582
00:45:38,511 --> 00:45:39,330
let me look.

1583
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:40,120
It's pretty good.

1584
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,070
I'm going to try to buy it,

1585
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:41,331
but I,

1586
00:45:41,331 --> 00:45:41,820
I eh,

1587
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:42,330
it's pretty,

1588
00:45:42,330 --> 00:45:45,810
it's better than fucking
according to Twitter,

1589
00:45:45,811 --> 00:45:48,480
she's the most famous per person on earth.

1590
00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:50,430
She has the most followers out of anyone.

1591
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:51,533
Wow.

1592
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:52,261
I can't even tell,

1593
00:45:52,261 --> 00:45:55,340
Ya know way more than
like a Kim Kardashian.

1594
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:57,601
Come on.

1595
00:45:57,601 --> 00:45:59,790
I don't know more than Obama.

1596
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:03,400
What do you think she has Twitter?

1597
00:46:03,790 --> 00:46:06,450
What do you say he went 39 the site.

1598
00:46:06,790 --> 00:46:07,680
It's like prices,

1599
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:08,514
right?

1600
00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:11,520
42 42 42 what'd he say?

1601
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:16,050
56 65 woo.

1602
00:46:16,850 --> 00:46:18,210
This bitch has 65

1603
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:20,671
I'm not even going to look.

1604
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:21,504
How about that

1605
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:23,773
fucker?

1606
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:25,223
Bullshit.

1607
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,760
28 Kim k's at 28 step your game up,

1608
00:46:29,761 --> 00:46:32,400
Kim k come on.

1609
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:33,720
Well one of them as talent.

1610
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:35,080
Yeah,

1611
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:35,913
it's true.

1612
00:46:36,570 --> 00:46:38,090
I mean you can't be mad at Kim k though.

1613
00:46:38,110 --> 00:46:39,030
Zero talent.

1614
00:46:39,031 --> 00:46:40,230
Just killing the game.

1615
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:42,093
Mean

1616
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:43,411
Game.

1617
00:46:43,411 --> 00:46:44,550
What game is that?

1618
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:45,413
The game mode

1619
00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:48,323
ass son

1620
00:46:49,830 --> 00:46:50,663
wearing a diaper.

1621
00:46:51,230 --> 00:46:52,080
You have respect for her.

1622
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:53,820
She's got a diaper on to respect.

1623
00:46:53,850 --> 00:46:56,490
I respect for her mom and the family.

1624
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:56,971
Oh,

1625
00:46:56,971 --> 00:46:57,521
nice to that.

1626
00:46:57,521 --> 00:46:57,790
Fuck.

1627
00:46:57,790 --> 00:46:59,490
What about meat for this?

1628
00:47:00,170 --> 00:47:02,310
Is Bruce Jenner really
turning into a chair?

1629
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:06,030
100% a hundred percent in
Joe [inaudible] on the show.

1630
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:06,864
And you,

1631
00:47:06,970 --> 00:47:07,630
when you look at that,

1632
00:47:07,630 --> 00:47:08,463
right?

1633
00:47:08,850 --> 00:47:09,980
Like there's this template

1634
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:13,240
because I mean how many times

1635
00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:16,380
one of those daughters,

1636
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:18,150
we always do that.

1637
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:19,590
Hey,

1638
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:20,970
we're talking over each other again.

1639
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,770
I know we're not
listening to the headsets,

1640
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:24,810
but one of those daughters Instagrams,

1641
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:26,580
they have a picture.

1642
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:30,820
I love my dad so much and
he looks like her mom is,

1643
00:47:30,821 --> 00:47:31,630
it is real.

1644
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:33,260
It's totally Bruce Jenner gun,

1645
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,290
a car wreck and he had to tell the,

1646
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:40,360
notify the police that he's taken
hormones become a female and he's doing a

1647
00:47:40,361 --> 00:47:40,931
thing on him.

1648
00:47:40,931 --> 00:47:43,470
Follow him around his
transition from male to female.

1649
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:46,300
He had to tell the police
that they were like,

1650
00:47:46,301 --> 00:47:47,230
what's in your system?

1651
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:48,130
Because it got to,

1652
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:50,050
I'm trying to get a set of tits bar.

1653
00:47:50,230 --> 00:47:51,330
God is the owner.

1654
00:47:51,331 --> 00:47:52,164
If he said it that way,

1655
00:47:52,410 --> 00:47:52,670
Yo,

1656
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:56,860
I'm trying to get my badge on.

1657
00:47:56,861 --> 00:47:59,200
You said it tells how to get
some store lots over here.

1658
00:47:59,270 --> 00:48:00,280
What's going on?

1659
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:01,750
I'm feeling a little emotional.

1660
00:48:02,470 --> 00:48:04,440
You know how it is trying
to get a set of test.

1661
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,300
He claims he's not gay.

1662
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:08,461
How crazy is that?

1663
00:48:08,461 --> 00:48:09,260
I know he likes women.

1664
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:10,093
He's a lesbian.

1665
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:11,463
Oh,

1666
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:14,530
I have a whole bit about it in my act.

1667
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:16,480
I can't do it right here though.

1668
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:17,373
Oh Shit.

1669
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:17,591
Look,

1670
00:48:17,591 --> 00:48:18,550
they're standing in front of each other.

1671
00:48:18,551 --> 00:48:19,720
Kevin Lee's talking shit.

1672
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:21,070
Bazaaris getting tired.

1673
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:22,571
Oh,

1674
00:48:22,571 --> 00:48:23,980
he's talking swinging.

1675
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:26,980
Well [inaudible] he uses
so much physical energy.

1676
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:29,560
You got to remember it's
in Denver tile altitude.

1677
00:48:30,870 --> 00:48:33,580
Remember when Elton John Elton
John didn't fully come out?

1678
00:48:33,581 --> 00:48:34,570
He came out halfway first.

1679
00:48:34,571 --> 00:48:37,750
He said he was by shit 10 Kevin.

1680
00:48:38,130 --> 00:48:40,120
Kevin Channel was like too much at once.

1681
00:48:40,121 --> 00:48:40,780
It's like,

1682
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:42,340
I want to be a woman and I'm gang.

1683
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:44,890
I think he's going to tell
people he's gay and 10 years,

1684
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:45,970
I think Bruce Jenner just,

1685
00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:48,280
he wants me to pay Kim k
and the rest of the family.

1686
00:48:48,281 --> 00:48:48,521
He's like,

1687
00:48:48,521 --> 00:48:48,731
dude,

1688
00:48:48,731 --> 00:48:49,660
this is ridiculous.

1689
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:50,830
She started dating guys.

1690
00:48:50,831 --> 00:48:52,450
You're going to start
seeing him after a while.

1691
00:48:52,451 --> 00:48:57,451
He's going to get busted with a
guy and then that's kind of guy.

1692
00:48:57,730 --> 00:48:59,110
I defended that dude too,

1693
00:48:59,111 --> 00:48:59,944
man.

1694
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:01,533
Boy was I off.

1695
00:49:02,050 --> 00:49:03,910
I bet it was a conspiracy theory at first,

1696
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:04,853
right?

1697
00:49:07,950 --> 00:49:09,220
Brian cal broke the nose.

1698
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:14,430
He had a friend who was painting the house
count's gonna kill me for telling the

1699
00:49:14,431 --> 00:49:14,710
story.

1700
00:49:14,710 --> 00:49:15,960
He had a friend for painting the house.

1701
00:49:15,970 --> 00:49:16,380
The story.

1702
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:18,280
Then that's how we work.

1703
00:49:18,870 --> 00:49:19,703
I'll get over it.

1704
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:21,770
I

1705
00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:24,670
was painting their house.

1706
00:49:24,671 --> 00:49:25,840
Don't say what he did.

1707
00:49:25,841 --> 00:49:27,010
Just say working there,

1708
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:27,910
working there.

1709
00:49:27,911 --> 00:49:29,340
I got another house.

1710
00:49:31,490 --> 00:49:33,530
You're doing do it.

1711
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:37,240
The dudes can be fucking
threw the paint onto the bus.

1712
00:49:37,450 --> 00:49:40,500
Painters sign like nondisclosure
agreements to work in again,

1713
00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:40,791
Peyton,

1714
00:49:40,791 --> 00:49:42,490
those kinds of houses for real.

1715
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:44,530
My guy could really get sued right now.

1716
00:49:44,770 --> 00:49:45,800
Just stop right now.

1717
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:47,010
Kelly might be late.

1718
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:48,430
Knows either way.

1719
00:49:48,431 --> 00:49:50,020
Count that an insight sorts.

1720
00:49:50,021 --> 00:49:51,250
Also known as a snitch.

1721
00:49:51,251 --> 00:49:52,084
Too late.

1722
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:56,013
It's too late.

1723
00:49:56,090 --> 00:49:56,620
It's too late.

1724
00:49:56,620 --> 00:49:57,350
It's already fed.

1725
00:49:57,350 --> 00:49:58,450
The painters fricking.

1726
00:49:58,451 --> 00:49:59,110
He left town.

1727
00:49:59,110 --> 00:49:59,950
It's gun he's got,

1728
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,240
he doesn't have that gig anymore.

1729
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:02,133
And then what happened?

1730
00:50:02,230 --> 00:50:03,080
So Brian Kelly,

1731
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:03,933
how did he know?

1732
00:50:05,490 --> 00:50:06,251
Saw wigs,

1733
00:50:06,251 --> 00:50:08,230
all like full man sized dresses,

1734
00:50:08,231 --> 00:50:11,760
all sorts of stuff with his name on it.

1735
00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:15,940
That sounds like the most
unlikely story ever dressed

1736
00:50:19,470 --> 00:50:20,650
out for a drink with them as well.

1737
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:22,253
What's his house?

1738
00:50:24,370 --> 00:50:25,360
Look at this Kevin Lee.

1739
00:50:25,361 --> 00:50:26,194
Man.

1740
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:28,010
It's this preservice dude's getting

1741
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:31,430
tired and Kevin Lee's not
Kevin Lee's all over a man.

1742
00:50:33,570 --> 00:50:37,080
He hit him with some fucking sick
elbows to the head of the clench too.

1743
00:50:37,650 --> 00:50:38,101
He's all right.

1744
00:50:38,101 --> 00:50:38,934
Look at him.

1745
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:40,250
He's just,

1746
00:50:41,310 --> 00:50:44,550
do you think it'll take on a
new name that nobody's done?

1747
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:46,080
That his lungs are dying.

1748
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:46,980
He's just given up,

1749
00:50:46,981 --> 00:50:47,340
right?

1750
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:49,290
Do you think the Bruce Jenner
will take on a new name?

1751
00:50:49,350 --> 00:50:50,183
Hell No.

1752
00:50:50,190 --> 00:50:50,431
Hey,

1753
00:50:50,431 --> 00:50:52,620
could there be a more
manly named them burrows?

1754
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:53,483
No kidding.

1755
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:55,920
It's like the gay name.

1756
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:59,100
It's like the game is just gangster.

1757
00:50:59,101 --> 00:51:00,720
Bruce Bruce Lee.

1758
00:51:00,750 --> 00:51:01,800
Bruce Lee is not gay.

1759
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:03,013
Hmm.

1760
00:51:03,970 --> 00:51:05,040
Bruce is not gay.

1761
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:06,070
No,

1762
00:51:06,070 --> 00:51:07,320
he's certainly not.

1763
00:51:09,030 --> 00:51:10,470
Certainly everyone got all serious.

1764
00:51:10,471 --> 00:51:12,370
Hell no man.

1765
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:13,891
Look at this.

1766
00:51:13,891 --> 00:51:15,180
It's going for that shit.

1767
00:51:15,181 --> 00:51:15,900
No,

1768
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:17,670
he's going for that leg
log with the legs crossed.

1769
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:18,271
Oh Shit.

1770
00:51:18,271 --> 00:51:20,340
Kevin Lee's trying to
form a real naked choke.

1771
00:51:20,341 --> 00:51:20,791
Look at this.

1772
00:51:20,791 --> 00:51:21,624
This is crazy.

1773
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:23,010
Crushing that jaw right now.

1774
00:51:23,011 --> 00:51:25,340
He's got this dude's back
because Pizarros got tired.

1775
00:51:25,590 --> 00:51:26,430
He's going to do it.

1776
00:51:28,130 --> 00:51:29,370
Oh Damn,

1777
00:51:29,371 --> 00:51:30,030
man.

1778
00:51:30,030 --> 00:51:30,391
No Way.

1779
00:51:30,391 --> 00:51:31,171
The Brazilian one,

1780
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:31,800
right?

1781
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:31,901
Oh,

1782
00:51:31,901 --> 00:51:32,760
is that guy resilient?

1783
00:51:32,850 --> 00:51:33,530
Yeah.

1784
00:51:33,530 --> 00:51:34,090
He just ended up

1785
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:34,923
fight on that note.

1786
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:40,210
Did that guy is tired of muscular.

1787
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:41,890
Yeah,

1788
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:42,940
he's tired as fuck.

1789
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:46,931
Yeah.

1790
00:51:46,931 --> 00:51:49,450
You would think that like if he
does transition to beat a woman,

1791
00:51:49,451 --> 00:51:49,900
he's won.

1792
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:51,130
He's going to want to change his name.

1793
00:51:51,730 --> 00:51:52,960
He's not going to stick with Bruce.

1794
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:53,690
What's it?

1795
00:51:53,690 --> 00:51:53,980
How do you,

1796
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:54,221
I mean,

1797
00:51:54,221 --> 00:51:54,971
what do you do man?

1798
00:51:54,971 --> 00:51:57,340
Everyone knows you're fucking
Bruce get changed name.

1799
00:51:57,430 --> 00:51:58,240
Nah.

1800
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:58,870
Yeah man.

1801
00:51:58,870 --> 00:51:59,950
Girls do that all the time.

1802
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:01,360
When they become a woman,

1803
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:02,081
when they were,

1804
00:52:02,081 --> 00:52:05,140
they used to be a man and they
get a sex change that much.

1805
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:06,040
I mean,

1806
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:06,611
I have no idea.

1807
00:52:06,611 --> 00:52:08,980
It must be kind of fun
picking on the whole new name.

1808
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:09,311
You know?

1809
00:52:09,311 --> 00:52:10,240
It's hilarious.

1810
00:52:10,450 --> 00:52:12,730
Once someone has transitioned,

1811
00:52:12,910 --> 00:52:15,130
you're not even supposed to
say they used to be a man.

1812
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:15,630
Yeah,

1813
00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:15,930
you're,

1814
00:52:15,930 --> 00:52:17,980
you're supposed to say
they were always a woman.

1815
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:21,460
Like because they're a woman in their
mind and it's cruel to say that there are

1816
00:52:21,461 --> 00:52:22,300
one time a man,

1817
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:23,860
even if they're a man,

1818
00:52:24,610 --> 00:52:27,070
like it's wrong to state reality,

1819
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:28,210
that they had a penis.

1820
00:52:28,210 --> 00:52:29,200
They function as a man,

1821
00:52:29,230 --> 00:52:31,360
even had sex with women and had babies,

1822
00:52:31,361 --> 00:52:33,010
so you just have to pretend
that never happened,

1823
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:33,281
dude.

1824
00:52:33,281 --> 00:52:37,060
I had a conversation with this woman
and she on Twitter and she actually said

1825
00:52:37,061 --> 00:52:37,781
that I go,

1826
00:52:37,781 --> 00:52:41,860
so he wasn't a man when he had sex
with a woman and got her pregnant,

1827
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:42,790
he wasn't a man.

1828
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:43,151
She goes,

1829
00:52:43,151 --> 00:52:43,600
no,

1830
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:44,470
not even then,

1831
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:45,340
and I'm like,

1832
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:46,001
oh,

1833
00:52:46,001 --> 00:52:46,630
okay.

1834
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:47,460
I think we're done.

1835
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:47,741
Yeah,

1836
00:52:47,741 --> 00:52:48,010
thank you.

1837
00:52:48,010 --> 00:52:48,450
Yeah.

1838
00:52:48,450 --> 00:52:49,060
I think,

1839
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:49,181
well,

1840
00:52:49,181 --> 00:52:50,190
this conversation's over.

1841
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:53,350
This conversation just took
a left turn down la La land.

1842
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:54,730
Like what is that mean?

1843
00:52:54,731 --> 00:52:56,800
A woman fucked a woman
and got her pregnant?

1844
00:52:56,830 --> 00:52:57,670
Is that what you're saying?

1845
00:52:57,970 --> 00:52:58,151
Well,

1846
00:52:58,151 --> 00:52:59,890
it's just she's a woman physically,

1847
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:02,290
but in reality he was a
dude that fuck the woman.

1848
00:53:02,291 --> 00:53:05,590
She's just saying he felt like a woman
even though he's fucking a woman as a

1849
00:53:05,591 --> 00:53:05,830
man.

1850
00:53:05,830 --> 00:53:08,230
You know what the problem
with that kind of logic is?

1851
00:53:08,231 --> 00:53:09,310
If that's the case,

1852
00:53:09,430 --> 00:53:10,330
if you're already a woman,

1853
00:53:10,331 --> 00:53:10,991
you have a penis.

1854
00:53:10,991 --> 00:53:12,100
Keep your God damn penis.

1855
00:53:12,250 --> 00:53:13,030
Okay?

1856
00:53:13,030 --> 00:53:13,863
Keep your balls.

1857
00:53:14,050 --> 00:53:14,580
You heal.

1858
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:15,670
Your body will work better.

1859
00:53:15,910 --> 00:53:16,211
You know,

1860
00:53:16,211 --> 00:53:18,070
like this idea that
you're already a woman.

1861
00:53:18,071 --> 00:53:19,330
If you are already a woman,

1862
00:53:19,331 --> 00:53:22,660
why are you getting the sex change
then you're not already a woman.

1863
00:53:22,870 --> 00:53:23,201
Okay.

1864
00:53:23,201 --> 00:53:24,610
You were a man on point in time.

1865
00:53:24,970 --> 00:53:26,490
You're not helping anybody

1866
00:53:26,490 --> 00:53:30,270
by twisting the reality of the
situation and you're just making it more

1867
00:53:30,271 --> 00:53:31,890
confusing and harder for people to accept.

1868
00:53:31,950 --> 00:53:35,850
I wonder what's tougher to go from
being a man to woman or woman to man.

1869
00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:38,010
I would say the Dick's
going to be challenged.

1870
00:53:38,011 --> 00:53:38,950
I want to see a woman.

1871
00:53:38,951 --> 00:53:39,391
It's a man.

1872
00:53:39,391 --> 00:53:42,930
It's like impossible because they built
dicks out of the inside of pussies.

1873
00:53:43,110 --> 00:53:43,831
What does that look like?

1874
00:53:43,831 --> 00:53:44,560
Can you pull that up?

1875
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:45,393
Jen?

1876
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:46,433
Can you pull it up?

1877
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:50,080
They make dicks out of the
inside of pussy trying to get

1878
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:52,553
in there.

1879
00:53:52,890 --> 00:53:56,460
I don't want to see it like think Jamie.

1880
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:57,500
I think they used fake.

1881
00:53:58,850 --> 00:53:59,730
All right.

1882
00:53:59,790 --> 00:54:00,390
My Ma.

1883
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:01,350
I know one of them.

1884
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:01,621
Yeah.

1885
00:54:01,621 --> 00:54:01,950
Where's that?

1886
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:02,783
Oklahoma.

1887
00:54:02,830 --> 00:54:03,270
Um,

1888
00:54:03,270 --> 00:54:04,380
I know one of 'em.

1889
00:54:04,410 --> 00:54:04,980
Um,

1890
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:09,450
I saw this lady grew a dick on her arm.

1891
00:54:09,451 --> 00:54:10,470
I'm not mad at that at all.

1892
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:10,791
Like,

1893
00:54:10,791 --> 00:54:15,791
does rabbit's ears stretch the skin out
on her arm and created a fake penis?

1894
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:18,600
When,

1895
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:21,450
so when she was transitioning
and becoming a man,

1896
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:22,980
I take a drink of his beer.

1897
00:54:22,981 --> 00:54:23,550
Right.

1898
00:54:23,550 --> 00:54:24,930
And he's looking at you talking,

1899
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:26,960
but I was like waiting
for him to look at me.

1900
00:54:27,270 --> 00:54:28,390
My reaction happen I took,

1901
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:31,000
cause I know in his peripheral
he thought he looked at me with,

1902
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:35,280
well what the fuck?

1903
00:54:35,281 --> 00:54:36,060
It's pretty good.

1904
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:36,893
That's pretty good.

1905
00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:38,520
Eddie's not a beer guy though.

1906
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:40,111
It all tastes the same.

1907
00:54:40,111 --> 00:54:40,351
Yeah,

1908
00:54:40,351 --> 00:54:41,080
I'm more of a right,

1909
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:41,780
right.

1910
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:42,320
I like to,

1911
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:45,480
I couldn't tell the difference between
Miller light and Coors light or anything

1912
00:54:45,481 --> 00:54:45,931
like that.

1913
00:54:45,931 --> 00:54:46,890
Does Kevin Lee get it?

1914
00:54:46,891 --> 00:54:48,300
Skin grafting in his corner.

1915
00:54:48,301 --> 00:54:50,790
Man had some phrase lots and appears.

1916
00:54:51,690 --> 00:54:52,523
Okay.

1917
00:54:54,270 --> 00:54:55,103
Whoa.

1918
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:56,220
Look at Rick James.

1919
00:54:57,170 --> 00:54:58,200
Well it was quiet.

1920
00:54:58,890 --> 00:55:02,700
He's in a lot better shape than last
time I saw him heavenly up in this bitch.

1921
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:05,130
You got leather pants on Rick James does.

1922
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:06,570
They might be leather.

1923
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:08,760
Look at his belt buckle.

1924
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:09,121
It might be,

1925
00:55:09,121 --> 00:55:09,954
God bless him.

1926
00:55:11,430 --> 00:55:12,390
He's stealing the show.

1927
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:13,320
I don't know which one it is.

1928
00:55:13,321 --> 00:55:15,600
Millie or Vanille Kevin.

1929
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:16,941
Oh,

1930
00:55:16,941 --> 00:55:17,721
he's in Denver,

1931
00:55:17,721 --> 00:55:18,260
boy.

1932
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:19,820
That's why he's got such wicked cardio,

1933
00:55:19,821 --> 00:55:20,654
man.

1934
00:55:20,870 --> 00:55:22,550
He's used to that altitude up there.

1935
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:23,413
Yeah.

1936
00:55:23,630 --> 00:55:24,463
Thank you.

1937
00:55:26,570 --> 00:55:27,680
If you're not used to altitude,

1938
00:55:27,681 --> 00:55:28,730
that shit tortures you.

1939
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:32,810
You ever seen Mark Hunt verse
Ben Rothwell at altitude?

1940
00:55:32,870 --> 00:55:33,081
Yeah,

1941
00:55:33,081 --> 00:55:33,450
we're digging.

1942
00:55:33,450 --> 00:55:34,820
I asked Joe Silva fight and Denver,

1943
00:55:34,821 --> 00:55:35,091
he's like,

1944
00:55:35,091 --> 00:55:37,320
we're never having another
heavyweight fight in depth.

1945
00:55:37,321 --> 00:55:38,180
What they did though,

1946
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:39,440
they had even crazier,

1947
00:55:39,441 --> 00:55:41,210
they had a heavyweight
fight in Mexico City.

1948
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:41,740
Yeah.

1949
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:42,830
Whichever pollution.

1950
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:43,280
Yeah.

1951
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:45,380
Higher altitude and Mark Hunt again.

1952
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:47,600
And Marco came in like the day before.

1953
00:55:47,630 --> 00:55:48,070
Yeah.

1954
00:55:48,070 --> 00:55:50,420
You didn't even have
any altitude training.

1955
00:55:50,990 --> 00:55:51,950
300 candles.

1956
00:55:51,951 --> 00:55:52,580
Yup.

1957
00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:53,930
And nobody in his court,

1958
00:55:53,931 --> 00:55:55,130
like he just walked and he's like,

1959
00:55:55,131 --> 00:55:55,964
I'm here.

1960
00:55:56,070 --> 00:55:56,270
Yeah.

1961
00:55:56,270 --> 00:55:59,960
People were worried that it wasn't gonna
be able to make the two 65 said he was

1962
00:55:59,961 --> 00:56:01,910
like three 10 when he got
the call or some shit.

1963
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:04,070
Three ten five,

1964
00:56:04,071 --> 00:56:06,950
10 because even five 10
just probably five nine.

1965
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:07,780
Yeah.

1966
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:10,450
Cardio and weight to make two 65

1967
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:15,150
you don't really want to spend a whole

1968
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:16,350
Kevin Lee's good man.

1969
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:20,130
You put that dude's voice with
his body and then they just don't,

1970
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:22,050
there's no collusion there at all.

1971
00:56:22,051 --> 00:56:22,321
You're like,

1972
00:56:22,321 --> 00:56:23,920
how is Mark Hunt sound like

1973
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:25,150
an English gentleman?

1974
00:56:25,330 --> 00:56:25,571
Yeah,

1975
00:56:25,571 --> 00:56:26,404
right.

1976
00:56:27,270 --> 00:56:28,190
The Dick on his forum.

1977
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:28,781
Hey,

1978
00:56:28,781 --> 00:56:29,830
there's that Dick shot.

1979
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:30,700
They wanted Eddie,

1980
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:31,900
you want those dig pigs?

1981
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:32,920
Can you put it up on the screen?

1982
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:34,830
Was that

1983
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,620
artificial deck like a transgender deck?

1984
00:56:40,290 --> 00:56:41,330
They grew it on his phone,

1985
00:56:41,331 --> 00:56:42,164
right?

1986
00:56:42,220 --> 00:56:43,560
That Dick Dick you put on,

1987
00:56:43,570 --> 00:56:44,500
do they put it on the arm?

1988
00:56:44,830 --> 00:56:47,230
They put it back on his arm
to to get the blood supply.

1989
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:48,131
Keep that shit fresh.

1990
00:56:48,131 --> 00:56:48,964
Keep it healthy.

1991
00:56:49,150 --> 00:56:49,481
I don't think.

1992
00:56:49,481 --> 00:56:50,990
Just put it back where the Gig is.

1993
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:53,110
I got a lot of blood flow down there.

1994
00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:54,013
Gotta wait.

1995
00:56:54,690 --> 00:56:55,490
Gotta wait,

1996
00:56:55,490 --> 00:56:56,080
can you,

1997
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:58,790
can you find that transgender
deck a second girl.

1998
00:56:58,810 --> 00:56:59,351
Don't do it.

1999
00:56:59,351 --> 00:57:00,184
Don't do it.

2000
00:57:00,570 --> 00:57:01,600
She didn't know weird.

2001
00:57:02,270 --> 00:57:04,160
There's probably guys out there that like,

2002
00:57:04,390 --> 00:57:06,730
that's how they get off is we're
going to eat shit after this.

2003
00:57:06,731 --> 00:57:07,210
Man.

2004
00:57:07,210 --> 00:57:08,043
We can't do this.

2005
00:57:11,730 --> 00:57:13,030
There's only so much deeper night.

2006
00:57:13,031 --> 00:57:15,730
Patrick Walsh middleweights next.

2007
00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:17,980
There's so many fighters in the
UFC that I've never seen fight.

2008
00:57:17,981 --> 00:57:21,220
Now did chest dominant eat his victims?

2009
00:57:21,221 --> 00:57:22,054
Cox?

2010
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:23,050
Lots of parts of them.

2011
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:24,000
I think one,

2012
00:57:24,010 --> 00:57:25,180
I think eight one dick.

2013
00:57:25,330 --> 00:57:26,170
He had to eat a lot.

2014
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:28,270
That must have been the main course there.

2015
00:57:28,271 --> 00:57:31,390
Dick Cavett bonem he's going
to chop them up and eat them.

2016
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:33,700
Why ignore the Dick Mouse too fatty.

2017
00:57:33,701 --> 00:57:34,491
That must be the,

2018
00:57:34,491 --> 00:57:35,350
the main course.

2019
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:35,561
Hey,

2020
00:57:35,561 --> 00:57:37,540
look at this for health reasons.

2021
00:57:37,970 --> 00:57:38,330
Jamie,

2022
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:39,250
want to hear what he's saying?

2023
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:43,840
What is he doing with fire?

2024
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:46,330
He does these like numb
church choir thing.

2025
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:47,870
What do you mean he doesn't know?

2026
00:57:47,871 --> 00:57:48,550
He chucks,

2027
00:57:48,550 --> 00:57:49,301
puts it on firing.

2028
00:57:49,301 --> 00:57:52,450
Does a whole show with it when uh,

2029
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:53,320
just on his own.

2030
00:57:53,321 --> 00:57:54,520
When the fuck he wants.

2031
00:57:54,850 --> 00:57:55,060
No,

2032
00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:55,893
not like what he goes.

2033
00:57:56,790 --> 00:57:57,430
No,

2034
00:57:57,430 --> 00:57:58,250
he used to though.

2035
00:57:58,250 --> 00:58:02,770
He used to be a huge driver and so he's
fighting this arena probably 10 times.

2036
00:58:02,830 --> 00:58:05,950
This is where all our fights were in
Denver before we are in the UFC and he

2037
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:10,951
would come out with those flame things
walking out to the cage and just destroy

2038
00:58:10,961 --> 00:58:11,980
some poor kid.

2039
00:58:12,010 --> 00:58:12,250
Yeah.

2040
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:13,210
They let him come out and like,

2041
00:58:13,211 --> 00:58:13,571
yeah,

2042
00:58:13,571 --> 00:58:15,350
Doug was like,

2043
00:58:15,390 --> 00:58:15,820
come out,

2044
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:18,100
you can slip and light people on fire.

2045
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:21,610
It was like a Vegas show up.

2046
00:58:21,690 --> 00:58:23,740
It was like a Vegas show
and he'd walk the lock,

2047
00:58:23,741 --> 00:58:25,630
the gun beat the shit out of someone was,

2048
00:58:25,631 --> 00:58:26,800
he's really that good at it.

2049
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:27,191
Yeah,

2050
00:58:27,191 --> 00:58:28,300
he's dope at it.

2051
00:58:28,390 --> 00:58:28,870
Whoa.

2052
00:58:28,870 --> 00:58:30,220
Like circus performer type.

2053
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:30,611
Yeah,

2054
00:58:30,611 --> 00:58:31,370
he's really good at,

2055
00:58:31,370 --> 00:58:33,520
he's so fast was always
the kid in the gym.

2056
00:58:33,521 --> 00:58:33,881
We were like,

2057
00:58:33,881 --> 00:58:34,220
damn,

2058
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:35,560
this kid ever got his shit together.

2059
00:58:35,561 --> 00:58:36,670
He's in be a monster.

2060
00:58:36,850 --> 00:58:38,980
But he was always at raves and he,

2061
00:58:39,050 --> 00:58:42,100
he didn't believe in Jujitsu
and wrestling and then,

2062
00:58:42,290 --> 00:58:43,840
and you just kept knocking dudes out.

2063
00:58:43,990 --> 00:58:47,260
And then finally he got with [inaudible]
or bowling or the head wrestling coach

2064
00:58:47,261 --> 00:58:48,130
there and all.

2065
00:58:48,131 --> 00:58:51,340
He's been doing his wrestling
and he's a fucking nightmare now.

2066
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:52,300
Nightmare man.

2067
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:53,260
Wow.

2068
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:54,670
Here's a funny story about thatch.

2069
00:58:55,870 --> 00:58:56,560
We used to,

2070
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:58,150
I got Brandon thatch,

2071
00:58:58,180 --> 00:59:00,400
Cody diamond who find the UFC and myself.

2072
00:59:00,550 --> 00:59:02,920
We all work night security at a,

2073
00:59:02,921 --> 00:59:03,460
uh,

2074
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:03,870
uh,

2075
00:59:03,870 --> 00:59:05,710
after hours a nightclub.

2076
00:59:06,070 --> 00:59:06,431
So it was,

2077
00:59:06,431 --> 00:59:07,960
the three of us were security guards.

2078
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:09,820
I'm used to dress up like assholes.

2079
00:59:09,821 --> 00:59:10,900
We had like his base,

2080
00:59:10,901 --> 00:59:12,180
like Shitty Tuxedos.

2081
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:13,270
It was the three of us.

2082
00:59:13,271 --> 00:59:14,590
Nothing ever happened.

2083
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:16,300
Then the one time something happened,

2084
00:59:16,301 --> 00:59:17,950
the boss came up to us and was like,

2085
00:59:17,951 --> 00:59:18,730
Yo man,

2086
00:59:18,730 --> 00:59:20,530
there's this Russian
dude on the dance floor.

2087
00:59:20,531 --> 00:59:21,320
He has a gun,

2088
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:22,160
big ass gun.

2089
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:23,420
He's dancing with these chicks,

2090
00:59:23,421 --> 00:59:23,631
man,

2091
00:59:23,631 --> 00:59:24,890
you guys gotta go handle this.

2092
00:59:25,370 --> 00:59:26,330
So I was like,

2093
00:59:26,331 --> 00:59:28,910
the head guy would've had like
an ear piece and like an asshole.

2094
00:59:28,970 --> 00:59:31,190
So I got Brandon thatch and Cody Donovan.

2095
00:59:31,390 --> 00:59:31,641
I'm like,

2096
00:59:31,641 --> 00:59:32,091
Yo man,

2097
00:59:32,091 --> 00:59:32,570
listen,

2098
00:59:32,570 --> 00:59:33,403
here's the deal.

2099
00:59:33,710 --> 00:59:35,000
Finally we got some action.

2100
00:59:35,330 --> 00:59:35,601
I was like,

2101
00:59:35,601 --> 00:59:36,381
there's this Russian dude.

2102
00:59:36,381 --> 00:59:37,790
He said the biggest
rush and do down there.

2103
00:59:37,980 --> 00:59:38,271
I'm like,

2104
00:59:38,271 --> 00:59:39,440
they want us to kick this,

2105
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:42,200
this dude out and he has a
gun and I'm up that just like,

2106
00:59:42,201 --> 00:59:43,190
what the fuck?

2107
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:43,611
He's like,

2108
00:59:43,611 --> 00:59:43,791
Bro,

2109
00:59:43,791 --> 00:59:44,930
we don't get paid shit.

2110
00:59:44,931 --> 00:59:45,230
I'm like,

2111
00:59:45,230 --> 00:59:45,561
I know,

2112
00:59:45,561 --> 00:59:46,370
I realize that.

2113
00:59:46,370 --> 00:59:46,941
So listen,

2114
00:59:46,941 --> 00:59:47,774
here's the plan.

2115
00:59:48,730 --> 00:59:49,250
I said,

2116
00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:49,881
here's the plan.

2117
00:59:49,881 --> 00:59:50,570
I said,

2118
00:59:50,570 --> 00:59:52,610
I'm going to walk up to
this dude and be like,

2119
00:59:52,611 --> 00:59:53,090
Yo man,

2120
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:53,960
you gotta get Outta here.

2121
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:54,251
I was like,

2122
00:59:54,251 --> 00:59:54,770
Cody,

2123
00:59:54,770 --> 00:59:57,370
Cody at the sign was big as fuck
and he's a black belt in Jujitsu.

2124
00:59:57,470 --> 00:59:57,741
I'm like,

2125
00:59:57,741 --> 00:59:58,550
you're going to grab him.

2126
00:59:58,550 --> 00:59:58,911
This is,

2127
00:59:58,911 --> 01:00:01,720
if he puts up a fucking
kind of fight like Cody,

2128
01:00:01,721 --> 01:00:02,361
you're going to grab him.

2129
01:00:02,361 --> 01:00:06,770
Satch who's just a nasty ass kickboxer
like you ain't kicked him the head and

2130
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:07,521
we're going to take him out,

2131
01:00:07,521 --> 01:00:07,910
man.

2132
01:00:07,910 --> 01:00:08,151
You know,

2133
01:00:08,151 --> 01:00:08,990
we didn't know the rules.

2134
01:00:08,991 --> 01:00:09,824
We didn't know nothing.

2135
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:11,840
We're nervous as fuck.

2136
01:00:11,870 --> 01:00:12,651
Everyone's so nervous.

2137
01:00:12,651 --> 01:00:13,221
I'm sweating.

2138
01:00:13,221 --> 01:00:13,491
I'm like,

2139
01:00:13,491 --> 01:00:14,241
fuck this job.

2140
01:00:14,241 --> 01:00:15,080
This is my last day,

2141
01:00:15,081 --> 01:00:15,914
man.

2142
01:00:15,950 --> 01:00:16,461
So I'm like,

2143
01:00:16,461 --> 01:00:16,671
all right.

2144
01:00:16,671 --> 01:00:17,930
We even like said a prayer.

2145
01:00:17,931 --> 01:00:19,160
No one's really religious,

2146
01:00:19,161 --> 01:00:20,510
but we already kind of said a prayer.

2147
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:21,370
Oh my God.

2148
01:00:21,370 --> 01:00:22,203
Go up

2149
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:24,470
and left that part.

2150
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:24,831
I know,

2151
01:00:24,831 --> 01:00:25,110
right?

2152
01:00:25,110 --> 01:00:27,650
[inaudible]

2153
01:00:27,670 --> 01:00:29,090
makes it way better sweating.

2154
01:00:29,330 --> 01:00:31,190
I go up to the dude so nervous,

2155
01:00:31,191 --> 01:00:32,024
I'm all,

2156
01:00:32,810 --> 01:00:33,740
hey my man,

2157
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:34,851
you ain't my man.

2158
01:00:34,851 --> 01:00:35,900
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

2159
01:00:35,930 --> 01:00:40,190
We see the gun on you and
Cody's behind like knuckle,

2160
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:42,190
like grip and the guy goes vomit.

2161
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:42,890
I go,

2162
01:00:42,890 --> 01:00:43,101
Bro,

2163
01:00:43,101 --> 01:00:43,881
you're going to have to leave me.

2164
01:00:43,881 --> 01:00:45,440
And we saw the gun and you know,

2165
01:00:45,441 --> 01:00:46,280
we don't want to issues.

2166
01:00:46,281 --> 01:00:46,760
He goes,

2167
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:47,750
no problem.

2168
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:49,970
Okay cool man.

2169
01:00:49,971 --> 01:00:50,241
I like,

2170
01:00:50,241 --> 01:00:51,140
everyone's like ready to go.

2171
01:00:51,141 --> 01:00:51,381
He's like,

2172
01:00:51,381 --> 01:00:52,191
no problem.

2173
01:00:52,191 --> 01:00:53,030
Just walks out.

2174
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:53,811
That's it.

2175
01:00:53,811 --> 01:00:55,160
I wish I had a cooler story for you.

2176
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:57,050
But he was like cool and just bounce.

2177
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:01,400
We probably worked another week there
that would lend even more terrifying

2178
01:01:01,401 --> 01:01:03,530
because that sounds like a
real goddamn professional.

2179
01:01:04,050 --> 01:01:05,690
He's not give a fuck.

2180
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:06,141
Yeah.

2181
01:01:06,141 --> 01:01:09,620
I mean he's probably a dude has been
shooting people since the eighth grade and

2182
01:01:09,621 --> 01:01:09,951
he's like,

2183
01:01:09,951 --> 01:01:10,251
oh yeah,

2184
01:01:10,251 --> 01:01:11,330
I know I got to leave now.

2185
01:01:11,330 --> 01:01:12,440
I don't want to go to jail again.

2186
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:13,333
Big Dude.

2187
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:15,260
I got a job later tonight actually.

2188
01:01:15,261 --> 01:01:17,990
I'm gonna need this gun so
I'm just going to go fuck man,

2189
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:21,050
that's actually quick cause I talked
to all the guys in to work in there,

2190
01:01:21,350 --> 01:01:23,810
but we would get out at like
four or five in the morning.

2191
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:26,450
So we thought we could work
at night train during the day,

2192
01:01:26,630 --> 01:01:27,463
but we'd be up to,

2193
01:01:27,530 --> 01:01:31,880
we want to get home like 5:00 AM we'd
practiced to be at like 10:00 AM go there.

2194
01:01:31,881 --> 01:01:33,260
And just get dismantled.

2195
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:37,460
It's Austin and especially the
glory days when we had Rashad Evans,

2196
01:01:37,580 --> 01:01:37,821
Nate,

2197
01:01:37,821 --> 01:01:38,290
Mark Cart,

2198
01:01:38,290 --> 01:01:39,200
Shane Carwyn,

2199
01:01:39,460 --> 01:01:39,920
uh,

2200
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:40,701
Keith Jardeen,

2201
01:01:40,701 --> 01:01:41,870
all those monsters.

2202
01:01:42,020 --> 01:01:43,790
All of them are George Saint Pierre.

2203
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:44,960
Everyone was at our camp.

2204
01:01:45,050 --> 01:01:48,890
You can't have five hours sleep and show
up for that five hours doing some shady

2205
01:01:48,891 --> 01:01:53,891
drugs and shit and not good man
fighting Russians making $4 an hour.

2206
01:01:54,830 --> 01:01:56,180
Russian dudes with guns.

2207
01:01:56,930 --> 01:01:57,800
Genuine Kelly.

2208
01:01:57,980 --> 01:01:59,060
Look Satish to me.

2209
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:01,130
Why is he from,

2210
01:02:05,140 --> 01:02:05,973
okay,

2211
01:02:06,110 --> 01:02:06,800
Texas.

2212
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:10,460
Can I do the Joey voice
with an Irish accent?

2213
01:02:10,490 --> 01:02:11,323
Is that possible?

2214
01:02:11,540 --> 01:02:12,470
I'd have to work on that.

2215
01:02:12,650 --> 01:02:14,000
I wouldn't want to disrespect to art.

2216
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:14,690
Yeah,

2217
01:02:14,690 --> 01:02:15,560
that's a tough one.

2218
01:02:19,150 --> 01:02:19,500
Sure.

2219
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:20,790
I didn't realize so funny.

2220
01:02:20,791 --> 01:02:21,511
Joey Diaz is,

2221
01:02:21,511 --> 01:02:22,020
man,

2222
01:02:22,020 --> 01:02:23,760
you've always told me
we had him on our show.

2223
01:02:23,910 --> 01:02:24,450
Oh Dude,

2224
01:02:24,450 --> 01:02:25,540
fucking no,

2225
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:26,910
there's nobody like him.

2226
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:27,391
No one,

2227
01:02:27,391 --> 01:02:27,611
right?

2228
01:02:27,611 --> 01:02:28,444
Yeah.

2229
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:31,020
How old is Joey?

2230
01:02:31,580 --> 01:02:32,850
We were talking about the fights.

2231
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:34,680
I have no idea.

2232
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:36,210
Four time Olympian

2233
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:42,430
and won wrestling.

2234
01:02:47,530 --> 01:02:48,363
This guy,

2235
01:02:49,220 --> 01:02:50,010
Kelly,

2236
01:02:50,010 --> 01:02:50,751
Daniel Kelly,

2237
01:02:50,751 --> 01:02:53,320
pseudo Olympian for time for time.

2238
01:02:53,321 --> 01:02:54,154
Judy Olympian.

2239
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:58,550
He's got to be around long time.

2240
01:02:58,640 --> 01:02:59,390
Nobody can hear you.

2241
01:02:59,390 --> 01:02:59,750
You're not.

2242
01:02:59,750 --> 01:03:00,740
This is not a microphone on you,

2243
01:03:00,741 --> 01:03:02,720
so when you're talking
it becomes an issue.

2244
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:03,730
Sorry.

2245
01:03:03,730 --> 01:03:04,011
I mean,

2246
01:03:04,011 --> 01:03:05,530
you've got to step up to it.

2247
01:03:05,790 --> 01:03:07,790
You gotta be able to
generate four time Olympian.

2248
01:03:09,740 --> 01:03:09,951
Damn.

2249
01:03:09,951 --> 01:03:10,740
That girl's hot.

2250
01:03:10,740 --> 01:03:11,580
Sue Burns,

2251
01:03:11,590 --> 01:03:11,930
right?

2252
01:03:11,930 --> 01:03:12,770
She's Australian.

2253
01:03:13,430 --> 01:03:14,770
She's that chick that was in,

2254
01:03:14,780 --> 01:03:15,200
uh,

2255
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:16,280
the wolf of Wall Street.

2256
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:17,660
She's so bad.

2257
01:03:17,661 --> 01:03:18,351
Dubin hot.

2258
01:03:18,351 --> 01:03:18,831
Stupid.

2259
01:03:18,831 --> 01:03:19,940
It's frustrating to Rachel.

2260
01:03:19,941 --> 01:03:23,570
Shit's gone down her and will Smith.

2261
01:03:24,470 --> 01:03:25,970
Kapow America.

2262
01:03:26,870 --> 01:03:28,160
The blackening has begun.

2263
01:03:33,170 --> 01:03:34,340
This is a cat woman.

2264
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:36,103
Yeah.

2265
01:03:36,610 --> 01:03:37,730
Well you got the joker in this.

2266
01:03:37,731 --> 01:03:38,564
I might watch it.

2267
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:39,411
Is this a new,

2268
01:03:39,411 --> 01:03:40,370
is this a TV show?

2269
01:03:40,371 --> 01:03:41,800
What is this Gotham son?

2270
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:43,490
Gotham's most sinister.

2271
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:44,353
I don't know.

2272
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:45,433
I don't know about it.

2273
01:03:46,570 --> 01:03:46,760
Well,

2274
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:47,840
as long as you don't know about it

2275
01:03:49,460 --> 01:03:50,293
now

2276
01:03:51,050 --> 01:03:52,990
I've been seeing
commercials for Gotham fall,

2277
01:03:53,210 --> 01:03:55,430
like a prequel or recall.

2278
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:56,570
I'm a prequel.

2279
01:03:56,810 --> 01:03:58,610
I'll give any Batman thing a shot.

2280
01:04:00,140 --> 01:04:03,740
You big foot versus mirror Barboza
versus Johnson and still fight on that

2281
01:04:03,741 --> 01:04:04,574
fucking card.

2282
01:04:04,730 --> 01:04:08,480
That's a wicked fun fight with Michael
Johnson has been out for a bit,

2283
01:04:08,481 --> 01:04:08,790
right?

2284
01:04:08,790 --> 01:04:09,560
You get injured.

2285
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:10,260
Yeah.

2286
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:10,460
Yeah.

2287
01:04:10,460 --> 01:04:11,091
He got injured,

2288
01:04:11,091 --> 01:04:11,301
right?

2289
01:04:11,301 --> 01:04:11,931
You got injured.

2290
01:04:11,931 --> 01:04:12,290
Any law?

2291
01:04:12,290 --> 01:04:13,280
He lost his last one,

2292
01:04:13,281 --> 01:04:14,114
correct?

2293
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:14,750
I don't know.

2294
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:15,980
Pretty sure any got injured.

2295
01:04:16,130 --> 01:04:16,361
Yeah.

2296
01:04:16,361 --> 01:04:17,500
I know he was on a roll.

2297
01:04:17,530 --> 01:04:17,840
Yeah.

2298
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:18,673
And the last one,

2299
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:18,890
yeah.

2300
01:04:18,890 --> 01:04:21,170
I think you might've Lost
Rashad got hurt again.

2301
01:04:21,171 --> 01:04:22,004
You see that?

2302
01:04:22,150 --> 01:04:22,983
Yeah.

2303
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:26,990
They said it didn't accept the
ACL or something like that.

2304
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:28,070
I don't know why.

2305
01:04:28,071 --> 01:04:29,240
You know why that happens?

2306
01:04:29,241 --> 01:04:31,330
I would like to talk to
a surgeon about what,

2307
01:04:31,331 --> 01:04:33,330
what is the issue with Acl,

2308
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:35,900
with a lot of UFC fighters in particular,

2309
01:04:36,140 --> 01:04:38,360
the graphs below or they don't work well.

2310
01:04:38,361 --> 01:04:39,920
A lot of times they use a,

2311
01:04:39,921 --> 01:04:40,754
uh,

2312
01:04:40,970 --> 01:04:42,830
some parts from a cadaver,

2313
01:04:42,831 --> 01:04:43,250
right?

2314
01:04:43,250 --> 01:04:43,551
Yeah.

2315
01:04:43,551 --> 01:04:45,220
Well that's the ones that don't exist.

2316
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:46,870
Sometimes the body rejects it.

2317
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:47,810
I don't think they know.

2318
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:48,950
I think it depends on the body.

2319
01:04:48,951 --> 01:04:49,221
Correct.

2320
01:04:49,221 --> 01:04:51,420
So just like some people
were able to take some,

2321
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:52,520
it does it just like,

2322
01:04:52,521 --> 01:04:53,630
just like Dominick Cruz.

2323
01:04:54,130 --> 01:04:54,800
Right.

2324
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:56,240
But there's also people that like,

2325
01:04:56,300 --> 01:04:56,660
they're,

2326
01:04:56,660 --> 01:05:00,410
they don't give it enough time and they
were already training and they blow it

2327
01:05:00,411 --> 01:05:01,040
out again.

2328
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:02,060
That does happen.

2329
01:05:02,290 --> 01:05:02,590
Of course.

2330
01:05:02,590 --> 01:05:03,423
You now,

2331
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:05,210
I think Ed Herman did that.

2332
01:05:05,330 --> 01:05:06,800
I think other guys have done that too.

2333
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:07,821
You know,

2334
01:05:07,821 --> 01:05:10,670
you don't know when they
say your body rejected it?

2335
01:05:10,700 --> 01:05:11,510
Are you sure?

2336
01:05:11,510 --> 01:05:11,841
I mean,

2337
01:05:11,841 --> 01:05:15,890
I don't know exactly what's going on
because what happens when you do a,

2338
01:05:15,891 --> 01:05:16,340
um,

2339
01:05:16,340 --> 01:05:18,070
a cadaver is

2340
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:22,840
that it's like a scaffolding and
so it's not that cadaver graft.

2341
01:05:22,841 --> 01:05:24,700
It actually becomes your ACL.

2342
01:05:24,940 --> 01:05:29,770
It's like that ACL allows your body to
proliferate new tissue into it until it

2343
01:05:29,771 --> 01:05:30,820
becomes solid again.

2344
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:33,190
But you don't really take the tissue.

2345
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:34,930
It's like it doesn't stay forever.

2346
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:35,381
You know what I'm saying?

2347
01:05:35,381 --> 01:05:35,710
Like this,

2348
01:05:35,710 --> 01:05:38,920
the cadaver graft apparently
as it's been explained to me,

2349
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:43,900
it just acts as a place for your own
tissue to grow livery system for your

2350
01:05:43,901 --> 01:05:47,710
tissue to sort of like a little
bridge so the tendons will grow again.

2351
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:48,580
Yeah.

2352
01:05:48,580 --> 01:05:49,141
Well you,

2353
01:05:49,141 --> 01:05:49,860
you sort of,

2354
01:05:49,860 --> 01:05:50,693
you use,

2355
01:05:50,770 --> 01:05:52,680
it grows in that graft.

2356
01:05:52,970 --> 01:05:53,560
Yeah.

2357
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:55,390
How long ago did he have the surgery?

2358
01:05:55,750 --> 01:05:56,201
I don't know.

2359
01:05:56,201 --> 01:05:56,981
I mean Dominick Cruz,

2360
01:05:56,981 --> 01:06:00,250
I think he did it like in like nine
months after the first surgery.

2361
01:06:00,251 --> 01:06:02,330
He blew it out and then now he,

2362
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:04,480
he blew it out when he blew it out.

2363
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:07,270
He got surgery was rehabbing,

2364
01:06:07,271 --> 01:06:07,961
was training,

2365
01:06:07,961 --> 01:06:09,010
blew it out again,

2366
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:12,040
and then he had to go
through a whole new surgery.

2367
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:12,911
So you know,

2368
01:06:12,911 --> 01:06:14,620
that's why he was out
for almost three years.

2369
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:16,510
Then he just blew out his right knee.

2370
01:06:18,220 --> 01:06:20,080
It wasn't pushed up to your face.

2371
01:06:20,350 --> 01:06:20,890
What are they saying?

2372
01:06:20,890 --> 01:06:25,630
It wasn't properly like the new
one is a totally new injury.

2373
01:06:25,710 --> 01:06:27,280
It's a new [inaudible] all of that.

2374
01:06:27,450 --> 01:06:28,900
But the other one in triple like that,

2375
01:06:28,901 --> 01:06:32,650
like the psychic injury that's there that
he's going to be nervous every shot he

2376
01:06:32,651 --> 01:06:36,220
takes every time there's a court
like that can fuck a dude up.

2377
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:36,521
Yeah,

2378
01:06:36,521 --> 01:06:37,240
it could,

2379
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:41,320
but he bounced back better
than ever last five year later.

2380
01:06:41,470 --> 01:06:42,060
Yeah.

2381
01:06:42,060 --> 01:06:44,640
It's like dudes are moving
at light speed getting,

2382
01:06:44,650 --> 01:06:45,251
you know what I mean?

2383
01:06:45,251 --> 01:06:47,290
The evolution of the sport is so fast,

2384
01:06:47,350 --> 01:06:49,060
so he fucked [inaudible] up though.

2385
01:06:49,061 --> 01:06:50,920
Man Destroys his style,

2386
01:06:50,921 --> 01:06:51,600
his footwork,

2387
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:51,871
man,

2388
01:06:51,871 --> 01:06:56,190
and you need those needs to be that
quick and change the directions.

2389
01:06:57,580 --> 01:06:58,151
Tell you what though,

2390
01:06:58,151 --> 01:06:59,620
the last cruise though,

2391
01:06:59,621 --> 01:07:03,160
he's a beast as far as being
an analyst on UFC tonight.

2392
01:07:03,161 --> 01:07:04,720
He says he is a man.

2393
01:07:04,930 --> 01:07:05,531
He's really,

2394
01:07:05,531 --> 01:07:06,370
really good at though.

2395
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:08,480
He's got the glasses now to let's,

2396
01:07:08,510 --> 01:07:08,980
he did.

2397
01:07:08,980 --> 01:07:10,390
He's really very studious.

2398
01:07:12,220 --> 01:07:13,270
Very studious.

2399
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:17,530
Are they both from the
show or just this guy?

2400
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:18,393
They said both.

2401
01:07:18,790 --> 01:07:19,061
Oh boy.

2402
01:07:19,061 --> 01:07:24,061
Kelly's stone cold 37 she's trying to
do this one was one 85 and one 37 years.

2403
01:07:25,361 --> 01:07:26,940
37 wow.

2404
01:07:26,950 --> 01:07:27,251
I say,

2405
01:07:27,251 --> 01:07:27,671
fuck it.

2406
01:07:27,671 --> 01:07:28,504
Let's do this.

2407
01:07:29,530 --> 01:07:31,780
You've got to be around a
lab a fourth time in Olympia.

2408
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:33,371
Yeah.

2409
01:07:33,371 --> 01:07:34,720
You're not going to be a young chicken.

2410
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:37,001
They said,

2411
01:07:37,001 --> 01:07:37,151
well,

2412
01:07:37,151 --> 01:07:39,580
he's 37 37 and 29

2413
01:07:41,890 --> 01:07:42,850
that's a beautiful beard.

2414
01:07:42,851 --> 01:07:43,684
Tom Johnson,

2415
01:07:44,770 --> 01:07:45,970
who she can do the hog again.

2416
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:47,770
Ooh,

2417
01:07:47,770 --> 01:07:48,530
Ooh,

2418
01:07:48,530 --> 01:07:48,860
Gosh.

2419
01:07:48,860 --> 01:07:49,693
A raise the roof.

2420
01:07:50,830 --> 01:07:52,120
Did she talk to other October?

2421
01:07:52,130 --> 01:07:53,170
You should check this out.

2422
01:07:53,171 --> 01:07:56,130
Get some new shit for not like those
reps is just stick with the same old one.

2423
01:07:56,140 --> 01:07:56,531
I switched.

2424
01:07:56,531 --> 01:07:58,960
You know she's going to try it and she's
going to watch the tapes later and see

2425
01:07:58,961 --> 01:07:59,830
which one was best.

2426
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:01,190
She,

2427
01:08:01,190 --> 01:08:04,180
I think she didn't get clowned for raised
the roof that is on the west coast.

2428
01:08:04,181 --> 01:08:05,014
Shit.

2429
01:08:05,380 --> 01:08:06,790
Dana's going to talk to him for that.

2430
01:08:07,540 --> 01:08:08,373
That'd be bad.

2431
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:11,890
Feet back dancing like
stepped in my office.

2432
01:08:11,891 --> 01:08:13,570
You're fucking fired
for raise the road bore.

2433
01:08:13,580 --> 01:08:13,841
Sorry.

2434
01:08:13,841 --> 01:08:14,860
Is going to text her tonight.

2435
01:08:14,870 --> 01:08:17,050
Launch Kelly,

2436
01:08:22,220 --> 01:08:22,731
look at him.

2437
01:08:22,731 --> 01:08:23,810
He's laughing at him.

2438
01:08:24,230 --> 01:08:24,521
Oh,

2439
01:08:24,521 --> 01:08:25,640
he hit him with a right hand there,

2440
01:08:25,641 --> 01:08:26,350
dude.

2441
01:08:26,350 --> 01:08:27,900
He had him with a little
short right hook there.

2442
01:08:28,180 --> 01:08:30,200
That right hand is low son.

2443
01:08:30,290 --> 01:08:31,011
He's well he's,

2444
01:08:31,011 --> 01:08:34,100
he's catching him with that
weird right hook over the top.

2445
01:08:34,101 --> 01:08:35,570
He's caught him like three times at that.

2446
01:08:36,410 --> 01:08:37,243
Look at that.

2447
01:08:37,340 --> 01:08:39,230
Like my boy Kelly's trying
to get ahold of them.

2448
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:41,330
Cows eating some meat.

2449
01:08:41,390 --> 01:08:42,223
Leather man.

2450
01:08:42,260 --> 01:08:44,010
He's getting fucked up this time.

2451
01:08:44,740 --> 01:08:45,330
Give off.

2452
01:08:45,330 --> 01:08:46,520
He's laughing at him.

2453
01:08:46,521 --> 01:08:47,354
Dude.

2454
01:08:47,570 --> 01:08:49,310
That's got to fuck with
your head a little bit.

2455
01:08:50,110 --> 01:08:50,261
Yeah.

2456
01:08:50,261 --> 01:08:51,094
It didn't feel like that dude.

2457
01:08:51,150 --> 01:08:52,910
Red is knocked a lot of
dudes in the bar out.

2458
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:55,550
He's got a weird right hook man.

2459
01:08:57,370 --> 01:08:58,450
You very confident.

2460
01:08:58,610 --> 01:08:58,990
Yup.

2461
01:08:58,990 --> 01:08:59,823
Thank you.

2462
01:09:04,710 --> 01:09:05,550
Oh Dude.

2463
01:09:05,910 --> 01:09:10,910
Hammers Kelly Kelly's like real
tentative with his shooting blue though.

2464
01:09:10,981 --> 01:09:12,180
It was throwing the punches.

2465
01:09:12,181 --> 01:09:13,110
He's halfway getting there.

2466
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:16,800
This guy's just target practice keeping
the same distance to he pops back a half

2467
01:09:16,801 --> 01:09:17,920
a step and stays there.

2468
01:09:17,930 --> 01:09:18,660
It gets hit.

2469
01:09:18,660 --> 01:09:19,320
Bam.

2470
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:19,831
Right there.

2471
01:09:19,831 --> 01:09:20,300
Bam.

2472
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:21,990
[inaudible] on that front leg a lot,

2473
01:09:22,050 --> 01:09:22,291
dude.

2474
01:09:22,291 --> 01:09:26,370
Kelly's getting little Kelly
might be what you call stiff Joe.

2475
01:09:26,371 --> 01:09:27,100
Jesus.

2476
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:28,590
Louisa's is he stiff?

2477
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:31,410
It looks like the game plan
is the standard name though,

2478
01:09:31,411 --> 01:09:31,741
right?

2479
01:09:31,741 --> 01:09:34,650
You see the Melbourne
man who fight last night.

2480
01:09:34,690 --> 01:09:34,850
Dot.

2481
01:09:34,850 --> 01:09:35,620
Oh my gosh.

2482
01:09:35,620 --> 01:09:36,453
Ameco right.

2483
01:09:36,470 --> 01:09:37,890
Showed Minko or some shit like that.

2484
01:09:37,891 --> 01:09:38,724
That's spinning.

2485
01:09:39,900 --> 01:09:41,010
Oh yeah.

2486
01:09:41,070 --> 01:09:41,481
Oh my God.

2487
01:09:41,481 --> 01:09:42,131
My forearm,

2488
01:09:42,131 --> 01:09:42,964
those nasty,

2489
01:09:43,180 --> 01:09:46,200
nobody has been knocked out more than
the last two years then Melvin Manhoef.

2490
01:09:46,201 --> 01:09:47,034
It's insane.

2491
01:09:47,180 --> 01:09:49,470
I sue Lonnie just got
knocked out by Joe Shields.

2492
01:09:49,471 --> 01:09:53,610
You Joe Schilling put him a
[inaudible] just a couple months ago.

2493
01:09:55,220 --> 01:09:55,951
Those two guys,

2494
01:09:55,951 --> 01:09:57,360
they brought a beautiful fight though,

2495
01:09:57,361 --> 01:09:57,631
man.

2496
01:09:57,631 --> 01:09:58,650
That them coming.

2497
01:09:58,720 --> 01:09:59,040
Yeah.

2498
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:01,460
It was one at one of them was
going to go in that round like,

2499
01:10:03,310 --> 01:10:03,491
yeah,

2500
01:10:03,491 --> 01:10:07,420
he came back too soon and then guys
aren't doing any kind of health care for

2501
01:10:07,421 --> 01:10:08,680
their brains to come back and,

2502
01:10:08,681 --> 01:10:10,090
and increase their,

2503
01:10:10,091 --> 01:10:10,780
uh,

2504
01:10:10,780 --> 01:10:13,720
the recovery time or their speed
or their timing or anything.

2505
01:10:14,470 --> 01:10:14,741
Ben,

2506
01:10:14,741 --> 01:10:16,690
didn't you fight look at this?

2507
01:10:16,750 --> 01:10:16,961
Yeah.

2508
01:10:16,961 --> 01:10:17,990
You fought for Bella tour,

2509
01:10:17,991 --> 01:10:18,200
right?

2510
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:18,730
Yeah,

2511
01:10:18,730 --> 01:10:19,451
I was with them,

2512
01:10:19,451 --> 01:10:20,284
uh,

2513
01:10:20,470 --> 01:10:21,490
for almost three years.

2514
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:23,650
Do you see that Kelly Caught Walsh?

2515
01:10:23,830 --> 01:10:26,890
What's the biggest difference between
them in the UFC as far as like production

2516
01:10:26,891 --> 01:10:27,724
wise?

2517
01:10:27,850 --> 01:10:29,980
Is it a big difference
or no production put up?

2518
01:10:29,981 --> 01:10:31,520
I'm not saying get on the mic.

2519
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:32,411
You know what I'm saying?

2520
01:10:32,411 --> 01:10:32,660
Like,

2521
01:10:32,660 --> 01:10:33,220
uh,

2522
01:10:33,220 --> 01:10:34,960
like you fly in UFC,

2523
01:10:35,020 --> 01:10:36,430
it's like fucking clockwork.

2524
01:10:36,431 --> 01:10:40,240
Bert Bert has it down to a site you
flying in on Tuesday signing posters.

2525
01:10:40,330 --> 01:10:41,890
You've got interviews Wednesday,

2526
01:10:41,890 --> 01:10:41,891
Thursday,

2527
01:10:41,891 --> 01:10:43,150
Wayne's Friday show,

2528
01:10:43,151 --> 01:10:45,070
Saturday tours like that.

2529
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:47,200
I think they were a little rocky.

2530
01:10:47,201 --> 01:10:47,710
Um,

2531
01:10:47,710 --> 01:10:48,140
really,

2532
01:10:48,140 --> 01:10:48,280
ah,

2533
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:49,480
on some of that,

2534
01:10:49,510 --> 01:10:49,870
uh,

2535
01:10:49,870 --> 01:10:52,780
because the tournament's were happening
so fast that I don't even think,

2536
01:10:53,080 --> 01:10:53,470
you know,

2537
01:10:53,470 --> 01:10:57,190
they had planned out what they were
going to do as far as where's the venue,

2538
01:10:57,430 --> 01:10:58,740
where's the next local wow.

2539
01:10:58,930 --> 01:10:59,411
Where's the net?

2540
01:10:59,411 --> 01:10:59,680
Like,

2541
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:00,200
you know,

2542
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:02,770
that that's obviously a process and uh,

2543
01:11:03,490 --> 01:11:05,950
I think sometimes it
was like just making it,

2544
01:11:05,951 --> 01:11:06,300
you know,

2545
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:06,520
yeah.

2546
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:07,570
Just making it happen.

2547
01:11:08,620 --> 01:11:09,880
But they've stepped their game up,

2548
01:11:10,220 --> 01:11:11,053
you know,

2549
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:12,630
killing cats,

2550
01:11:12,631 --> 01:11:13,170
man.

2551
01:11:13,170 --> 01:11:14,040
I was always watching when

2552
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:14,970
you fuck no,

2553
01:11:14,971 --> 01:11:15,411
thank you.

2554
01:11:15,411 --> 01:11:15,750
Yeah,

2555
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:16,583
thank you.

2556
01:11:21,470 --> 01:11:24,920
It's going to be interesting to see what
happens at Beltone with all that via

2557
01:11:24,921 --> 01:11:26,090
car money.

2558
01:11:26,550 --> 01:11:28,010
Cokers no joke either man.

2559
01:11:28,050 --> 01:11:28,411
He also,

2560
01:11:28,411 --> 01:11:29,244
he does something right.

2561
01:11:29,390 --> 01:11:29,880
You know,

2562
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:30,531
and he's,

2563
01:11:30,531 --> 01:11:32,750
he's way better than
anybody else out there.

2564
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:34,560
I saw it was fate or at assigning.

2565
01:11:34,580 --> 01:11:35,030
Yeah.

2566
01:11:35,030 --> 01:11:35,863
Shit.

2567
01:11:36,370 --> 01:11:38,340
Is he the Dana White of Bella [inaudible]?

2568
01:11:38,370 --> 01:11:39,020
Yeah,

2569
01:11:39,020 --> 01:11:40,010
he's the same position.

2570
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:40,550
Yeah.

2571
01:11:40,550 --> 01:11:44,660
He used to work for the UFC and they had
a no compete and then when he left the

2572
01:11:44,661 --> 01:11:45,290
UFC,

2573
01:11:45,290 --> 01:11:45,710
the,

2574
01:11:45,710 --> 01:11:47,300
he's free to do whatever
the fuck you want.

2575
01:11:47,301 --> 01:11:48,520
So then he signed the belt door.

2576
01:11:49,340 --> 01:11:49,581
Yeah.

2577
01:11:49,581 --> 01:11:50,300
Well it's,

2578
01:11:50,300 --> 01:11:52,580
it's good for everybody
because the UFC likes him.

2579
01:11:52,610 --> 01:11:53,540
He's a good dude.

2580
01:11:54,020 --> 01:11:54,741
Fighters like,

2581
01:11:54,741 --> 01:11:55,574
um,

2582
01:11:55,580 --> 01:11:56,030
you know,

2583
01:11:56,030 --> 01:11:59,720
it'll be way more comfortable environment
over there and maybe they'll get some

2584
01:11:59,721 --> 01:12:01,160
good fights and I like,

2585
01:12:01,190 --> 01:12:02,030
I think it's good.

2586
01:12:02,150 --> 01:12:04,880
I think competition is very
important for the athletes.

2587
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:07,700
I think it's the most important thing
when it comes to bargaining power.

2588
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:11,060
So all it's going to do is force
everybody to step their game up.

2589
01:12:11,300 --> 01:12:14,690
And ultimately I believe it
will make MMA more popular.

2590
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:16,070
And that's the key.

2591
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:18,080
The key is Megan and more popular,

2592
01:12:18,081 --> 01:12:22,670
making it to the point where everybody
makes a lot of money and it's really

2593
01:12:22,671 --> 01:12:23,410
close to,

2594
01:12:23,410 --> 01:12:24,260
to becoming that.

2595
01:12:24,770 --> 01:12:27,980
And the way it's going to become that
is if there's a bunch of fucking players

2596
01:12:28,190 --> 01:12:29,001
and everybody's like,

2597
01:12:29,001 --> 01:12:29,211
you know,

2598
01:12:29,211 --> 01:12:30,570
I'll give you x for a well,

2599
01:12:30,580 --> 01:12:32,780
I'll give you y and z.

2600
01:12:32,890 --> 01:12:33,410
Come here.

2601
01:12:33,410 --> 01:12:34,700
We got z sign right here.

2602
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:35,151
Damn,

2603
01:12:35,151 --> 01:12:35,984
you're lucky bitch.

2604
01:12:36,110 --> 01:12:36,531
And I like,

2605
01:12:36,531 --> 01:12:36,681
it's,

2606
01:12:36,681 --> 01:12:37,790
that's how it's got to be.

2607
01:12:37,791 --> 01:12:40,820
That's the only way the money
gets tossed around adequately.

2608
01:12:41,180 --> 01:12:41,511
You know?

2609
01:12:41,511 --> 01:12:43,280
It's like we need competition.

2610
01:12:43,281 --> 01:12:45,110
It's the only way the
talent pool gets bigger too,

2611
01:12:45,111 --> 01:12:45,330
isn't it?

2612
01:12:45,330 --> 01:12:45,411
Yep.

2613
01:12:45,411 --> 01:12:46,850
You have a lot of different varieties.

2614
01:12:46,851 --> 01:12:47,780
Guys can come up here,

2615
01:12:47,781 --> 01:12:48,614
they can come up there.

2616
01:12:48,770 --> 01:12:51,410
Or if you only have this one place where
a guy's got to come up on the tough

2617
01:12:51,411 --> 01:12:52,244
show and then he's got,

2618
01:12:52,250 --> 01:12:55,670
or whatever your favorite
covering the NFL with one team,

2619
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:58,190
Ross takes with each other.

2620
01:12:58,250 --> 01:12:58,660
Yeah.

2621
01:12:58,660 --> 01:12:58,910
Bar.

2622
01:12:58,910 --> 01:12:59,451
They're like saying,

2623
01:12:59,451 --> 01:13:01,790
come to our team and
we'll give you this much,

2624
01:13:01,910 --> 01:13:02,750
this much money.

2625
01:13:02,751 --> 01:13:03,584
So Yup.

2626
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:05,450
In all ways of evolution,

2627
01:13:05,451 --> 01:13:06,440
it's gotta be like that.

2628
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:07,753
Yeah.

2629
01:13:07,850 --> 01:13:08,241
It is.

2630
01:13:08,241 --> 01:13:09,410
It's just how it is,

2631
01:13:09,411 --> 01:13:09,651
man.

2632
01:13:09,651 --> 01:13:11,480
It's just how it is with with everything,

2633
01:13:11,481 --> 01:13:11,661
man.

2634
01:13:11,661 --> 01:13:12,560
You need competition.

2635
01:13:12,561 --> 01:13:13,161
It's good.

2636
01:13:13,161 --> 01:13:14,150
It makes everybody better.

2637
01:13:14,151 --> 01:13:14,571
That's the thing.

2638
01:13:14,571 --> 01:13:15,530
The problem with compensation,

2639
01:13:15,540 --> 01:13:16,760
people get scared of the competition.

2640
01:13:16,761 --> 01:13:17,511
What the competition is,

2641
01:13:17,511 --> 01:13:19,520
the best God damn thing
that could happen to him.

2642
01:13:19,530 --> 01:13:19,970
It really,

2643
01:13:19,970 --> 01:13:20,511
I mean it's the,

2644
01:13:20,511 --> 01:13:21,890
it's the fundamental thing.

2645
01:13:21,890 --> 01:13:23,030
It doesn't mean anybody's mad at you.

2646
01:13:23,031 --> 01:13:23,781
It doesn't mean any of that.

2647
01:13:23,781 --> 01:13:25,370
It means everybody's going
to get better together.

2648
01:13:25,371 --> 01:13:27,260
Like you felt that you don't have any,

2649
01:13:27,290 --> 01:13:27,861
not only that,

2650
01:13:27,861 --> 01:13:30,410
you don't cancel each
other out and didn't get,

2651
01:13:30,430 --> 01:13:33,050
get into this because you're a fan
of fighting in the first place.

2652
01:13:33,230 --> 01:13:35,360
What is someone making
money somehow or another,

2653
01:13:35,361 --> 01:13:36,200
you're not making money.

2654
01:13:36,201 --> 01:13:37,280
Is that really what's going on?

2655
01:13:37,340 --> 01:13:38,210
Cause I don't think it is.

2656
01:13:38,270 --> 01:13:41,270
You're talking about someone's making
money and you're making money from a

2657
01:13:41,271 --> 01:13:43,130
fighter standpoint and
competition's great.

2658
01:13:43,470 --> 01:13:43,790
Dana.

2659
01:13:43,790 --> 01:13:44,121
Why?

2660
01:13:44,121 --> 01:13:46,880
I don't think it makes
everybody more money.

2661
01:13:46,881 --> 01:13:47,900
I really believe so.

2662
01:13:48,020 --> 01:13:49,100
I believe everybody,

2663
01:13:49,340 --> 01:13:52,040
it gets more money if the
sport gets more popular.

2664
01:13:52,220 --> 01:13:54,080
I think if you've got
two giant promotions,

2665
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:54,951
have you got one?

2666
01:13:54,951 --> 01:13:59,030
Say Floyd Mayweather promotion at one
Manny Pacquiao promotion and everybody on

2667
01:13:59,031 --> 01:13:59,691
one side what the,

2668
01:13:59,691 --> 01:14:04,691
you bring them together and you make
fucking 1.5 million pay per view buys like

2669
01:14:04,911 --> 01:14:06,200
those guys will probably do.

2670
01:14:06,350 --> 01:14:08,690
I mean that's how everybody
gets money given up.

2671
01:14:08,990 --> 01:14:09,890
But think about that.

2672
01:14:09,891 --> 01:14:11,940
That's like each one is 50

2673
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:12,490
right?

2674
01:14:12,490 --> 01:14:14,350
How often do pay per views in the UFC hit?

2675
01:14:14,351 --> 01:14:16,450
Seven 50 they don't that often.

2676
01:14:16,570 --> 01:14:17,820
If it's not George Saint Pierre,

2677
01:14:17,830 --> 01:14:19,090
if it's not Brock Lesnar,

2678
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:20,860
you know it's hard to
get those big numbers,

2679
01:14:20,861 --> 01:14:21,041
you know,

2680
01:14:21,041 --> 01:14:22,270
because times are hard.

2681
01:14:22,271 --> 01:14:26,220
People don't want to pony up that kind
of money on a regular basis who are

2682
01:14:26,340 --> 01:14:27,700
watching this fight for free.

2683
01:14:28,150 --> 01:14:28,610
But he loves,

2684
01:14:28,610 --> 01:14:30,370
see Alex torn UFC.

2685
01:14:30,371 --> 01:14:31,204
That's it.

2686
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:32,490
Everything else is like their,

2687
01:14:32,580 --> 01:14:37,580
their feet are organizations which
UFC top three he left sees ever.

2688
01:14:37,901 --> 01:14:38,734
Brock Lesnar,

2689
01:14:41,230 --> 01:14:43,370
Brock Lesnar number that
brought us was number one.

2690
01:14:43,380 --> 01:14:44,440
Never had a Brock Lesnar.

2691
01:14:44,650 --> 01:14:46,210
He fucked US healed again.

2692
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:47,073
Really?

2693
01:14:47,450 --> 01:14:48,283
Ww,

2694
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:49,151
it's silver.

2695
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:53,350
GSP can top GSP what show is it?

2696
01:14:54,010 --> 01:14:55,760
[inaudible]

2697
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:56,560
hungry.

2698
01:14:56,560 --> 01:15:00,190
How about when he fought Randy coture
for the title that had to be frank mayor.

2699
01:15:00,220 --> 01:15:01,700
The second is gonna be the biggest one.

2700
01:15:01,750 --> 01:15:02,690
I 100

2701
01:15:04,910 --> 01:15:05,743
yeah,

2702
01:15:07,610 --> 01:15:08,050
rocks.

2703
01:15:08,050 --> 01:15:08,730
The biggest star.

2704
01:15:08,730 --> 01:15:10,000
Was he coming back?

2705
01:15:10,510 --> 01:15:12,280
Is he what's going is
all switched to talk,

2706
01:15:12,281 --> 01:15:13,114
but I don't know.

2707
01:15:13,130 --> 01:15:13,420
You know,

2708
01:15:13,420 --> 01:15:14,470
there's all sorts of talk,

2709
01:15:14,471 --> 01:15:14,741
but I,

2710
01:15:14,741 --> 01:15:14,951
you know,

2711
01:15:14,951 --> 01:15:15,950
I had heard a lot of talk,

2712
01:15:16,540 --> 01:15:19,870
Bronto papers because we
can't talk over each other.

2713
01:15:19,950 --> 01:15:22,760
People will listen and there's no
way this is going to work with,

2714
01:15:22,790 --> 01:15:24,050
we were listening on headphones this,

2715
01:15:24,051 --> 01:15:24,701
it'd be way better,

2716
01:15:24,701 --> 01:15:26,020
but I want to avoid their headphones.

2717
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:27,520
We just gotta be careful of that shit.

2718
01:15:27,580 --> 01:15:28,720
I think you guys are all doing great.

2719
01:15:29,740 --> 01:15:31,270
What were you saying
about Gina Carano though?

2720
01:15:31,810 --> 01:15:32,230
Oh,

2721
01:15:32,230 --> 01:15:33,880
Gina Carano was supposed to come back.

2722
01:15:33,881 --> 01:15:34,840
I mean that was the talk.

2723
01:15:35,020 --> 01:15:35,710
I kept hearing it.

2724
01:15:35,710 --> 01:15:37,150
I heard it from like agents.

2725
01:15:37,420 --> 01:15:38,890
I heard like there was negotiations.

2726
01:15:38,891 --> 01:15:40,630
I heard a lot of shit and
then nothing happened.

2727
01:15:40,900 --> 01:15:42,040
So you don't know.

2728
01:15:42,130 --> 01:15:44,470
I don't think the Brock Lesnar
thing has gotten that far,

2729
01:15:44,620 --> 01:15:46,930
but all I'm hearing is roamers
everybody's tight lipped.

2730
01:15:47,140 --> 01:15:48,040
But you know,

2731
01:15:48,100 --> 01:15:50,050
you're hearing people saying
that Brock has been training,

2732
01:15:50,230 --> 01:15:51,070
that he's losing weight,

2733
01:15:51,250 --> 01:15:52,170
he's slimming down.

2734
01:15:52,180 --> 01:15:53,590
I took some heat,

2735
01:15:53,650 --> 01:15:55,360
I took some heat people.

2736
01:15:55,361 --> 01:15:57,220
If I called Brock Lesnar out and I did it,

2737
01:15:57,340 --> 01:15:58,061
not even close.

2738
01:15:58,061 --> 01:15:58,731
What happened to you?

2739
01:15:58,731 --> 01:15:59,564
A text with that?

2740
01:16:00,340 --> 01:16:01,000
Uh,

2741
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,080
this is what happened.

2742
01:16:02,470 --> 01:16:02,951
Sick.

2743
01:16:02,951 --> 01:16:04,720
This is old to six months ago,

2744
01:16:04,721 --> 01:16:06,370
I did an interview with the UFC.

2745
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:07,870
It was 20 questions.

2746
01:16:08,770 --> 01:16:10,180
One was like a,

2747
01:16:10,870 --> 01:16:11,720
what do you prefer?

2748
01:16:11,740 --> 01:16:12,820
Ketchup or mustard?

2749
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:13,960
We're this will kind of bullshit.

2750
01:16:13,990 --> 01:16:15,220
We're talking about 20 questions,

2751
01:16:15,370 --> 01:16:16,330
ketchup or mustard.

2752
01:16:16,510 --> 01:16:16,841
I said,

2753
01:16:16,841 --> 01:16:19,120
anyone who says mustard is part of Isis.

2754
01:16:19,150 --> 01:16:22,360
Like every American's gonna choose
fucking catch up and you're like joking

2755
01:16:22,361 --> 01:16:23,020
around.

2756
01:16:23,020 --> 01:16:24,760
Then question number 15 goes,

2757
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:26,050
uh,

2758
01:16:26,050 --> 01:16:27,250
who drives see come back,

2759
01:16:27,251 --> 01:16:28,540
GSP or Brock Lesnar?

2760
01:16:28,870 --> 01:16:29,320
I said,

2761
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:29,501
Oh,

2762
01:16:29,501 --> 01:16:30,520
well GSPS my boy.

2763
01:16:30,521 --> 01:16:31,900
I'd love if just became back.

2764
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:33,070
But being a heavyweight,

2765
01:16:33,310 --> 01:16:34,780
I'd love if Brock lesbian came back.

2766
01:16:34,781 --> 01:16:36,130
He's the biggest star we've ever had.

2767
01:16:36,310 --> 01:16:36,970
And they'd go,

2768
01:16:36,970 --> 01:16:37,121
oh,

2769
01:16:37,121 --> 01:16:38,170
would you like to find them?

2770
01:16:38,370 --> 01:16:39,190
And I went,

2771
01:16:39,190 --> 01:16:39,341
well,

2772
01:16:39,341 --> 01:16:39,491
yeah,

2773
01:16:39,491 --> 01:16:40,660
he's the biggest star ever.

2774
01:16:40,661 --> 01:16:42,250
That'd be great if he came back.

2775
01:16:42,310 --> 01:16:42,541
Yeah,

2776
01:16:42,541 --> 01:16:43,374
I'd fight them.

2777
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:44,433
That's it.

2778
01:16:44,470 --> 01:16:45,370
Six months later.

2779
01:16:45,371 --> 01:16:48,670
What about you saying about sending
them go back to playing grab ass?

2780
01:16:48,671 --> 01:16:50,050
It's just me like making a joke.

2781
01:16:50,650 --> 01:16:50,891
I go,

2782
01:16:50,891 --> 01:16:51,101
yeah,

2783
01:16:51,101 --> 01:16:54,670
if he wants to come to the UFC and he's
tired of playing grab ass in the WWE

2784
01:16:54,910 --> 01:16:56,950
getting paid to fake fight and
what's come back and you see,

2785
01:16:56,951 --> 01:16:57,830
I'd love to fight him.

2786
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:01,480
Hear it too instead of like
seeing it written for sure.

2787
01:17:01,481 --> 01:17:02,314
It looks horrible.

2788
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:02,741
Bullshit.

2789
01:17:02,741 --> 01:17:03,580
When they write it out,

2790
01:17:03,990 --> 01:17:04,460
I'm like,

2791
01:17:04,460 --> 01:17:04,790
that's the,

2792
01:17:04,790 --> 01:17:05,081
I'm like,

2793
01:17:05,081 --> 01:17:05,831
that's my friend.

2794
01:17:05,831 --> 01:17:06,790
That's not what they meant,

2795
01:17:06,791 --> 01:17:07,624
man.

2796
01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:08,890
That was six months ago.

2797
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:10,250
You'll see the night like

2798
01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:10,761
whatever,

2799
01:17:10,761 --> 01:17:13,850
four or five weeks ago goes Brendan
Schaub calls out Brock Lesnar.

2800
01:17:14,030 --> 01:17:14,421
First of all,

2801
01:17:14,421 --> 01:17:15,380
he's retired.

2802
01:17:15,381 --> 01:17:16,370
I never called him out.

2803
01:17:16,490 --> 01:17:17,720
They just need the content.

2804
01:17:17,930 --> 01:17:21,230
So then the Brock Lesnar
train is crazy man.

2805
01:17:21,231 --> 01:17:25,250
His fans came after me like
fucking crazy hurt my feelings.

2806
01:17:25,460 --> 01:17:26,570
I put a statement out,

2807
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:26,871
I was like,

2808
01:17:26,871 --> 01:17:27,704
Yo man,

2809
01:17:27,770 --> 01:17:29,190
come on feelings.

2810
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:30,290
Fuck Sakes.

2811
01:17:30,350 --> 01:17:32,360
How many misspelled tweets did you get?

2812
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:33,333
Oh

2813
01:17:35,870 --> 01:17:36,381
Dude,

2814
01:17:36,381 --> 01:17:38,690
I never seen hate like
when I was shitting.

2815
01:17:38,691 --> 01:17:42,920
Not like Tony Hinchcliffe is a crazy pro
wrestling fan and so when he was on the

2816
01:17:42,921 --> 01:17:45,110
podcast mostly just to rile him up,

2817
01:17:45,111 --> 01:17:47,090
I was just shitting on pro wrestling,

2818
01:17:47,330 --> 01:17:48,950
just dump it on her and um,

2819
01:17:49,370 --> 01:17:52,580
go tsunami of poorly written tweets.

2820
01:17:52,581 --> 01:17:54,020
That came my way was like,

2821
01:17:54,021 --> 01:17:54,854
what is this?

2822
01:17:55,310 --> 01:17:59,360
I had to like get my head above water
and try to figure out what all these kids

2823
01:17:59,361 --> 01:18:01,010
either extra words are

2824
01:18:03,110 --> 01:18:06,260
letters that are in the wrong
place and ra would do with hate.

2825
01:18:06,260 --> 01:18:10,280
Mail is one I just was looking in one
night and he's just going through it

2826
01:18:10,281 --> 01:18:10,610
every,

2827
01:18:10,610 --> 01:18:11,990
every time the guy would
send him something,

2828
01:18:12,220 --> 01:18:15,580
he would just send them the
corrections of the previous thing.

2829
01:18:15,610 --> 01:18:17,210
Like you're getting way better.

2830
01:18:17,570 --> 01:18:18,560
Nice punctuation.

2831
01:18:18,561 --> 01:18:22,100
Like and it was just this whole
fucking list of corrections of his,

2832
01:18:22,310 --> 01:18:23,720
like it's scripted email.

2833
01:18:24,160 --> 01:18:24,410
No,

2834
01:18:24,410 --> 01:18:24,890
no,

2835
01:18:24,890 --> 01:18:27,790
like the dude just saying you
suck spelled with two main ones.

2836
01:18:28,510 --> 01:18:29,343
Facebook.

2837
01:18:30,300 --> 01:18:32,900
I had grown men coming at me.

2838
01:18:32,930 --> 01:18:33,220
I'm like,

2839
01:18:33,220 --> 01:18:33,780
Bro,

2840
01:18:33,780 --> 01:18:36,030
you're 50 defending the WWE.

2841
01:18:36,250 --> 01:18:39,420
You Look Brock Lesnar's
America shit on Brock.

2842
01:18:39,450 --> 01:18:42,740
Measure you shitting on a man champion.

2843
01:18:43,900 --> 01:18:45,360
When he would fight all the wrestlers,

2844
01:18:45,410 --> 01:18:46,280
they would all come out,

2845
01:18:46,310 --> 01:18:47,360
they would all come out and watch them.

2846
01:18:47,361 --> 01:18:48,400
There's a whole front line of,

2847
01:18:48,420 --> 01:18:48,890
they're like,

2848
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:49,341
yeah,

2849
01:18:49,341 --> 01:18:51,830
like stone cold and Goldberg
and all those guys right there.

2850
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:52,040
Oh,

2851
01:18:52,040 --> 01:18:53,090
Brock's a monster man.

2852
01:18:53,090 --> 01:18:53,521
He's a beast.

2853
01:18:53,521 --> 01:18:54,560
He's great for this board.

2854
01:18:54,561 --> 01:18:54,981
Be Great.

2855
01:18:54,981 --> 01:18:57,680
If it came back well I
really still to this day,

2856
01:18:57,800 --> 01:18:59,960
oh nice left hand by Kelly.

2857
01:19:00,110 --> 01:19:01,430
I still to this day think that it,

2858
01:19:01,431 --> 01:19:03,350
Brock Lesnar did it the right way,

2859
01:19:03,620 --> 01:19:06,410
like a Brock Lesnar went and instead of,

2860
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:06,711
you know,

2861
01:19:06,711 --> 01:19:11,711
doing WWE for all those years
and not striking and you know,

2862
01:19:12,231 --> 01:19:15,140
and then going into the UFC and
immediately fighting the best guys,

2863
01:19:15,141 --> 01:19:16,700
the world after one professional fight.

2864
01:19:17,030 --> 01:19:21,080
If they took Brock Lesnar and brought
him to like an American top team,

2865
01:19:21,230 --> 01:19:22,940
like one of those professional camps,

2866
01:19:23,090 --> 01:19:25,820
whether or black Zillions or you know,

2867
01:19:25,821 --> 01:19:26,541
Aka,

2868
01:19:26,541 --> 01:19:27,350
something like that,

2869
01:19:27,350 --> 01:19:30,050
when they're going to take you and they're
going to take you through every step

2870
01:19:30,051 --> 01:19:30,470
of the way.

2871
01:19:30,470 --> 01:19:32,030
Like Matt Hume would have been the guy.

2872
01:19:32,180 --> 01:19:36,320
I get a guy like Eric Paulson essentially
did what he could when he had them,

2873
01:19:36,530 --> 01:19:38,290
but I think a guy like Brock Lesnar's,

2874
01:19:38,291 --> 01:19:39,620
she'd been brought along slowly.

2875
01:19:39,620 --> 01:19:40,370
You should like,

2876
01:19:40,370 --> 01:19:43,610
he's got the potential to
be the heavyweight ever.

2877
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:44,091
I mean,

2878
01:19:44,091 --> 01:19:44,691
I know he did.

2879
01:19:44,691 --> 01:19:45,381
He did a lot of that,

2880
01:19:45,381 --> 01:19:47,000
but I'm saying do it over years.

2881
01:19:47,030 --> 01:19:48,110
The other thing is is you know,

2882
01:19:48,230 --> 01:19:53,210
difficult it is to get training for
a guy of that skill set in that size.

2883
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:53,540
Yeah,

2884
01:19:53,540 --> 01:19:54,051
that's real.

2885
01:19:54,051 --> 01:19:54,531
You know what I mean?

2886
01:19:54,531 --> 01:19:57,770
It's like you almost need to condition
them and get them tired before you would

2887
01:19:57,771 --> 01:19:58,940
train with a guy like that.

2888
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:00,051
First of all,

2889
01:20:00,051 --> 01:20:00,884
huge and it's big,

2890
01:20:01,100 --> 01:20:02,510
but his issue is striking.

2891
01:20:02,820 --> 01:20:04,370
There's a lot of big guys in Holland.

2892
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:06,890
You go down the hall and and
spar with Daniel Geeta all day,

2893
01:20:06,891 --> 01:20:09,420
you know you're going to learn
today that you can just do like,

2894
01:20:09,510 --> 01:20:09,790
yeah.

2895
01:20:09,790 --> 01:20:14,100
I'm a real believer in like if you
already spiral a lot and then great,

2896
01:20:14,101 --> 01:20:14,371
you know,

2897
01:20:14,371 --> 01:20:15,204
you're tough already.

2898
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:17,670
There's no need to do that twice a week.

2899
01:20:17,900 --> 01:20:18,300
Right.

2900
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:19,140
Go ahead and hit mits,

2901
01:20:19,141 --> 01:20:20,070
get a good trainer,

2902
01:20:20,130 --> 01:20:21,210
hit Mitts all the time.

2903
01:20:21,211 --> 01:20:21,981
Your fucking timing,

2904
01:20:21,981 --> 01:20:23,490
you be there and all that stuff.

2905
01:20:23,491 --> 01:20:24,390
Put that shit together.

2906
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:25,740
We already know you're
not afraid to get hit.

2907
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:26,550
Awesome.

2908
01:20:26,550 --> 01:20:28,320
You know that's the best
way to do it I think.

2909
01:20:28,590 --> 01:20:28,771
Well,

2910
01:20:28,771 --> 01:20:32,430
I think that the guys who are going to
take you like Duane Ludwig style through

2911
01:20:32,431 --> 01:20:36,870
drills that stimulate each individual
position that you're going to be in.

2912
01:20:36,871 --> 01:20:38,460
This is your response to that position.

2913
01:20:38,610 --> 01:20:39,750
This is how you get back.

2914
01:20:39,751 --> 01:20:40,140
You know,

2915
01:20:40,140 --> 01:20:41,310
this is your setup again.

2916
01:20:41,460 --> 01:20:41,701
You know,

2917
01:20:41,701 --> 01:20:42,420
you're like,

2918
01:20:42,420 --> 01:20:43,170
rob came in,

2919
01:20:43,170 --> 01:20:46,320
was really good about that brown bear
when he first started training with rob

2920
01:20:46,321 --> 01:20:51,321
came in like you saw like rob in system
and Brandon when he was fighting him.

2921
01:20:51,750 --> 01:20:53,670
Dwayne I think a six gun,

2922
01:20:53,671 --> 01:20:56,040
Gibson [inaudible] and Mike Winkeljohn,

2923
01:20:56,910 --> 01:20:57,661
Brandon Gibson,

2924
01:20:57,661 --> 01:20:57,871
man.

2925
01:20:57,871 --> 01:20:58,621
He's phenomenally.

2926
01:20:58,621 --> 01:21:01,410
See the video he did with
the elbows with cow recently.

2927
01:21:02,540 --> 01:21:06,420
I mean he's so innovative and he's
so thoughtful about it and all.

2928
01:21:06,421 --> 01:21:07,171
He's all,

2929
01:21:07,171 --> 01:21:10,380
he's got his love and care for those guys
and then he puts that into him and he

2930
01:21:10,381 --> 01:21:12,350
puts the routines together.

2931
01:21:12,810 --> 01:21:13,231
Man,

2932
01:21:13,231 --> 01:21:14,730
they're fucking fantastic.

2933
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:15,001
Yeah,

2934
01:21:15,001 --> 01:21:16,470
there's a lot of good trainers out there,

2935
01:21:16,471 --> 01:21:17,010
man.

2936
01:21:17,010 --> 01:21:18,810
You know there's a lot of
guys out there that are,

2937
01:21:18,811 --> 01:21:19,201
you know,

2938
01:21:19,201 --> 01:21:22,980
shown guys a real high level stuff
and you see seeing like striking

2939
01:21:22,981 --> 01:21:23,611
combinations.

2940
01:21:23,611 --> 01:21:27,560
Especially like if you look at like Tj
Dillashaw versus Hanan Barao like when

2941
01:21:27,561 --> 01:21:31,440
one was a fucking last time we ever
saw a guy go from being TJ Dosha on the

2942
01:21:31,441 --> 01:21:33,720
ultimate fighter to what two and a half,

2943
01:21:33,721 --> 01:21:38,721
three years later being this super fluid
bad mother fucker kickboxer we can mean

2944
01:21:38,731 --> 01:21:42,120
you look at a moving around
shuffle and switching stances,

2945
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:46,320
like popping them with straight laughs
from the fucking southpaw stance and then

2946
01:21:46,321 --> 01:21:48,120
hitting them with an inside
leg kick and you're like,

2947
01:21:48,121 --> 01:21:48,840
whoa,

2948
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:53,840
this is literally not the same dude then
he was three years ago and you're going

2949
01:21:54,131 --> 01:21:55,200
to see more and more of that.

2950
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:57,660
How much boy Duke Roufus cm punk dude,

2951
01:21:57,930 --> 01:21:58,411
first of all,

2952
01:21:58,411 --> 01:22:00,690
Duke Roufus did a great
job with Tyron Woodley.

2953
01:22:00,900 --> 01:22:02,340
Woodley settled down.

2954
01:22:02,460 --> 01:22:07,260
He didn't dim empty his gas tank
in his last fight with Kelvin,

2955
01:22:07,830 --> 01:22:08,780
with Calvin gasoline.

2956
01:22:09,030 --> 01:22:09,863
That one,

2957
01:22:10,010 --> 01:22:10,800
it was a good fight.

2958
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:10,981
I mean,

2959
01:22:10,981 --> 01:22:12,300
it wasn't the worst fight in the world.

2960
01:22:12,650 --> 01:22:13,321
It was a good fight.

2961
01:22:13,321 --> 01:22:13,581
He wouldn't,

2962
01:22:13,581 --> 01:22:15,870
they broke his foot in the first
round and show that that's true.

2963
01:22:15,871 --> 01:22:15,991
Yeah.

2964
01:22:15,991 --> 01:22:17,550
He broke just fucking
foot in the first round.

2965
01:22:17,551 --> 01:22:18,384
You never knew it.

2966
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:18,840
He just,

2967
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:20,460
he just moved around like nothing.

2968
01:22:20,790 --> 01:22:23,390
But what I liked about it is he,

2969
01:22:23,460 --> 01:22:25,020
he showed patients in that fight,

2970
01:22:25,110 --> 01:22:28,860
like you've seen him in fights before
we explodes and he empties the gas tank

2971
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:32,190
and the first round and then he has
a hard time in the second and third.

2972
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:34,500
Like he was way more patient.

2973
01:22:34,501 --> 01:22:36,630
Like you could almost see Duke,

2974
01:22:36,860 --> 01:22:37,110
you know,

2975
01:22:37,110 --> 01:22:38,340
and Duke style,

2976
01:22:38,430 --> 01:22:39,950
like influencing him slightly.

2977
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:41,310
How do you think cm punk is going to do?

2978
01:22:42,150 --> 01:22:42,721
I don't think,

2979
01:22:42,721 --> 01:22:43,200
uh,

2980
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:44,130
we have any idea.

2981
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:45,540
I don't think we have any idea.

2982
01:22:45,650 --> 01:22:45,820
I,

2983
01:22:45,820 --> 01:22:49,470
if I watched the guy do anything
other than throw some kicks,

2984
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:50,640
which is all I've ever seen.

2985
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:56,000
I saw him throw some kicks and I'm hoping
with every fiber of my being that he

2986
01:22:56,101 --> 01:22:59,730
was just playing around and then he
actually kicks better than that because

2987
01:22:59,810 --> 01:23:00,210
he's,

2988
01:23:00,210 --> 01:23:04,380
there's like some back stage WWE thing
where he's thrown roundhouse kicks on

2989
01:23:04,381 --> 01:23:07,300
like a wrestling and
I don't understand it.

2990
01:23:07,420 --> 01:23:09,370
I mean it's either he was playing around,

2991
01:23:09,670 --> 01:23:10,720
they were a good thing though.

2992
01:23:10,721 --> 01:23:15,400
He just started doing karate like a week
ago or you don't understand it and he's

2993
01:23:15,401 --> 01:23:16,330
going to mystify people.

2994
01:23:16,780 --> 01:23:20,920
Well or he just fucking around
because he's a Sheldon and that's,

2995
01:23:21,010 --> 01:23:21,281
you know,

2996
01:23:21,281 --> 01:23:22,770
when he's doing those things backstage,

2997
01:23:22,780 --> 01:23:25,390
she's not trying to show everybody
he's the ultimate bad ass.

2998
01:23:25,391 --> 01:23:26,070
He's being,

2999
01:23:26,070 --> 01:23:26,903
you know,

3000
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:28,630
is there any word on
who is going to fight?

3001
01:23:29,110 --> 01:23:29,920
No word,

3002
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:32,860
nor is there a word on a timetable
like when he's going to fight,

3003
01:23:33,220 --> 01:23:33,641
you know what?

3004
01:23:33,641 --> 01:23:35,140
They did have an opponent for him.

3005
01:23:35,141 --> 01:23:37,390
The Guy who fought dot Mickey work last

3006
01:23:38,950 --> 01:23:39,880
[inaudible]

3007
01:23:41,470 --> 01:23:42,303
face.

3008
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:46,110
[inaudible] I've know him so well.

3009
01:23:46,260 --> 01:23:48,390
I could see the laugh being suppressed.

3010
01:23:49,270 --> 01:23:50,530
Joe Cm

3011
01:23:50,530 --> 01:23:51,363
punk.

3012
01:23:51,510 --> 01:23:52,343
No.

3013
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:53,220
Um,

3014
01:23:53,221 --> 01:23:54,054
I mean,

3015
01:23:54,690 --> 01:23:55,523
this is what I think.

3016
01:23:55,540 --> 01:23:56,860
I don't think it's good for the sport.

3017
01:23:56,890 --> 01:24:01,570
Just if he goes in there and you know
he fights and people watch it cause he's

3018
01:24:01,571 --> 01:24:02,290
famous.

3019
01:24:02,290 --> 01:24:03,580
I think people will pay attention,

3020
01:24:03,670 --> 01:24:07,090
but it's not necessarily good for the
sport if they're just paying attention

3021
01:24:07,091 --> 01:24:08,050
because you see him pump.

3022
01:24:08,620 --> 01:24:09,453
However,

3023
01:24:09,490 --> 01:24:14,490
I think it is good for the sport if
he truly has a real desire to become a

3024
01:24:15,371 --> 01:24:17,110
professional mixed martial arts fighter.

3025
01:24:17,111 --> 01:24:18,790
This isn't just a money making scam.

3026
01:24:18,940 --> 01:24:20,500
This isn't just to publicity scam.

3027
01:24:20,620 --> 01:24:22,150
This isn't just a one time thing.

3028
01:24:22,210 --> 01:24:26,320
This is a guy who at x
age 36 or whatever it is,

3029
01:24:26,321 --> 01:24:26,891
is decided.

3030
01:24:26,891 --> 01:24:27,400
You know what,

3031
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:28,233
I,

3032
01:24:28,270 --> 01:24:30,610
I want a new chapter of my
life and that new chapters.

3033
01:24:30,611 --> 01:24:34,300
I want to try my hand 100%
committed to professional fighting.

3034
01:24:34,330 --> 01:24:35,230
I think that's what he's doing.

3035
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:36,820
I got advantage then it's good,

3036
01:24:36,870 --> 01:24:37,580
but

3037
01:24:37,580 --> 01:24:38,920
only know if he's gotten talent.

3038
01:24:39,870 --> 01:24:40,680
If it works.

3039
01:24:40,680 --> 01:24:41,270
Skill set.

3040
01:24:41,270 --> 01:24:41,430
Yeah.

3041
01:24:41,430 --> 01:24:42,241
We don't know.

3042
01:24:42,241 --> 01:24:42,751
We don't,

3043
01:24:42,751 --> 01:24:43,960
we literally don't know.

3044
01:24:43,990 --> 01:24:45,300
No wrestling background,

3045
01:24:45,301 --> 01:24:46,440
no striking back.

3046
01:24:47,130 --> 01:24:49,800
Doesn't even know if he
likes to compete and pause.

3047
01:24:50,990 --> 01:24:51,940
He does Jujitsu.

3048
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:53,040
Wrestling.

3049
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:54,780
Fucking pill doesn't come.

3050
01:24:54,781 --> 01:24:54,991
It has.

3051
01:24:54,991 --> 01:24:58,170
He been to the Pan ams does even know
if he likes to go through a key of eight

3052
01:24:58,171 --> 01:24:59,150
guys that he's going to have to go.

3053
01:24:59,210 --> 01:25:00,300
When I say he does Jujitsu,

3054
01:25:00,301 --> 01:25:04,560
he was doing Jiu Jitsu on the road cause
Henner is married to Eve Torres who was

3055
01:25:04,561 --> 01:25:06,810
the WWE diva champion.

3056
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:08,820
So he was on the road
with eve all the time.

3057
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,610
So cm punk and Henner would work,

3058
01:25:11,611 --> 01:25:12,090
you know,

3059
01:25:12,090 --> 01:25:13,080
once a month together

3060
01:25:17,510 --> 01:25:18,450
and just said

3061
01:25:20,010 --> 01:25:20,820
once a month,

3062
01:25:20,820 --> 01:25:21,653
maybe once a month

3063
01:25:23,850 --> 01:25:25,330
on the fucking floor you're on,

3064
01:25:25,780 --> 01:25:28,410
here's what page and check this choke out.

3065
01:25:28,580 --> 01:25:29,413
It's like fuck.

3066
01:25:29,670 --> 01:25:30,360
You know when you,

3067
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:32,150
you show a girl something
that you're dating,

3068
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:35,310
she put her you sure triangle just so
she can get her next boyfriend and a

3069
01:25:35,311 --> 01:25:36,210
triangle too,

3070
01:25:36,270 --> 01:25:37,031
just like piss on her.

3071
01:25:37,031 --> 01:25:37,864
You know what I mean?

3072
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:40,880
They think they think
they know what you did.

3073
01:25:44,420 --> 01:25:48,850
You're one of the triangle
and then you don't know.

3074
01:25:48,870 --> 01:25:50,520
My ex boyfriend taught me Jetta.

3075
01:25:51,150 --> 01:25:51,331
Yeah,

3076
01:25:51,331 --> 01:25:52,860
I'm gonna put you in a fucking triangle

3077
01:25:55,440 --> 01:25:56,680
x go for a long time ago,

3078
01:25:56,681 --> 01:25:57,514
a triangle.

3079
01:25:57,630 --> 01:25:59,910
And she was so obsessed with
that were just lying in bed.

3080
01:25:59,911 --> 01:26:03,670
I'm trying to watch Howard stern on e
and she's trying to put in a triangle.

3081
01:26:03,690 --> 01:26:04,160
I'm like,

3082
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:04,811
fucking God,

3083
01:26:04,811 --> 01:26:05,690
can you stop?

3084
01:26:05,691 --> 01:26:06,480
Can you stop?

3085
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:06,850
And she's like,

3086
01:26:06,850 --> 01:26:07,100
ah.

3087
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:07,800
She's laughing at me.

3088
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:09,680
I'm really trying to
watch this fucking show.

3089
01:26:09,890 --> 01:26:10,250
And he's like,

3090
01:26:10,250 --> 01:26:10,641
ah,

3091
01:26:10,641 --> 01:26:13,780
she's trying to get me to fucking
triangle wound bed and she puts me in a

3092
01:26:13,781 --> 01:26:14,091
triangle.

3093
01:26:14,091 --> 01:26:14,301
I go,

3094
01:26:14,301 --> 01:26:15,410
you're going to start crying.

3095
01:26:15,590 --> 01:26:17,390
You are definitely going to start crying.

3096
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:18,890
She's giggling.

3097
01:26:18,890 --> 01:26:19,491
So I fucking,

3098
01:26:19,491 --> 01:26:19,701
you know,

3099
01:26:19,701 --> 01:26:20,534
I defend like

3100
01:26:24,010 --> 01:26:25,740
she puts me in a triangle facet.

3101
01:26:26,030 --> 01:26:27,770
You are going to start crying.

3102
01:26:29,480 --> 01:26:30,410
So I picked her up.

3103
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:34,100
I stood up just like Arona
rampage and I picked her up.

3104
01:26:34,310 --> 01:26:35,540
I was going to slam her on the bed.

3105
01:26:35,590 --> 01:26:36,470
It wasn't going to hurt her.

3106
01:26:36,590 --> 01:26:37,430
That's the fucking bed.

3107
01:26:37,431 --> 01:26:38,820
Can be good

3108
01:26:41,660 --> 01:26:42,493
on the bed,

3109
01:26:42,890 --> 01:26:43,723
on the bed,

3110
01:26:44,840 --> 01:26:45,820
slammed her on the bed.

3111
01:26:45,821 --> 01:26:46,770
I want to stop this right now.

3112
01:26:46,790 --> 01:26:47,190
She,

3113
01:26:47,190 --> 01:26:48,023
she like,

3114
01:26:48,190 --> 01:26:49,023
she let go.

3115
01:26:49,580 --> 01:26:49,970
She like,

3116
01:26:49,970 --> 01:26:50,803
oh the triangle.

3117
01:26:50,840 --> 01:26:55,820
But she bounced off and landed on
the floor and she like tweet Theresa.

3118
01:26:55,821 --> 01:26:56,654
She starts crying.

3119
01:26:57,950 --> 01:27:00,230
She runs to the bathroom and I'm like,

3120
01:27:00,231 --> 01:27:01,010
oh my God.

3121
01:27:01,010 --> 01:27:01,940
So I like strolling.

3122
01:27:01,941 --> 01:27:02,211
I said,

3123
01:27:02,211 --> 01:27:06,320
I told you you were going to start
crying and she hasn't hot water running.

3124
01:27:09,530 --> 01:27:09,951
I said,

3125
01:27:09,951 --> 01:27:12,200
let's go to the emergency room right now.

3126
01:27:12,201 --> 01:27:13,034
She goes,

3127
01:27:13,550 --> 01:27:14,001
come on you.

3128
01:27:14,001 --> 01:27:15,020
It's probably broken.

3129
01:27:15,021 --> 01:27:15,210
He was,

3130
01:27:15,210 --> 01:27:15,650
no,

3131
01:27:15,650 --> 01:27:16,483
it's not broken.

3132
01:27:16,610 --> 01:27:16,840
It's,

3133
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:17,451
I would sound like,

3134
01:27:17,451 --> 01:27:18,284
okay.

3135
01:27:18,360 --> 01:27:18,530
I,

3136
01:27:18,530 --> 01:27:19,363
I'm just trying to,

3137
01:27:19,620 --> 01:27:22,290
cause I'm wondering Howard
stern traveler strategy.

3138
01:27:22,790 --> 01:27:23,930
Let's go cut it off.

3139
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:25,160
Let's get it removed.

3140
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:26,021
No,

3141
01:27:26,021 --> 01:27:26,171
no,

3142
01:27:26,171 --> 01:27:26,360
no.

3143
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:26,691
It's good.

3144
01:27:26,691 --> 01:27:27,410
It's good.

3145
01:27:27,410 --> 01:27:28,610
She would always exaggerate.

3146
01:27:29,090 --> 01:27:29,420
She was,

3147
01:27:29,420 --> 01:27:32,080
I told them to stop with the
fucking Tririga for a ranch

3148
01:27:34,820 --> 01:27:35,653
behind you.

3149
01:27:39,340 --> 01:27:41,330
Cause I like a domestic violence dispute.

3150
01:27:41,331 --> 01:27:43,880
What if that would you just fucked up?

3151
01:27:44,160 --> 01:27:46,030
I'm saying that's a felony.

3152
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:48,050
That check's going to
come out of the woodwork.

3153
01:27:48,500 --> 01:27:50,810
It was 15 years ago.

3154
01:27:50,811 --> 01:27:51,644
I was appropriate.

3155
01:27:51,730 --> 01:27:52,563
What did I know?

3156
01:27:53,480 --> 01:27:54,780
The timeline.

3157
01:27:56,310 --> 01:27:57,143
Vagina.

3158
01:27:57,160 --> 01:27:59,540
You do not give a timeline out.

3159
01:27:59,720 --> 01:28:01,590
Don't say when you sue sue hoists,

3160
01:28:01,640 --> 01:28:03,450
I think you met 20 years inspiration.

3161
01:28:03,980 --> 01:28:04,551
I never hit her.

3162
01:28:04,551 --> 01:28:06,410
I just use triangle escape.

3163
01:28:07,710 --> 01:28:08,260
Wow.

3164
01:28:08,260 --> 01:28:09,220
That's weird.

3165
01:28:10,300 --> 01:28:11,133
Hm.

3166
01:28:11,380 --> 01:28:12,410
Well we weren't paying attention.

3167
01:28:12,411 --> 01:28:13,540
You didn't win.

3168
01:28:15,450 --> 01:28:16,700
He landed more strikes.

3169
01:28:17,660 --> 01:28:18,230
Did it?

3170
01:28:18,230 --> 01:28:19,020
Yeah.

3171
01:28:19,020 --> 01:28:21,630
One 2189 you know what man?

3172
01:28:23,060 --> 01:28:25,080
How many that make us feel better?

3173
01:28:25,081 --> 01:28:26,040
I would like to see.

3174
01:28:27,350 --> 01:28:27,841
That's true.

3175
01:28:27,841 --> 01:28:28,674
You're right.

3176
01:28:28,940 --> 01:28:30,600
But that's the move of the fight.

3177
01:28:31,230 --> 01:28:33,750
The move of the fight
is a half half a jab.

3178
01:28:33,850 --> 01:28:35,250
They move with the fight.

3179
01:28:35,620 --> 01:28:37,080
The fight is him getting hit.

3180
01:28:37,110 --> 01:28:37,943
What?

3181
01:28:41,290 --> 01:28:41,921
That was amazing.

3182
01:28:41,921 --> 01:28:43,120
That was a tricky punch.

3183
01:28:43,720 --> 01:28:43,991
Well,

3184
01:28:43,991 --> 01:28:45,700
we don't know what happened in that fight,

3185
01:28:45,970 --> 01:28:46,690
honestly.

3186
01:28:46,690 --> 01:28:50,410
We really weren't watching that fight to
watch the key moments in the beginning

3187
01:28:50,411 --> 01:28:51,910
where he was getting hit by right hooks.

3188
01:28:53,170 --> 01:28:53,530
Tate,

3189
01:28:53,530 --> 01:28:54,040
look,

3190
01:28:54,040 --> 01:28:54,873
that's,

3191
01:28:55,290 --> 01:28:57,910
that's part of his success
off of cats and God,

3192
01:28:57,911 --> 01:28:59,980
I'll use that for an argument.

3193
01:29:01,610 --> 01:29:01,820
Yeah,

3194
01:29:01,820 --> 01:29:02,280
she,

3195
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:03,070
you know what?

3196
01:29:03,070 --> 01:29:04,410
That's your stomping grounds.

3197
01:29:07,030 --> 01:29:07,660
Look good.

3198
01:29:07,660 --> 01:29:08,493
He's

3199
01:29:11,160 --> 01:29:11,993
pretty good,

3200
01:29:12,830 --> 01:29:13,280
dude.

3201
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:14,910
It's nice to find more interesting now.

3202
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:15,870
One of her fights,

3203
01:29:15,871 --> 01:29:17,850
there's a clip of her when she wants,

3204
01:29:17,851 --> 01:29:20,200
she screamed and it's,

3205
01:29:20,201 --> 01:29:24,360
it's this fucking crime
or roar that it's like,

3206
01:29:24,361 --> 01:29:25,980
it's one of the craziest screams.

3207
01:29:25,981 --> 01:29:27,660
I remember the gentleman's mouth.

3208
01:29:27,870 --> 01:29:28,703
Can we find that?

3209
01:29:29,790 --> 01:29:30,241
I bet it.

3210
01:29:30,241 --> 01:29:32,310
I bet if you just Google cat Zingano,

3211
01:29:32,311 --> 01:29:33,001
scream,

3212
01:29:33,001 --> 01:29:33,331
watch.

3213
01:29:33,331 --> 01:29:34,110
I'll find it right here.

3214
01:29:34,110 --> 01:29:34,501
And she was like,

3215
01:29:34,501 --> 01:29:35,430
shut the fuck up.

3216
01:29:35,460 --> 01:29:36,660
I don't take orders from you.

3217
01:29:37,720 --> 01:29:38,680
That's a red bag institute.

3218
01:29:38,700 --> 01:29:38,791
What?

3219
01:29:38,791 --> 01:29:39,690
I would say that and he was like,

3220
01:29:39,700 --> 01:29:42,060
it wouldn't do shackle
red man by that video.

3221
01:29:42,620 --> 01:29:43,310
It's sick.

3222
01:29:43,310 --> 01:29:44,143
Wouldn't move.

3223
01:29:44,310 --> 01:29:46,890
He just ignore me cause I
don't who listen to Joe.

3224
01:29:50,780 --> 01:29:51,800
That's hilarious.

3225
01:29:52,910 --> 01:29:53,591
Fuck that Eddie.

3226
01:29:53,591 --> 01:29:54,424
Yay.

3227
01:29:57,420 --> 01:29:59,820
This cat Zingano smacks a drunk guy.

3228
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:05,670
Cat Zingano around 10
I'm trying to scream.

3229
01:30:08,250 --> 01:30:09,083
Hmm.

3230
01:30:09,140 --> 01:30:10,690
Not motivated enough to look for it.

3231
01:30:10,720 --> 01:30:11,231
Oh my God.

3232
01:30:11,231 --> 01:30:12,460
You're the one who brought it up,

3233
01:30:14,230 --> 01:30:15,650
man.

3234
01:30:16,430 --> 01:30:17,290
I'm going to find it.

3235
01:30:17,291 --> 01:30:18,490
I'm not interested man.

3236
01:30:18,491 --> 01:30:19,000
At work.

3237
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:23,110
Just talking about an instance after a
fight where she screamed at the end of

3238
01:30:23,111 --> 01:30:23,990
every is a fight.

3239
01:30:24,310 --> 01:30:24,940
Okay.

3240
01:30:24,940 --> 01:30:26,920
Maybe it's just like a 15 second clip.

3241
01:30:27,250 --> 01:30:27,851
It probably,

3242
01:30:27,851 --> 01:30:31,120
is it just not on youtube
as cat Zingano scream yet?

3243
01:30:31,270 --> 01:30:32,710
Maybe it will be now after this.

3244
01:30:32,950 --> 01:30:34,590
It will be after this summer.

3245
01:30:34,591 --> 01:30:35,424
We'll probably hear,

3246
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:38,290
I'll have faith and Jamie's going
to find that motherfucking screen.

3247
01:30:38,350 --> 01:30:39,280
I have faith he's not.

3248
01:30:39,640 --> 01:30:42,340
I have been looking at
and he's on it right now.

3249
01:30:42,710 --> 01:30:42,950
He's,

3250
01:30:42,950 --> 01:30:44,860
I remember remember who it was.

3251
01:30:44,861 --> 01:30:45,310
Man,

3252
01:30:45,310 --> 01:30:49,120
it might have been a Amanda Nunez
who was her last fight blood.

3253
01:30:49,121 --> 01:30:49,811
Once she won,

3254
01:30:49,811 --> 01:30:51,160
she fucking roared.

3255
01:30:53,230 --> 01:30:54,580
She roars like an animal.

3256
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:56,591
And I was like,

3257
01:30:56,591 --> 01:30:57,550
she's an animal.

3258
01:30:57,700 --> 01:30:58,960
It was like primal,

3259
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:00,460
like a half a k Dodson.

3260
01:31:00,540 --> 01:31:00,781
Yes.

3261
01:31:00,781 --> 01:31:01,614
Girl.

3262
01:31:03,010 --> 01:31:04,390
Are those girls talk shit about her?

3263
01:31:04,391 --> 01:31:05,224
It's hilarious.

3264
01:31:05,370 --> 01:31:05,710
They go,

3265
01:31:05,710 --> 01:31:05,891
oh,

3266
01:31:05,891 --> 01:31:06,990
she's got a thick ways.

3267
01:31:07,130 --> 01:31:07,330
Oh,

3268
01:31:07,330 --> 01:31:08,200
she's kind of fat.

3269
01:31:08,410 --> 01:31:09,160
Listen.

3270
01:31:09,160 --> 01:31:10,600
That's what guys like.

3271
01:31:10,660 --> 01:31:12,580
We like girls a little bit fat.

3272
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:12,760
No,

3273
01:31:12,760 --> 01:31:13,241
but the hips,

3274
01:31:13,241 --> 01:31:14,800
the waist ratio is shut the fuck.

3275
01:31:14,801 --> 01:31:15,010
No,

3276
01:31:15,010 --> 01:31:15,161
no,

3277
01:31:15,161 --> 01:31:15,311
no,

3278
01:31:15,311 --> 01:31:15,461
no,

3279
01:31:15,461 --> 01:31:15,851
you're right.

3280
01:31:15,851 --> 01:31:18,430
Cause she was just the third girl.

3281
01:31:18,431 --> 01:31:19,264
Hey Hollywood,

3282
01:31:19,310 --> 01:31:20,290
you a little boy.

3283
01:31:20,570 --> 01:31:21,403
Oh dare you.

3284
01:31:21,500 --> 01:31:21,730
No,

3285
01:31:21,730 --> 01:31:21,940
no,

3286
01:31:21,940 --> 01:31:22,720
no.

3287
01:31:22,720 --> 01:31:23,330
That's true.

3288
01:31:23,330 --> 01:31:23,860
Ways away.

3289
01:31:23,860 --> 01:31:24,840
She's very different.

3290
01:31:24,841 --> 01:31:25,674
Huge.

3291
01:31:27,880 --> 01:31:28,713
She's perfect.

3292
01:31:28,970 --> 01:31:29,740
But you know,

3293
01:31:29,740 --> 01:31:31,150
if you're gonna like
break it down for real,

3294
01:31:31,151 --> 01:31:31,331
like,

3295
01:31:31,331 --> 01:31:31,571
man,

3296
01:31:31,571 --> 01:31:33,880
you look that she doesn't have a like a,

3297
01:31:33,910 --> 01:31:34,601
like the chicks.

3298
01:31:34,601 --> 01:31:39,150
Have you ever or do you follow
like a squat guides on ign?

3299
01:31:39,180 --> 01:31:40,040
You see this fall?

3300
01:31:40,240 --> 01:31:42,030
Brendan's not a man.

3301
01:31:42,580 --> 01:31:43,413
That's cool.

3302
01:31:44,300 --> 01:31:46,000
Hip to ask ratio and girls.

3303
01:31:46,180 --> 01:31:46,670
Oh yeah,

3304
01:31:46,670 --> 01:31:46,931
yeah.

3305
01:31:46,931 --> 01:31:49,150
Just Fall Brennan Shops and Oh yeah,

3306
01:31:49,250 --> 01:31:50,083
you're right.

3307
01:31:50,470 --> 01:31:50,820
No,

3308
01:31:50,820 --> 01:31:51,230
no.

3309
01:31:51,230 --> 01:31:52,061
She's brought it up.

3310
01:31:52,061 --> 01:31:52,894
She's a little thick.

3311
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:57,960
She's a little thing you would fucking
guts for a little Kate Hudson's son.

3312
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:00,873
Yeah.

3313
01:32:00,910 --> 01:32:01,960
It's like a straight line.

3314
01:32:02,050 --> 01:32:02,681
It's not getting,

3315
01:32:02,681 --> 01:32:02,771
no,

3316
01:32:02,771 --> 01:32:04,270
she didn't have like those sexy curves.

3317
01:32:04,271 --> 01:32:05,510
She's boxy.

3318
01:32:05,830 --> 01:32:08,530
Not saying she's not say to me.

3319
01:32:12,640 --> 01:32:12,910
Oh yeah,

3320
01:32:12,910 --> 01:32:13,743
Kate Upton.

3321
01:32:13,980 --> 01:32:15,730
Just I'm tigall biddies though.

3322
01:32:15,940 --> 01:32:17,860
Tig Old biddies they're real too.

3323
01:32:18,730 --> 01:32:19,920
She has a boxy build on,

3324
01:32:19,950 --> 01:32:22,330
I don't think she's at
sexy like a sausage.

3325
01:32:22,360 --> 01:32:22,720
Right.

3326
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:25,200
You say they are real as if
that's a good refrigerator.

3327
01:32:25,870 --> 01:32:26,703
What?

3328
01:32:27,160 --> 01:32:28,870
They're real big and they're real.

3329
01:32:29,890 --> 01:32:31,380
Real doesn't seem to be like the,

3330
01:32:31,750 --> 01:32:33,220
it's not the end thing anymore is it?

3331
01:32:33,250 --> 01:32:35,260
I don't feel like that's a benefit.

3332
01:32:35,261 --> 01:32:36,580
Like if you know what I mean?

3333
01:32:36,581 --> 01:32:37,414
I'm like,

3334
01:32:37,880 --> 01:32:40,240
they got a better way and I agree man.

3335
01:32:40,241 --> 01:32:41,074
I'm with you.

3336
01:32:41,560 --> 01:32:42,700
You like fake asses though.

3337
01:32:44,530 --> 01:32:45,363
That's so bad.

3338
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:48,520
And I will let you know the thing that
I'm mad about it is because the fucking

3339
01:32:48,521 --> 01:32:51,850
legs are like little twig legs and then
you've got this huge ridiculous ass.

3340
01:32:52,030 --> 01:32:53,430
Get your fucking life right girl.

3341
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:54,430
Do something different.

3342
01:32:54,460 --> 01:32:54,791
I don't know.

3343
01:32:54,791 --> 01:32:55,241
You see,

3344
01:32:55,241 --> 01:32:55,810
cause if you have,

3345
01:32:55,810 --> 01:32:57,040
if you're born with small titties,

3346
01:32:57,100 --> 01:32:59,530
there's nothing you could do
physically to grow those cities.

3347
01:32:59,620 --> 01:33:04,210
Get fake titties your ass just do some
squats for a couple of years and watch

3348
01:33:04,211 --> 01:33:05,044
what the fuck you eat.

3349
01:33:05,050 --> 01:33:06,390
All is showing you that you're lazy.

3350
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:08,350
Girls can reshape her body.

3351
01:33:08,650 --> 01:33:09,483
Correct.

3352
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:10,750
If she did the romance,

3353
01:33:11,210 --> 01:33:12,220
it's genetics.

3354
01:33:12,270 --> 01:33:12,850
You do ask,

3355
01:33:12,850 --> 01:33:13,100
watch.

3356
01:33:13,100 --> 01:33:13,330
You want,

3357
01:33:13,330 --> 01:33:15,070
if you have a flat ass like Mr. Burns,

3358
01:33:15,071 --> 01:33:16,210
you ain't getting a bubble.

3359
01:33:16,211 --> 01:33:17,650
But with the PR,

3360
01:33:17,680 --> 01:33:19,520
the correct squads and Tau Song,

3361
01:33:22,290 --> 01:33:24,150
attention to nutrition,

3362
01:33:24,180 --> 01:33:25,480
power lifting some shit.

3363
01:33:25,690 --> 01:33:27,550
I think you could do like who's to say,

3364
01:33:27,610 --> 01:33:32,480
I mean if this bitch went
ham on a crossfit program
is squats and nutrients shot

3365
01:33:32,500 --> 01:33:34,270
testosterone right into the glutes.

3366
01:33:34,900 --> 01:33:35,990
Well now directly,

3367
01:33:36,280 --> 01:33:36,870
directly.

3368
01:33:36,870 --> 01:33:39,100
I need some alternate that might do it.

3369
01:33:39,310 --> 01:33:40,020
Ask the trainers,

3370
01:33:40,020 --> 01:33:40,853
the stripe.

3371
01:33:41,470 --> 01:33:43,960
If I bring a girl with a straight
flat ass Mr. Burns style,

3372
01:33:43,961 --> 01:33:45,010
you can give her a bubble.

3373
01:33:45,011 --> 01:33:45,440
But yeah,

3374
01:33:45,440 --> 01:33:48,660
cause there's different body types and
now there's like active more fit girl.

3375
01:33:50,530 --> 01:33:55,330
Is that before and after for just butts
like flatness and curvature and all

3376
01:33:55,331 --> 01:33:55,450
that?

3377
01:33:55,450 --> 01:33:55,691
Yeah.

3378
01:33:55,691 --> 01:33:55,881
Yeah.

3379
01:33:55,881 --> 01:33:59,560
And I've seen some pretty crazy
before and after shots for sure.

3380
01:33:59,740 --> 01:34:01,260
Based on base on Yay.

3381
01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:01,690
Yeah,

3382
01:34:01,690 --> 01:34:03,250
ass and hips to waist ratio.

3383
01:34:03,251 --> 01:34:04,084
All that.

3384
01:34:05,390 --> 01:34:06,940
There's nothing so good.

3385
01:34:07,080 --> 01:34:08,660
I agree with what her son die.

3386
01:34:11,650 --> 01:34:13,170
While you're eating chips on the mic,

3387
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:18,370
you are just joining this chips though.

3388
01:34:19,330 --> 01:34:20,163
You're destroying those.

3389
01:34:20,170 --> 01:34:20,401
Good,

3390
01:34:20,401 --> 01:34:20,840
Huh?

3391
01:34:20,840 --> 01:34:22,360
I those are the salt and vinegar ones.

3392
01:34:22,870 --> 01:34:23,703
Those are good.

3393
01:34:24,650 --> 01:34:26,080
I have the same ones here.

3394
01:34:26,890 --> 01:34:27,490
How does,

3395
01:34:27,490 --> 01:34:29,320
how does it feel when you,

3396
01:34:29,590 --> 01:34:32,350
when you first started at not doing UFC?

3397
01:34:32,351 --> 01:34:35,330
Is that the first shows where they
started branching out and using carelogic

3398
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:36,850
watching it's better.

3399
01:34:36,851 --> 01:34:37,210
Right?

3400
01:34:37,210 --> 01:34:38,043
I like watching,

3401
01:34:38,240 --> 01:34:40,420
I mean I like commentary
but I'm like watch them too.

3402
01:34:42,820 --> 01:34:46,000
If for whatever reason I never
worked for the UFC again.

3403
01:34:46,420 --> 01:34:48,640
I would probably watch this as
many fights are pretty close.

3404
01:34:48,641 --> 01:34:50,260
I wouldn't watch the prelims as much,

3405
01:34:50,530 --> 01:34:54,610
like the early prelims cause I just
don't have six hours on most days to be

3406
01:34:54,670 --> 01:34:55,840
watching fights.

3407
01:34:56,290 --> 01:34:58,190
But for purposes

3408
01:34:58,190 --> 01:34:59,240
like how much do I enjoy it?

3409
01:34:59,241 --> 01:35:01,130
I fucking love watching the fights on TV.

3410
01:35:01,700 --> 01:35:03,380
I like the fact that I
don't have to go anywhere.

3411
01:35:03,410 --> 01:35:05,930
I'm home hanging out with my friends,

3412
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:07,100
having a couple of beers,

3413
01:35:07,101 --> 01:35:07,791
watching fights.

3414
01:35:07,791 --> 01:35:08,624
I love it.

3415
01:35:08,720 --> 01:35:08,961
I mean,

3416
01:35:08,961 --> 01:35:10,070
I love working for the UFC,

3417
01:35:10,071 --> 01:35:11,180
but I love watching too.

3418
01:35:11,540 --> 01:35:12,390
I wouldn't mind it off.

3419
01:35:12,410 --> 01:35:13,243
I didn't do it again.

3420
01:35:14,240 --> 01:35:18,660
I'd rather do this and sit front row at
any live event as a Chinese men all day.

3421
01:35:18,740 --> 01:35:19,573
That's true.

3422
01:35:19,970 --> 01:35:22,160
How often do you actually rewatch a show?

3423
01:35:22,161 --> 01:35:25,220
You just occasionally a watch,

3424
01:35:25,221 --> 01:35:27,920
like big fights or big moments,

3425
01:35:27,921 --> 01:35:29,690
like something that was
like really special to me.

3426
01:35:30,020 --> 01:35:31,580
I just been some fights where I watched,

3427
01:35:31,581 --> 01:35:32,210
uh,

3428
01:35:32,210 --> 01:35:33,620
I watched the same fight like two,

3429
01:35:33,630 --> 01:35:35,000
three times in a row just to,

3430
01:35:35,001 --> 01:35:35,331
you know,

3431
01:35:35,331 --> 01:35:37,640
see like wild transitions or some shit,

3432
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:38,431
you know,

3433
01:35:38,431 --> 01:35:40,520
depending on what the fight was like,

3434
01:35:40,710 --> 01:35:40,950
you know,

3435
01:35:40,950 --> 01:35:41,990
what was going on in the fight.

3436
01:35:41,991 --> 01:35:42,860
It was so interesting.

3437
01:35:44,370 --> 01:35:44,760
Powerful.

3438
01:35:44,760 --> 01:35:45,500
Neil Magni,

3439
01:35:45,500 --> 01:35:50,500
Neil Magni as your boy Gizelle up in
this bitch on that tough contract.

3440
01:35:51,741 --> 01:35:52,071
Gotta work.

3441
01:35:52,071 --> 01:35:53,210
That motherfucker off.

3442
01:35:54,740 --> 01:35:56,030
That struggle is real on that.

3443
01:35:56,031 --> 01:35:56,970
Tough struggles.

3444
01:35:57,140 --> 01:35:57,890
Real.

3445
01:35:57,890 --> 01:35:58,723
Tell us about it.

3446
01:35:59,030 --> 01:35:59,863
Tell us about it.

3447
01:35:59,930 --> 01:36:00,291
I mean,

3448
01:36:00,291 --> 01:36:04,040
I was fighting no gear for an eight
and eight when WCL got my ass whooped.

3449
01:36:04,041 --> 01:36:06,140
Came back on the plane with 8 million.

3450
01:36:08,180 --> 01:36:08,840
Wait a minute.

3451
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:09,320
Eight,

3452
01:36:09,320 --> 01:36:11,360
eight grand in eight grade
and thousand dollars.

3453
01:36:11,361 --> 01:36:11,960
Yep.

3454
01:36:11,960 --> 01:36:13,220
Just stop and think of that.

3455
01:36:13,670 --> 01:36:17,960
Go to South America and
fight a world champion.

3456
01:36:18,350 --> 01:36:20,600
He's a world champion.

3457
01:36:20,720 --> 01:36:21,200
Legend.

3458
01:36:21,200 --> 01:36:25,910
Noguera is the fucking first guy ever.

3459
01:36:25,970 --> 01:36:28,160
There was a heavyweight
that had a wicked guard.

3460
01:36:28,490 --> 01:36:31,970
I mean Noguera is the
former pride champion.

3461
01:36:32,330 --> 01:36:33,920
Legendary wars.

3462
01:36:33,921 --> 01:36:38,570
He fucking arm barred Bob Sapp and when
the craziest fights the world has ever

3463
01:36:38,571 --> 01:36:38,770
known,

3464
01:36:38,770 --> 01:36:42,380
you're fighting him and
guess who the fuck this guy?

3465
01:36:42,410 --> 01:36:43,490
Super cocky too.

3466
01:36:43,940 --> 01:36:44,773
That idea.

3467
01:36:45,030 --> 01:36:45,830
Bad idea.

3468
01:36:45,830 --> 01:36:50,370
Then I fought cro cop for 10 and 10
after taxes on the Nogueira fight.

3469
01:36:50,380 --> 01:36:52,850
You're looking at it like 2,800 yeah,

3470
01:36:52,851 --> 01:36:53,061
no,

3471
01:36:53,061 --> 01:36:54,240
I basically paid for the fight.

3472
01:36:54,241 --> 01:36:54,810
No idea.

3473
01:36:54,810 --> 01:36:55,051
I was like,

3474
01:36:55,051 --> 01:36:55,711
thank you sir.

3475
01:36:55,711 --> 01:36:56,544
Here you go.

3476
01:36:58,350 --> 01:36:58,561
Yeah.

3477
01:36:58,561 --> 01:36:59,311
I fought cro cop,

3478
01:36:59,311 --> 01:37:00,510
I think he was 10 and 10

3479
01:37:02,730 --> 01:37:05,880
and then had to have after that fight
that to have reconstructive nose surgery,

3480
01:37:06,240 --> 01:37:06,421
Cro,

3481
01:37:06,421 --> 01:37:07,254
cop make that fight.

3482
01:37:08,580 --> 01:37:11,130
He got paid bay,

3483
01:37:12,150 --> 01:37:14,370
had a fanny pack on and no fucks given.

3484
01:37:14,570 --> 01:37:14,881
I was like,

3485
01:37:14,881 --> 01:37:15,840
cool you one man.

3486
01:37:16,100 --> 01:37:17,460
Nice a bonus check.

3487
01:37:17,790 --> 01:37:18,623
He got paid.

3488
01:37:18,900 --> 01:37:19,441
It's cro cop.

3489
01:37:19,441 --> 01:37:20,280
He deserves to get paid.

3490
01:37:20,281 --> 01:37:21,114
You know what I'm saying?

3491
01:37:21,420 --> 01:37:23,340
I didn't deserve that money at the time.

3492
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:24,420
You know I,

3493
01:37:24,420 --> 01:37:27,810
I think y'all had four fights in
the UFC fight fights in the UFC.

3494
01:37:27,870 --> 01:37:28,860
You gotta get your nose fixed.

3495
01:37:29,160 --> 01:37:31,080
Reconstructive nose surgery after cro cop,

3496
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:35,610
he hit me with the elbow and it shattered
my nose like completely shattered

3497
01:37:35,611 --> 01:37:36,444
everything in my nose.

3498
01:37:36,660 --> 01:37:38,460
Second round two I was like,

3499
01:37:38,461 --> 01:37:39,510
why in the fuck am I so tired?

3500
01:37:39,511 --> 01:37:41,550
I'm in great shape and I
couldn't breathe out my nose.

3501
01:37:42,060 --> 01:37:44,700
Blood just gushing down my throat.

3502
01:37:45,180 --> 01:37:45,751
How'd they fix it?

3503
01:37:45,751 --> 01:37:47,700
What they have to do a,

3504
01:37:47,701 --> 01:37:48,361
they went in,

3505
01:37:48,361 --> 01:37:51,540
they put like some mesh thing in it
cause all the bones were so fractured and

3506
01:37:51,541 --> 01:37:54,150
like tiny fractures put
some mesh thing in it.

3507
01:37:55,080 --> 01:37:57,360
I was trying to get a legit
nose job was like Yo doc,

3508
01:37:57,361 --> 01:37:58,194
take a little,

3509
01:37:59,010 --> 01:38:01,410
take a little off the
tip warm under the knife.

3510
01:38:01,411 --> 01:38:01,770
Doug,

3511
01:38:01,770 --> 01:38:03,120
it makes me look good.

3512
01:38:03,220 --> 01:38:03,481
He's like,

3513
01:38:03,481 --> 01:38:03,851
Nah,

3514
01:38:03,851 --> 01:38:04,684
that's not what I do.

3515
01:38:05,160 --> 01:38:05,731
Oh yeah,

3516
01:38:05,731 --> 01:38:07,380
you don't want them to give
you some weird fucking,

3517
01:38:07,990 --> 01:38:11,340
they put these brackets up there
and stitch demand so wouldn't move.

3518
01:38:11,341 --> 01:38:13,290
I have to chill like that for six weeks.

3519
01:38:13,360 --> 01:38:14,910
It was the most pain I've ever been in.

3520
01:38:15,590 --> 01:38:16,980
Pop and painkillers every day.

3521
01:38:17,250 --> 01:38:18,300
Got Addicted to them.

3522
01:38:18,790 --> 01:38:19,550
Take it to him.

3523
01:38:19,550 --> 01:38:19,721
No,

3524
01:38:19,721 --> 01:38:20,281
she does that.

3525
01:38:20,281 --> 01:38:21,114
A doctor who was like,

3526
01:38:21,240 --> 01:38:21,451
oh,

3527
01:38:21,451 --> 01:38:22,021
I'm cool.

3528
01:38:22,021 --> 01:38:22,620
I'm hip.

3529
01:38:22,620 --> 01:38:24,960
Here's 200 oxycontin.

3530
01:38:24,961 --> 01:38:25,201
I was like,

3531
01:38:25,201 --> 01:38:26,034
hell yeah.

3532
01:38:26,490 --> 01:38:27,560
Got The things taken out.

3533
01:38:27,570 --> 01:38:28,051
Next thing I know,

3534
01:38:28,051 --> 01:38:30,240
I'm still filling the prescription,

3535
01:38:30,270 --> 01:38:31,590
pop them every single day.

3536
01:38:31,591 --> 01:38:34,560
Do you mean notice finally a buddy had
to come to the house and take him from

3537
01:38:34,561 --> 01:38:35,070
me?

3538
01:38:35,070 --> 01:38:36,290
Whoa.

3539
01:38:36,440 --> 01:38:37,280
Some interventions.

3540
01:38:37,360 --> 01:38:38,220
Chicken a day,

3541
01:38:38,790 --> 01:38:39,623
probably six.

3542
01:38:39,630 --> 01:38:40,520
Oh my God.

3543
01:38:41,220 --> 01:38:42,053
Oh my God.

3544
01:38:42,990 --> 01:38:45,990
This was right after I fought cro cop.

3545
01:38:46,140 --> 01:38:49,020
I had like 10 11 months
left because of it.

3546
01:38:49,380 --> 01:38:50,910
And then I fought Nogueira after that.

3547
01:38:50,911 --> 01:38:54,270
So you had a 10 11 month layout
because of Oxycontin addiction?

3548
01:38:54,300 --> 01:38:54,571
No,

3549
01:38:54,571 --> 01:38:55,680
because I had a nose job.

3550
01:38:55,710 --> 01:38:56,340
Okay,

3551
01:38:56,340 --> 01:38:58,410
but how long did the
Oxycontin addiction kicks in?

3552
01:38:58,650 --> 01:38:59,760
Uh,

3553
01:39:00,360 --> 01:39:00,931
I was probably,

3554
01:39:00,931 --> 01:39:03,120
I was probably doing it
hardcore for like four months.

3555
01:39:03,480 --> 01:39:04,313
Four months.

3556
01:39:04,950 --> 01:39:05,340
Then I,

3557
01:39:05,340 --> 01:39:08,400
my my best friend Joe Cloth Einstein
came over and took him from it.

3558
01:39:08,401 --> 01:39:09,211
What kind of stupid shit?

3559
01:39:09,211 --> 01:39:09,841
Where are you doing on it?

3560
01:39:09,841 --> 01:39:11,160
Where they had to intervene.

3561
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:13,200
They just knew I was taking them nonstop.

3562
01:39:13,290 --> 01:39:14,123
Like what are we doing?

3563
01:39:14,130 --> 01:39:14,820
Wow.

3564
01:39:14,820 --> 01:39:15,540
They must have been.

3565
01:39:15,540 --> 01:39:17,100
Cause if you were just normal like this,

3566
01:39:17,130 --> 01:39:17,970
people wouldn't even notice.

3567
01:39:17,990 --> 01:39:18,150
No,

3568
01:39:18,150 --> 01:39:20,070
I was like this because I'm not,

3569
01:39:20,160 --> 01:39:20,993
uh,

3570
01:39:21,160 --> 01:39:21,510
I'm not,

3571
01:39:21,510 --> 01:39:23,070
I'm not going to delay everywhere.

3572
01:39:23,070 --> 01:39:24,240
Were you sleeping all day?

3573
01:39:24,270 --> 01:39:26,070
I think I was just out of it all the time.

3574
01:39:26,190 --> 01:39:27,030
Like out of it,

3575
01:39:27,060 --> 01:39:27,271
you know,

3576
01:39:27,271 --> 01:39:28,290
I'm a guy who talks a lot.

3577
01:39:28,291 --> 01:39:32,340
I think I was just kinda like this
fucking patio girls who just like chill.

3578
01:39:32,370 --> 01:39:34,900
Like I was like eventually
the beach laying around.

3579
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:35,941
That's the other thing.

3580
01:39:35,941 --> 01:39:36,990
I was super depressed on them.

3581
01:39:37,210 --> 01:39:38,250
How do you take him?

3582
01:39:38,251 --> 01:39:39,001
I got super depressed.

3583
01:39:39,001 --> 01:39:40,080
How was it coming off of him?

3584
01:39:40,230 --> 01:39:40,891
Horrible.

3585
01:39:40,891 --> 01:39:41,520
How did it feel?

3586
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:42,331
Super Itchy.

3587
01:39:42,331 --> 01:39:45,870
Has Real irritable all the time and now
you've got to fight with no gear up.

3588
01:39:45,871 --> 01:39:46,950
Perfect timing.

3589
01:39:46,980 --> 01:39:47,660
Perfect.

3590
01:39:47,660 --> 01:39:48,410
It must've been great.

3591
01:39:48,410 --> 01:39:52,290
So you fought and Idera after
you got off of the pills,

3592
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:53,280
how long after?

3593
01:39:53,630 --> 01:39:54,090
Uh,

3594
01:39:54,090 --> 01:39:54,270
I,

3595
01:39:54,270 --> 01:39:55,480
you'd have to look at the time town.

3596
01:39:55,481 --> 01:39:57,030
I'm sure people can look it up.

3597
01:39:57,150 --> 01:39:57,900
So not,

3598
01:39:57,900 --> 01:39:58,740
not far after.

3599
01:39:59,160 --> 01:40:01,770
And then so I went off those pink colors.

3600
01:40:02,190 --> 01:40:03,720
Fired my striking coach.

3601
01:40:03,780 --> 01:40:06,120
I was so this how stupid
I was as a young fighter.

3602
01:40:06,270 --> 01:40:08,460
I was so sure I was
gonna knock no glare out.

3603
01:40:08,580 --> 01:40:09,900
I didn't even go to Brazil.

3604
01:40:09,901 --> 01:40:10,734
The striking coach.

3605
01:40:11,700 --> 01:40:12,091
I was just like,

3606
01:40:12,091 --> 01:40:12,291
Nah,

3607
01:40:12,291 --> 01:40:13,930
I don't need one but
not come out out damn.

3608
01:40:14,370 --> 01:40:15,870
Fuck your head up sideways.

3609
01:40:16,710 --> 01:40:17,730
It fucked me up.

3610
01:40:18,150 --> 01:40:21,660
That's a crazy thing that a doctor could
just start prescribing them like that.

3611
01:40:21,900 --> 01:40:22,621
Isn't it weird?

3612
01:40:22,621 --> 01:40:24,870
Like you don't have to go
to them to get your pill.

3613
01:40:25,050 --> 01:40:26,820
Like you could just take all 200 at once.

3614
01:40:27,020 --> 01:40:27,510
Oh yeah.

3615
01:40:27,510 --> 01:40:28,950
Do whatever you want and you
can do whatever you want.

3616
01:40:28,980 --> 01:40:29,650
I mean,

3617
01:40:29,650 --> 01:40:33,210
that's one of the weirdest things
about like doctors giving you pills.

3618
01:40:33,280 --> 01:40:35,520
I've had surgery since like on my hand.

3619
01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:36,540
Uh,

3620
01:40:36,540 --> 01:40:39,450
they gave when my neck after trash brown
fight that game seven from my neck,

3621
01:40:39,451 --> 01:40:40,320
I don't take them anymore.

3622
01:40:40,660 --> 01:40:41,010
Really?

3623
01:40:41,010 --> 01:40:41,161
Yeah.

3624
01:40:41,161 --> 01:40:42,330
I don't fill the prescription.

3625
01:40:42,360 --> 01:40:42,631
You just,

3626
01:40:42,631 --> 01:40:45,270
they take you to say
I'll deal with the pain.

3627
01:40:45,510 --> 01:40:45,930
Yeah.

3628
01:40:45,930 --> 01:40:48,780
I've got three surgeries
and I don't take him

3629
01:40:50,550 --> 01:40:51,510
so bad for you man.

3630
01:40:51,540 --> 01:40:52,373
Fuck with them.

3631
01:40:53,880 --> 01:40:54,040
We've

3632
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:55,990
had issues with substances
in the past too.

3633
01:40:56,350 --> 01:40:57,183
Yeah.

3634
01:40:57,480 --> 01:40:58,241
But I figured it's like,

3635
01:40:58,241 --> 01:40:59,230
it's a trick anyway.

3636
01:40:59,380 --> 01:40:59,711
It just,

3637
01:40:59,711 --> 01:41:00,051
it just,

3638
01:41:00,051 --> 01:41:00,390
it,

3639
01:41:00,390 --> 01:41:02,380
it makes your mind pretend
you're somewhere else.

3640
01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:03,880
The pain still all there.

3641
01:41:03,881 --> 01:41:05,230
It's like a distraction and I'm like,

3642
01:41:05,380 --> 01:41:05,741
fuck it.

3643
01:41:05,741 --> 01:41:09,880
I'll freeze it out with ice or I'll take
extra Tylenol or whatever for pain and

3644
01:41:09,881 --> 01:41:10,960
I'll just fucking get through it.

3645
01:41:11,140 --> 01:41:11,291
Yeah,

3646
01:41:11,291 --> 01:41:11,651
for sure.

3647
01:41:11,651 --> 01:41:12,650
Do you still have those bills though?

3648
01:41:12,710 --> 01:41:13,543
Where

3649
01:41:15,960 --> 01:41:18,040
I went to him book my knee surgeries with,

3650
01:41:18,041 --> 01:41:18,330
uh,

3651
01:41:18,330 --> 01:41:18,520
when,

3652
01:41:18,520 --> 01:41:19,090
no pills,

3653
01:41:19,090 --> 01:41:19,800
no nothing.

3654
01:41:19,800 --> 01:41:20,040
Because,

3655
01:41:20,040 --> 01:41:20,230
uh,

3656
01:41:20,230 --> 01:41:23,350
when I had my ACL done the first
knee surgery and my left knee,

3657
01:41:23,650 --> 01:41:24,460
or they gave me,

3658
01:41:24,460 --> 01:41:25,390
I don't remember what it was.

3659
01:41:25,391 --> 01:41:26,710
It was your Vicodin or Percocet?

3660
01:41:26,711 --> 01:41:27,340
I don't remember.

3661
01:41:27,340 --> 01:41:28,900
I want up selling them at the pool hall.

3662
01:41:29,170 --> 01:41:29,441
But,

3663
01:41:29,441 --> 01:41:29,800
uh,

3664
01:41:29,800 --> 01:41:30,550
I took it,

3665
01:41:30,550 --> 01:41:33,130
I took one hit and I was so out of it.

3666
01:41:33,131 --> 01:41:33,431
I was like,

3667
01:41:33,431 --> 01:41:34,660
I'd rather have the pain.

3668
01:41:34,900 --> 01:41:35,770
I'd rather have the pill.

3669
01:41:35,771 --> 01:41:36,604
I love that.

3670
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:36,911
Oh,

3671
01:41:36,911 --> 01:41:38,140
I don't like it at all.

3672
01:41:38,200 --> 01:41:38,951
I don't like it at all.

3673
01:41:38,951 --> 01:41:39,370
I don't,

3674
01:41:39,370 --> 01:41:41,020
but I said I don't like it at all.

3675
01:41:41,021 --> 01:41:43,180
But I used to fucking love Nyquil,

3676
01:41:43,450 --> 01:41:44,420
the real nyquil.

3677
01:41:44,670 --> 01:41:45,500
Cody's daughter.

3678
01:41:45,500 --> 01:41:48,770
I was a little kid and just going
into a hallucinogenic state off that

3679
01:41:49,190 --> 01:41:50,240
awesome dude.

3680
01:41:50,241 --> 01:41:51,140
I took it once,

3681
01:41:51,141 --> 01:41:51,590
Ramy,

3682
01:41:51,590 --> 01:41:52,850
the last time I took it,

3683
01:41:52,880 --> 01:41:54,200
it was more than 10 years ago,

3684
01:41:54,290 --> 01:41:55,123
but I was sick.

3685
01:41:55,280 --> 01:41:55,671
And,

3686
01:41:55,671 --> 01:41:55,851
uh,

3687
01:41:55,851 --> 01:41:58,070
I got ahold of someone's before
they took the coding out.

3688
01:41:58,310 --> 01:41:58,671
And,

3689
01:41:58,671 --> 01:41:58,881
uh,

3690
01:41:58,881 --> 01:41:59,691
I just felt like shit.

3691
01:41:59,691 --> 01:41:59,901
I was like,

3692
01:41:59,901 --> 01:42:00,261
what do we got?

3693
01:42:00,261 --> 01:42:01,040
I got some Nyquil.

3694
01:42:01,040 --> 01:42:01,720
I'll take this.

3695
01:42:01,720 --> 01:42:06,720
I hadn't taken it since I was a kid
and I just melted into that bed.

3696
01:42:07,130 --> 01:42:08,650
So before,

3697
01:42:08,660 --> 01:42:11,380
before the rappers made
it famous ain't doing,

3698
01:42:11,530 --> 01:42:14,870
one's doing that little
Wayne since it felt so good.

3699
01:42:14,960 --> 01:42:16,460
I felt so good to that shit.

3700
01:42:16,461 --> 01:42:16,761
Right now.

3701
01:42:16,761 --> 01:42:17,360
I'm not gonna lie to you.

3702
01:42:17,360 --> 01:42:17,841
How's your boy,

3703
01:42:17,841 --> 01:42:19,820
Neil Magni you would drink some Syrah,

3704
01:42:19,821 --> 01:42:21,320
but you won't fuck with some oxycontin's.

3705
01:42:21,321 --> 01:42:21,531
Yeah,

3706
01:42:21,531 --> 01:42:22,364
that's right.

3707
01:42:22,630 --> 01:42:23,700
Do you think

3708
01:42:27,870 --> 01:42:28,150
Neil?

3709
01:42:28,150 --> 01:42:29,390
Maggie's looking good man.

3710
01:42:29,490 --> 01:42:29,991
He's so,

3711
01:42:29,991 --> 01:42:31,790
and all at this altitude is his,

3712
01:42:31,791 --> 01:42:32,210
uh,

3713
01:42:32,210 --> 01:42:33,480
cardio is going to be beast.

3714
01:42:33,500 --> 01:42:36,000
It's cardio is always
nasty and lives up here.

3715
01:42:36,050 --> 01:42:39,590
Trains up here and he's got
a style where he never like,

3716
01:42:39,740 --> 01:42:42,260
he's not burning out any
fast twitch muscle fibers.

3717
01:42:42,261 --> 01:42:45,380
He stays on you at like a 75% pace.

3718
01:42:45,410 --> 01:42:46,243
Always.

3719
01:42:46,400 --> 01:42:47,810
His biggest thing is confidence,

3720
01:42:47,811 --> 01:42:47,961
man.

3721
01:42:47,961 --> 01:42:49,010
He's getting more confident.

3722
01:42:49,011 --> 01:42:50,120
He's always had the skill.

3723
01:42:50,360 --> 01:42:51,320
It's just confidence.

3724
01:42:51,620 --> 01:42:53,660
The only thing that's
missing with Neil Magni,

3725
01:42:53,661 --> 01:42:56,120
it's like knockout power is you
know what's missing and he's just,

3726
01:42:56,121 --> 01:42:57,170
he's just not mean.

3727
01:42:57,230 --> 01:42:57,801
Neil's never,

3728
01:42:57,801 --> 01:42:58,880
he's not mean.

3729
01:42:59,060 --> 01:43:01,130
I nicknamed him the fucking Gazelle.

3730
01:43:01,480 --> 01:43:01,880
There's not,

3731
01:43:01,880 --> 01:43:02,190
I mean,

3732
01:43:02,190 --> 01:43:04,010
Gizelle doesn't have an
aggressive bone in his body.

3733
01:43:04,250 --> 01:43:05,490
He nicknamed me like Gazelle,

3734
01:43:07,400 --> 01:43:07,911
but he's,

3735
01:43:07,911 --> 01:43:09,580
he's a very competent fighter.

3736
01:43:09,590 --> 01:43:11,990
Like he definitely knows
how to fight huge reach.

3737
01:43:12,020 --> 01:43:12,853
Good Cardio.

3738
01:43:12,860 --> 01:43:13,790
He's a beast man.

3739
01:43:14,360 --> 01:43:15,350
He's just smart fighters.

3740
01:43:15,351 --> 01:43:15,621
Fights.

3741
01:43:15,621 --> 01:43:16,371
Very smart.

3742
01:43:16,371 --> 01:43:17,204
Very smart.

3743
01:43:19,250 --> 01:43:19,401
Yeah.

3744
01:43:19,401 --> 01:43:20,181
He's one of those dudes.

3745
01:43:20,181 --> 01:43:22,410
It's on a win streak to know
we're talking about no one talks.

3746
01:43:22,411 --> 01:43:23,360
So I think he's on a seven,

3747
01:43:23,420 --> 01:43:23,781
seven,

3748
01:43:23,781 --> 01:43:24,350
five,

3749
01:43:24,350 --> 01:43:24,921
six,

3750
01:43:24,921 --> 01:43:25,221
six,

3751
01:43:25,221 --> 01:43:26,090
five [inaudible] seven.

3752
01:43:26,091 --> 01:43:26,420
Yeah,

3753
01:43:26,420 --> 01:43:29,720
I mean that's amazing in
this division and well,

3754
01:43:29,721 --> 01:43:30,890
he's on the main card,

3755
01:43:30,891 --> 01:43:32,100
so someone's talking about it.

3756
01:43:32,470 --> 01:43:32,780
Well,

3757
01:43:32,780 --> 01:43:33,600
he's in Boston.

3758
01:43:33,600 --> 01:43:34,231
He's in Denver.

3759
01:43:34,231 --> 01:43:34,851
Around Denver.

3760
01:43:34,851 --> 01:43:35,071
Yeah.

3761
01:43:35,071 --> 01:43:35,510
And it's a,

3762
01:43:35,510 --> 01:43:36,800
it's a finite Denver.

3763
01:43:36,830 --> 01:43:37,310
Yeah,

3764
01:43:37,310 --> 01:43:38,143
he lived there.

3765
01:43:39,930 --> 01:43:40,310
Yeah.

3766
01:43:40,310 --> 01:43:42,440
He lived with named
Mark Cart for every man.

3767
01:43:42,470 --> 01:43:43,600
I think you getting home place now,

3768
01:43:43,610 --> 01:43:44,361
like better guys.

3769
01:43:44,361 --> 01:43:46,070
What did you think
about Nate's last fight?

3770
01:43:46,160 --> 01:43:47,090
Is that hard to watch?

3771
01:43:47,240 --> 01:43:48,200
Super hard to watch.

3772
01:43:48,201 --> 01:43:49,610
I sent him a text and said,

3773
01:43:49,611 --> 01:43:49,731
hey,

3774
01:43:49,731 --> 01:43:51,140
I need you to come in for a podcast.

3775
01:43:51,320 --> 01:43:52,153
Rogan.

3776
01:43:52,350 --> 01:43:53,480
I'm just kidding.

3777
01:43:54,100 --> 01:43:54,481
No,

3778
01:43:54,481 --> 01:43:55,940
but for real.

3779
01:43:55,941 --> 01:43:58,020
So I don't think you'd be surprised.

3780
01:44:02,180 --> 01:44:03,700
I've learned or evolved through this.

3781
01:44:03,701 --> 01:44:04,220
I don't know.

3782
01:44:04,220 --> 01:44:05,070
You know what though?

3783
01:44:05,330 --> 01:44:06,163
Can you tell like,

3784
01:44:06,170 --> 01:44:08,000
I think it's time to go on Joe's podcast.

3785
01:44:08,090 --> 01:44:09,230
That's what I tell him.

3786
01:44:09,390 --> 01:44:09,830
No,

3787
01:44:09,830 --> 01:44:10,680
I wasn't doing,

3788
01:44:10,710 --> 01:44:11,543
unless I love them.

3789
01:44:11,760 --> 01:44:12,980
It's tough for me to watch,

3790
01:44:12,981 --> 01:44:13,191
man.

3791
01:44:13,191 --> 01:44:14,450
We would need a specialty.

3792
01:44:14,540 --> 01:44:15,510
Nate was my hero.

3793
01:44:15,890 --> 01:44:16,611
I missed that fight.

3794
01:44:16,611 --> 01:44:16,991
What happened?

3795
01:44:16,991 --> 01:44:17,900
He just looked bad,

3796
01:44:17,910 --> 01:44:22,910
like as slow is looked really fucking
good to not taking anything away from

3797
01:44:23,810 --> 01:44:24,620
Nate.

3798
01:44:24,620 --> 01:44:26,240
I think Nate's a really good fighter,

3799
01:44:26,420 --> 01:44:30,230
but Brad to Varas is becoming
like something special right now.

3800
01:44:30,260 --> 01:44:30,861
I get that.

3801
01:44:30,861 --> 01:44:31,694
But Nate,

3802
01:44:31,730 --> 01:44:32,061
Nate,

3803
01:44:32,061 --> 01:44:32,840
more cart ne,

3804
01:44:32,840 --> 01:44:33,710
a young Nate.

3805
01:44:33,740 --> 01:44:36,510
Nate in his prime was a fuck B's.

3806
01:44:36,940 --> 01:44:38,090
You're the best ever.

3807
01:44:38,150 --> 01:44:38,570
Really.

3808
01:44:38,570 --> 01:44:39,560
He's a very good fighter.

3809
01:44:39,561 --> 01:44:42,630
If you watch the combination that he
finished Tyron Woodley off with and strike

3810
01:44:42,631 --> 01:44:44,420
force when he won the title in straight.

3811
01:44:44,720 --> 01:44:45,410
Dude,

3812
01:44:45,410 --> 01:44:48,380
that's some video combat
ship spinning elbow.

3813
01:44:48,440 --> 01:44:48,950
Yeah,

3814
01:44:48,950 --> 01:44:49,850
he looked beautiful.

3815
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:50,271
Look,

3816
01:44:50,271 --> 01:44:50,590
Nate,

3817
01:44:50,590 --> 01:44:53,960
it's been around a long time and a fight
since he was 17 you know who gave me

3818
01:44:53,961 --> 01:44:55,940
insight into Nate is you?

3819
01:44:56,150 --> 01:45:00,020
When you told me that he was one of his
main sparring partners was Shane Carwyn.

3820
01:45:00,080 --> 01:45:01,240
It was me and Shane and I.

3821
01:45:01,250 --> 01:45:03,490
When is the only three of
us everyday in the chill,

3822
01:45:05,170 --> 01:45:09,150
but just thinking someone fighting
at one 70 who spars with shake car.

3823
01:45:09,170 --> 01:45:11,120
I mean maybe it was one
of the five at the time,

3824
01:45:11,240 --> 01:45:14,000
but when Nate was fighting in [inaudible]
85 he wasn't really cutting any

3825
01:45:14,001 --> 01:45:14,690
weight.

3826
01:45:14,690 --> 01:45:15,081
No,

3827
01:45:15,081 --> 01:45:16,930
he walked around like one 92 yeah,

3828
01:45:16,970 --> 01:45:18,260
that's what he's fighting with me.

3829
01:45:18,290 --> 01:45:18,681
Shane,

3830
01:45:18,681 --> 01:45:20,780
who was walking around at two 80 me.

3831
01:45:20,781 --> 01:45:22,700
I was too wise to just say what number,

3832
01:45:22,701 --> 01:45:23,534
what was that number?

3833
01:45:23,780 --> 01:45:24,351
She ain't,

3834
01:45:24,351 --> 01:45:27,170
Shane was assault to
80 that hurts my face.

3835
01:45:28,100 --> 01:45:31,540
That's like the greatest training
partner to work on footwork.

3836
01:45:31,960 --> 01:45:34,900
But that's how I got all my,

3837
01:45:36,410 --> 01:45:36,681
yeah,

3838
01:45:36,681 --> 01:45:38,240
that's not good for your brain.

3839
01:45:38,450 --> 01:45:39,283
Nope.

3840
01:45:39,380 --> 01:45:40,820
It's really not good for your brain.

3841
01:45:41,020 --> 01:45:42,590
I was saying it was the
hardest he'd ever been.

3842
01:45:42,610 --> 01:45:43,490
He is like,

3843
01:45:43,880 --> 01:45:47,650
here's in a clinch and like he's got an
under hook and they're hot and he says

3844
01:45:47,870 --> 01:45:48,703
just this far away.

3845
01:45:50,570 --> 01:45:51,200
And he's like,

3846
01:45:51,200 --> 01:45:53,480
and fucking Bell Rung like fuck,

3847
01:45:53,550 --> 01:45:54,650
nobody can standard.

3848
01:45:55,090 --> 01:45:55,923
Dang.

3849
01:45:56,180 --> 01:45:58,220
He's used to stand and bang with Shane.

3850
01:45:58,410 --> 01:45:59,930
I'd like leave this dude.

3851
01:46:00,080 --> 01:46:01,010
Not good man.

3852
01:46:01,080 --> 01:46:01,913
Oh,

3853
01:46:02,570 --> 01:46:04,070
that explains a lot.

3854
01:46:06,700 --> 01:46:08,010
All of us are just punks.

3855
01:46:08,600 --> 01:46:10,040
Just stop and think about everybody.

3856
01:46:10,041 --> 01:46:11,570
That's Shane Carlin is sparred with

3857
01:46:14,230 --> 01:46:17,090
Shane Carwyn like his hands are so stupid.

3858
01:46:17,091 --> 01:46:18,020
Big Dead.

3859
01:46:18,021 --> 01:46:19,850
Literally like lunchboxes.

3860
01:46:20,160 --> 01:46:22,760
They'll like some fucking
Thor lunchbox shit.

3861
01:46:23,400 --> 01:46:25,250
Some hammer at the end of his wrist.

3862
01:46:25,280 --> 01:46:26,520
What does he wear at four XL?

3863
01:46:26,740 --> 01:46:27,410
Yeah,

3864
01:46:27,410 --> 01:46:28,450
glove glove.

3865
01:46:28,520 --> 01:46:30,740
Ever bigger gloves then

3866
01:46:32,470 --> 01:46:33,890
change bigger than Brock.

3867
01:46:34,100 --> 01:46:34,990
That's what people don't understand.

3868
01:46:35,120 --> 01:46:36,260
Brock's lower leg.

3869
01:46:36,290 --> 01:46:38,780
He lowered Kate body part isn't that big.

3870
01:46:38,990 --> 01:46:39,641
Like his ass.

3871
01:46:39,641 --> 01:46:40,450
His quads.

3872
01:46:40,450 --> 01:46:40,730
Yeah.

3873
01:46:40,730 --> 01:46:41,930
His calves aren't that big.

3874
01:46:42,050 --> 01:46:44,210
Shane's like a fucking Mack truck.

3875
01:46:44,540 --> 01:46:45,350
Yeah.

3876
01:46:45,350 --> 01:46:46,760
Shane is a big fucking you.

3877
01:46:46,761 --> 01:46:48,380
Do you know what?

3878
01:46:48,381 --> 01:46:51,000
I would've loved to seen what happened
with Shane if he didn't have all those

3879
01:46:51,001 --> 01:46:53,850
injuries from football because
football and wrestling,

3880
01:46:54,360 --> 01:46:55,080
both of those,

3881
01:46:55,080 --> 01:46:59,300
but they're back injuries to
those back into that spinal.

3882
01:46:59,301 --> 01:46:59,940
It's fucked up.

3883
01:46:59,940 --> 01:47:01,260
All that stuff is just,

3884
01:47:01,261 --> 01:47:03,000
that's so debilitating.

3885
01:47:03,180 --> 01:47:03,460
That's,

3886
01:47:03,460 --> 01:47:05,960
it removes so much athleticism.

3887
01:47:05,970 --> 01:47:07,320
So much explosion.

3888
01:47:07,321 --> 01:47:11,190
Like a fighter becomes so different
when they have a back neck injury.

3889
01:47:11,250 --> 01:47:11,580
Rowan,

3890
01:47:11,580 --> 01:47:12,230
Shane Fug,

3891
01:47:12,230 --> 01:47:13,040
frank mayor.

3892
01:47:13,040 --> 01:47:14,010
We're in the same camp.

3893
01:47:14,190 --> 01:47:14,760
Obviously.

3894
01:47:14,760 --> 01:47:16,160
When I forget who I was getting ready for,

3895
01:47:16,170 --> 01:47:17,560
maybe cro cop or no guy,

3896
01:47:17,561 --> 01:47:18,270
I forget,

3897
01:47:18,270 --> 01:47:21,660
but Shane maybe hit mits three times.

3898
01:47:22,260 --> 01:47:23,520
Maybe training and not much.

3899
01:47:23,521 --> 01:47:24,360
Man rolled him,

3900
01:47:24,361 --> 01:47:25,710
beat the brakes off.

3901
01:47:25,711 --> 01:47:27,360
Frank didn't no flux given,

3902
01:47:27,390 --> 01:47:30,300
well he hit the gas
from the opening round.

3903
01:47:30,301 --> 01:47:31,140
We got an under hook.

3904
01:47:31,190 --> 01:47:31,980
Yeah,

3905
01:47:31,980 --> 01:47:35,250
he got him tied up and he was hitting
him with left upper cuts that just looked

3906
01:47:35,251 --> 01:47:39,120
like he might've sparred literally
three or four times at camp.

3907
01:47:39,240 --> 01:47:41,460
What was perfect cause you
know that wasn't sparring.

3908
01:47:41,461 --> 01:47:42,450
That was an ass whooping.

3909
01:47:42,810 --> 01:47:43,590
I mean he just,

3910
01:47:43,590 --> 01:47:46,110
he grabbed a hold of them
and beat the fuck out of him.

3911
01:47:46,440 --> 01:47:46,870
It was,

3912
01:47:46,870 --> 01:47:48,810
it was a hard one to
watch because that one,

3913
01:47:49,260 --> 01:47:51,990
I think he took way too many
shots and not fight me or did,

3914
01:47:51,991 --> 01:47:53,820
I mean I think that could
have been stopped earlier.

3915
01:47:54,360 --> 01:47:59,360
Just Shane's short powerful punches
were just ruthless in that fight.

3916
01:48:00,410 --> 01:48:04,080
He seemed a little too relaxed
in the clinch against the cage.

3917
01:48:04,140 --> 01:48:05,370
Well Frank's coach frank,

3918
01:48:05,371 --> 01:48:05,881
coach goes,

3919
01:48:05,881 --> 01:48:06,840
relax here.

3920
01:48:06,930 --> 01:48:07,741
Relax here.

3921
01:48:07,741 --> 01:48:08,670
You're doing fine.

3922
01:48:08,671 --> 01:48:12,000
I'll have caught one that hell no,

3923
01:48:12,001 --> 01:48:13,040
you ain't doing fine.

3924
01:48:13,140 --> 01:48:13,381
Yes.

3925
01:48:13,381 --> 01:48:13,620
Shane.

3926
01:48:13,620 --> 01:48:13,920
Carmen,

3927
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:14,753
the under hook.

3928
01:48:14,910 --> 01:48:15,391
That's it.

3929
01:48:15,391 --> 01:48:16,740
That's where he makes his living.

3930
01:48:16,980 --> 01:48:18,600
Everyone knows Shankar meets under like,

3931
01:48:18,601 --> 01:48:19,950
you better get the fuck out,

3932
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:22,290
get the fuck out outside.

3933
01:48:22,460 --> 01:48:23,940
She even like no wrestle either.

3934
01:48:24,060 --> 01:48:25,260
He didn't want to wrestle ever.

3935
01:48:25,320 --> 01:48:29,820
What is your insight with a guy like Cain
Velasquez continually getting injured?

3936
01:48:30,150 --> 01:48:31,350
What do you think that's about?

3937
01:48:32,070 --> 01:48:32,620
Listen,

3938
01:48:32,620 --> 01:48:34,170
w w with the wrestling and he,

3939
01:48:34,200 --> 01:48:35,490
how long has he been competing for?

3940
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:36,080
You know what I'm saying?

3941
01:48:36,080 --> 01:48:40,350
And blessing and now he's been
getting ready for forever for MMA.

3942
01:48:40,351 --> 01:48:41,250
Went straight into it.

3943
01:48:41,251 --> 01:48:43,020
I just think his body's never had a break.

3944
01:48:43,170 --> 01:48:44,150
Finally the body's like,

3945
01:48:44,160 --> 01:48:44,640
you know what man,

3946
01:48:44,640 --> 01:48:45,600
we can't do this anymore.

3947
01:48:45,660 --> 01:48:46,980
We just can't do this anymore.

3948
01:48:47,270 --> 01:48:47,570
You leave,

3949
01:48:47,570 --> 01:48:49,050
you guys like junior dos Santos to,

3950
01:48:49,350 --> 01:48:53,610
I mean anyone here thinks Joe Santos from
those two fights with Kane is the same

3951
01:48:53,611 --> 01:48:54,630
as fucking crazy.

3952
01:48:54,810 --> 01:48:58,260
That dude like he's just not the same
and now he just had surgery on his hand

3953
01:48:58,270 --> 01:48:59,103
and knee.

3954
01:48:59,820 --> 01:49:02,520
So junior did he just after,

3955
01:49:02,521 --> 01:49:03,331
after Steve Bay,

3956
01:49:03,331 --> 01:49:06,240
he had another surgery and he
had surgery before that fight.

3957
01:49:06,690 --> 01:49:09,390
So your body's telling you something
and eventually your body's just like,

3958
01:49:09,570 --> 01:49:10,360
we can't do.

3959
01:49:10,360 --> 01:49:12,090
You can't compete at this level anymore.

3960
01:49:13,260 --> 01:49:14,490
When you see this deep bay fight,

3961
01:49:14,491 --> 01:49:16,490
do you think that that was just steep,

3962
01:49:16,491 --> 01:49:18,750
a just getting better
and better and better?

3963
01:49:19,170 --> 01:49:22,080
Do you think it was junior sliding
off a little bit or do think it was a

3964
01:49:22,081 --> 01:49:23,070
combination of both?

3965
01:49:23,071 --> 01:49:24,090
Combination of both.

3966
01:49:24,780 --> 01:49:27,390
I think Steve Bay is that
the better I've seen Steve.

3967
01:49:27,900 --> 01:49:29,610
Steve Bay used to be a
training partner of mine.

3968
01:49:29,611 --> 01:49:31,380
I used to fly steep bay in to Denver.

3969
01:49:31,650 --> 01:49:32,400
He's a beast.

3970
01:49:32,400 --> 01:49:33,150
Steve [inaudible].

3971
01:49:33,150 --> 01:49:34,290
Steve Bay is a tough guy.

3972
01:49:34,350 --> 01:49:35,760
He looked very good in that fight too,

3973
01:49:35,820 --> 01:49:37,170
but I rose up a look better.

3974
01:49:37,171 --> 01:49:38,700
I think that really,

3975
01:49:38,790 --> 01:49:40,910
I thought that was the best
performance of steep based career.

3976
01:49:40,911 --> 01:49:41,744
I thought he rose up.

3977
01:49:42,120 --> 01:49:42,940
I mean I thought his,

3978
01:49:42,940 --> 01:49:44,670
his timing was super sharp.

3979
01:49:44,820 --> 01:49:48,250
His boxing look good in the
first round you do let your know.

3980
01:49:48,370 --> 01:49:50,980
He did take some shots but in the
first running let junior know like,

3981
01:49:50,981 --> 01:49:51,161
hey,

3982
01:49:51,161 --> 01:49:52,720
this is going to be some shit for sure.

3983
01:49:52,721 --> 01:49:53,650
Going through some shit,

3984
01:49:53,950 --> 01:49:54,191
like,

3985
01:49:54,191 --> 01:49:55,120
I don't know if you thought like,

3986
01:49:55,121 --> 01:49:55,301
oh,

3987
01:49:55,301 --> 01:49:56,650
I'm not fighting Cain Velasquez.

3988
01:49:56,800 --> 01:49:57,560
This is going to be nice.

3989
01:49:57,560 --> 01:49:58,760
We get a little bit of a break then.

3990
01:49:58,770 --> 01:49:59,020
No,

3991
01:49:59,020 --> 01:49:59,853
no breaks.

3992
01:49:59,890 --> 01:50:00,723
I'm trying to kill you.

3993
01:50:01,050 --> 01:50:01,691
I had a man,

3994
01:50:01,691 --> 01:50:02,530
it was beautiful.

3995
01:50:02,560 --> 01:50:04,570
I don't think juniors the same anymore.

3996
01:50:05,070 --> 01:50:05,710
I don't think.

3997
01:50:05,710 --> 01:50:08,290
I mean you can't get your ass
whooped for that for 10 rounds.

3998
01:50:08,291 --> 01:50:08,950
It'd be the same.

3999
01:50:08,950 --> 01:50:10,390
You just can't think
that's just what it is.

4000
01:50:10,440 --> 01:50:11,260
Yup.

4001
01:50:11,260 --> 01:50:13,330
I think you only have so
many rounds in your career.

4002
01:50:13,390 --> 01:50:15,630
It doesn't matter whether
you do it in one fight.

4003
01:50:15,640 --> 01:50:16,840
If you do five in one fight,

4004
01:50:16,841 --> 01:50:18,970
if you do one here to win this fight,

4005
01:50:19,060 --> 01:50:21,970
there's only a certain amount where
your body just says shuts it down.

4006
01:50:22,030 --> 01:50:23,740
There's a certain amount
where your body shuts it down,

4007
01:50:23,741 --> 01:50:25,090
but zero period and time,

4008
01:50:25,091 --> 01:50:27,610
which it starts declining obviously.

4009
01:50:27,850 --> 01:50:31,150
Like do you see it declining and
then they still fight for five,

4010
01:50:31,151 --> 01:50:32,120
six more years.

4011
01:50:32,280 --> 01:50:33,113
100% right.

4012
01:50:34,910 --> 01:50:35,411
Of course.

4013
01:50:35,411 --> 01:50:35,660
Right.

4014
01:50:35,660 --> 01:50:37,930
Especially with junior because
he's making serious bank.

4015
01:50:37,980 --> 01:50:39,310
Good shit going on right now.

4016
01:50:39,670 --> 01:50:40,240
Yeah.

4017
01:50:40,240 --> 01:50:41,073
Yeah.

4018
01:50:41,880 --> 01:50:44,240
Tr trying to get his guard pass,

4019
01:50:44,241 --> 01:50:45,640
but you just take,

4020
01:50:45,641 --> 01:50:45,771
that's,

4021
01:50:45,771 --> 01:50:47,770
it's just a battle of the
guard pass right here.

4022
01:50:49,590 --> 01:50:49,950
Okay.

4023
01:50:49,950 --> 01:50:50,341
Now Eddie,

4024
01:50:50,341 --> 01:50:53,850
when you know all the Goto Shit
from half guard that you know,

4025
01:50:54,060 --> 01:50:57,150
when you see dudes just kinda
hanging on in these positions,

4026
01:50:57,390 --> 01:50:58,800
when you see guys on the bottom,

4027
01:50:58,920 --> 01:51:03,090
does that frustrate you when you see
guys that don't attack or does it like,

4028
01:51:03,150 --> 01:51:05,340
does it like open you up to possibilities?

4029
01:51:05,341 --> 01:51:05,701
Like wait,

4030
01:51:05,701 --> 01:51:07,320
hey my students get in a situation,

4031
01:51:07,321 --> 01:51:08,310
you're gonna see some shit.

4032
01:51:08,610 --> 01:51:09,061
Like how do you,

4033
01:51:09,061 --> 01:51:11,520
like when you look at this
and you see like all these,

4034
01:51:11,700 --> 01:51:14,820
like if you look at what you
would be doing in this situation,

4035
01:51:14,970 --> 01:51:18,690
I would never have the balls to get
it in the cage and do any of this shit

4036
01:51:18,691 --> 01:51:19,030
first.

4037
01:51:19,030 --> 01:51:19,220
Well,

4038
01:51:19,220 --> 01:51:19,620
let me just,

4039
01:51:19,620 --> 01:51:20,600
that's very beautiful.

4040
01:51:20,601 --> 01:51:20,710
I've,

4041
01:51:20,710 --> 01:51:21,110
yeah,

4042
01:51:21,110 --> 01:51:22,040
but I mean when you say,

4043
01:51:22,070 --> 01:51:23,600
just from a technical aspect,

4044
01:51:23,630 --> 01:51:27,090
if you see guys on the
ground and they're there in,

4045
01:51:27,140 --> 01:51:30,260
in positions in the garden and
you see like sloppy guard work,

4046
01:51:30,380 --> 01:51:32,600
does that frustrate you or
does it make you think like,

4047
01:51:32,601 --> 01:51:32,871
hey,

4048
01:51:32,871 --> 01:51:33,141
you know,

4049
01:51:33,141 --> 01:51:33,381
look,

4050
01:51:33,381 --> 01:51:34,700
this is just great for,

4051
01:51:34,730 --> 01:51:34,971
you know,

4052
01:51:34,971 --> 01:51:35,330
my,

4053
01:51:35,330 --> 01:51:37,550
my fighters guys like Ben
Saunders that are trained.

4054
01:51:37,660 --> 01:51:38,050
Oh yeah.

4055
01:51:38,050 --> 01:51:38,320
They go,

4056
01:51:38,320 --> 01:51:39,890
oh shit and he'll magnet going off.

4057
01:51:39,980 --> 01:51:40,550
Yup.

4058
01:51:40,550 --> 01:51:40,821
He's like,

4059
01:51:40,821 --> 01:51:41,880
I don't like being on the bottom.

4060
01:51:42,160 --> 01:51:43,530
Does that fucking cardio?

4061
01:51:43,610 --> 01:51:44,271
Oh,

4062
01:51:44,271 --> 01:51:44,811
slipped,

4063
01:51:44,811 --> 01:51:45,644
slipped on a knee.

4064
01:51:46,130 --> 01:51:47,930
But still you're their
cardio Neil magnate.

4065
01:51:47,960 --> 01:51:48,460
Yeah.

4066
01:51:48,460 --> 01:51:48,850
Go,

4067
01:51:48,850 --> 01:51:49,110
go,

4068
01:51:49,110 --> 01:51:49,943
go.

4069
01:51:51,740 --> 01:51:53,160
If we just get a main street,

4070
01:51:53,360 --> 01:51:54,020
there's,

4071
01:51:54,020 --> 01:51:56,660
there's just so much to train when you're,

4072
01:51:56,720 --> 01:51:59,180
when you're fighting MMA and um,

4073
01:51:59,330 --> 01:52:00,290
it's a really,

4074
01:52:00,291 --> 01:52:04,940
really smart thing to do when you first
start getting into MMA to get your

4075
01:52:04,941 --> 01:52:05,900
striking together.

4076
01:52:05,901 --> 01:52:09,620
Cause it's the worst possible thing
that can happen is you get your fucking,

4077
01:52:09,890 --> 01:52:11,780
you get knocked the fuck out.

4078
01:52:11,810 --> 01:52:13,520
That's way worse than getting choked out.

4079
01:52:13,850 --> 01:52:14,570
Getting,

4080
01:52:14,570 --> 01:52:17,030
getting put in a rear naked
choke is kind of humiliating.

4081
01:52:17,180 --> 01:52:18,190
Especially if you're a striker.

4082
01:52:18,191 --> 01:52:18,890
It's like fuck,

4083
01:52:18,890 --> 01:52:23,120
but nothing's worse than getting
shut off and doing the fish.

4084
01:52:23,150 --> 01:52:23,631
That's the,

4085
01:52:23,631 --> 01:52:24,860
that's the worst nightmare.

4086
01:52:24,861 --> 01:52:29,861
So you have to spend so much time on
your feet to make sure that shit don't

4087
01:52:31,431 --> 01:52:35,060
happen because these guys are animals
that there's not that much time to really

4088
01:52:35,240 --> 01:52:38,450
do get the super technical
with your Jujitsu.

4089
01:52:38,750 --> 01:52:39,261
They're just,

4090
01:52:39,261 --> 01:52:40,280
there's not that much time.

4091
01:52:40,281 --> 01:52:41,150
So when I see,

4092
01:52:41,540 --> 01:52:42,373
uh,

4093
01:52:42,920 --> 01:52:46,160
just vanilla Jujitsu or
you want to call it from,

4094
01:52:46,340 --> 01:52:46,911
from fighters,

4095
01:52:46,911 --> 01:52:47,450
it's,

4096
01:52:47,450 --> 01:52:47,730
it's,

4097
01:52:47,730 --> 01:52:48,520
uh,

4098
01:52:48,520 --> 01:52:49,550
that's what I expect.

4099
01:52:49,551 --> 01:52:51,290
It's like they don't have the time.

4100
01:52:51,320 --> 01:52:52,400
I understand that they're,

4101
01:52:52,700 --> 01:52:55,610
they're spending most of their
time with their striking shit.

4102
01:52:56,240 --> 01:52:57,020
If I was,

4103
01:52:57,020 --> 01:52:59,750
if I had a gun to my head and something
someone said I have to do MMA,

4104
01:52:59,960 --> 01:53:04,870
I'd be spending my time striking
all day trying to avoid that.

4105
01:53:05,200 --> 01:53:06,320
The worst case scenario,

4106
01:53:06,321 --> 01:53:07,370
just getting shut off,

4107
01:53:07,371 --> 01:53:07,671
you know?

4108
01:53:07,671 --> 01:53:10,220
So there's just some emit
so many hours in the day.

4109
01:53:10,221 --> 01:53:11,450
You just can't train everything.

4110
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:12,833
You know?

4111
01:53:13,160 --> 01:53:14,690
Neil magni beaten this.

4112
01:53:16,750 --> 01:53:17,541
Oh Shit.

4113
01:53:17,541 --> 01:53:19,270
I think you broke that left.

4114
01:53:19,650 --> 01:53:20,930
I think he's breaking them in now.

4115
01:53:20,980 --> 01:53:21,290
Tuesday,

4116
01:53:21,290 --> 01:53:22,430
getting 20 seconds though.

4117
01:53:25,480 --> 01:53:26,090
No,

4118
01:53:26,090 --> 01:53:27,890
I guarantee you let them get to the round.

4119
01:53:28,710 --> 01:53:29,960
Herb's the best in the business.

4120
01:53:32,400 --> 01:53:33,530
I don't know.

4121
01:53:33,531 --> 01:53:34,770
I think you might've been able to lie.

4122
01:53:34,820 --> 01:53:37,310
He might've been at the doorway
there about 15 seconds ago.

4123
01:53:37,930 --> 01:53:38,940
We would have been a bad call.

4124
01:53:38,941 --> 01:53:39,500
Cause looking at me,

4125
01:53:39,500 --> 01:53:39,621
no,

4126
01:53:39,621 --> 01:53:42,060
but I'm saying if Neil could
have landed more shots,

4127
01:53:43,460 --> 01:53:45,350
that's a tough sport,

4128
01:53:45,351 --> 01:53:45,531
man.

4129
01:53:45,531 --> 01:53:46,310
I never,

4130
01:53:46,310 --> 01:53:46,701
ever,

4131
01:53:46,701 --> 01:53:50,990
ever had a dream to do and a
man just not like a barbarian.

4132
01:53:51,020 --> 01:53:51,710
I just,

4133
01:53:51,710 --> 01:53:56,360
I would've done it if my back
was against the wall if I had to.

4134
01:53:56,390 --> 01:54:00,080
Luckily I did some things in Jujitsu
where I didn't have to fight,

4135
01:54:00,380 --> 01:54:01,213
but uh,

4136
01:54:01,220 --> 01:54:04,400
if my back was against the wall
and I had to work at a regular job,

4137
01:54:04,401 --> 01:54:06,530
waking up at five 30
in the morning or MMA,

4138
01:54:06,740 --> 01:54:07,573
I would do them in a,

4139
01:54:07,670 --> 01:54:08,900
but I wouldn't be happy about it.

4140
01:54:09,310 --> 01:54:09,520
Um,

4141
01:54:09,520 --> 01:54:09,980
I'm just,

4142
01:54:09,980 --> 01:54:10,640
I'm just,

4143
01:54:10,640 --> 01:54:11,570
I'm not that guy.

4144
01:54:11,810 --> 01:54:14,960
I'm not that guy like Ben and Brendan,

4145
01:54:14,961 --> 01:54:16,730
you guys are fucking animals,

4146
01:54:16,731 --> 01:54:17,001
man.

4147
01:54:17,001 --> 01:54:20,750
To fucking want to do it and want the
big fights and want to do it in front of

4148
01:54:20,751 --> 01:54:21,584
the whole world.

4149
01:54:21,950 --> 01:54:25,490
I'm like 99.9999% of the population.

4150
01:54:25,850 --> 01:54:26,960
We don't have the balls.

4151
01:54:27,080 --> 01:54:28,640
There's only a tiny percentage of guys.

4152
01:54:28,880 --> 01:54:29,930
I'm not one of those guys.

4153
01:54:30,110 --> 01:54:30,980
I like Jujitsu.

4154
01:54:31,100 --> 01:54:32,990
It's as close as I'll get and uh,

4155
01:54:32,991 --> 01:54:33,950
if I had a gun to my head,

4156
01:54:33,951 --> 01:54:34,221
I would do,

4157
01:54:34,221 --> 01:54:34,611
I'm in my,

4158
01:54:34,611 --> 01:54:35,011
but I'm not,

4159
01:54:35,011 --> 01:54:36,010
I'm not a barbarian.

4160
01:54:36,020 --> 01:54:37,850
Jitsu is fucking nerve wracking too,

4161
01:54:37,851 --> 01:54:38,121
man.

4162
01:54:38,121 --> 01:54:42,140
When I did that Metamorris I really didn't
think my nerves would get to me like

4163
01:54:42,141 --> 01:54:42,760
a fight,

4164
01:54:42,760 --> 01:54:44,090
like shop,

4165
01:54:44,091 --> 01:54:44,361
you're up.

4166
01:54:44,361 --> 01:54:44,601
I was like,

4167
01:54:44,601 --> 01:54:45,620
Oh shit.

4168
01:54:45,680 --> 01:54:45,981
Yeah,

4169
01:54:45,981 --> 01:54:47,750
but that's an ego thing really.

4170
01:54:47,751 --> 01:54:51,410
That's just pure MMA is ego and physical.

4171
01:54:52,260 --> 01:54:54,260
It's nonphysical hand physical,

4172
01:54:54,320 --> 01:54:56,030
all manifested into one.

4173
01:54:56,210 --> 01:54:57,043
Boom.

4174
01:54:57,080 --> 01:55:00,620
That's why the glory is so beautiful
when you win that glory when you,

4175
01:55:00,710 --> 01:55:02,540
I've never knocked anybody out in the UFC,

4176
01:55:02,541 --> 01:55:02,940
but I see,

4177
01:55:02,940 --> 01:55:03,591
I see.

4178
01:55:03,591 --> 01:55:07,500
And I could feel it when chuck little
Dell knock someone out and he does that.

4179
01:55:08,780 --> 01:55:12,200
He knows right now the whole world is
watching and he's thinking about the after

4180
01:55:12,201 --> 01:55:13,130
party and all that shit.

4181
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:13,620
He's like,

4182
01:55:13,620 --> 01:55:15,790
ah man,

4183
01:55:15,800 --> 01:55:16,633
who's my man?

4184
01:55:21,710 --> 01:55:22,543
Exactly.

4185
01:55:22,610 --> 01:55:27,610
That's why the glory is so beautiful
because we're losing fuels the worst ever.

4186
01:55:27,711 --> 01:55:30,980
So most of that glory is the ultimate.

4187
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:31,260
I,

4188
01:55:31,260 --> 01:55:32,450
everybody wants that glory,

4189
01:55:32,720 --> 01:55:34,520
but the risk of going the other way.

4190
01:55:34,610 --> 01:55:35,210
Ooh,

4191
01:55:35,210 --> 01:55:36,043
too risky.

4192
01:55:36,050 --> 01:55:37,280
So most people don't have the balls.

4193
01:55:37,400 --> 01:55:38,061
You guys are like,

4194
01:55:38,061 --> 01:55:38,691
fuck a plan.

4195
01:55:38,691 --> 01:55:39,201
The lottery,

4196
01:55:39,201 --> 01:55:41,690
like we're going to fucking do
it and you're happy about it.

4197
01:55:41,691 --> 01:55:44,510
He can't wait to train
Ben Saunders fucking,

4198
01:55:45,150 --> 01:55:48,630
she loves every aspect of fighting.

4199
01:55:48,660 --> 01:55:49,330
I've sat down,

4200
01:55:49,330 --> 01:55:53,160
had many conversations with Ben
then this is one of the coolest.

4201
01:55:53,520 --> 01:55:58,520
He's got his fucking hold spirituality
together and I'm so impressed with Ben as

4202
01:55:59,581 --> 01:56:01,640
a person and handles all this tea.

4203
01:56:01,740 --> 01:56:02,101
Yeah,

4204
01:56:02,101 --> 01:56:02,790
man.

4205
01:56:02,790 --> 01:56:03,900
You know he's right there.

4206
01:56:04,160 --> 01:56:04,530
Yeah,

4207
01:56:04,530 --> 01:56:04,760
it's,

4208
01:56:04,760 --> 01:56:06,120
it's like retired when he's not here.

4209
01:56:07,620 --> 01:56:08,453
Please.

4210
01:56:08,990 --> 01:56:09,720
Yeah,

4211
01:56:09,720 --> 01:56:10,553
it's crazy

4212
01:56:15,270 --> 01:56:15,810
shit.

4213
01:56:15,810 --> 01:56:17,220
Now Neil's going to be really famous.

4214
01:56:17,221 --> 01:56:20,460
Now Watch if you can get a
little personality on the mic.

4215
01:56:20,480 --> 01:56:21,180
Yeah.

4216
01:56:21,180 --> 01:56:21,640
Damn.

4217
01:56:21,640 --> 01:56:22,360
You know.

4218
01:56:22,360 --> 01:56:23,270
Ah,

4219
01:56:24,410 --> 01:56:26,910
well some lessons awful.

4220
01:56:26,911 --> 01:56:28,020
Neil magnates tough.

4221
01:56:28,021 --> 01:56:28,920
Either you got it or you don't.

4222
01:56:28,921 --> 01:56:30,210
There's no lesson might hire you.

4223
01:56:30,211 --> 01:56:32,620
I said these guys cardios

4224
01:56:36,180 --> 01:56:36,811
ultimate fighters,

4225
01:56:36,811 --> 01:56:37,680
they got to go through you.

4226
01:56:37,850 --> 01:56:40,320
They got to take a three week course
of Brennan shock with a big ground

4227
01:56:40,340 --> 01:56:40,860
workshop.

4228
01:56:40,860 --> 01:56:41,671
What I was asking you,

4229
01:56:41,671 --> 01:56:43,530
I know how you feel about
him and man you fighting.

4230
01:56:43,531 --> 01:56:44,310
That's not what I meant.

4231
01:56:44,310 --> 01:56:47,370
What I meant was like when you see all
these openings on the ground being like

4232
01:56:47,371 --> 01:56:49,470
her guard specialist does it like,

4233
01:56:49,680 --> 01:56:50,250
do you go,

4234
01:56:50,250 --> 01:56:50,701
oh,

4235
01:56:50,701 --> 01:56:52,680
does it frustrate you that
people don't know this shit?

4236
01:56:52,710 --> 01:56:53,061
No,

4237
01:56:53,061 --> 01:56:53,490
this,

4238
01:56:53,490 --> 01:56:54,510
there's no frustration.

4239
01:56:54,990 --> 01:56:57,210
Does it give you a feeling of like,

4240
01:56:57,211 --> 01:56:57,511
look,

4241
01:56:57,511 --> 01:56:58,350
this is good.

4242
01:56:58,620 --> 01:57:03,240
My guys know how to do shit that other
guys aren't doing an MMA and the more MMA

4243
01:57:03,241 --> 01:57:05,490
fighters I coach with
the right techniques,

4244
01:57:05,610 --> 01:57:07,140
the more we're going to
see this kind of stuff.

4245
01:57:07,860 --> 01:57:08,220
Man,

4246
01:57:08,220 --> 01:57:09,053
I,

4247
01:57:09,870 --> 01:57:13,560
I dunno what to say to
that shitty technique.

4248
01:57:13,680 --> 01:57:14,161
You're not like,

4249
01:57:14,161 --> 01:57:14,994
come on son.

4250
01:57:17,310 --> 01:57:17,971
I don't know man.

4251
01:57:17,971 --> 01:57:19,110
I don't know what to say about that.

4252
01:57:19,111 --> 01:57:20,070
What did he say about that?

4253
01:57:20,071 --> 01:57:21,030
And he's too high right now.

4254
01:57:21,090 --> 01:57:21,960
It frustrates me.

4255
01:57:24,610 --> 01:57:26,700
I'm not frustrated.

4256
01:57:26,820 --> 01:57:28,530
I understand the situation.

4257
01:57:28,680 --> 01:57:29,610
I understand where the,

4258
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,310
what the mentality of a,

4259
01:57:32,700 --> 01:57:33,570
the whole thing.

4260
01:57:33,571 --> 01:57:33,721
You know,

4261
01:57:33,721 --> 01:57:33,990
I've,

4262
01:57:33,990 --> 01:57:38,400
I've been backstage and talk to so many
fighters in the UFC for so many years

4263
01:57:38,401 --> 01:57:39,091
and King of the case,

4264
01:57:39,091 --> 01:57:43,050
I've been in the business making money
for a long time backstage watching their

4265
01:57:43,051 --> 01:57:45,840
lives and the more I worked
backstage is the more,

4266
01:57:45,900 --> 01:57:46,201
to me,

4267
01:57:46,201 --> 01:57:46,650
I'm like,

4268
01:57:46,650 --> 01:57:48,630
that's too much pressure for me.

4269
01:57:49,980 --> 01:57:54,210
I see what these guys are going through
and all these guys go into not only the

4270
01:57:54,211 --> 01:57:57,750
fighters but like the apparel brands
and everyone's trying to start their own

4271
01:57:57,751 --> 01:57:58,620
apparel brand.

4272
01:57:58,830 --> 01:57:59,490
And I like I,

4273
01:57:59,490 --> 01:58:03,060
I remember back in 2001 rage athletic.

4274
01:58:05,560 --> 01:58:06,260
Yeah,

4275
01:58:06,260 --> 01:58:07,093
that shit.

4276
01:58:07,530 --> 01:58:08,580
I see these guys,

4277
01:58:08,640 --> 01:58:08,930
he,

4278
01:58:08,930 --> 01:58:09,210
they,

4279
01:58:09,210 --> 01:58:12,090
they put all their money because we're
going to do what MMA is getting big.

4280
01:58:12,091 --> 01:58:15,510
I got a clothing line and you
just see them come and go.

4281
01:58:15,511 --> 01:58:19,080
So after a while you see the UFC fighters
coming through and like the tough

4282
01:58:19,081 --> 01:58:21,330
fighters and doing it for so many years.

4283
01:58:21,331 --> 01:58:21,840
I'm like,

4284
01:58:21,840 --> 01:58:24,750
the odds that you're going to
be around in two years or so,

4285
01:58:24,751 --> 01:58:25,584
not good.

4286
01:58:25,620 --> 01:58:26,453
They're not good.

4287
01:58:27,090 --> 01:58:27,750
I like talking.

4288
01:58:27,750 --> 01:58:28,080
I'm like,

4289
01:58:28,080 --> 01:58:28,891
you're loving life.

4290
01:58:28,891 --> 01:58:30,640
I now enjoy that shit when

4291
01:58:32,280 --> 01:58:33,460
people weren't lasting.

4292
01:58:33,500 --> 01:58:33,750
Look,

4293
01:58:33,750 --> 01:58:35,280
you look at the UFC eight years ago,

4294
01:58:35,370 --> 01:58:35,881
you put on it,

4295
01:58:35,881 --> 01:58:36,630
you have to clean.

4296
01:58:36,630 --> 01:58:37,463
These fighters aren't,

4297
01:58:37,740 --> 01:58:40,260
it's so hard.

4298
01:58:40,261 --> 01:58:42,040
You know the average is a year and a half.

4299
01:58:42,070 --> 01:58:42,903
Exactly.

4300
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,400
Average career in the NFLs
three and a half years when you,

4301
01:58:45,401 --> 01:58:47,230
if you know this right away,

4302
01:58:47,231 --> 01:58:48,550
it's like a scared straight program.

4303
01:58:48,551 --> 01:58:51,430
All of these little kids that
want to be a fucking MMA fighters,

4304
01:58:51,490 --> 01:58:54,640
you put them through a scared straight
and you have him sit down and fucking,

4305
01:58:55,360 --> 01:58:56,470
I don't want to say any names,

4306
01:58:56,471 --> 01:58:59,680
but I mean there's guys that
are just fucking broken from it.

4307
01:58:59,681 --> 01:59:00,221
You know what I mean?

4308
01:59:00,221 --> 01:59:01,054
You say Joe,

4309
01:59:02,410 --> 01:59:03,243
we're going to say ted.

4310
01:59:03,450 --> 01:59:03,761
I don't know.

4311
01:59:03,761 --> 01:59:07,510
I think that's a life that's
a string of the guy going,

4312
01:59:07,780 --> 01:59:11,020
I want to make my living as a
fighter and I want to be like,

4313
01:59:11,110 --> 01:59:12,310
I'm looking at the lights and I go,

4314
01:59:12,340 --> 01:59:12,551
Ooh,

4315
01:59:12,551 --> 01:59:15,400
I want to be George Saint
Pierre or something as
opposed to dudes that are real

4316
01:59:15,401 --> 01:59:16,540
mother fuckers that are going,

4317
01:59:16,810 --> 01:59:18,040
I just liked this.

4318
01:59:18,190 --> 01:59:19,120
I like to do this.

4319
01:59:19,240 --> 01:59:20,073
Whether there was money,

4320
01:59:20,260 --> 01:59:21,780
whether there's money or not.

4321
01:59:21,850 --> 01:59:26,170
My heart needs this expression in this
venue and I want to feel that pressure

4322
01:59:26,171 --> 01:59:27,520
and see who I am under that.

4323
01:59:27,700 --> 01:59:29,340
Like that's a whole
different kind of time.

4324
01:59:29,341 --> 01:59:29,451
I,

4325
01:59:29,451 --> 01:59:30,284
one guy

4326
01:59:31,480 --> 01:59:34,390
I wanted to ask you was what
do you think about all this?

4327
01:59:34,391 --> 01:59:36,790
A class action lawsuit
stuff that's going on.

4328
01:59:37,480 --> 01:59:39,760
I couldn't believe that recently.

4329
01:59:39,761 --> 01:59:43,360
I couldn't believe that Mac Danzig
and gave Ruediger became a part of it.

4330
01:59:43,600 --> 01:59:46,080
There's a new class action
lawsuit goes back me up.

4331
01:59:46,410 --> 01:59:47,800
What's crazy?

4332
01:59:47,830 --> 01:59:48,251
What is,

4333
01:59:48,251 --> 01:59:48,880
what is it?

4334
01:59:48,880 --> 01:59:49,691
What does it mean?

4335
01:59:49,691 --> 01:59:50,680
Like what are they doing?

4336
01:59:50,840 --> 01:59:55,780
I'm not understanding what a guy who's
like a gay Ruediger like what could it be

4337
01:59:55,781 --> 01:59:56,411
suing for?

4338
01:59:56,411 --> 01:59:56,970
I'm not,

4339
01:59:56,970 --> 01:59:57,230
I've,

4340
01:59:57,230 --> 01:59:57,530
I've,

4341
01:59:57,530 --> 01:59:58,120
I honestly,

4342
01:59:58,120 --> 02:00:00,190
I don't know the details
and what they're suing for.

4343
02:00:00,340 --> 02:00:05,040
I just know that they want the
fighters to have more of a say and,

4344
02:00:05,160 --> 02:00:06,340
and get paid better.

4345
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:10,270
That's what the aim of class action
lawsuit and concussions and nothing.

4346
02:00:10,650 --> 02:00:11,170
Yeah.

4347
02:00:11,170 --> 02:00:11,321
So,

4348
02:00:11,321 --> 02:00:12,580
but what do they possibly,

4349
02:00:12,581 --> 02:00:13,390
what's the,

4350
02:00:13,390 --> 02:00:14,890
what are they saying in the cloud?

4351
02:00:14,920 --> 02:00:15,860
Did you know?

4352
02:00:15,861 --> 02:00:16,440
I don't know.

4353
02:00:16,440 --> 02:00:18,220
I like coming up to you several times.

4354
02:00:18,320 --> 02:00:19,153
Damn.

4355
02:00:19,520 --> 02:00:21,100
Not touching it.

4356
02:00:21,130 --> 02:00:22,120
Just for the record of course.

4357
02:00:22,980 --> 02:00:26,290
Well I feel like a very good
living messing with the UFC.

4358
02:00:26,440 --> 02:00:29,980
I feel like it's a bunch
of people that are like,

4359
02:00:29,981 --> 02:00:32,020
especially lawyers that are
getting involved in this,

4360
02:00:32,021 --> 02:00:33,790
they recognize that
there's blood in the water.

4361
02:00:34,040 --> 02:00:35,290
There was a guy that called me,

4362
02:00:36,930 --> 02:00:37,571
called me and goes,

4363
02:00:37,571 --> 02:00:39,130
do you know anybody that
wants to get involved in this?

4364
02:00:39,131 --> 02:00:41,350
And he's just some random
lawyer from fucking Texas.

4365
02:00:41,351 --> 02:00:42,850
That was like two weeks ago.

4366
02:00:42,880 --> 02:00:45,160
Do you think grosser and Grosser,

4367
02:00:45,190 --> 02:00:48,790
do you think a guy like Gabe Ruediger
or a guy like Mac Dansik who had Mac had

4368
02:00:48,791 --> 02:00:49,330
already,

4369
02:00:49,330 --> 02:00:50,320
even when I got a good career,

4370
02:00:50,321 --> 02:00:52,090
won the ultimate fighter and you know,

4371
02:00:52,091 --> 02:00:56,350
had decided he wasn't taking shots well
anymore and it brought a very eloquent

4372
02:00:56,351 --> 02:00:58,450
piece about it and I respect Mac a lot.

4373
02:00:58,480 --> 02:00:59,410
He's a very smart,

4374
02:00:59,411 --> 02:01:00,060
great dude.

4375
02:01:00,060 --> 02:01:01,660
When I see him that he's in it,

4376
02:01:01,780 --> 02:01:02,051
I go,

4377
02:01:02,051 --> 02:01:02,261
wow,

4378
02:01:02,261 --> 02:01:02,770
this is,

4379
02:01:02,770 --> 02:01:03,910
I wonder what this is.

4380
02:01:04,090 --> 02:01:05,200
And I wonder like,

4381
02:01:05,290 --> 02:01:07,510
I mean total speculation
I would have to ask,

4382
02:01:07,511 --> 02:01:09,730
but if some guys are like,

4383
02:01:09,750 --> 02:01:10,001
you know,

4384
02:01:10,001 --> 02:01:10,151
hey,

4385
02:01:10,151 --> 02:01:11,290
this is the end of my career.

4386
02:01:11,291 --> 02:01:14,050
I'm not fighting anymore so I don't
have to worry about pissing them off.

4387
02:01:14,210 --> 02:01:15,790
I don't want them to hire me again.

4388
02:01:15,820 --> 02:01:16,750
That's what do you think?

4389
02:01:16,751 --> 02:01:17,800
You can get me some money,

4390
02:01:18,280 --> 02:01:19,113
let's do it.

4391
02:01:19,630 --> 02:01:20,463
I think it's company,

4392
02:01:20,750 --> 02:01:24,940
he's combination is some dudes being like
the sport needs to change and it does.

4393
02:01:25,030 --> 02:01:25,870
Dana knows this.

4394
02:01:25,871 --> 02:01:27,040
Everyone in this room knows this.

4395
02:01:27,130 --> 02:01:28,420
Certain things have to change.

4396
02:01:28,660 --> 02:01:30,250
If the fighters had a union,

4397
02:01:30,251 --> 02:01:31,540
there's no reason we shouldn't.

4398
02:01:31,910 --> 02:01:33,150
There's no reason we shouldn't.

4399
02:01:33,190 --> 02:01:34,870
The UV under major leagues do.

4400
02:01:34,900 --> 02:01:35,200
Yeah.

4401
02:01:35,200 --> 02:01:37,090
The unions that exist in other sports,

4402
02:01:37,091 --> 02:01:39,470
they benefit the players for sure.

4403
02:01:39,770 --> 02:01:40,580
But it,

4404
02:01:40,580 --> 02:01:42,040
I think the,

4405
02:01:42,041 --> 02:01:45,240
the difference being that there's a bunch
of different teams like say if Seattle

4406
02:01:45,241 --> 02:01:47,210
doesn't want you anymore
and then Boston wants you,

4407
02:01:47,211 --> 02:01:48,390
there's like New England wants you,

4408
02:01:48,520 --> 02:01:52,220
you can travel around and be a part of
different teams and that's where most of

4409
02:01:52,221 --> 02:01:53,450
the negotiation takes place.

4410
02:01:53,720 --> 02:01:54,650
With the UFC.

4411
02:01:54,920 --> 02:01:57,270
The issue that people have
is that there's a new,

4412
02:01:57,320 --> 02:01:57,381
uh,

4413
02:01:57,381 --> 02:01:58,041
UFC,

4414
02:01:58,041 --> 02:01:58,910
there's no teams.

4415
02:01:58,940 --> 02:02:01,910
It's just like everybody's playing for
the same team because one fucking team

4416
02:02:01,911 --> 02:02:02,930
that team's the UFC,

4417
02:02:03,050 --> 02:02:07,040
it's not the NFL because the NFL comprised
is comprised of a bunch of different

4418
02:02:07,041 --> 02:02:07,760
businesses.

4419
02:02:07,760 --> 02:02:09,650
People own the Seattle Seahawks,

4420
02:02:09,651 --> 02:02:11,360
they own the Miami Dolphins,

4421
02:02:11,361 --> 02:02:12,560
they owned the Raiders,

4422
02:02:12,561 --> 02:02:14,030
but they're all under one branch.

4423
02:02:14,150 --> 02:02:18,260
You can do the NFL umbrella and
they're all under the NFL and umbrella.

4424
02:02:18,261 --> 02:02:20,630
And part of this union is when,

4425
02:02:20,631 --> 02:02:20,990
when,

4426
02:02:20,990 --> 02:02:23,060
so these just for then fl,

4427
02:02:23,390 --> 02:02:26,690
these NFL players are
destroying their bodies,

4428
02:02:26,691 --> 02:02:29,330
destroying the brains for
whatever the average Chris,

4429
02:02:29,331 --> 02:02:30,164
three and a half years.

4430
02:02:30,260 --> 02:02:32,450
So they're saying for those
three and a half years,

4431
02:02:32,480 --> 02:02:33,710
what we've given you,

4432
02:02:33,800 --> 02:02:35,720
we should be compensated
for down the road,

4433
02:02:35,810 --> 02:02:36,710
which is 100%.

4434
02:02:36,860 --> 02:02:37,101
Yeah,

4435
02:02:37,101 --> 02:02:37,491
there's,

4436
02:02:37,491 --> 02:02:39,320
there's without a doubt
there's some merit in that.

4437
02:02:39,350 --> 02:02:40,730
There's definitely some merit if,

4438
02:02:40,731 --> 02:02:41,060
uh,

4439
02:02:41,060 --> 02:02:42,770
if they were ignorant to the facts,

4440
02:02:42,920 --> 02:02:44,390
but now the facts had been exposed,

4441
02:02:44,420 --> 02:02:44,661
you know,

4442
02:02:44,661 --> 02:02:48,580
which is the claim about
concussions and NFL and him.

4443
02:02:48,581 --> 02:02:49,220
And I mean,

4444
02:02:49,220 --> 02:02:51,470
I think this goes with box
saying it goes to the MMA,

4445
02:02:51,660 --> 02:02:52,493
it goes to everything.

4446
02:02:52,670 --> 02:02:53,300
Once you,

4447
02:02:53,300 --> 02:02:56,570
once it's all out in a table and like
the medical facts and everything were in

4448
02:02:56,571 --> 02:02:57,610
order like you,

4449
02:02:57,620 --> 02:02:58,730
you've got to say,

4450
02:02:58,760 --> 02:02:59,480
okay,

4451
02:02:59,480 --> 02:03:01,430
you didn't know and they didn't know.

4452
02:03:01,431 --> 02:03:02,600
But now you do know.

4453
02:03:02,630 --> 02:03:03,021
Okay,

4454
02:03:03,021 --> 02:03:06,860
so now if you do know you have a certain
amount of responsibility to take care

4455
02:03:07,010 --> 02:03:08,780
of the people that are
under our protection.

4456
02:03:08,930 --> 02:03:12,260
So what does it entail to have CTE?

4457
02:03:12,380 --> 02:03:15,920
What are the issues that these
athletes can possibly be dealing with?

4458
02:03:16,070 --> 02:03:19,430
So you've got to mitigate whatever
the issues that come along with those,

4459
02:03:19,490 --> 02:03:20,750
those athletes being,

4460
02:03:20,950 --> 02:03:21,200
you know,

4461
02:03:21,200 --> 02:03:22,490
concussed on a regular basis.

4462
02:03:22,491 --> 02:03:23,390
You've got to mitigate that.

4463
02:03:23,570 --> 02:03:25,160
You've got to mitigate it by management.

4464
02:03:25,330 --> 02:03:27,470
You've got to mitigate it by counseling,

4465
02:03:27,471 --> 02:03:28,370
whether it's a,

4466
02:03:28,371 --> 02:03:28,701
you know,

4467
02:03:28,701 --> 02:03:30,560
having someone who's
a sports psychologist,

4468
02:03:30,680 --> 02:03:34,360
having someone who's a neurosurgeon
or a neuroscientist rather,

4469
02:03:34,390 --> 02:03:36,050
that can give them examinations,

4470
02:03:36,380 --> 02:03:37,280
cat scans,

4471
02:03:37,281 --> 02:03:38,114
all that jazz.

4472
02:03:38,210 --> 02:03:41,390
They should check you out on a
regular basis and that's great.

4473
02:03:41,690 --> 02:03:45,620
But those guys should also be compensated
down the road for risk in their life

4474
02:03:45,890 --> 02:03:47,000
being entertainers.

4475
02:03:47,060 --> 02:03:47,721
Certainly.

4476
02:03:47,721 --> 02:03:48,800
How about how we'll serve

4477
02:03:50,600 --> 02:03:51,680
peanuts for the rest of my life.

4478
02:03:51,681 --> 02:03:52,550
Peanuts up.

4479
02:03:52,700 --> 02:03:55,640
Then you start all that though.

4480
02:03:55,641 --> 02:03:56,510
But like what about,

4481
02:03:56,511 --> 02:03:57,170
what about that?

4482
02:03:57,170 --> 02:03:58,680
Any kid that goes into a,

4483
02:03:58,681 --> 02:04:01,880
into a football like you're playing,

4484
02:04:01,910 --> 02:04:04,290
you're playing football throughout,

4485
02:04:04,400 --> 02:04:05,233
uh,

4486
02:04:05,760 --> 02:04:09,380
throughout junior high school and high
school are those parents are subject to

4487
02:04:09,381 --> 02:04:12,410
child abuse then cause you're putting
your kid in a position where they're

4488
02:04:12,411 --> 02:04:13,260
hitting can cost study.

4489
02:04:14,150 --> 02:04:15,350
I think you got a good point,

4490
02:04:15,351 --> 02:04:15,561
man.

4491
02:04:15,561 --> 02:04:16,640
I think that's a real good point.

4492
02:04:16,770 --> 02:04:20,150
[inaudible] kids aren't dedicated
their lives to football.

4493
02:04:21,100 --> 02:04:22,880
They are not really.

4494
02:04:22,910 --> 02:04:23,900
Some of them are men.

4495
02:04:23,901 --> 02:04:24,800
Some of them are.

4496
02:04:24,890 --> 02:04:25,730
Some of them are.

4497
02:04:25,731 --> 02:04:26,211
I mean there's,

4498
02:04:26,211 --> 02:04:26,450
there's,

4499
02:04:26,450 --> 02:04:27,283
there's some kids,

4500
02:04:27,470 --> 02:04:29,600
it's the Willy Wonka golden ticket.

4501
02:04:29,840 --> 02:04:30,980
Their parents realize it.

4502
02:04:31,100 --> 02:04:33,410
You've got a big kid
like say Brennan Shop.

4503
02:04:33,411 --> 02:04:35,120
I know you're happily a involved,

4504
02:04:35,121 --> 02:04:38,100
but what if some big Serena
Williams bitch would just

4505
02:04:38,100 --> 02:04:38,900
like the perfect boot?

4506
02:04:38,900 --> 02:04:39,120
I don't,

4507
02:04:39,120 --> 02:04:40,560
may I say bitch with all due respect,

4508
02:04:40,620 --> 02:04:41,040
of course.

4509
02:04:41,040 --> 02:04:43,770
It's a beautiful super athlete
is what I'm trying to say.

4510
02:04:43,920 --> 02:04:46,650
If someone enormous
fucking volleyball player,

4511
02:04:46,651 --> 02:04:47,700
like was that chick's name?

4512
02:04:47,930 --> 02:04:49,050
The Gabrielle Reece.

4513
02:04:49,140 --> 02:04:49,500
Okay.

4514
02:04:49,500 --> 02:04:50,610
If she wants to slang some,

4515
02:04:50,790 --> 02:04:51,360
some,

4516
02:04:51,360 --> 02:04:52,021
some eggs.

4517
02:04:52,021 --> 02:04:54,930
Your way fucking savages in babies.

4518
02:04:54,990 --> 02:04:58,620
And then you realize maybe
you're a dude who like,

4519
02:04:58,621 --> 02:04:59,041
you know,

4520
02:04:59,041 --> 02:05:00,780
you always wanted a coach.

4521
02:05:01,050 --> 02:05:03,600
You know you always wanted to
coach a little guy from the jump.

4522
02:05:03,750 --> 02:05:07,820
So you'd get this little
motherfucker [inaudible] you're like,

4523
02:05:07,890 --> 02:05:08,221
listen,

4524
02:05:08,221 --> 02:05:09,001
you little mother fucker,

4525
02:05:09,001 --> 02:05:10,800
you got some tailored jeans,

4526
02:05:10,950 --> 02:05:15,210
some savaging we're gonna make some
money and your kids like Daddy,

4527
02:05:15,211 --> 02:05:16,560
but I want to paint flowers.

4528
02:05:16,590 --> 02:05:17,880
I wish I was born a girl.

4529
02:05:17,910 --> 02:05:18,743
No Bitch.

4530
02:05:18,780 --> 02:05:19,613
Get the football.

4531
02:05:20,420 --> 02:05:22,560
The football are hot.

4532
02:05:22,710 --> 02:05:23,543
You could beat him up.

4533
02:05:23,550 --> 02:05:26,400
Hey Max Holloway and our boy
Cole Miller ready to go at it.

4534
02:05:26,430 --> 02:05:27,030
Oh Shit.

4535
02:05:27,030 --> 02:05:27,661
Hey Cole Miller.

4536
02:05:27,661 --> 02:05:28,261
Some respect.

4537
02:05:28,261 --> 02:05:29,094
I love that dude.

4538
02:05:29,340 --> 02:05:30,173
Fuck.

4539
02:05:32,100 --> 02:05:33,090
He's a savage.

4540
02:05:33,230 --> 02:05:33,480
He's,

4541
02:05:33,480 --> 02:05:34,500
he's a good dude.

4542
02:05:34,710 --> 02:05:35,850
It's fun guy to hang with.

4543
02:05:36,630 --> 02:05:39,660
He's always down to throw
down and maximum command.

4544
02:05:40,570 --> 02:05:41,520
He's a bad motherfucker.

4545
02:05:41,950 --> 02:05:42,783
Number goes back.

4546
02:05:43,130 --> 02:05:45,430
[inaudible] going to be the difference.

4547
02:05:45,620 --> 02:05:46,560
This can get off.

4548
02:05:46,590 --> 02:05:47,370
He's going to win.

4549
02:05:47,370 --> 02:05:47,760
Max.

4550
02:05:47,760 --> 02:05:48,180
Take it.

4551
02:05:48,180 --> 02:05:48,301
No,

4552
02:05:48,301 --> 02:05:49,620
I'm not fucking Cole Miller struck.

4553
02:05:49,630 --> 02:05:50,431
He's pretty God damn good.

4554
02:05:50,431 --> 02:05:52,170
He knocked out Ross
piercer with a left hook.

4555
02:05:52,320 --> 02:05:53,020
This is true.

4556
02:05:53,020 --> 02:05:53,853
That's a good client.

4557
02:05:54,390 --> 02:05:57,810
He's a very good by Ross
Pearson is a fucking pea.

4558
02:05:57,870 --> 02:05:59,540
Cole Miller Shit too on the ground.

4559
02:05:59,541 --> 02:06:03,000
Coal Miller's whole family
is down to struggle.

4560
02:06:03,930 --> 02:06:08,910
Zad still fights his dad's
Miami still shit MMA.

4561
02:06:08,940 --> 02:06:09,773
I sounded like

4562
02:06:10,950 --> 02:06:13,110
his dad is cool as fuck too.

4563
02:06:13,111 --> 02:06:13,801
And then his brother,

4564
02:06:13,801 --> 02:06:14,634
brother,

4565
02:06:14,790 --> 02:06:15,780
brother Mike is close.

4566
02:06:15,800 --> 02:06:16,440
Father.

4567
02:06:16,440 --> 02:06:17,110
I'll fight.

4568
02:06:17,110 --> 02:06:17,970
Damn coolest.

4569
02:06:17,971 --> 02:06:18,780
Fuck yeah.

4570
02:06:18,780 --> 02:06:19,291
All of them.

4571
02:06:19,291 --> 02:06:20,124
Cool as fuck.

4572
02:06:20,370 --> 02:06:22,950
They're brain trauma.

4573
02:06:23,030 --> 02:06:25,050
Oh they're all game is.

4574
02:06:25,051 --> 02:06:25,680
Fuck man.

4575
02:06:25,680 --> 02:06:26,640
They're ready to throw.

4576
02:06:26,710 --> 02:06:26,980
Yeah.

4577
02:06:26,980 --> 02:06:27,920
There's just like,

4578
02:06:28,260 --> 02:06:29,470
you don't want to fucking uh,

4579
02:06:29,500 --> 02:06:30,210
uh,

4580
02:06:30,210 --> 02:06:31,440
burglarize their house.

4581
02:06:32,240 --> 02:06:33,051
Your boy deals.

4582
02:06:33,051 --> 02:06:33,884
What do you tell him?

4583
02:06:34,020 --> 02:06:34,920
See Him fight more.

4584
02:06:35,040 --> 02:06:35,491
No,

4585
02:06:35,491 --> 02:06:35,970
Nick.

4586
02:06:35,970 --> 02:06:36,271
Nick.

4587
02:06:36,271 --> 02:06:39,210
Well I think nick is going to
take a well deserved vacation now.

4588
02:06:39,211 --> 02:06:40,800
I hope they don't take
any money away from him.

4589
02:06:40,801 --> 02:06:42,330
I don't know what happens
with the weed thing.

4590
02:06:42,331 --> 02:06:42,900
I hope.

4591
02:06:42,900 --> 02:06:44,330
I hope it's a small fine.

4592
02:06:44,490 --> 02:06:46,320
He only fights once
every two years anyway.

4593
02:06:46,350 --> 02:06:47,400
Well it's not big deal.

4594
02:06:47,460 --> 02:06:48,840
I hope it's no big deal.

4595
02:06:48,841 --> 02:06:49,830
Cause I think it's stupid.

4596
02:06:49,831 --> 02:06:51,540
Unless he's fighting,

4597
02:06:51,570 --> 02:06:52,403
it's his third.

4598
02:06:53,340 --> 02:06:54,750
It's a stupid law.

4599
02:06:55,350 --> 02:06:56,200
Unless he's fine.

4600
02:06:56,250 --> 02:06:56,500
I'm,

4601
02:06:56,500 --> 02:06:56,780
I'm,

4602
02:06:56,780 --> 02:06:59,240
I'm my concern always with,

4603
02:06:59,241 --> 02:06:59,530
uh,

4604
02:06:59,530 --> 02:07:00,720
with these kinds of things.

4605
02:07:00,721 --> 02:07:02,970
It's like what are they doing
that's helping them fight?

4606
02:07:03,220 --> 02:07:03,600
It could,

4607
02:07:03,600 --> 02:07:07,770
could there be an argument that the
smoking weed helps his Jujitsu and that it

4608
02:07:07,771 --> 02:07:09,930
helps us training and helps
us cardio when he trains.

4609
02:07:09,990 --> 02:07:10,201
Yeah.

4610
02:07:10,201 --> 02:07:11,034
There can be an argument.

4611
02:07:11,050 --> 02:07:11,770
Yesterday is,

4612
02:07:11,770 --> 02:07:16,770
there was a recent argument about a
ultra marathoners ultra marathoners were

4613
02:07:17,250 --> 02:07:19,260
there were just talk
about how they're able to,

4614
02:07:19,261 --> 02:07:19,650
uh,

4615
02:07:19,650 --> 02:07:22,770
they run ultra marathons way
easier when they get high.

4616
02:07:22,780 --> 02:07:22,831
Yeah.

4617
02:07:22,831 --> 02:07:24,060
They run in a straight line.

4618
02:07:24,090 --> 02:07:24,451
No,

4619
02:07:24,451 --> 02:07:26,010
these guys are running over hills.

4620
02:07:26,011 --> 02:07:28,140
They do have other still running
straight but go that way.

4621
02:07:28,230 --> 02:07:28,741
But it is,

4622
02:07:28,741 --> 02:07:29,060
fuck,

4623
02:07:29,060 --> 02:07:29,270
it's,

4624
02:07:29,270 --> 02:07:30,510
it's hard man.

4625
02:07:30,690 --> 02:07:31,120
It's the,

4626
02:07:31,120 --> 02:07:32,510
what's happening with the,

4627
02:07:32,600 --> 02:07:37,600
the marijuana is it reduces inflammation
and it allows you to numb the pain.

4628
02:07:37,871 --> 02:07:39,100
Like you're not thinking about it.

4629
02:07:39,190 --> 02:07:42,070
You Ain't going to fuck your
ceiling yet knocked out.

4630
02:07:42,100 --> 02:07:42,450
You might need,

4631
02:07:42,450 --> 02:07:42,580
yeah,

4632
02:07:42,580 --> 02:07:42,751
yeah,

4633
02:07:42,751 --> 02:07:42,931
yeah,

4634
02:07:42,931 --> 02:07:43,570
yeah,

4635
02:07:43,570 --> 02:07:43,930
yeah.

4636
02:07:43,930 --> 02:07:44,141
No,

4637
02:07:44,141 --> 02:07:47,900
I don't say it's my stops performance
enhancing it is for Jujitsu.

4638
02:07:48,660 --> 02:07:49,500
Unless again,

4639
02:07:49,570 --> 02:07:50,590
unless it's bullshit,

4640
02:07:50,860 --> 02:07:55,690
it has been written that marijuana
actually opens lung passageways actually

4641
02:07:55,750 --> 02:07:56,590
opens your lungs.

4642
02:07:56,650 --> 02:07:57,170
What are you standing?

4643
02:07:57,170 --> 02:07:57,561
How fast?

4644
02:07:57,561 --> 02:07:58,270
But Jamie,

4645
02:07:58,270 --> 02:07:59,320
but that's what they're saying.

4646
02:07:59,530 --> 02:08:00,880
They're saying that that's what happens.

4647
02:08:00,940 --> 02:08:01,440
Hold on a second.

4648
02:08:01,440 --> 02:08:03,910
What basketball performance enhancing.

4649
02:08:04,290 --> 02:08:05,230
They test for it.

4650
02:08:06,100 --> 02:08:07,060
They don't test for it,

4651
02:08:07,090 --> 02:08:09,310
but you know it's almost
enhancing when people do it.

4652
02:08:11,920 --> 02:08:12,700
Yeah,

4653
02:08:12,700 --> 02:08:15,040
no it does makes it fit.

4654
02:08:15,041 --> 02:08:15,281
Look,

4655
02:08:15,281 --> 02:08:16,380
I'll tell you what it works with,

4656
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:17,831
but that whole thing,

4657
02:08:17,831 --> 02:08:18,311
that time,

4658
02:08:18,311 --> 02:08:19,144
dilation,

4659
02:08:19,190 --> 02:08:20,280
real concentration,

4660
02:08:20,680 --> 02:08:22,450
all that stuff about being into the zone.

4661
02:08:23,980 --> 02:08:27,880
There's a lot of studies that you
guys can't talk over each other.

4662
02:08:28,030 --> 02:08:30,640
There's this book called the rise of
Superman that they went into all these

4663
02:08:30,641 --> 02:08:31,630
studies about the zone,

4664
02:08:31,631 --> 02:08:35,650
about being in that flow and about time
dilation and we'd like cannabis does

4665
02:08:35,651 --> 02:08:36,520
that for people.

4666
02:08:36,650 --> 02:08:38,500
It gets you into that state quicker.

4667
02:08:38,501 --> 02:08:41,380
Where do you become a
heightened more alert animal?

4668
02:08:41,770 --> 02:08:42,101
Yeah,

4669
02:08:42,101 --> 02:08:43,150
it can for some people,

4670
02:08:43,151 --> 02:08:44,350
like Nick Diaz loves it,

4671
02:08:44,500 --> 02:08:46,550
so I bet if you let nick Diaz smoke weed,

4672
02:08:46,551 --> 02:08:47,800
he probably fight better on weight,

4673
02:08:48,220 --> 02:08:48,700
you know,

4674
02:08:48,700 --> 02:08:50,290
and it helps your cardio,

4675
02:08:50,291 --> 02:08:50,531
man.

4676
02:08:50,531 --> 02:08:51,191
It just does.

4677
02:08:51,191 --> 02:08:52,390
Like people don't want to admit that,

4678
02:08:52,570 --> 02:08:55,240
but marathon waters
report that the report,

4679
02:08:55,241 --> 02:08:57,880
it makes it easier for
them to go hard longer.

4680
02:08:57,940 --> 02:08:58,700
Okay.

4681
02:08:58,700 --> 02:08:59,170
All right.

4682
02:08:59,170 --> 02:09:00,610
Let's say it does all this shit.

4683
02:09:00,820 --> 02:09:01,930
Either way.

4684
02:09:01,931 --> 02:09:04,890
Anderson Silva was on some anabolic,

4685
02:09:05,270 --> 02:09:06,070
right?

4686
02:09:06,070 --> 02:09:06,903
That's illegal.

4687
02:09:06,970 --> 02:09:10,140
We know for a fact that helps for that.

4688
02:09:10,180 --> 02:09:11,380
Now there's no argument there.

4689
02:09:11,560 --> 02:09:12,400
There's no argument there.

4690
02:09:12,520 --> 02:09:13,450
The real question is,

4691
02:09:13,930 --> 02:09:16,120
is it helping nick during his training?

4692
02:09:16,330 --> 02:09:17,890
Like is it a performance enhancer?

4693
02:09:17,891 --> 02:09:20,950
Does it allow him to train
and a better way in some,

4694
02:09:21,220 --> 02:09:22,270
but you know what?

4695
02:09:22,450 --> 02:09:23,231
Guess what though?

4696
02:09:23,231 --> 02:09:23,730
Dude,

4697
02:09:23,730 --> 02:09:25,210
so does a lot of shit that people do.

4698
02:09:25,211 --> 02:09:27,280
So does this Goddamn
cryotherapy that we do,

4699
02:09:27,460 --> 02:09:29,410
they're cryotherapy
allows people to recover.

4700
02:09:29,420 --> 02:09:31,410
So does creotine oil.

4701
02:09:31,440 --> 02:09:33,350
It's like there's a lot
of shit that bothers me.

4702
02:09:34,070 --> 02:09:34,930
Make wheat elite.

4703
02:09:34,960 --> 02:09:36,220
How bad caffeine,

4704
02:09:37,030 --> 02:09:37,730
caffeine,

4705
02:09:37,730 --> 02:09:38,530
Halo loud.

4706
02:09:38,530 --> 02:09:39,640
I got a question for you,

4707
02:09:40,120 --> 02:09:40,630
Ben,

4708
02:09:40,630 --> 02:09:41,463
as well.

4709
02:09:41,500 --> 02:09:45,250
If they decided to just legalize steroids,

4710
02:09:45,550 --> 02:09:46,180
everyone,

4711
02:09:46,180 --> 02:09:47,013
steroids,

4712
02:09:47,020 --> 02:09:49,060
would we see fighters,

4713
02:09:49,430 --> 02:09:49,780
uh,

4714
02:09:49,780 --> 02:09:52,490
jumping up in weight or
staying right on the father?

4715
02:09:52,490 --> 02:09:56,950
Act like fucking Alster Overeem
is serious cells in 12 right now.

4716
02:09:56,951 --> 02:09:59,710
Seriously fucking legal.

4717
02:09:59,711 --> 02:10:00,544
You would

4718
02:10:02,250 --> 02:10:03,520
probably get bigger.

4719
02:10:03,850 --> 02:10:04,683
You'd want to get bigger?

4720
02:10:04,930 --> 02:10:05,441
Uh,

4721
02:10:05,441 --> 02:10:05,831
I don't know.

4722
02:10:05,831 --> 02:10:06,410
What other,

4723
02:10:06,410 --> 02:10:07,061
what'd you get bigger?

4724
02:10:07,061 --> 02:10:07,601
If it was legal,

4725
02:10:07,601 --> 02:10:08,434
would you use it?

4726
02:10:09,030 --> 02:10:09,790
I don't know.

4727
02:10:09,790 --> 02:10:13,750
They said we're going to legalize it
because he could go away at that point I'd

4728
02:10:13,751 --> 02:10:14,740
say show me the money.

4729
02:10:15,130 --> 02:10:15,401
Okay.

4730
02:10:15,401 --> 02:10:16,221
If I've got to go up,

4731
02:10:16,221 --> 02:10:17,500
they get the money and it's legal.

4732
02:10:17,650 --> 02:10:18,191
Exactly.

4733
02:10:18,191 --> 02:10:20,620
So most people would just stay the same,

4734
02:10:20,770 --> 02:10:21,603
right?

4735
02:10:21,640 --> 02:10:21,791
Yeah.

4736
02:10:21,791 --> 02:10:22,960
But you're talking to heavyweight.

4737
02:10:22,961 --> 02:10:27,961
I would look like then step up on
that micro quince for you though,

4738
02:10:28,390 --> 02:10:31,420
it wouldn't really be effective
to add more muscle mass.

4739
02:10:31,540 --> 02:10:34,730
You're optimized physically for frame
at one seven eight do you agree?

4740
02:10:35,120 --> 02:10:35,930
I would say so.

4741
02:10:35,930 --> 02:10:40,520
So if you were going to go to one 85
like a few like say you want to do it,

4742
02:10:40,521 --> 02:10:41,570
but if you wanted to do it,

4743
02:10:41,571 --> 02:10:44,780
if you looked at it like super
objectively with no desperation at all,

4744
02:10:44,920 --> 02:10:45,141
they're like,

4745
02:10:45,141 --> 02:10:46,160
what's the most,

4746
02:10:46,700 --> 02:10:49,610
what's the most intelligent
way to plan that out?

4747
02:10:49,730 --> 02:10:53,840
How long do you think you would take to
put on that kind of mass and keep and be

4748
02:10:53,841 --> 02:10:55,570
comfortable to go to heavyweight?

4749
02:10:55,600 --> 02:10:55,750
Yeah.

4750
02:10:55,750 --> 02:10:55,910
No,

4751
02:10:55,910 --> 02:10:56,110
no.

4752
02:10:56,110 --> 02:10:56,741
One 85.

4753
02:10:56,741 --> 02:10:56,990
He's like,

4754
02:10:56,990 --> 02:10:59,900
if you're going to go to one 85 and
you really decided I'm going to be a

4755
02:10:59,901 --> 02:11:02,990
middleweight fighter now I'm going to
abandon this idea of cutting weight and

4756
02:11:02,991 --> 02:11:06,410
staying lean and restricting my
calories and dehydrated myself.

4757
02:11:06,680 --> 02:11:08,000
How big would you want to get?

4758
02:11:08,560 --> 02:11:09,393
Ah,

4759
02:11:09,660 --> 02:11:13,810
I mean I'd roughly just tried to do
the same thing I'm doing for one 70.

4760
02:11:13,811 --> 02:11:17,290
Just obviously we're dealing
with 15 pounds heavier,

4761
02:11:17,590 --> 02:11:17,831
so,

4762
02:11:17,831 --> 02:11:18,591
but what would you do,

4763
02:11:18,591 --> 02:11:18,731
do,

4764
02:11:18,731 --> 02:11:20,170
would you give yourself a year?

4765
02:11:20,171 --> 02:11:20,531
Like two,

4766
02:11:20,531 --> 02:11:21,130
like if someone,

4767
02:11:21,130 --> 02:11:21,963
uh,

4768
02:11:22,450 --> 02:11:23,640
how much time can I start?

4769
02:11:23,641 --> 02:11:25,240
I my first four fights where,

4770
02:11:25,241 --> 02:11:27,130
what w one 81 85.

4771
02:11:27,131 --> 02:11:30,130
But I was stepping on
the scale with my jeans,

4772
02:11:30,780 --> 02:11:31,570
right?

4773
02:11:31,570 --> 02:11:32,403
Like lower level.

4774
02:11:34,170 --> 02:11:34,450
I mean,

4775
02:11:34,450 --> 02:11:37,230
like four fights you're saying if I
was in the UFC and items like that,

4776
02:11:38,530 --> 02:11:39,160
I mean,

4777
02:11:39,160 --> 02:11:39,521
honestly,

4778
02:11:39,521 --> 02:11:42,880
I don't know the science behind my body
type and how long it would take me to

4779
02:11:43,030 --> 02:11:44,230
produce that much,

4780
02:11:44,260 --> 02:11:45,130
uh,

4781
02:11:45,310 --> 02:11:46,143
additional muscles.

4782
02:11:46,210 --> 02:11:47,860
But it's something that you
would have to really consider,

4783
02:11:47,861 --> 02:11:48,694
right?

4784
02:11:49,300 --> 02:11:49,631
Yeah.

4785
02:11:49,631 --> 02:11:52,150
Like if I was going up to one 85
I don't know if I was going up,

4786
02:11:53,410 --> 02:11:54,550
but you wouldn't even do it.

4787
02:11:54,890 --> 02:11:55,150
No,

4788
02:11:55,150 --> 02:11:55,361
no,

4789
02:11:55,361 --> 02:11:55,520
no,

4790
02:11:55,520 --> 02:11:56,353
no.

4791
02:11:56,860 --> 02:11:57,161
The same.

4792
02:11:57,161 --> 02:11:57,994
Right.

4793
02:11:58,000 --> 02:11:58,151
Well,

4794
02:11:58,151 --> 02:12:02,980
the reason why I was asking was one
reason is because Henderson's tonight just

4795
02:12:02,981 --> 02:12:05,380
fought at one 55 like a month ago,

4796
02:12:05,860 --> 02:12:10,860
and now he's stepping in here tonight
and he's fighting fache who is a giant

4797
02:12:10,901 --> 02:12:11,830
fucking welterweight,

4798
02:12:11,890 --> 02:12:12,540
walked around that.

4799
02:12:12,540 --> 02:12:12,881
He'll be,

4800
02:12:12,881 --> 02:12:14,320
he'll be one 90 in the cage.

4801
02:12:14,350 --> 02:12:15,190
He's a big boy.

4802
02:12:15,390 --> 02:12:20,390
[inaudible] he's long lean
and he's super aggressive.

4803
02:12:20,440 --> 02:12:21,273
Great strikers.

4804
02:12:23,330 --> 02:12:24,163
No,

4805
02:12:24,360 --> 02:12:28,540
one 70 that's what he was when he
was cutting a 55 but since then,

4806
02:12:28,620 --> 02:12:29,730
I bet he probably can't.

4807
02:12:29,740 --> 02:12:30,640
It's only a month ago.

4808
02:12:31,140 --> 02:12:32,800
I bet against gain five pounds.

4809
02:12:32,801 --> 02:12:33,611
So maybe he's like,

4810
02:12:33,611 --> 02:12:34,060
well,

4811
02:12:34,060 --> 02:12:34,571
who knows,

4812
02:12:34,571 --> 02:12:34,780
man,

4813
02:12:34,780 --> 02:12:37,660
maybe it would be better at one
70 where he's not dehydrated them.

4814
02:12:37,661 --> 02:12:40,930
So maybe you'd be like a rumble Johnson
types of Jewish don't don't you think

4815
02:12:40,931 --> 02:12:45,931
like steroids and p Dee's benefit really
wanting 85 and above because those

4816
02:12:46,511 --> 02:12:49,050
bladder guys really then
maybe they're using EPO,

4817
02:12:49,090 --> 02:12:49,750
who knows,

4818
02:12:49,750 --> 02:12:52,510
but they're really not going to use the
antibiotics cause they can't put on them

4819
02:12:52,720 --> 02:12:56,890
maybe more prevalent at
the higher weight class.

4820
02:12:56,940 --> 02:12:58,540
It would help for
recovery during training,

4821
02:12:59,550 --> 02:13:04,550
but they got to cut weight for a little
bit for recovery growth and a little

4822
02:13:05,171 --> 02:13:08,920
test all the time to stay recovered and
do two a days all the way through and

4823
02:13:08,921 --> 02:13:11,800
not suffer overtraining as
much and then get clean.

4824
02:13:12,180 --> 02:13:13,500
You ain't going to get
in that much like that.

4825
02:13:13,501 --> 02:13:14,500
That Belko dude man,

4826
02:13:14,501 --> 02:13:15,670
he was interesting as fuck.

4827
02:13:15,700 --> 02:13:16,510
Yeah.

4828
02:13:16,510 --> 02:13:17,740
He's a fascinating guy.

4829
02:13:17,741 --> 02:13:18,491
And you know what man,

4830
02:13:18,491 --> 02:13:22,000
one of the things he's been saying over
and over again is that these testing

4831
02:13:22,001 --> 02:13:25,480
techniques are ineffective and
that these urine tests are given.

4832
02:13:25,510 --> 02:13:26,380
Fighters are just,

4833
02:13:26,610 --> 02:13:26,911
you know,

4834
02:13:26,911 --> 02:13:28,450
and everybody was calling bullshit on him.

4835
02:13:28,630 --> 02:13:29,530
He was saying they were just,

4836
02:13:29,950 --> 02:13:31,420
these are just intelligent test.

4837
02:13:31,440 --> 02:13:31,730
Yeah.

4838
02:13:31,730 --> 02:13:32,160
Yeah.

4839
02:13:32,160 --> 02:13:32,791
What's his name?

4840
02:13:32,791 --> 02:13:33,820
What's Bunko cat's name?

4841
02:13:33,821 --> 02:13:34,654
Victor contents.

4842
02:13:35,070 --> 02:13:36,320
But I had them on the podcast,

4843
02:13:36,321 --> 02:13:37,154
the interesting cat,

4844
02:13:37,320 --> 02:13:41,220
but after it's all over Maine now
he looks vindicated in my opinion.

4845
02:13:41,400 --> 02:13:41,701
I mean,

4846
02:13:41,701 --> 02:13:42,450
he's vindicated.

4847
02:13:42,450 --> 02:13:43,283
God Damn.

4848
02:13:43,580 --> 02:13:44,730
What were they dogging him about?

4849
02:13:44,760 --> 02:13:47,810
I apologize to everybody going to say
that John Fitch would never piss off.

4850
02:13:48,950 --> 02:13:49,411
I said,

4851
02:13:49,411 --> 02:13:54,240
Bj Penn and John Fitch oils guys will
ever piss hot and when John Fish Piss hot,

4852
02:13:54,330 --> 02:13:57,510
I found out that Santa
Claus wasn't real a really,

4853
02:13:59,900 --> 02:14:01,270
have you seen him in this last one is?

4854
02:14:01,860 --> 02:14:03,240
That's the first thing I noticed was like,

4855
02:14:03,241 --> 02:14:04,830
that doesn't look like regular John Fitch.

4856
02:14:05,220 --> 02:14:10,220
John Fitch has some big biceps with
giant water hose vein coming through.

4857
02:14:12,260 --> 02:14:12,740
He's getting,

4858
02:14:12,740 --> 02:14:13,500
he's,

4859
02:14:13,500 --> 02:14:14,550
I still didn't believe it.

4860
02:14:14,610 --> 02:14:15,540
He's huge.

4861
02:14:15,660 --> 02:14:17,280
Do you think it's possible that it wasn't?

4862
02:14:17,281 --> 02:14:17,760
That's all.

4863
02:14:17,760 --> 02:14:18,151
Is there,

4864
02:14:18,151 --> 02:14:21,780
is it possible that when guys
say that I need another test?

4865
02:14:22,090 --> 02:14:24,970
[inaudible]

4866
02:14:25,110 --> 02:14:25,943
the same shit.

4867
02:14:26,490 --> 02:14:26,881
Well,

4868
02:14:26,881 --> 02:14:27,870
Anderson Silva's train.

4869
02:14:27,871 --> 02:14:29,730
Have you ever seen the picture
of Anderson Silva's trainer?

4870
02:14:29,940 --> 02:14:31,790
Jeff [inaudible]?

4871
02:14:32,670 --> 02:14:36,790
He's 60 and that's like the hall
really close to him and he's a Strayer.

4872
02:14:36,830 --> 02:14:38,220
Guys always around that are saying,

4873
02:14:38,280 --> 02:14:39,690
don't do it as a good dude.

4874
02:14:39,691 --> 02:14:41,560
I like that guy just
ate that guy's sandwich.

4875
02:14:45,780 --> 02:14:48,690
We shared a lunch one time and
he got my head and I pissed.

4876
02:14:48,730 --> 02:14:53,360
[inaudible] gave him a
back rub with hot cocoa.

4877
02:14:54,480 --> 02:14:54,750
Wait,

4878
02:14:54,750 --> 02:14:58,720
because a pds is that it doesn't like
that that bigger muscle mass isn't going

4879
02:14:58,721 --> 02:15:03,420
to actually maybe dictate that you're
going to have better use of that muscle

4880
02:15:03,421 --> 02:15:04,254
mass.

4881
02:15:05,730 --> 02:15:08,040
Well the lightest guy in
the UFC and title fights,

4882
02:15:08,041 --> 02:15:08,461
it's pissed.

4883
02:15:08,461 --> 02:15:11,610
Hot has been a Allah
Allah Ya bug routine off.

4884
02:15:12,200 --> 02:15:13,260
He pissed off for EPO.

4885
02:15:13,290 --> 02:15:13,671
Come on.

4886
02:15:13,671 --> 02:15:17,170
Just the best one to fucking
with EPO at that weight,

4887
02:15:18,170 --> 02:15:19,320
that weight kick rocks.

4888
02:15:19,321 --> 02:15:20,154
You know what he's got?

4889
02:15:20,220 --> 02:15:22,800
He wanted to be able to do what he does,

4890
02:15:22,801 --> 02:15:26,700
which is he has like this very kinetic
style where you use a lot of muscle.

4891
02:15:26,790 --> 02:15:31,790
He explodes a lot and that shit gets
you God damn exhausted possibilities

4892
02:15:32,720 --> 02:15:35,730
fighting mighty mouse who's
sold the opposite of that.

4893
02:15:35,880 --> 02:15:37,620
Mighty mouse is super technical.

4894
02:15:37,740 --> 02:15:39,300
Every is always in the right position.

4895
02:15:39,420 --> 02:15:42,210
And even when he knocked
out like Joseph Benevidez,

4896
02:15:42,430 --> 02:15:44,910
it wasn't like some crazy windup punch,

4897
02:15:44,911 --> 02:15:46,590
you know the through all
his body weight into it.

4898
02:15:46,730 --> 02:15:50,340
Who's just super tactical that so he
could do that for a hundred rounds.

4899
02:15:50,520 --> 02:15:52,560
If somebody wanted to fight
mighty mouse for a hundred rounds,

4900
02:15:52,561 --> 02:15:53,890
you could probably fight
you for 100 rounds.

4901
02:15:54,300 --> 02:15:55,620
Just pulling guard pounds,

4902
02:15:56,340 --> 02:15:57,840
pulling guard earlier by the cage.

4903
02:15:57,900 --> 02:16:02,900
[inaudible]

4904
02:16:05,530 --> 02:16:06,363
he's a little high.

4905
02:16:06,840 --> 02:16:07,860
I really believe.

4906
02:16:08,160 --> 02:16:10,860
I believe leg locks are going to
come back in a big way in MMA.

4907
02:16:13,160 --> 02:16:14,070
Oh sweet.

4908
02:16:15,870 --> 02:16:16,621
He might have it.

4909
02:16:16,621 --> 02:16:17,870
You've got to let go of that one though,

4910
02:16:17,880 --> 02:16:18,091
right?

4911
02:16:18,091 --> 02:16:18,780
He's under that.

4912
02:16:18,780 --> 02:16:19,613
He's caught.

4913
02:16:20,700 --> 02:16:21,710
He's under the level.

4914
02:16:22,030 --> 02:16:22,750
This is the problem.

4915
02:16:22,750 --> 02:16:23,610
Leg locks right here.

4916
02:16:23,960 --> 02:16:24,470
See,

4917
02:16:24,470 --> 02:16:27,030
I don't think he should punch right and
I think she would defend the leg lock

4918
02:16:27,031 --> 02:16:30,310
can get out of the cute guys usually get
tapped out when they go to punch strike

4919
02:16:30,311 --> 02:16:35,311
before Bossy [inaudible] she is.

4920
02:16:38,440 --> 02:16:39,071
I'm not mad.

4921
02:16:39,071 --> 02:16:39,970
I don't give me raw.

4922
02:16:39,971 --> 02:16:40,900
Kicked her out of my bed.

4923
02:16:40,960 --> 02:16:43,630
I just want to hug her and marry her.

4924
02:16:43,930 --> 02:16:44,763
I would not married.

4925
02:16:46,030 --> 02:16:46,510
No.

4926

4939
02:17:11,920 --> 02:17:15,520
My girl makes her look like
Oscar the grouch with tits.

4940
02:17:16,030 --> 02:17:17,140
Holy Shit.

4941
02:17:17,141 --> 02:17:17,974
That's funny.

4942
02:17:18,950 --> 02:17:20,680
That's a funny Jolene would say.

4943
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:23,090
That's exactly like what
some Joey would say.

4944
02:17:25,240 --> 02:17:26,980
She looks like Oscar the grouch with tits.

4945
02:17:29,980 --> 02:17:30,813
It's

4946
02:17:32,700 --> 02:17:34,930

4947
02:17:34,931 --> 02:17:35,410

Boxy.

4950
02:17:42,250 --> 02:17:44,080
You don't want to be boxy at 22 either,

4951
02:17:44,081 --> 02:17:44,530
by the way.

4952
02:17:44,530 --> 02:17:46,900
You really don't because when
you get 32 will look different.

4953
02:17:47,650 --> 02:17:52,650
48 hot discipline girls
that never talk about it.

4954
02:17:53,551 --> 02:17:53,921

4959
02:18:03,540 --> 02:18:04,660

4961
02:18:05,101 --> 02:18:06,130
I'm like fucking TMZ.

4962
02:18:06,131 --> 02:18:09,040
I heard Rihanna broke up with Leonardo
Dicaprio cause she said that he just,

4963
02:18:09,190 --> 02:18:10,390
he has too much of a belly.

4964
02:18:10,410 --> 02:18:11,243
They were dating.

4965
02:18:11,250 --> 02:18:11,800

4966
02:18:11,800 --> 02:18:12,570

4967
02:18:12,570 --> 02:18:13,120
And she,

4968
02:18:13,120 --> 02:18:16,050
he had too much of a balance and
asked him you to six bed for her.

4969
02:18:16,060 --> 02:18:16,631
Really cool.

4970
02:18:16,631 --> 02:18:17,160

4974
02:18:22,150 --> 02:18:22,690
Wow.

4975
02:18:22,690 --> 02:18:23,740
Cool story Bro.

4976
02:18:23,741 --> 02:18:24,610

See,

4978
02:18:24,761 --> 02:18:25,990
where did you hear this story from?

4979
02:18:26,770 --> 02:18:27,790
Online man.

4980
02:18:31,100 --> 02:18:36,070

I'm all over that shit.

4986
02:18:44,740 --> 02:18:46,300
She's throwing them under the bus.

4987
02:18:46,540 --> 02:18:47,710
Said he had too much of a gut.

4988
02:18:48,430 --> 02:18:49,360
That's hilarious.

4989
02:18:50,200 --> 02:18:50,471
Yeah.

4990
02:18:50,471 --> 02:18:50,591
He's,

4991
02:18:50,591 --> 02:18:54,850
he doesn't have fucking time to work out
cause he's doing a list movie all the

4992
02:18:54,851 --> 02:18:55,860
Goddamn time.

4993
02:18:55,861 --> 02:18:58,180
We're picking up all
these officers and blow.

4994
02:18:58,860 --> 02:18:59,693
Yeah.

4995
02:18:59,920 --> 02:19:02,960

4996
02:19:05,520 --> 02:19:07,270
Tait Fletcher just went there.

4997
02:19:07,271 --> 02:19:08,140
Did you hear that?

4998
02:19:08,420 --> 02:19:09,640
Did you seem him to Django?

4999
02:19:09,670 --> 02:19:11,440
Did you not hear what tapad is incredible.

5000
02:19:12,570 --> 02:19:13,540
He was incredible.

5001
02:19:13,541 --> 02:19:13,781
Damn.

5002
02:19:13,781 --> 02:19:15,550
Max Holloway just landed
a nice right hand.

5003
02:19:22,660 --> 02:19:23,171
You know what?

5004
02:19:23,171 --> 02:19:24,004
You don't see that,

5005
02:19:24,860 --> 02:19:25,160
you know,

5006
02:19:25,160 --> 02:19:27,230
you don't see that much
to them and made that uh,

5007
02:19:27,710 --> 02:19:28,490
Roy Mcdonald's

5008
02:19:28,490 --> 02:19:29,390
does so well.

5009
02:19:29,570 --> 02:19:31,850
Is that question mark kick
like I was just looking,

5010
02:19:31,851 --> 02:19:34,730
Cole Miller grazed the top
of his head with a kick.

5011
02:19:34,880 --> 02:19:35,061
Right.

5012
02:19:35,061 --> 02:19:38,420
And I was like that Kik will you come up
and it looks like a front kick and then

5013
02:19:38,421 --> 02:19:40,730
you turn into the Brazilian style.

5014
02:19:40,750 --> 02:19:42,170
Roni does it almost every fall.

5015
02:19:42,171 --> 02:19:44,600
He does look again.

5016
02:19:45,250 --> 02:19:46,100
Let's look at that.

5017
02:19:46,160 --> 02:19:47,450
Rory does it really well.

5018
02:19:48,440 --> 02:19:50,750
I think Serone and a
motherfucker out with it though.

5019
02:19:51,020 --> 02:19:52,190
She only so good at it,

5020
02:19:52,191 --> 02:19:52,430
man.

5021
02:19:52,430 --> 02:19:52,740
Yeah,

5022
02:19:52,740 --> 02:19:55,030
that's Ronnie does out pay.

5023
02:19:55,031 --> 02:19:56,300
Owe a lot of dudes.

5024
02:19:56,660 --> 02:19:57,830
You know who's good at it too.

5025
02:19:58,070 --> 02:19:58,311
Who?

5026
02:19:58,311 --> 02:19:59,570
The very first person I ever,

5027
02:19:59,900 --> 02:20:02,330
ever saw do it and knock the dude out.

5028
02:20:02,390 --> 02:20:03,740
Mark [inaudible] mark.

5029
02:20:03,770 --> 02:20:04,280
Nope.

5030
02:20:04,280 --> 02:20:05,690
That really,

5031
02:20:05,990 --> 02:20:06,711
really right.

5032
02:20:06,711 --> 02:20:07,300
If that,

5033
02:20:07,300 --> 02:20:07,780
you know,

5034
02:20:07,780 --> 02:20:08,570
uh,

5035
02:20:08,570 --> 02:20:11,240
pedis can do both
traditional and south Paul.

5036
02:20:11,730 --> 02:20:13,760
That's both like a motherfucker.

5037
02:20:13,910 --> 02:20:14,680
Oh No,

5038
02:20:14,680 --> 02:20:17,590
I got to son.

5039
02:20:18,800 --> 02:20:19,380
He's not going to,

5040
02:20:19,380 --> 02:20:21,500
he's like looking for parts
of his eye in his poem.

5041
02:20:21,560 --> 02:20:22,400
Damn.

5042
02:20:23,090 --> 02:20:24,290
Oh.

5043
02:20:24,291 --> 02:20:25,124
Ruins.

5044
02:20:25,130 --> 02:20:26,390
Oh my God.

5045
02:20:27,170 --> 02:20:28,050
You've seen Biz beings.

5046
02:20:28,051 --> 02:20:29,920
I just shot a show with Disney has that.

5047
02:20:31,090 --> 02:20:32,210
She has careers.

5048
02:20:33,260 --> 02:20:34,280
It's bleeding.

5049
02:20:34,310 --> 02:20:35,300
This is awful.

5050
02:20:35,990 --> 02:20:36,710
Oh Shit.

5051
02:20:36,710 --> 02:20:39,950
Is that the eyebrow that's bleeding
or the eyeball that's bleeding?

5052
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:41,100
I hope it's eyebrow.

5053
02:20:41,250 --> 02:20:42,083
I hope.

5054
02:20:42,650 --> 02:20:43,483
Look at this.

5055
02:20:43,490 --> 02:20:44,323
Look at

5056
02:20:45,770 --> 02:20:46,580
Po.

5057
02:20:46,580 --> 02:20:46,731
Oh,

5058
02:20:46,731 --> 02:20:48,820
it's a heads up that's

5059
02:20:50,570 --> 02:20:52,450
telling me I had no big God.

5060
02:20:52,451 --> 02:20:52,701
Damn,

5061
02:20:52,701 --> 02:20:54,410
that sits a bad cut then there isn't that

5062
02:20:55,930 --> 02:20:57,380
a horrible spot.

5063
02:20:57,440 --> 02:20:59,630
They'll stop it way better
than what I imagine.

5064
02:20:59,631 --> 02:21:00,470
That's a big cut,

5065
02:21:00,471 --> 02:21:01,304
man.

5066
02:21:02,010 --> 02:21:02,843
It's not that big.

5067
02:21:02,850 --> 02:21:03,120
It's the,

5068
02:21:03,120 --> 02:21:04,580
I look at the top of the eyebrow.

5069
02:21:05,150 --> 02:21:07,790
I'm looking at the blood coming down
the corner and I was assuming that that

5070
02:21:07,791 --> 02:21:08,460
whole thing was kind.

5071
02:21:08,460 --> 02:21:11,110
I don't think that was my first referee.

5072
02:21:11,890 --> 02:21:13,610
The referee said they keep going,

5073
02:21:13,611 --> 02:21:13,970
but he's,

5074
02:21:13,970 --> 02:21:14,390
he said,

5075
02:21:14,390 --> 02:21:15,650
you got to clean my eye,

5076
02:21:16,060 --> 02:21:17,480
so what's it going in my eyes?

5077
02:21:17,510 --> 02:21:17,790
Yeah.

5078
02:21:17,790 --> 02:21:20,940
Did they bring somebody around
waving it off to me he was,

5079
02:21:21,770 --> 02:21:21,920
oh,

5080
02:21:21,920 --> 02:21:22,360
no,

5081
02:21:22,360 --> 02:21:22,670
no,

5082
02:21:22,670 --> 02:21:23,420
no,

5083
02:21:23,420 --> 02:21:24,710
but he's not going to clean it off.

5084
02:21:24,711 --> 02:21:25,670
I don't understand that.

5085
02:21:27,560 --> 02:21:28,580
Then what did they do?

5086
02:21:28,581 --> 02:21:29,151
Did they don't,

5087
02:21:29,151 --> 02:21:30,200
they usually cleaned it off.

5088
02:21:30,201 --> 02:21:32,600
If there's a headbutt
like a cut like that,

5089
02:21:32,601 --> 02:21:33,470
they have to look at it.

5090
02:21:33,471 --> 02:21:35,510
Doctor come in or someone
come in and look at it.

5091
02:21:35,511 --> 02:21:36,560
Yet they usually,

5092
02:21:36,650 --> 02:21:37,910
that's where I would think they would do.

5093
02:21:38,360 --> 02:21:40,750
It's only if the fighter can't
see those don't affect him,

5094
02:21:40,751 --> 02:21:41,331
his eyesight,

5095
02:21:41,331 --> 02:21:42,360
but it is right now.

5096
02:21:42,361 --> 02:21:42,560
It's,

5097
02:21:42,560 --> 02:21:43,400
it's affecting his eyes.

5098
02:21:43,401 --> 02:21:44,900
Said he's trying to
wipe it out of his eye,

5099
02:21:44,930 --> 02:21:46,280
but only if it's in the eye.

5100
02:21:46,310 --> 02:21:47,071
If it's going around,

5101
02:21:47,071 --> 02:21:47,220
I,

5102
02:21:47,220 --> 02:21:48,021
they don't stop it.

5103
02:21:48,021 --> 02:21:48,854
If it's in the eye,

5104
02:21:48,870 --> 02:21:52,250
then the doctor though the referee
brothers coming over to talk to him,

5105
02:21:52,700 --> 02:21:53,630
he gets five minutes,

5106
02:21:53,631 --> 02:21:54,050
right?

5107
02:21:54,050 --> 02:21:54,591
Five minutes.

5108
02:21:54,591 --> 02:21:54,770
Yeah.

5109
02:21:54,770 --> 02:21:55,221
So he's saying,

5110
02:21:55,221 --> 02:21:55,581
fuck it.

5111
02:21:55,581 --> 02:21:56,414
Let's go.

5112
02:21:56,930 --> 02:21:57,763
He goes,

5113
02:21:58,070 --> 02:21:59,720
sometime this fiery guys up.

5114
02:21:59,721 --> 02:22:01,100
This could be the change in the match.

5115
02:22:01,101 --> 02:22:01,670
You know what I'm saying?

5116
02:22:01,670 --> 02:22:02,391
Dude gets pissed.

5117
02:22:02,391 --> 02:22:02,901
Well Dude,

5118
02:22:02,901 --> 02:22:03,734
like Cole Miller,

5119
02:22:03,890 --> 02:22:08,210
he's been fighting angry since he
was a baby that shits in his jeans.

5120
02:22:08,211 --> 02:22:09,080
He's from the south.

5121
02:22:11,980 --> 02:22:14,450
Cole Miller can scrap these scraps.

5122
02:22:15,670 --> 02:22:16,740
Is that inside leg kick?

5123
02:22:17,270 --> 02:22:17,600
I don't know.

5124
02:22:17,600 --> 02:22:18,160
If only knows.

5125
02:22:18,160 --> 02:22:22,130
Hit Max Holloway acts and Ben
Henderson have the exact same back.

5126
02:22:22,131 --> 02:22:23,840
That two identical.

5127
02:22:24,320 --> 02:22:25,153
It's true.

5128
02:22:25,380 --> 02:22:25,591
No,

5129
02:22:25,591 --> 02:22:30,120
but isn't Benson's like angel wings and
his is like one angel and one devil is

5130
02:22:30,121 --> 02:22:30,330
it?

5131
02:22:30,330 --> 02:22:30,931
I think Max,

5132
02:22:30,931 --> 02:22:34,230
one of them is like a a devil wing
and one of them's an angel wing.

5133
02:22:34,410 --> 02:22:36,030
I'm not sure someone has that,

5134
02:22:36,150 --> 02:22:36,983
but one of the guys,

5135
02:22:37,660 --> 02:22:38,000
well,

5136
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:38,610
the,

5137
02:22:38,610 --> 02:22:38,761
yeah,

5138
02:22:38,761 --> 02:22:39,594
that's right.

5139
02:22:39,940 --> 02:22:40,440
That right.

5140
02:22:40,440 --> 02:22:41,251
One's a little different.

5141
02:22:41,251 --> 02:22:42,700
Is it going to say,

5142
02:22:42,900 --> 02:22:43,021
well,

5143
02:22:43,021 --> 02:22:43,980
we'll see what he turns around.

5144
02:22:44,450 --> 02:22:45,230
Well,

5145
02:22:45,230 --> 02:22:46,230
there is one fighter.

5146
02:22:46,260 --> 02:22:46,520
Yeah,

5147
02:22:46,520 --> 02:22:47,250
they're both,

5148
02:22:47,250 --> 02:22:47,850
they're different.

5149
02:22:47,850 --> 02:22:49,230
Maybe they're just two
different kinds of birds,

5150
02:22:49,500 --> 02:22:51,990
but one dude has it where
one side looks like,

5151
02:22:51,991 --> 02:22:53,220
like a bat wing,

5152
02:22:53,520 --> 02:22:53,850
you know,

5153
02:22:53,850 --> 02:22:58,170
I don't know his kids right when it
looks like a battling that left one looks

5154
02:22:58,171 --> 02:22:59,850
like tattoos.

5155
02:22:59,940 --> 02:23:01,560
This is getting real gay boys.

5156
02:23:01,760 --> 02:23:01,980
Ooh,

5157
02:23:01,980 --> 02:23:02,960
nice low.

5158
02:23:03,110 --> 02:23:03,890
Yeah.

5159
02:23:03,890 --> 02:23:04,723
Huh.

5160
02:23:07,420 --> 02:23:07,781
You know,

5161
02:23:07,781 --> 02:23:08,411
like sponsors,

5162
02:23:08,411 --> 02:23:09,400
like alien ware.

5163
02:23:09,430 --> 02:23:10,141
It's going to be weird.

5164
02:23:10,141 --> 02:23:12,220
And then not allowed
to sponsor UFC fights.

5165
02:23:12,221 --> 02:23:13,300
I've used to see in that,

5166
02:23:13,450 --> 02:23:15,130
that alien logo for so fuck.

5167
02:23:15,160 --> 02:23:15,311
Yeah,

5168
02:23:15,311 --> 02:23:15,551
it is.

5169
02:23:15,551 --> 02:23:17,130
It's at one of them is like a devil way,

5170
02:23:17,150 --> 02:23:17,983
right?

5171
02:23:18,060 --> 02:23:18,893
Yeah.

5172
02:23:19,240 --> 02:23:20,320
Oh,

5173
02:23:20,321 --> 02:23:22,270
that Combo was nasty,

5174
02:23:28,520 --> 02:23:29,900
but it's going to be sad seeing those,

5175
02:23:29,901 --> 02:23:30,290
uh,

5176
02:23:30,290 --> 02:23:30,890
those,

5177
02:23:30,890 --> 02:23:31,970
those sponsors go,

5178
02:23:31,971 --> 02:23:34,120
those sponsors support or a lot of bison,

5179
02:23:34,780 --> 02:23:36,560
especially a alien ware man.

5180
02:23:36,561 --> 02:23:38,960
They've been around so
long supporting fighters.

5181
02:23:39,470 --> 02:23:40,730
I bought an Alienware computer,

5182
02:23:40,731 --> 02:23:43,190
even used them to sponsor
my podcast just to Sorta,

5183
02:23:43,760 --> 02:23:45,950
there's still bellatore
to say that you know,

5184
02:23:45,951 --> 02:23:49,970
like just to respect them because
you know it's like it's a big deal.

5185
02:23:50,020 --> 02:23:51,860
He about High Bussa
they've been around a grip.

5186
02:23:51,980 --> 02:23:52,470
Yup.

5187
02:23:52,470 --> 02:23:52,900
Yup.

5188
02:23:52,900 --> 02:23:53,410
They have.

5189
02:23:53,410 --> 02:23:53,601
Yes.

5190
02:23:53,601 --> 02:23:55,080
They have to make some mixed.

5191
02:23:55,090 --> 02:23:56,360
The best ankle straps,

5192
02:23:56,390 --> 02:23:57,770
they covered the whole instep.

5193
02:23:57,940 --> 02:23:58,451
They're the bad.

5194
02:23:58,451 --> 02:24:01,810
They're the only brand that covers
the whole insect killer that bad.

5195
02:24:01,811 --> 02:24:02,230
Right now.

5196
02:24:02,230 --> 02:24:05,750
It's like they can't see patty or no,

5197
02:24:05,900 --> 02:24:06,700
am I right?

5198
02:24:06,700 --> 02:24:07,130
There's little,

5199
02:24:07,130 --> 02:24:10,160
it's kind of like padding
to tie pads or the Shit,

5200
02:24:10,161 --> 02:24:10,520
man.

5201
02:24:10,520 --> 02:24:11,840
They're the best type ads.

5202
02:24:11,990 --> 02:24:15,320
Like there's a real difference in like
how they feel to the guy who holds him

5203
02:24:16,340 --> 02:24:17,960
after I'd be done holding them with you.

5204
02:24:17,960 --> 02:24:18,530
I would.

5205
02:24:18,530 --> 02:24:20,120
My tricep should be burning up,

5206
02:24:21,370 --> 02:24:22,203
ma'am.

5207
02:24:23,450 --> 02:24:24,980
How long have you guys
been trained together?

5208
02:24:25,930 --> 02:24:27,410
It's a long time.

5209
02:24:27,660 --> 02:24:28,580
Came in twice.

5210
02:24:30,090 --> 02:24:30,923
Anything knows.

5211
02:24:31,080 --> 02:24:32,720
That's how bad it looks.

5212
02:24:32,721 --> 02:24:33,554
Bad,

5213
02:24:33,650 --> 02:24:35,600
bad place shaped like a head.

5214
02:24:35,630 --> 02:24:36,001
Yeah.

5215
02:24:36,001 --> 02:24:36,231
Yeah,

5216
02:24:36,231 --> 02:24:37,064
yeah.

5217
02:24:37,170 --> 02:24:38,003
Cool.

5218
02:24:38,050 --> 02:24:38,630
No,

5219
02:24:38,630 --> 02:24:39,290
terrible.

5220
02:24:39,290 --> 02:24:40,040
I think it's cold.

5221
02:24:40,040 --> 02:24:40,950
Oh my God.

5222
02:24:40,980 --> 02:24:41,960
It's huge.

5223
02:24:43,430 --> 02:24:44,370
I think it's a great idea,

5224
02:24:46,250 --> 02:24:47,083
son.

5225
02:24:47,360 --> 02:24:48,350
Dude did you see the cut?

5226
02:24:48,380 --> 02:24:49,213
It got bigger.

5227
02:24:49,220 --> 02:24:54,220
I think it got bigger and big caught
his final punch when he was in the guard

5228
02:24:54,560 --> 02:24:57,110
right before the bell was
right on the button again.

5229
02:24:57,170 --> 02:24:58,003
Oh really?

5230
02:24:58,190 --> 02:24:59,540
See that's kind of fucked up,

5231
02:24:59,541 --> 02:24:59,780
right?

5232
02:24:59,780 --> 02:25:00,950
Oh look at this.

5233
02:25:01,160 --> 02:25:01,580
Nope.

5234
02:25:01,580 --> 02:25:03,170
That's nothing right.

5235
02:25:03,171 --> 02:25:04,760
They're terrible highlight.

5236
02:25:04,970 --> 02:25:05,810
But it's not like a hat,

5237
02:25:05,811 --> 02:25:08,810
but it's just like he's rubbing
it like he's just going to die,

5238
02:25:08,940 --> 02:25:09,773
man.

5239
02:25:09,880 --> 02:25:10,310
Yeah.

5240
02:25:10,310 --> 02:25:11,930
It's unfortunate that your eyes fuck up,

5241
02:25:11,931 --> 02:25:13,400
but well the mind,

5242
02:25:13,410 --> 02:25:17,000
the amount of known it was a little
fucked up when he's grabbing his head in

5243
02:25:17,001 --> 02:25:17,834
there.

5244
02:25:17,960 --> 02:25:18,980
Let's be honest though,

5245
02:25:18,981 --> 02:25:19,520
for sure.

5246
02:25:19,520 --> 02:25:19,840
I mean he's,

5247
02:25:19,840 --> 02:25:22,640
he's aware his head hitting the cut.

5248
02:25:23,290 --> 02:25:24,310
It's pretty bad though.

5249
02:25:24,340 --> 02:25:26,670
It's a lot worse than I thought
it was cool to feel in drag.

5250
02:25:26,680 --> 02:25:27,850
Drop it in front of his eye.

5251
02:25:28,900 --> 02:25:29,051
Yeah.

5252
02:25:29,051 --> 02:25:32,980
But when a company like high Bussa like
take something like tie pads that have

5253
02:25:32,981 --> 02:25:37,480
existed forever and just
makes an improvement like
that where you know you could

5254
02:25:37,481 --> 02:25:38,890
absorb harder kicks with them.

5255
02:25:39,040 --> 02:25:41,950
There was a way they can
make their cushioning,

5256
02:25:42,100 --> 02:25:42,933
whatever it is,

5257
02:25:43,040 --> 02:25:45,370
he doesn't hurt nearly as hard
when someone's kicking that.

5258
02:25:45,400 --> 02:25:49,350
Have you ever had blood
in you on the spot?

5259
02:25:51,160 --> 02:25:52,030
Cause the oil,

5260
02:25:52,060 --> 02:25:52,893
the oil,

5261
02:25:52,980 --> 02:25:55,060
you can swipe it just doesn't go away.

5262
02:25:55,090 --> 02:25:58,420
It's like having a film of
straight motor oil in your eye.

5263
02:25:58,480 --> 02:25:59,620
You just can't get it off.

5264
02:25:59,980 --> 02:26:00,880
It sucks man.

5265
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:02,890
Everything's blurry up Coles.

5266
02:26:03,190 --> 02:26:03,851
He's in trouble,

5267
02:26:03,851 --> 02:26:04,684
man.

5268
02:26:06,190 --> 02:26:08,110
Max Holloway is a tough kid,

5269
02:26:08,111 --> 02:26:08,830
man.

5270
02:26:08,830 --> 02:26:11,020
And he's had some tough
fucking fights in the UFC,

5271
02:26:11,050 --> 02:26:12,000
but he's night.

5272
02:26:12,280 --> 02:26:12,461
Yeah,

5273
02:26:12,461 --> 02:26:14,250
he fought Conor when he,

5274
02:26:14,380 --> 02:26:18,400
he made a decision because kind of blew
his ankle or his ACL out and I met up

5275
02:26:18,401 --> 02:26:19,211
with Connor yesterday.

5276
02:26:19,211 --> 02:26:20,044
He was in Venice.

5277
02:26:20,050 --> 02:26:21,910
He's a big ass dude.

5278
02:26:22,510 --> 02:26:23,081
Hell yeah.

5279
02:26:23,081 --> 02:26:23,800
He's big.

5280
02:26:23,800 --> 02:26:25,330
Conor McGregor is,

5281
02:26:26,050 --> 02:26:28,750
I get to one 45 like a professional fuck.

5282
02:26:28,751 --> 02:26:29,030
He's,

5283
02:26:29,030 --> 02:26:29,900
he's a genius.

5284
02:26:32,570 --> 02:26:35,920
He's got to get by Josie Aldo.

5285
02:26:35,980 --> 02:26:37,560
Oh,

5286
02:26:37,690 --> 02:26:38,350
got some tough.

5287
02:26:38,350 --> 02:26:39,183
That's a tough,

5288
02:26:39,420 --> 02:26:40,540
a tall drink.

5289
02:26:41,530 --> 02:26:41,981
Josie.

5290
02:26:41,981 --> 02:26:42,920
All know for him though,

5291
02:26:42,970 --> 02:26:45,850
Conor McGregor versus me
get star Anthony Pettis.

5292
02:26:45,851 --> 02:26:47,260
Think about fucking Matt.

5293
02:26:47,530 --> 02:26:48,340
I agree.

5294
02:26:48,340 --> 02:26:49,030
He's not going to,

5295
02:26:49,030 --> 02:26:50,680
that's going to be a
different fight for Conor,

5296
02:26:50,681 --> 02:26:50,831
right?

5297
02:26:50,831 --> 02:26:50,981
Yeah.

5298
02:26:50,981 --> 02:26:51,730
But wait a minute.

5299
02:26:51,730 --> 02:26:53,200
What about Frankie Edgar?

5300
02:26:53,201 --> 02:26:55,510
What about trying to do,

5301
02:26:55,910 --> 02:26:56,530
what are you trying to do?

5302
02:26:56,530 --> 02:26:57,460
You want to see him loose?

5303
02:26:57,850 --> 02:26:58,181
No,

5304
02:26:58,181 --> 02:26:59,850
we need Panisse.

5305
02:27:00,800 --> 02:27:02,410
Needham's yes,

5306
02:27:02,680 --> 02:27:03,910
he's going to wrestle him and I'm like,

5307
02:27:03,940 --> 02:27:05,040
I'm all list.

5308
02:27:05,041 --> 02:27:05,651
I Love Frankie,

5309
02:27:05,651 --> 02:27:06,010
but I'm,

5310
02:27:06,010 --> 02:27:07,390
I'm team Connor after yesterday.

5311
02:27:07,391 --> 02:27:07,601
Man.

5312
02:27:07,601 --> 02:27:08,680
He's a good dude.

5313
02:27:08,860 --> 02:27:09,740
I'm all team Connor.

5314
02:27:09,890 --> 02:27:11,340
I it with the right matchup.

5315
02:27:11,390 --> 02:27:11,950
That kid,

5316
02:27:11,950 --> 02:27:12,250
he's,

5317
02:27:12,250 --> 02:27:13,420
I think he's our biggest star.

5318
02:27:13,740 --> 02:27:14,130
Um,

5319
02:27:14,130 --> 02:27:14,620
easily.

5320
02:27:14,620 --> 02:27:16,900
I love Frankie Edgar meet you.

5321
02:27:16,901 --> 02:27:18,220
Love Conor McGregor too.

5322
02:27:18,400 --> 02:27:22,750
I don't want to pick a side because
there's part of me that was so I love Cub

5323
02:27:22,750 --> 02:27:23,890
Swanson to WHO's cuddlers caught?

5324
02:27:23,980 --> 02:27:24,251
Pardon me?

5325
02:27:24,251 --> 02:27:27,790
That was so impressed with Frankie
after the cubs wants and fight.

5326
02:27:27,791 --> 02:27:30,310
I think it's a crime to not get
my title shot after to that.

5327
02:27:30,370 --> 02:27:30,701
I agree.

5328
02:27:30,701 --> 02:27:31,420
I agree.

5329
02:27:31,420 --> 02:27:32,260
I think it's a crime.

5330
02:27:32,350 --> 02:27:33,490
The defense team beaten cub,

5331
02:27:33,491 --> 02:27:36,220
Swanson like that and beaten Dennis
Seaver at the end of his rope.

5332
02:27:36,250 --> 02:27:37,210
Is it just totally,

5333
02:27:37,211 --> 02:27:38,290
you know why it took time?

5334
02:27:38,291 --> 02:27:40,240
Because think about what
Frankie's gone through.

5335
02:27:40,320 --> 02:27:41,820
Think about Frankie's robe,

5336
02:27:41,910 --> 02:27:42,400
right?

5337
02:27:42,400 --> 02:27:46,150
But the thing is if you get Frankie
Connor Union destroy to superstar,

5338
02:27:46,960 --> 02:27:47,793
do that man.

5339
02:27:48,190 --> 02:27:48,551
Well,

5340
02:27:48,551 --> 02:27:49,384
you gotta

5341
02:27:50,900 --> 02:27:51,570
give this,

5342
02:27:51,570 --> 02:27:53,010
you can give it a you.

5343
02:27:53,410 --> 02:27:55,830
Although that is key.

5344
02:27:55,840 --> 02:27:57,070
The fight with Aldo.

5345
02:27:57,220 --> 02:27:58,053
Okay.

5346
02:27:58,270 --> 02:27:59,680
Whoever wins that fight,

5347
02:27:59,770 --> 02:28:00,940
then Connor fights that.

5348
02:28:01,600 --> 02:28:02,470
That's how I would do it.

5349
02:28:02,830 --> 02:28:04,800
I give common one more warm up.

5350
02:28:05,770 --> 02:28:07,580
Most of Connor fighting Aldo.

5351
02:28:07,740 --> 02:28:08,890
If he wins.

5352
02:28:08,980 --> 02:28:09,640
Okay.

5353
02:28:09,640 --> 02:28:10,440
Diverse.

5354
02:28:10,440 --> 02:28:11,021
Goddamn.

5355
02:28:11,021 --> 02:28:12,220
That's I like,

5356
02:28:12,250 --> 02:28:13,510
I like seeing Aldo,

5357
02:28:13,511 --> 02:28:13,871
Josie,

5358
02:28:13,871 --> 02:28:14,620
all the right now.

5359
02:28:14,620 --> 02:28:16,030
I like that as a fan.

5360
02:28:16,180 --> 02:28:16,720
I love it.

5361
02:28:16,720 --> 02:28:18,280
Exactly that UFC note,

5362
02:28:18,310 --> 02:28:18,701
Connor,

5363
02:28:18,701 --> 02:28:19,031
Josie,

5364
02:28:19,031 --> 02:28:21,860
all the right and the Ui and he knows that

5365
02:28:24,430 --> 02:28:27,290
that's the way the matchmaking Japan,

5366
02:28:27,530 --> 02:28:30,190
they think of a fucking
match up and they do it well.

5367
02:28:30,210 --> 02:28:31,760
You don't have to build up the shit.

5368
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:32,271
It's like,

5369
02:28:32,271 --> 02:28:34,160
let's make it happen right now.

5370
02:28:34,190 --> 02:28:36,980
I just feel happy about it
as common as management.

5371
02:28:36,981 --> 02:28:37,341
I'm like,

5372
02:28:37,341 --> 02:28:37,581
Bro,

5373
02:28:37,581 --> 02:28:39,380
let's get one more it.

5374
02:28:39,500 --> 02:28:41,390
You're in a fight kind
of a grappler wrestler,

5375
02:28:41,460 --> 02:28:42,530
cause don't get it twisted.

5376
02:28:42,531 --> 02:28:43,610
All those a black belt,

5377
02:28:44,300 --> 02:28:45,140
it goes to the ground.

5378
02:28:45,141 --> 02:28:47,180
There's gonna be some issues
there and he can wrestle.

5379
02:28:47,440 --> 02:28:49,160
He's hard as fuck to take down to,

5380
02:28:49,430 --> 02:28:52,910
I say you give him one more match up with
kind of a grappler guy who's going to

5381
02:28:52,911 --> 02:28:53,750
try and take him down.

5382
02:28:53,780 --> 02:28:55,490
I think Conor is going to,

5383
02:28:57,470 --> 02:28:59,030
I think Conor is going
to hurt him standing.

5384
02:28:59,040 --> 02:29:02,270
I don't think it's going to go to the
ground and then he really hits that hard.

5385
02:29:02,480 --> 02:29:04,730
How many more minutes do we have to see?

5386
02:29:05,600 --> 02:29:05,901
You know?

5387
02:29:05,901 --> 02:29:08,810
You know why he's so confident is I
really think that everyone that he's

5388
02:29:08,811 --> 02:29:09,680
training with this going,

5389
02:29:09,681 --> 02:29:10,940
Holy Shit,

5390
02:29:11,510 --> 02:29:11,991
this guy,

5391
02:29:11,991 --> 02:29:12,651
it's so hard,

5392
02:29:12,651 --> 02:29:12,981
and he's like,

5393
02:29:12,981 --> 02:29:13,910
fucking everybody up.

5394
02:29:13,911 --> 02:29:15,050
That's the confidence he has.

5395
02:29:15,890 --> 02:29:16,940
He's proving it.

5396
02:29:17,360 --> 02:29:18,080
He's hurt.

5397
02:29:18,080 --> 02:29:20,430
He hit Dennis Cbre with a
couple shots in dentistry.

5398
02:29:20,450 --> 02:29:21,740
We started buckling quick.

5399
02:29:21,890 --> 02:29:26,810
If was system power as Joel get shy
came stiff once he thought the power.

5400
02:29:26,811 --> 02:29:29,210
Now he was stiff from when
he flew in on Tuesday.

5401
02:29:29,240 --> 02:29:29,421
Yeah.

5402
02:29:29,421 --> 02:29:29,901
By the way,

5403
02:29:29,901 --> 02:29:31,280
knocked out Dustin poray.

5404
02:29:31,281 --> 02:29:33,950
Nobody ever did that before and I'm
saying I'm on the top of his head.

5405
02:29:34,160 --> 02:29:35,000
I think he really,

5406
02:29:35,270 --> 02:29:39,980
he's so confident because he knows that
these guys at 45 can't take his power

5407
02:29:40,820 --> 02:29:41,240
animal.

5408
02:29:41,240 --> 02:29:43,280
He's not saying the guy's
at 55 could take his power.

5409
02:29:43,490 --> 02:29:46,610
I wouldn't be surprised if if
like let's say he'd be Josie,

5410
02:29:46,620 --> 02:29:47,300
I was on his end.

5411
02:29:47,300 --> 02:29:48,510
He's going to fight Anthony Pettis,

5412
02:29:48,580 --> 02:29:48,980
right?

5413
02:29:48,980 --> 02:29:49,813
It's going to be him.

5414
02:29:49,940 --> 02:29:51,710
I wouldn't be surprised if Connor said,

5415
02:29:51,980 --> 02:29:52,700
hey,

5416
02:29:52,700 --> 02:29:56,240
I knew for a fact that could be all those
guys at one 45 I knew there was no way

5417
02:29:56,241 --> 02:29:57,230
they were going to handle my power.

5418
02:29:57,530 --> 02:29:58,311
Anthony Pettis,

5419
02:29:58,311 --> 02:29:59,144
he's like me.

5420
02:29:59,150 --> 02:30:00,200
He's got serious power.

5421
02:30:00,201 --> 02:30:01,040
Crazy strikes.

5422
02:30:01,190 --> 02:30:01,420
Ooh,

5423
02:30:01,420 --> 02:30:02,660
this is like a 50 50 fight.

5424
02:30:03,170 --> 02:30:03,801
You know what I mean?

5425
02:30:03,801 --> 02:30:06,230
I this guy to overlook
this guy would be stupid.

5426
02:30:06,410 --> 02:30:07,221
This guy is a beast.

5427
02:30:07,221 --> 02:30:08,054
He's just like me.

5428
02:30:08,090 --> 02:30:09,950
We'll see what happens though.

5429
02:30:09,951 --> 02:30:11,560
Sonya says fighting pedestal,

5430
02:30:11,570 --> 02:30:11,811
man.

5431
02:30:11,811 --> 02:30:12,710
That's going to be a good one.

5432
02:30:13,700 --> 02:30:14,240
Yes.

5433
02:30:14,240 --> 02:30:14,541
Yes.

5434
02:30:14,541 --> 02:30:16,750
Competitors just seems
fucking unstoppable,

5435
02:30:16,760 --> 02:30:17,300
dude.

5436
02:30:17,300 --> 02:30:20,600
He's so confident and you take them
down and submit you in a second.

5437
02:30:20,770 --> 02:30:23,790
You're taking up those Angeles
grapplings up beast man

5438
02:30:25,490 --> 02:30:26,810
pedes can submit anybody.

5439
02:30:27,650 --> 02:30:29,120
They'll submit any by Henderson.

5440
02:30:29,121 --> 02:30:29,600
I agree.

5441
02:30:29,600 --> 02:30:29,930
He,

5442
02:30:29,930 --> 02:30:31,880
that guy knows how to squeeze Max.

5443
02:30:31,910 --> 02:30:33,020
He knows how to take arms.

5444
02:30:33,150 --> 02:30:35,000
He's very good on the ground.

5445
02:30:35,001 --> 02:30:38,760
He's a finisher and the way he throws
a stretch so powerful with no wind up,

5446
02:30:39,200 --> 02:30:41,840
he just doesn't wind up right.

5447
02:30:41,920 --> 02:30:43,250
He throws some taekwondo styles.

5448
02:30:43,251 --> 02:30:43,401
Yeah.

5449
02:30:43,401 --> 02:30:45,260
There's no way with power,

5450
02:30:45,340 --> 02:30:47,060
they'll say everybody's going
to be a tougher fight for him.

5451
02:30:47,061 --> 02:30:48,920
I think though it's going
to be a tough fight,

5452
02:30:48,921 --> 02:30:49,431
but well,

5453
02:30:49,431 --> 02:30:52,330
the tough fight off Habib number good.

5454
02:30:52,340 --> 02:30:54,530
Madoff is the tough dude.

5455
02:30:54,531 --> 02:30:55,670
I'm trying to tell cowboy,

5456
02:30:55,700 --> 02:30:56,690
don't fight him,

5457
02:30:56,691 --> 02:30:57,140
man.

5458
02:30:57,140 --> 02:31:01,700
Wait for your fucking title shot
because at one 55 to get a top shot,

5459
02:31:01,701 --> 02:31:03,650
it's going to be a fucking nightmare.

5460
02:31:03,680 --> 02:31:04,880
Is he going to fight that guy?

5461
02:31:05,300 --> 02:31:07,170
Is that the the story man,

5462
02:31:07,290 --> 02:31:09,560
so they trying to set
that fight up for sure.

5463
02:31:09,590 --> 02:31:12,250
You just fought fucking
six times in a week.

5464
02:31:12,260 --> 02:31:12,690
Could be.

5465
02:31:12,690 --> 02:31:14,430
Takes the time gangster.

5466
02:31:15,390 --> 02:31:15,680
Yeah.

5467
02:31:15,680 --> 02:31:16,730
It's great to be gangster,

5468
02:31:16,731 --> 02:31:18,350
but a certain point in his
management needs to be like,

5469
02:31:18,351 --> 02:31:18,650
dude,

5470
02:31:18,650 --> 02:31:19,483
sit out.

5471
02:31:19,530 --> 02:31:19,941
You'll matter.

5472
02:31:19,941 --> 02:31:20,400
One

5473
02:31:20,400 --> 02:31:21,390
will never fade away.

5474
02:31:21,450 --> 02:31:23,070
Cabo will be around for as long as he can,

5475
02:31:23,071 --> 02:31:23,731
which is great.

5476
02:31:23,731 --> 02:31:24,210
Which is great.

5477
02:31:24,210 --> 02:31:25,800
If I'm as business business manager,

5478
02:31:25,801 --> 02:31:27,360
I'm saying you wait for the title shot,

5479
02:31:27,720 --> 02:31:28,171
you've won.

5480
02:31:28,171 --> 02:31:28,441
What?

5481
02:31:28,441 --> 02:31:30,640
Six in a row and you're getting nicer too.

5482
02:31:30,670 --> 02:31:33,630
You'd be one of those shady managers
that they fucking get on the underground

5483
02:31:33,631 --> 02:31:34,140
and say,

5484
02:31:34,140 --> 02:31:34,621
fuck,

5485
02:31:34,621 --> 02:31:35,431
Brendan's should die.

5486
02:31:35,431 --> 02:31:36,264
You don't want me to just,

5487
02:31:37,800 --> 02:31:39,420
you don't want me to manage dudes.

5488
02:31:40,010 --> 02:31:40,711
You don't want me.

5489
02:31:40,711 --> 02:31:43,200
And how many managers
stories have you heard?

5490
02:31:43,201 --> 02:31:47,370
I can manager after manager
aftermath with a Tz don't fight bro.

5491
02:31:47,371 --> 02:31:48,204
Wait,

5492
02:31:48,240 --> 02:31:48,781
wait man.

5493
02:31:48,781 --> 02:31:49,860
You've done all this work.

5494
02:31:50,040 --> 02:31:51,450
We're in a great opportunity.

5495
02:31:51,451 --> 02:31:52,440
You're going to get a title shot.

5496
02:31:52,441 --> 02:31:53,274
Let's wait.

5497
02:31:53,400 --> 02:31:54,233
Don't fight.

5498
02:31:54,330 --> 02:31:57,240
It might have to wait a long time though.

5499
02:31:57,241 --> 02:31:59,070
Habib's ahead of him in line.

5500
02:31:59,280 --> 02:32:00,113
You know,

5501
02:32:00,780 --> 02:32:02,430
there's a lot of fights out there.

5502
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:04,240
I mean he might have to wait a while.

5503
02:32:04,920 --> 02:32:05,700
You wait.

5504
02:32:05,700 --> 02:32:06,301
Title shots.

5505
02:32:06,301 --> 02:32:08,890
Think about how hard is to
get a towel chat one people,

5506
02:32:10,570 --> 02:32:12,450
are they denying fights?

5507
02:32:13,330 --> 02:32:15,120
Vitara that happens every now and then.

5508
02:32:15,121 --> 02:32:17,210
But generally Dana white offers a fighter.

5509
02:32:17,220 --> 02:32:18,450
Joe Silva and you fucking just,

5510
02:32:18,500 --> 02:32:20,700
it your Donald Cerrone and you're fucking,

5511
02:32:20,701 --> 02:32:22,950
I mean him and Dana Command,

5512
02:32:22,980 --> 02:32:24,630
he could command fights or fucking,

5513
02:32:24,631 --> 02:32:25,640
it's like stepbrothers.

5514
02:32:25,650 --> 02:32:25,791
You don't,

5515
02:32:25,791 --> 02:32:26,820
it's like they're boys.

5516
02:32:26,821 --> 02:32:27,031
Yeah.

5517
02:32:27,031 --> 02:32:28,560
So I'm sure he can be like,

5518
02:32:28,620 --> 02:32:30,300
and think how much he fought for him.

5519
02:32:30,570 --> 02:32:32,130
He thought Ben on a fucking,

5520
02:32:32,131 --> 02:32:32,371
what,

5521
02:32:32,371 --> 02:32:32,711
two week?

5522
02:32:32,711 --> 02:32:36,810
Three week notice you're fucking hanging
out with and you win seven in a row.

5523
02:32:36,930 --> 02:32:37,940
You wouldn't second row.

5524
02:32:38,120 --> 02:32:38,610
Yeah,

5525
02:32:38,610 --> 02:32:41,310
we'll cowboy wants to fight a lot.

5526
02:32:41,311 --> 02:32:43,510
I think he feels more
comfortable when he fights a lot.

5527
02:32:43,840 --> 02:32:45,270
He gets better when he fights a lot.

5528
02:32:45,620 --> 02:32:47,520
I did not go with that advice.

5529
02:32:47,820 --> 02:32:48,653
I wouldn't know.

5530
02:32:48,710 --> 02:32:52,550
No for immediate title shot
if he was in live for it.

5531
02:32:52,551 --> 02:32:53,430
Immediate title shot,

5532
02:32:53,431 --> 02:32:54,900
I would say that's good advice.

5533
02:32:55,020 --> 02:32:55,621
Wait it out.

5534
02:32:55,621 --> 02:32:56,340
But he's not.

5535
02:32:56,340 --> 02:32:57,600
There's other guys that had of him,

5536
02:32:57,750 --> 02:32:58,890
this shit could take a year.

5537
02:32:59,010 --> 02:33:00,990
Look what a pedes hurts himself again.

5538
02:33:01,140 --> 02:33:01,471
Okay.

5539
02:33:01,471 --> 02:33:02,850
Pedes hurt himself with Gilbert.

5540
02:33:03,060 --> 02:33:04,110
A lot of people were saying,

5541
02:33:04,710 --> 02:33:06,060
but that interim fights,

5542
02:33:06,061 --> 02:33:06,894
no good man.

5543
02:33:07,020 --> 02:33:08,050
But when Pedis,

5544
02:33:08,070 --> 02:33:09,900
champ pedis hurt himself,

5545
02:33:09,901 --> 02:33:11,310
how to get to go through surgery,

5546
02:33:11,370 --> 02:33:14,520
he's got through at least two surgeries
and there was rumor that he hurt his

5547
02:33:14,521 --> 02:33:16,380
hand or something after the,

5548
02:33:16,381 --> 02:33:16,711
the,

5549
02:33:16,711 --> 02:33:16,921
uh,

5550
02:33:16,921 --> 02:33:19,260
the fight with Gil and it
turned out that wasn't true.

5551
02:33:19,261 --> 02:33:20,400
Or if it was hurt,

5552
02:33:20,401 --> 02:33:21,480
it was okay.

5553
02:33:21,570 --> 02:33:23,310
He could rest it and it'll be fine.

5554
02:33:23,311 --> 02:33:25,410
But anything could happen.

5555
02:33:25,411 --> 02:33:26,850
Look at the fucking heavyweight division.

5556
02:33:26,880 --> 02:33:29,760
They had to have an interim title because
at a certain point in time it's like

5557
02:33:29,940 --> 02:33:31,050
canes gone through another service.

5558
02:33:31,050 --> 02:33:32,460
I like Jesus fucking Christ.

5559
02:33:32,880 --> 02:33:35,820
And when you can't wait
around for a title shot,

5560
02:33:35,821 --> 02:33:39,270
if that's a situation cause you can go
dry as cowboy fight so much better when

5561
02:33:39,271 --> 02:33:39,751
he's active.

5562
02:33:39,751 --> 02:33:40,470
I think it's good.

5563
02:33:40,470 --> 02:33:40,861
It's good.

5564
02:33:40,861 --> 02:33:41,521
General Advice,

5565
02:33:41,521 --> 02:33:42,420
I think what you're saying,

5566
02:33:42,421 --> 02:33:45,190
but like cowboy foot so much
better in his head is locked.

5567
02:33:45,240 --> 02:33:46,430
Like his head is in,

5568
02:33:46,550 --> 02:33:47,820
in to the lot better.

5569
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:50,030
I just don't want to
see if fight could be,

5570
02:33:50,300 --> 02:33:51,001
the thing is he,

5571
02:33:51,001 --> 02:33:54,390
so he takes off six months or
whatever it is and he comes back,

5572
02:33:54,450 --> 02:33:55,890
he's not going to get a tune up fight.

5573
02:33:56,100 --> 02:33:58,260
He's going to fight somebody
that's a fucking savage.

5574
02:33:58,680 --> 02:34:01,230
It's almost better for him
to stay in the fucking woods,

5575
02:34:01,290 --> 02:34:01,890
you know,

5576
02:34:01,890 --> 02:34:02,311
almost.

5577
02:34:02,311 --> 02:34:02,520
Yeah.

5578
02:34:02,520 --> 02:34:02,901
I just,

5579
02:34:02,901 --> 02:34:03,160
I,

5580
02:34:03,160 --> 02:34:05,640
I just think it's bad or good.

5581
02:34:06,870 --> 02:34:08,390
It's good to stay in act to stay.

5582
02:34:09,340 --> 02:34:09,771
I think,

5583
02:34:09,771 --> 02:34:10,110
uh,

5584
02:34:10,110 --> 02:34:10,860
first of all,

5585
02:34:10,860 --> 02:34:12,600
a guy like Norma Madoff is,

5586
02:34:12,650 --> 02:34:13,070
uh,

5587
02:34:13,070 --> 02:34:18,070
an elite grappler and it'll show
you where cowboys defenses and

5588
02:34:18,070 --> 02:34:19,390
where his back game is.

5589
02:34:19,391 --> 02:34:22,390
Cause Cowboy has a very nasty
triangle that people forget about God.

5590
02:34:22,420 --> 02:34:23,680
He's got a nasty game,

5591
02:34:23,860 --> 02:34:26,740
was badly super finished
with very nasty off his back.

5592
02:34:26,741 --> 02:34:27,071
So,

5593
02:34:27,071 --> 02:34:27,271
uh,

5594
02:34:27,271 --> 02:34:30,620
I wouldn't say that he couldn't beat
Namaka met off and if he did beat normally

5595
02:34:30,630 --> 02:34:31,180
come out off,

5596
02:34:31,180 --> 02:34:33,670
especially if you fucking showed
his versatility by submitting them.

5597
02:34:33,850 --> 02:34:34,001
I mean,

5598
02:34:34,001 --> 02:34:35,770
you would think if cowboy is going to win,

5599
02:34:35,920 --> 02:34:38,230
like most people would say
probably by knock out right?

5600
02:34:38,260 --> 02:34:39,160
Like normal gum it off,

5601
02:34:39,161 --> 02:34:39,580
hand up.

5602
02:34:39,580 --> 02:34:40,110
Yeah.

5603
02:34:40,110 --> 02:34:41,200
He'd had kicked him or something.

5604
02:34:41,201 --> 02:34:41,530
Yeah.

5605
02:34:41,530 --> 02:34:42,341
But man,

5606
02:34:42,341 --> 02:34:43,780
if he caught him with
something on the ground,

5607
02:34:43,781 --> 02:34:43,991
man,

5608
02:34:43,991 --> 02:34:45,910
that would be even more
impressive in my opinion.

5609
02:34:45,911 --> 02:34:49,690
Me Catch him in his own realm when
they're a Madoff is the elite grappler.

5610
02:34:49,930 --> 02:34:52,120
Whether he could do that or not is a big,

5611
02:34:52,150 --> 02:34:55,450
if you know like a guy like nick
or Madoff's 50 doing combat,

5612
02:34:55,451 --> 02:35:00,451
sambo combat sambo world champion and
you watch him fight dos Anjos it's pretty

5613
02:35:01,421 --> 02:35:06,421
obvious his grappling his on some next
level shit cause he just took that dude

5614
02:35:06,791 --> 02:35:07,360
to the ground.

5615
02:35:07,360 --> 02:35:12,280
Anytime you want it to rag Dalton
zoom or pounded on his face,

5616
02:35:12,310 --> 02:35:15,290
elbowed him and he'd be design
Joe Sanchez beat Donald.

5617
02:35:16,800 --> 02:35:18,570
Any beat Ben as well.

5618
02:35:18,840 --> 02:35:19,960
Like a Conor McGregor.

5619
02:35:19,961 --> 02:35:21,820
He's not fighting these elite grapplers.

5620
02:35:21,850 --> 02:35:22,480
Yeah.

5621
02:35:22,480 --> 02:35:25,740
So why does cowboy I
have to fight this boy.

5622
02:35:25,780 --> 02:35:27,030
I think he's the one that too.

5623
02:35:27,040 --> 02:35:29,050
I think he wants to and if he wins,

5624
02:35:29,051 --> 02:35:30,190
God damn dude.

5625
02:35:30,370 --> 02:35:31,270
If he wins,

5626
02:35:31,271 --> 02:35:31,840
I mean think about it.

5627
02:35:31,840 --> 02:35:34,180
He took the Benson fight
with two weeks notice.

5628
02:35:34,470 --> 02:35:36,040
A lot of people think he didn't win.

5629
02:35:36,190 --> 02:35:37,510
It was a very close,

5630
02:35:37,511 --> 02:35:38,650
controversial decision.

5631
02:35:38,651 --> 02:35:41,140
I thought personally I thought
Henderson was going to get the nod.

5632
02:35:41,350 --> 02:35:42,670
I didn't rewatch the fights.

5633
02:35:42,671 --> 02:35:43,031
I didn't,

5634
02:35:43,031 --> 02:35:44,880
I'm not committed to that.

5635
02:35:44,881 --> 02:35:45,671
I'm not married to that.

5636
02:35:45,671 --> 02:35:46,420
But I thought like,

5637
02:35:46,420 --> 02:35:48,040
I think Benson was more effective.

5638
02:35:48,041 --> 02:35:48,880
He did more shit,

5639
02:35:49,100 --> 02:35:52,540
got more things off and I knew cowboy was
pretty banged up going into that fight

5640
02:35:52,541 --> 02:35:52,990
too,

5641
02:35:52,990 --> 02:35:54,520
especially if the way
it was kicking miles,

5642
02:35:54,521 --> 02:35:55,740
juries legs when he was taboo.

5643
02:35:55,740 --> 02:35:56,710
I didn't look good in that.

5644
02:35:56,711 --> 02:35:57,610
But yeah,

5645
02:35:57,611 --> 02:36:00,400
he looked like a guy who
just fought two weeks ago.

5646
02:36:00,460 --> 02:36:00,890
You know what I mean?

5647
02:36:00,890 --> 02:36:01,721
You still look good,

5648
02:36:01,721 --> 02:36:04,960
but it took a head kicked in
and fucking played it off.

5649
02:36:04,990 --> 02:36:06,970
He got head kicked at
one point in time by,

5650
02:36:07,330 --> 02:36:10,540
by Ben and played it off well like
you could see him stiffen up though.

5651
02:36:10,541 --> 02:36:11,320
Like he got,

5652
02:36:11,320 --> 02:36:12,160
he got wrong.

5653
02:36:13,150 --> 02:36:13,990
It's tough man.

5654
02:36:14,020 --> 02:36:15,460
You fight and then you fight.

5655
02:36:15,461 --> 02:36:17,980
Two weeks later you're
going to be busted up.

5656
02:36:18,010 --> 02:36:18,540
But she couldn't,

5657
02:36:18,540 --> 02:36:19,460
that weight there,

5658
02:36:19,550 --> 02:36:23,020
there has to be some sort of point of
no return where your body's just like,

5659
02:36:23,021 --> 02:36:23,231
dude,

5660
02:36:23,231 --> 02:36:24,080
we can't keep doing this.

5661
02:36:24,100 --> 02:36:25,010
But then you see the show.

5662
02:36:25,020 --> 02:36:28,120
So you look at Nirimba Madoff and
he's been out for a long time.

5663
02:36:28,180 --> 02:36:32,380
He's had a knee surgery and then I
think he fucked something up again.

5664
02:36:32,380 --> 02:36:32,591
Like,

5665
02:36:32,591 --> 02:36:34,150
I think he hurt his knee and then,

5666
02:36:34,190 --> 02:36:36,640
and then retrained too quick
or something like that.

5667
02:36:36,760 --> 02:36:38,170
He's been out for a long time,

5668
02:36:38,410 --> 02:36:41,610
so he's trying to get back
on the men because they,

5669
02:36:41,770 --> 02:36:43,660
the reason why they gave
gill the title shot,

5670
02:36:43,661 --> 02:36:43,901
I mean,

5671
02:36:43,901 --> 02:36:45,550
I think Gil was supposed
to get the title shot,

5672
02:36:45,551 --> 02:36:49,350
but they were going to have Norma Madoff
was in the mix and they tried to offer

5673
02:36:49,351 --> 02:36:49,991
him a big fight,

5674
02:36:49,991 --> 02:36:52,090
but he couldn't take it
because his name was fucked up.

5675
02:36:52,270 --> 02:36:53,860
And that was like about six months ago.

5676
02:36:53,920 --> 02:36:55,420
I forget what fight he couldn't take,

5677
02:36:55,780 --> 02:36:56,081
but,

5678
02:36:56,081 --> 02:36:58,990
so he's been out for awhile too.

5679
02:36:59,050 --> 02:37:01,600
So it's not a bad time
for cowboy to catch him,

5680
02:37:01,810 --> 02:37:02,021
you know,

5681
02:37:02,021 --> 02:37:04,340
if you want it to look to you going to
catch up if you're going to catch them,

5682
02:37:04,341 --> 02:37:05,174
it's not a bad time.

5683
02:37:05,230 --> 02:37:06,460
Or they both Greg Jackson,

5684
02:37:07,210 --> 02:37:09,760
they both trained no

5685
02:37:12,080 --> 02:37:12,490
roofs.

5686
02:37:12,490 --> 02:37:14,590
Tom Hobby love these jobs.

5687
02:37:15,710 --> 02:37:16,880
A lot of those crazy Russians

5688
02:37:18,450 --> 02:37:20,150
and a Benson beet root.

5689
02:37:20,151 --> 02:37:21,130
Some hobby love.

5690
02:37:21,170 --> 02:37:22,003
Yeah.

5691
02:37:22,010 --> 02:37:22,481
So that,

5692
02:37:22,481 --> 02:37:23,630
that was a big win for him.

5693
02:37:24,020 --> 02:37:26,140
That fucking lightweight division
is filled with murderers,

5694
02:37:26,150 --> 02:37:26,480
man.

5695
02:37:26,480 --> 02:37:27,041
Just murder.

5696
02:37:27,041 --> 02:37:27,330
Murder.

5697
02:37:27,330 --> 02:37:28,163
Oh man,

5698
02:37:28,300 --> 02:37:29,760
so many audios.

5699
02:37:29,890 --> 02:37:32,360
They got a really good
shot of beating Padis.

5700
02:37:32,950 --> 02:37:33,180
Well,

5701
02:37:33,180 --> 02:37:33,640
you know,

5702
02:37:33,640 --> 02:37:34,430
got the best shot.

5703
02:37:34,430 --> 02:37:34,970
He's got a,

5704
02:37:34,970 --> 02:37:36,680
he's got a strong grappling game.

5705
02:37:36,681 --> 02:37:37,730
He's very physically strong.

5706
02:37:37,731 --> 02:37:38,564
He looked at Nate,

5707
02:37:38,750 --> 02:37:39,710
Nate Diaz fight.

5708
02:37:39,890 --> 02:37:41,330
His grappling game is very strong.

5709
02:37:41,480 --> 02:37:42,800
He's very fucking big.

5710
02:37:42,830 --> 02:37:43,700
He's very fit.

5711
02:37:43,850 --> 02:37:45,870
His leg kicks her nasty shit.

5712
02:37:45,890 --> 02:37:46,520
Kickboxing.

5713
02:37:46,520 --> 02:37:46,731
Yeah.

5714
02:37:46,731 --> 02:37:48,290
So it's like he's not a,

5715
02:37:48,320 --> 02:37:49,100
uh,

5716
02:37:49,100 --> 02:37:50,690
like an easy out on the feet.

5717
02:37:50,750 --> 02:37:51,583
It's not like,

5718
02:37:51,740 --> 02:37:52,220
you know,

5719
02:37:52,220 --> 02:37:53,810
pedis could just light
them up on the feet.

5720
02:37:54,320 --> 02:37:54,651
You know?

5721
02:37:54,651 --> 02:37:56,620
I think it's just a strong too,

5722
02:37:56,950 --> 02:37:58,250
I think it's to be on the feet.

5723
02:37:58,251 --> 02:38:00,020
It'd be interesting to
see if pedis can get off.

5724
02:38:00,050 --> 02:38:04,020
Pedis is definitely quicker and it's
definitely more experienced against world

5725
02:38:04,021 --> 02:38:05,750
class competition and being successful.

5726
02:38:05,960 --> 02:38:06,141
I mean,

5727
02:38:06,141 --> 02:38:08,030
pedis knocked out cowboy,

5728
02:38:08,240 --> 02:38:08,601
you know,

5729
02:38:08,601 --> 02:38:08,930
I mean,

5730
02:38:08,930 --> 02:38:09,740
pedis is,

5731
02:38:09,740 --> 02:38:10,760
he's something special.

5732
02:38:10,761 --> 02:38:11,594
He really is.

5733
02:38:12,060 --> 02:38:13,280
But at the South Pole,

5734
02:38:13,310 --> 02:38:14,143
it's going to be interesting.

5735
02:38:16,400 --> 02:38:19,280
It's going to be really hard for
anybody to stand with Pettis.

5736
02:38:19,490 --> 02:38:20,300
Yes.

5737
02:38:20,300 --> 02:38:21,350
He's too scary.

5738
02:38:22,100 --> 02:38:25,370
He doesn't get hit so hard with all this,

5739
02:38:25,580 --> 02:38:26,930
the unorthodox stuff.

5740
02:38:26,931 --> 02:38:27,141
I mean,

5741
02:38:27,141 --> 02:38:28,130
he has the craziest kick.

5742
02:38:28,131 --> 02:38:30,080
Love to see Conor Aldo do it.

5743
02:38:31,220 --> 02:38:31,671
Yeah.

5744
02:38:31,671 --> 02:38:32,391
I wanted to see,

5745
02:38:32,391 --> 02:38:34,520
although versus Pettis and they
were trying to set that up.

5746
02:38:34,580 --> 02:38:34,921
Where are you?

5747
02:38:34,921 --> 02:38:35,601
And let me tell you something.

5748
02:38:35,601 --> 02:38:37,460
Pedes was ready to go down to one 45.

5749
02:38:37,490 --> 02:38:38,420
He doesn't give a fuck.

5750
02:38:38,421 --> 02:38:38,631
He's like,

5751
02:38:38,631 --> 02:38:39,530
I want to fight that dude.

5752
02:38:40,020 --> 02:38:40,251
He goes,

5753
02:38:40,251 --> 02:38:41,540
I think I can beat that motherfucker.

5754
02:38:41,600 --> 02:38:42,470
That's when he hurt his knee.

5755
02:38:42,471 --> 02:38:42,760
Right?

5756
02:38:42,760 --> 02:38:43,260
Yeah.

5757
02:38:43,260 --> 02:38:45,710
Imagine pennys going to remember
they were setting that up.

5758
02:38:45,740 --> 02:38:49,010
They were setting up that Superfight
pet is going down to one 45 and fighting

5759
02:38:49,020 --> 02:38:50,570
Aldo would be fucking crazy.

5760
02:38:50,720 --> 02:38:53,330
Looking at those two guys
facing off against each other.

5761
02:38:53,690 --> 02:38:55,040
That would be insane.

5762
02:38:55,190 --> 02:38:57,980
The Funny Eric Silva break him down.

5763
02:38:58,610 --> 02:38:59,950
Eric Silva is a,

5764
02:38:59,960 --> 02:39:01,520
a very aggressive dude.

5765
02:39:01,760 --> 02:39:03,380
He's a very tough guy.

5766
02:39:03,560 --> 02:39:05,330
Like you look at his
fight with Matt Brown.

5767
02:39:05,480 --> 02:39:05,981
He,

5768
02:39:05,981 --> 02:39:10,981
he's a a ferocious dude for like the
first round or so round two rounds.

5769
02:39:11,690 --> 02:39:13,970
I've never seen him do like,

5770
02:39:14,030 --> 02:39:14,420
uh,

5771
02:39:14,420 --> 02:39:17,280
like a normal combat bed
off type fight or uh,

5772
02:39:17,930 --> 02:39:19,010
dos Anjos fight.

5773
02:39:19,011 --> 02:39:23,480
I just don't sign just the way he ground
down Nate Diaz for three rounds get

5774
02:39:23,481 --> 02:39:23,751
dumped.

5775
02:39:23,751 --> 02:39:24,800
Took her down and smashed him,

5776
02:39:24,950 --> 02:39:26,750
constantly work and constantly working.

5777
02:39:27,080 --> 02:39:27,980
Eric Silva,

5778
02:39:28,310 --> 02:39:30,170
I think especially earlier in his career,

5779
02:39:30,230 --> 02:39:31,790
it tended to run out of gas,

5780
02:39:31,820 --> 02:39:33,440
like John Fitch outfits to them.

5781
02:39:33,680 --> 02:39:37,190
John Fitch just kind of took them down
Malden and stayed on him and warm out.

5782
02:39:37,250 --> 02:39:38,330
He's just got worn out.

5783
02:39:38,450 --> 02:39:40,250
He's not the same guy
towards the end of the fight.

5784
02:39:40,520 --> 02:39:41,360
And Matt Brown,

5785
02:39:41,361 --> 02:39:42,011
that's Matt Brown,

5786
02:39:42,011 --> 02:39:42,844
his world,

5787
02:39:42,860 --> 02:39:43,161
you know,

5788
02:39:43,161 --> 02:39:43,451
he's,

5789
02:39:43,451 --> 02:39:44,720
he's in a drown in bitches.

5790
02:39:44,960 --> 02:39:46,610
Matt Brown drowns motherfuckers.

5791
02:39:46,670 --> 02:39:47,503
That's what he does,

5792
02:39:47,750 --> 02:39:48,201
you know,

5793
02:39:48,201 --> 02:39:49,670
and Eric heard him,

5794
02:39:49,820 --> 02:39:51,140
he heard him in the first round.

5795
02:39:51,260 --> 02:39:52,850
He hit him with a nasty body kick.

5796
02:39:52,851 --> 02:39:54,740
He's got a real good
left kick to the liver.

5797
02:39:55,010 --> 02:39:58,250
He throws that kick and throw it like
a front kick to throw it that way too.

5798
02:39:58,490 --> 02:40:00,370
He's really good with his,

5799
02:40:00,390 --> 02:40:02,840
his distance was kicks
is super aggressive.

5800
02:40:02,990 --> 02:40:03,711
His ground game,

5801
02:40:03,711 --> 02:40:04,550
his real solid,

5802
02:40:04,700 --> 02:40:05,420
but he's just,

5803
02:40:05,420 --> 02:40:05,670
he,

5804
02:40:05,670 --> 02:40:09,760
he to me it's like he's
emotional or something or it too,

5805
02:40:09,790 --> 02:40:11,210
too much adrenaline or something,

5806
02:40:11,330 --> 02:40:13,010
but it doesn't seem to hold a,

5807
02:40:13,350 --> 02:40:14,310
that he could sustain.

5808
02:40:14,550 --> 02:40:16,380
And if you get in there
with a guy like Matt Brown,

5809
02:40:16,381 --> 02:40:19,350
like you gotta know when
to lay off the gas man,

5810
02:40:19,520 --> 02:40:21,040
you got to know when to recruit.

5811
02:40:21,090 --> 02:40:22,680
You got to know what
kind of shape you're in.

5812
02:40:22,860 --> 02:40:23,970
And Matt Brown,

5813
02:40:24,240 --> 02:40:24,391
Look,

5814
02:40:24,391 --> 02:40:27,280
Matt Brown exposes people
he did to Wonderboy.

5815
02:40:27,300 --> 02:40:28,500
He exposed Wonderboy,

5816
02:40:28,620 --> 02:40:28,950
not,

5817
02:40:28,950 --> 02:40:31,000
I'm not saying this in a
negative way towards Wonderboy.

5818
02:40:31,080 --> 02:40:31,970
I think Wonderboy,

5819
02:40:32,280 --> 02:40:33,690
what was exposed in that fight,

5820
02:40:33,691 --> 02:40:37,350
according to my conversation with one
voice that he overtrained he said just he

5821
02:40:37,351 --> 02:40:40,980
was really trying to deal with the
cardio and the shift that Matt Brown was

5822
02:40:40,981 --> 02:40:41,380
thrown out on.

5823
02:40:41,380 --> 02:40:44,220
But he said he might overdid it
cause he was just like real flat.

5824
02:40:44,370 --> 02:40:45,091
And then you know,

5825
02:40:45,091 --> 02:40:45,780
Matt,

5826
02:40:45,780 --> 02:40:46,320
you can't,

5827
02:40:46,320 --> 02:40:48,690
you can't have an off day when
you're fighting Matt Brown rice guys.

5828
02:40:48,691 --> 02:40:48,931
Right?

5829
02:40:48,931 --> 02:40:49,920
His pace breaks.

5830
02:40:49,940 --> 02:40:52,320
Dude's [inaudible] Silva.

5831
02:40:52,470 --> 02:40:54,010
I think Matt eventually broke them.

5832
02:40:54,880 --> 02:40:55,080
Oh,

5833
02:40:55,080 --> 02:40:55,861
is this just like,

5834
02:40:55,861 --> 02:40:56,694
what the fuck?

5835
02:40:56,700 --> 02:40:58,200
He's not saying it's ferocious.

5836
02:40:58,201 --> 02:40:59,430
Round is going to be a beast.

5837
02:40:59,460 --> 02:41:00,293
He's not laying off.

5838
02:41:02,510 --> 02:41:03,343
Got My book,

5839
02:41:03,540 --> 02:41:04,321
I got my boy killed.

5840
02:41:04,321 --> 02:41:06,260
It'd be all day canceled.

5841
02:41:07,830 --> 02:41:09,420
So unusual,

5842
02:41:09,540 --> 02:41:09,811
you know,

5843
02:41:09,811 --> 02:41:13,220
and the more you concentrate on
training with this motherfucker,

5844
02:41:13,230 --> 02:41:14,190
you're to me or like,

5845
02:41:14,480 --> 02:41:16,500
like I've been waiting
for someone to come along,

5846
02:41:16,520 --> 02:41:18,270
I'll others outside of Aoki,

5847
02:41:18,271 --> 02:41:18,831
but of course I,

5848
02:41:18,831 --> 02:41:19,030
okay.

5849
02:41:19,030 --> 02:41:21,180
You always have those crazy
tights on and it's like,

5850
02:41:21,210 --> 02:41:21,441
it's,

5851
02:41:21,441 --> 02:41:26,441
it's so hard to find someone in MMA that
understands that guard correctly and to

5852
02:41:27,211 --> 02:41:29,160
be able to have the kind of flexibility,

5853
02:41:29,161 --> 02:41:30,930
dexterity you have in rap guys up,

5854
02:41:31,080 --> 02:41:32,670
you're going to see
you get into positions.

5855
02:41:32,671 --> 02:41:35,330
Like Jason Day was when he fought um,

5856
02:41:35,440 --> 02:41:36,273
uh,

5857
02:41:37,050 --> 02:41:38,760
Alan Belcher in Canada.

5858
02:41:38,910 --> 02:41:42,590
He wrapped him up in that mission
control and drop some bows on it,

5859
02:41:42,591 --> 02:41:42,990
man.

5860
02:41:42,990 --> 02:41:45,180
And you realize like if someone
is good at this position,

5861
02:41:45,360 --> 02:41:47,490
you leave someone incredibly vulnerable,

5862
02:41:48,060 --> 02:41:49,080
incredibly vulnerable.

5863
02:41:49,180 --> 02:41:51,930
It's just that position is there all day.

5864
02:41:52,110 --> 02:41:56,400
The position to lock up arm's mission
control in order to get to like a good

5865
02:41:56,401 --> 02:42:00,930
place of completely controlling a guy
in a way that you rarely see and closed

5866
02:42:00,931 --> 02:42:01,530
guard.

5867
02:42:01,530 --> 02:42:01,861
It's,

5868
02:42:01,861 --> 02:42:04,260
the technique is around in grappling.

5869
02:42:04,440 --> 02:42:05,730
I mean you see it in grappling,

5870
02:42:05,880 --> 02:42:07,320
but in MMA it's,

5871
02:42:07,350 --> 02:42:08,190
it's fairly,

5872
02:42:08,550 --> 02:42:09,870
and it's not because it doesn't work,

5873
02:42:10,050 --> 02:42:11,670
but to me it's like wheel kicks.

5874
02:42:11,671 --> 02:42:14,400
Like for the longest time we just didn't
see him and everybody didn't think they

5875
02:42:14,401 --> 02:42:15,060
work.

5876
02:42:15,060 --> 02:42:19,710
And then Barbosa lands that
fucking nuclear weapon on
Terry Edom and everybody's

5877
02:42:19,711 --> 02:42:20,544
spinning now.

5878
02:42:20,580 --> 02:42:21,413
Veit tours,

5879
02:42:21,430 --> 02:42:22,263
winning,

5880
02:42:22,410 --> 02:42:22,861
spinning,

5881
02:42:22,861 --> 02:42:23,610
heel kicks,

5882
02:42:23,610 --> 02:42:24,121
knocks out.

5883
02:42:24,121 --> 02:42:26,640
Luke Rockhold was a
fucking spinning junior.

5884
02:42:26,641 --> 02:42:28,320
Dos Santos hits Mark Hunt with it.

5885
02:42:28,350 --> 02:42:29,183
I mean it's,

5886
02:42:29,280 --> 02:42:33,180
I think that once someone sees what a
guy like you is capable off of his back,

5887
02:42:33,181 --> 02:42:37,980
it opens up so much defensive
possibilities and so much
authentic possibilities

5888
02:42:37,981 --> 02:42:38,490
too.

5889
02:42:38,490 --> 02:42:42,690
Like your way safer defensively and you're
all fence off your back in positions

5890
02:42:42,691 --> 02:42:44,520
that people don't think
they're vulnerable for.

5891
02:42:45,030 --> 02:42:45,251
You know,

5892
02:42:45,251 --> 02:42:47,700
like I get what he puts her fucking
hands on the mat in the UFC.

5893
02:42:47,720 --> 02:42:48,170
Everyone,

5894
02:42:48,170 --> 02:42:49,003
everyone does.

5895
02:42:49,050 --> 02:42:49,883
Everyone does.

5896
02:42:49,890 --> 02:42:52,650
You put your hands on the mat at his
school and you're going to have an elbow

5897
02:42:52,651 --> 02:42:53,080
problem.

5898
02:42:53,080 --> 02:42:56,540
Do you do your scanning of your shit
snapped or you're going to get snapped?

5899
02:42:57,030 --> 02:42:58,440
He was in cold Miller's corner.

5900
02:42:58,580 --> 02:42:58,711
Oh,

5901
02:42:58,711 --> 02:42:59,220
okay.

5902
02:42:59,220 --> 02:42:59,461
Yeah,

5903
02:42:59,461 --> 02:43:00,840
he's a no,

5904
02:43:00,841 --> 02:43:05,841
Gucci is a great thing
about Ben is that I get,

5905
02:43:07,110 --> 02:43:09,480
I've had so many MMA
fighters come through and,

5906
02:43:09,550 --> 02:43:09,870
and,

5907
02:43:09,870 --> 02:43:10,703
and uh,

5908
02:43:11,250 --> 02:43:12,083
I

5909
02:43:12,160 --> 02:43:17,160
try to add the rubber guard or
other techniques to their MMA game.

5910
02:43:19,510 --> 02:43:20,343
Um,

5911
02:43:20,440 --> 02:43:25,090
and sometimes some more to come and
they're striking will be really bad.

5912
02:43:25,091 --> 02:43:26,530
They got really good Jiu Jitsu.

5913
02:43:26,531 --> 02:43:27,670
They want to do MMA.

5914
02:43:28,060 --> 02:43:29,980
They just started striking six months ago.

5915
02:43:29,981 --> 02:43:31,480
They want to add rubber
guard and I'm like,

5916
02:43:31,481 --> 02:43:32,200
okay,

5917
02:43:32,200 --> 02:43:33,670
we're going to add rubber guard of a man.

5918
02:43:33,671 --> 02:43:36,220
Like you got along way
to go with your striking,

5919
02:43:36,340 --> 02:43:36,851
you know,

5920
02:43:36,851 --> 02:43:39,880
or a guy will come from
a wrestling background.

5921
02:43:39,881 --> 02:43:40,750
Really good wrestler.

5922
02:43:40,870 --> 02:43:43,660
Not that good striking
just started Jujitsu.

5923
02:43:43,690 --> 02:43:44,261
He wants to do,

5924
02:43:44,261 --> 02:43:45,050
I'm in May.

5925
02:43:45,050 --> 02:43:46,300
We got a lot to work.

5926
02:43:46,301 --> 02:43:46,511
Oh,

5927
02:43:46,511 --> 02:43:47,181
we got to work on it.

5928
02:43:47,181 --> 02:43:50,230
A lot of other Jujitsu than Robert go
and I'm just going to work on rubber

5929
02:43:50,231 --> 02:43:50,501
guard.

5930
02:43:50,501 --> 02:43:52,030
We've got to get your passing together.

5931
02:43:52,200 --> 02:43:54,130
We got to get your guard
retention together.

5932
02:43:54,340 --> 02:43:56,710
We got to get so much
other stuff together.

5933
02:43:57,090 --> 02:43:58,390
Like this is a longterm project,

5934
02:43:58,630 --> 02:43:59,020
but there's,

5935
02:43:59,020 --> 02:43:59,681
they're awesome.

5936
02:43:59,681 --> 02:44:00,910
They're awesome people.

5937
02:44:01,170 --> 02:44:01,421
Yeah,

5938
02:44:01,421 --> 02:44:02,254
they're awesome people.

5939
02:44:02,350 --> 02:44:06,610
And then sometimes you have a tremendous
striker coming to me and that I want to

5940
02:44:06,611 --> 02:44:07,480
learn some rubber guard.

5941
02:44:07,630 --> 02:44:11,500
Mike has zero wrestling and as
you Jitsu his blue belt level,

5942
02:44:11,620 --> 02:44:12,490
and the same with them,

5943
02:44:12,640 --> 02:44:13,720
you have tremendous striking.

5944
02:44:13,721 --> 02:44:14,590
That's awesome.

5945
02:44:15,040 --> 02:44:15,581
But man,

5946
02:44:15,581 --> 02:44:18,340
Dude's gonna try to take you down and
you've got to have garner attention

5947
02:44:18,341 --> 02:44:19,174
skills.

5948
02:44:19,260 --> 02:44:24,190
You got to have so much other pieces
of the game that it's not just rubber

5949
02:44:24,191 --> 02:44:24,431
guard.

5950
02:44:24,431 --> 02:44:26,530
So it's a lot of things
that you've got to work on.

5951
02:44:26,860 --> 02:44:28,030
But when Ben came to me,

5952
02:44:28,420 --> 02:44:31,210
he came to me with UFC experience.

5953
02:44:31,720 --> 02:44:34,840
He came to me as a black
belt from Ricardo laboriel.

5954
02:44:34,841 --> 02:44:37,000
So I don't have to really
work on anything else,

5955
02:44:37,001 --> 02:44:38,650
but just really,

5956
02:44:38,680 --> 02:44:39,513
and he's,

5957
02:44:39,550 --> 02:44:42,130
he got tremendously
long legs for his size.

5958
02:44:42,130 --> 02:44:42,491
He's six,

5959
02:44:42,491 --> 02:44:42,910
three,

5960
02:44:42,910 --> 02:44:43,211
six,

5961
02:44:43,211 --> 02:44:43,361
two,

5962
02:44:43,361 --> 02:44:43,601
six,

5963
02:44:43,601 --> 02:44:45,610
three but he's got the
legs of the dude that six,

5964
02:44:45,611 --> 02:44:47,470
eight and they're super flexible.

5965
02:44:47,890 --> 02:44:49,190
He's super flex weed and,

5966
02:44:49,220 --> 02:44:50,440
and a lot of guys that come to me,

5967
02:44:51,040 --> 02:44:51,461
they're ready,

5968
02:44:51,461 --> 02:44:52,151
they're ready to find,

5969
02:44:52,151 --> 02:44:52,691
they're doing pretty good,

5970
02:44:52,691 --> 02:44:53,950
but they don't have the flexibility.

5971
02:44:53,951 --> 02:44:55,200
We got to get the flexibility again,

5972
02:44:55,360 --> 02:44:56,500
that could take a year,

5973
02:44:56,600 --> 02:44:57,520
that could take two years,

5974
02:44:57,580 --> 02:44:58,450
that could take three years,

5975
02:44:58,510 --> 02:45:01,870
that could take two months depending on
how much time they're willing to put in

5976
02:45:02,050 --> 02:45:02,920
to their flexibility.

5977
02:45:03,100 --> 02:45:04,020
So would it be,

5978
02:45:04,270 --> 02:45:07,020
Ben came to me already a
black belt from MacArthur.

5979
02:45:07,030 --> 02:45:10,710
Laborio already had his
flexibility already was playing uh,

5980
02:45:11,010 --> 02:45:11,570
uh,

5981
02:45:11,570 --> 02:45:12,070
uh,

5982
02:45:12,070 --> 02:45:13,330
versions of the rubber guard.

5983
02:45:13,331 --> 02:45:15,850
He was already bringing
his legs up on and,

5984
02:45:16,270 --> 02:45:18,970
and he's an amazing striker.

5985
02:45:19,120 --> 02:45:20,140
Jesus Christ.

5986
02:45:20,290 --> 02:45:20,771
It's really,

5987
02:45:20,771 --> 02:45:21,910
it's really easy for me.

5988
02:45:21,920 --> 02:45:23,890
Like he wants to stand up.

5989
02:45:23,920 --> 02:45:25,300
He don't even want to
take it to the ground,

5990
02:45:25,301 --> 02:45:30,301
but it just seems like at least his last
two opponents in the UFC wanted to take

5991
02:45:30,401 --> 02:45:31,030
him down.

5992
02:45:31,030 --> 02:45:31,650
Uh,

5993
02:45:31,650 --> 02:45:32,471
w what was his name?

5994
02:45:32,471 --> 02:45:33,304
Seth Heatherly.

5995
02:45:33,460 --> 02:45:34,293
Chris Heatherly.

5996
02:45:34,600 --> 02:45:34,811
Chris,

5997
02:45:34,811 --> 02:45:35,980
he wanted to take you down.

5998
02:45:36,070 --> 02:45:38,050
He saw your tape when
you look at the tape.

5999
02:45:38,230 --> 02:45:39,190
And to be honest with you,

6000
02:45:40,390 --> 02:45:41,710
I'm so buried,

6001
02:45:42,030 --> 02:45:42,863
had been buried,

6002
02:45:42,940 --> 02:45:44,350
which just life,

6003
02:45:44,440 --> 02:45:48,400
the last few years I haven't
kept up with MMA like I want to,

6004
02:45:48,401 --> 02:45:49,270
I just don't have the time.

6005
02:45:49,480 --> 02:45:49,961
And I kind of,

6006
02:45:49,961 --> 02:45:54,010
and I never watched Beltre
when Ben went to Bella tour,

6007
02:45:54,190 --> 02:45:55,540
I kind of lost track.

6008
02:45:55,600 --> 02:45:56,890
I saw one or two fights.

6009
02:45:57,100 --> 02:45:57,970
I lost track.

6010
02:45:58,030 --> 02:45:58,863
Jesus.

6011
02:45:59,200 --> 02:46:02,200
So be kick you just through what happened.

6012
02:46:02,230 --> 02:46:06,230
He's a hell of warm and not to just
through a wicked fucking around Casper.

6013
02:46:06,270 --> 02:46:06,910
So anyways,

6014
02:46:06,910 --> 02:46:09,220
he says in the Serena,

6015
02:46:09,980 --> 02:46:11,390
all this fight coming up,

6016
02:46:11,720 --> 02:46:12,920
all his fights were in this arena.

6017
02:46:12,921 --> 02:46:15,050
This is what I'll say about anything else.

6018
02:46:15,051 --> 02:46:16,490
It's wrap it up before we get real quick.

6019
02:46:16,491 --> 02:46:17,241
I just wanted to finish.

6020
02:46:17,241 --> 02:46:18,980
What I was saying about Ben is,

6021
02:46:19,200 --> 02:46:20,033
um,

6022
02:46:20,660 --> 02:46:23,460
he came to me and I really didn't
know how good of a striker he was.

6023
02:46:23,790 --> 02:46:24,591
Hit not the letter,

6024
02:46:24,591 --> 02:46:26,330
I'm just the one that
came up to me and said,

6025
02:46:26,620 --> 02:46:26,890
do you,

6026
02:46:26,890 --> 02:46:27,640
have you seen?

6027
02:46:27,640 --> 02:46:28,130
And you know,

6028
02:46:28,130 --> 02:46:28,950
what do you know about a strike?

6029
02:46:28,950 --> 02:46:29,601
I know he's pretty good.

6030
02:46:29,601 --> 02:46:30,291
He's got good knees,

6031
02:46:30,291 --> 02:46:30,650
right?

6032
02:46:30,650 --> 02:46:31,940
I remember like the killer knees.

6033
02:46:32,150 --> 02:46:32,451
He goes,

6034
02:46:32,451 --> 02:46:32,721
dude,

6035
02:46:32,721 --> 02:46:34,220
go watch him on Youtube.

6036
02:46:34,221 --> 02:46:36,860
This guy is fucking super killer.

6037
02:46:37,130 --> 02:46:40,700
So I went and I watched the highlight
reel of Ben Saunders and when you watch a

6038
02:46:40,701 --> 02:46:41,270
highlight reel,

6039
02:46:41,270 --> 02:46:41,450
like,

6040
02:46:41,450 --> 02:46:42,283
oh shit,

6041
02:46:42,410 --> 02:46:46,610
it's a highlight reel of
him fucking starching dudes
and fucking him up with all

6042
02:46:46,611 --> 02:46:47,310
sorts of shit.

6043
02:46:47,310 --> 02:46:49,010
Jimmy's head kicks,

6044
02:46:49,280 --> 02:46:50,120
spinning back,

6045
02:46:50,121 --> 02:46:50,450
fist,

6046
02:46:50,450 --> 02:46:51,180
elbows,

6047
02:46:51,180 --> 02:46:52,490
boom man.

6048
02:46:52,491 --> 02:46:52,821
It's,

6049
02:46:52,821 --> 02:46:53,540
it's uh,

6050
02:46:53,540 --> 02:46:55,880
it makes it easier to
teach someone when they,

6051
02:46:55,940 --> 02:46:56,540
they're,

6052
02:46:56,540 --> 02:46:58,850
they're already coming as
a killer teen killer bee.

6053
02:46:58,940 --> 02:46:59,773
What do you think,

6054
02:47:00,600 --> 02:47:03,860
what do you think Benson Henderson is
Wayne right now as he gets into the

6055
02:47:03,861 --> 02:47:04,580
octagon?

6056
02:47:04,580 --> 02:47:05,930
Like how much do you think he was cutting?

6057
02:47:06,080 --> 02:47:07,370
What do you think he
probably weighs right now?

6058
02:47:07,400 --> 02:47:08,270
One 75.

6059
02:47:08,271 --> 02:47:12,590
180170170 one.

6060
02:47:13,110 --> 02:47:13,440
Well,

6061
02:47:13,440 --> 02:47:16,100
so you think that that's all he weighed
before he started his cut down to one

6062
02:47:16,101 --> 02:47:16,934
55.

6063
02:47:17,190 --> 02:47:19,460
One seven one which is not
much bigger than just spot.

6064
02:47:19,850 --> 02:47:20,690
It's hard to put that.

6065
02:47:20,700 --> 02:47:25,250
He just bought a Brandon's thatches head
coach leaser bowling wrestle in college

6066
02:47:25,251 --> 02:47:27,800
with Ben Henderson and
they're super close.

6067
02:47:28,010 --> 02:47:28,640
And he,

6068
02:47:28,640 --> 02:47:29,451
that's what he was saying.

6069
02:47:29,451 --> 02:47:30,380
The advantages,

6070
02:47:30,530 --> 02:47:32,330
Ben walks around at may one 70,

6071
02:47:32,331 --> 02:47:33,140
barely.

6072
02:47:33,140 --> 02:47:36,650
And we know that on a strict diet lean is,

6073
02:47:36,651 --> 02:47:37,160
fuck,

6074
02:47:37,160 --> 02:47:40,970
we'll enter the octagon tonight
at one 90 which is crazy,

6075
02:47:40,971 --> 02:47:41,390
man.

6076
02:47:41,390 --> 02:47:42,080
Wow.

6077
02:47:42,080 --> 02:47:43,760
So it was a big difference in the size.

6078
02:47:44,090 --> 02:47:45,050
So you're talking about,

6079
02:47:45,051 --> 02:47:47,180
we're probably looking at
a 15 pound plus difference.

6080
02:47:47,390 --> 02:47:48,680
There's your board Joe rigs,

6081
02:47:49,940 --> 02:47:50,601
15 pounds.

6082
02:47:50,601 --> 02:47:51,950
And you're talking about a dude who,

6083
02:47:52,040 --> 02:47:55,680
who's a Kale artists too
at one 70 that's a shit.

6084
02:47:55,690 --> 02:47:56,110
Looks the,

6085
02:47:56,110 --> 02:47:57,030
and he doesn't look good.

6086
02:47:57,080 --> 02:47:58,160
Grappling is different,

6087
02:47:58,550 --> 02:48:00,110
but grappling will be the difference.

6088
02:48:00,140 --> 02:48:01,040
What I was gonna say is his,

6089
02:48:01,041 --> 02:48:04,880
he ever fought somebody at this level
has Benson is at a very high level.

6090
02:48:04,910 --> 02:48:05,390
I agree.

6091
02:48:05,390 --> 02:48:05,601
No,

6092
02:48:05,601 --> 02:48:06,434
he has it.

6093
02:48:06,440 --> 02:48:09,020
This is like the biggest
Paulo Thiago in Brazil.

6094
02:48:09,170 --> 02:48:09,771
Yeah.

6095
02:48:09,771 --> 02:48:10,161
But Paul,

6096
02:48:10,161 --> 02:48:12,410
Tiago is nowhere as good
as Benson Henderson is.

6097
02:48:12,500 --> 02:48:12,900
I know.

6098
02:48:12,900 --> 02:48:13,733
All due respect,

6099
02:48:13,760 --> 02:48:14,890
the highest level he's fought.

6100
02:48:14,940 --> 02:48:17,330
And it was in Brazil against him.

6101
02:48:17,530 --> 02:48:19,190
You mean supplement wise?

6102
02:48:19,730 --> 02:48:20,563
Yes.

6103
02:48:20,720 --> 02:48:22,680
I love it.

6104
02:48:22,681 --> 02:48:23,514
He said yes.

6105
02:48:23,870 --> 02:48:24,650
Just kidding.

6106
02:48:24,650 --> 02:48:26,180
Well I wonder how many guys,

6107
02:48:26,181 --> 02:48:26,630
man,

6108
02:48:26,630 --> 02:48:29,630
how many guys did get the fucking
free pass from the doctor,

6109
02:48:29,720 --> 02:48:30,230
my friend.

6110
02:48:30,230 --> 02:48:31,370
Don't worry about this.

6111
02:48:31,940 --> 02:48:33,950
I got the right your and
for you and this one,

6112
02:48:36,080 --> 02:48:39,860
I mean it had to have happened somewhere
along the line in some country where a

6113
02:48:39,861 --> 02:48:42,590
local guy got a free pass,

6114
02:48:42,680 --> 02:48:43,940
a drug test.

6115
02:48:44,740 --> 02:48:46,100
That would be a giant scandal.

6116
02:48:46,280 --> 02:48:49,850
If we found out that someone in the
athletic commission and some place was

6117
02:48:49,851 --> 02:48:53,150
involved and doping
someone like helping some,

6118
02:48:53,450 --> 02:48:56,630
some fucking Super Geronimo type dude,

6119
02:48:56,631 --> 02:48:56,751
you know,

6120
02:48:56,751 --> 02:48:58,580
it's crazy and we want surprise me.

6121
02:48:58,840 --> 02:48:59,480
Damn.

6122
02:48:59,480 --> 02:49:00,450
It wouldn't surprise me.

6123
02:49:00,470 --> 02:49:01,110
Surprise me.

6124
02:49:01,110 --> 02:49:05,030
There's some more surprises about Bruce
Jenner turned to a chick straight up

6125
02:49:05,450 --> 02:49:06,730
that surprise the shit out of it.

6126
02:49:06,731 --> 02:49:07,564
It was

6127
02:49:08,400 --> 02:49:09,120
shocking.

6128
02:49:09,120 --> 02:49:09,400
I go,

6129
02:49:09,400 --> 02:49:10,910
I want to go back to the podcast.

6130
02:49:10,920 --> 02:49:13,710
When were ragging on calendar
about it and listen to it.

6131
02:49:13,711 --> 02:49:14,470
Olympian.

6132
02:49:14,470 --> 02:49:15,140
It's a limb.

6133
02:49:15,140 --> 02:49:15,973
We'll the best Olympians.

6134
02:49:16,010 --> 02:49:16,843
Everest.

6135
02:49:17,150 --> 02:49:19,050
Is he the first cornflakes
box or something like

6136
02:49:21,080 --> 02:49:21,913
corn flakes?

6137
02:49:23,310 --> 02:49:23,911
Bruce Buffer.

6138
02:49:23,911 --> 02:49:24,780
More airtime.

6139
02:49:25,350 --> 02:49:29,130
He's doing all this cool shit right
now that you have any last UFC.

6140
02:49:29,280 --> 02:49:29,880
Well,

6141
02:49:29,880 --> 02:49:31,500
people were more into what he does now.

6142
02:49:31,501 --> 02:49:32,340
Like even the,

6143
02:49:32,341 --> 02:49:32,431
uh,

6144
02:49:32,431 --> 02:49:34,110
the UFC appreciates it now.

6145
02:49:34,320 --> 02:49:37,830
Like these wacky moves they used to
be embarrassed by his whiskey moves.

6146
02:49:39,390 --> 02:49:43,590
Isn't it true that Eddie Bravo gave him
the idea and the inspiration for the

6147
02:49:43,591 --> 02:49:43,861
buffer?

6148
02:49:43,861 --> 02:49:44,960
Three 60 no,

6149
02:49:44,970 --> 02:49:45,151
no,

6150
02:49:45,151 --> 02:49:45,331
no,

6151
02:49:45,331 --> 02:49:45,451
no,

6152
02:49:45,451 --> 02:49:45,621
no.

6153
02:49:45,621 --> 02:49:46,680
I was not the buffer.

6154
02:49:46,740 --> 02:49:47,573
The Matrix,

6155
02:49:48,540 --> 02:49:50,160
the matrix buffer was a different one.

6156
02:49:50,161 --> 02:49:51,450
He never ran with it.

6157
02:49:51,540 --> 02:49:52,590
It was too hard though.

6158
02:49:52,600 --> 02:49:55,370
The three 60 it was too hard
cause there was one way we wait.

6159
02:49:55,380 --> 02:49:56,191
Don't say it was too hard.

6160
02:49:56,191 --> 02:50:00,090
Say the fans when he phones weren't
ready for this move where instead of just

6161
02:50:00,091 --> 02:50:01,680
going like that are spinning
and going like that.

6162
02:50:01,830 --> 02:50:03,060
Like him going like this,

6163
02:50:03,810 --> 02:50:06,720
keeping icon coming through like that.

6164
02:50:06,750 --> 02:50:07,380
I like that.

6165
02:50:07,380 --> 02:50:08,140
I can't even do it.

6166
02:50:08,140 --> 02:50:08,941
You have to practice.

6167
02:50:08,941 --> 02:50:10,050
But the idea is like,

6168
02:50:11,250 --> 02:50:11,800
like that.

6169
02:50:11,800 --> 02:50:12,220
Oh yeah.

6170
02:50:12,220 --> 02:50:14,930
He didn't want to do you gotta
have some good back flexibility

6171
02:50:17,930 --> 02:50:21,330
right there and keep an eye contact,

6172
02:50:21,390 --> 02:50:22,410
keep eye contact,

6173
02:50:22,411 --> 02:50:23,220
anything like that.

6174
02:50:23,220 --> 02:50:24,540
And Joe,

6175
02:50:24,570 --> 02:50:24,781
Joe,

6176
02:50:24,781 --> 02:50:25,614
you know,

6177
02:50:26,380 --> 02:50:26,910
let's say,

6178
02:50:26,910 --> 02:50:28,290
let's say thatch knocks him out.

6179
02:50:28,291 --> 02:50:32,250
What to do for that because she
really fiber puts them on the map.

6180
02:50:32,270 --> 02:50:32,941
Put them on the map,

6181
02:50:32,941 --> 02:50:33,181
right?

6182
02:50:33,181 --> 02:50:33,360
Yeah.

6183
02:50:33,360 --> 02:50:34,100
Cause such a big,

6184
02:50:34,100 --> 02:50:34,670
big way,

6185
02:50:34,670 --> 02:50:36,330
but in one 70 does it,

6186
02:50:36,331 --> 02:50:37,280
does it make a statement?

6187
02:50:37,330 --> 02:50:38,550
One 70 yes,

6188
02:50:38,700 --> 02:50:39,360
because he did,

6189
02:50:39,360 --> 02:50:41,130
he talked about doing one 70 before.

6190
02:50:41,130 --> 02:50:42,060
Everybody knows is a big one.

6191
02:50:42,061 --> 02:50:44,460
55 or he's a world champion.

6192
02:50:44,700 --> 02:50:47,640
I mean Benson Henderson
is legit world champion,

6193
02:50:47,641 --> 02:50:48,480
class fighter,

6194
02:50:48,870 --> 02:50:49,770
UFC champion.

6195
02:50:49,771 --> 02:50:52,260
I mean he's stepping up to 70 for sure.

6196
02:50:52,261 --> 02:50:53,190
But for thatch,

6197
02:50:53,370 --> 02:50:56,730
that's a giant wind and for
Benson is to let everybody know,

6198
02:50:56,820 --> 02:50:57,211
hey,

6199
02:50:57,211 --> 02:50:57,660
you know,

6200
02:50:57,660 --> 02:51:02,660
I can fuck some people up
at one 72 including really
dangerous unheralded young

6201
02:51:03,001 --> 02:51:04,950
guys that no one wants to fight.

6202
02:51:05,190 --> 02:51:06,023
And that's that.

6203
02:51:06,310 --> 02:51:09,210
There's a lot of dudes that
do not want to fight that guy.

6204
02:51:09,720 --> 02:51:10,530
You know?

6205
02:51:10,530 --> 02:51:11,880
I know a couple of guys turned the fight,

6206
02:51:14,570 --> 02:51:15,670
that big motherfucker.

6207
02:51:17,360 --> 02:51:19,490
He's a beast.

6208
02:51:19,620 --> 02:51:20,270
He's,

6209
02:51:20,270 --> 02:51:20,580
yeah,

6210
02:51:20,580 --> 02:51:21,750
he's a thick dude.

6211
02:51:21,980 --> 02:51:22,920
This is going to be a hard fight.

6212
02:51:22,950 --> 02:51:23,671
Athletic too,

6213
02:51:23,671 --> 02:51:24,150
man.

6214
02:51:24,150 --> 02:51:24,611
Grappling.

6215
02:51:24,611 --> 02:51:29,100
Zoe's been is his Achilles heel and you
can tell like eastern doubt in his mind,

6216
02:51:29,101 --> 02:51:31,010
Ma'am leasters have been
working on with them.

6217
02:51:31,120 --> 02:51:32,730
I like a mother fucker mother.

6218
02:51:32,731 --> 02:51:33,780
At least he knows his shit,

6219
02:51:33,781 --> 02:51:34,310
man.

6220
02:51:34,310 --> 02:51:36,030
He used to no sleeping
in the wrestling room.

6221
02:51:36,340 --> 02:51:36,960
Least at Boeing's.

6222
02:51:36,960 --> 02:51:37,690
No struggle.

6223
02:51:37,690 --> 02:51:37,921
Yeah.

6224
02:51:37,921 --> 02:51:39,100
In Elliot Marshall helping him,

6225
02:51:39,630 --> 02:51:44,630
he would go for 54 if you want
to keep up with us a bit away.

6226
02:51:47,310 --> 02:51:48,143
Hello.

6227
02:51:48,320 --> 02:51:48,840
That's just,

6228
02:51:48,840 --> 02:51:50,390
that's just a superstar in Denver.

6229
02:51:50,391 --> 02:51:51,100
Two men.

6230
02:51:51,100 --> 02:51:54,500
You saw the billboards that Cami
is here to walking him down.

6231
02:51:54,530 --> 02:51:55,610
Cleared size difference.

6232
02:51:59,490 --> 02:52:00,281
I love Ben though,

6233
02:52:00,281 --> 02:52:01,090
man.

6234
02:52:01,090 --> 02:52:04,330
That's his real confident
God switching stances.

6235
02:52:05,170 --> 02:52:06,130
Making a mess.

6236
02:52:06,430 --> 02:52:06,680
Well,

6237
02:52:06,680 --> 02:52:08,830
Benson's got to get some
respect here for sure.

6238
02:52:09,220 --> 02:52:14,220
He's got a tag him with something that
gives him at least some concern because I

6239
02:52:15,401 --> 02:52:15,611
want,

6240
02:52:15,611 --> 02:52:17,560
if he shoots though thatches knees,

6241
02:52:17,561 --> 02:52:18,080
man,

6242
02:52:18,080 --> 02:52:19,360
they're legendary in Denver.

6243
02:52:19,960 --> 02:52:20,793
Really?

6244
02:52:21,280 --> 02:52:24,050
Damn you could already see is kind of,

6245
02:52:25,120 --> 02:52:26,710
he's just waiting for
him to shoot his knee.

6246
02:52:26,711 --> 02:52:28,240
His fucking nasty.

6247
02:52:29,590 --> 02:52:30,423
You're chewing.

6248
02:52:30,450 --> 02:52:30,780
I'm like,

6249
02:52:30,780 --> 02:52:31,420
Oh shit.

6250
02:52:31,420 --> 02:52:32,253
I'm sorry.

6251
02:52:33,720 --> 02:52:34,610
Last chip

6252
02:52:37,120 --> 02:52:38,920
shot by then you have that.

6253
02:52:39,850 --> 02:52:40,683
You weren't really loud.

6254
02:52:46,250 --> 02:52:47,230
Oh my God.

6255
02:52:47,650 --> 02:52:47,801
Yeah.

6256
02:52:47,801 --> 02:52:50,200
This is to be in the clench
with that either man.

6257
02:52:50,650 --> 02:52:50,891
Dude,

6258
02:52:50,891 --> 02:52:53,140
this fucking kid stand up is good.

6259
02:52:53,560 --> 02:52:54,640
Nice set up there.

6260
02:52:54,730 --> 02:52:55,181
I like it.

6261
02:52:55,181 --> 02:52:57,790
I think with the right to
set up distance for the left,

6262
02:52:57,791 --> 02:52:58,870
he's super creative.

6263
02:52:58,871 --> 02:52:59,704
Men.

6264
02:53:00,340 --> 02:53:01,173
Look at that.

6265
02:53:01,360 --> 02:53:02,780
Benson throws that Hook.

6266
02:53:02,781 --> 02:53:04,940
You got the last guy who
I saw as creative as that.

6267
02:53:04,950 --> 02:53:05,920
Just the Cup Swanson.

6268
02:53:06,220 --> 02:53:06,760
Is that right?

6269
02:53:06,760 --> 02:53:07,240
Yup.

6270
02:53:07,240 --> 02:53:08,073
That's amazing.

6271
02:53:08,200 --> 02:53:11,270
And you said that he's been trained by
his dad since he was a little kid since,

6272
02:53:11,290 --> 02:53:11,480
yeah,

6273
02:53:11,480 --> 02:53:12,430
since he's in diapers,

6274
02:53:12,431 --> 02:53:12,581
man.

6275
02:53:12,581 --> 02:53:13,414
That's cool.

6276
02:53:13,570 --> 02:53:14,780
He used to come in the gym and we,

6277
02:53:14,790 --> 02:53:18,190
we literally just watch them
just destroy cats with knees,

6278
02:53:18,280 --> 02:53:19,750
south Paul Rec,

6279
02:53:19,751 --> 02:53:20,710
traditional stance,

6280
02:53:20,720 --> 02:53:24,220
whatever you want to like how he
switches back and forth effortlessly.

6281
02:53:24,221 --> 02:53:24,550
Yup.

6282
02:53:24,550 --> 02:53:25,690
He's got that nice check.

6283
02:53:25,691 --> 02:53:27,190
They're two real key switches.

6284
02:53:27,220 --> 02:53:27,701
F Ooh,

6285
02:53:27,701 --> 02:53:27,971
Nice.

6286
02:53:27,971 --> 02:53:28,840
Right hand to the body.

6287
02:53:28,841 --> 02:53:33,490
But the body shot by Benson Henderson
is back and he's chasing him down.

6288
02:53:34,840 --> 02:53:35,381
But listen,

6289
02:53:35,381 --> 02:53:36,370
the longer this goes,

6290
02:53:36,371 --> 02:53:37,360
the better it is for Ben.

6291
02:53:37,390 --> 02:53:38,710
That's his biggest fun.

6292
02:53:38,740 --> 02:53:39,760
Oh,

6293
02:53:39,790 --> 02:53:41,020
big kick to the body.

6294
02:53:41,230 --> 02:53:42,280
This is not looking good.

6295
02:53:42,290 --> 02:53:43,570
And over the top bike dad,

6296
02:53:43,600 --> 02:53:46,270
God damn these look like they're
not looking good for Henderson,

6297
02:53:46,271 --> 02:53:47,050
man.

6298
02:53:47,050 --> 02:53:48,520
You remember to thatch,

6299
02:53:48,550 --> 02:53:49,091
like I said,

6300
02:53:49,091 --> 02:53:51,910
he's fighting this arena
eight or nine times.

6301
02:53:51,911 --> 02:53:52,780
He's the main event.

6302
02:53:52,810 --> 02:53:53,680
Pretty uncomfortable.

6303
02:53:53,860 --> 02:53:54,770
He's used to being,

6304
02:53:54,790 --> 02:53:55,060
you know,

6305
02:53:55,060 --> 02:53:56,050
the star attraction.

6306
02:53:56,170 --> 02:53:57,340
So what you're saying is

6307
02:54:00,060 --> 02:54:00,893
he nervous?

6308
02:54:03,010 --> 02:54:04,210
Has Nasty elbows.

6309
02:54:04,211 --> 02:54:05,044
Two minutes.

6310
02:54:07,290 --> 02:54:08,820
Oh damn hard.

6311
02:54:08,821 --> 02:54:13,560
Inside leg kick check by Henderson Dude.

6312
02:54:13,561 --> 02:54:14,460
He's big.

6313
02:54:14,490 --> 02:54:14,851
Oh,

6314
02:54:14,851 --> 02:54:15,211
nice.

6315
02:54:15,211 --> 02:54:17,100
Front kick by Henderson
and knock them down.

6316
02:54:17,900 --> 02:54:20,190
It doesn't hurt them but
it keeps them honest.

6317
02:54:20,760 --> 02:54:21,770
Get off your back

6318
02:54:24,590 --> 02:54:25,423
southpaw

6319
02:54:26,670 --> 02:54:28,190
did he hits hard.

6320
02:54:28,450 --> 02:54:29,201
You could see it.

6321
02:54:29,201 --> 02:54:31,270
It's very fluid with his kicks man.

6322
02:54:31,390 --> 02:54:32,930
See how he's switching traditional sound?

6323
02:54:32,931 --> 02:54:34,000
Both nasty.

6324
02:54:34,030 --> 02:54:34,863
Yeah.

6325
02:54:35,010 --> 02:54:36,610
Superfluid man.

6326
02:54:38,740 --> 02:54:39,573
Oh,

6327
02:54:40,100 --> 02:54:40,191
oh,

6328
02:54:40,191 --> 02:54:41,210
he's trying to set up a kick.

6329
02:54:41,240 --> 02:54:41,421
Yeah,

6330
02:54:41,421 --> 02:54:41,700
I'll see.

6331
02:54:41,700 --> 02:54:42,620
I was dropping his hands.

6332
02:54:43,520 --> 02:54:46,510
Stand sideways looking
for this being my friend.

6333
02:54:49,070 --> 02:54:49,940
If I'm Ben's coach,

6334
02:54:49,941 --> 02:54:52,280
I'm saying getting against
the cage and and wear him out,

6335
02:54:52,281 --> 02:54:52,460
man.

6336
02:54:52,460 --> 02:54:53,900
Give them to the third and fourth down.

6337
02:54:56,120 --> 02:54:56,953
He sat in some money.

6338
02:54:57,140 --> 02:54:57,620
He's like,

6339
02:54:57,620 --> 02:54:57,921
he like,

6340
02:54:57,921 --> 02:54:59,300
he sat in a spin up.

6341
02:54:59,360 --> 02:54:59,541
Yeah,

6342
02:54:59,541 --> 02:55:00,820
it looks keep sending up was spinning.

6343
02:55:01,460 --> 02:55:05,330
He keeps doing it like he keeps leading
with that laugh when he gets that left

6344
02:55:05,331 --> 02:55:05,930
forward.

6345
02:55:05,930 --> 02:55:07,610
He's looking to spin with his right side,

6346
02:55:08,030 --> 02:55:10,370
but he just isn't pulling the trigger
on is thinking about it too much.

6347
02:55:10,371 --> 02:55:11,560
That's a nice inside like her.

6348
02:55:17,670 --> 02:55:18,810
I like that body shop.

6349
02:55:18,811 --> 02:55:19,470
Benson,

6350
02:55:19,470 --> 02:55:20,303
his land

6351
02:55:22,860 --> 02:55:24,030
just so much stronger.

6352
02:55:25,530 --> 02:55:26,220
Damn.

6353
02:55:26,220 --> 02:55:28,140
That's where five minutes is a long time.

6354
02:55:28,710 --> 02:55:29,670
This kind of scrap.

6355
02:55:29,730 --> 02:55:29,971
Ooh,

6356
02:55:29,971 --> 02:55:31,440
nice body kick by Henderson.

6357
02:55:32,690 --> 02:55:35,150
That's what I'm insurgency thatch
and the third and fourth round.

6358
02:55:35,180 --> 02:55:36,013
Oh

6359
02:55:36,140 --> 02:55:36,973
sorry

6360
02:55:39,610 --> 02:55:39,851
dude.

6361
02:55:39,851 --> 02:55:41,470
He's going after Benson

6362
02:55:43,400 --> 02:55:44,540
going after him,

6363
02:55:44,541 --> 02:55:45,140
man.

6364
02:55:45,140 --> 02:55:45,591
Oh,

6365
02:55:45,591 --> 02:55:46,424
Nice Jab.

6366
02:55:48,590 --> 02:55:49,423
Great Name.

6367
02:55:49,930 --> 02:55:50,690
Big kickup.

6368
02:55:50,690 --> 02:55:51,523
Hi.

6369
02:56:03,430 --> 02:56:04,263
Right.

6370
02:56:05,970 --> 02:56:06,540
Ooh,

6371
02:56:06,540 --> 02:56:07,373
Nice.

6372
02:56:07,830 --> 02:56:09,840
Nice Combo by Henderson Bait and switch.

6373
02:56:14,840 --> 02:56:15,080
God,

6374
02:56:15,080 --> 02:56:16,390
he's fast it cutting them off.

6375
02:56:16,500 --> 02:56:18,310
And that's just from a karate background.

6376
02:56:18,311 --> 02:56:21,010
You said background and
his main sparring partners.

6377
02:56:21,011 --> 02:56:21,800
Matt Brown.

6378
02:56:21,800 --> 02:56:22,220
Whoa.

6379
02:56:22,220 --> 02:56:22,631
Not Brown.

6380
02:56:22,631 --> 02:56:24,800
And Neil Magni are the guys
that rotate in and on him.

6381
02:56:25,390 --> 02:56:28,360
Matt Brown lives on his couch
when he does his camps in Denver.

6382
02:56:28,600 --> 02:56:29,320
No Shit.

6383
02:56:29,320 --> 02:56:30,153
Yep.

6384
02:56:30,220 --> 02:56:31,450
Matt Brown lives in Cleveland,

6385
02:56:31,451 --> 02:56:31,750
right?

6386
02:56:31,750 --> 02:56:32,021
Yeah.

6387
02:56:32,021 --> 02:56:33,160
Cincinnati or Cleveland,

6388
02:56:33,440 --> 02:56:35,090
I think since uh,

6389
02:56:35,130 --> 02:56:35,990
Cullompton addy,

6390
02:56:36,010 --> 02:56:36,843
Columbus.

6391
02:56:37,210 --> 02:56:37,631
Columbus,

6392
02:56:37,631 --> 02:56:37,991
Ohio,

6393
02:56:37,991 --> 02:56:38,360
right?

6394
02:56:38,360 --> 02:56:38,800
Yeah,

6395
02:56:38,800 --> 02:56:39,191
Columbus,

6396
02:56:39,191 --> 02:56:39,870
Ohio.

6397
02:56:39,870 --> 02:56:40,181
Cause he,

6398
02:56:40,181 --> 02:56:42,010
I know he trains at a west side barbell.

6399
02:56:42,070 --> 02:56:42,251
Yeah,

6400
02:56:42,251 --> 02:56:42,701
exactly.

6401
02:56:42,701 --> 02:56:43,890
Does that shirt that loose?

6402
02:56:44,260 --> 02:56:45,490
Those guys are bad ass.

6403
02:56:45,520 --> 02:56:47,350
I got one of those reverse
hypers in the back.

6404
02:56:47,470 --> 02:56:48,080
Oh sweet.

6405
02:56:48,080 --> 02:56:48,720
Too.

6406
02:56:48,720 --> 02:56:51,330
Did a seminar with the power that the
people with the strongest woman in the

6407
02:56:51,331 --> 02:56:52,680
world and her husband and shit.

6408
02:56:52,920 --> 02:56:54,300
And it's fucking phenomenal.

6409
02:56:54,330 --> 02:56:55,460
Like it's,

6410
02:56:55,461 --> 02:56:56,281
it's awesome shit.

6411
02:56:56,281 --> 02:56:56,511
And it,

6412
02:56:56,511 --> 02:56:59,460
and really it's something that all
fighters like as far as like when you see

6413
02:56:59,461 --> 02:57:02,490
guys lose knockout power dudes that you
used to have it starch and dudes and

6414
02:57:02,491 --> 02:57:03,031
then they don't,

6415
02:57:03,031 --> 02:57:03,810
and they're just like,

6416
02:57:03,810 --> 02:57:06,180
it's like they're just happened
dudes now I feel like their,

6417
02:57:06,240 --> 02:57:09,320
their training has been misused in a way.

6418
02:57:09,410 --> 02:57:09,961
Why is you're saying?

6419
02:57:09,961 --> 02:57:10,291
Yeah,

6420
02:57:10,291 --> 02:57:10,531
and they,

6421
02:57:10,531 --> 02:57:10,801
and they,

6422
02:57:10,801 --> 02:57:12,950
and they actually lose
that power because it's,

6423
02:57:13,120 --> 02:57:13,501
it's weird.

6424
02:57:13,501 --> 02:57:13,800
It's like,

6425
02:57:13,800 --> 02:57:14,250
it's like what,

6426
02:57:14,250 --> 02:57:15,510
Jujitsu is the same thing.

6427
02:57:15,511 --> 02:57:18,330
Like were we didn't see a lot of rubber
guard for a long time and now it's like

6428
02:57:18,331 --> 02:57:19,650
creeping in and all that kind of stuff.

6429
02:57:19,651 --> 02:57:20,484
But that's like,

6430
02:57:20,670 --> 02:57:25,350
there's a time in Emma in MMA
where there was nobody that was,

6431
02:57:25,740 --> 02:57:26,573
um,

6432
02:57:27,230 --> 02:57:28,160
it was pushing a guard game.

6433
02:57:28,170 --> 02:57:28,381
They're like,

6434
02:57:28,381 --> 02:57:29,130
stand up and,

6435
02:57:29,130 --> 02:57:30,000
and scrap again.

6436
02:57:30,001 --> 02:57:30,290
Right.

6437
02:57:30,290 --> 02:57:30,670
And the,

6438
02:57:30,670 --> 02:57:33,510
and that's because the coaches
didn't know any better.

6439
02:57:33,570 --> 02:57:37,530
And now like a lot of guys like Duane
Ludwig's or the world that are like actual

6440
02:57:37,531 --> 02:57:39,930
fighters that came out and now
they can put that together.

6441
02:57:40,170 --> 02:57:42,120
But that's changing the whole face of it,

6442
02:57:42,410 --> 02:57:43,151
I think.

6443
02:57:43,151 --> 02:57:43,451
You know.

6444
02:57:43,451 --> 02:57:45,580
So you mean like now we've seen
that with strength and conditioning.

6445
02:57:45,581 --> 02:57:47,470
So what you're saying now we're seeing
that with strength and conditioning as

6446
02:57:47,471 --> 02:57:47,620
well.

6447
02:57:47,620 --> 02:57:47,831
Yeah.

6448
02:57:47,831 --> 02:57:49,480
Well you never forget.

6449
02:57:49,481 --> 02:57:50,700
It's a bunch of people that don't know.

6450
02:57:50,720 --> 02:57:53,740
I hooked by Benson that
Marv Marinovich camps,

6451
02:57:53,741 --> 02:57:58,000
those Marmar Mark Marinovich camps at Bj
went through for the best performances

6452
02:57:58,001 --> 02:57:58,834
of his career.

6453
02:57:58,900 --> 02:57:59,200
You know,

6454
02:57:59,200 --> 02:58:00,160
he hated doing it,

6455
02:58:00,161 --> 02:58:00,701
but man,

6456
02:58:00,701 --> 02:58:02,700
watch Bj when he fucked Diego Sanchez,

6457
02:58:02,850 --> 02:58:04,570
he was a mother fucker.

6458
02:58:04,630 --> 02:58:05,110
Yeah,

6459
02:58:05,110 --> 02:58:05,420
sure.

6460
02:58:05,420 --> 02:58:06,001
See you right.

6461
02:58:06,001 --> 02:58:07,200
He was doing all that USC.

6462
02:58:07,230 --> 02:58:07,501
Yeah.

6463
02:58:07,501 --> 02:58:09,900
He was doing all kinds of crazy shit.

6464
02:58:09,901 --> 02:58:10,111
I mean,

6465
02:58:10,111 --> 02:58:11,610
there's videos of him working out.

6466
02:58:11,700 --> 02:58:13,110
He said he was so tired at night.

6467
02:58:13,111 --> 02:58:14,460
He couldn't even pick up his baby.

6468
02:58:14,880 --> 02:58:15,211
You know,

6469
02:58:15,211 --> 02:58:16,470
he said it was just exhausted,

6470
02:58:16,500 --> 02:58:17,340
but Ooh,

6471
02:58:17,370 --> 02:58:18,240
Benson caught him.

6472
02:58:19,140 --> 02:58:19,973
But the,

6473
02:58:20,010 --> 02:58:21,840
the result was incredible.

6474
02:58:21,870 --> 02:58:22,081
Oh,

6475
02:58:22,081 --> 02:58:22,914
looking for it.

6476
02:58:25,160 --> 02:58:26,220
The result was incredible.

6477
02:58:26,221 --> 02:58:26,461
I mean,

6478
02:58:26,461 --> 02:58:28,230
Bj in that kind of tip,

6479
02:58:28,231 --> 02:58:31,050
tip top condition is such a motherfucker.

6480
02:58:31,440 --> 02:58:33,540
Did you see the roots
will fight Bj documentary?

6481
02:58:33,600 --> 02:58:34,380
They send that to you?

6482
02:58:34,380 --> 02:58:34,621
Yeah,

6483
02:58:34,621 --> 02:58:35,454
they did.

6484
02:58:35,520 --> 02:58:36,480
I haven't watched it yet though,

6485
02:58:36,481 --> 02:58:37,350
but I heard it's amazing.

6486
02:58:37,351 --> 02:58:38,370
It's awesome that way.

6487
02:58:38,371 --> 02:58:39,420
You want to Bj Penn shirt,

6488
02:58:40,050 --> 02:58:41,010
will they send it to me?

6489
02:58:41,011 --> 02:58:45,000
But I just watched a documentary
yesterday that yesterday back to Bj is a

6490
02:58:45,001 --> 02:58:45,834
difference.

6491
02:58:46,960 --> 02:58:47,141
Yeah.

6492
02:58:47,141 --> 02:58:48,460
Bj was a beast man.

6493
02:58:48,940 --> 02:58:50,020
There's leaster bowling,

6494
02:58:50,410 --> 02:58:51,280
Christian Allen,

6495
02:58:52,080 --> 02:58:53,670
the masterminds behind Brandon Thatch.

6496
02:58:57,530 --> 02:58:58,430
Oh Nice.

6497
02:58:59,850 --> 02:59:01,830
Now do you think that's
just starting to slow down?

6498
02:59:01,980 --> 02:59:02,221
Yeah,

6499
02:59:02,221 --> 02:59:02,761
it looks like it,

6500
02:59:02,761 --> 02:59:03,120
doesn't it?

6501
02:59:03,120 --> 02:59:03,341
Yeah.

6502
02:59:03,341 --> 02:59:03,911
It's interesting.

6503
02:59:03,911 --> 02:59:05,550
A theft in the third and fourth round man.

6504
02:59:05,910 --> 02:59:06,510
Well that's,

6505
02:59:06,510 --> 02:59:06,721
well,

6506
02:59:06,721 --> 02:59:08,790
how about the fifth if he gets into that,

6507
02:59:08,791 --> 02:59:09,510
right.

6508
02:59:09,510 --> 02:59:12,360
But what is the knock on him
as far as his conditioning?

6509
02:59:12,690 --> 02:59:13,040
He's,

6510
02:59:13,040 --> 02:59:13,561
he's really,

6511
02:59:13,561 --> 02:59:15,240
it was knocking everyone
out in the first round.

6512
02:59:15,241 --> 02:59:16,200
So we really don't know.

6513
02:59:16,230 --> 02:59:16,531
I mean,

6514
02:59:16,531 --> 02:59:17,041
I'm training,

6515
02:59:17,041 --> 02:59:20,600
he's always been obese cause
as long as this is all standup,

6516
02:59:20,640 --> 02:59:24,150
he can do 10 rounds as if Ben
starts grappling with them.

6517
02:59:24,151 --> 02:59:26,490
I think Brandon's going
to be in some trouble.

6518
02:59:26,550 --> 02:59:29,280
Do you think maybe a
Benson might know that?

6519
02:59:29,281 --> 02:59:32,460
It might be like looking to stand with
them with the first couple of rounds and

6520
02:59:32,461 --> 02:59:34,200
then where I'm down to third,

6521
02:59:34,201 --> 02:59:36,930
fourth and fifth and then start taking
them down if you had a be in his corner.

6522
02:59:36,960 --> 02:59:37,171
Yeah,

6523
02:59:37,171 --> 02:59:38,700
that's exactly what I'd say to do.

6524
02:59:38,790 --> 02:59:40,110
Well the thing is is like I said,

6525
02:59:40,111 --> 02:59:43,230
at least her bowling is really good
friends with Ben and Ben's head coach

6526
02:59:43,260 --> 02:59:44,070
Crouch.

6527
02:59:44,070 --> 02:59:46,340
They just the like uh,

6528
02:59:46,410 --> 02:59:48,340
when co cowboy and Ben Flat.

6529
02:59:48,750 --> 02:59:50,730
Oh they just toss and he told him.

6530
02:59:50,731 --> 02:59:50,911
He goes,

6531
02:59:50,911 --> 02:59:51,061
yeah,

6532
02:59:51,061 --> 02:59:54,870
the best Gamer camp right now is Brandon
thatch and do any told them about him.

6533
02:59:55,050 --> 02:59:55,261
She's like,

6534
02:59:55,261 --> 02:59:57,600
he's this monster and the next thing
you know they're fighting each other.

6535
02:59:57,870 --> 02:59:58,081
Dude,

6536
02:59:58,081 --> 03:00:02,160
that switch the Oh spinning back kick
to the body that's switched than he does

6537
03:00:02,161 --> 03:00:02,941
where it makes it a little bit,

6538
03:00:02,941 --> 03:00:05,940
he's going to throw a right kick and
then he sets up the left or left kick and

6539
03:00:05,941 --> 03:00:06,774
he says it with the right.

6540
03:00:06,900 --> 03:00:08,250
That's some beautiful shit,

6541
03:00:08,251 --> 03:00:09,084
man.

6542
03:00:09,330 --> 03:00:13,080
That's something you only see in like
high level kickboxing most of the time.

6543
03:00:13,740 --> 03:00:15,840
Good job at that man.

6544
03:00:16,620 --> 03:00:17,011
Ooh,

6545
03:00:17,011 --> 03:00:18,690
Nice Jack gotta be waiting for it.

6546
03:00:18,930 --> 03:00:19,763
Right?

6547
03:00:20,130 --> 03:00:21,900
Or maybe just things to do is too big.

6548
03:00:21,930 --> 03:00:23,100
It doesn't want to fuck with that.

6549
03:00:23,430 --> 03:00:27,240
Oh that's a high level grappler wrestler.

6550
03:00:27,270 --> 03:00:29,130
That's a beautiful fucking jab.

6551
03:00:29,131 --> 03:00:30,630
Right hand or jab left hand.

6552
03:00:30,720 --> 03:00:32,370
But then Ben just went for a leg.

6553
03:00:32,820 --> 03:00:34,170
But that might be to keep them honest.

6554
03:00:34,171 --> 03:00:34,740
You know,

6555
03:00:34,740 --> 03:00:36,000
I think Ben needs a switch.

6556
03:00:36,001 --> 03:00:36,811
It up can get,

6557
03:00:36,811 --> 03:00:37,650
I'm guessing man.

6558
03:00:38,130 --> 03:00:39,830
Ben is thrown a lot of right hooks.

6559
03:00:39,850 --> 03:00:40,280
The body.

6560
03:00:40,280 --> 03:00:41,110
Oh yes.

6561
03:00:41,110 --> 03:00:42,490
Oh it was that.

6562
03:00:42,500 --> 03:00:44,190
Oh he loses his balance right there.

6563
03:00:44,440 --> 03:00:44,700
Nah,

6564
03:00:44,700 --> 03:00:45,310
it looks like right.

6565
03:00:45,310 --> 03:00:47,520
Then I'll come back and try
to press him on the fence.

6566
03:00:47,521 --> 03:00:49,200
If you could hold a little rock,

6567
03:00:49,201 --> 03:00:52,980
but his legs being pinned against
the fence by him would be death.

6568
03:00:55,070 --> 03:00:55,903
Ooh,

6569
03:00:56,030 --> 03:00:56,863
good body shots.

6570
03:00:57,080 --> 03:00:58,190
I bet he goes up top soon.

6571
03:01:01,160 --> 03:01:01,821
Good move.

6572
03:01:01,821 --> 03:01:03,950
I'm moving these main event
fights to five rounds.

6573
03:01:03,951 --> 03:01:04,784
Right?

6574
03:01:04,980 --> 03:01:06,590
He might have for the fighters.

6575
03:01:07,640 --> 03:01:11,720
So much more entertaining
used for the players in camp.

6576
03:01:11,920 --> 03:01:12,260
Yeah.

6577
03:01:12,260 --> 03:01:12,531
Ooh,

6578
03:01:12,531 --> 03:01:12,861
Nice.

6579
03:01:12,861 --> 03:01:13,670
Straight left.

6580
03:01:13,670 --> 03:01:16,040
It is a great to watch,

6581
03:01:16,070 --> 03:01:18,940
but you got to think they
can't like steep meo chicken.

6582
03:01:18,960 --> 03:01:19,310
Uh,

6583
03:01:19,310 --> 03:01:20,270
junior dos Santos.

6584
03:01:20,840 --> 03:01:22,580
Like how many of those can you do?

6585
03:01:24,920 --> 03:01:26,120
Oh Damn.

6586
03:01:27,350 --> 03:01:28,760
He needs to not stay down here though.

6587
03:01:28,940 --> 03:01:29,510
Wow.

6588
03:01:29,510 --> 03:01:30,880
He just tossed back.

6589
03:01:33,920 --> 03:01:34,400
What happened?

6590
03:01:34,400 --> 03:01:35,390
I poked their something.

6591
03:01:35,391 --> 03:01:36,830
Something happened maybe.

6592
03:01:36,960 --> 03:01:37,400
Wow.

6593
03:01:37,400 --> 03:01:38,181
I love that show.

6594
03:01:38,181 --> 03:01:39,560
Respect in the middle of combat.

6595
03:01:39,561 --> 03:01:40,490
Those guys just hugged.

6596
03:01:40,880 --> 03:01:42,140
No one's even talking about it.

6597
03:01:45,200 --> 03:01:45,711
Oh,

6598
03:01:45,711 --> 03:01:46,221
beautiful.

6599
03:01:46,221 --> 03:01:47,770
Jab and then switches.

6600
03:01:47,780 --> 03:01:48,401
Stance.

6601
03:01:48,401 --> 03:01:49,234
Got Angles,

6602
03:01:49,370 --> 03:01:49,851
dude.

6603
03:01:49,851 --> 03:01:50,240
He's,

6604
03:01:50,240 --> 03:01:52,280
he's very creative man.

6605
03:01:53,480 --> 03:01:54,410
Very creative.

6606
03:01:54,411 --> 03:01:55,010
Look at that.

6607
03:01:55,010 --> 03:01:55,843
Rack

6608
03:01:56,790 --> 03:01:57,480
them up though.

6609
03:01:57,480 --> 03:01:58,313
Stay on their bed.

6610
03:01:59,710 --> 03:02:02,290
How about keep holding on that leg
and kicking the shit out of it,

6611
03:02:05,900 --> 03:02:06,733
dude.

6612
03:02:12,740 --> 03:02:13,573
Yeah.

6613
03:02:14,310 --> 03:02:15,960
I think if Ben's going
to try and win this,

6614
03:02:15,961 --> 03:02:18,200
he needs to go for singles and get them.

6615
03:02:18,330 --> 03:02:20,230
I liked that right hook to the buyer.

6616
03:02:20,290 --> 03:02:23,820
Then stepping in with that
is he's landed that a lot,

6617
03:02:23,821 --> 03:02:24,061
man.

6618
03:02:24,061 --> 03:02:25,290
That's a nasty shot.

6619
03:02:26,660 --> 03:02:26,881
Yeah.

6620
03:02:26,881 --> 03:02:27,990
That's a nasty shot,

6621
03:02:27,991 --> 03:02:28,824
man.

6622
03:02:29,100 --> 03:02:30,720
You might be trying to set up the up top,

6623
03:02:30,721 --> 03:02:31,230
right.

6624
03:02:31,230 --> 03:02:36,150
Get a guy to get used to cover covering
that because he expects it and then go

6625
03:02:36,151 --> 03:02:36,984
over the top.

6626
03:02:37,230 --> 03:02:39,030
I think that just a number head kick,

6627
03:02:39,031 --> 03:02:40,860
he keeps going low into the body.

6628
03:02:41,730 --> 03:02:41,881
Well,

6629
03:02:41,881 --> 03:02:44,430
he would think that he would
have an advantage in speed,

6630
03:02:44,580 --> 03:02:46,340
but what he might have an advantage is,

6631
03:02:46,341 --> 03:02:46,830
is,

6632
03:02:46,830 --> 03:02:47,730
is pace.

6633
03:02:47,940 --> 03:02:50,610
The ability to keep that
pace up for five rounds.

6634
03:02:50,611 --> 03:02:52,140
He's done that so many times.

6635
03:02:52,290 --> 03:02:56,610
Like Benson is a master at understanding
his own limitations as far as like

6636
03:02:56,611 --> 03:02:57,360
cardio.

6637
03:02:57,360 --> 03:02:59,550
Like he keeps a solid fucking pace.

6638
03:02:59,580 --> 03:03:01,230
He knows exactly how to red line and,

6639
03:03:01,370 --> 03:03:02,880
and he could read it for five rounds.

6640
03:03:02,881 --> 03:03:05,160
He knows his body real well in wars,

6641
03:03:05,490 --> 03:03:06,120
you know,

6642
03:03:06,120 --> 03:03:07,870
let you think of those
Frankie Edgar fight.

6643
03:03:08,280 --> 03:03:11,010
He's got some hard five round fights.

6644
03:03:11,070 --> 03:03:11,903
You know,

6645
03:03:12,630 --> 03:03:13,920
that's a huge advantage.

6646
03:03:14,130 --> 03:03:16,530
Especially knowing you've been there,

6647
03:03:16,531 --> 03:03:16,771
you know,

6648
03:03:16,771 --> 03:03:19,320
the territory as opposed to thatch.

6649
03:03:19,350 --> 03:03:21,240
I think that's his biggest
advantage in this fight.

6650
03:03:21,241 --> 03:03:22,590
And I don't feel like he's using it.

6651
03:03:23,260 --> 03:03:24,900
We're going into round three now.

6652
03:03:24,990 --> 03:03:25,410
I mean,

6653
03:03:25,410 --> 03:03:26,243
this is right when he,

6654
03:03:26,510 --> 03:03:27,343
if you know,

6655
03:03:27,630 --> 03:03:29,760
you gotta think John Crouch his coach,

6656
03:03:30,120 --> 03:03:31,560
one of the geniuses of MMA.

6657
03:03:31,770 --> 03:03:33,010
There's like a handful of geniuses.

6658
03:03:33,090 --> 03:03:34,980
It's like Matt Hume for Rasa hobbies.

6659
03:03:34,981 --> 03:03:35,814
One of my favorite,

6660
03:03:36,030 --> 03:03:38,370
Greg Jackson has a lot of knowledge.

6661
03:03:38,580 --> 03:03:39,090
You know,

6662
03:03:39,090 --> 03:03:41,580
Ricardo Laborio is a genius of MMA.

6663
03:03:41,581 --> 03:03:42,181
There's like these,

6664
03:03:42,181 --> 03:03:45,540
these are a few Maestros John
Danaher does a few of them.

6665
03:03:45,710 --> 03:03:46,830
John Crouch is one of them.

6666
03:03:46,950 --> 03:03:49,590
So when you're agreeing
to fight a kid like this,

6667
03:03:49,680 --> 03:03:50,610
he's not dumb.

6668
03:03:50,790 --> 03:03:52,980
He knows this kid's a
fucking giant savage.

6669
03:03:53,190 --> 03:03:53,560
You know,

6670
03:03:53,560 --> 03:03:57,890
there's gotta be some thought
to what the proper strategy is.

6671
03:03:57,891 --> 03:03:58,610
And

6672
03:03:58,610 --> 03:03:59,540
you know,

6673
03:03:59,541 --> 03:04:01,730
the kid is good as anybody and you,

6674
03:04:01,731 --> 03:04:03,500
your thoughts are third round,

6675
03:04:03,501 --> 03:04:03,891
fourth round.

6676
03:04:03,891 --> 03:04:04,724
Fifth round.

6677
03:04:05,200 --> 03:04:06,033
Yes.

6678
03:04:06,250 --> 03:04:07,041
[inaudible] coach.

6679
03:04:07,041 --> 03:04:07,521
I'm saying all right,

6680
03:04:07,521 --> 03:04:08,650
now let's start mixing it up.

6681
03:04:08,670 --> 03:04:09,201
Grappling,

6682
03:04:09,201 --> 03:04:10,960
go for shots where his ass out.

6683
03:04:11,480 --> 03:04:13,130
It was clearly lost two rounds though.

6684
03:04:13,610 --> 03:04:14,001
Clearly.

6685
03:04:14,001 --> 03:04:14,840
Most likely.

6686
03:04:14,841 --> 03:04:15,320
Yeah.

6687
03:04:15,320 --> 03:04:16,490
I mean in Denver.

6688
03:04:17,060 --> 03:04:19,940
And he had double under hooks at one
time when they were transitioning out,

6689
03:04:20,320 --> 03:04:20,630
uh,

6690
03:04:20,630 --> 03:04:23,930
on a failed spin and he didn't
even try to take him down.

6691
03:04:23,970 --> 03:04:25,030
I thought he would have
tried to dump them.

6692
03:04:25,830 --> 03:04:26,663
Right.

6693
03:04:27,760 --> 03:04:28,760
That's his hometown.

6694
03:04:28,820 --> 03:04:30,420
And he felt it and it went away.

6695
03:04:30,440 --> 03:04:31,273
Yeah.

6696
03:04:31,370 --> 03:04:33,020
But there was like 17 seconds left.

6697
03:04:33,040 --> 03:04:34,520
Altitudes short notice.

6698
03:04:35,100 --> 03:04:35,610
Yeah.

6699
03:04:35,610 --> 03:04:36,350
He went front,

6700
03:04:36,350 --> 03:04:37,550
like round kick to the head.

6701
03:04:37,551 --> 03:04:38,690
You don't see that that often.

6702
03:04:38,691 --> 03:04:39,320
No switch.

6703
03:04:39,320 --> 03:04:40,550
I bet you see some take downs.

6704
03:04:40,970 --> 03:04:42,620
Got a lot of taekwondo and him as well,

6705
03:04:42,621 --> 03:04:42,951
man.

6706
03:04:42,951 --> 03:04:43,221
You know,

6707
03:04:43,221 --> 03:04:44,810
I mean that was his initial background.

6708
03:04:46,250 --> 03:04:49,430
Well the thing is is we've seen
two takedowns both from thatch.

6709
03:04:49,550 --> 03:04:49,910
Yup.

6710
03:04:49,910 --> 03:04:53,390
And they were ragdoll
takedowns it would take downs.

6711
03:04:53,391 --> 03:04:55,010
We expect someone to say bitch.

6712
03:04:55,090 --> 03:04:55,840
Yeah,

6713
03:04:55,840 --> 03:04:57,080
he thought he dumped them twice.

6714
03:04:57,320 --> 03:04:58,153
You know

6715
03:05:00,020 --> 03:05:02,770
I liked that right hook to the
body that Benson has been thrown.

6716
03:05:02,840 --> 03:05:06,770
It's very interesting to me like Oh shit.

6717
03:05:06,860 --> 03:05:09,830
Oh no right hand behind
it got a size advantage.

6718
03:05:09,950 --> 03:05:10,730
Oh he's so big.

6719
03:05:10,730 --> 03:05:11,770
He's really good at,

6720
03:05:11,780 --> 03:05:15,560
I mean I'm going to freak
out if Ben doesn't attempt
to take don and I'm a freak

6721
03:05:15,561 --> 03:05:16,540
out and eat this mic.

6722
03:05:18,190 --> 03:05:21,020
You got an attempt at man cause
you're getting fucking picked apart.

6723
03:05:21,590 --> 03:05:22,610
Do you think he's getting picked apart?

6724
03:05:22,611 --> 03:05:23,720
I wouldn't say it that much.

6725
03:05:23,900 --> 03:05:25,070
I don't think he's getting picked apart.

6726
03:05:25,360 --> 03:05:25,581
Yeah,

6727
03:05:25,581 --> 03:05:26,211
but you know what,

6728
03:05:26,211 --> 03:05:26,450
man,

6729
03:05:26,450 --> 03:05:29,900
I don't think he likes the way it feels
like he feels how strong those hips

6730
03:05:29,901 --> 03:05:30,680
already is.

6731
03:05:30,680 --> 03:05:31,590
This a abort.

6732
03:05:31,770 --> 03:05:32,230
Yeah,

6733
03:05:32,230 --> 03:05:33,170
we don't want crazy.

6734
03:05:33,450 --> 03:05:34,283
Did it again?

6735
03:05:34,400 --> 03:05:35,233
Yeah,

6736
03:05:35,720 --> 03:05:36,553
there we go.

6737
03:05:37,410 --> 03:05:38,950
Now let's keep her against
the cage is going to be

6738
03:05:40,680 --> 03:05:42,680
one 70 bro.

6739
03:05:42,681 --> 03:05:44,150
This is one 70 I know,

6740
03:05:44,151 --> 03:05:46,370
but you're wearing
thatch out where I'm out.

6741
03:05:46,371 --> 03:05:47,150
But look,

6742
03:05:47,150 --> 03:05:47,871
look at this though.

6743
03:05:47,871 --> 03:05:49,390
This is one seventies this is,

6744
03:05:50,330 --> 03:05:52,040
if you're going to win this
exactly what you gotta do,

6745
03:05:53,320 --> 03:05:54,620
his savage sheet,

6746
03:05:54,621 --> 03:05:55,454
if you don't get it,

6747
03:05:56,330 --> 03:05:57,163
that's fine.

6748
03:05:57,290 --> 03:05:58,460
Taches and comfortable here.

6749
03:05:58,461 --> 03:05:59,920
I guarantee you attaching a slow down.

6750
03:05:59,940 --> 03:06:01,040
I'll be listening to Brendan,

6751
03:06:05,210 --> 03:06:05,571
Brendan,

6752
03:06:05,571 --> 03:06:06,270
shop this.

6753
03:06:06,270 --> 03:06:07,490
He's to knows the kid.

6754
03:06:07,520 --> 03:06:08,331
Oh,

6755
03:06:08,331 --> 03:06:09,740
let's give it up the bag.

6756
03:06:13,660 --> 03:06:18,620
Give it up the back and big deep
breaths and now confusion and a loss of

6757
03:06:18,621 --> 03:06:19,490
confidence as well.

6758
03:06:19,491 --> 03:06:20,280
Right?

6759
03:06:20,280 --> 03:06:21,680
And this is Ben's world.

6760
03:06:21,710 --> 03:06:22,610
He's a grappler.

6761
03:06:22,940 --> 03:06:24,020
This is what he does,

6762
03:06:24,070 --> 03:06:26,480
but it's got a crap a little bit.

6763
03:06:26,481 --> 03:06:29,220
Come on Henderson when Ben Henderson is

6764
03:06:31,670 --> 03:06:32,690
trap the arm.

6765
03:06:33,290 --> 03:06:34,820
Dad's got out of it pretty quick though.

6766
03:06:35,780 --> 03:06:36,351
But look at,

6767
03:06:36,351 --> 03:06:36,621
you know,

6768
03:06:36,621 --> 03:06:38,840
he's letting them know like
some shit's going down.

6769
03:06:38,880 --> 03:06:39,080
Yeah,

6770
03:06:39,080 --> 03:06:39,280
son,

6771
03:06:39,280 --> 03:06:39,970
you're my world.

6772
03:06:39,970 --> 03:06:40,230
Yeah.

6773
03:06:40,230 --> 03:06:40,470
Sweet.

6774
03:06:40,470 --> 03:06:40,971
Stand up.

6775
03:06:40,971 --> 03:06:41,804
Check this out.

6776
03:06:42,560 --> 03:06:44,030
You're in a bad spot here kid.

6777
03:06:44,060 --> 03:06:44,990
Hold on to that glove.

6778
03:06:50,010 --> 03:06:51,110
He's hit him in the Dick.

6779
03:06:52,190 --> 03:06:52,521
Oh,

6780
03:06:52,521 --> 03:06:53,271
look at statues.

6781
03:06:53,271 --> 03:06:54,104
I man,

6782
03:06:54,500 --> 03:06:55,333
look at his right.

6783
03:06:55,570 --> 03:06:55,791
You know,

6784
03:06:55,791 --> 03:06:56,040
what does

6785
03:06:56,040 --> 03:06:57,300
that swollen or is he just,

6786
03:06:57,450 --> 03:06:58,290
is it just the angle?

6787
03:06:58,291 --> 03:06:59,350
We're looking at it now.

6788
03:06:59,360 --> 03:07:00,131
It's slowly.

6789
03:07:00,131 --> 03:07:00,371
I mean,

6790
03:07:00,371 --> 03:07:02,940
you know how it is if you're
not really a grappler,

6791
03:07:03,820 --> 03:07:05,700
you know by nature when
someone has your back,

6792
03:07:05,701 --> 03:07:08,940
your heart's fucking a little over
a hundred miles an hour right now.

6793
03:07:09,030 --> 03:07:10,420
So even if you don't submit them,

6794
03:07:10,421 --> 03:07:11,600
here we are on this fourth round.

6795
03:07:11,620 --> 03:07:12,250
You're in trouble,

6796
03:07:12,250 --> 03:07:12,930
bro.

6797
03:07:12,930 --> 03:07:13,830
Benson's making some,

6798
03:07:13,980 --> 03:07:14,160
uh,

6799
03:07:14,160 --> 03:07:14,700
some,

6800
03:07:14,700 --> 03:07:16,350
some progress with that right arm.

6801
03:07:16,560 --> 03:07:18,570
He's moving that right
arm closer and closer.

6802
03:07:19,500 --> 03:07:19,831
I mean,

6803
03:07:19,831 --> 03:07:20,340
he's,

6804
03:07:20,340 --> 03:07:22,680
he's under is under the
armpit with the other one,

6805
03:07:23,670 --> 03:07:25,620
but I'm seeing some give,

6806
03:07:25,650 --> 03:07:26,341
you know what I'm saying?

6807
03:07:26,341 --> 03:07:29,250
You know how when you see a guy started
to pull on the guy's neck and you see

6808
03:07:29,251 --> 03:07:29,731
the guy in there.

6809
03:07:29,731 --> 03:07:30,750
So I started to give,

6810
03:07:31,780 --> 03:07:32,231
he's like,

6811
03:07:32,231 --> 03:07:33,170
I see giving,

6812
03:07:35,400 --> 03:07:36,233
it's tough.

6813
03:07:37,350 --> 03:07:42,300
It's tough with the gloves
man to submitted guy for
even if was body triangle by

6814
03:07:42,301 --> 03:07:43,620
triangle do to flatten them out.

6815
03:07:44,080 --> 03:07:45,170
Softening up man.

6816
03:07:45,540 --> 03:07:46,890
He's got a minute 18 to go.

6817
03:07:46,891 --> 03:07:48,800
This fight could be over
right fucking minute.

6818
03:07:48,840 --> 03:07:50,640
18 is a long time.

6819
03:07:50,700 --> 03:07:53,940
It's a long time dude on your
back and his eye swollen.

6820
03:07:54,200 --> 03:07:59,040
We got a good job of defending this long
that tells me he's probably not going

6821
03:07:59,041 --> 03:07:59,430
to get them.

6822
03:07:59,430 --> 03:08:00,490
This is exhausting.

6823
03:08:00,500 --> 03:08:01,560
No match.

6824
03:08:01,740 --> 03:08:03,240
He can be very exhausting,

6825
03:08:03,241 --> 03:08:03,600
son.

6826
03:08:03,600 --> 03:08:04,433
This is the,

6827
03:08:04,830 --> 03:08:06,000
this is exciting stuff,

6828
03:08:06,001 --> 03:08:06,834
man.

6829
03:08:07,280 --> 03:08:08,730
[inaudible] back.

6830
03:08:09,150 --> 03:08:09,983
[inaudible]

6831
03:08:11,570 --> 03:08:12,780
can I be on fire?

6832
03:08:12,990 --> 03:08:13,750
I mean he's,

6833
03:08:13,750 --> 03:08:14,101
he knows.

6834
03:08:14,101 --> 03:08:16,200
All he has to do to survive
can be resting right here.

6835
03:08:16,250 --> 03:08:16,610
Yeah.

6836
03:08:16,610 --> 03:08:17,760
It's going to take a lot out of that.

6837
03:08:17,890 --> 03:08:21,150
That just never not like
diversity out of them.

6838
03:08:21,151 --> 03:08:24,960
You got to realize all that all fetches
wins where first round Kaos that body

6839
03:08:24,961 --> 03:08:25,794
triangle.

6840
03:08:25,830 --> 03:08:27,690
It looks like his right eye.

6841
03:08:27,691 --> 03:08:28,800
It looks like she's riding them.

6842
03:08:28,801 --> 03:08:29,610
Both of them.

6843
03:08:29,610 --> 03:08:30,930
Both of them are fucked up.

6844
03:08:31,530 --> 03:08:32,100
You're right.

6845
03:08:32,100 --> 03:08:33,090
They're both fucked up.

6846
03:08:33,990 --> 03:08:35,490
He's sneaky side browse though.

6847
03:08:36,310 --> 03:08:36,511
Yeah,

6848
03:08:36,511 --> 03:08:37,344
I'm not mad.

6849
03:08:38,100 --> 03:08:38,910
Oh No.

6850
03:08:38,910 --> 03:08:40,090
Oh No.

6851
03:08:40,130 --> 03:08:41,510
I a spiderweb.

6852
03:08:43,370 --> 03:08:45,300
20 seconds catches up now.

6853
03:08:45,301 --> 03:08:46,710
We'll see what he's got smart though.

6854
03:08:46,920 --> 03:08:47,850
He had to go for something,

6855
03:08:47,851 --> 03:08:48,091
right?

6856
03:08:48,091 --> 03:08:48,390
Yeah.

6857
03:08:48,390 --> 03:08:49,223
Yup.

6858
03:08:49,710 --> 03:08:50,810
This round ends fourth rounds.

6859
03:08:50,820 --> 03:08:51,950
Got To fix a ponytail now.

6860
03:08:52,080 --> 03:08:52,980
Straight single leg.

6861
03:08:52,981 --> 03:08:53,520
If I'm Ben.

6862
03:08:53,520 --> 03:08:54,353
Hi as well.

6863
03:08:54,410 --> 03:08:54,910
I'm just,

6864
03:08:54,910 --> 03:08:55,890
it's loose Eddie,

6865
03:08:55,891 --> 03:08:56,724
whatever.

6866
03:08:56,850 --> 03:08:57,683
Look at that.

6867
03:09:01,980 --> 03:09:02,770
He just wants to stay away.

6868
03:09:02,770 --> 03:09:03,690
You have that round to Ben,

6869
03:09:03,720 --> 03:09:04,020
right?

6870
03:09:04,020 --> 03:09:04,350
Yeah.

6871
03:09:04,350 --> 03:09:04,591
Yeah.

6872
03:09:04,591 --> 03:09:04,920
He gets it.

6873
03:09:04,920 --> 03:09:07,010
He got a two to one going
back and forth to two.

6874
03:09:07,020 --> 03:09:08,400
One go on the fourth and the grappling.

6875
03:09:08,401 --> 03:09:10,620
Some established that he's
super dominant on the ground.

6876
03:09:11,010 --> 03:09:13,320
The only reason why I lost that
position because he went for the arm.

6877
03:09:13,321 --> 03:09:13,560
True.

6878
03:09:13,560 --> 03:09:14,250
I'll say this.

6879
03:09:14,250 --> 03:09:15,450
Who is more tired?

6880
03:09:15,720 --> 03:09:17,460
Benson or thatch.

6881
03:09:17,520 --> 03:09:18,353
That statue.

6882
03:09:18,740 --> 03:09:20,910
I'm saying defending that easy day,

6883
03:09:20,970 --> 03:09:22,220
trying to attack the basket.

6884
03:09:22,240 --> 03:09:24,180
I'm easy day if you're not a black belt,

6885
03:09:24,210 --> 03:09:25,230
if you're a blue belt,

6886
03:09:25,231 --> 03:09:25,920
which I,

6887
03:09:25,920 --> 03:09:28,290
I would say that just probably
a blue belt on the ground,

6888
03:09:28,470 --> 03:09:28,950
but I'm not.

6889
03:09:28,950 --> 03:09:31,170
The type for one big
explosion was the arm.

6890
03:09:31,350 --> 03:09:32,910
Other than that was just control.

6891
03:09:33,030 --> 03:09:33,271
I mean,

6892
03:09:33,271 --> 03:09:36,360
when he's tight and when he's under
the armpit and he's across the neck,

6893
03:09:36,361 --> 03:09:37,470
there was no commitment.

6894
03:09:37,530 --> 03:09:40,170
There was no real crazy
day in the squeeze.

6895
03:09:40,200 --> 03:09:40,351
Yeah,

6896
03:09:40,351 --> 03:09:41,071
but there's no luck.

6897
03:09:41,071 --> 03:09:41,820
Crazy like go,

6898
03:09:41,820 --> 03:09:43,320
you know the go for a guillotine.

6899
03:09:43,500 --> 03:09:44,071
Hail Mary.

6900
03:09:44,071 --> 03:09:44,904
That doesn't work.

6901
03:09:44,960 --> 03:09:46,290
The guys arms cash out.

6902
03:09:46,490 --> 03:09:47,430
It wasn't none of that.

6903
03:09:48,000 --> 03:09:50,190
There was an explosion
to get to spider web,

6904
03:09:50,191 --> 03:09:52,980
but I mean that was one big burst.

6905
03:09:53,020 --> 03:09:53,853
Yeah.

6906
03:09:54,130 --> 03:09:57,520
Other than that it was statue eight more
energy because that's what's trying to

6907
03:09:57,521 --> 03:09:58,900
keep that guy off his neck.

6908
03:09:59,050 --> 03:10:00,160
He was uncomfortable.

6909
03:10:00,161 --> 03:10:05,161
He's got fuck in my hometown and getting
choked Roald Dahl shores flat out with

6910
03:10:05,681 --> 03:10:06,960
a body triangle on its back.

6911
03:10:07,960 --> 03:10:09,460
Shit got real.

6912
03:10:10,240 --> 03:10:12,100
Both eyes are all swollen and shit.

6913
03:10:12,550 --> 03:10:14,500
His braids all fucked up out the back.

6914
03:10:15,640 --> 03:10:17,110
He didn't fix his ponytail.

6915
03:10:18,850 --> 03:10:20,950
I shoot for that single leg if I'm Ben.

6916
03:10:22,000 --> 03:10:23,550
Yeah.

6917
03:10:23,980 --> 03:10:24,813
Yup.

6918
03:10:24,850 --> 03:10:26,500
Now he's thinking about to maybe mix up.

6919
03:10:26,501 --> 03:10:28,090
You shoot and hit him with a right hand.

6920
03:10:28,190 --> 03:10:28,430
Well,

6921
03:10:28,430 --> 03:10:31,780
he also knows that he can
dominate him on do it.

6922
03:10:32,200 --> 03:10:32,471
Yeah.

6923
03:10:32,471 --> 03:10:34,390
I mean that's just a fact
of standing up so high.

6924
03:10:34,391 --> 03:10:34,691
It's still,

6925
03:10:34,691 --> 03:10:38,560
he's still got that high kick boxer
stance and that was the reason he got

6926
03:10:38,561 --> 03:10:42,040
impatient in that scramble
and wasn't smart defensively.

6927
03:10:42,041 --> 03:10:46,360
Wanted to just get back up to his feet
instead of like minus p's and q's and

6928
03:10:46,361 --> 03:10:48,550
recognizing he's in a bad spot and that,

6929
03:10:48,610 --> 03:10:48,940
that,

6930
03:10:48,940 --> 03:10:50,140
that recklessness,

6931
03:10:50,260 --> 03:10:53,380
carelessness and trying to get back up
to his feet is where it gave us back.

6932
03:10:53,381 --> 03:10:55,060
That comes in grappling experience.

6933
03:10:55,360 --> 03:10:56,590
That's just not his background.

6934
03:10:56,591 --> 03:10:56,920
Yup.

6935
03:10:56,920 --> 03:10:58,190
He just wants to get
the fuck out of there.

6936
03:10:58,191 --> 03:10:58,600
It's like,

6937
03:10:58,600 --> 03:10:59,740
I don't want to stay in this spot.

6938
03:10:59,760 --> 03:11:00,220
Yup.

6939
03:11:00,220 --> 03:11:01,150
But in doing so,

6940
03:11:01,151 --> 03:11:02,950
he got to a way worst spot,

6941
03:11:03,280 --> 03:11:03,821
which is,

6942
03:11:03,821 --> 03:11:04,360
you know,

6943
03:11:04,360 --> 03:11:05,710
really the essence of Jujitsu,

6944
03:11:05,711 --> 03:11:06,070
right.

6945
03:11:06,070 --> 03:11:07,240
Capitalizing on mistakes.

6946
03:11:07,241 --> 03:11:08,710
Even if that's loses this fight,

6947
03:11:08,711 --> 03:11:11,860
he's going to learn so much from this
fight that's going to help him in the

6948
03:11:11,861 --> 03:11:12,490
future.

6949
03:11:12,490 --> 03:11:14,020
This is because he's
never fought a really,

6950
03:11:14,021 --> 03:11:16,000
really good grappler like crazy.

6951
03:11:16,001 --> 03:11:19,060
He's gone into deep waters
with a world champion.

6952
03:11:19,140 --> 03:11:21,100
This is the best thing for
Thatcher's career to ever happen.

6953
03:11:21,130 --> 03:11:21,700
Winter loose.

6954
03:11:21,700 --> 03:11:21,971
Yeah.

6955
03:11:21,971 --> 03:11:25,180
I agree with you 100% and
it's a smart way to do it too.

6956
03:11:25,181 --> 03:11:27,880
To go on a world champion coming
up from a lower weight class.

6957
03:11:27,881 --> 03:11:29,530
So you have some advantages going in.

6958
03:11:30,160 --> 03:11:30,581
There you go,

6959
03:11:30,581 --> 03:11:31,170
Ben.

6960
03:11:31,170 --> 03:11:31,330
No.

6961
03:11:31,330 --> 03:11:32,410
Keep that hat on the inside.

6962
03:11:32,490 --> 03:11:34,420
Not going to happen either way.

6963
03:11:34,421 --> 03:11:34,990
This is wearing,

6964
03:11:34,990 --> 03:11:35,471
that's out.

6965
03:11:35,471 --> 03:11:36,730
I like this sprawl dude.

6966
03:11:36,740 --> 03:11:37,573
Sprawl

6967
03:11:39,280 --> 03:11:40,130
come up with a flat.

6968
03:11:40,210 --> 03:11:40,451
Yeah,

6969
03:11:40,451 --> 03:11:43,270
let's make them defend and
then go after it again.

6970
03:11:43,280 --> 03:11:43,840
Right?

6971
03:11:43,840 --> 03:11:44,230
Yeah.

6972
03:11:44,230 --> 03:11:47,960
He's throwing his striking off with those
take down a sloth that just becoming

6973
03:11:48,030 --> 03:11:51,760
as stances like he stands so tall.

6974
03:11:51,790 --> 03:11:54,850
Nice knee to begin with.

6975
03:11:54,930 --> 03:11:55,520
This flow,

6976
03:11:55,520 --> 03:11:56,650
that right hand to the body.

6977
03:11:56,650 --> 03:11:57,310
Again,

6978
03:11:57,310 --> 03:11:59,950
this plan only works if
Ben's Cardio's on point.

6979
03:12:00,220 --> 03:12:04,030
Well it's most likely will
be to me it looks like,

6980
03:12:04,031 --> 03:12:04,910
I know you guys are,

6981
03:12:05,150 --> 03:12:09,600
it looks like fat just as fine
and he's coming forward and he's,

6982
03:12:09,820 --> 03:12:11,020
he's definitely not the same fighter.

6983
03:12:11,021 --> 03:12:15,220
He wasn't the first two rounds but the
fifth round at altitude you're in Denver

6984
03:12:15,221 --> 03:12:15,850
son.

6985
03:12:15,850 --> 03:12:16,780
Sorry about it,

6986
03:12:16,810 --> 03:12:21,640
but that's what that's going to last
year and the fifth round is going to be

6987
03:12:21,760 --> 03:12:22,630
tough.

6988
03:12:23,910 --> 03:12:28,150
Mental drains it out to two shows in
our results of Ben's career was spent in

6989
03:12:28,151 --> 03:12:28,810
Colorado.

6990
03:12:28,810 --> 03:12:30,190
John Crouch started in Denver,

6991
03:12:30,370 --> 03:12:31,720
so this is nothing new to Ben.

6992
03:12:32,650 --> 03:12:34,360
[inaudible]

6993
03:12:36,710 --> 03:12:37,543
timing.

6994
03:12:37,950 --> 03:12:38,783
Yeah,

6995
03:12:39,010 --> 03:12:40,330
that was beautiful timing.

6996
03:12:40,760 --> 03:12:42,130
Stepping over that leg.

6997
03:12:42,160 --> 03:12:42,371
Look at.

6998
03:12:42,371 --> 03:12:44,990
This is sue my friend.

6999
03:12:46,330 --> 03:12:47,920
Oh my friend.

7000
03:12:47,921 --> 03:12:49,210
You got along the time.

7001
03:12:49,270 --> 03:12:50,110
Arm Triangles.

7002
03:12:50,111 --> 03:12:52,190
Common stepping over.

7003
03:12:52,190 --> 03:12:54,890
Look at this side control my friend.

7004
03:12:55,480 --> 03:12:58,710
Oh that matches back.

7005
03:12:58,760 --> 03:13:01,730
Son did the same thing again.

7006
03:13:02,490 --> 03:13:04,850
The position didn't like the position.

7007
03:13:04,910 --> 03:13:05,440
Oh,

7008
03:13:05,440 --> 03:13:07,640
Hookin got that hook in easy.

7009
03:13:07,670 --> 03:13:08,960
Doesn't mean he's going to choke him.

7010
03:13:09,080 --> 03:13:09,660
No,

7011
03:13:09,660 --> 03:13:10,680
he's when the job

7012
03:13:12,420 --> 03:13:13,180
he's going to win the round.

7013
03:13:13,180 --> 03:13:15,090
Elliot's looking at this
going and making a list.

7014
03:13:15,100 --> 03:13:16,970
Going to try to go for
the arm bar again man.

7015
03:13:17,550 --> 03:13:18,920
He's going to try to go for the arm bar.

7016
03:13:19,740 --> 03:13:20,690
Oh Nice.

7017
03:13:21,170 --> 03:13:22,003
Look at this though.

7018
03:13:22,040 --> 03:13:24,170
But still I don't like
just being on top man.

7019
03:13:24,171 --> 03:13:25,004
I'd rather

7020
03:13:26,250 --> 03:13:27,980
get a high level grappler on Ya.

7021
03:13:28,130 --> 03:13:28,963
Yeah Dude.

7022
03:13:29,190 --> 03:13:29,721
How joke?

7023
03:13:29,721 --> 03:13:30,410
Look at this.

7024
03:13:30,410 --> 03:13:32,690
Benson transitions easy to the back again.

7025
03:13:32,960 --> 03:13:34,250
You see a lot of wrestlers do this.

7026
03:13:34,251 --> 03:13:36,050
Turn off forest hand fight and stand up.

7027
03:13:36,400 --> 03:13:37,700
Statues a kickboxer.

7028
03:13:37,701 --> 03:13:38,990
Let's not do that.

7029
03:13:40,130 --> 03:13:41,080
It's a natural thing.

7030
03:13:42,180 --> 03:13:44,720
Your natural trying to get back up.

7031
03:13:44,810 --> 03:13:45,610
Oh Shit.

7032
03:13:45,610 --> 03:13:46,443
Can you get back up?

7033
03:13:46,730 --> 03:13:47,270
Oh,

7034
03:13:47,270 --> 03:13:48,103
rag,

7035
03:13:48,830 --> 03:13:50,660
rag doll and should it be natural though?

7036
03:13:50,661 --> 03:13:51,201
You know what I'm saying?

7037
03:13:51,201 --> 03:13:51,431
Eddie,

7038
03:13:51,431 --> 03:13:53,100
if you're training when the wild though,

7039
03:13:58,000 --> 03:14:00,230
this is the world of Benson
Henderson right here.

7040
03:14:00,240 --> 03:14:01,940
So

7041
03:14:05,210 --> 03:14:06,170
he got this shit

7042
03:14:11,290 --> 03:14:12,123
in

7043
03:14:16,280 --> 03:14:17,520
his mouth.

7044
03:14:21,170 --> 03:14:22,160
He fixed it in the last,

7045
03:14:22,310 --> 03:14:24,710
oh my God.

7046
03:14:24,711 --> 03:14:24,981
I was like,

7047
03:14:24,981 --> 03:14:28,130
I pulled a tooth pick out of
his mouth right after he tapped,

7048
03:14:28,131 --> 03:14:29,630
gets so fucked up.

7049
03:14:29,660 --> 03:14:31,130
You know he's gonna get
in trouble for that.

7050
03:14:31,840 --> 03:14:33,440
They told them not to do that anymore.

7051
03:14:34,220 --> 03:14:35,053
No contest.

7052
03:14:35,600 --> 03:14:36,650
So crazy.

7053
03:14:36,651 --> 03:14:38,750
Fight to the fucking
toothpick in his mouth.

7054
03:14:39,220 --> 03:14:40,190
It gets suspended.

7055
03:14:40,460 --> 03:14:41,360
He just fought Brent.

7056
03:14:41,390 --> 03:14:42,770
That's some Charles Bronson ship.

7057
03:14:42,920 --> 03:14:45,260
He just fought Brendan Dash
with a toothpick in it.

7058
03:14:46,120 --> 03:14:46,953
So

7059
03:14:51,310 --> 03:14:51,850
this,

7060
03:14:51,850 --> 03:14:54,540
this is improved bigger
Henderson fan now what?

7061
03:14:54,570 --> 03:14:55,403
Because nope,

7062
03:14:55,880 --> 03:14:57,620
that too for taking us in July.

7063
03:14:57,650 --> 03:14:58,280
That was,

7064
03:14:58,280 --> 03:14:59,113
that was awesome.

7065
03:14:59,770 --> 03:15:00,411
He didn't shoot.

7066
03:15:00,411 --> 03:15:01,250
Look how he finished it.

7067
03:15:01,280 --> 03:15:02,360
Look at the way you finished it.

7068
03:15:02,390 --> 03:15:05,150
You just see sort of,

7069
03:15:05,360 --> 03:15:07,010
but it's kind of like this,

7070
03:15:07,430 --> 03:15:07,941
like I said,

7071
03:15:07,941 --> 03:15:08,270
domain.

7072
03:15:08,270 --> 03:15:08,781
Either way.

7073
03:15:08,781 --> 03:15:10,520
Brandon's gonna learn a ton from this.

7074
03:15:10,521 --> 03:15:11,600
This is best case scenario.

7075
03:15:11,730 --> 03:15:12,920
He wins either way,

7076
03:15:14,090 --> 03:15:15,260
it goes up to one set.

7077
03:15:15,260 --> 03:15:17,480
Dan Severn isn't just about,

7078
03:15:17,620 --> 03:15:19,910
he's what with the legs are doing.

7079
03:15:20,790 --> 03:15:22,000
Squeeze that down.

7080
03:15:22,280 --> 03:15:23,780
It's a oxymoron.

7081
03:15:23,781 --> 03:15:24,614
Actually.

7082
03:15:25,720 --> 03:15:26,860
Dan's fancy.

7083
03:15:26,861 --> 03:15:28,450
He's a bad motherfucker.

7084
03:15:28,640 --> 03:15:29,240
He's,

7085
03:15:29,240 --> 03:15:30,440
he's world class man.

7086
03:15:30,441 --> 03:15:31,071
He's world class.

7087
03:15:31,071 --> 03:15:32,090
He fucked up that tooth.

7088
03:15:32,100 --> 03:15:33,060
Picto dude did.

7089
03:15:33,061 --> 03:15:34,580
She can't keep doing that man.

7090
03:15:34,910 --> 03:15:35,743
Can't keep doing that

7091
03:15:37,850 --> 03:15:38,683
fat

7092
03:15:40,340 --> 03:15:41,000
head kicked.

7093
03:15:41,000 --> 03:15:41,721
It's not the problem.

7094
03:15:41,721 --> 03:15:44,870
Like the athletic commissions can get in
trouble if it turns out that toothpick

7095
03:15:44,871 --> 03:15:47,630
comes out and poke somebody in
the eye and some strange world.

7096
03:15:47,750 --> 03:15:48,920
We're Benson's on top,

7097
03:15:48,990 --> 03:15:52,410
he gets hit with an
upkick pick comes down,

7098
03:15:52,950 --> 03:15:54,230
goes into the guy's eyeball.

7099
03:15:55,310 --> 03:15:58,420
The Guy who's doing pds
fight in an APP to fight.

7100
03:15:58,421 --> 03:15:58,611
Be Like,

7101
03:15:58,611 --> 03:15:58,741
oh,

7102
03:15:58,741 --> 03:16:00,230
he was on beat was on,

7103
03:16:00,310 --> 03:16:01,143
on the podcast.

7104
03:16:01,750 --> 03:16:02,880
It's called hold on.

7105
03:16:02,881 --> 03:16:03,211
Is that,

7106
03:16:03,211 --> 03:16:04,200
is that what happened?

7107
03:16:04,620 --> 03:16:07,560
Did they know the test
results before the fight?

7108
03:16:08,100 --> 03:16:09,020
They knew about uh,

7109
03:16:09,120 --> 03:16:09,953
Jon Jones,

7110
03:16:10,020 --> 03:16:10,950
but that's coke.

7111
03:16:12,060 --> 03:16:12,630
Okay.

7112
03:16:12,630 --> 03:16:14,580
Still petition.

7113
03:16:14,640 --> 03:16:16,290
It's not a performance enhancing drug.

7114
03:16:16,530 --> 03:16:19,890
I think if they knew that
Anderson tested positive before,

7115
03:16:19,891 --> 03:16:22,290
it's way more damning than if
they knew that John Jones did.

7116
03:16:22,470 --> 03:16:23,310
They knew that Jon Jones,

7117
03:16:23,320 --> 03:16:25,970
Johns Johns is doing something
that's going to ruin the chances.

7118
03:16:25,980 --> 03:16:27,300
What about if you're doing coke?

7119
03:16:27,330 --> 03:16:29,160
Could just study youtube videos.

7120
03:16:29,790 --> 03:16:34,250
That's maybe Coco throw a
thousand spinning kicks.

7121
03:16:34,251 --> 03:16:34,501
Yeah,

7122
03:16:34,501 --> 03:16:35,334
exactly.

7123
03:16:35,520 --> 03:16:36,120
You know what I'm saying?

7124
03:16:36,120 --> 03:16:37,340
A lot of good points here.

7125
03:16:37,420 --> 03:16:38,310
Got a good point.

7126
03:16:38,311 --> 03:16:41,690
Everyone is making it so said that
y'all aren't going to learn that.

7127
03:16:42,000 --> 03:16:42,810
What y'all are like,

7128
03:16:42,810 --> 03:16:44,010
y'all aren't going to learn anything.

7129
03:16:46,630 --> 03:16:47,281
I don't know.

7130
03:16:47,281 --> 03:16:49,140
Matt's room with these two spaces,

7131
03:16:49,141 --> 03:16:50,220
the least of our worries.

7132
03:16:50,250 --> 03:16:51,030
Hey Commission.

7133
03:16:51,030 --> 03:16:53,310
Oh we get those results back in time.

7134
03:16:53,650 --> 03:16:54,483
The toothpick.

7135
03:16:54,540 --> 03:16:55,171
That is good.

7136
03:16:55,171 --> 03:16:56,004
But God damn old,

7137
03:16:56,110 --> 03:16:56,790
he can't,

7138
03:16:56,790 --> 03:16:58,590
he can't fight with the fucking
toothpick in your mouth.

7139
03:16:58,980 --> 03:16:59,813
You just can't.

7140
03:16:59,820 --> 03:17:03,360
It's so crazy when when he stepped
out and then pull the toothpick,

7141
03:17:03,390 --> 03:17:04,530
he's like flaunting it.

7142
03:17:05,040 --> 03:17:05,671
I liked it.

7143
03:17:05,671 --> 03:17:06,504
He steps out.

7144
03:17:06,630 --> 03:17:11,630
He's got the to pick out right away
cause he's like Scott and rock dude that,

7145
03:17:13,880 --> 03:17:15,730
so he had a

7146
03:17:17,820 --> 03:17:21,780
toothpick in his mouth when pet his head
kicked him and dropped a and that was

7147
03:17:21,781 --> 03:17:22,890
the side that he tucks it.

7148
03:17:23,760 --> 03:17:25,440
I think we'd more dangerous for himself.

7149
03:17:25,441 --> 03:17:26,050
Right.

7150
03:17:26,050 --> 03:17:27,240
It's very dangerous for him.

7151
03:17:27,840 --> 03:17:28,980
Choke on toothpicks,

7152
03:17:28,981 --> 03:17:30,720
get like worn out over time.

7153
03:17:30,721 --> 03:17:34,730
They get all like bro Man,

7154
03:17:34,740 --> 03:17:35,573
he must have like,

7155
03:17:37,000 --> 03:17:37,680
you know what I'm saying?

7156
03:17:37,680 --> 03:17:38,760
He's got a weird way.

7157
03:17:39,870 --> 03:17:42,240
Just get a weird way of talking
to that thing in his mouth.

7158
03:17:43,540 --> 03:17:43,721
Yeah,

7159
03:17:43,721 --> 03:17:44,860
that shit is soft as hell.

7160
03:17:44,861 --> 03:17:45,694
That's like paper.

7161
03:18:08,400 --> 03:18:09,233
Okay.

7162
03:18:12,630 --> 03:18:14,330
I'll remember that.

7163
03:18:18,030 --> 03:18:21,010
Look beds and it sends
a bad mother fucker.

7164
03:18:21,011 --> 03:18:22,120
That was a huge victory.

7165
03:18:22,350 --> 03:18:24,190
He essentially fought your game plan.

7166
03:18:24,191 --> 03:18:25,680
What you thought he should do that?

7167
03:18:25,770 --> 03:18:26,900
I mean that's really what he did.

7168
03:18:27,570 --> 03:18:32,050
He hung with them on the feet for the
first round last probably the first and

7169
03:18:32,051 --> 03:18:34,780
second round and then took
them into some deep water.

7170
03:18:39,010 --> 03:18:39,940
That's just a funny guy.

7171
03:18:39,941 --> 03:18:40,774
I hope they interview

7172
03:18:47,370 --> 03:18:48,060
on.

7173
03:18:48,060 --> 03:18:49,170
That's exactly what he did.

7174
03:18:49,460 --> 03:18:50,293
Type movie.

7175
03:18:50,870 --> 03:18:51,703
Fuck it dude.

7176
03:18:53,660 --> 03:18:54,630
Stack up to some of the

7177
03:19:05,510 --> 03:19:06,343
championship.

7178
03:19:10,680 --> 03:19:15,070
The toothpaste philosophy lesson
so crazy with dropping knowledge.

7179
03:19:16,290 --> 03:19:16,650
Keep Up.

7180
03:19:16,650 --> 03:19:17,720
We drop knowledge.

7181
03:19:28,030 --> 03:19:28,280
Yeah.

7182
03:19:28,280 --> 03:19:31,010
When you stare across the
octagon at that fucking psycho,

7183
03:19:31,011 --> 03:19:32,390
you might want to rethink that.

7184
03:19:32,780 --> 03:19:36,830
Got 170 [inaudible] the Canadian psycho.

7185
03:19:36,860 --> 03:19:37,880
I mean there's a big difference.

7186
03:19:37,881 --> 03:19:42,440
She stepping up till like the number
arguably number to welterweight in the

7187
03:19:42,441 --> 03:19:43,274
world.

7188
03:19:44,070 --> 03:19:45,560
Then you give Roy a title shot,

7189
03:19:45,561 --> 03:19:45,820
man.

7190
03:19:45,820 --> 03:19:46,580
Yeah.

7191
03:19:46,580 --> 03:19:47,780
Don't make him fight hectare.

7192
03:19:48,080 --> 03:19:48,913
Roided out.

7193
03:19:49,620 --> 03:19:49,840
Heck,

7194
03:19:49,840 --> 03:19:51,530
there's not going to
fight for a long time now,

7195
03:19:52,040 --> 03:19:55,700
but a Goddamn Benson Henderson is a bad
motherfucker to step up like that and

7196
03:19:55,701 --> 03:19:58,340
say he wants to fight Rory
Macdonald after that fight.

7197
03:19:58,900 --> 03:20:01,060
He Benson is a bad motherfucker,

7198
03:20:01,100 --> 03:20:01,461
dude.

7199
03:20:01,461 --> 03:20:02,540
He's so good.

7200
03:20:02,900 --> 03:20:03,890
He's so good.

7201
03:20:07,360 --> 03:20:07,510
Yeah.

7202
03:20:07,510 --> 03:20:08,830
That turns a long career ahead of them.

7203
03:20:08,831 --> 03:20:10,120
This is great learning spot.

7204
03:20:10,180 --> 03:20:10,970
That layoff,

7205
03:20:10,970 --> 03:20:11,390
right?

7206
03:20:11,390 --> 03:20:12,223
Yeah.

7207
03:20:12,700 --> 03:20:13,600
Well he had some injuries,

7208
03:20:13,601 --> 03:20:14,434
right?

7209
03:20:14,880 --> 03:20:18,310
Satch threw a kick in practice
and it hit the kid's face.

7210
03:20:18,311 --> 03:20:22,660
It might've been Matt
Brown hit Mack Brown's face
compound fractured his big toe

7211
03:20:23,320 --> 03:20:24,330
compound fractures.

7212
03:20:24,331 --> 03:20:26,560
So the fucking through the
skin bones out of the skin.

7213
03:20:26,561 --> 03:20:26,950
Yeah.

7214
03:20:26,950 --> 03:20:28,060
That's why he was out for so long.

7215
03:20:28,330 --> 03:20:28,481
Oh,

7216
03:20:28,481 --> 03:20:29,240
that's what happened.

7217
03:20:29,240 --> 03:20:30,073
Jesus Christ.

7218
03:20:30,100 --> 03:20:30,341
Oh,

7219
03:20:30,341 --> 03:20:33,010
I saw the picture that there
was like a picture of it online.

7220
03:20:33,050 --> 03:20:35,110
[inaudible] did that

7221
03:20:37,220 --> 03:20:40,500
for that Dude Benson's bad ass.

7222
03:20:42,300 --> 03:20:43,133
Can you imagine him?

7223
03:20:44,080 --> 03:20:45,370
Roy needs a fight too.

7224
03:20:45,670 --> 03:20:46,870
That would be amazing.

7225
03:20:46,960 --> 03:20:47,630
That'd be amazing.

7226
03:20:47,630 --> 03:20:49,480
I just get a title shot
with a Quarry Hill.

7227
03:20:49,620 --> 03:20:50,453
Well,

7228
03:20:52,240 --> 03:20:53,530
this podcast is over.

7229
