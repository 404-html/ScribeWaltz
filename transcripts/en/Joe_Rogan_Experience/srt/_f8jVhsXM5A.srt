1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480
And Rosa,
because then we won't get shit faced.

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:05,180
I told Joe and also it occurred to me 
there's.

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,990
Joe Probably has all this other shit 
he's not going to.

4
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:10,670
Wouldn't have.
We're live.

5
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:14,690
It's not my thing,
but I'm not an anti Rosie.

6
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:17,550
Drink a fucking peanut colada moment 
present.

7
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:19,380
How to go in there.
You just enjoyed it,

8
00:00:19,381 --> 00:00:20,071
right?
Yeah,

9
00:00:20,071 --> 00:00:20,940
it was good.
I like it.

10
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,060
It's lovely time beverage.
Everybody likes some Jack Daniels.

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,330
It's single malt.
Chug this rosie first.

12
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:29,143
What does that even mean?
It's just in one of those barrels and 

13
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:34,000
barrel to what?
You move it around a bunch.

14
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,660
Yeah.
You've Ribeiro that fucking shotgun.

15
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,900
I've listened to the Jimi Hendrix live 
machine gun,

16
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:45,780
you know?
That's God damn.

17
00:00:45,781 --> 00:00:46,614
That's,
that's one of those songs where 

18
00:00:47,491 --> 00:00:51,180
sometimes you hear it and you just go,
oh wow.

19
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:52,043
Like I've met.
Maybe been missing out on how good this 

20
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:58,570
fucking song is there.
He's conjuring shit up out.

21
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:04,830
It's just so good.
You have that band of Gypsies record.

22
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:05,581
Exactly.
Yeah.

23
00:01:05,581 --> 00:01:07,980
It's all live.
I almost just stopped myself from saying

24
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:08,823
fuck.
And then I realized where we were just 

25
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:10,533
thinking radio show.
Have we ever thought that one up on the 

26
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:18,570
radio and the censored radio?
I don't know,

27
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,870
but there's this song called a power of 
love,

28
00:01:21,871 --> 00:01:22,990
so I just wanna keep talking about 
Jimmy.

29
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:27,350
That's fucking insane.
I mean all this stuff's in saint,

30
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,193
but there's this tone that he hits that 
just like carves a piece out of your 

31
00:01:33,331 --> 00:01:35,760
soul.
When I used to work with Phil Hartman,

32
00:01:35,761 --> 00:01:36,594
he told me a story about when he was at 
the whiskey and I think he was a 

33
00:01:40,921 --> 00:01:41,754
teenager,
still think phil was like 18 or 19 or 

34
00:01:43,861 --> 00:01:44,694
something and he was working as a stage 
hand and his job was to hold up the 

35
00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:50,694
speaker while Jimmy Hendrix was onstage 
because the stage was so small and the 

36
00:01:53,911 --> 00:01:56,340
speaker was kind of rocking,
so he had a stand there,

37
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,620
stand there and hold up the speaker and 
he said,

38
00:01:58,621 --> 00:02:01,650
Jimmy Hendrix was feet in front of me.

39
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:06,120
He said it was fucking incredible 
tricks.

40
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:11,220
Was just sort of becoming Hendrix.
It'd be like 1966.

41
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:17,040
I could go back over when he died and 
when he would have been like 18 or 19,

42
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:19,620
but I don't know.
She'd done 1970.

43
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,030
Really pretty sure.
Damn.

44
00:02:22,031 --> 00:02:27,031
Look at you and Encyclopedia Britannica.
Hartman died in I think 98,

45
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:32,580
so whatever that was 20 years before 
that.

46
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:33,723
There's.
This would have been like in the early 

47
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:35,490
seventies I guess.
Yeah,

48
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:36,720
that doesn't make sense.
Actually.

49
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:40,980
I wish we could go back in time and 
experience music like in the sixties and

50
00:02:40,981 --> 00:02:43,440
seventies when it goes.
Just like everything was new.

51
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,440
He'd never heard anything like that 
before.

52
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,333
Right.
It was the first time they got real 

53
00:02:48,151 --> 00:02:51,870
drugs.
Wait first time where the demonic chords

54
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:52,704
band.
We were talking about this the other 

55
00:02:52,951 --> 00:02:53,784
day,
like a long time back in the 

56
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,420
renaissance.
16 hundreds.

57
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:00,010
There was corps.
They thought to evil.

58
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,383
They heard the shit we played today.
It would be like you'd be burned at the 

59
00:03:04,061 --> 00:03:05,000
stake because.

60
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,430
Oh yeah,
fuck that.

61
00:03:09,431 --> 00:03:12,310
He would have been toast.
We'll just the beginning of Voodoo child

62
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,760
right now.
I never get sick of that.

63
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:19,110
But when you really stop and think about
like there was a.

64
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,040
There was a clear evolution,
right?

65
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:21,874
There was a bunch of shit going on.
There was chuck Berry and there was 

66
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:24,643
little Richard and then there was elvis 
and there was all these rock and roll 

67
00:03:27,431 --> 00:03:28,264
guys and then all the sudden there's 
this eruption of that and it's led 

68
00:03:32,051 --> 00:03:37,051
Zepplin and it's the WHO and it's 
hendricks and it's like people that were

69
00:03:37,491 --> 00:03:42,491
just on a completely different level,
queen queen in their prime.

70
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:44,740
But it's interesting like they all were 
driven.

71
00:03:44,741 --> 00:03:49,050
Like Zeplin was all blues music.
They just stole a of Shit.

72
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,560
So a lot of shit that's fucked up,
isn't it?

73
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,750
It's fucked up that they are dicks about
it,

74
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,033
but it's not out of the ordinary because
all those dudes were just playing each 

75
00:03:59,411 --> 00:04:00,690
other's songs.
Anyway.

76
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:01,563
Dad is a giant problem.
If you're the guy who created the 

77
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:07,330
opening riff to stairway to heaven,
it's about your song and when you try to

78
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:08,164
do with the other side of that spectrum 
is really fucked up though too because 

79
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:11,584
now you're in this game where like if 
you play anything remotely sounds like 

80
00:04:15,671 --> 00:04:19,150
that you'll get sued.
And at this point like,

81
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,850
I mean I don't rip off songs from other 
people.

82
00:04:21,851 --> 00:04:23,440
We don't do that.
But like you could make,

83
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:28,390
you could write a song and then not know
that it had a similar thing,

84
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,110
similar melody and somebody could come 
after you and that fucking blows.

85
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:33,123
We were just talking about that 
bittersweet symphony song from the 

86
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,373
verve.

87
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:37,293
How they gave all their money to the 
rolling stones because the opening riff 

88
00:04:39,971 --> 00:04:41,670
was too similar.
Which is crazy.

89
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,390
They took a sample,
isn't it?

90
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,411
It's like this.
Yeah.

91
00:04:44,411 --> 00:04:45,244
This is kind of Andrew Oldham produced 
the stones and did all this 

92
00:04:47,771 --> 00:04:49,720
orchestrations for them and they just.
Oh,

93
00:04:49,721 --> 00:04:52,000
they just said that.
How does that work though?

94
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:54,700
That seems kind of crazy that you give 
all the money.

95
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,980
I don't.
I don't mind you give him the money.

96
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:57,843
I'm sure they didn't give all of it.
I mean they had publishing on their 

97
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:01,760
actual song.
Is that different?

98
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:02,560
No,
the facts.

99
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,393
Is it different like as a musician,
do you feel like that feels different 

100
00:05:05,841 --> 00:05:09,640
with someone just uses like or like if 
someone heard ice ice baby,

101
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,550
they knew it was under pressure.
Right?

102
00:05:12,551 --> 00:05:13,384
I mean,
it's almost like it's not hurting your 

103
00:05:14,201 --> 00:05:15,034
original solid operation at that point 
because your song was inspired by 

104
00:05:17,891 --> 00:05:20,440
another song and obviously there's 
credit due for that,

105
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:21,303
but it's just an interesting way that 
the pie gets cut up and the way people 

106
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:28,570
just tenaciously hold onto their piece 
in this way.

107
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:31,240
That I don't know.
It really bums me out to be.

108
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:34,720
I mean obviously you need to get paid 
and make a living,

109
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:38,680
but inspirationally speaking,
it just.

110
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:39,543
The barometer is just so like people 
just go so far off the chorus in order 

111
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:47,350
to get credit and money for things that.
It's just bullshit,

112
00:05:47,351 --> 00:05:48,184
but I think it's so different.
You were just talking about that in 

113
00:05:49,481 --> 00:05:50,314
there.
It's so difficult to have a career that 

114
00:05:52,031 --> 00:05:56,320
keeps paying you.
If anybody has something that's close to

115
00:05:56,321 --> 00:05:57,470
the sun,
you're just like,

116
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,693
that's it because that's the only way 
I'm going to be able to afford this 

117
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,350
house.
The music business in particular or the.

118
00:06:03,351 --> 00:06:04,184
I shouldn't say the music business 
because I never really said the comedy 

119
00:06:06,501 --> 00:06:08,180
business.
I would say the comedy world,

120
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:13,900
because I think you guys are like the 
closest to big business in the way,

121
00:06:15,051 --> 00:06:16,340
like your contracts.

122
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:19,550
Are you always here?
Nike's nightmare contractual Jesus.

123
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:20,863
Like for us,
we've never made money doing anything 

124
00:06:23,391 --> 00:06:24,224
but performing,
so no one ever like got a grip of the 

125
00:06:26,781 --> 00:06:28,280
other stuff.
Right?

126
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:31,340
Like with musicians,
you guys all made a lot of money selling

127
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:36,400
actual albums back in the day.
Musicians that it could have folks to.

128
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,753
Right,
but I guess they always went through 

129
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,550
record labels.
No money in it.

130
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:43,490
There was no.
I mean I should say like a few guys made

131
00:06:43,491 --> 00:06:44,324
money,
like Dane Cook probably made a ton of 

132
00:06:45,021 --> 00:06:49,130
money because he had the biggest selling
comedy album of all time.

133
00:06:49,131 --> 00:06:52,040
His was his,
at least platinum.

134
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,053
It might've went double platinum.
Do you get paid as an actor at that 

135
00:06:55,491 --> 00:06:57,350
point or is it.
Is it.

136
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,070
Well,
he must.

137
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:58,903
He must have had a deal with the record 
company unless he released it 

138
00:07:00,411 --> 00:07:01,244
themselves.
Some people can release their stuff 

139
00:07:01,941 --> 00:07:02,774
themselves,
but I don't know.

140
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,350
This isn't live DVD.
Okay.

141
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,240
No,
but as soon as it gets to be a live DVD,

142
00:07:08,241 --> 00:07:09,074
there's two options.
One is you could pay for it all 

143
00:07:12,831 --> 00:07:13,664
yourself,
pay for the filming and then sell it to 

144
00:07:15,891 --> 00:07:16,724
whatever organization,
whether it's Netflix or what have your 

145
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,660
comedy central.
You could do it that way.

146
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:21,940
Okay.
What is this?

147
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:26,430
Both of them went platinum.
The platinum.

148
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:27,750
See,
that's,

149
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,530
that's,
that's a huge sales.

150
00:07:30,531 --> 00:07:32,550
One million,
$215,000

151
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:35,920
and 1 million.
Two hundred or 264,000

152
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:37,700
for the second one.
That's incredible.

153
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,833
Like for a,
like a standup comedian to sell that 

154
00:07:40,521 --> 00:07:42,040
many albums.
He was a real.

155
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:46,010
He bought them for that.
Oh yeah.

156
00:07:46,011 --> 00:07:47,750
That's funny.
I'm wondering what was number one?

157
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,090
Um,
I don't know.

158
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:52,590
That's a good question.
But theory,

159
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,510
US comedy number one and two.
Look,

160
00:07:56,511 --> 00:07:57,500
he's right there.
Number one,

161
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,200
but at the time the second one read 
this.

162
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,150
That's the highest I ever got was number
two.

163
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:05,060
Oh,
someone out peaked.

164
00:08:05,061 --> 00:08:10,061
Old Chart Positions.
Live audio record.

165
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,590
So that was number one on the comedy 
charts.

166
00:08:12,591 --> 00:08:15,680
It was number one period.
What the fuck would say?

167
00:08:15,681 --> 00:08:17,490
Number two,
his was number one.

168
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,270
Number four in the whole us chart 
overall.

169
00:08:20,271 --> 00:08:21,860
Wow,
that's crazy.

170
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,840
That's huge.
That's giant.

171
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,060
Um,
so that's it.

172
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:27,163
Like I didn't make shit.
I mean I made some money when I had a 

173
00:08:28,821 --> 00:08:33,821
record on warner brothers in 1999.
It was like a space monkey thing.

174
00:08:35,091 --> 00:08:35,924
No,
that was called I'm going to be dead 

175
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,270
someday.
That was my first thing.

176
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,910
And then.
And then uh,

177
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:45,970
the next one was a shiny happy jihad 
that was Uhm,

178
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:47,203
and then talking monkeys and space.
We need to get our collection for the 

179
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:53,870
road travels.
I'll hook you guys up.

180
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,150
How many albums you guys have?
No trace albums.

181
00:08:59,160 --> 00:08:59,993
Tricks,
but we just were releasing solo records 

182
00:09:01,411 --> 00:09:03,810
this year,
so it's been like a really interesting,

183
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:07,410
like we're working together and 
separately it's crazy.

184
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,513
You just keeping it together.
You get weird with each other all the 

185
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,710
time,
but yeah.

186
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:15,870
Yeah.
But that is the way it is always.

187
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,950
It's always,
possibly,

188
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:20,970
always will be.
I feel like as long as everyone's kind,

189
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:25,500
it's unavoidable and it's part of the 
process of dealing with people.

190
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,070
Well we get on each other's.
We definitely act like shit heads.

191
00:09:29,071 --> 00:09:32,970
And then we have these moments of a 
great communication.

192
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,810
That's the end goal.
But uh,

193
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,713
I think I can say that our relationship 
has made my other relationships in my 

194
00:09:40,771 --> 00:09:41,604
life so much better because you have to 
administer patients and listen and 

195
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,680
really just have a target for people,
right?

196
00:09:49,681 --> 00:09:51,120
Yeah.
Well you got to learn how to be wrong,

197
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,620
you know,
and say you're sorry when you fuck up.

198
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:54,120
Like I'm sorry I was,
I was wrong.

199
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,800
I was stupid of me.
I shouldn't have said that.

200
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,753
It's also there's a balancing act that 
some people never achieve of listening 

201
00:09:59,581 --> 00:10:00,414
to someone and thinking about what 
they're saying and then responding 

202
00:10:02,971 --> 00:10:05,310
because of that or just saying what's on
your mind.

203
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,130
Like there's this balancing act.
Sometimes you just want to say what's on

204
00:10:08,131 --> 00:10:12,690
your mind and sometimes you have to like
absorb what this person is saying to you

205
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:13,823
and then you have to respect it and 
address it and try to figure out how as 

206
00:10:16,801 --> 00:10:17,634
a person that cares about them,
what's the best way to get out what 

207
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:22,480
you're thinking.
Sometimes you don't do that.

208
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:23,883
Then you have to deal with emotions 
happening at the same goddamn which 

209
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:32,240
completely changed the way you can speak
something that I got to.

210
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:36,390
I got a great therapist,
I love her so much and she,

211
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,050
you know,
accepting people is a huge deal and just

212
00:10:40,051 --> 00:10:40,681
saying,
hey,

213
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:43,860
you and I have very different truths or 
like,

214
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:44,860
you know,
not you and I,

215
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:49,870
but for anyone and when you're arguing 
with somebody or you're in disagreement,

216
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,670
what is true to them could be completely
different to you,

217
00:10:53,671 --> 00:10:56,820
but you know the,
if you just fight that and keep fighting

218
00:10:56,821 --> 00:11:01,140
that you're going to be so fucked and,
and like there's no,

219
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:05,610
there's no piece involved in,
in that scenario.

220
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:07,580
So just like accepting your differences 
is,

221
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,770
is half the battle.
How do we relay your message to the rest

222
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:15,771
of the world and solve that problem,
the world's worlds in conflict or how to

223
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:19,770
say you're sorry,
learn how to be wrong and then,

224
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:23,820
and then listen to each other for crying
out loud.

225
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:28,830
I think that's so important.
I feel like people want to be right when

226
00:11:28,831 --> 00:11:32,370
you politics right now are just such a 
shit show.

227
00:11:32,371 --> 00:11:33,204
And if I try to stay on board,
I just get so exhausted because it's 

228
00:11:37,051 --> 00:11:39,090
never ending.
There's no,

229
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:43,080
there's no moment of,
of peace.

230
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:44,310
It's like,
okay,

231
00:11:44,311 --> 00:11:45,840
now I'm going to,
I'm going to Piss,

232
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:46,703
now you're going to piss now I'm in a 
piss and we're just going to keep 

233
00:11:48,211 --> 00:11:52,370
pissing.
And it just doesn't like I don't,

234
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:53,500
I don't,
I'm,

235
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:54,310
I'm really

236
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:56,200
annoyed with all of that.
I can't stand it.

237
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,393
Did you see what that Shit Shit.
Poster Guy Baked Alaska did what he 

238
00:12:00,401 --> 00:12:03,750
puts.
He posted a tweet that uh,

239
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
somehow he was proud that the president 
was shit posting because you know,

240
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:11,430
you know what the president did with 
trump did.

241
00:12:11,431 --> 00:12:15,580
He took that?
Me and him slamming the guy with the CNN

242
00:12:15,581 --> 00:12:20,581
had this baked Alaska guy who's like a 
famous shit poster.

243
00:12:20,801 --> 00:12:23,260
Do you know what shit posters they say,
look ridiculous shit.

244
00:12:23,261 --> 00:12:25,840
And their memes and they fuck with 
people and to get people upset.

245
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:26,923
It was pretty funny story.
I'm so honored to present his shit 

246
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,083
posting on twitter.
It really makes the world a better 

247
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:34,690
place.
Hilarious.

248
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,110
Alaska.
It's fucking funny,

249
00:12:38,111 --> 00:12:38,944
man.
He had the funniest meme about Alex 

250
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,750
Jones and I didn't know it was his and I
posted it on my instagram.

251
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:46,690
Somebody sent it to me.
I didn't know who it was and they posted

252
00:12:46,691 --> 00:12:49,420
it and then he got mad at me and he said
it was stealing jokes,

253
00:12:49,421 --> 00:12:50,254
but if I don't it was his.
It definitely would have given them 

254
00:12:51,431 --> 00:12:52,960
credit,
but the meme is hilarious.

255
00:12:52,961 --> 00:12:54,460
It's hot.
It's him in the hot tub,

256
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:55,563
but what's the one with Alex Jones in 
the hot tub when everybody wants to 

257
00:12:58,241 --> 00:12:59,440
chill,
but you're so woke.

258
00:12:59,441 --> 00:13:00,274
You can't help drop truth bombs.
It's Alex Jones in a hot tub with 

259
00:13:03,071 --> 00:13:04,030
sunglasses on.

260
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:10,030
Just such a perfect meme for Alex.
that's a real art form.

261
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:12,640
The funny meme.
It really is,

262
00:13:12,641 --> 00:13:14,260
and it's not there.
They're getting fucked.

263
00:13:14,261 --> 00:13:15,640
You want to talk about people getting 
fucked?

264
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,730
The creators of the funny meme.
I feel like there it is.

265
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,220
People try to relax,
but you're still.

266
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,360
You just have to drop another truth 
bomb.

267
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,640
Really Fun.
Glasses on.

268
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,770
I love here.
Read.

269
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,700
Oh yeah.
Well that might be a filter.

270
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:34,540
Instagram uses a lot of filters and make
you look unhealthy.

271
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:39,190
That's shaming with the meme stuff 
though.

272
00:13:39,191 --> 00:13:41,550
Now it's like if you start stealing 
people's memes,

273
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,180
you're.
You're a target.

274
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,470
You become.
Well yeah,

275
00:13:44,471 --> 00:13:46,930
but the problem is a lot of people are 
still not aware.

276
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,810
Like there's a lot of people that have 
become famous because they have websites

277
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,673
and their pages get millions and 
millions and millions of followers and 

278
00:13:52,481 --> 00:13:53,870
all they're doing is stealing people's 
feelings.

279
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:54,703
Right.
And some of them have been forced to 

280
00:13:55,931 --> 00:13:59,410
credit people and some of them just sort
of like that fat Jewish guy.

281
00:13:59,411 --> 00:14:01,240
He just sorta writes the person who 
created it.

282
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:03,600
It's name in the,
the,

283
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,170
the big trouble trouble.
Yeah.

284
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,053
He got caught.
But I mean this is what West you don't 

285
00:14:10,271 --> 00:14:11,550
in my book,
but it's the,

286
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,900
it's the wild west.
I mean,

287
00:14:13,901 --> 00:14:17,320
that's what it is.
It's like no one knew how.

288
00:14:17,321 --> 00:14:19,900
I mean if you send me something and it's
really hilarious,

289
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,060
you know?
And then like Eddie,

290
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:24,670
Eddie Bravo just sent me one on bill 
cosby.

291
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,630
I don't think I could share it.
It's fucked up enough.

292
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,460
I could show it to you,
but he sends it to me.

293
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:31,733
Ha.
I don't know who the fuck came up with 

294
00:14:33,101 --> 00:14:33,934
it.
You know,

295
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:37,000
it says you when you realize building a 
wall,

296
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:40,890
fucks your quail food supply.
Oh my God.

297
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:46,110
I don't know.
He might've.

298
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:47,740
I don't know.
I have no idea.

299
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,560
Eddie does a lot of funny shit.
He might've made that himself.

300
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:52,010
But um,
I don't know who

301
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:52,910
made that,
you know what I mean?

302
00:14:52,911 --> 00:14:54,650
So like when something like that 
happens,

303
00:14:54,651 --> 00:14:56,510
he sends it to me.
I might send it to Jamie.

304
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,900
Jamie sent it to Brendan.
Well,

305
00:14:57,901 --> 00:15:02,480
when you make it.
Oh No,

306
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:05,690
he might've been.
It might've made.

307
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:08,110
That's my dreams,
but I'm,

308
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,793
the point is like how dare you,
how does someone mean so easy to make 

309
00:15:12,951 --> 00:15:14,780
one of those.
But it's a really funny joke.

310
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,900
Kind of someone like claim that there's 
going to be like,

311
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:22,130
can you Kinda like a watermark or like,
that seems annoying though.

312
00:15:22,131 --> 00:15:25,520
These are all the citizens,
but if you like,

313
00:15:25,521 --> 00:15:26,354
if you like,
if you ben had a instagram page and you 

314
00:15:28,971 --> 00:15:31,550
started putting up those memes,
people steal them.

315
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:34,070
But if you've made your,
if you just decided,

316
00:15:34,071 --> 00:15:34,904
you know what,
between as an exercise in between 

317
00:15:36,441 --> 00:15:38,470
writing songs,
I want to write some fucking joke man,

318
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,240
for a little bit.
Just to ground.

319
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:41,820
Yeah,
I don't.

320
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,260
I guess I just let it go.
I think I'd struggle with that.

321
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,970
That's a tough one.
Be An issue,

322
00:15:46,971 --> 00:15:47,541
right?
You'd be like,

323
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:50,540
these motherfuckers already cooperating 
other people's images anyway,

324
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:53,300
and a lot of the time your phrases and 
stuff like that.

325
00:15:53,301 --> 00:15:54,134
It's almost like collage when you got in
that little battle with a battle over 

326
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,380
what mark man by the way will argue with
his own mom.

327
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
What happened?
He said something about.

328
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:10,810
He said,
I don't know why they picked me off.

329
00:16:10,811 --> 00:16:12,030
He said memes are,
are,

330
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,253
are,
are the kids who are about cultures of 

331
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,833
vegetation saturates.
And I kind of send them this deep 

332
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:21,783
breath.
You don't know because I was also 

333
00:16:23,721 --> 00:16:24,554
reading this other shit though.
I don't think you know exactly what it 

334
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:28,124
means.
Sorry.

335
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,440
I jumped in.
Do it,

336
00:16:30,441 --> 00:16:31,550
take it home.
What did you say?

337
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:32,773
No,
he said I sent back kind of like a 

338
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:34,933
similarly bitchy thing because I was 
reading about memes in a different 

339
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:38,414
context.
I was like,

340
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:39,620
yes,
actually dealt with memes,

341
00:16:39,621 --> 00:16:41,420
beans all the time,
mark,

342
00:16:41,421 --> 00:16:43,160
and he was like,
I knew exactly what it means,

343
00:16:43,161 --> 00:16:43,791
and I was like,
fuck,

344
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:45,890
that's really funny thing.
But then he went on,

345
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:48,100
it kind of drove it home.
He called me a poetry.

346
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:56,210
I was narrow minded minded because you 
don't agree with his assessment of memes

347
00:16:56,781 --> 00:16:59,480
because I went back at him.
I don't know what that means.

348
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:02,930
Narrow my friends and being like,
hey honey,

349
00:17:02,931 --> 00:17:03,770
no,
you're great.

350
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:04,723
That was a great moment because Vernon 
Reid from sprinkled in living color 

351
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,660
chimed in and stood up and he was my 
knight in shining.

352
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:14,190
I think we as human beings have to 
resist names of the cancer cells,

353
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,640
the cultural imagination.
Oh God.

354
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:17,803
And by the way,
you know what I hate about it the most 

355
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,570
no capital letter.
No period.

356
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:23,990
No,
can't do that.

357
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:28,520
We were on tour when it's cool man.
But sorry,

358
00:17:28,521 --> 00:17:30,410
but you're wrong.
So I like,

359
00:17:30,411 --> 00:17:33,610
I definitely can't claim any victory.
Pull over.

360
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,750
We had to pull over so we could figure 
out what to do.

361
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:37,463
We'll have a cigarette holder if you're 
writing that should have a black 

362
00:17:40,251 --> 00:17:42,020
turtleneck and a cigarette holder.

363
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,473
No Bull Shit.
Listening to you should be listening to 

364
00:17:47,361 --> 00:17:50,970
jazz if you wrote that.
Nothing to chance is great,

365
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,130
but there's some people that listen to 
jazz just so people know.

366
00:17:53,131 --> 00:17:55,290
They're listening to jazz.
Know that guy.

367
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:59,970
You know that guy.
So I just remembered there's this great.

368
00:17:59,971 --> 00:18:00,804
You said Little Richard and Jimi Hendrix
before Jimi Hendrix was in little 

369
00:18:03,751 --> 00:18:05,150
Richard's band.
Do you know that?

370
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,930
Oh yeah.
I forgot about before he was.

371
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:07,710
Oh,
you know what?

372
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:08,543
He was this great [inaudible] interview 
with Little Richard talking about Jimi 

373
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:14,970
Hendrix.
Just high as a kite.

374
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,300
It's amazing.
And also,

375
00:18:18,301 --> 00:18:22,650
how about Jerry Lee Lewis?
Jerry Lee Lewis fucking killed.

376
00:18:22,651 --> 00:18:27,651
How many wives?
He said he made my toe go up my boot.

377
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:30,870
What heroin?

378
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,760
My Body.
The only property.

379
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,673
Ms.
Some people haven't been put the dip by 

380
00:18:36,061 --> 00:18:36,894
and pull back on the.

381
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:41,420
She's just a little.
Richard's amazing.

382
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,133
You got to be placed into the dipper and
pulled back down on the world and then 

383
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,400
men would see your good works and 
glorify God.

384
00:18:50,401 --> 00:18:51,234
Jehovah,

385
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,550
Jimi Hendrix could play that rock and 
roll,

386
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:56,693
be singing rock and get them to be gone 
and he had that thing just romping and 

387
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:05,800
dumping all up under my toes at times.
He

388
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,810
used to make my big toe shoot up in a 
boot.

389
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,833
So good.
He gave it all to you and that's what 

390
00:19:14,201 --> 00:19:16,490
you want.
You want it all or none,

391
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:17,483
but pause this right here and to go on.
He didn't aspire to just be so fucking 

392
00:19:24,101 --> 00:19:27,050
fabulous that you are undeniable.
And Freddie Mercury.

393
00:19:27,051 --> 00:19:27,884
We were talking about him earlier.
Have you seen those mid seventies shit 

394
00:19:30,281 --> 00:19:32,300
and it blows my mind because the dude 
isn't.

395
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,333
He looks like Lord Far Quad,
but if that means anything to anybody 

396
00:19:36,311 --> 00:19:37,144
but he but he's tall and he's got to 
skin tight white suit and his mid 

397
00:19:40,181 --> 00:19:43,350
seventies and he's gay and his Dick is 
just like boom.

398
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,850
Like you could just see his.
If you did that,

399
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:48,700
now you'd be done.
You can't do that.

400
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:53,980
Can know who is up on stage with their 
dick hanging out and it was literally,

401
00:19:55,511 --> 00:19:56,021
you're just like,
oh,

402
00:19:56,021 --> 00:19:56,530
there's this day.

403
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,900
Know like outside of his pants,
you're saying,

404
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:01,570
no,
you're doing a good job.

405
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,760
Clearly presented here.
Let me clear this up.

406
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:09,270
It doesn't need to be outside of a 
transparent material stuck.

407
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,610
If,
if Justin timberlake did that,

408
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:16,180
it would be.
Just didn't do it.

409
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:19,570
See what happens.
Get those feet moving fast.

410
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:24,100
Some of us want to know that it was so 
different than that.

411
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:29,130
People were somehow except pantyhose.
Like what is he got this like skin tight

412
00:20:29,381 --> 00:20:30,460
body suit.
Right?

413
00:20:30,461 --> 00:20:31,690
And what color is it?
White.

414
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,470
But how did it make you feel?
Your wife?

415
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,830
I was with.
So you're looking at his dick,

416
00:20:35,831 --> 00:20:37,810
like as if he was wearing tight 
underwear,

417
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,490
right?
It's beyond that.

418
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:45,140
You know what I'm saying about like what
about stuff like that?

419
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:46,623
Like what movie about people stripping.
This is a live concert in front of 

420
00:20:50,411 --> 00:20:52,030
people.
Anybody can fucking go.

421
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:55,720
And the dude's just like Bam.
It just shocked me,

422
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:56,583
Michelle and inspired.
Do you remember those old led Zeppelin 

423
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:02,440
record released this fall?
Remember those old,

424
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:08,300
those old led Zepplin pictures where he 
would have his hard tucked up on side of

425
00:21:08,621 --> 00:21:12,970
his leg work.
You can't lie about that.

426
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,340
You can't fake that.
Everybody would know.

427
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,750
Yeah,
but when you wear underwear,

428
00:21:16,751 --> 00:21:19,540
he doesn't show it that and he probably 
got hard before the photo.

429
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:24,580
While you're young and of itself,
let alone an angel.

430
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:27,760
If you just put a rubber band around 
your cock and balls,

431
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:28,893
go on and do it like that's insane.
That looks like that looks 

432
00:21:33,101 --> 00:21:35,090
uncomfortable.
Definitely was.

433
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:40,750
Definitely was you walk cock out.
Look at the one.

434
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:41,770
The white there.
Yeah,

435
00:21:41,771 --> 00:21:42,950
he's Juba.
Jesus Christ.

436
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:45,340
So imagine that.
Imagine that.

437
00:21:45,341 --> 00:21:50,341
But if you could see the outline there,
that'd be Freddie Mercury.

438
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,373
Then you know it's real.
Maybe all your problem put his dick to 

439
00:21:56,081 --> 00:22:00,010
the right and one way you can't really 
change it.

440
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,040
Right?
What?

441
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:05,470
I'm right handed offensive.
You don't even have a penis.

442
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:08,680
You're offending me.
Want to know.

443
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,373
Show up.
If you were a girl and we were talking 

444
00:22:14,081 --> 00:22:15,640
about your vagina,
it would be really gross,

445
00:22:15,641 --> 00:22:19,420
right?
We'd be like ask questions when you want

446
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:23,530
to know,
which is just right down the middle.

447
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:27,693
Symmetrical.
Every Robert Plant one is dick swinging 

448
00:22:30,401 --> 00:22:33,070
to the left.
Maybe it's that big.

449
00:22:33,071 --> 00:22:33,904
He's got to Tuck it in a leg.
He's got to choose a leg and he's just 

450
00:22:36,581 --> 00:22:39,310
gotten comfortable.
He's got like a groove on the left side.

451
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:41,160
Toxins,
if you,

452
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,080
if you position yourself on stage a 
certain way,

453
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:46,060
and I mean you guys all have dicks,
right?

454
00:22:46,061 --> 00:22:46,894
So you don't allegedly,
but you don't wear pants is Robert 

455
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,150
Plant.
So check me out.

456
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:55,020
Look at this.
What is going on here?

457
00:22:55,021 --> 00:22:57,480
He's got his pants down.
Is that a scrotum?

458
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,620
It says Robert's last stand.
What is it?

459
00:22:59,621 --> 00:23:01,350
Is that a real photo?
I don't think so.

460
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:02,243
That's a real blank one.
And then there was the real one that's 

461
00:23:06,371 --> 00:23:08,320
attached to it.
Encyclopedia Britannica.

462
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,393
Is that a real cover on that one?
You actually see his dick because I 

463
00:23:12,381 --> 00:23:16,690
would say the implication that I have 
these moments when we're podcasting,

464
00:23:16,691 --> 00:23:17,231
where I'm like,
God,

465
00:23:17,231 --> 00:23:19,430
I hope my parents never listen to this.
They might,

466
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,000
they might really be into it.
I don't know.

467
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:23,140
What do you think then?
Well,

468
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,033
here's the thing.
I've been going through things with my 

469
00:23:25,511 --> 00:23:26,344
mom.
We don't really know each other that 

470
00:23:27,011 --> 00:23:29,990
well.
It's the truth and I feel like this.

471
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,170
She would learn a lot about me and my 
life.

472
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,860
Oh my God,
that's heavy.

473
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,560
That's a lot.
Should we send it to her?

474
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:36,910
Definitely not.
No,

475
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:40,420
I think she could handle it.
That would be freaked out.

476
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:42,070
Sorry,
mom.

477
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,000
It's okay.
She,

478
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:46,190
she's a delicate person whenever.
I mean especially

479
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:47,270
in this day and age,
whenever.

480
00:23:47,271 --> 00:23:48,104
Do you ever chance to sit and talk to 
someone for three hours straight like 

481
00:23:50,541 --> 00:23:51,470
this?
It's rare.

482
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:52,783
This is sort of the cure for what ails 
us when it comes to communicating like 

483
00:23:56,091 --> 00:23:56,924
podcast because there's.
It's so informal and it's really just 

484
00:24:00,051 --> 00:24:00,884
like sitting down talking,
which is what a lot of us don't ever 

485
00:24:03,621 --> 00:24:04,454
have the chance to do anymore.
Everyone is always doing a million 

486
00:24:05,871 --> 00:24:07,130
things.
You're always looking at your phone.

487
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:10,160
You're always about to go somewhere.
You got to meeting gotta this,

488
00:24:10,161 --> 00:24:10,994
you gotta that.
When the fuck do you ever get three 

489
00:24:11,781 --> 00:24:12,614
hours?
Just sit to just sit and chill thing it 

490
00:24:16,461 --> 00:24:17,294
is and it seems to be here,
but isn't it crazy that just talking is 

491
00:24:20,991 --> 00:24:25,610
a special thing that shows you how weird
we are right now as human beings,

492
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,930
as an organism that grew up in a social 
environment.

493
00:24:29,931 --> 00:24:30,764
I mean every,
every person that survives that's alive 

494
00:24:33,891 --> 00:24:38,420
today comes from a history of people 
that were in tribes were in these little

495
00:24:38,421 --> 00:24:41,840
groups of people and social interaction 
was everything.

496
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:45,290
But you had to know each show was being 
alone and that doesn't happen very often

497
00:24:45,291 --> 00:24:46,580
either when people.
Well,

498
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,200
I mean someone's Moody.

499
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,780
Come on.
No,

500
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:55,710
but you're talking about like devices 
couldn't help myself.

501
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:00,930
I love you but your niche.
But it's true.

502
00:25:00,931 --> 00:25:03,570
Like we know you're right.
We're always so busy.

503
00:25:03,571 --> 00:25:07,320
There's always shit going on and like I 
definitely have these moments where like

504
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,423
I wasn't just sitting not talking to 
someone or looking at my phone like I 

505
00:25:11,491 --> 00:25:14,190
can't remember when I wasn't just 
moving,

506
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:16,080
you know,
and not even meditating.

507
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:17,220
Just sitting.

508
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:18,243
I've become super aware lease over the 
last year that there's a lot of wasted 

509
00:25:22,361 --> 00:25:26,100
time in looking at devices and computers
like I've.

510
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:30,010
I've been real aware of it to the point 
where I had a way my bend,

511
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:33,160
the benefits of it are the benefits are 
pretty numerous.

512
00:25:33,161 --> 00:25:33,994
Like I get a lot of really interesting 
articles off of social media and really 

513
00:25:36,911 --> 00:25:37,744
interesting articles that I find online 
and really interesting up to date 

514
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:44,830
information about space and science.
That's very,

515
00:25:44,831 --> 00:25:48,340
very valuable to me,
but then there's also a lot of scrolling

516
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:49,673
constantly.
It's equally as fruitful as it is 

517
00:25:51,311 --> 00:25:52,144
beguiling because you'll get fucked up 
and lost in it and like I wanted to 

518
00:25:55,451 --> 00:25:59,200
invent this app that I think someone 
probably already did it,

519
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:00,063
but that puts a lock on your social 
media so you only get like 20 minutes a 

520
00:26:03,191 --> 00:26:06,040
day and once it's done it's done.
They have those.

521
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:07,570
Yeah.
I mean I don't want it.

522
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:10,990
You just want to develop some,
but it's also crucial for our careers,

523
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:14,260
like it's crucial to your.
Your thing is built on social.

524
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:15,990
Yes.
It's crazy.

525
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,980
The thing is though,
you'd need time alone where your board,

526
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,900
this is what I believe,
read a book.

527
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:22,883
I think you need time to just be able to
sit and think about something or do 

528
00:26:25,711 --> 00:26:28,260
something like practice something when 
you're like,

529
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:29,880
I'm sure you guys are like this with 
music,

530
00:26:29,881 --> 00:26:30,714
right?
Where you don't practice or I'm really 

531
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:36,340
envious of his discipline.
He practices his guitar every day.

532
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:37,531
I'm.
Yeah,

533
00:26:37,531 --> 00:26:39,150
you got to.
It's like meditation.

534
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:40,500
It's the same thing.
Yeah.

535
00:26:40,501 --> 00:26:43,770
I think that there's something to that 
for that.

536
00:26:43,771 --> 00:26:43,980
Some

537
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:44,813
people don't experience you put your 
phone over there or shut it off or put 

538
00:26:47,841 --> 00:26:50,770
an airplane mode and just do your thing.
You know?

539
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,570
We know what's crazy about the practices
when you can separate,

540
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:55,404
because it's tough because I'll have 
devices on my phone that helped me 

541
00:26:58,171 --> 00:26:59,004
practice.
I'll metronomes and being this stuff's 

542
00:27:01,651 --> 00:27:06,651
going up and the difference between when
I don't have my phone,

543
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:09,810
when I'm not communicating with the 
social media world of texting,

544
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:11,940
whatever,
and when I do,

545
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,730
it's insane.
In 20 minutes it's like working out.

546
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:15,653
If you focus for 20 minutes,
it's going to replace three hours of 

547
00:27:18,781 --> 00:27:20,910
shitty working out.
Am I right about that?

548
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:22,140
Yeah,
for sure.

549
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,520
Yeah.
It's all about how much,

550
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:26,400
how deep you can go in,
you know,

551
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,190
just a cognitively.
But,

552
00:27:29,191 --> 00:27:30,660
and,
and I think in general,

553
00:27:30,661 --> 00:27:31,494
people were like coming to grips with 
this now as I Connecticut because we 

554
00:27:34,681 --> 00:27:36,720
didn't fucking 10 years ago,
none of this stuff existed.

555
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:37,554
This is like fresh out the gate.
So we're trying to figure this out and 

556
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,080
there's this dude.
You just see people paying more and more

557
00:27:43,081 --> 00:27:43,914
attention.
Exactly what you're saying is this guy 

558
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:48,720
that wrote a book called deep work and 
it's going viral.

559
00:27:48,721 --> 00:27:49,554
People are paying attention to this 
guy's ideas that are exactly what we're 

560
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:52,044
talking about.
You need to shut off social media 

561
00:27:53,581 --> 00:27:54,810
advice,
you know,

562
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:56,690
stuff input,
um,

563
00:27:57,090 --> 00:28:02,090
and allow your brain to sink down deep.
And that's where real value comes from,

564
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,060
right?

565
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:04,893
The only way to access simple real value
where people don't even realize how it 

566
00:28:08,291 --> 00:28:10,780
will take over your life in your 
relationships.

567
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,740
Well,
it's new.

568
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:14,650
It's too new.
It's.

569
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:19,480
So what is it like?
Shut up 1994 is the internet.

570
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:20,493
Right.
That's like the main spread of the 

571
00:28:21,911 --> 00:28:24,290
Internet.
Now remember when we had this,

572
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:25,560
you know,
uh,

573
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,880
and it was like be,
it was electric.

574
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:30,550
It wasn't email yet either.
It was just like,

575
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:33,040
what do you understand that this is only
like 10 years old.

576
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,333
That was with the iphones versus what?
Didn't they just go through the 10th 

577
00:28:37,481 --> 00:28:39,280
anniversary of the iphone?
That's when it started.

578
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:40,720
Yeah.
Before that there were no apps.

579
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,040
Okay.
So there's no apps,

580
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:44,920
there's no twitter,
no facebook on your phone.

581
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:48,440
The snake game where it goes,
it like you,

582
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:52,150
you just had arrows and this and you had
to get the snake through this maze.

583
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:54,130
Games?
No,

584
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:55,750
it was a thing.
Joe,

585
00:28:55,751 --> 00:28:57,310
you really missed out.
Okay.

586
00:28:57,311 --> 00:28:59,750
I'm sorry to tell you.
What was it called here?

587
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,370
Ten years.
Barter.

588
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,170
Barter.
Yeah.

589
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:06,430
Jamie,
if you find that I swear to God,

590
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,700
you're like,
oh my God.

591
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:10,240
It was a,
it was a thing.

592
00:29:10,241 --> 00:29:10,811
Oh my God.
Well,

593
00:29:10,811 --> 00:29:12,910
we did our first round motor.
It has been a thing with us,

594
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:13,773
with us.
Puzzle are you take this little 

595
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:18,130
character and you propel him with his 
own farts,

596
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:21,760
with your space bar and your arrows and 
you think it sounds stupid,

597
00:29:21,761 --> 00:29:24,010
but you play your first game and you're 
just laughing.

598
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:25,173
I love Neil degrasse Tyson and then he 
has us talking about how you live your 

599
00:29:31,481 --> 00:29:32,314
truth.
This is actually something that brought 

600
00:29:35,081 --> 00:29:37,690
us a lot of joy to start demo level.
Seems like you play.

601
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:39,490
Did you play it online?

602
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:40,151
Get it,
get it,

603
00:29:40,151 --> 00:29:40,511
get it,
get it.

604
00:29:40,511 --> 00:29:41,980
Yet it got to get

605
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,960
some sound.
Listen,

606
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:45,853
I'm going to play puzzle Florida.
Jamie's going to operate the controls 

607
00:29:49,241 --> 00:29:54,241
and play puzzle for one day.
Challenge yourself a lot of fun.

608
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,440
I just don't think people.
Yeah,

609
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,313
used to the idea of being alone anymore 
without these devices and that's only 

610
00:30:01,721 --> 00:30:02,740
been around for 10 years.

611
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:07,690
It's a lot of false comfort,
but I think there's also like,

612
00:30:07,691 --> 00:30:11,320
there's all these different disorders 
and things that they're coming up with,

613
00:30:11,321 --> 00:30:12,154
like you know,
young kids and their identity with 

614
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,033
instagram and how it reflects their self
worth and how many likes they get and 

615
00:30:18,011 --> 00:30:20,170
who liked their photos and like,
it's really scary.

616
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:22,420
It's really until today where they were 
saying

617
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,333
the girls as early as nine years old and
then surgery to make their vaginas look 

618
00:30:26,621 --> 00:30:29,100
better.
That's not true.

619
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:31,470
Yes.
Really might have be making it up.

620
00:30:31,471 --> 00:30:32,304
Just so talk.

621
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:33,143
Yeah.
I don't think it's in the daily mail so 

622
00:30:37,681 --> 00:30:40,390
it might be questionable,
but as parents what?

623
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:41,413
But I know that vagina surgeries like,
like aesthetic vagina surgeries are on 

624
00:30:46,351 --> 00:30:47,550
the rise.
Really?

625
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,190
Yeah.
I mean they didn't exist.

626
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:53,770
There was a trend when you would die 
your pubes blue and put a be dazzled.

627
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,500
Just,
you know,

628
00:30:56,501 --> 00:31:01,501
trying to surgery.
It's much talking about the same pipe.

629
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:07,020
This is the BBC guys.
Come on,

630
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,290
that can't be right.
No,

631
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:13,050
but that headline,
vaginal surgery sought by girls as young

632
00:31:13,051 --> 00:31:13,710
as nine.
Let me.

633
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:15,510
Vagina is a crazy looking.
Okay,

634
00:31:15,511 --> 00:31:16,860
but how.
Okay,

635
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:20,980
here's the thing,
people get weird.

636
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:23,010
You're right,
but it's a lot harder to discriminate.

637
00:31:23,011 --> 00:31:27,630
Sorry to interrupt you,
but I beg to differ to operate on a dick

638
00:31:27,631 --> 00:31:28,590
than a vagina.
I don't fuck it.

639
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:32,580
I'm talking about are we really making 
judgment calls here and what's more.

640
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,510
I really hope your mom doesn't listen to
one of these things that we know nothing

641
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,710
about is more difficult operating on 
body parts.

642
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:42,910
Um,
how do you know like this

643
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,110
man,
like cnn just got busted for they get,

644
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:50,600
they fired a bunch of people for writing
some story about trump and Russia.

645
00:31:50,601 --> 00:31:52,160
That wasn't true.
You hear about that.

646
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,333
People get like super over zealous 
trying to make a story real when they 

647
00:31:57,801 --> 00:32:00,530
didn't do like all the background work 
that was necessary.

648
00:32:00,531 --> 00:32:01,364
And people go,
I think that's why trump can get away 

649
00:32:02,721 --> 00:32:04,730
with calling cnn fake news,
right?

650
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:08,030
Because they're doing children's,
whether they're doing desperado shit,

651
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:08,893
they're getting into that blurry area 
where they're doing things that are a 

652
00:32:12,061 --> 00:32:15,110
little bit sensational,
a little sensationalism,

653
00:32:15,111 --> 00:32:17,490
and they're trying to get people to pay 
attention and the pedal.

654
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:20,410
We know that that's not the case here.
Like when you see somebody,

655
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:23,690
I'm sure women are getting vagina 
surgeries,

656
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:25,910
we've heard of it,
we know it's a real thing.

657
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,220
So,
but when you see as early as nine,

658
00:32:28,221 --> 00:32:31,490
like manifests an instant click bait 
like that,

659
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:32,324
proud saying as young as nine that might
be worth fucking hundreds of thousands 

660
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:37,610
of dollars.
Sure.

661
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:38,270
I mean,
I don't know.

662
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:40,010
I'm just kidding.
There's one case of

663
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:40,843
this,
they could point to that as a reference 

664
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:45,710
and we'll see.
I absurdity of a young child,

665
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:46,760
uh,
someone,

666
00:32:46,761 --> 00:32:51,761
anyone like looking at their vagina in 
any kind of pleasurable way,

667
00:32:52,831 --> 00:32:53,664
it's totally fucked up.
So why would a kid care about the 

668
00:32:55,701 --> 00:32:57,350
appearance of their vagina?
Do you know what I mean?

669
00:32:57,351 --> 00:32:58,700
Like none of this makes sense.
Well,

670
00:32:58,701 --> 00:32:59,660
exactly.
I mean,

671
00:32:59,661 --> 00:33:00,494
what's even creepier as you cut baby 
degree to make them look better for 

672
00:33:03,801 --> 00:33:06,000
Jesus.
I did that for Jews.

673
00:33:06,001 --> 00:33:10,100
This dude chooses not to be too 
vulnerable here.

674
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,421
The other day,
I,

675
00:33:11,421 --> 00:33:13,790
for the first time in my life,
saw my circumcision scar.

676
00:33:13,791 --> 00:33:14,780
I was like,
Holy Shit.

677
00:33:14,781 --> 00:33:17,180
That's what that is.
How did it make you feel?

678
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:18,680
It was intense,
I was like,

679
00:33:18,681 --> 00:33:19,514
someone cut my dick off doing it right 
now a little bit as we're talking about 

680
00:33:24,051 --> 00:33:24,884
are cut and baby now with this contract,
17 to just slice and baby Dick's for no 

681
00:33:29,631 --> 00:33:30,020
reason.

682
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:30,853
So many things I want to say and I just 
want to keep them to myself at this 

683
00:33:32,601 --> 00:33:35,300
point because I should.
Well,

684
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:36,183
if you want to Sam,
I feel like you don't want to keep them 

685
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:40,760
do so I'm going to.
Is it about.

686
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:46,350
Is it about baby dicks?
Are circumcised unser?

687
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:49,030
What else is going on guys?
How's that?

688
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,670
That's fine.
You don't have to go.

689
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,870
I know where you're going.
You don't have to say a word,

690
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:59,320
but to turn it over it's an aesthetic 
thing,

691
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:00,663
but just because you're used to it yet.
This is being broadcast and we're not 

692
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:04,560
just hanging out,
stopped talking,

693
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,520
and then we would not have to think 
about it over and over.

694
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:12,290
Just going to focus on my joe action 
figure.

695
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,900
I mean how many,
how much?

696
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:18,650
If a BBC news article like that probably
gets like a million hits,

697
00:34:18,651 --> 00:34:18,920
right?

698
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:22,880
Am I being maybe a lot of hits,
right.

699
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,193
So how much is that worth?
Like if you can guarantee 50 percent 

700
00:34:27,411 --> 00:34:31,220
more worth thousands of dollars.
Like how much do they get?

701
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:34,400
They get paid by the ads that are on 
their website,

702
00:34:34,401 --> 00:34:37,240
right on the computer and I'm like,
you know,

703
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:39,080
looking at something and then there's 
those,

704
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:41,420
you know,
a fi kind of things.

705
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:42,533
Oh yeah.
And I click on them because I'm curious 

706
00:34:44,661 --> 00:34:48,950
and I just feel so bad about myself.
I just feel like such a piece of shit.

707
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:51,620
Like you should be doing something 
better with your time Suzanne.

708
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:53,240
Then looking at,
you know,

709
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:54,103
the uh,
I don't know before and after pictures 

710
00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:57,770
of,
you know what I mean?

711
00:34:57,771 --> 00:35:00,920
Like who those articles are.
Like having phone sex with a robot.

712
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,633
Yeah.
It's like you never get anything out of 

713
00:35:04,521 --> 00:35:09,140
it.
Just this weird like there's no,

714
00:35:09,141 --> 00:35:11,630
there's no real,
it's not a real article.

715
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,580
Like,
like if you read like,

716
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:17,000
you know,
the 18 hot women from the eighties,

717
00:35:17,001 --> 00:35:17,834
you should see them now and you know,
and you go through them and it's like 

718
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,970
who's writing this?
Like no one is doing what,

719
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:26,780
who benefits from it.
I'm curious like just beyond the veil,

720
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:27,643
like what is the point they get to 
someone to get paid for you clicking 

721
00:35:30,201 --> 00:35:31,034
that button?
Yeah,

722
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,400
100 percent directing traffic.
I hate that,

723
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,413
but it's the same shit.
I mean like why do people buy fucking 

724
00:35:36,471 --> 00:35:38,100
Doritos?
It's the same thing,

725
00:35:38,101 --> 00:35:39,120
isn't it?
Yeah.

726
00:35:39,121 --> 00:35:44,121
What do you hate about it though?
Because I want to use my time and energy

727
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:50,180
wisely and not wasted on things like 
that because I'd rather like sit with my

728
00:35:50,911 --> 00:35:55,140
phone off and my computer off or,
or learn something that is beneficial.

729
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:57,690
I think that's just wasteful.
That's junk food.

730
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,890
It is but.

731
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:01,320
So is Doritos but doritos tastes good.
Yeah.

732
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:02,183
But they have healthy doritos goes to 
the shell is a Dorito they have that 

733
00:36:06,781 --> 00:36:07,614
one.
My favorite trip at three slash slash 

734
00:36:09,231 --> 00:36:13,680
five slash whole foods is like,
it's like a bean chip and it tastes like

735
00:36:13,681 --> 00:36:15,930
Doritos and it's,
it's not uh,

736
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:16,823
wait a minute.
What's three 65 slash whole foods in 

737
00:36:18,841 --> 00:36:20,400
Glendale,
in California,

738
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,560
in the Los Angeles.
So it's like,

739
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,530
it's like a cheaper whole foods.
It's like the brand three,

740
00:36:25,531 --> 00:36:29,160
65 when you go to whole foods,
like an outlet.

741
00:36:29,161 --> 00:36:32,880
It's an outlet for the poor kids.
I didn't know what that was.

742
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:33,820
It's for everybody.
Yeah.

743
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:36,570
Jessie out there.
It's out there to check it out,

744
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,433
give it,
you know,

745
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:39,300
take it for a spin.
So what were you saying about it?

746
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,890
No,
but they have like these,

747
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:41,783
they have these chips being Rito,
substitute tastes like Doritos and I 

748
00:36:44,611 --> 00:36:46,740
fucking love them.
They are delicious.

749
00:36:46,741 --> 00:36:50,220
You don't want thinks adorable.
Transfats are fucking terrible for you.

750
00:36:50,221 --> 00:36:51,240
Right?
They're horrible.

751
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:56,910
And the government has decided to outlaw
trans fats in two years.

752
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:02,250
Interesting.
Ruthless diarrhea.

753
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:06,180
Just shallow going dive because of 
obesity,

754
00:37:06,181 --> 00:37:08,190
because you're addicted to sucking down 
these things.

755
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:10,530
What am I going into the transplant in 
Canada,

756
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:14,550
they have their Heinz Ketchup and we 
have our Heinz Ketchup in the Canadian.

757
00:37:14,551 --> 00:37:16,800
Heinz Ketchup does not have high 
fructose corn syrup.

758
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,270
What does it have?
Sugar.

759
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:19,793
I don't know,
but it doesn't have high fructose corn 

760
00:37:20,971 --> 00:37:23,310
syrup because it's band.
It was.

761
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,100
It tasted differently and I liked it.
I'm not kidding.

762
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:27,143
I just.
I think that's interesting that like 

763
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,213
right on the other side of this border,
they have better ketchup whether they 

764
00:37:31,981 --> 00:37:34,830
have better coca cola in Mexico,
they do use cane sugar.

765
00:37:34,831 --> 00:37:37,070
That's true.
I mean,

766
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:38,790
I don't,
I don't really drink coca cola,

767
00:37:38,791 --> 00:37:39,624
but it's just interesting what the FDA 
approves in our country for the food 

768
00:37:43,171 --> 00:37:44,300
that we eat.
Fuck,

769
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:46,830
I don't give a shit.
Fuck.

770
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:47,664
All those government agencies are bunch 
of puppets when it comes to diet and 

771
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:54,660
exercise and what you're allowed to put 
in cigarettes and what you're allowed to

772
00:37:54,661 --> 00:37:55,494
put in all sorts of different drugs that
get past it is fucking bananas that 

773
00:37:59,581 --> 00:38:03,090
there were talking about Nevada just 
became legal for marijuana.

774
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:08,630
It's fucking bananas.
How it took until 2017.

775
00:38:08,641 --> 00:38:10,530
We're states finally started making 
weed,

776
00:38:10,531 --> 00:38:11,364
legal.
All people are dropping off left and 

777
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:18,270
right from opiates pills.
Like there was a study that Dr Hart.

778
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,200
Is that his name?
It's on my,

779
00:38:22,201 --> 00:38:23,610
um,
my twitter.

780
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:27,300
I tweeted it uh,
earlier today or last night,

781
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:28,400
but,
uh,

782
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:33,400
it was 93 percent of patients that have 
pain preferred cannabis over opiods.

783
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,710
Sure.
That makes sense.

784
00:38:35,711 --> 00:38:36,150
Opioids,

785
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:37,800
opioids,
opioids.

786
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,080
Opioids.
I can attest to that.

787
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:41,933
They of course,
I mean a menstrual cramps are 

788
00:38:47,081 --> 00:38:47,914
debilitating for some ladies.
I'll be honest and that's why I got my 

789
00:38:51,521 --> 00:38:56,000
weed license because it's,
it is night and day thing.

790
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,590
Well,
they feel comfortable.

791
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:00,753
They have,
they have depositories that you put in 

792
00:39:03,271 --> 00:39:04,390
your,
in your twinkle,

793
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,840
just no,
they don't get you.

794
00:39:07,841 --> 00:39:11,620
I mean they get your,
they make this warm,

795
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:12,963
wonderful feeling in your belly.
That is the antithesis of writhing in 

796
00:39:16,631 --> 00:39:18,910
pain and being out of commission for a 
day,

797
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:20,523
which happens every month.
I get one or two days where I'm just 

798
00:39:22,271 --> 00:39:23,470
down.
I'm in so much pain,

799
00:39:23,471 --> 00:39:25,690
I can't,
I can't do anything and it's awful.

800
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:26,710
Uh,
but,

801
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:31,800
but weed has been the best thing that's 
happened for that ailment.

802
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:35,080
Whereas you take Motrin and you can take
Motrin,

803
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:37,630
but it can give you a terrible song cake
because it's really bad.

804
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:38,823
It's really,
it's really bad for your liver and you 

805
00:39:40,561 --> 00:39:41,770
know,
and you're taking like,

806
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:44,940
just handfuls of mode training,
all those things.

807
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:45,761
Yeah.
It's the same thing,

808
00:39:45,761 --> 00:39:48,270
but it's nonsteroidal,
antiinflammatories.

809
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:50,350
Those things are super bad for your 
body.

810
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,840
But it's interesting that that's what 
you would,

811
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:54,063
you would take as opposed to having weed
legal in all of its different medicinal 

812
00:39:58,601 --> 00:40:01,060
facets that can help you with.
Well,

813
00:40:01,061 --> 00:40:04,330
the differences obviously there's a 
psychoactive effect is probably unwanted

814
00:40:04,331 --> 00:40:05,164
for a lot of people that take advil.
They just want to get rid of the 

815
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:07,870
headache.
They don't want to trip.

816
00:40:07,871 --> 00:40:11,620
They're fucking balls off CBDS to.
Yeah,

817
00:40:11,621 --> 00:40:12,700
they're great,
they're great.

818
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:13,863
But apparently some people take cbds and
they experienced some sort of a 

819
00:40:17,111 --> 00:40:17,944
psychoactive effect.
I've talked to quite a few people that 

820
00:40:19,541 --> 00:40:24,130
say that I don't understand that maybe 
they're getting stuff that's like weird,

821
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:25,490
probably got popped.

822
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:28,750
And I think that too.
I think some of the recipes,

823
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:32,200
like I've definitely gotten edibles that
were duds and you have to.

824
00:40:32,201 --> 00:40:32,940
It's just like,
oh,

825
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:34,330
I think they,
they miss something,

826
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,433
you know,
it's still sort of like a primitive 

827
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:37,443
market.
So I think a lot of the companies and 

828
00:40:39,341 --> 00:40:41,950
you see some of them like come in and 
come out just like boom,

829
00:40:41,951 --> 00:40:42,311
boom,
boom,

830
00:40:42,311 --> 00:40:45,100
like new restaurants didn't make it.
Um,

831
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:50,310
I think there's definitely a search for 
more reliable product in that regard,

832
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:52,040
but uh,
I'm,

833
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:53,140
we're all so,
so different.

834
00:40:53,141 --> 00:40:55,460
Like um,
I know you will react to weeds,

835
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:56,770
so different.
Terrible.

836
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,590
Yeah.
You might feel like last time we talked,

837
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:00,543
you told me not to blow up your spot,
but at one point you took a thousand 

838
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:05,770
milligrams.
Is that you have done that?

839
00:41:05,771 --> 00:41:09,430
A couple of insane.
If I take 10 milligrams I'm fucked.

840
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:11,160
Yeah.
But I can't hang with Joey.

841
00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:14,800
Joey Diaz will take a thousand and then 
they'll eat 250 more in front of you and

842
00:41:14,801 --> 00:41:15,634
let that story.
We were at Coachella and I accidentally 

843
00:41:19,511 --> 00:41:23,290
took a 25 milligram jolly rancher 
because it was a hard candy.

844
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:25,570
You don't just bite it in half.
And my friends were like,

845
00:41:25,571 --> 00:41:26,740
you took the whole thing.
And I was like,

846
00:41:26,741 --> 00:41:30,190
yeah.
And I lost my mind watching radiohead.

847
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:34,070
This is years ago and coincidentally ran
into Clark Jr and I was

848
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:34,730
like,

849
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:37,980
I was like Carrie.
And I was like,

850
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:40,800
you're fine.
Like I was like,

851
00:41:40,801 --> 00:41:40,970
okay,

852
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:43,060
just losing my mind.
And then we,

853
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:46,370
I found out he was super helpful.
But I told you that story,

854
00:41:46,371 --> 00:41:47,204
Joe,
and you were like,

855
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:48,920
fuck that.
I'd take 25 milligrams,

856
00:41:48,921 --> 00:41:50,120
go to the movies.
And I was like,

857
00:41:50,121 --> 00:41:51,620
okay,
well you are very tough.

858
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:54,920
Well this is the point is there's no 
consistency.

859
00:41:54,921 --> 00:41:55,754
Like you get your 25 milligrams and it's
also a matter of how much take and how 

860
00:41:58,761 --> 00:41:59,840
often take it.
Yeah,

861
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:01,220
I definitely didn't say it like that.

862
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:07,240
You're so cool.
You check the tape gentlemen about it,

863
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:14,330
but you like to brag about how much they
could take me included,

864
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:15,693
like pitch.
I take that whole you journey journey 

865
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:24,110
pussy.
Joey Diaz is a horrible person though.

866
00:42:24,111 --> 00:42:24,944
Joey will take these Chiba Chews and 
he'll take the ones that have 500 

867
00:42:28,791 --> 00:42:33,791
milligrams swap the package for one that
has 75 milligram to somebody.

868
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,433
He doesn't give a fuck.
And he'll laugh because he knows you're 

869
00:42:38,151 --> 00:42:40,430
going to live.
Everybody lives.

870
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:41,833
Everybody lives.
We had a friend because we had a friend 

871
00:42:43,101 --> 00:42:43,934
who said

872
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:49,520
he ate an edible and he slept for two,
for 24 hours.

873
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:53,230
We're not going to say who,
but we had a friend.

874
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:54,243
Right.
I don't remember what you're talking 

875
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:56,370
about.
It was so high,

876
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,980
you know,
you know who I'm talking about.

877
00:42:57,990 --> 00:42:58,391
No,
I don't,

878
00:42:58,391 --> 00:42:59,320
but it's all right.
Okay.

879
00:42:59,321 --> 00:43:00,154
Well a friend of yours had never had 
weed before and someone gave him an 

880
00:43:04,391 --> 00:43:08,170
edible and he slept for like 24 hours 
and woke up like an entire day later.

881
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:12,520
If you don't do it all the time,
if you're not used to it.

882
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:13,413
Yeah,
I felt more high on edibles then I have 

883
00:43:16,331 --> 00:43:19,600
like taking mushrooms,
but I didn't take that many mushrooms,

884
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:22,300
but it's a very intense psychoactive 
experience.

885
00:43:22,301 --> 00:43:24,430
When you take an edible,
it is obviously.

886
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:26,230
There's so many times,
I apologize in advance,

887
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:30,130
but your body produces something called 
11 hydroxy metabolites process.

888
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:30,993
When thc is processed by your liver,
it's five times more psychoactive than 

889
00:43:33,521 --> 00:43:34,000
thc.

890
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
It's way different drug and it's not 
psychoactive when you smoke it,

891
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:39,400
so like when you're smoking pot,
you're.

892
00:43:39,490 --> 00:43:43,000
Your body's not producing the 11 hydroxy
metabolite,

893
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:43,933
but when you process it with your liver,
your body produces this intense 

894
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:52,260
psychedelic drug like you can have when 
you eat weed and then close your eyes.

895
00:43:52,541 --> 00:43:57,250
You have some of the craziest fucking 
visuals that match up there.

896
00:43:57,251 --> 00:44:00,760
As long as you have enough,
they go up right up to everything.

897
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:03,010
They go right up to mushrooms.
They go,

898
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:05,940
you can have like these many dmt trips 
if you.

899
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,760
I smoked DMT with weed once.
It was insane.

900
00:44:10,410 --> 00:44:12,670
How about that?
It changed my life.

901
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:13,863
When did you.
It really is a couple of years ago and 

902
00:44:17,050 --> 00:44:22,050
the good friend of mine and I took one 
hit and it was like zero to 100.

903
00:44:23,651 --> 00:44:26,320
It was just like you exhale and then you
just take off.

904
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:29,380
And I mean I,
I'd never smoked dmt before and I'm very

905
00:44:29,381 --> 00:44:31,980
sensitive to wheat.
So I was high for two,

906
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:37,010
three hours was so.
And at one point I was watching,

907
00:44:37,310 --> 00:44:38,143
we were sitting on a balcony and I was 
watching the street and it flipped into 

908
00:44:41,281 --> 00:44:43,290
like negative,
like a photograph,

909
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:47,710
like the colors changed.
You smoke the DMT and.

910
00:44:47,711 --> 00:44:50,250
And how many minutes later is this 
happening?

911
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:53,070
This was in about 10 minutes.
Okay.

912
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:56,550
So that was when it was most intense.
So you kept your eyes open?

913
00:44:56,730 --> 00:44:58,470
Oh yeah.
Should I close my eyes?

914
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:00,320
Oh yeah.
Oh,

915
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:05,310
tell me how to do it.
Sounds like you took a small dose of you

916
00:45:05,311 --> 00:45:06,980
took one hit.
No,

917
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:09,180
I took a couple heads,
but my first hit,

918
00:45:09,181 --> 00:45:10,014
it was just like literally like,
it was like star wars when it just goes 

919
00:45:12,331 --> 00:45:14,040
into warp speed.
You're like,

920
00:45:14,930 --> 00:45:16,650
like it was insane.

921
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:17,483
Dante's got a weird threshold thing that
happens and it's telling me every three 

922
00:45:20,701 --> 00:45:22,950
hits in.
What happened to something about three,

923
00:45:23,370 --> 00:45:27,360
three hits in is when reality dissolves 
for most people.

924
00:45:27,361 --> 00:45:28,710
That's what they say.
Three hits.

925
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:31,920
And um,
if you took like one or two,

926
00:45:31,921 --> 00:45:34,470
you get crazy visuals.
You get weird freaky stuff.

927
00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:36,910
Oh yeah.
But you don't go to the alien dementia I

928
00:45:36,911 --> 00:45:37,531
saw.
No,

929
00:45:37,531 --> 00:45:37,861
I.
Yes,

930
00:45:37,861 --> 00:45:39,360
I did.
I totally did.

931
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:40,081
What?
You took enough.

932
00:45:40,081 --> 00:45:43,340
So did you close your eyes while you 
were there or did you have them open?

933
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:44,653
Well,
it was nighttime so I could see the 

934
00:45:46,381 --> 00:45:49,710
stars.
And at one point I went completely deaf.

935
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:51,413
All the sound just went and I was 
watching a moving street and I couldn't 

936
00:45:55,291 --> 00:45:57,360
hear anything.
It was intense.

937
00:45:57,390 --> 00:45:58,710
How high up were you?
A.

938
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:01,620
Just a couple of stories to worried 
about freaking out and trying to fly.

939
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:02,521
No,
no,

940
00:46:02,521 --> 00:46:03,030
no,
no.

941
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:04,350
I was.
I was on the,

942
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:05,303
on the ride.

943
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:08,010
Wait,
tell me more.

944
00:46:08,730 --> 00:46:09,563
Fear the big fear.
It's like someone taking a psychedelic 

945
00:46:11,850 --> 00:46:14,010
balcony.
Like Bill Hicks used to have a bit about

946
00:46:14,011 --> 00:46:16,890
that young man on acid thought he could 
fly,

947
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:19,140
you know,
left to tragically to his death.

948
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:20,400
Oh,
that's what a tragedy.

949
00:46:20,430 --> 00:46:21,870
He goes,
what a Dick still here?

950
00:46:21,871 --> 00:46:23,430
He goes,
what did he thought he could fly?

951
00:46:23,431 --> 00:46:24,960
Why did he take off from the ground 
first?

952
00:46:26,490 --> 00:46:30,090
Because we just lost a moron.
That's awful.

953
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:31,690
Oh boys,
great.

954
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:39,620
And then he had a positive drug store,
which you never do here.

955
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:42,030
Yeah,
it is interesting.

956
00:46:42,031 --> 00:46:42,864
You know,
I don't like to say that the news is 

957
00:46:43,531 --> 00:46:44,364
fake because it's not fake.
It's like they're doing the best they 

958
00:46:47,251 --> 00:46:48,084
can.
They vet themselves the best they can 

959
00:46:48,871 --> 00:46:51,810
and they definitely fuck up and 
definitely people get ambitious,

960
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:53,093
but it is kind of interesting that they 
only tell you like sanction things like 

961
00:46:57,691 --> 00:46:58,524
you're never going to see like a whole 
Fox News article on the benefits of 

962
00:47:02,881 --> 00:47:03,714
psychedelic drugs.
And how it could change your 

963
00:47:04,651 --> 00:47:05,484
consciousness,
how Suzanne smoke pot with Duncan 

964
00:47:08,431 --> 00:47:13,431
trussell with dmt laced in it.
But it could be,

965
00:47:13,921 --> 00:47:14,754
you know what I'm saying?
I mean take mushrooms with Duncan wants 

966
00:47:16,141 --> 00:47:18,000
though.
I'm sure it was amazing.

967
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:22,710
It was the first time I'd ever really 
been high on mushrooms.

968
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:28,140
I saw my grandfather.
That's intense.

969
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:29,410
Yeah,
we should talk that.

970
00:47:29,411 --> 00:47:29,980
Another time

971
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:34,980
I saw my grandfather once on weed.
I ate them that a bone in her dream.

972
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:39,820
And that dream was really intense and I 
was talking to my grandfather.

973
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:43,900
It was really weird.
Like I hadn't seen him in forever,

974
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:44,793
you know,
he died when I was who I was in my 

975
00:47:49,001 --> 00:47:51,560
twenties.
And feel real.

976
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:53,043
Oh yeah.
Do you guys spend a lot of time 

977
00:47:54,101 --> 00:47:56,020
together?
Yeah,

978
00:47:56,021 --> 00:47:56,950
we did.
Yeah,

979
00:47:56,951 --> 00:47:57,960
he was,
um,

980
00:47:58,990 --> 00:48:01,090
he used to take me fishing and stuff 
like that.

981
00:48:01,091 --> 00:48:05,550
He was a really nice guy and just,
uh,

982
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:08,260
took care of my grandmother for the 
last,

983
00:48:08,261 --> 00:48:11,020
like 12 years of her life.
She had a stroke and then he had to take

984
00:48:11,021 --> 00:48:13,870
care of her for a long time.
She had an aneurism.

985
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:15,641
Oh my God.
Yeah.

986
00:48:15,641 --> 00:48:16,474
And I lived with them at that time 
because I'd moved from Boston to New 

987
00:48:20,410 --> 00:48:22,000
York.
I never placed a stay,

988
00:48:22,330 --> 00:48:23,163
so I live with my grandfather and my 
grandmother in New Jersey and it was 

989
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:26,860
super dark time.

990
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:30,970
But how old were you?
A 24.

991
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:32,343
Somewhere around then.
And it made me realize like really 

992
00:48:35,921 --> 00:48:36,754
intensely that this life does not last 
like in then you have to really be 

993
00:48:43,331 --> 00:48:48,331
appreciative of health in your movement,
your ability to move and your ability to

994
00:48:48,341 --> 00:48:50,920
experience things.
And it just seems so.

995
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:51,993
It seems like such a given and because 
it's such a given and we get wrapped up 

996
00:48:55,121 --> 00:48:56,910
in so many different things,
it's easy,

997
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:00,520
super easy to lose touch with that to be
happy.

998
00:49:00,521 --> 00:49:01,354
Like I was talking to a really good 
friend of mine who's going through a 

999
00:49:02,861 --> 00:49:06,220
divorce and he started getting all 
bummed out about it and this and that.

1000
00:49:06,221 --> 00:49:07,180
And I was like,
look man,

1001
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:09,730
you are so lucky.
You're happy.

1002
00:49:09,731 --> 00:49:11,830
You're healthy.
You're alive.

1003
00:49:11,831 --> 00:49:14,170
You have a bunch of great friends.
Like you're going to be fine.

1004
00:49:14,230 --> 00:49:15,760
Like if this is all gonna,
be fine.

1005
00:49:15,761 --> 00:49:16,594
Like it's just like a little journey,
you're going to go through it and it's 

1006
00:49:18,221 --> 00:49:21,160
all in like how you look at it,
how you approach this journey,

1007
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:22,990
how are you going to come out of it on 
the other end,

1008
00:49:23,470 --> 00:49:24,303
but being a young guy and living with my
grandmother when she was dying and my 

1009
00:49:28,151 --> 00:49:28,984
grandfather,
we to take care of her and seeing the 

1010
00:49:30,221 --> 00:49:32,180
bolt of them like struggle.
It was,

1011
00:49:32,830 --> 00:49:35,140
it was intense.
Can I ask you a question?

1012
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:36,420
Sure.

1013
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:38,160
When you feel like,
you know,

1014
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:41,730
when you had this psychedelic experience
where you saw your grandfather like does

1015
00:49:41,731 --> 00:49:42,564
that to you,
is that like a real experience of him 

1016
00:49:47,011 --> 00:49:49,860
being somewhere else in communicating 
with you or.

1017
00:49:49,910 --> 00:49:50,743
It's probably just an ego trip.
It's probably just me thinking that I 

1018
00:49:53,631 --> 00:49:56,780
can recreate my memory,
but it was what was interesting about as

1019
00:49:56,781 --> 00:50:00,170
the memories were so intense,
there were so realistic.

1020
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:03,350
They were like my grandfather,
like he used to talk and like he used to

1021
00:50:03,351 --> 00:50:04,850
behave.
He was always a very,

1022
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:06,133
very gentle man.
A very gentle guy with a very easy way 

1023
00:50:10,701 --> 00:50:12,260
about him.
Like he was a.

1024
00:50:12,261 --> 00:50:15,740
It was a really interesting guy when he 
was like that in the dream it was,

1025
00:50:15,770 --> 00:50:18,230
he was that guy and the dream who makes 
sense to,

1026
00:50:18,231 --> 00:50:21,320
if you go through a really impactful 
time,

1027
00:50:21,321 --> 00:50:24,770
it just digs those grooves deep,
I'm sure in your brain.

1028
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:25,670
Yeah,
I'm sure.

1029
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:26,623
I'm sure.
Wow.

1030
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:27,793
And uh,
I had it once with Phil Hartman to 

1031
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:32,780
superintendents.
The Phil Hartman womb was super intense.

1032
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:36,830
It was years after he died,
like maybe more than 10.

1033
00:50:37,010 --> 00:50:37,843
And in the dream he was,
I'm sitting in a lawn chair and somehow 

1034
00:50:44,421 --> 00:50:45,254
or another he was telling me what life 
was like after his wife had killed 

1035
00:50:50,091 --> 00:50:52,370
himself or killed him and they killed 
herself.

1036
00:50:52,910 --> 00:50:53,743
It was a really intense.
And I was like somehow or another I was 

1037
00:50:57,711 --> 00:51:00,650
talking to him from this next stage of 
existence,

1038
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:01,693
but the next stage of existence,
it wasn't heaven and it wasn't the DMT 

1039
00:51:04,701 --> 00:51:06,500
dimension.
It was like a picnic.

1040
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:09,290
It was like there was a lawn and it was 
like,

1041
00:51:09,350 --> 00:51:11,390
it was like bunch of people hanging out 
and he had a.

1042
00:51:12,350 --> 00:51:15,980
It was just laughing and joking around 
and being jovial about things.

1043
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,080
And he was just talking about,
Oh yeah,

1044
00:51:18,081 --> 00:51:20,180
we talked about that,
like a human.

1045
00:51:20,181 --> 00:51:21,860
The wife after she shot him and killed 
him,

1046
00:51:21,861 --> 00:51:24,310
he was like joking around in my dream.
But yeah,

1047
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:24,600
we had that.

1048
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:26,230
We had to have a conversation about 
that.

1049
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,290
It was like,
wow.

1050
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,320
Was,
it was so crazy.

1051
00:51:30,321 --> 00:51:32,050
It was so intense because it was so 
real.

1052
00:51:32,090 --> 00:51:34,030
It was him.
And um,

1053
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:38,000
he fell backwards in his chair,
like laughing,

1054
00:51:38,350 --> 00:51:39,183
fell backwards.
Is Chair almost like a prat fall and 

1055
00:51:41,871 --> 00:51:45,260
then he was gone and then the dream was 
gone and then it just,

1056
00:51:45,290 --> 00:51:47,780
it all went away and I woke up because 
it was so intense.

1057
00:51:47,781 --> 00:51:49,820
I woke up and I was like,
whoa.

1058
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:52,220
That really felt like I was talking to 
Phil.

1059
00:51:52,490 --> 00:51:54,500
Like it didn't feel like,
just a memory.

1060
00:51:54,530 --> 00:51:56,750
It really felt like I was talking to 
Phil.

1061
00:51:57,290 --> 00:51:58,160
But again,
what is that?

1062
00:51:58,161 --> 00:51:59,990
Is that an ego trip?
Is that you imagine

1063
00:52:00,710 --> 00:52:01,990
memory stuff?
Um,

1064
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:03,390
do you,
are you all in?

1065
00:52:04,050 --> 00:52:06,480
I'm in.
I'm in because I've had experience.

1066
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:07,020
No,
I mean,

1067
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:07,853
I think there's a lot of bullshit with.
You need to be skeptical from the 

1068
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:13,710
external people that try to tell you 
stuff,

1069
00:52:14,190 --> 00:52:19,110
but I've definitely had people help me 
understand what all that shit means when

1070
00:52:19,111 --> 00:52:22,620
I've had dreams like that with my 
deceased relatives.

1071
00:52:22,621 --> 00:52:24,930
And they told me things and then they 
happened in.

1072
00:52:25,170 --> 00:52:26,220
Yeah,
it could be your ego,

1073
00:52:26,221 --> 00:52:29,220
but I like,
I don't think that makes it a less

1074
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:32,300
real though.
If it's your ego or your mind,

1075
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:33,493
you know,
creating a scenario with a loved one or 

1076
00:52:34,641 --> 00:52:35,360
whatever.
That's this.

1077
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:39,590
I don't think that's less real than the 
idea of this spirit reembody being,

1078
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:41,360
um,
you know,

1079
00:52:41,430 --> 00:52:42,560
uh,
I dunno,

1080
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:44,160
some sort of physical form or whatever.

1081
00:52:44,610 --> 00:52:46,980
I think it's both.
They're both kind of valid.

1082
00:52:47,250 --> 00:52:47,890
It's,
it's,

1083
00:52:47,890 --> 00:52:48,723
it's energy.
I think it's an exchange of energy and 

1084
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:56,480
we've definitely been in places where we
felt like not alone,

1085
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:57,581
you know,
and we,

1086
00:52:57,581 --> 00:52:58,980
and we weren't high.
We were,

1087
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:00,750
you know,
you have those moments where like,

1088
00:53:00,751 --> 00:53:01,584
your instincts and your intuition are 
like aware of external things that you 

1089
00:53:06,241 --> 00:53:09,000
can't see,
but you can feel and maybe maybe you can

1090
00:53:09,001 --> 00:53:11,520
see him.
I've seen a ghost.

1091
00:53:11,930 --> 00:53:12,890
His dress,
what you just said,

1092
00:53:12,891 --> 00:53:14,540
though,
there is a difference,

1093
00:53:14,570 --> 00:53:16,340
right?
There is a difference we can see because

1094
00:53:16,341 --> 00:53:18,140
you're one of them is your imagination 
and one of them,

1095
00:53:18,141 --> 00:53:21,140
as you're talking to a gross,
there's a huge difference because one of

1096
00:53:21,141 --> 00:53:23,180
them that means go surreal or the other 
one,

1097
00:53:23,181 --> 00:53:26,670
it just means your imagination is real,
which are absolutely a 100 percent aware

1098
00:53:26,671 --> 00:53:27,091
of,
right?

1099
00:53:27,091 --> 00:53:29,250
So we know people have ridiculous 
imaginations.

1100
00:53:29,251 --> 00:53:31,140
They dream and imagine things 
constantly.

1101
00:53:31,590 --> 00:53:34,440
So there is a big difference.
Share two of them because one of them,

1102
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:39,920
one of them gives you a view into 
mystical world that doesn't,

1103
00:53:41,310 --> 00:53:46,170
doesn't end in the eyes of science.
It doesn't seem to make sense,

1104
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:48,440
right?
It doesn't seem to want exists.

1105
00:53:48,450 --> 00:53:49,283
If there's another world where people 
can come back from the dead and talk to 

1106
00:53:51,301 --> 00:53:52,134
you and have conversations with you,
but one of the arguments that I've 

1107
00:53:54,541 --> 00:53:55,374
always used with psychedelic drugs is 
that if you feel like in a in a 

1108
00:53:59,930 --> 00:54:00,763
psychedelic experience,
you went to heaven and had a 

1109
00:54:03,751 --> 00:54:04,584
conversation with God or you went to 
another dimension and talk to the 

1110
00:54:06,781 --> 00:54:09,700
infinite wisdom that controls the,
the,

1111
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:11,700
the,
the cells of the universe.

1112
00:54:12,150 --> 00:54:16,350
If you did do that or if you took the 
drugs and felt like you did that,

1113
00:54:16,351 --> 00:54:18,990
it's the same experience.
I think that's the difference.

1114
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:20,123
It's like I don't know if God's real and
I don't know what the fuck happens when 

1115
00:54:22,061 --> 00:54:25,760
he takes psychedelic drugs,
but God damn it feels similar like it.

1116
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:26,753
There's moments where you have intent,
psychedelic trips where you really do 

1117
00:54:30,241 --> 00:54:34,770
believe you're in the presence of like 
this pure wisdom and pure love that sees

1118
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:37,780
you in a way that is undeniable.
You can't argue it.

1119
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:38,611
Wait,
I don't know.

1120
00:54:38,611 --> 00:54:39,444
I think sometimes it's your ego.
Sometimes it's some weird shit in your 

1121
00:54:41,491 --> 00:54:43,200
brain and sometimes I think it's real.
I think it's.

1122
00:54:43,350 --> 00:54:45,090
It's very complicated.

1123
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:47,830
It is complicated.
My point is the same experience.

1124
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:51,700
If you're talking to God or if you're 
talking to your imagination that creates

1125
00:54:51,701 --> 00:54:54,790
this God.
It's for that brief moment.

1126
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:56,193
In those 15 minutes.
It's the same experience and I don't 

1127
00:54:58,691 --> 00:55:01,660
know if that's enough,
but that's something like,

1128
00:55:01,661 --> 00:55:04,960
I don't know what your.
Your old time on earth is just time,

1129
00:55:04,961 --> 00:55:05,980
right?
Your time on earth.

1130
00:55:05,981 --> 00:55:07,780
It's just you have a limited finite 
amount.

1131
00:55:07,990 --> 00:55:10,480
He got 100 years.
If you're fucking super lucky guy,

1132
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:12,730
good genes and that's a wrap,
right?

1133
00:55:12,731 --> 00:55:14,710
So this is just.
We have this whole time thing,

1134
00:55:15,010 --> 00:55:18,340
but during those 15 minutes,
which is a small amount of time,

1135
00:55:18,341 --> 00:55:21,580
but the whole life small during those 15
minutes,

1136
00:55:21,850 --> 00:55:26,260
you are absolutely experiencing 
something divine.

1137
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:27,353
Now is out in your imagination,
is that you finding some portal to 

1138
00:55:31,421 --> 00:55:32,254
another dimension?
Is that the reason why your brain 

1139
00:55:34,241 --> 00:55:35,074
produces these chemicals in the first 
place is because we transitioned during 

1140
00:55:37,961 --> 00:55:40,650
the time of death into this new realm?
Is that it?

1141
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:43,360
But if he doesn't accept what divinity 
is,

1142
00:55:43,361 --> 00:55:47,170
includes all of that stuff,
he gets to be both right?

1143
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:48,373
We sure,
but I mean like there's a real problem 

1144
00:55:50,351 --> 00:55:52,780
with defining something that you just 
can't define.

1145
00:55:52,990 --> 00:55:55,330
Like the whole problem with psychedelic 
trips.

1146
00:55:55,331 --> 00:55:56,164
I don't know,
like free.

1147
00:55:56,170 --> 00:55:57,003
I don't know if you guys feel this way.
For me it's always like whenever I tell 

1148
00:55:59,711 --> 00:56:03,250
somebody about them,
like why even use words,

1149
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:04,900
like the words don't work,
right?

1150
00:56:05,310 --> 00:56:07,420
The Not enough,
you're not enough.

1151
00:56:07,421 --> 00:56:08,900
You could scramble them together and 
say,

1152
00:56:08,901 --> 00:56:09,050
okay,

1153
00:56:09,050 --> 00:56:09,883
perfect.
And screaming from the rooftops to it 

1154
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:15,220
can almost like demean the experience or
diminish.

1155
00:56:16,050 --> 00:56:16,883
Sorry.
Well that's where we're pushing against 

1156
00:56:18,411 --> 00:56:21,170
the limits of language,
you know,

1157
00:56:21,190 --> 00:56:24,220
and that's why I think there's such a 
wide

1158
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:25,083
array of people's theories and beliefs 
and thoughts and they're all valid 

1159
00:56:27,851 --> 00:56:31,270
because we don't have,
there's no agreed upon language to say,

1160
00:56:31,271 --> 00:56:32,104
okay,
this is how we all feel and this is how 

1161
00:56:32,831 --> 00:56:33,664
we're doing it.
Right?

1162
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:34,880
You know,
it's similar,

1163
00:56:35,050 --> 00:56:35,883
it's just,
I always go back to music with this 

1164
00:56:37,361 --> 00:56:38,194
stuff,
but there's a similar pathway and trend 

1165
00:56:41,111 --> 00:56:41,944
in music where people are constantly 
redefining the language of it and you 

1166
00:56:45,011 --> 00:56:46,600
know,
there's a kind of a mainstream,

1167
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:48,370
um,
openness to that are,

1168
00:56:48,371 --> 00:56:49,204
there isn't,
but the idea that the point is the 

1169
00:56:51,071 --> 00:56:52,630
language is dynamic,
you know,

1170
00:56:52,631 --> 00:56:53,464
and it goes on to continuously try and 
express something that's kind of 

1171
00:56:56,861 --> 00:56:57,694
inexpressible and that's why it acts as 
a magnet for people suck because they 

1172
00:57:01,031 --> 00:57:01,930
say,
okay,

1173
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:03,333
this is kind of our pathway of 
experimentation to understand these 

1174
00:57:07,990 --> 00:57:08,780
phenomena.

1175
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:09,613
That makes sense.
It seems like the fast food of music a 

1176
00:57:11,151 --> 00:57:11,984
little bit and then there's some more 
obscure like restaurants off the beaten 

1177
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:17,420
path that you've never tasted anything 
like that.

1178
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:19,790
And they're developing the vocabulary 
the most.

1179
00:57:19,791 --> 00:57:22,280
People like that fucking tastes gross.
I'm not eating a cricket,

1180
00:57:22,310 --> 00:57:23,540
you know what I mean?
But,

1181
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:24,523
but in 50 years,
you know that that vocabulary kind of 

1182
00:57:27,201 --> 00:57:30,020
seeps its way in if it's,
if it's value.

1183
00:57:30,230 --> 00:57:32,930
I always felt like,
I mean you guys are the musicians,

1184
00:57:32,931 --> 00:57:33,764
but I always felt like what music sort 
of is almost like a vessel that the 

1185
00:57:37,611 --> 00:57:38,444
artist filled with emotion and with like
passion and it's almost like it doesn't 

1186
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:45,590
even matter what the words are 
sometimes.

1187
00:57:45,650 --> 00:57:46,483
Sometimes it does because those words 
and the feeling behind them enhance the 

1188
00:57:48,681 --> 00:57:50,780
song.
But like Voodoo child,

1189
00:57:50,810 --> 00:57:51,643
perfect example.
Like there's like a lot of the lyrics 

1190
00:57:55,311 --> 00:57:58,160
are particularly profound.
Like the data was born.

1191
00:57:58,410 --> 00:58:01,750
Say the moon turned all the lyrics.
I just know the feeling.

1192
00:58:02,990 --> 00:58:04,430
Feel the song.
Yeah.

1193
00:58:04,431 --> 00:58:06,710
It's just about being a bad mother 
fucker.

1194
00:58:06,711 --> 00:58:08,330
I was born a bad motherfucker,
bitch.

1195
00:58:09,390 --> 00:58:10,223
He was.
He wasn't lying and argue that staring 

1196
00:58:13,311 --> 00:58:14,144
me in the eye.
They say that moving out of the night I 

1197
00:58:15,981 --> 00:58:17,810
was born.
I mean that's not profound,

1198
00:58:17,990 --> 00:58:18,823
right?
But when you hear him say it with that 

1199
00:58:21,171 --> 00:58:23,450
guitar behind it,
with those emotions,

1200
00:58:23,451 --> 00:58:25,740
it carries that song.
It's like,

1201
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:26,793
yeah,
and what's,

1202
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:29,140
what's profound is,
is the,

1203
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,110
it's part of a lineage.
You know what I mean?

1204
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:36,000
That's a proclamation and that's part of
blues music and as part of African music

1205
00:58:36,001 --> 00:58:37,480
and it's part of all this stuff.
You just like,

1206
00:58:37,630 --> 00:58:40,840
I'm a fucking man or woman or whatever.
I'm a human boom.

1207
00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:41,853
Here it is.

1208
00:58:41,970 --> 00:58:43,440
Yeah.
But it's more than that with him.

1209
00:58:43,441 --> 00:58:45,270
When he's saying he's,
he's a Voodoo child.

1210
00:58:45,271 --> 00:58:47,910
I mean he's basically claiming some 
Robert Johnson type shit.

1211
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:51,330
That night I was born,
the moon turned a fire red,

1212
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:54,330
you know?
Did he write that song?

1213
00:58:54,331 --> 00:58:55,610
Are we certain who?
Buddhist.

1214
00:58:55,620 --> 00:59:00,620
I don't know who wrote it.
Like a watch watchtower,

1215
00:59:00,661 --> 00:59:01,494
right?
That's about.

1216
00:59:01,590 --> 00:59:02,730
Yeah.
But this,

1217
00:59:02,750 --> 00:59:03,421
you know,
cause he,

1218
00:59:03,421 --> 00:59:04,320
he,
he,

1219
00:59:04,370 --> 00:59:06,980
his grandmother was a native American so
he has all this,

1220
00:59:07,050 --> 00:59:07,883
like there's two versions to this 
version that's like the real bluesy 

1221
00:59:13,501 --> 00:59:15,810
version of Voodoo child,
you know,

1222
00:59:15,811 --> 00:59:17,700
there's the Voodoo child,
slight return.

1223
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:22,800
Then there's that other version which is
much more or much more guitar driven.

1224
00:59:25,470 --> 00:59:27,620
Yeah man.
Like he,

1225
00:59:27,770 --> 00:59:30,200
like guitar sounds is a perfect example.
Uh,

1226
00:59:30,210 --> 00:59:31,043
Gary Clark Jr is a perfect example.
Like when he came and played with you 

1227
00:59:34,641 --> 00:59:37,490
guys on stage and I saw you guys 
downtown a few months back.

1228
00:59:38,090 --> 00:59:39,500
Dude,
when he gets on stage,

1229
00:59:39,590 --> 00:59:43,490
his sound is Gary Clark Jr.
But you know what I'm saying?

1230
00:59:43,850 --> 00:59:46,310
Like you guys were saying in midnight 
rider,

1231
00:59:46,311 --> 00:59:49,270
which was fucking amazing.
He just plug in.

1232
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:49,810
No,
he.

1233
00:59:49,810 --> 00:59:50,643
Yeah,
he just took my guitar playing trading 

1234
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:53,253
dude.
But that sound is like a sound that you 

1235
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:59,710
instantly,
like stevie ray vaughn had it hendricks.

1236
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:00,633
They'll get a sale.
You instantly recognize one of his 

1237
01:00:03,261 --> 01:00:05,540
riffs.
Crazy.

1238
01:00:05,570 --> 01:00:07,100
How does someone do that?
Right?

1239
01:00:07,150 --> 01:00:11,040
Because it's talking about as far as the
vocabulary to say,

1240
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:14,180
and maybe this happens in fighting.
I imagined it does,

1241
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:16,490
you know,
people have technIques or whatever,

1242
01:00:16,491 --> 01:00:18,710
that they slowly turned into their own.
Oh sure.

1243
01:00:19,190 --> 01:00:21,620
Yeah.
And that's what makes them well in their

1244
01:00:21,621 --> 01:00:24,350
derivative of a lot of things have a lot
of different techniques.

1245
01:00:24,351 --> 01:00:26,060
So then you kind of have this like,
yeah,

1246
01:00:26,550 --> 01:00:28,460
at least for music,
I'll speak for myself.

1247
01:00:28,461 --> 01:00:32,240
I just feel like I have this like garble
of stuff that just when people are like,

1248
01:00:32,241 --> 01:00:32,930
what are,
what,

1249
01:00:32,930 --> 01:00:36,350
how would you describe your sound?
It's so awkward because you're Like,

1250
01:00:36,530 --> 01:00:38,800
I sound just like that.
you know?

1251
01:00:38,820 --> 01:00:43,820
There's really can't make it sound like 
I can't do this.

1252
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:50,660
It's like,
don't ask me that question.

1253
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:52,880
What kind of,
what kind of comedy are you?

1254
01:00:52,890 --> 01:00:57,170
Joe rogen show last week where a guy 
asked me to make him laugh.

1255
01:00:57,470 --> 01:00:59,870
Oh fuck that.
I said,

1256
01:00:59,871 --> 01:01:04,871
well,
that's ridiculous.

1257
01:01:05,340 --> 01:01:07,770
So when someone calls up on the phone,
they're saying,

1258
01:01:07,771 --> 01:01:09,110
are you like,
sing me a song?

1259
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:13,370
it's really good.
Let's hear you sing.

1260
01:01:18,430 --> 01:01:19,263
it's humbling.
It's super humbling because it's like 

1261
01:01:21,140 --> 01:01:22,790
sometimes we've.
Why's it humbling?

1262
01:01:22,791 --> 01:01:24,620
You're talking to a twat?
Well,

1263
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:25,713
no,
you're talking to someone who doesn't 

1264
01:01:26,091 --> 01:01:28,330
understand why they're being a twat.
Sure.

1265
01:01:28,430 --> 01:01:29,580
But like,
I don't know.

1266
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:35,260
I feel like the need to even connect 
with the twat sometimes just say,

1267
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:36,760
hey,
yeah,

1268
01:01:36,770 --> 01:01:38,330
I'll sing for you.
If you don't like it,

1269
01:01:38,331 --> 01:01:39,860
that's fine.
I'll sing for you.

1270
01:01:39,890 --> 01:01:41,480
That's fine.
I'm not above that.

1271
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:46,980
But that was my chair.
One more time.

1272
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:58,680
I would tell you and rebecca.
That's weird.

1273
01:02:03,250 --> 01:02:05,910
That's where there's no need for 
somebody to ask that question.

1274
01:02:05,990 --> 01:02:06,770
Well,
you know,

1275
01:02:06,770 --> 01:02:07,603
it's just lazy entertaining.
It's also that job of being like the 

1276
01:02:11,031 --> 01:02:15,110
radio host is a tough fucking job.
You get three minutes to talk to someone

1277
01:02:15,111 --> 01:02:18,020
you never talked to you before and maybe
not so good at it.

1278
01:02:18,021 --> 01:02:20,160
And djs on radio stations

1279
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:22,320
nowadays,
they're not even really djs anymore.

1280
01:02:22,350 --> 01:02:24,900
They don't kit the pick the fucking 
songs.

1281
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:27,720
Who the fuck lets you pick the songs?
One dude,

1282
01:02:27,721 --> 01:02:28,554
fuck that.
There's some big daddy's out there on 

1283
01:02:32,050 --> 01:02:32,883
the radio.
There's like 10 stations across the 

1284
01:02:36,301 --> 01:02:39,950
nation that are still public radio like 
heaven and became a w.

1285
01:02:39,951 --> 01:02:41,910
Like it doesn't Jason Bentley,
like pick,

1286
01:02:41,970 --> 01:02:44,550
pick his yet.
But that's a unique thing.

1287
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:45,720
Yeah.
But that's what I'm saying.

1288
01:02:45,750 --> 01:02:47,400
But that's what I'm saying.
Like there's still some,

1289
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:48,263
some people that are holding court.
It's like game of thrones just knocking 

1290
01:02:52,230 --> 01:02:53,063
bitches out.
So I think it has to be small stations 

1291
01:02:54,991 --> 01:02:55,824
were not.
A lot of people are paying attention 

1292
01:02:56,670 --> 01:02:57,503
exactly because the big ones,
they need the money that's going to 

1293
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:03,210
dictate the platelets,
but that doesn't mean you still can't.

1294
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:06,150
If,
if that part of your job as a dj is even

1295
01:03:06,151 --> 01:03:06,984
taken away,
then what is your fucking job to be 

1296
01:03:08,461 --> 01:03:09,630
interesting on the air?

1297
01:03:09,690 --> 01:03:11,760
They can't do that.
Do you?

1298
01:03:11,761 --> 01:03:13,650
Um.
Do you know how they get ratings?

1299
01:03:13,651 --> 01:03:16,350
This is the most hilarious thing.
Or they did at least until recently,

1300
01:03:16,351 --> 01:03:19,410
they still do the arbitron shit.
Is that how they do the radio ratings?

1301
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:20,633
The way they do it as a,
they hand out books and they asked 

1302
01:03:22,951 --> 01:03:23,784
people to fill out the books.
Tell us what you were listening to and 

1303
01:03:25,471 --> 01:03:27,260
when you were listening to it.
So what you,

1304
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:28,133
what do you get?
You get the opinion of assholes that it 

1305
01:03:30,351 --> 01:03:33,690
will fucking books.
Who's going to fill out that book?

1306
01:03:33,870 --> 01:03:35,230
They're going to give you that book and 
he go,

1307
01:03:35,260 --> 01:03:36,093
what to do?
I'm not filling out this fucking radio 

1308
01:03:38,641 --> 01:03:40,240
book isn't like a sorry.
No,

1309
01:03:40,290 --> 01:03:41,123
you,
it's like our first record had a single 

1310
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:47,670
called little toy gun and they would 
that they were testing that.

1311
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:49,440
I guess maybe it's different now.
I don't know.

1312
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:52,110
They were calling people like potential 
listeners,

1313
01:03:52,111 --> 01:03:52,944
kind of like a nielsen vibe a little and
they would play them a bunch of songs 

1314
01:03:55,381 --> 01:03:55,861
and be like,
whoa,

1315
01:03:55,861 --> 01:03:56,694
what did you like it like literally over
the phone you'd hear like 20 seconds of 

1316
01:03:59,791 --> 01:04:00,624
a song and you give it a thumbs up or 
thumbs down and that's how you're 

1317
01:04:02,641 --> 01:04:05,040
getting the ratings.
That's what defines whether our song was

1318
01:04:05,041 --> 01:04:05,874
successful

1319
01:04:05,890 --> 01:04:06,810
different.
Now though,

1320
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:07,833
there's like it now,
now you've got internet radio that's 

1321
01:04:11,641 --> 01:04:14,610
free so people don't have to pay for it.
They don't have to call in,

1322
01:04:14,611 --> 01:04:17,130
they just have to listen and that is 
monitored through,

1323
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:18,030
you know,
you can,

1324
01:04:18,030 --> 01:04:22,480
you can measure that through spotify or 
pandora or apple music and like I,

1325
01:04:22,950 --> 01:04:26,810
I have a single out right now that came 
out a month ago and it's really,

1326
01:04:27,050 --> 01:04:29,320
it's doing really well.
That's called.

1327
01:04:29,590 --> 01:04:33,270
It's called ghost into my bed and it's 
doing better than I thought it would.

1328
01:04:33,271 --> 01:04:37,020
I had no idea that it would be like 
jumping from playlist two playlist.

1329
01:04:37,110 --> 01:04:38,760
I um,
this is our,

1330
01:04:38,761 --> 01:04:39,530
you know,
we're doing solo

1331
01:04:39,530 --> 01:04:41,690
projects this year.
How much of a fucking bad.

1332
01:04:44,670 --> 01:04:46,160
But I,
I looked at it,

1333
01:04:46,690 --> 01:04:50,110
it came out June 1st.
I had like a couple hundred followers on

1334
01:04:50,111 --> 01:04:53,200
spotify and like that week I got like 
10,000

1335
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:54,273
and then like,
like the other week it was at like 

1336
01:04:56,921 --> 01:04:58,450
37,000
followers.

1337
01:04:58,451 --> 01:04:59,080
I,
it,

1338
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:00,430
it,
it blew my mind and I,

1339
01:05:00,790 --> 01:05:04,810
I call,
I have a pr team that's,

1340
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:06,520
you have a team.
We've got a team.

1341
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:07,301
I've got a team.
Yeah,

1342
01:05:07,301 --> 01:05:11,890
because I want to own my music.
So I hired a publicist,

1343
01:05:12,610 --> 01:05:13,443
a distributor,
and you get your manufacturing and 

1344
01:05:15,941 --> 01:05:18,160
that's really all you need is,
is

1345
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:20,380
doing the fucking work.
Isn't that crazy?

1346
01:05:20,381 --> 01:05:24,040
To own your own shit.
You gotta hire a bunch of people because

1347
01:05:24,100 --> 01:05:26,830
record companies make you think that you
need them and you don't.

1348
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:29,470
Some of them are great too.
WHat do they do now?

1349
01:05:29,471 --> 01:05:31,540
Like what's a,
what's a record company good for today?

1350
01:05:32,350 --> 01:05:34,180
It would depends.
If they're actually good at their job,

1351
01:05:34,181 --> 01:05:35,014
they're good at a fucking selling music,
but that's very rare and that's hard to 

1352
01:05:37,541 --> 01:05:38,374
do for everybody.
It's a combination though because 

1353
01:05:41,111 --> 01:05:43,180
obviously like if the music's not good 
enough,

1354
01:05:43,181 --> 01:05:45,220
it's not gonna work.
And if it is great,

1355
01:05:45,460 --> 01:05:47,260
but there's,
there's so many different.

1356
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:49,030
Um,
you know,

1357
01:05:49,031 --> 01:05:51,370
it's a labyrinth of.
Oh no,

1358
01:05:51,430 --> 01:05:52,450
we're going to lose them.
Here we go.

1359
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:53,970
Here we go.
Ben is going to be all smiles.

1360
01:05:54,340 --> 01:05:55,173
Blake.
Cool.

1361
01:05:56,170 --> 01:05:58,330
He was great fun.
It was so funny.

1362
01:05:58,331 --> 01:05:59,164
When you start reading,
you're just say that money isn't like 

1363
01:06:01,570 --> 01:06:02,403
fun.

1364
01:06:02,690 --> 01:06:04,110
Fun.
Wait,

1365
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:06,120
is this a test?
I'm just saying we have it now.

1366
01:06:06,121 --> 01:06:07,570
It's on the internet.
You said it.

1367
01:06:09,050 --> 01:06:12,670
She said you're not funny.
We have a lot of fights on.

1368
01:06:12,671 --> 01:06:13,504
Ben gets stoned,
but I also love you and want you to be 

1369
01:06:15,401 --> 01:06:17,100
happy.
It means a lot to me.

1370
01:06:17,590 --> 01:06:18,590
This is live,
right?

1371
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:21,930
Ben's mom might wasn't there one day,
but.

1372
01:06:22,310 --> 01:06:25,220
No,
no.

1373
01:06:25,390 --> 01:06:26,223
But in terms of the,
the record companies and releasing 

1374
01:06:29,291 --> 01:06:30,280
music,
they have.

1375
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:33,490
I mean,
every artist is different.

1376
01:06:33,491 --> 01:06:34,324
Every approach is differeNt,
but I think what's interesting is 

1377
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:42,000
they're jobs are becoming more and more 
obsolete because of the evolution of the

1378
01:06:42,611 --> 01:06:43,444
industry,
but don't they try and take a piece of 

1379
01:06:44,651 --> 01:06:48,910
your music sales thing.
EverYthing in that concert sales,

1380
01:06:48,911 --> 01:06:52,270
they try to take a page.
It depends on the deal is really common,

1381
01:06:52,271 --> 01:06:54,160
right.
To take a piece of your concert sales,

1382
01:06:54,250 --> 01:06:56,500
which it seems kind of crazy.
The live music,

1383
01:06:56,650 --> 01:06:59,340
it depends on your position,
your situation.

1384
01:06:59,350 --> 01:07:03,930
Who was it that we had in what musician 
with everlast was explaining was he know

1385
01:07:04,230 --> 01:07:08,260
surely from garbage.
I listened to that and it was incredible

1386
01:07:08,261 --> 01:07:09,094
and she.
She had a lot of really interesting 

1387
01:07:10,431 --> 01:07:10,871
point.
Cool.

1388
01:07:10,871 --> 01:07:11,704
She's so cool.
She might be like one of the coolest 

1389
01:07:13,181 --> 01:07:17,790
people or garbage and a.
Is it a hole forming at the.

1390
01:07:18,060 --> 01:07:20,970
At the bowl,
the bowl,

1391
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:23,890
the documentary that.
So the courtney love killed kurt cobain.

1392
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:26,800
I'd started to wash it with my mom and 
dad.

1393
01:07:29,730 --> 01:07:31,330
There was a journal that they put out to
people,

1394
01:07:31,410 --> 01:07:32,243
reads journals with my parents bought 
the book because I was such a huge fan 

1395
01:07:37,541 --> 01:07:39,120
and I felt like shit.
I was like,

1396
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:40,033
I should not be doing this.
I don't want to read this to channels 

1397
01:07:42,310 --> 01:07:44,320
that do change the war.
That was another one.

1398
01:07:44,321 --> 01:07:46,960
Like that guy had a sound.
There was something going on,

1399
01:07:47,020 --> 01:07:48,550
you know,
when the lights out.

1400
01:07:48,551 --> 01:07:49,690
it's less dangerous.
I mean,

1401
01:07:49,691 --> 01:07:52,150
come on man.
It's not the words mean something to the

1402
01:07:52,151 --> 01:07:52,984
words,
but it's the way he's expressing those 

1403
01:07:55,331 --> 01:08:00,331
words or joe.
So what's interesting about the icons of

1404
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:02,460
the decades,
you know,

1405
01:08:02,470 --> 01:08:05,830
you get the sixties,
like come see.

1406
01:08:05,970 --> 01:08:09,160
So the fifties were like everything's 
perfect.

1407
01:08:09,190 --> 01:08:10,023
We have the cleanest music and we have a
cookie cutter home and this is the life 

1408
01:08:14,621 --> 01:08:15,960
and this is the husband.
And this was like

1409
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:19,100
the generation after world war ii of 
like,

1410
01:08:19,101 --> 01:08:21,170
everything's fine.
We're cool.

1411
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:24,290
We just came back from war.
We're going to make a lot of babies.

1412
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:24,801
Right,
okay.

1413
01:08:24,801 --> 01:08:29,801
The fifties and there's this like total 
disillusionment of oh no,

1414
01:08:29,961 --> 01:08:30,794
it was more survival I think.
But then the sixties or like people 

1415
01:08:33,590 --> 01:08:34,423
trying to feel more.
And that was when psychedelics were 

1416
01:08:36,171 --> 01:08:37,004
coming into the fifties and elvis and 
all this stuff that was up ending all 

1417
01:08:39,390 --> 01:08:41,280
this.
But he,

1418
01:08:41,290 --> 01:08:44,690
he was pioneering that though.
That was late fifties,

1419
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:46,670
right.
And then,

1420
01:08:46,700 --> 01:08:47,533
and then going into the sixties of 
people like there's this dichotomy of 

1421
01:08:50,931 --> 01:08:51,770
like,
you know,

1422
01:08:51,771 --> 01:08:52,604
the,
the people kind of experiencing other 

1423
01:08:55,281 --> 01:08:56,114
areas of life that aren't this sanitized
version of society and Blossoming more 

1424
01:09:01,490 --> 01:09:04,700
into the seventies of just like harder 
rock,

1425
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:05,650
you know,
think,

1426
01:09:05,650 --> 01:09:07,340
you know,
sonically speaking,

1427
01:09:07,341 --> 01:09:08,174
you know,
you're going into zeppelin and pink 

1428
01:09:10,881 --> 01:09:12,920
floyd and cooper,
Alice Cooper.

1429
01:09:13,820 --> 01:09:14,653
I can't.
The eighties or interesting that the 

1430
01:09:15,951 --> 01:09:16,784
glam of the eighties,
I can't really help me out with the 

1431
01:09:19,611 --> 01:09:22,580
significance of what that meant to 
people.

1432
01:09:23,330 --> 01:09:24,560
I think it was,
it was,

1433
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:25,513
it kind of went back to a little more of
this like pristine version of people in 

1434
01:09:29,841 --> 01:09:31,400
society.
I feel like,

1435
01:09:31,590 --> 01:09:32,423
well,
let me give you the clean version of 

1436
01:09:33,241 --> 01:09:34,890
what will a lot of people believe 
happened.

1437
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:36,820
Drugs became illegal.
Okay.

1438
01:09:36,821 --> 01:09:39,030
1970,
sweeping drug legislation.

1439
01:09:39,031 --> 01:09:41,190
Zach to schedule one act from Richard 
Nixon.

1440
01:09:41,610 --> 01:09:44,280
As soon as it became illegal to possess 
anything,

1441
01:09:44,281 --> 01:09:47,040
whether it's marijuana,
which is illegal for a long time.

1442
01:09:47,041 --> 01:09:47,874
Mushrooms,
it was really hard to do drugs and you 

1443
01:09:50,551 --> 01:09:51,384
just got this massive drop off in the 
creativity of music in the eighties was 

1444
01:09:55,710 --> 01:09:56,543
the anger,

1445
01:09:57,010 --> 01:09:59,950
right?
That was the product of,

1446
01:09:59,980 --> 01:10:01,330
of that disillusionment.

1447
01:10:01,540 --> 01:10:05,140
I grew up with reagan on tv and they 
didn't want plastic.

1448
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:08,920
They just wanted everything to be like 
flannel and he wanted to rain everyday.

1449
01:10:09,190 --> 01:10:10,170
People needed that

1450
01:10:10,210 --> 01:10:11,043
truth.
They needed that reality in that 

1451
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:14,310
expression of.
No,

1452
01:10:15,670 --> 01:10:16,503
I don't.
I think we need so many different 

1453
01:10:17,831 --> 01:10:22,710
things.
We always need love.

1454
01:10:22,990 --> 01:10:23,823
We always knew,
but I think right now we're So 

1455
01:10:25,900 --> 01:10:30,400
complicated and,
and in our individual rights,

1456
01:10:30,401 --> 01:10:31,990
but all,
you know,

1457
01:10:32,070 --> 01:10:34,240
I don't know what people need so many 
diffeRent things now.

1458
01:10:34,820 --> 01:10:36,660
You can't really say that it's.
I mean like,

1459
01:10:36,750 --> 01:10:37,583
I mean I'm saying,
I'm not saying you can't really say 

1460
01:10:40,391 --> 01:10:41,760
that.
I'm saying like,

1461
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:42,933
it's so hard to say people need loVe or 
people need this or people need 

1462
01:10:46,350 --> 01:10:47,183
education and people need because it's.
You can't really say that there's any 

1463
01:10:51,581 --> 01:10:55,420
one group of people.
There's so many groups of people,

1464
01:10:55,780 --> 01:10:56,740
but I do think mean

1465
01:10:57,230 --> 01:11:02,230
it doesn't get pulled out of the.
Just the spiraling of the phones and the

1466
01:11:03,471 --> 01:11:04,304
stuff for social media and I think the 
only things that get them out of that 

1467
01:11:07,550 --> 01:11:12,550
are real inspiration and I think real 
inspiration has a,

1468
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:13,673
is the spectrum of that is very wide.
Whether it's just a folk song or it's 

1469
01:11:17,341 --> 01:11:18,174
like you're at a club and it's got that 
whole rhythm of electronic music and 

1470
01:11:22,651 --> 01:11:23,484
you're just with a group of people and 
you're having this like tribal 

1471
01:11:25,081 --> 01:11:26,910
collective thing.
Cool.

1472
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:28,553
I Think.
I think that that's why I feel like you 

1473
01:11:30,901 --> 01:11:32,610
asked what people need.
I don't know.

1474
01:11:32,611 --> 01:11:33,990
Everyone needs something different and 
no,

1475
01:11:33,991 --> 01:11:34,770
you totally,
you know,

1476
01:11:34,770 --> 01:11:37,320
and whatever that is,
I think it just needs to inspire them.

1477
01:11:38,380 --> 01:11:39,213
We just need to know as a group 
recognize that we're all so fucking 

1478
01:11:43,081 --> 01:11:43,914
different and we've got to stop trying 
to fit everybody into these little 

1479
01:11:46,261 --> 01:11:47,490
package.
Well,

1480
01:11:47,491 --> 01:11:50,370
that's like the pronouns of um.
Oh god,

1481
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:52,590
uh,
Your friend from Canada.

1482
01:11:52,650 --> 01:11:54,900
He was just on the podcast.
Jordan peterson.

1483
01:11:55,890 --> 01:11:58,530
Very interesting stuff.
Very interesting.

1484
01:11:58,660 --> 01:11:59,391
Fascinating.
God.

1485
01:11:59,391 --> 01:11:59,890
Yes.

1486
01:11:59,890 --> 01:12:00,723
You know,
he's dealing with a lot of like really 

1487
01:12:01,741 --> 01:12:05,520
weird political correct weirdness guys.
A very thoughtful guy,

1488
01:12:05,521 --> 01:12:06,354
very well spoken guy,
but people want you to follow their 

1489
01:12:09,630 --> 01:12:10,463
guidelines for how you should think and 
communicate and what you sort of accept 

1490
01:12:13,861 --> 01:12:14,694
and what you should argue against or not
argue against and it becomes this weird 

1491
01:12:19,860 --> 01:12:20,693
sort of control game that goes on and 
that's what's happening with a lot of 

1492
01:12:24,361 --> 01:12:27,300
people in this,
in this nation is fine nation right now.

1493
01:12:27,301 --> 01:12:29,460
People are realizing that they have 
control over people,

1494
01:12:29,670 --> 01:12:30,503
so they're exerting that control almost 
the same way as a person in power does 

1495
01:12:34,330 --> 01:12:35,163
like.
Like one of the things that abraham 

1496
01:12:36,481 --> 01:12:37,560
lincoln said,
it was really brilliant.

1497
01:12:37,740 --> 01:12:40,410
He said,
most men can overcome adversity.

1498
01:12:40,411 --> 01:12:41,400
I'm paraphrasing.
He said,

1499
01:12:41,420 --> 01:12:44,500
most men can overcome adversity.
If you really want to test.

1500
01:12:44,501 --> 01:12:45,690
To me,
I'd give them success.

1501
01:12:46,710 --> 01:12:51,710
Which I thought was really fascinating 
for a lot of people like that are in big

1502
01:12:52,951 --> 01:12:53,784
positions of power,
like the president United States for 

1503
01:12:55,230 --> 01:12:56,910
perfect example.
Like the.

1504
01:12:56,920 --> 01:13:01,830
The idea of him getting through that and
not falling apart his way.

1505
01:13:01,860 --> 01:13:04,620
Like you realize like what a bad 
motherfuCker obama was.

1506
01:13:04,650 --> 01:13:05,850
Holy shit.
Look,

1507
01:13:06,210 --> 01:13:11,210
people have zero idea how good obama's 
composure was to get through that entire

1508
01:13:12,810 --> 01:13:17,810
eight years in the white house without 
one like really gross misstep socially.

1509
01:13:19,110 --> 01:13:22,300
RigHt.
He didn't have one that's,

1510
01:13:22,380 --> 01:13:23,213
that's.
I think there's a lot of people that 

1511
01:13:23,971 --> 01:13:26,790
would probably disagree with that and I 
wouldn't agree with them,

1512
01:13:27,450 --> 01:13:28,283
but that's,
I think that kind of ideological thing 

1513
01:13:30,001 --> 01:13:30,834
though.
They do think that there was one thing 

1514
01:13:32,491 --> 01:13:34,140
that he said he was joking around that 
white horse,

1515
01:13:34,260 --> 01:13:39,260
white house press correspondents' dinner
about the jonas brothers and about a has

1516
01:13:39,421 --> 01:13:41,490
two words for them.
Uh,

1517
01:13:41,491 --> 01:13:43,920
I don't remember that it was something 
about drones.

1518
01:13:44,310 --> 01:13:48,290
What's the word?
What was the big name for the drone?

1519
01:13:49,150 --> 01:13:51,240
There's like a name or another name for 
that drone.

1520
01:13:51,730 --> 01:13:53,970
It was like a type of drone,
isn't there?

1521
01:13:54,850 --> 01:13:56,850
Didn't he say that to them?
To the jonas bRothers?

1522
01:13:59,220 --> 01:14:00,300
Yeah.
He's kinda like a name.

1523
01:14:00,301 --> 01:14:01,134
There's a name for one of the drones.
It's one of the things that he said and 

1524
01:14:02,971 --> 01:14:03,804
it was like,
come on man,

1525
01:14:03,990 --> 01:14:04,823
you've killed like 84 percent civilians 
with drones or the United States has 

1526
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:11,070
like to say to joke around

1527
01:14:12,970 --> 01:14:15,310
with someone who wants to date your 
daughter.

1528
01:14:15,311 --> 01:14:19,140
Come on man.
Like what was the predator?

1529
01:14:19,590 --> 01:14:24,590
Predator after them if they are huge 
fans,

1530
01:14:25,910 --> 01:14:30,910
2010 Boys don't get any ideas.
I have two words for you.

1531
01:14:31,690 --> 01:14:32,523
Predator drones.
You'll never see a comment that he's 

1532
01:14:38,021 --> 01:14:38,854
joking around about killing people.
Do you know many people lost their 

1533
01:14:40,901 --> 01:14:44,110
children to predator drones while he was
an office?

1534
01:14:44,410 --> 01:14:47,380
A lot.
A lot of those things.

1535
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:50,860
They take a look.
The people that are trying to kill those

1536
01:14:51,460 --> 01:14:52,293
terrorists out there and the isis 
members and all the different people 

1537
01:14:54,881 --> 01:14:55,714
that are doing horrible things like 
blowing up ariana grande concerts and 

1538
01:14:59,531 --> 01:15:00,364
all that kind of shit.
I mean the people that are trying to 

1539
01:15:02,231 --> 01:15:04,870
stop those people have an insanely 
difficult job.

1540
01:15:04,930 --> 01:15:09,650
Don't get me wrong,
but when you're shooting missiles out of

1541
01:15:09,651 --> 01:15:13,000
robots,
you're killing mostly innocent people.

1542
01:15:13,270 --> 01:15:14,103
It's not like clothes.
It's not like half and half like they 

1543
01:15:16,871 --> 01:15:19,030
kill half bad guys.
Good guys.

1544
01:15:19,060 --> 01:15:21,850
no,
they killed mostly good people.

1545
01:15:22,040 --> 01:15:23,070
Put it in then.
Oh,

1546
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:23,980
sorry.
That's okay.

1547
01:15:24,190 --> 01:15:25,023
It,
it speaks more to the position of the 

1548
01:15:25,961 --> 01:15:29,520
president is being a tough fucking 
because you can't.

1549
01:15:29,590 --> 01:15:30,423
You can't be a comedian and a comedian 
can say whatever the fuck and it's fine 

1550
01:15:34,391 --> 01:15:36,550
because you're a comedian or whatever.
That would have better delivery.

1551
01:15:37,630 --> 01:15:42,630
I'm imagining coming a mile away to 
adwords for you.

1552
01:15:43,721 --> 01:15:44,680
Oh,
they're going to be funny words.

1553
01:15:47,210 --> 01:15:50,230
He's just joking around about something 
that's a.

1554
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:51,470
It's dark,
you know?

1555
01:15:51,490 --> 01:15:55,480
It's like you'll never see it coming 
like a lot of those people that died.

1556
01:15:55,510 --> 01:15:57,890
Thousands.
That's kind of fucked up.

1557
01:15:57,970 --> 01:15:58,803
If you were living in a country where 
obama was the guy who made the call and 

1558
01:16:04,691 --> 01:16:05,524
the missiles came from the drones and 
killed your dad and you have to watch 

1559
01:16:08,141 --> 01:16:08,974
him joke around about shooting missiles 
at some kids that want to fuck your 

1560
01:16:12,281 --> 01:16:14,490
pretty good daughters.
Whoa.

1561
01:16:14,740 --> 01:16:15,573
You know,
that's a.

1562
01:16:16,690 --> 01:16:18,460
We don't look at it that way because 
we're over here,

1563
01:16:18,490 --> 01:16:19,323
but how can we like,
how can you process that level of a 

1564
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:26,800
variety?
That's a shitty word for it,

1565
01:16:26,801 --> 01:16:27,634
but like there's so much shit going on.
This is why all this social media is 

1566
01:16:30,761 --> 01:16:33,730
happening because along with being a 
distraction and a problem,

1567
01:16:33,731 --> 01:16:36,970
it's also helping us cope with the 
degree of the world.

1568
01:16:36,971 --> 01:16:39,130
you know what I mean?
There's so many fucking people.

1569
01:16:39,430 --> 01:16:44,430
How,
how could you ever be sensitive to the,

1570
01:16:44,770 --> 01:16:48,580
to the entire situation while being an 
authentic person.

1571
01:16:48,610 --> 01:16:49,870
Does that make sense?
Yeah,

1572
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:53,560
but I think this is what we were talking
about earlier of like trying to.

1573
01:16:54,540 --> 01:16:59,050
I mean that's the fucking smallest level
of like learn how to apologize,

1574
01:16:59,350 --> 01:17:00,183
but learn,
learn how to be different from each 

1575
01:17:01,961 --> 01:17:02,794
other and also work together and know 
that like we have different speeds and 

1576
01:17:06,461 --> 01:17:09,800
different beliefs and have compassion

1577
01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:11,293
and I think that's where it's really 
crazy to have so much exposure to the 

1578
01:17:16,341 --> 01:17:17,174
global events and become desensitized to
them because there's so much stuff that 

1579
01:17:21,411 --> 01:17:23,180
it eventually,
like you can't compute.

1580
01:17:23,210 --> 01:17:25,880
You can't process it,
but it doesn't.

1581
01:17:25,881 --> 01:17:26,780
I mean,
obviously there's,

1582
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:27,673
there's no excuse for making jokes about
drones and killing people had to make 

1583
01:17:31,521 --> 01:17:34,160
some jokes and some forum,
but no,

1584
01:17:34,161 --> 01:17:36,260
you're totally right.
There's too much Information.

1585
01:17:36,410 --> 01:17:40,620
You're getting news from $7 million,
putting it on one man when he.

1586
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:41,833
He is not just one man,
but he is a group of people working 

1587
01:17:46,491 --> 01:17:49,970
together,
but he has to speak for everyone and and

1588
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,490
so does trump and so does whoever is 
president and,

1589
01:17:52,610 --> 01:17:53,443
and that's really interesting is that I 
think what has happened now with the 

1590
01:17:57,201 --> 01:18:00,890
election of trump is that people are 
becoming so much more aware that there's

1591
01:18:01,130 --> 01:18:04,910
an entire cabinet and congress and the 
people that we elect,

1592
01:18:04,911 --> 01:18:09,911
that we choose are going to be part of 
that entire team and it's,

1593
01:18:11,071 --> 01:18:12,900
it's really,
it's,

1594
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:15,890
it's focusing people on politics in a 
way it never has before.

1595
01:18:16,780 --> 01:18:17,613
Yeah,
it is.

1596
01:18:17,780 --> 01:18:20,690
Corruption in a weird way.
Like a real transparent.

1597
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:23,420
Speaking of corruption,
and I talked to you about this guy.

1598
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:28,720
I'm about a represent us and it's this 
organization that I went to this meeting

1599
01:18:30,140 --> 01:18:33,530
and was really informed for the first 
time.

1600
01:18:33,531 --> 01:18:38,531
I'd never really understood how people 
in congress kind of came to be these,

1601
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:40,620
um,
you know,

1602
01:18:41,090 --> 01:18:45,440
runners in these elections,
whereas it costs 40 to $60,000

1603
01:18:45,441 --> 01:18:49,010
a day to run for congress and that is 
legal.

1604
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:51,260
That's not illegal.
That's so crazy.

1605
01:18:51,470 --> 01:18:53,060
And uh,
josh silver,

1606
01:18:53,061 --> 01:18:53,894
I,
until I talk to you about him a little 

1607
01:18:54,501 --> 01:18:55,130
bit,
uh,

1608
01:18:55,130 --> 01:18:55,963
started this organization and they're,
they're working on a long day anti 

1609
01:18:58,371 --> 01:19:02,090
corruption bills so that anybody can run
some,

1610
01:19:02,150 --> 01:19:02,983
you know,
uh,

1611
01:19:03,020 --> 01:19:07,130
an incredibly over accomplished,
you know,

1612
01:19:07,460 --> 01:19:08,293
qual,
overqualified person from say columbia 

1613
01:19:11,121 --> 01:19:16,121
or harvard or wherever in the world or 
in the states who we elected.

1614
01:19:16,340 --> 01:19:20,780
Whereas these people that cost that much
money to run their,

1615
01:19:20,781 --> 01:19:24,230
they're controlled by the koch brothers 
and all the major oil industries.

1616
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:26,810
What are they spending the money on it 
because that much a day.

1617
01:19:27,380 --> 01:19:28,213
That's just the game.
That's just transportation of 

1618
01:19:30,870 --> 01:19:31,703
advertisement,
promotion and you don't qualify if you 

1619
01:19:34,251 --> 01:19:35,930
don't,
if you don't play that game.

1620
01:19:35,960 --> 01:19:37,660
But here's the thing,
you can qualify,

1621
01:19:37,700 --> 01:19:41,570
like if you ran for senate or something,
you would be spending $60 for president.

1622
01:19:41,810 --> 01:19:43,730
You know what I mean?
That's what's interesting,

1623
01:19:43,731 --> 01:19:44,564
right?
I mean I.

1624
01:19:44,620 --> 01:19:48,050
Well it because you have a platform 
already and people have platforms in the

1625
01:19:48,051 --> 01:19:49,460
world.
That's Donald Trump.

1626
01:19:49,730 --> 01:19:50,563
Did you know that when you have a 
platform she run up for like stan hope 

1627
01:19:52,741 --> 01:19:53,574
was running for president for awhile.
We had a friend that ran for president 

1628
01:19:57,770 --> 01:19:58,603
while he was running for president is 
that he couldn't do standup shows 

1629
01:20:01,641 --> 01:20:05,150
anymore because if he was going to do 
something on stage,

1630
01:20:05,151 --> 01:20:06,860
he would have.
If it was like a public

1631
01:20:08,490 --> 01:20:09,323
where people were coming to see him,
he would have to allot time for his 

1632
01:20:11,911 --> 01:20:13,450
opponents.
Right.

1633
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:14,640
And I was like,
what?

1634
01:20:14,700 --> 01:20:15,540
And he's like,
yeah.

1635
01:20:15,541 --> 01:20:16,950
He goes,
it's a crazy scam.

1636
01:20:16,980 --> 01:20:18,800
It's like you can most of the game.
Yeah.

1637
01:20:18,870 --> 01:20:22,350
There's a lot of like weird freaky old 
school rules.

1638
01:20:22,351 --> 01:20:23,184
Back when people would stand on a 
soapbox and scream out into a large 

1639
01:20:26,371 --> 01:20:29,330
group of people.
Those rules still apply crazy.

1640
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:32,010
But the thing is you can do,
you can still,

1641
01:20:32,130 --> 01:20:34,440
if you have 10 million people being 
like,

1642
01:20:34,470 --> 01:20:37,380
that's a stupid rule or however many it 
takes,

1643
01:20:37,650 --> 01:20:39,660
it'll change maybe.
But look,

1644
01:20:39,661 --> 01:20:41,910
it's still federally illegal to smoke 
marijuana.

1645
01:20:41,970 --> 01:20:45,510
there's no reason why we did,
but the state legal,

1646
01:20:45,540 --> 01:20:48,290
but federally it's still illegal.
So it's not as simple as.

1647
01:20:49,340 --> 01:20:52,860
It's not as simple as like 10 million 
people can say.

1648
01:20:52,861 --> 01:20:54,810
They don't want to take more totally 
right.

1649
01:20:54,930 --> 01:20:55,900
Again,
that's the same day.

1650
01:20:56,340 --> 01:20:58,050
what's going to go on with our political
system.

1651
01:20:58,051 --> 01:20:58,591
It's like,
yeah,

1652
01:20:58,591 --> 01:21:00,420
it needs an Overhaul and yeah,
it needs to be changed.

1653
01:21:00,421 --> 01:21:01,254
Needs to be updated for the internet and
the 2017 world that we live in and we 

1654
01:21:04,591 --> 01:21:06,240
need to figure out a better way to do 
it.

1655
01:21:06,241 --> 01:21:08,670
We don't need the same sort of 
representative government that we alwaYs

1656
01:21:08,671 --> 01:21:09,504
needed.
When you had to take a message from a 

1657
01:21:11,161 --> 01:21:13,710
fucking horse travel,

1658
01:21:13,770 --> 01:21:15,360
the pricing is.
It's like if,

1659
01:21:15,380 --> 01:21:16,213
if you wAnna,
if you want that to change from the 

1660
01:21:18,181 --> 01:21:19,014
ground up,
you're asking the people that are 

1661
01:21:20,881 --> 01:21:24,210
currently in office to bet against 
themselves to say,

1662
01:21:24,211 --> 01:21:26,050
hey,
let's make it illegal

1663
01:21:26,230 --> 01:21:28,400
behavior citizens is what you're asking,
right?

1664
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:30,193
Stop thinking that they're better or 
different than us and that's where it 

1665
01:21:32,831 --> 01:21:34,150
becomes unfathomable.
Well,

1666
01:21:34,151 --> 01:21:37,390
they have.
They have to just like everybody else,

1667
01:21:37,870 --> 01:21:41,290
we all have to realize that we're all 
the same thing and every,

1668
01:21:41,291 --> 01:21:42,124
there's,
there's no kings anymore and there 

1669
01:21:43,271 --> 01:21:44,104
should be.
I mean edward snowden tweeted this the 

1670
01:21:44,981 --> 01:21:45,814
other day that people couldn't at one 
point in time couldn't imagine the idea 

1671
01:21:48,911 --> 01:21:51,550
that one day there'd be no kings and 
they're going to say that.

1672
01:21:51,551 --> 01:21:54,340
The same thing about presidents one day 
and it's for sure going to happen.

1673
01:21:54,610 --> 01:21:57,370
The president or whoever runs for 
congress or senate,

1674
01:21:57,610 --> 01:21:58,443
they have to come to an understanding 
that they are no different than us just 

1675
01:22:02,020 --> 01:22:04,570
because they're in positions of power.
They're not different.

1676
01:22:05,340 --> 01:22:06,173
We're all just people and that if you 
have extra power over people and you 

1677
01:22:10,001 --> 01:22:12,370
utilize it,
you should be ashamed of yourself.

1678
01:22:12,370 --> 01:22:13,650
You should feel horrible.
Like,

1679
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:15,130
did you guys hear what chris christie 
did?

1680
01:22:15,160 --> 01:22:17,980
The beach thing.
He closed down the beaches in New Jersey

1681
01:22:17,981 --> 01:22:20,620
and then vacation on the beaches with 
his family.

1682
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:23,300
they closed them down due to budget cuts
in the shirt on.

1683
01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:27,650
He had his shirt off,
but he got caught.

1684
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:29,740
He got caught lying.
They asked him,

1685
01:22:29,741 --> 01:22:30,850
did you get any sun?
He said,

1686
01:22:30,851 --> 01:22:32,170
no,
I didn't get any sun in.

1687
01:22:32,171 --> 01:22:34,650
The pictures came out and he's like,
ha.

1688
01:22:34,780 --> 01:22:35,613
They said,
oh,

1689
01:22:35,620 --> 01:22:38,150
mr christie had a baseball hat on.
So he didn't get his son.

1690
01:22:38,350 --> 01:22:38,921
Like,
no,

1691
01:22:38,921 --> 01:22:40,600
that's not a loophole.
You were lying.

1692
01:22:40,601 --> 01:22:42,430
You're still in the sun.
You're not in a house.

1693
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:44,420
If you're not in a house,
you're getting sun you.

1694
01:22:44,710 --> 01:22:45,543
This is a play on words.
Bullshit that's happening in the media 

1695
01:22:48,011 --> 01:22:50,430
where it's like people are,
you know,

1696
01:22:50,650 --> 01:22:55,030
you don't.
They just circumvent around the truth or

1697
01:22:55,031 --> 01:22:59,620
whatever they're trying to say with just
just stupid rhetoric is so annoying.

1698
01:22:59,870 --> 01:23:01,390
I fucking hate it.
It's changing.

1699
01:23:01,650 --> 01:23:02,770
It's.
I don't know.

1700
01:23:03,390 --> 01:23:05,890
It's changing because if this was years 
ago

1701
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:06,813
that news wouldn't have gotten out or 
there would have been ways to just like 

1702
01:23:09,340 --> 01:23:11,530
crush that and there still are so true 
though.

1703
01:23:11,531 --> 01:23:13,140
You're right,
but it's definitely changing.

1704
01:23:13,180 --> 01:23:14,013
Yeah.
There's a kind of a to many of you wish 

1705
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:18,120
to hide that stuff,
not just that.

1706
01:23:18,130 --> 01:23:19,840
I mean,
look what you're doing right now.

1707
01:23:19,841 --> 01:23:21,670
You're talking to millions of people I 
guess,

1708
01:23:21,830 --> 01:23:22,663
and you signed that does help with that,
so you're saying it to millions of 

1709
01:23:25,721 --> 01:23:26,554
people and then millions of people are 
going to have similar conversations 

1710
01:23:28,571 --> 01:23:30,880
because of that.
When you hear something interesting that

1711
01:23:30,881 --> 01:23:32,790
someone talks about,
you start talking about hair.

1712
01:23:32,810 --> 01:23:33,643
This interesting conversation really 
made me think about something and then 

1713
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:39,670
that just wasn't even available 10 years
ago.

1714
01:23:39,910 --> 01:23:44,080
It wasn't available 20 years ago.
Like all the social media stuff,

1715
01:23:44,110 --> 01:23:44,943
all the,
whether it's youtube videos that people 

1716
01:23:47,381 --> 01:23:51,290
can make or podcast that people can make
or whatever the fuck it is.

1717
01:23:51,340 --> 01:23:52,173
Blogs that people can write.
All of it is just information and that 

1718
01:23:56,741 --> 01:23:58,960
flow of information has never been 
greater.

1719
01:23:58,961 --> 01:24:01,030
It is an unstoppable river.
Now,

1720
01:24:01,370 --> 01:24:03,520
you know,
to the point where that's why that baked

1721
01:24:03,521 --> 01:24:06,580
Alaska dude was laughing like the 
fucking president jumped into the river,

1722
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:07,753
like he's in the crazy river putting up 
memes and talking shit about people 

1723
01:24:12,310 --> 01:24:15,220
joking around about some lady having a 
fucking plastic surgery.

1724
01:24:15,221 --> 01:24:18,600
She had like a face lift.
And you said she was bleeding like,

1725
01:24:18,610 --> 01:24:21,670
do you believe that you believe that the
president is saying this,

1726
01:24:22,930 --> 01:24:24,350
move that movie?
Um,

1727
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:30,000
uh,
luke wilson and idiocrasy idiocracy.

1728
01:24:30,680 --> 01:24:33,370
It's happening.
It is really happening.

1729
01:24:33,870 --> 01:24:34,703
Well,
it's for sure a bad system that no one 

1730
01:24:36,001 --> 01:24:37,770
wants to join in.
Like if you're elon musk,

1731
01:24:37,771 --> 01:24:39,210
why the fuck would you want to be 
president?

1732
01:24:39,350 --> 01:24:41,540
I can bang supermodels and build rocket 
ships.

1733
01:24:41,550 --> 01:24:42,530
Boom.
Why do I want to know?

1734
01:24:42,530 --> 01:24:42,540
Do you know

1735
01:24:42,540 --> 01:24:43,373
about our car?
Do you know the funny story about our 

1736
01:24:45,301 --> 01:24:46,860
touring vehicle?
I do not.

1737
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:47,490
Oh,
it's great.

1738
01:24:47,490 --> 01:24:48,360
Drop it.
So,

1739
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:49,350
uh,
oh my god.

1740
01:24:49,351 --> 01:24:50,430
Ben,
is it three years ago?

1741
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:52,260
Yeah.
Twenty 15,

1742
01:24:52,290 --> 01:24:56,400
2015.
So in spring of 2015 we thought it would

1743
01:24:56,401 --> 01:24:57,234
be.
This is when we put punk kid up for a 

1744
01:24:59,611 --> 01:25:00,444
donation so we could buy a car.
So we could tour and we didn't want to 

1745
01:25:02,701 --> 01:25:05,520
buy a van because that's annoying.
Who wants a van?

1746
01:25:05,910 --> 01:25:06,743
And we ended up,
we were looking at [inaudible] and we 

1747
01:25:08,970 --> 01:25:13,150
found a cadillac escalades.
Two thousand seven seas decided,

1748
01:25:14,300 --> 01:25:18,090
well they're all the same car ps four it
expeditions,

1749
01:25:18,091 --> 01:25:20,700
escalades navigators to whatever the 
year.

1750
01:25:20,701 --> 01:25:22,500
They're the same,
same structure,

1751
01:25:22,501 --> 01:25:23,334
just different clothes and there was a 
great deal on a cadillac escalades and 

1752
01:25:28,530 --> 01:25:29,363
we had like good a lot of touring in 
front of us and we bought it and we 

1753
01:25:34,651 --> 01:25:36,390
were,
we bought it with 60,000

1754
01:25:36,391 --> 01:25:38,100
miles on it and it was in mint 
condition,

1755
01:25:38,101 --> 01:25:39,300
which was really strange.

1756
01:25:39,480 --> 01:25:43,510
And like the used car salesman logan,
there's clearly no kids in the backseat.

1757
01:25:43,620 --> 01:25:45,130
There's no cheerios took between the 
seats.

1758
01:25:46,170 --> 01:25:47,003
And so we ended up buying this car and 
we were looking through the user manual 

1759
01:25:52,410 --> 01:25:55,710
to like what does this button do in the 
former owner registration fell out.

1760
01:25:55,711 --> 01:26:00,711
Swear to got elon musk and ben had this 
great idea,

1761
01:26:01,830 --> 01:26:06,830
great idea to get him to design a tesco 
laid for better economical touring.

1762
01:26:08,900 --> 01:26:11,060
But to put it into perspective though,
we did,

1763
01:26:11,061 --> 01:26:12,680
we bought it with 60,000
miles an hour.

1764
01:26:12,681 --> 01:26:13,514
It has like a 160,000
miles on it and that was just about a 

1765
01:26:16,701 --> 01:26:17,780
little over two years ago.

1766
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:18,713
Have you seen that shit?
He's going to do in California where he 

1767
01:26:20,070 --> 01:26:23,100
bores holes under los angeles and makes 
tunnels.

1768
01:26:23,101 --> 01:26:25,740
And you ride a sled through the tunnel?
I heard about it,

1769
01:26:25,970 --> 01:26:26,803
but I heard about briefly actually you.
You dropped down into this tunnel and 

1770
01:26:30,371 --> 01:26:32,370
you go shoot you.
You don't drive your car.

1771
01:26:32,910 --> 01:26:34,730
Why?
John?

1772
01:26:34,731 --> 01:26:35,431
Jamie,
I'll pull it up.

1773
01:26:35,431 --> 01:26:37,650
You could see it.
So watch what happens timmy.

1774
01:26:38,030 --> 01:26:40,530
You pull up to this thing,
he's a wizard.

1775
01:26:40,770 --> 01:26:44,460
You pull up to this thing and it drops 
you down to your car.

1776
01:26:44,490 --> 01:26:45,780
Yeah,
it drops you down.

1777
01:26:45,870 --> 01:26:48,630
You get your blood,
get in the queue and you dropped down.

1778
01:26:48,631 --> 01:26:51,810
And then you get on a sled your cars on 
a sled so you're not driving anymore.

1779
01:26:52,150 --> 01:26:54,330
And your car can be on a Solar powered 
sled too,

1780
01:26:54,331 --> 01:26:56,760
by the way.
But all the power we have in la from the

1781
01:26:56,761 --> 01:26:57,594
sun,
I mean it never stops being sunny out 

1782
01:26:59,340 --> 01:26:59,490
of.

1783
01:26:59,490 --> 01:27:02,160
They wanted to make these giant solar 
banks to power this thing.

1784
01:27:02,161 --> 01:27:03,740
I bet they could,
but there's a video of it,

1785
01:27:03,780 --> 01:27:05,910
like the idea of it,
the animated version of it.

1786
01:27:06,300 --> 01:27:08,760
So of course everyone in the street,
he's driving a tesla.

1787
01:27:08,761 --> 01:27:09,594
There's nothing but tesla's and an old 
rotten shitty cars from the 60 pay more 

1788
01:27:14,940 --> 01:27:16,850
to get on the sled to.
Yeah.

1789
01:27:17,110 --> 01:27:20,040
Otherwise you're one of those traffic.
So watch this,

1790
01:27:20,041 --> 01:27:22,590
you dropped down and then once you 
dropped down,

1791
01:27:23,070 --> 01:27:23,903
you are in these tunnels that he's 
building that are totally earthquake 

1792
01:27:26,251 --> 01:27:28,260
proof.
Don't worry when they fill up with water

1793
01:27:28,261 --> 01:27:30,630
and kill you and your family,
don't sweat it.

1794
01:27:32,650 --> 01:27:37,650
Look after you.
Make sure you have your go bag ready.

1795
01:27:38,761 --> 01:27:43,761
Fan of is your oxygen mask on freeways.
I just need everybody to understand that

1796
01:27:44,791 --> 01:27:45,624
when the 1000 foot waves come,
you will not survive in these fucking 

1797
01:27:48,451 --> 01:27:49,284
tubes.
They will fill up with water and you 

1798
01:27:51,541 --> 01:27:52,790
will drown.
Joe,

1799
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:56,610
I'm so scared of most likely that 
tsunamis not common,

1800
01:27:56,640 --> 01:27:58,570
but if anyone.
This is insane.

1801
01:27:58,650 --> 01:27:59,540
That's a wrap.
No,

1802
01:27:59,570 --> 01:28:01,230
a lot of thumbs downs though.
Yeah,

1803
01:28:01,231 --> 01:28:02,850
because people are freaking out about 
the ocean.

1804
01:28:02,890 --> 01:28:03,723
Well,
rIght next to the fucking ocean in the 

1805
01:28:04,951 --> 01:28:09,951
ground moves.
So we shouldn't be flying cars,

1806
01:28:15,090 --> 01:28:18,210
flying cars that have batteries in the 
front so they can hit each other.

1807
01:28:18,211 --> 01:28:19,170
So they're like,
repel,

1808
01:28:21,270 --> 01:28:22,530
repel.
You don't want to bump,

1809
01:28:22,531 --> 01:28:26,570
dude.
You want to repel like two magnets that.

1810
01:28:28,140 --> 01:28:28,973
Hold on.
I'm writing the device last night that 

1811
01:28:30,361 --> 01:28:32,460
scared the bejesus out of me

1812
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:34,130
was it?
It was,

1813
01:28:34,220 --> 01:28:37,190
um,
they were showing just,

1814
01:28:37,750 --> 01:28:38,583
you know,
technological intelligence to overtake 

1815
01:28:41,271 --> 01:28:43,760
cars and control the computers in the 
cars and just,

1816
01:28:44,300 --> 01:28:46,290
it was crazy.
It was just like a,

1817
01:28:46,490 --> 01:28:49,580
just hacking hacking into any kind of 
car.

1818
01:28:49,850 --> 01:28:53,330
And I'm gonna I'm gonna,
shut you down and run you off this cliff

1819
01:28:53,331 --> 01:28:56,260
or I'm gonna fuck with you and make your
windows go up and down.

1820
01:28:56,261 --> 01:28:58,490
And It's crazy.
I mean,

1821
01:28:58,491 --> 01:29:01,070
I don't want to be scared.
I don't want to live with like,

1822
01:29:01,110 --> 01:29:02,070
oh god.
And I

1823
01:29:02,370 --> 01:29:04,350
try not to,
but that's fucking crazy.

1824
01:29:05,250 --> 01:29:06,420
Fucking crazy.
You know,

1825
01:29:06,421 --> 01:29:07,254
that journalists,
they think the big conspiracy theory is 

1826
01:29:09,180 --> 01:29:09,660
that,
uh,

1827
01:29:09,660 --> 01:29:13,710
he was killed because they overtook the 
controls of his car and slammed him into

1828
01:29:13,711 --> 01:29:15,600
a tree and made him go 120 miles an 
hour.

1829
01:29:15,810 --> 01:29:17,100
He was his name,
michael.

1830
01:29:17,101 --> 01:29:18,640
Um,
he was a fan.

1831
01:29:18,750 --> 01:29:19,583
it was a famous journalist who wrote a 
story in the rolling stones about a 

1832
01:29:21,301 --> 01:29:25,230
general and it was,
he was embedded with them,

1833
01:29:25,290 --> 01:29:27,690
I believe it was in Iraq,
in Afghanistan.

1834
01:29:27,720 --> 01:29:30,690
And he was the dumb.
No,

1835
01:29:30,691 --> 01:29:31,790
no,
it wasn't about portrays.

1836
01:29:31,950 --> 01:29:34,090
It was another general,
but no,

1837
01:29:34,340 --> 01:29:34,860
no,
it,

1838
01:29:34,860 --> 01:29:37,760
there's a different general michael 
hastings.

1839
01:29:38,580 --> 01:29:39,413
So he wrote this article about this 
general in the general how to step down 

1840
01:29:42,240 --> 01:29:47,240
because the general was joking around 
about obama or somethIng like that.

1841
01:29:48,361 --> 01:29:50,880
And there was just some.
He got a little loose.

1842
01:29:51,480 --> 01:29:52,313
What does this close sitting foot.
So this apparently they tried to say 

1843
01:29:57,961 --> 01:30:02,220
that he committed suicide and some 
people believe he did commit suicide and

1844
01:30:02,221 --> 01:30:03,054
some people believe so she's just flying
down and just slammed into a tree and 

1845
01:30:06,061 --> 01:30:09,330
his fucking car blows up.
I'm,

1846
01:30:09,510 --> 01:30:12,960
here's the thing though,
and this is like in the interest of full

1847
01:30:12,961 --> 01:30:14,070
disclosure,
they,

1848
01:30:14,250 --> 01:30:19,110
they apparently said that they found 
amphetamines on him,

1849
01:30:19,560 --> 01:30:20,700
on his body,
right?

1850
01:30:20,970 --> 01:30:24,810
So that could mean that he was under the
influence of amphetamines.

1851
01:30:24,811 --> 01:30:25,644
What had happened,
or it could mean that he takes adderall 

1852
01:30:28,441 --> 01:30:30,660
because a lot of journalists take 
adderall,

1853
01:30:30,661 --> 01:30:33,720
so they found in his system,
it doesn't necessarily mean he was speed

1854
01:30:33,721 --> 01:30:36,420
it up when he was driving like a fucking
maniac because he was off the rails.

1855
01:30:36,660 --> 01:30:40,470
It could just easily have meant that he 
uses adderall to get his workload done,

1856
01:30:40,471 --> 01:30:42,870
which a shitload of journalists do.

1857
01:30:42,990 --> 01:30:43,823
So it might not have been anything.
And we talked to people that are 

1858
01:30:45,391 --> 01:30:46,500
experts.
Boy,

1859
01:30:46,510 --> 01:30:50,430
people that are experts that weigh in on
conspiracy car crash evidence.

1860
01:30:50,431 --> 01:30:51,264
They're weirdos.
It's hard to find like who's right and 

1861
01:30:53,431 --> 01:30:54,264
who's wrong,
but some people said that the way the 

1862
01:30:57,030 --> 01:30:57,863
car had a separate,
the way the engine had exploded and 

1863
01:31:01,020 --> 01:31:04,590
launched itself from the car indicate 
some sort of an explosion more.

1864
01:31:04,591 --> 01:31:07,470
It doesn't impact,
you know,

1865
01:31:07,680 --> 01:31:10,980
because it just all hit the hit the tree
and blew up all at once,

1866
01:31:11,160 --> 01:31:12,750
but again,
could be bullshit,

1867
01:31:12,990 --> 01:31:15,810
but it is fucked up because the guy 
wrote a very,

1868
01:31:16,020 --> 01:31:16,853
he wrote a very scathing article about 
this general and I made the general 

1869
01:31:19,711 --> 01:31:20,544
retire and I know that guy got a shit 
ton of death threats and he was telling 

1870
01:31:23,221 --> 01:31:24,054
everybody that if somebody kills me,
like be be sure that I didn't kill 

1871
01:31:27,901 --> 01:31:28,734
myself.

1872
01:31:30,330 --> 01:31:31,500
Fuck,
that's crazy.

1873
01:31:31,620 --> 01:31:33,540
They can take over your car because your
car is a computer.

1874
01:31:33,810 --> 01:31:36,720
Your car.
A lot of cars today are connected to the

1875
01:31:36,721 --> 01:31:38,820
internet through wifi.
A lot of cars,

1876
01:31:39,240 --> 01:31:41,400
like they,
they have their own wifi hub.

1877
01:31:41,670 --> 01:31:44,990
Like you buy a new escalate,
it comes with a wifi hubs.

1878
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:45,833
All the people in the car can play on 
their ipads or whatever while you drive 

1879
01:31:48,591 --> 01:31:51,660
and you link up to the internet.
That's on the um,

1880
01:31:52,110 --> 01:31:54,660
on the actual car itself,
that's a computer.

1881
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:56,760
It's a computer.
It's connected to the net,

1882
01:31:57,170 --> 01:31:59,060
driving around,
you know,

1883
01:31:59,350 --> 01:32:00,070
somebody just gets

1884
01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:03,620
in there.
I mean there's,

1885
01:32:04,330 --> 01:32:06,610
there's no,
there's no bounds at this point.

1886
01:32:09,220 --> 01:32:14,220
How can you keep things organized?
Probably isn't the right way,

1887
01:32:14,590 --> 01:32:19,590
but how do you keep us all alive without
surrendering personal freedom?

1888
01:32:20,021 --> 01:32:20,771
LIke boom,
boom,

1889
01:32:20,771 --> 01:32:21,190
boom.
Like what?

1890
01:32:21,190 --> 01:32:23,830
Can we kind of have a crazy what's going
on with your question?

1891
01:32:24,440 --> 01:32:27,960
Just stop working on to see what the 
deal was.

1892
01:32:28,050 --> 01:32:30,190
We don't have to talk about what you,

1893
01:32:30,410 --> 01:32:31,250
you know,
you don't,

1894
01:32:32,210 --> 01:32:34,850
you don't really have an answer to that 
question because we don't even know what

1895
01:32:34,851 --> 01:32:36,230
they could really do right now.

1896
01:32:36,650 --> 01:32:37,483
One,
especially if part of the important 

1897
01:32:38,841 --> 01:32:41,480
thing we need to accept is that we're 
all the same thing,

1898
01:32:41,900 --> 01:32:42,733
then we have to accept that we all have 
to start acting like the same thing at 

1899
01:32:45,501 --> 01:32:46,700
the same time.
Right?

1900
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:49,490
That's a,
that's a very good point.

1901
01:32:49,491 --> 01:32:50,324
but it gets lost when you start talking 
about people that are in the military 

1902
01:32:53,430 --> 01:32:54,263
and that are dealing with a national 
emergencies or national security 

1903
01:32:59,421 --> 01:33:00,254
situations.
But when you make a general retire 

1904
01:33:03,560 --> 01:33:08,560
because you um,
you chose to write an article about some

1905
01:33:08,811 --> 01:33:09,644
things that you heard him say that it 
gets him fired and then somehow or 

1906
01:33:11,961 --> 01:33:14,960
another the military becomes compromised
because it's very important.

1907
01:33:14,961 --> 01:33:16,940
Leader is no longer in a position of 
power.

1908
01:33:17,450 --> 01:33:20,940
That's a very tricky situation.
It's very tricky.

1909
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,330
You did,
you dId get the scoop and you did get to

1910
01:33:23,331 --> 01:33:25,580
say how this guy was communicating,
you know,

1911
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:26,593
candidly,

1912
01:33:27,690 --> 01:33:29,370
but things,
things are happening,

1913
01:33:29,940 --> 01:33:33,780
they're happening interdependently and 
also completely and mess.

1914
01:33:33,781 --> 01:33:36,360
Like you can't mess the way that all 
these things,

1915
01:33:36,361 --> 01:33:37,141
technology,
baba,

1916
01:33:37,141 --> 01:33:40,530
buzz is developing.
But there it is.

1917
01:33:40,710 --> 01:33:43,320
There's no way this dude,
they can control that much.

1918
01:33:43,321 --> 01:33:46,830
There's no way people can control where 
this is going.

1919
01:33:46,831 --> 01:33:49,350
And by this I mean everything to that 
degree.

1920
01:33:49,351 --> 01:33:54,351
So you just have to deal with all these 
new phenomenon.

1921
01:33:55,050 --> 01:33:55,883
They're happening.

1922
01:33:55,960 --> 01:33:56,620
Oh yeah,
for sure.

1923
01:33:56,620 --> 01:33:57,610
Look at this.
This is the article,

1924
01:33:57,611 --> 01:33:58,444
the runaway general to profile that 
brought down mcchrystal rolling stone 

1925
01:34:01,991 --> 01:34:05,230
profile of stanley mcchrystal that 
changed history.

1926
01:34:05,590 --> 01:34:06,423
That's crazY.
That one article can get a general fire 

1927
01:34:10,750 --> 01:34:14,080
change history and it's crazy.
The guy who wrote it is dead,

1928
01:34:14,380 --> 01:34:15,213
dead as fuck,
and they think dead from a crazy 

1929
01:34:17,201 --> 01:34:18,940
conspiracy.
Michael hastings,

1930
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:21,490
you know,
who the fuck knows it's,

1931
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:25,790
but boy does it.
What's exciting is that the pit.

1932
01:34:25,910 --> 01:34:26,743
Wow.
So he's playing the general in this 

1933
01:34:30,701 --> 01:34:33,060
movie,
he's playing a run,

1934
01:34:33,080 --> 01:34:33,913
a runaway general.
There's this netflix movie movie based 

1935
01:34:37,031 --> 01:34:39,040
on rolling stone reporter michael 
hastings.

1936
01:34:39,041 --> 01:34:39,874
Wow.
They're doing a movie based on that 

1937
01:34:42,430 --> 01:34:44,680
thing happening for.
That's crazy,

1938
01:34:45,730 --> 01:34:47,080
isn't it?
IT's on netflix now.

1939
01:34:47,140 --> 01:34:48,820
Get the fuck out of here.
That's what it was about.

1940
01:34:48,910 --> 01:34:50,010
It's a netflix boding.
Yeah.

1941
01:34:50,710 --> 01:34:53,950
Dude.
Netflix almost has too much content.

1942
01:34:55,390 --> 01:34:57,190
It's overwhelming.
It's overwhelming.

1943
01:34:57,230 --> 01:34:58,100
and it's funny because

1944
01:34:58,100 --> 01:35:01,430
there's so much content that,
that the quality's not that great.

1945
01:35:01,730 --> 01:35:02,563
So you get some shows in like,
I'll like this weekend I had this like 

1946
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:07,633
25 minutes in now and I just couldn't 
fucking land on anything when were 

1947
01:35:11,570 --> 01:35:15,940
trying to land on something,
something with substance and,

1948
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:19,790
and just more um,
thought.

1949
01:35:20,390 --> 01:35:25,390
And I ended up watching Harry Potter 
fire and I was so happy with my choice.

1950
01:35:25,940 --> 01:35:26,773
Okay.
All right.

1951
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:31,370
Let me tell you something.
I've just started reading Harry Potter.

1952
01:35:35,960 --> 01:35:40,070
Harry potter is amazingly important.
Figures and let's be honest,

1953
01:35:40,130 --> 01:35:40,963
there's a lot of parallels to the 
wizarding world and are fucking weird 

1954
01:35:44,391 --> 01:35:47,420
world in politics.
There's politics in the wizarding world.

1955
01:35:47,421 --> 01:35:48,254
His word.
You guys ever go to the Harry Potter 

1956
01:35:50,541 --> 01:35:52,010
ride at universal?
Not yet.

1957
01:35:52,011 --> 01:35:53,470
I haven't finished.
I want.

1958
01:35:53,480 --> 01:35:57,660
I'm a book and a half from finishing,
so I don't know what happened,

1959
01:35:57,670 --> 01:36:01,820
so fuck It up for me about the ride at 
universal.

1960
01:36:01,930 --> 01:36:03,830
Yeah,
but I don't want to entertain.

1961
01:36:03,860 --> 01:36:04,693
Do you really think I know the plot?
Any of those clubs like you do and 

1962
01:36:06,801 --> 01:36:08,660
you're displaying.
Here we go.

1963
01:36:13,260 --> 01:36:14,093
So then I.
So it's not decided who's just in the 

1964
01:36:16,040 --> 01:36:16,791
back to.
Oh,

1965
01:36:16,791 --> 01:36:18,160
I'll drive here.
Give it to me.

1966
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:20,530
I don't give a shit.
Do you have any proteIn bars?

1967
01:36:22,140 --> 01:36:26,240
Protein bars,
uber worry.

1968
01:36:26,250 --> 01:36:27,083
Not my friends.
We'll get through this with a steady 

1969
01:36:28,851 --> 01:36:31,670
hand.
There is no concern,

1970
01:36:31,671 --> 01:36:34,730
but the Harry Potter ride at universal 
is the shit.

1971
01:36:34,731 --> 01:36:37,490
It's really fun.
It's fucking crazy.

1972
01:36:37,850 --> 01:36:38,890
You've been in.
Oh yeah.

1973
01:36:38,891 --> 01:36:39,724
Yeah.
It's fun.

1974
01:36:40,150 --> 01:36:41,780
It's really fun.
Does it feel.

1975
01:36:41,781 --> 01:36:43,910
I was telling you about this?
Maybe it's the same thing,

1976
01:36:44,060 --> 01:36:46,100
don't you get on a broom and it feels 
like you're flying.

1977
01:36:46,410 --> 01:36:48,980
That's not a broom.
You're sitting in a chair,

1978
01:36:49,640 --> 01:36:51,200
but you're flying around.
Yeah.

1979
01:36:51,201 --> 01:36:53,300
Like you kind of would be if you were in
a broom.

1980
01:36:53,330 --> 01:36:54,590
Yeah,
there's a lot of stuff going on.

1981
01:36:54,591 --> 01:36:56,030
Just dragging and shit.
It's fun.

1982
01:36:56,470 --> 01:36:57,800
Oh my god.
It's really good ride.

1983
01:36:57,830 --> 01:36:58,663
It's like it's really well made.
You didn't understand this level of 

1984
01:37:00,861 --> 01:37:04,100
excitement was the Harry Potter late 
bloomer.

1985
01:37:04,101 --> 01:37:05,600
Okay.
I was all lord of the rings.

1986
01:37:05,601 --> 01:37:06,434
I read dune love dune.
Just like I'm a total nerd and I didn't 

1987
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:12,193
read Harry Potter and ben really 
encouraged me this past year and he got 

1988
01:37:15,351 --> 01:37:20,351
me the sorcerer's stone,
which is the first book and I just can't

1989
01:37:21,570 --> 01:37:22,740
and we don't have to.

1990
01:37:24,850 --> 01:37:26,240
It's amazing.
Like I can't,

1991
01:37:26,690 --> 01:37:30,770
I can't tell you how much joy it brought
me as an adult.

1992
01:37:30,771 --> 01:37:31,970
Yeah,
it's just,

1993
01:37:32,470 --> 01:37:33,800
here's the thing,
I think,

1994
01:37:33,950 --> 01:37:35,580
um,
I,

1995
01:37:35,630 --> 01:37:40,630
I feel like I have an affinity for like 
fighting darkness just in myself because

1996
01:37:40,941 --> 01:37:44,390
I'm fucking dark,
but I'm also very light,

1997
01:37:44,600 --> 01:37:45,321
so,
you know,

1998
01:37:45,321 --> 01:37:48,050
as such is life and it's.
Yeah.

1999
01:37:48,051 --> 01:37:50,660
Here we go,
I'm going in,

2000
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:56,200
but I folks listening at home,
they bought the last book,

2001
01:37:56,670 --> 01:37:59,040
the last book was the order of the 
phoenix,

2002
01:37:59,041 --> 01:38:01,740
which is very political because there's,
there's,

2003
01:38:01,830 --> 01:38:03,660
you know,
a political presence,

2004
01:38:03,661 --> 01:38:05,580
there's the government,
excuse me,

2005
01:38:05,640 --> 01:38:06,473
within the wizarding community and it 
was just really interesting to be 

2006
01:38:08,701 --> 01:38:09,534
reading that while also like watching 
our local news and our global news and 

2007
01:38:12,811 --> 01:38:16,920
just it's,
it's all part of the same story in terms

2008
01:38:16,921 --> 01:38:21,921
of manipulation and what we interpret as
truth and it was,

2009
01:38:24,310 --> 01:38:25,143
it was just an interesting experience to
read that book and then to listen to 

2010
01:38:29,161 --> 01:38:33,780
like my favorite podcasts and news 
outlets and be like,

2011
01:38:33,781 --> 01:38:35,670
this isn't any different than Harry 
Potter.

2012
01:38:38,090 --> 01:38:41,140
The familiarity of problems in human 
nature.

2013
01:38:41,141 --> 01:38:43,830
Right.
It's all based on good and evil and fuck

2014
01:38:43,831 --> 01:38:47,260
ups and ego and power.
Latrolle battles.

2015
01:38:47,470 --> 01:38:48,303
Sheer value of j dot k dot rowling's.
Harry potter business is worth $25 

2016
01:38:53,540 --> 01:38:55,360
billion.
Whoa.

2017
01:38:55,780 --> 01:38:57,890
Cool.
That seems like a lot.

2018
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:04,000
She's,
she's rolling.

2019
01:39:05,450 --> 01:39:08,530
She's like willing to get married.
How does that,

2020
01:39:08,680 --> 01:39:10,360
how does that work?
I should say the joke.

2021
01:39:10,850 --> 01:39:11,431
A joke.
No,

2022
01:39:11,431 --> 01:39:15,430
I'm going to say no.
You guys know this is live,

2023
01:39:15,431 --> 01:39:18,520
right?
Don't argue over saving jokes.

2024
01:39:18,521 --> 01:39:20,050
Just say the fucking job.
Boom.

2025
01:39:21,580 --> 01:39:22,950
Better be good.
Oh my god.

2026
01:39:23,470 --> 01:39:26,620
You're not boxed.
We hotbox didn't even smoke.

2027
01:39:28,480 --> 01:39:31,420
Don't do it.
Let's just pull out.

2028
01:39:32,950 --> 01:39:36,940
We're about to hit the ocean.
Didn't Harry Potter get down the hill?

2029
01:39:37,230 --> 01:39:37,900
How?

2030
01:39:37,900 --> 01:39:40,020
Walking?
Jk rowling.

2031
01:39:41,010 --> 01:39:43,370
Solid.
I don't understand that.

2032
01:39:44,360 --> 01:39:46,170
It's okay.
We've got to bring up the joke.

2033
01:39:46,171 --> 01:39:47,540
I didn't come up with it.
I heard it.

2034
01:39:47,550 --> 01:39:48,383
Second hand.
Third hand rolling is the punchline of 

2035
01:39:50,581 --> 01:39:53,560
the joke is also the author of the 
famous Harry Potter.

2036
01:39:54,680 --> 01:39:56,760
No,
it's over.

2037
01:39:56,930 --> 01:39:59,100
This is a little rough delivery 
delivery.

2038
01:39:59,230 --> 01:40:04,230
You said walking jk.
Jk meetings.

2039
01:40:07,710 --> 01:40:11,180
Just kidding.
It's okay.

2040
01:40:12,950 --> 01:40:17,950
I'm so glad you told that on joe's desk 
jokes.

2041
01:40:19,291 --> 01:40:23,270
I love stupid jokes.
Get at me.

2042
01:40:27,070 --> 01:40:27,903
Hey,
tell me about this fucking crazy guitar 

2043
01:40:29,521 --> 01:40:33,240
you guys have that somebody gave you.
Wound the national.

2044
01:40:33,390 --> 01:40:35,170
What happened?
What?

2045
01:40:35,220 --> 01:40:37,890
What happened with that guitar?
That thing's insane.

2046
01:40:38,080 --> 01:40:38,913
Beautiful guitar.
There's a company called national and 

2047
01:40:41,460 --> 01:40:45,960
they thing is the same look and gave us 
one because,

2048
01:40:45,990 --> 01:40:48,060
well I think they like us,
but they also like you,

2049
01:40:48,080 --> 01:40:48,913
I was a part of it.
We have to admit that I didn't do 

2050
01:40:51,481 --> 01:40:53,850
anything but thank you.
Them they made.

2051
01:40:53,910 --> 01:40:54,110
That's

2052
01:40:54,110 --> 01:40:56,380
a crazy looking guitar that's not 
normally taught resonator.

2053
01:40:56,390 --> 01:40:58,390
So it has.
I can't actually remember.

2054
01:40:58,510 --> 01:40:59,343
I think it has tricon resonators showing
the fact that you want to hear some 

2055
01:41:02,681 --> 01:41:03,600
music.
Is that what you're getting?

2056
01:41:03,601 --> 01:41:04,121
No,
no.

2057
01:41:04,121 --> 01:41:05,740
I want to see that guitar.
That's,

2058
01:41:06,520 --> 01:41:08,130
that's it right there.
No,

2059
01:41:08,140 --> 01:41:12,010
that's not it.
But it's hard now.

2060
01:41:12,220 --> 01:41:14,970
I thought a guitar had to be made at of 
wood.

2061
01:41:16,200 --> 01:41:18,670
I mean,
well this is technically a.

2062
01:41:18,671 --> 01:41:21,220
Well,
it's a different kind of guitar.

2063
01:41:21,340 --> 01:41:26,340
Some call them dobo definitely not 
claiming any cone inside of.

2064
01:41:26,390 --> 01:41:29,020
I feel like I want ben here so I don't 
look this up.

2065
01:41:29,021 --> 01:41:29,854
But um,
there's a resonator inside like a 

2066
01:41:32,291 --> 01:41:33,124
speaker inside of see,
see how there's all this kind of mesh 

2067
01:41:37,210 --> 01:41:40,060
look.
Will you go back up that one?

2068
01:41:40,090 --> 01:41:40,923
Yeah,
that.

2069
01:41:40,930 --> 01:41:41,763
Okay.
That's like a built in speaker and you 

2070
01:41:43,361 --> 01:41:45,940
can plug them in so they're electric as 
a speaker,

2071
01:41:45,941 --> 01:41:48,850
like a car speaker,
like a stereo speaker.

2072
01:41:49,330 --> 01:41:51,020
I'm not necessarily.
No,

2073
01:41:51,160 --> 01:41:54,070
I mean it's a.
Without electronics.

2074
01:41:54,190 --> 01:41:55,023
There's a cone inside is that the sound 
resonates louder like a banjo kind of a 

2075
01:42:00,431 --> 01:42:01,960
little bit.
But um,

2076
01:42:01,990 --> 01:42:05,220
so it's not like a,
like a stereo special.

2077
01:42:05,230 --> 01:42:07,450
I'm really sorry if I just put your 
power,

2078
01:42:07,500 --> 01:42:09,080
the pitch.
Well jamie's a,

2079
01:42:09,300 --> 01:42:10,480
the actual audio

2080
01:42:10,580 --> 01:42:11,413
powered,
but it has a specific tone to it that 

2081
01:42:13,521 --> 01:42:17,330
isn't like your,
your regular acoustic or electric guitar

2082
01:42:17,570 --> 01:42:18,403
and when you plug it in it sounds 
amazing and it has sort of like a down 

2083
01:42:21,231 --> 01:42:22,820
homey vibe and it's beautiful.

2084
01:42:24,180 --> 01:42:29,180
Not interesting down homey vibe like 
down home me music,

2085
01:42:31,230 --> 01:42:34,380
like acoustic music is like down homie 
music,

2086
01:42:34,381 --> 01:42:35,214
right?

2087
01:42:35,470 --> 01:42:36,700
Well,
um,

2088
01:42:37,120 --> 01:42:41,330
yeah,
I mean folk music and soul music or down

2089
01:42:41,331 --> 01:42:41,790
home,

2090
01:42:41,790 --> 01:42:45,360
resonator for guitar cover,
cover plate for biscuit.

2091
01:42:45,900 --> 01:42:48,480
Butchered the whole explanation of what 
an nationalism.

2092
01:42:49,010 --> 01:42:50,520
She nailed it.
She nailed it.

2093
01:42:50,700 --> 01:42:52,590
Okay.
So is there any word on that as the back

2094
01:42:52,591 --> 01:42:55,420
of that thing and the headstock and the 
neck?

2095
01:42:55,530 --> 01:42:57,970
I'm going to pee,
but the body's metal.

2096
01:42:58,140 --> 01:42:58,973
That thing's insane looking man.
And so what kind of a different sound 

2097
01:43:04,260 --> 01:43:06,620
does this thing make than a regular 
guitar?

2098
01:43:08,990 --> 01:43:13,990
Wow.
So it's louder.

2099
01:43:14,910 --> 01:43:17,010
It cuts a lot more.
It's more resonant.

2100
01:43:17,280 --> 01:43:20,160
It's got a metal sound to it.
Yes,

2101
01:43:20,161 --> 01:43:22,930
sure.
So one,

2102
01:43:23,340 --> 01:43:25,290
if I had a slide.
These things are great for plants.

2103
01:43:25,291 --> 01:43:30,291
Slide with a because jamie,
what do you got?

2104
01:43:31,160 --> 01:43:33,000
A lighter?
Probably fucked it up,

2105
01:43:33,540 --> 01:43:36,340
but you can kind of wander around one or
a flat round,

2106
01:43:37,320 --> 01:43:42,320
but you can kind hear it.
Maybe sound like shit,

2107
01:43:42,601 --> 01:43:45,150
but you know what I mean.
Like some old school blue shit.

2108
01:43:45,151 --> 01:43:48,020
What does that.
There are some around.

2109
01:43:48,030 --> 01:43:53,030
Let's try that round cigar thing cohiba 
whenever I hear that kind of shit.

2110
01:43:57,471 --> 01:44:01,380
I think of blues.
Yeah.

2111
01:44:01,500 --> 01:44:04,940
Because all that Robert Johnson stuff 
slide all that.

2112
01:44:04,941 --> 01:44:06,260
He probably didn't have resonated 
though.

2113
01:44:06,950 --> 01:44:07,960
Wow.
Yeah.

2114
01:44:08,170 --> 01:44:10,190
That's a complaint site,
but it's a.

2115
01:44:20,430 --> 01:44:22,500
Are you with John Lee hooker?
Oh yeah.

2116
01:44:22,620 --> 01:44:27,620
My is he still around maybe 10 years 
ago.

2117
01:44:30,411 --> 01:44:31,244
Like an eight because he was old.
He was playing when he's in his 

2118
01:44:32,331 --> 01:44:33,164
nineties.
I didn't discover them until it was 

2119
01:44:36,681 --> 01:44:39,260
probably in his eighties.
Boom,

2120
01:44:39,290 --> 01:44:40,011
boom,
boom,

2121
01:44:40,011 --> 01:44:40,844
boom.
Oh,

2122
01:44:43,490 --> 01:44:44,900
he could.
You know what this is.

2123
01:44:45,220 --> 01:44:46,970
This will be big upside on.
Gary.

2124
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:48,980
When I thought we said gary for the 
first time,

2125
01:44:49,420 --> 01:44:51,710
he was just acoustic.
We played the show with him.

2126
01:44:51,711 --> 01:44:52,544
This was like 2011 or something and he 
made me feel like John Lee hooker 

2127
01:44:56,630 --> 01:44:57,463
because it was just him and there's this
hypnosis that he can kind of set over 

2128
01:45:01,461 --> 01:45:02,560
you.
Yeah.

2129
01:45:02,561 --> 01:45:04,090
You know,
that's like a real blues.

2130
01:45:04,150 --> 01:45:08,180
That's where you get deeper into it.
These guys could really play that music.

2131
01:45:08,650 --> 01:45:09,830
It's the same thing.
John lee hooker.

2132
01:45:09,831 --> 01:45:11,780
You listened to it and you kind of like 
in trance.

2133
01:45:12,380 --> 01:45:13,213
Jamie,
find my instagram where honey honey had 

2134
01:45:16,190 --> 01:45:20,810
Gary Clark together on stage and you 
guys are doing midnight rider.

2135
01:45:20,811 --> 01:45:23,390
I filmed a little bit of it and put it 
up on instagram.

2136
01:45:24,610 --> 01:45:25,443
It was just so crazy.
I did everything that I hate people 

2137
01:45:26,901 --> 01:45:27,860
doing a comedy clubs.

2138
01:45:33,210 --> 01:45:38,210
There's my hat.
Listen to Gary Clark lyrics,

2139
01:46:31,191 --> 01:46:32,950
but let me just explain this ass

2140
01:46:33,250 --> 01:46:36,550
off so much crap.
Know the words to this song.

2141
01:46:36,590 --> 01:46:40,930
They impromptu song live on stage in 
front of all these people.

2142
01:46:41,340 --> 01:46:42,880
She had to check her phone for the 
lyrics.

2143
01:46:42,900 --> 01:46:46,600
I had to block some dude who was being 
such a fucking cock and I was like,

2144
01:46:46,601 --> 01:46:48,640
I'm sorry,
don't mention I'm not going to.

2145
01:46:48,690 --> 01:46:50,520
I tension.
Screw that dude.

2146
01:46:50,870 --> 01:46:54,090
But you know,
whatever shit happens,

2147
01:46:54,120 --> 01:46:55,500
you know,
it was such a fun night.

2148
01:46:55,920 --> 01:46:56,753
We did a song I didn't know and I wanted
to sing the words properly and I had to 

2149
01:46:59,551 --> 01:47:00,384
look them up on my phone but thought I 
was texting some dude and that wasn't 

2150
01:47:03,151 --> 01:47:05,370
the case.
Thousands of people enjoyed that.

2151
01:47:05,400 --> 01:47:08,700
One or two were cons and you're focusing
on the wrong or.

2152
01:47:08,790 --> 01:47:10,080
Thank you joe.
Thank you.

2153
01:47:10,190 --> 01:47:12,510
So you've always been on social media,
yoda,

2154
01:47:12,600 --> 01:47:13,433
you know,
put out the right vibe and get the fuck 

2155
01:47:19,441 --> 01:47:22,330
out of dodge and shit gets weird 
getaway.

2156
01:47:22,390 --> 01:47:23,223
You don't try it.
You can't control and you definitely 

2157
01:47:24,271 --> 01:47:25,830
can't argue with that.
Right?

2158
01:47:25,860 --> 01:47:29,670
And it's,
it is an effort to not care because I.

2159
01:47:29,710 --> 01:47:31,140
But you do care.
We should all care.

2160
01:47:31,640 --> 01:47:35,880
I just love people.
I really do like a really shitty person.

2161
01:47:35,900 --> 01:47:38,160
It's,
it's hard and I want to love that person

2162
01:47:38,161 --> 01:47:38,701
too,
I think,

2163
01:47:38,701 --> 01:47:41,310
but it's not about karen.
It's because you're going to care.

2164
01:47:41,340 --> 01:47:42,173
It's about recognizing what that person 
is and then not letting him into your 

2165
01:47:44,611 --> 01:47:45,740
house.
Agreed.

2166
01:47:45,860 --> 01:47:47,250
I agree.
You know what that is?

2167
01:47:47,251 --> 01:47:49,620
It's a dummy.
They just want to get mad about stuff.

2168
01:47:49,860 --> 01:47:50,693
Especially if you found out what it was 
that you were just checking the lyrics 

2169
01:47:53,101 --> 01:47:53,934
to a song that you'd never sang before 
and was singing live with Gary Clark jr 

2170
01:47:57,980 --> 01:48:02,430
in front of him and it was like midnight
in downtown la and some weird ass bar.

2171
01:48:03,470 --> 01:48:06,900
That was bad.
It makes me want to move to downtown la.

2172
01:48:07,450 --> 01:48:08,283
Live like batman,
so sort of a warehouse and have a 

2173
01:48:13,860 --> 01:48:15,350
english dude.
Watch this shit over.

2174
01:48:15,850 --> 01:48:19,830
He's put boundaries on.
Happy to hear from the outside.

2175
01:48:19,831 --> 01:48:20,820
You don't know him,
man.

2176
01:48:20,850 --> 01:48:24,140
You might think you're unhappy.
All those musicians.

2177
01:48:27,220 --> 01:48:28,053
Fuck.
How do you feel like all the movies or 

2178
01:48:30,331 --> 01:48:31,164
going into how bummed out he was all the
time because he can't share what he's 

2179
01:48:33,751 --> 01:48:35,980
doing because secret.
Yeah,

2180
01:48:36,010 --> 01:48:38,520
exactly.
He needs a couple of good friends.

2181
01:48:38,550 --> 01:48:39,660
He can't get the validation.
Yeah.

2182
01:48:39,661 --> 01:48:42,720
He's got one old british friend and 
funny.

2183
01:48:42,840 --> 01:48:44,340
He just needs more friends.
Yeah.

2184
01:48:44,620 --> 01:48:45,453
Like if I was batman,
I feel like I can tell you and you 

2185
01:48:46,861 --> 01:48:48,480
wouldn't tell anybody.
You're absolutely right.

2186
01:48:49,040 --> 01:48:52,650
You already are batman because people 
just didn't know.

2187
01:48:52,651 --> 01:48:53,750
Did you ever see that?
There was a.

2188
01:48:54,160 --> 01:48:56,130
Oh,
I guess I was actually comic book.

2189
01:48:56,160 --> 01:49:01,160
It was a a forgetful professor was a 
professor and in the comic book this guy

2190
01:49:02,101 --> 01:49:02,934
was.
He was forgetful about all these 

2191
01:49:05,071 --> 01:49:07,260
different things,
but he's like super genius professor and

2192
01:49:07,261 --> 01:49:11,370
at the end of the comic book he 
recognized that he was actually an alien

2193
01:49:11,371 --> 01:49:15,360
from another planet come that came down 
to earth to help us innovate,

2194
01:49:15,510 --> 01:49:16,343
but he forgot to jail for an alien from 
another planet because you know it's 

2195
01:49:27,781 --> 01:49:28,614
true.
You guys should do more of those weird 

2196
01:49:31,321 --> 01:49:34,200
little downtown shows though.
We should shut.

2197
01:49:34,210 --> 01:49:35,580
Those were fun.
Those were.

2198
01:49:35,581 --> 01:49:37,210
That was so strange.
It was really fun.

2199
01:49:37,211 --> 01:49:37,920
Night,
midnight,

2200
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:39,510
and it was so great because you were 
there.

2201
01:49:39,590 --> 01:49:40,530
That's.
It was great.

2202
01:49:40,531 --> 01:49:41,820
What a great time.
It was awesome.

2203
01:49:41,990 --> 01:49:43,890
It was fun.
It was pretty fucking bad ass.

2204
01:49:43,891 --> 01:49:44,724
Yeah.
That was amazing.

2205
01:49:44,730 --> 01:49:46,830
Intimate shows are so big.
They're so,

2206
01:49:47,380 --> 01:49:47,980
you know,
like you

2207
01:49:47,980 --> 01:49:51,340
almost kind of have to do them.
Like if you just j lo,

2208
01:49:51,341 --> 01:49:52,174
the whole thing and you're on these big 
gas giant stages for the rest of your 

2209
01:49:55,180 --> 01:49:56,040
life.
Giants.

2210
01:49:56,130 --> 01:49:58,710
Even when I'm mad if she's doing 
anything,

2211
01:49:58,780 --> 01:50:00,910
she's going to be like separated from 
everybody.

2212
01:50:01,200 --> 01:50:02,033
Right.
The throwing couldn't close to rose 

2213
01:50:04,451 --> 01:50:05,960
pedals that are feet and shit.
Yeah,

2214
01:50:06,170 --> 01:50:10,170
I mean I think that was as attractive to
that is.

2215
01:50:10,570 --> 01:50:11,403
Hold on.
There's the counterpoint is that 

2216
01:50:14,531 --> 01:50:15,364
thought.
Seems like that's like the worst thing 

2217
01:50:17,261 --> 01:50:18,094
that could ever happen to you because it
gets so separated for everybody that 

2218
01:50:20,681 --> 01:50:21,514
you're like,
I'll put some giant ass stage and 

2219
01:50:23,110 --> 01:50:25,270
everywhere you go you can interact with 
people,

2220
01:50:25,590 --> 01:50:29,500
make all that Roger Waters last or two 
weeks ago.

2221
01:50:29,501 --> 01:50:31,510
And it was incredible.
Tony,

2222
01:50:31,511 --> 01:50:33,200
when he said it was insane.
Oh my god.

2223
01:50:33,640 --> 01:50:35,570
And I think,
I think there's a.

2224
01:50:35,740 --> 01:50:37,070
Well,
I mean it's,

2225
01:50:37,710 --> 01:50:38,543
it's,
there's a reason that he's doing what 

2226
01:50:40,001 --> 01:50:40,834
he's doing and people are coming to see 
him because it's incredible and it's 

2227
01:50:43,091 --> 01:50:43,924
authentic and it's raw and like that man
has obviously he has teams around him 

2228
01:50:47,891 --> 01:50:48,940
that helped build that show.

2229
01:50:48,940 --> 01:50:52,720
He doesn't do that by himself,
but it was,

2230
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:56,980
oh man,
it wasn't white rose pedals.

2231
01:50:57,630 --> 01:51:01,600
It was definitely a different thing.
That's a different thing.

2232
01:51:01,750 --> 01:51:03,490
Well,
not that fast food thing we were kind of

2233
01:51:03,491 --> 01:51:06,160
talking about earlier and I think 
there's a place for that too.

2234
01:51:06,161 --> 01:51:08,800
Sometimes you're fucking starving and 
you need something right now.

2235
01:51:09,160 --> 01:51:12,940
There's also like a lot of money in 
being that icon,

2236
01:51:12,970 --> 01:51:14,560
that diva,
that thing,

2237
01:51:14,590 --> 01:51:15,423
you know,
it's like it's very attractive position 

2238
01:51:16,991 --> 01:51:17,824
to try to attain.
It's almost like you just run a little 

2239
01:51:21,101 --> 01:51:23,930
clue to close to the sun,
burn the wax off your waist,

2240
01:51:23,931 --> 01:51:26,680
and some of it's authentic in.
Some of it is totally.

2241
01:51:26,681 --> 01:51:27,514
You are a machine,
you are part of the manufactured 

2242
01:51:29,800 --> 01:51:33,910
idealism that you represent and that is 
a heavy burden.

2243
01:51:33,940 --> 01:51:34,890
I don't,
but you know,

2244
01:51:34,900 --> 01:51:37,600
it's probably not on anybody who 
probably not enough.

2245
01:51:37,600 --> 01:51:40,330
Antick is people's ambition to get 
there.

2246
01:51:40,570 --> 01:51:44,500
I think the people in those positions 
are so fucking ravenous for that kind of

2247
01:51:44,501 --> 01:51:45,334
attention and that's the only way you 
would possibly climb to the top of that 

2248
01:51:47,771 --> 01:51:50,770
mountain.
You don't be fucking focused.

2249
01:51:51,480 --> 01:51:54,580
I think some people are are manipulated.
I don't know.

2250
01:51:54,581 --> 01:51:55,660
I think some people,
jackson,

2251
01:51:55,810 --> 01:51:56,643
I think some people have an idea of the 
art and they're also exploited within 

2252
01:52:00,161 --> 01:52:00,994
that realm because some parts of the 
record industry are fucking insidious 

2253
01:52:05,910 --> 01:52:06,743
and they take like.
Remember you were talking about that 

2254
01:52:08,291 --> 01:52:11,920
documentary with these 15 year old kids 
that were so talented,

2255
01:52:12,160 --> 01:52:16,630
but they were clearly just getting just 
sucked into the thing.

2256
01:52:16,990 --> 01:52:17,823
You're too young,
you're too young to know what you're 

2257
01:52:18,971 --> 01:52:20,410
doing.
There's just no if,

2258
01:52:20,411 --> 01:52:21,244
ands or buts about it.
In order to make the decision to be a 

2259
01:52:23,200 --> 01:52:26,620
giant like Michael Jackson when we were 
talking about jackson five earlier,

2260
01:52:26,950 --> 01:52:30,700
like when you sing an abc,
I mean he was a fucking baby.

2261
01:52:30,940 --> 01:52:34,600
He was baby baby and he was on tv.
You know,

2262
01:52:34,660 --> 01:52:36,580
he was on.
He was a huge star,

2263
01:52:36,610 --> 01:52:37,443
but also he had his family running the 
show and it was like a really fucked up 

2264
01:52:40,391 --> 01:52:43,000
dynamic and so it was almost like his.
I mean,

2265
01:52:43,090 --> 01:52:44,920
don't get me wrong,
his talent was undeniable,

2266
01:52:44,930 --> 01:52:46,340
but like his family

2267
01:52:46,340 --> 01:52:48,380
were the record industry in that 
respect.

2268
01:52:48,381 --> 01:52:48,650
Yeah.

2269
01:52:48,650 --> 01:52:53,370
Whose talent was so undeniable that he 
was the youngest one and he got to sing.

2270
01:52:53,850 --> 01:52:58,290
Could you imagine you grew up with four 
bad motherfuckers as brothers.

2271
01:52:58,291 --> 01:53:01,860
Your dad is a professional musician and 
you are so good.

2272
01:53:01,861 --> 01:53:02,320
They're like,
okay,

2273
01:53:02,320 --> 01:53:03,153
let him say like everybody else wants to
want them to saying they all did their 

2274
01:53:06,271 --> 01:53:07,104
solo projects afterwards.
They didn't say shit while michael had 

2275
01:53:09,901 --> 01:53:11,480
the microphone.
Just like I'm saying,

2276
01:53:11,990 --> 01:53:16,050
I'm saying just let him sing and people 
reacted to them real way.

2277
01:53:16,051 --> 01:53:16,561
Right?
I mean,

2278
01:53:16,561 --> 01:53:17,450
that's what,
oh man,

2279
01:53:17,700 --> 01:53:20,010
you know,
there's the exploitative aspect and then

2280
01:53:20,011 --> 01:53:21,840
it's like everybody want to fucking see 
him sing.

2281
01:53:21,841 --> 01:53:23,970
I wish I saw him saying it was two 
things,

2282
01:53:24,060 --> 01:53:26,820
right?
It was this emergence of this incredible

2283
01:53:26,821 --> 01:53:27,654
sound that came out of this one person 
and all the different projects that he 

2284
01:53:30,061 --> 01:53:32,940
was involved in and then it was also the
tragic,

2285
01:53:33,570 --> 01:53:34,403
almost like decimating of a potential 
life because his life only existed so 

2286
01:53:39,481 --> 01:53:42,620
strongly in the public eye that it 
didn't exist anywhere else in the,

2287
01:53:42,621 --> 01:53:44,670
in a normal form outside.

2288
01:53:44,670 --> 01:53:45,503
It was just a chaos,
a mess of hanging out with kids and 

2289
01:53:48,300 --> 01:53:49,133
weird relationships with women that 
didn't seem real and living in an 

2290
01:53:52,201 --> 01:53:54,060
amusement park.
It was just a mess.

2291
01:53:54,090 --> 01:53:54,923
It was just a total disaster.
Like everything outside of the magic 

2292
01:53:59,281 --> 01:54:02,640
that he did in the public eye was just 
hell.

2293
01:54:03,120 --> 01:54:06,150
It's really weird because what he did in
the public eye,

2294
01:54:06,210 --> 01:54:09,270
like thriller and beat it and all those 
different things.

2295
01:54:09,271 --> 01:54:11,940
I mean they were so,
so intense.

2296
01:54:12,180 --> 01:54:13,013
Like I was in high school when all that 
stuff was going on and I remember just 

2297
01:54:17,260 --> 01:54:20,250
just watching like thriller on 
television,

2298
01:54:20,280 --> 01:54:21,270
you know,
when they had the premiere,

2299
01:54:21,271 --> 01:54:24,090
the music video and everybody sat around
and watched thriller when it came out.

2300
01:54:24,091 --> 01:54:28,000
There's nothing like that ever ever.
It was crazy.

2301
01:54:28,020 --> 01:54:30,990
Like sorta like when hendrix came along,
there was nothing like that before.

2302
01:54:31,200 --> 01:54:32,520
Well,
when Michael Jackson came along,

2303
01:54:32,550 --> 01:54:34,030
there was nothing like that before 
either.

2304
01:54:34,031 --> 01:54:35,160
You're like,
what the fuck?

2305
01:54:35,340 --> 01:54:36,173
Like someone had taken the whole thing 
and put it into this totally new 

2306
01:54:38,581 --> 01:54:42,750
package.
Whereas this feminine guy and he had one

2307
01:54:42,751 --> 01:54:45,630
glove on and he was dancing and 
everybody wanted to move like,

2308
01:54:45,631 --> 01:54:46,141
um,
and I was like,

2309
01:54:46,141 --> 01:54:47,200
what in the fuck is

2310
01:54:48,150 --> 01:54:48,983
back to your,
like freddie mercury kinda dick out 

2311
01:54:50,611 --> 01:54:51,444
thing.
It's like he did what he wanted to do 

2312
01:54:54,121 --> 01:54:56,610
and he wasn't,
he was iconic because of it.

2313
01:54:57,030 --> 01:54:58,440
I think that's,
that's part of it.

2314
01:54:58,441 --> 01:55:01,020
It's like you just have to own it.
Well,

2315
01:55:01,030 --> 01:55:01,270
what he

2316
01:55:01,270 --> 01:55:06,270
did it on a level that was undeniable,
just like you talked about before,

2317
01:55:06,971 --> 01:55:09,370
because he,
because of his ambition,

2318
01:55:09,400 --> 01:55:13,570
it wasn't just I'm going to be me.
It was like I'm going gonna be me to the

2319
01:55:13,571 --> 01:55:17,320
furthest extent that I possibly fucking 
can and this is what happened.

2320
01:55:17,620 --> 01:55:19,510
You know what I mean?
I have a friend who went to his house up

2321
01:55:19,511 --> 01:55:20,344
in los olivos and they went,
they toward his dance studio and he had 

2322
01:55:24,671 --> 01:55:25,504
this private dance studio in this mirror
is against the wall and there's this 

2323
01:55:27,101 --> 01:55:29,650
groove in the floor and this is,
you know,

2324
01:55:29,651 --> 01:55:30,484
he was later in his life at this point,
but he had worn out a part of the floor 

2325
01:55:33,370 --> 01:55:35,320
from just practicing his shit.
Wow.

2326
01:55:35,390 --> 01:55:38,050
This is way beyond his teens and 
twenties.

2327
01:55:38,080 --> 01:55:41,710
That's just who he was all the time.
You know,

2328
01:55:41,750 --> 01:55:44,040
people don't respect a song.
Dragon

2329
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:49,040
attack,
attack.

2330
01:55:49,530 --> 01:55:53,660
I know the troll song ogre battle your 
battle.

2331
01:55:53,680 --> 01:55:54,513
It's one of those songs to people for 
god and he will play with the people on 

2332
01:55:58,141 --> 01:55:59,940
youtube can hear it and we'll probably 
have to.

2333
01:56:00,230 --> 01:56:01,410
We can play it for us though,
right?

2334
01:56:01,860 --> 01:56:06,330
We have to do some fancy editing,
probably control for everything.

2335
01:56:06,331 --> 01:56:11,120
We show a video of a caterpillar and we 
get yanked off youtube the last time we.

2336
01:56:11,210 --> 01:56:14,280
We get yanked off youtube for stuff like
when,

2337
01:56:14,310 --> 01:56:15,143
when we put things on the air that are 
on youtube that someone else has 

2338
01:56:18,660 --> 01:56:20,520
listened to this.
This is.

2339
01:56:21,390 --> 01:56:24,710
This is dragging attack.
People don't.

2340
01:56:24,910 --> 01:56:27,420
They don't remember this.
Just think about.

2341
01:56:27,450 --> 01:56:32,450
Give me some volume.
Like come on math at dick's.

2342
01:56:35,881 --> 01:56:38,940
Just out.
Oh my god.

2343
01:56:45,160 --> 01:56:50,160
Come on mastic.
It's forgotten.

2344
01:56:52,601 --> 01:56:54,370
Classic.
You have to have.

2345
01:56:54,371 --> 01:56:57,190
Brian may gets better on your podcast.
Who?

2346
01:56:57,760 --> 01:57:02,760
Pick a time.
Dicks out out what?

2347
01:57:21,580 --> 01:57:24,790
Come on.
Get it feels so good.

2348
01:57:30,600 --> 01:57:31,820
All right.
We'll have to fade out here.

2349
01:57:31,840 --> 01:57:32,930
Gonna.
Have to face in trouble.

2350
01:57:34,070 --> 01:57:35,060
Come on.
Dragging.

2351
01:57:35,061 --> 01:57:36,090
Attack people.
Slept

2352
01:57:36,090 --> 01:57:39,390
on dragon attacks.
The queen's best songs.

2353
01:57:39,450 --> 01:57:42,680
it's just occurred to me right now.
What does that sound?

2354
01:57:42,690 --> 01:57:44,960
Do you hear that?
What does that check to see?

2355
01:57:44,970 --> 01:57:47,460
Does car.
This is the cigar feds.

2356
01:57:48,330 --> 01:57:49,970
It's the building.
Oh no,

2357
01:57:49,990 --> 01:57:52,280
I was there.
Fire alarm sound.

2358
01:57:53,100 --> 01:57:53,911
oh,
it's probably next door.

2359
01:57:53,911 --> 01:57:55,420
I was getting robbed.
Listen,

2360
01:57:55,430 --> 01:57:57,320
keep it together.
I've got to intervene.

2361
01:57:57,360 --> 01:57:58,980
Guys.
What kind of weapons do you have in this

2362
01:57:58,981 --> 01:57:59,581
place?
Oh,

2363
01:57:59,581 --> 01:58:04,581
we got joe rogan faces our human weapon.
Definitely not.

2364
01:58:06,190 --> 01:58:08,640
His bullets.
Codes are super hard to defend against.

2365
01:58:09,360 --> 01:58:13,140
Shit.
I saw her last night.

2366
01:58:13,350 --> 01:58:13,981
Baby driver.
Yeah.

2367
01:58:13,981 --> 01:58:16,320
You were saying earlier.
Everyone needs to see it.

2368
01:58:16,470 --> 01:58:19,620
That's what I keep hearing.
Incredible music and just a great story.

2369
01:58:19,960 --> 01:58:23,430
It's,
you guys hear that sound,

2370
01:58:23,730 --> 01:58:24,563
that sound.
A background is preventing us from 

2371
01:58:25,591 --> 01:58:29,090
playing you beautiful harmonious music.
Well,

2372
01:58:29,170 --> 01:58:34,170
we just can't keep trying to ask him,
what do you want to ask?

2373
01:58:36,330 --> 01:58:38,910
If you have got to get brian me on your 
podcast,

2374
01:58:39,330 --> 01:58:40,680
I would love to.
What's uh,

2375
01:58:40,770 --> 01:58:41,603
what's going on young jeremy.
Nobody's next door and the alarms going 

2376
01:58:44,351 --> 01:58:45,970
off.
So this'll be going on forever.

2377
01:58:46,990 --> 01:58:51,510
We're moving into a rap song like nwa,
you know,

2378
01:58:51,511 --> 01:58:53,220
his like,
you know,

2379
01:58:53,221 --> 01:58:54,054
we can kind of just imagine that these 
things have a time limit where they're 

2380
01:58:57,480 --> 01:59:00,090
allowed to stay on.
I don't know about that.

2381
01:59:00,150 --> 01:59:03,360
The alert needs to find out fervent and.

2382
01:59:05,580 --> 01:59:07,510
Yeah.
But what happens when we weren't here?

2383
01:59:07,511 --> 01:59:08,344
So it goes back on and then the security
people have to come and what's next 

2384
01:59:13,241 --> 01:59:15,220
door?
Is it worth checking out?

2385
01:59:15,221 --> 01:59:16,054
Boom.
No,

2386
01:59:16,330 --> 01:59:18,370
it's not anything exciting.
Bunch of shit.

2387
01:59:18,760 --> 01:59:22,220
I don't know what happened.
We might have to wrap this bitch up.

2388
01:59:23,590 --> 01:59:25,400
Can we talk through that?
Sure.

2389
01:59:27,520 --> 01:59:28,353
What's that?
Give me like a minute or two and I'll 

2390
01:59:29,771 --> 01:59:31,250
see if there's someone out there that's 
gonna unlock.

2391
01:59:31,270 --> 01:59:32,081
Okay.
Stop it soon,

2392
01:59:32,081 --> 01:59:34,720
but yeah,
when I was going to happen,

2393
01:59:34,790 --> 01:59:36,690
this could be one of our shortest pot.
Oh,

2394
01:59:36,691 --> 01:59:38,800
I don't know how long we've been going.
We've been going for awhile.

2395
01:59:38,860 --> 01:59:39,830
Thirty four,
30.

2396
01:59:40,310 --> 01:59:41,760
We've been going since two.
Right?

2397
01:59:45,620 --> 01:59:48,980
There's probably not a lot of people 
working today because today's monday,

2398
01:59:48,981 --> 01:59:49,814
the third.
Tomorrow's the fourth people Just say 

2399
01:59:50,991 --> 01:59:51,890
fuck,
fuck.

2400
01:59:51,891 --> 01:59:54,440
Monday.
Then know and get that extRa day.

2401
01:59:55,970 --> 01:59:56,803
Independence day.
Tomorrow's the day where people are 

2402
01:59:58,611 --> 02:00:01,520
going to do some stupid shit.
Was fireworks you doing tomorrow?

2403
02:00:01,990 --> 02:00:05,060
Gorilla.
That's great.

2404
02:00:05,260 --> 02:00:10,260
Are you doing later tonight?
Tonight we're going to grill some access

2405
02:00:11,771 --> 02:00:14,120
dear.
So fresh from Hawaii.

2406
02:00:14,180 --> 02:00:15,013
Oh my god.
How did you get you just ship it with 

2407
02:00:17,361 --> 02:00:19,090
you on the plane.
Is it sort of special?

2408
02:00:19,130 --> 02:00:19,963
You just freeze it,
freeze it before you take them back and 

2409
02:00:22,330 --> 02:00:23,830
put in the cooler.
wow.

2410
02:00:24,050 --> 02:00:24,883
Yeah.
Just do you have your permanent for a 

2411
02:00:28,131 --> 02:00:30,740
certain number of deer that you can.
Not in lanai.

2412
02:00:30,890 --> 02:00:32,630
In lanai,
they don't have any predators,

2413
02:00:32,660 --> 02:00:34,130
so you could really.
I only shot one of them.

2414
02:00:34,131 --> 02:00:34,964
They're really hard to get with a bow 
and arrow and it's hard to get close to 

2415
02:00:36,771 --> 02:00:37,730
them.
They're super.

2416
02:00:37,731 --> 02:00:39,590
Well they.
They evolved with tigers.

2417
02:00:40,490 --> 02:00:41,323
Will these.

2418
02:00:43,180 --> 02:00:46,020
They're so fast.
I this happened more than once.

2419
02:00:46,021 --> 02:00:49,750
I shot at one and it ran away from the 
arrow.

2420
02:00:50,610 --> 02:00:51,443
The arrow is going 200 and switch arrows
because I heavier arrows that go 245 

2421
02:00:56,941 --> 02:00:57,774
feet a second and in the mid hunt we had
to switch to these other errors that go 

2422
02:01:00,901 --> 02:01:01,734
275 feet a second.
I had a gain an extra 30 feet a second 

2423
02:01:04,590 --> 02:01:07,290
because the deer would even then they 
still duct it.

2424
02:01:07,560 --> 02:01:08,393
They would look at the arrow coming 
their way and get the fuck out of dodge 

2425
02:01:11,430 --> 02:01:12,270
bitch.
Are you kidding me?

2426
02:01:12,900 --> 02:01:15,780
I mean,
you're fascinated fast the.

2427
02:01:15,840 --> 02:01:18,710
Because they literally evolved running 
away from tigers.

2428
02:01:20,390 --> 02:01:21,223
Crazy man.
That there's any chance that it's going 

2429
02:01:22,641 --> 02:01:24,920
off anytime soon.
There's no one around.

2430
02:01:25,360 --> 02:01:27,680
We don't have.
We've got issues folks.

2431
02:01:27,760 --> 02:01:28,850
Oh,
we can play with the soundtrack.

2432
02:01:28,900 --> 02:01:30,360
We don't have to play.
We could do.

2433
02:01:30,380 --> 02:01:32,930
We could.
We could definitely just keep doing it.

2434
02:01:33,110 --> 02:01:36,020
Does it bother you that this thing has 
gone kind of faded into the background?

2435
02:01:37,210 --> 02:01:39,650
Weird drinks at this point?
I feel warm.

2436
02:01:43,760 --> 02:01:44,481
Smell,
smoke.

2437
02:01:44,481 --> 02:01:49,481
When we know it sounded russian.
It was a little swampy shapes.

2438
02:01:52,730 --> 02:01:53,563
We want to play some swamps.
I was at this point in time for pool in 

2439
02:01:59,360 --> 02:02:03,550
New York that had a tiger pell,
famous tiger,

2440
02:02:03,560 --> 02:02:04,393
real one real one from the New York.
It's called the explOrer's club places 

2441
02:02:08,511 --> 02:02:11,120
crazy.
Some snm shit.

2442
02:02:11,210 --> 02:02:16,210
Ben can be an s and m,
like a safari type deal.

2443
02:02:19,490 --> 02:02:23,570
Like one of those clubs.
It was like maybe late 18,

2444
02:02:23,571 --> 02:02:28,571
hundreds of teddy roosevelt started this
place with a bunch of bros and they have

2445
02:02:29,870 --> 02:02:30,703
all this taxidermy in this room.
One of them is this pelt of a tiger 

2446
02:02:33,890 --> 02:02:38,890
tigress that killed 48 people in India.
You had this,

2447
02:02:39,200 --> 02:02:40,910
it kind of like,
it was a phenomenon.

2448
02:02:40,911 --> 02:02:45,320
He got a taste for blood and started 
huntIng men.

2449
02:02:46,570 --> 02:02:48,440
People.
I don't know if it was just just men,

2450
02:02:48,530 --> 02:02:49,363
but um,
they had this thing on the wall which 

2451
02:02:51,261 --> 02:02:52,130
was insane.

2452
02:02:52,510 --> 02:02:54,460
You know,
that's a real issue in um,

2453
02:02:54,790 --> 02:02:55,623
in India,
in India there's a one part of this 

2454
02:02:58,191 --> 02:02:59,024
river that's very brackish and the 
tigers drink the salt water and because 

2455
02:03:02,961 --> 02:03:03,794
of the typhoons,
a lot of times they wind up having a 

2456
02:03:06,381 --> 02:03:09,200
bunch of people wash up in the river and
the tigers won a beating people.

2457
02:03:09,470 --> 02:03:11,760
So they developed a pension,
a.

2458
02:03:11,840 --> 02:03:12,600
Yeah,
they did.

2459
02:03:12,600 --> 02:03:15,410
They have a taste for,
for humans to the point where in there,

2460
02:03:15,411 --> 02:03:18,470
this one section of India,
over the past 200 years,

2461
02:03:18,740 --> 02:03:21,480
tigers have killed over 300,000
people.

2462
02:03:22,230 --> 02:03:24,800
People still going there.
It was a bit from one of my specials.

2463
02:03:24,860 --> 02:03:27,710
It was a bit from.
I'm talking monkeys in space.

2464
02:03:28,660 --> 02:03:32,780
It's weird.
it really is true why they lived there.

2465
02:03:32,781 --> 02:03:34,670
The first 100,000,
you're like,

2466
02:03:34,700 --> 02:03:35,533
we should leave.
There's nothing really they could do 

2467
02:03:37,041 --> 02:03:40,400
about it.
It's like they've evolved in that way.

2468
02:03:40,400 --> 02:03:42,650
It'S not just like one main,
you know,

2469
02:03:42,680 --> 02:03:44,060
predatory tiger,
that's all.

2470
02:03:44,090 --> 02:03:44,661
No,
no,

2471
02:03:44,661 --> 02:03:45,291
no.
This many,

2472
02:03:45,291 --> 02:03:45,801
many,
many,

2473
02:03:45,801 --> 02:03:49,100
many tires over hundreds of years the 
tigers had gotten used to eating.

2474
02:03:49,101 --> 02:03:52,400
People like tiger.
Tiger's are particularly ruthless,

2475
02:03:52,730 --> 02:03:54,280
funny story.
When you're like,

2476
02:03:54,390 --> 02:03:56,510
I'm afraid of like sharks don't eat 
people,

2477
02:03:56,511 --> 02:03:58,910
they don't like the way we taste.
How the fuck do you know?

2478
02:03:59,310 --> 02:04:00,330
Yeah,
exactly.

2479
02:04:00,380 --> 02:04:01,550
They just don't.
They don't.

2480
02:04:01,740 --> 02:04:02,840
They can be like,
actually,

2481
02:04:02,841 --> 02:04:05,330
I took a bite and that was fucking 
delicious.

2482
02:04:05,750 --> 02:04:08,240
It's like if you expected you were going
to get cottage cheese,

2483
02:04:08,241 --> 02:04:10,400
but instead you got a cantaloupe,
you'd kind of freak out.

2484
02:04:11,510 --> 02:04:14,460
You might really get into cantaloupes 
after awhile.

2485
02:04:14,570 --> 02:04:19,570
I fucking love divers divers.
Delicious to eat them in the wetsuit.

2486
02:04:21,050 --> 02:04:22,250
Dude.
I don't give a fuck,

2487
02:04:22,940 --> 02:04:23,691
you know?
Well,

2488
02:04:23,691 --> 02:04:24,530
you know,
that's not a seal,

2489
02:04:24,531 --> 02:04:24,921
right?
yeah,

2490
02:04:24,921 --> 02:04:27,680
it's a diver.
It's like you.

2491
02:04:27,681 --> 02:04:28,514
Fuck.

2492
02:04:30,390 --> 02:04:33,620
Yeah.
This one section of this river in India.

2493
02:04:33,710 --> 02:04:36,290
I did this whole bit about it in my,
uh,

2494
02:04:36,320 --> 02:04:41,320
2009 comedy special because it was a 
real story about a boat of people.

2495
02:04:42,060 --> 02:04:45,750
There was five guys in this boat and 
three of them were killed by tigers.

2496
02:04:46,050 --> 02:04:49,320
So the tiger swam out to the boat,
jumped in,

2497
02:04:49,350 --> 02:04:51,540
killed a guy and dragged him into the 
water,

2498
02:04:51,541 --> 02:04:53,970
swam to the shore,
dropped his body off,

2499
02:04:53,980 --> 02:04:57,030
jumped back in the water,
swim out to the boat again,

2500
02:04:57,060 --> 02:05:01,160
got the next guy swam for shore.
He just killed a tiger.

2501
02:05:01,180 --> 02:05:03,930
Hoarders spree.
That's fucked up.

2502
02:05:03,931 --> 02:05:05,370
God.
Damn three guys.

2503
02:05:06,060 --> 02:05:08,010
This is real.
Did he make friends with him?

2504
02:05:08,030 --> 02:05:10,680
Like real?
Totally real.

2505
02:05:11,110 --> 02:05:13,020
I wouldn't lie to you about something so
important.

2506
02:05:13,490 --> 02:05:16,830
That's crazy.
Just stop and think about what that must

2507
02:05:16,831 --> 02:05:19,620
have been like in the last two guns.
My apartment in silver lake.

2508
02:05:19,621 --> 02:05:20,560
God,
the terror.

2509
02:05:22,140 --> 02:05:22,973
That's what we need.
Tigers roaming the streets of silver 

2510
02:05:24,701 --> 02:05:27,790
alert.
We'd let you understand coyotes.

2511
02:05:28,670 --> 02:05:30,660
I parked.
They do stay.

2512
02:05:30,720 --> 02:05:31,553
You guys are close to griffith park.
I should have brought the pamphlet in 

2513
02:05:33,551 --> 02:05:34,384
it.

2514
02:05:36,600 --> 02:05:37,433
Yeah.
That means that the crooks have found 

2515
02:05:39,040 --> 02:05:44,040
the bolts and cutting along feels weird 
now or soon alone.

2516
02:05:48,250 --> 02:05:50,250
So awkward.
There was a guy that I had on,

2517
02:05:50,251 --> 02:05:51,084
there was a wildlife biologist.
It was telling me about the cougar that 

2518
02:05:52,501 --> 02:05:55,650
lives in griffith park and it just.
Just jack's dear.

2519
02:05:56,010 --> 02:05:57,960
That's all he does.
And the occasional dog,

2520
02:05:58,350 --> 02:06:00,570
they end,
they've monitored this cat,

2521
02:06:02,310 --> 02:06:04,620
big cat.
This is a cat.

2522
02:06:04,621 --> 02:06:07,020
They have a photo of him with the 
hollywood sign that by the way,

2523
02:06:07,021 --> 02:06:08,850
we have common.
We have a print of that.

2524
02:06:09,540 --> 02:06:10,373
The the new studio has a collar on,
but it's a wild cougar and they have to 

2525
02:06:15,541 --> 02:06:20,541
capture it every couple of years because
it's color runs out a gps so the battery

2526
02:06:20,641 --> 02:06:21,474
dies and the color.
So they have to find this fucker and 

2527
02:06:22,771 --> 02:06:24,570
then they have to dart them is right 
there.

2528
02:06:25,130 --> 02:06:28,020
See it has this collar and look in the 
background with the hollywood sign.

2529
02:06:28,200 --> 02:06:30,600
That's not planned.
That was just a camera trap.

2530
02:06:30,601 --> 02:06:31,434
Photograph a random pick that collar.
He was looking for arms like franco 

2531
02:06:36,781 --> 02:06:39,660
columbo mean.
That's insane.

2532
02:06:40,490 --> 02:06:41,323
Forums are fucking shit.
The hollywood sign is actually 10 feet 

2533
02:06:44,630 --> 02:06:47,910
but lot.
He looks like the rock.

2534
02:06:47,940 --> 02:06:50,080
He's built like the rock.
No,

2535
02:06:50,190 --> 02:06:52,680
he's building a power lifter.
Almost like his front arm.

2536
02:06:52,681 --> 02:06:57,681
Like the phone guy in the middle to the 
left with that fucking look on his face.

2537
02:06:57,940 --> 02:07:02,940
That same one that sam,
they took a picture of them was edible.

2538
02:07:03,600 --> 02:07:04,770
Yeah,
he eats a lot of edibles,

2539
02:07:04,880 --> 02:07:08,250
you know what I think is just donors.
I think if you eat stoners,

2540
02:07:08,251 --> 02:07:12,150
you get high.
Oh my worst nightmare.

2541
02:07:12,910 --> 02:07:15,120
They have to capture this cat every two 
years.

2542
02:07:15,121 --> 02:07:17,790
Is cat's been captured like four times.
Pretty cute too though.

2543
02:07:18,240 --> 02:07:20,580
I think he had manged their right.
Is that what they captured him?

2544
02:07:20,581 --> 02:07:21,960
That he had some sort of a dIsease?

2545
02:07:21,960 --> 02:07:25,290
they had to work with them on,
but it's so um,

2546
02:07:25,800 --> 02:07:28,320
I think his name is [inaudible] right?
Is that his name?

2547
02:07:28,321 --> 02:07:29,154
That's what they call them.
Like I noted he was severely infected 

2548
02:07:31,201 --> 02:07:32,650
with mange.
Yeah,

2549
02:07:32,950 --> 02:07:34,110
blow.
Sorry dude.

2550
02:07:34,170 --> 02:07:35,890
That sucks.
Intense Life.

2551
02:07:35,920 --> 02:07:38,920
And it's a male and he's out there 
running free.

2552
02:07:38,921 --> 02:07:42,130
That's what's really interesting.
They just let him do what he does.

2553
02:07:42,790 --> 02:07:46,060
He's running the shell.
He's king shit.

2554
02:07:46,270 --> 02:07:47,830
He's defInitely king shit.
If you're a jogger,

2555
02:07:47,980 --> 02:07:48,940
he's like,
simba,

2556
02:07:49,270 --> 02:07:50,750
you just don't want to catch them before
you.

2557
02:07:51,070 --> 02:07:53,560
If he has a limp and he can't take out 
dear anymore,

2558
02:07:53,561 --> 02:07:55,980
that's when you're fucked.
You got to be.

2559
02:07:56,490 --> 02:07:57,323
And he said,
these are the things that are proper 

2560
02:07:59,530 --> 02:08:00,363
running.
When we were in like a yellow stone in 

2561
02:08:02,900 --> 02:08:05,830
and we were driving through,
want to get out of the car,

2562
02:08:06,410 --> 02:08:09,850
there's no stone is a pretty 
fascinating.

2563
02:08:10,030 --> 02:08:10,900
It's beautiful.
I mean,

2564
02:08:10,901 --> 02:08:13,300
we went and saw geysers and all the 
beautiful stuff,

2565
02:08:13,301 --> 02:08:18,301
but like a week later there was some 
hiker that just got killed by a grizzly.

2566
02:08:19,060 --> 02:08:21,130
And it was like,
there was footage of it.

2567
02:08:21,131 --> 02:08:22,100
It was,
there was,

2568
02:08:22,101 --> 02:08:23,520
uh,
there was uh,

2569
02:08:23,770 --> 02:08:25,820
a,
uh,

2570
02:08:26,020 --> 02:08:26,853
not a sheriff that ranger ranger mobio 
wouldn't be a major vehicle went by and 

2571
02:08:32,051 --> 02:08:32,884
the man,
like literally like seconds after the 

2572
02:08:34,391 --> 02:08:35,224
ranger drove by,
this just huge grizzly goes across the 

2573
02:08:37,901 --> 02:08:38,734
path.
And there was a hiker who had his 

2574
02:08:39,761 --> 02:08:42,690
headphones on,
just got here.

2575
02:08:42,760 --> 02:08:43,593
But the kid,
11 year old kid that saved a fishing 

2576
02:08:45,251 --> 02:08:46,084
party yesterday,
no charging grizzly bear at a fishing 

2577
02:08:49,721 --> 02:08:52,930
party.
And this 11 year old kid down in Alaska.

2578
02:08:53,050 --> 02:08:55,180
What gun did down's.
Not a grizzly.

2579
02:08:55,181 --> 02:08:56,014
Technically it's a brown bear,
but they're really the same beer with 

2580
02:08:57,700 --> 02:08:59,680
the grizzly is as a coastal brown bear.

2581
02:08:59,710 --> 02:09:02,680
And what a coastal bears called as a 
brown bear.

2582
02:09:04,060 --> 02:09:07,720
Eleven year old kid charging grizzly 
with one well-placed shot.

2583
02:09:07,721 --> 02:09:09,830
Where is he exactly?
Tell you for it.

2584
02:09:09,850 --> 02:09:12,220
That's the right designation.
Young Harry Potter.

2585
02:09:12,250 --> 02:09:13,810
That's what that hat says.
Where's it?

2586
02:09:13,811 --> 02:09:14,980
Say it was who?
Not.

2587
02:09:14,981 --> 02:09:15,814
Alaska.
Go to go to the map and find out where 

2588
02:09:17,681 --> 02:09:18,520
the fuck.
Who knows?

2589
02:09:19,920 --> 02:09:22,840
11 hoonah.
Alaska.

2590
02:09:22,841 --> 02:09:24,760
The kid lives in hoonah,
Alaska.

2591
02:09:24,940 --> 02:09:27,070
That's amazing.
Equally,

2592
02:09:27,071 --> 02:09:27,904
as sad as it is like way up yonder.
You don't want to see the people die 

2593
02:09:31,961 --> 02:09:33,790
from the bear,
but then you feel bad for the bear.

2594
02:09:33,820 --> 02:09:36,340
That's a.
That's actually a brown bear.

2595
02:09:36,370 --> 02:09:38,650
They're calling it a grizzly,
but it's on the coast.

2596
02:09:39,870 --> 02:09:42,790
I think I might be wrong.
Diana lived in juneau.

2597
02:09:43,230 --> 02:09:44,200
Look,
I'll fucking been.

2598
02:09:44,201 --> 02:09:46,830
Alaska is still go back.
He's coming back.

2599
02:09:47,380 --> 02:09:48,640
It is.
Do.

2600
02:09:48,650 --> 02:09:50,140
I do.
I've been there a bunch.

2601
02:09:50,230 --> 02:09:52,270
I've been there a few times for fishing.

2602
02:09:52,270 --> 02:09:55,000
I did a show there once and fish.
Salmon.

2603
02:09:55,150 --> 02:09:56,470
What?
They're fun fish.

2604
02:09:56,700 --> 02:09:58,120
Sure.
I love to fish.

2605
02:09:58,220 --> 02:09:59,740
Do it.
So does ben.

2606
02:09:59,920 --> 02:10:00,753
Let's start.
Let's do a family vacation planet 

2607
02:10:04,860 --> 02:10:06,990
tonight at our cookout.
That sounds great.

2608
02:10:08,190 --> 02:10:11,230
Just an hour from but I'm.
Alaska is is.

2609
02:10:11,310 --> 02:10:12,143
You know what's really crazy?
The thing that I didn't anticipate how 

2610
02:10:14,231 --> 02:10:15,064
fucking aggressive that mosquitoes are 
here because they only live for like a 

2611
02:10:18,400 --> 02:10:19,250
week.
Oh jesus.

2612
02:10:19,300 --> 02:10:22,930
So When they were exaggerating with a 
week with the staff,

2613
02:10:23,510 --> 02:10:26,920
got to wear the stuff.
Another move is thermacell,

2614
02:10:26,921 --> 02:10:30,880
if you want a thermacell is press a 
button.

2615
02:10:30,881 --> 02:10:33,830
It's an ingenious device that my 
friends,

2616
02:10:33,831 --> 02:10:37,640
the rivets up in alberta told me about 
friends called the rivets rivets,

2617
02:10:37,780 --> 02:10:38,590
jon,
jen,

2618
02:10:38,590 --> 02:10:42,080
jonathan rivett,
hunting guides in alberta.

2619
02:10:42,081 --> 02:10:42,914
But you press this button and it lights 
this little tiny element inside of it 

2620
02:10:48,021 --> 02:10:49,790
and it heats up that blue pack.

2621
02:10:49,790 --> 02:10:52,220
Go back to that thing,
that blue pad.

2622
02:10:52,700 --> 02:10:53,533
You change those out.
After awhile they become white in that 

2623
02:10:55,461 --> 02:10:58,160
blue pad.
Puts out this fine mist.

2624
02:10:58,400 --> 02:10:59,330
No,
it burns.

2625
02:10:59,360 --> 02:11:01,610
It burns off a fine mist that you can't 
detect,

2626
02:11:01,790 --> 02:11:03,920
but fucking mosquitoes don't want no 
part of it.

2627
02:11:04,190 --> 02:11:04,971
Amazing.
Yeah,

2628
02:11:04,971 --> 02:11:06,530
and it makes your dick rowe.
I just made that up,

2629
02:11:07,110 --> 02:11:12,110
but I don't know what to say,
but what does that thermacell.

2630
02:11:12,970 --> 02:11:13,803
Are those heated?
Is that heated or is that reallY in 

2631
02:11:19,360 --> 02:11:22,790
walmart.com?
That goes in your shoe.

2632
02:11:22,820 --> 02:11:27,820
This is a thermos sell foot pad that 
somehow or another rep keeps mosquitoes.

2633
02:11:28,190 --> 02:11:28,911
Maybe not.
Maybe it was.

2634
02:11:28,911 --> 02:11:31,210
He didn't have any color.
Other colors except for,

2635
02:11:31,810 --> 02:11:33,540
I don't know,
good questions.

2636
02:11:34,340 --> 02:11:35,173
Fashion conscious.
When it comes to mosquito protection 

2637
02:11:36,411 --> 02:11:38,450
with looking into when we lived in 
nashville,

2638
02:11:38,540 --> 02:11:39,373
I would have To wear off for sensitive 
skin during the day because I would get 

2639
02:11:43,161 --> 02:11:43,994
bit by mosquitoes all day and people 
would always tell me that I smelled 

2640
02:11:47,120 --> 02:11:48,780
amazing.
Oh,

2641
02:11:49,650 --> 02:11:50,880
it's off.
So I just.

2642
02:11:51,020 --> 02:11:52,840
I write all of my tests with magic 
markers.

2643
02:11:56,700 --> 02:11:57,533
Good pickup.
What smells better than a fresh magic 

2644
02:11:59,911 --> 02:12:04,850
word when you pop the top that I don't 
even know why you like it,

2645
02:12:04,851 --> 02:12:06,140
but you love that.
Smell it.

2646
02:12:06,141 --> 02:12:08,770
Again.
I don't even know what to say.

2647
02:12:09,210 --> 02:12:10,043
Is it true thermacell makes myself and 
just make it dark red myself and stop 

2648
02:12:16,131 --> 02:12:18,350
it.
Thermacell makes some lawn.

2649
02:12:18,410 --> 02:12:21,470
I'm like those little things that you 
stick in the ground,

2650
02:12:21,471 --> 02:12:25,460
like a little lawn lantern,
but they keep mosquitoes away.

2651
02:12:26,340 --> 02:12:28,940
It's the same terms.
So commercial,

2652
02:12:28,970 --> 02:12:29,803
because we have a pretty easy in 
California with the mosquitoes are easy 

2653
02:12:32,270 --> 02:12:33,103
with everything,
fucking everything except for 

2654
02:12:34,270 --> 02:12:35,450
earthquakes.
We get an easy.

2655
02:12:35,451 --> 02:12:36,284
We don't have whether he killed the 
spider in my bedroom in the middle of 

2656
02:12:38,121 --> 02:12:42,260
the night last week,
my curtain window.

2657
02:12:42,890 --> 02:12:46,190
Imagine if you were living in hoonah,
Alaska grizzly bear,

2658
02:12:46,340 --> 02:12:51,240
you caught them out.
The window was right after his app.

2659
02:12:51,360 --> 02:12:55,400
Like if you were like screaming from the
spider and you broke the curtain and you

2660
02:12:55,401 --> 02:12:57,760
looked out the window as the bear was in
full charge it.

2661
02:12:57,770 --> 02:12:59,030
We'll put it all in perspective.
Witness.

2662
02:12:59,031 --> 02:12:59,910
Sure.
What jim like,

2663
02:13:00,110 --> 02:13:02,080
goddammit.
Really didn't have a big deal.

2664
02:13:02,180 --> 02:13:06,950
That's pretty good.
Eleven year old hunter.

2665
02:13:07,540 --> 02:13:10,640
It seems like you've kind of evaluated 
east.

2666
02:13:10,670 --> 02:13:13,340
He's fucking own in that shit.
Bitches are on planes.

2667
02:13:13,341 --> 02:13:14,174
Go out and visit this kid.
There's older women that tend towards 

2668
02:13:16,311 --> 02:13:17,144
pedophilia that are right now grooming.
They just didn't want to wait a few 

2669
02:13:20,210 --> 02:13:20,841
years.
That's what they do.

2670
02:13:20,841 --> 02:13:21,890
No,
they don't want to go to jail.

2671
02:13:22,610 --> 02:13:23,443
So the older girls,
they just become your friend and mentor 

2672
02:13:25,791 --> 02:13:29,230
you for a few years and then when you 
hit 18 they just just sucking.

2673
02:13:29,840 --> 02:13:31,740
That's what they tell you.
That's just telling you.

2674
02:13:32,590 --> 02:13:36,270
That's what I hear because a lot of 
women are realizing wrongly.

2675
02:13:36,270 --> 02:13:38,610
So they get arrested for having sex with
these young boys.

2676
02:13:38,611 --> 02:13:39,444
I think it's just let it go.
But once these women do realize that 

2677
02:13:44,370 --> 02:13:47,170
there's real consequences to it,
what they do is just to friend them.

2678
02:13:47,610 --> 02:13:49,520
They become friends with these kids that
long.

2679
02:13:50,010 --> 02:13:51,060
They hang it.
It's not dark.

2680
02:13:51,061 --> 02:13:52,110
It's only darkness.
Girl.

2681
02:13:52,320 --> 02:13:53,620
Trust us.
Right then.

2682
02:13:54,010 --> 02:13:56,400
Sure.
Oh your way around a woman's heart.

2683
02:13:56,490 --> 02:13:59,130
You have an issue that she's 25.
She really likes you.

2684
02:13:59,131 --> 02:14:04,131
She teaches you art and crafts and,
and how skilled ceramicist she's really,

2685
02:14:05,030 --> 02:14:09,930
she's really good at making ashtrays and
so I get it.

2686
02:14:10,560 --> 02:14:11,640
I'm in.
I'm in.

2687
02:14:14,660 --> 02:14:18,570
And on that note,
where do we go from here?

2688
02:14:18,630 --> 02:14:19,463
Oh geez.
So many options under the desk into a 

2689
02:14:23,611 --> 02:14:28,260
fetal position that mary kay letourneau 
the girl that,

2690
02:14:28,261 --> 02:14:30,810
uh,
she's still With that boy and they had a

2691
02:14:30,811 --> 02:14:31,644
fake divorce.
They had to get a divorce because he's 

2692
02:14:33,001 --> 02:14:35,160
going into the wheat business.
Really?

2693
02:14:36,850 --> 02:14:40,860
They only got divorced so that she 
wouldn't be like legally,

2694
02:14:40,940 --> 02:14:41,773
uh,
it wouldn't be like a legal issue with 

2695
02:14:43,231 --> 02:14:44,064
him selling weed with him and her.
He was protecting her so they got a 

2696
02:14:47,461 --> 02:14:48,450
divorce,
but they're still together.

2697
02:14:48,451 --> 02:14:49,284
unhappy.
Apparently story like that coming out 

2698
02:14:50,911 --> 02:14:53,370
like every week right now.
But like a young teacher,

2699
02:14:54,480 --> 02:14:55,313
a substitute teacher,
24 accused of sex in two counties with 

2700
02:14:59,191 --> 02:15:00,750
her 17 year old student.
Okay.

2701
02:15:00,860 --> 02:15:03,300
It's only seven years difference folks.
Okay.

2702
02:15:04,270 --> 02:15:05,103
You got to let that go.
My parents have a huge age gap between 

2703
02:15:08,611 --> 02:15:09,444
them.
Cute.

2704
02:15:09,580 --> 02:15:10,413
Yeah.
How many years had you want to get 

2705
02:15:11,550 --> 02:15:12,830
close?
50.

2706
02:15:13,550 --> 02:15:15,390
How old is ben's dad?
Seventy,

2707
02:15:16,230 --> 02:15:18,230
78.
Not playing by the rules.

2708
02:15:18,240 --> 02:15:21,250
First of all,
I want you to go.

2709
02:15:21,320 --> 02:15:22,153
You have to.

2710
02:15:24,360 --> 02:15:28,260
Okay.
Look,

2711
02:15:28,261 --> 02:15:29,250
I've been playing this game my whole 
life.

2712
02:15:32,790 --> 02:15:35,940
so three things.
I can tell you.

2713
02:15:35,941 --> 02:15:36,780
Three things.
One,

2714
02:15:36,870 --> 02:15:37,920
okay.
I'm 31 years old.

2715
02:15:37,921 --> 02:15:41,640
I'm about to turn 32.
Second thing is my dad is crazy,

2716
02:15:41,641 --> 02:15:42,930
fucking old.
Crazy.

2717
02:15:42,931 --> 02:15:46,560
And the third thing is one person in my 
entire life has ever guessed old enough.

2718
02:15:47,010 --> 02:15:48,990
I mean you can go crazy.
Huge booty.

2719
02:15:49,010 --> 02:15:54,010
Okay already so hard to get a free pass.
They're the oldest guy ever.

2720
02:15:55,550 --> 02:15:58,140
Okay.
I think your dad is 95 years old.

2721
02:15:58,670 --> 02:16:02,460
You're actually spot on really turning 
96 in november.

2722
02:16:05,790 --> 02:16:06,623
That disturbs me.
I hate want to just take a shot in the 

2723
02:16:09,781 --> 02:16:10,614
dark.
But obviously you gave me a lot of 

2724
02:16:12,571 --> 02:16:16,470
parameters to work in.
Generally crazy old.

2725
02:16:16,680 --> 02:16:17,513
If it was your first guest,
people on the parameters never guessed 

2726
02:16:20,091 --> 02:16:21,020
that.
Never.

2727
02:16:21,780 --> 02:16:22,920
I love that.
Joe.

2728
02:16:22,921 --> 02:16:26,340
Just guests.
Your dad's proper age and he'll be 96 in

2729
02:16:26,341 --> 02:16:27,174
november.

2730
02:16:28,480 --> 02:16:29,260
Yeah.
Dude,

2731
02:16:29,260 --> 02:16:31,250
what are you.
What the fuck is going on?

2732
02:16:31,610 --> 02:16:32,443
Who may just as I was just a lucky guess
if I guessed when you didn't tell me he 

2733
02:16:35,501 --> 02:16:37,600
was crazy.
Old data would be impressive.

2734
02:16:38,210 --> 02:16:41,440
Feel like you give people,
but you hear what I'm saying?

2735
02:16:41,441 --> 02:16:42,850
Nobody has ever done it.
Yeah.

2736
02:16:42,851 --> 02:16:43,840
Yeah.
But that doesn't matter.

2737
02:16:43,841 --> 02:16:46,090
But you just said like,
I got lucky.

2738
02:16:46,091 --> 02:16:47,680
Listen,
but if you,

2739
02:16:47,740 --> 02:16:51,130
if you like,
this is why like psychics or problem.

2740
02:16:51,131 --> 02:16:54,280
they start leading you and then they 
give you a bunch of information,

2741
02:16:54,310 --> 02:16:56,560
you get a bunch of information first.
Then they take a guest,

2742
02:16:56,561 --> 02:16:57,394
like if I told you that I was a psychic 
and then we went through this whole 

2743
02:17:00,131 --> 02:17:01,930
thing.
I sense your dad is.

2744
02:17:02,620 --> 02:17:04,330
He's getting,
he's getting on,

2745
02:17:04,331 --> 02:17:06,230
but maybe not.
Maybe he is.

2746
02:17:06,231 --> 02:17:08,020
I mean maybe he's doing well.
You're right.

2747
02:17:08,021 --> 02:17:08,854
Your dad is.

2748
02:17:09,190 --> 02:17:10,880
My dad's really older.
He,

2749
02:17:10,910 --> 02:17:11,531
he's,
he's,

2750
02:17:11,531 --> 02:17:13,750
I feel like he's older.
Am I onto something you'd be like,

2751
02:17:13,751 --> 02:17:14,231
yes,
yes,

2752
02:17:14,231 --> 02:17:15,064
yes.
I feel like I feel like it's a big 

2753
02:17:16,901 --> 02:17:17,734
issue.
I feel like he's older than you would 

2754
02:17:19,040 --> 02:17:21,280
admit it.
It's definitely been a thing,

2755
02:17:21,281 --> 02:17:23,830
so I feel like he's,
I wanT to say is 95.

2756
02:17:23,831 --> 02:17:28,570
Oh my god.
That seems like psychic.

2757
02:17:28,600 --> 02:17:31,150
That's what psychics do.
ThoSe fucks pitches.

2758
02:17:31,180 --> 02:17:32,940
Like I had a friend of mine and he went 
to a psyche.

2759
02:17:32,941 --> 02:17:35,260
It's like dude's got a knew all aBout my
grandmother.

2760
02:17:35,261 --> 02:17:36,670
I'm like,
don't you know about grandma?

2761
02:17:37,300 --> 02:17:38,800
You know about your grandma.
RIght?

2762
02:17:38,950 --> 02:17:41,110
So this guy knew some shit that you 
already know.

2763
02:17:41,290 --> 02:17:43,480
Tell this guy to tell you some shit that
you don't know.

2764
02:17:43,910 --> 02:17:47,470
You want someone to tell you thIngs you 
already know that is fucking ridiculous.

2765
02:17:47,500 --> 02:17:49,280
You're going to set her off because 
she's going,

2766
02:17:49,780 --> 02:17:50,021
no,
no,

2767
02:17:50,021 --> 02:17:50,741
no,
not a bad way,

2768
02:17:50,741 --> 02:17:51,220
but.

2769
02:17:51,220 --> 02:17:54,040
And I've only,
I've never experienced it first hand.

2770
02:17:54,041 --> 02:17:58,330
I've never had a psychic or someone with
that kind of energy.

2771
02:17:58,331 --> 02:17:59,560
Tell me something that I was like,
wait,

2772
02:17:59,561 --> 02:18:01,300
what the fuck did you just like?
What?

2773
02:18:01,301 --> 02:18:04,480
There's people like you in my life who I
trust,

2774
02:18:04,720 --> 02:18:05,553
who have had experiences that are 
unexplainable psychics tell me a family 

2775
02:18:12,341 --> 02:18:13,174
secrets that I've bent over backwards to
try to understand how they could 

2776
02:18:15,881 --> 02:18:19,240
possibly know what they knew and I'm 
always skeptical.

2777
02:18:19,690 --> 02:18:20,523
That definitely had people that told me 
things that there's fucking no way they 

2778
02:18:23,771 --> 02:18:25,120
could know.
Here's the question though.

2779
02:18:25,180 --> 02:18:28,150
Did you give them any answers to other 
questions before that?

2780
02:18:28,900 --> 02:18:30,010
No.
None.

2781
02:18:30,011 --> 02:18:30,844
So they just told you right away your 
uncle's gay and he has a boy that he 

2782
02:18:33,941 --> 02:18:35,350
lives with.
He pretends to son,

2783
02:18:35,680 --> 02:18:36,730
but it's really those.
Joe,

2784
02:18:36,731 --> 02:18:38,740
what the fuck?
Are you serious?

2785
02:18:38,741 --> 02:18:40,610
Right?
without hesiTation,

2786
02:18:40,630 --> 02:18:42,880
yes,
without that.

2787
02:18:42,940 --> 02:18:43,773
But something that ridiculous,
outrageous that they could only guess 

2788
02:18:46,720 --> 02:18:47,553
and you didn't give him any answers to 
any leading questions before that I 

2789
02:18:51,061 --> 02:18:53,410
thought I heard on your podcast.
Maybe not,

2790
02:18:53,411 --> 02:18:58,411
but there is a documented history of the
military experimenting with.

2791
02:18:59,040 --> 02:19:02,320
So I mean if severe amending,
but for years and years and years,

2792
02:19:03,180 --> 02:19:06,360
money if there's no actual question,
no,

2793
02:19:06,370 --> 02:19:07,203
that's not necessarily true because they
wanted to find out if there was an 

2794
02:19:09,161 --> 02:19:11,170
answer and the only way you find out is 
if you have,

2795
02:19:11,200 --> 02:19:15,160
you have to run some tests and they had 
a thing called remote viewing.

2796
02:19:15,640 --> 02:19:18,310
And uh,
we actually had some real remote viewing

2797
02:19:18,311 --> 02:19:21,700
experts on that tv show that I did for 
awhile called the joe rogan questions.

2798
02:19:21,701 --> 02:19:22,534
Everything.
We sat down with them and I had all 

2799
02:19:24,401 --> 02:19:27,990
these,
these remote viewing guys low

2800
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:31,340
at the end of the dose.
It seems a lot like psychics.

2801
02:19:31,610 --> 02:19:33,620
It's like there's no,
like they,

2802
02:19:33,670 --> 02:19:38,670
they claim to have seen some things and 
pointed out some things that helped some

2803
02:19:39,291 --> 02:19:42,380
operations and this and that.
But it's all top secret.

2804
02:19:42,381 --> 02:19:44,390
Whether or not it's true,
you're never gonna know.

2805
02:19:44,760 --> 02:19:45,593
You're never goIng to know whether 
they're bullshitting you or something 

2806
02:19:47,241 --> 02:19:50,300
really did go down,
but I've never seen anybody do it.

2807
02:19:50,301 --> 02:19:51,134
We had two guys try to do it.
There were supposedly extra sentence 

2808
02:19:52,900 --> 02:19:53,733
they couldn't do shit

2809
02:19:54,870 --> 02:19:59,100
and I think there's a lot of people that
aren't authentic.

2810
02:19:59,670 --> 02:20:03,570
But that's true.
There's a lot of money in shenanigans.

2811
02:20:03,810 --> 02:20:04,643
There's a lot of money in palm reading 
that people that aren't going to charge 

2812
02:20:07,051 --> 02:20:07,884
you the money are probably the people 
that are actually doing something that 

2813
02:20:11,190 --> 02:20:11,610
is meeting

2814
02:20:11,610 --> 02:20:12,443
for maybe.
Or It might be like a Stephen King book 

2815
02:20:13,901 --> 02:20:14,734
were you driving down the street and see
that neon light and it says fortune 

2816
02:20:16,451 --> 02:20:17,284
teller and you'd go in and it's some 
lady who sees through your soul and she 

2817
02:20:19,481 --> 02:20:20,314
does and she really does know things and
it's just like this is how she gets by 

2818
02:20:23,471 --> 02:20:26,320
with this magic gift.
You just pay 20 bucks a pop and she just

2819
02:20:26,321 --> 02:20:28,660
tells you crazy shit and you do what you
do with that.

2820
02:20:28,870 --> 02:20:31,080
But she knows and no one ever believes.
She knows.

2821
02:20:31,081 --> 02:20:34,330
Cause it doesn't make any sense as 
fucking lady on ventura and victory like

2822
02:20:35,010 --> 02:20:37,000
fuck the more job.
How does she know?

2823
02:20:37,640 --> 02:20:40,570
She know all this,
but she does.

2824
02:20:40,660 --> 02:20:42,190
Ventura doesn't intersect with the 
victory.

2825
02:20:42,450 --> 02:20:45,180
Oh wow.
There's the catch.

2826
02:20:47,230 --> 02:20:50,160
So when you're in the police office 
telling them,

2827
02:20:50,170 --> 02:20:51,940
no,
I'm telling you the police was there.

2828
02:20:51,970 --> 02:20:54,160
It was real.
She was a real person.

2829
02:20:54,161 --> 02:20:54,994
I remembered the wilson's had been 
living on ventura and victory for 37 

2830
02:20:58,631 --> 02:21:01,350
years and they've never moved.
You get back to the house.

2831
02:21:01,360 --> 02:21:02,193
It's the house

2832
02:21:03,060 --> 02:21:04,110
where.
Where did,

2833
02:21:04,650 --> 02:21:05,483
where did the.
Where did fortune teller or you make it 

2834
02:21:08,201 --> 02:21:10,710
fun.
But I know I want to believe you right?

2835
02:21:10,711 --> 02:21:12,480
Because we're going to talk about this 
at the barbecue.

2836
02:21:13,050 --> 02:21:13,883
My buddy.
So you really believe you believe in 

2837
02:21:16,381 --> 02:21:17,270
psychics.
I've,

2838
02:21:17,280 --> 02:21:18,113
I've had too many things that I can't 
explain that I am always going to 

2839
02:21:21,091 --> 02:21:22,820
question.
But I have you.

2840
02:21:22,850 --> 02:21:25,470
Has anybody ever told you something was 
going to happen then it happened?

2841
02:21:25,620 --> 02:21:28,410
I don't like that shit and I don't.
I don't subscribe to that.

2842
02:21:28,411 --> 02:21:29,244
So if you shut your mouth,
I don't subscribe to that because I 

2843
02:21:32,101 --> 02:21:34,050
don't want someone to tell me my future.
I don't,

2844
02:21:34,051 --> 02:21:35,880
I don't.
I think that's unfair and I think that's

2845
02:21:36,180 --> 02:21:37,013
disrespectful.
I Think that weird word to use the 

2846
02:21:39,361 --> 02:21:44,361
experiences I've had with these people 
were with people that have died that uh,

2847
02:21:45,550 --> 02:21:46,383
I,
I've communicated with whether through 

2848
02:21:50,791 --> 02:21:51,624
dreams or psychedelics and I had 
questions but I didn't ask them and I 

2849
02:21:55,261 --> 02:21:56,094
waited to see if they would tell me.
And it's just kind of that sort of 

2850
02:22:00,460 --> 02:22:01,000
setup.

2851
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:01,833
Here's the thIng,
it might be real and it might be that 

2852
02:22:04,930 --> 02:22:06,670
real.
What real is,

2853
02:22:06,700 --> 02:22:10,960
is so ridiculous that it's almost like 
you can't bottle it,

2854
02:22:10,961 --> 02:22:11,794
you can't measure it,
you can't put it on the scale and it 

2855
02:22:13,181 --> 02:22:16,090
only exists in these brief moments and 
it comes and it goes.

2856
02:22:16,091 --> 02:22:16,924
You'll never be able to prove it and it 
just comes and it goes and it makes you 

2857
02:22:18,971 --> 02:22:19,661
think like,
god,

2858
02:22:19,661 --> 02:22:20,494
I think I really believe that really,
really did happen and no one really 

2859
02:22:23,441 --> 02:22:24,820
knows and everybody just goes about 
their.

2860
02:22:25,560 --> 02:22:26,010
But it really

2861
02:22:26,010 --> 02:22:27,930
did.
he really did tap in.

2862
02:22:28,170 --> 02:22:30,060
He really did talk to someone who's not 
there anymore.

2863
02:22:31,040 --> 02:22:33,880
I think whether you did or didn't,
um,

2864
02:22:34,590 --> 02:22:35,423
is,
is up to your acceptance of the 

2865
02:22:39,571 --> 02:22:40,404
experience and whether it's your ego or 
something you can't explain and if it 

2866
02:22:44,071 --> 02:22:46,620
brings you comfort,
that's great for sure.

2867
02:22:46,621 --> 02:22:47,640
if it brings you comfort,
right?

2868
02:22:47,641 --> 02:22:49,710
I mean that's the same argument for 
religion.

2869
02:22:49,870 --> 02:22:51,690
YOu know,
when people say the religions bullshit,

2870
02:22:51,691 --> 02:22:52,524
you go mom,
but it's bullshit that makes people 

2871
02:22:54,361 --> 02:22:55,194
happy.
If it makes people happy then it's not 

2872
02:22:56,311 --> 02:22:57,144
bullshit.
It's bullshit that makes people happy 

2873
02:22:58,711 --> 02:23:01,140
and also controls people and does really
terrible things.

2874
02:23:01,170 --> 02:23:04,140
So it's also have to do all those 
things.

2875
02:23:04,141 --> 02:23:06,210
But really,
I mean there's a lot of,

2876
02:23:07,930 --> 02:23:12,930
it's very multifaceted subject sugar,
but sugar sugar kills a lot of people,

2877
02:23:13,621 --> 02:23:17,060
but it also tastes delicious.
If you could just mention it,

2878
02:23:17,070 --> 02:23:17,850
like gets people.

2879
02:23:17,850 --> 02:23:18,683
But you know what's funny,
like I found out recently that a 

2880
02:23:20,700 --> 02:23:21,533
scientology,
oh religion is I'm the one of the main 

2881
02:23:27,061 --> 02:23:32,040
backers for a narcotics anonymous.
They are look it up,

2882
02:23:32,670 --> 02:23:34,610
I believe.
Tell me I'm wrong and going wrong.

2883
02:23:34,680 --> 02:23:37,740
Well they definitely don't like 
psychiatric medicine and,

2884
02:23:37,750 --> 02:23:38,583
and so that's a really interesting 
window into manipulation and tRying to 

2885
02:23:42,361 --> 02:23:46,560
get people to subscribe to something and
here's the thing,

2886
02:23:46,680 --> 02:23:48,650
there's a lot of fucking shit out there 
and I,

2887
02:23:48,651 --> 02:23:50,490
I don't,
I don't know what's right,

2888
02:23:50,640 --> 02:23:51,473
I can just speak to my own experiences 
and things that I absolutely questioned 

2889
02:23:56,400 --> 02:23:59,630
with,
with so much thought and,

2890
02:23:59,690 --> 02:24:03,770
and continue to do so from things that 
have happened years ago and I just,

2891
02:24:04,060 --> 02:24:04,893
I,
I can't deny how I felt and what I've 

2892
02:24:06,991 --> 02:24:11,460
experienced and I want to keep living 
and understanding whatever it is,

2893
02:24:12,180 --> 02:24:13,440
uh,
if,

2894
02:24:13,530 --> 02:24:15,930
you know,
there's a reason why we're here or there

2895
02:24:15,931 --> 02:24:18,360
isn't and we're just here,
but I,

2896
02:24:18,870 --> 02:24:19,703
I,
I'm,

2897
02:24:20,120 --> 02:24:20,940
I'm not religious.

2898
02:24:20,940 --> 02:24:21,773
I feel a really.
I feel inTerested in religion and some 

2899
02:24:26,461 --> 02:24:27,294
of the things I've experienced over the 
years being raised catholic and you're 

2900
02:24:31,860 --> 02:24:33,570
kind of talking about a religious 
experience.

2901
02:24:33,600 --> 02:24:34,171
Sure,
sure.

2902
02:24:34,171 --> 02:24:35,004
I mean,
what do you think that everyone's going 

2903
02:24:37,141 --> 02:24:38,790
to think of specific?
It had this argument.

2904
02:24:38,791 --> 02:24:40,940
It doesn't need is did we are,
we are.

2905
02:24:40,950 --> 02:24:42,870
Because iT's not really a religion to 
me,

2906
02:24:42,871 --> 02:24:43,704
it's not like some organized religion.
I'm the spiritual energetic exchange of 

2907
02:24:50,671 --> 02:24:51,504
information because I guess I equate 
religion and this is where we can all 

2908
02:24:55,231 --> 02:24:58,230
talk about this and like I am,
so I don't know if I'm right,

2909
02:24:58,280 --> 02:25:02,130
I'm not like preaching,
but no one knows if you're wrong either,

2910
02:25:02,190 --> 02:25:03,023
but,
but religion to me is like the 

2911
02:25:04,471 --> 02:25:05,304
catholicism.
I was raised on that and that requires 

2912
02:25:08,120 --> 02:25:13,120
um,
guilt and wrongfulness and sin and money

2913
02:25:14,701 --> 02:25:18,060
because you go to church and you put 
your money in the basket every sunday.

2914
02:25:18,480 --> 02:25:20,820
And I,
I don't,

2915
02:25:21,590 --> 02:25:23,710
I've,
I've seen enough and I know enough about

2916
02:25:23,740 --> 02:25:26,470
pedophilia within the catholic church 
that's undeniable.

2917
02:25:26,471 --> 02:25:27,304
You can't fucking deny any.
I'm talking about organization and 

2918
02:25:30,290 --> 02:25:32,360
that's how I equate religion.
Sure.

2919
02:25:33,130 --> 02:25:38,130
But I think the different people,
not the exact same that narcan and on.

2920
02:25:39,640 --> 02:25:40,473
Okay.
Synonymous is so narcan is what the 

2921
02:25:43,221 --> 02:25:44,054
scientology be people.
It's an organization that promises 

2922
02:25:47,240 --> 02:25:49,520
promotes rather than theories of 
scientology.

2923
02:25:49,521 --> 02:25:52,520
Founder l ron hubbard regarding 
substance abuse.

2924
02:25:53,330 --> 02:25:56,190
Same thing as narcotics or similar 
groups.

2925
02:25:56,470 --> 02:25:58,550
I appreciate that in his,
you know,

2926
02:25:58,551 --> 02:25:59,384
all of l ron hubbard stuff,
a lot of it came from other psychology 

2927
02:26:03,670 --> 02:26:08,300
textures and lectures rather than texts 
and books and stuff.

2928
02:26:08,530 --> 02:26:12,160
If you read the rudimentary levels of of
l ron hubbard's teachings,

2929
02:26:12,190 --> 02:26:13,023
they're like amazing and then they start
getting weirder and weirder and you're 

2930
02:26:16,291 --> 02:26:17,051
like,
wait a minute,

2931
02:26:17,051 --> 02:26:17,980
wait a minute,
wait a minute.

2932
02:26:18,400 --> 02:26:21,820
It's really interesting and I think 
that's even.

2933
02:26:21,821 --> 02:26:23,950
He didn't believe in psychics.
I know.

2934
02:26:25,470 --> 02:26:26,303
What are you saying?
I don't really believe in psychics 

2935
02:26:29,711 --> 02:26:31,600
either.
I just believe in my experiences.

2936
02:26:31,601 --> 02:26:33,730
I think that there's a.
There's a difference.

2937
02:26:33,731 --> 02:26:34,564
I think there's a lot of.
I think you should question everything 

2938
02:26:37,661 --> 02:26:40,600
and then try to understand yourself the 
best that you can.

2939
02:26:40,790 --> 02:26:42,830
I think that unique moments can be 
unique.

2940
02:26:43,040 --> 02:26:46,250
I think there's this things have 
happened When you think about someone on

2941
02:26:46,251 --> 02:26:48,590
the phone rings and they can tell you 
all day long.

2942
02:26:48,620 --> 02:26:50,300
That's a coincidence,
man.

2943
02:26:50,301 --> 02:26:53,120
How often do you think about them and 
the phone doesn't ring.

2944
02:26:53,480 --> 02:26:55,040
The might be,
you might be right,

2945
02:26:55,070 --> 02:26:57,920
you might be right,
but there are some pretty unique moments

2946
02:26:57,921 --> 02:27:00,680
that I'm not exactly convinced our 
measurable.

2947
02:27:00,740 --> 02:27:02,660
I don't know if they're measurable.
Right.

2948
02:27:02,690 --> 02:27:04,670
I think those unique moments where you 
think about someone,

2949
02:27:04,671 --> 02:27:06,140
they text you.
I don't.

2950
02:27:06,230 --> 02:27:09,890
I don't necessarily think that there's 
been adequate studies doing done on that

2951
02:27:09,891 --> 02:27:10,724
and I think there's a lot of people that
have these contrarion ideologies that 

2952
02:27:13,581 --> 02:27:18,110
they really love to dismiss things like 
this and they really love to dismiss the

2953
02:27:18,111 --> 02:27:20,450
potential connections that people have 
between each other,

2954
02:27:20,690 --> 02:27:23,180
but we know we have connections when 
we're near each other.

2955
02:27:23,480 --> 02:27:24,313
We know that like some people can just 
look at you and you look at them and 

2956
02:27:26,840 --> 02:27:27,673
let's get the fuck out of here.
We have like people have weird 

2957
02:27:31,251 --> 02:27:32,084
connections with the other.
You also know when someone's upset at 

2958
02:27:33,621 --> 02:27:35,210
you and they're not being honest about 
it.

2959
02:27:35,211 --> 02:27:36,470
You know,
like there's weird.

2960
02:27:36,500 --> 02:27:37,333
We have weird sort of ways of feeling 
each other out that don't necessarily 

2961
02:27:41,121 --> 02:27:44,030
fit on a scale but not quantifiable,
but they're,

2962
02:27:44,200 --> 02:27:45,033
they're,
they're.

2963
02:27:45,410 --> 02:27:46,880
You can't measure them,
but you feel them.

2964
02:27:47,220 --> 02:27:48,053
That's funny.
I was reading this article about that 

2965
02:27:49,690 --> 02:27:52,530
kind of ties into music too,
that just talking about,

2966
02:27:53,200 --> 02:27:53,930
you know,
the,

2967
02:27:53,930 --> 02:27:57,870
so you're talking about our ability to 
read each other's facial expressions,

2968
02:27:57,871 --> 02:28:00,660
emotional expressions,
and that's a successful trade,

2969
02:28:00,920 --> 02:28:01,753
you know,
that's something that's part of the 

2970
02:28:02,580 --> 02:28:03,710
development stuff,
right?

2971
02:28:04,080 --> 02:28:05,910
Um,
and basically this,

2972
02:28:05,911 --> 02:28:06,744
I'm just getting into it,
but this article is just talking about 

2973
02:28:08,131 --> 02:28:08,964
how those,
it's just a lot of scientists trying to 

2974
02:28:11,251 --> 02:28:13,980
understand are people like why the fuck 
is music important?

2975
02:28:13,981 --> 02:28:16,440
Like this doesn't know,
why is this such an obsession?

2976
02:28:16,510 --> 02:28:21,510
Human obsession just is a drug to that.
I mean it certainly is like even like

2977
02:28:22,040 --> 02:28:22,873
the other day I was watching rocky four,
rocky ford came on just out of nowhere 

2978
02:28:25,281 --> 02:28:29,090
else flipping to and songs that I don't 
even think are good anymore,

2979
02:28:29,540 --> 02:28:30,373
you know,
but I recognize the drug like effect 

2980
02:28:32,300 --> 02:28:36,920
that like one of those rocky songs will 
survive a rocky songs.

2981
02:28:37,310 --> 02:28:39,770
But it's a combination of the movie and 
the music.

2982
02:28:39,771 --> 02:28:41,270
Yes.
It's not just the music,

2983
02:28:41,380 --> 02:28:43,490
there's the visual,
but sometimes not.

2984
02:28:43,700 --> 02:28:45,890
Sometimes just the music.
You know,

2985
02:28:45,891 --> 02:28:50,891
like when I run,
when I run and if I listen to music,

2986
02:28:51,201 --> 02:28:55,780
I can go longer for sure.
Was that what the fuck's goIng on there?

2987
02:28:56,080 --> 02:28:59,330
How come you're not as tired when you're
listening to an emotional response?

2988
02:29:00,050 --> 02:29:03,160
You're inspired.
You're inspired by something that was,

2989
02:29:03,920 --> 02:29:04,753
that was taught to you at a,
at a different time than the rhythm of 

2990
02:29:09,021 --> 02:29:12,140
the music was,
was ingrained in you.

2991
02:29:12,141 --> 02:29:14,690
At some point I can listen to motley 
crue,

2992
02:29:14,790 --> 02:29:17,150
kickstart my heart and I can get up any 
fucking hell.

2993
02:29:17,180 --> 02:29:19,490
I would imagine if you take an 
indigenous tribe in,

2994
02:29:19,491 --> 02:29:21,230
played like rock music,
they'd be like,

2995
02:29:21,231 --> 02:29:23,990
what the fuck?
They had no idea what it was,

2996
02:29:24,380 --> 02:29:28,660
but maybe they wouldn't because there's,
there's rhythm and there's a lot of um,

2997
02:29:28,850 --> 02:29:29,683
there's a lot of musical,
a tribal contributions to that area of 

2998
02:29:35,331 --> 02:29:39,710
your life as a dancer.

2999
02:29:43,310 --> 02:29:46,760
Exactly.
We're not off the rails.

3000
02:29:46,761 --> 02:29:47,570
Right?
We're good.

3001
02:29:47,570 --> 02:29:52,570
We're so good at.
That's what you're saying.

3002
02:29:53,080 --> 02:29:56,090
I feel like this is our best one yet.
Maybe we've said that before.

3003
02:29:56,760 --> 02:29:59,720
I don't know.
I haven't done one in awhile.

3004
02:29:59,760 --> 02:30:02,480
It was over two years.
Two years.

3005
02:30:02,900 --> 02:30:04,700
Oh well shit,
shit.

3006
02:30:04,701 --> 02:30:05,534
Damn,
you guys are still the only band I've 

3007
02:30:06,351 --> 02:30:07,940
ever worked with.
Come on.

3008
02:30:08,360 --> 02:30:12,470
Never worked with a band before.
Never did shows.

3009
02:30:12,500 --> 02:30:14,100
We did a couple shows.
Those are fun.

3010
02:30:14,160 --> 02:30:16,130
Such a blast.
They were so much fun.

3011
02:30:16,190 --> 02:30:19,080
Oh my gosh.
We had a new year's together.

3012
02:30:19,620 --> 02:30:21,550
You are so great.
You.

3013
02:30:21,670 --> 02:30:24,710
You were like,
people were trying to count down and you

3014
02:30:24,711 --> 02:30:26,420
weren't done with your bit and you were 
like,

3015
02:30:26,570 --> 02:30:27,800
fuck you.
I'm not done.

3016
02:30:28,070 --> 02:30:29,540
And then you said,
okay,

3017
02:30:29,600 --> 02:30:32,450
now we can celebrate the new year.
It was amazing.

3018
02:30:32,570 --> 02:30:35,030
It was so great.
Was in the middle of a bit.

3019
02:30:35,030 --> 02:30:36,570
People are booked.
Darn.

3020
02:30:38,560 --> 02:30:40,900
I missed it by 10 seconds folks.
Hang in there.

3021
02:30:41,580 --> 02:30:42,413
Hang in there.
Well we did the end of the world pod or 

3022
02:30:44,900 --> 02:30:48,290
twice whether to new year's December 
21st,

3023
02:30:48,290 --> 02:30:50,270
2012 was the big one.
That was the first one we did.

3024
02:30:50,300 --> 02:30:51,133
We did the end of the world one.
Which stan hope and joy and new year's 

3025
02:30:53,361 --> 02:30:54,360
though.
It wasn't new years.

3026
02:30:54,720 --> 02:30:55,560
December 20.
First.

3027
02:30:55,720 --> 02:31:00,720
It was the end of the calendar.
We planned that one out in advance.

3028
02:31:01,880 --> 02:31:03,810
Yeah,
we knew we were going to do stand up and

3029
02:31:03,811 --> 02:31:04,644
I talked about doing that like because 
he got tired of me talking about the 

3030
02:31:07,281 --> 02:31:08,114
mayan calendar.
Let's fucking promise we're going to do 

3031
02:31:11,361 --> 02:31:13,700
a show December 21st week.
Let's do it.

3032
02:31:13,701 --> 02:31:17,570
Let's get deals on board and you know I 
met you guys went to clinton because I'm

3033
02:31:17,580 --> 02:31:20,630
a fucking crazy end of the world from 
December 24th

3034
02:31:20,630 --> 02:31:22,950
and then the life went on for five more 
years.

3035
02:31:22,951 --> 02:31:24,780
Like everything was going.
Hey,

3036
02:31:24,781 --> 02:31:26,940
thanks for bringing us on.
that was a lot of fun.

3037
02:31:26,970 --> 02:31:28,830
it was fun for us too.
It's fun.

3038
02:31:28,920 --> 02:31:31,950
How did you get.
So how did you get the Alex Jones one to

3039
02:31:31,951 --> 02:31:33,630
be nine slash 11.
Nine slash 11.

3040
02:31:33,660 --> 02:31:37,920
I had to plan it out.
Do I had to fit some podcast in?

3041
02:31:37,921 --> 02:31:38,754
I had to do like extra ones the week 
before just so I could get to number 

3042
02:31:41,461 --> 02:31:42,850
nine slash 11 with alex.
Right,

3043
02:31:42,990 --> 02:31:43,823
wasn't it?
That sounds like a long seat of had him 

3044
02:31:46,460 --> 02:31:49,410
on earlier and I would've definitely had
them on again for nine slash 11.

3045
02:31:49,411 --> 02:31:51,510
But having them on the first time for 
nine slash 11,

3046
02:31:51,630 --> 02:31:55,620
and to this day,
that's our biggest podcast by far,

3047
02:31:56,060 --> 02:31:59,610
by maybe $5 million downloads.
Fuck yeah.

3048
02:31:59,611 --> 02:32:00,890
But here's the conspiracy,
right?

3049
02:32:00,930 --> 02:32:02,340
Is that right?
Am I saying correctly?

3050
02:32:02,370 --> 02:32:03,480
What is the actual number?

3051
02:32:05,640 --> 02:32:06,473
16 now?
I didn't check in the last two to three 

3052
02:32:07,531 --> 02:32:08,500
days,
but okay,

3053
02:32:08,520 --> 02:32:10,950
so $16,000,000.
Here's what's crazy.

3054
02:32:11,610 --> 02:32:12,443
It never charted on itunes.
The itunes charts magically went down 

3055
02:32:16,590 --> 02:32:17,423
while the Alex Jones podcast was in 
acute and they stayed down for over a 

3056
02:32:20,730 --> 02:32:23,490
week conspiracy theory and then when it 
came back up,

3057
02:32:23,910 --> 02:32:27,270
podcasts that got way less downloads 
than alex's,

3058
02:32:27,300 --> 02:32:29,580
we're re were rated much higher than 
his.

3059
02:32:30,330 --> 02:32:31,163
And theY had happened before and after 
his was the only podcast that was left 

3060
02:32:36,091 --> 02:32:36,924
out of the ratings loop,
like for sure it would have been the 

3061
02:32:39,031 --> 02:32:39,864
number one podcast in the country.
It was the number one podcast we did by 

3062
02:32:41,761 --> 02:32:44,220
a mile and I've had the number one 
podcast before.

3063
02:32:44,570 --> 02:32:45,403
so the number one podcast episode that 
was more than 5 million downloads more 

3064
02:32:49,441 --> 02:32:51,240
than any other podcasts I had before.
Crazy.

3065
02:32:51,440 --> 02:32:52,273
So it's should for sure,
probably would have been number one if 

3066
02:32:53,671 --> 02:32:56,310
it wasn't a lot of downloads,
unless they had like one of those serial

3067
02:32:56,311 --> 02:32:58,080
episodes or something that came out that
week.

3068
02:32:59,760 --> 02:33:02,080
So there you go.
And that's it.

3069
02:33:02,100 --> 02:33:04,840
It's very likely that someone's trying 
to hold Alex Jones back.

3070
02:33:05,340 --> 02:33:07,970
Stokes his fucking.
They don't understand this,

3071
02:33:07,971 --> 02:33:12,360
the streisand effect.
And stoke the fire of Alex Jones.

3072
02:33:12,361 --> 02:33:13,470
Even megan kelly's.
Fuck.

3073
02:33:13,471 --> 02:33:16,920
Now her show's going down the toilet.
What happened in the aftermath?

3074
02:33:17,280 --> 02:33:18,330
She.
Here's the.

3075
02:33:18,360 --> 02:33:19,970
Here's the problem.
Here's the problem.

3076
02:33:20,010 --> 02:33:25,010
Megan kelly was a fox news person.
She left fox news to go to nbc.

3077
02:33:25,200 --> 02:33:26,033
Nbc is thought of as cnbc,
which is thought of as fake news by 

3078
02:33:30,361 --> 02:33:33,810
these right wing trump.
Trump bands.

3079
02:33:33,870 --> 02:33:36,240
What would you call them?
Trump trumpers.

3080
02:33:36,420 --> 02:33:39,390
So as soon as she goes over there,
they're not going to listen to her.

3081
02:33:39,660 --> 02:33:43,650
And then to the liberals,
she's fox news so they're not interested

3082
02:33:43,651 --> 02:33:46,440
in either.
and then she does this podcast with Alex

3083
02:33:46,440 --> 02:33:49,230
Jones or this interview rather with Alex
Jones and the interview with Alex Jones.

3084
02:33:49,530 --> 02:33:50,363
She says,
I'm not going to paint you out as a 

3085
02:33:52,411 --> 02:33:54,140
monster.
I'm going to give you a fee,

3086
02:33:54,180 --> 02:33:56,730
like she's saying all these things.
She's going to throw softballs this way.

3087
02:33:56,731 --> 02:34:00,360
I want people to get to know you,
and he releases all that and he's like,

3088
02:34:00,361 --> 02:34:01,320
hey,
this is that person,

3089
02:34:01,321 --> 02:34:05,030
and then the ratings just keep you 
gotta.

3090
02:34:05,250 --> 02:34:09,090
If you want to be an ice princess,
you gotta gotta go fox news full life.

3091
02:34:09,091 --> 02:34:10,530
You want.
You want to sell guns,

3092
02:34:10,770 --> 02:34:12,930
you want to be a second amendment 
proponent.

3093
02:34:12,940 --> 02:34:16,890
Which fucking cold,
blue steel eyes and smooth,

3094
02:34:16,900 --> 02:34:17,980
shiny legs and

3095
02:34:18,040 --> 02:34:21,280
nice shoes and tiny skirts.
You got to be on fox news.

3096
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:25,750
How do you get smith's?
Got to shAve them down constantly.

3097
02:34:25,751 --> 02:34:26,750
All day long.
Yeah.

3098
02:34:26,800 --> 02:34:29,380
You have oil them up to.
Yeah,

3099
02:34:29,390 --> 02:34:30,223
you have illegal immigrants.
It's just kind of a natural thing for 

3100
02:34:33,131 --> 02:34:33,521
me.
Oh,

3101
02:34:33,521 --> 02:34:35,810
really?
You're hairless in the legs and somebody

3102
02:34:35,900 --> 02:34:37,920
has got to be like that,
right?

3103
02:34:38,080 --> 02:34:40,000
I got to be somebody out there with no 
leg hair.

3104
02:34:41,230 --> 02:34:43,380
I'm sure it happens.
It's called purity.

3105
02:34:44,450 --> 02:34:45,670
Sure.
What it's called.

3106
02:34:46,720 --> 02:34:47,553
Sure has been brought it up one day.
We're all going to have no hair and 

3107
02:34:50,940 --> 02:34:52,650
they're gonna.
Look back at pictures of us going to go,

3108
02:34:52,660 --> 02:34:54,700
what the fuck were they doing?
What is that?

3109
02:34:54,950 --> 02:34:57,340
The human race,
facial hair and shit.

3110
02:34:57,610 --> 02:35:02,610
Everyone to know why brows and lashes.
I really think that's the future.

3111
02:35:02,710 --> 02:35:04,960
I think the future is those aliens for 
close encounters.

3112
02:35:04,960 --> 02:35:05,793
I think the reason why we have those 
archetypal images in our head that says 

3113
02:35:08,321 --> 02:35:12,580
we know that's what we're going to talk 
to paul hellyer or looked at his stuff.

3114
02:35:13,240 --> 02:35:15,820
He's like the canadian alien,
david.

3115
02:35:16,400 --> 02:35:19,170
They're all the same,
but he was.

3116
02:35:19,180 --> 02:35:23,320
He was part of the government.
The government will have him for sure.

3117
02:35:23,321 --> 02:35:24,154
He's telling the truth.
He specifically talks about the 

3118
02:35:26,440 --> 02:35:28,070
different types of aliens.
Oh,

3119
02:35:28,071 --> 02:35:30,450
well that makes them even more legit for
sure.

3120
02:35:30,460 --> 02:35:31,293
With no evidence.
He definitely would tell us all about 

3121
02:35:33,041 --> 02:35:33,874
these.
All different brands you might want to 

3122
02:35:35,441 --> 02:35:36,550
have them on.
I have,

3123
02:35:36,551 --> 02:35:38,610
unfortunately.
I'm not saying there's no events.

3124
02:35:39,400 --> 02:35:42,420
I don't know him,
but I know the whole alien alien.

3125
02:35:42,970 --> 02:35:45,280
You don't want people to know.
I think there's a business.

3126
02:35:45,980 --> 02:35:46,813
Values are who you are.
Problem is there's a business and 

3127
02:35:49,931 --> 02:35:50,764
telling people the candidates,
aliens would give us some more tech if 

3128
02:35:55,091 --> 02:35:55,900
we'd stop wars.

3129
02:35:55,900 --> 02:35:56,800
All right,
let's play this.

3130
02:35:56,980 --> 02:35:58,810
I want to hear this.
What's that?

3131
02:35:59,530 --> 02:35:59,951
Oh,
it's not,

3132
02:35:59,951 --> 02:36:01,730
but it's on our team,
but why is he the one?

3133
02:36:02,220 --> 02:36:06,050
He was on our t this.
Why don't you talk to her,

3134
02:36:06,060 --> 02:36:08,930
but it says on our t proof of aliens.
Presidents overwhelmed.

3135
02:36:10,200 --> 02:36:14,020
That's just a picture of it.
That's just a screenshot was on.

3136
02:36:14,021 --> 02:36:15,180
right?
So he's got to be.

3137
02:36:15,200 --> 02:36:16,270
It's got to be a video of it.
No,

3138
02:36:16,720 --> 02:36:17,553
there's many videos of paul hellyer.
Do you buy it when you listen to them 

3139
02:36:20,801 --> 02:36:23,110
talk?
It makes me question to hear.

3140
02:36:23,111 --> 02:36:23,944
I'm interested.
I'd like to hear his voice to see if my 

3141
02:36:25,391 --> 02:36:30,391
crazy radar goes off.
Just give me a little on what you feel.

3142
02:36:33,060 --> 02:36:34,390
You got two different shit.
Plan.

3143
02:36:34,420 --> 02:36:35,410
Jamie's a tabber.

3144
02:36:36,880 --> 02:36:38,260
Well,
because I know that they are.

3145
02:36:39,730 --> 02:36:40,563
As a matter of fact,
they've been visiting our planet for 

3146
02:36:44,410 --> 02:36:45,243
thousands of years and one of the cases 
that would interest you most if they're 

3147
02:36:49,190 --> 02:36:53,230
getting two or three minutes to answer 
is during the cold war.

3148
02:36:53,270 --> 02:36:54,103
Nineteen 61 there were about 50 ufo 
information flying south from Russia to 

3149
02:37:00,730 --> 02:37:05,730
the across europe and the supreme allied
commander was very concerned,

3150
02:37:07,190 --> 02:37:08,023
um,
and about ready to press the panic 

3151
02:37:09,911 --> 02:37:12,670
button when they turned around and went 
back over the north pole.

3152
02:37:13,240 --> 02:37:14,073
So they decided to do an investigation 
and the investigators for three years 

3153
02:37:19,610 --> 02:37:24,610
and they decided that with absolute 
certainty that for species for different

3154
02:37:26,181 --> 02:37:27,014
species,
at least I've been visiting this planet 

3155
02:37:30,291 --> 02:37:33,570
for thousands of years.
So that's a,

3156
02:37:33,620 --> 02:37:34,453
we have a long history of ufo is.
And of course there's been a lot more 

3157
02:37:37,341 --> 02:37:38,174
activity on the last few decades since 
we invented the atomic bomb and they're 

3158
02:37:45,320 --> 02:37:46,720
very concerned about,
uh,

3159
02:37:46,721 --> 02:37:48,540
about that and the fact that,
uh,

3160
02:37:49,090 --> 02:37:49,923
we might use it again and because the 
whole cosmos is a unity and it affects 

3161
02:37:54,711 --> 02:37:57,290
not just us,
but other people in the cosmos,

3162
02:37:57,680 --> 02:37:58,513
there are very much afraid that we might
be stupid enough to start using atomic 

3163
02:38:02,751 --> 02:38:03,530
weapons again.

3164
02:38:03,530 --> 02:38:06,410
And this would be very bad for us and 
for them as well.

3165
02:38:06,740 --> 02:38:07,573
So no serious scientists has ever 
publicly confirmed evidence of an 

3166
02:38:10,971 --> 02:38:11,804
encounter with extraterrestrials.
Why would scientists not confirm the 

3167
02:38:15,141 --> 02:38:16,640
facts if they exist?

3168
02:38:17,300 --> 02:38:18,133
I'm afraid they must go out of their way
to not to find out because if they 

3169
02:38:21,751 --> 02:38:22,760
didn't,
you know,

3170
02:38:22,800 --> 02:38:23,633
even 10 percent of the amount of 
research I've done in the last eight 

3171
02:38:25,801 --> 02:38:28,380
years,
they would be as convinced as I am.

3172
02:38:28,830 --> 02:38:30,570
I mean,
they could do it even faster,

3173
02:38:30,890 --> 02:38:33,330
um,
by taking them a little longer when they

3174
02:38:33,331 --> 02:38:35,850
didn't have a military background.
But,

3175
02:38:35,851 --> 02:38:36,684
uh,
there are so many wonderful books that 

3176
02:38:38,630 --> 02:38:43,110
tell these stories and uh,
and they've been authenticated.

3177
02:38:43,150 --> 02:38:48,030
The sightings have been authenticated by
more than one witness and also by.

3178
02:38:48,031 --> 02:38:48,450
Right?

3179
02:38:48,450 --> 02:38:49,283
Okay.
This is the same horseshit debit 

3180
02:38:50,941 --> 02:38:52,670
authenticated by witnesses.
There's,

3181
02:38:52,680 --> 02:38:54,750
that doesn't mean anything.
There's no real video.

3182
02:38:54,751 --> 02:38:57,000
There's no real photographs.
Nothing looks good.

3183
02:38:57,510 --> 02:38:58,343
A lot of people were talking about it.
But when you think about how many human 

3184
02:39:00,781 --> 02:39:04,890
beings there are,
there's 320 million plus in America.

3185
02:39:05,100 --> 02:39:07,530
How many of them are crazy?
At least one percent.

3186
02:39:07,531 --> 02:39:09,090
That's 3 million,
200,000

3187
02:39:09,091 --> 02:39:12,510
crazy people.
How many of them are really believe what

3188
02:39:12,511 --> 02:39:14,130
they're saying?
At least half.

3189
02:39:14,400 --> 02:39:18,630
So you got 100.
You got a lot of fucking crazy people.

3190
02:39:18,690 --> 02:39:21,870
Well this is one video,
so I've watched a couple of his and it's

3191
02:39:21,871 --> 02:39:23,820
just,
it's interesting to think about in terms

3192
02:39:23,821 --> 02:39:26,610
of like we're here.
It's interesting to think about,

3193
02:39:26,611 --> 02:39:28,320
but as soon as someone starts talking 
like that,

3194
02:39:28,620 --> 02:39:31,500
he says they've been authenticated.
There was more than one witness.

3195
02:39:31,680 --> 02:39:33,810
That means nothing.
People are full of shit.

3196
02:39:33,811 --> 02:39:34,644
you just.
I saw something doesn't mean anything 

3197
02:39:35,881 --> 02:39:36,714
you might've you might not have,
but if he's 100 percent all in and he 

3198
02:39:39,391 --> 02:39:42,060
hasn't had a ufo experience himself that
he's talking about,

3199
02:39:42,790 --> 02:39:46,500
then he seems gullible.
I talked to a lot of those people.

3200
02:39:46,800 --> 02:39:47,633
I talked to those people that had been.
I talked to people that have had 

3201
02:39:49,470 --> 02:39:53,160
implants pulled out of their body.
I talked to people that were experts.

3202
02:39:53,750 --> 02:39:54,583
Oh,
it's gone.

3203
02:39:54,780 --> 02:39:55,680
What does it say?
You've seen one?

3204
02:39:55,980 --> 02:39:56,813
Yeah,
well it's something that gives me a 

3205
02:40:00,860 --> 02:40:03,270
light.
Mine haven't seen one,

3206
02:40:03,271 --> 02:40:04,104
but I'm curious to know.
But what he just said there did not 

3207
02:40:06,091 --> 02:40:06,924
impress me because he said that multiple
people had seen it like more than one 

3208
02:40:10,471 --> 02:40:14,010
person had confirmed it.
That doesn't mean like

3209
02:40:14,010 --> 02:40:14,843
you could have five guys that ally.
That doesn't mean they might tell the 

3210
02:40:16,831 --> 02:40:17,730
truth.
I don't think so.

3211
02:40:17,880 --> 02:40:21,890
italians call my people.
Do the ooh folks.

3212
02:40:22,380 --> 02:40:23,640
Yeah,
I've never heard that.

3213
02:40:23,930 --> 02:40:25,050
Is it two?
Oh,

3214
02:40:26,070 --> 02:40:31,070
two in a row do Harry Potter was a fail,
but I came back around.

3215
02:40:32,820 --> 02:40:37,820
It wasn't 100 percent.
It's not to dismiss,

3216
02:40:40,580 --> 02:40:41,413
dismiss the possibility of ufo.
It's just that you gotta really be 

3217
02:40:43,801 --> 02:40:45,720
careful with how people talk about 
stuff.

3218
02:40:46,790 --> 02:40:48,450
You got to be,
you know,

3219
02:40:48,451 --> 02:40:51,400
if someone starts talking that they know
something and that's.

3220
02:40:51,700 --> 02:40:52,533
That's one video.
I've Watched a few of his videos and 

3221
02:40:54,421 --> 02:40:56,040
they were really interesting.
He was,

3222
02:40:56,041 --> 02:41:00,440
he was speaking with for canadian 
congress talking about this and I,

3223
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:04,850
I've watched a lot of it in its entirety
and it's just worth thinking about.

3224
02:41:04,860 --> 02:41:06,390
That's all.
I don't know what the truth is.

3225
02:41:06,391 --> 02:41:07,760
I think.
yeah,

3226
02:41:08,130 --> 02:41:08,761
sure,
please.

3227
02:41:08,761 --> 02:41:09,300
Yeah,
always.

3228
02:41:09,300 --> 02:41:11,100
Just the fact that he has a lot of 
videos out there,

3229
02:41:11,101 --> 02:41:11,934
it makes me wonder because that means 
that he's making a living doing this or 

3230
02:41:14,851 --> 02:41:16,530
this is this,
this is a gig.

3231
02:41:16,710 --> 02:41:21,490
This is a thing he does your speaking 
before the canadian congress chorus,

3232
02:41:21,540 --> 02:41:22,373
if he does a bunch of these other 
interviews as well that allows them to 

3233
02:41:24,301 --> 02:41:25,590
speak in front of.
That's his thing.

3234
02:41:25,950 --> 02:41:28,050
His thing is I'm the guy who knows 
everything about ufo.

3235
02:41:28,130 --> 02:41:30,840
Right,
but if you were talking to scientists,

3236
02:41:31,200 --> 02:41:33,060
they would say,
show us the residence.

3237
02:41:33,150 --> 02:41:34,710
Right.
There's nothing.

3238
02:41:35,250 --> 02:41:38,250
That's the thing about these guys.
They all have stories and no one has any

3239
02:41:38,251 --> 02:41:42,000
evidence.
I mean feel evidence,

3240
02:41:42,001 --> 02:41:43,680
but it feels good to think that they're 
out there.

3241
02:41:43,681 --> 02:41:45,360
Right.
I want to know.

3242
02:41:45,361 --> 02:41:48,030
I want to know stuff.
I mean like look at all the shit that we

3243
02:41:48,031 --> 02:41:51,360
have and we're here and all the things 
that we have,

3244
02:41:51,710 --> 02:41:56,710
all the resources that we use and we're 
one planet in the universe full of other

3245
02:41:59,911 --> 02:42:00,744
plants.

3246
02:42:01,100 --> 02:42:03,000
That's all it is.
Way up there.

3247
02:42:03,360 --> 02:42:04,500
I'm not afraid to say that.
I'm.

3248
02:42:04,560 --> 02:42:05,920
I'm curious.
I'm curious.

3249
02:42:06,600 --> 02:42:10,230
I think people generally,
it feels like a normal thing to be like,

3250
02:42:10,231 --> 02:42:11,250
yeah,
they're fucking out there,

3251
02:42:11,520 --> 02:42:14,130
but what I think is hard to accept this 
evidence.

3252
02:42:14,180 --> 02:42:15,013
What's hard to accept is that they're 
communicating with us and only certain 

3253
02:42:17,731 --> 02:42:19,570
people like paul hellyer,
no,

3254
02:42:19,830 --> 02:42:22,350
maybe he does know and maybe he has seen
something,

3255
02:42:22,351 --> 02:42:23,184
but maybe he's full of shit.
The problem is if you haven't seen it 

3256
02:42:25,771 --> 02:42:26,604
and I haven't,
or at least I don't think I have and 

3257
02:42:28,600 --> 02:42:30,180
you're,
you're talking about these things,

3258
02:42:30,440 --> 02:42:31,273
how much,
how much time you spend thinking and 

3259
02:42:32,371 --> 02:42:33,204
talking about them.
Like it gets to become almost like a 

3260
02:42:35,221 --> 02:42:36,054
pathology,
like why are you so invested in 

3261
02:42:37,261 --> 02:42:38,670
something that you don't even know his 
real,

3262
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:40,890
but it becomes a thing that people were 
into,

3263
02:42:40,891 --> 02:42:43,950
like they're into baseball scores or the
random bowling.

3264
02:42:44,160 --> 02:42:46,860
They get into ufo,
they get into it and then they start.

3265
02:42:46,980 --> 02:42:49,230
I mean this dude's obviously making a 
career out of it.

3266
02:42:49,380 --> 02:42:52,140
He's out there traveling.
That's something to,

3267
02:42:52,200 --> 02:42:57,150
to investigate upon this conversation,
but it makes me think for years,

3268
02:42:57,151 --> 02:42:59,580
like I've seen some videos and I'm just 
like,

3269
02:42:59,581 --> 02:43:00,500
wow,
okay.

3270
02:43:00,850 --> 02:43:01,683
It makes me think that's all.
Maybe I will always be curious about 

3271
02:43:05,010 --> 02:43:05,843
that.
About aliens and psychics and all the 

3272
02:43:07,331 --> 02:43:08,164
shit.
It's so controversial way where it's 

3273
02:43:10,561 --> 02:43:12,460
like yes or no,
I just don't know,

3274
02:43:12,461 --> 02:43:15,190
but I want to know.
I'd love to keep learning I to,

3275
02:43:15,520 --> 02:43:16,353
but I think that with guys like this,
when you're talking about a subject 

3276
02:43:18,431 --> 02:43:22,390
that's this mercurial,
is this such a difficult subject?

3277
02:43:22,391 --> 02:43:25,000
I think it's very impOrtant to only talk
about the actual facts,

3278
02:43:25,250 --> 02:43:26,083
like what we know or what we Don't know.
If he wants to talk about his own 

3279
02:43:27,971 --> 02:43:30,010
personal experience,
that's one thing,

3280
02:43:30,011 --> 02:43:30,844
but when you start talking about stories
that you heard like people are full of 

3281
02:43:34,181 --> 02:43:35,014
shit from the beginning of time when 
telling stupid stories about werewolves 

3282
02:43:37,931 --> 02:43:40,690
and vampires and of damages done to.

3283
02:43:40,690 --> 02:43:44,320
It's like it's all derivative passed 
down like,

3284
02:43:44,321 --> 02:43:45,154
oh,
I heard this from this and this and 

3285
02:43:45,701 --> 02:43:47,180
this,
but you weren't there so you don't know.

3286
02:43:47,780 --> 02:43:52,780
It's like I'm reading this book about 
our brains and how our recollection of a

3287
02:43:53,141 --> 02:43:56,230
memory of memories and like eye 
witnesses are usually inaccurate,

3288
02:43:56,350 --> 02:43:57,183
inaccurate because you don't really 
remember like you think you did in your 

3289
02:43:59,951 --> 02:44:04,951
brain lies to you and tells you that you
saw something a certain way and,

3290
02:44:05,921 --> 02:44:07,910
and even that like,
I dunno,

3291
02:44:08,140 --> 02:44:08,973
it's very important for people are 
absolutely a lot of people out there 

3292
02:44:12,251 --> 02:44:15,190
that think their memories are super 
accurate and this ties into being wrong.

3293
02:44:15,400 --> 02:44:16,233
This ties into being like I didn't see 
it the way that I think I did and I 

3294
02:44:21,071 --> 02:44:23,300
might've made a mistake and I'm sorry.
You know,

3295
02:44:23,660 --> 02:44:24,493
that's okay.
That's important too because I think a 

3296
02:44:27,911 --> 02:44:28,744
lot of times when you have some big 
statement about something that you 

3297
02:44:30,821 --> 02:44:31,654
believe in or,
or like if you want to get down to 

3298
02:44:34,631 --> 02:44:38,860
having some sort of a trial of this or 
that and you say,

3299
02:44:38,861 --> 02:44:40,420
I remember it just like this.

3300
02:44:41,680 --> 02:44:42,513
It's dramatic and emotional sell it.
It's element like you're running for 

3301
02:44:46,961 --> 02:44:48,280
congress,
it's,

3302
02:44:48,640 --> 02:44:50,340
it's $40,000
day.

3303
02:44:50,770 --> 02:44:55,770
Frightening really is.
It is people that are trying to convince

3304
02:44:57,821 --> 02:44:58,654
people.
I mean that's one of the reasons why 

3305
02:44:59,261 --> 02:45:00,094
being a president so crazy because 
you're basically like trying to trick 

3306
02:45:02,111 --> 02:45:02,944
people into liking.
You try to be charismatic and that's 

3307
02:45:05,201 --> 02:45:07,030
what sells the most.
I made a mistake.

3308
02:45:07,090 --> 02:45:09,340
Do they ever say,
I'm sorry I messed up.

3309
02:45:09,490 --> 02:45:11,410
I'm sure.
So he wants to publicly.

3310
02:45:11,700 --> 02:45:13,870
I don't know.
I think there's those moments.

3311
02:45:13,871 --> 02:45:16,450
I think it's probably be really 
interesting.

3312
02:45:16,470 --> 02:45:18,760
I was going to happen to him.
Is going to have to happen some day.

3313
02:45:20,070 --> 02:45:23,860
So seeing your child.
I don'T know which one that is.

3314
02:45:24,460 --> 02:45:27,610
Partially.
I think you sound great.

3315
02:45:31,070 --> 02:45:34,540
You sound great.
I know you guys sound great.

3316
02:45:34,570 --> 02:45:37,690
What?
Come on and sing a song.

3317
02:45:38,200 --> 02:45:39,490
Do you want to do that?
When I read this up,

3318
02:45:39,510 --> 02:45:40,343
we'd been doing for three hours and 20 
minutes and then we started a little 

3319
02:45:46,630 --> 02:45:48,880
late so yeah,
but it's 5:20

3320
02:45:49,920 --> 02:45:52,030
to 45.
Oh really?

3321
02:45:52,050 --> 02:45:52,883
Yeah.
Oh,

3322
02:45:52,890 --> 02:45:56,460
one of the things that a 2:00
we didn't.

3323
02:45:56,770 --> 02:46:01,600
We did another podcast afterward.
That's how we broke it in half.

3324
02:46:02,920 --> 02:46:04,810
Then what do you want to play?
Whatever.

3325
02:46:05,680 --> 02:46:09,650
so we have solo records coming out.
Oh sure.

3326
02:46:09,730 --> 02:46:10,160
You guys

3327
02:46:10,160 --> 02:46:12,380
practice together with your solo shit?
We did.

3328
02:46:12,381 --> 02:46:13,970
We did.
Because we support each other.

3329
02:46:14,390 --> 02:46:17,270
We sure did.
And do on my record.

3330
02:46:17,271 --> 02:46:19,640
Comes out August 11th.
That's my birthday.

3331
02:46:19,760 --> 02:46:24,760
Is it really what?
Joe was like an old man.

3332
02:46:25,340 --> 02:46:28,040
You want to come to my release on August
10th in la?

3333
02:46:29,180 --> 02:46:30,800
You are welcome.
All right.

3334
02:46:32,870 --> 02:46:34,340
Shit.
I don't have a release date.

3335
02:46:34,341 --> 02:46:37,230
I gotta get my shit together.
A beautiful record.

3336
02:46:40,860 --> 02:46:45,860
Shit blowing me,
man.

3337
02:46:47,270 --> 02:46:48,103
Music,

3338
02:46:48,810 --> 02:46:51,190
Let's pull your song first.
Oh jesus.

3339
02:46:51,210 --> 02:46:53,990
You want to do that pressure?
Get deep here.

3340
02:46:55,270 --> 02:46:56,660
I couldn't probably.
I'm not ready.

3341
02:46:56,661 --> 02:47:01,661
I couldn't possibly do you like.
Oh,

3342
02:47:02,450 --> 02:47:04,040
you're not going to play on it.
You just didn't sing.

3343
02:47:04,070 --> 02:47:04,701
I can.
Here we go.

3344
02:47:04,701 --> 02:47:05,430
Okay.
All right.

3345
02:47:05,430 --> 02:47:06,263
Okay.
You can do the instrumental part which 

3346
02:47:09,580 --> 02:47:11,600
is called.
It's called everlasting peace.

3347
02:47:11,601 --> 02:47:13,220
So shit.
Shit.

3348
02:47:14,430 --> 02:47:19,430
Sot nom there go.
Some days I'll wake up in a sweat bodies

3349
02:47:21,281 --> 02:47:26,281
with from the tension they beam.
Okay.

3350
02:47:28,360 --> 02:47:29,193
With all these cheap thrills from 
tangible achievements weighing heavy on 

3351
02:47:32,861 --> 02:47:33,694
my

3352
02:47:38,000 --> 02:47:43,000
show me.
You're the only one who can bring me the

3353
02:47:46,820 --> 02:47:50,180
show me.
You're the only one who can be.

3354
02:47:50,440 --> 02:47:52,780
Amy.
Please,

3355
02:48:02,660 --> 02:48:03,493
so I could pass a walk,
lift me up like daytime talk like arena 

3356
02:48:07,821 --> 02:48:08,940
rock and I

3357
02:48:09,130 --> 02:48:12,170
sing it to you soft and sweet

3358
02:48:12,630 --> 02:48:16,990
from the questions.
Tom,

3359
02:48:18,140 --> 02:48:22,370
you're the only one who can bring the 
everlasting,

3360
02:48:22,460 --> 02:48:27,460
the show me the last thing.

3361
02:48:38,170 --> 02:48:39,003
That'd be a violin solo,
but we don't have the violin render 

3362
02:48:40,790 --> 02:48:44,390
here.
We'll skip that part.

3363
02:48:46,760 --> 02:48:49,240
I say it that.
I don't mean

3364
02:48:50,920 --> 02:48:51,753
don't want to come from my knees.
Don't want to lose myself in some days 

3365
02:48:57,101 --> 02:49:00,460
guys,
but I know.

3366
02:49:03,720 --> 02:49:05,320
No.

3367
02:49:11,450 --> 02:49:16,450
Show me the only lasting p.
Tom,

3368
02:49:20,390 --> 02:49:25,390
your the only one who can bring the ama.
Ama.

3369
02:49:29,710 --> 02:49:31,530
Ask me.

3370
02:49:35,410 --> 02:49:36,243
Dude,
you guys have such a good sound 

3371
02:49:39,121 --> 02:49:43,160
together.
That's two people that have been working

3372
02:49:43,161 --> 02:49:47,960
together for a long time to know each 
other's sound.

3373
02:49:48,360 --> 02:49:51,860
I might have messed that up a little bit
for ben and make difference.

3374
02:49:51,890 --> 02:49:53,460
How'd you mess it up?
Oh,

3375
02:49:53,480 --> 02:49:54,313
you know it's new stuff.
It's like I'm Just going to shut my 

3376
02:49:58,280 --> 02:50:01,590
mouth and open it up with singing.
okay.

3377
02:50:03,900 --> 02:50:06,550
We're gonna do now.
I'm.

3378
02:50:07,450 --> 02:50:08,900
This is.
This is my single

3379
02:50:09,140 --> 02:50:11,120
off my new record that comes out on your
Birthday.

3380
02:50:11,820 --> 02:50:13,070
Oh,
ghost in my bed.

3381
02:50:14,120 --> 02:50:15,480
Um,
it wasn't music

3382
02:50:15,600 --> 02:50:17,460
video out for it.
Now if anyone wants,

3383
02:50:17,500 --> 02:50:19,530
where does someone get that?
Because youtube.

3384
02:50:19,560 --> 02:50:21,450
Is that okay?
It's on youtube.

3385
02:50:21,780 --> 02:50:22,613
Youtube and uh,
coincidentally eight is kcrws toone of 

3386
02:50:26,201 --> 02:50:28,760
the day today.
I don't even know how that's possible.

3387
02:50:28,870 --> 02:50:29,703
Well,

3388
02:50:32,620 --> 02:50:33,760
it's a little loud.
Okay.

3389
02:50:34,090 --> 02:50:37,930
I'm going to tune it up like a real 
professional turned up with your phone.

3390
02:50:38,060 --> 02:50:38,893
No.
Yeah.

3391
02:50:40,340 --> 02:50:41,560
Really?
Yes.

3392
02:50:41,561 --> 02:50:42,394
Joseph.
They have these things that the 

3393
02:50:45,640 --> 02:50:47,440
instruments.
What is it on your phone?

3394
02:50:47,441 --> 02:50:49,300
Like I'm totally ignorant to this.

3395
02:50:49,310 --> 02:50:54,310
What is this microphone frequency?
Right?

3396
02:50:56,360 --> 02:50:57,410
What is it called?
Just an app.

3397
02:50:57,411 --> 02:50:59,750
It's a guitar tuner.
Just hundreds of them.

3398
02:50:59,830 --> 02:51:01,860
Oh wow.
There's a bunch of them here.

3399
02:51:01,880 --> 02:51:04,610
What are you singing right now?
Wow.

3400
02:51:04,611 --> 02:51:05,444
And it works off of the microphone on 
your phone the same way one would work 

3401
02:51:09,470 --> 02:51:13,690
sonically.
It could be at a better situation.

3402
02:51:14,180 --> 02:51:16,310
Should I give it another angle?
No,

3403
02:51:16,311 --> 02:51:17,350
that's fine.
That's fine.

3404
02:51:17,430 --> 02:51:19,280
Okay.
You want to do this?

3405
02:51:25,120 --> 02:51:25,953
Wait,
should I get my pick or should I go 

3406
02:51:27,030 --> 02:51:28,880
fingers?
you get your pig pen.

3407
02:51:29,040 --> 02:51:33,890
Like a real pig with you constantly 
Because I'm playing all fingers.

3408
02:51:33,891 --> 02:51:36,200
these shirts.
What's that at?

3409
02:51:36,201 --> 02:51:37,480
There might be one.
Oh,

3410
02:51:37,520 --> 02:51:38,353
there are.
Fuck.

3411
02:51:39,770 --> 02:51:41,150
Are you sure?
I'm just kinda picked bro.

3412
02:51:42,310 --> 02:51:43,143
I'm done with them.

3413
02:51:59,730 --> 02:52:04,730
Stomping around my drinking

3414
02:52:06,650 --> 02:52:11,650
booze.
He makes me thinks it's so funny.

3415
02:52:22,070 --> 02:52:23,940
Yeah.

3416
02:52:35,320 --> 02:52:40,320
Car and says,
oh lord kids.

3417
02:55:02,950 --> 02:55:03,783
The

3418
02:55:46,350 --> 02:55:51,350
kcrw song.
That was awesome.

3419
02:55:56,430 --> 02:55:57,770
Thanks.
My pleasure.

3420
02:55:58,370 --> 02:56:00,410
Here's the shit.
I took my headphones off.

3421
02:56:00,411 --> 02:56:03,920
I hope I didn't ruin the beautiful.
Perfect.

3422
02:56:03,980 --> 02:56:06,060
Don't say a word here.
Everyone's fine.

3423
02:56:10,930 --> 02:56:12,350
Should we do more?
Should we go eat?

3424
02:56:12,990 --> 02:56:13,810
It's up to you.
Dude.

3425
02:56:13,810 --> 02:56:18,290
Do you guys want to do.
I'll do one more sweep.

3426
02:56:18,560 --> 02:56:19,393
Well,
here's the thing.

3427
02:56:19,400 --> 02:56:20,233
We're going to be on a tv show.
Did we tell him about that on August 

3428
02:56:24,560 --> 02:56:25,393
3rd?
We're on a show on tbs called the guest 

3429
02:56:27,000 --> 02:56:27,833
book and we wrote a bunch of music for 
it and we are on every episode of this 

3430
02:56:33,620 --> 02:56:36,620
half hour comedy.
What we play.

3431
02:56:36,621 --> 02:56:40,580
I played the mail lady who delivers the 
mail and ben plays the exterminator.

3432
02:56:40,581 --> 02:56:41,680
Wait a minute,
you guys here.

3433
02:56:41,681 --> 02:56:43,580
You put music in your acting on the 
show.

3434
02:56:44,450 --> 02:56:47,000
We got paid a sag actors.
What is this show?

3435
02:56:47,640 --> 02:56:49,670
You know,
so there was a show called.

3436
02:56:49,671 --> 02:56:50,500
My name is earl,
you know,

3437
02:56:50,500 --> 02:56:51,333
that's.
Yes.

3438
02:56:51,580 --> 02:56:52,970
Okay.
So the guy greg garcia.

3439
02:56:53,470 --> 02:56:55,010
Great job.
By the way.

3440
02:56:55,190 --> 02:56:57,770
Greg garcia loves you and you should 
have him on the show.

3441
02:56:57,800 --> 02:57:00,210
He's an amazing guy.
Wonderful.

3442
02:57:00,220 --> 02:57:03,590
Also talked about doing something at a 
meeting with him a lot.

3443
02:57:03,620 --> 02:57:07,210
You should have him on the show.
I can help fucking make that connection.

3444
02:57:07,220 --> 02:57:08,053
So convention.

3445
02:57:10,030 --> 02:57:11,760
I would love to.
I liked that guy.

3446
02:57:12,120 --> 02:57:12,930
Yeah,
he's a great.

3447
02:57:12,930 --> 02:57:14,850
So what happened?
So they just,

3448
02:57:14,910 --> 02:57:15,743
they needed a band.
I guess they were looking at kind of 

3449
02:57:17,401 --> 02:57:19,260
like a spur of the moment thing.
Greg is like,

3450
02:57:19,261 --> 02:57:20,094
okay,
I'm thinking there's going to be a band 

3451
02:57:21,030 --> 02:57:21,863
that closes out every episode.
Kind of transitions between the strip 

3452
02:57:24,091 --> 02:57:27,330
club,
the episodes and a friend of ours.

3453
02:57:27,870 --> 02:57:29,890
Oh my gosh.
The show.

3454
02:57:30,540 --> 02:57:33,060
Oh my god.
Or jamie presley.

3455
02:57:34,380 --> 02:57:36,690
This is crazy.
Damn.

3456
02:57:36,691 --> 02:57:40,500
Now I want to watch this show.
I love him so much.

3457
02:57:40,501 --> 02:57:42,540
Did you guys work with jamie?
Yeah,

3458
02:57:42,541 --> 02:57:45,360
once the.
We got to do a scene in aa with her.

3459
02:57:45,361 --> 02:57:49,230
It was really fun.
I did a terrible movie with her weight,

3460
02:57:50,290 --> 02:57:51,960
never went anywhere.
Is it called?

3461
02:57:51,961 --> 02:57:54,150
I don't remember,
but she was super nice.

3462
02:57:54,480 --> 02:57:55,460
Oh,
danny pudi.

3463
02:57:55,520 --> 02:58:00,520
Oh,
he's is this the guestbook premiers

3464
02:58:02,310 --> 02:58:05,720
August 3rd and it's on tbs.
It'll look.

3465
02:58:05,740 --> 02:58:07,980
He's got all the things I want weirdos 
in a log cabin,

3466
02:58:08,010 --> 02:58:10,800
boom song that didn't make it on the 
show,

3467
02:58:10,830 --> 02:58:14,790
but what the fuck happened?
That song punk kid.

3468
02:58:15,000 --> 02:58:18,020
Like where's that at?
What's the status of that song honeys?

3469
02:58:18,080 --> 02:58:21,480
Fourth record when we're ready to make a
great song.

3470
02:58:21,630 --> 02:58:22,463
And that song,
like the riff from that song was on my 

3471
02:58:24,751 --> 02:58:27,180
denver comedy special rocky mountain 
high,

3472
02:58:29,750 --> 02:58:33,060
but I love that song.
That song is fucking great.

3473
02:58:33,061 --> 02:58:38,061
Like what happened?
It will on our last record was a snafu.

3474
02:58:38,640 --> 02:58:39,473
There was some kind of label politics a 
little bit like it was a little more 

3475
02:58:44,461 --> 02:58:47,040
rock and roll and it wasn't as americana
and it just,

3476
02:58:47,100 --> 02:58:47,933
it was our choice to keep it off.
Eventually it got turned around and 

3477
02:58:50,581 --> 02:58:53,130
around and around,
but that is a song that we.

3478
02:58:53,220 --> 02:58:54,053
This was a couple years ago,
we came out here to work with a great 

3479
02:58:55,591 --> 02:58:59,460
dude and kiefer's chancy a cnco,
um,

3480
02:58:59,790 --> 02:59:00,623
and we just did a set and there was that
and a couple other songs that we did 

3481
02:59:03,030 --> 02:59:04,050
that,
that were ours.

3482
02:59:04,051 --> 02:59:05,660
We own this music,
but when things are,

3483
02:59:05,690 --> 02:59:07,770
we owned it and they didn't want to pay 
for it,

3484
02:59:07,960 --> 02:59:10,740
they didn't want it,
so we were going to record,

3485
02:59:10,741 --> 02:59:13,590
they would have owned it and not have.
So we were like,

3486
02:59:13,591 --> 02:59:14,424
fuck,
we put all this effort into this song 

3487
02:59:15,461 --> 02:59:18,840
and we love this song,
but it was just that thing where like we

3488
02:59:18,841 --> 02:59:21,990
had to fight for it and it's a great 
song and it's not going anywhere.

3489
02:59:22,020 --> 02:59:22,860
It'll,
it'll come,

3490
02:59:22,861 --> 02:59:23,694
it'll come out eventually.
Dirty people don't know about that song 

3491
02:59:27,841 --> 02:59:28,674
though.

3492
02:59:30,340 --> 02:59:33,810
Bar ilan myths.
We played it here.

3493
02:59:33,880 --> 02:59:34,750
Oh,
that's right.

3494
02:59:35,270 --> 02:59:40,270
They played back in the desert.
So both those classes,

3495
02:59:41,790 --> 02:59:45,200
it never made it on anything else other 
than that youtube videos at all.

3496
02:59:45,230 --> 02:59:46,710
Anything else where people can listen to
it?

3497
02:59:47,350 --> 02:59:48,510
Well,
we put it out.

3498
02:59:48,511 --> 02:59:49,344
People downloaded it.
We used it to raise money for this 

3499
02:59:51,990 --> 02:59:52,823
vehicle.
So we never put it down on rates on 

3500
02:59:55,410 --> 02:59:56,550
spotify.
It's only,

3501
02:59:56,551 --> 02:59:59,250
you guys own it.
So if we played it,

3502
02:59:59,460 --> 03:00:00,293
it wouldn't.
It wouldn't like trip any alarms or 

3503
03:00:02,131 --> 03:00:02,760
anything.
Right.

3504
03:00:02,760 --> 03:00:04,630
You can play it anytime you want with 
that shit right now.

3505
03:00:05,650 --> 03:00:08,160
Go cook.
You find it?

3506
03:00:08,420 --> 03:00:10,030
I can buy the version they played for 
sure.

3507
03:00:10,100 --> 03:00:13,430
See if I can see of the.
Not the burden they played here.

3508
03:00:13,830 --> 03:00:14,663
Let's see if there's another version of 
it that you can find like the pure 

3509
03:00:16,411 --> 03:00:17,940
studio version because it's so good.

3510
03:00:18,900 --> 03:00:20,190
That was a cool one.
What's the.

3511
03:00:20,191 --> 03:00:22,170
Uh,
I bet he loved that song.

3512
03:00:22,530 --> 03:00:24,930
There was like one of my favorite on the
new album came out.

3513
03:00:24,931 --> 03:00:25,800
I was like,
where's the song?

3514
03:00:25,801 --> 03:00:28,020
Whereas punk kid,
it was a big debate.

3515
03:00:28,170 --> 03:00:33,000
Who is a real thing of the fockers 
motherfuckers know you.

3516
03:00:33,230 --> 03:00:34,063
You just got to keep forging ahead and 
figuring out how to maintain your 

3517
03:00:37,891 --> 03:00:41,040
integrity and also what you've worked 
for.

3518
03:00:41,041 --> 03:00:44,370
And that was,
we just didn't want to give it up.

3519
03:00:44,371 --> 03:00:45,720
We didn't want someone else to be like,
yeah,

3520
03:00:45,721 --> 03:00:46,770
we own this.
Well,

3521
03:00:46,771 --> 03:00:47,604
I'm glad you didn't,
but I can't imagine how you guys do it 

3522
03:00:49,051 --> 03:00:52,000
because if that was me and I like,
I found out that my jokes like,

3523
03:00:52,020 --> 03:00:52,853
uh,
a bit that I did that I worked really 

3524
03:00:53,611 --> 03:00:56,130
long and hard on all of a sudden if I 
wanted to put it on a special,

3525
03:00:56,131 --> 03:00:58,290
someone else who's going to own it 
without even paying me for it,

3526
03:00:58,291 --> 03:00:59,560
I'd be like,
fuck you,

3527
03:00:59,561 --> 03:01:00,580
man.
That's crazy.

3528
03:01:00,581 --> 03:01:03,070
This is why I'm making my own furniture 
for my apartment.

3529
03:01:07,000 --> 03:01:09,610
I'm happy you want to word this 
computer.

3530
03:01:09,611 --> 03:01:11,920
It's on another computer.
Hold on y'all.

3531
03:01:12,100 --> 03:01:13,810
What is it?
Is it on spotify?

3532
03:01:13,811 --> 03:01:15,760
Is that what you guys said?
That don't have it anywhere.

3533
03:01:15,761 --> 03:01:18,210
That's why my itunes.
You want me to.

3534
03:01:19,260 --> 03:01:19,771
Oh,
here it is.

3535
03:01:19,771 --> 03:01:21,340
I got it right here.
Can we do.

3536
03:01:21,430 --> 03:01:22,770
How do I send it to you?
Jamie?

3537
03:01:23,750 --> 03:01:25,270
You can plug it in there.
You've got an ox.

3538
03:01:25,271 --> 03:01:27,910
No,
it's one of those stupid ass.

3539
03:01:29,350 --> 03:01:33,780
God damn fucking isilon's.
Android phones have an ox.

3540
03:01:34,060 --> 03:01:38,830
What can I do?
Okay.

3541
03:01:41,490 --> 03:01:44,470
I've seriously considered enjoyed 
several times.

3542
03:01:44,830 --> 03:01:46,720
Here's a new one.
This new.

3543
03:01:47,830 --> 03:01:48,740
Here we go.
I got it,

3544
03:01:49,600 --> 03:01:53,920
a google pixel two's coming out and then
also the new galaxy s eight.

3545
03:01:54,220 --> 03:01:55,980
It doesn't set on fire.
No,

3546
03:01:55,990 --> 03:01:57,880
the new.
The note eight is the one.

3547
03:01:58,090 --> 03:02:01,420
The note seven was the one that went on 
fire to the galaxy seven.

3548
03:02:01,420 --> 03:02:03,450
Never went out all over the airports 
too.

3549
03:02:03,451 --> 03:02:04,060
It's like,
oh,

3550
03:02:04,060 --> 03:02:05,490
just so you know.
Yeah,

3551
03:02:05,530 --> 03:02:09,730
so there's the galaxy s eight is dope.
I've thought about that one.

3552
03:02:09,731 --> 03:02:12,850
And then the galaxy note eight,
which is coming out soon.

3553
03:02:12,900 --> 03:02:15,850
It's pretty killer to there.
They're just as good as iphones now.

3554
03:02:15,851 --> 03:02:18,160
It's just getting off the apple tit is 
the issue.

3555
03:02:18,850 --> 03:02:19,683
You know apple,
the apple tit that connects you to ipod 

3556
03:02:22,580 --> 03:02:27,340
or itunes,
it makes your life more convenient,

3557
03:02:27,520 --> 03:02:29,500
but I'm on the google to too.
I love google.

3558
03:02:30,280 --> 03:02:32,340
I use it all the time.
It's a juicy one.

3559
03:02:32,341 --> 03:02:35,140
It's at least a d cup.
So much information.

3560
03:02:35,880 --> 03:02:36,713
I mean what I mean,
if I had to choose between a company 

3561
03:02:38,051 --> 03:02:40,840
that I rely on more,
if I could just use a google phone,

3562
03:02:41,260 --> 03:02:42,890
but I could still use google.
Right.

3563
03:02:43,380 --> 03:02:45,130
Well you got to go with google,
right?

3564
03:02:45,160 --> 03:02:45,993
That's giant.
I used that way more than I use 

3565
03:02:47,711 --> 03:02:49,510
anything.
I was like googling things.

3566
03:02:50,230 --> 03:02:51,220
I mean,
who doesn't?

3567
03:02:51,400 --> 03:02:53,810
You need to know shit.
I need to.

3568
03:02:54,600 --> 03:02:57,160
My shoe size and european size.
Very big.

3569
03:02:57,250 --> 03:02:58,083
That's a good one.
If you wanted to order some shoes from 

3570
03:03:00,251 --> 03:03:03,470
oversees 1400 feet as well.
I do,

3571
03:03:04,020 --> 03:03:05,200
yeah.
Sasquatch feet.

3572
03:03:06,070 --> 03:03:06,903
Big ass.
Why?

3573
03:03:07,320 --> 03:03:10,600
I could probably out foot theaters.
London.

3574
03:03:10,601 --> 03:03:12,280
Him?
Yeah.

3575
03:03:12,281 --> 03:03:14,570
I've been on this trail.
Run and kick.

3576
03:03:15,380 --> 03:03:16,213
Aromatase feet.
Choose those five finger shoes are fun 

3577
03:03:19,300 --> 03:03:21,690
people.
I've never seen a foot product generates

3578
03:03:21,691 --> 03:03:26,691
so much hate.
Were those vibram fivefingers shoes?

3579
03:03:27,290 --> 03:03:29,440
TheY don't like the way it looks.
how do you feel about it?

3580
03:03:29,530 --> 03:03:30,363
I don't give a fuck.
How do you wear a fanny pack at the 

3581
03:03:36,430 --> 03:03:38,050
grocery store?
The other lump me in with him.

3582
03:03:38,051 --> 03:03:39,240
Make me get rid of my numBers.
Kid.

3583
03:03:39,490 --> 03:03:40,680
He had a fanny pack.
Sorry.

3584
03:03:40,780 --> 03:03:45,080
But a lot of people were them now 
because he knew you were.

3585
03:03:45,160 --> 03:03:49,400
She didn't know that you knew.
How do I feel when I wear them as though

3586
03:03:49,401 --> 03:03:52,810
you're saying it's hard because I'm 
running.

3587
03:03:52,890 --> 03:03:56,050
I'm rocky hills and I'm running a lot of
miles,

3588
03:03:56,320 --> 03:03:57,830
so like three miles on these

3589
03:03:58,010 --> 03:04:00,610
various great porn star name.
Sorry.

3590
03:04:01,850 --> 03:04:04,670
Ridiculous tits.
Just jesus.

3591
03:04:04,730 --> 03:04:09,730
what the fuck Is this?
Out of her shirt?

3592
03:04:11,810 --> 03:04:14,000
That's rocky hills.
But um,

3593
03:04:14,360 --> 03:04:15,193
it's tricky.
Like today I ran him in like a under 

3594
03:04:17,121 --> 03:04:18,800
armour trail shoes,
which I gotta be honest.

3595
03:04:18,801 --> 03:04:21,830
I kinda liked Better because you can 
just run full on.

3596
03:04:22,730 --> 03:04:24,710
they have a lot of great shit.
I'm wondering if there,

3597
03:04:24,810 --> 03:04:25,643
there,
uh,

3598
03:04:25,700 --> 03:04:28,550
one of the most eco,
a athletic lines.

3599
03:04:28,551 --> 03:04:29,860
That's really.
Yeah.

3600
03:04:30,680 --> 03:04:34,040
They're also one of the very few big 
companies that support huntIng.

3601
03:04:34,070 --> 03:04:34,903
They have a whole hunting line and that,
that means that's a choice to endorse 

3602
03:04:39,231 --> 03:04:39,681
honey.
Honey.

3603
03:04:39,681 --> 03:04:42,350
We are willing and ready.
Big fan.

3604
03:04:42,380 --> 03:04:43,213
Big fan of under armour.
The gauntlet has been thrown down for 

3605
03:04:45,590 --> 03:04:48,290
rock and roll.
Are you ready to expand stage where?

3606
03:04:48,300 --> 03:04:49,133
Holy shit,
where I've always wanted to have track 

3607
03:04:51,530 --> 03:04:52,363
suits for the whole band,
like when we're loading in because they 

3608
03:04:53,811 --> 03:04:54,950
have to like do a lot of work.

3609
03:04:54,980 --> 03:04:56,670
But Let me be honest.
if you get a track suit,

3610
03:04:56,680 --> 03:04:58,890
don't you have to get adidas?
Keep call,

3611
03:04:59,250 --> 03:05:03,050
maybe bombs,
sign a little hip hop.

3612
03:05:04,410 --> 03:05:09,410
I'm slurring my words phone about you.
Play pool real good right now though,

3613
03:05:10,420 --> 03:05:11,940
right?
Let's fucking do this.

3614
03:05:13,790 --> 03:05:16,790
We played pool earlier and I did not 
play my best,

3615
03:05:16,791 --> 03:05:19,700
but you know what was bizarre and just 
beat joe so badly.

3616
03:05:19,730 --> 03:05:22,130
Maybe you weren't given us the full 
juice.

3617
03:05:22,220 --> 03:05:25,790
We came down to it to games.
We just right down ball the ball,

3618
03:05:26,240 --> 03:05:28,430
but you played it so much better than 
us.

3619
03:05:29,390 --> 03:05:30,223
Oh,
here we go.

3620
03:05:32,830 --> 03:05:33,770
she called me.
My god.

3621
03:05:33,771 --> 03:05:36,680
This is good night.
Ladies and gentlemen.

3622
03:05:36,681 --> 03:05:37,400
Honey.
Honey.

3623
03:05:37,400 --> 03:05:39,590
Suzanne santo.
New album on August 11th.

3624
03:05:48,690 --> 03:05:52,280
No.
Yeah,

3625
03:05:53,820 --> 03:05:54,970
I'll bet you

3626
03:05:57,230 --> 03:06:02,230
it sounds like shit.
Hold on till it.

3627
03:06:04,470 --> 03:06:07,110
The audio quality's terrible.
It got compressed my sentence.

3628
03:06:07,170 --> 03:06:09,540
I texted it to myself.
Oh yeah.

3629
03:06:09,541 --> 03:06:12,150
That sounds like that shit was coming 
out of a title so you know,

3630
03:06:12,151 --> 03:06:16,530
it could sound better than.
That sounds way better than I realized I

3631
03:06:16,531 --> 03:06:17,610
had to stop it.
I was like,

3632
03:06:17,611 --> 03:06:20,220
there's no way I could have that 
represent that song.

3633
03:06:20,460 --> 03:06:21,900
There's no way to get it through a 
computer.

3634
03:06:21,901 --> 03:06:24,780
You have to text it to yourself.
I'm trying to get it and it's not.

3635
03:06:24,781 --> 03:06:26,520
My phone is not connected to the 
computer right now.

3636
03:06:26,521 --> 03:06:28,640
I don't know why or I can't.
Like he's.

3637
03:06:28,680 --> 03:06:30,700
He texted it to me.
It's to be complicated.

3638
03:06:30,701 --> 03:06:33,780
If jamie can't get at it was.
It was impressive.

3639
03:06:33,781 --> 03:06:34,730
Impressive.
Yeah.

3640
03:06:35,200 --> 03:06:38,540
That was a nice like feed myself and 
that wouldn't,

3641
03:06:38,630 --> 03:06:40,560
would have been perfect song wasn't 
attached in the email.

3642
03:06:41,100 --> 03:06:43,290
Lots of dIfferent things.
So there's no other way to get it.

3643
03:06:43,610 --> 03:06:44,443
Uh,
well don't you guys have a way that you 

3644
03:06:45,901 --> 03:06:48,270
can tell people if someone says,
hey ben,

3645
03:06:48,540 --> 03:06:50,910
I heard your punk kid song is really 
awesome.

3646
03:06:51,180 --> 03:06:53,870
Where can I go about hearing that?
I'll,

3647
03:06:54,060 --> 03:06:56,280
I'll let them know where is it,

3648
03:06:56,420 --> 03:06:59,520
where is it?
Then we did on soundcloud.

3649
03:06:59,550 --> 03:07:04,020
We can do that right before we got on 
the podcast was like organize our social

3650
03:07:04,021 --> 03:07:04,854
media because our honey honey website 
looks like our records just coming out 

3651
03:07:08,401 --> 03:07:11,790
and it came out three years ago,
but we're working on that.

3652
03:07:11,791 --> 03:07:12,624
This is part of the diy conundrum.
It's also part of the promoting artists 

3653
03:07:16,380 --> 03:07:17,213
conundrum because like the thing that 
makes you a really good artists also 

3654
03:07:19,440 --> 03:07:21,780
makes you shit at promoting.
It's hard.

3655
03:07:22,310 --> 03:07:23,143
It's a lot,
but that's what's cool about getting 

3656
03:07:26,250 --> 03:07:29,670
teams around you like mess with you and 
they get weird.

3657
03:07:30,100 --> 03:07:32,390
No,

3658
03:07:32,400 --> 03:07:35,130
Honestly you having a as your thing.

3660
03:07:37,200 --> 03:07:38,033
I get this game changer for you guys.
Could figure out how to get one of your 

3661
03:07:41,851 --> 03:07:44,980
favorite fucking song and play it shit.

3662
03:07:46,990 --> 03:07:48,810
I feel like it'S time to go barbecue 
now.

3663
03:07:49,080 --> 03:07:51,060
We're defInitely going to a barbecue.
We're just gonna play the song.

3664
03:07:51,061 --> 03:07:54,700
Then we're going to barbecue.
What else to say?

3665
03:07:55,020 --> 03:07:55,853
Vegas this weekend,
friday night I'll be at the theater at

3667
03:08:02,090 --> 03:08:02,923
how fun.
Little diaper and they connect to the 

3668
03:08:08,600 --> 03:08:11,070
diaper and the climate.
A lot of money to see that.

3669
03:08:12,500 --> 03:08:14,490
No,
they have this crazy setup back there.

3670
03:08:14,491 --> 03:08:15,324
We don't use it.
We just use a flat stage but the setups 

3671
03:08:16,600 --> 03:08:19,850
and go,

Oh,

3678
03:08:37,280 --> 03:08:41,400

so we have no solution so far.

3679
03:08:41,401 --> 03:08:44,380
this is insane.
Was such a.

3680
03:08:46,400 --> 03:08:49,260
I mean,
you know it gets compressed.

3681
03:08:49,680 --> 03:08:50,930
It shouldn't though.
Yeah.

3682
03:08:50,950 --> 03:08:51,783
The texting did if you can.
It wasn't attached to the email and I 

3683
03:08:53,821 --> 03:08:57,430
tried to put my email in there so I 
didn't a different route through email.

3684
03:08:58,140 --> 03:09:00,210
This is not going to work.
People wAnt to fight it.

3685

3687
03:09:03,990 --> 03:09:05,940
You want to see it?
You could just forward them to me.

3688
03:09:07,530 --> 03:09:10,130
Have you gotten dick pics before?
Yeah,

3689
03:09:10,140 --> 03:09:12,180

3690
03:09:12,630 --> 03:09:14,820
Well it depends on if I am into it or 
not,

3691
03:09:16,050 --> 03:09:19,320
but there's a great dick pic,
which is the actual.

3692
03:09:19,710 --> 03:09:24,710
It's got dressed them up at the dicks 
hats.

3693
03:09:25,270 --> 03:09:26,103
You ever see that one?
That do to turn this into a dragon and 

3694
03:09:28,501 --> 03:09:33,120
he put tattoos all over his dick and 
shit and that sounds awful.

3700
03:09:52,890 --> 03:09:55,830
It's time.

3710
03:10:19,301 --> 03:10:20,720
I'm going to send you a dick pic.
No,

3711
03:10:21,010 --> 03:10:21,843
you don't have to make them all.
Have you seen the one with the guy who 

3712
03:10:26,801 --> 03:10:31,000
was a football player or anyone you 
know?

3713
03:10:31,090 --> 03:10:32,710
Should we end this?
I feel like we should just.

3714
03:10:32,740 --> 03:10:33,290

3718
03:10:38,980 --> 03:10:39,351

3722
03:10:44,681 --> 03:10:45,940

3725
03:10:48,450 --> 03:10:49,270
Okay,

3726
03:10:49,270 --> 03:10:51,640

Is it still daylight outside?

3727
03:10:51,690 --> 03:10:52,390
Uh,
yes.

3728
03:10:52,390 --> 03:10:55,270
He's still so apm now.
Oh my god.

3729
03:10:55,300 --> 03:10:57,670
I was shooting bows and arrows.
It's 7:45

3730
03:10:57,671 --> 03:10:58,670
the other day.
You were?

3731
03:10:58,970 --> 03:11:01,000
Yeah.
It was clear enough to the target.

3732
03:11:01,020 --> 03:11:02,380
You shoot them into the abyss.

3733
03:11:05,440 --> 03:11:09,090
Where do you shoot?
Your arrow is old unfortunate spots.

3734
03:11:09,120 --> 03:11:11,080
So I just sent it to you.
Okay.

3735
03:11:11,150 --> 03:11:11,631
Well,
how's that?

3736
03:11:11,631 --> 03:11:13,420
Gonna work.
Okay.

3737
03:11:14,020 --> 03:11:15,920
And you send it to jamie and it didn't 
work because I don't have.

3738
03:11:16,030 --> 03:11:19,660
I mean that's what it's feeling like.
Hey,

3739
03:11:20,140 --> 03:11:23,610
did reach out to your lava lamps?
I'm just gonna say that right at school.

3740
03:11:25,540 --> 03:11:30,540
I feel entranced by the trying to go as 
hippie as I can without being a hippie.

3741
03:11:32,170 --> 03:11:33,070
I get.
Okay.

3742
03:11:33,071 --> 03:11:33,904
Jamie has salt rock lamp.
I'm just going to say that that's got a 

3743
03:11:36,881 --> 03:11:38,890
couple of those.
One of them died on us.

3744
03:11:39,480 --> 03:11:40,540
Yeah,
very sad.

3745
03:11:40,750 --> 03:11:43,900
Did it lose its positive ions?
That's a good question.

3746
03:11:45,060 --> 03:11:45,893
Uh,
I think it's just the power cable 

3747
03:11:47,920 --> 03:11:49,240
crapped out.
That one's dead,

3748
03:11:49,241 --> 03:11:50,530
right?
Is that one not work anymore?

3749
03:11:50,630 --> 03:11:51,251
Yeah.
Yeah.

3750
03:11:51,251 --> 03:11:52,420
That one doesn't work with that one.
Works.

3751
03:11:52,760 --> 03:11:54,600
See that one is lit up and supposedly 
it's a.

3752
03:11:54,610 --> 03:11:55,443
It's a good size.
This next tier marshall amp is that 

3753
03:11:57,401 --> 03:12:02,170
marshall amp also as like a radio?
It's a bluetooth speaker.

3754
03:12:02,880 --> 03:12:04,140
One of those really badly.
Yeah.

3755
03:12:04,240 --> 03:12:05,710
We can have those sound great.
Do you want it?

3756
03:12:06,360 --> 03:12:07,500
It's yours.
You have it.

3757
03:12:08,040 --> 03:12:09,200
Got to clean this place out.
Anyway.
