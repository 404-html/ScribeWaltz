00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,090
Hello everybody this weekend,

2
00:00:05,091 --> 00:00:05,900
Friday,

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,880
December 21st,

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:08,120
2012.

5
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:10,970
It's the end of the world
show at the Wiltern theater.

6
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:11,511
Honey,

7
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:12,344
honey ban.

8
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:12,861
Joey,

9
00:00:12,861 --> 00:00:13,880
Coco Diaz,

10
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:14,251
Doug,

11
00:00:14,251 --> 00:00:15,680
Stan hope and me.

12
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:17,150
Last time we checked,

13
00:00:17,151 --> 00:00:19,370
there was only about hello.

14
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:19,940
Hello.

15
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:20,631
Last time we checked,

16
00:00:20,631 --> 00:00:21,920
there's only about a hundred seats left.

17
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:22,581
So,

18
00:00:22,581 --> 00:00:22,810
uh,

19
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:24,530
if you want to end and no,

20
00:00:24,531 --> 00:00:26,660
we don't think the fucking
world is going to end.

21
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,140
All right,

22
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,130
settle down.

23
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:29,660
You really don't know.

24
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:31,910
Everybody settle down.

25
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:32,960
Um,

26
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,621
also,

27
00:00:33,621 --> 00:00:34,130
uh,

28
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:35,240
what do you got going on this week?

29
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:36,180
Uh,

30
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:36,920
the Improv.

31
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:37,170
Yes,

32
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:37,801
the Improv.

33
00:00:37,801 --> 00:00:41,040
Thursday we're going to try
to do a live podcast there,

34
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:44,070
up above and while we're trying to
do like a nice house chronicles,

35
00:00:44,071 --> 00:00:44,791
but at the Improv,

36
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:45,840
it's a death squad show.

37
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:47,430
Joey Diaz.

38
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:48,360
It's going to be on it.

39
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:49,080
Um,

40
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,850
Jeff Richardson is going to host it.

41
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,650
I don't know if you've
seen Jeff Richards lately.

42
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,240
He is fucking hilarious.

43
00:00:54,241 --> 00:00:54,750
Now.

44
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,130
He's good and he's got the best.

45
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:56,340
Uh,

46
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,390
what's that Jimmy Fallon.

47
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,510
Jimmy Fallon on a roller coaster.

48
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:00,793
Oh,

49
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:01,920
it's hilarious.

50
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:02,400
It will,

51
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,360
it will make it for yourself.

52
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:03,711
But,

53
00:01:03,711 --> 00:01:03,890
uh,

54
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:05,330
I don't think I'm going to pee myself,

55
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:07,400
but thanks for the plug.

56
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:08,811
If you're interested,

57
00:01:08,811 --> 00:01:09,650
people keep asking me,

58
00:01:09,651 --> 00:01:10,311
where do you get those?

59
00:01:10,311 --> 00:01:10,491
Uh,

60
00:01:10,491 --> 00:01:11,760
those crazy cat tee shirts.

61
00:01:11,761 --> 00:01:12,594
A desk bought shirts,

62
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:13,850
go to death squad.

63
00:01:13,851 --> 00:01:14,930
Dot TV.

64
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:15,830
And uh,

65
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:16,611
that also,

66
00:01:16,611 --> 00:01:16,820
uh,

67
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,190
pays to support the desk.

68
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,860
[inaudible] desk squad podcast
network that Brian produces,

69
00:01:21,861 --> 00:01:24,080
which has the excellent Kevin Pereira.

70
00:01:24,081 --> 00:01:25,730
Pointless show on it now.

71
00:01:25,731 --> 00:01:27,200
It's a fucking great show.

72
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,700
All those podcasts are for free.

73
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:32,810
You can get them all
on death squad dot t v.

74
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:33,470
All right,

75
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:34,303
dirty Fox.

76
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:35,660
We're about to start the podcast.

77
00:01:35,661 --> 00:01:38,810
We have Dennis Mckenna here and
we're going to get down to business.

78
00:01:38,811 --> 00:01:42,170
We're going to find out what the fuck is
up the author of the Brotherhood of the

79
00:01:42,171 --> 00:01:43,100
screaming abyss.

80
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:46,450
Well,

81
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:47,900
good experience.

82
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:50,280
Hey Joe Rogan podcast.

83
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,010
What's with the craziness?

84
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:57,550
What are you doing with that sound?

85
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:58,850
So,

86
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:00,690
so Dennis Mckenna,

87
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:01,370
first of all,

88
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:01,590
um,

89
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:02,161
and your friends,

90
00:02:02,161 --> 00:02:02,461
I'm sorry,

91
00:02:02,461 --> 00:02:03,480
I forgot your names cause we,

92
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,720
we might've indulged in something that
makes you forget things really quickly.

93
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,820
Can you put you,

94
00:02:08,821 --> 00:02:09,720
if you can talk into the mic,

95
00:02:09,721 --> 00:02:14,350
if you want to keep the clean
Keith Levers and what was that?

96
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:15,203
No,

97
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:18,500
Katelyn Mckenna.

98
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,633
Caitlin Mckenna.

99
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,990
That's legacy right there.

100
00:02:20,991 --> 00:02:21,824
Ladies and gentlemen.

101
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:22,521
Dennis,

102
00:02:22,521 --> 00:02:22,941
first of all,

103
00:02:22,941 --> 00:02:25,670
thank you very much for coming on and
thank you for sending me your book.

104
00:02:25,671 --> 00:02:26,181
Not once,

105
00:02:26,181 --> 00:02:27,590
not twice but three times.

106
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,480
Thank you,

107
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,070
Joe.

108
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,170
Happy to be here.

109
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:33,590
I want to be sure you got a
copy of the book in your hand.

110
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,010
Yeah,

111
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:35,690
I started reading it in Vegas,

112
00:02:35,691 --> 00:02:37,130
which I think is very ironic,

113
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:38,301
you know,

114
00:02:38,301 --> 00:02:40,660
to be in that the,

115
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:40,901
the,

116
00:02:40,901 --> 00:02:45,200
the darkest of places that mankind is
created and a to start to read this book.

117
00:02:45,201 --> 00:02:45,830
But uh,

118
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:46,101
as,

119
00:02:46,101 --> 00:02:46,430
uh,

120
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:48,890
I have known of you for a long,

121
00:02:48,891 --> 00:02:49,724
long time.

122
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:50,200
Um,

123
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:50,700
I was,

124
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,370
uh,

125
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:51,860
uh,

126
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:55,280
turned on to some of your
brother's stuff through,

127
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:55,820
uh,

128
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:58,190
it was a song someone played me,

129
00:02:58,370 --> 00:02:59,203
not a song.

130
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,400
I'm

131
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,400
a rave that he did where he would
talk over the rave and do like his,

132
00:03:05,981 --> 00:03:06,940
his end of the world.

133
00:03:06,941 --> 00:03:08,170
End of time sort of rant.

134
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:08,650
Yup.

135
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:09,350
Yup.

136
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:10,600
I think it was the,

137
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,950
it was called TimeWave zero,

138
00:03:11,951 --> 00:03:12,610
wasn't it?

139
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:13,391
Like even the,

140
00:03:13,391 --> 00:03:13,661
the,

141
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:14,051
the,

142
00:03:14,051 --> 00:03:14,660
uh,

143
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,090
the,

144
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,000
the piece,

145
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:16,361
yeah.

146
00:03:16,361 --> 00:03:17,200
It couldn't have been it.

147
00:03:17,201 --> 00:03:17,501
I mean,

148
00:03:17,501 --> 00:03:19,600
I know he was in several of those things.

149
00:03:19,601 --> 00:03:21,940
The one I remember is alien dreamed I,

150
00:03:21,941 --> 00:03:22,600
yes.

151
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,081
Yes.

152
00:03:23,081 --> 00:03:24,970
Was that the one and only dream?

153
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:25,151
Tom,

154
00:03:25,151 --> 00:03:27,510
wasn't that like a movie or was that the,

155
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:28,653
that was the south,

156
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,250
that was the album.

157
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:34,840
I think Ken Adams actually who just
recently released a movie called the

158
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:37,420
Terrence Mckenna experience.

159
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,540
It's a documentary.

160
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,471
Well,

161
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:41,711
no,

162
00:03:41,711 --> 00:03:42,610
not exactly.

163
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,120
I mean,

164
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,410
it's old clips,

165
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:44,771
you know,

166
00:03:44,771 --> 00:03:46,330
from other appearances.

167
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,410
Pretty good.

168
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:48,370
Interesting movie.

169
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:50,080
Now,

170
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:50,380
uh,

171
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,900
that one clip that I'd listened to,

172
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,370
um,

173
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:55,390
really may,

174
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:57,220
might have started,

175
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,060
uh,

176
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:02,350
like an entirely new chapter of
my life just because it was so,

177
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:03,011
it was so,

178
00:04:03,011 --> 00:04:03,401
first of all,

179
00:04:03,401 --> 00:04:04,420
it's so freaky,

180
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:04,931
you know,

181
00:04:04,931 --> 00:04:05,471
and it was you,

182
00:04:05,471 --> 00:04:10,471
you never heard anyone talk that way
and your brother had this really odd

183
00:04:10,481 --> 00:04:12,760
inflection that was like,

184
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:13,930
like,

185
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:14,763
uh,

186
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:15,491
when,

187
00:04:15,491 --> 00:04:19,690
when someone is really smart and they
talk with a really odd and flection,

188
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:21,910
you start wondering what's wrong with you.

189
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:22,751
You know,

190
00:04:22,751 --> 00:04:22,931
like,

191
00:04:22,931 --> 00:04:24,280
why am I not talking like this guy?

192
00:04:24,281 --> 00:04:25,114
Like maybe he's right,

193
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:25,950
he's on to something here.

194
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,820
Like they're confident
is to talk like that.

195
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:32,290
Well one of the things that was always
sort of charming about a terrorist was

196
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:34,660
that it didn't really matter what he said.

197
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,100
I mean,

198
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,780
I used to get after him and say
what you said 20 minutes ago,

199
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:42,550
didn't make any sense of it directly
contradicts what you just said,

200
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,650
which also doesn't make any sense,

201
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:45,610
you know.

202
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:46,301
But the thing is,

203
00:04:46,301 --> 00:04:48,850
it doesn't matter because Terry,

204
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:49,990
Terrence,

205
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:53,590
he could read the phone book
and it would have sounded great.

206
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:57,580
That would be hanging on every
word because he just had that gift.

207
00:04:57,581 --> 00:04:57,851
You know,

208
00:04:57,851 --> 00:04:59,470
he had the voice,

209
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,500
he could mesmerize people and he was,

210
00:05:02,501 --> 00:05:02,891
you know,

211
00:05:02,891 --> 00:05:05,200
obviously super intelligent,

212
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,580
widely read,

213
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,350
knew all this stuff,

214
00:05:08,351 --> 00:05:08,801
you know,

215
00:05:08,801 --> 00:05:13,801
as a result of his reading and in the
tussle with program and before that

216
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,520
alchemy and you know,

217
00:05:15,521 --> 00:05:19,120
black magic and eastern
philosophy and all of this stuff.

218
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:19,871
You know,

219
00:05:19,871 --> 00:05:20,081
I mean,

220
00:05:20,081 --> 00:05:25,081
he was by far a much broader
scholar than I'll ever be.

221
00:05:25,121 --> 00:05:25,460
I mean,

222
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:25,840
I'm,

223
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,950
I'm quite narrow.

224
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:27,251
You know,

225
00:05:27,251 --> 00:05:27,491
I mean,

226
00:05:27,491 --> 00:05:28,420
I know science,

227
00:05:28,421 --> 00:05:29,254
that's what I know,

228
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:30,070
you know,

229
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,270
not really.

230
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,510
He was just incredible.

231
00:05:34,511 --> 00:05:36,670
He could draw on so many,

232
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:37,931
you know,

233
00:05:37,931 --> 00:05:39,880
threads of knowledge and,

234
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:42,280
and people were hungry to hear it.

235
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:42,581
I mean,

236
00:05:42,581 --> 00:05:44,200
here was a guy who could say,

237
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:45,551
you know,

238
00:05:45,551 --> 00:05:48,070
he loved provocative statements.

239
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:48,620
Right.

240
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,720
And He'd love to,

241
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,500
you know,

242
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,090
antagonize that,

243
00:05:52,091 --> 00:05:52,510
you know,

244
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:55,570
make people think and people
want it to be challenged,

245
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:56,890
you know?

246
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:57,470
And that,

247
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:59,060
that was part of his appeal,

248
00:05:59,061 --> 00:06:01,100
I think a great deal of his appeal.

249
00:06:01,101 --> 00:06:06,101
I remember in the early eighties
before anybody really got to knew,

250
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,690
know who Terrance was,

251
00:06:08,691 --> 00:06:11,840
but he was out a few radio
clips and that sort of thing.

252
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,340
But back in the early Avs,

253
00:06:13,341 --> 00:06:17,270
do you remember singing along
with Mitch Sing along with Mitch?

254
00:06:17,271 --> 00:06:17,611
What was it?

255
00:06:17,611 --> 00:06:19,310
You were probably too young for this.

256
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:19,821
Yeah.

257
00:06:19,821 --> 00:06:20,870
Sing along with Mitch.

258
00:06:20,871 --> 00:06:22,580
It was like this really cheesy,

259
00:06:22,581 --> 00:06:26,480
stupid a music show with this Guy Mitch.

260
00:06:26,481 --> 00:06:27,314
Uh,

261
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,410
do you remember what his last name was?

262
00:06:30,411 --> 00:06:30,921
I don't know,

263
00:06:30,921 --> 00:06:34,160
but it was all about sing along with
Mitch and he would present the show and

264
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:39,161
they'd sing all these old songs and
he get people in the audience watching

265
00:06:39,531 --> 00:06:40,131
television.

266
00:06:40,131 --> 00:06:41,360
So sing or write.

267
00:06:41,361 --> 00:06:45,260
And so Terrance went on one of these
programs on the moderator said,

268
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:45,651
you know,

269
00:06:45,651 --> 00:06:47,330
you're like sing along with Mitch.

270
00:06:47,331 --> 00:06:50,600
Except it's like think
along with terrorists.

271
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:52,950
Okay.

272
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:53,783
Right.

273
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,610
And it was like that,

274
00:06:55,611 --> 00:06:55,971
you know,

275
00:06:55,971 --> 00:07:00,971
he just stimulated people to think about
things they never really thought about.

276
00:07:02,181 --> 00:07:04,290
So this was the show singalongs mentioned

277
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:09,480
there's a darn good reason
why the excitement here too.

278
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:10,820
That was the one.

279
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:11,683
Yeah.

280
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:13,670
Yeah.

281
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:16,520
Marto wrong time.

282
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,840
Shirley temple.

283
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,220
She's new at this duty any moment.

284
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,143
Crazy.

285
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:25,210
You really can't talk
like that on TV anymore.

286
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:27,130
People will wonder why
you're talking like that.

287
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:27,570
No,

288
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:28,403
I know.

289
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,590
But this was so,

290
00:07:29,591 --> 00:07:29,891
you know,

291
00:07:29,891 --> 00:07:32,220
this was way back an interesting though,

292
00:07:32,221 --> 00:07:34,180
that style of talking like there was like,

293
00:07:34,181 --> 00:07:38,740
it's a weird fake style of talking on
television back then that they just don't

294
00:07:38,741 --> 00:07:39,574
do anymore.

295
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,200
What an interesting show.

296
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:41,681
Yeah,

297
00:07:41,681 --> 00:07:42,850
it was very interesting.

298
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:44,650
So that was,

299
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:45,520
that was really,

300
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,120
you know,

301
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,410
that was a big strength of terror.

302
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:49,930
He was so articulate,

303
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:51,543
charismatic,

304
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:56,550
he was well educated and he could make
whatever he was talking about make sense

305
00:07:56,591 --> 00:07:59,170
even or sound like it was making sense.

306
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:01,150
Even limit it didn't,

307
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:03,331
well he,

308
00:08:03,331 --> 00:08:06,250
he had so many interesting ideas that uh,

309
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:08,320
opened up so many people to uh,

310
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:10,120
to new possibilities.

311
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,040
But there,

312
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,561
there were,

313
00:08:11,561 --> 00:08:13,690
it was most certainly a
few of them that were very,

314
00:08:13,691 --> 00:08:14,650
very controversial.

315
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:18,400
Timewave zero novelty
theory being a big one,

316
00:08:18,401 --> 00:08:22,720
which I tried to explain this to a
friend of mine once and just trying to

317
00:08:22,721 --> 00:08:23,620
explain it,

318
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,810
I sounded completely crazy.

319
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:26,641
I said,

320
00:08:26,641 --> 00:08:26,731
dude,

321
00:08:26,731 --> 00:08:28,060
it's a something.

322
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:33,190
He was trying to figure out how to
measure time through using the each thing,

323
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:38,430
which is an ancient Chinese method of
divination that somehow based on hexagrams

324
00:08:39,131 --> 00:08:40,930
and maybe a map of time,

325
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:45,400
and my friend looked at me like
I was out of my fucking mind.

326
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,061
And I'm like,

327
00:08:46,061 --> 00:08:46,181
well,

328
00:08:46,181 --> 00:08:47,740
the idea is that time is like a,

329
00:08:47,741 --> 00:08:49,340
an algorithm somehow or not.

330
00:08:49,341 --> 00:08:49,450
Right.

331
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:50,380
And you can track it,

332
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:51,190
right.

333
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:52,023
So are you,

334
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:52,271
do you,

335
00:08:52,271 --> 00:08:54,190
are you familiar with the chain?

336
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,070
Yes.

337
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:55,460
Yes.

338
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,250
So,

339
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:59,100
so that was the framework for this idea.

340
00:08:59,150 --> 00:08:59,451
And,

341
00:08:59,451 --> 00:09:00,600
and you know,

342
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,890
the time wave,

343
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:02,971
I mean,

344
00:09:02,971 --> 00:09:07,230
that's one area where we had
a very different perspective,

345
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:07,740
you know.

346
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:07,951
Uh,

347
00:09:07,951 --> 00:09:08,431
and,

348
00:09:08,431 --> 00:09:08,790
uh,

349
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:12,930
actually in the book I have a chapter
on the time wave and I kind of unpacked

350
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:17,340
the TimeWave and my own
perspective on it was that,

351
00:09:17,341 --> 00:09:18,174
uh,

352
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:19,590
you know,

353
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:20,423
he

354
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:26,280
postulated that the TimeWave
was an actual map of time.

355
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:27,060
Right.

356
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,520
And I think that's where
he overstepped the bounds.

357
00:09:29,521 --> 00:09:34,200
I think what really happened was he
rediscovered an ancient Chinese calendar.

358
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:35,400
You know,

359
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,160
that because you can use the
each thing as a calendar.

360
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,380
There's no doubt he's demonstrated that.

361
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:44,520
But if he rediscovered an ancient
Chinese calendar based on the chain,

362
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,800
that would have been remarkable.

363
00:09:46,801 --> 00:09:50,430
A few Chinese scholars would have
congratulated him and nobody would have,

364
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:51,060
you know,

365
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,500
notice neon that,

366
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,393
but then he,

367
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:54,001
he,

368
00:09:54,001 --> 00:09:54,630
you know,

369
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:59,630
sort of possibly this whole crazy notion
about time and about how time was a

370
00:10:01,321 --> 00:10:04,860
fractal structure of
made up of resonances.

371
00:10:04,861 --> 00:10:05,694
And anyway,

372
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:06,300
the,

373
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,170
the sort of,

374
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:08,281
you know,

375
00:10:08,281 --> 00:10:12,540
the thing of interest for most people
was that he had to postulate an end date

376
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:16,980
and he postulated several end dates,

377
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:17,341
you know,

378
00:10:17,341 --> 00:10:19,890
because the theory said it
had to have a beginning,

379
00:10:19,891 --> 00:10:20,550
a middle of it.

380
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,890
And he postulated several end dates.

381
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:27,600
But the one he finally
settled on was December 21st,

382
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:27,630
2012,

383
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:28,020
you know,

384
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:30,720
which was close enough.

385
00:10:30,721 --> 00:10:31,170
I mean,

386
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:31,471
I mean,

387
00:10:31,471 --> 00:10:36,471
he actually postulated an end date that
was slightly off that by some of them

388
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,810
remember November,

389
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,673
right?

390
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:42,720
So we're talking about a cycle,

391
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:43,950
billions of years,

392
00:10:43,951 --> 00:10:44,430
right?

393
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:49,310
So he looked at that and many found out
or already knew about the Mayan calendar

394
00:10:49,311 --> 00:10:49,711
and thought,

395
00:10:49,711 --> 00:10:49,981
well,

396
00:10:49,981 --> 00:10:50,860
they're close enough.

397
00:10:50,861 --> 00:10:52,980
Let's just sink these together.

398
00:10:52,981 --> 00:10:56,490
But there's no direct connection to
the Mayan calendar other than that.

399
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:00,210
But didn't he say that he arrived
at a completely independently

400
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:02,740
of the mind of the,

401
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:03,990
well,

402
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:04,811
the time date,

403
00:11:04,811 --> 00:11:06,220
he said that it was that like

404
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:14,040
a little factory here arrived at
a date that was close to that.

405
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:14,640
Right.

406
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,330
You know,

407
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:15,900
and then,

408
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:16,733
but,

409
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:17,850
but also,

410
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:18,330
uh,

411
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:19,163
you know,

412
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:20,550
during the time,

413
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:25,610
there were several times in the past
when he postulated and dates that,

414
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:26,490
you know,

415
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:26,970
we're,

416
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:29,280
I'm the time I wasn't
well known and there were,

417
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:29,820
you know,

418
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:30,930
it came and went,

419
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:35,990
nothing happened and he just viewed that
as part of the process of trying to,

420
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:36,900
uh,

421
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:37,320
to,

422
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:37,621
you know,

423
00:11:37,621 --> 00:11:40,050
fit this thing against history.

424
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:42,600
Did anybody go back and reexamine the,

425
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:46,140
each thing for the possibility of it
being a really effective ancient Chinese

426
00:11:46,141 --> 00:11:46,920
calendar?

427
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,310
Did,

428
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:49,580
has anybody looked at that aspect of it?

429
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:49,921
Well,

430
00:11:49,921 --> 00:11:52,440
no one to my knowledge except terros.

431
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:53,303
I mean if you,

432
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:55,480
if you just split that part out,

433
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,130
it's like it's out there though.

434
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:58,503
Well,

435
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,640
that he said that it's a calendar.

436
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:00,870
Well,

437
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:04,960
did Terrence believed it was like why
wouldn't someone want follow up on that?

438
00:12:04,961 --> 00:12:08,200
I mean that it let us forget
about the map of time thing,

439
00:12:08,201 --> 00:12:09,400
which is like really,

440
00:12:09,401 --> 00:12:10,360
really hard to follow.

441
00:12:10,361 --> 00:12:13,850
But just that aspect of it seems like
it would be worth looking into it.

442
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,570
It would be worth looking
into from scholarship.

443
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:16,900
Yeah,

444
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:17,531
definitely.

445
00:12:17,531 --> 00:12:17,771
I mean,

446
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:22,510
there's no doubt that
it is a perfect 384 day,

447
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:24,970
13 month lunar calendar.

448
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:25,331
I mean,

449
00:12:25,331 --> 00:12:30,331
it works very well as works as well as
any other calendrical system that we

450
00:12:30,941 --> 00:12:31,360
have.

451
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:31,750
You know,

452
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,583
they're all,

453
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,260
they all have inaccuracies.

454
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:36,543
Um,

455
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:37,421
you know,

456
00:12:37,421 --> 00:12:37,541
and,

457
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:39,160
and that alone is remarkable.

458
00:12:39,161 --> 00:12:39,911
And the fee,

459
00:12:39,911 --> 00:12:40,480
you know,

460
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,990
but he had this whole other theory and,

461
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:43,871
and you know,

462
00:12:43,871 --> 00:12:44,110
the,

463
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:44,943
the problem

464
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:48,880
that I have with the,

465
00:12:48,881 --> 00:12:50,740
with the time wave theory was that,

466
00:12:50,741 --> 00:12:51,574
um,

467
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,620
there was no way to quantify it.

468
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:55,330
This idea of novelty.

469
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:55,661
I mean,

470
00:12:55,661 --> 00:13:00,070
I believe novelty in
dresses into the continuum,

471
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,740
but it's hard to put a number on that.

472
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:03,111
I mean,

473
00:13:03,111 --> 00:13:03,251
it,

474
00:13:03,251 --> 00:13:08,200
just to look around novelty is ingressing
end of the continuum and it appears to

475
00:13:08,201 --> 00:13:09,550
be accelerating.

476
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:12,010
But maybe that's just our impression.

477
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:13,780
But this was his idea.

478
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:17,020
The question is how do
you define a novel event?

479
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:18,003
Right?

480
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:19,630
Our novel events,

481
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:20,081
I mean,

482
00:13:20,081 --> 00:13:20,430
he,

483
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:20,770
he,

484
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:25,770
he had the theory that novel advance
suddenly erupt into history and,

485
00:13:27,371 --> 00:13:27,641
uh,

486
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:28,030
you know,

487
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:28,930
make a change.

488
00:13:28,931 --> 00:13:31,510
And those kinds of events are really rare.

489
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,140
You know,

490
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:32,470
I mean,

491
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:33,790
asteroid impacts,

492
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:34,660
that kind of thing.

493
00:13:34,661 --> 00:13:35,050
Yeah,

494
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:37,870
those are abrupt novel events.

495
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,360
But he used to site,

496
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:41,260
for example,

497
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:42,670
you know,

498
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:45,940
the dropping of the bomb on Hiroshima,

499
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:46,900
you know,

500
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,040
I mean that was,

501
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,080
that had a huge impact on history.

502
00:13:50,081 --> 00:13:52,600
Everything after that time was different,

503
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:53,051
you know,

504
00:13:53,051 --> 00:13:54,160
it changed our lives.

505
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,570
But was it,

506
00:13:55,630 --> 00:14:00,140
was that the novel event or was it the
testing of the bomb and Alamogordo or

507
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:00,750
Wilson,

508
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:01,540
you know,

509
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:05,770
Einstein's discovery of the equations
that enabled this to be possible.

510
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,140
All those things were novel events,

511
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:11,500
which happened very quietly
and kind of unnoticed.

512
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:16,320
But if they hadn't happened this
spectacular thing over here,

513
00:14:16,321 --> 00:14:18,040
Ashima would not have happened either.

514
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:18,431
Right.

515
00:14:18,431 --> 00:14:19,264
So,

516
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,360
so my view of it was that novelty kind
of diffuses into history rather than the

517
00:14:24,881 --> 00:14:26,230
rocked into history.

518
00:14:26,231 --> 00:14:27,130
And pretty soon,

519
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,030
you know,

520
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:29,170
everything changes.

521
00:14:29,171 --> 00:14:34,171
But it changes over time and we're not
even subjectively aware of it that much.

522
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:39,040
What was his motivation to pursue that?

523
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:44,110
Like to pursue such a strange
and very hard to follow theory?

524
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:46,203
Well,

525
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:49,570
to pursue this timely theory?

526
00:14:49,571 --> 00:14:54,571
Well F two take splain that
we really have to go back to,

527
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:58,160
we should probably explain the TimeWave
too for people don't know what the hell

528
00:14:58,161 --> 00:14:58,994
we're talking about.

529
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,220
There might be people that are going,

530
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:02,810
what the fuck is the TimeWave Siri,

531
00:15:02,811 --> 00:15:03,141
right?

532
00:15:03,141 --> 00:15:03,351
Well,

533
00:15:03,351 --> 00:15:07,490
the time wave theory is
this mathematical construct,

534
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,180
you know,

535
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:13,180
based on the teaching that Terrence got
basically download it to him when we did

536
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:15,374
the,

537
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:19,700
what's it been famously known as
the experiment it lot sure era,

538
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:20,391
you know,

539
00:15:20,391 --> 00:15:22,730
which the book also talks about them,

540
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,050
which again,

541
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:24,830
a lot of PR,

542
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:26,420
if you're a Terence Mckenna Fan,

543
00:15:26,421 --> 00:15:27,650
you know what that is.

544
00:15:27,651 --> 00:15:28,460
If you're not,

545
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,470
you're wondering what the hell is this,

546
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:30,891
you know,

547
00:15:30,891 --> 00:15:31,700
so,

548
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,460
but the experiment that
lecturer was when we,

549
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:36,893
you know,

550
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,350
well how do we explain it?

551
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:42,290
I don't even know if we could
go into it on the podcast,

552
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:46,460
but it was something
that we attempted to do.

553
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:47,990
You know,

554
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,040
when we went to,

555
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:49,250
uh,

556
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:52,400
South America looking
for exotic hallucinogens,

557
00:15:52,401 --> 00:15:54,650
and this was in 1971.

558
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:55,941
And,

559
00:15:55,941 --> 00:15:56,390
uh,

560
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:59,780
we were motivated.

561
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,291
I mean,

562
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:02,690
I'm sort of getting off track here,

563
00:16:02,691 --> 00:16:05,660
but I'm trying to bring it back
to the issue of the TimeWave.

564
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:10,280
We were motivated to go in 1971,

565
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:14,360
basically by are interesting
in fascination with DMT.

566
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:19,290
I mean that was what got
us going because we had,

567
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:19,540
uh,

568
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:24,540
encountered DMT and the hate and in
Berkeley in the 60s it was very rare.

569
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:25,870
You know,

570
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:27,140
it's extremely not,

571
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:29,540
not on the streets or anything.

572
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:30,290
It was,

573
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:31,730
it was hard to come by,

574
00:16:31,731 --> 00:16:36,410
but we had come by it and had
the experience of it and thought,

575
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,150
holy Christ that,

576
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:38,780
you know,

577
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:43,780
there is nothing else more interesting
than this that we've ever encountered.

578
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:44,781
And so,

579
00:16:44,781 --> 00:16:45,140
you know,

580
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:50,140
we were involved in all the political
turmoil and the Anti Vietnam War movements

581
00:16:50,751 --> 00:16:51,650
and you know,

582
00:16:51,651 --> 00:16:53,480
free speech and all of that.

583
00:16:53,481 --> 00:16:54,980
Terrence was at Berkeley.

584
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,360
I wasn't particularly,

585
00:16:56,361 --> 00:16:56,700
but we,

586
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,533
we just thought,

587
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:58,663
you know,

588
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:00,380
none of that is relevant.

589
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:04,610
This is truly the most amazing
thing that we've ever encountered.

590
00:17:04,611 --> 00:17:05,181
And so,

591
00:17:05,181 --> 00:17:06,050
and so,

592
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:07,790
you know,

593
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:12,470
our original motivation to go to
South America was because the,

594
00:17:12,471 --> 00:17:16,340
as you know that the smoking
of Dmt is very short,

595
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:17,180
right?

596
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,320
It's 10 minutes,

597
00:17:18,321 --> 00:17:19,340
15 minutes,

598
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:21,770
and you'd come back and you're like,

599
00:17:21,771 --> 00:17:23,300
what the hell was that?

600
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:24,590
What the fuck was that?

601
00:17:24,591 --> 00:17:24,951
You know,

602
00:17:24,951 --> 00:17:25,271
you,

603
00:17:25,271 --> 00:17:29,810
you can't bring back much from it other
than just an overwhelming impression of

604
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,840
awe and amazement and that you've
looked into some other world that's more

605
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:38,720
bizarre than anything you've ever seen,

606
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,051
you know,

607
00:17:39,051 --> 00:17:39,884
encountered.

608
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:44,540
So we thought if we could
find an orally active form of,

609
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,190
of this DMT that we,

610
00:17:46,191 --> 00:17:47,330
it would last longer.

611
00:17:47,331 --> 00:17:48,770
That was a simple rationale.

612
00:17:48,771 --> 00:17:53,771
It would longer and we could kind of get
our sea legs there and figure out what

613
00:17:54,631 --> 00:17:55,350
was going on.

614
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:57,330
So hilarious expression for DMT,

615
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,131
get your sea legs,

616
00:17:58,131 --> 00:17:59,290
get your sea legs,

617
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:03,120
just spend a little more time.

618
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:03,720
And,

619
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:07,290
and so we read about this very obscure,

620
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:08,603
uh,

621
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:10,080
uh,

622
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:15,080
drug prepared from a species
of tree and South America.

623
00:18:15,571 --> 00:18:18,120
It was called Beralas and shelties,

624
00:18:18,121 --> 00:18:21,030
the famous ethnobotanist
from Harvard wrote about,

625
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,020
wrote,

626
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:26,730
published a paper in 1970 called Varroa
as an orally active hallucinate champ.

627
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:31,260
Right now for role is normally
used as a snuff in South America.

628
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:31,711
Right?

629
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:31,951
I mean,

630
00:18:31,951 --> 00:18:32,970
that's certain tribes,

631
00:18:32,971 --> 00:18:35,040
the Yanomamo and other tribes,

632
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:37,380
they extract the SAP,

633
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:39,780
they dry it down and they
make a snuff out of it.

634
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:43,890
But there were a couple of tribes
that made an oral preparation from it.

635
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:49,260
So that attracted our attention and we
decided to go to South America and look

636
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:50,094
for,

637
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:50,490
you know,

638
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:50,940
this,

639
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:55,940
this with toto drug called Uq
who hae or something like that.

640
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:56,881
Oh,

641
00:18:56,881 --> 00:18:57,211
cool.

642
00:18:57,211 --> 00:18:58,044
Hey,

643
00:18:58,050 --> 00:18:58,800
uh,

644
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:02,850
and it happened to be that
the ancestral home of the wit,

645
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:04,410
toto was at La Chorrera.

646
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:07,110
That's what led us to go
to La Chorrera originally.

647
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:07,560
Right.

648
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:12,560
Which the search for this drug that
no one ever heard of except us and our

649
00:19:13,371 --> 00:19:14,204
racial taste.

650
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,600
And uh,

651
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,620
so we went there looking for that.

652
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,700
And uh,

653
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,940
well at the time nobody
knew much about IOWASCA.

654
00:19:26,941 --> 00:19:30,690
I mean I Wasa is also an
orally active form of DMT,

655
00:19:30,691 --> 00:19:32,550
but we didn't know that at the time.

656
00:19:32,551 --> 00:19:33,770
And nobody did that.

657
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:36,060
Maybe we can talk about that later,

658
00:19:36,061 --> 00:19:37,170
but uh,

659
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:41,850
but we went looking for [inaudible]
right when we got to Letcher era,

660
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,680
we found that,

661
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:44,933
uh,

662
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:49,320
the mission village that we set up,

663
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:54,350
that we stayed at the mission
lodge Herrera had cleared
pastors all around about

664
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:59,840
a couple of hundred acres of pastures and
they brought say boot cattle into this

665
00:19:59,851 --> 00:20:00,391
place.

666
00:20:00,391 --> 00:20:01,980
The white humpback cattle.

667
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:02,700
Well,

668
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,510
the shit,

669
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:08,510
the Dung of this cattle is the preferred
substrate for psilocybe cubensis and it

670
00:20:10,171 --> 00:20:13,830
was a particularly rich year that year.

671
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:17,370
I mean the lots of rain missed
on the pasture and all that.

672
00:20:17,371 --> 00:20:21,930
So literally every cow pie had huge
clusters of psilocybin mushrooms,

673
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:22,830
uh,

674
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:23,101
you know,

675
00:20:23,101 --> 00:20:24,210
growing out of them.

676
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:24,780
All right.

677
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,670
And again,

678
00:20:26,671 --> 00:20:28,140
this was 1971.

679
00:20:28,141 --> 00:20:31,710
A lot of people hadn't had much
experience with psilocybin mushrooms,

680
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:36,420
but we knew from our references
let this mushroom was,

681
00:20:36,421 --> 00:20:36,960
we didn't,

682
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,130
we'd never taken it,

683
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:38,581
but we thought,

684
00:20:38,581 --> 00:20:38,971
great.

685
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:40,170
Psilocybin mushrooms,

686
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:42,900
wonderful s so we were delayed.

687
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:44,280
We were misled,

688
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:44,641
right?

689
00:20:44,641 --> 00:20:49,641
We thought that [inaudible] was the
real mystery that we were after.

690
00:20:49,961 --> 00:20:54,830
It turns out psilocybin mushrooms where
the real mystery and silicide than the

691
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:59,830
is in fact the perfect
orally active form of DMT,

692
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:00,281
right?

693
00:21:00,281 --> 00:21:01,300
The syllabus,

694
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:06,360
the active form of Psilocybin is just
one mile one Adam different from DMT and

695
00:21:07,961 --> 00:21:11,170
it's a perfectly engineered
for human metabolism.

696
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,710
It's nontoxic,

697
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:13,930
it's orally active,

698
00:21:13,931 --> 00:21:14,920
it's easily,

699
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:15,980
you know,

700
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:16,920
excrete it.

701
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,501
It's all,

702
00:21:17,501 --> 00:21:18,340
it's ideal.

703
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:19,420
It really is.

704
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,790
That's a perfect psychedelic in some ways.

705
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:22,624
So we thought,

706
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:26,380
but at the time we thought we were after.

707
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:26,820
Oh,

708
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:27,161
cool.

709
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:27,994
Hey.

710
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:28,961
So we thought,

711
00:21:28,961 --> 00:21:29,794
well,

712
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:31,001
okay,

713
00:21:31,001 --> 00:21:32,740
so these mushrooms are here,

714
00:21:32,741 --> 00:21:33,461
this is great.

715
00:21:33,461 --> 00:21:35,320
While we're waiting for the real mystery,

716
00:21:35,321 --> 00:21:37,000
we'll we can eat these mushrooms.

717
00:21:37,001 --> 00:21:41,860
When we started eating the mushrooms and
pretty soon and things got very weird,

718
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:42,730
you know,

719
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:45,640
because we were literally eating
them every day and they were,

720
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:46,570
they were,

721
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:47,403
uh,

722
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:53,080
we started having a lot of
very interesting conversations,

723
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:54,790
shall we say.

724
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,190
How many days did you do this for?

725
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:58,653
Oh,

726
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:00,881
well,

727
00:22:00,881 --> 00:22:01,540
you know,

728
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:01,900
uh,

729
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:02,350
I mean,

730
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:04,890
there wasn't that much to eat at lot.

731
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:05,230
Sure.

732
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:07,990
We had brought canned goods
and rice and things like that,

733
00:22:07,991 --> 00:22:12,250
but we found that it was very easy to
just kind of slip a few mushrooms into the

734
00:22:12,251 --> 00:22:12,731
soup.

735
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:13,091
You know,

736
00:22:13,091 --> 00:22:14,260
they didn't taste bad.

737
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,170
So probably for a week or 10 days or so,

738
00:22:17,171 --> 00:22:20,440
we were pretty much taking
mushrooms constantly.

739
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:21,220
Wow.

740
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:21,971
And,

741
00:22:21,971 --> 00:22:22,540
uh,

742
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:27,540
and it began to suggest this
experiment that we could do,

743
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:29,501
you know,

744
00:22:29,501 --> 00:22:30,370
if it began,

745
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:30,940
it,

746
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:31,773
it,

747
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:36,900
it the mushroom or the intelligence
that spoke through the mushroom,

748
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,460
you know,

749
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,810
it was never quite clear,

750
00:22:40,811 --> 00:22:41,890
but there was definitely,

751
00:22:41,891 --> 00:22:46,750
it was like having a very intelligent
guests at your party and you know,

752
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:47,860
you didn't see it,

753
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:49,900
but you definitely were in touch with it.

754
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:51,790
And it began to suggest this,

755
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,800
this experiment that we could do,

756
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:54,161
I mean,

757
00:22:54,161 --> 00:22:55,840
this wild experiment,

758
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:59,110
the experiment that lunch rare and uh,

759
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:01,563
uh,

760
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:03,863
we,

761
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:04,440
you know,

762
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,410
I don't know how much detail
you want to go into on this,

763
00:23:07,411 --> 00:23:07,830
but we,

764
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:12,060
we performed this experiment that the
trying to get it back to the Ching and the

765
00:23:12,061 --> 00:23:13,110
TimeWave thing.

766
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,030
We performed this experiment,

767
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:20,060
which was something like creating the
philosopher's stone essentially out of our

768
00:23:21,811 --> 00:23:26,811
own DNA and the DNA of a mushroom and
sound and light and singing to the

769
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:30,030
mushroom and coming up,

770
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:30,391
you know,

771
00:23:30,391 --> 00:23:33,960
creating these superconducting
residences and you know,

772
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:34,823
I mean,

773
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:36,130
okay,

774
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:36,990
crazy stuff.

775
00:23:36,991 --> 00:23:37,370
You can,

776
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:40,000
you can read the book,

777
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:40,391
you know,

778
00:23:40,391 --> 00:23:41,140
but it,

779
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,670
but we had this idea that,

780
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:44,350
that we could essentially,

781
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,260
I mean I guess I should
back up and explain it.

782
00:23:48,261 --> 00:23:53,261
We have this idea that the sounds
that you could hear on high doses of

783
00:23:53,871 --> 00:23:54,704
mushrooms.

784
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:56,990
I don't know if your experience with Dmt,

785
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:58,490
you hear things right.

786
00:23:58,491 --> 00:24:02,180
You often hear over tonal
sounds and the whole,

787
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:06,450
our old spaces as interesting as
the visual space in some ways.

788
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:09,920
Well on high doses of mushrooms
that's similar as well.

789
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:11,270
And you know,

790
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,980
if you listen to these sounds a,

791
00:24:12,981 --> 00:24:16,520
you can start to sort of
try to imitate them and uh,

792
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:16,881
you know,

793
00:24:16,881 --> 00:24:21,881
he can sing along with them or you can
vocalize along with them and the attempts

794
00:24:21,981 --> 00:24:24,020
to vocalize them or generally,

795
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:24,471
you know,

796
00:24:24,471 --> 00:24:26,090
not so good,

797
00:24:26,091 --> 00:24:27,140
they're hard to imitate,

798
00:24:27,141 --> 00:24:31,250
but you reach a certain point where you
just locked on to it and then it just

799
00:24:31,251 --> 00:24:36,251
pours out of you in a v
in a very powerful way.

800
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:37,700
And in a way that's,

801
00:24:37,701 --> 00:24:40,250
it's like almost being
possessed or something.

802
00:24:40,251 --> 00:24:40,521
This,

803
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:41,240
this,

804
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:44,660
this sound energy just pours forth.

805
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:50,170
So the mushrooms suggested to us a lot
of ideas about what these sounds were and

806
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:56,720
how they could actually set
up molecular resonances.

807
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:57,170
You know,

808
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:59,360
in our own brains,

809
00:24:59,361 --> 00:25:03,590
our own DNA and the DNA if a mushroom
and that we could essentially,

810
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:04,483
uh,

811
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:11,560
well create in some ways
create the ultimate object,

812
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:14,300
create the ultimate artifact,

813
00:25:14,301 --> 00:25:17,270
which would be our selves,

814
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:21,410
our own minds in an externalized form.

815
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:21,891
The,

816
00:25:21,891 --> 00:25:22,760
in a physical form,

817
00:25:22,761 --> 00:25:26,090
the interior was single form that
you could actually carry around.

818
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:30,080
It would be a binding of
space time and it would be,

819
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,630
I know this is crazy.

820
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,010
That is the highest you can get.

821
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,750
I think that's as high as a human can get.

822
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:38,210
Well there's no harm
could have this thing.

823
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:38,601
Well,

824
00:25:38,601 --> 00:25:41,230
so we had this theory about how to can,

825
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:41,690
how to,

826
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:43,340
how to uh,

827
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:44,150
you know,

828
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:45,890
induced this sound,

829
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:48,290
generate this object.

830
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:50,420
Not only generate this but,

831
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:53,030
but fix it like it Alchemy,

832
00:25:53,031 --> 00:25:54,300
you fixed mercury,

833
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:54,831
you know,

834
00:25:54,831 --> 00:25:59,060
I mean that's the final step of outcome
may cause this stuff was like mercury.

835
00:25:59,061 --> 00:26:00,320
This was like mines.

836
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:03,200
It was the violet psycho fluid.

837
00:26:03,201 --> 00:26:04,240
We called it c,

838
00:26:04,241 --> 00:26:04,880
you know,

839
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,440
this was a shared vision between the,

840
00:26:06,441 --> 00:26:11,441
both of you both have a shared
ideational vision in a certain sense.

841
00:26:12,141 --> 00:26:14,000
And so that wasn't coming to you.

842
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:17,600
It was the mushroom was uh,

843
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,051
you know,

844
00:26:18,051 --> 00:26:22,850
the mushroom or whoever was communicating
through the mushrooms was just matter

845
00:26:22,851 --> 00:26:26,420
of factly sort of wrapping this down.

846
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:27,200
And,

847
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,891
and you know,

848
00:26:27,891 --> 00:26:32,780
we were receptive to it and it was like
we're writing furiously and it's like we

849
00:26:32,781 --> 00:26:34,190
developed this experiment,

850
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,031
this idea,

851
00:26:35,031 --> 00:26:37,490
which had a whole lot of predictions.

852
00:26:37,491 --> 00:26:39,620
I mean crazy predictions that yeah,

853
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:42,020
you would actually have
at the end of the day,

854
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:45,000
you would have at night more accurately,

855
00:26:45,001 --> 00:26:48,120
you would have a physical
object that would,

856
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,290
you know,

857
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:51,000
would be outside the body,

858
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:52,440
but it would be you

859
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:54,803
and it would be like,

860
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:58,170
and it turns out there's all
sorts of precedent for this,

861
00:26:58,171 --> 00:26:58,590
right?

862
00:26:58,590 --> 00:26:58,891
I mean,

863
00:26:58,891 --> 00:27:01,410
the idea of the outcomist stone,

864
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:05,070
the philosopher's stone
or the time machine,

865
00:27:05,071 --> 00:27:06,570
the flying saucers,

866
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:07,440
the,

867
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:07,951
you know,

868
00:27:07,951 --> 00:27:10,560
the outcome is scrying mirror,

869
00:27:10,561 --> 00:27:10,891
you know,

870
00:27:10,891 --> 00:27:13,470
that you can look into and see the future.

871
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:18,530
I mean this idea haunts the human
imagination that there is a way you can

872
00:27:20,191 --> 00:27:24,900
externalize the imagination and you know,

873
00:27:24,901 --> 00:27:26,040
still be it.

874
00:27:26,041 --> 00:27:29,430
And this thing that you would
have or whatever it was,

875
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:34,710
would be responsive to your imagination
and it would be able to do literally

876
00:27:34,711 --> 00:27:39,690
whatever you could imagine that song
that's sort of an alternate theory on Ufos

877
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:40,980
isn't as well that you're,

878
00:27:40,981 --> 00:27:45,810
you're the imagination actually can
conjure up a physical object and even,

879
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:46,231
yeah,

880
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:46,841
exactly.

881
00:27:46,841 --> 00:27:47,010
Yeah,

882
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:47,671
exactly.

883
00:27:47,671 --> 00:27:48,660
That's what we're saying.

884
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,660
And even young speculated about that.

885
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:52,523
That's right.

886
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,573
So,

887
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,090
you know,

888
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:54,451
I mean,

889
00:27:54,451 --> 00:27:56,940
I know this sounds crazy 40 years later,

890
00:27:56,941 --> 00:27:59,820
if it sounds crazy to me too,

891
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:02,010
but at the time,

892
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:04,290
and it's like this is what's going down.

893
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,333
Right?

894
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,720
And you both agreed to it.

895
00:28:06,721 --> 00:28:07,950
That's what's even crazier.

896
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:12,540
He two and then we made predictions about
what would happen right at when we did

897
00:28:12,541 --> 00:28:13,410
this experiment.

898
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,820
This is what will happen.

899
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:20,510
And the predictions were such that
they couldn't possibly happen because,

900
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:21,900
you know,

901
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,070
this is absurd.

902
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,900
You can't create camp,

903
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,270
externalize the mind in this way.

904
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:32,100
But we made predictions and
when those didn't happen,

905
00:28:32,101 --> 00:28:34,470
a bunch of other
interesting things happen.

906
00:28:34,471 --> 00:28:38,790
Instead we had literally painted
ourselves into conceptual corner where

907
00:28:38,791 --> 00:28:40,890
something happened to had to give.

908
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:46,280
And so we both went into a prolonged
altered state for like 14 days.

909
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:51,450
I was smeared across the cosmos.

910
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,313
Literally,

911
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:53,240
you know,

912
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:53,561
I,

913
00:28:53,561 --> 00:28:54,600
I was,

914
00:28:54,601 --> 00:28:59,601
I hearkened back to a recent period when
I'd smoked DMT and my entire mind was

915
00:29:01,561 --> 00:29:03,150
coke contiguous with the,

916
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:04,140
you know,

917
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,890
boundaries of space time.

918
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:10,920
And Terrence became extreme know
he became complimentary to that.

919
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:15,920
He became extremely hyper vigilant
and a very focused on our place.

920
00:29:19,951 --> 00:29:21,810
And being like the anchor,

921
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,880
like if I was out there in the cosmos,

922
00:29:23,881 --> 00:29:28,881
he was the beacon that was bringing
me home and our companions,

923
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:34,140
these poor people thought
that we were completely nuts,

924
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:34,830
you know?

925
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:37,520
And they were not participated.

926
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,553
The locals?

927
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:39,031
No,

928
00:29:39,031 --> 00:29:39,391
no.

929
00:29:39,391 --> 00:29:44,391
The two people that we'd gone where it
was like they had stepped back from it.

930
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,780
So they were so earlier.

931
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:46,961
Oh,

932
00:29:46,961 --> 00:29:47,794
well yeah.

933
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:49,060
Oh,

934
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,680
that must've been so we were like,

935
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:51,221
oh,

936
00:29:51,221 --> 00:29:52,690
it was very strange for them.

937
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:55,750
I'm sure she is too strange for us,

938
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:59,650
but we were making sense to each other.

939
00:29:59,651 --> 00:30:04,480
There's actually a term in this
for a psychology in psychology.

940
00:30:04,481 --> 00:30:05,980
It's called the Folia do.

941
00:30:05,981 --> 00:30:06,814
It's the,

942
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,580
it's the,

943
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:10,120
the folly of two simultaneous,

944
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,440
you know,

945
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,210
psychosis essentially.

946
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:15,190
But it wasn't a psychosis.

947
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:17,080
That's the thing people
have to understand.

948
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,460
It wasn't a psychosis.

949
00:30:18,461 --> 00:30:19,121
If anything,

950
00:30:19,121 --> 00:30:23,560
it was closer to a shamonic initiation.

951
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:24,041
I mean,

952
00:30:24,041 --> 00:30:29,041
the motifs of shamanic initiation more
than the motifs of psychosis fit what

953
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:31,270
went on.

954
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:36,220
We were transformed and we were
transformed in a complimentary way.

955
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:41,020
And we also reintegrated more or less,

956
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:41,650
uh,

957
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:41,981
you know,

958
00:30:41,981 --> 00:30:42,610
so that,

959
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:43,443
I mean,

960
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:45,160
I'm fairly functional now.

961
00:30:45,161 --> 00:30:47,830
I don't know that I've
ever totally reintegrated,

962
00:30:47,831 --> 00:30:48,820
but you know what I mean?

963
00:30:48,821 --> 00:30:53,821
It wasn't a shamonic initiations where
you go through this metamorphosis and

964
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:58,450
things are done to you and you're
torn apart and year changed,

965
00:30:58,451 --> 00:31:01,510
but then you're put back
together in a different form.

966
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:02,480
And,

967
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,850
and that's really what happened.

968
00:31:03,851 --> 00:31:06,400
But I wasn't put back together as the,

969
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:07,530
you know,

970
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:09,040
super conducting,

971
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:09,670
uh,

972
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:10,503
you know,

973
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:16,500
bionic creature with access to all
information and all space and time that

974
00:31:17,231 --> 00:31:18,190
didn't happen.

975
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:19,563
Uh,

976
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:19,990
you know,

977
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:20,231
and,

978
00:31:20,231 --> 00:31:25,231
and so to try to bring this
around to whether the TimeWave,

979
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:31,480
the TimeWave came about
because Terrence was,

980
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:31,960
you know,

981
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:36,850
in this hypervigilant state where
he didn't sleep for 14 days,

982
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:37,690
you know,

983
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:41,410
he was watching over me for one thing,

984
00:31:41,411 --> 00:31:43,880
cause I tended to wander off and you know,

985
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,840
I was completely three sheets to the wind,

986
00:31:46,841 --> 00:31:47,674
literally,

987
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:48,121
you know,

988
00:31:48,121 --> 00:31:48,380
and,

989
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,300
and often this,

990
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,980
this cosmic fantasy world,

991
00:31:50,981 --> 00:31:52,840
but he was very focused,

992
00:31:52,841 --> 00:31:54,820
but he started making,

993
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,713
um,

994
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,810
making charts of time.

995
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,720
He was trying to predict.

996
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:07,900
We had done this experiment and we had
predicted that the stone would can dance

997
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:09,370
in this physical form.

998
00:32:09,371 --> 00:32:10,780
And at the end of the experiment,

999
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:11,950
that didn't happen.

1000
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,590
But we were getting the message that

1001
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:17,470
we did everything right.

1002
00:32:17,471 --> 00:32:22,471
It's just your timing that's
off and it will come right.

1003
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:25,510
The stone will condense at some points.

1004
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:30,540
But so it became this whole game sort
of of trying to predict when will the

1005
00:32:31,031 --> 00:32:32,380
stone can dance.

1006
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:36,250
And so Terrence begin charting our course,

1007
00:32:36,251 --> 00:32:36,581
you know,

1008
00:32:36,581 --> 00:32:36,910
and he,

1009
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:39,070
he found like he was,

1010
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:42,140
he counted back 64 days,

1011
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:44,600
two types of 64 days to the,

1012
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:46,250
to the,

1013
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:46,970
uh,

1014
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:47,301
you know,

1015
00:32:47,301 --> 00:32:48,740
from the date of the experiment.

1016
00:32:48,741 --> 00:32:53,420
And it turns out that was the date of
our mother's death the previous October.

1017
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:54,260
Right?

1018
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:56,780
And then he started counting
forward from that date,

1019
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:58,760
several cycles of 64.

1020
00:32:58,761 --> 00:33:02,060
And it turned out that
was his birthday in 1971.

1021
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:07,060
So that became a sort of focus for
predicting when it would condense.

1022
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,600
That course came and went.

1023
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:13,220
So over the years,

1024
00:33:13,221 --> 00:33:14,930
he tried to

1025
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,090
find,

1026
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:17,451
I guess,

1027
00:33:17,451 --> 00:33:19,310
fine tune this prediction,

1028
00:33:19,311 --> 00:33:20,360
fine tune this.

1029
00:33:20,361 --> 00:33:24,470
And that's what the whole elaborate
TimeWave theory grew out of.

1030
00:33:24,471 --> 00:33:25,220
You know,

1031
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:25,550
if,

1032
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:30,550
if there was an alien artifact that
was given to us by this experiment,

1033
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:33,020
then it was this,

1034
00:33:33,021 --> 00:33:35,570
it was this mathematical construction,

1035
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:36,560
you know,

1036
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,390
which wasn't given to me.

1037
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:39,440
It was given to him.

1038
00:33:39,441 --> 00:33:40,850
What was given to me were,

1039
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:42,103
uh,

1040
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,260
you know,

1041
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:43,490
uh,

1042
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:44,630
I mean the experience,

1043
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:44,820
uh,

1044
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:45,230
of,

1045
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:45,860
of,

1046
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:46,693
you know,

1047
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:51,140
being smeared over the cosmos and
then gradually over 14 days basically

1048
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:56,210
condensing myself back
into a body and eating.

1049
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:57,463
Was I eating?

1050
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:58,160
Uh,

1051
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:58,940
I don't know.

1052
00:33:58,940 --> 00:33:59,773
Uh,

1053
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:02,330
I guess somebody was feeding me.

1054
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:02,811
I mean,

1055
00:34:02,811 --> 00:34:04,190
I wasn't doing those things.

1056
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:04,351
Uh,

1057
00:34:04,351 --> 00:34:04,910
it was,

1058
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:07,640
it was someone must've fed me.

1059
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,230
Do you remember going to the bathroom?

1060
00:34:09,231 --> 00:34:09,770
Do you remember?

1061
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:10,341
I don't,

1062
00:34:10,341 --> 00:34:11,031
but you know what?

1063
00:34:11,031 --> 00:34:13,940
I remember I remembered
that I was in hyperspace.

1064
00:34:13,941 --> 00:34:15,890
I was coke contiguous.

1065
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,330
Uh,

1066
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:20,480
I shared topology with everyone.

1067
00:34:20,481 --> 00:34:24,080
So if I wanted to take a shit,

1068
00:34:24,081 --> 00:34:25,010
for example,

1069
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,800
I would ask my friend to take a shit.

1070
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:30,560
Wow.

1071
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,131
I could,

1072
00:34:31,131 --> 00:34:31,581
you know,

1073
00:34:31,581 --> 00:34:31,861
and the,

1074
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:35,810
and I could eliminate that
way because our typologies,

1075
00:34:35,811 --> 00:34:36,501
we're joined.

1076
00:34:36,501 --> 00:34:37,370
Or you know,

1077
00:34:37,371 --> 00:34:39,170
if I wanted to smoke a cigarette,

1078
00:34:39,171 --> 00:34:43,900
I'd ask Vanessa to smoke a
cigarette and I could all,

1079
00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:45,180
all those kind of crazy,

1080
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:46,460
just like a cigarette for you,

1081
00:34:46,461 --> 00:34:47,294
please.

1082
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:49,843
Right.

1083
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:52,330
I mean,

1084
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:53,670
I know this sounds crazy,

1085
00:34:53,671 --> 00:34:55,360
I shouldn't even be talking about,

1086
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:55,740
no,

1087
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:57,240
you should public.

1088
00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:03,770
Do you subscribe to the idea that like
these ancient cultures like the Mayans

1089
00:35:04,531 --> 00:35:04,890
and,

1090
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:05,400
uh,

1091
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:05,971
these,

1092
00:35:05,971 --> 00:35:10,200
these people that have these incredible
structures that are very likely this was

1093
00:35:10,201 --> 00:35:13,110
suicide and induced or their
culture was so Simon induced?

1094
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:13,451
Well,

1095
00:35:13,451 --> 00:35:13,660
I,

1096
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:14,021
yeah,

1097
00:35:14,021 --> 00:35:14,531
I do.

1098
00:35:14,531 --> 00:35:17,890
I think there's a good
chance that it was a,

1099
00:35:17,891 --> 00:35:18,191
I mean,

1100
00:35:18,191 --> 00:35:20,030
I think that that wasn't the only,

1101
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:24,910
that certainly wasn't the only name in
theologian that the Mayans knew about,

1102
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,500
but that was an important one.

1103
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:27,610
What else should they know about?

1104
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:28,001
Well,

1105
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:28,710
they knew,

1106
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:29,710
they knew about it a lot.

1107
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:30,544
They do about,

1108
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:31,120
you know,

1109
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:34,240
they knew about all the
Central American ones,

1110
00:35:34,241 --> 00:35:35,290
the morning glories,

1111
00:35:35,291 --> 00:35:35,611
Olo,

1112
00:35:35,611 --> 00:35:36,371
leaky,

1113
00:35:36,371 --> 00:35:37,150
the,

1114
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:37,560
you know,

1115
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,700
probably Salvia,

1116
00:35:38,701 --> 00:35:40,350
probably all of those.

1117
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:43,470
But the Mayans definitely
knew about mushrooms.

1118
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:43,950
And,

1119
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:44,783
uh,

1120
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:47,460
I think it's likely that mushrooms,

1121
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:48,690
you know,

1122
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:49,951
I mean,

1123
00:35:49,951 --> 00:35:50,171
if,

1124
00:35:50,171 --> 00:35:50,640
if you,

1125
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,010
if you talk about the stoned ape theory,

1126
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:53,461
you know,

1127
00:35:53,461 --> 00:35:53,581
it's,

1128
00:35:53,581 --> 00:35:54,391
you've talked about,

1129
00:35:54,391 --> 00:35:55,590
and Terrence is talked about,

1130
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,020
it's most likely mushrooms,

1131
00:35:58,110 --> 00:35:58,710
you know,

1132
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:02,730
that because mushrooms are pan global,

1133
00:36:02,731 --> 00:36:03,990
they're found in every,

1134
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,100
every climate,

1135
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:05,731
you know,

1136
00:36:05,731 --> 00:36:06,870
if it's tropics,

1137
00:36:06,871 --> 00:36:07,590
it's stiff.

1138
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:08,011
It's,

1139
00:36:08,011 --> 00:36:10,120
I lost Sufi cubensis if it's temporary,

1140
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:12,660
it's so lots to be semi Ilan Siada.

1141
00:36:12,661 --> 00:36:14,460
But these things are all over the place.

1142
00:36:14,461 --> 00:36:15,450
They're potent.

1143
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:18,390
They don't require any preparation,

1144
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:18,810
right?

1145
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:23,250
No technology needed other than
the curiosity to bend over,

1146
00:36:23,251 --> 00:36:27,030
pick it up and munch and you know,

1147
00:36:27,031 --> 00:36:28,350
and once you do that,

1148
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,970
then the impact,

1149
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,790
it had to be profound.

1150
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:33,360
You know?

1151
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:33,611
And,

1152
00:36:33,611 --> 00:36:33,911
and,

1153
00:36:33,911 --> 00:36:38,220
and we're talking about omnivorous
primates here who are hungry all the time,

1154
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:42,420
very acutely keyed into their environment.

1155
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:42,781
I mean,

1156
00:36:42,781 --> 00:36:45,090
it's not like they're
going to overlook things,

1157
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:46,230
right?

1158
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:48,660
So they'll see it and they'll eat it,

1159
00:36:48,661 --> 00:36:49,290
test things.

1160
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,630
And they are exactly,

1161
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,220
exactly.

1162
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:51,550
They,

1163
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:53,790
they're omnivores and they test things.

1164
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:57,100
And so they test this
and then they get the,

1165
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,740
the message,

1166
00:36:59,030 --> 00:36:59,580
you know,

1167
00:36:59,580 --> 00:36:59,841
and I,

1168
00:36:59,841 --> 00:37:00,720
I think that,

1169
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:01,140
uh,

1170
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:01,973
you know,

1171
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:04,100
I mean,

1172
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,470
and the stoned ape theory there,

1173
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:08,130
there are things that are
puzzling to me that I,

1174
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:11,400
I totally don't completely understand.

1175
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,000
It's like,

1176
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,241
you know,

1177
00:37:12,241 --> 00:37:13,200
we were near,

1178
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:14,063
you know,

1179
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:14,910
if you,

1180
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:19,910
if you look at the archeological
evidence for the critical period when

1181
00:37:20,881 --> 00:37:23,430
consciousness emerged in our species,

1182
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:29,990
except for a couple of indications that
go way back like half a million years,

1183
00:37:30,061 --> 00:37:30,390
but,

1184
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:30,950
but,

1185
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:31,050
uh,

1186
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:31,441
you know,

1187
00:37:31,441 --> 00:37:33,990
the efflorescence of artistic expression,

1188
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:39,080
which is really the only way you can
tell happened sometime between a hundred

1189
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:41,100
thousand years ago and 8,000 years ago.

1190
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:41,521
You know,

1191
00:37:41,521 --> 00:37:45,720
you look at the cave paintings
and some of the oldest ones,

1192
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:50,130
the Blombos cave in South
Africa goes 80,000 years.

1193
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:51,570
That was clearly,

1194
00:37:51,571 --> 00:37:56,550
those artifacts were clearly done by
conscious beings within artistic sense.

1195
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,360
You know,

1196
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:00,330
so if that equates to cognition,

1197
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:02,570
but then the,

1198
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,270
the,

1199
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:03,930
you know,

1200
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:08,580
then clearly consciousness was happening,

1201
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:09,300
you know,

1202
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:12,810
somewhere after a hundred thousand years,

1203
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,460
up until now,

1204
00:38:14,461 --> 00:38:15,330
presumably,

1205
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:16,560
you know,

1206
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,820
consciousness was happening.

1207
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:20,160
But if you look at the fossil record,

1208
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:25,470
the neurologically modern
brain was much older than that,

1209
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:26,551
you know,

1210
00:38:26,551 --> 00:38:27,000
I mean,

1211
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:27,833
essentially,

1212
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,520
you know,

1213
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,920
at least a hundred thousand,

1214
00:38:31,921 --> 00:38:34,920
maybe 200,000 years older
than this emergence of,

1215
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:36,091
you know,

1216
00:38:36,091 --> 00:38:40,980
the neurologically modern brain with
all the apparatus needed to generate

1217
00:38:40,981 --> 00:38:41,814
language,

1218
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:42,180
right?

1219
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:44,820
And it's all about language and it's about

1220
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:50,160
this making this connection between sound,

1221
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:51,870
image and symbol,

1222
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:52,411
you know,

1223
00:38:52,411 --> 00:38:53,550
meaningful symbol.

1224
00:38:53,551 --> 00:38:53,740
And,

1225
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:55,290
and I've argued in,

1226
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,153
uh,

1227
00:38:56,490 --> 00:38:58,020
a lot of lectures and so on.

1228
00:38:58,021 --> 00:38:58,291
I mean,

1229
00:38:58,291 --> 00:38:59,190
my shtick,

1230
00:38:59,191 --> 00:38:59,851
if you will,

1231
00:38:59,851 --> 00:39:04,020
that what this is what this
amounts to is synesthesia,

1232
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:04,920
right?

1233
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,090
Synesthesia.

1234
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:09,990
It'd be in the translation of
one sensory mode to another.

1235
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:11,070
Well,

1236
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:13,050
like psychedelics do,

1237
00:39:13,051 --> 00:39:13,440
right?

1238
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:18,440
Psychedelics reliably induced synesthesia
where you can hear colors and see

1239
00:39:19,471 --> 00:39:20,161
sounds,

1240
00:39:20,161 --> 00:39:22,770
that's the most reveal aspect of it.

1241
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:23,940
Um,

1242
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:26,610
most people can't do that
without psychedelics,

1243
00:39:26,611 --> 00:39:27,630
but some cam,

1244
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:28,740
some are genetic,

1245
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,170
some people are genetically synesthetic.

1246
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:36,810
And their experience of
meaning and language is a,

1247
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:37,920
is very different.

1248
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:39,330
Uh,

1249
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:44,330
it's interesting that synesthesia in
genetically synesthetic people is often

1250
00:39:45,301 --> 00:39:48,540
associated with languages
and language and number,

1251
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:49,350
you know,

1252
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:53,250
so they'll say crazy sounding stuff like,

1253
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:54,000
you know,

1254
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,960
the letter c is hard and chrome color,

1255
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,070
you know,

1256
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:01,320
and they're think they're
speaking in the abstract,

1257
00:40:01,321 --> 00:40:02,154
but this is a,

1258
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:02,700
uh,

1259
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,670
an actual perception for them or you know,

1260
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:05,990
the,

1261
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:06,360
the,

1262
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:10,860
they'll talk about the
personality of the number nine.

1263
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:12,803
Whoa.

1264
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:15,210
Now these functional,

1265
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:15,700
these kinds of,

1266
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:16,533
some therapy,

1267
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:17,910
many of them are brilliant.

1268
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:18,391
Yes.

1269
00:40:18,391 --> 00:40:19,650
They're totally functional.

1270
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:23,310
So they're seeing all this
around them all the time,

1271
00:40:23,311 --> 00:40:26,190
but they can still manage
the way to move through it.

1272
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:29,280
So they're essentially walking
through a living mushroom trip.

1273
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:30,721
Yeah,

1274
00:40:30,721 --> 00:40:31,890
kind of in a sense.

1275
00:40:31,891 --> 00:40:32,340
I mean,

1276
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:37,340
I think they are aware of their
sort of cognitive environment,

1277
00:40:37,831 --> 00:40:39,120
if you want to put it that way.

1278
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:40,413
Uh,

1279
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,513
uh,

1280
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:42,930
the one,

1281
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:44,490
the same one that we inhabit,

1282
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:47,520
but a lot of this stuff goes
into the background for us.

1283
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:47,910
Right.

1284
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:52,350
And less we take a psychedelic
or something like that
and then it comes out into

1285
00:40:52,351 --> 00:40:53,184
the foreground.

1286
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:57,420
It goes on in the background that
that's essentially what I'm saying,

1287
00:40:57,421 --> 00:41:02,421
the process of understanding language is
this process of synesthesia that we're

1288
00:41:02,941 --> 00:41:04,440
not even aware of.

1289
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:04,830
Right?

1290
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:05,700
Where we have,

1291
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,290
we live in,

1292
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:12,440
we live in a world in which abstractions
and symbols are as real as you know,

1293
00:41:14,791 --> 00:41:16,620
anything in the outside world.

1294
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:17,340
Right?

1295
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:22,340
And we live in a world in which symbols
have significance and that is the basis

1296
00:41:23,041 --> 00:41:23,791
of language.

1297
00:41:23,791 --> 00:41:27,240
We are our ability to perceive meaning.

1298
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:28,920
Uh,

1299
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:33,920
and it's based on this sort of unconscious
synesthesia which we do all the time.

1300
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,610
And uh,

1301
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:43,020
mushrooms may,

1302
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:43,830
I mean,

1303
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:46,230
with respect to the evolution
of the primate brain,

1304
00:41:46,231 --> 00:41:46,800
I what I,

1305
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,710
what I think I'm postulating that,

1306
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:49,560
you know,

1307
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,000
something like mushrooms,

1308
00:41:51,001 --> 00:41:56,001
we're able to trigger these types of
synesthetic experiences it people and they

1309
00:41:57,601 --> 00:42:01,500
essentially became training
tools for learning cognition,

1310
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:03,750
training tools for learning.

1311
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:04,141
You know,

1312
00:42:04,141 --> 00:42:09,141
how to associate meaning with meaningless
sounds and essentially meaningless

1313
00:42:10,651 --> 00:42:11,191
symbols,

1314
00:42:11,191 --> 00:42:14,910
meaningless visual cues and oral cues.

1315
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:19,350
But it made the essential
connection to significance,

1316
00:42:19,351 --> 00:42:20,650
the feeling of significance.

1317
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:21,020
It's,

1318
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:21,853
you know,

1319
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:23,150
am I making any sense?

1320
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:23,480
Yes,

1321
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,041
absolutely.

1322
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:29,041
So that's the mechanism involved
of taking an intelligent thinking,

1323
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:32,120
lower primate and turning
it into a human being.

1324
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:32,660
Right,

1325
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:33,493
exactly.

1326
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:34,683
One they,

1327
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:36,590
and give it a lot of mushrooms
and see what happens.

1328
00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:37,923
Well,

1329
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:40,410
yes,

1330
00:42:40,410 --> 00:42:41,020
of course.

1331
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:41,561
My God,

1332
00:42:41,561 --> 00:42:42,800
that's all I want to do.

1333
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:44,380
Right.

1334
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:46,810
I just feel like there's
gotta be something to that.

1335
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:47,290
Right.

1336
00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:49,000
But it doesn't happen abruptly.

1337
00:42:49,001 --> 00:42:50,440
It's happens over time,

1338
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:50,990
right?

1339
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:52,510
Just have a whole farm.

1340
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:53,410
Well,

1341
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:54,030
yeah,

1342
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:54,370
but Shannon,

1343
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:55,001
but again,

1344
00:42:55,001 --> 00:42:56,800
I mean there are other things going on.

1345
00:42:56,801 --> 00:42:57,634
There are,

1346
00:42:57,790 --> 00:42:58,870
there are,

1347
00:42:58,900 --> 00:42:59,733
you know,

1348
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:02,440
I don't know if it said
climatological factors,

1349
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,850
criminological factors,

1350
00:43:03,851 --> 00:43:06,100
maternal inheritance factors,

1351
00:43:06,101 --> 00:43:06,461
you know,

1352
00:43:06,461 --> 00:43:06,701
I mean,

1353
00:43:06,701 --> 00:43:08,740
this is a whole other area of,

1354
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:09,321
we do,

1355
00:43:09,321 --> 00:43:09,750
you know,

1356
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:09,990
really

1357
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:14,370
described the theory for people that
don't know what the higher primate theory

1358
00:43:14,371 --> 00:43:14,701
is,

1359
00:43:14,701 --> 00:43:15,271
or excuse me,

1360
00:43:15,271 --> 00:43:15,470
the,

1361
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:16,140
um,

1362
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:16,531
that's my,

1363
00:43:16,531 --> 00:43:16,920
uh,

1364
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:17,790
that's his tee shirt here.

1365
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:18,481
The,

1366
00:43:18,481 --> 00:43:19,220
um,

1367
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:24,220
the stoned ape theory is that siliciden
mushrooms or psychedelic mushrooms were

1368
00:43:24,931 --> 00:43:27,540
responsible for creating human beings.

1369
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:30,720
And the one of Terrence's
assertions was that,

1370
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:31,770
uh,

1371
00:43:31,770 --> 00:43:32,131
the,

1372
00:43:32,131 --> 00:43:34,200
the doubling of the human brain size,

1373
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:36,510
it occurred over a period
of about 2 million years.

1374
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:42,010
And that this correlates
to the timeline of,

1375
00:43:42,011 --> 00:43:42,330
uh,

1376
00:43:42,330 --> 00:43:42,781
these,

1377
00:43:42,781 --> 00:43:43,280
uh,

1378
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,240
rain forest receding into grasslands.

1379
00:43:45,241 --> 00:43:47,320
And then these monkey,

1380
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:47,950
you know,

1381
00:43:47,950 --> 00:43:48,680
the apes,

1382
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:48,771
uh,

1383
00:43:48,771 --> 00:43:50,940
experimenting with different
food sources that does,

1384
00:43:50,941 --> 00:43:51,180
that.

1385
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:55,590
Does that stuff all jive with like core
samples and like climate studies and

1386
00:43:55,830 --> 00:44:00,300
cause all that stuff the same time with
the human brains has doubled is at all

1387
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,313
legit?

1388
00:44:01,590 --> 00:44:01,921
Well,

1389
00:44:01,921 --> 00:44:02,500
yeah,

1390
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:03,690
it's pretty much legit.

1391
00:44:03,691 --> 00:44:03,961
I mean,

1392
00:44:03,961 --> 00:44:05,100
we know that there were,

1393
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:06,153
you know,

1394
00:44:06,330 --> 00:44:09,930
I don't think you could put your finger
on any one factor and say this was

1395
00:44:09,931 --> 00:44:12,870
responsible for the
expansion of the human brain,

1396
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:17,900
but definitely the transition from
our boreal to to plain type existence

1397
00:44:21,361 --> 00:44:22,950
existence on the Serengeti,

1398
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:23,910
uh,

1399
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:28,800
was a time of incredible
environmental stress for these,

1400
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:32,130
for these primates and
the whole environment.

1401
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:34,680
They had to adapt and they had to,

1402
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:36,330
you know,

1403
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:38,400
learn a hold of diet,

1404
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:40,320
a whole new mode of existence.

1405
00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:42,270
And it's not clear at the timeframe that,

1406
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,040
that this took place over.

1407
00:44:44,370 --> 00:44:44,711
But I,

1408
00:44:44,711 --> 00:44:45,600
I think that,

1409
00:44:45,601 --> 00:44:46,434
uh,

1410
00:44:46,690 --> 00:44:46,940
and,

1411
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:47,520
and it's,

1412
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,670
and it's not clear how
much of it just happen.

1413
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:51,091
I mean,

1414
00:44:51,091 --> 00:44:54,000
it's not clear that this
necessarily triggered consciousness,

1415
00:44:54,001 --> 00:44:57,240
but it certainly triggered adaptations,

1416
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:57,720
uh,

1417
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:58,051
in,

1418
00:44:58,051 --> 00:44:59,850
in these primates that,

1419
00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:00,301
you know,

1420
00:45:00,301 --> 00:45:00,660
they were,

1421
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:05,660
they were forced into so that
perhaps got them ready when the time,

1422
00:45:05,671 --> 00:45:06,060
Kay,

1423
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:06,361
it's,

1424
00:45:06,361 --> 00:45:07,194
it's,

1425
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:07,651
I mean,

1426
00:45:07,651 --> 00:45:11,910
that's the part that's difficult
to predict or nail down.

1427
00:45:11,911 --> 00:45:13,350
How long,

1428
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:17,460
how far back were these mushrooms used?

1429
00:45:17,490 --> 00:45:17,941
You know,

1430
00:45:17,941 --> 00:45:22,941
was it a transient thing
or did the climate change,

1431
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:24,931
you know,

1432
00:45:24,931 --> 00:45:25,111
there,

1433
00:45:25,111 --> 00:45:28,980
was there a point around a
hundred thousand years ago
where the climate in that

1434
00:45:28,981 --> 00:45:32,670
area got much wetter and suddenly
these things became more,

1435
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:33,000
uh,

1436
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:33,990
more common,

1437
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:37,050
or were they always there and you know,

1438
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:37,411
it's,

1439
00:45:37,411 --> 00:45:37,721
it's,

1440
00:45:37,721 --> 00:45:38,640
it's difficult,

1441
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:43,760
but I think one of the characteristics
that we do know about psychedelics is

1442
00:45:45,031 --> 00:45:45,864
that they,

1443
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:51,440
they can induce this feeling of
what's been called portentous snus,

1444
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:52,410
right.

1445
00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:57,410
The feeling of a feeling that I've
experienced something is significant.

1446
00:45:58,801 --> 00:46:01,620
So feeling of reverence or awe or,

1447
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:03,173
you know,

1448
00:46:03,390 --> 00:46:07,020
all of those things that we associate
with religious sense abilities.

1449
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:07,950
You know,

1450
00:46:07,950 --> 00:46:10,080
it's not that psychedelics,

1451
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:11,760
you know,

1452
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:15,240
there are religions that have
been founded around psychedelics,

1453
00:46:15,241 --> 00:46:18,240
obviously the mushroom cults
and all of these things,

1454
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,730
but psychedelics are not a religion.

1455
00:46:20,731 --> 00:46:23,700
They are in a sense the religion or they,

1456
00:46:23,730 --> 00:46:24,120
they,

1457
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:29,120
they hit those parts of our brain that
are capable of having religious religious

1458
00:46:31,111 --> 00:46:32,940
responses in some way.

1459
00:46:34,050 --> 00:46:36,000
And so when you get that going,

1460
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:36,960
um,

1461
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:37,793
then

1462
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:43,860
you have these primates
with a sense of being

1463
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,370
in touch with some,

1464
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:47,701
you know,

1465
00:46:47,701 --> 00:46:52,701
in touch with some transcendent other
that is more significant that themselves,

1466
00:46:54,751 --> 00:46:54,990
that,

1467
00:46:54,990 --> 00:46:57,600
that they feel a longing for.

1468
00:46:57,601 --> 00:47:01,350
And I think that's the religious
sensibility and that that's also what,

1469
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:04,800
what drives our species forward,

1470
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:05,311
you know,

1471
00:47:05,311 --> 00:47:05,851
is this,

1472
00:47:05,851 --> 00:47:10,080
is this longing to know
the unknown essentially.

1473
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:10,500
You know,

1474
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:13,080
I mean the Terrance talked about,

1475
00:47:13,081 --> 00:47:17,730
and actually Rudolf Otto talked about
the psychedelics are a mysterium

1476
00:47:17,731 --> 00:47:18,600
tremendum,

1477
00:47:18,930 --> 00:47:19,763
right?

1478
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:22,830
Rudolf Otto talked about this.

1479
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:27,860
They are a tremendous mystery that is
terrifying and fascinating at the same

1480
00:47:30,251 --> 00:47:31,084
time.

1481
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:31,931
And,

1482
00:47:31,931 --> 00:47:32,764
uh,

1483
00:47:33,490 --> 00:47:36,200
this has been the
continuing carrots that's,

1484
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:38,830
that's pulled our species forward,

1485
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:39,660
you know,

1486
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:40,120
and,

1487
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:40,841
and my lectures,

1488
00:47:40,841 --> 00:47:45,340
I sometimes liken them to the
ID of the monolith in 2001.

1489
00:47:45,370 --> 00:47:46,110
If,

1490
00:47:46,110 --> 00:47:46,810
you know,

1491
00:47:46,810 --> 00:47:50,460
Kubrick tried to concretize that
idea and the idea of the monolith,

1492
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:52,750
something that's utterly alien,

1493
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:54,910
totally incomprehensible,

1494
00:47:54,911 --> 00:47:59,260
completely terrifying and fascinating,

1495
00:47:59,350 --> 00:47:59,920
right?

1496
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:04,920
They can't take their eyes off of it
and it inserts itself into history or

1497
00:48:06,761 --> 00:48:08,920
evolution at critical junctures.

1498
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:10,990
It just shows up,

1499
00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:11,741
you know,

1500
00:48:11,741 --> 00:48:12,910
and things happen.

1501
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:17,140
And I'm saying we don't need to invoke
the monolith because that's what the

1502
00:48:17,141 --> 00:48:18,670
psychedelics in nature,

1503
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:19,513
our,

1504
00:48:19,690 --> 00:48:20,080
you know,

1505
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:23,200
our own builtin monolith,

1506
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:23,921
you know,

1507
00:48:23,921 --> 00:48:25,390
built into the biosphere.

1508
00:48:26,390 --> 00:48:29,210
Do you find it frustrating
that that's not considered

1509
00:48:29,470 --> 00:48:30,540
mmm bye.

1510
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:36,360
Standard people of science when
they discuss theories of evolution,

1511
00:48:36,370 --> 00:48:37,110
the,

1512
00:48:37,110 --> 00:48:37,650
I mean they'll,

1513
00:48:37,650 --> 00:48:39,540
it's really strange to me.

1514
00:48:39,630 --> 00:48:41,550
I find how they factor it out.

1515
00:48:41,670 --> 00:48:42,030
Yeah.

1516
00:48:42,030 --> 00:48:43,140
It's weird how they,

1517
00:48:43,141 --> 00:48:43,231
uh,

1518
00:48:43,231 --> 00:48:45,360
there's obviously a bunch
of different factors.

1519
00:48:45,361 --> 00:48:46,230
Cooking meat,

1520
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:48,330
eat the throwing arm,

1521
00:48:48,331 --> 00:48:48,661
you know,

1522
00:48:48,661 --> 00:48:50,040
there's a lot of different factors,

1523
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:54,120
but why would they not
consider that as well?

1524
00:48:54,121 --> 00:48:55,560
That's always been really confusing to me.

1525
00:48:55,561 --> 00:48:58,180
And the only thing that makes
sense is that they haven't done it.

1526
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:00,151
There you go.

1527
00:49:00,151 --> 00:49:01,650
You're just sending an insight there.

1528
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:03,210
But I mean even,

1529
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:03,810
you know,

1530
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:04,643
um,

1531
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:05,993
um,

1532
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:07,770
Graham Hancock talks about this,

1533
00:49:07,771 --> 00:49:08,250
the uh,

1534
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:09,360
the person that wrote

1535
00:49:11,370 --> 00:49:16,370
this very interesting book
about the cave paintings,

1536
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:18,150
the mind and the brain.

1537
00:49:18,151 --> 00:49:19,230
This is the name of the book.

1538
00:49:19,231 --> 00:49:21,390
I forget the author at the moment,

1539
00:49:21,391 --> 00:49:23,400
but this very well respected,

1540
00:49:23,490 --> 00:49:23,791
you know,

1541
00:49:23,791 --> 00:49:28,791
South Africa scholar who wrote a
book about how altered states in,

1542
00:49:30,030 --> 00:49:30,480
you know,

1543
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:31,980
in the,

1544
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:32,400
you know,

1545
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:37,080
shamonic rituals carried out in the
dark or in the almost total darkness in

1546
00:49:37,081 --> 00:49:37,860
these caves.

1547
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:39,750
That's what the cave paintings were about.

1548
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:45,020
These things were painted by people in
highly altered states doing shamanic

1549
00:49:45,541 --> 00:49:46,321
ceremonies.

1550
00:49:46,321 --> 00:49:50,850
But even the guy who wrote the
book will not take mushrooms.

1551
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:51,390
You know,

1552
00:49:51,390 --> 00:49:54,840
Graham Hancock attempted to get him to,

1553
00:49:54,841 --> 00:49:59,210
I mean he wrote about his work with
great enthusiasm and evaporation.

1554
00:50:00,370 --> 00:50:00,690
You know,

1555
00:50:00,690 --> 00:50:02,670
if you want to confirm your theory,

1556
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:04,800
this is what you do.

1557
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:07,440
Why is it that did do it though?

1558
00:50:07,441 --> 00:50:09,390
If he did do and did do it publicly,

1559
00:50:09,391 --> 00:50:09,980
it would,

1560
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:10,920
it would hurt him.

1561
00:50:10,921 --> 00:50:12,480
And in in an academic sense.

1562
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:15,970
Well w do you know what that's
probably why he didn't do it.

1563
00:50:16,190 --> 00:50:17,280
Why would it hurt him?

1564
00:50:17,310 --> 00:50:21,810
I mean it seems to me it would hurt
him because drugs are verboten.

1565
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:22,511
Yeah,

1566
00:50:22,511 --> 00:50:22,830
no,

1567
00:50:22,830 --> 00:50:27,830
but in fact that is the honest thing

1568
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:29,980
to do as a scientist and,

1569
00:50:30,010 --> 00:50:33,440
and I think if enough of the right people,

1570
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:34,910
you know,

1571
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:38,750
the people in this field actually would
let themselves have this experience.

1572
00:50:38,751 --> 00:50:42,800
I think the controversy with resolve
itself because those of us who have

1573
00:50:42,801 --> 00:50:46,280
experienced it just seems obvious.

1574
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:47,301
It just seems,

1575
00:50:47,301 --> 00:50:52,190
it's very strange to me that it's not
considered even as a factor at all.

1576
00:50:52,191 --> 00:50:54,530
When if you've had the impact,

1577
00:50:55,030 --> 00:50:56,420
you've had the experience personally,

1578
00:50:56,421 --> 00:50:56,781
you know,

1579
00:50:56,781 --> 00:50:58,490
the incredible impact that it has,

1580
00:50:58,670 --> 00:51:02,810
how could that not be considered
in terms of something that affects

1581
00:51:02,811 --> 00:51:03,501
consciousness?

1582
00:51:03,501 --> 00:51:03,791
If you're,

1583
00:51:03,791 --> 00:51:06,560
you're talking about
someone who has no science,

1584
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:08,450
someone who has no books to read,

1585
00:51:08,451 --> 00:51:09,290
someone who has,

1586
00:51:09,291 --> 00:51:09,600
you know,

1587
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:11,720
whatever language existed at the time.

1588
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:16,840
Having a blowout psychedelic experience
would be so staggeringly profound on the

1589
00:51:18,171 --> 00:51:19,880
shaping of your vision of the world.

1590
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:22,160
But it's weird that it's not considered.

1591
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:27,160
And it's really a shame as far as the way
the people that educate people in this

1592
00:51:28,491 --> 00:51:28,881
world,

1593
00:51:28,881 --> 00:51:32,300
whether it's in high school or whether
it's in universities or colleges,

1594
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:33,321
that they're,

1595
00:51:33,321 --> 00:51:38,321
they personally are not aware and or
have been educated by this experience

1596
00:51:38,871 --> 00:51:39,650
because it's,

1597
00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:41,780
it's not what everybody thinks it is.

1598
00:51:41,810 --> 00:51:42,400
That we,

1599
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,870
everyone has this idea that
it's an escape from reality.

1600
00:51:44,871 --> 00:51:46,250
You're running away from things,

1601
00:51:46,251 --> 00:51:49,310
you're clouding things up
with the drugs and that the,

1602
00:51:49,311 --> 00:51:51,500
because it's under this one blanket,

1603
00:51:51,501 --> 00:51:53,540
this one blanket of description drugs,

1604
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:54,733
it's,

1605
00:51:55,550 --> 00:51:59,810
it's really weird that it's not considered
as a factor in the development of the

1606
00:51:59,811 --> 00:52:00,590
human being.

1607
00:52:00,590 --> 00:52:00,920
No,

1608
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:05,480
well exactly because of
the rubric kits put under,

1609
00:52:05,481 --> 00:52:06,560
I mean people,

1610
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:10,190
it's one of these things
that exists in the shadow,

1611
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:10,940
you know,

1612
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:11,301
it's,

1613
00:52:11,301 --> 00:52:12,650
it's in the shadow and,

1614
00:52:12,651 --> 00:52:17,651
and the reason it's in the shadow is
because it is a true mystery and true

1615
00:52:18,891 --> 00:52:21,770
mysteries are freighted with numinosity,

1616
00:52:21,771 --> 00:52:22,070
right.

1617
00:52:22,070 --> 00:52:24,110
With the numinous and you know,

1618
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:24,441
I mean,

1619
00:52:24,441 --> 00:52:28,760
despite the lip service that the
church pays to all this stuff,

1620
00:52:28,790 --> 00:52:29,061
I mean,

1621
00:52:29,061 --> 00:52:34,061
the main mission of the church is to
ensure that people do not have genuine

1622
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:37,940
religious experiences.

1623
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:38,391
Right?

1624
00:52:38,391 --> 00:52:39,170
I mean,

1625
00:52:39,170 --> 00:52:41,920
that's the most dangerous thing to the,

1626
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:43,970
to the church that
there could possibly be.

1627
00:52:43,971 --> 00:52:47,870
If someone bypasses all
the priests and the whole,

1628
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:48,740
you know,

1629
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:52,040
hierarchical structure and
just goes out and talks to God,

1630
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:52,341
well,

1631
00:52:52,341 --> 00:52:55,580
God's going to give you a different
message than the priests are giving you.

1632
00:52:55,581 --> 00:52:56,480
I tell you,

1633
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:57,320
you know,

1634
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:58,370
that's dangerous.

1635
00:52:58,400 --> 00:52:59,630
It's dangerous.

1636
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:01,280
What did you think of John Marco?

1637
00:53:01,281 --> 00:53:02,470
A allegro is work,

1638
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,460
the sacred mushroom in the cross.

1639
00:53:04,461 --> 00:53:05,880
His assertion that he,

1640
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:06,111
for,

1641
00:53:06,111 --> 00:53:07,370
for the folks who don't know this one,

1642
00:53:07,371 --> 00:53:08,151
just a brief one,

1643
00:53:08,151 --> 00:53:10,250
he was a scholar who was a,

1644
00:53:10,251 --> 00:53:14,450
an ordained minister
who became a theologian.

1645
00:53:14,451 --> 00:53:16,310
As he was PR studying theology.

1646
00:53:16,311 --> 00:53:20,840
He became a agnostic and
reviewed according to him,

1647
00:53:20,841 --> 00:53:24,500
the Dead Sea Scrolls and believed at
the end of 14 years of studying it,

1648
00:53:24,501 --> 00:53:26,040
that it was essentially the

1649
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:30,150
entire Christian religion was about
psychedelic mushroom use and fertility

1650
00:53:30,151 --> 00:53:30,930
cults.

1651
00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:35,040
And he wrote this book called the Sacred
Mushroom and the cross and it's his,

1652
00:53:35,070 --> 00:53:37,920
that's his assertions that
Jesus actually was a mushroom.

1653
00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:39,420
Well,

1654
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:40,170
I dunno,

1655
00:53:40,170 --> 00:53:41,700
I dunno if Jesus was a musher,

1656
00:53:41,701 --> 00:53:43,080
but I do think that,

1657
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:43,410
uh,

1658
00:53:43,410 --> 00:53:46,380
[inaudible] was a serious
scholar and I think he,

1659
00:53:46,530 --> 00:53:51,530
I think it's a shame that he was
vilified the way he was because he was a

1660
00:53:51,870 --> 00:53:53,010
philologist.

1661
00:53:53,011 --> 00:53:53,281
Right.

1662
00:53:53,281 --> 00:53:55,410
He was a specialist in these,

1663
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,480
in these aromatic languages.

1664
00:53:57,481 --> 00:54:01,290
He was one of the people appointed,

1665
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:05,940
one of the scholars appointed pointed
to the translation of the Dead Sea

1666
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:06,450
Scrolls.

1667
00:54:06,450 --> 00:54:07,800
And he was incidentally,

1668
00:54:07,801 --> 00:54:12,060
apparently according to Andy
relevant and people like that,

1669
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:16,890
he was the only one who wasn't a
priest on this committee for one thing.

1670
00:54:16,950 --> 00:54:21,950
So he was immediately sort of outside
the officially approved circles,

1671
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:24,690
I think to the,

1672
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:26,160
I'm not a philology list,

1673
00:54:26,190 --> 00:54:27,990
but I think to the extent that,

1674
00:54:27,991 --> 00:54:28,824
uh,

1675
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:30,110
I mean,

1676
00:54:30,110 --> 00:54:30,720
Eh,

1677
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:31,141
you know,

1678
00:54:31,141 --> 00:54:36,141
so I'm not really qualified to interpret
whether his scholarship was together or

1679
00:54:36,181 --> 00:54:36,770
not.

1680
00:54:36,770 --> 00:54:37,603
Uh,

1681
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:39,001
he was,

1682
00:54:39,001 --> 00:54:39,330
well,

1683
00:54:39,330 --> 00:54:39,640
it,

1684
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:42,330
he was well enough qualified
to be appointed to this,

1685
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:44,070
to this translation committee.

1686
00:54:44,430 --> 00:54:46,740
So he must've had something
going for himself.

1687
00:54:46,770 --> 00:54:48,180
And when he and his,

1688
00:54:48,181 --> 00:54:49,200
his account is,

1689
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:50,851
he says,

1690
00:54:50,851 --> 00:54:51,511
honestly,

1691
00:54:51,511 --> 00:54:51,901
you know,

1692
00:54:51,901 --> 00:54:56,901
when I reviewed all this stuff and
began to put two and two together,

1693
00:54:57,750 --> 00:55:02,430
it seems that there were all these
illusions to fungi and you know,

1694
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:04,050
to mushrooms and,

1695
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:04,650
uh,

1696
00:55:04,650 --> 00:55:06,870
I didn't come to this with this agenda.

1697
00:55:07,050 --> 00:55:08,460
That's what sitting here,

1698
00:55:09,090 --> 00:55:10,320
and he was a straight guy too.

1699
00:55:10,570 --> 00:55:11,670
He was a straight guy.

1700
00:55:11,790 --> 00:55:12,061
Yeah,

1701
00:55:12,061 --> 00:55:12,990
he was a straight guy.

1702
00:55:12,991 --> 00:55:13,820
So I,

1703
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:18,820
I think that he was a good example of
an honest scholar who honestly reported

1704
00:55:20,521 --> 00:55:24,540
what he found and who his
message was unacceptable.

1705
00:55:24,541 --> 00:55:26,010
And so the,

1706
00:55:26,070 --> 00:55:26,550
you know,

1707
00:55:26,550 --> 00:55:28,650
the establishment,

1708
00:55:28,651 --> 00:55:29,730
the powers that be,

1709
00:55:29,731 --> 00:55:34,731
the higher authorities decided basically
he had to be destroyed and he was,

1710
00:55:35,371 --> 00:55:38,340
his reputation was thoroughly trashed.

1711
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:39,293
Uh,

1712
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:40,260
uh,

1713
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:40,560
you know,

1714
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:41,790
now is it true?

1715
00:55:41,791 --> 00:55:42,330
I mean,

1716
00:55:42,330 --> 00:55:44,730
it was Jesus a mushroom.

1717
00:55:44,731 --> 00:55:47,520
Did they use Amanita miscarry
or some other mushrooms?

1718
00:55:47,521 --> 00:55:48,600
I think it's likely,

1719
00:55:49,350 --> 00:55:49,700
uh,

1720
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:49,920
you know,

1721
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:51,000
we know that the,

1722
00:55:51,001 --> 00:55:51,420
uh,

1723
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:53,430
the Gnostics,

1724
00:55:53,431 --> 00:55:58,380
which is the pre Christian
or quayside Christian group,

1725
00:55:58,410 --> 00:55:59,670
out of what you know,

1726
00:55:59,730 --> 00:56:04,730
that wrote the Dead Sea Scrolls out of
which Christianity supposedly sprang,

1727
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:07,770
um,

1728
00:56:07,770 --> 00:56:12,360
they have a lot of very peculiar notion
and notions that would be considered

1729
00:56:12,361 --> 00:56:13,410
heresy by,

1730
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:15,233
by,

1731
00:56:15,590 --> 00:56:15,900
you know,

1732
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:17,040
Christians now.

1733
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:17,431
I mean,

1734
00:56:17,431 --> 00:56:17,731
I mean,

1735
00:56:17,731 --> 00:56:18,810
the God of,

1736
00:56:18,870 --> 00:56:19,260
of,

1737
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:19,591
uh,

1738
00:56:19,591 --> 00:56:24,520
of the Bible of Genesis was seeing
that Gnosticism as an evil entity,

1739
00:56:24,550 --> 00:56:24,940
right?

1740
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:29,060
Because it was keeping
keeping humanity in prison in,

1741
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:30,790
in the world of matter,

1742
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:35,940
when the soul long to be liberated
into the light and all that.

1743
00:56:36,851 --> 00:56:39,970
So that was his view of this whole thing.

1744
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:41,770
That was not a Legros view,

1745
00:56:41,771 --> 00:56:43,450
but that was the view of gnosticism.

1746
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:46,900
That's a pretty psychedelic
vision right there.

1747
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:47,480
You know,

1748
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:47,811
and I,

1749
00:56:47,811 --> 00:56:51,550
I wouldn't surprise me
at all if this group,

1750
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:52,480
you know,

1751
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:53,440
I was,

1752
00:56:53,441 --> 00:56:53,770
uh,

1753
00:56:53,770 --> 00:56:55,630
was using either,

1754
00:56:55,631 --> 00:56:55,981
I'm an eight,

1755
00:56:55,981 --> 00:56:57,190
a miscarried and,

1756
00:56:57,220 --> 00:57:02,220
or some kind of psilocybin mushrooms to
craziest quote from the book was that he

1757
00:57:03,551 --> 00:57:08,140
had translated the word Christ
back to an ancient Sumerian word,

1758
00:57:08,141 --> 00:57:10,770
which meant a mushroom
covered in God's seaman.

1759
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:14,920
Yeah.

1760
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:15,753
Wow.

1761
00:57:16,810 --> 00:57:17,141
I mean,

1762
00:57:17,141 --> 00:57:17,974
that's a,

1763
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:19,700
that's a heavy one.

1764
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:20,151
Yeah.

1765
00:57:20,151 --> 00:57:21,950
Especially for a guy is not doing drugs.

1766
00:57:22,390 --> 00:57:23,223
Yeah.

1767
00:57:24,430 --> 00:57:27,320
I straight academic to
do this is what I got.

1768
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:28,400
Right.

1769
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,030
This is what he had and he had

1770
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:34,760
to be discredited because
that wasn't the message that,

1771
00:57:34,790 --> 00:57:35,623
you know,

1772
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:36,770
but uh,

1773
00:57:36,770 --> 00:57:39,170
but it's weird that she
wouldn't be surprised.

1774
00:57:39,171 --> 00:57:39,441
I mean,

1775
00:57:39,441 --> 00:57:42,020
the church has been suppressing stuff,

1776
00:57:42,050 --> 00:57:42,560
you know,

1777
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:43,371
for years.

1778
00:57:43,371 --> 00:57:43,790
I mean,

1779
00:57:43,790 --> 00:57:44,120
I mean,

1780
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:45,350
look at the Bible.

1781
00:57:45,351 --> 00:57:46,081
The Bible is,

1782
00:57:46,081 --> 00:57:50,320
I very select compendium of gospels,

1783
00:57:50,390 --> 00:57:54,080
but there's a lot of material that
never made the cut as we know.

1784
00:57:54,190 --> 00:57:55,930
It's weird that to me,

1785
00:57:55,960 --> 00:58:00,960
that with the incredible power that the
psychedelic mushrooms must have had on

1786
00:58:01,870 --> 00:58:02,501
ancient people,

1787
00:58:02,501 --> 00:58:04,300
we know people have been
taking them for a long time.

1788
00:58:04,301 --> 00:58:05,230
We don't we,

1789
00:58:05,231 --> 00:58:05,471
we,

1790
00:58:05,471 --> 00:58:07,450
we know for sure they existed.

1791
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:12,430
How are they not being used all
throughout these religions today?

1792
00:58:12,431 --> 00:58:13,264
Like how did,

1793
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:18,360
how did all the different intellectual
societies of this world lose touch with

1794
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:23,470
perhaps the very thing that gave us
our initial intellectual curiosity?

1795
00:58:23,471 --> 00:58:24,730
Like how did that happen?

1796
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:28,240
How could it happen that at
the highest levels of learning,

1797
00:58:28,270 --> 00:58:31,240
which is where we're at in 2012 if you,

1798
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:31,500
you know,

1799
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:32,950
if you follow a linear timeline,

1800
00:58:32,951 --> 00:58:34,540
this is advanced as we've ever been.

1801
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:36,550
So if that is the case,

1802
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:41,640
how is it possible that it's removed
from CNN and the New York Times?

1803
00:58:41,861 --> 00:58:45,910
It's not something that's being not
just a once in a blue moon John Hopkins

1804
00:58:45,911 --> 00:58:46,331
study,

1805
00:58:46,331 --> 00:58:48,580
which shows that it
improves your personality,

1806
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:51,520
but some legitimate consideration too,

1807
00:58:51,670 --> 00:58:55,510
that it might have been a factor in why
we're here and we're one of the reasons

1808
00:58:55,511 --> 00:58:56,830
why we're so fucked up.

1809
00:58:56,980 --> 00:59:00,670
One of the reasons why our society is
so crazy is because we're detached from

1810
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:04,930
one of the very things that might have
created this human being in the first

1811
00:59:04,931 --> 00:59:05,764
place.

1812
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:09,400
That seems to me to be something
that should be considered.

1813
00:59:09,670 --> 00:59:09,971
It's,

1814
00:59:09,971 --> 00:59:13,300
it seems to me like if you look at all
the other factors like eating meat and

1815
00:59:13,301 --> 00:59:14,740
the throwing arm and you know,

1816
00:59:14,741 --> 00:59:19,240
figuring out complex problems and hunting
and all the things that could have

1817
00:59:19,241 --> 00:59:20,074
happened,

1818
00:59:20,230 --> 00:59:25,230
how could you not be looking
really closely at this one
mushroom that makes you

1819
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:28,890
see incredible visions,

1820
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:33,540
explore realms that seem
realer than this real,

1821
00:59:33,630 --> 00:59:35,280
this reality that we live in right now.

1822
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:37,970
The only reason is because either you're,

1823
00:59:37,990 --> 00:59:38,411
you're,

1824
00:59:38,411 --> 00:59:38,871
you're,

1825
00:59:38,871 --> 00:59:42,870
you haven't experienced it or you have
experienced it and you're terrified and

1826
00:59:42,871 --> 00:59:44,790
you're trying to keep
everyone else from it.

1827
00:59:45,030 --> 00:59:45,900
Those are the only two.

1828
00:59:45,930 --> 00:59:46,440
So we're,

1829
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:47,273
you know,

1830
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:49,490
I think it's more the latter.

1831
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:49,991
I mean,

1832
00:59:49,991 --> 00:59:51,460
I think you know what,

1833
00:59:51,461 --> 00:59:55,450
we have to understand the proper venue,

1834
00:59:55,451 --> 00:59:56,171
if you will,

1835
00:59:56,171 --> 01:00:01,171
or the proper human institution to
kind of be the steward of this mystery.

1836
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:02,650
It's a real mystery,

1837
01:00:02,740 --> 01:00:03,573
right?

1838
01:00:03,990 --> 01:00:04,960
The Cape,

1839
01:00:05,020 --> 01:00:07,960
even though we understand a
lot about the neuroscience,

1840
01:00:07,961 --> 01:00:11,050
we can talk about neurochemistry
of receptors and all that.

1841
01:00:11,051 --> 01:00:16,051
That does not make the connection or cross
the bridge between what we experience

1842
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:17,620
when we take it.

1843
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:17,980
We,

1844
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:19,360
we know all about the,

1845
01:00:20,230 --> 01:00:23,170
the underlying neurophysiology of it,

1846
01:00:23,171 --> 01:00:27,160
but it still doesn't bridge the
gap to what we actually experience.

1847
01:00:27,161 --> 01:00:27,461
Right?

1848
01:00:27,461 --> 01:00:28,540
So it's important.

1849
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:29,020
So it,

1850
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:31,210
so I say it remains a mystery as,

1851
01:00:31,211 --> 01:00:32,500
as does the very,

1852
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:33,491
you know,

1853
01:00:33,491 --> 01:00:35,320
conundrum of consciousness.

1854
01:00:35,321 --> 01:00:35,591
You know,

1855
01:00:35,591 --> 01:00:39,610
how does the brain mind generate
or experience consciousness.

1856
01:00:40,060 --> 01:00:41,350
But you know,

1857
01:00:41,570 --> 01:00:46,570
it is a genuine mystery and human
institution and properly should be the

1858
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:49,810
province of religion.

1859
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:53,190
But religions don't serve that anymore.

1860
01:00:53,270 --> 01:00:55,840
Religions or political institutions,

1861
01:00:55,930 --> 01:00:56,380
right?

1862
01:00:56,380 --> 01:00:56,950
I mean they,

1863
01:00:56,950 --> 01:00:57,783
they,

1864
01:00:57,970 --> 01:00:59,650
if they have a real mystery,

1865
01:00:59,651 --> 01:01:04,030
they want to put it in a box and put it
over here someplace and keep people from

1866
01:01:04,031 --> 01:01:04,210
it.

1867
01:01:04,210 --> 01:01:05,020
You know,

1868
01:01:05,020 --> 01:01:09,700
because that gets in the way of Promo
gating the doctrine and the doctrine is,

1869
01:01:09,701 --> 01:01:10,001
you know,

1870
01:01:10,001 --> 01:01:11,020
told the line,

1871
01:01:11,050 --> 01:01:12,820
don't ask too many questions,

1872
01:01:13,030 --> 01:01:14,920
have faith or I,

1873
01:01:14,921 --> 01:01:16,150
you must have faith,

1874
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:17,620
which generally means,

1875
01:01:17,621 --> 01:01:20,290
which means essentially you
have to believe a lot of stuff.

1876
01:01:20,291 --> 01:01:22,960
We tell you that for
which there's no evidence.

1877
01:01:23,050 --> 01:01:23,890
That's another part of them.

1878
01:01:23,891 --> 01:01:26,440
You believe it because we
tell you to believe it.

1879
01:01:26,470 --> 01:01:28,090
So have faith.

1880
01:01:28,390 --> 01:01:28,960
Uh,

1881
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:30,640
don't ask too many questions.

1882
01:01:30,670 --> 01:01:31,300
Uh,

1883
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:31,811
you know,

1884
01:01:31,811 --> 01:01:32,141
and,

1885
01:01:32,141 --> 01:01:33,670
and basically told the lights.

1886
01:01:33,671 --> 01:01:37,060
So they're their political institutions.

1887
01:01:37,090 --> 01:01:42,090
Religions are there into bludgeoning
people into a certain mode of behavior and

1888
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:50,290
they work in conjunction now in our
culture with governments and corporations

1889
01:01:50,291 --> 01:01:51,460
and to have people,

1890
01:01:51,490 --> 01:01:51,821
you know,

1891
01:01:51,821 --> 01:01:53,320
taking mushrooms and,

1892
01:01:53,321 --> 01:01:58,090
and having all these funny ideas
and questioning the status quo.

1893
01:01:58,660 --> 01:01:59,493
This is not,

1894
01:01:59,530 --> 01:02:01,750
this doesn't serve the agenda,

1895
01:02:01,810 --> 01:02:02,480
you know,

1896
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:04,550
let the people who are making the agenda,

1897
01:02:04,551 --> 01:02:08,810
how many people really truly have had
the experience as it is it a very few.

1898
01:02:08,811 --> 01:02:09,644
So is it,

1899
01:02:09,770 --> 01:02:12,760
is it that they don't want
these people having that and,

1900
01:02:12,761 --> 01:02:13,001
and,

1901
01:02:13,001 --> 01:02:13,611
and you know,

1902
01:02:13,611 --> 01:02:17,630
thinking about things and coming up
with new solutions and trying to reshape

1903
01:02:17,631 --> 01:02:18,200
society?

1904
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:23,060
Or is it complete ignorance and just
trying to suppress it because it's,

1905
01:02:23,070 --> 01:02:24,420
it's in their best financial interest?

1906
01:02:25,490 --> 01:02:25,821
Well,

1907
01:02:25,821 --> 01:02:26,750
that's hard too.

1908
01:02:26,810 --> 01:02:28,130
That's really hard to know.

1909
01:02:28,131 --> 01:02:28,431
I mean,

1910
01:02:28,431 --> 01:02:31,060
whether they do it out of ignorance
or whether they were there,

1911
01:02:31,061 --> 01:02:33,020
there's a more sinister agenda,

1912
01:02:33,770 --> 01:02:34,390
which is,

1913
01:02:34,390 --> 01:02:34,670
you know,

1914
01:02:34,670 --> 01:02:37,610
perhaps some of them
have had this experience.

1915
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:38,090
And,

1916
01:02:38,090 --> 01:02:43,090
and realize that for people to be
having these types of experiences,

1917
01:02:43,611 --> 01:02:47,450
a threat to the status quo
because exactly as you say,

1918
01:02:47,660 --> 01:02:50,810
it motivates us to change the way we are,

1919
01:02:50,811 --> 01:02:53,000
to change the way we relate to the world.

1920
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:53,690
You know,

1921
01:02:53,690 --> 01:02:57,440
and we're no longer
good producer consumers.

1922
01:02:57,470 --> 01:02:58,131
You know,

1923
01:02:58,131 --> 01:03:00,260
we don't fit into the agenda anymore.

1924
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:00,861
I mean,

1925
01:03:00,861 --> 01:03:01,970
I think it's ironic,

1926
01:03:01,971 --> 01:03:02,510
you know,

1927
01:03:02,510 --> 01:03:03,650
it just,

1928
01:03:03,651 --> 01:03:04,101
in a way,

1929
01:03:04,101 --> 01:03:04,371
you know,

1930
01:03:04,371 --> 01:03:05,330
back in the 60s,

1931
01:03:05,331 --> 01:03:08,240
DMT used to be called
the businessman's trip,

1932
01:03:09,020 --> 01:03:09,351
right?

1933
01:03:09,351 --> 01:03:14,240
The idea was you could smoke it on your
lunch hour and get back to work after

1934
01:03:14,241 --> 01:03:14,961
your lunch hour,

1935
01:03:14,961 --> 01:03:16,910
except that after you've smoked DMT,

1936
01:03:17,090 --> 01:03:20,210
who would even want to
go back to your cubicle?

1937
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:21,200
You know?

1938
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:22,550
So they're inherently,

1939
01:03:22,570 --> 01:03:22,970
uh,

1940
01:03:22,970 --> 01:03:23,210
you know,

1941
01:03:23,210 --> 01:03:24,340
subversive in a,

1942
01:03:24,341 --> 01:03:29,341
in the sense that they encourage people
to take personal responsibility for

1943
01:03:30,861 --> 01:03:33,410
themselves and think for themselves.

1944
01:03:33,411 --> 01:03:35,240
Thinking for oneself.

1945
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:35,620
Is it

1946
01:03:35,620 --> 01:03:38,200
discouraged activity these days?

1947
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:42,610
There's also the issue of a lack
of guidance in this country,

1948
01:03:42,611 --> 01:03:46,570
especially when it comes to these
different things because of the fact that

1949
01:03:46,571 --> 01:03:47,230
they're illegal.

1950
01:03:47,230 --> 01:03:48,580
There's a lot of misinformation.

1951
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:50,330
There's a lot of misinformation.

1952
01:03:50,430 --> 01:03:52,060
Don't understand how to use them.

1953
01:03:52,061 --> 01:03:54,610
They don't understand where
they're going to get them from the,

1954
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:55,473
it's right.

1955
01:03:55,570 --> 01:03:58,240
If there was like,

1956
01:03:58,241 --> 01:04:03,241
it would be amazing if we had shamonic
institutes or people would go and there

1957
01:04:03,971 --> 01:04:07,120
would be someone who could
literally guide you along.

1958
01:04:07,121 --> 01:04:07,301
I mean,

1959
01:04:07,301 --> 01:04:12,301
if we were really an intelligent culture
that trusted each other as grown adults

1960
01:04:12,881 --> 01:04:15,230
with the ability to make choices and,

1961
01:04:15,231 --> 01:04:16,960
and have educated choices,

1962
01:04:17,550 --> 01:04:18,383
we,

1963
01:04:18,580 --> 01:04:18,851
you know,

1964
01:04:18,851 --> 01:04:21,190
it just seems like we're missing out.

1965
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:21,651
Well,

1966
01:04:21,651 --> 01:04:23,120
I give it 20 years.

1967
01:04:23,390 --> 01:04:24,350
I do.

1968
01:04:24,351 --> 01:04:24,860
I think,

1969
01:04:24,860 --> 01:04:27,380
I think that despite all the resistance,

1970
01:04:27,381 --> 01:04:28,970
that's probably where it's going.

1971
01:04:28,971 --> 01:04:29,181
I mean,

1972
01:04:29,181 --> 01:04:34,181
it will happen in a very subtle way and
it won't attract a lot of attention.

1973
01:04:35,631 --> 01:04:37,060
But I think that I,

1974
01:04:37,090 --> 01:04:37,371
you know,

1975
01:04:37,371 --> 01:04:39,680
until it's a done deal in a sense,

1976
01:04:39,950 --> 01:04:44,950
I think that what we're witnessing
now is that with this psychedelic

1977
01:04:45,051 --> 01:04:46,070
renaissance,

1978
01:04:46,071 --> 01:04:46,670
you know,

1979
01:04:46,670 --> 01:04:48,830
and it's six days and all that,

1980
01:04:48,860 --> 01:04:49,970
that's all gone.

1981
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:55,000
But now and a lot of the hysteria has
died down and now we're in a position to

1982
01:04:55,671 --> 01:05:00,671
revisit this whole thing and take
a second look in a calmer way.

1983
01:05:01,250 --> 01:05:06,250
And I think a lot of the research
that you see happening is going to,

1984
01:05:08,390 --> 01:05:08,781
I mean,

1985
01:05:08,781 --> 01:05:09,410
I know the,

1986
01:05:09,410 --> 01:05:09,651
I,

1987
01:05:09,651 --> 01:05:10,190
the work,

1988
01:05:10,190 --> 01:05:15,190
the institution I'm affiliated with on
that respect as the Heffter research

1989
01:05:15,201 --> 01:05:15,891
institute,

1990
01:05:15,891 --> 01:05:19,480
people should check that after.org um,

1991
01:05:19,510 --> 01:05:22,430
because most of the
leading researchers in,

1992
01:05:22,450 --> 01:05:25,060
in psychedelics are on our board.

1993
01:05:25,060 --> 01:05:30,060
Rider either on our board are supported
by or by halfed area to some degree.

1994
01:05:30,790 --> 01:05:31,623
Uh,

1995
01:05:31,630 --> 01:05:35,530
but the work that people like Roland
Griffiths or doing their other

1996
01:05:35,531 --> 01:05:36,430
investigators,

1997
01:05:36,431 --> 01:05:37,570
but he's well known,

1998
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:39,550
what he's doing is,

1999
01:05:39,551 --> 01:05:42,220
is the way you opened the door,

2000
01:05:42,370 --> 01:05:45,760
right to the use of these
things is two paths,

2001
01:05:45,761 --> 01:05:47,650
either religious or medicine.

2002
01:05:47,830 --> 01:05:48,580
You know,

2003
01:05:48,580 --> 01:05:52,750
if you could find a legitimate
medical use for silicide,

2004
01:05:53,860 --> 01:05:58,860
then that changes everything because that
means that the FDA can be pressured to

2005
01:06:00,041 --> 01:06:01,660
change the scheduling of it.

2006
01:06:02,470 --> 01:06:04,570
Once the scheduling of it has changed,

2007
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:05,890
it's now scheduled one.

2008
01:06:05,891 --> 01:06:06,251
Right.

2009
01:06:06,251 --> 01:06:07,510
And the first criteria,

2010
01:06:07,511 --> 01:06:08,141
and it was scheduled,

2011
01:06:08,141 --> 01:06:12,550
one is a dangerous drug with
no possible medical use.

2012
01:06:12,580 --> 01:06:12,791
Well,

2013
01:06:12,791 --> 01:06:17,791
if you do good rigorous science and
you do several clinical studies,

2014
01:06:18,131 --> 01:06:23,131
which is what they're doing with the
silicide when end of life kind of approach

2015
01:06:23,621 --> 01:06:24,320
to it,

2016
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:29,320
helping people to come to terms with
their impending death and deal with the

2017
01:06:29,941 --> 01:06:31,940
anxiety and they may,

2018
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:32,441
you know,

2019
01:06:32,441 --> 01:06:34,420
spiritual crisis around that.

2020
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:36,400
That's essentially what they're using.

2021
01:06:37,690 --> 01:06:42,690
But if you can show legitimately
that it has a use in that respect,

2022
01:06:43,210 --> 01:06:47,470
then you can change the
regulatory framework.

2023
01:06:47,471 --> 01:06:47,920
You can,

2024
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:51,280
you can actually get it
approved for that use.

2025
01:06:51,281 --> 01:06:53,980
Once it's approved for that use,

2026
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:59,010
you have to change the scheduling of it
from schedule one to probably schedule

2027
01:06:59,051 --> 01:06:59,884
too.

2028
01:07:00,790 --> 01:07:04,600
But then you open up the
possibility of off label uses,

2029
01:07:04,601 --> 01:07:05,260
right?

2030
01:07:05,260 --> 01:07:09,040
As with any drug and then
therapists can start to use it.

2031
01:07:09,041 --> 01:07:13,660
And I think that you will see in 10 years,

2032
01:07:13,661 --> 01:07:16,540
maybe you will see exactly that.

2033
01:07:16,541 --> 01:07:18,640
You will see institutes,

2034
01:07:18,641 --> 01:07:20,200
places where you can go.

2035
01:07:21,390 --> 01:07:21,790
I mean,

2036
01:07:21,790 --> 01:07:22,900
the next step is to say,

2037
01:07:22,901 --> 01:07:23,081
well,

2038
01:07:23,081 --> 01:07:23,390
sill,

2039
01:07:23,390 --> 01:07:25,240
if psilocybin can benefit dying,

2040
01:07:25,241 --> 01:07:26,680
people maybe can benefit.

2041
01:07:26,681 --> 01:07:27,700
Well people,

2042
01:07:27,730 --> 01:07:28,570
maybe it can help.

2043
01:07:28,571 --> 01:07:28,961
Well,

2044
01:07:28,961 --> 01:07:29,794
people,

2045
01:07:29,950 --> 01:07:33,970
people who are not sick come to PTSD.

2046
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:34,690
Uh,

2047
01:07:34,690 --> 01:07:35,890
another example,

2048
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:36,550
you know,

2049
01:07:36,550 --> 01:07:39,040
but just spiritual evolution,

2050
01:07:39,070 --> 01:07:40,510
just a discipline,

2051
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:41,380
you know,

2052
01:07:41,380 --> 01:07:41,860
uh,

2053
01:07:41,860 --> 01:07:43,450
which is what shamanism is.

2054
01:07:44,230 --> 01:07:47,500
People have to go to South
American now to find this stuff,

2055
01:07:47,530 --> 01:07:47,921
you know,

2056
01:07:47,921 --> 01:07:48,731
and they do.

2057
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:53,731
And a lot of them go there because
they're not finding any spiritual

2058
01:07:55,451 --> 01:07:58,030
satisfaction in our own institutions.

2059
01:07:58,031 --> 01:08:03,031
So what we have to do is create our
own institutions that are not copies of

2060
01:08:03,221 --> 01:08:04,600
South American shamanism,

2061
01:08:04,601 --> 01:08:05,350
but our own,

2062
01:08:05,350 --> 01:08:05,950
you know,

2063
01:08:05,950 --> 01:08:10,950
our own Neil shamanism in a sense the
borrows from these different traditions.

2064
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:13,690
But that works for us,

2065
01:08:13,750 --> 01:08:14,141
you know,

2066
01:08:14,141 --> 01:08:15,560
works in our culture.

2067
01:08:15,650 --> 01:08:16,400
Do you see

2068
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:19,850
the lack of a changing of the
classification of marijuana?

2069
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:20,930
It's still scheduled one,

2070
01:08:20,931 --> 01:08:23,420
despite all the evidence of
his medical uses for that.

2071
01:08:23,421 --> 01:08:25,220
Do you find that as like discouraging?

2072
01:08:25,221 --> 01:08:26,330
And if anybody hears that noise,

2073
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:28,540
that's Dennis play with velcro.

2074
01:08:28,550 --> 01:08:28,821
Okay.

2075
01:08:28,821 --> 01:08:32,930
Don't get mad at us and say that some
static electricity because people will get

2076
01:08:32,931 --> 01:08:35,080
mad and send like a
hundred Twitter masters.

2077
01:08:36,710 --> 01:08:39,530
I'm so sorry you're
showing fucking stone it.

2078
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:40,740
Sorry,

2079
01:08:40,740 --> 01:08:41,690
I'm a fiddler.

2080
01:08:41,691 --> 01:08:42,890
What can I say?

2081
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:44,451
Don't worry about it.

2082
01:08:44,451 --> 01:08:45,980
But deep back to the question,

2083
01:08:45,981 --> 01:08:47,900
do you see that the,

2084
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:48,470
um,

2085
01:08:48,470 --> 01:08:50,630
the classification from marijuana,

2086
01:08:50,631 --> 01:08:51,464
which still,

2087
01:08:51,650 --> 01:08:53,540
despite all the evidence to the contrary,

2088
01:08:53,541 --> 01:08:55,820
even some really interesting
stuff about cancer,

2089
01:08:56,180 --> 01:08:56,511
you know,

2090
01:08:56,511 --> 01:08:58,550
some all that Rick Simpson,

2091
01:08:58,551 --> 01:08:59,840
hemp seed oil and,

2092
01:08:59,841 --> 01:09:01,280
or I guess it's really hash oil.

2093
01:09:01,281 --> 01:09:05,510
It's cause it is psychoactive belts
hash and he calls it hemp oil.

2094
01:09:05,540 --> 01:09:07,580
I guess maybe to make
people feel better about it.

2095
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:08,833
Whatever it is,

2096
01:09:08,890 --> 01:09:09,450
they're there.

2097
01:09:09,450 --> 01:09:14,040
The work that that guy's done and all
the different studies that have shown the

2098
01:09:14,180 --> 01:09:16,370
what it does to for Glaucoma patients,

2099
01:09:16,371 --> 01:09:19,530
we had duds for wasting syndrome
and people will have a hard time.

2100
01:09:19,940 --> 01:09:22,790
Why is it there no change
in the classification of
that because it seems like

2101
01:09:22,791 --> 01:09:26,600
there's a good body of work that
shows some medical uses for it.

2102
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:29,000
Especially when you consider
the cocaine and schedule too.

2103
01:09:29,250 --> 01:09:29,551
Right.

2104
01:09:29,551 --> 01:09:33,780
Cocaine is scheduled too because
it hasn't recognized medical use.

2105
01:09:33,781 --> 01:09:34,230
Right.

2106
01:09:34,230 --> 01:09:35,063
That's hilarious.

2107
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:35,933
Well,

2108
01:09:35,970 --> 01:09:36,360
yeah,

2109
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:37,200
I mean the,

2110
01:09:39,050 --> 01:09:44,050
the whole situation in a way is I
think with respect to cannabis is,

2111
01:09:45,290 --> 01:09:50,290
is somehow different because it's so
freighted with political considerations.

2112
01:09:51,021 --> 01:09:55,820
I mean that don't really
play the psychedelics to
the same extent because even

2113
01:09:55,821 --> 01:10:00,470
though we're immersed in this world of
psychedelics and we think it's important,

2114
01:10:00,471 --> 01:10:01,400
we're still talking,

2115
01:10:01,550 --> 01:10:01,940
you know,

2116
01:10:01,940 --> 01:10:02,420
two,

2117
01:10:02,420 --> 01:10:05,120
3% of the population at most.

2118
01:10:05,570 --> 01:10:08,750
If that even gives a
shit about psychedelics,

2119
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:12,350
marijuana is like 60% of the population.

2120
01:10:12,351 --> 01:10:15,530
So I just think you're seeing,

2121
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:17,953
yeah.

2122
01:10:18,090 --> 01:10:18,871
You know,

2123
01:10:18,871 --> 01:10:19,261
I mean,

2124
01:10:19,261 --> 01:10:19,861
I don't know.

2125
01:10:19,861 --> 01:10:24,861
I think the pharmaceutical cartel in some
ways is lined up against this because

2126
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:29,900
medical marijuana is potentially so
useful for so many things that they're

2127
01:10:29,941 --> 01:10:33,930
making money on right now by
making drugs to treat them.

2128
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:34,830
And you know,

2129
01:10:34,830 --> 01:10:38,100
if you look at their research efforts,

2130
01:10:38,101 --> 01:10:41,880
if you look at what's going on in the
back room and they're not talking about,

2131
01:10:41,881 --> 01:10:44,880
they're totally into
cannabinoid chemistry,

2132
01:10:44,881 --> 01:10:45,300
right?

2133
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:47,910
I mean they're developing
all kinds of pharmaceuticals,

2134
01:10:47,911 --> 01:10:52,911
but those are patentable compounds that
they can own and produced synthetically

2135
01:10:54,871 --> 01:10:56,340
and charge you a lot of money for.

2136
01:10:56,640 --> 01:11:01,640
So I think that pot is a threat to the
hitch devotee of the pharmaceutical

2137
01:11:03,031 --> 01:11:03,864
cartels.

2138
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:04,890
That's one thing.

2139
01:11:05,370 --> 01:11:09,660
I think the government is kind of
deer in the headlights about it,

2140
01:11:09,690 --> 01:11:10,340
you know,

2141
01:11:10,340 --> 01:11:15,340
as the Obama administration's
to the latest legalization.

2142
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:18,780
I mean finally they're beginning
to get their act together.

2143
01:11:18,781 --> 01:11:19,890
I would say the right thing,

2144
01:11:19,891 --> 01:11:21,150
which is okay,

2145
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:22,260
apparently this,

2146
01:11:22,530 --> 01:11:26,730
we'll just let this social experiment
go forward and see where it goes,

2147
01:11:26,731 --> 01:11:28,650
which is the right thing to do.

2148
01:11:29,370 --> 01:11:31,860
And I think if they do that,

2149
01:11:31,861 --> 01:11:33,810
you'll see it evolve toward.

2150
01:11:33,870 --> 01:11:34,950
Other states will say,

2151
01:11:34,951 --> 01:11:35,371
well,

2152
01:11:35,371 --> 01:11:37,770
Washington and Colorado legalized pot,

2153
01:11:37,830 --> 01:11:42,570
they didn't collapse and they're
making a lot of money off taxes.

2154
01:11:43,050 --> 01:11:44,190
We want some of that.

2155
01:11:44,191 --> 01:11:44,941
We'll do that.

2156
01:11:44,941 --> 01:11:47,350
So I think he'll see it change over time.

2157
01:11:47,410 --> 01:11:48,410
But I would agree with you.

2158
01:11:48,411 --> 01:11:48,860
But what,

2159
01:11:48,860 --> 01:11:53,860
look what Obama did in the
first administration is his
first years with the DEA.

2160
01:11:54,051 --> 01:11:57,590
The Dea busted a lot of pot clubs where
he said he wasn't going to do that.

2161
01:11:57,620 --> 01:11:58,191
I know,

2162
01:11:58,191 --> 01:11:58,491
I know.

2163
01:11:58,491 --> 01:11:59,840
He said he wasn't going to do that.

2164
01:11:59,870 --> 01:12:00,800
And that's even grosser.

2165
01:12:00,801 --> 01:12:01,401
What they do,

2166
01:12:01,401 --> 01:12:02,330
what they actually do.

2167
01:12:02,340 --> 01:12:04,850
I know a bunch of people
that have been busted.

2168
01:12:05,150 --> 01:12:06,410
They take all your money,

2169
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:09,200
they take all your pot and then they
say your case is pending and they do

2170
01:12:09,201 --> 01:12:10,034
nothing.

2171
01:12:10,190 --> 01:12:10,731
They just,

2172
01:12:10,731 --> 01:12:11,810
they just rob you.

2173
01:12:12,510 --> 01:12:15,710
They essentially rob you and stop you
from doing business and scare the shit out

2174
01:12:15,711 --> 01:12:16,820
of you so you to do it again.

2175
01:12:16,940 --> 01:12:19,370
But because you're not
violating state law,

2176
01:12:19,670 --> 01:12:21,590
they don't really pursue you.

2177
01:12:21,591 --> 01:12:22,910
They just steal from you.

2178
01:12:22,911 --> 01:12:24,080
They just show it down.

2179
01:12:24,110 --> 01:12:28,460
They just ruin you financially and every
other way and physically because you're

2180
01:12:28,461 --> 01:12:31,550
going to be freaking out cause you're
thinking you might have to go to jail

2181
01:12:31,551 --> 01:12:35,900
cause federally what happens is when
you are not violating state law,

2182
01:12:35,930 --> 01:12:39,350
but you are violating federal
law when you go to trial,

2183
01:12:39,351 --> 01:12:42,500
they don't even let you use
the term medical marijuana.

2184
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:44,660
It's not allowed to be used in court.

2185
01:12:44,661 --> 01:12:45,560
It's an admissible.

2186
01:12:45,561 --> 01:12:48,560
So there is no medical marijuana in
the eyes of the federal government.

2187
01:12:48,561 --> 01:12:52,850
So you can't even defend yourself by
telling the people in the jury that you

2188
01:12:52,851 --> 01:12:55,520
were not in violation of a state law.

2189
01:12:55,880 --> 01:13:00,830
It's incredible and it's really
a terrible crime on humanity.

2190
01:13:00,860 --> 01:13:01,940
I mean that's really what it is.

2191
01:13:01,970 --> 01:13:05,110
And the government is
essentially a criminal cartel.

2192
01:13:05,150 --> 01:13:05,980
And the way that the,

2193
01:13:05,980 --> 01:13:08,260
and the way that they handled this,

2194
01:13:08,510 --> 01:13:09,200
the question,

2195
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:09,390
you know,

2196
01:13:09,390 --> 01:13:11,210
putting people in jail that do not,

2197
01:13:11,211 --> 01:13:13,340
not only do they not
deserve to be in jail,

2198
01:13:13,370 --> 01:13:16,760
they haven't done anything
wrong or they're providing
people with something that

2199
01:13:16,761 --> 01:13:19,520
they want and they're doing
it according to a law.

2200
01:13:19,730 --> 01:13:20,930
It's a state law.

2201
01:13:20,931 --> 01:13:22,940
And that is a real sickness.

2202
01:13:23,090 --> 01:13:26,750
When people think that they're vindicated
or justified in some way for locking

2203
01:13:26,751 --> 01:13:28,040
those people in cages.

2204
01:13:28,310 --> 01:13:29,600
Those are the real criminals.

2205
01:13:29,601 --> 01:13:32,870
That's the real criminals in our society
is that people that are locking people

2206
01:13:32,871 --> 01:13:33,890
in jail for pot,

2207
01:13:34,070 --> 01:13:38,540
and that's a real sickness and a
real end of the hypocrisy is just so

2208
01:13:38,541 --> 01:13:42,660
outstanding and everywhere in
every bar and every drug store,

2209
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:43,611
everywhere you go,

2210
01:13:43,611 --> 01:13:44,361
there's alcohol,

2211
01:13:44,361 --> 01:13:48,040
and yet you're going to lock these people
in a cage for doing something that's

2212
01:13:48,050 --> 01:13:49,190
not nearly as bad.

2213
01:13:49,220 --> 01:13:50,480
That's insane.

2214
01:13:50,730 --> 01:13:52,250
The here's the thing.

2215
01:13:52,460 --> 01:13:52,990
Yes,

2216
01:13:52,990 --> 01:13:54,830
it's everything you say is true,

2217
01:13:54,831 --> 01:13:57,290
but the thing is the
people see through this.

2218
01:13:57,291 --> 01:14:02,291
The fact that you could get this vote
in Washington and Colorado is a very

2219
01:14:02,601 --> 01:14:03,620
hopeful thing.

2220
01:14:03,650 --> 01:14:05,360
If they will let it go forward,

2221
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:10,010
then over time they'll begin
to see the benefits of that.

2222
01:14:10,220 --> 01:14:10,580
Right.

2223
01:14:10,580 --> 01:14:13,510
In the sense that exactly as you say,

2224
01:14:14,020 --> 01:14:16,870
pot smoking is not nearly
as harmful as alcohol,

2225
01:14:16,871 --> 01:14:21,280
so you'll see reduced traffic fatalities.

2226
01:14:21,310 --> 01:14:21,671
You know,

2227
01:14:21,671 --> 01:14:24,550
people may be driving stone
but they are safer drivers.

2228
01:14:24,551 --> 01:14:25,384
Or if they're stone,

2229
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:25,930
then they,

2230
01:14:25,930 --> 01:14:26,321
if they're,

2231
01:14:26,321 --> 01:14:27,520
if they're intoxicated,

2232
01:14:27,521 --> 01:14:32,521
you'll see reduced incidences of domestic
violence and other kinds of violence.

2233
01:14:32,561 --> 01:14:37,561
You'll see that actually letting people
smoke pot alleviates a lot of societal

2234
01:14:38,921 --> 01:14:40,920
problem and it won't eliminate that.

2235
01:14:41,230 --> 01:14:46,230
But you'll see statistically significant
reductions in a lot of the parameters

2236
01:14:46,751 --> 01:14:48,190
that you know,

2237
01:14:48,191 --> 01:14:50,390
because we know that alcohol re,

2238
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:51,250
you know,

2239
01:14:51,250 --> 01:14:53,660
fuels violent behavior at fuse,

2240
01:14:53,670 --> 01:14:55,210
it fuels domestic violence,

2241
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:56,500
traffic accidents,

2242
01:14:56,501 --> 01:14:57,400
all this stuff.

2243
01:14:58,270 --> 01:15:03,270
Those things will be reduced if people
start smoking pot in place of that.

2244
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:05,673
You know,

2245
01:15:06,030 --> 01:15:10,960
I guess I'm just disappointed in the fact
that it's taken so long that I become

2246
01:15:10,961 --> 01:15:12,640
kind of cynical to how the,

2247
01:15:12,641 --> 01:15:12,821
the,

2248
01:15:12,821 --> 01:15:15,910
the way the government
approaches it because it just
seems so ridiculous at this

2249
01:15:15,911 --> 01:15:16,211
point.

2250
01:15:16,211 --> 01:15:16,391
Well,

2251
01:15:16,391 --> 01:15:20,080
it does seem ridiculous and it's
like the emperor has no clothes.

2252
01:15:20,081 --> 01:15:24,790
I mean it's like this policy has so
long been in placed and there's so much

2253
01:15:24,791 --> 01:15:26,230
inertia behind it.

2254
01:15:26,260 --> 01:15:26,500
Right?

2255
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:29,560
There's the whole law
enforcement infrastructure,

2256
01:15:29,620 --> 01:15:29,981
you know,

2257
01:15:29,981 --> 01:15:30,910
the DEA,

2258
01:15:30,911 --> 01:15:33,250
the prison industrial complex,

2259
01:15:33,251 --> 01:15:33,970
the,

2260
01:15:33,970 --> 01:15:34,570
you know,

2261
01:15:34,570 --> 01:15:35,403
I mean,

2262
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:38,200
so many things depend on,

2263
01:15:38,620 --> 01:15:40,540
it's not just the drug cartels.

2264
01:15:40,541 --> 01:15:40,970
I mean,

2265
01:15:40,970 --> 01:15:42,670
and their profits go away.

2266
01:15:42,671 --> 01:15:47,230
But the whole governmental infrastructure
to support the prison guards union,

2267
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:48,670
all of those things,

2268
01:15:48,700 --> 01:15:50,290
they're enormously threatened.

2269
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:52,120
They don't want things to change.

2270
01:15:52,150 --> 01:15:52,481
You know,

2271
01:15:52,481 --> 01:15:56,050
the last people who wanted to
see pot legal is drug dealers.

2272
01:15:56,500 --> 01:15:58,470
Their profit margins go out the window.

2273
01:15:58,550 --> 01:16:00,160
I don't think they really
lobby that much though.

2274
01:16:00,460 --> 01:16:01,293
I don't know.

2275
01:16:01,770 --> 01:16:02,531
No they don't.

2276
01:16:02,531 --> 01:16:03,460
But you know what I mean?

2277
01:16:03,461 --> 01:16:07,510
And the government has a big
investment in the current,

2278
01:16:07,540 --> 01:16:08,373
you know,

2279
01:16:09,340 --> 01:16:10,240
situation.

2280
01:16:10,241 --> 01:16:11,170
I feel if anything,

2281
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:13,210
the one thing that's going to
change everything is the internet.

2282
01:16:13,420 --> 01:16:17,370
It's just the access to information is
so complete now that there's really the,

2283
01:16:17,420 --> 01:16:17,720
it's,

2284
01:16:17,720 --> 01:16:20,380
it's too hard to maintain an ignorance.

2285
01:16:20,410 --> 01:16:20,920
Right.

2286
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:22,510
And for people,

2287
01:16:22,511 --> 01:16:27,511
for the government to
maintain that marijuana has
no medical application is just

2288
01:16:28,451 --> 01:16:29,250
absurd.

2289
01:16:29,250 --> 01:16:29,470
I mean,

2290
01:16:29,470 --> 01:16:30,580
it's just absurd.

2291
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:31,500
Although they,

2292
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:35,860
they do everything they
can to discourage research.

2293
01:16:35,890 --> 01:16:36,280
You know,

2294
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:37,600
out of one side of their mouth,

2295
01:16:37,601 --> 01:16:37,961
they say,

2296
01:16:37,961 --> 01:16:38,141
well,

2297
01:16:38,141 --> 01:16:41,920
we want people to apply for
grants and we encourage research,

2298
01:16:41,921 --> 01:16:46,921
but then they make it impossible to get
legitimate sources of cannabis to do the

2299
01:16:47,141 --> 01:16:47,980
research.

2300
01:16:48,010 --> 01:16:48,843
So,

2301
01:16:49,060 --> 01:16:49,893
which is it,

2302
01:16:49,900 --> 01:16:50,540
you know,

2303
01:16:50,540 --> 01:16:50,770
uh,

2304
01:16:50,770 --> 01:16:52,120
so it is a,

2305
01:16:52,121 --> 01:16:53,380
it's a bad situation.

2306
01:16:53,381 --> 01:16:53,690
But,

2307
01:16:53,690 --> 01:16:53,770
uh,

2308
01:16:53,770 --> 01:16:54,790
but I would say this,

2309
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:58,390
I would say that we have to remember,

2310
01:16:58,420 --> 01:16:58,661
you know,

2311
01:16:58,661 --> 01:17:03,661
we have to take a longer term sort
of view of this and we have to remind

2312
01:17:03,671 --> 01:17:07,780
ourselves that we are
witnessing a what were,

2313
01:17:07,781 --> 01:17:10,400
what is really going on
here is a coevolution,

2314
01:17:10,700 --> 01:17:11,061
you know,

2315
01:17:11,061 --> 01:17:13,370
between us and these plants.

2316
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:15,140
And this has been going on for,

2317
01:17:15,770 --> 01:17:16,790
we don't know how long,

2318
01:17:16,791 --> 01:17:21,170
a hundred thousand years at least
cannabis is among those plants.

2319
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:21,640
Right?

2320
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:21,910
And,

2321
01:17:21,910 --> 01:17:22,760
and so

2322
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:28,220
if you take a small slice
of historical time and say,

2323
01:17:28,221 --> 01:17:29,630
what is our current,

2324
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:30,410
you know,

2325
01:17:30,410 --> 01:17:33,560
species relationship with these plants,

2326
01:17:33,561 --> 01:17:34,820
it does look very good.

2327
01:17:34,821 --> 01:17:35,654
You know,

2328
01:17:35,810 --> 01:17:37,460
they're being suppressed and all that.

2329
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:40,700
But it's a small slice of time in the end,

2330
01:17:40,701 --> 01:17:41,750
the plants when,

2331
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:42,710
right?

2332
01:17:42,710 --> 01:17:44,270
Because this is what's going on.

2333
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:49,360
The plants when you cannot eradicate
cannabis from the face of the earth,

2334
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:54,560
much as they might want to
and they really don't want to,

2335
01:17:55,100 --> 01:17:55,670
you know,

2336
01:17:55,670 --> 01:17:56,790
there's just a small

2337
01:17:56,790 --> 01:18:00,480
group that are profiting from it being
illegal and they would like to continue

2338
01:18:00,481 --> 01:18:00,931
to do so.

2339
01:18:00,931 --> 01:18:02,250
They wouldn't let you continue.

2340
01:18:02,251 --> 01:18:03,084
Yeah,

2341
01:18:03,210 --> 01:18:04,050
we'll change.

2342
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:05,430
It will change over time.

2343
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:06,020
You know,

2344
01:18:06,020 --> 01:18:06,260
I,

2345
01:18:06,260 --> 01:18:07,320
I really think so.

2346
01:18:07,980 --> 01:18:08,161
Yeah.

2347
01:18:08,161 --> 01:18:09,000
I guess like I said,

2348
01:18:09,001 --> 01:18:11,550
I think I'm frustrated by the
fact that it's taken so long.

2349
01:18:11,610 --> 01:18:12,270
But yeah,

2350
01:18:12,270 --> 01:18:16,830
but that's also because so many
people have had to suffer needlessly.

2351
01:18:16,831 --> 01:18:19,640
People that are in jail loud don't belong.

2352
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:23,700
This terrible case about a guy in Montana
who was a grower who was following the

2353
01:18:23,701 --> 01:18:24,390
state law,

2354
01:18:24,390 --> 01:18:28,890
even had a state law
enforcement authorities on a
regular basis come out to his

2355
01:18:28,891 --> 01:18:32,850
grow houses and he showed them what he
was doing is providing for all these

2356
01:18:32,851 --> 01:18:34,500
different patients in Montana.

2357
01:18:34,530 --> 01:18:37,410
And this guy's up for eight years in jail.

2358
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:37,900
You know,

2359
01:18:37,900 --> 01:18:38,060
he's,

2360
01:18:38,060 --> 01:18:41,970
he's up for more in jail then he would be,

2361
01:18:41,971 --> 01:18:42,804
if he killed somebody,

2362
01:18:42,970 --> 01:18:43,480
you know,

2363
01:18:43,480 --> 01:18:48,480
jails 25 to life for murder and this guy
is 80 years is as potential sentence.

2364
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:52,440
It's insane for growing some
plants that the state approved.

2365
01:18:52,470 --> 01:18:53,610
The state made a law.

2366
01:18:53,730 --> 01:18:54,570
They approved it.

2367
01:18:54,660 --> 01:18:55,560
He was there.

2368
01:18:56,190 --> 01:18:57,780
He brought the state people in.

2369
01:18:57,810 --> 01:18:58,171
They said,

2370
01:18:58,171 --> 01:18:58,770
Yup,

2371
01:18:58,770 --> 01:18:59,580
everything's good.

2372
01:18:59,580 --> 01:19:01,050
Brought the state police in.

2373
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:01,380
Yup.

2374
01:19:01,380 --> 01:19:02,213
Everything's good.

2375
01:19:02,220 --> 01:19:02,431
Okay,

2376
01:19:02,431 --> 01:19:02,940
we're good.

2377
01:19:02,940 --> 01:19:03,121
Okay,

2378
01:19:03,121 --> 01:19:03,540
we're good.

2379
01:19:03,540 --> 01:19:04,470
Let's grow some pot.

2380
01:19:04,590 --> 01:19:04,871
Right?

2381
01:19:04,871 --> 01:19:05,521
What was the plot?

2382
01:19:05,521 --> 01:19:09,540
Gives it to all the sick people and
now this poor guys and learned 80 or

2383
01:19:09,541 --> 01:19:10,050
stretch.

2384
01:19:10,050 --> 01:19:10,620
Right.

2385
01:19:10,620 --> 01:19:11,310
It's insane.

2386
01:19:11,310 --> 01:19:14,700
It comes in and now as a man
of science and you clearly are,

2387
01:19:15,020 --> 01:19:15,300
what,

2388
01:19:15,300 --> 01:19:15,570
what,

2389
01:19:15,570 --> 01:19:19,680
how do you feel when you see like CNN
and you see like doctor drew talking all

2390
01:19:19,681 --> 01:19:24,681
this craziness on CNN about withdrawal
symptoms and withdrawal syndromes.

2391
01:19:26,580 --> 01:19:27,780
He was saying from,

2392
01:19:27,781 --> 01:19:28,890
from cannabis use.

2393
01:19:29,070 --> 01:19:32,400
And how about the cannabis today is so
much stronger than it was where younger.

2394
01:19:32,401 --> 01:19:33,780
It's incredibly dangerous.

2395
01:19:33,930 --> 01:19:34,741
These words.

2396
01:19:34,741 --> 01:19:35,850
Incredibly dangerous.

2397
01:19:36,210 --> 01:19:38,190
It's like I hear this
nonsense and I'm like,

2398
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:43,280
this is again a man who can't
see describing a kaleidoscope.

2399
01:19:43,710 --> 01:19:47,760
This is a person who doesn't know
what the fuck they're talking about.

2400
01:19:47,970 --> 01:19:50,940
A guy who's incredibly straight and he's,

2401
01:19:50,941 --> 01:19:51,330
he's,

2402
01:19:51,330 --> 01:19:55,380
he's describing something
and it's always negative.

2403
01:19:55,560 --> 01:19:57,240
Ignore every artist,

2404
01:19:57,390 --> 01:20:01,560
ignore every person who tells you it makes
food taste better and makes sex feel,

2405
01:20:01,561 --> 01:20:02,610
but ignore all of that.

2406
01:20:02,820 --> 01:20:07,720
Ignore all these people that are quoting
all these positive things and focus on

2407
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:11,080
what is most likely bullshit.

2408
01:20:11,380 --> 01:20:11,771
If you,

2409
01:20:11,771 --> 01:20:16,020
if you go by personal experience like
what we all know if someone is having

2410
01:20:16,180 --> 01:20:18,100
psychotic episodes because of marijuana,

2411
01:20:18,220 --> 01:20:21,040
I have gotten to think they were going
to have psychotic episodes anyway.

2412
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:23,350
I got to think marijuana
just got them there.

2413
01:20:23,530 --> 01:20:24,580
They were already fucked.

2414
01:20:24,640 --> 01:20:24,911
I mean,

2415
01:20:24,911 --> 01:20:25,211
I would,

2416
01:20:25,211 --> 01:20:28,840
I would have to assume just knowing my
own personal experience with the drug,

2417
01:20:29,350 --> 01:20:32,560
when someone who hasn't had an experience
with the trunk and they're talking

2418
01:20:32,561 --> 01:20:33,190
about it,

2419
01:20:33,190 --> 01:20:34,330
it's maddening.

2420
01:20:34,470 --> 01:20:34,700
It's,

2421
01:20:34,700 --> 01:20:36,310
it's a crazy person talking.

2422
01:20:36,311 --> 01:20:36,670
It's like,

2423
01:20:36,670 --> 01:20:37,960
where are your bodies?

2424
01:20:38,140 --> 01:20:39,490
Where are these numbers?

2425
01:20:39,910 --> 01:20:40,240
Oh,

2426
01:20:40,240 --> 01:20:41,350
these people are,

2427
01:20:41,530 --> 01:20:42,070
you know,

2428
01:20:42,070 --> 01:20:43,630
their cultural icons.

2429
01:20:43,631 --> 01:20:46,900
Who are paid to paid to
be very important already.

2430
01:20:46,901 --> 01:20:47,230
Right.

2431
01:20:47,230 --> 01:20:49,510
Not just that paid by the
pharmaceutical companies,

2432
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:51,700
paid by the pharmaceutical companies,

2433
01:20:51,701 --> 01:20:52,540
the media,

2434
01:20:52,541 --> 01:20:55,150
everybody else to pull
it out a certain meme,

2435
01:20:55,151 --> 01:20:57,390
a certain message and you know,

2436
01:20:57,400 --> 01:20:59,140
so you shouldn't be surprised.

2437
01:20:59,170 --> 01:20:59,650
I mean,

2438
01:20:59,650 --> 01:21:01,270
I mean that's just,

2439
01:21:01,750 --> 01:21:02,450
you know,

2440
01:21:02,450 --> 01:21:03,670
this is drive you crazy though.

2441
01:21:04,780 --> 01:21:06,640
Like when you see that if
you have all the channels,

2442
01:21:07,180 --> 01:21:07,481
yeah,

2443
01:21:07,481 --> 01:21:08,051
it does.

2444
01:21:08,051 --> 01:21:08,291
I mean,

2445
01:21:08,291 --> 01:21:09,310
it drives me crazy,

2446
01:21:09,311 --> 01:21:13,420
but I'm so old and cynical
and jaded and you know,

2447
01:21:13,421 --> 01:21:13,851
I mean it,

2448
01:21:13,851 --> 01:21:15,790
it's like I've done it drives,

2449
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:19,360
it doesn't surprise me at all.

2450
01:21:19,390 --> 01:21:19,721
I mean,

2451
01:21:19,721 --> 01:21:23,530
I think the only solution is,

2452
01:21:23,620 --> 01:21:25,150
I'm not sure what the solution is.

2453
01:21:25,151 --> 01:21:29,920
The solution is to get the right
word out to people somehow.

2454
01:21:29,980 --> 01:21:32,950
And that's what things like
your program and other,

2455
01:21:33,010 --> 01:21:35,560
other channels I feel like I tried to do.

2456
01:21:35,560 --> 01:21:36,370
And uh,

2457
01:21:36,370 --> 01:21:36,980
you know,

2458
01:21:36,980 --> 01:21:37,451
I mean,

2459
01:21:37,451 --> 01:21:38,284
um,

2460
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:43,500
I like to plug Arrow would you probably
know about Arrow with wonderful people

2461
01:21:43,871 --> 01:21:48,430
who are doing a good job
of bringing actual facts,

2462
01:21:48,460 --> 01:21:49,090
you know,

2463
01:21:49,090 --> 01:21:50,080
to the table.

2464
01:21:50,081 --> 01:21:52,660
And so we need more resources like that.

2465
01:21:52,950 --> 01:21:54,550
And they're not pro or anti,

2466
01:21:54,890 --> 01:21:56,440
they're pro fact,

2467
01:21:56,920 --> 01:21:59,980
which is what I admire
about them as a trip.

2468
01:21:59,981 --> 01:22:04,300
Reports are very helpful for
very helpful and they will say,

2469
01:22:04,301 --> 01:22:04,990
you know,

2470
01:22:04,990 --> 01:22:06,910
the dangerous or this the,

2471
01:22:06,940 --> 01:22:07,480
you know,

2472
01:22:07,480 --> 01:22:10,600
you'd need to be aware of
these possible hazards and,

2473
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:11,913
and uh,

2474
01:22:11,950 --> 01:22:13,180
and that's the only thing,

2475
01:22:13,210 --> 01:22:14,170
education,

2476
01:22:14,171 --> 01:22:17,440
the only solution to this is just say no,

2477
01:22:17,860 --> 01:22:18,340
you know,

2478
01:22:18,340 --> 01:22:21,700
k n o w that's the thing,

2479
01:22:22,150 --> 01:22:22,750
you know,

2480
01:22:22,750 --> 01:22:23,261
and this is,

2481
01:22:23,261 --> 01:22:24,810
and it's all a matter of education.

2482
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:25,960
Some money.

2483
01:22:25,960 --> 01:22:26,250
Yeah.

2484
01:22:26,250 --> 01:22:27,083
It

2485
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:29,710
banded believe whose quote is that?

2486
01:22:29,711 --> 01:22:30,544
Just say,

2487
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:33,010
I think it's Timothy
leary should be online.

2488
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:35,110
If someone should have a
cafe pressure ready to go,

2489
01:22:35,810 --> 01:22:38,360
I'm going to get off on
amazon.com right after this.

2490
01:22:38,361 --> 01:22:38,661
And by,

2491
01:22:38,661 --> 01:22:38,920
you know,

2492
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:39,910
the thing is,

2493
01:22:39,970 --> 01:22:40,803
uh,

2494
01:22:42,010 --> 01:22:42,430
it's,

2495
01:22:42,430 --> 01:22:44,020
it's really all about education.

2496
01:22:44,021 --> 01:22:49,021
It's about empowering people to make
informed decisions about what kind of

2497
01:22:49,511 --> 01:22:50,950
substances that are going to use,

2498
01:22:50,951 --> 01:22:52,660
under what circumstances,

2499
01:22:53,290 --> 01:22:54,760
what their intentions are.

2500
01:22:54,761 --> 01:22:55,810
There's a protocol,

2501
01:22:55,811 --> 01:22:59,770
there's a way to use these
things in a positive way,

2502
01:22:59,771 --> 01:23:00,850
in a way to use them.

2503
01:23:01,150 --> 01:23:03,820
Destructively I'm fond of,

2504
01:23:03,910 --> 01:23:04,743
I mean,

2505
01:23:04,990 --> 01:23:06,490
I always tell my students

2506
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:11,380
there is no such thing as
a bad drug or a good drug.

2507
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:13,750
They don't have moral qualities.

2508
01:23:13,751 --> 01:23:16,060
Human beings have moral qualities.

2509
01:23:16,420 --> 01:23:19,350
There are plenty of
opportunities to misuse it,

2510
01:23:19,351 --> 01:23:22,060
drug or use a drug in a bad way.

2511
01:23:22,660 --> 01:23:24,370
That's not the drug's fault.

2512
01:23:24,430 --> 01:23:29,430
It's simply has the pharmacological
chemical properties that it has poisoned

2513
01:23:30,641 --> 01:23:31,210
isn't evil.

2514
01:23:31,210 --> 01:23:31,901
It's just poison.

2515
01:23:31,901 --> 01:23:33,730
It's all about how people use it,

2516
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:34,270
right?

2517
01:23:34,270 --> 01:23:37,390
It's human behavior is
what we need to focus on.

2518
01:23:37,391 --> 01:23:40,200
And that's what drug
education doesn't focus on it.

2519
01:23:40,270 --> 01:23:45,270
It talks about the drugs almost as though
they were demons are pathogens or like

2520
01:23:46,781 --> 01:23:51,610
they had some kind of independent
existence and they were an evil virus or

2521
01:23:51,611 --> 01:23:52,444
something.

2522
01:23:52,480 --> 01:23:53,350
They are not.

2523
01:23:53,380 --> 01:23:55,420
It's the way people use them.

2524
01:23:55,421 --> 01:23:56,200
And what,

2525
01:23:56,200 --> 01:24:01,030
what needs to happen
with drug education is,

2526
01:24:01,330 --> 01:24:01,720
you know,

2527
01:24:01,720 --> 01:24:02,890
they don't want to admit this,

2528
01:24:02,891 --> 01:24:03,550
but here's,

2529
01:24:03,550 --> 01:24:04,960
here's the ball truth of it.

2530
01:24:05,020 --> 01:24:08,950
It's not about teach telling
people do not use drugs,

2531
01:24:09,070 --> 01:24:09,401
right?

2532
01:24:09,401 --> 01:24:11,350
I mean they say that's
gotta be the message.

2533
01:24:11,351 --> 01:24:12,670
And that's the only message.

2534
01:24:14,050 --> 01:24:19,000
True Drug Education has got to
tell people how to use drugs.

2535
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:21,490
That's the difference.

2536
01:24:21,491 --> 01:24:22,560
How if you,

2537
01:24:22,900 --> 01:24:26,380
if you choose to use a
psychoactive substance,

2538
01:24:27,190 --> 01:24:29,350
then here's a way to use it.

2539
01:24:29,530 --> 01:24:29,831
You know,

2540
01:24:29,831 --> 01:24:34,030
here's what you do to maximize the
benefit of it and minimize the harm.

2541
01:24:34,031 --> 01:24:35,030
It's simply that's,

2542
01:24:36,070 --> 01:24:36,530
you know,

2543
01:24:36,530 --> 01:24:36,790
uh,

2544
01:24:36,790 --> 01:24:38,320
but drug education doesn't,

2545
01:24:38,350 --> 01:24:42,790
you can't institutionalize programs
that are going to tell people how to use

2546
01:24:42,791 --> 01:24:43,660
drugs.

2547
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:45,753
Isn't that funny though?

2548
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:46,593
It's funny.

2549
01:24:46,630 --> 01:24:46,931
I mean,

2550
01:24:46,931 --> 01:24:47,680
it's stupid.

2551
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:48,070
We,

2552
01:24:48,070 --> 01:24:48,550
we,

2553
01:24:48,550 --> 01:24:51,670
we expect people to
learn how to drive a car.

2554
01:24:52,360 --> 01:24:52,900
You know,

2555
01:24:52,900 --> 01:24:54,280
we encourage,

2556
01:24:54,310 --> 01:24:54,880
uh,

2557
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:56,650
responsible drinking,

2558
01:24:56,651 --> 01:24:57,580
whatever that is.

2559
01:24:57,581 --> 01:24:59,050
So in that one instant,

2560
01:24:59,110 --> 01:24:59,620
you know,

2561
01:24:59,620 --> 01:24:59,920
we,

2562
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:02,620
we say we encourage responsible usage,

2563
01:25:03,250 --> 01:25:06,190
not that people use it
in a responsible way.

2564
01:25:06,580 --> 01:25:06,791
Well,

2565
01:25:06,791 --> 01:25:09,580
I think we're big on people
figuring out shit for themselves,

2566
01:25:09,581 --> 01:25:12,400
which is why we send people out into
the world essentially with almost no

2567
01:25:12,401 --> 01:25:14,440
knowledge whatsoever about sex and love.

2568
01:25:14,710 --> 01:25:15,460
When you're young,

2569
01:25:15,460 --> 01:25:19,030
you just sort of have to stumble into
it at your most vulnerable and confused

2570
01:25:19,031 --> 01:25:19,690
time.

2571
01:25:19,690 --> 01:25:20,440
Same,

2572
01:25:20,440 --> 01:25:22,000
same issues.

2573
01:25:22,660 --> 01:25:24,220
Apply to sex,

2574
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:24,790
right?

2575
01:25:24,790 --> 01:25:27,640
Sex Education and drug education.

2576
01:25:27,670 --> 01:25:28,900
Our jokes.

2577
01:25:29,230 --> 01:25:33,970
I think they're currently
practice that that's a joke.

2578
01:25:33,971 --> 01:25:35,760
And what is also a joke is just the,

2579
01:25:35,790 --> 01:25:38,410
the raising of human beings.

2580
01:25:38,710 --> 01:25:42,250
I think so many people in this country
are being raised by people who are

2581
01:25:42,251 --> 01:25:43,720
essentially children their entire life.

2582
01:25:43,721 --> 01:25:48,721
They never really did develop a true
understanding of themselves or of their

2583
01:25:48,881 --> 01:25:51,850
place in the world or an objective
sense of this whole thing.

2584
01:25:51,851 --> 01:25:53,760
And then the great mystery of it all,

2585
01:25:53,761 --> 01:25:54,940
it's never conveyed.

2586
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:56,410
And then they raise children.

2587
01:25:56,411 --> 01:25:57,460
The children have to somewhere,

2588
01:25:57,461 --> 01:25:58,600
another wake up and go,

2589
01:25:58,640 --> 01:25:59,130
okay,

2590
01:25:59,130 --> 01:26:01,120
nobody knows what the fuck
is really going on here.

2591
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:01,970
This is we,

2592
01:26:02,030 --> 01:26:05,900
we live in a world of madness and
momentum and it just continues on the same

2593
01:26:05,901 --> 01:26:06,201
path.

2594
01:26:06,201 --> 01:26:07,580
Even though everyone knows it's crazy.

2595
01:26:07,610 --> 01:26:09,560
But can you imagine?

2596
01:26:09,710 --> 01:26:09,981
I mean,

2597
01:26:09,981 --> 01:26:13,010
how many people can step
out of that framework?

2598
01:26:13,011 --> 01:26:13,400
You know,

2599
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:14,270
it's rare.

2600
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:14,920
I mean,

2601
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:15,753
if here,

2602
01:26:16,490 --> 01:26:16,880
you know,

2603
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:17,840
if you grow up,

2604
01:26:17,870 --> 01:26:18,501
if you're,

2605
01:26:18,501 --> 01:26:21,200
if you're relay raised
in a religious household,

2606
01:26:21,350 --> 01:26:21,771
you know,

2607
01:26:21,771 --> 01:26:24,020
especially a fundamentalist household,

2608
01:26:24,380 --> 01:26:28,620
you're not encouraged to think
about very much discouraged,

2609
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:29,990
heavily discouraged.

2610
01:26:29,991 --> 01:26:31,250
You're encouraged to,

2611
01:26:32,420 --> 01:26:34,640
this is what you need to believe.

2612
01:26:34,641 --> 01:26:36,560
And all this other stuff is,

2613
01:26:36,590 --> 01:26:37,040
you know,

2614
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:38,290
heresy and you,

2615
01:26:38,300 --> 01:26:38,581
you,

2616
01:26:38,581 --> 01:26:38,971
you know,

2617
01:26:38,971 --> 01:26:39,910
you're condemned if,

2618
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:41,180
if you think about that.

2619
01:26:41,181 --> 01:26:42,920
So I really,

2620
01:26:42,980 --> 01:26:43,813
I mean,

2621
01:26:45,350 --> 01:26:45,621
well,

2622
01:26:45,621 --> 01:26:46,011
I don't know.

2623
01:26:46,011 --> 01:26:46,491
I mean,

2624
01:26:46,491 --> 01:26:50,630
we could get off for another 40 minutes
on antireligious Rachel's to say it,

2625
01:26:50,631 --> 01:26:51,464
just do it.

2626
01:26:52,340 --> 01:26:53,173
Don't say it.

2627
01:26:54,050 --> 01:26:54,660
Right.

2628
01:26:54,660 --> 01:26:55,050
It's the,

2629
01:26:55,050 --> 01:26:56,030
it's ideologies.

2630
01:26:56,570 --> 01:27:01,040
Any ideologies is that the issue is
when someone is thinking about what they

2631
01:27:01,041 --> 01:27:03,860
should do and it's already written
for them to subscribe to this,

2632
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:04,171
well,

2633
01:27:04,171 --> 01:27:05,630
everybody's situation is different.

2634
01:27:05,631 --> 01:27:07,160
Everybody's life is different,

2635
01:27:07,161 --> 01:27:08,900
your wants and needs are different.

2636
01:27:09,410 --> 01:27:14,410
And instead of all these different ideas
of what we're supposed to do and not

2637
01:27:16,131 --> 01:27:16,671
supposed to do,

2638
01:27:16,671 --> 01:27:18,230
and what is evil and what is good,

2639
01:27:18,530 --> 01:27:23,000
we've lost the ability to figure out what
kind of an impact what we're doing has

2640
01:27:23,001 --> 01:27:23,811
on other people.

2641
01:27:23,811 --> 01:27:25,670
And judging that first and foremost.

2642
01:27:25,671 --> 01:27:26,900
And that I think is a very,

2643
01:27:27,110 --> 01:27:30,650
very much a religious and a
psychedelic principle that I,

2644
01:27:30,651 --> 01:27:35,651
that idea the idea of
looking at everything and
how it's affecting the other

2645
01:27:35,901 --> 01:27:37,370
people around you first.

2646
01:27:37,700 --> 01:27:38,660
And if you did that,

2647
01:27:38,870 --> 01:27:42,290
no one would ever impose that kind
of restrictions on your children.

2648
01:27:42,410 --> 01:27:44,690
Because if you were truly looking
at the development of the children,

2649
01:27:44,691 --> 01:27:45,441
the first thing you'd say is,

2650
01:27:45,441 --> 01:27:45,561
well,

2651
01:27:45,561 --> 01:27:46,850
I don't want to fuck this kid up.

2652
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:47,390
Right.

2653
01:27:47,390 --> 01:27:47,721
You know,

2654
01:27:47,721 --> 01:27:50,780
instead of suppressing this kid and
having this unbelievable resistance,

2655
01:27:50,781 --> 01:27:53,210
which every God damn human
being has ever had ever,

2656
01:27:53,540 --> 01:27:55,280
when you tell someone not to do something,

2657
01:27:55,281 --> 01:27:56,091
they want to do it.

2658
01:27:56,091 --> 01:27:57,440
When you try to control them,

2659
01:27:57,530 --> 01:27:58,610
they want to break free.

2660
01:27:58,611 --> 01:27:59,930
When you're a controlling person,

2661
01:27:59,931 --> 01:28:02,570
they want to pierce their
nose and go fucking crazy.

2662
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:02,910
Right?

2663
01:28:02,910 --> 01:28:03,161
It's,

2664
01:28:03,161 --> 01:28:03,470
it's,

2665
01:28:03,470 --> 01:28:06,050
it's the same all throughout humanity.

2666
01:28:06,051 --> 01:28:06,884
So we should have,

2667
01:28:07,070 --> 01:28:08,750
we should be able to
figure that out by now.

2668
01:28:08,780 --> 01:28:09,613
Well,

2669
01:28:10,130 --> 01:28:11,960
some have and some do.

2670
01:28:11,961 --> 01:28:13,010
But do you know,

2671
01:28:13,011 --> 01:28:15,290
I mean for you to be able to say that,

2672
01:28:15,291 --> 01:28:16,880
to have that perception,

2673
01:28:17,150 --> 01:28:18,460
a million had to have it before you.

2674
01:28:18,620 --> 01:28:19,070
Well,

2675
01:28:19,070 --> 01:28:23,630
and you had how you have
to be an exceptionally in
the lighten minded person,

2676
01:28:23,780 --> 01:28:24,613
you know,

2677
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:25,400
if you're,

2678
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:26,510
or comedian or,

2679
01:28:26,660 --> 01:28:27,590
or someone.

2680
01:28:27,830 --> 01:28:28,071
Yeah,

2681
01:28:28,071 --> 01:28:28,671
exactly.

2682
01:28:28,671 --> 01:28:30,740
Who Pushes the envelope,

2683
01:28:30,860 --> 01:28:31,280
right?

2684
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:32,120
Who Really,

2685
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:37,370
who makes a profession of out of stepping
out of the box or trying to look at

2686
01:28:37,371 --> 01:28:38,200
things from,

2687
01:28:38,200 --> 01:28:38,510
you know,

2688
01:28:38,510 --> 01:28:39,560
a broader perspective.

2689
01:28:39,561 --> 01:28:40,820
But if you're a person who,

2690
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:41,301
you know,

2691
01:28:41,301 --> 01:28:41,481
I mean,

2692
01:28:41,481 --> 01:28:44,630
if you were raised in a
strict religious household,

2693
01:28:44,840 --> 01:28:49,130
chances are your children are going to
be raised in that household and you never

2694
01:28:49,131 --> 01:28:49,964
really look,

2695
01:28:50,150 --> 01:28:50,511
you know,

2696
01:28:50,511 --> 01:28:53,180
you never take the blinders
off because you know,

2697
01:28:53,181 --> 01:28:55,620
there's all sorts of bad
stuff out there and you,

2698
01:28:55,680 --> 01:28:57,770
you just don't want to know about it.

2699
01:28:59,260 --> 01:28:59,720
You know,

2700
01:28:59,720 --> 01:29:00,141
and,

2701
01:29:00,141 --> 01:29:01,380
and that's the problem.

2702
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:02,260
Uh,

2703
01:29:02,260 --> 01:29:03,093
you know,

2704
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:04,440
of the ideologies,

2705
01:29:04,470 --> 01:29:04,670
the,

2706
01:29:04,670 --> 01:29:06,930
the problem is that predetermined
patterns of thinking.

2707
01:29:07,210 --> 01:29:07,390
Yeah.

2708
01:29:07,390 --> 01:29:09,440
I'm in one of the things I like to say a,

2709
01:29:09,441 --> 01:29:14,441
I think that psychedelics are
extremely valuable with respect to,

2710
01:29:15,750 --> 01:29:15,991
you know,

2711
01:29:15,991 --> 01:29:19,320
sometimes I talk about faith.

2712
01:29:19,350 --> 01:29:23,220
One of the things that's interesting
about psychedelics is they don't require

2713
01:29:23,221 --> 01:29:23,970
faith,

2714
01:29:23,970 --> 01:29:24,331
right?

2715
01:29:24,331 --> 01:29:24,571
I mean,

2716
01:29:24,571 --> 01:29:25,590
religious belief,

2717
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:30,690
religious tenants are usually postulated
on this idea that here's a whole bunch

2718
01:29:30,691 --> 01:29:32,460
of things that you should believe.

2719
01:29:32,580 --> 01:29:35,250
And there's not a shred of
evidence for any of this,

2720
01:29:35,251 --> 01:29:36,600
but you must have faith.

2721
01:29:36,630 --> 01:29:37,500
My son,

2722
01:29:37,530 --> 01:29:37,891
right?

2723
01:29:37,891 --> 01:29:39,840
That this is why,

2724
01:29:39,900 --> 01:29:41,640
why should you have faith?

2725
01:29:41,870 --> 01:29:42,330
You know,

2726
01:29:42,330 --> 01:29:43,900
chances are it's a lie.

2727
01:29:43,901 --> 01:29:44,051
Yeah.

2728
01:29:44,051 --> 01:29:44,640
I mean,

2729
01:29:44,640 --> 01:29:45,270
you know,

2730
01:29:45,270 --> 01:29:50,270
we know that the religions have been
scamming this for centuries ontology.

2731
01:29:51,530 --> 01:29:52,363
Oh Wow.

2732
01:29:52,700 --> 01:29:53,533
They're legit.

2733
01:29:53,610 --> 01:29:54,150
Sure.

2734
01:29:54,150 --> 01:29:59,150
They're legit trying to join Scientology's
when he knows I see worth of my land.

2735
01:30:00,510 --> 01:30:02,490
But the thing is with psychedelics,

2736
01:30:02,700 --> 01:30:03,990
faith is an impediment.

2737
01:30:04,020 --> 01:30:05,280
You don't have to have faith.

2738
01:30:05,470 --> 01:30:08,490
We can just have what you
need to have is courage.

2739
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:10,380
But what do you say to the people,

2740
01:30:10,381 --> 01:30:11,214
the cynics,

2741
01:30:11,220 --> 01:30:11,540
the,

2742
01:30:11,540 --> 01:30:12,001
you know,

2743
01:30:12,001 --> 01:30:15,600
the people who would look at the
psychedelic experiences and say,

2744
01:30:15,601 --> 01:30:15,841
okay,

2745
01:30:15,841 --> 01:30:18,310
you are glorifying and,

2746
01:30:18,311 --> 01:30:23,100
and you're over exaggerating
what's essentially a hallucination.

2747
01:30:23,310 --> 01:30:28,260
Your visual cortex has being bombarded
with these foreign chemicals.

2748
01:30:28,380 --> 01:30:30,360
You're seeing things that aren't there.

2749
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:31,920
And all this is,

2750
01:30:31,921 --> 01:30:32,780
is just your,

2751
01:30:32,781 --> 01:30:37,170
your brains need to make something
profound out of what's essentially a

2752
01:30:37,171 --> 01:30:38,004
malfunction,

2753
01:30:38,210 --> 01:30:39,330
a malfunction of your,

2754
01:30:39,331 --> 01:30:39,660
you're,

2755
01:30:39,660 --> 01:30:43,140
you're thinking a malfunction of your
visuals and you've sort of attached to all

2756
01:30:43,141 --> 01:30:45,360
this importance to it
after the experiences over.

2757
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:46,290
Well,

2758
01:30:46,290 --> 01:30:47,190
that's the cynical point of view.

2759
01:30:47,310 --> 01:30:48,810
That's the cynical point of view.

2760
01:30:48,811 --> 01:30:49,531
But to that,

2761
01:30:49,531 --> 01:30:54,531
I would reply that you know
what we call ordinary reality,

2762
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:57,060
ordinary consciousness,

2763
01:30:57,420 --> 01:30:58,500
even consensus.

2764
01:30:58,500 --> 01:31:01,320
Reality is essentially a hallucination.

2765
01:31:01,890 --> 01:31:02,161
I mean,

2766
01:31:02,161 --> 01:31:02,401
right?

2767
01:31:02,401 --> 01:31:05,940
The reason drugs work is
because we're made of drugs.

2768
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:06,691
You know,

2769
01:31:06,691 --> 01:31:09,210
and whether or not we're on drugs or not,

2770
01:31:09,211 --> 01:31:10,830
our brains are creating,

2771
01:31:10,860 --> 01:31:11,220
you know,

2772
01:31:11,220 --> 01:31:12,510
this reality which,

2773
01:31:12,780 --> 01:31:16,260
which we know does not
resemble the real world.

2774
01:31:16,261 --> 01:31:17,130
Whatever that is.

2775
01:31:17,131 --> 01:31:21,450
I mean the instruments of our physics
and so on tell us that the world is a

2776
01:31:21,451 --> 01:31:23,730
quantum world is full of vibration.

2777
01:31:23,731 --> 01:31:26,010
That it doesn't look anything like this,

2778
01:31:26,120 --> 01:31:26,953
that Adams,

2779
01:31:26,980 --> 01:31:28,030
we mostly hard.

2780
01:31:28,170 --> 01:31:32,490
A lot of what our brain does
is synthesize a hallucination,

2781
01:31:32,640 --> 01:31:37,640
essentially create a model of the
world that we proceed to live in.

2782
01:31:39,210 --> 01:31:39,690
You know,

2783
01:31:39,690 --> 01:31:41,220
I mean the world that we,

2784
01:31:41,221 --> 01:31:43,420
you and I share and everyone shared,

2785
01:31:43,430 --> 01:31:45,120
this is a model of the world.

2786
01:31:45,150 --> 01:31:46,890
This is a model reality,

2787
01:31:46,891 --> 01:31:48,120
not the real reality.

2788
01:31:48,121 --> 01:31:53,121
The real reality is completely
unknowable and will always remain so.

2789
01:31:53,430 --> 01:31:54,660
So for people to say,

2790
01:31:54,661 --> 01:31:54,841
well,

2791
01:31:54,841 --> 01:31:55,674
you've just,

2792
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:56,221
yeah,

2793
01:31:56,221 --> 01:31:59,190
you've disturbed your brain
chemistry in a novel way.

2794
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:02,770
If you've tuned into
different channel essentially,

2795
01:32:02,771 --> 01:32:04,900
but you're still working with a model,

2796
01:32:05,350 --> 01:32:10,350
whether it's a model of the world
experience through the lens of a drug or

2797
01:32:11,711 --> 01:32:14,350
whether it's experienced
through the lens of,

2798
01:32:14,920 --> 01:32:15,251
you know,

2799
01:32:15,251 --> 01:32:17,170
sober conscious perception.

2800
01:32:17,171 --> 01:32:21,310
It's still a biochemical
artifact in a sense.

2801
01:32:21,340 --> 01:32:23,140
Our brains create this,

2802
01:32:23,710 --> 01:32:25,450
we live inside of it,

2803
01:32:25,510 --> 01:32:26,080
you know,

2804
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:27,100
and uh,

2805
01:32:27,430 --> 01:32:28,800
that's so,

2806
01:32:28,830 --> 01:32:32,380
so that's what I would say to
those people that it's not that,

2807
01:32:34,150 --> 01:32:34,510
you know,

2808
01:32:34,510 --> 01:32:39,510
there is some kind of objective reality
which we're immersed in when we're not

2809
01:32:40,481 --> 01:32:41,470
on drugs.

2810
01:32:41,710 --> 01:32:44,860
It's more that were on drugs all the time.

2811
01:32:45,160 --> 01:32:45,850
You know,

2812
01:32:45,850 --> 01:32:50,500
our brain is a organ that
happens to churn out drugs,

2813
01:32:50,970 --> 01:32:51,340
you know,

2814
01:32:51,340 --> 01:32:56,170
which we called neurotransmitters and
hormones and that's what our brains run

2815
01:32:56,171 --> 01:32:57,004
on.

2816
01:32:57,040 --> 01:32:57,910
So all,

2817
01:32:57,911 --> 01:33:02,740
all you do when you take an external drug
is you tweak one or more of those sets

2818
01:33:02,741 --> 01:33:04,000
of receptors that,

2819
01:33:04,001 --> 01:33:06,460
that there were Unser
talking to and you know,

2820
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:11,520
you get a slightly distorted
signal from what we,

2821
01:33:12,130 --> 01:33:14,890
what we have come to
accept as ordinary reality.

2822
01:33:15,130 --> 01:33:18,670
There is no ordinary reality
or we don't know what it is.

2823
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:19,421
It's,

2824
01:33:19,421 --> 01:33:23,920
it's forever unknowable in terms
of our subjective experience.

2825
01:33:24,240 --> 01:33:25,830
There's a very strong makes sense.

2826
01:33:25,860 --> 01:33:26,693
Yes it does.

2827
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:31,880
There's a very strange desire
to discount something that,

2828
01:33:32,120 --> 01:33:32,370
uh,

2829
01:33:32,370 --> 01:33:34,050
you can't like put on a scale.

2830
01:33:34,290 --> 01:33:36,900
He can't like can't bring it
back and show it to someone.

2831
01:33:37,080 --> 01:33:41,610
But essentially most of
what you experience in your
everyday life is just that.

2832
01:33:41,611 --> 01:33:42,510
It's just an experience.

2833
01:33:42,511 --> 01:33:43,350
You're seeing things,

2834
01:33:43,351 --> 01:33:45,030
you're feeling things
and you're traveling,

2835
01:33:45,031 --> 01:33:46,680
you're taking in information.

2836
01:33:46,980 --> 01:33:50,540
But we have this real
need a lot of people to,

2837
01:33:50,541 --> 01:33:53,960
to discount the things that
happened to discount the,

2838
01:33:53,990 --> 01:33:56,760
the vision of the psychedelic experience,

2839
01:33:56,761 --> 01:33:57,900
the hallucinations,

2840
01:33:57,901 --> 01:33:58,051
the,

2841
01:33:58,051 --> 01:33:58,980
the visuals,

2842
01:33:58,981 --> 01:33:59,180
the,

2843
01:33:59,180 --> 01:33:59,431
the,

2844
01:33:59,431 --> 01:34:01,440
the profound impact and the sounds.

2845
01:34:01,650 --> 01:34:05,640
Even though those are experiences that
you are taking in as an individual,

2846
01:34:05,641 --> 01:34:06,570
as a human being,

2847
01:34:06,571 --> 01:34:07,201
as an entity,

2848
01:34:07,201 --> 01:34:09,300
you're taking those in there.

2849
01:34:09,330 --> 01:34:10,163
They're dismissed.

2850
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:11,790
They're discounted because the,

2851
01:34:11,890 --> 01:34:12,181
you know,

2852
01:34:12,181 --> 01:34:13,014
you can't,

2853
01:34:13,080 --> 01:34:13,890
you can't hit them.

2854
01:34:13,890 --> 01:34:14,340
You can't,

2855
01:34:14,340 --> 01:34:15,360
you can't paint them.

2856
01:34:15,361 --> 01:34:15,811
You can't,

2857
01:34:15,811 --> 01:34:16,081
you know,

2858
01:34:16,081 --> 01:34:16,251
there,

2859
01:34:16,251 --> 01:34:16,981
there's nothing there.

2860
01:34:16,981 --> 01:34:17,814
You have nothing there.

2861
01:34:18,150 --> 01:34:19,770
You can't that experience,

2862
01:34:19,771 --> 01:34:21,450
although significant to you.

2863
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:22,451
Well,

2864
01:34:22,451 --> 01:34:22,840
yeah,

2865
01:34:22,840 --> 01:34:23,200
but,

2866
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:23,831
but now,

2867
01:34:23,831 --> 01:34:24,041
I mean,

2868
01:34:24,041 --> 01:34:29,041
that's part of the task I think is to be
able to bring something back from that

2869
01:34:29,261 --> 01:34:30,094
place.

2870
01:34:30,190 --> 01:34:31,840
And people do.

2871
01:34:31,900 --> 01:34:32,290
I mean,

2872
01:34:32,290 --> 01:34:36,910
I think that's a lot of what psychedelic
art does and these sort of creative

2873
01:34:37,240 --> 01:34:37,991
interfaces.

2874
01:34:37,991 --> 01:34:42,370
It's not that people go out
and take psychedelic drugs.

2875
01:34:42,371 --> 01:34:44,560
I've never produce anything.

2876
01:34:44,561 --> 01:34:44,980
You know,

2877
01:34:44,980 --> 01:34:49,980
those experiences influenced
them profoundly and you
may not be able to exactly

2878
01:34:51,671 --> 01:34:52,780
reproduce them.

2879
01:34:52,870 --> 01:34:55,810
But given the technologies
that we have access to,

2880
01:34:55,811 --> 01:34:58,040
you can come pretty darn close,

2881
01:34:58,430 --> 01:34:58,851
you know,

2882
01:34:58,851 --> 01:35:03,440
with multimedia technologies and
computer graphics and all this stuff.

2883
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:04,640
And it may be that,

2884
01:35:05,030 --> 01:35:05,863
you know,

2885
01:35:06,680 --> 01:35:07,100
well,

2886
01:35:07,100 --> 01:35:07,690
I mean I,

2887
01:35:07,690 --> 01:35:11,780
I think this technology is only
going to get better as we evolve,

2888
01:35:12,090 --> 01:35:12,590
you know,

2889
01:35:12,590 --> 01:35:15,590
toward it maybe a 10 or 15 years.

2890
01:35:15,591 --> 01:35:20,460
He won't have to take psychedelic drugs
because we'll have neurotechnologies

2891
01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:22,820
that just do the same thing,

2892
01:35:22,850 --> 01:35:23,241
you know,

2893
01:35:23,241 --> 01:35:24,770
or you maybe it is that you,

2894
01:35:25,730 --> 01:35:26,210
you know,

2895
01:35:26,210 --> 01:35:28,700
you take one psychedelic drug,

2896
01:35:28,701 --> 01:35:33,701
you take a capsule and it's a nano machine
that will on demand produce any kind

2897
01:35:35,451 --> 01:35:37,910
of altered state that you want to call up.

2898
01:35:38,760 --> 01:35:43,760
One of the more faster but also
within the realm of possibility.

2899
01:35:43,771 --> 01:35:46,770
That's the scary part is that
it's not just science fiction.

2900
01:35:46,771 --> 01:35:48,270
And one of my fascinating concepts,

2901
01:35:48,271 --> 01:35:48,950
et Cetera,

2902
01:35:48,950 --> 01:35:50,310
Terence had was the,

2903
01:35:50,311 --> 01:35:50,600
uh,

2904
01:35:50,600 --> 01:35:50,850
the,

2905
01:35:50,850 --> 01:35:53,940
the concept of the
singularity is he saw it,

2906
01:35:54,240 --> 01:35:54,571
you know,

2907
01:35:54,571 --> 01:35:54,871
the,

2908
01:35:54,871 --> 01:35:58,230
the technological singularity it a little
bit different than the Kurtzweil and a

2909
01:35:58,231 --> 01:35:59,380
lot of these futurists saw it.

2910
01:35:59,460 --> 01:36:03,570
He thought it was a very likely going
to be a time machine or something along

2911
01:36:03,571 --> 01:36:04,291
those lines.

2912
01:36:04,291 --> 01:36:05,124
Something that will,

2913
01:36:05,310 --> 01:36:08,850
they'll be created where there's a
new technology we're time ceases to be

2914
01:36:08,851 --> 01:36:09,540
linear.

2915
01:36:09,540 --> 01:36:10,410
What did you,

2916
01:36:10,440 --> 01:36:11,790
did you wrap your head around that?

2917
01:36:11,791 --> 01:36:13,530
Like how did you feel about that one?

2918
01:36:14,070 --> 01:36:14,371
Well,

2919
01:36:14,371 --> 01:36:15,180
yeah,

2920
01:36:15,180 --> 01:36:16,830
we did that mean we'd love to,

2921
01:36:17,340 --> 01:36:19,740
to play with that idea and uh,

2922
01:36:20,280 --> 01:36:20,551
you know,

2923
01:36:20,551 --> 01:36:21,660
in fact we used to,

2924
01:36:21,750 --> 01:36:22,170
you know,

2925
01:36:22,170 --> 01:36:27,170
Terry used to speculate that the 2012
that the singularity will be triggered the

2926
01:36:30,271 --> 01:36:35,271
moment that time travel is invented
and everyone and everyone after that,

2927
01:36:36,721 --> 01:36:41,721
we'll of course want a migrate back to
the original moment when time travel was

2928
01:36:41,821 --> 01:36:42,451
invented.

2929
01:36:42,451 --> 01:36:47,451
So suddenly there'll be all these time
machines condensing out of nowhere and

2930
01:36:48,350 --> 01:36:50,550
basically it's to do everything changes.

2931
01:36:50,551 --> 01:36:50,971
Right,

2932
01:36:50,971 --> 01:36:51,700
right.

2933
01:36:51,700 --> 01:36:56,470
James only can either wrap their head
around that idea that infinite time and

2934
01:36:56,471 --> 01:36:59,950
distance into the future would all be
able to access the moment the first time

2935
01:36:59,951 --> 01:37:00,790
machine was invented.

2936
01:37:00,840 --> 01:37:01,330
That's true.

2937
01:37:01,330 --> 01:37:02,110
All come back

2938
01:37:02,110 --> 01:37:02,491
time.

2939
01:37:02,491 --> 01:37:06,460
Travel would certainly change
everything if you could do that.

2940
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:08,560
I don't know.

2941
01:37:08,650 --> 01:37:13,650
I mean physics pretty much tells us that
time travel is technically possible,

2942
01:37:14,351 --> 01:37:19,351
but only if you have access to
manipulation of energies that are likely,

2943
01:37:21,821 --> 01:37:23,950
there'll be way beyond
us for quite awhile.

2944
01:37:23,980 --> 01:37:24,430
You know,

2945
01:37:24,430 --> 01:37:24,821
black,

2946
01:37:24,821 --> 01:37:29,821
whole levels of energy and that kind
of thing to do things with time.

2947
01:37:30,700 --> 01:37:34,630
But there's always a possibility
that there will be a breakthrough.

2948
01:37:35,050 --> 01:37:35,440
Right.

2949
01:37:35,440 --> 01:37:35,860
You know,

2950
01:37:35,860 --> 01:37:36,790
you never know.

2951
01:37:37,100 --> 01:37:38,170
Well we're gonna,

2952
01:37:38,320 --> 01:37:39,190
we're never going to stop.

2953
01:37:39,280 --> 01:37:44,280
My thought about human ingenuity and
the r constant desire for innovation is

2954
01:37:45,461 --> 01:37:46,900
that I don't ever see it stopping.

2955
01:37:46,901 --> 01:37:50,680
It seems to be a part of what the
human animal is and what it does here.

2956
01:37:50,770 --> 01:37:51,730
So when,

2957
01:37:51,940 --> 01:37:52,890
if someone like,

2958
01:37:53,050 --> 01:37:53,883
um,

2959
01:37:54,160 --> 01:37:55,960
I do not remember his name,

2960
01:37:56,800 --> 01:38:00,070
the guy out of a university
of Connecticut who was the,

2961
01:38:00,071 --> 01:38:02,140
he's the lead time travel,

2962
01:38:02,170 --> 01:38:02,530
uh,

2963
01:38:02,530 --> 01:38:03,363
expert.

2964
01:38:03,430 --> 01:38:05,010
It's a really fascinating character.

2965
01:38:05,210 --> 01:38:09,190
He's like a guy in the Spiderman book
because his father died when he was a

2966
01:38:09,191 --> 01:38:09,881
young boy.

2967
01:38:09,881 --> 01:38:14,320
So he became determined to build a time
machine to go back and save his father.

2968
01:38:14,500 --> 01:38:15,550
Oh yeah.

2969
01:38:15,670 --> 01:38:16,930
Really fascinating guy.

2970
01:38:16,931 --> 01:38:18,370
I cannot remember his name.

2971
01:38:18,700 --> 01:38:18,941
Uh,

2972
01:38:18,941 --> 01:38:19,960
I will eventually.

2973
01:38:20,190 --> 01:38:20,560
Um,

2974
01:38:20,560 --> 01:38:21,430
but his,

2975
01:38:21,490 --> 01:38:22,323
um,

2976
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:23,880
his Ronald Mallet,

2977
01:38:24,130 --> 01:38:24,491
his,

2978
01:38:24,491 --> 01:38:24,820
uh,

2979
01:38:24,820 --> 01:38:25,660
his idea,

2980
01:38:25,661 --> 01:38:26,910
I think a,

2981
01:38:26,920 --> 01:38:30,910
was that once he had really
thoroughly research time travel,

2982
01:38:30,911 --> 01:38:34,420
he realized that you would never be able
to go back before the moment of time.

2983
01:38:34,420 --> 01:38:36,190
Machine was invented that there's,

2984
01:38:36,191 --> 01:38:37,990
you're never going to
be able to go backwards,

2985
01:38:38,710 --> 01:38:40,540
but you can go back to that moment.

2986
01:38:40,541 --> 01:38:40,661
Yeah.

2987
01:38:40,661 --> 01:38:41,140
Well that's,

2988
01:38:41,140 --> 01:38:45,910
Terence had that idea long before
this guy did and this guy was like,

2989
01:38:45,940 --> 01:38:46,211
you know,

2990
01:38:46,211 --> 01:38:48,400
he's a legit peer reviewed scientists.

2991
01:38:48,790 --> 01:38:49,001
I mean,

2992
01:38:49,001 --> 01:38:49,810
he's had like,

2993
01:38:49,810 --> 01:38:52,020
he has a peer reviewed paper on the,

2994
01:38:52,021 --> 01:38:55,000
the science behind time travel
and they all agree that yeah,

2995
01:38:55,001 --> 01:38:56,680
if you could generate this
insane amount of power,

2996
01:38:56,681 --> 01:38:57,460
you could be able to do it.

2997
01:38:57,460 --> 01:38:58,150
You could do it.

2998
01:38:58,150 --> 01:39:01,480
I find it amazing that
Terrence had this idea as well,

2999
01:39:01,481 --> 01:39:04,750
like really long before it was
like sort of a mainstream thought.

3000
01:39:06,180 --> 01:39:06,900
Well,

3001
01:39:06,900 --> 01:39:07,410
you know,

3002
01:39:07,410 --> 01:39:12,410
you can attribute that to in a sense what
we were immersed in when we were kids.

3003
01:39:12,481 --> 01:39:17,481
I mean we were both completely
sucked into science fiction.

3004
01:39:17,881 --> 01:39:20,160
We were very much immersed
in science fiction,

3005
01:39:20,460 --> 01:39:22,800
hg wells novel the time,

3006
01:39:23,090 --> 01:39:23,710
just like,

3007
01:39:23,710 --> 01:39:23,980
you know,

3008
01:39:23,980 --> 01:39:25,020
at the time machine.

3009
01:39:25,021 --> 01:39:25,291
I mean,

3010
01:39:25,291 --> 01:39:28,080
that was a huge influence on me.

3011
01:39:28,081 --> 01:39:30,550
I probably read that sucker Tanner time.

3012
01:39:31,260 --> 01:39:32,610
I read that when I was a kid as well.

3013
01:39:32,630 --> 01:39:37,510
I was a whole lay fascinated by by that
I all the versions of the movie as well.

3014
01:39:37,580 --> 01:39:37,930
Well,

3015
01:39:37,930 --> 01:39:39,050
so at least two versions.

3016
01:39:39,930 --> 01:39:41,490
So at least two versions.

3017
01:39:41,491 --> 01:39:41,840
Yeah,

3018
01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:42,601
it versions.

3019
01:39:42,601 --> 01:39:45,660
I think the first one was
possibly a little better,

3020
01:39:45,690 --> 01:39:46,680
but yeah,

3021
01:39:46,681 --> 01:39:48,150
so those ideas,

3022
01:39:48,180 --> 01:39:48,720
you know,

3023
01:39:48,720 --> 01:39:49,350
we're,

3024
01:39:49,350 --> 01:39:51,120
we're out there and,

3025
01:39:51,140 --> 01:39:51,730
uh,

3026
01:39:51,730 --> 01:39:53,160
and again,

3027
01:39:53,161 --> 01:39:56,340
in other psychedelics and shamonic states,

3028
01:39:56,341 --> 01:39:57,720
you couldn't type travel,

3029
01:39:58,400 --> 01:39:58,770
you know,

3030
01:39:58,770 --> 01:40:02,460
have you read a Graham Hancock's do novel?

3031
01:40:02,550 --> 01:40:02,910
No.

3032
01:40:02,910 --> 01:40:03,750
Very interesting.

3033
01:40:04,140 --> 01:40:04,860
Tangled.

3034
01:40:04,860 --> 01:40:04,981
Oh,

3035
01:40:04,981 --> 01:40:05,790
you should read it.

3036
01:40:05,790 --> 01:40:06,480
I would love to.

3037
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:07,230
Very interesting.

3038
01:40:07,230 --> 01:40:09,260
I've read his nonfiction stuff and uh,

3039
01:40:09,300 --> 01:40:10,800
this is his first novel,

3040
01:40:10,801 --> 01:40:12,150
but it's all about a,

3041
01:40:12,510 --> 01:40:17,510
essentially a time bridge between a
shamonic person 17,000 years ago and a

3042
01:40:19,111 --> 01:40:24,111
modern counterpart and
they're communicating across
there and tangle literally

3043
01:40:26,280 --> 01:40:27,600
quantum entangled.

3044
01:40:27,601 --> 01:40:29,070
And it's,

3045
01:40:29,080 --> 01:40:32,280
it's quite a fascinating novel.

3046
01:40:32,310 --> 01:40:33,510
He had fun with it.

3047
01:40:33,660 --> 01:40:35,630
I find it amazing that we've able,

3048
01:40:35,640 --> 01:40:36,720
we've been able to,

3049
01:40:36,930 --> 01:40:37,950
for the most part,

3050
01:40:38,040 --> 01:40:39,390
not destroy ourselves

3051
01:40:39,640 --> 01:40:42,970
with nuclear power because nuclear
power and a lot of the ways,

3052
01:40:42,971 --> 01:40:43,840
the big impact,

3053
01:40:43,841 --> 01:40:45,820
the biggest impact that has
not just powering cities,

3054
01:40:45,821 --> 01:40:49,360
but destroying them and on the fact that
we've sort of figured out a way to put

3055
01:40:49,361 --> 01:40:50,290
a cap on that.

3056
01:40:50,680 --> 01:40:51,513
And really,

3057
01:40:51,580 --> 01:40:53,450
even despite all the conflict in world,

3058
01:40:53,451 --> 01:40:56,750
we haven't had a nuclear event
like that since the 1940s right.

3059
01:40:57,200 --> 01:41:02,200
I wonder how much more evolved we would
have to be to be responsible for the

3060
01:41:02,541 --> 01:41:03,830
actual use of a time machine.

3061
01:41:04,190 --> 01:41:04,580
I mean,

3062
01:41:04,580 --> 01:41:08,660
how much more evolved would we have to
be before we could have something like

3063
01:41:08,661 --> 01:41:08,961
that?

3064
01:41:08,961 --> 01:41:11,270
It wouldn't be the president
has access to the button.

3065
01:41:11,660 --> 01:41:12,201
It would be,

3066
01:41:12,201 --> 01:41:12,351
you know,

3067
01:41:12,351 --> 01:41:14,810
the president has access to
the hole in the universe.

3068
01:41:15,060 --> 01:41:15,530
You know?

3069
01:41:15,530 --> 01:41:16,363
I mean,

3070
01:41:16,390 --> 01:41:17,030
what,

3071
01:41:17,030 --> 01:41:19,040
how do we decide whether or
not we're going to do this?

3072
01:41:19,041 --> 01:41:21,170
How do we decide who we
go back in time and save?

3073
01:41:21,500 --> 01:41:21,771
You know,

3074
01:41:21,771 --> 01:41:23,240
when events happen in the news,

3075
01:41:23,241 --> 01:41:25,100
do we have like a congressional meeting?

3076
01:41:25,101 --> 01:41:28,380
Do we go back in time and a well person?

3077
01:41:28,570 --> 01:41:28,960
I mean,

3078
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:30,190
I think that's a,

3079
01:41:30,250 --> 01:41:33,700
that's a misunderstanding
of the nature of time,

3080
01:41:33,880 --> 01:41:34,300
right?

3081
01:41:34,300 --> 01:41:35,080
I mean,

3082
01:41:35,080 --> 01:41:35,913
if,

3083
01:41:37,770 --> 01:41:40,660
I mean one of the reasons
time travel is impossible,

3084
01:41:40,661 --> 01:41:44,650
supposedly that kind of time is
because you can't do those things.

3085
01:41:44,651 --> 01:41:48,490
You can't go back and prefab
the Kennedy assassination,

3086
01:41:49,130 --> 01:41:49,480
you know,

3087
01:41:49,480 --> 01:41:54,480
because you proliferate another timeline
and things to at least one more.

3088
01:41:54,730 --> 01:41:55,390
But then,

3089
01:41:55,390 --> 01:41:55,691
you know,

3090
01:41:55,691 --> 01:41:56,770
physicists tell us,

3091
01:41:57,250 --> 01:42:00,730
I'm the current theory is
everything you do pre precipitates,

3092
01:42:00,731 --> 01:42:01,564
you know,

3093
01:42:02,080 --> 01:42:04,660
proliferates multiple timelines.

3094
01:42:04,690 --> 01:42:07,930
It's please explain that because Duncan
and I have been trying to wrap our heads

3095
01:42:07,931 --> 01:42:08,940
around that one and we've,

3096
01:42:08,950 --> 01:42:10,840
we've brought it up to each
other a couple of times.

3097
01:42:10,841 --> 01:42:10,961
The,

3098
01:42:10,961 --> 01:42:11,090
I,

3099
01:42:11,090 --> 01:42:11,781
it's sort of a,

3100
01:42:11,781 --> 01:42:13,270
an abstract idea in my head,

3101
01:42:13,271 --> 01:42:16,720
but every decision you
make literally brings up,

3102
01:42:16,770 --> 01:42:17,050
uh,

3103
01:42:17,050 --> 01:42:18,970
creates a different universe,

3104
01:42:19,120 --> 01:42:23,320
creates a different universe and not
only every decision you ever make.

3105
01:42:23,321 --> 01:42:24,490
If I understand it,

3106
01:42:24,491 --> 01:42:25,540
it extends to,

3107
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:26,350
you know,

3108
01:42:26,350 --> 01:42:29,020
every collapse of a,

3109
01:42:29,021 --> 01:42:30,820
of a wave form every,

3110
01:42:30,821 --> 01:42:31,450
you know,

3111
01:42:31,450 --> 01:42:32,890
collision of Adam's,

3112
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:34,540
every event,

3113
01:42:34,600 --> 01:42:35,500
every offense,

3114
01:42:35,530 --> 01:42:40,530
no matter how minuscule or insignificant
that we're not even aware of

3115
01:42:40,780 --> 01:42:43,000
proliferates multiple,

3116
01:42:43,090 --> 01:42:45,160
multiple time frames.

3117
01:42:45,820 --> 01:42:47,290
It doesn't make sense.

3118
01:42:47,320 --> 01:42:50,440
Obviously we can't wrap
our head around this.

3119
01:42:50,441 --> 01:42:51,940
And it may be that we're,

3120
01:42:52,100 --> 01:42:52,933
you know,

3121
01:42:53,450 --> 01:42:53,801
I've been,

3122
01:42:53,801 --> 01:42:54,634
maybe we're not,

3123
01:42:54,880 --> 01:42:59,080
maybe we're not confined to one of these
timelines where it maybe we're living

3124
01:42:59,081 --> 01:43:02,470
simultaneously infinite
number of timelines.

3125
01:43:03,400 --> 01:43:04,240
That's so hard.

3126
01:43:04,810 --> 01:43:05,141
Yeah.

3127
01:43:05,141 --> 01:43:06,190
It's hard to wrap your head.

3128
01:43:06,490 --> 01:43:09,330
The idea of fractal universe is
an infinite amount of faculty,

3129
01:43:09,331 --> 01:43:11,860
universities and they're constantly
changing and moving like,

3130
01:43:12,130 --> 01:43:12,780
like a,

3131
01:43:12,780 --> 01:43:12,971
a,

3132
01:43:12,971 --> 01:43:15,220
a tide filled with cells,

3133
01:43:15,221 --> 01:43:19,360
like a tide of cells just washing
over the world over and over,

3134
01:43:19,361 --> 01:43:20,140
back and forth.

3135
01:43:20,140 --> 01:43:20,973
It never ends,

3136
01:43:21,430 --> 01:43:22,180
but why not?

3137
01:43:22,180 --> 01:43:22,890
What,

3138
01:43:22,890 --> 01:43:23,321
why,

3139
01:43:23,321 --> 01:43:24,370
why reality?

3140
01:43:24,371 --> 01:43:24,911
Why this,

3141
01:43:24,911 --> 01:43:26,440
this is a bizarre enough as it is.

3142
01:43:26,710 --> 01:43:27,370
Exactly.

3143
01:43:27,370 --> 01:43:27,891
I've always said to be,

3144
01:43:27,891 --> 01:43:28,211
be like,

3145
01:43:28,211 --> 01:43:28,690
if you don't,

3146
01:43:28,690 --> 01:43:28,990
if you,

3147
01:43:28,990 --> 01:43:29,321
you know,

3148
01:43:29,321 --> 01:43:31,600
you don't want to have a
psychedelic experience,

3149
01:43:31,810 --> 01:43:32,231
you are,

3150
01:43:32,231 --> 01:43:33,220
whether you like it or not,

3151
01:43:33,250 --> 01:43:34,090
it's called life.

3152
01:43:34,240 --> 01:43:38,230
Because if you existed in some sort of
a logical continuum of real objective

3153
01:43:38,231 --> 01:43:38,951
thought and reasoning,

3154
01:43:38,951 --> 01:43:40,110
and you had to exist in,

3155
01:43:40,111 --> 01:43:40,944
in life,

3156
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:44,920
in today and the human world
in 2012 and that was my point.

3157
01:43:44,950 --> 01:43:46,540
That's what we were saying earlier.

3158
01:43:46,541 --> 01:43:50,740
The brain is a machine that simulates
the reality that we live in.

3159
01:43:51,260 --> 01:43:51,830
You know,

3160
01:43:51,830 --> 01:43:52,040
and

3161
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:52,873
then,

3162
01:43:53,180 --> 01:43:53,511
you know,

3163
01:43:53,511 --> 01:43:54,230
so,

3164
01:43:54,230 --> 01:43:55,011
so it,

3165
01:43:55,011 --> 01:43:55,940
it just is,

3166
01:43:55,941 --> 01:43:56,211
I mean,

3167
01:43:56,211 --> 01:43:57,080
it's our,

3168
01:43:58,150 --> 01:43:58,680
it,

3169
01:43:58,680 --> 01:44:03,680
it takes the raw data of experience and
it mixes it together in the way that,

3170
01:44:04,970 --> 01:44:09,830
and it extrudes it into
something comprehensible.

3171
01:44:09,860 --> 01:44:14,860
So the brain is as much a processor
of this data from outside visit.

3172
01:44:15,220 --> 01:44:15,501
I mean,

3173
01:44:15,501 --> 01:44:16,010
I don't,

3174
01:44:16,010 --> 01:44:21,010
I think the question of whether the braid
generates consciousness is one of the

3175
01:44:21,321 --> 01:44:21,950
con,

3176
01:44:21,950 --> 01:44:22,521
you know,

3177
01:44:22,521 --> 01:44:25,190
one of the things that
neuroscience has to confront,

3178
01:44:25,220 --> 01:44:27,800
and I think the evidence
is that it doesn't,

3179
01:44:27,950 --> 01:44:30,330
it's more a real detector
of consciousness.

3180
01:44:30,760 --> 01:44:33,250
This what evidence,

3181
01:44:33,380 --> 01:44:34,191
what evidence is this?

3182
01:44:34,191 --> 01:44:34,570
That the,

3183
01:44:34,570 --> 01:44:36,170
the brain detect consequences?

3184
01:44:36,360 --> 01:44:36,710
Well,

3185
01:44:36,710 --> 01:44:40,580
it's not all of the evidence
of non ordinary states.

3186
01:44:40,581 --> 01:44:41,090
You know,

3187
01:44:41,090 --> 01:44:45,350
these other dimensions that for
shamanism and for psychedelics,

3188
01:44:45,351 --> 01:44:47,240
they present as real.

3189
01:44:47,930 --> 01:44:48,171
I mean,

3190
01:44:48,171 --> 01:44:50,090
does the brain dream all those up?

3191
01:44:50,180 --> 01:44:50,880
Why is the,

3192
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:53,750
why are there commonalities
between those states?

3193
01:44:53,870 --> 01:44:54,140
Uh,

3194
01:44:54,140 --> 01:44:54,441
you know,

3195
01:44:54,441 --> 01:44:55,370
between people.

3196
01:44:55,371 --> 01:44:55,581
I mean,

3197
01:44:55,581 --> 01:45:00,581
you don't have to be fans of Terence
and Dennis Mckenna to take DMT,

3198
01:45:01,371 --> 01:45:03,440
have to have similar experiences,

3199
01:45:03,500 --> 01:45:04,190
you know,

3200
01:45:04,190 --> 01:45:05,620
to us.

3201
01:45:05,630 --> 01:45:06,500
So I think,

3202
01:45:07,670 --> 01:45:12,670
I just don't think that we really have
a definitive way to say that all of what

3203
01:45:15,261 --> 01:45:17,690
we experience arises from the brain.

3204
01:45:17,720 --> 01:45:18,710
It's more that

3205
01:45:20,360 --> 01:45:25,360
consciousness is built into the
structure of space time in a certain way.

3206
01:45:27,471 --> 01:45:32,471
And our brains are detectors
and processors much in
the way of television is a

3207
01:45:33,621 --> 01:45:35,150
detector of a signal,

3208
01:45:35,660 --> 01:45:36,171
takes it,

3209
01:45:36,171 --> 01:45:40,270
the signal processes it in a way that's
comprehensible and puts it out there,

3210
01:45:40,410 --> 01:45:41,210
the screen.

3211
01:45:41,210 --> 01:45:41,951
So the,

3212
01:45:41,951 --> 01:45:46,670
the ego and the personality and the
lifestyle you choose and what have you as

3213
01:45:46,671 --> 01:45:48,020
you're making your way through this,

3214
01:45:48,050 --> 01:45:51,740
this dimension is essentially just
clothing that you wear in a shield,

3215
01:45:51,741 --> 01:45:54,320
you from the great outdoors
of reality essentially.

3216
01:45:54,500 --> 01:45:55,160
Yeah.

3217
01:45:55,160 --> 01:45:56,840
It's a model that you create.

3218
01:45:56,990 --> 01:45:59,630
It's a model that you create
and it helps you get through.

3219
01:45:59,631 --> 01:46:00,080
This,

3220
01:46:00,080 --> 01:46:03,890
helps you get through it
and it maps closely enough,

3221
01:46:03,891 --> 01:46:08,690
close enough to some external reality
out there that you can navigate.

3222
01:46:08,720 --> 01:46:12,200
You're not stepping off
cliff cliffs or you know,

3223
01:46:12,201 --> 01:46:13,700
walking in front of buses.

3224
01:46:13,701 --> 01:46:18,701
So it has a definite survival value
and there's enough overlap between what

3225
01:46:18,920 --> 01:46:23,920
you're consensual world is and mine is
and ours is that we can talk to each

3226
01:46:26,331 --> 01:46:26,720
other,

3227
01:46:26,720 --> 01:46:29,390
we can live in this same space.

3228
01:46:30,470 --> 01:46:32,110
It out to a certain extent.

3229
01:46:33,790 --> 01:46:35,480
Fascinating concept and it,

3230
01:46:35,490 --> 01:46:39,850
it really is and that's one of the more
profound aspects of the psychedelic

3231
01:46:39,851 --> 01:46:40,420
experiences.

3232
01:46:40,420 --> 01:46:45,420
The stripping away of that personality
and culture and and and everything and

3233
01:46:45,971 --> 01:46:50,040
getting to some weird strange source
getting to this strange that exists

3234
01:46:50,270 --> 01:46:54,870
is this clear thought without our a
minute you get to turn the circuit board

3235
01:46:54,871 --> 01:46:55,590
over,

3236
01:46:55,590 --> 01:46:55,920
right?

3237
01:46:55,920 --> 01:46:57,030
You begin to turn,

3238
01:46:57,060 --> 01:46:59,550
you get to turn it over
and see how it's wired.

3239
01:46:59,551 --> 01:47:00,810
I think that's one of the

3240
01:47:02,290 --> 01:47:03,160
big

3241
01:47:04,130 --> 01:47:04,791
useful,

3242
01:47:04,791 --> 01:47:08,900
interesting things about
psychedelics and particularly DMT.

3243
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:14,440
DMT just rips the curtain back and you'd
get to see the raw data of experience

3244
01:47:16,160 --> 01:47:17,480
and how it's all,

3245
01:47:17,481 --> 01:47:18,380
it's everything.

3246
01:47:18,381 --> 01:47:19,214
Everything you know,

3247
01:47:19,220 --> 01:47:20,210
memories,

3248
01:47:20,270 --> 01:47:21,530
people you talked to,

3249
01:47:21,531 --> 01:47:23,090
fragments of you know,

3250
01:47:23,460 --> 01:47:24,410
songs,

3251
01:47:24,440 --> 01:47:28,850
just whatever things are
swimming around in your head.

3252
01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:31,460
You sort of see they're all going into,

3253
01:47:31,490 --> 01:47:31,970
you know,

3254
01:47:31,970 --> 01:47:33,500
through this funnel or something.

3255
01:47:33,501 --> 01:47:38,501
Then it's coming out all a taped together
some way and that kind of a coherent

3256
01:47:38,991 --> 01:47:39,731
picture of,

3257
01:47:39,731 --> 01:47:40,580
of reality.

3258
01:47:40,581 --> 01:47:43,820
But DMT strips that back
and you get to step,

3259
01:47:43,880 --> 01:47:46,670
you get to see it from
the other side briefly,

3260
01:47:47,120 --> 01:47:47,810
how it's,

3261
01:47:47,810 --> 01:47:48,770
how it's working,

3262
01:47:48,771 --> 01:47:49,221
you know,

3263
01:47:49,221 --> 01:47:53,840
the reality generating
machine if you will.

3264
01:47:54,470 --> 01:47:56,210
That's what you see on DMT.

3265
01:47:56,690 --> 01:47:59,570
What is your thoughts or
what are your thoughts on,

3266
01:47:59,630 --> 01:48:00,080
uh,

3267
01:48:00,080 --> 01:48:04,040
alien abductions and Ufo experiences?

3268
01:48:04,041 --> 01:48:06,430
And do you think that these
are indogenous dumps of,

3269
01:48:06,431 --> 01:48:06,670
uh,

3270
01:48:06,670 --> 01:48:07,250
Dante,

3271
01:48:07,250 --> 01:48:11,570
that it's most likely what these people
were experiencing is some sort of a,

3272
01:48:11,580 --> 01:48:12,413
um,

3273
01:48:13,120 --> 01:48:14,360
well overflow or something,

3274
01:48:14,361 --> 01:48:14,871
you know,

3275
01:48:14,871 --> 01:48:14,960
a,

3276
01:48:14,960 --> 01:48:15,411
no,

3277
01:48:15,411 --> 01:48:16,041
I don't,

3278
01:48:16,041 --> 01:48:16,490
I mean,

3279
01:48:16,490 --> 01:48:19,010
I think that,

3280
01:48:19,760 --> 01:48:20,121
you know,

3281
01:48:20,121 --> 01:48:25,121
I think that Strassman's work on
this where high doses of DMT can

3282
01:48:27,360 --> 01:48:28,193
in,

3283
01:48:28,230 --> 01:48:29,063
you know,

3284
01:48:29,080 --> 01:48:31,870
in some people reliably induce these,

3285
01:48:31,900 --> 01:48:34,480
these abduction type in categories.

3286
01:48:34,481 --> 01:48:34,721
We'll,

3287
01:48:34,721 --> 01:48:34,991
we'd,

3288
01:48:34,991 --> 01:48:35,231
no,

3289
01:48:35,231 --> 01:48:36,064
they're not,

3290
01:48:36,300 --> 01:48:36,670
you know,

3291
01:48:36,670 --> 01:48:40,990
standing beside a highway in New
Mexico and watching it Ufo land.

3292
01:48:40,991 --> 01:48:42,640
They're in a hospital bed,

3293
01:48:42,900 --> 01:48:43,260
you know,

3294
01:48:43,260 --> 01:48:44,890
with an ivy installed,

3295
01:48:44,920 --> 01:48:47,380
but they're having these
types of experiences.

3296
01:48:47,470 --> 01:48:49,000
For those who don't know
what you're talking about,

3297
01:48:49,001 --> 01:48:50,590
it's Rick Strassman's work.

3298
01:48:50,591 --> 01:48:52,000
It's a book called DMT,

3299
01:48:52,001 --> 01:48:53,080
the spirit molecule.

3300
01:48:53,110 --> 01:48:54,610
It's all about the clinical studies,

3301
01:48:54,630 --> 01:48:55,150
right?

3302
01:48:55,150 --> 01:48:56,140
Things you did with TMT,

3303
01:48:56,170 --> 01:49:01,170
clinical studies with DMT at Straussman
reported that in many of his subjects

3304
01:49:01,960 --> 01:49:04,450
who are given high doses of DMT,

3305
01:49:04,480 --> 01:49:08,950
they had experiences that were similar,

3306
01:49:09,070 --> 01:49:14,070
if not identical to the classic
alien abduction type experience.

3307
01:49:15,301 --> 01:49:17,600
So then you do think that that's
what these people are having,

3308
01:49:17,630 --> 01:49:19,320
they're having indogenous
dumps while they're sleeping.

3309
01:49:19,370 --> 01:49:20,950
It's just something's
happening and that's,

3310
01:49:20,980 --> 01:49:21,671
no,

3311
01:49:21,671 --> 01:49:23,350
I think that not necessarily.

3312
01:49:23,351 --> 01:49:24,040
I think that,

3313
01:49:24,040 --> 01:49:25,110
I think that there,

3314
01:49:25,120 --> 01:49:30,120
I think that what DMT does is it lets
you poke your head temporarily into

3315
01:49:31,630 --> 01:49:32,710
another dimension.

3316
01:49:32,860 --> 01:49:35,740
So when these people are having
these UFO abduction experiences,

3317
01:49:35,741 --> 01:49:39,160
you think that other dimension is
poking his head into ours and yeah,

3318
01:49:39,161 --> 01:49:40,300
something like that.

3319
01:49:40,360 --> 01:49:44,140
So somehow the membrane
is Theon and you know,

3320
01:49:44,141 --> 01:49:46,120
whether it's you going there,

3321
01:49:46,130 --> 01:49:47,080
them going here,

3322
01:49:47,320 --> 01:49:47,861
there is,

3323
01:49:47,861 --> 01:49:48,161
you know,

3324
01:49:48,161 --> 01:49:48,580
there,

3325
01:49:48,580 --> 01:49:53,580
there are interfaces between
what we call ordinary reality,

3326
01:49:54,311 --> 01:49:56,200
which isn't ordinary at all.

3327
01:49:56,530 --> 01:49:59,310
And these other thesis
alternate realities.

3328
01:49:59,320 --> 01:50:02,440
And occasionally they come together,

3329
01:50:02,470 --> 01:50:02,801
you know,

3330
01:50:02,801 --> 01:50:07,801
and the membranes stretches and then
you get these types of interactions.

3331
01:50:08,770 --> 01:50:10,030
If that's true.

3332
01:50:10,031 --> 01:50:11,560
I mean if that's true,

3333
01:50:11,890 --> 01:50:12,460
uh,

3334
01:50:12,460 --> 01:50:12,940
that,

3335
01:50:12,940 --> 01:50:13,271
you know,

3336
01:50:13,271 --> 01:50:15,190
that model is,

3337
01:50:15,970 --> 01:50:16,510
you know,

3338
01:50:16,510 --> 01:50:18,100
the usual model of,

3339
01:50:18,130 --> 01:50:19,900
of experiences reductionist.

3340
01:50:19,901 --> 01:50:24,901
It's like the braveness generating all
of this and that's where it's coming

3341
01:50:25,181 --> 01:50:25,780
from.

3342
01:50:25,780 --> 01:50:26,740
And uh,

3343
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:28,353
you know,

3344
01:50:28,420 --> 01:50:32,380
everything we think we know about
the world is based on that premise.

3345
01:50:32,381 --> 01:50:34,240
If this other premise is true,

3346
01:50:34,570 --> 01:50:39,570
then we have to reexamine our most
fundamental assumptions about how it is,

3347
01:50:39,850 --> 01:50:40,211
you know,

3348
01:50:40,211 --> 01:50:41,680
how the world is

3349
01:50:43,880 --> 01:50:44,380
the um,

3350
01:50:44,380 --> 01:50:45,660
the issue isn't the,

3351
01:50:45,661 --> 01:50:46,461
isn't part of it though,

3352
01:50:46,461 --> 01:50:49,820
that all these abductions parents is a
good percentage of them happen at night.

3353
01:50:51,030 --> 01:50:52,040
They happen a lot of them.

3354
01:50:52,041 --> 01:50:52,890
All of these people aren't bad.

3355
01:50:52,920 --> 01:50:54,750
They're not happening
while people are like,

3356
01:50:54,760 --> 01:50:55,210
um,

3357
01:50:55,210 --> 01:50:56,940
Monday morning on the highway,

3358
01:50:57,040 --> 01:50:57,873
right to work,

3359
01:50:58,060 --> 01:50:59,610
happening while you're
supposed to be sleeping,

3360
01:50:59,611 --> 01:51:01,520
while your brain is producing
DMT in the first place.

3361
01:51:01,580 --> 01:51:02,100
Exact.

3362
01:51:02,100 --> 01:51:04,890
Do you think that the DMT could possibly,

3363
01:51:04,891 --> 01:51:06,360
I mean this is complete speculation,

3364
01:51:06,361 --> 01:51:10,530
but act as a doorway
where the actual real,

3365
01:51:10,531 --> 01:51:12,270
true entity can come through.

3366
01:51:12,420 --> 01:51:15,240
So these people that are having
these UFO abduction experiences,

3367
01:51:15,241 --> 01:51:17,100
even if they are still lying in their bed,

3368
01:51:17,280 --> 01:51:19,800
they are actually still
having this real experience.

3369
01:51:21,100 --> 01:51:21,341
Yeah,

3370
01:51:21,341 --> 01:51:22,174
I do.

3371
01:51:22,330 --> 01:51:22,750
I mean,

3372
01:51:22,750 --> 01:51:27,700
and if you talk to Sherman's people that
deliberately induce these states for

3373
01:51:27,701 --> 01:51:29,170
exactly this reason,

3374
01:51:29,200 --> 01:51:34,200
to communicate with these nonhuman
intelligences that give them useful

3375
01:51:35,201 --> 01:51:37,960
information about all kinds of things.

3376
01:51:38,270 --> 01:51:38,501
I mean,

3377
01:51:38,501 --> 01:51:41,590
the Shamans are just matter of
fact about it and they'll just say,

3378
01:51:41,591 --> 01:51:41,780
well,

3379
01:51:41,780 --> 01:51:41,960
yeah,

3380
01:51:41,960 --> 01:51:42,310
that,

3381
01:51:42,310 --> 01:51:43,870
what did you think it was?

3382
01:51:44,170 --> 01:51:45,003
You know,

3383
01:51:45,010 --> 01:51:49,000
this is the way reality is then
that that's where the cynics,

3384
01:51:49,001 --> 01:51:49,590
so he's coming like,

3385
01:51:49,590 --> 01:51:49,720
where,

3386
01:51:49,720 --> 01:51:50,740
where's this information?

3387
01:51:50,741 --> 01:51:51,740
What are you bringing back?

3388
01:51:51,741 --> 01:51:55,990
Can someone please bring back and
unsolvable equation that fast?

3389
01:51:55,991 --> 01:51:57,790
Maddix that's a tough one.

3390
01:51:57,820 --> 01:51:58,150
Yeah.

3391
01:51:58,150 --> 01:51:58,983
Yeah.

3392
01:51:59,360 --> 01:52:00,740
What do you think like that?

3393
01:52:00,970 --> 01:52:04,090
If you had a point to anything that's
been brought back from the Psychedelic,

3394
01:52:04,091 --> 01:52:04,590
you expect,

3395
01:52:04,590 --> 01:52:04,840
uh,

3396
01:52:04,840 --> 01:52:05,500
you know,

3397
01:52:05,500 --> 01:52:05,700
uh,

3398
01:52:05,700 --> 01:52:06,321
not the,

3399
01:52:06,321 --> 01:52:08,050
the Francis Crick thing that's disputed.

3400
01:52:08,051 --> 01:52:08,261
Right?

3401
01:52:08,261 --> 01:52:09,340
Whether or not Francis Crick,

3402
01:52:09,420 --> 01:52:14,080
you actually saw the double
helix while he was on Lsd.

3403
01:52:14,340 --> 01:52:14,521
Well,

3404
01:52:14,521 --> 01:52:18,460
he said that he did finally
death bed on his death bed.

3405
01:52:18,480 --> 01:52:19,710
There's no recording.

3406
01:52:19,711 --> 01:52:20,544
You know what I mean?

3407
01:52:21,240 --> 01:52:26,240
How much of that is just very Moelis
pcrs totally out front about his LSD

3408
01:52:27,931 --> 01:52:32,480
experiences contributed to
his insights about this ear.

3409
01:52:32,520 --> 01:52:32,940
Right.

3410
01:52:32,940 --> 01:52:36,270
It's difficult to measure
bringing something back.

3411
01:52:36,271 --> 01:52:36,790
I mean,

3412
01:52:36,790 --> 01:52:37,920
and Terrence was,

3413
01:52:38,430 --> 01:52:38,731
you know,

3414
01:52:38,731 --> 01:52:39,500
he,

3415
01:52:39,500 --> 01:52:39,670
he,

3416
01:52:39,670 --> 01:52:40,830
he has talked about this.

3417
01:52:40,831 --> 01:52:44,610
He used to what he was taking
mushrooms do exactly this,

3418
01:52:44,640 --> 01:52:46,340
get I thou

3419
01:52:46,400 --> 01:52:50,900
dialogue going with the
mushroom and you know,

3420
01:52:50,930 --> 01:52:55,760
insist that the mushroom tell him
something that he couldn't possibly know.

3421
01:52:56,630 --> 01:52:57,080
You know,

3422
01:52:57,080 --> 01:53:00,300
and the mushroom was
always very cagey about,

3423
01:53:00,830 --> 01:53:02,360
didn't cough it up.

3424
01:53:02,380 --> 01:53:03,170
But when you think,

3425
01:53:03,170 --> 01:53:05,040
well if I tell you that you won't need,

3426
01:53:05,600 --> 01:53:07,550
that sounds like the imagination to me.

3427
01:53:07,790 --> 01:53:09,230
I mean if I was the cynic I would say,

3428
01:53:09,231 --> 01:53:12,170
well that's obviously your imagination
then cause he can't concoct to anything

3429
01:53:12,171 --> 01:53:14,330
and it doesn't exist or something
you couldn't possibly know.

3430
01:53:14,331 --> 01:53:16,910
It doesn't have the resources because
it's coming from your own mind.

3431
01:53:17,120 --> 01:53:18,530
Well that would be,

3432
01:53:18,590 --> 01:53:19,970
that would be the criticism.

3433
01:53:20,210 --> 01:53:23,030
But then out of that
comes something like this,

3434
01:53:23,031 --> 01:53:24,320
the TimeWave zero.

3435
01:53:24,350 --> 01:53:24,720
I mean,

3436
01:53:24,720 --> 01:53:29,720
I would submit the time where zero was
an artifact from this other dimension,

3437
01:53:30,290 --> 01:53:33,350
but do we really understand what it was?

3438
01:53:33,351 --> 01:53:35,390
I mean it was a conceptual

3439
01:53:37,330 --> 01:53:39,400
artifact in a certain sense.

3440
01:53:39,401 --> 01:53:40,600
It was an idea.

3441
01:53:40,780 --> 01:53:43,480
So even certainly came from left field,

3442
01:53:43,810 --> 01:53:44,350
you know,

3443
01:53:44,350 --> 01:53:48,330
regardless of whether or not it
actually is some sort of a map of time.

3444
01:53:48,350 --> 01:53:51,160
It most certainly is a
13 lunar cycle calendar.

3445
01:53:51,360 --> 01:53:52,240
Well it certainly is.

3446
01:53:52,290 --> 01:53:57,160
That came from a psychedelic experience
that the knowledge of that essentially.

3447
01:53:57,170 --> 01:53:57,730
Yeah,

3448
01:53:57,730 --> 01:53:58,563
essentially.

3449
01:53:58,600 --> 01:53:59,081
So that's,

3450
01:53:59,081 --> 01:54:01,660
that seems to be something that
you can at least that aspect of it.

3451
01:54:01,840 --> 01:54:05,860
It seems very unfortunate that it's
connected with this idea of a map of time,

3452
01:54:05,861 --> 01:54:09,130
which makes people stick their nose up
in the air because if they just looked at

3453
01:54:09,131 --> 01:54:10,060
it for that,

3454
01:54:10,061 --> 01:54:10,491
just the,

3455
01:54:10,491 --> 01:54:11,710
the each thing being a,

3456
01:54:11,711 --> 01:54:11,980
um,

3457
01:54:11,980 --> 01:54:13,180
a calendar and an,

3458
01:54:13,181 --> 01:54:15,520
an a last calendar and
unleavened calendar.

3459
01:54:15,550 --> 01:54:18,880
Indisputably it's a calendar
or you can use it that way.

3460
01:54:18,881 --> 01:54:19,151
I mean,

3461
01:54:19,151 --> 01:54:23,590
the mathematics is clear as long as
you don't begin to postulate that this

3462
01:54:23,591 --> 01:54:24,424
actually,

3463
01:54:24,600 --> 01:54:24,940
you know,

3464
01:54:24,940 --> 01:54:26,920
describes the structure of time.

3465
01:54:27,160 --> 01:54:30,280
That's where I have a problem
with it because for one thing,

3466
01:54:30,310 --> 01:54:30,820
you know,

3467
01:54:30,820 --> 01:54:35,820
TimeWave zero completely
ignores relativity and all
the aspects of time that go

3468
01:54:37,811 --> 01:54:38,650
into that.

3469
01:54:38,651 --> 01:54:40,640
So you know how cell,

3470
01:54:41,830 --> 01:54:42,170
well,

3471
01:54:42,170 --> 01:54:43,510
it claims that,

3472
01:54:43,511 --> 01:54:44,140
you know,

3473
01:54:44,140 --> 01:54:44,520
uh,

3474
01:54:44,520 --> 01:54:46,330
if claims that this

3475
01:54:47,700 --> 01:54:51,780
map of time describes the
structure of time everywhere,

3476
01:54:52,290 --> 01:54:53,070
you know,

3477
01:54:53,070 --> 01:54:54,810
in all parts of the universe,

3478
01:54:54,811 --> 01:54:59,490
but we know from relativity that it
all depends on the reference frame.

3479
01:54:59,700 --> 01:55:00,150
Right.

3480
01:55:00,150 --> 01:55:00,960
So,

3481
01:55:00,960 --> 01:55:01,530
you know,

3482
01:55:01,530 --> 01:55:05,940
so it's not clear ship
traveling speed of light,

3483
01:55:05,941 --> 01:55:09,570
someone aboard it experiences time at a
different level and it's given on earth

3484
01:55:09,571 --> 01:55:10,111
different way.

3485
01:55:10,111 --> 01:55:11,070
How do you con side that,

3486
01:55:11,071 --> 01:55:11,341
how did,

3487
01:55:11,341 --> 01:55:11,790
how did the,

3488
01:55:11,790 --> 01:55:12,301
how do they call it?

3489
01:55:12,301 --> 01:55:13,470
Can't reconcile.

3490
01:55:13,590 --> 01:55:15,240
It just doesn't account for it,

3491
01:55:15,390 --> 01:55:16,080
you know?

3492
01:55:16,080 --> 01:55:16,351
I mean,

3493
01:55:16,351 --> 01:55:20,180
the problem with the TimeWave to stay
up for this conversation that the,

3494
01:55:21,620 --> 01:55:23,000
I'm trying to wrap my
head around it while,

3495
01:55:23,360 --> 01:55:25,620
while we're talking
about the TimeWave in my,

3496
01:55:25,680 --> 01:55:26,760
in my opinion,

3497
01:55:26,820 --> 01:55:29,610
is that it's not,

3498
01:55:29,670 --> 01:55:31,540
it can't be disproved.

3499
01:55:32,330 --> 01:55:33,420
Neither can Jesus.

3500
01:55:34,630 --> 01:55:35,463
And so,

3501
01:55:35,590 --> 01:55:35,860
right.

3502
01:55:35,860 --> 01:55:37,090
Science can't disprove anything.

3503
01:55:37,690 --> 01:55:39,100
Science can't disapprove.

3504
01:55:39,130 --> 01:55:39,341
Well,

3505
01:55:39,341 --> 01:55:39,611
yeah,

3506
01:55:39,611 --> 01:55:41,500
science can disapprove things.

3507
01:55:41,530 --> 01:55:42,660
They can't prove it.

3508
01:55:42,680 --> 01:55:43,620
Not unique events.

3509
01:55:43,621 --> 01:55:43,831
Right?

3510
01:55:43,831 --> 01:55:45,240
That unique events happened.

3511
01:55:45,970 --> 01:55:47,040
The other words,

3512
01:55:47,070 --> 01:55:47,910
in other words,

3513
01:55:48,030 --> 01:55:52,440
Terence or whoever created the
TimeWave theory never defined,

3514
01:55:52,800 --> 01:55:56,340
these are the criteria that
will invalidate this theory,

3515
01:55:56,370 --> 01:55:56,790
right?

3516
01:55:56,790 --> 01:55:59,310
And science depends on,

3517
01:55:59,670 --> 01:56:01,620
in order to qualify as a theory,

3518
01:56:01,650 --> 01:56:04,230
you have to say what's
going to invalidate it?

3519
01:56:04,290 --> 01:56:05,123
What is,

3520
01:56:05,340 --> 01:56:05,580
you know,

3521
01:56:05,580 --> 01:56:07,070
what are the criteria that's going to

3522
01:56:08,250 --> 01:56:11,520
take the foundations out
from under this theory?

3523
01:56:11,521 --> 01:56:16,020
That either means you have to chuck the
theory completely or you have to modify

3524
01:56:16,021 --> 01:56:16,854
it.

3525
01:56:16,980 --> 01:56:19,560
So the model fits the data better.

3526
01:56:19,590 --> 01:56:20,131
Right?

3527
01:56:20,131 --> 01:56:20,671
And,

3528
01:56:20,671 --> 01:56:21,030
uh,

3529
01:56:21,030 --> 01:56:22,740
he was never able to,

3530
01:56:22,741 --> 01:56:25,430
or he'd never did.

3531
01:56:25,440 --> 01:56:30,240
And I don't think he was really able to
define what would invalidate the theory.

3532
01:56:30,241 --> 01:56:31,950
So it's an untestable theory.

3533
01:56:31,980 --> 01:56:33,360
So it's not a theory.

3534
01:56:34,200 --> 01:56:35,880
So it's just an idea.

3535
01:56:35,881 --> 01:56:37,260
It's an interesting idea,

3536
01:56:37,261 --> 01:56:38,520
but it isn't the theory.

3537
01:56:38,521 --> 01:56:40,440
It's not something you can disapprove.

3538
01:56:42,030 --> 01:56:43,470
And so it's,

3539
01:56:44,990 --> 01:56:46,370
it's useful as an idea,

3540
01:56:46,371 --> 01:56:47,000
but it's,

3541
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:50,030
but in some ways it's not.

3542
01:56:50,090 --> 01:56:50,511
I mean,

3543
01:56:50,511 --> 01:56:50,871
you know,

3544
01:56:50,871 --> 01:56:51,441
you've got,

3545
01:56:51,441 --> 01:56:53,060
if you want it to be scientific,

3546
01:56:53,061 --> 01:56:56,450
if you want to call this a
theory in the scientific sense,

3547
01:56:56,451 --> 01:56:57,980
you have to define what's gonna,

3548
01:56:58,160 --> 01:56:59,630
what's gonna disapprove it,

3549
01:56:59,780 --> 01:57:00,201
what I meant,

3550
01:57:00,201 --> 01:57:01,910
the science can't disprove
things when I met as,

3551
01:57:01,911 --> 01:57:04,280
I can't disprove like
really unique events,

3552
01:57:04,281 --> 01:57:08,180
like the idea of a Ufo actually existing
and then disappearing like once it's

3553
01:57:08,181 --> 01:57:08,841
here in God.

3554
01:57:08,841 --> 01:57:10,010
If there's no physical evidence,

3555
01:57:10,011 --> 01:57:10,401
if there's not,

3556
01:57:10,401 --> 01:57:10,611
I mean,

3557
01:57:10,611 --> 01:57:11,270
how do you,

3558
01:57:11,270 --> 01:57:14,390
how can you disprove a
unique event like that?

3559
01:57:14,720 --> 01:57:15,321
But when you,

3560
01:57:15,321 --> 01:57:15,531
well,

3561
01:57:15,531 --> 01:57:15,790
yeah,

3562
01:57:15,790 --> 01:57:16,040
you,

3563
01:57:16,040 --> 01:57:16,940
you don't,

3564
01:57:17,480 --> 01:57:18,470
you don't,

3565
01:57:18,530 --> 01:57:20,600
I mean that the doesn't mean
they don't exist though.

3566
01:57:20,930 --> 01:57:21,320
Right.

3567
01:57:21,320 --> 01:57:22,310
They do exist.

3568
01:57:22,311 --> 01:57:23,144
Sure.

3569
01:57:23,870 --> 01:57:25,060
Something makes is,

3570
01:57:25,610 --> 01:57:25,971
I mean,

3571
01:57:25,971 --> 01:57:28,630
I always thought that what Jl Heineke,

3572
01:57:28,830 --> 01:57:30,720
the UFO researcher,

3573
01:57:30,740 --> 01:57:33,770
famous Ufo researcher
said about Ufo as he said,

3574
01:57:34,070 --> 01:57:37,460
I don't know if you have
photos are real or not,

3575
01:57:37,520 --> 01:57:42,520
but I know absolutely 100%
that Ufo experiences are real.

3576
01:57:44,290 --> 01:57:45,210
Hmm.

3577
01:57:45,500 --> 01:57:46,850
And that's the data.

3578
01:57:46,851 --> 01:57:50,120
That's the data that
you have to investigate.

3579
01:57:50,540 --> 01:57:51,021
I think that,

3580
01:57:51,021 --> 01:57:53,300
I think that's a very
perceptive thing to say.

3581
01:57:53,360 --> 01:57:54,530
Especially coming from him.

3582
01:57:54,550 --> 01:57:54,851
Yeah.

3583
01:57:54,851 --> 01:57:56,630
He's coming from Jay on.

3584
01:57:56,680 --> 01:57:58,730
Nick was a guy who actually
worked for operation.

3585
01:57:58,770 --> 01:58:00,590
We're project Blue Book and uh,

3586
01:58:00,620 --> 01:58:01,071
he was,

3587
01:58:01,071 --> 01:58:01,904
uh,

3588
01:58:01,910 --> 01:58:05,660
assigned by the government to go and
research different UFO sightings.

3589
01:58:05,661 --> 01:58:07,520
And somewhere along the line he cited,

3590
01:58:07,521 --> 01:58:08,001
listen man,

3591
01:58:08,001 --> 01:58:08,990
I'm going to just do this.

3592
01:58:09,260 --> 01:58:10,520
And he stopped working for the government.

3593
01:58:10,521 --> 01:58:13,190
It just started spending all
of his time researching Ufo.

3594
01:58:13,280 --> 01:58:14,360
He was absolutely convinced.

3595
01:58:14,361 --> 01:58:19,361
He was always clear that what he was
investigated where Ufo experiences because

3596
01:58:19,851 --> 01:58:23,630
that was the data that
he had to work with,

3597
01:58:23,810 --> 01:58:24,290
you know,

3598
01:58:24,290 --> 01:58:28,790
and that's absolutely 100% true.

3599
01:58:28,820 --> 01:58:31,070
Ufo experiences do occur,

3600
01:58:31,071 --> 01:58:32,060
whether those are

3601
01:58:34,230 --> 01:58:35,940
confabulation of,

3602
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:36,331
you know,

3603
01:58:36,331 --> 01:58:38,040
the mind or whether they're,

3604
01:58:38,070 --> 01:58:38,903
you know,

3605
01:58:38,970 --> 01:58:41,480
whether they're extra terrestrial origin,

3606
01:58:41,500 --> 01:58:42,430
extra dimensional.

3607
01:58:42,480 --> 01:58:43,060
Laura,

3608
01:58:43,060 --> 01:58:45,160
I don't think we can really say,

3609
01:58:45,540 --> 01:58:49,290
did you ever have any
sort of alien experience?

3610
01:58:49,291 --> 01:58:52,950
Did you ever have any sort of
extra terrestrial physical contact?

3611
01:58:54,290 --> 01:58:55,123
Um,

3612
01:58:57,260 --> 01:58:57,980
no,

3613
01:58:57,980 --> 01:58:59,420
I can't say I have,

3614
01:58:59,840 --> 01:59:00,390
you know,

3615
01:59:00,390 --> 01:59:00,980
um,

3616
01:59:00,980 --> 01:59:03,230
other than being smeared
over the entire universe.

3617
01:59:03,380 --> 01:59:03,561
Yeah.

3618
01:59:03,561 --> 01:59:04,220
But that was,

3619
01:59:04,220 --> 01:59:05,053
that was,

3620
01:59:06,240 --> 01:59:06,830
that was,

3621
01:59:06,830 --> 01:59:08,960
that was saying it was
extra terrestrial but,

3622
01:59:09,290 --> 01:59:11,740
but Terrence did you
know at lunch Herrera,

3623
01:59:11,780 --> 01:59:12,613
he did.

3624
01:59:12,860 --> 01:59:15,170
Of course there was no
one else to witness this.

3625
01:59:15,200 --> 01:59:15,800
Right.

3626
01:59:15,800 --> 01:59:18,350
And I write about that in the book.

3627
01:59:18,351 --> 01:59:23,351
I actually quote at length the section
from a true hallucinations in which he

3628
01:59:24,351 --> 01:59:25,520
describes this.

3629
01:59:26,380 --> 01:59:27,530
And I have no doubt,

3630
01:59:27,531 --> 01:59:29,480
I don't doubt that it took place.

3631
01:59:29,510 --> 01:59:29,841
I mean,

3632
01:59:29,841 --> 01:59:33,830
there was all sorts of anomalous
things taking place a lot.

3633
01:59:33,831 --> 01:59:34,320
Sure.

3634
01:59:34,320 --> 01:59:34,891
And then again,

3635
01:59:34,891 --> 01:59:39,420
it goes back to the fact that you guys
were ingesting the most incredible

3636
01:59:39,540 --> 01:59:41,760
silicide mushrooms every day.

3637
01:59:41,790 --> 01:59:42,623
All Day.

3638
01:59:42,890 --> 01:59:43,460
I mean,

3639
01:59:43,460 --> 01:59:44,090
but,

3640
01:59:44,090 --> 01:59:49,090
but the really interesting stuff didn't
start until after we've stopped that.

3641
01:59:50,100 --> 01:59:50,251
Well,

3642
01:59:50,251 --> 01:59:51,630
even after he stopped that though,

3643
01:59:51,631 --> 01:59:54,000
how much of that shit was still
floating around in your head?

3644
01:59:54,001 --> 01:59:54,241
I mean,

3645
01:59:54,241 --> 01:59:56,670
you guys were talking
about crazy quantities.

3646
01:59:56,840 --> 01:59:57,673
Are you to say,

3647
01:59:57,690 --> 01:59:59,020
did you ever sober up?

3648
01:59:59,050 --> 02:00:00,420
I still high from that.

3649
02:00:01,090 --> 02:00:04,590
Substances are still high from
it because that experience,

3650
02:00:04,591 --> 02:00:05,424
you'd never,

3651
02:00:05,610 --> 02:00:05,890
you know,

3652
02:00:05,890 --> 02:00:07,280
you're always integrating it.

3653
02:00:07,320 --> 02:00:07,591
I mean,

3654
02:00:07,591 --> 02:00:09,540
it's rather strange to me that,

3655
02:00:10,200 --> 02:00:10,980
you know,

3656
02:00:10,980 --> 02:00:15,980
it's like that was 1971
so that was 40 years ago.

3657
02:00:17,400 --> 02:00:20,760
And one of the more interesting
things that Terence said about,

3658
02:00:20,800 --> 02:00:21,440
uh,

3659
02:00:21,440 --> 02:00:21,990
siliciden,

3660
02:00:21,990 --> 02:00:25,170
which was a real mind
blower was first of all,

3661
02:00:25,171 --> 02:00:30,171
how closely it relates to normal human
neurochemistry is that silicide been,

3662
02:00:31,411 --> 02:00:36,411
is like almost exactly the
same as chemicals that are
on brain produces and very

3663
02:00:37,621 --> 02:00:39,270
alien in that form,

3664
02:00:39,480 --> 02:00:41,250
that form the form that it exists.

3665
02:00:41,251 --> 02:00:43,950
Whatever the molecule
structure of suicide of it is,

3666
02:00:43,951 --> 02:00:46,380
it's the only similar,

3667
02:00:46,550 --> 02:00:48,720
the way it exists it,

3668
02:00:48,750 --> 02:00:52,950
there's not something similar to it or
there's not something like it that exists

3669
02:00:52,951 --> 02:00:54,800
in the organic world other than a

3670
02:00:55,510 --> 02:00:56,343
chemistry.

3671
02:00:56,410 --> 02:00:56,981
Yeah.

3672
02:00:56,981 --> 02:00:58,690
Well that's not quite true,

3673
02:00:58,691 --> 02:01:01,900
but I think what he was trying to
say that it's silicide button is,

3674
02:01:02,200 --> 02:01:04,930
is only found in the fungal kingdom.

3675
02:01:05,060 --> 02:01:05,381
Right.

3676
02:01:05,381 --> 02:01:06,071
As far as we know,

3677
02:01:06,071 --> 02:01:08,090
it's never been found in a higher plan.

3678
02:01:08,180 --> 02:01:13,180
Although lots of tryptamines DMT is
all over the place and a lot of mess

3679
02:01:14,200 --> 02:01:14,921
derivatives.

3680
02:01:14,921 --> 02:01:19,921
But psilocybin and Silversun do not occur
as far as we know outside the fungal

3681
02:01:20,981 --> 02:01:21,461
world,

3682
02:01:21,461 --> 02:01:23,530
outside the world of mushrooms.

3683
02:01:23,531 --> 02:01:25,780
Why that should be hard to say.

3684
02:01:25,810 --> 02:01:30,190
Maybe it will be discovered in a
higher plant tomorrow or next week,

3685
02:01:30,191 --> 02:01:31,510
but I kind of doubt it.

3686
02:01:32,230 --> 02:01:33,063
Uh,

3687
02:01:33,250 --> 02:01:34,270
you know,

3688
02:01:34,550 --> 02:01:34,980
uh,

3689
02:01:34,980 --> 02:01:37,660
I don't want to get too
much into the chemistry,

3690
02:01:37,661 --> 02:01:39,040
but I do think,

3691
02:01:39,380 --> 02:01:40,580
I think that,

3692
02:01:41,120 --> 02:01:41,480
you know,

3693
02:01:41,480 --> 02:01:41,811
this,

3694
02:01:41,811 --> 02:01:43,370
this touches on another,

3695
02:01:43,940 --> 02:01:44,570
you know,

3696
02:01:44,570 --> 02:01:46,160
remarkable aspect of,

3697
02:01:46,190 --> 02:01:47,390
of our universe,

3698
02:01:47,391 --> 02:01:47,720
of,

3699
02:01:47,720 --> 02:01:48,860
of uh,

3700
02:01:48,890 --> 02:01:51,050
biological being,

3701
02:01:51,051 --> 02:01:55,940
which is that these tryptamines
DMT five methoxy DMT,

3702
02:01:55,941 --> 02:01:56,774
Bufo,

3703
02:01:56,970 --> 02:02:01,970
silicide and Silversun DMT itself
as two steps from Tryptofan,

3704
02:02:03,320 --> 02:02:03,950
right?

3705
02:02:03,950 --> 02:02:06,890
Tryptophan is an amino
acid that is universal.

3706
02:02:06,891 --> 02:02:09,580
It's part of the 20 that go into proteins.

3707
02:02:09,581 --> 02:02:12,470
So it's an essential molecule of life.

3708
02:02:12,471 --> 02:02:17,471
Tryptofan is the molecule are the
enzymes that convert Tryptofan to DMT.

3709
02:02:18,710 --> 02:02:21,140
There are two primary enzymes,

3710
02:02:21,230 --> 02:02:22,063
a

3711
02:02:24,050 --> 02:02:27,260
amino acid decarboxylase
aromatic amino acid,

3712
02:02:27,261 --> 02:02:29,830
decarboxylase and methyltransferases,

3713
02:02:29,870 --> 02:02:31,340
what they're call called.

3714
02:02:32,090 --> 02:02:34,640
I don't know if your
audience cares about this,

3715
02:02:34,641 --> 02:02:39,641
but the point is too trivial
steps from tryptofan leads to DMT,

3716
02:02:40,200 --> 02:02:40,850
right?

3717
02:02:40,850 --> 02:02:42,800
And so DMT,

3718
02:02:44,090 --> 02:02:44,480
you know,

3719
02:02:44,480 --> 02:02:44,780
the,

3720
02:02:44,780 --> 02:02:45,111
the,

3721
02:02:45,111 --> 02:02:49,910
the biosphere is saturated with DMT.

3722
02:02:50,150 --> 02:02:52,610
It's not an uncommon chemical at all.

3723
02:02:52,640 --> 02:02:55,760
It's found in probably
thousands of plants.

3724
02:02:55,761 --> 02:02:58,640
It's found in animals
that's filed in fungi.

3725
02:02:58,670 --> 02:02:59,780
It's everywhere.

3726
02:03:00,470 --> 02:03:01,730
I think it's interesting.

3727
02:03:01,740 --> 02:03:04,550
I don't know what it
means except you know,

3728
02:03:04,580 --> 02:03:06,590
stepping away from science for a minute,

3729
02:03:06,591 --> 02:03:07,401
strict science,

3730
02:03:07,401 --> 02:03:12,401
but thinking maybe this is a kind of a
subtle message that nature is trying to

3731
02:03:14,450 --> 02:03:15,980
send to the monkeys.

3732
02:03:16,290 --> 02:03:17,730
So that's why DMTs everywhere.

3733
02:03:17,731 --> 02:03:17,941
Yeah.

3734
02:03:17,941 --> 02:03:18,751
Look guys,

3735
02:03:18,751 --> 02:03:20,400
just look around the corner,

3736
02:03:20,401 --> 02:03:20,680
right?

3737
02:03:20,680 --> 02:03:22,590
It's all waiting for you.

3738
02:03:22,591 --> 02:03:23,610
It's all there.

3739
02:03:23,640 --> 02:03:26,460
If I remember one time I
said was what he found fast.

3740
02:03:26,490 --> 02:03:27,091
It was a,

3741
02:03:27,091 --> 02:03:31,430
what he was alluding to was that
silicide and may have come here and uh,

3742
02:03:32,040 --> 02:03:34,650
from an asteroid that it
could survive in a vacuum.

3743
02:03:34,651 --> 02:03:35,520
And He,

3744
02:03:35,990 --> 02:03:37,410
I think it was,

3745
02:03:37,411 --> 02:03:37,860
um,

3746
02:03:37,860 --> 02:03:38,820
the phosphorous,

3747
02:03:38,821 --> 02:03:41,070
I believe in the four
position describing the,

3748
02:03:41,071 --> 02:03:42,650
the molecular structure of suicide,

3749
02:03:42,910 --> 02:03:45,900
suicide and its
phosphorolated form position.

3750
02:03:45,990 --> 02:03:46,441
As you said,

3751
02:03:46,441 --> 02:03:49,710
it was the only thing that was like that.

3752
02:03:49,711 --> 02:03:50,060
Is that right?

3753
02:03:50,060 --> 02:03:52,580
It's the only one we found so far.

3754
02:03:52,581 --> 02:03:57,170
It's the only phosphorylated in
Dole that we found in nature.

3755
02:03:57,200 --> 02:04:00,980
Well that and some close derivatives
which also occur in them.

3756
02:04:00,981 --> 02:04:01,310
Yeah.

3757
02:04:01,310 --> 02:04:04,400
Does that make any sense then that
that could have possibly come here?

3758
02:04:04,401 --> 02:04:06,280
We know that what it's
called Pennsbury as a,

3759
02:04:06,281 --> 02:04:09,020
how they just have the sperm
Mia Panspermia is how the,

3760
02:04:09,021 --> 02:04:12,200
they believe that amino
acids and essential building
blocks from life may have

3761
02:04:12,201 --> 02:04:13,610
traveled here from asteroids.

3762
02:04:13,790 --> 02:04:16,580
And that may be how life
was seated on this planet or

3763
02:04:16,650 --> 02:04:21,270
I mean I suggest in the book actually
people have to read the book because they

3764
02:04:21,300 --> 02:04:23,420
have to kind of unpack this.

3765
02:04:23,421 --> 02:04:28,421
I actually have a section in the book
called reflections on Lunch Herrera.

3766
02:04:28,790 --> 02:04:30,080
And I,

3767
02:04:30,140 --> 02:04:30,560
uh,

3768
02:04:30,560 --> 02:04:31,580
trying to,

3769
02:04:32,270 --> 02:04:34,310
not only I'm it for the reader,

3770
02:04:34,311 --> 02:04:38,430
but try and look at it myself
from the standpoint of 40 years

3771
02:04:38,460 --> 02:04:39,293
Hanse,

3772
02:04:39,490 --> 02:04:39,810
you know,

3773
02:04:39,810 --> 02:04:44,640
after the experience and say what
was going on and what makes sense.

3774
02:04:44,641 --> 02:04:46,800
And what might've been going on was,

3775
02:04:46,970 --> 02:04:48,510
was it simply to,

3776
02:04:49,180 --> 02:04:49,650
you know,

3777
02:04:49,650 --> 02:04:52,290
nerdy guys who went to the Amazon,

3778
02:04:52,291 --> 02:04:57,291
took too many drugs and m had these
experiences and that end of story or was

3779
02:04:58,681 --> 02:05:00,600
there really something else going on?

3780
02:05:00,601 --> 02:05:04,590
And the whole issue touches
on what we were talking about,

3781
02:05:04,591 --> 02:05:09,591
about the evolutionary potential
evolutionary significance of mushrooms.

3782
02:05:09,781 --> 02:05:14,760
I mean it may be that what
we are is a million year,

3783
02:05:14,910 --> 02:05:19,910
multimillion year long
biotechnologies a essentially where,

3784
02:05:22,740 --> 02:05:23,340
you know,

3785
02:05:23,340 --> 02:05:28,340
if a super technological civilization
biotechnological civilization with plenty

3786
02:05:30,781 --> 02:05:34,140
of time on its hands in
a certain perspective,

3787
02:05:34,440 --> 02:05:39,440
if they wanted to take an ecology and
see what happened when they see did these

3788
02:05:40,531 --> 02:05:42,660
molecules into the ecology,

3789
02:05:43,280 --> 02:05:43,830
you know,

3790
02:05:43,830 --> 02:05:47,360
and then watched it unfold.

3791
02:05:47,380 --> 02:05:47,671
Do you know,

3792
02:05:47,671 --> 02:05:52,140
perhaps manipulating
the way things unfolded.

3793
02:05:52,490 --> 02:05:52,700
They,

3794
02:05:52,700 --> 02:05:53,730
it's almost like,

3795
02:05:53,760 --> 02:05:54,240
you know,

3796
02:05:54,240 --> 02:05:55,560
they wanted to,

3797
02:05:56,700 --> 02:05:57,230
okay,

3798
02:05:57,230 --> 02:06:02,230
kind of I guess create the conditions
where intelligence and consciousness could

3799
02:06:02,991 --> 02:06:07,991
arise and then see what the effects
were in a certain sample media style pro

3800
02:06:09,021 --> 02:06:09,950
Mithias style.

3801
02:06:09,980 --> 02:06:12,660
Although prometheus's we all agree was

3802
02:06:12,770 --> 02:06:13,610
pretty lame.

3803
02:06:14,330 --> 02:06:17,720
But something like that you
said at first something,

3804
02:06:17,721 --> 02:06:18,610
something along that,

3805
02:06:18,670 --> 02:06:19,640
those lines.

3806
02:06:19,641 --> 02:06:24,641
So you know where if you seed the
ecology with Tryptofan and the enzymes,

3807
02:06:25,451 --> 02:06:26,350
then this,

3808
02:06:26,380 --> 02:06:29,740
this thing is going to
be all over the place.

3809
02:06:29,770 --> 02:06:30,820
And then,

3810
02:06:31,660 --> 02:06:32,280
you know,

3811
02:06:32,280 --> 02:06:36,850
I'm probably predate the appearance
of complex nervous systems.

3812
02:06:37,570 --> 02:06:39,280
But you know,

3813
02:06:39,310 --> 02:06:40,840
we know for example,

3814
02:06:40,841 --> 02:06:45,841
that the serotonin receptors
are evolutionarily the
oldest receptors that we'd

3815
02:06:46,961 --> 02:06:49,540
known the oldest
neurotransmitter receptors.

3816
02:06:49,990 --> 02:06:50,823
So,

3817
02:06:54,200 --> 02:06:54,350
uh,

3818
02:06:54,350 --> 02:06:54,681
well,

3819
02:06:54,681 --> 02:06:55,370
I don't know,

3820
02:06:55,370 --> 02:06:58,520
I mean it's tempting to speculate on this.

3821
02:06:58,550 --> 02:06:59,930
It's very sexy to,

3822
02:06:59,960 --> 02:07:00,800
it's sexy.

3823
02:07:00,801 --> 02:07:05,801
It's comforting in a certain way to
think there is actually an overlord that

3824
02:07:08,101 --> 02:07:11,330
south their CD and intelligence
throughout the galaxy.

3825
02:07:11,331 --> 02:07:11,631
I mean,

3826
02:07:11,631 --> 02:07:12,560
what a cool idea.

3827
02:07:12,590 --> 02:07:14,810
But you yourself knowing
so much about biology,

3828
02:07:14,811 --> 02:07:19,040
looking at the complex processes that
occur on this planet that are completely,

3829
02:07:19,550 --> 02:07:22,670
I wouldn't say they're
orchestrated by nature,

3830
02:07:22,820 --> 02:07:23,680
but like this,

3831
02:07:23,720 --> 02:07:25,310
the parasitic relationships,

3832
02:07:25,311 --> 02:07:27,120
they're really complex ones that eh,

3833
02:07:27,260 --> 02:07:29,960
parasites have with
like the aquatic water.

3834
02:07:30,100 --> 02:07:34,130
A worm that gets inside of a grasshopper
grows then convinces the grasshopper to

3835
02:07:34,131 --> 02:07:36,780
commit suicide so it can
be born into the water.

3836
02:07:37,010 --> 02:07:37,170
I mean,

3837
02:07:37,170 --> 02:07:40,050
we know about these weird
crazy relationships that exist.

3838
02:07:40,080 --> 02:07:40,440
Right?

3839
02:07:40,440 --> 02:07:41,273
Exactly.

3840
02:07:42,650 --> 02:07:43,140
So,

3841
02:07:43,140 --> 02:07:43,800
well,

3842
02:07:43,800 --> 02:07:46,260
but this is a kind of an example of that,

3843
02:07:46,261 --> 02:07:46,530
right?

3844
02:07:46,530 --> 02:07:48,060
On the galactic scale.

3845
02:07:48,090 --> 02:07:48,923
Exactly.

3846
02:07:49,230 --> 02:07:49,620
You know,

3847
02:07:49,620 --> 02:07:49,880
if,

3848
02:07:49,880 --> 02:07:54,880
if there are fungi in nature and actually
your cordyceps in years supplement is

3849
02:07:56,461 --> 02:07:57,330
exactly that.

3850
02:07:57,330 --> 02:07:57,691
You know,

3851
02:07:57,691 --> 02:07:58,800
it's biology,

3852
02:07:59,400 --> 02:07:59,910
you know,

3853
02:07:59,910 --> 02:08:01,560
it grows on caterpillars.

3854
02:08:01,561 --> 02:08:02,394
There are,

3855
02:08:02,490 --> 02:08:07,490
there are some species that will grow
on ants and you probably heard how they

3856
02:08:07,621 --> 02:08:08,070
work.

3857
02:08:08,070 --> 02:08:11,160
They will infect the
APP at a certain point,

3858
02:08:11,610 --> 02:08:12,780
the Haas Storia,

3859
02:08:12,781 --> 02:08:14,940
they will put these mycelium,

3860
02:08:15,420 --> 02:08:20,420
mycelium will affect the amps sprain and
trigger it to go from the base of the

3861
02:08:22,681 --> 02:08:25,200
leaf of the blade of grass to the tip.

3862
02:08:26,130 --> 02:08:29,050
Then it will kill it and parallel.

3863
02:08:29,051 --> 02:08:29,881
Oh right.

3864
02:08:29,881 --> 02:08:30,450
And then,

3865
02:08:30,450 --> 02:08:32,100
and then it can sporulate right.

3866
02:08:32,140 --> 02:08:34,380
It will overgrow the body
and released the spores,

3867
02:08:34,381 --> 02:08:39,381
but it's induced the hand to go from
the least optimal place to distribute

3868
02:08:39,511 --> 02:08:41,220
spores to the most optimal,

3869
02:08:41,400 --> 02:08:42,000
credible.

3870
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:43,010
So it's controlled.

3871
02:08:43,350 --> 02:08:44,183
So that,

3872
02:08:44,190 --> 02:08:46,470
that's a phenomenon that's
an intelligent nature.

3873
02:08:46,500 --> 02:08:46,771
Yeah.

3874
02:08:46,771 --> 02:08:48,960
So kind of intense spreading intelligence.

3875
02:08:48,961 --> 02:08:53,961
So why is it so far fetched to
think that there is a galactic,

3876
02:08:54,060 --> 02:08:54,810
you know,

3877
02:08:54,810 --> 02:08:55,410
uh,

3878
02:08:55,410 --> 02:08:57,720
super race or maybe it's,

3879
02:08:58,530 --> 02:08:59,100
you know,

3880
02:08:59,100 --> 02:09:00,480
that infects,

3881
02:09:00,630 --> 02:09:01,260
you know,

3882
02:09:01,260 --> 02:09:06,260
complex nervous systems when they be busy
in our ecology that that then induces

3883
02:09:07,411 --> 02:09:07,981
us to,

3884
02:09:07,981 --> 02:09:08,640
you know,

3885
02:09:08,640 --> 02:09:13,640
invent culture and language and technology
and eventually build star ships and

3886
02:09:14,550 --> 02:09:18,900
get off this bud and do what they're
doing and do what they're continuing the,

3887
02:09:19,030 --> 02:09:22,140
the most advanced form of uh,

3888
02:09:23,090 --> 02:09:25,150
like forming life and other places.

3889
02:09:25,170 --> 02:09:25,620
Yeah.

3890
02:09:25,620 --> 02:09:28,360
Maybe or might maybe just
also just could be that.

3891
02:09:28,361 --> 02:09:30,450
So I mean this is getting so far out.

3892
02:09:30,451 --> 02:09:31,610
We should probably add the,

3893
02:09:34,080 --> 02:09:39,080
we went as far down the what if ladder
galactic overlord sending spaceships

3894
02:09:39,180 --> 02:09:40,200
filled with mushrooms.

3895
02:09:41,670 --> 02:09:41,941
Yeah,

3896
02:09:41,941 --> 02:09:42,510
that's,

3897
02:09:42,510 --> 02:09:43,910
that's like next top crazy.

3898
02:09:44,400 --> 02:09:45,030
I remember

3899
02:09:45,030 --> 02:09:45,863
what I mean.

3900
02:09:45,870 --> 02:09:47,430
This seems to remember that we exist.

3901
02:09:47,431 --> 02:09:50,130
You have to remember that we're putting
a rover on Mars and taking photographs

3902
02:09:50,131 --> 02:09:55,131
and possibly contaminating how unlikely
this whole thing is that we should even

3903
02:09:55,620 --> 02:09:56,453
be here.

3904
02:09:56,530 --> 02:10:01,530
I mean one of Terrence's favorite
phrases and I think it's true.

3905
02:10:02,431 --> 02:10:05,190
We should always remember
what JBS health aide said.

3906
02:10:05,310 --> 02:10:05,670
You know,

3907
02:10:05,670 --> 02:10:10,670
the universe is not only stranger than
you suppose it's stranger than you can

3908
02:10:10,981 --> 02:10:11,820
suppose.

3909
02:10:11,821 --> 02:10:12,571
I love that quote.

3910
02:10:12,571 --> 02:10:16,230
And I love that he used to
say queer because that's
what [inaudible] said it was

3911
02:10:16,231 --> 02:10:16,771
going to say,

3912
02:10:16,771 --> 02:10:18,240
actually he said Queer,

3913
02:10:18,241 --> 02:10:19,470
but we can't use that term.

3914
02:10:19,471 --> 02:10:20,071
Isn't that funny?

3915
02:10:20,071 --> 02:10:21,330
That they took queer,

3916
02:10:21,360 --> 02:10:22,290
they took queer.

3917
02:10:22,320 --> 02:10:25,140
That's what the universe is a queer thing.

3918
02:10:25,430 --> 02:10:28,290
It doesn't kind of exist
in that way as well.

3919
02:10:28,410 --> 02:10:32,610
They know anything that has hatches to
homosexual men can't have a gay old time

3920
02:10:32,611 --> 02:10:33,190
anymore.

3921
02:10:33,190 --> 02:10:35,640
Place it with a white university.

3922
02:10:35,660 --> 02:10:36,600
Just a stranger.

3923
02:10:36,640 --> 02:10:37,473
They say stranger.

3924
02:10:37,580 --> 02:10:38,413
No,

3925
02:10:38,690 --> 02:10:40,220
like you can't say you
have a gay old time.

3926
02:10:40,221 --> 02:10:43,820
The Flinstones had gay old
time in their fucking song.

3927
02:10:43,850 --> 02:10:44,810
You can't have that anymore.

3928
02:10:45,470 --> 02:10:47,780
We are so sensitive for
such a little babies.

3929
02:10:47,820 --> 02:10:48,400
Yeah.

3930
02:10:48,400 --> 02:10:48,950
Yeah.

3931
02:10:48,950 --> 02:10:50,510
In the middle of all this information,

3932
02:10:50,511 --> 02:10:51,820
we've tried to chalkboards away.

3933
02:10:51,821 --> 02:10:52,610
We're trying to take him,

3934
02:10:52,610 --> 02:10:53,443
take him away.

3935
02:10:53,480 --> 02:10:53,781
So,

3936
02:10:53,781 --> 02:10:54,111
you know,

3937
02:10:54,111 --> 02:10:54,710
I think,

3938
02:10:54,710 --> 02:10:55,540
I think that,

3939
02:10:55,540 --> 02:10:56,373
uh,

3940
02:10:57,680 --> 02:10:57,981
yeah,

3941
02:10:57,981 --> 02:10:59,570
I think that ultimately,

3942
02:10:59,571 --> 02:10:59,900
you know,

3943
02:10:59,900 --> 02:11:00,531
people say,

3944
02:11:00,531 --> 02:11:00,860
well,

3945
02:11:00,860 --> 02:11:05,780
what can we conclude from all this
and what have you learned from taking

3946
02:11:05,781 --> 02:11:06,870
psychedelics,

3947
02:11:06,880 --> 02:11:07,311
you know,

3948
02:11:07,311 --> 02:11:10,130
for 40 years and all that.

3949
02:11:10,131 --> 02:11:12,470
And the answer is kind of disappointing.

3950
02:11:12,471 --> 02:11:14,420
It will be disappointing to some people,

3951
02:11:14,421 --> 02:11:15,254
which is the,

3952
02:11:15,530 --> 02:11:16,430
exactly this,

3953
02:11:16,431 --> 02:11:18,350
the world is a marvelous place,

3954
02:11:18,410 --> 02:11:21,560
much more marvelous than we can imagine.

3955
02:11:22,340 --> 02:11:23,060
You know,

3956
02:11:23,060 --> 02:11:27,080
and we don't know very much,

3957
02:11:27,140 --> 02:11:27,740
you know,

3958
02:11:27,740 --> 02:11:28,041
I mean,

3959
02:11:28,041 --> 02:11:28,791
there are,

3960
02:11:28,791 --> 02:11:30,530
knowledge is so restricted,

3961
02:11:30,890 --> 02:11:31,610
you know?

3962
02:11:31,610 --> 02:11:32,443
Um,

3963
02:11:33,350 --> 02:11:33,730
okay.

3964
02:11:33,730 --> 02:11:34,750
And I think that's,

3965
02:11:34,930 --> 02:11:37,030
that's what you learn after all this time.

3966
02:11:37,090 --> 02:11:39,010
And this is what I owe Osca you know,

3967
02:11:39,011 --> 02:11:42,220
my main plant teacher always insists,

3968
02:11:42,610 --> 02:11:42,910
you know,

3969
02:11:42,910 --> 02:11:43,720
remember,

3970
02:11:43,720 --> 02:11:44,290
you don't know

3971
02:11:44,290 --> 02:11:45,123
shit.

3972
02:11:45,710 --> 02:11:46,543
You know,

3973
02:11:46,840 --> 02:11:47,673
don't give up.

3974
02:11:47,830 --> 02:11:48,570
Don't give up

3975
02:11:48,570 --> 02:11:50,400
arrogant because you don't know shit.

3976
02:11:50,910 --> 02:11:51,420
You know,

3977
02:11:51,420 --> 02:11:53,610
you just don't know very much.

3978
02:11:54,060 --> 02:11:54,893
And so

3979
02:11:57,150 --> 02:11:57,983
it's like,

3980
02:11:58,200 --> 02:11:58,711
you can say,

3981
02:11:58,711 --> 02:11:58,891
well,

3982
02:11:58,891 --> 02:12:01,440
I don't know shit and
I feel really stupid.

3983
02:12:01,441 --> 02:12:06,441
But it also clears the decks to appreciate
things and remind ourselves that we

3984
02:12:07,501 --> 02:12:08,550
don't know very much.

3985
02:12:08,580 --> 02:12:10,470
But if clears the decks for learning,

3986
02:12:10,471 --> 02:12:15,471
it means there's so much left to be
understood that marveled about and thought

3987
02:12:15,961 --> 02:12:16,600
about

3988
02:12:16,600 --> 02:12:18,040
ga excepted position.

3989
02:12:18,250 --> 02:12:18,550
Yeah,

3990
02:12:18,550 --> 02:12:22,600
except the position that you don't know
shit and then enjoy all the information

3991
02:12:22,601 --> 02:12:25,270
there is to take in and all
the fascination and the wonder.

3992
02:12:25,390 --> 02:12:25,690
Yeah.

3993
02:12:25,690 --> 02:12:26,051
She was like,

3994
02:12:26,051 --> 02:12:29,050
people are trying to control the position
and they're trying to control it and

3995
02:12:29,051 --> 02:12:31,960
pretend that they do no shit
and that's the big mistake.

3996
02:12:31,990 --> 02:12:36,130
That's where the knee jerk reaction to
a denying global climate change comes

3997
02:12:36,131 --> 02:12:36,700
from.

3998
02:12:36,700 --> 02:12:41,700
It's a just a desire of insecure people
to try to rationalize and control things

3999
02:12:42,190 --> 02:12:47,190
that can't be controlled and the
politicians want to do religion,

4000
02:12:47,560 --> 02:12:48,221
politics,

4001
02:12:48,221 --> 02:12:49,080
corporations,

4002
02:12:49,090 --> 02:12:49,923
the whole thing.

4003
02:12:50,080 --> 02:12:52,600
Like we have a model we
don't want to change.

4004
02:12:52,601 --> 02:12:55,060
We have a corner on the truth.

4005
02:12:55,600 --> 02:12:58,240
The way we think about
it is the way it is,

4006
02:12:58,360 --> 02:12:58,781
you know,

4007
02:12:58,781 --> 02:13:02,910
and anybody who challenged
us that is a is a heretic.

4008
02:13:03,160 --> 02:13:03,371
Now,

4009
02:13:03,371 --> 02:13:08,371
how long did it take you after lecturer
before you jump back on the horse?

4010
02:13:08,710 --> 02:13:12,490
It seems like if I got smeared across
the entire cosmos for a couple of weeks

4011
02:13:12,491 --> 02:13:14,740
and I don't remember how I
shit or smoke cigarettes,

4012
02:13:15,460 --> 02:13:16,930
I might just fucking quit.

4013
02:13:17,200 --> 02:13:17,621
Okay.

4014
02:13:17,621 --> 02:13:18,454
But not you.

4015
02:13:19,120 --> 02:13:21,550
How much time did you take
off before you jumped back on?

4016
02:13:21,610 --> 02:13:22,443
Well,

4017
02:13:22,720 --> 02:13:26,440
I don't know if some people
never have jumped back on,

4018
02:13:26,441 --> 02:13:27,160
but,

4019
02:13:27,160 --> 02:13:32,070
but how much time did it take
after psychedelic put the can

4020
02:13:32,070 --> 02:13:34,620
of tuna fish and do like normal thing?

4021
02:13:34,621 --> 02:13:34,781
No,

4022
02:13:34,781 --> 02:13:34,971
no,

4023
02:13:34,971 --> 02:13:35,111
no,

4024
02:13:35,111 --> 02:13:35,260
no,

4025
02:13:35,260 --> 02:13:35,411
no,

4026
02:13:35,411 --> 02:13:36,130
no,

4027
02:13:36,130 --> 02:13:36,390
no,

4028
02:13:36,390 --> 02:13:36,601
no,

4029
02:13:36,601 --> 02:13:36,751
no,

4030
02:13:36,751 --> 02:13:36,871
no,

4031
02:13:36,871 --> 02:13:37,021
no,

4032
02:13:37,021 --> 02:13:37,171
no,

4033
02:13:37,171 --> 02:13:37,291
no,

4034
02:13:37,291 --> 02:13:37,441
no.

4035
02:13:37,441 --> 02:13:37,921
I mean,

4036
02:13:37,921 --> 02:13:40,410
how long before you had
another psychedelic experience?

4037
02:13:41,280 --> 02:13:41,461
Oh,

4038
02:13:41,461 --> 02:13:42,180
another site.

4039
02:13:42,180 --> 02:13:42,421
Well,

4040
02:13:42,421 --> 02:13:44,280
it was probably a couple of years.

4041
02:13:44,740 --> 02:13:45,300
I don't know.

4042
02:13:45,300 --> 02:13:45,900
It makes sense.

4043
02:13:45,900 --> 02:13:47,100
It wasn't that long.

4044
02:13:47,220 --> 02:13:48,810
It wasn't really that long.

4045
02:13:49,580 --> 02:13:50,640
That's a long time.

4046
02:13:51,690 --> 02:13:52,140
Yeah.

4047
02:13:52,140 --> 02:13:54,030
Did you like before
you did it and be like,

4048
02:13:54,060 --> 02:13:55,350
what the fuck am I doing?

4049
02:13:55,380 --> 02:13:57,330
Am I really want to get
spread across the university?

4050
02:13:58,710 --> 02:13:59,543
Well,

4051
02:13:59,960 --> 02:14:00,150
yeah.

4052
02:14:00,150 --> 02:14:00,900
I mean I have,

4053
02:14:00,900 --> 02:14:01,733
I have some,

4054
02:14:01,770 --> 02:14:04,050
some worries about it
when I went back to it,

4055
02:14:04,051 --> 02:14:04,410
but,

4056
02:14:04,410 --> 02:14:08,550
but not really because there
were so many other circumstances.

4057
02:14:08,551 --> 02:14:11,040
The psychedelic was just a part of it.

4058
02:14:11,200 --> 02:14:12,450
A lot of it.

4059
02:14:12,930 --> 02:14:17,930
The reason that's happened was
because we set ourselves up into this,

4060
02:14:20,190 --> 02:14:21,023
you know,

4061
02:14:21,030 --> 02:14:24,780
conceptual or I don't know what
you call a it cognitive box.

4062
02:14:24,780 --> 02:14:25,800
We set ourselves,

4063
02:14:25,801 --> 02:14:30,801
we painted ourselves into this corner in
terms of our predictions about what was

4064
02:14:32,371 --> 02:14:33,540
going to happen,

4065
02:14:33,750 --> 02:14:34,410
you know,

4066
02:14:34,410 --> 02:14:36,180
because it was all about time,

4067
02:14:36,181 --> 02:14:36,451
right?

4068
02:14:36,451 --> 02:14:41,070
A lot of it was about time and so
when we were leading up to doing the

4069
02:14:41,071 --> 02:14:41,904
experiment,

4070
02:14:42,630 --> 02:14:44,070
we thought that,

4071
02:14:44,610 --> 02:14:45,150
well,

4072
02:14:45,150 --> 02:14:50,130
the reason all this strange stuff is
happening is because a few hours up ahead

4073
02:14:50,131 --> 02:14:51,180
in the future,

4074
02:14:51,510 --> 02:14:54,960
we've done the experiment
and it is succeeded.

4075
02:14:54,961 --> 02:14:58,680
And so what we're getting is
the backwash from the future,

4076
02:14:59,160 --> 02:15:00,900
like approaching a singularity,

4077
02:15:00,930 --> 02:15:01,201
you know,

4078
02:15:01,201 --> 02:15:05,340
we were getting the backwash from the
future and that's why every it's warping

4079
02:15:05,341 --> 02:15:06,151
reality.

4080
02:15:06,151 --> 02:15:09,810
It literally is warping reality
as we approach this thing.

4081
02:15:10,380 --> 02:15:14,130
So we went into it with the attitude
that something had to happen,

4082
02:15:14,160 --> 02:15:16,850
something physic shattering.

4083
02:15:16,900 --> 02:15:17,280
I'm the,

4084
02:15:17,280 --> 02:15:18,900
we were trying to overturn,

4085
02:15:18,930 --> 02:15:23,130
literally the laws of physics came into
it with the idea that something had to

4086
02:15:23,131 --> 02:15:25,320
happen and guess what,

4087
02:15:25,440 --> 02:15:29,520
something happened just wasn't
what we predicted would happen.

4088
02:15:30,240 --> 02:15:31,710
He just went cuckoo for a couple of weeks.

4089
02:15:31,720 --> 02:15:33,540
Cocoa for a couple of weeks.

4090
02:15:33,570 --> 02:15:33,901
Yeah,

4091
02:15:33,901 --> 02:15:34,591
exactly.

4092
02:15:34,591 --> 02:15:35,490
And we,

4093
02:15:35,670 --> 02:15:37,650
but it was more than just cuckoo.

4094
02:15:37,680 --> 02:15:40,170
It was this,

4095
02:15:41,610 --> 02:15:42,030
you know,

4096
02:15:42,030 --> 02:15:42,391
this,

4097
02:15:42,391 --> 02:15:43,830
this coordinated,

4098
02:15:44,280 --> 02:15:45,113
uh,

4099
02:15:45,810 --> 02:15:48,180
experience of Terrence and myself were,

4100
02:15:48,181 --> 02:15:53,181
we were linked and we understood that
one person is becoming mirror images of

4101
02:15:54,061 --> 02:15:54,894
each other,

4102
02:15:55,020 --> 02:15:58,920
almost like a photograph
and it's negative and one,

4103
02:15:59,190 --> 02:16:02,220
one entity was going forward in time.

4104
02:16:02,221 --> 02:16:04,500
And then another was
going backward in time.

4105
02:16:04,501 --> 02:16:06,040
And you know,

4106
02:16:06,150 --> 02:16:06,930
a lot of,

4107
02:16:06,930 --> 02:16:07,141
I mean,

4108
02:16:07,141 --> 02:16:10,110
we had a whole framework
where it made sense.

4109
02:16:10,170 --> 02:16:11,880
It might not make sense now.

4110
02:16:12,230 --> 02:16:12,930
Yeah.

4111
02:16:12,930 --> 02:16:13,830
Well it doesn't,

4112
02:16:13,831 --> 02:16:14,400
it doesn't,

4113
02:16:14,400 --> 02:16:16,050
I mean it does,

4114
02:16:16,080 --> 02:16:16,913
but I'm lying.

4115
02:16:17,160 --> 02:16:17,671
I does,

4116
02:16:17,671 --> 02:16:18,240
but I mean,

4117
02:16:18,240 --> 02:16:18,550
I,

4118
02:16:18,550 --> 02:16:19,000
I,

4119
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:19,540
it does have,

4120
02:16:19,540 --> 02:16:20,550
but not that I'm lying.

4121
02:16:20,551 --> 02:16:20,821
I mean,

4122
02:16:20,821 --> 02:16:21,190
I'm sorry.

4123
02:16:21,190 --> 02:16:25,050
I do understand that you're trying to
express something that I can't understand.

4124
02:16:25,200 --> 02:16:26,033
Right.

4125
02:16:26,070 --> 02:16:30,120
Did you have a lot of
experiences or experiences where

4126
02:16:30,120 --> 02:16:32,540
you saw ancient motifs?

4127
02:16:32,660 --> 02:16:33,101
And May,

4128
02:16:33,101 --> 02:16:38,101
whether its hieroglyphs or Egyptian or
I've heard people that say they've seen

4129
02:16:38,880 --> 02:16:43,880
aromatic or Arab type writing and w
with seems to be maybe perhaps the

4130
02:16:46,141 --> 02:16:50,640
experiences of other people that have
taken the same sort of psychedelic drugs

4131
02:16:51,090 --> 02:16:52,500
and that it's a stored,

4132
02:16:52,501 --> 02:16:53,880
collected experience.

4133
02:16:54,060 --> 02:16:54,391
I thought,

4134
02:16:54,391 --> 02:16:57,300
I know that was one of the things that
Terrence believed that when you are

4135
02:16:57,301 --> 02:17:00,960
taking psilocybin you're not just taking
silicide when you're sort of conjoining

4136
02:17:00,961 --> 02:17:03,510
the experiences of everybody
who's ever taken that drug ever.

4137
02:17:04,110 --> 02:17:04,943
Did you feel that

4138
02:17:05,500 --> 02:17:07,710
you mean that La Chorrera uh,

4139
02:17:07,720 --> 02:17:08,553
at any point?

4140
02:17:08,790 --> 02:17:10,420
Oh yeah.

4141
02:17:10,780 --> 02:17:11,360
Yeah.

4142
02:17:11,360 --> 02:17:12,820
Subsequently I have had,

4143
02:17:13,030 --> 02:17:15,220
I have had those kinds of impressions.

4144
02:17:15,221 --> 02:17:15,760
Yeah.

4145
02:17:15,760 --> 02:17:16,300
I mean there,

4146
02:17:16,300 --> 02:17:18,310
I mean I think it's interesting that,

4147
02:17:20,410 --> 02:17:20,681
you know,

4148
02:17:20,681 --> 02:17:23,490
one of the things that when,

4149
02:17:23,491 --> 02:17:24,100
when we,

4150
02:17:24,100 --> 02:17:29,100
when we came back from La Chorrera one
of the priorities that our life was to

4151
02:17:30,461 --> 02:17:32,830
figure out how to grow those mushrooms.

4152
02:17:32,831 --> 02:17:33,221
Right.

4153
02:17:33,221 --> 02:17:35,740
So that we can reaccess.

4154
02:17:35,770 --> 02:17:36,160
Right.

4155
02:17:36,160 --> 02:17:37,570
But I mean then there was partly,

4156
02:17:37,600 --> 02:17:37,961
you know,

4157
02:17:37,961 --> 02:17:39,670
there was partly a mercenary motive,

4158
02:17:39,700 --> 02:17:41,180
but there was also the,

4159
02:17:41,210 --> 02:17:46,120
the real motive was we want other
people to have these experiences.

4160
02:17:46,121 --> 02:17:48,400
To see if they confirm,

4161
02:17:49,360 --> 02:17:49,720
you know,

4162
02:17:49,720 --> 02:17:51,360
what we were experienced.

4163
02:17:51,730 --> 02:17:52,091
I mean,

4164
02:17:52,091 --> 02:17:57,091
where we just nuts or do other people
have this similar kind of experience at

4165
02:17:58,121 --> 02:17:59,470
turns out they do.

4166
02:17:59,590 --> 02:18:00,011
You know,

4167
02:18:00,011 --> 02:18:05,011
so that's evidence I can for the objective
reality of some of these dimensions

4168
02:18:05,951 --> 02:18:06,850
or the reality.

4169
02:18:06,851 --> 02:18:08,080
I don't know if it's objective,

4170
02:18:08,081 --> 02:18:09,250
but you know what I'm saying?

4171
02:18:09,790 --> 02:18:11,950
You don't have to be Terence or Dennis.

4172
02:18:11,951 --> 02:18:16,540
You don't have to know what we talk
about or believe in what we talk about.

4173
02:18:16,540 --> 02:18:19,900
You can take mushrooms under
the right circumstances,

4174
02:18:20,440 --> 02:18:20,860
you know,

4175
02:18:20,860 --> 02:18:23,080
in the dark five grams,

4176
02:18:23,110 --> 02:18:27,250
pay attention and you
will go to the same place.

4177
02:18:27,340 --> 02:18:29,110
Many people go to the same place.

4178
02:18:29,111 --> 02:18:34,111
Do you think that that also explains
why the in the Iowasca experience is a,

4179
02:18:34,330 --> 02:18:38,270
a lot of jaguars and a lot
of snakes and a lot of,

4180
02:18:38,271 --> 02:18:39,104
uh,

4181
02:18:39,120 --> 02:18:39,550
that,

4182
02:18:39,550 --> 02:18:41,170
that type of cause to them,

4183
02:18:41,200 --> 02:18:42,790
that's the dimension.

4184
02:18:42,791 --> 02:18:45,610
That's the dimension that's
real for those people.

4185
02:18:45,940 --> 02:18:46,900
And it's just,

4186
02:18:47,890 --> 02:18:48,370
you know,

4187
02:18:48,370 --> 02:18:48,760
it,

4188
02:18:48,760 --> 02:18:49,171
I mean,

4189
02:18:49,171 --> 02:18:54,171
if it is to us it seems
implausible and unlikely,

4190
02:18:54,971 --> 02:18:59,020
but to them it's like it's a
part of their everyday reality.

4191
02:18:59,021 --> 02:19:00,110
They just accept it.

4192
02:19:00,160 --> 02:19:01,960
I mean it's much more matter of fact,

4193
02:19:02,440 --> 02:19:02,801
yes,

4194
02:19:02,801 --> 02:19:04,540
there are these realms,

4195
02:19:04,570 --> 02:19:09,570
there are these entities you can
get there with Iowa Osca and uh,

4196
02:19:12,090 --> 02:19:12,390
you know,

4197
02:19:12,390 --> 02:19:13,350
if you look at,

4198
02:19:13,380 --> 02:19:15,570
if you look at the paintings of Pablo,

4199
02:19:15,571 --> 02:19:16,950
Emma Ringo for example,

4200
02:19:16,951 --> 02:19:17,581
or others,

4201
02:19:17,581 --> 02:19:18,180
you know,

4202
02:19:18,180 --> 02:19:22,470
I mean he had this ability to paint
that realm as best direct elected,

4203
02:19:23,430 --> 02:19:28,010
but that's a tremendous contribution
because he provided a window into that

4204
02:19:28,011 --> 02:19:28,761
cosmology.

4205
02:19:28,761 --> 02:19:32,990
You could sort of look into that
conceptual place without actually taking

4206
02:19:32,991 --> 02:19:37,991
Iowasca as Alex Grey as does Alex
grey a similar kind of thing.

4207
02:19:38,211 --> 02:19:38,690
Yeah.

4208
02:19:38,690 --> 02:19:41,660
All of in Pablos iconography,

4209
02:19:41,690 --> 02:19:46,690
all of these spirits that you see and
you FO's incidentally and plants and

4210
02:19:47,361 --> 02:19:48,590
animals and all that,

4211
02:19:49,160 --> 02:19:50,300
they all have names.

4212
02:19:50,301 --> 02:19:52,190
These are not things that he dreamed up.

4213
02:19:52,250 --> 02:19:56,450
These are part of that cosmos
that he is able to depict.

4214
02:19:56,510 --> 02:19:57,380
What is his name again?

4215
02:19:57,980 --> 02:20:00,740
Pablo Amarigo and may our Ryan,

4216
02:20:00,790 --> 02:20:01,640
I've got to check him out.

4217
02:20:01,641 --> 02:20:02,870
I've never heard of this guy before.

4218
02:20:02,900 --> 02:20:03,410
No.

4219
02:20:03,410 --> 02:20:04,940
I believe I've seen his art,

4220
02:20:04,941 --> 02:20:08,180
but I knew his name and more ring go.

4221
02:20:08,630 --> 02:20:11,960
He has a book that he
put together with Louis.

4222
02:20:11,961 --> 02:20:14,140
Eduardo Luna had good friend of mine,

4223
02:20:14,480 --> 02:20:17,450
Louis Louis wrote the foreword to my book.

4224
02:20:17,510 --> 02:20:17,721
Oh,

4225
02:20:17,721 --> 02:20:19,310
I absolutely have seen this guy before.

4226
02:20:19,340 --> 02:20:19,521
Yeah.

4227
02:20:19,521 --> 02:20:20,354
You've seen it.

4228
02:20:20,440 --> 02:20:21,680
You've seen stuff.

4229
02:20:21,710 --> 02:20:22,100
Yeah.

4230
02:20:22,100 --> 02:20:23,060
So amazing.

4231
02:20:23,510 --> 02:20:23,931
But yeah,

4232
02:20:23,931 --> 02:20:28,931
that's so he recollects his visions and
was able to put them out on to canvas,

4233
02:20:31,340 --> 02:20:32,173
you know?

4234
02:20:32,540 --> 02:20:33,050
Wow.

4235
02:20:33,050 --> 02:20:33,351
Yeah.

4236
02:20:33,351 --> 02:20:33,621
When,

4237
02:20:33,621 --> 02:20:34,760
when a guy can do that,

4238
02:20:34,761 --> 02:20:35,110
like,

4239
02:20:35,110 --> 02:20:35,390
uh,

4240
02:20:35,390 --> 02:20:36,021
Alex Grey,

4241
02:20:36,021 --> 02:20:37,580
especially some of his images,

4242
02:20:37,690 --> 02:20:38,090
um,

4243
02:20:38,090 --> 02:20:38,430
they,

4244
02:20:38,430 --> 02:20:39,920
they appear Egyptian,

4245
02:20:40,210 --> 02:20:42,410
they appear DMT slash.

4246
02:20:42,411 --> 02:20:43,244
Egyptian.

4247
02:20:43,450 --> 02:20:43,760
You know,

4248
02:20:43,760 --> 02:20:45,440
and I've always wondered like,

4249
02:20:45,441 --> 02:20:46,120
what is,

4250
02:20:46,120 --> 02:20:48,230
what is that that you're
seeing when you're,

4251
02:20:48,231 --> 02:20:52,100
when you're seeing this sort
of ancient motif and all that,

4252
02:20:52,170 --> 02:20:53,003
the,

4253
02:20:53,510 --> 02:20:54,343
it seems,

4254
02:20:54,770 --> 02:20:55,670
for whatever reason,

4255
02:20:55,730 --> 02:20:57,950
it seems like a crazy
assertion that you're,

4256
02:20:57,951 --> 02:20:58,530
uh,

4257
02:20:58,530 --> 02:21:01,880
you're accessing the experiences of all
these people that have ever done this,

4258
02:21:01,940 --> 02:21:02,773
this drug.

4259
02:21:02,990 --> 02:21:05,720
ButW is it any weirder than cell phones,

4260
02:21:06,230 --> 02:21:06,561
you know,

4261
02:21:06,561 --> 02:21:09,050
is that any weirder than the
ability to Google something?

4262
02:21:09,070 --> 02:21:09,480
And that one,

4263
02:21:09,480 --> 02:21:09,950
Scott,

4264
02:21:09,950 --> 02:21:10,431
and weird,

4265
02:21:10,431 --> 02:21:13,310
it's inherently not any weirder
than the hobbit in three d.

4266
02:21:13,520 --> 02:21:13,761
I mean,

4267
02:21:13,761 --> 02:21:14,510
you could say,

4268
02:21:14,510 --> 02:21:14,751
yeah.

4269
02:21:14,751 --> 02:21:15,531
You could say,

4270
02:21:15,531 --> 02:21:15,891
you know,

4271
02:21:15,891 --> 02:21:16,460
well,

4272
02:21:16,460 --> 02:21:21,460
it's a similar experience because these
mushrooms activate the same receptors

4273
02:21:21,771 --> 02:21:22,520
that everybody,

4274
02:21:22,520 --> 02:21:25,770
and we all have a similar brain
architecture and all that.

4275
02:21:25,810 --> 02:21:27,800
And I think that to a certain extent,

4276
02:21:27,980 --> 02:21:28,820
that's part of it.

4277
02:21:28,940 --> 02:21:30,800
But that's not the,

4278
02:21:31,040 --> 02:21:32,540
that's not the whole story.

4279
02:21:32,600 --> 02:21:32,841
I mean,

4280
02:21:32,841 --> 02:21:33,231
again,

4281
02:21:33,231 --> 02:21:34,760
that comes back to whether,

4282
02:21:35,120 --> 02:21:35,780
you know,

4283
02:21:35,780 --> 02:21:39,320
the brain is generating this
stuff or whether it's actually,

4284
02:21:39,860 --> 02:21:40,131
you know,

4285
02:21:40,131 --> 02:21:43,640
sort of just making the membrane
thinner so that you can look at it.

4286
02:21:43,880 --> 02:21:48,140
Did you have any experience with
a sensory deprivation tanks?

4287
02:21:49,250 --> 02:21:51,530
I haven't had very much with that,

4288
02:21:51,620 --> 02:21:52,270
no.

4289
02:21:52,270 --> 02:21:52,970
Wow,

4290
02:21:52,970 --> 02:21:53,691
that's so crazy.

4291
02:21:53,691 --> 02:21:55,070
That seems like it'd
be right up your alley.

4292
02:21:55,160 --> 02:21:56,300
You'd think so.

4293
02:21:57,470 --> 02:21:57,950
Yeah.

4294
02:21:57,950 --> 02:22:00,650
I haven't experimented with it.

4295
02:22:01,310 --> 02:22:02,630
Have you been interested in at all?

4296
02:22:03,220 --> 02:22:03,650
Uh,

4297
02:22:03,650 --> 02:22:04,483
not really

4298
02:22:05,910 --> 02:22:06,471
that the,

4299
02:22:06,471 --> 02:22:07,160
uh,

4300
02:22:07,160 --> 02:22:08,330
the substances,

4301
02:22:08,360 --> 02:22:09,193
you know,

4302
02:22:09,210 --> 02:22:10,970
seem to reliably do it,

4303
02:22:10,971 --> 02:22:11,631
but yeah,

4304
02:22:11,631 --> 02:22:12,330
I should,

4305
02:22:12,330 --> 02:22:12,770
uh,

4306
02:22:12,770 --> 02:22:13,820
should look into it.

4307
02:22:14,390 --> 02:22:15,260
I'm a big fan.

4308
02:22:15,350 --> 02:22:15,860
Are you?

4309
02:22:15,860 --> 02:22:16,370
Oh yeah.

4310
02:22:16,370 --> 02:22:17,750
Even just for relaxation,

4311
02:22:17,840 --> 02:22:17,931
uh,

4312
02:22:17,931 --> 02:22:18,111
for,

4313
02:22:18,111 --> 02:22:18,860
just for the body.

4314
02:22:18,860 --> 02:22:21,590
You do it in conjunction
with psychedelics or,

4315
02:22:21,640 --> 02:22:22,473
yes.

4316
02:22:22,570 --> 02:22:22,850
Okay.

4317
02:22:22,850 --> 02:22:23,631
So at night,

4318
02:22:23,631 --> 02:22:24,080
Sam,

4319
02:22:24,080 --> 02:22:24,530
eating,

4320
02:22:24,530 --> 02:22:26,020
eating is my favorite

4321
02:22:26,020 --> 02:22:26,320
one.

4322
02:22:26,320 --> 02:22:27,500
Oh yeah.

4323
02:22:27,520 --> 02:22:27,880
Okay.

4324
02:22:27,880 --> 02:22:30,570
Eating cannabis and getting
to the point where you're,

4325
02:22:30,600 --> 02:22:31,780
you're like,

4326
02:22:31,990 --> 02:22:33,100
the way I describe what,

4327
02:22:33,130 --> 02:22:34,150
I try to describe it as a,

4328
02:22:34,240 --> 02:22:36,850
when you're so high
that you feel like the,

4329
02:22:36,860 --> 02:22:37,360
the,

4330
02:22:37,360 --> 02:22:39,070
the parallel dimension,

4331
02:22:39,071 --> 02:22:43,270
the neighboring dimension
is like a waterfall and
you've got your nose touching

4332
02:22:43,271 --> 02:22:45,880
the water and you're right about
the push to the other side.

4333
02:22:46,300 --> 02:22:47,380
That's when you get in the tank.

4334
02:22:47,890 --> 02:22:48,850
So right when you just,

4335
02:22:48,880 --> 02:22:51,760
you know that there's a moment when
you feel like you've eaten too much,

4336
02:22:51,850 --> 02:22:53,410
like you had a pop round and you're like,

4337
02:22:53,411 --> 02:22:54,880
this is not a comfortable feeling.

4338
02:22:55,150 --> 02:22:55,660
Terrible.

4339
02:22:55,660 --> 02:22:57,010
I definitely ate too much.

4340
02:22:57,250 --> 02:22:58,390
That's when he get in the tank.

4341
02:22:58,410 --> 02:22:59,080
Interesting.

4342
02:22:59,080 --> 02:23:04,080
And the complete lack of sensory input
from the tank along with that just blows

4343
02:23:05,621 --> 02:23:07,180
the whole experience out of the water.

4344
02:23:07,181 --> 02:23:09,910
I've had some of the
wildest trips in my life,

4345
02:23:10,160 --> 02:23:10,720
um,

4346
02:23:10,720 --> 02:23:11,111
from,

4347
02:23:11,111 --> 02:23:11,944
from doing that,

4348
02:23:12,110 --> 02:23:15,880
the sensory deprivation tank on its
own can put you in some crazy places,

4349
02:23:16,150 --> 02:23:16,630
but,

4350
02:23:16,630 --> 02:23:17,980
but about on its own,

4351
02:23:17,981 --> 02:23:19,600
but it's really good for his relaxation.

4352
02:23:19,600 --> 02:23:24,340
It's amazing for like loosening
you up and just soothing the body.

4353
02:23:24,341 --> 02:23:26,350
And it's an excellent
source of magnesium too,

4354
02:23:26,351 --> 02:23:27,730
because of the salt and the water.

4355
02:23:27,760 --> 02:23:28,750
It's Epson salts.

4356
02:23:29,200 --> 02:23:32,950
So it's one of the best ways for your
body to absorb a good amount of magnesium.

4357
02:23:33,810 --> 02:23:34,391
But I just,

4358
02:23:34,391 --> 02:23:34,600
I,

4359
02:23:34,600 --> 02:23:37,960
it's one of the things that I've never
understood why more people didn't get

4360
02:23:37,961 --> 02:23:38,351
into it.

4361
02:23:38,351 --> 02:23:38,860
I don't knit.

4362
02:23:38,860 --> 02:23:39,310
Lily.

4363
02:23:39,310 --> 02:23:43,990
John Lilly was the inventor of it
and he used one on a regular basis.

4364
02:23:43,991 --> 02:23:44,351
I just,

4365
02:23:44,351 --> 02:23:45,040
I never,

4366
02:23:45,040 --> 02:23:47,140
I always wanted to know
why that didn't catch on.

4367
02:23:47,260 --> 02:23:49,300
I never heard Karen's
talk about it either.

4368
02:23:49,620 --> 02:23:49,921
No,

4369
02:23:49,921 --> 02:23:50,111
he,

4370
02:23:50,111 --> 02:23:50,850
he didn't,

4371
02:23:50,850 --> 02:23:53,130
he didn't use it as far as I know.

4372
02:23:53,250 --> 02:23:54,083
Um,

4373
02:23:54,150 --> 02:23:54,983
I don't know.

4374
02:23:55,150 --> 02:23:58,390
It's such an amazing resource because
he was always in a silent darkness.

4375
02:23:58,420 --> 02:23:58,680
Yeah.

4376
02:23:58,680 --> 02:23:59,070
Well,

4377
02:23:59,070 --> 02:23:59,611
exactly.

4378
02:23:59,611 --> 02:24:00,150
Take it.

4379
02:24:00,150 --> 02:24:01,280
So assignment in,

4380
02:24:01,320 --> 02:24:03,750
in near total darkness,

4381
02:24:04,170 --> 02:24:06,780
there's kind of a sensory deprivation.

4382
02:24:07,940 --> 02:24:09,140
You're still in your body.

4383
02:24:09,150 --> 02:24:09,390
I mean,

4384
02:24:09,390 --> 02:24:12,380
he's still are not in this amniotic place,

4385
02:24:12,420 --> 02:24:13,110
you know?

4386
02:24:13,110 --> 02:24:15,690
Have you ever tried mushrooms?

4387
02:24:15,700 --> 02:24:17,250
Will see the isolation tank?

4388
02:24:17,310 --> 02:24:17,880
No,

4389
02:24:17,880 --> 02:24:18,610
I have not done well.

4390
02:24:18,610 --> 02:24:18,871
No,

4391
02:24:18,871 --> 02:24:19,231
I did it.

4392
02:24:19,231 --> 02:24:20,130
I have done at once,

4393
02:24:20,160 --> 02:24:21,810
but I have not done a big dose.

4394
02:24:21,990 --> 02:24:22,411
I haven't,

4395
02:24:22,411 --> 02:24:23,580
I haven't done a lot but,

4396
02:24:24,180 --> 02:24:27,510
but mostly seem to be a good place for it.

4397
02:24:27,530 --> 02:24:27,720
Good.

4398
02:24:27,720 --> 02:24:28,440
Yeah.

4399
02:24:28,440 --> 02:24:31,500
The problem is I have kids and I don't
want to be blasted on in my head and that

4400
02:24:31,501 --> 02:24:34,500
thing and then to have something go wrong
and you open the door and reality just

4401
02:24:34,501 --> 02:24:35,790
hasn't tuned back in yet.

4402
02:24:35,791 --> 02:24:36,061
You know,

4403
02:24:36,061 --> 02:24:38,610
you've got to plan your sessions,

4404
02:24:38,611 --> 02:24:41,010
you need somebody to look after kids.

4405
02:24:41,011 --> 02:24:42,380
It's hard said aid,

4406
02:24:42,390 --> 02:24:42,960
all that.

4407
02:24:42,960 --> 02:24:44,220
One of the things about cannabis,

4408
02:24:44,221 --> 02:24:45,000
those are eating candy.

4409
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:45,100
If,

4410
02:24:45,100 --> 02:24:46,110
if I get too high,

4411
02:24:46,111 --> 02:24:47,310
I can still deal with shit.

4412
02:24:47,400 --> 02:24:47,670
Right.

4413
02:24:47,670 --> 02:24:48,690
Adrenaline rises.

4414
02:24:48,691 --> 02:24:49,441
I got a phone call,

4415
02:24:49,441 --> 02:24:50,041
I can call,

4416
02:24:50,041 --> 02:24:51,120
I can talk to people,

4417
02:24:51,270 --> 02:24:52,620
I can come back out of reality.

4418
02:24:52,621 --> 02:24:53,071
I can get back.

4419
02:24:53,071 --> 02:24:53,904
It'd be okay.

4420
02:24:54,840 --> 02:24:56,590
And that combined with the,

4421
02:24:56,591 --> 02:24:56,710
uh,

4422
02:24:56,710 --> 02:24:58,610
the sensory depth tank is a,

4423
02:24:59,250 --> 02:24:59,851
it's a pretty,

4424
02:24:59,851 --> 02:25:01,260
pretty profound experience.

4425
02:25:01,410 --> 02:25:03,900
But I think probably if
you were into silent dark,

4426
02:25:03,930 --> 02:25:06,750
the thing about suicide and those
that he pulls you out so much,

4427
02:25:06,930 --> 02:25:09,210
you almost don't even
need a sensory dep tank.

4428
02:25:09,211 --> 02:25:11,400
It's almost like unnecessary.

4429
02:25:11,490 --> 02:25:12,600
It's unnecessary.

4430
02:25:12,640 --> 02:25:13,410
Yeah,

4431
02:25:13,410 --> 02:25:14,243
but by itself.

4432
02:25:14,300 --> 02:25:15,560
But it would be interesting.

4433
02:25:15,770 --> 02:25:18,680
It would be interesting if your
experience with those things.

4434
02:25:18,681 --> 02:25:19,514
You,

4435
02:25:19,950 --> 02:25:20,900
you go first.

4436
02:25:20,901 --> 02:25:21,734
I'll follow.

4437
02:25:21,980 --> 02:25:22,813
Yeah.

4438
02:25:22,980 --> 02:25:23,170
Well,

4439
02:25:23,170 --> 02:25:23,740
I have one,

4440
02:25:23,740 --> 02:25:23,980
I have

4441
02:25:23,980 --> 02:25:24,813
one in my basement,

4442
02:25:25,120 --> 02:25:26,320
so I like to use it.

4443
02:25:26,321 --> 02:25:27,250
I use it all the time.

4444
02:25:27,430 --> 02:25:27,940
But uh,

4445
02:25:27,940 --> 02:25:30,400
even just like I said by
itself just for relaxation,

4446
02:25:30,910 --> 02:25:34,240
but I just never understood why more
people didn't want to have that.

4447
02:25:34,241 --> 02:25:35,650
Just as a meditation tool,

4448
02:25:35,651 --> 02:25:36,310
it's a,

4449
02:25:36,310 --> 02:25:40,330
as a tool for completely getting alone
with your thoughts and just separating

4450
02:25:40,331 --> 02:25:42,220
yourself from any of the input of the body

4451
02:25:43,930 --> 02:25:45,700
seems that it would be useful.

4452
02:25:46,090 --> 02:25:47,470
But Terrence wasn't into that.

4453
02:25:47,471 --> 02:25:51,100
But he was in the pot on
a serious regular basis.

4454
02:25:51,120 --> 02:25:51,420
God,

4455
02:25:51,420 --> 02:25:52,253
yes,

4456
02:25:54,910 --> 02:25:55,281
man.

4457
02:25:55,281 --> 02:26:00,281
Had the capacity for cannabis that
I've never seen in anyone else.

4458
02:26:00,830 --> 02:26:05,830
Is that part of the reason why he
went on these rambling lectures?

4459
02:26:07,351 --> 02:26:08,220
He's incredible.

4460
02:26:08,310 --> 02:26:08,461
I mean,

4461
02:26:08,461 --> 02:26:13,020
he would wind the wind him up and some
of the great mp3s that are available on

4462
02:26:13,021 --> 02:26:15,660
the psychedelic salon of you even
familiar with the soccer Exelon,

4463
02:26:15,990 --> 02:26:18,270
great podcast and Renzo,

4464
02:26:18,271 --> 02:26:19,650
the guy who hosts it has,

4465
02:26:19,700 --> 02:26:22,590
I'm just hour upon hour
of Terrence's lectures.

4466
02:26:22,860 --> 02:26:23,401
Amazing,

4467
02:26:23,401 --> 02:26:24,061
amazing stuff.

4468
02:26:24,061 --> 02:26:26,340
But what was incredible was that you just,

4469
02:26:26,820 --> 02:26:31,080
he would just go up there
and the wind him up,

4470
02:26:31,230 --> 02:26:33,930
put him on the stage right when we're
in front of the microphone and he would

4471
02:26:33,931 --> 02:26:35,160
just go on for hours.

4472
02:26:35,690 --> 02:26:36,970
Just wrap it out.

4473
02:26:37,960 --> 02:26:38,310
Yeah,

4474
02:26:38,310 --> 02:26:38,840
it was,

4475
02:26:38,840 --> 02:26:39,091
I mean,

4476
02:26:39,091 --> 02:26:40,530
I'm sure he was high as fuck,

4477
02:26:40,560 --> 02:26:40,921
credit,

4478
02:26:40,921 --> 02:26:41,754
cannabis,

4479
02:26:42,420 --> 02:26:43,253
a lot of that,

4480
02:26:43,470 --> 02:26:43,831
you know,

4481
02:26:43,831 --> 02:26:45,000
his inspiration,

4482
02:26:45,030 --> 02:26:48,150
what he was doing was essentially what,

4483
02:26:48,330 --> 02:26:48,900
you know,

4484
02:26:48,900 --> 02:26:50,190
what he used to do,

4485
02:26:50,191 --> 02:26:50,551
I mean,

4486
02:26:50,551 --> 02:26:55,551
back before anybody knew
about him or us or whatever,

4487
02:26:56,700 --> 02:26:57,480
you know,

4488
02:26:57,480 --> 02:27:00,180
back in the Berkeley
days in the 60s you know,

4489
02:27:00,181 --> 02:27:04,050
he loved nothing more to that to
get a bunch of people in a room,

4490
02:27:04,740 --> 02:27:05,160
you know,

4491
02:27:05,160 --> 02:27:09,630
pat pass around hash or some
kind of really strong dope,

4492
02:27:09,631 --> 02:27:13,020
something that would render
everybody else completely speechless.

4493
02:27:14,390 --> 02:27:15,980
They couldn't say anything.

4494
02:27:15,981 --> 02:27:17,970
And then he would just regale the first

4495
02:27:18,060 --> 02:27:18,893
hours,

4496
02:27:19,430 --> 02:27:19,821
you know?

4497
02:27:19,821 --> 02:27:20,130
And,

4498
02:27:20,130 --> 02:27:20,963
and he was,

4499
02:27:21,030 --> 02:27:21,291
and they,

4500
02:27:21,291 --> 02:27:22,830
everybody was fascinated and mean.

4501
02:27:22,831 --> 02:27:24,480
He was totally coherent.

4502
02:27:24,510 --> 02:27:24,790
I mean,

4503
02:27:24,790 --> 02:27:25,200
everyone,

4504
02:27:25,200 --> 02:27:25,471
you know,

4505
02:27:25,471 --> 02:27:26,161
a lot of people,

4506
02:27:26,161 --> 02:27:28,170
they smoke a lot of cannabis.

4507
02:27:28,171 --> 02:27:29,250
They get quiet,

4508
02:27:29,310 --> 02:27:29,700
right?

4509
02:27:29,700 --> 02:27:30,810
I'm one of those,

4510
02:27:31,230 --> 02:27:33,600
I can't rap on cannabis very well,

4511
02:27:33,601 --> 02:27:34,980
but he just,

4512
02:27:35,010 --> 02:27:36,540
he could do it and that,

4513
02:27:36,600 --> 02:27:38,280
and then he found not only,

4514
02:27:38,281 --> 02:27:38,551
you know,

4515
02:27:38,551 --> 02:27:40,560
if it works for a bedroom full of people,

4516
02:27:40,561 --> 02:27:40,801
I mean,

4517
02:27:40,801 --> 02:27:41,361
as you know,

4518
02:27:41,361 --> 02:27:44,070
and his Hippie crash pad
though and Telegraph Avenue,

4519
02:27:44,071 --> 02:27:47,310
it'll work for audiences
all over the world.

4520
02:27:47,311 --> 02:27:52,311
So he turned it into a shtick
and living and thank God he did.

4521
02:27:53,071 --> 02:27:53,850
You know,

4522
02:27:53,850 --> 02:27:55,140
cause uh,

4523
02:27:55,320 --> 02:27:55,891
cause you know,

4524
02:27:55,891 --> 02:27:57,660
we have all that out there.

4525
02:27:58,020 --> 02:28:03,020
Thank God he did as well because
those recordings and the books and the

4526
02:28:03,091 --> 02:28:03,924
lectures,

4527
02:28:03,930 --> 02:28:08,930
those experiences changed the entire
direction of a lot of people's lives,

4528
02:28:10,170 --> 02:28:11,220
including mine.

4529
02:28:11,340 --> 02:28:12,061
Absolutely.

4530
02:28:12,061 --> 02:28:12,894
Mine.

4531
02:28:12,990 --> 02:28:14,430
The first time I did DMT,

4532
02:28:14,431 --> 02:28:18,780
I literally heard him saying
something in the DMT trip.

4533
02:28:18,781 --> 02:28:20,940
I'd heard his voice saying,

4534
02:28:21,500 --> 02:28:21,830
right.

4535
02:28:21,830 --> 02:28:22,341
It was a,

4536
02:28:22,341 --> 02:28:23,174
it was just,

4537
02:28:23,810 --> 02:28:24,260
it,

4538
02:28:24,260 --> 02:28:26,870
his impact I think is,

4539
02:28:26,871 --> 02:28:27,704
uh,

4540
02:28:28,400 --> 02:28:30,350
it was unbelievably profound.

4541
02:28:30,530 --> 02:28:35,530
That ability to relay those thoughts
in this really compelling way.

4542
02:28:35,940 --> 02:28:36,320
Really.

4543
02:28:36,320 --> 02:28:36,860
I mean,

4544
02:28:36,860 --> 02:28:37,080
there,

4545
02:28:37,080 --> 02:28:40,280
I can't tell you how many gigs I've
gone on where I had to travel or how to

4546
02:28:40,370 --> 02:28:41,330
drive.

4547
02:28:41,331 --> 02:28:43,910
And I just listened to
a psychedelic salon,

4548
02:28:43,911 --> 02:28:45,280
listened to one of the lectures,

4549
02:28:45,290 --> 02:28:47,330
just so compelling and fascinating.

4550
02:28:47,331 --> 02:28:50,980
And I think that opens up a completely
new lines of thinking for a lot of people

4551
02:28:51,380 --> 02:28:51,910
does.

4552
02:28:51,910 --> 02:28:52,780
And you know,

4553
02:28:52,781 --> 02:28:54,100
it's interesting the,

4554
02:28:54,101 --> 02:28:54,640
the,

4555
02:28:54,640 --> 02:28:55,473
the,

4556
02:28:55,590 --> 02:28:55,870
you know,

4557
02:28:55,870 --> 02:28:57,850
the currency that this has,

4558
02:28:58,150 --> 02:28:59,350
he's still out there.

4559
02:28:59,351 --> 02:29:03,260
He's achieved this weird kind
of immortality on the dance.

4560
02:29:03,270 --> 02:29:08,270
You know what he said when you think
about most of this was early nineties when

4561
02:29:09,791 --> 02:29:10,930
he was talking about this,

4562
02:29:10,931 --> 02:29:15,931
but you could put a tape on and it's
just as timely as though we're other

4563
02:29:16,010 --> 02:29:21,010
yesterday he has this real
feeling for the future and,

4564
02:29:21,011 --> 02:29:21,761
and you know,

4565
02:29:21,761 --> 02:29:22,930
people come up to me,

4566
02:29:22,931 --> 02:29:25,870
a lot of young people
come up to me and said,

4567
02:29:25,940 --> 02:29:26,350
I've,

4568
02:29:26,350 --> 02:29:27,310
everything I learned,

4569
02:29:27,311 --> 02:29:28,720
I learned from Terence Mckenna.

4570
02:29:29,890 --> 02:29:32,950
And it was like before
that my life was empty.

4571
02:29:32,951 --> 02:29:34,690
And now I understand that.

4572
02:29:34,720 --> 02:29:35,960
And you look at these people in,

4573
02:29:35,961 --> 02:29:40,961
you say they couldn't have been more than
eight or seven or eight when he was at

4574
02:29:41,561 --> 02:29:43,390
the height of his career.

4575
02:29:43,391 --> 02:29:43,751
You know,

4576
02:29:43,751 --> 02:29:44,584
these people,

4577
02:29:44,650 --> 02:29:47,200
some of were in diapers when he was,

4578
02:29:47,730 --> 02:29:48,160
you know,

4579
02:29:48,160 --> 02:29:49,120
at the height of his career.

4580
02:29:49,121 --> 02:29:50,890
So they discovered him later.

4581
02:29:50,910 --> 02:29:51,430
Yes.

4582
02:29:51,430 --> 02:29:51,971
Somehow.

4583
02:29:51,971 --> 02:29:53,710
And he still had this impact.

4584
02:29:53,970 --> 02:29:54,121
Well,

4585
02:29:54,121 --> 02:29:55,500
it's because it's so compelling.

4586
02:29:55,501 --> 02:29:57,390
It's a very completely viral thing.

4587
02:29:57,420 --> 02:30:00,030
I mean there's a lot of different people
that have a lot of different ideas,

4588
02:30:00,031 --> 02:30:00,630
but they,

4589
02:30:00,630 --> 02:30:01,110
whatever,

4590
02:30:01,110 --> 02:30:02,730
for whatever reason it wasn't compelling.

4591
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:03,650
I think it's,

4592
02:30:03,650 --> 02:30:04,080
uh,

4593
02:30:04,080 --> 02:30:04,570
uh,

4594
02:30:04,570 --> 02:30:05,111
what,

4595
02:30:05,111 --> 02:30:05,280
uh,

4596
02:30:05,280 --> 02:30:08,240
one of the great things
that you're doing in a,

4597
02:30:08,250 --> 02:30:11,490
in this book is you're
not sugarcoating anything.

4598
02:30:11,550 --> 02:30:12,301
And you know,

4599
02:30:12,301 --> 02:30:16,440
the way you described your brother is
with obviously with great love and respect

4600
02:30:16,441 --> 02:30:17,041
and admiration,

4601
02:30:17,041 --> 02:30:18,180
but also great honesty.

4602
02:30:18,570 --> 02:30:19,480
And I think that's,

4603
02:30:19,530 --> 02:30:20,700
that's very important.

4604
02:30:20,760 --> 02:30:21,321
I think it's,

4605
02:30:21,321 --> 02:30:22,051
it's really,

4606
02:30:22,051 --> 02:30:25,960
really important for recognizing his
true contributions and recognizing that

4607
02:30:25,980 --> 02:30:26,611
like all of us,

4608
02:30:26,611 --> 02:30:30,840
he's a human being who was experimenting
with all these ideas and sometimes they

4609
02:30:30,841 --> 02:30:31,320
didn't,

4610
02:30:31,320 --> 02:30:32,550
they weren't correct.

4611
02:30:32,551 --> 02:30:34,460
But that's the only way
you get to those Id.

4612
02:30:34,470 --> 02:30:37,950
They have to sort of evolve and form
when you have to keep playing with them.

4613
02:30:38,340 --> 02:30:40,950
And in the nature of that and the
nature of like full disclosure,

4614
02:30:40,951 --> 02:30:41,880
like what were the,

4615
02:30:41,881 --> 02:30:46,020
like if there's any glaring errors
that he had made that people have,

4616
02:30:46,260 --> 02:30:47,093
uh,

4617
02:30:47,940 --> 02:30:52,360
either repeated or that they
have misinformation because
of these glaring error.

4618
02:30:52,361 --> 02:30:53,310
So like what would it be?

4619
02:30:55,110 --> 02:30:57,180
What glaring errors did he,

4620
02:30:57,560 --> 02:30:59,190
or any errors that like

4621
02:31:00,590 --> 02:31:01,700
deserve mention?

4622
02:31:03,590 --> 02:31:04,161
I don't know.

4623
02:31:04,161 --> 02:31:04,671
I'd have to,

4624
02:31:04,671 --> 02:31:05,950
I'd have to think about,

4625
02:31:06,670 --> 02:31:07,220
uh,

4626
02:31:07,220 --> 02:31:07,670
you know,

4627
02:31:07,670 --> 02:31:07,971
I mean,

4628
02:31:07,971 --> 02:31:08,290
I,

4629
02:31:08,290 --> 02:31:08,481
I,

4630
02:31:08,481 --> 02:31:09,210
it is,

4631
02:31:09,210 --> 02:31:11,090
it is an effort to depict him.

4632
02:31:11,091 --> 02:31:11,811
Honestly.

4633
02:31:11,811 --> 02:31:13,250
I hope that people don't,

4634
02:31:13,940 --> 02:31:14,241
you know,

4635
02:31:14,241 --> 02:31:15,590
I hope that people see that.

4636
02:31:15,620 --> 02:31:16,820
You obviously do,

4637
02:31:16,850 --> 02:31:17,181
you know,

4638
02:31:17,181 --> 02:31:19,530
I'd love to him a great deal.

4639
02:31:19,560 --> 02:31:22,560
I respected him a great deal and,

4640
02:31:22,680 --> 02:31:23,160
you know,

4641
02:31:23,160 --> 02:31:26,580
but we had our rifle Reese
and like all brothers,

4642
02:31:26,581 --> 02:31:26,941
you know,

4643
02:31:26,941 --> 02:31:28,860
we had our sibling rivalries.

4644
02:31:28,861 --> 02:31:29,694
So,

4645
02:31:29,700 --> 02:31:30,270
you know,

4646
02:31:30,270 --> 02:31:30,661
I mean,

4647
02:31:30,661 --> 02:31:32,160
I loved him deeply.

4648
02:31:32,190 --> 02:31:33,690
I hated him deeply.

4649
02:31:33,691 --> 02:31:34,220
It was,

4650
02:31:34,220 --> 02:31:34,650
you know,

4651
02:31:34,650 --> 02:31:36,790
that kind of dynamic goes on.

4652
02:31:36,920 --> 02:31:37,031
Well,

4653
02:31:37,031 --> 02:31:40,320
when you said earlier that he
would say something and you say,

4654
02:31:40,321 --> 02:31:40,431
well,

4655
02:31:40,431 --> 02:31:43,250
that didn't make any sense and you just
contradicted what you said earlier.

4656
02:31:43,251 --> 02:31:44,360
Do you have any like specific,

4657
02:31:45,150 --> 02:31:45,801
well he,

4658
02:31:45,801 --> 02:31:47,280
he would always respond to the,

4659
02:31:47,281 --> 02:31:47,551
you know,

4660
02:31:47,551 --> 02:31:51,120
he didn't like me to go to his seminars
so much cause I was the only one that

4661
02:31:51,121 --> 02:31:52,200
would ever challenge him.

4662
02:31:52,230 --> 02:31:57,230
Everyone else's list name and sort of
slack jawed fascination of his utter in

4663
02:31:58,381 --> 02:32:00,360
these completely,

4664
02:32:00,390 --> 02:32:00,780
you know,

4665
02:32:00,780 --> 02:32:02,160
wild ideas.

4666
02:32:02,161 --> 02:32:05,100
And I was the only one who would
really ever get up and say,

4667
02:32:05,101 --> 02:32:07,020
well what you've said 20 minutes ago,

4668
02:32:07,290 --> 02:32:10,410
it doesn't make any sense and
it contradicts what you say now.

4669
02:32:10,411 --> 02:32:12,060
And he would respond with,

4670
02:32:12,061 --> 02:32:15,240
well consistency is the
Hobgoblin of small minds.

4671
02:32:15,290 --> 02:32:16,123
Describe

4672
02:32:20,060 --> 02:32:21,230
what a great quote.

4673
02:32:21,260 --> 02:32:21,800
Right?

4674
02:32:21,800 --> 02:32:24,020
Oh that's my new message board quote.

4675
02:32:24,260 --> 02:32:27,830
Cause his actually I think he was,

4676
02:32:27,920 --> 02:32:31,520
I think he was quoting
Walt said that's great.

4677
02:32:31,570 --> 02:32:34,190
That was so the thing is terrible.

4678
02:32:34,220 --> 02:32:38,360
It's a like to have fun with ideas,

4679
02:32:38,361 --> 02:32:38,820
you know.

4680
02:32:38,820 --> 02:32:43,820
And in some ways people took
him too seriously and you know,

4681
02:32:43,980 --> 02:32:48,980
I mean there was a tendency on the part
of some of his constituents to view him

4682
02:32:50,311 --> 02:32:52,390
as a guru or a,

4683
02:32:52,420 --> 02:32:52,840
you know,

4684
02:32:52,840 --> 02:32:55,260
even a cult figure to a certain extent.

4685
02:32:55,920 --> 02:32:57,660
I think he rejected all that.

4686
02:32:57,720 --> 02:32:59,730
He didn't want to be a guru.

4687
02:32:59,760 --> 02:33:02,760
He did see himself as a girl.

4688
02:33:02,761 --> 02:33:05,220
He wanted to stimulate people to,

4689
02:33:06,800 --> 02:33:08,190
I think for themselves.

4690
02:33:08,820 --> 02:33:09,151
You know,

4691
02:33:09,151 --> 02:33:10,080
that was the thing.

4692
02:33:10,110 --> 02:33:11,370
Don't believe me,

4693
02:33:11,371 --> 02:33:12,480
but okay,

4694
02:33:12,481 --> 02:33:15,030
here's a whole bunch
of really crazy ideas.

4695
02:33:15,060 --> 02:33:15,500
You know,

4696
02:33:15,500 --> 02:33:19,820
there's a great video with a bunch
of images and Terrence's words.

4697
02:33:19,850 --> 02:33:20,900
Culture is your enemy.

4698
02:33:20,930 --> 02:33:21,763
If you ever,

4699
02:33:21,900 --> 02:33:22,980
culture is not your friend.

4700
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:23,460
Yes,

4701
02:33:23,460 --> 02:33:25,040
culture's not your
culture's not your friend.

4702
02:33:25,041 --> 02:33:25,731
It's very quick.

4703
02:33:25,731 --> 02:33:26,564
But it's so,

4704
02:33:26,960 --> 02:33:27,800
it's so powerful,

4705
02:33:27,801 --> 02:33:28,760
even to this day,

4706
02:33:29,040 --> 02:33:29,873
really.

4707
02:33:29,970 --> 02:33:30,280
It's,

4708
02:33:30,280 --> 02:33:30,550
it's,

4709
02:33:30,550 --> 02:33:31,650
it's so powerful that you,

4710
02:33:31,651 --> 02:33:34,490
you can listen to it and then
watch CNN and not be affected.

4711
02:33:35,150 --> 02:33:36,020
You can reassess,

4712
02:33:36,021 --> 02:33:38,150
reassess the impact of modern media.

4713
02:33:38,240 --> 02:33:38,511
Yeah,

4714
02:33:38,511 --> 02:33:39,290
exactly.

4715
02:33:39,290 --> 02:33:40,360
And that's a very,

4716
02:33:40,450 --> 02:33:43,750
that's a very valuable
one because in fact,

4717
02:33:44,020 --> 02:33:45,760
culture isn't the year friend.

4718
02:33:45,880 --> 02:33:47,200
And a lot of what,

4719
02:33:47,230 --> 02:33:48,063
uh,

4720
02:33:49,190 --> 02:33:50,960
what Terrance's point again,

4721
02:33:51,450 --> 02:33:52,340
think for yourself.

4722
02:33:52,370 --> 02:33:54,740
Don't believe what anybody tells you.

4723
02:33:55,130 --> 02:33:55,640
You know,

4724
02:33:55,640 --> 02:33:58,580
and psychedelics are a challenge to that.

4725
02:33:59,360 --> 02:34:02,460
All these people that dismiss
the psychedelic experience,

4726
02:34:02,461 --> 02:34:03,950
as you rightly point out,

4727
02:34:04,250 --> 02:34:05,360
they haven't had it,

4728
02:34:05,870 --> 02:34:06,320
you know?

4729
02:34:06,320 --> 02:34:07,310
Or if they have,

4730
02:34:07,340 --> 02:34:08,570
they didn't pay attention,

4731
02:34:09,020 --> 02:34:09,440
you know,

4732
02:34:09,440 --> 02:34:10,273
so,

4733
02:34:11,090 --> 02:34:14,390
so their opinions count for nothing.

4734
02:34:14,450 --> 02:34:14,751
I mean,

4735
02:34:14,751 --> 02:34:16,250
they're like the people,

4736
02:34:17,050 --> 02:34:17,321
you know,

4737
02:34:17,321 --> 02:34:18,154
they're like the

4738
02:34:18,340 --> 02:34:21,790
Dutch lens makers who built telescopes,

4739
02:34:21,791 --> 02:34:22,510
but you know,

4740
02:34:22,510 --> 02:34:27,200
refuse to look through the telescopes
because that was a blast from Isac.

4741
02:34:27,490 --> 02:34:28,323
Sure.

4742
02:34:28,840 --> 02:34:29,800
It's the same thing.

4743
02:34:30,130 --> 02:34:32,710
The Brotherhood of the screaming abyss.

4744
02:34:32,740 --> 02:34:34,360
It is available right now.

4745
02:34:34,361 --> 02:34:35,710
I have it in my hand.

4746
02:34:35,740 --> 02:34:40,420
It was all funded through Kickstarter
because people wanted to get this

4747
02:34:40,421 --> 02:34:41,171
information.

4748
02:34:41,171 --> 02:34:41,391
You,

4749
02:34:41,391 --> 02:34:41,660
you,

4750
02:34:41,660 --> 02:34:43,320
you spend a year about a,

4751
02:34:43,380 --> 02:34:43,960
we discussed,

4752
02:34:43,960 --> 02:34:46,150
we talked about this
about December in 2011.

4753
02:34:46,151 --> 02:34:46,720
Right?

4754
02:34:46,720 --> 02:34:48,820
This is when we first
were in contact three.

4755
02:34:49,170 --> 02:34:49,570
Yeah.

4756
02:34:49,570 --> 02:34:50,800
But I actually started,

4757
02:34:50,830 --> 02:34:51,191
well,

4758
02:34:51,191 --> 02:34:53,800
it took about 18 months to write the book.

4759
02:34:54,070 --> 02:34:57,670
I started racing Kickstarter money and uh,

4760
02:34:57,700 --> 02:35:00,070
April of 2011,

4761
02:35:00,280 --> 02:35:00,640
um,

4762
02:35:00,640 --> 02:35:01,210
uh,

4763
02:35:01,210 --> 02:35:02,043
it's taken,

4764
02:35:02,380 --> 02:35:02,940
you know,

4765
02:35:02,940 --> 02:35:05,260
a year and six months to write the book.

4766
02:35:05,410 --> 02:35:07,090
Please ladies and gentlemen,

4767
02:35:07,120 --> 02:35:08,920
go out and buy this book.

4768
02:35:08,921 --> 02:35:09,970
It's fantastic.

4769
02:35:09,971 --> 02:35:11,800
Is the Brotherhood of the screaming abyss.

4770
02:35:11,801 --> 02:35:15,610
If you have not subscribed to
the psychedelics Alon on Itunes,

4771
02:35:15,611 --> 02:35:18,880
go subscribe to that shit
and go and get online.

4772
02:35:18,880 --> 02:35:22,960
And there's a millions of Terrence's
lectures and I don't say millions,

4773
02:35:22,961 --> 02:35:27,130
but at least a hundred there are available
and they're fantastic and they're

4774
02:35:27,131 --> 02:35:28,540
fascinating as is your book.

4775
02:35:28,570 --> 02:35:33,100
Thank you very much for coming down here
has been a real treat and an honor and

4776
02:35:33,101 --> 02:35:33,701
a pleasure.

4777
02:35:33,701 --> 02:35:36,820
And I enjoyed every second of our
conversation and if you ever want to do it

4778
02:35:36,821 --> 02:35:40,540
again and we'll push this fucking
thing until they run out of paper,

4779
02:35:40,570 --> 02:35:42,640
I should mention where it is.

4780
02:35:42,760 --> 02:35:44,710
The easiest way to get it as Amazon,

4781
02:35:44,800 --> 02:35:45,520
there's,

4782
02:35:45,520 --> 02:35:48,490
there's ebooks at the soft cover.

4783
02:35:48,491 --> 02:35:49,570
Books are on Amazon.

4784
02:35:49,571 --> 02:35:50,290
You can order them.

4785
02:35:50,290 --> 02:35:50,950
Yes.

4786
02:35:50,950 --> 02:35:51,783
I got one of those uh,

4787
02:35:51,790 --> 02:35:52,540
kindles.

4788
02:35:52,540 --> 02:35:53,081
That's awesome.

4789
02:35:53,081 --> 02:35:54,160
Just hadn't done it.

4790
02:35:54,161 --> 02:35:54,910
Bang.

4791
02:35:54,910 --> 02:35:56,080
Well thank you so much.

4792
02:35:56,460 --> 02:35:57,020
Pleasure.

4793
02:35:57,020 --> 02:35:58,360
Thoroughly enjoyed this.

4794
02:35:58,390 --> 02:35:58,961
I did too.

4795
02:35:58,961 --> 02:36:00,430
And I think you ate fun.

4796
02:36:00,450 --> 02:36:00,970
Yeah,

4797
02:36:00,970 --> 02:36:01,661
it really has.

4798
02:36:01,661 --> 02:36:03,370
I think you blew a lot
of people's minds too.

4799
02:36:03,400 --> 02:36:06,560
I got to go back and re listen
and Google some shit and,

4800
02:36:06,561 --> 02:36:06,741
and,

4801
02:36:06,741 --> 02:36:08,440
and think about some
things because it was a,

4802
02:36:08,441 --> 02:36:08,750
it was,

4803
02:36:08,750 --> 02:36:09,311
it was awesome.

4804
02:36:09,311 --> 02:36:10,180
It was really a lot of fun.

4805
02:36:10,360 --> 02:36:10,841
Thank you very,

4806
02:36:10,841 --> 02:36:11,201
very much.

4807
02:36:11,201 --> 02:36:14,710
Is there any way people can
give a website if a yes,

4808
02:36:14,740 --> 02:36:15,880
we have a website,

4809
02:36:15,881 --> 02:36:18,760
brotherhood of the screaming
abyss dom with the,

4810
02:36:18,790 --> 02:36:19,960
without the the,

4811
02:36:20,020 --> 02:36:23,440
and that actually we're
opening up a new website.

4812
02:36:24,140 --> 02:36:24,860
Uh,

4813
02:36:24,860 --> 02:36:25,190
it,

4814
02:36:25,190 --> 02:36:25,901
it exists,

4815
02:36:25,901 --> 02:36:27,580
but we're completely revamping it.

4816
02:36:27,610 --> 02:36:28,450
So that's,

4817
02:36:28,600 --> 02:36:29,890
that's already online.

4818
02:36:30,190 --> 02:36:33,390
And just the other day
I launched a dentist,

4819
02:36:33,391 --> 02:36:34,780
j mckenna.com.

4820
02:36:35,470 --> 02:36:36,060
There we go.

4821
02:36:36,060 --> 02:36:36,671
You're on Twitter.

4822
02:36:36,671 --> 02:36:39,070
Are you on Twitter resistant?

4823
02:36:39,071 --> 02:36:40,750
Am according to my daughter.

4824
02:36:41,590 --> 02:36:43,030
I can't access it.

4825
02:36:43,300 --> 02:36:43,661
Oh,

4826
02:36:43,661 --> 02:36:46,960
you're one of those guys
know one of those guys,

4827
02:36:46,961 --> 02:36:47,830
ladies and gentlemen,

4828
02:36:47,831 --> 02:36:49,600
resisting change.

4829
02:36:49,630 --> 02:36:50,320
That's right.

4830
02:36:50,320 --> 02:36:51,990
Existing chain change.

4831
02:36:52,320 --> 02:36:52,790
She,

4832
02:36:52,790 --> 02:36:53,201
she'll,

4833
02:36:53,201 --> 02:36:54,670
she'll get me onto it.

4834
02:36:54,970 --> 02:36:56,710
There's something wrong with a password.

4835
02:36:56,711 --> 02:36:57,544
I don't know.

4836
02:36:57,640 --> 02:36:58,421
Ladies and gentlemen,

4837
02:36:58,421 --> 02:36:59,560
thank you very much.

4838
02:36:59,561 --> 02:37:00,520
Of course.

4839
02:37:00,640 --> 02:37:01,180
Uh,

4840
02:37:01,180 --> 02:37:03,070
we will be back this week.

4841
02:37:03,071 --> 02:37:06,640
We'll be back tomorrow with the great
honey honey band who will be appearing at

4842
02:37:06,641 --> 02:37:08,200
the end of the world show with Doug,

4843
02:37:08,201 --> 02:37:08,681
Stan Hope,

4844
02:37:08,681 --> 02:37:09,940
Joey Diaz and myself.

4845
02:37:09,941 --> 02:37:11,830
That's December 21st,

4846
02:37:11,830 --> 02:37:12,870
2012 at the Wiltern theater.

4847
02:37:13,180 --> 02:37:13,420
Uh,

4848
02:37:13,420 --> 02:37:13,811
like I said,

4849
02:37:13,811 --> 02:37:14,644
I think it was,

4850
02:37:14,740 --> 02:37:16,000
as of the start of this podcast

4851
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:17,390
was about a hundred tickets left for that.

4852
02:37:17,630 --> 02:37:17,990
Uh,

4853
02:37:17,990 --> 02:37:19,220
this Thursday night,

4854
02:37:19,270 --> 02:37:19,700
uh,

4855
02:37:19,700 --> 02:37:21,890
the Improv in Hollywood.

4856
02:37:21,950 --> 02:37:22,140
You,

4857
02:37:22,140 --> 02:37:24,320
they could watch it live
on Ustream at Ustream.

4858
02:37:24,321 --> 02:37:24,421
Dot.

4859
02:37:24,421 --> 02:37:24,760
[inaudible]

4860
02:37:24,760 --> 02:37:25,810
I will try and do it live.

4861
02:37:25,811 --> 02:37:26,081
If not,

4862
02:37:26,081 --> 02:37:27,580
it will be recorded to Vimeo.

4863
02:37:27,620 --> 02:37:30,760
Abida we're going to try to do a
podcast upstairs and do a comedy show

4864
02:37:30,761 --> 02:37:31,481
downstairs.

4865
02:37:31,481 --> 02:37:35,020
Just like Joey Diaz would be
their ideas and most likely me,

4866
02:37:35,050 --> 02:37:35,883
most likely you.

4867
02:37:36,090 --> 02:37:39,220
I think I'm gonna try to
get Ari or Doug's dad hope.

4868
02:37:39,221 --> 02:37:39,821
If he's in town,

4869
02:37:39,821 --> 02:37:40,850
Dunkin can do it right.

4870
02:37:40,870 --> 02:37:41,381
They can do it.

4871
02:37:41,381 --> 02:37:41,741
But yeah,

4872
02:37:41,741 --> 02:37:42,670
I'll get some people together.

4873
02:37:43,010 --> 02:37:45,670
Some quality desk waters if
you want to buy the tee shirts.

4874
02:37:45,671 --> 02:37:46,151
Death Squad.

4875
02:37:46,151 --> 02:37:46,980
Dot Tv

4876
02:37:46,980 --> 02:37:47,340
if you want it.

4877
02:37:47,340 --> 02:37:47,431
Oh,

4878
02:37:47,431 --> 02:37:47,850
this is,

4879
02:37:47,850 --> 02:37:48,451
this is actually,

4880
02:37:48,451 --> 02:37:52,050
this is a higher primates show
that's actually based on the,

4881
02:37:52,070 --> 02:37:52,560
uh,

4882
02:37:52,560 --> 02:37:56,250
based on the [inaudible]
Terrence's stoned ape theory.

4883
02:37:56,251 --> 02:38:01,251
It's a chimp with a mushroom in his mouth
and on his left hand is a floating ohm

4884
02:38:01,920 --> 02:38:04,470
and the right hand is the
symbol for nuclear energy.

4885
02:38:04,540 --> 02:38:04,660
Oh,

4886
02:38:04,660 --> 02:38:05,670
that's just lovely.

4887
02:38:06,710 --> 02:38:08,130
Come on son with a,

4888
02:38:08,131 --> 02:38:12,600
and he's also got a third eye with like
some geometric shit coming out of it.

4889
02:38:12,630 --> 02:38:13,291
I'll get you one of these.

4890
02:38:13,291 --> 02:38:14,124
Would you rock it?

4891
02:38:14,190 --> 02:38:14,371
Oh,

4892
02:38:14,371 --> 02:38:14,840
you bet.

4893
02:38:14,840 --> 02:38:15,371
Would I take,

4894
02:38:15,371 --> 02:38:17,070
if we take a picture of you wearing this,

4895
02:38:17,280 --> 02:38:17,870
we'll sell it.

4896
02:38:17,870 --> 02:38:19,370
Fuck up a thousand of these bitches.

4897
02:38:19,390 --> 02:38:19,830
Okay.

4898
02:38:19,830 --> 02:38:20,041
All right.

4899
02:38:20,041 --> 02:38:20,874
Listen,

4900
02:38:21,360 --> 02:38:22,620
if you ever need anything promoted,

4901
02:38:22,621 --> 02:38:23,700
please let us know.

4902
02:38:23,701 --> 02:38:24,061
And again,

4903
02:38:24,061 --> 02:38:24,661
one more time,

4904
02:38:24,661 --> 02:38:25,110
folks.

4905
02:38:25,110 --> 02:38:26,640
The Brotherhood of the screaming abyss.

4906
02:38:26,760 --> 02:38:28,710
We will be back to Mara with honey,

4907

4909
02:38:32,880 --> 02:38:33,181
That's what?

4910
02:38:33,181 --> 02:38:34,014
300 episodes.

4911
02:38:34,020 --> 02:38:34,853
Oh Shit,

4912
02:38:34,940 --> 02:38:35,773
bitches.

4913
02:38:35,970 --> 02:38:37,320
So that's a great way to do it.

4914
02:38:37,321 --> 02:38:37,501
All right.

4915
02:38:37,501 --> 02:38:39,690
We love the shit out of you
guys and we'll see you tomorrow.

4916
02:38:39,810 --> 02:38:40,643
Bye Bye.

4917
02:38:50,820 --> 02:38:50,920
Hmm.
