1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Four three,
two,

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,660
one.
Hello?

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:10,890
Hello.
What's up buddy?

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,900
There's discrepancy.
My,

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,780
my coffee is way,
way bigger than yours.

6
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:20,010
I've got like this 40 ounce big gulp.
French press.

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,470
Yes.
Versus the,

8
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:25,650
is that a caveman cold brew?
Nitros yeah,

9
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,570
those are pretty good too.
It was called punch.

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,180
Yeah.
Thank you so much for the bread and the

11
00:00:30,181 --> 00:00:33,810
Ma rooms and goodies.
That's awesome.

12
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,910
I would probably be morbidly obese if I
wasn't an exercise freak.

13
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,620
It seems like that.
Yeah.

14
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:43,290
Yeah.
Just so makes that sour dough bread and

15
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:47,160
it is freaking amazing.
Did you do that carnivore diet thing?

16
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:48,480
Did you try that out?
No.

17
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:49,350
You did.
No,

18
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:50,220
no.
I like me,

19
00:00:50,221 --> 00:00:52,980
but I didn't do the cardboard that you
were going to do it for a certain amount

20
00:00:52,981 --> 00:00:56,070
of time and test it.
Thought about it too much of a foodie.

21
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:00,210
I like,
what I did was I tried to eat Ribeye

22
00:01:00,211 --> 00:01:05,211
steaks every night for dinner,
so I did like a 33% carnivore diet,

23
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,790
but there was a study actually that came
out.

24
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:13,790
It was just like two days ago on that
Tmao the the sugar that is associated

25
00:01:14,131 --> 00:01:18,510
with gut damage when you're eating a
high red meat diet,

26
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,630
right.
When your body takes excess protein and

27
00:01:21,631 --> 00:01:23,250
it turns it into sugar,
right.

28
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,450
With theoretically the idea of being
that that might be present because your

29
00:01:27,451 --> 00:01:31,530
microbiome is imbalanced from a diet
that's too heavy and meat.

30
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:34,710
Is there a microfiber?
It's because you're buying them.

31
00:01:34,711 --> 00:01:38,580
I thought it was just because of
glucogenesis because your body has

32
00:01:38,581 --> 00:01:41,910
nothing but meet your body,
turns it into glucose.

33
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:42,960
No,
that,

34
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,070
that would be something different.
That that conversion of glucose is a

35
00:01:47,071 --> 00:01:52,071
different sugar than the Tmao Tmao is,
is that's going to be present if you

36
00:01:52,831 --> 00:01:56,280
aren't getting enough fiber or if you're
buying on his own balanced.

37
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:00,690
But what this study a couple of days
looked at was people who were eating

38
00:02:00,691 --> 00:02:05,691
like a fish and egg and plant rich diet,
and they had high levels of Tmao too,

39
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,130
but they weren't deleterious there
actually as of tech because it had the

40
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:11,964
fiber.

41
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,620
Yeah,
and I mean you could do,

42
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,010
you could do a carnivore diet if you
were there.

43
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:19,110
There's a few populations that do this.
Like in Spain,

44
00:02:19,111 --> 00:02:21,450
I forget the name of the sausage,
but they'll like eat the,

45
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:24,150
they'll eat the ruminant,
like delete the intestine of the

46
00:02:24,151 --> 00:02:27,930
ruminant and get their grasses and their
fibers and their plants literally by

47
00:02:27,931 --> 00:02:30,090
eating the stomach of the animal.
But like a cat.

48
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:30,970
Yeah.
Yeah.

49
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:32,900
And it's the same issue with like,
uh,

50
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,460
you know,
Mathias seen too much of the amino acid

51
00:02:35,461 --> 00:02:39,750
methionine from just eating red meat
would be deleterious.

52
00:02:39,751 --> 00:02:42,930
But if you're getting glycine and some
of these other amino acids,

53
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,320
if you're reading like nose to tail,
bone marrow,

54
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,630
bone broth,
all the organ meats,

55
00:02:48,631 --> 00:02:49,650
you know,
head cheese,

56
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:53,040
braunschweiger just like all of these
different mixes of meats,

57
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,530
I think that would be the way to do a
car more diet.

58
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,060
Yeah.
This is a lot of people that are

59
00:02:57,061 --> 00:02:59,930
proponents of that as well.
And then there's a bunch of people that

60
00:02:59,931 --> 00:03:00,340
are,

61
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,660
you know,
it's interesting because you've got to,

62
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:06,580
there's a disparity between the
anecdotal accounts of health and

63
00:03:06,581 --> 00:03:10,900
wellbeing and then blood work.
The blood work these folks get is not

64
00:03:10,901 --> 00:03:13,210
impressive.
You mean the people on the cardboard?

65
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,530
Yeah.
What I've seen,

66
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,460
I haven't seen anything where I see all
their inflammatory markers down their

67
00:03:18,461 --> 00:03:21,160
testosterone up.
I haven't seen anything where it's

68
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:24,790
looking really good.
High Blood Glucose is another thing that

69
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:28,090
you see what I should say that there
haven't been a lot of tests done.

70
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,310
It's not,
a lot of people are publishing stuff on

71
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:32,560
it,
but the anecdotal evidence is amazing.

72
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:33,790
It's like,
it's really weird.

73
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:34,330
Like,
uh,

74
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:38,080
my friend Jordan Peterson,
he's had a tremendous success with it,

75
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:42,400
lost a lot of body weight.
He says he's in his intellectual prime.

76
00:03:42,401 --> 00:03:46,060
He said he's never felt better in terms
of his energy levels and that guy is,

77
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:48,360
he is so rigid and disciplined with it
all.

78
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,150
He's eating his meat with salt on it and
he drinks water and that is slowly,

79
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,520
well,
if you think about it,

80
00:03:54,521 --> 00:03:56,160
it's an elimination diet,
right?

81
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:58,810
It's like an autoimmune diet or you can
say,

82
00:03:58,811 --> 00:03:59,650
well,
you know,

83
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,670
I don't know what's giving me trouble.
Soy or wheat or dairy or what have you.

84
00:04:03,671 --> 00:04:07,060
So I'm just going to stop eating all
that stuff and switched to primarily

85
00:04:07,061 --> 00:04:11,470
meet.
The problem is that it's know I don't

86
00:04:11,471 --> 00:04:13,240
want to call anybody out and,
and,

87
00:04:13,241 --> 00:04:14,860
and,
and call them lazy,

88
00:04:14,861 --> 00:04:19,861
but it's almost like kind of a very easy
lazy esque approach because rather than

89
00:04:20,531 --> 00:04:23,590
figuring out how to do that,
that sourdough bread,

90
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:27,760
it's slow fermented.
The Rye and the wheat are in there,

91
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:32,020
but all the phytic acid that would
normally inhibit your ability to absorb

92
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:36,970
minerals is pre digested by the lacto
bash list and all the bacteria in the

93
00:04:36,971 --> 00:04:37,630
wheat.

94
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:41,200
So you've got a bread that's lower on
the glycemic index and it's,

95
00:04:41,201 --> 00:04:46,201
it's more easily digested with some of
some of the dry and salad or more

96
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,021
health.
Right.

97
00:04:47,021 --> 00:04:50,470
And you put the Ryan it because it
lowers the glycemic index and then

98
00:04:50,471 --> 00:04:51,910
you've got the,
um,

99
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,040
uh,
what's it called?

100
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:54,850
The,
uh,

101
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:55,960
the,
uh,

102
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,410
I forget the term,
uh,

103
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,290
a,
it's like a gluten digesting enzyme that

104
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:01,620
gets activated with the lacto bachelor
lists.

105
00:05:01,621 --> 00:05:05,770
So that's a smart bread.
I mean it takes fricken 24 hours to,

106
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,090
it's,
it's not 24 hours,

107
00:05:07,091 --> 00:05:09,850
but it's like 15 minutes over 24 hours
that it takes to make it.

108
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,750
That's an intelligent approach to food
preparation,

109
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:15,880
right?
That's the way that our ancestors or

110
00:05:15,881 --> 00:05:18,970
many of the blue zones would have
treated their foods fermenting,

111
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,560
soaking,
sprouting,

112
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:23,140
slow food,
and you can take a lot of these things

113
00:05:23,141 --> 00:05:24,320
that would result in,
you know,

114
00:05:24,321 --> 00:05:27,770
you're talking about Jordan Peterson,
I know his daughter does this as well,

115
00:05:27,771 --> 00:05:31,780
and mckayla Peterson,
they use that elimination diet,

116
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:35,320
which is the carnivore diet to clear up
a lot of those autoimmune issues.

117
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:40,620
But you could also just render food more
digestible or switch to an elimination

118
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:44,620
diet or an autoimmune diet for eight
weeks or 12 weeks,

119
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,230
something like the Carnivore Diet,
heal the gut,

120
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:51,490
and then return back to a more all
inclusive eating pattern that allows you

121
00:05:51,491 --> 00:05:52,324
to eat,
you know,

122
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:55,030
dairy,
wheat plants,

123
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,500
et cetera.
All these things that would normally

124
00:05:56,501 --> 00:05:57,590
damage the gut

125
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,360
if the gut is actually

126
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:02,130
Wiki.
So what are the,

127
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:04,440
like what,
what's the process like?

128
00:06:04,441 --> 00:06:08,100
What is happening when they go on this?
Very strict elimination diet and they're

129
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:11,130
just eating meat,
like what is happening to their gut that

130
00:06:11,131 --> 00:06:14,940
allows him to have all these pretty
pretty significant health benefits.

131
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:17,730
A lot of loss of weight,
increase of energy,

132
00:06:17,731 --> 00:06:20,910
autoimmune issues like Jordan had some,
um,

133
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,940
some pretty significant gum issues.
Those all went away.

134
00:06:23,941 --> 00:06:25,410
Depression,
that went away,

135
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:26,670
right?

136
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:29,640
Some of that,
some of the gum in the joint stuff might

137
00:06:29,641 --> 00:06:33,360
be just as much related to the fact that
he's getting a shit ton of college and

138
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:37,610
you know,
fiber eye or not fiber but odd elastin

139
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,650
and muscle fiber precursors.
He's getting a lot of protein.

140
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,320
I don't know if he's eating bone broth
and bone marrow,

141
00:06:43,321 --> 00:06:45,960
but maybe a lot of glycine,
some of these other metabolites.

142
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:51,260
So part of it could just be more fuel on
board to repair muscles or to repair the

143
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:54,000
joints.
But then the other part of it is that

144
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:57,360
when you eliminate inflammatory products
that you're consuming,

145
00:06:57,361 --> 00:06:59,640
like let's say you're eating whatever,
you know,

146
00:06:59,641 --> 00:07:03,960
wonder bread and commercial dairy or,
or unfermented soy or any of these

147
00:07:03,961 --> 00:07:05,970
things that can actually damage the
lining of the gut.

148
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,760
You're creating an inflammatory scenario
and I know you're,

149
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:12,720
you're familiar with the gut brain
access and how our gut interacts with

150
00:07:12,721 --> 00:07:16,020
our nervous system via the vagus nerve
and when you have inflammation in the

151
00:07:16,021 --> 00:07:18,910
gut that affects neural symptoms that
affect sleep,

152
00:07:18,911 --> 00:07:20,970
it affects intellectual performance.

153
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,130
And then you've also got the autoimmune
component.

154
00:07:23,131 --> 00:07:27,570
If you're actually truly allergic to or
intolerant to some of those proteins

155
00:07:27,571 --> 00:07:30,840
that wind up in the bloodstream in the
presence of a leaky gut,

156
00:07:30,841 --> 00:07:32,160
you know,
plant proteins,

157
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:34,260
uh,
lectins are another one that a lot of

158
00:07:34,261 --> 00:07:39,240
people complain about.
Then you create almost like a full body

159
00:07:39,241 --> 00:07:42,750
damaged scenario.
So the idea is you get rid of all that

160
00:07:42,751 --> 00:07:45,450
stuff.
You introduced the carnivore diet and I

161
00:07:45,451 --> 00:07:47,730
don't know that there's a lot of
components of the carnivore diet that

162
00:07:47,731 --> 00:07:51,750
are actually healing the gut as much as
it's the absence or elimination of the

163
00:07:51,751 --> 00:07:52,680
foods that were harming it.

164
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,150
Hmm.
Interesting.

165
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:54,570
The,
you know,

166
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:55,620
the,
the bell brothers,

167
00:07:55,621 --> 00:07:56,800
Chris and mark,
do you know those guys?

168
00:07:56,801 --> 00:07:57,590
Yeah,
yeah.

169
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:00,660
Um,
their take on it is basically they've

170
00:08:00,661 --> 00:08:02,250
never felt better.
And you know,

171
00:08:02,251 --> 00:08:04,320
these are guys that work out very
heavily.

172
00:08:04,321 --> 00:08:07,450
The difference between them and Jordan
is probably that especially if you know

173
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:11,550
mark is a gorilla,
he's power lifting and you know it has

174
00:08:11,551 --> 00:08:13,110
been doing that basically his whole
life.

175
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:17,760
These guys are what their take on it is
essentially there.

176
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:22,910
At least the way they think is that most
people that are talking about diet,

177
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:25,200
they really don't know what the fuck
they're talking about.

178
00:08:25,201 --> 00:08:28,830
Even though you might be able to look at
it on paper and you might have these

179
00:08:28,831 --> 00:08:31,320
ideas about what's beneficial or non
beneficial.

180
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,450
Some people are proponents of Vegan
diets,

181
00:08:33,451 --> 00:08:35,850
some people were proponents of you know
Paleo.

182
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,100
He's like until you are actually
physically doing something until you are

183
00:08:41,101 --> 00:08:44,100
actually doing something with that diet
and then you report how much better you

184
00:08:44,101 --> 00:08:46,410
feel that the people that are actually
training really hard,

185
00:08:46,411 --> 00:08:49,650
those are the ones you should rely on.
And he's saying for him personally,

186
00:08:49,651 --> 00:08:51,780
he's never felt better.
Never been leaner.

187
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,040
Yeah.
And a big part of it,

188
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:57,480
I mean this just returns to
personalization and customization as a

189
00:08:57,481 --> 00:08:59,220
whole.
You know we live in an era where you can

190
00:08:59,221 --> 00:09:03,180
self quantify pretty easily with
genetics and you can find out what

191
00:09:03,181 --> 00:09:06,180
ancestry you came from,
what blood markers that you have,

192
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:11,210
what your gut microbiome looks like.
And I don't think we talked about this

193
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,680
on the last show,
but there's this idea of eating

194
00:09:13,681 --> 00:09:18,180
according to your ancestry and the
concept of what are called cold spots.

195
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,240
Like areas around the world where people
have a genetic susceptibility to have

196
00:09:23,371 --> 00:09:26,640
certain diseases that they don't
actually develop.

197
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:31,020
Those diseases don't actually manifest
because of their traditional diet.

198
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:34,320
Like you look at like the Icelandic
population that carries the genes that

199
00:09:34,321 --> 00:09:38,310
would render them more susceptible to
something like depression or seasonal

200
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:41,730
effective disorder.
But their diet is very rich in omega

201
00:09:41,731 --> 00:09:45,630
three fatty acids and Dha,
which we know can protect against those

202
00:09:45,631 --> 00:09:46,200
disorders.

203
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,660
And then you take,
take the Icelandic population and you

204
00:09:48,661 --> 00:09:52,080
uproot them and put them in the context
of a westernized diet and all of a

205
00:09:52,081 --> 00:09:55,620
sudden depression and sad manifests.
That's interesting.

206
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:58,410
So the same thing for like a Cameroon,
Cameroon,

207
00:09:58,411 --> 00:10:00,480
Africa,
higher than normal risk for colon

208
00:10:00,481 --> 00:10:03,960
cancer,
but they're eating a diet that's high in

209
00:10:03,961 --> 00:10:06,420
fiber.
Why is it higher than normal risk?

210
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,051
Well,
I don't know.

211
00:10:07,051 --> 00:10:11,430
It's a genetic susceptibility,
but the idea is that that population

212
00:10:11,431 --> 00:10:15,750
probably figured out at some point in
human history that if they eat a lot of

213
00:10:15,751 --> 00:10:19,080
plants or they eat a lot of fiber,
all of a sudden people don't have as

214
00:10:19,081 --> 00:10:20,670
many issues with their colon.
Right,

215
00:10:20,671 --> 00:10:22,590
and then you take that same population
again,

216
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,050
strip out the fiber,
put them on a westernized diet,

217
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,800
and you get a large portion of the
African American population developing

218
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:29,693
colon cancer.

219
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:33,660
That's crazy about the seasonal
affective disorder and you've got to

220
00:10:33,661 --> 00:10:36,060
wonder how would that affect people that
live in Seattle,

221
00:10:36,061 --> 00:10:38,640
the Pacific northwest that are dealing
with constant rain.

222
00:10:38,641 --> 00:10:41,400
I wonder if that would have some sort of
an impact on them.

223
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:43,920
Probably even more if you come from that
population.

224
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,450
I mean,
I'm on the spokane side,

225
00:10:45,451 --> 00:10:49,800
but I'm out in the middle of the forest.
I get Sun for maybe 10 to two and I'm on

226
00:10:49,801 --> 00:10:52,680
a north facing slope and I work in doors
a lot of the time.

227
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:54,210
You know,
I'm typing on my computer,

228
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,630
uh,
um,

229
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,920
blogging and so I don't get a lot of sun
exposure,

230
00:10:58,921 --> 00:11:00,310
but that's where,
you know,

231
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:04,950
all these new fangled light panels and
head worn light devices and things come

232
00:11:04,951 --> 00:11:07,510
in that were actually developed for
seasonal affective disorder,

233
00:11:07,511 --> 00:11:10,800
that actually worked pretty well just to
keep your mood up if you're working in

234
00:11:10,801 --> 00:11:12,180
doors and you'll get sunlight exposure.

235
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:14,070
Right.
But spokane has a different environment,

236
00:11:14,071 --> 00:11:15,450
right?
You're not dealing with the constant

237
00:11:15,451 --> 00:11:17,370
rain that they're dealing with on the
actual coast.

238
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:21,480
Now the precipitation builds up on the,
on the mountains and then dumps back on

239
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:22,380
in Seattle.
Yeah.

240
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:25,230
I mean it's still must be,
you must get much more than you get in

241
00:11:25,231 --> 00:11:27,510
California or southern California at
least.

242
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,440
But,
uh,

243
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,970
it's,
it was supposed to be very beautiful out

244
00:11:29,971 --> 00:11:30,560
there.
It's,

245
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,830
it's gorgeous.
So I'm about 25 minutes from coeur

246
00:11:33,831 --> 00:11:35,190
d'alene.
Oh really?

247
00:11:35,191 --> 00:11:35,940
Yeah.
Okay.

248
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,560
Yeah.
That's amazing.

249
00:11:37,561 --> 00:11:38,730
I've never bought lines.
Beautiful.

250
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:41,770
I used to go over there and race the
ironman and they,

251
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,700
they'd have that in Lake quarter lane.
It's an iconic race just because,

252
00:11:44,701 --> 00:11:46,320
I mean the mountains,
the lake,

253
00:11:46,321 --> 00:11:49,470
everything is just gorgeous.
I saw pictures of the lake where people

254
00:11:49,471 --> 00:11:52,140
were taking photographs of the bottom of
the leg,

255
00:11:52,141 --> 00:11:54,640
like from a hundred a hundred feet deep
of water.

256
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,040
You could see the bottom of the lake and
stack.

257
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:56,913
Yeah.
Yeah.

258
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,260
That is insane.
It's kind of funny because it's actually

259
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:01,330
polluted because of all the mines of the
head around there.

260
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,880
Like there's a lot of metals in it.
Cause the quarter Lane Fijian,

261
00:12:03,881 --> 00:12:06,820
the spokane river.
And you're at your allotment of fish

262
00:12:06,821 --> 00:12:08,620
that you're supposed to eat from the
spokane rivers,

263
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:10,050
like one a year.
Why?

264
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:12,730
Like it's that high in metals.
So I mean,

265
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:14,300
I don't eat any,
I don't want,

266
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:17,260
I don't choose to go down there and
that's awful.

267
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:18,940
Yeah.
Dammit.

268
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:20,980
Yeah.
But it's a beautiful lake.

269
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,770
I mean it's,
what is the allotment of fish that

270
00:12:23,771 --> 00:12:25,360
you're supposed to eat from the leg?
Because it's similar.

271
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,860
I don't know.
I don't know.

272
00:12:26,861 --> 00:12:28,870
But if I,
if I went to quarterly and I spent a lot

273
00:12:28,871 --> 00:12:31,060
of time swimming there,
I'd probably spend some time in the

274
00:12:31,061 --> 00:12:33,490
infrared sauna to some of those metals
out.

275
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:36,460
So let me ask you this.
What's the benefit of infrared sauna

276
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,620
versus traditional sauna?
Is there a benefit?

277
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,590
So the,
the idea is it's cooler,

278
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,360
you know you have an infrared here?
No.

279
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:48,340
So you walk into the infrared,
it's like 155 258 degrees.

280
00:12:48,341 --> 00:12:49,870
Most of them,
there's a couple of that'll go up to

281
00:12:49,871 --> 00:12:53,830
like one 70 even though the air is
cooler,

282
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:58,390
the actual photons of light that are
being released by the panels,

283
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:00,490
you're,
you're surrounded by infrared panels

284
00:13:00,491 --> 00:13:03,460
while you're in there.
Those penetrate more deeply into tissue.

285
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,820
So you wind up getting a deeper sweat.
You sweat for a longer time,

286
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,700
you can stay in there longer because
it's not quite as hot.

287
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:13,540
But you look at like the studies out of
Finland,

288
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,300
right?
These,

289
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:18,220
these studies that show four to five
year lifespan increases from a,

290
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,590
from a weekly sauna protocol of,
you know,

291
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:23,020
I think it's like four times a week for
20 to 30 minutes.

292
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:24,250
Uh,
and the,

293
00:13:24,251 --> 00:13:28,780
and the significant drop in dementia and
Alzheimer's and a lot of these,

294
00:13:28,781 --> 00:13:32,530
these mortality risk factors.
And you look at the studies that have

295
00:13:32,531 --> 00:13:34,740
been done,
an athletes where you get almost a

296
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:38,080
[inaudible] and like,
like a blood doping effect from sauna

297
00:13:38,081 --> 00:13:41,950
exposure when done postworkout right.
You stay in there for 20 to 30 minutes

298
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:45,430
workout.
All of these were done in a dry sauna.

299
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:50,410
That's why I use a dry sauna as per
Rhonda Patrick's recommendation.

300
00:13:50,411 --> 00:13:53,800
I just got that cause she said there's
no real studies like that on an

301
00:13:53,801 --> 00:13:55,730
infrared.
There's a few metal that,

302
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,340
so they,
they've analyzed metal and

303
00:13:57,341 --> 00:14:00,730
detoxification and some of these
infrared saunas and they have found that

304
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,860
that you release more through your
sweat,

305
00:14:02,861 --> 00:14:05,980
you get a deeper sweat.
So if your goal is something like

306
00:14:05,981 --> 00:14:10,360
detoxification,
theoretically when I'm in that I'm

307
00:14:10,361 --> 00:14:13,510
fucking drenched.
Like how could I get more out of that?

308
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:17,170
Have you tried like a like trial,
like a 30 minute infrared versus the

309
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:18,103
dry?
I have,

310
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:21,250
I,
I'm an idiot so uh,

311
00:14:21,251 --> 00:14:24,100
I don't feel like I'm suffering as much
so I don't like it.

312
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,010
When you're in the infrared you don't
feel like yourself.

313
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:26,831
Exactly.
Yeah.

314
00:14:26,831 --> 00:14:30,190
See that's the thing is,
and maybe I'm jaded because when I'm my

315
00:14:30,191 --> 00:14:31,360
infrared,
like I've got a,

316
00:14:31,361 --> 00:14:35,200
I've got a kettle bell in there.
I've put my bike in their yoga in there.

317
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,240
When I go in there at night,
it actually,

318
00:14:37,241 --> 00:14:38,650
like I was telling you were talking
about those,

319
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:40,480
those massage devices,
those,

320
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:45,850
the sls,
the ones that are like a pso rit or like

321
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:47,580
a shift in your abs,
those things.

322
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,750
But they open up,
they open up.

323
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,740
You can work on a lot of body parts

324
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,560
anyway,
so I'll have stuff like that and there

325
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:57,590
and occasionally do bodywork,
but I actually move,

326
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:01,850
I exercise in the Sauna Sauna that's
designed for that.

327
00:15:01,851 --> 00:15:05,760
What the fuck is that called again?
There's a specific sauna that a lot of a

328
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:10,250
UFC guys are using or in Vegas and
they're building them in gyms.

329
00:15:10,251 --> 00:15:11,810
I know a winkle,
Johns,

330
00:15:11,811 --> 00:15:12,644
Jim,
Mike.

331
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,290
It's kind of like a TV panel in there.
Yeah,

332
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:18,470
they have televisions in there.
So you can even watch things like watch

333
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:23,180
like a directionals or watch some sort
of a instructional video on exercise.

334
00:15:23,181 --> 00:15:24,380
Yeah,
that's what I think they're doing is

335
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:26,030
they're trying to have you do your
workout.

336
00:15:26,031 --> 00:15:29,060
Like you look at a screen and the sauna
and you do your workout while you're

337
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:30,580
looking at the screen.
It's on the spot.

338
00:15:30,581 --> 00:15:32,540
I think it's called fit spa,
something like that.

339
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:34,150
But the,
um,

340
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:38,000
the,
the hot one that I go into mean I sweat

341
00:15:38,001 --> 00:15:38,630
so much.

342
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:41,450
I have a hard time believing I would
sweat more anywhere else.

343
00:15:41,451 --> 00:15:43,880
I mean,
I'm literally pouring sweat and I keep

344
00:15:43,881 --> 00:15:46,160
that fucker around 190 degrees.
Yeah.

345
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:49,670
So I'm,
I'm really feeling ideal scenario.

346
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,290
I would like it.
I don't have a dry sauna,

347
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:55,370
but I would like to get a barrel sauna
because I have the infrared in my

348
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:56,810
basement.
It's one of those big ones,

349
00:15:56,811 --> 00:16:00,080
like the foreperson,
infrared sauna and that you can get into

350
00:16:00,081 --> 00:16:01,100
an exercise.
You can,

351
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:02,930
you can yoga more people in there.
You know,

352
00:16:02,931 --> 00:16:03,880
do yoga,
whatnot,

353
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:04,341
and I'm,
you know,

354
00:16:04,341 --> 00:16:08,180
I'm six two but I can get into like a
full down dog into a laundry or

355
00:16:08,181 --> 00:16:10,280
whatever,
but I'd love to have a dry sauna as

356
00:16:10,281 --> 00:16:13,190
well.
What is embarrassed on a barrel sauna

357
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,320
is,
it's like a big barrel.

358
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,970
You've probably seen them before.
They're,

359
00:16:16,971 --> 00:16:17,810
um,
I don't think so.

360
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,690
They got benches on either side.
They're shaped like a,

361
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,440
like a cylinder.
Uh,

362
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:24,410
they're,
they're very popular.

363
00:16:24,411 --> 00:16:27,140
They build up a lot of heat.
I think even the shape of the barrel

364
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:29,990
somehow allows the heat to be
distributed more evenly through the

365
00:16:29,991 --> 00:16:31,190
sauna or something like that.
You know,

366
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:33,500
almost almost like a traeger grill,
for example.

367
00:16:33,501 --> 00:16:34,191
Okay.
So this is,

368
00:16:34,191 --> 00:16:35,010
uh,
yeah,

369
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:37,820
so that's like,
yeah.

370
00:16:37,821 --> 00:16:40,760
So I've got,
what I did was I bought one of those,

371
00:16:40,761 --> 00:16:42,830
um,
those endless pools that you swim

372
00:16:42,831 --> 00:16:43,641
against.
Jamie,

373
00:16:43,641 --> 00:16:46,100
go to that one in the upper right hand
corner with the bubble on the outside of

374
00:16:46,101 --> 00:16:47,390
it.
That looks fucking awesome.

375
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:48,970
Yeah,
keep that sucker in your back yard.

376
00:16:48,971 --> 00:16:53,971
I was at a guy's house in Santa Monica
at that thing and it heats up the same

377
00:16:55,191 --> 00:16:57,200
way that some sort of a power source
attached to that.

378
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:59,390
Yeah,
that's pretty bad ass.

379
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:02,000
See I want to get one of those and just
put it out in the forest where I can

380
00:17:02,001 --> 00:17:04,220
look out with the zoo or barrel song.
Yeah.

381
00:17:04,221 --> 00:17:06,200
Looks fucking cool.
Yeah,

382
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,280
yeah,
yeah.

383
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:10,510
Especially if you were in like a cold
area and you could like,

384
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,410
like that,
look at that guys getting set up looking

385
00:17:12,411 --> 00:17:14,570
over a leg.
You could look out into the snow.

386
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:19,610
Serene.
It's pretty like a pastoral scene in the

387
00:17:19,991 --> 00:17:22,670
Cryo after you do the sauna.
I get sometimes.

388
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:23,900
Uh,
but most days,

389
00:17:23,901 --> 00:17:26,750
no,
most days I do either or yesterday I did

390
00:17:26,751 --> 00:17:28,250
cry.
Yeah,

391
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,190
yeah,
yeah.

392
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,920
I've,
I've been doing cryo everyday cause I'm

393
00:17:30,921 --> 00:17:33,740
staying down at the Hilton and they have
a a crowd therapy chamber there.

394
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:35,900
Oh No.
I'm a bigger fan of the cold wave at the

395
00:17:35,901 --> 00:17:37,530
Hilton.
Wasn't cryotherapy.

396
00:17:37,531 --> 00:17:39,430
Yeah.
They've got a cryotherapy chamber.

397
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:41,240
They've got,
they've got a funny,

398
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:45,440
they have like this thing called upgrade
labs and like the basement of this,

399
00:17:45,441 --> 00:17:48,650
uh,
this Hilton got like a Cryo,

400
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:50,220
they've got an infrared sauna,

401
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,620
they've got subject.
I've just been going down there every

402
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,420
day and working out my workout this
morning.

403
00:17:54,421 --> 00:17:58,470
Actually I did this machine,
they've got a machine called a vasper.

404
00:17:58,471 --> 00:17:59,730
Have you seen this before?
No.

405
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,370
You put like,
it's got cold cuffs.

406
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,690
You,
you know Kaatsu training,

407
00:18:03,691 --> 00:18:05,070
like blood flow restriction training,
right?

408
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:10,260
So you put cold cuffs on your arms and
then you put cold cuffs on your legs and

409
00:18:10,261 --> 00:18:13,470
it increased the millimeters of mercury
and tell you're basically get less blood

410
00:18:13,471 --> 00:18:16,410
flow to your arms and your legs.
And then it's one of these full body

411
00:18:16,411 --> 00:18:17,640
exercise devices,
right?

412
00:18:17,641 --> 00:18:19,200
So you're moving your arms and your
legs,

413
00:18:19,201 --> 00:18:22,680
like an elliptical trainer.
You're barefoot and the whole thing is

414
00:18:22,681 --> 00:18:25,080
cold.
So it's pumping cold water through the

415
00:18:25,081 --> 00:18:27,600
blood pressure cuffs on your arms and
your legs.

416
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:32,290
And then it's got cold water back behind
you on the areas right here watching

417
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:32,580
this.

418
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,410
Uh,
and by the way,

419
00:18:34,411 --> 00:18:35,880
this,
this thing is not going to make you an

420
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:37,890
athlete.
Like that's not the purpose of a,

421
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,810
of something.
Like what is the purpose of it?

422
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:41,340
Just general fitness.
You know,

423
00:18:41,341 --> 00:18:44,070
you're,
you're getting cold and when you take

424
00:18:44,071 --> 00:18:47,970
off the blood pressure cuffs,
what happens is you've got a bunch of

425
00:18:47,971 --> 00:18:50,310
lactic acid trapped in the muscle.
As you're,

426
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:53,100
as you're moving in,
typically you're doing like 30 seconds

427
00:18:53,101 --> 00:18:55,920
as hard as you can go see Miko,
I mean pretty heavy wattage,

428
00:18:55,921 --> 00:19:00,921
like 600 800 watts for 15 to 30 seconds
and then you recover and when you finish

429
00:19:01,621 --> 00:19:05,550
and you take those cuffs off,
you get this amplification in growth

430
00:19:05,551 --> 00:19:07,710
hormone,
testosterone.

431
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:10,200
And based on some of the research
they're talking about now,

432
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:12,430
stem cell mobilization.
So that,

433
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,910
and it's like this,
this super quick 21 minute workout.

434
00:19:14,911 --> 00:19:16,290
I actually want to get one from my
house.

435
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,640
And how long has the amplification of
testosterone and growth hormone and all

436
00:19:20,641 --> 00:19:22,650
that stuff?
I don't know.

437
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:26,490
I mean in many cases,
I mean it's like a lot of things that

438
00:19:26,491 --> 00:19:29,190
affect testosterone or growth hormone or
inflammation.

439
00:19:29,191 --> 00:19:32,250
Generally.
It's like a 24 to 48 hour cycle.

440
00:19:32,251 --> 00:19:33,084
You know,
it's like weed,

441
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:35,100
you know,
we know that we'd suppresses

442
00:19:35,101 --> 00:19:37,020
testosterone,
but it's not chronic.

443
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:39,090
It's a,
it's a temporary 24 hour drop in

444
00:19:39,091 --> 00:19:42,040
testosterone.
Does it really suppressed his task does

445
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:43,770
know about that.
Yeah.

446
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,890
Although a lot,
a lot of the studies on on marijuana,

447
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,520
they're using pretty high dosage and
they're using rodent models using like a

448
00:19:50,521 --> 00:19:53,230
hundred to 200 milligrams and road and
rushing.

449
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:56,250
Yeah,
and I'm sorry,

450
00:19:56,490 --> 00:20:00,840
what would be the equivalent of a
hundred to 200 milligrams in a human on

451
00:20:00,841 --> 00:20:02,910
a rodent model?
You know a lot of,

452
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:06,990
a lot of the studies on supplementation,
same thing with Tbi and concussion.

453
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:10,290
You know you hear about Dha and fish oil
for that,

454
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:14,130
but you need to take a lot of fish oil.
A lot of Dha,

455
00:20:14,131 --> 00:20:16,110
like if you extrapolate from the rodent
models,

456
00:20:16,111 --> 00:20:21,111
you're looking at like 50 to 60 grams of
Dha or fish oil to manage like Tbi or

457
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:23,390
concussion,
which is,

458
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,760
it's a lot of Dha.
But if you were going to use like a

459
00:20:26,761 --> 00:20:31,380
multimodal approach to,
to Tbi or Alzheimer's or dementia,

460
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,780
I mean I'm a,
I'm a huge fan of that.

461
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:36,930
I'm a fan of,
of like hyperbaric oxygen therapy.

462
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:41,460
Um,
key ptosis definitely works that these,

463
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,210
these light devices that you wear on
your head now they've got a lot of

464
00:20:45,211 --> 00:20:50,110
research coming out on something called
photo biomodulation for Tbi and these

465
00:20:50,111 --> 00:20:55,111
things produce a hertz frequencies,
10 to 40 hertz range.

466
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:58,660
You place them on your head.
Typically there's like a probe that goes

467
00:20:58,661 --> 00:21:02,410
into your nose and they've got new
research coming out on this for

468
00:21:02,411 --> 00:21:06,160
restoring blood flow to the head,
increasing your Alpha brainwave

469
00:21:06,161 --> 00:21:08,230
production or gamma grip brainwave
production.

470
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:10,810
Very cool devices.
Um,

471
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:14,170
so what does,
what does the probe up your nose do it,

472
00:21:14,171 --> 00:21:19,171
it delivers a wavelength of light that
is supposed to activate.

473
00:21:19,571 --> 00:21:23,890
Part of the Mitochondria is called
cytochrome c oxidase and when you

474
00:21:23,891 --> 00:21:26,620
activate that you get increased
mitochondrial activity,

475
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:29,710
you get increased blood flow,
you get increased production of nitric

476
00:21:29,711 --> 00:21:31,870
oxide.
And this kind of returns to what I was

477
00:21:31,871 --> 00:21:35,500
talking about with seasonal affective
disorder where you can use a lot of a

478
00:21:35,501 --> 00:21:38,860
lot of these new things that are
designed to deliver infrared light or

479
00:21:38,861 --> 00:21:42,710
light to the body to increase
mitochondrial density or to increase

480
00:21:42,711 --> 00:21:47,080
blood flow or increased nitric oxide and
people are not using this for Tbi and

481
00:21:47,081 --> 00:21:50,560
concussion and then stem cells as well.
They've got a,

482
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:53,890
actually last time I was on the show,
we were talking about how when I got

483
00:21:53,891 --> 00:21:58,090
that concussion in Austin,
I did a self administered fusion of

484
00:21:58,091 --> 00:21:58,840
sugar alcohols.

485
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:02,170
I used man a tall and then I followed
that up with stem cells because at my

486
00:22:02,171 --> 00:22:06,430
stem cells stored down in Florida and
also in this lab called forever labs in

487
00:22:06,431 --> 00:22:08,200
Berkeley.
And I followed that up.

488
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:12,400
I chased it with a stem cell injection
because when you inject sugar alcohol

489
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:15,400
into your bloodstream,
it renders your blood brain barrier more

490
00:22:15,401 --> 00:22:18,370
permeable and then the stem cells can
crossover through the blood brain

491
00:22:18,371 --> 00:22:20,560
barrier.
But now hold on,

492
00:22:20,561 --> 00:22:24,550
slow down.
So this show your how you,

493
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:26,230
what are you doing with the sugar
alcohol,

494
00:22:26,231 --> 00:22:30,400
how you're administering it
intravenously and intravenous mannitol

495
00:22:30,401 --> 00:22:31,900
solution.
You're doing this yourself.

496
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:34,150
I do this myself,
but you could get this done by a doctor

497
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:36,310
and when you're doing it elaborate,
I recommend you get it done.

498
00:22:36,311 --> 00:22:38,490
But it sounds like a good idea to do now
what,

499
00:22:38,491 --> 00:22:40,840
what kind of dosages are using of
Mannitol?

500
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:42,190
Yeah,
I don't remember what it was.

501
00:22:42,191 --> 00:22:44,470
It was what I was advised to do by the
doc who,

502
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:47,380
who taught me this protocol,
remember how much it was.

503
00:22:47,381 --> 00:22:50,350
But it was
like a vile.

504
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,220
Yeah,
I do.

505
00:22:51,221 --> 00:22:55,060
I do the same thing with naed every week
I do a weekly Nad injection.

506
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:56,340
Everyone had said,
yeah,

507
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:59,500
push any,
say it takes you 10 minutes with Shy v

508
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:02,120
10 minutes is pushing it.
Um,

509
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:03,123
it hurt.
I mean,

510
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:06,820
so normally if you were to get 500 to a
thousand milligrams of Nad,

511
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:11,320
most people will sit under a four to a
six hour drip ivy to do that.

512
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:14,500
And one reason for that,
that,

513
00:23:14,501 --> 00:23:18,820
that they say is that you get less of a
degraded by the liver and the kidneys

514
00:23:18,821 --> 00:23:21,590
and the gut as [inaudible] goes into the
body then it put.

515
00:23:21,591 --> 00:23:22,690
But I think,
uh,

516
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:26,590
I think that the bigger factor is simply
the fact that when you do a push,

517
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:29,890
like you're nauseous,
you feel like your whole body's on fire.

518
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:31,960
I mean if you feel like superman
afterwards,

519
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:36,460
but it's a very,
very uncomfortable ivy and I don't want

520
00:23:36,461 --> 00:23:38,800
anybody pushing that and accept me.
Like I want to be in charge of the

521
00:23:38,801 --> 00:23:41,830
trigger when I'm putting that thing in
because I got to stop and go and stop

522
00:23:41,831 --> 00:23:43,060
and go.
But it's,

523
00:23:43,061 --> 00:23:44,230
it's,
it's quicker.

524
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:46,510
It's more convenient than sitting down
and doing an ISV.

525
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,610
So a push,
you would actually have a nurse actually

526
00:23:49,611 --> 00:23:52,100
pushing down on the button as things are
going.

527
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:53,570
Yeah,
exactly.

528
00:23:53,571 --> 00:23:56,570
And it didn't intermittent intervals.
Uh,

529
00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:01,750
I do about two like two ticks on the
syringe at a time cause it's a 30 ml

530
00:24:02,301 --> 00:24:05,150
syringe.
So I'll go like two CC's then stop.

531
00:24:05,151 --> 00:24:08,510
And you could feel like your heart rate
go up and you get nauseous and your skin

532
00:24:08,511 --> 00:24:11,030
kind of flushes a little bit and you
breathe it off.

533
00:24:11,031 --> 00:24:13,940
Then you wait like 10 15 seconds and you
do another push.

534
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:16,730
Kyle Kingsbury was saying it felt like
his guts were on fire.

535
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,950
Yeah,
caught kyle I think is a champ.

536
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:21,790
I think he did it in like five minutes
or something,

537
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:25,430
but it sounds like for me,
if I,

538
00:24:25,431 --> 00:24:30,431
if I can do it in 10 minutes then it's,
it's absolutely mind blowing in terms of

539
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:34,910
how hard that is.
I don't know how he did it in five

540
00:24:34,911 --> 00:24:35,530
minutes,
but,

541
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:37,340
well he's a savage.
You know it's interesting.

542
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:41,090
I started to listen to your podcast with
David Sinclair on the,

543
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,850
on the car ride over and he's talking
about this nmn stuff,

544
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:48,530
which supposedly when orally
administered simulates a lot of what an

545
00:24:48,531 --> 00:24:50,390
ar,
nicotinamide riboside,

546
00:24:50,391 --> 00:24:54,590
which is one thing that a lot of people
are taking for anti aging and in a d,

547
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:55,940
which is what we were just talking
about,

548
00:24:55,941 --> 00:24:59,120
administered via either,
in most cases it's ivy,

549
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:02,210
there's a couple companies doing like an
oral and a d version,

550
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:03,590
but supposedly,
man,

551
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:05,510
an mn,
uh,

552
00:25:05,511 --> 00:25:08,870
I don't know if sinclair has any human
studies coming out on this right now,

553
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:11,210
but he or,
or at least released,

554
00:25:11,211 --> 00:25:14,780
but he's done in the studies and show
that it's like exercise in a bottle.

555
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,510
The Nad,
from what I understand though,

556
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:21,620
and this returns to the Tbi concussion
piece crosses the blood brain barrier

557
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:26,360
easily or more easily than nmn or nr.
So if you were doing it for like a

558
00:25:26,361 --> 00:25:29,970
cognitive or neurological effect,
you may want to choose Nad.

559
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,940
It sounds to me like from the research
I've seen,

560
00:25:31,941 --> 00:25:33,710
if you were doing it for the exercise
effect,

561
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:38,630
maybe you choose nmn or nr.
Interesting being anti aging effect.

562
00:25:38,631 --> 00:25:43,631
I mean they don't even know in many
cases ha all the pathways on which these

563
00:25:43,911 --> 00:25:46,670
things are working.
But most of them are related to these

564
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:50,570
sirtuin pathways where it likes or two
inactivating compounds that actually

565
00:25:50,571 --> 00:25:53,540
allow your mitochondria to repair more
quickly or give your body more

566
00:25:53,541 --> 00:25:57,170
antioxidants.
So the idea is they probably all have a

567
00:25:57,171 --> 00:26:00,140
pretty good effect on anti aging.
And when you're doing it,

568
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:01,640
are you pushing yourself?

569
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:04,010
You said you're doing it once a week or
you did it yourself,

570
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,230
but you pushing it.
Yeah.

571
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,730
Yeah.
And how much time do you give yourself

572
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,680
to actually do the nmd?
Yeah,

573
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:11,990
if I've got 20 minutes,
I'm happy.

574
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:16,940
If I have to compress in a 10 minutes it
at hearts like I like to at least allow

575
00:26:16,941 --> 00:26:18,440
for 20 minutes.
And then,

576
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:21,260
uh,
you follow it up in most cases with like

577
00:26:21,261 --> 00:26:23,060
an ivy cocktail,
like a,

578
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:27,920
like a myers cocktail vitamin cocktail
and supposedly supposedly that it does a

579
00:26:27,921 --> 00:26:31,070
few things.
Supposedly it enhances your stem cell

580
00:26:31,071 --> 00:26:34,910
mobilization or the or the activity of
stem cells and allows the n d to be

581
00:26:34,911 --> 00:26:38,120
absorbed into the cells more easily.
So you basically,

582
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:42,230
I mean the way I do it is I use it like
it just a butterfly needle and you do

583
00:26:42,231 --> 00:26:44,870
the Nad administration and then you just
unscrew the,

584
00:26:44,871 --> 00:26:47,640
the end of the,
the butterfly needle line.

585
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,640
And then you put the vitamin cocktail
and follow up with vitamin cocktail,

586
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:53,220
which takes like 30 to 60 seconds and
then you're done.

587
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:56,460
And why do you do it once a week?
Did you feel good?

588
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:57,261
No.
But why,

589
00:26:57,261 --> 00:26:59,040
why once a week?
Why not twice a week?

590
00:26:59,041 --> 00:27:00,120
Why?
The idea is you're,

591
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:03,040
you're supposed to maintain your levels
and there's even some evidence and,

592
00:27:03,041 --> 00:27:03,751
and it,
you know,

593
00:27:03,751 --> 00:27:06,780
this is kind of similar to testosterone,
that longterm use may suppress your

594
00:27:06,781 --> 00:27:09,930
body's on nad production.
So we're going to start to do it.

595
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:12,960
Great.
But you may want to realize that this is

596
00:27:12,961 --> 00:27:16,410
something you'd need to do regularly and
like to keep your levels elevated

597
00:27:16,411 --> 00:27:18,840
because you may get like a
downregulation of fact.

598
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:19,771
Oh,
interesting.

599
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:22,980
So your body might recognize that it
hasn't up a surplus.

600
00:27:22,981 --> 00:27:25,260
It's got a lot of Nad.
It doesn't need to make more.

601
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,393
One of the,
uh,

602
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:30,000
one of the very interesting things
though I did a couple of weeks ago was I

603
00:27:30,001 --> 00:27:33,750
went to New York City and I got Nad from
this doctor,

604
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:38,850
a Dr. Chen over there.
But then he infused me with a co q 10

605
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:43,980
and a bunch of other vitamins to allow
my body to make more of what are called

606
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,760
adult pluripotent stem cells.
They're also known as the t cells,

607
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:52,790
very small embryonic like cells.
Now if you've heard of a pair of biosis

608
00:27:53,461 --> 00:27:58,461
before this idea of taking the blood
from young mice and transferring that

609
00:27:59,041 --> 00:28:00,720
into old mines,
there was research that they did at

610
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:05,640
Stanford University on this.
You impart essentially enhance longevity

611
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,430
to the old mice.
The idea is that's a,

612
00:28:08,431 --> 00:28:10,570
that's a non autologous transfer or I
like that.

613
00:28:10,571 --> 00:28:14,820
So that's the transfer of blood from a,
from my young healthy donor into an

614
00:28:14,821 --> 00:28:17,190
older recipient.
And there are companies now in silicon

615
00:28:17,191 --> 00:28:19,440
valley doing this,
like the young blood institute,

616
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:22,080
you know,
for like $8,000 this company called

617
00:28:22,081 --> 00:28:22,740
Ambrosia.

618
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,840
We'll,
we'll give you the plasma from a young

619
00:28:24,841 --> 00:28:27,030
healthy donor.
Is there any evidence that that does

620
00:28:27,031 --> 00:28:29,590
anything good for you though,
other than the studies that they've done

621
00:28:29,591 --> 00:28:30,630
in mice?
Uh,

622
00:28:30,631 --> 00:28:32,700
I don't know of any studies on humans.
Yeah,

623
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,040
no,
it was their anecdotal evidence.

624
00:28:35,041 --> 00:28:35,960
I mean,
if people that,

625
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:37,670
you know,
yeah,

626
00:28:37,671 --> 00:28:38,500
I'm,
I'm about to,

627
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:41,190
to get into that.
But you haven't,

628
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,340
no,
I did an autologous version of that,

629
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:46,650
so I didn't want to put somebody else's
blood so he didn't run body.

630
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:49,380
So what I did was I had this doc take
out a pint in my blood.

631
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:53,250
And what happens is if you've put all
these vitamins like Nad and stuff into

632
00:28:53,251 --> 00:28:55,860
your blood,
it increases your stem cell production.

633
00:28:56,310 --> 00:29:00,480
If you stress the blood after that,
it dumps out a bunch of these tiny

634
00:29:00,481 --> 00:29:04,920
little adult pluripotent stem cells,
which is exactly the same type of cell

635
00:29:04,921 --> 00:29:07,920
that you're getting when you do one of
these young blood transfers.

636
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:12,090
So he stresses that overnight in cold
you can use cold,

637
00:29:12,091 --> 00:29:13,680
you could use pressure,
you could use anything to,

638
00:29:13,681 --> 00:29:16,500
to increase the stem cell release from
the blood cells,

639
00:29:16,501 --> 00:29:19,710
but they get stressed out.
They released stem cells and then what

640
00:29:19,711 --> 00:29:22,890
happens is you get them injected back
into your body.

641
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,680
So this is similar to like what they're
doing with Regena cane.

642
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,800
I don't think it's anything like that,
but you know Janky and they take the

643
00:29:28,801 --> 00:29:31,830
blood out and they stress it with hia
and then they spin it in a centered

644
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,480
view.
But I think,

645
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:36,990
I think,
and I don't know a lot about what regena

646
00:29:36,991 --> 00:29:39,260
keen is doing,
but I think they're more concentrating

647
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:42,760
the growth factors.
I think they might be doing exosomes.

648
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:46,570
I know they've got some overseas places
where they're doing like a culture

649
00:29:46,571 --> 00:29:51,100
expanded or something like that.
But as far as in the u s like this,

650
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:54,640
this protocol is one of the few that I
know of where you could take your own

651
00:29:54,641 --> 00:29:59,140
blood and get a lot of that same stuff
that you'd get from culture expanded or

652
00:29:59,141 --> 00:30:01,900
from para biosis,
like using the blood of somebody else

653
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:04,360
and you get all these stem cells
released into your body.

654
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:08,520
So you essentially get the same effect
as you would if you took young person

655
00:30:08,521 --> 00:30:11,320
who if he did a young blood transfer and
the young blood transfer,

656
00:30:11,321 --> 00:30:15,140
then not transferring the entire bodies
supply of blow their third month,

657
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:17,140
they're taking the,
taking a bunch of plasma,

658
00:30:17,141 --> 00:30:18,700
I dunno,
the volume that they're using.

659
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:21,340
In my case they took a pint of my blood.
So four,

660
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:25,630
four 60 cc tubes.
Now is there any anecdotal evidence or

661
00:30:25,631 --> 00:30:29,770
any published evidence on your style,
the what you're trying to do and the

662
00:30:29,771 --> 00:30:31,150
benefits of it?
No.

663
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,310
Ms. Dot equals one.
I just felt like 1 million bucks

664
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,720
afterwards.
The,

665
00:30:34,721 --> 00:30:36,990
um,
the other one that I did that worked for

666
00:30:36,991 --> 00:30:37,870
a while,
my knee,

667
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:41,980
because I have some meniscus issues on
my left knee was I did what's called a

668
00:30:41,981 --> 00:30:44,410
nerve hydrodissection.
Have you heard of this before?

669
00:30:44,411 --> 00:30:47,590
I'll,
hydro dissection is a protocol where

670
00:30:47,591 --> 00:30:51,610
they take a,
like a liquid and they used the liquid

671
00:30:51,611 --> 00:30:56,611
to act like the scalp or the knife that
a surgeon would use to kind of remove

672
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:02,260
adhesions like scar tissue adhesions or
separate a nerve that's causing pain or

673
00:31:02,261 --> 00:31:05,590
discomfort or lack of mobility in a
certain joint.

674
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:09,640
But when they do a nerve hydrodissection
they don't have to use like,

675
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,530
you know,
something like they'd use in

676
00:31:11,531 --> 00:31:15,520
prolotherapy like sugar water or regular
water.

677
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:17,440
Uh,
what I had done,

678
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:21,430
and this was at a clinic called bio
reset in uh,

679
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:24,010
in San Jose with Doctor Matt Cook down
there.

680
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:29,490
He went in and did a nerve
hydrodissection and he used ozone and a,

681
00:31:30,781 --> 00:31:33,520
a placental cell.
And it wasn't like a culture expanded

682
00:31:33,521 --> 00:31:36,160
placental cell,
which is what I understand to be illegal

683
00:31:36,161 --> 00:31:39,040
in the u s but just like a regular
placental extract.

684
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:44,250
He did that into my knee and my knee
went from like 25% to 100% in a couple

685
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,320
of weeks.
And that that protocol was called nerve

686
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:50,700
hydrodissection.
They use ultrasound imaging to,

687
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:53,650
to basically visualize where the needle
is going into the knee.

688
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:57,040
They identify the area where the
adhesion or the scar tissue is.

689
00:31:57,250 --> 00:32:00,460
They inject it right there and then the,
I mean it's like a 10 minute long

690
00:32:00,461 --> 00:32:01,294
procedure.

691
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:05,590
Now this is for only a buildup of
adhesions and scar tissue.

692
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:06,900
What about for people that,
you know Mike,

693
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:09,490
it was coping.
Yeah,

694
00:32:09,491 --> 00:32:14,170
it was developed for nerve pain and what
they found was that it actually seems to

695
00:32:14,171 --> 00:32:18,160
cause some kind of a release of the scar
tissue followed by an increase in the

696
00:32:18,161 --> 00:32:20,590
blood flow,
which is difficult to get in some areas

697
00:32:20,591 --> 00:32:23,170
of the knee especially.
So yeah,

698
00:32:23,171 --> 00:32:26,770
I mean I will,
if I ever get to the point where

699
00:32:26,771 --> 00:32:28,930
somebody wants to sculpt my knee or
something like that,

700
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,360
I would,
I would definitely consider doing that

701
00:32:31,361 --> 00:32:35,020
dream of first cause they worked very
well and it was just quick and easy.

702
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:38,830
I had a meniscus issue and I got
exosomes shot into that.

703
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:40,070
I've had it done three times

704
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:45,070
now and every time I've done it I've
experienced a good benefit from it.

705
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,550
But then I beat the shit out of it and I
think I gave it not enough time to heal

706
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:52,850
up before I started pounding again.
I would give it like a week off,

707
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:56,120
then start running again.
But now I'm going to give it a full six

708
00:32:56,121 --> 00:32:59,210
weeks with a no pounding,
no running hills,

709
00:32:59,211 --> 00:33:02,060
nothing crazy.
And I've experienced just in the two

710
00:33:02,061 --> 00:33:06,680
weeks since the procedure,
a very significant decrease in pain,

711
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:08,740
no inflammation,
decreasing.

712
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:12,050
Discovered.
I have to like try to make it feel weird

713
00:33:12,051 --> 00:33:16,040
now I have to like go out of my way and
it seems like every week that's more and

714
00:33:16,041 --> 00:33:18,830
more difficult to do and range of
motions increased.

715
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:21,890
Uh,
basically it can go all the way down

716
00:33:21,891 --> 00:33:24,830
with my ass to my ankles,
no problem,

717
00:33:24,831 --> 00:33:26,510
you know,
and bend all the way down and back all

718
00:33:26,511 --> 00:33:28,760
the way up with no discomfort,
no weirdness.

719
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:31,700
Yeah,
I kind of question the one thing,

720
00:33:31,701 --> 00:33:33,980
cause I've asked myself this before and
I don't know if you have,

721
00:33:33,981 --> 00:33:38,630
like when you get a protocol like that
done any kind of go easy on your knee

722
00:33:38,631 --> 00:33:41,330
because you really want it to work and
you start backing off as some of that

723
00:33:41,331 --> 00:33:44,180
stuff you were doing anyways.
How much of it is you just backing off

724
00:33:44,181 --> 00:33:48,210
of what you were doing and how much of
it is the exosomes and the south cells?

725
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:51,860
I know because I did try to back off
initially and it didn't have any

726
00:33:51,861 --> 00:33:53,310
incident compared.
Yeah.

727
00:33:53,311 --> 00:33:55,430
When I,
when I backed off initially with

728
00:33:55,431 --> 00:33:57,710
nothing,
I said let me just take some time off

729
00:33:57,711 --> 00:33:59,450
and let it see if I can let it heal up.
Didn't,

730
00:33:59,451 --> 00:34:00,410
it ain't shit.
It just,

731
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:04,190
it stayed exactly the same.
Like it was just hurt,

732
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:05,121
you know,
like,

733
00:34:05,121 --> 00:34:09,140
so it was one of those things where in
the past I would have had to just deal

734
00:34:09,141 --> 00:34:09,830
with it.

735
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:13,010
Now this is my new world,
this is my new feeling and my knee until

736
00:34:13,011 --> 00:34:14,150
I get it scoped.
Yeah.

737
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,050
So it's pretty significant.
The impact that it's had.

738
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,660
I mean,
I'm a giant believer in stem cells and

739
00:34:20,661 --> 00:34:23,200
exosomes.
I had a full length rotator cuff tear in

740
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:26,390
my right shoulder and now it's gone.
It's gone.

741
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:29,660
Like it doesn't exist anymore.
And Doctor Rodney Mcgee out a vegas

742
00:34:29,661 --> 00:34:30,361
coat.
You know what?

743
00:34:30,361 --> 00:34:31,980
He looked at the,
uh,

744
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:33,950
the MRI and he said to me,
he goes,

745
00:34:33,951 --> 00:34:37,730
do you know how fucking crazy that is?
Like you had a tear and your rotator

746
00:34:37,731 --> 00:34:41,840
cuff and now there is no tear.
Like it's regenerated tissue.

747
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,030
It's crazy.
She's the ultimate goal,

748
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:44,631
right?
I mean,

749
00:34:44,631 --> 00:34:47,180
now I have zero pain in this shoulder.
I mean,

750
00:34:47,181 --> 00:34:48,650
nothing did you do,
I was like,

751
00:34:48,651 --> 00:34:51,350
did you not have belong?
I did peptides.

752
00:34:51,351 --> 00:34:53,150
I did a,
what does it bpc one,

753
00:34:53,151 --> 00:34:53,870
five,
seven.

754
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:55,790
Yeah,
that will be the pc one five,

755
00:34:55,791 --> 00:34:57,920
seven.
That's the only one that's,

756
00:34:58,090 --> 00:35:02,750
that's still legal according to Usada
and Wada for athletes to use.

757
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:07,280
And that one decreases inflammation and
increases blood flow.

758
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:10,410
And then the other one,
the one that that's not allowed anymore

759
00:35:10,411 --> 00:35:13,640
as tb 500 times and Beta 500 and not one
repairs.

760
00:35:13,641 --> 00:35:17,210
The Actin and myocin fibers.
And so in a,

761
00:35:17,211 --> 00:35:20,080
in a gold standard protocol,
you go back and forth between the two.

762
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:25,250
When you switch it up one one day,
like inject subcutaneously near the site

763
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:28,640
of injury now works for a lot of people.
The peptides are weird.

764
00:35:28,641 --> 00:35:30,980
Like I'm,
I'm attending all these anti aging and

765
00:35:30,981 --> 00:35:33,650
longevity conferences now cause I want
to learn a lot more about this.

766
00:35:33,651 --> 00:35:36,680
I'm almost Kinda,
I'm kinda starting to pivot from just

767
00:35:36,681 --> 00:35:38,070
pure human performance to how

768
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:40,920
can you,
how can you live a long time and talk to

769
00:35:40,921 --> 00:35:42,060
sinclair.
Yeah,

770
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:44,310
yeah.
Well I want to finish listening to your

771
00:35:44,311 --> 00:35:46,650
interview with him cause I was intrigued
by have an older guy.

772
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:47,970
Yeah.
So the,

773
00:35:47,971 --> 00:35:51,120
um,
the idea is that these peptides are

774
00:35:51,121 --> 00:35:54,180
talked about a lot now in these anti
aging circles.

775
00:35:54,181 --> 00:35:56,460
Like they,
they've got weird names like,

776
00:35:56,490 --> 00:36:01,050
like epic Taylon is one and two times a
year,

777
00:36:01,051 --> 00:36:04,680
like a 10 to 20 day injection protocol
of epic Taylon.

778
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:08,550
They're getting a bunch of increased
mitochondrial density,

779
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:11,160
decrease markers of aging,
uh,

780
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:13,680
increased fat loss,
increased muscle gain.

781
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:16,200
And they've done that in humans.
And so again,

782
00:36:16,201 --> 00:36:17,730
it's just a peptide.
It's very easy.

783
00:36:17,731 --> 00:36:19,320
Like you,
you would inject it next to your

784
00:36:19,321 --> 00:36:22,290
abdominals subcutaneously.
There's another one.

785
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:24,210
No side effects.
This one,

786
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,710
uh,
not with that one,

787
00:36:25,711 --> 00:36:28,290
but this one called Melanotan.
Have you heard of it before?

788
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:29,880
No.
So I was intrigued by this.

789
00:36:29,881 --> 00:36:31,640
Somebody was telling me about it.
It's a,

790
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:36,880
it's a peptide and it was used in the
bodybuilding industry for a long time

791
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:39,810
because when you inject it,
it gives you,

792
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:42,660
uh,
like this amazing Tan and they call it

793
00:36:42,661 --> 00:36:45,780
Malano.
Tanis stimulates your Melanin lady that

794
00:36:45,781 --> 00:36:48,810
was on that fucking show that was
turning black.

795
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:50,370
She believed that she was,
yeah.

796
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,430
Then the wrong skin.
So she was shooting something into her

797
00:36:53,431 --> 00:36:55,950
body and she got black,
like Congo black.

798
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,180
Well,
I,

799
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:59,940
I tried it out.
I tried it out for about a week.

800
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:01,680
You try to get black?
No,

801
00:37:01,681 --> 00:37:03,100
I didn't try to get black.
I just want it.

802
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:04,540
Just wanted to see what happened to the
Tan.

803
00:37:04,541 --> 00:37:08,880
And I started to get some freckles.
But the side effect of this is you get

804
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:12,900
massive boners that lasts a really
annoyingly long time.

805
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,720
So you were like,
you can't say no,

806
00:37:15,721 --> 00:37:17,890
but people will use this is like almost
light,

807
00:37:17,891 --> 00:37:21,060
like an ed type of drug,
but it,

808
00:37:21,061 --> 00:37:23,010
and I don't even know the mechanism of
action.

809
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,940
Like I don't know how it's even working.
Well,

810
00:37:24,941 --> 00:37:26,640
it's giving you a black,
so basically you get it.

811
00:37:26,641 --> 00:37:28,080
Yeah.
You get a Tan and boners.

812
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:28,490
Yeah,
this is all,

813
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:31,800
yeah.
I don't know.

814
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:33,490
That's not how you would administer
Malana.

815
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:35,950
She's,
she's doing some kind of like a volume.

816
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:39,420
What is that thing that she's doing with
the syringe?

817
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:41,490
What?
That looks like a caulking gun.

818
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,050
Like what is she doing?
Picture,

819
00:37:43,051 --> 00:37:43,711
I don't know.
Yeah,

820
00:37:43,711 --> 00:37:46,740
that bitch isn't as a type of thing like
the Kardashians are doing to their ass

821
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:48,930
cheeks,
like fillers.

822
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:52,620
I don't know what they're doing.
They're doing something that seems like,

823
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:54,960
well,
it's very popular with the young people

824
00:37:54,961 --> 00:37:55,794
these days.

825
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,220
They're taking fat out of certain parts
of their body and putting it in their

826
00:37:59,221 --> 00:38:00,330
ass.
Right.

827
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,640
It's not,
I don't,

828
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:04,260
let's,
we should find out.

829
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:08,850
That's how I see getting diaper,
but just google are women today.

830
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,420
How are instagram models getting diaper?
But I'm curious because that's what it

831
00:38:12,421 --> 00:38:13,680
is.
It's what you're using their own.

832
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,080
Taking their fat from somewhere else on
their body.

833
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:17,290
Yes.
Injecting.

834
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:21,120
I know that some people do that.
We should do that for our calves.

835
00:38:21,121 --> 00:38:23,040
That way we could start an instagram
calf channel.

836
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,520
No,
I don't want fat calves where the

837
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:28,860
Jiggling and walk like a girl's butt
while he's pulling that up.

838
00:38:28,861 --> 00:38:30,450
What kind of coffee is this?
Uh,

839
00:38:30,451 --> 00:38:32,310
this is black rifle coffee.
It's good.

840
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:33,360
Yeah,
it's good stuff.

841
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:34,223
Yeah.
I,

842
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,900
I figured out something.
Uh,

843
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:39,160
thank you by the way,
for hooking me up with trigger.

844
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:41,770
Oh Great.
Let's try your timber lines.

845
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:46,540
Those are the Shit I've been making a
coffee rub for the coffee rubbed before.

846
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:47,620
Yes,
I have trigger.

847
00:38:47,621 --> 00:38:48,860
Has their own coffee rub you?
Well,

848
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,520
they have their own,
I love you trigger,

849
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:55,480
but I sometimes never know what all is
in some of these spices and rubs.

850
00:38:55,481 --> 00:38:58,090
You know the lab sometimes Maltodextrin,
sugar and stuff.

851
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:00,370
There's some sugar in there.
So I find grind,

852
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:03,510
I find grind coffee and I mixed that
with Black Kona,

853
00:39:03,511 --> 00:39:05,530
salt,
Cayenne pepper and Paprika.

854
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:08,940
And you can just make that rub his stick
as you want.

855
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:13,120
Put that on the Ribeye.
And I've almost switched completely from

856
00:39:13,121 --> 00:39:17,320
doing my,
my stove top sear followed by the quick

857
00:39:17,321 --> 00:39:21,670
broil on either side to doing like a one
and a half to two hours smoke in the

858
00:39:21,671 --> 00:39:25,540
trigger with that coffee rub on and
they're just finishing it on the grill

859
00:39:25,541 --> 00:39:26,374
with the tracker.

860
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:28,540
Yeah,
I did a uh,

861
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:29,493
uh,
uh,

862
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,480
what,
what would you call it?

863
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:33,580
A prime rib,
you know,

864
00:39:33,581 --> 00:39:35,920
like,
so instead it's basically ribeye roast

865
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:40,630
and I did one on the trigger and I
cooked it for like four hours at 220

866
00:39:40,631 --> 00:39:42,880
degrees.
Holy Shit.

867
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,760
You smoked it for hours?
Yes,

868
00:39:45,761 --> 00:39:47,170
yes.
And that it had,

869
00:39:47,171 --> 00:39:51,340
I use the traders
smoke at that temperature.

870
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,670
This is a super smoke setting at two 25
and below.

871
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,070
Okay.
Press the super smoke button and it

872
00:39:57,071 --> 00:39:59,690
constantly infuses this pump of smoke
like,

873
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:01,330
like it's like,
Whoa,

874
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:04,140
I've never tried super smoke at that
high of a temperature.

875
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:09,450
Good loans or US delicious dude and the
but the trager prime rib rub.

876
00:40:09,611 --> 00:40:12,040
I know it has sugar in it.
It's tastes too delicious to not,

877
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:14,470
but holy shit when it's in there for
three and a half,

878
00:40:14,471 --> 00:40:16,510
four hours and it has that crossed on
it.

879
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:19,720
There's some words some about that long
smoke.

880
00:40:19,721 --> 00:40:23,620
Have you tried to beer?
Can chicken beer can chicken?

881
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:25,600
So I've,
I've tried a bunch of different rubs on

882
00:40:25,601 --> 00:40:27,910
that but just,
just core salt and black pepper works

883
00:40:27,911 --> 00:40:31,620
fine for the beer can chicken you empty
about half of the beer can out.

884
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:35,230
You open up the beer can but then you
poke a couple extra holes in the top so

885
00:40:35,231 --> 00:40:38,590
you get more of the steam so they inside
of the chicken gets even more moist.

886
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:41,920
But then when I figured out is if you
use like a little little scalpel or

887
00:40:41,921 --> 00:40:45,430
exacto knife and you cut open the skin
of the chicken around the outside a

888
00:40:45,431 --> 00:40:49,730
little bit and you stuff that with pads
of butter and then you do your smoke

889
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:54,370
pads of butter and said the chicken that
the skin gets crispy,

890
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:57,550
super crispy and so you just,
it's like,

891
00:40:57,610 --> 00:40:59,350
I think it's like an hour,
an hour and a half.

892
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:02,770
He Cook that one and he can't,
you can't smoke that one very

893
00:41:02,771 --> 00:41:04,370
successfully.
Like you want to run the grill with a

894
00:41:04,371 --> 00:41:07,510
smoke on but you can't super smoke it
and didn't seem to work so well,

895
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:10,210
but that beer can chicken.
That's frickin amazing.

896
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:13,410
Whoever figured that out,
whatever drunk figured that out as a god

897
00:41:13,411 --> 00:41:16,180
damn genius.
It works.

898
00:41:16,181 --> 00:41:19,750
But I've wondered before if there are
other things that will work even better

899
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,730
than beer.
We've got Jamie,

900
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:26,760
it says in most cases what I'm finding
is either Brazilian butt lift or just

901
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:31,450
like a fat graft or fat injection.
But there have been cases where I'm

902
00:41:31,451 --> 00:41:34,490
seeing that they had to get an injection
taken out within weeks because it was

903
00:41:34,491 --> 00:41:36,710
causing a problem.
So like I don't know if that was just

904
00:41:36,711 --> 00:41:38,630
fat.
Do you got the fat put in then you have

905
00:41:38,631 --> 00:41:39,530
to get it,
take it back out.

906
00:41:39,531 --> 00:41:40,364
Yeah.
Cause they were to,

907
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,530
they were dying the bar.
Great.

908
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,830
And then you have this fucking war zone
of an hour.

909
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:48,730
Yeah.
Most of it is light leaves,

910
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:51,410
some bars.
Syrian few pocs.

911
00:41:51,490 --> 00:41:52,760
Airstrip.
Yeah.

912
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:53,571
Yeah.
No more.

913
00:41:53,571 --> 00:41:54,740
No more.
G string,

914
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:59,600
32 people died supposedly in 2017 from
wonderful.

915
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:00,110
Yeah.

916
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:01,490
Yeah.
That's like the same amount of people

917
00:42:01,491 --> 00:42:03,110
that died from coconuts fall on their
head.

918
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,830
That's a fucking ridiculous way to die.
You know?

919
00:42:06,831 --> 00:42:08,930
And here's the thing,
the,

920
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:13,370
what they're doing is not aesthetically
pleasing because it violates your

921
00:42:13,371 --> 00:42:16,580
sensibilities cause you look at the ass.
Then you look at the legs and you go,

922
00:42:16,581 --> 00:42:19,520
what's wrong here?
How did you get that ass with those

923
00:42:19,521 --> 00:42:21,140
legs?
They don't go together.

924
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:25,000
Like if you look at like a crossfitters
legs,

925
00:42:25,001 --> 00:42:28,940
like one of them powerful gals with a
big butt,

926
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:30,860
but they also have to shoot with those
eyes.

927
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:33,020
The high neon compression socks.
Ooh,

928
00:42:33,021 --> 00:42:35,720
la La.
It looks right.

929
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:38,050
It fits.
Like if the assets,

930
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:40,670
it's the thigh,
it's not entirely disproportionate.

931
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:42,930
Yes.
When the ass pumps out and then it goes

932
00:42:42,931 --> 00:42:44,720
to a little toothpick legs,
you're like,

933
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:47,030
that's gross.
That's weird.

934
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:49,940
You know,
like it's comical.

935
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:52,720
That's a real ass.
Graham.

936
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:57,020
We may be evolving as a species to find
these type of things more attractive

937
00:42:57,021 --> 00:42:58,730
though,
because that's the whole idea was social

938
00:42:58,731 --> 00:43:02,540
media is you get a dopamine hit every
time you click on the little blue

939
00:43:02,541 --> 00:43:06,200
notification button or you look at a new
photo.

940
00:43:06,201 --> 00:43:09,710
So maybe we're just going to eventually
develop a real appreciation for that

941
00:43:09,711 --> 00:43:11,060
type of symmetry.
No,

942
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:12,470
we'll redefine.
All right.

943
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,830
Know what true human symmetry is
incorrect.

944
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:17,870
It doesn't look as good.
It just doesn't look as good.

945
00:43:17,871 --> 00:43:20,750
It's a,
it's a cheap fix your squats.

946
00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:22,460
Yeah.
Get your ass to the gym.

947
00:43:22,461 --> 00:43:26,250
Girls to sit down wefts run up hill.
Uh,

948
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,280
alright.
So squats and muscle building.

949
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,230
Uh,
did you see that Rhonda?

950
00:43:30,231 --> 00:43:35,231
Patrick tweeted that study about mice
and Mile Nuclei and how when they,

951
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:41,680
when they dope mice they actually,
they never actually lose the muscles.

952
00:43:43,401 --> 00:43:44,610
Mile Nuclei.
Yeah.

953
00:43:44,611 --> 00:43:47,900
It's like those don't actually ever
disappear even just when you dope but

954
00:43:47,901 --> 00:43:52,330
just when you lift period muscle milk
essentially we had already known bill

955
00:43:52,350 --> 00:43:53,420
down muscle memory.

956
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:56,090
Muscle memory is always been in sort of
an anecdotal idea.

957
00:43:56,540 --> 00:44:01,250
We'll muscle memory has been in many
cases just based on a motor unit

958
00:44:01,251 --> 00:44:04,700
recruitment like meaning like you know,
like my wife,

959
00:44:04,701 --> 00:44:07,820
she ran for University of Idaho and when
I go out running with her still,

960
00:44:07,821 --> 00:44:11,030
even though she doesn't train,
she's just got faster leg turnover,

961
00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:13,970
she's got better form.
Like her body just remembers that.

962
00:44:13,971 --> 00:44:15,320
The same thing with a swimmer,
right.

963
00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:17,060
I'll,
I'll do a triathlon.

964
00:44:17,061 --> 00:44:20,090
Somebody who swam in college but hasn't
swam in 10 years will kick my ass just

965
00:44:20,091 --> 00:44:22,910
because they have that muscle memory in
terms of which,

966
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:27,560
which motor units to recruit when.
But this latest one was basically the

967
00:44:27,561 --> 00:44:31,920
idea that you retain actual Myo Nuclei
in the muscle.

968
00:44:31,921 --> 00:44:36,480
Like they thought for a long time that
those just disappeared and went away

969
00:44:36,481 --> 00:44:39,510
once you detrained.
But it turns out that they're all still

970
00:44:39,511 --> 00:44:39,870
there.

971
00:44:39,870 --> 00:44:43,290
So as soon as you start training again,
you build muscle more quickly.

972
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:44,360
And furthermore,
and that,

973
00:44:44,361 --> 00:44:48,600
and this was kind of like the political
part of it is if you've done some kind

974
00:44:48,601 --> 00:44:49,081
of,
you know,

975
00:44:49,081 --> 00:44:52,710
illegal performance enhancing procedure
or steroids or adult or whatever,

976
00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:56,460
you actually would have a higher
concentration of micro nuclei or mio

977
00:44:56,461 --> 00:44:58,560
nuclei available.
And there,

978
00:44:58,561 --> 00:45:00,390
there was a study even leading up to
that,

979
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:03,510
and this was,
I think this was like 2013 like this was

980
00:45:03,511 --> 00:45:08,511
a while ago where they took mice and
they gave one group testosterone.

981
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:14,020
The other group didn't get it and then
they spent six months off testosterone.

982
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:15,960
I don't remember how long they were on
it,

983
00:45:15,961 --> 00:45:18,450
but they spent six months off it.
And then they took those mice and they

984
00:45:18,451 --> 00:45:21,720
trained them with the training protocol
and the mice that were on the

985
00:45:21,721 --> 00:45:23,880
testosterone.
But we're no longer on,

986
00:45:23,881 --> 00:45:28,881
it had a 30% increase in muscle mass
compared to the other mice that only had

987
00:45:29,341 --> 00:45:32,130
a 5% increase on it.
So once again,

988
00:45:32,131 --> 00:45:33,330
the,
and this was probably related to that,

989
00:45:33,331 --> 00:45:35,970
my nuclei thing that just came out in
this recent study,

990
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:39,000
so it turns out that a,
you should,

991
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:42,390
you should lift like when you're young
because you can build all these micro

992
00:45:42,391 --> 00:45:46,380
nuclei that just basically hang around
your body and then b,

993
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:51,860
when they like ban somebody from sport
for doping and then they come back and

994
00:45:52,021 --> 00:45:55,530
start to compete in that sport again,
they still have an advantage.

995
00:45:55,930 --> 00:45:58,060
Mm.
Well that that has huge implications for

996
00:45:58,061 --> 00:46:00,820
MMA is this,
that's the big debate right now.

997
00:46:00,821 --> 00:46:04,780
How long should someone get suspended
for and for how long,

998
00:46:04,870 --> 00:46:07,360
you know,
how long afterwards should they be

999
00:46:07,361 --> 00:46:09,020
considered enhanced?
Yeah.

1000
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,470
You know,
like they're giving people some pretty

1001
00:46:11,471 --> 00:46:14,290
significant suspensions now for
steroids,

1002
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:16,300
like two years.
But you know,

1003
00:46:16,301 --> 00:46:18,730
there's this Jon Jones case and I'm sure
you're aware of,

1004
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:19,950
do you wear this?
Yeah.

1005
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:23,620
Where he's testing positive for the
metabolite,

1006
00:46:23,770 --> 00:46:27,460
for the longterm metabolite,
for a very small dose.

1007
00:46:27,461 --> 00:46:30,400
He's never tested positive for short
term metabolite.

1008
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:32,350
Which testosterone?
No,

1009
00:46:32,351 --> 00:46:34,120
it's not testosterone.
It's um,

1010
00:46:34,330 --> 00:46:36,400
what is the stuff?
Terrana ball.

1011
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:39,850
Yeah.
And essentially it's a tainted

1012
00:46:39,851 --> 00:46:42,130
supplement and it's not,
it doesn't have any performance

1013
00:46:42,131 --> 00:46:44,090
enhancing benefit in terms of like the,
the,

1014
00:46:44,091 --> 00:46:47,170
the amount of the dosage that he's
tested positive for,

1015
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:50,170
but it's lingering in his system because
the protocols for,

1016
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:53,890
um,
the weather ability rather to detect

1017
00:46:53,950 --> 00:46:56,170
these metabolites has increased rapidly.

1018
00:46:56,450 --> 00:47:00,730
And over the last year it's just
unbelievably more sensitive to the point

1019
00:47:00,731 --> 00:47:01,331
where,
you know,

1020
00:47:01,331 --> 00:47:05,770
they're detecting these infants
reasonably small levels of these

1021
00:47:05,771 --> 00:47:07,840
metabolites.
And there's also seems to be some sort

1022
00:47:07,841 --> 00:47:11,440
of a pulsing effect when your body
releases these infant testimony,

1023
00:47:11,441 --> 00:47:15,190
small metabolites and then doesn't,
so you'll test negative and then the

1024
00:47:15,190 --> 00:47:18,340
next week you'll test positive,
but only for the longterm metabolite,

1025
00:47:18,341 --> 00:47:21,670
which is an indication that there's no
re administration of the performance

1026
00:47:21,671 --> 00:47:22,900
enhancing drug.
Yeah.

1027
00:47:22,930 --> 00:47:25,300
So it's real,
it's in everybody's mad.

1028
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:27,460
There's so many athletes that are mad
about it.

1029
00:47:27,850 --> 00:47:32,830
And from what you're saying and for this
study that Doctor Rhonda Patrick

1030
00:47:32,831 --> 00:47:33,820
highlighted,
it's,

1031
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:34,833
you know,
it's,

1032
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:38,440
it's especially for someone who's
willingly taken something

1033
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:42,840
dope are always a doper type of things.
There is that.

1034
00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:48,160
But see the John Jones situation is very
tricky because she's so good and he's so

1035
00:47:48,161 --> 00:47:50,950
dominant that people just assume that
he's been doing something his whole

1036
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:51,620
career.

1037
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:53,290
You know?
And when you catch them they're like,

1038
00:47:53,291 --> 00:47:55,210
Aha.
That's the reason why he's so good.

1039
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:57,700
And it may be,
but it also might be,

1040
00:47:57,701 --> 00:48:00,490
he's got phenomenal genetics.
He has two brothers.

1041
00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:03,790
He was just the,
the best of the guys who are taking

1042
00:48:03,791 --> 00:48:05,830
drugs.
That's a different situation because

1043
00:48:05,831 --> 00:48:09,220
that's a sport where at least in the
time period where he was competing,

1044
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:10,770
everyone was doing something.
Yeah,

1045
00:48:10,810 --> 00:48:14,380
100% they had to go meet.
All the UFC is like that.

1046
00:48:14,381 --> 00:48:16,300
It's not right that it's not,
it's not.

1047
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:18,280
It can't be.
They're too strict.

1048
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:20,740
The Usada is knocking on doors at six
o'clock in the morning,

1049
00:48:21,010 --> 00:48:23,020
pee in this cup,
and you,

1050
00:48:23,021 --> 00:48:26,980
you do hear about positive tests,
but the amount of positive Taz versus

1051
00:48:26,981 --> 00:48:31,510
the negative test is overwhelming way
more guys are not doing something.

1052
00:48:31,930 --> 00:48:34,690
It used to be the opposite.
It used to be in the nineties everyone

1053
00:48:34,691 --> 00:48:35,524
was doing something.

1054
00:48:36,190 --> 00:48:39,760
We were just talking about this on the
fight companion podcast that a big issue

1055
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:43,300
is grappling.
Grappling competitions are overrun with

1056
00:48:43,301 --> 00:48:46,630
steroid users because no one's testing
and these,

1057
00:48:46,631 --> 00:48:49,540
I mean it's the smell test is off the
fucking charts.

1058
00:48:49,541 --> 00:48:51,550
You're looking at these guys who just
ridiculous,

1059
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:54,190
just jacked,
low body fat,

1060
00:48:54,191 --> 00:48:57,730
super high muscle mass and their
training Jujitsu all the time too.

1061
00:48:58,090 --> 00:49:02,890
So you would think it would be very hard
for them to maintain muscle mass as well

1062
00:49:02,891 --> 00:49:06,820
as be able to train the way they're
training with technique and drills and

1063
00:49:06,821 --> 00:49:09,130
cardio and it's very difficult to
maintain muscle.

1064
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:11,770
Any,
any concurrent strength endurance

1065
00:49:11,771 --> 00:49:13,450
training scenario.
Very difficult,

1066
00:49:13,451 --> 00:49:17,710
very difficult.
So there's a real issue with some of

1067
00:49:17,711 --> 00:49:22,711
these guys competing this way and then
trying to transition into MMA now.

1068
00:49:23,381 --> 00:49:25,810
What,
what's the deal with marijuana in

1069
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:28,960
[inaudible] in mma?
Pretty much legal now.

1070
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:29,650
Um,
the,

1071
00:49:29,650 --> 00:49:31,990
they don't in season,
out of season.

1072
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:32,853
Yeah,
it's fine.

1073
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:35,720
They just,
they've lowered the um,

1074
00:49:36,370 --> 00:49:40,420
acceptable level or the they've raised
it rather like what you could have in

1075
00:49:40,421 --> 00:49:42,310
your bloodstream.
You basically just can't be high the day

1076
00:49:42,311 --> 00:49:43,730
of the fight.
Yeah.

1077
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:46,030
And that's another interesting one.
I mean that acts,

1078
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:49,620
especially thc acts on a lot of these
mtor pathways,

1079
00:49:49,630 --> 00:49:50,500
you know,
that's,

1080
00:49:50,501 --> 00:49:52,510
that's the same thing with a lot of
these anti aging compounds,

1081
00:49:52,511 --> 00:49:55,330
right?
Like wrap a myosin or met form and to a

1082
00:49:55,331 --> 00:49:59,050
lesser extent acts on that end tor
pathway and inhibited.

1083
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:00,101
Right.
But again,

1084
00:50:00,101 --> 00:50:01,900
it's,
it's short term was something like

1085
00:50:01,901 --> 00:50:05,050
marijuana and you also get this pain
killing effect.

1086
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:09,430
And there was,
I forget if this was a study or if it

1087
00:50:09,431 --> 00:50:11,500
was,
if it was like anecdotal,

1088
00:50:11,501 --> 00:50:14,410
but it's almost like a higher thrill
seeking effect.

1089
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:19,440
Like the endocannabinoid system when
stimulated shuts down some of your,

1090
00:50:20,490 --> 00:50:22,870
your,
your sense of fear when it comes to

1091
00:50:22,871 --> 00:50:24,430
experiencing a new adventure.

1092
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,080
Really.
And so you actually,

1093
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:30,680
you actually go adventure seeking more.
And when you look at like ultra runners,

1094
00:50:31,010 --> 00:50:33,680
um,
anybody who's competing in a,

1095
00:50:33,770 --> 00:50:37,690
a non,
a complex activity in which they might

1096
00:50:37,691 --> 00:50:40,790
have already developed the ability to be
able to be in the zone,

1097
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:42,620
right?
They've put in their 10,000 hours of

1098
00:50:42,621 --> 00:50:46,520
practice and they're able to just kind
of check out and go into automatic mode.

1099
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:50,810
When you combine that with the pain
quelling effects of something like,

1100
00:50:50,811 --> 00:50:51,680
uh,
you know,

1101
00:50:51,681 --> 00:50:56,330
in most cases like a thc cbd Combo is
what a lot of ultra runners are using.

1102
00:50:56,331 --> 00:50:59,780
I'm not sure what what they'd use in,
in mma right now,

1103
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:02,570
but ultimately you get a good effect.
But,

1104
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:05,990
but the loss of reaction time and the
loss of the ability to be able to

1105
00:51:05,991 --> 00:51:09,680
perform complex tasks,
which they proven like flight simulation

1106
00:51:09,681 --> 00:51:14,300
studies dictates that it's still not
that great of a drug if you are going to

1107
00:51:14,301 --> 00:51:15,320
be doing complex tasks.

1108
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:18,140
The question though,
when they're talking about reaction

1109
00:51:18,141 --> 00:51:20,350
studies done,
they talking about reactions,

1110
00:51:20,351 --> 00:51:24,770
studies for people that are acclimated
to taking marijuana or they talking

1111
00:51:24,771 --> 00:51:28,430
about it with people where they take a,
someone who's a sober person and they

1112
00:51:28,431 --> 00:51:32,420
introduced him to marijuana and there's
this overwhelming effect of it because

1113
00:51:32,421 --> 00:51:36,140
one of the things that happens to people
that aren't accustomed to thc is the

1114
00:51:36,141 --> 00:51:38,300
freak out effect where they're just
like,

1115
00:51:38,450 --> 00:51:40,220
they're not comfortable with the
experience.

1116
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:42,560
After a while,
the way it's described,

1117
00:51:42,561 --> 00:51:43,910
and again,
this is all anecdotal,

1118
00:51:43,911 --> 00:51:46,520
but by people that are accustomed to it,
they say,

1119
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:51,530
you just get good at being high and see
the reaction time thing.

1120
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:55,780
I don't buy because a lot of strikers,
a lot of uh,

1121
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:59,360
kickboxers they train what while they're
on marijuana,

1122
00:51:59,361 --> 00:52:02,930
it's very common.
A lot of leave it on reaction time was

1123
00:52:02,931 --> 00:52:06,110
done on pilots and there's a,
there's a few more blinky lights in a

1124
00:52:06,111 --> 00:52:07,720
cockpit than,
than a mat.

1125
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:10,160
So sure that my more going on.
Sure.

1126
00:52:10,161 --> 00:52:12,080
But that's the,
the question is,

1127
00:52:12,081 --> 00:52:16,100
are they experienced stoners or these
people that are freaking out and maybe

1128
00:52:16,101 --> 00:52:18,770
the reaction time is they're spacing out
and they don't know what the fuck this

1129
00:52:18,771 --> 00:52:21,650
experience is like.
And there they might have anxiety

1130
00:52:21,651 --> 00:52:22,970
because of it.
You know,

1131
00:52:22,971 --> 00:52:26,420
there's a lot of uh,
really overwhelming sensations that come

1132
00:52:26,421 --> 00:52:28,700
with that marijuana high.
And a lot of them,

1133
00:52:28,701 --> 00:52:32,510
you know,
you call it paranoia or over sensitivity

1134
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:36,200
and sometimes you get paralysis by
analysis when you're under the influence

1135
00:52:36,201 --> 00:52:39,290
of those things where it's the acute
versus chronic effect.

1136
00:52:39,710 --> 00:52:41,300
But Jujitsu,
personally,

1137
00:52:41,301 --> 00:52:43,580
my personal experience with Jujitsu and
marijuana is,

1138
00:52:43,581 --> 00:52:46,910
it's an enhancer and I've argued this,
that I think it's a performance

1139
00:52:46,911 --> 00:52:49,460
enhancing with cbd.
CBD.

1140
00:52:49,550 --> 00:52:50,930
No,
just marijuana.

1141
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:53,330
That's what,
that's what a lot of endurance athletes

1142
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:53,781
are.
You know,

1143
00:52:53,781 --> 00:52:55,070
like,
like folks in the ultra running

1144
00:52:55,071 --> 00:52:58,910
communities and now like they'll use
like a trace amount of thc combined with

1145
00:52:58,911 --> 00:53:01,640
cbd,
like four to one to attend to one cbd to

1146
00:53:01,641 --> 00:53:04,370
thc ratio.
And I think you know now with the farm

1147
00:53:04,371 --> 00:53:08,360
bill and increasingly gallery,
I think this idea of developing sports

1148
00:53:08,361 --> 00:53:11,480
performance supplements for athletes,
you know who aren't competing in sports

1149
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:16,280
that is band are going to be steered in
the direction of like high cbd and then

1150
00:53:16,281 --> 00:53:17,920
some of these other novel molecules,
right?

1151
00:53:17,921 --> 00:53:20,930
Like CBG or CBN.
I'm not aware of this.

1152
00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:21,470
What are those?
Yeah,

1153
00:53:21,470 --> 00:53:24,460
there's,
there's all these different terpenes.

1154
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:26,070
Yes,
CBN

1155
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:29,580
or cannabinoids.
THC eight is an antiinflammatory that's

1156
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:34,581
totally different than thc nine ladies
from orally ingesting it or from smoking

1157
00:53:34,651 --> 00:53:39,120
it or they actually are an owl isolating
these in labs almost like organic

1158
00:53:39,121 --> 00:53:40,470
chemistry and you,
you,

1159
00:53:40,471 --> 00:53:45,471
you can take hemp or marijuana and you
can actually isolate specific compounds

1160
00:53:46,411 --> 00:53:48,180
and then combine them.
So you could take,

1161
00:53:48,181 --> 00:53:53,181
like you could take like CBG CBD,
combine that with other turpines from

1162
00:53:53,311 --> 00:53:56,850
like whatever.
Let's say lavender and Valerian and

1163
00:53:56,890 --> 00:54:01,170
camomile and make like a,
like a de stress relaxation type of

1164
00:54:01,171 --> 00:54:03,570
compounds.
Or You could do like a,

1165
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:08,040
like a thc but a thc eight instead of a
thc nine and combine that with like

1166
00:54:08,310 --> 00:54:11,700
cinnamon and peppermint,
maybe some caffeine or creatine or

1167
00:54:11,701 --> 00:54:14,760
something like that to make like more of
a pick me up type of compound.

1168
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:17,880
But I think that's,
that's the wave of the future when it

1169
00:54:17,881 --> 00:54:21,630
comes to a lot of these,
these marijuana companies that are

1170
00:54:21,631 --> 00:54:24,090
developing stuff for specific goals.

1171
00:54:24,210 --> 00:54:27,540
I know a lot of folks that are trying to
cbd that use it for information,

1172
00:54:27,541 --> 00:54:30,090
especially athletes like it with a
little bit of Thc,

1173
00:54:30,091 --> 00:54:32,280
they seem to think it's more effective.
You know,

1174
00:54:32,281 --> 00:54:36,330
there's some sort of a combined effect
of the thc with the CVD.

1175
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:37,171
Yeah.
Yeah.

1176
00:54:37,171 --> 00:54:39,630
They call that the a,
the entourage effect,

1177
00:54:39,810 --> 00:54:41,820
you know,
when you have all the different terpenes

1178
00:54:41,821 --> 00:54:43,660
and the endocannabinoid,
which one's turtle?

1179
00:54:43,850 --> 00:54:45,630
Yeah.
Which one's turtle have no clue.

1180
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:47,670
So,
um,

1181
00:54:47,670 --> 00:54:50,460
there's hundreds of different,
different cannabinoids,

1182
00:54:50,461 --> 00:54:52,350
right?
I don't think there's hundreds.

1183
00:54:52,410 --> 00:54:54,210
Well,
I think there's at least dozens.

1184
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:56,280
I don't know about hundreds.
How many of them,

1185
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:57,360
I mean if,
if you,

1186
00:54:57,361 --> 00:55:00,330
if you look at a chart of the different
Endo cannabinoids,

1187
00:55:00,331 --> 00:55:05,331
they've actually discovered if you were
to just google 113 yeah.

1188
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:07,980
So it's a lot.
It's a lot of fucking cannabinoids.

1189
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:09,270
I wonder.
Yeah,

1190
00:55:09,330 --> 00:55:12,990
I wonder if there'll be able to like
design something that gives you the high

1191
00:55:12,991 --> 00:55:15,700
without the paranoia or gives you the,
you know,

1192
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:18,600
various effects without spacing out.

1193
00:55:18,870 --> 00:55:20,150
Yeah,
I think that's,

1194
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:22,410
that's where supplementation is going in
general,

1195
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:24,120
right?
It's just like we were talking about

1196
00:55:24,121 --> 00:55:26,790
with Diet,
how based on your genetics,

1197
00:55:26,791 --> 00:55:28,480
based in your blood work based and your
bio,

1198
00:55:28,670 --> 00:55:30,630
that's how you would choose your diet.
I mean like,

1199
00:55:30,930 --> 00:55:32,130
you know,
like the carnivore diet.

1200
00:55:32,131 --> 00:55:33,510
If you're,
if you're,

1201
00:55:33,511 --> 00:55:38,370
let's say like sub Saharan African or
South East Asia and you have high levels

1202
00:55:38,371 --> 00:55:38,940
of,
you know,

1203
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:41,760
there are genes for salivary amylase,
there's one called the am.

1204
00:55:41,761 --> 00:55:45,270
Why one gene?
There are genes responsible for you

1205
00:55:45,271 --> 00:55:50,271
having a higher inflammatory response to
saturated fat or a ketogenic diet or

1206
00:55:50,611 --> 00:55:55,611
like there's one called the apoe gene,
apoe e three for which I have dictates

1207
00:55:55,891 --> 00:55:58,470
that even though I personally kind of
like a higher fat,

1208
00:55:58,471 --> 00:56:01,740
low carbohydrate diet,
the majority of my fats come from

1209
00:56:01,741 --> 00:56:03,220
Mediterranean fat sources.
You know,

1210
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:06,240
a lot of olive oils like avocado oil,
a lot of fish.

1211
00:56:06,870 --> 00:56:11,580
And I do that because my genetics
dictate that,

1212
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:13,500
you know,
my macronutrient ratio,

1213
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:18,680
my diet is gonna is gonna be best suited
to that specific ratio of fats.

1214
00:56:19,470 --> 00:56:21,570
But you could say the same thing with
supplements.

1215
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:23,040
You know,
I think with supplements,

1216
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:25,060
with,
with all these different places that

1217
00:56:25,061 --> 00:56:26,680
will self quantify,
you know,

1218
00:56:27,130 --> 00:56:31,420
like wellness fx and inside track in 23
in me,

1219
00:56:31,421 --> 00:56:32,080
you know,
and you can,

1220
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:36,500
you can take all of this data,
put it together and actually determined,

1221
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:38,140
you know,
whatever my,

1222
00:56:38,650 --> 00:56:42,100
everybody's saying was supposed to take
2000 international units of vitamin D a

1223
00:56:42,101 --> 00:56:44,650
Day.
If your vitamin D levels are like 80 or

1224
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:47,110
90,
then that could cause arterial

1225
00:56:47,111 --> 00:56:49,900
calcification if you're taking excess
vitamin D.

1226
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:53,890
Um,
I had both myself and my kids tested for

1227
00:56:53,891 --> 00:56:54,820
our,
for our genetics,

1228
00:56:54,821 --> 00:56:59,440
like none of us boys in the Greenfield
family actually have the gene that

1229
00:56:59,441 --> 00:57:03,430
allows us to generate appreciable
amounts of vitamin D from sunlight.

1230
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:07,090
So we all now supplement with vitamin D,
vitamin K,

1231
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:10,660
my boys,
neither of them possess the enzyme or

1232
00:57:10,661 --> 00:57:11,620
the or the,
um,

1233
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,380
I guess it is an enzyme superoxide
dismutase.

1234
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:18,670
It's a gene that allows for increased
expression of this enzyme that allows

1235
00:57:18,671 --> 00:57:20,260
for glutathione production,
right?

1236
00:57:20,261 --> 00:57:22,750
So they take glutathione now,
um,

1237
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:27,780
they have the one that results in a
lower than normal level of bdnf,

1238
00:57:28,210 --> 00:57:32,020
brain derived neurotrophic factor,
the stuff that's like miracle grow for

1239
00:57:32,021 --> 00:57:34,600
the brain.
So they use lion's mane extract now

1240
00:57:34,601 --> 00:57:36,370
before school.
So I,

1241
00:57:36,371 --> 00:57:41,371
I like the idea of doing a genetic test
and doing a blood test and looking at

1242
00:57:41,770 --> 00:57:44,740
what your ancestors would have eaten if
you happen to have,

1243
00:57:45,790 --> 00:57:49,990
I guess kind of like a clean enough to
interpret ancestral profile to be able

1244
00:57:49,991 --> 00:57:50,471
to say,
well,

1245
00:57:50,471 --> 00:57:51,070
here's,
you know,

1246
00:57:51,070 --> 00:57:54,100
I'm mostly northern European so this is
what I'm going to do well On.

1247
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:56,110
You combine all that stuff.
I think,

1248
00:57:56,130 --> 00:57:57,520
you know,
returning to your question about the

1249
00:57:57,521 --> 00:58:01,390
carnivore diet,
that's the way to eat this apoe e four

1250
00:58:01,391 --> 00:58:04,180
is also leaves you predisposed to ct,
correct?

1251
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:04,991
Yeah.
Yeah.

1252
00:58:04,991 --> 00:58:09,280
Or you have that higher risk.
Now I've got the April e three m three

1253
00:58:09,281 --> 00:58:13,600
four three four eight four four is the
one that's more concerning.

1254
00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:16,660
Yeah.
And you get a very deleterious response

1255
00:58:16,661 --> 00:58:19,000
in many cases to,
to fats.

1256
00:58:19,001 --> 00:58:20,770
You know,
it's like an inflammatory response to

1257
00:58:20,771 --> 00:58:21,830
fats.
Very similar,

1258
00:58:22,210 --> 00:58:24,250
very similar.
Like if you had familial

1259
00:58:24,251 --> 00:58:26,110
hypercholesterolemia,
you know,

1260
00:58:26,111 --> 00:58:29,620
and you get on like a a Kenogenic Diet
for example,

1261
00:58:29,621 --> 00:58:33,700
and your cholesterol goes up to 500 I
mean that's something that just doesn't

1262
00:58:33,701 --> 00:58:35,140
agree with a lot of people.
Yeah.

1263
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:37,450
That's what's really important to
discuss.

1264
00:58:37,451 --> 00:58:40,120
Right.
Everybody's body really does respond

1265
00:58:40,121 --> 00:58:42,320
differently to all sorts of different
diets and yeah,

1266
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:45,370
it's so difficult for people,
especially if they don't have a lot of

1267
00:58:45,371 --> 00:58:47,260
research in the field.

1268
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:48,700
If they don't know how,
you know they're not,

1269
00:58:48,701 --> 00:58:52,450
they haven't read a lot about it to try
to determine what's the best diet for

1270
00:58:52,451 --> 00:58:53,320
them.
Yeah,

1271
00:58:53,321 --> 00:58:54,190
there are,
there are.

1272
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:59,520
There are specific characteristics
though that regardless of macronutrient

1273
00:58:59,741 --> 00:59:04,741
ratios and regardless of food
composition you see over and over again

1274
00:59:04,781 --> 00:59:09,781
in centenarians or in people who are
living in a blue zone or people who have

1275
00:59:10,151 --> 00:59:13,870
the absence of a lot of,
of disease risk factors or are high risk

1276
00:59:13,871 --> 00:59:17,380
of mortality.
Like we see regular periods of caloric

1277
00:59:17,381 --> 00:59:20,950
restriction like at some point other
compressed feeding window or

1278
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:22,700
intermittent fasting or like,
you know,

1279
00:59:22,970 --> 00:59:25,730
the Mediterranean diet,
everybody talks about goat cheese and

1280
00:59:25,731 --> 00:59:29,300
all of oil and fish and eggs.
But not a lot of people talk about the

1281
00:59:29,301 --> 00:59:32,690
religious aspect of that.
That includes certain periods of time

1282
00:59:32,691 --> 00:59:37,100
where you fast certain periods of time
where you don't eat meat certain days,

1283
00:59:37,101 --> 00:59:40,250
where where you aren't drowning all your
food in olive oil.

1284
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:41,630
All right.
And so,

1285
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:44,810
um,
you know,

1286
00:59:44,811 --> 00:59:45,800
it's,
it's uh,

1287
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:50,690
in terms of other characteristics that
you see,

1288
00:59:50,810 --> 00:59:52,580
um,
glycaemic variability,

1289
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:56,360
right?
You see very low periods of glucose

1290
00:59:56,361 --> 01:00:00,320
fluctuations occurring throughout the
day because of a high intake of either

1291
01:00:00,470 --> 01:00:04,580
fiber or legumes is a big one that you
see in the blue zones,

1292
01:00:04,581 --> 01:00:06,590
right?
Like high intake of things like lentils.

1293
01:00:06,591 --> 01:00:09,950
And Split Mung beans and a lot of these
things that get thrown under the bus now

1294
01:00:09,951 --> 01:00:12,650
where we're talking about lectins and
got damaged,

1295
01:00:12,651 --> 01:00:15,350
but ultimately returning back to what I
said earlier,

1296
01:00:15,351 --> 01:00:18,500
soaking and sprouting and fermentation
makes a lot of those things.

1297
01:00:18,530 --> 01:00:20,320
Can I pause?
You are not aware of that.

1298
01:00:20,570 --> 01:00:23,210
What are the issues with lectins and so
the issue with Lectins,

1299
01:00:23,211 --> 01:00:27,350
and this is based on a on a book that
was published I think about two years

1300
01:00:27,351 --> 01:00:32,180
ago called the plant paradox by doctor
Steven gundry and he talks about how

1301
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:37,720
lectins are these builtin natural plant
defense mechanisms that are in primarily

1302
01:00:38,541 --> 01:00:43,541
plants and seeds and the skins of
certain fruits and vegetables that will

1303
01:00:43,551 --> 01:00:47,330
cause your digestive track to become
damaged or give you a deleterious or

1304
01:00:47,331 --> 01:00:49,040
inflammatory response to that food.

1305
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:51,920
Kind of a similar argument as the Paleo
people make,

1306
01:00:51,921 --> 01:00:52,611
right?
They say,

1307
01:00:52,611 --> 01:00:53,444
well,
you don't,

1308
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:56,930
don't eat dairy because that could have
inflammatory proteins in it that might

1309
01:00:56,931 --> 01:01:01,931
cause an autoimmune reaction or or
donate bread because of the gluten and

1310
01:01:02,481 --> 01:01:06,530
the phytic acid.
But when when you step back and you look

1311
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:08,420
out a lot of,
a lot of blue zones,

1312
01:01:08,421 --> 01:01:10,910
a lot of longevity hotspots,
a lot of centenarians,

1313
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:16,300
you don't see avoidance of these foods.
You see smart preparation of them,

1314
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:18,890
right?
When you hunt,

1315
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:23,720
you don't set up in a tree with a like a
dagger and your teeth like Peter Pan and

1316
01:01:23,870 --> 01:01:27,570
jump out of the tree on the back of a
deer and,

1317
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:30,140
and you know,
just start eating the deer,

1318
01:01:30,170 --> 01:01:31,610
right?
Like you have to go through a pretty

1319
01:01:31,611 --> 01:01:34,370
long process of tracking and stalking
and hunting and,

1320
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:36,170
and Phil dressing and quartering.

1321
01:01:36,170 --> 01:01:37,220
And even then,
you know,

1322
01:01:37,221 --> 01:01:38,660
there,
there's a pretty intensive cooking

1323
01:01:38,661 --> 01:01:40,820
process and we do things like,
you know,

1324
01:01:40,821 --> 01:01:44,090
like coffee rubs and things to decrease
the amount of carcinogens in the meat

1325
01:01:44,091 --> 01:01:47,870
when you cook it and we dry age and
you'll take the organ meats and soak

1326
01:01:47,871 --> 01:01:51,200
them in lemon juice or buttermilk to
remove the flavor and blah,

1327
01:01:51,201 --> 01:01:52,490
blah blah.
But stop,

1328
01:01:52,491 --> 01:01:52,970
stop,
stop.

1329
01:01:52,970 --> 01:01:53,580
Okay,
hold on.

1330
01:01:53,580 --> 01:01:55,520
I've got to do this.
Otherwise I forget.

1331
01:01:55,550 --> 01:01:56,960
Coffee rubs.
What does it,

1332
01:01:56,990 --> 01:01:59,420
how does it decrease the amount of
carcinogens?

1333
01:01:59,510 --> 01:02:02,960
Well Coffee Rosemary time,
a lot of these things that we use as

1334
01:02:02,961 --> 01:02:05,030
rubs,
one of the benefits of them as they

1335
01:02:05,031 --> 01:02:08,120
decrease the formation of a lot of these
carcinogenic compounds in the meat,

1336
01:02:08,150 --> 01:02:08,871
you know,
like the burnt,

1337
01:02:08,871 --> 01:02:12,050
charred components of the meat.
Anything that's an antioxidant,

1338
01:02:12,530 --> 01:02:13,430
right?
And you could,

1339
01:02:13,431 --> 01:02:16,190
you could just go on your spice cover
and start to make up rubs based on this

1340
01:02:16,191 --> 01:02:17,024
concept.

1341
01:02:17,030 --> 01:02:18,950
Anything that would be,
you know,

1342
01:02:19,170 --> 01:02:22,650
these sirtuin precursors that people are
talking about now for anti aging,

1343
01:02:22,651 --> 01:02:26,190
like blueberries and red wine and dark
chocolate and dark purple fruits and

1344
01:02:26,191 --> 01:02:27,150
berries,
et Cetera,

1345
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:29,100
you dry those,
you powder those,

1346
01:02:29,130 --> 01:02:30,510
that's a great rub,
right?

1347
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:34,860
Because all of a sudden you're
decreasing the carcinogenics aspects of

1348
01:02:34,861 --> 01:02:39,030
burnt meet or charred meat or are
heavily cooks proteins particularly.

1349
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:44,420
So the idea is you want to prepare your
food in a manner that renders it

1350
01:02:46,201 --> 01:02:49,020
digestible and that unlocks the
nutrients.

1351
01:02:49,350 --> 01:02:53,160
And so when we talk about dietary
customization,

1352
01:02:53,490 --> 01:02:57,360
not only do you see calorie restriction
compressed feeding windows,

1353
01:02:57,540 --> 01:03:01,140
fasting as one element,
that regardless of the Diet that you

1354
01:03:01,141 --> 01:03:04,140
choose has been shown to improve health
and lifespan.

1355
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:07,920
But you also see low amounts of glycemic
variability.

1356
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:12,240
You see a high amount of emphasis placed
on rendering the food digestible.

1357
01:03:12,450 --> 01:03:14,280
Again,
no matter what it is that you're eating.

1358
01:03:14,580 --> 01:03:19,580
And so whether you're eating a ketogenic
diet or a carnivore diet or a high carb,

1359
01:03:19,621 --> 01:03:20,460
low fat,
high fat,

1360
01:03:20,461 --> 01:03:22,050
low carb,
what have you,

1361
01:03:22,110 --> 01:03:26,790
the idea is you try to choose real
recognizable food,

1362
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:30,780
then you render that digestible and you
eat as many different food groups as you

1363
01:03:30,781 --> 01:03:35,781
can eat based on self experimentation
primarily until you land on that diet

1364
01:03:35,881 --> 01:03:38,190
that that works well for you.
And if you can combine that with self

1365
01:03:38,191 --> 01:03:40,620
qualification,
blood biomarkers,

1366
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:42,870
look at your microbiome,
look at your genetics.

1367
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:47,250
I mean there's no reason that that most
people shouldn't just be able to eat the

1368
01:03:47,251 --> 01:03:51,210
diet that works for their body,
but it's a hard thing to discover the,

1369
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:54,330
the idea that you can figure out what
works best for you.

1370
01:03:54,331 --> 01:03:57,690
Look what feels best.
Like people start convincing themselves,

1371
01:03:57,840 --> 01:04:00,000
you know?
But one thing is more beneficial to the

1372
01:04:00,001 --> 01:04:02,820
other and that's one of the things that
people wonder about,

1373
01:04:02,821 --> 01:04:04,110
this whole carnivore thing.

1374
01:04:04,110 --> 01:04:06,630
It was like,
are they mind fucking themselves or

1375
01:04:06,631 --> 01:04:10,620
they're giving themselves a placebo
benefit of only eating this way and you

1376
01:04:10,621 --> 01:04:14,250
just go to Sean Baker's instagram every
day and you hashtag meet heels and

1377
01:04:14,251 --> 01:04:15,084
you're like,
yes,

1378
01:04:15,210 --> 01:04:16,980
meets healing me,
and you start the,

1379
01:04:17,470 --> 01:04:19,530
it's a church.
It's a religion.

1380
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:22,290
It's a nutrition is highly religious and
dogmatic.

1381
01:04:22,410 --> 01:04:25,380
Well,
the carnivore diet people are the exact

1382
01:04:25,381 --> 01:04:28,730
opposite of the Vegan people.
They're the same but different there.

1383
01:04:28,830 --> 01:04:32,430
They're all just preaching that you
should only meat and meets the thing and

1384
01:04:32,431 --> 01:04:37,431
you know they're mocking vegans.
Vegans are mocking the cow or you know,

1385
01:04:37,620 --> 01:04:40,140
saying disparaging things about people
who eat meat.

1386
01:04:40,290 --> 01:04:43,020
It's really seminal issue is the same
thing though.

1387
01:04:43,050 --> 01:04:47,460
It's the fact that when you start on a
highly restrictive diet that tends to be

1388
01:04:47,461 --> 01:04:50,340
dogmatic to like,
I'm going to only eat meat.

1389
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:53,820
I'm not going to have meat.
I'm going to only eat vegetables.

1390
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:56,910
You feel pretty good,
like you feel a difference.

1391
01:04:56,911 --> 01:04:59,280
It's impossible not to feel a difference
once you go,

1392
01:04:59,340 --> 01:05:02,970
go completely myopic on your diet and
have a very limited number of food

1393
01:05:02,971 --> 01:05:05,670
choices.
But we know that vegans buildup deficits

1394
01:05:05,671 --> 01:05:08,490
and creating in taurine in,
you know,

1395
01:05:08,491 --> 01:05:13,491
unless the reading log and stuff like
that and Dha and epa in fatty acids and

1396
01:05:14,011 --> 01:05:16,770
amino acids,
long term deficits and cortisol which

1397
01:05:16,771 --> 01:05:17,980
affects cell membranes,

1398
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:21,520
you can definitely do it right.
I mean there's dudes like you know for

1399
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:22,540
can rich roll,
right?

1400
01:05:22,541 --> 01:05:25,270
Like great guy and he and and he's into
like the,

1401
01:05:25,271 --> 01:05:26,320
you know,
fermentation,

1402
01:05:26,321 --> 01:05:28,930
soaking and sprouting and super foods
and you know,

1403
01:05:28,931 --> 01:05:30,760
it's,
it's honestly kind of expensive and time

1404
01:05:30,761 --> 01:05:32,470
consuming to do a Vegan diet the right
way.

1405
01:05:32,471 --> 01:05:34,660
But you could do it.
A lot of people don't,

1406
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:38,020
but if you're not careful,
you build up deficits longterm even

1407
01:05:38,021 --> 01:05:41,360
though you feel really good short term
as the same thing with,

1408
01:05:41,361 --> 01:05:43,960
with something like a carnivore diet,
like you're probably going to build up

1409
01:05:43,961 --> 01:05:47,020
some kind of microbiome bacterial
deficiencies unless you're eating the

1410
01:05:47,350 --> 01:05:51,430
intestines of ruminants or I suppose
supplementing with some kind of really

1411
01:05:51,431 --> 01:05:54,610
good probiotic.
Let's just fascinating because they find

1412
01:05:54,611 --> 01:05:56,320
these people that have been doing it for
20 years,

1413
01:05:56,321 --> 01:05:57,940
they,
they pull these folks out of the woods,

1414
01:05:57,970 --> 01:05:58,451
like,
look,

1415
01:05:58,451 --> 01:06:00,450
we've got this one guy,
he's been doing it for 18 years.

1416
01:06:00,470 --> 01:06:01,810
Look how healthy they are.
They sell,

1417
01:06:02,110 --> 01:06:04,950
show someone doing chin ups.
But the reality is you,

1418
01:06:04,951 --> 01:06:08,500
you don't really hear about that die or
you didn't really hear about that diet

1419
01:06:08,501 --> 01:06:10,400
until like three or four years ago.
Right.

1420
01:06:10,450 --> 01:06:14,710
And much more so over the last two years
probably because of me accidentally

1421
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:17,620
having all these people on and talking
about it and it's,

1422
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:19,900
and you know,
people like Jordan that have had,

1423
01:06:20,330 --> 01:06:22,240
look,
it's impossible to deny the benefits

1424
01:06:22,241 --> 01:06:24,280
that he's gotten.
The guy looks fantastic and just a

1425
01:06:24,281 --> 01:06:25,590
tremendous amount of weight.
And,

1426
01:06:26,050 --> 01:06:29,210
but to your point,
that is most likely because of it,

1427
01:06:29,211 --> 01:06:32,110
an elimination diet and whatever was
fucking with him before.

1428
01:06:32,111 --> 01:06:33,730
And I think,
you know,

1429
01:06:33,910 --> 01:06:37,780
most people that start off with a poor
die and then switch to a restricted

1430
01:06:37,781 --> 01:06:39,520
diet,
they're just going to be better because

1431
01:06:39,521 --> 01:06:42,100
they don't have the,
the stuff that's poor and they don't

1432
01:06:42,101 --> 01:06:44,110
have the trans fats,
they don't have all the sugar,

1433
01:06:44,111 --> 01:06:45,160
they don't have all the nonsense.

1434
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:48,100
It's probably causing a good deal of the
information in the first place.

1435
01:06:48,250 --> 01:06:53,250
So by eliminating all those bad things
from their diet and then concentrating

1436
01:06:53,321 --> 01:06:57,130
on the one thing that they all,
the only one thing that they're eating,

1437
01:06:57,131 --> 01:07:00,280
you think the one thing they're eating
is causing all the benefits when it's

1438
01:07:00,281 --> 01:07:03,400
probably the lack of the bad things.
Exactly.

1439
01:07:03,430 --> 01:07:05,890
It's an,
it's a fancy elimination diet,

1440
01:07:06,130 --> 01:07:07,420
so,
but it's a delicious one.

1441
01:07:07,630 --> 01:07:09,100
It is.
Speaking of delicious,

1442
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:10,890
are you hunting at all?
Yes.

1443
01:07:10,990 --> 01:07:12,640
Yes.
What's your hunt?

1444
01:07:12,670 --> 01:07:14,950
Well,
I mean I'm going through the two elk

1445
01:07:14,951 --> 01:07:17,770
that I've given away a lot of it too.
And I shot last year,

1446
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:20,770
every year I scheduled to elk hunts and,
uh,

1447
01:07:20,890 --> 01:07:23,650
assume I'm going to strike out.
And,

1448
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:25,960
uh,
the last two years I've been very lucky

1449
01:07:25,961 --> 01:07:29,350
and I got to elk each year.
So it's breaking the rules of the secret

1450
01:07:29,351 --> 01:07:30,550
in think and grow rich,
you know,

1451
01:07:30,551 --> 01:07:32,020
to assume you're going to strike out.

1452
01:07:32,050 --> 01:07:36,040
Well I supposed to sit cross legged in
your son and manifest that shows.

1453
01:07:36,970 --> 01:07:41,440
Yeah,
I work hard but I assume it's a hard

1454
01:07:41,441 --> 01:07:45,520
thing to do to fucking it is and people
don't realize they don't and he'll,

1455
01:07:45,521 --> 01:07:48,820
he'll look at a clip like there's clips
of me online and the clip is like a

1456
01:07:48,821 --> 01:07:50,740
minute long and it seems like,
oh look,

1457
01:07:50,741 --> 01:07:54,430
look how easy you don't see stalking in
for hours.

1458
01:07:54,431 --> 01:07:57,790
You don't see the hundreds of hours of
shooting arrows.

1459
01:07:57,940 --> 01:08:01,030
The coaching from John Dudley,
all the reading,

1460
01:08:01,060 --> 01:08:06,060
archery articles and understanding what,
keeping your mindset clear in the

1461
01:08:06,221 --> 01:08:08,260
moment.
It's a lot of difficult to long haul.

1462
01:08:08,290 --> 01:08:11,980
My boys have their first hunt in three
months and we'll kind of,

1463
01:08:11,981 --> 01:08:15,530
we've been prepping for seven months.
They're doing bow hunt and Kona real

1464
01:08:15,531 --> 01:08:16,130
pig.

1465
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:17,480
Oh my,
my wife,

1466
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:20,360
she's going to have to sheep or is it
going to have to pay the 10?

1467
01:08:20,860 --> 01:08:22,970
So when you're getting him a crossbow,
no,

1468
01:08:23,030 --> 01:08:24,470
no,
they're right now they're shooting a

1469
01:08:24,471 --> 01:08:27,080
hoyts ignite.
Um,

1470
01:08:27,140 --> 01:08:31,340
they're shooting at about 25 yards,
justice shooting at about 40 yards.

1471
01:08:31,670 --> 01:08:34,580
And how many people live in prepping?
They're about 45 now,

1472
01:08:34,730 --> 01:08:36,430
which is going to be enough.
That's enough.

1473
01:08:36,910 --> 01:08:38,330
Yeah.
But I mean there's still,

1474
01:08:38,650 --> 01:08:39,740
I mean there's still,
when they,

1475
01:08:39,741 --> 01:08:43,550
when they draw their pointing up Poland,
so they've still got a couple more

1476
01:08:43,550 --> 01:08:45,830
months of training to,
to really get dialed in.

1477
01:08:46,310 --> 01:08:48,320
Um,
but yeah,

1478
01:08:48,380 --> 01:08:49,400
it's,
it's difficult.

1479
01:08:49,401 --> 01:08:51,290
I still haven't even gotten my elk bow
hunting.

1480
01:08:51,650 --> 01:08:53,180
You know,
I spent my last time,

1481
01:08:53,181 --> 01:08:56,150
I spent six days up in the Colorado
mountain range and the,

1482
01:08:56,151 --> 01:08:57,560
uh,
the,

1483
01:08:57,561 --> 01:09:00,380
um,
what they called the Santa De Cristo

1484
01:09:00,380 --> 01:09:04,550
Range.
And on the last day I finally came in on

1485
01:09:04,551 --> 01:09:08,210
elk and it was dark and I shot and I
missed.

1486
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:12,190
And that was after seven fricking days
of trying.

1487
01:09:12,220 --> 01:09:15,530
And you walk out your horse out
completely empty handed.

1488
01:09:15,531 --> 01:09:19,490
It's about 45 yards in dusk.
But you know,

1489
01:09:19,580 --> 01:09:20,480
I mean,
you know how it goes.

1490
01:09:20,481 --> 01:09:21,890
You're shaking.
It's so dark.

1491
01:09:21,891 --> 01:09:22,724
And,
yeah.

1492
01:09:23,140 --> 01:09:24,800
Um,
anyways though,

1493
01:09:24,801 --> 01:09:27,860
so I'm going to do a,
I'm going to do Kona,

1494
01:09:28,030 --> 01:09:29,690
actually gonna get you in touch with
Dudley,

1495
01:09:30,020 --> 01:09:31,100
cause I know,
been in touch with him.

1496
01:09:31,101 --> 01:09:32,930
We've talked before.
I know how you shoot.

1497
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:37,050
You shoot with a finger trigger to fire.
Yeah,

1498
01:09:37,370 --> 01:09:38,470
I need to,
it's,

1499
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:39,730
it's on my list.
But

1500
01:09:39,900 --> 01:09:42,280
there's those moments like that when
you,

1501
01:09:42,340 --> 01:09:46,570
you're hunting for six days and you just
trekking through the woods 20 miles a

1502
01:09:46,571 --> 01:09:49,660
day and you're exhausted and you finally
get that one moment.

1503
01:09:49,661 --> 01:09:54,661
There's so much weight on that moment
that it's so difficult to stay focused

1504
01:09:55,271 --> 01:09:58,330
entirely on the task of executing the
shot perfectly.

1505
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:02,710
And there's methods.
There's a guy named Joel Turner who has,

1506
01:10:02,711 --> 01:10:06,010
um,
he's got a website called iron mine

1507
01:10:06,011 --> 01:10:07,300
hunting.
He's a,

1508
01:10:07,460 --> 01:10:09,070
uh,
he's a,

1509
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:11,890
he's an instructor for,
um,

1510
01:10:11,980 --> 01:10:14,410
uh,
first responders and snipers and things

1511
01:10:14,411 --> 01:10:15,610
along those lines.
Iron mind,

1512
01:10:15,730 --> 01:10:16,860
iron mine.
Where's she live?

1513
01:10:17,860 --> 01:10:20,240
I think he's a Pacific northwest guy
and,

1514
01:10:20,241 --> 01:10:21,880
uh,
he's helped me tremendously.

1515
01:10:21,910 --> 01:10:23,170
His,
his methods.

1516
01:10:23,410 --> 01:10:26,240
It's all about keeping a,
uh,

1517
01:10:26,390 --> 01:10:29,710
the difference between an open loop
system in a closed loop system.

1518
01:10:30,190 --> 01:10:34,210
Be Able to control it and stop it and
stop the process anytime you want and

1519
01:10:34,211 --> 01:10:37,660
keeping yourself in that versus like a
baseball bat swing,

1520
01:10:37,780 --> 01:10:39,580
which is once you start swinging,
just swinging.

1521
01:10:40,090 --> 01:10:43,500
And the idea is to,
to maintain the present nt,

1522
01:10:43,540 --> 01:10:47,560
to have a mantra and he gives you a
mantra to chant and to think about it in

1523
01:10:47,561 --> 01:10:50,280
terms of controlling all of those
movements.

1524
01:10:50,281 --> 01:10:53,640
So you are in control constantly.
Well you,

1525
01:10:53,641 --> 01:10:57,400
you develop your own,
but the idea is to talk yourself through

1526
01:10:57,401 --> 01:11:00,390
it.
Don't let your excitable mind take over.

1527
01:11:00,450 --> 01:11:04,210
I'll just with it up a little,
he freak out and you pull the trigger

1528
01:11:04,211 --> 01:11:06,910
and you shoot fucking over the things
back and you don't even know what

1529
01:11:06,911 --> 01:11:08,010
happened.
What's your mantra?

1530
01:11:08,050 --> 01:11:09,680
Lost?
Um,

1531
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:12,760
I,
I pull back and I say dry.

1532
01:11:12,790 --> 01:11:16,500
I through all the steps in my head that
I'm supposed to do,

1533
01:11:16,650 --> 01:11:21,540
I actually modified his and,
and went to John Dudley's.

1534
01:11:22,140 --> 01:11:24,570
So his,
he has his own one,

1535
01:11:24,930 --> 01:11:28,230
which is a drawback in aim.
Get it done,

1536
01:11:28,231 --> 01:11:31,230
watch it to keep it in the,
the whole idea is just keeping those

1537
01:11:31,231 --> 01:11:32,220
things in your head.

1538
01:11:32,340 --> 01:11:35,100
So you have one thing,
but what would dudley,

1539
01:11:35,101 --> 01:11:38,010
I go through all the different things
that he says,

1540
01:11:38,011 --> 01:11:42,110
like a drawback,
tip of the nose center,

1541
01:11:42,111 --> 01:11:44,730
the peep center,
the bubble pulled through the shot,

1542
01:11:44,910 --> 01:11:45,541
pull,
pull,

1543
01:11:45,541 --> 01:11:46,710
pull,
let the shop break.

1544
01:11:47,070 --> 01:11:49,560
And so I go through all those things in
my mind.

1545
01:11:49,740 --> 01:11:52,080
But the whole idea is that not allow the
freak out.

1546
01:11:52,170 --> 01:11:54,480
Cause the freak out is what causes the
target panic.

1547
01:11:54,810 --> 01:11:57,750
And when you have that itchy trigger
finger with the finger trigger,

1548
01:11:57,751 --> 01:11:59,310
you look good.
And that's,

1549
01:11:59,610 --> 01:12:00,510
that's,
I've done it.

1550
01:12:00,540 --> 01:12:01,920
I mean I've seen it,
I've done it,

1551
01:12:01,921 --> 01:12:02,790
I've seen it,
I've heard it.

1552
01:12:02,791 --> 01:12:05,490
Everybody does it.
The Arrow goes in the spot.

1553
01:12:05,670 --> 01:12:08,550
You know where you're yanking it and
you're pulling it.

1554
01:12:08,551 --> 01:12:12,600
He's not very precise and want to get it
to where it's a surprise shock.

1555
01:12:13,230 --> 01:12:17,160
And when it's a surprise shot,
you're just concentrating entirely on

1556
01:12:17,220 --> 01:12:18,990
the area that you want to hit on the
ALC.

1557
01:12:19,230 --> 01:12:21,810
Your form is perfect,
everything's aligned in order.

1558
01:12:21,811 --> 01:12:24,480
And if it's not,
you let down if it's not you let down

1559
01:12:24,481 --> 01:12:27,990
and tried to get your shit together.
She was trained to hunt competitions.

1560
01:12:27,991 --> 01:12:32,010
Helped me out quite a bit I'm sure.
But it's like a three day shoot but they

1561
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:33,990
were churning around here getting
exhausted.

1562
01:12:34,030 --> 01:12:35,490
Well No,
not really.

1563
01:12:35,491 --> 01:12:36,960
Like,
like they're uh,

1564
01:12:36,990 --> 01:12:40,380
they do have part of it as like that,
like an obstacle course race with your

1565
01:12:40,381 --> 01:12:42,230
bowl.
But then part of it too is just a three

1566
01:12:42,231 --> 01:12:43,710
day shoot.
But like,

1567
01:12:43,711 --> 01:12:47,430
uh,
like a a 40 target three day shoot where

1568
01:12:47,431 --> 01:12:51,630
one shot might be on facing you,
but the targets behind me and you've got

1569
01:12:51,631 --> 01:12:56,631
a ten second time span to draw,
turn and shoot or you got to take a shot

1570
01:12:57,480 --> 01:13:02,480
seeded through the trees at 40 yards and
then within 20 seconds to a shot at 60

1571
01:13:04,201 --> 01:13:04,560
yards.

1572
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:07,920
So it's a lot of hunting scenario.
We would tell you that that is going to

1573
01:13:07,921 --> 01:13:10,680
cause target panic,
that that whole thing of shoot now that

1574
01:13:10,681 --> 01:13:14,130
you should never just do that,
that you should always execute the shot

1575
01:13:14,131 --> 01:13:16,830
correctly.
Even he doesn't even like this fucking

1576
01:13:16,831 --> 01:13:18,270
game.
This thing,

1577
01:13:18,271 --> 01:13:20,280
this a techno hunt that we,
we've done.

1578
01:13:20,430 --> 01:13:22,830
He doesn't like that.
He thinks that that thing causes target

1579
01:13:22,831 --> 01:13:25,350
panic because you only have a brief
window and you're like go,

1580
01:13:25,650 --> 01:13:28,170
it's like you,
he believes that you should concentrate

1581
01:13:28,171 --> 01:13:31,740
entirely on the correct fundamentals and
execution of archery.

1582
01:13:32,070 --> 01:13:36,260
And then with time and understanding of
the situation,

1583
01:13:36,330 --> 01:13:40,290
the experience of hunting itself,
then when those moments present

1584
01:13:40,291 --> 01:13:42,510
themselves,
you're going to execute correctly.

1585
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:45,390
Whereas when you have this like 10
seconds,

1586
01:13:45,391 --> 01:13:47,910
you've got to turn and behind your back
ready go.

1587
01:13:47,970 --> 01:13:48,680
He's like,
wow,

1588
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:49,890
you're just,
you're just going to hit that.

1589
01:13:49,890 --> 01:13:51,930
You're going to hammer that trigger.
You're going to put that pin on the

1590
01:13:51,931 --> 01:13:53,940
target and hammer that trigger and
that's just,

1591
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:59,240
you are emphasizing all the wrong things
that you could do when you're hunting.

1592
01:13:59,340 --> 01:14:00,270
Yeah.
Yeah.

1593
01:14:00,940 --> 01:14:04,170
Let me go to Hawaii next month and do a
sheep.

1594
01:14:04,350 --> 01:14:05,460
Which island?
The Big island.

1595
01:14:05,470 --> 01:14:06,540
It'd be Kona.
Kona.

1596
01:14:07,170 --> 01:14:09,030
Uh,
well I like to go down there cause you

1597
01:14:09,031 --> 01:14:12,780
can spear fish can,
you can double into spare fish.

1598
01:14:12,790 --> 01:14:16,300
So we'll do sheep and goat,
a pig,

1599
01:14:16,750 --> 01:14:19,570
possibly Turkey.
And then we'll have a couple days out on

1600
01:14:19,571 --> 01:14:21,750
the boats and that'll be actually,
uh,

1601
01:14:21,820 --> 01:14:24,280
kyle and Aubrey are going,
Oh yeah,

1602
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:26,590
Pete,
Peter t is gonna come with us.

1603
01:14:26,860 --> 01:14:31,860
So while the doctor on the trip,
and then the one I'm excited about is a

1604
01:14:32,951 --> 01:14:35,540
dall sheep up in Alaska.
So I'm going to do that.

1605
01:14:35,541 --> 01:14:39,220
The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge,
that's a float hunt.

1606
01:14:39,490 --> 01:14:41,710
So you're floating about 40 miles down
the river up there.

1607
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:45,460
You fly into a,
in a fair banks and there's a fort that

1608
01:14:45,461 --> 01:14:48,820
you fly in from there on a charter and
that'll be dall sheep,

1609
01:14:49,090 --> 01:14:52,360
Caribou and grizzlies.
That's a 10 day hunt.

1610
01:14:52,420 --> 01:14:56,200
And this is a bow hunt as well.
That'll be a bulb while be all pack.

1611
01:14:56,201 --> 01:14:57,400
Like I've got a,
yeah,

1612
01:14:57,530 --> 01:15:00,760
got a Smith and Wesson 44.
It's a big ass gun.

1613
01:15:00,850 --> 01:15:04,720
So I'll pack that and then I'll probably
have a to 72.

1614
01:15:05,110 --> 01:15:05,591
Um,
if I,

1615
01:15:05,591 --> 01:15:06,890
if I,
if I can make weight,

1616
01:15:07,110 --> 01:15:09,970
you hunt them or weapons or you just
avoiding them?

1617
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,390
No,
I'm hunting dall sheep like that.

1618
01:15:12,391 --> 01:15:14,500
That's what I really want.
That's just an adventurous,

1619
01:15:14,501 --> 01:15:17,410
I'm not much of a trophy hunting guy,
but I am an adventure guy.

1620
01:15:17,460 --> 01:15:19,720
Like I like,
I want to go out and have an amazing

1621
01:15:19,721 --> 01:15:23,100
adventure wilderness adventure because
the,

1622
01:15:23,101 --> 01:15:26,440
the,
the place where these things live is

1623
01:15:26,441 --> 01:15:29,950
some of the fucking sketchy as ground on
earth.

1624
01:15:29,950 --> 01:15:32,770
It's shale rock.
A lot of it you have to,

1625
01:15:32,771 --> 01:15:35,230
a lot of times you're wearing crampons
on your boots.

1626
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:39,430
You going to extremely high altitude in
precarious situations.

1627
01:15:39,431 --> 01:15:42,470
These little cliff peaks long packouts
uh,

1628
01:15:42,550 --> 01:15:45,550
I'll have a carer will be tag and a
grizzly tag as well.

1629
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:50,640
So if I like to shoot a grizzly because
it's charging you or to shoot a grizzle

1630
01:15:51,691 --> 01:15:53,860
cause you can,
that would actually be to harvest and

1631
01:15:53,861 --> 01:15:56,530
eat a grizzly.
I'm actually pretty,

1632
01:15:56,531 --> 01:15:57,364
you know,
I'd be like that.

1633
01:15:57,370 --> 01:15:59,410
I'm a cook.
Look at those dall sheep.

1634
01:15:59,420 --> 01:16:00,490
Yeah,
exactly.

1635
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:03,940
Exactly.
So that is an adventure right there to

1636
01:16:03,941 --> 01:16:06,520
be able to get to those little specks on
that rock.

1637
01:16:06,521 --> 01:16:08,700
So hard to be floating the river,
uh,

1638
01:16:08,710 --> 01:16:10,990
will be fishing.
They got Arctic char up there.

1639
01:16:11,350 --> 01:16:12,660
Um,
few other fish.

1640
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:14,430
Beautiful Fish.
Yeah.

1641
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:17,460
So he gets a big fatty fish,
cold water,

1642
01:16:17,461 --> 01:16:21,510
it'll be about 10 to 12 days and then
I'll just fly all the meat out and fly

1643
01:16:21,530 --> 01:16:22,300
home.

1644
01:16:22,300 --> 01:16:25,990
Now grisly as a meal.
That's a thing that where people are

1645
01:16:25,991 --> 01:16:28,270
hearing this and they're going,
what the fuck are you talking about?

1646
01:16:28,271 --> 01:16:30,760
And uh,
I had Donnie Vinson on the podcast who's

1647
01:16:30,761 --> 01:16:33,790
a,
he's a really interesting guy,

1648
01:16:33,791 --> 01:16:38,230
very educated and really,
really articulate and really like,

1649
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:41,860
like Rinella and a lot of ways,
does a great job of explaining what

1650
01:16:41,861 --> 01:16:44,740
hunting truly is about and the
conservation aspect of it.

1651
01:16:44,741 --> 01:16:48,970
But he's a big fan of eating bear and
he's always telling people like,

1652
01:16:48,971 --> 01:16:50,590
you know,
like they're all good.

1653
01:16:50,650 --> 01:16:53,070
Like if you prepare correctly,
all bears good.

1654
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:54,670
Yeah.
Apparently the trick is to,

1655
01:16:54,671 --> 01:16:57,610
to get rid of the glands early on when
your field dressing.

1656
01:16:57,611 --> 01:17:00,300
Cause apparently that taints to meet and
that I've,

1657
01:17:00,301 --> 01:17:02,290
I've never feel dressed to bear,
so I don't know.

1658
01:17:02,470 --> 01:17:03,700
But,
um,

1659
01:17:03,790 --> 01:17:06,040
Steven Rinella though.
I love his cookbooks.

1660
01:17:06,730 --> 01:17:08,080
He's close to me.
He's up in,

1661
01:17:08,130 --> 01:17:10,310
um,
he's up in Bozeman.

1662
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:11,390
Yeah,
I think.

1663
01:17:11,390 --> 01:17:12,890
Yeah.
But I've been trying to get them to come

1664
01:17:12,891 --> 01:17:16,460
through spokane and swing into my house
to do a podcast cause I want to actually

1665
01:17:16,461 --> 01:17:19,160
ask them some questions about is if you
got a new cookbook.

1666
01:17:19,161 --> 01:17:19,881
Yeah,
yeah.

1667
01:17:19,881 --> 01:17:21,470
We've connected.
We've talked a few times.

1668
01:17:21,540 --> 01:17:22,910
I skype,
I just got to get them to come through

1669
01:17:22,911 --> 01:17:23,920
spokane.
I love that guy.

1670
01:17:24,110 --> 01:17:25,780
Yeah.
He's the one who got me into hunting.

1671
01:17:25,900 --> 01:17:27,020
Yeah.
Yeah.

1672
01:17:27,110 --> 01:17:28,170
That's fun though.
Yeah,

1673
01:17:28,460 --> 01:17:30,590
it's a great cook too.
He really is.

1674
01:17:30,591 --> 01:17:35,591
He really understands like so many
different preparations and tries to get

1675
01:17:36,081 --> 01:17:39,200
people to try things like Osso Buco you
know the braise,

1676
01:17:39,201 --> 01:17:41,120
the shanks and yeah.
Yeah,

1677
01:17:41,260 --> 01:17:41,951
yeah.
I love that.

1678
01:17:41,951 --> 01:17:44,260
And how about spear fishing?
Have you gotten into into little spear

1679
01:17:44,261 --> 01:17:45,890
phishing and free diving?
Seen it all.

1680
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:49,640
I was in Hawaii recently.
My youngest daughter is obsessed with

1681
01:17:49,641 --> 01:17:50,090
fishing.

1682
01:17:50,090 --> 01:17:51,960
She fucking loves it.
And uh,

1683
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:55,820
we caught a bunch of yellow tail when we
were in Hawaii this last trip and now

1684
01:17:55,821 --> 01:17:59,600
she's super hooked cause you know,
she's eight and she's hanging onto this

1685
01:17:59,601 --> 01:18:02,410
rod and you know,
I mean I was at,

1686
01:18:02,411 --> 01:18:05,510
sometimes I was helping her.
Like I was holding the Rod and she was

1687
01:18:05,511 --> 01:18:07,970
with her two little arms crank in these
yellow tails.

1688
01:18:07,971 --> 01:18:09,890
And you know,
you catch a 10 pound yellow tail when

1689
01:18:09,891 --> 01:18:13,190
you're eight years old and the fucking,
that's a whole side thing.

1690
01:18:13,220 --> 01:18:14,750
Oh my God,
they're so powerful.

1691
01:18:14,751 --> 01:18:18,290
It's a fight.
I took my boys out for steelhead and my

1692
01:18:18,291 --> 01:18:19,130
boy,
my boy,

1693
01:18:19,131 --> 01:18:20,750
a tearing,
he almost got pulled into the water on

1694
01:18:20,751 --> 01:18:23,450
north fork of the clearwater big steel
head.

1695
01:18:23,451 --> 01:18:26,180
I mean those things are massive.
Snagged.

1696
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:28,250
One's not supposed to eat them.
Right?

1697
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:29,210
He's supposed to let them go.

1698
01:18:29,210 --> 01:18:31,100
It depends there.
There's a certain,

1699
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:35,240
I forget that I forget the color,
but there's a certain style of steelhead

1700
01:18:35,241 --> 01:18:37,220
that you are allowed to.
He had to throw this one back.

1701
01:18:37,221 --> 01:18:38,810
This wasn't the one,
one of the ones that we were yelling to

1702
01:18:38,811 --> 01:18:41,090
eat.
Don't totally understand that.

1703
01:18:41,330 --> 01:18:42,800
I mean,
I kind of understand it,

1704
01:18:42,801 --> 01:18:46,220
but it seems to me like it is,
it's an ocean bound rainbow trout,

1705
01:18:46,340 --> 01:18:47,090
correct.
Yeah,

1706
01:18:47,090 --> 01:18:48,770
exactly.
So why can't you eat it?

1707
01:18:48,860 --> 01:18:50,810
I Dunno.
I Dunno man.

1708
01:18:50,811 --> 01:18:52,250
And there's,
there's a certain variety that you

1709
01:18:52,251 --> 01:18:53,870
actually can't eat.
Well,

1710
01:18:53,871 --> 01:18:56,270
you,
you can eat it physically,

1711
01:18:56,420 --> 01:18:57,280
but you're now,
I mean,

1712
01:18:57,740 --> 01:18:59,090
I mean legally.
Yeah,

1713
01:18:59,590 --> 01:19:03,710
that seems so strange to me is the idea
to protect the population because

1714
01:19:03,711 --> 01:19:06,170
they're in the process of breeding and
you don't want to interrupt,

1715
01:19:06,171 --> 01:19:08,900
but you're off.
There's a certain mortality rate that

1716
01:19:08,901 --> 01:19:10,460
they're accepting with catch and
release.

1717
01:19:10,460 --> 01:19:13,280
This is one of the reasons why I have an
issue with that and I've done catch and

1718
01:19:13,281 --> 01:19:15,140
release fishing.
I don't want to appear like I'm a

1719
01:19:15,141 --> 01:19:18,620
hypocrite because it is fun,
but there's a thing about it is like

1720
01:19:18,650 --> 01:19:22,330
you're just shoving a hook and the
things face and then releasing them.

1721
01:19:22,610 --> 01:19:26,930
That is why I like spear fishing because
you're underwater.

1722
01:19:27,410 --> 01:19:29,750
You're going after the exact fish that
you want.

1723
01:19:30,110 --> 01:19:33,160
There's no doubt in your mind I'm going
to shoot that fish and it,

1724
01:19:33,161 --> 01:19:34,520
you know,
you're not wondering what's going to

1725
01:19:34,521 --> 01:19:35,670
bite the hook,
right?

1726
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:38,900
Like whether it's going to be illegal
one or an illegal one,

1727
01:19:40,010 --> 01:19:43,160
regardless of whether you get a fish.
It's amazing.

1728
01:19:43,220 --> 01:19:45,380
You're happy.
You see the coral,

1729
01:19:45,620 --> 01:19:46,341
you're getting it.
Yeah.

1730
01:19:46,341 --> 01:19:47,840
You're going down and up.
There's the,

1731
01:19:47,841 --> 01:19:49,730
there's all like if you're in the
fitness,

1732
01:19:49,731 --> 01:19:53,480
the cold thermogenesis and the breath
hold and the spleen compression and the

1733
01:19:53,481 --> 01:19:55,310
red blood cell production.
So I mean it's a,

1734
01:19:55,311 --> 01:19:57,950
it's an amazing workout.
Um,

1735
01:19:58,130 --> 01:19:59,480
it's just fun.
It's Zen.

1736
01:19:59,510 --> 01:20:00,920
Yeah.
They wouldn't let my daughter do it

1737
01:20:00,921 --> 01:20:01,790
though.
She's too young.

1738
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:04,610
They said you have to be 13 so just a
spear fish.

1739
01:20:04,620 --> 01:20:06,980
Yeah.
She could probably be like shallow water

1740
01:20:06,990 --> 01:20:08,010
with a slang and

1741
01:20:08,430 --> 01:20:10,500
that's,
that's the way to do it is you want to

1742
01:20:10,501 --> 01:20:13,830
start off shore eight to 15 feet of
water.

1743
01:20:13,860 --> 01:20:15,830
You want to easy slang.
You know,

1744
01:20:15,831 --> 01:20:19,740
a lot of people think spear and they
think of like the big roller guns that

1745
01:20:19,741 --> 01:20:23,070
you gotta like put the handle against
your chest and pull back.

1746
01:20:23,430 --> 01:20:26,550
It's very difficult.
And then you got to dive to depths,

1747
01:20:26,551 --> 01:20:26,941
you know,
for,

1748
01:20:26,941 --> 01:20:30,240
if you're going after tonight,
you gotta be able to go like 30 plus

1749
01:20:30,241 --> 01:20:33,390
feet and you have a floater and it's a
very involved process.

1750
01:20:33,391 --> 01:20:37,650
But if you're just like in fricking
Hawaii and you've got a sling and a good

1751
01:20:37,651 --> 01:20:42,480
spot and some coral and some good fans
and you can just basically swim away.

1752
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:46,260
Um,
I'll tie a string around my waist and

1753
01:20:46,290 --> 01:20:49,060
pull a knife on my belt and he can just
go out there and you know,

1754
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:51,360
string four or five fish and it's an
easy day.

1755
01:20:51,510 --> 01:20:52,810
It's a ton of fun.
Yeah.

1756
01:20:52,811 --> 01:20:55,140
And it's almost like,
it's not fishing.

1757
01:20:55,170 --> 01:20:57,720
He'd called Spear Phishing,
but you basically hunting underwater,

1758
01:20:57,721 --> 01:20:59,730
hunting underwater.
They even have the,

1759
01:20:59,731 --> 01:21:01,620
I haven't done this yet,
but maybe you've seen these,

1760
01:21:01,621 --> 01:21:03,810
these underwater bows.
You can,

1761
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:05,630
you can shoot a bow at the fish.
Yeah.

1762
01:21:05,670 --> 01:21:07,920
Had a bow.
I don't know if they called bow fishing

1763
01:21:07,921 --> 01:21:09,120
or what.
Have you seen this?

1764
01:21:09,450 --> 01:21:11,150
I've seen something like it.
Yeah,

1765
01:21:11,170 --> 01:21:11,440
I'm,
well,

1766
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:14,580
I know there's a lot of both fish and
the people do the shooting down at

1767
01:21:14,650 --> 01:21:17,370
Phillip and alligator Gar in particular.
That's a big one.

1768
01:21:17,390 --> 01:21:19,710
They use it as well.
No,

1769
01:21:19,770 --> 01:21:21,930
it's supposed to be really good.
Smoked rarely.

1770
01:21:21,931 --> 01:21:25,050
It's a such a weird looking animal.
It's almost seems like in my mind it

1771
01:21:25,051 --> 01:21:27,540
almost feels like it shouldn't shoot it
cause it's a dinosaur.

1772
01:21:28,130 --> 01:21:32,190
Keep it alive because they really
haven't changed in millions of years.

1773
01:21:32,430 --> 01:21:33,830
Uh,
such a freaky look.

1774
01:21:33,831 --> 01:21:36,720
They're fun to prepare though.
Do a fish feed after spearfish or all

1775
01:21:36,721 --> 01:21:37,920
cold?
You're hungry.

1776
01:21:37,950 --> 01:21:39,360
Last one I did a,
we had,

1777
01:21:39,390 --> 01:21:44,040
we had a pair of fish down Hawaii
stuffed with avocado and mango coconut

1778
01:21:44,070 --> 01:21:47,010
oil paint baked in the oven with
Macadamia nut.

1779
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:50,400
Like in cross the Macadamia nut parrot
fish are the ones that are eating the

1780
01:21:50,401 --> 01:21:54,030
coral and shitting out white sand.
I don't know.

1781
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:55,650
Yeah.
Did you know that you've watched more

1782
01:21:55,651 --> 01:21:58,320
nature tv than I have.
That's what white sand is.

1783
01:21:58,340 --> 01:22:00,090
It's shit.
Really?

1784
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:01,200
Yeah.
Believe it or not.

1785
01:22:01,230 --> 01:22:02,190
It's like these,
yeah.

1786
01:22:02,191 --> 01:22:06,040
These fish eat coral chew it up and shit
out the white sand.

1787
01:22:06,060 --> 01:22:08,760
So like a giant white sand beach like
clearwater,

1788
01:22:08,761 --> 01:22:11,070
Florida.
That's all fish parrot.

1789
01:22:11,071 --> 01:22:13,680
Fish poop makes beautiful beaches.
There you go.

1790
01:22:13,681 --> 01:22:14,760
There's the article.
The answer.

1791
01:22:14,761 --> 01:22:16,830
I wonder if it's good for your,
I wonder if it's good for your

1792
01:22:16,831 --> 01:22:19,260
microbiome out on bacteria.

1793
01:22:19,290 --> 01:22:21,540
These motherfuckers are out there just
eating rocks.

1794
01:22:21,900 --> 01:22:23,490
That's a lot of shit.
It's a lot.

1795
01:22:23,491 --> 01:22:26,070
It's a lot of pair of fish over a very
long period of time.

1796
01:22:26,100 --> 01:22:27,590
Millions.
You can go on a ship,

1797
01:22:28,050 --> 01:22:29,190
like here you go,
you can see them,

1798
01:22:29,580 --> 01:22:31,890
they're chewing on the coral.
They Bang it out.

1799
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:34,980
They have like a beak essentially.
That's why they're calling parrot fish.

1800
01:22:35,430 --> 01:22:38,940
They smashed down that coral and then
all that white around them is,

1801
01:22:38,941 --> 01:22:41,190
they're just basically swimming around
their own shit.

1802
01:22:41,790 --> 01:22:43,110
That's pretty cool.
Crazy.

1803
01:22:43,140 --> 01:22:45,170
That's pretty cool.
Very strange like that.

1804
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:46,560
Yeah.
Um,

1805
01:22:47,430 --> 01:22:49,440
I was going to ask you something,
um,

1806
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,170
metformin you started talking about with
David.

1807
01:22:52,230 --> 01:22:53,070
Yes.
David Sinclair.

1808
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:54,240
He can take that.
Yes.

1809
01:22:54,241 --> 01:22:55,980
And the foreman maybe,
I don't know.

1810
01:22:55,981 --> 01:22:57,540
It seems weird because that one's a
drug.

1811
01:22:57,680 --> 01:23:00,150
It's like,
it's like the darling of the antiaging

1812
01:23:00,260 --> 01:23:01,160
industry,
you know,

1813
01:23:01,170 --> 01:23:04,530
it's like a nickel a pop and it's,
it's uh,

1814
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:08,710
inhibits m talk to a certain extent,
but the big deal with that is his

1815
01:23:08,711 --> 01:23:11,770
glycaemic variability,
reduced risk of chronic disease.

1816
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:13,840
But there's a lot of side effects of
that.

1817
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:16,750
I want to mention that to you saying
that there's none.

1818
01:23:16,780 --> 01:23:19,810
No,
there's lactic acidosis and it inhibits

1819
01:23:19,811 --> 01:23:21,460
the,
the um,

1820
01:23:21,490 --> 01:23:23,470
electron transport chain in the
Mitochondria,

1821
01:23:23,471 --> 01:23:26,550
which is fine if you want to down
regulate metabolism live a long time and

1822
01:23:26,551 --> 01:23:28,670
not if you not if you're an athlete,
right?

1823
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:32,140
You don't want to inhibit mitochondrial
respiration necessarily.

1824
01:23:32,620 --> 01:23:35,920
Um,
vitamin B 12 deficiencies like it's

1825
01:23:35,921 --> 01:23:39,850
derived from French [inaudible] and
physicians for for hundreds of years

1826
01:23:39,851 --> 01:23:42,520
been using it but in limited quantities
because it induces nausea,

1827
01:23:43,070 --> 01:23:44,500
right?
He'd say get gastrointestinal

1828
01:23:44,501 --> 01:23:46,390
disturbances.
Um,

1829
01:23:47,020 --> 01:23:49,760
my take on metformin cause,
cause I,

1830
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:53,290
I've been looking over the past year and
to a lot of these anti aging compounds

1831
01:23:53,291 --> 01:23:58,060
that people are now using or talking
about using like wrap a myosin and

1832
01:23:58,061 --> 01:24:03,061
metformin and Nad and a lot of these
sirtuin precursors but metformin and

1833
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:06,940
rapamycin actually for,
for different reasons because that's an

1834
01:24:06,941 --> 01:24:11,941
immune system suppressor are two that I
don't think I would ever take really.

1835
01:24:11,950 --> 01:24:16,950
Cause with metformin there are a variety
of natural compounds that reduce blood

1836
01:24:17,501 --> 01:24:22,150
glucose and improve insulin sensitivity.
In the absence of that,

1837
01:24:22,510 --> 01:24:25,120
like Berberine,
a curcumin,

1838
01:24:25,480 --> 01:24:29,350
apple cider vinegar,
sail on cinnamon bitter melon extract,

1839
01:24:29,410 --> 01:24:32,620
and you think all those things are
mimicking what metformin is capable of

1840
01:24:32,621 --> 01:24:33,700
doing?
I think so.

1841
01:24:33,730 --> 01:24:34,990
Um,
I'm not wearing it right now,

1842
01:24:34,991 --> 01:24:39,010
but usually I wear a Dexcom g six.
It's a continuous blood glucose monitor.

1843
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:41,890
It actually fell off yesterday when I
was doing that exercise.

1844
01:24:41,891 --> 01:24:45,370
That's one of those ones who see a
diabetics where there was still sends my

1845
01:24:45,371 --> 01:24:48,490
blood glucose to myself on all sorts of
interesting things like,

1846
01:24:48,491 --> 01:24:51,310
um,
my blood glucose would spike in the

1847
01:24:51,311 --> 01:24:54,370
mornings like clockwork,
about 8:00 AM every morning.

1848
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:57,040
And I was trying to figure out like,
why is my blood glucose going to one

1849
01:24:57,041 --> 01:24:59,410
2130 every single morning?
Well,

1850
01:24:59,860 --> 01:25:03,160
I'd have a cup of coffee in the morning
and even though I don't put cream or

1851
01:25:03,161 --> 01:25:04,750
sugar in my coffee,
I just drink straight up.

1852
01:25:04,750 --> 01:25:07,660
Black coffee.
Coffee actually causes your liver to

1853
01:25:07,661 --> 01:25:09,730
engage in something called
glycogenolysis.

1854
01:25:09,731 --> 01:25:12,190
So you actually release glucose into the
bloodstream,

1855
01:25:12,280 --> 01:25:14,170
which is a good thing.
And it's why you drink coffee.

1856
01:25:14,350 --> 01:25:16,870
You want that Cortisol release,
that glucose hit.

1857
01:25:17,080 --> 01:25:18,280
You know,
maybe you want the flavor and the

1858
01:25:18,281 --> 01:25:21,100
antioxidants too.
But I would get a blood glucose response

1859
01:25:21,101 --> 01:25:22,230
from coffee.
Uh,

1860
01:25:22,390 --> 01:25:24,880
another one that surprised me was green
beans.

1861
01:25:25,290 --> 01:25:26,680
Uh,
talk about legumes.

1862
01:25:26,681 --> 01:25:29,410
You talk about slow release
carbohydrates and it falls into that

1863
01:25:29,411 --> 01:25:32,020
category.
But my blood glucose would go up

1864
01:25:32,110 --> 01:25:35,980
whenever I'd have green beans.
So I actually got a food allergy tests

1865
01:25:35,981 --> 01:25:39,160
through this company called Cyrex.
They did like a really good food allergy

1866
01:25:39,161 --> 01:25:43,300
test that doesn't give you this big
laundry list of false positives like uh,

1867
01:25:43,330 --> 01:25:45,610
like uh,
there's like the Elisa and the owl cat

1868
01:25:45,611 --> 01:25:47,080
test.
Like the skin prick tests,

1869
01:25:47,290 --> 01:25:50,530
you just get like a very small number of
foods that you're actually allergic to.

1870
01:25:50,910 --> 01:25:53,380
Cause a lot of these other tests,
they'll show a bunch of antibodies to

1871
01:25:53,381 --> 01:25:55,420
food,
but it's antibodies to foods.

1872
01:25:55,430 --> 01:25:57,940
You're eating that food are so,
so many people would be like,

1873
01:25:57,980 --> 01:25:58,750
dude,
them,

1874
01:25:58,750 --> 01:26:01,630
I'm allergic to eggs.
I got a test on allergic to eggs and I'm

1875
01:26:01,631 --> 01:26:03,440
depressed because that was a big staple
in my diet.

1876
01:26:03,830 --> 01:26:05,210
Well,
it's only showing that you're allergic

1877
01:26:05,211 --> 01:26:08,150
to them cause they were a staple in your
diet because you're eating a lot of eggs

1878
01:26:08,180 --> 01:26:11,780
and you're winding up with a lot of
those egg proteins in your bloodstream.

1879
01:26:12,260 --> 01:26:13,071
But this,
this,

1880
01:26:13,071 --> 01:26:14,150
uh,
cyrex panel.

1881
01:26:14,930 --> 01:26:18,230
So basically if,
if you're eating a lot of eggs,

1882
01:26:18,260 --> 01:26:22,670
you actually have a lot of egg proteins
circulating in your bloodstream.

1883
01:26:22,970 --> 01:26:25,250
And if,
if you get a food panel,

1884
01:26:25,340 --> 01:26:28,640
you actually can very readily produce it
like a food allergy panel.

1885
01:26:28,641 --> 01:26:32,840
You produce antibodies to the egg
protein and they say that you're

1886
01:26:32,841 --> 01:26:36,440
allergic to the egg protein when in fact
you just have a lot of egg proteins in

1887
01:26:36,441 --> 01:26:38,300
your system because you've been eating a
lot of eggs.

1888
01:26:38,750 --> 01:26:43,160
And sometimes they'll even test the
white blood cell reaction to a raw egg,

1889
01:26:43,340 --> 01:26:44,750
not a cooked egg.
Right.

1890
01:26:44,751 --> 01:26:48,680
And so your white blood cells are going
to react more readily to a raw egg

1891
01:26:48,710 --> 01:26:51,140
versus cook dagger raw chicken versus
Cook Chicken.

1892
01:26:51,141 --> 01:26:53,780
I don't think a lot of these food
allergy panels were that accurate for

1893
01:26:53,781 --> 01:26:54,830
that reason.
Like,

1894
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:58,220
I think they're just giving you a
laundry list of foods that you may or

1895
01:26:58,221 --> 01:27:01,160
may not be allergic to,
but this one is called,

1896
01:27:01,161 --> 01:27:02,190
it's called Cyrex.
I've,

1897
01:27:02,260 --> 01:27:05,120
I have no financial affiliation and
they're like that with his company but I

1898
01:27:05,121 --> 01:27:06,890
just think they do a good job with their
testing.

1899
01:27:07,250 --> 01:27:10,160
They uh,
you got to order through a physician and

1900
01:27:10,161 --> 01:27:14,330
I ordered this test and I was allergic
to almost nothing like barely anything

1901
01:27:14,331 --> 01:27:16,970
would spike for me.
Like kind of like a moderate spike for

1902
01:27:16,971 --> 01:27:18,320
gluten,
uh,

1903
01:27:18,380 --> 01:27:23,380
green beans l were off the chart off the
chart so that continuous blood glucose

1904
01:27:23,961 --> 01:27:28,910
monitor was actually able to tell me
that I was eating something that my

1905
01:27:28,911 --> 01:27:31,160
sympathetic nervous system was
responding to.

1906
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:35,360
I was going to fight and flight mode,
releasing a bunch of glucose and I never

1907
01:27:35,361 --> 01:27:38,480
would have really known that or gotten a
clue about that unless I was wearing one

1908
01:27:38,481 --> 01:27:40,400
of these continuous blood glucose
monitors.

1909
01:27:40,850 --> 01:27:42,710
I'm not going to wear my whole life,
but I'm going to wear it.

1910
01:27:42,740 --> 01:27:45,440
My,
my plan is to wear for a year to just

1911
01:27:45,441 --> 01:27:47,840
learn a lot about the foods that I
usually eat,

1912
01:27:48,050 --> 01:27:50,750
what they do to my body,
what certain workouts do,

1913
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:52,580
uh,
what certain supplements do.

1914
01:27:53,270 --> 01:27:56,660
But returning to Metformin,
I started to use a lot of these things

1915
01:27:56,661 --> 01:27:58,330
like bear Brene,
like curcumin.

1916
01:27:58,370 --> 01:28:01,160
You can do a shot of apple cider vinegar
before a meal,

1917
01:28:01,340 --> 01:28:04,160
take a couple of teaspoons of sale on
cinnamon in your smoothie.

1918
01:28:04,370 --> 01:28:08,750
And these things actually have an effect
on blood glucose that mimics what you're

1919
01:28:08,751 --> 01:28:10,700
trying to get when you take metformin.

1920
01:28:10,840 --> 01:28:14,580
That but without the side effects is
just limiting blood glucose.

1921
01:28:14,581 --> 01:28:15,620
Well,
like I mentioned earlier,

1922
01:28:15,621 --> 01:28:17,960
it does inhibit mtor low bed,
right?

1923
01:28:17,990 --> 01:28:19,010
So,
so you get that,

1924
01:28:19,011 --> 01:28:21,710
that mtor inhibition,
but you can inhibit mtor tore through

1925
01:28:21,711 --> 01:28:25,070
like calorie restriction and fasting
done regularly or like a compressed

1926
01:28:25,071 --> 01:28:27,350
feeding window should add you here
yesterday.

1927
01:28:27,560 --> 01:28:28,091
Yes,
there's,

1928
01:28:28,091 --> 01:28:28,790
there's,
Oh,

1929
01:28:28,790 --> 01:28:30,770
I should have had you here to talk to
Davidson.

1930
01:28:31,210 --> 01:28:33,470
I want to finish listening to that
interview too because he,

1931
01:28:33,471 --> 01:28:35,060
he's a,
he's a very smart guy,

1932
01:28:35,510 --> 01:28:38,990
but I just,
I'm not enamored with metformin.

1933
01:28:39,150 --> 01:28:40,050
Well,
he's not an APP.

1934
01:28:40,160 --> 01:28:42,080
Better,
more natural alternatives.

1935
01:28:42,110 --> 01:28:44,660
He's not an athlete.
He barely works out and a lot of side,

1936
01:28:44,661 --> 01:28:46,370
a little bit.
It does like a little bit of a run,

1937
01:28:46,371 --> 01:28:48,350
a little bit of lifting.
But you could tell he's not,

1938
01:28:48,351 --> 01:28:52,310
he's not a guy who's really exerting
himself rigorously.

1939
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:55,610
To me,
I want the marriage of performance and

1940
01:28:55,611 --> 01:28:57,980
longevity.
I don't want to live a long time.

1941
01:28:57,981 --> 01:28:59,900
If I can't kick ass,
I feel good.

1942
01:28:59,901 --> 01:29:03,390
I don't want to be cold and,
and Libido lists and left home 150 like

1943
01:29:03,620 --> 01:29:05,220
I want to,
even if that means I'm going to live

1944
01:29:05,221 --> 01:29:09,420
till I'm 145 instead of 150 right.
Cause Cause I've got more muscle mass or

1945
01:29:09,421 --> 01:29:10,920
whatever.
Like I want to feel good.

1946
01:29:11,250 --> 01:29:13,770
So whenever I'm looking at a compound
like that,

1947
01:29:13,890 --> 01:29:18,890
I'm questioning whether or not it's,
it's the best way to go if it's going to

1948
01:29:19,411 --> 01:29:21,500
inhibit my actual performance.
Right.

1949
01:29:21,510 --> 01:29:23,490
His focus.
There's natural alternatives.

1950
01:29:23,640 --> 01:29:25,570
He's so focused on longevity.
Yeah.

1951
01:29:25,930 --> 01:29:27,840
But you could say that about a lot of
these things.

1952
01:29:27,900 --> 01:29:29,640
I mean like,
like cryotherapy,

1953
01:29:29,641 --> 01:29:30,990
chambers,
right.

1954
01:29:31,050 --> 01:29:33,360
I mean,
you look at the Cherokee,

1955
01:29:33,361 --> 01:29:37,680
native American tribe would dip their
babies and icy cold water to La were

1956
01:29:37,681 --> 01:29:41,100
like two years old or the uh,
there's the,

1957
01:29:41,130 --> 01:29:44,220
the viral video footage of the Siberian
school children.

1958
01:29:44,220 --> 01:29:45,420
I don't know if you've seen this one.
They,

1959
01:29:45,660 --> 01:29:48,600
they rush out into the snow during
recess and their underpants and they

1960
01:29:48,601 --> 01:29:51,390
dump cold water on themselves and run
around in the snow and then come back

1961
01:29:51,391 --> 01:29:56,391
inside and in Iceland based on some of
the research that was done a few decades

1962
01:29:57,030 --> 01:29:59,790
ago on immune system,
they let their babies sleep outside and

1963
01:29:59,791 --> 01:30:02,970
like subzero temperatures in strollers.
Yeah,

1964
01:30:04,510 --> 01:30:05,730
the Russians,
the finish,

1965
01:30:05,731 --> 01:30:08,350
the eastern European and they've all got
their,

1966
01:30:08,351 --> 01:30:10,350
their cryotherapy,
like the Baltic Sea,

1967
01:30:10,351 --> 01:30:11,700
you know,
you go back and forth and I go to

1968
01:30:11,701 --> 01:30:14,340
Finland,
they've got the men's Finnish Sauna

1969
01:30:14,340 --> 01:30:15,750
Society,
there's no crowd there be chambers and

1970
01:30:15,751 --> 01:30:19,110
it was just old school saunas.
And then you go jump in the sea and you

1971
01:30:19,111 --> 01:30:21,360
dry yourself off in the air that you go
back in the sauna.

1972
01:30:21,930 --> 01:30:26,930
So a lot of these things,
there's natural turnitin Jz and I get

1973
01:30:28,381 --> 01:30:32,340
flack a lot of the time cause I'm,
you know I'm one of these so called bio

1974
01:30:32,341 --> 01:30:33,210
hackers,
right?

1975
01:30:33,230 --> 01:30:36,600
I have like the,
the laser lights in my office that I

1976
01:30:36,601 --> 01:30:41,400
shine on my balls and I've got like the,
you know the lights that go in your ears

1977
01:30:41,401 --> 01:30:42,540
and I've got,
you know,

1978
01:30:42,541 --> 01:30:45,600
the the stem cells and Ivs and
injections.

1979
01:30:45,601 --> 01:30:50,220
But I always,
always want to make sure people know

1980
01:30:50,221 --> 01:30:52,350
that you go after the natural stuff
first.

1981
01:30:52,700 --> 01:30:55,590
But like natural ways to get cold,
natural ways to get hot.

1982
01:30:55,890 --> 01:30:59,160
If you're going to buy some expensive
pulsed electromagnetic field,

1983
01:30:59,161 --> 01:31:02,580
Matt,
you sure as hell better be going outside

1984
01:31:02,581 --> 01:31:03,480
barefoot,
right?

1985
01:31:03,481 --> 01:31:07,020
Like or camping or sleeping outside or
learning how to earth and ground in a

1986
01:31:07,021 --> 01:31:10,920
more natural way.
What is involved in earthing and

1987
01:31:10,921 --> 01:31:13,430
grounding?
Is there a real pickle?

1988
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:16,950
There is research,
especially in terms of a reduction in

1989
01:31:16,951 --> 01:31:19,530
inflammation and improvement in joint
comfort.

1990
01:31:19,531 --> 01:31:22,890
That's a very interesting one.
And then when you take the same

1991
01:31:22,891 --> 01:31:26,520
frequency so that the earth naturally
emits somewhere in the range of about

1992
01:31:26,521 --> 01:31:30,480
three to a hundred hertz,
electromagnetic frequencies like way

1993
01:31:30,481 --> 01:31:31,314
lower than that.

1994
01:31:31,640 --> 01:31:33,120
You know,
million hertz frequencies are getting

1995
01:31:33,121 --> 01:31:34,500
when you're holding your cell phone up
to your ear.

1996
01:31:34,501 --> 01:31:37,440
But we're walking around on basically a
giant electrical matt,

1997
01:31:37,490 --> 01:31:38,760
like,
like there's radiation,

1998
01:31:38,761 --> 01:31:40,860
electromagnetic frequencies released by
Earth,

1999
01:31:41,310 --> 01:31:45,630
and the idea is that these fancy devices
now these mats that you could sleep on

2000
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:47,730
or do therapy on,
there's a,

2001
01:31:47,731 --> 01:31:50,040
there's been like,
I've got one in my basement that just

2002
01:31:50,041 --> 01:31:52,140
packs a punch,
like who was using the race horsing

2003
01:31:52,141 --> 01:31:55,560
industry for a long time.
It's called a pulse centers and you lay

2004
01:31:55,561 --> 01:31:59,350
on that thing and it just
vibrates your whole body.

2005
01:31:59,410 --> 01:32:00,243
What is it?
What is,

2006
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:03,460
it reduces inflammation and you think of
it like exercise for your cells.

2007
01:32:03,461 --> 01:32:05,110
It's opening and closing the cell
membrane.

2008
01:32:05,111 --> 01:32:08,320
So you're getting this blood flow.
It's called a poult centers.

2009
01:32:08,680 --> 01:32:11,980
It's like a giant table pulse center.
It's got different coils.

2010
01:32:11,981 --> 01:32:12,370
Yeah.

2011
01:32:12,370 --> 01:32:12,851
Yeah.
It's,

2012
01:32:12,851 --> 01:32:15,370
it's poults pulled centers is the name
of the company.

2013
01:32:15,371 --> 01:32:18,730
That makes sense.
Sirs or sense sense centers since the

2014
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:21,670
doors,
but it's got like a attachments like

2015
01:32:21,671 --> 01:32:25,420
coils and pads that you can attach to
your knee or attached to like a bum

2016
01:32:25,421 --> 01:32:28,180
shoulder or whatever.
I'll just sit in there and and work on

2017
01:32:28,181 --> 01:32:31,570
my computer.
I get a massage on it every week for a

2018
01:32:31,570 --> 01:32:33,910
couple of hours.
So it's taking the same frequencies you

2019
01:32:33,911 --> 01:32:35,650
get from the earth and just magnifying
those,

2020
01:32:35,651 --> 01:32:37,810
just delivering them in a more
concentrated manner.

2021
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:41,410
The same thing with like a like an
infrared light panel.

2022
01:32:41,470 --> 01:32:42,790
I don't know if you've seen these
before.

2023
01:32:42,791 --> 01:32:46,840
They deliver near infrared far infrared,
red light.

2024
01:32:46,900 --> 01:32:49,930
People will strip off their clothes and
stand in front of these things to get

2025
01:32:49,931 --> 01:32:54,370
more college in production or you know,
in the same way that that light that I

2026
01:32:54,371 --> 01:32:57,940
was talking about for your head can
enhance mitochondrial activity in neural

2027
01:32:57,941 --> 01:33:01,780
tissue or your,
your balls are basically little eyes.

2028
01:33:01,900 --> 01:33:04,060
They have photo receptors on them,
they respond to light.

2029
01:33:04,090 --> 01:33:07,480
You can actually increase mitochondrial
activity in the testicles,

2030
01:33:07,500 --> 01:33:10,570
in the Leydig cells,
in the testes to increased testosterone

2031
01:33:10,600 --> 01:33:13,210
or increased sperm production.
So you shoot a light in your balls and

2032
01:33:13,211 --> 01:33:14,620
all the ideas,
he grow more tests.

2033
01:33:14,621 --> 01:33:17,440
You'd go outside and you'd,
you'd sunbathing nude or you'd use one

2034
01:33:17,441 --> 01:33:18,570
of these lights and just standing for
it.

2035
01:33:18,571 --> 01:33:19,550
Like I literally,
I look,

2036
01:33:19,590 --> 01:33:21,730
look like an idiot at work,
but this is what I do.

2037
01:33:21,731 --> 01:33:25,390
I've got a light panel in front of me,
right?

2038
01:33:25,391 --> 01:33:27,520
I'm at a standing desk.
I worked at a standing desk.

2039
01:33:27,521 --> 01:33:31,270
I've got a light panel behind me and
every day for 20 minutes,

2040
01:33:31,390 --> 01:33:35,020
I just take my clothes off at work and I
stand sandwiched in between these light

2041
01:33:35,021 --> 01:33:38,770
panels and it basically blast me with
this red light.

2042
01:33:39,460 --> 01:33:41,590
But I also go out in the sun,
right?

2043
01:33:41,590 --> 01:33:44,440
Like I,
if I've got the option to do that versus

2044
01:33:44,500 --> 01:33:47,260
get outside in the sunlight,
I go out into the sunlight.

2045
01:33:47,261 --> 01:33:51,370
If I've got the option to take Berberine
and bitter melon extract instead of

2046
01:33:51,371 --> 01:33:53,560
Metformin,
I'd rather take the bear rain in the

2047
01:33:53,561 --> 01:33:57,040
bitter melon extract.
So I think he's just strips up down and

2048
01:33:57,041 --> 01:33:59,800
go as natural as possible.
And then once you step up to the more

2049
01:33:59,801 --> 01:34:00,730
advanced,
you know,

2050
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:04,360
anti aging strategies or bio hacking
strategies or what have you,

2051
01:34:04,630 --> 01:34:08,500
you still have to look at those with a
skeptical eye and ask yourself whether

2052
01:34:08,501 --> 01:34:10,960
or not those are,
those are really safe or if they have

2053
01:34:10,961 --> 01:34:12,410
side effects that might,
you know,

2054
01:34:12,411 --> 01:34:14,140
in many cases limit your physical
performance.

2055
01:34:14,170 --> 01:34:17,470
And why do you prefer the standing desk?
Well

2056
01:34:19,210 --> 01:34:21,100
the whole sitting is the new smoking
thing.

2057
01:34:21,130 --> 01:34:23,050
I disagree with,
I think,

2058
01:34:23,080 --> 01:34:24,250
I think sitting is just fine.

2059
01:34:24,460 --> 01:34:27,370
Like it feels natural to set,
it doesn't feel like you're breaking

2060
01:34:27,371 --> 01:34:30,550
some rule of the human body to sit down.
Like we're sitting down right now.

2061
01:34:30,551 --> 01:34:35,020
It feels pretty good.
The problem was sitting is that that is

2062
01:34:35,021 --> 01:34:37,780
the posture most people are adopting for
eight hours per day.

2063
01:34:38,020 --> 01:34:40,420
Right?
The best position to be in when you're

2064
01:34:40,421 --> 01:34:43,690
working would be whatever position
you're not in at the moment.

2065
01:34:43,750 --> 01:34:44,491
Same.
You know when,

2066
01:34:44,491 --> 01:34:48,340
when you look at weight training,
this would not apply to hypertrophy,

2067
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:51,760
which would dictate that you want to hit
a muscle over and over again using the

2068
01:34:51,761 --> 01:34:54,550
same angle with increasingly difficult
loads.

2069
01:34:54,790 --> 01:34:57,010
But for metabolic,
uh,

2070
01:34:57,170 --> 01:34:59,180
training,
you would want to actually throw curve

2071
01:34:59,181 --> 01:35:00,140
balls at your body,
right?

2072
01:35:00,141 --> 01:35:02,390
You had the best workout,
therefore would be the one that you're

2073
01:35:02,391 --> 01:35:06,110
not doing right now if your goal was,
was just to limit any type of metabolic

2074
01:35:06,111 --> 01:35:06,944
efficiency.

2075
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:11,450
So the idea with the standing desk is,
I have that to give me yet another

2076
01:35:11,451 --> 01:35:14,180
position to be in during the day.
So I've got to,

2077
01:35:14,181 --> 01:35:16,760
I've got a true form treadmill and I had
true form modify.

2078
01:35:16,761 --> 01:35:19,820
It's take the dashboard off.
So I've got that in front of my standing

2079
01:35:19,821 --> 01:35:24,020
workstation and then I've got one of
these balance boards that I can stand on

2080
01:35:24,140 --> 01:35:27,020
and I've got like a stool that I can
lean against.

2081
01:35:27,230 --> 01:35:30,620
So I've got all these different
positions that I can be in during the

2082
01:35:30,620 --> 01:35:31,431
day.
And then I've got that,

2083
01:35:31,431 --> 01:35:34,700
that a poult centers chair in my office
that I can go and sit in.

2084
01:35:35,030 --> 01:35:37,790
So every 25 minutes I'll just shift to a
different position.

2085
01:35:38,120 --> 01:35:41,480
And My standup desk is a hand crank
stand up desk so I can crank it up and

2086
01:35:41,481 --> 01:35:44,590
down.
If I do want to sit at my desk and just,

2087
01:35:44,630 --> 01:35:45,950
it just works,
you know,

2088
01:35:45,951 --> 01:35:46,784
it's,
it's,

2089
01:35:46,850 --> 01:35:49,040
it's the idea of hacking your
environment,

2090
01:35:49,041 --> 01:35:52,160
of equipping your environment to be in
as many different positions as possible.

2091
01:35:52,850 --> 01:35:54,980
So I think that's the key to feeling
good at work,

2092
01:35:55,190 --> 01:35:57,590
especially when you're stuck indoors.
Do you believe in one of those,

2093
01:35:57,600 --> 01:35:59,240
um,
you ever seen one of those?

2094
01:35:59,241 --> 01:36:00,270
Uh,
it's,

2095
01:36:00,271 --> 01:36:02,930
uh,
you stand at your standing desk on this

2096
01:36:03,110 --> 01:36:06,830
variable sort of surface.
Have you seen those things where it's

2097
01:36:06,831 --> 01:36:08,210
like,
it's topographical,

2098
01:36:08,220 --> 01:36:11,380
Matt as Matt?
I'll call it

2099
01:36:11,750 --> 01:36:14,950
ball.
The one like in our boulder offices from

2100
01:36:14,980 --> 01:36:18,440
my company,
we've got the standup desks that go up.

2101
01:36:18,490 --> 01:36:20,840
You,
you push a button and they go up and

2102
01:36:20,841 --> 01:36:23,090
down.
But then what we have is just scattered

2103
01:36:23,091 --> 01:36:24,950
around the office.
A few of those mats,

2104
01:36:24,980 --> 01:36:26,840
we've got some of the,
I don't know if you've seen these

2105
01:36:26,841 --> 01:36:28,010
fluids,
dance things.

2106
01:36:28,011 --> 01:36:31,010
They're like Kinda like skateboards that
you stand on top of,

2107
01:36:31,011 --> 01:36:33,880
but they're not,
they're not as gnarly as a balanced

2108
01:36:33,881 --> 01:36:35,820
board.
So you can still focus while you're

2109
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:38,180
standing on top of it.
Um,

2110
01:36:38,720 --> 01:36:40,310
you know,
we've got some different stools,

2111
01:36:40,311 --> 01:36:42,290
different chairs that will go up or
down.

2112
01:36:42,291 --> 01:36:45,290
So again,
even if you're in a corporate office,

2113
01:36:45,291 --> 01:36:46,910
I'd,
it surprises me how many people in

2114
01:36:46,911 --> 01:36:48,740
their,
in their corporate offices don't equip

2115
01:36:48,741 --> 01:36:51,410
their employees just to be able to,
to move during the day.

2116
01:36:51,470 --> 01:36:52,303
Yeah.

2117
01:36:52,380 --> 01:36:53,280
And they don't care.
Yeah.

2118
01:36:53,310 --> 01:36:55,140
Yeah.
And the most people aren't using

2119
01:36:55,141 --> 01:36:57,060
ergonomic chairs either.
Yeah.

2120
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:00,600
What do you use as your,
as your main chair for Ergonomic Chair,

2121
01:37:00,630 --> 01:37:02,040
these chairs that we ask when we're
sitting in,

2122
01:37:02,041 --> 01:37:03,540
right,
what am I sitting in right now?

2123
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:05,640
Pisco,
it's by a company feel like I'm not

2124
01:37:05,700 --> 01:37:09,960
using it to its full capacity.
What are the,

2125
01:37:10,230 --> 01:37:12,870
what's the purpose of the way that this
has shaped back of this?

2126
01:37:13,100 --> 01:37:16,920
Of Lean on it in a weird way.
Put your elbows on it if you like,

2127
01:37:16,921 --> 01:37:19,500
but it encourages you to have an upright
posture.

2128
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:21,780
I've got this thing called a Mogo
upright.

2129
01:37:21,810 --> 01:37:26,010
It's a stool and I can even travel with
it cause it will compress.

2130
01:37:26,011 --> 01:37:29,370
It weighs about two pounds and you can
actually lean against that and get into

2131
01:37:29,371 --> 01:37:32,970
some different positions on that one.
So is a company that sent us something.

2132
01:37:32,970 --> 01:37:37,110
They have one that's basically almost
like Sana spring where you kind of have

2133
01:37:37,111 --> 01:37:42,111
to balance yourself out.
You have to activate more just to be one

2134
01:37:43,380 --> 01:37:46,130
of those at a chiropractic event once
it's,

2135
01:37:46,160 --> 01:37:49,110
it's like kind of makes you squeeze your
pelvis while you're in the chair.

2136
01:37:49,320 --> 01:37:51,360
But there's actually,
there's this dude in Finland.

2137
01:37:51,690 --> 01:37:56,690
Um,
he's got a company called Sally s a l.

2138
01:37:57,691 --> 01:37:58,830
L.
I.

2139
01:37:58,830 --> 01:38:03,060
He used to ride horses and he decided to
start making chairs that would get him

2140
01:38:03,061 --> 01:38:05,130
into the same upright position that he'd
be.

2141
01:38:05,131 --> 01:38:07,270
And we have riding a horse.
Yeah,

2142
01:38:07,290 --> 01:38:09,240
it's a saddle chair.
Yeah.

2143
01:38:09,690 --> 01:38:12,450
I have one of those two that revs up my
kitchen table.

2144
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:14,010
That's shit.
It's still uncomfortable though.

2145
01:38:14,280 --> 01:38:15,390
Yeah.
Really?

2146
01:38:15,420 --> 01:38:17,190
Yeah.
It feels like your balls are sandwiched

2147
01:38:17,191 --> 01:38:20,820
in between these two planks.
I think the arm rods so you can spend

2148
01:38:20,821 --> 01:38:23,670
around if you want to sit like ac slater
style at the,

2149
01:38:23,671 --> 01:38:28,020
like he's what's Ac slider style chair
backwards.

2150
01:38:28,080 --> 01:38:30,400
Oh really?
That's AC slater in my head.

2151
01:38:30,430 --> 01:38:33,200
That isn't those saddle chairs.
They've,

2152
01:38:33,380 --> 01:38:35,790
they've got like Little Allen keys that
come with them.

2153
01:38:35,791 --> 01:38:38,550
And you can adjust to to your pelvic
width?

2154
01:38:38,730 --> 01:38:40,020
No,
it mean it fits my width.

2155
01:38:40,021 --> 01:38:40,950
It's just weird.
These,

2156
01:38:40,980 --> 01:38:42,510
the,
all those sorts of injections you've

2157
01:38:42,511 --> 01:38:45,120
been doing.
Just give her big ass wide pelvis.

2158
01:38:45,690 --> 01:38:49,520
Don't say on your chair.
That was my main chair for a long time

2159
01:38:49,521 --> 01:38:51,420
but saddled to it.
But then when I started using these

2160
01:38:51,421 --> 01:38:53,160
capisce co chairs,
it's way more comfortable.

2161
01:38:53,470 --> 01:38:55,550
Well if you're sitting for a long time.
Yes.

2162
01:38:55,580 --> 01:38:56,350
Yeah,
yeah.

2163
01:38:56,350 --> 01:38:59,460
And it's just,
it's easy and I have no back pain when I

2164
01:38:59,461 --> 01:39:02,430
use a regular office chair and I sit for
long periods of time,

2165
01:39:02,700 --> 01:39:06,270
I get that center back pain from just
just poor posture,

2166
01:39:06,271 --> 01:39:09,870
just sitting in a curved stance or a
curved up position.

2167
01:39:09,930 --> 01:39:12,180
What about a treadmill desk?
We tried one of those.

2168
01:39:13,400 --> 01:39:16,810
See I can't do a lot on treadmill desk
production wise,

2169
01:39:16,860 --> 01:39:19,290
but if I'm ever let,
if somebody is interviewing me like on

2170
01:39:19,291 --> 01:39:23,600
skype on a podcast while I'm doing a
consult call with somebody reviewing

2171
01:39:23,680 --> 01:39:27,690
blood work or something like that,
I'll be walking on my treadmill.

2172
01:39:27,900 --> 01:39:31,410
And then I've got my microphone in front
of me and I have this program called

2173
01:39:31,411 --> 01:39:36,411
dragon dictation and dragon dictation
allows me to talk via like a headset and

2174
01:39:37,321 --> 01:39:39,260
then it'll type the words on the screen.
You see?

2175
01:39:39,261 --> 01:39:42,420
Is that a long time ago?
But apparently the accurate leaps and

2176
01:39:42,421 --> 01:39:44,190
bounds.
Yeah,

2177
01:39:44,191 --> 01:39:46,680
it's called training your dragon.
You get the software tells you to train

2178
01:39:46,681 --> 01:39:49,080
your dragon.
And so you say all these words,

2179
01:39:49,081 --> 01:39:52,230
you read all these paragraphs and it
learns to identify your phrasing,

2180
01:39:52,640 --> 01:39:55,110
the volume of your voice,
and it gets more accurate.

2181
01:39:55,140 --> 01:39:57,410
But it's way better than,
than the Builtin Apple,

2182
01:39:57,680 --> 01:40:00,000
uh,
whatever's kind of voice recognition

2183
01:40:00,001 --> 01:40:01,800
software.
So it works.

2184
01:40:01,801 --> 01:40:03,960
And I liked that because then I can just
walk,

2185
01:40:04,020 --> 01:40:05,820
I can,
I can talk emails,

2186
01:40:05,821 --> 01:40:08,970
I can talk with people.
So there's like three or four different

2187
01:40:08,971 --> 01:40:11,700
things that I do at work that I will
walk doring yeah,

2188
01:40:11,970 --> 01:40:12,751
no,
that makes sense.

2189
01:40:12,751 --> 01:40:17,370
That makes sense.
I I write when I'm just completely alone

2190
01:40:17,371 --> 01:40:20,270
and quiet,
staring at a computer because uh,

2191
01:40:20,850 --> 01:40:25,710
I want to spend time on each individual
word and really concentrate on what the

2192
01:40:25,711 --> 01:40:29,940
fuck I'm saying cause it most of the
time I'm writing standup so I need to

2193
01:40:30,060 --> 01:40:32,310
bounce it back and forth and to talk it
out.

2194
01:40:32,311 --> 01:40:34,410
It's not really the right strategy.
Yeah.

2195
01:40:34,740 --> 01:40:35,640
Yeah.
I,

2196
01:40:36,450 --> 01:40:40,680
I'm working on a book right now and what
I've found is for me,

2197
01:40:40,681 --> 01:40:44,880
I have to have a triggered environment,
like a place in my house that when I go

2198
01:40:44,881 --> 01:40:48,600
to that place,
that's the place where your mind says,

2199
01:40:48,601 --> 01:40:50,890
okay this is the riding spot for me.
It,

2200
01:40:50,900 --> 01:40:53,890
it's,
it's this chair in the corner of the

2201
01:40:53,891 --> 01:40:54,130
living

2202
01:40:54,130 --> 01:40:56,800
room outside my office.
As soon as I get into that thing,

2203
01:40:57,140 --> 01:40:58,450
it's like writing mode.
Right,

2204
01:40:58,460 --> 01:40:59,380
right.
And I just,

2205
01:40:59,470 --> 01:41:01,750
I just go Pomodoro,
I'll ride for 25 minutes,

2206
01:41:01,780 --> 01:41:03,430
get up,
take a five minute break,

2207
01:41:03,460 --> 01:41:05,470
come back.
And then that's how I do it.

2208
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:09,460
Cause I just have an environment to
write in an environment and a good time,

2209
01:41:09,461 --> 01:41:11,680
like a specific time to write as good
too.

2210
01:41:11,681 --> 01:41:12,431
Like we,
you know,

2211
01:41:12,431 --> 01:41:13,960
hey,
now it's x amount,

2212
01:41:13,961 --> 01:41:14,980
you know,
it's x time.

2213
01:41:15,030 --> 01:41:15,731
That's,
that's when I,

2214
01:41:15,731 --> 01:41:16,650
right.
Yeah.

2215
01:41:16,680 --> 01:41:19,390
Yeah.
That's the idea behind 'em you'll haul

2216
01:41:19,400 --> 01:41:22,800
this new research they're doing on
Morning Nis eveningness uh,

2217
01:41:22,870 --> 01:41:27,870
chronotypes different people being night
owls versus morning larks even.

2218
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:29,110
Uh,
there,

2219
01:41:29,111 --> 01:41:30,220
there was,
um,

2220
01:41:30,450 --> 01:41:35,450
it was a study I was looking at
yesterday about the response to like an

2221
01:41:36,911 --> 01:41:39,550
inflammatory stress or I don't remember
what the stressor was,

2222
01:41:39,551 --> 01:41:42,850
but like when a morning type is stressed
out in the morning,

2223
01:41:42,851 --> 01:41:46,930
they handle it better than when they're
stressed out in the evening and vice

2224
01:41:46,931 --> 01:41:47,764
versa.

2225
01:41:47,880 --> 01:41:49,090
And is,
it's very interesting,

2226
01:41:49,091 --> 01:41:51,820
this research on chronotypes.
I like the idea of just,

2227
01:41:51,850 --> 01:41:55,840
just being able to shift your circadian
rhythm because I travel a lot.

2228
01:41:56,170 --> 01:41:59,440
Like I haven't been home at 17 days.
I've got two more days on the road and

2229
01:41:59,441 --> 01:42:00,700
then I'll be,
I'll be home.

2230
01:42:01,090 --> 01:42:03,490
But when I'm going east to west or west
to east,

2231
01:42:03,491 --> 01:42:08,491
I use light a lot to reset my circadian
biology and called a Zeit guiders.

2232
01:42:08,891 --> 01:42:09,730
Right.
Like these are,

2233
01:42:09,820 --> 01:42:13,420
these are cues that regulate your
circadian biology.

2234
01:42:13,720 --> 01:42:17,980
So like eating is one you want to wait
to eat until it's actual mealtime and

2235
01:42:17,981 --> 01:42:19,990
whatever area of the world that you're
traveling too.

2236
01:42:20,290 --> 01:42:24,900
So if you arrive in whatever you know,
New York City from California,

2237
01:42:24,930 --> 01:42:29,830
3:00 PM you don't want to eat a bite of
food until like 7:00 PM when it's actual

2238
01:42:29,831 --> 01:42:31,210
dinner.
Cause that helps to regulate your

2239
01:42:31,211 --> 01:42:32,080
circadian rhythm.

2240
01:42:32,410 --> 01:42:35,500
Movement is another one.
Like you want to get outside,

2241
01:42:35,501 --> 01:42:37,150
go for a walk,
go for a swim,

2242
01:42:37,180 --> 01:42:39,730
go hit the gym.
I found that that's a big one for me.

2243
01:42:39,970 --> 01:42:42,310
When I went to travel,
the first thing I'd do is I check in.

2244
01:42:42,311 --> 01:42:45,720
I go right to the gym.
I actually sat outside,

2245
01:42:45,750 --> 01:42:48,790
I take off my shoes and go outside.
That's good to be good for me.

2246
01:42:48,890 --> 01:42:52,150
Like a rigorous workout makes all the
difference in the world in terms of like

2247
01:42:52,151 --> 01:42:57,151
how I actually feel if I'm training,
if I'm traveling a lot and doing shows

2248
01:42:57,401 --> 01:42:59,090
and I go,
I mean you don't want to,

2249
01:42:59,091 --> 01:43:01,900
you get to a hotel room.
We just want to lay down and relax.

2250
01:43:02,020 --> 01:43:04,000
You have to defy that urge.
Yeah,

2251
01:43:04,030 --> 01:43:06,130
I'd just go straight to the gym.
That's what I find.

2252
01:43:06,131 --> 01:43:06,400
If he,
if,

2253
01:43:06,400 --> 01:43:09,640
if he shut up the inner bitch and make
it through the first two minutes,

2254
01:43:09,670 --> 01:43:10,503
you're good to go.

2255
01:43:10,750 --> 01:43:13,570
But light is the biggie.
Light is the biggie.

2256
01:43:13,720 --> 01:43:18,220
So I've got like the of God,
these buds that make light that go on my

2257
01:43:18,221 --> 01:43:20,470
ears.
You make light into your ear and you

2258
01:43:20,471 --> 01:43:22,380
have photo receptors in your ears,
right?

2259
01:43:22,450 --> 01:43:25,540
Photo receptors all over your body.
That's why if you wear a sleep mask to

2260
01:43:25,541 --> 01:43:27,550
go to bed,
you still have to make the room dark

2261
01:43:27,670 --> 01:43:29,500
cause you got photo receptors on your
skin.

2262
01:43:30,340 --> 01:43:33,370
I've got the one that I was talking
about that I wear on my head.

2263
01:43:33,810 --> 01:43:36,100
That one was called a,
that one's called a v Lie.

2264
01:43:36,250 --> 01:43:38,890
The one that goes in your ears is called
a human charger.

2265
01:43:39,160 --> 01:43:41,140
And then I've got the one that goes in
the eyes,

2266
01:43:41,540 --> 01:43:44,680
that one's called a re timer,
and that one makes like this greenish

2267
01:43:44,681 --> 01:43:47,590
blue light that's not damaging to your
retina,

2268
01:43:47,950 --> 01:43:50,740
but that just blast your entire skull
with light.

2269
01:43:50,930 --> 01:43:53,840
So I've got light on my eyes,
light on my ears,

2270
01:43:53,900 --> 01:43:58,250
and a lot of my head and I'll flip those
lights on back in front of the body and

2271
01:43:58,251 --> 01:44:01,690
that's my home set up to get my
circadian rhythm restore.

2272
01:44:01,691 --> 01:44:04,490
It's what I do is if I've been back east
right,

2273
01:44:04,580 --> 01:44:09,580
and my body at s 4:00 AM Pacific time is
telling me it's 7:00 AM because I'm on

2274
01:44:11,661 --> 01:44:14,030
eastern time.
My circadian clock is on eastern time.

2275
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:17,510
What I do is I wake up,
I'm not going to lay in bed for three

2276
01:44:17,511 --> 01:44:19,190
hours,
wait and wait until the time when I

2277
01:44:19,191 --> 01:44:21,650
actually do want to get up.
What I do is I wake up,

2278
01:44:21,651 --> 01:44:24,350
I get out of bed,
and I put on those blue light blocking

2279
01:44:24,351 --> 01:44:26,370
glasses.
The ones that you're supposed to wear at

2280
01:44:26,371 --> 01:44:27,590
night.
Right?

2281
01:44:27,620 --> 01:44:29,450
You know,
like the yellowish orange lenses,

2282
01:44:29,840 --> 01:44:30,980
but I block all light.

2283
01:44:31,100 --> 01:44:34,490
So I'm basically just walking around and
pretty dim setting in my house.

2284
01:44:34,491 --> 01:44:36,650
You know,
I'll make coffee sometimes or have some

2285
01:44:36,651 --> 01:44:37,700
water,
stretch out,

2286
01:44:37,701 --> 01:44:40,610
get some work done,
but I've got the light block the whole

2287
01:44:40,611 --> 01:44:44,210
time.
And then whenever the time rules around

2288
01:44:44,211 --> 01:44:46,570
when I actually want to start waking up,
right.

2289
01:44:46,580 --> 01:44:50,690
Let's say I'm like 6:00 AM I don't want
to wake up at 4:00 AM want wake up at

2290
01:44:50,691 --> 01:44:53,630
6:00 AM,
then I'll go down in my office and I'll

2291
01:44:53,631 --> 01:44:56,360
put on the,
I think the ear thing,

2292
01:44:56,600 --> 01:44:59,400
the head thing,
the light in front of the picture light

2293
01:44:59,570 --> 01:45:02,330
behind me.
I need to see if [inaudible] on an ige

2294
01:45:02,331 --> 01:45:06,650
story before and then you just blast
yourself like 20 minutes.

2295
01:45:06,830 --> 01:45:10,760
And if I do that for two or three days,
like my circadian rhythm just right back

2296
01:45:10,761 --> 01:45:12,830
on time,
right back on time.

2297
01:45:12,980 --> 01:45:16,100
And I and I fall asleep,
but I'm supposed to fall asleep.

2298
01:45:16,100 --> 01:45:18,530
You know,
I got to bed at like 10:00 PM I get up

2299
01:45:18,531 --> 01:45:21,500
about 6:00 AM and that's,
that's my cycle every day.

2300
01:45:21,710 --> 01:45:23,770
But I just blast myself with light when
I get,

2301
01:45:23,780 --> 01:45:25,820
for me,
lack of food is a good one,

2302
01:45:25,850 --> 01:45:28,370
you know,
make sure you use some sort of fasting

2303
01:45:28,430 --> 01:45:29,280
in order,
you know,

2304
01:45:29,281 --> 01:45:32,210
to regulate everything when you're
traveling and then exercise.

2305
01:45:32,211 --> 01:45:33,570
Those are the two big ones.
Yeah.

2306
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:37,610
And then eating after after rigorous
training puts everything sort of back

2307
01:45:37,611 --> 01:45:39,590
into perspective.
How do you fast,

2308
01:45:39,710 --> 01:45:42,170
what's your fasting protocol?
16 hours every night.

2309
01:45:42,590 --> 01:45:45,560
Every single night now.
One or two nights a week I'll fuck off.

2310
01:45:45,950 --> 01:45:49,400
What about like longer fests during the
don't at all?

2311
01:45:49,490 --> 01:45:50,450
No,
haven't done that.

2312
01:45:50,570 --> 01:45:51,920
I started doing it.
Yeah.

2313
01:45:52,010 --> 01:45:56,210
I started last year to,
my protocol now is 12 to six hours of

2314
01:45:56,211 --> 01:45:58,100
intermittent fast every day.
Christmas,

2315
01:45:58,101 --> 01:45:59,300
thanksgiving,
what it like.

2316
01:45:59,510 --> 01:46:01,340
As soon as I stopped and I'm
competitive,

2317
01:46:01,341 --> 01:46:02,390
I'll set my watch.

2318
01:46:02,660 --> 01:46:05,180
If I finish eating at 8:00 PM I don't
eat again until 8:00 AM.

2319
01:46:05,450 --> 01:46:07,880
If I finish eating at midnight,
then I,

2320
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,550
I don't eat again until you know,
gibbon midnight,

2321
01:46:10,551 --> 01:46:12,650
first snack.
I won't eat again until lunch at least

2322
01:46:12,651 --> 01:46:16,310
12:00 PM so I do that every day.
And then when I started doing,

2323
01:46:16,311 --> 01:46:19,760
once valter Longo came out with his
research on the longevity diet and this

2324
01:46:19,761 --> 01:46:23,840
whole idea of a fasting mimicking diet
inducing cellular autophagy and

2325
01:46:23,841 --> 01:46:27,920
enhancing longevity to the same extent
as if you were just do like a pure water

2326
01:46:27,921 --> 01:46:31,790
fast or stop eating.
So what you do is on a quarterly basis,

2327
01:46:31,940 --> 01:46:34,940
four times a year,
you were strict the normal amount of

2328
01:46:34,941 --> 01:46:38,600
calories that you would eat to 40% of
what you'd normally eat.

2329
01:46:38,870 --> 01:46:41,990
So maybe you're doing,
maybe you're just dropping one meal or

2330
01:46:41,991 --> 01:46:45,110
for every meal that you eat,
you're eating a little bit less and you

2331
01:46:45,111 --> 01:46:48,200
do this for five days on a quarterly
basis.

2332
01:46:48,440 --> 01:46:51,780
I started doing that last year and I
just have like this stew that I make

2333
01:46:51,781 --> 01:46:55,470
with split Mung beans and Basmati rice
and it's called a,

2334
01:46:55,471 --> 01:46:58,500
it's called kitchery.
It's an Indian Ayurvedic Cleansing Stew,

2335
01:46:59,130 --> 01:47:04,130
Dr Logos company L Nutra sends out these
kits called prolonged kits that are all

2336
01:47:05,041 --> 01:47:07,050
done for you.
But I just wanted to,

2337
01:47:07,051 --> 01:47:09,000
to make,
make my own stew.

2338
01:47:09,030 --> 01:47:11,760
That's easy for me.
I put a little coconut yogurt on it and

2339
01:47:11,761 --> 01:47:14,910
that's just breakfast,
lunch and dinner for me for five days in

2340
01:47:14,911 --> 01:47:15,960
a row.
It's almost like a,

2341
01:47:15,990 --> 01:47:19,470
like a seasonal cleaning.
So you do that four times a year.

2342
01:47:19,500 --> 01:47:22,080
And the only other thing that I do is
one or two times a month.

2343
01:47:22,440 --> 01:47:26,160
I try to go from Saturday dinner to
Sunday dinner without eating.

2344
01:47:26,190 --> 01:47:30,000
So it's almost a 24 hour fast.
And with those three things,

2345
01:47:30,060 --> 01:47:35,060
12 six and Ironman fast,
the quarterly five day like modified

2346
01:47:35,071 --> 01:47:39,180
fast and then the 24 hour fast one to
two times a month.

2347
01:47:39,510 --> 01:47:41,940
That's sustainable for me.
I could still perform,

2348
01:47:41,970 --> 01:47:44,390
I could still work out.
Um,

2349
01:47:44,850 --> 01:47:46,440
I think,
I think that's the way to go.

2350
01:47:46,500 --> 01:47:48,360
How do you feel when you do that?
24 hour fast?

2351
01:47:48,680 --> 01:47:52,290
Because it's a pretty good workout at
2:00 PM you get hungry the 2:00 PM in

2352
01:47:52,291 --> 01:47:54,750
the afternoon on Sunday.
Cause what I'll do is I'll have dinner

2353
01:47:54,751 --> 01:47:58,170
on Saturday and then I'll wait the whole
day and then I'll have a big Sunday

2354
01:47:58,171 --> 01:47:59,190
dinner.
And honestly,

2355
01:47:59,191 --> 01:48:03,600
it doesn't affect the workouts that much
because the magic of fasting seems to be

2356
01:48:03,601 --> 01:48:06,720
the compressed feeding window and not
the calorie restriction,

2357
01:48:06,780 --> 01:48:08,520
right.
This returns to not wanting to be hungry

2358
01:48:08,521 --> 01:48:10,710
and cold and libido lists if you're
going to live a long time.

2359
01:48:11,040 --> 01:48:15,570
So the idea is that you could fast from
Saturday dinner to Sunday dinner and

2360
01:48:15,571 --> 01:48:18,690
have a giant ribeye steak,
sweet potato fry,

2361
01:48:18,990 --> 01:48:19,890
you know,
red wine,

2362
01:48:19,920 --> 01:48:21,960
dark chocolate,
Halo,

2363
01:48:21,961 --> 01:48:23,820
top ice cream,
whatever you,

2364
01:48:23,850 --> 01:48:26,700
whatever you want at the end of the day
on Sunday,

2365
01:48:26,760 --> 01:48:30,450
eat 3,500 calories and then you're just,
you're topped off and you're ready for

2366
01:48:30,451 --> 01:48:33,870
the next day and you have a long period
in which you're engaged in cellular

2367
01:48:33,871 --> 01:48:35,580
cleanup,
cellular autophagy.

2368
01:48:35,820 --> 01:48:37,380
But he kind of get to have your cake and
eat it too,

2369
01:48:37,381 --> 01:48:38,820
cause you have a bunch of calories at
the end of that.

2370
01:48:38,880 --> 01:48:40,650
Are you drinking coffee?
Yeah.

2371
01:48:40,980 --> 01:48:44,970
So coffee's fine.
I was actually surprised you didn't ask

2372
01:48:44,971 --> 01:48:48,240
me when I brought in the sourdough bread
and the and the coconut macaroons and

2373
01:48:48,241 --> 01:48:50,850
everything,
if they would take you out of Ketosis or

2374
01:48:50,851 --> 01:48:54,170
break your fast,
I get that question a lot now when

2375
01:48:54,171 --> 01:48:56,610
people are like,
well let's put dominant people,

2376
01:48:56,630 --> 01:48:58,710
uh,
people want to know if the butter in

2377
01:48:58,711 --> 01:49:00,750
your coffee and you know,
putting a hundred calories of butter in

2378
01:49:00,751 --> 01:49:03,600
your coffee is going to break your fast.
Basically.

2379
01:49:03,601 --> 01:49:06,000
The idea is if it has calories,
it breaks your fast.

2380
01:49:06,210 --> 01:49:08,850
It doesn't have calories,
it doesn't break your fast zero

2381
01:49:08,860 --> 01:49:11,160
calories.
It's negligible.

2382
01:49:11,220 --> 01:49:15,660
It's like a few cholesterol molecules
and like the where they call a coffee

2383
01:49:15,661 --> 01:49:18,090
stall and the we all and so,
and even that,

2384
01:49:18,300 --> 01:49:20,790
if you use the paper filter,
you're filtering a lot of that out.

2385
01:49:20,820 --> 01:49:23,520
That's actually why I like French press
cause you're not filtering some of those

2386
01:49:23,521 --> 01:49:27,000
like brain spinning compounds.
Have you fucked around with any of that

2387
01:49:27,001 --> 01:49:29,940
four sigmatic mushroom coffee and yeah,
I loved that stuff.

2388
01:49:29,941 --> 01:49:32,040
That's actually,
that's actually before I came over here,

2389
01:49:32,041 --> 01:49:36,010
I had a cup of coffee and I had a packet
of that four sigmatic Mane.

2390
01:49:36,280 --> 01:49:37,830
Yeah,
just get it for cognition.

2391
01:49:37,860 --> 01:49:38,760
Yeah.
I uh,

2392
01:49:38,761 --> 01:49:40,710
I've been drinking there.
Those little packets.

2393
01:49:40,770 --> 01:49:41,750
Yeah.
Fantastic.

2394
01:49:41,751 --> 01:49:43,190
It's a sponsor now.
Yeah.

2395
01:49:43,820 --> 01:49:44,760
Yeah,
I know that.

2396
01:49:44,761 --> 01:49:47,260
Good Fan Taro,
he lives down in Venice beach.

2397
01:49:47,650 --> 01:49:48,483
Smart Guy.
They,

2398
01:49:48,550 --> 01:49:50,580
they do place for a guy that makes
mushroom coffee.

2399
01:49:50,710 --> 01:49:52,760
They do a good job with their mushrooms,
so,

2400
01:49:52,780 --> 01:49:54,850
so yeah,
anything that has calories going to take

2401
01:49:54,851 --> 01:49:57,730
you out of fast.
But I'll drink a black coffee,

2402
01:49:57,790 --> 01:49:59,980
green tea,
both of those enhance your fatty acid

2403
01:49:59,981 --> 01:50:02,200
burning.
So it's actually enhancing the benefits

2404
01:50:02,201 --> 01:50:03,034
of a fast.

2405
01:50:03,730 --> 01:50:06,910
Occasionally if I'm going to do a pretty
epic workout,

2406
01:50:07,300 --> 01:50:12,300
the two things that I'll use in combo
are ketone esters with essential amino

2407
01:50:13,331 --> 01:50:15,970
acids.
You combine though it's very low number

2408
01:50:15,971 --> 01:50:17,890
of calories,
but that's like rocket fuel,

2409
01:50:18,010 --> 01:50:21,890
how much you get done at [inaudible],
about 10 grams of essential amino acids.

2410
01:50:21,891 --> 01:50:24,850
And then the key tones,
what I've been doing is a shot glass of

2411
01:50:24,851 --> 01:50:29,851
this stuff called a it ketone aid.
And then there's another company called

2412
01:50:30,300 --> 01:50:33,730
[inaudible] that does like it.
They all taste like ass,

2413
01:50:34,180 --> 01:50:37,540
but you combine those with like a little
bit of amino acids,

2414
01:50:37,541 --> 01:50:40,180
so you have high ketones,
hi amino acids.

2415
01:50:40,181 --> 01:50:43,090
But neither of those are insulinogenic
so it still keeps you in a,

2416
01:50:43,091 --> 01:50:47,020
in a relatively fast and state if you
want to go to a hard workout or maintain

2417
01:50:47,021 --> 01:50:50,460
muscle or whatever.
What about the mushrooms?

2418
01:50:50,461 --> 01:50:52,210
You ever fuck around with those and
they're amazing?

2419
01:50:52,420 --> 01:50:53,201
Yeah.
Yeah.

2420
01:50:53,201 --> 01:50:56,920
I like cordyceps.
They seem to act primarily on some of

2421
01:50:56,921 --> 01:51:00,010
the,
some of the pathways for oxygenation

2422
01:51:01,030 --> 01:51:03,310
blood cell production long.
She,

2423
01:51:03,311 --> 01:51:05,350
I've got all the,
I've got all the on it and stuff.

2424
01:51:05,380 --> 01:51:08,020
Yeah,
I'm shroom tech is good.

2425
01:51:08,410 --> 01:51:10,730
Um,
actually four sigmatic does,

2426
01:51:10,810 --> 01:51:13,510
does a quarter steps as well.
But the other one,

2427
01:51:13,511 --> 01:51:14,950
the uh,
the lion's Mane,

2428
01:51:15,100 --> 01:51:18,160
what I've been doing,
I'll do this about two times a week.

2429
01:51:18,310 --> 01:51:23,310
Stick a very small amount of Siliciden,
the 0.2 grams of Psilocybin,

2430
01:51:23,710 --> 01:51:26,260
and you'd take two packets of that
lion's mane,

2431
01:51:26,270 --> 01:51:31,270
the foursigmatic of lion's mane extract,
and then anything that increases blood

2432
01:51:31,841 --> 01:51:33,940
flow.
So it could be like beet root,

2433
01:51:34,300 --> 01:51:36,760
um,
any nitric oxide precursors,

2434
01:51:36,790 --> 01:51:39,580
you could probably try shroom tech,
um,

2435
01:51:40,030 --> 01:51:41,020
uh,
Niacin,

2436
01:51:41,021 --> 01:51:44,350
a lot of people use Niacin,
but you combine anything that increases

2437
01:51:44,351 --> 01:51:46,780
blood flow,
couple map packets of the lion's Mane

2438
01:51:47,050 --> 01:51:52,050
and then about 0.2 grams of Siliciden
and the cognitive pick me up you get

2439
01:51:52,571 --> 01:51:53,890
from that is profound.

2440
01:51:54,280 --> 01:51:56,050
I mean,
you know that siliciden increases your

2441
01:51:56,051 --> 01:51:59,140
sensory perception,
your ability to pick out color,

2442
01:51:59,230 --> 01:52:00,370
smell,
sense,

2443
01:52:00,371 --> 01:52:01,570
temperature,
et cetera.

2444
01:52:01,810 --> 01:52:04,470
But just for getting through a day of
work or even like going on a,

2445
01:52:04,471 --> 01:52:06,850
on a long hike or um,
uh,

2446
01:52:07,120 --> 01:52:10,330
I would not be surprised if our
ancestors used silicide for hunting

2447
01:52:10,360 --> 01:52:13,540
because you actually do get a pretty
good increase in sensory perception,

2448
01:52:13,541 --> 01:52:16,350
smell and sight from it and visual
acuity as well.

2449
01:52:16,420 --> 01:52:19,330
Yeah.
But that mix works really well where you

2450
01:52:19,331 --> 01:52:21,760
do the lion's mane along with the,
the width,

2451
01:52:21,761 --> 01:52:24,520
the silicide and extract.
It makes sense that there'd be some sort

2452
01:52:24,521 --> 01:52:27,910
of a symbiotic benefit to combining
those sorts of mushrooms together.

2453
01:52:28,060 --> 01:52:29,140
Yeah.
Well,

2454
01:52:29,141 --> 01:52:30,140
it's like that,
uh,

2455
01:52:30,190 --> 01:52:32,950
we were talking about this last time,
that doctrine of signatures,

2456
01:52:32,951 --> 01:52:36,490
the idea that what things look like in
nature could actually give you clues

2457
01:52:36,491 --> 01:52:38,290
about their benefit for the body.

2458
01:52:38,620 --> 01:52:40,330
And when you find lines,
man,

2459
01:52:40,390 --> 01:52:45,340
I don't know if you seen it in nature,
but it looks like this cluster of axons

2460
01:52:45,350 --> 01:52:49,010
and Dendrites,
like it looks like brain cells,

2461
01:52:49,360 --> 01:52:50,270
you know,
up close,

2462
01:52:50,271 --> 01:52:53,000
see if he could find the,
has look up like lion's Mane,

2463
01:52:53,810 --> 01:52:56,720
pretty bad ass looking or like there's a
lot of stuff like that.

2464
01:52:56,721 --> 01:52:57,554
Like,
um,

2465
01:52:57,710 --> 01:53:01,280
there's this place in quiet,
not I go to called quite organic

2466
01:53:01,281 --> 01:53:04,010
pharmacy and they just grow on his tiny
little two acre farm.

2467
01:53:04,280 --> 01:53:06,370
All these different superfoods like you
know,

2468
01:53:06,410 --> 01:53:11,000
Noni and a cow and they've got comfrey
there.

2469
01:53:11,270 --> 01:53:13,820
And if you dig up the root of a comfrey
plant,

2470
01:53:14,120 --> 01:53:15,320
there it is.
Yeah,

2471
01:53:15,350 --> 01:53:18,890
that's lions.
Matt is created and that night's main

2472
01:53:19,310 --> 01:53:22,250
great name for,
but it also looks like dendrites and

2473
01:53:22,251 --> 01:53:25,160
axons and neurons.
So it's very cool.

2474
01:53:25,700 --> 01:53:26,720
Um,
what,

2475
01:53:26,721 --> 01:53:28,150
uh,
Fritz and placing plan,

2476
01:53:28,190 --> 01:53:30,260
I have yet to actually find it in
nature,

2477
01:53:30,261 --> 01:53:31,850
but apparently you can find it up in
the,

2478
01:53:31,910 --> 01:53:35,450
up in the inland northwest where I live
anyways though.

2479
01:53:35,480 --> 01:53:39,440
Comfrey,
they call it nyt bone and the roots look

2480
01:53:39,441 --> 01:53:44,441
like knuckles and joints and human bones
and it's very good for healing up

2481
01:53:44,541 --> 01:53:47,600
fractures or for making like a plaster
for your joints.

2482
01:53:47,840 --> 01:53:50,450
A plastic Humphrey plant plaster.
Yeah.

2483
01:53:50,510 --> 01:53:52,050
Well what,
what that uh,

2484
01:53:52,051 --> 01:53:55,310
that pharmacy in Hawaii does,
they grind it into a powder and then you

2485
01:53:55,311 --> 01:53:59,210
reconstitute that with water and you
smear it over shoulder joint.

2486
01:53:59,211 --> 01:54:01,670
They could just use like a,
like a tee shirt or whatever to hold it

2487
01:54:01,671 --> 01:54:06,230
on there or an ace bandage.
And it actually increases the speed of

2488
01:54:06,231 --> 01:54:10,070
bone healing or joint healing like it.
Like it's an anti inflammatory,

2489
01:54:10,100 --> 01:54:12,890
they do like a,
like a muscle cream with the two made

2490
01:54:12,891 --> 01:54:15,410
out of the conferee.
So it's very interesting.

2491
01:54:15,411 --> 01:54:16,100
There's,
there's,

2492
01:54:16,100 --> 01:54:18,950
there's all sorts of different,
different things in nature that gives

2493
01:54:18,951 --> 01:54:19,671
you clues,
you know,

2494
01:54:19,671 --> 01:54:22,160
like the carrots and the eggs for your
eyes,

2495
01:54:22,760 --> 01:54:24,110
the walnuts for the brain.

2496
01:54:25,350 --> 01:54:27,150
I think there's something to it that
will,

2497
01:54:27,170 --> 01:54:30,170
how does that stuff increase your bone
healing?

2498
01:54:30,200 --> 01:54:31,910
Like what is it doing?
What's the mechanism?

2499
01:54:32,240 --> 01:54:34,010
I don't know.
I don't know.

2500
01:54:34,100 --> 01:54:37,550
It might be like some way of mineral
delivery through the skin,

2501
01:54:37,610 --> 01:54:41,450
something like that.
I've been blown away by CBD by using,

2502
01:54:41,510 --> 01:54:42,343
um,
uh,

2503
01:54:42,570 --> 01:54:44,960
putting,
putting cbd over muscle.

2504
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:46,480
A lot of companies do.
Like,

2505
01:54:46,550 --> 01:54:48,410
you know what the trick with that is?
One of the guys,

2506
01:54:48,411 --> 01:54:52,400
one of the doctors who worked with the
Tour de France teams when showing me

2507
01:54:52,401 --> 01:54:53,810
this,
do you have an electrical muscle

2508
01:54:53,811 --> 01:54:55,160
stimulation unit?
I do.

2509
01:54:55,170 --> 01:54:57,500
I got like a mark pro or a complex or
what have you.

2510
01:54:57,501 --> 01:54:58,161
Yeah,
I got a comp.

2511
01:54:58,161 --> 01:55:02,360
So you put your,
your cbd oil on your magnesium or

2512
01:55:02,570 --> 01:55:03,890
Arnica,
your trauma,

2513
01:55:03,980 --> 01:55:07,850
whatever it is that you're using and you
rub that in and then you put the

2514
01:55:07,851 --> 01:55:12,851
electrodes on top of that and then you
put an ice pack on top of that.

2515
01:55:14,900 --> 01:55:16,770
So it's three things.
You've got the,

2516
01:55:16,820 --> 01:55:19,880
the cream or lotion,
you've got the electrodes,

2517
01:55:19,910 --> 01:55:23,240
and then you've got the,
the topical thing that holds it on and

2518
01:55:23,241 --> 01:55:27,290
the electricity drives the
anti-inflammatory deeper into the

2519
01:55:27,291 --> 01:55:30,560
tissue.
So it enhances the effect of like a cbd

2520
01:55:30,561 --> 01:55:34,040
oil or magnesium.
And the ice allows you to turn up the

2521
01:55:34,041 --> 01:55:37,190
electricity to a higher level without
getting uncomfortable.

2522
01:55:37,430 --> 01:55:40,580
So I do this at home.
I use one called a called a Marc pro and

2523
01:55:40,581 --> 01:55:43,650
just kind of surround the area that's
actually,

2524
01:55:43,710 --> 01:55:44,750
you know,
torn or,

2525
01:55:44,760 --> 01:55:47,370
or that's painful and I'll do a rub like
that.

2526
01:55:47,371 --> 01:55:49,860
But you're right.
CVD oil works amazingly for that.

2527
01:55:50,010 --> 01:55:51,180
Yeah.
That stuff is,

2528
01:55:51,181 --> 01:55:51,861
uh,
it's,

2529
01:55:51,861 --> 01:55:54,150
it's remarkable because it's,
you're,

2530
01:55:54,151 --> 01:55:56,070
you're putting it on the surface of your
skin and it's,

2531
01:55:56,071 --> 01:55:58,260
it,
it's weird how I can get all the way

2532
01:55:58,261 --> 01:56:02,330
deep into a muscle or into a joint like
a,

2533
01:56:02,560 --> 01:56:05,250
a lot of people use it with knee pain
and it's just,

2534
01:56:05,251 --> 01:56:07,830
it's remarkable how well skin is a
mouth.

2535
01:56:08,010 --> 01:56:09,720
Yeah.
That's why some of those personal care

2536
01:56:09,721 --> 01:56:13,500
products are kind of scary.
But a cbd who just don't care,

2537
01:56:13,501 --> 01:56:14,950
products,
personal care products,

2538
01:56:15,320 --> 01:56:17,260
parabens and phthalates.
And you know,

2539
01:56:17,340 --> 01:56:18,400
estrogen,
you know,

2540
01:56:18,410 --> 01:56:21,480
the Fido estrogens and endocrine
disruptors and stuff like that and them,

2541
01:56:21,481 --> 01:56:22,410
I mean,
you know,

2542
01:56:22,411 --> 01:56:23,050
they've,
they've done,

2543
01:56:23,050 --> 01:56:24,720
they've done studies where you know,
like,

2544
01:56:24,900 --> 01:56:28,860
like guys will like take a shower with
the average shampoo that's got,

2545
01:56:28,861 --> 01:56:31,020
you know,
like parabens and phthalates and these

2546
01:56:31,021 --> 01:56:33,870
things that that can be endocrine
disruptors or,

2547
01:56:34,170 --> 01:56:38,580
or phytoestrogen you mimic estrogen in a
man's body and they actually,

2548
01:56:38,610 --> 01:56:43,610
within a short period of time after
taking the shower and using these care

2549
01:56:43,711 --> 01:56:45,960
products,
you can actually detect this stuff in

2550
01:56:45,961 --> 01:56:48,750
their urine.
Like your body is actually soaking this

2551
01:56:48,751 --> 01:56:52,800
up and absorbing it as the very,
very interesting book.

2552
01:56:52,860 --> 01:56:53,940
Uh,
interviewed this guy.

2553
01:56:53,970 --> 01:56:58,950
My podcast is called astro generation,
about how many guys have really high

2554
01:56:58,951 --> 01:57:03,750
estrogen levels now from primarily their
personal care products or their

2555
01:57:03,751 --> 01:57:05,340
household cleaning chemicals.

2556
01:57:05,370 --> 01:57:06,480
So it's true.
That's tough.

2557
01:57:06,510 --> 01:57:08,320
Trying to turn you into a bitch.
Yeah,

2558
01:57:08,700 --> 01:57:12,700
it is more or less over a guy's house
and you see a bunch of sweet smell in

2559
01:57:12,930 --> 01:57:14,570
shampoos.
Surprise me.

2560
01:57:14,590 --> 01:57:15,960
Like,
like when I raced for,

2561
01:57:15,961 --> 01:57:18,590
for a team Timex,
we used to train out at the,

2562
01:57:18,591 --> 01:57:23,190
the giant stadium in New Jersey and I go
in the locker room there and it's just

2563
01:57:23,191 --> 01:57:25,020
like this.
You'd think that the,

2564
01:57:25,040 --> 01:57:30,040
the peak of performance and professional
sports would have started looking into

2565
01:57:30,091 --> 01:57:32,910
by this point,
how could you keep testosterone is high

2566
01:57:32,911 --> 01:57:35,730
as possible on a male athletes body.
Right?

2567
01:57:35,760 --> 01:57:39,810
But you walk into the bathroom and it's
just like every end of can disrupt or

2568
01:57:39,811 --> 01:57:43,200
known to man.
Just like lined up in a pretty shiny row

2569
01:57:43,440 --> 01:57:45,840
there on the shelf in front of the
meeting of the shaving cream and the

2570
01:57:45,841 --> 01:57:47,890
shampoos and the spray deodorant.

2571
01:57:47,960 --> 01:57:50,400
Just like,
I mean any,

2572
01:57:50,401 --> 01:57:53,280
I did not all shaving cream,
but if it's,

2573
01:57:53,281 --> 01:57:55,980
if it's something that has those kinds
of chemicals in it,

2574
01:57:56,040 --> 01:57:58,980
absolutely.
Have you ever used Dr Carver's shave

2575
01:57:58,981 --> 01:58:01,600
butter and that sounds familiar.
It's a,

2576
01:58:01,630 --> 01:58:02,550
it's a,
uh,

2577
01:58:02,570 --> 01:58:04,600
dollar shave club,
a product.

2578
01:58:04,630 --> 01:58:07,560
It's the most fun,
incredible shaving cream of all time.

2579
01:58:07,590 --> 01:58:10,080
Like you'll regular shaving cream.
You will,

2580
01:58:10,081 --> 01:58:12,600
you won't,
you just won't use it after you try that

2581
01:58:12,601 --> 01:58:15,250
stuff.
I think I've tried that because he's s

2582
01:58:15,630 --> 01:58:18,840
this probably happens to you.
You get lots of lots of personal care

2583
01:58:18,841 --> 01:58:21,460
products since your studio.
I'm home.

2584
01:58:21,600 --> 01:58:22,920
Yeah,
but that stuff blows me away.

2585
01:58:22,950 --> 01:58:25,440
It's like a butter.
I mean it was called the Dr Carver's.

2586
01:58:25,490 --> 01:58:26,430
Yeah.
Huh.

2587
01:58:26,610 --> 01:58:28,020
Yeah.
Interesting.

2588
01:58:28,170 --> 01:58:31,070
I'll get them sent us off to try to try
and be blown away by.

2589
01:58:31,090 --> 01:58:33,510
I don't have to shave that much,
so don't have him send very much.

2590
01:58:33,540 --> 01:58:35,010
You don't cheat.
You don't grow a lot of [inaudible]

2591
01:58:35,100 --> 01:58:36,180
girl.
A lot of facial hair.

2592
01:58:36,300 --> 01:58:37,410
No.
No,

2593
01:58:37,860 --> 01:58:38,521
but yeah,
these,

2594
01:58:38,521 --> 01:58:41,620
these uh,
all your experimenting you'd think and

2595
01:58:41,630 --> 01:58:44,620
think something would have sprouted,
but you'd think it'd be kind of weird.

2596
01:58:44,621 --> 01:58:48,820
Like it just be like one right side
patch of the chin and it's like a hair.

2597
01:58:48,821 --> 01:58:50,530
But there is a mole attached to the
hair.

2598
01:58:50,560 --> 01:58:51,630
Do you ever wonder,
let's go.

2599
01:58:52,080 --> 01:58:54,820
It's going to yourself.
Stem cells bleeding out the end.

2600
01:58:55,530 --> 01:58:59,050
Sit in bed occasionally.
Like there's some of this stuff on stem

2601
01:58:59,051 --> 01:59:02,710
cells that admittedly are a little bit
of like adventure into human

2602
01:59:02,711 --> 01:59:05,650
experimentation without robust evidence
of safety.

2603
01:59:05,680 --> 01:59:07,420
How about the one where you shot onto
your deck?

2604
01:59:07,950 --> 01:59:09,400
That's,
that's a good example.

2605
01:59:09,430 --> 01:59:10,900
Yeah.
But,

2606
01:59:10,901 --> 01:59:11,734
uh,
I'm,

2607
01:59:11,930 --> 01:59:15,790
I'm kind of shifting my whole philosophy
on stem cells to kind of go after stuff

2608
01:59:15,791 --> 01:59:17,540
from my own body as much as possible.

2609
01:59:18,290 --> 01:59:20,230
Being autologous,
you know,

2610
01:59:20,231 --> 01:59:21,910
you're on like that one I did in New
York City,

2611
01:59:21,911 --> 01:59:25,390
he says it's not somebody else's blog,
it's just my own stuff.

2612
01:59:25,391 --> 01:59:27,670
Or you know,
in some cases you could argue that

2613
01:59:27,700 --> 01:59:32,700
placental or umbilical or amniotic cells
are so young and so plurry potent,

2614
01:59:35,050 --> 01:59:36,730
you know,
and if they don't have the,

2615
01:59:37,090 --> 01:59:37,841
the,
the,

2616
01:59:37,841 --> 01:59:39,280
uh,
the DNA in the nucleus,

2617
01:59:39,281 --> 01:59:41,680
which apparently they can,
they can kill off somehow,

2618
01:59:41,681 --> 01:59:45,430
which is how they make exosomes.
Like you're not getting somebody else's

2619
01:59:45,431 --> 01:59:46,630
DNA,
you know,

2620
01:59:46,660 --> 01:59:47,240
it's,
it's,

2621
01:59:47,240 --> 01:59:50,770
it's just something your body would've
made anyways and recognize itself.

2622
01:59:51,100 --> 01:59:51,940
So,
yeah,

2623
01:59:51,941 --> 01:59:54,250
some sometimes though,
um,

2624
01:59:54,820 --> 01:59:58,120
sometimes though I probably have taken
it too far with a few of those things,

2625
01:59:58,570 --> 01:59:59,200
but,
uh,

2626
01:59:59,200 --> 02:00:03,220
but the cbd that you were talking about,
I'm a huge fan of,

2627
02:00:03,280 --> 02:00:06,150
I take cbd before bed every night.
Um,

2628
02:00:06,330 --> 02:00:10,150
[inaudible] a lot of it,
when you look at the studies on cbd for

2629
02:00:10,151 --> 02:00:13,960
anxiety and for sleep,
most of them are pushing 100 and up to

2630
02:00:13,961 --> 02:00:16,420
900 milligrams,
which is nuts.

2631
02:00:16,420 --> 02:00:20,650
When you look at the actual serving size
of the average cbd tincture or a capsule

2632
02:00:20,651 --> 02:00:22,370
or pill,
it's like 10 now,

2633
02:00:22,530 --> 02:00:25,270
so you got to take a lot of it.
But I sleep like a baby.

2634
02:00:25,271 --> 02:00:28,960
Like last night I got the ring that I do
my sleep squad.

2635
02:00:29,230 --> 02:00:33,340
I slept eight and a half hours last
night and I take a hundred milligrams of

2636
02:00:33,340 --> 02:00:35,650
CBD.
I take a little bit of Melatonin and I'm

2637
02:00:35,651 --> 02:00:37,720
just out.
But you got to take a lot of,

2638
02:00:37,721 --> 02:00:39,730
and you wake up kind of groggy when you
do read it.

2639
02:00:39,850 --> 02:00:41,980
But if you're used to that and you know,
like you get up,

2640
02:00:41,981 --> 02:00:43,810
shake it off,
10 minutes later you're good to go.

2641
02:00:43,990 --> 02:00:45,480
What's the radio was coming?
Well,

2642
02:00:45,850 --> 02:00:48,280
probably just overstimulation of the
endocannabinoid system.

2643
02:00:48,340 --> 02:00:51,280
Here's like super relaxed,
which I want to be when I sleep.

2644
02:00:51,310 --> 02:00:52,061
Right,
of course.

2645
02:00:52,061 --> 02:00:52,894
Yeah.
Yeah,

2646
02:00:53,230 --> 02:00:53,980
yeah,
it works.

2647
02:00:53,980 --> 02:00:55,450
What about regular marijuana?

2648
02:00:55,450 --> 02:00:57,040
Does that affect your,
your sleep?

2649
02:00:57,041 --> 02:01:02,041
Do you find it beneficial or no?
So cbd can enhance your deep sleep

2650
02:01:02,261 --> 02:01:04,030
cycles,
which is,

2651
02:01:04,031 --> 02:01:08,260
which is when a good majority of your
neuronal repair and recovery occurs.

2652
02:01:08,950 --> 02:01:13,420
THC allows you to sleep and it actually
decreases sleep latency,

2653
02:01:13,540 --> 02:01:18,250
how long it takes you to fall asleep.
But it does reduce the amount of time

2654
02:01:18,251 --> 02:01:20,290
you spend in deep sleep,
right?

2655
02:01:20,291 --> 02:01:22,720
So if you're,
if you're one of those people whose mind

2656
02:01:22,721 --> 02:01:25,220
races who's hyper charged up when it,
you know,

2657
02:01:25,240 --> 02:01:28,990
and you got to get to sleep at night,
use thc light,

2658
02:01:28,991 --> 02:01:31,150
like you know,
hit a vape pen or whatever,

2659
02:01:31,390 --> 02:01:35,260
but know that you might miss out on some
of the things you want during deep

2660
02:01:35,261 --> 02:01:37,240
sleep,
memory consolidation,

2661
02:01:37,510 --> 02:01:39,650
neuronal repair and recovery.
You know,

2662
02:01:39,651 --> 02:01:44,480
nervous system repair,
but it's still pretty decent sleep and

2663
02:01:44,481 --> 02:01:48,770
you're not getting as much of a
reduction in deep sleep as you would get

2664
02:01:48,771 --> 02:01:52,850
if you were to be taking like Ambien or
valium or something that's literally

2665
02:01:52,851 --> 02:01:56,810
just like a sledge hammer for your
frontal cortex that knocks you out.

2666
02:01:56,810 --> 02:01:59,690
But you almost get no deep sleep.
So if you do this,

2667
02:01:59,691 --> 02:02:02,120
if you were to get like a sleep tracker
and test your deep sleep levels,

2668
02:02:02,330 --> 02:02:06,710
you would find that with cbd you don't
fall asleep as fast,

2669
02:02:06,830 --> 02:02:10,970
but you get higher deep sleep levels and
then with thc you can fall asleep

2670
02:02:10,971 --> 02:02:13,790
faster,
but your deep sleep isn't quite as high.

2671
02:02:14,330 --> 02:02:17,750
When you consider that CBD can
counteract a lot of effects that thc,

2672
02:02:18,290 --> 02:02:22,910
then that means that what you could try
is take thc to lie to fall asleep

2673
02:02:22,911 --> 02:02:25,160
faster,
but then pile a whole bunch of cbd on

2674
02:02:25,161 --> 02:02:27,280
top of that.
And I've done that before too,

2675
02:02:27,300 --> 02:02:30,740
were just take a hit on a vape pen and
then take a bunch of cbd and you shoot

2676
02:02:30,741 --> 02:02:33,800
for the best of both worlds.
Folks that are taking ambient,

2677
02:02:33,830 --> 02:02:36,470
I mean that is,
I mean especially people that are doing

2678
02:02:36,471 --> 02:02:40,250
it virtually every night,
that has got to have a profound effect

2679
02:02:40,251 --> 02:02:42,170
on your brain's ability to recover.

2680
02:02:42,920 --> 02:02:46,190
I think there are a lot of people
shorting themselves on the life who are

2681
02:02:46,191 --> 02:02:47,960
taking ambien or valium.
I mean,

2682
02:02:47,961 --> 02:02:49,760
I,
I think to start with sleep,

2683
02:02:50,030 --> 02:02:54,410
you need to rely on your body's own
internal chemistry and that would be

2684
02:02:54,411 --> 02:02:57,230
breath work.
Like I think everybody before they start

2685
02:02:57,231 --> 02:03:01,340
taking whatever phosphatidyl,
searing and adaptogenic herbs and all

2686
02:03:01,341 --> 02:03:05,180
this shit for cortisol and before they
start taking valium or Ambien or

2687
02:03:05,181 --> 02:03:08,450
anything else for sleep,
you should learn how to control your

2688
02:03:08,451 --> 02:03:11,960
physiology with your breath.
I think that's the most powerful way to

2689
02:03:11,961 --> 02:03:13,020
do it.
I mean,

2690
02:03:13,100 --> 02:03:15,350
you Prawna your shock or whatever you
want to call it,

2691
02:03:15,620 --> 02:03:18,260
like being able to do things like breath
work,

2692
02:03:18,261 --> 02:03:21,290
box breathing,
alternate nostril breathing,

2693
02:03:21,620 --> 02:03:23,780
uh,
even even holotropic breathing,

2694
02:03:23,781 --> 02:03:27,710
like you can go some very interesting
places in terms of dmt production by the

2695
02:03:27,711 --> 02:03:30,720
pineal gland,
by just doing holotropic breathwork.

2696
02:03:30,740 --> 02:03:33,200
Like there's,
there's a lot of very interesting things

2697
02:03:33,201 --> 02:03:37,490
that you can do with your breath.
But I think that for getting to sleep or

2698
02:03:37,491 --> 02:03:40,670
for decreasing stress,
you start with the breath and then you

2699
02:03:40,671 --> 02:03:42,290
start to introduce some of these other
molecules.

2700
02:03:42,291 --> 02:03:47,030
But ambien valium like in the era of
like readily available cvd and you know,

2701
02:03:47,031 --> 02:03:48,980
all the other sleep compounds that we
have available,

2702
02:03:48,981 --> 02:03:52,670
like Valerian and passion flower and
mill and you know,

2703
02:03:52,760 --> 02:03:56,960
all of those are what are called gamma
aminobutyric acid or Gaba precursors.

2704
02:03:56,961 --> 02:03:59,000
They produce inhibitory
neurotransmitters.

2705
02:03:59,540 --> 02:04:01,340
I God,
I don't understand why people are still

2706
02:04:01,341 --> 02:04:03,650
taking ambien and valium because they're
idiots.

2707
02:04:03,830 --> 02:04:05,630
Yeah.
There's this addicted to it or they just

2708
02:04:05,631 --> 02:04:06,411
want a pill.
I mean,

2709
02:04:06,411 --> 02:04:09,410
that's essentially what it is.
They want some fat in their box and they

2710
02:04:09,411 --> 02:04:11,840
want ambien and invalid.
I don't know if it's the same folks,

2711
02:04:11,841 --> 02:04:12,940
but many times it is.

2712
02:04:13,290 --> 02:04:16,250
I think it's our president.
I think our president takes that shit.

2713
02:04:16,610 --> 02:04:18,020
He,
I think he's sleeping with ambien.

2714
02:04:18,050 --> 02:04:20,030
I think a lot of politicians do that.
Yeah.

2715
02:04:20,031 --> 02:04:23,150
Well the can't sleep otherwise they're
fucking ruining the world.

2716
02:04:23,420 --> 02:04:24,120
I,
um,

2717
02:04:24,120 --> 02:04:24,751
I,
I,

2718
02:04:24,751 --> 02:04:28,070
I've found that if my brain is racing,
just completely concentrating on

2719
02:04:28,071 --> 02:04:31,340
breathing in and breathing out and
concentrating on just the breath itself,

2720
02:04:31,341 --> 02:04:34,520
like really being cognizant of it and
slow,

2721
02:04:35,120 --> 02:04:40,120
deliberate breaths in and out and in.
And now by doing that over long periods

2722
02:04:40,561 --> 02:04:41,340
of time,
I've,

2723
02:04:41,340 --> 02:04:44,040
I've found that I can,
I can pretty much calmed myself out.

2724
02:04:44,790 --> 02:04:48,030
But that takes focus.
A lot of people are not willing to learn

2725
02:04:48,031 --> 02:04:50,850
how to do that because they want the
fast track out there.

2726
02:04:50,851 --> 02:04:53,010
She'll take a drug and pass out.
That is the thing,

2727
02:04:53,011 --> 02:04:54,150
right?
They just want a pill.

2728
02:04:54,290 --> 02:04:56,880
Yeah.
It's very unfortunate that those things

2729
02:04:56,881 --> 02:05:00,210
exist in that,
that that sort of thinking is,

2730
02:05:00,770 --> 02:05:03,180
you know,
it's reinforced.

2731
02:05:03,360 --> 02:05:04,490
Yeah.
Yeah.

2732
02:05:04,950 --> 02:05:06,140
It's encouraged.
In fact,

2733
02:05:06,141 --> 02:05:10,200
you know,
all these ads and all these doctors and

2734
02:05:10,270 --> 02:05:12,660
different people,
well if you have a hard time sleeping,

2735
02:05:12,661 --> 02:05:15,030
I'll just write your prescription.
And then next thing you know,

2736
02:05:15,470 --> 02:05:18,210
I mean you look at the animal world,
like they self medicate,

2737
02:05:18,211 --> 02:05:21,090
they'll use clay for parasites and you
know,

2738
02:05:21,091 --> 02:05:24,070
dogs leak grasp who stomach issues and
you know,

2739
02:05:24,071 --> 02:05:28,370
that I guess birds now are putting like
nicotine and cigarettes and their nests.

2740
02:05:28,380 --> 02:05:30,390
Cause there's some kind of benefit to
that.

2741
02:05:30,391 --> 02:05:35,391
And you see animals self-medicating,
you see our ancestors using everything

2742
02:05:35,881 --> 02:05:36,570
from,
you know,

2743
02:05:36,570 --> 02:05:39,330
cannabis to Ceylon cinnamon to,
you know,

2744
02:05:39,331 --> 02:05:41,910
all sorts of different derivatives.
For thousands of years.

2745
02:05:42,150 --> 02:05:46,260
So it's not like supplementation or self
medication or the or the whole creation

2746
02:05:46,261 --> 02:05:50,370
of pharmaceuticals is something that's
unnatural or not acceptable human

2747
02:05:50,371 --> 02:05:52,440
activity.
But once you start to use it as a

2748
02:05:52,441 --> 02:05:55,290
crutch,
I think that's where you run into issues

2749
02:05:55,320 --> 02:05:58,230
like once,
once you deny the human body's ability

2750
02:05:58,231 --> 02:06:03,060
to be able to heal itself or to be able
to decrease stress on its own,

2751
02:06:03,061 --> 02:06:05,280
you begin to rely on these exogenous
chemicals.

2752
02:06:05,280 --> 02:06:07,020
I think that's where you start playing
with fire.

2753
02:06:07,170 --> 02:06:10,950
I just wonder what's happening to
people's minds over longterm use of this

2754
02:06:10,951 --> 02:06:14,310
stuff where you're not going into these
deep sleep cycles and you're using it

2755
02:06:14,311 --> 02:06:16,470
every night because essentially once you
get hooked on it,

2756
02:06:16,920 --> 02:06:19,290
a lot of people have a really hard time
sleeping without it.

2757
02:06:19,380 --> 02:06:20,520
Yeah.
Yeah.

2758
02:06:20,820 --> 02:06:22,770
Um,
I mean they're shorting themselves.

2759
02:06:22,771 --> 02:06:23,604
Right,
right.

2760
02:06:24,130 --> 02:06:28,290
I wonder what studies in the emory,
it's learning like that.

2761
02:06:28,291 --> 02:06:30,300
That's where a lot of that type of stuff
happens.

2762
02:06:30,301 --> 02:06:33,360
I mean it's the same thing with,
with um,

2763
02:06:33,840 --> 02:06:34,601
uh,
what's it called,

2764
02:06:34,601 --> 02:06:36,540
the glymphatic drainage,
like this,

2765
02:06:36,541 --> 02:06:41,010
this new drainage system for the brain
that they've just discovered in recent

2766
02:06:41,010 --> 02:06:44,250
years.
This idea that you actually detoxify the

2767
02:06:44,251 --> 02:06:48,090
brain during the sleep cycles and it's
even enhanced when you sleep on your

2768
02:06:48,091 --> 02:06:50,220
side.
They even looked at sleeping positions

2769
02:06:50,221 --> 02:06:52,950
in this thing called glymphatic
drainage.

2770
02:06:53,220 --> 02:06:57,330
And when you're not going through proper
sleep cycles or you're constantly

2771
02:06:57,331 --> 02:06:59,520
waking,
cause you're on your back and you have a

2772
02:06:59,521 --> 02:07:02,910
lot of people have sleep apnea where
you'll look at their sleep charts and

2773
02:07:02,911 --> 02:07:04,920
they'll frequently wake during the night
or the,

2774
02:07:04,921 --> 02:07:07,740
you'll see periods where they just get
ripped out of deep sleep.

2775
02:07:08,140 --> 02:07:10,200
Yeah.
You wake up and you don't have memory

2776
02:07:10,201 --> 02:07:14,460
consolidation or you don't have the type
of neuronal repair and recovery that

2777
02:07:14,461 --> 02:07:15,670
you'd want or you know,
you,

2778
02:07:15,750 --> 02:07:17,940
you can even short yourself on muscle
repair,

2779
02:07:18,450 --> 02:07:18,991
you know,
and,

2780
02:07:18,991 --> 02:07:20,970
and there's,
there's probably a lot that we don't

2781
02:07:20,971 --> 02:07:25,971
know about just dreaming and its ability
to be able to do things like help form

2782
02:07:26,691 --> 02:07:30,630
memories or,
or make learning or experiences more

2783
02:07:30,631 --> 02:07:32,490
deeply rooted.
But yeah,

2784
02:07:32,491 --> 02:07:33,270
I mean it's,
it's,

2785
02:07:33,270 --> 02:07:36,490
it's,
I think sleep architecture is something

2786
02:07:36,491 --> 02:07:39,640
that just gets super fucked up in a
modern post industrial era.

2787
02:07:39,640 --> 02:07:43,030
We've got access to pharmaceuticals and
just take a sledgehammer to our heads.

2788
02:07:43,390 --> 02:07:44,680
Yeah,
no question about it.

2789
02:07:44,681 --> 02:07:48,070
And it's also,
there's been a lot of work done on

2790
02:07:48,730 --> 02:07:52,510
actually going to sleep with a problem.
It's whole idea of sleep on it.

2791
02:07:52,930 --> 02:07:55,690
Like there's,
there's actually something real to that

2792
02:07:55,691 --> 02:08:00,130
that there are some,
there's some cognitive balancing that's

2793
02:08:00,131 --> 02:08:03,700
going on while you're sleeping,
while your mind is actually going over

2794
02:08:03,701 --> 02:08:07,390
whatever issues you might have and
trying to come up with a problem during

2795
02:08:07,420 --> 02:08:10,720
sleep time during your subconscious,
you don't want to know how many times

2796
02:08:10,721 --> 02:08:13,870
now I,
and I'm learning this as I get older,

2797
02:08:14,410 --> 02:08:19,410
that you delay a decision or you delay
replying to an email or delay responding

2798
02:08:19,631 --> 02:08:23,290
to a text message or what have you until
you've gotten a full night of sleep on

2799
02:08:23,291 --> 02:08:25,510
it and the clarity that you get after
that.

2800
02:08:25,511 --> 02:08:29,660
I mean he just basically think about it
a little bit before you fall asleep and

2801
02:08:29,700 --> 02:08:32,640
then he'd go to sleep and you wake up
with such a better answer.

2802
02:08:32,650 --> 02:08:34,810
The same thing with the lock on it,
like walk on it is another thing.

2803
02:08:34,811 --> 02:08:37,930
We know you,
you make more nerve growth factor and

2804
02:08:37,931 --> 02:08:41,770
more brain derived neurotrophic factor
when you walk while you're learning.

2805
02:08:41,771 --> 02:08:44,790
I recently gave a Tedx talk and I just,
I,

2806
02:08:44,930 --> 02:08:48,870
I made the whole Tedx talk and I learned
the whole thing while I was walking up

2807
02:08:48,871 --> 02:08:52,030
on the farm road back behind my house.
I just walk them through the forest,

2808
02:08:52,360 --> 02:08:55,720
pop out in the sunshine,
walk up and down that road and just

2809
02:08:55,721 --> 02:08:59,710
listened to my ted talk on my earbuds
and give my talk and it's just,

2810
02:08:59,711 --> 02:09:01,330
it's a,
it's amazing for the brain,

2811
02:09:01,990 --> 02:09:03,070
but yeah,
I agree.

2812
02:09:03,100 --> 02:09:05,140
Dwelling on something before you go to
sleep.

2813
02:09:05,560 --> 02:09:07,380
It does the trick.
I always,

2814
02:09:07,420 --> 02:09:10,450
if I do that,
I always have a response the next day.

2815
02:09:10,451 --> 02:09:12,820
That's kinder,
less emotional,

2816
02:09:12,940 --> 02:09:15,280
more understanding,
friendlier,

2817
02:09:18,040 --> 02:09:20,260
reciprocating,
any,

2818
02:09:20,261 --> 02:09:21,820
any sort of good vibes.

2819
02:09:21,850 --> 02:09:22,251
It's,
it's,

2820
02:09:22,251 --> 02:09:23,980
it's really interesting.
It's really,

2821
02:09:23,981 --> 02:09:27,580
it really interesting how there is some
sort of a wisdom that's imparted on you

2822
02:09:27,581 --> 02:09:29,320
while you're sleeping.
There is an,

2823
02:09:29,350 --> 02:09:32,290
and now what I do is I'll think about
what it is,

2824
02:09:32,291 --> 02:09:35,470
but I am a big fan of fiction.
Before he fall asleep.

2825
02:09:35,940 --> 02:09:37,840
He just let you escape to a whole
different world.

2826
02:09:37,841 --> 02:09:40,300
I took my kids on this giant tour of New
York City,

2827
02:09:40,660 --> 02:09:43,430
like we went,
we went to Chelsea market and the high

2828
02:09:43,440 --> 02:09:46,750
line park and the empire state building
and Ellis Island.

2829
02:09:46,751 --> 02:09:50,500
We just did it all.
But we went across the street from

2830
02:09:50,501 --> 02:09:55,270
Central Park to the New York historical
society where they had a Harry Potter

2831
02:09:55,271 --> 02:09:56,890
exhibit.
And we walked in there.

2832
02:09:57,100 --> 02:10:00,880
I've just always been resistant to the
Harry Potter phase late and just,

2833
02:10:01,030 --> 02:10:03,100
I've never read the books and they're
watching the movies.

2834
02:10:03,570 --> 02:10:05,170
Uh,
but my kids really wanted to go.

2835
02:10:05,170 --> 02:10:09,250
So I took him and when I walked through
there and saw all the research,

2836
02:10:09,251 --> 02:10:14,251
the deep research that that j k Rowling
did on Alchemy and herbology and uh,

2837
02:10:17,340 --> 02:10:21,880
and the history of magic and you know,
wizardry in,

2838
02:10:21,910 --> 02:10:25,270
and she,
she actually took a deep dive in all

2839
02:10:25,290 --> 02:10:28,450
this stuff.
She preplanned out all seven of those

2840
02:10:28,451 --> 02:10:30,730
books before she even wrote the first
one.

2841
02:10:30,970 --> 02:10:34,460
And all of her original manuscripts were
in there and letters back and forth to

2842
02:10:34,461 --> 02:10:38,790
the editor and to the publisher.
I walked out the other end of,

2843
02:10:38,850 --> 02:10:40,970
of that exhibit.
It took us about two hours to get

2844
02:10:40,971 --> 02:10:41,331
through,
you know,

2845
02:10:41,331 --> 02:10:43,700
just looking at everything,
thumbing through everything.

2846
02:10:44,030 --> 02:10:47,420
And I was just like a die hard Harry
Potter fan.

2847
02:10:47,470 --> 02:10:49,080
Where is this?
This was that.

2848
02:10:49,400 --> 02:10:53,000
It was one of those things that was at
the New York historical society.

2849
02:10:53,001 --> 02:10:53,834
But you know,
a lot of these,

2850
02:10:53,840 --> 02:10:56,090
they'll do an exhibit and they will kind
of go in and out during the year.

2851
02:10:56,090 --> 02:10:59,360
So I doubt it's still going right now.
Cause this was like three months ago.

2852
02:11:00,140 --> 02:11:00,940
And,
uh,

2853
02:11:00,940 --> 02:11:02,000
you know,
we walked out and I'm,

2854
02:11:02,030 --> 02:11:02,781
you know,
my kids are like,

2855
02:11:02,781 --> 02:11:04,760
Dad,
this is the griffendor wand and this is

2856
02:11:04,761 --> 02:11:05,220
the,
the,

2857
02:11:05,220 --> 02:11:09,310
the slitter or Dumbledore Swan and the
griffendor sweater and the,

2858
02:11:09,311 --> 02:11:12,620
the slither and sweater.
And I just started buying them all the

2859
02:11:12,621 --> 02:11:15,910
sweaters and the wands and now I'm
reading the book.

2860
02:11:15,911 --> 02:11:18,410
So I'm,
I'm halfway through goblet of fire right

2861
02:11:18,411 --> 02:11:21,490
now and I'm actually digging it like 10
year old red all.

2862
02:11:21,491 --> 02:11:22,340
Yeah.
She read a home.

2863
02:11:22,400 --> 02:11:25,400
Isn't the course of a year if you've
gone to the universal ride?

2864
02:11:26,180 --> 02:11:28,790
No,
but they have a brochure for that down

2865
02:11:28,791 --> 02:11:31,640
at the Hilton where I'm staying.
It's amazing.

2866
02:11:31,660 --> 02:11:34,640
And the Harry Potter world ride and it's
incredible.

2867
02:11:35,090 --> 02:11:37,210
Reedy Rod,
where you're on a rollercoaster,

2868
02:11:37,220 --> 02:11:39,710
but it's not three d but it's,
you know,

2869
02:11:39,740 --> 02:11:41,900
augmented or that'll be next for me.

2870
02:11:41,930 --> 02:11:43,610
I'm a fan.
I'll go by myself,

2871
02:11:43,910 --> 02:11:45,860
scream my hands up in the air.
He'll love it.

2872
02:11:45,920 --> 02:11:47,040
Yeah,
it's really good.

2873
02:11:47,460 --> 02:11:49,130
The whole Harry Potter world is really
good.

2874
02:11:49,470 --> 02:11:52,430
It's [inaudible] butter beer though.
It'll give you diabetes.

2875
02:11:52,730 --> 02:11:53,230
Well,
my,

2876
02:11:53,230 --> 02:11:55,210
my,
one of my boys made butter beer first

2877
02:11:55,211 --> 02:11:57,700
class classmates because they've got
like a,

2878
02:11:57,710 --> 02:11:59,540
a,
they helped mom with all this stuff.

2879
02:11:59,541 --> 02:12:02,190
They've got like a cooking podcasts and
they do a,

2880
02:12:02,660 --> 02:12:05,780
their last episode was marshmallows.
They made marshmallows but there's like

2881
02:12:05,781 --> 02:12:09,410
a cup's worth of bone broth and every
marshmallow and it's like this healthy

2882
02:12:09,411 --> 02:12:13,880
like glycine and fuse marshmallow that
they made a dark chocolate fondue with

2883
02:12:14,970 --> 02:12:18,170
coconut flakes,
that much bone broth in a marshmallow.

2884
02:12:18,860 --> 02:12:21,810
What does it feel?
I don't have the recipe but it tastes

2885
02:12:22,050 --> 02:12:25,190
like I'm,
I'm usually not much of a sneaks snacks

2886
02:12:25,191 --> 02:12:27,470
into bed kind of guy.
But I was like taking marshmallows to

2887
02:12:27,471 --> 02:12:29,100
bed,
eating marshmallows,

2888
02:12:29,150 --> 02:12:30,050
reading Harry Potter.

2889
02:12:30,050 --> 02:12:32,990
How much sugar is not a lot.
Not a lot.

2890
02:12:32,991 --> 02:12:33,440
No,
they,

2891
02:12:33,440 --> 02:12:35,360
they're doing a good job with their
podcasts.

2892
02:12:35,361 --> 02:12:38,180
Like they're doing a lot of like,
like black strap,

2893
02:12:38,181 --> 02:12:40,310
molasses,
Stevia,

2894
02:12:40,430 --> 02:12:43,880
raw honey and they're doing like,
uh,

2895
02:12:43,910 --> 02:12:46,160
um,
what else did they make?

2896
02:12:46,161 --> 02:12:47,980
They made like a,
like a uh,

2897
02:12:48,330 --> 02:12:53,330
a gluten free baked donut with a cream
cheese ginger frosting and counted was

2898
02:12:54,121 --> 02:12:58,780
on top that just like you dip it in
coffee and it tastes like a real donut.

2899
02:12:58,920 --> 02:13:01,910
Good low.
They are turning into little little

2900
02:13:01,911 --> 02:13:03,160
chefs.
They didn't make me hungry.

2901
02:13:03,170 --> 02:13:06,620
Guess what?
What's the benefit of grass fed beef

2902
02:13:06,621 --> 02:13:09,380
over regular be fine.
I know there is a benefit but I don't,

2903
02:13:09,620 --> 02:13:11,390
I don't,
I never can recall correctly.

2904
02:13:11,400 --> 02:13:14,870
It's something to do with the most
central fatty acid ratios.

2905
02:13:15,050 --> 02:13:16,520
Yeah.
Cause grain you're going to,

2906
02:13:16,521 --> 02:13:20,840
you're going to have more of the omega
six fatty acids which have been unfairly

2907
02:13:20,841 --> 02:13:23,900
vilified,
meaning that a lot of people are just

2908
02:13:23,901 --> 02:13:25,650
like don't eat any Omega sixes.

2909
02:13:25,700 --> 02:13:28,190
Don't have any arachidonic acid.
Like don't,

2910
02:13:28,460 --> 02:13:30,590
don't overdo your seed,
your nuts,

2911
02:13:30,591 --> 02:13:32,520
your nut.
Kind of like the,

2912
02:13:32,521 --> 02:13:36,210
the orthorexic health world as a whole.
You know like when you read nutrition

2913
02:13:36,211 --> 02:13:39,300
magazines and stuff,
they're like do your Omega threes but be

2914
02:13:39,301 --> 02:13:43,140
careful.
Americans have a 20 to one omega six to

2915
02:13:43,141 --> 02:13:46,200
Omega three ratio.
But the problem is that a mega six is

2916
02:13:46,201 --> 02:13:50,190
that's a lot of those are derived from
what are called parent essential oils.

2917
02:13:50,191 --> 02:13:54,240
And your cell membranes need a certain
amount of omega six fatty acids from

2918
02:13:54,241 --> 02:13:58,080
seeds and nuts and plants and even to a
certain extent,

2919
02:13:58,081 --> 02:14:01,080
grains.
And when you have an excess of Omega

2920
02:14:01,081 --> 02:14:04,440
threes and not enough,
we'll mega six is because you're going

2921
02:14:04,441 --> 02:14:09,441
so far into the fish oil category than
it actually damages a component of your,

2922
02:14:09,841 --> 02:14:12,320
your mitochondria membrane called Cardio
Lipid.

2923
02:14:12,390 --> 02:14:16,980
You actually make less of that and so
interfere with normal sylar activity.

2924
02:14:17,010 --> 02:14:19,100
What seeds are most beneficial?
Uh,

2925
02:14:19,520 --> 02:14:21,270
uh,
I,

2926
02:14:21,350 --> 02:14:24,030
I would imagine the most nutrient dense
ones,

2927
02:14:24,130 --> 02:14:27,120
so specific weitzman's Macadamia.
I mean,

2928
02:14:27,121 --> 02:14:29,430
what I is like almonds,
macadamia nuts,

2929
02:14:29,431 --> 02:14:32,490
prezoned nuts.
I just don't eat the quasi nuts like

2930
02:14:32,880 --> 02:14:34,470
peanuts,
which are,

2931
02:14:34,500 --> 02:14:36,450
you know,
they're not as high in nutrient density.

2932
02:14:36,451 --> 02:14:39,510
They're more of a legume than a nut.
Um,

2933
02:14:39,690 --> 02:14:42,030
I,
a lot of my nuts either raw or lightly

2934
02:14:42,031 --> 02:14:43,860
roasted.
You always look at the label and make

2935
02:14:43,861 --> 02:14:48,180
sure they didn't put a lot of vegetable
oil and canola oil in them a little.

2936
02:14:48,240 --> 02:14:48,640
You know,
I'm,

2937
02:14:48,640 --> 02:14:51,180
I'm a fan of nuts in,
in modern [inaudible] my nuts.

2938
02:14:51,181 --> 02:14:54,210
Like you're nuts if you were going to
have to shell them,

2939
02:14:54,360 --> 02:14:56,520
right?
Like if you've ever had to shell a

2940
02:14:56,521 --> 02:14:59,130
walnut,
you're not going to eat 30 walnuts cause

2941
02:14:59,131 --> 02:15:00,320
that'd be exhausting.
Right?

2942
02:15:01,520 --> 02:15:04,170
Yeah.
I like Shell.

2943
02:15:04,171 --> 02:15:07,410
It's annoying as hell but keeps you from
eating too many of them.

2944
02:15:07,440 --> 02:15:10,200
I buy them shelled and I eat fistfuls of
them.

2945
02:15:10,230 --> 02:15:12,870
Yeah.
Like last night I like a half a bag.

2946
02:15:12,930 --> 02:15:14,790
Yeah,
it pistachios are great for your

2947
02:15:14,791 --> 02:15:16,450
microbiome to,
yeah.

2948
02:15:16,460 --> 02:15:19,650
I actually had a couple of research
studies on that last year that showed an

2949
02:15:19,651 --> 02:15:24,150
improvement in the diversity of the
bacteria in your gut with pistachios.

2950
02:15:24,450 --> 02:15:25,880
That's one of the nuts as good for your
bob,

2951
02:15:25,881 --> 02:15:28,230
probably because of the fiber content in
pistachios,

2952
02:15:28,231 --> 02:15:33,231
but grass fed versus grain fed is
primarily the omega three fatty acids

2953
02:15:33,511 --> 02:15:37,290
may have less of the arachidonic acid,
less of the potentially inflammatory

2954
02:15:37,291 --> 02:15:41,190
omega six fatty acids.
There's probably part of it being that

2955
02:15:41,400 --> 02:15:44,670
grass fed grass finished beef is
generally raised on a farm that's using

2956
02:15:44,671 --> 02:15:46,590
less herbicides,
less pesticides,

2957
02:15:46,591 --> 02:15:49,140
raising their meat and a more
sustainable fashion.

2958
02:15:49,440 --> 02:15:50,910
You know,
giving it less hormones,

2959
02:15:50,911 --> 02:15:53,280
getting less antibiotics.
That's painting with a broad brush.

2960
02:15:53,281 --> 02:15:56,670
But generally grass fed,
there's more to it than just the fatty

2961
02:15:56,671 --> 02:15:57,750
acid composition.

2962
02:15:57,750 --> 02:16:00,810
It's just a better meat overall.
In my,

2963
02:16:00,840 --> 02:16:05,840
well better health wise grain fed beef,
I will not lie like you can,

2964
02:16:05,881 --> 02:16:09,290
you can have a pretty damn tasty fatty
cut of grain fed beef.

2965
02:16:09,330 --> 02:16:13,140
I certainly can,
but I honestly prefer the taste of grass

2966
02:16:13,141 --> 02:16:15,240
fed.
I liked the dense or meet the darker

2967
02:16:15,241 --> 02:16:16,800
meat.
I liked it better.

2968
02:16:16,910 --> 02:16:17,940
It's just,
to me it just,

2969
02:16:18,210 --> 02:16:19,830
it,
it just tastes healthier.

2970
02:16:19,860 --> 02:16:21,450
I just,
I crave it more,

2971
02:16:21,570 --> 02:16:23,280
you know?
And when I go back and forth between the

2972
02:16:23,281 --> 02:16:25,520
two of them,
when I eat grain fed,

2973
02:16:25,630 --> 02:16:30,250
it feels like like a lazy cow.
Like it's mushy and Scott like it's

2974
02:16:30,251 --> 02:16:31,360
good,
it's delicious.

2975
02:16:31,390 --> 02:16:33,220
Don't get me wrong.
But there's a difference.

2976
02:16:33,250 --> 02:16:37,090
It's kind of funny cause I've gone over
to Dubai a few times and tall light

2977
02:16:37,091 --> 02:16:42,091
fitness conferences over there and they
advertise grain fed like they want

2978
02:16:42,161 --> 02:16:44,680
everybody to like when you go to the
rest of it was like this beef is the

2979
02:16:44,681 --> 02:16:49,681
finest grain fed beef fat on a grain
pretty widely recognized as the greatest

2980
02:16:51,250 --> 02:16:52,480
steakhouse in the world.

2981
02:16:52,570 --> 02:16:54,430
That place is all crazy.
That trip,

2982
02:16:54,490 --> 02:16:58,120
I acid,
I didn't like my steak at how fucking

2983
02:16:58,121 --> 02:17:00,040
dare you.
I know I'm gonna get,

2984
02:17:00,041 --> 02:17:03,430
I'm going to get
some rude Brooklyn waiter's going to

2985
02:17:03,431 --> 02:17:04,670
take me out.
But uh,

2986
02:17:05,320 --> 02:17:09,150
I didn't like,
it was just something about like,

2987
02:17:09,250 --> 02:17:12,080
the meat just tastes it,
it tasted like it was drenched in

2988
02:17:12,081 --> 02:17:14,530
vegetable oil.
Like something about it just didn't

2989
02:17:14,531 --> 02:17:18,190
taste right and maybe I had a poor Peter
Luger's experience that doesn't even

2990
02:17:18,191 --> 02:17:20,320
make sense.
I did not enjoy it that much.

2991
02:17:20,321 --> 02:17:22,090
Food.
I ate there and afterwards I'm like,

2992
02:17:22,091 --> 02:17:24,100
I don't think it gets better.
I don't think,

2993
02:17:24,280 --> 02:17:26,350
I don't think food gets better.
Yeah.

2994
02:17:26,410 --> 02:17:28,570
How dare you.
Or New York does have a lot of good

2995
02:17:28,571 --> 02:17:29,980
restaurants,
so y'all,

2996
02:17:29,990 --> 02:17:32,380
they do.
My Buddy David Bouley,

2997
02:17:32,410 --> 02:17:35,650
he's a chef over there and he has this
wonderful restaurant where he brings

2998
02:17:35,651 --> 02:17:40,240
like doctors and nutritionists in and
they teach you about certain aspects of

2999
02:17:40,241 --> 02:17:41,080
the food that you're eating.

3000
02:17:41,080 --> 02:17:45,040
Like I did one there on longevity and I
taught about like having bitters before

3001
02:17:45,041 --> 02:17:48,610
your meal to reduce your,
your glucose and your insulin response

3002
02:17:48,611 --> 02:17:53,560
to the meal and the use of like,
like sweet breads for your thymus gland

3003
02:17:53,561 --> 02:17:58,270
to increase the activity of your immune
system to uh,

3004
02:17:58,271 --> 02:18:00,130
you know,
like a lot of these polyphenols and

3005
02:18:00,131 --> 02:18:04,050
antioxidants from the purples and the
Greens and the blues to uh,

3006
02:18:04,360 --> 02:18:07,390
there were these things called
uncoupling proteins that actually get

3007
02:18:07,391 --> 02:18:10,090
activated with,
with cryotherapy and cold water

3008
02:18:10,091 --> 02:18:13,300
immersion,
but that also are something that get

3009
02:18:13,301 --> 02:18:16,330
activated with the consumption of a,
it's,

3010
02:18:16,380 --> 02:18:20,170
it's like a sea urchin is basically,
it's like a sea urchin foam that they

3011
02:18:20,171 --> 02:18:23,140
did at this dinner.
But basically what he does is he'll

3012
02:18:23,141 --> 02:18:25,720
partner with the physician or the,
or the nutritionist or whatever.

3013
02:18:25,721 --> 02:18:28,660
I make this amazing like four hour,
you know,

3014
02:18:28,750 --> 02:18:33,580
five star meal that's designed to
enhance the health effects and whatever

3015
02:18:33,581 --> 02:18:35,020
it is that you just learned about.

3016
02:18:35,310 --> 02:18:38,500
And I was actually in New York when I
did that blood procedure a couple of

3017
02:18:38,500 --> 02:18:38,730
weeks ago.
I,

3018
02:18:38,730 --> 02:18:42,020
I dropped in there again and eight and
that's when my favorite places to go to

3019
02:18:42,410 --> 02:18:45,340
a steakhouse in New York City.
He's that guy who fucking sprinkles of

3020
02:18:45,341 --> 02:18:47,320
salt.
What the Hell's his name?

3021
02:18:47,470 --> 02:18:49,720
Salt Bay.
He's got a place in New York.

3022
02:18:49,721 --> 02:18:52,600
So you know this guy,
you know know that that fucking,

3023
02:18:52,601 --> 02:18:54,210
that meme,
I don't know.

3024
02:18:54,230 --> 02:18:56,890
The guy's got the saw off,
throw it on the meat.

3025
02:18:57,040 --> 02:18:58,780
No,
you're too busy doing actual work.

3026
02:18:58,930 --> 02:19:00,400
But I like salt.
I like,

3027
02:19:00,640 --> 02:19:02,650
I like good salt.
As a matter of fact,

3028
02:19:02,651 --> 02:19:05,910
you know what the very best salt that
you can get as what this is based on.

3029
02:19:05,950 --> 02:19:09,430
I was with a group of doctors a couple
of months ago in park city and this guy,

3030
02:19:09,431 --> 02:19:12,760
one of the guys who was there was like a
water and assault expert and he did

3031
02:19:12,761 --> 02:19:16,810
what's called a mass spectrometry
analysis of all these popular salt like

3032
02:19:16,811 --> 02:19:21,811
Himalayan Sea salt and Black Kona salt
and as tech salt and Mexican salt and

3033
02:19:22,841 --> 02:19:26,470
you know all these different salts and
analyze them for their,

3034
02:19:26,500 --> 02:19:30,080
their mineral content because you want
high mineral content but their metal

3035
02:19:30,081 --> 02:19:30,950
content,
right?

3036
02:19:30,950 --> 02:19:34,050
Like we know that iron,
especially in guys now we're finding out

3037
02:19:34,060 --> 02:19:35,360
it's not that great.
It's,

3038
02:19:35,361 --> 02:19:38,000
it's oxidated.
It can cause damage associated with

3039
02:19:38,001 --> 02:19:40,700
inflammation.
We know that metals and and

3040
02:19:40,701 --> 02:19:43,280
microplastics and all these kinds of
things are winding up in the food

3041
02:19:43,281 --> 02:19:46,070
supply.
The top of the list in terms of

3042
02:19:46,071 --> 02:19:49,010
cleanliness and it's Celtic salt,
it helped it.

3043
02:19:49,070 --> 02:19:50,930
Celtic salt,
you know blue bag.

3044
02:19:50,960 --> 02:19:54,680
It's kind of like a grey salt and it's
gray because they don't like bleach it,

3045
02:19:55,010 --> 02:19:57,530
but it's still clean.
It's not like pink and reddish cause it

3046
02:19:57,531 --> 02:20:01,250
doesn't have a lot of irons.
Heard of Celtic Celtic's yeah.

3047
02:20:01,430 --> 02:20:02,420
That's amazing.
It's flavorful.

3048
02:20:02,421 --> 02:20:03,650
It's big.
It's big chunk.

3049
02:20:03,651 --> 02:20:06,960
So we're 12 meet rub.
I carry.

3050
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:11,080
So yeah,
I mean you can buy it anywhere.

3051
02:20:11,120 --> 02:20:12,500
Yeah.
Yeah.

3052
02:20:12,530 --> 02:20:14,900
And that,
that stuff is about the healthiest salt

3053
02:20:14,901 --> 02:20:16,050
you can get.
Okay.

3054
02:20:16,100 --> 02:20:17,600
According less dude.
Yeah.

3055
02:20:17,630 --> 02:20:18,680
I like it.
I started,

3056
02:20:18,860 --> 02:20:20,900
you know,
I always travel with some kind of salt.

3057
02:20:21,260 --> 02:20:22,720
My wife gets pissed because,
you know,

3058
02:20:22,790 --> 02:20:25,640
she'll make these amazing meals and the
first thing I do is I just pull out the

3059
02:20:25,641 --> 02:20:30,170
salt does cover everything in Salt,
but I think it's because I excrete a lot

3060
02:20:30,171 --> 02:20:33,300
of salt when I raced for uh,
for,

3061
02:20:33,301 --> 02:20:35,570
for uh,
for timex actually they brought in a

3062
02:20:35,571 --> 02:20:39,740
bunch of physiologists to,
to test our sweat sodium or sweat sodium

3063
02:20:39,741 --> 02:20:41,090
analysis,
meaning that they,

3064
02:20:41,450 --> 02:20:46,450
they measure how much sodium you excrete
for any given volume of sweat and this

3065
02:20:46,881 --> 02:20:48,710
kind of returns,
that whole genetic thing.

3066
02:20:48,860 --> 02:20:52,990
Like when you look at people of a
northern European ancestry who would

3067
02:20:52,991 --> 02:20:55,820
have come from a population that did a
lot of fermenting,

3068
02:20:55,850 --> 02:20:57,890
a lot of curing,
a lot of pickling,

3069
02:20:58,550 --> 02:21:03,080
we would develop some pretty robust
sodium excretion mechanisms,

3070
02:21:03,440 --> 02:21:03,890
right?

3071
02:21:03,890 --> 02:21:06,530
Because we're,
we're preserving our food with salt.

3072
02:21:06,560 --> 02:21:10,070
You don't want all that salt to build up
in the body because theoretically you

3073
02:21:10,071 --> 02:21:12,830
could increase blood pressure,
he could cause some damage if you have

3074
02:21:12,831 --> 02:21:15,660
too much salt.
And when you look at other folks who

3075
02:21:15,690 --> 02:21:16,340
didn't,
you know,

3076
02:21:16,340 --> 02:21:20,330
people who would for example sweat a lot
and live in a hot environment,

3077
02:21:20,360 --> 02:21:23,360
you know like,
like whatever South Africa are very hot

3078
02:21:23,361 --> 02:21:27,980
region of the Philippines or whatever.
They would have some pretty robust salt

3079
02:21:28,250 --> 02:21:32,480
conservation mechanisms to be able to
hold on to sodium and hold on to salt

3080
02:21:32,481 --> 02:21:36,470
because you're sweating more.
While my sweat sodium analysis revealed

3081
02:21:36,471 --> 02:21:40,700
that I lose like two and a half times
more salt in my sweat than the average

3082
02:21:40,701 --> 02:21:43,190
person.
So I think that dictates to a certain

3083
02:21:43,191 --> 02:21:48,191
extent my almost my craving for salt.
When I was racing ironman triathlon,

3084
02:21:49,011 --> 02:21:53,390
I would lay awake at night and I could
feel my blood pounding in my ears after

3085
02:21:53,391 --> 02:21:54,320
a day of training.

3086
02:21:54,560 --> 02:21:57,950
And I started using salt heavily.
And one of the first things that

3087
02:21:57,951 --> 02:22:00,560
happens,
because salt regulates aldosterone,

3088
02:22:00,590 --> 02:22:03,920
which is one of the compounds that
regulates your blood pressure.

3089
02:22:04,640 --> 02:22:07,310
All of that went away.
Like I could fall asleep at night.

3090
02:22:07,311 --> 02:22:08,570
You know,
when you lay your head down on your

3091
02:22:08,571 --> 02:22:11,450
pillow and I couldn't hear the blood
pounding in my ears.

3092
02:22:11,870 --> 02:22:13,430
So for about four years,
I've just,

3093
02:22:13,580 --> 02:22:16,250
I've been salt on everything.
It's a ton of it.

3094
02:22:16,280 --> 02:22:18,080
I'm so,
I got to wrap this up,

3095
02:22:18,220 --> 02:22:19,880
unfortunately.
That was awesome though.

3096
02:22:19,910 --> 02:22:22,100
You're the best dude.
Thank you so much.

3097
02:22:22,130 --> 02:22:24,770
It's always good to talk to your,
I don't know how the fuck you retain all

3098
02:22:24,771 --> 02:22:26,190
this information,
but I'm glad

3099
02:22:26,190 --> 02:22:27,360
you do.
Thanks man.

3100
02:22:27,450 --> 02:22:28,710
Thanks for having me.
My pleasure.

3101
02:22:28,711 --> 02:22:31,740
I'll just give everybody your instagram,
your stub.

3102
02:22:31,950 --> 02:22:34,230
Google Ben Greenfield on.
There you go.

3103
02:22:34,380 --> 02:22:35,520
All right.
Thank you brother.

3104
02:22:35,521 --> 02:22:36,061
I appreciate it.
Thanks,

3105
02:22:36,061 --> 02:22:36,270
ma'am.
