1
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:07,600
Good.
Goodly Moodley Jamie.

2
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,210
We're all hopped up on adderall here at
the,

3
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:15,150
at the Rogan studio with Tj supplied
some adderall.

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,210
He came here from Columbus and they just
give it to you at the airport.

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:18,961
It's like,
you know,

6
00:00:18,961 --> 00:00:21,580
they're handing out little samples.
Yeah,

7
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:24,770
I just got this little guy here,
Anna,

8
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:28,680
wrong.
Imagine if we did come up with a drug

9
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,820
that had adderall like effects but no
negative consequences.

10
00:00:32,821 --> 00:00:35,520
In fact health benefits.
Well I don't know.

11
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,520
Some people are prescribed adderall so
for some people you know,

12
00:00:38,521 --> 00:00:41,310
apparently they just think all right for
you this is good.

13
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,031
Yeah.
Oh No,

14
00:00:42,031 --> 00:00:42,510
no,
no.

15
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:45,030
Does she just let people decide that for
themselves and they just,

16
00:00:45,031 --> 00:00:48,570
you know,
let everyone try adderall and they keep

17
00:00:48,571 --> 00:00:49,560
taking it.
If they don't,

18
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,030
they stopped taking.
Yeah,

19
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,540
I couldn't agree more.
I mean some people obviously benefits

20
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:56,190
them.
They should be able to get it whenever

21
00:00:56,191 --> 00:00:56,580
they want.

22
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:57,750
They shouldn't.
I don't have the,

23
00:00:57,751 --> 00:00:59,310
they should have to go to a doctor about
that.

24
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,050
How about that?
You want to try it?

25
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,760
Two Thousand Fifteen,
16.

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,480
We know what adderall is.
Yeah,

27
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:07,290
they at least have a place where you can
go get a free sample,

28
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:08,700
you know?
Well,

29
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:11,340
how come you can try whiskey?
All you have to do is be of age.

30
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:14,520
You don't have to have any knowledge
whatsoever about whiskey and you can be

31
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,760
on the 21st day or the 21st year of your
life.

32
00:01:17,761 --> 00:01:20,040
The first day you could walk right into
a cvs,

33
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,820
buy a jug of whiskey.
Would no instruction manual?

34
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:25,080
No guidelines?
No.

35
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,110
No one to walk you through it going.
Have you ever done this before?

36
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,420
Do you have any idea what a shot is
like?

37
00:01:30,421 --> 00:01:32,070
You just have to get to try to drink a
glass.

38
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:33,840
You might die,
you know,

39
00:01:33,841 --> 00:01:37,350
thinking back to my first time drinking,
maybe it is a good thing that there's

40
00:01:37,351 --> 00:01:39,320
like some barriers,
you know?

41
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:41,220
Yeah.
Because I don't know.

42
00:01:41,221 --> 00:01:46,221
The first time I got drunk really drunk.
They just handed me like a Coffee Cup

43
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:49,140
full of vodka at a party and I never
even been to a party before because I

44
00:01:49,141 --> 00:01:53,640
was so socially awkward and Shit.
I'm like 17 and my first party and I'm

45
00:01:53,641 --> 00:01:54,840
like,
okay,

46
00:01:54,841 --> 00:01:58,560
I don't know how strong this is,
but I'm just going to assume that one

47
00:01:58,561 --> 00:02:01,110
cup is good.
Oh God.

48
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,110
So I just,
hey,

49
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,010
you know,
it was the,

50
00:02:05,011 --> 00:02:07,740
the rest of the night did not play out
in my favor.

51
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,080
After that,
I had a very similar story.

52
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:12,690
My first time I was in high school,
First Party,

53
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,310
new high school,
just move.

54
00:02:15,311 --> 00:02:19,110
There was all Dorky,
didn't hardly know anybody and I made

55
00:02:19,111 --> 00:02:21,090
friends with this kid.
Jimmy Law is who's still my friend to

56
00:02:21,091 --> 00:02:24,720
this day,
great guy and his fucking party and I

57
00:02:24,721 --> 00:02:29,721
remember I couldn't even smell Jack
Daniels for like years later or I would

58
00:02:29,881 --> 00:02:30,990
get sick to my stomach.

59
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:34,950
I had that problem for awhile.
I grew up in a cab that's always rough.

60
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,070
Throw up in a cab,
like halfway opening the door to

61
00:02:38,071 --> 00:02:39,360
wherever.
Lucky enough to puke.

62
00:02:39,361 --> 00:02:42,450
I always just piss myself.
Is that better?

63
00:02:42,451 --> 00:02:45,360
I think that's better.
It's my pis that's not freaking me out.

64
00:02:45,361 --> 00:02:46,160
Like,
I don't know.

65
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,480
I'd rather know if you puke and then
it's like,

66
00:02:48,481 --> 00:02:51,210
oh God.
And then afterwards you're like,

67
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:51,841
oh,
okay,

68
00:02:51,841 --> 00:02:56,010
I feel I feel kind of better now.
You don't feel good about waking up with

69
00:02:56,011 --> 00:02:58,620
your pants covered in Piss,
especially because by that time you're

70
00:02:58,621 --> 00:03:01,090
almost sober again.
You do have a point,

71
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:02,800
you know?
Then you've got to look down and like,

72
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:05,170
oh my God,
I'm a grown man.

73
00:03:05,171 --> 00:03:07,690
That just piss my pants because I drank
too much.

74
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:09,610
Depends on how you look at it,
man.

75
00:03:09,611 --> 00:03:11,230
I feel like a grown man.
It throws up.

76
00:03:11,231 --> 00:03:13,230
Its more of a pitch to the guy who piss
themselves.

77
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:15,760
All right,
well then I guess I'm less of a bitch.

78
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,560
I think you're right dude.

79
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:23,650
Joe Rogan podcast.
All right dude.

80
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,660
Throw up is a contagious pisses and I
think that's part of the problem with

81
00:03:28,661 --> 00:03:30,400
throw up.
Like if you smelled throw up,

82
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:35,130
you're like immediately you smell it and
you want to start throwing.

83
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:37,090
You never smell someone else's pissed
and be like,

84
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:41,210
I gotta take a piss now you imagine if
that's what it was like if somebody

85
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:42,850
farted and like Ah,
Kinda Shit.

86
00:03:42,851 --> 00:03:46,600
How and when it was contagious.
Yeah.

87
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:49,090
Like oh my God.
I mean burst.

88
00:03:49,091 --> 00:03:51,010
I heard him fart.
Now I got to shit.

89
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,450
What been,
why isn't?

90
00:03:52,451 --> 00:03:54,630
And if you smell diarrhea,
shit,

91
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,870
all my friends had to.
Shit.

92
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,680
Yeah,
I guess.

93
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:01,780
I guess diarrhea is evolutionarily,
like if you,

94
00:04:01,781 --> 00:04:04,120
if you throw up the rest of the people
around like,

95
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:04,920
Oh,
you know,

96
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,680
we're all eating the same shit.
He Sat,

97
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:10,420
we better fucking expelled this stuff to
100 percent.

98
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:13,120
That's exactly what it is.
It's really interesting because uh,

99
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:15,580
I,
I became immune to it for a long time

100
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,920
because I was around Puke so much on
fear factor.

101
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,900
It's,
it's back now.

102
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,740
A little freak out over puke now.
Like if I'm passing through a restaurant

103
00:04:23,741 --> 00:04:25,900
and someone through.
I saw someone throw up recently in

104
00:04:25,901 --> 00:04:26,900
Vegas.
I was,

105
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:30,310
I was close to him when I was like,
oh boy.

106
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:32,980
I felt it a little.
But all the years of fear factor man,

107
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:36,160
I saw people throw up like almost every
week.

108
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:40,240
Pretty much everybody threw up one time.
My fucking brother who's also my

109
00:04:40,241 --> 00:04:42,400
business partner,
we've lived together our entire lives.

110
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:47,230
He got sick and he went to the bathroom
and be in the fucking idiot that he is.

111
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:52,320
He doesn't puke in the toilet.
He pukes in the sink and it fills the

112
00:04:52,331 --> 00:04:55,630
sink to the brim,
to the brim with fucking puke.

113
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,820
Oh No.
Can you guess what?

114
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:59,830
He's so fucking sick.
He can't clean it,

115
00:04:59,831 --> 00:05:04,831
so he has to clean face in the fucking
pool is the most horrible experience in

116
00:05:07,331 --> 00:05:08,550
my life.
Oh,

117
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:13,240
how about those fucking crazy people
that administer colonics and they start

118
00:05:13,241 --> 00:05:15,850
telling you what you're reading by
looking at your shit as it goes through

119
00:05:15,851 --> 00:05:18,640
a tube in front of them.
What about those wacky folk?

120
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,120
I have no experience with that,
so I've never done it either,

121
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:24,790
but everyone that I know that's done it.
Like first of all,

122
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,140
I don't.
I don't think you're necessarily

123
00:05:26,141 --> 00:05:30,100
supposed to do it that way.
I feel like if you eat fiber,

124
00:05:30,101 --> 00:05:31,870
it cleans everything out from the
inside.

125
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:34,270
That's probably better than blowing
water up there.

126
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:37,660
I'll probably gonna get a bunch of
tweets from people that love Kalanick.

127
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,441
Oh yeah.
Well,

128
00:05:38,441 --> 00:05:39,490
everyone's got their little health.

129
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,460
Craziest shit.
Some people think that they can poke

130
00:05:42,461 --> 00:05:46,090
needles in themselves and hit certain
parts of their foot.

131
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,830
And you.
Have you ever seen that reflexology?

132
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,740
Like psychology.
That's bizarre stuff,

133
00:05:50,741 --> 00:05:52,930
right?
Like pulling your toes to fix my

134
00:05:52,931 --> 00:05:55,060
shoulder hurts.
Let me work on your foot.

135
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:56,893
Okay.
You,

136
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,820
I'm sure people believe it,
but I don't.

137
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,110
It seems unlikely.
Yeah.

138
00:06:03,111 --> 00:06:06,500
It doesn't mean maybe,
I don't know anything more research

139
00:06:06,501 --> 00:06:10,160
needed,
but I've talked shit about acupuncture,

140
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:14,990
but apparently people use it works.
Some people use all kinds of things and

141
00:06:14,991 --> 00:06:15,920
say they work.
I mean,

142
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,060
you know,
right.

143
00:06:17,061 --> 00:06:19,250
There's no,
but I think there's actual evidence

144
00:06:19,251 --> 00:06:22,820
about acupuncture and made some sort of
a peer reviewed journal about hey,

145
00:06:22,821 --> 00:06:24,140
if there is,
I'm open to it,

146
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,930
but I'm pretty sure it was pointed out
to me,

147
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:31,430
the mind a little hazy right now.
There's definitely been times when I've

148
00:06:31,431 --> 00:06:34,130
said Shit on a show or in a video and
then I'll be like,

149
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,010
I am fucking certain about this,
and then I get a bunch of messages.

150
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:38,840
I'm like,
these fucking idiots trying to prove me

151
00:06:38,841 --> 00:06:41,240
wrong and I look at their perspective.
I'm like,

152
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,740
Oh shit.
I guess I was wrong.

153
00:06:42,741 --> 00:06:45,530
Well,
in six months I'll just act like I never

154
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:47,690
believed that.
Well,

155
00:06:47,691 --> 00:06:50,570
do you change your mind though because
of people correcting me?

156
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,640
I'd definitely do.
You got to have to.

157
00:06:52,641 --> 00:06:55,520
I don't want to be some close minded
idiot that just believes the same thing

158
00:06:55,521 --> 00:06:56,630
no matter what.
Yeah,

159
00:06:56,631 --> 00:07:00,500
and people love you to be beholden to
your earliest beliefs,

160
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:04,370
like if you had an idea a long time ago
and it was wrong.

161
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,850
Like if he said something I one of your
youtube videos and it turned and you

162
00:07:07,851 --> 00:07:09,570
were like,
this is a fucking fact,

163
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:12,880
and then it turns out to not be a fact
and yeah,

164
00:07:12,881 --> 00:07:15,680
you're not allowed to make a mistake.
It's just immortalized forever in

165
00:07:15,681 --> 00:07:17,160
history like this time.

166
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,630
What about the time you said that it's
like maybe I think differently now

167
00:07:20,631 --> 00:07:23,930
because years and years of time and
experience of pass.

168
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,370
Well you know what happened with dumb
people.

169
00:07:25,371 --> 00:07:30,371
Unfortunately the term flip flopper got
out and what a flip flopper is,

170
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,420
is someone who changes their fucking
mind,

171
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:36,290
which means you're a normal person.
The idea that you're going to be a

172
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:40,610
president or a congressman or senator
and never changed your mind once you

173
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,880
establish this esteemed position,
once you're in there,

174
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:47,330
you get elected,
you got rock solid ideas about how the

175
00:07:47,331 --> 00:07:51,620
world works and you're so enlightened.
You no longer need to learn or correct

176
00:07:51,621 --> 00:07:53,900
your ideas.
That's ridiculous.

177
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,740
But to dummies,
now they have that term.

178
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,200
Oh,
he's a flip flopper fucking tj.

179
00:08:00,201 --> 00:08:05,201
The flip video from seven years ago,
all those life experiences before that,

180
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,530
that fucking dude was saying this,
you're a flip flopper.

181
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,710
I wonder if they're just that consistent
in their lives.

182
00:08:12,711 --> 00:08:14,210
You know,
they just want to find something to fuck

183
00:08:14,211 --> 00:08:16,310
with you on.
They're just trying to poke,

184
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,810
poke out horse,
you know,

185
00:08:17,811 --> 00:08:20,510
that's like the,
the nature of life,

186
00:08:20,511 --> 00:08:21,170
uh,
you know,

187
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:23,880
on the internet or in any sort of public
lens,

188
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,610
even in the wild,
I mean,

189
00:08:25,611 --> 00:08:28,610
it's natural you,
you find a guy like you,

190
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:31,310
you puts out,
you put up these very interesting

191
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:35,510
thought provoking videos.
You have strong opinions and you

192
00:08:35,511 --> 00:08:38,750
broadcast them out there.
And then there's gonna be a bunch of

193
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:40,970
people that respond to them.
Some people really enjoy them,

194
00:08:40,971 --> 00:08:44,520
some people get really mad at you,
but because your stuff is good and that

195
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:47,540
you have really interesting points,
you get a lot of attention.

196
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,390
And when you get a lot of attention,
people go,

197
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,200
fuck that guy,
man.

198
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:52,940
That shit.

199
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:56,030
I'll fucking kick his ass if I see him.
I heard that shit.

200
00:08:56,031 --> 00:08:59,040
He said about all you have to do is put
it in context of lake.

201
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:00,870
You know,
even if you find like,

202
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:04,290
you know Christopher hitchens or
something like the most eloquent fucking

203
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:06,600
guy you can,
there's still gonna be people that fat.

204
00:09:06,601 --> 00:09:07,400
Fuck.
What?

205
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,050
Did you see?
What happened when he doctored?

206
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:09,991
Yeah,
of course.

207
00:09:09,991 --> 00:09:12,750
You know,
he's in hell now he's burning.

208
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,400
Yeah.
Because he's a misogynist.

209
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:15,990
Oh yeah.
Now that's the truth.

210
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:16,650
Yeah,
that's that,

211
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:19,410
that little bit of revisionism too.
I forgot about that.

212
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,730
The data was,
uh,

213
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,270
an interesting one that people chose to
attack because it was like,

214
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:26,790
it was so white nighty that it was,
it was like blinding.

215
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:28,710
Like you had to put sunglasses on to
read the tweets,

216
00:09:28,711 --> 00:09:29,960
like,
oh,

217
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:35,460
Christopher hitchens was a massage.
I know what he was a debater.

218
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:38,580
He loved to debate people on anything
and he knew that a very thought

219
00:09:38,581 --> 00:09:42,660
provoking subject was the idea that the
only way women are funny is if they act

220
00:09:42,661 --> 00:09:45,450
like men.
And so he wrote that Vanity Fair article

221
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:47,580
and he's a fucking genius.
Trolls.

222
00:09:47,581 --> 00:09:48,300
What he is,
he's,

223
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:52,440
he's batting around a mouse and so we
have to remember too,

224
00:09:52,441 --> 00:09:55,050
is this,
the bar for massaging is so low.

225
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:57,840
I mean like better that I've made videos
like,

226
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,200
all right,
let's just,

227
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:03,290
I believe in equality between men and
women legally and all.

228
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,320
Always,
you know,

229
00:10:04,321 --> 00:10:06,390
every opportunity man has a woman should
have.

230
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,190
Let's just get that out of the way right
off the bat.

231
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:12,860
But I think this wage gap thing is a
little wonky massage.

232
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:15,210
I just like,
yeah,

233
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:16,470
instantly.
I mean,

234
00:10:16,471 --> 00:10:19,350
you know,
I sat there and I explained to you that

235
00:10:19,351 --> 00:10:22,230
I'm just,
we have a fucking point of contention on

236
00:10:22,231 --> 00:10:23,970
an,
on an issue of economics that doesn't

237
00:10:23,971 --> 00:10:25,500
make me a fucking misogynist.

238
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:30,980
The wage gap thing is a really weird one
because people just don't want to talk

239
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:32,610
about it.
They,

240
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,511
when you say,
well,

241
00:10:33,511 --> 00:10:35,970
this wage gap thing,
the way it's been explained to me is a

242
00:10:35,971 --> 00:10:40,080
bunch of different jobs that people
pursue and the jobs that men pursue tend

243
00:10:40,081 --> 00:10:43,230
to be higher paying jobs.
Also higher risk jobs.

244
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:47,370
More men die while they're employed.
They die on the seven percent.

245
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:51,580
Some crazy number is really high,
but when you taught,

246
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:52,140
when you,
if you,

247
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,090
if you even go into that,
you can't.

248
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:56,520
Those,
those are problematic pieces of

249
00:10:56,521 --> 00:10:59,790
information because just the fact that
they exist at all,

250
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:03,690
you're attacking them like it becomes
this really weird thing where you're

251
00:11:03,691 --> 00:11:05,700
not.
You're not supposed to talk about the

252
00:11:05,701 --> 00:11:09,390
actual facts of what is happening in the
workplace.

253
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,900
So the actual numbers.
Forget about the fact that we know

254
00:11:12,901 --> 00:11:15,570
there's white bosses who were racist.

255
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,750
We know there's men who are bosses who
were sexist.

256
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,660
We know there are women who are bosses
who hate the other women in the office

257
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,390
and you fucked them over.
We know people are getting fucked over

258
00:11:24,391 --> 00:11:26,940
left and right.
We know and I think you could put it

259
00:11:26,941 --> 00:11:29,100
into a good people,
bad people thing.

260
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:30,720
I mean that's really what you're dealing
with.

261
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,360
You can call it man or women,
you can call it whatever the fuck you

262
00:11:33,361 --> 00:11:35,880
want to call it,
but it's good people and bad people and

263
00:11:35,881 --> 00:11:38,060
that's you.
As soon as you pick a side,

264
00:11:38,061 --> 00:11:41,880
it's only gender based and any
information whatsoever is unacceptable

265
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,760
and that's why.
That's why I don't like the,

266
00:11:43,761 --> 00:11:48,420
the Mras and the snake towels and shit.
It's like all you're doing is inverting

267
00:11:48,421 --> 00:11:50,490
the whole victim complex thing.
You're just saying,

268
00:11:50,491 --> 00:11:52,920
you know,
you get after them for saying we're the

269
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,160
give us special

270
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,990
privileges,
but you're just trying to flip the

271
00:11:55,991 --> 00:11:58,780
script and do the same thing from the
other end is the only place they have a

272
00:11:58,781 --> 00:12:02,590
point is financially I may have some.
I think they have some points in a child

273
00:12:02,591 --> 00:12:06,700
custody and stuff like that too.
But I mean as far as like saying that

274
00:12:06,701 --> 00:12:08,140
they're victims.
Sure.

275
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:13,630
As far as like really establishing this
idea that for whatever reason it's okay

276
00:12:13,631 --> 00:12:16,180
for a guy to get fucked over in a
relationship.

277
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,710
To the point where he loses everything
just because these two people don't want

278
00:12:20,711 --> 00:12:24,250
to be together anymore.
That that's been firmly established.

279
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:28,620
That's not part of like a systematic
society wide impression of man,

280
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:30,650
not just an issue.
It's a legal issue.

281
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:31,061
It's it.
Yeah.

282
00:12:31,061 --> 00:12:33,070
And it,
it can be taken seriously on its own.

283
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,020
You don't need an ideology to address
it.

284
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:36,730
Just like you don't need feminism to
address,

285
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,380
you know,
problems that women have,

286
00:12:38,381 --> 00:12:43,360
which I'm sure there are plenty of
feminist grievances that are well

287
00:12:43,361 --> 00:12:44,830
founded,
well thought out and shit,

288
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:47,470
but I mean they're drown out by,
you know,

289
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:50,580
the tits and video games are too big or
they're too small.

290
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,690
Like there's a famous example of this,
this,

291
00:12:52,691 --> 00:12:53,950
uh,
Anita Sarkeesian,

292
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:57,640
you know,
she was complaining about the old Tomb

293
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,400
Raider Games because Lara Croft tits
were too big.

294
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,040
And then they made them smaller.
And then she said,

295
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:06,010
oh,
well look how they're defeminized Lara

296
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:08,410
Croft to make her look more like a man.
Just,

297
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,870
you know,
it just proves that she's an unpleasable

298
00:13:10,871 --> 00:13:12,070
can.
No matter what you do,

299
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:15,400
I'm just going to find fault.
She's gonna find a fucking problem.

300
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:19,570
There's going to be people that whatever
hot button issue,

301
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,780
you know,
especially when it comes to gender,

302
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:25,210
gender is a real hot button issue.
It'd be crates like almost instant

303
00:13:25,211 --> 00:13:26,290
argument.
I don't know why.

304
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:28,180
I don't know why.
Why is it?

305
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,450
I don't know.
There's gotta be a reason there.

306
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:30,901
Yeah,
sure.

307
00:13:30,901 --> 00:13:31,990
There has to be a reason,
but I don't.

308
00:13:31,991 --> 00:13:34,060
I don't really get.
I mean I guess it's maybe just the

309
00:13:34,061 --> 00:13:36,790
history of that inequalities have
existed,

310
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,280
but I mean,
I don't know.

311
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:43,090
I don't know why people still have such
a hair trigger reaction on the gender

312
00:13:43,091 --> 00:13:46,150
thing or why it's so important because
like what's weighted?

313
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:48,370
It's weighted by the actions of the
past.

314
00:13:48,371 --> 00:13:50,860
You can't look at it as a thing that
exists in the present.

315
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:54,310
I mean even the current,
if you're a person who is being

316
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,890
victimized,
like if you're a girl is being sexually

317
00:13:56,891 --> 00:13:58,480
harassed by a boss or something like
that.

318
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:02,200
It exists in the present or whatever.
Fill in the blank with sexual

319
00:14:02,201 --> 00:14:04,420
harassment,
but it's not you and it's not me and

320
00:14:04,421 --> 00:14:07,210
we're not doing what I have in these
conversations about the wage gap when I

321
00:14:07,211 --> 00:14:08,560
was working,
when I was a teenager,

322
00:14:08,561 --> 00:14:11,470
I was working in my dad's office and
there was a woman there and she was

323
00:14:11,471 --> 00:14:15,550
perfectly attractive,
but she would make very strong like,

324
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:17,860
come on,
it's to me,

325
00:14:17,861 --> 00:14:20,020
you know,
she'd be like grabbing my ass and shit

326
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,820
and you know,
I just,

327
00:14:21,821 --> 00:14:23,920
I wasn't interested,
but you know,

328
00:14:23,921 --> 00:14:25,510
it's like when I wasn't interested,
it's like,

329
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:26,373
oh,
you know,

330
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:30,490
we think Tj is gay or something because
he didn't want that.

331
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,090
So I mean it's one thing,
at least for women,

332
00:14:34,091 --> 00:14:38,020
there's that mechanism there of like
society kind of has something built in

333
00:14:38,021 --> 00:14:40,390
to believe you if you're a victim of
sexual harassment.

334
00:14:40,391 --> 00:14:42,250
But for me it was like there was nowhere
to turn.

335
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,320
Did you feel like a victim?
I mean,

336
00:14:44,321 --> 00:14:47,110
I didn't feel like a victim because I
don't like to foster the victim

337
00:14:47,111 --> 00:14:48,640
mentality,
but I certainly felt like there was an

338
00:14:48,641 --> 00:14:51,470
issue going on in my life that I had no
ability to address.

339
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:54,110
Was she above you in the office?
Yeah.

340
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:54,861
Oh,
okay.

341
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:56,480
So that makes it weird too.
Yeah,

342
00:14:56,481 --> 00:14:57,291
she was like,
uh,

343
00:14:57,291 --> 00:15:01,110
the manager of all the people in the
call center because we'll call sand.

344
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,530
She was just a crazy lady you want and
how much fun in the office and she was.

345
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:06,860
She was pulling,
you know,

346
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,450
she was grabbing my ass.
I mean,

347
00:15:08,451 --> 00:15:09,284
Hey,
if you want,

348
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:11,150
if,
if I was into it,

349
00:15:11,151 --> 00:15:11,811
cool,
you know,

350
00:15:11,811 --> 00:15:13,280
if I reciprocated.
And I was like,

351
00:15:13,281 --> 00:15:15,620
yeah,
we've got a fun office now.

352
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,250
Right?
Because you imagine what would have

353
00:15:17,251 --> 00:15:19,130
happened when it became obvious that I
didn't like it.

354
00:15:19,131 --> 00:15:20,330
It's just like,
you know,

355
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:21,420
Oh,
why?

356
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:23,000
Why are you going to keep doing this?
Oh.

357
00:15:23,001 --> 00:15:26,030
So she kept doing it like it was,
it was a persistent pattern,

358
00:15:26,031 --> 00:15:26,990
just like,
you know,

359
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,310
day after day,
I don't know,

360
00:15:28,311 --> 00:15:29,720
probably three or four months.

361
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:33,050
Holy Shit Dude.
So every day you would go to work and

362
00:15:33,051 --> 00:15:33,890
you'd be thinking,
fuck,

363
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:37,400
this crazy lady's going to grab my ass,
and I just didn't like her.

364
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:39,110
Wow,
man.

365
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:42,080
That's not cool.
That's not cool for us.

366
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:44,680
I was so.
I was so passive than to.

367
00:15:44,681 --> 00:15:47,150
I mean I really didn't know how to say
anything.

368
00:15:47,151 --> 00:15:48,680
I got to assert yourself because you
know,

369
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:51,890
I wasn't very assertive at the time.
That's a hard spot.

370
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,800
That's a hard spot for a human being.
You know,

371
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,530
I,
I think there's a real problem when

372
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:02,420
people don't want to look at you as a
guy who's in a hard spot because you are

373
00:16:02,421 --> 00:16:03,380
a male,
right?

374
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,860
Whereas if you were a woman and you were
in that same position at the same age

375
00:16:06,861 --> 00:16:10,190
and the same awkwardness at the time,
I would feel really bad for you.

376
00:16:10,191 --> 00:16:11,480
I'd be like,
fuck man,

377
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:14,650
what an asshole that guy is,
or what an asshole that woman is.

378
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:17,270
If the woman was grabbing her ass and
she was freaking out,

379
00:16:17,271 --> 00:16:20,780
it'd be the same kind of reaction have
if you had a young girl who worked in

380
00:16:20,781 --> 00:16:24,170
the office and was a little awkward and
there was this like super aggressive

381
00:16:24,171 --> 00:16:28,010
woman who kept grabbing her ass all the
time and freaking out and it was a woman

382
00:16:28,011 --> 00:16:31,070
who was above or in the office.
That would be a really creepy scene,

383
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,320
but you don't get much sympathy for your
store.

384
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:34,490
Why would I?
Yeah.

385
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:38,270
Because there's no.
There's no social mechanism that says

386
00:16:38,271 --> 00:16:39,680
that's a problem.
Yeah.

387
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,820
It just looks like,
Oh,

388
00:16:40,821 --> 00:16:41,810
you know,
that's just some funny,

389
00:16:41,811 --> 00:16:43,460
isolated thing.
But you know,

390
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,980
when I've told that story,
I've had other people come forward and

391
00:16:45,981 --> 00:16:46,581
say like,
yeah,

392
00:16:46,581 --> 00:16:48,440
I had that problem too,
and I just didn't know what to do about

393
00:16:48,441 --> 00:16:49,910
it because you know,
if you're a man,

394
00:16:49,911 --> 00:16:54,470
you can't say I was sexually harassed,
but you know it just because you're not

395
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:58,610
interested in a particular woman who
seems to have way too much interest in

396
00:16:58,611 --> 00:16:58,820
you.

397
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:01,460
That's not reciprocated on your part.
Yeah.

398
00:17:01,461 --> 00:17:02,660
What the fuck,
man,

399
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:05,330
that's a weird.
A blind spot,

400
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,420
we have what I mean,
if you're a man,

401
00:17:08,421 --> 00:17:11,150
you're supposed to deal with it,
but that's across the board.

402
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:14,090
I mean that's like.
It's not just men that say that women

403
00:17:14,091 --> 00:17:17,360
say that to across the board,
but if you're a man you're just supposed

404
00:17:17,361 --> 00:17:19,270
to,
but that's one of my larger point is

405
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,830
that when it comes to these like
feminist and gender issues,

406
00:17:21,831 --> 00:17:26,120
it's like we're supposed to always
believe that there's a gender root cause

407
00:17:26,121 --> 00:17:28,730
to what's happening.
It can't just be that one person is

408
00:17:28,731 --> 00:17:32,420
horny for another person that doesn't
want that person back,

409
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:35,010
which can happen to anybody.
Yeah.

410
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:40,010
There's too many variables with people
to take a side based entirely on gender.

411
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:44,480
There's just too many variables.
Variables are a form of mysogeny there.

412
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:48,410
There are trigger warnings,
variables or trigger warnings and unto

413
00:17:48,411 --> 00:17:50,060
themselves I think.
I think

414
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,150
you,
you know,

415
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,510
we kind of addressed human beings as
individuals,

416
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,240
as human beings being male,
female,

417
00:17:57,241 --> 00:17:57,901
gay,
straight.

418
00:17:57,901 --> 00:18:00,330
Who gives a shit.
Let's get on a team.

419
00:18:00,331 --> 00:18:02,400
I try to do it too.
I think we all try to do it.

420
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:06,510
It's difficult when it's not being done
like universally all around us.

421
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:09,360
When I was a kid,
this is a true story.

422
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:12,750
When I moved from San Francisco to
Florida,

423
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:15,210
I was 11 years old.
Yes,

424
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:19,080
I was 11 years old.
We moved to Florida and I didn't know

425
00:18:19,081 --> 00:18:20,850
what the word nigger meant.
I didn't know.

426
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,490
I had no idea what it meant because I
lived in San Francisco.

427
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:26,580
San Francisco is super diverse in the
seventies.

428
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:30,450
This was like the Vietnam War ended when
I was in San Francisco,

429
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:35,780
so this was like hippies and fucking
people with bell bottoms and like my

430
00:18:36,601 --> 00:18:39,720
stepdad would get whistled at her when
he was with me.

431
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:44,490
It was like crazy how weird people were.
It was like a real freaky place to be

432
00:18:44,491 --> 00:18:46,860
like a young kid,
but no racism.

433
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,080
I mean,
none of that fucking never heard those

434
00:18:49,081 --> 00:18:52,710
words at school.
So then I go to Florida and I heard it

435
00:18:52,711 --> 00:18:55,020
like first day someone's calling
somebody a nigger.

436
00:18:55,021 --> 00:18:56,520
I'm like,
what the fuck is that?

437
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,930
So I didn't want to say I didn't know
because then I would look like a loser.

438
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,410
So I had to go home and I asked my mom,
she got pissed and maybe she thought I

439
00:19:04,411 --> 00:19:05,550
was playing a game.
She's like,

440
00:19:05,551 --> 00:19:07,020
you're trying to get me to say it.
I'm like,

441
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:08,220
I'm not trying to get you to say.
I like,

442
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,870
what does it mean?
She was,

443
00:19:09,871 --> 00:19:10,980
you don't know what it means.
I'm like,

444
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:13,350
you gotTa fucking tell me.
I'm like 11 years old.

445
00:19:13,351 --> 00:19:14,280
What the fuck does it mean?

446
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,180
And so she had explained to me that it
was a derogatory term for black people.

447
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,620
I was like,
what?

448
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:21,570
Like at 11,
I was like,

449
00:19:21,571 --> 00:19:22,380
what the fuck?
What,

450
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,630
what real.
Those are real.

451
00:19:24,631 --> 00:19:27,030
Like I couldn't,
I couldn't imagine it at that time.

452
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:32,360
So it is possible to grow up in a place
like maybe it was just the area that I

453
00:19:32,581 --> 00:19:37,050
was when I was young,
if we could somehow or another promote

454
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:41,730
that sort of universal look,
it doesn't make you immune to doing

455
00:19:41,731 --> 00:19:45,360
something stupid because you're gay.
It doesn't make you immune to being an

456
00:19:45,361 --> 00:19:48,990
asshole because you're a chick.
It doesn't make you immune to whatever.

457
00:19:48,991 --> 00:19:52,470
I mean fill in the blank gender wise.
Just people as individuals.

458
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:55,140
That's why I like star Trek.
Am I running for office?

459
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:59,070
That's why you like star Trek Star Trek
because you're not enough diversity.

460
00:19:59,071 --> 00:20:01,260
A lot of men run a white men running,
you know,

461
00:20:01,261 --> 00:20:03,780
there's a lot of diversity,
especially compared to,

462
00:20:03,781 --> 00:20:05,370
uh,
the shows on at the time.

463
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,950
And you know,
first interracial kiss on star Trek,

464
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:10,200
one of the first lesbian kisses on star
Trek.

465
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:11,671
Really?
Well,

466
00:20:11,671 --> 00:20:13,470
not the original series,
but on deep space nine.

467
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,070
I don't count those as well.
I did.

468
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,520
Those aren't star track.
They just stole the name,

469
00:20:17,521 --> 00:20:19,080
you know,
I don't even like the original series.

470
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:21,780
I'm sorry.
Sorry.

471
00:20:21,781 --> 00:20:23,370
I'm sorry.
I just don't.

472
00:20:23,371 --> 00:20:24,660
It's too cheesy.
It's too corny.

473
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:27,240
Goodness.
It's a time capsule though,

474
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,350
right?
Well,

475
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:29,820
yeah.
It's definitely cheesy.

476
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,040
A cheesy time.
Best forgotten.

477
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:33,480
Well,
it's become a comedy.

478
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,170
It's a comedy.
It wasn't intended it as the time.

479
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,380
No,
it was not.

480
00:20:37,381 --> 00:20:39,840
But if you watch it today,
it truly is a comedy,

481
00:20:39,841 --> 00:20:42,030
especially if there's any aliens
involved.

482
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,960
Like when Kirk Kirk had to duke it out
with that one dude with the lizard head.

483
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:47,230
Oh my God,
it's so slow.

484
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:54,580
It was a fake,
it was so fake looking like sped up the

485
00:20:54,581 --> 00:20:56,980
film or something.
At least they should have made it in the

486
00:20:56,981 --> 00:20:58,000
dark.
First of all,

487
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,040
the plan should have been total
darkness.

488
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:02,670
So the monster was like very hard to see
because see,

489
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,210
when you look at all of it,
you're like,

490
00:21:04,211 --> 00:21:07,510
what is this piece of shit you're trying
to tell me as an alien?

491
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:13,870
But my point about star trek was though
they never really talk about that kind

492
00:21:13,871 --> 00:21:14,830
of stuff.
It's not like,

493
00:21:14,831 --> 00:21:16,300
you know,
if there's a black character,

494
00:21:16,301 --> 00:21:19,720
there's no issue dealing with their
blackness,

495
00:21:19,721 --> 00:21:22,210
you know,
it's all been moved past.

496
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,130
Look at this.
Look,

497
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,950
is this real?
Oh my God.

498
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,480
Come on,
come on.

499
00:21:28,481 --> 00:21:30,760
This is real.
Oh my God,

500
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:33,100
this is so hilarious.
Oh,

501
00:21:33,101 --> 00:21:35,800
Kirk,
with a Shitty Moy Thai terrible

502
00:21:35,801 --> 00:21:38,410
technique doesn't turn his hip over.
No weight to that.

503
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,260
So this is,
um,

504
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:44,500
is it playing with sound too?
Okay.

505
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:46,870
So what we're looking at for people
listening to this.

506
00:21:46,871 --> 00:21:48,730
So I'm so sorry I haven't been
describing this.

507
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:54,030
Is Captain Kirk Duking it out with the
shittiest fucking fake looking green

508
00:21:54,401 --> 00:21:58,240
man.
Alien on this planet,

509
00:21:58,241 --> 00:22:01,480
it was like one of the cheesiest scenes
in all of Star Trek.

510
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,860
It's just so bad.
Kirk boxes is yours to get free.

511
00:22:05,861 --> 00:22:08,200
It's just,
it's everything's bad about it.

512
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:11,230
The acting is bad.
The movement is bad.

513
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:16,120
Like they're moving in slow motion.
Like when he's trying to throw punches

514
00:22:16,121 --> 00:22:18,340
at the guy.
Now Kirk is coming out with a rock.

515
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:21,000
Oh Shit.
He's got a rock and he's.

516
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:24,160
There's a closeup as he lifts it over
his head and throws it and he hits him

517
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:27,070
right in the chest and guess what?
It does nothing.

518
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,570
It just bounces off of a curse.

519
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:30,490
Like what?
Like do,

520
00:22:30,491 --> 00:22:32,830
just start walking.
That fucking thing is never going to

521
00:22:32,831 --> 00:22:35,500
catch you.
It is the slowest piece of shit of all

522
00:22:35,501 --> 00:22:36,071
time.
Yeah.

523
00:22:36,071 --> 00:22:40,570
Just stroll away leisurely and it walks
up to a big rock and that was going to

524
00:22:40,571 --> 00:22:43,990
pick up the big rock look like that
fucking piece of shit.

525
00:22:43,991 --> 00:22:48,220
Fake rock is good Lord.
So this lizard thing that literally it's

526
00:22:48,221 --> 00:22:50,860
expression does not move.
It's a child's toy.

527
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:54,760
It throws this rock at Kirk and he
barely gets out of the way.

528
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:56,250
A little too casual.
They are correct.

529
00:22:56,251 --> 00:22:59,140
If that was a real fucking rock,
you'd be shitting your pants,

530
00:22:59,141 --> 00:23:01,600
man.
That rock was within six inches of

531
00:23:01,601 --> 00:23:03,970
hitting him and tearing his arm off his
body.

532
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:06,790
Fucking goofy.
You're right.

533
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:10,550
It's too cheesy.
I hate when people are right,

534
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:13,151
you know,
at least.

535
00:23:13,151 --> 00:23:14,530
I mean,
there's some cheesy moments.

536
00:23:14,531 --> 00:23:16,180
I'm like the next generation or
something,

537
00:23:16,181 --> 00:23:17,050
but there's nothing like that.

538
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,780
I never got into it.
I never got into it because there was

539
00:23:19,781 --> 00:23:24,160
this guy named Kevin Knox who is a
hilarious comedian in Boston and he had

540
00:23:24,161 --> 00:23:26,530
this ruthless bit about,
uh,

541
00:23:26,531 --> 00:23:28,540
what the fuck did they do to the Old
Star Trek?

542
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:30,850
Wow.
Who's this fucking new captain?

543
00:23:30,851 --> 00:23:32,650
Go,
who's this new bald guy is new captain.

544
00:23:32,651 --> 00:23:36,140
He was,
he would do this long rant about like

545
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:39,250
how great captain Kirk was and how much
this guy sucks.

546
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:42,820
And out of respect,
I never watched the uh,

547
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:45,800
all right,
now at least I can.

548
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:48,980
At least I can understand the reasoning.
There was a little logic to it.

549
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:51,830
Very little,
but it's amazing how bad special effects

550
00:23:51,831 --> 00:23:53,840
were just a few decades ago.
Yeah.

551
00:23:53,841 --> 00:23:55,850
But you know,
that was a,

552
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,710
that could have been done better even in
the time,

553
00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:00,140
like you said.
I mean like shooting in the dark,

554
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,850
speed it up a little,
you know.

555
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:06,950
Well that was done in what the sixties,
seventies and it was probably either 66

556
00:24:06,951 --> 00:24:08,930
or 67 were like late sixties.
Right.

557
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:12,230
I mean you think about the great move,
I mean the hustler with Paul Newman and

558
00:24:12,231 --> 00:24:14,420
Jackie gleason.
That was just a few years before that.

559
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:16,160
That is a great move.
So they were doing great.

560
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:17,600
We saw that last year,
you know?

561
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:19,430
Oh really?
Wow.

562
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:22,670
That's great movie man.
Jackie gleason was a fucking hell of an

563
00:24:22,671 --> 00:24:25,010
actor.
It's really interesting to see his,

564
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:27,890
his career got so weird.
Like he did so many different things

565
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:32,210
going from like the honeymooners to like
doing a serious role,

566
00:24:32,211 --> 00:24:37,040
like the hustler where he wasn't funny
at all to doing smokey and the bandit,

567
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:39,950
which is like so slapsticky and
hilarious.

568
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:42,260
Smokey and the bandit holds up.
It does.

569
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,790
It holds up.
Yeah.

570
00:24:43,791 --> 00:24:45,710
My first girlfriend showed me that
movie.

571
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:48,230
I found it weird because,
you know,

572
00:24:48,231 --> 00:24:51,320
I've never really thought of sally
fields is very sexual,

573
00:24:51,321 --> 00:24:52,660
but in that movie,
you know,

574
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:54,380
I didn't like her ass.

575
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,580
It was very big.
I remember that good.

576
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:00,890
She's a sweetheart.
She was like America sweetheart.

577
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:03,150
Like a sweet woman.
Like you couldn't.

578
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:05,450
You could never see an engineer from my
generation.

579
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:08,690
The only role I really remember him
prominently if like from being a kid was

580
00:25:08,691 --> 00:25:11,270
like the mom and forrest gump and I was
like,

581
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:15,050
fuck that.
Yeah.

582
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:18,860
Sally field when she was young,
definitely had something go on.

583
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:21,710
She had a little bit of that ginger know
Maryanne,

584
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:24,200
the little bit of that.
Maryanne from Gilligan's island thing.

585
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:26,750
Yeah,
but Maryanne was considerably hotter.

586
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:31,880
I agree.
She was like pretty like pretty much had

587
00:25:31,881 --> 00:25:33,590
a girlfriend that was,
I don't know,

588
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:37,100
building is falling apart too.
We're being attacked.

589
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:40,190
I think there's people fixing something
or something.

590
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:43,220
Sorry about that.
Now UFO attack sally fields.

591
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:46,910
I'm ginger and Maryanne.
Maryanne had that thing too,

592
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:49,460
like if you think ginger is a little too
high maintenance,

593
00:25:49,461 --> 00:25:51,530
if you've known someone like her,
look what we got.

594
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:54,470
We got this girl that probably knows how
to plant things.

595
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,600
I don't know if it's a good thing or a
bad thing.

596
00:25:56,601 --> 00:25:59,150
It's probably a bad thing,
but I used to date a girl who wrote

597
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:02,570
Gilligan's island.
Erotic fan fiction does.

598
00:26:02,571 --> 00:26:04,120
Definitely not a bad thing.
Yeah,

599
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:06,500
because that's fun.
That would be a bad thing.

600
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:06,961
You know,
I,

601
00:26:06,961 --> 00:26:08,900
I don't know.
I like it because I'm like,

602
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:11,870
you know,
she can be turned on by Gilligan,

603
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,270
you know?
It seems like I'll,

604
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:15,740
I'll have an easy task of it.
Yeah.

605
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:17,090
Have you seen,
um,

606
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:20,750
there's a whole genre of bigfoot porn?
No,

607
00:26:20,751 --> 00:26:21,920
I've not seen that.
Yeah.

608
00:26:21,921 --> 00:26:24,410
There's,
there's a woman who's writing these big

609
00:26:24,411 --> 00:26:28,340
foot sexual novels would like,
and they're there.

610
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:30,470
There they're like real books,
like,

611
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:33,470
I don't know if it's in like going out
to a book,

612
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:35,420
you know,
going out to bookstores kind of thing.

613
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:37,610
That's a good question.
I know they're definitely ebooks,

614
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,140
but I'm pretty sure they're real books
too,

615
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,860
but it's bigfoot.
I'm,

616
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:44,760
I might be wrong about that.
It's big foot porn like this is.

617
00:26:44,761 --> 00:26:47,180
Here it is.
Come for bigfoot volume one.

618
00:26:47,181 --> 00:26:49,680
We'll look at that bitch.
Three and a half fucking stars.

619
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:53,490
Volume one.
Customers books one through five.

620
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:56,670
How many of these fucking books are out?
All my God.

621
00:26:56,671 --> 00:27:01,200
Scroll up so I could read this on a week
long outing in Mount Hood National

622
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,350
Forest.
What begins as a flirty fun field trip

623
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:10,650
soon turns into a nightmare when an ape
like creature kidnaps a group of teen

624
00:27:10,651 --> 00:27:12,750
girls with the purpose of procreating
with them,

625
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:18,030
thus began the erotic adventure of a
lifetime and inconceivable love story

626
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:20,910
between a young woman in her horny,
sasquatch.

627
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:24,690
Wow,
right mix of horror and erotica says

628
00:27:24,691 --> 00:27:26,550
scarlet Jones,
who is scarlet Jones?

629
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:29,340
I don't know.
She said scarlet's on the ball.

630
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:32,940
She said it's the right mix,
and so there's a bunch of these titles

631
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:36,340
come for bigfoot volume to a.
They should have had.

632
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:39,090
They could have some of this.
Another thing they didn't have to.

633
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:39,711
Oh,
this is.

634
00:27:39,711 --> 00:27:40,890
It gets even better.
Hold on.

635
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,870
Go back to school.
Make that a little larger.

636
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:44,880
Oh my God.
Look at this kid,

637
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:46,980
horny,
ape like creature said,

638
00:27:46,981 --> 00:27:48,270
Mount Hood,
national forest,

639
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:52,350
but her name is portia
for shifts.

640
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:57,590
Shelly and Leslie find themselves it'll
lusty situation as a tribe of bigfoot's

641
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,280
use.
They're willing,

642
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:03,180
willing new bio bodies to satisfy their
monster Cox.

643
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:08,480
How can porsche leave all this behind
and return to civilization when she's in

644
00:28:08,701 --> 00:28:13,230
the arms of her sasquatch,
warm and snugly and is mad at for the

645
00:28:13,231 --> 00:28:16,860
only thoughts going through her mind are
of utter bliss,

646
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:22,040
but challenges around
what the fuck,

647
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:28,850
but challenges abound for this star
crossed lovers including Leonard's head

648
00:28:28,891 --> 00:28:32,190
injury.
The guy got a head injury,

649
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:35,370
there's a male,
so they kicked up a male to male human

650
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,820
and it devastating wildfire and as sexy
forest ranger named Mike.

651
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:41,520
Oh my God,
this is hilarious.

652
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:42,530
Do you think,
you know,

653
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:44,430
they say it's hard to go black and then
go back.

654
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:46,800
Could you go big foot and go back?
Probably not.

655
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,590
Definitely not.
You'd be all stretched out.

656
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:50,453
Fucked up.

657
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:54,030
It'd be like a like a

658
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:57,660
golf pencil after that.
Yeah.

659
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:01,080
What a strange genre of Erotica.
I mean,

660
00:29:01,081 --> 00:29:04,470
I don't know if it's just this one woman
who's writing this or if there's others,

661
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:08,760
find out if there's a big foot.
Porn is an actual genre.

662
00:29:08,761 --> 00:29:12,000
Young Jamie,
when you find out how legit this

663
00:29:12,001 --> 00:29:13,350
actually is,
I mean,

664
00:29:13,351 --> 00:29:14,460
why not,
right?

665
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,560
Why not?
I mean,

666
00:29:16,561 --> 00:29:19,170
if there's bronies oh yeah,
that's true.

667
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:24,620
People jacking off to like weird
animated ponies and Shit,

668
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,720
you know,
I'll do hangouts and stuff for my

669
00:29:27,721 --> 00:29:31,680
podcast and some of the people that come
into the private hangouts or bronies,

670
00:29:31,681 --> 00:29:36,681
so I kind of get to like try to probe
their mindset and uh,

671
00:29:36,741 --> 00:29:37,171
I,
you know,

672
00:29:37,171 --> 00:29:41,280
I asked these guys like,
so do you jerk off to the all the porn

673
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:42,010
that they got out there?

674
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:42,970
They know,
you know,

675
00:29:42,971 --> 00:29:47,971
for me it's more just about fascination
to go show with a good story.

676
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:52,120
Like show with a good story.
There's plenty of shows with good

677
00:29:52,121 --> 00:29:54,700
stories that are made for adults that
don't have,

678
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:57,170
you know,
a little cute animated ponies in them.

679
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:02,560
Right.
Why would we care though?

680
00:30:02,561 --> 00:30:03,394
Really?
Right.

681
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,080
I don't give a shit.
They can do what they want.

682
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,970
Yeah.
I don't give a shit either,

683
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:10,360
but I'm not going to trust your
judgment.

684
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:11,421
Right?
You,

685
00:30:11,421 --> 00:30:13,240
you're going to like,
if someone tells you about something

686
00:30:13,241 --> 00:30:15,340
that's awesome and you know he's also a
brony.

687
00:30:15,341 --> 00:30:17,230
You're going to go,
oh,

688
00:30:17,231 --> 00:30:18,220
okay.
Thanks dude.

689
00:30:18,221 --> 00:30:19,350
Yeah,
you got to kind of weigh that out.

690
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:22,390
Yeah.
This guy says this place is cool,

691
00:30:22,391 --> 00:30:24,550
but he is a brony.
So.

692
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,473
And

693
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:30,720
if you were a brony but you hadn't
discovered brony ism and you were

694
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:34,380
missing something in your life,
you just felt like there was just a

695
00:30:34,381 --> 00:30:36,480
whole.
Would you recognize it instantly?

696
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,600
Maybe you would.
Maybe the moment you saw my little pony,

697
00:30:39,601 --> 00:30:41,460
it was just your heart would just fill
with like,

698
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:43,380
like,
like sparkles.

699
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:47,370
Everything just feels alive and
wonderful and warm for the first time

700
00:30:47,371 --> 00:30:50,610
and it's the perfect entertainment and
you watch my little pony and you just,

701
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:54,180
you get chills.
You just feel great about everything and

702
00:30:54,181 --> 00:30:55,770
you go,
this is what I've always needed.

703
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,320
I needed this.
And so you start secretly wearing my

704
00:30:58,321 --> 00:31:00,930
little pony tee shirts under your dress
shirts at work,

705
00:31:00,931 --> 00:31:04,560
and you go home and you put on my little
pony way,

706
00:31:04,561 --> 00:31:09,540
cooking yourself a lonely dinner.
But you're happy now because you

707
00:31:09,541 --> 00:31:12,360
discovered what was always missing my
little pony.

708
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:16,530
You found the missing piece for somebody
that's got to be possible mad if people

709
00:31:16,531 --> 00:31:18,210
want to be furries,
right?

710
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:23,600
If somebody wants to run around with a
chip monck mascot outfit on and like

711
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,860
furries.
You heard of the other kin?

712
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:28,050
Yes.
There are even crazier.

713
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:29,400
Yeah.
Once you describe those,

714
00:31:29,401 --> 00:31:31,050
for the people that don't know what the
fuck we're talking about,

715
00:31:31,051 --> 00:31:31,270
right?

716
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:32,490
Other 10,
prepared,

717
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:36,930
preparing mind blown folk.
If a Brownie is like someone who is

718
00:31:36,931 --> 00:31:40,110
like,
I like to pretend to be a fox,

719
00:31:40,111 --> 00:31:42,210
I wear this,
you know Fox mass.

720
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,010
Yeah.
Yeah.

721
00:31:44,011 --> 00:31:44,700
I know I'm,
I'm,

722
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:47,810
I'm just starting with furries because
it's Kinda like you were saying brony.

723
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,920
Oh sorry.
The furry,

724
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:52,570
you know.
And I like to wear a Fox mask and I like

725
00:31:52,571 --> 00:31:55,650
to gift with other furries.
That's their term for fucking.

726
00:31:55,651 --> 00:31:57,240
I don't know why they can't just use the
word fucking.

727
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,320
Yeah,
they call it riffing.

728
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:59,570
Why iff?
Yep.

729
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,620
Don't know.
Anyway,

730
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,930
so that's,
that's a furry right.

731
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:08,040
And uh,
and other kin is different but similar,

732
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:10,640
but way worse because they actually
think like,

733
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:14,880
I am a Fox and I have the soul of a Fox
within me.

734
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:17,670
And they also claim to have astral
limbs.

735
00:32:17,671 --> 00:32:21,210
Like they can feel the Fox tail.
It's not just Fox as it could be.

736
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,560
Dragons,
you know,

737
00:32:22,561 --> 00:32:25,320
they say I'm a dragon,
I have the soul of a dragon.

738
00:32:25,321 --> 00:32:28,340
I'm a reincarnated dragon.
Um,

739
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:30,180
you know,
all kinds of stuff.

740
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:31,020
Spirit,
animal,

741
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,940
they,
they even have like a fiction.

742
00:32:32,941 --> 00:32:34,320
Can they go a step further?
They,

743
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:36,540
they,
they think they somehow are characters

744
00:32:36,541 --> 00:32:39,950
from TV shows.
I even saw this post on tumbler where

745
00:32:39,951 --> 00:32:40,280
someone's

746
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:40,761
like,
you know,

747
00:32:40,761 --> 00:32:45,080
I was Joffrey from game of thrones and I
don't regret shit that I did.

748
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:50,510
You're allowed to be whatever you want.
Now.

749
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:52,070
You've got a lot of questions you
anymore.

750
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:55,130
No criticism is hate.
It is.

751
00:32:55,131 --> 00:32:55,551
And,
and,

752
00:32:55,551 --> 00:32:56,150
uh,
you know,

753
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:58,760
there's people that go around saying
they're like a laptop,

754
00:32:58,761 --> 00:33:02,790
Ken and computer can we,
things that don't even have souls to

755
00:33:02,791 --> 00:33:06,680
begin with.
Like I share a kinship with computers.

756
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:09,410
These people listed like,
Oh,

757
00:33:09,411 --> 00:33:11,690
you know,
it sucks that I have this fleshy body

758
00:33:11,691 --> 00:33:16,190
now because my true body is made of
metal because I'm an android kin.

759
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:18,830
Oh my God.
And they're serious.

760
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,630
I'm serious.
That's scary.

761
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,980
I mean it's like identity politics gone
fucking bat shit.

762
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,780
What are their preferred gender
pronouns?

763
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:29,180
Um,
I don't know if they have specific

764
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:33,440
pronouns for the each other kin,
but most of them do tend to like,

765
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:36,230
you know,
the CSI kind of shit.

766
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:40,040
I was on some websites that I was just
scrolling around looking for

767
00:33:40,041 --> 00:33:41,840
information,
looking for new stories.

768
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:47,230
And I saw a story,
I think it was on dig about how William

769
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:52,390
Shakespeare used the pronoun they for an
individual and now it's coming back.

770
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,310
You're talking about gender neutral
pronouns.

771
00:33:55,311 --> 00:33:59,750
Like William Shakespeare used it because
they talked goofy back then they had

772
00:33:59,751 --> 00:34:02,840
just invented England.
There was a bunch of shitty ways of

773
00:34:02,841 --> 00:34:04,760
describing things that we don't do
anymore.

774
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:06,530
Thou far out now.
Oh,

775
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,630
there's a bunch of stupid ways they
talked.

776
00:34:08,631 --> 00:34:09,464
We realized,
Hey,

777
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:12,830
this is a lot of extra sounds we're
making with our face and it's not

778
00:34:12,831 --> 00:34:14,960
getting the point across any better.
It's just dumb.

779
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:17,880
So let's cut the shit and let's clean
this fucking bitch out.

780
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:22,550
Modern English is the best English.
It's like they got the age gender people

781
00:34:22,551 --> 00:34:26,200
that they want everyone to say they
until they.

782
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:27,920
Until they tell you their preferred
pronoun.

783
00:34:27,921 --> 00:34:30,080
Exactly mean like you're fucking a
plural.

784
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,430
Yeah.
When there isn't a single is when you

785
00:34:31,431 --> 00:34:32,960
say they.
This is where I draw the line.

786
00:34:32,961 --> 00:34:34,640
You want to call yourself z.
Who goes why?

787
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:36,200
Mr Wiseman.
Mr. Okay,

788
00:34:36,201 --> 00:34:40,910
but not what do I give a shit?
But they would you like teaching people

789
00:34:40,911 --> 00:34:44,330
the difference is singular and plural.
Plural is they?

790
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,920
That's a bunch.
That's a few people.

791
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,620
They went to the store.
It's not a fucking guy.

792
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:49,551
Would you go,
well,

793
00:34:49,551 --> 00:34:50,900
okay,
we'll meet them at the store.

794
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,550
No,
you meet them at the store.

795
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:56,000
What the fuck you talking about?
My meeting them like how many people

796
00:34:56,001 --> 00:34:56,834
were there?
What,

797
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,540
what?
What the fuck did you just say?

798
00:34:59,541 --> 00:35:02,630
Why don't you say even assuming though
that we started using all of these

799
00:35:02,631 --> 00:35:04,580
gender pronouns,
like Howard,

800
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,990
how is anyone even going to keep that
straight?

801
00:35:05,991 --> 00:35:10,850
Like assume it catches on like wildfire
and everyone gets to choose from a list

802
00:35:10,851 --> 00:35:14,630
of like 297 genders with their own
unique sets of pronouns.

803
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:19,010
Like I can't even remember his pe.
Remember people's fucking names.

804
00:35:19,011 --> 00:35:21,650
All right.
I'm not going to remember that many

805
00:35:21,651 --> 00:35:24,980
different sets of pronouns for people.
Yeah.

806
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:28,100
It's.
I think people try really fucking hard

807
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:31,190
to define themselves because in some
way,

808
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:34,610
shape or form,
defining yourself helps you feel like

809
00:35:34,611 --> 00:35:36,950
you have at least a little bit of
sovereignty.

810
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,640
This madness

811
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:42,330
that we're all trudging through.
I think that's the most interesting

812
00:35:42,331 --> 00:35:45,570
thing about you is that you use some
weird pronouns then you're not very

813
00:35:45,571 --> 00:35:46,830
fucking interests.
That's true.

814
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:49,320
That's true.
But to those people,

815
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:52,500
it like one of the reasons why they
fight for it so viciously.

816
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:55,770
I think for a lot of like really
disenfranchised people,

817
00:35:56,100 --> 00:36:01,100
they feel so outside of any little
victory they can get even in coming up

818
00:36:02,821 --> 00:36:05,600
with a new gender pronoun that makes
them somehow another field.

819
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:08,520
But it's not a victory though,
but it is for them.

820
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,620
Maybe it's like a little tiny.
I mean,

821
00:36:10,621 --> 00:36:11,310
it's not like,
oh,

822
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:14,580
like you're not winning the war.
Maybe you win a tiny little personal

823
00:36:14,581 --> 00:36:15,271
battle,
I guess.

824
00:36:15,271 --> 00:36:15,691
You know,
like,

825
00:36:15,691 --> 00:36:16,560
yeah,
if you're in other can,

826
00:36:16,561 --> 00:36:18,420
every,
every person that gets to tell you that

827
00:36:18,421 --> 00:36:19,860
you're a dragon,
you know,

828
00:36:19,861 --> 00:36:21,000
that's just another.
Yeah,

829
00:36:21,001 --> 00:36:21,834
I'm a dragon.

830
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:24,570
But say I'm a dragon and agree I'm a
dragon.

831
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:28,260
The more true it becomes.
I think other kin is a very extreme

832
00:36:28,261 --> 00:36:30,510
example,
that extreme example.

833
00:36:30,511 --> 00:36:31,940
But I'm not into,
you know,

834
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:34,410
even like all the alternative gender
pronouns,

835
00:36:34,411 --> 00:36:36,180
you know,
and I'm cool with transgender people.

836
00:36:36,181 --> 00:36:37,380
I'm cool.
But uh,

837
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:41,430
you know,
there's not 200 genders there just isn't

838
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:42,570
going to go to that.
I want,

839
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:46,530
I want to read this.
This is Jamie just put up 2015 word of

840
00:36:46,531 --> 00:36:49,020
the year is singular.
They says,

841
00:36:49,021 --> 00:36:52,410
fucking who you can have a word of the
year,

842
00:36:52,411 --> 00:36:54,930
asshole.
If there's a reason why there's millions

843
00:36:54,931 --> 00:36:58,740
of words,
because words can only convey a portion

844
00:36:58,741 --> 00:37:01,000
of an idea.
They string them together and form

845
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:03,450
sentences.
You don't get to have a fucking word of

846
00:37:03,451 --> 00:37:06,780
the year.
That stupid shit that's really fucking

847
00:37:06,781 --> 00:37:08,870
dumb.
Maybe the word of the year should be as

848
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:13,200
dumb as using the word gay as a singular
person because that's not what it is.

849
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,640
You fucks.
Okay.

850
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:18,150
God Damn it chose pissed.
God dammit.

851
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:21,870
Look if because it's unnecessary to.
Why would she have a singular?

852
00:37:21,871 --> 00:37:25,200
They tell me Your fucking name.
Is it pat?

853
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:26,161
Okay,
Pat,

854
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:28,170
I don't know if you're a guy or girl.
I don't give a fuck.

855
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:32,220
I know I can call you pat.
They fuck you.

856
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:36,300
Fuck you.
Just fuck you.

857
00:37:36,301 --> 00:37:38,190
You're asking for too much goddamn
attention.

858
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:41,430
Stop it.
They don't.

859
00:37:41,431 --> 00:37:42,830
You think?
I think America.

860
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,960
I speak for you.
If Donald Trump speaks for most America,

861
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:48,930
I speak for everybody else.
I don't know.

862
00:37:48,931 --> 00:37:50,460
He might agree on the whole day thing
though.

863
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:53,410
You guys could probably find common
ground where,

864
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:56,280
Oh,
we'd probably find speak you speak for

865
00:37:56,281 --> 00:37:59,580
all of America there.
I think we need Donald Trump,

866
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:02,670
but we need Donald Trump on mushrooms.
That's what we need.

867
00:38:02,671 --> 00:38:05,790
We need a Donald Trump that has a bunch
of psychedelic experiences and just

868
00:38:05,791 --> 00:38:09,660
releases all this fucking aggressive
bullshit and realizes like he's in this

869
00:38:09,661 --> 00:38:12,480
unique position to maybe link
legitimately changed the world.

870
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:14,700
Can't believe you found mushrooms when
he's 65,

871
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:17,730
but now that he did,
he knows he's got to do something about

872
00:38:17,731 --> 00:38:19,860
this.
So give them shrooms and like a spear

873
00:38:19,861 --> 00:38:21,690
and set him loose in the woods.
Well,

874
00:38:21,691 --> 00:38:24,210
you know what happens is Donald Trump
has a science advisor.

875
00:38:24,211 --> 00:38:28,230
This trying to keep him alive and this
an science advisor informs him of the

876
00:38:28,231 --> 00:38:33,231
longevity properties of relaxation and
that is bound up 10 step thing.

877
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:37,810
One Way to cure this pattern or behavior
may be a breakthrough psychedelic

878
00:38:37,811 --> 00:38:40,300
experience.
So they convinced Mr. Trump to go to

879
00:38:40,301 --> 00:38:44,650
like Cedar Sinai or someplace it looks
legit and they bring them into a room

880
00:38:44,651 --> 00:38:49,390
and they dose the fuck out of him with
like 10 grams of mushrooms from Mexico.

881
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:52,380
Just
the mothership,

882
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:55,750
hieroglyphs aliens communicating with
long,

883
00:38:55,751 --> 00:39:00,751
stretchy fingers that go right to his
soul and rearrange his synapses and he

884
00:39:01,001 --> 00:39:04,030
comes out of that two hours later,
a completely different cat.

885
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:06,460
Then we got a real fucking presidential
candidate.

886
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:09,130
Then we got somebody.
But right now we've got Bernie Sanders

887
00:39:09,131 --> 00:39:12,440
and Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.
And I think Donald Trump's gonna Fuckin.

888
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:14,920
When you think he's going to win,
I don't know.

889
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:16,450
This is what I.
I don't,

890
00:39:16,451 --> 00:39:19,090
I don't know how healthy.
And this is a legit question,

891
00:39:19,091 --> 00:39:22,810
how healthy Hillary Clinton is.
Like there's been some questions about.

892
00:39:22,811 --> 00:39:26,080
Apparently she had had a concussion at
one point in time and she suffers

893
00:39:26,081 --> 00:39:28,180
postconcussion syndrome.
Maybe.

894
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:31,810
I don't know if that's true.
So it's figuring out what's true and

895
00:39:31,811 --> 00:39:34,060
what's not because everything is.
So.

896
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:39,110
It might be a rumor that you put a.
It was talking to your Jamie earlier

897
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:41,620
about a mine.
Well,

898
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,140
he's yours,
my friend Jamie,

899
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,920
Jamie,
Jamie.

900
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:48,310
I didn't want to presume,
but anyway.

901
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:50,220
No,
he was talking to him about.

902
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,270
I was talking about how there's just
like,

903
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:55,990
there's so much information now that
people can just kind of cherry pick

904
00:39:55,991 --> 00:39:57,340
whatever they want the truth to be.

905
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,421
Yeah.
You know,

906
00:39:58,421 --> 00:39:59,650
it's,
you know,

907
00:39:59,651 --> 00:40:02,260
no matter what crazy shit you believe,
you can always find someone that's

908
00:40:02,261 --> 00:40:04,540
selling that narrative.
So that's true.

909
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:07,870
Why not just go with them and say that's
the truth and everything else is a lie.

910
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:08,800
That is true.
I mean,

911
00:40:08,801 --> 00:40:12,130
you can always find support.
So it's one of the more interesting

912
00:40:12,131 --> 00:40:15,160
things about online communication.
When they ask you something,

913
00:40:15,161 --> 00:40:17,440
what would you prefer between Hillary
and trump?

914
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:20,020
That's a good question.
I don't know.

915
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:24,070
I don't know them and it's all.
It's like saying like,

916
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:27,880
who would be the better mom?
Angela Lansbury or the mom from the

917
00:40:27,881 --> 00:40:29,620
Brady bunch.
I don't fucking know those people.

918
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:30,910
I don't.
I don't know.

919
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:33,350
Who would you rather have as your mom?
I don't fucking know.

920
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:36,340
I don't know.
I think what you get when you watch

921
00:40:36,341 --> 00:40:39,010
Hillary Clinton is a fucking polished
politician,

922
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:42,310
a polished lawyer who became a
politician who was married to a

923
00:40:42,311 --> 00:40:46,210
president who's been secretary of state,
just group Frankenstein.

924
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,450
She's,
you know,

925
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:51,010
she's.
She's a deep political person.

926
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,500
She's deep.
She's deep in the system and in the

927
00:40:53,501 --> 00:40:55,960
game,
and I think we all can agree whether

928
00:40:55,961 --> 00:41:00,010
you're a republican or a Democrat,
that the game is fucking rigged.

929
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:03,490
It's rigged.
It's rigged in a bunch of real simple

930
00:41:03,491 --> 00:41:05,950
ways and a map,
a couple of them out real quick that

931
00:41:05,951 --> 00:41:10,690
everybody knows the have way too much
money that's being spent on these

932
00:41:10,691 --> 00:41:13,690
parties by gigantic corporations.
Way Too much money,

933
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:16,150
way too much influence.
It was way too much cronyism.

934
00:41:16,151 --> 00:41:19,270
There's way too many people to become
career politicians and they get

935
00:41:19,271 --> 00:41:22,270
intertwined and I rubbed my back or rub
your back.

936
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:25,170
You Rub my back and they have these
weird fucking allegiances and then they

937
00:41:25,171 --> 00:41:30,171
have parties to very clear distinct
party of Republican or a Democrat and it

938
00:41:30,641 --> 00:41:34,040
would take a fucking meteor hitting
Virginia for them

939
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,780
to elect an independent candidate.
I mean,

940
00:41:35,781 --> 00:41:39,680
it was some radical fucked up life
changing event would have to happen on

941
00:41:39,681 --> 00:41:44,120
earth where people woke up out of the
fog and realize we have to try for an

942
00:41:44,121 --> 00:41:46,820
independent party but don't yet.
But even what I was gonna say is the

943
00:41:46,821 --> 00:41:49,130
idea,
even if there's only three parties is

944
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:51,770
fucking insane.
It's insane.

945
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:55,850
The idea that you have three choices and
two of them have proven to be inept at

946
00:41:55,851 --> 00:41:59,150
managing the country over and over and
over and over and over and over again.

947
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:04,330
It's like having Walmart and like JC
Penney and they're both selling cancer

948
00:42:04,461 --> 00:42:06,680
sticks and everyone's like,
you know,

949
00:42:06,681 --> 00:42:10,700
art cancer sticks killed way less people
than their cancer sticks and then they

950
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:15,020
trade off back and forth.
One shitty fucking fast food joint

951
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:20,170
versus another Shitty fucking filling
the company Jackie fucking company

952
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:22,730
that's selling you terrible shit.
That's what the republic.

953
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:25,720
Don't you think it was at least kind of
interesting that we have,

954
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:29,290
as you know,
out of the three people who stand a

955
00:42:29,291 --> 00:42:29,861
good.
I mean,

956
00:42:29,861 --> 00:42:31,270
I guess you could put crews in there
too.

957
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:34,390
You really don't think you as an
outlier.

958
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:38,160
He's way too crazy as far as you know,
but the people who actually have a

959
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:39,430
stand,
a chance of being president,

960
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:40,121
I mean,
Hillary,

961
00:42:40,121 --> 00:42:41,980
as we've said,
is total establishment,

962
00:42:41,981 --> 00:42:43,600
whatever.
Donald trump,

963
00:42:43,601 --> 00:42:46,270
he's really not taking money from
others.

964
00:42:46,271 --> 00:42:49,240
He's mostly just using his personal
fortune at this point,

965
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:52,210
right?
Bernie Sanders is not taking money from

966
00:42:52,211 --> 00:42:54,550
super pacs.
He's just getting funded by,

967
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:57,190
you know,
a private citizens and stuff.

968
00:42:57,820 --> 00:43:01,000
So to have these people who are so
popular or people who have largely

969
00:43:01,001 --> 00:43:03,840
issued this system of,
uh,

970
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:06,730
the moneyed interests,
pumping the,

971
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,370
these political campaigns full of money
and then expecting,

972
00:43:09,371 --> 00:43:10,600
you know,
of course their,

973
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:14,140
their core values and return that,
that's,

974
00:43:14,170 --> 00:43:14,510
you know.

975
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:16,960
So it's kind of interesting that at
least we have two candidates that are

976
00:43:16,961 --> 00:43:19,450
not part of that.
It's a good point,

977
00:43:19,451 --> 00:43:23,050
or don't at least seem to be on the
surface that are,

978
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:26,560
you know,
Bernie Sanders have the second most

979
00:43:26,561 --> 00:43:29,170
popular Democrat.
He stands a pretty decent chance of

980
00:43:29,171 --> 00:43:31,510
winning A.
Donald Trump is the most popular

981
00:43:31,511 --> 00:43:33,730
republican.
He probably will get the nomination if

982
00:43:33,731 --> 00:43:37,690
Bernie Sanders just made a little bit
more sense about finances.

983
00:43:37,691 --> 00:43:42,190
I think I would be in his corner,
just don't you like there's a bunch of

984
00:43:42,191 --> 00:43:45,520
things that I do like,
let me just say what I do like I like

985
00:43:45,610 --> 00:43:50,610
what he says about having these people
that pay taxes or that I'm shelter their

986
00:43:51,581 --> 00:43:53,530
money from taxes by putting them in
foreign banks.

987
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,870
They should,
they should have to pay tax on those and

988
00:43:55,871 --> 00:43:58,090
that's bullshit.
There's tax shelters that are set up for

989
00:43:58,091 --> 00:44:01,160
corporations where a corporation makes
billions of dollars and somehow or

990
00:44:01,161 --> 00:44:02,350
another they don't pay any taxes.

991
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:04,180
That's insanity.
That all should be fixed.

992
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:04,750
That,
that.

993
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:06,280
And I agree with him 100 percent on
that.

994
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:11,640
I agree with him on a living wage and
I've had people argue with me about this

995
00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:13,960
and you know,
say that I need to talk to an economist

996
00:44:13,961 --> 00:44:18,370
and maybe they're right,
but ideologically maybe they're right

997
00:44:18,371 --> 00:44:20,410
financially,
but ideologically I think if somebody

998
00:44:20,411 --> 00:44:22,630
works for you 40 hours a week,
they should be able to eat.

999
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:25,450
They should be able to have a,
an apartment to live in.

1000
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:28,580
I mean,
you should pay someone a living wage.

1001
00:44:28,581 --> 00:44:30,280
Yeah,
a full time worker should definitely

1002
00:44:30,281 --> 00:44:32,550
have the ability to feed,

1003
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:36,600
clothe and shelter themselves.
That's seems very reasonable.

1004
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:38,010
It should be without debate,
right?

1005
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:41,670
I mean it should be.
We're talking about a person dedicating

1006
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:45,800
eight hours of every day of their life.
That's a giant chunk of money.

1007
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:46,800
Whenever,
whenever these,

1008
00:44:46,801 --> 00:44:48,750
uh,
companies crunch the numbers like

1009
00:44:48,751 --> 00:44:50,120
Mcdonald's,
they cry.

1010
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:55,160
How much would we have to raise our
prices to raise our wages to $15 an

1011
00:44:55,231 --> 00:44:57,030
hour?
It'd be something like,

1012
00:44:57,031 --> 00:44:59,640
you know,
five cents on every big Mac and shit

1013
00:44:59,641 --> 00:45:00,431
like that.
Real.

1014
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:01,980
I mean,
it's so insignificant.

1015
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:02,521
Oh,
see,

1016
00:45:02,521 --> 00:45:04,320
that's just crazy.
It's crazy.

1017
00:45:04,321 --> 00:45:05,730
They won't do that.
And you know,

1018
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:06,930
furthermore,
we've seen,

1019
00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:07,580
well,
you know,

1020
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:09,300
we're,
we're about to get a big experiment in

1021
00:45:09,301 --> 00:45:11,790
this in Seattle anyway because they're
raising the wages.

1022
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:15,420
Well,
Seattle is also in the unique position

1023
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:20,421
of being at a first year legal marijuana
sale and when that,

1024
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,290
when the taxes came into Denver,
I mean it's twisting the whole economy

1025
00:45:25,291 --> 00:45:26,460
sideways there.

1026
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:28,800
Real estate prices have gone through the
roof.

1027
00:45:29,010 --> 00:45:33,690
I think the real estate prices,
we're closing in on like 16 percent or

1028
00:45:33,691 --> 00:45:37,920
more up from the previous year when
marijuana wasn't legal there.

1029
00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:42,060
They're violent crimes kind of way down.
Drunk driving is that the lowest?

1030
00:45:42,061 --> 00:45:45,570
They've had it like 10 years.
It's fucking crazy and they've made more

1031
00:45:45,571 --> 00:45:49,740
money in taxes just in the first year
than they did an alcohol.

1032
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:51,360
That's.
That's insane.

1033
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:53,790
More money from marijuana and that state
from alcohol.

1034
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:56,370
You think about all the places that
serve alcohol.

1035
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:58,560
That's amazing.
Do you think they should take that

1036
00:45:58,561 --> 00:46:01,030
approach to some of the other drugs that
are currently illegal set?

1037
00:46:01,110 --> 00:46:03,250
One hundred percent,
especially the ones that don't kill you,

1038
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:06,750
all the ones that you make,
any exceptions or would it just across

1039
00:46:06,751 --> 00:46:09,570
the board the real problem is going to
be children.

1040
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:11,520
That's the problem.
It's a problem now.

1041
00:46:11,550 --> 00:46:14,370
It's the problem with prescription pills
that people leave around.

1042
00:46:14,371 --> 00:46:19,080
It's a problem with irresponsible folks
who leave around potentially dangerous

1043
00:46:19,081 --> 00:46:23,430
things like a prescription medication or
like a bag of mushrooms or coke or

1044
00:46:23,431 --> 00:46:24,480
something like that.
Like,

1045
00:46:24,481 --> 00:46:25,650
yeah,
that's going to be a problem,

1046
00:46:25,651 --> 00:46:27,780
man.
If you make coke legal,

1047
00:46:27,870 --> 00:46:30,660
if you make it so that you can go and
buy coke the same way you can go and buy

1048
00:46:30,661 --> 00:46:33,660
whiskey,
why not tell me why not?

1049
00:46:33,661 --> 00:46:34,770
I don't understand.
Why not.

1050
00:46:34,890 --> 00:46:37,440
If you want to tell me that alcohol
should be illegal as well,

1051
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:38,161
then I go,
yeah,

1052
00:46:38,161 --> 00:46:38,994
okay.
I get it,

1053
00:46:39,090 --> 00:46:42,240
but I bet you if you looked at coke
versus alcohol,

1054
00:46:42,241 --> 00:46:44,910
if you look at like daily use of coke
versus alcohol,

1055
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:48,120
I bet you'd see some real similar like
health problems.

1056
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:52,680
I bet if it's real similar,
I mean it might be even an alcohol might

1057
00:46:52,681 --> 00:46:53,514
lose.

1058
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:56,220
Like alcohol might be worse for you than
cocaine.

1059
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:59,370
They're both are terrible.
No one's advocating them as like a

1060
00:46:59,371 --> 00:47:02,550
health remedy,
but alcohol might be worse than coke,

1061
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,680
but we still that fucking shit
everywhere.

1062
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:06,360
Yeah.
I pretty much agree with you on that.

1063
00:47:06,810 --> 00:47:11,810
I think we need adults and children,
but let's get back to children.

1064
00:47:11,850 --> 00:47:13,170
There was something that you didn't just
say get.

1065
00:47:13,171 --> 00:47:16,610
There was things about Bernie Sanders is
a economic platform you didn't like.

1066
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:20,730
He just said a bunch of crazy shit about
marginal tax rate that he didn't think

1067
00:47:20,731 --> 00:47:25,731
the marginal tax rate is like was it
eisenhower had it at 90 percent while he

1068
00:47:25,921 --> 00:47:30,310
was in office and they asked him if a
marginal tax of 90 percent was too high

1069
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:31,490
and he said,
no.

1070
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:32,890
Now,
wow,

1071
00:47:32,891 --> 00:47:36,790
that's 90 percent.
Here's the thing about taxes and this is

1072
00:47:36,791 --> 00:47:38,890
the number one most important point.
We're talking here.

1073
00:47:39,010 --> 00:47:42,370
We're not talking about rich people.
Definitely having income equality,

1074
00:47:42,371 --> 00:47:45,240
having way too much money,
way too much influence in changing the

1075
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:48,820
laws to make it even easier for them to
protect themselves and save money.

1076
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:52,390
We're not talking about that.
We're talking about taxes and taxes are

1077
00:47:52,391 --> 00:47:55,570
sneaky because taxes go to the
government and the more money the

1078
00:47:55,571 --> 00:47:56,950
government gets,
the bigger it gets.

1079
00:47:56,951 --> 00:48:00,040
It becomes cancer.
It starts fucking growing and swelling

1080
00:48:00,041 --> 00:48:03,760
and you get bureaucracy and you get red
tape and you get a lot of bullshit.

1081
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,990
If you could ensure that the money was
going to these really enlightened people

1082
00:48:07,991 --> 00:48:11,980
who are super wise and are going to
figure out some awesome solutions to

1083
00:48:11,981 --> 00:48:16,000
reengineer our society and they make
poor people happy and well fed,

1084
00:48:16,210 --> 00:48:18,370
well then yeah,
that's a great idea,

1085
00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:20,190
but until then what you're doing is you
just.

1086
00:48:20,310 --> 00:48:25,310
You're finding successful people and
you're taking more from them like you're

1087
00:48:26,201 --> 00:48:30,970
cutting away incentive incentive.
You're cutting away this ability to get

1088
00:48:30,971 --> 00:48:32,590
to the place where you could buy an
island.

1089
00:48:32,591 --> 00:48:34,060
You're saying you shouldn't be able to
do that.

1090
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:36,940
Well,
I don't know if you can do cocaine every

1091
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:41,890
day of your life or you can bust your
ass and develop a company like Google

1092
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:44,980
and then buy a fucking island that's
also in the game.

1093
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:47,860
It's in the game.
It doesn't necessarily mean you're evil

1094
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:51,670
and this idea that because someone
figures out how to do it and I'm talking

1095
00:48:51,671 --> 00:48:54,130
about only ethically and within the
boundaries of the rules.

1096
00:48:54,310 --> 00:48:59,170
I think the issue that Bernie says that
I agree with is people that don't work

1097
00:48:59,171 --> 00:49:01,720
within the boundaries of the rules that
we all agreed on and they've figured out

1098
00:49:01,721 --> 00:49:05,620
all these sneaky fucking loopholes and
it essentially bribed politicians to

1099
00:49:05,621 --> 00:49:09,520
making it easier for them to move money
around and not pay taxes on things.

1100
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:13,350
I'm with him 100 percent on that,
but the.

1101
00:49:13,570 --> 00:49:16,690
I don't think the answer is taxing the
fuck out of people,

1102
00:49:16,930 --> 00:49:18,460
I think,
and he's going to have to tax the middle

1103
00:49:18,461 --> 00:49:20,740
class higher too.
He's admitted that when he goes over his

1104
00:49:20,741 --> 00:49:21,190
life.
Sure.

1105
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:22,650
It's crazy.
Plan you should take.

1106
00:49:22,690 --> 00:49:25,480
People don't need to be taxed more.
We need to do is figure out a

1107
00:49:25,481 --> 00:49:30,481
responsible method of managing the money
that we already fucking pay you guys.

1108
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:35,040
That's way better than taking more.
That's way better than taking more so

1109
00:49:35,310 --> 00:49:37,720
when someone says they want to see more
taxes,

1110
00:49:37,721 --> 00:49:40,150
I go,
stop with this talk.

1111
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:43,210
You're doing a shitty job of managing
all the money people are giving you

1112
00:49:43,211 --> 00:49:45,580
right now.
How about figure that out first?

1113
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:47,230
Yeah,
I mean you're definitely right and I'm

1114
00:49:47,231 --> 00:49:48,220
running for office.
Jamie,

1115
00:49:48,370 --> 00:49:50,550
you're gonna run for office,
fire it up to Jay.

1116
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:52,840
Got Me fired up.
I don't usually get this fired up about

1117
00:49:52,930 --> 00:49:54,250
something I think is a rigged game.

1118
00:49:55,790 --> 00:49:57,720
Well,
it turned progress.

1119
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:00,790
Turned you into a believer in a ways.
A little bit.

1120
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:01,960
But let me tell you this.
I mean,

1121
00:50:01,961 --> 00:50:03,070
I agree with you,
but I mean,

1122
00:50:03,071 --> 00:50:04,630
um,
you know,

1123
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:06,970
government,
I mean the government program,

1124
00:50:06,971 --> 00:50:09,580
there's definitely some government
programs that produce results and have

1125
00:50:09,581 --> 00:50:11,050
efficacy and shit.
Yes.

1126
00:50:11,270 --> 00:50:12,820
But you know,
you're right,

1127
00:50:12,821 --> 00:50:14,410
there's,
there's too much bureaucracy,

1128
00:50:14,411 --> 00:50:17,260
there's too much.
There's too many things where everything

1129
00:50:17,261 --> 00:50:19,630
is just fucking in disarray.
Like the va and Shit,

1130
00:50:19,990 --> 00:50:20,823
you know,
there's,

1131
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:24,490
there was so many files in one va
building that the building was actually

1132
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,000
collapsing,
you know,

1133
00:50:26,001 --> 00:50:28,010
just under the weight of all these files
upon

1134
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:31,110
files.
So you know,

1135
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:33,650
it,
it is kind of hard to argue that more

1136
00:50:33,651 --> 00:50:37,460
money needs to be spent when the
situation is like that.

1137
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:39,770
What's also going to the irs and the irs
is.

1138
00:50:39,771 --> 00:50:42,050
But I mean there's so many tactics
before.

1139
00:50:42,051 --> 00:50:44,750
There's so many problems though in this
country that really do need to be

1140
00:50:44,751 --> 00:50:47,810
resolved.
Like our infrastructure is shit and no

1141
00:50:47,811 --> 00:50:50,420
one wants to talk about infrastructure
because it isn't boring fucking topic.

1142
00:50:50,421 --> 00:50:53,470
No one wants to talk about the bridges
and roads crumbling and shit.

1143
00:50:53,930 --> 00:50:54,763
No,
it's good point.

1144
00:50:54,770 --> 00:50:55,730
That's a very good point.
You know,

1145
00:50:55,731 --> 00:50:58,460
the architects and engineers been
telling us for years,

1146
00:50:58,461 --> 00:50:59,031
our,
our,

1147
00:50:59,031 --> 00:51:01,190
uh,
our grades and infrastructure are

1148
00:51:01,191 --> 00:51:03,890
fucking d's and f's.
We're not doing great.

1149
00:51:04,010 --> 00:51:05,690
You know,
I grew up in Boston or costs a lot of

1150
00:51:05,691 --> 00:51:09,170
money to fix it is.
I grew up in Boston and Boston had the

1151
00:51:09,171 --> 00:51:09,920
big dig.

1152
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,480
Do you remember that?
That's also one thing I like about

1153
00:51:11,481 --> 00:51:12,314
trump.
By the way.

1154
00:51:12,970 --> 00:51:15,200
He,
that he has seems to be committed to

1155
00:51:15,201 --> 00:51:17,600
rebuilding America's infrastructure.
That's one thing I will give him.

1156
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:18,411
That is true.
Well,

1157
00:51:18,411 --> 00:51:21,110
he's,
he's going to take a radical approach

1158
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:24,040
that's different from the radical
approach of Bernie Sanders to,

1159
00:51:24,070 --> 00:51:26,150
in my opinion,
those are the two that are most

1160
00:51:26,151 --> 00:51:28,040
interesting to me.
Unless someone can prove to me that

1161
00:51:28,041 --> 00:51:30,830
Hillary Clinton is not totally healthy
and,

1162
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:32,450
and cheese.
Um,

1163
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:35,690
and that also she's not just some robot
monster.

1164
00:51:36,470 --> 00:51:39,110
That's what she is though.
She's color Schullery.

1165
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:41,510
You don't think she's interested in her?
I think she's pure.

1166
00:51:41,511 --> 00:51:43,820
I mean like I've been.
Maybe I would be interested in her if I

1167
00:51:43,821 --> 00:51:47,690
could look beneath the mask,
if I could see who she actually is the

1168
00:51:47,691 --> 00:51:52,691
person and get a sense of a human being
that resides within this completely fake

1169
00:51:53,361 --> 00:51:57,920
exterior with just to be just a place to
advocate because I kept doing it.

1170
00:51:58,010 --> 00:52:00,800
Do it.
How hard is it to be fucking Hillary

1171
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:01,880
Clinton?
It's probably brutal.

1172
00:52:01,950 --> 00:52:05,390
The scrutiny that she gets to the
constant attention,

1173
00:52:05,570 --> 00:52:09,500
the people like she probably has to put
up a wall just to get through life,

1174
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:10,550
you know?
I mean,

1175
00:52:10,550 --> 00:52:14,900
her behavior as a politician probably
mimics her behavior as a person.

1176
00:52:14,901 --> 00:52:18,140
Look at the amount of Shit Donald trump
gets about to recommend mushrooms to

1177
00:52:18,141 --> 00:52:21,810
Hillary and Donald together.
Look at Donald Trump gets one thing that

1178
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:23,990
Donald Trump.
He takes criticism way better than

1179
00:52:23,991 --> 00:52:26,540
Hillary because Donald Trump's response
to criticism is like,

1180
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:28,040
I don't give a fuck.
Fuck you.

1181
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:32,480
Right.
Hillary Clinton tries to project this

1182
00:52:32,481 --> 00:52:37,070
image of being this flawless being that
never makes a mistake,

1183
00:52:37,071 --> 00:52:39,260
and even if you think she did,
you're mistaken,

1184
00:52:39,410 --> 00:52:44,180
you're wrong to Donald Trump on
mushrooms with Mexicans in Mexico,

1185
00:52:44,210 --> 00:52:48,650
so he gets a deep love of Mexico.
I just fuck this border.

1186
00:52:48,651 --> 00:52:49,850
He just goes,
fuck this border.

1187
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:51,740
Why do we have a border?
Fuck,

1188
00:52:51,741 --> 00:52:54,080
let's just have all the same money and
no border.

1189
00:52:54,110 --> 00:52:55,630
Boom,
the gates open,

1190
00:52:56,700 --> 00:53:00,050
legalized and legalize mushrooms and
weed,

1191
00:53:00,170 --> 00:53:03,410
and you would have liked the cartel
would have zero power.

1192
00:53:03,530 --> 00:53:05,660
They would go under or they would be
significantly.

1193
00:53:05,661 --> 00:53:10,490
We wonder what the result would be of
trying to merge the dollar and the peso

1194
00:53:10,491 --> 00:53:14,540
together in norland currency.
Well,

1195
00:53:14,570 --> 00:53:17,330
white dudes were to explode all over the
country.

1196
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:20,810
You would have white,
white fat guys with like loose skin

1197
00:53:20,811 --> 00:53:24,020
screaming at the top of their lungs like
that movie scanners.

1198
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:26,390
I love that.
Why?

1199
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:29,610
If they open up the fucking borders,
oh my God,

1200
00:53:29,611 --> 00:53:31,030
it would be amazing.
It'd be.

1201
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:32,910
It'd be great.
It would be.

1202
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:34,320
It really would.
It would be great.

1203
00:53:34,321 --> 00:53:37,800
People need to stop just as long as you
don't let any Canadians in federal law.

1204
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:39,840
They would make it way more polite.

1205
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:41,910
I'll tell you what.
Are we in Canada?

1206
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,100
One of the other.
Now there's less of them,

1207
00:53:44,101 --> 00:53:46,440
so I think that we would just make them
rude,

1208
00:53:46,441 --> 00:53:49,110
obnoxious assholes like us.
Um,

1209
00:53:49,590 --> 00:53:50,371
I don't know,
man.

1210
00:53:50,371 --> 00:53:53,610
They're pretty firmly established as
nice folks.

1211
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:57,810
They are so much nicer than Americans.
I would say Canadians are 20 percent

1212
00:53:57,811 --> 00:53:58,830
nicer.
Yeah.

1213
00:53:59,310 --> 00:53:59,791
I've,
uh,

1214
00:53:59,791 --> 00:54:01,620
I've met some Canadians,
so I would agree.

1215
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:03,870
It's weird.
They're strange country though.

1216
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:08,340
When you first go waiting,
like going from Boston to Montreal.

1217
00:54:08,430 --> 00:54:10,980
I'm waiting for like the true people to
come out.

1218
00:54:10,981 --> 00:54:13,290
My can we,
you guys are in the cold to how come

1219
00:54:13,291 --> 00:54:17,340
you're not a bunch of evil cunt like me.
You can find mean people everywhere.

1220
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:18,570
Sure.
But the difference between the way

1221
00:54:18,571 --> 00:54:22,050
people behaved in Montreal versus the
way people behaved in Boston,

1222
00:54:22,051 --> 00:54:22,950
I was like,
oh,

1223
00:54:23,310 --> 00:54:24,570
how weird.
Well,

1224
00:54:24,571 --> 00:54:27,060
Boston's like very aggressive.

1225
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:28,740
Yeah,
it's like known for that.

1226
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,260
Yeah.
It's boat people.

1227
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:35,370
People that came over on boats drunk.
They crashed their 200 years ago.

1228
00:54:35,371 --> 00:54:37,890
They stayed and they fuck they had kids
ruined their lives.

1229
00:54:37,891 --> 00:54:40,410
They had kids ruin their lives and now
here they are right now,

1230
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:43,050
a few,
four or five generations later,

1231
00:54:43,170 --> 00:54:45,120
maybe three.
I should point out that,

1232
00:54:45,121 --> 00:54:48,390
um,
the Boston accent is one of the most

1233
00:54:49,110 --> 00:54:51,900
horrible sounds to my ears.
It's disgusting.

1234
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:55,920
It's really wretched.
I had one for awhile because I was uh,

1235
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:57,390
you know,
when I moved to,

1236
00:54:57,391 --> 00:54:58,530
um,
hear it anymore,

1237
00:54:58,531 --> 00:55:02,520
but I hear it occasionally if I have a
couple of drinks,

1238
00:55:03,170 --> 00:55:07,530
a word will come out.
But I heard myself a talk once and I was

1239
00:55:07,531 --> 00:55:08,364
like,
what?

1240
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:10,800
I heard like a recording and I was like,
what the fuck?

1241
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:14,130
That's what I sound like.
I didn't realize I sounded like that.

1242
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:19,020
So I made a concerted effort to stop
speaking like that where could really

1243
00:55:19,021 --> 00:55:23,160
hard and had oh,
stop things that they all talk like

1244
00:55:23,161 --> 00:55:25,110
that.
It's a monsters.

1245
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:28,530
Don't do it,
but it's fun.

1246
00:55:28,650 --> 00:55:30,650
I'll tell you what though.
It's funny when it comes out of

1247
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:32,190
comedian,
I'll tell you what though.

1248
00:55:32,191 --> 00:55:35,130
I'm my,
my southern accent will come out if I'm

1249
00:55:35,131 --> 00:55:39,480
angry or I'm really drunk.
Yeah.

1250
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:43,020
Got To just do y'all,
did y'all ever come out of your mouth?

1251
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:44,310
Oh yeah.
I'll say y'all.

1252
00:55:44,311 --> 00:55:48,810
Even even without speaking in a southern
southern affectation,

1253
00:55:48,811 --> 00:55:51,410
I'll still use y'all because I think.
Yeah,

1254
00:55:51,450 --> 00:55:54,090
I actually will make an argument for
y'all because you know,

1255
00:55:54,091 --> 00:55:56,070
it is actually easier than it's,
it's,

1256
00:55:56,071 --> 00:55:57,690
it's a,
it's a legitimate contraction.

1257
00:55:57,691 --> 00:55:58,950
You all,
y'all,

1258
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:01,560
I mean know there's no a in in you,
but whatever.

1259
00:56:01,590 --> 00:56:06,000
You know what I like to know y'all,
it seems to buy pasta all.

1260
00:56:06,150 --> 00:56:09,240
It seems to be almost always friendly.
It is like,

1261
00:56:09,270 --> 00:56:11,340
you know,
y'all gonna get killed.

1262
00:56:12,090 --> 00:56:14,820
That's not even in that context.
It sounds friendly.

1263
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,920
Fucked up.
I guess you could say it like that,

1264
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:19,140
but it's like,
but it's more like what y'all doing,

1265
00:56:19,470 --> 00:56:22,110
you know,
like everybody's like casual.

1266
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:23,080
It's a casual word.
Well,

1267
00:56:23,081 --> 00:56:25,030
it's the difference between the black
and the white.

1268
00:56:25,031 --> 00:56:26,330
Y'All,
you know,

1269
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:28,240
what are you doing?
Getting racist here and a little bit,

1270
00:56:29,170 --> 00:56:31,360
just a Smidgen.
Listen,

1271
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:34,320
if there are any differences between
black people and white people,

1272
00:56:34,330 --> 00:56:37,390
I'd like you to not address those
because those in faculty be

1273
00:56:37,391 --> 00:56:39,580
microaggressions.
Well,

1274
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:42,430
do you not know about microaggression?
I do know about microaggressions.

1275
00:56:42,431 --> 00:56:43,360
I mean,
it's a white male.

1276
00:56:43,361 --> 00:56:45,190
You're a walking microaggressions.
True.

1277
00:56:45,191 --> 00:56:46,510
It's true.
How dare you.

1278
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:50,610
But you know,
black dudes have bigger dicks so they

1279
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:52,240
don't ever know.
They don't object to that one.

1280
00:56:52,250 --> 00:56:55,050
That is microaggression.
Black men,

1281
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:57,430
they never backed black men that are
like,

1282
00:56:57,431 --> 00:57:00,220
they have that expectation.
What if white men or white women,

1283
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:03,970
either one only go out with them because
they expect the big black Dick and

1284
00:57:03,971 --> 00:57:05,200
meanwhile these guys,
they,

1285
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:08,230
they dread,
they live in fear of the moment.

1286
00:57:08,231 --> 00:57:09,860
They have to put out their normal cock.
Well,

1287
00:57:09,861 --> 00:57:11,830
all they gotta do is when they whip it
out and be like,

1288
00:57:11,831 --> 00:57:14,530
surprise bitch,
that'll work.

1289
00:57:14,531 --> 00:57:17,980
Once it will work,
it'll work more than once.

1290
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:20,260
We'll work on different people,
but you're going to have to get to that

1291
00:57:20,261 --> 00:57:22,690
position over and over and over again.
That's the hardest position.

1292
00:57:22,691 --> 00:57:25,480
I guess you'll just have to get by on
personality or something.

1293
00:57:26,950 --> 00:57:28,210
Boy,
you're asking a lot.

1294
00:57:31,570 --> 00:57:34,720
I have to do it.
I'm not working with much.

1295
00:57:34,930 --> 00:57:36,820
How did you start making these youtube
videos?

1296
00:57:37,330 --> 00:57:38,350
Um,
well,

1297
00:57:38,351 --> 00:57:38,981
you know,
it's funny,

1298
00:57:38,981 --> 00:57:40,570
I was,
I was there,

1299
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:44,500
I was there from almost the beginning.
I'm the one of the few people that still

1300
00:57:44,770 --> 00:57:46,870
from the old youtube because when did
you start?

1301
00:57:47,170 --> 00:57:48,850
Uh,
nine years ago.

1302
00:57:48,910 --> 00:57:50,620
Wow.
Two thousand seven.

1303
00:57:50,621 --> 00:57:52,690
Two Thousand and eight Christ.
That's how long youtube tube's been

1304
00:57:52,691 --> 00:57:53,290
around.
Yeah.

1305
00:57:53,290 --> 00:57:54,430
While,
and,

1306
00:57:54,580 --> 00:57:57,910
but I mean it's not that long at all.
Yeah.

1307
00:57:58,180 --> 00:58:00,430
Well to me it seems like a really long
time.

1308
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:03,010
That's a,
you know,

1309
00:58:03,011 --> 00:58:05,770
I think it started in 2006 or something,
so I wasn't there from the very

1310
00:58:05,771 --> 00:58:09,040
beginning.
But everyone who was big at the time,

1311
00:58:09,850 --> 00:58:12,070
I don't think any of them are big now.
I think they're all gone.

1312
00:58:12,730 --> 00:58:16,570
So I mean it seems like the shelf life
of a youtube channel is pretty short,

1313
00:58:16,571 --> 00:58:18,880
so I'm glad I've been around this entire
time.

1314
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:20,950
Yeah.
But I mean I guess I just started

1315
00:58:20,951 --> 00:58:23,890
because I went on there,
I was already being like a fucking

1316
00:58:23,891 --> 00:58:28,420
asshole atheist troll to people in like
Internet forums and stuff.

1317
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:31,510
So a bunch of people,
they like the way I wrote,

1318
00:58:31,810 --> 00:58:33,640
they told me I should take my,
you know,

1319
00:58:33,641 --> 00:58:35,680
I should take it on youtube and I was
Kinda like,

1320
00:58:35,710 --> 00:58:36,670
Eh,
I don't know,

1321
00:58:37,150 --> 00:58:40,030
I don't really feel like I have much of
a camera presence or whatever,

1322
00:58:40,031 --> 00:58:40,830
but I,
I,

1323
00:58:40,830 --> 00:58:45,280
I went on youtube and I made a horrible,
horrible fucking video that is just

1324
00:58:45,281 --> 00:58:47,460
wretched in every way.
And you know,

1325
00:58:47,850 --> 00:58:52,810
I walk around my garage talking in this
monotone voice like this,

1326
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:56,420
but for some reason some people liked it
and uh,

1327
00:58:56,710 --> 00:58:59,920
I kept doing it and I got a little bit
more natural in front of the camera as I

1328
00:58:59,921 --> 00:59:01,180
stopped treating it.
Like,

1329
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:04,030
I dunno,
I started treating it more like a person

1330
00:59:04,031 --> 00:59:06,240
or a friend.
And uh,

1331
00:59:06,570 --> 00:59:08,020
over time it just,
I don't know,

1332
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:11,320
I've never been like the biggest channel
on youtube or anything,

1333
00:59:11,321 --> 00:59:13,660
but it's just always been consistently
successful.

1334
00:59:13,661 --> 00:59:18,310
Consistently grows consistently,
seems to keep pace with,

1335
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:21,040
you know,
whatever the standard of being on the

1336
00:59:21,050 --> 00:59:21,980
lower end of the

1337
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:24,860
popularity scale of youtube is.
Well,

1338
00:59:24,861 --> 00:59:28,520
I feel like youtube in particular,
it's one of those things where if you do

1339
00:59:28,521 --> 00:59:32,390
a show like yours,
what's really important is consistency.

1340
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:36,170
You've got to do it a lot so that people
get addicted to it and you also just

1341
00:59:36,171 --> 00:59:38,720
have to put a lot of effort into it.
And those are two things that you do,

1342
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:40,400
you know,
you're really consistent,

1343
00:59:40,401 --> 00:59:44,420
you put a lot of videos and I try,
you obviously have like really well

1344
00:59:44,421 --> 00:59:48,010
thought out points of view in these
things and you argue them well and,

1345
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:50,150
and in a funny way,
you know,

1346
00:59:50,151 --> 00:59:54,710
and that's kind of interesting that
before youtube and before the Internet I

1347
00:59:54,711 --> 00:59:57,440
got like,
you would have struggled to find a

1348
00:59:57,441 --> 01:00:00,140
forum,
like if you wanted to go to some

1349
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:01,970
television production company and go,
Hey,

1350
01:00:01,971 --> 01:00:03,670
my name's Tj,
you know,

1351
01:00:03,671 --> 01:00:06,560
I live in Blah Blah Blah,
and I'm but thinking about doing this

1352
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:09,860
thing where I just fucking turn a camera
on me and I just say what I feel about

1353
01:00:09,861 --> 01:00:11,090
shit.
Like yeah,

1354
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:12,830
that sounds great tj.
Get the fuck Outta here.

1355
01:00:12,831 --> 01:00:14,450
Get outta here man.
And watch that piece of shit.

1356
01:00:14,530 --> 01:00:16,980
We know how many millions of views do
you have on your Youtube Channel?

1357
01:00:16,990 --> 01:00:18,920
High average.
Four to 5 million views a month.

1358
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:23,090
Yeah.
Fucked up NBC.

1359
01:00:23,510 --> 01:00:25,640
You fucked up.
I could have got four or $5 million

1360
01:00:25,641 --> 01:00:27,410
views a month.
What are you doing instead?

1361
01:00:27,590 --> 01:00:28,700
What do you got instead?
Huh?

1362
01:00:28,790 --> 01:00:31,790
What kind of bullshit.
And you sell in America right now.

1363
01:00:32,190 --> 01:00:33,023
But you know,
the,

1364
01:00:33,270 --> 01:00:35,820
the weird thing about the whole youtube
thing is though,

1365
01:00:37,010 --> 01:00:39,870
I mean I have two successful channels
now.

1366
01:00:39,871 --> 01:00:42,570
I have the amazing atheist channel,
which is the older channel.

1367
01:00:42,571 --> 01:00:44,760
I have the drunken peasants,
a podcast channel.

1368
01:00:44,761 --> 01:00:47,770
I'm doing kind of what you were doing.
Um,

1369
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:51,030
and that's doing well.
That's only a couple of years old,

1370
01:00:52,830 --> 01:00:54,390
but you know,
I was thinking if,

1371
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:55,830
if,
if it weren't for Youtube,

1372
01:00:55,831 --> 01:01:00,540
I mean before when I was a kid,
I used to want to either be a writer and

1373
01:01:00,541 --> 01:01:03,660
really it was writing that Kinda got me
into doing youtube anyway because I was

1374
01:01:03,661 --> 01:01:06,450
just like a forum troll that would argue
with people on the Internet.

1375
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,490
I had no fucking life.
Right?

1376
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:10,530
Um,
well because it's exciting.

1377
01:01:10,620 --> 01:01:12,630
It's fun,
it's fun for me and I like pushing

1378
01:01:12,631 --> 01:01:14,010
buttons.
It pissing people off,

1379
01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:15,960
you know,
I'll say things just to piss people off.

1380
01:01:15,990 --> 01:01:16,950
Of course,
you know,

1381
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:19,220
and um,
you know,

1382
01:01:19,230 --> 01:01:21,330
I do that.
I mean I guess that probably I would've

1383
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:23,130
had to try to be a comedian or
something,

1384
01:01:23,131 --> 01:01:25,580
but when you were there in the day with
flame wars,

1385
01:01:25,620 --> 01:01:28,980
I wouldn't want to be a comedian though
because I don't want to have to always

1386
01:01:28,981 --> 01:01:30,570
be funny.
I don't want to feel pressure.

1387
01:01:30,571 --> 01:01:32,910
Like everything I say has to be a
fucking joke,

1388
01:01:32,911 --> 01:01:35,400
you know?
Well it only does on stage,

1389
01:01:35,670 --> 01:01:36,690
you know,
I know that.

1390
01:01:36,691 --> 01:01:38,320
But I mean I,
I don't want the,

1391
01:01:38,610 --> 01:01:43,060
I don't want people to think that the
performance has to be about laughter or

1392
01:01:43,620 --> 01:01:47,100
whatever you're producing,
whether it's a song of the cast stuff.

1393
01:01:47,101 --> 01:01:48,580
I try to be funny.
Another thing though is,

1394
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:50,190
you know,
it's a lot harder to gauge whether

1395
01:01:50,191 --> 01:01:52,890
people are finding it funny or not
because you know,

1396
01:01:52,891 --> 01:01:56,190
I don't have a live reaction to what I'm
saying.

1397
01:01:56,191 --> 01:01:58,380
So sometimes some shit that I think is
really funny,

1398
01:01:58,381 --> 01:02:00,810
people would be like,
this video was cringe or something,

1399
01:02:00,811 --> 01:02:01,381
you know?
I'm like,

1400
01:02:01,381 --> 01:02:02,670
Oh fuck,
I guess I will.

1401
01:02:02,671 --> 01:02:05,100
That's always going to be.
The king wasn't as funny as I thought I

1402
01:02:05,101 --> 01:02:07,530
bombed.
While you're also dealing with a.

1403
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:11,250
what's the sample group?
What percentage of people leave

1404
01:02:11,251 --> 01:02:12,690
comments?
Is it even one?

1405
01:02:13,110 --> 01:02:16,530
It might not even be one tiny.
It's a tiny in that sample.

1406
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:18,720
It's a tiny percentage of people that
write the videos.

1407
01:02:18,721 --> 01:02:20,010
It's a percentage of people that

1408
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:23,310
comment on the videos.
Most people they just watched.

1409
01:02:23,311 --> 01:02:25,140
They don't interact in any way
whatsoever,

1410
01:02:25,141 --> 01:02:26,730
so it's impossible to know what they
think,

1411
01:02:26,790 --> 01:02:28,830
but you know,
they keep coming back so they must see

1412
01:02:28,831 --> 01:02:29,664
something.
They're like,

1413
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:32,370
well,
and the people that are fine,

1414
01:02:32,371 --> 01:02:34,470
like the one thing you said that piss
them off,

1415
01:02:34,471 --> 01:02:35,790
that makes them go on this rant about
it.

1416
01:02:35,791 --> 01:02:37,380
You should die in the fucking car
accident.

1417
01:02:37,710 --> 01:02:41,040
Those those people,
like you're missing the whole point of

1418
01:02:41,041 --> 01:02:44,520
what one of these things is like if you
have a different point of view,

1419
01:02:44,790 --> 01:02:49,320
you should establish your own channel
and you should go fucking make your own

1420
01:02:49,321 --> 01:02:51,900
videos about it man,
and if you can even link to them in a

1421
01:02:51,901 --> 01:02:53,310
reply video,
you could say,

1422
01:02:53,570 --> 01:02:56,430
you know,
fuck face made a reply to Tj and you

1423
01:02:56,431 --> 01:02:57,690
know,
this is what I think about you and your

1424
01:02:57,691 --> 01:03:00,420
fucking shitty atheists ideas and when
Jesus does come back,

1425
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:02,280
make a video man,
make a video.

1426
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:06,350
And that's the interesting thing about
today is that someone can do that.

1427
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:08,040
Well,
the problem is they try and no one

1428
01:03:08,041 --> 01:03:09,030
cares.
Yeah,

1429
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:12,540
well it's way easier to critique than it
is to do obviously.

1430
01:03:12,630 --> 01:03:15,510
Yeah,
it's very easy to sit there and say

1431
01:03:15,511 --> 01:03:17,250
you're an idiot and everything you do is
wrong.

1432
01:03:17,670 --> 01:03:20,670
To actually do what I do and be
successful at it,

1433
01:03:21,220 --> 01:03:23,790
it's a little harder.
The problem is like to really critique

1434
01:03:23,791 --> 01:03:25,410
someone.
If someone's critiquing someone,

1435
01:03:25,411 --> 01:03:29,910
I can read their words and I can try to
think if make it make sense to me and it

1436
01:03:29,911 --> 01:03:33,060
might make sense,
but I don't know them and that is,

1437
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:37,380
that is a problem because if I don't
know them or I don't know their work,

1438
01:03:37,430 --> 01:03:41,430
like if they're an artist,
like I say Michael Stipe or someone like

1439
01:03:41,431 --> 01:03:44,430
that from rem writes something about
someone,

1440
01:03:44,431 --> 01:03:45,264
I go,
hmm,

1441
01:03:45,330 --> 01:03:48,030
well he seems to be a weird,
interesting Kinda guy.

1442
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:51,000
I wonder if I would agree with his
opinions on things and wonder if his

1443
01:03:51,001 --> 01:03:52,200
perspective is skewed.
What?

1444
01:03:52,201 --> 01:03:55,470
What does it do?
His words represent honesty or is there

1445
01:03:55,471 --> 01:03:58,380
some sort of emotional imbalance that
he's a who?

1446
01:03:58,430 --> 01:03:59,250
What is,
what does that,

1447
01:03:59,250 --> 01:04:01,920
what is actually going on?
Unless you know someone,

1448
01:04:02,070 --> 01:04:03,080
it's hard.
Why?

1449
01:04:03,110 --> 01:04:06,060
Like why is he getting mad at the
amazing atheist?

1450
01:04:06,090 --> 01:04:08,880
What is what's going on?
Which I wish more people would think

1451
01:04:08,881 --> 01:04:11,190
like that.
I'm like,

1452
01:04:11,191 --> 01:04:13,290
why is he so angry at you?
Why?

1453
01:04:13,291 --> 01:04:15,340
Why?
Why is he threatening you?

1454
01:04:15,341 --> 01:04:19,440
Why you freak out?
People don't get mad about ideas that

1455
01:04:19,441 --> 01:04:21,900
they think are wrong.
They get afraid of ideas they think

1456
01:04:21,901 --> 01:04:23,700
might be right.
That's a big part of it.

1457
01:04:23,701 --> 01:04:24,090
You know,
and,

1458
01:04:24,090 --> 01:04:25,980
and when you,
when I'm someone who will come out there

1459
01:04:25,981 --> 01:04:30,540
and just brazenly say that someone's
most deeply cherished beliefs are just

1460
01:04:30,541 --> 01:04:32,700
wrong and stupid,
you know,

1461
01:04:32,701 --> 01:04:33,900
of course people are getting upset.

1462
01:04:34,230 --> 01:04:35,850
Of course people are going to have the
reaction of,

1463
01:04:35,851 --> 01:04:37,050
Oh my God,
this guy,

1464
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:38,850
he's obnoxious.
He's an asshole.

1465
01:04:38,851 --> 01:04:40,500
He's an idiot.
Which all might be true,

1466
01:04:40,770 --> 01:04:44,040
but I still don't think there's a god.
Um,

1467
01:04:44,490 --> 01:04:48,000
do you think there's no god or do not
believe in God?

1468
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:49,410
I don't think we even got.
Yeah,

1469
01:04:49,411 --> 01:04:50,910
I think there's a difference.
Right?

1470
01:04:51,110 --> 01:04:55,650
So you don't have a thing and let people
go with WHO's not you fucking more.

1471
01:04:55,651 --> 01:04:56,760
You're atheist.
Bullshit.

1472
01:04:56,930 --> 01:04:59,250
Let's just,
let's just follow me for a second here.

1473
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:02,640
I think there's one thing if you believe
in God,

1474
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:04,170
okay.
If you believe in God,

1475
01:05:04,171 --> 01:05:06,190
you are essentially,
you're,

1476
01:05:06,230 --> 01:05:08,580
you're believing in something that you
have no evidence of.

1477
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:11,250
There's no proof of it.
There's no direction that points to it.

1478
01:05:11,460 --> 01:05:13,860
There's certainly some weird stuff going
on in the universe.

1479
01:05:13,950 --> 01:05:17,590
The Universe is fascinating,
matter itself is a wonderful.

1480
01:05:17,590 --> 01:05:19,090
It's amazing.
It's incredible,

1481
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:22,000
incomprehensible,
incomprehensible and infinite,

1482
01:05:22,030 --> 01:05:26,410
right?
But believing in something that you have

1483
01:05:26,411 --> 01:05:30,460
no evidence is very different than not
believing in something because when you

1484
01:05:30,461 --> 01:05:33,910
say you don't believe in God,
it doesn't mean that there's no god,

1485
01:05:34,570 --> 01:05:36,430
but there's no evidence of it
whatsoever.

1486
01:05:36,431 --> 01:05:40,900
I've never seen anything like if you and
I die and we're in heaven and I'm like,

1487
01:05:40,901 --> 01:05:42,580
Tj,
can you fucking believe this shit?

1488
01:05:42,581 --> 01:05:43,810
Be like,
Holy Shit,

1489
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:47,290
we were so stupid.
High Five,

1490
01:05:47,590 --> 01:05:48,430
you know?
I mean,

1491
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:52,960
if there is a wonderful,
beautiful God that's all about love and

1492
01:05:52,961 --> 01:05:54,070
created the universe,
by the way,

1493
01:05:54,220 --> 01:05:57,190
he's going to know that you didn't know
and he's not going to be mad at you.

1494
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:59,350
That's like a friend not knowing when
you're.

1495
01:05:59,351 --> 01:06:02,170
You don't know where they're from.
You don't know when their birthday is,

1496
01:06:02,350 --> 01:06:05,320
so they come over your house and beat
the fuck out of you because you didn't

1497
01:06:05,321 --> 01:06:06,160
say happy birthday.

1498
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:06,791
He's like,
dude,

1499
01:06:06,791 --> 01:06:08,710
I didn't know you didn't tell me.
Well,

1500
01:06:08,711 --> 01:06:09,410
that's what.
What?

1501
01:06:09,410 --> 01:06:12,220
By God not being here to tell us all
this stuff.

1502
01:06:12,890 --> 01:06:16,080
Most people,
most people think that God is a is a

1503
01:06:16,090 --> 01:06:16,781
dick.
I mean,

1504
01:06:16,781 --> 01:06:19,540
most people who believe in God,
they called themselves God fearing,

1505
01:06:19,541 --> 01:06:20,374
you know,
they don't.

1506
01:06:20,650 --> 01:06:22,690
I'm sure there are.
There are people who preach about a god

1507
01:06:22,691 --> 01:06:24,430
of love and forgiveness and all this
shit,

1508
01:06:24,431 --> 01:06:28,840
but most of these people preach about a
God that expects you to blindly believe

1509
01:06:28,841 --> 01:06:33,340
in him or suffer eternal torment forever
in hell and be tortured.

1510
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:36,310
It's nonsense,
but we don't know what happens when we

1511
01:06:36,311 --> 01:06:38,320
die.
It's really that simple.

1512
01:06:38,321 --> 01:06:43,321
It could be just like a DMT trip.
It could be like a completely new DMT is

1513
01:06:43,601 --> 01:06:46,040
released in the brain when people die.
Yeah.

1514
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:48,910
During moments of heavy stress when your
body feels like it's going to die.

1515
01:06:49,190 --> 01:06:50,220
Um,
and we,

1516
01:06:50,221 --> 01:06:52,420
we even know now,
thanks to the work of this guy,

1517
01:06:52,450 --> 01:06:56,380
Dr Rick Strassman who wrote that book,
the spirit molecule spirit molecule.

1518
01:06:56,410 --> 01:06:57,880
It's amazing.
He wrote,

1519
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:01,000
he,
they did these clinical trials out of

1520
01:07:01,001 --> 01:07:03,460
the University of New Mexico and he
documented it in this book or they're

1521
01:07:03,461 --> 01:07:07,000
administering DMT intravenously,
really fucking wild shit.

1522
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:10,110
But he's got this thing called the
cottonwood research foundation where

1523
01:07:10,111 --> 01:07:15,111
they're trying to do more dmt studies
and one of the things they've found is

1524
01:07:15,431 --> 01:07:20,431
that they've isolated one of these
universities that mice produce dmt in

1525
01:07:20,891 --> 01:07:24,580
their pineal gland.
Like that is a fact now.

1526
01:07:24,730 --> 01:07:27,520
Whereas before it was just anecdotal
evidence that pointed to that.

1527
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:30,070
So like the seed of the soul,
the third,

1528
01:07:30,071 --> 01:07:31,650
I like all that.
Like the,

1529
01:07:31,670 --> 01:07:35,230
this gland in the center of your brain
really is the DMT factory,

1530
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:38,320
which is what you know,
ancient people have been saying forever.

1531
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:40,510
I mean that's the third eye from eastern
mysticism.

1532
01:07:40,511 --> 01:07:42,220
That is,
that's what it represents.

1533
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:47,700
So that is supposedly what we release
our brain releases when we die,

1534
01:07:48,220 --> 01:07:52,180
which is really amazing if you stop and
think about it or if you've had a dmt

1535
01:07:52,181 --> 01:07:54,350
trip,
but it might not even be that about

1536
01:07:54,370 --> 01:07:56,800
this.
That might be just the doorway that gets

1537
01:07:56,801 --> 01:08:00,280
you to diapers and all of a sudden you
wake up and you're a fucking baby again.

1538
01:08:00,281 --> 01:08:03,670
You got to do this shit all over again.
You got to live as Tj and you've got to

1539
01:08:03,671 --> 01:08:06,880
do the same fucking life.
Your parents make the same moves.

1540
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,190
Your Dad,
mom gets a voice at the same time.

1541
01:08:09,191 --> 01:08:11,330
This,
this is like a Nietzschean ideal of

1542
01:08:11,710 --> 01:08:14,380
eternal recurrence.
Why not?

1543
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:15,940
If existence kid

1544
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:18,500
can be real.
If the hold on a second,

1545
01:08:18,501 --> 01:08:23,150
if these actual distance of us talking,
sitting here know airplanes landing,

1546
01:08:23,151 --> 01:08:26,270
all these things take place.
Why can't it take place in an infinite

1547
01:08:26,271 --> 01:08:27,440
number of times?
It could,

1548
01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:28,610
you know,
but that's kind of,

1549
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:31,190
that's kind of a,
the one of the most compelling arguments

1550
01:08:31,191 --> 01:08:34,640
to live an interesting life if you're
going to have to actually go through it

1551
01:08:34,641 --> 01:08:39,530
over and over and over again in exactly
the same fashion with nothing different

1552
01:08:39,830 --> 01:08:42,050
or not.
Or maybe you do get to change,

1553
01:08:42,051 --> 01:08:44,480
I don't know.
But that concept of living the same life

1554
01:08:44,481 --> 01:08:47,660
over and over again is um,
that's been around a long time.

1555
01:08:47,661 --> 01:08:49,880
But actually a word for it,
full disclosure though,

1556
01:08:49,881 --> 01:08:52,220
my belief is generally that when I'm,
when I'm dead,

1557
01:08:52,221 --> 01:08:54,860
I'm just going to blink out of
existence.

1558
01:08:54,890 --> 01:08:55,910
But why do you believe that?

1559
01:08:56,450 --> 01:08:59,000
I just don't understand you believing
that you don't have any information,

1560
01:08:59,300 --> 01:09:01,310
but I couldn't understand you believe in
result.

1561
01:09:01,340 --> 01:09:05,090
The reason I believe that is because I
think that my consciousness has seated

1562
01:09:05,091 --> 01:09:10,091
within my brain and that my brain is
unique to this time and place,

1563
01:09:11,361 --> 01:09:14,570
and that even if it were to be recreated
identically,

1564
01:09:15,350 --> 01:09:16,460
you know,
right next to me,

1565
01:09:16,461 --> 01:09:18,200
that still wouldn't be me because
there's,

1566
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:21,230
there's still a separation there.
You're not a clone of yourself.

1567
01:09:21,860 --> 01:09:23,180
I think that,
you know,

1568
01:09:23,181 --> 01:09:24,690
uh,
but I,

1569
01:09:24,700 --> 01:09:27,350
I kind of try to live in the eternal
presence,

1570
01:09:27,380 --> 01:09:28,310
you know,
just,

1571
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:31,290
that's good.
That's smart.

1572
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:33,590
I don't believe in a,
I don't believe.

1573
01:09:33,591 --> 01:09:34,400
I think that,
you know,

1574
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:38,540
if you were to pull out a gun and shoot
me in the head that it would be the end

1575
01:09:38,541 --> 01:09:40,730
of my existence.
I would never form another thought.

1576
01:09:40,731 --> 01:09:42,260
I would never have another experience.

1577
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:45,350
I can't prove that though.
It's totally just what I believe.

1578
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:47,990
It's totally possible that you're right,
it's,

1579
01:09:48,230 --> 01:09:53,230
but it's also compelling the idea that
what the brain is is the universe

1580
01:09:54,140 --> 01:09:58,880
finding a way to imagine itself in a
physical three dimensional form.

1581
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:03,140
That's what the brand represents and
that this dimension that we exist in

1582
01:10:03,141 --> 01:10:07,850
right now,
solid things is just one of an infinite

1583
01:10:07,851 --> 01:10:12,650
number of possibilities that exist all
throughout the cosmos and that what

1584
01:10:12,651 --> 01:10:17,600
we're experiencing right now is the
body,

1585
01:10:17,750 --> 01:10:22,370
the physical embodiment of life,
multicellular structures coming together

1586
01:10:22,580 --> 01:10:25,820
and forming these coalitions,
which is essentially what your body is,

1587
01:10:25,821 --> 01:10:27,110
right?
There's all this bacteria and all this

1588
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:31,100
different shit that's going on and then
it has to take in life foods and enzymes

1589
01:10:31,101 --> 01:10:36,101
and creates this environment,
this in its most advanced form,

1590
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:40,130
at least as far as its ability to
manipulate your house right now.

1591
01:10:40,610 --> 01:10:42,550
Have you ever heard Howard blooms the
frames or.

1592
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:43,730
I'll forget it.
Okay,

1593
01:10:43,860 --> 01:10:45,170
good.
What did I say?

1594
01:10:46,010 --> 01:10:47,300
Fuck,
sorry.

1595
01:10:47,570 --> 01:10:48,080
But,
uh,

1596
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:52,190
you're talking about a lot of stuff that
my friend Howard Bloom has written about

1597
01:10:52,700 --> 01:10:57,680
in a book he wrote called the global
brain that basically talks about exactly

1598
01:10:57,681 --> 01:11:00,640
that coalescence of,
you know,

1599
01:11:00,650 --> 01:11:05,100
a single bacteria to a biofilm,
a bacterial colonies,

1600
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:08,570
to an organism,
to organisms getting together and

1601
01:11:08,571 --> 01:11:10,220
forming societies.
And you know,

1602
01:11:10,221 --> 01:11:11,570
it's,
it's all about how,

1603
01:11:12,380 --> 01:11:12,990
you know,
we,

1604
01:11:12,990 --> 01:11:13,490
we,
we're,

1605
01:11:13,490 --> 01:11:17,520
we're climbing this ladder of
connectivity and you know,

1606
01:11:18,060 --> 01:11:19,920
like Los Angeles is a good example at
you.

1607
01:11:19,921 --> 01:11:24,480
You kind of likened it in a video I saw
of yours to the mold eating the

1608
01:11:24,481 --> 01:11:25,560
sandwich,
you know,

1609
01:11:25,790 --> 01:11:27,810
we're,
we're kind of that force because

1610
01:11:27,811 --> 01:11:32,811
humanity is like a super organism and
we've built this crazy large society

1611
01:11:33,331 --> 01:11:36,510
that no other ape species on the planet
has been able to come close to.

1612
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:41,730
Well that was the concept was that it's
all moving towards this ultimate goal of

1613
01:11:41,731 --> 01:11:43,380
things being more and more complex.
Right?

1614
01:11:43,530 --> 01:11:44,610
Well,
while that's happening,

1615
01:11:45,030 --> 01:11:48,090
the brain,
which is what the human uses to go

1616
01:11:48,091 --> 01:11:53,091
through this experience could have been
created like over time and through all

1617
01:11:54,481 --> 01:11:57,590
these advancements for,
for the universal sort of experiencing

1618
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:01,320
itself for the universe to imagine
itself and what we're doing as these

1619
01:12:01,321 --> 01:12:04,070
weird organisms that changed things as
we're,

1620
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:05,700
we're,
we're designing something,

1621
01:12:05,701 --> 01:12:09,240
we're building towards something.
There's no question that if things

1622
01:12:09,241 --> 01:12:13,740
continue to get more and more complex,
which we are fucking starving for,

1623
01:12:13,980 --> 01:12:16,950
we're constantly thirsty for new
inventions.

1624
01:12:17,070 --> 01:12:19,740
Innovation.
That's what everybody wants and no one

1625
01:12:19,741 --> 01:12:22,410
wants like a static world.
No one says,

1626
01:12:22,411 --> 01:12:24,210
hey,
everything we have right now

1627
01:12:24,211 --> 01:12:27,510
technologically is perfect.
We need to stop spending money on

1628
01:12:27,511 --> 01:12:30,060
research and inventions.
Let's just have joy.

1629
01:12:30,060 --> 01:12:32,820
All the shit we have and just be nice to
each other.

1630
01:12:32,850 --> 01:12:34,830
That's not what we're interested in at
all.

1631
01:12:35,570 --> 01:12:37,520
But so if you look at us objectively,
if you like,

1632
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:39,960
pull back and go,
what is this thing doing?

1633
01:12:40,290 --> 01:12:44,280
Like what is this thing doing?
This thing is constantly getting better

1634
01:12:44,281 --> 01:12:49,281
at getting closer together and it by
combining people and electronics,

1635
01:12:50,140 --> 01:12:54,930
combining people and technology.
I mean the dinosaurs could have had that

1636
01:12:54,931 --> 01:12:56,550
perspective though,
like yeah man,

1637
01:12:56,551 --> 01:12:59,730
we're built into like bigger and better
dinosaurs one day.

1638
01:12:59,731 --> 01:13:03,690
It's just going to be the biggest
ultimate dinosaur that rules the

1639
01:13:03,691 --> 01:13:05,040
universe or something.
You know?

1640
01:13:05,041 --> 01:13:06,360
Instead they went extinct.
Yeah,

1641
01:13:06,361 --> 01:13:09,560
but they got hit with a rock cheating.
If you fire like it's cheating.

1642
01:13:09,580 --> 01:13:12,810
If you find like a cannon ball,
I mean if it's going up and up and up,

1643
01:13:12,811 --> 01:13:15,930
you might make the mistake of saying
this is always going to go up and up and

1644
01:13:15,931 --> 01:13:16,980
up and then,
you know,

1645
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:18,780
eventually gravity catches up with it.

1646
01:13:19,150 --> 01:13:23,340
I just don't think we could take it for
granted that we have some sort of great

1647
01:13:23,341 --> 01:13:25,710
destiny on the horizon.
I think,

1648
01:13:25,711 --> 01:13:27,540
you know,
it's up to us to make that happen,

1649
01:13:27,780 --> 01:13:29,430
but I don't think we can take it for
granted.

1650
01:13:29,670 --> 01:13:30,420
Oh,
definitely not.

1651
01:13:30,420 --> 01:13:32,800
No one's suggesting that definitely
can't.

1652
01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:35,280
I don't think it has to work out.
Look,

1653
01:13:35,490 --> 01:13:38,190
here's a fucking gigantic super volcano
under yellowstone.

1654
01:13:38,420 --> 01:13:42,270
Could easily blow up and killed.
Basically everybody on the continent as

1655
01:13:42,420 --> 01:13:44,880
close to it.
That fucker blows.

1656
01:13:45,060 --> 01:13:47,350
This is a global extinction event.
I mean this,

1657
01:13:47,351 --> 01:13:49,320
this.
Could they think that that one that blue

1658
01:13:49,321 --> 01:13:54,321
was at in Indonesia,
chop the human race down to just a few

1659
01:13:54,390 --> 01:13:57,060
thousand people 70,000 years ago.
They think it might have been as few as

1660
01:13:57,061 --> 01:13:58,350
2000 people left.
Well,

1661
01:13:58,351 --> 01:14:01,560
the real detriment is the clouds
blocking out the sun.

1662
01:14:01,590 --> 01:14:02,880
Exactly.
Lack of food.

1663
01:14:03,330 --> 01:14:05,370
Photosynthesis.
No vegetables,

1664
01:14:05,371 --> 01:14:08,070
fucking serious climate change,
very,

1665
01:14:08,071 --> 01:14:09,140
very drastic,
very,

1666
01:14:09,141 --> 01:14:11,220
very cold,
real cold,

1667
01:14:11,230 --> 01:14:14,020
real quick,
no food and a lot of people are going to

1668
01:14:14,021 --> 01:14:15,280
die of sickness and illness.

1669
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:17,830
Yeah,
it's a super volcano.

1670
01:14:17,831 --> 01:14:20,800
Could fuck up everything and then that's
the argument that a lot of people have

1671
01:14:20,801 --> 01:14:25,180
made as far as people that have looked
to try to revise those current model of

1672
01:14:25,181 --> 01:14:28,660
history based on cataclysmic events like
look back and say,

1673
01:14:28,661 --> 01:14:29,201
well,
you know,

1674
01:14:29,201 --> 01:14:31,660
there's a lot of these cultures that
created these incredible stone

1675
01:14:31,661 --> 01:14:34,480
structures.
Like maybe they died off because some

1676
01:14:34,481 --> 01:14:37,660
shit happened like he couldn't get.
It might not have just been disease.

1677
01:14:37,661 --> 01:14:40,660
There might be like a series of media
impacts.

1678
01:14:40,740 --> 01:14:42,880
Super volcanoes,
all sorts of different.

1679
01:14:43,570 --> 01:14:46,960
There's like shit that can happen to
this world all the time.

1680
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:49,720
California is due for an earthquake at
any moment.

1681
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:53,950
This we can be sitting here doing this
podcast and any moment a nine kid hit

1682
01:14:54,100 --> 01:14:59,080
and half a fucking Malibu could slide
right into the ocean and waves a hundred

1683
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:01,660
feet high can just roll three,
four miles in.

1684
01:15:01,810 --> 01:15:03,550
At least.
It'd be an interesting episode.

1685
01:15:04,150 --> 01:15:06,160
It would be a dope podcasts,
but I think,

1686
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:07,780
well,
we figured we need a battery.

1687
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:11,230
Joe Rogan goes screaming into the abyss
of the earth.

1688
01:15:11,260 --> 01:15:14,290
We need a battery backup.
We're strategically far away from the,

1689
01:15:14,291 --> 01:15:16,250
uh,
from the ocean for that reason.

1690
01:15:16,251 --> 01:15:16,750
Oh,
you're saying,

1691
01:15:16,750 --> 01:15:18,040
okay,
you've thought of this.

1692
01:15:18,041 --> 01:15:20,320
You've planned.
I had been thinking about setting up

1693
01:15:20,321 --> 01:15:21,760
shop in downtown La.
Man.

1694
01:15:21,761 --> 01:15:26,050
I have this weird compelling notion to
try to get to downtown La and set

1695
01:15:26,051 --> 01:15:28,900
something up in there like put,
put together a studio in downtown.

1696
01:15:29,170 --> 01:15:31,090
It just seems like a spot to go to right
now.

1697
01:15:31,210 --> 01:15:35,050
Like I'm drawn to it like the ring,
you know what I'm saying?

1698
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:36,210
Ring of power.
Yeah.

1699
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:39,280
Well which are on,
was using it for

1700
01:15:42,460 --> 01:15:43,360
something about,
uh,

1701
01:15:43,390 --> 01:15:46,060
going there.
But that's a high enough to have a good

1702
01:15:46,061 --> 01:15:49,810
vantage point to see the waves come in
and know that you can't get it out of

1703
01:15:49,811 --> 01:15:50,560
the way.

1704
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:52,840
And I don't know,
I just don't plan for stuff like that.

1705
01:15:52,841 --> 01:15:54,310
I figured if I'm gonna die,
I'm gonna die.

1706
01:15:54,311 --> 01:15:59,311
I'm not going to try to avert some
unlikely fate of the tsunami waves.

1707
01:16:00,311 --> 01:16:00,701
I mean,
you know,

1708
01:16:00,701 --> 01:16:02,320
I figured like if that's what's going to
kill me,

1709
01:16:02,620 --> 01:16:04,960
I'll just stand out there and I'll look
at them and I'll be like,

1710
01:16:04,990 --> 01:16:06,610
alright,
embrace me.

1711
01:16:06,650 --> 01:16:07,780
Death.
Right.

1712
01:16:07,781 --> 01:16:10,180
Like the final scene of deep impact.
Yeah.

1713
01:16:10,181 --> 01:16:11,690
You know,
just fucking like.

1714
01:16:11,710 --> 01:16:13,840
Except that shit.
Don't be trying to.

1715
01:16:14,050 --> 01:16:16,290
Fuck.
I'm going to watch from above is all the

1716
01:16:16,300 --> 01:16:19,240
fucking stupid people drown.
Told you it was going to happen.

1717
01:16:19,241 --> 01:16:22,030
You morons will.
That would be a lot like walking dead,

1718
01:16:22,060 --> 01:16:23,170
right?
Yeah.

1719
01:16:23,430 --> 01:16:25,870
Like the,
the people that are free are the people

1720
01:16:25,871 --> 01:16:28,630
that are dead.
The people that are trapped in this

1721
01:16:28,631 --> 01:16:31,510
shitty world surrounded by flesh eating
monsters.

1722
01:16:31,810 --> 01:16:33,310
Those are the people that are alive.

1723
01:16:33,370 --> 01:16:35,920
The of live fucked up.
That's why they did that whole like play

1724
01:16:35,921 --> 01:16:37,750
on words with that one episode where
he's like,

1725
01:16:37,751 --> 01:16:39,610
we are the walking dead,
you know?

1726
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,850
Oh yeah.
I see a twisted it around.

1727
01:16:42,860 --> 01:16:47,150
Subverted expectation was fleshed out
that no,

1728
01:16:47,290 --> 01:16:48,970
I pretended it didn't happen.
It happened.

1729
01:16:49,030 --> 01:16:51,370
It was beautiful.
Do you watch the new walking dead?

1730
01:16:51,460 --> 01:16:52,870
No.
It's really fucking good.

1731
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:55,930
Is it because I heard bad things?
How dare those people?

1732
01:16:55,931 --> 01:16:58,090
Those people suck and those people don't
know shit.

1733
01:16:58,990 --> 01:17:02,830
I'm addicted to that show and I know
that sometimes it's pretty hokey and

1734
01:17:02,831 --> 01:17:04,360
cheesy,
but I do like it.

1735
01:17:04,660 --> 01:17:06,070
I like it too.
I liked both of them,

1736
01:17:06,610 --> 01:17:10,700
but the new one is way more like a movie
or way more like maybe a netflix show.

1737
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:13,670
Whereas the old ones seems like an NBC
show.

1738
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:15,890
Yes.
I love about the walking dead is that

1739
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:18,380
every episode is just like,
what?

1740
01:17:18,380 --> 01:17:21,240
Miserable Shit.
We're all characters go through next and

1741
01:17:21,241 --> 01:17:23,840
then it's just like misery,
executive object,

1742
01:17:23,841 --> 01:17:25,340
fucking horror,
terror.

1743
01:17:25,341 --> 01:17:27,860
Just no moment of goodness.
And even if there is,

1744
01:17:27,861 --> 01:17:30,300
it's just so it can be taken away,
you know,

1745
01:17:30,950 --> 01:17:32,660
and you know,
that kind of makes people feel better

1746
01:17:32,661 --> 01:17:34,250
about their,
their actual lives I think.

1747
01:17:34,251 --> 01:17:37,940
I think a lot of the sjw types around
the Internet need to get into that show.

1748
01:17:37,941 --> 01:17:42,941
So people who have a real life,
it's a social justice warrior.

1749
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:47,170
It's what he's referring to when he says
asj w dot m r a.

1750
01:17:47,180 --> 01:17:49,520
that's not one said really.
Anyone on the Internet knows what I'm

1751
01:17:49,521 --> 01:17:51,680
talking about,
but there's a lot of people that are not

1752
01:17:51,681 --> 01:17:53,300
on the Internet.
They're just getting this podcast.

1753
01:17:53,301 --> 01:17:54,740
We have to help them.
Lucky them.

1754
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:55,830
We have to help them.
I don't want it.

1755
01:17:55,900 --> 01:17:59,900
If they don't know what a fucking sjws
don't do them the disservice of telling

1756
01:17:59,901 --> 01:18:02,960
them what you said Mra earlier,
which allowed people's rights,

1757
01:18:02,961 --> 01:18:04,910
activist or advocate.
Right.

1758
01:18:05,260 --> 01:18:07,240
I guess it can be advocate to.
I've always heard activists,

1759
01:18:07,300 --> 01:18:12,050
but it basically means like men are
oppressed in America.

1760
01:18:12,051 --> 01:18:13,640
It's both.
It's like,

1761
01:18:13,700 --> 01:18:15,260
oh my God,
shut up.

1762
01:18:16,820 --> 01:18:19,970
Yeah.
It's not a good position to be in,

1763
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:21,313
but

1764
01:18:22,260 --> 01:18:23,093
we,
we,

1765
01:18:23,340 --> 01:18:25,360
we discussed their valid thing.
It's easy.

1766
01:18:25,430 --> 01:18:28,530
It's easy to mock.
It's easy to mock it up.

1767
01:18:28,790 --> 01:18:29,850
Exactly.
But what that was,

1768
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:30,550
you know,
uh,

1769
01:18:30,550 --> 01:18:32,400
my,
my whole point was like,

1770
01:18:32,430 --> 01:18:37,170
a men's rights activist would want to
support you when you were being sexually

1771
01:18:37,171 --> 01:18:39,630
harassed by that super horny.
Maybe you're right.

1772
01:18:39,780 --> 01:18:42,390
Maybe I'm biting the hand.
They should potentially feed.

1773
01:18:42,391 --> 01:18:44,220
Called a couple friends.
Had A fucking gang.

1774
01:18:44,221 --> 01:18:45,360
Bang.
That crazy bitch.

1775
01:18:45,390 --> 01:18:46,680
That's what you should've done.
She's like,

1776
01:18:46,690 --> 01:18:47,523
you all right.
You want to fuck,

1777
01:18:47,970 --> 01:18:51,270
here's some guys that are down to fuck
with wish she'd be like to kind of grow.

1778
01:18:51,271 --> 01:18:55,290
Whereas those weird fucking stockings
connected with rubber bands for some

1779
01:18:55,291 --> 01:18:57,630
reason.
Why is that hot when they have the

1780
01:18:57,631 --> 01:19:00,630
stocking and it's got like strap and
like you've got a harness and shit like

1781
01:19:00,631 --> 01:19:02,250
you're ready to go.
Fucking parasailing.

1782
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:05,010
Like why?
Why is that hot?

1783
01:19:05,011 --> 01:19:06,360
Those.
What are those called?

1784
01:19:06,390 --> 01:19:09,530
Garter straps.
Are Gardeners started or something?

1785
01:19:10,050 --> 01:19:11,700
What the fuck is that?
Why is that hot?

1786
01:19:12,810 --> 01:19:14,910
Because that's what you're dirty boss
would have.

1787
01:19:15,070 --> 01:19:18,030
That's what she would have those,
you just see it in a lot of movies and

1788
01:19:18,031 --> 01:19:19,070
shit too.
You know why?

1789
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:22,560
Because that way they can fuck without
taking their panties down because their

1790
01:19:22,561 --> 01:19:26,270
panties only go up to like mid high.
And then above that it's all just meat

1791
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:29,790
almost.
I was uh,

1792
01:19:30,250 --> 01:19:32,090
you know,
there was probably a racist reasons why

1793
01:19:32,091 --> 01:19:33,660
I didn't want to get with her too.
She wasn't,

1794
01:19:33,710 --> 01:19:34,920
she's black and she's,
Oh,

1795
01:19:34,921 --> 01:19:36,410
well you're a racist.
Dare you.

1796
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:37,820
That's the real.
That's the real problem here.

1797
01:19:38,180 --> 01:19:40,910
God Damn it.
You have a lot of problems.

1798
01:19:40,911 --> 01:19:42,470
I know I'm just,
I'm racist,

1799
01:19:42,471 --> 01:19:44,510
I'm sexist.
I'm just a horrible person.

1800
01:19:45,070 --> 01:19:46,490
Um,
if she was white,

1801
01:19:46,670 --> 01:19:48,470
you think you'd fuck her?
Maybe.

1802
01:19:48,620 --> 01:19:49,600
Wow.
Damn.

1803
01:19:50,580 --> 01:19:52,310
I know you're not allowed to have that
preference.

1804
01:19:52,790 --> 01:19:54,500
I'll just let you know.
That's racist.

1805
01:19:54,530 --> 01:19:56,600
Well,
I like Brazilian girls better than white

1806
01:19:56,601 --> 01:19:59,900
girls.
Too Racist to maybe she moved to Brazil.

1807
01:20:00,170 --> 01:20:03,020
Maybe should get the fuck out of my own
because I don't like crushing poverty

1808
01:20:03,021 --> 01:20:03,770
either.
So.

1809
01:20:03,770 --> 01:20:06,110
Oh well.
Maybe you can go over there and find a

1810
01:20:06,111 --> 01:20:06,990
nice gal.
Yeah.

1811
01:20:07,170 --> 01:20:09,510
And treat her for the wonderful life
that you live on.

1812
01:20:09,660 --> 01:20:10,920
Being a youtube star.
Yeah,

1813
01:20:10,921 --> 01:20:12,610
we can do that.
Do you ever like go back and forth with

1814
01:20:12,611 --> 01:20:14,850
any girls from there that are desperate
to leave now?

1815
01:20:16,170 --> 01:20:18,930
I'm not.
I'm not suave enough for that endeavor.

1816
01:20:19,110 --> 01:20:24,110
If this woman was like a really hot,
like stone cold Russian lady and she

1817
01:20:24,541 --> 01:20:25,201
kept grabbing.
Yeah.

1818
01:20:25,201 --> 01:20:29,520
I was thinking I should know just like
really sexy but strong.

1819
01:20:29,550 --> 01:20:31,790
A kind of scary but still really.
Okay.

1820
01:20:32,140 --> 01:20:33,570
I'm talking about you're talking about
like,

1821
01:20:33,571 --> 01:20:35,790
uh,
like that chick from rocky for.

1822
01:20:36,290 --> 01:20:40,800
Yeah.
Who still owned while up Marion diddy.

1823
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:42,480
He married her.
Bridgette Nielsen?

1824
01:20:42,540 --> 01:20:45,240
Yeah.
She was a fucking giant Uber woman.

1825
01:20:45,330 --> 01:20:46,210
Yeah.
I like that.

1826
01:20:46,460 --> 01:20:46,980
Yeah,
I do.

1827
01:20:46,980 --> 01:20:48,370
Yeah,
that's exactly what I'm talking.

1828
01:20:48,390 --> 01:20:49,470
Things would have played out
differently.

1829
01:20:49,471 --> 01:20:51,780
Totally different.
It's just not in the blank checks,

1830
01:20:51,781 --> 01:20:53,580
but that's okay.
I am now.

1831
01:20:53,581 --> 01:20:54,870
Just not then.
Well,

1832
01:20:54,871 --> 01:20:55,770
you know what man?

1833
01:20:55,860 --> 01:20:59,790
Why is it a bad thing to not be sexually
into whatever.

1834
01:20:59,940 --> 01:21:02,430
I don't like meat.
Maybe it'd be like you don't like skinny

1835
01:21:02,431 --> 01:21:04,020
women.
You don't like tall women.

1836
01:21:04,140 --> 01:21:06,060
You don't like short.
It's not a preference issue.

1837
01:21:06,061 --> 01:21:10,680
Like are you allowed to say sexually you
you're not attracted to black women or a

1838
01:21:10,681 --> 01:21:12,630
black man.
Are you allowed to say that or is that

1839
01:21:12,631 --> 01:21:14,040
racist?
It's racist.

1840
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:15,810
That's weird.
It's considered racist.

1841
01:21:15,850 --> 01:21:20,160
It's only about sex as a thing.
If you're a lover as a human being.

1842
01:21:20,161 --> 01:21:24,300
If you go to the SJ W,
which our audiences just learned what

1843
01:21:24,301 --> 01:21:25,740
that means,
circles,

1844
01:21:26,310 --> 01:21:30,870
then it's racist.
If you're in the MRA circles than it's

1845
01:21:30,900 --> 01:21:33,870
not so raised,
then I'm on their side now among them

1846
01:21:33,900 --> 01:21:37,710
that I will admit it's easier to take
their side,

1847
01:21:37,770 --> 01:21:40,470
but I still just think there's too much
of this.

1848
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:43,080
I'm a victim.
Feel sorry for me.

1849
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:45,240
Give me special rights.
Give me special privileges.

1850
01:21:45,241 --> 01:21:47,880
I just tired of that line.
I mean,

1851
01:21:47,881 --> 01:21:50,160
look,
we had people that were oppressed groups

1852
01:21:50,161 --> 01:21:52,350
in America for a long time.
No one denies it,

1853
01:21:52,770 --> 01:21:54,060
but I mean,
is that really still the case?

1854
01:21:54,061 --> 01:21:56,270
Like she'll give me.
I always asked feminists,

1855
01:21:56,271 --> 01:21:59,190
like,
tell me an objective objectively

1856
01:21:59,191 --> 01:22:00,600
provable,
right?

1857
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:03,990
Give me a right that I have that you
don't have.

1858
01:22:03,991 --> 01:22:05,790
And it's just silence.
Like,

1859
01:22:06,290 --> 01:22:07,610
well,
uh,

1860
01:22:08,020 --> 01:22:10,180
you know,
oh,

1861
01:22:10,380 --> 01:22:12,780
what about the wage gap?
Wage gap.

1862
01:22:12,810 --> 01:22:13,860
There's no,
there's no right.

1863
01:22:13,870 --> 01:22:17,880
There's lots,
but don't just don't remember though.

1864
01:22:17,881 --> 01:22:19,410
Like there was a wage gap.
You know,

1865
01:22:19,411 --> 01:22:23,220
you already know this.
Somebody wrote this down and just don't

1866
01:22:23,250 --> 01:22:25,080
say it.
The wage gap is real.

1867
01:22:25,081 --> 01:22:25,914
Guys.
Just

1868
01:22:27,930 --> 01:22:29,720
stop that space.
You know what?

1869
01:22:29,790 --> 01:22:31,800
Can't argue with those facts.
I've done some research,

1870
01:22:31,801 --> 01:22:36,801
I've discovered that in certain
industries there are wage gaps,

1871
01:22:37,140 --> 01:22:39,480
there are individual wage gaps in
certain industries.

1872
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:42,690
Like what industries are our primary.
I don't remember off the top of my head.

1873
01:22:42,691 --> 01:22:44,580
I think a real estate and stuff like
that,

1874
01:22:44,581 --> 01:22:48,590
but I mean that could in real estate's a
weird one though because it kind of

1875
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:51,880
depends on how successful you are at it.
You know,

1876
01:22:51,881 --> 01:22:53,850
it's,
it's not like you're going in and doing

1877
01:22:53,851 --> 01:22:55,950
a nine to five and get into fucking
salary.

1878
01:22:56,280 --> 01:23:00,390
I know a dude who bought a house and the
girl who was selling the house was hot

1879
01:23:00,630 --> 01:23:04,440
and he was a single guy and he showed up
at the house and this bitch was in the

1880
01:23:04,470 --> 01:23:06,040
tub naked.

1881
01:23:06,910 --> 01:23:09,760
That's one way to sell a house.
There used to be able to do that in the

1882
01:23:09,761 --> 01:23:12,880
early two thousands.
My friend for fucking social media

1883
01:23:12,881 --> 01:23:14,250
ruined that party.
You know,

1884
01:23:14,260 --> 01:23:17,170
he'll blow her shit on facebook and ruin
her life.

1885
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:19,510
She's just trying to get freaky and sell
a house.

1886
01:23:19,511 --> 01:23:21,910
Maybe get some Dick,
catch some of that loose dick.

1887
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:24,580
This float around when you're a hot real
estate agent,

1888
01:23:26,380 --> 01:23:29,620
why not?
I want to share levels or no bubbles.

1889
01:23:29,621 --> 01:23:32,950
I envisioned bubbles.
Bubbles is bubbles is the move.

1890
01:23:33,070 --> 01:23:34,810
Yeah,
but it's pretty gangster to go fucking

1891
01:23:34,811 --> 01:23:35,644
straight,
naked.

1892
01:23:36,270 --> 01:23:39,220
Clear in native.
I think it's better if there's bubbles

1893
01:23:39,221 --> 01:23:43,340
because then she stands up and then the
bubbles kind of run down her body,

1894
01:23:43,341 --> 01:23:44,060
you know?
Well,

1895
01:23:44,060 --> 01:23:46,630
then also might be a decision of whether
or not she could become your woman.

1896
01:23:47,470 --> 01:23:49,990
Like she could be your girlfriend or
your wife if she has bubbles.

1897
01:23:49,990 --> 01:23:52,240
Like this pitch just loved me and she
took a chance.

1898
01:23:52,241 --> 01:23:55,450
She's crazy.
We went for it and now she's so fun and

1899
01:23:55,451 --> 01:23:56,740
spontaneous.
We get along great,

1900
01:23:56,950 --> 01:24:00,370
but if you show up and she's just cudi
ass naked,

1901
01:24:00,371 --> 01:24:02,290
he wouldn't be like,
this bitch is crazy.

1902
01:24:02,470 --> 01:24:04,240
I gotta get Outta here.
I can't buy a house from her.

1903
01:24:04,241 --> 01:24:05,770
She's going to know my number.
You know,

1904
01:24:05,771 --> 01:24:07,810
like you might immediately think she's
so nuts.

1905
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:11,110
She took off her clothes and now she's
in fucking pussy soup over here.

1906
01:24:12,900 --> 01:24:16,150
Why there's got to be bubbled.
She's making a big cup of asshole tea

1907
01:24:16,390 --> 01:24:18,810
and she wants me to come over and look
into it like,

1908
01:24:19,060 --> 01:24:20,650
get,
get dressed.

1909
01:24:20,890 --> 01:24:23,620
I want to buy a house.
You want to go out for a drink?

1910
01:24:23,621 --> 01:24:24,470
We'll go out for a drink.
Um,

1911
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:26,970
some other time,
but not if there's bugs.

1912
01:24:27,180 --> 01:24:28,030
Show me the fucking floor.

1913
01:24:28,030 --> 01:24:29,560
Pennants word.
Jesus Christ.

1914
01:24:29,710 --> 01:24:32,230
What's the inspection look like?
I would think she's trying to distract

1915
01:24:32,231 --> 01:24:33,610
me.
I can try to distract me.

1916
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:34,920
What did the inspector said?
These,

1917
01:24:34,930 --> 01:24:36,730
this fucking house.
I've termites.

1918
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:40,090
Crazy bitch house could be falling apart
all around you.

1919
01:24:40,091 --> 01:24:41,020
Just like,
Damn.

1920
01:24:41,230 --> 01:24:43,210
It could be right.
We don't know.

1921
01:24:43,780 --> 01:24:46,150
We don't know shit man.
She's distracting me.

1922
01:24:46,210 --> 01:24:48,460
It's sexual.
She's sexually harassing you,

1923
01:24:48,670 --> 01:24:50,220
right?
Because you didn't request this sexually

1924
01:24:50,230 --> 01:24:54,820
distracting you and she's using her
sexuality to distract you from the world

1925
01:24:54,821 --> 01:24:56,800
around you.
Let's keep you from making good

1926
01:24:56,801 --> 01:24:57,880
decisions.
Let's flip it.

1927
01:24:57,910 --> 01:24:59,860
Let's flip it.
What if you are a young,

1928
01:24:59,861 --> 01:25:04,630
attractive woman and you show up and
you're trying to buy a house and you

1929
01:25:04,631 --> 01:25:05,411
hear,
oh,

1930
01:25:05,411 --> 01:25:06,340
c'mon.
And Debbie,

1931
01:25:06,341 --> 01:25:09,910
I'm upstairs and you go up.
I'm Mike.

1932
01:25:09,911 --> 01:25:12,170
You looking for the real estate agent,
you're a little person,

1933
01:25:12,280 --> 01:25:14,710
you're holding onto your iphone,
checking the text message,

1934
01:25:14,730 --> 01:25:18,130
make sure you've got the right place and
you opened the door and this dude's got

1935
01:25:18,131 --> 01:25:20,170
a fucking rod and he's sitting there.

1936
01:25:20,170 --> 01:25:23,020
It's poking out like a periscope.
I was thinking the same thing.

1937
01:25:23,350 --> 01:25:26,590
Call the fucking police right away.
Even if he had bubbles.

1938
01:25:26,890 --> 01:25:28,150
Is he naked?
No,

1939
01:25:28,170 --> 01:25:29,470
I'm calm.
I'm wearing bubble bath.

1940
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:32,050
You don't where bubbles are there?
It'd be like a court case.

1941
01:25:32,051 --> 01:25:33,400
Was he naked,
ma'am?

1942
01:25:33,401 --> 01:25:35,110
I was not naked.
You could not see me.

1943
01:25:35,170 --> 01:25:36,610
What?
Are you naked in the water,

1944
01:25:36,611 --> 01:25:37,271
sir?
No,

1945
01:25:37,271 --> 01:25:40,180
I was wearing bubbles.
That is not clothing.

1946
01:25:40,300 --> 01:25:42,070
Who are you to decide what clothing is
made up?

1947
01:25:42,190 --> 01:25:44,130
I was making.
So I was wearing something that does

1948
01:25:44,230 --> 01:25:44,631
that.
It,

1949
01:25:44,631 --> 01:25:49,631
it hit me in a modest way.
You could not see my genitals and uh,

1950
01:25:49,891 --> 01:25:51,280
I feel like I was okay.
Why would,

1951
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:54,310
your honor,
why would it be okay if he had a towel

1952
01:25:54,311 --> 01:25:57,010
on?
But it's not okay if it's got bubbles,

1953
01:25:57,011 --> 01:25:58,960
doesn't tell them bubbles to the same
fucking thing.

1954
01:25:59,650 --> 01:26:01,840
I don't know if she would immediately
call the police.

1955
01:26:02,020 --> 01:26:04,130
I think she would probably just scream
and leave.

1956
01:26:04,220 --> 01:26:05,600
I call the police.
I'd say no,

1957
01:26:05,610 --> 01:26:07,400
I press nine slash 11.
While I was in the house.

1958
01:26:07,640 --> 01:26:09,200
I'd be like,
I'm looking right at this guy's Dick.

1959
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:10,490
This is not cool.
It's not even.

1960
01:26:10,491 --> 01:26:13,690
His house is freaky fucker wants to take
baths and some houses that.

1961
01:26:13,691 --> 01:26:14,524
I mean,
what is she?

1962
01:26:14,780 --> 01:26:15,620
What is.
She was in it,

1963
01:26:15,621 --> 01:26:16,820
but what if she just showed up and she's
like,

1964
01:26:16,850 --> 01:26:17,690
Ooh,
Dick.

1965
01:26:17,710 --> 01:26:19,700
Because when.
What would you think at that point?

1966
01:26:19,701 --> 01:26:21,380
Well then you're good.
You know,

1967
01:26:21,550 --> 01:26:24,270
as long as that happens.
But that's pretty unlikely though.

1968
01:26:24,340 --> 01:26:27,590
Yeah.
That's like $100 off the ball ticket

1969
01:26:27,591 --> 01:26:30,410
ever fucking made off.
The chances are that crazy,

1970
01:26:30,411 --> 01:26:33,830
but they're close.
Think it's one and $292 million that

1971
01:26:33,831 --> 01:26:36,860
she'll jump on the deck.
If you didn't know the guy and you just

1972
01:26:36,861 --> 01:26:38,690
showed up and his dick was poking out of
the water,

1973
01:26:38,691 --> 01:26:41,150
you'd probably assume that was the last
few hours of your life

1974
01:26:42,950 --> 01:26:46,070
you would run and expect to immediately
run into a guy wearing a fucking hood.

1975
01:26:46,340 --> 01:26:47,220
You know,
like you,

1976
01:26:47,230 --> 01:26:50,270
you standing in the next room like this,
I'm going to die today.

1977
01:26:50,330 --> 01:26:51,860
I'm,
I'm a young girl.

1978
01:26:51,950 --> 01:26:55,760
I can't protect myself physically from
this guy with his heart on and who knows

1979
01:26:55,940 --> 01:26:58,610
how we set this up and who other.
Who else is in this building wants to

1980
01:26:58,611 --> 01:27:01,790
chop me up and burned me in the woods.
So I would assume,

1981
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,860
I don't think they need to.
They don't want to chop her up.

1982
01:27:03,861 --> 01:27:05,120
You know,
sometimes they do though.

1983
01:27:05,240 --> 01:27:09,680
You just fucking has a big Dick.
He wants to maybe do something maybe.

1984
01:27:09,770 --> 01:27:12,860
Or maybe she walked into a fucking trap
and this guy's like,

1985
01:27:13,610 --> 01:27:17,170
Charles Manson,
you're always assuming the worst about

1986
01:27:17,171 --> 01:27:18,260
matt,
about meme man.

1987
01:27:18,261 --> 01:27:21,590
You know he guys,
some guy sitting there in a truck with a

1988
01:27:21,591 --> 01:27:24,320
big erection.
He wants to chop her up and fuck it.

1989
01:27:24,321 --> 01:27:25,070
Barrier in the woods.

1990
01:27:25,070 --> 01:27:27,800
Some woman's in the tub,
she just wants to suck this guy's Dick

1991
01:27:27,801 --> 01:27:30,080
and show him the time of his life and
maybe sell them a house.

1992
01:27:30,170 --> 01:27:33,000
Do you not watch TV?
What you're saying?

1993
01:27:33,001 --> 01:27:37,340
That's what I'm saying is not normal.
I think it is pretty normal.

1994
01:27:37,341 --> 01:27:39,140
I think that's probably how most people
would think about it.

1995
01:27:40,340 --> 01:27:41,300
Yeah,
I think so too,

1996
01:27:41,310 --> 01:27:44,390
man.
Why maybe the MRI's,

1997
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:46,480
MRI's,
MRI's,

1998
01:27:46,860 --> 01:27:49,820
men's rights informant.
Hey,

1999
01:27:49,821 --> 01:27:53,630
I just want to tell you these fucking
men on this side plot and some shit.

2000
01:27:53,660 --> 01:27:56,840
They're going to troll your forums.
That's.

2001
01:27:57,060 --> 01:28:00,110
That would be a men's right informant or
a rat for the men's right organization

2002
01:28:00,111 --> 01:28:02,750
that tries to befriend feminists to get
close to them.

2003
01:28:03,050 --> 01:28:05,060
I try to try to be there.
Their lovers.

2004
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:06,960
Would it be,
uh,

2005
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:09,340
would it be um,
a men's with the men's rights informant

2006
01:28:09,350 --> 01:28:14,350
be someone who's a coil to the men's
rights movement and trying to gather

2007
01:28:14,361 --> 01:28:19,340
intel on feminists or reporting Intel on
the men's rights movement back to

2008
01:28:19,341 --> 01:28:19,800
feminine?

2009
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:22,130
That's a very good point.
It could because I could see it going

2010
01:28:22,131 --> 01:28:24,680
either way.
They're bright.

2011
01:28:24,681 --> 01:28:27,500
You could totally see like a guy
pretending to be a social justice

2012
01:28:27,501 --> 01:28:32,360
warrior who becomes a male feminist and
he uses hashtag feminism on his twitter

2013
01:28:32,361 --> 01:28:36,800
page and he makes videos about feminism,
but really what he's doing is trying to

2014
01:28:36,801 --> 01:28:37,581
get deep,
deep,

2015
01:28:37,581 --> 01:28:41,540
deep into the roots of the organization.
His ultimate goal is to get a position

2016
01:28:41,750 --> 01:28:44,750
with someone like who's that woman you
were talking about earlier before what

2017
01:28:44,751 --> 01:28:48,050
Anita Sarkeesian got one,
like one of those like one of the queen

2018
01:28:48,051 --> 01:28:52,730
bees get very close to her and perhaps
maybe help write some of her stuff or

2019
01:28:52,731 --> 01:28:55,970
perhaps get closer and closer to the
organization to maybe perhaps he could

2020
01:28:55,971 --> 01:28:58,810
have some influence or find out their
strategies and then what he does in the

2021
01:28:58,811 --> 01:29:01,620
clan to Stein arrangement.
Whereas the fucking black peacoat and

2022
01:29:01,621 --> 01:29:02,250
fucking

2023
01:29:02,250 --> 01:29:04,750
a wool cap and he meets on the docks
with the.

2024
01:29:04,751 --> 01:29:07,410
A real man and the real man is like,
what are these cons planning?

2025
01:29:07,620 --> 01:29:08,091
And he's like,
oh,

2026
01:29:08,091 --> 01:29:11,280
I'll tell you right now.
And he and he becomes a men's right in

2027
01:29:11,281 --> 01:29:12,690
form it.
There you go.

2028
01:29:12,750 --> 01:29:14,850
Could be one of both things.
This could be a movie.

2029
01:29:15,420 --> 01:29:17,610
I would say it would most likely go the
other way though.

2030
01:29:17,790 --> 01:29:20,760
I would doubt.
I would doubt a guy would be able to

2031
01:29:20,761 --> 01:29:24,150
even keep the job if he was a real.
A real man.

2032
01:29:24,210 --> 01:29:27,090
That's right.
I said it a real man that goes deep into

2033
01:29:27,091 --> 01:29:30,150
the heart of the Social Justice Warrior
movement just to befriend feminists,

2034
01:29:30,151 --> 01:29:33,960
to try to be their allies.
A real man would get sick to his stomach

2035
01:29:33,961 --> 01:29:35,610
and a very short amount of time.
You think so?

2036
01:29:35,850 --> 01:29:38,040
Most likely,
unless they had really good points,

2037
01:29:38,041 --> 01:29:40,830
in which case they probably would just
be egalitarianism.

2038
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:42,740
It wouldn't really be necessarily
feminine,

2039
01:29:42,750 --> 01:29:46,230
would probably be this thing.
They'd probably just be folks that

2040
01:29:46,231 --> 01:29:48,570
didn't want to get fucked with,
which is everybody,

2041
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:51,570
which is all humans,
you know,

2042
01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:53,610
but men's rights act.
That's what I wonder though.

2043
01:29:53,611 --> 01:29:54,760
Why is it,
why is it a.

2044
01:29:54,810 --> 01:29:59,070
Why isn't it okay to just be like,
how about everyone just treats everyone

2045
01:29:59,071 --> 01:30:00,420
okay?
Should be like,

2046
01:30:00,421 --> 01:30:01,290
why can't.
What is it?

2047
01:30:01,330 --> 01:30:05,250
Why is that such a controversial idea?
Why when you present that to a feminist,

2048
01:30:05,251 --> 01:30:07,500
like let's just be gender,
egalitarianism,

2049
01:30:07,501 --> 01:30:09,930
egalitarian,
and all other ways and you know,

2050
01:30:09,931 --> 01:30:12,390
as long as someone's not hurting you or
you're not hurting them,

2051
01:30:12,391 --> 01:30:15,030
you could just do whatever the fuck you
want and you know,

2052
01:30:15,031 --> 01:30:18,060
you would think that that would be a
perfectly reasonable proposition for any

2053
01:30:18,061 --> 01:30:21,420
human being of any ideology.
But it seems like it's rejected so

2054
01:30:21,421 --> 01:30:23,610
roundly by so many people all the
fucking time,

2055
01:30:23,611 --> 01:30:24,331
like,
no,

2056
01:30:24,331 --> 01:30:25,164
we don't want to do that.

2057
01:30:25,350 --> 01:30:28,290
We want to have our stupid little
ideological clique's and be like,

2058
01:30:28,291 --> 01:30:30,000
yeah,
we're the feminist and where are the

2059
01:30:30,001 --> 01:30:32,940
Mras?
And we're gonna have some lame Internet

2060
01:30:32,941 --> 01:30:35,490
fight until the end of time and annoy
the shit out of everybody.

2061
01:30:35,670 --> 01:30:36,503
Well,
I think,

2062
01:30:36,690 --> 01:30:39,030
I honestly believe this all bullshit
aside.

2063
01:30:39,060 --> 01:30:42,750
I think people are way better at
communicating now than they've ever been

2064
01:30:42,751 --> 01:30:46,710
before and I think we're going through
some growing pains and I think that's

2065
01:30:46,711 --> 01:30:48,340
what a lot of this stuff is.
My,

2066
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:53,400
my honest belief is that what we're
looking at winn block watch captain Kirk

2067
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:58,620
Duke it out with that stupid fake lizard
is very similar in a cultural context

2068
01:30:58,621 --> 01:31:01,140
like that's art.
That's like a piece of art that was on

2069
01:31:01,141 --> 01:31:02,730
television.
That's unacceptable today.

2070
01:31:03,090 --> 01:31:05,940
Well,
there's also communication that was

2071
01:31:05,941 --> 01:31:09,420
normal back then.
That's unacceptable today and I think

2072
01:31:09,810 --> 01:31:14,810
along the way there's some battles and
some some lines get crossed and some

2073
01:31:15,630 --> 01:31:18,390
boundaries get established and I think
that's exactly what we're going through

2074
01:31:18,391 --> 01:31:19,140
right now.

2075
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:24,140
When you blame men for everything and
then you won't talk about the real

2076
01:31:24,241 --> 01:31:26,610
issues like your issue because you're a
male,

2077
01:31:26,611 --> 01:31:30,780
you're getting sexually harassed as
inconsequential as compared to a woman

2078
01:31:30,781 --> 01:31:34,470
who was in the same situation or whether
it's divorce laws or whether it's

2079
01:31:34,471 --> 01:31:37,590
alimony or whether it's child support or
whether it's custody of the children.

2080
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:42,800
As soon as you have a male versus female
perspective and you ignore the enormous

2081
01:31:44,250 --> 01:31:49,250
gigantic range of people that exist on
the female and the male side,

2082
01:31:50,160 --> 01:31:53,010
they're so different.
Everyone's so goddamn different to to

2083
01:31:53,011 --> 01:31:56,160
have an ATM or aB team.
I think it's becoming more and more

2084
01:31:56,161 --> 01:32:00,130
preposterous and I think that's sort of
been highlighted by why we can so freely

2085
01:32:00,131 --> 01:32:03,280
talk about this.
We're mining so much humor and goofing

2086
01:32:03,281 --> 01:32:08,281
on these people so easily because it's
so easy to goof on them that over time,

2087
01:32:08,950 --> 01:32:12,580
those differences,
the ridiculousness of it will be

2088
01:32:12,581 --> 01:32:14,380
highlighted by our culture to the point.

2089
01:32:14,380 --> 01:32:17,530
It will be common knowledge.
Everybody will know that it's ridiculous

2090
01:32:17,531 --> 01:32:20,110
to side with all women or decide with
all men.

2091
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:23,710
Everyone will know that when two people
get drunk and have sex together,

2092
01:32:23,980 --> 01:32:27,070
if they're both consenting,
they both fucked up and no one raped

2093
01:32:27,071 --> 01:32:28,160
anybody.
You know?

2094
01:32:28,390 --> 01:32:32,050
There is a difference between rape and
two people getting drunk where the man

2095
01:32:32,051 --> 01:32:35,590
becomes a rapist and that's one of the
big problems right now that's going on

2096
01:32:35,591 --> 01:32:40,591
and this whole men's rights activist
versus feminists culture argument that

2097
01:32:41,230 --> 01:32:45,460
it's happened in at Occidental.
It's happened in numerous cases where

2098
01:32:45,461 --> 01:32:48,460
people have been blamed for things where
two adults get together.

2099
01:32:48,550 --> 01:32:50,800
They have consensual sex while they're
both intoxicated,

2100
01:32:50,801 --> 01:32:54,250
but the man becomes a rapist.
That's fucking bullshit and it's always

2101
01:32:54,251 --> 01:32:56,890
been bullshit.
It's so strange because there's no,

2102
01:32:56,980 --> 01:33:01,390
there's no other area where people are
exempted from their bad decisions while

2103
01:33:01,391 --> 01:33:02,224
they're drunk.

2104
01:33:02,530 --> 01:33:06,070
You know,
if I get drunk and I get in my car and I

2105
01:33:06,071 --> 01:33:08,320
crashed into a building or something,
no one says,

2106
01:33:08,321 --> 01:33:10,000
well you were drunk so you were
impaired.

2107
01:33:10,001 --> 01:33:12,670
So really the building attacked you or
how about this?

2108
01:33:12,671 --> 01:33:15,100
How about you assault someone,
you get drunk at assault,

2109
01:33:15,101 --> 01:33:16,700
someone you're responsible for your
actions.

2110
01:33:16,710 --> 01:33:17,920
100 for sure.
Yeah.

2111
01:33:18,130 --> 01:33:19,360
It's all stupid,
man.

2112
01:33:19,361 --> 01:33:21,470
It's stupid and it's,
it's based on if you hope,

2113
01:33:21,500 --> 01:33:24,660
if you're a woman and you open your legs
up while you're drunk and you,

2114
01:33:24,670 --> 01:33:26,290
they add,
bring it on,

2115
01:33:26,291 --> 01:33:28,810
you know you're not responsible for that
decision whatsoever.

2116
01:33:28,860 --> 01:33:30,930
Well,
I think that's the one decision where

2117
01:33:30,931 --> 01:33:32,470
society societal be like,
you know what?

2118
01:33:32,740 --> 01:33:35,170
You were taken advantage of.
You were raped.

2119
01:33:35,530 --> 01:33:38,470
I think that doesn't exist in most
aspects of society.

2120
01:33:38,471 --> 01:33:42,250
It only exists in universities and
amongst like super leftist,

2121
01:33:42,460 --> 01:33:46,210
progressive liberals.
That's the only way that they're trying

2122
01:33:46,211 --> 01:33:48,010
to turn the all of society into that.

2123
01:33:48,010 --> 01:33:49,960
Yes,
but it's being rejected is my point.

2124
01:33:50,250 --> 01:33:54,000
It's like the fact that there's so much
that's easy to criticize about it.

2125
01:33:54,080 --> 01:33:57,760
It's so easy to reject and uni just
sitting here when we just met today and

2126
01:33:57,761 --> 01:34:00,250
we both goofing on it like we like we
have a sketch,

2127
01:34:00,580 --> 01:34:03,370
like we planned out a sketch.
Was this the first time we've ever sat

2128
01:34:03,371 --> 01:34:06,070
down and talked together and we're like
bantering about this.

2129
01:34:06,071 --> 01:34:08,980
Like we've rehearsed it.
Like it's because it's so easy to mine.

2130
01:34:09,160 --> 01:34:11,080
There's so much preposterous,
stupid shit into it.

2131
01:34:11,230 --> 01:34:12,530
It's so.
I mean the,

2132
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:14,800
the,
the stereotypes are so fucking obvious.

2133
01:34:14,801 --> 01:34:19,300
He's like really feeble men who like
defend these hideous women who have

2134
01:34:19,301 --> 01:34:20,620
purple hair.
Like what am I,

2135
01:34:21,130 --> 01:34:24,310
is this,
is this a fucking show on the WB from

2136
01:34:24,311 --> 01:34:25,780
the early nineties?
Like what is this?

2137
01:34:26,260 --> 01:34:28,320
Remember the web,
the Wayans brothers.

2138
01:34:28,330 --> 01:34:30,310
Everyone remembers that.
Come on.

2139
01:34:31,330 --> 01:34:34,090
I think as it becomes more and more
ridiculous,

2140
01:34:35,530 --> 01:34:38,200
the more people will crack on it.
Those,

2141
01:34:38,260 --> 01:34:39,660
those ridiculous aspect,
you know?

2142
01:34:39,890 --> 01:34:41,380
I don't know.
I don't have the same.

2143
01:34:41,410 --> 01:34:44,920
I guess I don't have the same faith in
people that you do because all what I

2144
01:34:44,921 --> 01:34:49,921
see right now is that here are some
ideas that I was subjected to these sjws

2145
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:55,090
social justice warrior,
ultra feminist stuff.

2146
01:34:55,091 --> 01:34:56,560
I've been arguing with us on the
Internet for,

2147
01:34:56,561 --> 01:34:57,950
I don't know,
or six years

2148
01:34:57,980 --> 01:34:59,570
who said stop arguing with them.
They're not going to change.

2149
01:34:59,571 --> 01:35:00,404
I know,
but.

2150
01:35:00,860 --> 01:35:03,220
Well,
I do it because people like to watch it.

2151
01:35:03,221 --> 01:35:04,490
Like you said,
it's easy to mind,

2152
01:35:04,520 --> 01:35:06,050
but,
but uh,

2153
01:35:06,920 --> 01:35:11,920
I've seen them go from an obscure fringe
of Internet people who have no power

2154
01:35:12,741 --> 01:35:14,800
whatsoever to,
you know,

2155
01:35:14,810 --> 01:35:18,770
constantly having representatives on
mainstream media.

2156
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:23,000
They've infiltrated the journalists on
so many publications now.

2157
01:35:23,001 --> 01:35:25,760
I know that right now America is kind of
going through a,

2158
01:35:25,770 --> 01:35:29,300
a disenfranchisement with the media in
general anyway.

2159
01:35:29,870 --> 01:35:31,640
But,
uh,

2160
01:35:31,641 --> 01:35:33,020
you know,
it does seem like these,

2161
01:35:33,021 --> 01:35:35,870
these people are permeating mainstream
culture more and more.

2162
01:35:35,871 --> 01:35:39,270
It doesn't seem to me like they're,
you know,

2163
01:35:39,290 --> 01:35:41,660
they're on the run or something.
Well,

2164
01:35:41,661 --> 01:35:43,820
you can put it this way,
and I'm not sure if this is a valid

2165
01:35:43,821 --> 01:35:46,640
comparison,
but when you choose to engage them

2166
01:35:46,641 --> 01:35:49,430
online,
it's very similar to them being

2167
01:35:49,460 --> 01:35:50,930
interviewed on CNN.

2168
01:35:51,110 --> 01:35:53,540
Whereas like it's fun,
it's fun,

2169
01:35:53,541 --> 01:35:55,550
or there's a point of view that's
controversial.

2170
01:35:55,700 --> 01:35:59,930
There's a hot a hot button that you can
hit if you have someone who does

2171
01:35:59,931 --> 01:36:02,660
something.
Some guy does something and some woman

2172
01:36:03,170 --> 01:36:08,170
goes on some television show and he
argues that that man should be tried for

2173
01:36:08,571 --> 01:36:10,970
rape because he had sex with intoxicated
woman,

2174
01:36:10,971 --> 01:36:14,120
let's say maybe a celebrity or a
rockstar or athlete or something like

2175
01:36:14,121 --> 01:36:16,220
that.
If that became an issue,

2176
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:19,370
like you would immediately want to have
one of those people on because one of

2177
01:36:19,371 --> 01:36:22,400
those people is going to argue the very
strong position that that guy is a

2178
01:36:22,401 --> 01:36:24,560
rapist.
Whereas then you would have some other

2179
01:36:24,740 --> 01:36:28,100
men's rights guy on the other side or
some other,

2180
01:36:28,101 --> 01:36:29,270
you know,
social,

2181
01:36:29,330 --> 01:36:33,520
a libertarian type dude on the other
side and they would.

2182
01:36:33,550 --> 01:36:35,660
It would make for a great show and
that's what people do.

2183
01:36:35,660 --> 01:36:39,350
And so in doing that,
those movements grow and you find out

2184
01:36:39,351 --> 01:36:41,120
who that person is,
what their organization is,

2185
01:36:41,121 --> 01:36:43,340
what's the Hashtag,
find their twitter page,

2186
01:36:43,341 --> 01:36:45,020
boom,
like their facebook page,

2187
01:36:45,200 --> 01:36:46,340
boom,
you're in the circle.

2188
01:36:46,460 --> 01:36:50,600
And by doing that,
even you arguing with them online and

2189
01:36:50,660 --> 01:36:54,080
them doing this on these one of these
CNN type shows,

2190
01:36:54,500 --> 01:36:56,600
it's the same kind of thing and a lot of
ways because it's just,

2191
01:36:56,601 --> 01:37:01,000
it's creating a portal where people who
agree confine those,

2192
01:37:01,090 --> 01:37:03,670
those other folks that also doesn't
really seem like too many people will

2193
01:37:03,680 --> 01:37:05,120
find them through me,
agree with them.

2194
01:37:05,640 --> 01:37:08,210
Some of the things I see.
But that's comments and we've already

2195
01:37:08,211 --> 01:37:11,400
established the comments or maybe one
percent of the people watch if you

2196
01:37:11,420 --> 01:37:14,620
watch,
if you look at the metrics from the,

2197
01:37:14,740 --> 01:37:16,670
the,
the thumbs up and how many people

2198
01:37:16,671 --> 01:37:19,070
subscribe when they see those videos on
that stuff.

2199
01:37:19,790 --> 01:37:23,210
I'm sure there are people who find the
videos and to discover some feminists

2200
01:37:23,211 --> 01:37:25,490
through there,
but I've never made a thumbs up in my

2201
01:37:25,491 --> 01:37:27,280
life,
made a comment in my life.

2202
01:37:27,290 --> 01:37:30,710
Had Milo Yiannopoulos on the show a few
weeks back.

2203
01:37:31,270 --> 01:37:32,590
Uh,
I don't know if you're aware,

2204
01:37:32,610 --> 01:37:33,301
but he,
he,

2205
01:37:33,301 --> 01:37:36,860
he,
his twitter has been unverified.

2206
01:37:36,890 --> 01:37:39,020
We talked about it yesterday.
It's insane.

2207
01:37:39,021 --> 01:37:43,040
It's very strange because I cannot
recall anyone's twitter ever becoming

2208
01:37:43,041 --> 01:37:45,200
unverified,
known plagiarists.

2209
01:37:45,410 --> 01:37:47,270
There's no plagiarists that are
verified,

2210
01:37:47,300 --> 01:37:49,880
that have been proven as plagiarists.
They're verified.

2211
01:37:49,881 --> 01:37:53,990
And One guy who likes to poke fun and
fuck with people and does it in a really

2212
01:37:53,991 --> 01:37:55,290
humorous wally funny.
I mean,

2213
01:37:55,291 --> 01:37:58,230
what is his fucking twitter handle?
Say the dangerous faggot.

2214
01:37:58,260 --> 01:38:02,550
I think that's what he calls himself.
Like it's in a giant label across the.

2215
01:38:02,551 --> 01:38:04,950
Yeah,
on the top is the dangerous faggot tour.

2216
01:38:04,951 --> 01:38:06,040
And uh,
his,

2217
01:38:06,360 --> 01:38:09,030
his username is like at Nero Nero.

2218
01:38:09,930 --> 01:38:11,460
But the thing,
the thing about it is,

2219
01:38:11,461 --> 01:38:12,540
it's like,
yeah,

2220
01:38:12,541 --> 01:38:14,040
there you go.
He's hilarious.

2221
01:38:14,460 --> 01:38:15,900
He's a fun guy.
We had him on our show,

2222
01:38:15,901 --> 01:38:18,240
the show not too long ago.
But,

2223
01:38:18,241 --> 01:38:19,560
um,
the thing is,

2224
01:38:19,580 --> 01:38:20,401
the thing is,
I mean,

2225
01:38:20,401 --> 01:38:23,090
it Kinda just goes to the point I'm
talking about have,

2226
01:38:23,170 --> 01:38:24,270
you know,
here's twitter,

2227
01:38:24,570 --> 01:38:27,270
obviously taking sides.
They don't do this to the people who

2228
01:38:27,271 --> 01:38:28,460
are,
um,

2229
01:38:29,400 --> 01:38:31,440
who are feminists.
They do this people who are critical of,

2230
01:38:31,441 --> 01:38:32,300
well,
here's the thing that's,

2231
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:35,040
that's part of his bread and butter as
well with mining.

2232
01:38:35,041 --> 01:38:36,090
That's that,
uh,

2233
01:38:36,110 --> 01:38:39,390
you know,
my load doesn't have an egregious,

2234
01:38:39,950 --> 01:38:42,480
like,
isolated incident that they could point

2235
01:38:42,481 --> 01:38:44,880
out.
There's not one thing where you violated

2236
01:38:44,881 --> 01:38:46,710
the terms of service with.
They've alerted him on it.

2237
01:38:46,860 --> 01:38:50,160
They just unverified them because they
didn't cancel his account.

2238
01:38:50,250 --> 01:38:51,780
No,
they can't do anything.

2239
01:38:51,781 --> 01:38:53,460
It's not doing anything wrong.

2240
01:38:53,730 --> 01:38:57,300
So what they're doing by attacking him,
it's just making them stronger.

2241
01:38:57,301 --> 01:39:00,570
It's so crazy.
He got 20,000 new followers after they

2242
01:39:00,571 --> 01:39:02,160
unverified him.
Of course he did.

2243
01:39:02,161 --> 01:39:05,640
And also there's a shit ton of people
now impersonating him on twitter.

2244
01:39:05,670 --> 01:39:10,050
Of course he's not,
he's not verified so I can be Milo

2245
01:39:10,050 --> 01:39:11,610
Yiannopoulos and so can I.
and so can I,

2246
01:39:12,190 --> 01:39:15,840
it's been like hit the reaction from the
community,

2247
01:39:16,330 --> 01:39:19,140
but it's been a disastrous,
terrible decision for twitter.

2248
01:39:19,141 --> 01:39:22,560
But it Kinda shows where twitter's head
is at in this whole thing.

2249
01:39:22,561 --> 01:39:24,660
And there's so many sites that are
taking on these,

2250
01:39:25,250 --> 01:39:27,540
these guidelines.
Like if you actually read youtubes

2251
01:39:27,541 --> 01:39:31,080
guidelines,
like so many videos that I've made and

2252
01:39:31,081 --> 01:39:35,160
that other youtubers like me have made
like Sargon of cod.

2253
01:39:35,220 --> 01:39:36,270
I don't know if you're familiar with
him.

2254
01:39:36,440 --> 01:39:38,830
Yes.
A tenderfoot underfoot.

2255
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:41,340
Yeah.
Like so many of our videos really,

2256
01:39:41,880 --> 01:39:46,880
if if youtube just changed,
not even the verbiage of the guidelines,

2257
01:39:47,221 --> 01:39:49,200
but just their interpretation like
those.

2258
01:39:49,290 --> 01:39:51,330
All of our channels could be gone
easily.

2259
01:39:51,910 --> 01:39:56,340
They can say all of this is wrong and
sexist and vulgar and whatever guy in

2260
01:39:56,341 --> 01:40:01,341
Canada going to jail for doing nothing
more than a criticizing feminist online.

2261
01:40:01,531 --> 01:40:03,870
I don't know if that's played out yet.
A gag order.

2262
01:40:03,990 --> 01:40:05,460
See,
Canada has different laws.

2263
01:40:05,560 --> 01:40:09,660
Surely this is how it's been explained
to me and that this guy had already had

2264
01:40:09,661 --> 01:40:11,970
an issue with these women and had a gag
order to put on him.

2265
01:40:12,150 --> 01:40:16,080
Then he violated the gag order by
responding to their criticisms of him

2266
01:40:16,081 --> 01:40:17,880
online.
His point was like,

2267
01:40:17,881 --> 01:40:21,090
you can't just talk about me on twitter
and not have me respond.

2268
01:40:21,091 --> 01:40:23,130
That's ridiculous.
You're bullying me now,

2269
01:40:23,250 --> 01:40:27,930
and so he went after them after they did
that and then he gets arrested.

2270
01:40:28,050 --> 01:40:32,220
Then he gets like legit legal trouble,
so the question is should someone be

2271
01:40:32,221 --> 01:40:35,820
able to have a gag order?
And he apparently was working with them

2272
01:40:35,821 --> 01:40:37,710
at one point in time,
knew them first,

2273
01:40:38,070 --> 01:40:42,900
then became a look.
If you have a gag order,

2274
01:40:43,390 --> 01:40:45,260
um,
you know that,

2275
01:40:45,300 --> 01:40:48,810
that doesn't give the people who put it
against you the right to endlessly

2276
01:40:48,811 --> 01:40:52,290
publicly humiliate you.
I think you have the right to recourse.

2277
01:40:52,291 --> 01:40:54,010
That was,
she felt she had free shots at

2278
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:55,690
him,
so she started taking them and then he

2279
01:40:55,691 --> 01:40:56,770
was responding to those.
He's like,

2280
01:40:56,771 --> 01:41:01,000
I couldn't defend myself and somehow or
another in Canada that was worthy of an

2281
01:41:01,001 --> 01:41:02,710
arrest.
I don't know.

2282
01:41:02,711 --> 01:41:05,350
I get messages all the time about Sweden
too,

2283
01:41:05,351 --> 01:41:10,090
about how things are going crazy in
Sweden as a question though,

2284
01:41:10,120 --> 01:41:12,970
in terms of like I've been,
I've written several messages have been

2285
01:41:12,971 --> 01:41:15,730
written to me about how it's,
I don't know if it's,

2286
01:41:15,731 --> 01:41:17,200
again,
it's not against the law or anything,

2287
01:41:17,201 --> 01:41:21,400
but it's very frowned upon for men to
pee standing up anymore.

2288
01:41:21,440 --> 01:41:22,810
Yeah.
The should sit down like a bitch.

2289
01:41:23,110 --> 01:41:24,360
Yeah.
You got to sit down now.

2290
01:41:27,130 --> 01:41:31,420
Why is it so bad to sit down and pick?
Like if I ever showed it at the same

2291
01:41:31,421 --> 01:41:33,100
time,
I have a fucking problem with it,

2292
01:41:33,101 --> 01:41:37,150
but I like having the option of standing
up if I fucking want to.

2293
01:41:37,210 --> 01:41:38,370
Exactly.
You know,

2294
01:41:38,380 --> 01:41:43,330
I mean if it was like we suggest you sit
down and here's some reasons why I'd be

2295
01:41:43,331 --> 01:41:43,841
like,
okay,

2296
01:41:43,841 --> 01:41:45,550
these are worth considering.
Thank you.

2297
01:41:45,940 --> 01:41:49,210
But if it's like you should sit down
because it's unfair to women who don't

2298
01:41:49,211 --> 01:41:50,170
have a penis,
it's like,

2299
01:41:50,171 --> 01:41:51,520
well,
is that what they're signing?

2300
01:41:51,630 --> 01:41:52,150
Yeah.
I.

2301
01:41:52,150 --> 01:41:53,680
It's like,
I didn't write the biology.

2302
01:41:53,681 --> 01:41:54,630
What the fuck?
Wait a minute.

2303
01:41:54,631 --> 01:41:56,260
Someone's actually said that.
Yes.

2304
01:41:56,410 --> 01:41:58,450
That may be unfair to women who don't
have a penis.

2305
01:41:58,451 --> 01:41:59,860
That you can stand and pee.
Yeah.

2306
01:41:59,861 --> 01:42:00,371
It's like,
oh,

2307
01:42:00,371 --> 01:42:04,120
it's looked at as a male privilege.
What about birth till we get pregnant as

2308
01:42:04,121 --> 01:42:04,570
well.

2309
01:42:04,570 --> 01:42:07,690
Maybe we should put like Arnold 15 pound
rock in our stomach.

2310
01:42:08,210 --> 01:42:09,490
Junior.
I know if you remember that.

2311
01:42:09,491 --> 01:42:10,720
Yes.
But he got pregnant.

2312
01:42:10,721 --> 01:42:12,960
He actually got pregnant.
But.

2313
01:42:13,280 --> 01:42:15,310
So,
you know,

2314
01:42:15,311 --> 01:42:18,180
I would have liked that movie better if
they showed the scene of the baby

2315
01:42:18,181 --> 01:42:20,020
fucking coming out of his cock.
You know,

2316
01:42:20,021 --> 01:42:23,230
just like ripping it apart like a
bloomin' onion.

2317
01:42:23,231 --> 01:42:24,970
I think you got a c section.
Yeah,

2318
01:42:24,971 --> 01:42:25,900
probably.
Yeah,

2319
01:42:25,901 --> 01:42:28,810
I would assume.
But they should have had that scene

2320
01:42:28,811 --> 01:42:30,430
though.
Schwarzenegger's sneakers,

2321
01:42:30,431 --> 01:42:34,900
cock being destroyed by a fucking baby
swing out of it.

2322
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:37,480
You don't have any faith that we're
going to work through this really

2323
01:42:37,481 --> 01:42:40,180
unfortunate moment in our culture.
Oh No,

2324
01:42:40,181 --> 01:42:41,380
I'm anything.
It's possibility.

2325
01:42:41,410 --> 01:42:43,900
Do you think if president trump gets an
office,

2326
01:42:43,901 --> 01:42:46,090
everything will be solved?
Uh,

2327
01:42:46,150 --> 01:42:46,760
you know,
I think.

2328
01:42:46,760 --> 01:42:49,030
I think he could solve some problems.
Sure.

2329
01:42:49,060 --> 01:42:49,920
What do he get solved?

2330
01:42:50,110 --> 01:42:52,960
I think he could do good.
Some good things on infrastructure.

2331
01:42:52,961 --> 01:42:57,190
I like his tufts stance on China.
I wish that he would be.

2332
01:42:57,500 --> 01:43:01,630
I wish instead of talking about a trade
tariffs against China,

2333
01:43:01,631 --> 01:43:05,470
he would actually talk about maybe
getting China to cut off supply lines

2334
01:43:05,510 --> 01:43:07,160
North Korea.
Since you know,

2335
01:43:07,760 --> 01:43:09,970
there's a country that actually poses a
fucking grave,

2336
01:43:09,971 --> 01:43:11,710
imminent threat that no one wants to do
anything about.

2337
01:43:11,800 --> 01:43:13,720
Yeah.
There's no resources over there to jack

2338
01:43:14,940 --> 01:43:16,990
because we can't poor people,
but you know,

2339
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:18,940
it's like,
here's a guy that's,

2340
01:43:18,970 --> 01:43:20,230
you know,
putting his own citizens in

2341
01:43:20,231 --> 01:43:23,500
concentration camps whenever they
questioned is already killing people.

2342
01:43:23,530 --> 01:43:28,510
Here's a guy who was definitely working
on various weapons programs,

2343
01:43:28,850 --> 01:43:30,430
a hydrogen bomb.
Well,

2344
01:43:30,431 --> 01:43:32,260
I've heard some people be skeptical of
that.

2345
01:43:32,261 --> 01:43:32,981
I'm not sure.
Well,

2346
01:43:32,981 --> 01:43:34,090
you're online.
Yeah.

2347
01:43:35,440 --> 01:43:37,300
So there's always skeptics.
But um,

2348
01:43:38,740 --> 01:43:39,511
but yeah,
I mean like what,

2349
01:43:39,511 --> 01:43:40,900
what,
whatever the case may be.

2350
01:43:40,900 --> 01:43:43,990
It's a dangerous fucking place.
China is the only thing keeping them

2351
01:43:43,991 --> 01:43:47,060
solvent because they're the ones that
have the supply line.

2352
01:43:47,061 --> 01:43:49,540
So if trump wants to have this big,
tough stance on China,

2353
01:43:49,541 --> 01:43:51,890
I don't understand why he doesn't come
out and say we're going to fucking get

2354
01:43:51,891 --> 01:43:55,550
China to stop feeding this fucking
monster of North Korea.

2355
01:43:56,150 --> 01:43:57,140
But uh,
I do like that.

2356
01:43:57,141 --> 01:43:59,840
He's tough on China in terms of like
trade tariffs and shit.

2357
01:43:59,841 --> 01:44:01,810
And I think that,
uh,

2358
01:44:02,180 --> 01:44:04,100
you know,
in a lot of is a lot of his trade policy

2359
01:44:04,101 --> 01:44:07,340
and like a lot of his aggressive stuff.
I remember I was watching an interview

2360
01:44:07,341 --> 01:44:08,540
with trump where he was saying,
you know,

2361
01:44:09,080 --> 01:44:11,420
Vladimir Putin will respect me and all
this shit,

2362
01:44:11,421 --> 01:44:12,171
and I was like,
oh,

2363
01:44:12,171 --> 01:44:13,070
shut up.
Look,

2364
01:44:13,071 --> 01:44:15,050
I will cut you open,
you know?

2365
01:44:15,150 --> 01:44:19,040
Then I was watching a Vladimir Putin
talk and they asked him who he thought

2366
01:44:19,041 --> 01:44:20,000
the strongest candidate was.

2367
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:21,260
He's like,
I like trump,

2368
01:44:21,650 --> 01:44:22,970
you're strong.
You know,

2369
01:44:22,971 --> 01:44:26,680
so maybe Donald Trump was right when he
was reading Vladimir Putin.

2370
01:44:26,720 --> 01:44:28,970
Maybe that is the guy that Putin will
respect.

2371
01:44:29,420 --> 01:44:31,190
It's interesting.
We're not sure that we should be looking

2372
01:44:31,191 --> 01:44:34,820
for Putin's respect,
but it's interesting when you go online

2373
01:44:34,821 --> 01:44:37,100
and see the trump supporters,
like,

2374
01:44:37,101 --> 01:44:38,870
boy,
it's more interesting to meet them in

2375
01:44:38,871 --> 01:44:41,360
person.
There's a lot of strange humans in that

2376
01:44:41,361 --> 01:44:42,500
group.
Yeah.

2377
01:44:42,670 --> 01:44:46,310
Like finally a candidate who sees things
the way I do.

2378
01:44:46,780 --> 01:44:49,580
Personally,
I was telling your they over there that,

2379
01:44:49,581 --> 01:44:52,850
um,
that I was at Disney world a few months

2380
01:44:52,850 --> 01:44:54,500
ago because my mom is obsessed with
Disney world.

2381
01:44:54,501 --> 01:44:57,530
She always wants to go.
She'd been 23 fucking times and I've

2382
01:44:57,531 --> 01:44:58,910
been dragged a few times.
But,

2383
01:44:59,300 --> 01:45:00,590
uh,
I met a trump supporter.

2384
01:45:00,591 --> 01:45:02,300
They're your mom 10.
No,

2385
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:05,720
she's a 50.
But um,

2386
01:45:07,160 --> 01:45:11,950
I met this trumps for their big fat
woman stuck in a scooter cart.

2387
01:45:12,140 --> 01:45:13,160
Right.
And,

2388
01:45:13,161 --> 01:45:13,821
uh,
like,

2389
01:45:13,821 --> 01:45:14,870
um,
she's like,

2390
01:45:14,871 --> 01:45:15,680
I was like,
uh,

2391
01:45:15,680 --> 01:45:17,000
she's talking about trump and she's
like,

2392
01:45:17,690 --> 01:45:20,240
I hate Mexicans across the street from
me.

2393
01:45:20,241 --> 01:45:25,241
They are all illegal and loud now on day
nathen while now one do nothing about

2394
01:45:26,001 --> 01:45:27,830
it.
That's why we got to get trump in there.

2395
01:45:27,831 --> 01:45:30,520
I don't know what we going to do if we
don't get trumped.

2396
01:45:30,590 --> 01:45:31,940
Almost crying.
Wow.

2397
01:45:32,200 --> 01:45:36,470
Like emotional impassioned.
Like she wants fucking trump and she

2398
01:45:36,471 --> 01:45:37,610
wants him now.

2399
01:45:37,990 --> 01:45:40,290
Hmm.
And he's going to fix everything.

2400
01:45:40,440 --> 01:45:41,640
Yeah,
he's gonna fix everything.

2401
01:45:41,641 --> 01:45:44,250
It's going to be beautiful.
No one's ever fixed everything.

2402
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:47,040
No one has ever gotten office and
fucking shit got way better.

2403
01:45:47,041 --> 01:45:52,041
But the reality of the presidency,
if you look at Obama's presidency,

2404
01:45:53,240 --> 01:45:55,140
um,
as far as accomplishments,

2405
01:45:56,130 --> 01:45:59,100
it's very confusing.
It's very confusing when you look at

2406
01:45:59,101 --> 01:45:59,521
the,
uh,

2407
01:45:59,521 --> 01:46:01,200
the,
the data as far as,

2408
01:46:01,270 --> 01:46:04,020
um,
the economy because many people think

2409
01:46:04,021 --> 01:46:07,380
that he's done an incredible job of
building up the economy and,

2410
01:46:07,381 --> 01:46:09,510
and making the economy come back.
And like,

2411
01:46:09,511 --> 01:46:14,511
so I don't know because other people say
that the economy came back on a cycle

2412
01:46:14,910 --> 01:46:18,630
and that it was on a downward trend and
when the crash of 2008 happened,

2413
01:46:19,320 --> 01:46:22,380
there's automatically like a rebounding
and that's what happens.

2414
01:46:22,410 --> 01:46:26,670
Things go bad and then they get better
and there's been shifts.

2415
01:46:26,920 --> 01:46:30,820
The economy got a lot better for a Wall
Street.

2416
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:32,890
It didn't really get too much better for
normal people.

2417
01:46:34,270 --> 01:46:36,970
But when you limit the statistics,
I went up a little bit.

2418
01:46:37,420 --> 01:46:39,310
Yeah,
that's what I'm saying though is a tick.

2419
01:46:39,311 --> 01:46:40,750
But there's still huge unemployment
problem.

2420
01:46:40,790 --> 01:46:43,000
Right?
Well isn't it also the see the

2421
01:46:43,001 --> 01:46:46,360
unemployment things confusing to me too
because I think what also happens with

2422
01:46:46,361 --> 01:46:48,940
unemployment is if you're not looking
for a job anymore,

2423
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:50,310
it's not counted as unemployed.

2424
01:46:50,370 --> 01:46:51,720
Yeah.
So the people who gave up,

2425
01:46:52,170 --> 01:46:53,820
they don't count them,
but there's a lot of them.

2426
01:46:53,880 --> 01:46:57,330
They said there's a lot of people now
that are quote unquote retiring in their

2427
01:46:57,570 --> 01:47:00,090
twenties and stuff like they just given
up on work.

2428
01:47:00,091 --> 01:47:00,940
They're like,
Eh,

2429
01:47:02,300 --> 01:47:03,780
fuck the world.
How do you eat?

2430
01:47:03,930 --> 01:47:06,570
You just leach,
just Leech off other people.

2431
01:47:06,930 --> 01:47:08,130
Well,
there's gotta be a lot of that.

2432
01:47:08,131 --> 01:47:10,950
That's a,
that's a constant in society.

2433
01:47:10,951 --> 01:47:13,920
You're always gonna have people that are
lazy and unmotivated.

2434
01:47:13,950 --> 01:47:17,790
That's just always going to exist and
people will demonize those people and

2435
01:47:17,820 --> 01:47:21,000
try to say that all poor people or that.
And that's not necessarily true.

2436
01:47:21,310 --> 01:47:23,760
That's not true at all.
I know some really hard working people

2437
01:47:23,761 --> 01:47:24,910
who were very poor.
Yeah,

2438
01:47:24,990 --> 01:47:27,000
and it's also like,
excuse me,

2439
01:47:27,660 --> 01:47:30,480
circumstances which you were born where
you live,

2440
01:47:30,481 --> 01:47:34,170
the environment and where you find
yourself stuck as a small person with

2441
01:47:34,171 --> 01:47:38,130
parents that you didn't ask for in a
city that you didn't pick and you're

2442
01:47:38,131 --> 01:47:38,970
like,
well fuck,

2443
01:47:39,270 --> 01:47:41,310
you know,
and the idea that that person's the same

2444
01:47:41,311 --> 01:47:44,490
person as someone who's born in Beverly
Hills to fucking really wonderful

2445
01:47:44,491 --> 01:47:46,770
parents who bring them to a nice private
school.

2446
01:47:46,770 --> 01:47:47,730
It's,
it's crazy.

2447
01:47:47,970 --> 01:47:49,470
But this is,
you know what you're saying right now.

2448
01:47:49,471 --> 01:47:51,630
That's another one of these things
people like to rebel against.

2449
01:47:51,660 --> 01:47:53,790
They don't like,
they don't like the reality of like

2450
01:47:53,791 --> 01:47:56,730
maybe we all have different
circumstances and different hurdles to

2451
01:47:56,731 --> 01:47:58,230
overcome.
They don't want to hear anything like

2452
01:47:58,231 --> 01:47:58,980
that.
Yeah,

2453
01:47:58,980 --> 01:48:02,520
they just want to hear that America is
the fucking dream that,

2454
01:48:02,730 --> 01:48:04,660
you know,
anybody can be a success here.

2455
01:48:04,661 --> 01:48:07,410
Any,
any child born can be president one day

2456
01:48:07,411 --> 01:48:08,400
or something.
I mean it's,

2457
01:48:08,401 --> 01:48:10,140
you know,
it's just not realistic.

2458
01:48:10,440 --> 01:48:12,780
Well,
if the child wants to suck Satan's Dick

2459
01:48:12,781 --> 01:48:16,350
and make its way through the labyrinth
to the center of the heart of darkness,

2460
01:48:16,351 --> 01:48:18,540
yeah,
every child can be president,

2461
01:48:18,541 --> 01:48:19,920
but I don't have to go through the whole
song,

2462
01:48:19,990 --> 01:48:22,800
believe in Satan.
Whereas Satan's Dick is real.

2463
01:48:22,801 --> 01:48:23,880
Dude.
You seen it.

2464
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:25,140
Bill Hicks had a joke about it.

2465
01:48:25,170 --> 01:48:29,950
I know it's real
effects.

2466
01:48:29,951 --> 01:48:31,590
He would do.
Yeah,

2467
01:48:32,340 --> 01:48:34,590
Satan's cock.
I saw him do that live couple times.

2468
01:48:34,660 --> 01:48:35,550
Oh Wow.
Awesome.

2469
01:48:35,960 --> 01:48:39,660
He had a really long Harlan once live.
I never saw a bill Hicks live.

2470
01:48:40,050 --> 01:48:43,590
I saw Hicks alive a few times,
maybe three or four,

2471
01:48:43,620 --> 01:48:45,720
I think four times.
That's awesome.

2472
01:48:45,750 --> 01:48:47,130
Yeah,
it's a lot of fun.

2473
01:48:47,430 --> 01:48:49,710
I saw him before anyone knew who he was.
Interesting.

2474
01:48:50,510 --> 01:48:55,510
I saw him when he had just done one of
those Hbo Young Comedian Specials and a

2475
01:48:58,130 --> 01:49:00,030
note like very few people knew who he
was,

2476
01:49:00,031 --> 01:49:02,700
like maybe a few people that knew that
he had been on hbo,

2477
01:49:02,701 --> 01:49:04,590
like if you,
if you were on the marquee.

2478
01:49:04,650 --> 01:49:05,640
Oh,
been on HBO.

2479
01:49:05,700 --> 01:49:06,533
Oh,
all right.

2480
01:49:06,540 --> 01:49:10,500
But it's seven minutes on HBO.
It's just a bunch of funny gags and

2481
01:49:10,501 --> 01:49:12,240
bits.
But then when you see them live,

2482
01:49:12,241 --> 01:49:17,241
you got to see this full attack on
culture or life in general and the mall

2483
01:49:17,731 --> 01:49:21,330
mentality and Jimi Hendrix,
uh,

2484
01:49:21,600 --> 01:49:24,300
like it was some,
some betty did about Jimi Hendrix

2485
01:49:24,301 --> 01:49:28,200
meeting tiffany at the mall and
it was awesome.

2486
01:49:28,590 --> 01:49:30,240
It was awesome because I didn't expect
it.

2487
01:49:30,810 --> 01:49:32,550
The first time I saw him I was like,
wow,

2488
01:49:32,551 --> 01:49:34,050
this guy's crazy.
Like this is,

2489
01:49:34,051 --> 01:49:35,970
this is completely a different kind of
comedy.

2490
01:49:35,971 --> 01:49:36,541
Yeah.
I was,

2491
01:49:36,541 --> 01:49:38,640
uh,
he was already dead by the time I became

2492
01:49:38,641 --> 01:49:41,100
a fan of unfortunate man.
But,

2493
01:49:41,101 --> 01:49:42,780
uh,
I just know one of his ex girlfriends,

2494
01:49:43,560 --> 01:49:45,240
she was like,
I think she was his girlfriend,

2495
01:49:45,241 --> 01:49:47,680
like right before he passed too.
It was weird.

2496
01:49:47,710 --> 01:49:48,010
She was

2497
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:51,380
a comic too and she was just bewildered
by it.

2498
01:49:51,381 --> 01:49:53,860
She just kind of went into a shell,
you know,

2499
01:49:54,650 --> 01:49:57,520
when she was like this link to me,
like I knew her,

2500
01:49:57,521 --> 01:50:00,280
like she was like the link to like one
of the late great ones.

2501
01:50:00,281 --> 01:50:00,701
Like,
Oh,

2502
01:50:00,701 --> 01:50:02,440
you knew him.
He actually fuck back.

2503
01:50:02,450 --> 01:50:04,230
I'm cool.
You know,

2504
01:50:04,240 --> 01:50:08,590
it was weird to uh,
to know someone who is intimate with

2505
01:50:08,591 --> 01:50:12,340
like one of the all time greats as the
power of his dick still reside within

2506
01:50:12,341 --> 01:50:13,280
you.
Do you know?

2507
01:50:13,300 --> 01:50:16,060
So it,
it was also weird too that he was so

2508
01:50:16,061 --> 01:50:18,130
young,
like he died of cancer.

2509
01:50:18,131 --> 01:50:20,800
I think he was 33 or 34 years old.
Yeah.

2510
01:50:20,801 --> 01:50:25,360
It was really young and so much work
done by that time and so much of an

2511
01:50:25,361 --> 01:50:27,830
impact on the people that saw it.
Like he,

2512
01:50:27,940 --> 01:50:30,430
there was a possibility that he could've
gone to shit if he'd still been around

2513
01:50:30,431 --> 01:50:31,840
because like what,
what is it,

2514
01:50:32,080 --> 01:50:32,913
you know,
it,

2515
01:50:32,940 --> 01:50:35,830
it's,
it's a thing with like it happens with

2516
01:50:35,831 --> 01:50:37,710
comedians that happens with musicians.

2517
01:50:37,710 --> 01:50:42,070
It happens with movie directors happens
with just artists in general of like all

2518
01:50:42,071 --> 01:50:45,820
their good shit is really early on and
then it just seems like it goes

2519
01:50:45,821 --> 01:50:47,560
downhill.
Is that just like a matter of public

2520
01:50:47,561 --> 01:50:49,660
perception or do you think there's
something that like changes in the

2521
01:50:49,661 --> 01:50:54,460
mentality or it's depends on the
individual and what they work at.

2522
01:50:54,461 --> 01:50:58,150
But a good example is David Bowie.
David Bowie kept producing to the very

2523
01:50:58,151 --> 01:50:59,490
end.
I mean he just really wants to grab

2524
01:50:59,520 --> 01:51:00,131
them.
It was great.

2525
01:51:00,131 --> 01:51:01,900
Yeah.
So I think it's,

2526
01:51:01,901 --> 01:51:06,160
what are your motivations like what's
motivating you to produce things so you,

2527
01:51:06,230 --> 01:51:10,780
you just trying to fill up a hole that
was left by having an asshole stepmother

2528
01:51:10,781 --> 01:51:13,180
who you know,
fucking screamed at you and kicked you

2529
01:51:13,181 --> 01:51:15,220
out of the house when you're 17.
Is that what it is?

2530
01:51:15,370 --> 01:51:18,580
Or a zero,
like a legit desire to create and have

2531
01:51:18,581 --> 01:51:21,190
you cultivated that legit desire to
create?

2532
01:51:21,430 --> 01:51:25,690
I think some artists continued to be
really good throughout their lives and

2533
01:51:25,691 --> 01:51:28,650
then some artists,
they hit this wall somewhere and that

2534
01:51:28,670 --> 01:51:32,820
it's a wall sort of seems to coincide.
Superstardom like I think there's

2535
01:51:32,860 --> 01:51:36,880
stardom and then their superstardom and
I think superstardom is almost

2536
01:51:36,881 --> 01:51:40,960
impossible to ask someone to navigate
whether it's Michael Jackson level of

2537
01:51:40,961 --> 01:51:44,710
fame or fucking axl rose or whatever.
I think there's a level where

2538
01:51:44,711 --> 01:51:48,760
everybody's just like your brain just
get fucking scrabbled.

2539
01:51:48,761 --> 01:51:49,091
Like,
dude,

2540
01:51:49,091 --> 01:51:50,170
I could take it.
Like if you ever,

2541
01:51:50,171 --> 01:51:53,470
um,
have you ever been in a fighter jet blue

2542
01:51:53,471 --> 01:51:55,570
angels type situation now they,
um,

2543
01:51:55,700 --> 01:51:57,430
they roller coasters.
I don't,

2544
01:51:57,460 --> 01:52:00,380
I don't fuck around with like g forces
shit.

2545
01:52:00,440 --> 01:52:02,170
Well,
and a lot of ways it's kind of similar

2546
01:52:02,171 --> 01:52:04,690
in some ways,
but way more extreme obviously in

2547
01:52:04,700 --> 01:52:07,000
someone else's piloting it.
But I'm just saying like,

2548
01:52:07,001 --> 01:52:10,120
I can't even handle the little kitty
pussy version of that.

2549
01:52:10,120 --> 01:52:14,140
So there's no way there's,
there's amount of g force that you can

2550
01:52:14,141 --> 01:52:17,890
take and it's.
Everybody has a number and it gets to

2551
01:52:17,891 --> 01:52:19,000
like six,
seven,

2552
01:52:19,210 --> 01:52:20,080
eight,
nine,

2553
01:52:20,090 --> 01:52:22,960
10.
And the guys who are like the heavy duty

2554
01:52:22,961 --> 01:52:27,961
hardcore blue angel dudes can get into
like the 11th and twelfth and they just

2555
01:52:27,971 --> 01:52:30,160
stay conscious through this insane
pressure.

2556
01:52:30,280 --> 01:52:32,500
So they're banking.
He take these hard turns.

2557
01:52:32,501 --> 01:52:37,450
The g forces is overwhelming because you
have a jet engine and a plane that

2558
01:52:37,451 --> 01:52:42,451
weighs nothing and it's just flying
through the canyons and you're black out

2559
01:52:42,571 --> 01:52:46,820
like you feel your consciousness closing
like an elevator door and some people

2560
01:52:46,821 --> 01:52:50,540
can take a lot of it and some people
can't and it's a matter of like how

2561
01:52:50,541 --> 01:52:52,310
strong you are,
how used to it.

2562
01:52:52,311 --> 01:52:54,290
You are how accustomed you get to the
experience,

2563
01:52:54,291 --> 01:52:56,540
how much you practice resisting it
because you have to hook,

2564
01:52:56,600 --> 01:52:58,850
you have to hook,
you have to do little stuff where you're

2565
01:52:58,851 --> 01:53:01,430
forcing blood into your brain,
but it's saint called hooking,

2566
01:53:01,890 --> 01:53:05,990
but I think that's a lot like that sort
of Michael Jackson superstar them level.

2567
01:53:06,120 --> 01:53:07,580
Yeah.
I think it just like the pressure

2568
01:53:07,581 --> 01:53:12,560
becomes so fucking overwhelming that
only a few people can hang in there.

2569
01:53:12,561 --> 01:53:17,561
Most people just elvis out just fucking
blackout and pills and chaos and

2570
01:53:18,820 --> 01:53:21,560
shredding to the wheat field and gas
fires.

2571
01:53:22,280 --> 01:53:24,200
At least.
Elvis had an entertaining end though.

2572
01:53:24,540 --> 01:53:25,510
Cold.
A little trap.

2573
01:53:26,770 --> 01:53:27,740
Yeah.
He,

2574
01:53:27,741 --> 01:53:29,060
um,
he went out,

2575
01:53:29,110 --> 01:53:29,640
you know,
they,

2576
01:53:29,640 --> 01:53:31,350
they,
they remastered one of his concerts,

2577
01:53:31,351 --> 01:53:33,980
his last concert in Vegas.
They're showing it in movie theaters

2578
01:53:33,981 --> 01:53:34,700
now.
Really?

2579
01:53:34,700 --> 01:53:36,140
Yeah.
There was an ad for when I went to see

2580
01:53:36,141 --> 01:53:37,700
star wars.
It's fucking crazy,

2581
01:53:37,701 --> 01:53:40,460
man.
It's wild to see like it's like a time

2582
01:53:40,461 --> 01:53:44,930
capsule of Elvis on stage and he's kind
of overweight and he's sweaty and shit

2583
01:53:44,931 --> 01:53:46,430
and all these people going nutty for
him.

2584
01:53:46,790 --> 01:53:47,571
It's like,
wow,

2585
01:53:47,571 --> 01:53:49,370
this was a.
This was not that long.

2586
01:53:49,400 --> 01:53:51,230
You ever hear of extreme elvis?
Yes.

2587
01:53:51,231 --> 01:53:51,740
I know him.

2588
01:53:51,740 --> 01:53:54,360
You know him?
A little blog post about him in like

2589
01:53:54,420 --> 01:53:57,220
2002.
He doesn't do it anymore.

2590
01:53:57,310 --> 01:53:58,760
I know.
You've gotten too much trouble,

2591
01:53:58,761 --> 01:53:59,451
right?
It's a feminist.

2592
01:53:59,451 --> 01:54:00,284
No,
really.

2593
01:54:00,380 --> 01:54:02,540
That's crazy.
Told me he's a male feminist.

2594
01:54:02,750 --> 01:54:04,420
Wow.
I'm one of the argument with me about it

2595
01:54:04,421 --> 01:54:06,320
and debate then.
Good luck.

2596
01:54:06,820 --> 01:54:11,820
We're not interested in seeing how much
things weigh.

2597
01:54:12,150 --> 01:54:13,670
Doesn't do that anymore either.
I don't think.

2598
01:54:13,870 --> 01:54:15,840
Uh,
but I mean everything that,

2599
01:54:15,850 --> 01:54:19,250
that was good about them is gone.
We used to get hammered and he used to

2600
01:54:19,280 --> 01:54:21,590
be on stage and just get blast.
I'm like,

2601
01:54:21,840 --> 01:54:25,220
so wait.
It's like Elvis and Gigi Allen combined

2602
01:54:25,221 --> 01:54:26,780
into one.
That sounds pretty awesome.

2603
01:54:26,810 --> 01:54:27,680
It was pretty awesome.
Well,

2604
01:54:27,681 --> 01:54:29,810
here's the thing,
he's actually very talented as a

2605
01:54:29,811 --> 01:54:33,560
musician and so we're the band members
like the music was fucking good.

2606
01:54:33,570 --> 01:54:35,460
He sounded like fucking Elvis.
Yeah,

2607
01:54:35,490 --> 01:54:38,930
like spot on and there's a girl that
would sing with them who was hot and she

2608
01:54:38,931 --> 01:54:42,170
would take her top off and he would piss
in her mouth and it's like this micro

2609
01:54:42,171 --> 01:54:43,010
penis and he pulls out.

2610
01:54:43,010 --> 01:54:46,460
I mean it's a micro penis and he's
pissing in her mouth on stage because

2611
01:54:46,461 --> 01:54:47,900
like,
who wants to drink the kinds pissed.

2612
01:54:48,120 --> 01:54:48,951
She's like,
I do,

2613
01:54:48,951 --> 01:54:50,390
I do.
She's got her tits out.

2614
01:54:50,391 --> 01:54:51,860
The club's going crazy.
They can't like,

2615
01:54:51,861 --> 01:54:52,820
they're going to get fired,
right?

2616
01:54:52,821 --> 01:54:55,370
Or everyone's going to get a.
they're going to get evicted and closed

2617
01:54:55,371 --> 01:54:57,860
down.
So he's pissing in her mouth on stage

2618
01:54:57,861 --> 01:55:00,860
and the club owner comes up.
There was at one point in time,

2619
01:55:00,861 --> 01:55:05,810
he walked out into the audience and some
girl just started shoving a bottle up

2620
01:55:05,811 --> 01:55:08,870
his ass like a beer bottle.
So he starts backing up into the bottle

2621
01:55:08,871 --> 01:55:11,780
and then she panics and,
and just gets out of there.

2622
01:55:11,781 --> 01:55:13,380
I don't remember.
She would drop the ball a what?

2623
01:55:13,400 --> 01:55:14,300
But when he tried,
he's like,

2624
01:55:14,301 --> 01:55:15,710
that's the wrong holt's order.
We were hunting.

2625
01:55:15,950 --> 01:55:19,490
He like tried to help her stick this
beer bottle in his ass and that's what

2626
01:55:19,491 --> 01:55:20,324
she was like,
alright,

2627
01:55:20,570 --> 01:55:22,490
you when you,
when you took it too far,

2628
01:55:22,520 --> 01:55:25,640
they weren't willing to go to the same
extremes as extreme elvis,

2629
01:55:26,060 --> 01:55:29,120
but he was not getting paid for these
gigs because he was getting kicked out

2630
01:55:29,121 --> 01:55:31,340
and they would,
they would kick them out of there and he

2631
01:55:31,341 --> 01:55:32,270
would wonder why.

2632
01:55:32,730 --> 01:55:35,360
Strange.
Well me and Stan Hope,

2633
01:55:35,730 --> 01:55:36,670
um,
we're,

2634
01:55:36,680 --> 01:55:38,240
we're both there alive.
When it was,

2635
01:55:38,270 --> 01:55:39,830
it was like before we did the mantra was
like,

2636
01:55:39,831 --> 01:55:43,100
so it had to be like 2002 and he was
doing it back then.

2637
01:55:43,110 --> 01:55:44,580
It was really good,
man.

2638
01:55:44,581 --> 01:55:48,420
It was a good fucking show.
Like he was a really good singer and he

2639
01:55:48,421 --> 01:55:51,120
had great musicians and the girl could
sing her ass off,

2640
01:55:51,240 --> 01:55:54,810
like try replacing her.
A girl who can sing her ass off and she

2641
01:55:54,811 --> 01:55:58,470
lets you piss in her mouth onstage
because that's like the whole thing is

2642
01:55:58,471 --> 01:56:00,580
that like everything about the act is
like,

2643
01:56:01,110 --> 01:56:04,170
you know,
but the thing can't even conceive of it.

2644
01:56:04,290 --> 01:56:06,120
He's got his pants off.
Okay.

2645
01:56:06,240 --> 01:56:10,350
He's just pissed in her mouth.
The fucking crowd is in chaos and he

2646
01:56:10,351 --> 01:56:12,660
sang suspicious minds and they're
singing along.

2647
01:56:13,470 --> 01:56:15,950
Singing all caught in a trap.
Did it.

2648
01:56:16,170 --> 01:56:17,400
There's a little.
Dick is out.

2649
01:56:17,520 --> 01:56:18,930
He's fat.
She's a girl.

2650
01:56:18,960 --> 01:56:21,900
The girls next to them saying she's got
piss on her fucking tits.

2651
01:56:22,110 --> 01:56:25,910
He pissed her mouth where you can't go
on together.

2652
01:56:26,280 --> 01:56:27,930
It was fucking amazing.
It was one of the best.

2653
01:56:27,960 --> 01:56:32,580
It was on the best show in my life.
I wish I could have seen some of that

2654
01:56:32,581 --> 01:56:33,840
shit.
I need to be a club owner.

2655
01:56:34,510 --> 01:56:36,120
If I was a club owner.
I totally understand.

2656
01:56:36,121 --> 01:56:37,110
I'll be like,
I see what you're doing there,

2657
01:56:37,111 --> 01:56:37,944
man.
That was great.

2658
01:56:38,190 --> 01:56:40,380
You just went for it.
You could have just made him like the

2659
01:56:40,381 --> 01:56:43,290
House Act.
I connected him to Penn Jillette and he

2660
01:56:43,291 --> 01:56:45,870
performed a pendulum.
That's where I heard about him.

2661
01:56:45,871 --> 01:56:47,370
I heard about him for Pendula.
Oh,

2662
01:56:47,371 --> 01:56:49,140
okay.
Well I connected him with Penn.

2663
01:56:49,300 --> 01:56:51,930
Penn read my blog and penn contacted me.
He's like,

2664
01:56:51,931 --> 01:56:52,530
this guy real.

2665
01:56:52,530 --> 01:56:53,850
I'm like,
she's amazing.

2666
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:58,230
Because Penn came on fear factor.
Penn and teller will bolt on fear factor

2667
01:56:58,231 --> 01:57:01,440
and I became friends with pen and uh,
and then he hired him,

2668
01:57:01,441 --> 01:57:04,440
but he made sure he was so he wanted him
to be sober because penn is.

2669
01:57:04,650 --> 01:57:06,480
Penn is no drugs,
no alcohol,

2670
01:57:06,481 --> 01:57:07,980
no nothing.
He just like,

2671
01:57:08,010 --> 01:57:10,500
he has parties on his house and he won't
let anybody do anything.

2672
01:57:10,530 --> 01:57:13,050
You have to go there and you have to be
totally straight,

2673
01:57:13,710 --> 01:57:15,210
which I don't know,
he's an entertaining guy.

2674
01:57:15,211 --> 01:57:16,500
I mean,
as long as you're around,

2675
01:57:16,501 --> 01:57:19,410
dude,
I'll stay sober if you promise.

2676
01:57:19,530 --> 01:57:23,190
Don't go anywhere if you to stay being a
stay being interesting.

2677
01:57:24,300 --> 01:57:26,040
But um,
I don't think he doesn't anymore.

2678
01:57:26,100 --> 01:57:26,790
I think he's,
uh,

2679
01:57:26,790 --> 01:57:28,800
he's out of the business now as far as
extreme elvis.

2680
01:57:28,890 --> 01:57:30,150
Yeah.
Yeah,

2681
01:57:30,151 --> 01:57:30,760
I know,
I know.

2682
01:57:30,760 --> 01:57:31,730
He was as aware.

2683
01:57:31,740 --> 01:57:34,680
He'd been gone for awhile,
but I didn't know the full story like

2684
01:57:34,681 --> 01:57:36,080
you.
I,

2685
01:57:36,081 --> 01:57:38,400
I can,
I can say that elvis picture behind you

2686
01:57:38,430 --> 01:57:41,610
keep just like drawing my eye,
you know,

2687
01:57:41,850 --> 01:57:45,360
I'll start focusing on that and then
you'll become blurry and I'd be like,

2688
01:57:45,361 --> 01:57:48,500
oh shit.
He was one of the few guys that was a

2689
01:57:48,510 --> 01:57:51,150
white guy that could rock sunglasses
indoors.

2690
01:57:53,150 --> 01:57:54,690
Look at that picture.
I mean,

2691
01:57:54,691 --> 01:57:56,190
this fucking dude.
Is tHat the white house?

2692
01:57:56,450 --> 01:57:59,010
Okay.
He's got a fake mug shot that's taken

2693
01:57:59,011 --> 01:58:01,350
out the white house and he's got his
sunglasses on.

2694
01:58:02,430 --> 01:58:04,380
He was a bad motherfucker.
I agree,

2695
01:58:04,710 --> 01:58:06,900
but again,
too much g-force.

2696
01:58:07,140 --> 01:58:08,850
He spiraled out,
hit the rocks,

2697
01:58:08,880 --> 01:58:10,470
died young.
They all do.

2698
01:58:10,800 --> 01:58:12,480
It's just too much.
I think it's too much.

2699
01:58:12,481 --> 01:58:15,630
I think there's a reason why miley cyrus
is sticking her tongue out and going

2700
01:58:15,631 --> 01:58:17,820
fucking bananas.
She's trying to stay above water.

2701
01:58:18,050 --> 01:58:19,500
That bitches just being overwhelmed.
And

2702
01:58:22,510 --> 01:58:23,940
I think that's what happens to all of
them.

2703
01:58:23,970 --> 01:58:26,400
It's just too much fame,
you know?

2704
01:58:26,401 --> 01:58:29,310
And I think that's why a lot of artists
go to shit.

2705
01:58:29,490 --> 01:58:32,280
That's what I think.
I think the fame overwhelms the

2706
01:58:32,281 --> 01:58:36,420
creativity and that becomes almost a
primary focus of your life is mitigating

2707
01:58:36,421 --> 01:58:39,270
the effects of fame versus just
experiencing life.

2708
01:58:39,480 --> 01:58:42,340
I think for artists especially whether
you're a comic

2709
01:58:42,370 --> 01:58:44,380
or whether you're a musician or a
writer,

2710
01:58:44,590 --> 01:58:48,790
I think you have to experience life.
You have to go out and do things by,

2711
01:58:49,450 --> 01:58:54,450
with this set idea in mind of enjoying
the moment and having life experiences

2712
01:58:54,641 --> 01:58:58,720
or being in the moment and not
constantly worrying about the business

2713
01:58:58,960 --> 01:59:03,020
or ticket sales or concert dates.
I've

2714
01:59:03,020 --> 01:59:06,770
always surrounded myself with people who
are more pragmatic than myself so they

2715
01:59:06,771 --> 01:59:08,600
can worry about that shit because,
you know,

2716
01:59:08,601 --> 01:59:11,120
it's good to.
I can't really conduct myself in that

2717
01:59:11,121 --> 01:59:14,450
way.
I can't be concerned about like how many

2718
01:59:14,451 --> 01:59:18,080
views in the last video get,
how much money am I making this month?

2719
01:59:18,800 --> 01:59:19,550
You know?
Uh,

2720
01:59:19,550 --> 01:59:23,150
so especially if you start considering
in your creative process,

2721
01:59:23,210 --> 01:59:24,500
right.
Because I can't do that,

2722
01:59:24,501 --> 01:59:25,730
you know,
I have to keep it separate.

2723
01:59:25,731 --> 01:59:29,510
So that's why I kinda like,
I kind of leach off of the

2724
01:59:29,511 --> 01:59:33,860
responsibility of other people because I
can't really be responsible myself.

2725
01:59:33,861 --> 01:59:38,360
I have to be very,
like sort of a flighty and chaotic and

2726
01:59:38,361 --> 01:59:42,710
always just off doing my own thing.
Like every once in a while my friend

2727
01:59:42,711 --> 01:59:44,240
ben,
we'll just look at me and be like,

2728
01:59:44,270 --> 01:59:46,790
jesus christ,
are you a fucking cartoon character?

2729
01:59:46,791 --> 01:59:51,791
Because I'll just do weird shit that I
guess doesn't seem reasonable to him in

2730
01:59:52,371 --> 01:59:52,880
some way.

2731
01:59:52,880 --> 01:59:57,350
Like I just conduct myself in a strange
how fashion.

2732
01:59:57,351 --> 02:00:01,610
Like I'll the other day where we like to
get to la,

2733
02:00:01,611 --> 02:00:05,380
right?
We were supposed to leave at 7:20

2734
02:00:05,390 --> 02:00:07,490
because we got a flight that's leaving
an 8:45.

2735
02:00:08,020 --> 02:00:10,350
I'm there,
uh,

2736
02:00:10,400 --> 02:00:11,120
you know,
bike,

2737
02:00:11,120 --> 02:00:13,610
my friends ben and scotty who came with
me.

2738
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,160
Uh,
scotty's my brother ben is my friend and

2739
02:00:16,161 --> 02:00:17,840
cohost.
They're both actually cohost on my

2740
02:00:17,850 --> 02:00:20,390
drunken peasants podcast.
Doesn't matter because it on itunes by

2741
02:00:20,391 --> 02:00:21,224
the way.
Yeah.

2742
02:00:21,350 --> 02:00:23,240
And um,
they,

2743
02:00:23,300 --> 02:00:26,150
they come there.
They're both ready at seven slash 20.

2744
02:00:26,151 --> 02:00:28,400
Of course I'm not ready.
You know,

2745
02:00:28,401 --> 02:00:31,850
I'm still fiddle fucking around.
I'm barely fucking getting dressed at

2746
02:00:31,851 --> 02:00:33,590
seven,
20 7:40.

2747
02:00:33,591 --> 02:00:35,480
I come upstairs,
you know?

2748
02:00:35,481 --> 02:00:37,640
Uh,
it's like disaster after disaster.

2749
02:00:37,641 --> 02:00:40,100
The garage door fucks up,
it won't close.

2750
02:00:40,101 --> 02:00:43,370
We gotta fucking manually close it.
We get to the airport.

2751
02:00:43,371 --> 02:00:44,780
We were trying to drive the airport.

2752
02:00:44,780 --> 02:00:47,010
There's a traffic jam.
We got to change routes.

2753
02:00:47,540 --> 02:00:50,540
We get to the ticket machine.
The ticket machine says we can't check

2754
02:00:50,541 --> 02:00:53,030
in because we're too late,
but we already fucking checked in.

2755
02:00:53,330 --> 02:00:55,340
So we just needed to fucking print our
boarding passes.

2756
02:00:55,460 --> 02:00:58,160
All kinds of stupid shit happen.
So my friend ben,

2757
02:00:58,161 --> 02:01:00,230
he's like the kind of guy that gets
really stressed about shit,

2758
02:01:00,231 --> 02:01:04,040
like hyperventilating,
like when things go wrong and the more

2759
02:01:04,041 --> 02:01:06,620
shit goes wrong,
the more he's panicking.

2760
02:01:06,740 --> 02:01:08,960
Right.
And so he's really panicked.

2761
02:01:09,020 --> 02:01:10,760
He's in this fucking really agitated
state.

2762
02:01:10,761 --> 02:01:14,690
We're going through security,
he's running to the fucking plane

2763
02:01:14,691 --> 02:01:17,720
because he knows like this motherfucker
we're supposed to have taken off like 10

2764
02:01:17,721 --> 02:01:19,730
minutes ago.
It's going to be a miracle if he gets

2765
02:01:19,731 --> 02:01:21,980
there.
So he's running the onto the plane and

2766
02:01:21,981 --> 02:01:24,290
he gets on and uh,
you know,

2767
02:01:24,291 --> 02:01:29,291
then scottie gets on and finally,
like I guess at the last possible moment

2768
02:01:29,631 --> 02:01:34,631
before they're leaving the gate,
I show up and I get on the plane and I

2769
02:01:35,361 --> 02:01:38,630
sit down and I didn't realize it at the
time.

2770
02:01:38,631 --> 02:01:39,650
But ben,
scotty,

2771
02:01:39,651 --> 02:01:40,010
we're both

2772
02:01:40,010 --> 02:01:44,180
like staring daggers at me.
Like this is all your fucking fault.

2773
02:01:44,480 --> 02:01:47,020
You horriBle,
irresponsible piece of shit.

2774
02:01:47,021 --> 02:01:49,070
So you cartoon because you're late?
No,

2775
02:01:49,071 --> 02:01:52,100
no.
And then I fucking stick my leg,

2776
02:01:52,140 --> 02:01:53,720
you know,
staring daggers.

2777
02:01:53,721 --> 02:01:54,381
Me,
they're Pissed.

2778
02:01:54,381 --> 02:01:56,780
But I'm like totally oblivious to it.
I'm just like,

2779
02:01:56,781 --> 02:01:58,310
um,
oh,

2780
02:01:58,311 --> 02:02:01,250
let's see.
Has pretty good leg room for a plane and

2781
02:02:01,251 --> 02:02:02,690
they'll,
they're just like fuck it.

2782
02:02:02,691 --> 02:02:05,840
Burst out laughing at me and shit.
Cause it's just like I'm,

2783
02:02:05,841 --> 02:02:10,340
I don't make the connection between like
what other people think is supposed to

2784
02:02:10,341 --> 02:02:13,010
be serious.
What other people think is supposed to

2785
02:02:13,011 --> 02:02:15,470
be going on.
I'm just going to do my own thing all

2786
02:02:15,471 --> 02:02:16,304
the time.

2787
02:02:18,260 --> 02:02:19,430
So you're late.
Yeah.

2788
02:02:19,490 --> 02:02:21,470
It was like,
in other words,

2789
02:02:21,560 --> 02:02:22,580
I was late.
You were late.

2790
02:02:22,730 --> 02:02:24,800
I was late and I didn't give a fuck.
You're irresponsible.

2791
02:02:24,860 --> 02:02:26,530
a little bit.
I got it.

2792
02:02:26,800 --> 02:02:28,850
It sounds like a comedian.
I'm lazy.

2793
02:02:28,851 --> 02:02:30,740
I'm lazy.
I'm irresponsible.

2794
02:02:30,830 --> 02:02:33,140
I fuck with you saying it like it's
almost like a badge of courage.

2795
02:02:33,141 --> 02:02:34,930
Like you like it.
Yeah,

2796
02:02:34,940 --> 02:02:36,860
sure.
I like being the way I am,

2797
02:02:36,950 --> 02:02:41,000
but I'm just saying that I have them
around to be like these nagging bitches

2798
02:02:41,450 --> 02:02:45,230
to kind of be my handlers.
Cattle Prod me into fucking actually

2799
02:02:45,231 --> 02:02:48,440
doing an associate because you know,
left to my own devices.

2800
02:02:48,620 --> 02:02:52,220
Could I have gotten on a plane and come
to la and been on the joe rogan podcast?

2801
02:02:52,430 --> 02:02:54,470
Probably not.
I don't think so now.

2802
02:02:54,830 --> 02:02:56,470
That's sad.
I had to just been like,

2803
02:02:56,510 --> 02:02:58,190
feel like you could make it if your life
depended on it.

2804
02:02:58,520 --> 02:03:00,280
Maybe just not tell you if you're
standing on it,

2805
02:03:00,320 --> 02:03:01,880
but you know,
I'd probably just sit there and be like,

2806
02:03:01,881 --> 02:03:03,830
you know,
do I want to be on joe rogan?

2807
02:03:03,860 --> 02:03:06,560
Yeah.
Do I want to travel across the country

2808
02:03:06,561 --> 02:03:08,420
now?
I'd rather sit here and watch netflix.

2809
02:03:09,140 --> 02:03:11,030
Well,
we've always threatened to do shows on

2810
02:03:11,031 --> 02:03:12,220
skype,
but it's just,

2811
02:03:12,300 --> 02:03:13,133
it's no,
no,

2812
02:03:13,180 --> 02:03:14,390
you don't think you should,
you know,

2813
02:03:14,391 --> 02:03:19,070
you got this whole like face to face,
like in person thing going on,

2814
02:03:19,280 --> 02:03:21,560
you lose something with the skype thing.
I think so too.

2815
02:03:21,590 --> 02:03:23,090
But there's a few people that you can't
get,

2816
02:03:23,091 --> 02:03:25,760
like kim.com.
I'd like to get him because he's in.

2817
02:03:26,010 --> 02:03:28,880
You can't leave New Zealand or maybe
just make exceptions for people like,

2818
02:03:28,881 --> 02:03:31,100
yeah,
I want to do him because I want to do

2819
02:03:31,101 --> 02:03:32,770
him,
you know,

2820
02:03:32,840 --> 02:03:35,690
him doing show.
Um,

2821
02:03:35,960 --> 02:03:39,380
I feel like he's really getting a raw
deal in a real weird deal the way a lot

2822
02:03:39,381 --> 02:03:41,660
of people have asked me to describe your
height.

2823
02:03:42,050 --> 02:03:42,680
Five.
Eight,

2824
02:03:42,680 --> 02:03:43,370
five,
eight?

2825
02:03:43,370 --> 02:03:44,270
Yes.
Okay.

2826
02:03:44,540 --> 02:03:45,830
Describe it.
Well,

2827
02:03:45,831 --> 02:03:46,900
no,
because we found all this.

2828
02:03:47,060 --> 02:03:50,260
We found contradictory information.
We can unconsciously roommates or some

2829
02:03:50,270 --> 02:03:51,400
shit.
You said you were like five,

2830
02:03:51,430 --> 02:03:52,640
six some shit.
Said you were five,

2831
02:03:52,641 --> 02:03:54,260
nine,
five,

2832
02:03:54,261 --> 02:03:55,370
eight,
five eight.

2833
02:03:55,550 --> 02:03:57,000
Right in the middle.
Five eight.

2834
02:03:58,190 --> 02:04:00,980
I'm kim dotcom to giant guy.
he's huge.

2835
02:04:01,400 --> 02:04:04,100
He's like this cushion for the pushing.
Fascinating dude.

2836
02:04:04,101 --> 02:04:05,650
Man.
A key.

2837
02:04:05,660 --> 02:04:07,160
Um,
it all.

2838
02:04:07,161 --> 02:04:08,990
If you don't know his story,
it all came from,

2839
02:04:09,080 --> 02:04:11,300
but people that are listening to came
from mega upload.

2840
02:04:11,540 --> 02:04:13,340
he had one of those upload sites,
but they don't,

2841
02:04:13,341 --> 02:04:14,630
they don't really have those anymore,
do they?

2842
02:04:15,320 --> 02:04:17,030
Um,
I think there's still some version of

2843
02:04:17,031 --> 02:04:19,580
mega upload around,
but it's not at the same url or

2844
02:04:19,581 --> 02:04:21,790
anything,
but used to be that like you were,

2845
02:04:21,800 --> 02:04:23,990
I could upload something under an
account,

2846
02:04:23,991 --> 02:04:27,710
like you could upload a movie and I
could download it from your account so

2847
02:04:27,711 --> 02:04:31,640
you could take a pirated record,
sharp load online.

2848
02:04:31,850 --> 02:04:36,100
And so they made him responsible for all
this stuff that people uploaded.

2849
02:04:36,110 --> 02:04:37,320
He did.
He invented that,

2850
02:04:37,550 --> 02:04:38,310
you know?
Yeah,

2851
02:04:38,310 --> 02:04:38,620
yeah,
yeah.

2852
02:04:38,620 --> 02:04:39,720
He didn't invent shit.
I mean,

2853
02:04:39,740 --> 02:04:41,480
there was plenty,
there was plenty of services doing it.

2854
02:04:41,790 --> 02:04:45,270
Google had their own version of services
that we're doing it for some reason.

2855
02:04:45,271 --> 02:04:46,780
This guy was the problem.
Yeah.

2856
02:04:46,800 --> 02:04:49,200
Why was that?
Why did he get in trouble?

2857
02:04:49,260 --> 02:04:50,970
Because he flaunted it.
Is that what it was?

2858
02:04:50,990 --> 02:04:52,860
Yeah.
I mean he flaunted it and he changed his

2859
02:04:52,861 --> 02:04:55,560
name to [inaudible] dot com.
He made a spectacle of himself.

2860
02:04:56,340 --> 02:04:58,380
Yeah.
He used to be called like kimball or

2861
02:04:58,381 --> 02:05:01,170
something like that and he used to have.
We did this before,

2862
02:05:01,230 --> 02:05:03,990
remember jamie,
we played some of his old animations.

2863
02:05:04,710 --> 02:05:08,880
You remember that it was kimbo or it
might've been kimbo.

2864
02:05:08,881 --> 02:05:12,550
He was calling himself before kimbo
slice kimbo or kimber or kimba,

2865
02:05:12,960 --> 02:05:15,810
I forget what it was,
but he had this website way back in the

2866
02:05:15,810 --> 02:05:20,700
day when he was just like a really
resourceful hacker and he had like a

2867
02:05:20,701 --> 02:05:24,570
flash,
like a suPer complex flash animated

2868
02:05:24,630 --> 02:05:28,230
opening to his website like way back in
the day and he was way,

2869
02:05:28,231 --> 02:05:30,510
way,
way ahead of the curve and he made these

2870
02:05:30,511 --> 02:05:35,511
like really funny little animated things
of him being in his mega car going to

2871
02:05:36,091 --> 02:05:36,960
his mega boat.

2872
02:05:36,960 --> 02:05:39,900
You remember all that kimball?
That's what it was.

2873
02:05:40,030 --> 02:05:41,820
It does before he called himself
kim.com.

2874
02:05:42,150 --> 02:05:42,961
Yeah.
But I mean like,

2875
02:05:42,961 --> 02:05:44,730
you know,
it's kind of easy to see why he gets

2876
02:05:44,731 --> 02:05:45,780
singled out.
I mean if you got,

2877
02:05:45,840 --> 02:05:47,280
you know,
I don't know,

2878
02:05:47,281 --> 02:05:49,860
10 drug dealers and most of them are
really low key,

2879
02:05:49,861 --> 02:05:53,790
but one guy's out there like,
I'm the fucking drug king Pin bitch,

2880
02:05:54,230 --> 02:05:56,160
you know,
who the fuck you is going to attract the

2881
02:05:56,161 --> 02:05:57,330
attention.
Of course.

2882
02:05:57,510 --> 02:05:59,010
Yeah.
no,

2883
02:05:59,011 --> 02:06:02,340
I mean it makes sense I guess.
And also he didn't have the benefit of

2884
02:06:02,341 --> 02:06:05,820
being attached to a giant company like
google or one of the other file sharing

2885
02:06:05,821 --> 02:06:09,120
companies and he probably wouldn't
provide the information that they would

2886
02:06:09,600 --> 02:06:13,260
provide about the people that are
uploading things because I would imagine

2887
02:06:13,261 --> 02:06:15,810
someone like google or someone like if
you upload something illegal,

2888
02:06:15,811 --> 02:06:16,660
they probably made.

2889
02:06:18,030 --> 02:06:19,770
They probably make it pretty transparent
thing.

2890
02:06:19,810 --> 02:06:21,540
Gonna take your side over the
government's now.

2891
02:06:22,080 --> 02:06:23,460
Sorry dude,
we got.

2892
02:06:23,480 --> 02:06:25,560
We're here to make money.
You tripped us up.

2893
02:06:25,770 --> 02:06:28,380
So I wonder what's going to happen with
him because they took all his money,

2894
02:06:28,381 --> 02:06:31,650
right?
I mean know what his current situation

2895
02:06:31,651 --> 02:06:35,610
is.
I try to move them kind like a uh,

2896
02:06:36,230 --> 02:06:38,340
I don't know.
They're trying to fly him to America.

2897
02:06:38,520 --> 02:06:40,620
It's been like,
it's been two years since I heard

2898
02:06:40,621 --> 02:06:42,180
anything about that case.
I just don't know.

2899
02:06:42,870 --> 02:06:46,200
Yeah,
I'm vice went and interviewed him fairly

2900
02:06:46,201 --> 02:06:48,210
recently,
like I want to say within the last year.

2901
02:06:48,570 --> 02:06:52,320
And I didn't see that he's got a
remarkably upbeat attitude about all

2902
02:06:52,321 --> 02:06:53,640
this,
but you know,

2903
02:06:53,641 --> 02:06:58,641
it's essentially one guy and whatever
organization he has left versus United

2904
02:06:58,980 --> 02:07:00,870
States government,
the new New Zealand governments

2905
02:07:00,871 --> 02:07:04,020
complying,
they gave up all his money and the whole

2906
02:07:04,021 --> 02:07:06,250
thing's kinda kinda reminds me of larry
flynt and away.

2907
02:07:07,040 --> 02:07:10,560
Hmm.
Flint seem like more of a victim because

2908
02:07:10,561 --> 02:07:12,330
there was no one who is being stolen
from.

2909
02:07:12,331 --> 02:07:14,350
There was no lost revenue by him
showing,

2910
02:07:15,870 --> 02:07:17,760
you know,
but it was still someone who was,

2911
02:07:17,761 --> 02:07:20,540
you know,
agitating the,

2912
02:07:20,910 --> 02:07:23,130
you know,
not necessarily morality in the case of

2913
02:07:23,131 --> 02:07:24,810
kim dotcom but agitating,
you know,

2914
02:07:24,840 --> 02:07:29,400
the law abiding sector or whatever.
And you know,

2915
02:07:29,401 --> 02:07:33,780
he was kinda like,
they both got shit on and made a victim

2916
02:07:33,781 --> 02:07:35,980
of and just like almost was like a

2917
02:07:35,980 --> 02:07:40,630
one man show down against the entire
government and both of those situations

2918
02:07:41,020 --> 02:07:41,990
and.
But yeah,

2919
02:07:42,040 --> 02:07:44,140
movie star at a courtney love.
Yeah.

2920
02:07:44,380 --> 02:07:45,710
I think larry flynt was,
uh,

2921
02:07:46,160 --> 02:07:48,640
was probably a more of a victim though.
You're probably right about that.

2922
02:07:48,700 --> 02:07:49,990
Yeah.
It doesn't seem like there's any

2923
02:07:49,991 --> 02:07:52,840
arguments good in that she was playing a
heroin junkie.

2924
02:07:52,841 --> 02:07:55,710
So vain and it's probably not.
Did you see the church?

2925
02:07:56,400 --> 02:07:57,233
No,
I haven't seen it yet.

2926
02:07:57,550 --> 02:07:59,100
I saw the other night.
Whoa.

2927
02:07:59,820 --> 02:08:00,470
What is it?
Is it,

2928
02:08:00,470 --> 02:08:02,160
is it like a conspiracy thing?
Ah,

2929
02:08:02,190 --> 02:08:04,550
it's the conspiracy where they believed
that,

2930
02:08:04,551 --> 02:08:06,810
uh,
courtney love had kurt cobain killed or

2931
02:08:06,811 --> 02:08:09,960
was involved somehow or another in his
murder and that she had.

2932
02:08:10,730 --> 02:08:13,650
There's evidence.
They believe that she forged his,

2933
02:08:13,651 --> 02:08:15,270
uh,
his death letter,

2934
02:08:15,660 --> 02:08:20,090
her know I've heard the suicide note
forging thing when you listen to like

2935
02:08:20,100 --> 02:08:22,500
the recordings that he,
uh,

2936
02:08:22,501 --> 02:08:26,580
the private investigator has with her
and you get a glimpse into her mindset.

2937
02:08:26,581 --> 02:08:27,414
You're like,
ooh.

2938
02:08:27,930 --> 02:08:31,020
Like they fucked up either whether she
was innocent or not.

2939
02:08:31,050 --> 02:08:33,420
They absolutely fucked up the burden
investigation.

2940
02:08:33,570 --> 02:08:35,040
The murder investigation was,
or the,

2941
02:08:35,070 --> 02:08:36,750
excuse me,
the death investigation,

2942
02:08:36,751 --> 02:08:38,730
suicide investigation.
They fucked it up.

2943
02:08:38,731 --> 02:08:40,920
Like they ruled it a suicide before the
coroner did.

2944
02:08:41,180 --> 02:08:43,560
Like there was,
there was so much of it that varied from

2945
02:08:43,561 --> 02:08:46,830
the first responder,
like his version of the scene versus

2946
02:08:46,860 --> 02:08:47,610
the,
uh,

2947
02:08:47,610 --> 02:08:49,620
the police department's version of the
scene.

2948
02:08:49,920 --> 02:08:52,060
Like what,
when they compare,

2949
02:08:53,160 --> 02:08:56,310
compare the two stories.
The whole thing is it's definitely a

2950
02:08:56,311 --> 02:08:58,470
cluster.
Fucking sheriff wound up getting fired

2951
02:08:58,471 --> 02:09:01,820
for some other in competence or fuckery.
It's,

2952
02:09:01,821 --> 02:09:04,770
it's a very disturbing.
It's very disturbing documentary.

2953
02:09:04,820 --> 02:09:08,030
But who knows how many cases the same
department had botched before they just

2954
02:09:08,031 --> 02:09:10,850
had this high profile one to botch.
Sure.

2955
02:09:10,970 --> 02:09:13,280
I mean,
how many people are sitting in prisons

2956
02:09:13,281 --> 02:09:14,570
right now that don't deserve to be
there?

2957
02:09:14,571 --> 02:09:15,240
Probably tonight.

2958
02:09:15,240 --> 02:09:16,080
Oh,
a lot.

2959
02:09:16,150 --> 02:09:17,040
Yeah,
a lot.

2960
02:09:17,400 --> 02:09:18,570
Yeah,
no doubt about it,

2961
02:09:18,571 --> 02:09:19,404
man.
Well,

2962
02:09:19,410 --> 02:09:22,140
that's what this making a murderer.
The other netflix thing is about.

2963
02:09:22,200 --> 02:09:22,800
Yeah,
they're,

2964
02:09:22,800 --> 02:09:27,800
they're trying to show you how fucking
chaotic and criminal some police

2965
02:09:28,831 --> 02:09:30,330
departments really are.
I mean,

2966
02:09:30,331 --> 02:09:32,640
how,
what kind of nutty shit really does go

2967
02:09:32,641 --> 02:09:34,560
down and some of these small town police
department.

2968
02:09:34,710 --> 02:09:36,000
I was reading about a,
uh,

2969
02:09:36,001 --> 02:09:37,800
a case.
This isn't something back from the

2970
02:09:37,801 --> 02:09:38,940
seventies,
but uh,

2971
02:09:39,690 --> 02:09:42,480
there was um,
these janitors.

2972
02:09:42,540 --> 02:09:44,850
There was like five janitors at this
high school.

2973
02:09:45,330 --> 02:09:49,050
I'm,
this white girl's body was found,

2974
02:09:49,110 --> 02:09:51,480
uh,
raped and murdered in the attic of the

2975
02:09:51,481 --> 02:09:54,040
school and the sheriff,
you know,

2976
02:09:54,060 --> 02:09:57,210
walked into the room with the five
janitors and four of them are white and

2977
02:09:57,211 --> 02:09:58,110
one of them is black.
She,

2978
02:09:58,111 --> 02:09:59,010
he's like,
you know,

2979
02:09:59,011 --> 02:10:02,910
someone's going to have to hang for this
and urine nigger.

2980
02:10:02,911 --> 02:10:05,370
So I'm afraid it's going to have to be
you.

2981
02:10:05,610 --> 02:10:07,530
So I mean,
that's like the attitude.

2982
02:10:08,220 --> 02:10:10,800
Um,
jesus christ.

2983
02:10:11,010 --> 02:10:12,690
Pretty brazen.
This was Texas,

2984
02:10:12,691 --> 02:10:14,940
I believe.
So what year was this?

2985
02:10:15,030 --> 02:10:17,020
Seventies.
God.

2986
02:10:17,220 --> 02:10:17,671
Well,
again,

2987
02:10:17,671 --> 02:10:19,830
what we're talking about,
if you know,

2988
02:10:19,831 --> 02:10:22,590
if you want to,
if I'm mistaking any details of it,

2989
02:10:22,591 --> 02:10:27,450
the whole thing can be found in this
video I did called like the top 10,

2990
02:10:28,020 --> 02:10:33,020
a false rape accusations or something
like that because was,

2991
02:10:33,500 --> 02:10:37,310
it was basically all these people who
have gone to jail for rape allegations

2992
02:10:37,311 --> 02:10:41,240
that later turned out to be false or
there's got to be hundreds and

2993
02:10:41,240 --> 02:10:41,240
thousands.

2994
02:10:41,240 --> 02:10:41,961
Tons,
tons,

2995
02:10:41,961 --> 02:10:43,100
tons.
It's terrifying.

2996
02:10:43,430 --> 02:10:46,910
The idea that people get locked up and
even executed for somethIng that they

2997
02:10:46,911 --> 02:10:49,720
had no part in.
It's terrifying.

2998
02:10:49,721 --> 02:10:50,770
It's amazing how,
I mean,

2999
02:10:50,780 --> 02:10:52,100
uh,
dna evidence.

3000
02:10:52,310 --> 02:10:54,170
I'm in my own state of Louisiana.
I don't know.

3001
02:10:54,171 --> 02:10:56,390
Everyone know what came of this,
you own Louisiana.

3002
02:10:56,450 --> 02:10:59,630
I did back then sarah.
It's my own state.

3003
02:10:59,780 --> 02:11:01,760
Just like you own him.
I only Louisiana.

3004
02:11:02,240 --> 02:11:03,800
Um,
no,

3005
02:11:03,801 --> 02:11:04,730
but uh,
in,

3006
02:11:04,770 --> 02:11:08,180
in when I was living in Louisiana at the
time I was watching some local news shit

3007
02:11:08,181 --> 02:11:10,190
and um,
they,

3008
02:11:10,330 --> 02:11:14,930
they wanted to do dna evidence to.
There was a guy who was a in there for

3009
02:11:15,200 --> 02:11:20,200
rape and murder and he said,
I want a dna test done to prove my

3010
02:11:20,391 --> 02:11:24,230
innocence and you know,
the da got on and said,

3011
02:11:24,231 --> 02:11:28,490
well we can't do that dna test because
if we do it and it turns out he is

3012
02:11:28,491 --> 02:11:30,110
innocent,
we look bad.

3013
02:11:30,980 --> 02:11:32,730
Like that's literally like the,
the,

3014
02:11:32,760 --> 02:11:35,150
that's not the subutex.
That's not like,

3015
02:11:35,151 --> 02:11:35,660
well,
you know,

3016
02:11:35,660 --> 02:11:37,120
we better come up with some bullshit
reason.

3017
02:11:37,130 --> 02:11:38,420
[inaudible] will look bad if this
happens.

3018
02:11:38,421 --> 02:11:41,690
No,
his overt reason for not doing the dna

3019
02:11:41,691 --> 02:11:45,830
test is maybe you know,
we might actually exonerate this guy and

3020
02:11:45,831 --> 02:11:48,440
make ourselves look like idiots who just
punished him for years.

3021
02:11:48,441 --> 02:11:49,940
Uselessly,
oh,

3022
02:11:50,770 --> 02:11:54,590
you're callousness now towards thIs
situation isn't exactly helping matters.

3023
02:11:54,710 --> 02:11:55,910
Is it?
It's terrifying.

3024
02:11:55,940 --> 02:11:58,160
I don't know how that turned out though,
but you know,

3025
02:11:58,260 --> 02:11:59,480
you see that shit all the time.
I,

3026
02:11:59,540 --> 02:12:01,850
the justice system is fucked.
It's fucked up.

3027
02:12:01,880 --> 02:12:04,040
Well,
people having too much is fucked.

3028
02:12:04,250 --> 02:12:07,070
People having the power to decide who's
guilty and who's innocent based on

3029
02:12:07,071 --> 02:12:09,350
withholding information or,
or releasing it.

3030
02:12:10,120 --> 02:12:11,480
Sensibility.
I don't know.

3031
02:12:11,630 --> 02:12:14,510
It's a really good question.
But in that situation,

3032
02:12:14,540 --> 02:12:17,150
it's not a good system.
It's a terrible system.

3033
02:12:17,420 --> 02:12:20,850
If they could withhold evidence and not
be god damn it.

3034
02:12:20,880 --> 02:12:25,880
What a dark thing that has to do to know
someone who's innocent and send him to

3035
02:12:25,940 --> 02:12:30,200
die in a fucking cement sell because you
don't want to get caught fucking up or

3036
02:12:30,201 --> 02:12:32,840
you didn't want to.
It's so terrifying.

3037
02:12:32,900 --> 02:12:35,030
They want to have the case.
They wanna be able to say,

3038
02:12:35,031 --> 02:12:36,160
case closed,
you know?

3039
02:12:36,510 --> 02:12:37,460
Well,
it's like a.

3040
02:12:37,690 --> 02:12:38,451
Who was it?
Uh,

3041
02:12:38,451 --> 02:12:39,950
was it ed gain?
No,

3042
02:12:40,010 --> 02:12:42,050
it wasn't at gain.
Uh,

3043
02:12:42,740 --> 02:12:46,550
there was some serial killer that maybe
you'll know who I'm talking about when

3044
02:12:46,551 --> 02:12:48,260
they found out that he was going around.
Really?

3045
02:12:48,290 --> 02:12:49,130
Lucas?
Yeah.

3046
02:12:49,131 --> 02:12:51,230
They found out he was going around
killing people and shit and they

3047
02:12:51,231 --> 02:12:51,891
decided,
you know,

3048
02:12:51,891 --> 02:12:54,830
we got all these unsolved murders on the
books and we could just pIn them on him.

3049
02:12:54,831 --> 02:12:57,440
They had him like a confessed to the
murders,

3050
02:12:57,441 --> 02:13:00,680
like as if he did like a murderer in,
like,

3051
02:13:00,681 --> 02:13:03,290
you know,
san francisco one day,

3052
02:13:03,291 --> 02:13:06,620
and then like New York city five hours
later and shit,

3053
02:13:06,621 --> 02:13:10,010
just any murder case around the country
that was closed,

3054
02:13:10,011 --> 02:13:11,420
that was passkey to them.
They just say,

3055
02:13:11,421 --> 02:13:12,410
oh yeah,
it was,

3056
02:13:12,620 --> 02:13:15,740
it was Henry Lee lucas.
He'd done it and he would go to the

3057
02:13:15,741 --> 02:13:19,100
scene and he'd,
they feed him information and then he'd

3058
02:13:19,101 --> 02:13:23,270
feed the same information back to them
and he got to be like celebrity serial

3059
02:13:23,271 --> 02:13:25,370
killer.
Created a mythology behind them that led

3060
02:13:25,371 --> 02:13:27,230
to a movie henry portrait of a serial
killer.

3061
02:13:27,231 --> 02:13:27,620
Yeah.
Yeah.

3062
02:13:27,620 --> 02:13:30,710
Which was the guy from the walking dead.
The brother that got his hand caught off

3063
02:13:30,711 --> 02:13:31,840
and the walking dead.
Oh really?

3064
02:13:31,841 --> 02:13:32,040
Yeah.

3065
02:13:32,040 --> 02:13:33,810
What the fuck is his name?
Really good dude.

3066
02:13:33,811 --> 02:13:37,050
He's using merle great actor.
I don't know they not the crossbow guy,

3067
02:13:37,051 --> 02:13:39,360
but his brother is one of the
interesting.

3068
02:13:39,740 --> 02:13:42,600
I don't remember the name of the.
I forget the guy's name,

3069
02:13:42,601 --> 02:13:44,610
but he's an michael rooker.
Yes.

3070
02:13:44,611 --> 02:13:46,980
Awesome actor.
He was Henry Lee lucas.

3071
02:13:47,520 --> 02:13:50,430
Henry lucas was this terrifying,
violent,

3072
02:13:50,490 --> 02:13:52,800
ruthless vicious man on the real
headline.

3073
02:13:52,801 --> 02:13:56,020
Really?
Lucas was this little shifty shufly

3074
02:13:56,040 --> 02:14:00,270
fucking hustler character who's just
really fucked up and lost and they made

3075
02:14:00,271 --> 02:14:02,310
him out to be.
This mom killed maybe like three or four

3076
02:14:02,311 --> 02:14:04,200
people maybe.
Who knows?

3077
02:14:04,201 --> 02:14:04,801
I mean,
well,

3078
02:14:04,801 --> 02:14:06,690
he killed his mother for sure.
I believe.

3079
02:14:07,440 --> 02:14:08,540
Maybe.
I Don't know.

3080
02:14:08,800 --> 02:14:10,710
I'm not positive.
I'm not one of these people that's

3081
02:14:10,720 --> 02:14:13,410
obsessed with serial killers and shit,
but that's just another example of like

3082
02:14:13,890 --> 02:14:18,520
law enforcement gone crazy.
There is in the movie fellow was a

3083
02:14:19,410 --> 02:14:20,520
really good movie though.

3084
02:14:20,840 --> 02:14:22,290
It's a.
It's an interesting movie.

3085
02:14:22,620 --> 02:14:26,070
It's,
I'm in a lot of ways it reminded me of

3086
02:14:26,071 --> 02:14:30,990
that fucked up movie where brad pitt
played was a California where brad pitt

3087
02:14:31,050 --> 02:14:33,180
played a.
I'm a serial killer.

3088
02:14:34,080 --> 02:14:35,880
So with California,
with a k?

3089
02:14:35,881 --> 02:14:36,451
Yeah.
Yeah,

3090
02:14:36,451 --> 02:14:37,560
yeah.
That was a,

3091
02:14:37,561 --> 02:14:40,170
it was a dark movie.
It was fun because they didn't go with

3092
02:14:40,171 --> 02:14:42,840
the usual,
like super genius serial killer either.

3093
02:14:42,841 --> 02:14:44,450
They made him kind of like,
you know,

3094
02:14:44,460 --> 02:14:46,780
just a simple guy.
Yeah.

3095
02:14:46,890 --> 02:14:49,780
Which is probably more likely.
Yeah.

3096
02:14:49,800 --> 02:14:51,330
I mean,
I guess they say that serial killers

3097
02:14:51,331 --> 02:14:54,780
have above average iq was.
But the hannibal lecter archetype is not

3098
02:14:54,781 --> 02:14:57,690
really accurate.
Did you see that fucking thing where

3099
02:14:57,691 --> 02:15:02,460
they showed that more money has been
taken from americans from the police

3100
02:15:02,640 --> 02:15:05,670
then from burglars in 2015?
It doesn't surprise me.

3101
02:15:05,910 --> 02:15:09,160
There's plenty of laws.
There's plenty of laws that say you can,

3102
02:15:09,360 --> 02:15:10,320
you know,
uh,

3103
02:15:11,010 --> 02:15:13,650
I don't know what the amount is or how
many states allow this,

3104
02:15:13,651 --> 02:15:17,880
but basically they can just sees any
amount of money up to a certain amount

3105
02:15:17,910 --> 02:15:19,830
or more than $1,000 or something.

3106
02:15:19,830 --> 02:15:20,471
He just say,
well,

3107
02:15:20,471 --> 02:15:22,090
oh,
this is oBviously drug money received

3108
02:15:22,210 --> 02:15:24,780
for evidence and you know,
you could be on your way to buy a car.

3109
02:15:25,380 --> 02:15:26,040
You,
you know,

3110
02:15:26,040 --> 02:15:28,230
you've got a craigslist ad guy selling a
car.

3111
02:15:28,231 --> 02:15:29,310
Okay,
I'm on my way over.

3112
02:15:29,410 --> 02:15:30,510
You bring cash.
Okay.

3113
02:15:30,511 --> 02:15:33,860
I'll go to the back when I was a kid,
my dad was rIch and he would carry like

3114
02:15:33,900 --> 02:15:38,760
$15,000 around in his wallet ball and
big money,

3115
02:15:38,761 --> 02:15:41,710
you know,
did he have like crazy shoes and like a

3116
02:15:41,720 --> 02:15:45,960
lot of times he was like stupid looking
silk shirts and shit.

3117
02:15:46,770 --> 02:15:50,540
He looked like some kind of decadent
roman emperor and he always had big

3118
02:15:50,550 --> 02:15:54,810
orgies at his house to dad is cool.
He was cool.

3119
02:15:55,170 --> 02:15:58,170
What did he do for a living?
He was pretty much a con man.

3120
02:15:58,440 --> 02:15:59,550
Whoa.
Really?

3121
02:15:59,760 --> 02:16:04,140
Where uh,
he started as a diploma mill called

3122
02:16:04,170 --> 02:16:07,380
lasalle university.
Did you?

3123
02:16:08,580 --> 02:16:09,990
Shit,
I don't believe you,

3124
02:16:10,020 --> 02:16:12,440
but.
No,

3125
02:16:12,530 --> 02:16:13,920
no,
he just started.

3126
02:16:13,950 --> 02:16:17,640
He started a fake university degree
mill,

3127
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,100
you know,
it kind of,

3128
02:16:20,400 --> 02:16:25,230
you could say in some ways maybe it was
fake or maybe it was just a precursor to

3129
02:16:25,231 --> 02:16:28,550
things like phoenix,
university of phoenix that just,

3130
02:16:28,560 --> 02:16:30,250
you know,
but his real problem

3131
02:16:30,250 --> 02:16:33,520
wasn't the school.
It was the government never went after

3132
02:16:33,521 --> 02:16:35,260
him and said,
you're running a scam school.

3133
02:16:35,261 --> 02:16:40,090
The government went after him for,
for committing mail fraud and for um,

3134
02:16:40,630 --> 02:16:44,320
a tax evasion was the big one because he
didn't feel like he had to pay any taxes

3135
02:16:44,770 --> 02:16:47,620
they felt otherwise.
So he ended up in jail for,

3136
02:16:47,621 --> 02:16:49,090
um,
you know,

3137
02:16:49,091 --> 02:16:53,230
three or four years over that will
actually was sentenced to five years,

3138
02:16:53,231 --> 02:16:55,840
but then he claims to be a drug addict
even though he wasn't,

3139
02:16:55,841 --> 02:17:00,130
never did drugs and they gave him some
time off his sentence for enrolling in a

3140
02:17:00,131 --> 02:17:02,020
drug treatment program.
God,

3141
02:17:02,021 --> 02:17:04,030
that's awesome.
He was always lookIng for the angles.

3142
02:17:04,031 --> 02:17:06,040
I wish I had that ability like my dad
did.

3143
02:17:06,070 --> 02:17:07,360
Is he still around?
Now?

3144
02:17:07,361 --> 02:17:08,590
He's dead.
Uh.

3145
02:17:08,600 --> 02:17:10,150
Is your mom still around?
Yes.

3146
02:17:10,151 --> 02:17:11,610
When you talked to your mom about him,
like,

3147
02:17:11,720 --> 02:17:13,150
like how long were they together?

3148
02:17:13,780 --> 02:17:14,800
Uh,
you know,

3149
02:17:14,810 --> 02:17:18,160
I think about maybe eight or nine years.
Wow.

3150
02:17:18,190 --> 02:17:20,710
What a,
what a blessed be like to be a woman and

3151
02:17:20,711 --> 02:17:25,130
to have a child with a crazy man who's
running around just scamming people and

3152
02:17:25,510 --> 02:17:26,860
hustling.
You know what I mean?

3153
02:17:27,340 --> 02:17:29,140
It wasn't like he was really scamming
people.

3154
02:17:29,141 --> 02:17:32,410
He was actually helping people to scam
employers.

3155
02:17:32,411 --> 02:17:36,060
If
they know the degree is fucking bogus.

3156
02:17:36,070 --> 02:17:37,390
Right.
That's a good point.

3157
02:17:38,590 --> 02:17:40,960
And actually it was crazy because when
it was exposed,

3158
02:17:40,961 --> 02:17:45,820
there was like congressman and you know,
they got their degree,

3159
02:17:45,840 --> 02:17:50,840
like ceos of major companies that all
had degrees from lasalle university.

3160
02:17:51,580 --> 02:17:54,400
Super successful even with fake degrees.
Yeah.

3161
02:17:54,460 --> 02:17:55,780
That's hilarious.
Well,

3162
02:17:55,781 --> 02:17:57,880
you know what,
degrees are bullshit anyway.

3163
02:17:58,210 --> 02:18:01,330
Well,
they certainly are not the only limiting

3164
02:18:01,331 --> 02:18:03,220
factor in someone's competency.
Yeah.

3165
02:18:03,221 --> 02:18:04,630
I mean,
especially not for like business or

3166
02:18:04,631 --> 02:18:06,880
something science.
Maybe that's a different story.

3167
02:18:06,910 --> 02:18:08,110
I'll for sure.
Medicine.

3168
02:18:08,170 --> 02:18:09,210
Yeah.
You want a real document?

3169
02:18:09,211 --> 02:18:10,090
We don't want,
you know,

3170
02:18:10,320 --> 02:18:14,330
a doctor with a lasalle medical degree
with an incomplete idea and I don't

3171
02:18:14,331 --> 02:18:15,190
think,
I don't think he,

3172
02:18:15,191 --> 02:18:15,770
uh,
he,

3173
02:18:15,770 --> 02:18:18,700
he issued medical degrees though.
Well,

3174
02:18:19,060 --> 02:18:21,880
either way,
that's not the most egregious example of

3175
02:18:21,881 --> 02:18:23,420
someone being a con person.
That's not.

3176
02:18:23,430 --> 02:18:24,071
No,
I mean,

3177
02:18:24,071 --> 02:18:27,460
uh,
there's probably way worse things,

3178
02:18:27,760 --> 02:18:29,020
but you know what I mean.
Yeah.

3179
02:18:29,320 --> 02:18:31,930
But he was an interesting guy though and
actually,

3180
02:18:31,931 --> 02:18:33,040
you know,
when he was dying,

3181
02:18:33,041 --> 02:18:35,470
when he was on his death,
he died of a super massive heart attack

3182
02:18:35,471 --> 02:18:37,540
at the age of 61,
you know,

3183
02:18:37,541 --> 02:18:39,550
basically I was sitting there at my
desk,

3184
02:18:39,551 --> 02:18:42,190
uh,
working for him on whatever he was doing

3185
02:18:42,550 --> 02:18:45,520
and my step mom comes and she taps me on
the shoulder and she's like,

3186
02:18:45,521 --> 02:18:47,590
something is seriously wrong with your
father.

3187
02:18:47,591 --> 02:18:52,591
And I follow her and he's sitting there
on the bed and he's just like a,

3188
02:18:53,790 --> 02:18:56,050
I'm like a dad,
are you okay?

3189
02:18:57,370 --> 02:18:58,270
I'm like,
oh shit.

3190
02:18:58,271 --> 02:19:00,540
We called nine slash 11,
uh,

3191
02:19:00,700 --> 02:19:02,020
took him to the hospital,
that stuff.

3192
02:19:02,021 --> 02:19:05,860
And that was reallY the moment when he's
lying there in the hospital bed and

3193
02:19:05,861 --> 02:19:06,820
everyone's saying,
you know,

3194
02:19:06,821 --> 02:19:08,820
he's fucked and you know,
this,

3195
02:19:09,490 --> 02:19:10,810
there's not,
you know,

3196
02:19:11,410 --> 02:19:13,390
his,
his wife is kind of align yourself and

3197
02:19:13,391 --> 02:19:15,640
saying like,
we'll be laughing about this tomorrow,

3198
02:19:15,641 --> 02:19:17,050
but not really believe in it.
And shit.

3199
02:19:17,130 --> 02:19:20,860
Well she knew she was in the will,
but there was no will.

3200
02:19:20,980 --> 02:19:22,120
Oh,
unfortunatelY.

3201
02:19:22,121 --> 02:19:25,060
But
anyway,

3202
02:19:25,300 --> 02:19:30,300
that was probably the only time in at
least my adult life that I ever prayed

3203
02:19:30,831 --> 02:19:33,210
or anything like that because I did,
you know,

3204
02:19:33,230 --> 02:19:36,440
even as a staunch atheIst and a strong
skeptic,

3205
02:19:36,520 --> 02:19:39,320
you know,
I was emotionally moved enough at that

3206
02:19:39,321 --> 02:19:43,520
time to prostrate myself before I or
power and say,

3207
02:19:43,760 --> 02:19:45,440
you know,
if there is something out there,

3208
02:19:45,890 --> 02:19:48,260
you know,
could you change this outcome?

3209
02:19:48,290 --> 02:19:50,060
Didn't happen.
Um,

3210
02:19:50,860 --> 02:19:53,560
maybe you didn't pray Hard enough or you
didn't really believe I didn't really

3211
02:19:53,561 --> 02:19:54,950
see people right now that are mad at
you.

3212
02:19:55,130 --> 02:19:56,630
I didn't pray hard.
And if you say that,

3213
02:19:56,780 --> 02:19:57,920
but we'll think about what you just
said.

3214
02:19:58,010 --> 02:19:59,660
How many people right now are going to
be mad at you for that?

3215
02:19:59,810 --> 02:20:02,180
You call yourself the amazing atheist
because god took your dad.

3216
02:20:02,690 --> 02:20:04,550
No,
I was calling myself tHe amazing atheist

3217
02:20:04,551 --> 02:20:06,590
before that I know,
but can imagine being the amazing

3218
02:20:06,591 --> 02:20:10,790
atheist and then in when,
when the test comes from a where I

3219
02:20:10,791 --> 02:20:12,830
failed the test.
Luckily,

3220
02:20:12,980 --> 02:20:15,890
luckily atheism doesn't have any built
in tests or anything like that.

3221
02:20:15,970 --> 02:20:17,250
It does.
Now I just.

3222
02:20:17,300 --> 02:20:20,720
What do you think about atheism plus is
that you are,

3223
02:20:20,990 --> 02:20:21,501
okay,
well,

3224
02:20:21,501 --> 02:20:25,160
if you're going to define sjw to people,
you've got to define atheism plus to

3225
02:20:25,161 --> 02:20:27,860
people because if they don't know sjw,
they certainly don't know atheism.

3226
02:20:27,860 --> 02:20:32,860
Plus atheism plus is a very weird little
offset group of atheists who want to

3227
02:20:34,401 --> 02:20:39,401
connect atheism with a bunch of moral
and ethical beliefs.

3228
02:20:39,800 --> 02:20:41,720
So in other words,
it's a cult.

3229
02:20:42,440 --> 02:20:43,070
Yeah.
And uh,

3230
02:20:43,070 --> 02:20:45,200
you know,
it's mostly a,

3231
02:20:45,210 --> 02:20:47,240
it's mostly just due to feminist
infiltration,

3232
02:20:47,600 --> 02:20:52,100
but If you look at what they've done to
the speaking circuit,

3233
02:20:52,101 --> 02:20:57,080
the atheist speaking straight like this
used to be like hot shit that attracted

3234
02:20:57,081 --> 02:20:59,450
thousands of people.
They wanted to see christopher hitchens.

3235
02:20:59,451 --> 02:21:01,880
They want to see richard dawkins,
they wanted to see sam harris.

3236
02:21:01,881 --> 02:21:04,250
They want to see daniel dennett.
They want to see all these like big

3237
02:21:04,251 --> 02:21:09,170
towering intellectuals deliver this
fucking iconic classic message and an

3238
02:21:09,171 --> 02:21:12,200
entertaining and compelling passionate
way.

3239
02:21:12,440 --> 02:21:15,800
And now you look at the conferences and
it's fucking,

3240
02:21:16,490 --> 02:21:21,490
I am a cis gendered white male and I
recognize that as such.

3241
02:21:22,641 --> 02:21:25,310
I have a lot of privilege here on this
panel.

3242
02:21:26,390 --> 02:21:29,390
It's gone from fucking christopher
hitchens to that.

3243
02:21:29,391 --> 02:21:32,030
And as a result,
attendance has dwindled.

3244
02:21:32,031 --> 02:21:34,430
It's shit.
These people still have something of an

3245
02:21:34,431 --> 02:21:37,850
online presence,
mostly spearheaded by a guy named um,

3246
02:21:37,880 --> 02:21:41,750
pz myers a hates my guts.
Hates everybody.

3247
02:21:41,751 --> 02:21:42,660
Really.
Um,

3248
02:21:43,010 --> 02:21:44,510
there's a lot of hate coming from that
dude.

3249
02:21:44,760 --> 02:21:46,790
yeah.
He's a very hateful fuck and you know,

3250
02:21:46,791 --> 02:21:48,070
I don't have no problem with them.
Look,

3251
02:21:48,200 --> 02:21:51,080
if you want to have atheism plus and you
want to be like,

3252
02:21:51,530 --> 02:21:54,860
we're atheism plus all this other shit,
fine by me,

3253
02:21:54,920 --> 02:21:57,470
have fun,
but you know,

3254
02:21:57,610 --> 02:22:00,770
you don't get to come to me and be like,
you're already to be atheism.

3255
02:22:00,771 --> 02:22:05,771
Plus thIs idea of shaming people into
changing or shaming people that somehow

3256
02:22:07,311 --> 02:22:08,740
or another you're writing.
Well,

3257
02:22:08,780 --> 02:22:10,220
that's how you become a warrIor,
right?

3258
02:22:10,430 --> 02:22:13,790
You have to go out and attack.
You have to shame people for their

3259
02:22:13,910 --> 02:22:18,770
differing viewpoints or sexist opinions
like big on sexism.

3260
02:22:18,770 --> 02:22:20,540
Very.
That's like one of the number one,

3261
02:22:20,570 --> 02:22:22,790
uh,
attacks they'll uh,

3262
02:22:22,820 --> 02:22:26,610
they'll use Is going after sexists like
and shaming them,

3263
02:22:26,640 --> 02:22:28,470
shaming them in some way,
hurting them,

3264
02:22:28,471 --> 02:22:30,870
lashing out,
making them feel that pain.

3265
02:22:31,020 --> 02:22:35,250
And it seems like a way of bullying in
response to the bullying that they've

3266
02:22:35,251 --> 02:22:36,990
experienced,
like dave experience,

3267
02:22:37,140 --> 02:22:39,150
negativity.
so they've decided to turn that

3268
02:22:39,151 --> 02:22:41,700
negativity on people they feel deserve
it.

3269
02:22:41,730 --> 02:22:43,140
You know,
I noticed uses that bullying,

3270
02:22:43,170 --> 02:22:48,170
that uh,
that shaming tactic to milo bEcause,

3271
02:22:48,191 --> 02:22:48,530
you know,
he,

3272
02:22:48,530 --> 02:22:48,930
he,
you know,

3273
02:22:48,930 --> 02:22:51,900
he pulled this,
he pulled something on your show where

3274
02:22:51,901 --> 02:22:54,450
he did this thing,
this little bit where he's like,

3275
02:22:54,840 --> 02:22:57,480
you and him got in an argument maybe
about circumcision or something like

3276
02:22:57,481 --> 02:22:58,560
that.
And he's like,

3277
02:22:59,070 --> 02:23:02,340
I can't believe you of all people would
argue with me on,

3278
02:23:02,370 --> 02:23:04,560
you know,
and he tried that same shit on our show.

3279
02:23:04,560 --> 02:23:07,620
So he has this weird thing where like,
eh,

3280
02:23:07,820 --> 02:23:09,690
it's,
it's a really interesting rhetorical

3281
02:23:09,691 --> 02:23:14,691
trick because not only does it shame you
for not apparently being as extreme on

3282
02:23:15,511 --> 02:23:19,950
the issue as he is,
but it also bolsters itself is like,

3283
02:23:19,951 --> 02:23:23,340
look,
joe rogan doesn't even have the balls to

3284
02:23:23,341 --> 02:23:27,270
say what I milo yiannopoulos.
Say the drunken peasants podcast doesn't

3285
02:23:27,271 --> 02:23:31,470
have the balls to say what I milo
yiannopoulos saying because I think it's

3286
02:23:31,471 --> 02:23:33,820
just a clever debating tactic.
It's just he's,

3287
02:23:33,920 --> 02:23:36,560
he's trying to win and these guys,
when he's having fun,

3288
02:23:36,670 --> 02:23:38,010
it's effective,
but you know,

3289
02:23:38,070 --> 02:23:39,840
that's why I got to call that shit
because,

3290
02:23:39,841 --> 02:23:41,250
you know,
we can't let them get away with it

3291
02:23:41,251 --> 02:23:42,450
forever.
I see what you're saying.

3292
02:23:42,451 --> 02:23:46,410
If you only looked at him as being a
rational debate or I look at him as

3293
02:23:46,411 --> 02:23:49,230
being a theater.
He's what he is.

3294
02:23:49,231 --> 02:23:50,880
His problem is that,
you know,

3295
02:23:51,010 --> 02:23:52,490
on when he was on our show,
you know,

3296
02:23:52,520 --> 02:23:54,270
we had our,
one of our guys,

3297
02:23:54,271 --> 02:23:55,830
paul,
very popular,

3298
02:23:55,831 --> 02:23:57,720
I got a guy on our show,
uh,

3299
02:23:58,200 --> 02:23:59,670
you know,
attacking his arguments,

3300
02:23:59,960 --> 02:24:01,620
treat them like you would treat any
other guests,

3301
02:24:02,280 --> 02:24:06,180
but you know,
the milo fanboys or like how dare you

3302
02:24:06,181 --> 02:24:09,300
challenge the perfect walk,
kick of by.

3303
02:24:09,300 --> 02:24:12,240
Whoa.
It's like he doesn't have perfect lodge.

3304
02:24:12,241 --> 02:24:15,390
I think he's a smart guy.
He's an entertaining guy.

3305
02:24:15,450 --> 02:24:17,640
He's compelling,
but eh,

3306
02:24:17,780 --> 02:24:20,900
he's not completely 100 percent
objective dicks.

3307
02:24:21,440 --> 02:24:26,440
So didn't know anybody is circumcision
and he hates his own sexuality too.

3308
02:24:28,050 --> 02:24:29,690
Well,
I don't know how much that's real.

3309
02:24:30,580 --> 02:24:32,790
I think it's real sincere.
It,

3310
02:24:33,350 --> 02:24:35,670
it's hard to know when you delve into
religion with him too.

3311
02:24:35,671 --> 02:24:37,410
I don't know if you guys got into that
very much.

3312
02:24:37,411 --> 02:24:39,450
It's pretty ridiculous,
but I think that's.

3313
02:24:39,500 --> 02:24:41,970
I think that's connected though.
I think you know the hustle.

3314
02:24:42,330 --> 02:24:43,860
No,
I think he's sincere.

3315
02:24:45,570 --> 02:24:47,250
I think it's a hustle.
It's a hustle.

3316
02:24:47,770 --> 02:24:50,310
I want to be conservative.
You want to be respected and

3317
02:24:50,311 --> 02:24:53,280
conservative.
Circles need to be down with the baby

3318
02:24:53,281 --> 02:24:54,450
jesus.
You have to.

3319
02:24:55,040 --> 02:24:58,920
That's almost the only point of entry
that's undeniable.

3320
02:24:58,921 --> 02:25:03,921
You cannot be an atheist.
I got a staunch atheist advocate for

3321
02:25:04,351 --> 02:25:06,780
atheism,
plus being a republican.

3322
02:25:06,810 --> 02:25:09,000
They're not gonna let you in,
but you could be a gay guy.

3323
02:25:09,120 --> 02:25:11,460
He could be flamboyantly gay as long as
you have a sense of humor,

3324
02:25:11,520 --> 02:25:12,510
batteries,
fan,

3325
02:25:12,600 --> 02:25:17,600
and as long as you have plenty of self
loathing and wish you weren't and then

3326
02:25:17,820 --> 02:25:18,680
we'll let you in.
Well,

3327
02:25:18,690 --> 02:25:21,510
you know what we believe in jesus.
One thing that kinda does go to what

3328
02:25:21,511 --> 02:25:23,800
you're saying is that when he on our
show,

3329
02:25:23,801 --> 02:25:24,634
you know,

3330
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:30,000
he specIfically told us like let's try
not to talk about religion too much and

3331
02:25:30,400 --> 02:25:32,740
when he did talk about religion and he
was very,

3332
02:25:32,770 --> 02:25:36,610
it was easily the most evasive subjects,
so maybe maybe you're onto something

3333
02:25:36,611 --> 02:25:38,590
there.
He didn't want to get into it too much

3334
02:25:38,591 --> 02:25:42,580
with me either.
I think he would go to this whole thing

3335
02:25:42,581 --> 02:25:46,870
that judeo christian values or what this
country is founded upon and judeo

3336
02:25:46,871 --> 02:25:49,750
christian centered countries are the
best countries.

3337
02:25:49,751 --> 02:25:54,010
Like he had these talking points that he
did not want to debate or explore other

3338
02:25:54,011 --> 02:25:58,150
than repeat those premises and I felt
like there's a certain amount of him

3339
02:25:58,210 --> 02:26:01,420
that I just,
I just give in to the fact that a lot of

3340
02:26:01,421 --> 02:26:03,100
his theater and I think he's
entertaining.

3341
02:26:03,101 --> 02:26:06,310
It's almost like his brand of gonzo
journalism.

3342
02:26:06,460 --> 02:26:08,950
She's bran of gonzo.
Journalism is sort of this gay

3343
02:26:09,160 --> 02:26:10,950
self-loathing jesus believer.

3344
02:26:10,950 --> 02:26:15,950
Like he'll put stuff on twitter like a,
like something about people believing in

3345
02:26:16,241 --> 02:26:18,220
god.
The only smart people.

3346
02:26:18,340 --> 02:26:20,470
Like that's it.
Like the whole sentence and people.

3347
02:26:20,471 --> 02:26:21,760
Yes,
yes,

3348
02:26:21,940 --> 02:26:25,450
the fucking apes to start fucking
banging against the cage and

3349
02:26:25,451 --> 02:26:28,720
appreciation and I imagined that he's
laughing while this is all going on.

3350
02:26:28,721 --> 02:26:33,721
I can't imagine that a guy who's as
rational as he is fact based and driven

3351
02:26:34,780 --> 02:26:37,780
as his arguments are about so many
different things when it comes to

3352
02:26:37,781 --> 02:26:41,110
arguing against social justice warriors
or whatever the fuck it is,

3353
02:26:41,320 --> 02:26:45,380
but it against religion.
He has this giant blind spot and there's

3354
02:26:45,400 --> 02:26:48,010
the religion in question that he
chooses.

3355
02:26:48,220 --> 02:26:51,310
Thinks that he's an abomination,
like it's preposterous.

3356
02:26:51,640 --> 02:26:54,880
I think intellectually you could make
the argument that it's not theater.

3357
02:26:55,220 --> 02:26:59,050
I believe he's theater.
I think he's the dangerous faggot tour.

3358
02:26:59,051 --> 02:27:00,490
He's havIng a fun time with this whole
thing.

3359
02:27:00,490 --> 02:27:03,880
It's the whole thing is awesome.
I think it's awesome that the twitter

3360
02:27:03,881 --> 02:27:05,950
unverified have to.
They just fucking created a bigger

3361
02:27:05,951 --> 02:27:07,840
monster.
They just threw gasoline on a fire.

3362
02:27:07,841 --> 02:27:09,850
They fucked up.
Why?

3363
02:27:09,880 --> 02:27:11,680
Why do you think they don't see shit
like that though?

3364
02:27:11,710 --> 02:27:13,250
Because they're assholes.
Just say they're too.

3365
02:27:13,570 --> 02:27:16,630
They're too blinded by what assholes.
They are to realize that all they're

3366
02:27:16,631 --> 02:27:19,330
going to do is add to his popularity and
legend.

3367
02:27:19,480 --> 02:27:24,480
They must the people that made that
decision must harbor social justice

3368
02:27:25,031 --> 02:27:27,130
warrior ideals.
There is no question about it.

3369
02:27:27,131 --> 02:27:29,530
The other.
There's no way other than that that you

3370
02:27:29,531 --> 02:27:34,060
could look at what he's doing and and
say that this is a guy that you should

3371
02:27:34,090 --> 02:27:35,680
unverified.
I mean,

3372
02:27:36,070 --> 02:27:37,930
yOu have to do something to get banned,
right?

3373
02:27:37,931 --> 02:27:39,940
If do something mean you have to harass
someone.

3374
02:27:39,941 --> 02:27:41,950
You Have to call someone problems.
well,

3375
02:27:42,190 --> 02:27:44,080
someone can block you,
so if you're bugging them,

3376
02:27:44,110 --> 02:27:46,930
they can block you and then
theoretically at least you're not

3377
02:27:46,931 --> 02:27:49,000
experiencing their,
their bullshit anymore unless they start

3378
02:27:49,001 --> 02:27:49,834
new accounts.

3379
02:27:49,910 --> 02:27:51,760
So they didn't,
they didn't ban him.

3380
02:27:51,850 --> 02:27:53,440
They just unverified him.
Well,

3381
02:27:53,441 --> 02:27:55,930
that doesn't make any fucking sense
because you know exactly who he is.

3382
02:27:56,140 --> 02:27:59,170
Verification it's supposed to be done.
Is this guy a breitbart journalist,

3383
02:27:59,370 --> 02:28:00,203
but you.
Okay.

3384
02:28:00,250 --> 02:28:02,710
Donald trump has said horrendous shit
about mexicans.

3385
02:28:02,711 --> 02:28:04,690
He's fucking verified me.
Say they're all.

3386
02:28:04,960 --> 02:28:08,020
Someone's doing them raping,
like he's saying crazy shit about

3387
02:28:08,220 --> 02:28:12,790
fucking race of people that's connected
to us on a landmass and he's still

3388
02:28:12,791 --> 02:28:13,630
verified.
well,

3389
02:28:13,631 --> 02:28:15,530
why don't you unverified trump too?
Like what you.

3390
02:28:15,540 --> 02:28:17,560
What are you gonna do anytime.
Anytime someone says something

3391
02:28:17,561 --> 02:28:18,680
provocative.
Yeah.

3392
02:28:18,690 --> 02:28:22,190
I wasn't aware that the verification was
supposed to be a badge of

3393
02:28:22,190 --> 02:28:24,170
approval or anything.
It's supposed to be like,

3394
02:28:24,171 --> 02:28:26,210
here's a notable personality.

3395
02:28:26,420 --> 02:28:27,980
He's notable.
Yeah.

3396
02:28:28,010 --> 02:28:31,310
He's been on a podcast that was seen by
him or listened to by over a million

3397
02:28:31,311 --> 02:28:33,020
people.
That guy's notable.

3398
02:28:33,320 --> 02:28:37,280
He's got a bright bart column that gets
hundreds of thousands of fucking views.

3399
02:28:37,460 --> 02:28:40,150
He's notable.
What are you doing?

3400
02:28:40,190 --> 02:28:41,570
Twitter,
what are you doing?

3401
02:28:41,730 --> 02:28:44,630
It doesn't make any sense and I've never
heard of him doing it before.

3402
02:28:44,960 --> 02:28:47,810
I never heard of doing it before either.
I don't think they have done it before

3403
02:28:47,910 --> 02:28:51,630
and they have definitely band people,
people that there's people that deserve

3404
02:28:51,631 --> 02:28:53,210
to be removed,
but there are assholes,

3405
02:28:53,540 --> 02:28:55,970
you know?
They were ruined in ruining what twitter

3406
02:28:55,971 --> 02:28:57,740
has established,
which is a really fucking cool

3407
02:28:57,741 --> 02:28:59,420
community.
Twitter is amazing.

3408
02:28:59,600 --> 02:29:04,600
I get everyday I get cool stories and
interesting articles and interesting

3409
02:29:05,181 --> 02:29:09,260
bits of information or corrections where
people will tell me about things we've

3410
02:29:09,261 --> 02:29:13,220
talked about on the podcast and most of
the time it's really polite and I find

3411
02:29:13,221 --> 02:29:15,650
my interactions on twitter to be really
cool.

3412
02:29:15,650 --> 02:29:20,030
I mean I enjoy it a lot.
I get a lot of like really cool website

3413
02:29:20,031 --> 02:29:20,990
referrals.
Like someone say,

3414
02:29:20,991 --> 02:29:24,530
you got to check this out or check out
this musician or check out this artist.

3415
02:29:24,780 --> 02:29:27,920
Lot of really cool stuff is being
exchanged through twitter,

3416
02:29:28,400 --> 02:29:33,400
but you can't take a guy like that who's
so obviously entertaining and having fun

3417
02:29:34,821 --> 02:29:37,820
and fucking with people and has some
points that he actually believes in.

3418
02:29:38,030 --> 02:29:40,790
Where's he crossing a line?
He's not crossing a line where you can

3419
02:29:40,791 --> 02:29:44,840
ban him like he's not advocating
violence or hate or going after someone

3420
02:29:44,841 --> 02:29:48,770
or doxing them or doing something that
we would all agree is fucked up.

3421
02:29:48,890 --> 02:29:50,780
So what Is going on here?
Like what?

3422
02:29:50,781 --> 02:29:53,810
What is going on here?
Why are you taking them down while

3423
02:29:53,811 --> 02:29:55,490
you're taking the little blue checklist
off

3424
02:29:57,030 --> 02:29:59,130
what I was asking you?
I don't understand it.

3425
02:29:59,430 --> 02:30:01,080
It doesn't make any sense.
I mean,

3426
02:30:01,110 --> 02:30:02,730
especially when you consider it.
Like I said,

3427
02:30:02,731 --> 02:30:05,590
it's not a badge of approval.
It's not we endorse.

3428
02:30:05,591 --> 02:30:09,540
This is just saying this is the real
milo yiannopoulos,

3429
02:30:10,040 --> 02:30:13,920
like are they taking away his identity?
Are they saying that's not who he is

3430
02:30:13,921 --> 02:30:17,190
anymore or that you know,
that being that is not notable.

3431
02:30:17,490 --> 02:30:21,540
I mean he's a breitbart journalist.
He has one of the largest and most fast

3432
02:30:21,541 --> 02:30:24,290
growing twitter followings of all time.
Yeah.

3433
02:30:24,900 --> 02:30:27,220
I mean like almost all of his twitter
subscribe.

3434
02:30:27,270 --> 02:30:30,720
Here's twitter followers which are like
massive dwarfing dwarfing.

3435
02:30:30,721 --> 02:30:34,740
Mine are in the last like 18,
19 months.

3436
02:30:34,890 --> 02:30:37,050
Yeah.
Like this guy has exploded onto the

3437
02:30:37,051 --> 02:30:38,820
scene.
Well he got 20,000 thIs week.

3438
02:30:39,060 --> 02:30:40,830
Yeah.
Just from this whole debacle.

3439
02:30:40,860 --> 02:30:41,670
Yeah.

3440
02:30:41,670 --> 02:30:44,020
Guy,
we need interesting people out there in

3441
02:30:44,021 --> 02:30:48,910
this World and when people have
disagreements or different opinions

3442
02:30:49,090 --> 02:30:51,880
about certain subjects tHat are
controversial and pertinent because

3443
02:30:51,881 --> 02:30:54,580
we're all discussing them,
whether it's men's rights or women's

3444
02:30:54,581 --> 02:30:57,220
rights or whatever the fuck it is,
you're going to have controversial

3445
02:30:57,221 --> 02:31:00,070
characters who stand out and their their
hot points of debate.

3446
02:31:00,071 --> 02:31:01,420
That's this guy is,
you know,

3447
02:31:01,570 --> 02:31:03,730
you might not agree with them,
you might think he's an asshole,

3448
02:31:03,910 --> 02:31:05,650
you might not want to read his tweets
anymore,

3449
02:31:05,651 --> 02:31:07,630
so you block them.
That's all fair play,

3450
02:31:07,900 --> 02:31:10,450
but it's as soon as they decide,
like I've said,

3451
02:31:10,451 --> 02:31:13,000
some pretty fucked up shit on twitter
before just to get a rise out of april

3452
02:31:13,240 --> 02:31:17,320
and like is that we're going to decide
that this am I going to be unverified

3453
02:31:17,321 --> 02:31:20,760
now it's going to be a bunch of fake
news out and one of them just happen to

3454
02:31:20,761 --> 02:31:23,970
have one point 7 million followers.
You got to find the guy with the most

3455
02:31:23,971 --> 02:31:25,530
followers to figure out who's the real
guy.

3456
02:31:25,740 --> 02:31:27,840
That's stupid.
You're ruining your community.

3457
02:31:28,420 --> 02:31:31,200
You will allowing someone,
the fact that you allow.

3458
02:31:31,320 --> 02:31:34,080
Like I could call myself the amazing
atheist in my heading.

3459
02:31:34,290 --> 02:31:36,640
I could have my same twitter handle and
just start crying.

3460
02:31:37,170 --> 02:31:38,003
Yeah,

3461
02:31:38,680 --> 02:31:39,610
I'm sitting here.
Yeah,

3462
02:31:39,620 --> 02:31:40,441
that's the.
That's another thing.

3463
02:31:40,441 --> 02:31:42,960
You know,
I'm sitting in a channel that has nearly

3464
02:31:42,961 --> 02:31:47,961
800,000 followers is getting four to 5
million views a month every month for

3465
02:31:49,530 --> 02:31:50,570
twitter.
You know,

3466
02:31:50,580 --> 02:31:53,090
and I'm not verified.
Where's my verification?

3467
02:31:53,130 --> 02:31:56,480
I'm the real fucking amazing atheist.
YOu are dude.

3468
02:31:56,550 --> 02:31:59,460
No verification,
but you kind of a rebel doll.

3469
02:31:59,470 --> 02:32:01,950
you're on the outside.
Maybe it's better like tHis know stay

3470
02:32:01,960 --> 02:32:04,680
underground.
You don't want to be that band that used

3471
02:32:04,681 --> 02:32:07,650
to be cool and now like people don't
like it because you're already know I've

3472
02:32:07,651 --> 02:32:10,470
already experienced that bullshit.
Have you sold yet?

3473
02:32:10,800 --> 02:32:11,341
No,
I haven't.

3474
02:32:11,341 --> 02:32:12,690
I mean I'm not sold out,
but.

3475
02:32:12,710 --> 02:32:14,580
Well maybe a little here and there.
Product placements.

3476
02:32:14,610 --> 02:32:17,760
Sure.
I guess I have sold out a little,

3477
02:32:17,761 --> 02:32:20,010
but the thing is though.
No,

3478
02:32:20,040 --> 02:32:25,040
I'm more talking about like the people
coming up from below that are the,

3479
02:32:25,620 --> 02:32:28,580
you know,
they're more edgy or whatever.

3480
02:32:28,590 --> 02:32:29,940
You youtube people.
You mean?

3481
02:32:30,210 --> 02:32:34,440
People coming onto the scene,
like the amazing atheist is a fucking

3482
02:32:34,441 --> 02:32:38,970
faggot bitch compared to me.
I fucking tell it like it really is.

3483
02:32:39,070 --> 02:32:41,550
That should be flattering to you that
someone's trying to steal some of your

3484
02:32:41,551 --> 02:32:42,420
thunder.
It is.

3485
02:32:42,480 --> 02:32:45,060
And it's also very flattering that they
never seem to succeed.

3486
02:32:45,840 --> 02:32:47,340
Well,
we got to meet a couple that have

3487
02:32:47,341 --> 02:32:48,210
succeeded.
No,

3488
02:32:48,810 --> 02:32:49,740
no,
not that I've seen.

3489
02:32:49,970 --> 02:32:50,870
No.
The people who go,

3490
02:32:51,030 --> 02:32:54,360
the people who would just ignore me and
is trying to establish their own unique

3491
02:32:54,361 --> 02:32:56,580
identity,
they can succeed.

3492
02:32:56,820 --> 02:33:01,050
The people who define themselves as the
antithesis of me never going to succeed.

3493
02:33:01,110 --> 02:33:04,920
Well also define themselves as your
enemy and it's almost like their

3494
02:33:04,921 --> 02:33:07,800
individuality,
their identity is based on being an

3495
02:33:07,801 --> 02:33:12,450
enemy with you.
Just making yourself contingent upon me.

3496
02:33:12,451 --> 02:33:13,170
You know,
you're,

3497
02:33:13,170 --> 02:33:16,440
you're done.
Especially if you get mad at them back

3498
02:33:16,650 --> 02:33:17,670
then,
you give them poWer.

3499
02:33:17,840 --> 02:33:20,730
You're their adversary.
there must be important if tHe amazing

3500
02:33:20,731 --> 02:33:24,330
atheist talked about me for seven
minutes and people are very nice.

3501
02:33:24,450 --> 02:33:25,860
Most people,
most people are very nice.

3502
02:33:25,861 --> 02:33:26,371
Like,
I mean,

3503
02:33:26,371 --> 02:33:27,780
um,
most of the messages I get

3504
02:33:27,781 --> 02:33:30,000
overwhelmingly positive.
Most of the tweets I received

3505
02:33:30,001 --> 02:33:32,550
overwhelmingly positive.
Everyone is always cool.

3506
02:33:32,551 --> 02:33:33,600
Everyone's always nice,
you know,

3507
02:33:33,601 --> 02:33:36,360
there's a hater here and there,
but it's never really been that big of a

3508
02:33:36,361 --> 02:33:37,194
deal.

3509
02:33:38,850 --> 02:33:40,650
Sometimes I'll say something to piss
people off,

3510
02:33:40,800 --> 02:33:42,930
you know,
the things that really had been like the

3511
02:33:42,931 --> 02:33:46,050
most offensive though,
are never the things that I planned to

3512
02:33:46,051 --> 02:33:47,460
be the most difficult.
What do you think?

3513
02:33:47,800 --> 02:33:50,430
All the videos you've ever done,
what's like the most defensive point

3514
02:33:50,470 --> 02:33:51,550
I've taken?
Here's the.

3515
02:33:51,990 --> 02:33:55,680
Here's the three things that probably
piss people off the most

3516
02:33:57,450 --> 02:33:58,830
when I did a video.
Well,

3517
02:33:59,340 --> 02:34:02,580
I did a video against ron paul once,
but that was when I was a smaller

3518
02:34:02,581 --> 02:34:06,270
channel that really piss people off.
I did a video against buddhism.

3519
02:34:06,300 --> 02:34:10,070
People really pissed because they.
The strange thing about the boot boot,

3520
02:34:10,100 --> 02:34:11,670
you know,
you would never think that for doing an

3521
02:34:11,671 --> 02:34:14,040
anti buddhist video,
you would get death threats,

3522
02:34:14,180 --> 02:34:17,070
but I did.
People were like,

3523
02:34:17,920 --> 02:34:20,860
you fucking misrepresented the tenants
of buddhism,

3524
02:34:20,890 --> 02:34:22,540
bitch.
Now I'm coming for you.

3525
02:34:22,541 --> 02:34:25,240
It's like,
I think you understand them even less

3526
02:34:25,241 --> 02:34:25,750
than I do.

3527
02:34:25,750 --> 02:34:29,680
Apparently
insulted soccer.

3528
02:34:30,070 --> 02:34:35,070
Even calling it soccer will piss a lot
of football fans off.

3529
02:34:35,140 --> 02:34:36,590
Yeah.
That's the european style.

3530
02:34:36,591 --> 02:34:38,770
If you get an american that gets mad at
you call it soccer.

3531
02:34:38,771 --> 02:34:39,940
He's a cunt.
Yeah.

3532
02:34:40,120 --> 02:34:42,140
Agreed.
But I would,

3533
02:34:42,220 --> 02:34:44,740
I've never lost more subscribers than
when I made a video.

3534
02:34:44,741 --> 02:34:46,660
Again,
soccer when I said soccer is fucking

3535
02:34:46,661 --> 02:34:48,730
stupid.
I must have lost.

3536
02:34:48,731 --> 02:34:50,090
I don't know.
Uh,

3537
02:34:50,170 --> 02:34:51,400
my channel probably had,
I don't know,

3538
02:34:51,401 --> 02:34:53,950
a hundred thousand or 200,000 at the
time and I lost,

3539
02:34:53,951 --> 02:34:56,590
you know,
three or 4,000 people just for not

3540
02:34:56,591 --> 02:34:58,930
liking soccer.
I was really mean about it in all

3541
02:34:58,931 --> 02:34:59,860
fairness.
But I mean,

3542
02:34:59,861 --> 02:35:00,940
come on,
it's fucking soccer.

3543
02:35:01,510 --> 02:35:04,750
But why and others say the same thing
about baseball when I assaulted the

3544
02:35:04,751 --> 02:35:05,830
other kid.
Really?

3545
02:35:05,920 --> 02:35:06,810
Yeah.
They got this.

3546
02:35:07,540 --> 02:35:09,310
They got super pissed.
By the way,

3547
02:35:09,420 --> 02:35:11,890
refresh your memory.
Other kin is when we're talking about

3548
02:35:11,891 --> 02:35:16,891
people that think they're foxes or
computer elves or unicorn or a stapler

3549
02:35:17,410 --> 02:35:18,730
who fucking a golf shoe.

3550
02:35:19,220 --> 02:35:21,890
Fucking golf shoes and golf shoe kid.
Mom.

3551
02:35:21,920 --> 02:35:25,230
The you easily could understand.
Yup.

3552
02:35:25,300 --> 02:35:28,540
There's a lot astral cleats coming out
of my back.

3553
02:35:28,570 --> 02:35:31,840
There's a lot of people out there that
are connected to these small

3554
02:35:31,841 --> 02:35:35,260
organizations they're very passionate
about and they don't like you just

3555
02:35:35,290 --> 02:35:38,170
sitting in your hive throwing up on
youtube and hitting all over.

3556
02:35:38,930 --> 02:35:41,500
The thing I got with,
with the other kid was they said that I

3557
02:35:41,501 --> 02:35:45,790
was a kid.
I was putting minors at risk because

3558
02:35:46,210 --> 02:35:50,320
some of the other canner minors and if I
make fun of them then they're going to

3559
02:35:50,321 --> 02:35:53,950
kill themselves and it's my fault
because I made fun of.

3560
02:35:54,310 --> 02:35:57,010
So basically,
you know the guy who goes around saying,

3561
02:35:57,040 --> 02:35:58,990
I'm a dragon.
He's not the problem.

3562
02:35:58,991 --> 02:35:59,771
The guy that says,
no,

3563
02:35:59,771 --> 02:36:00,940
you're not.
That's,

3564
02:36:01,260 --> 02:36:04,180
that's the issue.
Strange logic.

3565
02:36:04,450 --> 02:36:06,010
I agree.
Well,

3566
02:36:06,760 --> 02:36:10,450
you know,
making fun of something like other kids,

3567
02:36:10,451 --> 02:36:13,510
like someone who believes they're a fox,
a in a,

3568
02:36:13,630 --> 02:36:17,590
in a rational world is a very safe
practice.

3569
02:36:17,710 --> 02:36:20,020
I agree.
And rational world that is like,

3570
02:36:20,110 --> 02:36:22,360
boy,
there's almost no victims there because

3571
02:36:22,361 --> 02:36:25,330
the person who really is a pretending
they're a fox,

3572
02:36:25,331 --> 02:36:27,890
they need to be slapped.
Someone needs to wake up and hey,

3573
02:36:27,940 --> 02:36:29,500
fuck face your,
your,

3574
02:36:29,530 --> 02:36:31,810
your name is mike.
You live in toledo.

3575
02:36:31,811 --> 02:36:33,430
You're not a fox.
You're a guy.

3576
02:36:33,460 --> 02:36:34,660
This is your mom.
Does your dad.

3577
02:36:34,661 --> 02:36:35,980
He goes to school,
you talk to people,

3578
02:36:36,070 --> 02:36:37,610
you drive a fucking car.
You know how to fox.

3579
02:36:37,660 --> 02:36:38,830
I don't know if you agree with me on
this,

3580
02:36:38,831 --> 02:36:42,890
but I mean if,
if mike wants to be a furry and pretend

3581
02:36:42,891 --> 02:36:46,780
these a fox,
he knows it's pretend I'm okay.

3582
02:36:46,810 --> 02:36:49,270
I'm okay with it.
And even if he wants to be a fox for

3583
02:36:49,271 --> 02:36:51,190
short periods of time,
like really

3584
02:36:53,030 --> 02:36:55,660
it doesn't even think he's mike,
mike at all.

3585
02:36:55,661 --> 02:36:57,310
Maybe that's like,
it's cathartic release.

3586
02:36:57,311 --> 02:37:00,820
Like he does get naked and he fucking
runs through the woods on all fours and

3587
02:37:00,821 --> 02:37:05,160
it really does feel like a fox freedom
to have fun.

3588
02:37:05,200 --> 02:37:08,290
Why not turn live dance?
It's 24 slash seven thinking you're a

3589
02:37:08,291 --> 02:37:11,410
fox,
like in the grocery store walking down

3590
02:37:11,411 --> 02:37:13,510
the aisle with your fucking cart or
whatever.

3591
02:37:13,511 --> 02:37:15,260
I'm a fox.
No,

3592
02:37:15,320 --> 02:37:16,153
that's rude.

3593
02:37:16,430 --> 02:37:17,360
That's just.
Well,

3594
02:37:17,361 --> 02:37:19,340
you know what it is,
is a dummy in.

3595
02:37:19,450 --> 02:37:20,590
There's plenty of dummies,
you know,

3596
02:37:20,591 --> 02:37:23,580
you find other things to do just.
But anyway,

3597
02:37:23,590 --> 02:37:26,710
I had away from that guy chairman to
leave them alone though because uh,

3598
02:37:26,760 --> 02:37:28,430
there are a little bit too extreme for
me.

3599
02:37:28,980 --> 02:37:33,440
They're upset because again,
being this other kin as we discussed

3600
02:37:33,441 --> 02:37:34,880
before,
is this tiny,

3601
02:37:34,910 --> 02:37:37,550
minor personal victory.
If they can say,

3602
02:37:37,551 --> 02:37:39,200
I'm a fox,
I am fox kin,

3603
02:37:39,350 --> 02:37:43,660
like now if you agree to it,
now all of a sudden they've gained some

3604
02:37:43,661 --> 02:37:45,310
traction.
They've got some motion going on.

3605
02:37:45,340 --> 02:37:48,020
It's otherwise dismal life.
That's real.

3606
02:37:48,021 --> 02:37:50,630
It's like it hurts to suck,
you know,

3607
02:37:51,590 --> 02:37:56,590
to be stuck in some horrible existence
where the thing that gives you the most

3608
02:37:56,661 --> 02:37:58,940
joy is pretending you're a chipmunk.
Like,

3609
02:37:58,941 --> 02:38:00,430
but,
but pretending you're chipmunk,

3610
02:38:00,470 --> 02:38:04,490
ken and that you'd meet up with other
chipmunk king online and like how often

3611
02:38:04,491 --> 02:38:07,670
do you guys eat acorns and you get
together and you fucking sit on your

3612
02:38:07,671 --> 02:38:11,930
knees and the park and you pretend to be
a chipmunk and you enjoy the shit out of

3613
02:38:11,931 --> 02:38:12,230
it.

3614
02:38:12,230 --> 02:38:14,180
Why?
Why is it okay to golf?

3615
02:38:14,210 --> 02:38:17,090
But that's not okay.
Golfing is way fucking dumber than

3616
02:38:17,091 --> 02:38:19,100
pretending to be a chipmunk.
While we agree on that,

3617
02:38:21,980 --> 02:38:23,900
if you,
if you're playing pretend to be a

3618
02:38:23,901 --> 02:38:27,150
chipmunk,
you like trying to commensurate based.

3619
02:38:27,230 --> 02:38:30,080
I can see why.
Pretending to be a chipmunk will be fun.

3620
02:38:30,081 --> 02:38:33,020
You get to like,
golf is fun.

3621
02:38:33,021 --> 02:38:35,610
Golf is just like,
you don't.

3622
02:38:35,670 --> 02:38:38,360
I really don't get fucking guys are
bringing their wives out golfing.

3623
02:38:38,410 --> 02:38:40,520
Like what?
What's going on here?

3624
02:38:40,640 --> 02:38:43,700
Like I have a friend of mine,
he told me that he'll go golfing with

3625
02:38:43,701 --> 02:38:46,460
his buddy and his buddy won't say that
he's going to bring his wife and then

3626
02:38:46,461 --> 02:38:50,090
just brings his wife and he's like,
what in the fuck I thought were going to

3627
02:38:50,091 --> 02:38:52,370
tell dirty jokes.
I'm gonna talk shit about this girl I

3628
02:38:52,371 --> 02:38:54,140
work with and we're going to have some
fun.

3629
02:38:54,140 --> 02:38:57,140
You fucking asshole.
And now we're putting the ball round

3630
02:38:57,141 --> 02:39:01,070
with your mom because she corrects you
every fucking time you say something and

3631
02:39:01,071 --> 02:39:03,830
she's mad at you when you don't
compliment her on her stupid fucking

3632
02:39:03,831 --> 02:39:05,240
golf game.
Oh man.

3633
02:39:06,470 --> 02:39:08,690
What the fuck?
Those guys are the worst dudes.

3634
02:39:08,691 --> 02:39:12,410
You bring their girlfriend everywhere.
I think the most brutal one of the most

3635
02:39:12,411 --> 02:39:13,244
brutal.
Right?

3636
02:39:13,490 --> 02:39:14,960
You know,
I don't know.

3637
02:39:15,900 --> 02:39:18,140
Some of the most part don't ever hang
out with other men,

3638
02:39:18,141 --> 02:39:19,730
so I don't really know at all.
No,

3639
02:39:19,731 --> 02:39:20,660
not really.
Whoa,

3640
02:39:20,661 --> 02:39:21,920
what's going on there?
I don't know.

3641
02:39:22,550 --> 02:39:23,061
I don't really.
I'm.

3642
02:39:23,061 --> 02:39:24,940
I mean I'm very solitary in general,
so.

3643
02:39:26,180 --> 02:39:27,940
So when you go out and you just hang out
with me,

3644
02:39:27,960 --> 02:39:30,950
I guess I just disagree because I don't
really have.

3645
02:39:31,190 --> 02:39:31,851
I mean,
let me see.

3646
02:39:31,851 --> 02:39:33,950
How many friends do I have?
I have always had with golfing.

3647
02:39:34,040 --> 02:39:35,390
Ben,
scotty,

3648
02:39:36,140 --> 02:39:38,750
chelsea.
That's pretty much my three friends.

3649
02:39:39,350 --> 02:39:41,030
Those are dudes.
Yeah.

3650
02:39:41,430 --> 02:39:44,060
Is it a handler?
Chelsea handler and hanging out with

3651
02:39:44,061 --> 02:39:45,980
her?
Chelsea is my girlfriend.

3652
02:39:46,640 --> 02:39:49,190
Oh yeah.
And yeah,

3653
02:39:49,191 --> 02:39:50,024
I mean uh,
you know,

3654
02:39:50,090 --> 02:39:52,190
I had a broader here if I could bring
her to la.

3655
02:39:52,191 --> 02:39:54,620
So I guess I am one of those dudes that
just would bring her everywhere,

3656
02:39:54,670 --> 02:39:58,580
but there's no but I can't see.
I can't see her ever being like I was

3657
02:39:58,581 --> 02:40:01,550
offended by the us or some shit.
Like yeah,

3658
02:40:01,551 --> 02:40:03,470
it's all dependent upon whether or not
your chickens cool.

3659
02:40:03,490 --> 02:40:05,300
Like,
like I have friends who bring their girl

3660
02:40:05,301 --> 02:40:07,100
everywhere and it's awesome because
she's fun to hang with.

3661
02:40:07,250 --> 02:40:09,670
It's when they bring their mom out,
I mean their girlfriends,

3662
02:40:09,671 --> 02:40:11,630
like their mom.
There are dudes that have that sort of

3663
02:40:11,631 --> 02:40:14,400
weird situation where a sorta tells them
what to do.

3664
02:40:14,640 --> 02:40:16,350
Fuck that.
That becomes an issue.

3665
02:40:16,380 --> 02:40:18,900
But I guess girls have the same thing to
imagine being a check.

3666
02:40:19,050 --> 02:40:23,500
You want to have some cool fucking thing
and this dummy brings her husband and I

3667
02:40:23,890 --> 02:40:27,240
know is your party.
I can't imagine myself being fun to

3668
02:40:27,241 --> 02:40:30,520
bring places because all I,
all I do is just bitched and complained

3669
02:40:30,580 --> 02:40:31,413
yet.
But it's entertaining.

3670
02:40:31,460 --> 02:40:32,820
That's what you do.
It's fun.

3671
02:40:33,660 --> 02:40:36,120
It's fun for me.
But I could see how someone else would

3672
02:40:36,121 --> 02:40:37,410
just be like,
oh my god,

3673
02:40:37,411 --> 02:40:38,970
you just second out of the fun out of
things.

3674
02:40:38,971 --> 02:40:41,490
It's like there's no fun to be had here
and that's what I'm pointing out.

3675
02:40:41,580 --> 02:40:42,990
Fuck them.
Yeah,

3676
02:40:43,200 --> 02:40:45,330
fine.
Other people that enjoy it and you have

3677
02:40:45,331 --> 02:40:47,700
a nice whole conversation.
Like if you and me we're at a party and

3678
02:40:47,701 --> 02:40:49,560
we met,
we started talking about shit.

3679
02:40:49,590 --> 02:40:52,680
We would have probably the same
conversation whether or not there was a

3680
02:40:52,710 --> 02:40:54,090
recording of us at all.

3681
02:40:55,260 --> 02:40:56,093
Right?
Yeah,

3682
02:40:56,130 --> 02:40:58,110
true.
That's what I'm saying,

3683
02:40:58,111 --> 02:40:59,120
man.
It's all good.

3684
02:40:59,130 --> 02:41:00,660
Fuck those other people.
Fuck them all.

3685
02:41:00,690 --> 02:41:01,670
Fuck them all.
Do.

3686
02:41:02,140 --> 02:41:07,140
You're the amazing atheist trying to get
away from that name that I know cause

3687
02:41:07,411 --> 02:41:09,330
you know,
it's not because a,

3688
02:41:09,360 --> 02:41:11,670
it's not because I mean like I'm not an
atheist anymore.

3689
02:41:11,671 --> 02:41:13,740
It's just like,
I don't fucking know what else to say.

3690
02:41:13,860 --> 02:41:16,260
Right.
But you're kind of tied into that name,

3691
02:41:16,350 --> 02:41:17,190
right?
Yeah.

3692
02:41:17,310 --> 02:41:20,190
So I'm kind of trying to phase it out.
How do you do that?

3693
02:41:20,280 --> 02:41:21,960
I don't know.
You're going to be like p diddy.

3694
02:41:22,200 --> 02:41:23,670
He used to be puff daddy.
No,

3695
02:41:23,680 --> 02:41:25,470
and then he'd hit a jarring.
You know,

3696
02:41:25,471 --> 02:41:27,210
people you should do that.
Like people don't like that,

3697
02:41:27,211 --> 02:41:28,950
you know,
when you just suddenly changed.

3698
02:41:28,980 --> 02:41:33,980
I just figure I'll use tj and amazing
atheist interchangeably long enough that

3699
02:41:34,051 --> 02:41:35,820
eventually,
you know,

3700
02:41:35,821 --> 02:41:36,510
they won't notice.

3701
02:41:36,510 --> 02:41:38,970
I'm not using the amazing agency.
Maybe you should have two different

3702
02:41:38,971 --> 02:41:40,920
outfits,
like one you should wear,

3703
02:41:40,921 --> 02:41:44,190
like maybe some sort of spandex yoga
type outfit,

3704
02:41:44,191 --> 02:41:47,640
like a superhero would with a they want
to see my physique,

3705
02:41:47,670 --> 02:41:50,430
but I do just for the sake of this
character,

3706
02:41:50,431 --> 02:41:53,670
like you have two a's,
like an a amazing atheist and it's like

3707
02:41:53,671 --> 02:41:58,671
a character that you play and then you
bring in tj and maybe you could have a

3708
02:41:58,681 --> 02:42:01,190
split screen where tj and the amazing
atheist can.

3709
02:42:02,010 --> 02:42:03,990
Can have different points of view.
Oh yeah.

3710
02:42:04,050 --> 02:42:07,550
It would be like two different fucking
versions.

3711
02:42:07,560 --> 02:42:11,470
You remember when garth brooks became
chris gaines do remember that?

3712
02:42:11,471 --> 02:42:12,510
Yeah,
that's what I'm talking about.

3713
02:42:12,511 --> 02:42:16,440
Yeah.
He's like the edgy garth brooks.

3714
02:42:16,490 --> 02:42:17,940
It wasn't even the edgy.
Garth brooks.

3715
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:20,400
He was made a behind the music.
Remember that?

3716
02:42:20,430 --> 02:42:23,310
Edgy.
But it wasn't at garth brooks at all.

3717
02:42:23,310 --> 02:42:24,870
They made a fake pack.
Yeah.

3718
02:42:25,140 --> 02:42:28,200
Well they made a hole behind them that
and like wearing mascara.

3719
02:42:28,210 --> 02:42:30,750
Yeah.
Well you had a crazy wig and background

3720
02:42:30,751 --> 02:42:33,870
and drug problems you've got away from.
And I was a tortured artist and he's

3721
02:42:34,540 --> 02:42:35,880
like,
you're a garth brooks.

3722
02:42:35,881 --> 02:42:37,230
You fuck,
we know who you are.

3723
02:42:37,320 --> 02:42:39,240
Like what do you two have pretended to
be this new guy?

3724
02:42:39,390 --> 02:42:40,920
Why are you wearing a wig?
Garth?

3725
02:42:41,190 --> 02:42:43,350
What do you do it?
I thought you got friends in low places

3726
02:42:43,351 --> 02:42:45,000
with all this bullshit.
What's this?

3727
02:42:45,001 --> 02:42:46,890
Moody fucking smashing pumpkins.
Shit.

3728
02:42:46,920 --> 02:42:47,753
You know,
if,

3729
02:42:47,870 --> 02:42:50,250
if I was a.
I don't know if you show me a picture of

3730
02:42:50,251 --> 02:42:52,200
garth brooks in a wig and said,
who is this?

3731
02:42:52,201 --> 02:42:54,000
I don't think I would be like garth
brooks.

3732
02:42:54,001 --> 02:42:54,834
You not?
No.

3733
02:42:55,110 --> 02:42:57,030
You didn't know about chris gaines.
I'm looking up more.

3734
02:42:57,180 --> 02:42:58,560
Apparently he was australian.

3735
02:42:59,210 --> 02:43:00,750
Oh,
chris gaines is Australia.

3736
02:43:01,360 --> 02:43:03,990
He had a whole different country.
You came from god damn.

3737
02:43:03,991 --> 02:43:06,780
Anti american son of a bitch.
I thought he was all about country

3738
02:43:06,781 --> 02:43:11,010
music.
I got friends in low places on man.

3739
02:43:11,200 --> 02:43:12,670
I just had to listen.
That shit on the bus

3740
02:43:15,120 --> 02:43:20,050
was like fucking trent reznor.
Trent reznor fuck prints.

3741
02:43:20,110 --> 02:43:23,440
That's what you see in right there.
That is so hilarious.

3742
02:43:23,950 --> 02:43:25,930
What was he?
What kind of drugs was he on?

3743
02:43:26,050 --> 02:43:27,490
I'll tell you what.
He was on fame.

3744
02:43:27,570 --> 02:43:31,240
G-force.
THat's what happened to garth brooks.

3745
02:43:31,241 --> 02:43:34,690
The same shit that happened to elvis and
fucking everybody else,

3746
02:43:34,691 --> 02:43:35,920
man,
donny and marie,

3747
02:43:36,070 --> 02:43:38,420
all of them
all.

3748
02:43:41,850 --> 02:43:44,560
I don't know what to say.
You don't have to man.

3749
02:43:44,590 --> 02:43:45,520
You don't have to know.
We just,

3750
02:43:45,521 --> 02:43:46,380
we're here.
We're,

3751
02:43:46,381 --> 02:43:47,740
we're experiencing.
We're existing.

3752
02:43:47,770 --> 02:43:49,740
We're basically out of time though.
So,

3753
02:43:49,741 --> 02:43:51,730
um,
I want to thank you for doing this and

3754
02:43:51,731 --> 02:43:52,870
give you an open invitation.
Man.

3755
02:43:52,871 --> 02:43:54,280
I enjoyed talking to you.
So thank you.

3756
02:43:54,370 --> 02:43:57,430
You want to come back?
Get your fucking lazy ass out of bed on

3757
02:43:57,431 --> 02:43:58,660
time.
Make it to the airport.

3758
02:43:58,661 --> 02:44:00,880
Don't shake your head.
You can do is I surround myself with

3759
02:44:00,881 --> 02:44:05,770
responsible people.
There's like a manager type character

3760
02:44:05,800 --> 02:44:07,660
who takes you in the road.
You can pretty much.

3761
02:44:07,661 --> 02:44:10,840
That's pretty much scotty though.
You could do these like you could do

3762
02:44:10,841 --> 02:44:13,480
live shows.
You could do this on the road.

3763
02:44:14,250 --> 02:44:16,450
We've been thinking about doing that
with a drunken peasants,

3764
02:44:16,451 --> 02:44:18,880
you know,
while we're here in la,

3765
02:44:18,881 --> 02:44:20,770
we're doing a meet up with our fans.

3766
02:44:20,890 --> 02:44:22,560
Beautiful.
Uh,

3767
02:44:22,720 --> 02:44:26,430
well I don't want to announce it and you
hear a bit because you can fucking have

3768
02:44:26,431 --> 02:44:28,340
either.
We already have so many people rsvp a,

3769
02:44:28,660 --> 02:44:30,250
I guess.
I guess I can say we're going To get the

3770
02:44:30,251 --> 02:44:35,251
v lounge in santa monica on a friday
from five to nine,

3771
02:44:37,631 --> 02:44:41,430
but we already have a shit ton of rsvps
so I don't know how many people flake.

3772
02:44:41,460 --> 02:44:43,400
You're in California.
Maybe flakes.

3773
02:44:43,520 --> 02:44:45,040
So fog.
We're really interested in it.

3774
02:44:45,041 --> 02:44:47,830
They can go but yeah,
we're going to do like a big q and a and

3775
02:44:47,831 --> 02:44:48,640
shit.
But yeah,

3776
02:44:48,640 --> 02:44:51,970

some point,

3778

We're going to,

3779
02:44:55,480 --> 02:44:58,630
we're going to try to figure that out
maybe logistically one of these days,

3780
02:44:59,140 --> 02:45:01,510
but you know,
maybe not quite yet.

3781
02:45:01,870 --> 02:45:02,703

youtube and laugh at their videos and

3784
02:45:08,621 --> 02:45:10,540
