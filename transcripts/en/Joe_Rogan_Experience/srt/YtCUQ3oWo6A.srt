1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,030
Lots of,
lots of challenges growing up and then 

2
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:07,500
all of a sudden when I was actually away
from all of the stuff that else familiar

3
00:00:07,501 --> 00:00:12,501
with people that were familiar with me 
with nice to be able to be in a setting 

4
00:00:12,501 --> 00:00:15,441
where uh,
I was actually excelling and achieving 

5
00:00:15,441 --> 00:00:16,720
things anonymously,
you know,

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:21,770
there was things that were happening 
that all of a sudden I was shining in a 

7
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:23,500
way but not a,
you know,

8
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,700
none of my people back in the where I 
was from knew anything about it.

9
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,320
But I was doing really well.

10
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,350
Discipline and resolve and doing any 
difficult endeavor is so important for a

11
00:00:33,351 --> 00:00:34,430
young man.
You know,

12
00:00:34,431 --> 00:00:39,431
and this is one of the sort of themes 
we've brought up on this podcast many 

13
00:00:39,431 --> 00:00:42,731
times is it,
is there's no coming of age rituals in 

14
00:00:42,731 --> 00:00:46,631
our culture anymore.
And I always thought they were retarded 

15
00:00:46,631 --> 00:00:46,631
when I was young.
Like,

16
00:00:46,631 --> 00:00:50,561
you know,
what are these fucking idiots hanging 

17
00:00:50,561 --> 00:00:50,561
themselves by their tits and you know,
or you know,

18
00:00:50,561 --> 00:00:53,740
putting their hands in the bullet ant 
bins.

19
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:58,750
Like,
what the fuck is wrong with these 

20
00:00:58,750 --> 00:00:58,750
people?
Why would they like,

21
00:00:58,750 --> 00:00:58,750
I'm 18.
I'm a man.

22
00:00:58,750 --> 00:00:58,750
Done.
No,

23
00:00:58,750 --> 00:00:59,240
no,
really.

24
00:00:59,241 --> 00:01:01,550
You really need to go through something.
You need to,

25
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:02,870
you need to,
you know,

26
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:07,990
you need to have.
That's why so many cultures have either 

27
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:11,381
a psychedelic experiences that young 
people go through or what we talked 

28
00:01:11,381 --> 00:01:12,740
about this yesterday or deal poisons 
where it's,

29
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,080
it's not a psychedelic because it's not 
in their area,

30
00:01:15,081 --> 00:01:17,810
so they take something that almost kills
them and then when it's over,

31
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:20,110
they're just so happy to be healthy 
again and alive.

32
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:22,550
And they sort of realized they've gone 
through a tunnel.

33
00:01:22,551 --> 00:01:24,050
They made it through a passage,
they've,

34
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:28,370
they've reached an actual new level and 
we're missing that man.

35
00:01:28,371 --> 00:01:31,310
We get out of fucking high school and 
then we're just lost.

36
00:01:31,311 --> 00:01:34,430
Were panicking completely terrified.
We're going to starve to death.

37
00:01:34,431 --> 00:01:39,431
Is clinging onto the first job or the 
first opportunity for some sort of 

38
00:01:39,431 --> 00:01:40,040
security that we can,
you know,

39
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:45,080
uh,
the only good thing that I could ever 

40
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,711
think about having sort of some sort of 
a mandatory military experience for most

41
00:01:50,391 --> 00:01:53,720
United States citizens is to two fold.
One,

42
00:01:53,721 --> 00:01:58,721
so people could understand what the fuck
the military is really all about and of 

43
00:01:58,721 --> 00:01:58,721
this nonsense,
raw,

44
00:01:58,721 --> 00:02:03,320
raw chicken Hawk bullshit where people 
support this idea of sending our fucking

45
00:02:03,321 --> 00:02:08,321
trained killers to these places where we
don't know anybody and fucking them up 

46
00:02:08,321 --> 00:02:08,990
in the name of justice or whatever the 
fuck it is.

47
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:11,180
We would get a better idea of what that 
is.

48
00:02:11,181 --> 00:02:16,181
No,
it'd be harder to pull the wool over 

49
00:02:16,181 --> 00:02:17,531
people's eyes because it's so easy for 
all these people that will have nothing 

50
00:02:17,531 --> 00:02:20,831
to do with shooting anybody ever to say 
we support the troops and support you 

51
00:02:20,831 --> 00:02:25,461
are heroes and you're the reason why we 
can be free and nonsensical statements 

52
00:02:25,851 --> 00:02:30,851
that mean the reason why that shit flies
is because we got a nice blanket.

53
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:33,830
This blanket of security,
the USA,

54
00:02:33,831 --> 00:02:35,870
whatever the fuck it is,
throw it over your head.

55
00:02:35,871 --> 00:02:37,610
You know,
you don't really have to think about the

56
00:02:37,611 --> 00:02:41,030
actual horrors of military.
If we forced people to join,

57
00:02:41,031 --> 00:02:46,031
and I'm not saying we should,
but that the only benefit that we would 

58
00:02:46,031 --> 00:02:49,391
get out of that as it people would kind 
of get an idea of what reality really 

59
00:02:49,391 --> 00:02:49,391
is.

60
00:02:49,391 --> 00:02:51,170
Yeah,
I think it's a fine line you.

61
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,200
There's no way to really kind of,
to really be able to direct that 

62
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:00,941
experience.
It's really as an individual and an 

63
00:03:00,941 --> 00:03:03,100
individual thing,
there's going to be people that figure 

64
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:03,460
out a way to make that work for them in 
terms of being lazy.

65
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:08,850
Um,
I got out of shape in the army when I 

66
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:11,251
got,
when I went in because back when I sold 

67
00:03:11,251 --> 00:03:11,740
the system,
when they,

68
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,450
when I went in,
they uh,

69
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:18,720
they wanted people in so they weren't 
really pushing people to heart and 

70
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,850
within a period of time when we didn't 
have a lot of obvious conflict going on,

71
00:03:21,851 --> 00:03:26,851
so it seemed like everything was sorted 
itself out and why am I going to the 

72
00:03:26,851 --> 00:03:30,871
military other than just getting a 
college fund out of it and then it's 

73
00:03:30,871 --> 00:03:30,871
fucking off.
Uh,

74
00:03:30,871 --> 00:03:30,880
but,
you know,

75
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:36,420
so they were kind of like kind of 
lowered the standard a little bit to 

76
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,570
kind of get more people in.
I think it was a mistake,

77
00:03:37,571 --> 00:03:39,670
but you know,
I still learned a lot of.

78
00:03:39,671 --> 00:03:42,100
What year was this?
This is from 80 to 85.

79
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:46,170
I came real close to joining an 85 when 
they got into high school,

80
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,090
it was a,
they had an army taekwondo team.

81
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:48,720
They would,
uh,

82
00:03:48,721 --> 00:03:50,670
you would get a Shitty,
easy just job,

83
00:03:50,671 --> 00:03:53,610
but they would pay you to train and they
give you a or they told you,

84
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,430
fighting the train,

85
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:56,520
see what they did.
The Bait and switch with me too,

86
00:03:56,521 --> 00:03:57,000
like,
oh,

87
00:03:57,001 --> 00:03:58,950
you want to be a map maker?
Oh,

88
00:03:58,951 --> 00:04:00,720
that's a great because you're an artist.
Awesome.

89
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,770
Let's bring it on down.
Let's sign up and get you there.

90
00:04:02,771 --> 00:04:07,771
And then like you get on the bus and you
drive all the way to Detroit and they 

91
00:04:07,771 --> 00:04:07,771
get you there and they go,
oh yeah,

92
00:04:07,771 --> 00:04:09,960
that one's full.
That's the full.

93
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,560
But you know what you can do,
you can run out and catch bullets.

94
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,870
Yeah,
I had a fucked a do that,

95
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:24,370
competed on the national team,
this guy bobby cleat,

96
00:04:24,371 --> 00:04:29,371
and it was out of the US army team.
He was the one who was getting me to 

97
00:04:29,371 --> 00:04:32,610
think about doing it.
He always freaked me out because he was 

98
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:34,630
really religious and when I was 18 I was
such a,

99
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:38,770
a godless loser that I really.
Religious people scared me.

100
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:44,070
Like I was.
The one thing I was scared of competing 

101
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:44,070
against was religious people.
Like when I was,

102
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:48,660
I wasn't scared of black people at first
until I beat my first black guy and then

103
00:04:48,971 --> 00:04:53,971
it was a,
it was religious people because I would 

104
00:04:53,971 --> 00:04:54,310
see them sitting down like reading the 
Bible before they'd fight and I'm like,

105
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:58,180
motherfucker,
students get godness side.

106
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,240
Like he's Kinda gotten us.
I don't even fucking know what's in the 

107
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:03,240
Bible all.
I went to Catholic school for one year.

108
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,260
All I could think of was this fucking 
guy's gonna have Jesus on his side.

109
00:05:05,261 --> 00:05:08,350
He's gonna kick my ass.
But this Bobby Clayton Guy,

110
00:05:08,351 --> 00:05:10,100
every time he would fight,
he would,

111
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:15,150
he would sit down and read the Bible 
before we would go out there and he was 

112
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:15,430
on the U.
S army team came real close to fall.

113
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:18,940
That dude's footsteps.
He was a couple of steps ahead of me and

114
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:21,820
the tournament scene and I was looked up
to him.

115
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:22,600
So I was like,
wow,

116
00:05:22,601 --> 00:05:24,250
maybe that's the move,
maybe the army.

117
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:26,910
And I looked back on it now and that,
that,

118
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:30,550
that weird feeling of indecision than I 
had when I got out of high school.

119
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,830
It makes me so sympathetic,
you know?

120
00:05:32,831 --> 00:05:37,831
And that's why whenever anybody tries to
criticize the actual people that are 

121
00:05:38,261 --> 00:05:39,580
over there,
the actual troops,

122
00:05:39,581 --> 00:05:40,030
I'm like,
man,

123
00:05:40,031 --> 00:05:41,130
that is crazy.
You know?

124
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,910
Well they're there.
They're the one that is actually pulling

125
00:05:42,911 --> 00:05:44,060
the trigger.
Then the one like,

126
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:49,080
man,
you don't even know what kind of 

127
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:49,080
momentum is behind being a part of a 
machine like that.

128
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,240
And being a 20 year old man or an 18 
year old man and you know,

129
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:56,800
and wanting to respect and admiration of
your peers and you're fucking,

130
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,410
your ceo is telling you whatever the guy
is,

131
00:06:00,411 --> 00:06:05,411
the head guy is telling you that they'll
give you an extra leave if you kill a 

132
00:06:05,411 --> 00:06:05,720
guy with a knife.
And have you ever seen those guys?

133
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:08,720
The describing this,
there was a video,

134
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,310
I don't want anybody to look at it right
now,

135
00:06:10,311 --> 00:06:14,960
but there's a video called American 
soldier throws away his metals.

136
00:06:14,961 --> 00:06:16,230
It's one of those,
um,

137
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:22,270
Iraq veterans against the war videos 
where this guy talks extremely candidly 

138
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,970
about his time in Iraq and killing 
civilians.

139
00:06:25,971 --> 00:06:28,850
And I mean,
it's intense shit because,

140
00:06:28,851 --> 00:06:30,500
you know,
this guy's not proud of this.

141
00:06:30,501 --> 00:06:34,670
And he's swallowing his words and he's 
talking incredibly honestly,

142
00:06:34,671 --> 00:06:38,120
but it's fucking his chief officer,
whoever the fuck it was,

143
00:06:38,121 --> 00:06:40,040
the head guy told them they'd given four
days leave.

144
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:43,700
They killed a guy with a knife.
So they had an extra incentive to kill a

145
00:06:43,701 --> 00:06:44,540
guy with a knife.
And you're like,

146
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:46,550
wow,
America,

147
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,410
fuck yeah.
Fuck yeah,

148
00:06:48,411 --> 00:06:49,390
freedom.
Yeah,

149
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:51,810
it's a,
it's a,

150
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:53,580
it's a,
I think,

151
00:06:53,581 --> 00:06:55,320
you know,
everybody in some way I think,

152
00:06:55,321 --> 00:06:58,530
I think you're right about trying to 
figure out a way that have some,

153
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,730
some more perspective on,
you know,

154
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:07,130
just putting the situation,
putting people in this situation where 

155
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:09,891
they have to kind of go through that for
themselves and kind of discover your 

156
00:07:09,891 --> 00:07:13,320
inner warrior in Michigan.
That kind of becoming a person.

157
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:17,220
I'm a male or female,
just trying to figure out what that next

158
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:22,940
step for you is separating from the nest
and becoming your own person and you 

159
00:07:23,281 --> 00:07:25,360
know,
to uh,

160
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,510
we can,
we can talk around it all you want,

161
00:07:27,511 --> 00:07:30,780
but at the end of the day there are 
monsters in the world.

162
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,270
Um,
most of them are us in,

163
00:07:33,271 --> 00:07:33,930
you know,
that's,

164
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:34,740
that's what comes in,
you know,

165
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,260
we are,
we have the capacity for amazing,

166
00:07:37,261 --> 00:07:38,040
wonderful things.

167
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,650
We have the capacity for some 
horrendous,

168
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:45,710
awful things as well.
And I think part of that having that 

169
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:50,570
warrior awakened in you is,
is more about understanding the monster 

170
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:57,831
in you and understanding how to keep 
that at bay and understand how to keep 

171
00:07:57,831 --> 00:07:58,530
that in check so that,
you know,

172
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:02,460
making it a global,
global perspective.

173
00:08:02,461 --> 00:08:05,480
And I am in no way am I a hippie or you 
know,

174
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,360
I'm delusional about like,
we're not just going to have world peace

175
00:08:09,361 --> 00:08:10,850
someday.
It's not,

176
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,030
it's just not the case.
You know,

177
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:17,031
you hit the,
we're going to be struggling with our 

178
00:08:17,031 --> 00:08:17,031
inner monster forever.
And some,

179
00:08:17,031 --> 00:08:21,020
you know,
there are monsters that are just out 

180
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,400
more in areas.
And the reality is we have to keep that 

181
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:23,610
in check.

182
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:29,080
Well,
we lack any sort of a logical use guide 

183
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,900
for being a human.
You know,

184
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:35,980
we,
we're essentially go on the experiences 

185
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,040
of people before us and occasionally we 
get wisdom.

186
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:41,450
Like that poem that you read or that a 
excerpt that you read,

187
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:45,410
which is genius and brilliant from a man
who lived 200 years ago.

188
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:46,890
Yeah.
But you know,

189
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:51,230
more than likely you get a fucking Moron
for a dad who pump bullshit in your head

190
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:53,480
until you're 18.
Then you leave and you're like,

191
00:08:53,481 --> 00:08:58,440
these fucking niggers are trying to take
jobs and like fucking kid.

192
00:08:58,441 --> 00:09:00,390
He's in.
Here's a shovel.

193
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:01,620
The job for you.
Oh,

194
00:09:01,621 --> 00:09:03,570
you're quitting.
There you go.

195
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,520
It's,
it's,

196
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:09,970
it's a,
it's a weird thing I've tried to hire 

197
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:12,501
your nephew is they keep morons,
are allowed to raise more and you're 

198
00:09:12,961 --> 00:09:16,860
allowed to homeschool them to you.
Allow it to sit them down and teach them

199
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:22,220
the same idiotic nonsense that you 
learned and keep the same pattern of 

200
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,460
fear and ignorance going.

201
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,560
It's,
it's very strange.

202
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:27,750
It's very.
And there's no way to cure that either.

203
00:09:27,751 --> 00:09:32,751
I mean,
who is any man to tell any other man in 

204
00:09:32,751 --> 00:09:35,590
until we have some really incredibly 
sophisticated ways of measuring 

205
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:37,180
convenance that are just rock solid.
And uh,

206
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:37,700
you know,
like,

207
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:41,370
like a litmus liquor.
I'd used to do a joke in my act about if

208
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:46,630
you could find out if you were an idiot,
as easy as he could find out if you're 

209
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:49,491
pregnant,
you just go and lick something and look 

210
00:09:49,491 --> 00:09:49,491
at and go,
I'm a fucking idiot.

211
00:09:49,491 --> 00:09:50,190
There's no way this is broken.
You throw it away.

212
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:53,790
There'd be a pile of idiot detectors up 
to the fucking moon and you'd be like,

213
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:58,850
bullshit.
Fucking throw it down and grab another 

214
00:09:58,850 --> 00:09:59,550
one until that happens.
How do you say a man can't have a baby?

215
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,960
How do you make,
say a guy,

216
00:10:00,961 --> 00:10:01,700
you know,
uh,

217
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,480
can't raise a family and teach it.

218
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,430
It's on his own values.
He can't.

219
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:08,280
I think there's not going to want to get
all 1984.

220
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:11,280
But I think in terms of like say for 
example,

221
00:10:11,281 --> 00:10:13,380
health benefits,
if the,

222
00:10:13,381 --> 00:10:14,870
if you go in to get some kind of,
you know,

223
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,480
something for your cold or your,
you know,

224
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,280
you're just basically sick now you know,
your,

225
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:21,150
your,
your arm chopped off.

226
00:10:21,151 --> 00:10:21,720
Okay.
That's,

227
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:24,720
we understand that.
But as far as just general health,

228
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:30,350
if uh,
if for some reason you go in for that 

229
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:30,440
kind of general health stuff and they 
just,

230
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:35,540
I think they should be able to run your 
credit card statement to see if you'd 

231
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:35,540
been to Mcdonald's lately.
You've been at Mcdonald's,

232
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:39,360
you know,
drinking coca cola or eating the candies

233
00:10:39,361 --> 00:10:40,610
are hitting,
hitting the,

234
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,940
hitting the fast food.
It's like,

235
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:42,560
no,
no,

236
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:45,900
you don't get anything.
I've had this idea for a long times that

237
00:10:45,901 --> 00:10:49,680
the way to strengthen America is really 
to make less losers.

238
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,500
So anytime there's any sort of a 
situation like that,

239
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:57,720
there should be some resources dedicated
to pulling people out of that in a,

240
00:10:57,721 --> 00:10:59,730
in a,
in a really enthusiastic way.

241
00:10:59,731 --> 00:11:04,110
The same way this research is dedicated 
to rebuilding Iraq after we blow it up.

242
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:09,140
I mean there should be a way to like let
people know the infrastructure of 

243
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:12,030
America needs to be rebuilt to that 
infrastructure of humanity.

244
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,940
The infrastructure in the age of 
information with all the,

245
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,810
all the stuff that we know about what 
it,

246
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:22,880
what,
what's important about being a human 

247
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,101
being.
We shouldn't invest some resources into 

248
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,351
that and developing human beings in that
way and if you're going to provide them 

249
00:11:27,351 --> 00:11:30,781
with free healthcare,
should also provide them with some sort 

250
00:11:30,781 --> 00:11:33,201
of an education and some sort of a,
some actually acceptable form where 

251
00:11:34,141 --> 00:11:39,141
they're going to really absorb it of the
fuck you're doing to your body stupid 

252
00:11:39,141 --> 00:11:39,600
and taxpayers shouldn't be paying for 
this.

253
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:44,720
And you know,
we might have to put you in a state 

254
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,780
where everybody eats big macs for magic 
force you into some place.

255
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:46,410
You know,
you're gonna,

256
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:48,930
you're gonna have to move to South 
Dakota because that's the big Mac state.

257
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,500
You want to keep eating big macs.
All right,

258
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,290
well you can still be on the government 
nipple.

259
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:54,020
I was writing a at one point,
but

260
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:59,090
that was kind of like that where it was 
some detective and he starts realizing 

261
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:00,850
that there's some people just keep 
disappearing and you know,

262
00:12:00,851 --> 00:12:05,851
it's kind of a missing persons case and 
that kind of turns into like a lot of 

263
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:06,190
missing people.
And he started kind of looking over,

264
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,510
you know,
kind of put the board up.

265
00:12:07,511 --> 00:12:10,600
They got their faces up there and 
realize all these people that are really

266
00:12:10,601 --> 00:12:14,800
large and then all sudden it turned into
this total saifai thing where it's like,

267
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:17,530
actually the aliens have like kind of 
infiltrated the government.

268
00:12:17,531 --> 00:12:19,660
They've like engineered this and hear 
this.

269
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:23,710
The corn products saw the syrup and 
they're basically like,

270
00:12:23,711 --> 00:12:24,580
the government's like,
yeah,

271
00:12:24,581 --> 00:12:25,150
for,
you know,

272
00:12:25,151 --> 00:12:30,151
for whatever technology will will take 
this and we'll feed our people this and 

273
00:12:30,151 --> 00:12:32,380
the aliens are harvesting the fat people
put in their rocket ships to

274
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:38,860
tailor our,
their rocket ships like whale oil or 

275
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:41,560
fossil fuels.
Like we'll just kind of harvesting why 

276
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:41,560
not orange people?
We had this,

277
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,190
uh,
I said Rob Wolf yesterday,

278
00:12:43,191 --> 00:12:45,230
the author,
author of the Paleo Solution,

279
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,340
brilliant,
brilliant guy,

280
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:51,610
but what he was talking about government
subsidies and corn and the reason why 

281
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:53,000
there's so much corn out there and corn 
syrup and it's used in so many different

282
00:12:53,001 --> 00:12:54,920
things and it's so terrible for you.
And it's like.

283
00:12:54,921 --> 00:12:57,220
And it's not even economically feasible.
He's like,

284
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:00,350
the government is actually paying these 
people to grow this shit because there's

285
00:13:00,351 --> 00:13:02,960
not a lot of profit.
And growing it like somehow or another,

286
00:13:02,961 --> 00:13:07,961
some hustle has bitten,
been put into place and the direct 

287
00:13:07,961 --> 00:13:10,010
result of it is a billion fat fucks and 
its harvest.

288
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,830
It's amazing they're coming,
they're going to suck us up,

289
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,240
they're going to put us in a fucking 
engine.

290
00:13:14,241 --> 00:13:15,020
You know,
the twist would be,

291
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:20,460
you know,
like all of a sudden there's a very 

292
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:20,460
large family and they're not being 
harvested like what's going on?

293
00:13:20,461 --> 00:13:21,130
It's like,
well it's just,

294
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:22,860
they're genetically.
That's their,

295
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,830
that's their genetics they had,
they,

296
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,710
they haven't been fed the corn syrup,
so they're,

297
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,580
they're just being passed over.
So it has nothing to do with actual,

298
00:13:30,581 --> 00:13:35,581
like large people.
It has to do with people that are 

299
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:36,240
specifically like gorging on the corn 
syrup.

300
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,630
Well,
if we really do encounter alien life and

301
00:13:39,631 --> 00:13:42,750
that alien life actually eats biological
matter,

302
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,450
we're going to be fucked just the same 
way.

303
00:13:45,451 --> 00:13:47,250
Pigs are fucked.
The same.

304
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:52,430
Pigs are fucking smart man.
I stopped eating pork for a couple of 

305
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:54,510
months once a couple of years.
Actually,

306
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,120
like a nightmare.
It was pretty rough time.

307
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:00,290
I saw my brother's keeper talk to you 
anymore.

308
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:02,040
I know.
Talk to you anymore.

309
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:04,200
Have you ever seen the documentary?
My brother's keeper.

310
00:14:04,201 --> 00:14:07,020
It's about these slow.
They were slow.

311
00:14:07,021 --> 00:14:11,340
They had some sort of a mental 
retardation and they ran a farm and I'm.

312
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:16,550
One of them was accused of a murder or 
something heinous and probably most 

313
00:14:16,561 --> 00:14:18,510
likely been pinned on them because they 
were slow.

314
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,460
Well,
these guys running the farm,

315
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:23,320
they went to kill a pig when they pulled
out the shotgun,

316
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:29,100
the shotgun and the pig is fucking 
running left and right.

317
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:34,670
Trying to get away from this guy.
It recognizing the gun and freaks out 

318
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:35,470
and filing.
He gets out and shoots and I'm.

319
00:14:35,471 --> 00:14:36,660
I remember thinking,
man,

320
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:41,690
pinks are fucking so I can't be in pigs 
because you could shoot a cow in front 

321
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:43,410
of another cow and then the other cows 
barely react and be like,

322
00:14:43,411 --> 00:14:44,190
look,
I don't,

323
00:14:44,191 --> 00:14:45,620
I don't have a problem with that,
but I'm like,

324
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:50,630
shooting that pig is kind of fucked.
The aliens are going to treat us just 

325
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:51,320
like all due.
Respect my,

326
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:52,450
my boat.

327
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:53,840
You know my,
my pig brother,

328
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:58,970
Bacon dude.
Apparently the slow cooking method,

329
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
robb wolf was explaining is the shit 
you're supposed to put a grill electric 

330
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,770
grill on 200 and cooker for two hours 
and the Bacon becomes insane.

331
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,930
Yes.
I'm not ready to commit to that.

332
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:11,600
The crispy sounds great.
I feel like an asshole.

333
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,690
Like he said,
it'd be like an incense.

334
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,720
Almost.
Your whole house would smell like bacon 

335
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:19,720
for two hours while it cooks.
Yeah.

336
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,170
That's a good way to become a fat fuck 
twitching,

337
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:24,320
but if there are aliens and they are a 
million years more advanced than us,

338
00:15:24,321 --> 00:15:29,120
they're going to eat the shit out of our
folk law for the stuffing ourselves with

339
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:32,710
all this fast food and car and it's 
we're grain fed cattle.

340
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:36,140
Cattle aren't supposed to eat grain near
neither people and those are.

341
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,060
That's what they had.
They finished them on that shit.

342
00:15:38,061 --> 00:15:41,530
That's all nice and fat and juicy 
furniture finish him.

343
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:44,120
Are you still working on a perfect 
circle at all?

344
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:49,130
Are we ever going to see another album?
Because I know for a while you were 

345
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:50,630
working on something and then it kind of
dissolved into.

346
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,240
I don't know even know what happened,
but um,

347
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,130
but you never know.
There's always,

348
00:15:55,280 --> 00:16:00,280
there's always possibilities.
My ex girlfriend had a perfect circle 

349
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:03,671
tattoo and I always had to look at it 
every time it was right on her butt.

350
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:06,560
So every time I,
I'm not very comfortable.

351
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,060
So let's go back to when the power went 
out,

352
00:16:11,061 --> 00:16:12,410
man.
We were talking about Hicks.

353
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,370
You guys put Hicks on,
uh,

354
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:18,530
you thanked him on a cd because you got 
ahold of one of his,

355
00:16:18,531 --> 00:16:20,720
uh,
cassettes and you enjoyed it and,

356
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,820
but you never,
you guys never actually toured together.

357
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:23,640
But you know,
we closed,

358
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:25,670
we planned on it.
It was basically a plan.

359
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,540
We were kind of setting into motion in 
like mid 93,

360
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:32,510
uh,
talking and that's when it's time when,

361
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,790
when he came down and it was kind of 
part of why he was coming down.

362
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:36,080
We're trying to figure out what we're 
going to do.

363
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,350
Comedians and rock musicians like that.
It's a,

364
00:16:39,351 --> 00:16:44,351
it's a weird combination of bobcat.
Goldthwait did a lot of work with 

365
00:16:44,351 --> 00:16:45,230
Nirvana.
He opened up for them.

366
00:16:45,231 --> 00:16:50,231
We come in here and he told some 
hilarious stories about them just 

367
00:16:50,231 --> 00:16:52,850
fucking and shit at him screaming at him
and fucking murder in their eyes.

368
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,660
Fucking state.
He's friends with them and they want him

369
00:16:56,661 --> 00:16:58,400
to go out there.
It's like,

370
00:16:58,401 --> 00:16:58,960
yeah,
like I,

371
00:16:59,020 --> 00:16:59,980
I actually approached,
uh,

372
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:01,550
David Cross a couple of years ago,
hey man,

373
00:17:01,551 --> 00:17:02,400
we're going to do another.
You.

374
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:05,300
No,
I would say no to.

375
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:06,500
No,
I wouldn't want to.

376
00:17:06,501 --> 00:17:08,240
Yeah.
You don't want to eat dick in front of a

377
00:17:08,241 --> 00:17:10,560
rock crowd.
Right?

378
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:13,910
To with coins and stuff.
It was all weird combination.

379
00:17:13,911 --> 00:17:16,690
It's like you're not providing them what
they're there to see you.

380
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:18,800
You've got to train me.
Might work.

381
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:21,820
I've seen guys do it and pull it off.
And it works with.

382
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:23,250
It works with pulsifer.
Yeah,

383
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:28,460
because it's just,
it's just that the nature of that 

384
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:28,460
project,
because it's,

385
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:29,170
it's just that there's just all this 
different stuff going on.

386
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:32,600
You've got film and you've got your 
video and you've got animation,

387
00:17:32,601 --> 00:17:36,890
you've got wheat for one to where we had
neil hamburger opened up for us.

388
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:38,000
Oh,
that's awesome.

389
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:38,810
You know.
So that's just.

390
00:17:38,811 --> 00:17:41,180
And then in the middle of our study 
would come out and interrupt and go,

391
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:46,190
I forgot a joke and then you know,
just from the audience out for a minute 

392
00:17:46,641 --> 00:17:50,220
and then wander off and that can take my
drink and my chair

393
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:53,830
and sit down and like in my spot and 
take up space for western Europe.

394
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:56,250
What was the song that you guys did 
where you filmed the video?

395
00:17:56,251 --> 00:18:01,251
Inside of a trailer?
It's sort of a condition or conditions 

396
00:18:01,251 --> 00:18:01,680
of my parole that's fucking song is 
great.

397
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:04,170
Is that you're really your airstream.
Is that your personal?

398
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:09,760
So jealous.
I want to buy one so bad at talking 

399
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,320
about getting one as a portable.
A podcast studio.

400
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:11,110
No,
we should do,

401
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:13,440
do that.
And then come to people's towns and do.

402
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:18,810
Because we could have a four G,
four g connection for verizon.

403
00:18:18,961 --> 00:18:21,920
That's pretty Goddamn sporty.
If we just find a place that can support

404
00:18:21,921 --> 00:18:23,710
the show,
we would have to have a.

405
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:29,030
We would have to have one for each show.
Like we'd have to have a contract for 

406
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:29,040
each show because then we'd go over our 
data.

407
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:33,210
So it would have to get like 50 of them.
We would have to get a sponsor.

408
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:36,450
Will this team ting wants a sponsor of 
something new,

409
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,900
some new rather cell phone company.
Maybe they could do that.

410
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:40,500
Oh,
that's cool.

411
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,940
So you,
you,

412
00:18:42,941 --> 00:18:45,150
um,
when you got into Hex for me,

413
00:18:45,151 --> 00:18:50,151
I was a young comedian living in Boston 
and I was working at the comedy 

414
00:18:50,701 --> 00:18:55,701
connection.
I had been doing it probably about a 

415
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:55,701
year,
so it was probably like 1989.

416
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:57,180
Would you live in Boston?
I live in Newton.

417
00:18:58,090 --> 00:18:59,850
I live in Davis Square.
How did you really?

418
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:00,480
Oh,
cool.

419
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:02,880
I used to work at Boston pet center down
on leach mere.

420
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:04,430
Oh really?
It's not there anymore.

421
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,480
Nice.
Some awful something there.

422
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,420
Boston is a great place to grow up,
but a terrible place to die.

423
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:13,020
And I felt like I was dying there.
Yeah.

424
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,730
It's like the people are cool.

425
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:16,440
They're smart.
It's interesting.

426
00:19:16,441 --> 00:19:18,450
It's cool.
It's a real town,

427
00:19:18,451 --> 00:19:21,390
but it's too fucking cold.
It's just too fucking old.

428
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:26,450
I feel like it's,
it's like I kind of feel like there's a 

429
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:27,090
parallel between San Francisco and 
Boston in a way.

430
00:19:27,091 --> 00:19:30,990
As far as that bitter cold.
Let's take San Fran everyday son.

431
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:36,110
I'll take San Fran all day.
I like San Fran have maybe 100 times 

432
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:36,820
better than Boston,
but I and I,

433
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:38,180
I guess like,
yeah,

434
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,430
I'll take that.
I just,

435
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:44,290
I think the sand France had just changed
their licensed places.

436
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,310
Say you're doing it wrong.
Yeah.

437
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:49,580
You think they're doing it wrong.
They just know what you're doing.

438
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,690
No matter what you're doing,
you're doing it wrong.

439
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:52,340
They,
they,

440
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,400
they go over the deep end,
but they go over my preferable and that 

441
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,350
goes.
They go over the lefty deepen,

442
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:02,370
which seems weird coming from like a 
cage fighting commentator type dude.

443
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:04,170
But I don't,
you know,

444
00:20:04,171 --> 00:20:09,171
I,
I like people that are kind and I think 

445
00:20:09,171 --> 00:20:11,721
that even if the people on the left are 
doing it the wrong way and even if 

446
00:20:11,721 --> 00:20:13,440
they're crazy and self righteous and 
pretentious,

447
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:18,860
I think the idea behind it is they're 
trying to be as kind to as many groups 

448
00:20:18,991 --> 00:20:23,991
of people you know and offer a 
commensurate environment for as many 

449
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:30,140
groups of people as possible.
So I support that even though I think a 

450
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:32,961
lot of what they think is nonsense and 
it doesn't go along with human nature 

451
00:20:32,961 --> 00:20:37,260
and behavior and Alpha them sometimes it
grabbed their neck and shake them like a

452
00:20:37,261 --> 00:20:40,740
fucking child and we'll get it to go 
that bitch do some squats,

453
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:43,200
have a fucking stake.
You're,

454
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:46,280
you're on planet Earth Bacon.
Get up,

455
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:48,780
bitch up.
Have a fucking shot of whiskey.

456
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:52,460
Let's do this.
I just a Boston is just a,

457
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:56,470
a Boston is liberal in the same way too,
but just angry.

458
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:57,190
Oh yeah,
there's,

459
00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:02,210
there's definitely some.
There was some Irish anger going on 

460
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:02,330
there and ugly cold.
Yeah.

461
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:07,350
I got really in trouble once I toured 
there and like it was like one of my 

462
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:07,350
first times back in Boston.
It's like,

463
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:09,270
back be back in Boston,
dry capital

464
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:11,580
world.
Crickets.

465
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:15,100
Like no,
as many fans as we were like,

466
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:15,840
yeah,
we're not,

467
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:16,520
we're done there.

468
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:23,500
Capital of the world.
It's hard to find a good one in Boston.

469
00:21:23,501 --> 00:21:28,501
And when you find a good,
when you cling to them like a cork in 

470
00:21:28,501 --> 00:21:28,501
the ocean,
please keep me afloat,

471
00:21:28,501 --> 00:21:29,930
please.
Um,

472
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,160
I saw him at the comedy connection and 
uh,

473
00:21:33,161 --> 00:21:37,110
I saw him because he was on the Rodney 
Dangerfield special and uh,

474
00:21:37,111 --> 00:21:39,270
you know,
I was an aspiring comedian.

475
00:21:39,271 --> 00:21:44,271
So I went to see everybody was on the 
Rodney dangerfield special when they 

476
00:21:44,271 --> 00:21:44,580
came through town and Boston was one of 
those pit stops.

477
00:21:44,581 --> 00:21:45,960
It was like Chicago,
Boston,

478
00:21:45,961 --> 00:21:47,340
you know,
there was places where people would come

479
00:21:47,341 --> 00:21:52,341
through and you know,
you would guarantee that they would be 

480
00:21:52,341 --> 00:21:52,680
in your town eventually.
And uh,

481
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:56,580
Hicks went up,
he went up at the comedy connection,

482
00:21:56,730 --> 00:22:01,730
or the first time I actually saw him was
at Nick's comedy stop and he went up 

483
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:02,820
after this guy was incredible hack.

484
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:06,080
The guy was like cop donut jokes,
cartoons,

485
00:22:06,081 --> 00:22:10,050
smoking pot and make them all the most 
hackneyed obvious premises.

486
00:22:10,051 --> 00:22:12,660
And he was killing audiences,
filled idiots.

487
00:22:12,661 --> 00:22:17,661
Nobody knew who Hicks was.
Me and maybe 50 other comedians in the 

488
00:22:17,661 --> 00:22:21,021
back of the room at a 300 people who 
were in the audience places packed by 20

489
00:22:21,571 --> 00:22:24,090
minutes into the show.
Half the people have left,

490
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:26,700
you know,
I mean literally cleared out at least 50

491
00:22:26,701 --> 00:22:31,701
percent by the end of it,
it was maybe 100 people left and it was 

492
00:22:31,701 --> 00:22:33,480
a 50 audience members in 50 comedians.
And we.

493
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,560
And he didn't give a fuck.
He never came.

494
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:39,690
I was,
one joke would go wrong for me.

495
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:42,900
I would go into a tailspin.
I would panic,

496
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:44,140
I would go,
Duh.

497
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:47,520
I would rush my jokes.
I would say fuck too much.

498
00:22:47,521 --> 00:22:48,240
I would just,
I would,

499
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:52,350
I would not have any confidence.
He's in the middle of this bit about how

500
00:22:52,351 --> 00:22:56,280
Satan fugs John Davidson,
who don't remember John Davidson,

501
00:22:56,281 --> 00:22:57,770
was the host of.
That's incredible.

502
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,680
It was,
was the,

503
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:01,110
you know,
one of them,

504
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,180
it was like the Internet before there 
was the internet,

505
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:08,300
so it's a demon with his thorny cock is 
fucking John Davidson in the ass and 

506
00:23:10,741 --> 00:23:15,741
John Davidson swells up and the off 
season because he's pregnant with 

507
00:23:15,741 --> 00:23:18,250
Lucifer's baby and he shits out Oprah 
Winfrey or,

508
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:21,780
or Geraldo Rivera depending on where 
Hicks was at.

509
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:25,560
And so hicks is standing onstage 
shitting.

510
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:27,150
So he's pausing going,

511
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:35,620
I mean it's fucking minutes,
10 minutes of just just straining and 

512
00:23:36,531 --> 00:23:40,040
people just getting up and leaving and 
he looks up in the middle of it goes.

513
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:45,860
It's usually clears the room.
We're

514
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:51,010
just flying in and I got to see him bomb
horribly but yet still kill for 50 to 

515
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,300
100 people.
And then I got,

516
00:23:55,301 --> 00:23:57,860
I got him.
You kill for the whole,

517
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:01,820
the whole crowd.
But what an interesting guy.

518
00:24:01,821 --> 00:24:05,330
It's like he was doing something that 
nobody else was doing.

519
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:08,340
He was like,
he was injecting Noam Chomsky and,

520
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:08,850
and,
and,

521
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,720
and philosophy.
And Terence Mckenna.

522
00:24:11,721 --> 00:24:13,370
And it was like,
whoa.

523
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:18,380
Like I didn't even like when I first saw
Kennison kinison was the first time I 

524
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:19,860
ever thought I could do comedy.
I was like,

525
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:24,940
you know,
I saw these guys rolling up their 

526
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:24,940
sleeves talking about did you ever 
notice?

527
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:27,380
And it's like,
well I kinda Kinda could do that.

528
00:24:27,381 --> 00:24:29,390
I guess I kind of could do that if I had
to do that.

529
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:32,450
But then I saw kinison and,
and you know,

530
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:37,480
fucking came and I was married and he 
was angry and it was funny and I was 

531
00:24:38,241 --> 00:24:38,660
laughing.

532
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:43,660
I was like,
maybe that maybe there's a comedy for 

533
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:43,660
me,
maybe I could find my comedy.

534
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:44,950
Right.
And then when I saw him,

535
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,250
so I was like,
oh,

536
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:49,760
this guy just flipped the whole fucking 
thing on its head.

537
00:24:49,761 --> 00:24:52,220
Like now it's now it's,
you know,

538
00:24:52,221 --> 00:24:57,221
it's about formulating a philosophy on 
life and that there is a possibility 

539
00:24:58,341 --> 00:25:00,530
outside of the direction that we're 
going in.

540
00:25:00,531 --> 00:25:03,590
And then it is possible for the human 
beings and the,

541
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,100
you know,
the,

542
00:25:04,101 --> 00:25:06,640
the human civilization to rise up and,
and,

543
00:25:06,641 --> 00:25:09,050
and be about love and be about 
understanding.

544
00:25:09,051 --> 00:25:14,030
It'd be about intellectual curiosity and
to be free of judgment.

545
00:25:14,031 --> 00:25:16,120
I was like,
this guy's a fucking comedian.

546
00:25:16,121 --> 00:25:18,170
Like this is the craziest Shit I've ever
seen.

547
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:23,700
It's almost like his jokes were an 
afterthought to inject this philosophy 

548
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:23,930
into the audience.

549
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,950
I think partly.
Yeah,

550
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:27,750
absolutely.
But I've loved.

551
00:25:27,751 --> 00:25:28,150
I,
you know,

552
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:33,170
I kind of like a spend a little.
I spent all the time in that little 

553
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:37,431
comedy world for awhile,
was very always very inspiring to me to 

554
00:25:37,431 --> 00:25:40,191
watch comedians like him basically just 
stick to their guns and finish their ach

555
00:25:40,321 --> 00:25:42,030
without getting that nervous sweat.
I mean,

556
00:25:42,031 --> 00:25:47,031
it was always inspiring to see that.
And it's always my favorite comedy clubs

557
00:25:48,061 --> 00:25:49,540
to go to were the ones that,
you know,

558
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,350
you end up if you're sitting out front 
of,

559
00:25:51,351 --> 00:25:52,620
uh,
the Mann's Chinese,

560
00:25:52,621 --> 00:25:55,560
they give you tickets to go to this free
comedy club,

561
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:59,250
go then because if it's a good comedian 
on,

562
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:02,760
he can like take bets to see how quickly
the room's going to clear.

563
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:09,680
And we had a,
I think I remember one time he had andy 

564
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,441
kindler did a whole thing where he 
brought everybody he knew down there to 

565
00:26:12,441 --> 00:26:15,090
kind of have like a little,
a side side seats with all the comedians

566
00:26:15,091 --> 00:26:17,760
that he had an abyss leave and they did 
a whole,

567
00:26:17,761 --> 00:26:20,730
like a debunking comedy,
like a,

568
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:25,760
like a hack hack a class and they had 
everybody come up and just do like the 

569
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,720
hack thing in front of this audience and
this,

570
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:29,670
all these people that just kind of one 
tickets from,

571
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:34,720
you know,
got tickets to the man saying isn't 

572
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:34,720
there just,
I don't understand.

573
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,270
Like that's funny.
Why is that hack?

574
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,620
That's funny.
And then,

575
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:42,740
you know,
that whole thing went on for like an 

576
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:42,740
hour,
hour and a half.

577
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:42,740
I was just,
I'm in the back of the room,

578
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,950
just peeing myself.
Them go through this.

579
00:26:43,951 --> 00:26:44,100
And

580
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:49,100
then some dude gets out after them as 
their act and does everything that they 

581
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,070
just went through and the audience is 
like,

582
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,890
oh that's so funny.
Can I have another break?

583
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:58,140
And then David Cross gets up and then 
just clears the room was awesome.

584
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,840
Opening line,
just,

585
00:27:00,841 --> 00:27:02,660
you know,
I saw Schindler's list the other day,

586
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:05,940
Schindler's list finally saw it.
It's not that funny.

587
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:09,570
This whole table of people just get up 
and out the door like,

588
00:27:09,571 --> 00:27:10,980
and it just,
every joke that he said,

589
00:27:10,981 --> 00:27:15,981
it was like,
we're watching like me just set off a 

590
00:27:15,981 --> 00:27:15,981
bomb there.
He just set off a bomb.

591
00:27:15,981 --> 00:27:17,890
They cleared the room.
Was Crosses,

592
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:23,210
rarely credited,
but in my opinion of watching it all 

593
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:26,211
happen,
he's the originator of the idea of 

594
00:27:26,211 --> 00:27:27,660
alternative comedy because I saw him do 
an alternative comedy in 1988.

595
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:32,460
He was in Boston and Cambridge.
He would go up and he would do,

596
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:34,800
I remember one time he was doing this,
this,

597
00:27:34,801 --> 00:27:37,620
uh,
exercise video where would teach you,

598
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:39,060
teach you how to stretch.

599
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:41,430
So you've played the exercise.
Video districts.

600
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:46,600
I really do feel a stretch and he was 
like doing this like long and people 

601
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:50,790
like nervously giggling and not showing,
were not sure where it was going and it 

602
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:52,430
never went anywhere.
It never went anywhere.

603
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,630
But it was amusing.
I felt,

604
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:59,631
I felt he was like a better version of 
what I'm Andy Kaufman was doing because 

605
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:04,940
Andy Kaufman would get up in front of 
like colleges and like read the great 

606
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:05,880
gatsby and I was like,
well that's Kinda fucked.

607
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:09,150
It's not really funny at all.
Like this is kind of crazy.

608
00:28:09,151 --> 00:28:10,980
Like it is now.
It is now.

609
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:16,010
Yeah.
It's like a delayed reaction to like 

610
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:17,160
witness it as great longterm absorption.
But Cross was.

611
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,870
He was funny while I was doing.
It was,

612
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:20,790
it was weird.
He was just so silly.

613
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:22,680
It was actually funny while he was doing
it.

614
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:28,100
Do you like comedy?
I like music because I'm completely 

615
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,720
unmusical.
I don't have any skill.

616
00:28:30,721 --> 00:28:32,600
I don't have any talent.
I don't have.

617
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:35,580
I don't understand it.
I don't see those bars.

618
00:28:35,581 --> 00:28:38,490
That might as well be Tibetan.
You know,

619
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:40,470
Sanskrit.
I don't know what it is.

620
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:43,960
So when I see someone perform music,
when I,

621
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:45,720
when I'm in awe,
it's like,

622
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:48,360
to me it's a beautiful,
wonderful experience.

623
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:51,570
Do you feel the same way about comedy 
because you don't do comedy?

624
00:28:51,571 --> 00:28:56,571
Do you watch comedy and just get a free 
sense of enjoyment that you might not 

625
00:28:56,571 --> 00:28:58,080
get from watching something that you 
actually,

626
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:03,620
I generally enjoy more scripted like a 
film comedy when I see a group of guys 

627
00:29:03,961 --> 00:29:06,590
who have figured out not a formula,
but there's just a,

628
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:11,690
there's a rhythm to their comedy and 
they've actually created a character 

629
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:11,690
behind,
you know,

630
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:14,460
that actor brings something to the table
that you want to look at.

631
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:19,700
And then their timing in this scenario 
where it's clearly there are just play 

632
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:19,700
acting.
It's like,

633
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:24,081
hey,
we're just playing dress up pretend and 

634
00:29:24,081 --> 00:29:24,081
you still laugh because the writing 
solid,

635
00:29:24,081 --> 00:29:28,761
but the,
what they bring to the table with their 

636
00:29:28,761 --> 00:29:28,761
writing is solid.
So like,

637
00:29:28,761 --> 00:29:28,761
you know,
when you're seeing things like,

638
00:29:28,761 --> 00:29:30,030
uh,
the movie super troopers,

639
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:35,060
it's just like,
those guys had to have a lot of fun 

640
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:35,060
making that film because everything was 
just like,

641
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:36,930
the writing was perfect.
It's a quotable film.

642
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,760
It's like every step of the way.
It's every,

643
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:41,980
every scene is quotable and they're 
having fun.

644
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,260
And then you see,
you know,

645
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:46,600
almost almost any will farrell brothers,
those guys just.

646
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,830
Yeah.
Uh,

647
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:52,920
John C dot reilly's,
like just a master at just bringing his 

648
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,580
thing to the table and then making your 
script come alive.

649
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:57,130
It's just a great.
That to me is like,

650
00:29:57,131 --> 00:29:58,510
and I,
and I look at that and I go,

651
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:03,990
what the fuck did you do that?
I have no idea how they did that and I 

652
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:07,081
have no idea how to be funny.
I just saw I'm watching them just like 

653
00:30:07,081 --> 00:30:09,930
nail these things out of the park.
Like you could put all that script on 

654
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:09,930
the paper and show it to me and I would 
just go,

655
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:12,160
which I don't have where to start.
Like,

656
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:13,750
you know,
how is this funny?

657
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:18,070
One of my favorite all time Comedians is
Mitch Hedberg and one of the reasons why

658
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:21,250
Mitch is one of my favorites is because 
none of his stuff was funny on paper.

659
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:24,460
It didn't make any sense.
Like you would see that he goes,

660
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:27,790
it was somebody asked me do I want a 
frozen banana?

661
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:28,990
I said,
no,

662
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:32,440
but I want a regular banana later.
So yes.

663
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,000
Now if you saw that on paper and be 
like,

664
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,220
why is that funny?
What the fuck is,

665
00:30:39,221 --> 00:30:42,280
I might have butchered his joke.
I don't think it was pretty close,

666
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:44,410
but I,
I love that.

667
00:30:44,411 --> 00:30:47,890
I love that he redefined comedy in a 
certain way to.

668
00:30:47,891 --> 00:30:48,880
Because he,
he made,

669
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:54,210
first of all,
I was a heroin addict and he had only 

670
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:56,740
clean comedy.
I mean his stuff was squeaky clean.

671
00:30:57,510 --> 00:31:02,510
Meanwhile he was gang green and his leg,
because he was fucking shooting in this 

672
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:03,370
same vein too many times.

673
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:08,860
It was really a strange guy and his 
material was all so odd and if you loved

674
00:31:13,021 --> 00:31:17,440
Mitch Hedberg it was awesome.
But like Mitch Hedberg would go on after

675
00:31:17,441 --> 00:31:21,320
these guys that would like sing and 
dance and do song parodies and you know,

676
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:24,460
they would close with a rap and he would
eat dick.

677
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:29,610
He would eat dick so bad that the club 
owner would try to switch him with the 

678
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:30,600
Middle Act and say,
listen,

679
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:33,220
the Middle East has been doing stronger.
We're going to have him close.

680
00:31:33,221 --> 00:31:35,250
We're going to give him your money.
And then they're,

681
00:31:35,251 --> 00:31:40,251
you know,
his manager would call it and it'd be 

682
00:31:40,251 --> 00:31:41,880
like a big problem.
And it wasn't necessarily that he was a 

683
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,000
not a,
not a funny comic,

684
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:47,950
it was like it was completely the wrong 
setup for his type of comedy.

685
00:31:47,951 --> 00:31:52,951
Whereas it's a delicate environment 
where you could take a guy like Kennis 

686
00:31:52,951 --> 00:31:53,560
and it didn't matter who went on before 
him,

687
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:58,710
when he stormed out of this fucking room
has changed.

688
00:31:59,351 --> 00:32:04,351
The environment has changed.
Hedberg would get up there with 

689
00:32:04,351 --> 00:32:04,351
sunglasses on,
you know,

690
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:08,800
and it just goes,
bear never played tennis against a wall.

691
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:13,801
They're relentless.
You would just start giggling and it 

692
00:32:16,831 --> 00:32:18,880
would,
it would be a slow build.

693
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,200
And he was one of the rare guys that 
would have a nonsequitors.

694
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:24,610
Everything was being nonsequitor every 
single bit.

695
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:27,010
I'm sorry,
what is that drawing on the wall?

696
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:32,220
That's a vagina.
That's what a child would draw like in 

697
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:32,220
high school maybe.

698
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:36,430
And in Walsh's a drawing of what he 
thinks Barbie looks like.

699
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:39,120
And it's right next to Pam Anderson up.

700
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:45,530
We had an artist on one of our other 
podcasts to interrupt you,

701
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:49,580
but I just kept screaming at me.
This whole place is a giant distraction.

702
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:51,260
Look,
there's a flashlight right here.

703
00:32:51,261 --> 00:32:54,260
Are former sponsor fucking cats all over
the table.

704
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:56,110
Super Mario brothers behind the 
appointment.

705
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:00,350
There's a mannequin tit stormtrooper 
helmet.

706
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:02,480
Ron Paul's in here somewhere.
Where's Ron?

707
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:03,920
Ron?
Paul's over there somewhere.

708
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:05,900
She's leaving.

709
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:07,140
Yeah.
Yeah.

710
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:12,160
It's a.
This is a weird little setup we have 

711
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:12,160
here.
What is what?

712
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:12,160
That fucking painting,
man.

713
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:12,810
That's what I've been wanting to ask.

714
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:16,570
Yours burned that thing.
If you look far away,

715
00:33:16,571 --> 00:33:18,310
if you.
If you look at it far away,

716
00:33:18,311 --> 00:33:21,370
it looks like a naked girl.
Shit.

717
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:24,730
Thanks Joe.
Thanks a lot man.

718
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:25,780
Appreciate it.

719
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:29,960
I only said that for humor.
I really mean that.

720
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:35,070
So I have.
I have questions for you and it's a 

721
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:39,190
regarding Anderson Silva.
I want to know what you think is coming 

722
00:33:39,771 --> 00:33:40,360
next.
So this,

723
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:42,620
you're gonna.
Are you on the inside of that?

724
00:33:42,621 --> 00:33:47,621
Is it a what's happening?
Most likely it will be one of two 

725
00:33:47,621 --> 00:33:52,481
things.
Depending on what they can talk them 

726
00:33:52,481 --> 00:33:54,101
into.
Anderson is a very rare position where 

727
00:33:54,101 --> 00:33:55,070
he sort of gets chooses opponents for 
the most part.

728
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,690
It'll be there,
you know,

729
00:33:56,750 --> 00:34:01,750
based on like he didn't want to fight 
Chael Sonnen because he talks so much 

730
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:01,750
shit.
He didn't want to do it,

731
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,320
but he also did because he wanted to 
silence them,

732
00:34:03,321 --> 00:34:05,630
so they just had a financially motivated
them.

733
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:09,740
It will most likely be either this kid,
Chris Weidman,

734
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:14,690
who's the best up and coming 195 pounds 
or one of the best.

735
00:34:14,691 --> 00:34:17,180
He hasn't fought a lot of guys,
but he's a,

736
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:18,590
I think I've heard about stamping.

737
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:23,620
Pretty solid dude.
Just destroyed Mark Munoz who's also a 

738
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:27,101
top 10 contender.
And the way he did it was just so just 

739
00:34:27,101 --> 00:34:30,830
complete and total the way he 
anticipated all of his moves countered.

740
00:34:30,831 --> 00:34:33,580
I'm almost strangled them three or four 
times the first day.

741
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:34,560
Pretty Young Kid,
right?

742
00:34:34,561 --> 00:34:36,680
Yeah.
And a spectacular wrestler.

743
00:34:36,681 --> 00:34:38,960
So it's him.
He might get it,

744
00:34:38,961 --> 00:34:41,840
but he's,
he's a bit of a tough sell because,

745
00:34:41,841 --> 00:34:43,670
uh,
there's a lot of folks in the mainstream

746
00:34:43,671 --> 00:34:45,710
that don't know who he is.
He's more of a,

747
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:48,620
someone who he.
He can beat Anderson Silva.

748
00:34:48,621 --> 00:34:53,621
I mean,
look who the fuck knows what's gonna 

749
00:34:53,621 --> 00:34:55,100
actually happen.
But it may be possible that he could 

750
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:55,100
pull it off.
He has the right set of skills,

751
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:57,090
but he's not known as well.
Um,

752
00:34:57,140 --> 00:35:01,280
but the other option is if George St 
Pierre Beats Carlos Condit.

753
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:05,360
Okay then,
then they have some fucking crazy Susan.

754
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:10,540
Is that the guy that they mentioned at 
the end of the fight when they were 

755
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:11,900
saying so are you going to fight him?

756
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,970
And he went to find him.
Oh No,

757
00:35:13,971 --> 00:35:15,140
that's John Jones.
Okay.

758
00:35:15,141 --> 00:35:15,930
John's right.
Yeah.

759
00:35:15,931 --> 00:35:17,270
You said he doesn't want to fight Jon 
Jones,

760
00:35:17,271 --> 00:35:20,420
but Jon Jones really isn't a totally 
different weight class.

761
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:23,840
Not just Anderson has dabbled in the 205
pound weight class,

762
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:26,540
but really he makes one 85 pretty 
easily.

763
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:31,570
He doesn't have a problem making one 85 
a and John Jones could never make one 

764
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:32,960
85.
John Jones is six foot three,

765
00:35:32,961 --> 00:35:36,740
240 pounds to 30 least when he's walking
around.

766
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:38,150
And then he cuts down to two.
Oh,

767
00:35:38,151 --> 00:35:39,360
five slowly,
you know,

768
00:35:39,361 --> 00:35:40,510
over his camp.
You know,

769
00:35:40,511 --> 00:35:45,511
cut.
Probably cut my loses the last probably 

770
00:35:45,511 --> 00:35:46,170
10 pounds in water weight.
He's just a way bigger guy.

771
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:51,260
He's way bigger and he's a really strong
wrestler and stylistically he's a 

772
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:53,010
nightmare and apparently they have a 
mutual admiration for each other.

773
00:35:53,011 --> 00:35:57,150
That's it can,
it can be bypassed,

774
00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:02,260
you know,
with the right amount of money and both 

775
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:02,260
guys probably agreed to it if the right 
amount of money on the table,

776
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,420
but right now,
you know,

777
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:08,630
they both stated their admiration for 
each other and they're probably number 

778
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:12,081
one and number two,
pound for pound fighters in the world 

779
00:36:12,081 --> 00:36:12,081
right now.

780
00:36:12,081 --> 00:36:14,750
People would like to see that.
But honestly I think George St Pierre 

781
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:15,630
and Anderson are more physically the 
same size.

782
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:16,580
It's closer.
Okay.

783
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:20,620
George has a struggle to make one 70 
whereas Anderson is a,

784
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:23,370
uh,
he makes one 85 pretty easy.

785
00:36:23,371 --> 00:36:28,371
George could make one 85 and be the 
basically the same size and that would 

786
00:36:28,371 --> 00:36:32,391
be an amazing fight that I think if,
if George can get through Carlos condit 

787
00:36:32,391 --> 00:36:35,040
and that they believe they're going to 
fight in the fall,

788
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:38,490
depending on George's recovering from an
acl surgery.

789
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:40,570
Okay.
So yeah.

790
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:41,960
Yeah.
I've had to.

791
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:45,300
And if George gets through that and 
everything's cool that,

792
00:36:45,301 --> 00:36:46,890
uh,
and if he beats Carlos Condit,

793
00:36:46,891 --> 00:36:47,910
which is an f,
you know,

794
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:50,220
Carlos has really good,
he's a very tough.

795
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:55,250
But if he beats him then they go to 
probably a Dallas stadium,

796
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,680
probably doing that big giant fucking 
60,000

797
00:36:58,681 --> 00:36:59,970
square foot.
That'd be awesome.

798
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:02,330
That'd be.
I'm just looking forward to the next,

799
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:07,340
you know,
on the community with what happens next 

800
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:09,070
because I was,
that was a pretty amazing Anderson's a,

801
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:10,470
uh,
he's a Ninja.

802
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,760
I mean,
he really is.

803
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:17,150
He's a real master martial artists in a 
way that like what,

804
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:20,320
what he does,
there's maybe a,

805
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:24,440
a tiny handful of human beings on the 
planet who can move the way he moves.

806
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:26,520
And so I think going back to some of 
that,

807
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:29,430
you know,
that relaxed state we were talking about

808
00:37:29,431 --> 00:37:30,140
before,
I just,

809
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:32,970
it's really watching him,
watching him operate.

810
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:35,500
It's,
it is like Jordan at his,

811
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:37,170
at his top,
top of his game.

812
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:38,760
That's just the panther,
this,

813
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:41,600
this art,
this ballet movement.

814
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:42,250
Uh,
just,

815
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:44,100
just a fluid.
Yeah.

816
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,870
And a connected.
Um,

817
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:47,660
and I think a lot.
I think a lot of that's just,

818
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:50,520
it seemed like a lot of that's missing 
from the UFC these days right here.

819
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:53,040
Any mixed martial arts forum that seems 
to lead.

820
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:54,590
There's that,
you know,

821
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:58,350
there's the awesome gladiator go,
you know what to do is bang it out,

822
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:02,490
but there's that art that I just kind of
missed from the earlier days of watching

823
00:38:02,491 --> 00:38:04,980
it be the,
that the bracket system where you had to

824
00:38:04,981 --> 00:38:06,370
kind of,
you know,

825
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,540
suck it up and get through three dudes 
in one night.

826
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,580
You know,
the old wrestling days.

827
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:12,930
Well,
what Anderson is,

828
00:38:12,931 --> 00:38:16,980
is so much better than everyone else 
that you get to see that art.

829
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:21,330
Whereas like you see a couple of dudes 
that are really close to each other,

830
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,810
go at it.
You don't eat.

831
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:26,030
They don't have that,
that,

832
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:31,090
that,
that giant skill level above their 

833
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:32,610
opponent.
Whereas Anderson does like when it comes

834
00:38:32,611 --> 00:38:36,730
to striking Anderson's,
the most accurate fighter we've ever had

835
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:41,731
inside the octagon.
Like no one has been as accurate with 

836
00:38:41,731 --> 00:38:41,731
him and he's,
he's so,

837
00:38:41,731 --> 00:38:43,840
he's so fluid in the way he moves.

838
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:49,200
He does things and its opponents don't 
even realize he's done them until they 

839
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:49,630
land and you're like,
what?

840
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:52,960
He's like the master of like sneaking 
shit in.

841
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:57,730
It's a really unusual dude and the 
reason why he's able to do that,

842
00:38:57,731 --> 00:39:02,731
as you know,
mixed martial arts as a whole is really 

843
00:39:02,731 --> 00:39:05,290
only been around since 1993 and we're 
seeing this constant evolution of it,

844
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:10,590
but Anderson represents at right now 
what's possible the furthest,

845
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:13,690
furthest evolution of the game as far as
it's ever gone.

846
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:18,460
But the reality is in his individual 
disciplines,

847
00:39:18,461 --> 00:39:22,220
he's not as good as the best guys.
There are better kickboxers therapy,

848
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:27,260
better Jujitsu guys like him and it's 
like one day we're going to see a guy 

849
00:39:27,551 --> 00:39:32,551
who can do to Anderson Silva,
what Anderson Silva could do details on 

850
00:39:32,551 --> 00:39:32,551
it.
I mean,

851
00:39:32,551 --> 00:39:36,931
we haven't seen it yet,
but we're going to see a guy who has 

852
00:39:36,931 --> 00:39:38,590
hixon Gracie Jujitsu and bought her rate
type striking.

853
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:39,340
Right?
You know,

854
00:39:39,341 --> 00:39:41,720
and when that happens,
I mean the man and that's.

855
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:46,870
It's inevitable.
It's the sport is moving in that 

856
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:49,801
direction.
It's like this constantly accelerating 

857
00:39:49,801 --> 00:39:52,321
process and right now it's the only 
people that are successful are the 

858
00:39:52,321 --> 00:39:54,880
completely fanatical and obsessed.
You can't get by and sheer athleticism.

859
00:39:55,340 --> 00:40:00,340
You see some basketball players that 
they probably don't work out as hard as 

860
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:00,500
they could and you know,
they maybe don't,

861
00:40:00,501 --> 00:40:05,501
but,
but they're good enough to get by and 

862
00:40:05,501 --> 00:40:05,501
they have enough gifts to get by in the 
pro basketball player,

863
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,310
tall and arrogant.
When you get to the,

864
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:12,600
when you get to the top,
the upper echelons of the ultimate 

865
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:15,481
fighting championship.
There's no room for anybody but the 

866
00:40:15,481 --> 00:40:17,941
fanatical.
There's no room for anybody but the 

867
00:40:17,941 --> 00:40:18,100
obsessed and the Rory Mcdonald's of the 
world,

868
00:40:18,101 --> 00:40:20,980
these young guys that are coming up that
are just insanely good.

869
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:25,980
And every time you see them,
they're much better than they were six 

870
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:25,980
months ago.
That's the future.

871
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:28,090
And that's one that's inspiring because 
it's,

872
00:40:28,091 --> 00:40:28,470
it's,
uh,

873
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:33,510
it's definitely that,
that chess game that we spoke of 

874
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:36,541
earlier.
I feel like it's more interesting to 

875
00:40:36,541 --> 00:40:38,701
watch because although I don't have 
necessarily the frame of reference for 

876
00:40:38,701 --> 00:40:41,911
what's actually happening,
when you actually go back and look at 

877
00:40:41,911 --> 00:40:41,911
the tape and go click by,
click and go,

878
00:40:41,911 --> 00:40:46,590
oh my God,
that's exactly what you're talking 

879
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:46,960
about,
John and your corner just going this and

880
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,670
this.
It's,

881
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:52,810
it's a chest moves and it's millimeters 
and with a guy like Anderson,

882
00:40:52,811 --> 00:40:55,900
there's no one to tell him to do that 
because he's that guy.

883
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:58,060
You know?
Anderson really doesn't have it.

884
00:40:58,061 --> 00:41:03,061
I mean,
he has guys that coach him and Moitai 

885
00:41:03,061 --> 00:41:05,340
and coach them in Jujitsu when it comes 
to mma and nobody always going to tell 

886
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:07,210
editors what to do and knows exactly 
what to do.

887
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:10,450
He's at the top of the mountain.
It's beautiful to watch someone who's at

888
00:41:10,451 --> 00:41:13,220
the very best of the,
the like the,

889
00:41:13,221 --> 00:41:16,330
the peak,
the apex of whatever that is right now.

890
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:21,680
You know,
whether it's fucking motorcycle racing 

891
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:21,680
or whatever it is,
gymnastics.

892
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:25,711
When you see a guy who was at the,
there's a quote from the movie vision 

893
00:41:25,711 --> 00:41:26,020
quest.
Did you ever see that movie?

894
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:29,140
Matthew Modine?
Remember that moving good fucking movie,

895
00:41:29,141 --> 00:41:30,220
man.
Why are you laughing right now?

896
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:31,870
Why am I laughing?
That's a great.

897
00:41:31,871 --> 00:41:34,330
Because I forgot all about it.
I haven't watched it lately though.

898
00:41:34,331 --> 00:41:36,170
In event held up,
we should watch it now.

899
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:37,700
We should list.
What's the girl's name?

900
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:40,250
The girl with the black hair.
It was hot as fuck.

901
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:45,570
I'm member.
She moved into his house and he was 

902
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:46,910
caught smelling her panties.
Sylvester stallone.

903
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,820
Yes.
I'm.

904
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:54,640
Anyway,
there's a scene in the movie where the 

905
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,010
guy is a google that now the kid is the 
top and you know,

906
00:41:57,390 --> 00:42:02,390
he's like one of the top wrestlers and 
he's about to face a state champion 

907
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:06,311
wrestler and is huge thing and he's 
blown away by it and he's working as a 

908
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:12,010
delivery man at a hotel is working as a 
room service guy and one of the cooks in

909
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:17,351
the hotel and him have this conversation
about the guy seeing a Palae or I think 

910
00:42:18,741 --> 00:42:23,741
it was Paleo,
but I've seen some incredible soccer 

911
00:42:23,741 --> 00:42:24,650
game and seeing this guy do something 
that just for that one moment you.

912
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:29,780
You rejoiced in that guy's movements in 
his ability to do something astounding.

913
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:34,960
And for one moment I like it.
Raised the entire group of people that 

914
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:39,161
were watching it.
For one moment we were above the apes 

915
00:42:39,161 --> 00:42:39,161
were above.
Right?

916
00:42:39,161 --> 00:42:42,100
The Shit chucking monkeys.
You know Linda Florentina.

917
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:43,250
Oh,
she was so hot.

918
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:46,520
Soon as ridiculous.
Whatever happened to her sex change.

919
00:42:46,521 --> 00:42:46,990
She.
Nelson.

920
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:48,050
She.
Yeah,

921
00:42:48,051 --> 00:42:51,620
she's awesome.
She actually doesn't look that bad.

922
00:42:51,621 --> 00:42:56,621
Now you got to Google photo over.
I mean for being a target semester.

923
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:03,830
Ostalgie Candle Light One candle.
Corner of the room.

924
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:05,330
Don't see that much.
Everybody's good.

925
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:07,560
I apologize.
Linda.

926
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,970
You don't want to wrestle.
Storm Susan Dogma.

927
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:16,240
Weird.
Weird that you even know who was in dog 

928
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:16,370
ma?
Did you see dogma?

929
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,140
Dogma?
I win.

930
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:22,850
Okay.
Who doesn't even know?

931
00:43:23,570 --> 00:43:25,540
What's the,
the old uh.

932
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:27,410
Oh Man.
I'm going to blow this.

933
00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:29,210
All right.
So,

934
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:33,320
uh,
so has John Travolta Greece.

935
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:35,180
Oh yeah.
Have you seen Greece?

936
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:36,590
Yes,
I watched it all the time.

937
00:43:36,591 --> 00:43:39,290
I have not seen that.
Marine Greece.

938
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:44,350
Did you reject it?
I think it was one of those things you 

939
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:44,350
kind of went by and then all my friends 
were like,

940
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:44,350
oh,
we,

941
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:45,380
you know,
green screen,

942
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:46,490
and I'm like,
you know what?

943
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:51,630
I've decided I'm never going to see that
decision.

944
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:53,800
The,
the doors movie in Greece.

945
00:43:53,850 --> 00:43:54,500
Oh,
the doors.

946
00:43:54,501 --> 00:43:56,810
Maybe movies.
The season finale of lost was mine.

947
00:43:57,080 --> 00:44:00,250
I said,
you haven't seen that one thing and then

948
00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:03,110
up to like the season finale,
he decided not to,

949
00:44:03,111 --> 00:44:04,690
so he doesn't know.
Why's,

950
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:10,110
why's he got me enough?
You made it hit me with enough nonsense 

951
00:44:10,110 --> 00:44:10,110
books.
Yeah.

952
00:44:10,110 --> 00:44:14,510
You were a wise man.
What did you just bring up as an 

953
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:14,510
example?
What was the other one?

954
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:15,950
Doors,
doors moving.

955
00:44:15,951 --> 00:44:17,390
I don't know,
just one of those things.

956
00:44:17,391 --> 00:44:22,391
I just all of a sudden just didn't watch
it right before val camera went to New 

957
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:23,310
Mexico and grew his head.

958
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:30,110
He became Jim Morrison for a little bit 
and his head apparently like on the set,

959
00:44:30,111 --> 00:44:32,490
he was like,
so that he was like,

960
00:44:32,491 --> 00:44:37,491
you know,
being Jim Morrison and did a great job 

961
00:44:37,491 --> 00:44:37,680
of Jim Morrison thing.
John Malcovich,

962
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:41,250
the John Malcolm x play,
Jim and the words of a Marlin Brando.

963
00:44:41,251 --> 00:44:45,810
Why don't you just try acting?
Yeah,

964
00:44:45,811 --> 00:44:50,811
that's A.
I love that he said that the whole idea 

965
00:44:50,811 --> 00:44:54,501
of people talking and character.
I read once that Angelina Jolie and Jon 

966
00:44:54,571 --> 00:44:59,310
voight used to get on the phone and they
would have full conversations father and

967
00:44:59,311 --> 00:45:02,580
daughter in character.
And I was like,

968
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:04,300
that's a crazy bitch.
Okay.

969
00:45:04,301 --> 00:45:05,970
And she's broken.
He's broken.

970
00:45:05,971 --> 00:45:08,930
He fucked up raising her.
She's a mess now.

971
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:12,110
I was talking to a friend of mine like 
a.

972
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:17,160
We were somehow Jennifer Aniston came up
and we kind of segwayed from Brad Pitt 

973
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,050
off into Angelina Jolie and we both were
like,

974
00:45:19,051 --> 00:45:20,250
we kind of paused for my one.

975
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:22,440
Fuck Dude.
How crazy is that?

976
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:27,470
How,
how like Brad just got to be kind of 

977
00:45:27,470 --> 00:45:27,470
sitting there like,
just kind of going.

978
00:45:27,470 --> 00:45:31,200
It's just for the press because this 
just like you say that,

979
00:45:31,201 --> 00:45:34,350
but I bet chief,
fuck the shit out of him.

980
00:45:34,351 --> 00:45:37,160
I bet she sent him for a,
uh,

981
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:42,460
in a,
in a sexual ride that Jennifer Aniston 

982
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:44,460
is completely incapable of.
I bet she's way too self control,

983
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:49,130
self conscious to controlled too,
you know,

984
00:45:49,170 --> 00:45:53,660
too reserved.
Angelina Jolie had billy Bob tattooed on

985
00:45:53,661 --> 00:45:56,940
her fucking arm.
She fucked billy Bob Thornton,

986
00:45:57,180 --> 00:46:02,180
tattooed his name on her arm and then 
carried his blood in a vial around her 

987
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:05,400
neck that bitches loked out to Jo.
Lee's got some big old.

988
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,160
Hold that up.
Pull that video up.

989
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:10,470
You remember?
That was a fucking great.

990
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:12,110
That was a great science.
That's just.

991
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:15,630
And I think for some reason maybe I 
Lindsay Lohan.

992
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:20,690
I don't care.
I don't care what kind of bell rope she 

993
00:46:20,690 --> 00:46:20,690
tugs.
I just,

994
00:46:20,690 --> 00:46:21,660
I think the crazy just completely 
outweighs any of that.

995
00:46:21,661 --> 00:46:26,661
Just the drama that's attached to any of
that stuff I think is just like not a 

996
00:46:26,661 --> 00:46:29,230
part of my world.
My friend Tony always said it best.

997
00:46:29,350 --> 00:46:34,350
He said psychotic and erotic are next 
door neighbors and they really.

998
00:46:34,711 --> 00:46:36,900
They're so close to each other.
I could see that.

999
00:46:36,901 --> 00:46:41,570
And the craziest girls I've seen,
the craziest girl I've ever dated was.

1000
00:46:42,990 --> 00:46:44,910
This is Lindsay Lohan,

1001
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:50,160
some big ass tin cups,
cups.

1002
00:46:50,910 --> 00:46:55,910
I'm trying to get in your ass Nigga.
Sweating.

1003
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:04,520
Pennies can day.
This is a different song now this is 

1004
00:47:16,830 --> 00:47:20,570
just remember the chorus which got some 
big ass.

1005
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:25,600
Today's it goes into it.
I need to see them.

1006
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:33,980
Do you see this is a different version 
of man.

1007
00:47:39,071 --> 00:47:43,750
I'm telling you this

1008
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:47,820
different version because the other one 
was more sing silent.

1009
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:51,030
Angelina's Xiao Li gas on a big ass 
titties.

1010
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:56,260
It was like more rhythmic.
I think these guys bit them big problem 

1011
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:58,560
in the rap community from,
in the comedy community,

1012
00:47:58,830 --> 00:48:00,810
which brings me back to bill Hicks at.
Uh,

1013
00:48:00,811 --> 00:48:01,680
I didn't,
uh,

1014
00:48:01,681 --> 00:48:06,681
I was a big,
huge fan of Denis leary for about six 

1015
00:48:06,681 --> 00:48:06,870
months until I saw Hicks and then I 
went,

1016
00:48:06,871 --> 00:48:08,820
what the fuck?
You guys doing the same jokes?

1017
00:48:08,850 --> 00:48:09,000
Right?

1018
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:09,950
But,
and,

1019
00:48:10,010 --> 00:48:12,230
and uh,
and no disrespect to bill,

1020
00:48:12,290 --> 00:48:16,520
but I think as you've probably seen 
mostly in that comedy world,

1021
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:17,510
uh,
the,

1022
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:20,480
the beauty of Hicks was that,
that was his world.

1023
00:48:20,481 --> 00:48:22,110
He was staying in that world.
This is,

1024
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:24,140
this is his whole purpose is to do this 
thing,

1025
00:48:24,330 --> 00:48:26,410
right?
Most people during their,

1026
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:28,640
during that period of time where there 
were,

1027
00:48:28,670 --> 00:48:33,670
there had,
it's like animals had their eye on the 

1028
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:33,670
Johnny Carson Position,
Oh yeah,

1029
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:38,470
do this and then you do this and you get
to show and then you did this thing and 

1030
00:48:38,470 --> 00:48:38,470
you get to be Johnny Carson,
somebody kind of like,

1031
00:48:38,470 --> 00:48:43,061
uh,
the subject of a shakes the clown and 

1032
00:48:43,061 --> 00:48:43,061
like watching everybody tried to be,
you know,

1033
00:48:43,230 --> 00:48:44,460
you know,
being,

1034
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:49,560
you know,
binkies trying to get that position and 

1035
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:51,780
our shakes and all that and you know,
but I feel like Larry was,

1036
00:48:53,810 --> 00:48:58,810
you know,
whatever you want to lay on him as far 

1037
00:48:58,810 --> 00:48:58,810
as like,
you know,

1038
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:01,310
biting that style.
It doesn't matter because as it went on,

1039
00:49:01,311 --> 00:49:04,160
what he ended up doing with all of that,
he ended up becoming.

1040
00:49:04,161 --> 00:49:06,710
He making his own thing.
So even though it kind of,

1041
00:49:06,711 --> 00:49:11,711
maybe you know,
it clearly just clearly carbon copied 

1042
00:49:11,711 --> 00:49:13,970
that.
But in his defense I feel like,

1043
00:49:13,990 --> 00:49:17,090
you know,
back then it was war,

1044
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:22,140
you know,
you're trying to make your make your 

1045
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:22,140
way.
And I think,

1046
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:22,140
Eh,
I don't give that.

1047
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:22,640
I don't give him that.
It was really,

1048
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:24,880
he could have,
he could have come up with his own shit.

1049
00:49:24,910 --> 00:49:25,630
Yeah.
But I think,

1050
00:49:25,690 --> 00:49:30,690
you know,
I had the same problem with them for 

1051
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:30,690
many years,
but like,

1052
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:30,940
just let it go.
I let it go because he's funny.

1053
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:34,420
Yeah.
Some of those watching the rescue me,

1054
00:49:34,421 --> 00:49:36,370
there's some,
there's some tasty bits in that.

1055
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:39,640
In his movie he did A.
Oh man.

1056
00:49:40,690 --> 00:49:43,330
Where he was a burglar and he's stuck in
this house.

1057
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,220
John Lovitz in him.
Is that what it was?

1058
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:48,700
No Man.
He could eat shit and spiderman then.

1059
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:54,460
Did you know he wasn't.
He wasn't in spite of the suck and 

1060
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:54,460
Spiderman is just stupid.
Why is he in that movie?

1061
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:59,570
Someone needs a dad.
Like you couldn't just get anybody else.

1062
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:01,890
I'm not a fan when I find out you're 
full of shit.

1063
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:03,570
I'm sorry.
Right?

1064
00:50:03,571 --> 00:50:04,920
Yeah.
I can appreciate that.

1065
00:50:04,921 --> 00:50:09,921
He does well at some things,
but until he comes clean about being 

1066
00:50:09,921 --> 00:50:12,861
full of shit in the first place,
he can go fuck himself and it's not 

1067
00:50:12,861 --> 00:50:12,861
interesting.

1068
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:13,890
Yeah.
Not Interested.

1069
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,200
I'm going to get him and Bill Murray in 
the same room in a minute.

1070
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:20,840
Do some correct.
Is Two guys want to know where the three

1071
00:50:20,841 --> 00:50:22,760
guys were,
know where they were when they died.

1072
00:50:22,790 --> 00:50:23,540
Rich,
Jenny,

1073
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:27,110
because it was just so crazy.
The Camille committed suicide,

1074
00:50:27,470 --> 00:50:30,380
a Kennison because he was my first 
influence.

1075
00:50:30,381 --> 00:50:33,740
And then Hicks.
I was at this club in Connecticut,

1076
00:50:33,741 --> 00:50:35,680
Hartford,
Connecticut and me and this other comic.

1077
00:50:35,681 --> 00:50:38,090
We're in the green room and this girl 
came in and goes,

1078
00:50:38,091 --> 00:50:39,050
Bill Hicks just died.

1079
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:40,880
We're like,
whoa.

1080
00:50:41,030 --> 00:50:41,980
He may die.
He bit.

1081
00:50:41,990 --> 00:50:44,570
Yeah,
it was like overnight and I was in.

1082
00:50:44,930 --> 00:50:49,930
I was in a hotel in Detroit or flying to
Europe the next morning and uh,

1083
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:56,260
I woke up in the middle of the night,
like just bolt upright at whatever time 

1084
00:50:57,351 --> 00:50:58,870
that was.
I can remember at the time was.

1085
00:50:58,871 --> 00:51:03,871
But like I basically was awake and then 
we got up the next morning and my pager 

1086
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:09,160
beeper got a message from Dunkin is 
manager and it was like bill pass last 

1087
00:51:09,710 --> 00:51:14,710
night.
And the time that was quoted he passed 

1088
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:16,190
was when I woke up in bed and was pretty
creepy.

1089
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:21,790
Your stomach actually via wherever he 
was,

1090
00:51:21,791 --> 00:51:23,710
through Detroit to tap me on his way.
I was like,

1091
00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:25,540
dude,
I'm sorry to make you go to Detroit.

1092
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:30,490
It's probably a really quick trip when 
you're in hyperspace.

1093
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:36,040
It's probably right next door.
He reached over and press found out 

1094
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:36,040
about his.

1095
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:39,110
I found out about his problem because I 
had an awful nightmare when we were.

1096
00:51:39,150 --> 00:51:44,150
I was at a one of those kinds of motels 
where you get the you can pull your car 

1097
00:51:44,150 --> 00:51:47,791
right up to the outside and it was kind 
of like the two stories and you kind of 

1098
00:51:47,791 --> 00:51:47,791
walk through the breezeway between the 
thing.

1099
00:51:47,791 --> 00:51:51,460
He's and there was like a hundred people
there and everybody's bawling their eyes

1100
00:51:51,461 --> 00:51:54,880
out and bill wasn't there and I was 
like,

1101
00:51:54,890 --> 00:51:57,340
what the fuck is this dream about?
So I called the.

1102
00:51:57,430 --> 00:52:00,190
I called his manager the next day and 
I'm like,

1103
00:52:00,490 --> 00:52:04,030
I had this fucked up dream about bill.
And he goes,

1104
00:52:04,930 --> 00:52:06,580
yeah,
I can't really talk about it.

1105
00:52:07,910 --> 00:52:12,910
And nobody,
because nobody knew yet that he had 

1106
00:52:12,910 --> 00:52:14,581
pancreatic cancer.
I had this fucked up dream and I called 

1107
00:52:14,581 --> 00:52:14,581
his manager and went,
what the.

1108
00:52:14,581 --> 00:52:16,450
I had this weird dream about bill,
what's up?

1109
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,670
And he's like,
yeah,

1110
00:52:18,671 --> 00:52:21,110
I can't really talk about it.
We're,

1111
00:52:21,410 --> 00:52:25,760
do you believe mean there's no way that 
was coincidental?

1112
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:26,870
No.
No Way.

1113
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:27,770
No,
no way.

1114
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:29,840
What is that?
What's going on there?

1115
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:30,860
Yeah.
Is there a zero,

1116
00:52:30,890 --> 00:52:35,890
zero,
zero dimension that is next door 

1117
00:52:35,890 --> 00:52:36,830
neighbor that you can tap into that I 
have no idea.

1118
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:41,840
Edix.
Diarrhetics what the fuck is that?

1119
00:52:42,861 --> 00:52:43,310
Yeah.
I don't know,

1120
00:52:43,311 --> 00:52:44,270
but it was,
it was pretty

1121
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:47,230
and I had a couple moments like that 
with him over that time.

1122
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:48,220
That's what I'm saying.
Like when he died,

1123
00:52:48,221 --> 00:52:49,120
like I was just,
you know.

1124
00:52:49,330 --> 00:52:50,620
Yeah,
of course they woke up in the middle.

1125
00:52:50,730 --> 00:52:55,730
I never,
I've never had anything like that 

1126
00:52:55,730 --> 00:52:55,730
happened to me,
but I absolutely believe it's possible.

1127
00:52:55,730 --> 00:52:55,730
Well,
yeah,

1128
00:52:56,110 --> 00:52:57,610
it was a weird.
It was a weird time.

1129
00:52:57,990 --> 00:53:02,990
They see the most provable form of any 
sort of psychic phenomenon is the 

1130
00:53:02,990 --> 00:53:03,420
ability to know when someone's looking 
at you,

1131
00:53:03,630 --> 00:53:05,550
they said that statistically you can 
prove,

1132
00:53:05,930 --> 00:53:09,180
you know,
you can have people stand and have their

1133
00:53:09,181 --> 00:53:13,950
back facing a group of people and they 
can statistically tell with,

1134
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:15,550
you know,
certain amount of uncertainty,

1135
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:20,600
guesswork,
but you could show on a graph that 

1136
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:20,600
people can tell when people are looking 
at them,

1137
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:23,460
if that,
if that is possible,

1138
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:26,010
valid than these other things.
Definitely on some

1139
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:28,320
level valid because it's energy.

1140
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:31,600
Have you ever heard of the work of 
Rupert Sheldrake?

1141
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:35,390
He's this guy who believes in the 
morphogenetic field and he's,

1142
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:39,370
he's done research showing that dogs can
tell when their owners are coming home.

1143
00:53:39,730 --> 00:53:44,730
He believes there is some sort of a 
frequency that we're all tuning into 

1144
00:53:44,730 --> 00:53:48,781
that all of our consciousness connected 
to some type of grid and you can 

1145
00:53:48,781 --> 00:53:52,240
recognize when that's in motion and you 
can recognize things and events,

1146
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:55,420
things that are happening and it,
it's just a matter of us being sensitive

1147
00:53:55,421 --> 00:53:57,370
enough to tune it in,
you know?

1148
00:53:57,371 --> 00:53:58,100
And that's,
um,

1149
00:53:59,230 --> 00:54:04,230
I think that's really one of the 
weirdest things about being a human 

1150
00:54:04,230 --> 00:54:04,540
being.
I'm like,

1151
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:05,920
no,
no,

1152
00:54:05,921 --> 00:54:06,970
no.
He's not doing that.

1153
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:09,130
I don't think he is.
He might be.

1154
00:54:09,131 --> 00:54:10,960
I doubt if he does,
he'll be okay.

1155
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:12,730
He's just a mess.
He's from Ohio,

1156
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:15,160
you know,
I rescued him from Columbus.

1157
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:18,190
Um,
I,

1158
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:23,640
I want to believe that we're slowly but 
surely moving from the phase of grunts 

1159
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:27,850
to language to written language to 
internet,

1160
00:54:27,851 --> 00:54:30,580
to psychic ability to communication.
I mean,

1161
00:54:30,790 --> 00:54:34,060
I want to think that it's.
But there's so much room for fuckery.

1162
00:54:34,061 --> 00:54:36,410
There's so much room for fake psychics.
Oh yeah.

1163
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:38,250
So when I hear a story like yours,
like,

1164
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:39,580
ah Ha,

1165
00:54:41,810 --> 00:54:46,810
I have no reason to lie about that.
It's not like it's going to make or 

1166
00:54:46,810 --> 00:54:46,810
break my career,
you know?

1167
00:54:46,810 --> 00:54:48,780
So what does sound cool?
It sounds pretty cool.

1168
00:54:48,810 --> 00:54:51,540
Pretty bitchy to bring up at a party,
especially if you're in front of a fire.

1169
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:52,110
Touch me.

1170
00:54:54,330 --> 00:54:59,330
Yeah.
Everybody wants to fucking claim 

1171
00:54:59,330 --> 00:54:59,330
psychic.
Everybody wants to claim it.

1172
00:54:59,330 --> 00:54:59,830
It's so hard.

1173
00:54:59,890 --> 00:55:01,420
Trust people,
I don't take no shit.

1174
00:55:01,430 --> 00:55:02,280
That's,
I think,

1175
00:55:02,290 --> 00:55:07,290
the,
the problem with all of that is that 

1176
00:55:07,290 --> 00:55:07,290
we're not probably on some,
you know,

1177
00:55:07,290 --> 00:55:11,540
a universal level.
We're not really allowed to completely 

1178
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:14,551
be able to tap in and rely on it.
Although I do firmly believed that each 

1179
00:55:14,551 --> 00:55:16,930
one of us has to kind of really 
listening to the,

1180
00:55:16,931 --> 00:55:21,931
uh,
the intuitive side of ourselves to kind 

1181
00:55:21,931 --> 00:55:24,901
of just follow your heart and know what 
path you're supposed to choose because 

1182
00:55:24,901 --> 00:55:27,580
we all kind of have a role to play at 
second and you kind of have to find that

1183
00:55:27,581 --> 00:55:32,581
happy medium between like making 
yourself happy and making sure you're 

1184
00:55:32,581 --> 00:55:33,400
fulfill,
but also kind of doing,

1185
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:35,170
doing your part,
you know,

1186
00:55:35,330 --> 00:55:35,910
they,
they work.

1187
00:55:35,990 --> 00:55:40,990
The intuitive is such an interesting 
point because your intuition depends on 

1188
00:55:43,431 --> 00:55:46,310
your respect for your consciousness.
Respend.

1189
00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:51,470
It depends on your respect for your 
honesty about your own actions and your 

1190
00:55:51,470 --> 00:55:55,061
own thoughts and your own ideas.
And I find that when I am the most at 

1191
00:55:55,061 --> 00:55:58,130
peace with my own actions,
then I am a much,

1192
00:55:58,131 --> 00:56:00,860
a much better in tune with other people.
And I've,

1193
00:56:00,861 --> 00:56:02,880
I've met people that were completely 
full of shit.

1194
00:56:02,881 --> 00:56:07,881
And like,
how does this guy not know that he's 

1195
00:56:07,881 --> 00:56:10,241
full of Shit,
not know that no one's going to buy 

1196
00:56:10,241 --> 00:56:10,241
this.
I'll tell you how,

1197
00:56:10,241 --> 00:56:10,900
because he's lying to himself because 
he's lying.

1198
00:56:10,910 --> 00:56:11,390
He's lying

1199
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:17,520
in a way.
Positive reinforcement for his negative 

1200
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:17,520
actions.
If he keeps winning,

1201
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:18,400
yes.
Even if it's negative,

1202
00:56:19,210 --> 00:56:21,640
that's just going to reinforce that and 
reinforce that big

1203
00:56:21,930 --> 00:56:26,930
when I'm most honest myself is when I'm 
get the most intuitive reads off of 

1204
00:56:27,101 --> 00:56:28,750
people.
I had one friend,

1205
00:56:28,751 --> 00:56:31,930
my friend,
Brian Cowen and I used to,

1206
00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:37,590
he was like the worst guy for like being
involved with friends that would turn 

1207
00:56:37,661 --> 00:56:41,830
out to be crazy and idiots and thieves 
and nuts and worst,

1208
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:43,210
the worst,
uh,

1209
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:45,730
connections with girls.
And I would always,

1210
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,600
I was like a big brother.
Me.

1211
00:56:49,270 --> 00:56:53,170
He's worried about you doing coke,
doing coke.

1212
00:56:53,350 --> 00:56:55,390
What's in your hand?
Oh,

1213
00:56:55,391 --> 00:56:56,850
bud light.
No.

1214
00:56:58,130 --> 00:56:59,770
Oh,
it is powerful.

1215
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:02,050
Yeah.
If you wanted to come down tonight,

1216
00:57:02,290 --> 00:57:04,000
who knows?
Maybe some of them won't show up.

1217
00:57:04,030 --> 00:57:05,710
But uh,
it's mad flavor.

1218
00:57:05,711 --> 00:57:10,090
Aka Joey Diaz.
Brian redband demand to my left.

1219
00:57:10,210 --> 00:57:11,590
Uh,
Josh mcdermitt,

1220
00:57:11,591 --> 00:57:15,550
our good friend from that show,
30 and fucked in the ass or whatever.

1221
00:57:16,090 --> 00:57:17,950
And me and a 10:30
here.

1222
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:18,820
ICEHOUSE.
Fascinating.

1223
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:22,010
Did you ever experience or experiment 
with any drugs?

1224
00:57:22,011 --> 00:57:23,930
Did you ever do like mushrooms or 
anything growing up?

1225
00:57:23,930 --> 00:57:25,250
Do you know?
This is on the Internet.

1226
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:30,350
People can hear this to be careful what 
you said.

1227
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:30,630
I'm just

1228
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:35,360
Jesus Christ.
I'm like,

1229
00:57:35,361 --> 00:57:37,490
Oh wait,
I'm not supposed to talk about something

1230
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:43,720
you looked at me like what?
I mean I just slit your chair on far 

1231
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:47,620
younger when I was like [inaudible] 93,
I went to Lollapalooza and I was really 

1232
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:50,240
a hippie kind of back there.
And then in a tool was one of the.

1233
00:57:51,010 --> 00:57:53,030
Because I used to be at nine snail fan 
growing up.

1234
00:57:53,031 --> 00:57:55,880
Then it became some hippie and I never 
remember seeing tool and going like,

1235
00:57:55,881 --> 00:58:00,881
why am I not so 1992?
I'm moving on [inaudible] 93 of them,

1236
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:05,390
but a lot.
I always wondered that because I mean,

1237
00:58:05,391 --> 00:58:06,610
especially a year old,
uh,

1238
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:08,940
old videos sober,
uh,

1239
00:58:09,030 --> 00:58:14,030
you know,
just the visuals on that was just 

1240
00:58:14,030 --> 00:58:14,030
amazing when you're on mushrooms.
But,

1241
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:19,180
uh,
did you ever play with any of that kind 

1242
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:19,180
of psychedelic stuff or never,
never,

1243
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:24,200
never do.
What was the song that you did to the 

1244
00:58:25,681 --> 00:58:29,010
FIBONACCI sequence and now you're on 
drugs?

1245
00:58:29,050 --> 00:58:29,550
He's,
he's,

1246
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:31,560
he's,
he's beautiful.

1247
00:58:31,730 --> 00:58:32,910
It was beautiful.
And what he is,

1248
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:35,100
you can't fake a Brian.
I mean,

1249
00:58:35,101 --> 00:58:36,720
he is just that,
that's who he is.

1250
00:58:37,630 --> 00:58:38,260
Yeah.
There's no,

1251
00:58:38,270 --> 00:58:41,100
it was a song that you did to the 
FIBONACCI sequence.

1252
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:43,620
Um,
uh,

1253
00:58:43,621 --> 00:58:47,050
I believe it was foggy mountain 
breakdown really?

1254
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:47,640
No,
no,

1255
00:58:48,750 --> 00:58:50,610
it was one of those songs,
one of those songs.

1256
00:58:50,611 --> 00:58:51,840
Yeah,
whatever it is,

1257
00:58:51,841 --> 00:58:53,310
you can find it online,
Google it.

1258
00:58:53,490 --> 00:58:55,280
But um,
the,

1259
00:58:55,430 --> 00:58:56,760
the,
the FIBONACCI sequence,

1260
00:58:56,761 --> 00:59:01,761
I watched a documentary about it once 
where they showed pine cones and 

1261
00:59:01,761 --> 00:59:05,720
pineapples and sunflowers and all these 
different things show that there's some 

1262
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:10,401
sort,
some sort of a mathematical code to 

1263
00:59:10,401 --> 00:59:10,401
nature.
Right.

1264
00:59:10,401 --> 00:59:14,180
And I,
and I think the funny thing is like 

1265
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:14,180
people

1266
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:15,130
myself actually trying to like force 
those numbers on a song.

1267
00:59:15,131 --> 00:59:16,450
It's kind of,
it's kind of funny.

1268
00:59:16,451 --> 00:59:20,710
It's kind of clunky because the song is 
that any song is that,

1269
00:59:20,711 --> 00:59:21,800
so,
you know,

1270
00:59:21,801 --> 00:59:22,040
to Kinda

1271
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:24,610
like,
it's like,

1272
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:25,850
it's like,
you know,

1273
00:59:26,150 --> 00:59:28,300
my kid blocks like,
Ooh,

1274
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:29,840
look through square.
And they stack,

1275
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:31,370
um,
the uh,

1276
00:59:31,430 --> 00:59:33,170
every,
everything is that.

1277
00:59:33,171 --> 00:59:35,860
So it like actually like write your 
faces,

1278
00:59:36,230 --> 00:59:39,920
force that into a song is a,
as a little a sophomore.

1279
00:59:40,190 --> 00:59:45,190
So I'm,
I'm reprimanding myself for being a 

1280
00:59:45,190 --> 00:59:45,190
little silly.
Oh,

1281
00:59:45,190 --> 00:59:45,190
you're not,
you will.

1282
00:59:45,190 --> 00:59:47,870
I thought it was an homage to the,
uh,

1283
00:59:47,871 --> 00:59:49,220
the,
the order of the universe.

1284
00:59:49,221 --> 00:59:51,500
I didn't think there was silly at all,
but that's as a fan.

1285
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:53,400
I enjoyed it,
but I,

1286
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:55,250
it was just short for fanatic and I have
to go now.

1287
00:59:55,940 --> 01:00:00,940
That's why you know,
you look at someone with a nose job and 

1288
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:00,940
you go,
what the fuck is going on here?

1289
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:03,380
Some of these ruined the sequence.
You've ruined the FIBONACCI sequence.

1290
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:06,680
Now you gotta make you gotTa.
Make Lemons into lemonade.

1291
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:09,110
You gotTa,
you gotta make soup out of the Ham hocks

1292
01:00:09,111 --> 01:00:10,250
and the beans that you've been given.

1293
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:13,160
It's just,
just is what it is.

1294
01:00:13,410 --> 01:00:14,720
When,
when,

1295
01:00:15,190 --> 01:00:20,190
when you really find out that there 
truly is a mathematical sequence that 

1296
01:00:20,991 --> 01:00:25,991
the whole universe is based on it,
it's one of those things that really 

1297
01:00:25,991 --> 01:00:27,590
makes you step back and go,
we are,

1298
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:32,920
man,
we might as well be fucking cave men 

1299
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:32,960
because even though we like to think 
that with our four g connections and our

1300
01:00:32,961 --> 01:00:37,961
satellite dishes in our cars that we 
somehow or another have elevated from 

1301
01:00:37,961 --> 01:00:39,020
the biological.
Like Bob was,

1302
01:00:39,021 --> 01:00:44,021
so it was still so base.
We're still so stuck in the Rut of the 

1303
01:00:44,021 --> 01:00:45,290
mud and you know,
we,

1304
01:00:45,340 --> 01:00:46,710
we don't.
We really,

1305
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:51,720
really have barely wrapped our heads 
around how complicated and insane and 

1306
01:00:51,861 --> 01:00:55,490
diverse this whole thing really is.
The FIBONACCI sequence.

1307
01:00:55,491 --> 01:00:57,190
To me,
it's like one of those real,

1308
01:00:57,230 --> 01:01:02,230
real mindfox.
It makes you just pause and there was a 

1309
01:01:02,230 --> 01:01:06,460
particle physicist recently or 
theoretical physicist that was talking 

1310
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:09,701
about when they study quantum mechanics,
they find that there's some sort of an 

1311
01:01:10,431 --> 01:01:12,470
embedded code to it all.

1312
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:16,970
That it's not just an embedded code.
It's a recognizable code that is used in

1313
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,500
mathematicians and they said,
look,

1314
01:01:18,630 --> 01:01:22,160
fucking the whole universe is a program.
It gets a program,

1315
01:01:22,310 --> 01:01:23,420
you know,
whether you call it,

1316
01:01:23,690 --> 01:01:28,690
whether it's a biological program or 
whether there's intelligent design has 

1317
01:01:28,690 --> 01:01:31,070
been done by some engineer from pro 
beefiest movie,

1318
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:33,320
whatever it is.
There's a program to this.

1319
01:01:34,930 --> 01:01:39,930
I was always playing around with just a 
story where you actually day on the way 

1320
01:01:39,930 --> 01:01:44,531
to time travel would be to somehow 
connect into the base of your DNA and 

1321
01:01:44,531 --> 01:01:48,301
there's actually a time code in the DNA 
and you have to like reset it so that 

1322
01:01:48,301 --> 01:01:51,350
all of a sudden you just end up in this 
other time zone,

1323
01:01:51,380 --> 01:01:53,810
but then you would.
Your software wouldn't be compatible,

1324
01:01:53,811 --> 01:01:55,970
so this whole script fell apart just 
before my eyes.

1325
01:01:57,980 --> 01:02:02,980
Imagine if you did decide you were going
to go into another dimension and you go 

1326
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:06,551
into the the other dementia,
you would just be engulfed in complete 

1327
01:02:06,551 --> 01:02:08,780
madness because you don't have the tools
to deal with that new.

1328
01:02:08,950 --> 01:02:11,570
Right?
That's like that.

1329
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:16,680
Like you go to,
you're going to hit enter and you're 

1330
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:16,680
like,
oh,

1331
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:19,331
I forgot a zero.
Just fucking kaleidoscope

1332
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:25,400
until the end of time.
It's like that movie or the twilight 

1333
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:27,270
zone episode.
When was at Burgess,

1334
01:02:27,271 --> 01:02:32,271
meredith was all just all he wanted to 
do was read and just leave me alone 

1335
01:02:32,271 --> 01:02:36,621
leave and he's in inside of a library 
and a nuclear explosion happens and 

1336
01:02:36,621 --> 01:02:40,821
everyone's dead,
but he's surrounded by all these books 

1337
01:02:40,821 --> 01:02:40,821
and then he breaks his glasses.
He's like,

1338
01:02:40,821 --> 01:02:42,540
oh,
fuck it.

1339
01:02:42,541 --> 01:02:47,541
Just forever in this downward spiral of 
inability to perceive his environment.

1340
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:52,860
I'm worried about him.
He's all right.

1341
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:55,470
I was worried about him for the first 
five years.

1342
01:02:55,471 --> 01:02:57,270
I knew it.
When we got into,

1343
01:02:58,860 --> 01:03:03,860
we got into a groove and I know he knows
exactly what he's doing.

1344
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:06,300
That's the only way to kill the hanging 
over.

1345
01:03:06,450 --> 01:03:08,640
You just start.
When he starts slurring,

1346
01:03:08,641 --> 01:03:10,160
you're going to get nervous,
but it's.

1347
01:03:10,570 --> 01:03:12,500
He's okay.
Yeah.

1348
01:03:12,730 --> 01:03:13,950
He's always looking at you,
man.

1349
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:16,830
He's got monitors too,
so even when he's not looking at you,

1350
01:03:16,831 --> 01:03:21,831
he's looking at you through monitors and
what you really need to think about is 

1351
01:03:21,831 --> 01:03:24,090
the fact that out over a sold out show 
tonight at the thing.

1352
01:03:24,180 --> 01:03:24,870
Yeah,
the Ice House.

1353
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:26,400
The ice.
He'll be up there.

1354
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:29,110
He's a comedian.
He's got some funny jokes.

1355
01:03:30,930 --> 01:03:33,120
You should come tonight.
I'm working.

1356
01:03:35,940 --> 01:03:38,370
Yeah,
you should let people invite themselves.

1357
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:43,840
That way you don't get rejected now.
I'm actually pouring wine tonight at 

1358
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:44,760
the.
Oh you.

1359
01:03:44,761 --> 01:03:46,380
If people want to go see,
where is it at?

1360
01:03:46,490 --> 01:03:48,330
It's a every Royce.
It's an old,

1361
01:03:48,690 --> 01:03:53,690
old Pasadena down the street here.
I've heard crazy stories about you with 

1362
01:03:53,690 --> 01:03:56,010
these at signings A.
I've heard shows.

1363
01:03:56,011 --> 01:04:01,011
There's shows,
shows that you've done when you tone 

1364
01:04:01,011 --> 01:04:01,110
your entire back to the audience during 
the entire performance.

1365
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:06,440
Have you done that?
Have really an awful sensitivity to a 

1366
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:08,190
flash.
A flash.

1367
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:10,230
Cameras flashing.
So if I,

1368
01:04:10,231 --> 01:04:11,550
if the,
if you just can't,

1369
01:04:11,980 --> 01:04:13,830
people can't control themselves.
I just have to.

1370
01:04:13,910 --> 01:04:18,910
I can't,
I can't focus on what I'm doing because 

1371
01:04:18,910 --> 01:04:21,801
I'll actually go into a convulsion.
So I have really had to take an 

1372
01:04:21,801 --> 01:04:23,040
epileptic convulsion.
I can't finish the set.

1373
01:04:23,070 --> 01:04:25,290
So I'm sorry I have to turn my fucking 
back to you.

1374
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:28,140
I didn't know that was even real to my 
friend.

1375
01:04:28,141 --> 01:04:33,141
Jim's wife is epileptic and my message 
board would have these avatars that 

1376
01:04:33,141 --> 01:04:35,580
would fly and that's basically nobody's 
business.

1377
01:04:35,581 --> 01:04:36,470
So it's like,
you know,

1378
01:04:37,330 --> 01:04:42,330
I,
I asked you to fucking put the camera 

1379
01:04:42,330 --> 01:04:43,380
away to maybe if you told them fucking 
seizure me,

1380
01:04:43,381 --> 01:04:48,381
mom,
they get right up in your face because 

1381
01:04:48,381 --> 01:04:50,390
then you got the asshole who was a who 
still into nine inch nails from 92 and 

1382
01:04:50,390 --> 01:04:51,060
he's going to do the flash thing because
he hates me.

1383
01:04:51,660 --> 01:04:53,970
He hates you for leaving them.
So you buddy.

1384
01:04:53,971 --> 01:04:56,790
It's abandonment issues is pointed at 
you when he said that,

1385
01:04:57,090 --> 01:04:57,760
do you,
do you,

1386
01:04:57,900 --> 01:05:00,270
do you know Trent?
Do you do work with them ever?

1387
01:05:00,610 --> 01:05:03,300
I,
we've met several times,

1388
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:07,440
probably more than more than several,
but I haven't talked to him.

1389
01:05:07,650 --> 01:05:10,590
He grew his neck with val kilmer.
Grew his head.

1390
01:05:11,610 --> 01:05:14,110
I haven't,
I haven't seen him for awhile as it is.

1391
01:05:15,310 --> 01:05:18,040
He's huge.
He started bodybuilding,

1392
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:18,730
I think.
Yeah,

1393
01:05:18,731 --> 01:05:19,660
I think yeah,
that was.

1394
01:05:19,661 --> 01:05:22,630
I think he did start lifting,
but I don't know.

1395
01:05:22,631 --> 01:05:24,730
It's a weird thing for a musician,
right?

1396
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:29,800
It's like a one point in time musicians.
We're always sort of one of my favorite 

1397
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,600
fucking scenes.
I almost forgot this is you,

1398
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:33,430
uh,
some guy jumped on stage,

1399
01:05:33,460 --> 01:05:38,460
you hip toss them and they took his back
and continue to look at him like he was 

1400
01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:39,090
ready for it.
I got it.

1401
01:05:39,130 --> 01:05:40,600
Yeah.
Got It right there.

1402
01:05:40,820 --> 01:05:42,190
What,
what was that about?

1403
01:05:42,191 --> 01:05:43,570
What was going on there?
I mean,

1404
01:05:44,050 --> 01:05:46,930
you obviously you didn't hurt him,
so you sensed that he was friendly.

1405
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:49,000
Uh,
yeah,

1406
01:05:49,001 --> 01:05:49,650
it was,
uh,

1407
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:50,620
it was my stage.

1408
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:56,080
Like if you're up there you get choked.
So beautiful.

1409
01:05:56,081 --> 01:06:01,081
You give them links to the arm around 
and when you thought you were like the 

1410
01:06:01,081 --> 01:06:01,081
garden,
do a,

1411
01:06:01,081 --> 01:06:02,540
uh,
like an Faq.

1412
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:07,840
So beautiful.
But the thing is the guy didn't even try

1413
01:06:07,841 --> 01:06:09,700
to fight that art look.
He throws his arms up.

1414
01:06:10,420 --> 01:06:12,430
He was just thinking Dick against his,
his,

1415
01:06:12,450 --> 01:06:13,290
his,
his boats.

1416
01:06:14,140 --> 01:06:14,740
He's like,
ah,

1417
01:06:14,741 --> 01:06:17,200
this is the best.
I'm going to have a baby,

1418
01:06:17,370 --> 01:06:20,620
but I'm a tool base to have a baby.
And he painted blue.

1419
01:06:21,340 --> 01:06:26,340
Pretty rare situation where you got the 
perfect retarded fan and I have a dozen 

1420
01:06:27,191 --> 01:06:32,191
fight hard.
And how cool was it for him though you 

1421
01:06:32,191 --> 01:06:33,260
were singing while you had his back?
Well,

1422
01:06:33,261 --> 01:06:34,440
the,
I think that's a,

1423
01:06:35,050 --> 01:06:36,190
you know,
there's not,

1424
01:06:36,830 --> 01:06:39,550
there was no footage online that can.
It shows me everything that happened.

1425
01:06:39,551 --> 01:06:41,680
We actually had a guest singer come out 
on that song,

1426
01:06:41,681 --> 01:06:46,681
read it right during that.
So like not only the kid like have to 

1427
01:06:46,681 --> 01:06:47,900
deal with,
you know,

1428
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:53,600
me doing that,
but he had to sit through this other 

1429
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:56,041
singer doing a thing to show you.
Just held them back control.

1430
01:06:56,261 --> 01:06:58,230
I had the wrap the cord around his

1431
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:01,710
and continued singing

1432
01:07:03,330 --> 01:07:08,330
[inaudible] that's slack.
So every time he would go and check the 

1433
01:07:08,330 --> 01:07:08,720
thing.
That's so beautiful.

1434
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:10,890
Look at me.
Was He talking to you?

1435
01:07:10,891 --> 01:07:14,680
Well this is going on.
I get my backup to.

1436
01:07:17,370 --> 01:07:17,550
No.

1437
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:23,840
Can I see a little pat on the back end 
is where the security was going to leave

1438
01:07:25,601 --> 01:07:29,020
you alone back then at it.
You'll see there's the guy coming out to

1439
01:07:29,021 --> 01:07:29,620
sing.
It's a,

1440
01:07:29,621 --> 01:07:32,500
it's Haitham.
He's a friend of ours.

1441
01:07:32,501 --> 01:07:36,970
He's going to do resist going on 97,
64,

1442
01:07:37,130 --> 01:07:39,220
64.
Let's see.

1443
01:07:39,690 --> 01:07:42,000
Back when you didn't get sued for Shit,
right?

1444
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:43,840
Yeah.
Because that happened.

1445
01:07:43,841 --> 01:07:45,500
Now you'd be.
You'd be fucked.

1446
01:07:45,690 --> 01:07:47,680
I can't do anything.
Would you not do that now?

1447
01:07:48,660 --> 01:07:52,900
You probably do.
You would just do it anyway.

1448
01:07:53,150 --> 01:07:53,930
Yeah.
I mean,

1449
01:07:54,250 --> 01:07:56,440
I don't know what you're doing.
You'd be crazy.

1450
01:07:56,860 --> 01:07:59,890
You never know.
That guy that killed dimebag Darrell.

1451
01:08:00,150 --> 01:08:02,280
I did it once when I was young.
Rewards words for you,

1452
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:07,360
John Lennon.
I did it once when I was younger at a 

1453
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:10,501
wing concert and now I look back at it.
I cringe just thinking the fact that I 

1454
01:08:10,501 --> 01:08:14,881
fucking got up on stage and they 
actually had to stop there like they 

1455
01:08:14,881 --> 01:08:17,480
were in between songs and then I jumped 
back into the audience,

1456
01:08:17,481 --> 01:08:22,481
but I was like,
it just makes me sick to my stomach and 

1457
01:08:22,481 --> 01:08:24,791
I was like 18 at a wing concert,
but I can't imagine doing that now.

1458
01:08:25,370 --> 01:08:27,230
Who makes you feel any better?
If I was right next year,

1459
01:08:27,231 --> 01:08:27,770
I'd be like,
dude,

1460
01:08:27,830 --> 01:08:32,830
pussy man,
it,

1461
01:08:34,220 --> 01:08:35,240
they'll be fine,
man.

1462
01:08:35,241 --> 01:08:39,010
This happens all the time.
Like some bands like,

1463
01:08:39,020 --> 01:08:40,370
like it,
like I remember mighty,

1464
01:08:40,460 --> 01:08:43,630
mighty bosstones nip slip,
slip,

1465
01:08:44,060 --> 01:08:44,570
mighty,
mighty.

1466
01:08:44,571 --> 01:08:47,060
Bosstones,
you still like almost welcomed people on

1467
01:08:47,061 --> 01:08:48,440
the stage,
if I remember correctly,

1468
01:08:48,441 --> 01:08:50,030
so I think that's why I did.
I was like,

1469
01:08:50,031 --> 01:08:51,410
oh,
all bands are like this,

1470
01:08:51,630 --> 01:08:53,000
you know,
it's a social event.

1471
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:57,350
Yeah.
I'm not trying to like convey a thing.

1472
01:08:57,890 --> 01:09:02,890
Jump on up.
What's up with your music not being on 

1473
01:09:02,890 --> 01:09:05,891
itunes?
Is that something licensings bullshit 

1474
01:09:05,891 --> 01:09:09,240
crap owns.
I'm sorry for asking them questions like

1475
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:12,920
for a perfect circle around it.
Oh,

1476
01:09:12,921 --> 01:09:13,790
they are?
Yeah.

1477
01:09:13,791 --> 01:09:15,680
What the fuck are you talking about son?
Well,

1478
01:09:15,690 --> 01:09:20,690
I,
I recently went through a thing where I 

1479
01:09:20,690 --> 01:09:23,440
sold all my cds,
a lot of my cds and I babbled rebuying 

1480
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:23,440
them on digital,
but yeah,

1481
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:24,410
I know keep them.

1482
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:29,800
I know higher quality.
I know his cd much higher quality a 

1483
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:31,340
while now that they've got.
There's a new version of,

1484
01:09:31,430 --> 01:09:36,430
you know like MP,
MP four a or whatever they are there 

1485
01:09:36,430 --> 01:09:37,220
that are pretty solid.
It's a pretty solid and it all depends.

1486
01:09:38,270 --> 01:09:43,270
It all depends on how you use 
compression because there's ways to do 

1487
01:09:43,270 --> 01:09:43,580
it where the new digital formats are 
actually pretty bad ass.

1488
01:09:43,650 --> 01:09:45,120
Joseph,
as good as CD quality,

1489
01:09:45,780 --> 01:09:47,720
it's pretty.
You would never notice the difference,

1490
01:09:48,020 --> 01:09:53,020
especially when you're listening to it 
on this fucking thing like that 

1491
01:09:53,020 --> 01:09:55,580
Portlandia episode like let's have on 
these little speakers.

1492
01:09:55,940 --> 01:10:00,940
Do you have one of those artists that 
emerged through the digital takeover of,

1493
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,490
of music.
What was that like for you to watch that

1494
01:10:04,491 --> 01:10:07,250
happen where all of a sudden your shit 
was online and you know,

1495
01:10:07,251 --> 01:10:08,300
to go through the,
you know,

1496
01:10:08,340 --> 01:10:11,340
the whole,
the whole scene with a.

1497
01:10:12,130 --> 01:10:14,810
well,
I mean some people just kind of tried to

1498
01:10:14,811 --> 01:10:16,650
fight it and there's other people that 
did know,

1499
01:10:16,780 --> 01:10:19,730
had to do whatever they had to do to,
to kind of embrace it.

1500
01:10:20,130 --> 01:10:25,010
I know there's one thing I know for sure
you cannot download my wine.

1501
01:10:26,850 --> 01:10:29,390
That's right.
Not a digital format.

1502
01:10:29,420 --> 01:10:34,420
Not yet.
Not until we have those printers that 

1503
01:10:34,420 --> 01:10:36,731
can print out your wine show.
Crazy as that sounds retarded.

1504
01:10:37,850 --> 01:10:42,850
Just five years ago.
That sounds more walking around with a 

1505
01:10:42,850 --> 01:10:43,790
phone that's not connected to anything.
That's funny.

1506
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:49,720
Yeah.
Jay Leno has one of these three d 

1507
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:52,451
printers in his shop.
He puts a video online of him making 

1508
01:10:52,451 --> 01:10:52,850
parts for old cars with it.
Yeah.

1509
01:10:53,390 --> 01:10:54,950
It's fucking amazing.
I mean,

1510
01:10:54,951 --> 01:10:57,620
you just run it through a scanner and 
next thing you know it's.

1511
01:10:57,950 --> 01:10:59,650
There it is.
Yeah.

1512
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:02,430
And that's the beginning.
I'm loving this wine now.

1513
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:05,900
I actually,
I actually see that's the problem.

1514
01:11:07,460 --> 01:11:12,460
His problem is it's okay.
It's like at all the problems in the 

1515
01:11:12,460 --> 01:11:12,460
world,
you know.

1516
01:11:12,620 --> 01:11:14,310
When was the last time you were at the 
Olive Garden?

1517
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:17,580
A lot longer.
You motherfucker,

1518
01:11:17,581 --> 01:11:20,250
you did it.
I would have to go there for me to be my

1519
01:11:20,251 --> 01:11:21,300
first time.
Oh,

1520
01:11:21,301 --> 01:11:23,400
you have never been.
I'm not snooty.

1521
01:11:25,100 --> 01:11:27,390
Is it hard to find good restaurants in 
Arizona?

1522
01:11:27,670 --> 01:11:28,770
Yeah.
Yeah.

1523
01:11:28,830 --> 01:11:29,700
Where we are,
there's a,

1524
01:11:29,701 --> 01:11:34,701
there's a,
there's a handful of pretty awesome 

1525
01:11:34,701 --> 01:11:36,381
places,
but there's not as many as we would 

1526
01:11:36,381 --> 01:11:36,381
like.
Uh,

1527
01:11:36,381 --> 01:11:40,040
how far are you away from Phoenix?
Two hours to Tucson worth four hours 

1528
01:11:41,131 --> 01:11:46,131
from Tucson.
And then the other area of note is 

1529
01:11:46,131 --> 01:11:46,560
Sedona,
right.

1530
01:11:46,561 --> 01:11:51,561
That's where the donor has.
Even Sedona has only a couple places 

1531
01:11:51,561 --> 01:11:53,100
that are really good,
but you'll take that just for the small.

1532
01:11:53,220 --> 01:11:54,620
I just cook myself.
Yeah,

1533
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:59,840
you know,
I just do my own Ravioli's and we know 

1534
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:00,240
we have our own gardens and orchards.
Yeah,

1535
01:12:00,241 --> 01:12:01,710
that is a cool thing.
We have a cook.

1536
01:12:01,770 --> 01:12:04,290
I just started doing that this year.
Grow my own vegetables.

1537
01:12:04,290 --> 01:12:06,350
We'll have like a salad made out of her 
own vegetables.

1538
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:11,360
There's something cool about that.
There's something hunter gatherer that 

1539
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:12,180
just so and it's anybody and even in a 
big city like this,

1540
01:12:12,181 --> 01:12:15,630
if you have one of those apartments that
has like a little bit of dirt near you,

1541
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:19,240
you can make your own food.
Any any square,

1542
01:12:19,290 --> 01:12:23,280
five square feet of dirt near you and 
you're in this community.

1543
01:12:23,281 --> 01:12:27,240
You can grow enough stuff that you can 
get with your neighbors and the trade.

1544
01:12:27,270 --> 01:12:32,270
That's my ultimate goal.
Do the garlic and I'll do the potatoes 

1545
01:12:32,270 --> 01:12:32,580
and tomatoes and then you're just 
trading.

1546
01:12:32,581 --> 01:12:35,660
You're happy.
When I see a cue,

1547
01:12:35,690 --> 01:12:37,890
like do something crazy like start a 
vineyard,

1548
01:12:38,030 --> 01:12:43,030
you know that that to me is far more 
complicated than what I ever wanted to 

1549
01:12:43,030 --> 01:12:43,330
accomplish,
but what I want to accomplish,

1550
01:12:43,390 --> 01:12:47,750
find a way to live sustainably of one 
piece of land.

1551
01:12:48,270 --> 01:12:52,240
Whether it's a farm,
a small family farm or what,

1552
01:12:52,290 --> 01:12:53,550
you know,
livestock,

1553
01:12:53,551 --> 01:12:57,360
just as romantic as it sounds,
it's not necessarily that feasible.

1554
01:12:57,390 --> 01:12:57,840
I mean,
there was,

1555
01:12:57,870 --> 01:13:00,030
there was a lot of draw.
There's a lot of things that just,

1556
01:13:00,150 --> 01:13:02,880
you know,
nature will nature will school you,

1557
01:13:02,940 --> 01:13:07,940
it's,
it ends up really coming down to a 

1558
01:13:07,940 --> 01:13:09,200
collaboration.
It really does come down to,

1559
01:13:09,350 --> 01:13:12,060
to not just hunter gatherer,
a cultivator,

1560
01:13:12,061 --> 01:13:17,061
but also community.
You have to kind of work together to 

1561
01:13:17,061 --> 01:13:17,061
make any of that work.
And that's,

1562
01:13:17,061 --> 01:13:21,441
that's the reality.
There's a lot of people that have that 

1563
01:13:21,441 --> 01:13:23,510
romantic notion of like,
I'm just going to go out to the woods 

1564
01:13:23,510 --> 01:13:25,551
and just,
and just live off the land and you're 

1565
01:13:25,551 --> 01:13:25,890
going to live a very short life.
That's where a cult comes in.

1566
01:13:25,950 --> 01:13:28,650
That's where the coal comes in.
So by the land.

1567
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:29,890
Yeah.
So there's definitely,

1568
01:13:30,180 --> 01:13:32,280
it's definitely possible to do those 
kinds of things.

1569
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:34,100
But as far as quality of life and the 
longevity,

1570
01:13:34,620 --> 01:13:36,390
longevity of life,
uh,

1571
01:13:36,510 --> 01:13:39,630
the collaboration ends up actually 
fitting better that community,

1572
01:13:39,780 --> 01:13:43,950
that village ends up really,
really working hard to find that though,

1573
01:13:43,951 --> 01:13:46,890
isn't it?
It's hard to find some likeminded people

1574
01:13:46,891 --> 01:13:49,610
that you can enjoy it,
but it's already happening.

1575
01:13:49,730 --> 01:13:51,120
There's an entire,
there's entire,

1576
01:13:51,121 --> 01:13:54,900
even where we live in Arizona,
there's entire communities that have,

1577
01:13:54,920 --> 01:13:55,400
uh,
you know,

1578
01:13:55,410 --> 01:13:58,890
the garden garden communities and uh,
you know,

1579
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:00,670
we're making pasta is now,
uh,

1580
01:14:01,050 --> 01:14:05,040
that are from 100 percent Arizona wheat 
so we can grow wheat,

1581
01:14:05,041 --> 01:14:09,450
we make the flower and I can actually 
make pastas for you to go with the wine,

1582
01:14:09,451 --> 01:14:11,710
which we also grow.
But the things we can't,

1583
01:14:11,820 --> 01:14:13,480
I don't have,
we don't make salt,

1584
01:14:14,190 --> 01:14:19,190
you know,
there's like spices you would like to 

1585
01:14:19,190 --> 01:14:20,791
have and that kind of thing.
So it's ends up being your back to the 

1586
01:14:20,791 --> 01:14:20,791
trading,
trading your.

1587
01:14:20,791 --> 01:14:22,780
Whereas with other communities and 
that's great.

1588
01:14:24,070 --> 01:14:27,610
But then just all the nutrition that you
just get the basic,

1589
01:14:27,670 --> 01:14:32,670
a fulfillment of that homegrown stuff.
It resonates on a microfiber level in 

1590
01:14:35,321 --> 01:14:36,310
your body for sure.

1591
01:14:36,460 --> 01:14:37,600
Yeah,
it's pretty bad ass.

1592
01:14:37,660 --> 01:14:40,390
And Arizona is a tricky place to because
you guys don't get a lot of rain.

1593
01:14:40,980 --> 01:14:42,970
We get a little bit of rain and uh,
it's a matter of.

1594
01:14:42,980 --> 01:14:43,030
Yeah,

1595
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:45,560
making sure you're planting in the right
spot where the rain gets to

1596
01:14:47,380 --> 01:14:49,840
the cisterns.
Cisterns,

1597
01:14:49,900 --> 01:14:51,640
yeah.
Do you have water storage?

1598
01:14:51,790 --> 01:14:55,330
Carry the rain water and figure out a 
way to move it.

1599
01:14:56,180 --> 01:14:57,750
Yeah.
It's um,

1600
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,550
if you ever thought about living 
somewhere where it rains a lot,

1601
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:03,710
is that like a better option?
No,

1602
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:05,120
I,
um,

1603
01:15:06,030 --> 01:15:08,700
I just loved the Arizona is just where 
I'm supposed to be.

1604
01:15:08,850 --> 01:15:09,420
Just,
you know,

1605
01:15:09,510 --> 01:15:14,510
I grew up in Michigan,
so that's pretty moist and it's got 

1606
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:18,210
those mosquitoes and deer fly and the 
humidity.

1607
01:15:18,220 --> 01:15:23,220
I just can't,
my body doesn't resonate in that place 

1608
01:15:23,220 --> 01:15:25,551
and uh,
I just get attacked by every bug and 

1609
01:15:25,551 --> 01:15:28,500
every creature known demand and in 
places like Michigan in Seattle or 

1610
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:31,720
Washington state and all that,
but in an Arizona free and clear like 

1611
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:32,910
there's,
there are scorpions.

1612
01:15:32,911 --> 01:15:36,180
I see them now and then I've seen the 
rattle snakes have none of that stuff.

1613
01:15:36,181 --> 01:15:38,220
Bugs me,
know that none of it goes after me.

1614
01:15:38,580 --> 01:15:42,030
My Dad lives in Michigan,
he's in Michigan,

1615
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:45,300
like none of that stuff bugs him.
The deer fly the mosquitoes and stuff,

1616
01:15:45,301 --> 01:15:47,100
it just kind of like bounces off him.
It's fine.

1617
01:15:47,220 --> 01:15:52,220
Comes to Arizona,
immediately gets bit by a brown recluse 

1618
01:15:52,220 --> 01:15:53,320
walloped by tiger.
Chased by a fuck

1619
01:15:53,380 --> 01:15:54,490
rattle snake.
You know,

1620
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:56,740
like all this.
Arizona just went,

1621
01:15:56,741 --> 01:15:58,250
what are you doing here?
Get Out.

1622
01:15:58,690 --> 01:16:00,910
He got bit by a brown recluse.
That's no joke.

1623
01:16:00,911 --> 01:16:02,650
Yeah,
like a big hole in his leg.

1624
01:16:02,860 --> 01:16:04,520
Oh my God.
Yeah.

1625
01:16:04,650 --> 01:16:08,170
Have you seen that discussed?
There's nothing they found,

1626
01:16:08,220 --> 01:16:09,430
uh,
with uh,

1627
01:16:09,580 --> 01:16:14,580
Arizona is um,
a Jaguar's coming across from Mexico.

1628
01:16:16,830 --> 01:16:21,830
There's a,
there was a show called monster quest 

1629
01:16:21,830 --> 01:16:21,830
where there were jaguars.
No,

1630
01:16:21,830 --> 01:16:21,830
no,
no.

1631
01:16:21,830 --> 01:16:21,950
The animal.
Yeah.

1632
01:16:22,420 --> 01:16:24,010
It's leopard in the Africa,
right?

1633
01:16:24,011 --> 01:16:25,330
Jaguar in South America.
I think.

1634
01:16:25,331 --> 01:16:27,810
So they've started to see Jaguars in,
uh,

1635
01:16:27,820 --> 01:16:28,350
in,
in,

1636
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:29,800
in Arizona.
Hunting.

1637
01:16:29,801 --> 01:16:31,190
Republicans are.
No,

1638
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:32,000
no.
Yeah,

1639
01:16:32,050 --> 01:16:33,760
just after a pio,
they just,

1640
01:16:33,761 --> 01:16:38,761
after that Joe Arpaio Guy,
that's gotta be a weird thing 

1641
01:16:38,761 --> 01:16:38,761
representing your state.
You know,

1642
01:16:38,761 --> 01:16:40,900
when you,
when you tell people you're from Arizona

1643
01:16:40,901 --> 01:16:41,530
and they go,
oh yeah,

1644
01:16:41,531 --> 01:16:43,300
that's that fucking guy that makes 
people wear pink.

1645
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:45,270
Yeah,
it's a,

1646
01:16:45,570 --> 01:16:46,350
it's a,
it's a,

1647
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:47,550
it's a wonderful

1648
01:16:47,550 --> 01:16:51,360
state to live in because it's the last 
state of the union where the 48 state,

1649
01:16:51,810 --> 01:16:54,450
so we're kind of the infants and we're 
kind of the mavericks in a way.

1650
01:16:54,451 --> 01:16:57,780
So there's all this unresolved like 
archaic shit that goes on there,

1651
01:16:57,781 --> 01:17:00,750
but there's all this amazing,
beautiful stuff as well that we actually

1652
01:17:00,751 --> 01:17:04,500
get to do because we're not kind of part
of the east coast.

1653
01:17:04,501 --> 01:17:08,010
Like this is how it's done.
We have been here for 200 years.

1654
01:17:08,490 --> 01:17:11,250
It's actually,
we're kind of still finding our way in a

1655
01:17:11,251 --> 01:17:12,290
way.
And so there's,

1656
01:17:12,620 --> 01:17:17,620
there's the good and the bad that goes 
with that and there's probably a lot 

1657
01:17:17,620 --> 01:17:18,680
more bad that always it.
But I don't,

1658
01:17:18,681 --> 01:17:22,430
I'm not exposed to it because I'm good 
on that note.

1659
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:23,700
Uh,
you know,

1660
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:26,240
the wine industry in general is,
was met with like,

1661
01:17:26,930 --> 01:17:27,620
you know,
that's,

1662
01:17:27,860 --> 01:17:29,090
that's,
you know,

1663
01:17:29,091 --> 01:17:30,950
it's alcohol,
it's wine,

1664
01:17:30,951 --> 01:17:31,530
it's,
you know,

1665
01:17:31,850 --> 01:17:36,850
the religious right in the room,
in the conservative Republicans 

1666
01:17:36,850 --> 01:17:36,890
initially were like,
what are you doing?

1667
01:17:36,950 --> 01:17:41,950
But now we've changed.
So we completely changed the 

1668
01:17:41,950 --> 01:17:46,030
agricultural and economic landscape of 
that state with what we're doing with 

1669
01:17:46,030 --> 01:17:47,540
the vineyards to the point where the 
governor,

1670
01:17:47,870 --> 01:17:52,870
God bless her,
has actually gone on record with the 

1671
01:17:52,870 --> 01:17:54,590
municipalities and said,
support what he's doing,

1672
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:57,800
get behind them.
That's how that's.

1673
01:17:58,100 --> 01:18:02,330
So to have a conservative person who was
like probably teetotal or anti alcohol,

1674
01:18:02,331 --> 01:18:07,331
all that kind of stuff.
Or have somebody like that who you 

1675
01:18:07,331 --> 01:18:07,331
already know her story,
like to have them support.

1676
01:18:07,490 --> 01:18:10,850
What you're doing is you're.
We're definitely making a mark.

1677
01:18:11,050 --> 01:18:12,590
Interesting.
That's a beautiful thing.

1678
01:18:12,591 --> 01:18:14,420
If you're governor wasn't a fucking 
moron.

1679
01:18:14,730 --> 01:18:16,610
That chick scary dumb.
She's.

1680
01:18:16,611 --> 01:18:21,611
So,
if you've ever seen some of the debates 

1681
01:18:21,611 --> 01:18:23,201
with her holy Shit,
where they asked her questions and she 

1682
01:18:23,201 --> 01:18:24,370
just locked up and just stopped talking 
and you're like,

1683
01:18:24,380 --> 01:18:29,380
you're not allowed to do that.
Not a lot of stop talking and then she 

1684
01:18:29,380 --> 01:18:29,380
still won.

1685
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:31,220
Whatever that means.
Yeah.

1686
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:33,330
She supports you.
Yeah.

1687
01:18:33,331 --> 01:18:34,030
The,
it's,

1688
01:18:34,060 --> 01:18:39,060
it's an amazing.
It's amazing thing to witness the kind 

1689
01:18:39,060 --> 01:18:39,090
of the naysayers coming around to like,
you know,

1690
01:18:39,340 --> 01:18:41,050
having to like explain to them over and 
over again.

1691
01:18:41,051 --> 01:18:46,051
There's like these small communities in 
Europe that they weather whatever storm 

1692
01:18:46,051 --> 01:18:47,610
you throw it out and they don't care 
who's king or dictator frozen it.

1693
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:52,920
Third small communities,
they're small community to grow their 

1694
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:52,920
own food and the and the cornerstone of 
their,

1695
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:56,830
of their economic stability is our 
vineyards and you know,

1696
01:18:56,831 --> 01:19:01,831
something that takes dedication and time
and focus and commitment to a long term 

1697
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:07,680
thing and then everything around it can 
then sustain itself based on that being 

1698
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:08,020
the hub.

1699
01:19:08,620 --> 01:19:13,620
Do you ever recognize how unique this is
for someone who has achieved your 

1700
01:19:13,620 --> 01:19:16,420
position as a musician and you know,
has some,

1701
01:19:16,700 --> 01:19:21,700
has so much cultural influence to have 
this sort of radical change and just go 

1702
01:19:21,700 --> 01:19:26,671
off and start a vineyard and become a,
a small local business?

1703
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:29,760
No aid.
The community like that.

1704
01:19:29,761 --> 01:19:34,761
I mean,
it's a really kind of an unusual 

1705
01:19:34,761 --> 01:19:34,761
departure.
Well,

1706
01:19:34,761 --> 01:19:36,450
I mean it's only a departure if you're 
only looking at the part of my life that

1707
01:19:36,451 --> 01:19:38,790
had to do with music.
If you're looking at the part of my life

1708
01:19:38,791 --> 01:19:40,570
that came before the music,
you know,

1709
01:19:40,790 --> 01:19:42,420
I was,
I was part of the military.

1710
01:19:42,950 --> 01:19:47,950
I was,
I was accepted to west point it become 

1711
01:19:47,950 --> 01:19:49,050
an officer and I chose not to go to,
so to go into the arts.

1712
01:19:49,580 --> 01:19:51,930
Um,
so I was in some way already doing these

1713
01:19:51,931 --> 01:19:53,070
kinds of things in a way,
you know,

1714
01:19:53,540 --> 01:19:55,470
you got your military and you get your 
politicians.

1715
01:19:55,620 --> 01:20:00,620
Um,
I was kind of part of that part of that 

1716
01:20:00,620 --> 01:20:01,380
structure to begin with organized 
sports,

1717
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:02,910
military ballet.

1718
01:20:05,550 --> 01:20:07,050
So you've,
you've pocket pool,

1719
01:20:07,140 --> 01:20:12,140
you've managed to really be your own 
unique individual.

1720
01:20:12,241 --> 01:20:17,241
You've really managed to not find a 
pattern to fall into but rather fall 

1721
01:20:17,241 --> 01:20:19,050
into the pattern that you felt 
personally

1722
01:20:19,070 --> 01:20:20,810
drawn to kind of like,
again,

1723
01:20:20,811 --> 01:20:23,210
going back to just following your 
intuition about what your decision.

1724
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:25,700
I mean when you're standing there and 
you're having to make a decision,

1725
01:20:25,701 --> 01:20:28,130
like when you received that appointment 
in your hand going,

1726
01:20:28,131 --> 01:20:30,410
okay,
I'm going to be an officer,

1727
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:32,750
I'm going to go to west point when I get
out.

1728
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:35,570
I see.
I can see my future all the way to the,

1729
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:37,160
to the end.
You know,

1730
01:20:37,161 --> 01:20:42,161
classmates of mine are now like kernels 
in charge of several divisions in 

1731
01:20:42,230 --> 01:20:44,510
Afghanistan.
So that would be,

1732
01:20:44,750 --> 01:20:46,370
that would be what I'd be doing right 
now.

1733
01:20:46,430 --> 01:20:47,160
I mean,
you know,

1734
01:20:47,330 --> 01:20:52,330
I can't say that for sure because I'm 
not nearly the day dedicated soldier 

1735
01:20:52,330 --> 01:20:54,020
that those guys are and that kind of 
vision.

1736
01:20:54,021 --> 01:20:56,360
But as far as that part of that 
corporation,

1737
01:20:56,361 --> 01:20:59,910
that part of that company,
that's what I was what I was,

1738
01:21:00,100 --> 01:21:01,940
that's my path was laid out in front of 
me.

1739
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:06,380
So to see that and go,
I can be a part of that whole thing or I

1740
01:21:06,381 --> 01:21:10,520
can follow this feeling in my stomach 
right now and go,

1741
01:21:11,180 --> 01:21:16,180
I think I'm going to go to art school.
So to actually make that decision and 

1742
01:21:16,180 --> 01:21:17,900
have all your friends and your family 
kind of go,

1743
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:23,320
what the fuck did you just do?
And that was long before you'd ever 

1744
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:25,880
heard about me and to know that that's 
what I was supposed to do.

1745
01:21:26,790 --> 01:21:30,320
And to follow that against anybody 
else's advice.

1746
01:21:30,770 --> 01:21:33,150
Um,
you know,

1747
01:21:33,170 --> 01:21:34,430
that's,
that's a strong,

1748
01:21:34,460 --> 01:21:37,910
a strong statement when it comes to 
following one's intuition,

1749
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:40,020
do you realize how inspirational that 
is?

1750
01:21:40,021 --> 01:21:41,980
I mean to,
to a guy like me or two,

1751
01:21:42,060 --> 01:21:44,460
especially two guys coming up that may,
you know,

1752
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:46,140
or,
or they have a vision,

1753
01:21:46,141 --> 01:21:49,020
they have an idea and they see someone 
like you that they admire,

1754
01:21:49,021 --> 01:21:54,021
that has done that and really has so 
obviously carved out the life that they 

1755
01:21:54,991 --> 01:21:58,530
really wanted to live based on their 
intuition,

1756
01:21:58,531 --> 01:22:01,470
based on their idea which so few people 
ever actually do.

1757
01:22:01,650 --> 01:22:03,450
We recognize that influence me because 
that's a,

1758
01:22:03,451 --> 01:22:05,130
that's a huge thing for folks.

1759
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:06,200
Yeah,
always.

1760
01:22:06,230 --> 01:22:08,090
It's always going to come down to what 
you,

1761
01:22:08,690 --> 01:22:10,910
what you were going to decide for you.
Uh,

1762
01:22:11,090 --> 01:22:13,080
it's Kinda hard to.
I had a,

1763
01:22:13,130 --> 01:22:14,110
my old,
uh,

1764
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:15,590
back in,
uh,

1765
01:22:15,850 --> 01:22:17,600
uh,
Michigan.

1766
01:22:17,601 --> 01:22:20,560
I went to a church.
I did go to a church that's,

1767
01:22:20,570 --> 01:22:22,600
I might disappoint you,
but uh,

1768
01:22:22,610 --> 01:22:23,510
she had up.
I went to a few,

1769
01:22:23,660 --> 01:22:25,790
a minister,
a pastor,

1770
01:22:25,820 --> 01:22:26,850
I should say.
Uh,

1771
01:22:27,130 --> 01:22:32,130
and the only reason I went to this place
because the guy made this guy made 

1772
01:22:32,130 --> 01:22:32,130
sense.
Super Low key,

1773
01:22:32,130 --> 01:22:34,040
awesome speaker.
He told stories,

1774
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:35,540
had no judgment.
I mean,

1775
01:22:36,070 --> 01:22:41,070
you know,
there's one point I was having problems 

1776
01:22:41,070 --> 01:22:43,391
and you know,
people or thought that it was way too 

1777
01:22:43,391 --> 01:22:44,960
into kiss and Alice Cooper wanted to get
to talk to the preacher and he called me

1778
01:22:44,961 --> 01:22:47,060
in the Avi and I kind of went into his 
place and he went,

1779
01:22:47,150 --> 01:22:49,640
he shut the door and go,
so tell me all about this band.

1780
01:22:49,910 --> 01:22:52,670
I was like,
I can eat freely and as a small look,

1781
01:22:52,690 --> 01:22:55,130
and he just listened to all of that 
stuff.

1782
01:22:55,700 --> 01:22:57,220
Then he started kissing,
you know,

1783
01:22:59,630 --> 01:23:04,630
can you do,
can you say that with your pants off or 

1784
01:23:04,630 --> 01:23:05,150
nothing like that.
And it was nothing.

1785
01:23:05,170 --> 01:23:10,170
He was just into like,
so what is it about this that like 

1786
01:23:10,170 --> 01:23:10,170
resonates with you?
What is it?

1787
01:23:10,170 --> 01:23:13,060
What is it that inspires you about it?
And I was like telling me stories.

1788
01:23:13,061 --> 01:23:14,320
He goes,
I'm a storyteller.

1789
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:17,890
I like that you'd like to tell stories.
You should tell him more stories.

1790
01:23:18,190 --> 01:23:23,190
And I started writing poetry.
I started writing stuff based on that 

1791
01:23:23,190 --> 01:23:24,800
conversation with him.
So you know,

1792
01:23:24,970 --> 01:23:29,970
out of that.
And they used to tell the story that I 

1793
01:23:29,970 --> 01:23:29,970
thought was very pertinent,
you know,

1794
01:23:29,970 --> 01:23:33,870
you'd go off to camp and you'd have some
experience there and you come back and 

1795
01:23:34,361 --> 01:23:37,060
uh,
whatever you experienced out there,

1796
01:23:37,090 --> 01:23:42,090
whatever,
whatever camp that was you went to 

1797
01:23:42,090 --> 01:23:42,090
metaphorically and you come back to the 
general populous,

1798
01:23:42,130 --> 01:23:42,680
it's you.

1799
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:47,760
He would always tell the story about 
Moses coming down from the mountain and 

1800
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:49,850
having his mountain top experience and 
then coming back down to the rat race to

1801
01:23:49,860 --> 01:23:52,360
where people,
he's a changed person.

1802
01:23:52,390 --> 01:23:57,390
There's something different in his eyes 
and he's watching everything that's 

1803
01:23:57,390 --> 01:24:00,271
happening and there's no possible way he
will ever be able to like explain to his

1804
01:24:01,490 --> 01:24:06,490
people that he sees daily what the fuck 
happened because they didn't happen to 

1805
01:24:06,490 --> 01:24:06,490
them.
It happened to him.

1806
01:24:06,490 --> 01:24:10,220
He saw it and it just has to kind of,
you know,

1807
01:24:10,350 --> 01:24:13,070
his life on that and not be disappointed
in his,

1808
01:24:13,090 --> 01:24:16,180
in his friends and family and his 
community because they didn't see it.

1809
01:24:16,181 --> 01:24:17,260
So it's not,
it's not their fault.

1810
01:24:17,261 --> 01:24:18,880
They didn't,
they didn't experience that.

1811
01:24:18,881 --> 01:24:23,170
But he has to like not.
He has to kind of understand that a,

1812
01:24:23,890 --> 01:24:28,890
everybody has to go through that 
themselves if they're going to go 

1813
01:24:28,890 --> 01:24:28,890
through it.

1814
01:24:28,890 --> 01:24:31,350
Like the other thing we talked about 
with kids going into the military and 

1815
01:24:31,350 --> 01:24:32,170
having that like that moment where 
you're on your own,

1816
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:37,560
you know,
you stick your hand in the jar with the 

1817
01:24:37,560 --> 01:24:37,560
ants and you know,
that kind of thing.

1818
01:24:37,560 --> 01:24:39,790
You're talking about that coming 
becoming an adult,

1819
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:43,180
a Houston.
He would tell that story and it was very

1820
01:24:43,181 --> 01:24:45,730
important,
very important lesson for me to go,

1821
01:24:45,731 --> 01:24:48,250
okay,
you're on your own with these decisions.

1822
01:24:48,251 --> 01:24:50,590
You kind of have to have these things 
and not everybody's going to get it,

1823
01:24:50,620 --> 01:24:52,300
so don't worry about everybody getting 
it.

1824
01:24:52,430 --> 01:24:57,430
Just as long as folks though to have 
that sort of confidence to branch out 

1825
01:24:57,430 --> 01:24:59,780
independently on their own with the 
vision that are terrifying.

1826
01:24:59,930 --> 01:25:03,290
It's terrifying,
but that's the only way you really.

1827
01:25:03,430 --> 01:25:05,030
Yeah.
You can find your own path.

1828
01:25:05,150 --> 01:25:10,150
Yeah.
That's so hard for people to accept and 

1829
01:25:10,150 --> 01:25:10,150
so on.
It's not what people want to hear.

1830
01:25:10,150 --> 01:25:10,150
They,
they,

1831
01:25:10,150 --> 01:25:10,670
they,
they,

1832
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:12,470
you know,
it seems.

1833
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:16,100
It's so terrifying to be completely 
independent of all the people around you

1834
01:25:16,101 --> 01:25:17,420
giving you other advice,
but

1835
01:25:18,220 --> 01:25:21,080
so I want to do it and if you see it,
you know that's,

1836
01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:22,440
that's how,
that's how things happen.

1837
01:25:22,441 --> 01:25:27,441
You see something that's not being done 
or you see something that's your you 

1838
01:25:27,441 --> 01:25:27,770
want to have happen.
If it's not happening,

1839
01:25:27,780 --> 01:25:28,230
go do it.

1840
01:25:28,420 --> 01:25:33,420
It's got to.
You got to be honest with yourself as 

1841
01:25:33,420 --> 01:25:35,081
well to it.
You have to actually know what you 

1842
01:25:35,081 --> 01:25:36,701
really truly want.
A lot of people will talk themselves 

1843
01:25:36,701 --> 01:25:39,311
into things that they want because 
there's maybe security in it or they 

1844
01:25:39,311 --> 01:25:43,100
could see a connect the dots future.
But Dude,

1845
01:25:43,220 --> 01:25:45,590
thank you very much for coming on this 
podcast and been amazing.

1846
01:25:45,591 --> 01:25:47,330
It's a.
you've got an awesome story,

1847
01:25:47,331 --> 01:25:52,331
man.
You're a bad motherfucker and you've 

1848
01:25:52,331 --> 01:25:52,331
done a lot of cool shit and it was 
really fun.

1849
01:25:52,331 --> 01:25:53,760
We enjoyed it.
Thank you for having me.

1850
01:25:54,050 --> 01:25:57,200
I'm really sorry about Brian.
Wrong with.

1851
01:25:57,920 --> 01:25:59,150
Sorry.
I was nervous around him.

1852
01:25:59,370 --> 01:26:00,450
It's natural.
Sure.

1853
01:26:00,510 --> 01:26:03,740
I will wear pants next time if you ever 
come back.

1854
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:03,990
That

1855
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,060
was.
That was kind of awkward,

1856
01:26:05,061 --> 01:26:06,600
but like I got over it.
Oh,

1857
01:26:06,620 --> 01:26:08,350
thanks for the wine.
The wine is fantastic.

1858
01:26:08,450 --> 01:26:13,450
People want to get a hold of it.
It's just you have to caduceus and the 

1859
01:26:14,091 --> 01:26:19,091
other one,
American vineyard market vineyards and 

1860
01:26:19,091 --> 01:26:20,960
they can get them at most fine wine show
available online.

1861
01:26:21,230 --> 01:26:21,920
Uh,
yeah.

1862
01:26:21,921 --> 01:26:23,480
Uh,
we have a website,

1863
01:26:23,500 --> 01:26:28,500
a Vino dot [inaudible] dot org.
We're going to start taking preorders 

1864
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:30,710
but no problem living in Arizona is we 
can't ship during the summer at all.

1865
01:26:30,711 --> 01:26:34,250
It just gets too hot and everything that
we ship goes through Phoenix and sits on

1866
01:26:34,251 --> 01:26:36,380
a hot truck at 100,
10 degrees overnight.

1867
01:26:36,381 --> 01:26:39,650
So a kinship there and you have to wait 
till October to ship stuff.

1868
01:26:39,860 --> 01:26:41,520
Oh Wow.
But we have some sort.

1869
01:26:41,540 --> 01:26:46,540
How does that work?
We had some pretty awesome stuff coming 

1870
01:26:46,540 --> 01:26:46,540
out on,
you know,

1871
01:26:46,540 --> 01:26:50,330
going to be available to the first week 
of August for release in October.

1872
01:26:50,510 --> 01:26:50,960
Awesome.

1873
01:26:51,130 --> 01:26:51,790
So,
uh,

1874
01:26:51,820 --> 01:26:56,820
that's when people.
Is there a stuff available now or is it 

1875
01:26:56,820 --> 01:26:56,820
you have such limited amounts that

1876
01:26:56,820 --> 01:27:01,770
places like silver lake wine or mission 
wines or Kennel wine merchants to a lot 

1877
01:27:01,770 --> 01:27:05,491
of those guys have stuff that we've 
distributed and across around the 

1878
01:27:05,491 --> 01:27:05,491
country at 10,
you know,

1879
01:27:05,491 --> 01:27:07,060
we're only in a very,
just a handful of states.

1880
01:27:07,240 --> 01:27:08,770
We just.
Our production is so low.

1881
01:27:08,771 --> 01:27:10,930
Again,
people want what they want,

1882
01:27:10,931 --> 01:27:15,931
but when it comes to the wine,
there's only so much that's going to 

1883
01:27:15,931 --> 01:27:18,691
come off this site and we have very 
limited amounts and it's a very special 

1884
01:27:18,691 --> 01:27:19,450
thing,
so we're not gonna.

1885
01:27:19,480 --> 01:27:22,930
We can't even if I wanted to increase 
the production on some of these things,

1886
01:27:22,931 --> 01:27:27,880
we're just never gonna have enough to 
just basically be in every grocery store

1887
01:27:27,881 --> 01:27:32,881
around the country.
It's pretty obvious that you take great 

1888
01:27:32,881 --> 01:27:32,881
pride and satisfaction in your work.
I mean,

1889
01:27:32,881 --> 01:27:35,790
when you're talking about your one,
you have a certain feeling about you,

1890
01:27:35,791 --> 01:27:38,050
like this is something you're really 
happy with.

1891
01:27:39,090 --> 01:27:39,700
Yeah.
It's a,

1892
01:27:39,850 --> 01:27:42,340
it's a,
it's a very fulfilling endeavor.

1893
01:27:42,430 --> 01:27:43,060
It's a,
it's a,

1894
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:48,120
it's an art form that's like no other 
and it's kind of connected.

1895
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:52,480
Grapes are a very special being.
They're special.

1896
01:27:53,820 --> 01:27:57,330
We have some website.
I really enjoyed this podcast very much.

1897
