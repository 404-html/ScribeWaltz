1
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:09,450
It was like you don't trust it,
but didn't start think.

2
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,030
Oh,
Hello Michael.

3
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:13,230
Hello Joe.
Good to see you,

4
00:00:13,231 --> 00:00:14,280
buddy.
Good to see you.

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,400
So this main thing to talk about,
but one of them is why don't you have a 

6
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,430
fucking blue check next to your name?
I do on twitter where it matters,

7
00:00:20,431 --> 00:00:22,440
but not on instagram.
Instagram doesn't matter.

8
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:28,190
Well it does stop.
You're hurting like I've in into shade 

9
00:00:28,551 --> 00:00:33,551
the fuck.
I'm just trying to figure out who we 

10
00:00:33,551 --> 00:00:34,800
need to contact the sunshine.
The shade everywhere.

11
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:35,180
What the hell?

12
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:36,470
Oh God.
God.

13
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:36,810
God.

14
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,260
Well,
how do they decide who gets a blue check

15
00:00:40,261 --> 00:00:42,210
mark and who doesn't instance the 
hardest one?

16
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:42,970
Really?
Yeah.

17
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:45,840
What do you have to get?
I wouldn't know Joe.

18
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:48,480
I wouldn't know.
I don't have an insect blue check mark.

19
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:50,280
I'm just curious.
It's hurts my feelings.

20
00:00:50,281 --> 00:00:52,240
I'm not even verified on facebook.
I'm A.

21
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,380
I'm A.
Yeah.

22
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,910
Wow.
I'm a pledge.

23
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:57,600
But you've been on television.
You've published books.

24
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,030
Yeah.
What in the fuck I these people.

25
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:02,940
This is why we need regulation.
The social media giants.

26
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:05,580
This is outrageous.
What do you think

27
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:10,610
about that idea?
That there should be some sort of 

28
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:13,521
regulation like rules as to what 
constitutes something that can pull you 

29
00:01:13,801 --> 00:01:16,530
off of the social media platform by the 
law.

30
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:17,670
Yes,
but by the law.

31
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:19,890
That's unconscionable.
It's unconscionable.

32
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,920
Yeah,
but is it constable that someone can 

33
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,570
just decide based on their political 
affiliation that they don't like the way

34
00:01:27,571 --> 00:01:30,100
someone is talking and pull them off the
plan?

35
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,970
I,
I believe in freedom of association,

36
00:01:31,971 --> 00:01:34,790
which means if you want to dissociate 
from anyone at any time,

37
00:01:34,791 --> 00:01:36,410
not only do you can,
you do it,

38
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,210
you shouldn't even have to give a 
reason.

39
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:38,870
It's up to you.

40
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:44,760
Is that what's happening when you pull 
someone off of a social media platform 

41
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:44,760
is just this association?

42
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,480
Yeah,
but there's also.

43
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:50,660
The problem with that is they're not 
being honest and upfront about why 

44
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:50,660
they're doing it.
Right,

45
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:51,840
so they're being deceptive because 
they're saying they're being objective.

46
00:01:51,841 --> 00:01:52,830
If they want to say,
look,

47
00:01:52,831 --> 00:01:55,380
the cost of having this person on 
outweighs the benefit.

48
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:56,700
Okay.
You can wrap your head around it,

49
00:01:56,701 --> 00:01:58,050
but they twitter,
facebook,

50
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,760
twitter especially.
They say,

51
00:01:59,761 --> 00:02:04,761
we're not going to tell you what the 
rules are because then people will be 

52
00:02:04,761 --> 00:02:04,761
able to exploit them.
It's like,

53
00:02:04,761 --> 00:02:06,060
well,
if you tell us what the rules are,

54
00:02:06,061 --> 00:02:08,430
maybe we can follow them and you don't 
have to live in fear.

55
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,500
That is a hilarious way of interpreting 
it.

56
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,710
People would exploit those rules.
That's the quote from Jack Dorsey.

57
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,500
That is a ridiculous quote.
Yeah.

58
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,110
What about following the rules?
I mean,

59
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,610
guidelines are supposed to be there so 
that you don't step outside of it.

60
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,570
That's exactly right and they're 
supposed to that way.

61
00:02:22,571 --> 00:02:27,571
You can also say we're being objective 
because it's like we're following these 

62
00:02:27,571 --> 00:02:28,160
guidelines that we set that are open.
Do you think

63
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:33,460
perhaps something that was brought to 
them by lawyers with Laura's like 

64
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,850
Muslim,
the more you tell them what they can and

65
00:02:34,851 --> 00:02:39,851
can't do,
the more difficult it's going to be to 

66
00:02:39,851 --> 00:02:39,851
justify kicking someone off?

67
00:02:39,851 --> 00:02:43,050
No,
I think they have their hardcore agenda 

68
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:43,050
and this way they can cover their 
tracks.

69
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:45,310
I don't think this is the lawyers at all
because then they blamed the lawyers.

70
00:02:45,311 --> 00:02:46,540
They'd say,
legally we have to x,

71
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,830
Y,
and z.

72
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:48,830
So

73
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:53,860
you think it's just they have a very 
strong political leaning and anything 

74
00:02:54,411 --> 00:02:56,930
that deviates from that,
they want to just get removed from the.

75
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:00,280
I wouldn't say political,
I'd say and philosophical,

76
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,930
but yeah.
Not that they want to,

77
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:03,910
but they regard as having less 
legitimacy.

78
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,800
Do you see the Tucker Carlson show 
yesterday?

79
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:06,670
Yeah.
What?

80
00:03:06,671 --> 00:03:07,600
Of course.
The big victims.

81
00:03:07,601 --> 00:03:08,950
Jim Acosta?
Yeah.

82
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,810
You know,
so there's two scenarios.

83
00:03:10,811 --> 00:03:12,730
One is you're not allowed to come to my 
house anymore.

84
00:03:12,731 --> 00:03:15,070
The other one is my house is being 
surrounded by the purge,

85
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:17,380
but clearly the first one is the 
nightmare scenario.

86
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:22,980
Yeah.
Well the Jim Acosta one was strange 

87
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:22,980
because Jim Acosta,
like,

88
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:25,280
it wasn't supposed to be talking then.
Right,

89
00:03:25,281 --> 00:03:27,070
right.
He was interrupting.

90
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:32,530
He was deciding that he was more 
important than the other person who's 

91
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:32,530
talking.
Right.

92
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:34,000
And he was also deciding that he was 
more important than everyone else in the

93
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:39,001
room.
And he's also deciding that having a 

94
00:03:39,001 --> 00:03:39,001
White House press the grandchild is a 
human.

95
00:03:39,001 --> 00:03:39,520
Right.
So basically,

96
00:03:39,521 --> 00:03:40,510
you know,
you could do over your one.

97
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:44,140
It'll never be taken away,
but there's gotta be some decorum.

98
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,100
Right.
Well,

99
00:03:45,101 --> 00:03:50,101
their argument,
I would guess I can't speak for Jim 

100
00:03:50,101 --> 00:03:50,101
Acosta because I could speak in normal 
voice,

101
00:03:50,101 --> 00:03:54,150
but they're arguing with that because 
the president has made things so lack of

102
00:03:54,461 --> 00:03:58,000
decor and when she has children,
therefore they're following suit.

103
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:03,030
So I guess that's real leadership,
but this month is really kicking in.

104
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,290
Yeah.
You like it?

105
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:05,000
Oh yeah.
A lot.

106
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:10,020
A lot of stuff going on.
Karen got the Taurine it says.

107
00:04:10,511 --> 00:04:11,680
Yeah.
So yeah,

108
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,060
that's,
you know,

109
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:14,740
it's unfortunate.
I mean,

110
00:04:14,741 --> 00:04:19,741
look,
I think I appreciate the fact that he 

111
00:04:19,741 --> 00:04:21,460
goes out of his way to question the 
whitehouse narrative when he goes out of

112
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:22,510
his way.
That's his job.

113
00:04:22,511 --> 00:04:23,160
Yeah.
Yeah.

114
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:28,170
To,
to put the irons to the president and 

115
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:28,240
get them to answer questions,
but you can't do that while someone else

116
00:04:28,241 --> 00:04:30,580
is talking.
The other guy had the microphone.

117
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:32,730
You're the guy was supposed to be 
talking right here.

118
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:37,910
Well,
this is why I think he is unforgivable 

119
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,620
because during the Singapore summit,
when you had president trump and Kim 

120
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,200
Jong Un from North Korea and they're 
making,

121
00:04:41,201 --> 00:04:44,650
signing a piece of paper and they're 
trying to kind of hopefully go towards a

122
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:47,200
peaceful direction,
a cost that gets up and yells,

123
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,010
hey,
uh,

124
00:04:48,011 --> 00:04:50,200
what about Ottawa Beer Marshal?
Kim Johnson.

125
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:50,910
What?
Online beard.

126
00:04:50,911 --> 00:04:54,240
It's like you got this guy who's got 25 
million hostages.

127
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:57,550
He's hold on taking the first step that 
dropping his gun.

128
00:04:57,551 --> 00:04:58,060
You're like,
Hey,

129
00:04:58,061 --> 00:05:01,180
what about that kid you killed?
What about a time and a place?

130
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:02,950
And I don't think Kim Jong Un's speaks 
English.

131
00:05:02,951 --> 00:05:04,120
I'm pretty sure he doesn't.
So,

132
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:09,430
uh,
I think the guy took wrestling a little 

133
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:09,430
too seriously.
Uh,

134
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,380
and I don't know what it is.
I mean,

135
00:05:11,381 --> 00:05:12,430
you know,
a lot of reporters.

136
00:05:12,431 --> 00:05:14,110
I know that our report is,
they don't act like this.

137
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:19,170
No,
I think he likes attention and I think 

138
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:22,210
he feels like there's something very 
significant about what he's doing.

139
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:24,190
And He,
I think he also wants to be a martyr.

140
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:26,620
He wants to be a,
you know,

141
00:05:26,621 --> 00:05:27,580
like every like,
you know,

142
00:05:27,581 --> 00:05:29,740
he's got the weight of the world on his 
shoulders in,

143
00:05:29,741 --> 00:05:33,280
but for him we'd be facing Nazi Germany.
Yeah,

144
00:05:33,281 --> 00:05:38,281
it's,
it's the question is like when does 

145
00:05:38,281 --> 00:05:39,820
someone get their press credentials 
removed from the White House?

146
00:05:39,821 --> 00:05:44,821
When,
when can they no longer have whitehouse 

147
00:05:44,821 --> 00:05:44,821
credentials?
When is,

148
00:05:44,821 --> 00:05:48,510
what is what?
What do you have to do to the point 

149
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:50,330
where everyone agrees you're a nuisance 
and you're interrupting regularly.

150
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,790
CNN could just get someone else,
right?

151
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:57,900
Who's not going to scream out?
It's not like they're trying to block 

152
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:58,160
CNN.
It's like they're to this guy like

153
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,660
you,
you,

154
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:02,430
you are interrupting like you're yelling
things out and then what?

155
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,100
Have everyone yelled things out at the 
same time.

156
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:06,200
Are you better than everyone else 
because you're not.

157
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:09,080
You're just a person here and if you 
just decide,

158
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:13,880
my opinion in my voice is more 
significant than anyone else's will you?

159
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,160
You've thrown everybody else under the 
bus the entire rest of the room and the 

160
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,601
whole process.
I remember Leslie Stahl had trump on 60 

161
00:06:22,601 --> 00:06:22,601
minutes,
not that long ago and you know,

162
00:06:22,601 --> 00:06:23,300
they're going back and forth and she 
goes,

163
00:06:23,301 --> 00:06:23,750
Oh,
you know,

164
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,280
well I don't want to talk about that.
I'm like,

165
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:27,440
this is the fucking president.
You're a reporter.

166
00:06:27,441 --> 00:06:32,441
If he wants to talk about it at the very
least it's going to be the president 

167
00:06:32,441 --> 00:06:32,441
says x,
Y,

168
00:06:32,441 --> 00:06:32,441
and Z,
so who are you to be like,

169
00:06:32,441 --> 00:06:32,570
Nigga,
shut up.

170
00:06:32,571 --> 00:06:33,530
We're not going to talk about this.

171
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:34,160
And he's like,
well,

172
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:35,210
fuck you.
I'm the president.

173
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:40,490
So I think there is.
I'm glad this is happening because I 

174
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:43,070
think for a long time the press who has 
had an agenda since Washington's days as

175
00:06:43,071 --> 00:06:48,071
they should have an agenda,
pretend that they're honest and 

176
00:06:48,071 --> 00:06:49,370
objective and they use the veneer of 
politeness and civility to be like,

177
00:06:49,371 --> 00:06:50,600
look,
we're professional,

178
00:06:50,601 --> 00:06:53,780
we're decent people,
but now the mask is dropping and you see

179
00:06:53,781 --> 00:06:54,710
that they're,
you know,

180
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:56,690
often lunatics.
Yeah,

181
00:06:56,691 --> 00:07:01,691
I was watching this piece on.
I really wish I remember what it was on,

182
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,660
but it was on.
Um,

183
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:08,710
maybe I was listening to it either way 
it was on the news and when the news 

184
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:12,170
started becoming an entertainment 
program versus when it was just,

185
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:15,780
here's the events of the day and this 
is,

186
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:21,080
this is what the,
the significance of these events could 

187
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:21,500
be and this is the impact it could have 
on our society.

188
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:26,060
Instead it just became this really 
flamboyant,

189
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:27,860
wild,
crazy.

190
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:31,400
If it bleeds,
it leads and it became entertainment and

191
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:36,760
they really nail it down to 60 minutes.
They were saying when 60 minutes became 

192
00:07:36,891 --> 00:07:40,640
a hugely successful financial show,
what's that in the seventies then?

193
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,490
Somewhere around there,
right when was 60 minutes.

194
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:45,320
It's been around for a long,
long time,

195
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:46,220
long,
long time.

196
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,850
But when 60 minutes became a hit,
it was a hit show,

197
00:07:49,851 --> 00:07:52,460
like big advertiser money.
It was,

198
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:57,480
you know,
the entire country would watch it and 

199
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,771
then that sort of changed the way they 
viewed the news because now they've 

200
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:01,550
viewed the news as a potentially 
profitable venture.

201
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:03,350
And then,
boy,

202
00:08:03,351 --> 00:08:08,351
once I realized that people can clearly 
affiliate with one side versus another 

203
00:08:08,901 --> 00:08:11,000
side and they want that and their news 
coverage,

204
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:15,020
then you get the Weird Fox News slash 
CNN bias,

205
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:20,410
which is,
it is one of the weirdest polar like 

206
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:20,410
distinctions.

207
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:25,360
If you watch the news,
you watch television during the 

208
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:25,790
elections particular anything that's 
really significant going on.

209
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:27,780
You go back and forth between.
The two of them were like,

210
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,280
are we just separate universes?
Oh yeah.

211
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:35,590
Scott Adams has that metaphor which is 
that we're looking at one movie screen 

212
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:39,761
and there's two movies in one movie 
screen that different people see this 

213
00:08:39,761 --> 00:08:40,250
exact same data and see different 
conclusions.

214
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:45,700
And I think that's great.
I mean I think I don't think we need to 

215
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:49,361
be all united.
I think people should like what they 

216
00:08:49,361 --> 00:08:50,270
like and the idea that we all got a 
great and everything is totalitarianism.

217
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:53,420
Yeah.
I mean I definitely think that we should

218
00:08:53,421 --> 00:08:56,310
be able to enjoy what we enjoy and

219
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,140
we should lean whatever way we choose to
lean.

220
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,320
I think the issue with the news though 
is when it's just straight up 

221
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:03,320
propaganda.
Yeah.

222
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,790
Like when is,
when is this actually the real objective

223
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:10,791
version of the events or when are they 
deleting and editing stuff out and 

224
00:09:10,921 --> 00:09:15,540
adding things to concentrating on one 
maybe possibly insignificant thing,

225
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:20,660
but pumping it up to be more than it is 
because then it changes the narrative 

226
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:20,660
for their side.

227
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:20,960
Uh,
this morning I,

228
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:23,020
I went after some dimwit from Memphis,
from,

229
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,290
excuse me,
from NBC,

230
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:29,291
and he goes,
this is the worst attack by the White 

231
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:29,291
House and the press freedoms in history.
I go,

232
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:33,491
John Adams,
second precedent put journalists in 

233
00:09:33,491 --> 00:09:33,491
jail.
So did Lincoln.

234
00:09:33,491 --> 00:09:37,540
Lincoln.
Of course you could say it's the civil 

235
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,071
war,
but there have been many cases of 

236
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,721
attacks on the press.
But of course because everyone is so 

237
00:09:40,721 --> 00:09:40,721
narcissistic,
if it's happening to them,

238
00:09:40,721 --> 00:09:45,280
it's the worst thing ever.
And this is basically the gulag even 

239
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:45,280
though they can go on twitter and have 
100,000

240
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:45,590
followers,
I have,

241
00:09:45,591 --> 00:09:46,880
they're good book deals with the 
consequences.

242
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,260
Is anybody criticizing Jim Acosta from 
the left?

243
00:09:50,261 --> 00:09:51,640
Is anybody saying like,
Hey,

244
00:09:51,641 --> 00:09:54,040
you're not supposed to do that.
Like what you did,

245
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:56,080
what you did is out of line.

246
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:57,410
I haven't,
I have,

247
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,810
I've been having fun in La.
I have not seen that.

248
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:02,960
I think they have been running 
interference because I do think that the

249
00:10:02,961 --> 00:10:04,790
press corps,
like any organization you work with,

250
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:09,791
some of the side by side every day 
you're going to be friendly with them 

251
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:09,791
and,
and I do think they,

252
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:14,240
there is very much obviously acrimony 
between Sarah Sanders and the White 

253
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,700
House press corps and she's very 
insulting and hostile to them and you 

254
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:22,301
could say it's deserved or not.
So of course they're going to kind of 

255
00:10:22,301 --> 00:10:22,301
team up together,
be like,

256
00:10:22,301 --> 00:10:25,900
lady,
we're just trying to do our job and 

257
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:25,900
you're just spitting on our face every 
single day.

258
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,320
Now the question is,
do these people have,

259
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,850
should have their faces spit it in or 
not?

260
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,730
Well,
I think they both suck.

261
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:35,340
You know,
I think what she's doing sucks.

262
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:37,730
Like the way she treats people,
like some shoes,

263
00:10:37,731 --> 00:10:40,050
some fucking school teacher in seventh 
grade.

264
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:43,080
That's what it seems like when Sarah's 
doing those,

265
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,210
those White House press things.

266
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:50,770
I Love Venom,
so I love that the venom is flowing in 

267
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:53,060
both directions and the mid like it 
because I,

268
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:58,450
I think people get over politically by 
saying let's all get along and then 

269
00:10:58,761 --> 00:11:03,761
people who don't get along or 
marginalized and those are the ones who 

270
00:11:03,761 --> 00:11:06,371
innovate things that the troublemakers,
other ones who move culture and move 

271
00:11:06,371 --> 00:11:07,040
politics.
So whenever everyone gets together,

272
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:07,240
like,
oh,

273
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:10,660
90 percent of us agree.
Then where fits venom.

274
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,300
It's like,
yeah,

275
00:11:11,301 --> 00:11:16,301
if this country has been at least two 
culture since the beginning and it only 

276
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:20,110
stayed one because one conquered the 
other and held it under martial law for 

277
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:23,321
decades.
There's no reason for us to be one 

278
00:11:23,321 --> 00:11:23,321
United States.
Uh,

279
00:11:23,321 --> 00:11:23,840
when everyone hates each other.
Like,

280
00:11:23,841 --> 00:11:24,950
why?
Let's have a divorce.

281
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,980
What do you mean?
Like just if you want to separate it out

282
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:30,920
America to different parts.
I think everyone get along a lot nicer.

283
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:36,150
You do.
You mean like make separate countries 

284
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:36,750
out of America?
Of course like Europe.

285
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,990
Like how,
like if you looked at the size of Europe

286
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:44,991
and the relative size of countries and 
how easy it is to travel from one 

287
00:11:44,991 --> 00:11:48,441
country to another,
you can make a real honest comparison 

288
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:51,651
between Texas and New Jersey.
I mean they basically are different 

289
00:11:51,651 --> 00:11:51,651
countries,

290
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,980
right?
I mean it's because we all speak

291
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:58,980
English,
so it seems like we're one we're united 

292
00:11:58,980 --> 00:11:58,980
on and like why does this have to be 
this way?

293
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,520
Well,
because Texas will start invading.

294
00:12:00,521 --> 00:12:05,521
Everybody can just do that.
Man.

295
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:10,870
Prison will just steal New Mexico.
Like whose garden it?

296
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:16,540
That's ours now.
And then they'll just start marching 

297
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:19,471
their way through Phoenix and yeah,
it's a fucking disaster waiting to 

298
00:12:19,471 --> 00:12:22,651
happen.
I think this is a disaster that's 

299
00:12:22,651 --> 00:12:22,651
happening.
Oh yeah.

300
00:12:22,651 --> 00:12:25,710
And I think the acrimony which I enjoy 
on some level because I think it's 

301
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:26,680
honest,
is going to get much worse.

302
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:32,130
Really.
What makes you think he's going to get 

303
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:33,751
worse?
Because I think both sides are just 

304
00:12:33,751 --> 00:12:33,780
doubling down both sides left and right.
Yeah.

305
00:12:33,781 --> 00:12:37,930
I very much doubling down the right has 
become radicalized as function of trump.

306
00:12:37,931 --> 00:12:42,400
The left has been radicalized for 
decades and there's no look,

307
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,110
here's what happened with capital 
hearings.

308
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:49,200
Either this very innocent family man has
been railroaded completely by shameless 

309
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,600
leftist or someone who is quite possibly
a rapist,

310
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,430
was nominated,
was puts us supreme court,

311
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:55,960
uh,
without being.

312
00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:01,260
And everyone knows it.
So there's no in between and when you 

313
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,700
have one event and two completely 
obscenely different perspectives,

314
00:13:03,701 --> 00:13:05,230
meeting each side,
sees the others have seen,

315
00:13:05,231 --> 00:13:07,510
I don't see where you get together.
Well,

316
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:12,540
don't you have a different perspective 
on it than either one of those polar 

317
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,260
burn it all down?
Nobody been with Kevin.

318
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:15,880
Uh,
I,

319
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:20,970
my perspective is I don't agree with the
constitution or regardless Valis I don't

320
00:13:22,421 --> 00:13:23,440
care.
Uh,

321
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:24,330
I,
I,

322
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:26,400
I don't know how I would vote if our 
center,

323
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:27,250
to be honest.
Uh,

324
00:13:27,251 --> 00:13:31,360
I don't think she was lying a Dr Ford 
obviously sweat.

325
00:13:31,361 --> 00:13:32,910
Nick I think was lying in the one who's 
like,

326
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:37,920
you know,
I went to 10 parties and kept getting 

327
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:37,920
gang raped a,
at a certain point,

328
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,281
you know,
it's just like there was two different 

329
00:13:41,281 --> 00:13:41,460
women that had absolutely fabricated 
stories that.

330
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:43,070
But that doesn't mean Dr Ford's 
fabricated,

331
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,530
right?
So it doesn't,

332
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,090
but it just shows you that,
that,

333
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,140
that whole zoo can get pretty,
pretty smelling.

334
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:55,260
I can't imagine any job on earth where 
you need to be talking about your 

335
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,670
yearbook quotes and I don't run it.
It's just that 30 plus years later,

336
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,750
30 plus years.
Yeah.

337
00:13:58,751 --> 00:14:01,240
So I mean,
and here's the issue with Kevin.

338
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:04,150
This is why I think it's really unfair.
Uh,

339
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:06,610
how come they're not asking him to step?
If he had,

340
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:08,440
why didn't.
No one asked him to step down from.

341
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:10,450
He was already on the court.
He was just want to supreme court.

342
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,790
If you believed all this stuff,
why don't you ask him to resign,

343
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:16,150
right?
If this is so serious.

344
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:17,860
Yeah.
And then on top of that,

345
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:21,160
why didn't they really,
especially the left,

346
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:26,161
why didn't they go whole hog into all of
his policy decisions which are much eat 

347
00:14:26,381 --> 00:14:29,110
fairer and more Germane.
Now Dr Ford,

348
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:31,240
I saw her on the side of a milk carton 
the other day.

349
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:34,180
She's vanished.
Like as soon as her purpose was served,

350
00:14:34,181 --> 00:14:35,470
she's gone.
You know,

351
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,680
she probably wants to vanish.
Doesn't seem like she was really 

352
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,190
enjoying her.
She wrote that letter in secret and then

353
00:14:42,191 --> 00:14:44,080
there's the whole investigation.
How did this become public?

354
00:14:44,081 --> 00:14:49,081
She's like,
I didn't want this to be public and I 

355
00:14:49,081 --> 00:14:49,081
believe her.
She didn't.

356
00:14:49,081 --> 00:14:52,080
I don't think anyone want this 
testifying from the Senate in a hearing 

357
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:52,130
like

358
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,930
that where the knives are out.
That's terrifying.

359
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:58,960
Can you imagine?
There's a few people that would enjoy 

360
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:58,960
it,
but yeah,

361
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:58,960
to your point,
not her,

362
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:02,980
not her.
She didn't seem like it and she didn't 

363
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:02,980
see it,
but you know,

364
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:05,900
I don't think that she was lying either,
but also boy,

365
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:07,730
wow.
You want to get,

366
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:13,810
you want to go into what we understand.
We actually understand about the human 

367
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:17,681
memory and you want to stand in front of
many,

368
00:15:18,801 --> 00:15:23,801
many people,
millions worldwide with incredible 

369
00:15:23,801 --> 00:15:25,340
consequences on the line and relay 
these,

370
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:30,490
these memories from 30 plus years ago 
when you mean you're not even the same 

371
00:15:30,831 --> 00:15:33,410
human being as you were when you were 17
years old.

372
00:15:33,411 --> 00:15:37,360
It's just like it's.
I don't even have memories of being 17.

373
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:41,690
I have memories of things that I've told
about my memories.

374
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:43,370
I mean the,
you know what I mean,

375
00:15:43,371 --> 00:15:46,240
like you of course you remember the 
story teller.

376
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,530
Yeah.
You tell stories of what you remember,

377
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:53,531
but if I had to like give you the real 
solid memories that are unquestionable 

378
00:15:55,161 --> 00:15:59,960
about my 17th year of life,
it's fucking shaky shit.

379
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:05,140
Real shaky.
Obviously nobody tried to hold my mouth 

380
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:08,321
closed,
fuck me on a bed and some weird party 

381
00:16:08,321 --> 00:16:08,321
when I was half drunk and I really 
wanted to go home.

382
00:16:08,321 --> 00:16:10,160
Not that you remember.
I don't think it happened.

383
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:12,500
Pretty sure it didn't happen.
No,

384
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:14,570
but I couldn't,
I couldn't testify.

385
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:16,520
And in all fairness to her,
uh,

386
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:17,760
trauma,
uh,

387
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:22,780
if I'm using the word loosely also 
things get mixed up and things like 

388
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:26,951
that.
There are people who think she's a 

389
00:16:26,951 --> 00:16:29,591
complete fraud and thought she knew she 
was going to get money from go fund me 

390
00:16:29,591 --> 00:16:29,600
and I'm like,
I don't say it.

391
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,070
That doesn't make any sense to me.
Yeah.

392
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:34,690
I don't think a 55 year old professor 
knows how crowdfunding works.

393
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,860
Yeah.
But you know,

394
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,870
one thing that I did see that was 
fascinating though was the,

395
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:44,030
the,
the university that she teaches a is so 

396
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:46,130
heavily skewed towards women,
like it's almost,

397
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:51,370
I think it's 70 something percent female
students and a high percentage of uh,

398
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:55,520
like predominantly female professors as 
well.

399
00:16:56,180 --> 00:17:01,180
And their whole thing is social justice 
that's there when you know their lists 

400
00:17:02,661 --> 00:17:07,661
or objectives as far as education,
like social justice is number one.

401
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:13,360
It's number one.
It's like the thing that they emphasize 

402
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:13,360
the most,
what's it going to be?

403
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,030
Architecture education.
Sure.

404
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:22,060
I guess.
But I think universities are there to 

405
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:22,130
promulgate and ideology,
right?

406
00:17:22,131 --> 00:17:26,750
But they literally framed it as social 
justice and that does that term today is

407
00:17:26,751 --> 00:17:28,580
so fraught with peril.
Oh yeah.

408
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:29,660
Yeah.
It's the enemy.

409
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:31,370
Yeah.
It's such a goofy term,

410
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,800
like social justice,
like it,

411
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:38,940
it's,
so it's such a blanket term and so all 

412
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:39,030
encompassing and you know,
you,

413
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:44,100
you hear it and you start thinking about
people banging on Tucker Carlson's door 

414
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:44,570
and saying,
we know where you sleep.

415
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:45,740
That's what I hear.
I mean.

416
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:46,440
Oh yeah.
No.

417
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:51,490
And here's,
like I was just talking about just a 

418
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:53,680
couple of ago,
it means 90 percent of people have 

419
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,091
agreed that 10 percent or don't agree,
you need to be shut down because we're 

420
00:17:56,091 --> 00:17:56,091
talking about social justice.
So the,

421
00:17:56,091 --> 00:17:58,410
there's no such thing as individual 
justice because that's subordinate.

422
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:04,040
Well,
I don't even know what percentage of 

423
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:04,710
people would agree with banging on a 
guy's house,

424
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,010
like knocking on his door and saying,
we know where your sleep.

425
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:08,950
I mean,
did you,

426
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:13,230
this is a form of mental terrorism,
like you're threatening him.

427
00:18:13,231 --> 00:18:16,830
You're scaring him.
I don't think most people are capable of

428
00:18:16,831 --> 00:18:19,800
empathy by which they mean they can't 
put themselves in tucker shoes.

429
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:23,200
So all they see is someone I hate had 
something bad happens.

430
00:18:23,201 --> 00:18:25,950
I him good.
And they don't understand.

431
00:18:25,951 --> 00:18:30,090
Like when these Republicans are saying 
that it's okay to torture terrorists.

432
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:35,180
Right?
And the point I make is there's people 

433
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:35,180
right now,
uh,

434
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:35,280
Michael,
Ian Black,

435
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:40,340
or will tell you,
tweet out every day the NRA is a 

436
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:43,251
terrorist organization.
So what happens when the government 

437
00:18:43,251 --> 00:18:44,190
defines you as a terrorist?
And then you're gonna say,

438
00:18:44,191 --> 00:18:49,191
well,
it never happened to me that that's not 

439
00:18:49,191 --> 00:18:49,191
how it works.
That's the fear.

440
00:18:49,191 --> 00:18:49,590
So you,
we,

441
00:18:49,591 --> 00:18:54,591
if you're going to have principals,
you have to apply them to people that 

442
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:57,081
you hate.
And Tucker Carlson is hardly some Nazi 

443
00:18:57,081 --> 00:19:00,240
right now.
Tucker Carlson is,

444
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:05,310
if you think that he has ideas that are 
questionable,

445
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:10,520
the solution is to present better ideas 
and to debate him and to go back and 

446
00:19:10,741 --> 00:19:15,741
forth with them.
But Tucker Cross is not leading some 

447
00:19:15,741 --> 00:19:17,751
hate mom.
He's not the centerpiece in 

448
00:19:17,751 --> 00:19:19,620
Charlottesville for the extermination of
the Jews or he's not that radical.

449
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,450
No,
he's just a right wing guy.

450
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:22,220
Well,
what they,

451
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:27,260
what,
what critical theory allows them to do 

452
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:27,260
is to say,
well,

453
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:28,260
you can read between the lines and 
ascribe intent to the person.

454
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,220
Right?
So if you read a book,

455
00:19:29,221 --> 00:19:29,640
you can say,
oh,

456
00:19:29,641 --> 00:19:30,540
this is race because x,
y,

457
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:32,280
and z reason.
So they can easily say,

458
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,510
well,
when he says a,

459
00:19:33,511 --> 00:19:34,680
B and c,
he means x,

460
00:19:34,681 --> 00:19:35,190
Y,
and z.

461
00:19:35,191 --> 00:19:40,191
So these are all dog whistles and you 
can impugn whatever motives you want 

462
00:19:40,191 --> 00:19:40,191
onto a person.
And,

463
00:19:40,191 --> 00:19:42,840
and at that point you could do whatever 
you want and the thing is,

464
00:19:42,841 --> 00:19:47,841
he's a dad,
so not only you have to be comfortable 

465
00:19:47,841 --> 00:19:47,841
with,
with fucking,

466
00:19:47,841 --> 00:19:51,741
with Tucker Carlson's house,
you got to be comfortable with the 

467
00:19:51,741 --> 00:19:51,741
scaring as kids.
Yeah,

468
00:19:51,741 --> 00:19:55,190
exactly.
And I think the history of totalitarian 

469
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:56,400
and totalitarianism shows us,
they're more than happy to sacrifice the

470
00:19:56,401 --> 00:20:01,401
kids to get their goal.
It's just really disturbing to me 

471
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:04,650
because I think these idealistic kids 
who are doing this,

472
00:20:04,651 --> 00:20:09,651
they're mostly young people have a 
fundamental lack of understanding when 

473
00:20:09,651 --> 00:20:12,380
it comes to what violence is,
what causes violence.

474
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:13,770
This is intentional.
And how,

475
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:16,800
how close that scene was to violence.
Yes,

476
00:20:16,801 --> 00:20:18,840
because you do that to the wrong guys 
door.

477
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,620
He's going to come out with a baseball 
bat or a gun and he's going to kill some

478
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:24,500
people or smash some people.
It,

479
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,490
it,
it absolutely can happen.

480
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:29,220
It's not likely to happen with the 
garlic Tucker Carlson.

481
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:34,450
Well,
what if they decided to go after the 

482
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:34,450
wrong general?
Or what if they decided to go after the.

483
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:39,010
I mean,
anything can happen in these situations 

484
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:39,010
and also those people are all going to 
get outed.

485
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:44,390
Once those people are out at the outrage
that they're going to experience is 

486
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:46,140
going to be an handleable,
right?

487
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,140
It's going to be unmanageable.
The

488
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:52,460
the amount of people that are furious at
that group of 20 or what?

489
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:53,830
How many people was it?
No,

490
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,260
it was plenty.
I'm angry.

491
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,270
I mean I'm not going to do anything but 
I'm angry.

492
00:20:58,271 --> 00:20:59,800
I think it was disgusting.
If,

493
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:05,280
if I'm angry,
how many really loosely held people.

494
00:21:05,771 --> 00:21:09,010
People that are just like really barely 
keep it in together already,

495
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:14,150
but here's the scary.
It's not those 20 that aren't going to 

496
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:16,441
have the consequences.
It's going to be people who think like 

497
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:16,441
them who haven't done what they did and 
now it's going to be like,

498
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:17,200
oh,
you agree with this that it's.

499
00:21:17,201 --> 00:21:22,201
I'm going to do it to you.
I think it's going to be them to what's 

500
00:21:22,201 --> 00:21:22,201
going to be both.
Yeah.

501
00:21:22,201 --> 00:21:24,160
I think those people don't understand 
like people are gonna find their names.

502
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:27,130
They're going to find where they live 
and there's going to be people that have

503
00:21:27,131 --> 00:21:30,650
nothing to do with this,
not Tucker Carlson and it's not them and

504
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:33,300
these people are going to seek them out 
and they're gonna.

505
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:38,370
It's gonna get ugly.
You can't just bang on people's doors 

506
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:38,370
like that and scare them.
Right?

507
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:41,560
Because people get furious.
Especially when there's not enough.

508
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:44,560
There's not enough evidence.
This is not a bad guy.

509
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:47,780
Tucker Carlson is not some evil demon.
You know,

510
00:21:47,781 --> 00:21:52,781
like if you.
If you looked at who he is and what he 

511
00:21:52,781 --> 00:21:53,680
said,
if you pulled out the worst shit that he

512
00:21:53,681 --> 00:21:58,681
said and and taken it in comparison to 
the woman that we were talking about 

513
00:21:58,681 --> 00:22:00,010
from Msnbc that's still in the air,
Jordan Reed,

514
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:05,190
who lied about her blog being hacked and
twitter lied just to try to cover up for

515
00:22:07,421 --> 00:22:11,740
the fact that she said some blatantly 
homophobic things in the past and called

516
00:22:11,741 --> 00:22:14,830
it and called him the FBI,
which is fucking insane.

517
00:22:14,831 --> 00:22:19,090
That should be a federal crime.
You removing resources right from people

518
00:22:19,091 --> 00:22:24,091
that are already on very serious cases 
that are already trying to solve real 

519
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,670
real crimes,
save people's lives,

520
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:32,790
save people's safety,
and you're deciding that your job at 

521
00:22:32,981 --> 00:22:36,640
msnbc is more important than that and 
she hasn't even fired.

522
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:38,680
Lauren saw Donald tweeted out not that 
long ago,

523
00:22:38,681 --> 00:22:42,430
something akin to regarding to trump if 
you're interfering with the FBI,

524
00:22:42,431 --> 00:22:44,770
that should be a federal crime,
and I said she works down the hall.

525
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:47,500
This,
he's a coworker.

526
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,110
It's like,
what are you talking about?

527
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:54,010
But because she's African American,
people just stepping away from it.

528
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,530
They're letting it go because they don't
want to be called racist.

529
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,690
I don't know if it's that so much as 
people cover their own.

530
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,700
It's a little bit of that,
but they don't always cover their own.

531
00:23:01,701 --> 00:23:03,970
They got rid of Al Sharp.
Not Al Sharpton.

532
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,060
Al Franken,
they got rid of him pretty quick,

533
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:09,820
but that's the senate I'm talking about.
Like you're still left wing.

534
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,630
Oh yeah,
yeah,

535
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,510
that they're covered.
They're on all men.

536
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:13,500
MSNBC,
people.

537
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:14,540
Yeah,
but my.

538
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:19,560
My point is like the.
I don't know if that lady should be 

539
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:19,560
fired.

540
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,400
I think she should be able to say she's 
sorry for shit that she wrote.

541
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:23,050
That was insensitive.
You know?

542
00:23:23,051 --> 00:23:24,580
I think there's a lot of people like 
that.

543
00:23:24,581 --> 00:23:27,820
Brian Williams guy who was completely 
full of shit is still in the air.

544
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:30,370
You don't just lie once about something 
like that.

545
00:23:30,371 --> 00:23:32,290
It's probably been line his whole life,
but it's,

546
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:35,950
it's the degree of the lie.
It's one thing to say,

547
00:23:35,951 --> 00:23:36,760
okay,
I did this.

548
00:23:36,761 --> 00:23:37,780
I did.
That's not going to be like,

549
00:23:37,781 --> 00:23:39,100
you know,
I was getting shot at.

550
00:23:39,101 --> 00:23:41,020
It's like,
I can't imagine.

551
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,460
I was just talking about lack of 
empathy.

552
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:46,220
I can't imagine being in a situation 
where I'm on television and I'm saying

553
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,990
things that are so removed from the 
truth,

554
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,030
right?
Like I,

555
00:23:49,031 --> 00:23:50,380
I can't wrap my head around that.
Well,

556
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:53,320
Hillary did the same thing,
but she's a congenital iris as a.

557
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,430
She was referred to by the New York 
Times back in the day

558
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:56,820
and,
and rightly so,

559
00:23:56,821 --> 00:23:58,440
but she.
People forget this.

560
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:01,080
She did talk about a firefight that she 
was in.

561
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:04,650
It was under sniper fire and the worst 
thing about that that people didn't give

562
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:06,030
a shit about,
she said when she was in Boston,

563
00:24:06,031 --> 00:24:07,290
she was under sniper fire.
It's like,

564
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:12,560
wait a minute.
We were throwing the secret service and 

565
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,111
the bus because what kind of secrets 
surface is going to let the first lady 

566
00:24:15,111 --> 00:24:18,420
run under sniper fire and there has been
and she just basically did a double talk

567
00:24:18,421 --> 00:24:23,421
around that,
but she's got a lot of whoppers in her 

568
00:24:23,421 --> 00:24:23,421
name.
She said she was named after Hillary,

569
00:24:23,421 --> 00:24:27,320
Edmund Hillary.
Even though he climbed Mount Everest 

570
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:27,320
after she was born.
So she's,

571
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:27,320
she's,
I mean,

572
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,200
amazing.
I love that woman.

573
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,950
I love her so much.
She's the funniest person on earth.

574
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,560
She's a scary lady.
She's like a slinky.

575
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:36,300
She's always falling down the stairs.

576
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:37,500
Ah,
yeah.

577
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,300
She's the human slave called dare you.
Yeah,

578
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:41,400
she's a.
it's an odd duck.

579
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:46,470
It's,
it's one of those things where women 

580
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:47,400
want a woman to be president so bad.
They want one for the team so bad.

581
00:24:47,401 --> 00:24:52,401
And then there's so many people from the
left thinks she has the best chance of 

582
00:24:52,401 --> 00:24:54,000
beating trump or whoever is on the right
that they want her so bad.

583
00:24:54,001 --> 00:24:55,680
They're,
they're willing to exonerate her.

584
00:24:56,250 --> 00:25:01,250
So many different horrendous things.
And one of the things I always point 

585
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:01,440
out,
like people want to talk progressive,

586
00:25:01,441 --> 00:25:02,340
they want you want,
you want to talk,

587
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,290
you know,
being left wing.

588
00:25:04,291 --> 00:25:08,850
And she didn't even believe in gay 
marriage until 2013

589
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:14,140
best part was she was on NPR,
which is this far left far right fringe 

590
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:14,140
organization,
right?

591
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,130
NPR,
Terry Gross.

592
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:18,580
And Terry Gross says,
used to be against gay marriage.

593
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:19,810
You know,
your husband passed Doma,

594
00:25:19,811 --> 00:25:24,811
which made it a federal law that gay 
marriage won't be recognized by the 

595
00:25:24,811 --> 00:25:24,811
government.
Uh,

596
00:25:24,811 --> 00:25:24,811
and you change your position.
Like,

597
00:25:24,811 --> 00:25:29,460
how did that happen?
Was it because Americans became a 

598
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:29,460
hillary?
He's like,

599
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:29,460
well,
America changed their point of view.

600
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:29,460
She goes,
no,

601
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:34,080
no,
I understand Americans change their 

602
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:34,080
point of view.
What was your mental process?

603
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:34,180
And she goes,
no,

604
00:25:34,181 --> 00:25:37,480
Terry,
you're saying that I changed my mind for

605
00:25:37,481 --> 00:25:39,930
political purposes and that's not true.
And I,

606
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:42,940
she starts yelling at her and it's like,
Holy Shit,

607
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:47,941
you're at NPR and you think they're too 
right wing for you because they're 

608
00:25:47,941 --> 00:25:47,941
calling you out on your bullshit.
You fucking loon.

609
00:25:47,941 --> 00:25:52,320
But the worst part is,
I had one Ito Broderick on my show two 

610
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,020
weeks ago and she's the one who accused 
Clinton of raping her.

611
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:56,440
And I asked her who was worse,
Clinton or Hillary?

612
00:25:56,441 --> 00:25:57,100
She said,
Hillary.

613
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:00,280
She said she's the one who knew what was
going on and let them get away with it.

614
00:26:00,281 --> 00:26:02,410
So that was scary to hear.

615
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:06,640
Wow.
The thing that got me was when they were

616
00:26:06,641 --> 00:26:09,460
confronting bill recently about Monica 
Lewinsky,

617
00:26:09,461 --> 00:26:11,830
and they asked him,
do you owe her an apology?

618
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:13,010
Right?
And he was like a bed.

619
00:26:13,011 --> 00:26:15,280
But if things that I got out of that 
free,

620
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:17,500
your crazy.
Let me tell you something that I was.

621
00:26:17,501 --> 00:26:19,790
I left the White House millions dollars 
yet.

622
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,430
And he stole the furniture and they have
to return it.

623
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:24,750
And they stole the show.
They looted the White House.

624
00:26:24,751 --> 00:26:25,980
They have to return all the shit they 
stole.

625
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:28,170
Come on.
There's a book called final exit written

626
00:26:28,171 --> 00:26:29,760
by Barbara Olson who died in nine slash 
11,

627
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:31,650
and it's all about they fucking stole 
everything.

628
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:36,770
Really.
All the staff also popped out all the 

629
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:36,770
w's of the keyboards.

630
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:37,210
So the George Bush office,
people could use them.

631
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:39,650
Yeah,
they went out there like assholes.

632
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,190
They pop it up.

633
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:47,970
That's actually kind of.
That was actually kind of funny.

634
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:49,380
That's a.
that's a a good little.

635
00:26:49,381 --> 00:26:50,390
Fuck you.
Yeah,

636
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:55,550
but the idea that this guy would in 
especially in today's political climate 

637
00:26:56,431 --> 00:27:01,431
and dealing with me too and all the 
various scandals that have been going 

638
00:27:01,431 --> 00:27:06,201
on,
rapist exposed that this guy who if all 

639
00:27:06,201 --> 00:27:11,181
that shit was going on today with the 
likely either be under indictment or at 

640
00:27:11,181 --> 00:27:14,970
the very least under heavy investigation
for sexual assault,

641
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:20,560
but because it's so long ago,
it seems to be like this weird sort of 

642
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,050
gray area that he's saying,
I don't know what her.

643
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:27,140
An apology you if things that I wasn't 
punished like you weren't punished,

644
00:27:27,211 --> 00:27:30,240
like you're worth hundreds of millions 
of dollars now.

645
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:32,970
How?
How are you worth so much money now?

646
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,190
One of the greatest things I remember at
the time,

647
00:27:35,191 --> 00:27:40,191
this has been forgotten,
the press likes to throw this under the 

648
00:27:40,191 --> 00:27:40,191
rug,
sweep it under the rug.

649
00:27:40,191 --> 00:27:41,160
They said at first and Monica Lewinsky 
was a stocker.

650
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,340
All of Clinton's goons had gotten the 
news channels at the time.

651
00:27:44,341 --> 00:27:46,110
Say she's a lunatic,
she's a stalker.

652
00:27:46,111 --> 00:27:51,111
They never had an affair,
and you're sitting there and she's like 

653
00:27:51,111 --> 00:27:53,271
23.
How the fuck do you stuck a precedent 

654
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:53,310
that that doesn't make any sense.
If it wasn't for that dress,

655
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:55,710
let's keep that in mind.
If she didn't have physical evidence,

656
00:27:56,130 --> 00:28:01,130
nothing would have happened to him and 
she would be regarded as a loon to this 

657
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:02,900
day and she be treat a complete pariah.
They were ready,

658
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,190
would have never went public with it.
It was that other lady.

659
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,530
She was forced her to go pump.
No,

660
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,470
no.
Ken Starr found her and he.

661
00:28:08,471 --> 00:28:09,810
He subpoenaed her.
Yeah,

662
00:28:09,811 --> 00:28:11,580
but it was because of that woman,
Linda Tripp,

663
00:28:11,581 --> 00:28:12,270
Linda Tripp,
right.

664
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:15,470
It was her coaxing her to keep the 
treasure,

665
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:20,960
keep the dress,
but go public with this and talk about 

666
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:20,960
it.

667
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:20,960
He was outed by drudge.
Remember,

668
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,520
was that before that,
before Linda Tripp was doing all this 

669
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:25,980
light fixture and the trip was coaching 
her through the whole thing.

670
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:31,010
Linda Tripp was coaching her privately.
This is all private drudge broke it 

671
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:32,430
because the press wasn't covering it and
they didn't know what to do because this

672
00:28:32,431 --> 00:28:34,020
is a big moment internet history where 
they're like,

673
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:38,450
this website is revealing information 
and now we're going to talk about it.

674
00:28:38,451 --> 00:28:43,451
I thought that was also coming from 
Linda TRIPP and I thought Linda tripp 

675
00:28:43,451 --> 00:28:44,700
keeping the conversations.
Linda tripp was taping the conversations

676
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:49,760
and I don't know how.
I know drudge was the one who made all 

677
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,791
the shit public.
Maybe she was being subpoenaed 

678
00:28:52,791 --> 00:28:55,100
privately.
She was going to drudge and she was 

679
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:55,100
leaking and familiar.
Is that true?

680
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,090
Can you look that up?
I don't think Linda TRIPP was linking to

681
00:28:57,091 --> 00:28:58,110
drudge or maybe she was.

682
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:01,050
I thought the story was A.
I don't know though.

683
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:06,140
I thought the story was that she was 
coaching Monica Lewinsky and trying to 

684
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:06,930
get her to go public with it.
That's possible,

685
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:10,770
but Monica didn't go public force 
throughout the class and she also did it

686
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:13,620
without Monica's consent.
As far as the record.

687
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:15,120
That was true and she went to jail for 
it.

688
00:29:15,121 --> 00:29:17,630
Didn't she or she was at least arrested.
Something happened.

689
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:22,680
Yeah,
she was already at very least arrested 

690
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,850
for recording and I consent to.
My point was like him sat on television,

691
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:29,090
like the lack of insight,
the lack of objectivity is his lack of 

692
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:33,720
personal objectivity that he's getting 
asked this question,

693
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:36,900
do you or apology that he can't say,
look,

694
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,670
I made a mistake.
I shouldn't have done it.

695
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:43,700
Right.
It was a bad thing to do and especially 

696
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:46,080
bad thing to do to a 20 year old girl 
and have her exposed like that as close 

697
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:46,080
to my daughter's age.

698
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,360
Yeah,
and for him to not say that is like some

699
00:29:49,361 --> 00:29:51,570
serious sociopathic shit involved in 
this.

700
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:53,320
He's never.
I mean that's his ammo.

701
00:29:53,321 --> 00:29:54,490
He never ever will.
Also,

702
00:29:54,491 --> 00:29:56,860
if you're apologizing there,
you probably legally culpable.

703
00:29:56,890 --> 00:30:01,890
Right.
Because they were going to get him for 

704
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:01,890
perjury.
So Paul and apologies,

705
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:02,110
that acknowledgement possibly from 
Miami,

706
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,700
they pulled this legal license because 
of this.

707
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:05,770
That was part of the deal and left the 
White House.

708
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:08,140
That's right.
That's right.

709
00:30:08,141 --> 00:30:10,090
I forgot about that.
Yeah,

710
00:30:10,091 --> 00:30:11,350
the whole thing's a mess.
And then.

711
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:16,000
And then when Hillary is asked about it,
was that a some sort of abuse of power?

712
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:17,110
She's like,
no,

713
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:19,420
because they're adults.
Monica Lewinsky was an adult.

714
00:30:19,421 --> 00:30:22,990
Choose a comparison to like fucking 
president.

715
00:30:22,991 --> 00:30:26,170
So the only time there's an abusive 
power is when children are involved.

716
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:27,910
Like what the fuck are you talking 
about?

717
00:30:27,911 --> 00:30:29,500
It's crazy.
That makes no sense.

718
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:34,530
But not only that,
that is the biggest is the between an 

719
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:35,980
intern and the later of the world.
Right.

720
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,200
I mean there's no bigger gap,
right?

721
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:41,290
Forget about like studio executive and 
actress,

722
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:43,210
you know,
like that's,

723
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:48,300
that's tiny in comparison to the leader 
of the world and an intern.

724
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:51,520
And at the time all the feminist ran 
interference for him.

725
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,350
The only one who did it was the craziest
one.

726
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:55,360
Andrea dworkin.
And she goes,

727
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:57,720
we know he's a rapist,
Bernita Broderick.

728
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,860
We know that this was sexual harassment,
assault,

729
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:04,980
sexual harassment,
and everyone's covering for him and you 

730
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:05,140
guys are being complete hypocrites.
It's crazy.

731
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:07,180
It's crazy.
They're willing to do that.

732
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:09,130
It's tribalism.
I know,

733
00:31:09,131 --> 00:31:13,300
but it's so fascinating when you see it 
so blatant and so obvious,

734
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,510
but I mean you see it from the right.
I mean she will experience for them.

735
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,390
Oh yeah.
It's,

736
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:18,760
I mean it's.

737
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:21,040
I think it's the human mind convinced it
itself.

738
00:31:21,041 --> 00:31:22,690
It makes double standards.
If I hate you,

739
00:31:22,691 --> 00:31:25,270
I'm willing to believe I know have been 
studies about this.

740
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:30,390
If I hate you,
I'm willing to believe something 

741
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:30,390
negative about you.
If I like you,

742
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:32,200
I'm willing to believe a compliment 
about you and a more resistant to,

743
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:34,240
to a hearing,
something negative about.

744
00:31:34,241 --> 00:31:39,241
Yes.
And that's just how our brain filters 

745
00:31:39,241 --> 00:31:39,241
things.
Sure.

746
00:31:39,241 --> 00:31:39,241
I mean,
we're all guilty of it.

747
00:31:39,241 --> 00:31:40,450
I'm guilty of it with my friends for 
sure.

748
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:42,550
You know,
if someone's mad at my friends,

749
00:31:42,551 --> 00:31:43,270
I'm like,
listen,

750
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:45,400
it's nothing I can tell you.
Right?

751
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,030
Like,
yeah,

752
00:31:46,031 --> 00:31:49,210
I had seven trying to talk shit on one 
of my friends and I said,

753
00:31:49,211 --> 00:31:51,370
there's nothing you can say that's 
gonna.

754
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:54,430
Make me throw him under the bus to you.
Yeah.

755
00:31:54,431 --> 00:31:55,930
So you,
you're just wasting your breath.

756
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:57,900
Yeah.
There's certain friends like yeah,

757
00:31:57,910 --> 00:31:59,020
they,
they might fuck up,

758
00:31:59,021 --> 00:31:59,890
but they're still my friends.

759
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:00,910
Yeah,
just to.

760
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:01,960
I'm not,
I'm not hearing it.

761
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:04,930
Yeah.
And that's people I know really well.

762
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:07,920
The real problem with this whole tribal 
thing is like it,

763
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:12,930
it seems to me when it comes to the 
political tribes and people are so 

764
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:15,730
invested in winning,
it's so sports like yes,

765
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,950
it's,
it's just so.

766
00:32:17,951 --> 00:32:20,070
It's so strange to see it play out.
It's,

767
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:24,340
it's disturbing to me also that you 
think your life is a function of who the

768
00:32:24,341 --> 00:32:25,420
president is.
Yeah.

769
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:28,600
And it's just like this isn't,
this is everything's things be good.

770
00:32:28,601 --> 00:32:31,570
Things could be bad.
This doesn't affect you directly effects

771
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:32,680
you indirectly.
Yeah.

772
00:32:32,681 --> 00:32:34,750
It affects you,
but yeah,

773
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:39,780
most day to day lives mean hunter.
S Thompson talked about that back the 

774
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:40,760
seventies when he was running for 
Sheriff,

775
00:32:40,761 --> 00:32:41,690
uh,
picking county.

776
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:46,670
He's saying local politics really affect
you,

777
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:52,120
like that's.
That's something that really changes 

778
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:52,120
your life.

779
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,340
It goes,
but the day to day happenings of the 

780
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:57,040
White House,
most of it is just you're fixating on 

781
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:57,470
these things that really are probably 
never going to have any impact,

782
00:32:57,830 --> 00:33:02,690
but local local stuff.
Who's the mayor that has a direct impact

783
00:33:02,691 --> 00:33:07,691
on your life?
What are they going to do with the 

784
00:33:07,691 --> 00:33:07,691
streets?
Well,

785
00:33:07,691 --> 00:33:09,851
it's not only the impact,
it's like how much power do you have to 

786
00:33:09,851 --> 00:33:10,130
effect change at the local level a lot 
at the White House level?

787
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,210
Very little.
Yeah,

788
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:16,480
and we're seeing that,
which is really one of the really 

789
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,271
fascinating things about trump being 
president is how much he's trying to do 

790
00:33:19,271 --> 00:33:23,170
and how much he's not able to do and how
much pushback there is and how much he 

791
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:27,311
is able to do and how much outrage there
is about it and how much chaos is 

792
00:33:27,311 --> 00:33:27,790
surrounding the whole situation.
Yeah,

793
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:33,040
it's fascinating to watch all the safe 
check the checks and balances and the 

794
00:33:33,201 --> 00:33:38,201
safety procedures that are sort of built
into the system of government act out 

795
00:33:38,201 --> 00:33:42,490
and now that like you see the Senate 
controlled by the Republicans and the 

796
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:45,320
house controlled by the Democrats like,
oh Jesus,

797
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:46,880
this is what I was helping for chaos.

798
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:51,940
As much cash as possible.
The shit show and it's going to be more 

799
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:53,120
of a shit show in the house with trying 
to pick Pelosi's number two.

800
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:54,890
Yeah.
Well,

801
00:33:54,891 --> 00:33:57,140
and also to see that trump was saying 
nice things.

802
00:33:57,310 --> 00:34:01,040
Polosi hilarious.
Trolling the fuck at heart woman.

803
00:34:01,041 --> 00:34:03,890
She does a great job.
I think she really loves our country.

804
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,090
Now that you see what she said,
he goes,

805
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:08,300
she deserves to be speaker and if the 
Democrats won't vote for her,

806
00:34:08,301 --> 00:34:10,970
we'll throw her republican votes.
Wow.

807
00:34:10,971 --> 00:34:13,370
He said that he tweeted it out.
Woo.

808
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:18,460
Growing up like I'm just going to press 
some buttons and see what happens.

809
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:20,870
They all freak out.
It's amazing.

810
00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:25,930
It really is funny.
You know what I thought was really 

811
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:28,001
hilarious.
I actually enjoyed it when Alec Baldwin 

812
00:34:28,001 --> 00:34:28,160
got arrested and they said to trump,
you know,

813
00:34:28,161 --> 00:34:30,050
Alec Baldwin got arrested,
how do you feel?

814
00:34:30,051 --> 00:34:32,780
He goes,
I wish them luck and you know how,

815
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:37,870
and I tweeted it out and go,
I bet you see an end is going to say 

816
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:37,870
trump refuses to denounce violence in 
his hometown.

817
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:42,320
That's true.
I mean,

818
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,210
the fact that he's.
He's like,

819
00:34:44,211 --> 00:34:45,110
I wish them luck.
I mean,

820
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,180
look,
he just knocked a home,

821
00:34:47,181 --> 00:34:52,181
run out in the parking lot and smashed 
every window in the car is parked out 

822
00:34:52,181 --> 00:34:56,070
here,
mean with Baldwin getting arrested for 

823
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:57,140
punching someone.
After all those years of him mocking him

824
00:34:57,141 --> 00:35:00,680
on CNN and on a Saturday night live.
It's.

825
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:02,960
But it's the trump curse.
Like everyone who goes after him,

826
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:04,730
you know,
they ended up getting destroyed.

827
00:35:04,731 --> 00:35:05,910
Like Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
I mean,

828
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:07,670
she just fell and broke three of her 
hips.

829
00:35:07,671 --> 00:35:09,230
I hope she gets.
Do you think that's a curse?

830
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:12,050
It's a trump kirby.
The Old Lady just falls down,

831
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:15,890
but the timing of these things are so 
perfect and so like hilariously perfect.

832
00:35:15,891 --> 00:35:20,891
What about stormy Daniels?
Now you've got to pay his legal fees 

833
00:35:20,891 --> 00:35:22,330
like that is kind of hilarious that 
she's going to pay his legal fees.

834
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:27,330
You know,
how much strip and you got to do to pay 

835
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:27,330
those legal fees?
His leg.

836
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:29,660
I don't know.
His legal fees must be through the roof.

837
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:32,060
They're probably millions of dollars.
I'm.

838
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:32,990
Yeah,
it's got be crazy.

839
00:35:32,991 --> 00:35:33,940
Yeah,
right?

840
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:34,610
Sure.
Yeah.

841
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,710
I mean he has an enormous legal team.
They've been.

842
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:39,930
And then how about all these people that
we're going to turn and I'm like Michael

843
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:40,980
Cohen,
now he's fucked.

844
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:43,560
What is he going to do now?
What is he going to say?

845
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,580
You?
Well,

846
00:35:44,581 --> 00:35:48,660
we already know that you paid her off 
and now no one cares because he just won

847
00:35:48,661 --> 00:35:49,470
the case.
Right?

848
00:35:49,471 --> 00:35:53,240
And so she has to pay his legal fees and
now you're stuck with nothing.

849
00:35:53,241 --> 00:35:54,140
You have nothing.
Right.

850
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:56,310
And now he always tried to say a trump 
saying,

851
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,380
I'll trump used racist language with me.
It's like,

852
00:35:58,381 --> 00:35:59,490
really?
Okay.

853
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:02,790
Well they're supposedly that Mike,
Mark Burnett tape.

854
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,160
Okay.
Yeah.

855
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,550
Tom.
Tom Arnold,

856
00:36:05,551 --> 00:36:06,420
trying to find it.
Right.

857
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:08,340
That's the APP.
Mark Burnett,

858
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:11,120
the guy is that Mark Burnett?
The survivor guidance apprentice guy,

859
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:13,060
apparently very religious.
Okay,

860
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:18,110
and he is inclined to support trump's 
positions on many things and he's just 

861
00:36:19,081 --> 00:36:20,130
not going to release that.
No,

862
00:36:20,131 --> 00:36:21,330
no.
There's no way.

863
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:27,220
Trump who is running a TV show.
We look at t look at Megan Kelly joined 

864
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:27,220
reed.
He's.

865
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:30,150
If he's using racial slurs in front of 
cameras and a cast of 50,

866
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:31,830
which I'm sure are going to have people 
of color.

867
00:36:31,831 --> 00:36:34,110
This is New York.
There's no way this wouldn't have leaked

868
00:36:34,111 --> 00:36:36,300
at the time.
That's not true.

869
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,760
If he's using the n word.
That's not true.

870
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:39,720
No.
If there's.

871
00:36:39,721 --> 00:36:44,721
If there is a.
there's a sound guy and there is a 

872
00:36:44,721 --> 00:36:46,700
producer and they're collecting tapes 
and everyone has.

873
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:46,950
No,
no.

874
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,550
If he's doing this publicly in front of 
all,

875
00:36:48,551 --> 00:36:49,680
he's not doing it publicly.

876
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:54,710
He's talking to someone and it was 
recorded much like the billy Bush thing 

877
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:54,710
when he was on the bus.
Right.

878
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:56,760
It's kind of doing it publicly,
but he's talking to somebody.

879
00:36:56,761 --> 00:37:00,120
I thought he was talking to one of the 
cast members supposedly does somewhat.

880
00:37:00,121 --> 00:37:03,480
I heard this tape is big foot,
big foot.

881
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,100
It's like a small,
like hang on 18,

882
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,650
but at the other thing is if he's using 
this language,

883
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:12,680
he would have been using it frequently 
was he does hit certain words over and 

884
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:12,680
over.
Yes,

885
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:16,110
but it could be.
He used it in a very specific way.

886
00:37:16,111 --> 00:37:18,510
Like you know the story about the guy 
from Netflix,

887
00:37:18,511 --> 00:37:23,511
right?
Or here's how about the story about the 

888
00:37:23,511 --> 00:37:23,511
hub of John.
John got.

889
00:37:23,511 --> 00:37:23,730
Yeah,
that's outrageous.

890
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:25,530
We'll we'll explain it to people that 
don't know.

891
00:37:25,531 --> 00:37:30,531
The store was on that conference call 
with a PR firm,

892
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,120
the PR firm,
and he said he was saying,

893
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:37,470
we're not going to be like Colonel 
Sanders saying Blah Blah Blah with the n

894
00:37:37,471 --> 00:37:37,800
word.

895
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:43,310
He was quoting somebody else as an 
example of don't use this kind of 

896
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:43,500
speech.
It's really bad.

897
00:37:43,501 --> 00:37:43,980
And they go,
Oh,

898
00:37:43,981 --> 00:37:45,210
you invoke that word.
You're fired.

899
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:50,730
Literally,
and he is the CEO of the company and 

900
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:52,980
he's saying to them,
we're not going to use these words.

901
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:55,140
We're not going to be like these person.
Like,

902
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,040
it's not like saying Michael Richards.
Like,

903
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:58,920
like if I said that like,
Hey,

904
00:37:58,921 --> 00:38:03,921
I'm not going to be like Michael 
Richards and get on stage in front of 

905
00:38:03,921 --> 00:38:04,290
everybody and drops men bombs and people
just start freaking out.

906
00:38:04,291 --> 00:38:09,291
Joe Rogan just said the warrant and then
all of a sudden that becomes public and 

907
00:38:09,291 --> 00:38:12,120
then I get fired and then youtube pulls 
me off and then itunes pulls me off.

908
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,420
Literally.
That's what it's like.

909
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:18,390
What happened with the Papa John's.
But all anybody hears is the Papa John's

910
00:38:18,391 --> 00:38:20,190
guy said racist shit.

911
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:20,550
No,
no,

912
00:38:20,551 --> 00:38:21,300
no.
That's all they.

913
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:25,050
All they heard was papa John's refused 
to support Colin Kaepernick.

914
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:26,670
And now they're like,
all right,

915
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:28,590
we're gonna get this fucker.
And they did.

916
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,320
That's part of it too,
right?

917
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:31,440
Yeah,
that's part of it too.

918
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,520
Yeah.
There was a,

919
00:38:32,521 --> 00:38:33,400
there was already a,
uh,

920
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:34,510
an agenda,
right?

921
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,400
Because of refusing to support 
Kaepernick.

922
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:39,160
Gee,
this is the whole thing is just,

923
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:41,980
it's the.
And then there's the Netflix guy.

924
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:44,050
Do you know the Netflix Guy?
I don't think I know this one.

925
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:46,120
What is his name?
Well,

926
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:48,580
it doesn't matter.
There's a gentleman who was like,

927
00:38:48,581 --> 00:38:53,581
one of the top dogs at Netflix says,
you shouldn't say the word retard 

928
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:59,970
because two people that have someone in 
their life that has down syndrome.

929
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:03,490
It's like using,
and he doesn't say the n word,

930
00:39:03,491 --> 00:39:08,491
he says nigger in front of African 
Americans and he says this in a room 

931
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,700
filled with people and some of them 
happen to be African Americans.

932
00:39:12,701 --> 00:39:13,750
How many of them were retarded?

933
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:22,380
So they freak out that he's used this 
word saying that it is just as offensive

934
00:39:23,411 --> 00:39:25,140
as using the n word,
but he's.

935
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:28,490
He's a false equivalency.
They're saying like,

936
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,610
this is much worse.
No,

937
00:39:29,611 --> 00:39:29,950
no,
no,

938
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:33,620
no.
He's just using it in terms of saying,

939
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:39,010
this is about my friend Tom,
my friend Tom Segura has a bit in his 

940
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:43,471
last Netflix special and the bit was 
about you can't use the word retarded 

941
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:48,860
and this is what he says,
and he goes into all these different 

942
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:52,171
words that you can't use anymore.
And because he said Tom stole this from 

943
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:54,880
George Carlin.
No,

944
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,810
that's the George Carlin bit though.
How?

945
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,090
What is it?
The seven words.

946
00:39:58,091 --> 00:39:59,560
You can't stand television now.
They've done.

947
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:00,480
Yeah,
it's very,

948
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,790
it's very different when he's saying he 
has a whole,

949
00:40:03,791 --> 00:40:08,791
it's a very good bit,
but it's in no way endorsing using that 

950
00:40:08,791 --> 00:40:09,790
word so.

951
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,530
But the fact that he uttered it out loud
with this guy was saying was this is the

952
00:40:14,531 --> 00:40:18,190
same thing as someone uttering the n 
word out loud,

953
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:21,730
but he didn't say the n word.
He said Nigger,

954
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:26,080
and because he said that they fired him 
from Netflix.

955
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:31,230
Wow.
Literally saying a noise to represent a 

956
00:40:31,961 --> 00:40:35,530
word that's an offensive word,
and this is.

957
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:38,980
They said enough is enough.
You said Abracadabra,

958
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,170
that is gone.
That is a retarded decision.

959
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:45,580
Is it niggardly?
All of they're saving money.

960
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:50,610
That's a different word that people are.
People are saying you shouldn't say to 

961
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:51,400
anymore because it sounds too much like 
the n word,

962
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,230
even though it means stingy.
Right.

963
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,360
Which is very funny.
Oh,

964
00:40:55,361 --> 00:40:56,540
Jesus.
But it's,

965
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,240
it's moises.
It's not.

966
00:40:58,241 --> 00:41:03,241
It's not about intent anymore.
It's just about never been about 

967
00:41:03,241 --> 00:41:03,241
attendance about domination.
Right.

968
00:41:03,241 --> 00:41:05,440
It's always about domination.
That's one thing that Carlin said.

969
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:10,440
That's absolutely correct.
It's political correctness is just 

970
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:10,440
fascism with better language.
Yeah.

971
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:13,090
It's all about domination and telling 
the line and you know,

972
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:16,150
picking off the people that you need to 
pick off and making examples.

973
00:41:16,151 --> 00:41:18,370
I then for everyone else,
yes.

974
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:18,830
What it.
No,

975
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:23,880
he didn't say better language that 
fascism disguised as being polite or 

976
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:27,691
something like that,
but the fact that they felt like it was 

977
00:41:27,691 --> 00:41:31,110
a smart decision to just fire someone 
because he said annoys you should.

978
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,680
What you should say is like,
I understand what you're to say,

979
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,960
but let's just not use that word.
Yeah,

980
00:41:35,961 --> 00:41:39,400
you're right.
Done not no more job.

981
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:41,870
You,
you do bad work.

982
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:43,850
You're done.
No more income.

983
00:41:43,851 --> 00:41:46,160
Public shaming.
Get out of here.

984
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:49,460
And the people that were in the room 
were the ones that turned him in.

985
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:54,700
There were some African Americans 
apparently that heard him say that word 

986
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:56,090
out loud and they just saw it as a green
light and they just went after him,

987
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:56,560
Huh?

988
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:57,860
Well,
I made at the same time,

989
00:41:57,861 --> 00:42:00,110
you have to wonder if those executives 
are living in fear.

990
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:01,760
Of course they said know they're like,
shit,

991
00:42:01,761 --> 00:42:03,370
we better do something really quick 
because now the.

992
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,930
Now we're going to have lawsuits.
There were boycotts and blah,

993
00:42:05,931 --> 00:42:06,320
blah,
blah.

994
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:07,340
Well,
the Roseann thing,

995
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:09,470
they trigger and now do you know how 
much money is that?

996
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:11,390
You can't say anymore.
It sounds too close.

997
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:12,990
That was my last special.
No,

998
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:14,360
you can't say.
Oh yeah,

999
00:42:14,361 --> 00:42:19,361
yeah,
but you can't say that word like it 

1000
00:42:19,361 --> 00:42:19,361
sounds too much.
Like the analyst got to really emphasize

1001
00:42:19,361 --> 00:42:20,630
that the er,
um,

1002
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:23,480
when the Roseanne thing happened and 
they,

1003
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:25,480
they immediately stepped up and you 
know,

1004
00:42:25,481 --> 00:42:27,260
this is a warrant.
We hate racism.

1005
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:31,310
You're fired.
They have lost so much fucking money.

1006
00:42:31,311 --> 00:42:34,220
That show is hemorrhaging money and this
return,

1007
00:42:34,221 --> 00:42:37,310
the connors has done terribly.
The audience,

1008
00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:40,100
not just half the audience,
but half the audience and then shrinking

1009
00:42:40,101 --> 00:42:42,800
every week and it's most likely being 
canceled.

1010
00:42:42,830 --> 00:42:46,730
But this is what I think people don't 
get a ostensibly the point of,

1011
00:42:46,731 --> 00:42:51,250
of businesses to make money.
That's why people go into business for a

1012
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:56,320
lot of people.
It's not the people running these 

1013
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,120
organizations are there to further.
There are cultural ideology.

1014
00:42:57,121 --> 00:43:02,121
Yeah.
So the profit will be secondary to 

1015
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:02,330
cultural acceptance.
Well,

1016
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:05,630
cultural acceptance comes along with 
future profitability.

1017
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:08,660
Yes,
the lack of cultural acceptance could be

1018
00:43:08,661 --> 00:43:10,580
financial devastated.
I think that's,

1019
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:12,230
that's the way they're looking at it,
part of it,

1020
00:43:12,231 --> 00:43:13,490
but part of it there also.
Look,

1021
00:43:13,491 --> 00:43:18,491
if you go to,
if you live in New York and then you go 

1022
00:43:18,491 --> 00:43:21,131
to a lefty school and then you become an
executive and your entire culture is 

1023
00:43:21,131 --> 00:43:22,310
this lefty worldview,
you're gonna think this is how all right

1024
00:43:22,311 --> 00:43:24,530
people,
right thinking people act.

1025
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:29,740
You're going to act in a certain way 
accordingly and not even have 

1026
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:29,740
consideration for any possible other 
side.

1027
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:31,340
That's a good point.
That's a good point,

1028
00:43:31,341 --> 00:43:34,310
but it's fascinating that she was not 
allowed to apologize.

1029
00:43:34,311 --> 00:43:38,780
Roseanne was not allowed to apologize,
but that woman from Msnbc joined was who

1030
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:41,150
said much,
much more awful things.

1031
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:45,980
Roseanne was near.
I think she was hysterical or near tears

1032
00:43:45,981 --> 00:43:49,040
that day because she's like,
I care about the crew.

1033
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:51,410
They're the ones who are getting fucked 
please.

1034
00:43:51,411 --> 00:43:52,700
Like,
I'll do what I want.

1035
00:43:52,701 --> 00:43:53,420
I'm not,
you know,

1036
00:43:53,421 --> 00:43:56,570
and that's why she let the show go on 
without her and she didn't fight it.

1037
00:43:56,630 --> 00:43:57,710
Right.
And,

1038
00:43:57,711 --> 00:43:59,480
and Kudos to her.
Yeah.

1039
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:04,900
She's,
she's a friend of mine and she's an 

1040
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:04,900
awesome person.
She really is.

1041
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:07,920
She adore her.
She's not what anybody is trying to 

1042
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:08,180
paint her out too,
but let's talk about tribalism because I

1043
00:44:08,181 --> 00:44:11,120
remember you remember not that long ago 
when her show was on,

1044
00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:13,460
she had that whole Brouhaha with the 
national anthem.

1045
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:18,820
Oh yeah.
Now the Republicans are out for blood 

1046
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:18,820
and now all of a sudden they love her 
and the memories are very,

1047
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:23,741
very short.
I love her because she's controversial 

1048
00:44:23,741 --> 00:44:23,741
and speaks her mind in both cases.
Well,

1049
00:44:23,741 --> 00:44:28,310
she's also legitimately mentally ill.
Had a terrible car accident when she was

1050
00:44:28,311 --> 00:44:33,311
15 years old.
He was institutionalized in a mental 

1051
00:44:33,311 --> 00:44:33,311
institution for

1052
00:44:33,311 --> 00:44:35,340
nine months afterwards.
Like it has personnel,

1053
00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:37,290
personality,
multiple personality disorder,

1054
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:40,350
trauma induced multiple personality 
disorder,

1055
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:42,600
has been on a host of medications or 
whole life.

1056
00:44:42,601 --> 00:44:47,601
Because of that.
Like my analogy that I say is a asking 

1057
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:51,591
her to behave normally.
It's like asking a person with a broken 

1058
00:44:51,591 --> 00:44:51,591
leg to not limp.

1059
00:44:51,591 --> 00:44:51,650
Yeah.
Well,

1060
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:56,660
and the other one thing against her that
you can say she did accused both her 

1061
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:57,750
parents of molesting her and she laid 
later,

1062
00:44:57,751 --> 00:44:59,050
I don't want to speak for her,
but I think she

1063
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:02,390
track that a little because they denied 
it completely.

1064
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:05,120
I don't remember that,
but I wouldn't be surprised dude.

1065
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:08,480
She got brained by a car when she was 
15,

1066
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:10,300
like smashed.
I did not.

1067
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,350
Some woman was driving through an 
intersection,

1068
00:45:12,351 --> 00:45:17,351
couldn't see because the sun glare in 
the window and clipped her with a car 

1069
00:45:17,351 --> 00:45:18,890
and she was fucked up.
I mean she was,

1070
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:23,980
she went from being a straight a student
to being someone who could no longer do 

1071
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:27,101
math.
She detailed it like really emotionally 

1072
00:45:27,101 --> 00:45:31,080
and very honestly and vulnerably.
She was very vulnerable.

1073
00:45:31,081 --> 00:45:33,020
And in discussing it on my podcast,
it was really good.

1074
00:45:33,070 --> 00:45:33,690
Gary,
she,

1075
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:36,850
she's done such a big heart to eight 
really is very,

1076
00:45:36,851 --> 00:45:40,480
very obvious whenever she talks and 
she's on twitter and she's super funny.

1077
00:45:40,810 --> 00:45:41,230
Uh,
I,

1078
00:45:41,231 --> 00:45:43,500
I mean I'm a big fan of her twitter and 
do it in that

1079
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,710
things that she said about that woman,
you know,

1080
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:50,310
being a marriage of this planet,
of the apes,

1081
00:45:50,670 --> 00:45:53,130
you know,
like not the worst thing to say.

1082
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,740
And The lady looks like the lady from 
the planet of the apes.

1083
00:45:55,741 --> 00:45:59,520
I don't give a fuck what you say that 
does that even though she was black,

1084
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:04,600
I thought that bitch was to write things
that she was Jewish.

1085
00:46:05,451 --> 00:46:08,000
She looks like my sister,
she's running the government,

1086
00:46:08,001 --> 00:46:13,001
she must be Jewish.
I thought the thing that's great about 

1087
00:46:13,001 --> 00:46:13,001
Roseanne is she was on,
I think Tucker Carlson,

1088
00:46:13,001 --> 00:46:13,760
Sean Hannity and she looked and he's 
like,

1089
00:46:13,761 --> 00:46:15,020
do you want to apologize to Valerie 
Jarret?

1090
00:46:15,330 --> 00:46:16,310
She looked the camera.
She goes,

1091
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:18,350
Valerie,
on genuinely sorry,

1092
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:20,720
I did not want to hurt you.
This was not acceptable.

1093
00:46:20,990 --> 00:46:22,820
But I also do think you need a better 
haircut.

1094
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,590
You know,
like she still had a joke in there,

1095
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:30,190
but she's such a sweetheart and,
and I don't think the thing that I have 

1096
00:46:30,190 --> 00:46:34,871
people arguing with me about when I,
Valerie Jarrett was born in Iran and 

1097
00:46:34,871 --> 00:46:34,871
people were like,
well,

1098
00:46:35,390 --> 00:46:36,710
she's not black.
She was born in Iran.

1099
00:46:36,711 --> 00:46:37,390
I'm like,
you know,

1100
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:38,960
black people can give birth in Iran.
Right.

1101
00:46:38,961 --> 00:46:40,360
That's the thing.
And this was rapid.

1102
00:46:40,361 --> 00:46:41,330
They couldn't wrap their heads around 
it,

1103
00:46:41,331 --> 00:46:43,250
that she was black,
but in Iran her parents were American,

1104
00:46:43,330 --> 00:46:43,590
right?

1105
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:44,970
Yeah,
yeah.

1106
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,470
The whole thing's a mess.
But it's also one of those things.

1107
00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:49,790
It's fiercely tribal.
You said before,

1108
00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:54,910
and then our tribe,
the tribe of the left of the tribe of 

1109
00:46:54,910 --> 00:46:54,910
the right,
our tribe is decided.

1110
00:46:54,910 --> 00:46:58,700
Your tribe is it acceptable,
unacceptable.

1111
00:46:58,701 --> 00:47:03,701
And what you've done is just beyond the 
possibility of any sort of apology you 

1112
00:47:04,011 --> 00:47:07,730
need to be removed even at a significant
financial loss.

1113
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:11,180
And apparently the people that were 
responsible for getting her fired,

1114
00:47:11,181 --> 00:47:13,370
one of them has already been removed.
Oh yeah.

1115
00:47:13,550 --> 00:47:18,550
And um,
now they're realizing there was a 

1116
00:47:18,550 --> 00:47:21,161
horrendous decision.
They went from having the number one 

1117
00:47:21,161 --> 00:47:23,060
show on television to having this 
bastard version,

1118
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:25,580
the Hogan family.
It's fucking terrible,

1119
00:47:25,581 --> 00:47:26,630
man.
And nobody wants it.

1120
00:47:27,190 --> 00:47:30,190
So they,
if they just decided bring her back

1121
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:33,550
and she apologized and everyone sued 
that over and look,

1122
00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:36,130
there could be money donated to 
charitable causes.

1123
00:47:36,131 --> 00:47:39,000
It could be a teachable moment or a 
learning moment for,

1124
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:40,570
for everybody,
for the whole country.

1125
00:47:40,571 --> 00:47:42,120
Uh,
a moment also of like,

1126
00:47:42,430 --> 00:47:47,430
like of bonding where we just abandoned 
these ridiculous ideas.

1127
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:49,830
There was an episode I watched the 
series a,

1128
00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:54,990
it was like episode six.
Her neighbors that moved into the house 

1129
00:47:54,990 --> 00:47:57,040
from Lanford were Muslims and Roseanne 
was prejudice.

1130
00:47:57,041 --> 00:47:59,380
And then she realized she was wrong.
There was an episode that's like,

1131
00:47:59,381 --> 00:48:04,381
stop being.
So she's always been very culturally 

1132
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:04,381
left.
Yeah,

1133
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:04,810
she,
she,

1134
00:48:05,830 --> 00:48:08,770
she is in some ways and she's right in 
some ways she's,

1135
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:11,290
she leans right in some ways.
She's very pro Israel,

1136
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:16,750
like super.
So much so that she could have even 

1137
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:16,750
talked about moving to Israel.
Yes.

1138
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:16,750
Yeah.
Because,

1139
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:17,180
I mean,
I think she,

1140
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,420
I think she feels I can't speak for her.

1141
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:21,270
So yeah.
Well the whole.

1142
00:48:21,310 --> 00:48:24,010
But what do you got here?
Jamie is their rating is actually pretty

1143
00:48:24,011 --> 00:48:29,011
good.
It's the number to show overall and ABC 

1144
00:48:29,011 --> 00:48:30,940
and it's their top rated comedy.
It's down from where it was obviously,

1145
00:48:30,941 --> 00:48:34,160
but getting to 10 million.
What are you getting this from?

1146
00:48:34,190 --> 00:48:39,190
We're getting this from vulture.com,
which is a very left leaning show and 

1147
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:40,180
it's probably will go to the title of 
this.

1148
00:48:40,181 --> 00:48:42,490
Go to the title of all TV shows right 
now.

1149
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:45,430
Yeah.
Market brand.

1150
00:48:45,431 --> 00:48:46,350
Good Lord.
What?

1151
00:48:46,351 --> 00:48:47,890
Yeah.
What's that about?

1152
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:50,750
[inaudible] back to life.
Yeah.

1153
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:56,430
But the ratings are significantly lower.
More than 50 percent lower than they 

1154
00:48:56,591 --> 00:48:57,850
were with the other show.
True.

1155
00:48:57,851 --> 00:49:00,370
But it was also extremely an extreme 
hit.

1156
00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:01,660
Right.
But it's the same show,

1157
00:49:01,661 --> 00:49:03,180
Jamie.
Okay.

1158
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:06,460
There's no way you're going to tell me.
Fifty percent is not a problem.

1159
00:49:06,490 --> 00:49:07,630
Yeah,
but that's the problem.

1160
00:49:07,631 --> 00:49:12,631
You reading a spin,
what you're reading is vulture spin on 

1161
00:49:12,631 --> 00:49:12,730
it that says it's not that bad.

1162
00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:15,370
They're circling the wagon.
Not only is it not that bad,

1163
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:18,520
they did 10 episodes,
they ordered an 11th.

1164
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:21,160
That's unprecedented.
What you order is,

1165
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:22,630
look,
when I was on Sitcoms,

1166
00:49:22,631 --> 00:49:24,250
they would do a thing called the back 
nine,

1167
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:29,460
right?
So you would get 13 episodes and they 

1168
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:29,460
would order the back nine,
which would bring you to 22,

1169
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:31,960
which is a full order.
They're not doing a full order.

1170
00:49:31,961 --> 00:49:33,290
This shows dead,
right?

1171
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:35,380
So it ain't good.
And the other thing is,

1172
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:39,790
keep in mind this show is extremely 
expensive because you've got to pay.

1173
00:49:39,791 --> 00:49:42,520
Laurie metcalf was probably the best 
comedic actress out there.

1174
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:46,240
Three hundred thousand.
John Diamond gets more than $300,000.

1175
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:48,080
Given Sarah Gilbert,
he gets more than think.

1176
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:53,120
You've got the others too and have a 
million dollars right away just with 

1177
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:55,690
three members of the cast.
Then you have production fees,

1178
00:49:55,691 --> 00:50:00,691
all these other different fees.
There must be a billion eps in that 

1179
00:50:00,691 --> 00:50:00,691
show.

1180
00:50:00,691 --> 00:50:03,810
It's crazy money.
It's crazy money and it could be the 

1181
00:50:03,810 --> 00:50:05,780
biggest show on television.
If she was still on it and,

1182
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:09,610
and the apology was accepted you,
you're not going to lose viewers.

1183
00:50:09,611 --> 00:50:12,210
They could have easily done an episode 
where they were.

1184
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:15,970
The character did that.
It gets clouded as an asshole.

1185
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:20,971
Yes,
100 percent they could have done it 

1186
00:50:20,971 --> 00:50:23,281
where they're interviewing her outside 
of the polls and she says that TV for 

1187
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:23,960
television.
Yeah,

1188
00:50:24,010 --> 00:50:29,010
they say she says it on television and 
then she gets labeled as a racist and 

1189
00:50:29,010 --> 00:50:30,230
then a bunch of people say what she 
really does look like.

1190
00:50:30,231 --> 00:50:33,460
That lady.
That will be how it had data.

1191
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:36,170
It would end with them coming home.
Dan close the door and goes there.

1192
00:50:36,171 --> 00:50:39,770
She really does look like that the whole
thing.

1193
00:50:39,771 --> 00:50:42,770
But I didn't know she was black and like
how could you not know?

1194
00:50:42,950 --> 00:50:47,950
And then they showed different people 
that look black that aren't black and 

1195
00:50:47,950 --> 00:50:51,581
different people that look white,
but our black pull up Dan Berninia Bon 

1196
00:50:51,661 --> 00:50:53,420
gee.
I know he's on Fox all the time.

1197
00:50:53,421 --> 00:50:55,850
He's Italian and he has to say on 
twitter,

1198
00:50:55,851 --> 00:51:00,851
I'm not black.
I don't know who this guy as you'll see 

1199
00:51:00,851 --> 00:51:03,810
his picture.
It's just like you go to 23 and me 

1200
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:04,190
because I'm Italian too,
but I did my ancestry.

1201
00:51:04,191 --> 00:51:06,440
I'm one point six percent African.
Oh,

1202
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:11,500
okay.
Know which is so much more than 

1203
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:12,560
Elizabeth Warren is Indian.
So much more.

1204
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:13,820
Yeah.
Oh,

1205
00:51:13,821 --> 00:51:15,110
that guy's black.
He's male.

1206
00:51:15,111 --> 00:51:15,890
He's Italian.
No,

1207
00:51:15,891 --> 00:51:16,520
don't.
No,

1208
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:17,990
don't lie to me.
It's true.

1209
00:51:18,050 --> 00:51:22,070
That's a black man.
If that guy just gets at the hair.

1210
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:25,280
Listen Bro.
That guy is so African.

1211
00:51:25,490 --> 00:51:28,190
No,
he's an Italian.

1212
00:51:28,430 --> 00:51:29,510
Well,
listen to Italian.

1213
00:51:29,511 --> 00:51:31,430
First of all,
depending upon what part of it.

1214
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:32,180
The Morris.
Yeah.

1215
00:51:32,330 --> 00:51:33,250
Oops.
Yeah.

1216
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:36,830
I mean he probably had some,
but also Italy,

1217
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:40,610
just if you look at how close Italy is 
to northern Africa,

1218
00:51:40,611 --> 00:51:43,340
it's very close.
Like people just came over.

1219
00:51:43,341 --> 00:51:43,810
They,
they,

1220
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:47,000
they fucking fucked around.
They were real close to each other.

1221
00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:52,210
They got on boats,
they went back and forth at long 

1222
00:51:52,210 --> 00:51:53,480
distance relationships.
I mean the Italians in particular,

1223
00:51:53,481 --> 00:51:55,910
especially northern Africans or an 
African.

1224
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:58,120
They're not black.
They're Middle Eastern.

1225
00:51:58,380 --> 00:51:59,120
Yeah,
right.

1226
00:51:59,121 --> 00:52:00,830
Yeah.
But it is still Africa.

1227
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:01,680
Sure.
Yeah.

1228
00:52:01,710 --> 00:52:06,710
It's African genetics when also Egypt.
Egypt also had a relationship with a 

1229
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:10,370
newbie.
EONS and eons eventually conquered Egypt

1230
00:52:10,371 --> 00:52:11,820
and Ethiopia is too.
Yeah.

1231
00:52:11,970 --> 00:52:14,520
So it's a lot of,
there's a lot of.

1232
00:52:14,650 --> 00:52:17,740
Lot of fucking gone around.
Wait,

1233
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:21,230
so what else were you in your eye?
I'm 99 point eight.

1234
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,990
I need the Jewish or white.
There's like nothing else in there.

1235
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:26,360
I'm,
I'm mostly Italian.

1236
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,160
Um,
and the,

1237
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:32,570
the other percent is Irish,
but it also could be English.

1238
00:52:32,571 --> 00:52:33,440
It's one of those,
you know,

1239
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:35,150
your,
you're but it's Irish,

1240
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:37,270
which is where Rogan comes from.
Um,

1241
00:52:37,370 --> 00:52:42,370
one point six percent African and then I
think there a small amount of Asian in 

1242
00:52:42,370 --> 00:52:44,210
there as well.
No small amount of Asian,

1243
00:52:44,211 --> 00:52:47,720
like one percent plus or minus Asian.
Yeah.

1244
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:48,770
No,
native American.

1245
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:54,080
Yeah.
Unfortunately I love her to still 

1246
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:54,080
probably have more than Elizabeth 
Warren.

1247
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:54,620
The best thing that I.
This boring stuff.

1248
00:52:54,650 --> 00:52:59,650
There's two things I love about that.
She takes this test in secret and of 

1249
00:52:59,650 --> 00:53:00,770
course I wonder why,
but no,

1250
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:02,630
but she took a secret.
Then she revealed it.

1251
00:53:02,950 --> 00:53:04,190
She could have seen the results.
You're like,

1252
00:53:04,191 --> 00:53:06,240
Oh fuck,
I'm not going to talk about this because

1253
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:08,730
she thought it might say zero.
Right.

1254
00:53:08,830 --> 00:53:11,420
And because it said zero,
zero,

1255
00:53:11,421 --> 00:53:13,190
zero point one.

1256
00:53:13,630 --> 00:53:16,310
She was not even native American.
It was South American.

1257
00:53:16,370 --> 00:53:17,600
She did like a,
a,

1258
00:53:17,610 --> 00:53:19,790
like Brazilian jeans or whatever it was.
Next skin genes.

1259
00:53:19,850 --> 00:53:20,690
Is that what it is?
Yes,

1260
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:25,720
it wasn't native American genes,
they didn't find native American DNA to 

1261
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:26,250
match number one the best.
Here's the best part.

1262
00:53:26,430 --> 00:53:31,430
Here's the best part.
Trump per year for two years like 

1263
00:53:31,430 --> 00:53:31,430
Pocahontas,
Pocahontas,

1264
00:53:31,430 --> 00:53:31,890
but guys,
when are you going to take the test?

1265
00:53:32,130 --> 00:53:33,990
She goes,
I took the test by the fuck.

1266
00:53:33,991 --> 00:53:34,800
He goes,
who cares?

1267
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:37,560
Just walks away.
He's like each.

1268
00:53:37,610 --> 00:53:42,610
Well,
she said that he was supposed to pay a 

1269
00:53:42,610 --> 00:53:42,610
million dollars towards charity because 
she took the test,

1270
00:53:42,610 --> 00:53:47,000
but if that's the case and the test 
actually shows South American genetics 

1271
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,330
and not native American church,
well isn't that.

1272
00:53:48,331 --> 00:53:52,110
That's all very squirrely too.
It's like what is native American?

1273
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:57,380
I mean there's,
there's so many similarities between 

1274
00:53:57,380 --> 00:54:00,471
people from Mexico and native Americans,
people from Ecuador and native 

1275
00:54:00,471 --> 00:54:01,200
Americans,
Peru.

1276
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:06,200
I mean there's extreme similarities 
between what we think of as traditional 

1277
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:10,020
native Americans and then people that 
lived in South America and then also the

1278
00:54:10,021 --> 00:54:12,780
actual path that they got here in the 
first place.

1279
00:54:13,230 --> 00:54:16,490
A lot of them have Siberian genetics.
Sciatic,

1280
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:17,100
yeah.
Yeah.

1281
00:54:17,101 --> 00:54:22,101
I mean that's what's really.
Did you know the whole story behind how 

1282
00:54:22,101 --> 00:54:22,101
that got discovered?
No.

1283
00:54:22,101 --> 00:54:25,020
It was a guy who was a mormon,
is about a decade plus ago,

1284
00:54:25,110 --> 00:54:30,110
who was trying to prove this Mormon 
doctrine that Jesus,

1285
00:54:30,490 --> 00:54:34,470
Jesus is lost tribe came the the lost 
tribe of Israel America,

1286
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:37,410
and these were the native Americans,
so this guy,

1287
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:41,430
and this was when DNA tests were 
insanely expensive.

1288
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:46,640
This guy spent a shitload of money to 
try to test native Americans to try to 

1289
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:51,111
find Israel like jeans and he found that
they have Siberian jeans because I came 

1290
00:54:51,451 --> 00:54:56,451
across the bering land bridge,
which was excellent because it really 

1291
00:54:56,451 --> 00:54:58,340
did prove that theory that people did 
migrate on foot through the,

1292
00:54:58,420 --> 00:54:59,610
through the bering land bridge.

1293
00:55:02,730 --> 00:55:06,810
It's just so silly,
but if you look at like,

1294
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:10,650
like native Americans and then you look 
at like some Mexicans,

1295
00:55:10,651 --> 00:55:11,220
you go,
wow.

1296
00:55:11,221 --> 00:55:15,930
That was a distinct similarity between 
these two in terms of their features are

1297
00:55:15,931 --> 00:55:18,480
coloration's like how they looked?
Oh yeah.

1298
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:23,481
I mean they're.
They're going to evolve the similar 

1299
00:55:23,481 --> 00:55:23,481
climates and things like that.
Yeah,

1300
00:55:23,481 --> 00:55:25,230
and I think probably similar origins of 
ancestors,

1301
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:30,680
you know,
and so she's got a point south 

1302
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:31,170
Americans,
she's amazing.

1303
00:55:31,171 --> 00:55:32,970
She's amazing.
I think she's on the spectrum too,

1304
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:38,300
probably,
but the number of percentage that she 

1305
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:42,111
has of this gene is so fucking small.
One,

1306
00:55:42,261 --> 00:55:43,620
1000,
24th.

1307
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:47,670
That is so small.
I'm one point six percent right.

1308
00:55:47,910 --> 00:55:52,910
That's literally like what?
Like ten one hundred times as much as 

1309
00:55:52,910 --> 00:55:52,910
her.
I think she's pointed.

1310
00:55:52,910 --> 00:55:52,910
Oh six.

1311
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:59,150
So you're like 30 times as much as 30 
times as much African as she is native 

1312
00:55:59,150 --> 00:56:02,901
American and.
But yet she used that to get a job at 

1313
00:56:02,901 --> 00:56:05,451
Harvard.
The funny part is she had contributed 

1314
00:56:05,451 --> 00:56:07,950
recipes to a book called Powwow Chow,
not making it up and she signed it.

1315
00:56:07,951 --> 00:56:09,980
Elizabeth Warren Navajo.
But here's the.

1316
00:56:10,170 --> 00:56:12,600
Here's the kicker.
She plagiarize the recipe.

1317
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:14,370
Oh my God,
that's beautiful.

1318
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,950
So not only was he not a fucking native 
American,

1319
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:19,530
it's like a crab salad recipes,
like what native Americans are eating.

1320
00:56:19,531 --> 00:56:22,020
Fucking crab.
The fuck you're from Maryland.

1321
00:56:22,070 --> 00:56:27,070
Yeah,
the Maryland Baltimore runs Tuesday.

1322
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:29,830
So it was Ryan sickler would say,
wow,

1323
00:56:29,831 --> 00:56:32,410
that is crazy.
That is just,

1324
00:56:32,530 --> 00:56:33,410
it's one and.
But,

1325
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:38,440
but again,
because she has potential in terms of 

1326
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:39,850
like she's a strong woman,
she's articulate,

1327
00:56:39,851 --> 00:56:43,300
she's very well educated.
She's been a professional politician for

1328
00:56:43,301 --> 00:56:48,301
a long time.
People on the left are not denouncing 

1329
00:56:48,301 --> 00:56:48,301
her.

1330
00:56:48,301 --> 00:56:48,301
Yes,
they have.

1331
00:56:48,301 --> 00:56:48,400
Oh.
Some people were like,

1332
00:56:48,401 --> 00:56:49,030
okay,
this,

1333
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:50,440
that.
There were articles that go,

1334
00:56:50,441 --> 00:56:55,441
okay,
this did not go as we planned because 

1335
00:56:55,441 --> 00:56:55,441
they were just like this as genetics 
test.

1336
00:56:55,441 --> 00:57:00,271
Yes.
And a lot of people are uncomfortable 

1337
00:57:00,271 --> 00:57:02,401
with her appropriating set asides that 
are for people who are actually 

1338
00:57:02,401 --> 00:57:02,401
suffering minorities.
He'd be like,

1339
00:57:02,401 --> 00:57:02,401
no,
no,

1340
00:57:02,401 --> 00:57:03,100
no,
this is not cool.

1341
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:06,160
So she's gotten pushed back from small 
blogs.

1342
00:57:06,161 --> 00:57:08,030
I'm not seeing this from anything 
mainstream.

1343
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:09,490
Correct.
Because mainstream,

1344
00:57:09,491 --> 00:57:11,010
they're always going to cover for the 
establishment.

1345
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:12,470
That's been 100 percent of the time.
Yeah.

1346
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:14,760
They're going to cover about those blogs
is like,

1347
00:57:14,770 --> 00:57:19,770
a lot of them are basically like Ari 
shaffir refers to him as like college 

1348
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:23,550
papers.
It's like a lot of these blogs or like 

1349
00:57:23,550 --> 00:57:24,880
college student written yet,
but they're often speaking truth.

1350
00:57:24,970 --> 00:57:26,170
Oh yeah.
Well,

1351
00:57:26,171 --> 00:57:31,171
I would hope,
I would hope more would come out and 

1352
00:57:31,171 --> 00:57:31,171
say,
hey,

1353
00:57:31,171 --> 00:57:32,550
you can't say you're native American.
Just like,

1354
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:37,000
like imagine the outrage if I just 
started calling myself African American.

1355
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:38,320
Well,
do you know what?

1356
00:57:38,321 --> 00:57:39,730
Did you see what trump said?
He said,

1357
00:57:39,970 --> 00:57:44,970
well,
I can't call her pocahontas anymore 

1358
00:57:44,970 --> 00:57:44,970
because she's not an Indian.

1359
00:57:45,310 --> 00:57:46,570
And I'm just like,
oh my God,

1360
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:50,980
we're not worthy.
He says some hilarious shit.

1361
00:57:51,030 --> 00:57:52,540
Oh yeah,
he really does.

1362
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:55,570
He really does.
He's fucking funny off the cuff.

1363
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:57,400
Oh yeah.
It really is.

1364
00:57:57,490 --> 00:57:59,650
You know,
and the way he goes after people,

1365
00:57:59,651 --> 00:58:01,240
like,
even though he's the president,

1366
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:04,480
like he still calls people fucking 
losers.

1367
00:58:04,870 --> 00:58:08,200
I mean he's still,
he's still caused them losers on twitter

1368
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:10,800
and goes after them.
The horse face face,

1369
00:58:10,830 --> 00:58:15,830
he called stormy Daniels horseface.
Just think of how repulsive he is 

1370
00:58:16,121 --> 00:58:21,121
physically.
He's fat is faces off fucking hanging 

1371
00:58:21,121 --> 00:58:23,200
off of his bones.
He's got white raccoon eyes,

1372
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:28,320
an orange skin,
and yet he's still will mock stormy 

1373
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:31,540
Daniels and call her horseface.
Someone tweeted out,

1374
00:58:31,541 --> 00:58:34,030
I forgot who,
and I apologize the thing he said,

1375
00:58:34,031 --> 00:58:35,760
they go,
imagine what happens.

1376
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:39,610
That trumps the first person who fucked 
a porn star and she had to brag about it

1377
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:41,710
and then she paid him.

1378
00:58:42,070 --> 00:58:43,800
She has to pay him now.
Yeah.

1379
00:58:43,810 --> 00:58:45,580
Well he did pay her.
Right.

1380
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:50,820
But what he paid her,
what she's going to have to pay him is 

1381
00:58:50,820 --> 00:58:52,680
probably like a factor of three or fours
when you.

1382
00:58:52,690 --> 00:58:57,060
I mean how much more she's going to wind
up paying him for 350 k.

1383
00:58:57,130 --> 00:58:59,050
that's all you asked for it.
Oh,

1384
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:01,770
that's a very reasonable.
And that doesn't even cover her book.

1385
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:04,770
It's probably like he just wants to just
get it.

1386
00:59:04,950 --> 00:59:07,870
Just give me that paper.
Just gave me a little something.

1387
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:10,170
I need a little something from you with 
this.

1388
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:13,180
Let this slide.
I want 300,000.

1389
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:13,920
Yeah.
Yeah.

1390
00:59:13,930 --> 00:59:18,930
That's probably a whole book.
That's probably all the money know she 

1391
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:18,930
got more than 3:50
on positive.

1392
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:19,780
How much she thinks she got from that 
book?

1393
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:22,010
A 750 guess.
Yeah.

1394
00:59:22,011 --> 00:59:23,810
But she's got to pay taxes.
Sure.

1395
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:25,100
I know agents getting 15.

1396
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:30,120
Yeah.
She's probably not even bringing three 

1397
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:30,120
home.
So it's all that money's gone.

1398
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:30,890
Oh yeah.
That's all gone.

1399
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:35,980
All gone.
One hundred percent gone and no one's 

1400
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:35,980
buying that book.
Step four,

1401
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:36,200
get stiffed.
Yeah.

1402
00:59:36,290 --> 00:59:38,450
Nobody gives a shit.
She said it all already.

1403
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:39,830
Like,
I fucked the president.

1404
00:59:39,831 --> 00:59:41,330
That's your book.
Your book is.

1405
00:59:41,331 --> 00:59:42,680
I fucked the president.
Like,

1406
00:59:42,681 --> 00:59:43,720
you know,
here's the funny part with her.

1407
00:59:43,721 --> 00:59:45,040
I do remember this.
People,

1408
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:47,300
she was making fun of his Dick,
like had hit a mushroom deck,

1409
00:59:47,301 --> 00:59:48,260
whatever.
And people were like,

1410
00:59:48,830 --> 00:59:51,380
that's what she said.
And then people were like that,

1411
00:59:51,381 --> 00:59:52,970
you know,
that as fucked up as he is.

1412
00:59:52,971 --> 00:59:55,130
That's body shaming.
You really shouldn't make fun of seven.

1413
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:56,060
And she's like,
you know what?

1414
00:59:56,061 --> 00:59:56,900
You're right.
I'm sorry.

1415
00:59:57,380 --> 00:59:59,940
And then he goes,
hey horseface.

1416
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:03,410
She goes his fucking mushroom deck at 
like the next day she's back on it.

1417
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:04,640
It was amazing.

1418
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:11,620
The fact that he can call her a horse 
face towards his face.

1419
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:12,500
No,
it doesn't matter.

1420
01:00:12,530 --> 01:00:14,010
I know,
but it's just so weird for me.

1421
01:00:14,011 --> 01:00:19,011
Ted Cruz really isn't the unabomber or 
whatever the fuck he said he was going 

1422
01:00:19,011 --> 01:00:19,730
to say that.
That's the name he said.

1423
01:00:19,731 --> 01:00:24,731
He said that shot JFK.
It's fucking.

1424
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:29,460
It's also crazy.
That was the best part.

1425
01:00:29,461 --> 01:00:32,510
So Ted Cruz's what was known as like the
best debater in the Senate.

1426
01:00:32,511 --> 01:00:33,620
He had this Harvard,
Yale,

1427
01:00:33,621 --> 01:00:34,670
whatever,
debating team,

1428
01:00:35,030 --> 01:00:37,280
great debater.
Everyone recognized him with this.

1429
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:39,710
How the fuck do you prep for a debate?
Be Like,

1430
01:00:39,740 --> 01:00:41,640
Oh yeah,
well your Dad Jeff Gfk.

1431
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:42,560
It's like,
what the fuck?

1432
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:44,570
Wait what?
Fuck.

1433
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:47,390
Well,
it didn't have to make sense.

1434
01:00:47,391 --> 01:00:48,040
Right?
People,

1435
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:50,450
people that are trump supporters don't 
want it to make sense.

1436
01:00:50,451 --> 01:00:51,980
They just want them to win.
Right,

1437
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:53,390
right.
Exactly.

1438
01:00:53,391 --> 01:00:54,560
And it works.
Yes.

1439
01:00:54,740 --> 01:00:54,970
Yeah.

1440
01:00:55,070 --> 01:00:57,230
Well he just had a good zingers in.
Oh yeah,

1441
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:59,180
yeah.
I mean it's like roast battle more than.

1442
01:00:59,770 --> 01:01:02,060
And they don't get that.
There was this girl my favorite tweet of

1443
01:01:02,061 --> 01:01:02,870
his,
my favorite,

1444
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:06,590
where he goes whenever I speak of the 
losers and the haters,

1445
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,010
I do so with great affection.
It's not their fault.

1446
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:13,850
They were born fucked up.
That's a real trump tweet.

1447
01:01:13,860 --> 01:01:18,690
It's the,
you know,

1448
01:01:18,860 --> 01:01:22,670
one of my favorite things was him at a 
speech where he was talking.

1449
01:01:22,730 --> 01:01:27,380
It was 2015 before you even talked about
running for president or he was even.

1450
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:32,800
I don't think he was 100 percent open 
about running for president and he said,

1451
01:01:33,321 --> 01:01:35,960
there's two ways to talk to China.
You could,

1452
01:01:35,990 --> 01:01:38,270
you could propose things,
you could propose things,

1453
01:01:38,271 --> 01:01:39,170
and he says it like,
you know,

1454
01:01:39,171 --> 01:01:40,100
normally,
and then he says,

1455
01:01:40,101 --> 01:01:41,360
or you could say,
listen,

1456
01:01:41,370 --> 01:01:41,870
motherfucker.

1457
01:01:43,540 --> 01:01:44,660
Yeah.
You ever heard that?

1458
01:01:44,661 --> 01:01:45,740
No.
Oh my God,

1459
01:01:45,741 --> 01:01:47,080
it's great.
Fucking pull it.

1460
01:01:47,150 --> 01:01:50,720
It's fucking great because everybody 
starts cheering.

1461
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:55,790
Yeah,
because it's so forbidden in this 

1462
01:01:55,790 --> 01:01:56,420
environment wearing an expensive suit.
Standing in front of a podium.

1463
01:01:56,870 --> 01:01:58,160
He says,
or you could say,

1464
01:01:58,340 --> 01:02:03,340
listen,
motherfuckers like this is what we're 

1465
01:02:03,340 --> 01:02:03,340
going to do,
and everybody's tired.

1466
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:08,560
It's so exciting.
It's so much more exciting than Marco 

1467
01:02:08,930 --> 01:02:10,160
Rubio or you know,
someone.

1468
01:02:10,180 --> 01:02:11,020
Boom.
Jab,

1469
01:02:11,330 --> 01:02:15,590
jab is a waste.
Janis and big fat mistake.

1470
01:02:15,630 --> 01:02:17,140
Oh wait,
did it with the fingers.

1471
01:02:18,010 --> 01:02:23,010
I watched those.
Which reach because he kept his waist 

1472
01:02:23,010 --> 01:02:23,190
June of Twenty 15.
Now when he said,

1473
01:02:23,191 --> 01:02:28,191
motherfucker,
when he just just not speech when he's 

1474
01:02:28,191 --> 01:02:28,191
talking about China and he said,
listen,

1475
01:02:28,191 --> 01:02:31,620
you fuckers China China chain.
Yeah.

1476
01:02:31,621 --> 01:02:33,590
That was a thing.
Puerto Rico.

1477
01:02:34,170 --> 01:02:39,170
When Puerto Rico,
I'm announcing a ban on all Muslim 

1478
01:02:39,170 --> 01:02:42,660
immigration and Muslim here.
This is a great.

1479
01:02:42,661 --> 01:02:47,661
Well listen to this because it's 
leadership this time instead of with his

1480
01:02:48,271 --> 01:02:50,650
name and gold,
it's with his words.

1481
01:02:50,660 --> 01:02:53,310
Is this discussing Iraq?
We build a school,

1482
01:02:53,820 --> 01:02:56,340
we build a road.
They blow up the road,

1483
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:59,100
they blow up the school,
we build another school,

1484
01:02:59,101 --> 01:03:00,990
we build another road.
They blow them up.

1485
01:03:00,991 --> 01:03:03,060
We build again.
In the meantime,

1486
01:03:03,090 --> 01:03:07,950
we can't get a school built in Brooklyn 
to the audience approval talking oil.

1487
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:12,030
We have nobody in Washington that sits 
back and said,

1488
01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:15,300
you're not going to raise that price.
You understand me?

1489
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:21,180
This is a long time ago saying Chinese 
goods and your mother.

1490
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:26,720
We're going to tax you at 25 percent 
while poles 11.

1491
01:03:26,860 --> 01:03:29,130
Is that what it says over there?
At least when it's posted,

1492
01:03:29,170 --> 01:03:31,270
but here's what's interesting.
Notice the person who posted it,

1493
01:03:31,271 --> 01:03:36,271
their name is say no to racists.
Oh yeah.

1494
01:03:39,341 --> 01:03:41,350
They probably put it up as a negative 
thing.

1495
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:41,800
Well,
no,

1496
01:03:41,801 --> 01:03:46,801
2011.
He would have been considered a 

1497
01:03:46,801 --> 01:03:46,801
Democrat,
right?

1498
01:03:46,801 --> 01:03:46,801
Oh No.
He's endorsed Romney.

1499
01:03:46,801 --> 01:03:47,650
He dressed Romney.
Republican budget.

1500
01:03:47,690 --> 01:03:49,570
Regardless of race,
he was a Democrat until what?

1501
01:03:49,571 --> 01:03:54,571
Twenty 10 probably around then because 
he was gonna run as an independent at 

1502
01:03:54,571 --> 01:03:54,571
some point.
Trump 2012.

1503
01:03:54,571 --> 01:03:55,690
Look at that.
This is the guy we've been looking for.

1504
01:03:56,030 --> 01:03:57,400
Wow.
Seven years ago,

1505
01:03:57,790 --> 01:04:00,910
but it's just deplorable.
Changed it.

1506
01:04:00,911 --> 01:04:04,270
They probably wouldn't be good.
Changed it in the future because it says

1507
01:04:04,271 --> 01:04:05,210
seven years.
Yeah.

1508
01:04:05,260 --> 01:04:08,080
Fuck that traveler deplorable.

1509
01:04:08,110 --> 01:04:09,820
That's the time travel that had joined 
read.

1510
01:04:10,630 --> 01:04:11,270
Uh,
yeah.

1511
01:04:11,271 --> 01:04:13,300
Someone did it.
Someone definitely hacked it.

1512
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:15,790
Yeah,
just hilarious.

1513
01:04:15,910 --> 01:04:19,000
They didn't give the good version of 
that either because they believed it.

1514
01:04:19,180 --> 01:04:24,180
Well not just that,
because he also see if you can find the 

1515
01:04:24,180 --> 01:04:25,030
better version because he,
he basically prefaces it like,

1516
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:27,250
you know,
people have been saying it like this,

1517
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:32,360
right?
You could say it like this or you can 

1518
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:32,360
say,
listen you motherfuckers.

1519
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:33,130
And that's when everybody starts 
cheering.

1520
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:37,360
He actually gave an example of how he 
actually go ahead.

1521
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:39,150
What can you do?
Yeah.

1522
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:44,320
So easy.
I'm dropping 25 percent tax on and you 

1523
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:52,800
know,
I said to somebody that is really the 

1524
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:52,800
Messenger.
The Messenger is important.

1525
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:56,400
I could have one man say,
when did he text you?

1526
01:04:56,450 --> 01:04:59,330
Twenty five percent and I can say 
another.

1527
01:05:00,890 --> 01:05:01,640
Listen,
you mother.

1528
01:05:08,260 --> 01:05:12,200
I know he wouldn't have the press lies 
on the campaign trail.

1529
01:05:12,201 --> 01:05:14,480
He said a point.
I remember what it was.

1530
01:05:14,481 --> 01:05:17,240
The sense that he goes,
you better shut your mouth.

1531
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:18,010
So he didn't

1532
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:23,010
say the word [inaudible].
They bleeped it and they believed it to 

1533
01:05:23,010 --> 01:05:23,560
make it look like he was cursing.
And he's like,

1534
01:05:23,561 --> 01:05:26,410
you guys are fucking shady as hell.
That's very shady.

1535
01:05:26,650 --> 01:05:27,540
Yeah,
that's true.

1536
01:05:27,910 --> 01:05:32,910
You can't just bleep a pause and pretend
that there's some sort of on the fence 

1537
01:05:32,910 --> 01:05:32,910
of word in there.
Right.

1538
01:05:32,910 --> 01:05:35,200
So that's really,
that's just deceptive.

1539
01:05:35,230 --> 01:05:36,910
Right?
And it's pervasive.

1540
01:05:37,270 --> 01:05:40,300
They do it all the fucking time.
Well,

1541
01:05:40,301 --> 01:05:43,480
who's good out there to challenge him?
They're fucked.

1542
01:05:44,710 --> 01:05:46,180
Fuck.
You know why they're fucked.

1543
01:05:46,570 --> 01:05:48,370
Because we've never had this happen 
before.

1544
01:05:48,580 --> 01:05:53,580
The whole time.
All those Democrats are fighting each 

1545
01:05:53,580 --> 01:05:53,580
other for the primary,
for the nomination.

1546
01:05:53,580 --> 01:05:53,950
He's going to be tweeting the shit out 
of those debates.

1547
01:05:53,980 --> 01:05:57,070
He's going to be live tweeting the 
debates and they're not going to have to

1548
01:05:57,130 --> 01:05:59,110
worry about the tax from their 
colleagues,

1549
01:05:59,260 --> 01:06:01,520
but also from the sitting precedent was 
like,

1550
01:06:01,830 --> 01:06:06,830
look at this dope and he's going to come
up with nicknames for them in the stick.

1551
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:08,530
Denang Dick.
He already did.

1552
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:09,580
Oh my.
It's amazing.

1553
01:06:09,750 --> 01:06:11,110
Bang.
Dick Dick Blumenthal.

1554
01:06:11,111 --> 01:06:13,720
Senator from Connecticut,
lied about his Vietnam Service.

1555
01:06:14,660 --> 01:06:18,340
Has started calling him Denang Dick.
He lied about his Vietnam Service.

1556
01:06:18,341 --> 01:06:19,060
They've got elected.

1557
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:21,160
Whoa,

1558
01:06:22,530 --> 01:06:23,370
shameless.
Yeah.

1559
01:06:23,730 --> 01:06:24,900
How did he lie?
What did he say?

1560
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,750
He said he served and he didn't look it 
up.

1561
01:06:27,870 --> 01:06:28,580
Yeah,
I mean it's,

1562
01:06:28,590 --> 01:06:29,820
it's,
it is brazen.

1563
01:06:29,821 --> 01:06:31,660
It wasn't some ambiguous area.
I think he's like,

1564
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:33,480
he never left America as my 
understanding.

1565
01:06:34,510 --> 01:06:36,570
Oh yeah.
And he said he was in nom.

1566
01:06:36,780 --> 01:06:38,610
Oh yeah.
And then he's fucking going after Kevin.

1567
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:40,070
Oh

1568
01:06:40,450 --> 01:06:42,250
God.
How does he get away with it?

1569
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:43,600
But how do they all get away with,
uh,

1570
01:06:43,601 --> 01:06:48,601
Dennis Hastert was speaker of the house.
Dennis Hastert was speaker of the house 

1571
01:06:48,601 --> 01:06:49,960
and he fucked how many kids?
I mean the wrestling team.

1572
01:06:49,990 --> 01:06:52,450
And he only went to jail for 15 months 
for it.

1573
01:06:52,540 --> 01:06:53,500
Yeah.
Yeah.

1574
01:06:53,501 --> 01:06:58,501
He went to jail for 15 months because of
the statute of limitations or something 

1575
01:06:58,501 --> 01:06:58,501
ridiculous.
Well,

1576
01:06:58,501 --> 01:06:59,710
I think then you go to jail for lying 
about paying them off.

1577
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:00,480
I said,
yeah,

1578
01:07:00,940 --> 01:07:01,750
yeah.
That,

1579
01:07:01,810 --> 01:07:06,810
that isn't saying he's out now,
which is just insane and it's no one 

1580
01:07:06,810 --> 01:07:10,831
talks about him,
which leads me to think there's plenty 

1581
01:07:10,831 --> 01:07:10,831
of this and both sides of the aisle.
Well,

1582
01:07:10,831 --> 01:07:11,610
there must be.
He must know where the bodies,

1583
01:07:11,620 --> 01:07:13,120
right?
Of course you're speaker of the house.

1584
01:07:13,300 --> 01:07:15,160
They just got to.
They're just going to say,

1585
01:07:15,161 --> 01:07:16,030
listen,
15 months,

1586
01:07:16,031 --> 01:07:17,070
not that big a deal with Russia.

1587
01:07:17,110 --> 01:07:18,610
Cakewalk in jail.
It's okay,

1588
01:07:18,611 --> 01:07:21,060
we'll get your books.
It'll be fine.

1589
01:07:21,660 --> 01:07:24,510
That's as foreign.
And one will not only that,

1590
01:07:24,511 --> 01:07:27,220
like when did he stop fucking kids?
Right.

1591
01:07:27,221 --> 01:07:29,080
That's the real question because that 
is,

1592
01:07:29,300 --> 01:07:32,020
that's a sickness that just doesn't get 
cured.

1593
01:07:32,110 --> 01:07:37,110
Right.
It's not like quitting cigarettes or 

1594
01:07:37,110 --> 01:07:39,661
something like that.
The recidivism rate for people that are 

1595
01:07:39,661 --> 01:07:40,120
molesters is insanely high.
Right.

1596
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:42,610
So who knows.
Look,

1597
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:46,080
that was one of the creepier things.
That was it.

1598
01:07:46,081 --> 01:07:47,260
Drudge.
That said,

1599
01:07:47,530 --> 01:07:49,470
or was it Breitbart?
That's,

1600
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:51,820
I think it was bright.
That said before he died,

1601
01:07:52,210 --> 01:07:53,720
where he's talking about Podesta.
I.

1602
01:07:53,740 --> 01:07:57,670
This was the one issue I had with legal 
from my forthcoming book because I,

1603
01:07:57,710 --> 01:08:02,710
because drudge said how the tweets still
up dried says how John Podesta is not 

1604
01:08:03,551 --> 01:08:08,551
known as an international like child 
Marissa coverup or completely eludes me 

1605
01:08:08,551 --> 01:08:10,180
and no one said anything at the time.
It wasn't a big deal.

1606
01:08:10,181 --> 01:08:14,440
Podesta never sued and what he might 
have been referring to is Robert Epstein

1607
01:08:14,460 --> 01:08:16,280
with pedophile island where

1608
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:18,710
guys all go to like Jeff Epstein.
Excuse me.

1609
01:08:18,711 --> 01:08:19,530
Jeff Epstein.
Yeah.

1610
01:08:19,780 --> 01:08:24,780
To go that island Clinton's gone like 
nine times and you fuck all these 

1611
01:08:24,780 --> 01:08:28,211
underage girls,
but then they took it to be as proof of 

1612
01:08:28,211 --> 01:08:28,340
pizza gate or something like that.
Yes,

1613
01:08:29,030 --> 01:08:34,030
but here's the thing.
Here's Breitbart or wasn't breitbart 

1614
01:08:34,030 --> 01:08:34,090
entered bipolar tweet,
but if you look at drudge,

1615
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:35,450
Breitbart,
drudge,

1616
01:08:36,050 --> 01:08:37,680
let's Breitbart,
breitbart.

1617
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:38,900
So if I said to Roger,
I apologize,

1618
01:08:39,050 --> 01:08:40,150
just one of those,
but here's,

1619
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:45,640
here's the other thing.
It's that everyone knows historically 

1620
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:49,490
that young women went to Hollywood and 
had to do sexual favors.

1621
01:08:49,530 --> 01:08:51,590
If,
since the twenties in order to get their

1622
01:08:51,591 --> 01:08:52,880
career head right,
this is very known.

1623
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Yeah.
Why wouldn't this happen with young men 

1624
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:58,820
with a older guy executive's why would 
there be any difference?

1625
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,560
Well,
most certainly of course,

1626
01:09:00,590 --> 01:09:01,930
but they like to pretend that,
you know,

1627
01:09:01,970 --> 01:09:02,780
this is all crazy.

1628
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:04,430
It's all a conspiracy.
It's like,

1629
01:09:04,431 --> 01:09:05,030
why,
you know,

1630
01:09:05,031 --> 01:09:06,130
it's true with this one.
Well,

1631
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:10,070
because it's so blatant and it's so 
prevalent that it's horrifying,

1632
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:11,770
right?
Because then it's also the powerless and

1633
01:09:11,771 --> 01:09:12,710
it's like,
what am I going to do about it?

1634
01:09:13,130 --> 01:09:18,130
Yeah.
And just knowing how much it did happen 

1635
01:09:18,130 --> 01:09:20,660
and if they did just uncover every 
single instance of it.

1636
01:09:20,930 --> 01:09:22,430
And that's the other thing.
It's just like with,

1637
01:09:22,460 --> 01:09:23,340
with a,
um,

1638
01:09:23,420 --> 01:09:24,920
Harvey Weinstein,
how everyone knew,

1639
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:27,980
we all knew and they all knew about 
Clinton and all this stuff.

1640
01:09:28,250 --> 01:09:33,250
It's like,
who knows who's a and who's when you're 

1641
01:09:33,250 --> 01:09:34,100
looking up the other way when it comes 
to kids that's so,

1642
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:35,900
uh,
beyond the pale.

1643
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:38,080
Yeah.
Let's start.

1644
01:09:38,081 --> 01:09:39,300
Shit,
it gets very dark there.

1645
01:09:39,301 --> 01:09:42,340
So this Denang Guy,
Denang Dick W,

1646
01:09:42,620 --> 01:09:44,900
he.
So what did he actually say and what was

1647
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:46,490
the.
I don't want to misquote him.

1648
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:47,680
A Dick.

1649
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:51,260
Richard Blumenthal from Connecticut.
How the fuck did he get reelected?

1650
01:09:51,660 --> 01:09:53,570
Connecticut's influenced because it's 
tribalism.

1651
01:09:53,810 --> 01:09:55,730
You're gonna vote blue in Connecticut,
but how would,

1652
01:09:55,790 --> 01:09:58,310
how would they accept him as their 
candidate?

1653
01:09:58,340 --> 01:10:03,340
Because he got.
I think it came out once he was the 

1654
01:10:03,340 --> 01:10:03,340
candidate.
Oh Jesus Christ.

1655
01:10:03,340 --> 01:10:03,950
Yeah,
that's a big one man.

1656
01:10:04,010 --> 01:10:06,650
Yet is so invalid and all that stuff.
I mean,

1657
01:10:06,651 --> 01:10:09,080
forget about what Brian Williams did.
That's way bigger.

1658
01:10:09,100 --> 01:10:12,390
I get shit for having shaved sides of my
hair for like,

1659
01:10:12,470 --> 01:10:13,460
is that the Nazi?
No,

1660
01:10:13,490 --> 01:10:14,780
they're like,
is that stolen valor?

1661
01:10:14,781 --> 01:10:15,680
And I'm like,
no,

1662
01:10:16,430 --> 01:10:17,630
I've got that.
Yes.

1663
01:10:17,690 --> 01:10:21,200
Come on a haircut.
I'm politifact.com

1664
01:10:21,201 --> 01:10:24,080
about it.
He listened to the Marine Corps reserves

1665
01:10:24,081 --> 01:10:28,970
in 1970 and told him five deferments had
kept him out of the war,

1666
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:34,000
getting a coveted slot in the reserves,
reduced the chance of battlefield 

1667
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:37,031
deployment Blumenthal.
Went through basic training and served 

1668
01:10:37,031 --> 01:10:37,700
six years in the Washington dc area in 
Connecticut.

1669
01:10:38,060 --> 01:10:40,010
As Connecticut's Attorney General 
Blumenthal.

1670
01:10:40,011 --> 01:10:45,011
Regularly attended Memorial Day parades 
and other events at recognized soldiers 

1671
01:10:45,011 --> 01:10:46,250
and veterans in New York Times wrote and
May Seventeenth,

1672
01:10:46,251 --> 01:10:51,251
2010 that in 2003 Blumenthal had spoken 
at a rally supporting troops overseas.

1673
01:10:52,130 --> 01:10:56,480
The newspaper reported that Blumenthal 
said when we returned,

1674
01:10:56,510 --> 01:11:01,510
we saw nothing like this.
That was a comparison with soldiers who 

1675
01:11:01,510 --> 01:11:05,441
came back from Vietnam Blumenthal 
repeatedly repeated a similar line in 

1676
01:11:05,441 --> 01:11:07,970
2007 Memorial Day parade in Milford,
Connecticut,

1677
01:11:08,540 --> 01:11:12,170
and at a 2008 ceremony for veterans and 
senior citizens.

1678
01:11:12,171 --> 01:11:14,220
Blumenthal said,
we have learned something

1679
01:11:14,220 --> 01:11:17,310
important since the days that I served 
in Vietnam.

1680
01:11:17,900 --> 01:11:18,260
Ooh,

1681
01:11:18,740 --> 01:11:20,840
Yep.
And now look at the very bottom line.

1682
01:11:20,841 --> 01:11:25,841
Although I did not serve in Vietnam that
I've seen firsthand the effects of 

1683
01:11:25,841 --> 01:11:25,841
military action.
Well,

1684
01:11:25,841 --> 01:11:27,080
that's cool story,
Bro.

1685
01:11:27,170 --> 01:11:28,970
He's a lot you think firsthand mean.

1686
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:31,200
Yeah.
Well that's.

1687
01:11:31,470 --> 01:11:36,470
He said,
we have learned something important 

1688
01:11:36,470 --> 01:11:39,060
since the days that I served in Vietnam.
If they quoted that and that's it.

1689
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:42,450
He said that a 2008 ceremony,
that's a liar.

1690
01:11:42,580 --> 01:11:43,050
Yeah.
I mean,

1691
01:11:43,051 --> 01:11:45,750
that's just that stolen valor,
but you know,

1692
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:46,270
it's,
it's,

1693
01:11:47,510 --> 01:11:51,300
it's a lie as much as it's still invalid
because he does have military service,

1694
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:52,650
which,
you know,

1695
01:11:52,651 --> 01:11:54,060
I mean,
he was a part of the reserves,

1696
01:11:54,061 --> 01:11:55,830
which is an important part of the 
military.

1697
01:11:55,831 --> 01:11:57,450
There's no,
I mean,

1698
01:11:57,451 --> 01:12:02,451
you don't want to diminish that,
but lying about having actually been in 

1699
01:12:02,451 --> 01:12:07,071
Vietnam is,
it's as close to stolen valor you can 

1700
01:12:07,071 --> 01:12:08,640
get with actually being a veteran.

1701
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:09,710
Yeah,
yeah.

1702
01:12:09,740 --> 01:12:11,030
Right.
Yeah.

1703
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:15,110
It's like shady shady,
but they're dirty people.

1704
01:12:15,590 --> 01:12:16,560
They're dirty people.
Yeah,

1705
01:12:16,580 --> 01:12:18,340
of course.
It's a dirty business.

1706
01:12:18,350 --> 01:12:19,730
It's a horrible,
horrible people.

1707
01:12:19,731 --> 01:12:23,950
So that's why when people are like,
venerating these monsters,

1708
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:25,220
I'm like,
what the fuck is wrong with you?

1709
01:12:25,221 --> 01:12:28,310
These people are horrible.
Just doing that.

1710
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:33,080
Just doing that alone.
Like that's what's hilarious that he got

1711
01:12:33,081 --> 01:12:34,520
through though.
Oh yeah.

1712
01:12:35,060 --> 01:12:40,060
It's,
it's funny when people can get away 

1713
01:12:40,060 --> 01:12:40,060
with.
Does he ever said,

1714
01:12:40,060 --> 01:12:40,060
I'm sorry.
Shouldn't have said that.

1715
01:12:40,060 --> 01:12:41,420
What'd he say?
Oops,

1716
01:12:41,421 --> 01:12:45,760
I did it again.
Made mistakes and I have.

1717
01:12:46,220 --> 01:12:46,530
I have

1718
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:50,890
spoken about my service and I regret 
that and I take full responsibility.

1719
01:12:51,060 --> 01:12:52,830
You know,
full responsibility means resigning.

1720
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:54,400
Does it?
If you're taking,

1721
01:12:54,450 --> 01:12:56,820
what does responsibility mean?
If there's no consequences?

1722
01:12:57,510 --> 01:12:59,730
Well,
that's a good question.

1723
01:13:00,180 --> 01:13:01,860
Well,
the consequences are public shaming.

1724
01:13:02,250 --> 01:13:07,250
Maybe he is the best person for the job,
despite the fact that he lied a decade 

1725
01:13:07,250 --> 01:13:10,820
ago,
but I still didn't know what 

1726
01:13:10,820 --> 01:13:10,820
responsibility means in this context.
I have taken responsibility.

1727
01:13:10,820 --> 01:13:12,820
I remember Janet,
I was a friend,

1728
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:13,860
a mine.
Janet Reno.

1729
01:13:13,861 --> 01:13:18,861
When Waco happened in all those kids 
died and all the sheep say Janet Reno 

1730
01:13:18,861 --> 01:13:22,551
was a friend of yours.
A friend of mine was talking about 

1731
01:13:22,551 --> 01:13:22,551
generally.
No,

1732
01:13:22,551 --> 01:13:22,551
no.
I knew Janet Reno Pals with Janet.

1733
01:13:22,551 --> 01:13:27,471
Reno was a friend of mine and she went 
on TV after Waco and all those people 

1734
01:13:29,461 --> 01:13:31,380
died and she goes,
this is my fault.

1735
01:13:31,381 --> 01:13:32,880
I take full responsibility.
My friends.

1736
01:13:32,881 --> 01:13:37,881
Like,
then you should be in jail if you are 

1737
01:13:37,881 --> 01:13:38,400
responsible for murdering dozens of 
people getting killed,

1738
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:42,180
you should be in jail.
Know sasquatch.

1739
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:45,180
Yeah.
How's that work?

1740
01:13:46,490 --> 01:13:49,710
Yeah,
just sturdy business.

1741
01:13:49,740 --> 01:13:52,710
It is a dirty business.
Is North Korea mad at us again?

1742
01:13:52,770 --> 01:13:57,770
I'm glad you're here today.
There was something this morning that I 

1743
01:13:57,770 --> 01:14:00,670
was reading what happened this morning.
North Korea is angry at us again,

1744
01:14:00,690 --> 01:14:04,260
so they just cycles of North Korea,
so they'll do good cop,

1745
01:14:04,261 --> 01:14:06,330
bad cop.
And we saw this happen.

1746
01:14:06,540 --> 01:14:08,730
It was just really amazing.
So North Korea has this,

1747
01:14:08,860 --> 01:14:12,130
uh,
a weapon that causes everyone

1748
01:14:12,130 --> 01:14:14,650
on earth to have amnesia about the 
career,

1749
01:14:14,860 --> 01:14:17,380
really angry.
So it was tensions as us,

1750
01:14:17,381 --> 01:14:22,381
tensions rise.
So they have this weapon that caused 

1751
01:14:22,381 --> 01:14:22,381
everyone to have amnesia,
right?

1752
01:14:22,381 --> 01:14:23,470
So they'll do something and then people 
forget what happened six months ago when

1753
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:26,110
the Singapore summit was happening,
um,

1754
01:14:26,170 --> 01:14:28,180
and they were making nice and everyone's
just like,

1755
01:14:28,181 --> 01:14:28,930
oh blah blah.
I go,

1756
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:32,620
last year they had sentenced president 
trump to death.

1757
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:38,280
They were threatening to new Guam and 
everyone just completely forgot about 

1758
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:38,280
that.
And then like,

1759
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:38,620
okay,
we're going to be nice.

1760
01:14:38,621 --> 01:14:40,450
It's like.
And then he cancels the summit,

1761
01:14:40,690 --> 01:14:43,630
the summit comes back on there,
they do this,

1762
01:14:43,690 --> 01:14:48,690
they've done this for years.
And it's like if you follow North Korea 

1763
01:14:48,690 --> 01:14:48,690
as I do,
it's my gig.

1764
01:14:48,690 --> 01:14:49,870
You see it coming.
But then everyone's like,

1765
01:14:49,930 --> 01:14:51,040
oh my God,
they're mad at us.

1766
01:14:51,041 --> 01:14:53,710
This has never happened before.
Like this has happened for 70 years.

1767
01:14:53,711 --> 01:14:55,390
Motherfuckers.
This is their shtick.

1768
01:14:56,530 --> 01:14:58,270
So what do you think the purpose of it 
is?

1769
01:14:58,271 --> 01:15:02,350
Just to stay relevant in the news and to
alert people that there's still conflict

1770
01:15:02,351 --> 01:15:02,750
between the two.

1771
01:15:03,850 --> 01:15:08,850
It's very important for them when they 
make any sort of concessions to say that

1772
01:15:09,171 --> 01:15:10,760
they were putting up a fight.
We're not,

1773
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:13,580
we're doing this because we want to,
not because you're making us doing it,

1774
01:15:13,620 --> 01:15:15,200
you know,
standing up for themselves.

1775
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:20,320
We're not going to get pushed around 
because they can't show submission or 

1776
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:23,801
weakness in any sense.
So president trump's been playing this 

1777
01:15:23,801 --> 01:15:26,981
very intelligently and the rest then in 
the corporate press won't tell you this 

1778
01:15:26,981 --> 01:15:30,521
because it's everything's about trump.
I don't fucking care about trump and 

1779
01:15:30,521 --> 01:15:30,521
this context.
I care what the North Korean people,

1780
01:15:30,521 --> 01:15:31,880
right?
The point is they are a,

1781
01:15:32,420 --> 01:15:37,420
they'll raise their radar rattler saber,
and then they'll be nice the next day 

1782
01:15:37,420 --> 01:15:38,360
and then they rattled a saber there 
nights.

1783
01:15:38,361 --> 01:15:39,440
Next Day it's,
it's,

1784
01:15:39,470 --> 01:15:41,960
it's as night follows day with them.
Well,

1785
01:15:42,020 --> 01:15:42,760
the culture is

1786
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:46,150
a really fascinating culture.
The culture of Korea in general.

1787
01:15:47,230 --> 01:15:52,230
There's,
there's so much to it that we have a 

1788
01:15:52,230 --> 01:15:53,830
really difficult time understanding.
Oh yes.

1789
01:15:53,831 --> 01:15:57,820
In terms of just the formalities in 
which you're allowed to communicate with

1790
01:15:57,821 --> 01:16:02,380
people the in the way that they must 
save face.

1791
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:04,420
Right.
And what they're doing.

1792
01:16:04,510 --> 01:16:07,550
Anytime there's any sort of negotiation 
there,

1793
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:11,890
there has to be some sort of an 
acknowledgement of their social status,

1794
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:13,150
their position.

1795
01:16:13,430 --> 01:16:13,970
Yeah.
Yeah.

1796
01:16:14,330 --> 01:16:16,700
They're very.
And South Korea too,

1797
01:16:16,701 --> 01:16:19,380
so people think South Korea is like 
America Junior.

1798
01:16:19,470 --> 01:16:22,110
It's not.
There are very different country from us

1799
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:25,320
and just because they're our ally 
doesn't mean they're all good guys too.

1800
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:28,820
I was just reading Malcolm Gladwell's 
outliers.

1801
01:16:29,390 --> 01:16:32,570
One of the things about it is how South 
Korea dealt with.

1802
01:16:32,660 --> 01:16:36,800
They went through a crisis of plane 
crashes and one of the problems with the

1803
01:16:36,801 --> 01:16:41,801
plane crashes was the way the 
subordinates were not allowed to 

1804
01:16:41,801 --> 01:16:42,290
question the pilots and the pilots 
retired,

1805
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:43,550
you know,
the way they fixed it,

1806
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,620
they made them all speak English.

1807
01:16:46,490 --> 01:16:51,490
How would that fix it?
Because English is a different language 

1808
01:16:51,490 --> 01:16:51,940
of the structure of the syntax 
structure.

1809
01:16:51,941 --> 01:16:52,030
Sure.

1810
01:16:52,030 --> 01:16:57,030
Of politeness and deferment in in the 
all the different things,

1811
01:16:57,041 --> 01:17:02,041
different sentences,
the way you're not allowed to 

1812
01:17:02,041 --> 01:17:02,540
communicate with people in Korean where 
there's a,

1813
01:17:02,620 --> 01:17:07,620
a,
a very strong tradition of like the 

1814
01:17:07,620 --> 01:17:11,820
Malcolm Gladwell goes into in great 
detail like superiors when they're 

1815
01:17:11,820 --> 01:17:15,701
around their subordinates,
the subordinates are not allowed to 

1816
01:17:15,701 --> 01:17:15,701
drink in front of them.
They can't smoke in front of them.

1817
01:17:15,701 --> 01:17:17,900
They have to turn away if they have a 
drink in front of them,

1818
01:17:18,140 --> 01:17:21,860
like the way they talk to them,
they bow to them,

1819
01:17:22,110 --> 01:17:25,910
they call them sir and I went through 
all this in taekwondo.

1820
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:31,240
Taekwondo is very structured that way 
and when I was teaching and when I was 

1821
01:17:31,240 --> 01:17:35,801
a.
When I was working for my Korean 

1822
01:17:35,801 --> 01:17:36,500
instructors,
like it was always sir,

1823
01:17:36,650 --> 01:17:39,920
it was always Mr Kim.
It was always very formal.

1824
01:17:39,950 --> 01:17:42,260
There was always bowing and it was,
there was,

1825
01:17:42,550 --> 01:17:47,550
you know,
and this is an Americanized version in 

1826
01:17:47,550 --> 01:17:48,500
English with their language,
with the Korean language.

1827
01:17:48,501 --> 01:17:53,501
They were talking about all the 
different proper forms of communication 

1828
01:17:53,501 --> 01:17:57,320
and the structure that's in place to 
establish who the dominant person is and

1829
01:17:57,321 --> 01:17:58,370
who the subordinate person

1830
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:03,760
and in North Korea there's a tense that 
they use only with regards to the 

1831
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:07,101
leaders.
So they've changed the language to that 

1832
01:18:07,101 --> 01:18:07,101
extent.
Even for them.

1833
01:18:07,101 --> 01:18:09,990
Yeah.
So what they did was they made the South

1834
01:18:09,990 --> 01:18:11,580
Korean pilots,
like all of them,

1835
01:18:11,820 --> 01:18:14,070
English was the primary language of 
communication.

1836
01:18:14,071 --> 01:18:16,410
They had to learn English now and they 
had to learn on their own dime.

1837
01:18:16,620 --> 01:18:21,620
Oh there.
They'll learn English and then I think 

1838
01:18:21,620 --> 01:18:23,400
they went with first names so we would 
work together.

1839
01:18:23,401 --> 01:18:25,330
I wouldn't say Mr.
Malice like,

1840
01:18:25,331 --> 01:18:27,120
because then I would have.
I would be different.

1841
01:18:27,190 --> 01:18:27,560
Yeah,
yeah,

1842
01:18:27,640 --> 01:18:28,680
yeah.
I would say Mike,

1843
01:18:28,980 --> 01:18:30,950
we got some frost on the wing of this 
plane.

1844
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:34,230
We should probably defrost this fucker 
and you and I would be.

1845
01:18:34,290 --> 01:18:37,380
Even though you would be the captain,
I would be your copilot.

1846
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:41,700
We would still be able to talk to each 
other as if we're friends and equals not

1847
01:18:41,701 --> 01:18:44,230
on this traditional Korean social story 
structure

1848
01:18:44,410 --> 01:18:49,410
at this happened in America too.
Like people freak out that trump is 

1849
01:18:49,410 --> 01:18:49,410
vulgar,
rising the presidency,

1850
01:18:49,410 --> 01:18:52,060
but it was a big deal of JFK and wear a 
hat at his inauguration.

1851
01:18:52,330 --> 01:18:55,060
And even before that ambulance you 
didn't have the hat.

1852
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:58,240
It's like vulgar hats.
Imagine if it was important.

1853
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:01,330
Imagine if trump wore a hat today.
I knew that hair.

1854
01:19:01,331 --> 01:19:02,420
I mean,
he's kind of wearing a hat.

1855
01:19:02,460 --> 01:19:07,460
Well,
he wears the make America great again 

1856
01:19:07,460 --> 01:19:07,460
hat.
But I mean like a boulder hat,

1857
01:19:07,460 --> 01:19:07,460
like one of them.
Yeah,

1858
01:19:07,460 --> 01:19:07,460
yeah,
yeah,

1859
01:19:07,460 --> 01:19:07,950
yeah.
Are there or the.

1860
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:10,010
Yeah,
the wicker ones and,

1861
01:19:10,011 --> 01:19:15,011
and FDR gotten shit because he referred 
to all his subordinates by their first 

1862
01:19:15,011 --> 01:19:18,310
name and this was a huge deal back then.
Instead it's interest to Roosevelt.

1863
01:19:18,311 --> 01:19:19,580
They were.
Howard would be.

1864
01:19:19,581 --> 01:19:23,540
So he tried to be informal and correct 
that he was being informed was like,

1865
01:19:24,050 --> 01:19:25,840
so this has been going on for a long 
time.

1866
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:30,840
The lack of formality.
Look how people used to dress in 

1867
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:32,671
airplanes.
They'd be been suits now there I had a 

1868
01:19:32,671 --> 01:19:34,690
situation in a plane here.
These people are just like animals,

1869
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:40,500
like dogs.
Dogs dress better than some of these 

1870
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:40,500
people.
Well,

1871
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:43,441
they bring their dogs to bring in dogs 
on planes and the subway in New York.

1872
01:19:43,661 --> 01:19:45,520
They started bringing them.
They always find your way.

1873
01:19:45,580 --> 01:19:50,580
All you have to do is have a piece of 
paper from a doctor that says you need 

1874
01:19:50,580 --> 01:19:53,611
help.
I don't think they needed a dog like on 

1875
01:19:53,611 --> 01:19:53,611
the subway.
They just take them like,

1876
01:19:53,611 --> 01:19:53,611
what are you going to fucking do about 
it?

1877
01:19:53,611 --> 01:19:53,611
Yet the bloods,
he goes,

1878
01:19:53,620 --> 01:19:58,620
let it go to shit.
That's a real problem with people that 

1879
01:19:58,620 --> 01:19:59,920
are scared of dogs.
Allergic dogs.

1880
01:19:59,950 --> 01:20:04,950
What about you have two dogs.
They're going to get into a fight or 

1881
01:20:04,950 --> 01:20:04,950
they start shitting somewhere.

1882
01:20:04,950 --> 01:20:05,440
We know we're not.
We don't want to San Francisco.

1883
01:20:05,441 --> 01:20:07,210
We don't have shit on the streets.
That's true.

1884
01:20:07,230 --> 01:20:08,340
Yeah.
Wow.

1885
01:20:08,730 --> 01:20:11,280
What happened?
What do you mean with Blasio?

1886
01:20:11,281 --> 01:20:12,600
Like what's he doing?
He's just basically like,

1887
01:20:12,601 --> 01:20:13,320
dude,
what the fuck you want?

1888
01:20:13,321 --> 01:20:16,050
I'm not going to enforce Giuliani's like
quality of life rules.

1889
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:19,170
So the new thing that the credence of 
started doing,

1890
01:20:19,910 --> 01:20:22,920
this happens at the gym and this happens
I seen on subway they just start playing

1891
01:20:22,921 --> 01:20:25,710
their music.
What do you mean people have their head,

1892
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:26,880
they're little,
uh,

1893
01:20:26,881 --> 01:20:28,470
iphone.
They just start playing music.

1894
01:20:28,471 --> 01:20:31,140
No headphones and I'm just like,
wow,

1895
01:20:31,170 --> 01:20:36,170
you need police brutality because 
obviously if you're this removed from 

1896
01:20:36,661 --> 01:20:39,720
what's appropriate behavior talk is not 
going to do for you.

1897
01:20:40,530 --> 01:20:45,530
Well,
if the gym doesn't the gym have its own 

1898
01:20:45,530 --> 01:20:45,530
music.
Yeah,

1899
01:20:45,530 --> 01:20:45,790
it does.
People play their music over the gym and

1900
01:20:45,791 --> 01:20:48,180
the locker room and some fucking dudes 
just playing his music.

1901
01:20:48,220 --> 01:20:49,530
I'm like,
what the fuck are you doing?

1902
01:20:50,150 --> 01:20:52,000
Oh,
and the pattern,

1903
01:20:52,020 --> 01:20:53,810
the weight,
yet I don't my point.

1904
01:20:53,830 --> 01:20:55,170
I'm the small dude,
you know,

1905
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:58,050
I can't go over to these beasts at the 
gym and be like,

1906
01:20:58,051 --> 01:21:00,240
excuse me sir,
your music's disturbing.

1907
01:21:00,241 --> 01:21:02,100
Like workout.
What kind of music you're dealing with?

1908
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:03,510
Is it rap?
I,

1909
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:05,780
I almost always know.
And that's like,

1910
01:21:05,820 --> 01:21:07,950
it's like the gym,
you're going to have like heavy metal or

1911
01:21:07,951 --> 01:21:09,830
rap or heavy metal,
right?

1912
01:21:10,150 --> 01:21:12,000
Dark,
dark,

1913
01:21:12,380 --> 01:21:12,720
dark,
dark,

1914
01:21:12,721 --> 01:21:13,040
dark,
dark,

1915
01:21:13,041 --> 01:21:13,420
dark,
dark,

1916
01:21:13,460 --> 01:21:14,060
dark,
dark,

1917
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:15,210
dark,
that kind of shit.

1918
01:21:15,850 --> 01:21:20,850
Trying to put your underwear on and 
you're thinking of peaceful thoughts 

1919
01:21:20,850 --> 01:21:23,421
after a nice workout or I'm trying to 
drop some sick burns on twitter and I'm 

1920
01:21:23,421 --> 01:21:23,421
like,
guys,

1921
01:21:23,710 --> 01:21:27,030
I've got some good verbiage.
Chair dropping sick burns guys.

1922
01:21:27,660 --> 01:21:32,660
Excuse me sir.
Could you please cut down that mumble 

1923
01:21:32,660 --> 01:21:32,660
rap?
I'm dropping.

1924
01:21:32,660 --> 01:21:33,240
Excuse me over here.

1925
01:21:33,290 --> 01:21:34,030
He's me,
sir.

1926
01:21:34,740 --> 01:21:37,680
I'm dunking on Tucker Carlson.
You're dunking on him.

1927
01:21:38,250 --> 01:21:39,840
The poor guy.
He gets a free pass.

1928
01:21:39,870 --> 01:21:42,260
What's matter of Jimmy?
I'd never heard that.

1929
01:21:42,261 --> 01:21:43,350
Kennedy and things,
so I looked it up.

1930
01:21:43,351 --> 01:21:44,700
He actually,
according to snopes,

1931
01:21:44,701 --> 01:21:47,610
revived an inaugural hat wearing 
tradition.

1932
01:21:47,850 --> 01:21:50,340
He did wait.
Kennedy did not wear that.

1933
01:21:50,370 --> 01:21:53,700
He walked all the way without his hat.
That's not what this says.

1934
01:21:53,730 --> 01:21:56,610
This is from 2007 on snopes.
He was wearing it most of the day.

1935
01:21:56,611 --> 01:21:58,740
This is like a long like,
oh yeah,

1936
01:21:58,741 --> 01:21:59,520
look,
he's wearing it.

1937
01:21:59,521 --> 01:22:00,870
It's like a rumor that he killed the 
hat.

1938
01:22:00,871 --> 01:22:02,400
Industry will scroll.
Scroll down.

1939
01:22:02,401 --> 01:22:03,660
You can see him wearing it.
Yeah,

1940
01:22:03,661 --> 01:22:06,030
he's wearing a most of the day there.
As he gave his speech,

1941
01:22:06,031 --> 01:22:09,720
he took it off,
put it back on for the rest of the day.

1942
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:11,730
Interested in is like a long room and 
it's been going on.

1943
01:22:12,230 --> 01:22:14,260
That's interesting.
We'll get that fella.

1944
01:22:14,440 --> 01:22:15,780
Should've had it lined with lead,
Huh?

1945
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:18,150
Well,
I don't think that would have helped.

1946
01:22:18,310 --> 01:22:20,430
It wouldn't hurt.
It wouldn't help the shot to the neck.

1947
01:22:20,431 --> 01:22:21,900
He took a look at that.
Uh,

1948
01:22:21,901 --> 01:22:24,060
that hat with him with the hat.
Look at that.

1949
01:22:24,420 --> 01:22:29,420
Look at that.
It's also weird seeing him like a 

1950
01:22:29,420 --> 01:22:29,420
talking truman.
Like there's some such different areas.

1951
01:22:29,420 --> 01:22:30,060
I know,
right.

1952
01:22:30,061 --> 01:22:31,710
You would think that they weren't alive 
together.

1953
01:22:32,550 --> 01:22:33,240
Well,
Herbert Hoover,

1954
01:22:33,241 --> 01:22:36,270
he visited at the White House.
Herbert Hoover visited JFK.

1955
01:22:36,390 --> 01:22:38,240
Wow.
I look at,

1956
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:40,080
look at Lyndon Johnson thinking three 
more years,

1957
01:22:40,081 --> 01:22:41,400
man.
And I'm going to be president.

1958
01:22:41,401 --> 01:22:46,401
I'm going to get you shot and it gets.
You fucker look at him looking over at 

1959
01:22:46,401 --> 01:22:50,181
him and your brother too.
Maybe I'll fuck your wife when you're 

1960
01:22:50,181 --> 01:22:53,490
dead.
Lyndon Johnson used to take shifts with 

1961
01:22:53,490 --> 01:22:53,760
the press right in front of them.
Yeah.

1962
01:22:54,490 --> 01:22:56,580
Let them in the bathroom was dropping 
logs.

1963
01:22:56,610 --> 01:23:01,610
Yeah.
And he would like whip out his dick all 

1964
01:23:01,610 --> 01:23:01,610
the time.
He was like,

1965
01:23:01,610 --> 01:23:04,161
the hell horrible person.
Horrible for us because he whipped his 

1966
01:23:04,161 --> 01:23:04,630
dick out.
Doesn't make them a horrible person.

1967
01:23:04,631 --> 01:23:06,220
No,
that'd be really happy with his Dick.

1968
01:23:06,300 --> 01:23:06,880
Well,
that's true.

1969
01:23:06,910 --> 01:23:08,560
That's not.
Does not make him a horrible person.

1970
01:23:09,230 --> 01:23:14,230
The horrible person is the guys whipping
out his dick and playing his music at 

1971
01:23:14,230 --> 01:23:14,230
black room.
That's the horrible.

1972
01:23:14,230 --> 01:23:18,600
That's a horrible person.
If he's playing that led music and he's 

1973
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:20,470
stroking his cock at the same time,
that's a horrible precedent.

1974
01:23:20,471 --> 01:23:23,050
I guess there's a locker room and you're
just trying to drop sick burns.

1975
01:23:23,080 --> 01:23:24,010
I'm trying to.
Yeah,

1976
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:25,600
jail.
It's all I want to do.

1977
01:23:25,601 --> 01:23:28,440
I just did my dead lifts pathetically.
Are you gonna?

1978
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:33,480
Leave.
See Tucker Carlson alone for a little 

1979
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:33,480
while.
I never took it on as I.

1980
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:34,270
I've been on Tucker's show a few times.

1981
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:37,960
I've never gotten tucker face,
so I'm very,

1982
01:23:37,961 --> 01:23:39,760
very happy face.
Oh,

1983
01:23:39,761 --> 01:23:40,940
when he gives you that look.
Yeah.

1984
01:23:41,050 --> 01:23:42,610
I've never gotten.
Who's going after you?

1985
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:47,880
He's never done that.
So he's been very respectful because 

1986
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:47,880
very few people know North Korea.
That's what I'm there to talk about,

1987
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:52,670
so they're not.
I'm not being coming at that from a 

1988
01:23:52,670 --> 01:23:52,670
partisan perspective at all.
Right.

1989
01:23:52,670 --> 01:23:52,670
You're coming to educate.
Right.

1990
01:23:52,670 --> 01:23:54,520
So I've never gotten heat about that at 
all.

1991
01:23:54,580 --> 01:23:57,430
I wonder what's going to happen with 
them and all this stuff because now that

1992
01:23:57,431 --> 01:23:59,660
his house is a bit like people know 
where his house is,

1993
01:23:59,740 --> 01:24:01,870
when you probably going to move,
as you know,

1994
01:24:01,871 --> 01:24:04,660
when you don't have to.
Someone's family that sets off some part

1995
01:24:04,661 --> 01:24:09,661
of your brain that's something fierce 
and he's not gonna just take this lying 

1996
01:24:09,661 --> 01:24:10,930
down.
Yeah,

1997
01:24:11,020 --> 01:24:14,440
I mean I wonder if there's legal action 
it's going to be had.

1998
01:24:16,540 --> 01:24:18,520
I don't know.
It's all fucked up man.

1999
01:24:18,750 --> 01:24:23,750
It's just we've it,
we've never had a time where in my life 

2000
01:24:23,750 --> 01:24:26,050
where I can remember the left and the 
right being so combative,

2001
01:24:26,110 --> 01:24:29,890
not just disagreeing about things,
not just a debating things,

2002
01:24:29,891 --> 01:24:31,840
but this kind of shit.
Like riots,

2003
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:37,200
like you know,
this is of the right was on their knees 

2004
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:37,780
all this time for a long time and now 
they're like,

2005
01:24:37,781 --> 01:24:39,460
you know what,
you people are fucking terrible.

2006
01:24:39,461 --> 01:24:42,100
Fuck you.
Is that the case,

2007
01:24:42,101 --> 01:24:42,910
man?
There's never.

2008
01:24:43,650 --> 01:24:48,650
Is it the right was underneath.
There was never a left wing anti foot 

2009
01:24:48,650 --> 01:24:50,170
type organization because the right was 
being subordinate to them in many ways,

2010
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:52,630
like the press had a complete monopoly 
on speech.

2011
01:24:53,080 --> 01:24:54,580
Twenty 12,
2012.

2012
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:56,890
Mitt Romney's having this debate with 
Obama,

2013
01:24:56,891 --> 01:24:58,480
Candy Crowley.
He's the moderator,

2014
01:24:58,481 --> 01:24:59,470
right?
The moderator,

2015
01:24:59,710 --> 01:25:02,410
and she starts arguing with Mitt Romney 
during the debate.

2016
01:25:02,620 --> 01:25:04,650
You're the fucking moderator.
Sit down and shut up late.

2017
01:25:04,660 --> 01:25:05,810
You're arguing about.
She's like,

2018
01:25:05,811 --> 01:25:07,300
Oh,
you got this tax wrong,

2019
01:25:07,301 --> 01:25:07,570
blah,
blah,

2020
01:25:07,571 --> 01:25:07,840
blah,
blah,

2021
01:25:07,841 --> 01:25:08,220
blah.
And she,

2022
01:25:08,230 --> 01:25:09,400
even before the debate,
she says,

2023
01:25:09,401 --> 01:25:11,240
I'm going to correct them if necessary.
Bitch,

2024
01:25:11,241 --> 01:25:12,220
you're the moderator.
Sit down.

2025
01:25:12,260 --> 01:25:15,340
Shut the fuck up.
She's supposed to.

2026
01:25:15,341 --> 01:25:18,230
If she knows something's,
she's not supposed to say anything.

2027
01:25:18,790 --> 01:25:23,790
It's like a judge.
If the judge has two sides as someone's 

2028
01:25:23,790 --> 01:25:24,790
deloitte is lying,
it's the other lawyer has to make it up.

2029
01:25:24,820 --> 01:25:27,070
That's a good point.
But as a moderator,

2030
01:25:27,071 --> 01:25:31,450
aren't you also some kind of an immune.
You not necessarily an entertainer,

2031
01:25:31,451 --> 01:25:33,610
but you're,
you're moving the thing along.

2032
01:25:33,820 --> 01:25:37,450
If you know something to be incorrect.
Like if someone says,

2033
01:25:37,590 --> 01:25:38,410
uh,
you know,

2034
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:41,170
I am James Brown,
Shot Jfk,

2035
01:25:41,250 --> 01:25:46,250
I am sure that there was a contract that
the Romney team and the Obama team sat 

2036
01:25:46,250 --> 01:25:48,940
down and worked out between them.
Like how much time?

2037
01:25:48,941 --> 01:25:50,050
The forum,
the location.

2038
01:25:50,051 --> 01:25:53,170
I'm sure that said the moderate.
We're going to find an honest objective.

2039
01:25:53,171 --> 01:25:55,390
Moderate who is not gonna interfere.
There's no fucking way they wouldn't.

2040
01:25:55,660 --> 01:25:57,460
Mm.
Was she correct?

2041
01:25:57,550 --> 01:25:58,660
No,
I don't think she was.

2042
01:25:58,661 --> 01:26:01,210
He look it up.
I'm 99 percent sure she was wrong too.

2043
01:26:01,270 --> 01:26:02,740
That's hilarious.
And he,

2044
01:26:02,741 --> 01:26:03,500
but he,
it,

2045
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:05,210
he just ate it.
He just ate.

2046
01:26:05,211 --> 01:26:10,211
And then you have then in 2016 where 
they're just telling the fucking report 

2047
01:26:10,211 --> 01:26:10,211
is,
fuck you.

2048
01:26:10,211 --> 01:26:12,050
You're not the holly talk.
Ted Cruz lost to shit on them.

2049
01:26:12,260 --> 01:26:13,790
He's like,
what kind of questions are these,

2050
01:26:14,780 --> 01:26:16,010
you know,
and the audience.

2051
01:26:16,011 --> 01:26:16,510
Cheers.
Not.

2052
01:26:16,511 --> 01:26:19,910
That was a big turning point it.
So here it is.

2053
01:26:19,911 --> 01:26:20,020
Yeah.

2054
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:23,190
Did the attack.
He went in the Rose Garden and said that

2055
01:26:23,191 --> 01:26:28,191
this was an act of terror.
You said in the Rose Garden the day 

2056
01:26:28,271 --> 01:26:30,100
after the attack.
It was an act of terror.

2057
01:26:32,270 --> 01:26:34,820
It was not a spontaneous demonstration,
is that what you're saying?

2058
01:26:34,850 --> 01:26:35,820
Please proceed.
Gunner,

2059
01:26:37,260 --> 01:26:42,260
I want to make sure we get that for the 
record because it took the president 14 

2060
01:26:42,260 --> 01:26:43,550
days before he called the attack in 
Benghazi,

2061
01:26:43,820 --> 01:26:44,540
an act of terror.

2062
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:46,360
Get the transfer.
He didn't.

2063
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:47,200
In fact,
sir.

2064
01:26:47,201 --> 01:26:52,201
So let me,
let me call it an activity that he did 

2065
01:26:52,900 --> 01:26:55,720
call her an act of terror.
It did as well.

2066
01:26:56,020 --> 01:26:57,670
Take it.
Did as well.

2067
01:26:57,680 --> 01:27:00,310
Uh,
take a two weeks or so.

2068
01:27:00,470 --> 01:27:02,560
Uh,
for the whole idea of there being a riot

2069
01:27:02,561 --> 01:27:04,940
out there about this tape to come out.
You're okay.

2070
01:27:05,010 --> 01:27:06,710
Right?
The administration,

2071
01:27:06,890 --> 01:27:10,150
the administration indicated that this 
was a,

2072
01:27:10,410 --> 01:27:15,410
a reaction.
Do I do a video and was a spontaneous 

2073
01:27:15,410 --> 01:27:16,310
reaction.
It took them a long time to say this was

2074
01:27:16,311 --> 01:27:18,810
a terrorist act by a terrorist group 
and,

2075
01:27:18,870 --> 01:27:22,370
and to suggest it or am I incorrect in 
that regard?

2076
01:27:22,530 --> 01:27:23,570
On,
on Sunday,

2077
01:27:23,780 --> 01:27:24,520
the,
uh,

2078
01:27:24,550 --> 01:27:25,700
your,
your secretary,

2079
01:27:25,701 --> 01:27:28,880
or excuse me,
the ambassador to the United Nations one

2080
01:27:28,881 --> 01:27:33,881
of the Sunday to television shows and,
and spoke about how this was a 

2081
01:27:33,881 --> 01:27:37,091
spontaneous.
I'm happy to have a longer conversation 

2082
01:27:37,091 --> 01:27:37,091
about for policy,

2083
01:27:37,091 --> 01:27:37,840
but I want.
I want to move you one and all.

2084
01:27:40,130 --> 01:27:41,910
Hm.
What'd she seemed like?

2085
01:27:41,911 --> 01:27:46,911
She was just agreeing and seemed like 
she was still on her role.

2086
01:27:47,640 --> 01:27:49,020
Right.
It's still a hurdle.

2087
01:27:49,021 --> 01:27:51,420
Say you're wrong about this.
You write about this in my opinion.

2088
01:27:51,421 --> 01:27:52,020
But anyway,
that's.

2089
01:27:52,140 --> 01:27:53,860
I don't think she said you're wrong 
though.

2090
01:27:53,861 --> 01:27:56,340
Did she?
She said that is correct.

2091
01:27:56,640 --> 01:27:59,820
It took two weeks.
I mean she's basically with Ron.

2092
01:27:59,821 --> 01:28:04,821
Was there another example of this?
Because I remember that I remember it 

2093
01:28:04,821 --> 01:28:05,430
got heated between the two of them so I 
could be talking to my ass,

2094
01:28:05,640 --> 01:28:07,410
but I could see.
Use your.

2095
01:28:07,430 --> 01:28:12,430
You being correct that even what she did
there in saying that he's correct is 

2096
01:28:12,430 --> 01:28:13,420
really out of line,
right?

2097
01:28:13,680 --> 01:28:15,090
Yeah.
She seemed a little flustered.

2098
01:28:15,091 --> 01:28:17,760
They're like not exactly sure what to do
and what not to do,

2099
01:28:18,210 --> 01:28:20,840
but there have been many example people 
forgot about that.

2100
01:28:20,850 --> 01:28:21,960
Ben Gazi thing was

2101
01:28:23,860 --> 01:28:26,140
the same one.
I don't know if this was the same one.

2102
01:28:26,170 --> 01:28:28,860
There's no volume.
I don't know why just died.

2103
01:28:29,230 --> 01:28:30,640
Okay.
Either way.

2104
01:28:30,700 --> 01:28:35,700
Yeah.
It seems like she's doing the same 

2105
01:28:35,700 --> 01:28:35,700
thing,
but that Ben Gazi thing that was.

2106
01:28:35,700 --> 01:28:39,930
That was so bizarre.
People forgot about how that they were 

2107
01:28:39,930 --> 01:28:42,440
trying to blame it on that video.
Your movie or video?

2108
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:44,200
What was it called?
Something I don't remember,

2109
01:28:44,201 --> 01:28:49,201
and Hillary,
I think at the time when she was 

2110
01:28:49,201 --> 01:28:49,201
secretary of state,
she refused to go on and they made Susan

2111
01:28:49,201 --> 01:28:51,830
rice walk the plank for that one.
Oh,

2112
01:28:52,900 --> 01:28:54,130
that was a weird one,
man.

2113
01:28:54,160 --> 01:28:56,140
That movie was weird.
It was so bad.

2114
01:28:56,141 --> 01:28:59,060
It was almost like a.
Did they blame it on loose change?

2115
01:28:59,061 --> 01:28:59,900
Is that the one that they play?
No,

2116
01:28:59,910 --> 01:29:00,270
no,
no,

2117
01:29:00,271 --> 01:29:00,630
no,
no,

2118
01:29:00,730 --> 01:29:01,920
no,
no.

2119
01:29:01,921 --> 01:29:01,980
It

2120
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:06,980
was a movie.
It was like a terrible movie that 

2121
01:29:06,980 --> 01:29:10,200
someone had made like the tiers of the 
Muslims or something like that.

2122
01:29:10,470 --> 01:29:12,480
I forget the name of it,
but it was so bad.

2123
01:29:12,510 --> 01:29:16,880
It almost seemed like a parody film or 
some people had said like,

2124
01:29:16,890 --> 01:29:20,550
this is like,
this is some CIA production.

2125
01:29:21,400 --> 01:29:26,400
It's interesting how memory works.
I remembered it being much more 

2126
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:29,551
combative than it was when we just 
watched it and I would have sworn on a 

2127
01:29:29,551 --> 01:29:31,420
bible that it was very,
very heated and then looking at that,

2128
01:29:31,421 --> 01:29:32,060
it wasn't that bad.

2129
01:29:32,130 --> 01:29:37,130
Well,
this brings us back to what we're 

2130
01:29:37,130 --> 01:29:38,280
talking about with cabinet and thinking 
about things that happen when you're 17.

2131
01:29:38,350 --> 01:29:39,420
Right?
And tribalism.

2132
01:29:39,650 --> 01:29:40,320
Yeah.
Yeah.

2133
01:29:40,410 --> 01:29:45,060
I mean the memory that we have sucks.
It's just shitty.

2134
01:29:45,061 --> 01:29:50,061
It's just being a human being.
I mean I have some absolute memories 

2135
01:29:50,061 --> 01:29:54,081
about facts that I know to be true in 
terms of like statistics and things that

2136
01:29:54,271 --> 01:29:58,180
took place and that I've stored in my 
memory because of my job because like,

2137
01:29:58,410 --> 01:30:03,410
especially when it comes to fights,
like I have a pretty good database of 

2138
01:30:03,571 --> 01:30:05,040
fight.
We'd even then occasionally I'm like,

2139
01:30:05,220 --> 01:30:10,220
is that how it went?
Why don't I think it was the second 

2140
01:30:10,220 --> 01:30:10,220
round,
Huh?

2141
01:30:10,220 --> 01:30:11,430
Yeah.
Memory suck.

2142
01:30:11,930 --> 01:30:12,540
Yeah,
it does.

2143
01:30:12,750 --> 01:30:17,750
Yeah.
Especially when you're drinking booze 

2144
01:30:17,750 --> 01:30:17,750
will be telling me about all that booze 
you drink.

2145
01:30:17,750 --> 01:30:17,750
Oh God,
what are you doing?

2146
01:30:17,750 --> 01:30:18,040
This is such a good.
Oh,

2147
01:30:18,050 --> 01:30:19,340
the arduous march.
Yeah.

2148
01:30:19,350 --> 01:30:20,490
Okay.
This is really exciting.

2149
01:30:20,491 --> 01:30:25,170
So I went on this rabbit hole,
I'm not a big drinker,

2150
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:27,120
right?
And I did this.

2151
01:30:27,121 --> 01:30:32,121
I have a lot.
I did a live stream and I tried eight 

2152
01:30:32,121 --> 01:30:34,341
different kinds of Heinz Ketchup because
I love Heinz Ketchup and I thought this 

2153
01:30:34,341 --> 01:30:34,341
is a different kinds.
I'm like,

2154
01:30:34,341 --> 01:30:34,341
yeah,
let's.

2155
01:30:34,341 --> 01:30:34,830
I'm like,
let's work out.

2156
01:30:35,070 --> 01:30:37,410
I'm going to try all eight and give my 
opinion in all eight.

2157
01:30:37,950 --> 01:30:42,950
And I said,
I went down a rabbit hole and I thought 

2158
01:30:42,950 --> 01:30:45,431
with all this weird liquor,
I'm not a big drinker if you guys want 

2159
01:30:45,431 --> 01:30:45,431
to pay for these bottles,
the stupid,

2160
01:30:45,431 --> 01:30:46,650
the live stream people,
the audience,

2161
01:30:47,010 --> 01:30:48,480
I'll buy them and I'll,
I'll do it.

2162
01:30:48,750 --> 01:30:53,280
And they just kept checking in.
I bought 32 bottles November 16th.

2163
01:30:53,550 --> 01:30:56,490
Me and six of my buddies are going to 
be.

2164
01:30:56,490 --> 01:31:01,490
And I'm like,
how do I return value guys are chipping 

2165
01:31:01,490 --> 01:31:01,490
in for these bottles.
They go do it with people.

2166
01:31:01,490 --> 01:31:05,160
So it's me and six of my friends were 
doing quarter shots and seeing if we get

2167
01:31:05,161 --> 01:31:07,820
through all 32 of these weird liquors,
uh,

2168
01:31:07,930 --> 01:31:10,030
and you can quit at any shots.
Well,

2169
01:31:10,080 --> 01:31:12,360
32 times a quarter to eight shots.
I know,

2170
01:31:12,361 --> 01:31:13,770
that's what I'm saying.
That's a lot.

2171
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:17,130
That's a lot of booze.
It's a lot of booze and some of them are

2172
01:31:17,131 --> 01:31:19,200
really exciting somewhere.
And not succeeding mouth.

2173
01:31:19,201 --> 01:31:24,201
It's going to be numb after like shot 
number five and also the different 

2174
01:31:24,201 --> 01:31:24,201
alcohol by proof.
They're different.

2175
01:31:24,201 --> 01:31:26,010
Every one's a different flavor.
They're all crazy.

2176
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:28,270
Um,
so I,

2177
01:31:28,271 --> 01:31:29,070
I,
it's just,

2178
01:31:29,071 --> 01:31:30,240
I'm very,
very excited with this.

2179
01:31:30,241 --> 01:31:32,430
We're going to be streaming it from 
compound and at my house.

2180
01:31:32,550 --> 01:31:35,460
Yeah.
I found there's this one company from.

2181
01:31:35,490 --> 01:31:37,800
This is for credit for people.
If people want to have credit,

2182
01:31:38,160 --> 01:31:43,160
there's this company from Denmark,
you probably haven't heard them called 

2183
01:31:43,160 --> 01:31:43,530
empirical spirits.
So this guy's really wanker.

2184
01:31:43,531 --> 01:31:48,531
This former chef,
and he figured out new ways to make 

2185
01:31:48,531 --> 01:31:51,561
liquor and he made one that's Habanero,
but the capsaicin doesn't get through 

2186
01:31:51,561 --> 01:31:53,820
the distilling process.
So I can't handle heat.

2187
01:31:53,821 --> 01:31:56,810
I'm a bitch.
You're drinking the tastes that Habanero

2188
01:31:56,811 --> 01:31:59,460
is without any of the heat.
Wow.

2189
01:31:59,560 --> 01:32:00,190
And then he made

2190
01:32:00,190 --> 01:32:03,120
one which tastes called Charlene Mcgee.
It's the character from firestarter,

2191
01:32:03,130 --> 01:32:05,440
Drew Barrymore's character.
It's like drinking smoke.

2192
01:32:05,500 --> 01:32:09,010
But it's smooth,
so it's really cool.

2193
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:14,040
What's the Habanero one calls A.
I hate the name because it's so 

2194
01:32:14,040 --> 01:32:17,341
pedestrian because it's so creative.
What he's done and it's called fuck 

2195
01:32:17,341 --> 01:32:19,360
trump and his stupid fucking will.
No.

2196
01:32:19,780 --> 01:32:20,620
Yeah,
no.

2197
01:32:20,650 --> 01:32:22,600
Yeah,
the wait a minute.

2198
01:32:23,350 --> 01:32:26,440
He's got five of them.
The whiskey is whiskey or bourbon,

2199
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:29,510
like I don't know what to call it 
because it's a new kind of a gala core.

2200
01:32:29,610 --> 01:32:34,610
I think it for tech.
I don't know what the term is because 

2201
01:32:34,610 --> 01:32:37,101
they're distilling it into crazy siphiwe
and it's called fuck trump and his 

2202
01:32:37,101 --> 01:32:37,101
stupid fucking wall.
Yeah.

2203
01:32:37,101 --> 01:32:38,560
That's literally the name of it.
Look.

2204
01:32:38,561 --> 01:32:40,690
Yeah.
That's hilarious.

2205
01:32:40,691 --> 01:32:42,220
It sounds delicious.
It is.

2206
01:32:42,250 --> 01:32:47,250
The idea of.
I'm really excited about the idea of 

2207
01:32:47,250 --> 01:32:47,250
Habanero without the heat.
Although I do like heat.

2208
01:32:47,250 --> 01:32:49,250
There isn't say unfortunately we can not
see.

2209
01:32:49,810 --> 01:32:54,810
This is so crazy that that is the actual
name of the booze and he's got one which

2210
01:32:55,871 --> 01:32:57,880
is of.
What's that monetary?

2211
01:32:57,940 --> 01:32:59,560
What does that.
KKR Denmark.

2212
01:32:59,750 --> 01:33:01,720
Chronic muggers.
Dinner Crowns.

2213
01:33:01,721 --> 01:33:06,721
Yeah.
He's got one which is called a soup 

2214
01:33:06,721 --> 01:33:06,721
blend,
which is Russell Minute,

2215
01:33:06,721 --> 01:33:09,460
which is spices mixed with a cocoa 
shells.

2216
01:33:09,550 --> 01:33:11,380
Jamie,
order us a bottle of this jazz.

2217
01:33:13,710 --> 01:33:15,730
You can get it for you.
What's it say?

2218
01:33:15,980 --> 01:33:18,580
You can't get it to the states.
So here's the thing,

2219
01:33:18,581 --> 01:33:19,370
Joe.
There's like two.

2220
01:33:19,420 --> 01:33:21,130
There's two stores in America that have 
it.

2221
01:33:21,190 --> 01:33:22,600
I have it.
I'll get you a bottle.

2222
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:26,410
Told ones in Brooklyn.
This one's in Manhattan.

2223
01:33:26,411 --> 01:33:29,110
I don't know where the other one is.
It's really fun.

2224
01:33:30,070 --> 01:33:32,350
That is.
He's making one now out of tuna.

2225
01:33:32,860 --> 01:33:37,860
Tuna fish.
Now think how smart you have to be to 

2226
01:33:37,860 --> 01:33:40,891
turn tune into a drinkable liquor.
I was on Anthony Show and one of his 

2227
01:33:41,531 --> 01:33:44,800
boys brought in some beer that's made 
with weed.

2228
01:33:45,080 --> 01:33:45,720
Oh yeah,
yeah,

2229
01:33:45,730 --> 01:33:46,710
yeah,
yeah.

2230
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:48,450
The scientist guy.
Yeah,

2231
01:33:48,451 --> 01:33:49,150
yeah,
yeah.

2232
01:33:49,160 --> 01:33:50,560
Drank.
Some of that was a horrible,

2233
01:33:50,561 --> 01:33:53,230
very good.
They all listened to his bat and it will

2234
01:33:53,231 --> 01:33:58,231
fuck you up.
It was 100 milligrams in the whole 

2235
01:33:58,231 --> 01:33:58,360
bottle and I drank about a third of the 
bottle and I was like,

2236
01:33:58,361 --> 01:33:59,110
yikes.

2237
01:33:59,110 --> 01:34:00,880
I feel that.
Here we go.

2238
01:34:02,700 --> 01:34:04,540
I was high for a couple of hours after 
that.

2239
01:34:04,541 --> 01:34:05,160
Shit.
That shit.

2240
01:34:05,210 --> 01:34:07,650
That's just no joke.
No joke.

2241
01:34:07,670 --> 01:34:09,280
Eddy edibles are no joke,
man.

2242
01:34:09,281 --> 01:34:14,281
And that was for me,
that was post sober October so that we 

2243
01:34:14,281 --> 01:34:17,020
drink was the first marijuana I had had 
a whole month.

2244
01:34:17,530 --> 01:34:19,210
So it kiss your ass.
It was pretty good.

2245
01:34:19,270 --> 01:34:20,650
I'm scared of this,
uh,

2246
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:22,210
argyris.
I'm not going to lie.

2247
01:34:22,630 --> 01:34:24,040
You shouldn't be scared.
All that stuff.

2248
01:34:24,041 --> 01:34:26,620
Fuck trump and the stupid fucking wall.
You should be scared of that.

2249
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:27,670
Well,
that's sweet.

2250
01:34:28,050 --> 01:34:28,840
Is it?
Yeah.

2251
01:34:28,990 --> 01:34:30,550
That one I tried.
That one I tried.

2252
01:34:30,630 --> 01:34:32,380
Was it,
can you compare it to something?

2253
01:34:32,730 --> 01:34:35,770
Um,
because he cuts it with Habanero vinegar

2254
01:34:35,771 --> 01:34:36,720
also,
isn't there?

2255
01:34:36,850 --> 01:34:39,450
So it's got a vinegar kick it.
See,

2256
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:41,410
the thing is when you're Willy Wonka,
nothing's like it.

2257
01:34:41,411 --> 01:34:42,160
Right?
So like,

2258
01:34:42,360 --> 01:34:44,930
it's hard for me to have the vocabulary 
to compare these two.

2259
01:34:44,940 --> 01:34:47,290
It's got the bell pepper kind of 
sweetness.

2260
01:34:47,380 --> 01:34:49,150
Wow.
It doesn't have a burn.

2261
01:34:49,151 --> 01:34:50,320
So it's,
it's smooth.

2262
01:34:50,710 --> 01:34:55,710
Um,
the fire that charlene is the one I 

2263
01:34:55,710 --> 01:34:55,710
really liked.
The fire one.

2264
01:34:55,710 --> 01:34:57,380
It's so crazy.
It feels like a dragon.

2265
01:34:57,470 --> 01:34:58,280
What's the alcohol

2266
01:34:58,280 --> 01:35:01,250
content in something like this is 
Charlene Makia thinks 40,

2267
01:35:01,580 --> 01:35:05,180
80 proof.
This one's I think 54 proof.

2268
01:35:05,690 --> 01:35:07,140
So it's pretty strong.
Yeah.

2269
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:09,450
Let's go kick.
It's got a kick goals.

2270
01:35:09,460 --> 01:35:12,650
Something going on there.
50 proof means 25 percent alcohol,

2271
01:35:12,651 --> 01:35:13,160
right?
Yeah.

2272
01:35:13,300 --> 01:35:14,960
Yeah.
Man.

2273
01:35:15,550 --> 01:35:18,380
These wizards today,
they're doing all kinds of things.

2274
01:35:18,940 --> 01:35:20,990
That's what drives me crazy when people 
are like,

2275
01:35:20,991 --> 01:35:23,390
there's nothing interesting out there.
There's your fan of this.

2276
01:35:23,391 --> 01:35:25,760
There's so many creative people in every
field.

2277
01:35:26,370 --> 01:35:28,580
Nothing interesting out there.
Basic people.

2278
01:35:28,670 --> 01:35:33,440
Non-Content monkey sees it.
There's a lot of basic bitches.

2279
01:35:34,240 --> 01:35:34,850
I'm like,
dude,

2280
01:35:34,851 --> 01:35:36,800
there's so much.
So what does an NPC.

2281
01:35:37,310 --> 01:35:39,590
You don't know this meme.
Is that a scientology thing?

2282
01:35:39,620 --> 01:35:40,700
No.
Non-Player character.

2283
01:35:40,970 --> 01:35:42,710
Non-Player can't.
You don't know about this.

2284
01:35:43,010 --> 01:35:48,010
Do I get to tell you the MPC means this 
is the most important to you for a 

2285
01:35:48,010 --> 01:35:48,010
lifetime?
Yeah.

2286
01:35:48,010 --> 01:35:48,010
Okay.
Here we go.

2287
01:35:48,010 --> 01:35:51,140
Breaking it down as quickly as possible.
I'm going to show my age.

2288
01:35:51,430 --> 01:35:52,700
When you.
When we were younger,

2289
01:35:52,701 --> 01:35:54,740
we played games like final fantasy and 
ultimate.

2290
01:35:54,741 --> 01:35:59,741
Right,
and in those games you go to like the 

2291
01:35:59,741 --> 01:36:02,290
armor store or the weapons store and 
you're by your sword or you buy your 

2292
01:36:02,290 --> 01:36:05,891
armor.
There's a guy running that store within 

2293
01:36:05,891 --> 01:36:05,891
the game.
Yes.

2294
01:36:05,891 --> 01:36:06,630
He does not exist outside of that store.
Right.

2295
01:36:06,680 --> 01:36:09,200
That character,
all he does is by armor and sell armor.

2296
01:36:09,201 --> 01:36:10,490
He doesn't have a life.
It doesn't a kid.

2297
01:36:10,491 --> 01:36:11,510
You go there at midnight,
he's there.

2298
01:36:11,511 --> 01:36:12,380
You go there at 8:00
AM,

2299
01:36:12,381 --> 01:36:17,381
he's there,
he's the player characters you're 

2300
01:36:17,381 --> 01:36:19,931
playing.
He's the non-player character and the 

2301
01:36:19,931 --> 01:36:22,691
point this mean makes is the vast 
majority of humans are non player 

2302
01:36:22,691 --> 01:36:26,051
characters.
They have no pr mind outside their 

2303
01:36:26,051 --> 01:36:28,451
programming,
so they call it msnbc or the at NPC is 

2304
01:36:28,451 --> 01:36:30,710
the network and you'll go look the press
corps,

2305
01:36:30,711 --> 01:36:32,470
there'll be like orange man,
bad in peach,

2306
01:36:32,490 --> 01:36:35,480
45 Russia,
and that's all they know how to say,

2307
01:36:35,481 --> 01:36:39,350
and you see this on twitter where it's 
one thing when people say cliched ideas,

2308
01:36:39,650 --> 01:36:42,200
but they'll say cliched ideas in a 
cliched way.

2309
01:36:42,460 --> 01:36:44,360
Yeah,
and it's like you have no mind.

2310
01:36:44,390 --> 01:36:47,390
You're just repeating what has been 
programmed to you and your script and as

2311
01:36:47,391 --> 01:36:52,391
soon as you mentioned certain terms,
is it just a kneejerk speech that they 

2312
01:36:52,391 --> 01:36:52,820
give and once you identify identified,
it's like the Matrix,

2313
01:36:53,150 --> 01:36:55,160
like you see agent Smith everywhere.
Yeah.

2314
01:36:55,490 --> 01:36:58,190
There's also a weird laziness to that.
Yes.

2315
01:36:58,300 --> 01:36:58,890
The,
the,

2316
01:36:58,900 --> 01:37:03,900
the.
There's some people that know that 

2317
01:37:03,900 --> 01:37:04,010
that's what that is and they accept it 
and they just do it anyway.

2318
01:37:04,040 --> 01:37:09,040
Right.
And then because they know they can get 

2319
01:37:09,040 --> 01:37:09,040
away with it.
Yes.

2320
01:37:09,040 --> 01:37:09,040
Yeah,
I see that in journalism too.

2321
01:37:09,040 --> 01:37:09,090
Well,
I mean the White House,

2322
01:37:09,091 --> 01:37:14,091
I mean journalism are,
they had a pullup maddow npc because 

2323
01:37:14,871 --> 01:37:17,390
there's a picture hurts that's tonight 
on MSNBC,

2324
01:37:17,391 --> 01:37:20,480
orange man.
Bad or like the angry intellectual show,

2325
01:37:20,481 --> 01:37:21,680
I think they call her.
It's,

2326
01:37:21,740 --> 01:37:26,740
it's hilarious.
And the twitter freak the fuck out and 

2327
01:37:26,740 --> 01:37:29,951
started banning a lot of these accounts 
because this is really a calling the 

2328
01:37:29,951 --> 01:37:34,871
bluff and a lot of these people like 
these twitter banned because they say 

2329
01:37:34,871 --> 01:37:34,871
it's dehumanizing.
Well,

2330
01:37:34,871 --> 01:37:35,930
they didn't give a reason,
but that's the ostensible reason,

2331
01:37:35,931 --> 01:37:40,931
theoretically sooner never explained.
It's dehumanizing to call someone a non 

2332
01:37:40,931 --> 01:37:41,510
player characters in effect.
In a way.

2333
01:37:41,511 --> 01:37:43,250
If you're saying they have no mind or 
soul,

2334
01:37:43,330 --> 01:37:45,350
but is it okay to scrawl them a basic 
bitch?

2335
01:37:46,130 --> 01:37:48,350
Yes.
Apparently it's super similar.

2336
01:37:48,380 --> 01:37:50,180
What about calling someone a fucking 
Nazi?

2337
01:37:50,540 --> 01:37:52,280
Right.
Why was that so easy?

2338
01:37:52,340 --> 01:37:53,820
Because when you're calling someone 
Nazi,

2339
01:37:53,821 --> 01:37:55,470
you are reading them effectively out of 
human race.

2340
01:37:55,471 --> 01:37:56,220
You're saying this person

2341
01:37:56,220 --> 01:37:58,930
is not deserving of any semblance of 
decency of fairness,

2342
01:37:58,940 --> 01:38:02,800
and that's not a crazy perspective.
They see ultimate subhuman designation.

2343
01:38:02,801 --> 01:38:03,600
Yeah,
yeah,

2344
01:38:03,930 --> 01:38:05,340
yeah.
It's the new n word,

2345
01:38:05,341 --> 01:38:06,110
right?
Yeah.

2346
01:38:06,450 --> 01:38:08,340
Not seeing it is,
but it's.

2347
01:38:08,350 --> 01:38:13,350
It's.
It's actually really easy to say you 

2348
01:38:13,350 --> 01:38:13,350
can't.
You can't pull it up.

2349
01:38:13,350 --> 01:38:17,280
Not the actual thing that you asked for,
but memes of her as this.

2350
01:38:17,730 --> 01:38:18,300
Yeah.
That's the one.

2351
01:38:18,301 --> 01:38:19,560
The third one.
That one.

2352
01:38:19,561 --> 01:38:20,300
That right there.
Oh,

2353
01:38:20,360 --> 01:38:23,850
well,
the outrage intellectual show.

2354
01:38:26,830 --> 01:38:31,830
What's really hilarious is listening to 
the liberals go off on her like real 

2355
01:38:31,830 --> 01:38:32,450
progressives,
like Jimmy Dore,

2356
01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:33,920
great.
Jimmy Dore,

2357
01:38:33,921 --> 01:38:35,520
Michael Tracy,
Glenn Greenwald.

2358
01:38:35,521 --> 01:38:36,900
None of them follow me.
They wish they would,

2359
01:38:36,901 --> 01:38:39,030
but they're there.
I hate when the right things.

2360
01:38:39,031 --> 01:38:40,170
Everyone.
The left's the same,

2361
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:43,500
there are many people on the left who 
are not pc,

2362
01:38:43,530 --> 01:38:46,950
who are brilliant,
who have left wing ideas and convictions

2363
01:38:47,010 --> 01:38:50,130
and they call shit out,
but the percentage of them in comparison

2364
01:38:50,131 --> 01:38:55,131
to the percentage that just follow the 
narrative is so small that we were just 

2365
01:38:55,131 --> 01:38:55,131
talking about earlier,
90 slash 10,

2366
01:38:55,131 --> 01:38:59,720
90 percent of any population are going 
to be npcs and 10 percent are going to 

2367
01:38:59,720 --> 01:38:59,720
be the innovators.

2368
01:38:59,720 --> 01:39:00,750
Yeah.
Yeah.

2369
01:39:00,840 --> 01:39:04,890
Jimmy Dore goes off on her when I'm 
doing the arduous march.

2370
01:39:04,891 --> 01:39:07,000
Me and the six friends.
It's Jay Irwin who was a four.

2371
01:39:07,001 --> 01:39:08,550
Chan Maude,
my Buddy Michael Wolf,

2372
01:39:08,551 --> 01:39:13,551
strength coach Matt,
who was an immigrant and that's a 

2373
01:39:13,551 --> 01:39:13,551
Virginia Simon's an immigrant.
My friend Paul,

2374
01:39:13,551 --> 01:39:14,250
I didn't have a name for him,
so I said,

2375
01:39:14,251 --> 01:39:16,350
you're going to be Paul and Dave Smith.
We know he's gonna.

2376
01:39:16,351 --> 01:39:18,420
Be excited from the Romney win,
and I said,

2377
01:39:19,070 --> 01:39:20,820
Paul,
I'm just going to say Paul the NPC,

2378
01:39:21,090 --> 01:39:26,090
and he immediately went out and got a 
gray sweatshirt and gray a ski to where 

2379
01:39:26,090 --> 01:39:27,840
it's.
It just looked like the name sounds very

2380
01:39:27,841 --> 01:39:28,830
proud of Paul.
What?

2381
01:39:28,831 --> 01:39:30,750
What Romney.
When I'm not aware,

2382
01:39:30,860 --> 01:39:32,710
Ronnie's the senator from Utah.
He just was.

2383
01:39:33,090 --> 01:39:38,090
He just got elected Tuesday.
How does he go from Massachusetts to 

2384
01:39:38,090 --> 01:39:38,090
Utah?
He's got,

2385
01:39:38,090 --> 01:39:38,710
he's a mormon.
He's got the matching underwear.

2386
01:39:38,720 --> 01:39:39,870
But did he move there?

2387
01:39:39,900 --> 01:39:44,900
Did he have to move there to get that?
Utah does think he lived there before 

2388
01:39:44,900 --> 01:39:44,900
Massachusetts because he ran the 
Olympics,

2389
01:39:44,900 --> 01:39:46,230
didn't he?
Out of Salt Lake.

2390
01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:48,180
I'm sure he's got.
If you're a Mormon,

2391
01:39:48,181 --> 01:39:50,340
you've got Utah Roots.
Yeah.

2392
01:39:50,820 --> 01:39:53,310
He's so reasonable in comparison to 
trump.

2393
01:39:53,370 --> 01:39:58,370
Oh,
I don't know if people would vote for 

2394
01:39:58,370 --> 01:39:58,370
him now.
I think he's going to know.

2395
01:39:58,370 --> 01:39:59,740
I think he's completely soulless and I 
don't think people look away.

2396
01:39:59,880 --> 01:40:01,440
I don't think people go for 
reasonability.

2397
01:40:01,620 --> 01:40:02,580
Uh,
he was four.

2398
01:40:02,610 --> 01:40:03,560
He,
he attack.

2399
01:40:03,570 --> 01:40:06,840
He went to the left of Ted Kennedy for 
gay marriage and he's against it.

2400
01:40:07,350 --> 01:40:09,360
He's saying Romneycare works for 
Massachusetts,

2401
01:40:09,361 --> 01:40:11,040
but it won't work for America.
What the fuck does that mean?

2402
01:40:11,160 --> 01:40:12,690
Wait a minute.
He was the,

2403
01:40:12,900 --> 01:40:15,550
to the left of Ted Kennedy when it came 
to gay marriage.

2404
01:40:15,710 --> 01:40:18,150
Look up a romney.
Ted Kennedy gay rights.

2405
01:40:18,570 --> 01:40:20,520
He asked me.
He was for gay rights.

2406
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:22,590
Then he's against it.
Pro choice pro life.

2407
01:40:22,620 --> 01:40:24,570
What was his reasoning for going against
it?

2408
01:40:24,900 --> 01:40:26,850
Because now he's running for the 
Republican presidents.

2409
01:40:27,860 --> 01:40:31,110
The guy's a fucking phony.
He's an odd duck.

2410
01:40:31,140 --> 01:40:33,840
That's for sure.
But could you not be your dad's Mexican?

2411
01:40:35,270 --> 01:40:36,430
His Dad is Mexican.
Yeah,

2412
01:40:36,440 --> 01:40:39,390
that's true.
His Dad is like born in Mexico.

2413
01:40:39,391 --> 01:40:44,391
You know what happened with his dad?
He was governor of Michigan and he was 

2414
01:40:44,391 --> 01:40:45,630
going to probably be the Republican 
nominee and 68 or 72.

2415
01:40:45,870 --> 01:40:48,090
And then he said he got brainwashed 
would.

2416
01:40:48,660 --> 01:40:49,800
Yeah.
And then it was like,

2417
01:40:49,801 --> 01:40:51,330
what the fuck does that mean?
Romney,

2418
01:40:51,331 --> 01:40:54,730
I'll be better than Ted for gay.
Nineteen 94.

2419
01:40:54,780 --> 01:40:54,990
Yep.

2420
01:40:57,220 --> 01:40:59,980
So what happened?
His Dad got brainwashed that said he was

2421
01:40:59,981 --> 01:41:01,540
brainwashed.
I don't remember.

2422
01:41:02,020 --> 01:41:04,210
I don't remember the press somebody.
And they're like,

2423
01:41:04,270 --> 01:41:06,300
are you saying you're crazy?
Yeah.

2424
01:41:06,310 --> 01:41:07,180
Yeah.
This was the thing.

2425
01:41:07,210 --> 01:41:09,070
So that did a in that did him in.
Yeah.

2426
01:41:09,071 --> 01:41:10,610
You can't say you got brainwashed.
No.

2427
01:41:10,680 --> 01:41:12,820
You got to be saying,
you got to be saying I'm impervious.

2428
01:41:12,940 --> 01:41:14,290
Yes.
Brainwashed me,

2429
01:41:14,291 --> 01:41:17,440
motherfucker.
He could look 25 percent tariff.

2430
01:41:17,480 --> 01:41:20,410
Yeah,
that's hilarious.

2431
01:41:20,411 --> 01:41:22,060
That's a great way.
Hey,

2432
01:41:22,061 --> 01:41:24,610
I got brainwashed.
It's a great way to exonerate yourself.

2433
01:41:24,700 --> 01:41:25,570
It isn't though.
It's like,

2434
01:41:25,571 --> 01:41:27,160
you know what?
I talked about this in my next book.

2435
01:41:27,230 --> 01:41:30,370
I'm when people on the left are saying 
trump is gaslighting me.

2436
01:41:31,180 --> 01:41:33,130
If your gas lit,
that means you're crazy.

2437
01:41:33,480 --> 01:41:35,890
Gas Lit means someone is making you feel
insane.

2438
01:41:35,920 --> 01:41:37,540
That's the definition of that.
Yeah.

2439
01:41:37,541 --> 01:41:39,160
I don't think they understand that.
No,

2440
01:41:39,640 --> 01:41:40,540
that's a weird term.

2441
01:41:40,780 --> 01:41:41,650
Gasoline.
I don't know.

2442
01:41:41,680 --> 01:41:43,600
I think I've ever used it.
I've only read it.

2443
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:45,520
It's been a movie.
What movie?

2444
01:41:45,970 --> 01:41:46,990
Gaslight.
Oh,

2445
01:41:46,991 --> 01:41:48,220
you didn't know where the term comes 
from.

2446
01:41:48,221 --> 01:41:53,221
There's a movie from the forties where 
the husband is trying to convince the 

2447
01:41:53,221 --> 01:41:53,221
wife.
She's going insane.

2448
01:41:53,221 --> 01:41:54,970
So he's like changing the light bulbs 
and like fucking with her head.

2449
01:41:55,270 --> 01:42:00,270
So two gas lights.
When you manipulate someone to believe 

2450
01:42:00,270 --> 01:42:02,671
they're going crazy.
So how can someone say that trump has 

2451
01:42:02,671 --> 01:42:06,010
manipulating them into believing they're
going crazy.

2452
01:42:06,340 --> 01:42:11,340
They think.
Do they think that he's making them 

2453
01:42:11,340 --> 01:42:11,770
crazy because he's just such an asshole 
that he's making them crazy?

2454
01:42:11,780 --> 01:42:16,780
Is that what you're saying?
He's such a liar that he's making me 

2455
01:42:16,780 --> 01:42:17,950
lose my sense of reality,
but,

2456
01:42:17,951 --> 01:42:22,951
but the person who's the recipient of 
gaslighting is not in a good place no 

2457
01:42:22,951 --> 01:42:23,740
matter how you cut it.
Right.

2458
01:42:24,010 --> 01:42:26,620
You're either losing touch with reality.
You're doubting things,

2459
01:42:26,621 --> 01:42:31,621
you're losing your mind.
You don't want to be that guy or that 

2460
01:42:31,621 --> 01:42:31,621
girl.
Don't give gifts.

2461
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:33,460
Yeah.
Don't get gas lit and they'll say,

2462
01:42:33,461 --> 01:42:35,590
you're getting gas lit.
That's the movie from the twenties,

2463
01:42:35,650 --> 01:42:36,490
thirties,
forties.

2464
01:42:36,491 --> 01:42:38,620
I need to go see that.
It's a brilliant idea.

2465
01:42:38,680 --> 01:42:40,680
Yeah,
it sounds like it.

2466
01:42:40,681 --> 01:42:42,190
Yeah,
it sounds funny.

2467
01:42:42,430 --> 01:42:45,130
It is hilarious.
It's funny to watch it too,

2468
01:42:45,410 --> 01:42:48,070
like the time period.
Oh yeah,

2469
01:42:48,760 --> 01:42:49,360
yeah,
yeah.

2470
01:42:49,420 --> 01:42:51,880
I think it's Ingmar Bergman.
Yeah.

2471
01:42:52,030 --> 01:42:53,350
This is a major,
major film.

2472
01:42:53,690 --> 01:42:55,570
Oh,
what a creative plot.

2473
01:42:55,840 --> 01:42:57,850
Yeah,
that is.

2474
01:42:57,910 --> 01:43:01,210
That's very creative.
You know what's the most creative show?

2475
01:43:01,211 --> 01:43:06,211
I think one of the most creative and 
innovative shows of all time is the 

2476
01:43:06,211 --> 01:43:09,001
twilight zone.
If you think about all the different 

2477
01:43:09,001 --> 01:43:09,001
premises they covered in the twilight 
zone.

2478
01:43:09,001 --> 01:43:09,730
I'm like,
good Lord.

2479
01:43:09,910 --> 01:43:12,100
What a bounty of creative ideas.

2480
01:43:12,130 --> 01:43:14,240
Right?
And every one of those was like.

2481
01:43:14,360 --> 01:43:18,100
It was like a twist and it has one every
three years.

2482
01:43:18,460 --> 01:43:21,010
They got to do it every week.
He nailed it with one.

2483
01:43:21,130 --> 01:43:24,210
He nailed it with the sixth sense and 
then after that it was like,

2484
01:43:25,480 --> 01:43:30,480
like the,
the village with all like living in a 

2485
01:43:30,480 --> 01:43:30,480
place.
Planes aren't allowed to fly over there.

2486
01:43:30,480 --> 01:43:30,580
Yeah,
right,

2487
01:43:30,640 --> 01:43:35,640
right.
You find out they're right next to a 

2488
01:43:35,640 --> 01:43:35,640
road.
You can walk to a road and a day,

2489
01:43:35,640 --> 01:43:39,061
like what?
You know how long that that's 20 miles 

2490
01:43:39,061 --> 01:43:39,061
man.
It's not that far.

2491
01:43:39,270 --> 01:43:44,270
Like you're 20 miles from people and 
you're telling me people never got to 

2492
01:43:44,270 --> 01:43:47,371
your village.
Did you guessed the ending for the 

2493
01:43:47,371 --> 01:43:47,371
success?
I guess it right away.

2494
01:43:47,371 --> 01:43:47,371
No,
I didn't.

2495
01:43:47,371 --> 01:43:47,570
Okay.
I missed it.

2496
01:43:48,300 --> 01:43:50,800
I think when you're being like,
I dunno,

2497
01:43:51,650 --> 01:43:51,980
I was just

2498
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:54,710
coming in and like.
And I guess the usual suspects also.

2499
01:43:54,980 --> 01:43:55,880
Did you?
Yeah,

2500
01:43:55,910 --> 01:44:00,910
because all those movies,
when you come in looking at it from a 

2501
01:44:00,910 --> 01:44:00,910
writer perspective,
it's like,

2502
01:44:00,910 --> 01:44:04,481
okay,
they have to show their hand in the 

2503
01:44:04,481 --> 01:44:04,481
first two minutes because then you can 
be like,

2504
01:44:04,481 --> 01:44:04,520
oh,
it's been an ally the whole time.

2505
01:44:04,521 --> 01:44:09,521
So I'm like watching him like that.
I didn't see the one where the plants 

2506
01:44:09,521 --> 01:44:10,550
come alive and killed people.
I'm sure it's retarded.

2507
01:44:10,640 --> 01:44:13,520
I'm just saying it's bad.
It's really mark Wahlberg,

2508
01:44:13,521 --> 01:44:14,320
right?
Yes.

2509
01:44:14,510 --> 01:44:16,180
Yes.
What was implanted here?

2510
01:44:16,250 --> 01:44:17,960
Who was.
Who was in planet of the apes.

2511
01:44:18,020 --> 01:44:18,520
Oh,
was he?

2512
01:44:18,550 --> 01:44:21,680
Yeah.
Was He?

2513
01:44:21,770 --> 01:44:22,520
Yes,
he was.

2514
01:44:24,440 --> 01:44:27,010
Well,
why don't you remember.

2515
01:44:27,450 --> 01:44:29,680
Do you think a child has to know the,
the,

2516
01:44:29,681 --> 01:44:32,210
the guy who played the doctor.
James Franco.

2517
01:44:33,050 --> 01:44:33,800
He played the dog.
Oh,

2518
01:44:33,801 --> 01:44:34,760
that's right.
Wasn't it?

2519
01:44:34,761 --> 01:44:35,600
I don't know.
I never saw it.

2520
01:44:35,660 --> 01:44:37,670
I know mark Wahlberg's delete and 
killing a baton.

2521
01:44:37,690 --> 01:44:38,510
Carter,
I believe.

2522
01:44:38,570 --> 01:44:40,220
Yeah.
Isn't she the,

2523
01:44:40,280 --> 01:44:42,680
the James Franco was the one who was 
trying to.

2524
01:44:42,681 --> 01:44:47,681
He trained the chimp and that's when the
chimp went crazy and he was helping the 

2525
01:44:48,081 --> 01:44:53,081
chimp.
This was going to be the first episode 

2526
01:44:53,081 --> 01:44:53,081
of Joe Rogan with that chip mentions in.
Here we go.

2527
01:44:53,081 --> 01:44:55,520
Too late.
Yeah.

2528
01:44:55,760 --> 01:44:56,840
Look at that.
Yeah.

2529
01:44:57,490 --> 01:45:00,080
It's Mucky muck.
We years this.

2530
01:45:01,190 --> 01:45:02,600
Oh,
it's the other one.

2531
01:45:02,660 --> 01:45:05,440
First one.
The first and the.

2532
01:45:05,870 --> 01:45:09,200
When they brought it back.
Really pretty sure.

2533
01:45:09,620 --> 01:45:10,280
Yeah,
there it is.

2534
01:45:10,310 --> 01:45:11,840
Wow.
Look at the image,

2535
01:45:11,870 --> 01:45:14,740
the 2001 right above that,
the one to the right of that.

2536
01:45:14,780 --> 01:45:16,820
Like that.
I to look at that.

2537
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:19,000
And that's good makeup.
Fuck yeah,

2538
01:45:19,001 --> 01:45:21,170
it is probably a little bit of CGI,
right?

2539
01:45:21,171 --> 01:45:22,790
It's still impressive.
No,

2540
01:45:22,791 --> 01:45:26,510
it's totally amazing.
That's crazy that that was 2001.

2541
01:45:27,290 --> 01:45:29,030
That's right.
That's right.

2542
01:45:29,330 --> 01:45:30,620
So there's that.

2543
01:45:32,280 --> 01:45:37,280
I feel like this was a totally different
one than the one that was from 2010.

2544
01:45:38,311 --> 01:45:43,311
Like almost like it was a reboot,
like I don't think they were the same 

2545
01:45:43,311 --> 01:45:43,311
probably.
I think that.

2546
01:45:43,311 --> 01:45:45,000
I think that's true.
I don't think that it's the universe.

2547
01:45:45,090 --> 01:45:50,090
Yeah,
I think it's just totally different 

2548
01:45:50,090 --> 01:45:50,090
thing.
Wasn't this Tim Burton?

2549
01:45:50,090 --> 01:45:50,090
It was Tim Burton.
Yeah.

2550
01:45:50,090 --> 01:45:51,900
Yeah.
So in this one,

2551
01:45:52,350 --> 01:45:57,350
marky mark comes to the future and finds
the plant of the apes and the whole 

2552
01:45:57,350 --> 01:45:58,680
deal.
But in the next one,

2553
01:45:58,681 --> 01:46:01,560
the next reboot,
which was the James Franco one,

2554
01:46:01,860 --> 01:46:05,790
James Franco is a part of the actual 
medical experiments at turn.

2555
01:46:06,120 --> 01:46:07,740
Caesar's,
like a prequel.

2556
01:46:07,800 --> 01:46:09,900
Yeah,
that's what it was.

2557
01:46:10,590 --> 01:46:12,180
There's been a lot of planet of the apes
movies.

2558
01:46:12,181 --> 01:46:14,220
People are Goddamn.
Except there we are,

2559
01:46:14,221 --> 01:46:16,740
we are like really obsessed with 
chimpanzees.

2560
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:19,320
I can't wait for the crossover with the 
Muslim Brotherhood movie.

2561
01:46:19,830 --> 01:46:20,690
I don't think they're going to do that.

2562
01:46:20,690 --> 01:46:22,080
I'm going to call it.
Call it barrel aged.

2563
01:46:22,081 --> 01:46:27,081
Valerie Jarrett,
I think once they canceled the connors 

2564
01:46:27,081 --> 01:46:29,330
that went out,
they got into vine in development.

2565
01:46:29,701 --> 01:46:32,490
Hell 10 years in between.
Yeah,

2566
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:34,050
that's what it is.
The.

2567
01:46:34,051 --> 01:46:38,180
So the,
the one that took place on 2011.

2568
01:46:38,500 --> 01:46:40,230
Look at that of them.
Okay.

2569
01:46:40,320 --> 01:46:45,320
Yeah.
Then that one was the one where they 

2570
01:46:45,320 --> 01:46:45,350
explained the rise of the planet.
Yeah.

2571
01:46:45,351 --> 01:46:50,351
Yeah.
They give them the injection and the 

2572
01:46:50,351 --> 01:46:50,351
chimp gets super smart and their changed
color.

2573
01:46:50,351 --> 01:46:52,260
There's little member's eyes turned 
blue,

2574
01:46:53,160 --> 01:46:54,830
which is racist.
Racist.

2575
01:46:55,180 --> 01:46:57,570
You have to be blue eyed by smart.
Fuck.

2576
01:46:57,930 --> 01:46:59,490
Thank you.
Thank you.

2577
01:46:59,491 --> 01:47:00,820
It's appreciate it means something to 
them.

2578
01:47:00,840 --> 01:47:02,190
Right?
Um,

2579
01:47:02,790 --> 01:47:06,090
what were we talking about when we got 
to plant of the apes?

2580
01:47:06,150 --> 01:47:06,660
Like what?

2581
01:47:08,870 --> 01:47:11,970
Sean Shama Lama Ding Dong.
He had a few of the highlights on.

2582
01:47:11,971 --> 01:47:13,090
You were talking about,
you know,

2583
01:47:13,100 --> 01:47:15,000
what one movie that he had that's good 
though,

2584
01:47:15,090 --> 01:47:18,420
that people don't talk about is devil.
That's when the elevator,

2585
01:47:18,421 --> 01:47:19,110
right?
Yeah,

2586
01:47:19,111 --> 01:47:20,490
definitely worth watching.
I haven't seen it.

2587
01:47:20,491 --> 01:47:23,250
I enjoyed that.
That's one of my facebook banner picks.

2588
01:47:23,251 --> 01:47:25,380
It's me in front of the movie poster for
Devil.

2589
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:26,940
Yeah.
Okay.

2590
01:47:27,450 --> 01:47:28,710
That was not bad.
Yeah.

2591
01:47:28,711 --> 01:47:33,711
If you're.
If you're looking for a dumb horror 

2592
01:47:33,711 --> 01:47:33,711
movie,
it's like fun though.

2593
01:47:33,711 --> 01:47:33,711
There was bad.
I actually,

2594
01:47:33,780 --> 01:47:35,190
Chrissy Tiegen,
I don't know who she is,

2595
01:47:35,191 --> 01:47:36,810
but she's famous.
She's got a lot of twitter.

2596
01:47:37,020 --> 01:47:39,120
One of those ones that I couldn't 
recognize her.

2597
01:47:39,530 --> 01:47:44,530
I couldn't pick her out of a lineup and 
she's famous and this isn't a knock on 

2598
01:47:44,530 --> 01:47:44,530
her.
I just saying personally,

2599
01:47:44,530 --> 01:47:45,360
I don't know who she is,
but she's out of the loop.

2600
01:47:45,690 --> 01:47:46,940
She tweeted out that,
you know,

2601
01:47:46,950 --> 01:47:51,950
after thinking all this time,
I'm going to vote for the Democrats and 

2602
01:47:51,950 --> 01:47:51,950
I just retweeted.
I go,

2603
01:47:51,950 --> 01:47:52,680
yeah.
Directly by that channel.

2604
01:47:52,740 --> 01:47:55,860
There's a twist ending Hollywood lady 
votes for Democrats.

2605
01:47:56,100 --> 01:48:00,570
After thinking all this time,
I've been thinking for a 14 minute.

2606
01:48:02,220 --> 01:48:07,220
What does that mean?
Everything thinking all this time I've 

2607
01:48:07,220 --> 01:48:07,220
watched a few can.
Oh,

2608
01:48:07,220 --> 01:48:09,390
and speeches and I'm not totally.
I'm just not sold.

2609
01:48:09,420 --> 01:48:12,270
Did you know Konya?
Had some good points,

2610
01:48:12,271 --> 01:48:17,271
but I don't know.
Did you see the Qantas Owens and Tomi 

2611
01:48:17,271 --> 01:48:20,870
Lahren?
We're getting into it on twitter today 

2612
01:48:20,870 --> 01:48:20,870
now.
Like two weeks ago.

2613
01:48:20,870 --> 01:48:21,160
I missed it.
It was this big cat fight.

2614
01:48:21,300 --> 01:48:22,020
Really?
Yeah,

2615
01:48:22,021 --> 01:48:24,600
it was hilarious.
Would they say like,

2616
01:48:24,601 --> 01:48:26,700
Tommy's was subtweeting her.
She wouldn't use her name.

2617
01:48:26,730 --> 01:48:27,510
She goes,
Oh,

2618
01:48:27,511 --> 01:48:28,500
you know,
bla bla bla bla bla.

2619
01:48:28,501 --> 01:48:31,380
And candice is like,
Tommy Comma,

2620
01:48:31,860 --> 01:48:36,860
like,
you're jealous because your career is a 

2621
01:48:36,860 --> 01:48:36,860
disaster,
blah,

2622
01:48:36,860 --> 01:48:36,860
blah,
blah,

2623
01:48:36,860 --> 01:48:36,860
blah.

2624
01:48:36,860 --> 01:48:36,860
Yeah,
it was,

2625
01:48:36,860 --> 01:48:37,440
it was beef,
but at the,

2626
01:48:37,450 --> 01:48:42,450
on the same extensively turned on.
Candice throw her under the bus.

2627
01:48:43,200 --> 01:48:44,160
Oh yeah.
Oh,

2628
01:48:44,190 --> 01:48:45,840
Kanye turned on candice.
Oh yeah.

2629
01:48:45,841 --> 01:48:48,270
He says I'm not involved in.
I'm not involved in politics anymore.

2630
01:48:48,500 --> 01:48:50,100
Right,
but how's that turning on canvas?

2631
01:48:50,110 --> 01:48:52,320
Because she could.
She just heard the name and the tweets.

2632
01:48:52,440 --> 01:48:53,430
What he say.
He said,

2633
01:48:53,431 --> 01:48:54,510
candice,
whatever.

2634
01:48:54,520 --> 01:48:57,030
I'll find the tweet if you want.
But so she was,

2635
01:48:57,270 --> 01:48:59,670
I don't want to speak for her,
but she launched this whole brexit thing

2636
01:48:59,700 --> 01:49:02,520
and basically implied that he was 
involved and he's like,

2637
01:49:02,521 --> 01:49:04,800
I'm not.
I've been used by people in politics and

2638
01:49:04,801 --> 01:49:05,840
not doing it well.
Look at her.

2639
01:49:05,870 --> 01:49:07,260
She.
She wasn't a hard.

2640
01:49:07,290 --> 01:49:09,300
Oh yeah,
they both to turn on Kanye.

2641
01:49:09,301 --> 01:49:12,450
Now the ship was doomed to sync from the
start,

2642
01:49:12,451 --> 01:49:15,780
but hunger for fame and money was placed
over the movement.

2643
01:49:15,990 --> 01:49:20,990
Funny how he was a free thinker in 
quotes before and now he's a trader and 

2644
01:49:21,681 --> 01:49:25,110
quotes sounds a lot like a tactic of the
left.

2645
01:49:25,320 --> 01:49:27,770
I liked how she capitalized left.
Yeah.

2646
01:49:28,200 --> 01:49:32,140
You made your bed now lie in it.
I think he was laying.

2647
01:49:32,520 --> 01:49:33,090
Laying,
right?

2648
01:49:33,120 --> 01:49:35,130
Yeah.
Well maybe not.

2649
01:49:35,320 --> 01:49:40,320
Maybe it's a double entendre or maybe 
maybe it'd be in factual.

2650
01:49:42,900 --> 01:49:47,900
Tommy.
I think I can speak on behalf of people 

2651
01:49:47,900 --> 01:49:52,200
on both sides of the political aisle and
say we're sorry about your failed 

2652
01:49:52,200 --> 01:49:54,100
career.
That this is hilarious.

2653
01:49:54,190 --> 01:49:57,910
She's saying this.
She's literally had a career in this for

2654
01:49:57,970 --> 01:50:01,390
about eight months and you're failed 
career.

2655
01:50:01,600 --> 01:50:03,850
You know,
she used to run an anti-trump website.

2656
01:50:03,940 --> 01:50:05,270
A excite you mean?
Yeah,

2657
01:50:05,310 --> 01:50:05,710
yeah,
yeah.

2658
01:50:06,550 --> 01:50:11,550
The desperation to be relevant again by 
constantly saving me and slash or 

2659
01:50:12,161 --> 01:50:17,161
attacking Kathy Griffin weekly.
Make sure it doesn't bode well for any 

2660
01:50:17,381 --> 01:50:18,820
movement.
Grow Up.

2661
01:50:18,821 --> 01:50:20,290
Whenever anyone writes,
grow up.

2662
01:50:20,291 --> 01:50:21,820
I always hear it in cartons voice.

2663
01:50:24,460 --> 01:50:26,170
Is that it?
Did they go out into the further?

2664
01:50:26,200 --> 01:50:28,540
Always was just one little bit of back 
and forth.

2665
01:50:28,560 --> 01:50:30,660
Yeah.
That's so silly.

2666
01:50:31,230 --> 01:50:36,230
Oh,
Owen's went on the defensive Wednesday 

2667
01:50:36,230 --> 01:50:38,491
after West rejected claims that he 
designed or created by Lexit tee shirts.

2668
01:50:40,330 --> 01:50:41,500
What is black,
black,

2669
01:50:41,540 --> 01:50:43,510
black lives they could show to called a 
black set?

2670
01:50:44,470 --> 01:50:49,470
Yeah.
Like they mean the blacks leaving the 

2671
01:50:49,470 --> 01:50:49,470
Democratic Party.
And why didn't they do that?

2672
01:50:49,470 --> 01:50:52,780
I don't.
You'd have to ask candice and our Kanye 

2673
01:50:52,780 --> 01:50:52,780
and our.
Kathy Griffin.

2674
01:50:52,930 --> 01:50:57,930
Yeah.
Well I get they did it because of 

2675
01:50:57,930 --> 01:50:57,930
brexit.
Yeah,

2676
01:50:57,930 --> 01:50:57,930
but black.
It's center.

2677
01:50:57,930 --> 01:50:58,840
Yeah.
Yeah.

2678
01:51:00,160 --> 01:51:01,660
Below.
That's not bad.

2679
01:51:01,690 --> 01:51:03,880
Black exit.
Yeah,

2680
01:51:03,910 --> 01:51:06,900
but black state is also black exit.
Yeah.

2681
01:51:06,901 --> 01:51:09,580
It's called blaxploitation movies.
Right.

2682
01:51:09,581 --> 01:51:14,581
But exit is spelled e x I t and if you 
just have bel and then fix it,

2683
01:51:14,861 --> 01:51:16,660
it's actually better.
I,

2684
01:51:17,210 --> 01:51:19,840
if you want to be sure precisely 
spelling is better,

2685
01:51:19,841 --> 01:51:21,460
but in terms of how,
how it said,

2686
01:51:21,461 --> 01:51:22,900
I think blacks,
it sounds lacks it.

2687
01:51:23,070 --> 01:51:27,700
I have to opposite.
I don't think either.

2688
01:51:27,790 --> 01:51:32,790
You don't have to create exit,
you just keep exiting there and just be 

2689
01:51:32,790 --> 01:51:34,120
all the beginning of it and it works or 
it flex.

2690
01:51:34,150 --> 01:51:35,620
It also works.
Let's.

2691
01:51:35,850 --> 01:51:38,540
I've sure candace think you're married 
to your idea of blacks.

2692
01:51:38,541 --> 01:51:41,140
It's needed to let it go.
You're a writer.

2693
01:51:41,141 --> 01:51:44,110
You know how to kill your babies.
I don't have any black vaping's.

2694
01:51:44,240 --> 01:51:47,170
No excavating writing.
You kill your darlings.

2695
01:51:47,171 --> 01:51:49,420
Kill your darling.
Kill your shitty ideas.

2696
01:51:49,600 --> 01:51:50,740
Yeah,
blacks.

2697
01:51:50,741 --> 01:51:52,930
It's a shitty idea.
Black sit is where it's at.

2698
01:51:52,990 --> 01:51:53,770
Is it?
Yeah.

2699
01:51:53,771 --> 01:51:54,970
Brexit.
Brexit.

2700
01:51:55,270 --> 01:51:57,400
They were right.
Do you think that this is gonna be a lot

2701
01:51:57,401 --> 01:52:02,401
of people,
black people leaving the Democratic 

2702
01:52:02,401 --> 01:52:02,401
Party?
I don't think so.

2703
01:52:02,401 --> 01:52:02,401
Yeah.
No,

2704
01:52:02,401 --> 01:52:06,600
I think there's going to be a few that 
recognize that it's a genuine pathway to

2705
01:52:06,641 --> 01:52:08,590
attention and I think there's going to 
be.

2706
01:52:08,590 --> 01:52:10,300
A lot of people are going to sit home.
Yeah.

2707
01:52:10,301 --> 01:52:12,340
That's what African American.
There's a few.

2708
01:52:12,370 --> 01:52:15,430
Listen,
there's a few on both sides of the aisle

2709
01:52:15,460 --> 01:52:18,490
that are contrarians,
hucksters,

2710
01:52:18,550 --> 01:52:23,550
you know,
there's just two different types of 

2711
01:52:23,550 --> 01:52:25,270
posts.
The contrarians are people that don't 

2712
01:52:25,270 --> 01:52:27,451
like the fact that they are being told 
that as an African American I have to 

2713
01:52:27,451 --> 01:52:29,500
vote Democrat and I have to lean left 
and they're like,

2714
01:52:29,501 --> 01:52:30,730
fuck this,
you know,

2715
01:52:30,910 --> 01:52:32,620
you don't tell me what to do.
And then they go that way.

2716
01:52:32,650 --> 01:52:37,650
I think we're getting a little bit of 
that from Kanye West and then there's 

2717
01:52:37,650 --> 01:52:40,300
people that recognize that there is,
there's legitimate pathway to start them

2718
01:52:40,570 --> 01:52:43,270
to attention to,
you know,

2719
01:52:43,600 --> 01:52:48,600
it's just a,
it's a career in being like reciting 

2720
01:52:48,600 --> 01:52:50,000
conservative talking points as an 
African American.

2721
01:52:50,030 --> 01:52:50,500
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

2722
01:52:51,050 --> 01:52:53,250
I mean it's an affirmative action.
Yeah.

2723
01:52:53,900 --> 01:52:56,030
But it's um,
and especially,

2724
01:52:56,420 --> 01:53:01,420
you know,
if you can get a little juice on some 

2725
01:53:01,420 --> 01:53:04,520
sort of argument with some Tommy Lauren 
check or any of these.

2726
01:53:04,820 --> 01:53:06,440
I was confused.
Her and Lauren Southern,

2727
01:53:06,950 --> 01:53:08,210
they're very different.
I know,

2728
01:53:08,211 --> 01:53:10,840
but they're both hot.
They're both hot plates on.

2729
01:53:11,030 --> 01:53:16,030
That's all I say.
I'm not really paying attention to what 

2730
01:53:16,030 --> 01:53:16,030
they're saying.
Well,

2731
01:53:16,030 --> 01:53:16,490
I don't think that's fair to Lauren.
How dare you.

2732
01:53:16,670 --> 01:53:21,670
What do you mean had there has,
is lauren the superior to the title?

2733
01:53:22,520 --> 01:53:23,650
I'm not going to,
I mean,

2734
01:53:23,660 --> 01:53:26,000
if I wouldn't have said not fair to 
Lauren,

2735
01:53:26,001 --> 01:53:28,430
so lauren is better than Tommy.
Uh,

2736
01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:33,800
I think Lauren,
Tommy is very much someone who's there 

2737
01:53:33,800 --> 01:53:35,930
to have a,
a standard Republican point of view.

2738
01:53:35,980 --> 01:53:40,980
What she does well and is that lauren is
more of kind of a filmmaker and she's 

2739
01:53:40,980 --> 01:53:41,480
much edgier.
I mean,

2740
01:53:41,481 --> 01:53:43,520
she's,
she went with Molyneux to Australia.

2741
01:53:43,521 --> 01:53:47,630
There was all this beef beef about going
Australia,

2742
01:53:47,660 --> 01:53:50,120
like they wanted to stop their talks.
Uh,

2743
01:53:50,600 --> 01:53:52,580
she's done.
She's going to South Africa to do work.

2744
01:53:52,580 --> 01:53:54,030
They want to stop that.
Everybody's talks,

2745
01:53:54,031 --> 01:53:59,031
they want to stop Tommy's talks to.
They want to start stock of lawrence 

2746
01:53:59,031 --> 01:53:59,810
onto more controversial and more 
controversial.

2747
01:53:59,840 --> 01:54:00,770
Yeah,
yeah,

2748
01:54:00,771 --> 01:54:03,410
yeah.
She's very anti anti immigrant.

2749
01:54:03,411 --> 01:54:06,080
She went to Europe to see the migrant 
camps.

2750
01:54:06,450 --> 01:54:09,500
Um,
so you're not going to see Lauren really

2751
01:54:09,501 --> 01:54:11,330
on these mainstream outlets.
Um,

2752
01:54:11,930 --> 01:54:16,670
well I know Lauren was referenced in a 
lot of the discussions that I was having

2753
01:54:16,671 --> 01:54:21,671
with people on twitter about people in 
South Africa who are farmers getting 

2754
01:54:21,771 --> 01:54:22,310
murdered.
Right.

2755
01:54:22,311 --> 01:54:24,740
She had a documentary called farmlands.
Yeah.

2756
01:54:25,160 --> 01:54:30,160
Yeah.
That was a weird one where people were 

2757
01:54:30,160 --> 01:54:31,490
getting angry at me and saying that I 
was reciting a racist conspiracy theory.

2758
01:54:31,491 --> 01:54:32,270
I'm like,
okay,

2759
01:54:32,630 --> 01:54:37,630
but this is a racist conspiracy theory 
that a black person was talking about in

2760
01:54:37,791 --> 01:54:40,310
front of Congress.
I mean,

2761
01:54:41,480 --> 01:54:46,010
this is a black African guy talking 
about it on television in Africa,

2762
01:54:46,011 --> 01:54:47,960
the problems with farm murders,
you know,

2763
01:54:48,080 --> 01:54:52,290
and then there was that guy who was the 
one who wants reparations,

2764
01:54:52,291 --> 01:54:57,200
who was in South Africa,
who's a very controversial character,

2765
01:54:57,410 --> 01:54:57,890
who was.

2766
01:54:58,100 --> 01:55:03,100
He was kicked out of one of their 
organizations for doing a song singing 

2767
01:55:03,100 --> 01:55:04,640
about killed the board.
Yes,

2768
01:55:05,090 --> 01:55:10,090
he's doing it and making guns sounds and
the audience is cheering around along 

2769
01:55:10,090 --> 01:55:13,010
with his song with gun sounds,
and it's about killing farmers.

2770
01:55:13,011 --> 01:55:18,011
The term conspiracy theory is a tactic 
that the press and people use to shut 

2771
01:55:18,321 --> 01:55:20,090
down conversation.
If you think about it,

2772
01:55:20,270 --> 01:55:22,370
Harvey Weinstein was a conspiracy 
theory.

2773
01:55:22,430 --> 01:55:25,850
Bill cosby was a conspiracy theory.
Kevin Spacey was a conspiracy theory.

2774
01:55:25,880 --> 01:55:30,230
Everyone knew everyone and everyone kept
their mouth shut.

2775
01:55:30,310 --> 01:55:35,310
Yeah,
so the idea that a conspiracy theories 

2776
01:55:35,310 --> 01:55:37,330
inherently false is itself inherently 
false and it's just a way to stigmatize 

2777
01:55:37,330 --> 01:55:38,300
a school of thought or an idea that you 
don't want to talk about.

2778
01:55:38,720 --> 01:55:43,720
Well,
it's also labeling it as a racist 

2779
01:55:43,720 --> 01:55:43,720
ideologies.
That's true too.

2780
01:55:43,720 --> 01:55:43,720
Yeah.
You,

2781
01:55:43,720 --> 01:55:44,460
you are immediately

2782
01:55:44,470 --> 01:55:47,850
rate and they also.
It was because of trump reciting it.

2783
01:55:48,390 --> 01:55:53,390
Trump had repeated it on television 
talking about something in terms of the 

2784
01:55:53,581 --> 01:55:55,930
issue with South African farmers.
It's,

2785
01:55:56,130 --> 01:56:01,130
but it's one of those things that we 
were talking about before where even if 

2786
01:56:01,130 --> 01:56:01,320
they know that the narrative is not 
true,

2787
01:56:01,530 --> 01:56:06,530
it supports what they're trying to push 
so they run with it and so I just kept 

2788
01:56:07,291 --> 01:56:12,291
doubling down.
I kept posting all these different 

2789
01:56:12,291 --> 01:56:12,291
things about it.
I was like,

2790
01:56:12,291 --> 01:56:12,291
well,
what about this guy talking about it?

2791
01:56:12,291 --> 01:56:13,010
What about this?
What about here's,

2792
01:56:13,070 --> 01:56:18,070
here's some instances of these murders,
and then there's also the reality of 

2793
01:56:18,070 --> 01:56:19,830
South Africa in general,
which is extremely violent.

2794
01:56:20,010 --> 01:56:25,010
There's a lot of violence and there's a 
lot of crime and some of it has to do 

2795
01:56:25,010 --> 01:56:29,661
with the fact that these people that are
in these farms are targets because 

2796
01:56:29,661 --> 01:56:32,841
they're out in the middle of nowhere and
whether or not it's racist that they're 

2797
01:56:32,841 --> 01:56:34,110
going after them because they're white.

2798
01:56:34,290 --> 01:56:39,290
That's debatable,
but black farmers are also getting 

2799
01:56:39,290 --> 01:56:40,200
attacked.
It's not simply just white farmers.

2800
01:56:40,560 --> 01:56:43,600
There is some of that though,
but there's some of that.

2801
01:56:43,730 --> 01:56:47,310
Some of them are going after these 
farmers because they're white and this.

2802
01:56:47,500 --> 01:56:52,500
The thing that's really disturbing is 
are people that people are happier if 

2803
01:56:52,500 --> 01:56:53,220
this is black people killing other black
people like the Hutu and the Tutsis.

2804
01:56:53,221 --> 01:56:58,221
That was the genocide and so yeah,
it's a problem when people are being 

2805
01:56:58,221 --> 01:57:00,750
killed regardless of their race and 
tribalism cuts across racial lines,

2806
01:57:00,780 --> 01:57:02,790
but on the other side there was also 
some,

2807
01:57:02,970 --> 01:57:06,120
some legitimate claims to land that was 
stolen,

2808
01:57:06,330 --> 01:57:11,330
stolen during apartheid,
and that the people who are alive today 

2809
01:57:11,330 --> 01:57:13,230
who might not have been around during 
the stealing of that land,

2810
01:57:13,231 --> 01:57:15,150
are benefiting from the fact that 
they're.

2811
01:57:15,450 --> 01:57:18,870
They're living on stolen land.
Like that's all legitimate as well.

2812
01:57:19,050 --> 01:57:22,920
So there's legitimate arguments in terms
of like how the land was procured in the

2813
01:57:22,921 --> 01:57:25,110
first place and how the person who's 
owning it today,

2814
01:57:25,290 --> 01:57:26,430
how they came to own it.

2815
01:57:26,790 --> 01:57:27,970
So there's,
it's,

2816
01:57:27,990 --> 01:57:30,180
it's complex,
it's very complex,

2817
01:57:30,181 --> 01:57:34,470
but it also has to do with this culture 
of violence in Africa in general,

2818
01:57:34,710 --> 01:57:39,710
especially particularly in South Africa 
where there's a lot of poverty and you 

2819
01:57:39,710 --> 01:57:43,341
know,
these people who are out in these farms 

2820
01:57:43,341 --> 01:57:46,491
in the middle of their targets,
people don't what politics from both 

2821
01:57:46,741 --> 01:57:50,700
sides who wants to teach us is that 
policy things that never complex,

2822
01:57:50,760 --> 01:57:55,760
right?
So if you have your little package and 

2823
01:57:55,760 --> 01:57:56,190
some things doesn't fit in that package,
you don't know what to make of it.

2824
01:57:56,191 --> 01:58:01,191
So you want to dismiss it because then 
you're going to have to do the work of 

2825
01:58:01,191 --> 01:58:01,191
reconsidering your,
uh,

2826
01:58:01,191 --> 01:58:05,540
assumptions and certainly don't discuss 
it publicly where you could be 

2827
01:58:05,540 --> 01:58:08,991
misconstrued or labeled as a racist.
And I was looking at all these people 

2828
01:58:08,991 --> 01:58:09,480
labeling me as a racist.
I was like,

2829
01:58:09,481 --> 01:58:10,650
okay,
I see what you're doing,

2830
01:58:10,651 --> 01:58:15,651
but I'm just going to keep posting these
things because this is all what I'm 

2831
01:58:15,651 --> 01:58:19,641
saying is all being substantiated by a 
bunch of different people were also 

2832
01:58:19,641 --> 01:58:23,691
black in South Africa like this.
This is a lot of what this discussion 

2833
01:58:23,691 --> 01:58:28,370
revolves around.
What trump's done is had had that word 

2834
01:58:28,370 --> 01:58:30,420
lose a lot of its meaning because like 
if you just throw that term around Willy

2835
01:58:30,420 --> 01:58:31,380
Nilly,
then a certain point it's like,

2836
01:58:31,381 --> 01:58:34,050
okay,
it's the boy who cried wolf and the term

2837
01:58:34,051 --> 01:58:39,051
is a very broad term.
It someone's grandma's prejudice and 

2838
01:58:39,051 --> 01:58:39,051
says,
I don't want my grandkids,

2839
01:58:39,051 --> 01:58:43,220
you know,
dating a black person that's not the 

2840
01:58:43,220 --> 01:58:43,220
same as advocating genocide

2841
01:58:43,220 --> 01:58:47,010
and they're both racist,
but you can't regard them as synonymous 

2842
01:58:47,010 --> 01:58:47,010
at one.
Doesn't necessarily lead to the other.

2843
01:58:47,710 --> 01:58:48,970
Yeah,
yeah.

2844
01:58:48,971 --> 01:58:53,971
It's the fact that racism.
I mean I think that racism has probably 

2845
01:58:54,521 --> 01:58:59,521
diminished somewhat.
Would you agree with that in terms of 

2846
01:58:59,521 --> 01:59:00,240
like between now and say like when we 
were.

2847
01:59:00,320 --> 01:59:01,290
What year were you born?
[inaudible]?

2848
01:59:01,291 --> 01:59:04,480
Seventy six.
Do you think from 1976 to 2018?

2849
01:59:04,530 --> 01:59:07,240
Racism in this country is diminished or 
enormously?

2850
01:59:07,540 --> 01:59:08,500
Enormously.
Yes,

2851
01:59:08,501 --> 01:59:10,290
I think so.
I think it's.

2852
01:59:10,470 --> 01:59:11,770
I,
I'm from Brooklyn,

2853
01:59:11,830 --> 01:59:16,830
right?
So I don't really have friends who are 

2854
01:59:16,830 --> 01:59:17,110
like waspy white people.
I can't imagine a situation where people

2855
01:59:17,111 --> 01:59:19,990
are hanging out and saying racist 
things.

2856
01:59:20,480 --> 01:59:22,110
Connecticut.
No,

2857
01:59:22,120 --> 01:59:23,920
but I mean I can't imagine them sitting 
race thing.

2858
01:59:23,930 --> 01:59:25,540
Everyone's looking at them like they're 
not crazy.

2859
01:59:25,810 --> 01:59:30,280
Like it would just be so shocking and I 
think 40 years ago that wouldn't be that

2860
01:59:30,281 --> 01:59:30,760
uncommon.

2861
01:59:30,880 --> 01:59:35,880
It would happen.
I think there's also the reality of 

2862
01:59:35,880 --> 01:59:39,661
social media is that there are 
absolutely real repercussions for any 

2863
01:59:40,511 --> 01:59:43,000
sort of racist out al.
Yes.

2864
01:59:43,840 --> 01:59:46,870
AnYthing you say?
Anything that's any,

2865
01:59:46,890 --> 01:59:51,890
any outburst,
anything that you say that in terms of 

2866
01:59:51,890 --> 01:59:56,761
like dis you could if you're somewhere 
and you say something publicly that's 

2867
01:59:56,891 --> 02:00:01,891
racist,
someone could tweet that and it will 

2868
02:00:01,891 --> 02:00:03,040
ruin your life so we could post that on 
facebook and it would ruin your life and

2869
02:00:03,041 --> 02:00:08,041
I think that keeps legitimate racists 
from being as out with it,

2870
02:00:08,410 --> 02:00:12,910
which reduces racism overall because I 
think when less people are doing it,

2871
02:00:13,240 --> 02:00:18,240
it seems less culturally acceptable and 
then people change the way they think,

2872
02:00:18,820 --> 02:00:23,820
but it's also.
It's eAsier to be racist when you're 

2873
02:00:23,820 --> 02:00:26,041
only talking to people who are like you,
but if you're interacting with people 

2874
02:00:26,041 --> 02:00:26,041
from all over the world and you're like,
okay,

2875
02:00:26,041 --> 02:00:28,060
this guy's a putz,
but he's also like the people I know.

2876
02:00:28,060 --> 02:00:33,060
It's very hard to maintain that 
prejudice when you're seeing people who 

2877
02:00:33,060 --> 02:00:36,691
are acting similar to you because it's 
anonymous behind the screen and if they 

2878
02:00:36,691 --> 02:00:36,691
turn out to be black.
I was like,

2879
02:00:36,691 --> 02:00:37,060
okay,
this guy's not different for me.

2880
02:00:37,360 --> 02:00:42,360
Yeah.
That's the interesting difference 

2881
02:00:42,360 --> 02:00:43,981
between New York and los angeles is the 
fact that in New York everybody 

2882
02:00:43,981 --> 02:00:46,690
integrates with everybody on the street.
They're all walking together,

2883
02:00:46,691 --> 02:00:49,780
they're all getting on subways together.
They're in buildings together.

2884
02:00:49,781 --> 02:00:54,781
Everybody's walking around together like
it's all black and white and brown and 

2885
02:00:54,781 --> 02:00:56,260
yellow and everybody's together and la 
man,

2886
02:00:56,261 --> 02:00:59,650
everyone is in their cars and they'd go 
from cars to their houses.

2887
02:00:59,651 --> 02:01:03,700
They go for their houses to their work 
and there's a lot of segregation just in

2888
02:01:03,701 --> 02:01:08,701
terms of people just not interacting 
with other people in a normal day to day

2889
02:01:08,951 --> 02:01:12,050
commuter type situation.
That my second favorite city,

2890
02:01:12,100 --> 02:01:17,100
even better than New York about this,
which is toronto because everyone's 

2891
02:01:17,100 --> 02:01:17,470
walking on the street,
looks like the un,

2892
02:01:17,490 --> 02:01:18,080
so it's.

2893
02:01:18,190 --> 02:01:20,560
And they're very,
very integrated and very cool.

2894
02:01:20,561 --> 02:01:22,390
I love that city.
That's a great city.

2895
02:01:22,410 --> 02:01:24,820
Yeah,
it's too fucking cold.

2896
02:01:25,140 --> 02:01:27,430
I've never been there in the winter,
so I've been there in the winter.

2897
02:01:27,930 --> 02:01:29,480
Is that bad?
It's rough.

2898
02:01:29,550 --> 02:01:31,000
OkAy.
It's fucking cold,

2899
02:01:31,180 --> 02:01:33,700
but.
But it's a really great city.

2900
02:01:33,990 --> 02:01:36,370
That's.
That was the last stop on my tour.

2901
02:01:36,450 --> 02:01:38,740
Oh,
before my netflix special was toronto.

2902
02:01:39,170 --> 02:01:41,330
When you're in toronto and you're from 
brooklyn,

2903
02:01:41,360 --> 02:01:43,520
you are the coolest person in the whole 
city.

2904
02:01:43,530 --> 02:01:44,760
Everyone,
I tell you,

2905
02:01:44,761 --> 02:01:46,750
like at least five or six people made a 
point telling me like,

2906
02:01:46,760 --> 02:01:47,360
oh,
you're from brooklyn.

2907
02:01:47,650 --> 02:01:49,580
Oh,
I've been to williamsburg and I'm like,

2908
02:01:49,581 --> 02:01:50,990
do you think this is like you're a 
mecca,

2909
02:01:51,020 --> 02:01:53,510
like there's a giant stone cube that 
you're all worship thing.

2910
02:01:54,450 --> 02:01:56,990
And the brooklyn pizza in toronto is 
excellent.

2911
02:01:57,110 --> 02:01:58,970
I went in there and being like,
you guys are assholes.

2912
02:01:58,970 --> 02:01:59,780
I try to go,
nope.

2913
02:01:59,960 --> 02:02:01,190
Excellent.
And oh,

2914
02:02:01,191 --> 02:02:03,740
speaking of innovation,
there's this restaurant there called the

2915
02:02:03,741 --> 02:02:04,910
black hook.
How did you go?

2916
02:02:05,060 --> 02:02:07,810
No,
they take awful meet f a l,

2917
02:02:07,820 --> 02:02:12,820
Oregon meat,
and they make it all gourmet and 

2918
02:02:12,820 --> 02:02:15,191
amazing.
And I was there and like the creativity 

2919
02:02:15,191 --> 02:02:15,191
in every dish.
I was like,

2920
02:02:15,191 --> 02:02:15,191
holy shit,
this place is amazing.

2921
02:02:15,191 --> 02:02:16,060
Oh,
interesting.

2922
02:02:16,070 --> 02:02:21,070
Great place.
There's a lot of great restaurants 

2923
02:02:21,070 --> 02:02:23,441
there.
It's just a great international melting 

2924
02:02:23,441 --> 02:02:23,441
pot,
like a legit melting pot.

2925
02:02:23,441 --> 02:02:26,570
And it's really funny for me as a troll 
because they're all passive aggressive.

2926
02:02:26,571 --> 02:02:31,571
Right?
So you can poke their buttons and get 

2927
02:02:31,571 --> 02:02:31,571
them to lose their shit.
Uh,

2928
02:02:31,571 --> 02:02:31,571
it's,
it's hard to do,

2929
02:02:31,571 --> 02:02:32,750
but when you get the canadians freaking 
out,

2930
02:02:32,751 --> 02:02:34,940
it's really fun.
You're one of the rare,

2931
02:02:35,090 --> 02:02:36,890
happy,
intelligent,

2932
02:02:36,920 --> 02:02:41,920
well educated,
successful people who also considers 

2933
02:02:41,920 --> 02:02:42,530
themselves a troll.
yeah.

2934
02:02:42,620 --> 02:02:44,270
Yeah.
I guess that's pretty rare.

2935
02:02:44,330 --> 02:02:49,330
Yeah,
because you do it with a smile on your 

2936
02:02:49,330 --> 02:02:50,000
face.
And in my heart is a genuine playfulness

2937
02:02:50,001 --> 02:02:50,780
to it.
Yes.

2938
02:02:50,930 --> 02:02:51,490
Right.
We're,

2939
02:02:51,510 --> 02:02:54,740
whereas a lot of people,
if there's a bitterness and resentment,

2940
02:02:55,250 --> 02:02:58,940
if someone doesn't agree with me or I 
don't agree with them or if I don't like

2941
02:02:59,610 --> 02:03:02,270
their music or their tv,
I wish them well.

2942
02:03:02,330 --> 02:03:07,330
I wish their family will just because we
can't be friends as it means something 

2943
02:03:07,330 --> 02:03:10,061
bad should happen to you.
And most people can wrap their heads 

2944
02:03:10,061 --> 02:03:12,461
around that.
Like if they think you're a different 

2945
02:03:12,461 --> 02:03:12,461
political person for me,
I want you to die.

2946
02:03:12,461 --> 02:03:12,461
It's like,
no,

2947
02:03:12,461 --> 02:03:17,080
I want you to be.
Well just we don't have to be friends 

2948
02:03:17,080 --> 02:03:17,080
and that's okay.
So it's fun fucking with people.

2949
02:03:17,080 --> 02:03:21,010
Well my favorite one was talking about 
how trump wants to build a wall in the 

2950
02:03:21,010 --> 02:03:22,820
south.
Hitler built the berlin wall,

2951
02:03:22,880 --> 02:03:25,410
wake up people and don't like hitler did
and while I'm like,

2952
02:03:25,610 --> 02:03:27,200
well,
he wrote about it in my comp.

2953
02:03:27,210 --> 02:03:29,420
They had the blueprints in it and they 
start arguing for days.

2954
02:03:29,421 --> 02:03:30,860
They'll argue with me.
It's amazing.

2955
02:03:31,100 --> 02:03:36,100
We'll some arguments do go on for days.
I follow a few arguments that I'm not 

2956
02:03:36,100 --> 02:03:38,480
involved in and I'll just go and dip my 
toe and I'm like,

2957
02:03:38,710 --> 02:03:41,750
you guys are still going to add like 
christ,

2958
02:03:41,870 --> 02:03:43,360
don't you have shit to do?
Yeah,

2959
02:03:43,400 --> 02:03:48,400
it's fun trolling people until we also 
take into account the sheer amount of 

2960
02:03:48,400 --> 02:03:51,180
time and constructing these zingers and 
these,

2961
02:03:51,181 --> 02:03:56,181
these paragraphs and then then googling 
the facts and then posting relevant 

2962
02:03:56,181 --> 02:03:58,850
studies and the fact that people just,
they'll,

2963
02:03:58,880 --> 02:04:00,350
they'll obsess on it.
You know,

2964
02:04:00,351 --> 02:04:05,351
they're not just obsessing about it when
they're sitting right there probably at 

2965
02:04:05,351 --> 02:04:08,891
restaurants talking to their spouse,
just twisting it up in their head and 

2966
02:04:08,891 --> 02:04:10,700
trying to figure out a way to win.
I don't argue with people really.

2967
02:04:10,700 --> 02:04:12,260
so if they come at me and they asked me,
well,

2968
02:04:12,290 --> 02:04:13,480
how about when you think about this?
I just go,

2969
02:04:13,481 --> 02:04:15,500
am I being detained?
Like that's all I say,

2970
02:04:15,501 --> 02:04:17,280
and then that's it.
I'll just say nah.

2971
02:04:17,590 --> 02:04:18,980
And that's it.
Why?

2972
02:04:20,050 --> 02:04:21,260
Yeah,
but you like to fuck with them?

2973
02:04:21,261 --> 02:04:23,330
I do like to fuck with them.
Why do you like to fuck with them?

2974
02:04:23,760 --> 02:04:28,760
Is it because they're non player 
characters and you want to wind them up 

2975
02:04:28,760 --> 02:04:31,241
and have bouncing off the walls in a 
liquor store that you don't have to 

2976
02:04:31,241 --> 02:04:31,241
visit it anymore?
That that's part of it.

2977
02:04:31,241 --> 02:04:32,780
That could be part of it.
I think it's just,

2978
02:04:32,820 --> 02:04:34,370
it's it,
it makes me.

2979
02:04:34,371 --> 02:04:38,100
It's funny to me how life is a great fun

2980
02:04:38,100 --> 02:04:40,650
adventure or you've worn many hats in 
your life,

2981
02:04:40,651 --> 02:04:41,460
so vi,
right?

2982
02:04:41,490 --> 02:04:46,490
And you never know what's gonna happen 
next and if you have the sense of 

2983
02:04:46,490 --> 02:04:49,491
appreciation and joy for it,
I think that's the best and right 

2984
02:04:49,491 --> 02:04:49,491
attitude.
If you take everything.

2985
02:04:49,491 --> 02:04:50,470
So some,
some,

2986
02:04:50,640 --> 02:04:53,580
some blue checked asshole speaking 
myself on twitter is wrong.

2987
02:04:53,850 --> 02:04:55,440
how does that affect you?
Fine,

2988
02:04:55,441 --> 02:04:57,030
I'm an asshole.
What do you care?

2989
02:04:57,210 --> 02:05:00,690
So it's very funny to me how easily 
people flip their shit.

2990
02:05:00,900 --> 02:05:05,900
And this is the one how people who are 
marginally intelligent think they're 

2991
02:05:05,900 --> 02:05:08,370
brilliant and how quick they are to 
assume everyone around them is a moron.

2992
02:05:09,090 --> 02:05:11,970
Everyone is ignorant of 99 percent of 
human knowledge.

2993
02:05:12,330 --> 02:05:17,330
And just because someone smarter than 
you doesn't mean they're going to be 

2994
02:05:17,330 --> 02:05:19,461
writing an argument.
They might not have access to data you 

2995
02:05:19,461 --> 02:05:19,461
have or they might not just not see 
something,

2996
02:05:19,461 --> 02:05:21,930
but people who are marginally 
intelligent think they know it all.

2997
02:05:21,930 --> 02:05:22,260
It's like,
no,

2998
02:05:22,261 --> 02:05:22,980
you don't,
you know,

2999
02:05:23,100 --> 02:05:24,000
almost nothing.
And as,

3000
02:05:24,040 --> 02:05:25,690
as do all of us.
Yes,

3001
02:05:25,740 --> 02:05:30,740
that's a really good point.
Most people know almost nothing about 

3002
02:05:30,740 --> 02:05:30,740
everything.
correct.

3003
02:05:30,870 --> 02:05:35,870
And that's okay.
Doesn't make them bad people if you 

3004
02:05:35,870 --> 02:05:35,870
don't know how to spell that.
Okay.

3005
02:05:35,870 --> 02:05:39,890
That's such a great point because lack 
of information does not mean lack of 

3006
02:05:39,890 --> 02:05:40,140
intelligence.
Right?

3007
02:05:40,141 --> 02:05:40,740
And,
and,

3008
02:05:40,770 --> 02:05:44,100
but also presence of intelligence 
doesn't mean presence of information.

3009
02:05:44,560 --> 02:05:49,560
Right?
Or presence of information doesn't mean 

3010
02:05:49,560 --> 02:05:49,560
the presence of intel.
Correct.

3011
02:05:49,560 --> 02:05:49,560
Yeah.
Yeah.

3012
02:05:49,560 --> 02:05:51,780
That's.
This is why my show is misspelled.

3013
02:05:51,781 --> 02:05:55,050
It's called your welcome while you are.
And people correct me,

3014
02:05:55,230 --> 02:06:00,230
but they're actually wrong because the 
first thing I say is I'm michael malice 

3015
02:06:00,230 --> 02:06:01,830
and let this be your welcome.
So they're wrong on every level,

3016
02:06:01,831 --> 02:06:04,470
but they still got to jump in.
Kennedy just re tweeted it out.

3017
02:06:04,471 --> 02:06:05,220
You're welcome.
You know?

3018
02:06:05,220 --> 02:06:06,750
And then if people are correcting her,
I'm like,

3019
02:06:06,930 --> 02:06:09,870
don't you think maybe an author and 
brooklyn spelling bee champion.

3020
02:06:09,871 --> 02:06:11,560
Thank you very much.
Yes,

3021
02:06:11,561 --> 02:06:13,950
I in brooklyn.
I've the jacket if fits now.

3022
02:06:14,800 --> 02:06:16,560
Don't you think?
Maybe I know the difference in your,

3023
02:06:16,561 --> 02:06:19,290
in your maybe what year were you?
What year was this?

3024
02:06:19,300 --> 02:06:22,620
80 five.
And you were brooklyn and we know.

3025
02:06:22,650 --> 02:06:24,680
How old were you?
A nine.

3026
02:06:24,830 --> 02:06:26,550
The,
the jacket still fits.

3027
02:06:26,580 --> 02:06:27,930
It fits now.
It didn't fit then.

3028
02:06:28,910 --> 02:06:29,670
Oh,
it was too big.

3029
02:06:29,700 --> 02:06:30,420
Yeah.
Oh,

3030
02:06:30,421 --> 02:06:31,120
okay.
I see.

3031
02:06:31,270 --> 02:06:33,710
I grew a little bit.
So they gave you a jacket.

3032
02:06:33,711 --> 02:06:37,230
They get a jacket and athletic stating 
that you would fit into it eventually?

3033
02:06:37,231 --> 02:06:42,231
No,
everyone gets the same size jacket 

3034
02:06:42,231 --> 02:06:42,231
because it's from like age or maybe it 
was 10.

3035
02:06:42,231 --> 02:06:42,630
It was fifth grade.
So it's like 10 to 14.

3036
02:06:42,960 --> 02:06:44,460
One size fits all the daily news.

3037
02:06:44,490 --> 02:06:46,710
So if you were a football player or if 
you were a nerd,

3038
02:06:46,740 --> 02:06:48,450
there's no skillful players in the 
spelling bee.

3039
02:06:48,451 --> 02:06:50,130
I should not one.
Not one.

3040
02:06:50,980 --> 02:06:53,550
So that approaches on your part against 
football?

3041
02:06:53,630 --> 02:06:54,030
No,
I just,

3042
02:06:54,220 --> 02:06:59,220
I was there and none of them were.
I'm sure there were no shoulders to be 

3043
02:06:59,220 --> 02:06:59,430
had.
No,

3044
02:06:59,440 --> 02:07:03,060
no,
no brush shoulders at the madison square

3045
02:07:03,061 --> 02:07:05,460
garden in 1986 or something like that.
Yeah.

3046
02:07:05,490 --> 02:07:07,230
Wow.
You were in madison square garden?

3047
02:07:07,231 --> 02:07:07,640
Yeah,
that's right.

3048
02:07:07,641 --> 02:07:09,300
It was.
Wow.

3049
02:07:09,690 --> 02:07:13,290
Not really.
I mean it was like a small part I guess.

3050
02:07:13,291 --> 02:07:13,900
Yeah,
it,

3051
02:07:14,060 --> 02:07:19,060
you know,
there's like the big part of madison 

3052
02:07:19,060 --> 02:07:19,060
square garden.
This is the smallest theater.

3053
02:07:19,060 --> 02:07:19,060
Yeah.
So there's a smaller one.

3054
02:07:19,860 --> 02:07:22,050
It was more than one theater in madison 
square garden.

3055
02:07:22,150 --> 02:07:27,150
It was a tiny one because we did our,
we did a theater really small recently 

3056
02:07:27,211 --> 02:07:32,211
where there was a ufc press conference 
and then a way in and that was not that 

3057
02:07:32,211 --> 02:07:32,211
big.
That was with that.

3058
02:07:32,211 --> 02:07:33,270
Was that,
was that with matt hughes?

3059
02:07:33,840 --> 02:07:34,950
No,
no.

3060
02:07:34,960 --> 02:07:35,800
That was a different one.

3061
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:40,450
That was just last weekend and that was 
a tiny one.

3062
02:07:41,080 --> 02:07:46,080
I want to say it looked like it was no 
more than maybe a thousand,

3063
02:07:46,450 --> 02:07:48,400
1500 people.
It seems small,

3064
02:07:48,560 --> 02:07:50,290
you know,
it seems like a small little.

3065
02:07:50,770 --> 02:07:52,800
Maybe it's called the hulu.
Okay.

3066
02:07:52,930 --> 02:07:55,890
How many seats does that bad boy?
I want to say 2000.

3067
02:07:56,730 --> 02:08:01,600
I'm going to go with 2000 because I've 
done the other one which is 6,000

3068
02:08:02,800 --> 02:08:04,300
5,500.
Is it really?

3069
02:08:04,810 --> 02:08:06,040
Wow.
That's a joke.

3070
02:08:06,280 --> 02:08:08,740
That's crazy.
So there's more than one theater though,

3071
02:08:09,580 --> 02:08:14,580
but there's the big theater and then 
there's more than one little theater or 

3072
02:08:14,580 --> 02:08:15,730
am I wrong?
Think so,

3073
02:08:15,731 --> 02:08:20,731
but the little one that you're talking 
about doesn't really come up because 

3074
02:08:20,731 --> 02:08:22,060
there's not tons of events at it that 
like write tickets all the time.

3075
02:08:22,180 --> 02:08:23,770
Man.
It dIdn't look like 5,500

3076
02:08:23,771 --> 02:08:25,420
people.
it looked way smaller than that.

3077
02:08:25,860 --> 02:08:26,760
I don't know.
I could be wrong,

3078
02:08:28,210 --> 02:08:29,740
but still.
That's pretty dope.

3079
02:08:30,010 --> 02:08:34,750
When fucking spelling bee champion,
did you stick it in everybody's face for

3080
02:08:34,770 --> 02:08:38,740
a couple of weeks afterwards?
They might have had a day in my honor at

3081
02:08:38,760 --> 02:08:40,110
my elementary school.
Wow.

3082
02:08:40,260 --> 02:08:42,730
Because that was the first one to ever 
do that day in your honor.

3083
02:08:42,920 --> 02:08:45,910
The chicks look at you differently.
Do you remember this?

3084
02:08:45,960 --> 02:08:46,810
Uh,
no.

3085
02:08:46,900 --> 02:08:49,090
What's your recollection have any effect
at all?

3086
02:08:49,091 --> 02:08:50,770
It was still tough.
Total disdain?

3087
02:08:54,340 --> 02:08:56,800
Yeah.
Does it help being on fox news?

3088
02:08:56,980 --> 02:08:58,630
The chicks look at you differently 
because of that.

3089
02:08:58,660 --> 02:09:01,060
Not in a good way.
Here's the,

3090
02:09:01,180 --> 02:09:06,180
here's the problem.
When you're on tv and doing panels and 

3091
02:09:06,180 --> 02:09:09,340
things like that,
you're talking to women who are not only

3092
02:09:09,370 --> 02:09:14,370
beautiful,
they're also extremely well spoken and 

3093
02:09:14,370 --> 02:09:16,570
great conversationalists.
The percent of human beings who are good

3094
02:09:16,571 --> 02:09:21,571
conversationalist is like one percent,
so it's very hard to date because it's 

3095
02:09:22,481 --> 02:09:24,580
like,
I don't care about sheila in your office

3096
02:09:24,581 --> 02:09:27,400
and how she's giving you headaches so it
fucks you up.

3097
02:09:27,670 --> 02:09:30,310
And it's also hard to meet people 
because you know,

3098
02:09:30,850 --> 02:09:35,850
you meet people in green rooms,
but it's hard for me to meet people day 

3099
02:09:35,850 --> 02:09:35,850
to day.
Yeah,

3100
02:09:35,850 --> 02:09:40,110
it's tough.
It's hard out there for a pimp saying,

3101
02:09:40,570 --> 02:09:45,570
let 10 had strong joe.
It's going to be hard for those gals 

3102
02:09:45,570 --> 02:09:45,570
too,
right?

3103
02:09:45,570 --> 02:09:45,570
Yeah.

3104
02:09:45,570 --> 02:09:46,660
well no,
they could probably take the wall street

3105
02:09:46,661 --> 02:09:47,920
guys.
Yeah,

3106
02:09:47,921 --> 02:09:50,980
but do they want to.
I mean if you're a super smart,

3107
02:09:51,010 --> 02:09:54,700
really articulate woman who's also has a
career of her own and then you've got to

3108
02:09:54,701 --> 02:09:58,390
pretend you're dumber than this dude,
cause you got to be smart and funny,

3109
02:09:58,391 --> 02:10:00,940
but you can't threaten his male ego.
No,

3110
02:10:02,660 --> 02:10:04,480
I'm impressed with so many of those 
women.

3111
02:10:04,540 --> 02:10:09,540
I mean because they got to look amazing 
and they're also funny and quick on 

3112
02:10:09,540 --> 02:10:13,141
their feet and in informed the,
they've got the whole fucking that I 

3113
02:10:13,141 --> 02:10:15,901
have to ignore that breeze going in 
between their legs because he's not 

3114
02:10:15,901 --> 02:10:15,990
wearing any pants.
I've,

3115
02:10:16,080 --> 02:10:21,080
I've got to sit in a lecture once.
it was one of the great bucket list 

3116
02:10:21,080 --> 02:10:21,080
moments of my life.
Yeah,

3117
02:10:21,080 --> 02:10:22,050
the lecture.
Yeah,

3118
02:10:22,270 --> 02:10:23,170
yeah,
yeah.

3119
02:10:23,171 --> 02:10:26,260
My quads are important.
So fox news switched the fucking game,

3120
02:10:26,261 --> 02:10:28,070
didn't it when it comes to that?
Yeah.

3121
02:10:28,180 --> 02:10:33,180
They can wear pants now.
Well it's not just that I'm saying that 

3122
02:10:33,180 --> 02:10:34,460
having really hot women talk about 
policy

3123
02:10:34,850 --> 02:10:35,240
talk about.

3124
02:10:35,960 --> 02:10:40,960
Well yeah,
that was roger's innovation and that's 

3125
02:10:40,960 --> 02:10:43,731
the big mistake.
I think they get a bad rap because it's 

3126
02:10:43,731 --> 02:10:43,731
like,
oh,

3127
02:10:43,731 --> 02:10:43,860
they're just a bump,
like bubble heads.

3128
02:10:44,100 --> 02:10:47,840
These women are very smart.
Don't curse the haglins.

3129
02:10:47,850 --> 02:10:48,270
She,
uh,

3130
02:10:48,300 --> 02:10:50,670
she was mIss America.
She was on a lot of shows with me.

3131
02:10:51,180 --> 02:10:53,760
You win miss America because of also 
being able to speak well.

3132
02:10:53,761 --> 02:10:55,310
It's not just how you look in a bathing 
suit.

3133
02:10:55,320 --> 02:10:57,600
These women are all type a 
overachievers.

3134
02:10:58,710 --> 02:11:01,560
They're still having miss american now,
but now they don't wear bathing suits.

3135
02:11:01,561 --> 02:11:02,730
Right?
Oh god.

3136
02:11:02,731 --> 02:11:04,050
This is one of the jokes that got 
caught.

3137
02:11:04,051 --> 02:11:05,790
Can I tell this joke?
I just told her yesterday,

3138
02:11:05,820 --> 02:11:10,820
lucky scent.
I was on kennedy show and they were 

3139
02:11:10,820 --> 02:11:11,250
cutting the bathing suit from miss teen 
usa.

3140
02:11:11,940 --> 02:11:16,940
And I said,
can you ask the producers if it's okay 

3141
02:11:16,940 --> 02:11:18,120
for me to say jonbenet ramsey spinning 
in her grave?

3142
02:11:19,830 --> 02:11:20,690
And candy goes?

3143
02:11:20,800 --> 02:11:21,670
No,
like,

3144
02:11:22,230 --> 02:11:23,200
like,
no.

3145
02:11:23,201 --> 02:11:25,990
So I couldn't say that joke.
That's a rough one.

3146
02:11:25,991 --> 02:11:27,790
That's a good one.
Good one.

3147
02:11:27,820 --> 02:11:30,430
That's a good one.
I was in dallas once and uh,

3148
02:11:30,490 --> 02:11:34,340
me and joey diaz and duncan were there 
for a standup and uh,

3149
02:11:34,350 --> 02:11:39,350
we were staying at this hotel and in the
hotel they were having a little kid 

3150
02:11:39,350 --> 02:11:43,860
beauty contest and it was fucking twist.
I'm talking like five,

3151
02:11:45,700 --> 02:11:49,720
six year old girls wearing high heels,
paint makeup,

3152
02:11:49,780 --> 02:11:50,740
full horror paint.
Yeah.

3153
02:11:50,770 --> 02:11:54,220
Full warpaint.
They look like drag queens.

3154
02:11:54,460 --> 02:11:56,710
It was so,
but it was just strange.

3155
02:11:57,280 --> 02:12:00,310
It was like they were impersonating 
grown women.

3156
02:12:00,380 --> 02:12:04,240
Right.
And there's a and very sexualized.

3157
02:12:04,300 --> 02:12:06,520
Right.
It's so creepy to see them.

3158
02:12:06,610 --> 02:12:11,610
Little tiny girls were little tiny feet 
trying to walk around and stiletto 

3159
02:12:11,610 --> 02:12:11,610
heels.
Right.

3160
02:12:11,610 --> 02:12:12,930
And bras and skirt.
Yeah,

3161
02:12:12,931 --> 02:12:13,450
yeah,
yeah,

3162
02:12:14,370 --> 02:12:14,920
yeah.
It's,

3163
02:12:14,930 --> 02:12:17,890
it's,
it's very weird fucking twisted man.

3164
02:12:17,920 --> 02:12:19,270
Yes.
It's twisted.

3165
02:12:19,271 --> 02:12:24,271
Is it,
do they look even more fucked up in 

3166
02:12:24,271 --> 02:12:24,271
person?
Yeah.

3167
02:12:24,271 --> 02:12:24,271
Then on tv.
Yeah.

3168
02:12:24,271 --> 02:12:27,160
I'd never seen it in person before.
And then to be around them like you feel

3169
02:12:27,161 --> 02:12:30,790
scared or.
you know what I mean?

3170
02:12:30,791 --> 02:12:32,890
It's like I don't,
I've never seen this in real life.

3171
02:12:32,920 --> 02:12:34,210
Oh,
it's fucking strange.

3172
02:12:34,211 --> 02:12:37,510
We were passing by this ballroom where 
it was going on,

3173
02:12:37,511 --> 02:12:40,690
so they were all milling out into the 
hallways and we were walking through and

3174
02:12:40,691 --> 02:12:44,140
I was like,
this is fucking strange.

3175
02:12:44,320 --> 02:12:49,320
There was so many of them and you know,
and it's like these fat mom's that look 

3176
02:12:49,320 --> 02:12:53,200
like a mama june.
That's what they look like.

3177
02:12:53,230 --> 02:12:58,230
They all look like that and they're all 
look strange and they have too much 

3178
02:12:58,230 --> 02:13:01,771
lipstick on and you know,
and they're wearing weird clothes 

3179
02:13:01,771 --> 02:13:03,220
themselves and they got their little 
kids dressed up like grown women.

3180
02:13:03,221 --> 02:13:04,270
It's like,
whoa.

3181
02:13:04,440 --> 02:13:04,820
Yeah,
it's,

3182
02:13:04,821 --> 02:13:05,820
it's,
it's upsetting.

3183
02:13:05,850 --> 02:13:10,850
And they're also the.
And the thing is even if they're not 

3184
02:13:10,850 --> 02:13:13,011
wearing the makeup,
it's still extremely competitive and 

3185
02:13:13,011 --> 02:13:13,011
you're fucking with the kids' emotions.

3186
02:13:13,011 --> 02:13:13,011
Yes.
Yeah.

3187
02:13:13,011 --> 02:13:17,770
And it's competitive in a way that 
you're basically just judging them on 

3188
02:13:17,770 --> 02:13:21,050
their physical presence and maybe some 
fucking shitty singing they're doing.

3189
02:13:21,560 --> 02:13:22,170
Yeah,
it's,

3190
02:13:22,171 --> 02:13:22,910
it's,
it's.

3191
02:13:22,960 --> 02:13:23,630
And for what,

3192
02:13:25,020 --> 02:13:27,030
what did the tap dance or something,
what do they do?

3193
02:13:27,490 --> 02:13:30,270
Tend to do things like that,
like this kind of stuff,

3194
02:13:30,300 --> 02:13:32,070
but that's even more a tween I think

3195
02:13:32,100 --> 02:13:33,810
at that bad grandpa.
Oh,

3196
02:13:33,811 --> 02:13:35,160
this is real bad grandpa.
Oh,

3197
02:13:35,161 --> 02:13:38,160
that was hilarious.
And this.

3198
02:13:38,161 --> 02:13:42,550
But these are real.
A real content is a real contest there.

3199
02:13:42,570 --> 02:13:47,570
Bud out and turn this off and at that 
frosted hair.

3200
02:13:47,750 --> 02:13:50,130
good lord.
It's best highlights from mom.

3201
02:13:50,760 --> 02:13:55,760
Yeah.
That's one of those weird traditions 

3202
02:13:55,760 --> 02:13:55,760
where people are going to look back in 
the future and they'll go,

3203
02:13:55,760 --> 02:13:56,730
what the fuck were people thinking?
Do you know?

3204
02:13:56,910 --> 02:13:58,470
When I had her on my show,
miss America,

3205
02:13:58,471 --> 02:14:00,390
I asked her a quiz that miss America 
questions.

3206
02:14:00,420 --> 02:14:05,420
There used to be a rule that I think is 
rule like 14 or before miss America had 

3207
02:14:05,420 --> 02:14:08,110
to be of the white race.
Whoa.

3208
02:14:08,180 --> 02:14:10,740
Yeah.
Until not that long ago.

3209
02:14:11,310 --> 02:14:13,140
Really?
And they have to approve it.

3210
02:14:13,530 --> 02:14:15,860
I think the fifties or sixties.
It was.

3211
02:14:15,900 --> 02:14:17,190
It wasn't like the twenties.
No,

3212
02:14:17,191 --> 02:14:17,470
no,
no.

3213
02:14:17,490 --> 02:14:17,850
Yeah.

3214
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:25,000
And there was drama with bess myerson.
Who's the first and only today jewish 

3215
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:25,800
miss America.
What was the drama like?

3216
02:14:25,801 --> 02:14:28,310
She's jewish.
I think they asked her to change her.

3217
02:14:28,410 --> 02:14:31,590
They asked her to change her name.
Oh yeah.

3218
02:14:32,070 --> 02:14:34,780
This was what?
Something maybe smith something.

3219
02:14:35,390 --> 02:14:36,030
Yeah,
something.

3220
02:14:36,031 --> 02:14:37,950
A little less ethnic.
Something white.

3221
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,530
Yeah,
what year was that?

3222
02:14:40,560 --> 02:14:45,560
I mean I think she's the forties where I
looked up sheryl brown in 1970 was the 

3223
02:14:47,281 --> 02:14:52,281
first black miss America after they 
abolished the rule that rule number 

3224
02:14:52,281 --> 02:14:53,220
seven that was instituted during the 19 
thirties.

3225
02:14:53,221 --> 02:14:56,310
That contestants must be of good health 
and the lack of white race.

3226
02:14:56,400 --> 02:15:01,020
Her name's brown too,
but you can't change that name.

3227
02:15:01,050 --> 02:15:02,400
I mean,
that's her name,

3228
02:15:02,590 --> 02:15:06,630
which she is the whole package.
There she is.

3229
02:15:06,631 --> 02:15:09,270
Miss America is this,
uh,

3230
02:15:09,271 --> 02:15:10,620
this time.
I mean,

3231
02:15:10,720 --> 02:15:12,480
I know you enjoyed chaos.
Oh,

3232
02:15:12,490 --> 02:15:12,950
I love it.

3233
02:15:12,950 --> 02:15:17,950
And you enjoy.
You enjoy watching ships and fools 

3234
02:15:17,950 --> 02:15:18,600
crashed into rocks.
Oh yes.

3235
02:15:18,640 --> 02:15:20,040
You really do.
Well,

3236
02:15:21,120 --> 02:15:24,330
is this time fruitful for you?
Oh my god.

3237
02:15:24,380 --> 02:15:27,460
Is this,
it gets better and better everyday.

3238
02:15:27,510 --> 02:15:30,420
I wake up and I feel like I'm in the 
smurf village or something.

3239
02:15:30,421 --> 02:15:35,421
I'm so happy all the time.
But do you have any concerns that this 

3240
02:15:35,421 --> 02:15:39,081
is going to go horribly wrong and we're 
going to wind up in a nuclear war with 

3241
02:15:39,081 --> 02:15:39,180
Russia or nothing?
No,

3242
02:15:39,181 --> 02:15:39,470
no,
no.

3243
02:15:39,480 --> 02:15:39,990
I mean,
there were,

3244
02:15:40,010 --> 02:15:45,010
there are many times when we could have 
been a nuclear war with Russia during 

3245
02:15:45,010 --> 02:15:47,481
the cold war and they were actually 
stopped there at these great stories 

3246
02:15:47,481 --> 02:15:47,481
about that,
like the submarine and the,

3247
02:15:47,481 --> 02:15:48,900
of course,
the cuban missile crisis.

3248
02:15:49,130 --> 02:15:54,130
Uh,
I have no concern actually both reagan 

3249
02:15:54,130 --> 02:15:56,511
and gorbachev,
this is a great story of history 

3250
02:15:56,511 --> 02:15:57,850
independently were taken to the bunker 
and walk through and both of them refuse

3251
02:15:57,851 --> 02:15:58,590
to press the button.

3252
02:15:58,620 --> 02:16:00,570
Even as simulation.
They both said,

3253
02:16:00,690 --> 02:16:01,940
if we get nuked,
we get nuked.

3254
02:16:01,941 --> 02:16:03,930
I'm not fucking retaliating killing 
millions of people.

3255
02:16:04,200 --> 02:16:06,550
So I think this idea,
remember the,

3256
02:16:06,600 --> 02:16:08,940
the idea that trump has his finger on 
the nuclear button,

3257
02:16:09,150 --> 02:16:10,590
he's going to be nuking people all the 
time.

3258
02:16:10,591 --> 02:16:14,100
It's like he's never gotten a fistfight.
So it's going to be,

3259
02:16:14,150 --> 02:16:15,490
you know,
it takes a lot to nukes,

3260
02:16:15,530 --> 02:16:20,530
you know what I mean?
The only countries ever knew anyone was 

3261
02:16:20,530 --> 02:16:20,530
us.
Let's remember that.

3262
02:16:20,530 --> 02:16:22,380
Do you remember him threatening joe 
barden sort of job on him?

3263
02:16:22,381 --> 02:16:23,280
Yeah.
And then he said,

3264
02:16:23,370 --> 02:16:24,810
I would knock you out,
joe biden,

3265
02:16:24,811 --> 02:16:28,380
joe biden would go down fast and hard.
So he said,

3266
02:16:29,370 --> 02:16:34,370
I talked about in the beginning of my 
netflix specials because it was so 

3267
02:16:34,370 --> 02:16:34,370
ridiculous.
I was like,

3268
02:16:34,370 --> 02:16:35,620
I want to get in his ear,
try to make this happen.

3269
02:16:36,160 --> 02:16:37,330
like you're great at everything.

3270
02:16:37,360 --> 02:16:39,340
You'd be great at fighting.
Yeah.

3271
02:16:39,420 --> 02:16:39,970
Do it.
Do it,

3272
02:16:40,130 --> 02:16:42,260
do it.
They'll let it talk to you.

3273
02:16:42,540 --> 02:16:46,300
Making fun of your kids to old men like 
trump and biden.

3274
02:16:46,301 --> 02:16:50,650
Fight to the death.
It would be amazing.

3275
02:16:50,800 --> 02:16:55,800
It would be amazing.
It would probably be the biggest paper 

3276
02:16:55,800 --> 02:16:55,800
view event in the history of the world 
have been.

3277
02:16:55,800 --> 02:16:56,270
Well,
what?

3278
02:16:56,300 --> 02:16:57,800
What's currently the biggest pay per 
view?

3279
02:16:58,360 --> 02:17:01,840
Many pack yow.
A floyd mayweather.

3280
02:17:01,890 --> 02:17:04,360
The first fight.
This would clearly when.

3281
02:17:04,800 --> 02:17:05,390
Yeah.
oh,

3282
02:17:05,410 --> 02:17:07,490
I saw these old guys go at it.
Yeah.

3283
02:17:08,800 --> 02:17:10,720
They're so old too.
It's like back in Russia,

3284
02:17:10,780 --> 02:17:12,490
lane motherland.
Look,

3285
02:17:12,491 --> 02:17:15,560
get these guys exist in Russia.
That grandpa's in it.

3286
02:17:15,880 --> 02:17:17,460
This was a real real fight.
Yeah.

3287
02:17:18,970 --> 02:17:23,970
There's a lot of that in Russia fell 
when he hit him and then the other guys 

3288
02:17:23,970 --> 02:17:23,970
like,
bitch,

3289
02:17:23,970 --> 02:17:25,090
I got you.
And then he falls.

3290
02:17:25,240 --> 02:17:27,130
That's how ruth bader ginsburg broke her
ribs.

3291
02:17:27,160 --> 02:17:28,320
They don't talk about that.
Yeah,

3292
02:17:28,350 --> 02:17:32,630
she fought with some other bitch.
Tried to pull a knife on her.

3293
02:17:32,660 --> 02:17:37,660
Oh,
you have to do is have good movement 

3294
02:17:37,660 --> 02:17:38,080
because it's got a good job,
but he's got no balance.

3295
02:17:38,620 --> 02:17:39,730
Hips are bad too.
Oh,

3296
02:17:39,731 --> 02:17:41,490
leg kick.
Like synchronized.

3297
02:17:41,510 --> 02:17:42,820
No,
like modern dance.

3298
02:17:42,821 --> 02:17:45,700
this is real old dudes.
Guys got no shoes on too.

3299
02:17:46,270 --> 02:17:51,270
That's probably why he's doing better.
The guy with no shoes does grounded 

3300
02:17:51,270 --> 02:17:54,430
better calling this fight like you have 
got the vest.

3301
02:17:54,670 --> 02:17:57,010
He's thinking about sucker punched him 
with the right.

3302
02:17:57,011 --> 02:17:57,900
See?
See,

3303
02:17:58,060 --> 02:18:00,250
I saw that comment.
See I saw that right?

3304
02:18:02,030 --> 02:18:04,720
Karate chop.
Karate chop during the face.

3305
02:18:05,460 --> 02:18:08,260
But you could see the guy tightening up 
with that right side.

3306
02:18:08,350 --> 02:18:13,350
You got to be real careful when you see 
a guy moving funny with that car looked 

3307
02:18:13,350 --> 02:18:13,720
like it was a key.
I think it said.

3308
02:18:14,410 --> 02:18:18,340
Do you know where this is?
man just had like a european man statue.

3309
02:18:18,950 --> 02:18:21,730
This has got to be some european 
country.

3310
02:18:22,260 --> 02:18:24,310
Mm.
There's a twitter account,

3311
02:18:24,311 --> 02:18:26,950
like something only in Russia and it's 
just rushing shit.

3312
02:18:26,951 --> 02:18:27,580
I look at it,
I'm like,

3313
02:18:27,581 --> 02:18:28,780
fuck,
this is my jeans.

3314
02:18:29,140 --> 02:18:30,550
Yeah,
you got crazy jeans,

3315
02:18:30,551 --> 02:18:31,270
man.
I'm rushing.

3316
02:18:31,271 --> 02:18:34,630
People have done some wild shit.
It's like dan soders joke about russians

3317
02:18:34,631 --> 02:18:37,420
are the scariest white people.
It's say he,

3318
02:18:37,421 --> 02:18:38,770
that's his job.
He has this whole bit.

3319
02:18:38,771 --> 02:18:39,460
He goes,
uh,

3320
02:18:39,670 --> 02:18:40,720
I,
I moved to bed.

3321
02:18:40,721 --> 02:18:43,030
I'm going to butcher it because I'm not 
a comedian like dan.

3322
02:18:43,031 --> 02:18:43,780
But he goes,
you know,

3323
02:18:43,781 --> 02:18:46,390
I moved to this neighborhood and I 
figured out what to do.

3324
02:18:46,660 --> 02:18:47,620
He goes,
someone came up to me.

3325
02:18:47,621 --> 02:18:47,920
He's like,
yeah,

3326
02:18:47,930 --> 02:18:48,880
motherfucker,
what the fuck you doing?

3327
02:18:48,881 --> 02:18:50,680
He goes,
you think this is about neighborhood?

3328
02:18:50,920 --> 02:18:55,920
And he goes,
I just put on her russian accent and 

3329
02:18:55,920 --> 02:18:55,920
really scattered rays like russians are 
the scariest white people.

3330
02:18:56,090 --> 02:18:59,080
They're definitely not regular white 
people and the women are the worst.

3331
02:18:59,220 --> 02:19:04,220
Are they russian winning?
Then we'll fucking cut you and laugh at 

3332
02:19:04,220 --> 02:19:04,220
your bleeding.
Whoa.

3333
02:19:04,220 --> 02:19:05,590
They're merciless.
My mom,

3334
02:19:05,591 --> 02:19:10,591
my grandma,
they would do enough fuck around deaf 

3335
02:19:10,591 --> 02:19:10,591
from the old country.
What about Russia?

3336
02:19:10,591 --> 02:19:12,010
Woman that you encountered today?
They're worse because they're liberated.

3337
02:19:12,011 --> 02:19:12,880
So they're,
they're,

3338
02:19:12,910 --> 02:19:15,790
they're ruthless.
They're very hot.

3339
02:19:15,791 --> 02:19:17,050
Crazy in the head.
Crazy in the bed.

3340
02:19:17,051 --> 02:19:18,470
Yeah.
But I,

3341
02:19:18,490 --> 02:19:20,650
I can't do it.
I can't do it.

3342
02:19:20,710 --> 02:19:25,710
Well,
that band that the documentary was the 

3343
02:19:25,710 --> 02:19:26,950
pussy riot.
Those bitches are loped.

3344
02:19:27,070 --> 02:19:28,160
I got to put free pussy

3345
02:19:28,160 --> 02:19:30,860
riot tee shirt.
I don't even know what they did wrong,

3346
02:19:30,861 --> 02:19:32,900
but some wearing that shirt.
Yeah.

3347
02:19:33,280 --> 02:19:36,590
Well that's,
it's ballsy to criticize putin.

3348
02:19:37,070 --> 02:19:37,730
Oh yeah.
Yes.

3349
02:19:37,790 --> 02:19:42,790
That is.
I don't care if you're a band or you're 

3350
02:19:42,790 --> 02:19:42,790
a journalist,
like whatever you're doing.

3351
02:19:42,790 --> 02:19:45,920
That guy has killed a lot of people and 
laughs about it.

3352
02:19:45,921 --> 02:19:47,210
Yeah.
Yeah.

3353
02:19:47,360 --> 02:19:49,340
You know the super bowl ring story.
No,

3354
02:19:49,460 --> 02:19:51,210
you don't want to hear this.
Oh,

3355
02:19:51,950 --> 02:19:56,950
find google it.
So I don't fuck up the stats because a 

3356
02:19:56,950 --> 02:19:58,340
sturgeon simpson actually told me this.
The,

3357
02:19:58,341 --> 02:20:03,341
um,
there was a super bowl winner who 

3358
02:20:03,341 --> 02:20:04,400
visited putin and as he's talking to 
putin,

3359
02:20:04,401 --> 02:20:09,401
putin asked him to see the ranks.
You've got the super bowl ring and a 

3360
02:20:09,401 --> 02:20:11,480
putin holds onto it,
puts it on his finger and walks away.

3361
02:20:12,890 --> 02:20:14,360
And then the guy starts going,
hey,

3362
02:20:14,361 --> 02:20:17,030
that's a vote in putin's bodyguards.
Put their hand on a guy like,

3363
02:20:17,031 --> 02:20:18,750
no.
So over.

3364
02:20:19,080 --> 02:20:20,300
Oh my god.
You fucking ring.

3365
02:20:21,430 --> 02:20:21,940
Yes,

3366
02:20:22,560 --> 02:20:27,560
my friend sandy.
While we're just given out a sandy my 

3367
02:20:29,931 --> 02:20:33,080
ring and he said,
why don't you show it to the president,

3368
02:20:34,610 --> 02:20:39,610
showed it to him and he put it on and 
kept it.

3369
02:20:44,960 --> 02:20:49,960
He helps his version of it there.
There's a version of it in an actual 

3370
02:20:49,960 --> 02:20:51,200
article that's more detailed where he 
talks about how they,

3371
02:20:51,230 --> 02:20:53,660
you know,
he asked for it back and they were like,

3372
02:20:53,661 --> 02:20:53,870
no,

3373
02:20:54,050 --> 02:20:59,050
here's what happened.
The other thing is how he traveled 

3374
02:20:59,050 --> 02:20:59,050
Angola,
merkel,

3375
02:20:59,050 --> 02:21:00,020
you know this story now,
angela merkel is headed german,

3376
02:21:00,021 --> 02:21:02,210
chancellor Germany.
She's terrified of dogs,

3377
02:21:02,780 --> 02:21:05,540
so he brings out his giant,
like black lab,

3378
02:21:05,541 --> 02:21:10,541
which are the sweetest braid and this is
look up merkel put and dog and she's 

3379
02:21:10,541 --> 02:21:12,680
sitting there terrified to look at it 
and the dog sniffing her.

3380
02:21:12,681 --> 02:21:16,640
It's like a lab and he's just sitting 
there fucking laughing like an asshole.

3381
02:21:16,641 --> 02:21:17,180
And he's like,
oh,

3382
02:21:17,181 --> 02:21:19,340
I didn't know.
She was scared of dogs for like how many

3383
02:21:19,341 --> 02:21:24,341
world leaders that you're bringing your 
dog out to meet other than her and the 

3384
02:21:24,341 --> 02:21:24,341
body language and her.
Yeah,

3385
02:21:24,341 --> 02:21:26,000
look at her.
She's freaking the fuck out.

3386
02:21:26,001 --> 02:21:29,780
Oh look at her.
And I was scared of dogs either,

3387
02:21:29,781 --> 02:21:31,250
by the way,
at a lab.

3388
02:21:31,380 --> 02:21:32,050
Come on.
Yeah,

3389
02:21:32,390 --> 02:21:33,440
fucking weird.
Look at her.

3390
02:21:33,441 --> 02:21:34,580
She's like,
ah,

3391
02:21:34,660 --> 02:21:38,540
not fart in Ireland.
That was so funny.

3392
02:21:38,780 --> 02:21:41,120
Yeah,
he's an asshole.

3393
02:21:41,630 --> 02:21:42,650
He's,
um,

3394
02:21:43,250 --> 02:21:46,190
it's,
it's very strange what he's been able to

3395
02:21:46,191 --> 02:21:47,300
do.
Oh yeah.

3396
02:21:47,390 --> 02:21:52,390
Did you see the assassination attempt 
where the guy drove into his car full 

3397
02:21:52,390 --> 02:21:56,471
clip,
changed lanes on the highway and went 

3398
02:21:56,471 --> 02:21:57,260
into the oncoming lane into the fast 
lane on the other side.

3399
02:21:57,620 --> 02:22:00,380
Full clips slammed into his car and 
killed his driver.

3400
02:22:00,381 --> 02:22:02,120
But he wasn't in the car.
Oh my god.

3401
02:22:02,121 --> 02:22:04,220
No,
it's wild.

3402
02:22:04,820 --> 02:22:08,120
It's wild.
It was an assassination attempt and they

3403
02:22:08,121 --> 02:22:09,560
just didn't know that he wasn't in the 
car.

3404
02:22:09,561 --> 02:22:11,720
But the fact that they were able to cut 
through the lanes.

3405
02:22:11,721 --> 02:22:13,820
Yeah.
Get into the center where,

3406
02:22:13,821 --> 02:22:14,900
you know,
they're there,

3407
02:22:15,680 --> 02:22:20,680
they have access to the oncoming lanes 
and pick his car right out of all the 

3408
02:22:21,171 --> 02:22:26,171
car.
Meaning it had to be coordinated with 

3409
02:22:26,171 --> 02:22:26,171
someone.
Right.

3410
02:22:26,171 --> 02:22:26,171
Because there's got to be a motorcade,
right?

3411
02:22:26,171 --> 02:22:26,171
Because.
Well,

3412
02:22:26,171 --> 02:22:27,120
they're out here.
Wow.

3413
02:22:27,270 --> 02:22:28,230
Oh,
that's it already.

3414
02:22:28,670 --> 02:22:29,910
Oh,
just keeps running it by.

3415
02:22:30,030 --> 02:22:31,380
Oh,
but just do it from the beginning.

3416
02:22:32,190 --> 02:22:34,290
The beginning wasn't gold.
There's a better version of it.

3417
02:22:34,291 --> 02:22:37,320
Then there's a better version of it out 
there and the better version of it.

3418
02:22:37,321 --> 02:22:39,960
You see the guy changed lanes.
Foam.

3419
02:22:39,990 --> 02:22:44,990
Yeah.
And slam in and had to know that that's 

3420
02:22:44,990 --> 02:22:45,150
where his car was.
Killed.

3421
02:22:45,151 --> 02:22:46,710
Him.
Killed the driver,

3422
02:22:46,711 --> 02:22:49,280
but putin was not in the car,
but it was putin's car.

3423
02:22:49,330 --> 02:22:50,910
He's magic.
Well,

3424
02:22:50,911 --> 02:22:55,911
he just knew something was up.
I mean he must have a bunch of people 

3425
02:22:55,911 --> 02:22:58,950
feeding them information all the time.
And how many assassination attempts have

3426
02:22:58,951 --> 02:23:00,060
there been on that guy?
Well,

3427
02:23:00,061 --> 02:23:05,061
I mean,
what about the assassination of sun on 

3428
02:23:05,061 --> 02:23:05,061
the presidents that we don't hear about?
Both obama and trump.

3429
02:23:05,061 --> 02:23:06,300
There have been plenty.
Really?

3430
02:23:06,330 --> 02:23:08,690
Yes.
But what ones do you look at?

3431
02:23:08,710 --> 02:23:10,710
I mean they just trump.
Yes.

3432
02:23:10,850 --> 02:23:11,820
Really?
A red horse.

3433
02:23:11,821 --> 02:23:14,280
Yes.
I haven't heard anything of course,

3434
02:23:14,281 --> 02:23:16,670
because they don't want to talk about it
[inaudible] then he hit the victim and.

3435
02:23:16,830 --> 02:23:18,750
And also you don't want to get these 
people's attention.

3436
02:23:18,900 --> 02:23:21,150
In all fairness.
I think that's a good move to be like,

3437
02:23:21,151 --> 02:23:22,350
all right,
let's not talk about this.

3438
02:23:22,910 --> 02:23:27,910
Like you don't want to talk about when 
terrorist attacks were foiled because 

3439
02:23:27,910 --> 02:23:27,910
then they'll know,
okay,

3440
02:23:27,910 --> 02:23:28,050
this doesn't work.
We're going to try it a different way.

3441
02:23:28,051 --> 02:23:29,610
So that's smarter.
The press I think,

3442
02:23:30,810 --> 02:23:32,500
you know,
but

3443
02:23:33,120 --> 02:23:35,640
I mean he's been able to run Russia for 
a long time.

3444
02:23:35,670 --> 02:23:37,410
Oh yeah.
I mean he had his number.

3445
02:23:37,470 --> 02:23:40,040
It was like teddy roosevelt and taft.
He had his number two there was terminal

3446
02:23:40,041 --> 02:23:41,190
and mitzi goes,
you're gonna be president.

3447
02:23:41,191 --> 02:23:41,670
I was like,
okay,

3448
02:23:41,671 --> 02:23:43,140
I'm done now I'm going to be back in.
The guy's like,

3449
02:23:43,141 --> 02:23:44,340
okay,
here you go mr putin.

3450
02:23:44,410 --> 02:23:46,650
But that's what's crazy is he got back 
in and everybody's like,

3451
02:23:46,651 --> 02:23:48,040
okay.
And his approval rating.

3452
02:23:48,041 --> 02:23:50,170
so like 70 percent.
Something crazy there.

3453
02:23:50,200 --> 02:23:55,200
Some huge number of the russians love.
Do they love him or do they say they 

3454
02:23:55,200 --> 02:23:55,260
love them because they're scared.
No,

3455
02:23:56,010 --> 02:24:01,010
russians love aggression.
We love someone who is nasty and an 

3456
02:24:01,860 --> 02:24:06,860
asshole.
Why is the assassination attempt on 

3457
02:24:06,860 --> 02:24:06,860
Donald Trump?
Bigger news.

3458
02:24:06,860 --> 02:24:10,790
What was the assassination attempt?
A 20 year old man in vegas pulled a gun 

3459
02:24:10,790 --> 02:24:14,601
from a las vegas polIce officer and 
tried to do a rally guy.

3460
02:24:15,710 --> 02:24:16,860
Boy,
don't tase me,

3461
02:24:16,861 --> 02:24:18,150
bro.
End of his life.

3462
02:24:18,620 --> 02:24:19,640
I,
I mean,

3463
02:24:19,680 --> 02:24:23,520
that's come on at 20 years old probably,
you know,

3464
02:24:23,640 --> 02:24:28,640
from britain,
I think you need overstayed his visa or 

3465
02:24:28,640 --> 02:24:29,950
something like wow,
crazy man

3466
02:24:31,850 --> 02:24:36,850
wasn't he trumped just giving a talk and
there was a was trump and there was a 

3467
02:24:36,850 --> 02:24:36,850
boom and he goes,
you missed.

3468
02:24:37,270 --> 02:24:39,150
He allegedly trIed to pull a gun from 
the holster.

3469
02:24:39,170 --> 02:24:41,840
The police officer at a trump rally in 
las vegas on saturday.

3470
02:24:42,020 --> 02:24:47,020
He was arrested and later secret service
that he had driven to the advent from 

3471
02:24:47,020 --> 02:24:50,060
California and had been planning to kill
the candidate for a year.

3472
02:24:50,240 --> 02:24:54,050
So this was before he was president,
or maybe it's 2016.

3473
02:24:54,051 --> 02:24:55,070
June.
June.

3474
02:24:55,430 --> 02:24:56,900
Yeah.
So a few months before the election.

3475
02:24:56,930 --> 02:24:59,810
But this.
There's been other attempts on him since

3476
02:24:59,811 --> 02:25:00,590
he's the president.
Yeah.

3477
02:25:00,740 --> 02:25:04,190
Other one says it was an isis attempt,
but this is from the daily beast.

3478
02:25:04,191 --> 02:25:04,880
So I don't know

3479
02:25:06,080 --> 02:25:06,300
how

3480
02:25:07,950 --> 02:25:09,740
well they're not going to be pro trump.
So if they're saying it,

3481
02:25:09,741 --> 02:25:09,980
I'm sure.

3482
02:25:12,020 --> 02:25:13,700
Yeah.
Well,

3483
02:25:15,580 --> 02:25:17,540
it's crazy that he wanted the job.
Well,

3484
02:25:17,541 --> 02:25:19,370
it's scary for mean.
I mean,

3485
02:25:19,400 --> 02:25:21,940
look at gabby giffords in Arizona.
I mean,

3486
02:25:21,990 --> 02:25:24,360
I don't believe in voting,
but she had this tweet about like,

3487
02:25:24,370 --> 02:25:29,370
uh,
she went and voted and I couldn't think 

3488
02:25:29,370 --> 02:25:29,370
of a better pro voting argument that she
kinda is like,

3489
02:25:29,370 --> 02:25:29,440
look,
you know,

3490
02:25:29,500 --> 02:25:31,490
you don't believe in voting voting.
Yeah.

3491
02:25:31,750 --> 02:25:32,980
Um,
what does that mean?

3492
02:25:33,550 --> 02:25:35,200
I don't believe in voting.
What do you mean?

3493
02:25:35,410 --> 02:25:36,610
I don't think it's,
I don't do it.

3494
02:25:36,611 --> 02:25:41,611
I don't,
I never wrote an article about it for 

3495
02:25:41,611 --> 02:25:41,611
the guardian.
Uh,

3496
02:25:41,611 --> 02:25:41,980
I just don't think it's legitimate 
voting democracy.

3497
02:25:42,070 --> 02:25:43,600
In what way?
in any way.

3498
02:25:43,630 --> 02:25:48,630
Like the idea that I flick a switch and 
someone gets to talk to me for four 

3499
02:25:48,630 --> 02:25:48,630
years,
taught for before years doesn't make any

3500
02:25:48,630 --> 02:25:50,650
sense.
What do you think the alternative should

3501
02:25:50,651 --> 02:25:51,280
be?
Freedom.

3502
02:25:51,880 --> 02:25:54,070
If I want to someone to speak for me,
I'll hire them.

3503
02:25:55,330 --> 02:26:00,330
And the idea that me and my neighbors 
have to be locked into some policy 

3504
02:26:00,330 --> 02:26:00,850
because we're geographically close to 
each other.

3505
02:26:00,851 --> 02:26:03,820
His landline technology and a posts cell
phone world.

3506
02:26:05,020 --> 02:26:06,580
So how do you think things should be 
run?

3507
02:26:07,210 --> 02:26:12,210
You organize based on how,
who you want to align with on any given 

3508
02:26:12,210 --> 02:26:15,930
a context.
Like I'm aligned with macy's when it 

3509
02:26:15,930 --> 02:26:16,990
comes to my clothes and I'm aligned with
you when it comes to talking.

3510
02:26:17,200 --> 02:26:21,250
You don't have to have one guy speak for
you for abortion and for uh,

3511
02:26:21,370 --> 02:26:24,420
the borders and for taxes.
I mean,

3512
02:26:24,430 --> 02:26:26,350
I don't believe in any of that stuff.
This is very old,

3513
02:26:26,380 --> 02:26:30,010
old model.
I agree that it's a very old model,

3514
02:26:30,011 --> 02:26:32,380
but the problem is we don't have any 
other one.

3515
02:26:32,620 --> 02:26:37,620
Sure we do because one of the other 99 
percent of our interactions are 

3516
02:26:37,620 --> 02:26:41,011
voluntary and you come together with 
people as you need to and then you go 

3517
02:26:41,011 --> 02:26:41,920
your separate ways and it's very,
very dynamic.

3518
02:26:41,920 --> 02:26:46,920
So this idea that you're stuck with this
person because a lot of people like him 

3519
02:26:46,920 --> 02:26:49,120
for four years and they speak for you.
It makes no sense to me.

3520
02:26:49,390 --> 02:26:54,390
It does not make sense,
but it's also we feel like we need some 

3521
02:26:54,390 --> 02:26:57,211
sort of a representation of us.
If you're going to have some sort of a 

3522
02:26:57,211 --> 02:26:57,640
summit with a guy like putin,
sure,

3523
02:26:57,700 --> 02:27:00,100
or someone kim jong moon or whatever it 
is,

3524
02:27:00,130 --> 02:27:02,530
whoever it is,
someone needs to speak for us.

3525
02:27:02,620 --> 02:27:03,340
Sure.
Right,

3526
02:27:03,341 --> 02:27:05,140
and I mean in the sense that is a 
reaction,

3527
02:27:05,170 --> 02:27:10,170
but the point is I don't.
The vast majority of people in this 

3528
02:27:10,170 --> 02:27:10,170
country,
we're not a vast.

3529
02:27:10,170 --> 02:27:10,930
A lot of people say,
trump's not my president.

3530
02:27:10,931 --> 02:27:15,010
he doesn't speak for me and they have a 
right to say that and the idea that just

3531
02:27:15,011 --> 02:27:17,680
because someone wins a contest,
therefore he's the boss of me.

3532
02:27:17,710 --> 02:27:22,710
Well,
what do you think about voting when it 

3533
02:27:22,710 --> 02:27:22,710
comes to legitimate concerns?
Like raising the speed limit,

3534
02:27:22,710 --> 02:27:23,800
reducing taxes,
doing this,

3535
02:27:23,801 --> 02:27:25,510
doing that,
like fixing roads,

3536
02:27:25,530 --> 02:27:28,840
like certain things that we need to get 
done.

3537
02:27:30,280 --> 02:27:31,300
I don't.
I don't do it.

3538
02:27:31,850 --> 02:27:35,410
I mean that makes more sense to me 
because it's a direct representation,

3539
02:27:35,411 --> 02:27:37,300
but even that shouldn't be up to 
majority rule.

3540
02:27:37,750 --> 02:27:42,750
I mean people who understand the 
dynamics of speed limits in cars should 

3541
02:27:42,750 --> 02:27:43,870
have informed say rather than.
Right.

3542
02:27:43,871 --> 02:27:46,660
But then there's influenced by the 
insurance companies,

3543
02:27:46,661 --> 02:27:49,710
and this is why low rates,
this is why things changed,

3544
02:27:49,720 --> 02:27:52,480
but didn't she got lost.
But insurance companies are the ones who

3545
02:27:52,481 --> 02:27:55,150
have the campaigns to force people to 
vote one way or another.

3546
02:27:55,240 --> 02:27:56,400
It's going to be one,
right?

3547
02:27:56,440 --> 02:27:58,960
One side's going to have much more like 
marijuana laws,

3548
02:27:59,280 --> 02:28:04,280
you know,
and all these tobacco and alcohol 

3549
02:28:04,280 --> 02:28:04,280
companies trying to make sure that 
marijuana is not legal.

3550
02:28:04,280 --> 02:28:05,090
Uh,
and all these,

3551
02:28:05,230 --> 02:28:07,540
this propaganda you have because they 
don't want competitors.

3552
02:28:07,780 --> 02:28:09,640
Would you rather have people be high 
than drunk?

3553
02:28:10,120 --> 02:28:13,330
Like if dad's coming home from work,
I'd rather he had a joint that,

3554
02:28:13,331 --> 02:28:14,430
a six pack.
I mean,

3555
02:28:14,830 --> 02:28:17,170
and yet historically it's just because 
alcohol has been popular.

3556
02:28:17,500 --> 02:28:19,000
That's what's legal.
It makes no sense.

3557
02:28:19,090 --> 02:28:22,310
No drunk driving versus driving stoned.
I mean,

3558
02:28:22,311 --> 02:28:24,310
one guy's going to slow the other ones,
you know.

3559
02:28:24,670 --> 02:28:29,670
Well,
one's got probably paranoid to and 

3560
02:28:29,670 --> 02:28:29,670
checking every mirror,
checking a bag,

3561
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:32,990
a cool drive slower,
slow down Cuba together,

3562
02:28:33,060 --> 02:28:34,220
writing the lines,
right?

3563
02:28:34,280 --> 02:28:36,290
Yeah.
Yeah.

3564
02:28:36,291 --> 02:28:41,291
I don't,
I don't think that the system that we 

3565
02:28:41,291 --> 02:28:43,460
have now is great,
but to just not participate at all,

3566
02:28:43,520 --> 02:28:46,010
but I do participate.
Obviously if I'm a public figure and I'm

3567
02:28:46,011 --> 02:28:48,740
talking is participating,
so just discourse.

3568
02:28:49,440 --> 02:28:50,960
You have to some extent.
Yeah,

3569
02:28:51,380 --> 02:28:56,380
I mean I don't think the idea that 
you're flicking a switch means you're 

3570
02:28:56,380 --> 02:28:56,380
actually making a difference.

3571
02:28:56,380 --> 02:28:58,340
I think her doing something in secret 
once every four years.

3572
02:28:58,370 --> 02:29:03,370
You're not actually participating.
That's something people like to tell 

3573
02:29:03,370 --> 02:29:03,560
themselves.
It's like getting a communion wafer.

3574
02:29:04,100 --> 02:29:09,100
do you think that it's archaic also to 
have this timeline of four years and 

3575
02:29:09,100 --> 02:29:11,150
especially when it comes to like 
registering to vote?

3576
02:29:11,240 --> 02:29:13,220
I think that's the most archaic thing 
ever,

3577
02:29:13,221 --> 02:29:18,221
that you have to go somewhere to do it,
but meanwhile you have a driver's 

3578
02:29:18,221 --> 02:29:19,250
license if you're driving around,
you have a driver's license.

3579
02:29:19,251 --> 02:29:21,320
If you have a driver's license,
you should be able to vote.

3580
02:29:21,650 --> 02:29:22,570
Sure.
Well,

3581
02:29:22,571 --> 02:29:24,600
not necessarily.
If you're a citizen now,

3582
02:29:24,970 --> 02:29:27,290
be a citizen to get it out and if you're
a citizen.

3583
02:29:27,291 --> 02:29:28,610
Yeah.
And your.

3584
02:29:29,150 --> 02:29:34,150
What do you think about criminals being 
able to vote like this one that's a hot 

3585
02:29:34,150 --> 02:29:34,150
topic?
Uh,

3586
02:29:34,150 --> 02:29:34,150
I,
I,

3587
02:29:34,150 --> 02:29:37,700
I think that there should be more like 
if you've done your time,

3588
02:29:37,701 --> 02:29:39,490
especially if I nonviolent crime,
right?

3589
02:29:39,730 --> 02:29:44,730
Uh,
I think what I'm really excited about 

3590
02:29:44,730 --> 02:29:46,751
what happened in politics this week was 
jeff sessions getting fired because he 

3591
02:29:47,150 --> 02:29:48,410
wouldn't.
Let me.

3592
02:29:48,440 --> 02:29:50,210
ThIs is one of the reasons I hate the 
press.

3593
02:29:50,510 --> 02:29:52,220
when kim kardashian went to the white 
house,

3594
02:29:52,221 --> 02:29:55,010
they all clowned her.
Kim kardashians saved the lady's life.

3595
02:29:55,640 --> 02:29:57,890
She saved someone's life.
So unless you save a life,

3596
02:29:57,891 --> 02:30:02,891
shut the fuck up.
You went to the white house to talk 

3597
02:30:02,891 --> 02:30:05,951
about prison reform and to talk about 
people who are innocent in jail right 

3598
02:30:05,951 --> 02:30:10,271
now.
And she brought the case to Donald 

3599
02:30:10,271 --> 02:30:10,271
Trump.
Mandatory minimums.

3600
02:30:10,271 --> 02:30:12,320
And you tell that lady's family.
We saw the footage of them crying.

3601
02:30:12,321 --> 02:30:13,610
You tell them,
oh ha ha.

3602
02:30:13,640 --> 02:30:15,380
Kim kardashian.
Kanye west.

3603
02:30:15,381 --> 02:30:18,350
When he went to the white house,
he talked prison reform.

3604
02:30:18,351 --> 02:30:19,780
He said,
people who are not vial,

3605
02:30:19,781 --> 02:30:20,230
blah,
blah.

3606
02:30:20,480 --> 02:30:24,500
The point is it will be the greatest 
thing for freedom ever if the republican

3607
02:30:24,501 --> 02:30:26,090
party,
traditionally law and order party,

3608
02:30:26,091 --> 02:30:31,091
we're in a position to be more liberal 
about prison sentence thing because a 

3609
02:30:31,091 --> 02:30:34,421
lot of these people don't need to be in 
jail even if they need to be punished 

3610
02:30:34,421 --> 02:30:37,110
and when you send someone to jail,
they're going to be terrorized and 

3611
02:30:37,110 --> 02:30:37,110
raped.

3612
02:30:37,110 --> 02:30:37,110
I mean,
if someone's dealing weed,

3613
02:30:37,110 --> 02:30:41,441
is that really appropriate?
So sessions was when the big opponents 

3614
02:30:41,441 --> 02:30:41,441
of this,
he's.

3615
02:30:41,441 --> 02:30:43,700
He thinks marijuana and heroin are 
basically the same.

3616
02:30:43,701 --> 02:30:48,701
So if he's gone,
this is a great opportunitY for both 

3617
02:30:48,701 --> 02:30:52,121
parties to work together and a lot of 
these people do not need to be in jail 

3618
02:30:52,121 --> 02:30:52,121
and it's expensive as fuck.
Yeah,

3619
02:30:52,121 --> 02:30:53,750
I,
I couldn'T agree more.

3620
02:30:53,930 --> 02:30:58,930
he also said something that was one of 
the most ridiculous things I've ever 

3621
02:30:58,930 --> 02:30:58,930
heard.
Good people don't smoke marijuana.

3622
02:30:58,930 --> 02:31:00,830
that's really.
Have you done a survey?

3623
02:31:00,980 --> 02:31:02,960
Like what the fuck?
What are you talking about?

3624
02:31:02,980 --> 02:31:07,980
Well,
he lives in some 19 fifties norman 

3625
02:31:07,980 --> 02:31:07,980
rockwell painting,
but in the,

3626
02:31:07,980 --> 02:31:12,040
in 19 fifties,
there are good people who smoke 

3627
02:31:12,040 --> 02:31:12,040
marijuana,
jack kerouac.

3628
02:31:12,040 --> 02:31:12,040
That's a good person.
But it's what I'm saying,

3629
02:31:12,040 --> 02:31:15,350
it's like he lives in an idealistic 
portrayal of life,

3630
02:31:15,680 --> 02:31:20,680
not life itself,
but it's such blanket statements which 

3631
02:31:20,680 --> 02:31:20,680
are usually a fan of.

3632
02:31:20,680 --> 02:31:21,480
But yeah,
like fuck you.

3633
02:31:21,540 --> 02:31:25,230
But he was an asshole long time ago.
I mean that guy has been a piece of shit

3634
02:31:25,231 --> 02:31:30,231
for a long time.
If you go back and some of his choices 

3635
02:31:30,231 --> 02:31:30,720
and some of those decisions,
what decades ago,

3636
02:31:30,990 --> 02:31:33,210
he was thought to be too creepy for the 
supreme court.

3637
02:31:33,211 --> 02:31:35,190
He was thought to be too creepy for 
politics.

3638
02:31:35,191 --> 02:31:36,540
He was thought to be.
I mean,

3639
02:31:36,541 --> 02:31:38,670
he's just a scary guy.
Well Now he's gone.

3640
02:31:38,671 --> 02:31:40,200
Thankfully.
So I.

3641
02:31:40,201 --> 02:31:41,880
But people,
some people are supporting him.

3642
02:31:42,070 --> 02:31:43,740
Look,
the president forced him out.

3643
02:31:43,920 --> 02:31:48,920
Good.
If that's the best endorsement of trump 

3644
02:31:48,920 --> 02:31:51,501
I fucking heard.
And what's amazing is like different 

3645
02:31:51,501 --> 02:31:53,661
states.
Republicans supposedlY for the last 

3646
02:31:53,661 --> 02:31:53,661
whatever decades were for states' 
rights,

3647
02:31:53,661 --> 02:31:55,110
let's every state decide they can 
compete.

3648
02:31:55,410 --> 02:31:58,180
We had that with marijuana legalization.
Son had full blown.

3649
02:31:58,200 --> 02:31:59,640
Some had medical,
some had none.

3650
02:31:59,820 --> 02:32:01,170
This is how it's supposed to work.

3651
02:32:01,170 --> 02:32:06,170
and sessions was one who was Like,
even though it's still ostensibly 

3652
02:32:06,170 --> 02:32:06,930
illegAl at the federal level,
is that a sessions like,

3653
02:32:07,110 --> 02:32:09,720
fuck you federal overrides,
we're going to have these rates.

3654
02:32:10,180 --> 02:32:15,180
Why leave them alone?
Let them decide on a state level like 

3655
02:32:15,180 --> 02:32:15,180
you said that.
But they never did it.

3656
02:32:15,180 --> 02:32:15,180
Right.
I,

3657
02:32:15,180 --> 02:32:17,400
I,
I know a lot of pushback by trump.

3658
02:32:17,401 --> 02:32:22,401
Good.
I know obama actually did have some 

3659
02:32:22,401 --> 02:32:22,401
rates.
it's just insaNe.

3660
02:32:22,401 --> 02:32:23,420
Like you were part of the tomb gang in 
high.

3661
02:32:23,460 --> 02:32:24,940
In high school or college,
right?

3662
02:32:24,950 --> 02:32:29,950
Yeah,
they did have some raids during his 

3663
02:32:29,950 --> 02:32:31,401
administration.
I was on a grand jury duty and I talked 

3664
02:32:31,401 --> 02:32:36,291
to the whole jury to let people off 
about a marijuana stuff because I'm 

3665
02:32:36,421 --> 02:32:37,740
like,
you don't have to indict on this.

3666
02:32:38,040 --> 02:32:39,720
Like why?
Why do you want to ruin someone's life?

3667
02:32:39,960 --> 02:32:42,870
What was the jury?
Now you have a bunch of cases,

3668
02:32:42,980 --> 02:32:44,580
you know,
said I can't get into specifics,

3669
02:32:44,581 --> 02:32:49,581
but I was like,
people are from all walks of life are 

3670
02:32:49,581 --> 02:32:51,090
very receptive to the idea of when you 
think about what jail means,

3671
02:32:51,860 --> 02:32:53,670
uh,
it's so fucked up.

3672
02:32:53,670 --> 02:32:54,480
And people are just like,
well,

3673
02:32:54,481 --> 02:32:59,481
someone does something wrong.
They should be punished even if someone 

3674
02:32:59,481 --> 02:33:01,911
should be punished.
The idea that that punishment should be 

3675
02:33:01,911 --> 02:33:01,911
jail is not the same thing.
Right.

3676
02:33:02,310 --> 02:33:07,310
And if someone's not at wouldn't,
wouldn't it be better if they had house 

3677
02:33:07,310 --> 02:33:07,310
arrest,
for example?

3678
02:33:07,310 --> 02:33:08,610
Why do you need them to be terrorized 
and locked in with a roommate?

3679
02:33:08,970 --> 02:33:10,910
I don't want a roommate.
Well,

3680
02:33:10,920 --> 02:33:15,920
not only that,
a roommate who's also locked in the 

3681
02:33:15,920 --> 02:33:15,920
cage.
Yeah.

3682
02:33:15,920 --> 02:33:16,590
And only around other males.
Yeah.

3683
02:33:17,160 --> 02:33:18,000
No,
it's dark.

3684
02:33:18,420 --> 02:33:23,420
And you know,
it goes back to what you're talking 

3685
02:33:23,420 --> 02:33:23,420
about early about empathy.
Yeah.

3686
02:33:23,420 --> 02:33:27,650
And how important that is and about how 
easy it is for people to just dismiss 

3687
02:33:27,650 --> 02:33:27,860
people.
Right?

3688
02:33:27,890 --> 02:33:29,910
You know what they call today,
the cancel culture.

3689
02:33:30,090 --> 02:33:32,030
Like people just want things cancel and 
just want things.

3690
02:33:32,060 --> 02:33:33,100
Shut them down.
Right.

3691
02:33:33,190 --> 02:33:34,470
Get rid of them,
forced them out.

3692
02:33:34,470 --> 02:33:36,510
Firearm,
take away his thing.

3693
02:33:36,580 --> 02:33:37,620
Takeaways,
gig.

3694
02:33:38,070 --> 02:33:41,190
I mean,
and then put them in jail like this.

3695
02:33:41,430 --> 02:33:44,880
Put them in jail thing.
To me it's like here's a big one.

3696
02:33:45,330 --> 02:33:48,450
Taxes.
Like if you don't pay your taxes,

3697
02:33:48,780 --> 02:33:50,520
that put you in jail.
What a child support.

3698
02:33:50,820 --> 02:33:52,980
Yeah.
Like there was this meme I saw were like

3699
02:33:53,010 --> 02:33:54,930
a woman doesn't pay child support.
She gets the government,

3700
02:33:55,380 --> 02:34:00,380
she gets an apartment and if a guy 
doesn't pitch outs where he goes to 

3701
02:34:00,380 --> 02:34:00,380
jail.
Yeah,

3702
02:34:00,380 --> 02:34:04,880
yeah.
And you can't earn any money from when 

3703
02:34:04,880 --> 02:34:04,880
you're in jail and all that money when 
you get out who's that helping?

3704
02:34:04,880 --> 02:34:07,800
And it's going to help someone that 
their dad's a jailbird now is it because

3705
02:34:07,801 --> 02:34:12,801
the resources aren't available to force 
the person to pay like there's not 

3706
02:34:12,801 --> 02:34:17,240
another.
So they try to make the punishment as 

3707
02:34:17,240 --> 02:34:18,730
terrible as possible so that you 
motivate them to shore.

3708
02:34:18,880 --> 02:34:23,880
But at a certain point it's like it's.
I don't think it's a conscionable to 

3709
02:34:23,880 --> 02:34:27,781
really be sending a jail is so bad.
It really needs to be someone who's a 

3710
02:34:27,781 --> 02:34:28,990
danger to society if they're walking 
around.

3711
02:34:29,110 --> 02:34:30,220
I agree.
I agree.

3712
02:34:30,420 --> 02:34:31,540
Um,
and again,

3713
02:34:31,600 --> 02:34:33,930
even the Martha Stewart model,
it would be so much happier for a lot of

3714
02:34:33,940 --> 02:34:35,380
these people were just locked in their 
house.

3715
02:34:35,750 --> 02:34:40,750
Yeah.
Why do They need to be able to go to 

3716
02:34:40,750 --> 02:34:40,750
jail?
Yeah.

3717
02:34:40,750 --> 02:34:40,750
But afterwards I've actually had the 
ankle bracelet,

3718
02:34:40,750 --> 02:34:44,700
like why is that?
like once you start asking those 

3719
02:34:44,700 --> 02:34:46,711
questions,
what will matter for you if it's an 

3720
02:34:46,711 --> 02:34:48,511
ankle bracelet or if they're in jail,
would it matter that you've put them on 

3721
02:34:48,511 --> 02:34:51,631
some island and they couldn't do that 
and then people don't even think in 

3722
02:34:51,631 --> 02:34:51,631
those terms.
Well,

3723
02:34:51,631 --> 02:34:52,570
because you lose your humanity once 
you're a criminal,

3724
02:34:52,571 --> 02:34:54,950
it's like you're not a human being and,
and it's,

3725
02:34:55,070 --> 02:35:00,070
it's,
it's wait until wait until there's a 

3726
02:35:00,070 --> 02:35:03,061
joke that like a conservative as a 
liberal who's been mugged and a liberal 

3727
02:35:03,061 --> 02:35:03,670
is a conservative who's had interactions
with the law.

3728
02:35:04,300 --> 02:35:05,800
It's like once you interact with the 
law,

3729
02:35:05,801 --> 02:35:07,600
my friend ally's oral and she's a public
defender.

3730
02:35:07,601 --> 02:35:12,601
She is great.
It's like it's really easy once the eye 

3731
02:35:12,601 --> 02:35:13,720
of sauron is on you and you're a 
criminal,

3732
02:35:13,960 --> 02:35:16,690
shit goes out the window really fucking 
quick and it's very scary.

3733
02:35:16,780 --> 02:35:21,780
Right?
And there's people that are prosecutors 

3734
02:35:21,780 --> 02:35:24,450
that are trying to win.
They're trying to win a case and that's 

3735
02:35:24,450 --> 02:35:28,021
what their job is.
Their job is not to make sure that 

3736
02:35:28,021 --> 02:35:31,051
everything is being done correctly and 
that you are being represented 

3737
02:35:31,051 --> 02:35:31,660
accurately and that.
No,

3738
02:35:31,680 --> 02:35:32,010
no,
no.

3739
02:35:32,210 --> 02:35:32,630
The,
the,

3740
02:35:32,690 --> 02:35:36,040
the job is there is a case,
the cases against you,

3741
02:35:36,041 --> 02:35:38,380
you're on trial when the trial,
right?

3742
02:35:38,530 --> 02:35:40,810
That's my job.
It's a game and it has to be their job.

3743
02:35:40,840 --> 02:35:41,740
Yes.
Well,

3744
02:35:41,741 --> 02:35:43,250
it becomes a game.
I mean that.

3745
02:35:43,260 --> 02:35:46,090
This is the problem that I've said with 
law enforcement period.

3746
02:35:46,240 --> 02:35:49,300
When cops see people,
They think of those people as a possible

3747
02:35:49,301 --> 02:35:52,390
arrest and there's a game and they've 
been lied to.

3748
02:35:52,391 --> 02:35:53,270
By so many people.
I mean,

3749
02:35:53,290 --> 02:35:55,570
you're a cop.
You're dealing with people all day long.

3750
02:35:55,571 --> 02:35:57,730
They're lying to you.
You meet some new person.

3751
02:35:57,731 --> 02:36:00,040
You automatically assume they're lying 
to you as well,

3752
02:36:00,760 --> 02:36:05,760
and then things get weird.
There's a great video called do not 

3753
02:36:05,760 --> 02:36:06,160
cooperate with the police and it was 
like a law professor,

3754
02:36:06,161 --> 02:36:11,161
I believe,
and he had the cop standing right next 

3755
02:36:11,161 --> 02:36:12,901
to him.
He told the cop anything I say that's 

3756
02:36:12,901 --> 02:36:14,521
wrong.
Please jump in and correct me and his 

3757
02:36:14,521 --> 02:36:14,521
broad point,
I'll just sum it up quickly is you can't

3758
02:36:14,521 --> 02:36:16,090
talk your way out of an arrest,
but you can talk your way into one,

3759
02:36:16,670 --> 02:36:18,730
so he's like,
do not ever talk to them.

3760
02:36:18,731 --> 02:36:20,410
Just say thank you.
I know you're doing your job,

3761
02:36:20,411 --> 02:36:25,411
but I can't cooperate until I have an 
attorney present because there's no 

3762
02:36:25,411 --> 02:36:25,411
upside.

3763
02:36:25,411 --> 02:36:27,190
And then.
And they'd say to you explicitly,

3764
02:36:27,580 --> 02:36:31,810
anything you say can and will be used 
against you if like,

3765
02:36:31,811 --> 02:36:33,480
hey joe,
can I borrow that screwdriver?

3766
02:36:33,520 --> 02:36:35,650
I can and will use it against you.
No,

3767
02:36:35,800 --> 02:36:38,230
you cannot borrow my scrEwdriver.
I need my eyes.

3768
02:36:39,550 --> 02:36:40,200
Yeah.
The,

3769
02:36:40,320 --> 02:36:43,930
the ultimate legal case.
Public legal case.

3770
02:36:44,550 --> 02:36:49,550
Uh,
or one of the ultimate ones is julian 

3771
02:36:49,550 --> 02:36:49,550
assange.
Oh yeah,

3772
02:36:49,550 --> 02:36:50,590
that's a weird thing.
He hasn't seen sunlight and months.

3773
02:36:51,340 --> 02:36:52,360
No.
Internet access.

3774
02:36:52,390 --> 02:36:53,530
No.
Internet access.

3775
02:36:53,700 --> 02:36:54,970
yeah.
They showed them the intimacy.

3776
02:36:54,971 --> 02:36:56,350
Yeah.
And they're trying to kick them out now.

3777
02:36:56,351 --> 02:36:57,850
Ecuador.
But where's he to go?

3778
02:36:57,950 --> 02:36:58,690
He,
if he goes,

3779
02:36:58,691 --> 02:36:59,680
he's good at what they want them.
What?

3780
02:36:59,681 --> 02:37:00,640
Sweden.
They want him.

3781
02:37:00,641 --> 02:37:03,370
They want him in britain and I don't 
think they've been charges filed against

3782
02:37:03,371 --> 02:37:04,450
him here yet,
technically,

3783
02:37:04,660 --> 02:37:08,020
but I'm sure that they want his head on 
a platter to what they want him for.

3784
02:37:08,020 --> 02:37:09,750
So preposterous.
It's so nice.

3785
02:37:10,070 --> 02:37:12,550
It's like a wannabe capone.
Yeah.

3786
02:37:12,910 --> 02:37:15,410
Yeah.
Excavation instead of being a mobster.

3787
02:37:15,500 --> 02:37:16,190
Right?
Yeah,

3788
02:37:16,191 --> 02:37:21,191
but it's.
It's interesting because I would think 

3789
02:37:21,191 --> 02:37:24,401
that someone like trump who is such a 
conspiracy minded person would actually 

3790
02:37:24,590 --> 02:37:28,360
like juliana massage because I'm sure 
there's been.

3791
02:37:28,460 --> 02:37:33,460
I mean,
I don't know what he's ever said in the 

3792
02:37:33,460 --> 02:37:33,500
past.
He was anti wiki leaks from the start.

3793
02:37:33,520 --> 02:37:34,030
No,
but I.

3794
02:37:34,070 --> 02:37:36,410
He said things about juliana signs that 
were anti.

3795
02:37:36,560 --> 02:37:37,490
That's my understanding.
Yeah.

3796
02:37:38,170 --> 02:37:40,760
That's because there was something 
julian assange tweeted,

3797
02:37:40,761 --> 02:37:41,890
my friend,
cassandra fairbank's,

3798
02:37:41,930 --> 02:37:43,790
she's a big support of him and she's 
like,

3799
02:37:43,791 --> 02:37:45,530
well,
there goes to the idea of clemency or.

3800
02:37:45,590 --> 02:37:46,760
Pardon?
Oh really?

3801
02:37:46,761 --> 02:37:49,820
Yeah.
So trump tweeted,

3802
02:37:49,821 --> 02:37:51,100
or julian,
I think.

3803
02:37:51,610 --> 02:37:51,920
Yeah.

3804
02:37:54,060 --> 02:37:55,910
It's a piece of praise.
The virtual prisoner.

3805
02:37:56,020 --> 02:37:56,530
Yeah.
It's like,

3806
02:37:56,690 --> 02:37:59,450
where's that end?
It's not gonna end.

3807
02:37:59,451 --> 02:38:01,760
Well,
he can get visitors though.

3808
02:38:01,960 --> 02:38:03,770
I don't can anderson.
Oh,

3809
02:38:03,771 --> 02:38:04,260
that's right.
Yeah.

3810
02:38:04,261 --> 02:38:04,480
Yeah.
Well,

3811
02:38:04,510 --> 02:38:07,550
but they may have taken that away.
Taking that away.

3812
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:11,960
I wonder how long he could stay there.
That it's been years.

3813
02:38:12,080 --> 02:38:13,160
Years.
It's been years.

3814
02:38:13,190 --> 02:38:15,560
Years to be in one building.
Yeah.

3815
02:38:15,561 --> 02:38:17,090
And he,
he doesn't go outside anymore.

3816
02:38:17,120 --> 02:38:18,800
He can't,
they won't let them.

3817
02:38:18,860 --> 02:38:20,570
I don't think.
I don't think he ever could.

3818
02:38:20,630 --> 02:38:21,970
Went on the balcony.
Okay.

3819
02:38:22,040 --> 02:38:24,410
Now I know he doesn't see sunlight that 
I'm positive.

3820
02:38:24,620 --> 02:38:27,440
That's terrible to they given vitamin d 
at least.

3821
02:38:28,160 --> 02:38:28,790
No.
Yeah,

3822
02:38:28,791 --> 02:38:29,570
I dunno.
I dunno.

3823
02:38:30,020 --> 02:38:35,020
I mean he's awfully pale to begin with,
but if you don't get vitamin d like you 

3824
02:38:35,020 --> 02:38:35,450
can get really sick,
but that's what they do in North Korea.

3825
02:38:35,451 --> 02:38:36,620
They get our skin starts falling off 
there.

3826
02:38:36,620 --> 02:38:41,620
Has been there since June 19th of 2012.
We entered the embassy at six years.

3827
02:38:42,620 --> 02:38:46,940
Whoa.
Whoa.

3828
02:38:47,500 --> 02:38:49,190
Christ.
How much?

3829
02:38:49,670 --> 02:38:52,490
Almost six and a half years.
June.

3830
02:38:52,550 --> 02:38:57,120
How much solitaire can you play and you 
don't even have internet anymore.

3831
02:38:57,140 --> 02:38:59,710
He isn't an internet for how many months
I'm looking at.

3832
02:39:00,490 --> 02:39:02,390
I want to say it's about him.
About four or five months.

3833
02:39:02,420 --> 02:39:07,420
It's been awhile.
I think it was March 27th.

3834
02:39:08,150 --> 02:39:13,150
They were suspended for eight months for
the second time.

3835
02:39:14,060 --> 02:39:15,620
It's October,
2016.

3836
02:39:15,920 --> 02:39:18,110
Fuck.
Who the hell's over at?

3837
02:39:18,111 --> 02:39:19,670
Wiki leaks.
Still running shit.

3838
02:39:21,280 --> 02:39:23,600
The intern who's hanging in there,
you know,

3839
02:39:24,170 --> 02:39:26,810
god.
That's crazy.

3840
02:39:27,500 --> 02:39:29,570
Like how does that one play out?
I mean they're,

3841
02:39:29,571 --> 02:39:34,571
they're,
they're really what they're doing for 

3842
02:39:34,571 --> 02:39:36,401
sure.
When we're talking about punishment 

3843
02:39:36,401 --> 02:39:36,401
being a deterrent and certain 
situations.

3844
02:39:36,440 --> 02:39:38,180
That is absolutely a deterrent.
Oh,

3845
02:39:38,181 --> 02:39:39,790
they're making an example of him for 
whistle blowers.

3846
02:39:40,040 --> 02:39:41,330
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.

3847
02:39:41,390 --> 02:39:44,390
Whereas chelsea manning's out now.
She just had her surgery.

3848
02:39:45,050 --> 02:39:46,640
What surgery though?
Per transgender.

3849
02:39:46,900 --> 02:39:48,650
She got there.
She tweeted out.

3850
02:39:48,651 --> 02:39:50,030
I have,
I have a vagina.

3851
02:39:50,210 --> 02:39:51,650
Oh,
okay.

3852
02:39:53,900 --> 02:39:55,190
Yeah.
WeLl there you go.

3853
02:39:55,310 --> 02:39:56,690
Yeah,
she's out.

3854
02:39:56,780 --> 02:39:57,620
She's out.
She's out.

3855
02:39:57,680 --> 02:40:00,350
Hobnobbing and maybe using that thing.
I met her.

3856
02:40:00,351 --> 02:40:02,480
She came to an event.
She was very nice.

3857
02:40:03,150 --> 02:40:07,190
Very sure.
But she's out.

3858
02:40:07,460 --> 02:40:09,140
She's out.
She's been out for obama.

3859
02:40:09,141 --> 02:40:10,520
Pardoned her computer.
Her sentence.

3860
02:40:11,090 --> 02:40:15,470
He's locked away forever in the embassy.
And then there's snowden.

3861
02:40:15,740 --> 02:40:18,890
Who is also hiding in Russia.
Right?

3862
02:40:19,330 --> 02:40:21,060
What actually a lot of these.
Yeah,

3863
02:40:21,100 --> 02:40:22,110
there's paula.

3864
02:40:24,370 --> 02:40:26,860
After almost a decade of fighting 
through prison.

3865
02:40:27,310 --> 02:40:32,310
The courts,
a hunger strike and through the 

3866
02:40:32,310 --> 02:40:32,560
insurance company.
I finally got surgery this week.

3867
02:40:32,590 --> 02:40:34,540
Not lasik apparently.
Oh,

3868
02:40:34,541 --> 02:40:37,690
you suddenly switch just wearing glasses
folks.

3869
02:40:38,260 --> 02:40:43,260
Um,
it was a mill house is going to be in 

3870
02:40:43,260 --> 02:40:46,231
Russia probably forever eight.
Had a lot of these farmers from South 

3871
02:40:46,231 --> 02:40:46,231
Africa.
That's where they're going to.

3872
02:40:46,231 --> 02:40:47,080
Russia.
Putin is letting them in.

3873
02:40:47,330 --> 02:40:47,890
Really?
Yes.

3874
02:40:47,891 --> 02:40:50,080
So they better learn how to write those 
arms backward pretty quick.

3875
02:40:50,590 --> 02:40:52,240
Oh right.
They got weird ours.

3876
02:40:52,260 --> 02:40:53,080
Yeah.
Yeah.

3877
02:40:53,081 --> 02:40:55,990
Well you have to learn the whole,
the whole language and just a weird art.

3878
02:40:55,991 --> 02:40:58,550
It's just you guys.
Russians got a lot of weird ones.

3879
02:40:58,551 --> 02:41:01,030
So we do.
We got barely literate in Russia.

3880
02:41:01,060 --> 02:41:05,800
The letters look fake letters are fake,
but they look like alien language,

3881
02:41:05,801 --> 02:41:10,801
you know,
it was like somebody writing something 

3882
02:41:10,801 --> 02:41:12,451
that is a piece of metal from a 
spaceship like snowden is.

3883
02:41:13,300 --> 02:41:14,500
He's fucked too.
Right?

3884
02:41:14,530 --> 02:41:16,990
I mean he can't even be public in 
Russia.

3885
02:41:19,090 --> 02:41:20,470
I'm not sure about him.
I know,

3886
02:41:20,650 --> 02:41:21,240
I know.
It sounds.

3887
02:41:21,280 --> 02:41:26,280
I haven't been following stoughton.
He's deep under when they must know 

3888
02:41:26,280 --> 02:41:26,280
where he is though.
I mean there's no,

3889
02:41:26,280 --> 02:41:30,931
with the intelligence community is,
doesn't have a fucking full line on 

3890
02:41:30,931 --> 02:41:31,640
exactly where that guy is.
The question,

3891
02:41:31,660 --> 02:41:33,670
do they know all this stuff or are they 
incompetent?

3892
02:41:33,700 --> 02:41:36,210
And there's examples of both directions.
Yeah.

3893
02:41:36,280 --> 02:41:38,180
I got to think they know where snowden 
is.

3894
02:41:38,290 --> 02:41:41,020
Like glenn greenwald talks to them all 
the time.

3895
02:41:41,021 --> 02:41:42,370
Glenn greenwald in Brazil.
Yeah.

3896
02:41:42,400 --> 02:41:43,280
That was,
had gleaned,

3897
02:41:43,430 --> 02:41:46,250
kind of made his name.
I think he's also a great lefty who gets

3898
02:41:46,251 --> 02:41:47,110
that a lot.
Yeah.

3899
02:41:47,740 --> 02:41:48,610
Yeah.
um,

3900
02:41:48,900 --> 02:41:51,670
that's just.
How does that guy go on?

3901
02:41:51,730 --> 02:41:56,100
Like is he just in hiding,
getting his restaurants?

3902
02:41:56,590 --> 02:41:58,660
Like sneaking in,
like where?

3903
02:41:58,840 --> 02:42:01,870
Where does he get glasses?
How does he get around?

3904
02:42:01,900 --> 02:42:06,900
Yeah.
I don'T know who wants to get his money 

3905
02:42:06,900 --> 02:42:06,900
from?

3906
02:42:06,900 --> 02:42:06,900
He's got pay for food.
Right?

3907
02:42:06,900 --> 02:42:06,900
What does he do for food?
Yeah,

3908
02:42:06,900 --> 02:42:08,950
a lot of borscht.
Fuck,

3909
02:42:09,910 --> 02:42:12,070
I just looked them up.
Google is like kind of broken.

3910
02:42:12,280 --> 02:42:14,710
here's an example of it.
It says when did he die?

3911
02:42:14,770 --> 02:42:17,500
And then it just highlights a date and 
it doesn't say he's not dead.

3912
02:42:18,920 --> 02:42:23,380
So snowden flew to Hong Kong where he 
was staying.

3913
02:42:23,620 --> 02:42:25,150
No,
but that was part of his whole trip.

3914
02:42:25,151 --> 02:42:27,760
He had to go through this whole journey 
through a bunch of countries.

3915
02:42:27,820 --> 02:42:29,920
Yeah,
that's weird.

3916
02:42:30,220 --> 02:42:32,530
I think they tapped her to Thailand or 
something at some point.

3917
02:42:32,590 --> 02:42:33,890
It is weird.
It's like,

3918
02:42:34,830 --> 02:42:36,970
is that guy just.
That's him forever.

3919
02:42:37,050 --> 02:42:38,680
That's what he does.
Who?

3920
02:42:38,681 --> 02:42:39,380
Snowden.
Yeah,

3921
02:42:39,400 --> 02:42:41,640
I mean he just has to hide.
I,

3922
02:42:41,680 --> 02:42:44,080
I think so.
Or maybe he safe and Russia and putin is

3923
02:42:44,081 --> 02:42:46,420
having him there as a fuck you to us.
Yeah.

3924
02:42:46,421 --> 02:42:49,600
I mean it must have something to do with
the putin's deciding to do this.

3925
02:42:49,810 --> 02:42:51,550
Putting wouldn't do it unless there's 
some advantage to him.

3926
02:42:52,650 --> 02:42:55,840
It's just,
it's just strange.

3927
02:42:56,900 --> 02:43:01,900
Strange.
These things are just these floating 

3928
02:43:01,900 --> 02:43:05,650
like a den,
a little chapters.

3929
02:43:06,070 --> 02:43:08,340
So these stories,
they're just,

3930
02:43:10,010 --> 02:43:10,970
you know,
we all know about it,

3931
02:43:10,990 --> 02:43:12,820
but they don't get resolved well,
right.

3932
02:43:12,821 --> 02:43:13,270
There's a.
Yeah,

3933
02:43:13,330 --> 02:43:13,800
yeah,
yeah,

3934
02:43:13,860 --> 02:43:15,030
yeah,
yeah.

3935
02:43:15,060 --> 02:43:17,030
they're just floating and it's just 
thinking.

3936
02:43:17,040 --> 02:43:22,040
I mean this is why I talk about North 
Korea all the time since I've been 

3937
02:43:22,040 --> 02:43:22,040
there.
Everyone's still there.

3938
02:43:22,040 --> 02:43:23,260
Everyone I met and like think about six 
years.

3939
02:43:23,320 --> 02:43:24,790
[inaudible] has been in that one 
building,

3940
02:43:24,930 --> 02:43:29,930
six fucking.
It's so and all the people in jail also 

3941
02:43:29,930 --> 02:43:29,930
who had been jailed for 60 years.
Just a.

3942
02:43:29,930 --> 02:43:32,590
We can't wrap our heads around that six 
fucking year.

3943
02:43:32,591 --> 02:43:33,870
thinking about where you were six years 
ago,

3944
02:43:33,880 --> 02:43:35,650
I'm thinking of where I was six years.
Not just that,

3945
02:43:35,651 --> 02:43:38,650
like six years and things are 
deteriorating.

3946
02:43:39,010 --> 02:43:40,840
Right?
They want them out of the embassy.

3947
02:43:40,990 --> 02:43:43,090
He's got nowhere to go.
If he leaves,

3948
02:43:43,091 --> 02:43:45,160
he gets arrested.
He doesn't have any internet.

3949
02:43:45,670 --> 02:43:48,520
Yeah.
Can't see sunlight knowing that the most

3950
02:43:48,521 --> 02:43:53,521
powerful people in the world were doing 
everything they can to fucking put you 

3951
02:43:53,521 --> 02:43:54,250
in jail for life and you kind of already
are in a sense.

3952
02:43:57,430 --> 02:44:00,520
I can't see julian assange is never in 
the rest of his life.

3953
02:44:00,550 --> 02:44:03,550
Probably going to be able to like take a
jog around the park like ever.

3954
02:44:03,880 --> 02:44:04,630
No,
never.

3955
02:44:04,690 --> 02:44:05,590
We're like,
walk a dog.

3956
02:44:06,730 --> 02:44:07,780
Yeah,
it's over.

3957
02:44:08,290 --> 02:44:13,290
It's,
it's scary and the thing is a lot of 

3958
02:44:13,290 --> 02:44:16,441
this shit that he.
Almost all the shit that he put out his 

3959
02:44:16,441 --> 02:44:16,441
true.
That's what's crazy.

3960
02:44:16,441 --> 02:44:19,690
it's like he's doing what journalists 
should be doing instead of getting up in

3961
02:44:19,691 --> 02:44:22,380
the press core and just pitching a fit.
Yeah,

3962
02:44:22,390 --> 02:44:27,390
but it is.
There's real repercussions for doing 

3963
02:44:27,390 --> 02:44:30,631
what he did and that's what they're 
letting us know and they're letting us 

3964
02:44:30,631 --> 02:44:31,780
morning matter what the law is like,
what are you getting them for?

3965
02:44:31,781 --> 02:44:36,781
Secret sex or a surprise like what right
is running his twitter account.

3966
02:44:38,980 --> 02:44:41,410
He's the president of something called 
freedom of press,

3967
02:44:41,411 --> 02:44:45,640
which is a website and twitter account 
also have the same name and they tweeted

3968
02:44:45,641 --> 02:44:47,170
this out a couple of days ago.

3969
02:44:47,430 --> 02:44:52,430
Jet story I'd never heard of.
It says in the latest case in the trump 

3970
02:44:52,430 --> 02:44:53,410
administration's cracked down on leaks.
Natalie edwards,

3971
02:44:53,411 --> 02:44:58,411
us treasury employee was arrested and 
charged with giving suspicious bank 

3972
02:44:58,411 --> 02:44:59,560
records involving trump campaign 
associates,

3973
02:44:59,561 --> 02:45:04,390
paul manafort and rick gates to a news 
outlet in the legal complaint,

3974
02:45:04,870 --> 02:45:08,500
the justice department said word for 
word conversations he allegedly had with

3975
02:45:08,501 --> 02:45:11,710
the reporter over an encrypted messaging
app.

3976
02:45:12,430 --> 02:45:17,430
the government claimed it got ahold of 
her phone and with it her encrypted 

3977
02:45:17,561 --> 02:45:21,430
messages with a reporter.
Now she faces prison time.

3978
02:45:21,790 --> 02:45:23,600
Wow,
dude.

3979
02:45:24,570 --> 02:45:28,870
I'll report it should be using apps that
make all their messages disappear,

3980
02:45:29,140 --> 02:45:30,320
like signaling.
What's that?

3981
02:45:30,410 --> 02:45:32,440
Yeah,
that's what you use this website?

3982
02:45:33,460 --> 02:45:38,460
Yeah,
but even then someone can take 

3983
02:45:38,460 --> 02:45:38,460
screenshots.
No,

3984
02:45:38,460 --> 02:45:38,620
I Think something that you can't.
It's disabled automatically.

3985
02:45:38,770 --> 02:45:39,480
Really?
Yeah.

3986
02:45:39,490 --> 02:45:41,500
But you can take a picture of your phone
with another phone obviously.

3987
02:45:41,501 --> 02:45:43,370
But signal.
Yeah.

3988
02:45:43,600 --> 02:45:46,660
My friend who knows more than anything.
I know that interest security.

3989
02:45:46,661 --> 02:45:50,830
He use signal signal and secure drop.
And so what is signal?

3990
02:45:50,831 --> 02:45:52,690
What do you do with signal?
Basically it's.

3991
02:45:52,691 --> 02:45:54,970
It's encrypted.
So if you send messages to me,

3992
02:45:54,971 --> 02:45:59,971
like you could set it to vanish at a 
certain time and I can't do a 

3993
02:45:59,971 --> 02:45:59,971
screenshot.
Oh,

3994
02:45:59,971 --> 02:46:00,730
interesting.
Yeah.

3995
02:46:01,230 --> 02:46:03,150
Hm.
And it's.

3996
02:46:03,170 --> 02:46:04,810
It's not hackable.
Apparently.

3997
02:46:04,811 --> 02:46:06,400
it's the best one.
It's the,

3998
02:46:06,990 --> 02:46:08,230
it's the better version of whatsapp.

3999
02:46:10,700 --> 02:46:13,220
What else?
Michael will have to discuss.

4000
02:46:13,550 --> 02:46:16,700
We can talk about we exactly already 
3:00.

4001
02:46:16,960 --> 02:46:18,730
We can talk about my book when it comes 
out that's coming on here.

4002
02:46:18,731 --> 02:46:20,000
When is your book?
May 14th.

4003
02:46:20,030 --> 02:46:20,870
What's it called?
The new.

4004
02:46:20,871 --> 02:46:21,890
Right?
The new.

4005
02:46:21,891 --> 02:46:22,790
Right.
Then you right.

4006
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:23,770
What's the new,
right.

4007
02:46:24,020 --> 02:46:26,600
Then you write a nice way of saying 
outright,

4008
02:46:27,010 --> 02:46:28,220
they're included in that.
Yeah,

4009
02:46:28,221 --> 02:46:31,910
I was charlottesville and I interviewed 
some nazi store it.

4010
02:46:32,650 --> 02:46:35,120
What was that like?
A interesting.

4011
02:46:35,210 --> 02:46:36,900
How stupid were they?
Uh,

4012
02:46:37,240 --> 02:46:38,040
now,
not.

4013
02:46:38,090 --> 02:46:41,630
That's the big myth that these people 
are affected because they're bright.

4014
02:46:41,870 --> 02:46:46,870
It's like any 90 percent what the nazis 
iN charlottesville or bright.

4015
02:46:47,310 --> 02:46:52,310
Then in a hold on any population,
you can have 90 percent and it's 10 

4016
02:46:52,310 --> 02:46:54,941
percent.
So there are people in that group who 

4017
02:46:54,941 --> 02:46:54,941
are sophisticated.
This is whY they're getting traction.

4018
02:46:54,941 --> 02:46:56,270
You can just a kid but fucked up.

4019
02:46:56,600 --> 02:46:57,800
Correct.
Okay.

4020
02:46:58,730 --> 02:47:02,100
So evil geniuses,
uh,

4021
02:47:02,150 --> 02:47:04,060
I like to refer to myself as an evil 
genius.

4022
02:47:04,070 --> 02:47:06,350
I don't know that I want to be lumped in
with that term,

4023
02:47:06,680 --> 02:47:07,580
but yeah,
I mean,

4024
02:47:07,660 --> 02:47:11,030
and I mean they're dangerous in that 
sense.

4025
02:47:12,290 --> 02:47:13,880
They are intelligent,
manipulative,

4026
02:47:13,881 --> 02:47:17,540
and right.
And the thing is right and it's,

4027
02:47:17,690 --> 02:47:20,270
as soon as they start talking,
you see them as human beings.

4028
02:47:20,271 --> 02:47:22,280
It's very hard to dismiss people and 
their ideas.

4029
02:47:22,281 --> 02:47:27,281
And if the press won't talk about those 
ideas and sweep them under the rug and 

4030
02:47:27,281 --> 02:47:27,710
they're saying things you've never heard
before,

4031
02:47:27,950 --> 02:47:29,660
right away,
there's an element of intrigue.

4032
02:47:29,810 --> 02:47:31,580
Well,
the right is such a dirty word now.

4033
02:47:31,640 --> 02:47:33,080
The right.
Like jusT saying,

4034
02:47:33,200 --> 02:47:38,200
it's always been a dirty word,
but was way dirtier now than it's ever 

4035
02:47:38,200 --> 02:47:38,200
been before.
No,

4036
02:47:38,200 --> 02:47:38,200
no,
no.

4037
02:47:38,200 --> 02:47:39,560
In the past it was much worse.
Well,

4038
02:47:39,561 --> 02:47:40,940
maybe in my lifetime I should.

4039
02:47:41,120 --> 02:47:46,120
Yeah,
but I mean that there's a vested 

4040
02:47:46,120 --> 02:47:48,491
interest on the part of the corporate 
press to make it a dirty word because 

4041
02:47:48,491 --> 02:47:48,491
then it's like,
well,

4042
02:47:48,491 --> 02:47:51,791
the all the good people are in the left 
and then you don't have to do any 

4043
02:47:51,791 --> 02:47:54,280
persuading.
Do you think that that's a strategy or 

4044
02:47:54,280 --> 02:47:57,281
do you think that's really what evidence
do you have the points to it being a 

4045
02:47:57,281 --> 02:47:58,910
strategy?
Because if you have news articles,

4046
02:47:58,911 --> 02:48:01,690
they will always use the term far right 
as a pejorative.

4047
02:48:01,720 --> 02:48:03,710
They never used the term far left.
It's true.

4048
02:48:03,740 --> 02:48:06,170
It's a complete asymmetry and today for 
sure,

4049
02:48:06,230 --> 02:48:11,230
and different countries,
you'll have all these nationalist 

4050
02:48:11,230 --> 02:48:11,230
movements and they're always referred to
as far right.

4051
02:48:11,230 --> 02:48:15,401
Which is not accurate because they're 
usually moderates when it comes to 

4052
02:48:15,401 --> 02:48:15,401
things like social security or 
government spending.

4053
02:48:15,401 --> 02:48:18,200
They're just on one issue nationalists,
but they're far right.

4054
02:48:18,590 --> 02:48:21,230
so that's a way to kind of lump them in 
with the nazis.

4055
02:48:21,231 --> 02:48:26,231
And in many cases they aren't at all.
A nigel farrage is an example of this 

4056
02:48:26,231 --> 02:48:28,550
hit when he took over ukip and the whole
british,

4057
02:48:28,610 --> 02:48:30,200
uh,
independence movement.

4058
02:48:30,440 --> 02:48:34,020
He fought against the white supremacists
because they wanted to tie together.

4059
02:48:34,021 --> 02:48:34,280
He goes,
no,

4060
02:48:34,281 --> 02:48:34,400
no,
no,

4061
02:48:34,401 --> 02:48:34,560
no,
no,

4062
02:48:34,580 --> 02:48:39,580
that's not what we're about.
And this was one of his big 

4063
02:48:39,580 --> 02:48:41,681
accomplishments and doesn't get ever 
getting credited about this while he's 

4064
02:48:41,681 --> 02:48:43,550
just so inexorably connected to brexit.
Yes.

4065
02:48:44,060 --> 02:48:46,630
All anybody thinks about him as racism,
right?

4066
02:48:46,670 --> 02:48:47,910
That's by intent.
Yeah.

4067
02:48:48,150 --> 02:48:50,410
That's,
it's also just convenience,

4068
02:48:50,411 --> 02:48:55,411
sloppy,
lazy thinking by a lot of people were 

4069
02:48:55,411 --> 02:48:55,411
just too many things to pay attention 
to.

4070
02:48:55,411 --> 02:48:55,890
Right.
YoU kNow,

4071
02:48:55,910 --> 02:48:59,120
and if you just all brexit bad,
racist,

4072
02:48:59,150 --> 02:49:04,150
the definition of a racist is something 
that a progressive doesn't like or 

4073
02:49:04,150 --> 02:49:05,690
someone who's racist or someone is 
racist.

4074
02:49:05,691 --> 02:49:07,840
So they're using these two things 
interchAngeably,

4075
02:49:08,010 --> 02:49:09,600
but it's a problem.
That's the problem.

4076
02:49:09,670 --> 02:49:09,780
You can,

4077
02:49:10,300 --> 02:49:15,300
I remember when all used to be,
all used to be like nerds.

4078
02:49:15,910 --> 02:49:19,850
he used to be all left.
He used to be like alternative music,

4079
02:49:19,910 --> 02:49:21,800
all comedy,
all this.

4080
02:49:22,220 --> 02:49:24,590
But like sonic youth.
People don't say that anymore.

4081
02:49:24,780 --> 02:49:27,530
Like even in comedy,
they don't use the term alt rooms,

4082
02:49:27,590 --> 02:49:29,660
but all comedy was a thing.
Yes.

4083
02:49:29,900 --> 02:49:32,700
But now people stopped using it because 
outright.

4084
02:49:32,810 --> 02:49:35,190
Yeah,
they just used the ucb like,

4085
02:49:35,270 --> 02:49:36,320
oh,
we're going to ucb.

4086
02:49:36,330 --> 02:49:40,040
They don't say I'm going to these rooms,
but sometimes people do refer,

4087
02:49:40,041 --> 02:49:45,041
like it's sometimes there's like a 
little bit of residual leftover or some 

4088
02:49:46,030 --> 02:49:48,130
comics will still use that word.
But alt.

4089
02:49:48,410 --> 02:49:49,400
If someone said,
oh,

4090
02:49:49,401 --> 02:49:52,940
he's alt,
you would automatically assume they were

4091
02:49:52,941 --> 02:49:57,020
like really low key left wing 
progressive.

4092
02:49:57,160 --> 02:50:02,160
that was alt.
Now all is all right where it's like 

4093
02:50:02,160 --> 02:50:04,700
racist nazi,
you know,

4094
02:50:04,701 --> 02:50:05,510
milo.

4095
02:50:05,570 --> 02:50:10,570
Well the npc script is right.
Like if a person is to the right of 

4096
02:50:10,570 --> 02:50:11,720
hillary clinton,
then execute.

4097
02:50:11,721 --> 02:50:16,721
All right.
did ecc and I'm just giving you the 

4098
02:50:16,721 --> 02:50:16,721
whole speech.
Yeah.

4099
02:50:16,721 --> 02:50:16,721
So it's,
it's,

4100
02:50:16,721 --> 02:50:17,540
uh,
it's,

4101
02:50:17,650 --> 02:50:21,140
I mean the discourse in this country has
completely collapsed and I love it.

4102
02:50:21,650 --> 02:50:26,650
Why do you love It though?
This course is because my rights are up 

4103
02:50:26,650 --> 02:50:26,650
for discussion,
let alone a vote.

4104
02:50:26,650 --> 02:50:29,870
So whenever people sit down and have a 
talk about my life and freedom,

4105
02:50:29,871 --> 02:50:34,871
it's going to end badly for me.
So if people can't talk to each other 

4106
02:50:34,871 --> 02:50:37,871
about this,
maybe we'll go our separate ways and 

4107
02:50:37,871 --> 02:50:39,371
live peacefully.
So you'd raTher not talk about it and 

4108
02:50:39,371 --> 02:50:39,410
just go peacefully.
So what you're saying,

4109
02:50:39,590 --> 02:50:44,590
someone's political opinions and 
preferences should have as much impact 

4110
02:50:44,590 --> 02:50:46,760
in my life as their sexual preferences.
You want to fuck dudes.

4111
02:50:46,761 --> 02:50:48,350
You want to have a threesome?
I don't.

4112
02:50:48,351 --> 02:50:53,351
I care if you're my friend and that I'm 
interested but it's not going to impact 

4113
02:50:53,351 --> 02:50:53,510
me and it shouldn't impact me.
And same thing with,

4114
02:50:53,650 --> 02:50:56,750
oh You want more?
Well for grade go live your life.

4115
02:50:56,751 --> 02:51:00,480
That was sort of it becoming some 
shouting match on your front door and,

4116
02:51:00,500 --> 02:51:02,060
and uh,
yeah.

4117
02:51:02,090 --> 02:51:05,240
instead of you and your buddies coming 
up and scaring the shit out of my kids.

4118
02:51:05,390 --> 02:51:07,190
Yeah,
I mean no one.

4119
02:51:07,250 --> 02:51:09,470
I mean very few people deserve that.
I was going to say no one,

4120
02:51:09,471 --> 02:51:11,180
but very few people deserve that.
Yeah,

4121
02:51:11,230 --> 02:51:16,230
so disengaging from political discourse 
as a strategy for just overall civility,

4122
02:51:18,580 --> 02:51:23,580
but also worsening political discourse 
and a purpose to make it so that people 

4123
02:51:23,580 --> 02:51:24,550
can't actually form coalitions and get 
anything done.

4124
02:51:24,760 --> 02:51:29,010
But it is amazing how personal people 
take other people's opinions on things.

4125
02:51:29,080 --> 02:51:31,600
Crazy.
People get,

4126
02:51:31,870 --> 02:51:33,670
you know what it is like when you're 
dating and you think,

4127
02:51:33,671 --> 02:51:33,970
oh,
this,

4128
02:51:34,030 --> 02:51:35,740
this girl likes the same kind of music I
do,

4129
02:51:35,741 --> 02:51:40,741
so we're going to get along.
That is a very weak correlation and 

4130
02:51:40,741 --> 02:51:44,161
there's lots of people who are right 
wing who are good people and there's 

4131
02:51:44,161 --> 02:51:48,241
lots of people who are left wing who are
good people and there's lots of people 

4132
02:51:48,241 --> 02:51:51,661
who are right wing who are bad people.
There's a very weak correlation between 

4133
02:51:51,661 --> 02:51:51,661
this.
Uh,

4134
02:51:51,661 --> 02:51:56,191
it's a cultural signifier.
You probably came from the same culture 

4135
02:51:56,191 --> 02:51:56,191
because people just take the culture of 
what they grew up with.

4136
02:51:56,191 --> 02:51:58,750
But if you're going to just dismiss it,
it's higher schools of thought.

4137
02:51:58,751 --> 02:52:02,800
Just because they vote dIfferently from 
you is as a personal level that's you're

4138
02:52:02,801 --> 02:52:04,510
missing out.
A lot of quality people.

4139
02:52:04,990 --> 02:52:05,830
I couldn't agree more.

4140
02:52:06,070 --> 02:52:08,260
We should probably end it with that.
Tell me about your book.

4141
02:52:08,261 --> 02:52:09,220
When's it out?
May,

4142
02:52:09,310 --> 02:52:10,710
May 14th,
29.

4143
02:52:11,080 --> 02:52:12,120
Well,
that's a long time from now.

4144
02:52:12,190 --> 02:52:14,250
Come back on again when it comes out.
Yeah,

4145
02:52:14,380 --> 02:52:15,160
I love it.
I love you.

4146
02:52:15,190 --> 02:52:17,230
I love you buddy.
Thank you.

4147
02:52:17,430 --> 02:52:18,250
Alright,
bye everybody.

4148
02:52:23,890 --> 02:52:27,330
The.
