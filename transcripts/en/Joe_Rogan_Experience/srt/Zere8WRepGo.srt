1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,600
Five,
four,

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,030
three,
two,

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:06,810
one.

4
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:08,210
Hello,
Dr.

5
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:13,300
so high,
tap it and pull this sucker from your 

6
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:13,300
face.
There you go.

7
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:14,000
Yeah.
Perfect.

8
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:15,620
Thanks for doing this.
Appreciate it.

9
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:17,600
Thank you for having me.
Uh,

10
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:20,990
I've watched a bunch of your videos,
have listened to a bunch of your talks,

11
00:00:20,991 --> 00:00:23,840
read a bunch of your work.
Very interesting person.

12
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:26,150
And this is a good time for a person 
like you.

13
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:28,820
Things seem to be kind of scrambled a 
little bit.

14
00:00:28,821 --> 00:00:33,821
Yeah.
A little topsy turvy out there these 

15
00:00:33,821 --> 00:00:33,821
days.
A little bit crazy.

16
00:00:33,821 --> 00:00:36,230
So you're a sex neuroscientist,
is that an accurate description?

17
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,290
I'm a former

18
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:39,180
academic sex researcher,
uh,

19
00:00:39,181 --> 00:00:44,181
my Phd's in sexual neuroscience research
and now I work as a science journalist 

20
00:00:44,181 --> 00:00:44,350
and a columnist.

21
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:45,820
And why former

22
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,970
because the climate and academia has 
changed so much,

23
00:00:50,971 --> 00:00:52,800
like you mentioned how things are topsy 
turvy,

24
00:00:52,801 --> 00:00:55,290
but that's pretty much how you can 
describe academia nowadays.

25
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:56,490
Even in the hard sciences.

26
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,730
Yeah.
It's um,

27
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,710
it's getting a little weird.
What do you attribute it to?

28
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:08,230
I think it's a combination of things.
I think it's a particular ideologies 

29
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:09,980
coming in and taking over,
but they've been there for awhile,

30
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:12,710
but I think it's at that they've reached
the mainstream.

31
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:18,220
I see it as political correctness 
running a mock and I see it as 

32
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:22,841
legitimate researchers not being able to
speak out because they've got enough on 

33
00:01:22,841 --> 00:01:25,910
their plate with their research,
their teaching.

34
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:27,350
They've got their students,
you know,

35
00:01:27,351 --> 00:01:30,470
they're super busy and then on top of it
they don't want to deal with the mobbing

36
00:01:30,471 --> 00:01:32,570
that will inevitably happen if they do 
speak out.

37
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,600
So things are kind of in favor right now
of the craziness.

38
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:39,490
But it's fascinating though as an 
outsider to watch the craziness.

39
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:44,790
I bet.
I mean I'm glad I don't have to be in 

40
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,660
school right now and deal with it,
but to watch it from the outside,

41
00:01:46,661 --> 00:01:48,460
it's just so interesting.
Interesting.

42
00:01:48,461 --> 00:01:49,570
In what way though?
Well,

43
00:01:49,571 --> 00:01:54,571
because it's almost like there's a sort 
of a delusional aspect to it,

44
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:56,660
like a,
a,

45
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:59,400
an agreed upon delusional aspect.
It's like,

46
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:04,430
like the gender one in particular,
that gender is very strange right now.

47
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,290
Like,
um,

48
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:10,660
there's a,
there's first of all the Lbgtq.

49
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:14,220
I a what else?
Et cetera.

50
00:02:14,221 --> 00:02:17,490
Is there,
and they're adding more to it.

51
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,440
They keep adding more yet to be more 
inclusive.

52
00:02:19,441 --> 00:02:20,130
Okay.
Jamie,

53
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:20,850
something going on.

54
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,470
Focus is fucked up.
Oh,

55
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,480
what's going on?
I got it.

56
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:24,880
All right.

57
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:27,870
I thought maybe we were down again.
Um,

58
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,140
yeah,
it just.

59
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:34,350
But gender in particular.
One of the things I said about one of 

60
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:38,671
the more bizarre things about today's 
political climate is that people 

61
00:02:38,831 --> 00:02:43,831
selectively agree with science.
It's like when it comes to client 

62
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:46,870
climate change,
like everybody is like pro science,

63
00:02:46,871 --> 00:02:48,970
like science all the way.
Look at the studies.

64
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,160
Even when they don't even understand the
studies.

65
00:02:51,161 --> 00:02:56,161
Like there's a famous and you know,
I get in trouble when you bring up 

66
00:02:56,161 --> 00:02:57,850
Tucker Carlson because people go,
oh,

67
00:02:57,851 --> 00:02:59,910
you're a target Carlson fan.
I'm

68
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:02,240
just as a human being,
I'm not going to make.

69
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:05,590
He made some very good points with Bill 
Nye.

70
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:10,860
He had bill Nye on.
They were talking about science and he 

71
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:10,860
said,
okay,

72
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:11,440
if human beings are responsible for 
climate change,

73
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,620
what percentage?
What are the numbers like?

74
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:18,760
Bill Nye really isn't a scientist.
He's a science.

75
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:21,340
You know?
What would your personality,

76
00:03:21,341 --> 00:03:24,010
those immediate personality,
he's a guy who's a,

77
00:03:24,011 --> 00:03:26,290
you know,
he's a promoter of science,

78
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:29,170
but not really necessarily scientist,
so he's.

79
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,200
He doesn't,
he doesn't have long term study and 

80
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,360
research to climate change.
He's just sort of on there in a slightly

81
00:03:37,361 --> 00:03:40,300
arrogant way saying things that I agree 
with.

82
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,120
What I agree with is that human beings 
are responsible,

83
00:03:43,121 --> 00:03:46,210
at least in part with climate change.
This is what all the research points to,

84
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,760
but when Tucker Carlson was pressing him
on it,

85
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,260
he really didn't have any answers for 
it,

86
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:55,740
so it's one of those things where like 
people on the left will blindly support 

87
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,180
science in one way.
Is that you or me?

88
00:03:57,181 --> 00:03:58,000
Dang it.
If it's me,

89
00:03:58,001 --> 00:04:00,300
I'm going to be very upset with myself.
I don't think it's me,

90
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:07,120
but then when it comes to gender,
you watch his show.

91
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:09,770
He's got this wacky show on Netflix 
where they're.

92
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:13,720
They're singing songs about gender can 
be fluid and gender could be.

93
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:15,430
This is more than two.
Yeah.

94
00:04:15,431 --> 00:04:18,160
There's more than two genders,
which he didn't use to say.

95
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:19,720
If you go back to one of his old.

96
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:24,810
I did see that there was another episode
where they clearly say that gender is 

97
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:24,810
binary.

98
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:29,170
Yeah.
This was like way back before all this 

99
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:31,121
nuttiness staff,
so it's influencing people who are in 

100
00:04:31,121 --> 00:04:35,760
the people are deciding instead of 
supporting science and supporting the 

101
00:04:36,141 --> 00:04:40,940
research on actual human beings as a 
biological organism.

102
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:46,370
Instead we're going with this bizarre 
politically correct climate which 

103
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:51,311
inclines people to this weird delusional
thinking and as an outsider,

104
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,590
that's what's interesting to me to watch
all this scrambling,

105
00:04:54,591 --> 00:04:56,660
look at this weirdness.
You know,

106
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,480
it's hypocritical.
It definitely is.

107
00:04:58,481 --> 00:05:01,330
And it's interesting to see.
I mean say the March for Science,

108
00:05:01,331 --> 00:05:03,640
I attended that not this past year but 
the year before.

109
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,310
So people are there.
They're super excited about science,

110
00:05:06,311 --> 00:05:07,900
pro science.
I think science is great.

111
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,750
All this money should go into science 
and you ask them,

112
00:05:10,751 --> 00:05:11,380
okay,
so you're.

113
00:05:11,381 --> 00:05:14,080
So you're down for climate change being 
real,

114
00:05:14,081 --> 00:05:19,081
but what about science?
Now by the left and I asked so many 

115
00:05:19,081 --> 00:05:19,600
people this while I was there because I 
was reporting on it for playboy.com

116
00:05:19,601 --> 00:05:22,780
and it's amazing.
People get very uncomfortable.

117
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:27,810
They don't want to.
They don't want to say anything about I 

118
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:30,181
would consider myself to be a liberal,
but definitely liberals don't want to 

119
00:05:30,181 --> 00:05:32,671
think about themselves being science 
deniers and when you look at how people 

120
00:05:32,671 --> 00:05:35,110
talk about gender now and biological sex
differences in the brain,

121
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:39,160
even biology more generally,
people get very defensive.

122
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:41,860
They get angry almost,
and if they find it threatening for some

123
00:05:41,861 --> 00:05:43,360
reason,
which I don't understand,

124
00:05:43,361 --> 00:05:45,190
and that's a big part of my work is to 
say,

125
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:50,240
I think we can acknowledge that these 
facts exist and that biological sciences

126
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:53,530
legitimate.
That doesn't mean that sexism is okay.

127
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:55,930
We're not saying that women are inferior
or anything like that.

128
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,580
Exactly.
That's the big point about all this,

129
00:05:58,581 --> 00:06:03,581
right,
is that we're not saying that anyone's 

130
00:06:03,581 --> 00:06:04,460
inferior,
but we're just not the same thing.

131
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:08,360
This is what the big problem is to try 
to say,

132
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,380
uh,
I mean,

133
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:14,400
I,
I certainly think we should all have 

134
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,701
equal rights,
but we're not equal in terms of what we 

135
00:06:15,701 --> 00:06:15,701
are.
We're a different we're.

136
00:06:15,701 --> 00:06:17,210
And it's not that we're not equal,
like one's better.

137
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:21,980
It's just like saying a wolf is not 
equal to achieve their fucking different

138
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:26,960
things and males and females are 
different things and this is,

139
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,800
this is clear when you study us as an 
organism,

140
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:33,410
you know,
I had a really bizarre conversation once

141
00:06:33,411 --> 00:06:38,411
with a guy who's a professor or a former
professor and he was trying to deny that

142
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:42,610
there there's a difference between men 
and women and one of the things I said,

143
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:43,250
I said,
okay,

144
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,360
you get a dog.

145
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:47,630
Do you ask,
is this a boy dog or a girl dog?

146
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:50,840
And then he got real weird,
but this is really no answer to that.

147
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,810
Like it's a fucking boy dog.
You want a boy dog,

148
00:06:53,811 --> 00:06:56,450
right?
Is it a nonbinary dog?

149
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,520
Like what is your dog?
It might change.

150
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:01,970
It's fine to Milo your dog gender fluid.
Like what is gender fluid?

151
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:07,120
Well,
it's this idea that you can be one 

152
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,551
gender one day and another gentleman the
other day or it might cycle through the 

153
00:07:09,551 --> 00:07:12,851
day or doesn't your mix of both.
That seems like if it was anything else,

154
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:15,920
you would have to be fucking crazy.
Right?

155
00:07:15,921 --> 00:07:20,921
It was.
Anything else you feel like if you 

156
00:07:20,921 --> 00:07:20,921
decided,
well today I'm African,

157
00:07:20,921 --> 00:07:21,490
tomorrow I'm Chinese,
you know,

158
00:07:21,491 --> 00:07:23,690
oh,
today I'm tall tomorrow.

159
00:07:23,691 --> 00:07:25,580
I'm short today.
I'm a Pixie tomorrow,

160
00:07:25,581 --> 00:07:28,310
but what else like that?
I think everybody is.

161
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,960
We don't have to call it something like 
gender fluid.

162
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:34,990
Everyone is a mix of male and female.
Have people that are maybe more 

163
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:37,160
typically masculine and feminine,
but even still there,

164
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:42,730
I don't think there are many people that
are 100 percent one way or the other 

165
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:42,730
not.
Well,

166
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:43,730
what does that even mean?
I mean,

167
00:07:43,731 --> 00:07:47,570
people are clearly more masculine than 
other people,

168
00:07:47,571 --> 00:07:49,480
but does that mean that the people like,
you know,

169
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,020
let's pick a person,
Bill Nye.

170
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:53,450
Does that mean he's not a man?
He's clearly a man.

171
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,570
He's clearly a man.
He's not a Lebron James,

172
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,580
but he's a man.
You know,

173
00:07:58,581 --> 00:07:59,090
there's,
there's,

174
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,120
there's obviously a spectrum,
but I almost feel like that way of 

175
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,211
thinking is more old fashioned because 
this is all about being progressive and 

176
00:08:07,211 --> 00:08:07,910
open minded,
but I think if someone is a man,

177
00:08:07,911 --> 00:08:12,911
but it's maybe more female typical to 
say that this person has a different 

178
00:08:12,911 --> 00:08:15,500
category of gender or that they're not 
mail,

179
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,450
to me that's more stereotypical.

180
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:22,570
You know what I mean?
I think it's not progressive to say if 

181
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:22,570
you're a mix of both,
you must be something different.

182
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:24,650
Well,
you're not necessarily a mix of both,

183
00:08:24,651 --> 00:08:29,651
right?
You just have a different hormonal 

184
00:08:29,651 --> 00:08:30,260
profile are different.
It's a different body types.

185
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:33,950
Different.
I mean people vary so much that.

186
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:38,780
I mean I think having some sort of 
categories to say,

187
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:41,510
oh,
this is a male and this is a female.

188
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:46,540
It seems like pretty beneficial.
I mean although we vary so widely inside

189
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:52,661
those categories to pretend that those 
categories don't exist just seems so 

190
00:08:52,661 --> 00:08:56,651
weird.
We would never do that with any other 

191
00:08:56,651 --> 00:08:56,651
organism and it's a lot work to.
You see

192
00:08:56,651 --> 00:09:01,130
these companies going in,
they're trying to be more and with the 

193
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:02,040
times I guess are there.
Everything is gender neutral now and I'm

194
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:07,041
thinking all of that money and time is 
being wasted when I don't think that 

195
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:08,370
does anything for,
for women or sexism.

196
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:12,480
If you changed instead of addressing 
someone by ladies and gentlemen,

197
00:09:12,481 --> 00:09:15,720
you say people.
Is that really gonna stop sexism.

198
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,510
It just makes people mad because then 
they have to change the way they talk.

199
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:23,630
I put a story on twitter the other day 
about people that are raising their kids

200
00:09:23,631 --> 00:09:24,520
with them.

201
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,340
I saw that.
Yeah,

202
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,250
calling them babies instead of babies.
Oftentimes.

203
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,760
What the fuck is that like her?
Just.

204
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:37,570
I think it's coming from.
For some parents that's coming from a 

205
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:40,361
good place,
like they obviously want the best for 

206
00:09:40,361 --> 00:09:42,071
their kids and they don't want to limit 
the kid in terms of what they might be 

207
00:09:42,071 --> 00:09:46,061
interested and I think because the media
is telling them if you let girls play 

208
00:09:46,061 --> 00:09:46,910
with dolls,
that's terrible and they're going to end

209
00:09:46,911 --> 00:09:47,600
up,
you know,

210
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:52,190
not having any sort of prospects when 
they grow up in terms of their jobs or I

211
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:53,660
don't know,
it's such a terrible thing to be female.

212
00:09:53,661 --> 00:09:58,661
Typical nowadays,
but I mean like you mentioned is 

213
00:09:58,661 --> 00:10:01,631
biology.
That's going to dictate what your kids 

214
00:10:01,631 --> 00:10:03,311
play with.
And then in other cases I think it's 

215
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:03,311
parents that want to be special.

216
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:06,470
Well,
it's also weird because if your son is 

217
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:08,190
trans,
it's totally fine for him to be female.

218
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:13,191
Typical like it's celebrated.
Like if you have a trans son and he 

219
00:10:13,191 --> 00:10:17,361
likes wearing lipstick and short skirts 
and prints and around then he's 

220
00:10:17,361 --> 00:10:21,591
fabulous.
Like there was a boy in New York and 

221
00:10:21,591 --> 00:10:25,641
there was this whole thing about he's 
the youngest ever drag queen and and 

222
00:10:25,641 --> 00:10:26,370
everybody's going crazy and people were 
angry about it,

223
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,200
you know?
Yeah.

224
00:10:28,201 --> 00:10:33,201
Some people were angry and saying he was
being exploited by his parents and some 

225
00:10:33,201 --> 00:10:37,431
people thought it was wonderful that 
this kid was so expressive when he's so 

226
00:10:37,431 --> 00:10:37,750
young,
and then other people say,

227
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,940
I had a good point.
They said,

228
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:41,190
well,
it's very sexualized.

229
00:10:41,191 --> 00:10:46,191
Like how is this any different than 
someone who's in a beauty pageant like 

230
00:10:46,191 --> 00:10:47,570
Jon Benet Ramsey type situation when 
were really young.

231
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:52,650
If it was a little girl,
people would be up in arms sexist and 

232
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:54,010
that it's the patriarchy,
but that little boy,

233
00:10:54,011 --> 00:10:57,660
so I don't know that he's trans.
I believe that he just likes to like,

234
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:00,460
like a man who's a drag queen is just a 
man.

235
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:03,220
It's usually gay men who likes to,
you know,

236
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:06,040
like an extreme form of femininity.
I love drag Queens,

237
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:09,400
but I think that little boy is likely 
going to grow up to be a gay boy.

238
00:11:09,401 --> 00:11:14,401
If you have a little boy who says he's a
girl and you see a lot of these trans 

239
00:11:14,401 --> 00:11:17,641
girls,
if they were left alone and they didn't 

240
00:11:17,641 --> 00:11:20,371
transition,
they would likely research shows they 

241
00:11:20,371 --> 00:11:20,470
would grow up to be gay men is.

242
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,240
Yeah.
I mean,

243
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:25,570
I'm 100 percent for freedom,
right,

244
00:11:25,571 --> 00:11:27,880
so I'm 100 percent for you being able to
do whatever you want to do.

245
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:32,890
The real question becomes when people 
are Trans and young,

246
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:38,400
it's a how much,
how much of this is going to pass and 

247
00:11:39,611 --> 00:11:44,611
how much of this are you going to stop 
from ever passing because you're going 

248
00:11:44,611 --> 00:11:45,190
to inject your body filled with 
hormones,

249
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:50,460
like are you giving yourself the 
opportunity just to decide to become a 

250
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,530
gay man versus become a woman?
Would you be happier either or.

251
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,690
It's very,
very tricky,

252
00:11:55,850 --> 00:12:00,850
but you can't even have that 
conversation because that's considered 

253
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:01,790
transphobic.
What it is is homophobic though that you

254
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:04,610
can consider that some of these kids 
just might be gay children.

255
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:05,600
Yeah,

256
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,000
but then the.
The gender fluid one.

257
00:12:08,001 --> 00:12:13,001
I was reading this article about this 
guy who varies by the day and like in 

258
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:16,790
the day like he'll have periods of 
stress will switch over to a woman.

259
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:21,380
There was actually a radiolab podcast 
where they interviewed a person that has

260
00:12:21,381 --> 00:12:26,381
the same issue and the person was 
clearly abnormal in the way they 

261
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:32,831
communicated and the way they thought.
It wasn't like you were dealing with 

262
00:12:32,831 --> 00:12:33,950
some guy that you would trust with your 
taxes.

263
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:39,190
You know what I mean?
It was like the dude was wacky and then 

264
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:42,041
now he's a check and now he's back to 
being a guy and so he actually 

265
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:45,641
transitioned in mid conversation,
like physically I didn't see it because 

266
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,990
it's just listening.
Okay,

267
00:12:47,991 --> 00:12:49,220
okay.
But he's like,

268
00:12:49,221 --> 00:12:50,180
well,
now I'm Peter again.

269
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:50,900
Oh,
I see what you mean.

270
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:54,170
Not Wendy.
Hi Wendy.

271
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:54,940
Well,
it's.

272
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,280
I don't know how much of that is 
indulgent.

273
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:59,320
I mean,
I don't want.

274
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:03,800
I don't want to say I know how you feel,
but I do want to say,

275
00:13:03,801 --> 00:13:05,900
hey,
are you fucking crazy?

276
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,340
Is this,
are we just.

277
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:09,800
Are we just indulging crazy people and 
how to be.

278
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,620
I do believe there are people that are 
trans.

279
00:13:12,621 --> 00:13:17,621
I absolutely believe that there are 
women that really are wired the wrong 

280
00:13:17,781 --> 00:13:20,240
way and they should be men and there's 
men that are wired the wrong.

281
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:22,460
It only makes sense.
It only makes sense.

282
00:13:22,461 --> 00:13:27,461
Yeah,
but I do also think there's people that 

283
00:13:27,461 --> 00:13:31,031
are crazy.
There's people that have legit mental 

284
00:13:31,031 --> 00:13:34,160
illness,
they're delusional and they're also very

285
00:13:34,161 --> 00:13:37,670
susceptible to influence and very 
susceptible to,

286
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:42,790
you know,
someone persuading them that they are 

287
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:42,790
one thing or another thing.
Look,

288
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:48,280
it's those like heaven's gate cult 
people who cut their balls off and wore 

289
00:13:48,951 --> 00:13:53,951
the Nike's and decided to kill 
themselves when the comment was near 

290
00:13:53,951 --> 00:13:54,470
number that yeah,
that's not normal.

291
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:59,860
It's not normal for someone to be able 
to talk to you any cutting your balls 

292
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,730
off or putting on the purple sneakers or
killing yourself when the comments close

293
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:06,940
because there's a spaceship waiting.
It's going to take you to Xenu or 

294
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:06,940
wherever the fuck you going.
Right.

295
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:10,871
That's not normal either.
So we know that people are subject to 

296
00:14:10,871 --> 00:14:14,501
very irrational behavior under the 
influence of other people's suggestions 

297
00:14:14,501 --> 00:14:14,720
or other people's,
you know,

298
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:15,850
persuasion.
Yeah,

299
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:19,010
definitely.
And this is a thing today where you have

300
00:14:19,011 --> 00:14:23,120
to wonder like how many of these people 
are legitimately trans,

301
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:28,150
how many of these people are 
legitimately dealing with like a real 

302
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:31,961
mental issue that's causing them to 
shift from male to female and back 

303
00:14:31,961 --> 00:14:35,921
again?
And why is it that we can't ask these 

304
00:14:35,921 --> 00:14:37,790
questions because why is it that even 
this question right now,

305
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:42,791
I could be accused of being transphobic 
for asking how many of these people are 

306
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:42,890
ill?

307
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,090
Yeah.
Well both of us were going to be accused

308
00:14:45,091 --> 00:14:46,740
of transphobia after this.
Yeah,

309
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,180
I mean,
I would agree with that.

310
00:14:48,181 --> 00:14:53,181
I do think that gender dysphoria is a 
phenomenon and I do have a lot of 

311
00:14:53,511 --> 00:14:55,700
empathy for people who are suffering.
And I think for adults,

312
00:14:55,701 --> 00:14:58,850
they should be allowed to transition if 
that's what they decide to do,

313
00:14:58,851 --> 00:15:00,620
if that's something that will help them 
feel better.

314
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,540
My issues with the kids,
uh,

315
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:07,560
it's,
I don't think it's appropriate for 

316
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:07,560
children to be transitioning.
And I can talk a bit more about why,

317
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,930
but I think in terms of the pathology 
aspect,

318
00:15:08,931 --> 00:15:11,960
I think for,
because gender is so trendy right now,

319
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:17,230
and in the past you might have seen this
kind of pathology manifests in a 

320
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:21,521
different way,
but now because everyone is saying is 

321
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:21,521
the way to express,
you know,

322
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:23,480
I think people also see a fever problem 
in your life.

323
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:28,960
They think it's gender related,
so say with some of the personality 

324
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,360
disorder and people like a lot of 
attention,

325
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:31,280
they like to,
um,

326
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:36,700
it's always about them and their 
identity and their identity shifts a 

327
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,551
lot.
So this could very well be what it is 

328
00:15:39,551 --> 00:15:39,551
and now they're being basically rewarded
for that.

329
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:40,540
Yeah,
that's the issue,

330
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:45,541
right?
That you're dealing with incredibly 

331
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:48,091
indulgent people which do exist and they
then they find this pathway to massive 

332
00:15:48,091 --> 00:15:49,850
amounts of attention.
You know what I mean?

333
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:50,500
This is,
I,

334
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:54,970
I had to construct a bit to mock Caitlyn
Jenner,

335
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:59,290
but it was a very complicated bit like I
had to figure out how to do this.

336
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:02,230
I was like,
obviously this is nonsense and foolish,

337
00:16:02,231 --> 00:16:04,930
but I don't want to appear cruel,
so what is the way to do this?

338
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:10,170
So my way was to mock myself mercilessly
and which is kind of true.

339
00:16:10,361 --> 00:16:15,361
Like I really do have three daughters 
and I really do get brutalized in my 

340
00:16:15,361 --> 00:16:16,090
house.
Like I really do think they chip away at

341
00:16:16,091 --> 00:16:17,530
my note.
It's kind of a joke,

342
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:21,130
but I mean it really is.
It's all girly in my house.

343
00:16:21,131 --> 00:16:23,500
My fucking house is so girly.
Everyone's girly.

344
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,020
They're always talking about girly shit.
It's kind of hilarious.

345
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:30,610
But the joke was that if my manhood was 
a mountain of marbles,

346
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:35,670
every day they take two marbles,
they just take one like you don't even 

347
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:35,980
need these,
these,

348
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:37,450
what do you care?
God.

349
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:40,720
And then that I'm not going to go out 
like Bruce Jenner,

350
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:45,980
that one the one day that they.
So I had to concoct this whole thing 

351
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:50,851
that they were demons,
which is how they conjured up all that 

352
00:16:50,851 --> 00:16:53,341
money.
Like how else would they have hundreds 

353
00:16:53,341 --> 00:16:53,341
of millions of dollars through no 
discernible reason.

354
00:16:53,341 --> 00:16:55,900
There's no,
there's no way you could like explain to

355
00:16:55,901 --> 00:16:59,200
someone how they made so much money if 
they didn't understand our culture.

356
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,790
It's totally irrational.
Right?

357
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:06,030
So the idea was that that they did this,
but why did it was I wanted to sort of 

358
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:11,110
mock this thing that was happening where
you've got a male Kardashians.

359
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:14,680
That's what he does.
And who doesn't believe in gay marriage?

360
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,090
Who decides he's a woman,
which I firmly believe he's trans.

361
00:17:19,091 --> 00:17:24,091
I'm not denying that at all,
but our obsession with it and rewarding 

362
00:17:24,521 --> 00:17:29,521
him with ungodly amounts of attention.
This motherfucker won the gold medal in 

363
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:33,040
the decathlon.
Was it?

364
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:34,630
The calphalon was right?
Yeah.

365
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:39,830
I mean he was on the cover wheaties.
I mean he was a fucking us superstar 

366
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:43,450
athlete and then no attention after 
that,

367
00:17:43,451 --> 00:17:46,600
he was the whipping boy of the 
Kardashians on their TV show.

368
00:17:46,601 --> 00:17:48,070
They mocked him.
It was like,

369
00:17:48,071 --> 00:17:50,900
here's this one with fucking talent.
Your don't.

370
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:55,910
They mock rob a bit fat,
but then they go right to that.

371
00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:00,570
He becomes a woman and now he is the 
toast of the town.

372
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:05,870
He wins woman of the fucking year.
He's a woman for six months and he wins 

373
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:08,580
woman of the year.
He Wins Espn athlete of the year.

374
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:12,510
He has been an athlete in fucking 
decades since Nixon was president,

375
00:18:12,511 --> 00:18:13,740
right?
Or Carter,

376
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:15,360
who was it?
Either way,

377
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:20,520
this is madness.
This is where we're not treating this in

378
00:18:20,521 --> 00:18:25,521
a balanced way where we are rewarding 
people that instead of like,

379
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,200
because people are so,
they're,

380
00:18:28,201 --> 00:18:28,710
they're,
they're,

381
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:34,580
they're so ready to proclaim the 
progressiveness and so excited about it 

382
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:40,820
that they instead of like,
instead of treating them as an equal,

383
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:46,880
they go completely the other way.
So there are definitely not prejudice.

384
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:50,490
They're definitely not discriminating 
against them,

385
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:55,820
but they're absolutely inflating what 
this person is and,

386
00:18:56,271 --> 00:18:59,610
and they're making it a big giant deal 
that they're trans.

387
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:04,790
Like it's great to support people.
I would like to live in a world where 

388
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:07,260
there's no racism at all,
so you could mock everyone equally.

389
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:11,100
Like,
this is my big problem with real racism.

390
00:19:11,101 --> 00:19:15,750
There's a lot of dummies in every race,
but you gotta be real careful picking on

391
00:19:15,751 --> 00:19:18,690
some dummies,
like specially if you're a white male,

392
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:21,450
straight,
white male oppressor.

393
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,230
You guys are the devil nowadays,
especially if you look like me.

394
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:27,510
I mean I looked like the devil,
so this is a.

395
00:19:27,511 --> 00:19:32,511
This is a real problem with like looking
at things in a balanced perspective 

396
00:19:32,511 --> 00:19:34,770
because you're not allowed to not 
allowed.

397
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:37,890
Like even what you said earlier,
you said gender dysphoria,

398
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,780
you know,
that's considered transphobic.

399
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:45,210
Yeah.
You can't even say that anymore even 

400
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:46,711
though that is a legitimate medical 
condition because some people see it as 

401
00:19:47,171 --> 00:19:51,070
you pathologizing being the way someone 
feels,

402
00:19:51,071 --> 00:19:56,071
I guess,
but in my mind I don't think the issue 

403
00:19:56,071 --> 00:19:56,071
is pathology.
The pathology,

404
00:19:56,071 --> 00:19:56,740
I think it's fine to acknowledge there 
are certain things like any,

405
00:19:57,010 --> 00:20:00,580
any medical condition that causes you 
distress and impairment.

406
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:03,490
That's the definition of a psychiatric 
diagnosis,

407
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,190
so you should be able to recognize that 
it's not a bad thing.

408
00:20:06,191 --> 00:20:11,191
I think the bad thing is the stigma that
comes along with having a mental 

409
00:20:11,191 --> 00:20:11,560
disorder,
so that's what should be fought.

410
00:20:11,561 --> 00:20:14,770
It's the stigma aspect,
not calling something a mental disorder.

411
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:16,810
If someone's.
If someone's really suffering,

412
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,100
that's not a good thing.

413
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,000
No,
no.

414
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:24,010
It's not a good thing.
And also the denial of these conditions 

415
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:25,100
and the denial of the science behind 
these conditions.

416
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:30,400
This is the issue with progressive 
people today is that there's certain 

417
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,000
things where they embrace science and 
certain things where they deny it and in

418
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:38,010
gender,
gender in particular seems to be so 

419
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:39,050
hotly contested and I don't know when 
this happened,

420
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:41,480
it seems to have happened right in front
of our face.

421
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:43,430
Like it,
it just came out of the ground,

422
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:46,280
like a plant that was growing in the 
crack

423
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,940
now to let try to stomp it out and it 
won't go away.

424
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,280
I'm wondering,
I'm wondering where the shit.

425
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:57,040
Like I didn't see this coming and it's,
it's fascinating to see.

426
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:02,590
I think feminism is part of it.
The mainstream aspect of this really far

427
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:04,900
left feminism.
I used to call myself a feminist.

428
00:21:04,901 --> 00:21:09,901
I don't anymore just because the things 
that people used to say feminism stood 

429
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:12,010
for like hating men being a.
I don't know,

430
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,230
just don't say that.
Well,

431
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,260
some of them do.
They say they hate men.

432
00:21:17,261 --> 00:21:22,261
Oh yeah.
I have friends who say my male friends 

433
00:21:22,261 --> 00:21:22,261
who say to me,
you know,

434
00:21:22,261 --> 00:21:22,261
my female friends said the men are 
trash.

435
00:21:22,261 --> 00:21:23,620
Is that normal?
Well,

436
00:21:23,621 --> 00:21:26,410
there's a woman that I know that's a 
feminist that has on her,

437
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,180
uh,
her twitter account.

438
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,500
It says,
trust.

439
00:21:29,501 --> 00:21:34,501
No Man,
like just openly proclaiming that if 

440
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:35,380
you're straight,
good luck.

441
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,350
Good luck with your life.
You're saying trust.

442
00:21:38,351 --> 00:21:40,800
No Man.
But imagine if you said about women,

443
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:41,980
you know,
terrible thing.

444
00:21:41,981 --> 00:21:42,580
Yeah,
that would be,

445
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:47,080
that'd be awful as well.
But it's acceptable to hate on men now.

446
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:48,970
Well,
nobody criticizes misandry,

447
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:50,170
you know,
it's just,

448
00:21:50,171 --> 00:21:52,780
it's not something that is,
that gets brought up.

449
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:54,610
I don't even,
I've never even said that worked before.

450
00:21:54,611 --> 00:21:57,430
I've only written it and set it or 
written it and heard it.

451
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,380
I mean,
I get it.

452
00:21:59,381 --> 00:22:04,381
I do.
I think feminism at the core had some 

453
00:22:04,381 --> 00:22:06,721
good aspects in the beginning,
but it's just gone off the rails more 

454
00:22:06,721 --> 00:22:07,870
recently.
Equality has great aspects,

455
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:13,500
but I think the problem with any like 
white power is obviously awful.

456
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,810
You say white power.
Well you're,

457
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:21,850
you're.
What you mean is your racist against 

458
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:21,850
other races.
You're into white people,

459
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:23,140
but brown powers.
Okay.

460
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:24,550
Brown prides.

461
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:25,990
Okay.
Right.

462
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,670
Nowadays they see it that way.
Yeah.

463
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:31,060
Male pride is not okay.
Not Okay,

464
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:34,080
but girl pride is fine.
Girl power is okay.

465
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:37,210
Yeah.
It's fucking weird because you're.

466
00:22:37,211 --> 00:22:39,250
You're,
you're generalizing.

467
00:22:39,251 --> 00:22:42,730
You're lumping yourself into a group of 
people just because you all have vaginas

468
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:48,020
and we don't all think the same,
but the minute you as a woman say 

469
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:50,410
something that goes against girl power,
they will descend on you.

470
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,060
Yes.
I've seen that too.

471
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:57,120
Well,
it's like you're threatening the 

472
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,150
collective agreed upon narrative and you
are.

473
00:22:58,151 --> 00:23:01,420
It's like you like the way girls treat 
sluts.

474
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:07,020
Girls get very mad if a girl just 
decides to have sex as many people as 

475
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:12,110
she wants because then you're fucking up
this whole economy of controlling the 

476
00:23:12,701 --> 00:23:16,490
narrative of when women decide to or 
not.

477
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,770
Sex goes down that way too.
Which is why prostitution's illegal.

478
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,210
I see both sides.

479
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:23,440
I see some women,
which I.

480
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:28,680
which I find interesting because I think
it's confusing for young women now who 

481
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,710
are starting to date and they think I 
don't really want to have casual sex,

482
00:23:29,711 --> 00:23:31,450
but I'm being told that's what I should 
do.

483
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,790
Is that what they're being told?
I think so.

484
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:38,850
I think by whom?
By the media more like it's empowering 

485
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:39,910
to go out and sleep with as many people 
as you want and to be like a man,

486
00:23:39,911 --> 00:23:44,911
like if you look at college campuses and
how there's quite a bit of casual sex 

487
00:23:44,911 --> 00:23:46,040
going on and I don't think that's

488
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,930
for everyone.
I think from an evolutionary perspective

489
00:23:47,931 --> 00:23:52,931
to women don't like that as much.
I was talking to a friend of mine today 

490
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:53,920
about this,
uh,

491
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:59,130
who's in the military and he was saying 
what's crazy about certain branches of 

492
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:03,281
the military is you have like 100 men to
one women to one woman and one woman,

493
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:11,020
especially if they're deployed and this,
they have the pick of the litter and 

494
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:15,041
they'll just fuck her gang of dudes.
Same time I would never talked about.

495
00:24:15,381 --> 00:24:17,000
I've never thought about it that way 
before,

496
00:24:17,001 --> 00:24:18,300
but he was like,
you know,

497
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:23,320
well everybody just sort of agrees that 
nobody has this one girl that nobody is 

498
00:24:24,081 --> 00:24:28,640
going to own her and that she can have 
sex with as many guys as she wants to.

499
00:24:28,641 --> 00:24:30,730
Like the,
what he was saying is like,

500
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:35,770
at least in his experience that the 
whole dynamic of male female 

501
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:39,611
relationships shift and these girls can 
basically date as many of these guys 

502
00:24:40,291 --> 00:24:41,060
that she wants.

503
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,880
It was kind of interesting and they 
don't shame her for that.

504
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,400
Well,
they can't because there's only one.

505
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:49,260
It's like they don't want her to get 
angry at them too.

506
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:51,050
It's like I didn't talk to them about it
a lot.

507
00:24:51,051 --> 00:24:52,850
We always spoke about it for like 10 
minutes,

508
00:24:52,851 --> 00:24:54,740
but it was like this.
That's kind of crazy.

509
00:24:54,741 --> 00:24:56,990
I never even thought about that dynamic 
like that.

510
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:00,530
That sort of a scenario where there's 
100 men in one chick.

511
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,840
That's a lot of men.
That's a lot of men.

512
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:07,930
Good luck with all that.
You can get sore and you'd be like 

513
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:07,930
annoyed,
like really cute.

514
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:10,460
Let me alone and you're going to sleep.
How much time does she have?

515
00:25:10,461 --> 00:25:11,790
You know?
How much time does she have?

516
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:13,910
Yeah,
especially if you're in the military,

517
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,460
you've got tasks,
things you need to do.

518
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:21,800
Yeah,
but it's the dynamics shift according to

519
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:27,160
like what is available and who's there 
and what kind of a culture you live in.

520
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:34,030
People adapt are very malleable to 
different climates and different 

521
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:38,201
cultures and the way people treat sex 
and don't treat sex and this is when I 

522
00:25:38,451 --> 00:25:43,451
think what happens is people tend to 
react very aggressively or very strongly

523
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:50,740
when someone is doing something that is 
different than the way they're doing 

524
00:25:51,051 --> 00:25:56,051
things because this would possibly 
indicate that there's another way or 

525
00:25:56,051 --> 00:25:56,970
maybe their was wrong or maybe it's 
just.

526
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:00,650
And especially when it comes to sex,
people get very strange.

527
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,980
They do like when people find out that 
people are in open relationships.

528
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:09,030
I have a good friend of mine who's in an
open relationship and it's so 

529
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:11,870
fascinating to watch all the people.
You have guys fuck your girlfriend,

530
00:26:11,871 --> 00:26:16,871
Bro.
And he asked to sort of discuss it and 

531
00:26:16,871 --> 00:26:16,871
the gas.
This is,

532
00:26:16,871 --> 00:26:17,570
it's not comfortable for me.
I wish I enjoyed it.

533
00:26:17,571 --> 00:26:22,571
I enjoy it.
So why do they have an open 

534
00:26:22,571 --> 00:26:22,571
relationship?
I don't know.

535
00:26:22,571 --> 00:26:22,571
I mean they have to talk to them about 
it.

536
00:26:22,571 --> 00:26:24,170
I mean he's got bunch of different 
answers.

537
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:29,590
I think the main answer is he wants to 
fuck other people and she wants to fuck 

538
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:31,850
other people and so they just decided to
do it that way and they were together in

539
00:26:31,851 --> 00:26:34,070
a monogamous relationship for for 
awhile,

540
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:39,130
but I think I am correct.
I think they've been in an open 

541
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:41,580
relationship longer than they were in a 
monogamous relationship with a for.

542
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:43,260
I would have to ask him I think

543
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:46,740
more than a year,
maybe two years or something like that.

544
00:26:46,741 --> 00:26:48,600
And then it's been like four years of 
open.

545
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:52,260
Open relationships are actually pretty 
common.

546
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:57,560
Consensual nonmonogamous.
There's one study that showed one in 

547
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:57,560
five Americans have actually tried it,
so it's pretty common.

548
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,220
Me Personally,
I'm monogamous,

549
00:26:59,221 --> 00:27:01,710
but I think people should do what they 
want to do.

550
00:27:01,711 --> 00:27:06,711
If it's consensual.
I think obviously having been a sex 

551
00:27:06,711 --> 00:27:07,470
researcher and now someone who writes 
about sex research for a living,

552
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:12,800
I'm very sex positive and I think a lot 
of the problems that we see in a lot of 

553
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:16,110
the suffering and distress and issues 
that people have in their lives could be

554
00:27:16,111 --> 00:27:19,140
solved.
If our world was more sex positive,

555
00:27:19,141 --> 00:27:21,000
we could just talk about sex like 
anything else,

556
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:26,260
right?
The shame of it is the real problem and 

557
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:29,721
this is what I'm saying with that people
when you're living a life that's 

558
00:27:29,721 --> 00:27:30,840
different than the way they're living 
their life,

559
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:31,710
they.

560
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,380
People get very aggressive about it.
Same Way.

561
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:39,680
I mean sober.
People tend to get aggressive about 

562
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:43,581
people enjoy drinking or people enjoy 
smoking pot or taking mushrooms or 

563
00:27:43,581 --> 00:27:47,811
something.
They get very shitty about it sometimes 

564
00:27:47,811 --> 00:27:48,480
and it's because it's very polar,
very,

565
00:27:48,481 --> 00:27:53,481
very opposite of the way they're living 
their life and they don't want to see 

566
00:27:53,481 --> 00:27:54,000
anybody living their life in a very 
different way,

567
00:27:54,001 --> 00:27:55,530
but also being happy.
They think,

568
00:27:55,531 --> 00:28:00,531
well,
this is not how I do it and this is 

569
00:28:00,531 --> 00:28:02,900
contrary to my values,
so you must be doing something wrong or 

570
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:02,950
you need alcohol to get by.
Is that what you need?

571
00:28:02,951 --> 00:28:03,900
You need to like,
oh,

572
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:06,250
you don't need that drink.
I don't want it.

573
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:08,330
I just have it.
If I have a glass of wine,

574
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:10,980
I get happy.
Who's getting hurt here and what?

575
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:15,981
You're going to start doing heroin.
Then you're going to wind up in the 

576
00:28:15,981 --> 00:28:15,981
gutter.

577
00:28:15,981 --> 00:28:17,460
I've never have never been on heroin,
never been in the gutter,

578
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,200
been alive for a while.
Nothing's happened.

579
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,180
Can be a bit of projection too.
For sure.

580
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,810
Someone who's dealt with substance 
issues that the fear that you know,

581
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:28,170
it's very easy for someone else to fall 
down the same hole.

582
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:31,680
Right,
but it's this thing that people living a

583
00:28:31,681 --> 00:28:35,120
different way is somehow or another 
threatening,

584
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:39,080
unacceptable and threatening to their 
perceptions of what,

585
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,870
what you should be doing with your life.
Yeah.

586
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,250
Yeah,
and I think,

587
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:47,730
I mean this is very unrelated to the 
hole,

588
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,840
but it's not.
It's what,

589
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:55,040
when it comes to gender,
I think there's just this thing that 

590
00:28:55,111 --> 00:29:00,111
people,
people want things to be more easily 

591
00:29:00,111 --> 00:29:02,040
explained than they are.
That's true.

592
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:04,740
I could see that because it takes a lot 
of work to actually go.

593
00:29:04,741 --> 00:29:06,960
So people who say that gender is a 
social construct,

594
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:08,130
that's a good one.

595
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,110
Sounds very nice.
I love saying that.

596
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:15,220
It's not saying that,
but it's infuriating because it's 

597
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:19,070
everywhere now.
Like this is what children are being 

598
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:21,111
taught in school up in Canada.
That's what they're being taught in 

599
00:29:21,111 --> 00:29:22,200
their curriculum.
And there's absolutely no truth to it at

600
00:29:22,201 --> 00:29:27,201
all.
But I mean if you read the scientific 

601
00:29:27,201 --> 00:29:29,990
studies,
you cannot come away from them saying 

602
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:34,100
gender's a social construct.
There's the argument for it if you were 

603
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,370
arguing for it that uh,
I guess the,

604
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:40,050
the idea is that women should be equal.
And obviously as a woman,

605
00:29:40,051 --> 00:29:42,100
I believe that.
And so

606
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:46,600
any sort of subjugation of women must 
somehow be imposed by society because if

607
00:29:46,601 --> 00:29:51,601
we acknowledged that women are different
biologically in any way that's going to 

608
00:29:51,601 --> 00:29:54,220
be used as justification why they don't 
deserve to be treated the same as men or

609
00:29:54,221 --> 00:29:56,110
they're not as capable as men,
but yes,

610
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,630
different subjugation and why is 
different incapable?

611
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,600
Why is different

612
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:04,610
in fairness?
Because there has been a history of 

613
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:06,650
there being sexism and say.
So with the whole Google memo thing and 

614
00:30:06,691 --> 00:30:10,320
this idea that women are biologically,
we are different.

615
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:15,350
Not to say we're not as capable,
but if there are any sort of biological 

616
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:15,990
correlates to what women find 
interesting,

617
00:30:15,991 --> 00:30:20,991
could that be extrapolated to capability
extrapolated to women should go back to 

618
00:30:21,121 --> 00:30:23,010
the kitchen.
The women aren't good at math,

619
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:28,040
things like that.
I mean I get why people don't like 

620
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,520
biological explanations for things I 
didn't.

621
00:30:29,521 --> 00:30:34,521
Like you said,
I think it's just a lot easier and it's 

622
00:30:34,521 --> 00:30:34,521
a lazy way to just dismiss the whole 
thing and say,

623
00:30:34,521 --> 00:30:35,190
you know,
we don't need to think about it.

624
00:30:35,191 --> 00:30:36,120
Nothing to see here.

625
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,080
Yeah.
Nothing to see here.

626
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:43,230
But it just,
it's clearly not true in terms of the 

627
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:47,011
scientific research,
so there has to be some cognitive 

628
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:50,860
dissonance in order to accept that and 
to preach it and to say it and everybody

629
00:30:50,861 --> 00:30:55,861
has to agree upon it,
which is one of the reasons why I think 

630
00:30:55,861 --> 00:30:59,310
any,
any statements contrary to that get 

631
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:03,070
aggressively attack.
And this is part of the reason why these

632
00:31:03,071 --> 00:31:06,840
ideas are so supercharged.
It's that there's,

633
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:11,900
there's a,
there's an understanding that it's 

634
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:14,510
horseshit.
And so when someone challenges it and 

635
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:17,581
says it's Horseshit,
you've been living your whole life with 

636
00:31:17,581 --> 00:31:17,581
this horseshit.
It's almost like a religious thing.

637
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:18,520
Yeah.
Well,

638
00:31:18,521 --> 00:31:23,521
okay.
I think some people know what the truth 

639
00:31:23,521 --> 00:31:25,501
is and they actively lie because they 
think they're doing something good for 

640
00:31:25,501 --> 00:31:28,921
women.
So they'll say gender is a social 

641
00:31:28,921 --> 00:31:28,921
construct even though they know it's 
biological.

642
00:31:28,921 --> 00:31:31,150
And I think people who are younger may 
be going through school.

643
00:31:31,151 --> 00:31:36,151
Now we're being taught there's actually 
don't know the difference and actually 

644
00:31:36,151 --> 00:31:36,151
believe it,

645
00:31:36,151 --> 00:31:39,670
but why would they aggressively attack 
the scientific research that's contrary 

646
00:31:41,001 --> 00:31:42,110
to that claim?
Then?

647
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,420
You mean the people who don't know any 
better?

648
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:50,020
They actually believe that gender is a 
social construct and these scientists 

649
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:50,540
are just sexist and misogynistic.
Want to keep women down,

650
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:55,640
but I.
I can get that if you didn't research 

651
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:55,640
it,
if you didn't look into it,

652
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:55,650
but once you start looking into it,
you go,

653
00:31:55,651 --> 00:31:56,730
oh,
well this is weird,

654
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,960
but there's clearly.

655
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,600
Do you think people actually look into 
it though?

656
00:32:01,601 --> 00:32:04,210
I don't think they do.
The sense I get is they.

657
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:09,230
They find someone or some journalists 
who has had some sort of decent sounding

658
00:32:09,281 --> 00:32:14,281
criticism of the literature and they 
just pair it that I don't think they 

659
00:32:14,281 --> 00:32:14,281
actually go and look at the studies.

660
00:32:14,281 --> 00:32:15,280
Well,
I think there's part of.

661
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:20,310
There's definitely something to that and
I think there's something to this 

662
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:21,820
problem that human beings have where 
they.

663
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:27,020
They have an idea and that idea becomes 
a part of their identity and then they 

664
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:31,351
start arguing for that idea and any 
argument against that idea is an 

665
00:32:31,351 --> 00:32:34,810
argument against them as a person 
because they're trying to win.

666
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:39,230
They're not necessarily looking at 
things in an objective way where they're

667
00:32:39,231 --> 00:32:40,130
detached

668
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:42,710
from the idea and studying it as a 
thing.

669
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:48,190
Instead they're arguing to try to win.
I think that is a giant problem with 

670
00:32:48,471 --> 00:32:53,471
ideas and in yes,
and it becomes even more of a problem 

671
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:57,290
when it gets tribal.
When these ideas are attached,

672
00:32:57,590 --> 00:33:02,590
like climate change,
clearly attached in denial to the right 

673
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:07,150
in support to the left.
It's this very strange tribal thing and 

674
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:12,850
that also happens with gender and it 
also like if you are in support of of 

675
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:17,681
women's rights and you are in support of
trans rights and Lbgtq and all that 

676
00:33:17,691 --> 00:33:20,360
jazz,
you're almost 100 percent going to be on

677
00:33:20,361 --> 00:33:23,300
the left.
It's just one of those tribal things.

678
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:28,420
If you're pro choice,
you're almost always going to be on the 

679
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:28,420
left.
If you're not,

680
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,360
you find yourself in that.
Which one was.

681
00:33:29,361 --> 00:33:31,730
It was a Tammy Lauren.
I get her confused with that.

682
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:36,730
Lauren southern girls.
Those girls are interchangeable in some 

683
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:37,210
strange way.
Those the,

684
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:40,430
the hot Republicans and Tomi Lahren,
Tomi Lahren,

685
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:42,920
she's pro choice.
She got attacked.

686
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:45,710
Can Be can be.
You want to be on this team,

687
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,990
you want to be on the main white girl 
team.

688
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:51,890
You can't be project you gotTa,
you gotta be prolife.

689
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:54,940
What about life?
What about the baby's support debate?

690
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:59,980
We,
you know what I'm saying was like some 

691
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,721
ideas get locked into ideologies.
They get locked into these tribal 

692
00:34:01,721 --> 00:34:06,311
ideologies and gender is most certainly 
one of those because people don't want 

693
00:34:06,311 --> 00:34:08,810
to be without a political home.
Right?

694
00:34:08,811 --> 00:34:11,510
That's a very good way of putting it 
because if you do say,

695
00:34:11,511 --> 00:34:15,230
say someone like Tommy Tommy who is,
why do I call it Tammy?

696
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:19,460
Because I'm an asshole.
She in trouble.

697
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:23,870
Tomi Lahren will star in pro life film 
after the break.

698
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:26,390
The blaze fired her for being pro 
choice.

699
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:31,280
What if you're a pro choice conservative
or if you're a pro biology liberal,

700
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,020
you know,
you kind of find yourself in a weird.

701
00:34:33,021 --> 00:34:38,021
In between.
So she's just fucking going the other 

702
00:34:38,021 --> 00:34:38,021
way.
She's going the other way.

703
00:34:38,021 --> 00:34:39,950
She's gonna start a film.
What's a pro life film?

704
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:44,530
So ABC after school special.
Don't have an abortion.

705
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:45,230
Have your baby.

706
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:49,790
Yeah,
it's weird.

707
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Well,
she's got to get our ground back to 

708
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,071
kicked off the team a little bit.
It's a bio pic on the Roe vs Wade case 

709
00:34:57,071 --> 00:34:57,200
starting Stacey Dash.
Oh,

710
00:34:57,350 --> 00:35:02,350
so,
so maybe she's playing a bad person in 

711
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,710
that movie.
Made it even more interesting.

712
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:12,160
Strange.
I wonder how many of those things are 

713
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:12,170
just distractions.
You know,

714
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,470
it's so weird.
People are so weird with their,

715
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,710
their,
their tribal identities.

716
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:20,050
You know,
I,

717
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:25,070
I just,
and I love when they go back and forth 

718
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:26,210
and shift from one side or the other.
I'd love it when like,

719
00:35:26,211 --> 00:35:28,360
wow,
I'm a former conservative scene.

720
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:31,250
The light or you know,
I used to be a liberal to the party.

721
00:35:31,251 --> 00:35:33,140
Lost me.
I love that.

722
00:35:33,141 --> 00:35:36,060
And then they go hardcore on the other 
side is weird because it's ever.

723
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:38,550
Then everything is not just a couple of 
views.

724
00:35:38,551 --> 00:35:42,090
It's everything in alignment with the 
other side to join a church.

725
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,300
Stopped doing drugs.
Yeah,

726
00:35:45,301 --> 00:35:47,370
it's fascinating.
It's fascinating.

727
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:52,620
Um,
as a neuroscientist when something like 

728
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:56,271
the Google memo comes out,
you are also a woman and you are also a 

729
00:35:56,401 --> 00:35:59,940
woman who lost a person of color,
sort of.

730
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:02,130
Are you as I work,
you're lighter than me?

731
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,740
Well,
you're a different color.

732
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:09,610
Am My a person of color telling then I 
have the bolt.

733
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:12,420
You can be an honorary person of color,
I'll give you that bad.

734
00:36:12,421 --> 00:36:17,421
But I'm Sicilian so there's somebody.
My background got fucked by somebody who

735
00:36:18,661 --> 00:36:23,661
was darker for sure,
but I don't know how that works because 

736
00:36:23,661 --> 00:36:28,191
if I was Cuban I would look exactly the 
same and I definitely could be a person 

737
00:36:28,191 --> 00:36:32,551
of color I think is ridiculous.
I can't stand that term for the record 

738
00:36:32,551 --> 00:36:34,110
person of color because those of us who 
are not white,

739
00:36:34,111 --> 00:36:39,111
we don't all think the same,
but we all get lumped in as having some 

740
00:36:39,111 --> 00:36:42,471
sort of a wider conversation with a 
friend of mine about that who was 

741
00:36:42,471 --> 00:36:43,230
Mexican and he was talking about Latinos
and I go,

742
00:36:43,231 --> 00:36:48,231
well you do know that Italian was one of
the original Latin languages,

743
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,220
like I am Latino.

744
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:52,860
If you look at it that way,
like what is Latino?

745
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:55,020
Like you just thinking it was only 
Spanish.

746
00:36:55,021 --> 00:36:58,160
That's not really the technical 
definition of it isn't Latinos?

747
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:59,920
I mean am I correct about that?
I mean,

748
00:36:59,921 --> 00:37:03,720
it doesn't emanate from a Latin language
think so I think so too,

749
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:07,020
but it's just like Italians had been so 
ingrained in our culture.

750
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:09,770
They came over so long ago that like,
you know,

751
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:14,780
my grandparents came here in the 
twenties so that that's a hundred years 

752
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:14,820
ago almost,
so it doesn't count.

753
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:19,980
It doesn't count anymore.
You're not really discriminated against 

754
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:20,370
anymore.
It's like Jews used to be.

755
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:24,270
It's what's interesting is if you follow
boxing history,

756
00:37:24,271 --> 00:37:27,150
and I know you're a martial artist,
you follow boxing history,

757
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:32,630
the oppressed early immigrants are 
almost always the best boxers at the 

758
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:34,920
time and for awhile it was a lot of 
Jewish boxers,

759
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:36,960
a lot of Italian boxers.

760
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:37,590
Of course,
you know,

761
00:37:37,591 --> 00:37:40,640
rocky Graziano and rocky Marciano and 
all these towns,

762
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:45,240
and then it became a Cubans and Puerto 
Ricans and then it became,

763
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:49,830
well there was always blacks as well,
but this like immigrants in particular,

764
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:54,890
Irish,
a lot of Irish immigrants that early on 

765
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:57,680
they were thought of as being some of 
the lowliest of the low and now Irish 

766
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,450
people are 100 percent white,
like no one even thinks about it.

767
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:02,580
Of course they're white,
but I mean they're,

768
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:06,060
they're just American Asian.
Soon we're going to be a hundred percent

769
00:38:06,061 --> 00:38:08,010
white basically.
Well,

770
00:38:08,011 --> 00:38:11,400
not of Harvard has anything to do with.
They're trying to kick you guys out.

771
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,680
What is it about not trying to kick you 
guys out,

772
00:38:13,681 --> 00:38:18,681
but that is one of the weirder 
discriminations that is somehow or 

773
00:38:18,681 --> 00:38:22,071
another slipped under the radar that 
they're making it more difficult for 

774
00:38:22,071 --> 00:38:26,390
Asians to get into Ivy League 
universities because you guys do so 

775
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:26,390
well.
I mean,

776
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:26,390
it,
it,

777
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:29,520
it's racism,
racism,

778
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:32,310
racism,
and I think some of these people who are

779
00:38:32,311 --> 00:38:35,040
getting pats on the back for being 
progressive about being diverse,

780
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:36,130
I think they just don't

781
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:40,060
like us and now they have a politically 
acceptable way to do it.

782
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:42,520
But why is that?
Why would they not like Asians?

783
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,650
Know some people just don't.
Some people are racist,

784
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:48,370
but is it that or is it that you guys do
too?

785
00:38:48,371 --> 00:38:49,030
Well?
Well,

786
00:38:49,031 --> 00:38:49,570
that's the thing.
I mean,

787
00:38:49,571 --> 00:38:51,520
we throw that whole narrative into 
question,

788
00:38:51,521 --> 00:38:54,050
this idea that if you're not white,
you must,

789
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:54,620
uh,
you,

790
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:59,760
you can't be doing well in life.
You can't pull yourself up and get on 

791
00:38:59,760 --> 00:38:59,760
with things.

792
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:04,470
Yeah.
Well that was the argument against the 

793
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:04,470
Charles Murray Book.
What was that book?

794
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:05,380
The bell curve?
Yes.

795
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:10,650
One of the problems with that book is 
people were showing the differences in 

796
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:10,860
ICU,
um,

797
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,100
by,
you know,

798
00:39:12,101 --> 00:39:17,101
as it varies across different 
geographical segments and across races 

799
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:24,240
and if anything,
that book is really a testament to the 

800
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,010
master race of Asians,
but for real,

801
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:28,270
right?
Like Asians,

802
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:33,300
we do okay.
But genetically like Asian people seem 

803
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:36,280
to be superior when it comes to Iq 
according to that book.

804
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,270
I think we just work really hard in our 
culture.

805
00:39:39,271 --> 00:39:41,220
Puts a lot of emphasis on education.

806
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:46,340
Did you read the talent code?
Really interesting book.

807
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:51,720
I'm finishing it up right now,
but one of the things about it is it's 

808
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:52,580
sort of dismisses the idea of talent and
it shows.

809
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:56,420
It goes into depth about all the D,
not dismisses it,

810
00:39:56,421 --> 00:40:00,650
but shows that it's not.
Some magic gift is bestowed upon people,

811
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:05,920
but what it is is it shows all the 
pathways that lead to the skill 

812
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:10,181
developments that we considered talent 
and discipline and hard work in 

813
00:40:10,181 --> 00:40:14,060
particular discipline being a culturally
inforce thing,

814
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:19,360
which it is with many Asians.
I often talk about my friend junk sick 

815
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:23,970
who when I was doing taekwondo,
he was on the US team while he was also 

816
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:29,150
in his residency in medical school.
Sky was I fucking animal.

817
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:34,340
I'd,
I never met anybody in my life who 

818
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:34,340
worked as hard as him.
He always looked exhausted.

819
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:34,800
This is face all the time.

820
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:38,990
I just was always tired,
but then would go to work like a fucking

821
00:40:38,991 --> 00:40:43,550
savage was inbetween studying for his do
you know,

822
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:48,080
in the middle of a medical school and he
would put his backpack on,

823
00:40:48,081 --> 00:40:51,890
filled with books and run the stairs at,
at the university.

824
00:40:51,891 --> 00:40:53,540
He's fucking crazy,
but it's.

825
00:40:53,541 --> 00:40:54,680
This is.
And I would,

826
00:40:54,681 --> 00:40:55,970
I would talk to them about it,
you know,

827
00:40:55,971 --> 00:40:59,180
because my parents were not like that 
and his parents were like,

828
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,300
my parents were hippies and they were 
like,

829
00:41:02,301 --> 00:41:04,190
do whatever the fuck you want.
We don't care,

830
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:06,890
and his parents were like,
you must be a doctor,

831
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:12,280
and he was like telling me about the 
kind of discipline that he grew up with 

832
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:14,450
and that culturally enforced discipline 
leads,

833
00:41:14,451 --> 00:41:15,050
many,
many,

834
00:41:15,051 --> 00:41:15,560
many,
many,

835
00:41:15,561 --> 00:41:18,080
many people to succeed.
Whereas,

836
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:23,370
you know,
the sort of latch key kids that I grew 

837
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:23,690
up with,
there was no.

838
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:25,550
There was no culturally enforced 
discipline.

839
00:41:25,551 --> 00:41:30,551
You either developed it on your own,
you pursued something that you enjoyed 

840
00:41:30,551 --> 00:41:32,950
and figured out how to become discipline
or you just weren't you.

841
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:38,200
But this thing that's in Asian cultures 
is what's propelling them forward.

842
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:44,450
If you subscribe to all the different 
things that are being brought up in this

843
00:41:44,451 --> 00:41:46,400
book,
the talent code and it makes sense.

844
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:47,390
It only makes sense.

845
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:50,140
I think it should be seen as a positive 
thing that you know,

846
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:55,160
everyone is capable.
It's not just a particular race or a 

847
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:55,830
particular group of people that can be 
successful.

848
00:41:56,340 --> 00:42:01,340
I mean,
my issue with the whole thing with the 

849
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,871
Harvard law students that why are Asians
being punished for doing well,

850
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:05,160
essentially explained the lawsuit for 
people that don't.

851
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:10,460
So it turns out that for decades now,
Harvard has been discriminating against 

852
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:14,571
Asians and requiring them to have higher
sat scores than people of other ethnic 

853
00:42:14,941 --> 00:42:17,280
backgrounds in order to get the same 
chance of admission.

854
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:19,740
And then more recently it's been shown 
that,

855
00:42:19,741 --> 00:42:21,990
okay,
so Asians do well with sat scores.

856
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:24,840
They do all the extra curricular 
activities.

857
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:29,190
So the only way that admissions 
committees can actually penalize them is

858
00:42:29,191 --> 00:42:32,820
through writing their personality.
So seeing them as less likable,

859
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:35,560
things like that because they're 
subjective and uh,

860
00:42:35,610 --> 00:42:40,610
you know,
I find it amazing that very few liberal 

861
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:40,610
outlets I've covered this.
Um,

862
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:45,100
the New York Times has been one,
but outside of that it's been very few 

863
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:45,750
and it's really disappointing and no one
has.

864
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:48,840
I mean I wrote about this for the Globe 
and Mail and I was amazed.

865
00:42:48,841 --> 00:42:50,700
No one had heard about this story at 
all.

866
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:52,580
Well,
not only that,

867
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,770
even when I was covering the New York 
Times or burglar.

868
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:56,000
Okay.
Yeah.

869
00:42:56,090 --> 00:42:58,850
Let's go on with our day dawn.
Like in and out.

870
00:42:58,890 --> 00:43:03,890
Yeah.
Whereas if it was in about any other 

871
00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:06,040
subject or any other race or gender,
there's being discriminated against.

872
00:43:06,171 --> 00:43:11,171
I mean if it was discrimination against 
black people in the same systematic way 

873
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:14,180
or systemic way,
it would be outrageous.

874
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:15,530
People go crazy.
Yeah,

875
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:20,770
and even more insane that you're doing 
it to the most successful people.

876
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:26,420
The most successful in terms of 
academics because that's the problem,

877
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:29,110
right?
The problem is helping society either.

878
00:43:29,111 --> 00:43:31,600
I mean if if I were not Asian,
I would be saying the same thing.

879
00:43:31,601 --> 00:43:36,601
I don't think it makes sense to take 
people who are doing well and hold them 

880
00:43:36,601 --> 00:43:36,601
back.
If you,

881
00:43:36,601 --> 00:43:40,981
if you want your society to do well,
I think the solution would be to help 

882
00:43:40,981 --> 00:43:40,981
people.
We're not doing as well.

883
00:43:40,981 --> 00:43:42,250
Don't penalize the people who are doing 
well.

884
00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:45,300
Well,
I think there's a fear of Asians.

885
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:51,390
I'm not bullshitting and one of the.
I've been obsessed with this company 

886
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:55,200
walway recently and what I got obsessed 
with them for two reasons.

887
00:43:55,201 --> 00:44:00,201
One,
because I read an article about the 

888
00:44:00,201 --> 00:44:03,561
superiority of the cell phones that 
they're producing that are not being 

889
00:44:04,171 --> 00:44:08,140
accepted in America,
and so then I started doing.

890
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:11,490
I'm kind of a Dork when it comes to like
cell phones and technology.

891
00:44:11,491 --> 00:44:14,820
I'm very fascinated by them,
so I read a lot of articles about walway

892
00:44:14,821 --> 00:44:19,440
phones and they have these fucking 
insane Leica cameras,

893
00:44:19,441 --> 00:44:24,441
a 40 megapixel lenses,
three lenses on the front and 20 plus 

894
00:44:24,511 --> 00:44:28,920
Megapixel selfie cameras and like really
intense technology.

895
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,690
Much more,
much higher.

896
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:36,420
Like I think they have 500 gigabyte 
storage capacity.

897
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:40,590
Four thousand milliamp batteries.
Like they're superior battery.

898
00:44:40,591 --> 00:44:42,640
It's a superior phone and I'm looking 
at.

899
00:44:42,641 --> 00:44:43,080
I'm like,
wow,

900
00:44:43,081 --> 00:44:43,950
this is kind of crazy.

901
00:44:44,070 --> 00:44:49,070
And then it turns out you can't sell 
them in the United States and the 

902
00:44:49,070 --> 00:44:53,000
federal government's blocked these 
carriers from having them and they're 

903
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:57,291
saying it's because the Chinese 
government is involved in stealing 

904
00:44:57,291 --> 00:45:00,150
information and hacking and all this 
different stuff.

905
00:45:00,151 --> 00:45:00,840
I'm like,
okay,

906
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,150
all right.
Maybe but,

907
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:08,170
but,
but it's kind of fucking weird that you 

908
00:45:08,170 --> 00:45:08,170
can't figure out whether or not a phone 
is being used to like,

909
00:45:08,170 --> 00:45:13,160
how are these hackers,
how these super genius people who 

910
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:16,641
program phones,
you can't look at one of those phones 

911
00:45:16,641 --> 00:45:18,470
and and figure out what it's doing 
because he's doing some magic or,

912
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:23,560
or another.
It's stealing people's information and 

913
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:23,560
there's no mechanism that you can 
detect.

914
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:27,891
What do you think?
There's another reason why they are not 

915
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:29,721
letting them know.
What I'm worried about is that they're 

916
00:45:29,721 --> 00:45:31,590
scared that these companies which are 
fanatical,

917
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:36,980
maniacal in a aggressive pursuit of 
dominance in the cell phone markets and 

918
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:43,400
technology in general are going to take 
over and they're going to squash all 

919
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:43,400
these American companies.

920
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:44,520
And I was like,
how much.

921
00:45:44,521 --> 00:45:47,250
I mean,
this is my own personal speculation,

922
00:45:47,550 --> 00:45:48,450
but I'm looking at this.
I'm like,

923
00:45:48,451 --> 00:45:51,150
how much?
How much legitimacy.

924
00:45:51,151 --> 00:45:54,000
Isn't that because they're right now 
worldwide.

925
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:56,970
I believe that the number three cell 
phone manufacturer,

926
00:45:56,971 --> 00:45:58,980
I think it's Samsung,
apple,

927
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:04,040
and then walk away,
but you can't buy Huawei phones in 

928
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:04,060
America and I'm wondering.
Yeah,

929
00:46:04,810 --> 00:46:09,810
we're scared of the Chinese taking over.
Are you going to try and get one of 

930
00:46:09,810 --> 00:46:10,470
these phones anyway?
I did try to get one,

931
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:13,190
but what I've found out is they're not,
um,

932
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:18,440
they're not set up for the US market.
The GSM phones and I'm on a CDMA 

933
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:20,520
network,
but the GSM phones,

934
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:24,840
they using different bands.
They're not using all the same bands.

935
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:29,100
Like when you buy a phone from China,
even if it's for the UK,

936
00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:31,800
they don't use.
So if you,

937
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:34,200
there's some places we would sacrifice 
coverage.

938
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:39,320
Say if you bought a and if you are a 
cell phone genius out there and you'll 

939
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:39,960
listen to me butcher this.
I'm so sorry,

940
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:42,130
but this is all I got.
What's up?

941
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:47,350
Could you just use it with Wifi only and
not connected to the fuck would you do 

942
00:46:47,350 --> 00:46:50,621
that because you're in the Wifi.
Almost ended up talking about as a 

943
00:46:50,621 --> 00:46:50,621
phone.
I know,

944
00:46:50,621 --> 00:46:50,621
but where's Wifi?
You driving your phone,

945
00:46:50,621 --> 00:46:52,900
your Wifi when you're driving your car.
How are you doing that?

946
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:57,020
Time Warner has wifi all over la if they
have wifi problem with tracking you.

947
00:46:57,021 --> 00:46:58,490
But yeah,
definitely 100 percent.

948
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:00,830
Okay.
So if you're driving in your car,

949
00:47:00,831 --> 00:47:03,650
you could be on Wifi and have your cell 
phone service shut off.

950
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:06,180
Cars also now have them built into their
thing too.

951
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:09,170
There's those are cellular.
Your cellular logic.

952
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,910
It was just a question,
couldn't you also.

953
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:16,180
But that's a cellular Wifi.
So you'd have to have a cellular 

954
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:19,001
account.
So like who would be your cellular 

955
00:47:19,001 --> 00:47:20,831
provider?
Then you're just connecting your phone 

956
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:20,831
to a Wifi thing and you're right,
that's a different thing.

957
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:21,800
BMW or Mercedes,
right?

958
00:47:21,801 --> 00:47:24,380
So whatever that is would be a local 
thing.

959
00:47:25,170 --> 00:47:26,810
You'd have to be right next to your 
fucking car.

960
00:47:26,811 --> 00:47:27,950
You use your phone.
That's stupid.

961
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:33,280
What I'm saying is the problem with the.
This is what our article that I read 

962
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:36,070
does explaining the problem from.
I think it was one of those tech sites,

963
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:39,010
but it was saying that in certain places
with limited coverage,

964
00:47:39,011 --> 00:47:42,040
you probably would have no coverage with
one of these phones.

965
00:47:42,041 --> 00:47:43,450
Whereas it would work.
Okay,

966
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:48,630
if you were in New York or in Los 
Angeles or Chicago or something like 

967
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:50,050
that,
but if you went to the boonies where you

968
00:47:50,051 --> 00:47:51,430
might get,
if you have verizon,

969
00:47:51,431 --> 00:47:54,670
you probably could be able to text your 
friends or get a phone call out,

970
00:47:54,730 --> 00:47:56,380
but you wouldn't be able to do that 
would be a lot harder.

971
00:47:56,381 --> 00:48:01,381
Yeah.
It's just not optimized for our 

972
00:48:01,381 --> 00:48:01,381
networks.
Well,

973
00:48:01,381 --> 00:48:02,770
hopefully it'll change or not.
We're not just keeps quashing them,

974
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:08,340
but I wonder did the problem is I 
believe they think walway is connected 

975
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:11,000
with the communist government.
Yeah.

976
00:48:11,210 --> 00:48:14,260
Yeah.
They're completely integrated,

977
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:16,270
so it's.
I mean,

978
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:19,670
the separation of business and 
government over there is.

979
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:21,280
It's very sketchy,
right?

980
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:24,190
Yeah.
The fuck do I know?

981
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:27,580
I'm just.
I just wonder if there's a fear of Asian

982
00:48:27,581 --> 00:48:30,200
success.
Yeah,

983
00:48:30,201 --> 00:48:32,500
I mean how could that be though?
The Samsung.

984
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:34,330
Samsung is everywhere.

985
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:35,040
They're,
I mean,

986
00:48:35,041 --> 00:48:37,290
they're going to come for everybody,
so they're coming for us right now.

987
00:48:37,291 --> 00:48:38,400
It's only a matter of time.
You know,

988
00:48:38,430 --> 00:48:43,430
who's they?
The people who want equality of outcome 

989
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:43,430
for everyone.
Oh,

990
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:49,250
who are those people?
The people who are really into identity 

991
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:49,250
politics.
Do you think,

992
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:53,810
wow,
I didn't really think that's what was 

993
00:48:53,810 --> 00:48:54,090
holding back Walway I thought it was the
government,

994
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:57,030
the government was worried about them 
getting too much money and power,

995
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,520
but I guess if you're asking me in terms
of my,

996
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:03,270
my view on things and in my experience,
that's where I would take it.

997
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:05,730
So the equality of outcome people,

998
00:49:05,890 --> 00:49:10,890
the reason why they're trying to keep 
Asians or at least limit the number of 

999
00:49:10,890 --> 00:49:14,080
Asians in.
But does that have the opposite effect?

1000
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:16,540
Doesn't that make Asians work even 
harder?

1001
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:21,130
And I mean if you keep them out of 
Harvard,

1002
00:49:21,131 --> 00:49:22,360
they're just going to go to Yale,

1003
00:49:22,690 --> 00:49:25,660
keep Medicare doesn't have numbers like 
that.

1004
00:49:25,661 --> 00:49:30,661
So at Caltech,
there're a lot of Asians there because 

1005
00:49:30,661 --> 00:49:30,661
they don't,
uh,

1006
00:49:30,661 --> 00:49:31,000
they don't discriminate so they just 
dominate.

1007
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:34,310
So you use Caltech as a petri dish?
It can be like a controlled.

1008
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:34,980
Yeah.

1009
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:39,390
Hmm.
But what's wrong with that?

1010
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:41,850
It's like,
but no,

1011
00:49:41,851 --> 00:49:42,180
no,
no.

1012
00:49:42,210 --> 00:49:47,210
The other thing,
like what's wrong with certain cultures 

1013
00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:47,210
dominating?

1014
00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:48,390
I don't think there's anything wrong 
with that.

1015
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:49,110
I think,
well,

1016
00:49:49,111 --> 00:49:53,100
I mean if you're asking me in terms of 
what people see as a problem,

1017
00:49:55,110 --> 00:49:59,790
I think because it looks as though other
groups are not getting a fair chance.

1018
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:02,130
It doesn't make.
It doesn't make people feel good,

1019
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:07,260
right?
Because it means that you're 

1020
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:08,451
acknowledging at some level that some 
people are doing better than other 

1021
00:50:08,451 --> 00:50:08,820
people and that makes some people 
uncomfortable.

1022
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:11,820
Right?
It's the participation trophy world,

1023
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:14,520
the equality of outcome world.
Yeah.

1024
00:50:14,521 --> 00:50:15,720
That's exactly what it is.
Right?

1025
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:19,980
But it's gone to a place where it 
becomes indefensible,

1026
00:50:20,310 --> 00:50:25,310
so instead of raise trying to raise up 
people whose scores are lower and them 

1027
00:50:27,390 --> 00:50:28,160
any an equal

1028
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:33,160
opportunity or take people from 
impoverished areas with poor education 

1029
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:37,360
and give them more of a chance,
which is what affirmative action was 

1030
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:37,360
supposed to be about.
Yeah.

1031
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:39,860
Instead of that,
you're doing it from the top down.

1032
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:42,890
You're going to many of these people 
that are doing good,

1033
00:50:42,891 --> 00:50:45,380
we've got to squash it,
will limit their ability,

1034
00:50:45,650 --> 00:50:48,710
but how could they do that in good 
conscience?

1035
00:50:48,711 --> 00:50:51,350
That's what's crazy,
but did doing it from that perspective,

1036
00:50:51,710 --> 00:50:55,430
doing it like looking at a race that's 
super successful,

1037
00:50:55,431 --> 00:51:00,431
that is also a minority and saying too 
many of them.

1038
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:06,220
Well that's the thing.
I mean I think these people do think 

1039
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:09,761
they're doing something good.
They're doing it for the better of 

1040
00:51:09,761 --> 00:51:11,420
society and for these other groups.
I like to see it too.

1041
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:13,400
Have you ever talked to someone about 
it?

1042
00:51:13,401 --> 00:51:15,470
That's pro discrimination against 
Asians?

1043
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:20,540
I have,
after I wrote that column for the Globe 

1044
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:22,720
and Mail and number of people came out 
of the woodwork to tell me how wrong I 

1045
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:25,211
was and there was some white,
some Asians do well to say don't let 

1046
00:51:26,391 --> 00:51:29,150
yourself be used by the far right to 
justify,

1047
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:31,340
you know,
taking down other groups.

1048
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:37,320
Oh,
that's an interesting way of looking at 

1049
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:37,320
it.
Yeah.

1050
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:39,010
So that.
I mean that's one way that you could 

1051
00:51:39,010 --> 00:51:39,010
look at it,
but

1052
00:51:39,010 --> 00:51:39,920
was that way possible to look at it?
That doesn't even make any sense.

1053
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:41,840
You.
How would the far.

1054
00:51:41,841 --> 00:51:43,820
Right,
so the fire,

1055
00:51:43,950 --> 00:51:48,740
Rachel hold of the superiority of Asians
in academics

1056
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:54,060
because there are other racial groups 
that they don't like or I guess they 

1057
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:56,761
disliked more than they dislike Asians,
so they'll use Asians as a way to 

1058
00:51:56,761 --> 00:51:58,720
justify discrimination against those 
other groups.

1059
00:51:58,721 --> 00:52:00,190
I don't.
I don't really buy that,

1060
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:04,120
but that's an argument I've heard the 
arguments sucks.

1061
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:06,250
I'd like to sit down with someone with 
that argument.

1062
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:09,100
That's a stupid argument.
That argument doesn't work.

1063
00:52:09,550 --> 00:52:14,550
It doesn't work.
What I find the most sad is there are 

1064
00:52:14,550 --> 00:52:14,550
Asians who are totally fine and they 
say,

1065
00:52:14,550 --> 00:52:18,601
I'm willing to give up my spot for 
someone else because I think diversity 

1066
00:52:18,601 --> 00:52:20,200
is important and I think that someone 
who needs friends,

1067
00:52:21,310 --> 00:52:23,830
you need friends so bad you willing to 
say that,

1068
00:52:23,831 --> 00:52:26,200
but that's a virtue signaling thing.
That's one of those.

1069
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:27,850
I hope so.
I hope it's purchasing the.

1070
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:29,770
It's not someone who actually thinks 
that way.

1071
00:52:30,270 --> 00:52:35,270
They could actually think that way,
but the people cut their balls off and 

1072
00:52:35,270 --> 00:52:39,230
killed themselves because they thought 
the comment was coming in the spaceship 

1073
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:39,230
is behind it.
They thought that too.

1074
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:41,850
People think all kinds of things.
They think all kinds of things.

1075
00:52:41,930 --> 00:52:46,930
Yeah,
and that is one of the main reasons why 

1076
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:49,800
I wanted to talk to you is that people 
do think all kinds of things I want to,

1077
00:52:50,030 --> 00:52:50,800
I want,
you know,

1078
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:53,790
I want to talk to neuroscientists,
figure out what's happening.

1079
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:55,760
What is it?
Yeah.

1080
00:52:56,020 --> 00:53:01,020
Let's,
you were saying something about the 

1081
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:01,020
Google memo earlier though.
Yeah,

1082
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:01,020
yes.

1083
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:01,020
Yeah.
That's A.

1084
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:01,620
I mean,
I had james on and you know,

1085
00:53:01,621 --> 00:53:04,620
he's kind of fucked now.
He doesn't really have a home.

1086
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:07,620
He doesn't have a place to go.
And I mean in terms of like,

1087
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:12,360
like politically,
politically or in terms of having a job.

1088
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:15,230
I mean he's like almost hireable.
I mean,

1089
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:17,880
uh,
I don't know if he's employed now,

1090
00:53:17,881 --> 00:53:22,881
but he was in this lawsuit with Google 
and scientifically he has every point in

1091
00:53:24,721 --> 00:53:26,370
the.
I just don't know

1092
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:28,260
if it's ever going to hold up in this 
climate.

1093
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:33,400
Yeah.
So I actually got a chance to talk to 

1094
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:35,711
james as part of.
So there's a podcast wrong speak that I 

1095
00:53:35,711 --> 00:53:38,741
host with Jonathan Kay and our first 
episode was actually about James to and 

1096
00:53:38,741 --> 00:53:42,650
his saga and basically how,
what I took away from that whole thing,

1097
00:53:42,651 --> 00:53:47,651
I mean it's been almost a year now.
It's amazing how the media could not get

1098
00:53:47,901 --> 00:53:50,510
it right and I feel that they 
intentionally smeared him.

1099
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:55,540
It wasn't that people didn't understand 
the science so that they very 

1100
00:53:55,540 --> 00:53:57,941
intentionally said we don't like this.
We want to get clicks or we want to 

1101
00:53:57,941 --> 00:54:01,130
basically sacrifices man for our agenda.

1102
00:54:01,350 --> 00:54:03,540
I agree with you and I don't think it's 
just the media.

1103
00:54:03,541 --> 00:54:08,541
I think it was the CEO of.
Was it youtube that was saying that it 

1104
00:54:08,541 --> 00:54:10,670
was promoting harmful gender 
stereotypes?

1105
00:54:10,671 --> 00:54:12,630
Vp of Google put that statement out 
there.

1106
00:54:12,631 --> 00:54:13,560
Other people.
Yeah,

1107
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:18,650
but one of the,
one of the women that ran youtube was 

1108
00:54:18,650 --> 00:54:22,190
talking about a two and the way she was 
describing it was as if he was talking 

1109
00:54:22,190 --> 00:54:23,700
about women being inferior and that's 
not what he said or somebody said,

1110
00:54:23,790 --> 00:54:28,790
and not only that they neglected to to 
promote the fact that it was at least a 

1111
00:54:29,731 --> 00:54:34,731
page and a half of that memo was about 
how to encourage women to be more active

1112
00:54:35,611 --> 00:54:36,400
in tech.
Yeah.

1113
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:39,020
This was not an anti woman scream.

1114
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:40,390
No,
no,

1115
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:43,730
and I mean if you hear what he had to 
save when I spoke with him,

1116
00:54:43,731 --> 00:54:48,731
he very much was for equality and very 
much it was for men and women being 

1117
00:54:49,070 --> 00:54:50,270
working together,
you know,

1118
00:54:50,271 --> 00:54:55,271
and it's not a misogynist.
I think it's crazy that that's the 

1119
00:54:55,271 --> 00:54:55,271
narrative that continues to go on now.

1120
00:54:55,770 --> 00:54:59,210
Well,
the problem is he actually started.

1121
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:04,280
He actually cited the studies that 
showed why people choose different 

1122
00:55:05,101 --> 00:55:10,101
professions,
why people gravitate towards different 

1123
00:55:10,101 --> 00:55:11,490
activities in different professions 
based on gender.

1124
00:55:11,670 --> 00:55:16,440
And these are actual studies.
So in inciting those studies,

1125
00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:21,470
he cited something that's contrary to 
this promoted narrative and that's where

1126
00:55:22,081 --> 00:55:25,080
he was shot down.
Hence the title of your podcast.

1127
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:27,030
He did wrong.
Speak,

1128
00:55:27,070 --> 00:55:27,340
right?

1129
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:28,730
Yeah.
And the thing is,

1130
00:55:28,930 --> 00:55:33,930
the most important aspect of the podcast
is that the things that people are 

1131
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:34,430
saying,
there's some truth to it.

1132
00:55:34,431 --> 00:55:36,950
It's not just crazy loopy ideas,
right?

1133
00:55:36,951 --> 00:55:38,630
There's,
there's truth to it.

1134
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:41,000
But for some reason we still can't say 
it.

1135
00:55:41,001 --> 00:55:41,870
And why is that?

1136
00:55:42,350 --> 00:55:47,350
I don't know why that is.
But the problem with denial of any facts

1137
00:55:49,130 --> 00:55:54,130
is that the people that are opposing you
now have evidence that you're alone,

1138
00:55:54,950 --> 00:55:59,950
right?
Like one of the problems with the left 

1139
00:55:59,950 --> 00:56:02,651
and this really radical progressive 
behavior that's in denial of science is 

1140
00:56:02,841 --> 00:56:05,270
now the right gets to look at the lab 
and go,

1141
00:56:05,271 --> 00:56:06,890
look,
these people are their fucking mind.

1142
00:56:06,891 --> 00:56:10,130
Why do you trust him about abortion?
Why do you trust him about this?

1143
00:56:10,131 --> 00:56:11,720
Why do you trust them about climate 
change?

1144
00:56:11,930 --> 00:56:16,550
Clearly there loons and this,
this is mean.

1145
00:56:16,551 --> 00:56:19,790
This is just weird toxic tribal 
behavior.

1146
00:56:20,430 --> 00:56:21,210
Yeah,
because I mean,

1147
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:23,260
how can you legitimately denied,
like you're saying,

1148
00:56:23,290 --> 00:56:26,800
men and women are different when you say
that people stop listening,

1149
00:56:27,130 --> 00:56:31,630
they do think you're a crazy person and 
they miss the larger point because there

1150
00:56:31,631 --> 00:56:33,280
are some people who will look at that 
and say,

1151
00:56:33,310 --> 00:56:34,420
okay,
men and women are different.

1152
00:56:34,421 --> 00:56:39,421
That must mean women are not competent.
So instead of having this more nuanced 

1153
00:56:39,421 --> 00:56:41,110
argument or discussion about we can be 
different,

1154
00:56:41,111 --> 00:56:42,940
but that doesn't mean women are in 
competent.

1155
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:48,180
They just simply say,
you want to say that men and women are 

1156
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:48,180
the same,
so we,

1157
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:51,000
you know,
we're not even speaking at the same 

1158
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:51,000
level and in that case,

1159
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,250
well it's so foolish and we are,
there's clearly differences between men 

1160
00:56:58,251 --> 00:57:01,150
and women and there's clearly 
differences inside genders.

1161
00:57:01,151 --> 00:57:06,151
I mean there's human beings very widely 
and wildly and it's one of the more 

1162
00:57:06,151 --> 00:57:07,510
interesting things about us.
I mean,

1163
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:10,480
it's a good thing.
It's a fascinating thing because it's,

1164
00:57:11,390 --> 00:57:14,510
the whole thing has got to go like this.
It's got to move around.

1165
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:16,790
And the only way it moves around as if 
everybody's different.

1166
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,090
If everybody just a block,
it's the same shape,

1167
00:57:20,091 --> 00:57:22,520
the same density,
the same size,

1168
00:57:22,521 --> 00:57:24,500
like what is that?
That's.

1169
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,300
Well,
it's not just boring.

1170
00:57:26,301 --> 00:57:28,160
You're not going to have a competence 
society.

1171
00:57:28,161 --> 00:57:31,130
It's not going to work like you need 
soft and hard.

1172
00:57:31,131 --> 00:57:34,070
You need both.
You need something in between.

1173
00:57:34,071 --> 00:57:39,071
You need far extreme right to polarize 
and activate the far extreme left.

1174
00:57:39,981 --> 00:57:44,981
I mean I really think you need a guy 
like trump to get people to be more 

1175
00:57:44,981 --> 00:57:46,340
politically active and more socially 
active.

1176
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:51,340
I think in many ways he does the left of
service by providing this like 

1177
00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:55,750
ridiculous figurehead of what's possible
with ego and greed and and and right 

1178
00:57:56,091 --> 00:58:00,710
wing gone a muck Steve Bannon's and the 
breitbarts and all that.

1179
00:58:00,711 --> 00:58:05,711
Stuff like that.
Stuff empowers the other side and the 

1180
00:58:05,711 --> 00:58:09,581
good thing about it is somewhere in the 
middle is like a balanced healthy 

1181
00:58:09,581 --> 00:58:10,730
society and hopefully we'll be able to 
achieve that someday.

1182
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:16,240
But I mean this is the argument always 
is that you cannot have light without 

1183
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:19,010
dark and have good without evil and the 
pendulum is gonna Swing back,

1184
00:58:19,011 --> 00:58:21,350
hopefully just waiting for that to 
happen.

1185
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:24,200
It always does,
it seems to always do that.

1186
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:29,500
I just would hope that with the amount 
of information that's available today 

1187
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:33,560
that we can look at the actual studies 
that are being done on gender,

1188
00:58:33,561 --> 00:58:35,360
on sex,
on biology,

1189
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:40,600
and don't look at it in terms of don't 
quantify it in terms of the this side's 

1190
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:40,790
better.

1191
00:58:40,790 --> 00:58:42,070
That's it's better.
Just look at it.

1192
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:46,880
What fascinating differences.
This is amazing and it's interesting and

1193
00:58:46,881 --> 00:58:51,881
there's a lot of dummies that are men 
and there's a lot of dummies that are 

1194
00:58:51,881 --> 00:58:52,430
women.
They're just dummies and it doesn't have

1195
00:58:52,431 --> 00:58:56,660
anything to do with one gender being 
superior or one gender being inferior.

1196
00:58:56,690 --> 00:59:01,690
It's just human beings have a lot of 
variability and there's a lot of 

1197
00:59:01,690 --> 00:59:05,891
different things that a lot of inputs 
and you developing and becoming a 30 

1198
00:59:06,770 --> 00:59:11,770
year old person that happens to be 
talking to this other 30 year old 

1199
00:59:11,770 --> 00:59:12,650
person.
Your path to get to wherever you are.

1200
00:59:13,490 --> 00:59:18,490
There's so much going on.
There's influences in terms of your 

1201
00:59:18,490 --> 00:59:19,820
environment,
your education,

1202
00:59:19,821 --> 00:59:21,080
your,
your life,

1203
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:24,890
your family,
your loved ones,

1204
00:59:24,891 --> 00:59:29,891
your.
There's so much that leads to you being 

1205
00:59:29,891 --> 00:59:32,780
who you are today and it's really 
fascinating to study that,

1206
00:59:33,050 --> 00:59:35,330
but only if you're allowed to actually 
look at it

1207
00:59:35,390 --> 00:59:40,390
and be honest with you because there's 
no point otherwise if you're just going 

1208
00:59:40,390 --> 00:59:41,320
to keep pumping out,
like from a research perspective,

1209
00:59:41,330 --> 00:59:42,230
you,
if you go in,

1210
00:59:42,231 --> 00:59:44,660
the only scientists are going to look at
this stuff now.

1211
00:59:44,661 --> 00:59:46,640
The people who know what they're going 
to find in advance,

1212
00:59:46,850 --> 00:59:49,130
they're not going to publish anything 
that's gonna upset the public.

1213
00:59:49,370 --> 00:59:54,370
So in my mind there was no point to even
do that kind of research because that's 

1214
00:59:54,370 --> 00:59:54,370
not actually science what you're doing.

1215
00:59:54,370 --> 00:59:55,380
Yeah,
that's really crazy,

1216
00:59:55,381 --> 01:00:00,381
right?
That's where it gets really crazy or 

1217
01:00:00,381 --> 01:00:02,691
you're not even allowed to do certain 
kinds of research or if you are doing 

1218
01:00:03,331 --> 01:00:04,980
it,
you're going to be categorized,

1219
01:00:05,010 --> 01:00:06,270
oh,
he's all right.

1220
01:00:06,630 --> 01:00:07,560
Or your,
you know,

1221
01:00:07,561 --> 01:00:12,360
you're conservative or you're a 
whatever.

1222
01:00:12,530 --> 01:00:13,850
Whenever you are,
you're bad.

1223
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:15,330
You're wrong.
Speak.

1224
01:00:15,430 --> 01:00:16,360
Yeah.
Yeah,

1225
01:00:16,361 --> 01:00:21,361
exactly.
And why did you decide to call your 

1226
01:00:21,361 --> 01:00:21,361
podcast that?
I mean,

1227
01:00:21,361 --> 01:00:22,240
it's,
it's a throwback to Orwell,

1228
01:00:22,241 --> 01:00:27,241
obviously in 1984,
and this idea that by controlling 

1229
01:00:27,241 --> 01:00:30,841
language we can control the government,
can control how people think and what 

1230
01:00:30,841 --> 01:00:35,011
reality is.
And what I find interesting is with the 

1231
01:00:35,011 --> 01:00:38,641
topics we covered.
So first episode we talked to James 

1232
01:00:38,641 --> 01:00:41,640
Damore,
second episode we talked to Lindsay 

1233
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:42,280
Shepherd and looked at the whole what 
happened at Wilfrid laurier university.

1234
01:00:42,550 --> 01:00:47,550
Um,
and then the third one is rapid onset 

1235
01:00:47,550 --> 01:00:49,621
gender dysphoria.
So looking at this trend and adolescent 

1236
01:00:49,621 --> 01:00:53,191
girls who come out as transgender even 
though they've had no previous signs of 

1237
01:00:53,191 --> 01:00:54,370
gender dysphoria.
And so with all of them,

1238
01:00:54,371 --> 01:00:56,790
these,
these issues are all super taboo and all

1239
01:00:56,810 --> 01:01:01,810
these people have been mobbed.
And in the case of rapid onset gender 

1240
01:01:01,810 --> 01:01:02,440
dysphoria,
you see the parents who are being called

1241
01:01:02,441 --> 01:01:05,680
Trans phobic for questioning is my 
daughter really trends,

1242
01:01:05,970 --> 01:01:07,450
you know,
we're just trying to get at the truth.

1243
01:01:07,451 --> 01:01:09,010
Really.
We're trying to understand,

1244
01:01:09,380 --> 01:01:14,380
you know,
why is it we can't talk about these 

1245
01:01:14,380 --> 01:01:15,991
things?
Why is it we're in such a situation now 

1246
01:01:15,991 --> 01:01:15,991
that the,
the response to any sort of,

1247
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:21,040
um,
unpopular idea is to be mobbed into 

1248
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:22,700
attack people and intimidate them and 
shut the conversation down.

1249
01:01:22,730 --> 01:01:24,160
Like how do we stop that from happening?

1250
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:28,370
Explained rapid onset gender dysphoria 
because I'm not really aware of that.

1251
01:01:28,620 --> 01:01:31,620
So it's this phenomenon that's been 
growing more recently.

1252
01:01:31,730 --> 01:01:36,730
How recently,
I'd probably say in the last 10 years 

1253
01:01:36,730 --> 01:01:39,200
there's been a switch though before,
a referrals to gender clinics have kids 

1254
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:40,290
who are feeling that they are born the 
opposite.

1255
01:01:40,291 --> 01:01:45,291
Sex was predominantly boys.
And then suddenly there's been this 

1256
01:01:45,291 --> 01:01:46,770
explosion of girls.
And so when you talk to the parents,

1257
01:01:46,790 --> 01:01:48,170
um,
and it's interesting when,

1258
01:01:48,190 --> 01:01:49,800
when you listened to the episode that we
did,

1259
01:01:50,010 --> 01:01:53,310
their stories are so similar.
They're literally identical.

1260
01:01:53,311 --> 01:01:58,311
They,
their daughters have always been gender 

1261
01:01:58,311 --> 01:01:58,311
typical.
So they're always very girly girls.

1262
01:01:58,311 --> 01:02:00,120
They've never been gender dysphoric.
They go through puberty,

1263
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:01,330
they develop,
you know,

1264
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:06,360
there's no problem there.
Then usually what happens is there's 

1265
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:09,221
some sort of Dunno educational session 
at school or one of these girls,

1266
01:02:09,871 --> 01:02:13,290
their friends come out as trans.
And then the daughter says,

1267
01:02:13,291 --> 01:02:14,550
oh,
I want to be a boy.

1268
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:19,740
And so if you take that child to a 
professional like therapist,

1269
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:22,890
the therapist has to affirm,
the therapist can question that.

1270
01:02:23,210 --> 01:02:28,210
And so you have these girls,
a lot of them have autism or they have 

1271
01:02:28,210 --> 01:02:30,981
other mental health issues.
They're not getting treated for those 

1272
01:02:30,981 --> 01:02:30,981
issues.
Instead they're being told,

1273
01:02:30,981 --> 01:02:32,910
okay,
if you want to transition will help you.

1274
01:02:33,030 --> 01:02:35,340
And like I said,
I'm not against adults transitioning.

1275
01:02:35,341 --> 01:02:38,220
I don't think it's anyone's place to 
tell an adult what to do.

1276
01:02:38,221 --> 01:02:40,050
And I think transitioning can be 
beneficial,

1277
01:02:40,051 --> 01:02:42,780
but you want this.
If someone transitions,

1278
01:02:42,781 --> 01:02:44,850
you want it to actually help them feel 
better.

1279
01:02:45,180 --> 01:02:47,730
And for these girls,
if the issue is not even about gender,

1280
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:50,010
it doesn't make sense for them to 
transition

1281
01:02:50,630 --> 01:02:53,890
mother's rapid onset gender dysphoria.
Is this typically females?

1282
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:54,130
Yeah,

1283
01:02:54,340 --> 01:02:55,990
almost all females.
What would,

1284
01:02:56,020 --> 01:02:59,350
what is the cause of that?
I think it's social contagion.

1285
01:02:59,351 --> 01:03:04,351
I think part of it is for some of these 
girls they are a bit socially awkward 

1286
01:03:04,351 --> 01:03:04,570
and so when they come out as 
transgender,

1287
01:03:04,571 --> 01:03:07,210
suddenly everybody loves them and wants 
to support them.

1288
01:03:07,211 --> 01:03:09,070
And I think as people should for trans 
people,

1289
01:03:09,071 --> 01:03:11,320
because obviously it's a difficult thing
to go through,

1290
01:03:11,650 --> 01:03:16,650
but I think there's an aspect of it that
people aren't talking about that kids 

1291
01:03:16,650 --> 01:03:19,000
are coming out as transgender just 
because it gives them acceptance,

1292
01:03:19,110 --> 01:03:24,110
an extra reward.
There's a reward in terms of the 

1293
01:03:24,110 --> 01:03:24,110
attention.
Right?

1294
01:03:24,110 --> 01:03:25,840
Yeah.
And also I think for girls,

1295
01:03:25,890 --> 01:03:28,690
I mean puberty is not a fun time.
Puberty's not a fun time for anybody,

1296
01:03:29,050 --> 01:03:32,110
but for God,
you didn't go through puberty.

1297
01:03:32,111 --> 01:03:32,260
Okay.

1298
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:33,600
Okay.
I did.

1299
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:34,870
But I mean,
you know,

1300
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:37,470
for like I love when people say,
well,

1301
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:39,130
it's harder for guys.
Who the fuck would,

1302
01:03:39,131 --> 01:03:40,900
you know,
he never been a girl.

1303
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:44,380
It's hard for everybody.
Everyone is kind of awkward and Lanky.

1304
01:03:44,381 --> 01:03:45,310
You know,
life is hard.

1305
01:03:45,670 --> 01:03:50,670
Life is weird.
You being a person being a finite 

1306
01:03:50,670 --> 01:03:50,670
organism,
cleaning to a ball,

1307
01:03:50,670 --> 01:03:52,720
it's spinning a thousand miles an hour 
hurling through infinity.

1308
01:03:52,990 --> 01:03:54,850
That's weird.
Life's weird.

1309
01:03:55,120 --> 01:04:00,120
And then the fact that your biology 
changes and you get inundated with 

1310
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:00,390
hormones,
it's uh,

1311
01:04:00,530 --> 01:04:05,530
just the,
the life that we live and then adapting 

1312
01:04:05,530 --> 01:04:05,860
to culture and trying to figure out how 
to be accepted.

1313
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:08,560
And I think that that certainly plays a 
part,

1314
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:13,800
this rapid onset gender dysphoria.
How is this being treated like in terms 

1315
01:04:15,461 --> 01:04:19,510
of like how's this being accepted in 
academia?

1316
01:04:19,570 --> 01:04:24,570
How's it being discussed in the 
literature and what are the 

1317
01:04:24,570 --> 01:04:27,280
recommendations for what to do about it 
or to descriptions of what it is.

1318
01:04:27,620 --> 01:04:32,620
Well,
there's only been one study so far 

1319
01:04:32,620 --> 01:04:34,301
that's been published because it is such
a new phenomenon and because it is so 

1320
01:04:34,301 --> 01:04:37,700
hard to do this work because,
I mean people call it a myth pretty much

1321
01:04:37,701 --> 01:04:41,960
anything that counters the transgender 
narrative is considered hate speech.

1322
01:04:42,170 --> 01:04:47,170
So as a researcher,
if you try to do any research on this 

1323
01:04:47,170 --> 01:04:49,910
issue that goes against what trans 
activists say is acceptable,

1324
01:04:49,911 --> 01:04:51,110
you know,
you're going to get into trouble.

1325
01:04:51,111 --> 01:04:53,720
So no one wants to touch it.
So there's been one study that did show,

1326
01:04:53,721 --> 01:04:55,340
you know,
with girls especially,

1327
01:04:55,341 --> 01:04:59,120
it's very much about being influenced by
friends within a peer group.

1328
01:04:59,121 --> 01:05:04,121
I think there's some crazy high number 
in terms of the number of girls that 

1329
01:05:04,121 --> 01:05:04,130
will come out as transgender one after 
the other,

1330
01:05:04,430 --> 01:05:06,190
so it's real.
But I,

1331
01:05:06,191 --> 01:05:11,191
I mean I get why people find it,
some people find it threatening because 

1332
01:05:11,191 --> 01:05:12,890
it suggests that maybe trans people 
aren't really transgender,

1333
01:05:12,980 --> 01:05:17,980
you know,
maybe the way they feel isn't 

1334
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:19,301
legitimate,
but in terms of the way to treat there 

1335
01:05:19,301 --> 01:05:20,140
are these parents are at our last.
I mean the,

1336
01:05:20,141 --> 01:05:25,141
the,
these girls are not getting treated for 

1337
01:05:25,141 --> 01:05:25,141
the underlying condition.
There was one parent we spoke to,

1338
01:05:25,141 --> 01:05:30,120
he saw nine mental health professionals.
Every single one said that your 

1339
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:34,021
daughter's not transgender,
but they couldn't go on the record as 

1340
01:05:34,021 --> 01:05:36,721
saying.
So I think only one went on the record 

1341
01:05:36,721 --> 01:05:36,721
of saying so because they're terrified.

1342
01:05:36,721 --> 01:05:38,320
They're terrified of losing their job.
They're terrified of being attack.

1343
01:05:38,350 --> 01:05:39,160
Yeah.
Yeah,

1344
01:05:39,161 --> 01:05:44,161
definitely.
It's so interesting where you watched 

1345
01:05:44,161 --> 01:05:47,071
the similarities between any group that 
like is that feels that they're being 

1346
01:05:49,751 --> 01:05:54,751
maligned or that are being very 
defensive about their position and 

1347
01:05:54,751 --> 01:05:57,310
trying to hold strong and aggressively 
attacking people that are against it.

1348
01:05:57,790 --> 01:06:02,790
It in many ways this sort of behavior is
mirrored in the second amendment.

1349
01:06:03,701 --> 01:06:08,701
People like the people that are pro gun,
like if you tried any gun restrictions 

1350
01:06:09,550 --> 01:06:14,550
or any gun legislation or any changes in
the laws of gun control,

1351
01:06:15,490 --> 01:06:18,470
they aggressively go after it.
They,

1352
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:22,210
they,
they do whatever they can to keep things

1353
01:06:22,211 --> 01:06:26,980
the way they are now and show how much 
positive benefits guns have and how,

1354
01:06:27,050 --> 01:06:31,090
how many people are saved by guns.
But it's this thing besides the gun,

1355
01:06:31,091 --> 01:06:33,160
take the gun out of it and it's this.

1356
01:06:33,250 --> 01:06:36,550
It's the defense of the idea.
It's like very committed.

1357
01:06:36,580 --> 01:06:37,170
Yeah,
they are.

1358
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:42,200
They identify with being a person who's 
a gun nut or a gun supporter of Second 

1359
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:42,970
Amendment,
you know,

1360
01:06:43,270 --> 01:06:45,760
freedom loving and I got a fucking eagle
on my back.

1361
01:06:46,030 --> 01:06:46,960
You know,
that kind of shit.

1362
01:06:46,961 --> 01:06:51,961
And it's like.
And this the same thing with trans 

1363
01:06:51,961 --> 01:06:51,961
people.
Like anything against anything,

1364
01:06:51,961 --> 01:06:53,620
what you're saying,
this is impossible.

1365
01:06:53,830 --> 01:06:58,830
This thing that you're talking about,
this rapid onset gender dysphoria being 

1366
01:06:58,830 --> 01:07:02,161
autistic people that is transphobic and 
the and they get super hyper aggressive 

1367
01:07:02,161 --> 01:07:02,530
about it.
Instead of saying,

1368
01:07:02,740 --> 01:07:03,340
Oh,
well,

1369
01:07:03,670 --> 01:07:05,960
whoever this person is,
if they're a trans person,

1370
01:07:05,961 --> 01:07:06,520
so saying,
well,

1371
01:07:06,521 --> 01:07:10,180
I am legitimately trans,
but his entire po entirely possible that

1372
01:07:10,181 --> 01:07:15,181
there's a broad spectrum of human 
behavior and human thought and that some

1373
01:07:15,671 --> 01:07:18,730
of these people have a real issue and I 
could see the reward,

1374
01:07:18,731 --> 01:07:23,731
especially in today's climate.
When you look at today's climate was 

1375
01:07:23,731 --> 01:07:24,340
that would be an interesting study,
right?

1376
01:07:24,490 --> 01:07:29,490
If you look at the climate of today and 
the support of trans people and the 

1377
01:07:30,610 --> 01:07:35,610
attacking of people that are transphobic
and the the overwhelming social benefit 

1378
01:07:38,381 --> 01:07:43,210
of supporting trans people and then you 
look at the rapid onset gender dysphoria

1379
01:07:43,211 --> 01:07:46,300
and see if they match up what you were 
saying.

1380
01:07:46,301 --> 01:07:47,150
Actually I.
The

1381
01:07:47,150 --> 01:07:51,710
majority of Trans People are not on 
board with this whole across the board.

1382
01:07:51,711 --> 01:07:53,870
Everyone should just transition,
but I think it's.

1383
01:07:54,020 --> 01:07:58,460
It's another case of the vocal minority 
saying shutting down.

1384
01:07:58,550 --> 01:08:00,140
Anyone who dares to disagree,

1385
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:05,640
well,
some trans people get very upset if non 

1386
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:06,790
trans people talk about Trans people 
were just hilarious.

1387
01:08:07,380 --> 01:08:09,850
Like what are we supposed to do?
Supposed to just shut our mouths and let

1388
01:08:09,851 --> 01:08:12,940
you just run things like shit,
I don't know what to do.

1389
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:15,560
Like the Scarlett Johannsen things 
fascinating.

1390
01:08:15,830 --> 01:08:20,360
She was going to play a trans woman in a
movie and people freaked out.

1391
01:08:20,580 --> 01:08:21,530
Trans Man,
sorry,

1392
01:08:21,710 --> 01:08:26,710
a trans man in a movie and people 
freaked out that she is not trans and 

1393
01:08:27,441 --> 01:08:28,850
she's.
She has this part,

1394
01:08:29,320 --> 01:08:34,320
you know,
that was the same thing that happened 

1395
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:35,671
with Jeffrey tambor.
Jeffrey tambor was accused of sexual 

1396
01:08:35,671 --> 01:08:36,800
harassment by people in the set who are 
trans,

1397
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:41,960
who were also very upset that he was the
star of a television show that was about

1398
01:08:41,961 --> 01:08:44,690
trans people and he's not trans and they
were trans.

1399
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:47,420
I get where people are coming from.
I do because you know,

1400
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:47,700
they.

1401
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:52,960
I think representation is important to 
some extent and so I can understand if 

1402
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:56,390
you are of a group that isn't being 
represented in the media,

1403
01:08:56,570 --> 01:08:59,780
how you would want that to change.
Yeah.

1404
01:08:59,781 --> 01:09:04,781
But you also looking at an alias actress
who would bring an incredible amount of 

1405
01:09:04,781 --> 01:09:07,660
attention to your progressive project 
and you know,

1406
01:09:07,670 --> 01:09:12,470
it may very well change the tone of the 
way people accept trans people.

1407
01:09:12,790 --> 01:09:14,540
Like if it's portrayed in a positive 
light,

1408
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:17,480
it's entirely possible that it would 
open up.

1409
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:22,700
Like,
especially if people that are on the 

1410
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:24,251
fence,
it might open up their heart and they 

1411
01:09:24,251 --> 01:09:24,251
make them look at things differently and
say,

1412
01:09:24,251 --> 01:09:24,620
oh,
okay,

1413
01:09:24,621 --> 01:09:27,170
I see where this woman wanted,
you know,

1414
01:09:27,370 --> 01:09:32,370
she,
she wanted to transition to be a man 

1415
01:09:32,370 --> 01:09:33,200
because she was wired incorrectly or 
wired to be a man.

1416
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:37,520
I shouldn't even say it incorrectly.
Like maybe you could see her as a person

1417
01:09:37,521 --> 01:09:42,521
now instead of just as a subject for 
debate or as a career I would have,

1418
01:09:45,771 --> 01:09:49,370
is not with your appointment with my 
point with the tokenization of people.

1419
01:09:49,370 --> 01:09:50,090
So to say,
okay,

1420
01:09:50,091 --> 01:09:52,850
if this is a trans role,
we need to find a trans person.

1421
01:09:52,870 --> 01:09:53,520
Right.
You know,

1422
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:58,600
same as with racial tokenization.
Like we need to have a certain quota so 

1423
01:09:58,600 --> 01:09:59,660
we need to have this many number of 
people that fit this.

1424
01:10:00,110 --> 01:10:02,140
That's my only issue because then people
look at it and say,

1425
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:04,550
you only pick this person because of 
their identity,

1426
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:06,500
not because of what they brought to the 
table.

1427
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:09,710
True.
But I could argue against that.

1428
01:10:09,890 --> 01:10:13,340
If you go back and look and like John 
Wayne when he played gingiss con,

1429
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:15,850
like what in the fuck was that?
Well,

1430
01:10:16,060 --> 01:10:19,040
there's a bunch of those really goofy 
ones like Charlie Chan.

1431
01:10:19,310 --> 01:10:21,650
Do you ever see the old school Charlie 
Chan movies?

1432
01:10:21,850 --> 01:10:24,170
I think so.
I think we can find Charlie Chan.

1433
01:10:24,171 --> 01:10:26,810
It's fucking ridiculous.
I mean,

1434
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,210
couldn't even get an Asian guy to play 
Charlie Chan,

1435
01:10:29,211 --> 01:10:30,230
but the fuck is this.

1436
01:10:30,570 --> 01:10:35,570
Or maybe they didn't even.
They didn't even try to make John Wayne 

1437
01:10:35,990 --> 01:10:38,150
look like he was Chinese.
You know?

1438
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:43,180
I mean there was a lot of that going on.
You do you ever see that ad where you 

1439
01:10:43,180 --> 01:10:44,150
see the native American?
Yeah,

1440
01:10:44,151 --> 01:10:48,520
there's,
there's the guy who played the.

1441
01:10:48,740 --> 01:10:53,740
Kathleen did that motherfucker doesn't 
even look a little Chinese and he talked

1442
01:10:54,470 --> 01:10:58,790
like a real stereotypical,
like shitty Chinese accent.

1443
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:00,890
It's a bit offensive.
Super Offensive.

1444
01:11:00,891 --> 01:11:03,050
Right?
But that was the sign of the Times.

1445
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:05,120
And so what trans people would say,
it was like,

1446
01:11:05,121 --> 01:11:07,070
look,
this is the same goddamn thing.

1447
01:11:07,550 --> 01:11:12,550
This is just you're looking at in terms 
of Chinese people were looking at in 

1448
01:11:12,550 --> 01:11:14,490
terms of our people and you know,
we're not being represented

1449
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:18,630
and you have someone playing us.
Do you remember that native American ad?

1450
01:11:18,631 --> 01:11:23,631
There was an ad where someone would 
throw litter out of the car window and 

1451
01:11:23,631 --> 01:11:24,930
the native American guy had a tear 
running down his cheek.

1452
01:11:24,980 --> 01:11:25,820
I do remember that.
Yeah.

1453
01:11:25,860 --> 01:11:29,720
The Guy was Italian.
He wasn't even a little bit of American.

1454
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:32,110
Will they do now?
Anybody listening?

1455
01:11:33,380 --> 01:11:36,480
Some people know because I didn't like,
I'm not a researcher.

1456
01:11:36,820 --> 01:11:39,790
I didn't.
I didn't go deep and investigate.

1457
01:11:39,791 --> 01:11:40,950
I would just read it.
I was like,

1458
01:11:40,951 --> 01:11:42,240
that's hilarious.
Yeah.

1459
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:44,160
I mean,
I think for a lot of these issues at the

1460
01:11:44,161 --> 01:11:45,930
core,
there's something valuable there.

1461
01:11:45,931 --> 01:11:48,240
I do get the concern and I am empathic 
for that,

1462
01:11:48,241 --> 01:11:50,820
but it's to the point now where it's 
like every little thing.

1463
01:11:50,930 --> 01:11:52,540
Yeah.
Well people,

1464
01:11:52,710 --> 01:11:57,710
this is the outrage culture.
People were like super pumped to find 

1465
01:11:57,710 --> 01:12:00,891
something that's outrageous and then 
point fingers and attack and they love 

1466
01:12:01,171 --> 01:12:02,220
it when people back down.

1467
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:04,320
Oh,
they're so excited.

1468
01:12:04,530 --> 01:12:06,900
So like when scarlet Johannson backed 
out of that movie,

1469
01:12:06,901 --> 01:12:09,000
everybody got so excited.
We did it.

1470
01:12:09,001 --> 01:12:10,820
Girls,
we've fucking got her,

1471
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:12,000
you know,
and,

1472
01:12:12,001 --> 01:12:14,340
but when people don't back down,
they get,

1473
01:12:14,550 --> 01:12:17,040
they just give up or they get confused.
They don't know what to do,

1474
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:19,260
but that's the thing I find when you 
don't back down,

1475
01:12:19,261 --> 01:12:21,240
they go and they find someone else,
they'll leave you alone.

1476
01:12:21,290 --> 01:12:22,950
Do you see what happened to Anthony 
Jeselnik?

1477
01:12:23,130 --> 01:12:23,680
No,
I didn't.

1478
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:29,360
They're attacking Anthony Jeselnik.
They're attacking a bunch of people for 

1479
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:30,030
tweet jokes.
After James Gunn got fired.

1480
01:12:30,031 --> 01:12:35,031
You Know James Gunn is,
he's the guy who was the director of 

1481
01:12:35,031 --> 01:12:35,240
Guardians of the galaxy.
Uh,

1482
01:12:35,580 --> 01:12:40,580
he had some really questionable tweets 
that were jokes.

1483
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:44,100
They're just,
he wrote some jokey joke things,

1484
01:12:44,340 --> 01:12:49,340
but it's like about pedophilia.
Like there was like a huge screen of 

1485
01:12:51,051 --> 01:12:52,610
them copied and pasted.
Yeah.

1486
01:12:52,610 --> 01:12:53,970
Yeah.
They're fucking terrible.

1487
01:12:54,350 --> 01:12:56,730
The problem is they're not funny in the 
end,

1488
01:12:56,731 --> 01:13:00,210
their jokes and they're really gross,
but should he be fired for that?

1489
01:13:00,211 --> 01:13:01,980
No,
he's just a shitty joke teller.

1490
01:13:02,370 --> 01:13:04,200
If you find out he's actually a 
pedophile,

1491
01:13:04,201 --> 01:13:06,800
that's one thing,
but it's Disney in this.

1492
01:13:06,810 --> 01:13:09,840
Today's climate,
so then they find that Anthony Jeselnik,

1493
01:13:09,870 --> 01:13:14,870
the standup comedian has a bunch of also
offensive jokes and some of them about 

1494
01:13:14,870 --> 01:13:19,131
pedophiles and so they go and try to 
attack him and Anthony Jeselnik rights.

1495
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:23,190
Looking through my twitter timeline.
Something along.

1496
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:29,360
He said,
looking is like looking for a needle in 

1497
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:30,250
a needle store on customer appreciation 
day.

1498
01:13:31,270 --> 01:13:36,270
So true waist,
his whole fucking thing is his 

1499
01:13:36,270 --> 01:13:38,250
character.
Like Anthony Jeselnik in particular,

1500
01:13:38,251 --> 01:13:43,251
I'm friends with him.
His whole thing is being ruthless and 

1501
01:13:43,251 --> 01:13:48,140
super offensive.
Like he had a show called the Jeselnik 

1502
01:13:48,140 --> 01:13:49,140
offensive.
I mean that's what he does.

1503
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:52,770
He set his character is he's an awful 
person.

1504
01:13:52,771 --> 01:13:55,800
That's the character and so they just 
gave up.

1505
01:13:55,830 --> 01:13:57,530
It's totally lost on people now,
right?

1506
01:13:57,540 --> 01:13:59,160
You can't.
You just can't say things,

1507
01:13:59,161 --> 01:14:00,180
period.
Well,

1508
01:14:00,210 --> 01:14:05,210
they're looking for people to back down 
and they're looking for people to get 

1509
01:14:05,210 --> 01:14:05,210
scared and then,
I mean,

1510
01:14:05,210 --> 01:14:07,950
this is fun.
It's fun to find a target and find a,

1511
01:14:08,010 --> 01:14:13,010
let's get him fired,
get her fired kicker tagger off that 

1512
01:14:13,010 --> 01:14:13,010
movie.

1513
01:14:13,010 --> 01:14:16,930
It's fun for them because as you know,
Hashtag air quotes activist.

1514
01:14:17,290 --> 01:14:21,760
What they're doing is they're just 
attacking and there's probably some good

1515
01:14:21,761 --> 01:14:23,170
out of it,
but look,

1516
01:14:23,350 --> 01:14:28,350
there's gotta be some good for sure.
Out of real monsters getting arrested,

1517
01:14:30,190 --> 01:14:30,850
right?
There's,

1518
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:35,880
there's some good out of like the Harvey
Weinsteins and the bill cosby's the 

1519
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:39,481
world getting arrested and getting 
busted and shutting down and we would 

1520
01:14:39,481 --> 01:14:43,771
hope that other monsters in waiting 
would not act out on their instincts 

1521
01:14:45,971 --> 01:14:50,971
because of the fact they're worried 
about the repercussions that you're 

1522
01:14:50,971 --> 01:14:53,371
clearly seeing and that we would hope 
that people that are behavior as a 

1523
01:14:53,921 --> 01:14:58,921
culture shifts one way or another and 
then it's gonna move as far away from 

1524
01:14:58,921 --> 01:15:03,631
massage and he is possible and it's 
whether it's through the threat of 

1525
01:15:03,631 --> 01:15:06,421
incarceration or shame or whatever it is
that causes it to go the other way.

1526
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:13,040
It's probably for the best as long as it
doesn't go as far as all men are pigs,

1527
01:15:14,590 --> 01:15:19,590
all men are creeps.
All men are trash and that's what we 

1528
01:15:19,590 --> 01:15:20,770
were talking about earlier.
Like when it gets to that place,

1529
01:15:20,771 --> 01:15:22,150
you got to go,
well this is not.

1530
01:15:22,270 --> 01:15:23,560
This is not a good place to be.

1531
01:15:23,670 --> 01:15:27,510
Well also if there is an allegation that
that's taken at face value right away,

1532
01:15:27,540 --> 01:15:31,230
because we do see unfortunately that 
some of these allegations are false.

1533
01:15:32,150 --> 01:15:37,150
Well,
it has to be this whole idea of believe 

1534
01:15:37,150 --> 01:15:37,150
women.
Well,

1535
01:15:37,150 --> 01:15:37,790
okay,
but that was okay.

1536
01:15:37,791 --> 01:15:42,791
Does that mean don't believe men because
some women lie and some men lives.

1537
01:15:43,190 --> 01:15:45,530
What about individuals?
What about human beings?

1538
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:48,710
So if we're going to be.
It's what we were talking about earlier,

1539
01:15:48,711 --> 01:15:50,720
like white power,
black power,

1540
01:15:50,721 --> 01:15:53,280
Brown power.
Well let's fucking human beings.

1541
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:58,560
As soon as we stopped looking at human 
beings as individuals and we just agree 

1542
01:15:58,881 --> 01:16:02,720
that one group is good and one group is 
bad.

1543
01:16:02,870 --> 01:16:04,730
You've got some real discrimination 
problems.

1544
01:16:04,750 --> 01:16:04,970
Yeah.

1545
01:16:05,250 --> 01:16:10,250
Well you can't win in that way either 
because you can't look whether you side 

1546
01:16:10,250 --> 01:16:10,710
with believe all victims are.
I believe,

1547
01:16:10,860 --> 01:16:12,360
what is it?
I believe women or something like that,

1548
01:16:12,490 --> 01:16:17,490
if there's a Hashtag,
believe women believe so I believe 

1549
01:16:17,490 --> 01:16:17,490
survivors or something like that,
right,

1550
01:16:17,490 --> 01:16:22,400
and then or if you say you want due 
process and women lie and you know that 

1551
01:16:22,801 --> 01:16:27,801
side of the equation,
I think even both sides are equally bad 

1552
01:16:27,801 --> 01:16:27,801
because you're not getting at the truth

1553
01:16:27,801 --> 01:16:32,660
or also in this weird slippery thing 
when it comes to human beings and truth 

1554
01:16:32,660 --> 01:16:35,340
because it's so hard to tell who's 
telling the truth.

1555
01:16:35,670 --> 01:16:40,440
If two people see something or you see a
car accident and one person says,

1556
01:16:40,441 --> 01:16:45,441
well,
this lady ran the red light and slammed 

1557
01:16:45,441 --> 01:16:47,211
into the car,
and then the person right next to it 

1558
01:16:47,211 --> 01:16:47,211
says,
no,

1559
01:16:47,211 --> 01:16:47,970
she didn't.
This other guy ran the red light and she

1560
01:16:47,971 --> 01:16:50,250
hit him and this.

1561
01:16:50,570 --> 01:16:55,570
There's a lot of subjectivity in terms 
of like interpersonal relationships.

1562
01:16:55,810 --> 01:17:00,810
Well,
there's also a problem with just 

1563
01:17:00,810 --> 01:17:00,810
describing things and language.
In reality.

1564
01:17:00,810 --> 01:17:05,250
It's hot.
I don't know if you're telling the 

1565
01:17:05,250 --> 01:17:06,871
truth.
I don't know mean especially if it's 

1566
01:17:06,871 --> 01:17:06,871
just like,
you know,

1567
01:17:06,871 --> 01:17:06,910
I,
I leave,

1568
01:17:06,911 --> 01:17:09,590
I go to the bathroom,
I come back and Jamie says she,

1569
01:17:09,620 --> 01:17:12,530
she just call me a piece of shit and 
you're like,

1570
01:17:12,531 --> 01:17:13,440
no,
I didn't like,

1571
01:17:13,490 --> 01:17:14,480
okay,
well who's right?

1572
01:17:14,570 --> 01:17:15,980
I don't know.
I don't,

1573
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:21,040
I literally don't have a mechanism to 
detect who said what it is not possible.

1574
01:17:21,620 --> 01:17:26,620
Yeah.
So am I just going to believe women or 

1575
01:17:26,620 --> 01:17:30,101
am I going to believe the individual or 
am I going to try to like figure this 

1576
01:17:30,101 --> 01:17:30,620
out?
Am I going to do my detective work?

1577
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:32,360
Fuck.
It's very tricky.

1578
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:37,440
So when you're dealing with some certain
accusations when it comes to human 

1579
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:37,970
beings like this,
Chris hardwick things,

1580
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:39,290
a perfect example of that.

1581
01:17:39,290 --> 01:17:43,090
I mean he was just reinstated yesterday 
by AMC and um,

1582
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:48,640
yeah,
that's a weird one because she wrote 

1583
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:51,881
the,
it was an ex girlfriend that wrote 

1584
01:17:51,881 --> 01:17:51,881
something about him.
Yeah.

1585
01:17:51,881 --> 01:17:54,611
I read that most clearly didn't tell the
truth about some aspects of their 

1586
01:17:54,611 --> 01:17:56,930
relationship.
She cheated on him and that's why he got

1587
01:17:56,931 --> 01:18:01,931
rid of her or broke up with her and then
he or she also said he was just terrible

1588
01:18:02,031 --> 01:18:07,031
boyfriend and he did,
but then there's videos of her talking 

1589
01:18:07,031 --> 01:18:08,570
about what an amazing boyfriend he was 
while they were together,

1590
01:18:08,571 --> 01:18:13,571
about how we stayed with her in the 
hospital and slept by her bed and it's 

1591
01:18:13,571 --> 01:18:13,571
like,
and she's also.

1592
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:18,640
She had a bunch of host of mental 
illnesses that she described in their 

1593
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:23,111
video about like not being able to drive
down the street with the windows open 

1594
01:18:23,111 --> 01:18:26,501
because she was worried that germs are 
going to get in her car and some of 

1595
01:18:26,501 --> 01:18:26,540
those she recovered from and some of 
them she didn't like.

1596
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:30,440
It's an.
There's another problem with people when

1597
01:18:30,441 --> 01:18:32,840
it comes to when they're talking about 
things,

1598
01:18:33,140 --> 01:18:36,060
they might not even be lying.
They just might be.

1599
01:18:36,350 --> 01:18:38,660
They just might have a distorted 
perception of reality.

1600
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:43,960
That is another problem with human 
beings when it comes to any sort of 

1601
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:44,260
interaction between two people,
especially after

1602
01:18:44,330 --> 01:18:49,330
breakup.
I think the way that a person can view 

1603
01:18:49,330 --> 01:18:51,491
the time they spent with someone can 
very much change based on their current 

1604
01:18:51,491 --> 01:18:51,550
situation or how that breakup.

1605
01:18:51,750 --> 01:18:52,980
One hundred percent.
Yeah,

1606
01:18:53,050 --> 01:18:58,050
but on both sides.
The real problem though is what we were 

1607
01:18:58,050 --> 01:19:01,330
saying is that human beings,
it's very difficult.

1608
01:19:01,570 --> 01:19:04,450
I can't read minds.
You can't read minds.

1609
01:19:04,451 --> 01:19:09,451
You can't look into memories.
So we're relying on a person's 

1610
01:19:09,451 --> 01:19:11,650
description and then we have to rely on 
what we know about them,

1611
01:19:11,940 --> 01:19:12,490
what,
how,

1612
01:19:12,540 --> 01:19:13,080
how,
what,

1613
01:19:13,090 --> 01:19:18,090
what,
what we know about their ability to 

1614
01:19:18,090 --> 01:19:20,101
describe things accurately,
what we know about their perceptions of 

1615
01:19:20,101 --> 01:19:21,420
reality are delusions there,
there,

1616
01:19:21,490 --> 01:19:22,120
there,
there,

1617
01:19:22,121 --> 01:19:23,530
there.
Clarity.

1618
01:19:24,110 --> 01:19:26,860
So fucking super tricky.

1619
01:19:26,950 --> 01:19:28,000
Yeah.
I mean,

1620
01:19:28,001 --> 01:19:29,950
my rule of thumb,
what I would say to people is,

1621
01:19:29,951 --> 01:19:34,951
unless you know the two people,
I don't think you can ever really know 

1622
01:19:34,951 --> 01:19:37,651
what happened.
So in that case of say you leave and 

1623
01:19:37,651 --> 01:19:37,651
Jamie tells you,
I said something about you,

1624
01:19:37,651 --> 01:19:38,200
you're probably going to go with Jamie,
right?

1625
01:19:38,201 --> 01:19:38,890
Because you know him.

1626
01:19:40,010 --> 01:19:41,190
Sam is a little crazy.
I might.

1627
01:19:41,500 --> 01:19:43,960
I might go.
Yeah,

1628
01:19:43,961 --> 01:19:48,961
I mean it's for sure if I didn't know 
you and Jamie told me you did something 

1629
01:19:49,421 --> 01:19:51,010
fucked up,
I would side with Jane,

1630
01:19:51,430 --> 01:19:56,410
but even that's weird if I'm not there 
or if I don't know.

1631
01:19:56,710 --> 01:19:58,630
If you say I didn't do anything,
I'm like,

1632
01:19:58,631 --> 01:20:03,631
well maybe one day you'll be my best 
friend and maybe one day Jamie turned 

1633
01:20:03,631 --> 01:20:04,810
out to be a fucking psycho.
I was like,

1634
01:20:04,811 --> 01:20:07,830
remember when we used to think was okay,
he's crazy,

1635
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:08,070
but

1636
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:09,780
that's the thing too.
I think sometimes with.

1637
01:20:09,810 --> 01:20:14,810
I do empathize with some women who say 
if this happens to the men and people 

1638
01:20:14,881 --> 01:20:15,720
say,
well that's a nice guy.

1639
01:20:15,721 --> 01:20:16,800
I know that guy.
That's my buddy.

1640
01:20:16,801 --> 01:20:18,630
I've known him forever,
but you didn't date him,

1641
01:20:18,690 --> 01:20:19,680
so how do you know?

1642
01:20:19,740 --> 01:20:21,090
You don't know,
right?

1643
01:20:21,450 --> 01:20:22,470
Yeah.
You don't know.

1644
01:20:23,300 --> 01:20:25,620
God Damn it.
It's fucking tricky.

1645
01:20:25,700 --> 01:20:28,200
You know,
if you ever seen that episode of black,

1646
01:20:28,230 --> 01:20:29,400
do you ever watch Black Mirror

1647
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:34,840
one episode?
So everyone tells me how amazing this 

1648
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:36,851
show is and I think it is amazing.
But I saw one episode that really 

1649
01:20:36,851 --> 01:20:36,851
freaked me out.
So.

1650
01:20:36,851 --> 01:20:38,360
No,
it was the one about.

1651
01:20:38,660 --> 01:20:43,660
It was actually about a boy who was a 
pedophile and then he was being watched 

1652
01:20:43,660 --> 01:20:45,290
and blackmailed creeped me out.

1653
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:48,690
I didn't watch that one,
but there's one called crocodile.

1654
01:20:48,750 --> 01:20:53,750
Okay.
And it is easily the most disturbing 

1655
01:20:53,750 --> 01:20:56,140
episode of a television show I've ever 
watched in my life and it,

1656
01:20:56,160 --> 01:20:59,250
it has to do with technology that allows
people to read memories.

1657
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:01,440
Okay.
And I'll leave it at that.

1658
01:21:01,470 --> 01:21:06,470
So no spoiler alerts here,
but until it is fucking dark stays with 

1659
01:21:07,921 --> 01:21:10,800
you after this one.
Does this one's dark.

1660
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:12,690
I mean,
I mean I can't,

1661
01:21:12,870 --> 01:21:17,870
I can't,
I will give too much away if I talk 

1662
01:21:17,870 --> 01:21:18,150
about it.
But the concept is that you can,

1663
01:21:18,220 --> 01:21:22,020
they have a machine and they set this 
machine up and through this machine they

1664
01:21:22,021 --> 01:21:27,021
can literally read your memories until 
that happens.

1665
01:21:27,420 --> 01:21:30,480
We really don't know.
And you know,

1666
01:21:30,540 --> 01:21:35,130
there's been things in my life where I 
looked back on it and I had a perception

1667
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:37,680
and then I went to the place where I 
grew up and I was like,

1668
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:38,960
I don't remember it looking like this.

1669
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:41,130
I don't remember this being so close.
Oh,

1670
01:21:41,140 --> 01:21:43,560
the streets right here,
this is where the house is.

1671
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:48,920
Oh,
and then you have to kind of like remap 

1672
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:48,920
your memory.
So like,

1673
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:52,221
okay,
we got to clean these memories up and 

1674
01:21:52,221 --> 01:21:52,221
try to figure out what's accurate and 
what's not.

1675
01:21:52,221 --> 01:21:52,221
But then this,
this,

1676
01:21:52,290 --> 01:21:55,170
I'm just talking about like this,
the neighborhood where I grew up in,

1677
01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:58,170
but what about your adding in emotions?
Then you add again,

1678
01:21:58,230 --> 01:22:03,230
painful emotions because breakups and 
perhaps suicidal thoughts and time going

1679
01:22:04,450 --> 01:22:06,900
by also time.
Sure.

1680
01:22:07,050 --> 01:22:12,050
I mean it's been absolutely proven that 
eye witness testimony is the least 

1681
01:22:12,930 --> 01:22:17,930
accurate piece of evidence that any 
investigator can ever use in terms of 

1682
01:22:18,031 --> 01:22:23,031
like trying to figure out what happened 
at the scene of a crime or anything 

1683
01:22:23,031 --> 01:22:26,700
involving any sort of trauma.
It's fucking hard with people's minds.

1684
01:22:26,790 --> 01:22:29,200
Yeah,
and I mean when we look at say the issue

1685
01:22:29,201 --> 01:22:31,450
with me too in the sexual assault,
sexual harassment,

1686
01:22:31,451 --> 01:22:36,451
that I think also some people see this 
and they think I want to help this 

1687
01:22:36,451 --> 01:22:38,230
person so they might reinterpret their 
situation a way to say,

1688
01:22:38,231 --> 01:22:40,000
you know,
I also want to help this person.

1689
01:22:40,870 --> 01:22:41,770
Well,
I think

1690
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:47,120
there's clearly without doubt,
been a lot of unchecked sexual 

1691
01:22:49,351 --> 01:22:51,820
harassment in the workplace.
Just I,

1692
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:56,900
I've always said this and this is not to
say that men and women shouldn't work 

1693
01:22:56,900 --> 01:22:56,900
together.
Now I'm not saying that any stretch,

1694
01:22:56,900 --> 01:22:58,500
I just want to get that of way really 
quick,

1695
01:22:58,860 --> 01:23:03,860
but when men and women do work together,
they're around each other all day and 

1696
01:23:03,860 --> 01:23:05,830
people are sexually attracted to each 
other and

1697
01:23:06,130 --> 01:23:11,130
men are gross and it's just like this 
guy that I was having this conversation 

1698
01:23:11,201 --> 01:23:12,520
with today,
we're talking about that.

1699
01:23:12,670 --> 01:23:17,670
I was like,
could you imagine being a girl and 

1700
01:23:17,670 --> 01:23:19,291
working in an office and God's trying to
fuck you all the time and there was 

1701
01:23:19,291 --> 01:23:22,231
saying stupid shit to you when you try 
and get coffee and like we were talking 

1702
01:23:22,231 --> 01:23:23,910
about gay guys and he was saying like,
do you ever.

1703
01:23:24,550 --> 01:23:29,550
When he was in the military,
would you have a problem with gay 

1704
01:23:29,550 --> 01:23:29,550
people?
And it was really funny.

1705
01:23:29,550 --> 01:23:30,160
He goes,
he goes,

1706
01:23:30,161 --> 01:23:32,560
I would want to see if I was working 
with a gay guy,

1707
01:23:32,590 --> 01:23:37,590
I'd want them to like me because that 
way he tried to impress me and he'd do 

1708
01:23:37,590 --> 01:23:38,830
his job better and he'd be real nice to 
me and we were laughing about it,

1709
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:39,730
but it was like,
okay,

1710
01:23:39,731 --> 01:23:43,390
that's true,
but if you run a gay guy that was always

1711
01:23:43,391 --> 01:23:48,391
trying to fuck you and like maybe 
touched your ass when you bent over to 

1712
01:23:48,391 --> 01:23:48,391
pick up some paper or something like 
that,

1713
01:23:48,391 --> 01:23:53,341
like that would get real annoying and if
your job relied on this guy liking you 

1714
01:23:54,911 --> 01:23:57,670
and approving you,
which a lot of women's jobs rely on,

1715
01:23:57,671 --> 01:24:01,420
creeps liking them and approving it gets
fucking disgusting.

1716
01:24:01,690 --> 01:24:04,930
That's the reality that many women have 
lived with for decades.

1717
01:24:05,190 --> 01:24:06,250
I know that.
Yeah,

1718
01:24:06,370 --> 01:24:07,930
this is.
This is going to shift.

1719
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:09,660
I'm hoping.
I'm hoping that the.

1720
01:24:10,150 --> 01:24:11,370
Even with the,
the,

1721
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:16,360
the far reaching aspects of it were all 
men are trash.

1722
01:24:17,050 --> 01:24:20,770
I'm hoping it's the Ty's gonna just sort
of settle back in and it's going to,

1723
01:24:20,771 --> 01:24:25,771
instead of being over this way,
it's going to come back over this way 

1724
01:24:25,771 --> 01:24:29,191
and just balance out in the middle of a 
little bit and we'll get a better 

1725
01:24:29,191 --> 01:24:29,191
understanding of each other.

1726
01:24:29,191 --> 01:24:29,610
Yeah,
that's my hope too,

1727
01:24:29,611 --> 01:24:34,611
and I mean I,
I hope that there's not so much damage 

1728
01:24:34,611 --> 01:24:34,611
done that's,
you know,

1729
01:24:34,611 --> 01:24:36,990
fixable at that point because of damage.
Well,

1730
01:24:37,010 --> 01:24:42,010
that you will see.
I feel men nowadays are terrified 

1731
01:24:42,010 --> 01:24:44,430
interact with women,
especially in the workplace.

1732
01:24:44,650 --> 01:24:49,650
I think you should be careful anyway.
I think we're all way too casual about 

1733
01:24:49,650 --> 01:24:53,401
getting intimate with people and I've 
been guilty of it myself and my life at 

1734
01:24:53,401 --> 01:24:57,421
many times,
but I think you should get to know 

1735
01:24:57,421 --> 01:24:57,421
people a little bit better.
The promise people are horny and they're

1736
01:24:57,421 --> 01:24:57,421
like,
ah,

1737
01:24:57,421 --> 01:24:58,300
I get it.
I get you.

1738
01:24:58,301 --> 01:24:59,200
Oh you gave me,
hey,

1739
01:24:59,201 --> 01:25:00,280
let's do this.
You know,

1740
01:25:00,281 --> 01:25:01,690
and that's,
that's a real problem.

1741
01:25:01,691 --> 01:25:06,691
And then you hook up with crazy people 
or you have to keep working with them 

1742
01:25:06,691 --> 01:25:06,691
after.
Yeah.

1743
01:25:06,691 --> 01:25:10,741
That's even worse.
People that have inter office 

1744
01:25:10,741 --> 01:25:10,741
relationships,
I know,

1745
01:25:10,741 --> 01:25:12,340
I know people who work in offices where 
it's tricky,

1746
01:25:12,341 --> 01:25:14,290
forbidden,
like you're not allowed,

1747
01:25:14,291 --> 01:25:16,210
and then and then I'm like,
well,

1748
01:25:16,211 --> 01:25:21,211
okay,
but what if you fall in love with 

1749
01:25:21,211 --> 01:25:23,371
someone in the office or if they're the 
perfect person for you got to quit your 

1750
01:25:23,371 --> 01:25:23,371
job.
Yeah.

1751
01:25:23,371 --> 01:25:27,590
I don't like businesses imposing that.
I think people should be able to make 

1752
01:25:27,590 --> 01:25:31,761
those decisions be tricky.
Decision never date anybody at work and 

1753
01:25:31,761 --> 01:25:33,330
I say that well,
but I don't know.

1754
01:25:33,370 --> 01:25:34,140
Married?
No,

1755
01:25:34,170 --> 01:25:34,770
not married.
Okay.

1756
01:25:35,450 --> 01:25:37,420
You have a boyfriend and no.
Okay.

1757
01:25:38,150 --> 01:25:43,150
What if you met a guy that you worked 
with and he was fucking amazing and he 

1758
01:25:44,661 --> 01:25:49,661
was single and you're single and you 
guys just got along great and he was 

1759
01:25:49,701 --> 01:25:54,701
respectful and he's intelligent.
He's funny and he's interesting and you 

1760
01:25:54,701 --> 01:25:55,070
liked doing things with them.

1761
01:25:55,270 --> 01:25:57,520
There are lots of men in this world.
Who the fuck out of here?

1762
01:25:57,680 --> 01:25:59,530
This is not.
That's not true.

1763
01:25:59,720 --> 01:26:04,720
There are so many men in this world.
Why is it this one person work with is 

1764
01:26:04,720 --> 01:26:05,420
the only one who's going to be a match 
for me.

1765
01:26:05,450 --> 01:26:07,070
He's the only one you've ever met.
It's like that.

1766
01:26:07,250 --> 01:26:08,420
I don't think so.
I mean,

1767
01:26:08,421 --> 01:26:10,160
but the thing is I'm very career 
oriented,

1768
01:26:10,161 --> 01:26:14,180
so that could be part of why in my mind.
Well that's Joel.

1769
01:26:14,260 --> 01:26:19,260
That's a racist.
It's racist to say that Asians are 

1770
01:26:19,260 --> 01:26:19,810
determined,
but in,

1771
01:26:19,811 --> 01:26:24,811
in that way,
I guess I'm a little bit more risk 

1772
01:26:24,811 --> 01:26:26,921
averse.
I'm not gonna jeopardize potentially 

1773
01:26:26,921 --> 01:26:27,110
jeopardize my career over a person that 
I meet that I like.

1774
01:26:27,290 --> 01:26:29,630
What if he was wanting to quit his job?
Well

1775
01:26:31,350 --> 01:26:33,540
then he just did what we could talk,
but we,

1776
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:38,560
I'd be like,
you're gonna you're gonna quit your job 

1777
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:38,560
for a woman.
I don't know.

1778
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:39,450
You fucking loser.
What are you gonna do if we have kids?

1779
01:26:40,060 --> 01:26:40,240
Yeah,

1780
01:26:40,840 --> 01:26:42,380
yeah.
Um,

1781
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:44,530
I see both sides,
but then I see,

1782
01:26:44,531 --> 01:26:49,531
okay,
now imagine being a woman who works in 

1783
01:26:49,531 --> 01:26:50,410
the office with this guy who's in love 
with this woman.

1784
01:26:50,650 --> 01:26:55,650
And then they have a relationship and 
then all of a sudden her career starts 

1785
01:26:55,650 --> 01:26:55,650
doing a little bit better.

1786
01:26:55,650 --> 01:26:56,890
That's the thing.
I know other women will.

1787
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,440
Women like me say,
well wait,

1788
01:26:58,441 --> 01:27:00,480
we're not sleeping with people to get to
the top.

1789
01:27:00,481 --> 01:27:01,500
Is that fair?

1790
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:03,550
Well,
that is the world of the actress.

1791
01:27:04,670 --> 01:27:08,140
It is and that is the world of the 
casting couch and this is the seat.

1792
01:27:08,410 --> 01:27:13,410
This is the not so secret aspect of the 
casting couch that many,

1793
01:27:16,301 --> 01:27:21,301
many,
many people are aware of is that these 

1794
01:27:21,301 --> 01:27:23,821
women,
fuck some of these men and we're not 

1795
01:27:23,821 --> 01:27:26,071
talking about rape.
We're talking about women who chose to 

1796
01:27:26,071 --> 01:27:28,170
engage in willing full sex with people 
who were fractional.

1797
01:27:28,420 --> 01:27:29,530
Yes,
transactional stuff.

1798
01:27:29,531 --> 01:27:30,550
Great.
Great way to put it.

1799
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:36,000
There's a lot of women who I know who 
are actresses who were approached for by

1800
01:27:36,160 --> 01:27:41,160
some certain types of men who were 
producers or executives in certain ways 

1801
01:27:41,160 --> 01:27:45,510
and they've said no,
and then girls that they know said yes 

1802
01:27:45,510 --> 01:27:46,430
and their careers advanced.
Yeah,

1803
01:27:46,750 --> 01:27:49,180
and this was a thing where people were 
aware of it.

1804
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:52,900
It's,
there's a power dynamic that exists when

1805
01:27:52,901 --> 01:27:57,901
there's a boss and then there's an 
underling is a person who's working for 

1806
01:27:58,211 --> 01:28:03,211
that boss and whether it's a a producer 
and an actress or whether it's a CEO and

1807
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:10,040
an employee,
when they engage in some sort of a 

1808
01:28:10,040 --> 01:28:13,120
transactional sexual relationship that 
makes everyone fucking uncomfortable.

1809
01:28:13,121 --> 01:28:13,410
Yeah,

1810
01:28:13,750 --> 01:28:18,750
but how do you stop that you think?
Do you think it's the industry's job or 

1811
01:28:18,750 --> 01:28:19,390
where do you weed that out?

1812
01:28:19,590 --> 01:28:22,170
I think corporations pretty much across 
the board now,

1813
01:28:22,171 --> 01:28:27,171
just fire people when they do that.
There was a recent CEO of some large 

1814
01:28:28,651 --> 01:28:33,651
high profile company who had a step down
because he was involved in a consensual 

1815
01:28:33,651 --> 01:28:35,610
sexual relationship with somebody.
Do you remember who that was?

1816
01:28:35,700 --> 01:28:39,810
It was real big.
Something super recent,

1817
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:41,790
but it was.
There was no crime,

1818
01:28:41,820 --> 01:28:45,180
but it was consensual sexual 
relationship with someone who worked for

1819
01:28:45,181 --> 01:28:47,380
him.
Was it Intel?

1820
01:28:47,390 --> 01:28:48,090
Intel's.
Yeah,

1821
01:28:48,720 --> 01:28:52,020
that people.
They're around each other all day long.

1822
01:28:52,100 --> 01:28:52,830
I like you.
Think about it.

1823
01:28:52,831 --> 01:28:55,980
If you go home,
say if you work eight hours a day and it

1824
01:28:55,981 --> 01:28:57,810
takes you an hour to drive to work an 
hour,

1825
01:28:57,811 --> 01:29:01,320
drive home,
that's fucking 10 hours and nobody eight

1826
01:29:01,321 --> 01:29:02,940
hours a day.
If you really want to make it right,

1827
01:29:02,941 --> 01:29:06,270
you were nine and 10,
so it's like half the day's gone.

1828
01:29:06,630 --> 01:29:08,340
You get home,
you're exhausted,

1829
01:29:08,670 --> 01:29:11,300
you know your husband's exhausts,
you're staring each other,

1830
01:29:11,320 --> 01:29:13,260
you're together like three or four 
hours.

1831
01:29:13,410 --> 01:29:15,810
You have a meal,
you go to sleep,

1832
01:29:16,050 --> 01:29:18,060
you get up in the morning,
you'd go do it again.

1833
01:29:18,061 --> 01:29:23,061
You're with those people at work more 
than you're even with the people that 

1834
01:29:23,061 --> 01:29:24,000
you live with,
you know that's really,

1835
01:29:24,180 --> 01:29:27,510
and that's your waking hours.
By the time you get home,

1836
01:29:27,511 --> 01:29:30,120
you fucking tired and if you go to the 
gym afterwards,

1837
01:29:30,121 --> 01:29:31,950
we'll.
There's an hour and a half gone there.

1838
01:29:32,220 --> 01:29:34,260
You might see each other for an hour a 
night now,

1839
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:39,500
and especially if people are single,
I mean obviously it's a little bit 

1840
01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:39,500
easier for that to happen as well.
Yeah.

1841
01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:43,290
It becomes a big part of your social 
interaction mean how many people there.

1842
01:29:43,620 --> 01:29:47,370
Their social circle is primarily the 
people that they work with.

1843
01:29:48,390 --> 01:29:49,790
Real common,
right?

1844
01:29:51,390 --> 01:29:52,230
So,
I mean,

1845
01:29:52,270 --> 01:29:54,090
I think if it's a consensual 
relationship,

1846
01:29:54,091 --> 01:29:59,091
there shouldn't be anything wrong there,
but I can see how in this climate there 

1847
01:29:59,091 --> 01:30:01,380
are all these other ways of looking at 
it being imposed on it.

1848
01:30:01,380 --> 01:30:04,410
So is that really consensual?
If it's someone who is your boss,

1849
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:07,650
but then imagine say if you and Jamie 
work together.

1850
01:30:07,710 --> 01:30:12,710
Okay.
And you guys had a consensual sexual 

1851
01:30:12,710 --> 01:30:12,720
relationship and you both were on the 
same level.

1852
01:30:12,721 --> 01:30:15,430
You both in does not.
It's not like anybody has any power,

1853
01:30:15,510 --> 01:30:17,880
but then you break up,
you know,

1854
01:30:17,881 --> 01:30:22,881
and then Jamie comes over to me,
he's like a fucking asshole connection 

1855
01:30:23,310 --> 01:30:28,310
and then you come to me and you know,
like Jamie though he looks like a good 

1856
01:30:28,310 --> 01:30:28,310
guy,
but when you start dating him,

1857
01:30:28,310 --> 01:30:32,070
he's a fucking selfish prick.
And then leave that at home.

1858
01:30:32,340 --> 01:30:37,340
Dad.
Well it's definitely becomes a problem 

1859
01:30:37,340 --> 01:30:37,340
in the workforce when you,
you're,

1860
01:30:37,340 --> 01:30:39,390
you're not just friends.
Friends is fine,

1861
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:41,640
but when you start having sex with each 
other,

1862
01:30:41,880 --> 01:30:43,770
that's when things get crazy.
You know?

1863
01:30:43,771 --> 01:30:48,771
Very few people are able to separate sex
and emotions with friendship.

1864
01:30:50,130 --> 01:30:51,810
Very,
very few people.

1865
01:30:51,820 --> 01:30:56,820
That's probably.
That's one of the things that's 

1866
01:30:56,820 --> 01:30:59,481
admirable,
but these people that are willing to 

1867
01:30:59,481 --> 01:30:59,481
have these open relationships,
it's like,

1868
01:30:59,481 --> 01:31:00,240
whoa.
Like you can.

1869
01:31:00,970 --> 01:31:05,670
I know guys like hang out with other 
guys who fuck their girlfriend.

1870
01:31:06,090 --> 01:31:07,080
I'm like,
Jesus,

1871
01:31:07,290 --> 01:31:08,910
you're a better man than me.
Well,

1872
01:31:08,911 --> 01:31:11,460
some of them like that though.
Like if they're masochistic,

1873
01:31:11,461 --> 01:31:15,840
they liked the idea of they're a woman 
being having sex with another guy.

1874
01:31:16,050 --> 01:31:17,490
What you didn't want to use the word 
Cook.

1875
01:31:18,710 --> 01:31:22,710
I like how you went with masochistic.
I guess that's a technical term.

1876
01:31:22,711 --> 01:31:23,850
Two,
we can call them cooks.

1877
01:31:24,690 --> 01:31:27,270
Cook is compromised word though,
isn't it?

1878
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:31,140
There's a whole other stuff that comes 
with that.

1879
01:31:31,170 --> 01:31:32,490
Yeah,
it gets squirrely.

1880
01:31:32,491 --> 01:31:37,491
I thought it always meant that it.
It always meant cuckold like you want to

1881
01:31:37,951 --> 01:31:42,390
watch men have sex with your wife,
but then it got to where.

1882
01:31:42,660 --> 01:31:44,040
What is it?
What is what?

1883
01:31:44,130 --> 01:31:46,990
The.
What is the Beta male?

1884
01:31:46,991 --> 01:31:51,991
The Beta male,
but there's so many different versions 

1885
01:31:51,991 --> 01:31:54,111
of it now.
It's become really freely tossed around 

1886
01:31:54,111 --> 01:31:56,190
like a beach ball at a concert is 
throwing cukor around these days.

1887
01:31:57,200 --> 01:31:59,530
That's fine if that's what you're into.
No judgment there.

1888
01:32:00,850 --> 01:32:02,860
Yeah.
It's into being cuckolded yeah.

1889
01:32:02,861 --> 01:32:05,200
If that's what you're into.
Good luck with that.

1890
01:32:09,670 --> 01:32:14,670
Okay.
Cook a man who is desperate for 

1891
01:32:14,670 --> 01:32:14,670
acceptance,
approval,

1892
01:32:14,670 --> 01:32:14,670
and affection from women.

1893
01:32:14,670 --> 01:32:16,740
Oh,
now it's different.

1894
01:32:17,690 --> 01:32:22,690
This desperation has lead to the 
compromise of his beliefs and values to 

1895
01:32:22,690 --> 01:32:26,420
desecration of his dignity and self 
worth and this inability to stand up for

1896
01:32:26,421 --> 01:32:28,250
himself.
This four Chan,

1897
01:32:28,251 --> 01:32:33,251
right?
This and what he deserves as a human 

1898
01:32:33,251 --> 01:32:33,500
being.
Example,

1899
01:32:33,560 --> 01:32:34,970
loyalty,
fidelity,

1900
01:32:34,971 --> 01:32:37,820
and honesty in a romantic relationship.
Okay.

1901
01:32:39,500 --> 01:32:40,010
Okay.
Look at it.

1902
01:32:40,011 --> 01:32:41,750
Look at the example they gave.
Hold on a second.

1903
01:32:42,110 --> 01:32:44,060
I know John's always wanted a 
girlfriend,

1904
01:32:44,061 --> 01:32:47,210
but since him and Mary started dating,
he's become a cook.

1905
01:32:47,900 --> 01:32:52,900
She spends all of his money and flirts 
openly without openly with other men.

1906
01:32:53,090 --> 01:32:57,140
I can tell it bothers him,
but he's so afraid of losing her that he

1907
01:32:57,141 --> 01:32:59,210
doesn't say anything.

1908
01:33:00,160 --> 01:33:00,820
That's a cook.

1909
01:33:02,130 --> 01:33:06,020
Sounds like a male feminist also.
I can't believe you went there.

1910
01:33:06,470 --> 01:33:08,320
I don't.
Yeah.

1911
01:33:08,330 --> 01:33:10,550
That male feminist thing.
I've,

1912
01:33:10,730 --> 01:33:15,730
I've known a few that were real creeps 
that were fake creeps,

1913
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:17,750
you know,
they're like on the side,

1914
01:33:18,080 --> 01:33:18,780
they,
they,

1915
01:33:18,850 --> 01:33:20,870
what they were doing was there

1916
01:33:22,530 --> 01:33:22,880
there

1917
01:33:23,570 --> 01:33:28,570
posturing as an alternative to these men
who don't want monogamous relationships 

1918
01:33:30,651 --> 01:33:35,651
or would break the woman's heart or not 
willing to compromise and bend to the 

1919
01:33:35,651 --> 01:33:39,521
will of the woman and that they put 
these women on a platform and worship 

1920
01:33:39,521 --> 01:33:43,631
these women and I am the alternative and
I'm the powerful alternative and these 

1921
01:33:43,631 --> 01:33:47,891
men are assholes,
and then they try to shit on those men 

1922
01:33:47,891 --> 01:33:48,590
and take the,
but all it does is make those men appear

1923
01:33:48,591 --> 01:33:51,260
even more attractive to these women.
Secretly.

1924
01:33:51,620 --> 01:33:55,130
These men,
these feminists men and these women have

1925
01:33:56,060 --> 01:34:00,890
these weird relationships where it 
doesn't work and they're never sexual or

1926
01:34:01,260 --> 01:34:06,260
sexual.
The women aren't really sexually 

1927
01:34:06,260 --> 01:34:06,260
attracted to them,
so they withhold sex and it just.

1928
01:34:06,260 --> 01:34:08,120
It gets super weird.
Obviously.

1929
01:34:08,121 --> 01:34:12,020
I just generalized a lot about a giant 
group of people's relationships,

1930
01:34:12,021 --> 01:34:14,470
but what I've seen,
it's just

1931
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:16,740
it's they,

1932
01:34:17,200 --> 01:34:19,540
they don't run fast.
They can't pick things up.

1933
01:34:19,541 --> 01:34:21,240
They're not attractive,
so they tried it.

1934
01:34:21,260 --> 01:34:23,110
They're a little weasels.
They're trying to find another way in.

1935
01:34:23,690 --> 01:34:24,460
Yeah,
I mean,

1936
01:34:24,461 --> 01:34:29,461
I think men who,
not all men who call themselves 

1937
01:34:29,461 --> 01:34:32,851
feminists are male feminists,
so in that I think men who ascribed to 

1938
01:34:33,521 --> 01:34:36,730
women being equal at,
that's a good thing and I think a lot of

1939
01:34:36,731 --> 01:34:37,390
guys will say,
yeah,

1940
01:34:37,391 --> 01:34:39,820
I'm feminists because they think that's 
the right thing to do.

1941
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:43,180
That's the socially acceptable thing and
that's the way we should be.

1942
01:34:43,540 --> 01:34:45,580
But then the ones who run around and 
say,

1943
01:34:46,040 --> 01:34:47,080
you know,
really,

1944
01:34:47,081 --> 01:34:52,081
really push it and make that their 
identity and really sell themselves as 

1945
01:34:52,081 --> 01:34:53,500
male feminists.
Those were the guys I have an issue with

1946
01:34:53,501 --> 01:34:58,501
because like you said,
they're sneaky and they know what 

1947
01:34:58,501 --> 01:34:58,501
they're doing.
They're not being honest.

1948
01:34:58,700 --> 01:35:03,340
Well,
you can almost always tell you,

1949
01:35:03,440 --> 01:35:04,680
you see them,
you know,

1950
01:35:04,840 --> 01:35:06,890
there they're a type,
you know,

1951
01:35:06,891 --> 01:35:08,810
they're just,
they're an unattractive type.

1952
01:35:08,840 --> 01:35:12,860
They're not attractive to women.
And to try to figure out a way like,

1953
01:35:12,861 --> 01:35:15,550
how am I going to do this?
What's it going to be the way you've got

1954
01:35:15,551 --> 01:35:18,990
to figure out a way to stand out.
This is the way I'm going to just what?

1955
01:35:19,030 --> 01:35:20,600
What are these women want to hear?
They want to hear that.

1956
01:35:20,630 --> 01:35:23,360
I'm going to say that egalitarian.
Great.

1957
01:35:23,390 --> 01:35:28,390
You know,
someone who believes in equality is 

1958
01:35:28,390 --> 01:35:30,701
great,
but as soon as you establish your 

1959
01:35:30,701 --> 01:35:33,760
proclaiming yourself to be more 
interested in the opposite gender and 

1960
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:40,600
more supportive of them,
then males and even though you are a 

1961
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:41,290
male,
hm.

1962
01:35:41,450 --> 01:35:44,060
That should be a red flag.
That's a giant red flag.

1963
01:35:44,150 --> 01:35:46,970
You should be into humans.
I like people.

1964
01:35:47,360 --> 01:35:49,520
I like people I like.
I'm gay.

1965
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:51,470
Like I'm straight.
I like people.

1966
01:35:51,680 --> 01:35:53,750
I like when they're Nice,
nice to me.

1967
01:35:53,751 --> 01:35:55,190
I'm nice to you.
That's what I like.

1968
01:35:55,430 --> 01:35:57,500
I don't want you to get discriminated 
against in any way,

1969
01:35:57,501 --> 01:36:02,501
shape or form,
but I don't want to pretend that one 

1970
01:36:02,501 --> 01:36:03,260
group is better than other groups except
Asians when it comes to Harvard.

1971
01:36:04,130 --> 01:36:05,720
The crazy thing is with these guys 
though,

1972
01:36:05,721 --> 01:36:10,721
you see there's been a trend where they 
actually have a lot to hide and they 

1973
01:36:10,721 --> 01:36:12,110
usually are misogynistic and they 
usually do abuse.

1974
01:36:12,111 --> 01:36:17,111
Women was the scary thing.
I think what happens is there's a 

1975
01:36:17,111 --> 01:36:21,251
certain amount of resentment that from 
living this fake life and having these 

1976
01:36:22,971 --> 01:36:26,120
fake beliefs and doing so just to get 
through the approval of women,

1977
01:36:26,620 --> 01:36:28,460
you know,
and then when it doesn't work out,

1978
01:36:28,490 --> 01:36:29,900
there's anger,
resentment,

1979
01:36:29,901 --> 01:36:31,250
and this is just.

1980
01:36:32,390 --> 01:36:37,390
I think some guys put it on because it's
a way of overcompensating for their own 

1981
01:36:37,390 --> 01:36:37,550
guilt.
Yeah,

1982
01:36:37,551 --> 01:36:38,720
that's true too.
Probably.

1983
01:36:38,810 --> 01:36:43,810
Yeah.
There's probably a lot of different 

1984
01:36:43,810 --> 01:36:43,810
reasons why men become feminists and 
very few of them are good unless they're

1985
01:36:43,810 --> 01:36:46,880
just.
Their idea of what it means is different

1986
01:36:46,881 --> 01:36:48,530
than my idea what it means.
My idea.

1987
01:36:48,531 --> 01:36:50,480
It means a little bit,
that little sneaky fuck.

1988
01:36:50,900 --> 01:36:52,490
That's my idea.
You know when I.

1989
01:36:52,670 --> 01:36:55,370
Because I've just seen so many of them,
it's like,

1990
01:36:55,880 --> 01:37:00,880
look,
I'm sure some bank robbers are really 

1991
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:03,821
romantic,
interesting poets who just decide this 

1992
01:37:03,821 --> 01:37:04,070
is a great way to make money.
There's got to be one,

1993
01:37:04,760 --> 01:37:07,250
you know,
but most of them are fucking criminals.

1994
01:37:07,640 --> 01:37:12,640
Right.
And this is like how I feel about male 

1995
01:37:12,640 --> 01:37:14,861
feminists.
Like I'm sure there's a bunch of them 

1996
01:37:14,861 --> 01:37:17,501
out there that are really good guys and 
maybe through the influence of the 

1997
01:37:17,501 --> 01:37:22,121
people that have been around,
they've chosen to identify as a male 

1998
01:37:22,121 --> 01:37:25,340
feminist and this seems to be a good way
to show that they support women and even

1999
01:37:25,341 --> 01:37:30,341
if they have to support women over men,
look at women have been fucked over for 

2000
01:37:30,341 --> 01:37:30,530
so long.

2001
01:37:30,530 --> 01:37:33,170
I'm more than willing to do that and 
they do it with good intentions.

2002
01:37:33,230 --> 01:37:38,230
That's entirely possible,
but a lot of it are creepy little dudes 

2003
01:37:38,230 --> 01:37:40,520
that are trying to get laid and they 
they're not attractive to women,

2004
01:37:40,550 --> 01:37:45,550
so they try to figure out a way to 
become attractive to women and they 

2005
01:37:45,550 --> 01:37:45,560
don't have the confidence to just go,
well,

2006
01:37:45,561 --> 01:37:48,290
aren't we all equal?
Aren't we all just all humans are.

2007
01:37:48,291 --> 01:37:53,291
We're all different.
We're working on yourself to make 

2008
01:37:53,291 --> 01:37:53,291
yourself more attractive to it instead 
of deceiving them.

2009
01:37:53,420 --> 01:37:56,430
One of my all time favorite tweets that 
I read was the guy saying,

2010
01:37:56,460 --> 01:38:01,460
I'm not going to describe myself as a 
feminist until women tell me that I'm 

2011
01:38:01,460 --> 01:38:04,791
doing feminism correctly.
He's like more feminist than regular 

2012
01:38:05,230 --> 01:38:06,420
feminists.
He's like,

2013
01:38:06,421 --> 01:38:10,560
so feminist,
you can't be a feminist to women.

2014
01:38:10,561 --> 01:38:14,340
Tell me I'm a feminist mistress,
Mr [inaudible],

2015
01:38:14,370 --> 01:38:15,120
please tell me.
He's.

2016
01:38:15,330 --> 01:38:17,370
That dude has got a ball gag on right 
now.

2017
01:38:17,371 --> 01:38:18,810
He's like tightening a down.

2018
01:38:21,810 --> 01:38:26,810
He's putting himself in the shack also,
but then there's women like that too.

2019
01:38:28,710 --> 01:38:33,710
There's women that pretend to be one of 
the guys like that girl is always the 

2020
01:38:33,710 --> 01:38:37,971
one of the guy's girl it though other 
guys can tell when a male,

2021
01:38:38,820 --> 01:38:43,820
when a guy's not sincere about being a 
male feminist and the same with girls 

2022
01:38:43,820 --> 01:38:43,820
can tell.
Oh yeah,

2023
01:38:43,830 --> 01:38:47,940
you know the big red flag with girls,
girls who don't have girlfriends,

2024
01:38:49,260 --> 01:38:51,750
they're just friends with guys.
I get along with guys better.

2025
01:38:51,960 --> 01:38:52,850
Yeah,
but you do.

2026
01:38:55,920 --> 01:38:59,470
I had a friend of mine who's,
who's dating a girl like that and she.

2027
01:39:00,120 --> 01:39:03,030
All she had was male friends.
I was like,

2028
01:39:03,031 --> 01:39:05,400
dude,
I'm like,

2029
01:39:05,401 --> 01:39:09,330
get out now.
Like this is not gonna work.

2030
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:12,420
So tell me what does that mean?
Girls don't like?

2031
01:39:12,421 --> 01:39:15,750
Her girls don't trust or you can't find 
any girls.

2032
01:39:15,751 --> 01:39:17,160
Yeah,
that's crazy.

2033
01:39:17,630 --> 01:39:22,630
That is crazy.
I'm not saying you shouldn't have some 

2034
01:39:22,630 --> 01:39:22,770
guy friends,
but all your friends are guys.

2035
01:39:22,771 --> 01:39:24,360
Yeah,
that's a red flag.

2036
01:39:24,420 --> 01:39:25,500
No,
I would agree with that.

2037
01:39:25,590 --> 01:39:30,590
And any guy,
you have a straight guy and all his 

2038
01:39:30,590 --> 01:39:32,370
friends are girls know a fuck is 
happening.

2039
01:39:33,630 --> 01:39:35,490
Right?
We just don't get along with guys.

2040
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:40,520
Guys are assholes.
I don't like the where they talk about 

2041
01:39:40,520 --> 01:39:40,520
women.
Oh,

2042
01:39:40,520 --> 01:39:40,590
okay.
All of them.

2043
01:39:41,130 --> 01:39:43,230
All of them do.
Come on.

2044
01:39:43,450 --> 01:39:46,810
Where are you hanging out dude?
You don't like any guys.

2045
01:39:48,210 --> 01:39:50,100
Seems Weird.
So what did your friend do?

2046
01:39:50,670 --> 01:39:52,200
Oh,
he got fucked around on.

2047
01:39:52,550 --> 01:39:55,260
Yeah,
she was fucking all those guys.

2048
01:39:55,700 --> 01:40:00,700
I was going to say,
of course mean the writing's on the 

2049
01:40:01,051 --> 01:40:02,380
wall.
Yeah.

2050
01:40:02,430 --> 01:40:05,190
It was ugly to the way it went down.
It's like woo.

2051
01:40:06,090 --> 01:40:08,620
But that's how it is.
People.

2052
01:40:09,760 --> 01:40:12,010
People are always trying to find their 
way in like,

2053
01:40:12,030 --> 01:40:17,030
what's what's,
what's my way to get the most 

2054
01:40:17,030 --> 01:40:17,100
acceptance,
my way to get the most happiness my way.

2055
01:40:17,340 --> 01:40:20,100
And I mean,
it's fairly unrelated,

2056
01:40:20,101 --> 01:40:22,430
but not necessarily to what we're 
talking about,

2057
01:40:22,440 --> 01:40:27,440
about gender dysphoria,
about some people choosing that as a 

2058
01:40:27,440 --> 01:40:29,580
path to get a lot of attention.
I mean,

2059
01:40:29,581 --> 01:40:32,670
I think there's many things that people 
do to get a lot of attention.

2060
01:40:32,671 --> 01:40:35,340
There's things that people do to stand 
out as typically unique,

2061
01:40:35,520 --> 01:40:40,520
right?
Like dye their hair pink or purple or 

2062
01:40:40,520 --> 01:40:43,251
blue or wear certain things or do 
certain piercings and just things that 

2063
01:40:43,291 --> 01:40:48,291
people do to like get attention and fit 
in and find their niche and just do 

2064
01:40:49,351 --> 01:40:54,190
something where it makes them feel like 
they have some clout in this community

2065
01:40:54,190 --> 01:40:54,880
of humans.

2066
01:40:55,010 --> 01:41:00,010
Yeah.
It helps them find other people too who 

2067
01:41:00,010 --> 01:41:00,010
are like them.
Yeah.

2068
01:41:00,010 --> 01:41:00,010
Yeah.

2069
01:41:00,010 --> 01:41:00,010
And also like,
it's,

2070
01:41:00,020 --> 01:41:02,570
they're signaling to each other,
we're all equal.

2071
01:41:02,571 --> 01:41:04,250
We're,
or we're all similar.

2072
01:41:04,251 --> 01:41:06,320
We're all,
we're all in this kind of clan.

2073
01:41:06,321 --> 01:41:07,340
We're outsiders,

2074
01:41:07,880 --> 01:41:09,810
you know,
it's fascinating.

2075
01:41:09,990 --> 01:41:14,990
And I'm all for that.
I'm all for people finding each other 

2076
01:41:14,990 --> 01:41:17,631
and self expression.
It's only when it is having negative 

2077
01:41:17,631 --> 01:41:18,360
implications for other people,
that's when it's a problem.

2078
01:41:18,510 --> 01:41:19,230
Oh,
for sure.

2079
01:41:19,260 --> 01:41:20,450
Yeah.
Yeah.

2080
01:41:20,460 --> 01:41:20,820
That's,

2081
01:41:21,980 --> 01:41:22,670
yeah.
When,

2082
01:41:22,730 --> 01:41:25,790
when it's not just a bunch of people 
finding each other,

2083
01:41:26,030 --> 01:41:31,030
but a bunch of people looking at the 
other people and attacking them for not 

2084
01:41:31,341 --> 01:41:36,341
being similar,
but that's one of the things people do 

2085
01:41:36,341 --> 01:41:36,830
to sort of affirm their identity,
right?

2086
01:41:37,340 --> 01:41:39,360
You attack the people that oppose that 
identity or

2087
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:42,170
people that are different to people need
to do that though.

2088
01:41:42,171 --> 01:41:44,590
I wish they didn't,
but they do so often

2089
01:41:45,170 --> 01:41:50,170
wonder like objectively,
if you were from another planet and you 

2090
01:41:50,170 --> 01:41:50,710
were watching these patterns take place.
Here you go,

2091
01:41:50,711 --> 01:41:55,711
wow.
This creepy little organism like this 

2092
01:41:55,711 --> 01:41:55,711
weird thing that it does.

2093
01:41:55,711 --> 01:41:56,790
Yeah.
Going back to the transgender,

2094
01:41:56,791 --> 01:41:57,990
uh,
bullying.

2095
01:41:57,991 --> 01:42:00,360
I guess my issue with,
uh,

2096
01:42:00,630 --> 01:42:03,990
with all of that intimidation is the 
fact that these kids are not getting the

2097
01:42:03,991 --> 01:42:08,991
help that they need.
And so if we look at something like I 

2098
01:42:08,991 --> 01:42:10,380
was saying earlier about if it's a 
little boy who says he's a girl,

2099
01:42:10,620 --> 01:42:13,020
he's likely going to grow up to be a gay
man.

2100
01:42:13,290 --> 01:42:18,290
You can't say that now.
And so all of the scientific research 

2101
01:42:18,290 --> 01:42:19,590
suggests that all the studies ever done 
suggest that.

2102
01:42:19,890 --> 01:42:24,890
But you can't say that because it really
upsets transgender activists and so you 

2103
01:42:24,890 --> 01:42:26,640
have all these children now are 
transitioning who I think in five,

2104
01:42:26,641 --> 01:42:30,760
10 years are going to regret it.
Isn't this sort of similar to what we're

2105
01:42:30,780 --> 01:42:34,260
talking about earlier is that 
historically

2106
01:42:35,320 --> 01:42:40,320
trans people have been so discriminated 
against that it shifted so hard the 

2107
01:42:42,541 --> 01:42:47,541
other way that it's gone the other way,
like just when we were talking about in 

2108
01:42:47,541 --> 01:42:50,841
terms of sexism and harassment in the 
workplace and sexual harassment and 

2109
01:42:50,841 --> 01:42:55,331
rape,
so was so one sided that now it's 

2110
01:42:55,331 --> 01:42:59,601
pushing the opposite way.
Like I read a tweet once by this woman 

2111
01:42:59,601 --> 01:43:00,000
had said,
here's an unpopular opinion,

2112
01:43:00,001 --> 01:43:02,430
and she was an editor of a magazine.
Sure.

2113
01:43:02,431 --> 01:43:06,300
Here's an unpopular opinion.
I'm not even remotely concerned with men

2114
01:43:06,301 --> 01:43:11,301
being falsely accused of sexual 
harassment or assault and she was 

2115
01:43:11,301 --> 01:43:15,710
attacked.
Bret Weinstein retweeted it and pointed 

2116
01:43:15,710 --> 01:43:20,271
out how wrong this idea was and how 
crazy it is to to take allies who are 

2117
01:43:20,491 --> 01:43:25,491
falsely accused of sexual harassment or 
assault and not being concerned about 

2118
01:43:25,491 --> 01:43:26,030
that.
Like you're,

2119
01:43:26,040 --> 01:43:28,830
you're only concerned with your own 
gender and this is a.

2120
01:43:29,020 --> 01:43:34,020
This is a perfect example of an 
intelligent person that's thinking in 

2121
01:43:34,020 --> 01:43:37,080
this really crazy,
discriminatory way because in her mind,

2122
01:43:37,200 --> 01:43:42,200
her team had been fucked over so many 
times that it's time to fuck over that 

2123
01:43:42,200 --> 01:43:44,070
other team.
If we lose a couple of people,

2124
01:43:44,071 --> 01:43:46,440
hey,
we shoot some drones into some apartment

2125
01:43:46,441 --> 01:43:49,530
buildings and a few civilians die.
At least we got the terrorists.

2126
01:43:50,830 --> 01:43:52,160
Yeah,
and I mean I understand

2127
01:43:52,160 --> 01:43:54,320
that like the anger that comes with 
that.

2128
01:43:54,321 --> 01:43:56,090
I think for the people who were the most
militant,

2129
01:43:56,091 --> 01:43:58,430
so not to say that have this particular 
person,

2130
01:43:58,431 --> 01:44:03,431
but I think of women in particular who 
are the most militant about this 

2131
01:44:03,431 --> 01:44:06,581
movement.
I think they really just have been hurt 

2132
01:44:06,581 --> 01:44:06,650
badly by men and it's a way for them to 
express that,

2133
01:44:06,990 --> 01:44:11,170
but you can't say that no.
These women that are angry about men,

2134
01:44:11,620 --> 01:44:16,620
that they've been hurt by men,
so now they discriminate against large 

2135
01:44:16,620 --> 01:44:19,600
groups of men because of that pain.
If you do that,

2136
01:44:19,601 --> 01:44:22,220
like you're.
You're a self hate or your.

2137
01:44:22,270 --> 01:44:23,830
Yeah,
internalized misogyny,

2138
01:44:25,090 --> 01:44:26,830
which is sad.
I mean,

2139
01:44:26,860 --> 01:44:28,270
but you can't actually argue with it.

2140
01:44:30,390 --> 01:44:35,390
Where does this balance out though?
Does it balance out to a point in our 

2141
01:44:35,390 --> 01:44:40,101
children's future,
our children's Children's future where 

2142
01:44:40,101 --> 01:44:43,581
this is no longer a concern,
like cannibalism is no longer a concern 

2143
01:44:43,581 --> 01:44:48,260
or a very,
very slight concern where it's an 

2144
01:44:48,260 --> 01:44:48,260
aberration,
where it's a very,

2145
01:44:48,260 --> 01:44:52,320
very rare thing.
I mean is that's the ultimate goal,

2146
01:44:52,321 --> 01:44:57,321
right?
Is that we reach a point in our society 

2147
01:44:57,321 --> 01:44:58,410
where we do not care if someone's gay,
we got care.

2148
01:44:58,411 --> 01:45:01,680
If you're a girl,
we do not care if you're a boy and we're

2149
01:45:01,681 --> 01:45:06,681
not mad if you're not attracted to us or
I mean that would be a wonderful thing,

2150
01:45:07,171 --> 01:45:12,171
right?
If we get to a point where people are 

2151
01:45:12,171 --> 01:45:12,171
just comfortable in their own skin,

2152
01:45:12,670 --> 01:45:17,670
you mean this craziness,
like where is it eventually going to 

2153
01:45:17,670 --> 01:45:17,670
leave?

2154
01:45:17,670 --> 01:45:17,670
Yes.
I mean culturally across the board,

2155
01:45:17,670 --> 01:45:20,660
whether it's male versus female,
whether it's transverse a straight,

2156
01:45:20,990 --> 01:45:25,990
all of this gay versus straight.
Whether it's progressive versus 

2157
01:45:25,990 --> 01:45:30,610
conservative.
I would love it if we got to this point 

2158
01:45:30,610 --> 01:45:34,220
with all this chaos and calamity and 
arguing back and forth.

2159
01:45:34,250 --> 01:45:37,370
It would be fantastic if we can get to a
balance point.

2160
01:45:37,540 --> 01:45:38,050
Yeah.
No,

2161
01:45:38,051 --> 01:45:43,051
I agree and I do think we're coming up 
to that point because more and more I 

2162
01:45:43,051 --> 01:45:47,011
see people are saying that they're not 
okay with this in terms of the things I 

2163
01:45:47,201 --> 01:45:48,670
write about.
People reach out to me and say,

2164
01:45:48,671 --> 01:45:50,170
you know what?
I'm so glad you said that.

2165
01:45:50,500 --> 01:45:53,140
I agree with you.
Even the response to wrong speak.

2166
01:45:53,141 --> 01:45:58,141
I really thought that people were going 
to lose their minds in terms of the 

2167
01:45:58,141 --> 01:45:58,141
things that we said,
but you know,

2168
01:45:58,141 --> 01:46:02,670
it's been very positive feedback.
So I think more people then you might 

2169
01:46:02,670 --> 01:46:06,200
think are actually on board with,
you know,

2170
01:46:06,460 --> 01:46:09,040
wanting to come to a middle ground and 
they're not okay with this.

2171
01:46:09,100 --> 01:46:12,820
The extreme craziness that we're seeing.
So I think that's a good sign.

2172
01:46:12,850 --> 01:46:14,290
It's just a matter of waiting it out.

2173
01:46:15,020 --> 01:46:20,020
I hope you're right.
And I hope that we understand why things

2174
01:46:20,451 --> 01:46:25,451
get extreme and that as human beings we 
can look at it with compassion and say 

2175
01:46:25,850 --> 01:46:29,600
like you were saying like women that are
so angry against men,

2176
01:46:30,370 --> 01:46:34,370
it's not just because for no reason 
something had to happen to them.

2177
01:46:34,680 --> 01:46:39,290
Like I had a friend and who's not an 
attractive man,

2178
01:46:39,710 --> 01:46:44,710
and over the time that I knew him,
he became more and more resentful to 

2179
01:46:44,931 --> 01:46:49,931
women to the point where he would just 
openly say fucked up misogynistic

2180
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:53,640
things about women.
And it was weird to watch,

2181
01:46:53,641 --> 01:46:58,641
but it was,
it was one of those things where I was 

2182
01:46:58,641 --> 01:46:58,641
like,
oh,

2183
01:46:58,641 --> 01:47:00,951
I see he associates women with paint in.
He associates them with just wanting his

2184
01:47:02,041 --> 01:47:05,490
money or trying to fuck him over and 
this is his perception.

2185
01:47:05,491 --> 01:47:07,530
This is how he looks at women.
Like,

2186
01:47:07,531 --> 01:47:08,190
oh,
okay,

2187
01:47:08,280 --> 01:47:10,470
I get it.
Which is sad,

2188
01:47:10,471 --> 01:47:11,460
you know?
And in that case,

2189
01:47:11,940 --> 01:47:13,680
women obviously not all women are like 
that.

2190
01:47:13,681 --> 01:47:17,340
Just like not all men are the men that 
these women have encountered in life.

2191
01:47:17,341 --> 01:47:20,100
And you can't generalize from one person
to everybody.

2192
01:47:21,150 --> 01:47:22,050
No,
you can't.

2193
01:47:22,080 --> 01:47:27,080
But when we look at it with compassion,
I mean the hopefully the healthy people,

2194
01:47:28,590 --> 01:47:32,790
the people that aren't in that state of 
anger and resentment,

2195
01:47:33,330 --> 01:47:35,430
that they look at it with compassion.
They go,

2196
01:47:35,490 --> 01:47:36,390
oh,
okay,

2197
01:47:36,391 --> 01:47:38,550
I see why this woman would write that 
tweet.

2198
01:47:39,230 --> 01:47:42,840
She's met a bunch of fucked up shitty 
dudes,

2199
01:47:42,930 --> 01:47:45,100
probably male feminists,
right?

2200
01:47:45,240 --> 01:47:50,240
Yeah.
And that she doesn't need to be mobbed 

2201
01:47:50,240 --> 01:47:50,240
over her tweet either

2202
01:47:50,240 --> 01:47:50,240
trust.
No men.

2203
01:47:50,240 --> 01:47:50,620
Yeah,
or man.

2204
01:47:51,330 --> 01:47:52,500
Yeah.
That kind of shit.

2205
01:47:52,740 --> 01:47:53,400
It's like,
okay,

2206
01:47:53,401 --> 01:47:54,810
I get,
I get where that's from.

2207
01:47:56,060 --> 01:47:58,500
I just think there's entirely too much 
conflict out there,

2208
01:47:59,910 --> 01:48:00,210
but

2209
01:48:00,430 --> 01:48:05,430
you know,
I think our society almost thrives on 

2210
01:48:05,430 --> 01:48:05,430
it.
I would say the media definitely thrives

2211
01:48:05,430 --> 01:48:07,750
on it because if you're not angry and 
upset about something,

2212
01:48:08,260 --> 01:48:10,960
what are people going to do mean?
Look at twitter,

2213
01:48:11,690 --> 01:48:14,950
social media to facebook's the best 
because facebook,

2214
01:48:14,951 --> 01:48:18,870
those assholes are allowed to write 
fucking forever wraps,

2215
01:48:19,420 --> 01:48:21,070
paragraphs of bullshit,
like swear.

2216
01:48:21,071 --> 01:48:24,180
Do they have jobs?
Some of these people I click on,

2217
01:48:24,190 --> 01:48:27,940
the more you click on the more thing and
then there's way more,

2218
01:48:27,970 --> 01:48:32,970
way too much.
I think there's just going to be a two 

2219
01:48:32,970 --> 01:48:32,970
lines,
but it's like six pages.

2220
01:48:32,970 --> 01:48:32,970
Yeah.
I think that,

2221
01:48:32,970 --> 01:48:33,100
that,

2222
01:48:33,430 --> 01:48:38,430
that is a real problem and I think one 
of the more unique things about twitter 

2223
01:48:38,430 --> 01:48:40,870
is that it limited you to 140 characters
and then people complained.

2224
01:48:40,871 --> 01:48:41,950
So they gave you to 80.

2225
01:48:42,420 --> 01:48:43,430
No,
that's too much.

2226
01:48:43,431 --> 01:48:47,090
Sometimes I can't read all that.
Sorry.

2227
01:48:47,210 --> 01:48:47,890
It was.
Well,

2228
01:48:47,900 --> 01:48:48,860
as a comic,

2229
01:48:48,940 --> 01:48:52,750
1:40
was great because it made you really,

2230
01:48:52,751 --> 01:48:55,660
um,
it made you really invest in the economy

2231
01:48:55,661 --> 01:48:57,580
of words.
You really had to make sure that you got

2232
01:48:57,581 --> 01:49:02,581
your point out as quickly as possible.
It's great for joke writing because you 

2233
01:49:02,581 --> 01:49:02,990
can just set a Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh 
Duh Duh Duh Duh.

2234
01:49:03,290 --> 01:49:06,880
It's the,
it's a good way to like really trim down

2235
01:49:06,881 --> 01:49:11,881
the fat and your jokes,
but it's not a good way to express 

2236
01:49:11,881 --> 01:49:15,571
ideas.
And that's one of the good things about 

2237
01:49:15,571 --> 01:49:18,241
twitter is they have this thing where 
you can reply to your tweet and then 

2238
01:49:18,241 --> 01:49:19,650
reply to that,
reply to that thread.

2239
01:49:19,750 --> 01:49:22,210
And they all fit in together.
I liked that,

2240
01:49:22,450 --> 01:49:25,810
but I don't like it sometimes because 
sometimes people just fucking drone on.

2241
01:49:26,050 --> 01:49:27,390
Um,
and on and on.

2242
01:49:27,810 --> 01:49:28,900
And this,
you know,

2243
01:49:29,850 --> 01:49:34,850
this is a first draft to edit this shit.
Bitch is too much nonsense in there.

2244
01:49:37,040 --> 01:49:38,680
You don't get that with your dms to 
that.

2245
01:49:38,681 --> 01:49:41,290
People just send you a massive block of.
I don't read them.

2246
01:49:41,330 --> 01:49:41,760
I've,
I've,

2247
01:49:42,090 --> 01:49:44,260
I barely skim through my day.
I can't.

2248
01:49:44,350 --> 01:49:47,980
I follow too many people.
One of the good is I get a

2249
01:49:47,980 --> 01:49:50,680
lot of interesting things in my feed.
One of the bad things.

2250
01:49:50,681 --> 01:49:53,770
I'll get 500 dms a day.
I can't do that.

2251
01:49:54,100 --> 01:49:56,060
I saw someone wrote a tweet that said 
if,

2252
01:49:56,120 --> 01:50:01,120
if my,
if you don't like write two sentences 

2253
01:50:01,120 --> 01:50:01,120
for the DM,
I'm not going to read it.

2254
01:50:01,120 --> 01:50:01,120
And that was their pin tweet.

2255
01:50:02,440 --> 01:50:03,490
Wow.
That's aggressive.

2256
01:50:04,980 --> 01:50:07,620
I read as many as I can.
I just can't read them all.

2257
01:50:07,700 --> 01:50:08,850
There's no way.
Yeah.

2258
01:50:09,070 --> 01:50:14,070
It just,
it's like you can't reply to everybody 

2259
01:50:14,070 --> 01:50:14,070
either.
Like people say,

2260
01:50:14,070 --> 01:50:14,660
welcome your reply to my app mentions I 
can't.

2261
01:50:14,710 --> 01:50:15,730
Yeah.
And you can't like,

2262
01:50:15,731 --> 01:50:17,050
like all of their stuff either.

2263
01:50:17,280 --> 01:50:18,120
No,
it's too many.

2264
01:50:18,180 --> 01:50:20,940
It's too many boss.
I don't want to read people's stuff.

2265
01:50:21,390 --> 01:50:24,240
It's just I don't have.
You don't have the time.

2266
01:50:24,241 --> 01:50:29,241
And also if you're running the risk of 
encountering too much negativity and and

2267
01:50:29,551 --> 01:50:32,350
then also things that you disagree with 
that you want to like,

2268
01:50:32,370 --> 01:50:33,840
oh,
I should say that's bullshit.

2269
01:50:33,841 --> 01:50:36,060
That's not true.
I'm going to tell this guy.

2270
01:50:36,150 --> 01:50:37,620
This is what actually happened.
Yeah.

2271
01:50:37,830 --> 01:50:41,250
You don't even know history.
I don't want to do that.

2272
01:50:41,310 --> 01:50:44,910
I don't want to argue with people about 
random facts or science or anything.

2273
01:50:45,390 --> 01:50:47,250
I'll look at it and I'm like,
okay,

2274
01:50:47,550 --> 01:50:48,000
this is.

2275
01:50:48,900 --> 01:50:50,310
But you've.
Have you been mobbed before?

2276
01:50:50,311 --> 01:50:52,620
You have what's been the worst?

2277
01:50:52,900 --> 01:50:57,900
Oh,
one of the big ones was a about a trans 

2278
01:50:57,900 --> 01:50:57,900
fighter.
I remember that.

2279
01:50:57,900 --> 01:51:02,251
Yeah,
that was a hilarious one because I'm 

2280
01:51:02,251 --> 01:51:02,410
like,
you guys can kiss my fucking ass.

2281
01:51:02,411 --> 01:51:04,960
You're out of your mind.
You guys are out of your mind.

2282
01:51:04,961 --> 01:51:09,961
If you think that a man who has been a 
man for 30 years and has taken female 

2283
01:51:09,961 --> 01:51:13,720
hormones for two is the same.
You put Brock Lesnar,

2284
01:51:13,900 --> 01:51:15,730
chop his dick off and put them in a 
dress.

2285
01:51:15,760 --> 01:51:20,760
That guy's gonna Maul through the 
women's heavyweight division like 

2286
01:51:20,760 --> 01:51:23,761
nothing you've ever seen in your life 
because we're built different and it's 

2287
01:51:23,761 --> 01:51:26,380
just a fact and then they want to tries 
to argue that it's crazy and there are.

2288
01:51:26,700 --> 01:51:31,700
There's certainly standouts in terms of 
women who are a much more muscular,

2289
01:51:33,460 --> 01:51:35,790
higher bone density,
particularly African American women have

2290
01:51:35,800 --> 01:51:40,800
very high bone density,
but there's a different shape to their 

2291
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:40,800
hips.

2292
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:42,820
There's A.
There's the size of the hands,

2293
01:51:42,821 --> 01:51:45,850
the size of the shoulders.
Things are different.

2294
01:51:46,250 --> 01:51:50,320
That also the imprinting of years and 
years of testosterone.

2295
01:51:50,680 --> 01:51:54,490
It's just.
There was a great article by this.

2296
01:51:54,491 --> 01:51:59,350
I'm board certified endocrinologist who 
went over all of the,

2297
01:51:59,590 --> 01:52:04,590
all the things that separate men from 
women which should exclude them from 

2298
01:52:04,590 --> 01:52:09,301
competing in combat sports against women
and this woman was called a transphobic 

2299
01:52:11,340 --> 01:52:13,430
and she's a fucking endocrinologists 
idiot.

2300
01:52:13,431 --> 01:52:16,420
She's talking about the science and 
she's also talking about the science of.

2301
01:52:16,690 --> 01:52:19,240
One of the things they talk about is how
women,

2302
01:52:19,300 --> 01:52:21,070
you know,
or a trans woman.

2303
01:52:21,071 --> 01:52:26,071
Once they transitioned to being a woman 
there basically biologically almost 

2304
01:52:26,071 --> 01:52:26,080
exactly the same as woman.
She was like,

2305
01:52:26,090 --> 01:52:28,000
no,
not only that,

2306
01:52:28,001 --> 01:52:32,410
but the bone density is retained by 
taking estrogen,

2307
01:52:32,590 --> 01:52:36,160
which is what the problem with women 
when they have osteoporosis,

2308
01:52:36,420 --> 01:52:38,650
they they lose.
They're losing estrogen,

2309
01:52:38,651 --> 01:52:40,360
they lose bone mass.
Well,

2310
01:52:40,450 --> 01:52:42,940
the estrogen actually helps you retain 
bone mass,

2311
01:52:42,941 --> 01:52:46,040
so when a man transitions to a woman and
then starts

2312
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:51,040
taking estrogen,
it's actually helping retain the bone 

2313
01:52:51,040 --> 01:52:51,320
mass that he would have lost by not 
having testosterone,

2314
01:52:51,680 --> 01:52:56,680
and then on top of that reaction times 
that Rita reaction times are several 

2315
01:52:56,680 --> 01:53:01,150
tenths of a second faster in general for
women than they are for you or for men 

2316
01:53:01,150 --> 01:53:01,910
rather than they are for even 
professional athlete.

2317
01:53:01,911 --> 01:53:06,911
Women saw these.
All these variables that need to be 

2318
01:53:06,911 --> 01:53:10,811
taken into consideration when you're 
allowing someone to do a sport and that 

2319
01:53:10,811 --> 01:53:11,690
we're not just talking about bike 
racing,

2320
01:53:12,110 --> 01:53:16,230
we're not talking about something where 
someone noncontact.

2321
01:53:16,300 --> 01:53:20,180
We're talking about the most contact.
We're talking about fucking fighting.

2322
01:53:21,850 --> 01:53:24,830
There's there's benefits that certain 
people have.

2323
01:53:25,130 --> 01:53:26,860
There's,
there's physical attributes that pe,

2324
01:53:27,230 --> 01:53:30,180
there's variables inside the genders 
right there.

2325
01:53:30,190 --> 01:53:35,190
There's some men that have gigantic 
physical advantages over other men and 

2326
01:53:36,170 --> 01:53:39,790
all of those are taking into you,
you,

2327
01:53:39,791 --> 01:53:40,670
you,
there's no,

2328
01:53:40,730 --> 01:53:45,100
like even playing field when it comes to
even enter gender competition or,

2329
01:53:45,470 --> 01:53:47,450
or you know,
male versus male competition.

2330
01:53:47,450 --> 01:53:50,720
There's no real level playing field.
So the best we can do is say,

2331
01:53:50,721 --> 01:53:52,750
okay,
well you guys got to be the same weight.

2332
01:53:53,260 --> 01:53:54,290
You know what,
let's just make that,

2333
01:53:54,330 --> 01:53:56,630
make it the same weight and that's as 
close as you can get.

2334
01:53:56,740 --> 01:53:58,340
But,
but even in that,

2335
01:53:58,610 --> 01:54:00,790
there's people that are just physically,
they're just,

2336
01:54:00,830 --> 01:54:02,360
they're just going to be better.
There's no,

2337
01:54:02,390 --> 01:54:05,480
there's no getting around it.
There's going to be better athletes.

2338
01:54:05,710 --> 01:54:07,790
There's,
they're going to have better genetics.

2339
01:54:08,460 --> 01:54:09,860
You know,
there's nothing you do about that.

2340
01:54:10,010 --> 01:54:14,810
But one thing we can do is we can keep 
women from getting beaten up by men and,

2341
01:54:15,050 --> 01:54:18,290
and men who transitioned to being women.
And if you think that's fair,

2342
01:54:18,440 --> 01:54:22,670
you're fucking crazy and it's just not.
It just doesn't make any sense.

2343
01:54:22,760 --> 01:54:27,760
And the arguments for it are so shitty.
And so there are so riddled with 

2344
01:54:27,760 --> 01:54:32,300
progressive speak that they're trying to
pretend that this is a woman.

2345
01:54:32,300 --> 01:54:33,320
Now,
this is not a woman.

2346
01:54:33,560 --> 01:54:35,930
This is a trans woman,
this is a male.

2347
01:54:35,960 --> 01:54:40,280
She has a y chromosome.
She transitioned to being a female.

2348
01:54:40,430 --> 01:54:45,430
Now she's a trans woman,
and if you choose to fight her and 

2349
01:54:45,430 --> 01:54:47,480
you're a woman and you know that she's a
trans woman,

2350
01:54:47,481 --> 01:54:50,660
I'm totally fine with that.
But that was not what was going on here.

2351
01:54:50,750 --> 01:54:55,100
What was going on here was this woman 
who used to be a man for 32 years,

2352
01:54:55,460 --> 01:55:00,460
transitioned to being a woman and it 
didn't tell anybody and thought to 

2353
01:55:00,460 --> 01:55:03,890
different women who thought they were 
fighting a woman and got fucking smashed

2354
01:55:05,360 --> 01:55:10,360
watching it.
It was like watching a man fight a 

2355
01:55:10,360 --> 01:55:10,360
woman.
That's what I was watching.

2356
01:55:10,360 --> 01:55:10,550
I was like,
this isn't like particularly.

2357
01:55:10,551 --> 01:55:15,380
She wasn't particularly skillful.
It wasn't like she had some unbelievable

2358
01:55:15,381 --> 01:55:20,381
background in judo,
like Rhonda Rousey or something like 

2359
01:55:20,381 --> 01:55:20,381
that.

2360
01:55:20,381 --> 01:55:23,440
It wasn't that he would just literally 
watching a former man beat up women who 

2361
01:55:24,711 --> 01:55:29,390
never had the the benefit of 30 years 
plus of testosterone in their body.

2362
01:55:29,720 --> 01:55:31,670
What do you think the solution should be
then?

2363
01:55:31,970 --> 01:55:35,090
I don't know,
but I was fascinated by watching the mob

2364
01:55:35,120 --> 01:55:37,010
come after me for that one.
I was like,

2365
01:55:37,590 --> 01:55:41,280
this is adorable.
What was fascinating about it was,

2366
01:55:42,230 --> 01:55:43,830
here's something I.
I mean,

2367
01:55:43,831 --> 01:55:48,831
I'm not a physio.
I'm not a real expert in physiology or 

2368
01:55:49,260 --> 01:55:54,260
endocrinology,
but I'm a martial arts expert and I've 

2369
01:55:54,260 --> 01:55:56,280
been doing it my whole life.
Like I know the difference I've.

2370
01:55:56,340 --> 01:56:01,340
I've trained with women world champions 
and watch them get mauled by men who are

2371
01:56:03,301 --> 01:56:05,640
not very good.
It's just a fact,

2372
01:56:06,030 --> 01:56:08,250
especially when it comes to striking,
you know,

2373
01:56:08,280 --> 01:56:13,280
there's more of a gap in Jujitsu or the 
gap rather closes in Jujitsu because 

2374
01:56:14,101 --> 01:56:17,820
skill and technique take precedent over 
physical strength,

2375
01:56:18,180 --> 01:56:20,280
but God dammit when it comes to 
striking,

2376
01:56:20,400 --> 01:56:25,400
you could get a man who's been doing it 
for six months but just happens to have 

2377
01:56:25,410 --> 01:56:30,330
a lot of fast twitch muscle fiber and it
just knows how to hit things hard and he

2378
01:56:30,360 --> 01:56:31,500
he'll fuck a woman up.

2379
01:56:31,500 --> 01:56:36,500
It's not good,
especially when it comes to kickboxing 

2380
01:56:36,500 --> 01:56:36,500
and kicking and punching.
There's so.

2381
01:56:36,500 --> 01:56:41,300
There's so many advantages and to to say
that those advantages are immediately 

2382
01:56:41,300 --> 01:56:46,220
cut out of the picture.
As soon as you transitioned to being a 

2383
01:56:46,220 --> 01:56:49,521
woman and within two years he should be 
able to fight women in a cage and not 

2384
01:56:49,521 --> 01:56:49,530
tell them,
you're a woman.

2385
01:56:49,531 --> 01:56:51,180
I was like,
this is insanity.

2386
01:56:51,320 --> 01:56:52,410
Yeah,
so that was the.

2387
01:56:52,430 --> 01:56:56,370
That was the big mob that came after me.
I think it's interesting that in this,

2388
01:56:56,510 --> 01:57:01,510
because it is pitting people who would 
call themselves feminist against 

2389
01:57:01,510 --> 01:57:05,060
transgender activists.
Basically women are being lost in the 

2390
01:57:05,060 --> 01:57:08,571
mix,
so you can't say certain things like on 

2391
01:57:08,571 --> 01:57:10,630
what planet would it be okay for someone
who is born male to fight a woman,

2392
01:57:11,370 --> 01:57:16,370
but in this case,
because this person who was born male 

2393
01:57:16,370 --> 01:57:17,480
identifies as female,
you can't call that into question it and

2394
01:57:17,530 --> 01:57:20,460
it also,
there was a real problem in Texas,

2395
01:57:20,610 --> 01:57:25,610
the other way where they're there,
what they were doing as being prejudice 

2396
01:57:25,981 --> 01:57:30,981
against trans people to the point where 
they wouldn't let a girl transitioning 

2397
01:57:30,981 --> 01:57:32,550
to being a boy wrestle with boys.

2398
01:57:32,790 --> 01:57:36,120
They made her wrestle with girls while 
she was taking testosterone.

2399
01:57:36,420 --> 01:57:41,420
Like,
you guys are out of your fucking mind 

2400
01:57:41,420 --> 01:57:43,580
like you.
You're not even recognizing that she 

2401
01:57:43,580 --> 01:57:46,071
wants to compete with boys,
which is a disadvantage for her or him.

2402
01:57:46,351 --> 01:57:51,210
Now let him compete with boys because 
this is a different thing,

2403
01:57:51,510 --> 01:57:53,970
but then even then a lot of boys are 
saying,

2404
01:57:53,971 --> 01:57:55,800
well look,
I'm not taking testosterone.

2405
01:57:55,801 --> 01:58:00,801
I just have testosterone.
Would have her testosterone is higher 

2406
01:58:00,801 --> 01:58:03,750
than my testosterone because she's 
taking exogenous testosterone.

2407
01:58:03,751 --> 01:58:05,060
This is kind of crazy.
Like,

2408
01:58:05,070 --> 01:58:06,740
yeah,
it's.

2409
01:58:06,780 --> 01:58:09,960
There's a lot of new ground that's going
on here.

2410
01:58:09,990 --> 01:58:14,990
My concern as a martial arts expert is 
when you are using ideology to push 

2411
01:58:19,500 --> 01:58:22,500
this,
this progressive notion that,

2412
01:58:22,530 --> 01:58:27,530
you know,
a trans woman is exactly the same as a 

2413
01:58:27,530 --> 01:58:31,140
woman and you're getting women beat the 
fuck up because of it and this is what I

2414
01:58:31,141 --> 01:58:34,260
felt and this is what I saw and they 
wouldn't have to be hard for like a year

2415
01:58:34,260 --> 01:58:35,400
or two,
but then it all went away.

2416
01:58:35,460 --> 01:58:37,050
What's the worst thing they said about 
you?

2417
01:58:37,610 --> 01:58:39,360
I didn't read it.
I didn't read it.

2418
01:58:39,361 --> 01:58:40,890
I read a little bit of it and then I was
like,

2419
01:58:41,010 --> 01:58:46,010
oh,
I really didn't even hurt my feelings 

2420
01:58:46,010 --> 01:58:46,010
because it was like,
this is so stupid.

2421
01:58:46,010 --> 01:58:49,800
It's like,
do you know a woman who's got a hand 

2422
01:58:49,800 --> 01:58:50,170
that looks like that?
Find one,

2423
01:58:50,530 --> 01:58:52,570
find one.
Because if I took estrogen,

2424
01:58:52,571 --> 01:58:55,000
I'd still have these and that's not 
fair.

2425
01:58:55,080 --> 01:58:56,530
It's just not.
I don't care.

2426
01:58:56,590 --> 01:58:58,300
I don't care what anybody says.
It's just not.

2427
01:58:58,660 --> 01:59:00,220
I mean,
even a woman with big hands,

2428
01:59:00,221 --> 01:59:03,220
they're not that big.
They're not like brock Lesnar's hands is

2429
01:59:03,221 --> 01:59:05,560
that there's a difference.
There's a fucking difference.

2430
01:59:06,010 --> 01:59:07,690
There's a difference in the shape of the
jaw,

2431
01:59:07,700 --> 01:59:12,700
the difference in.
So there's so many differences in men to

2432
01:59:12,761 --> 01:59:17,761
women and there's so many women that 
used to be men that transition to being 

2433
01:59:17,761 --> 01:59:19,360
women that are now dominating these 
sports.

2434
01:59:19,360 --> 01:59:22,780
Are these women feel like they're being 
fucked over like weightlifting.

2435
01:59:22,990 --> 01:59:27,990
There was this Australian weightlifter 
who is a trans woman who's competing as 

2436
01:59:27,990 --> 01:59:30,430
a woman and his fucking breaking records
left and right.

2437
01:59:30,431 --> 01:59:31,810
And everybody's like,
this is crazy.

2438
01:59:31,970 --> 01:59:33,120
She's an inspiration.
Yeah.

2439
01:59:33,280 --> 01:59:34,450
No,
she's a guy.

2440
01:59:35,260 --> 01:59:38,700
She used to be a guy and now she's 
breaking these women's records.

2441
01:59:38,710 --> 01:59:40,090
Like,
what are we doing?

2442
01:59:40,120 --> 01:59:41,370
This is crazy.
Yeah.

2443
01:59:41,740 --> 01:59:46,740
But to play devil's advocate,
please do fox get beaten by Ashley Smith

2444
01:59:49,180 --> 01:59:52,300
because she sucks.
That's really what it is.

2445
01:59:52,330 --> 01:59:53,680
Ashley.
Evan Smith is good.

2446
01:59:54,380 --> 01:59:56,350
She's so good.
She listened.

2447
01:59:56,680 --> 02:00:01,680
There's a lot of women that would be a 
lot of men and women who are not taking 

2448
02:00:02,410 --> 02:00:06,010
anything,
who would beat a lot of men.

2449
02:00:06,190 --> 02:00:11,190
And it's happened.
I'm a Germane to random me who,

2450
02:00:11,621 --> 02:00:14,770
uh,
was a super high level.

2451
02:00:14,830 --> 02:00:19,830
Women's MMA fighter is a 145 pound world
title beat.

2452
02:00:20,170 --> 02:00:23,350
Holly Holm.
She fought a man and a kickboxing bout,

2453
02:00:23,351 --> 02:00:26,260
knocked him out.
It's because she's a fucking beast.

2454
02:00:26,510 --> 02:00:31,510
She's really good and really technical,
super strong and just much better than a

2455
02:00:32,711 --> 02:00:37,360
guy who wasn't on her level,
but she's just super exceptional.

2456
02:00:38,170 --> 02:00:42,540
But there's also women who fought men 
who were world champions who got knocked

2457
02:00:42,541 --> 02:00:44,950
down,
who there was a woman from.

2458
02:00:45,220 --> 02:00:49,930
God Damn it,
she was a female boxer from Holland.

2459
02:00:50,440 --> 02:00:51,760
Her name escapes me right now.
Um,

2460
02:00:51,761 --> 02:00:56,761
she was,
she was a woman that they were always 

2461
02:00:56,761 --> 02:00:58,600
trying to match her up with Christy 
Martin back when Christy Martin,

2462
02:00:58,601 --> 02:01:01,810
the coal miner's daughter was a famous,
God dammit.

2463
02:01:02,050 --> 02:01:07,050
Why can't I remember her name?
But she was an elite female boxer and 

2464
02:01:07,050 --> 02:01:09,220
she got knocked out by a man.
It was ugly.

2465
02:01:09,700 --> 02:01:10,870
And the guy,
she knocked out,

2466
02:01:10,871 --> 02:01:12,940
the guy who knocked her out really 
wasn't very good.

2467
02:01:13,300 --> 02:01:16,630
He just climbed her on the John and 
killed her.

2468
02:01:16,990 --> 02:01:21,990
But it was disturbing to watch,
but somehow wasn't disturbing with 

2469
02:01:21,990 --> 02:01:21,990
Jermaine to random.
He knocked out the guy.

2470
02:01:22,120 --> 02:01:23,110
Then it was like,
yeah,

2471
02:01:23,620 --> 02:01:25,980
girl,
I'm the,

2472
02:01:26,110 --> 02:01:31,110
you can't,
you're always going to have people that 

2473
02:01:31,110 --> 02:01:32,320
are higher level skill and Ashley Evan 
Smith,

2474
02:01:32,321 --> 02:01:37,321
who's competed successfully in the UFC,
she's very tough and she beat Fox and 

2475
02:01:37,931 --> 02:01:39,260
that this,
you know,

2476
02:01:40,250 --> 02:01:45,250
I'm not against fallon,
Fox fighting women that want to fight 

2477
02:01:45,250 --> 02:01:45,250
her.
I'm not against that.

2478
02:01:45,410 --> 02:01:50,410
If they want.
I'm not against women fighting men to 

2479
02:01:50,410 --> 02:01:50,410
want to do.
I'm not a man.

2480
02:01:50,410 --> 02:01:52,670
I'm not against people riding bulls.
I'm not against people bungee jumping.

2481
02:01:52,720 --> 02:01:54,260
I should be able to do whatever fuck you
want,

2482
02:01:54,800 --> 02:01:59,800
but don't pretend that you're exactly 
the same as a biological woman.

2483
02:02:00,310 --> 02:02:02,090
Well,
why the fuck do we have tests?

2484
02:02:02,091 --> 02:02:03,530
Then what?
Why?

2485
02:02:03,560 --> 02:02:04,310
What is it?

2486
02:02:04,430 --> 02:02:06,620
What is a chromosome?
What our genetics,

2487
02:02:06,650 --> 02:02:07,580
what are,
what is it?

2488
02:02:08,030 --> 02:02:11,120
Is it all?
We're just going to give it all away for

2489
02:02:11,121 --> 02:02:12,770
ideology.
And what about women?

2490
02:02:13,140 --> 02:02:18,140
Like what is this idea of being 
completely progressive and and looking 

2491
02:02:18,471 --> 02:02:21,410
at things and promoting equality.
That's wonderful.

2492
02:02:21,411 --> 02:02:23,270
But are you promoting equality for 
women?

2493
02:02:23,620 --> 02:02:25,760
Like what about the women?
What about a woman like you?

2494
02:02:25,790 --> 02:02:29,340
What about a woman who's a slight thin?
What do,

2495
02:02:29,341 --> 02:02:31,610
what are you supposed to do?
How much do you weigh?

2496
02:02:32,030 --> 02:02:34,160
I'm not going to tell you.
You're very sad.

2497
02:02:35,060 --> 02:02:37,720
Let's pretend you're in the hundred and 
five pound weight class.

2498
02:02:38,090 --> 02:02:40,090
Do you feel like you can compete with 
100,

2499
02:02:40,100 --> 02:02:41,690
five pound man and.
No,

2500
02:02:41,720 --> 02:02:43,710
that seems.
That seems ridiculous,

2501
02:02:44,030 --> 02:02:44,990
right?
Well,

2502
02:02:44,991 --> 02:02:49,991
it seems to me that we have to accept 
the fact that there's some physical 

2503
02:02:49,991 --> 02:02:54,701
differences when the consequences are 
being gravely injured and this is what 

2504
02:02:54,741 --> 02:02:55,730
martial arts are all about.

2505
02:02:55,760 --> 02:03:00,760
I'm trying to hurt you and I shouldn't 
have natural physical advantages that 

2506
02:03:00,760 --> 02:03:04,640
come from having a y chromosome and 30 
plus years of testosterone in my body.

2507
02:03:04,850 --> 02:03:08,120
That just seems to be obvious to me and 
I didn't understand why,

2508
02:03:08,360 --> 02:03:11,990
but that was a hill that I was ready to 
die on.

2509
02:03:12,440 --> 02:03:14,120
I was like,
you guys can fuck off.

2510
02:03:14,150 --> 02:03:19,150
Good for you for that,
but you see that they've kind of left 

2511
02:03:19,150 --> 02:03:19,150
you alone now,
right?

2512
02:03:19,150 --> 02:03:22,660
Because I do this because I [inaudible] 
I can say things like this about it and 

2513
02:03:22,660 --> 02:03:25,340
I think because it makes sense because 
when other people hear about it that are

2514
02:03:25,341 --> 02:03:26,450
rational people,
they go,

2515
02:03:26,570 --> 02:03:28,070
what?
What's happening?

2516
02:03:28,700 --> 02:03:29,870
Wait a minute,
that's a guy.

2517
02:03:30,030 --> 02:03:31,410
She was a guy for 30 years.
Like,

2518
02:03:31,430 --> 02:03:35,180
that's not right.
And the vast majority of people who even

2519
02:03:35,181 --> 02:03:40,181
support trans rights,
including friends of mine who are trans 

2520
02:03:40,181 --> 02:03:41,000
or with me on this,
they're like,

2521
02:03:41,001 --> 02:03:41,930
yeah,
that's crazy.

2522
02:03:42,020 --> 02:03:45,470
Have you heard the term turf?
Uh,

2523
02:03:45,560 --> 02:03:47,030
my surf and turf

2524
02:03:47,110 --> 02:03:48,990
terp no.
Turf is in t e R,

2525
02:03:48,991 --> 02:03:51,160
F is trans.
Exclusionary.

2526
02:03:51,161 --> 02:03:56,161
Radical feminist.
So this is a new slur that's being used 

2527
02:03:56,161 --> 02:03:59,581
against women who will say trans women 
or not women because they were not born 

2528
02:04:00,101 --> 02:04:00,490
women,

2529
02:04:02,200 --> 02:04:04,410
trans exclusionary,
radical feminist

2530
02:04:04,880 --> 02:04:08,450
kind of be a turf in this situation 
because you are advocating for women and

2531
02:04:08,451 --> 02:04:12,950
the safety of women and saying that 
people who are born male but identify as

2532
02:04:12,951 --> 02:04:15,920
female are not the same as people who 
are born female.

2533
02:04:16,020 --> 02:04:21,020
Yes.
But that doesn't mean that I'm 

2534
02:04:21,020 --> 02:04:21,020
discriminatory.
No,

2535
02:04:21,490 --> 02:04:24,120
it's a word that they use to try and 
discredit you.

2536
02:04:24,480 --> 02:04:26,400
Good luck,
have fun with that.

2537
02:04:26,610 --> 02:04:30,330
I don't care see this problem,
but the thing about this is I don't care

2538
02:04:30,331 --> 02:04:35,331
because I really don't have any hate in 
my heart and I don't have any 

2539
02:04:35,331 --> 02:04:36,510
discrimination in my heart like I don't 
think most of us do.

2540
02:04:36,540 --> 02:04:38,010
Well,
I speak for everybody.

2541
02:04:38,070 --> 02:04:38,940
Some do,
but

2542
02:04:39,280 --> 02:04:40,270
some do.
I'm sure.

2543
02:04:40,271 --> 02:04:45,271
I'm sure if you were Tryna look,
if you have a thousand people and 100 of

2544
02:04:45,310 --> 02:04:46,960
those people are a fucking asshole to 
you.

2545
02:04:47,260 --> 02:04:49,510
It's gonna feel like a lot of people.
Right?

2546
02:04:49,810 --> 02:04:52,310
So if you're a trans person and you're,
you're.

2547
02:04:52,420 --> 02:04:57,420
I mean,
I've seen horrific things written to 

2548
02:04:57,420 --> 02:04:57,420
trans people online.
I've seen it,

2549
02:04:57,420 --> 02:05:01,470
I've seen,
I understand that it's real 

2550
02:05:01,470 --> 02:05:02,761
discrimination,
but I understand that you have to 

2551
02:05:02,761 --> 02:05:05,131
understand,
you have to appreciate who your actual 

2552
02:05:05,131 --> 02:05:08,551
allies and people who are rational 
people who actually care about you and 

2553
02:05:08,590 --> 02:05:11,980
who disagree with you.
On one very particular thing,

2554
02:05:11,981 --> 02:05:13,990
and this is the only place where I 
disagree,

2555
02:05:14,290 --> 02:05:17,650
it's combat sports and it's because it's
my area of expertise.

2556
02:05:18,130 --> 02:05:21,970
I've been doing it since I was a kid.
Like you can't tell me that there.

2557
02:05:22,160 --> 02:05:27,160
There's not differences.
I've watched men and women fight my 

2558
02:05:27,160 --> 02:05:30,211
whole life.
I know there's a difference and I know 

2559
02:05:30,211 --> 02:05:34,971
that from talking to endocrinologist and
people who are experts in the human 

2560
02:05:35,171 --> 02:05:40,171
anatomy,
that there's just physiological 

2561
02:05:40,171 --> 02:05:40,171
differences that are insurmountable.
You just are.

2562
02:05:40,171 --> 02:05:42,520
I've seen men and women hit the bag.
It's a very different thing.

2563
02:05:42,550 --> 02:05:47,550
Yeah,
I mean I get where people are coming 

2564
02:05:47,550 --> 02:05:47,550
from,
the people who are upset by this because

2565
02:05:47,550 --> 02:05:51,901
I think by acknowledging someone that 
someone was not born the sex that they 

2566
02:05:51,901 --> 02:05:52,420
identify as.
It's almost like saying,

2567
02:05:52,750 --> 02:05:54,250
pointing out to them that they're 
different,

2568
02:05:54,670 --> 02:05:57,130
but they are different.
They are different.

2569
02:05:57,370 --> 02:06:02,370
But I can see how that can be upsetting 
for someone who identifies as the 

2570
02:06:02,370 --> 02:06:02,370
opposite sex.

2571
02:06:04,180 --> 02:06:05,080
Yeah.
You know what?

2572
02:06:05,081 --> 02:06:08,980
I can see how it's upsetting.
If you're short and you want to identify

2573
02:06:08,981 --> 02:06:10,600
as being tall.
You know what?

2574
02:06:10,601 --> 02:06:13,420
If I wanted to pretend that I was seven 
feet tall and you'd be like,

2575
02:06:13,421 --> 02:06:14,230
Joe,
your five eight,

2576
02:06:14,320 --> 02:06:16,030
like,
are you an asshole?

2577
02:06:16,420 --> 02:06:18,640
Why are you saying I'm a five eight?
But you are.

2578
02:06:18,760 --> 02:06:22,390
So if I say you're a trans woman,
which means you're a born a man,

2579
02:06:22,600 --> 02:06:25,330
you have a y chromosome,
like where's you're a piece of Shit,

2580
02:06:25,870 --> 02:06:28,510
how you point that out,
but that's what you are.

2581
02:06:28,870 --> 02:06:33,870
It's not that you're negative or you are
people who are dwarves are is that.

2582
02:06:34,540 --> 02:06:39,090
Is it evil to say that a dwarf is a 
dwarf or a little person and whatever,

2583
02:06:39,130 --> 02:06:44,130
whatever phrase you want to use,
are we supposed to acknowledge that 

2584
02:06:44,130 --> 02:06:46,010
there is an issue,
like if someone is born with a handicap,

2585
02:06:46,040 --> 02:06:46,870
are you supposed to.

2586
02:06:47,320 --> 02:06:52,320
Is that a fact?
Are you allowed to discuss it as a fact 

2587
02:06:52,320 --> 02:06:54,210
if you have autism,
my allowed to bring up the fact that you

2588
02:06:54,211 --> 02:06:56,770
are on the spectrum or am I supposed to 
ignore it?

2589
02:06:56,860 --> 02:06:58,540
Yeah.
Is it discrimination?

2590
02:06:58,541 --> 02:07:02,350
If you talk about reality,
if someone has a deformity,

2591
02:07:02,360 --> 02:07:07,360
are you allowed to discuss it or is it 
discrimination to discuss reality 

2592
02:07:07,360 --> 02:07:08,680
because what are we doing with our 
language?

2593
02:07:08,681 --> 02:07:12,700
What are we doing with the way we 
describe the actual things that are that

2594
02:07:12,701 --> 02:07:17,701
exist in the world and if we're not 
describing them in accurate terms 

2595
02:07:17,701 --> 02:07:21,640
because we're trying to somehow another 
stop people from getting hurt feelings,

2596
02:07:21,880 --> 02:07:26,880
what are these feelings based on these 
delusional perceptions of reality and 

2597
02:07:26,880 --> 02:07:29,140
why are we reinforcing these delusional 
perceptions of reality?

2598
02:07:29,320 --> 02:07:34,320
Because it seems to me that this kind of
language in this kind of exclusionary 

2599
02:07:34,320 --> 02:07:34,620
th,
th,

2600
02:07:34,670 --> 02:07:35,150
the,
the,

2601
02:07:35,151 --> 02:07:36,700
the inability

2602
02:07:36,700 --> 02:07:40,840
to use certain words and the inability 
to describe things accurately,

2603
02:07:40,870 --> 02:07:45,870
correctly,
and in many cases scientifically it 

2604
02:07:45,870 --> 02:07:45,870
hurts everybody.

2605
02:07:45,870 --> 02:07:46,250
Yeah,
I agree with that.

2606
02:07:46,251 --> 02:07:48,350
I don't think facts themselves are 
hateful.

2607
02:07:48,351 --> 02:07:52,460
I think people who use facts to justify 
discrimination,

2608
02:07:52,461 --> 02:07:57,461
that's where the problem is and that's 
where the efforts should be going 

2609
02:07:57,461 --> 02:07:58,130
because when you start to deny facts,
where does that leave you?

2610
02:07:58,160 --> 02:07:59,690
Where do you draw the line in that case?

2611
02:08:00,050 --> 02:08:01,650
Absolutely,
but I think it's,

2612
02:08:02,140 --> 02:08:04,130
there's something that's kind of cool 
about it,

2613
02:08:04,820 --> 02:08:09,820
that there are trans people and what's 
cool about it is that the world is 

2614
02:08:09,820 --> 02:08:11,600
weird.
You know,

2615
02:08:11,660 --> 02:08:16,660
and I'm,
I'm not happy that they get a lot of 

2616
02:08:16,660 --> 02:08:20,060
hate,
but I'm kinda happy that they exist.

2617
02:08:20,660 --> 02:08:25,660
I wish they could just be women.
I wish you could just hit a switch and 

2618
02:08:25,660 --> 02:08:25,660
you really wish you were born a woman.
Bam,

2619
02:08:25,660 --> 02:08:30,640
you're a woman.
But I suspect that even if you could do 

2620
02:08:30,640 --> 02:08:31,910
that,
some people would rather just be trans.

2621
02:08:32,300 --> 02:08:34,830
Some people would look like there's a 
lot of people that I know that are trans

2622
02:08:34,831 --> 02:08:36,680
and also have Dick's.
Yeah.

2623
02:08:36,930 --> 02:08:38,140
And they want to keep the deck.
Yeah.

2624
02:08:38,660 --> 02:08:39,410
And they're like,
okay,

2625
02:08:39,800 --> 02:08:41,570
like what's going on here?
And you,

2626
02:08:41,571 --> 02:08:46,571
you know,
that you're transphobic if you're a 

2627
02:08:46,571 --> 02:08:47,540
straight heterosexual male and you're 
not willing to date a trans woman with a

2628
02:08:47,541 --> 02:08:47,780
Dick,

2629
02:08:48,160 --> 02:08:53,160
but you know what it is,
it's actually a sexual preference for 

2630
02:08:53,160 --> 02:08:53,620
four men who will date trans women who 
were.

2631
02:08:53,760 --> 02:08:55,600
It's retaining their penis.
That's what it's called,

2632
02:08:55,601 --> 02:08:58,150
the literature.
They decide not to get surgery.

2633
02:08:58,151 --> 02:09:03,151
It's actually a particular sexual 
preference for the people that are 

2634
02:09:03,151 --> 02:09:05,260
attracted to that particular trans guy 
or morph affilia.

2635
02:09:05,540 --> 02:09:07,850
Whoa.
Someone told Jim Norton.

2636
02:09:11,400 --> 02:09:13,610
I'm nothing wrong with that either.
No,

2637
02:09:13,611 --> 02:09:16,540
nothing,
nothing what either do what you do,

2638
02:09:16,580 --> 02:09:21,580
but this is the thing,
the difference between a man and a 

2639
02:09:21,580 --> 02:09:21,850
woman,
a trans man,

2640
02:09:22,460 --> 02:09:26,060
a trans woman,
and then someone who could actually be a

2641
02:09:26,061 --> 02:09:31,061
woman who transitions.
I think we're going to get to a point 

2642
02:09:31,061 --> 02:09:34,301
within whether it's 100 years or 500 
years where we can use things like the 

2643
02:09:34,910 --> 02:09:39,910
future version of crispr or whatever 
comes down the line next.

2644
02:09:40,010 --> 02:09:44,230
Some scientific innovation that's going 
to allow people to literally transition.

2645
02:09:44,520 --> 02:09:49,520
Yeah,
I think it's gonna happen and when that 

2646
02:09:49,520 --> 02:09:49,520
happens,
I suspect they're going to say that word

2647
02:09:49,520 --> 02:09:50,440
again.
What was the one guy named Andrew?

2648
02:09:50,450 --> 02:09:52,370
More fulfilling?
It's going to be a bunch of those.

2649
02:09:52,990 --> 02:09:54,470
It's going to be a bunch of people like,
man,

2650
02:09:54,650 --> 02:09:56,180
I'd rather just stay at chick with a 
Dick.

2651
02:09:56,270 --> 02:09:56,990
I'll take it.
Yeah.

2652
02:09:56,991 --> 02:09:57,330
Well,
again,

2653
02:09:57,340 --> 02:10:02,340
Andrew more fulfilling is the preference
for male to female people who have 

2654
02:10:02,340 --> 02:10:03,650
retained their penis.
Fucking go for it.

2655
02:10:03,651 --> 02:10:05,000
Yeah.
Nothing wrong.

2656
02:10:05,060 --> 02:10:06,650
It's all good.
It's all good.

2657
02:10:06,651 --> 02:10:10,400
It's only when you tell other men that 
you have to conform to this.

2658
02:10:10,760 --> 02:10:15,760
I think that's where the problem is.
I think people should be allowed to be 

2659
02:10:15,760 --> 02:10:15,760
into what they're into.

2660
02:10:15,760 --> 02:10:16,920
Yes,
and the idea that you're transphobic,

2661
02:10:16,960 --> 02:10:20,410
and I've seen this,
I've seen articles written where they're

2662
02:10:20,411 --> 02:10:24,730
shitting on men that are not willing to 
date women with penises.

2663
02:10:25,270 --> 02:10:26,080
They call it the.

2664
02:10:26,440 --> 02:10:26,890
No,
sorry,

2665
02:10:26,891 --> 02:10:31,891
the cotton.
The cotton ceiling is the other way 

2666
02:10:31,891 --> 02:10:33,991
around.
When it's a male to female person and 

2667
02:10:33,991 --> 02:10:34,130
women don't want to date them.
Lesbians

2668
02:10:34,130 --> 02:10:35,840
don't want to date them because they 
have a penis.

2669
02:10:35,900 --> 02:10:38,780
What do they call it?
The cotton ceiling because it's like the

2670
02:10:38,781 --> 02:10:40,970
glass ceiling.
Acceptance has to do with underwear.

2671
02:10:43,310 --> 02:10:48,310
She's Christ.
So lesbians who don't want to date trans

2672
02:10:48,381 --> 02:10:50,500
women because penises.
Yeah.

2673
02:10:51,440 --> 02:10:53,600
What a wonderful world we live in.
I like it.

2674
02:10:54,020 --> 02:10:55,550
I liked it.
This world is weird.

2675
02:10:55,670 --> 02:10:57,290
I do.
So this is where

2676
02:10:57,510 --> 02:11:02,510
I think I get why people would see what 
I've said and think that it's 

2677
02:11:07,411 --> 02:11:10,380
transphobic.
I get like who I am.

2678
02:11:10,440 --> 02:11:12,210
I get that,
that it's a problem.

2679
02:11:12,630 --> 02:11:15,600
I get just looking at me as a problem.
I mean I'm,

2680
02:11:15,660 --> 02:11:17,790
I'm,
I'm a cage fighting commentator,

2681
02:11:18,090 --> 02:11:20,280
you know,
I'm a dirty standup comedian.

2682
02:11:20,680 --> 02:11:21,290
This,
I mean,

2683
02:11:21,320 --> 02:11:24,660
I've seen like I would be your enemy,

2684
02:11:25,010 --> 02:11:26,630
but people shouldn't assume,
right?

2685
02:11:26,720 --> 02:11:29,480
Like you're your own person so you might
look a certain way.

2686
02:11:30,460 --> 02:11:33,610
It's just what people do.
It's the same way a guy looks at a chick

2687
02:11:33,611 --> 02:11:35,260
with a Dick and goes,
yikes,

2688
02:11:35,470 --> 02:11:37,920
what do we got going on here?
Let me just.

2689
02:11:39,460 --> 02:11:42,760
I just think as me,
as an individual,

2690
02:11:42,761 --> 02:11:47,761
as a human being,
one thing I like about it is I like 

2691
02:11:47,761 --> 02:11:52,470
things that are weird.
I like things that defy the standard 

2692
02:11:52,470 --> 02:11:52,470
definition.

2693
02:11:52,470 --> 02:11:55,180
I'm the same.
Think it's more interesting.

2694
02:11:55,780 --> 02:11:57,430
It's far more interesting.
Yeah.

2695
02:11:57,550 --> 02:12:00,030
It's interesting when you talked to 
neuroscientists,

2696
02:12:00,060 --> 02:12:02,260
whereas a playboy tee shirt,
right?

2697
02:12:02,290 --> 02:12:03,440
You're a Weirdo.
Yeah.

2698
02:12:03,460 --> 02:12:04,240
Do you like it?
Yeah,

2699
02:12:04,241 --> 02:12:04,990
it's cool.
It's a cool,

2700
02:12:04,991 --> 02:12:06,250
clever.
You are a Weirdo.

2701
02:12:06,310 --> 02:12:11,310
I am aware though for sure.
And that relates to your sense of humor 

2702
02:12:11,310 --> 02:12:14,251
too though,
because my sense of humor is really dry 

2703
02:12:14,251 --> 02:12:17,190
and I feel that's part of the way I look
at the world and why I appreciate the 

2704
02:12:17,190 --> 02:12:18,190
world the way.
Oh yeah.

2705
02:12:18,240 --> 02:12:19,060
Oh,
for sure.

2706
02:12:19,061 --> 02:12:20,330
I embrace the weird.

2707
02:12:20,370 --> 02:12:21,640
Yes,
I really do.

2708
02:12:21,820 --> 02:12:24,160
I'd love it.
I'd love that.

2709
02:12:24,190 --> 02:12:26,080
Things are strange.
I do.

2710
02:12:26,350 --> 02:12:28,990
I think it's interesting.
I really do.

2711
02:12:29,010 --> 02:12:32,770
I think so.
I think everything's interesting.

2712
02:12:33,070 --> 02:12:33,690
I mean,
I,

2713
02:12:33,750 --> 02:12:36,430
I,
and I try to cultivate that.

2714
02:12:36,580 --> 02:12:41,580
I really do.
I go out of my way to try to look at 

2715
02:12:41,580 --> 02:12:44,641
things with fresh eyes and especially 
because I smoke a lot of pot and so 

2716
02:12:44,641 --> 02:12:46,500
whenever I do that I kind of always have
a new way of looking at it.

2717
02:12:46,510 --> 02:12:47,080
Like,
oh,

2718
02:12:47,090 --> 02:12:52,090
I never even thought about it that way,
but that's one of the things that are 

2719
02:12:52,090 --> 02:12:52,090
really like about marijuana.
And I tried.

2720
02:12:52,090 --> 02:12:54,790
I've tried to explain that to people 
that don't smoke pot.

2721
02:12:55,060 --> 02:12:58,810
I got a conversation with Ted nugent 
about that and one of the things,

2722
02:12:58,870 --> 02:13:03,870
because he had this perception that 
people smoke pot or lazy and Ne'er do 

2723
02:13:03,870 --> 02:13:04,810
wells.
I'm like,

2724
02:13:04,811 --> 02:13:06,610
dude,
I can't have enough jobs.

2725
02:13:06,611 --> 02:13:11,611
I have so many.
I do do so many fucking super high 

2726
02:13:11,611 --> 02:13:11,611
functioning.
I'm always doing something.

2727
02:13:11,611 --> 02:13:16,531
I'm not lazy,
but I get the benefit that I get out of 

2728
02:13:16,961 --> 02:13:19,150
it as a benefit.
That is not often.

2729
02:13:21,490 --> 02:13:22,470
It's not,
uh,

2730
02:13:23,440 --> 02:13:28,440
it's not often promoted.
And that benefit is there's something 

2731
02:13:28,631 --> 02:13:32,640
good about being nervous,
there's something good about what people

2732
02:13:32,641 --> 02:13:37,641
call paranoia is something good about 
heightened perspective that is brought 

2733
02:13:38,101 --> 02:13:43,101
upon by psychedelics or buy marijuana 
where you are forced to reexamine what 

2734
02:13:44,551 --> 02:13:47,820
you've taken for granted.
And that's what I like about it.

2735
02:13:48,060 --> 02:13:51,780
And so what I like about one of the 
things that I like about smoking pot,

2736
02:13:52,050 --> 02:13:55,050
besides the fact that I believe it makes
me more compassionate,

2737
02:13:55,051 --> 02:13:58,290
it makes it instills a better sense of 
community.

2738
02:13:58,291 --> 02:14:01,500
It makes me more friendly and more 
loving and it definitely does that,

2739
02:14:01,890 --> 02:14:06,570
but it also makes me look at things with
fresh eyes and appreciate the weirdness,

2740
02:14:07,640 --> 02:14:11,670
the weird.
Like I genuinely love it when I see like

2741
02:14:11,760 --> 02:14:13,370
some girl.
Do you know Bailey?

2742
02:14:13,380 --> 02:14:18,380
Jay is a trans woman with a giant Dick.
She got pictures of her Dick.

2743
02:14:20,840 --> 02:14:23,790
Is Jamie going to pull it up right now 
and think you can.

2744
02:14:23,791 --> 02:14:26,010
We'll get kicked off of youtube.
But I love it.

2745
02:14:26,130 --> 02:14:28,890
I like the fact that it's real.
It doesn't bother me.

2746
02:14:29,140 --> 02:14:30,930
Happy.
I think it's fun.

2747
02:14:30,970 --> 02:14:33,000
Are you going to enjoy a more fulfilled?
No,

2748
02:14:33,210 --> 02:14:34,270
no I'm not.
But I,

2749
02:14:34,350 --> 02:14:38,820
I like the fact that they exist,
I do acceptance and I like the fact that

2750
02:14:38,821 --> 02:14:43,290
people liked them and I liked the fact 
that it makes certain people happy if it

2751
02:14:43,291 --> 02:14:46,080
makes them happy or people that are 
attracted to them happy.

2752
02:14:46,620 --> 02:14:48,360
I really do like it.
I don't,

2753
02:14:48,790 --> 02:14:52,020
uh,
don't like definitions I don't like.

2754
02:14:52,380 --> 02:14:55,830
I don't like restrictions,
you know,

2755
02:14:55,980 --> 02:15:00,980
so where people would get an incorrect 
assumption is my radical stance against 

2756
02:15:02,100 --> 02:15:07,100
this trans woman fighting other women 
because I recognize that as being unfair

2757
02:15:09,390 --> 02:15:12,960
and not well because there's suppression
of the debate as well.

2758
02:15:13,140 --> 02:15:18,140
Yeah.
It's one thing if you could talk about 

2759
02:15:18,140 --> 02:15:18,140
it openly.
Well,

2760
02:15:18,140 --> 02:15:18,140
it's also something that I'm an expert 
in,

2761
02:15:18,140 --> 02:15:20,070
so I'm like,
stop,

2762
02:15:20,100 --> 02:15:20,940
don't,
don't,

2763
02:15:21,030 --> 02:15:26,030
don't try to compare this to fucking 
tennis because even in tennis it wasn't 

2764
02:15:26,030 --> 02:15:27,600
fair,
but this is a different thing.

2765
02:15:28,080 --> 02:15:30,750
It just,
it's a radically different thing.

2766
02:15:31,140 --> 02:15:33,090
It's interesting because I heard you 
talk about this,

2767
02:15:33,091 --> 02:15:35,430
I don't know if it was your interview 
with Josh Barnett,

2768
02:15:35,431 --> 02:15:40,431
but when you first get into the cage,
you don't know what the other person is 

2769
02:15:40,431 --> 02:15:40,431
going to be like until you start 
fighting.

2770
02:15:40,630 --> 02:15:41,830
Just imagine,
you know,

2771
02:15:41,910 --> 02:15:44,460
if you go in and you don't know that 
someone was born male,

2772
02:15:44,461 --> 02:15:49,461
how that's very big disadvantage.
I think there's a propensity for 

2773
02:15:49,461 --> 02:15:54,231
violence that exists in the mind of a 
man that I just don't know if it's the 

2774
02:15:55,171 --> 02:15:58,500
same in most women.
I just think,

2775
02:15:59,430 --> 02:16:00,990
I don't know how much of that.

2776
02:16:01,180 --> 02:16:03,360
Like I don't know if you turn me into a 
woman,

2777
02:16:03,600 --> 02:16:07,140
how much of that you would squeeze out?
I don't know,

2778
02:16:08,400 --> 02:16:12,180
but I know there's a switch that men 
have because I've seen it go off.

2779
02:16:12,181 --> 02:16:13,230
I've seen,
I've seen,

2780
02:16:14,910 --> 02:16:19,910
I've probably seen more people get 
fucked up in real life than 99 point 

2781
02:16:22,861 --> 02:16:25,920
nine percent of people that have ever 
lived other than like,

2782
02:16:26,950 --> 02:16:31,950
you know,
people lived in Roman times and we get 

2783
02:16:31,950 --> 02:16:32,410
chopped up by swords,
but people in modern time,

2784
02:16:32,411 --> 02:16:37,210
I can targe fisticuffs people getting 
head kicked and beaten down with elbows.

2785
02:16:37,420 --> 02:16:42,420
I've probably seen more of that than 
almost anyone that's ever lived is sort 

2786
02:16:42,420 --> 02:16:45,940
of probably a small group of people.
I got thousand people on the planet that

2787
02:16:45,990 --> 02:16:48,430
seen as many people get fucked up 
personally is I have,

2788
02:16:49,070 --> 02:16:52,710
so I did you.
Did you date at chunk you?

2789
02:16:52,711 --> 02:16:55,030
You get a sense of what you're seeing.

2790
02:16:55,030 --> 02:16:57,370
You get a sense of and you,
you understand there's a,

2791
02:16:57,940 --> 02:16:59,020
there's a,
there's,

2792
02:17:00,490 --> 02:17:04,030
there's a technical violence that women 
are capable of.

2793
02:17:04,031 --> 02:17:09,031
For sure.
I mean especially like extreme examples 

2794
02:17:09,031 --> 02:17:11,881
like cris cyborg is like super violent 
or when Holly Holm head kicked Ronda 

2795
02:17:11,881 --> 02:17:13,600
Rousey and then hammer fists at her 
while she was unconscious.

2796
02:17:13,870 --> 02:17:17,080
Super violent,
but also very technical violence.

2797
02:17:17,380 --> 02:17:22,380
And then there's an extreme over the top
masculine violence that I've seen that's

2798
02:17:25,030 --> 02:17:27,470
even more ferocious.
There's,

2799
02:17:27,500 --> 02:17:31,440
there's something to it that is another 
level this in.

2800
02:17:32,050 --> 02:17:35,020
And this is not saying that men are 
better than women.

2801
02:17:35,021 --> 02:17:40,021
This is not.
This is just I'm saying there's a thing 

2802
02:17:40,021 --> 02:17:42,360
that men do.
There's a reason why men cause all wars.

2803
02:17:43,240 --> 02:17:46,540
Men Cause all wars.
Women are fucking suit up and going into

2804
02:17:46,541 --> 02:17:47,680
battle and,
and,

2805
02:17:47,730 --> 02:17:50,120
and trying to conquer as a giant,
you know,

2806
02:17:50,121 --> 02:17:54,940
million strong group of women,
soldiers invading a foreign army.

2807
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:56,320
No,
this is not happening.

2808
02:17:56,350 --> 02:17:58,630
This is a male behavior.
Testosterone.

2809
02:17:58,810 --> 02:17:59,740
It is.
And it,

2810
02:17:59,770 --> 02:18:02,590
it's also.
There's something about males.

2811
02:18:02,660 --> 02:18:04,030
This,
this switch,

2812
02:18:04,120 --> 02:18:08,110
this violent switch that exists.
It exists in a very dark way.

2813
02:18:08,320 --> 02:18:13,320
Women are capable of shooting people,
stabbing people and doing all these 

2814
02:18:13,320 --> 02:18:13,320
things.
Don't get me wrong,

2815
02:18:13,320 --> 02:18:17,551
I'm not saying that,
but it does not happen in the same 

2816
02:18:17,551 --> 02:18:17,551
numbers that it happens with men.
It just doesn't.

2817
02:18:18,040 --> 02:18:23,040
And I think that this is something that 
also has to be taken into consideration 

2818
02:18:23,040 --> 02:18:23,620
when you talk to you about men versus 
women.

2819
02:18:23,980 --> 02:18:28,980
Like it's a,
it's a different thing and people don't 

2820
02:18:28,980 --> 02:18:32,551
think it's a different thing have 
probably never been punched in the face 

2821
02:18:32,551 --> 02:18:34,180
by a guy you know,
or seeing guys punch guys in the face or

2822
02:18:34,181 --> 02:18:38,140
been around it enough where you realize 
like it's a different thing.

2823
02:18:38,560 --> 02:18:40,510
You know,
I've seen some awesome women fights,

2824
02:18:40,630 --> 02:18:44,500
awesome women fights amazing,
super technical,

2825
02:18:44,501 --> 02:18:47,360
even very violent,
but God damn it,

2826
02:18:47,410 --> 02:18:49,210
there's a different.
There's a difference.

2827
02:18:49,420 --> 02:18:51,360
It's just not the same thing.
Yeah,

2828
02:18:51,610 --> 02:18:56,610
no,
I would definitely agree with that and 

2829
02:18:56,610 --> 02:18:57,070
most people would.
But if in today's climate,

2830
02:18:57,550 --> 02:19:02,550
in certain circles that would be 
considered transphobic or maybe even 

2831
02:19:02,550 --> 02:19:02,550
sexist,

2832
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:04,770
well,
there's also this narrative that women,

2833
02:19:04,771 --> 02:19:08,430
because they need to be like men and 
some level women have to be as strong as

2834
02:19:08,431 --> 02:19:12,750
men and I've seen this where they will 
put like published piece of saying women

2835
02:19:12,751 --> 02:19:17,130
are as strong as men physically strong 
and that's not even true.

2836
02:19:17,160 --> 02:19:18,000
It's not true.

2837
02:19:18,530 --> 02:19:23,530
Only there's a not true.
It's you can demonstrate it like 

2838
02:19:23,530 --> 02:19:28,071
scientifically it's not true.
You look at the data in terms of what 

2839
02:19:28,071 --> 02:19:28,071
men have,
what,

2840
02:19:28,071 --> 02:19:30,650
what they can do.
Like this is this guy,

2841
02:19:30,880 --> 02:19:35,880
this woman who used to be a man who is 
now competing in weightlifting and 

2842
02:19:35,880 --> 02:19:39,791
Australia,
like everybody's going crazy over this 

2843
02:19:39,791 --> 02:19:42,311
one who is fucking crazy.
It doesn't make any sense that they're 

2844
02:19:42,311 --> 02:19:43,250
allowing this.
If this is so nonsensical,

2845
02:19:43,430 --> 02:19:47,300
if you want to have trans transgender 
Olympics,

2846
02:19:47,570 --> 02:19:48,980
go for it.
Do that,

2847
02:19:49,340 --> 02:19:54,340
but to try to pretend until we come up 
with some sort of a way like with crispr

2848
02:19:54,721 --> 02:19:57,890
or whatever we talked about before,
where you can actually turn a man into a

2849
02:19:57,891 --> 02:20:02,891
woman,
turn a woman into a man until it's real 

2850
02:20:02,891 --> 02:20:02,891
clean.
We look at it and go,

2851
02:20:02,891 --> 02:20:04,550
Yup,
we just did the chromosome test.

2852
02:20:04,551 --> 02:20:09,551
You've got a y chromosome now and you've
erased 30 years of testosterone and you 

2853
02:20:10,611 --> 02:20:12,260
know a man now is built like you.

2854
02:20:12,740 --> 02:20:14,630
Right?
Then we're good.

2855
02:20:14,860 --> 02:20:16,460
We're good now.
It's an actual woman.

2856
02:20:16,520 --> 02:20:17,960
Yeah.
Until then,

2857
02:20:19,220 --> 02:20:24,220
man,
you're dealing with some hardcore 

2858
02:20:24,220 --> 02:20:26,350
variables and to not to be in denial of 
those variables is silly and I'm gonna 

2859
02:20:28,280 --> 02:20:30,470
I'm going to stand against it every time
because I think it's.

2860
02:20:30,620 --> 02:20:32,330
I see what it is.
I mean,

2861
02:20:32,331 --> 02:20:34,550
this is like a religious ideology,
you're,

2862
02:20:34,560 --> 02:20:36,920
you're,
you're purposely ignoring facts.

2863
02:20:37,280 --> 02:20:38,870
Do you feel like most people in the 
industry.

2864
02:20:38,871 --> 02:20:40,760
I agree with you or how did they feel 
it?

2865
02:20:40,810 --> 02:20:42,830
Yeah.
Oh fuck.

2866
02:20:42,831 --> 02:20:44,570
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

2867
02:20:44,571 --> 02:20:49,571
The people who don't is a minor group 
and they're all like super progressive,

2868
02:20:50,181 --> 02:20:55,181
left wing,
left leaning and some of them were 

2869
02:20:55,181 --> 02:20:56,930
scared to talk about it because other 
people aren't as vocal.

2870
02:20:57,260 --> 02:21:02,260
Well,
they just didn't want to get the 

2871
02:21:02,260 --> 02:21:02,260
blowback.
It's all it is.

2872
02:21:02,450 --> 02:21:07,450
But in terms of like fighters,
it was like a hundred percent mean 

2873
02:21:08,331 --> 02:21:08,720
Ashley.

2874
02:21:08,720 --> 02:21:13,010
Evan Smith is a fucking beast for taking
that fight and even tougher for winning.

2875
02:21:13,400 --> 02:21:15,110
But then again,
she went into the UFC.

2876
02:21:15,111 --> 02:21:17,660
She,
she's in a UFC level fighter,

2877
02:21:18,140 --> 02:21:20,150
which is,
there's a big difference,

2878
02:21:20,570 --> 02:21:23,300
you know,
and what she was kicking me.

2879
02:21:23,340 --> 02:21:26,660
If you look at like the caliber of 
competition that she's fought,

2880
02:21:26,930 --> 02:21:29,780
guys like Raquel Pennington or girls,
excuse me,

2881
02:21:29,781 --> 02:21:31,580
like Raquel Pennington,
sorry,

2882
02:21:31,581 --> 02:21:36,581
Raquel.
And look at who found foxes fighting 

2883
02:21:36,581 --> 02:21:36,950
when she was fighting,
you know,

2884
02:21:36,951 --> 02:21:41,951
lower level competitions.
That's a giant leap between Raquel 

2885
02:21:41,951 --> 02:21:46,390
Pennington and someone who is on these 
amateur circuits and Raquel Pennington 

2886
02:21:46,390 --> 02:21:49,310
beat Ashley Evan Smith.
Crazy fight was submitted with a bulldog

2887
02:21:49,311 --> 02:21:51,650
choke with like one second ago.
We're screaming.

2888
02:21:51,651 --> 02:21:53,280
It was nuts.
Covered in blood.

2889
02:21:53,281 --> 02:21:54,650
It's fucking chaos.
Right?

2890
02:21:55,040 --> 02:21:59,600
But this is like super elite world 
championship level fighting.

2891
02:22:00,210 --> 02:22:01,410
That's the difference,
right?

2892
02:22:01,411 --> 02:22:02,990
Yeah.
It's just fucking different,

2893
02:22:03,770 --> 02:22:04,770
you know?
Yeah.

2894
02:22:05,080 --> 02:22:07,370
So there was a lot of people that 
supported me,

2895
02:22:07,940 --> 02:22:09,970
but I knew I was right.
You know,

2896
02:22:10,230 --> 02:22:10,670
I was like,
no,

2897
02:22:10,700 --> 02:22:12,740
that other people are secretly agreeing 
with you.

2898
02:22:12,810 --> 02:22:17,810
I will not even secretly,
they just didn't want to talk about it 

2899
02:22:17,810 --> 02:22:17,810
publicly.
It wasn't that.

2900
02:22:17,810 --> 02:22:18,890
It was a secret,
you know,

2901
02:22:18,891 --> 02:22:22,220
there was no people that were coming up 
to me disagreeing with me.

2902
02:22:22,250 --> 02:22:26,130
Trans people were agreeing with me,
trans people that I'm friends with,

2903
02:22:26,150 --> 02:22:27,330
like,
that shit is crazy.

2904
02:22:27,331 --> 02:22:32,331
That bitch is out of her fucking mind.
It was funny and also in the long run 

2905
02:22:35,400 --> 02:22:37,700
over many,
many conversations about it,

2906
02:22:37,701 --> 02:22:38,790
people realize,
okay,

2907
02:22:38,791 --> 02:22:42,110
I see your perspective.
Like you're not discriminatory.

2908
02:22:42,140 --> 02:22:47,140
No,
it's just about combat sports and even 

2909
02:22:47,140 --> 02:22:47,140
about weightlifting,
it's like,

2910
02:22:47,140 --> 02:22:51,411
come on man,
imagine if you a woman and all your 

2911
02:22:51,411 --> 02:22:53,661
life,
you've been fucking power cleaning 

2912
02:22:53,661 --> 02:22:57,530
through the force of will and 
determination and your focus and 

2913
02:22:57,530 --> 02:23:01,220
discipline,
and then some trans woman comes in and 

2914
02:23:01,220 --> 02:23:05,421
just his bitches lifting 100 pounds more
than you're ever going to live and 

2915
02:23:05,421 --> 02:23:05,421
you're like,
well,

2916
02:23:05,421 --> 02:23:09,120
what the fuck?
This isn't fair that those poor girls in

2917
02:23:09,121 --> 02:23:14,121
Texas that had a wrestle that girl 
because they're discriminatory in the 

2918
02:23:14,121 --> 02:23:16,110
opposite way and they won't recognize 
that this trans girls,

2919
02:23:16,111 --> 02:23:19,740
a boy or this trans boy is a boy get 
injured too.

2920
02:23:19,980 --> 02:23:21,180
Fuck yeah,
yeah,

2921
02:23:21,230 --> 02:23:24,600
mean literally you're allowing someone.
You're allowing girls to take steroids.

2922
02:23:24,660 --> 02:23:27,120
That's what you're doing.
You're saying one girl can take steroids

2923
02:23:27,270 --> 02:23:29,730
because she thinks she's a boy.
We don't think she's a boy,

2924
02:23:29,731 --> 02:23:31,710
so we'll let her take steroids.
It's like,

2925
02:23:32,520 --> 02:23:34,430
why are you letting her take steroids?
This?

2926
02:23:34,610 --> 02:23:39,610
Why are you late or take testosterone?
Do you know how old that girl was or 

2927
02:23:39,610 --> 02:23:39,610
that we've seven chance,
boy,

2928
02:23:39,610 --> 02:23:41,760
okay,
one states two years in a row.

2929
02:23:42,300 --> 02:23:43,170
Wow.
Shocker.

2930
02:23:45,830 --> 02:23:47,000
But you know,
by taking those,

2931
02:23:47,090 --> 02:23:50,750
by taking testosterone too,
he is sterilizing himself.

2932
02:23:50,900 --> 02:23:52,940
Yeah.
Which is crazy at that age.

2933
02:23:53,690 --> 02:23:58,690
Yeah.
I want to say specifically of that 

2934
02:23:58,690 --> 02:23:58,690
person,
but just in general.

2935
02:23:58,690 --> 02:24:03,550
Well,
as a neuroscientist in your 

2936
02:24:03,550 --> 02:24:03,550
understanding of the frontal lobe and 
the development of human,

2937
02:24:03,850 --> 02:24:07,750
because you realize like your decision 
making capabilities not fully formed,

2938
02:24:07,880 --> 02:24:11,360
not till you're almost 30.
So I just want people should vote.

2939
02:24:11,540 --> 02:24:13,400
That's when they,
that's when they should make any sort of

2940
02:24:13,401 --> 02:24:18,401
important decision.
But it's crazy because you think a 17 

2941
02:24:18,401 --> 02:24:21,101
year old or even like A.
I don't even 21 year old can decide if 

2942
02:24:21,101 --> 02:24:21,860
they want to be sterile for life.

2943
02:24:22,040 --> 02:24:22,990
No,
no.

2944
02:24:22,991 --> 02:24:25,150
If you gave me a chance at 17 to get a 
vasectomy,

2945
02:24:25,151 --> 02:24:26,890
I might've done it.
You know,

2946
02:24:27,130 --> 02:24:30,250
now I'm happy I have kids,
but it's um,

2947
02:24:31,300 --> 02:24:34,960
it's an irreversible decision,
which is why it gets weird.

2948
02:24:35,200 --> 02:24:40,200
Right.
It's like if you decide to sterilize 

2949
02:24:40,200 --> 02:24:40,200
yourself at testosterone,
is there any.

2950
02:24:40,200 --> 02:24:41,890
Coming back from that,
have you started taking estrogen again?

2951
02:24:41,891 --> 02:24:43,840
Where your,
where your cycle kicked back in?

2952
02:24:44,880 --> 02:24:45,240
No.
Well,

2953
02:24:45,241 --> 02:24:46,800
once you start taking cross sex 
hormones.

2954
02:24:46,801 --> 02:24:47,760
No,
no,

2955
02:24:47,800 --> 02:24:52,800
no,
and it's amazing because parents are 

2956
02:24:52,800 --> 02:24:52,800
saying,
well,

2957
02:24:52,800 --> 02:24:56,571
you know,
if that's the decision they want to 

2958
02:24:56,571 --> 02:24:58,161
make,
then they should make that decision and 

2959
02:24:58,161 --> 02:24:58,161
they're okay with it.

2960
02:24:58,161 --> 02:25:01,120
What's interesting too is the language 
that we use and that people use in the 

2961
02:25:01,120 --> 02:25:05,351
media now.
If there was a story about a woman who 

2962
02:25:05,351 --> 02:25:05,351
just gave birth.
Oh,

2963
02:25:05,530 --> 02:25:10,530
tell me more actually,
because I thought I thought I was 

2964
02:25:10,530 --> 02:25:10,530
thinking of something,
but I think it's something else.

2965
02:25:10,530 --> 02:25:11,150
She used to be a woman.
She'd be,

2966
02:25:11,170 --> 02:25:15,080
she was transitioning to being a man and
she got pregnant.

2967
02:25:15,220 --> 02:25:18,860
Okay.
But became a full man.

2968
02:25:19,060 --> 02:25:20,830
Oh,
after she gave birth,

2969
02:25:20,900 --> 02:25:24,220
had her breast removed the deal.
Right.

2970
02:25:24,790 --> 02:25:28,360
Celebrated,
celebrated as this men give birth.

2971
02:25:28,361 --> 02:25:29,190
But it was,
well,

2972
02:25:29,260 --> 02:25:29,830
not only that,
she,

2973
02:25:29,860 --> 02:25:32,350
I don't think she breastfed was,
shouldn't be celebrated.

2974
02:25:32,740 --> 02:25:36,250
Like,
like there's massive amounts of evidence

2975
02:25:36,340 --> 02:25:41,340
that breastfeeding is super positive 
because that look at that full beard 

2976
02:25:42,640 --> 02:25:47,640
holding a baby.
So clearly taking the testosterone 

2977
02:25:47,640 --> 02:25:48,910
again,
if not taking it while the baby's in the

2978
02:25:48,911 --> 02:25:50,720
womb.
And uh,

2979
02:25:51,070 --> 02:25:55,690
I'm sure five years after having a child
as a woman,

2980
02:25:55,720 --> 02:26:00,720
what transgender man gives birth to baby
five years after having a child as a 

2981
02:26:01,541 --> 02:26:02,920
woman.
Okay.

2982
02:26:03,370 --> 02:26:08,370
So she had a child as a woman and then 
she got pregnant again as a man.

2983
02:26:09,010 --> 02:26:11,920
That's what they're saying.
Okay.

2984
02:26:12,040 --> 02:26:13,720
What does that mean?
What's going on there?

2985
02:26:14,370 --> 02:26:15,460
Magic.
You are an alien.

2986
02:26:17,480 --> 02:26:19,520
So I guess it isn't impossible to get 
pregnant.

2987
02:26:19,521 --> 02:26:22,280
But if you're straight from pubertal 
blockers,

2988
02:26:22,281 --> 02:26:23,730
straight onto cross sex hormones,
you know,

2989
02:26:23,740 --> 02:26:28,100
your body hasn't even really developed.
So in that case,

2990
02:26:28,160 --> 02:26:29,360
so as a grown up,

2991
02:26:31,080 --> 02:26:33,330
it's less likely that you will become 
sterile.

2992
02:26:33,331 --> 02:26:33,900
Is that the case?

2993
02:26:34,080 --> 02:26:36,210
I think it depends on how.
I'm not an endocrinologist,

2994
02:26:36,211 --> 02:26:41,211
but I think it has to do with how long 
you've been on the hormones and probably

2995
02:26:41,431 --> 02:26:42,930
how old you were when you started.

2996
02:26:44,410 --> 02:26:44,860
Right?

2997
02:26:45,080 --> 02:26:46,400
But in this case,
I mean I've,

2998
02:26:46,520 --> 02:26:51,520
I've seen cases too where trans women 
will breastfeed but there and the 

2999
02:26:52,971 --> 02:26:56,820
doctors say this is an amazing thing,
but they're taking hormone.

3000
02:26:56,821 --> 02:26:59,300
So basically those hormones are going to
the baby when they're

3001
02:26:59,420 --> 02:27:02,960
breastfeeding the boy.

3002
02:27:03,350 --> 02:27:08,350
I feel,
I mean I even feel bad saying child in 

3003
02:27:08,350 --> 02:27:08,350
danger mode.
I know I feel bad saying this right now,

3004
02:27:08,350 --> 02:27:12,590
but why I feel it feels like I'm placing
judgment I guess

3005
02:27:12,870 --> 02:27:17,870
shouldn't be placing judgment.
While we were talking about something 

3006
02:27:17,870 --> 02:27:19,540
that's publicly projected,
something that's in the news,

3007
02:27:19,550 --> 02:27:24,550
they chose to make this.
They chose to be there with their 

3008
02:27:24,550 --> 02:27:25,660
cameras were taking pictures of them.
They're proclaiming this,

3009
02:27:25,880 --> 02:27:27,680
that the other side isn't being 
presented to.

3010
02:27:27,681 --> 02:27:32,681
I think that's part of the problem is 
the other side of the things that we're 

3011
02:27:32,681 --> 02:27:32,681
saying.

3012
02:27:32,681 --> 02:27:32,681
Yes.
Well this is what.

3013
02:27:32,830 --> 02:27:35,620
So what are the other thoughts?
What is the other side?

3014
02:27:35,820 --> 02:27:40,820
Well,
the one side of being that is 

3015
02:27:40,820 --> 02:27:40,820
progressive and if you identify as a 
woman and you have a child,

3016
02:27:40,820 --> 02:27:45,590
then you should raise that child as if 
that's no different from any other 

3017
02:27:45,590 --> 02:27:46,530
woman,
but she doesn't identify as a woman.

3018
02:27:46,560 --> 02:27:48,360
She identifies as a man or not this 
person,

3019
02:27:48,361 --> 02:27:49,980
the person I was talking about who is 
breastfeeding

3020
02:27:50,530 --> 02:27:54,740
male-to-female,
you can breastfeed male to female.

3021
02:27:55,550 --> 02:27:58,250
Oh,
oh,

3022
02:27:58,940 --> 02:28:01,100
wait a minute for that.
It's not his kid,

3023
02:28:01,460 --> 02:28:03,200
her kid.
Oh boy,

3024
02:28:03,210 --> 02:28:05,390
we worth this is why those gender 
pronouns,

3025
02:28:05,420 --> 02:28:10,420
Jordan Peterson was wrong.
This is why we need all these separate 

3026
02:28:10,420 --> 02:28:11,720
gender pronouns.
All 72 of them.

3027
02:28:12,020 --> 02:28:13,010
Well,
here's the other thing,

3028
02:28:13,400 --> 02:28:18,400
this male transgender male obviously 
still likes dudes.

3029
02:28:21,460 --> 02:28:24,080
The one we just saw because she got 
pregnant by a guy.

3030
02:28:26,450 --> 02:28:28,270
Yep.
So stay at check,

3031
02:28:28,271 --> 02:28:33,271
Bro.
I don't know as just telling you to do 

3032
02:28:33,861 --> 02:28:36,290
whatever you want to do,
but you know,

3033
02:28:36,291 --> 02:28:41,291
we should probably take into 
consideration the idea that maybe this 

3034
02:28:41,291 --> 02:28:43,160
isn't the best thing for that child to 
be subjected to hormones.

3035
02:28:43,380 --> 02:28:43,990
No,
that's,

3036
02:28:44,040 --> 02:28:46,800
that's the bottom line.
I think whether a parent is trans or not

3037
02:28:47,550 --> 02:28:49,260
have a bearing on their ability to 
parent.

3038
02:28:49,310 --> 02:28:54,310
So while that trans man was pregnant,
did he continue his testosterone 

3039
02:28:54,310 --> 02:28:54,980
therapy?
Is the question,

3040
02:28:55,580 --> 02:28:56,750
right?
That's the question.

3041
02:28:57,870 --> 02:29:00,230
Hold this one says no.
That's how will they get pregnant?

3042
02:29:00,470 --> 02:29:05,470
Oh,
so they backed off to have a baby on 

3043
02:29:05,470 --> 02:29:05,470
purpose.
They were,

3044
02:29:05,470 --> 02:29:05,470
they took,
they got off the testosterone for health

3045
02:29:05,470 --> 02:29:09,410
reasons and then got pregnant.
That's this particular case.

3046
02:29:09,411 --> 02:29:10,800
Health reasons.
Yeah.

3047
02:29:11,120 --> 02:29:12,710
But I thought it was natural and 
awesome.

3048
02:29:13,370 --> 02:29:15,020
It's good for you.
That's the other thing too,

3049
02:29:15,021 --> 02:29:16,850
right?
If it is natural,

3050
02:29:17,840 --> 02:29:22,840
why do you have to have synthetic 
hormones injected into your body that 

3051
02:29:22,840 --> 02:29:26,321
are not endogenous like they did not 
even supposed to be in your body?

3052
02:29:27,020 --> 02:29:30,320
This is so crazy.
We live in such a bizarro world.

3053
02:29:30,530 --> 02:29:35,530
Seeing a guy with a beard who was fully 
pregnant with a hairy chest is so 

3054
02:29:35,530 --> 02:29:36,920
fucking odd.
I'd assume me as a hairy chest.

3055
02:29:37,640 --> 02:29:38,330
It's also,
I mean,

3056
02:29:38,331 --> 02:29:41,000
it goes against people who say that 
gender is a social construct.

3057
02:29:41,240 --> 02:29:44,270
Why do you need to take testosterone 
then to meet the opposite sex?

3058
02:29:44,990 --> 02:29:49,990
Well,
this is one of the weirdest things that 

3059
02:29:49,990 --> 02:29:49,990
the argument that I had,
um,

3060
02:29:49,990 --> 02:29:52,870
about one person online where they said 
about Fallon Fox,

3061
02:29:53,780 --> 02:29:58,780
they said she's always been a woman.
And I said even when she was having sex 

3062
02:29:58,780 --> 02:30:01,460
with a woman and got her pregnant and 
she said yes.

3063
02:30:01,490 --> 02:30:03,320
Even then I'm like,
we're done.

3064
02:30:03,500 --> 02:30:05,900
We're done here.
We were in make believe land now.

3065
02:30:06,730 --> 02:30:08,150
But what does that mean?
Your role?

3066
02:30:08,240 --> 02:30:10,670
You were a woman when you were having 
sex with a woman.

3067
02:30:10,910 --> 02:30:13,460
So why not just stay that woman who has 
sex with women?

3068
02:30:13,760 --> 02:30:15,770
I think it's because people want to have
sympathy.

3069
02:30:15,771 --> 02:30:17,180
Right?
And so it's kind of like,

3070
02:30:17,181 --> 02:30:19,200
that's a nice story to tell.
Yes,

3071
02:30:19,490 --> 02:30:20,780
but it's not,
it's not true,

3072
02:30:21,050 --> 02:30:24,710
but that's the problem is that you're 
not dealing with reality.

3073
02:30:24,760 --> 02:30:25,340
You're,
you're,

3074
02:30:25,370 --> 02:30:27,440
you're,
you're into this weird fantasy land that

3075
02:30:27,441 --> 02:30:32,441
opens you up to massive amounts of 
criticism from people that might be 

3076
02:30:32,441 --> 02:30:33,200
discriminatory instead of saying,
yeah,

3077
02:30:33,201 --> 02:30:35,750
this is problematic and weird and 
strange,

3078
02:30:35,780 --> 02:30:38,510
and the whole thing is weird.
Instead of saying that saying,

3079
02:30:38,511 --> 02:30:39,620
no,
she's always been a woman.

3080
02:30:39,640 --> 02:30:43,320
Well the fuck does that mean it's such a
blanket statement to write,

3081
02:30:43,460 --> 02:30:48,460
but it's a wonderful thing to do to shut
down all rational critique of this 

3082
02:30:48,460 --> 02:30:50,690
situation.
It's a wonderful way to do it.

3083
02:30:50,750 --> 02:30:52,050
She's always been a woman.
Like,

3084
02:30:52,850 --> 02:30:53,390
really?

3085
02:30:54,290 --> 02:30:55,940
That's the only way they can win too 
though.

3086
02:30:55,970 --> 02:30:58,310
Because if you actually enter into a 
conversation,

3087
02:30:58,340 --> 02:31:00,780
you have to actually think about your 
position right now.

3088
02:31:00,800 --> 02:31:02,750
Actually think of ways to argue with the
other person.

3089
02:31:02,751 --> 02:31:04,520
And that takes effort.
Yes.

3090
02:31:04,550 --> 02:31:08,090
So it's a lot easier just to simply say 
they were wrong and you can't argue with

3091
02:31:08,091 --> 02:31:10,460
someone's lived experience.
It doesn't just take effort.

3092
02:31:10,480 --> 02:31:10,680
It's

3093
02:31:10,680 --> 02:31:13,770
also an acknowledgement of the oddity of
the situation.

3094
02:31:13,820 --> 02:31:16,370
Like there's you have to take into 
account,

3095
02:31:16,380 --> 02:31:21,380
like if you're,
if you're not committed to one side or 

3096
02:31:21,380 --> 02:31:21,480
the and you're looking at it for what it
really is,

3097
02:31:21,990 --> 02:31:23,400
you really have to go,
wow.

3098
02:31:23,401 --> 02:31:26,850
It's so strange.
Like be open minded,

3099
02:31:26,851 --> 02:31:31,851
be accepting,
be completely embracing of all oddities,

3100
02:31:34,980 --> 02:31:37,610
strange,
different variables of the,

3101
02:31:37,620 --> 02:31:41,280
the,
the broad spectrum of human sexuality.

3102
02:31:41,550 --> 02:31:46,550
Be Open to all of it,
but also be aware of how fucking weird 

3103
02:31:46,550 --> 02:31:49,530
it is because it is weird.
It's not.

3104
02:31:49,660 --> 02:31:53,250
You don't have to have hate in your 
heart to recognize that.

3105
02:31:53,251 --> 02:31:55,950
It's strange to see a guy with a beard 
breastfeeding,

3106
02:31:56,030 --> 02:31:56,920
right?
Yeah.

3107
02:31:56,970 --> 02:31:58,260
You know,
or fully pregnant.

3108
02:31:58,470 --> 02:32:01,590
It's fucking strange.
I mean it just is.

3109
02:32:01,800 --> 02:32:03,930
Then I think if you're a curious person 
too,

3110
02:32:03,960 --> 02:32:08,960
you know,
you want to learn more and you want to 

3111
02:32:08,960 --> 02:32:10,670
ask questions,
but like in the climate now you can't 

3112
02:32:10,670 --> 02:32:10,670
even do that even if your heart isn't a 
good place.

3113
02:32:10,670 --> 02:32:14,870
Yeah.
But it's hard for people to know that 

3114
02:32:14,870 --> 02:32:17,091
your heart is in a good place.
It's just part of the problem when you 

3115
02:32:17,091 --> 02:32:18,210
know you don't fall in line with the 
accepted narrative.

3116
02:32:18,450 --> 02:32:19,620
People think,
well,

3117
02:32:19,650 --> 02:32:24,650
oh,
it must be because you're conservative 

3118
02:32:24,650 --> 02:32:27,891
or you're transphobic or homophobic or 
something wrong where you're not on 

3119
02:32:27,891 --> 02:32:29,640
board with the way people are thinking 
today.

3120
02:32:29,730 --> 02:32:34,560
You're stuck in the past and that it's 
on the wrong side of history.

3121
02:32:34,620 --> 02:32:36,900
That's a good one.
But it's just,

3122
02:32:37,140 --> 02:32:41,940
you know,
it's hard to fully express your feelings

3123
02:32:41,941 --> 02:32:43,260
on nuanced tissues.

3124
02:32:44,080 --> 02:32:44,890
Yeah.
Well,

3125
02:32:44,980 --> 02:32:46,140
it takes effort,
right?

3126
02:32:46,180 --> 02:32:51,180
It takes time and you have to actually 
think about what is your position and 

3127
02:32:51,180 --> 02:32:53,170
you actually have to look at the facts 
and then have a nuance position.

3128
02:32:53,171 --> 02:32:54,610
Because I don't think most of these 
issues,

3129
02:32:54,611 --> 02:32:59,611
you can't just simply go with one side 
or the other across the board or simply 

3130
02:32:59,611 --> 02:33:04,230
go with what sounds nice.
There's usually a lot of other stuff 

3131
02:33:04,230 --> 02:33:04,230
underlying that that needs to kind of be
hashed out.

3132
02:33:04,490 --> 02:33:08,810
What is your transition into academia 
from academia to the,

3133
02:33:08,870 --> 02:33:10,610
you know,
doing what you do now.

3134
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:16,000
Being able to write things and do 
podcasts and be free of that sort of 

3135
02:33:16,791 --> 02:33:17,810
create what has that been like,

3136
02:33:18,380 --> 02:33:20,360
the process or what?
What led me to do it

3137
02:33:20,490 --> 02:33:22,240
both the process.
What law you will,

3138
02:33:22,270 --> 02:33:23,850
you were described what led you to do 
it?

3139
02:33:23,920 --> 02:33:28,920
Okay.
So I just finished my phd last year and 

3140
02:33:28,920 --> 02:33:31,240
the last two years I realized that 
academia changed a lot.

3141
02:33:31,270 --> 02:33:34,540
So when I first two years and I would 
say in the four years I did my phd,

3142
02:33:34,541 --> 02:33:39,541
it changed a lot.
So when I started there are certain 

3143
02:33:39,541 --> 02:33:42,241
topics that were in little taboo but you
could still ask questions and I had 

3144
02:33:42,241 --> 02:33:43,630
planned to stay in academia and continue
being a sex researcher.

3145
02:33:43,760 --> 02:33:48,760
I love sex research,
but I realized as time went on that you 

3146
02:33:48,760 --> 02:33:51,730
can ask important questions anymore and 
especially when it comes to gender,

3147
02:33:51,731 --> 02:33:55,660
sex differences and gender dysphoria.
So at the time,

3148
02:33:55,690 --> 02:34:00,690
um,
with regards to the debate on kids with 

3149
02:34:00,690 --> 02:34:03,721
gender dysphoria there,
every single mainstream news piece in 

3150
02:34:03,721 --> 02:34:06,310
left leaning outlets was saying young 
kids should transition.

3151
02:34:06,730 --> 02:34:11,730
That's the best thing for them.
And so you'd see all this coverage of 

3152
02:34:11,730 --> 02:34:15,360
young kids who had transitioned to the 
opposite sex and their parents were 

3153
02:34:15,360 --> 02:34:17,110
elated,
the kids were doing so well.

3154
02:34:17,960 --> 02:34:19,450
Uh,
but from a scientific perspective,

3155
02:34:19,451 --> 02:34:21,700
that's not what the research shows.
As I said,

3156
02:34:21,701 --> 02:34:25,660
most kids will grow their feelings,
so it's best to just wait and see.

3157
02:34:26,080 --> 02:34:31,080
And so I wrote an op ed about that and 
at the time I wrote it and I sat on it 

3158
02:34:31,241 --> 02:34:36,241
for probably about six months trying to 
decide whether I should really try and 

3159
02:34:36,241 --> 02:34:39,031
get it published because I knew that 
people were gonna be really upset even 

3160
02:34:39,031 --> 02:34:40,060
though I was just talking about the 
scientific literature.

3161
02:34:40,390 --> 02:34:42,490
And I asked my colleagues,
what do you think?

3162
02:34:42,491 --> 02:34:43,690
And they said to me,
I said,

3163
02:34:43,691 --> 02:34:46,210
should I wait until I have tenure to 
publish this?

3164
02:34:46,570 --> 02:34:48,610
And they said,
even if you have tenure,

3165
02:34:48,611 --> 02:34:51,250
it's not going to protect you nowadays.
So,

3166
02:34:51,300 --> 02:34:51,860
uh,
you know,

3167
02:34:51,910 --> 02:34:56,910
I was lucky.
My mentors have always been very 

3168
02:34:56,910 --> 02:34:58,711
supportive of looking at facts and 
looking at the truth and don't worry 

3169
02:34:58,711 --> 02:34:59,680
about whether it's politically incorrect
or not.

3170
02:35:00,040 --> 02:35:02,950
Just say you do a study,
just present what you found,

3171
02:35:02,951 --> 02:35:04,990
don't worry about how people are going 
to take it,

3172
02:35:05,410 --> 02:35:08,950
but not everyone is like that and 
especially even in the hard sciences now

3173
02:35:09,340 --> 02:35:14,340
if you publish the,
I mean it won't even get published now 

3174
02:35:14,340 --> 02:35:16,591
if you find things that are 
controversial because journals don't 

3175
02:35:16,591 --> 02:35:17,620
want to have to deal with that.
The institutions don't want have to deal

3176
02:35:17,621 --> 02:35:22,621
with that,
so I made the decision to publish that 

3177
02:35:22,621 --> 02:35:22,621
op Ed and then from there I said,
well,

3178
02:35:22,621 --> 02:35:24,970
I'm going to see what this journalism 
thing can take me,

3179
02:35:25,420 --> 02:35:27,460
and so now I say whatever I want.

3180
02:35:27,740 --> 02:35:32,740
Well that sort of behavior and that 
thought process is such on their side is

3181
02:35:33,081 --> 02:35:38,081
such a weakening or the foundation of 
critical thinking and the.

3182
02:35:38,750 --> 02:35:43,750
It also comes at the same time as these 
platforms like podcasting and youtube 

3183
02:35:44,721 --> 02:35:49,721
that allows a person like you or like 
Jordan Peterson to now disconnect and 

3184
02:35:51,440 --> 02:35:54,320
have a far larger audience.
Although it is scary.

3185
02:35:54,321 --> 02:35:57,650
There was quite a bit of censorship 
going on with some of those platforms.

3186
02:35:58,010 --> 02:35:59,990
With Youtube.
Yeah.

3187
02:35:59,991 --> 02:36:03,260
Youtube blogs to they they.
They have the cute thing they do.

3188
02:36:03,261 --> 02:36:08,261
They demonetize things.
I'd probably do you monetize this 

3189
02:36:08,261 --> 02:36:08,261
podcast?
For sure.

3190
02:36:08,261 --> 02:36:10,400
They even let you upload it after.
Although let us upload.

3191
02:36:10,401 --> 02:36:12,560
Okay.
But the demonetization,

3192
02:36:12,590 --> 02:36:14,420
especially since we're criticized 
youtube,

3193
02:36:14,900 --> 02:36:19,900
as soon as you criticize you,
that's like one of the best ways to get 

3194
02:36:19,900 --> 02:36:20,630
demonetized from one of their videos is 
to criticize them.

3195
02:36:21,260 --> 02:36:23,720
Yeah,
it's fucking squirrely.

3196
02:36:23,930 --> 02:36:26,660
It's also make people like if you're 
subscribed,

3197
02:36:26,750 --> 02:36:28,880
they don't tell people when videos get 
posted,

3198
02:36:29,240 --> 02:36:30,170
something like that.
Right.

3199
02:36:30,480 --> 02:36:33,390
They do some weird shit.
I don't pay attention,

3200
02:36:33,780 --> 02:36:38,430
just upload it and keep moving,
but I have friends who were there.

3201
02:36:38,431 --> 02:36:43,431
It's their main source of income was 
youtube and videos and advertising for 

3202
02:36:45,751 --> 02:36:50,751
them was a disaster.
Like people that were making a lot of 

3203
02:36:50,751 --> 02:36:53,901
money and then all sudden that money was
cut down to 30 percent of what it used 

3204
02:36:53,901 --> 02:36:55,320
to be and with no,
no clear guidelines.

3205
02:36:55,350 --> 02:37:00,350
The problem with the guidelines is even 
if like say if we have a video and they 

3206
02:37:00,350 --> 02:37:00,350
just decide that they don't like the 
video,

3207
02:37:00,510 --> 02:37:03,900
you can't really protest it.
You can protest it and.

3208
02:37:03,901 --> 02:37:08,901
But then they review it and then they 
uphold their initial ruling and they 

3209
02:37:08,901 --> 02:37:09,840
don't tell you why.
There's no.

3210
02:37:09,870 --> 02:37:10,680
They don't say,
well,

3211
02:37:10,681 --> 02:37:15,681
hey,
you called someone a queer or you did 

3212
02:37:15,681 --> 02:37:15,800
this or no,
no.

3213
02:37:16,100 --> 02:37:17,180
They just say,
yeah,

3214
02:37:17,240 --> 02:37:19,160
this is how it is.
And it's subjective.

3215
02:37:19,210 --> 02:37:24,210
Yeah,
well it's a problem with being a 

3216
02:37:24,210 --> 02:37:26,921
monopoly and they're not a monopoly in 
the fact that there's not other video 

3217
02:37:26,921 --> 02:37:30,341
platforms,
but there are certainly the largest by 

3218
02:37:30,341 --> 02:37:31,960
far in terms of like user uploaded video
platforms.

3219
02:37:31,961 --> 02:37:34,970
There's not even a close second,
which is kinda weird.

3220
02:37:35,090 --> 02:37:36,920
It's amazing that they've done it,
you know,

3221
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:40,040
I mean,
there's nothing remotely like it.

3222
02:37:40,041 --> 02:37:45,041
I know a bunch of people thought about 
building one and I've been contacted by 

3223
02:37:45,041 --> 02:37:47,740
people that are starting up a new one.
They want me to join that and like,

3224
02:37:48,020 --> 02:37:50,150
good luck,
good luck.

3225
02:37:50,151 --> 02:37:51,920
I mean,
youtube is so far ahead.

3226
02:37:52,270 --> 02:37:53,660
It's like,
how do you catch up to them?

3227
02:37:54,210 --> 02:37:56,900
And I don't think they're evil by any 
stretch of the imagination.

3228
02:37:57,230 --> 02:38:02,230
And uh,
I had a conversation with someone about 

3229
02:38:02,230 --> 02:38:02,960
it pretty recently where she was 
describing that they're really,

3230
02:38:03,200 --> 02:38:08,200
they're,
they're using crude tools and this is 

3231
02:38:08,200 --> 02:38:12,461
part of the problem with what,
what is being deemed as censorship is 

3232
02:38:13,521 --> 02:38:18,521
really they're trying to root out hate 
speech and they're doing so with crude 

3233
02:38:18,521 --> 02:38:22,460
tools that will eventually through ai 
get better and better.

3234
02:38:22,540 --> 02:38:27,540
Is that it though,
or is it that they're trying to shut 

3235
02:38:27,540 --> 02:38:27,540
down any sort of dissenting points of 
view?

3236
02:38:27,600 --> 02:38:28,570
I don't know.
You know,

3237
02:38:28,640 --> 02:38:32,810
I think they definitely lean hard left.
They definitely do.

3238
02:38:32,811 --> 02:38:34,670
So does google.
They lean hard left.

3239
02:38:34,671 --> 02:38:38,360
That was proven by the paper and the,
you know,

3240
02:38:38,390 --> 02:38:41,150
how it was received,
the memo

3241
02:38:41,590 --> 02:38:42,190
actually,
you know what,

3242
02:38:42,191 --> 02:38:47,191
because I was doing youtube for a bit 
and then I stopped just because I 

3243
02:38:47,191 --> 02:38:47,740
unfortunately didn't have time because 
my writing is like my number one thing.

3244
02:38:47,741 --> 02:38:50,770
But I had one video that minute it went 
up.

3245
02:38:50,860 --> 02:38:53,160
I was talking about science on gender 
dysphoria.

3246
02:38:53,180 --> 02:38:55,600
Got Demonetized literally like 20 
minutes.

3247
02:38:56,110 --> 02:38:56,920
And I thought,
Oh,

3248
02:38:57,030 --> 02:38:58,840
you know,
I know what my intentions are.

3249
02:38:58,841 --> 02:39:01,120
And it's really unsettling when that 
happens.

3250
02:39:01,420 --> 02:39:06,420
It will,
it should be because you're not doing 

3251
02:39:06,420 --> 02:39:09,040
anything hateful know,
and what they're doing is they're trying

3252
02:39:09,041 --> 02:39:14,041
to make subjects much less attractive to
discuss [inaudible] and who's doing it.

3253
02:39:16,390 --> 02:39:21,390
I mean is it doing it through crude 
tools or someone looking at it and 

3254
02:39:21,390 --> 02:39:25,831
flagging it and deciding that this is 
not something they want to be involved 

3255
02:39:25,831 --> 02:39:29,641
with advertising and in their defense,
a lot of this got started off by people 

3256
02:39:30,461 --> 02:39:35,461
that were really doing fucked up things 
on youtube and they had to respond and 

3257
02:39:35,461 --> 02:39:40,381
they had to figure out a way to 
eliminate that stuff in their platform 

3258
02:39:40,381 --> 02:39:43,021
and I think once you start censoring,
the tendency is to continue to expand.

3259
02:39:44,350 --> 02:39:46,570
This tendency is not to back off of that
center ship.

3260
02:39:46,840 --> 02:39:49,450
Like you know,
we're just gonna allow Holocaust deniers

3261
02:39:49,451 --> 02:39:54,451
and racists and make your videos.
His Youtube is a wild west baby aren't 

3262
02:39:54,451 --> 02:39:59,110
going to do that because they have 
advertisers and there's a significant 

3263
02:39:59,110 --> 02:39:59,110
amount of revenue that they get from 
that,

3264
02:39:59,110 --> 02:40:00,830
but they don't actually end the 
conversation though.

3265
02:40:00,940 --> 02:40:02,760
People just get upset and they take the 
car.

3266
02:40:02,820 --> 02:40:07,820
They might not be on youtube,
but that people are still talking about 

3267
02:40:07,820 --> 02:40:07,820
these things,
but they're not youtube

3268
02:40:07,820 --> 02:40:09,650
as long as they're not on youtube,
they don't give a shit like,

3269
02:40:09,651 --> 02:40:10,820
yeah,
you're not on youtube.

3270
02:40:10,970 --> 02:40:15,970
Good luck with that conversation on 
Vimeo or wherever you're going to go.

3271
02:40:17,410 --> 02:40:18,600
It's,
um,

3272
02:40:19,020 --> 02:40:20,400
it's,
it's odd.

3273
02:40:20,940 --> 02:40:23,610
But it's also,
I've,

3274
02:40:23,680 --> 02:40:25,740
I love it.
I love that there's these disco.

3275
02:40:25,800 --> 02:40:29,910
I love the law part of me even likes the
fact that things are being censored.

3276
02:40:30,330 --> 02:40:32,190
I really do.
I find it fascinating.

3277
02:40:33,590 --> 02:40:38,590
I feel like the argument is fascinating 
because I think first of all,

3278
02:40:38,791 --> 02:40:43,791
I think censorship clearly causes that.
I think when you push against something,

3279
02:40:44,371 --> 02:40:49,371
there's a natural reaction.
That reaction is to bolster your 

3280
02:40:49,371 --> 02:40:50,010
defenses and fire back up.
And,

3281
02:40:50,011 --> 02:40:55,011
uh,
I think there's certainly some of that 

3282
02:40:55,011 --> 02:40:57,120
going on.
You can't really quiet ideas entirely,

3283
02:40:57,390 --> 02:41:02,390
but you do,
you do expose your intentions and you 

3284
02:41:02,461 --> 02:41:07,461
expose these blind spots that are what 
we've been discussing all day.

3285
02:41:07,740 --> 02:41:12,740
There's this political ideology,
a blind spots that people have these 

3286
02:41:12,751 --> 02:41:16,050
ideological holes that they have and the
way they look at things.

3287
02:41:17,480 --> 02:41:22,480
Question is,
do you want to solve the problem or are 

3288
02:41:22,480 --> 02:41:25,601
you trying to just be successful as a 
business if you want to solve the 

3289
02:41:25,601 --> 02:41:29,501
problem?
I don't think suppressing speech and 

3290
02:41:29,501 --> 02:41:32,800
shutting down people who are genuinely 
just trying to ask questions and have 

3291
02:41:32,800 --> 02:41:36,131
conversations.
I don't think that's going to solve 

3292
02:41:36,131 --> 02:41:36,131
things.

3293
02:41:36,131 --> 02:41:36,131
I don't think they're trying to solve 
any problems.

3294
02:41:36,131 --> 02:41:41,121
I think they're trying to make a ton of 
money and they're also very liberal and 

3295
02:41:41,121 --> 02:41:43,780
they think the right thing to do is to 
suppress certain ideology.

3296
02:41:43,800 --> 02:41:46,480
They deemed harmful or hate speech.
You know,

3297
02:41:46,490 --> 02:41:48,420
I had a conversation with a woman as a 
youtube exec.

3298
02:41:48,450 --> 02:41:51,600
She was telling me that Douglas Murray 
and Sam Harris,

3299
02:41:51,940 --> 02:41:55,370
they there this podcast that they did 
online and uh,

3300
02:41:56,220 --> 02:42:01,220
some guy put it up in his playlist and 
he got a community guideline strike for 

3301
02:42:01,891 --> 02:42:04,350
having it in this playlist.
And I said,

3302
02:42:04,351 --> 02:42:05,550
how is that?
And she said,

3303
02:42:05,551 --> 02:42:06,960
it's hate speech.
I said,

3304
02:42:06,961 --> 02:42:09,540
it's his speech speech.
I heard that podcast.

3305
02:42:09,850 --> 02:42:12,180
And not only is it not hate speech,
you didn't watch it.

3306
02:42:12,510 --> 02:42:15,450
She didn't listen to it like she had no 
idea what the fuck it was,

3307
02:42:15,660 --> 02:42:20,310
but she just like confidently said it to
me like I was going to just shut up.

3308
02:42:20,900 --> 02:42:25,900
Like you're out of your fucking mind.
You don't even know what you're talking 

3309
02:42:25,900 --> 02:42:25,900
about.
This is hilarious,

3310
02:42:25,900 --> 02:42:27,390
but it was a person out of pretty high 
level over there.

3311
02:42:27,750 --> 02:42:29,790
So it's interesting to see that like,
okay,

3312
02:42:29,791 --> 02:42:33,570
well this is the kind of a lack of 
critical thinking that we're discussing.

3313
02:42:33,870 --> 02:42:38,870
This is the kind of blind spot that 
we're discussing that you feel like you 

3314
02:42:38,870 --> 02:42:42,750
could just say that instead of 
appreciate that this is to intellectuals

3315
02:42:42,751 --> 02:42:46,350
discussing something that's very complex
and that is,

3316
02:42:46,650 --> 02:42:51,650
it was about immigration and about Islam
and those are two things that people 

3317
02:42:51,901 --> 02:42:53,280
don't want to hear.
You know,

3318
02:42:53,281 --> 02:42:56,400
they just like go.
Those two things are off limits.

3319
02:42:56,401 --> 02:42:59,280
Unless you're a pro Islam or pro 
immigration,

3320
02:42:59,730 --> 02:43:02,490
you better shut the fuck up or we're 
going to demonetize you and that,

3321
02:43:02,910 --> 02:43:06,930
that kind of censorship is fascinating 
to me because it's not effective.

3322
02:43:07,350 --> 02:43:08,460
It's,
it just,

3323
02:43:08,610 --> 02:43:10,350
it just makes people go,
hey,

3324
02:43:10,680 --> 02:43:12,380
and you know,
and then it,

3325
02:43:12,430 --> 02:43:17,430
it makes the people on the youtube side 
get defensive and it makes them double 

3326
02:43:17,621 --> 02:43:19,480
down and you know,
and you're seeing,

3327
02:43:20,710 --> 02:43:22,870
you see that now.
I mean,

3328
02:43:22,871 --> 02:43:25,750
you see it with many people.
It's,

3329
02:43:26,380 --> 02:43:29,670
it's a weird time for ideas.
Yeah.

3330
02:43:30,280 --> 02:43:32,350
How do you feel about being part of the 
Idw,

3331
02:43:34,090 --> 02:43:35,890
the international dark web?

3332
02:43:38,190 --> 02:43:40,810
Um,
I'm the least mentioned,

3333
02:43:40,811 --> 02:43:44,080
happily the least mentioned person in 
that group.

3334
02:43:44,110 --> 02:43:46,960
I'm very happy about that.
I don't like being in any groups.

3335
02:43:47,970 --> 02:43:50,120
Would a,
Groucho Marx once a,

3336
02:43:50,410 --> 02:43:55,410
uh,
I don't want to be a part of any club 

3337
02:43:55,410 --> 02:43:57,121
that would have me look.
I'm very happy to be able to have a 

3338
02:43:58,031 --> 02:44:02,080
platform where I can have people like 
you on or any of those people,

3339
02:44:02,081 --> 02:44:05,680
whether it's Bret Weinstein or Eric 
Weinstein Stein,

3340
02:44:05,710 --> 02:44:09,070
sorry guys.
Bret Weinstein era after harvey.

3341
02:44:09,100 --> 02:44:12,640
Everybody got real.
He's really sweet.

3342
02:44:12,641 --> 02:44:16,120
He's great.
And his wife Heather is amazing as well.

3343
02:44:16,150 --> 02:44:18,250
He'll be on actually the next season of 
wrong speak.

3344
02:44:18,520 --> 02:44:21,650
Oh cool.
Heather hiding his wife is amazing too.

3345
02:44:22,240 --> 02:44:26,940
And they were on together and Sam Harris
is a good friend and I love that guy.

3346
02:44:27,070 --> 02:44:29,380
He's a fascinating person.
And as,

3347
02:44:29,381 --> 02:44:34,381
as Jordan and a look,
I don't agree with a lot of what Ben 

3348
02:44:34,381 --> 02:44:38,460
Shapiro says.
He's a super nice guy and I really like 

3349
02:44:38,460 --> 02:44:38,460
them,
you know?

3350
02:44:38,460 --> 02:44:38,460
And that's,
that's.

3351
02:44:38,460 --> 02:44:39,670
You saw that thing that happened with 
that actor.

3352
02:44:39,730 --> 02:44:42,130
Mark was the same mark duplass.
Is that a same,

3353
02:44:42,430 --> 02:44:47,430
got in trouble for tweeting that?
A very nice and reasonable person.

3354
02:44:47,920 --> 02:44:50,140
Yeah.
Yeah.

3355
02:44:50,141 --> 02:44:54,650
It's a fun time.
Ben Is really nice too.

3356
02:44:54,880 --> 02:44:56,890
He's a really nice guy,
you know,

3357
02:44:56,980 --> 02:44:59,980
I liked them a lot.
This internet,

3358
02:45:00,490 --> 02:45:02,110
whatever it is,
the dark web thing,

3359
02:45:02,880 --> 02:45:07,880
that's all eric.
Eric Weinstein's idea was to name this 

3360
02:45:07,880 --> 02:45:08,380
and label.
He loves all that Shit.

3361
02:45:08,381 --> 02:45:10,840
He loves all that cloak and dagger 
stuff.

3362
02:45:10,870 --> 02:45:15,870
He gets kicked out of it,
but he makes some very good points and 

3363
02:45:15,870 --> 02:45:15,870
he's a brilliant,
brilliant guy.

3364
02:45:15,870 --> 02:45:20,730
And um,
this idea that we're all joined 

3365
02:45:20,730 --> 02:45:20,730
together.
I mean we all went,

3366
02:45:20,730 --> 02:45:22,090
uh,
we had a big dinner together,

3367
02:45:22,091 --> 02:45:26,200
like a bunch of dorks and we all got 
together and were like this little club.

3368
02:45:26,720 --> 02:45:31,720
And that's kind of fun and we're going 
to do it again and we're bringing more 

3369
02:45:31,720 --> 02:45:32,620
people into bringing more people into 
the dark web.

3370
02:45:34,750 --> 02:45:38,290
Some people are resentful that they're 
not a part of the dark web and I'll tell

3371
02:45:38,291 --> 02:45:43,291
you some names afterwards,
but some people like contacted Barry 

3372
02:45:43,291 --> 02:45:44,830
Weiss and were upset that they weren't 
included in the dark web.

3373
02:45:46,260 --> 02:45:48,700
I loved berries column.
It was interesting.

3374
02:45:49,360 --> 02:45:52,080
It's the whole but the label of it all.
I mean it's.

3375
02:45:52,330 --> 02:45:54,760
What's interesting is it,
it starts this conversation,

3376
02:45:54,761 --> 02:45:57,790
right?
So why is it even necessary to have this

3377
02:45:57,791 --> 02:45:59,770
dark web and what's the function of this
dark web?

3378
02:45:59,820 --> 02:46:04,820
What is this?
What is the dark web doing really like 

3379
02:46:04,820 --> 02:46:04,820
what is,
you know,

3380
02:46:04,820 --> 02:46:09,030
and there was an article today where 
someone was calling it problematic and 

3381
02:46:09,030 --> 02:46:10,160
saying that it's mostly right people,
which is

3382
02:46:10,250 --> 02:46:14,840
absolutely not true.
Sam Harris very left Bret Weinstein,

3383
02:46:14,841 --> 02:46:17,540
fiercely progressive.
Eric very left.

3384
02:46:18,530 --> 02:46:23,530
I'm way more left than I am,
right to the very few right wing ideas 

3385
02:46:24,921 --> 02:46:27,110
that I hold onto the very small.
It was very.

3386
02:46:27,440 --> 02:46:31,550
The vast majority of my positions on 
things side with,

3387
02:46:31,820 --> 02:46:34,550
with people on the left,
vast majority,

3388
02:46:34,990 --> 02:46:37,160
I'm Ben Shapiro,
was very right,

3389
02:46:37,820 --> 02:46:39,360
but he's reasonable,
you know,

3390
02:46:39,370 --> 02:46:42,020
and he's also a young guy,
you know,

3391
02:46:42,710 --> 02:46:46,250
conservative religious.
It's,

3392
02:46:46,290 --> 02:46:49,910
but he's also extremely intelligent and 
reasonable.

3393
02:46:50,260 --> 02:46:55,260
Talked to him and he has himself 
disavowed some of the things that he 

3394
02:46:57,891 --> 02:47:01,340
said and he's,
he's himself criticized his own words.

3395
02:47:01,640 --> 02:47:06,640
He wrote a whole column.
Here's a list of all the stupid things 

3396
02:47:06,640 --> 02:47:07,460
I've ever said online because he's,
he's,

3397
02:47:07,461 --> 02:47:09,140
you know,
he's a very aware guy,

3398
02:47:09,170 --> 02:47:11,990
very self aware.
I think,

3399
02:47:12,110 --> 02:47:17,110
um,
I think it's important to have 

3400
02:47:17,110 --> 02:47:20,651
discussions and I think it's important 
that when people feel like those 

3401
02:47:20,651 --> 02:47:23,270
discussions are being suppressed,
that they talk about that.

3402
02:47:23,630 --> 02:47:25,430
And I think that's what this whole thing
is.

3403
02:47:25,640 --> 02:47:27,260
And I think you're a part of that as 
well.

3404
02:47:27,350 --> 02:47:28,430
I was in the column.
Yeah,

3405
02:47:28,550 --> 02:47:33,550
we could use you in the dark web,
a woman of color that you guys aren't 

3406
02:47:34,011 --> 02:47:37,820
all racist much white people.
God Damn it.

3407
02:47:37,821 --> 02:47:42,320
I took a 23 and me and I'm hoping I've 
got some black and Korean.

3408
02:47:42,380 --> 02:47:47,380
I'm hoping for you to give me some.
Give me more than five percent.

3409
02:47:47,750 --> 02:47:52,750
What is it that you have to have?
I think you only have to have like one 

3410
02:47:52,750 --> 02:47:55,100
slash 16th native American to catch a 
check and some places.

3411
02:47:55,580 --> 02:47:57,920
I'm not sure what it is in Canada,
but something like that.

3412
02:47:58,080 --> 02:47:59,450
Yeah.
Yeah.

3413
02:47:59,451 --> 02:48:04,451
Like if you go fishing in,
in Canada and you're a first nation,

3414
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:10,000
if you have an a what the number is,
but you could bring as many fish as you 

3415
02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:14,051
want,
but like if you like I was fishing in 

3416
02:48:14,051 --> 02:48:15,080
Canada in a place where I could only get
one Walleye a day.

3417
02:48:15,320 --> 02:48:20,320
You only get one,
but there was some dude next to me was 

3418
02:48:20,320 --> 02:48:20,320
first nations.
Homeboy was just pulling them in.

3419
02:48:20,430 --> 02:48:23,420
Dr Wright and sticking them in a bucket.
Clean it up.

3420
02:48:23,510 --> 02:48:25,280
So you better be hoping on that test 
then.

3421
02:48:25,520 --> 02:48:26,990
I'm hoping.
I'm hoping I'm praying.

3422
02:48:27,380 --> 02:48:28,940
I just want to be discriminated against.

3423
02:48:31,220 --> 02:48:33,860
One 16th is one great great 
grandparents.

3424
02:48:34,070 --> 02:48:35,030
Oh,
that's all you need.

3425
02:48:35,160 --> 02:48:40,160
That's all I need.
Somebody come on chimp in your family 

3426
02:48:40,160 --> 02:48:40,160
too.
For sure.

3427
02:48:40,210 --> 02:48:41,990
Somebody fucked a champ.
This is what I think.

3428
02:48:41,991 --> 02:48:44,900
I think if people evolved from lower 
hominids,

3429
02:48:44,930 --> 02:48:46,400
right,
that's what happened.

3430
02:48:46,430 --> 02:48:48,830
That if you believe all that evolution 
nonsense,

3431
02:48:48,860 --> 02:48:50,600
nonsense,
no one believes that anymore.

3432
02:48:50,601 --> 02:48:51,490
It's pseudoscience.
Yeah.

3433
02:48:51,500 --> 02:48:56,500
It's a bunch of pseudo science,
but I think that somewhere in my 

3434
02:48:56,500 --> 02:49:00,700
ancestry,
somebody went back in for one more shot 

3435
02:49:00,700 --> 02:49:03,730
chimp when they probably shouldn't have 
somebody said I was going to know.

3436
02:49:04,280 --> 02:49:07,010
They probably got drunk.
No judgment,

3437
02:49:07,050 --> 02:49:10,560
no judgment.
And clearly evolution is not.

3438
02:49:10,740 --> 02:49:14,850
It's not a fucking straight flat plane.
Right.

3439
02:49:15,090 --> 02:49:16,100
It varies.
Yeah.

3440
02:49:17,450 --> 02:49:19,160
You can't deny the influence of it,

3441
02:49:20,080 --> 02:49:21,100
you know,
that's some people do.

3442
02:49:21,370 --> 02:49:23,380
Yeah.
Well,

3443
02:49:24,440 --> 02:49:29,440
I dunno.
What do you think about all this dark 

3444
02:49:29,440 --> 02:49:29,440
web stuff?

3445
02:49:29,440 --> 02:49:30,570
Um,
I,

3446
02:49:30,720 --> 02:49:32,490
I felt,
I mean,

3447
02:49:32,491 --> 02:49:37,491
the fact that the New York Times covered
it give me a sense of relief because 

3448
02:49:37,491 --> 02:49:40,860
sometimes the things I write,
I don't feel like the things I write are

3449
02:49:40,861 --> 02:49:44,850
that controversial or that offensive.
But the response I get sometimes,

3450
02:49:44,851 --> 02:49:45,960
I'm surprised

3451
02:49:46,510 --> 02:49:48,670
you said this as,
as a journalist,

3452
02:49:48,671 --> 02:49:51,040
as a journalist,
as intellectual,

3453
02:49:51,041 --> 02:49:53,100
as a person who actually understands 
what you're talking.

3454
02:49:53,260 --> 02:49:55,040
Yeah.
Especially someone who has studied,

3455
02:49:55,041 --> 02:49:58,370
especially these certain topics within 
research,

3456
02:49:58,670 --> 02:50:03,670
I think I know what I'm talking about,
and so when people get really mad it 

3457
02:50:03,670 --> 02:50:05,510
makes you question where are we going?
So the fact that,

3458
02:50:05,630 --> 02:50:10,630
you know,
Barry covered this and I'm that the 

3459
02:50:10,630 --> 02:50:10,630
response was so positive.
I mean,

3460
02:50:10,630 --> 02:50:11,270
people got mad too.
Oh,

3461
02:50:11,340 --> 02:50:13,450
people got mad at her.
She's taken a lot of heat.

3462
02:50:13,460 --> 02:50:14,150
Yeah.
Yeah,

3463
02:50:14,151 --> 02:50:15,860
definitely a lot.
Yeah.

3464
02:50:16,310 --> 02:50:19,900
But I feel a little bit more optimistic 
because it,

3465
02:50:20,060 --> 02:50:24,140
it tells me that people get it,
that we have conversations like this and

3466
02:50:24,141 --> 02:50:28,430
people don't think that we're bigoted or
that were coming from.

3467
02:50:28,490 --> 02:50:30,790
We have a nefarious agenda,
right?

3468
02:50:31,100 --> 02:50:36,100
We just want to have conversations and 
talk about things that aren't being 

3469
02:50:36,100 --> 02:50:36,100
discussed in the mainstream.

3470
02:50:36,940 --> 02:50:41,940
Yeah.
That's where censorship becomes very 

3471
02:50:41,940 --> 02:50:44,221
dangerous if you do silence a lot of 
these conversations and right now 

3472
02:50:44,221 --> 02:50:45,520
they're not being silenced even though 
they're,

3473
02:50:45,910 --> 02:50:48,340
they're being democratized to a certain 
extent.

3474
02:50:49,480 --> 02:50:54,280
That is a problem,
but the conversation still exists and as

3475
02:50:54,281 --> 02:50:59,281
long as they do still existent,
the vast majority exist in audio form 

3476
02:50:59,651 --> 02:51:04,651
anyway.
And podcasting is the vast majority of 

3477
02:51:04,651 --> 02:51:08,311
the volume of people that are 
downloading these kinds of 

3478
02:51:08,311 --> 02:51:11,131
conversations.
I think it's an incredibly unique time 

3479
02:51:11,231 --> 02:51:14,620
for the distribution of ideas.
I don't think there's ever any ever been

3480
02:51:14,621 --> 02:51:17,680
anything remotely like this in human 
history.

3481
02:51:18,190 --> 02:51:22,630
There's never been a time where someone 
like me can just do something,

3482
02:51:22,930 --> 02:51:27,930
uh,
just on a laptop with a Webcam and then 

3483
02:51:27,930 --> 02:51:30,860
nine years later it's this,
you know,

3484
02:51:30,910 --> 02:51:34,840
we're just fucking nuts and I don't 
even.

3485
02:51:35,480 --> 02:51:40,480
I'm aware of it,
but I don't even think about it that 

3486
02:51:40,480 --> 02:51:40,720
much honestly.
I just do it.

3487
02:51:40,810 --> 02:51:42,710
I'm,
I was excited to talk to you today.

3488
02:51:42,711 --> 02:51:45,690
I was looking forward to it.
I was excited to too.

3489
02:51:46,840 --> 02:51:51,840
But I don't,
I don't give it much consideration as 

3490
02:51:51,850 --> 02:51:54,460
far as the impact because I think as 
soon as you do that,

3491
02:51:54,610 --> 02:51:59,050
it'll slip through your fingers.
Like if you think too much about it.

3492
02:51:59,260 --> 02:52:00,130
Yeah.
Well,

3493
02:52:00,131 --> 02:52:02,290
I definitely wouldn't say half the Shit 
I've already said today.

3494
02:52:02,920 --> 02:52:03,850
Right.
That's,

3495
02:52:04,790 --> 02:52:06,040
that's appeal

3496
02:52:06,040 --> 02:52:08,920
though.
The appeal is that you and I,

3497
02:52:09,010 --> 02:52:11,830
I really believe this.
If there was no microphone,

3498
02:52:11,920 --> 02:52:16,920
we probably would never have this 
conversation because it's too difficult 

3499
02:52:16,920 --> 02:52:17,200
to sit.
It would be too weird like you and I was

3500
02:52:17,201 --> 02:52:18,910
just going to sit down and just talk to 
each other.

3501
02:52:18,920 --> 02:52:22,900
Was came in and met you and we sat down.
Would be weird,

3502
02:52:23,740 --> 02:52:28,740
like you almost have to have this where 
people could see it to do it because 

3503
02:52:28,740 --> 02:52:30,960
otherwise you'd check your phone.
I check my phone,

3504
02:52:31,000 --> 02:52:32,500
get up,
go to the bathroom.

3505
02:52:32,501 --> 02:52:34,510
It's like it would be a normal thing to 
do,

3506
02:52:34,690 --> 02:52:39,690
but by putting these headphones on and 
by having this microphone in front of 

3507
02:52:39,690 --> 02:52:43,231
our face,
we lock in and know that how many 

3508
02:52:43,231 --> 02:52:43,231
million people are going to be watching 
fuck load.

3509
02:52:43,600 --> 02:52:48,600
It's more every week.
It's growing in a weird way like a 

3510
02:52:48,600 --> 02:52:49,090
fucking mold.

3511
02:52:49,120 --> 02:52:50,500
It's amazing.
Strange,

3512
02:52:50,710 --> 02:52:55,710
but this is the only way we would have 
this conversation and it's made me far 

3513
02:52:55,710 --> 02:53:00,091
better at talking to people and 
understanding conversations and 

3514
02:53:00,091 --> 02:53:03,751
understanding what they are and also 
examining my own speech patterns and the

3515
02:53:03,911 --> 02:53:06,610
way I communicate and getting better at 
it.

3516
02:53:06,700 --> 02:53:10,000
I like how you said you started it just 
because you wanted to talk to people.

3517
02:53:10,090 --> 02:53:15,090
Like I think that's what it should be.
It should just be that interest in 

3518
02:53:15,090 --> 02:53:15,290
having a conversation.
Well,

3519
02:53:15,350 --> 02:53:18,100
I used to like doing radio when I was a 
guest,

3520
02:53:18,230 --> 02:53:20,650
you know,
uncertain radio shows,

3521
02:53:20,651 --> 02:53:21,700
you know,
like you do.

3522
02:53:21,701 --> 02:53:26,530
Like if I was going to go to phoenix or 
something like that,

3523
02:53:27,030 --> 02:53:32,030
I would go do stand up there.
I would have to promote it on the radio 

3524
02:53:32,030 --> 02:53:35,131
and the old days and I would get there 
and I would get there early and you 

3525
02:53:35,131 --> 02:53:36,190
know,
smoke a joint beforehand,

3526
02:53:36,250 --> 02:53:41,250
drink a cup of coffee and get in and 
start talking shit and having a good 

3527
02:53:41,250 --> 02:53:41,250
time and laughing and be like,
oh,

3528
02:53:41,250 --> 02:53:42,950
that'd be fun to have a radio show man,
you know,

3529
02:53:42,970 --> 02:53:45,010
just go in there and just talk and have 
fun.

3530
02:53:45,190 --> 02:53:48,040
But the problem was to me it was like 
always the censorship.

3531
02:53:48,041 --> 02:53:48,700
I was like,
Oh,

3532
02:53:49,000 --> 02:53:54,000
you got to censor yourself.
Then I started doing the open anthony 

3533
02:53:54,000 --> 02:53:57,010
show and opie and anthony had a show on,
you know as first if it was Xm,

3534
02:53:57,011 --> 02:54:00,580
then it became serious and and then they
split up,

3535
02:54:00,640 --> 02:54:05,410
but when I would do that it was opie and
Anthony and Jim Norton and I was like,

3536
02:54:05,500 --> 02:54:09,850
this is the best,
this is so fun and the way they did it,

3537
02:54:10,150 --> 02:54:15,150
credit to them,
the way they did it was different than 

3538
02:54:15,150 --> 02:54:17,680
any radio show at ever been a part of 
because it was no structure at all.

3539
02:54:17,681 --> 02:54:22,681
They would just bring comics in.
It would just be me and Ari should fear 

3540
02:54:22,681 --> 02:54:24,100
and bill burr and Joey Diaz and all 
these guys.

3541
02:54:24,310 --> 02:54:26,980
They would just come in and hang out and
talk shit.

3542
02:54:27,160 --> 02:54:29,290
There was no structure at all.

3543
02:54:29,590 --> 02:54:32,470
It was just.
Anthony is such a smart and funny guide.

3544
02:54:32,490 --> 02:54:37,490
Opie would sort of run the thing and and
Jim was there and they would just let 

3545
02:54:37,490 --> 02:54:39,010
everybody talk and I'd be like,
this would be amazing.

3546
02:54:39,400 --> 02:54:44,400
You could just come in and hang out and 
have fun and then I'm done.

3547
02:54:45,731 --> 02:54:50,731
I started doing a podcast after that,
but it was because of that and then 

3548
02:54:50,731 --> 02:54:52,360
anthony did a thing called live from the
compound.

3549
02:54:52,361 --> 02:54:55,720
He calls his house the compound and he 
did like this thing in his basement.

3550
02:54:55,721 --> 02:55:00,721
We had a green screen and he did his own
show and he did Karaoke while he's 

3551
02:55:00,721 --> 02:55:01,360
holding a machine gun.
He's fucking crazy.

3552
02:55:01,630 --> 02:55:05,750
Anthony is like a legit gun nut,
but he had a studio that he built in his

3553
02:55:05,751 --> 02:55:09,110
basement with like legitimate equipment 
and I went,

3554
02:55:09,170 --> 02:55:12,230
oh,
and that inspired me and that,

3555
02:55:12,330 --> 02:55:15,800
that is literally what started me off to
do a podcast.

3556
02:55:15,801 --> 02:55:19,420
The scene that he had set this up in his
basement and I was like,

3557
02:55:19,460 --> 02:55:21,830
don't just fucking just start doing it.
Yeah.

3558
02:55:22,660 --> 02:55:23,740
Wow.
Yeah.

3559
02:55:24,550 --> 02:55:27,010
I was going to say the same thing.
I feel the wrong speed.

3560
02:55:27,040 --> 02:55:30,910
The fact that I can see people being 
mommed and I can think,

3561
02:55:30,940 --> 02:55:35,940
okay,
I wonder what they're like and I can 

3562
02:55:35,940 --> 02:55:36,430
just ask them like,
is that what it's like for you?

3563
02:55:36,431 --> 02:55:38,470
You see someone you think,
I just want to talk to them?

3564
02:55:38,690 --> 02:55:40,340
Oh yeah,
yeah.

3565
02:55:40,400 --> 02:55:44,690
Especially someone in a controversial 
position like Jordan,

3566
02:55:44,720 --> 02:55:49,720
like when I first met Jordan,
it's like when he was just starting to 

3567
02:55:50,390 --> 02:55:53,540
get some attention online and I wanted 
to talk to them,

3568
02:55:53,541 --> 02:55:54,020
I was like,
well,

3569
02:55:54,021 --> 02:55:57,650
what is going on here and why?
Why is everybody be up so upset at you?

3570
02:55:57,651 --> 02:56:02,651
And I've never met anyone in in all my 
life who is so purposely misrepresented 

3571
02:56:05,120 --> 02:56:06,940
by other people than Jordan.
Yeah,

3572
02:56:07,190 --> 02:56:08,340
I've never seen it before.
It's,

3573
02:56:08,390 --> 02:56:13,390
it's amazing to see intelligent,
articulate people clearly lying about 

3574
02:56:15,441 --> 02:56:20,441
his positions,
about how and not and not even 

3575
02:56:20,441 --> 02:56:24,521
understanding that by doing that they're
strengthening him and they're 

3576
02:56:24,521 --> 02:56:28,721
strengthening their.
You're not going to lie to the point 

3577
02:56:28,721 --> 02:56:30,800
where people are going to really

3578
02:56:31,930 --> 02:56:36,930
think that your position is correct and 
all these things that Jordan has said 

3579
02:56:37,150 --> 02:56:42,150
that somehow or another you misheard 
them or the whole world ms dot heard 

3580
02:56:42,150 --> 02:56:42,150
them.
Oh,

3581
02:56:42,150 --> 02:56:47,070
you're misrepresenting his positions and
that just makes all the people that are 

3582
02:56:47,441 --> 02:56:50,170
siding with him realize he's right.
Yeah.

3583
02:56:50,320 --> 02:56:55,320
It strengthened Sam.
They literally don't understand that 

3584
02:56:55,320 --> 02:56:57,640
they are his publicists.
They are helping.

3585
02:56:57,860 --> 02:57:01,600
They are proving his point and to the 
point where he's selling out.

3586
02:57:02,140 --> 02:57:07,140
He sold out gigantic 5,000
seat theaters.

3587
02:57:07,691 --> 02:57:10,000
Yeah.
He's selling them out all over the world

3588
02:57:10,210 --> 02:57:12,670
just talking.
It's crazy.

3589
02:57:12,671 --> 02:57:16,570
He's making millions of dollars because 
of them being stupid.

3590
02:57:16,900 --> 02:57:21,900
It's fucking amazing.
It's really amazing and all of it came 

3591
02:57:22,511 --> 02:57:27,511
out of him putting his foot down in 
opposition to the very same things that 

3592
02:57:28,861 --> 02:57:33,861
you experienced that forced you to leave
academia is misrepresenting of reality.

3593
02:57:34,620 --> 02:57:39,180
That seems to be going in and I think 
it's fueling the.

3594
02:57:39,360 --> 02:57:42,990
It's certainly fueling the dark web,
but on top of that,

3595
02:57:43,570 --> 02:57:47,080
these people are seeing that they can't 
trust what they're being told.

3596
02:57:47,140 --> 02:57:47,590
Yeah,

3597
02:57:48,390 --> 02:57:48,960
they are.

3598
02:57:50,910 --> 02:57:53,220
They can't trust what they're being told
and they.

3599
02:57:53,221 --> 02:57:56,100
They understand that there's other 
conversation to be had out there.

3600
02:57:56,520 --> 02:57:59,820
There was an article that I tweeted 
today that was really interesting.

3601
02:57:59,850 --> 02:58:00,450
I was like,
wow,

3602
02:58:00,451 --> 02:58:05,451
this is crazy.
It was talking about long form podcasts 

3603
02:58:05,451 --> 02:58:10,310
and the ability that longform podcast 
have to allow people to have rational 

3604
02:58:14,160 --> 02:58:19,160
civil discourse instead of just like 
getting on these fucking CNN shows and 

3605
02:58:20,191 --> 02:58:23,520
yelling at each other for three minutes,
which is sometimes you get a panel.

3606
02:58:23,521 --> 02:58:25,560
Everyone just agrees with each other.
Yes.

3607
02:58:25,770 --> 02:58:27,720
Yeah.
Or the panels are crazy too.

3608
02:58:28,080 --> 02:58:33,080
How the fuck you going to have nine 
people talking at the same time that 

3609
02:58:33,080 --> 02:58:33,540
it's crazy.
It's hard to do.

3610
02:58:33,541 --> 02:58:35,790
When I do podcasts with two other 
people,

3611
02:58:36,180 --> 02:58:36,900
it's hard.
Well,

3612
02:58:36,901 --> 02:58:41,901
it's entertainment,
but it's not a good way to discuss 

3613
02:58:41,901 --> 02:58:42,180
topics,
you know,

3614
02:58:42,181 --> 02:58:47,181
long form conversations are really the 
only way where you can get a good sense 

3615
02:58:48,150 --> 02:58:52,170
of where someone stands on a position 
and how they think,

3616
02:58:53,070 --> 02:58:55,800
you know,
like I get a chance to see like you like

3617
02:58:55,970 --> 02:58:58,200
and a lot of people are going to get a 
chance to see you today.

3618
02:58:58,590 --> 02:59:00,070
How you think about things,
what,

3619
02:59:00,270 --> 02:59:05,270
what your thought process is,
and if there's holes in that thought 

3620
02:59:05,270 --> 02:59:05,270
process,
they get exposed.

3621
02:59:06,140 --> 02:59:09,300
And that's I think also with issues that
are more complex.

3622
02:59:09,310 --> 02:59:14,310
You can talk about all the different 
nuances to that issue because if you 

3623
02:59:14,310 --> 02:59:16,410
just simply have your talking points and
you sort of.

3624
02:59:16,570 --> 02:59:19,380
If you do like a standard interview 
that's say seven minutes long,

3625
02:59:20,040 --> 02:59:25,040
it's going to be very,
very sparse in terms of what you're 

3626
02:59:25,040 --> 02:59:25,040
saying.
Yeah.

3627
02:59:25,040 --> 02:59:28,910
I mean there's not a single thing we 
discussed today that wasn't 15 minutes 

3628
02:59:28,910 --> 02:59:31,020
long at least.
Right?

3629
02:59:31,320 --> 02:59:36,320
Yeah,
and you can't really condense that and 

3630
02:59:36,320 --> 02:59:37,851
mean you could condense it down,
but you lose a lot of the information 

3631
02:59:37,851 --> 02:59:39,090
and also you feel like you didn't do it 
justice.

3632
02:59:39,690 --> 02:59:44,690
Like I can't do those panel shows 
because I feel like there's no way I'm 

3633
02:59:44,690 --> 02:59:45,480
going to be able to do anything justice.

3634
02:59:45,480 --> 02:59:49,770
I just as not snow room.
Especially now when people play it up to

3635
02:59:49,800 --> 02:59:51,960
they know that they're there for the 
entertainment value,

3636
02:59:51,961 --> 02:59:54,280
so it's more about being upset at what 
someone's saying.

3637
02:59:54,390 --> 02:59:56,460
Some real under having some real 
understanding.

3638
02:59:56,590 --> 02:59:58,950
Right.
It's also about barking out your talking

3639
02:59:58,951 --> 03:00:03,951
points in this like ferocious a manner 
as you can so that it can appear that 

3640
03:00:03,951 --> 03:00:04,980
you're winning.
Yeah.

3641
03:00:05,740 --> 03:00:10,740
You're a nice guy too though.
You know you're not going to come and 

3642
03:00:10,740 --> 03:00:10,740
attack somebody.
I definitely don't want to do that.

3643
03:00:10,890 --> 03:00:13,930
The the what?
I have people on our.

3644
03:00:14,040 --> 03:00:16,710
Even someone that I think I'm going to 
disagree with,

3645
03:00:16,740 --> 03:00:20,060
I just want.
I wanted to see how they think I want.

3646
03:00:20,200 --> 03:00:22,620
Even some people get mad.
They go,

3647
03:00:22,621 --> 03:00:23,640
oh dude,
you know,

3648
03:00:23,641 --> 03:00:26,130
you more for your opinions based on 
whoever's on the show.

3649
03:00:26,131 --> 03:00:31,131
That's not what I do,
but what I do do is I let people talk 

3650
03:00:31,131 --> 03:00:34,950
and I try to see their point of view and
I try to expand their point of view.

3651
03:00:35,070 --> 03:00:36,710
So if they say something,
they're also.

3652
03:00:36,930 --> 03:00:40,530
So what it is is that this,
and I want them to keep going.

3653
03:00:40,750 --> 03:00:41,550
I want,
I want to.

3654
03:00:41,880 --> 03:00:44,940
I want to see the whole landscape or 
their thought process.

3655
03:00:44,941 --> 03:00:47,430
I don't want to want to see a tiny 
garden.

3656
03:00:47,820 --> 03:00:49,680
I don't want to see a little potted 
plant.

3657
03:00:49,890 --> 03:00:54,890
I want to see the whole thing.
I want to get a sense of why do I 

3658
03:00:54,890 --> 03:00:55,620
disagree with them?
What am I fucked up?

3659
03:00:55,650 --> 03:01:00,650
Maybe it's me.
Maybe it's maybe it's them should be 

3660
03:01:00,650 --> 03:01:00,650
too.
I

3661
03:01:00,650 --> 03:01:05,040
don't think people should be stuck in 
their opinion of even no matter how 

3662
03:01:05,040 --> 03:01:07,681
right you think you are,
I think you should always be open to 

3663
03:01:07,681 --> 03:01:07,681
changing your mind.

3664
03:01:07,681 --> 03:01:12,170
I think so too,
but I think that's one of the rarest 

3665
03:01:12,170 --> 03:01:14,960
qualities when it comes to discourse is 
the ability that people have to abandon 

3666
03:01:14,960 --> 03:01:18,160
ideas that they've supported in the past
because

3667
03:01:18,160 --> 03:01:23,160
what does that mean then?
If you're on one side and everyone in 

3668
03:01:23,160 --> 03:01:25,801
your life thinks this way,
what does it mean if you don't think 

3669
03:01:25,801 --> 03:01:25,801
that way?

3670
03:01:25,801 --> 03:01:25,801
Yeah.
Well,

3671
03:01:25,801 --> 03:01:26,790
what is.
What are the.

3672
03:01:26,791 --> 03:01:31,791
Are Are the ideas you or you,
you and the ideas are just things that 

3673
03:01:31,791 --> 03:01:33,210
you're.
You're examining.

3674
03:01:33,350 --> 03:01:34,770
Yeah,
that's what it should be,

3675
03:01:35,460 --> 03:01:36,810
but for most people,
including me,

3676
03:01:36,811 --> 03:01:38,880
most of my life,
that was not the case.

3677
03:01:38,910 --> 03:01:43,910
If I had an idea and I,
if I supported that idea that I'll 

3678
03:01:43,910 --> 03:01:44,100
fucking fight you.
This is this arm,

3679
03:01:44,101 --> 03:01:45,060
right,
and you're wrong,

3680
03:01:45,061 --> 03:01:49,320
and what change?
Then doing this,

3681
03:01:50,070 --> 03:01:53,070
doing this podcast changed the way I 
talk to people.

3682
03:01:53,130 --> 03:01:56,850
Change the way I look at life.
I've talked to so many smart people.

3683
03:01:57,300 --> 03:02:00,720
I mean,
I've had a thousand 100,

3684
03:02:02,370 --> 03:02:06,840
1200,
1200 podcasts plus all the mma ones.

3685
03:02:07,610 --> 03:02:10,140
Um,
there's so many conversations.

3686
03:02:10,470 --> 03:02:15,470
So in,
through those conversations I've gotten 

3687
03:02:15,470 --> 03:02:19,220
at least not a formal education,
but an understanding of things that I 

3688
03:02:19,220 --> 03:02:19,220
never had before

3689
03:02:19,590 --> 03:02:20,670
across a lot of subject.

3690
03:02:20,810 --> 03:02:22,180
Yeah.
Yeah.

3691
03:02:22,190 --> 03:02:27,190
And through that I think of understand,
I've come to understand not just how I 

3692
03:02:28,881 --> 03:02:31,400
think about things,
but why,

3693
03:02:31,670 --> 03:02:32,910
why,
uh,

3694
03:02:33,010 --> 03:02:38,010
I've had road blocks and conversations 
before and speed bumps and,

3695
03:02:38,300 --> 03:02:39,640
and I've learned,
you know,

3696
03:02:39,650 --> 03:02:43,550
I think if you examine your own yourself
and your own thoughts,

3697
03:02:43,950 --> 03:02:46,820
you're sure to learn hopefully.

3698
03:02:46,990 --> 03:02:49,780
Yeah.
And I think it also can help if you look

3699
03:02:49,781 --> 03:02:54,781
at the other side,
it can help you figure out why you 

3700
03:02:54,781 --> 03:02:55,630
believe what you believe too,
because you can look at them and say,

3701
03:02:55,960 --> 03:02:57,910
okay,
I still don't agree with you and this is

3702
03:02:57,911 --> 03:03:02,911
why I think if people aren't even 
willing to look at the other side and 

3703
03:03:02,911 --> 03:03:04,030
consider why they might be wrong,
how do you really know?

3704
03:03:04,280 --> 03:03:09,280
Yeah.
And then you also run into some people 

3705
03:03:09,280 --> 03:03:12,611
that they don't really have opinions.
They have these things that they've 

3706
03:03:12,921 --> 03:03:14,930
adopted,
like slogans.

3707
03:03:15,020 --> 03:03:15,770
Yeah,
they,

3708
03:03:15,830 --> 03:03:17,290
they've,
they've gotten these things,

3709
03:03:17,320 --> 03:03:19,670
they've decided this is what my side 
support,

3710
03:03:19,671 --> 03:03:24,671
so I'm going to just spout this out and 
this makes me seem like I'm a good team 

3711
03:03:24,671 --> 03:03:24,671
player.
And,

3712
03:03:24,671 --> 03:03:29,190
and then the thing about podcast though,
when you sit down for three hours,

3713
03:03:29,191 --> 03:03:30,650
you go,
why do you think that?

3714
03:03:30,970 --> 03:03:35,970
Like what's going on there?
And then they start talking about why 

3715
03:03:35,970 --> 03:03:38,891
they think that and then know it all 
falls apart and then you realize that 

3716
03:03:38,891 --> 03:03:39,650
they don't even know why they think 
that.

3717
03:03:39,720 --> 03:03:44,720
Yeah.
And they probably never even thought 

3718
03:03:44,720 --> 03:03:44,990
about it before they just been saying 
what they've been saying for so long.

3719
03:03:45,010 --> 03:03:46,160
Right.
Because it sounds nice.

3720
03:03:46,220 --> 03:03:47,150
Yeah.
Yeah.

3721
03:03:47,720 --> 03:03:49,370
People love to do that.
They love it.

3722
03:03:49,370 --> 03:03:51,830
It's a sport.
I mean there's idea sports,

3723
03:03:52,280 --> 03:03:53,030
you know,
an idea.

3724
03:03:53,031 --> 03:03:57,230
Sports or arguments,
arguments are so oftentimes idea sports.

3725
03:03:57,820 --> 03:03:59,500
Yeah.
Politics too.

3726
03:03:59,501 --> 03:04:01,010
To some degree I think.
Oh yeah,

3727
03:04:01,220 --> 03:04:04,670
for sure.
But the politics are just so flavored by

3728
03:04:04,671 --> 03:04:06,860
money.
The problem with that,

3729
03:04:07,230 --> 03:04:12,230
you know,
that version of idea sport is lobbyists 

3730
03:04:12,230 --> 03:04:13,640
and special interest groups and 
different people that are pushing you to

3731
03:04:13,641 --> 03:04:17,480
get in the office cause you're going to 
change laws and force things through and

3732
03:04:18,770 --> 03:04:22,250
that's the trickiest of all idea sports 
and also the most shallow.

3733
03:04:22,400 --> 03:04:27,400
I mean just think about presidential 
debates and speeches and those are the 

3734
03:04:27,400 --> 03:04:30,960
most shallow discussions in terms of the
actual reality of.

3735
03:04:31,300 --> 03:04:33,080
Yeah,
and who that person is.

3736
03:04:33,470 --> 03:04:38,470
Who is that person?
Imagine if you were dating someone and 

3737
03:04:38,470 --> 03:04:39,560
every time you went on a date with them 
it was like a presidential speech.

3738
03:04:40,870 --> 03:04:42,140
People like,
what the fuck are you?

3739
03:04:42,140 --> 03:04:45,110
I don't even know you are.
You don't display any humanity.

3740
03:04:45,111 --> 03:04:47,040
Kind of interesting though.
Yeah,

3741
03:04:47,060 --> 03:04:48,520
for sure.
Write a book about that.

3742
03:04:48,800 --> 03:04:51,200
But that's what we want in leaders,
right?

3743
03:04:51,201 --> 03:04:53,000
We want someone who's full of Shit,
who,

3744
03:04:53,060 --> 03:04:56,220
who like makes us feel better.
Like they.

3745
03:04:56,960 --> 03:04:59,090
Yeah.
That they're speaking like a leader.

3746
03:05:00,260 --> 03:05:02,030
You know?
It's weird.

3747
03:05:02,840 --> 03:05:05,360
It's weird that we liked these patterns.
So you know,

3748
03:05:05,361 --> 03:05:05,730
the,
the,

3749
03:05:05,780 --> 03:05:09,770
the presidential speaking pattern is of 
a very,

3750
03:05:09,771 --> 03:05:11,790
very strange one.
Yeah.

3751
03:05:12,710 --> 03:05:15,770
It's soothing though.
Yeah,

3752
03:05:16,280 --> 03:05:17,660
I guess in a way,
right?

3753
03:05:18,110 --> 03:05:20,960
Yeah.
In a way it's soothing because we want a

3754
03:05:20,961 --> 03:05:23,960
big daddy,
big daddy to take care of us,

3755
03:05:24,030 --> 03:05:25,670
you know,
tell us everything will be okay.

3756
03:05:25,730 --> 03:05:27,890
But as you get older that makes less and
less sense.

3757
03:05:28,220 --> 03:05:32,510
Like I'm 50 and so if a new president 
was 45,

3758
03:05:32,511 --> 03:05:34,220
I'd be like,
that bitch don't know shit.

3759
03:05:34,800 --> 03:05:37,940
He know have only been living in 45 
years.

3760
03:05:38,300 --> 03:05:39,560
Shit,
you know,

3761
03:05:39,561 --> 03:05:42,740
but like when you're 30 and the 
president's 70 like,

3762
03:05:42,741 --> 03:05:46,250
well you make sense he's an established 
person,

3763
03:05:46,280 --> 03:05:49,700
he's a man of reason.
But is it at the age difference or is it

3764
03:05:49,701 --> 03:05:51,320
your own maturity?
Well,

3765
03:05:51,321 --> 03:05:56,321
there's a lot of old dummies for sure.
There's a lot of dummies who just 

3766
03:05:56,321 --> 03:05:57,200
survived because we nerfed up the world 
for them.

3767
03:05:58,730 --> 03:06:00,110
Yeah,
it's your own maturity.

3768
03:06:00,260 --> 03:06:03,590
It's also the amount of time that you 
have to examine ideas.

3769
03:06:03,970 --> 03:06:05,510
See,
if I worked in a coal mine,

3770
03:06:05,540 --> 03:06:10,540
I probably would not have the time to 
sit around all day and think shit 

3771
03:06:10,540 --> 03:06:14,981
through.
There's a a great luxury that you have 

3772
03:06:14,981 --> 03:06:15,380
when you're,
when you do this for a living,

3773
03:06:15,890 --> 03:06:20,890
that you get a chance to communicate 
with people over and over and over 

3774
03:06:20,890 --> 03:06:22,100
again,
and there'll be another podcast.

3775
03:06:22,101 --> 03:06:27,101
Tomorrow's another podcast next day.
Every day I'm looking at a new person 

3776
03:06:27,101 --> 03:06:30,670
and talking to a new brain and trying to
see how it goes on in there.

3777
03:06:30,920 --> 03:06:35,920
What's behind the eyes figured out?
Is that why you like it this length?

3778
03:06:38,150 --> 03:06:40,340
You know what?
Everybody told me not to do this.

3779
03:06:40,400 --> 03:06:45,400
This is where the Arusha fear.
It's famously told me to go to your 

3780
03:06:45,400 --> 03:06:45,680
podcast.
I go,

3781
03:06:45,681 --> 03:06:50,681
why?
No one's going to listen to it for that 

3782
03:06:50,681 --> 03:06:50,681
long so they don't listen and don't give
a fuck.

3783
03:06:51,090 --> 03:06:53,270
Like I'm just going to do this.
He's like,

3784
03:06:53,280 --> 03:06:54,460
you should.
Or like,

3785
03:06:54,470 --> 03:06:55,140
why?
Well,

3786
03:06:55,141 --> 03:06:56,610
this parts that are not good.
I go,

3787
03:06:56,611 --> 03:07:01,611
yeah,
those parts you're going to have to 

3788
03:07:01,611 --> 03:07:01,611
either skip over or just not.
Not downloaded.

3789
03:07:01,611 --> 03:07:02,160
I don't give a shit.

3790
03:07:02,450 --> 03:07:04,460
The nice thing about long form though 
too,

3791
03:07:04,490 --> 03:07:07,190
if people know it's not edited,
they trusted a bit more.

3792
03:07:07,260 --> 03:07:09,330
Yes,
yes.

3793
03:07:09,660 --> 03:07:11,160
Yeah,
there's definitely that.

3794
03:07:11,550 --> 03:07:12,150
Yeah.
The,

3795
03:07:12,200 --> 03:07:12,780
the,
the,

3796
03:07:12,800 --> 03:07:14,300
the like that,
but the,

3797
03:07:14,310 --> 03:07:14,620
the,
the,

3798
03:07:14,630 --> 03:07:14,970
the,
the,

3799
03:07:14,971 --> 03:07:15,570
the,
yeah,

3800
03:07:15,600 --> 03:07:17,070
all that.
That's in there.

3801
03:07:18,300 --> 03:07:19,860
Character.
That's who you are.

3802
03:07:19,890 --> 03:07:24,890
That's who you are and you know,
there's no way you could free ball an 

3803
03:07:24,890 --> 03:07:26,430
entire three hours and will Sam Harris 
can do it.

3804
03:07:26,460 --> 03:07:27,990
He's pretty good at it.
Yeah.

3805
03:07:28,260 --> 03:07:31,590
Super articulate guy with practice while
you've been doing this a long time.

3806
03:07:31,591 --> 03:07:33,540
You're good.
Well thank you.

3807
03:07:33,780 --> 03:07:34,980
You're good at it too.
Thank you.

3808
03:07:35,490 --> 03:07:37,290
Um,
which did three hours.

3809
03:07:37,740 --> 03:07:39,950
Is there anything you would like to,
uh,

3810
03:07:40,830 --> 03:07:44,670
to say or Zany thing you didn't?
Don't think we covered.

3811
03:07:44,820 --> 03:07:49,820
Mm,
I guess the only thing I'd say we just 

3812
03:07:49,820 --> 03:07:49,820
launched our first season of wrong 
speak.

3813
03:07:49,820 --> 03:07:51,220
The second season will be starting in 
the fall.

3814
03:07:51,360 --> 03:07:56,360
Now.
How are you doing when you're saying 

3815
03:07:56,360 --> 03:07:57,571
seasons?
So we did three for the first and we're 

3816
03:07:57,571 --> 03:07:57,571
going to do another cluster of three or 
four for the next.

3817
03:07:57,571 --> 03:08:01,960
But why are you calling them a season?
Because it's one group and one 

3818
03:08:01,960 --> 03:08:02,690
particular subjects.

3819
03:08:02,750 --> 03:08:03,500
No.
So then,

3820
03:08:03,590 --> 03:08:07,220
so next season we're going to do one on 
political correctness.

3821
03:08:07,221 --> 03:08:12,221
In comedy.
There's going to be one on academic 

3822
03:08:12,221 --> 03:08:13,961
mobbing and then there's gonna be 
another one that's going to be 

3823
03:08:13,961 --> 03:08:13,961
surprised.

3824
03:08:13,961 --> 03:08:14,430
Oh,
so you plan them out way in advance?

3825
03:08:14,460 --> 03:08:15,020
Yeah.

3826
03:08:15,380 --> 03:08:17,970
Well we do a bit more of a.
it's kind of more of a structure,

3827
03:08:17,971 --> 03:08:20,280
like a story.
It's not a long form

3828
03:08:20,490 --> 03:08:24,810
thing.
It's more of a more production in there.

3829
03:08:24,930 --> 03:08:27,720
I've mostly heard you do other people's 
stuff.

3830
03:08:28,140 --> 03:08:29,790
Yeah,
probably.

3831
03:08:29,850 --> 03:08:31,070
So you're doing a lot of.
How did you.

3832
03:08:31,100 --> 03:08:32,800
How did you do a lot?
Well,

3833
03:08:32,801 --> 03:08:35,520
I'm not sure how I found out about you,
man.

3834
03:08:35,550 --> 03:08:39,300
I'm sure I found out about you online,
but I don't know what it was that,

3835
03:08:39,510 --> 03:08:41,790
that led me to one of your interviews.

3836
03:08:41,860 --> 03:08:46,860
Probably the Google memo.
I think when I wrote that column 

3837
03:08:46,860 --> 03:08:49,000
defending Jameson Moore's memo because I
think that's when we first started being

3838
03:08:49,001 --> 03:08:50,950
in contact.
Yeah.

3839
03:08:51,070 --> 03:08:52,390
Yeah.
But yeah,

3840
03:08:52,391 --> 03:08:57,391
I do a lot of stuff.
I'd so I have a week of convert 

3841
03:08:57,391 --> 03:08:58,870
playboy.com
monthly column for the Globe and Mail,

3842
03:08:58,871 --> 03:09:02,010
which is Canada's national newspaper 
cohost on wrong speak,

3843
03:09:02,080 --> 03:09:07,080
the podcast and I'll be doing hopefully 
lots and lots of more stuff going 

3844
03:09:07,080 --> 03:09:07,570
forward and hopefully we'll do this 
again.

3845
03:09:07,630 --> 03:09:09,520
I hope so.
This has been so much fun.

3846
03:09:09,580 --> 03:09:14,580
I'm totally fangirl now until you have 
been watching you as an mma color 

3847
03:09:14,580 --> 03:09:15,520
commentator forever.
So this has been so cool.

3848
03:09:15,780 --> 03:09:17,100
Well,
I thought it was really cool too.

3849
03:09:17,101 --> 03:09:22,101
I really enjoyed talking to tell people 
how they can find your social media and 

3850
03:09:22,101 --> 03:09:22,101
all that jazz.

3851
03:09:22,150 --> 03:09:23,500
Uh,
I met Dr Deborah,

3852
03:09:23,501 --> 03:09:26,680
so on twitter and facebook,
Dr Deborah W,

3853
03:09:26,681 --> 03:09:28,960
so on instagram and then you can check 
out wrong,

3854
03:09:28,961 --> 03:09:32,650
speak at wrong speak and all major 
podcasting platforms,

3855
03:09:32,651 --> 03:09:34,670
itunes play.
We did a deborah.

3856
03:09:35,350 --> 03:09:36,790
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

3857
03:09:36,910 --> 03:09:37,450
Bye everybody.

3858
03:09:46,820 --> 03:09:47,200
Mm.
