1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,620
I don't even think they're nuclear bombs
work.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,280
It's all posturing probably,
right?

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:06,330
Yeah.
Do Do,

4
00:00:06,331 --> 00:00:10,080
do Abby Martin were like,
wow,

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,710
you have a doom shirt on.
Powerful street cred with the kids.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,550
They're going back to the Wolfenstein 
doom days.

7
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:20,090
Old School id software.
Hell,

8
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,780
he had that game.
That game was awesome.

9
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,990
I missed him or due to the new ones are 
pretty bad movie.

10
00:00:24,991 --> 00:00:26,100
I never saw it.
I did.

11
00:00:26,101 --> 00:00:29,370
It was terrible.
Was it the first person shooters so bad?

12
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:30,090
No,
no,

13
00:00:30,091 --> 00:00:30,630
no.
There was a.

14
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,840
There was a first person shooter movie 
like something Harry or something like 

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,650
that.
Hardcore hardcore.

16
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:39,480
Henry.
Henry and Henry.

17
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,680
Was it good?
That was nuts.

18
00:00:40,681 --> 00:00:42,960
It really just felt like you're watching
a video game the whole time.

19
00:00:42,961 --> 00:00:44,550
It was absolutely insane.
What was it?

20
00:00:44,551 --> 00:00:49,551
Good.
I don't know if it was just very 

21
00:00:49,551 --> 00:00:50,230
entertaining.
Well,

22
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:51,870
there is.
Yeah,

23
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:54,350
that's right.
The Rock.

24
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,760
When he had hair.
Wow.

25
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:59,100
That's right.
Old School guy.

26
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:02,930
That was a terrible movie was so dumb.
Why does it look like that?

27
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:05,940
I remember doing being super red and 
orange and this is blue.

28
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:06,840
Come on.
Come on.

29
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,420
Who the hell's going on?
Why is he listed first?

30
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,330
Because nobody knew who the raclette 
Karl Urban.

31
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,850
Exactly.
That's how old that movie was.

32
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,090
What else is Karl?
Urban Bennon Dude,

33
00:01:18,091 --> 00:01:20,430
I just had a twitter argument with 
Chelsea Clinton.

34
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:27,480
It's like these people don't understand,
never respond to someone who's like way 

35
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:27,480
less than a year,
you know,

36
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:27,710
she like,
she,

37
00:01:27,711 --> 00:01:28,350
like,
I called her,

38
00:01:28,351 --> 00:01:33,351
I basically,
I called her parents were criminals and 

39
00:01:33,351 --> 00:01:33,351
she was like,
yeah,

40
00:01:33,351 --> 00:01:35,190
you know,
I should have listened more during,

41
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,820
during the 2003 Iraq war today,
antiwar activist.

42
00:01:38,821 --> 00:01:43,821
But she initially called people who were
protesting the Afghanistan war and like 

43
00:01:43,821 --> 00:01:46,260
the AUMF anti American.
So she was like,

44
00:01:46,261 --> 00:01:51,261
yeah,
because there was a story that came out 

45
00:01:51,261 --> 00:01:52,440
that said Chelsea Clinton actually with 
like American flags and all these things

46
00:01:52,441 --> 00:01:57,390
like went and disrupted an antiwar 
protest after nine slash 11.

47
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:01,230
Yeah,
like a group of Patriots and in probably

48
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,940
22 or something.
I mean maybe,

49
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:09,980
maybe younger.
So then people were calling her out and 

50
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:09,980
being like,
you know,

51
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:10,110
like mother,
like daughter,

52
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:11,670
because there's stories of Hillary 
Clinton,

53
00:02:11,671 --> 00:02:14,340
like really working hard to quell the 
protest,

54
00:02:14,341 --> 00:02:16,770
the Vietnam war protests on,
on campus and stuff.

55
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:20,430
As the president of the Republican Young
Republicans Club.

56
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:25,460
She was the president really just pre or
post Kent state this.

57
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,150
Ooh,
good question.

58
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:32,630
Really good question.
I don't know it was when the whole that 

59
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:35,130
it'd be hard to defend it after that.
Right after people are shot.

60
00:02:35,131 --> 00:02:36,870
But yeah.
So Chelsea actually responded to me.

61
00:02:36,871 --> 00:02:40,020
I was floored because I was like,
your dad killed 500,000

62
00:02:40,021 --> 00:02:43,530
babies in Iraq with the sanctions and 
your mom voted for the Iraq war.

63
00:02:43,531 --> 00:02:45,510
I was like,
why don't you protest them?

64
00:02:45,511 --> 00:02:46,560
And she was like,
you know,

65
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:50,310
it was like what she just said.
She was like,

66
00:02:50,311 --> 00:02:51,150
you know,
I wasn't really.

67
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,700
She was,
I don't think that people protesting the

68
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,500
Afghanistan war,
anti American.

69
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:55,480
She was like,
you know,

70
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,080
140 characters limiting.
I was like,

71
00:02:58,081 --> 00:03:03,081
do you see that?
I just called your parents were 

72
00:03:03,081 --> 00:03:03,081
criminals

73
00:03:03,081 --> 00:03:04,740
and you're actually responding whatever,
whatever WTF.

74
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,670
Just put the blinders on.
Oh my God.

75
00:03:06,671 --> 00:03:11,671
And then she was like,
I was talking about the Americans who 

76
00:03:11,671 --> 00:03:13,651
denounce,
like you know that America is an 

77
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:13,651
imperialist warmonger.
I was like,

78
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:17,910
it is the countries in an imperialist 
war mongering country that's killed 

79
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:22,020
millions of people use cert,
the democratic processes of dozens of 

80
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,710
countries and the world actually thinks 
that America is the number one threat to

81
00:03:23,711 --> 00:03:26,350
global peace.
So I actually agree with the Americans.

82
00:03:26,351 --> 00:03:28,510
You denounce Chelsea.
It was nuts.

83
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,270
So that was a highlight of the day.
Yeah,

84
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,190
that's not a good look for her.
No,

85
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,230
she should probably stay off twitter for
a few years.

86
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:36,240
It's like,
dude,

87
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:37,630
just just step back.
I mean,

88
00:03:37,631 --> 00:03:42,631
you sound awful.
I know that you're trying to get in the 

89
00:03:42,631 --> 00:03:42,631
public spotlight in and get that 
momentum behind you.

90
00:03:42,631 --> 00:03:46,921
I mean,
people are already talking about her 

91
00:03:46,921 --> 00:03:47,450
running in 20 slash 20 Michelle Obama,
Chelsea Clinton together.

92
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,360
The two of them together that Jay.
Can you imagine?

93
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:55,450
Whoa.
That would be hilarious.

94
00:03:55,690 --> 00:04:00,690
What's the problem is as soon as you 
engage with someone that's calling 

95
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:03,670
anyone who is absolutely responsible for
death,

96
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:06,370
a war criminal,
as soon as you engage,

97
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:06,940
it's like,
well,

98
00:04:06,941 --> 00:04:09,460
then you have to define what do you 
think is a war criminal?

99
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:12,010
Like what's okay for you?
Is it okay if 10,000

100
00:04:12,011 --> 00:04:13,070
babies?
Now he said,

101
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:17,230
I mean like you could kind of call any 
president ever a war criminal except for

102
00:04:17,231 --> 00:04:22,231
maybe Jimmy Carter.
Jimmy Carter gets slippery because he 

103
00:04:22,231 --> 00:04:25,681
was really a peaceful man and a really 
weird situation and I think a lot of 

104
00:04:25,681 --> 00:04:28,120
people capitalized on that weakness,
including Ronald Reagan,

105
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:33,330
which is the reason why the hostages in 
Iran weren't even released until after 

106
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:35,950
Reagan took office and nuts.
That's a crazy story.

107
00:04:35,951 --> 00:04:39,790
It's a crazy story because they 
literally kept those people prisoner and

108
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:44,791
negotiated with their release based on 
Ronald Reagan winning the election to 

109
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:44,791
make them look better.

110
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:47,560
Those people were prisoner longer 
because of Reagan,

111
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,830
like they could have just gotten them 
out in a total,

112
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,750
nonpartisan way.
They could've said,

113
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:53,770
hey,
these are Americans.

114
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:56,110
Let's get them home like fuck out of 
there.

115
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,090
They wanted to move those chips around 
the board.

116
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,310
Let's move this,
let's move these pieces.

117
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:06,060
It was,
it was almost as good a that Chelsea 

118
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,460
Clinton recognition as when John Mccain 
tweeted a segment that I did about him 

119
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:12,841
on breaking the set,
which was like the most scathing 

120
00:05:12,841 --> 00:05:13,300
segment,
calling him as senile crazy war criminal

121
00:05:13,301 --> 00:05:18,301
like sadistic fuck.
And he like tweeted it out and he was 

122
00:05:18,301 --> 00:05:18,301
like,
thanks Vlad.

123
00:05:18,301 --> 00:05:22,770
Vladimir Vladimir Putin.
If lad continues his attacks against me 

124
00:05:23,861 --> 00:05:26,220
and tweeted out to like is,
that's really what he said.

125
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,090
Yeah.
Now you don't.

126
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:30,640
You didn't have anybody telling you what
to do.

127
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,970
No,
but God can.

128
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:38,980
You heard about all the DNI report,
that intelligence report that basically 

129
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:42,661
claimed that I,
along with another show cost Hillary 

130
00:05:42,661 --> 00:05:43,360
Clinton the election.
I mean this intelligence report came out

131
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:48,750
after months and months.
Everyone's waiting with baited breath 

132
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:48,750
thinking,
okay,

133
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,110
we're finally going to get evidence that
Russia hacked the election,

134
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:55,380
right?
This claim that Russia hacked the 

135
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:55,380
election and then they come out with 
this report.

136
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,030
Half of it was just bashing our tea and 
it named my shows

137
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:01,280
specifically,
and it said the show covered fracking,

138
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,740
occupy Wall Street,
um,

139
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:06,830
government greed,
Hillary Clinton's war crimes.

140
00:06:06,831 --> 00:06:11,831
It's like,
and they basically just insinuated that 

141
00:06:11,831 --> 00:06:12,590
these things are what cost Hillary 
Clinton the election,

142
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,810
a show that had gone off the air two 
years before.

143
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:20,700
It's nuts,
but people are terrified of ridiculous 

144
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:21,350
shit.
The intelligence community,

145
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:27,130
how do they do that?
Then how could they do that if you're 

146
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:27,290
showing off the year,
two years before the previous criticism?

147
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:29,840
Yeah.
They said that that was when like Russia

148
00:06:29,841 --> 00:06:34,580
had begun to foment like all this 
descent and um,

149
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,280
and trying to discredit American 
democracy.

150
00:06:37,281 --> 00:06:42,281
Like that's when Russia really like 
began the propaganda campaign was when 

151
00:06:42,281 --> 00:06:42,740
my show,
I was like the vector.

152
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:48,250
I was like this,
this person that was put in there and 

153
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,940
started to unravel democracy.
It's crazy.

154
00:06:49,941 --> 00:06:53,240
It's an enormous amount of power,
but you didn't know yet.

155
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,400
But what's even crazier about it is it's
like,

156
00:06:55,401 --> 00:06:57,890
yeah,
of course our t is pro Russian.

157
00:06:57,891 --> 00:07:02,891
It's fucking called Russia today.
Of course they're going to cover Putin 

158
00:07:02,891 --> 00:07:03,290
in a positive light.
The crazy thing is that the intelligence

159
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:08,291
report essentially said that covering 
real issues like covering greed and 

160
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:12,550
fracking are our Russian propaganda 
talking points and that was really bad 

161
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:16,121
because you're.
You're calling reality propaganda like 

162
00:07:16,121 --> 00:07:16,121
people are living in poverty in this 
country,

163
00:07:16,121 --> 00:07:18,320
half the countries and poor living 
paycheck to paycheck,

164
00:07:18,321 --> 00:07:21,590
so you can't call like covering that 
reality propaganda.

165
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:24,440
Russian propaganda.
That's fucking reality is slippery.

166
00:07:24,441 --> 00:07:29,441
They're working for something like Rt.
If they are going to view poutine in a 

167
00:07:29,441 --> 00:07:32,590
positive light but they are going to 
criticize clinton like it is.

168
00:07:32,591 --> 00:07:35,000
He does get a lIttle slip.
Are you happy you're not there anymore?

169
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,990
I am happy that I'm doing the reporting 
that I'm doing or just like more just on

170
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:40,460
the ground investigation.

171
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,430
Like since I last saw you,
I've been to palestine.

172
00:07:43,431 --> 00:07:48,431
Like now I finally like really have a 
sense of these issues that I was 

173
00:07:48,431 --> 00:07:49,220
covering from the studio and and feel 
like I know them more,

174
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,200
you know,
after going and talking to the people in

175
00:07:51,201 --> 00:07:52,510
the communities and stuff like that.
So the,

176
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,920
the journalism is definitely much 
better.

177
00:07:54,921 --> 00:07:57,560
I don't have any boss,
I'm just doing my own things.

178
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:59,120
And you totally didn't know.
Well,

179
00:07:59,121 --> 00:08:04,121
I'm working for telos sore.
So it's like a latin american state 

180
00:08:04,121 --> 00:08:04,121
funded media.
Now,

181
00:08:04,121 --> 00:08:08,230
just to close to soros,
he's the one that makes the weed 

182
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,180
stronger.
Did you read that?

183
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:14,580
Controls everything.
I chose the same as he's making the weed

184
00:08:14,581 --> 00:08:16,130
stronger.
Can I ask you a question?

185
00:08:16,131 --> 00:08:19,010
What one does a billionaire become a 
globalist?

186
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,100
Because why is not?
Why is rex tillerson not a globalist,

187
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:27,930
the exxon mobil ceo?
Like one question that this whole thing 

188
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:32,681
about like soros is this globalist and 
all these people are against the 

189
00:08:32,681 --> 00:08:35,471
globalist yet trump,
it's totally fine to have rex tillerson 

190
00:08:35,471 --> 00:08:39,011
and all these goldman sachs bankers and 
the government and why are they not 

191
00:08:39,011 --> 00:08:40,430
globalists capital move across the left 
wing.

192
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:44,870
Democrats with money are globalists.
What does that mean?

193
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,600
Trump's in power.
So that's how it works.

194
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:50,120
So if trump wasn't in power,
then it would be rupert murdoch.

195
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,400
So it'd be the one.
He'd be the evil bandit.

196
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,980
It's nuts.
It's nuts.

197
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:55,470
I mean,
yes.

198
00:08:55,471 --> 00:08:56,010
Soros is

199
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:59,190
a horrible person who's done a ton of 
crazy shit,

200
00:08:59,191 --> 00:09:02,940
but like so as rex tillerson,
so are all these people,

201
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:05,670
you know,
betsy devoss is his psychotic.

202
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
These people are christian 
fundamentalists who have used trump as 

203
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,781
like the trojan horse to get into power.
These people have been vying for power 

204
00:09:14,781 --> 00:09:14,970
for the last 30 years.
These christian evangelicals,

205
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,170
mike pence,
betsy devoss,

206
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:17,820
you know betsy devoss,
his brothers.

207
00:09:17,821 --> 00:09:18,710
Eric prince,
right?

208
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,180
The blackwater guy.
Yeah.

209
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,290
That's her brother.
That's her brother.

210
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:25,140
Who is a divorce.
Her married name?

211
00:09:25,141 --> 00:09:28,050
Yeah.
What is her deal again?

212
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,030
So she,
her and her,

213
00:09:30,031 --> 00:09:33,260
I think her husband's names dick,
but um,

214
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:38,330
she married into this like education 
privatization scheme where it's like a 

215
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:43,060
super right wing religious extremist 
education privatization thing where 

216
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:47,601
they're trying to like get vouchers for 
creationism and all these things like 

217
00:09:47,601 --> 00:09:49,530
private schooling that teaches 
creationism.

218
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,680
And so they funneled the betsy devoss 
like family.

219
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,380
Um,
I forget what the organization's called,

220
00:09:55,381 --> 00:09:58,590
but they've funneled millions and 
millions of dollars into this sCam.

221
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,470
I'm meanwhile her brother,
Eric Prince.

222
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,520
You know what he's been doing.
I mean,

223
00:10:02,521 --> 00:10:04,770
he's now working for like Qatar,
Saudi Arabia,

224
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,720
I think it's United Arab Emirates and I 
think he literally,

225
00:10:09,721 --> 00:10:14,721
when arab spring broke out,
he took his whole business over there 

226
00:10:14,721 --> 00:10:15,510
was like,
listen,

227
00:10:15,511 --> 00:10:20,511
there's a way to prevent those war.
So tHey have like a private militant 

228
00:10:22,501 --> 00:10:27,501
group over there or rather a mercenary 
group over there that's kind of running 

229
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:27,570
their,
their army.

230
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:32,580
It's so crazy.
It's like this family is working 

231
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,981
together to create these like obedient 
christianized soldier children who are 

232
00:10:35,171 --> 00:10:37,510
growing up in schools thinking that,
you know,

233
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,970
the kingdom and the messiah gonna come.
I mean it's nuts.

234
00:10:39,971 --> 00:10:40,340
And,
and,

235
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:42,760
and when she was in the confirmation 
hearing,

236
00:10:42,761 --> 00:10:47,761
of course she was the only one that 
actually wasn't confirmed in mike pence 

237
00:10:47,761 --> 00:10:47,761
had to do the tiebreaker because 
everyone was like,

238
00:10:47,761 --> 00:10:49,930
she's the most unqualified person.
She cAn't spell.

239
00:10:49,931 --> 00:10:52,190
She's like a total moron.
I'm,

240
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:54,790
why is she even like in the running 
here?

241
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,710
And she lied multiple times in the 
hearing.

242
00:10:56,711 --> 00:10:57,370
She was like,
yeah,

243
00:10:57,371 --> 00:11:02,371
no,
that was a clerical error when it said 

244
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:02,560
that I was vice president or on the 
board of this organization,

245
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:07,561
which is this right wing extremist hate 
mongering organization that's funneled 

246
00:11:07,561 --> 00:11:12,121
millions of dollars to knock down all 
the the gay marriage propositions and 

247
00:11:12,121 --> 00:11:15,691
all these states and stuff like that.
So she lied and said she wasn't on the 

248
00:11:15,691 --> 00:11:18,661
board,
but really when you look at the 

249
00:11:18,661 --> 00:11:20,101
paperwork,
she was on the board for like 10 years 

250
00:11:20,101 --> 00:11:20,101
or something.
I mean,

251
00:11:20,101 --> 00:11:20,260
how could a clerical error happened?
Not that long.

252
00:11:20,261 --> 00:11:22,570
So it's sick.
These people are sick.

253
00:11:22,571 --> 00:11:27,571
Mike pence is a disgusting person who he
fought for conversion therapy for gay 

254
00:11:27,571 --> 00:11:27,571
people.

255
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:29,710
Those people are on.
What does this say?

256
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,180
Refused to agree with democrat,
that schools are no place for guns,

257
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:39,420
citing one school that needs one to 
protect she grizzly grizzlies bears.

258
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:43,450
She really said this.
First of all,

259
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:49,110
grizzly bears are rarely predatory 
towards people and especially not in 

260
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:53,230
schools that don't go to school.
All.

261
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:57,580
I don't think that's ever happened.
Bedside and you know what you could do,

262
00:11:57,581 --> 00:12:02,581
you could just shut the door and then 
the kids cannot get in the school and 

263
00:12:02,581 --> 00:12:03,720
won't try.
Unbelievable.

264
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:08,250
The kids guns that didn't.
Someone say like the.

265
00:12:08,251 --> 00:12:10,450
The solution is sandy hook is giving the
children.

266
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:14,020
The teachers don't think that it would 
work either.

267
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:19,200
I mean it wouldn't be the worst idea to 
have some military presence in a place 

268
00:12:19,421 --> 00:12:21,910
that where people you really feel that 
they're threatened,

269
00:12:21,911 --> 00:12:24,100
but the question is like,
why are they threatened?

270
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:27,790
LIke you have a fucking mentally ill 
person who has access to guns.

271
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:32,530
The real issue is keeping track of 
mentally ill people I would imagine,

272
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:37,620
and also down that mentally ill thing.
Like wasn't that a vettIng thing that I 

273
00:12:37,871 --> 00:12:40,020
think the nra actually shut down that 
we.

274
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,240
That mentally ill people can actually 
still purchase firearms.

275
00:12:43,241 --> 00:12:45,040
Am I wrong about that?
That's a good question.

276
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:50,340
I think in terms of like what is the 
medication they're on because finds 

277
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:50,340
mental illness.
Yeah.

278
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:55,080
Well the federal government was trying 
to deny licenses to people that have 

279
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,730
marijuana,
medical marijuana prescriptions.

280
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,850
They were trying to deny them handgun 
licenses.

281
00:13:00,851 --> 00:13:03,430
Who were firearms license.
Hilarious.

282
00:13:03,431 --> 00:13:08,431
It's crazy because you could be on 
oxycontIn and all sorts of 

283
00:13:08,431 --> 00:13:11,410
disassociative drugs,
ssri which are almost entirely connected

284
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:14,740
to school shootings and mass shootings.
If you look at mass shootings,

285
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:20,100
the vast majority of them either were on
psych meds or have been on psych meds,

286
00:13:20,311 --> 00:13:22,930
were off psych meds and of course then 
the argument,

287
00:13:22,931 --> 00:13:27,931
the real scientific argument is that 
they had not necessarily the cause,

288
00:13:28,931 --> 00:13:33,931
you know,
the causation and correlation are not 

289
00:13:33,931 --> 00:13:33,931
necessarily connected.

290
00:13:33,931 --> 00:13:35,950
So no one knows exactly why those people
do that.

291
00:13:35,951 --> 00:13:39,340
But if you've ever talked to someone who
was on zoloft or anything,

292
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:44,910
one of the problems is there's a 
disassociation with reality and the that

293
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:49,920
nothing bothers you anymore.
Like I had a friend who was on it and 

294
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:49,920
she was telling me,
she's like,

295
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,150
I could come home and my house could be 
on fire and I'd be like,

296
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,680
oh,
my house is on fire.

297
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:58,300
She's like the dog burning.
She wanted to write a book called.

298
00:13:58,301 --> 00:14:03,301
I lost a year of my life because she,
she literally like nothing mattered.

299
00:14:04,481 --> 00:14:09,481
Everything was gray and black and white 
and there was no color and it was just 

300
00:14:09,851 --> 00:14:11,030
weird.
She was like,

301
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:16,110
my whole life just happened in a year,
and then I got off of them and then I 

302
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:16,150
was like,
oh,

303
00:14:16,151 --> 00:14:17,440
okay.
Now I'm a person again.

304
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,580
Like,
what the fuck happened to me for a year?

305
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:22,570
That's horrible.
Here's the shit out of me.

306
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:27,960
How many people they just throw on those
goddamn things and I know that some 

307
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,200
people are,
that they benefit from them.

308
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,930
I've had friends that have benefit from 
them.

309
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,530
I know there's a positive,
but I,

310
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:37,800
I gotta think there's too many people 
that are going right to them and not 

311
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,650
exercising,
not changing their diet,

312
00:14:38,651 --> 00:14:43,651
not trying to meditate,
not trying to seek some sort of a 

313
00:14:43,651 --> 00:14:47,071
positive avenue for their,
their life and their energy and see if 

314
00:14:47,741 --> 00:14:50,620
that has any effect on their depression.
It just scares the shit out of me.

315
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:51,890
Yeah.
Yeah.

316
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:52,460
No,
it's crazy.

317
00:14:52,461 --> 00:14:53,960
I mean,
how crazy is this jeff?

318
00:14:53,961 --> 00:14:56,390
Sessions like taking us back to regional
madness.

319
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:58,680
He wants to just say no again.
He wants to,

320
00:14:58,681 --> 00:15:00,070
he wants to restart.
Just say,

321
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:05,360
no,
this guy's nuts.

322
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:08,030
He's oLd as fuck.
That's a part of the problem.

323
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,640
And along with that guy,
dick and he.

324
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,740
Any guys still named dick?
What's her name?

325
00:15:12,741 --> 00:15:13,880
Just husband.
Oh yeah.

326
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,340
DIck device.
If you're sold that,

327
00:15:16,341 --> 00:15:18,830
your fucking parents called you dick 
silver.

328
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,880
Yeah.
the last dick that I know his dick 

329
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:23,880
tracy,
which is like,

330
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:23,880
you know an old nicole.
Yeah.

331
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:28,610
You're so old that the name dick wasn't 
referred to.

332
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,490
It wasn't a dick back then.
Right?

333
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:35,860
That's a fucking old.
You are so crazy that it's time to not 

334
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:36,950
be in charge of drug policy.
There's no way you're thinking clear.

335
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,200
There's no way he said it.
He said no.

336
00:15:39,201 --> 00:15:42,350
Good people smoke weed.
No good people smoke marijuana.

337
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,670
That's just not true,
jeff.

338
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:44,840
Yeah.
That's not true.

339
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,370
We're good people.
I'm a nice person.

340
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:48,440
Were very good and pay my taxes.
You fuck?

341
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:53,530
Yeah.
What else did I just read that just 

342
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:54,530
they're racist origins of making weed 
illegal obviously tweeted something like

343
00:15:54,531 --> 00:15:57,410
that a couPle of days ago about the 
racist origins.

344
00:15:57,410 --> 00:15:59,840
It was a rolling stone piece and the 
racist origins with the drug.

345
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:03,380
It was entireLy designed during the 
nixon administration.

346
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:08,520
This,
the whole schedule one designation for 

347
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,100
marijuana,
cocaine or cocaine,

348
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:11,060
cocaine has medical use,
believe it or not,

349
00:16:11,061 --> 00:16:13,040
scheduled to,
but marijuana,

350
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:14,960
mushrooms,
all these different psychedelic drugs.

351
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,340
I believe.
So.

352
00:16:16,341 --> 00:16:19,880
I'm pretty sure bizarre medical use of 
cocaine.

353
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:25,350
Um,
I think heroin as well check that jamie 

354
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:27,020
just in case.
But there is a medical use for cocaine.

355
00:16:27,021 --> 00:16:30,770
There's a medical use for heroin,
opiates,

356
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:35,890
things along those lines.
So I think they have different 

357
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:38,021
designations because of that because 
they still refuse to admit there's a 

358
00:16:38,021 --> 00:16:41,471
medical use for marijuana despite all 
the millions of people using it for 

359
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:44,030
positive,
including kids wIth epilepsy.

360
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:49,390
I mean it's a believable in autism.
I have a good friend who has a kid that 

361
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:54,281
had severe seizures and there was 
nothing they could do about it until 

362
00:16:54,281 --> 00:16:54,281
they started giving him.

363
00:16:54,281 --> 00:16:56,240
They would give him hash in like a piece
of melon,

364
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:57,390
you know,
like,

365
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:02,660
and all the sudden gone like all 
seizures and he's more communicative.

366
00:17:02,661 --> 00:17:07,550
He's more responsive.
He's got pretty severe cognitive issues.

367
00:17:07,551 --> 00:17:10,940
Autism and uh,
and also the seizures.

368
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,140
It's like,
it's pretty severe.

369
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:14,390
And the only thing that helps them as 
medical marijuana.

370
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,290
Yeah.
Yeah.

371
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:16,970
For me,
I just get high.

372
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:19,670
I just don't be clear folks.
I mean,

373
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:20,900
don't be confused.
I mean I,

374
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:22,880
I'm,
I'm pro all those things.

375
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:28,250
Yeah.
It was basically a knee operation was 

376
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:28,250
okay back in the day if you were making 
money.

377
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:31,550
So if there was businesses behind it,
cocaine's stunning.

378
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:37,930
It's used as a local anesthetic.
I never let the dentist dude fentanyl 

379
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:43,190
that shit prints at scheduled to,
oh my god,

380
00:17:43,191 --> 00:17:48,191
morphine scheduled to opm scheduled to 
cody and scheduled to I believe a meth 

381
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,670
schedule to.
Yeah.

382
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:52,820
And how um,
oh,

383
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:58,190
in that article it said that the south 
past all of these anti cocaine laws 

384
00:17:58,190 --> 00:17:59,550
because after the race riots and then 
they were like scared.

385
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:04,551
And then in san francisco they pass an 
opium ordinance targeting chinese 

386
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:08,301
people.
So it was like kind of racially bent 

387
00:18:08,301 --> 00:18:08,301
back in the day.
But of course we'd was never an Industry

388
00:18:08,301 --> 00:18:09,330
behind it.
So they just,

389
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:14,220
you know,
didn't have the capitalized fuck man.

390
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:17,490
Jeff sessions is a little little elf.
Why is he,

391
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:22,690
it's so bizarre.
He's was just like this old man who's 

392
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:22,690
totally out of touch and for some reason
he's just.

393
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,800
What are they going to do though?
Because California just legalized weed.

394
00:18:25,801 --> 00:18:30,801
I mean,
how are they going to continue with dea 

395
00:18:30,801 --> 00:18:30,801
raids and stuff?
Yeah,

396
00:18:30,801 --> 00:18:34,300
I think no,
but they are doing a bunch of sneaky 

397
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,761
shit like Washington dc as a 
disproportionate number of arrests on 

398
00:18:36,951 --> 00:18:41,951
people of color for marijuana.
They're getting arrested even though 

399
00:18:41,951 --> 00:18:43,880
Washington dc has legal recreational 
marijuana,

400
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,820
there was still arresting black people.
It's fucked up.

401
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,040
It's really weird.
There was a whole article on it.

402
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,960
They can't really.
They're arresting them,

403
00:18:50,961 --> 00:18:54,010
but they can't really do anything,
so they just arresting them there.

404
00:18:54,011 --> 00:18:59,011
They just go through the system.
They get processed and I mean I don't 

405
00:18:59,011 --> 00:19:02,740
think they're getting jay.
They're obviously getting jailed 

406
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:02,740
initially or at least brought in for to 
be booked,

407
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:08,140
but it's just the idea that this is 
still going on despite all the evidence.

408
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:11,180
It just shows you what a corrupt system.
Totally.

409
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:16,160
And americans just totally want legal,
recreational marijuana.

410
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:18,260
Well that's the only thing holding that 
sessions got back.

411
00:19:18,261 --> 00:19:23,240
Is it 57 percent of americans support,
legalized recreational marijuana,

412
00:19:23,241 --> 00:19:26,030
which is just unprecedented this,
it's never been that high before.

413
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,280
And that's people willing to answer 
polls.

414
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:33,580
I would venture that if you really got 
down and dirty with a bunch of people 

415
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:33,830
like you and I that aren't answering 
polls,

416
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:37,250
I bet you're going way over 70 percent 
because it just doesn't make any sense.

417
00:19:37,251 --> 00:19:39,170
And when dc passed the law,
um,

418
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,630
it was overwhelming and that's where all
the legislators are.

419
00:19:41,631 --> 00:19:46,631
Like obviously they want it to.
So what the hell is holding his back 

420
00:19:46,631 --> 00:19:46,631
here?
You guys are in dc,

421
00:19:46,631 --> 00:19:49,820
you all smoke weed is a massive,
massive amount of money that still being

422
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:54,821
spent by really odd groups like prison 
guard lobbies,

423
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,770
which is really crazy.
Then we use unions.

424
00:19:57,771 --> 00:20:02,771
Yeah.
They want more people in jail so they 

425
00:20:02,771 --> 00:20:04,310
can make more money and get more hours.
It's so crazy.

426
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:07,700
It is like vampires shit because you 
think about what you're doing.

427
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:11,600
You're literally trying to suck money 
out of people's lives.

428
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:13,610
I mean,
they don't look at it that way.

429
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:18,790
They're looking at it like we're going 
to keep jobs for these american prison 

430
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:21,701
workers.
We're going to keep american jobs just 

431
00:20:21,701 --> 00:20:21,701
trying to get create jobs.
Joe.

432
00:20:21,701 --> 00:20:21,701
Now we're creating jobs.

433
00:20:21,701 --> 00:20:24,310
don't you see the.
The good thing behind this record,

434
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:29,590
it's spooky as a comedian.
I mean I know that like the outright is 

435
00:20:29,681 --> 00:20:33,760
kind of blended in with like this anti 
pc culture that I think comedians relate

436
00:20:33,761 --> 00:20:38,761
to,
but like do you just wake up and things 

437
00:20:38,761 --> 00:20:38,761
like,
holy shit,

438
00:20:38,761 --> 00:20:38,761
Donald Trump.
Is the president ever?

439
00:20:38,761 --> 00:20:40,790
Are you laying stone?
Isn't it?

440
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:45,530
Before my last special,
my last special aired in november,

441
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:48,820
which is right before the election,
and I was like,

442
00:20:48,821 --> 00:20:50,740
do you know how fucking close we are?
And people were laughing,

443
00:20:50,741 --> 00:20:51,640
guy,
he's not going to win.

444
00:20:51,641 --> 00:20:52,820
I'm like,
no,

445
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:55,180
he's fucking right there.
It could happen.

446
00:20:55,181 --> 00:20:58,090
And then boom,
he became president and I just like,

447
00:20:58,091 --> 00:21:00,970
wow.
It's so surreal,

448
00:21:00,971 --> 00:21:05,971
but it,
it highlights to me how preposterous 

449
00:21:05,971 --> 00:21:07,540
this system of having one person run 
this whole thing is.

450
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,240
It doesn't an any.
I know there's a cabinet.

451
00:21:10,241 --> 00:21:13,060
I know.
I understand the legislation legislative

452
00:21:13,061 --> 00:21:18,061
process.
I understand there's a senate and the 

453
00:21:18,061 --> 00:21:18,061
congress,
I can't.

454
00:21:18,061 --> 00:21:21,500
I get it,
but still he's got a lot of fucking 

455
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:21,500
power.
He's did.

456
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,700
What was the thing that he shut down?
He shutting down the epa database.

457
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,960
Oh yeah,
yeah.

458
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:27,910
When they had to like start rogue 
twitter accounts,

459
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:32,911
they're like,
we need to put out the climate data in 

460
00:21:32,911 --> 00:21:32,911
case trump deletes it.
It'S like,

461
00:21:32,911 --> 00:21:32,911
how does,
how does he have this much?

462
00:21:32,911 --> 00:21:37,501
exactly.
How does the executive branch have this 

463
00:21:37,501 --> 00:21:37,501
much power?

464
00:21:37,501 --> 00:21:40,050
I think he's just doing shit and then 
they have to stop it somehow or another 

465
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:41,320
and no one wants to stop it.
Like he's.

466
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:44,650
He's just doing shit.
Whether or not he can or can't do shit.

467
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,010
I mean he's just doing it and then you 
have to figure out a way to reverse it,

468
00:21:48,011 --> 00:21:53,011
but it's already getting done like the 
epa standards that some spooky shit 

469
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:55,480
because that's the literally the ground 
that we grow our food in.

470
00:21:55,481 --> 00:22:00,481
The water that we drink,
the air that we breathe is one of the 

471
00:22:00,481 --> 00:22:00,640
most important things,
but it becomes this.

472
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:05,140
It becomes this ideological issue 
between right and left were right,

473
00:22:05,141 --> 00:22:10,141
wants work and jobs and industry and 
left once water to be clean and like 

474
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:14,220
it's fucking insane that that became one
of those issues that it's.

475
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,720
It's an ideological thing that if you're
on the right,

476
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:20,230
you're supposed to,
if not deny climate change.

477
00:22:20,231 --> 00:22:22,600
You're supposed to ignore it at the very
least,

478
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:27,790
and if you're on the left,
you're supposed to be a tree hugger and 

479
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:28,090
a hippie and you're supposed to be all 
about clean water.

480
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:33,360
The fact that these people can make 
these distinctions like that and then 

481
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:37,870
figure out a way to make money despite 
that you're poisoning the mother earth.

482
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,250
It's just.
It's insane.

483
00:22:39,251 --> 00:22:40,850
It's weird.
Yeah.

484
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:42,370
It's like there's gotta be another way 
to make money,

485
00:22:42,371 --> 00:22:43,060
guys.
Yeah.

486
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:48,300
You know what I mean?
There's got to be this coal mining 

487
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:48,300
thing.
You're going to read

488
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,730
night coal mining.
Trump kept calling it clean coal like,

489
00:22:49,731 --> 00:22:51,770
what are you talking about?
Are we living in the fifties,

490
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:53,610
eat it,
eat it,

491
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,820
eat it,
drink the water in flint,

492
00:22:55,821 --> 00:22:56,320
and it was like,
oh,

493
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:57,380
water is clean.
We're all good.

494
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,350
FuckIng evacuate.
Immediately

495
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:05,900
pa as a different store,
the agency says it has no plans to shut 

496
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:09,201
down the website,
much less bury the data it makes 

497
00:23:09,201 --> 00:23:09,201
accessible and never did.
Okay,

498
00:23:09,201 --> 00:23:10,530
so they are fighting back.

499
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:14,230
No way.
So the epa is not.

500
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:16,540
So the data is not.
So were.

501
00:23:16,541 --> 00:23:18,370
Who were those robots?
Can fake news?

502
00:23:18,371 --> 00:23:20,380
Who were those rogue accounts that were 
saying,

503
00:23:20,381 --> 00:23:21,180
oh,
we're gonna

504
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,030
the,
uh,

505
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:25,700
the story where you came from like a 
context,

506
00:23:25,701 --> 00:23:27,890
or excuse me,
data taken out of context from the trump

507
00:23:27,891 --> 00:23:31,160
administration.
They are gonna maybe take out 31 percent

508
00:23:31,161 --> 00:23:32,210
of the epa budget,

509
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:37,240
but they're just going to get to the 
pentagon.

510
00:23:38,601 --> 00:23:39,620
You heard about that too,
right?

511
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,450
Twenty five percent in the cut in the 
workforce.

512
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:47,480
So they're going to get rid of 25 
percent of the epa far as the workforce 

513
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,220
and in 31 percent of the money.
That's hilarious.

514
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:51,860
So that means the people that remain are
gonna leave.

515
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:57,100
because look,
if you cut out 31 percent and then 25 

516
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:57,170
percent of the workforce,
that means you're cutting out more money

517
00:23:57,171 --> 00:24:01,330
than you are cutting out people.
so I guarantee you that's going to,

518
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:03,770
that's goIng to equate to people 
leaving.

519
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:09,480
Yeah.
And the whole like climate accords or 

520
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:09,480
whatever that,
you know,

521
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,641
the us is not only the biggest polluter,
the pentagon pollutes more than any 

522
00:24:12,641 --> 00:24:13,120
other entity in the world.
But then yeah,

523
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:16,030
the pentagon itself,
just the military.

524
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:21,180
Oh yeah.
All the billions of plastic debris in 

525
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:21,340
the ocean.
All the fucking bombs exploding.

526
00:24:21,341 --> 00:24:22,840
God knows what we're doing around the 
world.

527
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:23,980
Um,
but yeah,

528
00:24:23,981 --> 00:24:28,981
I mean when the pentagon is the biggest 
polluter and then you pull out of the 

529
00:24:28,981 --> 00:24:30,190
paris accords or whatever,
like trump was just like,

530
00:24:30,191 --> 00:24:35,191
yeah,
like we're going to pull out of that 

531
00:24:35,191 --> 00:24:35,191
climate change agreement.
It's like,

532
00:24:35,191 --> 00:24:35,191
well,
who's going to hold it together?

533
00:24:35,191 --> 00:24:37,030
Then it already wasn't enough weight and
you know,

534
00:24:37,031 --> 00:24:42,031
it's like these.
And then he just puts exxon mobil in 

535
00:24:42,031 --> 00:24:42,031
charge of the state department.
I mean,

536
00:24:42,031 --> 00:24:45,331
it's so much crazier than halliburton.
It's so much crazier than condoleeza 

537
00:24:45,331 --> 00:24:46,990
rice has ties to exxon,
the actual ceo.

538
00:24:46,991 --> 00:24:48,970
I just can't even wrap my mind around 
it.

539
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:50,900
It is amazing.
I mean,

540
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,120
it's amazing that we didn't learn from 
the dick cheney

541
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:57,360
exxon.
They're like,

542
00:24:57,361 --> 00:24:58,890
run the country like a business.
It's like,

543
00:24:58,891 --> 00:25:03,891
all right,
I'm just going to put actual ceos in 

544
00:25:03,891 --> 00:25:03,891
charge of all these departments and 
that's going to be good.

545
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,310
Like,
is thAt fucking good?

546
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:10,400
Well,
it would be good if you streamline the 

547
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,491
business and tried to make it more 
practical and cut out waste and 

548
00:25:13,491 --> 00:25:16,170
bureaucracy and red tape and made it 
better for everybody,

549
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:18,270
but as soon as you start saying things 
like,

550
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:23,580
we're going to shut down all those 
satellites that track global warming,

551
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,720
like,
whoa,

552
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:27,060
why?
Why you doing that?

553
00:25:27,061 --> 00:25:28,950
Shouldn't we know what the fuck is 
happening?

554
00:25:28,951 --> 00:25:31,740
Shouldn't we know?
Shouldn't we have good estimates is when

555
00:25:31,741 --> 00:25:33,330
the people in miami,
you're going to drown,

556
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:35,270
right?
Because they're going to drown.

557
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:38,060
They're going to droWn in a 40 or 50 
years or so.

558
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:39,750
People in miami are fucked.

559
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:45,060
Those people are fucking put that head.
The head of the epa is a climate change 

560
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,150
denier.
He was a guy like embroiled in a lawsuit

561
00:25:46,151 --> 00:25:47,470
against the epa.
Yeah.

562
00:25:47,471 --> 00:25:48,310
That's not good,
rIght?

563
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:50,110
No,
I would say that's not a good thing.

564
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:53,230
Now that guy have you look at every 
department,

565
00:25:53,231 --> 00:25:54,550
rick perry,
the guy who's,

566
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:59,580
you know,
we go from dancing with the stars and 

567
00:25:59,580 --> 00:25:59,580
now he's in charge of the department.
He wanted to abolish.

568
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:00,660
Did you on dancing with the stars?
Yeah.

569
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,960
And then he was like,
he wanted to abolish the energy 

570
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,161
department and then of course he's 
appoinTed to run the energy department 

571
00:26:08,161 --> 00:26:09,030
and didn't even know what the hell it 
did the energy department,

572
00:26:09,031 --> 00:26:12,340
like as is what houses are like nuclear 
weapons.

573
00:26:12,341 --> 00:26:12,880
So it's like,
okay,

574
00:26:12,881 --> 00:26:15,340
did you know that?
Like how stupid are you?

575
00:26:15,341 --> 00:26:19,340
How are you running for president?
How about ben carson to.

576
00:26:19,341 --> 00:26:22,420
He make him like department of houSing 
or some shit like surgeon general.

577
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:23,740
He's got damn doctor.
Yeah.

578
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,560
like instead of Like a.
Yeah,

579
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,100
instead of some surgeon,
he's like,

580
00:26:27,101 --> 00:26:27,370
yeah,

581
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,010
didn't you mAke him in charge of like 
neurosurgery?

582
00:26:30,011 --> 00:26:35,011
He's like a fucking neurosurgeons.
Shouldn't you be in charge of educating 

583
00:26:35,861 --> 00:26:38,070
the board on are the,
you know,

584
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:41,770
the government on the science behind 
neurosurgery and like let's,

585
00:26:41,771 --> 00:26:44,160
let's stay on board with all this

586
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,720
research and science.
Utilize your expertise.

587
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,900
Maybe it's like a joke.
I mean,

588
00:26:48,901 --> 00:26:50,940
the whole thing is like a reality show.
Looking back on it,

589
00:26:50,941 --> 00:26:52,210
I do think,
you know,

590
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:55,880
I believed all the polls and I was,
I don't know why because there are,

591
00:26:56,120 --> 00:27:01,120
you know,
it's coming from like this ivory tower 

592
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:01,120
elite who's totally out of touch with 
the rest of the country,

593
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:05,241
but I really did believe that trump had 
no chance because I thought hillary 

594
00:27:05,241 --> 00:27:05,340
would steal the vote.
I mean if it came down to,

595
00:27:05,341 --> 00:27:06,000
and I'm like,
they have,

596
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,560
they have measures in place.
They're really like,

597
00:27:07,561 --> 00:27:08,400
locked this dowN.
I was like,

598
00:27:08,401 --> 00:27:13,401
there's still a way,
and when he won I just couldn't believe 

599
00:27:13,401 --> 00:27:13,401
it.
But looking back on it,

600
00:27:13,401 --> 00:27:13,890
it makes so much sense.
It's like,

601
00:27:13,891 --> 00:27:18,891
how could he not have one?
Hillary was the most corrupt clay 

602
00:27:18,891 --> 00:27:21,831
candidate,
30 years of just a legacy of horrible 

603
00:27:21,831 --> 00:27:22,170
death and destruction or husband and 
ruined the economy.

604
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,210
Horrible arrogance,
right?

605
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,320
Bill clinton ruin the economy.
Deregulation up the ass.

606
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:34,160
He was an officer yet.
And that's what happens right before it 

607
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:34,160
craShes,
right?

608
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,720
The buildup of all the banking 
regulations,

609
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:40,150
the telecom communications act,
prison at a street.

610
00:27:40,151 --> 00:27:43,250
It was clinton years.
Good time.

611
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:48,430
So for vince foster trump,
trump is um,

612
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:53,070
and all the women that I raped.
How crazy was that when trump brought up

613
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:57,180
sexual assault victims?
That's hardcore.

614
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,560
I was just like,
dude,

615
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:01,680
it was right before the debate is why 
wasn't playing games?

616
00:28:01,681 --> 00:28:03,540
He was not playing games.
I had told him.

617
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:06,000
He asked you this because you're a 
journalist.

618
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:11,240
What did you think about the wiki leaks 
claim that the young man who was 

619
00:28:11,791 --> 00:28:16,190
murdered in Washington dc was the guy 
who gave them the info center,

620
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:18,490
whatever his name was.
You know,

621
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:24,330
people don't know the story.
He was a young guy who was working for 

622
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:24,330
the dnc.

623
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:26,910
He was murdered at like 3:00
in the morning or something crazy.

624
00:28:26,911 --> 00:28:30,840
They shot him in the back anD they 
didn't take anything from him.

625
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:33,030
They didn't take his wallet,
his phone,

626
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,500
his,
his cash.

627
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,830
They left everything.
So they called it a robbery,

628
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,590
a robbery tip,
but he was essentially assassinated.

629
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:44,460
And the investigation is just 
nonexistent.

630
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:49,490
You don't hear a god damn word about it.
I don't know if anybody's like 

631
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:49,490
currently,
you know,

632
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:50,310
working on it where we don't hear about 
it,

633
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:52,950
but it's not something that's brought up
in the news.

634
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:55,770
It's just one of those things.
He was killed.

635
00:28:55,771 --> 00:28:58,740
there's no leads and that's it.
It was odd that julian is.

636
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:01,430
Andre mentioned that as if it was like,
you know,

637
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,930
leading people to think that he was the 
leaker.

638
00:29:03,931 --> 00:29:05,580
I don't know.
Well,

639
00:29:05,581 --> 00:29:10,581
that's what he said is essentially his 
words to paraphrase were that there are 

640
00:29:10,581 --> 00:29:13,950
consequences to giving us information 
that's a pretty serious charge.

641
00:29:13,951 --> 00:29:16,520
Basically like he was killed.
He was alive.

642
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:19,410
If julian assange is a liar,
if that's not true,

643
00:29:19,411 --> 00:29:24,411
that everything he says has to be taken.
You have to take into consideration 

644
00:29:24,411 --> 00:29:26,580
everything he says because he's a liar 
now because he did.

645
00:29:26,581 --> 00:29:30,000
He really like.
Did he actually come out and say that or

646
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:35,001
did you kind of insinuate being this guy
was killed and that's let's find out 

647
00:29:35,251 --> 00:29:37,020
what's.
Find out what his exact words were.

648
00:29:37,021 --> 00:29:41,980
I'm pretty sure that his words were that
there are consequences for giving

649
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:45,550
us information.
It's just so crazy when you look at what

650
00:29:45,551 --> 00:29:50,551
that allegation was like,
Russia hacked our election and 52 

651
00:29:50,551 --> 00:29:53,401
percent of democratic voters actually 
think they hacked the vote when really 

652
00:29:53,401 --> 00:29:54,970
it was just pedesta fell for fucking 
phishing scam because he's an old idiot.

653
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:56,150
Yeah,
I used to.

654
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,850
That's what I heard.
Allegedly.

655
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:03,340
Well,
you know,

656
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:08,370
that guy is super problematic regardless
of how ridiculous the pizza gate thing 

657
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:09,430
is and what's real,
what's not real,

658
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:14,790
what is real is it?
Him and his brother were Close friends 

659
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:18,211
with dennis hastert who was the speaker 
of the house who was fucking kids for 

660
00:30:18,761 --> 00:30:22,570
decades,
fact these in jail for fucking kids.

661
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:27,900
That was the speaker of the house.
The idea that the speaker of the house 

662
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:30,700
could be a serial child molester and 
that's what he is.

663
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:35,910
I mean,
there's literally with the judge called 

664
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:35,910
him when he sentenced him.
That's insane.

665
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:37,270
And alan dershowitz,
trump and

666
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,230
clinton were on the lolita express.
Would that billionaire,

667
00:30:40,231 --> 00:30:42,630
that rape plane that had like a bunch of
underage girls?

668
00:30:42,631 --> 00:30:43,860
I mean all of them.
Yeah.

669
00:30:43,861 --> 00:30:45,330
What does that feel?
What does that do?

670
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:50,390
I mean,
it was just this crazy billing or who 

671
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,251
had some island that was known as some 
like sex ring and had a bunch of young 

672
00:30:52,251 --> 00:30:53,580
kids and all these.
All these dudes were.

673
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,040
We're going there.
Here it goes.

674
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:58,520
Whistleblowers go through significant 
efforts to get us material.

675
00:30:58,521 --> 00:31:01,140
Often very significant risks.
A 27 year old,

676
00:31:01,141 --> 00:31:06,141
the worse for the dnc was shot in the 
back murdered just two weeks ago for 

677
00:31:06,141 --> 00:31:07,010
unknown reasons as he was walking down 
the street and Washington.

678
00:31:07,011 --> 00:31:08,630
So,
and the guy says,

679
00:31:08,631 --> 00:31:09,860
anchor.
That was just a robbery,

680
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:12,050
not true.
NothIng was robbed.

681
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,190
Says I believe,
wasn't it?

682
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:15,110
And assad says,
no,

683
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,520
there's no finding.
So,

684
00:31:16,521 --> 00:31:17,870
uh,
and then the anchor says,

685
00:31:17,871 --> 00:31:19,640
what are you suggesting?
What are you suggesting?

686
00:31:19,641 --> 00:31:24,641
He says,
I am suggesting that our sources take 

687
00:31:24,641 --> 00:31:27,191
risks and they,
they become concerned to see things 

688
00:31:27,191 --> 00:31:28,730
occurring like that.
Huh?

689
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,650
But was he one of your sources?
Sources?

690
00:31:30,651 --> 00:31:31,610
I mean,
the anchor says,

691
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:36,910
and he says,
we don't comment on who our sources are 

692
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:39,490
and the anchor says,
but why make suggestions about a young 

693
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:39,490
guy being shot in the streets of 
Washington?

694
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:44,180
Assan says,
because we have to understand how high 

695
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:47,321
the stakes are in the United States.
our sources are sources face serious 

696
00:31:47,321 --> 00:31:51,551
risks.
That's why they come to us so we can 

697
00:31:51,551 --> 00:31:52,620
protect their anonymity.
Hmm.

698
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:58,570
I found an article about 
representational state transfer that 

699
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:02,650
series.
The government is fucking monitoring my 

700
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:06,311
conversation with abby martin.
I just want to say to the government 

701
00:32:06,311 --> 00:32:06,311
listened,
you fuCks.

702
00:32:06,311 --> 00:32:08,360
You could just watch the podcast like 
everybody else.

703
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,870
You don't have to attack my goddamn 
phone.

704
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:11,430
So that Is really great.

705
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,280
so he's kind of saying it without saying
it.

706
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:18,760
I don't know why he's doing that.
He also tweeted out some pizza gate 

707
00:32:18,801 --> 00:32:20,100
thing,
so I don't know what,

708
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:21,780
what the deal is.
We all know that,

709
00:32:21,781 --> 00:32:24,710
that that's not.
But here's the thing about the pizzagate

710
00:32:24,711 --> 00:32:26,350
thing is there's a lot of weird shit.

711
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:31,410
They're like the little international 
child molesting symbol was a part of 

712
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:33,790
their logo.
All the weird artwork that that guy.

713
00:32:33,791 --> 00:32:34,010
Okay.

714
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:35,040
Well,
I,

715
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:40,070
you know,
I did a whole expose and podesta and he 

716
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:40,100
is a bougie chef so it's not

717
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:45,100
surprising that he would talk about 
pizza as being some like really high 

718
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:48,521
brow chef and they pride themselves on 
how they cook all these expensive 

719
00:32:48,521 --> 00:32:52,240
dinners and have these dinner parties 
and then the spirit cooking thing is 

720
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,511
like they're really into this elitist 
subversive art scene and so they have.

721
00:32:55,731 --> 00:33:00,731
Yeah,
they have weird ass art and it's really 

722
00:33:00,731 --> 00:33:02,891
creepy.
Whatever they do nails when they're 

723
00:33:02,891 --> 00:33:04,901
talking about little kids coming over 
and getting in the jacuzzi and hanging 

724
00:33:04,901 --> 00:33:05,180
out with them.
The kids were going to entertain them.

725
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:05,810
I mean,
I don't know.

726
00:33:05,811 --> 00:33:08,270
I need a little bit more to,
to really go down that rabbit hole.

727
00:33:08,271 --> 00:33:09,380
Yes,
there's pedophilia.

728
00:33:09,381 --> 00:33:10,640
Yes,
it's in high places.

729
00:33:10,641 --> 00:33:13,130
The lolita express thing is a really 
glaring example,

730
00:33:13,131 --> 00:33:15,470
but in terms of like john podesta been 
involved in a,

731
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:18,220
in a pedophile sex trafficking ring,
I,

732
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:22,040
I feel like we need a little bit more to
go on because I feel like the what's out

733
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:24,140
there right now,
it seems pretty self explanatory.

734
00:33:24,141 --> 00:33:25,270
It's like the art and the

735
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,600
the cooking stuff.
I agree with you,

736
00:33:27,601 --> 00:33:32,601
but little kids coming over the house 
and getting in the jacuzzi like that 

737
00:33:32,601 --> 00:33:32,820
little kids are coming over for 
entertainment.

738
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:35,250
Did you ever read that?
I read the email.

739
00:33:35,251 --> 00:33:40,251
It did and it seemed like they're just 
really out of touch with how to talk 

740
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:43,290
about like their child fucking need to 
mask it better.

741
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:48,590
Like I have kids,
I have kids that age and if I'm in the 

742
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:50,940
I'm sending an email to someone else,
you know?

743
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,590
Oh yeah,
you know,

744
00:33:52,591 --> 00:33:54,540
blah blah,
blahs friends are coming over.

745
00:33:54,541 --> 00:33:59,541
Yeah.
I think we're going to have like pizza 

746
00:33:59,541 --> 00:34:01,131
or something.
We're going to have a pizza party for 

747
00:34:01,131 --> 00:34:01,131
the little ones.
What you just say it like that?

748
00:34:01,131 --> 00:34:01,680
Yeah.
You don't say they're going to come over

749
00:34:01,681 --> 00:34:06,681
and entertain us.
Like what were the exact pull up old 

750
00:34:06,681 --> 00:34:07,950
creepy how Alex Jones interpreted that 
was saying.

751
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:15,300
Did he get crazy?
He got super crazy about that email.

752
00:34:15,410 --> 00:34:16,770
About that email specifically being 
like,

753
00:34:16,771 --> 00:34:19,740
this is obviously like they're reaping 
these kids in the jacuzzi there.

754
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:21,600
Well,
it is weird.

755
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:26,690
I don't know what he's saying,
but there's where my favorite thing 

756
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:26,690
about alex is when he freaks out.
Then he say,

757
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:26,690
apologize.
I'm sorry.

758
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:27,710
I'm sorry.
Jump on.

759
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:32,780
Never swear like that,
but these fucking goddamn goddamn 

760
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:35,970
fucking pizza lovers.
Okay.

761
00:34:35,971 --> 00:34:38,910
We planned to heat the pool,
so a swim as a possibility.

762
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:44,120
Bonnie will uber service to transport 
ruby emerson and mave lasagna,

763
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:45,180
whatever.
Eleven,

764
00:34:45,181 --> 00:34:50,181
nine and almost seven.
So you'll have some further 

765
00:34:50,181 --> 00:34:50,730
entertainment and they will be in that 
pool for sure.

766
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:56,960
What does that mean?
Like why is he bringing kids over his 

767
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:56,960
house?
Oh no man.

768
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:59,430
The scumbag.
But that's odd.

769
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:04,560
And did you ever see that thing where a 
bright bart had said that many years ago

770
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:07,890
he made a tweet that was weird.
Super weird,

771
00:35:07,891 --> 00:35:09,030
right?
Like how does,

772
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:13,890
how does pedesta get away with being a.
What was the exact word?

773
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,230
Forget wofo.
Jamille.

774
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,880
Something about super crazy.
Yeah.

775
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:20,940
About essentially covering up for kid 
fuckers.

776
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:21,850
Well,
how weird

777
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:26,870
do you think it is that trump seems to 
be the first president or anyone really 

778
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:26,940
in a political

779
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:32,230
is how progress guru john podesta isn't 
a household name as world class under 

780
00:35:32,901 --> 00:35:34,850
age,
sex slave op cover,

781
00:35:34,851 --> 00:35:38,130
upper defending unspeakable dregs 
escapes

782
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:43,130
me really heavy in.
This was in february of 2011 before 

783
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:47,151
hastert was arrested,
so this very well could have been 

784
00:35:47,341 --> 00:35:52,341
connected by the way.
Hastert only did 15 months for being a 

785
00:35:52,341 --> 00:35:55,270
serial child molester.
What band?

786
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:58,410
And also worked for a bunch of child 
molesters that ige,

787
00:35:58,411 --> 00:36:03,411
this internet gaming entertainment 
company that just like mind virtual 

788
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:07,881
resources and world of warcraft games 
and would sell them and he was like a 

789
00:36:07,881 --> 00:36:10,950
money bundler for goldman sachs because 
he's a goldman sachs shill and he was 

790
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:11,880
working for like all the people on the 
board.

791
00:36:11,881 --> 00:36:13,560
We're just pedophiles.
Really?

792
00:36:13,561 --> 00:36:15,510
Yeah.
Yeah.

793
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:19,110
I think prince brock was one of the guys
and then one of the guys is still on the

794
00:36:19,111 --> 00:36:24,111
run and has been for the last 10 years,
so where all the pizza gate people 

795
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,710
didn't know about it.
Now they did.

796
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:30,720
I mean,
it's crazy and it's a bowling alley now 

797
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:34,731
it's going to be bowling gate,
but what do you think about trump being 

798
00:36:34,731 --> 00:36:39,201
really one of the first people who's won
a political office that has catered to 

799
00:36:39,201 --> 00:36:43,471
like the conspiracy crowds and 
conspiracy culture and the Alex Jones 

800
00:36:43,471 --> 00:36:46,401
crowd and ronald reagan figured out that
if you caught the christian right,

801
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:48,450
they will vote for you.

802
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:50,550
I mean there's a.
There's a whole market in that.

803
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:52,980
It look,
the conspiracy that look,

804
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:57,030
Alex Jones has a gigantic audience.
Tens of millions people.

805
00:36:57,031 --> 00:36:59,130
People discard him as some crazy 
outlier.

806
00:36:59,131 --> 00:37:01,470
He has an audience of tens of millions 
of people.

807
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:04,770
Huge.
He gets as many downloads as the biggest

808
00:37:04,771 --> 00:37:08,010
podcast world probably,
and he's on,

809
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,900
I don't know how many different radio 
stations,

810
00:37:09,901 --> 00:37:12,150
but I,
I want to say it's more than a hundred.

811
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:14,670
He's,
he's got a crazy reach,

812
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:20,090
so it was a wise move by trump and as 
long as he gets on alex's show and 

813
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:22,740
doesn't say anything to fucking crazy 
like those people,

814
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:24,900
like I can't believe the president is 
with alex.

815
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:28,470
You get those people and then you get 
the people that don't like alex.

816
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:32,310
You get those people to.
You get the hardcore republican base who

817
00:37:32,311 --> 00:37:35,220
just want to quote unquote make America 
great again and wear red hats.

818
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:36,540
You get those people to.

819
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,310
Yeah.
This is extremely smart.

820
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:39,290
Yeah.
That's how went.

821
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,530
I mean,
he's a reality star.

822
00:37:40,531 --> 00:37:43,020
Who won the biggest reality competition 
in the world.

823
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:44,700
You're right.
That's exactly how to put it in.

824
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:49,910
It was the first time that an actual 
popular person entered this popularity 

825
00:37:50,161 --> 00:37:51,470
contest.
That's really what,

826
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,770
happily.
Totally.

827
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:54,150
That's exactly what happened.
And you're right,

828
00:37:54,151 --> 00:37:59,151
he knew how to play the audience.
Bannon knew exactly how to work the 

829
00:37:59,151 --> 00:37:59,151
media to,
um,

830
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:03,651
it's fascinating to,
to cultivate that Alex Jones crowd 

831
00:38:03,651 --> 00:38:05,010
because people are analyzing the results
of the election and wondering,

832
00:38:05,011 --> 00:38:06,120
you know,
how do you win?

833
00:38:06,121 --> 00:38:06,900
HoW did he win?
To me,

834
00:38:06,901 --> 00:38:11,750
I feel like that's a huge component that
no one really puts any credit to is that

835
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:14,150
Alex Jones,
this,

836
00:38:14,151 --> 00:38:16,860
this like voting block that never was 
really active before,

837
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:21,920
like,
other than ron paul will also this 

838
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:21,920
outright thing that we were talking 
about.

839
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:22,290
There's a,
there's,

840
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:27,500
there's groups of people that were never
interested in politics that are now 

841
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,610
treating it the same way they treat 
sports.

842
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,760
The these guys are sports fans.
I mean,

843
00:38:32,761 --> 00:38:34,860
that's really what it's like.
It's like,

844
00:38:34,861 --> 00:38:37,390
this is my team.
I'm on team trump,

845
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:38,980
you know,
and these fucking.

846
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:40,530
It's like,
yeah,

847
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:45,250
it's a corp man in and they're showing 
up at these berkeley rallies and they're

848
00:38:45,251 --> 00:38:49,690
fighting with people now.
Like now you've got people responding.

849
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:52,210
This is one of the real problems with 
the left,

850
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:57,630
the real problem with these really 
hardcore lefties that are outraged and 

851
00:38:57,630 --> 00:39:01,651
want to do something and they want to be
positive so they want to shut down all 

852
00:39:01,651 --> 00:39:05,590
these people like milo that the thinker 
nazis or ann coulter and all these 

853
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:09,331
people.
But by doing that and by having these 

854
00:39:09,331 --> 00:39:11,671
gigantic protest and it literally 
shutting down people communicating and 

855
00:39:11,671 --> 00:39:11,680
talking.

856
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:16,950
You invite people to resist that and 
then you start these antifa people hit 

857
00:39:18,011 --> 00:39:19,930
people in the head with fucking bike 
locks.

858
00:39:19,931 --> 00:39:24,931
You see the,
they found that it was a professor that 

859
00:39:24,931 --> 00:39:27,331
was hitting people in the head with bike
locks and that this is going to have 

860
00:39:27,331 --> 00:39:30,730
people show up and want to hit you with 
something and so you can you see now,

861
00:39:30,731 --> 00:39:35,731
and I've seen plenty of footage of trump
protesters and supporters beating other 

862
00:39:35,731 --> 00:39:39,961
people out.
It's like getting comfortable on both 

863
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:39,961
sides.
Coming from both sides now,

864
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:43,200
but I almost feel like this is a 
manufactured thing because I think that 

865
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,801
there's been from the oakland area and 
I've an antifa has been showing up at 

866
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:50,910
every protest for as long as I can 
remember and the cops kind of like our 

867
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:54,361
hands off and so I feel like to provoke 
the antifa block where you know that 

868
00:39:54,581 --> 00:39:59,581
they're like really strategically 
oriented and keep going to berkeley and 

869
00:39:59,581 --> 00:40:03,091
keep going at berkeley and then making 
it like this big free speech blowout 

870
00:40:03,091 --> 00:40:03,091
where it's like,
why do you keep going?

871
00:40:03,091 --> 00:40:06,760
And like creating the situation.
You kind of know what's going to happen.

872
00:40:06,761 --> 00:40:11,761
It seems like a manufactured thing and 
then at the end of the day it makes the 

873
00:40:11,761 --> 00:40:15,361
left easier to demonize and end 
Basically protests easier to demonize 

874
00:40:15,361 --> 00:40:19,831
where now you have 200 people facing 
felony riot charges at the inauguration 

875
00:40:19,831 --> 00:40:24,601
protests and a couple of them are just 
journalists who are filming and all the 

876
00:40:24,601 --> 00:40:24,601
trump people are like,
whatever.

877
00:40:24,601 --> 00:40:26,590
They're fucking writing and they're 
fascists in there.

878
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,310
[inaudible].
It's like,

879
00:40:27,311 --> 00:40:29,770
well,
because this happened in berkeley now,

880
00:40:29,771 --> 00:40:31,920
like all protesters are,
you know,

881
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:35,850
they're scapegoated to these people and 
I still get to.

882
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:41,600
It's easy to box people in,
but I think what's going on at berkeley 

883
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,191
is it's the most outrageously liberal 
place in the country in berkeley is and 

884
00:40:44,561 --> 00:40:47,200
always has been.
Like if you go there.

885
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:52,210
Exactly.
It's so lefty that it's like it's a 

886
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:52,210
great target.

887
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:52,670
It's a great place to get things 
popping.

888
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:56,530
So if I was milo or if I was ann coulter
and what is the culture do?

889
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:58,900
I mean she Wants to sell books.
I mean she's a troll,

890
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,590
she's a troll,
she's totally patrol and we tell them to

891
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,330
be able to rule like probably ashley.
Just one of those,

892
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:06,340
she's just,
she's a performance artist.

893
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:08,620
Performance.
Exactly,

894
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:13,710
exactly.
She's absolutely a performance artist 

895
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:14,920
and not a very good one because if she 
was that in trump,

896
00:41:14,921 --> 00:41:18,370
we trust book like the whole cover,
like what in the fuck is that?

897
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:22,060
I mean it was just bizarre.
Just bizarre that,

898
00:41:22,061 --> 00:41:24,250
that like that she wrote that book.
It was almost like,

899
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:25,480
okay,
this is cheap.

900
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:30,510
Even for her,
like this is just like a cheap ploy 

901
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:30,970
during this whole trump movement.
She sees the,

902
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:33,980
the whole momentum of the country,
so she's going to write a book and

903
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:35,390
put trump in the title of it.
It's like,

904
00:41:35,391 --> 00:41:37,790
it's so stupid,
but it's weird.

905
00:41:37,791 --> 00:41:40,580
It's just weird that it's so easy,
but it makes sense.

906
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:44,510
Just like we were talking about how 
reagan sort of mobilized the right wing,

907
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:49,570
conservative people that were christians
that really weren't about politics 

908
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:51,050
before that,
and he kind of brought them in.

909
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,840
People real like they look at it and go,
hey look,

910
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:55,040
this is an angle.
You know,

911
00:41:55,041 --> 00:42:00,041
there's an angle we can take that no 
one's been taking and this you're kind 

912
00:42:00,041 --> 00:42:00,410
of like a bait and switch.
This whole mila,

913
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:04,100
mila berkeley thing becausE they know 
exactly what's going to happen when they

914
00:42:04,101 --> 00:42:09,101
go there and then of course that's 
exactly what happens and then they can 

915
00:42:09,101 --> 00:42:09,101
use it to be like free speech,
free speech.

916
00:42:09,101 --> 00:42:10,490
I mean it just.
Well he knows what he's doing.

917
00:42:10,491 --> 00:42:12,020
Yeah,
it was a clever guy.

918
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:17,470
He's very clever.
I Mean he knows exactly what he's doing 

919
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:17,720
and you know,
and milo at one point in time,

920
00:42:17,721 --> 00:42:22,721
by the way was a guy who was very anti 
hate speech,

921
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:28,750
you know,
and it was very anti shutting down 

922
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:28,750
people who were writing things to hurt 
people.

923
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:31,010
People have like pulled quotes of his 
from the past,

924
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:36,610
whiCh is intEresting because,
I mean I'm sure peOple's philosophies 

925
00:42:36,610 --> 00:42:37,370
changed.
I'm sure mine have and yours have,

926
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:42,550
but this is like one more piece of 
evidence that what you're seeing with a 

927
00:42:43,251 --> 00:42:48,251
lot of people that are in the public eye
that are involved in this whole 

928
00:42:48,251 --> 00:42:49,700
political arena is you're seeing,
they're working angles.

929
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:51,020
They're like,
what's the angle like,

930
00:42:51,021 --> 00:42:56,021
okay,
let's go that way and you can justify 

931
00:42:56,021 --> 00:42:56,021
it.
Look,

932
00:42:56,021 --> 00:42:56,150
I could justify a lot of different 
angles if I wanted to do that,

933
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:57,140
if I want it to be.

934
00:42:57,530 --> 00:43:01,240
If I wanted to be in an anti trump 
protest or an anti free speech poster,

935
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:06,280
if I wanted to be a person who thinks 
that free speech should be limited 

936
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:07,490
because hate speech is not protected by 
the constitution.

937
00:43:07,491 --> 00:43:09,980
Like howard dean just said,
that fucking asshole.

938
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:12,560
He said hate speech is not protected by 
the constitution.

939
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:13,780
The first amendment.
Yeah.

940
00:43:13,781 --> 00:43:14,780
Yes it is.
Howard.

941
00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:17,700
You fucking idiot.
You're a goddamn representative.

942
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:21,170
Nazi parties exist actually,
and they can have rallies,

943
00:43:21,171 --> 00:43:24,680
you know like that.
That happens in this country when he was

944
00:43:24,681 --> 00:43:27,740
saying it about two,
but it was ridiculous.

945
00:43:27,741 --> 00:43:28,780
Our.
He would.

946
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:31,460
The way he said it,
it wasn't even like justified.

947
00:43:31,461 --> 00:43:33,020
It wasn't like someone was saying like,
hey,

948
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:36,950
we need to gather up these gay people 
and hang them from stop signs.

949
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:42,100
That's not what people are saying.
It wasn't anything that extreme where 

950
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:42,100
he.

951
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:42,710
Oh,
I think it was ann coulter,

952
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:46,610
I think.
I'm not sure who pulled that up,

953
00:43:46,611 --> 00:43:51,611
see if you can find it.
I'm pretty sure howard dean was talking 

954
00:43:51,611 --> 00:43:54,851
about ann coulter and he was saying that
hate speech is not protected by the 

955
00:43:54,851 --> 00:43:56,590
first amendment.
So what is he advocating around to?

956
00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:00,550
Roundup angLed his arrest her for.
He's just saying that she should be.

957
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:03,270
That you can stop her talk.
He just,

958
00:44:03,290 --> 00:44:04,550
you know what?
It was our nuts.

959
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:09,640
Poorly thought out statement that got 
trampled just thrown out and everybody 

960
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:16,800
sort of repeating it over and over and 
over again and I just don't think he 

961
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:16,800
thought about it when he was saying it 
or the consequences.

962
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:17,870
Yeah.
Here it is.

963
00:44:17,871 --> 00:44:19,340
Was it about anne culter?
Yes.

964
00:44:19,341 --> 00:44:22,340
It was about hey cultures,
upcoming speech in Vermont,

965
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:24,980
the Vermont dnc chair,
howard dean,

966
00:44:24,981 --> 00:44:29,981
elaborated on his argument that ann 
coulter's upcoming speech at berkeley 

967
00:44:29,981 --> 00:44:32,040
does not have to occur because hate 
speech in

968
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,110
quotes is not protected by the first 
amendment.

969
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:35,730
Fuck you,
man.

970
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:36,890
Of course.
Look,

971
00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:40,250
just have someone to bait her.
It's not that goddamn hard her.

972
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,180
It has something to say what we're 
saying,

973
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:44,430
but what about the safe,
the safe space?

974
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:46,860
like hysteria where people are like,
we need to save spaces,

975
00:44:46,861 --> 00:44:51,861
but then,
but then there it's the same people who 

976
00:44:51,861 --> 00:44:51,861
are like,
why are you protesting as like,

977
00:44:51,861 --> 00:44:52,500
let us debate,
well then fucking what is it?

978
00:44:52,501 --> 00:44:57,501
Do you want safe spaces are not they?
Because if you want to have debates or 

979
00:44:57,501 --> 00:45:02,031
you want to have speeches,
like you can't Stop people in berkeley 

980
00:45:02,031 --> 00:45:02,910
from coming in protesting you,
it's protecting you.

981
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:07,740
It's such a fundamental idea that we all
know that in order to,

982
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:10,500
if you're gonna have a discussion with 
someone,

983
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:14,670
you have to let that person established.
This is what debates are about,

984
00:45:14,671 --> 00:45:14,880
right?

985
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:20,120
let that person establish their position
and then give your counter to that 

986
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:22,020
position.
If this is like so firmly established in

987
00:45:22,021 --> 00:45:25,440
the way we communicate and the way we go
over ideas,

988
00:45:25,441 --> 00:45:27,810
that is essentially the marketplace of 
ideas.

989
00:45:28,110 --> 00:45:30,600
You have your idea.
Someone has an opposing idea.

990
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:35,310
If you don't let that person establish 
their idea and you shut it down,

991
00:45:35,311 --> 00:45:40,311
shut it down,
and you throw in rocks and burning cop 

992
00:45:40,311 --> 00:45:40,500
cars and throwing bricks through 
starbucks.

993
00:45:40,501 --> 00:45:45,501
Windows like you are feeding the whole 
resistance to your ideas.

994
00:45:45,991 --> 00:45:47,550
Flames like you're,
you're,

995
00:45:47,551 --> 00:45:52,551
you're,
you're feeding the people that are 

996
00:45:52,551 --> 00:45:56,301
saying that they're right and you're 
wrong because you are against recently 

997
00:45:56,301 --> 00:46:00,200
cheating feeding that again.
People sympathize with like Richard 

998
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:00,810
Spencer after he got punched,
you know,

999
00:46:00,811 --> 00:46:01,890
and that's,
that's a problem.

1000
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:07,040
Yeah,
it's a problem because all you have to 

1001
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:07,040
do is let those people hang themselves,
give them a rope,

1002
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:10,410
give them broad plenum talk,
but you have to have someone qualified.

1003
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:13,410
You have to have someone who can have 
that speech with them and you can't have

1004
00:46:13,411 --> 00:46:15,210
the fucking audience shout them down 
either.

1005
00:46:15,211 --> 00:46:17,540
It's a disservice to both ideas,
both,

1006
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:22,970
but I've heard people say like as 
nazi-ism really a an idea worthwhile of 

1007
00:46:22,970 --> 00:46:24,720
putting it in the marketplace of ideas 
like your advocate is genocide.

1008
00:46:24,721 --> 00:46:26,070
Okay.
Richard spencer.

1009
00:46:26,071 --> 00:46:27,240
So you that guy.
Yeah.

1010
00:46:27,241 --> 00:46:32,241
Okay.
But if you are going to have someone 

1011
00:46:32,241 --> 00:46:34,671
debate them,
you have someone debate them in a venue 

1012
00:46:34,671 --> 00:46:35,850
where let everyone watch it online.
It's like,

1013
00:46:35,851 --> 00:46:37,740
how do you debate someone that wants to 
exterminate you?

1014
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,120
like if you're like a black person,
you're like,

1015
00:46:39,121 --> 00:46:40,310
I'm in a debate.
This guy who,

1016
00:46:40,350 --> 00:46:42,900
whose main premise of the argument is 
you shouldn't exist.

1017
00:46:42,901 --> 00:46:43,950
That's kind of I,
I,

1018
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,360
I've,
I've heard people,

1019
00:46:45,650 --> 00:46:47,220
it's a,
it's a confusing topic,

1020
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:49,620
but if you don't debate them,
if you don't,

1021
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:54,330
if you shut down their speech,
if you stop and then you can,

1022
00:46:54,331 --> 00:46:57,090
they can frame what they were going to 
say in a very different way.

1023
00:46:57,330 --> 00:47:00,090
They can,
they can gather sympathy with people who

1024
00:47:00,091 --> 00:47:05,091
were more pro speech,
more pro free speech than they are anti 

1025
00:47:05,101 --> 00:47:06,470
what you're saying.
I think that they,

1026
00:47:06,471 --> 00:47:08,220
they still are a,
like we were saying before,

1027
00:47:08,221 --> 00:47:13,221
nazis still have rallies like no one is 
shutting down these from a government 

1028
00:47:13,221 --> 00:47:14,070
level.
So I think the whole censorship thing is

1029
00:47:14,071 --> 00:47:17,700
not relevant to this situation because 
that really does mean like the black end

1030
00:47:17,701 --> 00:47:21,390
of the state like coming down and 
blocking you and instead we have what we

1031
00:47:21,391 --> 00:47:26,220
cntf a blocking like physically these,
these venues.

1032
00:47:26,221 --> 00:47:31,221
But it's not like these people are 
blocked from having venues or access or 

1033
00:47:31,221 --> 00:47:31,221
speech

1034
00:47:31,221 --> 00:47:31,900
platforms.
I mean they're fucking everywhere.

1035
00:47:31,901 --> 00:47:34,600
It's like I feel like all over the news,
it's Richard Spencer,

1036
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:37,990
the dapper nazi,
like all these interviews,

1037
00:47:38,070 --> 00:47:43,070
aren't these speeches in this one place?
Aren't they very retro like why even do 

1038
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:45,160
it that way?
Why have an audience?

1039
00:47:45,161 --> 00:47:50,161
Why have an angry mom yelling outside or
even inside like create and cultivate 

1040
00:47:50,261 --> 00:47:52,060
these situations and they can be the 
martyrs,

1041
00:47:52,061 --> 00:47:52,930
right?
That free speech,

1042
00:47:52,931 --> 00:47:54,610
martyrs.
That's exactly what they're doing.

1043
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:59,640
It's a very poor way to go over ideas 
though I think a better way to go over 

1044
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:03,811
ideas.
As you have a moderator and two people 

1045
00:48:03,811 --> 00:48:06,781
in a room together,
you know that that simple one person 

1046
00:48:06,781 --> 00:48:09,970
isn't a lot of time where they can 
express themselves than the other person

1047
00:48:09,971 --> 00:48:14,530
has a lot of time where they can counter
and you're not allowed to chime in.

1048
00:48:14,531 --> 00:48:15,760
You're not allowed to interrupt.

1049
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:20,140
You're not allowed to in any way disrupt
this person's flow of ideas.

1050
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:25,380
Then there should be a time set aside 
where you could Go back and forth with 

1051
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:27,340
each other and unless you do it that 
way,

1052
00:48:27,550 --> 00:48:30,070
you're going to involve the cult of 
personality.

1053
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:32,350
You're going to involve the cheers from 
the crowds.

1054
00:48:32,351 --> 00:48:37,351
You're going to involve all these 
different people that can organize to 

1055
00:48:37,351 --> 00:48:38,190
Sway things one way or another or all 
this,

1056
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:39,910
shut it down,
shut it down,

1057
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:41,160
shut it down,
and it's.

1058
00:48:41,230 --> 00:48:46,230
It gets as ridiculous as like Jordan 
Peterson speeches and I'm sure you've 

1059
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:49,621
seen that professor of university of 
toronto that doesn't want to use all 

1060
00:48:49,621 --> 00:48:49,621
these meetup,
gender pronouns.

1061
00:48:49,621 --> 00:48:53,850
The 78 now accepted gender pronouns 
Canada has really weird laws in Canada.

1062
00:48:54,611 --> 00:48:59,611
Has they don't have free speech the way 
we have free speech and they have a 

1063
00:48:59,611 --> 00:49:02,821
human rights council and they've decided
that these 78 or whatever the fuck they 

1064
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:09,541
are,
however many they decide on gender 

1065
00:49:09,541 --> 00:49:09,541
pronouns,
that if you don't use them,

1066
00:49:09,541 --> 00:49:09,880
if someone says,
you know,

1067
00:49:09,881 --> 00:49:13,750
I want you to call me fox can 26,
but for real,

1068
00:49:14,350 --> 00:49:17,680
like if you don't do that,
you're imposing on their human rights.

1069
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:23,280
Other people have debated him and said 
that though that's not how it should be 

1070
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,911
interpreted,
but he's like a very staunch critic of 

1071
00:49:26,911 --> 00:49:30,001
marxism and he understands the,
the real ideology of marxism and how it 

1072
00:49:30,001 --> 00:49:31,330
went horribly wrong all throughout the 
world,

1073
00:49:31,331 --> 00:49:36,331
throughout history,
and that he thinks that what you're 

1074
00:49:36,331 --> 00:49:39,190
trying to do when you,
when you're invoking like this,

1075
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:44,220
when you're asking the government to 
tell people what they must or must not 

1076
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:46,810
say,
that you are going down this road,

1077
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:49,420
this very dangerous road of cultural 
marxist.

1078
00:49:49,421 --> 00:49:50,560
Well,
what does cultural marxism,

1079
00:49:50,561 --> 00:49:55,561
because I've heard this said and I 
actually have no idea what the hell it 

1080
00:49:55,561 --> 00:49:57,070
means because marxism is simply a 
critique on capitalism,

1081
00:49:57,071 --> 00:49:59,490
so I don't understand this whole 
cultural marxism like,

1082
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:04,560
well,
let's let's get the dead house has 

1083
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:05,380
anything to do with gender pronouns,
but you'd have to talk to peterson about

1084
00:50:05,381 --> 00:50:05,730
how it.

1085
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:09,600
But he makes a very compelling argument 
about how the two of them are connected.

1086
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:14,640
Essentially what people are trying to do
is control your behavior and they're 

1087
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:18,611
just trying to in some way force you to 
behave the way they would like you to 

1088
00:50:19,151 --> 00:50:21,010
behave,
even if it's a preposterous thing,

1089
00:50:21,011 --> 00:50:24,160
like making up words and you have to 
call them this instead of he,

1090
00:50:24,161 --> 00:50:29,161
she or even like even like the people 
that want to use they riches know 

1091
00:50:30,190 --> 00:50:31,610
plurals,
which is fine.

1092
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:34,130
I mean like that's a real word,
you know,

1093
00:50:34,131 --> 00:50:36,830
if you want to use it in an incorrect 
way and it does get used like,

1094
00:50:37,070 --> 00:50:37,980
you know,
uh,

1095
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:41,360
it does use like if anybody wants to use
the bathroom,

1096
00:50:41,361 --> 00:50:46,361
they can go ahead.
You can be using that in a singular 

1097
00:50:46,361 --> 00:50:46,361
term,
you know,

1098
00:50:46,361 --> 00:50:46,361
and you,
you're,

1099
00:50:46,361 --> 00:50:50,230
it's non gender specific.
So there is like open interpretation in 

1100
00:50:50,361 --> 00:50:52,460
the stanDard use of it in the english 
language.

1101
00:50:52,790 --> 00:50:55,340
So pulled up the term cultural marxism

1102
00:50:56,210 --> 00:51:01,210
that was looking for.
I can't really find a great definition 

1103
00:51:01,210 --> 00:51:01,210
for it.
Uh,

1104
00:51:01,210 --> 00:51:02,270
it's a couple like the google research 
assistants,

1105
00:51:02,290 --> 00:51:04,630
a couple of things.
Calling it a conspiracy theory,

1106
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:11,240
the urban dictionary definition.
This isn't like an obvious social 

1107
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:14,190
political movement that promotes 
unreasoned and irrationality through the

1108
00:51:14,191 --> 00:51:17,720
guise of various causes offering 
promoted by so called social jet.

1109
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:22,750
This is a perfect example of it.
These causes and their proponents often 

1110
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:25,740
are often contradictory and are almost 
always never rooted.

1111
00:51:25,741 --> 00:51:30,741
in fact indeed true argument or 
discussion with proponents of these 

1112
00:51:30,741 --> 00:51:34,971
causes.
It's almost impossible at most as most 

1113
00:51:34,971 --> 00:51:36,720
attempts at discourse descend quickly 
into shouting name,

1114
00:51:36,721 --> 00:51:38,280
calling and chanting slogans.
Well,

1115
00:51:38,281 --> 00:51:41,040
that's a perfect otherwise known as the 
regressive

1116
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:43,170
left a plate on the contradictory 
nature.

1117
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:48,520
I think that this is,
this seems to be like a hub of the alt 

1118
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:49,440
right word.
This is founded on like this reactionary

1119
00:51:49,441 --> 00:51:51,660
movement on pc culture,
on things like that,

1120
00:51:51,661 --> 00:51:56,661
gender pronouns thing,
and it seems like there was no real 

1121
00:51:56,661 --> 00:52:00,360
political ideology behind what is the 
outright other than just a reaction to 

1122
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:04,341
this.
like I don't want to conform to this 

1123
00:52:04,341 --> 00:52:04,341
progressive whatever,
cultural marxism,

1124
00:52:04,341 --> 00:52:07,080
but to me I feel like I just.
I don't knoW.

1125
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:12,250
It doesn't bother me as much.
Like what bothers me right now is just 

1126
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:12,480
like the empire fucking killing people 
on my name.

1127
00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:15,300
Trump.
No disgusting war criminal who's flipped

1128
00:52:15,301 --> 00:52:17,000
flopped on all the shit that he said 
that he said.

1129
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:19,170
That's a different argument,
but you're absolutely right.

1130
00:52:19,190 --> 00:52:22,950
That's what I'm saying is these people 
are that upset about leftists,

1131
00:52:22,951 --> 00:52:27,951
like they think leftists are the problem
and that cultural marxism is like 

1132
00:52:27,951 --> 00:52:28,620
ruining society and it's like,
what is this government doing?

1133
00:52:28,621 --> 00:52:30,780
Like The answer never stopped with when 
trump won.

1134
00:52:30,810 --> 00:52:33,030
Jordan peterson a,
he's progressive.

1135
00:52:33,090 --> 00:52:33,900
He's a liberal.

1136
00:52:34,590 --> 00:52:39,590
So this,
I mean the guy who's arguing against 

1137
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:40,320
cultural marxism.
Marxism is actually a progressive.

1138
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:42,660
He's actually the liberal.
I mean he's not,

1139
00:52:42,690 --> 00:52:44,940
he's not a republican.
He's definitely not outright.

1140
00:52:44,941 --> 00:52:47,310
He's canadian.
So they obviously have different parties

1141
00:52:47,311 --> 00:52:49,320
up there,
but he's not an alright guy.

1142
00:52:49,321 --> 00:52:51,990
He's a professor.
I mean he's not,

1143
00:52:52,050 --> 00:52:57,050
he's just sees that there's a bunch of 
people on campus that are trying to 

1144
00:52:57,211 --> 00:52:58,950
control the way other people 
communicate.

1145
00:52:59,310 --> 00:53:00,970
It'S just such as poor posture.
Yeah,

1146
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:05,980
I,
I totally hear that and I see where 

1147
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:05,980
people are really upset about that and 
it just,

1148
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:10,320
you know,
I see sj was in leftists are ruining 

1149
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:10,510
everything and to me it just seemed like
such an isolated,

1150
00:53:10,511 --> 00:53:14,830
like totally inconsequential thing to 
what's going on in the rest of the world

1151
00:53:14,831 --> 00:53:17,740
and especially what trump is ramming 
down everyone's throats.

1152
00:53:17,741 --> 00:53:19,810
It's like,
is this really the main issue here?

1153
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:20,830
No,
it's not,

1154
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:22,450
but I agree with you to a certain 
extent,

1155
00:53:22,451 --> 00:53:25,030
but to not address that or to write it 
off,

1156
00:53:25,470 --> 00:53:26,250
it empowers

1157
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:30,540
the people that are fighting against it 
because this year you're ignoring it.

1158
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:33,990
Like to them it'S a giant issue.
The issue of free speech,

1159
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:39,260
the issue of not having people in force,
whatever ideology that they have on you 

1160
00:53:41,011 --> 00:53:44,430
that you have to behave the way they 
want you to communicate,

1161
00:53:44,431 --> 00:53:47,700
they want you to or you're a bigot or 
you're a nazi,

1162
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:52,760
like punch a nazi.
Meanwhile you're an actual christian 

1163
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:55,050
evangelicals employing top down policy 
that's actually telling people,

1164
00:53:55,051 --> 00:53:56,640
here's how education's going to be 
around here,

1165
00:53:56,641 --> 00:54:01,641
so we're going to be indoctrinated.
Like that's what I feel like we're 

1166
00:54:01,641 --> 00:54:04,641
really missing the boat here.
All these new atheists who agree with 

1167
00:54:04,641 --> 00:54:07,911
what you're saying,
like don't want to be policed and aRe 

1168
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:11,270
more in line with trump.
How come they're not speaking out 

1169
00:54:11,270 --> 00:54:12,600
against the christian evangelical hold 
over this adMinistration?

1170
00:54:13,090 --> 00:54:14,430
Well,
which ones are you talking about?

1171
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:15,870
Like,
oh,

1172
00:54:15,871 --> 00:54:18,390
I know.
I don't know.

1173
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:23,480
I just kind of said that in the ether,
but I guess I just haven't seen enough 

1174
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:26,280
critique of trump for bringing in this 
religious fanaticism,

1175
00:54:26,370 --> 00:54:27,090
rc.
Nothing.

1176
00:54:27,091 --> 00:54:32,091
But I've seen really great.
Maybe it's really good to hear it in 

1177
00:54:32,091 --> 00:54:32,190
different circles.
That's great.

1178
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:34,050
But um,
people are talking about that.

1179
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:39,080
Well,
what'S weird is that people think that 

1180
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:41,631
trump is so inept.
They almost would prefer mike pence and 

1181
00:54:41,631 --> 00:54:42,810
even ted cruz.
Terrifying,

1182
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:48,050
but it mean who's is it better or worse?
It's like you're not even choosing the 

1183
00:54:48,050 --> 00:54:52,161
lesser of two evils.
You're choosing in competence versus 

1184
00:54:52,161 --> 00:54:55,730
this radical right wing christian 
ideology that we were terrified of in 

1185
00:54:56,131 --> 00:55:01,131
the beginning or from the beginning.
It's like ted cruz would have been a 

1186
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:05,511
terrible president,
but many people now think he would've 

1187
00:55:05,511 --> 00:55:08,180
been a better president than Donald 
Trump and ted cruz and mike pence would 

1188
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:10,560
never have won because they're 
disgusting creatures and ted cruz is the

1189
00:55:10,561 --> 00:55:12,600
creepiest motherfucker I've ever seen 
where he.

1190
00:55:12,630 --> 00:55:17,630
He actually tweeted a photo of like a 
butterfly cow made out of butter and 

1191
00:55:17,630 --> 00:55:18,180
said,
and he was like,

1192
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:21,330
my daughter's first word was butter.
It's like,

1193
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:23,160
wow,
you creepy psycho.

1194
00:55:23,510 --> 00:55:25,140
So that creepy to you.
That's creepy.

1195
00:55:25,141 --> 00:55:26,280
It's weird.
It's just weird.

1196
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:28,200
It's just really in a butter.
Butter is delicious.

1197
00:55:28,201 --> 00:55:30,660
It is delicious bread on toast.
He's super fucking weird.

1198
00:55:30,661 --> 00:55:35,661
But yeah,
these people would never win without 

1199
00:55:35,661 --> 00:55:35,661
trump being that conduit to like get in 
the white house.

1200
00:55:35,661 --> 00:55:36,630
And so I think that with trump not 
there,

1201
00:55:36,631 --> 00:55:38,010
you don't have this veneer where people 
are like,

1202
00:55:38,011 --> 00:55:38,970
oh,
trump's really liberal.

1203
00:55:38,971 --> 00:55:39,390
Like,
oh no,

1204
00:55:39,391 --> 00:55:44,391
he really believes in this stuff.
It's like you would just have pence and 

1205
00:55:44,391 --> 00:55:46,941
that would be really straightforward of 
exactly who pence is and what he 

1206
00:55:46,941 --> 00:55:46,941
believes in.
Well,

1207
00:55:46,941 --> 00:55:48,150
marco rubIo sucks as a debater,
but god damn,

1208
00:55:48,151 --> 00:55:51,210
he's an eloquent and really well spoken 
man.

1209
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:54,690
OutsIde of those debates.
He just folded under pressure.

1210
00:55:54,691 --> 00:55:57,630
He's not good with conflict,
but he's been outstanding.

1211
00:55:58,250 --> 00:56:00,120
Yeah,
he's been outstandIng since then.

1212
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:02,010
He just doesn't know how to deal with 
that.

1213
00:56:02,130 --> 00:56:06,270
That big fucking looming cultive 
personality asshole,

1214
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:07,890
and he just doesn't know how to deal 
with it.

1215
00:56:08,130 --> 00:56:10,590
Trump is such a baby.
He's such a pamper baby.

1216
00:56:10,591 --> 00:56:13,260
I saw this chart of um,
how many times,

1217
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:13,770
like,
you know,

1218
00:56:13,771 --> 00:56:17,340
this is kind of a stupid thing because 
I'm not opposed to like taking vacations

1219
00:56:17,341 --> 00:56:19,820
or golfing or whatever,
but the amount that he's gone where he's

1220
00:56:19,821 --> 00:56:20,940
just like gone.
Half the weekend.

1221
00:56:20,970 --> 00:56:21,930
Maro lago,
like golf.

1222
00:56:21,950 --> 00:56:26,830
They Spent $10 so far in the first 
hundred days,

1223
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:32,250
trump spent almost as much money as 
obama did an entire year on his 

1224
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:35,560
vacation.
That's the first one.

1225
00:56:35,561 --> 00:56:37,510
Hundred days.
So pampered.

1226
00:56:37,511 --> 00:56:42,511
He can't even get away from this world 
that he's a part of where he has to go 

1227
00:56:42,511 --> 00:56:43,660
to a fucking country club and be 
surrounded by billionaires.

1228
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:48,700
It's also so incredibly hypocritical 
because he was constantly complaining 

1229
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:50,800
about obama taking vacations and going 
golf and he's golf more than anybody.

1230
00:56:51,070 --> 00:56:52,630
You look at the first hundred days of 
clinton,

1231
00:56:52,631 --> 00:56:53,920
bush,
obama and him.

1232
00:56:53,921 --> 00:56:57,760
It's like no one has done this.
I think obama maybe went golfing once in

1233
00:56:57,761 --> 00:56:59,650
the first hundred days and trump is like
every week,

1234
00:56:59,651 --> 00:57:02,110
four out of seven days.
He's just gone.

1235
00:57:02,111 --> 00:57:03,700
It's like,
who's running the country here?

1236
00:57:04,110 --> 00:57:06,220
It is weird.
It's crazy.

1237
00:57:06,310 --> 00:57:11,310
I just want to finish yesterday or 
sunday that he hasn't taken a 

1238
00:57:11,310 --> 00:57:15,300
international trip yet and at this point
I think George Bush had taken to and 

1239
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:19,621
obama taken a too busy at maro lago 
international trip for out of the 

1240
00:57:19,621 --> 00:57:22,180
country to go meet another leader.
Come to make that come to me.

1241
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:24,750
Come play golf.
Come on.

1242
00:57:24,751 --> 00:57:28,060
I got a great place.
We have the best,

1243
00:57:28,061 --> 00:57:31,150
the best steaks,
the best come back.

1244
00:57:31,151 --> 00:57:33,790
We really do.
We really do remember how weird that was

1245
00:57:33,791 --> 00:57:38,791
when even have all these props like the 
steaks and the manila folders and all 

1246
00:57:38,791 --> 00:57:39,480
these things like on the magazines and 
jet.

1247
00:57:39,481 --> 00:57:41,050
He loved all these props,
number that.

1248
00:57:41,190 --> 00:57:46,190
No,
he was doing all these campaign rallies 

1249
00:57:46,190 --> 00:57:46,510
on one one campaign.
Rally had a bunch of trump steaks out on

1250
00:57:46,511 --> 00:57:47,050
a table.

1251
00:57:50,290 --> 00:57:52,870
I didn't even know trump steaks until 
last week.

1252
00:57:53,590 --> 00:57:56,920
Was it moshe?
Moshe turned me on to trump steaks.

1253
00:57:57,590 --> 00:58:02,590
Moshe is a emotion.
Casher was a show that's on comedy 

1254
00:58:02,590 --> 00:58:02,590
central right now.
Moshe is a super hardcore lefty.

1255
00:58:02,890 --> 00:58:07,890
It's really interesting because he and I
were having this conversation on the 

1256
00:58:07,890 --> 00:58:07,890
phone last night or texting back and 
forth.

1257
00:58:07,890 --> 00:58:08,590
He goes,
we were talking about.

1258
00:58:08,591 --> 00:58:13,591
He's at.
He asked me to find like a suitable 

1259
00:58:13,591 --> 00:58:16,141
representative of the alt right come on 
his show and sort of talk about these 

1260
00:58:16,141 --> 00:58:17,050
ideas.
I my poor boy,

1261
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:22,030
who the fuck is a suitable represent 
sorry.

1262
00:58:22,031 --> 00:58:24,940
Through some people at adam,
every name I threw out and he's like,

1263
00:58:25,010 --> 00:58:28,090
oh no,
I know,

1264
00:58:28,091 --> 00:58:29,650
but that's what you're asking for it.
He's like,

1265
00:58:29,651 --> 00:58:31,780
milo would have been great,
but he's so tainted now.

1266
00:58:31,781 --> 00:58:32,280
I'm like,
yeah,

1267
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:35,290
I get it.
Pedophilia is the thing that brought him

1268
00:58:35,291 --> 00:58:39,250
down and it was just crazy of all 
places.

1269
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:39,730
It's like,
wow.

1270
00:58:39,731 --> 00:58:41,990
They did lose three hours.
He got loose,

1271
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:43,840
started talking about what your 
reaction.

1272
00:58:43,890 --> 00:58:45,820
Your reaction was really fun in that 
too.

1273
00:58:45,821 --> 00:58:47,620
You're like,
that sounds like.

1274
00:58:47,950 --> 00:58:50,080
Well,
he was trying to justify his own,

1275
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:53,320
his own victimization.
He was molested as a child.

1276
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:55,480
Was trying to turn around and say that 
he was.

1277
00:58:55,930 --> 00:58:57,210
He said,
I was the predator.

1278
00:58:57,910 --> 00:59:02,910
Don't get it wrong.
He's basically trying to empower 

1279
00:59:03,161 --> 00:59:08,161
himself.
He was fucked by a priest when he was 

1280
00:59:08,161 --> 00:59:08,590
13.
I mean this is the reality of his life.

1281
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:13,980
That is terrible.
And he's trying to figure out a way 

1282
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:18,721
where that empowers him and I just find 
it interesting like the tommy lauren 

1283
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:19,180
thing was fired because she was pro 
choice.

1284
00:59:19,181 --> 00:59:21,040
It's like that went too far for the 
blaze.

1285
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:23,280
Know,
like the pedophilia things too far for,

1286
00:59:23,281 --> 00:59:24,390
for the outright.
Right.

1287
00:59:24,530 --> 00:59:25,910
I was thinking that about hillary 
clinton.

1288
00:59:25,910 --> 00:59:29,630
How crazy would it be if chelsea clinton
went to work for the blaze?

1289
00:59:29,870 --> 00:59:31,640
Oh god.
If she started,

1290
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:34,310
she started going super hardcore.
Right?

1291
00:59:34,311 --> 00:59:38,080
And she's got two flags,
motorcycle jacket on,

1292
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:39,980
pearly whites.
The hedges.

1293
00:59:39,981 --> 00:59:41,690
Go interrupt those.
Antiwar demonstrations.

1294
00:59:41,691 --> 00:59:42,500
Again,
chelsea,

1295
00:59:43,270 --> 00:59:46,730
just like you used to be a nightmare.
I mean this,

1296
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:48,270
what do you think about the Syria thing 
though?

1297
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:51,140
Trump within two days of the chemical 
weapons attack,

1298
00:59:51,141 --> 00:59:54,170
he's already bombing assad and that was 
a big point of contention.

1299
00:59:54,171 --> 00:59:56,690
I know with the Alex Jones communiTy 
with the alt right.

1300
00:59:56,810 --> 01:00:01,810
I think a lot of them were anti 
intervention because that's what he was 

1301
01:00:01,810 --> 01:00:01,940
saying and so what is,
what do you think is going on?

1302
01:00:01,941 --> 01:00:03,290
Because you have that whole argument 
where like,

1303
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:08,320
oh,
all these people are pulling them in 

1304
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:08,320
different directions.
He doesn't really want to do this.

1305
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:08,320
What do you think?

1306
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:09,650
Well,
I think he's incredibly impulsive.

1307
01:00:09,850 --> 01:00:12,740
I mean that's sort of been established 
that he's very impulsive.

1308
01:00:12,741 --> 01:00:17,741
So I also think that he's got this 
desire to be a strong leader and to be a

1309
01:00:18,681 --> 01:00:22,070
guy who make strong decisions and it's 
not going to take any bullshit,

1310
01:00:22,550 --> 01:00:24,410
you know?
And I worry about that.

1311
01:00:24,411 --> 01:00:29,411
That scares the shit out of me because 
when you really find out how much the 

1312
01:00:29,411 --> 01:00:33,820
power the president has in terms of like
launching a nuclear strike and then you 

1313
01:00:34,131 --> 01:00:36,170
look at the conflict that we're getting 
into with North Korea,

1314
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:38,330
it's entirely possible.
I mean,

1315
01:00:38,331 --> 01:00:43,331
they are moving nuclear submarines right
now as we speak off the coast of North 

1316
01:00:43,331 --> 01:00:45,290
Korea.
That is happening right now as we speak.

1317
01:00:45,291 --> 01:00:46,850
It was.
They were talking about it today.

1318
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:52,180
It's in the news right now.
This is terrifying because if they 

1319
01:00:52,180 --> 01:00:54,590
decide to launch a warhead at North 
Korea,

1320
01:00:55,310 --> 01:01:00,310
the odds of someone retaliating are so 
fucking high and if they do retaliate,

1321
01:01:00,710 --> 01:01:02,270
it's probably going to be los angeles.

1322
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:04,250
It's probably going to be.
We're the closest.

1323
01:01:04,430 --> 01:01:08,270
We're the closest to North Korea and 
we're also the closest.

1324
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:11,120
I guess we would be the target for 
China.

1325
01:01:11,420 --> 01:01:14,180
I guess we would be the target for a lot
of places.

1326
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:19,320
Yeah.
Let's talk about this North Korea thing 

1327
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:19,320
really quickly because the media is 
painting it like North Korea,

1328
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:23,870
like we're going to strike back really 
when North Korea is repeatedly said,

1329
01:01:23,871 --> 01:01:28,871
we will never striked the us ever.
Will never strike anyone unless we're 

1330
01:01:28,871 --> 01:01:32,141
attacked.
What are they doing that we're so 

1331
01:01:32,141 --> 01:01:32,180
intense with them right now?
They are doing missile,

1332
01:01:32,270 --> 01:01:34,550
missile tests.
They don't even work.

1333
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:37,130
They tried to missile and it blew up 
that.

1334
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:42,160
But that's how crazy the us has.
And we have historical amnesia where 

1335
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:43,880
americans don't know geography until we 
bombed somewhere.

1336
01:01:43,881 --> 01:01:48,881
Right?
So we have completely no memory about 

1337
01:01:48,881 --> 01:01:51,191
the korean war where theu ,
s military invaded North Korea and 

1338
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:55,340
bombed napalm the fuck out of the 
country for three years.

1339
01:01:55,341 --> 01:02:00,341
Killed Twenty percent of the population 
killed three to 5 million people left 

1340
01:02:00,341 --> 01:02:01,640
the country.
We just completely forgot.

1341
01:02:01,641 --> 01:02:04,160
North koreans haven't forgotten.
They haven't forgotten.

1342
01:02:04,460 --> 01:02:08,240
They have a deep seated hatred for the 
us for a good reason.

1343
01:02:08,530 --> 01:02:09,800
Um,
and americans have no idea.

1344
01:02:09,801 --> 01:02:14,801
We probably don't even know what that we
went to war with Korea that they don't 

1345
01:02:14,801 --> 01:02:15,830
even think about.
Why is there a north and South Korea?

1346
01:02:15,831 --> 01:02:17,870
Like,
what the fuCk is this?

1347
01:02:17,871 --> 01:02:19,500
You know,
it's so kim,

1348
01:02:19,501 --> 01:02:20,310
jon,
uhm,

1349
01:02:20,910 --> 01:02:24,780
obviously probably what he's learned by 
now in terms of us empire,

1350
01:02:24,781 --> 01:02:28,290
imperialism and interventions is that 
you have to not only act like,

1351
01:02:28,291 --> 01:02:30,720
you will use nukes,
like you have to have nukes and you have

1352
01:02:30,721 --> 01:02:32,550
to act like you will use them if you get
attacked,

1353
01:02:32,820 --> 01:02:35,780
unless you want to get invaded.
Look what happened with gaddafi,

1354
01:02:35,790 --> 01:02:37,080
saddam,
all these things.

1355
01:02:37,590 --> 01:02:42,590
Assad,
you give up your chemical weapons and 

1356
01:02:42,590 --> 01:02:42,590
then it doesn't matter.

1357
01:02:42,590 --> 01:02:43,060
Well,
I'm,

1358
01:02:43,070 --> 01:02:48,070
I'm terrified.
I'm terrified of this whole North Korea 

1359
01:02:48,070 --> 01:02:48,390
conflict.
As I think everybody is.

1360
01:02:48,430 --> 01:02:53,430
It's,
it's a terrifying place first of all 

1361
01:02:53,430 --> 01:02:55,431
because it's one of the last really 
obvious military dictatorships in this 

1362
01:02:55,431 --> 01:02:56,310
country,
in the world rather.

1363
01:02:56,610 --> 01:02:59,820
There's not a whole lot of them left,
but that's one of the last one since one

1364
01:02:59,821 --> 01:03:02,090
of the ones that's like,
you can see it.

1365
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:05,250
There are so extreme.
They see them goosestepping walking down

1366
01:03:05,251 --> 01:03:08,790
the street.
You see the people wailing in agony.

1367
01:03:08,791 --> 01:03:10,920
When kim jong il died,
like it's,

1368
01:03:10,950 --> 01:03:14,070
it's a very,
very strange world where people are born

1369
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:17,160
in prison and they live as prisoners 
their whole life.

1370
01:03:17,161 --> 01:03:22,161
And some of them as escaped and detailed
the horrors of the prisons and what's 

1371
01:03:22,351 --> 01:03:25,800
going on with that worries me is because
it won't be hard to sell.

1372
01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:26,640
Exactly.
Yeah.

1373
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:29,250
People already are like,
of course in North Korea is horrible.

1374
01:03:29,251 --> 01:03:31,260
That prison camps,
labor camps is undeniable.

1375
01:03:31,261 --> 01:03:32,040
So like,
yeah,

1376
01:03:32,041 --> 01:03:37,041
I guess we should just do regime change.
That's what I was going to get to is 

1377
01:03:37,041 --> 01:03:37,470
what you had said before the podcast 
started,

1378
01:03:37,770 --> 01:03:42,770
that it's a massive reserve of minerals 
in North Korea and this is what you and 

1379
01:03:42,991 --> 01:03:47,991
I were talking about,
conflict minerals and phones before the 

1380
01:03:47,991 --> 01:03:49,090
podcast started and that they know that 
this,

1381
01:03:49,140 --> 01:03:54,140
by the way also Afghanistan,
trillions of dollars of minute minerals 

1382
01:03:54,140 --> 01:03:55,380
in Afghanistan,
conflict minerals.

1383
01:03:55,530 --> 01:03:56,130
Absolutely.

1384
01:03:57,060 --> 01:03:58,530
We're still fucking there.
To be honest,

1385
01:03:58,531 --> 01:04:01,660
16 years later we dropped that mother of
all bombs that,

1386
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:06,750
that like dick measuring contest that 
trump just laid his dick out on the 

1387
01:04:06,750 --> 01:04:07,370
table and was like,
oh no,

1388
01:04:07,380 --> 01:04:10,320
drop this giant fucking bomb,
dusted off from the shelf.

1389
01:04:10,321 --> 01:04:15,321
It's been sitting there.
Bush wasn't even crazy enough to use it 

1390
01:04:15,321 --> 01:04:15,321
and all of a sudden people are like,
wait,

1391
01:04:15,321 --> 01:04:17,370
we're still in Afghanistan and isis is 
no one.

1392
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:20,340
No one asks any questions.
Why is isis there?

1393
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:21,930
Why are we still in Afghanistan?
Everyone's like,

1394
01:04:21,931 --> 01:04:22,620
oh,
cool.

1395
01:04:23,630 --> 01:04:24,690
Another one.
Let me see.

1396
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:27,240
Let me see the video.
Lindsey graham's like,

1397
01:04:27,241 --> 01:04:29,340
oh cool.
Boom.

1398
01:04:30,270 --> 01:04:31,590
It's disgusting,
dude.

1399
01:04:31,591 --> 01:04:33,960
I mean there was 95,000,
I think 100,000

1400
01:04:33,990 --> 01:04:37,190
people who lived in the and district 
like this was a.

1401
01:04:37,450 --> 01:04:40,500
This wasn't just a mountain region with 
goats.

1402
01:04:40,501 --> 01:04:44,520
I mean there are people there.
The way that afghans are dehumanized and

1403
01:04:44,521 --> 01:04:49,521
the way that the media cheered on the 
Syria strike and this moab thing makes 

1404
01:04:49,521 --> 01:04:54,081
me fucking sick.
Brian williams is sitting up there 

1405
01:04:54,081 --> 01:04:54,081
quoting leonard cohen.
He was like,

1406
01:04:54,081 --> 01:04:56,580
they're beautiful.
The bombs are beautiful.

1407
01:04:56,581 --> 01:04:57,960
He said it to me.
He said,

1408
01:04:57,961 --> 01:05:00,780
I'm bunch of times.
It was amazing in like 30 seconds.

1409
01:05:00,870 --> 01:05:02,460
It was weird.
It was sick.

1410
01:05:02,620 --> 01:05:06,310
It's almost like he's trying to make up 
for the fact that he lied about being in

1411
01:05:06,311 --> 01:05:08,810
that helicopter,
trying really hard to make up for us.

1412
01:05:08,830 --> 01:05:11,610
Like look,
just you just gotta go hardcore,

1413
01:05:11,620 --> 01:05:13,120
right?
Just go all the way.

1414
01:05:13,330 --> 01:05:15,640
Just talk about how beautiful it is.
And it was like.

1415
01:05:15,641 --> 01:05:18,100
And then fareed zakaria here they are 
telling

1416
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:20,890
us that trump is mentally unfit.
Puppet of Russia,

1417
01:05:21,220 --> 01:05:24,660
who's retarded yet the second he starts 
bombing,

1418
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:25,180
it's like,
oh,

1419
01:05:25,181 --> 01:05:26,200
love it.
First strike.

1420
01:05:26,201 --> 01:05:28,420
Like he started bombing assad now.
We all love him.

1421
01:05:28,570 --> 01:05:32,560
Rachel maddow has been talking the last 
30 days or three months,

1422
01:05:32,561 --> 01:05:34,780
six months about how he needs to be 
impeached.

1423
01:05:34,781 --> 01:05:37,300
He's guided by putin and then the second
he started bombing Syria.

1424
01:05:37,420 --> 01:05:42,420
Oh,
it becomes a commercial for tomahawk 

1425
01:05:42,420 --> 01:05:44,041
missiles.
Rachel maddow did a 30 minute segment 

1426
01:05:44,041 --> 01:05:44,110
just analyzing how efficient tomahawk 
missiles are.

1427
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:45,490
Well,
great.

1428
01:05:45,550 --> 01:05:46,630
Why do you think she did that?

1429
01:05:47,420 --> 01:05:52,420
I think that the.
There's a bipartisan establishment 

1430
01:05:52,420 --> 01:05:53,690
consensus on foreign policy and there 
has been.

1431
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:56,270
This is the empire,
does the corporate media.

1432
01:05:56,360 --> 01:06:00,620
I'm completely loves the empire.
They love imperialism,

1433
01:06:00,621 --> 01:06:03,410
they love selling wars.
They have for a long time,

1434
01:06:03,411 --> 01:06:04,700
joe.
That's how I became a journalist because

1435
01:06:04,701 --> 01:06:09,701
I saw the Iraq war been sold by quote 
leftists are liberals on tv and I just 

1436
01:06:10,011 --> 01:06:13,040
couldn't understand why they were 
selling a completely insane,

1437
01:06:13,041 --> 01:06:14,900
unnecessarily illegal war where there 
was a lot of it.

1438
01:06:14,910 --> 01:06:19,910
well,
there were selling it or at least in 

1439
01:06:19,910 --> 01:06:20,190
support of it because we were really 
terrified after nine slash 11,

1440
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:25,360
so after nine slash 11,
there was this movement to do something 

1441
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:28,880
and this massive amount of people that 
ordinarily would have a lot of distrust 

1442
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:34,160
towards the right.
They all of a sudden we're trusting in 

1443
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:36,770
bush and trusting in the government to 
go and out adequate job.

1444
01:06:37,490 --> 01:06:39,680
So it'd be a stenographer because you're
scared.

1445
01:06:39,710 --> 01:06:41,510
That's like the time that you're 
supposed to step up and say,

1446
01:06:41,511 --> 01:06:46,511
okay,
I need to question my government's 

1447
01:06:46,511 --> 01:06:47,420
claims because we're in such a state of 
hysteria and acquiescence that I need to

1448
01:06:47,750 --> 01:06:52,750
as a journalist.
QuesTion authority question my 

1449
01:06:52,750 --> 01:06:52,750
government.
That's the number one job that you have.

1450
01:06:52,750 --> 01:06:54,050
What was your thought?
How old will.

1451
01:06:54,051 --> 01:06:55,250
You're not old enough,
really?

1452
01:06:55,251 --> 01:06:57,440
How old were you at September 11th.
Oh yeah,

1453
01:06:57,441 --> 01:06:58,400
no,
I was 18,

1454
01:06:58,401 --> 01:07:00,590
so I was.
What did you have any.

1455
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:03,290
Obviously when you're 18 it's hard to 
formulate.

1456
01:07:03,660 --> 01:07:04,320
Yeah,
no,

1457
01:07:04,321 --> 01:07:07,080
I'm my eye.
I was stunned.

1458
01:07:07,081 --> 01:07:10,170
I mean I agreed with the Afghanistan war
at the time beCause I didn't really know

1459
01:07:10,171 --> 01:07:15,171
and then I went into college and learned
about what the fuck this government and 

1460
01:07:15,171 --> 01:07:16,320
country has been doing to the rest of 
the world and what militarism and empire

1461
01:07:16,321 --> 01:07:18,450
has been doing.
So I kind of put it together and then.

1462
01:07:18,451 --> 01:07:23,451
But that was just Afghanistan.
I really woke up when one day my mom 

1463
01:07:23,451 --> 01:07:24,540
called me and she was like,
did saddam bama us?

1464
01:07:25,140 --> 01:07:30,140
She said because every single media 
outlet has just switched over from 

1465
01:07:30,140 --> 01:07:30,840
Afghanistan to Iraq unquestioningly.

1466
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:36,160
So do you think that like rachel maddow 
for me always seems like if there's 

1467
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:40,421
anybody that's not toeing the line,
it's that lesbian but it doesn't seem 

1468
01:07:40,701 --> 01:07:42,070
like she would be like,
I like,

1469
01:07:42,370 --> 01:07:46,910
she'd be like the perfect person to sell
you some shit that you know,

1470
01:07:46,911 --> 01:07:50,840
like you would never buy as a person on 
the left because she's like,

1471
01:07:50,990 --> 01:07:55,130
she's super articulate.
She's wicked sMart and she's obviously a

1472
01:07:55,131 --> 01:07:58,550
lesbian and she's got short hair and she
hated trump,

1473
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:02,060
so like if you wanted to sell something,
she's your huckleberry

1474
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:04,670
and she was trying to sell that Russia 
shit real hard.

1475
01:08:04,671 --> 01:08:09,671
I mean she talked more about Russia than
any other issue and that's the Problem 

1476
01:08:09,671 --> 01:08:12,941
with this so called resistance is that 
when you focus on a fake issue like 

1477
01:08:12,941 --> 01:08:15,980
Russia usurping trump's brain or like 
and trump's and puppeting

1478
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:18,050
him,
then you forget about all the rapid fire

1479
01:08:18,051 --> 01:08:23,051
executive orders he's throwing down you.
You aren't focusing on the real 

1480
01:08:23,051 --> 01:08:27,131
important things that he's doing that we
could actually galvanize and stop and 

1481
01:08:27,131 --> 01:08:28,160
especially when you're just pro war,
these motherfuckers are,

1482
01:08:28,460 --> 01:08:30,350
they're funded by defense contractors in
banks.

1483
01:08:30,351 --> 01:08:33,650
That's what the corporate media is.
That's what the corporate media is.

1484
01:08:33,670 --> 01:08:37,970
She knows gone all in that.
It's been like a coup against Russia.

1485
01:08:38,210 --> 01:08:40,610
What's homeboy's name that used to be on
espn?

1486
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:41,600
The fuck.
Oh my god.

1487
01:08:41,601 --> 01:08:43,370
Keith olbermann.
The reason you saw,

1488
01:08:43,580 --> 01:08:48,380
did you see the kermit the frog where 
he's like covered in the american flag?

1489
01:08:48,381 --> 01:08:50,800
Did you see that crazy way?
We should look that way.

1490
01:08:50,900 --> 01:08:55,900
He's got a whole thing.
It looks like he's in a basement 

1491
01:08:55,900 --> 01:08:57,420
somewhere.
Nicer resistance.

1492
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:59,930
Sponsored by gq.
What is going on with him?

1493
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:04,960
does he have children?
I don't know what the hell is going on 

1494
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:04,960
with the kids.

1495
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:05,600
I used to.
I used to really,

1496
01:09:05,601 --> 01:09:07,520
really like him.
Psychologically.

1497
01:09:07,521 --> 01:09:12,521
I used to as well.
I used to think that he had some 

1498
01:09:12,521 --> 01:09:14,531
interesting rants.
The problem is too many people liked it 

1499
01:09:14,531 --> 01:09:16,610
and then he like got drunk with it seems
like now he's,

1500
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:19,420
he's his,
his speeches are,

1501
01:09:19,470 --> 01:09:23,780
they're almost like a parody of a guy 
who is.

1502
01:09:23,870 --> 01:09:28,870
It's almost likE an old Christian Slater
movie about a guy who's got like some 

1503
01:09:28,870 --> 01:09:33,041
sort of a ham radio thing and he's 
fighting against the oppressive 

1504
01:09:33,041 --> 01:09:33,230
government.
It's really,

1505
01:09:33,231 --> 01:09:35,120
really hurt tuna fish.
Yes.

1506
01:09:35,230 --> 01:09:37,830
cartoonish is the right word.
Really weird.

1507
01:09:37,900 --> 01:09:42,900
I saw this one like side by side,
meme of him draPed in the american flag 

1508
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:43,280
and he's like this,
you know,

1509
01:09:43,281 --> 01:09:45,970
on the cover of gq.
And then someone put kermit the frog,

1510
01:09:45,980 --> 01:09:50,980
like draped in a magazine.
This is what keith olbermann thinks he 

1511
01:09:50,980 --> 01:09:50,980
looks like and this is what he really 
looks like and it was just like a little

1512
01:09:50,980 --> 01:09:52,730
frog into.
It's just nuts.

1513
01:09:52,731 --> 01:09:54,900
I mean,
what the hell is this guy doing and how,

1514
01:09:54,950 --> 01:09:59,950
what is gq doing?
IT's like you have teen vogue somehow 

1515
01:09:59,950 --> 01:10:02,390
leading the resistance and like what the
fuck country.

1516
01:10:04,980 --> 01:10:08,730
His videos are so strange.
There's so verBose and it's like,

1517
01:10:09,030 --> 01:10:09,670
damn,
that dude.

1518
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:11,530
Is this a first draft?
It's like,

1519
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:17,000
it is.
It seems like you've got a lot of extra 

1520
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:17,000
words in there.
We could,

1521
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:17,420
you could trim that down a little bit 
and have a little more impact.

1522
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:22,720
But I wait,
I wrote this down because I wanted to 

1523
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:23,020
say this.
This is insane.

1524
01:10:23,070 --> 01:10:25,010
So the pentagon just came out with a 
number.

1525
01:10:25,940 --> 01:10:30,940
It said 70,000
people have been killed as a result of 

1526
01:10:30,940 --> 01:10:31,130
bombing Syria in Iraq since 2014.
You're like,

1527
01:10:31,131 --> 01:10:32,330
okay,
that's crazy.

1528
01:10:32,590 --> 01:10:34,520
Um,
they said they called the militants.

1529
01:10:34,521 --> 01:10:37,370
We already know that militant can be 
just a military age males.

1530
01:10:37,371 --> 01:10:41,530
So really they include the libyan 
militant feminist feminists.

1531
01:10:41,750 --> 01:10:43,810
You can build short hair,
you know,

1532
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,140
lesbian on the,
on the ground and they think they were a

1533
01:10:46,141 --> 01:10:51,141
man.
So They include like anyone who's 

1534
01:10:51,141 --> 01:10:52,100
probably over the age of 10 and a male 
as a militant.

1535
01:10:52,101 --> 01:10:54,500
So anyway,
these numbers are 70,000

1536
01:10:54,501 --> 01:10:59,501
people are killed.
And then they said only 229 civilians 

1537
01:10:59,990 --> 01:11:02,120
were killed.
So 70,000

1538
01:11:02,121 --> 01:11:04,370
militants,
229 civilians.

1539
01:11:04,371 --> 01:11:07,820
Here's another interesting part.
The cia in 2014,

1540
01:11:07,821 --> 01:11:10,490
estimated that there are only between 30
to 40,000

1541
01:11:10,491 --> 01:11:13,230
isis fighters in Syria and Iraq.
So are The.

1542
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:14,190
So I'm sorry,

1543
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:19,520
what the fuck did these other 30,000
people come from and did you kill all 

1544
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:22,581
isis?
Like all isis has gone somehow their 

1545
01:11:22,581 --> 01:11:23,930
back because they're still staring.
What year was the estimate?

1546
01:11:23,980 --> 01:11:27,270
Two thousand 14 is when they said there 
were probably 30 to 40,000

1547
01:11:27,390 --> 01:11:30,820
and then the pentagon just came out and 
this is according to the la times 70,000

1548
01:11:30,890 --> 01:11:34,020
militants killed since 2014.
Only tWo hundred civilians.

1549
01:11:34,050 --> 01:11:35,550
Don't worry about it.
Wow.

1550
01:11:35,551 --> 01:11:39,240
That makes me feel really good.
I've never seen one tear.

1551
01:11:39,450 --> 01:11:42,540
I feel pretty good.
Just killing a bunch of terrorists.

1552
01:11:42,780 --> 01:11:44,370
Wow.
THat's nuts.

1553
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:45,870
Yeah.
No one questions.

1554
01:11:45,871 --> 01:11:47,450
This shit man.
It's sick.

1555
01:11:48,190 --> 01:11:49,890
You will.
I watch house of cards,

1556
01:11:49,950 --> 01:11:52,830
so I have a really good grasp of the 
political system.

1557
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:56,250
Is the new sis a season out yet?
Not yet.

1558
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:57,530
Next month.
I'm still on the.

1559
01:11:57,630 --> 01:11:59,490
I just started.
I just started this year,

1560
01:11:59,491 --> 01:12:00,840
so yeah,
I binge watched.

1561
01:12:01,260 --> 01:12:04,260
I went from the 2012 episodes all the 
way to.

1562
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:07,100
I'm on season four right now.
God damn it.

1563
01:12:07,300 --> 01:12:12,300
I was watching when it became really 
like all about the potent character 

1564
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:16,340
because you know,
first frank underwood's like he kills 

1565
01:12:16,340 --> 01:12:16,340
the journal.

1566
01:12:21,140 --> 01:12:22,260
Robin white.
They're bitches.

1567
01:12:22,261 --> 01:12:24,070
Bad ass though.
I'll tell you why she.

1568
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:26,640
She directs some of the best episodes to
really?

1569
01:12:26,641 --> 01:12:27,600
Yeah.
Yeah.

1570
01:12:27,630 --> 01:12:29,070
She directed.
When I watched last night,

1571
01:12:29,071 --> 01:12:30,050
I was like,
jesus,

1572
01:12:30,410 --> 01:12:34,370
creepy camera angles and they remind me 
of the clintons.

1573
01:12:34,830 --> 01:12:36,330
Oh,
for sure.

1574
01:12:37,090 --> 01:12:38,710
I thought it should be.
I thought it should be.

1575
01:12:38,711 --> 01:12:41,190
It should have been illegal for hillary 
to even run.

1576
01:12:41,310 --> 01:12:42,620
Yeah,
because I,

1577
01:12:42,621 --> 01:12:45,090
I look at them as a unit just like the 
underwoods,

1578
01:12:45,150 --> 01:12:50,150
you know,
and they work together where clinton 

1579
01:12:50,150 --> 01:12:52,071
even admitted that hillary was the one 
who sold the yugoslavia bombing and 

1580
01:12:52,071 --> 01:12:52,071
stuff and she even said,
she was like,

1581
01:12:52,071 --> 01:12:53,970
I'm an appoint build to run the economy.
It's like again,

1582
01:12:54,850 --> 01:12:57,660
destroyed the economy back in the 
nineties.

1583
01:12:57,661 --> 01:13:01,230
How is this legal?
My favorite footage of her of all time,

1584
01:13:01,260 --> 01:13:06,180
where you really got to See behind the 
wizard's curtain was when kadafi died.

1585
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:11,240
That was sick when she was literally 
back her head laughing,

1586
01:13:11,431 --> 01:13:12,690
going,
we came,

1587
01:13:12,691 --> 01:13:17,691
we saw he died after he was raped by a 
bayonet from the rebels that we funded 

1588
01:13:18,030 --> 01:13:22,200
and you could watch it like you could 
see stabbed in the asshole.

1589
01:13:22,620 --> 01:13:27,620
You can watch him,
you could watch him terrified and he 

1590
01:13:27,620 --> 01:13:29,020
doesn't even react.
He's so fucked up.

1591
01:13:30,780 --> 01:13:32,460
And then they're shooting them and 
killing them.

1592
01:13:32,461 --> 01:13:35,400
They tried them around his dead body.
It's fucked up.

1593
01:13:35,401 --> 01:13:38,790
But watching that guy shoved that band 
at up to up his ass.

1594
01:13:38,820 --> 01:13:39,780
It's like,
whoa.

1595
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:41,460
And what was the premIse of the Libya 
thing?

1596
01:13:41,461 --> 01:13:46,461
Now it's a completely failed state.
Isis has totally taken over the country 

1597
01:13:46,461 --> 01:13:49,941
and where all the interventionists that 
were cheering on the Libya bombing and 

1598
01:13:49,941 --> 01:13:53,631
they all said gaddafi was on the verge 
of committing to massacre and ben gazi 

1599
01:13:53,631 --> 01:13:53,631
and we have to go in.

1600
01:13:53,631 --> 01:13:55,020
We have to do the no fly zone.
Where all these people now.

1601
01:13:55,021 --> 01:13:56,820
Where are these cheerleaders now?
Yeah,

1602
01:13:56,830 --> 01:14:00,840
just kind of a twitter message argument 
in Syria from a guy who lives in Libya.

1603
01:14:01,410 --> 01:14:03,300
It was pretty deep.
What did he say?

1604
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:05,670
Just terrified.
He wants to talk about it.

1605
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:11,400
Just would love to be a guest on the 
podcast to the.

1606
01:14:11,710 --> 01:14:16,710
I think the.
The idea that you're going to remove a 

1607
01:14:16,710 --> 01:14:19,921
dictator and then everything's going to 
be fun is so crazy and so it's never 

1608
01:14:20,201 --> 01:14:22,450
worked ever.
It'll work in Syria.

1609
01:14:23,490 --> 01:14:26,110
How navy.
What do you do?

1610
01:14:26,111 --> 01:14:29,890
Like what do you do?
If I can fucking do anything you to lead

1611
01:14:29,891 --> 01:14:33,130
those people suffer when the police 
officers of the world,

1612
01:14:33,370 --> 01:14:37,000
when has any humanitarian intervention 
resulteD in anything?

1613
01:14:37,001 --> 01:14:38,350
Good.
can you tell me?

1614
01:14:38,351 --> 01:14:43,351
That's a good question.
It's always killed more people than 

1615
01:14:43,351 --> 01:14:43,351
we're trying to save.

1616
01:14:43,351 --> 01:14:47,250
Well,
trump bombed Syria because kids were 

1617
01:14:47,250 --> 01:14:47,650
gassed and in the meantime killed kids 
when he was bombing them.

1618
01:14:48,370 --> 01:14:52,960
Germany now makes great cars and they 
used to make nazis.

1619
01:14:54,890 --> 01:14:59,290
So have you heard the norm mcdonald?
A bit about.

1620
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:00,400
Oh man,
he has the best.

1621
01:15:00,401 --> 01:15:02,030
Like nazi jokes.
No.

1622
01:15:02,650 --> 01:15:07,650
So good.
It was so crazy to have all the head of 

1623
01:15:07,650 --> 01:15:07,720
all the comedians.
He really pulls it off.

1624
01:15:07,750 --> 01:15:09,820
What is a duty?
We have to watch it.

1625
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,250
What is it that there's a reason?
I mean,

1626
01:15:12,251 --> 01:15:15,700
he's done a million.
Norm is so crazy.

1627
01:15:15,701 --> 01:15:17,710
Nuts.
He's such a character.

1628
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:23,160
He's so great.
he's always wearing like a letterman 

1629
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:23,160
jacket and it's like,
what the nuts.

1630
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:25,420
That's who he is to,
you know,

1631
01:15:25,421 --> 01:15:26,710
he doesn't,
he doesn't even drive.

1632
01:15:27,670 --> 01:15:29,050
Oh yeah.
He's scared of driving.

1633
01:15:29,370 --> 01:15:32,710
So weird.
I flew with him randomly twice.

1634
01:15:33,100 --> 01:15:38,100
Just randomly.
Just like totally total dumb luck on two

1635
01:15:39,131 --> 01:15:42,190
separate occasions as norm set right 
next to me and he's like a tree.

1636
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:44,390
Can't believe this is happening.
Yeah,

1637
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:46,450
it was.
The last one was hilarious.

1638
01:15:46,630 --> 01:15:51,630
We have this long conversation.
We having a great old time and he's 

1639
01:15:51,630 --> 01:15:51,630
telling me,
yeah,

1640
01:15:51,630 --> 01:15:53,050
I quit smoking,
I don't like to smoke anymore.

1641
01:15:53,051 --> 01:15:55,120
It's just terrible.
So hard to quit,

1642
01:15:55,121 --> 01:16:00,121
but I'm glad it did.
We land and he immediately walks right 

1643
01:16:00,121 --> 01:16:01,780
into a gift shop or buy cigarettes,
so I changed my mind.

1644
01:16:01,781 --> 01:16:05,410
I want to start smoking again and he's 
lighting before he gets out the door,

1645
01:16:05,411 --> 01:16:09,460
but he's so impulsive.
He's like walking towards doing.

1646
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:10,350
I'm like,
whoa,

1647
01:16:10,351 --> 01:16:11,260
like norm,
what are you doing?

1648
01:16:11,261 --> 01:16:11,680
He goes,
yeah,

1649
01:16:11,681 --> 01:16:12,810
I guess I smoke again.

1650
01:16:17,470 --> 01:16:20,530
There's people out there that are like 
pretending to be wacky.

1651
01:16:20,770 --> 01:16:22,180
Right.
He's really wacky.

1652
01:16:22,210 --> 01:16:23,670
I love those people.
There's so.

1653
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:26,860
There's so few of them who are just 
themselves like no matter what,

1654
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:30,580
just that's who norman is.
He's great and he's so funny.

1655
01:16:30,700 --> 01:16:32,530
David cross's new specials.
Really good.

1656
01:16:32,531 --> 01:16:33,250
Actually,
it's not new.

1657
01:16:33,251 --> 01:16:36,730
It was before trump got elected,
but it's hysterical.

1658
01:16:36,731 --> 01:16:40,630
His stuff on gun control is really,
really funny and he's doing it to like a

1659
01:16:40,631 --> 01:16:45,631
houston audience where it's a lot of 
trump supporters and he just goes balls 

1660
01:16:45,631 --> 01:16:45,631
to the wall,
like everyone's walking out.

1661
01:16:45,631 --> 01:16:47,170
Really just.
Yeah,

1662
01:16:47,230 --> 01:16:52,230
it's nuts.
Houston is a strange place because it's 

1663
01:16:52,230 --> 01:16:52,230
all.
There's a lot of liberals in houston,

1664
01:16:52,230 --> 01:16:55,470
a lot more than houston is way more 
diversified than it gets credit for.

1665
01:16:56,060 --> 01:16:58,660
It's a very interesting city.
It's very interesting.

1666
01:16:58,661 --> 01:17:00,210
I feel like dallas,
austin,

1667
01:17:01,390 --> 01:17:05,920
austin is the super lefty part.
That's the most lefty part of Texas,

1668
01:17:06,340 --> 01:17:09,260
but houston is way more cut down the 
middle.

1669
01:17:09,261 --> 01:17:10,010
It's almost like it's a

1670
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:14,510
split of austin and dallas and it's like
you got the cool.

1671
01:17:14,890 --> 01:17:15,500
Yeah.
You got.

1672
01:17:15,620 --> 01:17:19,430
I love houston.
You got austin left dallas pretty right,

1673
01:17:19,670 --> 01:17:24,670
and then you've got houston,
which is like a combo plate bit.

1674
01:17:25,270 --> 01:17:26,030
I mean,
do you have any.

1675
01:17:26,031 --> 01:17:31,031
Trump will get mad.
People fucking attacked him and I made 

1676
01:17:31,031 --> 01:17:32,620
videos of people getting attacked for 
st.

1677
01:17:33,160 --> 01:17:35,600
How are you not making fun of trump?
It's Donald Trump.

1678
01:17:36,170 --> 01:17:37,010
Well,
they'll get it.

1679
01:17:37,220 --> 01:17:39,710
They'll get it.
Eventually it will take a little time.

1680
01:17:39,770 --> 01:17:42,110
I mean when there's no way.
Snowflakes.

1681
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:47,200
Yeah.
There's no way this is going to keep 

1682
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:47,310
going and be good.
It's just.

1683
01:17:47,450 --> 01:17:49,310
I really think,
and this is what I think,

1684
01:17:49,311 --> 01:17:54,311
and I don't think this is necessarily a 
reflection of who Donald Trump is or I 

1685
01:17:54,311 --> 01:17:57,530
just think the idea of a president is 
preposterous.

1686
01:17:57,860 --> 01:18:02,860
The idea of one person that has that 
much power over hundreds of millions of 

1687
01:18:03,381 --> 01:18:04,700
people is insane.

1688
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:10,060
It's an idea that was created back when 
people rode horses and roping with 

1689
01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:10,550
feathers.
They used to.

1690
01:18:10,610 --> 01:18:12,380
They used to fucking.
I mean,

1691
01:18:12,381 --> 01:18:13,690
that's really what it was.
I mean,

1692
01:18:13,700 --> 01:18:18,700
the whole representative government,
you have a representative government 

1693
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:21,561
because some people lived in North 
Dakota and how the fuck would you get 

1694
01:18:21,561 --> 01:18:21,561
worried to Washington?
Well,

1695
01:18:21,561 --> 01:18:21,680
you had to have somebody talking for 
you.

1696
01:18:21,860 --> 01:18:23,450
Well now you can send an email.
You fuck.

1697
01:18:23,540 --> 01:18:26,240
You could vote online.
The idea is antiquated.

1698
01:18:26,420 --> 01:18:30,920
It's so behind the times and it's so 
behind the times to have one person have

1699
01:18:30,921 --> 01:18:35,921
any sort of massive power and also I 
feel like the government works very hard

1700
01:18:37,671 --> 01:18:42,671
to stop monopolies in certain sectors.
Why don't they work so hard to stop it 

1701
01:18:42,671 --> 01:18:45,260
in government because this left versus 
right.

1702
01:18:45,270 --> 01:18:48,560
This republican versus democrat thing is
a goddamn ruse.

1703
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:51,380
Appropriations police themselves,
great question.

1704
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:52,210
It's people.

1705
01:18:52,210 --> 01:18:55,400
It's like I think scholars,
educators,

1706
01:18:55,460 --> 01:19:00,460
people who actually understand the 
consequences of these ideological 

1707
01:19:00,460 --> 01:19:02,330
structures that were trapped in these,
these,

1708
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:07,360
these are structures left versus right 
as a structure because they provide you 

1709
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:12,131
with a predetermined pattern or behavior
that you adopt and there's many,

1710
01:19:12,201 --> 01:19:15,910
many easily influenced people that go 
super hardcore,

1711
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:20,920
right or super hardcore left because 
they want social brownie points within 

1712
01:19:21,201 --> 01:19:24,160
the structure and that's a natural part 
of being a human.

1713
01:19:24,170 --> 01:19:28,820
It's a natural part of tribal behavior 
and it has to be addressed and it has to

1714
01:19:28,821 --> 01:19:33,821
be addressed openly and it has to be 
addressed from a an understanding of 

1715
01:19:33,821 --> 01:19:38,351
fundamental understanding about a way 
the human mind works and the way the 

1716
01:19:38,351 --> 01:19:40,790
human psychology works and our need for 
social acceptance works.

1717
01:19:41,030 --> 01:19:46,030
There's a lot of the way we behave 
that's just based on and predicated on 

1718
01:19:46,030 --> 01:19:48,620
these really simple,
obvious principles that everybody knows.

1719
01:19:48,621 --> 01:19:51,350
Peer pressure,
the desire to be loved.

1720
01:19:51,380 --> 01:19:56,380
Those things all play a massive part in 
how you're manipulated and how you 

1721
01:19:56,380 --> 01:19:59,600
manipulate yourself.
You convince yourself of certain things.

1722
01:19:59,601 --> 01:20:03,470
I really firmly believe that when you go
super hard,

1723
01:20:03,471 --> 01:20:08,471
right and super hard left,
the distance between these two is not 

1724
01:20:08,471 --> 01:20:08,471
nearly

1725
01:20:08,471 --> 01:20:13,020
as far as you think and that the 
ideological point of views than the what

1726
01:20:13,021 --> 01:20:16,440
they want and what they're trying to 
accomplish is very different,

1727
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:21,680
but the way they think,
the way they've locked themselves into 

1728
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:25,680
these predetermined thought patterns,
they're not much different.

1729
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:30,920
They're just were indoctrinated one way 
or indoctrinated or another way they 

1730
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:33,210
might have gone through the church 
system or they might've gone through the

1731
01:20:33,211 --> 01:20:38,211
university system,
but they've sort of both taken these 

1732
01:20:38,211 --> 01:20:41,721
hard line stances.
Whereas the reality of the world and 

1733
01:20:41,721 --> 01:20:45,531
have most reasonable people is there's a
lot of weirdness and there's a lot of 

1734
01:20:46,170 --> 01:20:49,260
variables to be considered in.
Most people are not hard.

1735
01:20:49,261 --> 01:20:54,261
Right and most people are not hard left 
theirs and you have to take one or the 

1736
01:20:54,261 --> 01:20:58,701
other and it's really the best way is 
probably a gigantic group that gets to 

1737
01:21:02,071 --> 01:21:05,400
decide on all sorts of different things 
and many,

1738
01:21:05,401 --> 01:21:07,120
many different parties to choose from.

1739
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:12,120
Like I think holland has something like 
don't they have like 16 different 

1740
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:16,461
political parties or something that we 
have this two party dictatorship and I 

1741
01:21:16,461 --> 01:21:18,420
was reading this quote from chris hedges
that really says it all.

1742
01:21:18,421 --> 01:21:20,730
It's like exactly what you're saying 
right now.

1743
01:21:20,731 --> 01:21:25,731
You have conservatives across the 
country who are worried about abortion 

1744
01:21:25,731 --> 01:21:30,351
and obsessing about these issues and 
then you have the liberals in New York 

1745
01:21:30,351 --> 01:21:30,351
who are obsessing about creationism in 
schools.

1746
01:21:30,351 --> 01:21:32,180
Meanwhile,
goldman sachs continues to fucking win.

1747
01:21:32,280 --> 01:21:37,280
Yeah.
It doesn't matter what you guys are 

1748
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:37,280
squabbling about on the ground,
left,

1749
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:37,860
right?
Liberal,

1750
01:21:37,861 --> 01:21:42,861
conservative,
like these people are in power and 

1751
01:21:42,861 --> 01:21:42,861
they're going to further entrench their 
power.

1752
01:21:42,861 --> 01:21:44,740
We're all the losers here and it's.
Yeah,

1753
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:49,760
like you were just saying.
I mean why do we have a system that 

1754
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:50,220
props up these two parties that going 
back to the corporate media,

1755
01:21:50,250 --> 01:21:55,250
continues to sell war after war 
continues to just sell off our 

1756
01:21:55,250 --> 01:21:55,770
government to corporations.

1757
01:21:55,980 --> 01:21:59,540
It's just the matter of which they do so
well.

1758
01:21:59,550 --> 01:22:04,550
Control of groups.
Anytime you have one person or one 

1759
01:22:04,550 --> 01:22:06,360
organization that has control over a 
group,

1760
01:22:06,361 --> 01:22:08,490
whether it's a dictatorship,
whether it's a government,

1761
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,880
so like what,
what is a government for?

1762
01:22:11,940 --> 01:22:16,940
is it to control groups of people or is 
it to provide people with services like 

1763
01:22:17,221 --> 01:22:22,221
schools and utilities and infrastructure
that should be like really what it is 

1764
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:26,640
and the idea that war is an extra bowl.
It's an extra bowl.

1765
01:22:26,641 --> 01:22:28,840
You can't remove it from our culture.
You cannot.

1766
01:22:28,841 --> 01:22:33,841
I mean if you ask people,
do you envision a time in your life or 

1767
01:22:33,841 --> 01:22:34,020
war doesn't exist?
No one says yes,

1768
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:37,350
but yet sad is it's crazy.
It's crazy.

1769
01:22:37,830 --> 01:22:39,990
We just live in a war economy or that's 
just a necessity.

1770
01:22:39,991 --> 01:22:40,320
It's like,
well,

1771
01:22:40,321 --> 01:22:42,140
we have to have just endless war.
Right?

1772
01:22:42,150 --> 01:22:42,810
What is that?

1773
01:22:42,810 --> 01:22:47,610
Is that the disconnection between human 
beings based on financial,

1774
01:22:48,540 --> 01:22:50,610
financial situations,
based on language,

1775
01:22:50,611 --> 01:22:52,200
based on culture,
based on religion,

1776
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:57,500
like all these differences are so vast 
that we have to launch bombs out of 

1777
01:22:57,500 --> 01:23:01,131
planes.
I mean it's an indoctrination of 

1778
01:23:01,131 --> 01:23:03,651
american exceptionalism.
going back to the historical amnesia 

1779
01:23:03,651 --> 01:23:03,780
about what this government has done.
The rest of the world hasn't forgotten.

1780
01:23:03,781 --> 01:23:08,560
The rest of the world is very acutely 
aware of what the empire does on a daily

1781
01:23:08,561 --> 01:23:10,180
basis.
We have no idea.

1782
01:23:10,270 --> 01:23:11,500
Right.
But it's every country.

1783
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:16,800
I mean it's every country with the 
military tries to enforce that military 

1784
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:18,520
in some way,
shape or form on other countries.

1785
01:23:18,610 --> 01:23:23,080
I mean it's just,
it's gone on since the beginning of time

1786
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:28,440
as far as people getting together in 
groups and then going over and 

1787
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:28,810
conquering other people that have 
resources.

1788
01:23:28,850 --> 01:23:29,950
Well,
some people would say it's the,

1789
01:23:29,951 --> 01:23:34,951
it's the system,
the economic system that once you 

1790
01:23:34,951 --> 01:23:38,460
control one area,
you have to move capital and it and 

1791
01:23:38,460 --> 01:23:38,500
extract capital from other areas through
force,

1792
01:23:38,501 --> 01:23:43,501
through military force,
and that's the extension of imperialism 

1793
01:23:43,501 --> 01:23:43,501
through capitalism.

1794
01:23:43,501 --> 01:23:44,470
And then so you just go and now we're 
the biggest,

1795
01:23:44,471 --> 01:23:49,090
most powerful empire controlling the 
entire world and we have to go after the

1796
01:23:49,091 --> 01:23:53,890
last remaining sovereign quote unquote 
sovereign states to completely control.

1797
01:23:53,891 --> 01:23:54,520
I mean,
yes,

1798
01:23:54,760 --> 01:23:59,760
other countries have done that before,
but never on the level of what we're 

1799
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:03,151
doing.
If we could just get everybody to speak 

1800
01:24:03,151 --> 01:24:03,151
english and everybody to listen to us,
we will be fine.

1801
01:24:03,700 --> 01:24:08,700
We need to do is wipe out all the other 
cultures when you use a wipe wipe out 

1802
01:24:08,951 --> 01:24:11,640
all of them.
We need cultural marxism.

1803
01:24:11,830 --> 01:24:15,040
We just need a dictatorship.
A one trump world.

1804
01:24:15,370 --> 01:24:17,170
I was going to ask you,
how do you feel about the.

1805
01:24:17,260 --> 01:24:22,260
I feel like the level of discourse has 
gotten to the point back to the 

1806
01:24:22,260 --> 01:24:22,690
reactionary thing someone was telling me
this last night,

1807
01:24:22,810 --> 01:24:26,090
that the word responsibility,
it's like you know,

1808
01:24:26,290 --> 01:24:31,290
your ability to respond,
the ability to understand a situation 

1809
01:24:31,290 --> 01:24:34,951
responded,
not just react and I feel like so much 

1810
01:24:34,951 --> 01:24:36,110
of our culture is just reacting to news 
without even understanding what the hell

1811
01:24:36,111 --> 01:24:36,730
is going on.

1812
01:24:36,730 --> 01:24:41,730
You know the,
the twitter universe where it's just 

1813
01:24:41,730 --> 01:24:41,730
like you'd see something and you react 
and what?

1814
01:24:41,730 --> 01:24:46,690
What does that do to critical thinking?
What does that do to discourse when you 

1815
01:24:46,690 --> 01:24:50,260
do not understand issues or have the 
ability to respond that responsibility?

1816
01:24:50,620 --> 01:24:51,180
Well,
not only that,

1817
01:24:51,181 --> 01:24:54,400
you be aged and dated by so much data.
If you look at something,

1818
01:24:54,401 --> 01:24:56,350
you're looking at a headline really 
quick.

1819
01:24:57,160 --> 01:25:01,060
So many people have no idea what the 
article even says like we did like I did

1820
01:25:01,160 --> 01:25:06,160
about that epa or you want me to hear 
that shit and you could be at a gas 

1821
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:10,681
station right now talking to her friend.
Remember that fucking government for 

1822
01:25:10,681 --> 01:25:14,430
shutting down database with the epa 
can't even get a hold of the 

1823
01:25:14,430 --> 01:25:14,430
information.
That's it's crazy.

1824
01:25:14,430 --> 01:25:15,790
We got to organize mean while you're not
even reading.

1825
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:18,160
I didn't read it.
I just told you about it.

1826
01:25:18,220 --> 01:25:23,220
I had jamie pull it up and then we found
out if it wasn't for jamie pulling it 

1827
01:25:23,220 --> 01:25:26,791
up,
I would probably pair it out for a 

1828
01:25:26,791 --> 01:25:26,791
couple of days.
Something would have had to.

1829
01:25:26,791 --> 01:25:27,820
Somebody would have had to tell me on 
twitter,

1830
01:25:27,821 --> 01:25:28,720
hey matt,
it's a hoax.

1831
01:25:28,750 --> 01:25:31,750
I would have.
Otherwise she tweeted it,

1832
01:25:31,780 --> 01:25:32,800
shit,
it's a hoax.

1833
01:25:36,250 --> 01:25:38,180
There's too much coming at us.
Abby.

1834
01:25:38,250 --> 01:25:40,480
It was too much.
We can't handle it.

1835
01:25:41,210 --> 01:25:44,170
It's totally true.
It's too much info and totally true.

1836
01:25:44,180 --> 01:25:49,180
It's part of the whole thing with the 
internet is like these little 140 

1837
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:50,560
characters.
Sound bites,

1838
01:25:50,561 --> 01:25:55,561
you getting off twitter,
but then the fact that it's coming at 

1839
01:25:55,561 --> 01:25:56,110
you from websites,
it's coming at you from facebook,

1840
01:25:56,111 --> 01:26:01,111
it's coming at you from instagram.
It's just coming at you in a way that 

1841
01:26:01,111 --> 01:26:01,480
like there's no fucking way you can keep
up with all this.

1842
01:26:01,540 --> 01:26:04,130
There's no way,
and that's part of what's going

1843
01:26:04,130 --> 01:26:06,330
on with people.
Absolutely,

1844
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:07,630
and so there's.
There's a,

1845
01:26:08,440 --> 01:26:13,040
an embracing of anti-intellectualism 
that you're seeing now that I think is a

1846
01:26:13,041 --> 01:26:16,010
response to that.
I think people are scared and one of the

1847
01:26:16,011 --> 01:26:18,680
things they're trying to do when people 
are scared,

1848
01:26:18,860 --> 01:26:21,870
they do a couple things.
One thing they do is flatter.

1849
01:26:23,550 --> 01:26:28,550
There's little of that longing from back
when they thought the earth was flat,

1850
01:26:28,720 --> 01:26:33,720
flat.
I get more fucking angry people online 

1851
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:37,600
because of flat earth than anything I've
ever done other than make fun of vegans.

1852
01:26:38,220 --> 01:26:40,520
I think no way.
Fluttered.

1853
01:26:40,580 --> 01:26:43,500
There's an angry that you don't grow mad
really?

1854
01:26:43,570 --> 01:26:46,700
So everyday I get called the shill 
everyday.

1855
01:26:46,701 --> 01:26:50,300
I'm around earth shell and they tell me,
this is where it gets really hilarious.

1856
01:26:50,750 --> 01:26:52,700
Your checks were being cashed,
bro.

1857
01:26:53,160 --> 01:26:56,360
I'm getting.
I'm getting round earth shield checks.

1858
01:26:56,390 --> 01:26:58,160
I get them in the mail was george soros.

1859
01:26:58,850 --> 01:27:03,850
George soros sends me $3 a month and 
I've been open about it $3 every month 

1860
01:27:03,850 --> 01:27:08,651
to promote the idea that the earth is 
round for the less than the price of a 

1861
01:27:08,651 --> 01:27:10,040
grand day.
Starbucks coffee.

1862
01:27:10,700 --> 01:27:12,790
I am willing to protest checks,
man.

1863
01:27:12,791 --> 01:27:14,960
Got to get a protest chest.
it's so good.

1864
01:27:16,530 --> 01:27:21,530
So good.
Especially if you could send it to eat 

1865
01:27:21,530 --> 01:27:23,861
it like a whale sandwich.
You'll spend your money on something 

1866
01:27:23,861 --> 01:27:24,350
terrible.
You get that protest money and you spend

1867
01:27:24,351 --> 01:27:25,820
it on something horrible to balance it 
out.

1868
01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:27,230
You've been to Iceland,
right?

1869
01:27:27,690 --> 01:27:29,240
No.
Awesome.

1870
01:27:29,630 --> 01:27:34,630
It is amazing,
but want to go just for the northern 

1871
01:27:34,630 --> 01:27:34,670
lights are so bad.
the food's so bad because they only like

1872
01:27:34,671 --> 01:27:39,671
whale horse while they have this pickle.
This fermented shark supposed to be the 

1873
01:27:43,191 --> 01:27:48,191
fouls thing on earth and they love it.
It's almost kind of like the moon where 

1874
01:27:48,191 --> 01:27:48,650
you're like,
there's not even insects here,

1875
01:27:48,651 --> 01:27:49,390
so you understand why.

1876
01:27:50,830 --> 01:27:55,830
Why do people live here bringing their 
stuff in boxes and barges and shit.

1877
01:27:57,261 --> 01:28:01,020
Look,
we have a plant before it spoils.

1878
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:05,330
They seemed like really cool people 
don't make it grow.

1879
01:28:05,331 --> 01:28:10,331
Giants like they have a disproportionate
number of like strong man winters that 

1880
01:28:10,331 --> 01:28:11,430
come from Iceland.
Yeah,

1881
01:28:11,630 --> 01:28:13,580
vice did a whole thing on them.
They're fucking.

1882
01:28:13,850 --> 01:28:16,700
He's enormous.
Viking dogs that live up there.

1883
01:28:16,730 --> 01:28:19,310
I know they filmed the son of the,
of the game of thrones up there.

1884
01:28:19,311 --> 01:28:20,260
It's,
it's stunning.

1885
01:28:20,261 --> 01:28:22,580
I mean it really does feel like a 
different planet.

1886
01:28:22,730 --> 01:28:25,970
Isn't the mountain from there?
The fucking guy who plays the mountain,

1887
01:28:25,971 --> 01:28:28,370
that enormous strong man.
He's like the world's strongest man.

1888
01:28:28,670 --> 01:28:30,510
The mountain and game of thrones.
That guy was switched.

1889
01:28:30,530 --> 01:28:34,280
That dude's head.
You have to close your eyes.

1890
01:28:34,890 --> 01:28:39,890
One I didn't say who he was in st.
There's one.

1891
01:28:40,131 --> 01:28:41,220
Really?
Yeah,

1892
01:28:41,221 --> 01:28:41,840
it's awesome.

1893
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:42,800
See,
that's a good scene,

1894
01:28:42,801 --> 01:28:44,690
but it's one of those.
Whoa.

1895
01:28:44,930 --> 01:28:47,570
That's one of the things I really love 
about television now.

1896
01:28:47,860 --> 01:28:52,550
It's like people just fucking die like 
people that you really like,

1897
01:28:52,580 --> 01:28:54,170
they die,
you know?

1898
01:28:54,440 --> 01:28:59,440
I mean sometimes it's great.
Sometimes it's like when they killed 

1899
01:28:59,440 --> 01:28:59,440
glen with A baseball bat on walking 
dead.

1900
01:28:59,440 --> 01:28:59,900
I was like,
yeah,

1901
01:29:00,810 --> 01:29:05,810
his bulging out of his skull right here.
That's where I cut it off.

1902
01:29:07,170 --> 01:29:12,170
Absolutely.
This is a zombie show anymore torture 

1903
01:29:12,170 --> 01:29:14,900
show really as torture.
Porn and the zombies are 

1904
01:29:14,900 --> 01:29:14,900
inconsequential.
Yup.

1905
01:29:14,900 --> 01:29:19,370
All of a sudden they're not scary like 
everyone just push them away and keep 

1906
01:29:19,370 --> 01:29:21,670
running and it's seven episodes of just 
dialogue of them walking around and it's

1907
01:29:21,680 --> 01:29:21,990
like,
dude,

1908
01:29:21,991 --> 01:29:26,130
just compact this rogue one.
I loved the new star wars movie,

1909
01:29:26,131 --> 01:29:28,740
but everyone dies.
Spoiler spoiler.

1910
01:29:28,830 --> 01:29:31,840
Spoiled the fuck out of it.
But I didn't.

1911
01:29:35,390 --> 01:29:37,690
I didn't see it.
I want to see it.

1912
01:29:37,720 --> 01:29:40,890
It just didn't.
I'll tell you what I'm holding my breath

1913
01:29:40,891 --> 01:29:45,891
for everyday.
Life is downtime until the new alien 

1914
01:29:45,891 --> 01:29:46,860
movie comes out and does it create new 
alien,

1915
01:29:46,890 --> 01:29:48,210
alien,
May 19th,

1916
01:29:48,300 --> 01:29:51,090
jesus christ to ad looks awesome.
Ad for it.

1917
01:29:51,100 --> 01:29:51,810
No.
Oh,

1918
01:29:51,811 --> 01:29:54,490
let's play the trailer and the trailer.
Jamie.

1919
01:29:54,540 --> 01:29:57,090
I haven't seen the arrival of the trip.
They're not going to get mad at us.

1920
01:29:57,091 --> 01:29:57,400
We'll.
Yeah,

1921
01:29:57,460 --> 01:29:58,890
they'll take it off.
Take it off.

1922
01:29:59,990 --> 01:30:02,030
We'll play it afterwards.
Sits.

1923
01:30:02,120 --> 01:30:02,940
It's so weird.
YoU know,

1924
01:30:02,941 --> 01:30:04,440
I had a conversation with somebody about
this.

1925
01:30:05,940 --> 01:30:08,310
If you guys react to it,
we mIght be able to play it.

1926
01:30:08,580 --> 01:30:13,580
So when we talked about,
okay,

1927
01:30:14,910 --> 01:30:19,910
well listen folks,
we're just trying to sell your goddamn 

1928
01:30:19,910 --> 01:30:21,510
movie.
I'm a huge fan of those and I think this

1929
01:30:21,511 --> 01:30:23,340
is this and this.
It's not going to be ridley,

1930
01:30:23,430 --> 01:30:24,120
ridley scott.

1931
01:30:24,330 --> 01:30:27,420
I think it is really.
I think this is really solid returns.

1932
01:30:28,580 --> 01:30:31,860
She should know.
I think it's a pretty cool thing.

1933
01:30:31,870 --> 01:30:34,350
She isn't enrolled.
I think that's the idea,

1934
01:30:35,100 --> 01:30:37,410
but that was prometheus's a prequel to 
write.

1935
01:30:37,490 --> 01:30:41,540
I never thought it wasn't good.
it was to cgi.

1936
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,230
I was like,
that's not a real dude.

1937
01:30:43,780 --> 01:30:47,010
That's why star wars is so good because 
they finally bring back the cost.

1938
01:30:48,410 --> 01:30:49,390
It's great.
It's.

1939
01:30:49,690 --> 01:30:53,080
It's not a lot of cgi,
cgi,

1940
01:30:53,130 --> 01:30:54,500
a lot of star wars.
Oh,

1941
01:30:54,501 --> 01:30:59,501
you're a woman and a fucking chinese 
transgender person.

1942
01:31:00,510 --> 01:31:02,220
Like people.
Here it is.

1943
01:31:02,280 --> 01:31:03,990
Here's the official trailer.
Go full screen.

1944
01:31:03,991 --> 01:31:06,000
I'm just happy jar jar binks is out of 
the picture.

1945
01:31:06,680 --> 01:31:10,530
Sucks.
So you know what's fucked up.

1946
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:14,490
They like the old school man alien from 
the original one.

1947
01:31:14,580 --> 01:31:19,580
The computers looked so clunky.
I know what they thought were going to 

1948
01:31:19,580 --> 01:31:21,120
have for computers and what's his face 
here?

1949
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:22,280
Mcbride?
Yeah.

1950
01:31:22,290 --> 01:31:24,390
Danny mcbride.
Wow.

1951
01:31:24,391 --> 01:31:28,290
Look at kenny powers.
Isn't it so great.

1952
01:31:28,291 --> 01:31:33,291
I've never seen him play a serious role.
It's just looks so bad.

1953
01:31:33,960 --> 01:31:35,610
This is nuts.
Yeah.

1954
01:31:35,611 --> 01:31:40,611
I don't know where they filmed it.
They filmed a lot of shit in New 

1955
01:31:40,611 --> 01:31:41,220
Zealand.
that's where they did the hobbit.

1956
01:31:41,340 --> 01:31:43,740
New Zealand is one place that I really 
need to go.

1957
01:31:44,370 --> 01:31:48,230
I keep hearing how amazing it is,
but yeah,

1958
01:31:48,250 --> 01:31:53,250
this looks good.
No burns,

1959
01:31:54,540 --> 01:31:57,900
no animals.
It's like Iceland bitch.

1960
01:31:57,901 --> 01:31:59,900
That's Montana.
Okay.

1961
01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:05,070
Don't be so fucking willing to see 
animals on the planet where you don't 

1962
01:32:05,070 --> 01:32:07,410
know what can eat shit.
Damn.

1963
01:32:07,660 --> 01:32:09,190
Shit's food.
This is so cool.

1964
01:32:09,191 --> 01:32:14,191
So it's like an a planet where the 
aliens are populated planet team of 

1965
01:32:15,820 --> 01:32:19,150
people that are going to go save human 
or something like that.

1966
01:32:19,330 --> 01:32:21,370
Imagine you get paid to repopulate a 
planet.

1967
01:32:21,580 --> 01:32:24,520
Sorry.
We have to fuck to fuck for the future.

1968
01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:27,720
They don't know good.
Don't get too close to it.

1969
01:32:28,060 --> 01:32:33,060
Have you not seen these motherfuckers?
I haven't seen nothing,

1970
01:32:35,860 --> 01:32:40,860
but I just love when they do a movie 
like this and now they have these modern

1971
01:32:41,441 --> 01:32:42,730
special effects.
Totally.

1972
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:48,000
But they abused those things sometimes.
One of the coolest things about the 

1973
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,300
original alien was you saw very little 
of it.

1974
01:32:49,301 --> 01:32:54,301
Exactly.
That's the problem with all movies and 

1975
01:32:54,301 --> 01:32:55,300
tv now is you just see way too much.
There's no buildup.

1976
01:32:56,310 --> 01:33:01,310
Well,
it's also a real fear comes from the 

1977
01:33:01,310 --> 01:33:01,310
unknown.
exactly.

1978
01:33:01,310 --> 01:33:05,730
You know,
and glimpses like american werewolf in 

1979
01:33:05,730 --> 01:33:08,611
london.
You only saw like a couple of titling 

1980
01:33:08,611 --> 01:33:08,611
flashes.
Totally.

1981
01:33:08,611 --> 01:33:12,420
And it was awesome.
Whereas Stephen King movie called the 

1982
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:12,730
laying of layers.
It was.

1983
01:33:13,340 --> 01:33:18,340
I was so terrified.
I can't remember the last time I was 

1984
01:33:18,340 --> 01:33:18,560
watching a movie that I was so scared 
and terrified.

1985
01:33:18,561 --> 01:33:21,080
And then at the very end,
cgi like must've just come out.

1986
01:33:21,350 --> 01:33:24,980
They show that lear and it's like,
it looks just like this.

1987
01:33:24,981 --> 01:33:29,981
It's like a black spot on the,
on the screen here is the alien.

1988
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:32,330
The book is great.
Oh,

1989
01:33:32,331 --> 01:33:37,331
it's so good.
Show what the actual can see the little 

1990
01:33:37,331 --> 01:33:38,080
guys up there and go,
wow,

1991
01:33:38,730 --> 01:33:40,580
that's what it looks like.
That's so stupid.

1992
01:33:40,610 --> 01:33:44,130
That's sad and it was creepy.

1993
01:33:46,370 --> 01:33:51,370
You get killed by.
Look at it is that they really fly 

1994
01:33:51,370 --> 01:33:54,050
because he can't be real.
Is real real?

1995
01:33:54,080 --> 01:33:59,080
Was that a made for tv movie though?
That's probably why I didn't have any 

1996
01:33:59,080 --> 01:34:02,231
money.
And plus people that watch tv they feel 

1997
01:34:02,231 --> 01:34:04,061
like are still would have been better to
have just like little puppets on a 

1998
01:34:04,061 --> 01:34:04,061
string though,
but that would suck.

1999
01:34:04,061 --> 01:34:06,350
Like if minions really killed you,
like from despicable me.

2000
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:11,400
I felt the most like forced cultural 
thing I've ever seen the minion ad 

2001
01:34:11,541 --> 01:34:13,250
campaign here.
It's because you don't have kids.

2002
01:34:13,310 --> 01:34:17,010
It wasn't really popular kids.
It was my kids love that.

2003
01:34:17,011 --> 01:34:18,200
it makes sense.
They love it.

2004
01:34:18,201 --> 01:34:20,630
I thought it was just some weird forced 
on adults thing.

2005
01:34:20,631 --> 01:34:25,550
Like you're going to love minions shit.
I fucking love.

2006
01:34:25,610 --> 01:34:27,730
And then like you get it.
Oh that's right.

2007
01:34:27,770 --> 01:34:29,600
It's coming out.
So no,

2008
01:34:30,670 --> 01:34:32,330
we did it.
Yeah.

2009
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:33,730
Yeah.
You haven't seen it.

2010
01:34:33,890 --> 01:34:38,890
I just tried to watch it and it was like
I as six hours hours artists and artists

2011
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:42,530
one,
but the new one day they've shown it.

2012
01:34:42,531 --> 01:34:46,180
It looks way creepier.
It used to be to look creepier than used

2013
01:34:46,181 --> 01:34:48,170
to be the picture show guy.
Right.

2014
01:34:48,260 --> 01:34:49,220
It was it.
Tim,

2015
01:34:49,221 --> 01:34:51,380
what thE fuck's his name?
Was it?

2016
01:34:51,470 --> 01:34:52,240
Yeah.
Yeah,

2017
01:34:52,250 --> 01:34:54,890
yeah.
The one from the tv series.

2018
01:34:55,060 --> 01:34:58,130
Well that was extremely scary.
So that is that guy.

2019
01:34:58,820 --> 01:35:02,040
But there's some creePy images of it 
like where you see his teeth and shit.

2020
01:35:02,810 --> 01:35:03,530
But uh,
yeah,

2021
01:35:03,531 --> 01:35:05,200
it was.
What's his face from rocky horror?

2022
01:35:05,450 --> 01:35:10,450
What the hell's his name?
I've never seen rocky horror picture 

2023
01:35:13,161 --> 01:35:14,600
show.
It's one of those.

2024
01:35:14,840 --> 01:35:19,840
Yeah.
The time just to take tim curry.

2025
01:35:21,620 --> 01:35:25,010
Tim curry was the original it.
He was the original clown.

2026
01:35:25,160 --> 01:35:26,900
That's another great book.
See,

2027
01:35:26,901 --> 01:35:31,760
I feel like stephen king's movies all 
suck bad ones for sure.

2028
01:35:31,790 --> 01:35:33,380
Not that they suck.
I love Stephen King,

2029
01:35:33,390 --> 01:35:38,300
but his books are so good that the books
just don't.

2030
01:35:38,540 --> 01:35:41,720
You just can't turn it into a movie.
And like,

2031
01:35:41,780 --> 01:35:46,040
like pet cemetery was so god damn creepy
as a book.

2032
01:35:46,470 --> 01:35:48,020
And then you see the movie like,
oh,

2033
01:35:48,021 --> 01:35:49,810
the cat's going to kill me.
I'll fucking kill that cat.

2034
01:35:49,811 --> 01:35:52,130
Let me get ahold of that care.
If it's a demon.

2035
01:35:52,140 --> 01:35:53,930
Katelyn grabbed by stupid little head.

2036
01:35:54,140 --> 01:35:56,770
I'm really excited for dark tower are 
both steven.

2037
01:35:57,800 --> 01:35:59,160
Oh cool.
But stand by.

2038
01:35:59,240 --> 01:36:04,240
We're not superstitious or supernatural 
force or I think when he green mile as 

2039
01:36:06,621 --> 01:36:11,621
well,
there was like a little bit of 

2040
01:36:11,621 --> 01:36:11,621
supernatural share with Michael Clarke 
duncan,

2041
01:36:11,621 --> 01:36:15,310
but the thing is like when you turn his 
movies into something that you have to 

2042
01:36:15,310 --> 01:36:15,530
look at,
like christine,

2043
01:36:15,531 --> 01:36:18,270
they kind of pulled augustine as just 
the car,

2044
01:36:18,950 --> 01:36:22,370
but it was even creepier in the book and
then you get more,

2045
01:36:22,430 --> 01:36:27,430
you know,
you get more insight into the guy who 

2046
01:36:27,430 --> 01:36:27,430
created the car,
was sold him the car.

2047
01:36:27,570 --> 01:36:32,570
Super descriptive with his language and 
it really paints a picture that you can 

2048
01:36:32,570 --> 01:36:33,350
never do justice when you're watching 
it.

2049
01:36:33,351 --> 01:36:38,351
Well,
I'm excited for the dark tower series 

2050
01:36:38,351 --> 01:36:40,001
though,
but do you know that the shining was 

2051
01:36:40,001 --> 01:36:40,001
very different than the book?
I read the book.

2052
01:36:40,110 --> 01:36:45,110
The book's very different and he redid 
the movie with his blessing and they use

2053
01:36:45,591 --> 01:36:49,040
the guy from wings that a made for tv.

2054
01:36:49,430 --> 01:36:50,790
She was In it.
I think tears.

2055
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:55,840
The bartender didn't work,
but kubrick kubrick had a lot of weird 

2056
01:36:55,840 --> 01:37:00,311
shit in the shining,
like there's a lot of references to the 

2057
01:37:00,311 --> 01:37:02,591
apollo moon landings as long as hidden 
shit in there hook story that said that 

2058
01:37:03,231 --> 01:37:06,080
he had like proven that the moon landing
was false or whatever.

2059
01:37:06,140 --> 01:37:10,880
Well,
he definitely did a bunch of shit in the

2060
01:37:10,881 --> 01:37:15,530
shining to pay homage to the apollo moon
missions and some sort of a weird way.

2061
01:37:15,770 --> 01:37:18,560
Like there was a.
I forget,

2062
01:37:18,561 --> 01:37:20,150
there was a bunch of different things 
that were there.

2063
01:37:20,151 --> 01:37:22,790
First of all,
the little boy wore a rocket.

2064
01:37:23,030 --> 01:37:28,030
He wore look at apollo rocket sweater 
and then there was the number for one of

2065
01:37:28,911 --> 01:37:33,911
the rooms that was the exact distance 
between the earth and the moon and 

2066
01:37:33,911 --> 01:37:36,380
there's a whole documentary that goes 
over in depth.

2067
01:37:36,381 --> 01:37:41,381
The connections that kubrick made 
between the shining and the apollo moon 

2068
01:37:41,381 --> 01:37:41,381
missions.

2069
01:37:41,381 --> 01:37:42,950
It's fucking pretty intense stuff.
Awesome.

2070
01:37:43,220 --> 01:37:44,770
Yeah,
and it was just a.

2071
01:37:44,810 --> 01:37:47,240
It was a different book though.
The book,

2072
01:37:47,300 --> 01:37:50,390
the book was a slow build before 
jackets.

2073
01:37:50,450 --> 01:37:54,260
Crazy.
And then in the movie Jack Nicholson was

2074
01:37:54,261 --> 01:37:59,261
like crazy already.
He was like a little crazy and then it 

2075
01:37:59,261 --> 01:38:03,471
just got crazy and crazier.
Whereas in the book he like slowly 

2076
01:38:03,471 --> 01:38:07,791
became more and more nutty and you 
bought into it like you saw him like 

2077
01:38:07,791 --> 01:38:12,261
getting taken by this crazy hotel and so
he didn't like cooper x interpretation 

2078
01:38:13,591 --> 01:38:14,190
and that the,
no,

2079
01:38:14,191 --> 01:38:16,830
he didn't like,
he didn't like that apparently.

2080
01:38:16,860 --> 01:38:21,540
Which is too bad because it just,
he just can't make a book into a movie,

2081
01:38:21,850 --> 01:38:22,920
you know,
like he,

2082
01:38:23,010 --> 01:38:25,530
I guess he can but they're just not as 
good.

2083
01:38:25,980 --> 01:38:30,980
You know?
I hate people that say that though I'm 

2084
01:38:30,980 --> 01:38:33,501
saying it and I hate people that say 
that the book is the book we don't read 

2085
01:38:33,501 --> 01:38:33,501
anymore.

2086
01:38:33,560 --> 01:38:36,180
I think people will read.
I hardly read anymore.

2087
01:38:36,270 --> 01:38:38,610
I'm going to be honest with you.
I listened to books on tape,

2088
01:38:39,310 --> 01:38:42,270
hardly sit down and read them.
I still read them a little bit,

2089
01:38:42,570 --> 01:38:46,530
but I enjoy having someone read for me.
That's awesome.

2090
01:38:46,710 --> 01:38:50,190
But it feels like a fraud.
Like when I say if I tell someone I read

2091
01:38:50,191 --> 01:38:52,950
a book,
I have to read some of the book to say I

2092
01:38:52,951 --> 01:38:54,420
read the book right?
Like,

2093
01:38:54,421 --> 01:38:56,840
but I'll read part of it and they'll go 
book on tape and then I go,

2094
01:38:56,850 --> 01:38:59,550
I read that book,
but I didn't really read it.

2095
01:38:59,551 --> 01:39:04,551
I only read like three chapters and the 
other 11 that had some actor read if you

2096
01:39:07,360 --> 01:39:08,670
tell.
But if you tell somebody,

2097
01:39:08,671 --> 01:39:10,050
yeah,
I listen to a lot of books on tape.

2098
01:39:10,080 --> 01:39:10,430
Like,
oh,

2099
01:39:10,440 --> 01:39:15,440
you fucking moron.
But no one's tried to have you write a 

2100
01:39:15,440 --> 01:39:15,440
book yet.

2101
01:39:15,440 --> 01:39:17,850
Oh yeah.
I had a book deal and it was so brutal.

2102
01:39:18,120 --> 01:39:20,940
Talk to the editor was so brutal.
I gave them their money back.

2103
01:39:22,110 --> 01:39:26,130
What was the book about?
Just short a bunch of essays on things,

2104
01:39:26,131 --> 01:39:28,500
but they wanted,
this is what they asked me to do.

2105
01:39:28,680 --> 01:39:31,830
They asked me to transcribe my standup 
once they were like,

2106
01:39:31,960 --> 01:39:36,960
they read some of my writing because I 
used to do a lot of blogs and I used to 

2107
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:40,041
put a lot of blogs on my website and I 
put them on online and some other 

2108
01:39:40,041 --> 01:39:40,800
venues.
And um,

2109
01:39:40,920 --> 01:39:41,760
they were like,
hey,

2110
01:39:41,761 --> 01:39:46,761
we want to give you a book deal and 
what's just write whatever you want to 

2111
01:39:46,761 --> 01:39:46,761
watch.
Okay.

2112
01:39:46,761 --> 01:39:49,791
Yeah.
And then once you get some money from 

2113
01:39:49,791 --> 01:39:49,791
them,
then it's like,

2114
01:39:49,791 --> 01:39:50,190
we want you to write what we want you to
write.

2115
01:39:50,370 --> 01:39:51,980
And then they wanted me to write the.

2116
01:39:52,010 --> 01:39:55,380
One of the thoughts was they wanted me 
to take my stand up and transcribe it.

2117
01:39:55,590 --> 01:39:56,970
I go,
that's gotta be terrible.

2118
01:39:57,180 --> 01:39:58,380
Bizarre.
But they were like,

2119
01:39:58,480 --> 01:40:00,550
george carlin did it,
but jerry seinfeld did.

2120
01:40:00,570 --> 01:40:00,930
I'm like,
no,

2121
01:40:00,931 --> 01:40:04,860
they took a check and you know,
maybe they wanted the money.

2122
01:40:04,861 --> 01:40:06,850
I don't know,
maybe george had taxes city I pay,

2123
01:40:06,851 --> 01:40:08,340
I dunno,
I'm not doing that.

2124
01:40:08,580 --> 01:40:09,540
And so they said,
okay,

2125
01:40:09,690 --> 01:40:13,820
well we want you to think that you want 
to get a laugh like onstage,

2126
01:40:13,830 --> 01:40:15,360
like every 30 seconds.
And I was like,

2127
01:40:15,390 --> 01:40:16,770
well,
I'm going to write about some stuff that

2128
01:40:16,771 --> 01:40:21,771
I don't even think it's funny.
And then no one does that when they're 

2129
01:40:21,771 --> 01:40:24,330
reading a book labs every 30 seconds.
So I sent them a chapter and they edited

2130
01:40:24,331 --> 01:40:29,331
it and changed a bunch of.
Sheila changed the tone of it and I'm 

2131
01:40:29,331 --> 01:40:29,331
like,
we're done.

2132
01:40:29,590 --> 01:40:34,590
I called my manager,
I go tell them we're giving the money 

2133
01:40:34,590 --> 01:40:34,590
back.
And they were like,

2134
01:40:34,590 --> 01:40:34,590
are you fucking serious?
I go,

2135
01:40:34,590 --> 01:40:34,830
yeah,
I'll give them their money back.

2136
01:40:34,860 --> 01:40:39,860
I don't want to do it.
It's crazy that they would actually 

2137
01:40:39,860 --> 01:40:39,860
change the language of what,
how you would even write.

2138
01:40:39,900 --> 01:40:43,170
I'm never going to do it again.
That way if I do do it again,

2139
01:40:43,171 --> 01:40:48,171
if I do write a book,
I'm going to write a book and then I'm 

2140
01:40:48,171 --> 01:40:48,330
going to sell the book or I'm going to 
put the book online.

2141
01:40:48,331 --> 01:40:53,331
If nobody wants to buy it,
if nobody wants to buy it and turn it 

2142
01:40:53,331 --> 01:40:53,331
into a book,
I'm going to go,

2143
01:40:53,331 --> 01:40:53,510
okay,
this is the blood your own.

2144
01:40:53,550 --> 01:40:57,640
Now you can think it sucks,
but at least it sucks.

2145
01:40:57,641 --> 01:41:00,130
And it came from my head and my fingers 
like,

2146
01:41:00,131 --> 01:41:00,920
I'm going to write it.

2147
01:41:00,970 --> 01:41:05,970
I'm going to think it.
You can totally think it sucks and you 

2148
01:41:05,970 --> 01:41:08,221
don't want it that and look,
there's just the reality of things is 

2149
01:41:08,221 --> 01:41:13,081
when someone creates something,
it's gonna resonate with a certain 

2150
01:41:13,081 --> 01:41:13,081
amount of people and other people are 
going to hate it.

2151
01:41:13,081 --> 01:41:16,330
Just fucking music that I think is 
terrible and people love it.

2152
01:41:16,331 --> 01:41:21,331
They wait in line,
they go to see these concerts that I 

2153
01:41:21,331 --> 01:41:24,420
just,
you would have to strap me to a chair 

2154
01:41:24,420 --> 01:41:27,120
and prime my eyes open like clockwork 
orange for me to sit there and watch it 

2155
01:41:27,120 --> 01:41:30,691
and they can't wait.
It can wait so tastes and and people's 

2156
01:41:30,761 --> 01:41:35,761
desires very.
But as soon as someone who tries to 

2157
01:41:35,761 --> 01:41:38,710
enforce their ideas of like what you,
how you should express yourself.

2158
01:41:39,100 --> 01:41:44,100
To me,
I thought of it as like very similar to 

2159
01:41:44,100 --> 01:41:44,760
stand up in the way that like if,
if my standup,

2160
01:41:44,770 --> 01:41:49,770
if somebody came along and was like,
like some publicists that I didn't even 

2161
01:41:49,770 --> 01:41:53,251
know,
not even a friend and wanted to edit my 

2162
01:41:53,251 --> 01:41:53,251
standup.

2163
01:41:53,251 --> 01:41:54,040
You can think my standup socks,
you can not like it,

2164
01:41:54,130 --> 01:41:57,400
but if as long as I'm actually paying 
attention to it,

2165
01:41:57,610 --> 01:42:02,610
as long as I'm actually sitting there 
and I'm actually going over it and then 

2166
01:42:02,610 --> 01:42:04,840
editing it and in thinking about it 
myself and practicing and onstage,

2167
01:42:05,020 --> 01:42:07,510
I don't want your opinion.
I don't want your input.

2168
01:42:07,720 --> 01:42:09,330
You either like it or you don't know 
exactly,

2169
01:42:09,370 --> 01:42:10,600
but it's me.
Right?

2170
01:42:10,890 --> 01:42:12,490
No.
Came out and it sucked.

2171
01:42:12,580 --> 01:42:14,050
And then people would be like,
you suck.

2172
01:42:14,051 --> 01:42:14,650
You're like,
no,

2173
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:17,590
it actually isn't me.
It's this ghost writer and he sucks.

2174
01:42:18,030 --> 01:42:20,500
But I think the movie has to be a 
collaboration,

2175
01:42:20,530 --> 01:42:21,910
right?
Like if you're doing a movie,

2176
01:42:21,911 --> 01:42:24,040
you have actors,
you have writers,

2177
01:42:24,041 --> 01:42:26,440
you have directors,
you have producers,

2178
01:42:26,441 --> 01:42:28,030
you have the people that are giving you 
the money.

2179
01:42:28,660 --> 01:42:31,090
That's got to be a goddamn nightmare 
because there's a lot of,

2180
01:42:31,450 --> 01:42:33,430
lot of different cooks in that kitchen.

2181
01:42:33,580 --> 01:42:36,510
But that makes sense to me that you have
to collaborate with these people.

2182
01:42:36,511 --> 01:42:38,320
Like if you see,
if you're playing some,

2183
01:42:38,950 --> 01:42:40,600
some chicken,
some movie,

2184
01:42:40,720 --> 01:42:42,010
and you're,
you know,

2185
01:42:42,011 --> 01:42:43,930
you have this idea of how it's supposed 
to be.

2186
01:42:43,931 --> 01:42:48,931
That's how you audition.
But then you get on set and the 

2187
01:42:48,931 --> 01:42:48,931
director's like,
abby,

2188
01:42:48,931 --> 01:42:51,290
what I want you to do is play a chinese 
lady 1500.

2189
01:42:51,790 --> 01:42:52,600
You're like,
what?

2190
01:42:52,750 --> 01:42:54,130
You know,
you'd be like,

2191
01:42:54,131 --> 01:42:56,530
but that's not what I got hired to do.
Like what the fuck is this?

2192
01:42:56,740 --> 01:43:01,740
Then you have this chaotic sort of 
struggle between the director and the 

2193
01:43:01,931 --> 01:43:06,931
producers telling you to act one way and
it's a lot of nonsense that one of the 

2194
01:43:06,931 --> 01:43:11,191
pure things about writing,
whether it's writing stand up or 

2195
01:43:11,191 --> 01:43:15,091
anything,
it's like it's here's the world and 

2196
01:43:15,091 --> 01:43:15,091
here's,
here's my vision,

2197
01:43:15,091 --> 01:43:16,120
here's the world through my eyes and my 
fingers,

2198
01:43:16,121 --> 01:43:19,180
and as soon as you allow someone to 
start fucking with that,

2199
01:43:19,181 --> 01:43:24,181
I just think it's a recipe for disaster.
So my experience wasn't good.

2200
01:43:24,430 --> 01:43:29,430
Not that you can't have a good 
experience writing a book and maybe 

2201
01:43:29,430 --> 01:43:30,160
other people have,
but everybody that I've talked to,

2202
01:43:30,161 --> 01:43:31,600
the wrote a book tolerable.
Yeah.

2203
01:43:31,601 --> 01:43:36,601
That told me it was terrible.
Everybody I know that wrote a book I 

2204
01:43:36,601 --> 01:43:37,260
have to talk to whitney about.
She didn't have a bad experience.

2205
01:43:38,610 --> 01:43:40,630
Get there.
Go use that restroom.

2206
01:43:40,740 --> 01:43:45,740
Every.
Abby martin is my favorite hardcore 

2207
01:43:45,740 --> 01:43:48,781
lefty.
I think she can't figure out where the 

2208
01:43:48,781 --> 01:43:48,781
doors.

2209
01:43:49,180 --> 01:43:51,860
She's my favorite hardcore lefty.
She so rabid.

2210
01:43:52,240 --> 01:43:57,240
She said,
I want to get her in a room with sam 

2211
01:43:57,240 --> 01:43:58,961
harris though,
because she hates sam harris and she 

2212
01:43:58,961 --> 01:44:01,070
thinks sam harris wants to fucking bomb 
every country where brown people live.

2213
01:44:01,370 --> 01:44:04,010
She just takes things.
She see how she ramps up.

2214
01:44:04,340 --> 01:44:09,340
Like she wants to take things so far,
like you can't even talk to her about 

2215
01:44:09,340 --> 01:44:12,260
like what social justice warriors do.
She was like,

2216
01:44:12,500 --> 01:44:14,390
she's not even thinking about it,
that she's just like,

2217
01:44:14,391 --> 01:44:14,930
yeah,
but why?

2218
01:44:14,931 --> 01:44:15,230
Why?
Why?

2219
01:44:15,231 --> 01:44:17,600
They're paying attention to that while 
trump is doing this and they're ready to

2220
01:44:17,601 --> 01:44:20,660
bomb North Korea and yet,
but it's still an issue.

2221
01:44:20,810 --> 01:44:23,450
It's still something.
There's a thing going on.

2222
01:44:24,300 --> 01:44:25,400
Yeah.
It's hard to pick.

2223
01:44:26,060 --> 01:44:27,390
Pick your thing.
Yeah.

2224
01:44:27,450 --> 01:44:29,780
One and be like you said so much info 
going on.

2225
01:44:29,781 --> 01:44:30,950
Now.
You get distracted from one,

2226
01:44:30,951 --> 01:44:33,710
especially if you have a tinge of add.
I do.

2227
01:44:34,310 --> 01:44:35,110
Don't you?
Yeah,

2228
01:44:35,130 --> 01:44:36,110
will for sure.
Who doesn't?

2229
01:44:36,370 --> 01:44:39,010
I don't trust people don't have add.
You know,

2230
01:44:39,100 --> 01:44:42,370
like you can concentrate all the time.
I feel like one of those people that can

2231
01:44:42,371 --> 01:44:45,550
really sit down and concentrate.
Totally cp that Quick.

2232
01:44:45,551 --> 01:44:47,680
That's the scene where you open it up 
like a bucket.

2233
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:53,640
How's that even possible?
That doesn't even make sense with me.

2234
01:44:54,100 --> 01:44:54,730
What are you saying jamie?

2235
01:44:54,790 --> 01:44:57,580
See the lambs being born outside of a 
wound.

2236
01:44:57,610 --> 01:45:02,610
Did you set story going around today?
That's the apocalypse silence and not 

2237
01:45:02,610 --> 01:45:04,390
like they weren't.
They weren't a holy god made in there,

2238
01:45:04,391 --> 01:45:06,760
but it waS.
It's being tested on.

2239
01:45:07,240 --> 01:45:09,760
I think it was sheep,
like a premature births,

2240
01:45:10,240 --> 01:45:14,740
so after a instead of a 37 week period,
if it wAs like 28 weeks,

2241
01:45:14,741 --> 01:45:17,350
they could put it in the sack and it was
still growing.

2242
01:45:18,470 --> 01:45:22,180
Hair eyes opened up.
I'll show you the story real quick.

2243
01:45:22,930 --> 01:45:24,520
Do you see that blowjob machine,

2244
01:45:25,460 --> 01:45:30,460
this new blowjob robot that they 
invented just for blowjobs one better 

2245
01:45:30,460 --> 01:45:31,470
than the the lip thing that you.
What?

2246
01:45:31,530 --> 01:45:32,640
What was it called?
Flashlight.

2247
01:45:33,420 --> 01:45:34,950
You have to actually move that thing 
around.

2248
01:45:34,980 --> 01:45:35,760
Whoa.
Look at this.

2249
01:45:36,730 --> 01:45:41,730
Oh my god.
Artificial womb successfully grew baby 

2250
01:45:41,730 --> 01:45:42,090
sheep and humans could be next.
All my god,

2251
01:45:42,110 --> 01:45:47,110
we're.
We're lookIng at this plastic bag where 

2252
01:45:47,110 --> 01:45:49,710
this baby sheep is inside a positive 
lamb is growing in an artificial womb.

2253
01:45:49,711 --> 01:45:51,420
For weeks,
oh christ,

2254
01:45:51,720 --> 01:45:52,260
what are we doing?

2255
01:45:53,720 --> 01:45:58,720
It seems like the next step that 
definitely try making one in a bag next 

2256
01:45:58,720 --> 01:45:59,600
to look in China,
babies and bags and you probably already

2257
01:45:59,601 --> 01:46:01,790
have a person that they've made and this
is nUts.

2258
01:46:01,791 --> 01:46:03,560
As soon as they started telling you 
about this,

2259
01:46:03,590 --> 01:46:04,820
it's.
It's already hAppened.

2260
01:46:04,821 --> 01:46:09,821
They've already 20 years ago now and 
they're just showing us now is probably 

2261
01:46:10,550 --> 01:46:13,820
ivanka trump was probably born and 
raisEd in a bag.

2262
01:46:14,540 --> 01:46:17,510
That's how we know chinese.
Chinese still alive.

2263
01:46:17,630 --> 01:46:19,770
That's why she's so pretty her.
Right.

2264
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:24,840
They engineered their two sons.
She came out perfect.

2265
01:46:26,720 --> 01:46:28,370
They were definitely grown in bags.
Well,

2266
01:46:28,371 --> 01:46:30,350
he knows how to cook up a girl.
Yeah,

2267
01:46:30,351 --> 01:46:31,380
right.
Like the.

2268
01:46:31,381 --> 01:46:34,040
The genes work good on girls.
They weren't good on her,

2269
01:46:34,041 --> 01:46:36,170
that's for sure.
Fuck his.

2270
01:46:36,230 --> 01:46:38,900
Her husband Is gross.
He's so odd.

2271
01:46:39,350 --> 01:46:43,720
the video of him in Iraq or Afghanistan 
with the flak jacket on him.

2272
01:46:43,730 --> 01:46:47,510
He's a preppy jaslin walking around.
It's like gq,

2273
01:46:47,511 --> 01:46:49,500
like endless war.
Fucking

2274
01:46:50,960 --> 01:46:51,900
weird.
Yes.

2275
01:46:51,920 --> 01:46:56,920
Sick.
Why didn't you give him like some 

2276
01:46:56,920 --> 01:46:56,920
military glows.
What?

2277
01:46:56,920 --> 01:47:00,320
like a complete douche bag.
He looks like he's never worked a 

2278
01:47:00,320 --> 01:47:00,320
goddamn day in his life.
Prep school,

2279
01:47:00,320 --> 01:47:04,611
kid with a vest on soft hAnds.
J dot crew.

2280
01:47:05,060 --> 01:47:07,710
Yes.
His hands probably tear on sand.

2281
01:47:08,530 --> 01:47:11,310
Just irritated.
Just being like,

2282
01:47:16,020 --> 01:47:17,370
when can I come home,
papa?

2283
01:47:18,230 --> 01:47:19,320
Look at them.
They're like,

2284
01:47:19,330 --> 01:47:22,620
what a complete look kush.
What is that?

2285
01:47:25,520 --> 01:47:28,420
They don't even have good word.
People that give you the afghans.

2286
01:47:28,970 --> 01:47:31,480
No,
that's.

2287
01:47:32,780 --> 01:47:37,780
That is one of the most open secrets and
and going back to why are we in 

2288
01:47:37,780 --> 01:47:38,730
Afghanistan?
Yeah,

2289
01:47:38,790 --> 01:47:39,930
come on.
Yeah.

2290
01:47:40,200 --> 01:47:41,550
Well why were we in Vietnam?

2291
01:47:45,950 --> 01:47:47,940
But the.
It was one of the most open,

2292
01:47:47,980 --> 01:47:50,550
like the information is readily 
available.

2293
01:47:50,551 --> 01:47:55,551
Totally.
The amount of heroin production that 

2294
01:47:55,551 --> 01:47:57,440
ramped up since we invaded Afghanistan.
It's insane.

2295
01:47:57,460 --> 01:48:00,330
Present and opiod latex as needed for 
pharmaceuticals.

2296
01:48:00,331 --> 01:48:01,950
It's,
it just goes on and on and on.

2297
01:48:02,160 --> 01:48:04,350
It's completely obvious and it's going 
to come out soon.

2298
01:48:04,351 --> 01:48:06,390
I think that that's really what's 
happening there.

2299
01:48:06,420 --> 01:48:07,620
Do you think so?
Absolute.

2300
01:48:07,650 --> 01:48:09,930
how's it going to come out now?
It's 15 years later.

2301
01:48:09,970 --> 01:48:11,580
Good question.
I mean it came out.

2302
01:48:11,640 --> 01:48:13,200
Yeah.
when did the sandinista,

2303
01:48:13,201 --> 01:48:15,990
like when did all the cocaine 
trafficking stuff come out?

2304
01:48:16,020 --> 01:48:18,860
We made an all over north freeway.
Rupert.

2305
01:48:19,290 --> 01:48:20,900
Yeah,
exactly.

2306
01:48:20,901 --> 01:48:22,600
I'm like rupert,
totally.

2307
01:48:23,300 --> 01:48:28,300
Such a tortured soul to him.
He was such a tortured soul come in at 

2308
01:48:29,230 --> 01:48:31,980
times that god gave me mushrooms.
Nice.

2309
01:48:32,080 --> 01:48:34,710
He came on my podcast,
brought me a giant bag of mushrooms.

2310
01:48:36,540 --> 01:48:38,250
Good man.
Great guy.

2311
01:48:38,540 --> 01:48:39,570
Good guy.
Loved him.

2312
01:48:39,571 --> 01:48:41,890
I didn't agree with.
I didn't agree with them because he was.

2313
01:48:41,910 --> 01:48:46,910
He was so crazy about so many different 
things about peak oil and stuff like 

2314
01:48:46,910 --> 01:48:49,020
that whole lung collapsed documentary 
that they did where they interviewed him

2315
01:48:49,021 --> 01:48:50,460
and he's just sitting there smoking 
cigarettes,

2316
01:48:50,461 --> 01:48:51,690
talking about the end is near.
I'm like,

2317
01:48:51,691 --> 01:48:53,250
jesus dude.
Meanwhile,

2318
01:48:53,251 --> 01:48:55,020
all these years later,
everything's fine.

2319
01:48:55,500 --> 01:49:00,500
Like he wasn't right about peak oil and 
a lot of the other things and he was 

2320
01:49:00,500 --> 01:49:02,040
always inclined to go towards doom and 
gloom,

2321
01:49:02,041 --> 01:49:07,041
but I think that that movie,
that documentary collapse and his 

2322
01:49:07,800 --> 01:49:12,800
worldview,
it was a lot of it was based on how he 

2323
01:49:12,800 --> 01:49:15,291
thought of things because he was really 
depressed and just kind of an 

2324
01:49:15,291 --> 01:49:16,380
externalization of his own.
He was depression,

2325
01:49:16,820 --> 01:49:19,020
anyone up often themselves,
so horrible.

2326
01:49:19,050 --> 01:49:24,050
That was one of the saddest suicides of 
people that I knew when I knew that he 

2327
01:49:24,050 --> 01:49:26,340
killed himself because he is.
He sent me some emails.

2328
01:49:26,970 --> 01:49:31,500
We talked back and forth and he was.
He was definitely like down in the dumps

2329
01:49:31,710 --> 01:49:34,500
and I always felt like god man,
like fuck,

2330
01:49:34,501 --> 01:49:38,700
I just needs better people around him 
and he just needs more positivity,

2331
01:49:38,701 --> 01:49:43,701
but he was so engrossed and entrenched 
in corruption and greed and all this 

2332
01:49:44,831 --> 01:49:49,831
stuff that you saw,
but I'll never forget that fucking 

2333
01:49:49,831 --> 01:49:49,831
speech

2334
01:49:49,831 --> 01:49:50,230
when he stood in front of like.
What was that?

2335
01:49:50,231 --> 01:49:51,360
Lapd.
yes.

2336
01:49:51,600 --> 01:49:56,600
Well,
he was an art was an lap narcotics 

2337
01:49:56,600 --> 01:49:58,981
officer and he stood in front of that 
cia guy and the.

2338
01:49:59,320 --> 01:50:04,320
I forget what the meeting was about and 
he was talking about how he had 

2339
01:50:04,320 --> 01:50:08,470
witnessed cia agents selling narcotics 
and the ela and that they had been doing

2340
01:50:08,471 --> 01:50:13,471
it forever and that he had been stopped 
from prosecuting and arresting them and 

2341
01:50:13,471 --> 01:50:15,450
everybody went crazy and nuts.
It was nuts.

2342
01:50:15,490 --> 01:50:20,490
And then he.
He exposed the whole insider trading 

2343
01:50:20,490 --> 01:50:21,730
nine slash 11 stuff and peak oil and 
yeah,

2344
01:50:21,731 --> 01:50:26,731
I mean he was just lambaste it as a 
conspiracy theory is toward the end of 

2345
01:50:26,731 --> 01:50:28,470
his life and it was really sad because 
he's done so many amazing things.

2346
01:50:29,050 --> 01:50:34,050
That waS a,
that was 1996 town meeting in los 

2347
01:50:34,050 --> 01:50:37,591
angeles on allegations and this is by 
the way folks pre internet and 

2348
01:50:37,591 --> 01:50:41,820
confronting the cia director and with 
the ball the way he did it.

2349
01:50:42,370 --> 01:50:47,230
I mean he did it like clearly and loudly
and articulately like it.

2350
01:50:47,260 --> 01:50:50,810
Just play it so people who haven't seen 
it for my group are important.

2351
01:50:52,800 --> 01:50:54,640
Backing up a little bit below.

2352
01:50:54,700 --> 01:50:54,810
Yeah.

2353
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,830
I will tell you directly as a former los
angeles police,

2354
01:50:58,831 --> 01:51:03,831
narcotics detective,
that the agency has dealt drugs 

2355
01:51:03,831 --> 01:51:03,831
throughout this country for me.

2356
01:51:21,080 --> 01:51:24,170
Obviously that is an answer for a lot of
you.

2357
01:51:24,171 --> 01:51:27,090
And now can you please.
I refer now.

2358
01:51:27,100 --> 01:51:29,480
Can you place I referred to,
right?

2359
01:51:29,770 --> 01:51:30,290
Wait,
wait,

2360
01:51:30,330 --> 01:51:32,260
wait,
wait.

2361
01:51:38,460 --> 01:51:42,890
It was so boring.

2362
01:51:43,510 --> 01:51:48,510
Why managed care about it?
If you don't like what's going on here,

2363
01:51:49,101 --> 01:51:50,720
please leave now.

2364
01:51:53,330 --> 01:51:54,350
No,
I haven't seen.

2365
01:51:54,430 --> 01:51:58,210
I was trying to control what people are 
going crazy.

2366
01:51:58,211 --> 01:51:59,570
I mean this was in south central.

2367
01:52:00,080 --> 01:52:04,960
Please take your states.
I will get back to you as we rolled back

2368
01:52:04,961 --> 01:52:06,520
across to the center section

2369
01:52:09,550 --> 01:52:10,310
director,
deutsche.

2370
01:52:10,330 --> 01:52:14,080
I will refer you to three specific 
agency operations known as um,

2371
01:52:14,081 --> 01:52:19,081
a day as pegasus and watchtower resected
by the agency.

2372
01:52:20,830 --> 01:52:25,830
I was personally exposed to cia 
operations and recruited by cia 

2373
01:52:25,830 --> 01:52:29,671
personnel who attempted to recruit me 
and the late seventies to become 

2374
01:52:29,671 --> 01:52:31,690
involved in protecting agency drug 
operations in this country.

2375
01:52:32,080 --> 01:52:35,080
I have been trying to get this out for 
18 years and I have the evidence.

2376
01:52:35,081 --> 01:52:36,700
my question,
if he was very specific,

2377
01:52:36,701 --> 01:52:41,701
sir.
If in the course of the igs 

2378
01:52:41,701 --> 01:52:41,701
investigations and fred,
his,

2379
01:52:41,701 --> 01:52:45,841
his work,
you'll come across evidence of severely 

2380
01:52:45,841 --> 01:52:47,810
criminal activity.
It's classified well,

2381
01:52:47,811 --> 01:52:52,811
you use that classification to hide the 
criminal activity or will you tell the 

2382
01:52:52,811 --> 01:52:52,811
american people the truth?

2383
01:53:05,750 --> 01:53:08,070
She's not the best at keeping this group
together,

2384
01:53:08,071 --> 01:53:13,071
but that was an intense,
amazing god that opened up a lot of 

2385
01:53:13,071 --> 01:53:13,071
people's eyes.
Like that was a very,

2386
01:53:13,071 --> 01:53:16,440
very important moment.
It was where people realized like,

2387
01:53:16,441 --> 01:53:17,790
wait a minute is this guy.
right,

2388
01:53:17,940 --> 01:53:22,940
and then it turns out he was.
I mean they really did sell drugs to 

2389
01:53:22,940 --> 01:53:25,650
fund these black ops and that's how 
they.

2390
01:53:25,680 --> 01:53:30,680
That's the whole oliver north.
That's the connection between freeway 

2391
01:53:30,680 --> 01:53:30,850
ricky,
who I also had an apartment.

2392
01:53:30,900 --> 01:53:35,900
I mean that's how he made millions and 
millions of dollars by selling the cia's

2393
01:53:36,090 --> 01:53:41,090
drugs and that's how they funded the 
contract versus the sandinistas unreal.

2394
01:53:41,250 --> 01:53:46,250
Fucking crazy.
And you're telling me that this opium 

2395
01:53:46,250 --> 01:53:46,470
just leaving Afghanistan without being 
monitored or,

2396
01:53:46,480 --> 01:53:51,480
or trafficked whatsoever.
they must have done a way better job of 

2397
01:53:51,480 --> 01:53:51,480
keeping it together.
They're like,

2398
01:53:51,480 --> 01:53:52,580
look,
maybe they learned something,

2399
01:53:53,420 --> 01:53:55,500
not have another oliver north type deal.

2400
01:53:55,930 --> 01:53:57,360
Yeah,
that shit ain't no good.

2401
01:53:58,150 --> 01:54:00,990
I think Afghanistan to this,
the only other country other than if I'm

2402
01:54:00,991 --> 01:54:02,130
not mistaken,
Kenya,

2403
01:54:02,160 --> 01:54:06,180
that is actually not only the metadata,
you know,

2404
01:54:06,181 --> 01:54:07,680
like we're collecting metadata 
everywhere,

2405
01:54:07,681 --> 01:54:12,681
but that is one of two countries in the 
world that wikileaks exposed that we're 

2406
01:54:12,681 --> 01:54:16,161
actually collecting every phone call.
Every phone call is being archived and 

2407
01:54:16,161 --> 01:54:16,161
recorded from Afghanistan.
So,

2408
01:54:16,161 --> 01:54:20,520
which kind of adds to the weirdness that
somehow these giant heroin,

2409
01:54:20,970 --> 01:54:25,970
opium manufacturing operations going on 
and we still can't get a grasp on where 

2410
01:54:25,970 --> 01:54:29,190
it's coming from.
Yet it really affects America.

2411
01:54:29,191 --> 01:54:29,940
I mean,
god damn.

2412
01:54:29,941 --> 01:54:31,710
What is it like more than car crashes 
now?

2413
01:54:31,711 --> 01:54:36,030
Our pill overdoses and opiate overdoses.
It's nuts.

2414
01:54:36,410 --> 01:54:41,100
It's just surpassed car accidents for 
the first time ever and insane.

2415
01:54:41,130 --> 01:54:44,490
I had dennis mckenna on recently was 
explaining to me,

2416
01:54:44,670 --> 01:54:45,570
yeah,
it was pretty awesome.

2417
01:54:45,571 --> 01:54:47,820
He's such a genIus man.
He's so spooky.

2418
01:54:47,821 --> 01:54:50,490
Smart.
But he was explaining to me carfentanil,

2419
01:54:50,491 --> 01:54:55,491
which is a new form of fentanyl that's 
even more powerful than fentanyl still 

2420
01:54:55,491 --> 01:54:55,491
scheduled to though.

2421
01:54:57,480 --> 01:55:02,480
Marijuana schedule one never killed a 
fucking human being ever that he was 

2422
01:55:02,670 --> 01:55:07,260
saying that the head of a pin contains 
enough for you to die of an overdose.

2423
01:55:08,970 --> 01:55:10,290
Yeah.
What?

2424
01:55:10,370 --> 01:55:12,120
Why?
Why would he do that?

2425
01:55:14,070 --> 01:55:18,210
Why don't we make that easy?
Because like hippos,

2426
01:55:18,240 --> 01:55:20,130
we need a handout.
They hurt.

2427
01:55:20,160 --> 01:55:23,100
They have joint aches.
His poor hippos.

2428
01:55:23,250 --> 01:55:28,250
We have to figure out.
We have to figure out how to to 

2429
01:55:28,250 --> 01:55:29,970
authoritarians brace for more overdoses 
after Maryland desa linked to elephants.

2430
01:55:29,971 --> 01:55:30,590
Additive,
yeah,

2431
01:55:31,200 --> 01:55:33,580
horse tranquilizers now run elephant 
sedatives.

2432
01:55:33,630 --> 01:55:35,640
I thought we were on ketamine and now 
we're on.

2433
01:55:36,060 --> 01:55:41,060
Now we're on a.
It's so potent to overdoses 10,000

2434
01:55:42,091 --> 01:55:43,680
times more potent and time.

2435
01:55:44,610 --> 01:55:49,440
5,000
times more potent than a thousand times.

2436
01:55:49,530 --> 01:55:54,530
Not like 110.
That is so insane.

2437
01:55:54,780 --> 01:55:59,780
This is why philip seymour hoffman and 
so many other people die of overdoses 

2438
01:55:59,780 --> 01:56:02,940
because the drug war and these people 
just sell like laced heroin and shit.

2439
01:56:02,941 --> 01:56:05,510
And It's so dangerous and yeah,
it's,

2440
01:56:05,640 --> 01:56:10,640
it's absolutely horrible.
When we were talking about bourdain's 

2441
01:56:10,640 --> 01:56:13,461
show,
he had a great show on Massachusetts on 

2442
01:56:13,461 --> 01:56:16,540
cnn show and it was about the heroin 
epidemic that's hit Massachusetts and 

2443
01:56:16,540 --> 01:56:21,201
many other places as well.
But he kind of talked about 

2444
01:56:21,201 --> 01:56:21,201
Massachusetts because,
um,

2445
01:56:21,360 --> 01:56:26,360
they,
they had a few people that they were 

2446
01:56:26,360 --> 01:56:28,071
referring to where these people,
they got hooked on oxycontin and 

2447
01:56:28,071 --> 01:56:29,340
oxycodone.
I don't know what the difference is to,

2448
01:56:29,341 --> 01:56:31,030
you know,
um,

2449
01:56:31,110 --> 01:56:34,440
and then they made it much more 
difficult to get.

2450
01:56:34,620 --> 01:56:36,570
And then as soon as these people made it
much more difficult to get.

2451
01:56:36,570 --> 01:56:39,860
You're dealing with these people that 
have addictions and so then they started

2452
01:56:39,861 --> 01:56:44,861
doing actual heroin,
so they're taking hillbilly heroin and 

2453
01:56:44,861 --> 01:56:45,820
then they get addicted to that.
You know,

2454
01:56:45,840 --> 01:56:48,660
if you have a back pain or you hurt 
yourself,

2455
01:56:48,661 --> 01:56:50,640
they'll fucking write you a script for 
that shit.

2456
01:56:50,641 --> 01:56:55,641
easy.
And I have a bunch of friends that got 

2457
01:56:55,641 --> 01:56:55,641
hooked.
I,

2458
01:56:55,641 --> 01:56:57,290
I have a family member that just became 
a loser,

2459
01:56:57,570 --> 01:57:00,470
was a hardworking guy,
had his shit together,

2460
01:57:00,720 --> 01:57:02,610
got hooked on those pills.
Loser.

2461
01:57:02,611 --> 01:57:05,370
Now no one talks to them.
He's just gone his own fucking kids.

2462
01:57:05,371 --> 01:57:06,990
Don't talk to them.
Gone.

2463
01:57:07,440 --> 01:57:09,030
And um,
my buddy brendan,

2464
01:57:09,031 --> 01:57:11,070
he broke his nose.
They had them on that shit.

2465
01:57:11,071 --> 01:57:12,780
And then three months later he's taking 
it every day,

2466
01:57:12,781 --> 01:57:15,870
still his friends had come over his 
house and scoop it up out of his,

2467
01:57:15,871 --> 01:57:18,050
um,
out of is a medicine cabinet.

2468
01:57:18,060 --> 01:57:19,410
Addictive,
scary stuff.

2469
01:57:19,500 --> 01:57:22,530
Scary.
And then you just need it.

2470
01:57:22,590 --> 01:57:24,200
You just need it.
I'll get,

2471
01:57:24,210 --> 01:57:25,740
I'll get off it eventually,
but right now I need it.

2472
01:57:25,800 --> 01:57:30,800
Oh,
I had my wisdom teeth taken out when I 

2473
01:57:30,800 --> 01:57:32,230
was 17 and I feel like I got addicted to
them that the doctor gave me.

2474
01:57:32,231 --> 01:57:33,080
Yeah,
I loved it.

2475
01:57:33,150 --> 01:57:34,860
How could you not?
I never did it.

2476
01:57:34,950 --> 01:57:35,480
What's?
Yeah,

2477
01:57:35,510 --> 01:57:40,510
I never did it.
I've got a knee surgery once and they 

2478
01:57:40,510 --> 01:57:43,881
gave me something.
It was either percocets or viking and I 

2479
01:57:43,881 --> 01:57:44,130
cannot remember,
but it made me so stupid.

2480
01:57:44,550 --> 01:57:46,770
I remember thinking I would rather be 
pain.

2481
01:57:47,610 --> 01:57:52,610
I'm pretty good with pain,
but I'm not good with anything that 

2482
01:57:52,610 --> 01:57:53,310
makes me feel stupid beCause I feel 
vulnerable.

2483
01:57:53,520 --> 01:57:57,560
Like I'd rather I'd rather be hurting 
and aware than I w I don't know,

2484
01:57:57,570 --> 01:57:59,640
like a numb guy.
I don't like numbing out.

2485
01:57:59,670 --> 01:58:04,670
That's one of the reasons why I like pot
because it makes me hyper aware and 

2486
01:58:04,670 --> 01:58:07,110
hyper vigilant and really sensitive and,
and it makes me,

2487
01:58:07,140 --> 01:58:07,710
you know,
people,

2488
01:58:07,711 --> 01:58:09,750
you can call it paranoid.
Some people call it paranoid,

2489
01:58:09,751 --> 01:58:10,200
but I,
I'm,

2490
01:58:10,250 --> 01:58:13,020
I think it's more like hyperawareness,
you know,

2491
01:58:13,021 --> 01:58:18,021
in that hyper awareness you have to take
into account all the variables that you 

2492
01:58:18,021 --> 01:58:18,120
are going to die,
that you are in a,

2493
01:58:18,540 --> 01:58:23,220
a ball that spinning a thousand miles an
hour with a thin layer of gas,

2494
01:58:23,221 --> 01:58:24,330
flat,
flat,

2495
01:58:24,331 --> 01:58:26,810
flat earth.
No spinning,

2496
01:58:27,340 --> 01:58:28,400
spinning around.
Oh wait,

2497
01:58:28,430 --> 01:58:29,730
just stationery.
Yeah,

2498
01:58:29,740 --> 01:58:33,360
everything's doing something around us.
It's not.

2499
01:58:33,990 --> 01:58:35,610
Whenever I hear the flutter thing,
I'm just like,

2500
01:58:35,611 --> 01:58:40,611
don't ask her not to take photos from 
space now or you can see the earth 

2501
01:58:40,611 --> 01:58:44,151
behind you live.
There's a live you can watch from the 

2502
01:58:44,151 --> 01:58:44,220
space station.
Anybody can soros.

2503
01:58:44,410 --> 01:58:49,410
It's no cgr.
It's a hologram buddy that I talked to 

2504
01:58:49,410 --> 01:58:49,440
you that believes in flutter at the 
show,

2505
01:58:49,630 --> 01:58:51,910
that japanese satellite that takes a 
photo,

2506
01:58:51,911 --> 01:58:55,510
high resolution every 10 minutes from 
22,000

2507
01:58:55,511 --> 01:58:57,250
miles away,
a full picture of the earth.

2508
01:58:57,700 --> 01:59:00,330
They think it's fake.
That's all you have to say.

2509
01:59:00,331 --> 01:59:01,360
It's fake.
By the way.

2510
01:59:01,361 --> 01:59:03,430
They keep saying that you can't fly over
antarctica.

2511
01:59:03,640 --> 01:59:04,660
Listen to me.
You fucks.

2512
01:59:05,110 --> 01:59:08,290
You can fly over antarctica.
Can't fly government.

2513
01:59:08,291 --> 01:59:12,640
Stop you from flying away article.
They don't regularly scheduled flights.

2514
01:59:12,641 --> 01:59:15,100
They fly over antarctica.
Not only that,

2515
01:59:15,101 --> 01:59:19,180
there's a quantas pilot who filmed it 
because he was tired of that bullshit.

2516
01:59:19,800 --> 01:59:24,070
Mic west.
The guy who runs the man who runs metta,

2517
01:59:24,071 --> 01:59:29,071
bunk metabolic is a website designed for
debunking conspiracy theories with facts

2518
01:59:30,581 --> 01:59:32,140
and science.
He's,

2519
01:59:32,180 --> 01:59:37,180
they have many,
many pages on the flat earth on that 

2520
01:59:37,180 --> 01:59:38,980
website of debunking all the arguments 
against flatter it.

2521
01:59:38,990 --> 01:59:41,590
So he's going to come on the website and
we're going to go over them.

2522
01:59:41,890 --> 01:59:44,140
One,
I'm going to die one.

2523
01:59:44,600 --> 01:59:49,600
Some reason it's still growing.
It's because me and my $3 a month that I

2524
01:59:49,901 --> 01:59:51,890
take from george soros,
my,

2525
01:59:51,900 --> 01:59:53,350
um,
my round earth.

2526
01:59:54,860 --> 01:59:59,860
How much you think they get paid you.
If the earth was flat and you knew that 

2527
01:59:59,860 --> 02:00:04,581
the earth was flat,
could they even pay you enough to not 

2528
02:00:04,581 --> 02:00:04,581
tell people?
No.

2529
02:00:04,581 --> 02:00:05,230
No.
There's no way.

2530
02:00:05,260 --> 02:00:10,260
There'd be no way.
Think of how many people you'd have to 

2531
02:00:10,260 --> 02:00:10,930
tell or how many people you'd have to 
keep fire up the moon landing thing.

2532
02:00:10,931 --> 02:00:12,250
Man,
that's a cover up.

2533
02:00:12,251 --> 02:00:17,251
The flutter thing.
The moon landing at least happened in 

2534
02:00:17,251 --> 02:00:20,740
1969 and it happened with a limited 
amount of people that were had access to

2535
02:00:20,741 --> 02:00:22,600
all the technology.
There was no internet.

2536
02:00:23,320 --> 02:00:26,950
They controlled the media and we never 
went back.

2537
02:00:27,130 --> 02:00:32,130
So there's all sorts of beautiful things
connect together to form a nice juicy 

2538
02:00:32,130 --> 02:00:34,930
fat conspiracy that I love.
I love the moon landings.

2539
02:00:35,420 --> 02:00:38,920
I secretly not so secretly covered that 
one.

2540
02:00:38,950 --> 02:00:41,800
Like no other conspiracy.
I would love it if it was true.

2541
02:00:42,010 --> 02:00:42,940
Yeah,
there's a,

2542
02:00:42,970 --> 02:00:45,490
there's a great quote from bill clinton 
from his book,

2543
02:00:45,491 --> 02:00:48,390
my life on the moon landing and it is,
um,

2544
02:00:48,760 --> 02:00:53,760
it's fascinating because he's talking 
about an old carpenter and he says the 

2545
02:00:53,760 --> 02:00:54,330
carpenter says that,
uh,

2546
02:00:54,350 --> 02:00:59,350
them mtv fellers that he didn't believe 
the moon landing and that those tv flow 

2547
02:00:59,350 --> 02:01:02,670
fellows,
I never believe anything because they 

2548
02:01:02,670 --> 02:01:03,580
can pretty much do anything and make you
believe that it's real and you don't.

2549
02:01:03,820 --> 02:01:05,620
He goes,
back then I thought he was a crank,

2550
02:01:05,740 --> 02:01:07,360
but after eight years of the white 
house,

2551
02:01:07,870 --> 02:01:09,760
I was wondering if he's not ahead of his
time.

2552
02:01:10,570 --> 02:01:15,570
That's in bill clinton's book series.
You want to hear something really quick 

2553
02:01:15,570 --> 02:01:15,900
and people are going to go on with the 
moon.

2554
02:01:15,901 --> 02:01:16,450
Moon.
Are you good,

2555
02:01:16,480 --> 02:01:18,010
bro?
I thought you gave up on that.

2556
02:01:18,310 --> 02:01:23,310
I will give you the most cryptic piece 
of information about the moon landing.

2557
02:01:23,770 --> 02:01:28,770
Neil armstrong gave a speech on the 25th
anniversary of the moon landings and it 

2558
02:01:30,601 --> 02:01:35,601
is one of the most what the fuck 
speeches you'll ever hear in your life 

2559
02:01:35,601 --> 02:01:37,360
because it's not a guy saying,
look,

2560
02:01:37,361 --> 02:01:39,150
we went to the moon and it was an 
amazing.

2561
02:01:39,290 --> 02:01:41,360
You kids are going to accomplish amazing
things as well.

2562
02:01:41,840 --> 02:01:46,840
Pull up neil armstrong's cryptics says 
she doesn't remember if there were 

2563
02:01:46,840 --> 02:01:47,200
stars,
no known,

2564
02:01:47,300 --> 02:01:52,300
but that is one of the things that they 
did say it wasn't neil armstrong by the 

2565
02:01:52,300 --> 02:01:55,091
way,
it was Michael Collins had said that 

2566
02:01:55,091 --> 02:01:55,091
Michael Collins said that he didn't 
recall seeing any stars,

2567
02:01:55,091 --> 02:01:59,831
but then later in his book he recalled 
in great depth what the stars looked 

2568
02:02:00,171 --> 02:02:03,650
like and how amazing they were and how 
incredible they were him later.

2569
02:02:03,680 --> 02:02:06,140
But meanwhile he was in the lunar lander
is whole time.

2570
02:02:06,141 --> 02:02:07,340
So play this,
play this

2571
02:02:08,650 --> 02:02:12,040
on the 25th anniversary of the event in 
1994,

2572
02:02:12,520 --> 02:02:17,520
neil armstrong meter rare public 
appearance and held back tears as he 

2573
02:02:17,520 --> 02:02:21,751
spoke.
These brief triptych remarks before the 

2574
02:02:21,751 --> 02:02:22,630
next generation of taxpayers as they 
tour the white house.

2575
02:02:22,660 --> 02:02:23,270
Listen to this

2576
02:02:24,430 --> 02:02:28,400
today.
We have with this group of students some

2577
02:02:28,401 --> 02:02:33,401
on america's best to you.
We say we have only completed a 

2578
02:02:35,111 --> 02:02:39,460
beginning.
We leave you much.

2579
02:02:39,850 --> 02:02:44,020
That is under.
There are great ideas.

2580
02:02:44,021 --> 02:02:49,021
Undiscovered breakthroughs are available
to those who can remove one of truths,

2581
02:02:52,301 --> 02:02:53,440
protective layers.

2582
02:02:57,670 --> 02:03:00,040
Is this a funny thing that happened on 
the way that the moon did?

2583
02:03:00,050 --> 02:03:05,050
That movie is nuts.
When they showed the apollo mission and 

2584
02:03:05,050 --> 02:03:08,221
it shows them like putting the piece of 
paper where it makes it look like 

2585
02:03:08,221 --> 02:03:08,221
they're farther away.
I was like,

2586
02:03:08,221 --> 02:03:08,770
what are they doing?
Yeah,

2587
02:03:08,880 --> 02:03:09,100
have no idea.

2588
02:03:09,400 --> 02:03:14,400
They're filming through a window there,
filming the earth through a circular 

2589
02:03:14,400 --> 02:03:17,700
window and they have the cabin of the 
lunar module blacked out.

2590
02:03:17,701 --> 02:03:22,701
They have all these things over the 
windows like a set and they using 

2591
02:03:22,701 --> 02:03:24,190
diffused lighting to operate the 
controls.

2592
02:03:24,200 --> 02:03:29,200
It's crazy.
It's so strange because it's the one 

2593
02:03:29,200 --> 02:03:31,911
conspiracy that still to this day you go
home because there's no technological 

2594
02:03:32,161 --> 02:03:35,460
achievement from 1969 site easier,
cheaper,

2595
02:03:35,520 --> 02:03:40,520
and faster to reproduce today other than
the moon landing is they went six times 

2596
02:03:40,561 --> 02:03:43,320
seven attempts,
six to successful attempts.

2597
02:03:43,830 --> 02:03:45,930
Apollo 13,
obviously they never went.

2598
02:03:46,350 --> 02:03:49,590
They did that accident that made tom 
hanks great movie,

2599
02:03:50,040 --> 02:03:55,040
but that was the only time human beings 
have been more than 400 miles from the 

2600
02:03:55,441 --> 02:03:58,870
earth's surface.
Every other gun back.

2601
02:03:58,950 --> 02:04:00,150
Not only,
we haven't gone back,

2602
02:04:00,151 --> 02:04:02,580
we never even left the magnetosphere.
It's crazy.

2603
02:04:02,610 --> 02:04:05,250
We've never gone through the van allen 
radiation belts since then.

2604
02:04:06,090 --> 02:04:11,090
We never went into deep space like all 
the way out and back like around the 

2605
02:04:11,090 --> 02:04:14,280
Moon.
They never even did like a fly by since 

2606
02:04:14,280 --> 02:04:16,011
then.
That's insane how much it costs a 

2607
02:04:16,011 --> 02:04:16,350
shitload of money,
but so does the space shuttle.

2608
02:04:16,890 --> 02:04:19,560
So does the space station,
so does a lot of things.

2609
02:04:20,010 --> 02:04:22,170
He does cost a lot of money and that is 
a good argument,

2610
02:04:22,200 --> 02:04:25,380
but it is weird that we still had a 
space program from it.

2611
02:04:25,381 --> 02:04:26,000
This,
it's like,

2612
02:04:26,070 --> 02:04:27,450
look,
I'm not saying that we didn't go,

2613
02:04:27,451 --> 02:04:30,520
but what I am saying is that,
that is why that conspiracy.

2614
02:04:30,800 --> 02:04:31,340
Totally.
No,

2615
02:04:31,341 --> 02:04:36,341
It's super crazy and that movie you can 
kind of go through and debunk the 

2616
02:04:36,341 --> 02:04:36,680
lighting stuff,
the stars,

2617
02:04:36,681 --> 02:04:38,070
the van allen radiation belt thing,

2618
02:04:38,070 --> 02:04:39,530
but then when it gets to that end 
senior,

2619
02:04:39,540 --> 02:04:41,710
like,
what the hell is going on there?

2620
02:04:41,770 --> 02:04:43,770
It's nuts.
It reAlly is creepy with that guy.

2621
02:04:45,330 --> 02:04:46,980
He's very compelling.
He was,

2622
02:04:47,190 --> 02:04:52,190
he was all in that guy.
The guy who made that movie funny thing 

2623
02:04:52,190 --> 02:04:55,461
happened on the way to the moon.
This was when I was deep in the whole 

2624
02:04:55,461 --> 02:04:55,780
moon landing thing.
Um,

2625
02:04:55,800 --> 02:05:00,800
but there was a first one that got me is
when I was on news radio in the 

2626
02:05:00,800 --> 02:05:05,610
nineties.
They had a documentary on fox called 

2627
02:05:05,610 --> 02:05:06,750
conspiracy theory.
Did we ever go to the moon?

2628
02:05:07,020 --> 02:05:12,020
And that one is really compelling and 
one of the reasons why it's compelling 

2629
02:05:12,020 --> 02:05:15,461
us because there's more than one 
occasion where they used the exact same 

2630
02:05:15,461 --> 02:05:17,130
backdrop.
They have the same backdrop,

2631
02:05:17,131 --> 02:05:22,131
but they were supposed to be on a 
totally different part of the moon and 

2632
02:05:22,131 --> 02:05:22,920
they had the exact same background where
it looks fake as fuck.

2633
02:05:23,630 --> 02:05:28,630
You want to see something really fake 
looking google astronauts on 

2634
02:05:28,630 --> 02:05:28,980
trampolines.
You want to see some ridiculous shit.

2635
02:05:29,400 --> 02:05:34,400
There's one one video clip did they did.
Now here's what someone explained to me 

2636
02:05:34,400 --> 02:05:36,960
that it's entirely likely,
and this made a lot of sense,

2637
02:05:37,170 --> 02:05:39,720
that it's entirely likely.
This is during the nixon administration,

2638
02:05:39,721 --> 02:05:40,830
by the way.
It was all going on.

2639
02:05:40,831 --> 02:05:43,890
Massive deception.
I mean nixon was just a fucking fraud in

2640
02:05:43,891 --> 02:05:46,620
every way,
shape or form and a crook and a liar.

2641
02:05:47,400 --> 02:05:52,400
that it's entirely possible that they 
filmed a lot of stuff and that they 

2642
02:05:52,831 --> 02:05:56,670
filmed all this fake stuff and they 
passed it off as the real footage,

2643
02:05:56,790 --> 02:06:00,060
but that they actually did go,
but they couldn't get footage of it.

2644
02:06:00,270 --> 02:06:02,330
And one of the reasons why they probably
couldn't get footage of it,

2645
02:06:02,370 --> 02:06:07,370
if that's the case,
is that you can't even get that fucking 

2646
02:06:07,370 --> 02:06:08,070
film through the radar detector at the 
airport or the,

2647
02:06:08,430 --> 02:06:09,170
the,
um,

2648
02:06:09,210 --> 02:06:11,820
the x ray machine at the airport without
killing it.

2649
02:06:11,820 --> 02:06:16,820
Right.
I was looking at some stuff up on this 

2650
02:06:16,820 --> 02:06:16,820
the other day,
the van van van allen radiation belts,

2651
02:06:17,700 --> 02:06:22,700
the spaceship itself and all the stuff 
they were wearing would've protected 

2652
02:06:22,700 --> 02:06:26,151
them from most of the radiation that 
would have potentially harmed them or 

2653
02:06:26,151 --> 02:06:26,550
anything that allegedly.
And it's,

2654
02:06:26,620 --> 02:06:31,620
it's uh,
they also didn't go through what they 

2655
02:06:31,620 --> 02:06:31,620
went through,
like the donut hole that's at the top.

2656
02:06:31,620 --> 02:06:34,230
Like the way the van allen radiation 
belts apparently surrounded the earth.

2657
02:06:34,530 --> 02:06:39,530
It surrounds it like a doughnut.
So there's an area where you can go 

2658
02:06:39,530 --> 02:06:39,530
through.
Yeah,

2659
02:06:39,530 --> 02:06:39,530
yeah,
yeah.

2660
02:06:39,530 --> 02:06:40,260
Well there's an area where you can go 
through with.

2661
02:06:40,261 --> 02:06:43,470
They're only exposed to the radiation 
for like an hour or something like that.

2662
02:06:43,590 --> 02:06:48,590
How,
I mean with all this deception back in 

2663
02:06:48,590 --> 02:06:49,740
started from the beginning,
look at this.

2664
02:06:50,490 --> 02:06:51,840
So this is.

2665
02:06:54,660 --> 02:06:59,660
This is when I was balls deep,
but look at this footage like what is 

2666
02:07:00,121 --> 02:07:02,400
going on here?
Like what is this guy doing?

2667
02:07:02,520 --> 02:07:06,640
So here's the thing,
the physics back then they're.

2668
02:07:06,650 --> 02:07:11,340
They're not the same on every mission,
like the way they move around.

2669
02:07:11,341 --> 02:07:16,341
It's not the same amount of palo 11 as 
it is on apollo 16 or whatever the last 

2670
02:07:16,341 --> 02:07:18,360
mission was that it looks different when
they're moving around,

2671
02:07:18,660 --> 02:07:21,810
but this one is the weirdest one because
here these guys are,

2672
02:07:21,811 --> 02:07:26,811
they're in one six earth's gravity and 
there's fucking juMping around through 

2673
02:07:26,811 --> 02:07:30,471
the air and you can't see their feet 
like you only see their feet when 

2674
02:07:30,471 --> 02:07:31,200
they're in the air.
They just,

2675
02:07:31,580 --> 02:07:36,580
they were hiding behind this lunar 
module and they're bouncing around in a 

2676
02:07:36,580 --> 02:07:36,580
way that you never saw

2677
02:07:36,580 --> 02:07:39,310
them bounce around before.
That's not in any other moon mission.

2678
02:07:39,940 --> 02:07:44,940
So I think it's entirely Possible that 
they fake some stuff and that there 

2679
02:07:44,940 --> 02:07:47,890
could have been an issue with them being
on the surface of the moon.

2680
02:07:48,140 --> 02:07:53,140
Yeah,
and also being on the surface of the 

2681
02:07:53,140 --> 02:07:54,691
moon,
the radiation on the surface of the 

2682
02:07:54,691 --> 02:07:54,691
moon,
there was no protection to those cameras

2683
02:07:54,691 --> 02:07:55,420
and there's no.
There's no magnetos fear.

2684
02:07:55,421 --> 02:08:00,421
There's nothing.
Those hassled bad cameras that they had 

2685
02:08:00,421 --> 02:08:00,421
that they kept in the center of their 
chests.

2686
02:08:00,421 --> 02:08:01,930
Those weird looking cameras that they 
used.

2687
02:08:02,160 --> 02:08:04,780
There was nothing different about those.
There was nothing protecting,

2688
02:08:05,860 --> 02:08:07,480
protecting us when I was reading.
Yeah,

2689
02:08:07,481 --> 02:08:09,630
but not the camera.
The camera was external.

2690
02:08:09,700 --> 02:08:11,590
It was in the suit.
This external.

2691
02:08:11,830 --> 02:08:13,630
It was like this.
It was out in front of them.

2692
02:08:13,690 --> 02:08:14,380
Well,
I don't know man.

2693
02:08:14,381 --> 02:08:17,890
I just read that the pentagon spent like
half a billion dollars on just fake isis

2694
02:08:17,891 --> 02:08:21,760
videos and propaganda videos for 
terrorist recruitment.

2695
02:08:21,760 --> 02:08:23,140
What do you know why they did that 
though?

2696
02:08:23,230 --> 02:08:28,230
That's.
That's something that people bring up a 

2697
02:08:28,230 --> 02:08:28,230
lot,
but it's a little misleading.

2698
02:08:28,230 --> 02:08:32,220
what they did was they made these videos
for real player and so when someone 

2699
02:08:32,220 --> 02:08:35,200
would watch these videos,
they would collect metadata,

2700
02:08:35,201 --> 02:08:40,201
so location the person was watching and 
that way they could find out who is 

2701
02:08:40,201 --> 02:08:42,370
watching these terrorists recruitment 
videos and they get it.

2702
02:08:42,820 --> 02:08:43,630
You're right,
you're right,

2703
02:08:43,660 --> 02:08:48,660
but so is everything the government does
and like if they want to try to figure 

2704
02:08:48,660 --> 02:08:49,390
out where isis was,
they have unlimited money.

2705
02:08:49,840 --> 02:08:51,640
I mean they can kind of do whatever the 
fuck they want.

2706
02:08:51,641 --> 02:08:52,150
someone said,
hey,

2707
02:08:52,151 --> 02:08:57,151
I've got an idea.
We'll make these videos while these 

2708
02:08:57,151 --> 02:08:58,740
terrorist recruitment videos and 
everything like that.

2709
02:08:58,770 --> 02:09:00,340
The garland,
Texas,

2710
02:09:00,390 --> 02:09:05,390
um,
that first isis attack and the us was 

2711
02:09:05,390 --> 02:09:08,101
really an fba.
Once again it was an fbi informant to 

2712
02:09:08,101 --> 02:09:08,101
fbi informants were on the scene.

2713
02:09:08,101 --> 02:09:10,000
Why didn't they stop the attack ballou 
it guys.

2714
02:09:10,050 --> 02:09:10,950
Right,
right.

2715
02:09:11,020 --> 02:09:11,920
Well,
here's a better one,

2716
02:09:11,950 --> 02:09:16,950
but they do all the time.
How about that video that we were 

2717
02:09:16,950 --> 02:09:20,140
supposed to be led to believe was the 
reason why they attack bengazi?

2718
02:09:20,470 --> 02:09:22,580
Remember that you remember?
Oh yeah.

2719
02:09:22,581 --> 02:09:25,480
I remember that fake video that was 
like,

2720
02:09:26,270 --> 02:09:31,270
that was about the movie and everybody 
was saying everybody was saying that 

2721
02:09:31,270 --> 02:09:32,350
that movie was the reason why they 
attacked us,

2722
02:09:32,740 --> 02:09:34,570
which was a lie.
They knew it was a lot.

2723
02:09:34,660 --> 02:09:38,440
They had a cia operation running weapons
out of this hub,

2724
02:09:38,500 --> 02:09:39,040
but they're like,
oh,

2725
02:09:39,041 --> 02:09:41,310
it's about a movie.
Everyone hates this movie.

2726
02:09:41,930 --> 02:09:44,140
Youtube.
You're watched the movie now.

2727
02:09:44,230 --> 02:09:46,730
It's fucking unbelievably bad.
Oh god.

2728
02:09:46,750 --> 02:09:48,940
I'm so bad that you don't even believe 
it's real movement.

2729
02:09:48,941 --> 02:09:52,090
Seems like create that movie too.
I would guess so.

2730
02:09:52,540 --> 02:09:54,340
I don't know,
but I would say probably.

2731
02:09:55,090 --> 02:09:56,410
I would say,
yeah,

2732
02:09:56,411 --> 02:09:59,170
I would guess thing that bothers me 
about the isis stuff is that,

2733
02:09:59,200 --> 02:10:00,940
like I said before,
that 70,000

2734
02:10:00,941 --> 02:10:05,941
number.
It's like you could just say anything's 

2735
02:10:05,941 --> 02:10:07,711
isis.
Isis gigs that we dropped them moab on 

2736
02:10:07,711 --> 02:10:07,711
and it's just like,
oh,

2737
02:10:07,711 --> 02:10:10,030
it's the nicest cave and that's why 70 
percent of americans support bombing the

2738
02:10:10,031 --> 02:10:12,460
shit out of Afghanistan because isis was
there.

2739
02:10:12,760 --> 02:10:17,760
What happened?
I felt like there was more critical 

2740
02:10:17,760 --> 02:10:17,760
thinking that people were upset that we 
were playing judge,

2741
02:10:17,760 --> 02:10:22,140
jury and executioner.
I think now we just kill isis and mass 

2742
02:10:22,140 --> 02:10:22,140
and it's just no one questioned that at 
all.

2743
02:10:22,140 --> 02:10:23,560
I think it's like what we were talking 
about earlier.

2744
02:10:23,561 --> 02:10:28,561
There's just too much information.
There's too much going on and the they 

2745
02:10:28,561 --> 02:10:32,401
bombed.
They drop the mother of all bombs right 

2746
02:10:32,401 --> 02:10:34,070
after we had accidentally killed a bunch
of people

2747
02:10:34,070 --> 02:10:36,410
that were on our side in Syria.
Right?

2748
02:10:36,470 --> 02:10:37,530
Yep.
So like,

2749
02:10:37,580 --> 02:10:42,580
that was like a good time,
like we had accidentally fucked up and 

2750
02:10:42,580 --> 02:10:43,240
killed some syrian rebels and like,
ooh,

2751
02:10:43,360 --> 02:10:44,800
didn't he kill it?
Yeah.

2752
02:10:44,890 --> 02:10:49,890
We killed a bunch of people that we were
training in arming alqaeda and sees 

2753
02:10:49,890 --> 02:10:50,320
trump.
And you know,

2754
02:10:50,321 --> 02:10:52,180
what trump learned after the Syria 
strike,

2755
02:10:52,181 --> 02:10:54,010
he learned that he can get because all 
he cares about,

2756
02:10:54,011 --> 02:10:56,770
he's like a little child wants positive 
reinforcement and he hates,

2757
02:10:56,771 --> 02:10:58,030
you know,
the fake news.

2758
02:10:58,031 --> 02:10:58,930
Cnn,
why don't you,

2759
02:10:59,080 --> 02:11:04,080
why don't you cover me fairly.
He goeS out there and does these press 

2760
02:11:04,080 --> 02:11:06,841
conferences begging the news to cover 
him better because that's all he cares 

2761
02:11:06,841 --> 02:11:09,841
about.
But that's what he learned is that he 

2762
02:11:09,841 --> 02:11:11,521
can get bipartisan support and praise 
from the media if you just bombed the 

2763
02:11:11,521 --> 02:11:12,550
shit out of people.
So that's what he learns.

2764
02:11:12,551 --> 02:11:14,590
So then he dropped the moab and what's 
next?

2765
02:11:14,591 --> 02:11:16,720
Trump.
Because you know now how to be popular,

2766
02:11:16,900 --> 02:11:21,900
just like reagan came in and was,
was seen as a joke until he got swept 

2767
02:11:21,900 --> 02:11:25,651
into the military industrial complex and
became a war president and I think that 

2768
02:11:25,651 --> 02:11:29,401
trump came in as a reality star 
president joke and he's surrounded 

2769
02:11:29,401 --> 02:11:33,391
himself with more generals than any 
other president since world war ii and 

2770
02:11:33,391 --> 02:11:35,580
he's just letting them lead him wherever
they want and,

2771
02:11:35,600 --> 02:11:40,600
and of course general just want to be in
charge of of conflicts so they can get 

2772
02:11:40,600 --> 02:11:43,970
more stars and emblems and honors and 
lead us into different things.

2773
02:11:44,960 --> 02:11:46,900
That's theIr career to bring this up 
earlier.

2774
02:11:46,901 --> 02:11:47,530
But I forgot

2775
02:11:48,890 --> 02:11:51,800
that was one of the things that was most
creepy is that he's saying he's going to

2776
02:11:51,801 --> 02:11:53,900
let the military do their job.
Like,

2777
02:11:53,901 --> 02:11:58,070
like oversight of the military is what 
eisenhower warned us about at the end of

2778
02:11:58,071 --> 02:11:59,180
his term.
I mean,

2779
02:11:59,210 --> 02:12:04,210
remember when eisenhower was leaving,
he talked about the military industrial 

2780
02:12:04,210 --> 02:12:04,430
complex and everybody's like,
what the fuck?

2781
02:12:04,730 --> 02:12:09,730
But that was something that was 
broadcast on television and back in the 

2782
02:12:09,730 --> 02:12:10,580
day,
that's when it ended.

2783
02:12:10,610 --> 02:12:15,610
It was broadcast on tv.
Some people listened and then business 

2784
02:12:15,610 --> 02:12:18,851
went about as usual and it wasn't like 
today where you could watch that video 

2785
02:12:18,851 --> 02:12:20,300
over and over again.
When you see that video,

2786
02:12:20,360 --> 02:12:23,810
eisenhower saying military,
we are industrial complex.

2787
02:12:24,260 --> 02:12:24,620
Yeah.

2788
02:12:24,720 --> 02:12:27,390
Trump is now adding 10 percent of the 
fucking budget,

2789
02:12:27,391 --> 02:12:30,330
cutting all of these agencies and 
bolstering the pentagon even more.

2790
02:12:30,331 --> 02:12:32,640
We already have the biggest military in 
the goddamn world.

2791
02:12:32,641 --> 02:12:34,200
Bigger than the next 10 countries 
combined.

2792
02:12:34,201 --> 02:12:36,480
Why is this happening?
This is whAt makes America great.

2793
02:12:36,840 --> 02:12:40,890
Just reverting back to like a completely
disgusting.

2794
02:12:41,070 --> 02:12:42,030
It's sick,
man.

2795
02:12:42,100 --> 02:12:43,120
What do we do,
abby martin,

2796
02:12:43,300 --> 02:12:44,800
what do we do?
Well,

2797
02:12:44,830 --> 02:12:47,080
okay,
if president abby gets selected,

2798
02:12:47,500 --> 02:12:48,130
what do we do?

2799
02:12:48,510 --> 02:12:49,260
Well,
first,

2800
02:12:49,261 --> 02:12:51,780
uh,
abolish money in politics and start some

2801
02:12:51,781 --> 02:12:56,781
sort of true democratic representation 
where you have simple laws to prosecute 

2802
02:12:56,781 --> 02:13:01,070
criminals.
Whether or not they have money or 

2803
02:13:01,070 --> 02:13:01,070
they're billionaires.
So if you're a corporate criminal,

2804
02:13:01,070 --> 02:13:04,671
you got to fucking jail.
If you pull it sounds like suicide by 

2805
02:13:07,170 --> 02:13:09,420
government.
it's sick,

2806
02:13:09,421 --> 02:13:09,940
man.
I mean,

2807
02:13:10,060 --> 02:13:10,860
I,
yeah,

2808
02:13:10,861 --> 02:13:11,910
it's,
it's hard to say,

2809
02:13:11,911 --> 02:13:16,911
but I just know that trump has taken us 
down a very dangerous path and these 

2810
02:13:16,911 --> 02:13:17,100
people who are thinking that he's 
somehow anti empire,

2811
02:13:17,101 --> 02:13:20,580
andy deep state are very confuse.
Bannon iS a psycho.

2812
02:13:20,581 --> 02:13:22,710
Bannon wants war,
he wants war with China,

2813
02:13:22,870 --> 02:13:27,870
but it's naomi outs know the,
I think that's just on paper because 

2814
02:13:27,870 --> 02:13:31,251
trump didn't like people calling him 
president bannon and so he's still 

2815
02:13:31,251 --> 02:13:31,830
attending the national security council.
He still has a say.

2816
02:13:31,831 --> 02:13:35,310
We know that he really is him and these 
billionaires,

2817
02:13:35,311 --> 02:13:38,310
Robert Mercer in the koch brothers who 
have somehow aren't globalists,

2818
02:13:38,311 --> 02:13:43,311
right?
But they really are backing bannon and 

2819
02:13:43,311 --> 02:13:43,311
trump and they,
uh,

2820
02:13:43,311 --> 02:13:44,790
they hedge their bets band and tried to 
do it before with pailin,

2821
02:13:44,791 --> 02:13:49,791
but it didn't work.
he saw sarah pailin is like the trump 

2822
02:13:49,791 --> 02:13:53,301
one point zero and made this giant movie
about her and try to latch onto her and 

2823
02:13:53,301 --> 02:13:54,130
then she flopped.
She saw,

2824
02:13:54,230 --> 02:13:58,680
sure what with pailin with ted nugent,

2825
02:13:59,050 --> 02:14:02,260
ted nugent's wife and kid rock and kid 
friendly.

2826
02:14:02,400 --> 02:14:04,830
So creepy.
Trump in the oval.

2827
02:14:05,850 --> 02:14:10,850
This is idiocracy idiocracy.
It's like a fucking bass pro shop video,

2828
02:14:12,760 --> 02:14:15,700
a photo from a cabela's catalog.
I mean,

2829
02:14:15,701 --> 02:14:20,701
it's hilarious when you look at the five
of them next to trump and when you were 

2830
02:14:20,701 --> 02:14:25,441
saying the military do your job,
he's already like changed the rules of 

2831
02:14:25,441 --> 02:14:27,850
engagement where we look for kIlling a 
thousand civilians to be killed.

2832
02:14:27,851 --> 02:14:29,080
A thousand civilians in martin.

2833
02:14:29,600 --> 02:14:30,890
Look at this.
Yeah.

2834
02:14:31,640 --> 02:14:36,640
Yup.
Carpet bombed and area and mozal a 

2835
02:14:36,640 --> 02:14:38,841
couple of weeks ago killed 230 people.
Didn't hear a peep about it from the 

2836
02:14:38,841 --> 02:14:38,970
mainstream media.
Let's just move onto the next one.

2837
02:14:39,480 --> 02:14:40,850
The photo then.
Look,

2838
02:14:40,860 --> 02:14:43,470
this is what's happening,
but seriously,

2839
02:14:43,830 --> 02:14:46,500
kid rock's girlfriends hot.
She's hot as fuck.

2840
02:14:47,100 --> 02:14:49,830
Kudos kid.
You're hotter than I than him.

2841
02:14:49,831 --> 02:14:50,100
That's great.

2842
02:14:50,290 --> 02:14:51,400
Sure.
Of course.

2843
02:14:51,820 --> 02:14:53,250
Where does this fear of pailin?
Husband?

2844
02:14:53,350 --> 02:14:54,120
No.
Is that good?

2845
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:56,480
I don't even know what the hell he looks
like.

2846
02:14:56,481 --> 02:14:57,990
You don't know what it looks like.
No,

2847
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:03,000
I don't want quarterly out of my 
periphery like I don't got a good 

2848
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:03,000
hunting show.
Sarah,

2849
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:04,840
sarah dinner kid.
Just have another baby.

2850
02:15:06,320 --> 02:15:08,320
That was her fault.
Abby.

2851
02:15:08,680 --> 02:15:11,480
Maybe one day you'll have promiscuous 
daughters and you'll understand,

2852
02:15:11,490 --> 02:15:12,150
won't be promoted.

2853
02:15:13,720 --> 02:15:16,330
What's it called?
Like how she's just a whole like,

2854
02:15:16,331 --> 02:15:16,900
uh,
she,

2855
02:15:17,060 --> 02:15:18,400
she praises don't have sex

2856
02:15:19,120 --> 02:15:21,100
obstinance thing or who you're talking 
about.

2857
02:15:21,101 --> 02:15:22,540
There was promoting.
Pray the gay away.

2858
02:15:22,541 --> 02:15:24,160
Was that pence?
Yes.

2859
02:15:25,090 --> 02:15:26,500
Pray the gay away.
That's a,

2860
02:15:26,680 --> 02:15:29,350
that's a good sign that someone's trying
to fuck dudes.

2861
02:15:29,650 --> 02:15:31,060
Oh,
for sure.

2862
02:15:31,120 --> 02:15:32,290
Right?
For sure.

2863
02:15:32,320 --> 02:15:35,380
I'm michele bachmann and her husband,
everyone's forgot about her.

2864
02:15:35,860 --> 02:15:40,860
I remember her husband who is maybe the 
gay guy that's ever walked the face of 

2865
02:15:40,860 --> 02:15:41,980
the planet.
So gay guy comes glitter.

2866
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:42,600
Oh,
gay.

2867
02:15:42,920 --> 02:15:45,970
Like glitter and shoots out of his dick 
number.

2868
02:15:45,971 --> 02:15:46,730
Last time I was,
and

2869
02:15:46,740 --> 02:15:51,740
you showed me that dennis prager video,
which was that it was an argument about 

2870
02:15:51,740 --> 02:15:54,720
Israel where he was talking about why 
Israel deserves to exist and stuff after

2871
02:15:54,721 --> 02:15:55,590
being there.
Man.

2872
02:15:55,620 --> 02:15:58,710
Holy shit.
I feel like people have no idea what.

2873
02:15:58,740 --> 02:16:03,740
I didn't even know what the hell is 
going on until I went to palestine and 

2874
02:16:03,740 --> 02:16:03,740
saw how crazy it was.
But what is it like?

2875
02:16:03,740 --> 02:16:08,270
Tell me,
give me your thoughts and your 

2876
02:16:08,270 --> 02:16:09,180
mistakenly thinks that hamas like 
controls palestine.

2877
02:16:09,210 --> 02:16:10,590
That's not true at all.
There's,

2878
02:16:10,620 --> 02:16:14,100
there's three different areas that were 
drawn up with the original partition.

2879
02:16:14,101 --> 02:16:19,101
It's the west bank,
which is totally under military rule by 

2880
02:16:19,101 --> 02:16:20,430
Israel,
and then there's the gaza strip,

2881
02:16:20,431 --> 02:16:25,431
which is like the open air prison,
which they bombed the shit out of like 

2882
02:16:25,431 --> 02:16:26,130
every couple of years and hamas controls
that area.

2883
02:16:26,310 --> 02:16:28,680
And then there's jerusalem,
which is an international city center,

2884
02:16:29,120 --> 02:16:30,910
um,
that both arabs and jews live in.

2885
02:16:30,910 --> 02:16:34,510
But the westbank has been occupied 
militarily since 1967.

2886
02:16:34,511 --> 02:16:36,970
And it's complete martial law.
There's checkpoints.

2887
02:16:37,900 --> 02:16:40,600
All political parties are illegal.
You can't.

2888
02:16:40,900 --> 02:16:43,990
having a gun is like the least of it.
You can't hold a flag.

2889
02:16:44,020 --> 02:16:49,020
You can't belong to a political party.
You literally can't do shit if you're a 

2890
02:16:49,020 --> 02:16:52,681
palestinian.
You just have to sit there and submit 

2891
02:16:52,681 --> 02:16:55,240
'em.
And if even if you share a photo of 

2892
02:16:55,240 --> 02:16:55,240
someone who was killed by an israeli 
soldier,

2893
02:16:55,240 --> 02:16:56,630
you go to jail and you go to jail for 
the amount of,

2894
02:16:56,631 --> 02:16:58,180
like months that.
Yeah,

2895
02:16:58,360 --> 02:17:00,220
based on the shares and likes of the 
photo,

2896
02:17:00,221 --> 02:17:02,110
they'll,
they'll penalize you more and put you in

2897
02:17:02,111 --> 02:17:03,610
prison for longer and longer.
I mean,

2898
02:17:03,650 --> 02:17:06,680
I'll just tell you one story.
Put a photo on social media like you put

2899
02:17:06,710 --> 02:17:11,710
someone who died and there'll be like,
you're sharing a martyr and inciting 

2900
02:17:11,710 --> 02:17:11,710
people to like commit suicide.

2901
02:17:11,710 --> 02:17:16,200
Like on behalf of palestinians.
You go to jail and they put them in 

2902
02:17:16,200 --> 02:17:19,231
jail.
There's a 99 point seven percent 

2903
02:17:19,231 --> 02:17:19,231
conviction rate.
Kids are tortured,

2904
02:17:19,231 --> 02:17:21,280
kids are in prison.
It is absolutely insane.

2905
02:17:21,281 --> 02:17:23,560
We went to the first day that we were 
there,

2906
02:17:24,010 --> 02:17:29,010
we went to a funeral of some guy,
some farmer who was shot by israeli 

2907
02:17:29,010 --> 02:17:29,080
forces and we went to the funeral is 
horrible,

2908
02:17:29,081 --> 02:17:31,540
you know,
all the women are wailing and crying and

2909
02:17:32,410 --> 02:17:37,410
as relieving the israeli forces had set 
up a checkpoint right outside of this 

2910
02:17:37,410 --> 02:17:39,760
dude's house and started tear gassing 
and shooting rubber bullets.

2911
02:17:39,761 --> 02:17:44,761
I get people who were simply attending 
the funeral just to punish people for 

2912
02:17:44,761 --> 02:17:45,330
attending the funeral.
Um,

2913
02:17:45,340 --> 02:17:48,070
we went to another girl's house named 
[inaudible] who's a,

2914
02:17:48,370 --> 02:17:53,370
who got shot in the vagina for 
peacefully protesting at some protests 

2915
02:17:54,221 --> 02:17:55,810
and they shot,
they shot,

2916
02:17:55,840 --> 02:17:57,610
they shot 200 people that day.

2917
02:17:57,640 --> 02:18:00,220
One guy next to her diet,
another guy who was paralyzed,

2918
02:18:00,580 --> 02:18:05,580
they have a policy called shoot to 
cripple where they shoot guys in the 

2919
02:18:05,580 --> 02:18:06,700
dicks is fucking nuts,
man.

2920
02:18:06,730 --> 02:18:11,730
The west bank is no joke.
I thought that I was going to die 

2921
02:18:11,730 --> 02:18:11,730
several times.
We were at this checkpoint going through

2922
02:18:11,730 --> 02:18:16,291
calandria and there was this old man 
walking like clearly drunk or something 

2923
02:18:16,291 --> 02:18:17,270
and kind of walking a little bit toward 
the checkbook.

2924
02:18:17,290 --> 02:18:20,560
They started shooting at him.
Bolts are ricocheting off the thing.

2925
02:18:21,250 --> 02:18:22,630
And I,
you know,

2926
02:18:22,631 --> 02:18:26,320
my partner mike who was an invading 
soldier of Iraq was just like,

2927
02:18:26,321 --> 02:18:27,910
we're gonna die like they're shooting 
this guy,

2928
02:18:27,911 --> 02:18:29,130
there's bullets ricocheted.
I.

2929
02:18:29,140 --> 02:18:31,960
It was absolutely insane.
And as we go through the checkpoint,

2930
02:18:31,961 --> 02:18:32,620
the soldiers like,
hey,

2931
02:18:32,621 --> 02:18:35,140
stay safe out there.
And I was like,

2932
02:18:35,141 --> 02:18:40,141
yeah,
when you guys are arbitrarily shooting 

2933
02:18:40,141 --> 02:18:40,141
people.
And,

2934
02:18:40,141 --> 02:18:43,631
and the person who was driving us had 
just told us that a couple months prior 

2935
02:18:43,631 --> 02:18:44,380
to that,
some woman,

2936
02:18:44,381 --> 02:18:46,270
palestinian woman,
because you can't go to jerusalem,

2937
02:18:46,271 --> 02:18:51,271
like if you're a palestinian,
there's barely any palestinians were 

2938
02:18:51,271 --> 02:18:51,271
even allowed to go pray at the most holy
site,

2939
02:18:51,271 --> 02:18:53,620
the dome of the rock and jerusalem,
you can't go to the beach,

2940
02:18:53,621 --> 02:18:56,680
you're just completely constricted in a 
prison and you can't travel.

2941
02:18:56,680 --> 02:19:01,680
And,
and he was just telling us that months 

2942
02:19:01,680 --> 02:19:01,680
before we went through this checkpoint,
someone was going through the checkpoint

2943
02:19:01,680 --> 02:19:02,230
because they got a permit to go into 
jerusalem,

2944
02:19:02,231 --> 02:19:06,190
which is like a lifetime golden ticket,
like willy wonka and they're walking and

2945
02:19:06,191 --> 02:19:08,820
they get and she just got executed.
And then yeah,

2946
02:19:08,860 --> 02:19:11,650
she just got executed and she was 
bleeding out at this checkpoint.

2947
02:19:11,651 --> 02:19:14,350
And her little brother tried to help her
and they shot him too.

2948
02:19:14,351 --> 02:19:16,930
And they're like hiding the video of 
this.

2949
02:19:16,931 --> 02:19:21,931
And this is just a day because they 
fucking hate palestinians and 

2950
02:19:21,931 --> 02:19:21,931
palestinians are our animals to these 
people.

2951
02:19:21,931 --> 02:19:22,570
It's sick,
man.

2952
02:19:22,750 --> 02:19:24,940
It's sick.
It's really,

2953
02:19:24,941 --> 02:19:26,150
really sick.
Joe and I,

2954
02:19:26,200 --> 02:19:31,200
I couldn't even get into.
We were banned from going into this 

2955
02:19:31,200 --> 02:19:33,761
territory because I was told by the 
israeli government that I was a 

2956
02:19:33,761 --> 02:19:37,151
propagandist and that I was like an 
enemy agent and so I wasn't allowed to 

2957
02:19:37,151 --> 02:19:38,510
go into gaza,
so gaza's hell,

2958
02:19:38,511 --> 02:19:43,511
but the west bank is an under martial 
law and everything's illegal and you 

2959
02:19:43,511 --> 02:19:44,600
can't do a goddamn thing and it's super 
cool.

2960
02:19:44,600 --> 02:19:47,210
Like we went to this place called ramola
that was just like,

2961
02:19:47,211 --> 02:19:49,340
um,
oakland and where they're smoking weed,

2962
02:19:50,030 --> 02:19:51,860
there's like openly gay people.
They're like,

2963
02:19:51,861 --> 02:19:55,400
it's just completely different than what
people think of palestine.

2964
02:19:55,550 --> 02:20:00,550
You know,
people think of it as just a bunch of 

2965
02:20:00,550 --> 02:20:00,750
people with turbans on blown and hamas 
is like,

2966
02:20:00,770 --> 02:20:03,740
yo,
you elected hamas and hamas doesn't want

2967
02:20:03,741 --> 02:20:04,580
Israel to exist.
It's like,

2968
02:20:04,581 --> 02:20:09,581
well actually hamas is controlling this 
one area for a reason because it was 

2969
02:20:09,581 --> 02:20:11,690
built as this surplus.
When Israel was created,

2970
02:20:12,020 --> 02:20:16,010
millions of refugees were put miles away
from the homes that they were ethnically

2971
02:20:16,011 --> 02:20:18,830
cleansed from and put into refugee camps
in gaza.

2972
02:20:19,220 --> 02:20:21,800
And when the israeli military wanted 
more and more land,

2973
02:20:22,280 --> 02:20:24,740
by the way,
all settlements in Israel are illegal.

2974
02:20:25,550 --> 02:20:26,990
All of them are illegal in the west 
bank,

2975
02:20:26,991 --> 02:20:31,991
but they just keep creating more and 
more and more and we would go to these 

2976
02:20:31,991 --> 02:20:34,511
villages,
have just arab people living in these 

2977
02:20:34,511 --> 02:20:34,511
villages and the settlers will come.

2978
02:20:34,511 --> 02:20:38,470
You have to be a fanatical fucking 
asshole to move from California to an 

2979
02:20:38,470 --> 02:20:41,630
arab village in palestine and setup a 
goddamn tractor trailer and just live on

2980
02:20:41,631 --> 02:20:45,560
top of their home and they can have a 
giant machine guns.

2981
02:20:45,561 --> 02:20:47,390
They can fire bomb you.
They can shoot you,

2982
02:20:47,391 --> 02:20:49,610
they can beat you up.
They're protected by the state.

2983
02:20:49,611 --> 02:20:51,500
You can go with a tractor trailer,
set up a home.

2984
02:20:52,010 --> 02:20:57,010
The state immediately runs a waterline 
of power line and a military outpost to 

2985
02:20:57,010 --> 02:21:00,911
protect you and the arabs are just 
sitting there waiting to get killed or 

2986
02:21:00,911 --> 02:21:04,751
attacked.
It's absolutely insane and the way home 

2987
02:21:04,751 --> 02:21:08,651
demolitions worker in st louis because 
they either deliver a piece of paper 

2988
02:21:08,651 --> 02:21:09,170
with a rock over it and they're like,
here,

2989
02:21:09,171 --> 02:21:12,080
if you find it good for you and if you 
don't,

2990
02:21:12,081 --> 02:21:14,090
then you're screwed.
And that's if you're lucky.

2991
02:21:14,091 --> 02:21:15,040
If you're not lucky,
you'll just.

2992
02:21:15,050 --> 02:21:19,580
Your home will be invaded by settlers.
And you'll be forced out of your home.

2993
02:21:19,581 --> 02:21:24,581
There's videos of this all over the 
internet of like groups of settlers 

2994
02:21:24,581 --> 02:21:26,870
going and literally taking over arabs 
homes and then they just are forced out.

2995
02:21:27,140 --> 02:21:28,130
It's crazy,
man.

2996
02:21:28,131 --> 02:21:33,131
It's,
it's completely way crazier than I ever 

2997
02:21:33,131 --> 02:21:33,131
could have imagined.
How long were you over there?

2998
02:21:33,131 --> 02:21:33,131
For?
A month.

2999
02:21:33,730 --> 02:21:35,740
Yeah.
Yeah.

3000
02:21:35,750 --> 02:21:36,470
And we were,
you know,

3001
02:21:36,540 --> 02:21:39,140
we were simply and people want to 
quabble about like,

3002
02:21:39,141 --> 02:21:40,120
oh,
it's not apartheid.

3003
02:21:40,130 --> 02:21:42,860
There are different fucking license 
plates for arabs and jews,

3004
02:21:42,861 --> 02:21:47,861
like you cannot go to areas like israeli
soldiers were arbitrarily set up 

3005
02:21:48,351 --> 02:21:51,080
checkpoints in just shut you out of your
neighborhood and force you to walk three

3006
02:21:51,081 --> 02:21:56,081
miles to your home.
Like they can do whatever they want 

3007
02:21:56,081 --> 02:21:56,150
because you are under martial law and 
you can't,

3008
02:21:56,151 --> 02:21:58,310
you have no mobility,
like you have no freedom.

3009
02:21:58,700 --> 02:22:00,290
so it's really,
it's really bad.

3010
02:22:00,410 --> 02:22:05,410
And we just did a whole series on the 
empire files talking about how Israel 

3011
02:22:05,410 --> 02:22:06,320
was created up until today.
And we go over like the settlements,

3012
02:22:06,321 --> 02:22:08,540
the demolitions,
the jail,

3013
02:22:08,541 --> 02:22:12,740
and why I think there's no hope from 
within israeli society to change because

3014
02:22:12,741 --> 02:22:17,741
it's becoming a more theocratic state 
and a more fascist state as it grows 

3015
02:22:17,741 --> 02:22:22,391
because you have to be.
To maintain this jewish supremacist 

3016
02:22:22,391 --> 02:22:25,780
state,
you have to be like more fascist and 

3017
02:22:25,780 --> 02:22:28,781
more controlling and more militaristic 
and the way that you rule society just 

3018
02:22:29,671 --> 02:22:34,671
like the us.
I mean people who are conSidered 

3019
02:22:34,671 --> 02:22:36,531
outlier,
fringe assholes 30 years ago are now 

3020
02:22:36,531 --> 02:22:37,170
like the christian evangelicals are now 
in power.

3021
02:22:38,070 --> 02:22:39,480
It's really,
really crazy.

3022
02:22:39,481 --> 02:22:42,640
I mean it's not the same because Israel 
is a white nationalist,

3023
02:22:43,020 --> 02:22:48,020
ethno supremacist state and you see the 
way that they treat ethiopians and 

3024
02:22:48,930 --> 02:22:53,930
african refugees and,
and it becomes obvious that even if 

3025
02:22:53,930 --> 02:22:56,811
you're a jew and you're black,
you still are a second class citizen 

3026
02:22:56,811 --> 02:22:56,811
there.

3027
02:22:56,811 --> 02:22:59,700
Have you interviewed anybody that's pro 
Israel to interview a lot of israelis?

3028
02:22:59,730 --> 02:23:02,290
And what did you.
I interviewed a lot of israelis.

3029
02:23:02,820 --> 02:23:04,890
It seems like a lot of israelis.
Well,

3030
02:23:04,891 --> 02:23:09,030
think about this in order to really 
reject the notion like you,

3031
02:23:09,031 --> 02:23:12,720
it's like rejecting being an american 
and it's such a hard thing for people to

3032
02:23:12,721 --> 02:23:17,721
really accept.
So there's a huge mobilization within 

3033
02:23:17,721 --> 02:23:20,481
Israel.
People who are opposed to the military 

3034
02:23:20,481 --> 02:23:20,481
who talk openly about how awful the 
occupation is,

3035
02:23:20,481 --> 02:23:21,790
how brutal it is,
how they,

3036
02:23:21,810 --> 02:23:23,280
you know,
all the crimes they committed,

3037
02:23:23,850 --> 02:23:28,850
but you'll very rarely find anti 
zionists who will come out and say that 

3038
02:23:28,850 --> 02:23:32,600
the notion of a jewish state is wrong 
because then it means you're just 

3039
02:23:32,600 --> 02:23:33,650
rejecting everything that you are and 
like,

3040
02:23:33,930 --> 02:23:37,500
who are you then if you're an israeli 
and you are not zionist,

3041
02:23:37,560 --> 02:23:38,910
you know,
it's like,

3042
02:23:38,940 --> 02:23:41,220
it's just a really hard notion for you 
to wrap your mind around.

3043
02:23:41,220 --> 02:23:43,810
But we interviewed about 40 israelis,
man on the streets and,

3044
02:23:43,811 --> 02:23:48,811
and to be leftist as a slur.
So like a lot of israelis don't even 

3045
02:23:48,811 --> 02:23:49,680
entertain the notion of,
oh,

3046
02:23:49,681 --> 02:23:51,480
maybe there shouldn't be an occupation 
at all.

3047
02:23:51,510 --> 02:23:52,410
They're all just like,
okay,

3048
02:23:52,411 --> 02:23:55,290
well maybe we should have a more humane 
occupation.

3049
02:23:55,291 --> 02:24:00,291
Maybe we should give them water.
Like maybe they should have their own 

3050
02:24:00,291 --> 02:24:01,170
water.
Saying the occupation,

3051
02:24:01,350 --> 02:24:06,350
occupation of palestine.
So the west bank of the west bank has 

3052
02:24:06,350 --> 02:24:10,790
been militarily occupied for since 67.
So when Israel was created in 48,

3053
02:24:11,880 --> 02:24:15,060
there were those three partitioned to 
areas that I talked about and ever since

3054
02:24:15,061 --> 02:24:20,061
that happened,
Israel has just continued to take over 

3055
02:24:20,061 --> 02:24:23,091
more and more land in the west bank.
so these settlements just keep growing 

3056
02:24:23,091 --> 02:24:23,091
and growing and growing and growing.
Um,

3057
02:24:23,091 --> 02:24:23,970
and so,
you know,

3058
02:24:23,971 --> 02:24:28,971
over time there was mass resistances 
that happen and then in 67 Israel was 

3059
02:24:28,971 --> 02:24:33,441
like,
we're just gonna do a large scale 

3060
02:24:33,441 --> 02:24:34,551
invasion and try to take over all the 
land and then they just stayed and 

3061
02:24:34,551 --> 02:24:34,551
occupied this area and they just had 
been there ever since.

3062
02:24:34,650 --> 02:24:39,650
And so that's like the huge 
international crime when the 

3063
02:24:39,650 --> 02:24:40,140
international community is like,
by the way these settlements are illegal

3064
02:24:40,141 --> 02:24:45,141
and we're like condemning you at the un 
and the us just vetoes it every time 

3065
02:24:45,141 --> 02:24:47,010
because the us is just like boys with 
Israel unconditionally.

3066
02:24:47,820 --> 02:24:52,820
It's sick man.
And then they just sign that 

3067
02:24:52,820 --> 02:24:54,561
$10,000,000,000
aid package given it to Israel for the 

3068
02:24:54,561 --> 02:24:55,770
next 10 years is I actually,
I think it was $30,000,000,000

3069
02:24:55,771 --> 02:25:00,771
over the next 10 years,
which is crazy because this would never 

3070
02:25:00,771 --> 02:25:02,580
be able to happen if it weren't just 
completely supported by the us.

3071
02:25:02,730 --> 02:25:05,310
And why is this us?
I don't know.

3072
02:25:05,370 --> 02:25:10,370
Um,
I think that the us loves using Israel 

3073
02:25:10,370 --> 02:25:13,101
as a military garrison.
They love usIng that strategic point in 

3074
02:25:13,101 --> 02:25:13,860
the middle east to have.
Um,

3075
02:25:14,640 --> 02:25:17,340
and also someone was shedding some 
light.

3076
02:25:17,370 --> 02:25:19,740
This israeli soldier that I interviewed 
who was amazing,

3077
02:25:19,741 --> 02:25:23,740
his name is ronna ferrante and he was 
telling me that the military aid package

3078
02:25:23,741 --> 02:25:26,440
that we just signed with Israel,
it may look like just a gift.

3079
02:25:26,440 --> 02:25:28,130
Israel were like,
here's $30,000,000,000.

3080
02:25:28,131 --> 02:25:29,650
But he said,
really what it was doing,

3081
02:25:30,100 --> 02:25:35,100
Israel has been its own arms dealer it,
it actually is one of the number number 

3082
02:25:35,100 --> 02:25:38,260
one weapons dealers in the world now.
It actually did like this huge deal with

3083
02:25:38,261 --> 02:25:40,480
India.
And so the us felt threatened,

3084
02:25:40,870 --> 02:25:42,760
right?
Because we're the military might.

3085
02:25:42,761 --> 02:25:45,670
And so we kind of locked in Israel with 
this giant packet and we're like,

3086
02:25:45,671 --> 02:25:48,430
you have to buy us armaments through 
this,

3087
02:25:48,610 --> 02:25:50,890
so if you accept this $30,000,000,000
a deal,

3088
02:25:51,250 --> 02:25:56,250
you have to go through our military like
weapons to buy if you want this money.

3089
02:25:56,681 --> 02:26:01,681
So that's what this guy was saying.
He said it's actually a gift to us that 

3090
02:26:01,681 --> 02:26:05,200
we're locking down like our control over
this country.

3091
02:26:05,800 --> 02:26:10,030
But honestly it's becoming so unpopular.
Obama had a big feud with netanyahu.

3092
02:26:10,031 --> 02:26:15,031
I mean,
trump is disgusting because jared 

3093
02:26:15,031 --> 02:26:15,031
kushner is personally invested in 
illegal settlements.

3094
02:26:15,031 --> 02:26:16,850
And he like his boys with netanyahu 
financial.

3095
02:26:16,950 --> 02:26:19,030
Yeah.
The cushner foundation.

3096
02:26:19,031 --> 02:26:21,600
Like his family,
his actual foundation has funded illegal

3097
02:26:21,640 --> 02:26:26,290
settlements.
But if you fund some charity in gaza,

3098
02:26:26,291 --> 02:26:28,810
you will go to jail for supporting 
terrorism.

3099
02:26:28,811 --> 02:26:33,811
But you can go fund the legal 
settlements and sponsor settlers to go 

3100
02:26:33,811 --> 02:26:35,650
and live on top of arab villages.
And that's fine.

3101
02:26:35,710 --> 02:26:40,710
I guess that's freedom.
Do you think that most people just 

3102
02:26:40,710 --> 02:26:40,710
aren't aware?
Yes.

3103
02:26:40,710 --> 02:26:44,010
I didN't even know.
I had no idea how crazy it wasn't for a 

3104
02:26:44,010 --> 02:26:45,540
while.
and I a pc.

3105
02:26:45,550 --> 02:26:47,530
You were criticized about on your show,
were you,

3106
02:26:48,220 --> 02:26:50,680
you were furious about,
oh my god.

3107
02:26:50,681 --> 02:26:51,760
Yeah,
and people are just,

3108
02:26:51,790 --> 02:26:56,790
it's so confusing and convoluted on 
purpose because that it really relies on

3109
02:26:57,160 --> 02:27:02,160
Israel being the victim and for people 
not really understanding that 

3110
02:27:02,160 --> 02:27:05,641
palestinians are not all terrorists and 
that it's really just a case of being 

3111
02:27:05,641 --> 02:27:07,480
occupied and like getting freedom.

3112
02:27:07,480 --> 02:27:10,180
So it's,
it's really tough man.

3113
02:27:10,181 --> 02:27:12,940
But a lot of these israelis want,
they just want to push the palestinians.

3114
02:27:13,830 --> 02:27:15,220
They wanted,
they want them to go,

3115
02:27:15,550 --> 02:27:18,010
they want them.
They don't care as long as they're gone,

3116
02:27:20,410 --> 02:27:22,390
as long as they're gone.
I mean,

3117
02:27:22,960 --> 02:27:27,040
here's an example of how crazy it is.
El rosario as a soldier there,

3118
02:27:27,041 --> 02:27:27,970
you know,
and in the us,

3119
02:27:28,030 --> 02:27:32,710
when police kill black people and we 
have rallies like black lives matter,

3120
02:27:32,711 --> 02:27:36,700
people have rallies in support of these 
people who get killed in Israel.

3121
02:27:36,701 --> 02:27:38,740
They have mass rallies,
10,000,

3122
02:27:38,741 --> 02:27:40,480
20,000
people strong in tel aviv.

3123
02:27:41,080 --> 02:27:46,080
If a soldier executes and unarmed 
palestinian man and gets a slap on the 

3124
02:27:46,080 --> 02:27:50,401
wrist.
Like this guy leo rosaria executed an 

3125
02:27:50,401 --> 02:27:50,401
unarmed palestinian.
It was on video.

3126
02:27:50,410 --> 02:27:54,490
It's a horrific video and because there 
was this international uproar about it,

3127
02:27:54,820 --> 02:27:56,500
Israel had to put him on house arrest.

3128
02:27:56,560 --> 02:27:59,920
The israeli government put him on house 
arrest and that was enough for like mass

3129
02:27:59,921 --> 02:28:04,921
mobilization of tens of thousands of 
people to come out and protest the fact 

3130
02:28:04,921 --> 02:28:06,190
that he was getting even reprimanded as 
slap on the wrist.

3131
02:28:06,191 --> 02:28:07,410
They get house arrest,
video available.

3132
02:28:07,450 --> 02:28:09,460
Absolutely,
and they're chanting death to arabs.

3133
02:28:09,461 --> 02:28:13,780
There's tens of thousands of google and 
look up dan cohen and david schien.

3134
02:28:14,050 --> 02:28:16,520
They do aMazing journalism there.
They were living that.

3135
02:28:16,530 --> 02:28:18,310
David jean is israeli.
He's.

3136
02:28:18,330 --> 02:28:21,100
He's been there and he documents these 
crazy rallies,

3137
02:28:21,290 --> 02:28:26,290
fascist fucking rallies that no one else
has shown and until I saw that until I 

3138
02:28:26,811 --> 02:28:30,110
saw People chanting death to the 
videographers because they hate when you

3139
02:28:30,111 --> 02:28:33,860
even film like what's going on there?
Death to the leftists.

3140
02:28:34,150 --> 02:28:39,150
A really scary man.
It's just a completely different 

3141
02:28:39,150 --> 02:28:39,150
society.
Here it is.

3142
02:28:39,150 --> 02:28:40,450
Here it is.
Nuts.

3143
02:28:40,950 --> 02:28:45,950
It's a long videos.
It was just the two of them.

3144
02:28:46,060 --> 02:28:47,140
That bro skis.
Yeah,

3145
02:28:48,320 --> 02:28:51,470
go forward until you see this.
Just like crazy.

3146
02:28:52,890 --> 02:28:56,090
We're being criticized all over the 
world is if they are righteous,

3147
02:28:57,060 --> 02:29:00,600
killed for less than the United States 
is the worst.

3148
02:29:00,601 --> 02:29:02,130
They bomb pop,
so she's basically saying,

3149
02:29:02,131 --> 02:29:05,340
how dare you criticize us when you guys 
do this shit,

3150
02:29:05,341 --> 02:29:08,330
which is a good point.
Just the war policemen,

3151
02:29:08,350 --> 02:29:12,000
usu blacks,
and it's okay because the whole circus,

3152
02:29:12,001 --> 02:29:14,880
the world per se,
that israeli army are really murderers.

3153
02:29:16,290 --> 02:29:21,290
We gave them an official license to call
us murderers instead of covering it up 

3154
02:29:22,141 --> 02:29:25,050
and dealing with it ourselves.
Why make so much noise?

3155
02:29:25,110 --> 02:29:27,240
Whoa.
Instead she's pro covering it up.

3156
02:29:27,690 --> 02:29:32,690
Once a soldier understands that he can 
be charged with manslaughter next time 

3157
02:29:33,601 --> 02:29:38,601
he'll think twice,
and that hesitation is likely to cost 

3158
02:29:38,601 --> 02:29:39,060
soldiers part of this.
Wow,

3159
02:29:39,270 --> 02:29:41,340
this is interesting.
Our brother lr,

3160
02:29:43,020 --> 02:29:48,020
so everyone's cheering on the soldier 
were certainly now sitting in an open 

3161
02:29:48,020 --> 02:29:52,071
jail,
an army base in the center of the 

3162
02:29:52,071 --> 02:29:52,071
country watching tv.

3163
02:29:52,650 --> 02:29:55,270
The kid will pay,
but then at vizio,

3164
02:29:56,550 --> 02:29:58,240
he's in at all

3165
02:29:58,680 --> 02:30:00,390
look alone,
a law.

3166
02:30:00,410 --> 02:30:05,410
The jewish people support you.
The jewish people are with you and he's 

3167
02:30:07,911 --> 02:30:12,911
about to say,
jewish people did not abandon their 

3168
02:30:12,911 --> 02:30:13,790
soldiers started to chant death.
They're present or the future.

3169
02:30:17,830 --> 02:30:18,380
Whoa.

3170
02:30:19,680 --> 02:30:20,610
you are not alone.

3171
02:30:26,070 --> 02:30:31,070
They're mad because they're all tight.
Summary execution is like an 

3172
02:30:31,070 --> 02:30:33,150
institutionalized thing,
so they're all like,

3173
02:30:33,151 --> 02:30:38,151
why the hell is this guy getting 
persecuted for something that everyone 

3174
02:30:38,151 --> 02:30:38,151
just acknowledges that this is

3175
02:30:38,220 --> 02:30:40,350
so the soldiers have to be in their 
eyes,

3176
02:30:40,500 --> 02:30:43,860
so just have to be able to just execute 
anytime they want.

3177
02:30:43,990 --> 02:30:46,080
Go to that,
go to that huge rally at the end.

3178
02:30:47,050 --> 02:30:52,050
Do you think that they feel like trapped
and surrounded and that they make this 

3179
02:30:53,281 --> 02:30:56,280
justification because they feel like 
there's arab states all around?

3180
02:30:56,520 --> 02:30:57,900
Oh my god,
they have a fucking concert,

3181
02:30:58,130 --> 02:30:58,670
so yeah.
No,

3182
02:30:58,730 --> 02:31:01,240
that was wearing adidas.
Don't.

3183
02:31:01,241 --> 02:31:04,710
The help of god was really shoulders 
would return home peaceably.

3184
02:31:06,400 --> 02:31:08,910
No hope of god.
All Terrorists will be neutralized.

3185
02:31:09,460 --> 02:31:10,410
Go to that part.
Yeah.

3186
02:31:10,420 --> 02:31:15,110
Go to their flowers in the gunbarrel 
israeli national.

3187
02:31:15,290 --> 02:31:16,140
Yeah.
Where it shows the

3188
02:31:18,230 --> 02:31:21,660
thank you for coming good and told her 
respect part in this video.

3189
02:31:21,661 --> 02:31:23,340
people should watch it where it says,
yeah,

3190
02:31:23,341 --> 02:31:25,590
we'll flip the country over free.
The boy debt.

3191
02:31:25,591 --> 02:31:26,400
The arabs Were,
does it?

3192
02:31:26,520 --> 02:31:29,520
That's the hard part.
Come in.

3193
02:31:31,880 --> 02:31:33,400
so how did these guys get away with 
film?

3194
02:31:33,401 --> 02:31:35,840
And this is the king of Israel.

3195
02:31:38,530 --> 02:31:39,500
The dog.

3196
02:31:42,070 --> 02:31:43,390
yeah,
it's really great.

3197
02:31:44,620 --> 02:31:45,580
It's very intense.
I mean,

3198
02:31:45,581 --> 02:31:48,280
yeah,
of course israelis are indoctrinated.

3199
02:31:48,460 --> 02:31:49,780
I dunno,
it's a 10 minute video,

3200
02:31:49,781 --> 02:31:52,030
but it's part of the,
when the giant rallies,

3201
02:31:52,031 --> 02:31:55,040
we have it in our videos too on the um,
on empire files.

3202
02:31:55,460 --> 02:31:56,980
Yeah,
it's really wild.

3203
02:31:57,010 --> 02:31:59,630
We didn't want to vote ultra right 
square,

3204
02:31:59,700 --> 02:32:04,700
full the squares for.
Because he's saying that the 

3205
02:32:04,700 --> 02:32:04,900
establishment makes it seem like an arab
as a son of a whore,

3206
02:32:04,960 --> 02:32:05,980
a jew as a soul.

3207
02:32:07,970 --> 02:32:08,960
Wow.

3208
02:32:11,250 --> 02:32:14,800
His friends asked you here,
embarrassed.

3209
02:32:15,090 --> 02:32:20,090
They don't want this on film.
We only came to embrace and love the 

3210
02:32:20,090 --> 02:32:23,280
army and the soldiers.
He's trying to change the football club.

3211
02:32:23,330 --> 02:32:24,220
Yes.
Anybody?

3212
02:32:24,800 --> 02:32:25,500
No,
no.

3213
02:32:26,040 --> 02:32:28,980
This isn't about killing.
ARabs were about celebrating the army.

3214
02:32:29,100 --> 02:32:34,100
Anyway,
there's some really crazy stuff like my 

3215
02:32:34,100 --> 02:32:34,100
friend david,
was it listening to terrible music.

3216
02:32:34,100 --> 02:32:38,090
Oh god.
Fucking sick of waiting for peace.

3217
02:32:43,520 --> 02:32:48,520
I will know her on their dream about it 
until I die together with this holy 

3218
02:32:52,051 --> 02:32:54,030
crowd.
I utter a prayer.

3219
02:32:54,330 --> 02:32:56,400
Jesus christ,
like we would go in there

3220
02:32:56,500 --> 02:32:58,210
huge jerusalem and tel aviv and people 
be like,

3221
02:32:58,211 --> 02:32:59,860
are you arab?
And I'm like,

3222
02:32:59,861 --> 02:33:04,861
what?
Like they just immeDiately just have 

3223
02:33:04,861 --> 02:33:07,720
this distrust and hatred for arabs.
It's extremely intense and like you were

3224
02:33:07,721 --> 02:33:12,721
saying,
I mean this is the thing that starts 

3225
02:33:12,721 --> 02:33:14,191
from childhood.
You are indoctrinated to think that 

3226
02:33:14,191 --> 02:33:14,890
every single person is trying to kill 
you.

3227
02:33:15,160 --> 02:33:17,880
So all these people or these kinds of 
film this,

3228
02:33:17,980 --> 02:33:21,820
they're kind of fucked now they,
they've been jumped.

3229
02:33:21,821 --> 02:33:24,100
My friend david shane was junk because 
someone came up to when he was like,

3230
02:33:24,101 --> 02:33:29,101
where's your fucking flag?
Because you like were israeli flags as 

3231
02:33:29,101 --> 02:33:29,101
capes.
A lot of these people like wear them.

3232
02:33:29,101 --> 02:33:31,210
It's extremely fascist and he was just 
like my flag.

3233
02:33:31,211 --> 02:33:31,690
And they're like,
yeah,

3234
02:33:31,691 --> 02:33:33,400
where's your fucking flag?
And they'd beat him up,

3235
02:33:34,060 --> 02:33:36,490
took his camera.
And this happens all the time.

3236
02:33:36,491 --> 02:33:41,491
I mean they,
they luckily he's an israeli jew so he 

3237
02:33:41,491 --> 02:33:41,491
doesn't get that much heat.

3238
02:33:41,491 --> 02:33:41,990
But my friend dan is also,
you know,

3239
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:43,600
it looks like a,
he is a jew,

3240
02:33:44,140 --> 02:33:46,060
so they don't really give him heat,
but like yeah,

3241
02:33:46,120 --> 02:33:49,300
it's really dangerous to film there and 
it's really dangerous to document what's

3242
02:33:49,301 --> 02:33:54,301
going on.
They must be particularly furious about 

3243
02:33:54,301 --> 02:33:54,700
israeli jews that expose this stuff.
Oh yeah.

3244
02:33:54,780 --> 02:33:56,590
There are definitely targeted.
Yeah.

3245
02:33:56,770 --> 02:33:59,230
It's dangerous for them to be in the 
country for sure.

3246
02:34:00,450 --> 02:34:04,000
That,
that really ruthless patriotism.

3247
02:34:04,190 --> 02:34:09,190
Right?
The woman was saying that the soldiers 

3248
02:34:09,190 --> 02:34:09,880
might hesitate if they can be charged 
with manslaughter,

3249
02:34:10,690 --> 02:34:12,580
you know,
to move.

3250
02:34:13,600 --> 02:34:14,740
Yeah.
It's pretty intense.

3251
02:34:14,741 --> 02:34:17,230
So I feel like,
yeah,

3252
02:34:17,470 --> 02:34:18,240
the whole Israel

3253
02:34:18,240 --> 02:34:22,320
thing and people are confused about like
bannon and this antisemitism thing.

3254
02:34:22,321 --> 02:34:22,830
Look,
you can,

3255
02:34:22,860 --> 02:34:27,860
you can hate jews and love Israel.
Just like Richard Spencer is a perfect 

3256
02:34:27,860 --> 02:34:31,221
example.
Richard spencer sees Israel as the 

3257
02:34:31,221 --> 02:34:33,531
perfect example of what he wants the us 
to be because it's an ethnos supremacist

3258
02:34:34,620 --> 02:34:37,350
nationalist state and that's what these 
people love.

3259
02:34:37,351 --> 02:34:42,351
So you can be anti semitic and still 
love the notion of fostering like a 

3260
02:34:42,351 --> 02:34:45,480
certain group,
a certain identity.

3261
02:34:46,470 --> 02:34:51,470
so does,
does he think we should have mel 

3262
02:34:51,470 --> 02:34:51,470
mandatory military service or they do 
it?

3263
02:34:51,470 --> 02:34:51,470
Well,
he,

3264
02:34:51,470 --> 02:34:55,951
he definitely doesn't want different 
races breeding so I think that he 

3265
02:34:55,951 --> 02:34:57,050
probably just wants like an insular 
society.

3266
02:34:57,051 --> 02:34:57,100
Yeah,

3267
02:34:57,130 --> 02:35:01,840
I'll just like white people.
She is christ nazi-ism when when you get

3268
02:35:02,230 --> 02:35:05,020
a bunch of people and everybody has to 
join the army.

3269
02:35:05,140 --> 02:35:05,750
He,
he,

3270
02:35:05,760 --> 02:35:08,470
there's a disturbing.
There's a bond that they have.

3271
02:35:08,471 --> 02:35:13,471
It's very different than the regular 
civilian bond and the like the 

3272
02:35:14,291 --> 02:35:18,190
indoctrination that you get once you've 
been in the military and you fought side

3273
02:35:18,191 --> 02:35:20,320
by side with your brothers and sisters 
in arms.

3274
02:35:20,600 --> 02:35:23,350
So until a totally different feeling,
you know,

3275
02:35:23,351 --> 02:35:25,120
I know,
I know a lot of people that have been in

3276
02:35:25,150 --> 02:35:30,150
the military and some of them got deeper
in it than others and like those people,

3277
02:35:30,521 --> 02:35:35,521
like it's almost like an us versus them.
Their society that know that whole chris

3278
02:35:35,831 --> 02:35:37,280
kyle sheep dog thing.
right.

3279
02:35:37,590 --> 02:35:40,450
You know,
like there's there protecting us,

3280
02:35:41,020 --> 02:35:46,020
but they together as a group are much 
tighter than any other group in the 

3281
02:35:47,171 --> 02:35:48,850
United States.
I mean there's,

3282
02:35:48,910 --> 02:35:51,640
there's division in all groups.
Right.

3283
02:35:51,970 --> 02:35:56,590
But I got to imagine that the bond that 
they have as israelis,

3284
02:35:56,920 --> 02:35:59,020
all of them have been,
been in the military,

3285
02:35:59,021 --> 02:36:03,880
all of them living in this one small 
area surrounded by arab states.

3286
02:36:04,560 --> 02:36:07,960
It's got to be super intense.
They should've created Israel,

3287
02:36:07,961 --> 02:36:11,560
not in the god damn middle of the middle
east.

3288
02:36:11,710 --> 02:36:16,710
Put it in fucking Australia.
Like what the hell were they thinking 

3289
02:36:16,710 --> 02:36:20,860
isn't about the history of that region.
But was it mean sikes,

3290
02:36:20,861 --> 02:36:21,520
pico,

3291
02:36:21,850 --> 02:36:26,850
western empires.
You basically just drew a line through 

3292
02:36:26,850 --> 02:36:30,301
the middle east and divided all these 
countries and formed all these borders 

3293
02:36:30,301 --> 02:36:32,410
back like 120 years ago.
I don't know,

3294
02:36:32,411 --> 02:36:34,110
like 19.
When was sex pico?

3295
02:36:34,120 --> 02:36:36,580
I don't know.
Somewhere around that time.

3296
02:36:36,581 --> 02:36:41,581
So anyway,
fast forward to when the ottoman empire 

3297
02:36:41,581 --> 02:36:44,551
was colonizing this area and the british
were occupying what is palestine,

3298
02:36:45,190 --> 02:36:47,920
right?
And the zionist lobby was really strong.

3299
02:36:47,921 --> 02:36:50,350
This is well before the holocaust.
And they were super,

3300
02:36:50,351 --> 02:36:52,960
super strong and embolden and they were 
negotiating with the,

3301
02:36:53,580 --> 02:36:56,020
um,
with the brits about where they can form

3302
02:36:56,021 --> 02:37:01,021
like a jewish state.
And there really was no support until 

3303
02:37:01,021 --> 02:37:01,270
the holocaust where they were able to 
sell,

3304
02:37:01,271 --> 02:37:01,610
like,
you know,

3305
02:37:01,650 --> 02:37:06,650
the fear more and there was even false 
flag attacks were zionist organizations 

3306
02:37:06,650 --> 02:37:10,951
were going around different arab 
countries and committing terrorism and 

3307
02:37:10,951 --> 02:37:10,951
insane,
like,

3308
02:37:10,951 --> 02:37:14,900
all right,
like the jews need to come and escape 

3309
02:37:14,900 --> 02:37:14,900
that you guys are being persecuted.

3310
02:37:14,900 --> 02:37:14,900
Like they would actually carry out 
terrorism,

3311
02:37:14,900 --> 02:37:17,090
it like and stuff.
And thiS is all documented.

3312
02:37:17,091 --> 02:37:19,460
Yeah.
But the ethnic cleansing that went on,

3313
02:37:19,461 --> 02:37:20,990
I mean,
it's horrific.

3314
02:37:20,991 --> 02:37:25,991
There's dozens of massacres that 
happened in the formation of Israel 

3315
02:37:25,991 --> 02:37:29,300
because even though it was partitioned 
initially by the un,

3316
02:37:29,301 --> 02:37:32,450
I don't know who,
who gave like this international body,

3317
02:37:32,451 --> 02:37:35,120
the authority to partition a country on 
top of another country.

3318
02:37:35,360 --> 02:37:36,920
But on top of that,
um,

3319
02:37:37,190 --> 02:37:42,190
there was several massacres that just 
continued to take more and more of the 

3320
02:37:42,190 --> 02:37:42,190
land as I said.
And since,

3321
02:37:42,190 --> 02:37:46,930
and that was called the noc button.
So all these people were expelled 

3322
02:37:46,930 --> 02:37:49,541
violently and purged From their lands.
And we visited some of these refugee 

3323
02:37:49,541 --> 02:37:50,600
camps and the people were just like,
we literally,

3324
02:37:50,601 --> 02:37:55,601
our houses are like five miles away and 
we're just stuck in these camps and 

3325
02:37:55,601 --> 02:37:55,940
we've been here for 50 years.

3326
02:37:57,320 --> 02:37:58,130
Yeah,
it's sick.

3327
02:37:58,131 --> 02:38:01,040
And they have.
And they have like no water.

3328
02:38:01,310 --> 02:38:06,310
They just have one water tank every 
month and israeli soldiers will go and 

3329
02:38:06,310 --> 02:38:08,120
spray skunk spray,
which is like a military manufactured,

3330
02:38:08,390 --> 02:38:11,420
disgusting,
toxic tasting spray that sounds,

3331
02:38:11,450 --> 02:38:16,450
that's like tastes like sewage water.
And they'll just go target these water 

3332
02:38:16,450 --> 02:38:17,990
tanks and then your water will be fucked
for the whole month.

3333
02:38:18,620 --> 02:38:23,620
There's just little things like this 
just to make people's lives a living 

3334
02:38:23,620 --> 02:38:23,620
hell.
Now.

3335
02:38:23,620 --> 02:38:25,270
Did you film when you were over there?
Yeah,

3336
02:38:25,280 --> 02:38:27,340
we have tons of.
We have tons of data.

3337
02:38:27,380 --> 02:38:30,230
We have what?
We have four episodes out where we,

3338
02:38:30,280 --> 02:38:35,280
you know,
I go to anti-refugee rallies and I'm 

3339
02:38:35,280 --> 02:38:37,451
talking to people who are telling me 
that these people are subhuman 

3340
02:38:37,451 --> 02:38:40,571
infiltrators.
You need to be executed and rounded up 

3341
02:38:40,571 --> 02:38:40,640
and put in chains.
It's all on film.

3342
02:38:41,120 --> 02:38:41,920
I mean it's,
it's,

3343
02:38:41,921 --> 02:38:44,150
it's really crazy and I.

3344
02:38:44,240 --> 02:38:49,240
You really don't understand how bad it 
is and why it's so dangerous and how 

3345
02:38:49,240 --> 02:38:51,050
really it's been the crux of so many 
problems in the world,

3346
02:38:51,710 --> 02:38:54,520
especially in that region,
like what we've done just to create this

3347
02:38:54,521 --> 02:38:59,521
settler colonial state in the middle of 
the middle east and expel all these 

3348
02:38:59,521 --> 02:39:00,800
people violently and then just 
unconditionally support Israel.

3349
02:39:00,801 --> 02:39:03,230
No matter what war crimes they commit,
no matter who they bombed,

3350
02:39:03,231 --> 02:39:08,231
no matter who they kill it sick and 
people don't respect us for doing that 

3351
02:39:08,231 --> 02:39:12,880
and it's super hypocritical.
When we're engaging in military 

3352
02:39:12,880 --> 02:39:14,330
operations in the name of fucking 
morality and humanitarianism.

3353
02:39:14,660 --> 02:39:17,000
Why do you think do openly support 
Israel to where they do?

3354
02:39:17,420 --> 02:39:22,420
It's really weird to say like,
why do we support Saudi Arabia to Saudi 

3355
02:39:22,420 --> 02:39:26,660
Arabia has oil.
There's some logic to connect dots.

3356
02:39:26,661 --> 02:39:31,661
They're really simple.
I don't believe the whole zionist lobby 

3357
02:39:31,661 --> 02:39:31,661
controls the us.

3358
02:39:31,661 --> 02:39:35,740
I think that it's a partnership.
I think that the us sees a lot of 

3359
02:39:35,740 --> 02:39:39,010
leverage having Israel there,
but I think it's becoming more unpopular

3360
02:39:39,050 --> 02:39:44,050
where it's almost becoming a liability 
because the rest of the world is 

3361
02:39:44,050 --> 02:39:47,830
increasingly realizing how fucked up the
situation is and trying to boycott like 

3362
02:39:47,830 --> 02:39:48,890
the state,
you know,

3363
02:39:48,891 --> 02:39:50,150
and,
and the us is,

3364
02:39:50,151 --> 02:39:53,810
it's not going to be a popular thing.
Like even when obama was leaving office,

3365
02:39:53,811 --> 02:39:58,811
he did that kind of cursory like 
superficial thing where they for the 

3366
02:39:58,811 --> 02:40:02,501
first time didn't veto Israel or didn't 
veto like the condemnation of israeli 

3367
02:40:02,501 --> 02:40:03,370
settlements.
And so that was like,

3368
02:40:03,770 --> 02:40:08,770
we didn't not do it but we just like 
didn't veto it for the first time in a 

3369
02:40:08,770 --> 02:40:11,921
long time.
And that was a huge slap in the face to 

3370
02:40:11,921 --> 02:40:12,560
Israel even though it was like nothing 
but just as symbolic empty gesture.

3371
02:40:12,740 --> 02:40:13,980
But that kind of obama's like

3372
02:40:13,980 --> 02:40:17,070
fuck you as I was leaving,
but it really didn't do anything.

3373
02:40:17,071 --> 02:40:22,071
But it's just,
it shows you that there's a lot of 

3374
02:40:22,071 --> 02:40:22,071
divisions,
I think from the inside.

3375
02:40:22,071 --> 02:40:25,230
And I think the government is realizing 
like it might not be worth it.

3376
02:40:25,800 --> 02:40:27,920
Um,
if the pressure continues to,

3377
02:40:27,970 --> 02:40:32,970
to mountain,
I mean we need to put pressure on our 

3378
02:40:32,970 --> 02:40:35,061
government to stop this occupation 
because it's completely inhumane and 

3379
02:40:35,061 --> 02:40:39,590
disgraceful.
So you said you have four episodes of 

3380
02:40:39,590 --> 02:40:40,590
this that are outright four episodes and
we're putting more out.

3381
02:40:40,710 --> 02:40:45,710
We're putting the episode with all the 
interviews with israelis next on empire 

3382
02:40:45,961 --> 02:40:47,250
files on our,
on our show,

3383
02:40:47,251 --> 02:40:49,470
on youtube.
Is it just,

3384
02:40:49,471 --> 02:40:50,980
that's the name of the channel?
Yeah.

3385
02:40:50,981 --> 02:40:53,040
So empire files is the name of the 
channel.

3386
02:40:53,041 --> 02:40:55,320
And then if you go to the empire 
files.tv,

3387
02:40:55,321 --> 02:40:57,780
we have all of our archive on there that
you can check out.

3388
02:40:57,810 --> 02:41:02,810
So is this all your stuff now?
You're doing this all completely 

3389
02:41:02,810 --> 02:41:02,810
independently?
Yup.

3390
02:41:02,810 --> 02:41:04,140
That's intense.
It's really intense.

3391
02:41:04,200 --> 02:41:06,870
Yeah.
What is it like being your own boss?

3392
02:41:06,871 --> 02:41:11,871
Now?
Hard because I really love smoking weed 

3393
02:41:11,871 --> 02:41:15,150
and not procrastinating so it's really 
hard to like get shit done and then I'll

3394
02:41:15,151 --> 02:41:16,260
be like,
oh man,

3395
02:41:16,261 --> 02:41:19,110
I need to put all this together.
So it's like just totally.

3396
02:41:19,170 --> 02:41:23,270
Me and my partner just kind of have a 
deep sense of responsibility really into

3397
02:41:23,300 --> 02:41:25,350
somewhere like this and drop this kind 
of footage.

3398
02:41:25,470 --> 02:41:26,490
Yes,
definitely.

3399
02:41:26,520 --> 02:41:31,520
And we also went to the amazon and and 
saw the mess that chevron left there,

3400
02:41:31,711 --> 02:41:36,711
like an 18 billion gallons of oil just 
festering in the amazon jungle that's 

3401
02:41:36,711 --> 02:41:38,120
just been left real.
YeAh.

3402
02:41:38,130 --> 02:41:40,560
And they just lied about a bunch of pits
and never cleaned it up.

3403
02:41:40,561 --> 02:41:43,140
And so we went and I was like standing 
in the soil pit and I was like,

3404
02:41:43,141 --> 02:41:44,160
what the fuck is this?

3405
02:41:44,160 --> 02:41:49,160
Everyone's dying of cancer.
I mean it's a whole nother level when 

3406
02:41:49,160 --> 02:41:49,160
you're,
you know,

3407
02:41:49,160 --> 02:41:50,760
you're not just reacting to the news and
giving commentary.

3408
02:41:50,761 --> 02:41:55,761
Like we were saying before in a studio,
you're going there and it's like the 

3409
02:41:55,861 --> 02:42:00,861
truth is in front of your face,
just the first time you've done stuff 

3410
02:42:00,861 --> 02:42:00,861
like this.
Yeah.

3411
02:42:00,861 --> 02:42:04,790
So you just felt like when you were on 
our t that you were kind of shackled by 

3412
02:42:04,790 --> 02:42:08,361
being in the studio and to really get a 
feel of these subjects that we're 

3413
02:42:08,361 --> 02:42:09,400
covering.
Because I'm really emotional.

3414
02:42:09,401 --> 02:42:11,310
I wear my heart on my sleeve and it,
you know,

3415
02:42:11,330 --> 02:42:12,600
it's a detriment.
Very fiery.

3416
02:42:13,740 --> 02:42:15,070
Sometimes it's a detriment,
but I,

3417
02:42:15,170 --> 02:42:15,670
I,
you know,

3418
02:42:15,671 --> 02:42:20,671
I wanted to go and really be there.
I feel like I need to be connected to 

3419
02:42:20,671 --> 02:42:24,171
the,
to the people I'm talking about and 

3420
02:42:24,171 --> 02:42:24,171
kudos to you for doing that.

3421
02:42:24,171 --> 02:42:24,990
Thanks.
I'm going to wash this stuff.

3422
02:42:24,991 --> 02:42:26,130
I'm going to watch.
Check it out man.

3423
02:42:26,440 --> 02:42:27,480
I will.
And so,

3424
02:42:27,481 --> 02:42:30,990
empire fire arrows on youtube.
What do you have coming up?

3425
02:42:31,380 --> 02:42:34,500
So coming up we have um,
we're going to Venezuela.

3426
02:42:35,940 --> 02:42:37,550
Venezuela just fell apart,
right?

3427
02:42:37,560 --> 02:42:40,040
It's a dictatorship right now.
Did you hear they,

3428
02:42:40,050 --> 02:42:43,440
they took over the gm plant.
Well that wasn't the government actually

3429
02:42:43,441 --> 02:42:45,510
that came out that it was not the 
government that did that,

3430
02:42:45,511 --> 02:42:48,330
But yet I don't know if they issued a 
correction.

3431
02:42:48,331 --> 02:42:50,260
That was not a real story.
But yeah.

3432
02:42:50,270 --> 02:42:53,550
No,
it's not such a mess.

3433
02:42:54,030 --> 02:42:56,340
There are massive.
I mean,

3434
02:42:56,341 --> 02:42:58,740
can you imagine if like,
oh my god,

3435
02:42:58,741 --> 02:43:03,741
I don't even know,
like millions of people from both sides 

3436
02:43:03,741 --> 02:43:03,741
are out.
Just fighting in the streets.

3437
02:43:03,741 --> 02:43:08,390
Like it is the craziest going there to 
report subtle shot.

3438
02:43:09,900 --> 02:43:11,410
I know it's scary.
It's scarier.

3439
02:43:11,500 --> 02:43:13,300
Like 30 people have died already,
but.

3440
02:43:13,420 --> 02:43:14,450
oh fuck.
You know.

3441
02:43:14,860 --> 02:43:19,860
But I feel like we need to go and shed 
some light about what the hell is going 

3442
02:43:19,860 --> 02:43:19,860
on.

3443
02:43:19,860 --> 02:43:22,850
Gem fires.
Two thousand 700 employees by text 

3444
02:43:22,850 --> 02:43:26,151
message after Venezuela plant seizure.
We all received a payment and a text 

3445
02:43:26,151 --> 02:43:28,290
message there no longer anyone in the 
country.

3446
02:43:29,220 --> 02:43:31,980
What does it go down?
Wow.

3447
02:43:32,430 --> 02:43:36,300
So they just took over the company.
They just took over the spill that.

3448
02:43:37,050 --> 02:43:41,190
Wait a minute.
Who's saying so what is it?

3449
02:43:41,191 --> 02:43:46,191
What are they saying here?
Local government is part of the south 

3450
02:43:46,191 --> 02:43:46,191
american countries.
Ongoing economic,

3451
02:43:46,191 --> 02:43:50,241
political and social crisis is being 
seized by the local government 

3452
02:43:50,241 --> 02:43:50,340
illegally.

3453
02:43:52,240 --> 02:43:54,250
I swear to god that I saw this story 
retracted,

3454
02:43:54,251 --> 02:43:56,350
but who knows?
Maybe this is the dr.

3455
02:43:56,590 --> 02:43:58,140
Com.
This is just a car site.

3456
02:43:58,830 --> 02:44:02,670
It's like sponsored counter reported 
that thing.

3457
02:44:02,680 --> 02:44:05,790
It was looked like they were big.
Abandoning it for awhile though.

3458
02:44:05,800 --> 02:44:08,170
They've abandoned it for awhile.
Gm was going to abandon it over like.

3459
02:44:09,940 --> 02:44:10,540
No,
I'm just kidding.

3460
02:44:10,541 --> 02:44:11,980
I mean,
it's a total mess.

3461
02:44:12,120 --> 02:44:15,120
According to rotor routers report on 
monday,

3462
02:44:15,121 --> 02:44:20,121
it looks like general motors is 
abandoning Venezuela for awhile to 

3463
02:44:20,121 --> 02:44:22,950
employees,
told routers that giant employee plant's

3464
02:44:22,951 --> 02:44:24,960
employees were all fired via text 
message,

3465
02:44:24,961 --> 02:44:25,260
blah,
blah,

3466
02:44:25,261 --> 02:44:30,261
blah.
Corporate email accounts were all 

3467
02:44:30,261 --> 02:44:30,990
deactivated over the weekend.
We received a payment in text message.

3468
02:44:31,410 --> 02:44:33,870
The size of the payments was not 
disclosed,

3469
02:44:33,871 --> 02:44:35,970
were not disclosed,
but according to the union leaders,

3470
02:44:35,971 --> 02:44:39,300
they were too low.
Of course unions never said they paid us

3471
02:44:39,301 --> 02:44:40,890
perfect.
Everything's great.

3472
02:44:41,240 --> 02:44:43,470
We're psyched.
Yeah,

3473
02:44:43,471 --> 02:44:44,190
man,
it's gonna be,

3474
02:44:44,250 --> 02:44:45,780
it's gonna be crazy.
Bach.

3475
02:44:45,900 --> 02:44:50,900
So Venezuela essentially is now some 
sort of a dictatorship,

3476
02:44:51,920 --> 02:44:53,090
right?
I don't think so.

3477
02:44:53,091 --> 02:44:55,760
I think that that happened.
Well,

3478
02:44:55,761 --> 02:44:56,690
I don't know.
Um,

3479
02:44:56,691 --> 02:44:57,820
I don't know.
Uh,

3480
02:44:57,830 --> 02:44:59,150
no,
not until you get there.

3481
02:44:59,360 --> 02:45:00,080
Well,
I've been,

3482
02:45:00,560 --> 02:45:03,500
I think that there's just a lot of 
misinformation out there just like there

3483
02:45:03,501 --> 02:45:05,140
is about every country that,
you know,

3484
02:45:05,180 --> 02:45:10,180
rex tillerson just announced that we 
want to install another regime in 

3485
02:45:10,551 --> 02:45:12,500
Venezuela.
Chavez was a,

3486
02:45:12,501 --> 02:45:14,990
was a target from the us empire for a 
long time.

3487
02:45:14,991 --> 02:45:19,220
So I just really take everything that I 
read with a grain of salt,

3488
02:45:19,340 --> 02:45:21,440
especially in light of all the serious 
stuff.

3489
02:45:21,441 --> 02:45:23,870
I just feel like we're in a really heavy
propaganda war.

3490
02:45:23,960 --> 02:45:24,830
Um,
you know,

3491
02:45:24,831 --> 02:45:29,831
you look back in the queue when we 
actually removed hugo chavez from power 

3492
02:45:29,831 --> 02:45:31,040
for a couple of days,
the New York times was praising it,

3493
02:45:31,041 --> 02:45:35,110
being a distinguished business 
businessman took over,

3494
02:45:35,450 --> 02:45:36,370
like,
you know,

3495
02:45:36,380 --> 02:45:39,530
not mentioning like the us was behind 
all of this.

3496
02:45:39,531 --> 02:45:42,320
So I just all the media talking about,
you know,

3497
02:45:42,330 --> 02:45:45,500
it's a dictatorship and,
and this is a pro democracy movement.

3498
02:45:45,501 --> 02:45:50,501
I don't doUbt that there are millions of
people who want maduro gone and they 

3499
02:45:50,501 --> 02:45:54,071
have val absolutely valid things to say 
and there's a lot of fucked up things 

3500
02:45:54,071 --> 02:45:54,071
about the country,
mismanagement,

3501
02:45:54,071 --> 02:45:54,410
corruption,
et cetera.

3502
02:45:54,950 --> 02:45:57,770
But I'm going to go there and try to 
find out what's going on.

3503
02:45:57,771 --> 02:45:58,200
If you want

3504
02:45:58,310 --> 02:46:03,310
get a chevy volt for $29,000,
the only way you do is you got to get 

3505
02:46:03,310 --> 02:46:04,340
those vent as well and people to work 
for a dollar a week.

3506
02:46:04,520 --> 02:46:06,980
So unless you've got a better idea,
how about you?

3507
02:46:06,981 --> 02:46:07,580
Fuck off.

3508
02:46:08,800 --> 02:46:10,850
Wait how greatest trump's economic plan,
he's like,

3509
02:46:11,210 --> 02:46:14,420
just give corporations giant tax breaks 
and all the jobs will come back here.

3510
02:46:14,421 --> 02:46:14,960
You're like,
waiT.

3511
02:46:14,961 --> 02:46:19,961
Corporations already have giant tax 
breaks and they're never going to 

3512
02:46:19,961 --> 02:46:22,601
fucking come back here unless they can 
pay people ten cents on the dollar like 

3513
02:46:22,601 --> 02:46:24,250
they do in Bangladesh.
How is that a plan

3514
02:46:24,340 --> 02:46:25,510
or China?
I mean,

3515
02:46:25,511 --> 02:46:27,030
what were our phones?
You know,

3516
02:46:27,040 --> 02:46:30,010
I mean the foxconn companies don't have 
nets around the,

3517
02:46:30,420 --> 02:46:35,420
the buildings because the job's awesome.
They have nets to keep people from 

3518
02:46:35,420 --> 02:46:37,660
killing themselves.
That's extremely disturbing.

3519
02:46:37,720 --> 02:46:40,420
I mean that's the only way you get 
people to make a cell phone.

3520
02:46:40,421 --> 02:46:40,990
This,
that cheap.

3521
02:46:41,060 --> 02:46:46,060
We've reviewed it like we went over the 
numbers of like what a cell phone would 

3522
02:46:46,060 --> 02:46:49,420
cost if you had it made in America and 
you gave people a living wage.

3523
02:46:49,830 --> 02:46:51,620
It's like more than double.
Yeah.

3524
02:46:51,760 --> 02:46:55,840
I feel like you.
I would pay that if I knew that I waSn't

3525
02:46:55,841 --> 02:47:00,841
using conflict minerals,
but conflict minerals and the least of 

3526
02:47:00,841 --> 02:47:04,491
your concern,
because this is just american labor 

3527
02:47:04,491 --> 02:47:04,491
conflict minerals.
It's going to.

3528
02:47:04,491 --> 02:47:08,680
There's one company that was making an 
android phone that was like karma free 

3529
02:47:08,680 --> 02:47:09,340
phone or something like that.
Wasn'T it?

3530
02:47:09,340 --> 02:47:11,260
Something like along those lines,
but everyone's like,

3531
02:47:12,010 --> 02:47:16,930
how good.
The camera had only had like three g.

3532
02:47:16,931 --> 02:47:20,310
It was like a test of how much.
How much do you care?

3533
02:47:20,350 --> 02:47:21,560
Fuck.
three g,

3534
02:47:22,630 --> 02:47:24,930
five g is right around the corner.
Okay.

3535
02:47:24,940 --> 02:47:26,980
You got to step up your game.
Karma phone.

3536
02:47:27,130 --> 02:47:27,860
By the way,
judge.

3537
02:47:27,880 --> 02:47:32,880
You know how many emails I get from dude
saying I listen to you in the joe rogan 

3538
02:47:32,880 --> 02:47:35,650
show and you are horribly unbecoming.
Swear too much.

3539
02:47:35,651 --> 02:47:37,690
You're not a lady.
You need to stop swearing.

3540
02:47:38,320 --> 02:47:43,320
And it makes me think what and would 
what a female ever be able to win any 

3541
02:47:43,691 --> 02:47:45,600
political office if a tape came out of 
them saying,

3542
02:47:45,640 --> 02:47:48,130
I grabbed men by the deq.
Yeah,

3543
02:47:48,131 --> 02:47:49,630
that's my kind of gal.
What if.

3544
02:47:49,740 --> 02:47:52,360
What if I looked like trump?
Oh no,

3545
02:47:52,780 --> 02:47:56,070
he didn't have like all that loose skin.
But if you look like you,

3546
02:47:56,740 --> 02:47:57,790
but like,
yeah,

3547
02:47:57,791 --> 02:47:58,600
go pussy riot.

3548
02:48:00,850 --> 02:48:02,770
That was pussy riot.
Girls are cute,

3549
02:48:02,800 --> 02:48:04,000
you know,
that's why it works.

3550
02:48:04,660 --> 02:48:06,610
Yeah.
You know it's true.

3551
02:48:06,611 --> 02:48:07,150
I mean,
look,

3552
02:48:07,151 --> 02:48:09,070
there's a,
there's a lot of shallow thinking.

3553
02:48:09,120 --> 02:48:09,790
Yeah,
in,

3554
02:48:09,791 --> 02:48:13,570
in pretty much every part of the world.
I mean human beings are involved in this

3555
02:48:14,050 --> 02:48:19,050
weird sort of a race for,
for resources and for breeding rights 

3556
02:48:19,901 --> 02:48:21,250
and for,
you know,

3557
02:48:21,550 --> 02:48:24,700
for social,
social position.

3558
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:27,430
There's a lot of weird shit going on 
with people and we're,

3559
02:48:27,431 --> 02:48:32,431
we're,
we're like in some weird stage of 

3560
02:48:32,431 --> 02:48:35,820
evolution where we're,
we're close to like getting better than 

3561
02:48:35,820 --> 02:48:37,420
we are now,
but we're not there yet.

3562
02:48:37,421 --> 02:48:40,480
And the trump thing is like a little 
slide back.

3563
02:48:40,481 --> 02:48:43,120
The longing for nostalgia,
you know,

3564
02:48:43,121 --> 02:48:47,340
we've kind of slid back a few steps but 
I always feel like my,

3565
02:48:47,400 --> 02:48:52,090
I mean my take on things is always that 
unless there's some sort of resistance,

3566
02:48:52,630 --> 02:48:56,920
the real hard work doesn't get done and 
I feel like this,

3567
02:48:57,110 --> 02:49:02,110
this situation that we're in right now,
which is really unappealing to a lot of 

3568
02:49:02,110 --> 02:49:04,600
us is going to force people to activate 
politically,

3569
02:49:04,720 --> 02:49:08,280
socially and gas.
And also I think

3570
02:49:08,280 --> 02:49:13,280
like this berkeley shit that's going on 
these riots and everything is going to 

3571
02:49:13,280 --> 02:49:13,470
force people to reexamine the way they 
interact with each other.

3572
02:49:13,480 --> 02:49:17,670
Like this is not the functional way,
this is not a good way to interact.

3573
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:23,000
And that's where I think we were talking
about like what's important about this,

3574
02:49:23,401 --> 02:49:28,401
um,
regressive left ideology and addressing 

3575
02:49:28,401 --> 02:49:29,520
it and say it's important because it 
fuels the right,

3576
02:49:29,790 --> 02:49:33,750
it fuels these alt right people to have 
some sort of regressed.

3577
02:49:33,751 --> 02:49:36,690
Like literally what the outright to 
based on the notion of.

3578
02:49:36,691 --> 02:49:37,320
Yeah.
Yeah.

3579
02:49:37,430 --> 02:49:39,810
I mean it really is.
Listen,

3580
02:49:40,380 --> 02:49:41,420
you're awesome.
I always love.

3581
02:49:41,640 --> 02:49:44,340
I always love having you on this time.
I was like,

3582
02:49:44,341 --> 02:49:49,341
I need to say more things now.
It's really depressing and clinical 

3583
02:49:49,341 --> 02:49:53,970
prime.
Debbie martin and he didn't say shit 

3584
02:49:53,970 --> 02:49:54,250
about sam harris,
so won't send me any horrible text.

3585
02:49:54,540 --> 02:49:55,920
Would you ever get together with him?

3586
02:49:55,950 --> 02:49:57,660
Would you ever do a podcast with him and
talk to him?

3587
02:49:57,661 --> 02:49:59,580
He's a very reasonable guy.
I swear to god he is.

3588
02:49:59,620 --> 02:50:04,620
I mean,
the thing is that is his followers are 

3589
02:50:04,620 --> 02:50:07,500
just so crazy hidden,
sort of not like not like his man.

3590
02:50:07,501 --> 02:50:08,610
I mean,
wow,

3591
02:50:10,500 --> 02:50:12,620
I'm sure he's a nice guy,
but dance,

3592
02:50:13,020 --> 02:50:17,380
I think he feels like you misrepresent 
what he says and then he presents it.

3593
02:50:17,381 --> 02:50:18,840
I say.
I mean he basically,

3594
02:50:18,841 --> 02:50:23,841
his whole argument was,
was tearing apart me tearing apart 

3595
02:50:23,841 --> 02:50:25,290
official military data and statistics,
which is complete bullshit.

3596
02:50:25,291 --> 02:50:28,020
Anyone who believes the military and 
pentagon statistics come on,

3597
02:50:29,030 --> 02:50:30,860
you don't think they fucking let you 
think that 70,000

3598
02:50:30,880 --> 02:50:31,830
numbers.
Correct?

3599
02:50:32,370 --> 02:50:34,770
Well,
they only got a few civilians.

3600
02:50:34,800 --> 02:50:38,040
It was a little surgical.
I understand.

3601
02:50:38,041 --> 02:50:40,020
Look by a lot of my friends love sam 
harris.

3602
02:50:40,021 --> 02:50:45,021
They love his philosophy 100 percent,
but when it comes to politics that you 

3603
02:50:45,021 --> 02:50:45,330
know,
there's a different jive.

3604
02:50:45,420 --> 02:50:48,210
I think it'd be funny having two guys go
out at though.

3605
02:50:48,540 --> 02:50:49,650
It wouldn't be funny.
Be interesting.

3606
02:50:49,680 --> 02:50:50,640
It'd be.
It'd be interesting.

3607
02:50:50,641 --> 02:50:51,870
It'd be funny.
Interesting.

3608
02:50:52,050 --> 02:50:53,940
What'd you do it would you be doing 
about it?

3609
02:50:54,350 --> 02:50:55,530
I'll think about it.
No pressure.

3610
02:50:55,590 --> 02:50:56,670
I'll think about it.
Pressure.

3611
02:50:57,150 --> 02:50:58,950
It wouldn't be fun.
It actually would be fun.

3612
02:50:59,490 --> 02:51:00,740
Well,
I'm glad you're back.

3613
02:51:01,020 --> 02:51:02,070
It was fun.
I enjoyed it.

3614
02:51:02,940 --> 02:51:04,020
Martin,
ladies and gentlemen,

3615
02:51:04,200 --> 02:51:06,270
the empire files.
Check it out on youtube.

3616
02:51:06,680 --> 02:51:11,680
Uh,
we'll be back tomorrow with my pal dan 

3617
02:51:11,680 --> 02:51:11,680
dodi city.
