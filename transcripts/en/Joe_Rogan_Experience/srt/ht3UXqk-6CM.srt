1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,620
Vacation with your family?
Yeah,

2
00:00:01,621 --> 00:00:02,970
we're going to Lanai.
Oh,

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,290
that'd be fun.
Yeah.

4
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:06,870
Boom.
And we're alive.

5
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:10,020
Speaking of vacations,
tell me about Guyana.

6
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,670
Yeah,
that's a good segue.

7
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,240
He'd been there a bunch,
you know,

8
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,620
I thought it was three.
No,

9
00:00:15,621 --> 00:00:16,510
why was in.
No,

10
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:21,550
I've been to Guyana twice,
but between there I went to Bolivia and

11
00:00:21,691 --> 00:00:24,690
did like very similar,
very similar kind of trip,

12
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,770
like doing a river trip with
Amerindians.

13
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,740
Are those people weirded out by
Americans?

14
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,880
Because the Jonestown massacre thing.
It's so funny you bring up jealous town

15
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,650
because there's a couple things that
been like,

16
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:40,263
uh,

17
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,220
[inaudible].
So the,

18
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,740
the,
the main group I was with in Guyana,

19
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,200
um,
isn't the,

20
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:51,550
and I'll surprise one day when I was a,
they make a dish,

21
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:54,940
they make a dish with cassava,
which is a route like maniac.

22
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:56,830
Um,
they make a dish with that.

23
00:00:56,831 --> 00:00:58,540
They make a flower from it and make a
dish.

24
00:00:58,541 --> 00:00:59,950
And I was one day saying that,
hey,

25
00:00:59,951 --> 00:01:02,170
that's a little.
It looks like pizza,

26
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:04,000
right?
No,

27
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:05,213
right,
right.

28
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,880
No comprehension.
But like,

29
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:09,490
no thought of what pizza is.
I remember thinking like,

30
00:01:09,491 --> 00:01:10,270
wow man,
like something,

31
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:11,530
you take such a,
you know,

32
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:14,500
you just consider such a part of
everyday life.

33
00:01:14,501 --> 00:01:16,060
It's good to know what it was.
Yeah.

34
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,430
And they don't know about Georgetown.
Whoa.

35
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,330
Even though was in their own country,
they don't know about it at all.

36
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:23,380
No,
it's just not.

37
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,690
But yet like what,
we'll get into this,

38
00:01:25,691 --> 00:01:28,540
but you got to like realize sort of how
insular,

39
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:34,240
you know,
at the Amerindian communities are who

40
00:01:34,241 --> 00:01:37,570
live in the,
in the jungle in Guyana,

41
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,680
the,
they have communication on any new yet

42
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:41,470
more and more now.

43
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:43,360
And there's a lot,
a lot changed.

44
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:46,000
The two times I went there with five or
six years apart,

45
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,490
they discovered sunglasses and I've
ever.

46
00:01:48,491 --> 00:01:51,480
The first time I was down there trying
to turn them on because uh,

47
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:52,670
you know,
they,

48
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:54,820
they,
they bow hunt for fish,

49
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,530
right?
Which one of the main ways they get

50
00:01:56,531 --> 00:01:59,020
phished bow hunting for fish.
And when you're looking into the water,

51
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:04,710
polarized lenses are invaluable.
I feel lost without fish underwater.

52
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,780
And I kept saying,
man,

53
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,860
you got to get on board with polarized
sunglasses.

54
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,790
Not Hand in to.
And he,

55
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,570
he didn't like it,
this guy wrote and he didn't like

56
00:02:13,571 --> 00:02:16,390
anything about having them on his face,
he just couldn't do it.

57
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,970
But then I go down to five years later
and um,

58
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,700
everyone of those boys is rocket
polarized glasses.

59
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,620
So you see changes.
But yeah,

60
00:02:23,621 --> 00:02:24,430
that's the thing.

61
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:28,630
Like I've brought up Jonestown a number
of times because in the US,

62
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,531
if you say,
Hey,

63
00:02:29,531 --> 00:02:31,480
I'm going to Guyana,
all anybody says don't drink the

64
00:02:31,481 --> 00:02:32,440
Koolaid.
Right?

65
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:36,460
Really cool aid.
It was some like who late?

66
00:02:36,461 --> 00:02:38,170
No,
it was a Koolaid type.

67
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,281
No,
no.

68
00:02:39,281 --> 00:02:43,000
So when people look at when we had this
conversation,

69
00:02:43,001 --> 00:02:44,530
because there's a couple of things that
are important here.

70
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:46,450
What the poison was,
right?

71
00:02:46,451 --> 00:02:51,360
So we had a conversation,
I looked back up the route,

72
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:52,061
I mentioned.
Sure.

73
00:02:52,061 --> 00:02:53,200
That they make a sava.
Yeah.

74
00:02:53,201 --> 00:02:57,370
So there's a root cassava and stuff.
So it's the route that gives all life.

75
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,050
They eat,
they call it.

76
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:02,560
No,
but I mean they eat fish and game.

77
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:06,640
Okay.
River fish and wild game.

78
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:08,870
And then that's like a staple the data
everyday.

79
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:13,810
And the other thing,
the everyday is a half dozen things all

80
00:03:13,811 --> 00:03:17,410
produced from cassava,
which is kind of like a Yam and it's

81
00:03:17,411 --> 00:03:21,310
cultivated with slash and burn
agriculture and they cultivate these

82
00:03:21,311 --> 00:03:24,000
yams and from it they make a flower.

83
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,950
Um,
they make a type of grain.

84
00:03:26,951 --> 00:03:31,951
It's like cous cous.
They make a syrup that's used as a

85
00:03:32,741 --> 00:03:37,741
coloring agent in a flavoring agent.
They make a non alcoholic drink,

86
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:41,710
they make a somewhat alcoholic drink
that would be like an equivalent to

87
00:03:41,711 --> 00:03:44,350
beer.
And then they make a much more alcoholic

88
00:03:44,351 --> 00:03:46,920
drink,
which would be an equivalent like

89
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,880
fortified wine.
Wow.

90
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:51,640
They make all this stuff from this,
this route that they grow

91
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:58,210
in its raw form.
When you shred the root in squeeze the

92
00:03:58,211 --> 00:03:59,200
shredding.
So it'd be like,

93
00:03:59,201 --> 00:04:02,770
imagine you took a Yam and shredded a
yam and then squeeze the amd between

94
00:04:02,771 --> 00:04:05,800
your hands and tripped out of liquid.
That liquid is deadly poisonous.

95
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,780
Okay.
Dogs,

96
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,220
chickens,
people,

97
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,460
anything that drinks that liquid dies.
Jesus.

98
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:16,510
And it's cyanide.
So the Jonestown massacre,

99
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:22,140
uh,
it was a cocktail of the best.

100
00:04:22,391 --> 00:04:27,391
People think that it was koolaid flavor,
aid volume and potassium.

101
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:34,240
Cyanide,
my question coming home from Ghana was

102
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:35,123
like,
did they,

103
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:40,200
was the cyanide from the route where
they like doing homemade cyanide,

104
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,330
but,
and so when I got home I looked into

105
00:04:43,331 --> 00:04:46,180
this and it's the,
and it seems as though that commune,

106
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,600
Jonestown commune had been ordering
actual potassium cyanide,

107
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:56,110
which is used in a number of mining
practices and other stuff.

108
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:57,640
So it's,
it's an available,

109
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,750
it's an available compound and dance.
They laced the Koolaid width.

110
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,730
I'd heard about this cassava stuff.
And what,

111
00:05:03,731 --> 00:05:06,760
do they know what the process is like?
Did they know,

112
00:05:06,761 --> 00:05:10,150
like how people figured out how to make
it non poisonous and help.

113
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,130
Wow.
It's just been done so long.

114
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,470
Yeah.
And the same stuff with like different

115
00:05:14,471 --> 00:05:18,760
poisons they use to poison the that
people use to poison fish.

116
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:23,680
What strikes me about it is how in the
village,

117
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:24,530
like the,
the,

118
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:26,890
the,
the Macusa village I was in,

119
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,380
um,
is mostly Macusa,

120
00:05:29,381 --> 00:05:32,290
but there's also like Wapa Shoshana,
which is another tribe.

121
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:35,830
Carob is no our tribe,
but it's predominantly a Macusa village

122
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,080
and there's about 300 people with the
live in this village

123
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,100
and how careless they are with the
liquid.

124
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:48,260
Like if you nowadays like picture,
like you're like the type of person to

125
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:52,270
like you and me are married to and raise
kids with.

126
00:05:52,271 --> 00:05:55,690
Right.
If you had that type of mom and you had

127
00:05:55,691 --> 00:06:00,260
a big bowl of liquid that would kill you
if you drank a bit.

128
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,910
How that bowl would be monitored in your
household?

129
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,850
Jesus Christ,
that'd be like barbed wire around it.

130
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:11,930
Electrical fence and how do they sit?
Just Lazy.

131
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,270
They just lay it out and I said I was
asked.

132
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:17,700
This guy wrote them at him and I kept
returning to this.

133
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,580
There's certain things I can always ask
and it just like things that he

134
00:06:20,581 --> 00:06:22,730
struggled to understand my fixation on
it,

135
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,970
but I kept saying to this Macusa Guy
Rove,

136
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:29,780
who I should back up too.

137
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,840
I got communication.
So guy out is.

138
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:34,250
It's the only English speaking country
in South America.

139
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,810
Everyone's got.
No,

140
00:06:35,811 --> 00:06:36,230
no.
The,

141
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,180
the,
the government functions or English.

142
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,270
So if you,
if you picture yourself America,

143
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:46,310
it's northeast corner opening out onto
the southern Caribbean.

144
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:49,910
That's guy on,
it's bordered on the east by

145
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:53,840
[inaudible].
I'm on the West by Venezuela to the

146
00:06:53,841 --> 00:06:58,841
south by Brazil.
It's 90 percent virgin rain forest and

147
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:02,540
within that 90 percent of virgin
rainforest is only 10 percent of the

148
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:06,710
population.
So the coastal people's are like creole

149
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:08,960
cultures.
People mostly descended from slave

150
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:12,680
trade.
Europeans in the interior are the

151
00:07:12,681 --> 00:07:17,681
Amerindian groups and um,
the government functions sort of the

152
00:07:18,081 --> 00:07:22,190
power in,
in Guyana is that as the coastal peoples

153
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:26,570
and there's not a ton of interest and it
used to be barely any interplay between

154
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:29,000
the Amerindian communities in the
government,

155
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:32,420
the government's English speaking.
So in,

156
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:35,300
you'll find that there's a lot of
English mixed in,

157
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,550
in the Amerindian communities in some
people like this Guy Rovan because he's

158
00:07:39,551 --> 00:07:41,080
sort of a upping.

159
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:41,990
He,
he's like a,

160
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,390
he has a leadership role in his
community and he's learned just standard

161
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:51,140
English very well.
He's had a fascinating life.

162
00:07:51,141 --> 00:07:54,200
Just how much stuff has changed for him.
Uh,

163
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,060
so I,
you can just converse.

164
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:00,950
Okay.
In a way that you can converse in like

165
00:08:00,951 --> 00:08:04,010
an a type of the type of English we're
talking right now almost,

166
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:08,930
which creates this weird tension between
the things that you're discussing and

167
00:08:08,931 --> 00:08:11,420
how you're discussing them.
Like for instance,

168
00:08:11,421 --> 00:08:16,400
to have a guy just in conversational
English talking about problems they're

169
00:08:16,401 --> 00:08:19,340
having with neighboring shamans in their
own shaman,

170
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:23,570
putting curses on each other and it like
creates like there's like a strange

171
00:08:23,571 --> 00:08:26,690
tension between like how it's being
conveyed to you,

172
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:30,200
you know,
like how so like,

173
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,840
okay,
if you're talking conversational

174
00:08:32,841 --> 00:08:34,550
English,
I guess like a life.

175
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:37,610
It's almost like you'd want it to be
when he's telling you this,

176
00:08:37,611 --> 00:08:42,611
you'd almost want to be reading it in
like closed caption and he'd be saying

177
00:08:43,101 --> 00:08:46,760
it in the indigenous language because it
sounds weird to have to,

178
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:51,910
to have an idea that's so foreign to us,
which would be like a battle of shamans

179
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:55,350
battling over access to wild animals.

180
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,150
Okay.
Um,

181
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,930
to have that delivered in conversational
English just struck me as unusual

182
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,070
because usually when you're traveling,
you're getting all of your information

183
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,750
like traveling and Bolivia.
A guy would tell a story and he'd tell a

184
00:09:09,751 --> 00:09:11,780
story in,
um,

185
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,450
Tsimshian no one was saying that Shan
Chimani.

186
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:19,140
Okay.
He tells story in Chimani to a person

187
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:22,650
who spoke Spanish.
The person who speaks Spanish would tell

188
00:09:22,651 --> 00:09:25,800
it to a person.
No,

189
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:26,031
no,
no,

190
00:09:26,031 --> 00:09:29,220
no.
Chimani guy telling someone who speaks

191
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:32,940
Spanish.
Then that person telling it

192
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:38,340
to a person who speaks Spanish and
English and then that person giving you

193
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:42,630
the information.
When you get it through that it takes on

194
00:09:42,631 --> 00:09:46,370
a mythical quality.
Like you're crossing some space time

195
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,760
thing.
Right.

196
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:51,960
We're seeing like these ideas discussed
in their ancestral tongue.

197
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:53,580
Okay.
Yeah.

198
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,090
Do you remember I sent you a video of a
guy talking about killing a Jaguar?

199
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,080
Yes.
Right.

200
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:00,670
The language you've never.
Like when he's speaking,

201
00:10:00,671 --> 00:10:02,430
you're like,
I've never in all my travels,

202
00:10:02,431 --> 00:10:05,520
I'd never heard of language.
It sounds anything like that is a video

203
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:06,410
online.
Can we play that?

204
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,490
It's online.
What was,

205
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,210
do you know the title of it?
It's a,

206
00:10:09,211 --> 00:10:10,950
I think if you type in like,
um,

207
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:16,330
Chimani t,
s I Chimani Jaguar,

208
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:19,620
seatac.
See if Jamie can you pull it up?

209
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,310
It's very cool.
The language is really amazing.

210
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:24,210
Seem so ancient.
Yes.

211
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,390
It's not like has nothing to do with
like the Latin languages.

212
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,240
Just sound.
So it's very unique.

213
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:33,060
So I guess what I'm getting at is to
hear someone talking about something in

214
00:10:33,061 --> 00:10:38,040
conversational English that seems so far
removed from just our understanding of

215
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:39,930
things.
It takes on a weird quality.

216
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:44,070
But what's nice about it is you can go
to a place where life is so vastly

217
00:10:44,071 --> 00:10:46,650
different than anything we understand
and,

218
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:51,420
and just get like the straight dope
right from the source is why I love is

219
00:10:51,421 --> 00:10:55,640
Kinda like what's so cool about Guyana
because you can go and converse with

220
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:59,940
people who are very much a hunter
gatherer culture today,

221
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:04,050
but just shoot the shit with them
without ever feeling like you're missing

222
00:11:04,051 --> 00:11:06,270
something.
It's like the.

223
00:11:06,271 --> 00:11:10,480
Everything's not lost in translation and
all weird and garbled and in like

224
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:15,450
painstaking to wade through.
But you can just ask like,

225
00:11:15,451 --> 00:11:16,860
hey,
what's up with the local shyman?

226
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:21,630
I'll give you the dope on the Lord.
And so they trade spells.

227
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,681
Yeah.
Well yeah,

228
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:23,481
we'll talk about that.
But I,

229
00:11:23,481 --> 00:11:25,770
I feel like I was laying the groundwork
for a,

230
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:29,410
the Jim Jones poison.
You find the video?

231
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,460
I thought I lost the word that you were
spelling.

232
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,010
T S I m a n e

233
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,580
t s I m a n e.
What does that mean?

234
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,670
Chimani.
That's how they spell it out.

235
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,730
Or they're being screwed up.
Yeah.

236
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:47,120
You spell a lot worse when you're not
actually writing it out.

237
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,230
Yeah,
I'm terrible.

238
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,820
I don't know how anybody wins a spelling
bee ever.

239
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:54,190
Toumani Tsi.

240
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:57,040
Yeah.
So if you type in Chimani Jaguar,

241
00:11:57,041 --> 00:12:00,700
t s I m a n e Jaguar.

242
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:02,143
Wow.

243
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,700
The whole thing is an Amerindian hunter
remembers his best dog lost to a Jaguar

244
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:09,410
in the jungles of Bolivia.
Okay,

245
00:12:09,411 --> 00:12:11,030
here we go.
Let's play this because it's fucking

246
00:12:11,031 --> 00:12:11,864
awesome.

247
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:13,403
Here we go.

248
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:20,100
Following is an interview with a member
of the tribe of Bolivia.

249
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,300
Do their inherent difficulties of
translating indigenous languages.

250
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:28,310
Subtitles are at times approximate
income.

251
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:41,880
So he's explaining where he's
saying he hunts for food.

252
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:47,190
I always share that with my family.
I'm a good provider of me cutting up the

253
00:12:47,191 --> 00:12:52,050
meat in this video.
I also enjoyed the adventure.

254
00:12:52,051 --> 00:12:57,051
I love trekking through the jungle.
Once I was hunting with my favorite dog

255
00:12:57,251 --> 00:13:00,710
and a couple of the dogs that ran ahead,
barking,

256
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:04,150
they were going after something you meet
kit you.

257
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:07,690
All of a sudden my favorite dog just
went completely silent.

258
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:13,970
There were about 50 meters ahead of me
and I got to the other dogs had gone

259
00:13:13,971 --> 00:13:17,600
ahead after something
to hear.

260
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:20,180
Can You
keep

261
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:23,790
saying my favorite dogs laying there
dead.

262
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:26,920
There was a big homeless right side.
Almost looked like it had been arrowed

263
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,680
if we didn't get,
the first thing I did was pick up my dog

264
00:13:30,681 --> 00:13:32,590
and said them where the ants wouldn't
get those body.

265
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:39,090
That dog was the bravest one I had.
I'm not going to translate information

266
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,090
that's just watching the video if you're
interested,

267
00:13:43,091 --> 00:13:47,660
but you get a sense of how cool it is.
So the recover.

268
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:49,450
Do we fully cover the poison things?
No,

269
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,010
not really.
So I got home it yet,

270
00:13:51,011 --> 00:13:52,420
so it wasn't the same poison,
but

271
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:56,050
Jim Jones,
uh,

272
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:57,030
he grew up in like,
uh,

273
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:59,170
he,
he was involved in a pentecostal church.

274
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:04,171
He's involved in the methodist church.
Then he kind of became a healer and

275
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,720
started his own cult.
It was funny.

276
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:09,910
I was reading about him when I was
trying to figure out the poison.

277
00:14:09,911 --> 00:14:12,820
I was reading about how he was kind of
ahead of his time because the Jim Jones

278
00:14:12,821 --> 00:14:17,821
massacre in 1979 and a 78 or 79 and one
thing to guide them sideways,

279
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:23,830
but with his church was that he wanted
to have an interracial service.

280
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,160
Wow.
And that caused friction in his church

281
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:32,200
at the time earlier in his career and he
moved out to the bay area and started

282
00:14:32,201 --> 00:14:35,230
this church and then he got like kind of
paranoid and thought that his

283
00:14:35,231 --> 00:14:38,110
congregants shouldn't be engaging in
sexual activities,

284
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:41,140
but he had,
he was syring illegitimate children left

285
00:14:41,141 --> 00:14:43,180
and right.
They go down to Guyana,

286
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,440
go out to the jungle,
you know,

287
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:49,590
a thousand of them down there.
People in the US from the bay area kind

288
00:14:49,591 --> 00:14:50,950
kinda like wondering what happened to
their loved.

289
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:56,390
They send a congressman down there to
try to figure out what's going on.

290
00:14:56,391 --> 00:14:59,720
He shows up with a bunch of cameras.
The congressman says,

291
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:00,560
you know,
he's like,

292
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,540
I'm going to help anyone who wants to go
back to the bay area,

293
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,270
go back to the bay area.
He goes to the airstrip.

294
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:07,670
It was a shootout.
The congress,

295
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:12,200
the US congressmen gets killed in the
shootout and then data all start killing

296
00:15:12,201 --> 00:15:17,201
themselves with the poison and firearms
and other shit.

297
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:21,110
Two hundred and 70 some kids over 900
people.

298
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:22,680
Yeah,
I remember.

299
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,920
It's like the defining thing,
but then yeah,

300
00:15:24,921 --> 00:15:26,480
when you talk to these boys,
I'm like,

301
00:15:26,481 --> 00:15:27,410
you know,
Georgetown,

302
00:15:27,411 --> 00:15:28,920
like the Jonestown,
you know,

303
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:32,660
the Jim Jones,
Jonestown massacre and never drink the

304
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,493
Koolaid to like,
no.

305
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:36,730
See,
I had heard it was budget koolaid.

306
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:37,990
No,
that's the summit.

307
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:41,210
It was an I.
and that's a debate and in trying to

308
00:15:41,211 --> 00:15:44,790
find like trying to like dig around and
find the source of the cyanide,

309
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,150
which became very important to me to
learn for some reason.

310
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,400
Um,
no,

311
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,060
I think Koolaid even tried to distance
himself from it was.

312
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:55,370
But they,
there's some archival stuff and I guess

313
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:59,540
in this archival stuff,
images like footage taken around and

314
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:03,140
photographs around,
people have found out that they had both

315
00:16:03,141 --> 00:16:07,880
flavor aid and Koolaid on hand.
That's hilarious.

316
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,130
What it was.
Koolaid propaganda that's trying to pass

317
00:16:10,131 --> 00:16:12,440
the buck on the flavor aid.
So yeah,

318
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:13,850
no,
no thing there.

319
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:18,080
And if you could.
So if you go up the main river that

320
00:16:18,081 --> 00:16:22,340
drains the main river,
that drains guy on his elbow and if you

321
00:16:22,341 --> 00:16:24,620
go way up the ESC,
Weebo and um,

322
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:27,140
you know,
you'll get to in a stream that comes in

323
00:16:27,141 --> 00:16:30,140
from there called the roup annuity and
you go up the roof annuity and then you

324
00:16:30,141 --> 00:16:34,640
get to the reward and at the mouth of
the [inaudible] in Rupa Nuni is real

325
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:38,900
village.
And in [inaudible] village you're a

326
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:44,860
isolated enough where you don't know
about 900 Americans and in some other

327
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,180
people from other areas night,
you know,

328
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:49,160
dying in a mass suicide.

329
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:52,160
Wow.
That's around the time you were born.

330
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:55,340
That's fascinating that it's why it
makes sense though,

331
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,140
that they're just so removed from it.
Know.

332
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,330
Do they,
um,

333
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:01,730
do they use agriculture,
like how are they getting this esop day

334
00:17:01,731 --> 00:17:05,720
grow peppers and then they grow the
cassava and the cassava,

335
00:17:05,721 --> 00:17:07,970
like it's kind of amazing.
Um,

336
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,370
you know,
we always hear about slash and burn

337
00:17:10,371 --> 00:17:15,371
agriculture so they'll,
they'll go in and do a slash and burn in

338
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,610
the spot out in the jungle.
Um,

339
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,080
but it's like,
it's like a recycled sort of slash and

340
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:22,970
burn agriculture and I'll break down
what that means.

341
00:17:22,971 --> 00:17:26,810
So they'll go into an area and slash
everything and burden just to clear the,

342
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,850
just so sunlight can make it through to
the ground.

343
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:31,220
So they chopped the jungle down and burn
everything.

344
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:34,760
Then the cassava,
like I said,

345
00:17:34,761 --> 00:17:39,761
it looks like big yams when you grow it,
you just take a stock of an existing

346
00:17:40,521 --> 00:17:44,240
plant
and just bury that stock in the ground.

347
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,850
It will sprout up a new crop and so you
know,

348
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,540
you're close to the equator so you don't
have seasons as much.

349
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:56,340
There's some seasonal variation.
They do have times that they do have

350
00:17:56,341 --> 00:18:00,210
like they are wet season and dry season,
but it's like you always get about the

351
00:18:00,211 --> 00:18:04,380
same amount of darkness as daylight and
they don't have the wild fluctuations

352
00:18:04,381 --> 00:18:08,700
that we have in the temperate zone so
they can grow year round and they stage

353
00:18:08,701 --> 00:18:10,380
it.
So you know you have a crop that's

354
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:12,410
coming in,
you have a crop that will become an in

355
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,990
three months.
You have a crop that will be coming in

356
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,660
six months.
You have a crop that becoming a nine

357
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:18,600
months and once you get a certain number
of cycles,

358
00:18:18,601 --> 00:18:20,610
I can't remember how many cycles you get
off a piece of ground.

359
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:25,920
You let the ground go feral,
give it a few years and then come in and

360
00:18:25,921 --> 00:18:26,754
burn it again.

361
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:29,580
Also intermittently,
every time you plant cassava,

362
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:33,570
you before you replant,
you make a little fire and burn some

363
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:36,690
debris in that same spot.
No irrigation.

364
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:39,720
You're not watering it at all.
Um,

365
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,900
and that's the only fertilize you're
giving it as you're burning some of the

366
00:18:42,901 --> 00:18:47,810
surrounding just detritus scraped up
from the jungle floor that you burned

367
00:18:47,811 --> 00:18:52,811
there and grow it.
And it is a staple of life that in river

368
00:18:53,641 --> 00:18:57,480
fish and game,
it's just such a wild thing that it's

369
00:18:57,481 --> 00:18:59,550
such a poisonous plant.
I don't get it.

370
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,130
I don't get it.
There's all this stuff that there's

371
00:19:02,131 --> 00:19:06,000
other poisons that are extracted.
I'm like people that,

372
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:08,550
people,
that people in South America and the

373
00:19:08,551 --> 00:19:11,100
jungles,
people that use blow darts so people to

374
00:19:11,101 --> 00:19:13,590
hunt with blowguns is generally
understood.

375
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:17,670
Like even talking to even talking to
them Macusa who hunt with bows and

376
00:19:17,671 --> 00:19:19,470
arrows.
I asked them like,

377
00:19:19,471 --> 00:19:21,630
why don't you guys hunt with blow darts?

378
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,880
Blowguns?
And he explained me,

379
00:19:23,881 --> 00:19:26,580
we don't need to because we have
aeroplan,

380
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:30,720
which gives arrows.
Now if you were in this other area,

381
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:34,050
you know,
more up in the mountains and there's no

382
00:19:34,051 --> 00:19:36,210
Arrow plant,
then you'd hunt with a blow dart.

383
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:38,910
So is aeroplan just to plant that makes
like a shaft,

384
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:41,700
like makes the Arrow what it,
what is it?

385
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,130
What is the type?
It's like a cane.

386
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,560
Well you know what it looks,
it looks,

387
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:48,360
it looks like a,
it looks like a palm.

388
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:52,320
And the palm leaf puts out these long
pieces in one.

389
00:19:52,321 --> 00:19:56,460
One of those is ready you,
you caught it green and then they can

390
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:58,260
make an Arrow no time.
So you go out of the jungle,

391
00:19:58,261 --> 00:20:01,110
find this piece and you're like,
like,

392
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:03,600
like you know,
like one of the theories on how we

393
00:20:03,601 --> 00:20:08,250
domesticated plants species would be
that it was a very gradual,

394
00:20:08,251 --> 00:20:12,540
unintentional domestication where you
would go out,

395
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:15,240
I'm going to just take something simple
like let's say a lot of raspberries.

396
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,940
Okay.
You go out and you gather raspberries

397
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:22,410
and you bring them home and you eat them
near home and then people are eating

398
00:20:22,411 --> 00:20:26,740
these seeds and shitting these seeds out
and pretty soon there's a lot more grass

399
00:20:26,741 --> 00:20:31,741
berries growing around your home village
just for the simple fact that you always

400
00:20:32,881 --> 00:20:35,550
bring the seeds home and discarding them
around in,

401
00:20:35,551 --> 00:20:40,551
in creating it so they have it except
for maniac,

402
00:20:42,091 --> 00:20:44,100
which people don't even really.
I don't think it's really well

403
00:20:44,101 --> 00:20:47,470
understood what it came from.
It's been domesticated for long time.

404
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:51,370
All the plants they use are widely
available in the jungle,

405
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,910
but tend to also have some around home
to that they've brought home and plant

406
00:20:55,911 --> 00:20:59,590
in nearby or they just grow up there now
because they've been bringing this stuff

407
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:03,430
into their village for so long.
So aero plant is readily available.

408
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:08,380
Um,
they cut the Arrow shaft green and it

409
00:21:08,381 --> 00:21:12,580
looks like just a green dial,
but it has some curvature to it.

410
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:18,090
Then no come home and they start a fire
and they heat the green thing just by

411
00:21:18,341 --> 00:21:20,440
twirling it over.
The,

412
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:24,880
over the embers are over the flame
twirling it and getting it hot and it'll

413
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:29,170
let off a little steam.
And then you bend it in a neutral and

414
00:21:29,171 --> 00:21:31,360
get a hot and bend it.
And you'll eventually make it,

415
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:37,140
well arrow straight.
Then the they make for different kinds

416
00:21:38,591 --> 00:21:40,090
of arrows depending on what they're
hunting for.

417
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:44,840
So let's say you were making a arrow to
a,

418
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,480
it gives you more.
Let's say you're making a big game

419
00:21:48,481 --> 00:21:49,470
arrow.
All right?

420
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:53,980
I'm in the big game they hoped would be
red brocket deer,

421
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:57,190
white lip packery,
which is a favorite,

422
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,980
um,
collared Peccary,

423
00:21:59,981 --> 00:22:04,060
which we call have Alina and sometimes
tape here.

424
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:06,200
The,
the,

425
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,200
the air they use for that,
so they would take that.

426
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:09,670
So let's say they're going to build one
of those,

427
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:11,530
so they take that green shaft and
straighten it.

428
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:16,860
The next step is they find a wood called
bullet wood and they cut what would be

429
00:22:17,021 --> 00:22:22,021
like a,
what's going to form the base of your

430
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,970
tip,
the base,

431
00:22:24,971 --> 00:22:29,680
your spear and that bullet would,
they fit into the end of the green

432
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,580
shaft,
which is almost like a picture to having

433
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:35,320
the consistency of bamboo and they
shoved that bullet would nair and it

434
00:22:35,321 --> 00:22:37,690
causes,
it forms like a base into that.

435
00:22:37,691 --> 00:22:42,340
They take an old machete blade,
did they cut out and file down to be

436
00:22:42,341 --> 00:22:47,341
about a four inch steel knife?
And that goes in to the bullet would to,

437
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:53,440
to the forms the junction between the
Arrow shaft and the steel piece.

438
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,890
That's the only man made material they
use in their arrows.

439
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:02,640
Then they take a plant that looks like
Jaco and they make their own string and

440
00:23:03,011 --> 00:23:06,970
they got little bits of rubber from
rubber trees that they wax the string

441
00:23:06,971 --> 00:23:11,640
with and they put a bullet would knock
in the part that that you're,

442
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:16,090
that you're bolstering actually pushes
on and that gets tied in to the Arrow

443
00:23:16,091 --> 00:23:19,600
shaft and then they fletched Arrow with
feathers,

444
00:23:19,601 --> 00:23:24,601
some Guan or black Curacao or crustless
Curacao and that's what they fletch

445
00:23:26,241 --> 00:23:28,480
their arrows with because they have,
they're very water resistant.

446
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:30,820
So they're broad heads are made at a
machete.

447
00:23:30,821 --> 00:23:31,654
Bleeds.
Yeah.

448
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:34,630
And this is a recent innovation for use
to use wood.

449
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:38,380
And how long have they been doing it
with machete bleeds in his lifetime,

450
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:39,970
it's always been.
They don't call them,

451
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:42,520
they come cutlasses enrollments,
lifetime robbins,

452
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:44,560
32.
He's a kind of my main friend down there

453
00:23:44,561 --> 00:23:47,300
that hung out with both times.
I was down there in his lifetime.

454
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:53,290
He remembers people using.
He remembers people using blades,

455
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,970
which is made from like a bamboo,
like material.

456
00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:01,730
So it'd be like a convex spearpoint cut
out of bamboo and sharpened.

457
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:06,970
He remembers people using those,
but he had always used cutlass blades.

458
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:09,890
Wow.
Now in Bolivia,

459
00:24:09,891 --> 00:24:13,880
you'd see people who have,
who are just using the the old form.

460
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:18,290
There are other arrows when they make
arrows for hunting birds and they make

461
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:19,400
arrows for hunting fish.

462
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,820
The only man made material on those
arrows is hog wire fencing,

463
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,170
so basically wire fencing.
They snip out the hunks of wire,

464
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:32,030
smash it down till it's flat,
and then they can cut barbs and there to

465
00:24:32,031 --> 00:24:37,031
hunt birds and hunt fish or the bowl is
this not a laminate boat,

466
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:40,370
so they make a bowl by just cutting a
tree,

467
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:42,950
single piece,
a single stem tree,

468
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:48,560
shaving it down to what they're after
and then take that same Yucca plant,

469
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:52,280
pull out the fibers out of the Yucca
strands and make bold strings.

470
00:24:52,281 --> 00:24:55,040
That goes very quickly as well,
like we made a bolstering one day.

471
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:56,630
Wow.
Yeah.

472
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,630
You just,
they,

473
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:58,463
they,
they,

474
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:02,000
you take the strands and twisted like
imagine like you're rubbing your hands

475
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:04,640
to warm them up.
You got all those strands in your hands

476
00:25:04,641 --> 00:25:09,350
and you roll them and it makes singles
and it makes strands that are comprised

477
00:25:09,351 --> 00:25:09,681
of,
you know,

478
00:25:09,681 --> 00:25:13,310
a dozen fibers.
Then you start braiding up from there

479
00:25:13,311 --> 00:25:18,230
until you braid up a big long bow string
and that's how you string your boat.

480
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:21,650
So when they're shooting their bow,
like what's a long shot for them,

481
00:25:21,651 --> 00:25:22,930
like 15,
20 yards,

482
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:26,000
long shot,
long shot and the length of shot you're

483
00:25:26,001 --> 00:25:30,140
going to take sort of depends on um,
kind of depends on.

484
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,440
Well,
they don't really think like

485
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:35,900
the idea of the like that you're going
to wound it and it's going to get away.

486
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,730
Doesn't weigh on them very heavily.
Right?

487
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,580
Like in our culture and our hunting
culture here,

488
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:43,600
we've come to like really a,

489
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:48,740
the wound loss is something we do a lot
to avoid.

490
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:51,880
Okay.
There's a lot of talk where I don't,

491
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:54,530
you know,
you shouldn't be surprised to get a good

492
00:25:54,531 --> 00:25:57,110
hit.
You should know what's going to happen.

493
00:25:57,111 --> 00:25:59,420
Don't take shots that are too far away,
right?

494
00:25:59,421 --> 00:26:02,450
We really put a strong value on,
um,

495
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:05,300
when you let the air or go,
or when you let the bullet go,

496
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:09,110
you damn sure know the,
you're going to have a quick clean kill.

497
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,570
At least we,
we put a lot of value on that in

498
00:26:11,571 --> 00:26:13,880
practice.
Sometimes that stuff goes out the

499
00:26:13,881 --> 00:26:15,410
window,
but anyone would say that that's your

500
00:26:15,411 --> 00:26:18,110
goal.
I'm not on their mind.

501
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:21,070
You see them take some hail Mary's
right,

502
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:23,360
and they can shoot.
Like if you're,

503
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,990
if you're trying to shoot a bird,
all they're trying to do is get a

504
00:26:26,991 --> 00:26:30,500
warrior point.
So one of those arrows I described

505
00:26:30,501 --> 00:26:34,760
fitted with a long wire on the end,
cut out of a piece of steel fence with a

506
00:26:34,761 --> 00:26:39,761
barb with a couple of barb's filed into
it and that head is joined by string to

507
00:26:42,381 --> 00:26:45,270
the Arrow shaft so that once the head
makes contact,

508
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:46,830
the Arrow shaft can fall away.

509
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:50,880
But there's a string connecting the
arrowhead,

510
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:56,370
the wire barb to the Arrow shaft and
that allows the tangle up up in the

511
00:26:56,371 --> 00:26:58,500
trees.
So when they shoot,

512
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:01,440
all they really need to do is pick that
thing with that wire.

513
00:27:01,441 --> 00:27:06,270
Barb know that the bird or the hunt for
a large aquatic rodents,

514
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:11,220
knowing that the bird is going to get
tangled up in the trees overhead and

515
00:27:11,221 --> 00:27:12,990
that they can then climb up to go get
it.

516
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,640
Even then,
I think even shooting like that kind of

517
00:27:17,641 --> 00:27:19,200
thing where you're just trying to pick
the thing.

518
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,700
Thirty yards,
be very long.

519
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,570
Shoot and fish.
You're not shooting.

520
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:26,550
I mean shooting fish.
You're not really like bow fishing,

521
00:27:26,551 --> 00:27:28,840
which I've done a lot of in my life.
A 10 yard boat.

522
00:27:28,841 --> 00:27:30,480
Fishing shot is very far.
Yeah.

523
00:27:30,481 --> 00:27:31,470
You're right above them,
right?

524
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,670
Yeah.
Because you're shooting down into the

525
00:27:32,671 --> 00:27:33,504
water.

526
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:34,523
Now,
do they have,

527
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:36,780
do you have to judge when you're
shooting into the water,

528
00:27:36,781 --> 00:27:38,850
you have to judge differently,
right?

529
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:41,070
The way diffraction.
Unless that thing,

530
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:45,360
unless that fishes sunning um,
unless that fish is stunning and it's

531
00:27:45,361 --> 00:27:47,610
back at the surface of breaking the
surface,

532
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:50,820
uh,
you need to account for refraction.

533
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:55,110
So you're aiming way low.
Now if you've got a fish that's a fish

534
00:27:55,111 --> 00:27:57,930
two feet below,
the water surface is extremely hard to

535
00:27:57,931 --> 00:28:01,230
hit because it's so deep.
Your aim and like you're aiming at your

536
00:28:01,231 --> 00:28:02,500
boot.
Well,

537
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:03,900
I mean it feels like that,
you know,

538
00:28:03,901 --> 00:28:07,770
your aim and so there's a,
there's an equation so low you're aiming

539
00:28:07,771 --> 00:28:11,430
way below the fish because refraction,
like anyone's ever taken a fishing pole

540
00:28:11,431 --> 00:28:12,600
and stuck in the water.
Right,

541
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,850
right.
You see the hooks.

542
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,430
So that's like,
that's like the trick of both fishing.

543
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:20,250
But were they both fish for some of the
stuff?

544
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:24,630
My favorite thing that both fish down
there is also you also dealing with

545
00:28:24,631 --> 00:28:26,730
current and they're,
again,

546
00:28:26,731 --> 00:28:29,400
they're shooting a hollow arrow.
That doesn't weigh shit.

547
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:33,630
It doesn't cut through the water at all.
So they're holding way low for

548
00:28:33,631 --> 00:28:38,631
refraction and holding way upstream
because their Arrow is so buoyant.

549
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:40,620
Oh Wow.
Now,

550
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:41,640
uh,
an American,

551
00:28:41,641 --> 00:28:44,880
both fish and reg,
which I shoot has a fiberglass Arrow,

552
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:50,240
so the current isn't as much of an issue
because that arrows so heavy that it can

553
00:28:50,551 --> 00:28:53,190
cut through the water.
But refraction is the same.

554
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,650
So that's why,
uh,

555
00:28:55,970 --> 00:29:00,510
a point blank shot both phishing is
still very difficult and then you've got

556
00:29:00,511 --> 00:29:02,280
to factor that.
You still need to hit the thing pretty

557
00:29:02,281 --> 00:29:04,560
good in a place where the arrows is not
going to pop out.

558
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:08,430
There's a fish.
They bowhunt hunt for that they used the

559
00:29:08,431 --> 00:29:13,431
bowl hunt for for salted fish called the
era [inaudible] and airplane was the

560
00:29:14,281 --> 00:29:15,660
biggest freshwater fish in the world.

561
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:18,120
They say they're going to.
Sturgeon.

562
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,040
Yeah,
the largest freshwater fish.

563
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:20,970
The largest.
Okay.

564
00:29:20,971 --> 00:29:24,990
The largest scaled.
An [inaudible] is the largest scaled

565
00:29:24,991 --> 00:29:27,030
freshwater fish.
How big is it?

566
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,640
I mean,
they'll get him up into the hundreds of

567
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,190
pounds.
I've never even heard of it.

568
00:29:31,191 --> 00:29:33,060
It looks like it.
It's,

569
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:38,010
it's a r a p A.
I am a.

570
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:39,440
yeah,
that's an Arab hyman.

571
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:42,820
She says,
Christ that looks completely

572
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:45,460
prehistoric.
They have a bizarre relationship with

573
00:29:45,461 --> 00:29:50,461
these fish in the Macusa do in Guyana,
so that's amazing.

574
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:55,540
They used to hunt them looking creditor.
They used to hunt them to export the

575
00:29:55,541 --> 00:29:59,140
salted meat based 100 to sell.
Assaulted me to markets.

576
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:01,750
Okay.
Now,

577
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:06,280
uh,
one of those is worth $7,000 to them

578
00:30:06,281 --> 00:30:07,750
alive.
Holy Shit.

579
00:30:07,751 --> 00:30:09,610
Because that's how much.
That's how much a white guy will pay to

580
00:30:09,611 --> 00:30:10,540
catch one.
And let it go.

581
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:13,090
Oh my God.
Yeah.

582
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:17,470
Oh,
so it's a guy like a guy will pay more

583
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:20,890
to Macusa,
will make more to take a guy out to

584
00:30:20,891 --> 00:30:21,570
catch an error.

585
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:23,860
Piman let it go.
Then what you'd pay to hunt for elk in

586
00:30:23,861 --> 00:30:26,620
the US on a guided trip.
Holy Shit.

587
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:29,400
They get seven grand to catch an error,
paella.

588
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:34,560
And when Rovan was a kid,
they would go on to week hunting trips

589
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,660
where they're gone for two weeks with
their father.

590
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,570
They would go for two weeks to hunt salt
fish.

591
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,810
So they were.
They were operating at a dug out canoes

592
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:49,930
that they would have to paddle and they
would paddle a duck that would make a

593
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:52,570
dug out canoe themselves,
paddle the Dugout,

594
00:30:52,571 --> 00:30:56,500
can you up river for a week to get to
the good hunting and fishing grounds.

595
00:30:56,860 --> 00:31:01,860
Then they would hunt and fish for one
week until they would get 100 pounds of

596
00:31:02,891 --> 00:31:06,910
salted fish.
Then you'd go back down river,

597
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:11,940
which would take a day or two days and
then get to the mouth of the Rupa Nuni

598
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:17,340
River and paddle up the Reuben Nuni
river for two days to another town and

599
00:31:18,311 --> 00:31:23,311
then they would haul the salt fish,
including era of flesh and sell that 100

600
00:31:25,241 --> 00:31:28,180
pounds of salted fish for 75 US dollars.

601
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:34,540
So two weeks plus work for a family for
$75.

602
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:39,870
And now they will not touch those fish
because they make a handful of people

603
00:31:40,271 --> 00:31:42,940
every year go down and give them seven
grand to catch one,

604
00:31:42,941 --> 00:31:46,200
let it go.
So seven grand to them must be just an

605
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,620
enormous.
It's changed everything.

606
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,530
When I was talking about like that,
they discovered sunglasses and shit.

607
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:53,560
There's been a lot like they were
already onto this air pilot thing.

608
00:31:53,561 --> 00:31:56,500
The first thing I went down and it's,
it's changed everything about it.

609
00:31:56,501 --> 00:31:59,440
It's changed that village,
the air pilot fishery,

610
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:02,350
the way they used the arrows on them out
of trees,

611
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:04,720
they would.
So you're familiar like when,

612
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:07,510
when a river,
a river flows in asp pattern,

613
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:10,090
like repeating s's now.
And then,

614
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:11,740
um,
during high water,

615
00:32:11,741 --> 00:32:16,741
a river will jump one of the assets.
You've picked it up saying yes.

616
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:21,430
So the river jumps and ass in it,
abandoned in the main channel abandons

617
00:32:21,431 --> 00:32:23,950
the curves of the S.
okay.

618
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:29,070
Those curves become what's called oxbow
lakes were during high water during a

619
00:32:29,381 --> 00:32:31,570
flood.
Those oxbow lakes are connected to the

620
00:32:31,571 --> 00:32:33,820
main river system.
When the water goes low,

621
00:32:33,821 --> 00:32:38,821
the oxbow lakes become a isolated air
pimas living those oxbow lakes and they

622
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:44,230
on peacock bass and other stuff.
So when the water got low and the era

623
00:32:44,691 --> 00:32:47,660
pimas,
we're all kind of restricted to very

624
00:32:47,661 --> 00:32:52,661
small little spots in the river.
They would climb up in trees overlooking

625
00:32:54,741 --> 00:32:59,570
these places and wait for the air pilot
to come up near the surface and shoot it

626
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:03,200
with an arrow.
There was a detachable,

627
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:06,290
basically Harpoon head Arrow and shoot
it with the Arrow.

628
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:10,220
The Harpoon had,
would detach from the Arrow and the

629
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:13,970
Arrow would float on the surface
connected by string to the Arrow shaft.

630
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:18,680
You would then go take a hand line with
a hook and file that fish in your

631
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:23,000
dugout,
canoe until you could cast your hook out

632
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:28,060
and catch your Arrow and then you're
connected by your fishing line to your

633
00:33:29,421 --> 00:33:34,421
Arrow and your arrows connected by the
tether to the Harpoon head and you would

634
00:33:35,121 --> 00:33:39,230
hand line in and slaughter the Arab Ima,
Jesus,

635
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,510
and then drive the era.

636
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:45,050
Pama was salt and they and they still
have salt fish day,

637
00:33:45,051 --> 00:33:47,240
like when we're out fishing,
they're salt and fish all the time.

638
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:51,970
They would salt that fish and then sell
it and then that became an endangered

639
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:56,340
like that became like a,
a very threatened species under the

640
00:33:56,341 --> 00:33:58,970
thing and the I thing that they would
hunt for is would hunt for giant river

641
00:33:58,971 --> 00:34:03,971
turtles and sell the meat and I'm
greatly depleted because their whole

642
00:34:04,341 --> 00:34:08,660
lives occur on this one river in.
Once those market influences came in and

643
00:34:08,661 --> 00:34:13,430
they had moved beyond subsistence
hunting and fishing and they moved into

644
00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:16,700
market hunting and fishing.
They did the same thing that we did to

645
00:34:16,701 --> 00:34:19,790
our own country in the late 18 hundreds,
early 19 hundreds is eight.

646
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:24,791
We're on course to entirely deplete the
resource through market demands because

647
00:34:26,601 --> 00:34:28,400
their village gets more and more people
all time.

648
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:34,420
It grew considerably in the five or six
years between my two visits and their

649
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,850
environment just couldn't support that
level of market hunting.

650
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:43,240
So this era pimas thing,
chi is giving gives them a way to make

651
00:34:46,941 --> 00:34:49,970
money to,
to buy staples and run a school and

652
00:34:49,971 --> 00:34:51,620
stuff like that.
It gives them kind of an out.

653
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:54,260
And it's funny because like a,

654
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:59,400
I'm a lot more interested.
Like personally I'm a lot more

655
00:34:59,401 --> 00:35:04,200
interested in a guy shooting fish,
arbitrary and salt in the meat than I am

656
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,620
a dude like me going down to catch an
error [inaudible] and let it go.

657
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,770
So in some ways it's sad.
Yeah,

658
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,410
it's sad just because like
it's not sad.

659
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:15,960
It's great that they're saving the
fishery,

660
00:35:15,961 --> 00:35:19,040
but you see like just,
it's just sad to see shit changed man.

661
00:35:19,041 --> 00:35:21,930
And why do they let it go?
Why don't they give it to the people

662
00:35:21,931 --> 00:35:23,760
that live there so they could use it for
the meat.

663
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:26,760
They let it go so they can catch it
again because they want to make sure

664
00:35:26,761 --> 00:35:29,880
that the population stays laughing.
So Robin,

665
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:30,721
what,
here's the thing,

666
00:35:30,721 --> 00:35:32,520
the reason that one of those oxbow
lakes,

667
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:36,630
uh,
got lower and lower and lower and

668
00:35:36,631 --> 00:35:37,830
someone,
one of their guys,

669
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:41,920
one of these Macusa guys realize there's
26 era piman stranded,

670
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:45,540
an oxbow lake and the pimas are running
out of water and when the water goes

671
00:35:45,541 --> 00:35:47,460
down,
the air pine will excavate.

672
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:51,660
He'll keep excavating in the bottom to
even just save a little spot for

673
00:35:51,661 --> 00:35:53,360
himself.
Okay?

674
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:56,010
And a guy found them in.
They're all in there,

675
00:35:56,011 --> 00:35:57,960
but there's not enough water to,
to cover them up.

676
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:00,160
They can sip air is the thing that makes
them cooler.

677
00:36:00,161 --> 00:36:03,750
So you can always find era [inaudible]
because they come up the gold bear,

678
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:08,220
Jesus,
the role air and very loud noise they

679
00:36:08,221 --> 00:36:12,150
make when they come up to gold bear.
So they can live in low oxygen

680
00:36:12,151 --> 00:36:15,030
environments.
Like if you took most fish and threw

681
00:36:15,031 --> 00:36:17,850
them in a stagnant oxbow that's got six
inches of water in it,

682
00:36:17,851 --> 00:36:19,040
I mean they're dead.
His Shit right?

683
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:22,500
Is there a pimas they can just keep
excavating a little spot in the bottom

684
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:27,000
and just wait,
praying or their equivalent of praying

685
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:31,350
that the water level comes back up and
liberate them from the oxbow?

686
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:32,770
There still needs a huge fish.
Yeah,

687
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:36,000
giants.
So they found 26 that were out of the

688
00:36:36,001 --> 00:36:40,450
water in their backs were all messed up
from birds and other predators grab in

689
00:36:40,451 --> 00:36:45,451
the air trying to grab the era pimas and
then they went and spent four days.

690
00:36:45,811 --> 00:36:50,811
These are 26 air time is between 50
inches in upper eighties in length.

691
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:56,960
They spent four days moving these 26
Arab pimas into the river in a canoe

692
00:37:00,271 --> 00:37:02,640
full of water.
Jesus Christ.

693
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,740
That's all valuable.
Those fish are to him now.

694
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:06,630
In the old days it had been dead.
His Shit.

695
00:37:06,631 --> 00:37:08,530
Right?
Like you just sold them.

696
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:11,010
Yeah.
So they just like a fine night.

697
00:37:11,011 --> 00:37:14,190
They have like on the river,
the river that they call home the river,

698
00:37:14,191 --> 00:37:16,830
they kind of control.
There's like a finite resource.

699
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:21,150
But the thing is other groups,
so they're mostly [inaudible].

700
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:24,540
And my friend Roman's Macusa.
Um,

701
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:26,940
his wife is Wapa Shauna.

702
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:32,450
And there are other Wapa Shauna's and
other places who will come down to hunt

703
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:37,680
their area and they have very different
like these other groups that come in

704
00:37:37,681 --> 00:37:41,340
have different hunting practices.
Like Robin was telling me one time that

705
00:37:41,341 --> 00:37:43,820
he was going up.
So the largest snake in the worlds of

706
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:48,180
Green Anaconda,
their river has the largest thing in the

707
00:37:48,181 --> 00:37:50,070
alligator family,
which is the black Caiman.

708
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:50,911
Some people say,
oh,

709
00:37:50,911 --> 00:37:53,430
it's not a true alligator,
but the largest member of that.

710
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:56,130
How big is Emilia?
Black Caiman.

711
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:57,420
Yeah.
They get big.

712
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,910
They get bigger,
like American alligator big like yeah,

713
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,920
they get giants.
Some black came and stayed.

714
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:07,410
There used to be a market for those.
They use the market hunt those for the

715
00:38:07,411 --> 00:38:09,780
heights for bags,
boots and shit.

716
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:14,030
So they have the giant River Otter,
which is a river out or like way to go

717
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:16,500
up river otters go to 100 pounds.

718
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:19,650
They had the biggest snake,
the Green Anaconda.

719
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:22,020
They had the largest aquatic roden in
the world,

720
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:26,130
the largest freshwater scaled fish by
some definitions.

721
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,530
The largest eagle,
which is the Harpy Eagle.

722
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:30,990
The Philippine Eagle has a bigger wing
span,

723
00:38:30,991 --> 00:38:32,700
but some like when you measured by
weight,

724
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:38,550
the Harpy from and then there's another
harpy that's a giant,

725
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,470
like the Papillon,
the Papa New Guinea heartbeat.

726
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:44,440
The heartbeat is that one that eats
sloths and monkeys.

727
00:38:44,441 --> 00:38:45,430
Monkeys and shit.
Yeah.

728
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:48,670
Was amongst some bad.
We saw one really.

729
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:51,610
So I'd been down in Harpy country three
times.

730
00:38:51,611 --> 00:38:53,410
I finally saw my first heartbeat.
Wow.

731
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,140
Yeah.
Just like suggestic,

732
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:59,830
just piercing,
kind of unforgettable.

733
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:04,930
I'm just the face on it to the male,
the male face.

734
00:39:04,931 --> 00:39:06,760
You're looking at it.
It just is like a.

735
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:11,500
So it remind me the first time I saw
links or are you just looking at it and

736
00:39:11,501 --> 00:39:15,040
it just.
So freakishly different than anything

737
00:39:15,041 --> 00:39:18,070
you'd looked at like that harpies face.
So they had that.

738
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,713
Um.

739
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:22,870
Oh.
So he's going up the river.

740
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:24,550
He's telling me this story,
how the whopper,

741
00:39:24,551 --> 00:39:27,600
Shawna will come down and hunting and
hunting different than the Macusa.

742
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:30,430
Like the Macoun aren't that big on
killing Tay peers.

743
00:39:30,431 --> 00:39:33,670
But the WAPA Shawna will come down in
their area and he says they come down

744
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:36,790
with arrows and got 12 inch steel tips
on him and he's like,

745
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:40,120
you know,
those boys are Hunton tape tapirs.

746
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:44,920
But he said one time he was going up
river and he sees a Green Anaconda and

747
00:39:44,921 --> 00:39:49,921
he goes to look in.
It's got a arrowhead stuck into it and

748
00:39:50,021 --> 00:39:52,120
he said,
and I told my companion,

749
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:53,560
the whopper,
Sean are here,

750
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:57,700
and they go up the river low mit.
Of course they come to a whopper,

751
00:39:57,701 --> 00:39:59,520
shawn at Camp [inaudible].
The walk was shot.

752
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:03,300
He said he's like talking about this
particular watershed as a lawyer,

753
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:07,810
but he's like this particular group of
Wapa Sean is it travel ahead of

754
00:40:07,811 --> 00:40:08,644
Christmas?

755
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:10,450
Because he's there.
They're like,

756
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:15,200
they have animist,
you know,

757
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,140
mystical systems.
But they also.

758
00:40:17,141 --> 00:40:19,600
It's also infused with a certain level
of Christianity.

759
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:24,670
So ahead of Christmas,
the Wapa Sean and will go on a couple

760
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:29,670
month long hunting trip to get food for
Christmas celebrations and they'll

761
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:34,510
travel overland and by river to come
down and hunt them Macusa river.

762
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:37,370
And when they come down,
they're there.

763
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:40,510
They're playing for keeps,
so they come down there hunting Arab.

764
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,830
Hi Emma.
Which these,

765
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:45,430
which the Rebbe Macusa do not,
uh,

766
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,520
they're hunting anacondas.
They own everything.

767
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:49,840
They eat the Anaconda.
Yeah.

768
00:40:49,841 --> 00:40:53,410
They dry all that shit and the fat,
they like to render the fat down because

769
00:40:53,411 --> 00:40:55,510
they feel that it is helpful for,
um,

770
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,730
they feel that it's helpful for
arthritis.

771
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,700
We pulled up on,
uh,

772
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,220
on,
uh,

773
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:05,220
we pulled up on an Anaconda one time
that was 13 or 14 feet long just sitting

774
00:41:06,071 --> 00:41:06,460
on the bank.

775
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:08,080
You can walk up,
you can walk right up to it.

776
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,140
Robin was telling me,
um,

777
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:14,770
again,
a type like mysticism and when we have

778
00:41:14,771 --> 00:41:16,510
our own beliefs that would seem absurd,
right?

779
00:41:16,511 --> 00:41:21,511
To an outside perspective.
But he was telling me if I were to touch

780
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:26,910
that Anaconda with my boat,
it would die a very painful death if I

781
00:41:30,701 --> 00:41:35,701
just laid my bowl him on it.
And about how long he says he thought

782
00:41:36,351 --> 00:41:41,120
about it at about 45 minutes.
Just the belief they have.

783
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:44,480
If you touch it with a hunting bow,
it will die in 45 minutes.

784
00:41:44,481 --> 00:41:46,610
But it's painful.
How bizarre.

785
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:50,570
No experts,
I asked about that a thousand times and

786
00:41:50,571 --> 00:41:52,090
never got any more clarity on it.
Net.

787
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,140
I say,
can you touch it with a stick?

788
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:55,490
It doesn't matter.
Go ahead.

789
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:59,960
Touch it with a bolt will die.
So.

790
00:41:59,961 --> 00:42:00,621
But yeah,
they don't eat it,

791
00:42:00,621 --> 00:42:04,100
but he was telling me if you're really
hard up and have really bad arthritis,

792
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:06,980
you can take the fat from Anaconda and
help cure the arthritis.

793
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:08,660
How much fat is an Anaconda?
I don't know.

794
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:10,280
I never.
I never cut into one.

795
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:13,640
I've seen a rattlesnake skinned.
They seem like they don't have any fat.

796
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,860
You gotta understand how big these
things are though.

797
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,530
They're so big.
I mean way bigger than your leg.

798
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,720
Yeah.
Was 14 feet long.

799
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:23,330
Fourteen feet long was probably weighs
hundreds of pounds,

800
00:42:23,331 --> 00:42:24,164
right?
Oh yeah.

801
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,960
No,
hundreds of pounds if you eaten

802
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:26,930
rattlesnake.
Yeah,

803
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:28,040
it's not bad,
right?

804
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:30,530
It's not really.
Says that sucker.

805
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:31,641
Yeah,
there's,

806
00:42:31,641 --> 00:42:33,200
there's a good one.
Jesus.

807
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,630
Yeah,
that's a heavy fucker.

808
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:38,300
Yeah,
those guys struggling for dudes

809
00:42:38,301 --> 00:42:39,290
struggling.
Oh,

810
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:40,230
that's out a guy on.

811
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:43,850
Did you ever see that movie with
Jennifer Lopez?

812
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:46,070
Nope.
Anaconda.

813
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:48,040
So giant one like.
Yeah.

814
00:42:48,041 --> 00:42:50,120
So that's the biggest snake.
And uh,

815
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:53,600
they'll eat cayman's anacondas well,
yeah.

816
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:56,300
Yeah.
And it came as lead them when they're

817
00:42:56,301 --> 00:42:57,134
younger.
Yeah.

818
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:59,330
Know it's a vicious amount of everything
you eat and everything.

819
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:02,240
Um,
so these,

820
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:03,730
these gentlemen,
the Macoun,

821
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:08,740
she came down the Wapa shop,
Ashana have different hunting practices

822
00:43:10,461 --> 00:43:14,330
and different things that are acceptable
to eat and they have.

823
00:43:14,331 --> 00:43:19,331
And this is a group of Wapa Shauna.
So the hunting and fishing socks are

824
00:43:19,551 --> 00:43:20,900
going after each other.
No,

825
00:43:20,901 --> 00:43:25,901
that was a different story.
Now it's different pissing match with

826
00:43:26,121 --> 00:43:27,500
someone else.
So,

827
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:32,020
um,
so there was that.

828
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:36,170
They're hunting area sucks that this
group of Wapa Shannon that come down to

829
00:43:36,171 --> 00:43:39,400
rape and pillage on the Rebbe A.
Yeah.

830
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:41,330
Robin,
explain to me their hunting areas of

831
00:43:41,331 --> 00:43:42,200
Piss,
poor hunting area.

832
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:43,280
So why do they stay there?

833
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:45,740
I don't know.
I don't know why they stay there.

834
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:47,440
Hmm.
Um,

835
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:49,160
and I asked him to like,
does it go,

836
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:52,820
does it make you guys mad today?
Come down because now the,

837
00:43:52,850 --> 00:43:57,070
like the people in the predominantly
Macusa reba village,

838
00:43:57,340 --> 00:43:59,870
um,
is onto a,

839
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:03,920
they're on like a pretty progressive
conservation program.

840
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:08,330
Like they can just dig through their
market hunting practices.

841
00:44:08,331 --> 00:44:11,450
They got a glimpse into the future and
didn't like what they saw and they were

842
00:44:11,451 --> 00:44:14,750
on a pretty aggressive program about
sustainability.

843
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:19,370
I'm their eyes toward the future.
The WAPA Shawna are this group of

844
00:44:19,371 --> 00:44:20,770
Robuchon or not.
And when I asked them,

845
00:44:20,771 --> 00:44:23,780
does it piss you off to the whopper?
Shauna come down here and oh,

846
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:26,570
they also the whopper,
Sean offish with poison Macusa.

847
00:44:26,571 --> 00:44:29,600
Don't fish the poison.
Do they use the poison from the cassava?

848
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:32,160
No,
they a poison.

849
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:33,980
They use a,
uh,

850
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:39,170
there's a root and the leaf that are
both poisons the root.

851
00:44:39,830 --> 00:44:42,870
It's an thing use here in the United
States when they have to do a fish kill.

852
00:44:42,871 --> 00:44:47,070
Like if you get a big population of
invasive fish in a waterway and you just

853
00:44:47,071 --> 00:44:50,550
need to like wipe the whole thing,
clean Ed's shit like that when you're

854
00:44:50,551 --> 00:44:53,310
trying to do a fish kill.
We in the US use a thing called

855
00:44:53,330 --> 00:44:55,800
[inaudible] and it's derived from a
South American plant.

856
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:57,830
And then there's another plant called
Barbato.

857
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:58,561
Well,
some people,

858
00:44:58,561 --> 00:44:59,101
some,
you know,

859
00:44:59,101 --> 00:45:01,080
it's like different people in different
areas.

860
00:45:01,081 --> 00:45:03,780
And the Amazon drainage as a thing they
call Barb Bosco,

861
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:08,920
and that is a leaf that you just pull up
and it would look like you're just like

862
00:45:08,950 --> 00:45:10,920
taken.
If you just imagine if you took a bunch

863
00:45:10,921 --> 00:45:14,850
of time or rosemary and put it in a
mortar and pestle and pulped it,

864
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,460
and then you take and spread that in the
water.

865
00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:19,200
That'll kill fish.

866
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,030
Both of,
I think they kind of,

867
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:23,850
they act in two separate ways.
There's two types of fish,

868
00:45:23,851 --> 00:45:28,470
poise and one inhibits the fishes
ability to pull oxygen from the water.

869
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:32,880
So I watched them apply this poison and
you need to get area.

870
00:45:32,881 --> 00:45:35,780
There's not much current because it'll
just wash the poison away.

871
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:37,770
So you get into one of these oxbow
lakes,

872
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:43,250
apply the poison kickback 20 minutes and
pretty soon all the Fisher up gulping at

873
00:45:43,381 --> 00:45:46,290
the surface and then you shoot them with
bows and arrows.

874
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:48,000
Wow.
Um,

875
00:45:48,030 --> 00:45:49,770
what's the other way of doing it?
And wrote none.

876
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:52,350
And I can't remember which category
wrote downfalls and,

877
00:45:52,351 --> 00:45:55,980
but there's another one that has some
kind of like some kind of neuro effect

878
00:45:55,981 --> 00:46:00,240
that it has some kind of brain in
somehow impairs some other aspect of

879
00:46:00,241 --> 00:46:03,060
their body.
But these fish poisons are classed in

880
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:03,810
two categories.

881
00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:05,700
I'm sorry,
I'm not more clear on what the two are,

882
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:09,780
but I know that the ones that just
prevent it from be able to get air and

883
00:46:09,781 --> 00:46:12,810
the other one keeps the police in them.
The ones that don't suffocate them,

884
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:15,780
does that come up when they eat it?
No,

885
00:46:15,781 --> 00:46:18,180
but they were telling me that,
that um,

886
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:22,770
if you need to watch your,
if you're poisoning a pond,

887
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:28,410
you need to watch it and make sure dogs
or any livestock don't come down.

888
00:46:28,411 --> 00:46:31,890
It doesn't last long.
And they were telling me usually the

889
00:46:31,891 --> 00:46:36,840
fish you don't shoot will recover if
there's some amount of water flowing

890
00:46:36,841 --> 00:46:39,000
through it.
So they might go in and build a

891
00:46:39,001 --> 00:46:43,440
temporary dam to block whatever inlet.
Let's just say it's a,

892
00:46:43,441 --> 00:46:46,320
it's a isolated channel off to the side
of river.

893
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:49,530
They'll go in and pretty carefully with
rocks and logs,

894
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:51,840
block the flow,
coming into it,

895
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:54,420
poison it,
and then once they've gotten whatever

896
00:46:54,421 --> 00:46:57,510
they want,
they unblock it and let the clean water

897
00:46:57,511 --> 00:46:59,880
come in and they'll resuscitate the
fish.

898
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:01,560
Whoa.
But yeah,

899
00:47:01,590 --> 00:47:04,710
if,
if they said of livestock dogs,

900
00:47:04,770 --> 00:47:07,410
people drink that water can kill that.
It can kill that company.

901
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:10,200
Do they lose people?
Every unit that Kusamba water man and

902
00:47:10,201 --> 00:47:12,030
talking to me,
you realize they lose this like a

903
00:47:12,031 --> 00:47:13,920
handful of things that people get lost
too.

904
00:47:14,650 --> 00:47:16,790
Um,
they had mentioned people dying from

905
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,300
anacondas.
They'd mentioned people dying from Black

906
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:21,400
Cayman's.
Um,

907
00:47:21,570 --> 00:47:26,570
I know that injuries from puranas are
common snake bite.

908
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:30,430
The snakes are everywhere.
Like in one of these,

909
00:47:30,431 --> 00:47:32,650
I remember sitting in Robin's friend's
house,

910
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:34,960
his outdoor,
like a Palapa kind of house,

911
00:47:34,961 --> 00:47:36,810
you know,
with hammock strung in it and they're

912
00:47:36,811 --> 00:47:40,150
just being a giant tranche.
Low like a two and a half inch diameter

913
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:43,750
transla.
And I'm not even doing anything to it.

914
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:46,540
Which randall is,
they just hurt.

915
00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:47,350
Yeah,
they hurt.

916
00:47:47,350 --> 00:47:50,350
They don't really fuck you up like a
black widow or something along those

917
00:47:50,351 --> 00:47:54,860
lines before we found a kid who had been
hit by a scorpion young kid and um,

918
00:47:54,910 --> 00:47:56,290
some scorpions can be fatal.

919
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:58,180
He was vomiting,
he was very sick,

920
00:47:58,570 --> 00:48:01,990
but just the fact of life.
So when they get bit by snakes,

921
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:04,570
they getting bit by poisonous snakes.
Yeah.

922
00:48:04,571 --> 00:48:06,460
There's one,
I think the most debt,

923
00:48:06,461 --> 00:48:08,560
the deadliest snake in the western
hemisphere,

924
00:48:08,561 --> 00:48:10,160
the coral they have.
Yeah.

925
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:14,420
They have all the ones he mentioned,
their chief getting hit by a,

926
00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:18,430
by a venomous snake and them having to
call a medevac which is not in the air

927
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:21,910
for I think the air force came in with a
helicopter and got them out of there and

928
00:48:21,911 --> 00:48:24,280
he was fine.
Wow.

929
00:48:24,490 --> 00:48:26,680
Just the fact that law,
that shit's everywhere man,

930
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:30,400
but they got an eye for it and you don't
like,

931
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:32,620
like you're like,
you guys,

932
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:34,600
you know the,
the non locals eyes,

933
00:48:34,601 --> 00:48:37,210
the one getting stung and bit and shit.
Yeah.

934
00:48:37,211 --> 00:48:40,090
I can only imagine like the first time I
was down there I got hit by an electric

935
00:48:40,091 --> 00:48:41,110
eel a couple times.

936
00:48:41,110 --> 00:48:42,760
Right.
That scared the shit out of me,

937
00:48:42,761 --> 00:48:44,530
but it's like you don't even know what's
happening.

938
00:48:44,531 --> 00:48:47,020
You're in the water and Austin,
you're kind of getting electrocuted.

939
00:48:47,290 --> 00:48:49,210
There was more in tune with all that
stuff.

940
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:51,500
That's a strong blast.
Yeah,

941
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:54,400
it hurts.
We have those on fear factor or grab

942
00:48:54,401 --> 00:48:55,720
them.
It's like grab a barbell.

943
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:59,230
It's like grabbing a hot wire.
It's amazing that an animal,

944
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:01,000
a living thing and generate that kind
of.

945
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:04,900
Did it voluntarily for a joke just to
see what it's like.

946
00:49:04,990 --> 00:49:06,070
Yeah.
It's not fun.

947
00:49:06,130 --> 00:49:07,690
No,
I was shocked.

948
00:49:07,870 --> 00:49:10,090
That sounds like it's probably just
annoying.

949
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:11,770
But I reached in and grabbed it.
I was like,

950
00:49:11,771 --> 00:49:12,670
whoa.
Yeah,

951
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:14,860
that's legit.
And it's like,

952
00:49:14,861 --> 00:49:18,370
it's like grabbing a,
a hot wire fence with cattle in it.

953
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:19,481
Yeah.
I watched,

954
00:49:19,481 --> 00:49:21,100
um,
there was some sort of a nature

955
00:49:21,101 --> 00:49:24,670
documentary where something tried to eat
it and uh,

956
00:49:24,671 --> 00:49:29,020
the electrical eel zapped it and you see
this animal just lock up and fall over

957
00:49:29,021 --> 00:49:29,640
sideways.

958
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:30,350
Oh really?
Yeah,

959
00:49:30,350 --> 00:49:31,230
just pedaled.
Yeah,

960
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:35,060
just,
just completely electrocuted it got it

961
00:49:35,070 --> 00:49:37,450
to the point where it just couldn't
stand up.

962
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:40,000
Have you.
I know you'd like a.

963
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:44,020
you'll pull up some stuff.
Have you seen the video of the Jaguar

964
00:49:44,021 --> 00:49:45,460
killing the Cayman?
Yes,

965
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:47,360
I've seen a bunch of fat solid shit.
Right,

966
00:49:48,090 --> 00:49:49,150
because you just.
Since he's done that,

967
00:49:49,151 --> 00:49:50,800
a thousand dollars.
There's A.

968
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:53,600
There's quite a few of them online.
And here's what's.

969
00:49:53,601 --> 00:49:56,710
What's fascinating.
What does this cayman with electric eel

970
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:58,030
and alligator and electric eels.
Oh,

971
00:49:58,031 --> 00:50:00,130
wow.
Frying.

972
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:01,210
Yeah,
it's just cooking.

973
00:50:01,670 --> 00:50:02,890
Oh Wow.
No,

974
00:50:02,891 --> 00:50:03,371
that's the.
Oh,

975
00:50:03,371 --> 00:50:05,950
you asked about eating snakes.
Electric eel meat is not good.

976
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:10,420
That's one of the many things that the.
That's one of the many things that

977
00:50:10,421 --> 00:50:12,520
Macusa like do not eat.
Look at his body.

978
00:50:12,521 --> 00:50:14,320
Just twitching.
God,

979
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:17,140
that's amazing.
And obviously that's a little alligator,

980
00:50:17,650 --> 00:50:18,483
but still.

981
00:50:18,970 --> 00:50:21,460
Boy,
what a crazy animal.

982
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:22,813
Yeah.
Was brutal.

983
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:27,560
I never saw anything about Jaguars
killing Cayman's until about three or

984
00:50:27,561 --> 00:50:29,540
four years ago.
And then there's like a whole slew of

985
00:50:29,541 --> 00:50:31,970
these videos coming out.
It makes you wonder,

986
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:35,590
I guess maybe the advent of Gopros and
all these different video cameras.

987
00:50:35,610 --> 00:50:38,420
People take down there and finally
started catching it on film.

988
00:50:38,570 --> 00:50:40,370
Yup.
We missed the cycling bike.

989
00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:42,850
We miss the sighting,
narrowly missed the siding.

990
00:50:42,851 --> 00:50:44,510
We were down there,
tracks are everywhere,

991
00:50:44,930 --> 00:50:47,180
so particularly because the time was
just down there.

992
00:50:47,181 --> 00:50:52,181
Now the giant river turtles are nesting,
so they just like how we have,

993
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:56,390
you know,
just how you picked your sea turtles,

994
00:50:56,391 --> 00:50:59,930
crawl up onto a sandy beach and dig a
hole that night later eggs and then

995
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:04,010
retreat back into the ocean.
Giant river turtles lay like that.

996
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:09,460
But so the sandbars are covered in
Boston turtle shells and there are

997
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:12,590
vultures.

998
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:17,600
So like black vultures and king vultures
and Cara Cara's around the sandbars

999
00:51:17,601 --> 00:51:22,601
feeding on turtle eggs and Jaguar tracks
all over because the jaguars come down

1000
00:51:25,161 --> 00:51:27,800
to wait for the turtles to come up.
Wow.

1001
00:51:28,370 --> 00:51:30,950
So you've seen a lot of that and one of
the more surreal,

1002
00:51:32,150 --> 00:51:33,480
that's a perspective shot,
but,

1003
00:51:33,570 --> 00:51:34,670
but they're pretty big,
right?

1004
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:35,391
Big with.
That's,

1005
00:51:35,391 --> 00:51:37,460
that's the oceanic.
That's not a judgment to look at that

1006
00:51:37,461 --> 00:51:41,660
sucker.
So how old is that fucker?

1007
00:51:41,870 --> 00:51:43,250
But I have no idea.
God does.

1008
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:45,020
They live hundreds of years,
right?

1009
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:45,620
Yeah,
they're,

1010
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:47,960
they're ancient thing.
Might've been around when Columbus was

1011
00:51:47,961 --> 00:51:49,290
around the,
you know,

1012
00:51:49,390 --> 00:51:50,380
the,
the.

1013
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:52,010
Are you familiar with the [inaudible]
treaty?

1014
00:51:52,011 --> 00:51:54,020
So,
uh,

1015
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:56,150
things that band international wildlife
traffic,

1016
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:58,230
they have.
There's a couple of turtles at the

1017
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:01,850
MACUSA eat 'em.
They traditionally eight giant river

1018
00:52:01,851 --> 00:52:05,250
turtles and many people still do,
but they call that one the site.

1019
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:06,860
He's turtle.
Oh Wow.

1020
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:09,620
Because they now know they can't traffic
and there's certainly more so they got

1021
00:52:09,621 --> 00:52:14,540
like the eating turtle and the turtle.
But an image it will be forever burned

1022
00:52:14,541 --> 00:52:19,190
in my mind.
There's two things that this to like

1023
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:21,830
sites that'll ever forever be stuck in
my mind.

1024
00:52:21,831 --> 00:52:23,970
And one of them is a,
a Wapa,

1025
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:27,180
a woman
in a Dka,

1026
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:32,460
Dka n y t shirt
up to her armpit and a riverbank digging

1027
00:52:33,351 --> 00:52:35,690
out.
One hundred and 50 turtle eggs.

1028
00:52:35,810 --> 00:52:40,810
Giant river turtle turtle eggs,
putting them in a handmade woven basket.

1029
00:52:41,930 --> 00:52:43,880
Wow.
Because you know,

1030
00:52:43,881 --> 00:52:47,000
like Khloe,
like donated clothes,

1031
00:52:47,001 --> 00:52:49,910
like cast off,
close wind up,

1032
00:52:50,990 --> 00:52:52,610
you know,
getting bundled.

1033
00:52:52,910 --> 00:52:57,290
So you see people with like crazy
American tee shirts and stuff on where

1034
00:52:57,291 --> 00:52:59,900
like I have like a Bob's pizza,
Santa Cruz,

1035
00:52:59,901 --> 00:53:01,160
California or whatever,
you know,

1036
00:53:01,161 --> 00:53:03,260
and it's just like something sent down
there through goodwill,

1037
00:53:03,261 --> 00:53:04,520
donation centers,
whatever.

1038
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:08,450
So they'll have like um,
like brands,

1039
00:53:08,451 --> 00:53:09,560
you know,
like,

1040
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:12,620
like famous brands that you see like
people,

1041
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:13,380
you know,
in our,

1042
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:16,340
in our culture wearing,
but there'll be like hunting monkeys in

1043
00:53:16,341 --> 00:53:19,730
them
and like the laggers thing,

1044
00:53:19,731 --> 00:53:21,470
it creates that kind of tension,
you know.

1045
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:25,980
So do they recognize the city's like
regulations?

1046
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:28,260
Do they,
did they not eat those turtles?

1047
00:53:28,290 --> 00:53:29,123
Yeah.
So

1048
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:33,840
you gathered is kind of loose.
They don't traffic in them but they will

1049
00:53:33,841 --> 00:53:35,040
eat them,
but they will eat them.

1050
00:53:35,610 --> 00:53:36,100
Yeah.

1051
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:39,340
So they will collect the eggs but they
won't kill the turtles to sell.

1052
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:41,650
So as they become more aware of
conservation,

1053
00:53:41,651 --> 00:53:43,630
like with this giant fish was the fish
again,

1054
00:53:44,110 --> 00:53:48,100
the Arrow piman as they become more
aware of conservation to do.

1055
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:50,500
Do you see them,
like recognizing like,

1056
00:53:50,501 --> 00:53:52,000
hey,
there's some stuff that we have to leave

1057
00:53:52,001 --> 00:53:53,380
alone.
We got to let it recover.

1058
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:54,081
I mean,
they,

1059
00:53:54,081 --> 00:53:56,860
they obviously,
they're aware of the cycle of life when

1060
00:53:56,861 --> 00:54:00,220
it comes to their slash and burn
agriculture and leaving spots alone,

1061
00:54:00,221 --> 00:54:04,510
like are they becoming more aware of
like what animals they've kind of pushed

1062
00:54:04,511 --> 00:54:06,310
to the brink of extinction.
Yeah.

1063
00:54:06,311 --> 00:54:07,680
And it's like I don't even know how,

1064
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:10,490
which is coming from the younger
generation because talking to guys,

1065
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:15,340
to our new guy who's I'm 43,
this guy just a couple of years older

1066
00:54:15,341 --> 00:54:17,350
than I am and talking to him.
Um,

1067
00:54:18,110 --> 00:54:23,110
and he was a market hunter.
He's glad to see what's happened because

1068
00:54:23,511 --> 00:54:28,511
he in his own lifetime saw how much they
had depleted everything.

1069
00:54:29,750 --> 00:54:33,260
So he and his lifetime salt,
like from market hunting,

1070
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:36,560
not just from subsistence stuff,
but as that village because the village

1071
00:54:36,561 --> 00:54:39,650
was a handful of families right then and
now it's 305 people.

1072
00:54:40,190 --> 00:54:43,100
As that village grew,
he watched,

1073
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:45,680
um,
the giant river otters.

1074
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:50,950
They were hunting giant river otters to
sell the hides into Brazil and they

1075
00:54:51,531 --> 00:54:55,410
would smoke them out of their dens.
So he watched their numbers go down as a

1076
00:54:55,430 --> 00:54:56,960
100 pound otter.
Yeah.

1077
00:54:57,170 --> 00:54:59,000
Wow.
For convenience.

1078
00:54:59,030 --> 00:55:01,130
Just as the name would let you know,
and very vocal,

1079
00:55:02,030 --> 00:55:05,780
a large vocabulary of crazy sounds.
The giant river otters make they get

1080
00:55:05,810 --> 00:55:07,610
when they see you,
they're pissed and they start making

1081
00:55:07,611 --> 00:55:08,690
crazy noises.
See them.

1082
00:55:08,750 --> 00:55:09,710
Oh yeah.
You see them all the time.

1083
00:55:09,711 --> 00:55:10,940
They're squawking at you.
Like,

1084
00:55:10,941 --> 00:55:12,890
what does it sound like?
It's like a

1085
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:14,393
like,

1086
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,160
wow.
But a lot better now.

1087
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:17,290
Look at that soccer.
Oh,

1088
00:55:17,350 --> 00:55:19,800
they're easy.
And some kind of snake or eel.

1089
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:21,450
Wow.
Yeah.

1090
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:23,400
They make,
they have an alarm noise in a number of

1091
00:55:23,401 --> 00:55:26,040
barks and crazy sounds.
Uh,

1092
00:55:26,070 --> 00:55:28,320
so he watched those get depleted from
Hyde hunting,

1093
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:34,430
giant river turtles from hunting eggs.
He said he could see that the era pimas

1094
00:55:34,590 --> 00:55:39,590
were disappearing.
And so he was really glad this guy was

1095
00:55:39,991 --> 00:55:43,440
really glad that they'd gotten onto some
other way to bring some cash into the

1096
00:55:43,441 --> 00:55:45,060
village.
Wow.

1097
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:48,150
And the air uptime of fishing,
how do they find out about this?

1098
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:50,600
Like people from the United States are
like,

1099
00:55:50,670 --> 00:55:51,780
where are they coming from?
You know,

1100
00:55:51,781 --> 00:55:52,614
I'm not sure.

1101
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:54,740
You know,
I know that there's been a number of

1102
00:55:54,741 --> 00:55:56,070
companies,
um,

1103
00:55:56,690 --> 00:56:01,690
coasta sunglasses,
company Kosta invested pretty heavily

1104
00:56:02,330 --> 00:56:05,930
through a conservation program.
They have coasta sunglasses invested

1105
00:56:05,931 --> 00:56:10,931
pretty heavily in helping them establish
a guiding system down there to take

1106
00:56:12,831 --> 00:56:16,070
people out to fish Arab.
So these people that come down,

1107
00:56:16,130 --> 00:56:19,160
trained some of the Macugen how does
deal with Westerners,

1108
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:21,470
like for instance,
um,

1109
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:24,670
in the time and we were out,
we were out.

1110
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:29,140
When I'm with them on the river,
we're out.

1111
00:56:29,890 --> 00:56:34,890
I'm with them
participating in the hunting and fishing

1112
00:56:35,441 --> 00:56:39,340
activities that they do year round on
the things that they identify to be

1113
00:56:39,341 --> 00:56:42,100
sustainable resources because they
still,

1114
00:56:42,130 --> 00:56:44,920
like,
they still hunt several days a week,

1115
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:49,990
right?
Rovan that they live off fishing game.

1116
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:53,290
Everyone in that village,
all their protein is hunting and fishing

1117
00:56:53,291 --> 00:56:55,030
protein and some chickens that they
raise,

1118
00:56:56,140 --> 00:56:57,640
but that's all their protein.

1119
00:56:57,910 --> 00:56:59,980
So they're engaged in,
in a daily sense.

1120
00:56:59,981 --> 00:57:02,830
Like Robin says,
he spends about two days a week farming.

1121
00:57:03,490 --> 00:57:06,250
He spent two or three days a week
hunting and fishing.

1122
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:09,280
And then he has other obligations yet is
to take care of,

1123
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:12,760
but he hunts and fishes constantly year
round and it's just,

1124
00:57:12,850 --> 00:57:16,000
if he kills a white lip packery he says,
that's good for a week.

1125
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:17,590
Did you bring your bow?
Yeah,

1126
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:20,170
I brought my bowl fish and boat and I
brought a regular bowl.

1127
00:57:20,290 --> 00:57:22,030
Now when they saw your bow,
where they're like,

1128
00:57:22,090 --> 00:57:23,560
Jesus,
can you get us some of these,

1129
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:26,320
you know,
surprisingly not that excited about it

1130
00:57:26,321 --> 00:57:28,090
because they,
I think that they know they would run up

1131
00:57:28,091 --> 00:57:31,420
against sourcing problems with the
arrowverse got a,

1132
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:33,670
at one point in time,
robin had a recurve,

1133
00:57:34,510 --> 00:57:36,790
um,
but he lost his house burnt down and he

1134
00:57:36,791 --> 00:57:38,050
lost his recurve anyways.

1135
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:42,160
So just for the simple fact that you can
make them and make arrows very quickly.

1136
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:44,260
They don't need to worry about how you
ever sourced parts.

1137
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:46,000
But,
but they have all this other stuff like

1138
00:57:46,001 --> 00:57:47,890
machete blades and all these different
things.

1139
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:50,400
It seems like they would.
I mean,

1140
00:57:50,890 --> 00:57:53,540
if you get a good compound boat,
Jesus Christ,

1141
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:55,800
I think if you brought one down and left
it there,

1142
00:57:56,550 --> 00:57:58,200
I think if you brought one down and left
there,

1143
00:57:58,201 --> 00:58:01,330
I would get a lot of use will under.
Absolutely.

1144
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:05,290
Would it be too effective?
Like would they run into problems with,

1145
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:07,720
you know,
like they have kind of a sustainability

1146
00:58:07,721 --> 00:58:08,260
issue,
right?

1147
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:09,100
I'll say.
Yeah,

1148
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:12,080
I think that if you went down,
um,

1149
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:17,110
this is speculation.
I would think if you went down and gave

1150
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,480
it,
if you had down with a dozen of these

1151
00:58:19,481 --> 00:58:24,481
things and left them there,
I think that along that river corridor

1152
00:58:26,730 --> 00:58:31,450
you would see a diminishment of a
handful of bird species for sure.

1153
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:33,790
Yeah.
I would think because the birds.

1154
00:58:33,791 --> 00:58:37,150
But here's the thing,
here's why it's a little bit tricky

1155
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:41,020
because I think that you would also be
reducing demand because one of the

1156
00:58:41,021 --> 00:58:45,910
things about the birds,
the Guano and curtis owls is that they

1157
00:58:45,911 --> 00:58:48,820
want them to fletch arrows,
but they're hard to get.

1158
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:51,950
So they really want them because they
liked the,

1159
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:55,720
they classify them under this broad
category that you hear in other places

1160
00:58:55,721 --> 00:58:59,440
called police and basically it's like a
term,

1161
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:02,650
some people say Paul always refers to a
specific career,

1162
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:05,200
but some people use pulleys like,
like,

1163
00:59:05,201 --> 00:59:06,460
uh,
like Turkey,

1164
00:59:06,461 --> 00:59:10,570
like bird,
like a Turkey being a good edible birds.

1165
00:59:10,930 --> 00:59:15,910
So the birds that they fletch arrows
with are also coveted food items.

1166
00:59:16,230 --> 00:59:18,340
All right.
I would,

1167
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:19,390
I feel that,
yeah,

1168
00:59:19,391 --> 00:59:23,450
if you were to bring conventional
archery tackle in,

1169
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:26,870
you would see that diminished.
Now other people will have shotguns,

1170
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:30,020
but the limiting factor there is how
expensive the ammunition is.

1171
00:59:30,170 --> 00:59:35,150
So they'll have like the shotgun shell
or they might have a handful of shotgun

1172
00:59:35,151 --> 00:59:38,420
shells that would last them a long time
because it would own use when absolutely

1173
00:59:38,421 --> 00:59:40,040
necessary.
Like the Villa David,

1174
00:59:40,070 --> 00:59:43,610
they've been having a Jaguar problem
when we were there.

1175
00:59:44,210 --> 00:59:49,210
They had over the previous two months,
last 24 dogs including a dog while we

1176
00:59:50,301 --> 00:59:53,780
were there to a Jaguar who comes in at
night and kills dogs and chickens.

1177
00:59:54,260 --> 00:59:59,180
He was speculating that at some point in
time they will probably have to get rid

1178
00:59:59,181 --> 01:00:04,181
of that Jaguar and that it would be a
firearm issue there would have to like

1179
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:06,350
figure out a solution for with a
firearm.

1180
01:00:06,710 --> 01:00:08,930
So even people that might have a
firearm,

1181
01:00:09,330 --> 01:00:14,210
I'm have limited ammunition and it's
sort of a,

1182
01:00:14,580 --> 01:00:16,040
a,
a league,

1183
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:19,280
a tricky spot and the legal situation
for them to have a firearm.

1184
01:00:19,730 --> 01:00:23,480
But Bose I think that they would knock
the shit out of carousels and Guano if

1185
01:00:23,481 --> 01:00:26,630
they had good bose but then might not
want them as heavily because it didn't

1186
01:00:26,631 --> 01:00:31,631
need the fletching for fishing.
I think they're tackle superior close to

1187
01:00:31,971 --> 01:00:34,070
superior for bow fishing.
Why is that?

1188
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:38,810
Because the shots are so close,
it just isn't really necessary.

1189
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:41,090
Like it's like it's not,
it's just not necessary to have that

1190
01:00:41,091 --> 01:00:44,960
kind of investment and you just tend to
lose arrows,

1191
01:00:44,961 --> 01:00:47,480
bow fishing.
So it wouldn't make sense to have very

1192
01:00:47,481 --> 01:00:50,690
expensive fiberglass arrows when you can
make an Arrow and 15 minutes,

1193
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:51,740
20 minutes.
Yeah,

1194
01:00:51,741 --> 01:00:54,080
that makes sense.
And then you're still limited to very

1195
01:00:54,081 --> 01:00:56,320
close range shots.
Um,

1196
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:58,910
the,
like when I was in Bolivia where they

1197
01:00:58,911 --> 01:01:02,390
hunt for a bigger variety of stuff,
including monkeys,

1198
01:01:02,870 --> 01:01:04,720
a bose would be a gay,
like,

1199
01:01:05,030 --> 01:01:08,350
like compound bows be a real game
changer on monkey hunting.

1200
01:01:08,990 --> 01:01:13,550
So they're not monkey hunting and they
won't touch them really that.

1201
01:01:13,730 --> 01:01:15,680
Here's the couple.
There's a couple of things that are

1202
01:01:15,681 --> 01:01:17,390
really hard to talk.
Earlier I was saying like,

1203
01:01:17,391 --> 01:01:22,100
you have this luxury of being able to
have good conversations in English and

1204
01:01:22,101 --> 01:01:23,660
get your aunts,
your questions answered,

1205
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:25,610
right?
Some things you really,

1206
01:01:25,730 --> 01:01:27,830
uh,
you hit a wall.

1207
01:01:28,070 --> 01:01:29,060
Okay.
Now,

1208
01:01:29,150 --> 01:01:31,730
one of the things you hit a wall on is
if you say to someone like,

1209
01:01:32,270 --> 01:01:35,750
how many days out of the year would you
guess you do x?

1210
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:40,590
It just like you never get there.
You never get there.

1211
01:01:40,610 --> 01:01:43,050
Did they not understand years now?
They do,

1212
01:01:43,051 --> 01:01:43,884
but it's just like,

1213
01:01:46,450 --> 01:01:49,330
because we speak in that way,
it's hard for me to understand why

1214
01:01:49,331 --> 01:01:50,860
that's such a hard question.
But you,

1215
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:55,920
it would be very hard to get
satisfactory answers about how often do

1216
01:01:56,021 --> 01:01:59,710
you do something.
Another thing is like,

1217
01:01:59,740 --> 01:02:03,940
how much do you like?
Like do you like hunting or fishing more

1218
01:02:04,180 --> 01:02:07,390
isn't something that's thought about
because it'd be like,

1219
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:09,400
I'll be like,
do you like to hunt more,

1220
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:11,950
are far more?
You have to do both.

1221
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:15,370
So it's not like the luxury that we
have.

1222
01:02:15,371 --> 01:02:18,400
But what do you like?
But I don't have to do both.

1223
01:02:18,670 --> 01:02:22,920
You can't do one,
but he was telling you he hunts two days

1224
01:02:22,921 --> 01:02:25,140
a week.
He farms two days a week.

1225
01:02:25,141 --> 01:02:30,030
So we meet like asking the same question
a thousand times and finally kind of

1226
01:02:30,031 --> 01:02:34,950
getting finally kind of getting to a
spot because they couched it because one

1227
01:02:34,951 --> 01:02:36,330
time I pushed him and pushed and pushed
him.

1228
01:02:36,330 --> 01:02:38,850
How many days a year do you hunt and
fish and we've talked about this for

1229
01:02:38,851 --> 01:02:42,810
forever and he came up with the figure
maybe 200 or 250.

1230
01:02:43,170 --> 01:02:45,990
Then later I'm like,
how many days a week do you hunt and

1231
01:02:45,991 --> 01:02:48,000
fish.
And I asked them that a thousand times

1232
01:02:48,001 --> 01:02:51,000
and got to know if you do the math.
One of those numbers is wrong.

1233
01:02:51,630 --> 01:02:54,810
It's just not.
And it also like what you like most.

1234
01:02:55,170 --> 01:02:56,700
Do you like this most like that?
Most.

1235
01:02:57,030 --> 01:03:00,230
Another thing is why don't you eat x?
Right?

1236
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:04,380
But if I think about it,
if imagine if someone came from another

1237
01:03:04,381 --> 01:03:09,381
country to here and you're driving them
around and every single thing they see

1238
01:03:10,710 --> 01:03:12,900
that's alive.
If they said to you,

1239
01:03:12,901 --> 01:03:15,110
why don't you eat that?
Right?

1240
01:03:15,370 --> 01:03:17,000
Why don't you eat that spider?
Right?

1241
01:03:18,050 --> 01:03:20,040
I don't know Bro.
We just don't eat those spiders.

1242
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:21,360
Why don't you eat that cat?

1243
01:03:22,170 --> 01:03:23,850
That's a really complicated question.
Like,

1244
01:03:24,710 --> 01:03:27,060
uh,
we don't eat house cats.

1245
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:31,530
Let me count the reasons why we don't
eat house cats,

1246
01:03:31,890 --> 01:03:32,850
you know,
so,

1247
01:03:32,851 --> 01:03:34,350
and I'm like,
why don't you eat monkeys?

1248
01:03:34,351 --> 01:03:35,250
He's not like,
oh,

1249
01:03:35,251 --> 01:03:37,200
silly.
We don't eat monkeys because it's just

1250
01:03:37,201 --> 01:03:40,260
like we just don't eat monkeys,
but they don't have any weird

1251
01:03:40,261 --> 01:03:41,510
relationship with monkeys,
right?

1252
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:41,850
No,
none.

1253
01:03:41,850 --> 01:03:44,310
The more I press them on it,
it wound up being he would say,

1254
01:03:44,311 --> 01:03:48,180
because we have so many fish and they're
so easy to get a bite.

1255
01:03:48,181 --> 01:03:52,680
You hunt white lip peccary now white lip
peccary for folks who don't know.

1256
01:03:52,770 --> 01:03:54,990
And He.
Does that look like a Havalina as well?

1257
01:03:55,050 --> 01:03:56,870
Yeah.
So it's a little bigger than handling

1258
01:03:56,890 --> 01:03:59,130
the main difference from,
from a human,

1259
01:03:59,430 --> 01:04:03,150
a human perspective.
Looking on the to what you would.

1260
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:08,940
What you would jump at is the gregarious
nature of the white lip peccary.

1261
01:04:11,970 --> 01:04:14,100
So there's three peccaries,
there's like the Cohen,

1262
01:04:14,890 --> 01:04:18,480
I think the Chaco and Peccary,
which I've never laid eyes on,

1263
01:04:18,481 --> 01:04:23,481
White Lipson and collared and the
collared peccary a dozen is a giant

1264
01:04:23,761 --> 01:04:27,000
group of colored pack.
That's like a big ass group of collared

1265
01:04:27,001 --> 01:04:28,860
peccary.
And that's what we have in this sucker.

1266
01:04:29,010 --> 01:04:31,500
Yeah.
And that's what we have in west Texas,

1267
01:04:32,130 --> 01:04:35,550
Arizona,
parts of New Mexico,

1268
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:37,230
right.
So it's essentially the same thing as a

1269
01:04:37,270 --> 01:04:39,840
humbling.
The collared peccary is the havoline.

1270
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:43,640
Same exact thing.
The white lip peccary November,

1271
01:04:43,650 --> 01:04:46,170
I said like a dozen is a bunch of
collards.

1272
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:49,140
Have Lean.
I've hunted those in the US and 700

1273
01:04:49,141 --> 01:04:51,600
those in Mexico.
White Pack.

1274
01:04:51,601 --> 01:04:56,601
We'll run in a group of 100 to 200 whoa.
And white lipped peccaries when I was

1275
01:04:58,291 --> 01:05:02,670
mentioning in cassava,
white lipped peccaries are hell on

1276
01:05:02,671 --> 01:05:03,780
cassava.
Patches.

1277
01:05:03,870 --> 01:05:06,060
They eat them.
They come and meet the stalks,

1278
01:05:06,330 --> 01:05:07,163
not the route.

1279
01:05:07,230 --> 01:05:09,750
They'll destroy the cassava patch and
they'll dig,

1280
01:05:09,751 --> 01:05:12,330
but they particularly liked eat this.
They'll come in and they like to eat.

1281
01:05:12,331 --> 01:05:13,860
The young shoots growing up.
Now,

1282
01:05:13,861 --> 01:05:17,010
can they eat the cassava the route or is
it poisonous to them?

1283
01:05:17,110 --> 01:05:18,160
Don't know.
I don't know.

1284
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:20,680
Huh?
That's a good question.

1285
01:05:20,681 --> 01:05:22,300
I'll wish I would've asked that.
I would.

1286
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:24,910
If I had a week,
I would get a satisfactory answer out of

1287
01:05:24,911 --> 01:05:28,330
that.
So the white lipped peccaries will come

1288
01:05:28,331 --> 01:05:33,331
into the village and raise holy hell.
Everyone running grabs their bows and

1289
01:05:34,661 --> 01:05:38,800
then they start shooting in the nail,
chase them into the jungle and maybe

1290
01:05:38,801 --> 01:05:42,310
even track them for a day trying to
whittle away at them because it's a

1291
01:05:42,311 --> 01:05:45,250
great meat.
It's like the favorite game meat is

1292
01:05:45,251 --> 01:05:47,260
white lip packery.
They like it better than collared

1293
01:05:47,261 --> 01:05:51,760
peccary because they're bigger,
but is it like a pork or something like

1294
01:05:51,761 --> 01:05:53,770
that where they had like scent glands,
so they're very.

1295
01:05:53,770 --> 01:05:57,430
Yeah,
looks like pork has a very strong off

1296
01:05:57,431 --> 01:06:00,100
putting.
The animal has a very strong offputting

1297
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:03,220
smell,
but the meat doesn't know if you handle

1298
01:06:03,221 --> 01:06:05,650
it properly and keep it clean.
It's never.

1299
01:06:05,651 --> 01:06:10,651
It would never be regarded like as as
good as pork to the American palate,

1300
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:15,820
but to the Macusa Palette,
it's the best,

1301
01:06:17,050 --> 01:06:19,630
so their whole thing that we don't want
all these animals,

1302
01:06:19,631 --> 01:06:21,460
various animals,
because you have so many fish,

1303
01:06:21,461 --> 01:06:23,830
flies out the window with white lip
peccary,

1304
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:27,370
but a lot of the white lipped peccary
hunting is also related to the

1305
01:06:27,371 --> 01:06:31,960
protecting of crops.
Now as long as Rovan can remember,

1306
01:06:33,370 --> 01:06:38,370
real village has had a group of white
lipped peccaries that would come through

1307
01:06:38,891 --> 01:06:43,891
the area trying to raid the gardens and
when it came to the area raiding the

1308
01:06:44,381 --> 01:06:47,410
gardens,
they would kill some number of them and

1309
01:06:47,411 --> 01:06:50,680
then they would track them into the
jungle and stick with them and kill a

1310
01:06:50,681 --> 01:06:51,514
handful.

1311
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:54,160
And it was when that happened was a very
good thing.

1312
01:06:54,790 --> 01:06:59,790
They liked the peccaries.
There's been a number of years where no

1313
01:07:00,391 --> 01:07:02,560
packer,
where something happened to this group

1314
01:07:02,561 --> 01:07:06,520
of one or 200 peccaries they haven't for
years.

1315
01:07:06,521 --> 01:07:11,521
They have not been through the village.
It's not attrition because he was saying

1316
01:07:11,830 --> 01:07:16,120
at the most when we get,
when they come through and get us,

1317
01:07:16,150 --> 01:07:21,150
he would say on average we would get
actually kill between one and four when

1318
01:07:23,261 --> 01:07:27,280
they come in and hit the crops if we
stick with them and a group of guys goes

1319
01:07:27,281 --> 01:07:29,830
after me,
white killed between one and four and

1320
01:07:29,831 --> 01:07:31,200
there's 200 of them.
So it's like,

1321
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:33,400
it's not like that.
Like slowly whittle away at them.

1322
01:07:33,401 --> 01:07:35,620
Right.
It just would never account for that.

1323
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:41,160
But they vanished.
Robin never wanted to explain to me why

1324
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:45,400
they vanished,
but if I kept pestering him about it and

1325
01:07:45,401 --> 01:07:46,960
eventually he told me,
here's the deal.

1326
01:07:49,380 --> 01:07:53,580
Since [inaudible] villages now so
wealthy and we have so much food,

1327
01:07:55,350 --> 01:07:59,370
other groups and other villages have
grown very jealous of us

1328
01:08:01,300 --> 01:08:06,300
and he told me that a shaman in another
village got so insanely jealous of

1329
01:08:10,891 --> 01:08:15,891
[inaudible] prosperity through fishing
for [inaudible] and through all the good

1330
01:08:16,101 --> 01:08:18,260
hunting and fishing that they have
there,

1331
01:08:18,330 --> 01:08:23,120
that he got so jealous that he.
I'm locked up,

1332
01:08:23,330 --> 01:08:26,120
that this shaman locked up there
peccaries.

1333
01:08:26,270 --> 01:08:30,710
He doesn't know where perhaps in the
mountains they're locked up.

1334
01:08:31,700 --> 01:08:36,170
Now
getting them out is getting them

1335
01:08:36,171 --> 01:08:41,171
unlocked is difficult because at the
time that this shaman locked up there

1336
01:08:41,211 --> 01:08:44,510
peccaries,
they happened to be without a good

1337
01:08:44,511 --> 01:08:49,511
showman in their village that they have
a bad shot when they have a shaman in

1338
01:08:49,701 --> 01:08:51,020
training his,
his.

1339
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:56,210
He is a young sham and in training and
his powers are slow to develop.

1340
01:08:56,930 --> 01:08:58,730
So what happened to the old guy,
Donald?

1341
01:09:00,310 --> 01:09:02,630
This guy's powers have been slow to
develop.

1342
01:09:03,740 --> 01:09:08,740
He's getting there and soon he will
hopefully be in a position to unlock the

1343
01:09:10,821 --> 01:09:11,200
packer.

1344
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:13,980
Now what's a young showman?
Is it like a young president?

1345
01:09:14,370 --> 01:09:15,880
Like I didn't mean.
Oh,

1346
01:09:16,110 --> 01:09:19,640
does it really?
Like we brought up wanting to go talk to

1347
01:09:19,641 --> 01:09:22,970
him.
I got the sense that that wasn't the

1348
01:09:22,971 --> 01:09:26,480
best idea to go visit with him.
Really?

1349
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:28,300
Yeah,
to like 300 people in the village.

1350
01:09:28,310 --> 01:09:30,320
Three hundred and five.
Wow.

1351
01:09:30,380 --> 01:09:31,380
Got It.
Got It.

1352
01:09:31,390 --> 01:09:34,070
And I brought up a number of times.
Just got the sense that it wasn't the

1353
01:09:34,071 --> 01:09:35,540
greatest idea to go talk to.
So is there,

1354
01:09:35,541 --> 01:09:40,541
theatrical involves this guy like living
on the outskirts of town and he was in

1355
01:09:40,611 --> 01:09:45,600
town but no claims mystery.
So here's a handful of things that was

1356
01:09:45,700 --> 01:09:48,360
like,
Roman was telling me and in it,

1357
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:49,520
and I want to say,
man,

1358
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:54,080
I do not like if I'm here.
Okay.

1359
01:09:54,081 --> 01:09:57,320
If you told me something that I thought
was outlandish,

1360
01:09:57,840 --> 01:09:59,150
I would fucking jump on you.

1361
01:09:59,150 --> 01:10:00,440
Right.
And I'd be like,

1362
01:10:00,441 --> 01:10:05,441
that's ridiculous right now.
That desire to like be right and to

1363
01:10:06,710 --> 01:10:11,710
dispel a wrongness like I don't have a
lick of that shit when I'm talking to

1364
01:10:12,951 --> 01:10:14,330
these guys.
Right,

1365
01:10:14,390 --> 01:10:15,830
right.
I've never like,

1366
01:10:15,831 --> 01:10:17,450
wow,
I don't buy that.

1367
01:10:17,470 --> 01:10:19,670
Right.
It's just like it's so inappropriate.

1368
01:10:19,730 --> 01:10:20,600
Right.
Feeling.

1369
01:10:20,870 --> 01:10:23,300
Right.
And it's so interesting to me and also

1370
01:10:23,301 --> 01:10:28,301
give such an interesting glimpse into
how most cultures and societies were

1371
01:10:28,491 --> 01:10:33,020
structured
long time in pre Christian Times.

1372
01:10:33,260 --> 01:10:34,100
Right.
That it's just like,

1373
01:10:34,101 --> 01:10:36,200
it's just educational.
So I'm not in any way.

1374
01:10:36,201 --> 01:10:37,470
I'm never saying like,
wow,

1375
01:10:37,471 --> 01:10:39,410
I don't buy that.
I'm just saying like,

1376
01:10:39,411 --> 01:10:40,244
oh,
okay.

1377
01:10:40,850 --> 01:10:41,960
Right.
That's great.

1378
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:44,460
Thanks for sharing.
So magic.

1379
01:10:44,510 --> 01:10:45,900
Yeah.
So I'm not in any way I,

1380
01:10:45,901 --> 01:10:47,630
I've never like,
here's some things that were explained

1381
01:10:47,631 --> 01:10:49,900
to me.
If you're having a problem or you're,

1382
01:10:50,630 --> 01:10:55,630
your archery skills go downhill,
like you have a few misses the way to

1383
01:10:56,571 --> 01:11:00,280
correct that would be to go up and take
the hand,

1384
01:11:00,330 --> 01:11:05,330
hold the bowstring and punch a beehive
and then hold your hand up to that hive

1385
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:14,320
because they don't miss
and you will find you will.

1386
01:11:15,230 --> 01:11:18,980
They will demonstrate their accuracy
when they bombard you.

1387
01:11:19,430 --> 01:11:23,210
And Robin was saying that most of them
even know to hit you between your

1388
01:11:23,211 --> 01:11:26,720
fingers where it really hurts.
You will then absorb

1389
01:11:28,730 --> 01:11:33,730
that accuracy in your hand and you will
do a lot better shooting.

1390
01:11:35,390 --> 01:11:38,090
Huh?
And the more you can do this throughout

1391
01:11:38,091 --> 01:11:39,950
your life,
the strong group will make you.

1392
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:45,280
It's also helpful just even with kids is
also helpful to beat him by like a

1393
01:11:45,951 --> 01:11:48,450
bullet ant for instance.
Um,

1394
01:11:49,130 --> 01:11:50,900
I had the hat and before,
and it's awful,

1395
01:11:50,901 --> 01:11:54,350
but to get hit by a bullet ant to absorb
some of the ant strength,

1396
01:11:54,890 --> 01:11:59,890
but this sharman that fucked up there.
Peccaries could also just be jealous of

1397
01:12:01,161 --> 01:12:01,531
you.
And,

1398
01:12:01,531 --> 01:12:03,980
and strip your ability to shoot
accurately.

1399
01:12:06,270 --> 01:12:09,510
And what I want to point out that robin
has an email address.

1400
01:12:10,710 --> 01:12:12,180
Right?
Wow.

1401
01:12:12,270 --> 01:12:13,500
Yeah.
You can email.

1402
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:15,480
I email with them.
Wow.

1403
01:12:15,990 --> 01:12:20,430
And he's firm in his beliefs but also
also.

1404
01:12:20,460 --> 01:12:22,200
Yeah.
But there's also a rational.

1405
01:12:22,220 --> 01:12:25,410
It's,
he seems fairly rational outside of

1406
01:12:25,411 --> 01:12:26,244
this.

1407
01:12:26,690 --> 01:12:30,620
Listen,
it's like I'm torn even talking about it

1408
01:12:30,650 --> 01:12:33,680
because like I don't want it.
I'm sort of talking about it because,

1409
01:12:34,310 --> 01:12:39,140
because I have such a love for him as a
person,

1410
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:42,110
uh,
that I wouldn't want to say that would

1411
01:12:42,111 --> 01:12:45,050
make,
that would like dispel that idea of like

1412
01:12:45,410 --> 01:12:45,950
did,
did,

1413
01:12:45,950 --> 01:12:47,870
did he did.
He's not like that.

1414
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:50,660
He's not perfectly rational.
Like I would go anywhere with this guy

1415
01:12:51,860 --> 01:12:53,930
extremely capable.
But you're talking about

1416
01:12:53,930 --> 01:12:55,930
just like some,
some long held beliefs.

1417
01:12:55,970 --> 01:12:59,420
So it's their cultural belief systems
are just deeply ingrained and there's

1418
01:12:59,421 --> 01:13:02,000
probably some sort of a placebo effect
attached to all this.

1419
01:13:02,510 --> 01:13:06,950
They've seen it in effect,
someone has cast what is a,

1420
01:13:07,430 --> 01:13:08,850
there's a,
some point in time those,

1421
01:13:08,910 --> 01:13:10,370
those packers are going to come back
into town.

1422
01:13:10,610 --> 01:13:13,040
Yeah.
And then what were credit fall?

1423
01:13:13,430 --> 01:13:15,560
They'll probably say the Shaman has
relaxed grip.

1424
01:13:15,620 --> 01:13:18,480
Awesome.
The new sholman yeah.

1425
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:22,100
Or if someone wants credit,
it's just a way of explaining the

1426
01:13:22,101 --> 01:13:23,360
volatility.
Here's the other thing.

1427
01:13:23,390 --> 01:13:24,223
Here's the other thing,

1428
01:13:24,260 --> 01:13:26,340
like,
you know,

1429
01:13:26,420 --> 01:13:28,850
you could go,
well,

1430
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:31,730
let me give you example.
I'm going to make a point about the way,

1431
01:13:31,820 --> 01:13:34,700
um,
to sort of see a culture in transition,

1432
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:36,320
right?
Because it's always so relative.

1433
01:13:36,321 --> 01:13:37,510
But,
uh,

1434
01:13:37,550 --> 01:13:39,590
the,
there's a writer as a staff writer at

1435
01:13:39,591 --> 01:13:42,200
the New Yorker or one of my favorite
journalists of all time.

1436
01:13:42,201 --> 01:13:44,150
John Lee Anderson.
You might be familiar this book,

1437
01:13:44,151 --> 01:13:48,440
Jay,
like he wrote sort of the definitive Che

1438
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:49,273
Guevara Book,
Che.

1439
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:53,600
Um,
he's a war correspondent rights troubled

1440
01:13:53,630 --> 01:13:55,520
spots around the country around the
world.

1441
01:13:55,521 --> 01:13:58,580
John Lee Anderson,
he wrote a piece not long ago in the New

1442
01:13:58,580 --> 01:14:02,480
Yorker about a group of people that
were,

1443
01:14:02,481 --> 01:14:06,590
had just made that we're,
we're making first contact with the

1444
01:14:06,591 --> 01:14:08,180
outside world.
Just recently,

1445
01:14:08,370 --> 01:14:11,180
2015.
They had been.

1446
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:14,650
They were regard.
They were initially regarded as an

1447
01:14:14,651 --> 01:14:19,651
uncontacted group that lived in the
border between Peru and Brazil in the

1448
01:14:20,021 --> 01:14:22,210
jungle.
And for whatever reason,

1449
01:14:22,211 --> 01:14:27,211
they started coming out to a main river
where they were having some contact with

1450
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:30,500
other groups and they killed a couple
people,

1451
01:14:30,570 --> 01:14:31,403
bose.

1452
01:14:32,290 --> 01:14:37,120
So the government was in a situation of
when dealing with a first contact group,

1453
01:14:37,540 --> 01:14:41,680
you can't go in and just start putting
people on trial and shit.

1454
01:14:41,681 --> 01:14:43,920
Like it only leads to more problems.
So they were trying to.

1455
01:14:44,100 --> 01:14:47,770
It's an article about the difficulties
of leading,

1456
01:14:48,410 --> 01:14:53,260
of introducing a first contact people's
into sort of a constructive engagement

1457
01:14:53,590 --> 01:14:58,270
with the outside world.
I'm a trick there is some people look

1458
01:14:58,420 --> 01:15:02,890
and they have some countries have a
policy of isolation for uncontacted

1459
01:15:02,891 --> 01:15:07,891
people and try to enforce isolation.
Other theorists on this or other

1460
01:15:09,191 --> 01:15:12,010
anthropologists think that's completely
unfair.

1461
01:15:12,490 --> 01:15:17,490
That is the most human of tendencies is
to find other humans and swap ideas with

1462
01:15:20,021 --> 01:15:21,130
them.
Right.

1463
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:25,330
It's like it's you.
It would be laughable that I would come

1464
01:15:25,331 --> 01:15:27,580
to you and say,
Joe,

1465
01:15:27,581 --> 01:15:30,430
I'd like to prevent you from meeting the
French.

1466
01:15:30,550 --> 01:15:33,880
Less.
Some aspects of Frenchness rub off on,

1467
01:15:33,881 --> 01:15:35,770
you know,
they're worried about other things too,

1468
01:15:35,771 --> 01:15:37,480
but they're worried about like disease
and stuff.

1469
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:41,200
But also a tendency to to the alcohol
can be destructive,

1470
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:45,130
being lured into prostitution,
all forms of exploitation,

1471
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:48,190
trying to protect people from this.
Then there are also the romance of

1472
01:15:48,191 --> 01:15:51,550
running into these uncontacted tribes as
such that some people.

1473
01:15:51,551 --> 01:15:53,290
Yeah,
so some people say those photos that

1474
01:15:53,291 --> 01:15:56,290
they took from the helicopter where they
see these people are covered in war

1475
01:15:56,291 --> 01:15:57,700
paint.
They're pointing arrows at the

1476
01:15:57,701 --> 01:15:58,510
helicopter.
Yeah.

1477
01:15:58,510 --> 01:16:01,420
It's amazing.
And that's the shit that I'm guilty of,

1478
01:16:01,590 --> 01:16:05,080
right?
Because even though that's what I was

1479
01:16:05,081 --> 01:16:07,510
going to lead up,
this thing where this battle I have in

1480
01:16:07,511 --> 01:16:08,520
my own mind,
right.

1481
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:11,530
That even though,
I mean they are far,

1482
01:16:11,531 --> 01:16:12,630
far away there,
you know,

1483
01:16:12,700 --> 01:16:15,160
far,
far removed from a first contact people.

1484
01:16:15,161 --> 01:16:15,791
They're not even,
like I said,

1485
01:16:15,791 --> 01:16:17,800
the guy's got an email address.
I'm not trying to paint this as

1486
01:16:17,801 --> 01:16:18,920
something is not right.

1487
01:16:19,060 --> 01:16:23,860
But at the same time they made their
bows from raw material out in the jungle

1488
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:28,480
and hunt and fish for all their protein.
I love that shit so much and I like

1489
01:16:28,481 --> 01:16:31,060
laying in bed.
If you told me you can never go back.

1490
01:16:31,930 --> 01:16:34,570
I want to lay in bed thinking about that
occurring,

1491
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:37,900
right?
I want to lay in bed thinking about a

1492
01:16:37,901 --> 01:16:42,901
guy having a problem with this shaman
because it's just so refreshing and

1493
01:16:43,661 --> 01:16:44,380
like,
like,

1494
01:16:44,380 --> 01:16:48,460
like mentally exhilarating.
So does know that that's going on.

1495
01:16:48,670 --> 01:16:52,870
So you get caught in this kind of a,
you get caught in this kind of.

1496
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:57,940
It's almost like the opposite.
It's like the opposite of colonialism or

1497
01:16:57,941 --> 01:17:00,280
something where you get caught this
thing of wine to be like,

1498
01:17:00,310 --> 01:17:05,230
oh these precious cute people.
If I could just keep them like how I

1499
01:17:05,231 --> 01:17:08,590
like them,
where they stirred my imagination.

1500
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:11,150
Yeah.
You know,

1501
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:13,850
I just want them to stay like how they
are because that's how I like them.

1502
01:17:13,851 --> 01:17:17,000
Like when I come down to visit,
I like to know that they're all doing

1503
01:17:17,001 --> 01:17:21,080
the shit that's interesting to me,
but they're in no way are they

1504
01:17:21,081 --> 01:17:24,530
perceiving their experience

1505
01:17:25,890 --> 01:17:28,980
in that way,
but you go down and see like in the

1506
01:17:28,981 --> 01:17:31,230
handful of years as much they change all
the time.

1507
01:17:31,231 --> 01:17:34,250
Right.
And the handful of years to see that,

1508
01:17:34,260 --> 01:17:39,260
just like practices are different,
dress is different.

1509
01:17:40,740 --> 01:17:42,180
Clothing.
Very different.

1510
01:17:42,330 --> 01:17:45,870
So you're just seeing it happen,
you're seeing in real time,

1511
01:17:46,140 --> 01:17:49,590
it happened in a fast way.
Now you might come up and be like,

1512
01:17:49,591 --> 01:17:51,900
oh,
and I was in the US and the pre internet

1513
01:17:51,901 --> 01:17:55,240
days and I came to the US and the post
Internet days and um,

1514
01:17:55,560 --> 01:18:00,090
it man is that place different,
but you're watching it like wherever you

1515
01:18:00,091 --> 01:18:02,820
live,
you're also seeing that happen too.

1516
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:07,680
So you're living that transition.
But to go to there and then come back

1517
01:18:07,681 --> 01:18:09,610
five years later,
uh,

1518
01:18:09,990 --> 01:18:11,850
and see things different.
It really,

1519
01:18:11,851 --> 01:18:14,250
um,
yeah man,

1520
01:18:14,330 --> 01:18:16,680
it fucking,
as much as I hate to admit it and is a

1521
01:18:16,681 --> 01:18:18,870
wrong is it is.
But just to be like absolutely up,

1522
01:18:19,050 --> 01:18:22,740
but like a kind of bummed me out.
So when you talk about,

1523
01:18:22,770 --> 01:18:24,060
when you saw it from a hunting
perspective,

1524
01:18:24,061 --> 01:18:26,850
because I tend to view the world through
a hunting and fishing perspective.

1525
01:18:27,250 --> 01:18:30,810
When you talk about bringing bows down,
my first thought is,

1526
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:31,920
oh,
that's no fun.

1527
01:18:32,820 --> 01:18:35,810
They shouldn't do that because I like
watching them a lot with the homemade

1528
01:18:35,820 --> 01:18:40,080
boats right now it's,
it's totally rational and it completely

1529
01:18:40,081 --> 01:18:41,070
makes sense.
Yeah.

1530
01:18:41,140 --> 01:18:42,110
It's just,
it's

1531
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:44,470
furness Dahlia,
and then you find it,

1532
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:47,430
you find it as it's changing,
you know,

1533
01:18:47,680 --> 01:18:51,970
as much as you know about the American
West as much as you told me about the

1534
01:18:51,971 --> 01:18:55,780
history of the American west and the
native Americans to see these people

1535
01:18:55,781 --> 01:19:00,781
that are essentially like in some ways
like the native Americans before the

1536
01:19:01,931 --> 01:19:03,570
colonial people arrive.

1537
01:19:03,640 --> 01:19:05,410
Yeah.
Or like a,

1538
01:19:05,411 --> 01:19:09,730
I guess it would be,
this is a bold statement.

1539
01:19:09,731 --> 01:19:11,860
If there's an anthropologist or a
historian listening,

1540
01:19:11,861 --> 01:19:13,240
they're going to pull their hair out,
but it would,

1541
01:19:13,241 --> 01:19:18,190
maybe it would be like I'm so hesitant
to even throw this out.

1542
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:22,060
Just it's extremely approximate and full
of holes and full of contradictions,

1543
01:19:22,510 --> 01:19:26,110
but some kind of post contact scenario
and I don't know,

1544
01:19:26,111 --> 01:19:28,930
like let's say it was the 18 nineties or
something right here.

1545
01:19:29,890 --> 01:19:32,020
The firearm was very much a part of
stuff,

1546
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:33,333
you know.
But yeah.

1547
01:19:34,330 --> 01:19:35,200
Um,
but you know,

1548
01:19:35,260 --> 01:19:36,160
it's,
it's makes,

1549
01:19:36,210 --> 01:19:39,580
it's complicated in the Internet age,
but at that time you definitely,

1550
01:19:39,581 --> 01:19:44,170
we definitely established a form of
terrorism in the American West right

1551
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:45,550
there by the,
you know,

1552
01:19:45,810 --> 01:19:46,241
I mean,
well,

1553
01:19:46,241 --> 01:19:51,241
before the Francis Parkman France
department was this figure,

1554
01:19:51,940 --> 01:19:54,880
he wrote the definitive history of the
French and Indian war.

1555
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:57,280
But in 18,
42,

1556
01:19:57,281 --> 01:19:59,830
he was a historian.
He had health problems in 18,

1557
01:19:59,831 --> 01:20:04,831
42,
he did a tourism trip out on to the

1558
01:20:05,711 --> 01:20:10,180
great plains.
He met some fur trappers,

1559
01:20:10,181 --> 01:20:13,770
some mountain men.
He traveled with the Oglala Sioux,

1560
01:20:15,900 --> 01:20:19,120
a crazy horse who probably wasn't crazy
horse yet.

1561
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:22,440
He was his name curly as a kid.
Crazy horse.

1562
01:20:22,470 --> 01:20:24,550
He was in crazy or like the three
stooges,

1563
01:20:24,940 --> 01:20:26,760
I think that,
I think that was like a name for mount,

1564
01:20:26,761 --> 01:20:29,320
you know,
and have no idea what it meant before he

1565
01:20:29,321 --> 01:20:31,570
adopted the name crazy horse.
Um,

1566
01:20:31,870 --> 01:20:36,870
he would have been 13 years old and
Francis partment traveled with them as a

1567
01:20:37,661 --> 01:20:40,360
tourist and they went into the black
hills of South Dakota.

1568
01:20:40,690 --> 01:20:44,480
They went in there to get lodge poles
because there was a time you were in

1569
01:20:44,481 --> 01:20:46,420
there,
go in and fit out their lodge poles for

1570
01:20:46,421 --> 01:20:49,180
their teepees to replace broken
lodgepoles.

1571
01:20:49,210 --> 01:20:52,540
They went up in the black hills,
killed some big horn sheep by throwing

1572
01:20:52,541 --> 01:20:54,160
rocks down on him,
off a cliff,

1573
01:20:54,820 --> 01:20:58,000
went and shot a bunch of buffalo and he
was out there like as a tourist,

1574
01:20:58,930 --> 01:21:00,670
so tourism in the American West.

1575
01:21:01,090 --> 01:21:06,090
Now you got to remember the last,
the last free roaming,

1576
01:21:08,140 --> 01:21:13,140
the last like non confined plains
Indians didn't get rounded up until,

1577
01:21:15,100 --> 01:21:17,050
depending on your definition of 18,
76,

1578
01:21:17,051 --> 01:21:18,040
18,
77,

1579
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:21,940
so he was out there way before that.
There were still like what they

1580
01:21:22,060 --> 01:21:26,260
described at the time as hostile wild
Indians were running around and he was

1581
01:21:26,261 --> 01:21:29,710
traveling with them as a tourist.
So I just bring that up to bring this

1582
01:21:29,711 --> 01:21:33,580
idea that here's this group of people
who are very much engaged in terrorism.

1583
01:21:33,790 --> 01:21:37,840
Like I was down there.
I was down at because I wanted to go on

1584
01:21:37,841 --> 01:21:40,150
a river trip.
I walk in and it's something I've done a

1585
01:21:40,151 --> 01:21:44,120
handful of times.
I wanted to go on a river trip and and w

1586
01:21:44,120 --> 01:21:48,880
w and participate in their hunting and
fishing and food gathering activities as

1587
01:21:48,881 --> 01:21:53,200
they engage in them in the same way they
might engage in it if I wasn't there.

1588
01:21:54,070 --> 01:21:56,280
That's why we weren't fishing.
That's why we weren't catching air them

1589
01:21:56,290 --> 01:21:59,620
is letting them go.
So there's that in the Internet era,

1590
01:21:59,650 --> 01:22:01,690
but it's like there's that thing always
returned to.

1591
01:22:01,691 --> 01:22:03,220
It's like you're still,
you're still

1592
01:22:05,070 --> 01:22:08,100
hunting and fishing all your own food or
growing in your yard now.

1593
01:22:08,101 --> 01:22:11,220
When you guys went down there,
did you participate in the hunting and

1594
01:22:11,221 --> 01:22:13,390
fishing or did you just observe?
No.

1595
01:22:13,410 --> 01:22:16,500
Participate in it.
You participated with their traditional

1596
01:22:16,501 --> 01:22:18,870
tackle or did you use your own stuff?
Done?

1597
01:22:18,871 --> 01:22:21,000
Both.
I've hunted fish with my own and I've

1598
01:22:21,001 --> 01:22:26,001
hunted fish with their bow and in the
end I wound up the first time I went

1599
01:22:26,131 --> 01:22:31,110
down I hunted fish the second time too,
I hunted for fish.

1600
01:22:31,111 --> 01:22:35,100
So both fished with um,
their gear.

1601
01:22:35,730 --> 01:22:40,730
But then it always felt like somehow
funny too because like there's the thing

1602
01:22:41,791 --> 01:22:43,350
that happens when you're watching like
goofy,

1603
01:22:43,980 --> 01:22:46,530
you know,
watched like goofy survival shows and

1604
01:22:46,531 --> 01:22:49,410
shit.
Desire is the part where the host,

1605
01:22:49,411 --> 01:22:53,100
you know,
grapples with how difficult it is to

1606
01:22:53,101 --> 01:22:58,101
master ancient technologies.
But you're trying to just pick it up and

1607
01:22:59,401 --> 01:23:00,540
do it from scratch.

1608
01:23:01,140 --> 01:23:05,100
Okay.
Rovan has been shooting that bow at

1609
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:07,870
four.
He's 32 years old.

1610
01:23:07,871 --> 01:23:12,490
He's been shooting that boat at fish for
let's say 27 years.

1611
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:16,330
It is not an unusual thing to him.
Alright.

1612
01:23:17,020 --> 01:23:19,000
So when you go pick it up and be like,
man,

1613
01:23:19,001 --> 01:23:21,550
you got to give props to,
these guys should be able to kill a

1614
01:23:21,551 --> 01:23:22,181
fish.
This bowl.

1615
01:23:22,181 --> 01:23:24,220
It's like,
well kind of in kind of not.

1616
01:23:24,221 --> 01:23:26,470
Because if you spent 27 years doing
something,

1617
01:23:26,471 --> 01:23:30,610
you're damn sure going to be good at it.
The same way is if you took someone like

1618
01:23:30,611 --> 01:23:35,611
one of these first contact people's from
between Peru and Brazil and handed them

1619
01:23:36,461 --> 01:23:38,320
my laptop and said,
hey,

1620
01:23:38,321 --> 01:23:43,321
pull up my g mail contacts from scratch.
He might be like,

1621
01:23:43,691 --> 01:23:45,520
man,
I gotta give props to you guys.

1622
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:48,470
Had no idea.
Right.

1623
01:23:48,680 --> 01:23:50,290
It's just like,
yeah.

1624
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:53,290
So I was having this conversation with
someone the other day where,

1625
01:23:53,370 --> 01:23:55,870
you know,
the first time Daniel Boone in 17,

1626
01:23:55,871 --> 01:23:57,880
60,
Daniel Boone went to the cumberland gap

1627
01:23:57,940 --> 01:24:02,500
for the first time and dropped down into
what's now Tennessee and Kentucky and he

1628
01:24:02,501 --> 01:24:03,940
stayed there hunting hides.

1629
01:24:03,970 --> 01:24:04,870
He was a hide hunters.
They,

1630
01:24:04,871 --> 01:24:07,270
they're hunting heights for two years,
ran out of gunpowder,

1631
01:24:07,390 --> 01:24:10,270
made his own gunpowder and made it out
of a bat.

1632
01:24:10,271 --> 01:24:14,350
Guano your own piss pot ash,
right?

1633
01:24:14,950 --> 01:24:16,420
You can cook this shit up.
Right.

1634
01:24:16,421 --> 01:24:19,570
And make your own gunpowder.
And I was looking at as being the

1635
01:24:19,571 --> 01:24:24,571
epitome of woodsmanship and the fact
that he could do it makes him seem other

1636
01:24:26,351 --> 01:24:27,910
worldly.
How do they,

1637
01:24:27,940 --> 01:24:30,010
what kind of formula do they have for
how much piss?

1638
01:24:30,011 --> 01:24:31,120
How much bat?
Guano,

1639
01:24:31,210 --> 01:24:33,280
which just something they knew.
Do you know the bat?

1640
01:24:33,281 --> 01:24:35,320
Guano used to be something that was so
cherished.

1641
01:24:35,321 --> 01:24:36,620
People would go to war for it.
Yeah,

1642
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:38,320
for explosive.
Fucking incredible.

1643
01:24:38,321 --> 01:24:40,420
Not just for explosive,
but also for fertilizer.

1644
01:24:40,540 --> 01:24:41,290
Oh,
no.

1645
01:24:41,290 --> 01:24:44,890
Yeah,
that's what the term batshit crazy like

1646
01:24:44,891 --> 01:24:47,800
the freezer bash.
People would fight for bat shit.

1647
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,710
Yeah.
They would go nuts like it was so

1648
01:24:50,711 --> 01:24:51,544
valuable.

1649
01:24:51,670 --> 01:24:54,640
That's where all the buffalo bones went
after the near extermination of the

1650
01:24:54,641 --> 01:24:58,600
buffalo really.
But the really good shit was bone China,

1651
01:24:58,720 --> 01:25:01,300
China,
tableware and everything else is

1652
01:25:01,301 --> 01:25:02,800
fertilizer.
Wow.

1653
01:25:02,870 --> 01:25:04,720
Yeah.
You could make the same.

1654
01:25:04,780 --> 01:25:07,210
Some of the same characters that were
involved in the slaughter involved in

1655
01:25:07,211 --> 01:25:08,830
picking out the bones are called bone
pickers.

1656
01:25:08,831 --> 01:25:10,060
Picked up fertilizer.
But no,

1657
01:25:10,061 --> 01:25:13,180
I didn't know that about Baghwan have no
idea that bone China.

1658
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:15,700
Yeah,
there's still bone China.

1659
01:25:16,090 --> 01:25:17,080
No kidding.
Yeah,

1660
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:20,500
I thought China was always some sort of
ceramic.

1661
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:24,040
There's a place in Detroit on the,
on the Rogue River in Detroit that have

1662
01:25:24,041 --> 01:25:25,510
the rouge river,
rogue river,

1663
01:25:25,511 --> 01:25:27,760
depending on what Dude Michigan you're
talking to.

1664
01:25:28,010 --> 01:25:31,270
Um,
there's a place there called the Detroit

1665
01:25:31,271 --> 01:25:36,271
carbon works that used to.
So when you're watching movies,

1666
01:25:37,661 --> 01:25:38,441
including the revenue,
you know,

1667
01:25:38,441 --> 01:25:43,441
that giant pyramid pile of buffalo
skulls that turns up in everywhere,

1668
01:25:45,220 --> 01:25:46,300
every book,
every movie.

1669
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:51,840
That photo was taken at the Detroit
carbon works and what they are producing

1670
01:25:52,721 --> 01:25:55,090
was bone fertilizer.
Wow.

1671
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:58,580
Is there more than one of those photos
everywhere?

1672
01:25:58,740 --> 01:26:00,370
Wow.
You can't escape that picture.

1673
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:01,960
That's an incredible picture.
That's.

1674
01:26:01,990 --> 01:26:03,830
That's taken in Detroit,
Michigan,

1675
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:08,150
where I'll point out was one of a
handful of states that never had buffalo

1676
01:26:08,180 --> 01:26:11,590
in the history in the history.
There's no buffalo,

1677
01:26:11,610 --> 01:26:13,640
Michigan,
so they're extra paid it out of

1678
01:26:13,790 --> 01:26:17,090
Michigan.
They just knows where those bones are

1679
01:26:17,091 --> 01:26:20,840
picked up in the American west ship by
rail to Minneapolis,

1680
01:26:20,841 --> 01:26:24,080
Chicago,
Detroit turned into bone fertilizer and

1681
01:26:24,081 --> 01:26:26,720
then shipped back out for people tilling
up the great plains.

1682
01:26:27,620 --> 01:26:29,090
Go back to that photo again.
The photo.

1683
01:26:29,091 --> 01:26:30,360
So disturbing.
Wow.

1684
01:26:30,410 --> 01:26:32,930
How many skulls is that?
In my book about Buffalo,

1685
01:26:33,020 --> 01:26:38,020
I'm describing that picture and I say
that the man standing on top is like an

1686
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:42,470
exclamation point at the end of a long
sentence about death and destruction

1687
01:26:44,740 --> 01:26:48,230
because I can look at them.
It's like he somehow realizes the

1688
01:26:48,231 --> 01:26:51,290
weirdness of what he's involved in,
but that was post extermination.

1689
01:26:51,710 --> 01:26:53,140
There's a crazy,
um,

1690
01:26:53,510 --> 01:26:58,380
podcasts from Dan Carlin on the wrath of
the cons on the GIG economy.

1691
01:26:58,430 --> 01:27:01,340
They describe how the charisma and Shaw
sends a,

1692
01:27:01,350 --> 01:27:03,950
a group to a checkout Gin,
China,

1693
01:27:04,010 --> 01:27:06,980
and they got there like about a year
after getting,

1694
01:27:06,981 --> 01:27:09,500
his con had killed everyone in the
entire city,

1695
01:27:09,501 --> 01:27:13,070
over a million people and they thought
what they saw in the distance they

1696
01:27:13,071 --> 01:27:16,520
thought was a snow cap mountain.
As they got closer,

1697
01:27:16,521 --> 01:27:18,440
they realized it was a pile of human
bones.

1698
01:27:18,460 --> 01:27:23,050
Really.
Those guys are hardcore shit.

1699
01:27:24,590 --> 01:27:25,720
Yeah.
Jonestown,

1700
01:27:25,730 --> 01:27:28,030
what do you.
But then nothing but be like,

1701
01:27:28,040 --> 01:27:28,700
oh,
minor.

1702
01:27:28,700 --> 01:27:30,230
I was like,
it'd be like a car crash.

1703
01:27:30,410 --> 01:27:33,230
He changed the carbon footprint of the
human race.

1704
01:27:33,650 --> 01:27:36,350
Him during his time,
they don't know how many people they

1705
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:40,010
have the population through deep
population cooking fires.

1706
01:27:40,110 --> 01:27:42,740
They,
they believe they killed more than 10

1707
01:27:42,741 --> 01:27:47,150
percent of the population,
like Gingiss Khan and his people through

1708
01:27:47,151 --> 01:27:50,810
his orders killed more than 10 percent
of the population of the world.

1709
01:27:51,110 --> 01:27:53,630
And wasn't he the number one

1710
01:27:54,490 --> 01:27:57,670
land conquer,
but just never held on anything.

1711
01:27:57,880 --> 01:28:01,480
Well,
conquered more in like conquered more

1712
01:28:01,481 --> 01:28:03,760
than Napoleon.
Conquered more than Hitler,

1713
01:28:03,761 --> 01:28:04,594
but just didn't hold it.

1714
01:28:04,790 --> 01:28:06,740
I'm not sure about that.
I don't know about that,

1715
01:28:06,741 --> 01:28:10,160
but I know that they always lived in
tents and they despised people that

1716
01:28:10,161 --> 01:28:12,200
lived in homes.
They thought they were pussies the

1717
01:28:12,201 --> 01:28:14,880
breath out after their life.
They brought out their vulnerable to

1718
01:28:15,590 --> 01:28:16,423
probably.
Right.

1719
01:28:16,760 --> 01:28:17,690
Yeah.
I mean,

1720
01:28:17,790 --> 01:28:20,930
is anybody listening a wrath of the
cons?

1721
01:28:20,931 --> 01:28:24,140
It's a five part series and I think Dan
Carlin,

1722
01:28:24,510 --> 01:28:26,600
he charges for them.
You can buy it on Itunes,

1723
01:28:26,601 --> 01:28:30,420
but I think it's only a dollar per and
is the best value over sees the World

1724
01:28:30,450 --> 01:28:31,550
War One.
Yes.

1725
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,830
Yeah,
and not sure what else he's done.

1726
01:28:33,860 --> 01:28:36,860
He's done a lot of.
I mean his podcast is just absolutely

1727
01:28:36,861 --> 01:28:40,130
amazing.
He's incredible and super humble.

1728
01:28:40,131 --> 01:28:44,780
Guy Won't call himself a historian,
but meanwhile has the best history

1729
01:28:44,840 --> 01:28:47,720
educational series you can get.
It's a buck,

1730
01:28:47,780 --> 01:28:51,140
a buck a piece and they were like an
hour and a half long and they're fucking

1731
01:28:51,141 --> 01:28:51,974
incredible.

1732
01:28:52,220 --> 01:28:53,630
Yeah,
he's a.

1733
01:28:53,631 --> 01:28:56,240
he's a real treasure.
That guy doesn't call himself in his

1734
01:28:56,241 --> 01:28:58,850
story because he doesn't use like
primary source material or something

1735
01:28:58,851 --> 01:29:02,070
just reads popular works.
I don't know why,

1736
01:29:02,170 --> 01:29:04,890
I mean,
I know he who owns the name,

1737
01:29:05,490 --> 01:29:08,220
who owns the definition,
he's just really humble,

1738
01:29:09,090 --> 01:29:14,040
but his main focus of study,
his entire life has been history,

1739
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:16,590
you know,
and when he does these things where it's

1740
01:29:16,890 --> 01:29:17,441
like,
well,

1741
01:29:17,441 --> 01:29:19,740
if he calls what he does at podcast,
I need to change.

1742
01:29:19,741 --> 01:29:24,260
What I do is I what I call a podcast.
It's just pales in comparison because

1743
01:29:24,270 --> 01:29:25,780
we're just sitting here talking.
Right?

1744
01:29:25,781 --> 01:29:27,900
Yeah.
Well he does as he prepares for these

1745
01:29:27,901 --> 01:29:32,010
things for months and sites,
different sources and different lunches

1746
01:29:32,011 --> 01:29:35,760
and then essentially does an educational
entertainment piece.

1747
01:29:36,470 --> 01:29:37,303
Yeah.

1748
01:29:37,410 --> 01:29:40,920
Maybe that's why he doesn't like the
term his star and his because he's not,

1749
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:44,640
um,
he's not contributing.

1750
01:29:45,180 --> 01:29:47,550
He's not contributing to the body of
knowledge.

1751
01:29:47,551 --> 01:29:48,670
He's interpreting the body.
Right,

1752
01:29:49,010 --> 01:29:50,100
right.
Maybe.

1753
01:29:50,220 --> 01:29:51,090
Yeah,
that's a good point.

1754
01:29:51,270 --> 01:29:51,841
Yeah.
Maybe.

1755
01:29:51,841 --> 01:29:53,760
I think he's just super humbled to.
He just wouldn't,

1756
01:29:54,060 --> 01:29:57,930
wouldn't say that no matter what,
but somehow,

1757
01:29:58,260 --> 01:30:02,550
I don't know why more disturbing to see
a pile of human bodies than it is to see

1758
01:30:02,551 --> 01:30:04,080
a pile of the buffalo bones.

1759
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:08,770
Yeah.
I think I told you I'm not talking about

1760
01:30:08,770 --> 01:30:11,410
a thousand times what after the custer
massacre,

1761
01:30:12,370 --> 01:30:17,370
the guys that that were following the
other soldiers who were coming in after

1762
01:30:18,131 --> 01:30:19,990
the massacre and they didn't know what
had happened.

1763
01:30:20,850 --> 01:30:24,080
You know they hadn't got word yet,
that custer and his entire command had

1764
01:30:24,081 --> 01:30:29,081
been wiped out by the Sioux and northern
Cheyenne and they're riding up the

1765
01:30:29,171 --> 01:30:33,310
valley and they're looking off in the
distance and they're in there see all

1766
01:30:33,311 --> 01:30:38,311
these sort of white bloody ish things
and all these dark brown things and one

1767
01:30:40,241 --> 01:30:43,510
of the guys wrote that.
Their initial impression looking at it

1768
01:30:44,110 --> 01:30:49,110
was that cost or must have caught the
Indians in the middle of a buffalo hunt

1769
01:30:50,290 --> 01:30:55,030
and what they were seeing was it was
summertime and they were seeing fatty

1770
01:30:55,031 --> 01:31:00,031
buffalo carcasses that had been skinned
and that the brown things where the

1771
01:31:00,371 --> 01:31:03,160
buffalo hides laid out next to the
carcass.

1772
01:31:03,730 --> 01:31:08,440
But when on closer inspection it was.
The brown things were horses,

1773
01:31:08,441 --> 01:31:10,840
cavalry,
horses and the white things were

1774
01:31:10,841 --> 01:31:12,490
stripped and mutilated soldiers.

1775
01:31:14,510 --> 01:31:18,290
A good image wasn't one of the guys,
one of the native Americans.

1776
01:31:18,291 --> 01:31:22,280
That was in the little big horn water,
whatever event.

1777
01:31:22,730 --> 01:31:25,730
Wasn't he?
One of the guys who toured with wild

1778
01:31:25,731 --> 01:31:26,810
bill?
Many of them.

1779
01:31:27,390 --> 01:31:30,000
So they were.
They had killed American soldiers and

1780
01:31:30,001 --> 01:31:30,834
then they went on this

1781
01:31:31,090 --> 01:31:32,710
entertainment tour.
Yeah.

1782
01:31:32,740 --> 01:31:37,740
It will be as though it would be like,
this is a fucking risky comparison.

1783
01:31:40,530 --> 01:31:43,180
Now I'm not even gonna say Nazi.
No,

1784
01:31:43,370 --> 01:31:44,010
no,
no,

1785
01:31:44,010 --> 01:31:45,760
I definitely was going to say that x is
way different.

1786
01:31:45,761 --> 01:31:47,200
It would be like a

1787
01:31:48,930 --> 01:31:49,763
shit.

1788
01:31:51,830 --> 01:31:53,900
I'm not going to say I don't want to
make the comparison.

1789
01:31:54,070 --> 01:31:55,580
It will come back to haunt me.
Um,

1790
01:31:55,590 --> 01:31:56,870
I'm trying to think of something that
would work.

1791
01:31:57,210 --> 01:31:58,011
It will be like,
uh,

1792
01:31:58,011 --> 01:32:00,190
uh,
people that we fought against later

1793
01:32:00,190 --> 01:32:02,260
became a media celebrity.
Yeah.

1794
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:04,000
Oh,
I guess they're kind of dealing with it

1795
01:32:04,001 --> 01:32:09,001
right now in Columbia where the Farc
right now that Columbia has struck a

1796
01:32:10,751 --> 01:32:15,751
peace accord with the FARC and the FARC
are entering into politics,

1797
01:32:16,211 --> 01:32:19,990
entering into media.
FARC commanders who spent their entire

1798
01:32:19,991 --> 01:32:21,970
life fighting against the Colombia
government.

1799
01:32:22,420 --> 01:32:24,940
Many atrocities were traded back and
forth.

1800
01:32:24,970 --> 01:32:29,650
They now come on the Columbia or
equivalent of 60 minutes to do

1801
01:32:29,651 --> 01:32:30,820
interviews.
Wow,

1802
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:35,710
okay.
So it's like where you have an adversary

1803
01:32:36,100 --> 01:32:41,050
that,
that hostilities end in the

1804
01:32:41,051 --> 01:32:45,340
reconciliation is so complete and so
quick that you can come,

1805
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:49,150
you can become a media personality.
And this guy was a touring media

1806
01:32:49,160 --> 01:32:51,940
personalities.
Dol Rule Guy,

1807
01:32:52,070 --> 01:32:52,841
right?
Yeah.

1808
01:32:52,841 --> 01:32:54,340
Girl,
who um,

1809
01:32:55,060 --> 01:32:57,190
the hospital's name,
the historian,

1810
01:32:57,191 --> 01:32:59,200
evanesce,
Connell,

1811
01:32:59,200 --> 01:32:59,441
Jesus,
Ge,

1812
01:32:59,441 --> 01:33:01,480
all.
And there's some photos of this guy,

1813
01:33:01,481 --> 01:33:02,410
right?
Yeah.

1814
01:33:02,411 --> 01:33:04,210
There are photos of him.
See if you can find that.

1815
01:33:04,810 --> 01:33:06,730
Evanesce O'connell he was,
he was huge.

1816
01:33:06,850 --> 01:33:07,870
And um,
the,

1817
01:33:07,871 --> 01:33:11,050
the novelist who wrote my favorite Costa
History,

1818
01:33:11,070 --> 01:33:13,630
uh,
he says that a girl went through

1819
01:33:13,631 --> 01:33:16,480
custer's men like a wolf through sheep
and um,

1820
01:33:18,310 --> 01:33:20,940
yeah.
So it's a hard look,

1821
01:33:21,010 --> 01:33:22,060
man.
He,

1822
01:33:22,090 --> 01:33:25,240
someone asked him how long it took,
how long that fight lasted.

1823
01:33:25,241 --> 01:33:29,380
He said it lasted about as long as it
takes a hungry man to eat his dinner.

1824
01:33:31,540 --> 01:33:34,930
Wow.
That is a hard look and gentlemen right

1825
01:33:34,931 --> 01:33:35,764
there.
Yeah.

1826
01:33:36,340 --> 01:33:37,540
That face,
man.

1827
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:40,750
So he toured all over the country.
People would pay to see them pay to get

1828
01:33:40,751 --> 01:33:42,580
their photos taken with them.
Wow.

1829
01:33:42,790 --> 01:33:47,710
He did selfies.
Selfies with people.

1830
01:33:47,860 --> 01:33:49,180
Wow.
What a crazy thing.

1831
01:33:49,181 --> 01:33:53,140
That must've been quite a while.
Had some mock war that they would do.

1832
01:33:53,590 --> 01:33:55,060
They would come out and reenact the
battle.

1833
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:56,420
Wow.

1834
01:33:57,530 --> 01:34:00,020
Yeah,
so you could go down and this would have

1835
01:34:00,021 --> 01:34:02,960
been in your own lifetime that people
who,

1836
01:34:03,410 --> 01:34:07,760
the families of the men killed at the
battle of little big horn could have

1837
01:34:07,761 --> 01:34:12,761
gone down and got their photo taken with
and paid to watch and interacted with

1838
01:34:13,400 --> 01:34:17,990
the gentleman who likely clover to their
father's head and with a Tomahawk.

1839
01:34:18,200 --> 01:34:23,200
Jesus Christ.
We're not as like we are thinking about

1840
01:34:23,961 --> 01:34:25,850
how much worse we are now.
Right.

1841
01:34:26,240 --> 01:34:29,810
Is that buffalo bill up there?
I don't know if that's him.

1842
01:34:30,750 --> 01:34:32,090
That's him,
but that's from his show.

1843
01:34:32,680 --> 01:34:33,513
Wow.

1844
01:34:34,470 --> 01:34:36,060
Pumps.
Are we going to say we're not that far

1845
01:34:36,061 --> 01:34:37,500
removed?
Oh No.

1846
01:34:37,501 --> 01:34:40,980
I was just saying like,
we now think we've gotten to such a

1847
01:34:40,981 --> 01:34:42,090
weird spot,
but yeah.

1848
01:34:42,091 --> 01:34:46,200
You want to point out that people must
have been a tad more forgiving at the

1849
01:34:46,201 --> 01:34:46,921
time.
Well,

1850
01:34:46,921 --> 01:34:49,470
there must have been much more used to
death and murder.

1851
01:34:49,880 --> 01:34:52,740
Yeah,
because it was so common and it's just,

1852
01:34:52,770 --> 01:34:57,770
it was so personal because you know,
you're doing it with hatchets axes and

1853
01:34:58,430 --> 01:35:02,300
guns that don't fire very well.
So you do it at close range shooting

1854
01:35:02,301 --> 01:35:05,300
people with muskets from and there was
so much more violence then.

1855
01:35:05,460 --> 01:35:07,580
Yeah.
So much more depth.

1856
01:35:08,100 --> 01:35:11,750
The fact that you grow up and be so old
now and never see a dead person is just

1857
01:35:11,751 --> 01:35:13,640
a new idea.
It is pretty crazy.

1858
01:35:13,950 --> 01:35:15,860
You know,
I got people my age have never seen a

1859
01:35:15,861 --> 01:35:17,000
dead guy.
Yeah.

1860
01:35:18,890 --> 01:35:21,080
Well it's a real eyeopener when you see
one.

1861
01:35:21,980 --> 01:35:24,350
There's a lot of people that haven't
even seen a dead animal.

1862
01:35:24,470 --> 01:35:25,040
Dude,
I could sit,

1863
01:35:25,040 --> 01:35:27,740
rattle off the dead people.
I've seen so many in my mind.

1864
01:35:28,280 --> 01:35:29,860
How many dead people have I seen?
Yeah.

1865
01:35:32,120 --> 01:35:33,140
Not 10.

1866
01:35:35,870 --> 01:35:40,870
What have you seen dead people from all?
I saw two people that were not just

1867
01:35:42,121 --> 01:35:46,350
dead,
but in bits after a plane crash I saw

1868
01:35:46,380 --> 01:35:48,160
where was that?
Fine.

1869
01:35:48,230 --> 01:35:50,640
Not even a mile from my house.
I was a little kid.

1870
01:35:50,840 --> 01:35:52,110
Yeah.
And then um,

1871
01:35:53,010 --> 01:35:56,070
and then a commercial plane or like one
of those little private,

1872
01:35:56,071 --> 01:35:58,440
sorry,
57 year old man and a 13 year old kid.

1873
01:35:59,820 --> 01:36:03,090
I try.
I tried recently briefly to find time to

1874
01:36:03,091 --> 01:36:04,920
go back and find the article.
But the way I,

1875
01:36:05,100 --> 01:36:09,870
here's how the story went down is uh,
the way I remember a detail that I

1876
01:36:09,871 --> 01:36:14,610
remember very clearly is that this guy,
it was his neighbor kid and they,

1877
01:36:14,611 --> 01:36:17,310
he had told this kid's parents,
they were going down the wash the

1878
01:36:17,311 --> 01:36:21,240
airplane and look at the airplane and he
decided to take the kid up for a flight.

1879
01:36:21,810 --> 01:36:22,860
I don't know if that's true or not.

1880
01:36:22,920 --> 01:36:25,620
I was trying to find that article to
confirm that aspect of it.

1881
01:36:25,621 --> 01:36:29,460
But I lived on a lake called Middle Lake
and everybody remembers for whatever

1882
01:36:29,461 --> 01:36:31,590
reason,
this guy balls our lake a couple times

1883
01:36:31,591 --> 01:36:35,600
really low.
There was a guy down on the east end of

1884
01:36:35,610 --> 01:36:39,810
the lake named Mr Rupert.
And I remember what was unusual about Mr

1885
01:36:39,900 --> 01:36:42,750
Rupert was he would eat freshwater
clams,

1886
01:36:42,930 --> 01:36:45,240
which we were forbidden from doing by
her dad.

1887
01:36:45,660 --> 01:36:48,090
But
you know,

1888
01:36:48,091 --> 01:36:49,920
it's just not as,
people don't regard it as a good

1889
01:36:49,921 --> 01:36:53,100
practice at all,
the freshwater clams because the toxins,

1890
01:36:53,300 --> 01:36:54,610
you know,
that's another thing I haven't really

1891
01:36:55,080 --> 01:36:57,410
looked into why that doesn't happen.
People just generally don't eat fresh

1892
01:36:57,411 --> 01:37:00,360
water clans.
But we would go get them and cleaned

1893
01:37:00,361 --> 01:37:01,260
them.
And I remember we cleaned a whole

1894
01:37:01,261 --> 01:37:02,490
shitload once.
So my dad's like,

1895
01:37:02,491 --> 01:37:04,830
no,
but Mr Rupert would eat these freshwater

1896
01:37:04,831 --> 01:37:05,664
clams.

1897
01:37:06,180 --> 01:37:08,100
And um,
what do you go raw already cook him.

1898
01:37:08,490 --> 01:37:11,100
I'm sure he would cook them.
He said,

1899
01:37:11,101 --> 01:37:14,700
man,
I saw that plane when a dove down over

1900
01:37:14,701 --> 01:37:15,690
the lake,
it went up,

1901
01:37:15,691 --> 01:37:18,150
but then dove down again and never came
back up.

1902
01:37:19,720 --> 01:37:24,720
And he even told some neighbors this.
The next day when we wake up,

1903
01:37:24,870 --> 01:37:29,040
uh,
the sheriff's possy the mounted like our

1904
01:37:29,041 --> 01:37:31,830
area had a,
mounted like a bunch of volunteers who

1905
01:37:31,831 --> 01:37:34,530
had horses and they were like the
mounted sheriff's Possy,

1906
01:37:35,070 --> 01:37:37,140
right?
Like deputized individuals during

1907
01:37:37,650 --> 01:37:42,330
emergencies such as this.
They were all loading up their horses to

1908
01:37:42,331 --> 01:37:46,800
head out into the woods to look for some
plain and another detail that was told

1909
01:37:46,801 --> 01:37:50,070
to me that I wanted to verify that would
I need to do.

1910
01:37:50,100 --> 01:37:53,490
I just need to go back and go through
the microfiche where I grew up in find

1911
01:37:53,491 --> 01:37:55,080
the article because it was something.

1912
01:37:55,320 --> 01:38:00,210
It had a signal on it and the signal was
picked up by some other country even,

1913
01:38:00,660 --> 01:38:03,600
but they knew that a plane had gone down
and that was a matter of fact.

1914
01:38:03,601 --> 01:38:05,730
Everyone at this point knew that this
plane had gone down

1915
01:38:07,710 --> 01:38:09,780
and we were riding around on our bikes
out in the woods.

1916
01:38:09,960 --> 01:38:12,270
Just kind of following the sheriff's
Posse guys.

1917
01:38:12,271 --> 01:38:15,870
Is there a sort of combing through the
woods and eventually a news helicopter

1918
01:38:16,140 --> 01:38:21,140
was hovering over a spot like right at
where a right.

1919
01:38:21,500 --> 01:38:26,430
We're at the end of white lake drive
and there was a news helicopter hovered

1920
01:38:26,431 --> 01:38:29,970
over there and my two brothers went
directly there on their bikes now as the

1921
01:38:29,971 --> 01:38:34,971
younger and if for some reason couldn't
get my mom and then we drove over and we

1922
01:38:35,101 --> 01:38:39,450
got to the end of White Lake Road.
We had to walk into the woods and there

1923
01:38:39,451 --> 01:38:44,451
was a guy there tried to block my mom
and me from going in there and always

1924
01:38:44,980 --> 01:38:45,260
married.

1925
01:38:45,260 --> 01:38:46,093
He said,
um,

1926
01:38:46,190 --> 01:38:47,490
uh,
if you could go in there,

1927
01:38:47,491 --> 01:38:50,010
you better have a strong stomach.
And she's like,

1928
01:38:50,011 --> 01:38:52,110
well,
my kids are in there and so we go in

1929
01:38:52,111 --> 01:38:55,260
there and Matt and Dan here to stand at
the edge of the hole there.

1930
01:38:55,710 --> 01:39:00,710
And they're trying to sort out the trend
to sort out who was who inside this

1931
01:39:01,921 --> 01:39:05,250
plane into bags.
I'm not shitting you,

1932
01:39:05,251 --> 01:39:07,350
man.
Like,

1933
01:39:07,500 --> 01:39:10,620
and yeah,
I have some visual details I remember

1934
01:39:10,621 --> 01:39:12,270
from that are just like,
uh,

1935
01:39:13,560 --> 01:39:16,700
yeah.
And then it's kind of a cop.

1936
01:39:16,710 --> 01:39:17,490
But yeah,
I would like,

1937
01:39:17,490 --> 01:39:19,180
like,
and then that was,

1938
01:39:19,210 --> 01:39:19,951
you know,
that.

1939
01:39:19,951 --> 01:39:22,170
And then I remember we were at our
neighbor,

1940
01:39:22,200 --> 01:39:24,550
Mrs Musselman,
um,

1941
01:39:25,440 --> 01:39:27,390
I remember we were at her birthday
party.

1942
01:39:27,440 --> 01:39:30,450
The cater just fell over dead in front
of everybody.

1943
01:39:31,680 --> 01:39:36,680
So like very non war related things.
Right.

1944
01:39:36,840 --> 01:39:39,160
That's what's interesting is saying
like,

1945
01:39:39,170 --> 01:39:41,650
but you can,
you can see that these are just happen

1946
01:39:41,730 --> 01:39:42,990
chance things.
But yeah,

1947
01:39:42,991 --> 01:39:47,280
you can go through life.
We just have sort of set up now or you

1948
01:39:47,281 --> 01:39:50,040
can be hidden from it.
But then you talked to previous

1949
01:39:50,041 --> 01:39:50,970
generations.
Just the,

1950
01:39:51,150 --> 01:39:51,661
like,
just,

1951
01:39:51,661 --> 01:39:53,320
it was just a part of stuff.
Yeah.

1952
01:39:53,860 --> 01:39:56,460
You know,
my old man talked about walking and he

1953
01:39:56,461 --> 01:39:58,740
grew up in Chicago.
He talked about walking out of a party

1954
01:39:58,741 --> 01:40:00,180
one time.
There's a dead guy at the bottom of the

1955
01:40:00,181 --> 01:40:03,390
stairs
that had been beaten to death,

1956
01:40:05,100 --> 01:40:06,340
just like Dave,
just like,

1957
01:40:07,200 --> 01:40:09,270
then went off to world war two and saw
who knows what.

1958
01:40:10,950 --> 01:40:13,500
So yeah,
when people talk about how now were so

1959
01:40:13,501 --> 01:40:15,690
violent shit,
there's nothing to support that.

1960
01:40:15,780 --> 01:40:16,531
Nothing.
No.

1961
01:40:16,531 --> 01:40:19,290
It's this safe.
The safest time to live ever used to be

1962
01:40:19,291 --> 01:40:21,510
able to hang people from trees and not
get in trouble for it.

1963
01:40:22,650 --> 01:40:24,970
If they're the right color.
Yeah.

1964
01:40:26,100 --> 01:40:27,600
Not that long ago.
No,

1965
01:40:28,050 --> 01:40:30,450
that's what's crazy about this wild bill
Hickok Shit.

1966
01:40:30,990 --> 01:40:32,360
We're talking about what?
18,

1967
01:40:32,390 --> 01:40:34,590
70 1880.
When was it?

1968
01:40:35,100 --> 01:40:37,050
And what's funny is he was one of the
combatants.

1969
01:40:37,170 --> 01:40:39,750
So some of those guys like wild bill
coding,

1970
01:40:39,751 --> 01:40:43,620
Wild Bill Hickok Hickock actually had
like a dispute over who got to have the

1971
01:40:43,621 --> 01:40:44,400
name,
you know,

1972
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:45,600
Bill Buffalo,
Bill cody,

1973
01:40:45,601 --> 01:40:48,060
wild bill Hickok.
There was some other wild bill's I

1974
01:40:48,061 --> 01:40:48,740
guess,
and it was like,

1975
01:40:48,740 --> 01:40:50,190
it was a popular name,
right?

1976
01:40:50,520 --> 01:40:55,030
But they were combatants tube.
So they engaged in these wars and the

1977
01:40:55,031 --> 01:40:57,820
fact that you would later get both sides
of the war.

1978
01:40:58,480 --> 01:41:03,480
It'd be like if you went and got a bunch
of Germans who were defending the

1979
01:41:04,931 --> 01:41:07,810
Normandy beach,
Omaha Beach,

1980
01:41:08,350 --> 01:41:10,030
and you've got a bunch of the,
um,

1981
01:41:10,480 --> 01:41:15,480
Americans who are starving Omaha beach
and you had a traveling road show in

1982
01:41:16,511 --> 01:41:21,511
which they would pretend to inflict mass
casualties on one another for paying

1983
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:28,720
adoring crowds.
How bizarre.

1984
01:41:28,721 --> 01:41:33,220
Who came up with the idea for that had
been done ever in history before?

1985
01:41:33,250 --> 01:41:35,080
I don't know.
My guess would be,

1986
01:41:35,170 --> 01:41:36,640
you know,
there's a guy that was the thing that

1987
01:41:36,641 --> 01:41:38,760
I've told people bunch of times no one
ever believes me to distribute.

1988
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:40,090
It's fucking true.
It's true.

1989
01:41:40,720 --> 01:41:43,210
There was a guy one time,
you know Niagara Falls,

1990
01:41:43,211 --> 01:41:44,290
right?
You've been to Niagara Falls.

1991
01:41:44,410 --> 01:41:46,800
No big damn waterfall.
Uh,

1992
01:41:47,400 --> 01:41:48,460
you know,
the St Louis,

1993
01:41:48,910 --> 01:41:52,690
St Lawrence drains the Great Lakes and
on its way out to the Atlanta,

1994
01:41:52,691 --> 01:41:54,190
it was a big ass waterfall.
Niagara Falls.

1995
01:41:54,490 --> 01:41:59,490
I'm a guy one time bought it.
There was like a zoo was liquidating its

1996
01:42:01,781 --> 01:42:06,781
holdings in a man.
Bought the zoo and bought a barge and

1997
01:42:09,041 --> 01:42:14,041
put all of the zoo animals on the barge
and charged a dollar to watch him send

1998
01:42:16,241 --> 01:42:18,700
his barge full of animals over the
falls.

1999
01:42:22,700 --> 01:42:23,533
Yeah.

2000
01:42:24,460 --> 01:42:25,540
Wow.
So,

2001
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:28,180
right.
Yeah.

2002
01:42:28,930 --> 01:42:32,930
Not that long ago.
Now I have no js nowadays.

2003
01:42:34,100 --> 01:42:36,680
Nowadays they'll put you in a cage.
Yeah.

2004
01:42:36,970 --> 01:42:38,170
So it's just.
Yeah.

2005
01:42:38,171 --> 01:42:40,420
We've traveled.
What is this,

2006
01:42:40,421 --> 01:42:41,254
Jamie?

2007
01:42:41,610 --> 01:42:42,500
From the,
when the,

2008
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:44,630
when the show started in the world's
fair,

2009
01:42:45,170 --> 01:42:50,050
he got denied from uh,
doing the show outside of the world is

2010
01:42:50,670 --> 01:42:53,050
fairly not talking to Weymouth,
cody.

2011
01:42:53,051 --> 01:42:55,400
So I don't know which one is which,
but uh,

2012
01:42:55,700 --> 01:43:00,650
he found a 14 acre,
a swath of land where you set up stands

2013
01:43:00,651 --> 01:43:05,210
for 18,000 people to watch each show and
over 2 million people saw it during like

2014
01:43:05,300 --> 01:43:05,900
that,
whatever,

2015
01:43:05,900 --> 01:43:09,380
during the world's fair that year was
the first one.

2016
01:43:09,381 --> 01:43:09,530
Yeah.

2017
01:43:09,530 --> 01:43:11,040
And there weren't even,
uh,

2018
01:43:11,910 --> 01:43:13,910
there,
there were 2 million salt,

2019
01:43:13,911 --> 01:43:17,720
but there were less,
well under probably way less than $75.

2020
01:43:17,730 --> 01:43:19,280
Million people in the country.
Wow.

2021
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:21,950
Wow.
What year was it in World War Two?

2022
01:43:21,951 --> 01:43:24,650
There were $150 million.
That's incredible.

2023
01:43:25,400 --> 01:43:28,970
18,000 spectators.
Seventy four Indians from the Pine Ridge

2024
01:43:28,971 --> 01:43:31,700
reservation in South Dakota.
Wow.

2025
01:43:31,730 --> 01:43:34,760
18,000 spectators must have been amazing
back then.

2026
01:43:34,910 --> 01:43:35,320
Yeah.
Now.

2027
01:43:35,320 --> 01:43:37,670
But here.
But think about the numbers at that

2028
01:43:37,671 --> 01:43:41,780
battle that they.
Historians feel that at that battle,

2029
01:43:41,781 --> 01:43:46,781
that was the largest gathering of plains
Indians to have ever occurred.

2030
01:43:48,760 --> 01:43:52,130
An encampment of maybe 10,000.
And

2031
01:43:52,130 --> 01:43:56,270
how many people were there from?
What's his face?

2032
01:43:56,300 --> 01:43:59,150
Costa Costa.
He wrote in to one end of the camp.

2033
01:43:59,980 --> 01:44:03,710
That's why it's not well understood.
Like there were other engagements going

2034
01:44:03,711 --> 01:44:07,460
on at the same time once when you say
like coster his command was annihilated.

2035
01:44:08,120 --> 01:44:12,530
There were other prongs to the attack
that were repelled and beaten,

2036
01:44:12,770 --> 01:44:16,790
but it was only like one prong of the
attack that had cost her and that was an

2037
01:44:16,791 --> 01:44:21,791
isolated and how many people do you have
when you rode in with about 200 people

2038
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:26,360
and ran into a,
an encampment of 10,000 individuals and

2039
01:44:26,361 --> 01:44:30,260
later some of these individuals like
gall and others in interviews said that

2040
01:44:30,290 --> 01:44:33,890
even at the time,
our understanding is that these people

2041
01:44:33,891 --> 01:44:36,830
were all hopelessly drunk.
Oh my God.

2042
01:44:36,860 --> 01:44:38,660
Because it did not make sense what they
were doing.

2043
01:44:40,010 --> 01:44:41,570
Wow.
They just didn't know.

2044
01:44:41,690 --> 01:44:43,820
It's no one understood that.
That's why custard,

2045
01:44:43,850 --> 01:44:47,480
that's why there's still all these costs
are people who just debate and argue and

2046
01:44:47,900 --> 01:44:49,850
is like,
uh,

2047
01:44:50,180 --> 01:44:52,260
some of his crow scouts.
Okay.

2048
01:44:52,340 --> 01:44:57,340
He had some cree or re scouts and cro
scouts who came and told him do not.

2049
01:44:59,150 --> 01:45:01,770
You cannot go down there in the morning
there's,

2050
01:45:01,780 --> 01:45:04,700
we were playing was attack at daybreak
and they said,

2051
01:45:04,701 --> 01:45:07,580
you cannot do that.
That makes no sense.

2052
01:45:07,610 --> 01:45:11,390
He said we're going,
they did their death songs,

2053
01:45:11,450 --> 01:45:14,000
some of the,
some of his scout sang their death songs

2054
01:45:14,001 --> 01:45:16,310
because they knew what they would be
dying in the morning.

2055
01:45:17,030 --> 01:45:18,680
And um,
it's debated.

2056
01:45:18,681 --> 01:45:21,230
So today,
to what extent did he,

2057
01:45:21,231 --> 01:45:22,064
like,

2058
01:45:23,490 --> 01:45:25,500
did he believe what his scouts are
telling them?

2059
01:45:26,640 --> 01:45:28,730
Okay.
So was it suicide or was it huge?

2060
01:45:28,790 --> 01:45:32,160
No one thinks that was suicidal.
It was either that he just didn't really

2061
01:45:32,161 --> 01:45:36,300
comprehend what they were telling him or
he was so,

2062
01:45:37,380 --> 01:45:40,680
you know,
he was a decorated civil war figure and

2063
01:45:40,681 --> 01:45:45,681
probably was a very ardent believer in
the superiority like of his army.

2064
01:45:46,231 --> 01:45:50,670
And they were trained soldiers with
discipline that there was just one prong

2065
01:45:50,671 --> 01:45:51,920
of a three year,
you know,

2066
01:45:52,020 --> 01:45:54,150
a three prong attack or two pronged
attack.

2067
01:45:54,380 --> 01:45:56,040
He was riding in the one end of the
village,

2068
01:45:56,310 --> 01:46:00,570
but he does a road into the village and
they were just killed.

2069
01:46:01,110 --> 01:46:02,390
Right.
And in independent,

2070
01:46:02,410 --> 01:46:04,410
in popular depictions,
they always show cost her,

2071
01:46:04,411 --> 01:46:06,330
like his,
the last guy standing like there's a

2072
01:46:06,331 --> 01:46:09,080
mountain of his dead guys around them,
you know,

2073
01:46:09,090 --> 01:46:13,350
and he's still firing his revolver a
with long hair and when in fact he had

2074
01:46:13,351 --> 01:46:14,250
short hair at the time.

2075
01:46:14,550 --> 01:46:18,360
But uh,
some people think that in looking at it,

2076
01:46:18,361 --> 01:46:20,190
he probably.
Yeah.

2077
01:46:20,220 --> 01:46:22,860
The great one is here.
Fell coster.

2078
01:46:24,220 --> 01:46:25,160
Oh,
great image.

2079
01:46:25,580 --> 01:46:28,280
Yeah.
Jamie just pulled up a crazy picture.

2080
01:46:28,580 --> 01:46:31,590
So here fell costs and contemporary
picture did say what?

2081
01:46:31,710 --> 01:46:32,001
No,
no.

2082
01:46:32,001 --> 01:46:34,850
That's the old classic.
There's one that was on the anheuser

2083
01:46:34,851 --> 01:46:37,460
busch to the time.
Yeah.

2084
01:46:37,461 --> 01:46:40,580
Here fell was a little bit later.
But then I'm the one that was the.

2085
01:46:40,581 --> 01:46:43,340
Anheuser Busch won was by a German guy,
I think that was the one you had pulled

2086
01:46:43,341 --> 01:46:46,280
up that was like desert Bush had.
It was like their poster.

2087
01:46:46,430 --> 01:46:49,280
Oh my God,
that's your fail coster wow.

2088
01:46:49,470 --> 01:46:50,220
Which is

2089
01:46:50,220 --> 01:46:54,120
considered to be a very accurate.
Was considered to be a pretty accurate

2090
01:46:54,720 --> 01:46:57,300
depiction of what was going on.
Now the

2091
01:46:59,310 --> 01:47:01,980
custer died early.
I think he died earlier in the skirt,

2092
01:47:01,981 --> 01:47:05,700
but she wasn't like the movies.
He's got the flowing blonde hair.

2093
01:47:05,730 --> 01:47:07,800
Everyone's dead and he's still firing
away.

2094
01:47:07,950 --> 01:47:11,310
Of course he was.
He was probably killed earlier rather

2095
01:47:11,311 --> 01:47:14,790
than later in the skirmish.
It's so funny because you're right there

2096
01:47:14,791 --> 01:47:15,920
like he's like,
you know,

2097
01:47:16,890 --> 01:47:21,110
in a different position.
It's so funny that,

2098
01:47:21,111 --> 01:47:22,940
that we've done that,
you know,

2099
01:47:22,941 --> 01:47:26,950
that people have taken what they know
most likely we're a storage really

2100
01:47:26,960 --> 01:47:30,410
inaccurate accounts and they pass them
down generation to generation.

2101
01:47:30,411 --> 01:47:33,560
And it makes you wonder like,
this is what we know now because this is

2102
01:47:33,561 --> 01:47:36,320
only a hundred or so years ago.
Like what,

2103
01:47:36,710 --> 01:47:39,920
what are we getting when we're getting
some version of something that happened

2104
01:47:39,921 --> 01:47:41,870
a thousand years ago or thousand years
ago?

2105
01:47:41,900 --> 01:47:43,490
You know,
how distorted

2106
01:47:44,390 --> 01:47:45,620
insanely.
Yeah.

2107
01:47:45,950 --> 01:47:50,150
But the problem we have as a culture I
think is when someone goes to fix,

2108
01:47:51,880 --> 01:47:56,380
when someone goes to challenge our
popular perceptions,

2109
01:47:56,790 --> 01:47:59,020
um,
it's,

2110
01:47:59,080 --> 01:48:02,980
it's branded as revisionist and somehow
like loses,

2111
01:48:04,210 --> 01:48:06,460
right?
It becomes almost like a,

2112
01:48:06,461 --> 01:48:09,170
it's credentials or tarnished.
Do.

2113
01:48:09,190 --> 01:48:11,020
Remember the guy,
I can't remember what politician,

2114
01:48:11,021 --> 01:48:11,860
Jamie,
we'll pull it up.

2115
01:48:11,861 --> 01:48:13,370
There was a politician who said,
um,

2116
01:48:13,870 --> 01:48:15,930
he famously said,
you know,

2117
01:48:15,950 --> 01:48:19,100
her,
we realized that Paul revere the,

2118
01:48:19,220 --> 01:48:20,940
the,
the ride of Paul revere was,

2119
01:48:20,990 --> 01:48:23,290
didn't really happen like fabricated
from whole cloth.

2120
01:48:23,291 --> 01:48:23,860
Right?
Right.

2121
01:48:23,860 --> 01:48:25,900
There was a politician said,
I love Paul Revere.

2122
01:48:25,901 --> 01:48:26,980
Whether he wrote or not.

2123
01:48:30,090 --> 01:48:30,631
Well,
I mean,

2124
01:48:30,631 --> 01:48:32,490
when we were kids,
we were taught Columbus,

2125
01:48:32,491 --> 01:48:33,700
discovered the United States.
Yeah.

2126
01:48:33,960 --> 01:48:35,700
I mean,
we didn't figure that out until.

2127
01:48:35,710 --> 01:48:38,790
It's still amazing that it wasn't like
the West indies.

2128
01:48:39,230 --> 01:48:42,270
And to this day it's still amazing that
they celebrate that guy when you find

2129
01:48:42,271 --> 01:48:44,180
out that he was a fucking monster.
I mean,

2130
01:48:44,280 --> 01:48:45,390
the,
what was it?

2131
01:48:45,391 --> 01:48:47,280
Uh,
I believe it was a,

2132
01:48:47,281 --> 01:48:52,110
I'm a minister or someone who has some
religious person who came with them at

2133
01:48:52,111 --> 01:48:53,130
the time,
uh,

2134
01:48:53,150 --> 01:48:57,660
left a journal about the atrocities
committed directly by Columbus and his

2135
01:48:57,700 --> 01:49:01,410
men when they hacked off arms for
people,

2136
01:49:01,411 --> 01:49:02,700
couldn't bring them back.
Gold.

2137
01:49:02,701 --> 01:49:04,320
And I mean,
just horrific shit.

2138
01:49:04,321 --> 01:49:06,600
Smash babies on rocks did it right in
front of them.

2139
01:49:06,810 --> 01:49:10,230
And this guy was a firsthand account of
what we're supposed to believe.

2140
01:49:10,770 --> 01:49:13,320
I mean,
who knows how much of what he's saying

2141
01:49:13,321 --> 01:49:15,510
is accurate,
but if any of it is accurate,

2142
01:49:15,810 --> 01:49:17,440
Columbus was a fucking monster.
Yeah.

2143
01:49:17,590 --> 01:49:20,800
I think there,
what it stems from is that from the

2144
01:49:20,801 --> 01:49:25,630
perspective in Europe at the time he
had,

2145
01:49:27,830 --> 01:49:31,190
he had solidified and put some shit
together that people had been kind of

2146
01:49:31,250 --> 01:49:32,890
pecking around the edges of.
Right.

2147
01:49:33,560 --> 01:49:35,690
Whether it's continental existed.
Yeah.

2148
01:49:35,691 --> 01:49:36,041
And,
and,

2149
01:49:36,041 --> 01:49:37,140
and,
and yeah,

2150
01:49:37,190 --> 01:49:40,400
just had,
it was like a leap forward at the time.

2151
01:49:40,580 --> 01:49:42,170
Yeah.
How crazy is that?

2152
01:49:42,200 --> 01:49:46,390
But the fact that it becomes that,
right?

2153
01:49:47,050 --> 01:49:50,140
Did he like,
you know that in some people's minds,

2154
01:49:50,400 --> 01:49:53,290
like somehow established America.
Yeah.

2155
01:49:53,770 --> 01:49:55,510
And that we take a day off of school
because of it.

2156
01:49:55,960 --> 01:49:57,490
It's really crazy.
It's bizarre.

2157
01:49:57,550 --> 01:50:01,240
Columbus Day.
I mean we still to this day it's 2017

2158
01:50:01,270 --> 01:50:02,860
kids get Columbus Day off,
don't they?

2159
01:50:02,920 --> 01:50:05,050
But now it's like,
here's the thing,

2160
01:50:05,440 --> 01:50:10,440
now that no one,
now that now that sort of the consensus,

2161
01:50:11,141 --> 01:50:13,660
right,
the popular consensus is that,

2162
01:50:14,240 --> 01:50:19,240
um,
he was a one of many players involved in

2163
01:50:20,591 --> 01:50:25,591
sort of putting together what was here
and sort of outlining where it was and

2164
01:50:26,500 --> 01:50:28,260
how to get here.
Um,

2165
01:50:28,710 --> 01:50:31,860
he was one of a bunch of players,
you know,

2166
01:50:32,140 --> 01:50:34,510
almost certainly not the first,
uh,

2167
01:50:35,200 --> 01:50:37,940
no one cares about that.
Meaning what they mean is you're like

2168
01:50:38,020 --> 01:50:43,020
saying like,
I uphold the idea of western

2169
01:50:44,621 --> 01:50:48,820
civilizations,
annexation of the new world as being a

2170
01:50:48,821 --> 01:50:49,654
good thing.

2171
01:50:51,340 --> 01:50:54,940
So when someone says,
when someone gets pissed at the

2172
01:50:54,941 --> 01:50:58,480
revisionists for questioning the
legitimacy of Columbus,

2173
01:50:58,630 --> 01:51:02,140
they're not actually talking about what
he specifically did.

2174
01:51:02,200 --> 01:51:07,200
It's become,
it's become a proxy for the cultural

2175
01:51:07,571 --> 01:51:10,120
annexation of the new world and to say,
oh,

2176
01:51:10,121 --> 01:51:11,740
I hate Columbus.
He's an asshole.

2177
01:51:12,190 --> 01:51:14,350
They take it to me and you're saying
that,

2178
01:51:14,351 --> 01:51:15,970
um,
that,

2179
01:51:15,971 --> 01:51:19,120
uh,
you're questioning our claim on the

2180
01:51:19,121 --> 01:51:20,860
western hemisphere and that it was a bad
thing.

2181
01:51:21,130 --> 01:51:23,110
I think that's why people are annoyed by
it.

2182
01:51:24,190 --> 01:51:26,950
I don't think people were too much
annoyed by it anymore because the thing

2183
01:51:26,951 --> 01:51:28,210
that's pretty much been established
there.

2184
01:51:28,211 --> 01:51:31,480
Columbus is a really bad,
but no one's gone in and undid the day

2185
01:51:31,490 --> 01:51:32,323
have.
Have they.

2186
01:51:32,380 --> 01:51:35,020
Is there any.
Is there any kind of change them around,

2187
01:51:35,021 --> 01:51:35,711
don't they?
Well,

2188
01:51:35,711 --> 01:51:37,510
they should probably come up with
another name for it.

2189
01:51:38,270 --> 01:51:40,890
You know,
a Api a.

2190
01:51:42,290 --> 01:51:43,450
it's still a day,
right?

2191
01:51:43,451 --> 01:51:44,800
I think so.
Pretty sure.

2192
01:51:45,370 --> 01:51:47,350
Yeah.
It is kinda crazy though.

2193
01:51:47,380 --> 01:51:49,930
I'm not,
I'm not here to defend the day,

2194
01:51:49,931 --> 01:51:52,740
but I do understand that kind of how
that shit came to beat.

2195
01:51:52,750 --> 01:51:53,583
Yeah,
I understand it.

2196
01:51:53,800 --> 01:51:57,580
It just seems pretty incredible that
just 500 years ago here it goes to war

2197
01:51:57,581 --> 01:51:59,200
against Columbus Day and the Washington
Post.

2198
01:51:59,320 --> 01:52:00,970
Yes.
It's waged by the same people who were

2199
01:52:00,971 --> 01:52:04,080
waging a war against Christmas.
His is really.

2200
01:52:06,410 --> 01:52:10,540
That's crazy.
Indigenous People's Day in favor of

2201
01:52:10,541 --> 01:52:11,730
indigenous peoples.
Yeah.

2202
01:52:12,040 --> 01:52:13,120
No,
it makes sense.

2203
01:52:14,650 --> 01:52:16,000
Give us a day off.
We'll take it.

2204
01:52:16,210 --> 01:52:20,290
I'm generally like little movements,
like little cultural movements like

2205
01:52:20,291 --> 01:52:23,080
that.
I'm generally not a receptive.

2206
01:52:23,081 --> 01:52:25,000
I don't know.
I don't try to read too much into them.

2207
01:52:25,450 --> 01:52:27,840
If I woke up tomorrow and telling me
that we had decided,

2208
01:52:27,850 --> 01:52:31,270
you know,
that people got together and decided

2209
01:52:31,271 --> 01:52:33,460
against Columbus Day,
I wouldn't like do a lot of soul

2210
01:52:33,461 --> 01:52:36,670
searching on that.
Well,

2211
01:52:36,671 --> 01:52:38,260
you know,
you don't work a traditional job

2212
01:52:38,261 --> 01:52:40,180
anywhere or go to school where you take
that day.

2213
01:52:40,181 --> 01:52:42,070
Oh yeah.
I think people that lost the day,

2214
01:52:42,071 --> 01:52:43,150
they're like too.
That's my day,

2215
01:52:43,151 --> 01:52:43,871
man.
Yeah.

2216
01:52:43,871 --> 01:52:47,330
It's just hard to imagine as I hit
walleyes my buddy doug every year.

2217
01:52:47,720 --> 01:52:48,553
Yeah,
you'd be bumped.

2218
01:52:48,740 --> 01:52:50,990
It's just hard to imagine that,
you know,

2219
01:52:51,020 --> 01:52:56,020
500 plus years ago they really didn't
know in Europe about the continental

2220
01:52:56,270 --> 01:52:57,460
United States.
I,

2221
01:52:57,480 --> 01:52:58,910
that's,
that's amazing.

2222
01:53:00,230 --> 01:53:02,730
Yeah.
We were talking about earlier talking

2223
01:53:02,740 --> 01:53:07,010
about violence or violent,
more violent than I think that we're so

2224
01:53:07,011 --> 01:53:12,011
tripped up by the upheaval caused by the
digital age.

2225
01:53:13,280 --> 01:53:14,930
Right.
And everything.

2226
01:53:14,931 --> 01:53:15,471
Like,
you know,

2227
01:53:15,471 --> 01:53:18,590
I just changed our sleep practices and
just everything.

2228
01:53:19,090 --> 01:53:20,660
You know,
it's a major upheaval.

2229
01:53:20,830 --> 01:53:25,670
Yeah.
But picture that picture that in your

2230
01:53:25,671 --> 01:53:28,100
lifetime,
they all like,

2231
01:53:28,550 --> 01:53:30,050
you become aware

2232
01:53:31,610 --> 01:53:32,443
that

2233
01:53:33,250 --> 01:53:33,760
the,
the,

2234
01:53:33,760 --> 01:53:37,100
the earth did see that there are,

2235
01:53:37,690 --> 01:53:40,570
you know,
three times as many or whatever as many

2236
01:53:40,571 --> 01:53:43,000
civilizations on earth is that you
thought there were.

2237
01:53:44,860 --> 01:53:48,700
Yeah.
I mean that's a huge thing to grapple

2238
01:53:48,701 --> 01:53:49,320
with

2239
01:53:49,320 --> 01:53:51,900
a huge thing to grapple with.
People that had history,

2240
01:53:52,170 --> 01:53:55,230
people that had boats,
they were seafaring had more history

2241
01:53:55,231 --> 01:53:56,070
than you.
Yeah.

2242
01:53:56,160 --> 01:53:57,420
It's crazy.

2243
01:53:57,720 --> 01:54:00,810
Or to think that one day,
and this is not too long ago,

2244
01:54:01,290 --> 01:54:03,540
so you know,
some of our grandparents remember this,

2245
01:54:03,630 --> 01:54:08,630
to think that one day we had devised the
contraption that was capable of ending

2246
01:54:11,181 --> 01:54:16,010
life on earth and that these
contraptions could be initiated by the

2247
01:54:16,011 --> 01:54:17,870
distant actions of a handful of people

2248
01:54:19,890 --> 01:54:20,520
that

2249
01:54:20,520 --> 01:54:23,340
that's a change,
right?

2250
01:54:23,400 --> 01:54:25,710
Yeah.
The nuclear era.

2251
01:54:25,800 --> 01:54:27,840
Here's the craziest change in the
nuclear era,

2252
01:54:27,930 --> 01:54:31,830
from the invention of an airplane to
someone dropping a nuclear bomb from an

2253
01:54:31,831 --> 01:54:35,910
airplane is less than 50 years now.
I think Wright brothers 19.

2254
01:54:35,911 --> 01:54:36,181
Oh,
three,

2255
01:54:36,181 --> 01:54:36,800
right?
Nineteen,

2256
01:54:36,800 --> 01:54:37,760
six,
93,

2257
01:54:37,980 --> 01:54:40,560
early 1900.
[inaudible] sustained a flight with a

2258
01:54:40,561 --> 01:54:45,450
heavier than air vehicle.
And then in 1945 they dropped an atomic

2259
01:54:45,451 --> 01:54:46,710
bomb.
That's crazy.

2260
01:54:46,740 --> 01:54:48,900
That's inside my life.
Someone was like,

2261
01:54:48,901 --> 01:54:50,760
I knew this airplane shit was going to
take off,

2262
01:54:52,680 --> 01:54:57,680
but that is probably one of the biggest
changes ever in terms of like the amount

2263
01:54:57,721 --> 01:55:02,721
of in 50 years in the world to go from
no air travel at all to dropping a

2264
01:55:03,481 --> 01:55:07,530
nuclear bomb out of an airplane in less
than 50 years.

2265
01:55:07,531 --> 01:55:07,810
Yeah.

2266
01:55:07,810 --> 01:55:10,030
And to then have it be that it's a
staple of,

2267
01:55:10,031 --> 01:55:10,810
uh,
of,

2268
01:55:10,810 --> 01:55:12,520
of,
of American life,

2269
01:55:12,560 --> 01:55:15,340
they did not just with other people like
space travel.

2270
01:55:15,730 --> 01:55:16,541
You're like,
okay,

2271
01:55:16,541 --> 01:55:20,470
it's this flood of information,
but it's not affect me.

2272
01:55:20,471 --> 01:55:23,320
But with that,
it's like that's now how you get around.

2273
01:55:23,830 --> 01:55:24,940
Yeah.
You know,

2274
01:55:25,060 --> 01:55:29,020
that you like at a time when you wanted
to cross the country,

2275
01:55:29,950 --> 01:55:33,310
you would lose a large percentage of
your party to death.

2276
01:55:33,370 --> 01:55:35,320
Right.
You had to plan ahead who would take

2277
01:55:35,321 --> 01:55:37,570
many,
many months to being just a thing.

2278
01:55:37,571 --> 01:55:42,571
You just do on a whim.
Now I do believe like I accept that we

2279
01:55:42,641 --> 01:55:46,560
are a state of upheaval right now and I
think there were probably impacting

2280
01:55:46,561 --> 01:55:50,280
ourselves in ways we don't fully
understand how so digital devices.

2281
01:55:50,580 --> 01:55:51,413
Oh,
for sure.

2282
01:55:51,420 --> 01:55:53,070
Yeah.
Just how you run your day.

2283
01:55:53,520 --> 01:55:54,150
Yeah,
no doubt.

2284
01:55:54,150 --> 01:55:56,190
How you spend your time,
how you run your day will ever go to a

2285
01:55:56,191 --> 01:55:58,890
restaurant and you see a whole group of
people just staring at their phone.

2286
01:55:59,100 --> 01:56:00,190
Yeah.
Yeah.

2287
01:56:00,220 --> 01:56:02,520
We're laughing with their day.
If you're staying at the baggage claim,

2288
01:56:02,550 --> 01:56:04,210
not looking at your phone,
people will think you're nuts.

2289
01:56:05,420 --> 01:56:08,790
It's true.
My friend is looking around trying to

2290
01:56:08,791 --> 01:56:09,930
make conversation with people.

2291
01:56:09,970 --> 01:56:11,400
My friend,
a conversation.

2292
01:56:11,460 --> 01:56:15,270
His life has happened with some over.
So I was in starbucks drink and a coffee

2293
01:56:15,280 --> 01:56:17,890
just sitting there and staring at the
wall like a fucking lunatic.

2294
01:56:23,420 --> 01:56:24,850
What,
what are they out to you?

2295
01:56:24,851 --> 01:56:27,040
They're going to start killing people.
They're not doing anything with their

2296
01:56:27,041 --> 01:56:28,060
phone.
Um,

2297
01:56:28,570 --> 01:56:30,070
it,
it's a big thing.

2298
01:56:30,071 --> 01:56:33,460
But what are the helpful thing?
I guess one of the help it just bring it

2299
01:56:33,461 --> 01:56:35,590
full circle.
One of the helpful things

2300
01:56:38,380 --> 01:56:41,530
you know about traveling or about like
just reading about history is you stop,

2301
01:56:41,560 --> 01:56:46,560
you lose some of that sense of
specialness about thinking that the life

2302
01:56:47,231 --> 01:56:49,210
you're living in,
the moment you're living it as this

2303
01:56:49,211 --> 01:56:52,920
great test of humanity or some like
super peculiar thing going out when you

2304
01:56:52,921 --> 01:56:56,170
realize that people have always been
involved with and struggle with

2305
01:56:56,171 --> 01:56:59,660
cataclysmic upheaval,
you know,

2306
01:56:59,770 --> 01:57:04,770
and then to go in to indigo witness some
other people in some version of that

2307
01:57:05,981 --> 01:57:09,820
transition
is pretty healthy man.

2308
01:57:10,810 --> 01:57:12,730
Maybe in the long term,
let's just traveling,

2309
01:57:12,760 --> 01:57:15,520
going to see how other people do stuff.
It's unsettling,

2310
01:57:15,521 --> 01:57:16,690
but probably ultimately pretty.
Yeah.

2311
01:57:16,750 --> 01:57:17,950
Good for you.
Yeah,

2312
01:57:17,951 --> 01:57:20,890
I think it's very good for you.
Just anything that enhances perspective,

2313
01:57:20,891 --> 01:57:24,820
it gives you like another layer that you
could consider when you think about life

2314
01:57:24,821 --> 01:57:27,610
on earth.
We're so used to our own environment,

2315
01:57:27,850 --> 01:57:30,910
our own ways.
It's like you were talking about talking

2316
01:57:30,911 --> 01:57:35,740
to these people and asking them like,
why don't you eat monkeys and now we're

2317
01:57:35,750 --> 01:57:38,470
stony monkeys have.
Has He ever been to a supermarket?

2318
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:43,330
That's a good question.
A couple of years ago when I was

2319
01:57:43,331 --> 01:57:45,670
mentioning that I had mentioned to you
that,

2320
01:57:46,300 --> 01:57:47,380
that the,
the,

2321
01:57:47,740 --> 01:57:50,110
the,
that a couple of American companies who

2322
01:57:50,111 --> 01:57:53,800
have a to have like some conservation
spending,

2323
01:57:53,801 --> 01:57:56,860
they do,
they were training some guys from real

2324
01:57:56,900 --> 01:58:00,010
village.
They were training some of them to,

2325
01:58:00,460 --> 01:58:04,300
uh,
just how to interface with Westerners.

2326
01:58:04,630 --> 01:58:07,600
And as part of that,
he went up to,

2327
01:58:07,601 --> 01:58:12,601
he might have even gone up to the
Bahamas to go for a couple days to a fly

2328
01:58:12,670 --> 01:58:14,740
fishing lodge.
So I'm getting.

2329
01:58:14,790 --> 01:58:16,540
So yeah,
he flew on a commercial aircraft.

2330
01:58:16,600 --> 01:58:17,610
Oh Wow.
Yeah.

2331
01:58:18,280 --> 01:58:22,180
I'm just so pleased to see.
But he's peculiar in that way now I've

2332
01:58:22,181 --> 01:58:24,310
brought up to him.
I'm trying to talk him into coming up

2333
01:58:24,311 --> 01:58:26,500
and going.
I want to take them on ice fishing trip

2334
01:58:26,770 --> 01:58:31,770
so I'll take loads your Alaska fish to
the ice because what I want him to

2335
01:58:32,591 --> 01:58:33,990
understand is,
um,

2336
01:58:35,030 --> 01:58:40,030
I'm so uncomfortable
with him physically uncomfortable with

2337
01:58:40,610 --> 01:58:42,160
the,
with

2338
01:58:42,160 --> 01:58:45,280
everything biting me all the time,
just everything.

2339
01:58:45,281 --> 01:58:48,190
It's just extremely uncomfortable.
And to him at standard,

2340
01:58:48,510 --> 01:58:49,151
yeah,
it's comfortable,

2341
01:58:49,151 --> 01:58:52,930
but he's never like if he hadn't done
that trip or you know,

2342
01:58:53,180 --> 01:58:55,590
or just all of his siblings and most
other people's village,

2343
01:58:55,591 --> 01:58:56,620
they never experienced,
you know,

2344
01:58:56,621 --> 01:58:58,600
they never experienced 50 degrees
Fahrenheit.

2345
01:58:58,810 --> 01:59:01,750
Now what is it like to them when it
comes to bugs so they have any sort of

2346
01:59:01,751 --> 01:59:04,300
resistance to mosquitoes or anything
along those lines.

2347
01:59:05,260 --> 01:59:07,420
They don't care about it nearly as much
as we care about it.

2348
01:59:07,450 --> 01:59:09,080
Do they get the same amount of bytes
though too?

2349
01:59:09,081 --> 01:59:12,040
They get chewed up like we do.
They complain about tick bites and

2350
01:59:12,041 --> 01:59:14,260
stuff,
but generally it doesn't seem to bother

2351
01:59:14,261 --> 01:59:15,880
me like we do because it's just a part
of everyday life.

2352
01:59:16,200 --> 01:59:18,060
But you got to get used to,
you know,

2353
01:59:18,061 --> 01:59:20,140
and like and like hanging out in
Bolivia.

2354
01:59:20,320 --> 01:59:25,320
You get bit by bees and wasps at about
the same rate that you'd get bit by

2355
01:59:28,991 --> 01:59:32,980
mosquitoes if you rat like some fourth
of July thing out at your uncle's pond,

2356
01:59:32,981 --> 01:59:35,170
you know,
shooting fireworks off at night on the

2357
01:59:35,171 --> 01:59:38,170
edge of a cat tail.
Marsh was like your skin a bit just like

2358
01:59:38,171 --> 01:59:41,290
wake up and you start getting bit by
bees and wasps so they just get,

2359
01:59:41,350 --> 01:59:44,110
just kind of used to it and then you'd
say like,

2360
01:59:44,111 --> 01:59:46,390
I remember when I got stung by a bullet
and asking like,

2361
01:59:46,391 --> 01:59:47,390
Hey,
how many times you been stung by a

2362
01:59:47,391 --> 01:59:51,130
bullet dance and love them and be like,
I couldn't even begin to guess how many

2363
01:59:51,131 --> 01:59:53,680
times I've been stung by a bullet dance,
but it's like,

2364
01:59:53,681 --> 01:59:56,140
but they just suffer different.
So what I want to do is I want him to

2365
01:59:56,141 --> 02:00:01,120
experience suffering
while watching me not suffer.

2366
02:00:02,800 --> 02:00:07,020
So like I want him to look at me with
all.

2367
02:00:08,240 --> 02:00:11,830
Okay.
And so to do this I want them to come up

2368
02:00:11,831 --> 02:00:14,110
and ice fish wrong and take them up.
And I got A.

2369
02:00:14,170 --> 02:00:17,800
I got a friend who likes to go on.
He likes to get on snow machines in

2370
02:00:17,801 --> 02:00:22,801
February or March out of fair banks.
And they go overnight camping on snow

2371
02:00:24,271 --> 02:00:27,850
machines,
fishing through the ice for Bourbon

2372
02:00:27,850 --> 02:00:29,010
Bourbon.
Oh,

2373
02:00:29,020 --> 02:00:31,100
for a cold.
Freshwater links are low.

2374
02:00:31,140 --> 02:00:33,490
You know,
why they call lawyers is when you got a

2375
02:00:33,530 --> 02:00:35,080
bourbon,
his Ah,

2376
02:00:35,500 --> 02:00:40,370
his heart sway back next to his asshole.
So they call them lawyers or vent,

2377
02:00:40,950 --> 02:00:42,070
you know,
fish have a,

2378
02:00:42,990 --> 02:00:44,830
like a,
like a color awake and they have a uni

2379
02:00:44,831 --> 02:00:45,930
whole,
you know,

2380
02:00:45,940 --> 02:00:47,590
we have like a bird.
Yeah.

2381
02:00:47,591 --> 02:00:52,591
We have a couple outlets and they have a
single outlet for waste and sexual

2382
02:00:53,290 --> 02:00:54,840
exchange.
Um,

2383
02:00:55,270 --> 02:00:56,460
so yeah,
lawyer,

2384
02:00:56,470 --> 02:00:57,580
Bourbon,
fresh water,

2385
02:00:57,581 --> 02:00:57,910
laying.

2386
02:00:57,910 --> 02:01:00,040
Poor man's lobster is another word for
it.

2387
02:01:00,070 --> 02:01:03,760
So northern fish,
it looks like if you combined a snake

2388
02:01:03,761 --> 02:01:06,820
and a bull frog kind of A.
Yeah,

2389
02:01:06,821 --> 02:01:10,060
I want to take them out to camp in a
tent in 40 degree below weather right

2390
02:01:10,061 --> 02:01:10,571
there.
Wow.

2391
02:01:10,571 --> 02:01:13,600
What a cool looking fish are very good
to eat.

2392
02:01:13,750 --> 02:01:14,860
Yeah.
Very good.

2393
02:01:15,490 --> 02:01:17,800
Wow.
Now they commonly caught through the ice

2394
02:01:17,801 --> 02:01:19,320
or did people catch them on the street?
That looks.

2395
02:01:19,340 --> 02:01:20,600
That's a northern peasant.
Dorothy?

2396
02:01:20,770 --> 02:01:22,150
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

2397
02:01:22,151 --> 02:01:23,560
No,
it's kind of a bourbon or not.

2398
02:01:24,130 --> 02:01:26,560
But in the Great Lakes there.
Alaska.

2399
02:01:26,570 --> 02:01:27,790
Yeah.
There's bourbon everywhere.

2400
02:01:27,791 --> 02:01:30,900
So does it tastes like lobster?
Is that why they call it a poor milk?

2401
02:01:31,030 --> 02:01:32,590
The reason they call it poor man's
lobster,

2402
02:01:32,591 --> 02:01:36,940
he doesn't really tastes like lobster,
but it's suitable for boiling it and

2403
02:01:36,941 --> 02:01:39,160
dipping it in butter and cocktail sauce
and eating.

2404
02:01:39,260 --> 02:01:40,011
Really?
Yeah.

2405
02:01:40,011 --> 02:01:41,780
But y'all should make fish sandwiches
with it.

2406
02:01:41,870 --> 02:01:43,910
Huh?
They even sell that shit commercially.

2407
02:01:44,690 --> 02:01:49,690
Bourbon guys that have like guys that
like a native American.

2408
02:01:49,980 --> 02:01:53,150
So in the northern Great Lakes you have
a Jibo to Jibo.

2409
02:01:53,151 --> 02:01:57,890
I Indians still carry on White Lake.
They fish for great lakes,

2410
02:01:57,891 --> 02:01:59,750
white fish.
They trap net,

2411
02:01:59,751 --> 02:02:00,710
great legs,
White Fish.

2412
02:02:01,010 --> 02:02:05,940
They're able to sell a bycatch of
Bourbon and they have restaurants and

2413
02:02:05,990 --> 02:02:09,800
like in the cup I got some friends that
do it and they got restaurants in the

2414
02:02:09,801 --> 02:02:12,300
ups that they sell their bourbon into
and they make burgers.

2415
02:02:12,320 --> 02:02:13,500
Sandwiches.
Huh?

2416
02:02:13,850 --> 02:02:16,550
Freshwater link to take them on ice
fishing trip.

2417
02:02:16,760 --> 02:02:19,700
And um,
but for him to leave,

2418
02:02:20,740 --> 02:02:24,170
like he doesn't go into Georgetown,
which is the capital of this country.

2419
02:02:24,350 --> 02:02:27,530
He'd have to go into Georgetown and
start like trying to figure out some

2420
02:02:27,531 --> 02:02:32,531
kind of a visa situation and a passport.
Does he have a birth certificate?

2421
02:02:34,190 --> 02:02:35,060
I don't know what he has.

2422
02:02:35,650 --> 02:02:37,910
I told him that I would try to help him
with all that,

2423
02:02:37,911 --> 02:02:41,120
but he said it's like a very daunting
idea that you would like go and leave

2424
02:02:41,121 --> 02:02:44,360
the country for that.
You'd go in and stay in Georgetown,

2425
02:02:44,420 --> 02:02:47,330
but he has been on a commercial flight.
He did that trip.

2426
02:02:47,590 --> 02:02:49,310
Yeah.
So he has done it yet.

2427
02:02:49,340 --> 02:02:53,030
He has done it.
So he had to get a passport in order to

2428
02:02:53,031 --> 02:02:55,970
do it.
His passport didn't last long and now he

2429
02:02:55,971 --> 02:02:58,670
has no passport anymore is what he's
telling me when I was asking him about

2430
02:02:58,671 --> 02:03:03,170
the feasibility of this and then you
don't need a visa for there,

2431
02:03:03,171 --> 02:03:06,170
but he needed a visa to come here,
but I'm going to figure it out.

2432
02:03:06,260 --> 02:03:08,300
I want to have them up so bad.
Wow.

2433
02:03:08,480 --> 02:03:12,740
Him and his brother Dennis.
One of the things that surprised,

2434
02:03:12,800 --> 02:03:14,870
like one of the things you get is um,

2435
02:03:16,400 --> 02:03:18,120
you know,
you're from what state were you born in?

2436
02:03:18,300 --> 02:03:19,030
New Jersey.
Yeah.

2437
02:03:19,030 --> 02:03:20,160
See,
it's like you've been all over the

2438
02:03:20,370 --> 02:03:21,203
place,
right?

2439
02:03:22,260 --> 02:03:24,750
Imagine that.
Imagine that you hunted and fished and

2440
02:03:24,751 --> 02:03:27,390
farm and that's all you did.
So you're always on the land.

2441
02:03:27,410 --> 02:03:32,340
Yeah,
and you've done it all within a 25 mile,

2442
02:03:32,680 --> 02:03:37,680
a 20 mile radius of your home,
so you're outside hunting and fishing or

2443
02:03:38,400 --> 02:03:43,400
farming or gathering in the jungle every
day and you're in your thirties or

2444
02:03:43,651 --> 02:03:48,651
forties and you've done it in a radius
of 20 miles to what level you understand

2445
02:03:50,551 --> 02:03:55,551
your spot and without the distractions
of the digital shit and without the

2446
02:03:56,340 --> 02:03:59,680
distractions of an occupation.
Oh,

2447
02:03:59,681 --> 02:04:01,440
he doesn't work at all.
Not,

2448
02:04:01,610 --> 02:04:02,411
I mean,
now he did.

2449
02:04:02,411 --> 02:04:05,200
He guides a little bit every year for
the fish.

2450
02:04:05,260 --> 02:04:08,890
He guides a little bit,
but typically not like most days he's

2451
02:04:08,891 --> 02:04:13,891
not engaged in that activity.
So the spatial awareness as the thing

2452
02:04:14,531 --> 02:04:18,280
that's most striking to me in spending
time with,

2453
02:04:18,610 --> 02:04:21,000
with these individuals is,
um,

2454
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:28,000
everything I'm interested in,
what they noticed and what they never

2455
02:04:29,421 --> 02:04:30,254
miss

2456
02:04:31,060 --> 02:04:35,230
it.
It's like you realize that all of the

2457
02:04:35,231 --> 02:04:38,160
bits of information that you're able to
contain your head to allow you to

2458
02:04:38,161 --> 02:04:39,630
function and carry on,
right?

2459
02:04:40,380 --> 02:04:45,380
You're like a comedian and you do shit
with mma and you have a very successful

2460
02:04:45,631 --> 02:04:48,450
podcast and you have a family and you're
digitally very astute.

2461
02:04:48,451 --> 02:04:50,220
And you have opinions about fucking
coffee,

2462
02:04:50,280 --> 02:04:52,950
write all this shit you're widely read,
right?

2463
02:04:53,160 --> 02:04:58,160
That's like all your sort of fill up
your brain with as much as it can hold.

2464
02:04:58,620 --> 02:05:02,820
But for them it's like it seems to be
from my perspective is like all of that

2465
02:05:02,821 --> 02:05:06,300
breadth of knowledge but crammed into
the natural world

2466
02:05:08,040 --> 02:05:11,640
to where every plant,
every tree,

2467
02:05:11,700 --> 02:05:16,700
water its use as what are the other
things and it's like they know as much

2468
02:05:17,940 --> 02:05:22,940
like they know as much as we know,
but it's just focused in a way that our

2469
02:05:24,031 --> 02:05:25,290
breadth of knowledge,
which,

2470
02:05:25,320 --> 02:05:28,740
which would probably be astounding to
them if they realize all the shit we

2471
02:05:28,741 --> 02:05:31,410
knew about,
but they're all that,

2472
02:05:31,620 --> 02:05:35,670
all those bits of information or just
applied in a different way down to like

2473
02:05:35,671 --> 02:05:37,860
a granular understanding of the jungle.

2474
02:05:37,990 --> 02:05:40,230
It would probably be very bizarre for
them to see us.

2475
02:05:40,231 --> 02:05:42,860
Like walk out to this parking lot,
these,

2476
02:05:42,900 --> 02:05:47,550
a little patches of like plants.
We don't have a fucking clue what they

2477
02:05:47,551 --> 02:05:49,150
are.
We pass through them like they,

2478
02:05:49,290 --> 02:05:50,940
they,
they're just peripheral.

2479
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:52,440
There is no like,
I don't know what that is.

2480
02:05:52,500 --> 02:05:53,760
Yeah.
Wow.

2481
02:05:53,820 --> 02:05:55,680
No,
they know everything and there's

2482
02:05:55,920 --> 02:05:58,410
toxicity.
How many thousands and thousands of

2483
02:05:58,411 --> 02:06:02,790
different varieties of plants.
There's no at various times there's 1500

2484
02:06:02,791 --> 02:06:05,100
species of birds.
Listen,

2485
02:06:05,190 --> 02:06:08,640
I like,
there was never a moment when I heard a

2486
02:06:08,641 --> 02:06:11,250
bird call.
There was a.

2487
02:06:11,430 --> 02:06:12,181
I'd never said,
hey,

2488
02:06:12,181 --> 02:06:15,360
what's that bird that everyone there?
It didn't say what the bird was.

2489
02:06:16,950 --> 02:06:21,950
Bird sounds just from sounds
like,

2490
02:06:22,690 --> 02:06:25,350
like in the shit that,
like it,

2491
02:06:25,550 --> 02:06:27,840
it,
it's almost something you have to go see

2492
02:06:27,900 --> 02:06:31,620
is um,
the ability to just like move through

2493
02:06:31,621 --> 02:06:34,410
the jungle and notice everything now.

2494
02:06:34,410 --> 02:06:37,170
Are they like the people in Bolivia
where they're barefoot most of the time?

2495
02:06:37,560 --> 02:06:38,371
Yeah.
But you know,

2496
02:06:38,371 --> 02:06:40,470
that's another bummer is getting more
into shoes,

2497
02:06:40,471 --> 02:06:43,710
man.
A row has still likes to take his shoes

2498
02:06:43,711 --> 02:06:46,920
off when he goes into the jungle.
We went into the jungle after some curse

2499
02:06:46,921 --> 02:06:48,550
out and uh,
and he,

2500
02:06:48,551 --> 02:06:50,520
he pulled his shoes off to be extra
quiet.

2501
02:06:51,390 --> 02:06:53,700
But yeah.
So he'll now and then put flip flops on

2502
02:06:53,701 --> 02:06:55,230
now and before it is.
No Way.

2503
02:06:55,630 --> 02:06:57,660
Wow.
Do they still have the weird feet that

2504
02:06:57,661 --> 02:07:00,540
are all this catalyst and tozer spread
laid out?

2505
02:07:00,710 --> 02:07:03,930
It's very strange the way their feet
look real strange.

2506
02:07:03,960 --> 02:07:04,780
I wasn't,
you know,

2507
02:07:04,780 --> 02:07:09,780
and I was in the Philippines one time in
the highlands where people are just

2508
02:07:10,050 --> 02:07:12,050
hiking mountain trails,
you know,

2509
02:07:12,570 --> 02:07:15,810
severe topography on rocky ground and
the feet there,

2510
02:07:15,811 --> 02:07:17,460
I've never seen anything like it
barefoot.

2511
02:07:18,590 --> 02:07:22,220
It's almost unrecognizable as a human
foot really from your perspective of

2512
02:07:22,230 --> 02:07:23,460
human foot,
what it look like.

2513
02:07:23,850 --> 02:07:25,350
Have uh,
have,

2514
02:07:25,450 --> 02:07:27,940
have your inner man.
He was their photos,

2515
02:07:28,020 --> 02:07:31,070
their feet out Luzon island,
hot,

2516
02:07:31,450 --> 02:07:35,660
Luzon island,
highlands,

2517
02:07:36,340 --> 02:07:40,910
Coalinga,
k a l I n g a feet.

2518
02:07:41,100 --> 02:07:42,260
I don't know,
try that.

2519
02:07:44,330 --> 02:07:48,810
There's probably some high resolution
national geographic's if this,

2520
02:07:48,880 --> 02:07:53,020
if he's any good at his job,
you will be seeing some crazy feat in a

2521
02:07:53,021 --> 02:07:54,130
moment.
You don't.

2522
02:07:54,131 --> 02:07:57,700
Another thing I wanted to
share as you had mentioned,

2523
02:07:57,701 --> 02:08:01,380
a sort of a surreal image is uh,
you know,

2524
02:08:01,390 --> 02:08:05,050
watching a woman in a decay in why shirt
like digging turtle eggs for food,

2525
02:08:05,390 --> 02:08:09,300
um,
through there's,

2526
02:08:09,370 --> 02:08:12,130
there's flowers or you know,
everything's in bloom,

2527
02:08:12,131 --> 02:08:13,140
right?
Um,

2528
02:08:13,570 --> 02:08:15,340
it was just the beginning of the rainy
season,

2529
02:08:15,341 --> 02:08:17,860
sort of some rain,
like everything is in bloom and he's

2530
02:08:17,861 --> 02:08:20,380
flowers just all fall flowers of all
variety,

2531
02:08:20,440 --> 02:08:23,730
hang out over the river and sometimes
you'll pass through.

2532
02:08:23,760 --> 02:08:28,760
It just has this like warm floral smell
that just,

2533
02:08:29,290 --> 02:08:32,620
it's astounding.
I'm it remind me of,

2534
02:08:32,650 --> 02:08:35,280
you know,
and in the end of apocalypse now when

2535
02:08:35,320 --> 02:08:39,160
Kurt's,
when Captain Willard finally catches up

2536
02:08:39,161 --> 02:08:43,780
with Kurtz and Kurtz,
ask them where he's from and he mentions

2537
02:08:43,781 --> 02:08:48,781
Ohio and Kurt's tells him about a river
trip he took with his father on the Ohio

2538
02:08:49,451 --> 02:08:51,310
river when the guardian he wearing in
bloom,

2539
02:08:51,311 --> 02:08:53,860
you know,
he talks about the smell in the end of

2540
02:08:53,860 --> 02:08:55,420
apocalypse now,
but these flowers and smell like that.

2541
02:08:55,690 --> 02:08:57,830
But when the rain would come,
it's going to.

2542
02:08:57,831 --> 02:09:01,210
I can't even see what you got some feet.
Oh,

2543
02:09:01,211 --> 02:09:02,330
you'll find some feet,
boy.

2544
02:09:02,440 --> 02:09:04,370
One trying to find something better.
Here's a.

2545
02:09:05,740 --> 02:09:10,060
So it would rain.
It would knock the all the flowers into

2546
02:09:10,061 --> 02:09:14,170
the river
and you know,

2547
02:09:14,171 --> 02:09:16,240
like the way.
Yeah.

2548
02:09:16,310 --> 02:09:19,870
I love talking well so.
Well from grasping.

2549
02:09:20,650 --> 02:09:23,350
Wow.
They're like almost like a gorilla's

2550
02:09:23,360 --> 02:09:23,861
feed.
Yeah,

2551
02:09:23,861 --> 02:09:28,210
from like from wrapping your,
like wrapping your feet around thing

2552
02:09:28,211 --> 02:09:32,310
rocks and stuff like that.
That one in the middle's I saw,

2553
02:09:32,550 --> 02:09:34,520
I saw,
I saw like a number,

2554
02:09:34,540 --> 02:09:38,770
like not yet quite a few people that had
faith resembled that from,

2555
02:09:39,630 --> 02:09:40,450
from,
from,

2556
02:09:40,450 --> 02:09:42,520
from [inaudible],
like you know,

2557
02:09:42,521 --> 02:09:45,850
down in the Amazon and other areas.
You're just walking on soft ground,

2558
02:09:45,900 --> 02:09:47,560
you know,
but imagine if you're just like walking

2559
02:09:47,561 --> 02:09:52,561
on slippery rocks and you're using your
feet in a way that's not even uncommon.

2560
02:09:53,620 --> 02:09:55,160
So we're,
we're looking at for people that are

2561
02:09:55,161 --> 02:09:59,410
just listening to this,
it's like at the middle of their foot,

2562
02:09:59,411 --> 02:10:01,540
especially that one foot in the middle
to the right.

2563
02:10:01,990 --> 02:10:04,540
It's like he's tea.
It's taking a turn,

2564
02:10:04,541 --> 02:10:07,810
like a hard turn,
like a 15 degree plus turn.

2565
02:10:08,620 --> 02:10:12,880
Why do those seem like disembodied feet?
Because there's just photograph in the

2566
02:10:12,881 --> 02:10:13,714
feet.
I guess

2567
02:10:15,440 --> 02:10:18,430
real old.
This is like a big article about people

2568
02:10:18,431 --> 02:10:20,560
from the Philippines at thing from the
same area.

2569
02:10:20,740 --> 02:10:23,000
Oh Huh.
So wow,

2570
02:10:23,140 --> 02:10:24,460
go back to it for a second,
Jamie,

2571
02:10:24,700 --> 02:10:29,700
because what we're seeing in this is um,
this massive spacing between the big toe

2572
02:10:30,671 --> 02:10:34,160
and then the first toe to the point
where it's like an opposable.

2573
02:10:34,160 --> 02:10:35,690
That's an opposable toe.
Yeah,

2574
02:10:35,691 --> 02:10:38,120
it's crazy.
It seems like almost like an opposable

2575
02:10:38,121 --> 02:10:38,541
toe.
Yeah.

2576
02:10:38,541 --> 02:10:40,670
Almost like a thumb now.
I'm sure.

2577
02:10:40,671 --> 02:10:42,510
What's at play there too?
Really fucked.

2578
02:10:42,540 --> 02:10:45,740
I could make you wonder like at one
point in time was it like that,

2579
02:10:46,370 --> 02:10:47,000
that

2580
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:49,580
that's the thing is you wonder is and,
and I don't know the answer to this,

2581
02:10:49,581 --> 02:10:54,581
but my guess would be that over time you
know that they're not starting out with

2582
02:10:58,761 --> 02:11:01,280
your foot.
Like over time,

2583
02:11:01,340 --> 02:11:04,340
that that's been something that's been
selected for.

2584
02:11:04,520 --> 02:11:06,370
Right?
In a population?

2585
02:11:06,371 --> 02:11:06,480
Yes.

2586
02:11:06,480 --> 02:11:11,220
People like height or like he did just
like this guy's feet.

2587
02:11:11,230 --> 02:11:13,650
Yeah.
Holy Shit.

2588
02:11:15,030 --> 02:11:19,020
Holy Shit.
We're what we're looking at what looks

2589
02:11:19,021 --> 02:11:19,670
like frog,

2590
02:11:19,670 --> 02:11:22,370
but that's not even,
that's not even crazy shoe.

2591
02:11:22,371 --> 02:11:23,450
That's,
isn't that a,

2592
02:11:23,900 --> 02:11:28,900
that's North America people feet and
this guy were h u a o r a n I.

2593
02:11:31,410 --> 02:11:32,990
How do you pronounce that?
Harani.

2594
02:11:33,370 --> 02:11:36,740
I'd have to check where that is.
It's bizarre,

2595
02:11:37,040 --> 02:11:42,040
but it really does show you from fucking
wearing shoes your whole life and given

2596
02:11:42,681 --> 02:11:45,740
the different environment like that.
That's insane.

2597
02:11:46,010 --> 02:11:48,800
Like what we're looking at here,
they literally look like thumbs,

2598
02:11:49,100 --> 02:11:53,210
like they're sticking out of the side,
but it's the same structure as a human

2599
02:11:53,211 --> 02:11:55,670
foot,
meaning that it's the same length of

2600
02:11:55,730 --> 02:11:59,810
toes and just you see that from using it
that way.

2601
02:12:00,020 --> 02:12:03,140
They've just developed this incredible.
You know what's really crazy?

2602
02:12:03,500 --> 02:12:07,140
What is one of the hallmarks of
civilization that shows like a really

2603
02:12:07,760 --> 02:12:10,820
poor choice and footwear when your feet
go the other way,

2604
02:12:11,090 --> 02:12:13,070
when they go in an ineffective
direction,

2605
02:12:13,071 --> 02:12:15,890
they they get,
they get that hammertoe and they climb

2606
02:12:15,891 --> 02:12:17,510
over each other.
These is,

2607
02:12:17,511 --> 02:12:22,010
these people have functional feet to the
point where you know they could probably

2608
02:12:22,011 --> 02:12:23,450
hold something with their feet.

2609
02:12:23,710 --> 02:12:25,560
Yeah.
When I look at a.

2610
02:12:26,440 --> 02:12:30,200
When I look at my wife's feet,
I feel like she's got a foot disease

2611
02:12:30,230 --> 02:12:33,280
very much shaped by a lifetime of office
footwear.

2612
02:12:34,560 --> 02:12:36,540
It's awful.
Especially with women.

2613
02:12:36,570 --> 02:12:39,440
They get that Hammertoe,
that Bunyan thing where their,

2614
02:12:39,450 --> 02:12:42,540
their toes are kind of crossed over to
the center of that thing.

2615
02:12:42,541 --> 02:12:43,950
Well,
it's so weird.

2616
02:12:44,350 --> 02:12:49,290
It's a weird choice that someone is
decided that women should shove their

2617
02:12:49,291 --> 02:12:50,940
toes into these pointy things.

2618
02:12:51,190 --> 02:12:53,110
But,
but uh,

2619
02:12:53,920 --> 02:12:57,520
just like with the,
that I saw the,

2620
02:12:57,910 --> 02:13:02,910
a group of individuals lock onto
polarized sunglasses as being the shit.

2621
02:13:04,440 --> 02:13:05,440
Um,
I,

2622
02:13:05,530 --> 02:13:08,650
if you went back in five years,
I'm telling you,

2623
02:13:09,280 --> 02:13:11,380
instead of bringing beaten,
being barefoot was gonna be wearing

2624
02:13:11,381 --> 02:13:12,214
shoes.

2625
02:13:12,310 --> 02:13:15,040
What if you got those women high heel
shoes and said,

2626
02:13:15,041 --> 02:13:16,780
this is what all the women in the
stretch.

2627
02:13:17,230 --> 02:13:19,050
Of course you could take awhile,
but you get.

2628
02:13:19,110 --> 02:13:20,600
Oh,
that's disgusting though.

2629
02:13:20,601 --> 02:13:22,980
That's foot banding is fucked up right
there.

2630
02:13:22,981 --> 02:13:24,240
That's just insane.
Can you tell them,

2631
02:13:24,280 --> 02:13:28,210
looking at your toes from binding your
feet,

2632
02:13:28,500 --> 02:13:30,210
foot binding in China?
Yeah.

2633
02:13:30,390 --> 02:13:33,360
Well you soft tissue.
It's very flexible.

2634
02:13:33,380 --> 02:13:34,500
So go,
uh,

2635
02:13:34,530 --> 02:13:36,930
go to Cirque du Solei.
Look at those people could do their

2636
02:13:36,931 --> 02:13:39,870
bodies.
The human body is pretty bizarre and its

2637
02:13:39,871 --> 02:13:41,420
ability to adapt,
but it,

2638
02:13:41,490 --> 02:13:41,881
yeah.
You know,

2639
02:13:41,881 --> 02:13:45,720
those groups that used to bind their
children's head to that back to flag in

2640
02:13:45,770 --> 02:13:46,570
your head out,

2641
02:13:46,570 --> 02:13:49,510
well,
how about those people and what part of

2642
02:13:49,511 --> 02:13:54,511
the world was it a where they have that
in the incas,

2643
02:13:56,260 --> 02:14:00,040
the where they have those lines,
the Nazca lines,

2644
02:14:00,100 --> 02:14:02,050
you know,
and they found all these skulls from

2645
02:14:02,051 --> 02:14:04,690
people back then were they,
it stretched their heads out,

2646
02:14:05,020 --> 02:14:07,150
almost made their heads look like
aliens.

2647
02:14:07,270 --> 02:14:08,103
Yeah,
there you go.

2648
02:14:09,070 --> 02:14:09,700
But,
uh,

2649
02:14:09,700 --> 02:14:14,700
see if you find the Inca Inca skulls,
it's so much so that a lot of the really

2650
02:14:15,071 --> 02:14:16,300
loony people said,
look,

2651
02:14:16,320 --> 02:14:19,240
they're trying to be like the aliens
that have come down and given them

2652
02:14:19,241 --> 02:14:21,210
knowledge and.
Oh yeah,

2653
02:14:21,211 --> 02:14:22,000
yeah.

2654
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:23,320
Have you ever been down to,
um,

2655
02:14:24,130 --> 02:14:26,220
do you remember those?
They're,

2656
02:14:26,240 --> 02:14:27,910
they're,
they're held in Salta,

2657
02:14:28,180 --> 02:14:29,920
Argentina.
I went to see him one time.

2658
02:14:29,921 --> 02:14:34,420
But those children,
did they found that were in tombed at

2659
02:14:34,421 --> 02:14:36,820
the top of a mountain and they were
basically freeze dried?

2660
02:14:36,920 --> 02:14:38,740
No,
it's perfectly preserved.

2661
02:14:38,741 --> 02:14:40,690
Children.
What would happen to them?

2662
02:14:40,810 --> 02:14:43,090
Well,
they were taken up and given as the

2663
02:14:43,091 --> 02:14:46,960
offering.
So first it seems based on the stuff

2664
02:14:46,961 --> 02:14:51,850
they had with them that they were prayed
through the incan empire and people

2665
02:14:51,940 --> 02:14:55,090
lavish them with gifts and when they
look at the isotopes and their bodies,

2666
02:14:55,091 --> 02:14:57,340
it's like their diet,
their whole lives,

2667
02:14:57,341 --> 02:15:00,290
they had just had potatoes,
but then you can see the,

2668
02:15:00,291 --> 02:15:03,370
toward the end of their lives,
they're very well fed with meat and fish

2669
02:15:03,371 --> 02:15:07,300
and all kinds of stuff.
And they had just innumerable treasures,

2670
02:15:08,190 --> 02:15:13,190
a gold pieces carved pieces.
So they were taking it seems as though

2671
02:15:13,240 --> 02:15:15,280
they were taken throughout the empire.

2672
02:15:15,400 --> 02:15:16,870
And what,
what's really funny about this,

2673
02:15:16,871 --> 02:15:18,760
speaking of Columbus earlier is it was
like,

2674
02:15:20,080 --> 02:15:24,570
yeah,
so it's like as best they haven't dated

2675
02:15:24,580 --> 02:15:25,900
exactly.
But it seems like,

2676
02:15:26,110 --> 02:15:27,940
I mean it seems like we're talking
about,

2677
02:15:28,020 --> 02:15:29,260
you know,
Columbus 1492.

2678
02:15:29,261 --> 02:15:31,600
It's like we're talking about 1491.
Wow.

2679
02:15:31,660 --> 02:15:35,690
So the height of this empire at,
at the,

2680
02:15:35,890 --> 02:15:40,330
the height of the empire butting up
against it's dramatic and sudden

2681
02:15:40,331 --> 02:15:43,070
collapse with European contact.
But they took a.

2682
02:15:43,080 --> 02:15:43,900
yeah,
I went to see.

2683
02:15:43,900 --> 02:15:46,440
And um,
she was the only,

2684
02:15:46,450 --> 02:15:49,600
they made a deal with indigenous people
where they only put one on display at a

2685
02:15:49,601 --> 02:15:51,430
time,
but she was on display when I was there

2686
02:15:51,550 --> 02:15:55,440
and what do they have their encapsuled.
So they took them,

2687
02:15:56,660 --> 02:15:58,150
well,
I'll tell you how they came to be first.

2688
02:15:58,151 --> 02:16:01,540
So
they were finally dressed,

2689
02:16:01,630 --> 02:16:05,930
had a lot of ornaments and things with
them had been very well fed and the,

2690
02:16:05,950 --> 02:16:09,070
the older group and they took them out
to the high peak,

2691
02:16:09,130 --> 02:16:12,280
I can't remember how they might've been
14 or 15,000 feet above sea level.

2692
02:16:12,610 --> 02:16:16,600
And they built a little tune for him and
sat him in the tomb.

2693
02:16:16,601 --> 02:16:18,670
They were drunk,
they had a lot of rice wine in their

2694
02:16:18,671 --> 02:16:20,770
bodies when they died.
Uh,

2695
02:16:20,950 --> 02:16:24,950
the oldest one mostly putting up some
kind of struggle because she was hitting

2696
02:16:24,970 --> 02:16:29,970
the head with a hammer and acts and they
were just laid out in this thing and

2697
02:16:30,401 --> 02:16:34,630
then kept over with rocks and it's very
stable environment.

2698
02:16:35,080 --> 02:16:36,940
So they froze.
And then,

2699
02:16:37,090 --> 02:16:38,920
you know,
we use now like backpacking food is

2700
02:16:38,921 --> 02:16:40,490
freeze dried food.
Yeah.

2701
02:16:40,600 --> 02:16:42,940
They used to have,
they used to do a very similar thing

2702
02:16:43,210 --> 02:16:48,210
with by just taking potatoes and storing
them at high elevations were what?

2703
02:16:49,451 --> 02:16:54,451
Freeze drying is your liquid.
It's like you freeze something and then

2704
02:16:54,821 --> 02:16:57,730
expel the liquid.
Where liquid goes from a gaseous

2705
02:16:58,350 --> 02:17:03,100
[inaudible] goes from a solid to a gas
without passing through its liquid

2706
02:17:03,101 --> 02:17:05,350
state.
So when you freeze dry food,

2707
02:17:05,351 --> 02:17:07,600
you like freeze dry,
you put it in a freezer and get super

2708
02:17:07,601 --> 02:17:09,310
cold and then you start.

2709
02:17:09,910 --> 02:17:14,910
Then you start putting it under a vacuum
to point where all the water goes

2710
02:17:15,071 --> 02:17:18,370
immediately to a gash state doesn't pass
through a liquid state,

2711
02:17:18,371 --> 02:17:22,690
so it holds its form,
but all the water's gone.

2712
02:17:23,290 --> 02:17:25,450
If it goes to a liquid state,
then it collapses,

2713
02:17:25,451 --> 02:17:28,150
but just hold it's form in the non
water.

2714
02:17:28,151 --> 02:17:33,070
Parts of the cells just stay bound in
their natural shape.

2715
02:17:33,460 --> 02:17:36,850
So they were in this position and
eventually just like expelled tons of

2716
02:17:36,851 --> 02:17:39,580
water without ever thrown out.
And when they found them,

2717
02:17:39,880 --> 02:17:43,060
you can even see the that they had been
chewing cocoa leaves because the high

2718
02:17:43,061 --> 02:17:45,700
elevation,
the kids still have dried coca leaves on

2719
02:17:45,701 --> 02:17:46,900
their lips.
Dude,

2720
02:17:46,901 --> 02:17:48,220
it's wild.
Yeah.

2721
02:17:48,221 --> 02:17:49,540
Me and my wife went there to look at
them.

2722
02:17:49,570 --> 02:17:51,160
Where does it now?
It's in Salta,

2723
02:17:51,161 --> 02:17:52,900
Argentina.
Wow.

2724
02:17:53,140 --> 02:17:55,660
Near the border was very near the border
of Bolivia.

2725
02:17:55,940 --> 02:17:57,770
I wanted to ask you something totally
unrelated,

2726
02:17:57,771 --> 02:18:00,440
but it came up because you've talked
about freeze dried foods.

2727
02:18:00,620 --> 02:18:03,260
I know you cook a lot,
but have you ever.

2728
02:18:03,261 --> 02:18:05,060
I know you eat those mountain house
things,

2729
02:18:05,180 --> 02:18:06,470
but have you ever tried to make your
own.

2730
02:18:06,471 --> 02:18:08,870
Have you ever tried to dehydrate some of
your wild game?

2731
02:18:08,871 --> 02:18:09,950
Oh yeah.
I'm dehydrated.

2732
02:18:10,010 --> 02:18:11,980
I mean anytime you make jerky or
dehydrate and stuff,

2733
02:18:12,080 --> 02:18:15,260
but have you ever made chili and things
like that where you could rehydrated in

2734
02:18:15,261 --> 02:18:17,630
the field trial they've ever made
dehydrated?

2735
02:18:18,440 --> 02:18:21,230
No.
I've assembled a lot of dehydrated

2736
02:18:21,231 --> 02:18:24,500
things,
but I've never d like at what point,

2737
02:18:24,710 --> 02:18:27,410
how many ingredients need to be in
something before it becomes like a

2738
02:18:27,411 --> 02:18:31,090
recipe?
[inaudible] couple chemical.

2739
02:18:31,200 --> 02:18:34,340
That's a recipe.
It pemmican that's got two things.

2740
02:18:34,550 --> 02:18:39,290
Pemmican pulverize meet with liquid fat
poured over the top of it.

2741
02:18:39,530 --> 02:18:41,210
Did you know what that is?
No.

2742
02:18:41,360 --> 02:18:42,800
People.
Fuck that up all the time.

2743
02:18:42,830 --> 02:18:45,020
What feminine is?
I've never heard of it before,

2744
02:18:45,021 --> 02:18:48,140
I don't think so.
It'd be like the original road food.

2745
02:18:48,141 --> 02:18:52,190
You dry meat into Jerky,
air-dry a Jerky,

2746
02:18:52,280 --> 02:18:57,020
then you pull it into what looks like
Sawdust and then you take in stirred and

2747
02:18:57,021 --> 02:19:00,560
liquified fat.
I made some from a buffalo kill and I

2748
02:19:00,561 --> 02:19:03,370
wrote my buffalo book.
I made Pemmican from that and I was.

2749
02:19:03,500 --> 02:19:05,480
And I had it in my fridge.
This as an experiment.

2750
02:19:05,481 --> 02:19:06,830
I kept it for seven years.

2751
02:19:07,040 --> 02:19:10,060
Survival food that can last 50 years.
But that's not pemmican.

2752
02:19:10,400 --> 02:19:12,890
It's not,
it doesn't look like it looks like jerky

2753
02:19:12,891 --> 02:19:16,460
sticks because it's not pulverized.
People just now started all of a sudden

2754
02:19:16,461 --> 02:19:17,540
call.
And like,

2755
02:19:18,960 --> 02:19:21,680
I'm not saying everybody missed,
hardly everybody messes up,

2756
02:19:21,681 --> 02:19:23,180
but it's like a thing that gets messed
up.

2757
02:19:23,570 --> 02:19:25,810
So,
um,

2758
02:19:26,150 --> 02:19:27,410
what was I getting at?
What are asking about?

2759
02:19:27,440 --> 02:19:30,680
No,
I asking you to hydrate or dehydrate a

2760
02:19:30,681 --> 02:19:35,681
bunch of different things and combined
it into a recipe that I then bring with

2761
02:19:37,011 --> 02:19:40,250
me.
The reason I like the reason I used the

2762
02:19:40,251 --> 02:19:44,660
hydrated food and a lot of backpack
hunters use dehydrated food is because

2763
02:19:45,080 --> 02:19:48,550
I'm.
If you have a a,

2764
02:19:48,551 --> 02:19:51,810
a dish made up of dehydrated
ingredients.

2765
02:19:52,050 --> 02:19:55,170
They have different hydration times.
Okay.

2766
02:19:55,290 --> 02:19:59,970
So if you do beans like,
like a piece of meat is going to be

2767
02:20:00,090 --> 02:20:04,720
digestible to you.
My piece of dehydrated meat that's then

2768
02:20:04,721 --> 02:20:06,430
hydrated is going to be digestible to
you.

2769
02:20:06,700 --> 02:20:08,260
A dehydrated being,

2770
02:20:09,350 --> 02:20:09,800
yeah.

2771
02:20:09,800 --> 02:20:12,920
Might take 30 or 40 minutes before it's
going to be in a condition and it

2772
02:20:12,921 --> 02:20:17,180
doesn't rip you apart.
If you fuck yourself up,

2773
02:20:17,600 --> 02:20:19,910
eat straight dried beans.
What happens?

2774
02:20:20,210 --> 02:20:21,530
Just,
it's just you're off.

2775
02:20:21,560 --> 02:20:22,341
Yeah.
You don't know.

2776
02:20:22,341 --> 02:20:23,480
You're someone doesn't know what to do
with it,

2777
02:20:23,481 --> 02:20:24,920
man.
Well knows what to do with.

2778
02:20:24,921 --> 02:20:29,650
It starts producing voluminous amounts
of gas,

2779
02:20:29,720 --> 02:20:31,130
right?
It's off,

2780
02:20:31,160 --> 02:20:32,740
it's horrible.
But with,

2781
02:20:33,230 --> 02:20:35,360
with,
if you could,

2782
02:20:35,390 --> 02:20:38,690
if you take food and cook it to a ready
to eat steak

2783
02:20:40,580 --> 02:20:43,310
and then freeze dry it,
it,

2784
02:20:43,520 --> 02:20:44,353
it,
uh,

2785
02:20:44,450 --> 02:20:47,300
you can rehydrate it Kinda like
simultaneously if you do everything

2786
02:20:47,301 --> 02:20:49,220
right now.
One word were like a hamburger,

2787
02:20:49,221 --> 02:20:51,200
right?
If you're hydrated a hamburger and then

2788
02:20:51,201 --> 02:20:53,630
you add water to it,
you're going to wind up with a soggy ass

2789
02:20:53,631 --> 02:20:57,020
been.
So the trick is like finding things that

2790
02:20:57,230 --> 02:21:01,910
are gonna in a hot water bath are going
to all come back to life kind of at the

2791
02:21:01,911 --> 02:21:05,180
same time.
But places that make backpack food out

2792
02:21:05,181 --> 02:21:10,181
of just dehydrated but not freeze dried
ingredients is a recipe for disaster.

2793
02:21:10,460 --> 02:21:12,050
Really.
Some people liked that shit.

2794
02:21:12,051 --> 02:21:14,630
But for day in,
day out consumption,

2795
02:21:15,530 --> 02:21:19,490
um,
I'm a freeze dry man and it's freeze

2796
02:21:19,491 --> 02:21:20,720
dried.
Something you can do at home,

2797
02:21:21,830 --> 02:21:24,200
you'd have to buy a sublimation chamber.
So No.

2798
02:21:24,350 --> 02:21:26,120
What does the sublimation chamber,
what does that look?

2799
02:21:26,121 --> 02:21:28,430
It's a chamber in which sublimation,
you know what it looks like.

2800
02:21:28,430 --> 02:21:30,500
It looks like the,
it looks like a submarine,

2801
02:21:30,950 --> 02:21:33,770
really small,
but it's very heavy duty because we are

2802
02:21:33,771 --> 02:21:35,510
doing is you're taking,
you're taking food,

2803
02:21:35,960 --> 02:21:39,390
you take ready foods and freeze it.
Right?

2804
02:21:40,300 --> 02:21:44,030
And then you put it into a sublimation
chamber and pull a very strong vacuum on

2805
02:21:44,031 --> 02:21:48,050
it.
And the air pressure gets to a point

2806
02:21:48,051 --> 02:21:53,051
where the liquid cellmates and goes
directly to a gas state and you condense

2807
02:21:53,091 --> 02:21:55,010
it on another surface inside the
chamber,

2808
02:21:55,190 --> 02:21:57,890
but it's out of the food.
Then you take the food out and it's like

2809
02:21:57,891 --> 02:22:00,200
glass.
You can shatter it.

2810
02:22:01,100 --> 02:22:04,730
That's freeze dried food.
But it rehydrates in a real nice way.

2811
02:22:05,060 --> 02:22:09,980
I have heard we a lot of it because we
do a lot of back country trips.

2812
02:22:10,640 --> 02:22:12,380
I've heard everyone's complaints about
it,

2813
02:22:12,381 --> 02:22:17,000
but it's like from my perspective,
which I will argue is a well informed

2814
02:22:17,390 --> 02:22:18,080
perspective.

2815
02:22:18,080 --> 02:22:22,720
It's like it's the lesser of two evils.
It's not that bad for day in,

2816
02:22:22,730 --> 02:22:25,770
day out consumption.
I think that the companies that are do

2817
02:22:25,771 --> 02:22:30,600
freeze dry it just better in my opinion
now when I say that these children are

2818
02:22:30,601 --> 02:22:32,100
freeze dried,
I think some people,

2819
02:22:32,101 --> 02:22:33,660
you know,
people are going to challenge that

2820
02:22:33,661 --> 02:22:35,040
because it's not technically freeze
dried,

2821
02:22:35,041 --> 02:22:40,041
but like a similar thing going on where
they're keeping their form but shedding

2822
02:22:40,591 --> 02:22:43,920
their water and be
shedding water,

2823
02:22:43,921 --> 02:22:46,800
keeping their form of being frozen and
preserved for a long time.

2824
02:22:47,310 --> 02:22:49,560
So yeah,
it's a trip because I was reading a

2825
02:22:49,561 --> 02:22:52,950
podcast or reading a podcast,
listening to a podcast rather with this

2826
02:22:52,951 --> 02:22:55,140
guy was talking about how he's doing
that with his own food,

2827
02:22:55,141 --> 02:22:57,190
for backpacking trips,
dehydrating it.

2828
02:22:57,200 --> 02:22:58,260
Oh Man.
Why not?

2829
02:22:58,320 --> 02:23:00,700
Things like Chili or things along those
lines.

2830
02:23:00,710 --> 02:23:03,450
It's busy cooking Chili and then
dehydrate or just dehydrating the

2831
02:23:03,451 --> 02:23:04,284
components.

2832
02:23:04,290 --> 02:23:05,880
Think dehydrated.
The components.

2833
02:23:05,910 --> 02:23:09,240
I think he was talking about dehydrating
the meat and dehydrating pasta.

2834
02:23:09,260 --> 02:23:10,950
Like like something,
you know,

2835
02:23:10,951 --> 02:23:15,660
like taking some meat with sauce and
putting it together with the pasta.

2836
02:23:16,140 --> 02:23:18,510
Now my brother one time,
he's a very,

2837
02:23:18,511 --> 02:23:21,240
a frugal man.
He didn't realize is that the right

2838
02:23:21,241 --> 02:23:23,820
word?
He just hates a to see food,

2839
02:23:23,821 --> 02:23:25,980
go to waste.
He one time had a bunch of roommates and

2840
02:23:25,981 --> 02:23:28,830
they all moved out and left a ton of
rice and you got sick of cooking rice

2841
02:23:29,370 --> 02:23:34,370
because it takes too long.
He cooked all the rice and then spread

2842
02:23:34,861 --> 02:23:38,430
it out on sheets and dehydrated it and
is a hydrator and,

2843
02:23:38,510 --> 02:23:39,290
and,
and,

2844
02:23:39,290 --> 02:23:42,780
and reverse engineered instant rice.

2845
02:23:45,660 --> 02:23:47,820
That's insane.
Does it take that long?

2846
02:23:47,850 --> 02:23:49,290
What does rice tastes like?
Twenty minutes?

2847
02:23:49,291 --> 02:23:51,630
It seems like it takes more time to do
that talk to him.

2848
02:23:51,631 --> 02:23:55,650
So this is the same guy.
Is this the same guy that found the

2849
02:23:55,651 --> 02:23:57,650
hobos underwear and stole it?
Yup.

2850
02:23:57,780 --> 02:23:59,610
And the same guy that,
um,

2851
02:24:00,090 --> 02:24:01,950
one time our,
our dear,

2852
02:24:01,951 --> 02:24:06,951
late friend was getting married and uh,
his bride,

2853
02:24:09,720 --> 02:24:13,530
his bride at the wedding was at his
bride to b's House and a neighbor was

2854
02:24:13,531 --> 02:24:16,580
away on vacation and the neighborhood
was away on vacation,

2855
02:24:16,590 --> 02:24:17,650
said,
you know,

2856
02:24:17,670 --> 02:24:20,760
since we're out of town,
if you guys want to use our home for

2857
02:24:20,761 --> 02:24:24,090
some of your wedding guests,
go ahead.

2858
02:24:24,810 --> 02:24:29,810
And so all the groomsmen were lodged up
in this house of this man.

2859
02:24:31,171 --> 02:24:33,990
We didn't know who was a neighbor of his
wife's parents.

2860
02:24:34,350 --> 02:24:36,870
And uh,
I don't know why,

2861
02:24:36,871 --> 02:24:40,440
but my brother got the snooping around
and this guy freezer and found that he

2862
02:24:40,441 --> 02:24:40,920
had,
had.

2863
02:24:40,920 --> 02:24:45,120
He had a bull elk in there that had been
in there for seven years and he had like

2864
02:24:45,121 --> 02:24:49,200
this crisis,
this moral crisis where he's trying to

2865
02:24:49,201 --> 02:24:54,201
figure out,
is it morally worse to steal or morally

2866
02:24:54,331 --> 02:24:56,730
worse to allow this man to waste this
meet?

2867
02:24:57,060 --> 02:24:58,890
How long was it built?
We'll book stay.

2868
02:24:58,891 --> 02:24:59,760
Good.
If you freeze it,

2869
02:24:59,761 --> 02:25:01,620
you were fucking pushing it.
A seven years.

2870
02:25:01,621 --> 02:25:05,070
Seven years.
Like what is what is commonly agreed

2871
02:25:05,071 --> 02:25:07,470
upon?
It depends who you ask.

2872
02:25:07,471 --> 02:25:11,700
If you asked me the way I treat trim,
the way I cut trim and rap,

2873
02:25:12,620 --> 02:25:16,440
I don't even blink at two years.
Two years is fine.

2874
02:25:16,490 --> 02:25:18,170
Yeah.
The way I cut trim and rap.

2875
02:25:18,180 --> 02:25:20,160
But when you start seeing for years,
you get a little weird.

2876
02:25:20,180 --> 02:25:21,970
Well,
a thing that I don't let it go.

2877
02:25:22,020 --> 02:25:23,560
I,
I've never done it.

2878
02:25:23,561 --> 02:25:25,900
I would have to think it's going to
start to go [inaudible] the texture,

2879
02:25:25,930 --> 02:25:27,220
the texture will change.

2880
02:25:27,310 --> 02:25:28,860
The texture will change.
Um,

2881
02:25:29,650 --> 02:25:31,630
seven years.
There's two things going on.

2882
02:25:31,631 --> 02:25:33,610
One,
you're borderline until you're starting

2883
02:25:33,611 --> 02:25:35,620
to get the idea that this guy isn't
gonna eat that thing,

2884
02:25:35,650 --> 02:25:36,820
right?
Yeah.

2885
02:25:37,030 --> 02:25:40,600
So he waited out in his head and when he
left he had a bunch of that meet with

2886
02:25:40,601 --> 02:25:42,700
them and took them home and aid because
he just hated to see,

2887
02:25:42,701 --> 02:25:43,250
uh,
oh.

2888
02:25:43,250 --> 02:25:44,820
Outgoing waste.
How did it tastes?

2889
02:25:44,821 --> 02:25:46,810
Seven years old.
I remember we did the ask them.

2890
02:25:46,990 --> 02:25:49,120
Wow.
But his standard of good is different

2891
02:25:49,121 --> 02:25:52,990
than your standard,
his standard of good as acceptable in

2892
02:25:52,991 --> 02:25:56,710
cases like that.
So here's a weird crisis though.

2893
02:25:56,760 --> 02:25:57,870
It makes sense.
But he,

2894
02:25:57,910 --> 02:26:00,040
throughout his whole life,
he always is running into these

2895
02:26:00,041 --> 02:26:05,041
situations like where he cannot,
he cannot let food go to waste.

2896
02:26:06,220 --> 02:26:08,050
So he's like,
if I talk to him right now,

2897
02:26:08,051 --> 02:26:10,450
there's probably 10 more things like
that that have happened to them since I

2898
02:26:10,451 --> 02:26:14,650
talked to him last where he's like,
when he found like he found in his

2899
02:26:14,651 --> 02:26:18,070
alleyway one time and he living in
Montana and still lives in my town

2900
02:26:18,110 --> 02:26:20,380
living in Bozeman founder and his
alleyway,

2901
02:26:20,410 --> 02:26:25,410
like a discarded a discarded cash from a
homeless man and ate all that guys food.

2902
02:26:29,710 --> 02:26:32,080
And he was a phd candidate at the
university.

2903
02:26:35,710 --> 02:26:38,920
You grew up with them.
So I've ever understand him.

2904
02:26:39,580 --> 02:26:42,670
The first time he,
here's where he kind of like,

2905
02:26:42,730 --> 02:26:46,810
we're not where it came from,
but he drew a bear tag when we were in

2906
02:26:46,811 --> 02:26:49,120
Michigan and it was hard to get a bear
take at the time.

2907
02:26:49,440 --> 02:26:51,490
And he drew a bear tag.
And the only way to hunt bears and the

2908
02:26:51,491 --> 02:26:53,210
ups is like,
you know,

2909
02:26:53,230 --> 02:26:54,840
you're not,
you're not going to spot stock him

2910
02:26:54,850 --> 02:26:56,530
because it's flat ground and you can't
see shit.

2911
02:26:56,590 --> 02:26:57,570
Right?
Oh,

2912
02:26:57,580 --> 02:26:59,590
you use dogs.
Are you gonna use bait.

2913
02:26:59,730 --> 02:27:01,000
There's.
You never see a bear.

2914
02:27:01,990 --> 02:27:05,020
So he started to bait pound way.
He was feeding his bait pile ahead of

2915
02:27:05,021 --> 02:27:09,790
the season was just dumpster diving.
So as he's dumpster diving,

2916
02:27:09,820 --> 02:27:13,960
it's like he's living off.
Not only is he baiting the bear with the

2917
02:27:13,961 --> 02:27:16,720
dumpster food,
but he's like living off the dumpster

2918
02:27:16,721 --> 02:27:18,600
dive and food that he found to because
he liked,

2919
02:27:18,601 --> 02:27:20,530
discovered this great richmond November
him.

2920
02:27:21,190 --> 02:27:25,540
He found on that shit.
He found this big box of boxes of

2921
02:27:25,541 --> 02:27:28,480
expired bugles.
You know those little crackers?

2922
02:27:28,570 --> 02:27:30,880
Yeah.
The people like put cheese with shoot

2923
02:27:30,881 --> 02:27:32,740
Cheez whiz into the open ended that
bugle.

2924
02:27:33,100 --> 02:27:36,010
And I've got a picture of him.
He just walking the walk through the

2925
02:27:36,011 --> 02:27:39,760
woods with boxes of bugles under his arm
and get out.

2926
02:27:39,761 --> 02:27:43,390
And he'd be like dumping them out for
the bear and just eating the vehicles

2927
02:27:43,391 --> 02:27:45,290
to.
And then he'll walk back with a handful

2928
02:27:45,291 --> 02:27:47,080
of bugles,
just hate to see wasted food.

2929
02:27:47,560 --> 02:27:51,150
His old girlfriend had a job cooking
like the brown food and the Albertson's,

2930
02:27:51,151 --> 02:27:53,020
you know,
like the display case where they fry all

2931
02:27:53,021 --> 02:27:55,440
it was like burritos and shit.
And um,

2932
02:27:56,470 --> 02:27:58,600
they were,
she was bringing all that home and they

2933
02:27:58,601 --> 02:28:02,350
were living off the food that was going
to the garbage and they came to her and

2934
02:28:02,351 --> 02:28:03,520
said,
you can't steal this food.

2935
02:28:03,521 --> 02:28:05,110
And then she started stealing it
quietly.

2936
02:28:05,590 --> 02:28:08,350
Wow.
He can't stand to see food go to waste.

2937
02:28:09,710 --> 02:28:11,320
Well that's probably noble,
you know,

2938
02:28:11,321 --> 02:28:13,360
it's extra nice is he works for the
Usta.

2939
02:28:14,470 --> 02:28:19,470
So it's good to know that a person like
that is involved and um,

2940
02:28:21,690 --> 02:28:22,150
you know,

2941
02:28:22,150 --> 02:28:26,420
is at least in the room with people who
are thinking about food systems.

2942
02:28:28,990 --> 02:28:32,170
Is it good?
Because it seems like you'll fucking

2943
02:28:32,210 --> 02:28:33,890
anything dude.
He will.

2944
02:28:34,610 --> 02:28:38,480
He's on a different level,
on a different level of toughness and

2945
02:28:38,481 --> 02:28:40,970
shit.
He's the guy who was arm and shrinking

2946
02:28:40,971 --> 02:28:42,470
because morale is trying to hook you up
with.

2947
02:28:42,500 --> 02:28:43,290
Yes.
Yeah.

2948
02:28:43,290 --> 02:28:45,920
He's got a gun.
Did he do anything about that?

2949
02:28:45,921 --> 02:28:47,240
Nope.
Oh Jesus,

2950
02:28:47,870 --> 02:28:48,950
that's not good.
No.

2951
02:28:49,070 --> 02:28:51,800
Once you get that atrophy,
it's a very tough to get it back.

2952
02:28:51,860 --> 02:28:55,190
The ways nerves regenerate takes a long
time.

2953
02:28:55,191 --> 02:28:57,890
It's like a half an inch a year.
He chronicles.

2954
02:28:57,891 --> 02:29:02,891
It's decay by taking a.
he's got a 30 pound a kettle bell and

2955
02:29:05,871 --> 02:29:08,480
he,
he was chronicling his decay by watching

2956
02:29:08,481 --> 02:29:12,640
how many just tricep.
So County Hmi,

2957
02:29:12,650 --> 02:29:14,060
tricep curls.
He could do it.

2958
02:29:14,061 --> 02:29:15,960
That kettlebell with one arm,
one with the other.

2959
02:29:15,970 --> 02:29:19,790
And I think last time we were talking to
him it was 30 or something like 30 on

2960
02:29:19,791 --> 02:29:21,350
one side and 10 on the other side.

2961
02:29:21,410 --> 02:29:22,640
Oh Jesus,
that's bad.

2962
02:29:22,820 --> 02:29:23,460
So,
uh,

2963
02:29:23,460 --> 02:29:28,220
that's a neck issue then he's like a c,
three or c four or something like that.

2964
02:29:28,610 --> 02:29:30,200
He's gone,
he's gone.

2965
02:29:30,390 --> 02:29:31,790
He hasn't,
I shouldn't say he hasn't done anything

2966
02:29:31,791 --> 02:29:32,624
about it.
He's probably,

2967
02:29:32,960 --> 02:29:35,240
if he's listening to this,
he's probably cringing because he would

2968
02:29:35,241 --> 02:29:39,760
feel that he has.
But I'm tell him if he's listening this

2969
02:29:40,350 --> 02:29:42,050
a couple things you need to do.
If it's,

2970
02:29:42,051 --> 02:29:44,150
it seems to me like it's a neck issue
because,

2971
02:29:44,151 --> 02:29:44,661
uh,
when,

2972
02:29:44,661 --> 02:29:49,430
when you start getting elbows and things
where your arm starts atrophying,

2973
02:29:49,431 --> 02:29:52,100
usually it's a cervical disc which is
somewhere up in here.

2974
02:29:52,440 --> 02:29:53,360
Um,
what,

2975
02:29:53,420 --> 02:29:56,990
what he should do is get a neck
decompression device.

2976
02:29:56,991 --> 02:29:58,940
They're very,
they're inexpensive.

2977
02:29:59,150 --> 02:30:02,240
They hook over a door,
you put it on with Velcro,

2978
02:30:02,241 --> 02:30:03,410
you strap it,
and I have one,

2979
02:30:03,770 --> 02:30:04,490
uh,
it,

2980
02:30:04,490 --> 02:30:06,960
it hangs on a thing.
It's like you're hanging yourself by

2981
02:30:06,961 --> 02:30:09,890
your Chin may get some room in there for
all those nerves.

2982
02:30:10,130 --> 02:30:11,600
Exactly.
And well,

2983
02:30:11,780 --> 02:30:14,390
same principles,
these toes spreading out.

2984
02:30:14,690 --> 02:30:16,820
And then other also toasts,
smashing up.

2985
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:22,000
You can kind of soft tissue,
stretch out your neck and decompress all

2986
02:30:22,161 --> 02:30:24,680
those areas.
A lot of people have it from bad

2987
02:30:24,681 --> 02:30:26,750
posture.
A lot of people have from athletics.

2988
02:30:26,751 --> 02:30:29,630
I got it from Jujitsu,
from all this,

2989
02:30:29,680 --> 02:30:31,480
you know,
getting your neck yanked on.

2990
02:30:31,520 --> 02:30:32,930
See that thing right there,
that lady has.

2991
02:30:33,030 --> 02:30:34,640
Yeah,
that's a shitty one because that one's

2992
02:30:34,641 --> 02:30:37,550
working on a bag of water that doesn't
work with a neck like mine.

2993
02:30:37,610 --> 02:30:39,790
You need,
you need to be able to hang on,

2994
02:30:39,900 --> 02:30:41,790
hang on rhino on the other.
I had a,

2995
02:30:41,840 --> 02:30:43,340
I have a thing where I go like,
just click,

2996
02:30:43,370 --> 02:30:43,910
click,
click,

2997
02:30:43,910 --> 02:30:44,450
click,
click,

2998
02:30:44,450 --> 02:30:45,170
click,
click,

2999
02:30:45,170 --> 02:30:49,560
and then I let myself hang from my neck.
And um,

3000
02:30:50,480 --> 02:30:52,760
it's just like that,
just like that.

3001
02:30:52,820 --> 02:30:56,360
See how that guy's just sitting there
reading a magazine and you can adjust

3002
02:30:56,361 --> 02:30:56,570
that.

3003
02:30:56,570 --> 02:30:58,100
So there's a little,
a cord.

3004
02:30:58,120 --> 02:31:01,550
It's tough to see in this photo,
but there's a cord you pull sorta like a

3005
02:31:01,551 --> 02:31:03,270
plunger on.
When I was old school toilets,

3006
02:31:03,300 --> 02:31:04,220
he pulled that click,
click,

3007
02:31:04,221 --> 02:31:04,671
click,
click,

3008
02:31:04,671 --> 02:31:05,121
click,
click,

3009
02:31:05,121 --> 02:31:06,330
click CEO.
He's pulling it right there.

3010
02:31:06,331 --> 02:31:09,800
Yep.
And then you just relax and you just

3011
02:31:09,850 --> 02:31:12,200
gotta learn how to go with it and sort
of relaxed.

3012
02:31:12,201 --> 02:31:15,500
And it feels weird at first because a
lot of pressure but it's pulling your

3013
02:31:15,501 --> 02:31:17,600
neck literally pulling your neck.
You can feel.

3014
02:31:17,601 --> 02:31:20,550
Sometimes when I'm really relaxed I feel
like pop.

3015
02:31:20,830 --> 02:31:24,540
I feel like something pop little tissue
separation's in there.

3016
02:31:24,570 --> 02:31:26,820
Does it have,
do you feel that it's gotten better

3017
02:31:26,930 --> 02:31:28,020
longterm?
Oh yeah,

3018
02:31:28,021 --> 02:31:30,480
for sure.
And it feels like really relaxing,

3019
02:31:30,810 --> 02:31:32,680
like after it's over I feel like,
oh,

3020
02:31:33,060 --> 02:31:34,620
I feel like it just takes a weight off
of,

3021
02:31:34,621 --> 02:31:36,990
you know,
I think there's a tremendous amount.

3022
02:31:36,990 --> 02:31:38,690
I think sitting is terrible.
These,

3023
02:31:38,720 --> 02:31:42,000
these seats that we're in right now are
exceptional because they're ergonomic

3024
02:31:42,030 --> 02:31:43,950
chairs.
You use them right if you use them.

3025
02:31:43,951 --> 02:31:46,770
Right.
I'm pretty cautious about sitting up

3026
02:31:46,771 --> 02:31:49,860
straight.
But from back injuries I've been very,

3027
02:31:49,861 --> 02:31:54,180
very cautious about working out all the
muscles around my back,

3028
02:31:54,210 --> 02:31:57,180
which I didn't really.
I just worked out and figure those

3029
02:31:57,181 --> 02:31:59,940
things to take care of themselves.
Now are treat them as like a,

3030
02:32:00,030 --> 02:32:04,140
just like brushing my teeth,
like my spinal column and all those

3031
02:32:04,470 --> 02:32:07,260
supporting muscles in the spine.
Those are huge.

3032
02:32:07,290 --> 02:32:08,760
They need,
they need to be exercised.

3033
02:32:09,150 --> 02:32:12,720
And especially if you do anything,
like you guys pack out a lot of weight.

3034
02:32:12,840 --> 02:32:14,370
Yeah.
That's a big one.

3035
02:32:14,520 --> 02:32:19,520
And that's where he feels that
he had SCIATICA.

3036
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:20,880
Right?
That's lower.

3037
02:32:20,881 --> 02:32:22,530
That's a yard.
That was a different thing.

3038
02:32:22,531 --> 02:32:23,550
But he,
he,

3039
02:32:24,030 --> 02:32:29,030
he knows he liked traces that
to a specific animal that he's packing

3040
02:32:32,040 --> 02:32:32,760
out.

3041
02:32:32,760 --> 02:32:35,520
Make sense?
Because Sciatica is,

3042
02:32:35,550 --> 02:32:38,490
what's Attica is,
is a disc that's bulging,

3043
02:32:38,491 --> 02:32:42,420
meaning the disc,
the soft tissue in between the two hard

3044
02:32:42,421 --> 02:32:47,421
bones is pushing out and it's pressing
up against the nerve and causes pain

3045
02:32:47,521 --> 02:32:51,240
that shoots down your ass and your lower
legs and a lot of people don't even

3046
02:32:51,241 --> 02:32:54,480
recognize it as a lower back issue
because maybe their back is not really

3047
02:32:54,481 --> 02:32:57,480
that painful,
but the last leg in the ass as painful,

3048
02:32:57,780 --> 02:33:02,190
what the fuck is going on here?
I had a similar issue with my neck where

3049
02:33:02,191 --> 02:33:05,970
it was pushing on my older nerve and I
was getting this elbow pain and I was

3050
02:33:05,971 --> 02:33:06,780
like,
fuck,

3051
02:33:06,780 --> 02:33:10,500
this really hurts,
like down my arm and in the back of my

3052
02:33:10,501 --> 02:33:12,750
tricep.
And then I started getting numbness in

3053
02:33:12,751 --> 02:33:15,240
my fingers and that's when I started
figuring out what was going on.

3054
02:33:15,840 --> 02:33:18,440
Then I went to a doctor,
I went to a chiropractor first,

3055
02:33:18,450 --> 02:33:19,920
which is a fucking giant mistake.

3056
02:33:19,950 --> 02:33:22,650
I spent a year,
but do not believe in chiropractors.

3057
02:33:22,710 --> 02:33:27,130
I don't believe in chiropractors at all.
I think it's 98 percent horseshit.

3058
02:33:27,690 --> 02:33:29,000
That's what I think.
And um,

3059
02:33:29,070 --> 02:33:31,650
I don't know,
but I think chiropractors that are

3060
02:33:31,651 --> 02:33:33,900
smart,
they incorporate things that I think are

3061
02:33:33,901 --> 02:33:34,830
beneficial,
cold,

3062
02:33:34,831 --> 02:33:37,230
laser massage,
a lot of different things.

3063
02:33:37,231 --> 02:33:39,060
But I think that manipulation that they
do,

3064
02:33:39,061 --> 02:33:43,140
unless you have like some sort of
significant scoliosis or something,

3065
02:33:43,141 --> 02:33:45,660
they're attempting to slowly put back
into position.

3066
02:33:46,140 --> 02:33:48,810
I think most of the time it's just
popping your neck and it just feels

3067
02:33:48,811 --> 02:33:51,840
good.
But I just like in an immediate sense,

3068
02:33:51,870 --> 02:33:55,590
I went to a guy that's a very nice guy
and he was trying to tell me that I

3069
02:33:55,591 --> 02:33:58,230
didn't have a bulging disc because he
was pushing down on the top of my head

3070
02:33:58,470 --> 02:34:00,540
and it didn't hurt.
I'm like,

3071
02:34:00,541 --> 02:34:02,430
okay.
So I was listening to him.

3072
02:34:02,490 --> 02:34:05,040
I listened to this guy for like a
fucking year.

3073
02:34:05,070 --> 02:34:07,830
I had treatment with him and I still
have these neck problems and back

3074
02:34:07,831 --> 02:34:09,730
problems.
And then finally I got an MRI and

3075
02:34:09,731 --> 02:34:10,021
they're like,
yeah,

3076
02:34:10,021 --> 02:34:13,560
you got a bulging disc.
And I remember being angry.

3077
02:34:13,980 --> 02:34:17,530
I remember being angry because I was
angry that I was being treated by who is

3078
02:34:17,531 --> 02:34:20,380
a professional that really didn't know
what the fuck they were talking about

3079
02:34:20,470 --> 02:34:23,530
and they were treating something that
was a significant issue that I was

3080
02:34:23,531 --> 02:34:27,640
experiencing a real deterioration of my
function,

3081
02:34:27,970 --> 02:34:31,030
pain.
I wasn't able to do Jujitsu correctly.

3082
02:34:31,270 --> 02:34:33,280
There was a lot of a lot of problems
that I was dealing with.

3083
02:34:33,281 --> 02:34:33,821
I was like,
well,

3084
02:34:33,821 --> 02:34:35,230
what the fuck is this?
Like how to?

3085
02:34:35,410 --> 02:34:38,800
And then I started talking to doctors
about it and when you have a bulging

3086
02:34:38,801 --> 02:34:42,200
disc man,
they want to cut you open like like

3087
02:34:42,310 --> 02:34:43,330
European,
Jada,

3088
02:34:43,331 --> 02:34:44,420
and you got to golden silence.

3089
02:34:44,450 --> 02:34:47,970
That's a thing that my bros talking
about is the procedure.

3090
02:34:47,980 --> 02:34:52,980
He's very nervous about a procedure that
he could or could not do well for some

3091
02:34:53,171 --> 02:34:56,650
people it's not a bad move depending on
whether or not your brother's willing to

3092
02:34:56,651 --> 02:35:00,910
do all the different things that can,
but he's got a lot of atrophy already,

3093
02:35:00,970 --> 02:35:03,730
which is a real bad thing is noticeable.
Yeah.

3094
02:35:03,970 --> 02:35:06,280
That's not good because that shit
doesn't grow back.

3095
02:35:06,370 --> 02:35:10,070
Yeah.
Bas rutten has it real bad boss route

3096
02:35:10,080 --> 02:35:14,650
and former UFC heavyweight champion.
He fucked his neck up and went through a

3097
02:35:14,651 --> 02:35:18,100
bunch of different treatments and then
eventually wound up getting fused.

3098
02:35:18,220 --> 02:35:18,930
He's got a,
uh,

3099
02:35:18,930 --> 02:35:23,560
I believe two discs in,
maybe more in his neck fused together

3100
02:35:23,800 --> 02:35:27,280
where he doesn't have any disc tissue.
They just screw the bones and together

3101
02:35:27,281 --> 02:35:29,590
and remove the disc tissue and stabilize
the area,

3102
02:35:29,980 --> 02:35:33,910
but his right arm is significantly
smaller than his left arm to the point

3103
02:35:33,911 --> 02:35:36,880
where he calls it baby arm and this is a
former UFC heavyweight champion of the

3104
02:35:36,881 --> 02:35:37,714
world.

3105
02:35:37,780 --> 02:35:41,650
And what's ironic is that Sullivan came
from fighting,

3106
02:35:41,651 --> 02:35:45,460
but the last thing came from doing a
stunt on sons of anarchy.

3107
02:35:45,980 --> 02:35:47,910
He was a,
in some sort of a fight believer,

3108
02:35:47,930 --> 02:35:50,800
sons of anarchy,
some sort of a fight scene where they

3109
02:35:50,801 --> 02:35:53,830
were doing some things and some guy was
supposed to like throw them on the

3110
02:35:53,831 --> 02:35:54,880
ground.
He landed on his head.

3111
02:35:55,090 --> 02:35:57,070
So all of that actual flight.
And then you get fucked up,

3112
02:35:57,071 --> 02:36:01,270
pretend fight.
And it's bad man.

3113
02:36:01,271 --> 02:36:03,520
I mean,
he's slowly starting to come back,

3114
02:36:03,521 --> 02:36:08,130
but I've known boss to have this issue
for a we.

3115
02:36:08,200 --> 02:36:13,200
We worked together on a movie before my
seven year old daughter was born and he

3116
02:36:15,131 --> 02:36:19,530
had the issue then and so for seven
years and still now does.

3117
02:36:19,531 --> 02:36:22,240
It still does.
It's coming back slowly.

3118
02:36:22,510 --> 02:36:25,750
But when I'm talking about is like,
I think there's some that like the way

3119
02:36:25,751 --> 02:36:29,620
that your nerves regenerate is extremely
slow.

3120
02:36:29,890 --> 02:36:32,920
They can deteriorate quickly.
Like the attribute can happen pretty

3121
02:36:32,921 --> 02:36:35,620
quick,
but the way it regenerates is extremely

3122
02:36:35,621 --> 02:36:37,660
slow.
So they say once you have atrophy,

3123
02:36:37,870 --> 02:36:40,480
you're fucked.
Like you gotta act on it right away.

3124
02:36:40,600 --> 02:36:43,210
That's the thing they told me when I had
lyme disease.

3125
02:36:43,211 --> 02:36:47,110
Is that
a thing that fucks you up as the nerve

3126
02:36:47,111 --> 02:36:48,010
damage?
Yeah,

3127
02:36:48,370 --> 02:36:51,490
and then people peep.
Allow people to think that they always

3128
02:36:51,491 --> 02:36:54,610
have it.
Put the like you had a thing.

3129
02:36:54,760 --> 02:36:56,410
It's treated,
it's gone,

3130
02:36:56,800 --> 02:37:00,070
but it will live with you for so long
because of the damage to your nerves.

3131
02:37:00,071 --> 02:37:03,820
It's just so slow to recuperate.
I talked to a doctor about lyme disease

3132
02:37:03,821 --> 02:37:05,800
and he said,
it's not just a lyme disease you're

3133
02:37:05,801 --> 02:37:08,440
dealing with said lyme disease is this
overall term.

3134
02:37:08,740 --> 02:37:12,280
He said,
you can get a tick that has 100

3135
02:37:12,281 --> 02:37:14,290
pathogens in it.
When you look at that list of Shit,

3136
02:37:14,291 --> 02:37:14,990
it gets scary.

3137
02:37:14,990 --> 02:37:18,410
It's scary as fuck,
and they connected it to more jealous.

3138
02:37:18,411 --> 02:37:21,830
Do you know what more gentleman's is?
No challenge challenges a disease that a

3139
02:37:21,831 --> 02:37:25,130
lot of times they think of psychosomatic
because there is some sort of a neuro

3140
02:37:25,131 --> 02:37:29,320
toxicity involved in lyme disease and
all these people that have more jealous,

3141
02:37:29,650 --> 02:37:33,400
a almost without a doubt have lyme
disease as well and wouldn't.

3142
02:37:33,440 --> 02:37:36,800
More gallons is is they have they start
itching it themselves and they think

3143
02:37:36,801 --> 02:37:39,770
they have fibers growing out of their
body and they start hallucinating.

3144
02:37:40,190 --> 02:37:42,800
Well,
most most of the time it's treated as a

3145
02:37:42,801 --> 02:37:45,680
psychosomatic disorder.
Like they'll get carpet fibers in their

3146
02:37:45,681 --> 02:37:48,920
body and they'll claim these carpet
fibers are coming out of their body and

3147
02:37:48,921 --> 02:37:51,980
growing others jail.
But I talked to this doctor who was the

3148
02:37:51,981 --> 02:37:53,840
only loose,
had person that's sort of explained it

3149
02:37:53,841 --> 02:37:57,440
to me because he's a doctor and he has
more jealous and he was saying,

3150
02:37:57,441 --> 02:38:00,110
and he also has lyme disease and he says
to a person,

3151
02:38:00,140 --> 02:38:01,740
they all have lyme disease,
uh,

3152
02:38:01,890 --> 02:38:05,030
that he's encountered at least,
but he was saying that he was looking at

3153
02:38:05,031 --> 02:38:08,480
himself in the mirror and he saw
something moving across the surface of

3154
02:38:08,481 --> 02:38:12,080
his eye and he knew it was a
hallucination and he realized it was a

3155
02:38:12,081 --> 02:38:15,800
hallucination as a doctor,
as an educated man and medicine and

3156
02:38:15,801 --> 02:38:18,260
still was seeing it and was freaking
out.

3157
02:38:18,260 --> 02:38:19,560
And then that.
And then he realized,

3158
02:38:19,670 --> 02:38:21,500
oh,
there's some sort of an extreme

3159
02:38:21,710 --> 02:38:24,980
neurotoxic effect that this stuff has,
you know.

3160
02:38:25,040 --> 02:38:28,490
And then he started doing like some
pretty deep investigation into what

3161
02:38:28,491 --> 02:38:30,110
constitutes lyme disease.
And he's like,

3162
02:38:30,111 --> 02:38:30,950
well,
it's not like,

3163
02:38:31,250 --> 02:38:32,190
you know,
you know,

3164
02:38:32,200 --> 02:38:34,170
you have herpes,
you know.

3165
02:38:34,200 --> 02:38:35,120
No,
it's not like that.

3166
02:38:35,390 --> 02:38:39,170
Because like you get bit by something,
you got a bunch of shit in that cocktail

3167
02:38:39,290 --> 02:38:41,420
of whatever that disgusting tickets
carrying around.

3168
02:38:41,600 --> 02:38:43,100
And it's variable.
You know,

3169
02:38:43,101 --> 02:38:46,340
you might get it from one part of the
east coast and it has,

3170
02:38:46,341 --> 02:38:47,270
you know,
50 things,

3171
02:38:47,271 --> 02:38:49,890
you might get it from another as 13
things and,

3172
02:38:50,020 --> 02:38:53,030
but he's saying with the people that
have more gentleman's what he believes

3173
02:38:53,031 --> 02:38:56,690
is they're suffering from hallucinations
brought on by lyme disease.

3174
02:38:56,970 --> 02:38:58,860
That's,
that's the thing about lying that I

3175
02:38:58,861 --> 02:39:00,240
found was,
um,

3176
02:39:01,560 --> 02:39:05,290
about medicine and about people and
about mysterious diseases.

3177
02:39:05,340 --> 02:39:09,270
Like I quit doing it now,
but I would get in arguments with people

3178
02:39:09,900 --> 02:39:12,210
were like,
I was trying to deal with it and finding

3179
02:39:12,211 --> 02:39:14,360
out about it.
And people were telling me like,

3180
02:39:14,410 --> 02:39:15,510
here's what's happening to me.
I'm like,

3181
02:39:15,511 --> 02:39:17,550
well no,
I was told that's not how it works

3182
02:39:17,910 --> 02:39:22,610
because there's so much a scent that you
bring up earlier about a doctor or

3183
02:39:22,620 --> 02:39:23,790
chiropractor telling you the wrong
thing.

3184
02:39:24,150 --> 02:39:25,300
There's so much,
um,

3185
02:39:27,180 --> 02:39:30,150
subject,
subjectivity in the fucking medical

3186
02:39:30,151 --> 02:39:34,590
world that it's like on one hand all
these people were sort of going through

3187
02:39:34,591 --> 02:39:35,424
this,
uh,

3188
02:39:36,120 --> 02:39:38,250
this regimen,
this educational regimen,

3189
02:39:38,730 --> 02:39:40,080
which is,
you know,

3190
02:39:40,370 --> 02:39:42,090
it's like there's like government
oversight.

3191
02:39:42,540 --> 02:39:44,400
There's certain criteria you need to
meet,

3192
02:39:44,520 --> 02:39:46,260
right?
Things needed to pass.

3193
02:39:46,830 --> 02:39:49,680
And you think you already sort of like
have this unifying effect,

3194
02:39:50,160 --> 02:39:54,210
but people come out on the other end who
have gone through kind of the same

3195
02:39:54,211 --> 02:39:57,330
educational system telling you fuck with
wildly different shit.

3196
02:39:57,420 --> 02:40:00,330
Yeah,
wildly different shit about the problems

3197
02:40:00,390 --> 02:40:04,550
where one guy like you could walk in,
one guy's going to do a surgery and the

3198
02:40:04,550 --> 02:40:05,011
next day I was like,
oh,

3199
02:40:05,011 --> 02:40:05,844
no way.

3200
02:40:06,590 --> 02:40:10,250
Yeah.
Who was been in his balls?

3201
02:40:10,910 --> 02:40:13,770
Who was it wasn't Steevo right?
Who the fuck was it?

3202
02:40:15,260 --> 02:40:18,180
Said that San Antonio.
I think Andrew Santina.

3203
02:40:18,450 --> 02:40:21,690
He was telling me that he went to.
He had assistant his balls and he

3204
02:40:21,691 --> 02:40:25,620
thought he had bowel cancer,
went to a doctor and one doctor told him

3205
02:40:25,830 --> 02:40:29,070
that he has excess come stored up in his
balls,

3206
02:40:29,450 --> 02:40:33,210
sperm that stored up in his balls and
that's what's causing this not.

3207
02:40:33,220 --> 02:40:36,570
He went home to his wife and said he
went to another doctor now he wasn't

3208
02:40:36,571 --> 02:40:40,960
married at the time.
He was young man that went head.

3209
02:40:41,840 --> 02:40:44,640
And the second doctor said,
who the fuck was that doctor?

3210
02:40:44,641 --> 02:40:48,300
That guy should lose his ability to
practice like you don't get calm stored

3211
02:40:48,301 --> 02:40:52,770
up in your balls and it makes some sort
of a not like he's saying,

3212
02:40:52,890 --> 02:40:56,400
who told you this?
A fucking real practicing doctor told

3213
02:40:56,401 --> 02:40:57,234
him that.

3214
02:40:57,630 --> 02:40:59,730
Yeah.
I used to go into it when I was younger.

3215
02:40:59,820 --> 02:41:04,820
I'd go into it thinking it was like
going to those like going to get an oil

3216
02:41:04,951 --> 02:41:05,784
change,
right?

3217
02:41:06,290 --> 02:41:07,970
You could have 20 people in there.
All good.

3218
02:41:07,980 --> 02:41:11,820
Change your oil like the same way.
What we do is we drain it and put new

3219
02:41:11,821 --> 02:41:13,020
shit in.
I'm like,

3220
02:41:13,021 --> 02:41:15,120
great,
now I realize that Mr. fucking roll the

3221
02:41:15,121 --> 02:41:17,810
dice man.
Roll the dice and here's what you're

3222
02:41:17,820 --> 02:41:20,340
going to try to mitigate that by doing
some research,

3223
02:41:20,610 --> 02:41:22,230
but it really is like,
I'll have the guys going to tell him

3224
02:41:22,231 --> 02:41:23,330
he's not gonna.
Tell me the same thing there guys.

3225
02:41:23,400 --> 02:41:24,650
Gonna tell me.
The big thing

3226
02:41:24,850 --> 02:41:28,030
comes to health and this is one of the
things that I have a big problem with

3227
02:41:28,031 --> 02:41:32,020
when it comes to anything dealing with
the back is preventative maintenance is

3228
02:41:32,021 --> 02:41:34,870
like one of the most important things
for back health.

3229
02:41:35,300 --> 02:41:38,710
We're sitting in desks all day and most
people are not sitting up straight.

3230
02:41:38,711 --> 02:41:40,060
They're not sitting a book.
Good thing.

3231
02:41:40,061 --> 02:41:43,360
It's like one of those balls,
those Jim balls was big balance balls.

3232
02:41:43,361 --> 02:41:46,270
Those are great to sit on because they
forced you to kind of stabilize yourself

3233
02:41:46,300 --> 02:41:50,650
and use your core muscles or some sort
of an ergonomic chair forcing you to

3234
02:41:50,651 --> 02:41:53,530
stabilize,
but doctor's not telling you,

3235
02:41:53,531 --> 02:41:55,810
hey man,
you got to take a yoga class a couple

3236
02:41:55,810 --> 02:41:57,580
days a week.
You got to do something to straighten

3237
02:41:57,581 --> 02:42:00,160
out your posture.
You got to do something to make sure

3238
02:42:00,161 --> 02:42:02,750
that your spine is strong enough to be
caring about.

3239
02:42:02,800 --> 02:42:05,920
You can't slump forward because you're
putting undue pressure on these

3240
02:42:05,921 --> 02:42:07,090
different portions of your back.

3241
02:42:07,260 --> 02:42:10,150
Is that a significant amount of doctors
are just not fucking telling you that.

3242
02:42:10,220 --> 02:42:10,871
They were like,
Oh yeah,

3243
02:42:10,871 --> 02:42:13,540
your disc is bulging.
We're going to have to do a disectomy.

3244
02:42:13,660 --> 02:42:16,180
No worries.
It's outpatient is outpatient procedure,

3245
02:42:16,330 --> 02:42:19,840
but then not telling you is they're.
They're chopping off of a chunk of this

3246
02:42:19,900 --> 02:42:22,540
finite material.
There's a small amount of material that

3247
02:42:22,541 --> 02:42:24,700
separates your discs and when they talk
about,

3248
02:42:24,701 --> 02:42:27,460
oh,
I have disc degenerative disorder,

3249
02:42:27,610 --> 02:42:29,240
it's a disease,
my disc,

3250
02:42:29,270 --> 02:42:31,630
no stop.
It's not a disease.

3251
02:42:31,690 --> 02:42:36,010
What's going on is you're compressing
your body through weightlifting through

3252
02:42:36,370 --> 02:42:40,060
extreme exercise.
Your body is slowly getting smushed

3253
02:42:40,061 --> 02:42:42,030
down.
You're not allowing it to recover.

3254
02:42:42,031 --> 02:42:44,590
You're not stretching it out.
You're not strengthening all those core

3255
02:42:44,591 --> 02:42:46,390
muscles.
You're not giving it some time off.

3256
02:42:46,420 --> 02:42:50,330
You're probably engaging the same
damaging activity over and over again

3257
02:42:50,331 --> 02:42:52,780
and toughing it out.
If there's one thing you should never

3258
02:42:52,781 --> 02:42:54,940
fucking tough out,
it's a back issue.

3259
02:42:55,270 --> 02:42:56,920
Anytime there's something going on with
your back,

3260
02:42:57,190 --> 02:42:59,620
don't tough it out.
Don't try to work through it,

3261
02:42:59,650 --> 02:43:01,810
just don't because you're going to fuck
it up worse,

3262
02:43:01,811 --> 02:43:04,900
and then it's going to get to a point
where it just does not recover it and

3263
02:43:04,901 --> 02:43:06,250
then you're going to have to get
surgery.

3264
02:43:07,560 --> 02:43:09,810
This is all.
This is making me super self conscious

3265
02:43:09,811 --> 02:43:12,160
about how I like Larry King,
man

3266
02:43:12,400 --> 02:43:15,880
so bad,
a chair and I used to much more.

3267
02:43:15,881 --> 02:43:19,390
I do try to sit up as much as I can now,
but these chairs have been here.

3268
02:43:19,391 --> 02:43:21,970
I went away for a couple of days trying
to sit straighter,

3269
02:43:22,880 --> 02:43:24,940
staring at you,
sitting all nice for three hours.

3270
02:43:25,150 --> 02:43:26,170
I try,
man.

3271
02:43:26,171 --> 02:43:29,410
I didn't always used to be good at it.
I used to slump quite a bit before I had

3272
02:43:29,411 --> 02:43:30,900
back issues.
I got to catch up.

3273
02:43:30,940 --> 02:43:34,930
These chairs are called a capisce co
chairs there from Ergo depot.

3274
02:43:35,510 --> 02:43:38,110
Um,
you can get an Ergo depot.com and get

3275
02:43:38,111 --> 02:43:39,930
these fucking things.
So the shit they're,

3276
02:43:39,950 --> 02:43:42,460
they're comfortable enough to sit in to.
I've been on,

3277
02:43:42,461 --> 02:43:45,940
some of them were your knees slide in
and there's a pad against your Shin?

3278
02:43:46,630 --> 02:43:49,930
Those are kind of gross.
These seem much more like an actual

3279
02:43:49,931 --> 02:43:51,940
chair,
but they're super comfortable.

3280
02:43:51,970 --> 02:43:54,220
What's it called?
It's called a cup hisco.

3281
02:43:55,030 --> 02:43:56,230
So that's a good drink.
I know.

3282
02:43:56,470 --> 02:43:58,450
Ergo depot.com.
No,

3283
02:43:58,451 --> 02:44:02,310
they didn't pay me to say that,
but these things are the shit backs.

3284
02:44:02,320 --> 02:44:05,800
Man's vacs or the one thing like when
people have these heavy packouts and

3285
02:44:05,801 --> 02:44:08,800
everybody likes to pride themselves on
150 pounds.

3286
02:44:08,801 --> 02:44:10,680
Seven miles.
You don't.

3287
02:44:10,850 --> 02:44:12,580
I'm telling.
I'm prone to saying those kinds of

3288
02:44:12,581 --> 02:44:14,610
things.
I tell everybody packed,

3289
02:44:14,620 --> 02:44:17,410
take 75 and do it twice.
Police and even,

3290
02:44:17,411 --> 02:44:18,400
that's a lot,
man.

3291
02:44:18,820 --> 02:44:21,610
I have this new thing that I go.
Why do people,

3292
02:44:23,080 --> 02:44:25,330
why do they like to talk about?
Because you want to be bad asses.

3293
02:44:25,780 --> 02:44:26,830
Yeah.
But you'd never be like,

3294
02:44:26,831 --> 02:44:29,260
yeah man.
I jumped out from the truck and just

3295
02:44:29,261 --> 02:44:32,980
joke the way right in time will tell
their friends to,

3296
02:44:33,010 --> 02:44:35,500
you know Mike,
he packed out to elk quarters on his

3297
02:44:35,501 --> 02:44:36,380
back.
Dude,

3298
02:44:36,390 --> 02:44:39,610
Dude's a fucking savage and I got
[inaudible] probably going to have no

3299
02:44:39,611 --> 02:44:40,170
legs.

3300
02:44:40,170 --> 02:44:43,300
Dude's a fucking dumb ass.
Fucking legs are gonna stop working.

3301
02:44:43,740 --> 02:44:46,060
Probably like got a massive bulge in his
back.

3302
02:44:46,090 --> 02:44:46,640
No,
I,

3303
02:44:46,640 --> 02:44:48,180
I'm guilty because I,
uh,

3304
02:44:48,190 --> 02:44:50,800
I traffic in those stories and when I
hear those stories I'm like,

3305
02:44:50,801 --> 02:44:51,634
right on,
Bro.

3306
02:44:53,430 --> 02:44:54,670
Well,
you know how hard it is.

3307
02:44:54,671 --> 02:44:58,120
That's why when you've done a pack out,
a real packout,

3308
02:44:58,180 --> 02:44:58,601
you know,
uh,

3309
02:44:58,601 --> 02:45:01,300
hardest,
I remember when we shot that mule deer

3310
02:45:01,301 --> 02:45:04,210
right there in Montana and we only
walked like,

3311
02:45:04,211 --> 02:45:06,370
what was it,
two miles maybe,

3312
02:45:06,790 --> 02:45:11,140
and we had the meat split up between
like three of us,

3313
02:45:11,410 --> 02:45:14,740
so it was probably only like 50 pounds
on everybody's back.

3314
02:45:14,741 --> 02:45:16,120
And I was like,
Holy Shit.

3315
02:45:16,390 --> 02:45:19,210
Once he finally got to camp two miles
pretty,

3316
02:45:19,211 --> 02:45:21,220
pretty flat.
It wasn't that hilly.

3317
02:45:21,370 --> 02:45:22,580
Yeah.
If you're not accustomed to this

3318
02:45:22,980 --> 02:45:24,100
exhausting.
Yeah.

3319
02:45:24,150 --> 02:45:26,770
So if you're not accustomed to getting
bit by bs six times a day,

3320
02:45:26,771 --> 02:45:27,760
it's overwhelming.

3321
02:45:27,790 --> 02:45:28,930
So I should tell people that,
uh,

3322
02:45:28,931 --> 02:45:31,540
the outdoorsman,
I know a company that you liked their

3323
02:45:31,541 --> 02:45:34,830
products as well.
They make an atlas trainer now it's a

3324
02:45:35,120 --> 02:45:36,770
salary.
You were messing with that fucking

3325
02:45:36,790 --> 02:45:37,601
grind.
You gotta wait,

3326
02:45:37,601 --> 02:45:38,440
you put out?
Yeah.

3327
02:45:38,441 --> 02:45:42,580
It's like an Olympic late slides in post
and it clamps down.

3328
02:45:42,640 --> 02:45:44,200
I thought maybe you rig that up
yourself.

3329
02:45:44,230 --> 02:45:44,861
No,
no,

3330
02:45:44,861 --> 02:45:46,220
they're selling it now.
It's their thing.

3331
02:45:46,360 --> 02:45:47,480
I saw that.
Yeah,

3332
02:45:47,481 --> 02:45:49,780
that I thought it was like you.
I thought you'd gone down to the

3333
02:45:49,781 --> 02:45:53,020
hardware store.
I knew I knew the frame,

3334
02:45:53,021 --> 02:45:55,600
but I didn't recognize the.
I know guys do it,

3335
02:45:55,601 --> 02:45:59,140
but usually they use sand bags,
put sand bags in their backpack and get

3336
02:45:59,141 --> 02:46:01,090
used to.
It makes a big difference and it's an

3337
02:46:01,091 --> 02:46:04,780
incredible work and it doesn't shift.
Doesn't shift at all and you really lock

3338
02:46:04,781 --> 02:46:06,520
it in place.
You don't have the risk of like

3339
02:46:07,040 --> 02:46:08,020
tweaking,
right?

3340
02:46:08,080 --> 02:46:10,010
Like it's strength,
but it's not.

3341
02:46:10,700 --> 02:46:12,800
Because when you shits wiggling around,
then it like,

3342
02:46:12,980 --> 02:46:14,550
I don't know if it doesn't really make
you stronger,

3343
02:46:14,560 --> 02:46:16,910
it makes you more inclined to like,
fuck something up and yeah.

3344
02:46:16,960 --> 02:46:18,170
To twist funny.
Yeah.

3345
02:46:18,171 --> 02:46:18,860
No,
I agree.

3346
02:46:18,860 --> 02:46:21,840
You know,
but I just think poor people just please

3347
02:46:21,860 --> 02:46:23,810
just,
just exercise your back,

3348
02:46:23,811 --> 02:46:26,930
treat it like it's like brushing your
teeth just to take yoga.

3349
02:46:27,210 --> 02:46:30,080
You don't have to take anything.
Just get some youtube videos.

3350
02:46:30,081 --> 02:46:31,970
They're free,
they're available everywhere.

3351
02:46:32,510 --> 02:46:34,250
Just do something to strengthen your
back.

3352
02:46:34,251 --> 02:46:36,530
You will prevent.
Most people don't want to listen to this

3353
02:46:36,531 --> 02:46:38,330
and they're not going to do it because
people are lazy as fuck.

3354
02:46:38,590 --> 02:46:42,950
But you will prevent a host of issues
that people have just by exercising your

3355
02:46:42,951 --> 02:46:44,730
back.
Simple stuff there.

3356
02:46:44,740 --> 02:46:46,480
There's the atlas trainer right there.
Yeah.

3357
02:46:46,490 --> 02:46:48,270
You could do chin ups on if you're a
fucking savage.

3358
02:46:48,270 --> 02:46:51,890
Like this guy is an animal.
But um,

3359
02:46:52,130 --> 02:46:54,200
yeah,
you could carry up to 90 pounds that

3360
02:46:54,201 --> 02:46:56,700
thing.
So it will take to a pedophile,

3361
02:46:56,720 --> 02:46:59,690
take 100 pound plates to under just
don't know if the plates designed for

3362
02:46:59,691 --> 02:47:01,370
it.
If the pack or others designed for it,

3363
02:47:01,490 --> 02:47:03,680
that's a good idea to do.
Pull up that sumbitch on.

3364
02:47:03,770 --> 02:47:05,390
Yeah.
I use a weight belt,

3365
02:47:06,140 --> 02:47:08,600
put like a belt and a hang a kettle bell
in between my legs.

3366
02:47:08,601 --> 02:47:11,880
I put a 50 pound Kettlebell on a chain
and I do chin ups like that.

3367
02:47:12,150 --> 02:47:15,650
Really?
That's hanging where it's right between

3368
02:47:15,651 --> 02:47:18,560
my legs,
like it's a big leather straps fall

3369
02:47:18,561 --> 02:47:22,370
across your legs in between the straps
on my back or my hip like this.

3370
02:47:22,520 --> 02:47:26,030
And then there's like a chain in between
my legs and the Kettlebell hangs in

3371
02:47:26,031 --> 02:47:28,130
which we might legs.
But it's not getting your scroll at all.

3372
02:47:28,190 --> 02:47:28,641
No,
no,

3373
02:47:28,641 --> 02:47:29,150
no,
no.

3374
02:47:29,150 --> 02:47:30,980
Swinging low swing.
It got gotta,

3375
02:47:30,981 --> 02:47:34,100
make sure your legs are separated so
it's not cracking against your knees,

3376
02:47:34,101 --> 02:47:37,520
but you know when you're doing chin ups,
it's just hanging there.

3377
02:47:37,580 --> 02:47:38,560
No Shit.
Yeah,

3378
02:47:38,720 --> 02:47:42,770
they say that that's the best way to get
more reps in with your chin ups is not

3379
02:47:42,771 --> 02:47:47,660
to try like 1920.
The actually the best way is do less,

3380
02:47:47,900 --> 02:47:50,450
but with heavy weights do like a,
you know,

3381
02:47:50,510 --> 02:47:54,710
put a weight vest on or hang a 70 pound
kettle bell in between your legs.

3382
02:47:54,830 --> 02:47:58,250
Just that three or four.
But again,

3383
02:47:58,670 --> 02:48:00,680
you run the risk of injury because it's
your.

3384
02:48:00,920 --> 02:48:03,110
Maybe that's why I've never done it.
Yeah,

3385
02:48:03,111 --> 02:48:05,300
you're putting a lot.
You've got to build yourself up to it,

3386
02:48:05,301 --> 02:48:06,860
you know,
that's what also one of the big things

3387
02:48:06,861 --> 02:48:09,410
that happens to people when they start
to exercise and they just try to go too

3388
02:48:09,411 --> 02:48:09,800
hard too.

3389
02:48:09,800 --> 02:48:12,020
They go to full balls is a,
as I remember,

3390
02:48:12,021 --> 02:48:12,531
uh,
uh,

3391
02:48:12,531 --> 02:48:15,710
various times not running for long time
and they'd be like,

3392
02:48:15,711 --> 02:48:16,840
yeah,
I'm going to start running and growing a

3393
02:48:16,850 --> 02:48:21,850
five mile run.
I've been running now for just a little

3394
02:48:21,861 --> 02:48:24,800
over a month.
I got a friend who's a runner and I'm

3395
02:48:25,010 --> 02:48:25,520
like,
he,

3396
02:48:25,520 --> 02:48:29,090
he's a hobbyist but runs marathons and
he never did before,

3397
02:48:29,630 --> 02:48:32,760
but he was saying
he was talking,

3398
02:48:32,780 --> 02:48:34,010
he wrote,
he's a writer,

3399
02:48:34,011 --> 02:48:36,770
so he's been writing about that a little
bit and he was saying he just wrote a

3400
02:48:36,771 --> 02:48:40,790
piece about
you don't run to get in shape.

3401
02:48:40,980 --> 02:48:42,350
You gotta get shaped.
Then start running.

3402
02:48:43,100 --> 02:48:45,570
Yeah,
that's a good idea to smart.

3403
02:48:45,580 --> 02:48:47,860
We say there's some steps.
There's some.

3404
02:48:47,990 --> 02:48:49,970
If you're just like a Slob,
right?

3405
02:48:50,480 --> 02:48:55,480
There's some things you need to get
taken care of before you embark on that

3406
02:48:56,030 --> 02:48:59,570
smart ground.
There's groundwork that needs to be done

3407
02:49:00,170 --> 02:49:01,430
to get ready for the run.

3408
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:03,980
I talked to.
I don't like to ever discourage people

3409
02:49:03,981 --> 02:49:06,410
from doing Jujitsu,
but I talked to a buddy of mine who just

3410
02:49:06,411 --> 02:49:11,411
did Jujitsu from.
He's 43 years of slaving behavior,

3411
02:49:12,900 --> 02:49:17,010
no exercise whatsoever other than the
occasional pickup basketball game for

3412
02:49:17,011 --> 02:49:19,680
like seven years,
and then he started doing Jujitsu and

3413
02:49:19,681 --> 02:49:21,090
immediately his body's falling apart.
I'm like,

3414
02:49:21,091 --> 02:49:23,340
okay,
I know this is going to be hard for you

3415
02:49:23,341 --> 02:49:25,740
to do,
but if you really want to do it,

3416
02:49:25,741 --> 02:49:30,690
you got to get in shape first.
Just start out with grassland and got

3417
02:49:30,710 --> 02:49:34,100
into our Rathlin.
Steven Rinella.

3418
02:49:34,110 --> 02:49:36,120
You got to get out of here at 3:15.
Listen man,

3419
02:49:36,121 --> 02:49:38,700
you got one of the best podcasts in the
world.

3420
02:49:38,730 --> 02:49:41,100
It's fucking awesome.
I love listening to it.

3421
02:49:41,101 --> 02:49:44,580
I'm so happy you do it and I think
you've got the best hunting show ever,

3422
02:49:44,670 --> 02:49:47,190
so I owe the podcast,
all of you,

3423
02:49:47,191 --> 02:49:47,850
Joe Rogan.

3424
02:49:47,850 --> 02:49:48,271
Well,
listen,

3425
02:49:48,271 --> 02:49:49,110
man,
hanging out with you.

3426
02:49:49,111 --> 02:49:50,760
Look so easy for you.
You,

3427
02:49:50,770 --> 02:49:53,070
you have so many great stories and you
such a good talker.

3428
02:49:53,071 --> 02:49:54,720
I was like,
how the fuck does this guy not have a

3429
02:49:54,721 --> 02:49:56,850
podcast?
I'm glad you steered me in that

3430
02:49:56,851 --> 02:49:57,720
direction.
Thanks for the plug.

3431
02:49:57,721 --> 02:50:00,510
I'm glad you're still doing it.
It's called a mediator podcast.

3432
02:50:00,511 --> 02:50:05,511
It's available everywhere and a mediator
is available on Netflix and uh,

3433
02:50:05,580 --> 02:50:07,830
right now it's only.
How many seasons do you get?

3434
02:50:08,060 --> 02:50:10,170
Five and six seasons.
Five and six.

3435
02:50:10,350 --> 02:50:11,910
Five there will will have more.
We've got more.

3436
02:50:11,911 --> 02:50:15,910
We got a dozen episodes that are new
that we're going to be released,

3437
02:50:15,960 --> 02:50:17,880
so just stay tuned and then I,
you know,

3438
02:50:17,940 --> 02:50:19,980
months ago,
back in a couple months ago,

3439
02:50:20,100 --> 02:50:21,930
if you go to my instagram,
Steven Rinella,

3440
02:50:21,931 --> 02:50:24,180
you'll scroll back and find a bunch of
pictures from.

3441
02:50:24,630 --> 02:50:26,520
You'll find a bunch of Guyana photos.
Yeah,

3442
02:50:26,521 --> 02:50:29,020
amazing stuff from Guyana,
but we never even talked about.

3443
02:50:29,040 --> 02:50:30,810
We did talk about that.
You'll find the pictures.

3444
02:50:31,110 --> 02:50:32,400
Good Times.
Thanks for doing this,

3445
02:50:32,401 --> 02:50:32,610
man.
