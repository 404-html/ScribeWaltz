1
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,910
Boom, ladies and gentlemen, Josh Barnett,
youngest ever UFC heavyweight champion,

2
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,250
and now we're retired.
Uh, sorta tired. Just, um,

3
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,050
I'm a free in the wind.
I'm like a Bald Eagle.

4
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:22,280
I'm just out there riding
on that freedom America,

5
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,380
just a,

6
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:24,470
uh,

7
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:29,470
I decided to leave the fold
of the UFC and a chase my,

8
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,090
my own futures by my own hands.

9
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:36,680
Are you actively competing or
going to be actively competing?

10
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,270
There'll be some grappling
stuff this year, but uh,

11
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:45,250
I'm figuring by the start of next year
I'll get back into the MMA circuits. Um,

12
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:49,390
mainly because it's just going to take
some time to set up camps, managers,

13
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:53,200
the structure of everything. I have a
proper sparring partners and all that.

14
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:54,361
And the meantime,

15
00:00:54,361 --> 00:00:57,180
we were talking about you're
doing commentary for new
Japan pro wrestling with

16
00:00:57,181 --> 00:01:00,370
Jim Ross and you do it on a access
TV, right? That's right. Okay.

17
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:02,160
Every Friday night at eight,
uh,

18
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:06,570
you can see me sit down and run
my mouth about wrassling. Yeah.

19
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:11,450
Uh, we just did a, the live show up
at the cow palace in San Francisco,

20
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:16,220
which they've been having
sporadic a wrestling events there.

21
00:01:16,221 --> 00:01:17,330
But it was a,

22
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:20,600
it was a big draw and that building
in like the 60s and seventies I guess.

23
00:01:20,601 --> 00:01:22,700
So it's a bit of a historical,

24
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:25,700
it feels like wrestling pro wrestler.
He's making a renaissance.

25
00:01:25,701 --> 00:01:28,300
It's like making a return. Yeah. I think

26
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:32,390
that um, there is a
certain audience of a, um,

27
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:37,790
of a certain age gap that our age group
that has come into flourishing in,

28
00:01:37,891 --> 00:01:42,010
in, into the Internet and other ways
to which to to go ahead and, and,

29
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:46,050
and bring wrestling back up
there and show that wrestling,

30
00:01:46,051 --> 00:01:50,090
whether it's the biggest company like
the WWE all the way to say, you know,

31
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,480
number two would be new Japan.

32
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:54,910
And then there's all these independent
companies all over the place that, uh,

33
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,820
some of them have quite
a decent following.

34
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:00,300
You know, uh, Billy Corgan from the
smashing pumpkins, huge wrestling fan.

35
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:04,380
He owns what, what is the company that
Nwa the national wrestling alliance? Yeah.

36
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:09,510
So he owns hard men. Nwa Is Nwa
the rap group. It's that too.

37
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,580
You mean?
That's what I hear when I hear Nwa.

38
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:16,420
I'm sure there's some attitude
involved. Gratitude, a Nwa. Think

39
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:20,860
about the rest of it,
but, uh, um, Nwa was,

40
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,270
is I guess it was, it's a legendary, um,

41
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:30,570
sanctioning body and so it wasn't any
one particular company, but it was a, um,

42
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,510
a sanctioning body that would
then oversee certain titles.

43
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,720
And so if you're going to be
on this show at this time,

44
00:02:37,721 --> 00:02:39,520
you're going to defend
the Nwa Championship.

45
00:02:39,521 --> 00:02:44,521
The NWA commission would get involved
and they had their specifications as to

46
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:48,550
how the title matches would be run
and whether or not you could lose by

47
00:02:48,551 --> 00:02:49,720
disqualification or not.

48
00:02:49,721 --> 00:02:53,410
Or if you go over the top rope would
be a DQ and little stuff like that.

49
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,150
Who did killer Kowalski? Russell for
killer Kowalski. I couldn't tell Ya.

50
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,070
Do you remember him?
I know the name but

51
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:04,850
I don't really, I mean school famous
trainer after the fact of it was,

52
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:09,610
yeah, when I was in high
school it was it ed doe.

53
00:03:09,611 --> 00:03:12,940
Yay. That's right. Did we talk about
that with Billy? I think we did.

54
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,080
He was like local cable when I was in
high school. It was like killing days,

55
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,430
like a claw. He would like grab his own
rest and ground your head or something.

56
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:26,110
Like a guy,
Eric,

57
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:29,260
look at his head,
he's got his hand up the claw.

58
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,880
It's like there's some nostalgia to it.

59
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:36,460
That's one of the reasons why
I feel like it's coming back.

60
00:03:36,461 --> 00:03:40,570
It's like people who liked it as a kid
or now as adults going back to it as a

61
00:03:40,571 --> 00:03:41,404
nostalgia,

62
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:42,521
the Internet,
it's,

63
00:03:42,521 --> 00:03:47,521
it's much easier to go out there and put
product out so it makes it more easily

64
00:03:49,421 --> 00:03:53,470
disseminated to any audience that might
want to see it. Especially with like a,

65
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:56,470
um, you know, shows that are abroad.

66
00:03:56,471 --> 00:04:00,910
Like there's some shows that'll go on
in Germany and Austria that we'll get

67
00:04:00,911 --> 00:04:02,980
streamed and people get ahold of them.
They get to watch them.

68
00:04:02,981 --> 00:04:05,430
So it's not like the tape
trading days of the, yes.

69
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,700
Does Jim Ross Hook you up with
his barbecue sauce? You know,

70
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,530
like he's got some fucking killer
barbecue. He's got this, he's got sauce,

71
00:04:13,531 --> 00:04:17,280
he's got rubs. He is,
he's got all kinds of, uh,

72
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:19,590
a whole menagerie of all your meat.

73
00:04:19,591 --> 00:04:22,140
Fixin's is he a pitmaster
is one of those dudes,

74
00:04:22,141 --> 00:04:25,790
does he do the whole thing with the wood
and I don't have, I don't know, smoker,

75
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,070
hickory chips. And then he's got
his, his white oak on the side.

76
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:34,200
One of them guys maybe. Maybe
he lost to my mind. Yeah. Yeah.

77
00:04:34,201 --> 00:04:37,290
There's like two types of people
that use like that barbecue.

78
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:40,920
There's people like me that you've
pellet grills, which is like infallible.

79
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:44,240
You know, I use one of those triggers.
Sure. It's easy for the Palestinian.

80
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,270
It does all the work for you,
but then there's a serious mother fuckers.

81
00:04:47,271 --> 00:04:50,310
You chop wood and dry it out
and they've got the Coleman.

82
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:55,010
There are those old or the uh, uh,
the ones that start with a w, uh,

83
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,610
the Weber grills that there's
just nothing to it other than,

84
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,620
oh, those are cattle grills.
Yeah. Those are for amateurs, Bro.

85
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:06,660
The real series dudes, they get those
side, those side smokers. Oh, sure.

86
00:05:06,661 --> 00:05:11,310
We have like the main chamber and then
you got a little wood box on the side

87
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:15,360
where the woods heating up and then the
air goes through and it smokes from this

88
00:05:15,361 --> 00:05:17,850
debt sales people that
cook and like to 25,

89
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:22,710
they never let anything that I
throw stuff over over a gas flames.

90
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:25,270
That's right. I was guiding my luddite. I,

91
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,560
I have no business having any,

92
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,080
any voice in the realm of barbecuing.

93
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:33,450
But it seems like something you'd
be interested in. I love it. And it,

94
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:36,300
it's just a man who was into
all things manly. This is true.

95
00:05:36,301 --> 00:05:38,520
And I like setting stuff
on fire and then eating it.

96
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,560
But you still drive a manual
transmission all around Los Angeles.

97
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:45,920
Just drove one today. Yeah.
Yeah, man. I just, uh, I, I've

98
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,180
been driving around, I just got it out
of the shop a little while ago. My,

99
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:54,080
I have a 75 formula a Firebird,
but instead of doing the ls swap,

100
00:05:54,081 --> 00:05:58,130
which everybody does, and I
understand why, uh, it's got a

101
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:01,550
four 55 Pontiac in it that we board.
I had a board 60 out.

102
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:06,710
It's got forged Pistons. Uh, I didn't
go with forged rods that didn't need it,

103
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:10,100
I think because, well no, actually I
did put fours rods and forged pistons.

104
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:15,460
But iron heads, dual quads will you
look at at uh, you know, I don't know.

105
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:20,910
The goal was to just make
maybe one horsepower per
cubic inch but have well over

106
00:06:21,111 --> 00:06:24,140
500 pound feet of torque.
That was the idea. And it's,

107
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,980
it's an automatic unfortunately.
Yeah.

108
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:29,990
Center for Sydney and we'll gives
me crap about that all the time.

109
00:06:29,991 --> 00:06:34,550
She's getting swamped out cause I like
just being able to drive it there at

110
00:06:34,551 --> 00:06:38,750
whole sun. Third hole on the floor.
But the clutch pedal in there, I'm,

111
00:06:38,751 --> 00:06:42,080
I'm more than down, but uh,
you know, hell, it needs paint.

112
00:06:42,081 --> 00:06:46,910
It needs interior done a, you
know, so Burt Reynolds car, right?

113
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:51,770
Is that the, you know, that's a 77.
Okay. You're 75 75, so it's got big,

114
00:06:51,771 --> 00:06:53,450
big hood scoop,
solar headlights,

115
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:56,900
a circular headlights,

116
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:01,660
still kind of a square round off,
rounded off square for the,

117
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,290
the center Jamie and pull it up.

118
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:07,820
You can pull up 75 Firebird and the
formula has the big Ram air scoops on it.

119
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:08,890
Right,
right.

120
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,380
Th th the to write the big snorkels
that come over the toes are dope.

121
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:17,060
There it is. Oops. That's a
transaction. And mine's a formula.

122
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,950
Ooh,
look at that car.

123
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:23,570
Like that yellow one on the
right or that gray one formula.

124
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:27,680
Oh. So I've been driving that around
quite a bit and Hotchkiss did all the

125
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:30,080
suspension on it. We'll
look, did the brakes.

126
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:35,210
It stops in a heartbeat.
That's a nice magnaflow exhaust.

127
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,540
That's one of the few cars that
I liked from 75. Like it feels,

128
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:43,340
I feel like everything after 71
it's real risky in a way. I mean,

129
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,810
some of the styling lines
of these mid seventies cars,

130
00:07:47,811 --> 00:07:51,830
I kind of like it in the
obnoxiousness of it all. But, uh,

131
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:55,640
and you know, whatever you
get with these as far as like,

132
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:59,150
so this car came with a 400,
the one that I bought and uh,

133
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:02,750
it was like seven and a half to one
compression. So it was just a total dog.

134
00:08:02,751 --> 00:08:07,190
People like, Hey, do burnouts. I'm like,
I wish, I wish that was the year that,

135
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:12,140
I mean the years where the gas crunch
was on and they started making these cars

136
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:15,410
gas efficient. Right. Well are
they attempted to in some way?

137
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:17,530
And not to mention they would.
Um,

138
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:21,370
they started trying to incorporate um,
uh,

139
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:25,520
Smaug uh, elements to try and reduce
the amount of smog, these things,

140
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:29,810
but they were just highly inefficient
the way we're going about it with the air

141
00:08:29,811 --> 00:08:32,870
stuff and different
processes that were like,

142
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:36,590
things connected to the heads
and it was bad news. Yeah.

143
00:08:36,591 --> 00:08:39,170
It was a rough time for America.
Don't have,

144
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,180
I know the rare of the rare times that
is right. Yeah. One of the rare times,

145
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,860
it was a rough time for cars,

146
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:49,970
like from 71 to the 80s
all through the 80s.

147
00:08:49,971 --> 00:08:53,300
We just make dog should cars made
some real, real, real snoozers.

148
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:56,100
Pontiac was one of the few
that was putting together a

149
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,980
decent looking car,
the Firebirds and the Trans Ams.

150
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:02,700
And then of course corvette Corvette's
still had some good looking cars in the

151
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:06,480
days they did. And especially because
they, even with the low horsepower motors,

152
00:09:06,481 --> 00:09:10,660
they, they're still liked cars. He can
still get up there and hustle to us. Yeah.

153
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:15,070
And then with even into like
77, 78, you had the 6.6 liter,

154
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:19,980
the 400 or the four oh three. I guess by
that point in the Pontiac's right now,

155
00:09:19,981 --> 00:09:23,910
chicks are turning off
their fucking radio in mass.

156
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:28,080
I don't know if any, any chicks wanted to
tune in to listen to what I had to say.

157
00:09:28,081 --> 00:09:32,010
Anyway. Come on, Bro. You're Josh Barnett.
Chicks wanna hear what you have to say.

158
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:35,700
They want to learn the ways of men,
the ways of men. They want to learn.

159
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:38,090
They want to it.
There's a lot of fake men surrounding,

160
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:42,060
there are a lot of fake make.
I have a theory that, uh,

161
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:46,200
so not that long ago, I, maybe
just a handful of years ago,

162
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:49,350
I finally got like a
leather biker style jacket.

163
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,750
And so Fonz kind of, yeah.
But Eh, and uh, oh ray,

164
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,410
every time, you know what, but every
time I smacked something electronic,

165
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:02,790
it doesn't work better. So there,
yeah. He had a magic touch. Absolutely.

166
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:07,410
The ladies loved him. Yeah.
Yeah. Keeps her dildos and shape.

167
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:10,220
But uh, he uh, or I,

168
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:13,890
so I got this jacket and I've always
wanted one ever since I was a kid and I

169
00:10:13,891 --> 00:10:17,430
went to this store in New
York because there was no,

170
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:21,000
there wasn't a location locally where
I could just try the jackets on and I

171
00:10:21,001 --> 00:10:24,270
didn't want to buy an expensive jacket
and have to send it all this stuff.

172
00:10:24,271 --> 00:10:27,960
So I was in New York, went to the store,
found the jacket that fit me, loved it,

173
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,180
bought it, been wearing the
ever living crap out of it,

174
00:10:30,181 --> 00:10:31,560
taking it all kinds of places.

175
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,310
It's been a nasty black
metal mosh pits with it on.

176
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,560
I've been all around the world with
it had been in far eastern Russia.

177
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:41,750
Leather jacket is made to tell a story
eventually at the end of it. Right.

178
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:47,130
But people will go, oh you know, do
you ride a bike? And I'm like, ah, no.

179
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:50,790
The reason why I have the jacket is
because of Mad Max, the road warrior.

180
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:55,590
Cause when I saw that as a kid,
those jackets look bad ass and you know,

181
00:10:55,591 --> 00:10:57,300
here's the bronze, the, the,

182
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:01,860
the MFP running around in their falcons
just tearing ass and blowing shit up

183
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:04,320
wearing these jackets. And I'm
like, I want a jacket like that.

184
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:09,780
But I started to notice that this jacket
was everywhere. Everywhere. Everybody,

185
00:11:09,781 --> 00:11:14,430
everybody was making a version of this
jacket somehow or some way this biker

186
00:11:14,431 --> 00:11:19,050
style jacket guys are wearing
it everywhere. Chicks are
wearing it everywhere.

187
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,360
And then I'm like, Huh,
that's a weird fashion trend.

188
00:11:21,361 --> 00:11:22,660
I didn't really see that comment.

189
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:25,320
And then as I started to think
about it more and more and more,

190
00:11:25,321 --> 00:11:30,321
it seems like there is a attempt within
society to try and present the image of

191
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:33,240
toughness,
right?

192
00:11:33,241 --> 00:11:38,010
So from haircuts to jackets to all
these different kinds of things that

193
00:11:38,011 --> 00:11:43,011
everyone's trying to appear to be
tough and bad ass all the time without,

194
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:48,030
but people aren't going out there and
necessarily risking it like they used to.

195
00:11:48,031 --> 00:11:51,570
They're not, they're not in
generally taking on these
jobs that are dangerous or,

196
00:11:51,571 --> 00:11:55,120
or even just your people
want to have muscle cars,

197
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:57,250
but they don't want to work on them.
They don't want to.

198
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:00,670
It's like by having the item,

199
00:12:00,671 --> 00:12:05,200
it somehow in implies some sort of
character. Yes. I'm sort of toughness,

200
00:12:05,201 --> 00:12:09,190
some sort of a rugged element to
yourself. Like, you know, I'm a bad ass,

201
00:12:09,191 --> 00:12:12,670
like you've gone through it. Right?
But you know, when that check at your,

202
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:17,140
fallen off your bike going 70 miles
an hour and just rolling and dusting

203
00:12:17,141 --> 00:12:20,380
yourself off and you'll
see all the, like, uh,

204
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:24,100
like the 30 year old Hollywood he type
dudes with the manicured beards and all

205
00:12:24,101 --> 00:12:28,970
that on their Harley's that have all
been turned into choppers and like, okay,

206
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:33,640
it's like a, uh, a big
show of toughness without,

207
00:12:33,641 --> 00:12:35,560
because people aren't going out there and,

208
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,410
and living tough lives anymore toughness,

209
00:12:38,411 --> 00:12:41,230
or is it coolness and are
they the same things? It's,

210
00:12:41,231 --> 00:12:45,520
I think it's a coolness related to
the idea of being tough and attempted

211
00:12:45,521 --> 00:12:47,860
authenticity. Correct. And I, you know,

212
00:12:47,861 --> 00:12:52,690
to use a term masculinity,
right. And even though, uh,

213
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,000
a woman that's a appearing to be tough.
I mean,

214
00:12:55,001 --> 00:12:58,180
you would call it a masculine trait even
though that doesn't mean that they're

215
00:12:58,181 --> 00:13:00,830
being a man. She's putting
out a signal, right? A,

216
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:03,760
a chick that wears like a
leather jacket and rides a bike.

217
00:13:03,761 --> 00:13:05,410
She's putting out a signal like,

218
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:09,540
you better be a bad motherfucker if you
want this bitch or I'm going to girls.

219
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:11,630
Maybe it's one of those

220
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:19,000
previous could still apply
to the ladder, but, uh, it's,

221
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:22,840
it's like, um, you know, I'm a bad
motherfucker. All right. Whatever.

222
00:13:22,841 --> 00:13:25,600
Whatever vibe you're trying to put out
there. And then you go and you're like,

223
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:30,100
well, okay, what's bad motherfucker
about you? I don't take no shit. Yeah,

224
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:33,130
sure you do. Hey Bro, don't take
any shit. My agent calls me.

225
00:13:33,131 --> 00:13:34,060
I tell him to fuck off.

226
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:40,810
I walked in, I nailed that audition. I
didn't even have any product in my hair.

227
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:44,920
I don't give a fuck. You don't
know me, man. I'm different.

228
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,850
It's just a, it's just a little, it's a
casual observation is totally anecdotal,

229
00:13:48,851 --> 00:13:53,830
but it just seems like people are
attempting to try and it's like things I

230
00:13:53,831 --> 00:13:56,970
always tell people about looking
at human history, I go the, the,

231
00:13:56,971 --> 00:14:00,600
the issues that we deal with,
the things that affect us or not new,

232
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:03,310
it's just in a lot of ways
are just more magnified there,

233
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:05,660
especially with social media.
Um,

234
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:11,140
social media I believe like picks and
preys on certain elements of our way of

235
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:15,520
being, our process. Uh, and it, and it
heightens our responses to certain things,

236
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:20,521
but it also heightens what we see from
these responses because when somebody is,

237
00:14:21,431 --> 00:14:23,380
let's say,
massively insecure,

238
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:26,920
so social media can really pray,

239
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:29,920
help play hell on that and
make you feel more insecure,

240
00:14:29,921 --> 00:14:31,120
especially if you're putting,

241
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,860
depending on where you're putting value
on what you see or what is said about

242
00:14:35,861 --> 00:14:40,420
you or how you, or necessarily if
you're comparing yourself to others.

243
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:45,550
Also when you respond to that in some
way through your own social media,

244
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:50,920
be it by trying to take more grandiose
photos or, or, or, I don't know,

245
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:52,010
whatever sort of

246
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:55,250
signaling of,
of how to make up for that,

247
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,950
it shines even that much
more to everybody else.

248
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:04,210
So what you do get seen as much as you
see what everybody else does and then

249
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:08,810
you're given an option on how do you
react to that? Well, if you're not,

250
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,790
I mean these are the sort of that you
can go back into old books on philosophy

251
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:15,860
and uh, you know, old historical texts.

252
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,980
Insecurity is not going anywhere.

253
00:15:18,981 --> 00:15:23,981
We're not any all that much more different
from a thousand years of 2000 years

254
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:28,550
or 3000 years. And the way we react
and respond to things than we are now.

255
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:31,580
It's just that all these
things are amplified under the,

256
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:36,140
the elements of technology that are around
us and how they can affect us and how

257
00:15:36,141 --> 00:15:39,680
much easier it is for that,
for those things to get to us know,

258
00:15:39,681 --> 00:15:44,540
radically amplified. I mean I see people
fighting with people on Instagram,

259
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,950
you know, see people fighting
with the commentors. Yes.

260
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:51,860
If someone posts something and then other
people shit on them and then they take

261
00:15:51,861 --> 00:15:56,000
their posts and comment on that and you've
got to go with this is like hours of

262
00:15:56,001 --> 00:15:56,834
your day man,

263
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,640
and people just sniping at you for the
clothes you're wearing or your fake lips

264
00:16:01,641 --> 00:16:04,730
or whatever it is something, right. And
you, you, you could say, well, you know,

265
00:16:04,731 --> 00:16:07,730
you've got the person who's got,
who's turned their,

266
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:12,500
their social media into a very self
absorbed sort of a platform. Right.

267
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:17,990
That's a lot. And then even in amongst
that, it's like, well, I mean to a degree,

268
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:22,160
if it's your social media and you
are the prime element within it,

269
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,150
of course it would be a bit self absorbed.
But yeah.

270
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:28,160
But I think there's more
nuance to it than that.

271
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,470
And it's not just to pick on say,
you know,

272
00:16:30,471 --> 00:16:33,890
the gals that are taking all the sexy
selfies and all that kind of stuff.

273
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:38,920
There's the dudes that do essentially
the same equivalent and it's all in a,

274
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:42,590
you know, often it can be in a response
to drive attention towards themselves,

275
00:16:42,591 --> 00:16:45,860
but what do you, why do you want
that attention in the first place?

276
00:16:45,861 --> 00:16:48,170
And then of course that's something
that you can't know until you know the

277
00:16:48,171 --> 00:16:51,710
person. Exactly. Well a lot of girls
make a living off of it. Yeah, 100% yeah.

278
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:56,540
There's a lot of girls that they do like
sponsored tweets or sponsored Instagram

279
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:57,560
posts at once.

280
00:16:57,561 --> 00:17:02,310
They can get foods are making a living
off of Instagram that way for like that

281
00:17:02,311 --> 00:17:03,081
got famous.

282
00:17:03,081 --> 00:17:06,980
Like for girls it's like girls with big
asses and there's one girl that I just

283
00:17:06,981 --> 00:17:10,460
started following her whole
Instagram was her ass.

284
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,690
I mean that is it man. I was thinking
I was a terrible thing to think,

285
00:17:14,691 --> 00:17:17,720
but I was thinking of a dog ever came over
and bit her ass. She'd be out of work.

286
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:21,430
That's it. It's fucked up.
She's have an arking spray of,

287
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:23,480
of fucking jail shooting out of her house.

288
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:28,100
He should have Kevlar pants on everywhere
she goes. That ass Lloyd's of London.

289
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:31,040
I have a, what will you give
me per cheek on insurance.

290
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:33,530
I mean she has a tremendous ass,
don't get me wrong,

291
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,080
but it's just weird when
there's this like one,

292
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:40,640
here's body part that essentially
defines your identity.

293
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,400
Like this essentially does, which,
which is weirder, that great ass though.

294
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:49,720
This person with this fantastic
monumental epic level ass is out

295
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:53,220
there taking photos of it and putting
it out there for people to see or that

296
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:58,320
people not only continue to look
at it but more flock to this.

297
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:02,190
This a religious icon of
an ass apparently. Yeah.

298
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:07,020
Well it doesn't get old apparent. It
never gets old. No, it's not for dudes.

299
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:11,310
I mean for girls. Is there like one
bar? I guess it's abs isn't abs?

300
00:18:11,311 --> 00:18:14,340
Like what is the one body I
turned to Jamie. Jamie, yeah. Hey,

301
00:18:14,341 --> 00:18:18,880
tell us about what the girls are
for girls until wallet.

302
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:23,790
Look how fat as well. And this
is kind, kinda fat wallet. But,

303
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:24,624
uh,

304
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,950
well on also it wouldn't be surprised
that the women in terms of that,

305
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:33,000
that kind of shallow aspect of
social media in that way could,

306
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:35,340
could make more impact out of it.

307
00:18:35,341 --> 00:18:38,970
Because even when you look
at say all the men's Mag,

308
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,400
all the women's magazines and all that
kind of stuff and like women want to look

309
00:18:41,401 --> 00:18:44,970
at how women, right. So women
are even driven to look at,

310
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,520
and we're of course obviously
driven to look at hot women. Well,

311
00:18:47,521 --> 00:18:51,510
women know about filters too. Like, oh,
this bitch is using filters. Look at her.

312
00:18:51,511 --> 00:18:54,690
That is not what she looks like. And then
when we got, she looks like a cartoon.

313
00:18:54,691 --> 00:18:55,460
Sure enough,

314
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:58,010
look at her face and then they're trying
to find out what filter that was. Well,

315
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:02,390
it felt beauty filter. What
Cameron did she use? Yeah. If, uh,

316
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,550
if girls found out that there was
like one camera that really did it,

317
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,060
they would be, every girl would use
that one phone that has that one camera.

318
00:19:09,061 --> 00:19:12,660
Exactly. They nailed it. I guess
they're all pretty good now.

319
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:16,980
But if there was like one standout
phone that took better selfies,

320
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:19,080
like that would be the one that they used.
Oh,

321
00:19:19,081 --> 00:19:24,081
it would be a marketing avalanche
towards that demographic for sure.

322
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,980
Your rear phone, like if you have
a phone, the camera on the back.

323
00:19:28,981 --> 00:19:30,990
It's always more powerful
than the selfie camera.

324
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:35,940
That's a bigger lens and
for chicks, that's fucking
bullshit. Like they need it.

325
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:40,260
They need a good reverse.
The other way I need like multiple lenses.

326
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:43,130
You can choose which one you
need. They're like, I know it.

327
00:19:43,131 --> 00:19:45,090
My friends look like I see them.

328
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,840
I want to see myself selfie sticks.

329
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:51,960
If there was dudes only dudes on the
planet, they'd be no selfie sticks.

330
00:19:51,961 --> 00:19:56,070
That shit would've never been invented.
You don't think so? No. If we found,

331
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:59,040
if it was only men and we,
we found a guy with a selfie stick,

332
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:02,680
that would be the guy we fucked.
I called them down all the way down.

333
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:06,100
What is this? Is this, did you get
injured? Is this a walking stick?

334
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:08,490
Is a portable baton in
case you get attacked?

335
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:12,750
Are you using that to take photos inside
of a bear cave because you got about to

336
00:20:12,751 --> 00:20:15,920
go in, do you want to make sure you know
where the Grizzly is? Are you a, you know,

337
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:18,450
putting that thing around corners
to see where that rabbit is? Yeah.

338
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:21,030
Is that what you're doing? Because
if not, I've got a problem with this.

339
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:27,990
When my arms are short lucky dudes with
selfie sticks, that is a dark thing.

340
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:30,480
There's something about it
like holding it up. Hey,

341
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:36,950
I'm in front of a Blob of why, why
is it, why is that even bottom?

342
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:37,950
It doesn't even make any sense.

343
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,520
Like why is it okay for me to take
a Selfie with a regular Selfie Lens?

344
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:45,570
But it's a problem if a dude as
a selfie stick. I don't know,

345
00:20:45,571 --> 00:20:49,750
I just seems a bit obnoxious perhaps.
Well,

346
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:54,100
it seems that way. I can't say that I
have a reason why it makes sense. Make me,

347
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:57,400
hey, maybe it's simply because we
view it as something that, that,

348
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:00,520
or we see women do it
more. And so we, we, uh,

349
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:04,110
think that a man is somehow doing
something. Well, it's like mainly,

350
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:08,560
I don't know if a man gets fillers in
his face ever see like a older dude to

351
00:21:08,561 --> 00:21:11,780
gets fillers in his face. He's like,
Bro, I didn't want to pull them aside.

352
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,610
Come here. I'm sure I have. Yeah,
you want to go? No, just don't,

353
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,670
you're going to be wrinkled. This
is just it. You're 65 years old.

354
00:21:18,671 --> 00:21:23,290
You've got to let it go. And the headache,
it's letting go on its own anyways.

355
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:27,100
But some, some gals can kind of pull
it off and you feel bad for them,

356
00:21:27,101 --> 00:21:30,790
but they still kind of pretty, so you
let it go. You know, personally myself,

357
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:33,130
I'm not really all that into the,

358
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:36,580
especially manipulating the
face like that and for anyone,

359
00:21:36,581 --> 00:21:41,440
I just think that it's, it's one the
potential for it to go really badly,

360
00:21:41,441 --> 00:21:45,510
real beds there. And two, it
just, I think that people, um,

361
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:49,740
you don't have to look perfect
to be a beautiful person. Yeah.

362
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:51,123
Your personality,

363
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:55,840
your personality is at least as
important as the way you look.

364
00:21:56,110 --> 00:22:01,110
And if your personality is such that you
need to shoot plastic in your face in

365
00:22:03,581 --> 00:22:06,370
order to feel good about yourself,
you know, I've got to go, Ooh,

366
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:09,590
like what's happened in their
bone below the surface. The,

367
00:22:09,591 --> 00:22:13,630
it could be a indicator of
something more serious that,

368
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:17,180
that no matter how much filler,
how nice it could look maybe there,

369
00:22:17,181 --> 00:22:20,650
there's still gonna be an issue per se.
It's also one of those things,

370
00:22:20,651 --> 00:22:24,070
just like anorexia or bodybuilders that
can never get big enough where they have

371
00:22:24,071 --> 00:22:27,600
body dysmorphia, people don't know
what they really look like. Do you,

372
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,940
do you know about the FIBONACCI
sequence? Uh, the numbers, right?

373
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:35,950
It's the golden ratio.
It actually applies to facial features.

374
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:37,210
See if you can find something on that.

375
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,390
And now there was one of
the sea documentary on that,
right? And at the time,

376
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:40,900
as I thought,

377
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:45,100
and there was something about symmetry
and Elizabeth Hurley when they made that

378
00:22:45,101 --> 00:22:48,810
thing was considered one of the most
beautiful women in the world by the

379
00:22:48,811 --> 00:22:51,730
[inaudible], by the mathematics of
it all. She's still one of them.

380
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:55,750
I don't doubt it. Yeah. That checks like
88 years old. She's still hot as fuck.

381
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:58,330
She's rocking it.
Um,

382
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:02,560
but there's something about
the way your face is shaped.

383
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:07,150
Um, your, you're like a good
example is my friend Ari Shaffir.

384
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:11,290
Ari has a thin face in a long
nose and it all works together.

385
00:23:11,291 --> 00:23:15,310
Like if he had my nose on his
face, it would be like, hey,

386
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,960
the fuck's wrong with your face.

387
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:22,960
But the ratios of the width of his
face and the length of his nose,

388
00:23:22,961 --> 00:23:26,920
the size of his eyes, all that
stuff, somehow or another syncs up.

389
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:30,060
So you're saying it's not that any one
thing, it's the sum of your parts. Yes.

390
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,980
It's all those things go together.
And if one of them is off,

391
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:36,160
like say if your hair is
golden ratio on the face.

392
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:41,310
So if you are a black woman
and you have white lips,

393
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,300
like a white woman's lips,

394
00:23:43,301 --> 00:23:46,280
people like what the fuck is
going on with even whistle, right?

395
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:49,850
She's got a large nose or
a wide nose and you know,

396
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:54,080
my grow this facial hair, no,
hide my skinny little skinny lips.

397
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:57,880
I can platelets lips. You got Viking
lips, Bro. I haven't been told that I've,

398
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:00,350
this is a, I've had some
girls go, man, you're,

399
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:04,470
you're actually in way better kiss or
than I expected because you have almost,

400
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:07,730
it seems like you have no lips. I'm
like, ah. Do you know the good, the bad?

401
00:24:07,731 --> 00:24:12,080
Someone told Kylie Jenner and that's
why she got facial stuff. Yeah,

402
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:14,630
I was reading that today.
This is what kind of a loser I am.

403
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:19,130
50 year old man with children. I fucking
pay taxes. I got a lot of shit to do.

404
00:24:19,131 --> 00:24:19,461
Meanwhile,

405
00:24:19,461 --> 00:24:23,240
I'm reading some article about why Kylie
Jenner decided to take all the filler

406
00:24:23,241 --> 00:24:26,900
out of her face. It was a fucking article
on my Google feed and it was like,

407
00:24:26,901 --> 00:24:31,100
what is this? They know what
you're into. I guess they do.

408
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:34,040
I don't know how they've got your
name tag. They signs of pitches.

409
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:37,220
How do they know they know the
inner workings of Joe Rogan?

410
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,490
We'll fill her is a fairly
recent thing in human history.

411
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,770
I mean I'm not long as I've been
around Billy with it. I mean,

412
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:46,910
I don't proclaim to be too much of a
know what's in it. What is filler? Well,

413
00:24:46,911 --> 00:24:51,560
it's okay. Let's facial filler. Google
that. What's in facial filler sand?

414
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:55,580
A JB weld. Pando gorilla come. Yeah.

415
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:59,120
Probably depending on how
high a grade it is or,

416
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:02,050
and there's the freshness levels.
The gorilla club.

417
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:05,780
Does it feel like if they touch your
face and you've got some shit and then it

418
00:25:05,781 --> 00:25:06,614
makes your cheeks,

419
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:10,340
some girls look like they got rocked
like their cheeks injectable fillers for

420
00:25:10,341 --> 00:25:15,150
the face. Oh Jesus. A
hydraulic hyaluronic acid. No.

421
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,800
Siena college in a hyaluronic acid are
both going to get absorbed into your

422
00:25:18,801 --> 00:25:20,030
system eventually.
Yeah.

423
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:24,050
I think that's the good part
about it is that it's temporary.

424
00:25:24,051 --> 00:25:27,110
And then if you just let your
body raising scour depressions,

425
00:25:27,111 --> 00:25:32,111
enhancing lips and replacing soft tissue
volume loss through facial injections.

426
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:37,250
Hmm. Huh. Enhancing Lips,
Huh? Hmm. Get it done.

427
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,520
But that's why it looks weird with girls
when they have big fake lips because of

428
00:25:40,521 --> 00:25:44,900
the golden ratio. Your face
doesn't, it just doesn't work.

429
00:25:44,901 --> 00:25:49,010
Like go back to that article on the golden
ratio of the face, please. And you'll,

430
00:25:49,011 --> 00:25:50,840
you'll see like they have a,

431
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:56,140
there's a whole mathematical sort of
algorithm that they can use to short sort

432
00:25:57,471 --> 00:25:58,130
of,
uh,

433
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:03,130
explain what is and is not
normal in the shape of your face.

434
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:07,790
Like look at um, what the
fuck's his name? Angelina Jolie.

435
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:11,960
You remember that song?
There was a fucking song that someone,

436
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:17,420
there was a song, God
dammit. This is like 2002

437
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:23,420
some like it was a song was Angelina
Jolie got some big ass titties,

438
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:28,670
the name of the song. It was that a big
Larry as that was, that was that top 40.

439
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:32,270
I'm not amongst me and my stupid
fucking friends. It was we, it was,

440
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:35,360
it was a funny song. Like the
dude who sang it. Is that,

441
00:26:35,361 --> 00:26:40,100
is that funny sober as well or that's
a good question and you'd have to ask

442
00:26:40,101 --> 00:26:40,934
somebody else.

443
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,360
Those are the years from the,

444
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,510
from 2001 I was doing
fear of fact is that it

445
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,750
suggested to be

446
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:00,100
stating the obvious,
is that the name?

447
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:03,860
Yes. It's got some pig ass
it, it's such, it's so stupid.

448
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:09,100
From 2000 to two somewhere around
2007 I think I was high every day.

449
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:14,770
It's all a blur. It's just the, it's
just like driving through fog. I would,

450
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:18,500
I was so bored where I was
doing fear factor. The only
way I enjoyed it, I was by,

451
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:19,180
you weren't,

452
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:22,850
you weren't enjoying all eating pig
anuses and people screaming about having a

453
00:27:22,851 --> 00:27:25,940
centipede on their head and
after a while it got bored.

454
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:29,630
He got me get desensitized to it.
It just didn't, it just can't watch

455
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:34,750
general porn anymore. Right. It's like
if there's not a robot right in there,

456
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:38,590
you know, having sex with a
tiger while a midget films,

457
00:27:38,591 --> 00:27:40,750
it was clearly that stuff does happen.
Right?

458
00:27:40,751 --> 00:27:43,000
Like this is a reason
why people like gag porn.

459
00:27:43,001 --> 00:27:47,830
Was it rule 34 if there's not
a point of it that, uh, it,

460
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,450
there's,
if you can think of it,

461
00:27:49,451 --> 00:27:54,070
there's a porn out there and 35 is if it
doesn't exist, it shall be made. Yeah,

462
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:57,490
that makes sense. It's a four Chan thing.
Not that I'm a fortunate all the time,

463
00:27:57,491 --> 00:27:58,530
but, well, someone's got to

464
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,470
on all account.

465
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,390
There's something about like people
getting desensitized that's fucking

466
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:09,130
absolutely real. And that's one of
the reasons why, like in times of war,

467
00:28:09,131 --> 00:28:12,760
people are capable of doing
more and more awful shit.

468
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:15,760
It's like you get desensitized,
you get normalized.

469
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,250
Like people are very malleable, you get
accustomed to all sorts of things. Yeah.

470
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:24,640
Some of those things don't necessarily
stay forever. They're, they're subjective,

471
00:28:24,641 --> 00:28:26,410
you know, for that, that
time and that moment.

472
00:28:26,411 --> 00:28:29,680
And plus there is everything that's
going around you. And, and if,

473
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:32,910
if we're all in here and we're
saying we're drinking coffee,

474
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:34,480
we think that this is the way to be.

475
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:37,390
And then other foot everyone else
out and around us and like, well,

476
00:28:37,391 --> 00:28:38,560
they're all drinking energy drinks,

477
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:40,700
energy drinks are actually
the best thing to do. Ah,

478
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,900
well now there's this other thing that
you see that in perhaps then that bleeds

479
00:28:43,901 --> 00:28:47,770
into what, oh no, let's do energy drinks
instead. Yeah. And if you go from that to,

480
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:52,720
you know, let's drink a grain alcohol,
well maybe not the bill could be. Yeah.

481
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:56,230
I mean, sure. People just imitate
their atmosphere will show and,

482
00:28:56,231 --> 00:29:01,120
and if someone else is, you know,
God and war, if they take one year,

483
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:05,260
your your teammates and then cut them
to pieces and send them back to you,

484
00:29:05,261 --> 00:29:09,370
then all of a sudden, yeah, you're going
to do the same events. Some, you know,

485
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:14,200
reprisal. Yeah. Yeah. There
I used to know dude who, uh,

486
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:18,060
he was a Mormon and Mormons aren't
allowed to drink coffee. Well,

487
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,440
I thought you were going to go somewhere
else, but I knew he was a Mormon.

488
00:29:20,441 --> 00:29:22,840
He used to cut people a piece in the
center. No, he didn't do any of that,

489
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:26,940
I don't think. Well, I mean, Mormons,
they're just so friendly. Yeah. There's,

490
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:30,150
there's something got to be going on
underneath. Somethings there's a trigger.

491
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:33,580
You've got to find it.
But to put the hole in there,

492
00:29:33,581 --> 00:29:35,800
they get a hole in their magic
underwear and they're just, that's it.

493
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:39,550
But I would fucking place down, I offered
him a cup of coffee and he's like, no,

494
00:29:39,551 --> 00:29:42,070
uh, I can't drink coffee. And he had

495
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:45,640
a fucking, one of those huge monster
energy drink. Seriously. Yeah.

496
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:49,390
He was drinking them all day long to
the point where he was having heart

497
00:29:49,391 --> 00:29:53,020
problems. He's kidding.
Fucking hard palpitations.

498
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:56,990
He was drinking. Oh No, it wasn't,
wasn't monsters. It was rock stars.

499
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,510
I wonder which one has more
caffeine if I know what you want to.

500
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:04,210
I think Raj mark has more caffeine
than a monster. Monster is doable.

501
00:30:04,211 --> 00:30:08,980
Like I drink, I'll drink a sugar free
monster during UFC broadcasts at times.

502
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:12,700
I drink those during the, uh, the
new Japan shows if four hours. Yeah.

503
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:15,550
But the problem is you've got to Piss.
There's whatever's in there,

504
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:18,760
goes right to your system. I
use caffeine. Ain't helping.

505
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:22,420
Goldberg used to drink those fucking
things like they were water and he was

506
00:30:22,421 --> 00:30:23,254
always pinging.

507
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:26,470
Both monster and Rockstar have the
same amount of caffeine per serving,

508
00:30:26,471 --> 00:30:30,460
which is eight 80 milligrams per
eight ounces. Yeah, but what?

509
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:34,210
Haiti is not that. Wow. That's crazy.

510
00:30:34,211 --> 00:30:38,950
That's our list as being two 40 at or
something around there at the whole can

511
00:30:38,951 --> 00:30:43,720
and monster list as being one
32. This is to 70 G. Whoa.

512
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:46,430
See if she had these little bad
boys or two. Seven. God dammit.

513
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:50,280
Tate trying to give you kind of
made me jump out of his chair case.

514
00:30:50,281 --> 00:30:51,940
Trying to take,
try to give people heart attacks.

515
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:59,410
Shadow Tait Fletcher. Shout out to take
Fletcher and caveman coffee. Yeah. Um,

516
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:04,590
there's uh, people are weird with trends,
right? Like whatever the fuck happened.

517
00:31:04,591 --> 00:31:07,030
The acid wash jeans.
I was thinking that the other day.

518
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,360
Like people used to
love acid washed jeans.

519
00:31:09,361 --> 00:31:12,330
You remember they'd walk around with
genes was all sports all over them.

520
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:16,030
I think they're kind of making a bit of
a comeback. Yeah. It's like fanny packs.

521
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:19,810
Yup. And and and have the same, you were
ahead of the curve way ahead of curve.

522
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:24,840
I never left. You're basically a late
eighties pro wrestler. Yeah. Right. Like,

523
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:29,380
oh Cogan like all Gogan like, yeah,
right here. Ladies and gentlemen.

524
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:33,190
This pitch never left my side. All
leather never left my side. This is real.

525
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:36,510
It was made from a big horn sheep
that you, a, you tracked down.

526
00:31:36,511 --> 00:31:39,250
I shot with an Arrow.
I should get one made.

527
00:31:39,251 --> 00:31:40,900
I've got these access
deer hides out there.

528
00:31:40,901 --> 00:31:43,960
I should get one turn into a fanny pack.
That'd be dope. Please. Before on it.

529
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:48,970
Fuck yeah. Right. Yeah. Hope
you don't get any ticks. No,

530
00:31:48,971 --> 00:31:51,460
there's no kicks on those.
I don't think they have ticks in Hawaii.

531
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,020
It's weird,
you know.

532
00:31:56,021 --> 00:31:59,710
But that's the thing about paradigms
is you don't really realize it when the

533
00:31:59,711 --> 00:32:02,430
paradigm is over until you're out of it.
Right?

534
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:05,440
So we're in a paradigm
now of some sort and,

535
00:32:05,441 --> 00:32:09,420
and it's easy to get lost in that
and not be able to see outside of,

536
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:13,360
what do you think is happening now
that will be ridiculed in the future?

537
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,450
Um, tough. I mean,

538
00:32:16,451 --> 00:32:19,900
I didn't think that in a lot of ways
we would end up to where we are at this

539
00:32:19,901 --> 00:32:20,490
point and,

540
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:25,060
and so many of the social and cultural
elements and that didn't even just

541
00:32:25,061 --> 00:32:29,950
specifically stay within the u s but
seem to be bleeding throughout all of

542
00:32:29,951 --> 00:32:34,020
western society and civilization at large.
Um,

543
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:39,330
I've got one word Yeezys
Yeezys Yeezys be marked

544
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:44,840
with that says that's a shoe,
right? That's just for Jamie.

545
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:49,190
He loves those fucking things. He bought
me a pair. I won't wear them. I told them,

546
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:52,190
next time I go running in the creeks,
I'm going to wear them.

547
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:57,930
Jamie loves these goddamn things,
so I'm not going to hit this.

548
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:03,890
It's still got the foam thing in that bro.
Put them on. Nope. Yeezys that come on.

549
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:08,540
That looks like a sneaker from the
80s. Right. I wouldn't even say that.

550
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,900
We'll just say this by the way. You're
talking to a real man here. That's okay.

551
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:17,270
I understand this and understand this.
Is that just like the bottom of a,

552
00:33:17,271 --> 00:33:18,170
of a fucking

553
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:24,200
mailman form Styrofoam Coleman coolers.

554
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:29,730
It's the bottom part. The
ultra boost. Ultra boost.

555
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:33,740
What is this? This is like a
glorified fucking water sock.

556
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:37,570
This is like the thing, you
see some, some doofus with a,

557
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:40,700
those frog skin things on his
glasses to keep him from falling.

558
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:45,650
Always wandering around in the, you
know, I don't want to get too wet.

559
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:49,140
So you wouldn't wear those? No. Weird.

560
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:54,000
I wear weird how manly
men where these cars.

561
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:58,320
I wear chuck Taylors custom
chucks. Fuck yeah. With uh, my,

562
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:01,960
my logo on the side. I was drawn
by Dan prenotion. Look at that. Uh,

563
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:06,840
skulls and shit. God Damn dirty. Stinky
Chuck. I wear black metal tee shirts.

564
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:11,780
Fuck yeah. Look at that. See that? Chuck's
got damp classics. Jamie, not this.

565
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:15,170
What is this a fuck's going on here?
It's comfort.

566
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:17,750
I bet they're comfortable as
fuck. Right? They feel like soft.

567
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:20,210
They're like crocs while
I'm wearing. I'm like, damn,

568
00:34:20,211 --> 00:34:23,160
I should probably put these on
when no one's looking. God Damn.

569
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:27,860
He's like being like, you're just
wearing Angelina Jolie's titties. Right?

570
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:33,540
It's a big ass holes. Yeah,
they look comfortable. Pitch.

571
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:38,420
I could see JP and some, what's
that jacket? See Jp and some Yeezys.

572
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,270
Jp Jordan Peterson.
Peterson easy. Oh yeah.

573
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:46,510
I could see him wearing some atrocious
sandals and no one's looking like,

574
00:34:46,821 --> 00:34:51,560
whoa man. You'd have to talk to him to
do, to do good. Take those off with a,

575
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:54,220
we hit with like some wool socks on.
Yeah.

576
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:57,080
Jamie and I were talking
about this the other day.

577
00:34:57,081 --> 00:35:01,990
You're allowed to wear socks with slides.
Slides,

578
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,650
so there's no,
there's no toe.

579
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:09,980
You're allowed w who says guys wear
them all time. Fuck that noise.

580
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:17,650
The fuck is that about? I
don't know. It's a thing loud.

581
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,290
No, it's not allowed guys
wear them all the time.

582
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:21,740
Keep your socks out of your sandals.

583
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:25,480
We were just in Vegas and there was
some basketball thing going on there.

584
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:30,310
There was a bunch of basketball players,
half of them slides with socks.

585
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:35,300
Here's the deal with that though.
It's, I can at least say as an athlete,

586
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:35,451
they,

587
00:35:35,451 --> 00:35:38,040
maybe they've got the slides on because
they're going to take those sides off and

588
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:42,210
put their basketball shoes right on.
So for them it's like, I'm uh, I'm,

589
00:35:42,211 --> 00:35:44,040
I'm out of uniform at the moment.

590
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:49,080
I'm ready to go to combat basketball
wise at any moment. I don't know.

591
00:35:49,081 --> 00:35:53,580
But in general, as far as a fashion trend,
fuck that noise. But it looks ridiculous

592
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:57,580
amongst like rappers. I see rappers
wearing those things with socks,

593
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,900
it just looks like he just,

594
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:04,000
I dunno, like you given up. Yeah, kind of
money. Just wear sweatpants all day too.

595
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:07,200
Like you're a dude with a wife beater
with your gut hanging out of the bottom of

596
00:36:07,201 --> 00:36:08,570
it and you just fucking kicked it back.

597
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:09,400
Fuck it.
I'd only,

598
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:14,230
I can't even bend over and tie my
shoes class to the velcro on my Yeezys.

599
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:18,580
Yeah, yeah. They don't velcro do that.

600
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:23,080
Well, you know, I guess, I guess you
don't need a real shoe. If you throw on,

601
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:24,640
you walk out with your socks on,

602
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:28,400
you throw on your sliders and get on
your hoverboard are fucking what your

603
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:29,740
electric scooter

604
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:32,490
me.
Would you ever drive a Tesla?

605
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:37,380
Uh, I would drive a Tesla.
Uh, but you know, here's,

606
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:40,530
I got one of my beefs,
not with Tesla's per se in any way,

607
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:44,910
but I would say talking about cars
as some gunny, uh, out and about,

608
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:48,860
and they'll, we'll have
some conversation and, uh,

609
00:36:48,861 --> 00:36:52,920
I'll bring up some car or talking
about something like the dodge, uh,

610
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:56,130
and I wasn't the demon when the hell cat
came out. And so like, Oh yeah, those,

611
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,710
those hell,
I've heard amazing things about how,

612
00:36:58,711 --> 00:37:02,470
not only is it obviously incredibly
powerful and fast, but that they're,

613
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:05,100
they're massively comfortable.
You could, it's a gt car.

614
00:37:05,101 --> 00:37:09,120
You could grant her at all over the U S
and B comfy the whole time. And it was,

615
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:13,940
yeah. And they're like, oh, but
what about the Tesla? I'm like, um,

616
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,430
that's another 40 to $50,000
more. Oh, it's almost,

617
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:20,520
I heard it's as fast if not faster.
I go,

618
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:23,970
if I'm paying over a hundred fucking
thousand dollars for a car, get better.

619
00:37:23,971 --> 00:37:28,730
Be Fast. It better have all this shit
like, and I would talk about, you know,

620
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:32,850
certain other and a lot of times it's
like my Firebird doesn't cost that much.

621
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,370
Dude,
I don't care if that Tesla winds,

622
00:37:35,371 --> 00:37:39,630
you just spent $150,000 on a car.
What if cost wasn't an option?

623
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:44,010
What if you were Elon Musk? If
I'm Elan Musk, I'm, well God,

624
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:46,570
I don't think he can not drive
a Tesla if he's out there and,

625
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:49,820
and a goddamn three inch
exhaust for 70 you know,

626
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:53,550
big block I Pontiac people
are like, what the fuck? Yeah.

627
00:37:53,551 --> 00:37:58,190
He probably can't drive anything but
tussles and Oh, what a trap. Yeah. Yeah.

628
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:03,210
No, I wish I would rather,
I would rather drive a car.

629
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:06,930
I don't feel like electric cars have soul.
They don't have any,

630
00:38:06,931 --> 00:38:09,670
there's nothing that doesn't.
Thank you.

631
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,210
And then a little printer comes out
and I just doesn't do it for me. Well,

632
00:38:15,211 --> 00:38:19,260
they're really cool, but at the
end of the day, there's a problem.

633
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:23,060
The problem is it feels good to
hear the rumble of it. Engine.

634
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:28,050
I mean the fucking put that
clutch in and pop that gear.

635
00:38:28,051 --> 00:38:31,440
What does that Elan's to gas cars.

636
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:36,010
He owns a Jag.
That's an old school jag.

637
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:41,080
That's a hard, hard top.
It's probably a V12 actually.

638
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:46,180
Those are amazing. That's the first
love. Wow. Oh, it's a roadster. Okay,

639
00:38:46,181 --> 00:38:49,640
so that top pops off. Wow. That's, that's

640
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,820
shaped man. Look at that. The
edible. What year was that?

641
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:55,520
Oh yeah,
that's

642
00:38:56,330 --> 00:39:01,330
[inaudible] 60 [inaudible] 60
70 67 and it's a gorgeous car.

643
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:06,530
Ah, so pretty. Let me see that
picture again. Scroll down. Oh,

644
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:09,110
look at that.
Yeah,

645
00:39:09,111 --> 00:39:13,130
but there's something about the
sound of combustion engines. Just,

646
00:39:13,131 --> 00:39:16,790
it's so magnetic. Tesla's are
cool. They're silent. They're,

647
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:20,780
I'm sure they're incredibly comfortable.
Oh yeah. And that pad that they,

648
00:39:20,781 --> 00:39:24,010
big ass iPad that you have where
your navigation screen is. I mean,

649
00:39:24,011 --> 00:39:26,750
it is the shit while you're
driving and that thing.

650
00:39:26,751 --> 00:39:30,830
And you just ask it to play songs
and it pulls them up on Spotify.

651
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:31,933
I'm also a little bit

652
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:36,880
weirded out by the over elect
tronic element of modern life.

653
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:40,680
I realized the usefulness of it,
but I always think about,

654
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,260
you know when some shit goes south,

655
00:39:43,261 --> 00:39:48,261
like I can't just fix it and we keep
going or if something goes bad it could go

656
00:39:49,141 --> 00:39:52,830
bad and a lot of different
ways and there's a chain
of command of bad that that

657
00:39:52,831 --> 00:39:55,800
it's all linked to that it could go
to as well. And so I'm just like, Eh,

658
00:39:55,801 --> 00:39:59,360
it just doesn't it. Plus when you
talk about engines, all right, you,

659
00:39:59,361 --> 00:40:02,970
you start up your Porsche,
right? You start up know Yvette,

660
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:06,990
you start up an ls motor and then you
started up next to a big block Pontiac.

661
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:10,560
You started up next to a big block forward
and everything has a different feel,

662
00:40:10,561 --> 00:40:13,500
a different, the different cam that's
in it makes it sound different,

663
00:40:13,501 --> 00:40:15,750
makes it operate different.
The exhaust,

664
00:40:15,751 --> 00:40:20,250
it's on everything changes based on all
kinds of different elements. And so the,

665
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:22,140
the car even of itself,

666
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:25,680
not just the exterior of it but the
internal is make it seem like a different

667
00:40:25,681 --> 00:40:30,380
vehicle. Yeah, for sure. Like have
you ever been around Ferrari? Uh,

668
00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:33,030
not a ton, no. But I know they have,

669
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:37,210
they got this sound like
they had their own.

670
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:42,910
Aston Martin is famous for having,
it's a very specific exhaust note.

671
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:46,330
There's sounds that they have,
it's like a celebration.

672
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:51,310
It's like better not drive it too far
cause it's probably going to break before,

673
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:55,960
before the next 12 minutes. This
is fantastic. Nothing like it.

674
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:59,890
The way they sound like I used to
love top gear with Jeremy Clarkson.

675
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:04,300
Jeremy crusher. Yeah. He's the best.
Whoever he punched he said. Sorry.

676
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:06,160
Yeah.
Do the show Brad,

677
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:10,540
get over it right along BBC conscious lap.

678
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:14,020
It's what you were talking about earlier.
People are pussified there.

679
00:41:14,021 --> 00:41:15,790
Pussified there.
They're playing tough.

680
00:41:15,791 --> 00:41:18,940
They're doing a Goddamn car show
with a bunch of men drinking booze.

681
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:22,690
You guys got in a fight and
you got hit. Well, okay,

682
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:27,010
take a little settlement and move on. Give
them, take an apology or even just say,

683
00:41:27,011 --> 00:41:30,670
Hey, let me hit you one back. Fine, I
wish I was there. Jeremy, how much money?

684
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:34,040
What do you got in the bank?
Six to $70 million.

685
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:39,980
Give the man a million people wanting to
sort of live at parents' house for the

686
00:41:39,981 --> 00:41:40,641
rest of their life.

687
00:41:40,641 --> 00:41:44,350
Except then it goes from being mom and
dad to them being a state of some sort

688
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,560
that does all your work for you.

689
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:48,320
Cause you don't want to have to take
the responsibility of either winning or

690
00:41:48,321 --> 00:41:51,860
losing that confrontation. Maybe.
Well I think he just got punched.

691
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:57,300
Was a drunk asshole. Maybe
so, but if it's on Jeremy,

692
00:41:57,301 --> 00:41:59,990
you can just go in and be like, all right
dude, I'm going to, I get one on you.

693
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:03,080
Yeah, it's, and it's even, we're
done. I'll move on with my life.

694
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,360
But what if the guy can fucking crack?

695
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:08,810
Maybe she called Dale shouldn't have
fucking hit him that he shouldn't have

696
00:42:08,811 --> 00:42:11,650
fucking hit him at all.

697
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:15,950
Well that's the realm of people that
don't practice martial arts. Like,

698
00:42:15,951 --> 00:42:20,090
how many people get drunk
and get in fistfights that
actually know how to fight.

699
00:42:20,091 --> 00:42:22,460
It's pretty small.
It's according to the Internet.

700
00:42:22,461 --> 00:42:25,940
It's real small and he wants his father,
right?

701
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:30,620
It's always what they're doing.
You know, they think it's,

702
00:42:30,621 --> 00:42:33,360
I'm always amazed at people's,
uh,

703
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:35,750
overestimation of what they
can do with their body,

704
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:38,150
especially in it went
to pertains to animals.

705
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:41,240
Like what you would do if an
animal is coming at you. Like,

706
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:42,950
you know what my favorite
thing to watch is?

707
00:42:42,951 --> 00:42:45,890
One of my favorite things are the
last couple of weeks I got to stop.

708
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:50,150
I watched fucking running with the
bowls. Oh Man. When is that zen?

709
00:42:50,151 --> 00:42:53,270
This brands actually this week I think
I have a bunch of friends over there.

710
00:42:53,271 --> 00:42:56,810
They're going to do that. Call them. Call
them. Tell them you love them. Tell them,

711
00:42:57,310 --> 00:43:02,120
get the fuck out of there.
Hey, let's, let's uh,

712
00:43:02,350 --> 00:43:04,540
hey,
let's get this two ton animal fucking,

713
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:09,380
I don't think people understand a,
how strong those things are and B,

714
00:43:09,381 --> 00:43:12,830
how shitty their body works. People
have this idea. The, come at me, bro.

715
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:16,430
I'm going to fucking just get out of the
way. I'll just sidestep it. Meanwhile,

716
00:43:16,431 --> 00:43:20,600
you're on these slick beer
soaked. What is this, Jamie? Oh,

717
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:22,100
this is the end of it right now.

718
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:26,210
It's the sixth of the 14 it's happening
right now. I can't believe it.

719
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:29,360
I've been watching videos.
I didn't know it was actually live.

720
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:33,410
This is on Instagram.
So fucking insane.

721
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:37,730
This is so insane. People are so
insane. What if it gets a beat on you?

722
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:38,930
And then all of a sudden,
like a note,

723
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:42,920
you're the only one out of this entire
crowd of 500 people right now that it

724
00:43:42,921 --> 00:43:46,460
wants to Gore. Oh yeah. Well, I mean,
if it finds one that sits still,

725
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:49,850
it's going to tickets, frustrations
out. And the crazy thing is,

726
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:53,870
look how many people were there watching
this and watching these fools running

727
00:43:53,871 --> 00:43:55,760
around in the middle of this bull fight.

728
00:43:55,761 --> 00:43:57,980
I want to see someone
get fucked up by a bull.

729
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:02,900
Have you ever watched a bull fight? Uh,
I have not. I have seen plenty of clips,

730
00:44:02,901 --> 00:44:05,300
footage of it, what have you, but
I've never watched a bullfight. Yeah,

731
00:44:05,301 --> 00:44:07,850
I'm not interested. It doesn't
really do anything for me. No.

732
00:44:07,851 --> 00:44:12,290
I mean I can up until the
point of, of, of killing it.

733
00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:17,090
I, okay. You want to go out there and
dodge a bull? Uh, seems like a bad idea,

734
00:44:17,091 --> 00:44:20,330
but all right. But then you, all right,

735
00:44:20,331 --> 00:44:22,880
you've already proven that you can
maneuver yourself out of the way.

736
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:24,610
No need to spirit and kill it.
Yeah.

737
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:27,620
It also seems to me that
I know it's tradition.

738
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:30,410
I know it comes from a different
era. I know. I understand that.

739
00:44:30,411 --> 00:44:32,090
And so I'm not gonna sit
here and then just like

740
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:36,150
go railroading bullfighting this is,
their acquisition is tradition too.

741
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:38,790
There's a lot of things that
are very successful. Yeah.

742
00:44:39,170 --> 00:44:43,850
There's a lot of horrific traditions.
It just seems to me to be a, uh,

743
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:49,020
a bastardization of our relationship
with animals. Like even,

744
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:51,960
I don't think there's anything
wrong with domesticated animals,

745
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:57,110
but obviously factory farming is this
disgusting. It's nasty. Why, why do it?

746
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:59,160
And there is no,
I,

747
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:03,960
it's possible to have animals that are
able to live a more natural way of life

748
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:07,900
then it is to jam them into a
cage and force feed them until,

749
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:10,630
I don't know if it's possible to do
it the way we've been doing it though.

750
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:14,820
The real problem is the way we expect
to be able to just go to Jack in the box

751
00:45:14,821 --> 00:45:18,810
and get a burger. Well, we eat
too much meat. Yeah. I in general,

752
00:45:18,811 --> 00:45:23,460
I think that your average person doesn't
need to eat nearly as much fucking

753
00:45:23,461 --> 00:45:26,730
varieties of meat as they do. They need,
they definitely need meat in their diet,

754
00:45:26,731 --> 00:45:31,650
I believe. Uh, on average.
Do you know, you know about
the carnivore diet? Now, see,

755
00:45:31,651 --> 00:45:36,440
here's the thing. I've been, uh,
uh, I heard you talking to you,

756
00:45:36,441 --> 00:45:39,390
you've talked a lot about, and then
Jordan Peterson and his, his daughter,

757
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:43,500
I talked about it with Chris Bell First,
who's been on it for,

758
00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:49,140
I think he's been on it for
at least six months or so.

759
00:45:49,141 --> 00:45:53,430
And he's having radical improvements
and one of the reasons that he's having

760
00:45:53,431 --> 00:45:57,490
improvements and then Jordan's
having tremendous results and uh,

761
00:45:57,510 --> 00:46:01,070
Jordan's daughter as well is arthritis.
They all have arthritis.

762
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:05,670
Like Chris Bell has two artificial hips.
I don't doubt it.

763
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:10,380
Tried to be that Marcus Smelly,
smelly Chris, Chris, Chris's boar,

764
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:15,240
Chris Board Bell. And Chris is the
one who, uh, produce bigger, stronger,

765
00:46:15,241 --> 00:46:19,240
faster. I met Chris, I've met, I've
actually never met mark. They're great.

766
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:22,880
Chris is a fantastic, always got
us backward baseball cap on. Yeah,

767
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:26,550
they're both fantastic guys and really,
really smart and just,

768
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:29,820
Chris has suffered from serious,

769
00:46:29,821 --> 00:46:32,580
debilitating arthritis and pain
in his joints his whole life.

770
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:37,570
Having a carnivore diet knocked it out
for him. And, and that's thing. Uh,

771
00:46:37,650 --> 00:46:41,790
I was familiar with the ketogenic diet
and all that kind of stuff and having a

772
00:46:41,791 --> 00:46:46,020
higher, it works for me as well
to be honest, to eat that way. My,

773
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:50,450
my problem is my love affair with
fucking breads. Their problem,

774
00:46:50,490 --> 00:46:52,820
you're out there getting a coffee
maybe in the morning, like, damn,

775
00:46:52,830 --> 00:46:54,420
that looks like an amazing
croissant right now.

776
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:57,840
You know how it looks even better in
my face. He like a chocolate croissant.

777
00:46:57,870 --> 00:47:00,690
I do like chocolate croissants. You
know, you always get the best ones.

778
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:04,350
Coffee Bean, those Starbucks ones
can suck my dick. You know what?

779
00:47:04,351 --> 00:47:07,020
I don't eat croissants. I
don't eat. I'm a Seattle Guy,

780
00:47:07,021 --> 00:47:09,930
but I don't need Starbucks for science.
You don't know. They're terrible.

781
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:11,790
They used to be okay.
They used to be pretty good.

782
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:14,370
You know when they went south and they
started putting them in plastic bags,

783
00:47:14,550 --> 00:47:18,150
they give them to you again. They're
already sealed up in a plastic bag back.

784
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:22,680
No one's at coffee bean have way more
chocolate in them. They're thick.

785
00:47:22,681 --> 00:47:26,720
If you're going to go deep, go deep.
That's what I say. I go to the, the off,

786
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:30,940
you know the non chain coffee
shops that will like a coffee,

787
00:47:30,941 --> 00:47:32,980
coffee and food and coffee commissary.

788
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:35,320
He's down the street
here or Russian bakery.

789
00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:39,610
These chocolate croissants knock
dick right into the dirt. Can Bet.

790
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:43,690
Ooh Rich and delicious.
Yeah.

791
00:47:43,691 --> 00:47:47,770
I'll just want to get driver for
them. I got good coffee tonight. If I,

792
00:47:47,771 --> 00:47:51,850
if I stick to eating and then
any more ketogenic way it's,

793
00:47:52,090 --> 00:47:55,330
I feel better. My joints hurt less. Uh,

794
00:47:55,510 --> 00:48:00,330
I lose fat easier, but I still
can, can put on muscle mass. It's,

795
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:01,900
it is a better way for me to eat.

796
00:48:01,901 --> 00:48:06,310
And I don't know if there is something
about our genetic makeups say meet you

797
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:10,000
JP. We probably have some
crossover similarity there. Yeah.

798
00:48:10,030 --> 00:48:11,740
I don't know if there's
anything to do with that.

799
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:16,660
I just know that it's been
useful to me and I've seen it be,

800
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:18,700
you know, that's the way
you eat. And I've seen,

801
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:22,480
I've heard Jordan talk about his daughter
and how useful it's been for her and

802
00:48:22,810 --> 00:48:23,643
as you,

803
00:48:24,030 --> 00:48:28,450
I mean she's had her ankle replaced or
hip replaced like an auto immune thing as

804
00:48:28,451 --> 00:48:28,810
does he,

805
00:48:28,810 --> 00:48:29,280
it's the same.

806
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:34,280
It's same exact issue and an autoimmune
issue is also what this radical

807
00:48:34,491 --> 00:48:35,324
arthritises.

808
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:39,190
I mean there's so many people have
these issues and these are isolated

809
00:48:39,191 --> 00:48:43,170
incidences, you know, isolated issues
that people have. But you know,

810
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:46,630
I know people that thrive on vegetarian
diets. I have no problem with it. Yeah,

811
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,550
a vegetarian is the way to go.

812
00:48:48,551 --> 00:48:52,330
For a lot of people that are
thinking about being Vegan,
don't be scared of eggs,

813
00:48:52,331 --> 00:48:55,090
folks, just get eggs are good
for you. Eggs are great for you.

814
00:48:55,091 --> 00:48:59,650
Just all this fucking Peta propaganda when
they called him chicken periods. Look,

815
00:48:59,651 --> 00:49:02,980
if you don't want to kill animals, I get
it. I get it. I told him, I love animals.

816
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:05,380
Get free range eggs.

817
00:49:05,381 --> 00:49:09,820
You can get them at the fucking farmer's
market and they have a dark orange yolk

818
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:11,360
and they're fucking great for you.

819
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:14,500
And the chickens don't even notice
they're gone. They don't give a fuck.

820
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:16,250
No chickens going to
have eggs no matter what.

821
00:49:16,350 --> 00:49:20,870
They just lay them and less there's
a rooster to exactly to fertilize it.

822
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:23,480
They just kind of fucking lay.
Hey. Yeah, it's just free food.

823
00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:27,930
It's like a gift that they give
you a free tans. Keystone chickens.

824
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:33,080
I had six eggs this morning for breakfast
and credible, thicker and heavier,

825
00:49:33,081 --> 00:49:37,610
and it's actually good for you and
a of all things. One of chickens,

826
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:39,410
one of their favorite little snacks.

827
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:42,000
That's something that they
just absolutely love. Eggs.

828
00:49:43,670 --> 00:49:46,400
Chickens love scrambled eggs. Yeah.
You know what they really love?

829
00:49:46,410 --> 00:49:50,780
They love shells. They love the
fuck shit. Shells. Shells. Yeah. No,

830
00:49:50,781 --> 00:49:55,570
they love more than that. Mice,
mice, lizard sale. Fuck. Oh fuck.

831
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:59,150
Yeah. But you know what? They
don't fuck with squirrels.
Well, they're a little big.

832
00:49:59,420 --> 00:50:04,010
Yeah, but they just don't even try
like squirrels, like a rat, you know?

833
00:50:04,011 --> 00:50:08,240
It's basically a rat. Everybody loves
squirrels. Even chickens step bushy tail.

834
00:50:08,241 --> 00:50:10,250
It's crazy. That bushy
tails. All you needed,

835
00:50:10,251 --> 00:50:15,080
that cute haircut is like this little
snap and a wink and ah, yeah. Yeah.

836
00:50:15,530 --> 00:50:18,150
Well, I had a, I had four
chickens and one time, uh,

837
00:50:18,590 --> 00:50:20,850
there was a little miniature Chihuahua,

838
00:50:20,870 --> 00:50:24,410
a little chihuahua or a little
mini docksin maybe or mini mint.

839
00:50:24,411 --> 00:50:27,110
It was a min pin and it got into the yard

840
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:32,980
and ended up in the backyard and the four
chickens cornered it and wouldn't let

841
00:50:33,801 --> 00:50:38,390
it leave. And so it's back there.
Wine and, and Yelp in. And eventually,

842
00:50:38,570 --> 00:50:42,730
uh, my ex at the time went and caught
the dog and then tried to figure out how,

843
00:50:42,731 --> 00:50:46,160
whose it was and what have you.
And it turned out it was chipped.

844
00:50:46,161 --> 00:50:50,000
I think [inaudible] got given somewhere
where someone can then track them down.

845
00:50:50,001 --> 00:50:52,640
But it was just hilarious that these
chickens were like, fuck you motherfucker.

846
00:50:52,641 --> 00:50:56,720
You're in the wrong place. You
know else loves squirrels. My dog.

847
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:01,850
That's a different animal
all together. Yeah. Marshall,

848
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:04,370
they hardly ever catch him though.
He got that one.

849
00:51:05,570 --> 00:51:10,530
It was like this sweet golden retriever,
this kind dog who loves everybody.

850
00:51:10,531 --> 00:51:13,040
Yeah. He likes fucking
up squirrels too. Well,

851
00:51:13,041 --> 00:51:14,930
the problem is the squirrels
go into the chicken coop.

852
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:17,510
They'll find a way in the chicken coop
and they steal all the chickens for food

853
00:51:17,870 --> 00:51:21,410
and Marshall just decided to wait outside
the chicken coop because he knew where

854
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:22,244
the hole was.

855
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:26,450
I just sit in there and snatch that
mother fucker home and then he's just with

856
00:51:26,451 --> 00:51:30,470
the biggest shading ground space. Yeah,
Mrs Rogue and does not like the squirrels.

857
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:33,110
She doesn't like the squirrels
getting into the chicken food. To me,

858
00:51:33,111 --> 00:51:36,590
I feel like we just buy more chicken food.
Poor little squirrels hustling.

859
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:40,010
It's hard life being a squirrel.
It is just trying to get an melodies.

860
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:44,180
You know church is trying to get by
trying to live your life are out there.

861
00:51:44,181 --> 00:51:47,660
They're all this peer pressure from all
these other squirrels smoking young.

862
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:47,931
Yeah.

863
00:51:47,931 --> 00:51:52,550
They find this sweet spot where all
these fucking nuts and all this grain is

864
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:55,410
like, this is amazing. Yeah.
It was issued scroll gang.

865
00:51:55,470 --> 00:51:57,860
You know when they fucked up though,
they started stealing eggs.

866
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:00,080
They stay stealing eggs.
These cons,

867
00:52:00,081 --> 00:52:03,800
we're trying to roll eggs out of the
chicken coop. That's when she got mad.

868
00:52:04,430 --> 00:52:08,870
I had no idea that squirrels ate eggs.
And then we started finding videos online.

869
00:52:08,871 --> 00:52:10,520
Jamie pulled up a bunch
of videos of squirrels,

870
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:13,700
Rolan chicken eggs out of a
chain of murder that either

871
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:18,770
the motherfuckers we, they have, we have
egg boxes, they're elevated egg boxes.

872
00:52:18,771 --> 00:52:21,110
Okay. The egg boxes like two and
a half, three feet off the ground.

873
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:26,090
Squirrels got up into the egg box, got
the egg, chucked it out of the egg box,

874
00:52:26,130 --> 00:52:28,970
lands on the ground. The getting it
in their role in the egg. Look clever.

875
00:52:28,971 --> 00:52:32,480
Little fucker's sneaky and they're cute.
So they're like,

876
00:52:32,481 --> 00:52:36,440
I can get away with anything. They do get
away with more. Like rats must be like,

877
00:52:36,441 --> 00:52:39,080
what in the fuck man?
Where's the smart as shit?

878
00:52:39,090 --> 00:52:43,270
We were way smarter and yet
people can fuck him on us.

879
00:52:43,350 --> 00:52:47,420
Just stab us left and right. Yeah. There's
no industry for Squirrel killing. Like,

880
00:52:47,421 --> 00:52:48,260
no,
not really.

881
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:52,610
Maybe in the deep south and that's not
an industry get their mortgage is paid by

882
00:52:52,611 --> 00:52:56,270
killing rats. Like they're driving
around in a nice car from killing rats.

883
00:52:58,660 --> 00:53:02,390
This Nolan and nobody cared. Nobody
feels bad. Like, Oh, I'm an exterminator.

884
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:05,400
We're all racist when it comes to
certain animals and bugs, right?

885
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:09,560
People collect butterflies, nobody
stomp, roaches, everybody stomps,

886
00:53:09,561 --> 00:53:13,760
roaches and swats mosquitoes. Well
fuck mosquitoes. Those things,

887
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:17,090
they will give you everything, you
know, all kinds of diseases and shame,

888
00:53:17,091 --> 00:53:18,800
gay fever.
Larry,

889
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:22,760
the only part of the mosquitoes life I
enjoy or think is interesting is when

890
00:53:22,761 --> 00:53:26,730
their larva and they're these fucking
vicious little with these giant hook teeth

891
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:31,380
that will can't even eat little fish and
all that kind of stuff in the ponds too.

892
00:53:31,381 --> 00:53:32,700
When I first moved to California,

893
00:53:32,701 --> 00:53:37,410
I rented this house in Encino and nobody
lived in it for like a year and a half,

894
00:53:37,411 --> 00:53:39,810
two years, something like that. And uh,

895
00:53:39,811 --> 00:53:43,800
they had a pool in the backyard that was
just sitting there with Terrell gamma

896
00:53:43,801 --> 00:53:46,190
green.
He wasn't just,

897
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:50,700
there was schools of mosquito
larva swimming around like fish.

898
00:53:50,970 --> 00:53:53,940
I went out into the yard. I was like, what
the fuck is that? And the guy was like,

899
00:53:53,970 --> 00:53:57,860
oh, we'll take care of that. I go,
what is that? You have that? Yes.

900
00:53:57,990 --> 00:54:01,140
You poison the, she just pour
bleach into it. Yeah. Well,

901
00:54:01,141 --> 00:54:04,330
the first thing you do is you bleach it,
then you've got to drain it. You gotta,

902
00:54:04,350 --> 00:54:06,710
you gotta take all this Goop,
all that shit out. Yeah.

903
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,640
You got to drain all that water out.

904
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:13,050
They had to bring like a machine and
then they had a clean, all the fucking,

905
00:54:13,051 --> 00:54:15,540
the bottom of the pool.
It was all green and funky.

906
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:19,950
But the crazy thing is they were moving
through the water. Like, you know,

907
00:54:19,951 --> 00:54:23,520
I see those, those big flocks of birds.
Yes. And they all moved together.

908
00:54:23,730 --> 00:54:27,150
They were doing that in the water.
There was fucking thousands of them.

909
00:54:27,151 --> 00:54:30,690
It was crazy. But then they didn't grow
legs. Oh, it would've been a real problem.

910
00:54:31,110 --> 00:54:33,300
It would have been a real problem if
that got out and started flying around,

911
00:54:33,301 --> 00:54:33,980
I would've got fucked.

912
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:38,060
Doug. There's a meme out there,
uh, and it's, I think it's a, um,

913
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:41,490
it's a picture, um, and it's repeated in,

914
00:54:41,491 --> 00:54:46,490
in on the bottom as well of a
peta billboard and it's got,

915
00:54:46,491 --> 00:54:50,270
uh, you know, uh, these animals, all
Sydney at standing in a line and it says,

916
00:54:50,271 --> 00:54:53,420
where do you draw the line between
food and friends or whatever?

917
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:54,980
And then someone else has,

918
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:58,760
then they've got the same thing down
there and it's like, uh, you know,

919
00:54:58,790 --> 00:55:03,200
this is normal food is a catastrophic,
that apocalypse.

920
00:55:04,610 --> 00:55:08,220
I've seen that, I've seen
that. Yeah. Well, you know,

921
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:12,030
being a vegetarian or Vegan is a very,
it's a very first world option.

922
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:16,860
The reason why people got to this point
is because we figured out a way to

923
00:55:16,861 --> 00:55:18,960
survive eating all the animals around us,

924
00:55:18,961 --> 00:55:22,260
just like they figured out
a way to survive eating the
animals around them. Well,

925
00:55:22,261 --> 00:55:23,650
I need the argument that,
oh,

926
00:55:23,670 --> 00:55:27,000
this culture is mostly vegetarian or
veer this or that. And it's like, okay,

927
00:55:27,001 --> 00:55:31,780
well it's also highly developed
based on what was available. Yeah.

928
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:34,770
Like they didn't just say, I don't
want to hurt the animals. Well,

929
00:55:34,771 --> 00:55:38,400
the only people that did is the Hindu
hidden. Those are fascinating, you know,

930
00:55:38,401 --> 00:55:41,010
and there's a lot of speculation
as to wash starkly clipboard.

931
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:45,330
He developed civilization
at certain points in time
in comparison to the rest of

932
00:55:45,331 --> 00:55:48,480
the world. Oh yeah. I mean you go
back and read the Bhagavad Gita.

933
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:53,480
I mean they had some really complex
philosophy and really interesting thoughts

934
00:55:53,941 --> 00:55:54,840
about the universe.

935
00:55:54,841 --> 00:55:58,020
But a lot of people believe that
that was due to psychedelic drugs.

936
00:55:58,410 --> 00:55:59,500
And one of the,
yeah,

937
00:55:59,530 --> 00:56:03,090
well one of the reasons why they believe
they had this interesting relationship

938
00:56:03,091 --> 00:56:08,091
with cattle but not with lamb was because
cattle shit would grow magic mushrooms

939
00:56:08,551 --> 00:56:08,910
on it.

940
00:56:08,910 --> 00:56:13,910
This is because so much is a big part
of the ancient Hindu folklore and their

941
00:56:16,351 --> 00:56:17,940
religion and their ancient texts,

942
00:56:17,941 --> 00:56:22,941
they talk about Soma and so much was some
sort of a psychedelic mixture and they

943
00:56:24,251 --> 00:56:28,720
don't know exactly what it was, but
they know that Hindus, um, the, um,

944
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:31,540
like a lot of the ancient Hindu text,

945
00:56:31,690 --> 00:56:36,690
they deal with some sacraments and
they know that they were in to hash.

946
00:56:37,090 --> 00:56:40,300
And like a lot of the Yogis,
Assad dues, they're into chillums,

947
00:56:40,301 --> 00:56:44,140
they smoke chillums of Hash.
So they knew they were into hash,

948
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:49,560
but they think that their aversion to
eating cows may have had something to do

949
00:56:50,141 --> 00:56:53,170
with the fact that these cows would shit.

950
00:56:53,171 --> 00:56:54,930
And then the mushrooms
that grow up in house shit.

951
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:57,370
And then they would eat these mushrooms
and have these profound experiences.

952
00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:01,350
And so that these, the thought of
these cows as conduits to God, right.

953
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:05,860
But then there's, you know, also the
probably drank the mill, you know,

954
00:57:05,861 --> 00:57:10,700
they probably use them to plow the
fields to grow their food. So it's,

955
00:57:10,701 --> 00:57:12,280
it's real.
It's interesting because when a,

956
00:57:12,281 --> 00:57:16,060
when a culture has an aversion to
eating as a very specific animal,

957
00:57:16,061 --> 00:57:20,620
and that specific animal also is the
main source of psychedelic mushrooms,

958
00:57:21,230 --> 00:57:23,820
to ignore that connection
seems a little bit weird. No,

959
00:57:23,830 --> 00:57:25,000
I don't think it's arbitrary.

960
00:57:25,030 --> 00:57:29,230
I think it's something that would be
worth investigating, right? I mean,

961
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:32,440
why not?
And it worst case scenario come down to,

962
00:57:32,470 --> 00:57:36,240
you have to figure out something else,
but we'll just look at Shiva like, right.

963
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:39,460
You see that picture of Shiva?
Shiva has arms,

964
00:57:39,461 --> 00:57:42,130
six arms and Shiva
standing on like a little,

965
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:44,670
it looks like a baby and I always am like,

966
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:49,480
I have a giant bronze Shiva in my house.
And when I bought it, the lady said,

967
00:57:49,510 --> 00:57:54,430
uh, this a shiva is standing on ignorance.
This is what it's supposed to be.

968
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:56,710
I go, I thought ignorance
would be way bigger than that.

969
00:57:58,630 --> 00:58:02,470
I felt like that ignorance would be like
a dragon. That Shiva was like fighting.

970
00:58:02,471 --> 00:58:07,420
It was much larger than him. But when
you, that, that thing that she was doing,

971
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:10,450
that's what happens when you
trip your balls off. Okay.

972
00:58:10,451 --> 00:58:13,390
If you trip balls and you were
started moving your arms around,

973
00:58:13,391 --> 00:58:17,500
I would think Josh Barnett,
it's got six on that. I mean,

974
00:58:17,530 --> 00:58:21,880
there's so much of ancient
Hindu artwork that is, uh,

975
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:25,960
I thought they were just fan and a bad
fart could be, that could be that Jesus,

976
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:28,510
that's what we'll all get to fire
around it. Maybe that's what it is.

977
00:58:28,511 --> 00:58:32,740
They're lighting matches, but the
like ancient Hindu art, there's,

978
00:58:32,741 --> 00:58:37,210
there's this a iconography,
there's like these iconic imagery,

979
00:58:37,690 --> 00:58:40,870
this iconic imagery that you
see when you do psychedelics.

980
00:58:40,871 --> 00:58:42,280
You see a lot of this stuff,

981
00:58:42,490 --> 00:58:46,970
particularly on mushrooms for some
reason you'll see like ancient Hindu and

982
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:51,610
sometimes ancient Egyptian shit too.
Well, I know, you know, you can see,

983
00:58:51,970 --> 00:58:56,770
you'll see a geometric shapes appear out
of and you know, to me I'm just like,

984
00:58:56,771 --> 00:58:59,830
well that's just what you see when
you're poisoned. But it's a great,

985
00:58:59,831 --> 00:59:02,430
it's an interesting way of looking at it,
but it's not poison.

986
00:59:02,450 --> 00:59:03,960
That's the thing about it. It's, it's a,

987
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:08,500
the way it's affecting the way your
visual processing it perturbance of your

988
00:59:08,501 --> 00:59:12,010
visual cortex. Yeah. But it's not
poison. That's the crazy thing.

989
00:59:12,011 --> 00:59:14,050
It's like the LD 50 of mushrooms.

990
00:59:14,051 --> 00:59:15,970
It's almost impossible
to eat yourself to death.

991
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:18,460
Like you'd have to eat your
own body weight. Like you,

992
00:59:18,461 --> 00:59:22,400
you would get way too stuff.
Put them inside those fucking croissants.

993
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:27,320
Chocolate croissants.
Now you talking and might be the move.

994
00:59:27,321 --> 00:59:31,790
So that's a term that has
continued to go throughout.

995
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:34,240
Uh,
it's like a sleeping pill now that,

996
00:59:34,250 --> 00:59:38,060
and then it was also a major element
within all this Huxley's brave new world,

997
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:41,750
which, uh, I am that was
based on that probably.

998
00:59:41,751 --> 00:59:46,700
So I'm firmly of the belief that what
we're living in is not a Orwellian,

999
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:50,270
uh, potential, just stop, just
opek future. We're living in a,

1000
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:53,960
in a Huxley version because Huxley and
Orwell was sought from two different ways

1001
00:59:53,961 --> 00:59:55,700
and in Orwell was more of the,

1002
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:59,150
there would be force and violence and,

1003
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:04,240
and direct suppression of
individuals and groups and uh,

1004
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:09,260
retrain. Now there is thought
policing and, and you know,

1005
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:14,210
even though they call them equity,
diversity, whatever departments,

1006
01:00:14,211 --> 01:00:19,070
I mean, there are people that are there
to, you know, they have these cabals that,

1007
01:00:19,130 --> 01:00:22,010
that try to force everybody to
be in line, but it's, you know,

1008
01:00:22,011 --> 01:00:25,910
they're not necessarily gassing folks are
beating on him or what have your shock

1009
01:00:25,911 --> 01:00:26,744
therapy.

1010
01:00:27,410 --> 01:00:32,410
However Huxley's version of how this would
all go badly was that everybody would

1011
01:00:34,251 --> 01:00:39,251
be so comfortable that there would be
so much luxury and pleasure and that you

1012
01:00:40,311 --> 01:00:42,720
would just not fight back.
Yeah.

1013
01:00:42,730 --> 01:00:46,490
Anything that they would try
to impart upon you though,

1014
01:00:46,491 --> 01:00:49,600
the way they would get you to do it is
just make your life even softer and even

1015
01:00:49,601 --> 01:00:50,000
easier.

1016
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,500
Yeah.
Huxley was right in that regard.

1017
01:00:51,501 --> 01:00:56,501
And also all there's so little danger in
the world and so little real drama that

1018
01:00:58,551 --> 01:01:01,100
we look for drama. Of course, we
look for it all over the place.

1019
01:01:01,430 --> 01:01:06,380
We've made the world's going
on most of the world. Very,
very safe, especially for,

1020
01:01:06,381 --> 01:01:08,960
at least for us in west,
in the first world nations.

1021
01:01:08,990 --> 01:01:12,680
There's a something that
Dave Rubin tweeted today, see
if you could find this. Um,

1022
01:01:12,770 --> 01:01:16,370
it's real reason that the nearby stars,
I don't think so.

1023
01:01:16,371 --> 01:01:20,330
Now the mayor of Durham,
uh, apparently, uh,

1024
01:01:20,331 --> 01:01:25,160
said something about Jordan Peterson
that Jordan Peterson is not welcome in

1025
01:01:25,161 --> 01:01:25,760
Durham,

1026
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:30,760
North Carolina because of his
transphobic and racist views.

1027
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:33,260
What, yeah, what is it?
Let's see. I can't read.

1028
01:01:33,261 --> 01:01:37,730
That man can make that a little larger.
What a fucking misrepresented person,

1029
01:01:37,731 --> 01:01:42,230
Jordan Peterson has become just, well,
it's gotta be late. Very strange.

1030
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:47,120
We believe that Durham is a place for all
of us. Black, white, Asian, Latin ex. Oh,

1031
01:01:47,121 --> 01:01:51,560
I like how you went Latin x instead
of Latino because if he say to next,

1032
01:01:51,561 --> 01:01:56,330
it's like Latina, Latino, you get all
the Latinos. I'm not taking any chances.

1033
01:01:56,570 --> 01:02:00,470
Indigenous and mixed race, Trans
and CIS. This is in the real word.

1034
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:05,030
You're getting crazy. Mayor, gay and
lesbian. Queer and straight scissor thing.

1035
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:08,280
Queered Lens cover all of it anymore.
It's not here.

1036
01:02:08,540 --> 01:02:12,720
Uh, I'm always confused by
that. It got down very open.

1037
01:02:12,721 --> 01:02:15,850
Vague term.
I mean it may be there is a an there.

1038
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:20,030
Maybe there's some sort of
accepted standard for what?
What defines queer versus

1039
01:02:20,030 --> 01:02:23,430
studying asexual.
Is that all right?

1040
01:02:23,910 --> 01:02:27,280
How come you didn't put that
in the asexual people? You
should march. Oh yeah, now,

1041
01:02:27,290 --> 01:02:29,810
now, now, now they're
fucked. A tap. Asexual,

1042
01:02:29,811 --> 01:02:34,230
a activist lobbies coming from those who
seek to exclude or deny the humanity of

1043
01:02:34,231 --> 01:02:36,080
others will find no confidence.
Interesting.

1044
01:02:36,150 --> 01:02:38,820
That's always an interesting
statement that people like to make.

1045
01:02:38,821 --> 01:02:40,080
Deny the humanity.

1046
01:02:40,081 --> 01:02:44,340
Like who said that you who's denying
your humanity even even assholes, right?

1047
01:02:44,341 --> 01:02:46,500
I mean even some of this is just a prick.
It's like they can't,

1048
01:02:47,110 --> 01:02:49,650
you just heard it and responded to it.

1049
01:02:49,890 --> 01:02:53,760
You're living the life that you want to
live. How can they deny your humanity?

1050
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:54,691
What?
Look at this,

1051
01:02:54,691 --> 01:02:58,380
we wish to emphasize that a person's
right to free speech does not include the

1052
01:02:58,381 --> 01:03:01,500
right to a platform or an audience.
Well here's the thing,

1053
01:03:01,530 --> 01:03:06,530
you can't deny that people are
listening to him and enjoy his work.

1054
01:03:06,870 --> 01:03:09,270
But if you're gonna make
these broad statements,

1055
01:03:09,271 --> 01:03:12,480
you have to have some sort of evidence
to back up what you're saying.

1056
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:16,320
I know Jordan Peterson and
he's definitely not a racist.

1057
01:03:16,590 --> 01:03:20,010
He's definitely not transphobic or
homophobic or any of those things.

1058
01:03:20,250 --> 01:03:24,240
He was against compelled
speech compelled speech,

1059
01:03:24,241 --> 01:03:25,680
state compelled speech,

1060
01:03:25,681 --> 01:03:29,670
meaning that there was a
bunch of different words
that they were forcing people

1061
01:03:29,671 --> 01:03:34,050
to use that were these new gender
pronouns and they were compelling.

1062
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:38,800
And they have human rights councils
in Canada and he is, and he's a,

1063
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:43,920
I mean he's a clinical psychologist and
he's very well read and he understands

1064
01:03:44,130 --> 01:03:48,700
like Marxism and all the pitfalls
modernism in neo Marxism and its,

1065
01:03:48,701 --> 01:03:52,140
its evolution from classical Marxism
and how it's been influenced,

1066
01:03:52,170 --> 01:03:56,520
the difference between emphasizing the
super structure over the base virtue

1067
01:03:56,521 --> 01:04:01,110
signaling in its worst form. I am a,
a very, very familiar with jps work.

1068
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:05,310
He actually sent me a copy of his book
through Twitter. Oh that's amazing.

1069
01:04:05,670 --> 01:04:06,630
Which was fantastic.

1070
01:04:06,631 --> 01:04:11,631
But the way I came across Jordan Peterson
was that as a big fan of nature and

1071
01:04:12,121 --> 01:04:13,350
his philosophical writings,

1072
01:04:13,530 --> 01:04:17,550
so I'd go on Youtube to see if I can
find lectures on Nicha and in his maps of

1073
01:04:17,551 --> 01:04:21,010
meaning lectures. And this is
before any of the like, uh,

1074
01:04:21,150 --> 01:04:24,480
the issues with able to see 16 really,
I didn't know about any of that.

1075
01:04:24,481 --> 01:04:28,380
I was just listening to Jordan Peterson
lectures because of him referencing and

1076
01:04:28,381 --> 01:04:32,670
talking about nature. So, and then from
Nietzsche Dostoyevsky and all this.

1077
01:04:32,671 --> 01:04:37,671
And he then start talking a lot about
Marxism and communism and postmodernism in

1078
01:04:38,791 --> 01:04:42,360
reference to each other in other ways.
And then then the [inaudible] stuff.

1079
01:04:42,361 --> 01:04:46,440
And then I was living with a Marxists
for awhile, so I started, we really, yes.

1080
01:04:46,770 --> 01:04:48,930
Oh Jesus. Yeah, it was not fun. So,

1081
01:04:48,931 --> 01:04:53,931
but at the same time I had to try to
understand what the arguments that were

1082
01:04:54,061 --> 01:04:58,680
being made and why. And so you got to
go research them. So if someone says,

1083
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:03,810
oh, the wage gap, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah. And I'm like, okay,

1084
01:05:03,811 --> 01:05:06,060
well I guess I need to look up
the research on what that is.

1085
01:05:06,061 --> 01:05:08,130
Then you come back and you go,
oh,

1086
01:05:08,131 --> 01:05:12,240
well that's actually not an apples for
apples comparison and it's not 70% on the

1087
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:12,640
dollar.

1088
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:16,620
And then you just go into it and then
they'd just look at you and they go, no,

1089
01:05:16,650 --> 01:05:21,490
it's like I read, what's your source?
Well, this thing, I read that source,

1090
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:26,480
it doesn't talk about education level
job for job hours work like it does.

1091
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:29,500
It doesn't. I mean, no one's saying
that, that things couldn't be better.

1092
01:05:29,580 --> 01:05:33,310
It's just different. Heard this argument
before. When you hear about the wage gap,

1093
01:05:33,311 --> 01:05:37,030
the gender wage gap, it's not this,
it's not people doing the same job.

1094
01:05:37,270 --> 01:05:39,450
That's what's this is this
is the best way to set up.

1095
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:42,310
It's not people doing the same job and
it's not people working the same hours.

1096
01:05:42,340 --> 01:05:45,010
The reason why men make more money
as they do different jobs now,

1097
01:05:45,011 --> 01:05:48,280
are those jobs more difficult for women
to get is a real question. Some of them,

1098
01:05:48,281 --> 01:05:50,980
I imagine they are perhaps.
I mean,

1099
01:05:50,981 --> 01:05:55,870
I never doubt that there is a potential
sexism or any sort of ism to some degree

1100
01:05:55,871 --> 01:05:58,750
in some or sexism coming from
both sides of the tracks. Sure.

1101
01:05:58,751 --> 01:05:59,380
The way they're sending.

1102
01:05:59,380 --> 01:06:03,520
How many women want to be working on a
fucking oil rig out in the middle of or

1103
01:06:03,521 --> 01:06:07,490
doing pipelines up in frozen South Dakota,
North Dakota or something.

1104
01:06:07,491 --> 01:06:08,324
I mean they not.

1105
01:06:08,490 --> 01:06:12,370
And how many of them are physically
capable of doing the work to which isn't a

1106
01:06:12,371 --> 01:06:15,840
woman's fault at all and you can't,
I wouldn't hold it against anybody or,

1107
01:06:15,850 --> 01:06:17,200
and if they didn't,
if they chose did,

1108
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:19,690
did not want to choose to
do that kind of employment.

1109
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:22,360
There's nothing wrong with
that either. No. You know,

1110
01:06:22,361 --> 01:06:25,900
if a woman wanted to go off
and make artisans soap, right?

1111
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:30,730
That mother fucker could make the best
soap with essential oils that are the

1112
01:06:30,731 --> 01:06:33,580
best for like, you know, like
how you use defense soap stuff.

1113
01:06:33,581 --> 01:06:35,650
Like if that was a woman that
came and created all of that,

1114
01:06:35,651 --> 01:06:38,890
like that's a valuable,
respectable,

1115
01:06:39,490 --> 01:06:43,020
fantastic thing that they just require
physical strength anyway. Don't,

1116
01:06:43,030 --> 01:06:46,150
don't diminish the a compliments to
someone else just because it doesn't fit

1117
01:06:46,210 --> 01:06:49,120
what you think is, well the
problem is when we get into teams,

1118
01:06:49,121 --> 01:06:51,850
man mean toxic tribalism
is the real problem.

1119
01:06:51,851 --> 01:06:53,500
The real problem is people get into teams,

1120
01:06:53,501 --> 01:06:57,340
whether it's male versus female
and this mayor of Durham Guarantee,

1121
01:06:57,370 --> 01:06:59,920
well it's weaponized.
A lot of this stuff is weaponized.

1122
01:06:59,921 --> 01:07:03,100
So most of the stuff about the patriarchy,

1123
01:07:03,101 --> 01:07:07,870
which I'm also in grants with Jordan
Peterson, you know that it doesn't exist.

1124
01:07:07,870 --> 01:07:11,470
That's not the way the human history has,
has rolled out.

1125
01:07:11,530 --> 01:07:15,940
I don't buy that at all. Not to men or
the wage gap. These are weaponized things.

1126
01:07:15,941 --> 01:07:20,530
They use them in a weaponized
way to try and destroy your,

1127
01:07:20,531 --> 01:07:23,270
your argument or your
position or your way of being.

1128
01:07:23,370 --> 01:07:25,930
It's a weaponized diminish
your point of view by saying,

1129
01:07:25,940 --> 01:07:28,390
tell me what's your white privilege
talking something like that.

1130
01:07:28,391 --> 01:07:32,320
A lot of white privilege today. I am
so white, a big white guy too. Very,

1131
01:07:32,321 --> 01:07:37,180
very white with a red beard from
the Pacific northwest. How much,

1132
01:07:37,181 --> 01:07:40,540
how much more white can you get?
If I get any wider,

1133
01:07:40,541 --> 01:07:45,541
I'm going to be wearing a
fucking Birkenstocks with
socks on ponytail and a and

1134
01:07:48,490 --> 01:07:52,680
wow man buttons, a Bolo
ponytail. But uh, it's, it's uh,

1135
01:07:53,020 --> 01:07:57,310
these are, these terms are used in,
in, in conflict. Well, and when,

1136
01:07:57,311 --> 01:07:59,420
why wouldn't they be?
Because most of the,

1137
01:07:59,421 --> 01:08:04,270
the source material that the creation
of these sorts of ideological viewpoints

1138
01:08:04,271 --> 01:08:06,040
are from postmodernist,
neo,

1139
01:08:06,041 --> 01:08:09,160
Marxism and it's all based on
the concept of conflict theory.

1140
01:08:09,161 --> 01:08:13,060
So there's always going to be an
oppressor and oppressed. So if you,

1141
01:08:13,061 --> 01:08:16,070
what you are doing is, uh, is trying to

1142
01:08:16,850 --> 01:08:20,900
argue with or even just make your case
to someone who's an oppressor. Well,

1143
01:08:20,901 --> 01:08:23,180
it would be weaponized because
as far as you're concerned,

1144
01:08:23,181 --> 01:08:26,750
everything they do is weaponized against
you. Right? So you've already chosen, uh,

1145
01:08:26,910 --> 01:08:29,720
a confrontational position.

1146
01:08:30,470 --> 01:08:35,160
There's also a problem with people wanting
to be right. That's human nature. Well,

1147
01:08:35,170 --> 01:08:40,170
I also like whether it's someone who's
a postmodernist or someone who was a

1148
01:08:40,330 --> 01:08:41,320
staunch conservative,

1149
01:08:41,620 --> 01:08:46,620
people go into any discussion with a pre
suppose or they have a preordained or

1150
01:08:47,391 --> 01:08:48,400
are pre,

1151
01:08:48,460 --> 01:08:53,460
they have a collected group of ideas
that they have attached themselves to and

1152
01:08:53,830 --> 01:08:56,920
they do not want to let those go.
And you have yours and I have mine.

1153
01:08:56,921 --> 01:09:00,940
It's very difficult for people to just
talk and very difficult for people to

1154
01:09:00,941 --> 01:09:02,910
just,
someone to lay out their,

1155
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:06,610
their position and someone else to lay
out their position and to people to like

1156
01:09:06,611 --> 01:09:10,420
cordially discuss the merits of each
position with an open mind. It's,

1157
01:09:10,450 --> 01:09:15,400
it happens so rarely and it's
something I try so hard to do.

1158
01:09:15,460 --> 01:09:16,610
And it's something that I,

1159
01:09:16,660 --> 01:09:21,460
it took me years to
cultivate the mindset to not,

1160
01:09:21,820 --> 01:09:26,290
not have these preexisting conditions or
preexisting ideas or if I do have them,

1161
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:30,460
don't attach myself to them and be what
ready to abandon them at any moment.

1162
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:32,530
Like under the under new evidence.

1163
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:35,660
Sure. And it's, there's no
problem in saying, okay,

1164
01:09:35,661 --> 01:09:40,661
well I believe a new believe B and
we both believe them to be correct.

1165
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:46,830
Well, tell me why I am, why Aa
is incorrect or bearing yet.

1166
01:09:46,970 --> 01:09:51,270
Tell me why you believe what you believe.
Right. You know, give me some reasons.

1167
01:09:51,330 --> 01:09:56,270
What are the facts and let's find
if those facts are real. It's right.

1168
01:09:56,300 --> 01:09:59,550
And I used to, uh, you know, I'd
have these conversations with,

1169
01:09:59,551 --> 01:10:04,490
with this person used to then I was
living with, I would say, they're like,

1170
01:10:04,491 --> 01:10:07,730
well, you just always have to
be right. I go, no, no, no,
no. I don't have to be right.

1171
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:09,140
But if you're going to make a claim,

1172
01:10:09,230 --> 01:10:11,690
you're going to have to defend
your argument and I'll defend mine.

1173
01:10:11,691 --> 01:10:14,120
But ultimately I don't care if I'm wrong.

1174
01:10:14,121 --> 01:10:18,530
Cause being wrong only means that I can
then perhaps work towards a way of being

1175
01:10:18,690 --> 01:10:20,660
the, having the most
understanding that I can have.

1176
01:10:20,690 --> 01:10:24,530
We as human beings are wrong so
much more than we're ever right,

1177
01:10:24,531 --> 01:10:26,570
but by being wrong,
but by making mistakes,

1178
01:10:26,930 --> 01:10:31,480
it's like a through martial arts by
being on the mats and you know, I,

1179
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:35,810
I'm going to get this guy's
ankle right now. Oh fuck that
up. I fucked that up. Oh,

1180
01:10:35,870 --> 01:10:40,370
I got caught up. Fuck that up. You can't
get to the point to where you're like, oh,

1181
01:10:40,610 --> 01:10:43,040
this is how you set it up.
This is the way that you can,

1182
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:46,270
I wasn't securing the knee well enough
so it was always sliding out of position

1183
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:47,240
and I couldn't,
you know,

1184
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:50,660
keep the leg framed in such a
position where when I applied my hold,

1185
01:10:50,870 --> 01:10:53,840
the pressure went through the
joint that I needed it to. Nothing.

1186
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:56,960
None of that happens until you
make mistake after mistake,

1187
01:10:56,990 --> 01:10:59,580
after mistake after mistake.
And there's nothing wrong with,

1188
01:10:59,581 --> 01:11:02,150
with before making them, uh, uh,

1189
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:07,250
moving forward on something to sit back
and to study a little bit and to try and

1190
01:11:07,251 --> 01:11:08,840
understand somewhat of the landscape.

1191
01:11:08,841 --> 01:11:12,040
But eventually the only thing you can
do is you just gotta go right now that

1192
01:11:12,041 --> 01:11:14,190
paralysis through isn't
gonna help you either.

1193
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:19,840
Well, I lived a good portion of my
life wanting to be right. Always. Sure.

1194
01:11:19,970 --> 01:11:22,610
And it's a toxic mindset.
It's terrible for you.

1195
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:24,440
It's terrible for you
because you don't grow.

1196
01:11:24,441 --> 01:11:25,970
And then you have to live in denial.

1197
01:11:26,180 --> 01:11:28,730
And then you have to always tell yourself
that you were right and they were

1198
01:11:28,731 --> 01:11:30,790
wrong. Even if you get, you know,

1199
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:34,070
out debated or even if you're
faced with new evidence, you,

1200
01:11:34,071 --> 01:11:38,300
you try to ignore that new evidence. I
know the mindset. I lived in it for many,

1201
01:11:38,301 --> 01:11:42,530
many to be, it's an easy place to normal
and you know, not too hard to go on.

1202
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:47,560
It's hard to relax yourself and
just realize that you are not facts.

1203
01:11:47,841 --> 01:11:51,320
You are not your ideas, your, uh,
not your opinions, your, your you,

1204
01:11:51,620 --> 01:11:55,580
and if you attach yourself
to these opinions, these
ideas, like you're going to,

1205
01:11:55,730 --> 01:11:59,300
it's a fucking trap. Like you have to
know what, like here's, here's something.

1206
01:11:59,301 --> 01:12:01,550
I know for a fact,
this wood is hard.

1207
01:12:01,700 --> 01:12:04,190
If I've hit this would meet with
my knuckles. That shit's hard.

1208
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:08,210
If it dropped on you, it would hurt.
These are undeniable facts and you,

1209
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:12,320
there's a gang of those that you have in
the world. There's a gang of undeniable,

1210
01:12:12,321 --> 01:12:14,810
if that's what I cut down. There's
things like objectivity. Yeah.

1211
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:19,770
Whether or not Marxism can be successfully
implemented in the large scale with a,

1212
01:12:19,771 --> 01:12:24,350
a sensitive, compassionate group of
human beings that all live together.

1213
01:12:25,180 --> 01:12:28,560
Who can it? I don't know. I don't,
it doesn't seem to be, yeah.

1214
01:12:28,561 --> 01:12:31,910
Well I don't know though. See what I'm
saying? Like this is a, this is a comp.

1215
01:12:31,940 --> 01:12:35,450
It hasn't been done before. Socialism
never really worked. But can it work?

1216
01:12:35,660 --> 01:12:37,280
Did the argument that it can't work.

1217
01:12:37,281 --> 01:12:40,340
It seems to me that doesn't
make any sense either.

1218
01:12:40,580 --> 01:12:44,270
Like maybe you could work well, the
argument that it could work is that, but,

1219
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:45,530
but see what I'm saying?
Like these are,

1220
01:12:45,740 --> 01:12:48,650
these are like really need
to think about Rod. Yeah.

1221
01:12:48,651 --> 01:12:53,651
Complex nuanced concepts that need to
be discussed up and down and back and

1222
01:12:54,501 --> 01:12:57,860
forth. And you also need to look
at the weight of human history,

1223
01:12:57,861 --> 01:13:00,080
the myriad times it's failed,

1224
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:03,150
right? And just human history.
And even in ways that,

1225
01:13:03,151 --> 01:13:05,190
which is not directly
related to say Marxism,

1226
01:13:05,191 --> 01:13:07,660
but just to look at
patterns and trends and,

1227
01:13:07,661 --> 01:13:12,240
and ways of people of
operating and to see how, okay,

1228
01:13:12,241 --> 01:13:13,830
we'll give it a different circumstance.

1229
01:13:14,010 --> 01:13:18,240
How would that process work within this
one or this one or this one or this one.

1230
01:13:18,510 --> 01:13:22,710
And then even if you wanted to say, well
if you, if you're like, well I don't,

1231
01:13:22,770 --> 01:13:23,980
I don't think Marxism work,

1232
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:28,080
well you can't say that until you actually
study what Marxism is and what its

1233
01:13:28,081 --> 01:13:31,320
principles are. Because if you
don't understand the argument,

1234
01:13:31,321 --> 01:13:33,600
and this is like you know John,
John Stuart Mill,

1235
01:13:33,930 --> 01:13:38,520
you can't just defend your side
without knowledge of the other. Yes,

1236
01:13:38,550 --> 01:13:41,850
you have really no position. Your
position isn't any better than theirs.

1237
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:43,190
Yeah,
that's a really good point.

1238
01:13:43,191 --> 01:13:46,340
I mean I think everybody should do
that no matter what you are looking at,

1239
01:13:46,341 --> 01:13:47,720
like whatever you're trying to defend,

1240
01:13:47,721 --> 01:13:52,010
look at even even if it's something
horrible and it's like a racist position,

1241
01:13:52,011 --> 01:13:53,520
find out why these people support it

1242
01:13:53,740 --> 01:13:57,150
so they believe it. Right and so what,
why do they believe this racist position?

1243
01:13:57,151 --> 01:14:01,830
What is it about them that they think
gives it validity and you can look at it

1244
01:14:01,831 --> 01:14:06,430
and go, I could see where they could take
this way too. It's extreme in that that,

1245
01:14:06,540 --> 01:14:09,780
I mean that's nonsensical but you see
where it started or you can see like that.

1246
01:14:09,781 --> 01:14:14,380
That's everything about this is clearly
driven by something else and not the not

1247
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:15,640
what they claim so

1248
01:14:16,050 --> 01:14:17,160
well it's also the,

1249
01:14:17,470 --> 01:14:20,400
one of the things about societies that
we really have to take into consideration

1250
01:14:20,401 --> 01:14:21,750
as the momentum of the past.

1251
01:14:22,020 --> 01:14:27,020
Like there's this country has unique
freedom to it because it was literally

1252
01:14:27,961 --> 01:14:32,880
created by people who decided to get
on a boat and risk traveling across the

1253
01:14:32,881 --> 01:14:34,430
ocean to some new lands.
Yes,

1254
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:39,390
it's a country filled with savages like
crazy people that took wild chances and

1255
01:14:39,391 --> 01:14:40,920
did wild things because of it.

1256
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:44,460
And if you look at the history of this
country that's clearly established by

1257
01:14:44,820 --> 01:14:46,920
look at the art,
look at the music,

1258
01:14:46,921 --> 01:14:49,050
look at the things that
have come out at the comedy,

1259
01:14:49,051 --> 01:14:51,060
all of his things that had been created,
the cars,

1260
01:14:51,061 --> 01:14:54,330
all the different things that
have come out of this one place.

1261
01:14:54,540 --> 01:14:59,160
And this one place just happens to be
the most recent place with the least

1262
01:14:59,161 --> 01:15:00,840
amount of historical baggage.
Yes.

1263
01:15:00,870 --> 01:15:03,780
But then you look at the places that have
the most amount of historical baggage

1264
01:15:03,781 --> 01:15:06,010
like Africa or you know,

1265
01:15:06,210 --> 01:15:10,770
some parts of Russia and like these are
places where they have the hardest time

1266
01:15:10,771 --> 01:15:15,300
breaking out of the weight of the cultural
momentum of the past. You know, it's,

1267
01:15:15,301 --> 01:15:17,010
it's very difficult for people to,

1268
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:22,400
to radically change an established system
that has existed for a thousand years.

1269
01:15:22,590 --> 01:15:26,090
Well, that's true. And if you were
to say, think about, you know,

1270
01:15:26,730 --> 01:15:29,420
communism and the Soviet states in the,

1271
01:15:29,421 --> 01:15:33,860
the length of what constitutes human
history is, has only been gone for,

1272
01:15:33,861 --> 01:15:34,351
it was only,

1273
01:15:34,351 --> 01:15:37,560
it was around for a short time and then
it's only been gone for an even shorter

1274
01:15:37,561 --> 01:15:38,060
time.

1275
01:15:38,060 --> 01:15:40,700
And it's not really like coming on Robin,
it's gone,

1276
01:15:40,701 --> 01:15:44,770
but it's still a dictatorship over
there. Uh, yeah, I guess their China,

1277
01:15:45,290 --> 01:15:49,010
Russia to share about that lady and
I ran, that's, she's going to jail.

1278
01:15:49,130 --> 01:15:53,750
The dancing and dancing. Yeah.
Oh No, the Egyptian girl,

1279
01:15:53,780 --> 01:15:57,320
the girl,
the Lebanese girls going to jail for she,

1280
01:15:57,410 --> 01:16:01,010
she made a youtube video about
getting sexually harassed in Egypt.

1281
01:16:01,490 --> 01:16:05,570
So they sentenced her to eight
years in prison. She's 22 years old.

1282
01:16:05,810 --> 01:16:10,520
Holy Fuck it terrifying.
She's a young 2124 or something like that.

1283
01:16:10,521 --> 01:16:15,110
She's young and they sentenced her to
eight fucking years. Pacha people here

1284
01:16:15,230 --> 01:16:20,060
in America or Western, the Western
civilization at large, just fucking,

1285
01:16:20,660 --> 01:16:24,200
they just put on the blinders about
stuff like that. It's like their places,

1286
01:16:24,530 --> 01:16:29,210
and I'm not going to demonize these
places either, but at the same time,

1287
01:16:30,890 --> 01:16:35,180
you as a 22 year old could have a
complaint and say, Hey, I am like,

1288
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:37,040
you know this thing happened and I'm,

1289
01:16:37,130 --> 01:16:39,770
this is fucked up and all of
a sudden they can go, Huh,

1290
01:16:39,860 --> 01:16:41,060
you think that was fucked up,

1291
01:16:41,180 --> 01:16:44,360
boom and throw your ass in jail or
have you executed or whatever. I mean,

1292
01:16:45,130 --> 01:16:49,190
it's like, okay, well I guess I don't
have the right to express myself. Whereas,

1293
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:49,970
you know,

1294
01:16:49,970 --> 01:16:54,800
people will show up and bang on doors and
do all kinds of crazy shit when Jordan

1295
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:59,300
Peterson comes and does a talk and
the thing is they're allowed to,

1296
01:16:59,301 --> 01:17:01,250
they're allowed to protest
what he has to say,

1297
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:06,450
counter protest if they want or to
express their unhappiness with things

1298
01:17:06,771 --> 01:17:08,750
political and things,
media,

1299
01:17:08,751 --> 01:17:13,160
why anybody can say what they want in
terms of what makes someone happy without

1300
01:17:13,580 --> 01:17:17,330
fear of the government silencing you.
Right.

1301
01:17:18,050 --> 01:17:19,150
That's a major thing.

1302
01:17:19,170 --> 01:17:22,920
It's a major thing. And this poor
girl, Iran, she's just dancing.

1303
01:17:23,100 --> 01:17:27,120
I know people that are always rail
against Islam or Islamophobia.

1304
01:17:27,330 --> 01:17:30,840
There's so much Islamophobia in this
world. Yeah, sure there is. You're,

1305
01:17:30,860 --> 01:17:32,940
you're right. There is, but
you know what else there is,

1306
01:17:33,060 --> 01:17:37,380
there's also radical Islam and radical
Islamic governments that are putting

1307
01:17:37,381 --> 01:17:39,710
women in jail because they
fucking dance religious.

1308
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:42,370
And that's actually right now it's
just resist religious zealotry

1309
01:17:42,390 --> 01:17:45,620
training. And while I have, you
know, people will often, you know,

1310
01:17:45,660 --> 01:17:47,460
we'll get into a conversation
about this and they'll bring up,

1311
01:17:47,461 --> 01:17:49,470
well what about the Crusades? Or
what about this? Like A, hold on.

1312
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:51,240
These are all relevant things to,

1313
01:17:51,241 --> 01:17:54,540
and while the Crusades are not nearly
as cut and dry as you think they are,

1314
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:55,560
in fact,
which two?

1315
01:17:55,561 --> 01:17:59,380
It ended in like the fourth crusade
to two groups went down there, uh,

1316
01:17:59,390 --> 01:18:02,820
and then end up fighting each other. It's
like a, you're both Christians. Yeah.

1317
01:18:02,821 --> 01:18:03,810
What the fuck are you thinking?

1318
01:18:03,811 --> 01:18:06,240
But then you had things like
the inquisition you have,

1319
01:18:06,450 --> 01:18:10,940
you've had all kinds of stuff and it's
like, yeah, no, you, you, you just,

1320
01:18:11,010 --> 01:18:14,490
that doesn't erase this. And that doesn't,
they don't balance each other out.

1321
01:18:16,170 --> 01:18:19,970
And it's because it's one religion and
not the other. It doesn't make, it's the,

1322
01:18:19,971 --> 01:18:22,680
the, the motivations are
the same. It kind of comes,

1323
01:18:22,681 --> 01:18:26,100
it comes from the same concept. Even if
it's not technically the same religion.

1324
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:28,230
Well, it reinforces it
in my opinion. I mean,

1325
01:18:28,231 --> 01:18:32,340
the idea that it's not the idea that
Christianity is so amazing and Islam is so

1326
01:18:32,341 --> 01:18:37,170
bad, it's that ideologies forced people
into very terrible behave. They can,

1327
01:18:37,171 --> 01:18:40,450
they can very, very much. And
they often do. Yeah. I mean,

1328
01:18:40,530 --> 01:18:43,680
most of the time it goes bad
when you have a powerful,

1329
01:18:43,681 --> 01:18:46,100
potent ideology that is dominating

1330
01:18:46,490 --> 01:18:49,140
well imagine. Okay, you had, um,

1331
01:18:49,370 --> 01:18:54,370
Christian zealotry and let's say Islam
and Christianity had swapped and Islam

1332
01:18:55,401 --> 01:18:59,210
had all kinds of reformations
and different sex break
off from it and all this,

1333
01:18:59,211 --> 01:19:01,670
and it'd become more like
Christianity is in this modern era,

1334
01:19:01,671 --> 01:19:06,671
but Christianity's stayed in a more
less developed sense and had a more

1335
01:19:06,830 --> 01:19:11,450
rigorous, uh, fervent zealotry in terms
of adherence to doctrines or at least,

1336
01:19:11,451 --> 01:19:14,160
or even, uh, uh,

1337
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:16,790
interpretations of doctrines
in certain ways to MIT style.

1338
01:19:17,780 --> 01:19:21,380
But within this context of the modern era.
So now you have the Internet.

1339
01:19:21,381 --> 01:19:23,960
So any you would say,
you know,

1340
01:19:23,961 --> 01:19:28,580
you only got like a million people
in the world that feel this way,

1341
01:19:28,581 --> 01:19:31,610
but these million can all connect with
each other via social media of your

1342
01:19:31,611 --> 01:19:35,490
different electronic
ways. They can create, um,

1343
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:39,560
weapon where they can weaponize
things much easier. They
can coordinate, they can.

1344
01:19:39,590 --> 01:19:44,590
It's not like the Crusades where you
had to get money from a king and other

1345
01:19:45,620 --> 01:19:49,220
government, other monarchs get
together. All these troops get together,

1346
01:19:49,221 --> 01:19:50,240
all these supplies,

1347
01:19:50,390 --> 01:19:54,980
marched them all down into the Middle
East to where you've got the Turks waiting

1348
01:19:54,981 --> 01:19:56,600
for you,
that they've done the same thing.

1349
01:19:56,601 --> 01:19:59,750
And then you guys all meet up on
these different points of battle. The,

1350
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:04,790
you could literally be at war
all over the world, all day,

1351
01:20:04,940 --> 01:20:09,780
every day, all at the same time because
of the modern advances of technology.

1352
01:20:09,870 --> 01:20:11,520
And not to mention you have firearms,

1353
01:20:11,521 --> 01:20:16,521
you have a explosive and chemicals and
things that you can use to your disposal.

1354
01:20:16,830 --> 01:20:20,970
Drones, it just a or a truck. Yeah,
right. You didn't have, you know,

1355
01:20:20,971 --> 01:20:25,500
six ton trucks and drive
in to drive into a crowd.

1356
01:20:25,660 --> 01:20:30,120
Um, that's just technology.
It's, it, it helps,

1357
01:20:30,121 --> 01:20:32,580
it makes our lives better.
But in, in other ways,

1358
01:20:32,581 --> 01:20:36,660
it can also create calamity for us.
And it's really their tools. You know,

1359
01:20:36,661 --> 01:20:39,090
social media is a tool.
I think the social media is,

1360
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:44,310
if you were to track mass,
the mass shootings that have happened,

1361
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:47,490
the rise of social media and the
rise of mass shootings would,

1362
01:20:47,540 --> 01:20:48,630
would be on a parallel.

1363
01:20:48,930 --> 01:20:52,780
I really think that it's social media
that's increasing the amount that you see

1364
01:20:52,781 --> 01:20:54,270
at the school shooting
and things like that.

1365
01:20:54,271 --> 01:20:55,800
I think that's because
they get fame from it.

1366
01:20:56,250 --> 01:21:00,780
They get fame or you're able to antagonize
someone and they can't get away from

1367
01:21:00,781 --> 01:21:03,570
you much more easily. Uh, the,

1368
01:21:03,730 --> 01:21:07,880
the resulting mom using a Nietzschean
term in terms of, uh, you know,

1369
01:21:08,130 --> 01:21:09,420
the resentment,

1370
01:21:09,630 --> 01:21:13,830
the resentfulness from seeing other people
having what you think you deserve or,

1371
01:21:14,070 --> 01:21:14,903
or doing,

1372
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:20,240
thinking that they somehow are having
more of what you think you want that as

1373
01:21:21,391 --> 01:21:23,130
well. Why do they get
to have it? And I don't,

1374
01:21:23,131 --> 01:21:28,131
or any number of reasons why you can be
incredibly potently resentful and now

1375
01:21:28,891 --> 01:21:33,330
you have this thing that's just in your
life pumping all this kind of stuff that

1376
01:21:33,331 --> 01:21:34,200
you all the time.

1377
01:21:34,201 --> 01:21:39,201
And I think that it can affect people
in some really pathologically bad ways.

1378
01:21:40,050 --> 01:21:44,470
And now you have technology to also
enact it. And if it's not in the eye,

1379
01:21:44,471 --> 01:21:47,220
and you can also easily make the
argument if it's not a firearm,

1380
01:21:47,230 --> 01:21:50,730
it could be something else. And, and
that's doesn't make it any better.

1381
01:21:50,820 --> 01:21:55,320
But I think that the, the rise
of social media has been, is,

1382
01:21:55,330 --> 01:21:58,650
is a direct, uh, correlator.

1383
01:21:59,290 --> 01:22:03,120
It's directly responsible for the rising
and the school shootings and directly

1384
01:22:03,121 --> 01:22:06,330
responsible or directly correlates to it.

1385
01:22:06,420 --> 01:22:09,270
I think that there's a correlation there.
I think it's certainly,

1386
01:22:09,271 --> 01:22:12,900
there's a lot going on in society.
I think the big factor, well,

1387
01:22:12,930 --> 01:22:15,230
there's a lot of factors.
People are alienated. Yes,

1388
01:22:15,240 --> 01:22:19,800
there's terrible child rearing.
People have mental health issues,

1389
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:23,730
people are medicated. Does the big
one is now imagine all that with the,

1390
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:28,920
the technology of social media able to
heighten some of the effects of some of

1391
01:22:28,921 --> 01:22:31,950
these things or to create,

1392
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:33,930
so someone that feels alienated.

1393
01:22:34,830 --> 01:22:38,790
Imagine now not only do you feel
alienated in the real world,

1394
01:22:39,180 --> 01:22:43,250
but then when you're on social media,
you, one, it's not a real, you know,

1395
01:22:43,251 --> 01:22:45,150
it's your body knows
it's not the real world,

1396
01:22:45,151 --> 01:22:46,830
but you could be alienated out there too.

1397
01:22:46,831 --> 01:22:51,540
And that which alienates you there could
still penetrate and get to you while

1398
01:22:51,541 --> 01:22:53,010
you're out.
What you're away from it.

1399
01:22:53,190 --> 01:22:56,100
If people are fucking with you at school
or what have you and then you're at

1400
01:22:56,101 --> 01:22:57,590
home,
you're feeling alienated there.

1401
01:22:58,710 --> 01:23:02,940
This is continuing to fuck with you
through social media or other people are

1402
01:23:02,941 --> 01:23:04,840
fucking with you on social
media would say you're,

1403
01:23:04,860 --> 01:23:07,180
you're playing your video games and
people are talking shit cause you keep

1404
01:23:07,181 --> 01:23:11,590
getting shot and you know a battlefield
five or whatever and then all these

1405
01:23:11,591 --> 01:23:16,240
things are just compounding compounding.
And while no one knows, I mean there's,

1406
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:19,570
I'm sure you wouldn't necessarily
know that if I say, oh you know,

1407
01:23:19,571 --> 01:23:23,980
fuck you knew or something on some video
game that this person is essentially in

1408
01:23:23,981 --> 01:23:25,960
real life being told fuck you every day,

1409
01:23:26,230 --> 01:23:29,530
all day feeling like the
whole world thinks fuck you.

1410
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:32,260
How would you know that?

1411
01:23:32,530 --> 01:23:37,480
But it could be then that person
snaps or that person has a,

1412
01:23:37,540 --> 01:23:39,970
there they have a psychological
issue that they're not,

1413
01:23:40,300 --> 01:23:42,910
I'm sure there's a bunch of factors.
There's a bunch of facts. First of all,

1414
01:23:42,911 --> 01:23:46,900
does the ability to kill large groups of
people, which is unprecedented, right?

1415
01:23:46,901 --> 01:23:51,160
The ability to use assault rifles and
just fucking semiautomatic guns and going

1416
01:23:51,161 --> 01:23:55,120
in to kill large groups of people. The,
the knowledge that if you do do that,

1417
01:23:55,121 --> 01:23:59,920
it'll make a huge splash and
giant headlines and you'll
be, you'll be infamous.

1418
01:24:00,030 --> 01:24:02,890
The, the fact that a lot of these
people are on disassociative.

1419
01:24:02,891 --> 01:24:07,060
So a lot of these people are on like
serious psych medications that we really

1420
01:24:07,061 --> 01:24:11,980
have only been studying the effects
on human beings for the past couple of

1421
01:24:11,980 --> 01:24:12,570
decades.
There's,

1422
01:24:12,570 --> 01:24:16,720
there's not a whole lot of data on
longterm use of these SSRI is correct.

1423
01:24:16,721 --> 01:24:20,440
2030 40 years. Right. So
you've got varying people's,

1424
01:24:20,441 --> 01:24:21,940
a varying mental illnesses,

1425
01:24:21,941 --> 01:24:26,941
varying psychological pressures and
stresses and lives that are just beyond

1426
01:24:27,881 --> 01:24:28,421
fucked.

1427
01:24:28,421 --> 01:24:32,200
And then they have access to guns and
they want people to hurt the way they're

1428
01:24:32,201 --> 01:24:34,870
hurting. There's a lot of that,
there's a lot of factors going on.

1429
01:24:34,940 --> 01:24:38,280
Well and you know, even if they
illegally require the guns, I mean they,

1430
01:24:38,281 --> 01:24:43,250
they still, I mean it doesn't matter, but
in this case with the tool is per se. But

1431
01:24:44,110 --> 01:24:46,750
well, you know, I don't think
we're meant to, to understand,

1432
01:24:46,780 --> 01:24:48,160
I don't think we understand,

1433
01:24:48,161 --> 01:24:53,050
nor are we meant to live in large
groups of people where we don't know the

1434
01:24:53,051 --> 01:24:54,520
people around us.
That's another thing.

1435
01:24:54,521 --> 01:24:58,870
I think that is a really new
situation for human beings.

1436
01:24:59,260 --> 01:25:01,090
And they overlook the historic

1437
01:25:01,100 --> 01:25:05,900
go significance of the population growth,
the, the population density that has,

1438
01:25:05,950 --> 01:25:10,850
uh, been, uh, gathering as these
wheat dense, we get into these,

1439
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:15,170
these, uh, high density,
civilized, civilized areas
like cities, these big cities.

1440
01:25:15,171 --> 01:25:17,810
And it changes everything.

1441
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,880
Yeah. And people are less
likely to know that many.

1442
01:25:21,030 --> 01:25:25,020
Like if you live in a town of 150 people,
you probably know 150 people.

1443
01:25:25,290 --> 01:25:29,640
If you live in a city of 5 million people,
you probably know 10 people you know,

1444
01:25:29,641 --> 01:25:32,790
you know, people you work with, you
might know a couple of friends, you know,

1445
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:35,100
unless you're like a really social person.
Sure.

1446
01:25:35,220 --> 01:25:39,360
You probably have a way more limited
number of people that you actually know.

1447
01:25:39,810 --> 01:25:43,740
Then people that have a tight knit,
small town and small community.

1448
01:25:44,070 --> 01:25:47,070
But you know those people are obviously
in your business. That's one thing.

1449
01:25:47,340 --> 01:25:51,390
If you haven't fucking, I know
friends that live in small
towns. Fuck man. There's,

1450
01:25:51,391 --> 01:25:54,390
there's things that come with that too.
A lot of busy bodies.

1451
01:25:54,720 --> 01:25:57,960
People peeking over the fence.
I think they had the anal sex last night.

1452
01:25:59,310 --> 01:26:00,580
Jesus is going to punish them.

1453
01:26:00,630 --> 01:26:03,320
Glad when he says next line
in store and come through.

1454
01:26:03,321 --> 01:26:05,960
You don't fuck no one live,
but fucking

1455
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:12,170
speaking of blood fucking let's talk
about you saw yeah. Without the loop.

1456
01:26:12,470 --> 01:26:13,970
Yeah. We were, um, we,

1457
01:26:13,980 --> 01:26:17,960
we started this podcast talking
about what we talked about your,

1458
01:26:17,961 --> 01:26:22,940
your situation with Brendan Chub and I
had talked about your situation where you

1459
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:27,410
a war, you tested positive
from a tainted supplement,

1460
01:26:27,680 --> 01:26:32,060
like legitimately tested positive
from a tainted supplement. It,

1461
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:36,910
you were cleared, but this whole
process was a goat rope. Yeah,

1462
01:26:36,950 --> 01:26:41,600
right. It took a long time to work out
and you didn't feel like you were fairly

1463
01:26:41,601 --> 01:26:42,000
treated.

1464
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:46,350
Not In the least. It, it, uh, it started
one way, then took a fucking curve.

1465
01:26:46,890 --> 01:26:49,420
What happened? Well,
so what did you take a,

1466
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:53,040
I took a supplement that had
tribulus in it. That's all.

1467
01:26:53,041 --> 01:26:55,300
It was just a Chinese herb.

1468
01:26:55,370 --> 01:26:58,370
It's a Chinese herb that stimulates
testosterone and by the way,

1469
01:26:58,440 --> 01:27:00,750
barely works. Yeah. It's not, it's not a,

1470
01:27:00,780 --> 01:27:03,620
it's not going to turn you into
superman or anything like that.

1471
01:27:03,630 --> 01:27:07,440
You get more sleep. It's better for your
testosterone production than Tribulus.

1472
01:27:07,470 --> 01:27:10,920
So it's just tribulus is all it was.
And uh,

1473
01:27:11,730 --> 01:27:15,960
they in it, the, the supplement
itself, as it turns out,

1474
01:27:15,961 --> 01:27:20,160
was contaminated with a
sore arm called Asta Room.

1475
01:27:20,520 --> 01:27:22,860
But when I say contaminated,
I mean like,

1476
01:27:22,861 --> 01:27:27,360
it had such trace amounts that the people
that did the lab testing on it said,

1477
01:27:27,361 --> 01:27:30,330
well, it's clearly just contamination
because this wouldn't help you.

1478
01:27:30,331 --> 01:27:31,980
This wouldn't do anything for you.

1479
01:27:32,470 --> 01:27:35,140
Let's explain how that happens.
A lot of these places.

1480
01:27:35,141 --> 01:27:39,970
I know this for a fact because I am one
of the owners of on it on it is a third

1481
01:27:39,971 --> 01:27:44,971
party tested company where we get our
stuff tested by an independent party to

1482
01:27:45,251 --> 01:27:46,990
make sure that there's
nothing funky with it.

1483
01:27:46,991 --> 01:27:49,480
But we've had some issues in the
past with stuff being in our,

1484
01:27:49,740 --> 01:27:52,690
with our earliest formulations of Alpha
brain and weren't supposed to be in

1485
01:27:52,691 --> 01:27:57,100
there. And what it comes from is you
buy your ingredients from a company,

1486
01:27:57,220 --> 01:28:01,120
the company has these vats that they mix
everything in and they don't properly

1487
01:28:01,121 --> 01:28:03,690
clean the vats and if they
don't properly clean the that,

1488
01:28:03,700 --> 01:28:07,570
so you're buying some stuff from China
who knows what they're chucking in there.

1489
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:10,420
They got steroids in there,
they got this, they got that.

1490
01:28:10,450 --> 01:28:13,180
A lot of creatine is tainted,
were all sorts of shit.

1491
01:28:13,181 --> 01:28:15,340
A lot of different supplements or taint.
And that's what you saw it.

1492
01:28:15,341 --> 01:28:19,840
I thought it could have been at first.
[inaudible] means yes, it happened to uh,

1493
01:28:20,140 --> 01:28:20,980
Ell Ramiro.

1494
01:28:21,070 --> 01:28:26,070
Yes. So this stuff is, is,
is contaminated. Right.

1495
01:28:26,100 --> 01:28:29,360
And so you signed up
was, was testing me. I,

1496
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:34,520
I had had a fight in September of 2016
against our Lawsky and then after that I

1497
01:28:36,001 --> 01:28:39,900
was like, Yo, I'm just going to take a
break for a while. I'm not fighting for,

1498
01:28:39,930 --> 01:28:43,550
I'm going to tour Europe and goof off and
whatever. And then when I get back, uh,

1499
01:28:43,570 --> 01:28:44,520
you know,
I don't really,

1500
01:28:44,640 --> 01:28:48,840
I don't know what I'm going to get back
in the ring and they're like, all right,

1501
01:28:48,870 --> 01:28:52,110
whatever. And we UFC, we told
them and I, but you saw it,

1502
01:28:52,111 --> 01:28:54,960
it would still come around and
test and say, okay, fine, whatever.

1503
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:58,620
So this is post testing
positive. This is pre. Pre. Okay.

1504
01:28:58,700 --> 01:29:02,040
And so you fought Arlovski and you said,
I'm just going to chill a while. Yeah. And

1505
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:05,790
then one day, um, well like for one,

1506
01:29:05,791 --> 01:29:08,250
when I'm out there in Europe
and I let them know like, Hey,

1507
01:29:08,251 --> 01:29:13,251
I'm going fucking where the wind
takes me in Europe and I don't have a

1508
01:29:13,861 --> 01:29:17,640
whereabouts to fill in because I could
be on a train moving here, moving there,

1509
01:29:17,641 --> 01:29:21,030
whatever, which is your prerogative,
right as a human being. And they,

1510
01:29:21,420 --> 01:29:24,720
they know that and yet then they go ahead
and sent someone to my fucking house

1511
01:29:24,721 --> 01:29:27,600
to try and test me while I'm in
Europe and I'm just going, Whoa, okay.

1512
01:29:28,530 --> 01:29:32,670
Isn't there like an APP we've filled out
as an APP? But if I'm at work, you have,

1513
01:29:32,671 --> 01:29:35,580
you can fill out what you're supposed
to be ahead of time for the most part.

1514
01:29:36,240 --> 01:29:41,240
So on Tuesday the 16th I'm going to be
at this place from this time to this time

1515
01:29:41,821 --> 01:29:43,800
and then, and then, but
what is your home base?

1516
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:47,210
So if we don't go to these places and
we'll just meet you at your home at some

1517
01:29:47,211 --> 01:29:50,910
time or whatever. He just decided to go
to Japan. Yeah. Do you have to tell them,

1518
01:29:50,911 --> 01:29:53,790
hey,
today I'm going to take a train to Osaka.

1519
01:29:53,910 --> 01:29:55,630
Today I'm going to go to the mountains.

1520
01:29:56,210 --> 01:29:59,750
So you have to give them a detailed
itinerary every day. Every day. Okay.

1521
01:30:00,060 --> 01:30:02,920
And so I'm like, fuck dude. I'm
just trying to be out here living,

1522
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:06,240
just doing whatever. I'm not fighting,
but you know, when I get home,

1523
01:30:06,241 --> 01:30:10,110
you test me wherever you want. Do you
just want, wanted to enjoy a vacation,

1524
01:30:10,140 --> 01:30:14,640
just travel. Correct. And uh, they go,
they send someone in my house. I was like,

1525
01:30:14,641 --> 01:30:17,250
fuck. All right. And then
there are times where,

1526
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:19,770
so what happens when they send someone
to your house but you told them you

1527
01:30:19,771 --> 01:30:23,850
weren't there? Uh, well for one,
no one told the, I don't know how,

1528
01:30:23,910 --> 01:30:28,140
what mechanical elements within
their organization, how that works.

1529
01:30:28,141 --> 01:30:30,960
But they sent someone there anyways.
I'm not there.

1530
01:30:30,961 --> 01:30:34,400
That head count.
Does it count cause you,

1531
01:30:34,410 --> 01:30:37,620
did you tell them that you were
going to be on the road? I, we did.

1532
01:30:38,610 --> 01:30:41,990
So they still counted that as you
not being there for a test? Yes.

1533
01:30:42,690 --> 01:30:46,410
Well that doesn't make any fucking
sense. Well it is what it is. So,

1534
01:30:47,100 --> 01:30:52,020
but wait a minute, if they're going to
give you a strike, like don't, don't,

1535
01:30:52,021 --> 01:30:54,750
they have to follow their
protocol and their protocols.

1536
01:30:54,751 --> 01:30:58,260
You have to inform them or where are you
going to be? Right. Because you did that,

1537
01:30:58,500 --> 01:30:59,850
you inform them more.
You're going to be

1538
01:31:01,570 --> 01:31:05,370
my manager literally told
Novitsky and the UFC,

1539
01:31:05,880 --> 01:31:10,880
he's not going to be home for almost
a month and he's fucking practically

1540
01:31:11,611 --> 01:31:14,670
backpacking all through Europe
going from place to place to place.

1541
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:19,350
So he's going to be real hard to get
ahold of. Good time to take steroids.

1542
01:31:19,540 --> 01:31:23,840
The Oh yeah. Get just,
just fucking give it back

1543
01:31:25,650 --> 01:31:29,130
to the gills. Yeah. You'll pass.
If they showed up in Europe,

1544
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:33,000
you did give them your location and you
told them where you are if they would,

1545
01:31:33,001 --> 01:31:36,540
but I was gone. I didn't feel in any
locations. I just went wherever I went.

1546
01:31:36,870 --> 01:31:38,040
So when you went,

1547
01:31:38,041 --> 01:31:41,940
wherever you went and your manager told
you solder that you were in Europe,

1548
01:31:41,970 --> 01:31:44,880
they still showed up at your house in La.
Okay.

1549
01:31:45,090 --> 01:31:48,930
Well that doesn't seem to make any sense.
And then they give you a strike. Yes.

1550
01:31:49,420 --> 01:31:54,360
Hmm. So I'm like, okay, that's aggravating
cowboy a strike when he was at UFC.

1551
01:31:54,450 --> 01:31:57,900
Yeah. Yeah. So it's stuff like that. And
I saw that and I'm like, you know what,

1552
01:31:57,901 --> 01:32:01,540
I just, I can't fuck around
with any of this stuff.

1553
01:32:01,540 --> 01:32:06,540
I don't want people to use this as some
sort of a kindling to try and start a

1554
01:32:07,121 --> 01:32:11,710
fire about me. And so then I get back
home and they're, you know, test me again,

1555
01:32:11,711 --> 01:32:15,460
like, all right, fine, whatever. And then
they test me again and I'm like, okay,

1556
01:32:16,210 --> 01:32:19,540
now you may just made me late to an
audition as you just showed up out of

1557
01:32:19,541 --> 01:32:23,860
nowhere. Cool. You can do that.
Like they can just show up.

1558
01:32:23,950 --> 01:32:27,880
You can't say, Hey, I have an
appointment to keep their there.

1559
01:32:28,790 --> 01:32:31,060
But even if you are not fighting,

1560
01:32:31,630 --> 01:32:34,360
like say if you're running out the door
and you have a business appointment,

1561
01:32:34,361 --> 01:32:37,480
how long does it take for them to test
you? A, it depends on what they're doing,

1562
01:32:37,481 --> 01:32:40,050
whether it's blood and
urine or just urine.

1563
01:32:40,160 --> 01:32:43,840
But with me it's always been blood
in urine. So you can't say, hey,

1564
01:32:43,841 --> 01:32:46,060
you guys are going to have
to come with me because, uh,

1565
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:49,060
I got to go to this fucking audition.
You know, I dunno, I didn't try that.

1566
01:32:49,300 --> 01:32:52,340
I would say that get in the car,
bitch, boom, boom, boom. Well,

1567
01:32:52,510 --> 01:32:55,540
how are you going to sit there and have
someone draw blood and not going to you?

1568
01:32:55,541 --> 01:32:57,100
You guys are going to have
to deal when I'm done,

1569
01:32:57,820 --> 01:33:00,340
like if you want to keep an eye on me,
come with me the whole way.

1570
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:02,770
I always took it as they showed
up. It's like, well here it goes.

1571
01:33:02,890 --> 01:33:04,270
That doesn't seem to make any sense.

1572
01:33:04,271 --> 01:33:08,170
If you have previous commitments
and you have to do something,

1573
01:33:08,410 --> 01:33:11,410
they shouldn't have like ultimate
precedent over your life.

1574
01:33:11,440 --> 01:33:16,370
Like they shouldn't be able to just decide
like showing up random that I sent it

1575
01:33:16,371 --> 01:33:18,760
as they could. They could make
an argument in some way on that.

1576
01:33:18,761 --> 01:33:22,720
But if you have a life, well, in any case,
so okay, I take this test and I'm like,

1577
01:33:22,721 --> 01:33:26,110
all right,
I'm just going to retire for now.

1578
01:33:26,440 --> 01:33:30,190
I got too much shit I got to do.
I'm not fighting anytime soon.

1579
01:33:30,280 --> 01:33:34,870
I've got my new Japan stuff, I've got
auditions, I've got all these things.

1580
01:33:34,871 --> 01:33:39,400
I'm traveling and I just, I'm not going
to fight. Right. So just leave me be,

1581
01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:43,540
and then I'm in Japan and the fucking,

1582
01:33:43,570 --> 01:33:48,040
the very last test I took
right before retiring.

1583
01:33:48,730 --> 01:33:52,540
Oh, you're flagged. I'm like,
you gotta be fucking kidding me.

1584
01:33:53,050 --> 01:33:57,730
Really, really all these
tests over all these years,

1585
01:33:57,910 --> 01:34:02,440
me being the first person to do complete
out of competition or in competition,

1586
01:34:02,441 --> 01:34:05,530
random urine and blood testing.

1587
01:34:05,531 --> 01:34:09,010
When I worked with a Wada and the Nevada
state athletic commission when I fought

1588
01:34:09,011 --> 01:34:12,730
Travis Browne. So no one had ever
done actual random testing before.

1589
01:34:12,731 --> 01:34:16,180
And there was no, you saw to involve
in the UFC yet going through,

1590
01:34:16,181 --> 01:34:17,014
why did you do that?

1591
01:34:17,230 --> 01:34:22,230
It was something that the NSAC
wanted to see done and I'm like,

1592
01:34:22,391 --> 01:34:23,171
fine.
Know what?

1593
01:34:23,171 --> 01:34:25,600
I wanted to see that done because
you had tested positive in the past.

1594
01:34:25,870 --> 01:34:26,690
And so I was like,

1595
01:34:26,690 --> 01:34:29,620
you tested positive before in the
past you've taken some stuff. Right.

1596
01:34:29,650 --> 01:34:32,410
I tested positive for
antibiotics in the past. Why?

1597
01:34:32,411 --> 01:34:35,740
But I mean the supplement market used to
be way wilder than it used to be. Well,

1598
01:34:35,741 --> 01:34:40,690
and also we'll end the way.
The just fighting was way
wild riding was way wilder.

1599
01:34:40,720 --> 01:34:42,240
The supplement industry was way wilder.

1600
01:34:42,290 --> 01:34:45,790
It's like back in Oh two you could still
buy all this shit over the counter.

1601
01:34:45,791 --> 01:34:48,430
That bio for got
reclassified the steroids.

1602
01:34:48,431 --> 01:34:51,750
I remember I was taking this shit called
Mag 10 do you have that higher number

1603
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:55,570
mag? Ooh, what was the name of the
company that makes that a death?

1604
01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:58,100
Incorporate ethic cooperated.
She I should

1605
01:34:58,100 --> 01:35:02,330
is all steroids. Shit was
steroids. It was steroids. 100%.

1606
01:35:02,360 --> 01:35:05,450
I remember meg 10 he came like 10
pounds in six weeks on that shit.

1607
01:35:05,451 --> 01:35:08,150
You just get Jack. But that
was all over the counter. Yeah.

1608
01:35:08,200 --> 01:35:10,220
You used to be able to buy a lot of stuff.
And by the way,

1609
01:35:10,221 --> 01:35:12,290
liver toxicity is probably off the charts.

1610
01:35:12,420 --> 01:35:14,960
Probably was a lot of those things
that are like super bad for you. Yeah.

1611
01:35:15,190 --> 01:35:19,890
But real effective, they fucking it
work. This stuff worked. But uh, so,

1612
01:35:19,940 --> 01:35:24,020
you know, there was a whole different
era. And then with California,

1613
01:35:24,680 --> 01:35:27,710
you know, I, I had an issue
with, with a contaminant,

1614
01:35:27,711 --> 01:35:30,710
what I believe ultimately
to be a contamination,

1615
01:35:30,711 --> 01:35:33,710
but I didn't take all the
steps that I had this time.

1616
01:35:34,250 --> 01:35:36,850
And once that whole process
was such a mother fuck,

1617
01:35:37,330 --> 01:35:41,540
like this is never going to happen again.
So every supplement lot that I took,

1618
01:35:41,570 --> 01:35:45,280
I would always keep bits of it
behind for until I knew I could get,

1619
01:35:45,290 --> 01:35:48,320
I felt there was enough time it expired
and get rid of it because no one's going

1620
01:35:48,321 --> 01:35:51,650
to come back and test me.
I passed all my tests so,

1621
01:35:51,740 --> 01:35:54,060
so once you pass your test you
would get rid of the old site.

1622
01:35:54,080 --> 01:35:55,410
I don't need to keep those lots in.

1623
01:35:55,411 --> 01:35:58,160
You're supposed to take the
only third party verified.

1624
01:35:58,280 --> 01:36:02,660
That's not what they say necessarily.
They suggest it I guess now.

1625
01:36:02,690 --> 01:36:06,560
But I know that uh,
with this brand of Tribulus I had taken,

1626
01:36:06,970 --> 01:36:11,420
I had taken three or four different other
supplements from the same company and

1627
01:36:11,421 --> 01:36:13,200
all pass no problem on their tests.

1628
01:36:13,330 --> 01:36:16,850
So it was just some weird
contamination which does happen again.

1629
01:36:16,970 --> 01:36:18,320
It happened at Tim means,
yes,

1630
01:36:18,321 --> 01:36:20,900
it's happened to several
fight as far as I can tell.

1631
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:22,940
I mean I'm not testing
their whole product line,

1632
01:36:22,970 --> 01:36:26,360
but it just seemed like a fluke
and just such a simple supplement.

1633
01:36:26,390 --> 01:36:30,770
In any case over one ingredient deal. So
then they come back and they're like, oh,

1634
01:36:30,771 --> 01:36:34,400
you tested positive for this. And I'm
like, well, that ain't fucking possible.

1635
01:36:34,850 --> 01:36:38,660
So then I send in some supplements, which
I had to pay for to have them tested.

1636
01:36:39,200 --> 01:36:42,290
They run them through the testing and
then bang, they find it all right.

1637
01:36:42,650 --> 01:36:47,270
There you go. There's your deal. Then they
went out and bought a brand new bottle,

1638
01:36:47,330 --> 01:36:51,260
unopened. Same Lot tested
that one. Verify the results.

1639
01:36:51,770 --> 01:36:55,250
Same thing. Test, same thing. Doesn't
happen then Tim means as well.

1640
01:36:55,310 --> 01:36:59,360
So then you were in contact with
Usada throughout the entirety of this.

1641
01:36:59,510 --> 01:37:04,460
So we don't ever break contact with
Usada. Uh, we have a specific guy,

1642
01:37:04,480 --> 01:37:05,870
and I'm not gonna throw his
name out there or anything,

1643
01:37:05,871 --> 01:37:09,540
but we have a guy that we spoke
to directly the whole time, uh,

1644
01:37:09,560 --> 01:37:13,400
through my manager, uh, speaking
with him and I've seen the emails.

1645
01:37:14,120 --> 01:37:18,510
And so we're talking about how we know
this is a contamination. And when,

1646
01:37:18,780 --> 01:37:20,630
you know,
when we get done with all this,

1647
01:37:20,990 --> 01:37:25,060
why don't we even try to put
together something, some,

1648
01:37:25,061 --> 01:37:26,300
some promotional stuff,

1649
01:37:26,330 --> 01:37:29,150
anything that we can do to try and keep
athletes from ending up in the same

1650
01:37:29,151 --> 01:37:32,420
issues. And we, we'd like to do whatever
we could to help you guys out with this.

1651
01:37:32,500 --> 01:37:34,410
You know, we're not against you. We're a,

1652
01:37:34,530 --> 01:37:38,360
we don't mind being a part of the system
and we understand why you're here.

1653
01:37:39,230 --> 01:37:43,070
And I'm not against them wanting to do
drug testing or whatever and try to keep

1654
01:37:43,080 --> 01:37:47,630
a, a, a clean and fair playing
field. I get the point of it.

1655
01:37:48,390 --> 01:37:51,560
Uh, so we get the, the supplements tested,

1656
01:37:51,561 --> 01:37:55,110
they test the secondary batch, they
have all their information. It's like,

1657
01:37:55,111 --> 01:37:56,250
all right,
this would be

1658
01:37:56,250 --> 01:37:59,490
a fucking rock and roll.
And then they got real quiet.

1659
01:38:00,870 --> 01:38:05,850
Okay. Uh, now you're not talking
to us anymore. What do you mean?

1660
01:38:05,851 --> 01:38:09,150
Like you would contact him? They wouldn't
respond. They would take him a week,

1661
01:38:09,300 --> 01:38:13,170
two weeks. And what were they saying
when they do respond? Eh, you know, I,

1662
01:38:13,171 --> 01:38:16,770
I can't entirely remember myself.
It was my manager was in touch with them.

1663
01:38:16,771 --> 01:38:17,670
And what is the protocol?

1664
01:38:17,671 --> 01:38:21,390
If someone tests positive for something
that's a tainted supplement and it's a

1665
01:38:21,391 --> 01:38:25,410
third party supplement and where it's
not or it was not third party verified

1666
01:38:25,411 --> 01:38:25,951
rather well,

1667
01:38:25,951 --> 01:38:28,980
I don't even know if it was third party
verified that anything would be any

1668
01:38:28,981 --> 01:38:31,530
different. Hmm, okay.

1669
01:38:31,531 --> 01:38:35,640
Well if it is third party verified
and still is tainted, yeah,

1670
01:38:35,641 --> 01:38:39,110
that would be an issue, right? Yeah. If
you tested positive, he tested positive,

1671
01:38:39,150 --> 01:38:39,983
they found a supplement.

1672
01:38:40,260 --> 01:38:45,260
I think the idea about
third party verified is it's
much less likely to be a to

1673
01:38:46,920 --> 01:38:50,460
solve anything. And this is coming from
someone who's in the supplement business.

1674
01:38:50,790 --> 01:38:53,160
You know there's a certain amount
of this stuff you farm out.

1675
01:38:53,550 --> 01:38:56,850
So far as I know what the deal is,

1676
01:38:56,851 --> 01:39:00,780
there's a period of ineligibility sort of,
or basically what,

1677
01:39:00,900 --> 01:39:04,350
what happens is you're effectively
suspended until this thing is all finished

1678
01:39:04,351 --> 01:39:08,610
out and they tried to say that you're
not suspended, there's no suspension,

1679
01:39:08,611 --> 01:39:10,200
but that's not true.

1680
01:39:10,620 --> 01:39:13,170
But no one's going to book you for a
fight when treats you as you're suspended.

1681
01:39:13,171 --> 01:39:17,160
I tried to corner Travis Brown because
I was training him and they wouldn't let

1682
01:39:17,161 --> 01:39:20,730
me, they wouldn't let you
the corner. Yes. Okay.

1683
01:39:20,940 --> 01:39:25,200
And so then they're like, you're
suspended so you can't, you can't corner.

1684
01:39:25,440 --> 01:39:28,020
But you said you're not
suspending. Yeah, exactly. Okay.

1685
01:39:28,230 --> 01:39:32,070
So you're effectively suspended.
You can't work.

1686
01:39:32,100 --> 01:39:35,810
You can't even work as a
tertiary individual, as a,

1687
01:39:35,820 --> 01:39:38,310
as a corner man or anything like that.
He can't be at the event.

1688
01:39:38,580 --> 01:39:43,290
And this is after the fact where
you brought them to supplements.

1689
01:39:43,320 --> 01:39:47,490
They independently verified that
it was tainted. Yes. And uh,

1690
01:39:47,820 --> 01:39:52,020
so then we start talking and the,
throughout the process I said, look,

1691
01:39:52,350 --> 01:39:57,350
I'm not taking a punishment for
contamination and I'm not even fighting.

1692
01:39:57,391 --> 01:40:01,110
I'm not fighting anytime
soon. I'm not you. You can't,

1693
01:40:01,320 --> 01:40:04,080
like what you did with means and
these other people, you punish them,

1694
01:40:04,680 --> 01:40:08,070
you know that there was contamination,
but you punish them. Yeah.

1695
01:40:08,071 --> 01:40:11,000
They gave them many
months of, uh, you know,

1696
01:40:11,040 --> 01:40:14,610
suspension so that they're more able to
compete or make a living during those

1697
01:40:14,610 --> 01:40:16,770
months. And I'm like, no, I'm
not dealing, I'm not taking that.

1698
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:20,820
That's not acceptable because I'm not,
that's not what's going on here.

1699
01:40:21,060 --> 01:40:25,290
Nobody is doping. Nobody's trying
to cheat the system. There is no,

1700
01:40:25,440 --> 01:40:28,770
I'm not even fighting.
You don't get by punishing me.

1701
01:40:28,771 --> 01:40:30,270
You're trying to live guilt on me.

1702
01:40:30,570 --> 01:40:35,120
You're trying to make me out
to be some sort of, uh, uh,

1703
01:40:35,310 --> 01:40:36,143
you know,
uh,

1704
01:40:36,360 --> 01:40:40,700
guilty party as if I'm trying
to be a cheat of some soreness.

1705
01:40:40,740 --> 01:40:44,070
Like I'm not dealing, I'm not taking that.
So how did it ultimately get resolved?

1706
01:40:44,071 --> 01:40:48,060
Well, ultimately what ended up happening
is we had to go to arbitration.

1707
01:40:48,450 --> 01:40:48,931
That was all,

1708
01:40:48,931 --> 01:40:53,850
it was really left to us because then
they started trying to bring up, uh, uh,

1709
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:57,430
stuff from my past and then weigh that
against me as well. And it's like, Whoa,

1710
01:40:57,431 --> 01:40:58,810
dude,
you guys weren't even around.

1711
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:02,880
And now you get to decide
to add to the weight of,

1712
01:41:02,881 --> 01:41:06,420
of whatever punishment you want
to levy against me based on, uh,

1713
01:41:06,910 --> 01:41:11,140
things that didn't involve you. Great.
That's two. What were they talking about?

1714
01:41:11,141 --> 01:41:15,760
They're talking about 2001.
No, 2008. They went to 2008.

1715
01:41:15,870 --> 01:41:19,360
Yeah. They tried and they tried to
say, well, oh yeah, well this happened.

1716
01:41:19,361 --> 01:41:22,660
So then therefore, you know, now
they start talking about two years.

1717
01:41:22,950 --> 01:41:25,480
[inaudible] thank you.
And you gotta be fucking kidding me.

1718
01:41:25,540 --> 01:41:28,360
They started talking about suspending you
for two years for a tainted supplement.

1719
01:41:28,370 --> 01:41:32,590
Yes. Wow. And I'm just going, there's no
way I wouldn't even accept six months.

1720
01:41:32,591 --> 01:41:33,880
You think I'm going to take two years.

1721
01:41:33,940 --> 01:41:37,300
And so we go and we inquire
on the Arbor and I've done,

1722
01:41:37,330 --> 01:41:40,870
I did an interview with the guy that
we were dealing with through Skype. Uh,

1723
01:41:40,910 --> 01:41:42,160
we've,
we've been in touch.

1724
01:41:42,161 --> 01:41:45,070
It just like at some point
everything turned and changed.

1725
01:41:45,280 --> 01:41:49,030
Their tone changed there.
Even the original penalties,

1726
01:41:49,031 --> 01:41:52,840
they were looking to levy
increased new shit gets brought in.

1727
01:41:53,050 --> 01:41:57,580
It's like they became a completely
different animal. As soon as you know,

1728
01:41:57,790 --> 01:42:02,790
there was the evidence of contamination
and that I wasn't gonna I wasn't willing

1729
01:42:04,361 --> 01:42:06,740
to take the punishment for it.
It wasn't.

1730
01:42:07,390 --> 01:42:10,360
What do you think their motivation
is here? I don't think that they,

1731
01:42:10,480 --> 01:42:13,650
and this is just my opinion, I think
the way you saw it, it looks at it and,

1732
01:42:13,680 --> 01:42:16,930
and it's an easy way to go about it
is that the more people they ding,

1733
01:42:16,931 --> 01:42:19,660
the more effective they appear.
It's their effect.

1734
01:42:19,690 --> 01:42:23,710
Their efficacy is based on punished on
punishments, doled out, not necessarily,

1735
01:42:23,740 --> 01:42:27,760
not on lack of punishments at all.
So do you think this is, you know,

1736
01:42:27,790 --> 01:42:28,790
also remember they get,

1737
01:42:29,080 --> 01:42:31,300
they get you to mention by the
people that are working there,

1738
01:42:31,450 --> 01:42:34,420
so they arbitrarily get to
decide how things go about right.

1739
01:42:34,420 --> 01:42:38,080
There's not like a very strict
protocol that they must follow.

1740
01:42:38,081 --> 01:42:40,370
They're tainted supplements are for this?
No,

1741
01:42:40,400 --> 01:42:43,630
there is actually quite a
bit of a lever or there,

1742
01:42:43,800 --> 01:42:47,260
there is leeway in terms of how they
can enforce and what they can enforce.

1743
01:42:47,261 --> 01:42:51,910
So when it's subjective, it's up, there
is subjectivity in it. Um, they, uh,

1744
01:42:51,970 --> 01:42:56,770
they have a lot of discretion. There
is some outlined elements of protocol,

1745
01:42:56,771 --> 01:43:01,690
but there is no, it is always this
or it is always that. Right. And, uh,

1746
01:43:01,900 --> 01:43:02,260
you know,

1747
01:43:02,260 --> 01:43:06,190
I didn't begrudge them for a period of
ineligibility while you're going through

1748
01:43:06,191 --> 01:43:10,090
the process of finding out whether this
is contamination or what have you doing

1749
01:43:10,091 --> 01:43:12,910
any testing. And that makes
sense to me. That's fine.

1750
01:43:13,030 --> 01:43:17,020
I understand that if this guy
supposedly has something in a system,

1751
01:43:17,080 --> 01:43:20,860
well let's figure out what it is
and once we have a better idea,

1752
01:43:20,861 --> 01:43:23,830
then we can decide about whether you can
go back into the pool or do this or do

1753
01:43:23,831 --> 01:43:27,250
that or if you're going to leverage
any punishments. Makes sense to me.

1754
01:43:27,910 --> 01:43:31,750
But in addition to that, then tacking
on more shit in terms of my case,

1755
01:43:31,760 --> 01:43:35,560
I was like, that's not
acceptable. So we, we go,

1756
01:43:35,561 --> 01:43:38,590
well I guess the only thing left
to us is to go to arbitration.

1757
01:43:38,950 --> 01:43:41,860
And so my manager spoke with,
um,

1758
01:43:42,720 --> 01:43:46,690
when I was working through them to
arbitration and we said, okay, well we'll,

1759
01:43:46,990 --> 01:43:48,010
what is that going to take?

1760
01:43:48,011 --> 01:43:51,320
Well that's going to cost more money
out of my pocket. Um, you know,

1761
01:43:51,321 --> 01:43:56,321
the arbitration process is these are guys
that they're paid by Usada to do their

1762
01:43:56,781 --> 01:43:59,390
arbitration. Like they worked
for them in a way or they're not,

1763
01:43:59,391 --> 01:44:01,460
they don't work under them directly,
but they are,

1764
01:44:01,580 --> 01:44:06,580
they do get paid to be a arbitrary to
somehow there's some get contracted by

1765
01:44:08,080 --> 01:44:11,000
Usada. Yes. And uh, and
so that was like, ah,

1766
01:44:11,001 --> 01:44:13,100
I don't necessarily feel the
most comfortable with that,

1767
01:44:13,101 --> 01:44:15,410
but I can also understand how it's not,

1768
01:44:15,800 --> 01:44:18,800
there's probably not an easier way
to go about it, but, okay. I got it.

1769
01:44:20,210 --> 01:44:21,980
Then when we,
uh,

1770
01:44:22,220 --> 01:44:26,000
then we get notice back from Usada
that we have to limit the scope of our

1771
01:44:26,001 --> 01:44:29,840
argument. We're like,
Whoa, Whoa, what you,

1772
01:44:29,841 --> 01:44:32,720
you're going to tell us what we
can and can't argue in arbitration.

1773
01:44:34,460 --> 01:44:39,110
I don't remember what the definitions
were exactly, but it was like, you can't,

1774
01:44:39,370 --> 01:44:43,460
you know, you have to keep it within
this boundary and this realm and this.

1775
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:44,390
And I'm like,
well,

1776
01:44:44,391 --> 01:44:49,340
you can't fucking try to say the levy
this against me and then you stuff from my

1777
01:44:49,341 --> 01:44:51,500
past and then tell me I
can't argue my full case.

1778
01:44:51,560 --> 01:44:54,370
So the eliminating the amount that you
could defend yourself as every site,

1779
01:44:55,370 --> 01:44:58,850
they were limiting the,
um, the range of argument,

1780
01:44:58,851 --> 01:45:01,310
you could make the argument
be that you would bring up,

1781
01:45:01,311 --> 01:45:05,210
that they would want to limit?
Uh, that's a good question.

1782
01:45:05,240 --> 01:45:07,430
I don't know exactly.
Did they define that?

1783
01:45:07,460 --> 01:45:10,310
They know they had definitions
in the emails with,

1784
01:45:10,340 --> 01:45:14,750
with back and forth from my manager.
And he goes, well fuck we, you know,

1785
01:45:14,751 --> 01:45:19,530
cause we could argue about, um, you
know, this is contamination. Um, and,

1786
01:45:19,630 --> 01:45:23,720
and go from there. But if it's
something really potentially limiting,

1787
01:45:23,750 --> 01:45:26,750
which was weird about how they pled it,
you just don't remember what exactly,

1788
01:45:26,751 --> 01:45:29,690
I don't remember all the details. It's
very detail oriented. It's legal ease.

1789
01:45:30,020 --> 01:45:34,490
And uh, and then so we get to
the point, it's like, well fuck,

1790
01:45:34,520 --> 01:45:38,330
well this doesn't even look like a very,
you know,

1791
01:45:38,450 --> 01:45:42,740
this might not even be a useful way
of trying to approach this thing.

1792
01:45:43,340 --> 01:45:46,040
And it got down to the wire to where,

1793
01:45:46,041 --> 01:45:50,330
and we kept pushing it back and pushing
it back and, and saying like, you know,

1794
01:45:50,331 --> 01:45:53,870
we can we get an extension and to try
and figure out how the hell did we

1795
01:45:53,871 --> 01:45:56,870
approach this? And, and also like how,

1796
01:45:56,930 --> 01:46:00,200
how could we approach without having
to spend money on having lawyers get

1797
01:46:00,201 --> 01:46:00,711
involved.

1798
01:46:00,711 --> 01:46:03,770
I mean that's the last thing you want
to do is get to litigation or you know,

1799
01:46:03,771 --> 01:46:07,540
even arbitration and it's a legal
process. It's complex and it is, it's,

1800
01:46:07,700 --> 01:46:11,300
there's a lot of uh, and lawyers
love billable hours or they do.

1801
01:46:11,570 --> 01:46:15,110
And so it gets down to
the wire essentially.

1802
01:46:15,170 --> 01:46:18,950
And we,
I just sit back and I go,

1803
01:46:19,820 --> 01:46:22,370
I won't accept any ruling
if it's a punishment at all.

1804
01:46:22,371 --> 01:46:25,580
I don't care what they say. I'll
just be like, Nah, not I, I don't,

1805
01:46:25,610 --> 01:46:28,520
I'm not going to abide by it.
You can't force me to do shit.

1806
01:46:28,700 --> 01:46:29,960
And I guess we'll have to cross

1807
01:46:30,500 --> 01:46:35,500
position is that if you are accidentally
taking a tainted supplement and also

1808
01:46:36,171 --> 01:46:40,070
trace amounts that have absolutely
zero effect on performance,

1809
01:46:40,520 --> 01:46:44,510
there's nothing that you're doing by
accidentally taking that that in any way

1810
01:46:44,520 --> 01:46:47,180
would help you and that's a
fact. That's a proven fact. Yes.

1811
01:46:47,330 --> 01:46:49,710
So your position is you
shouldn't be punished. Correct.

1812
01:46:50,340 --> 01:46:54,900
Then you're out of the year once you,
the time that you've been out.

1813
01:46:55,390 --> 01:46:59,880
Here's the thing, that's enough. Exactly.
It's one thing you don't need to say,

1814
01:47:00,210 --> 01:47:05,150
oh well if you, if it took six, if it
took a seven months to get the, the,

1815
01:47:05,160 --> 01:47:08,700
the information that you needed the
data, right to then clarify, okay,

1816
01:47:08,701 --> 01:47:12,660
well you're not at fault to then say,
oh well we'll suspend you for six months.

1817
01:47:12,661 --> 01:47:14,220
But since that six months is already past,

1818
01:47:14,221 --> 01:47:16,830
it's like we didn't suspend
you at all. No. Motherfucker,

1819
01:47:17,010 --> 01:47:20,370
when you look in the end
of the hunt at the data,

1820
01:47:20,371 --> 01:47:24,270
when you go and look at this case, it says
suspended, which means you punished me,

1821
01:47:24,271 --> 01:47:26,460
which means I was guilty in some way.

1822
01:47:26,580 --> 01:47:31,140
You said I'm guilty because that's how
you got to punish me, right. It's not,

1823
01:47:31,141 --> 01:47:33,180
it's under investigation or you know,

1824
01:47:33,270 --> 01:47:38,150
after investigation exonerated
after invest. No, it's just,

1825
01:47:38,190 --> 01:47:40,440
no, you still levied a
punishment in there to say that,

1826
01:47:40,441 --> 01:47:43,140
look how we caught this guy and we
punished them and I'm like, I'm not,

1827
01:47:43,260 --> 01:47:47,220
I'm not gonna, I'm not down
for that. And so oddly enough,

1828
01:47:47,940 --> 01:47:51,750
so I was like on aerials or something
like that and I said, I, I won't accept,

1829
01:47:52,020 --> 01:47:55,050
I don't care what they say. I don't
care what punishment they tried to levy.

1830
01:47:55,051 --> 01:47:58,200
I don't abide by it. I won't agree
to it. And I'm done with them.

1831
01:47:59,220 --> 01:48:02,190
And someone from the arbitrary,

1832
01:48:02,220 --> 01:48:04,680
the arbitrators office
who we were dealing with,

1833
01:48:04,681 --> 01:48:09,510
calls us out of the blue and goes, so
you still sure you don't want to do this?

1834
01:48:09,590 --> 01:48:11,430
I'm like, well, and my manager goes, well,

1835
01:48:11,431 --> 01:48:16,200
they said that we have to limit the
scope of argument to this and this and we

1836
01:48:16,201 --> 01:48:19,560
can't talk. And then he goes, no, you
don't. You can talk about, you can,

1837
01:48:19,561 --> 01:48:22,380
you can bring any argument you want.
Who is saying this to you?

1838
01:48:22,440 --> 01:48:25,440
The arbitrators office and

1839
01:48:25,450 --> 01:48:28,810
this. So who would initially come to
you and said the had elite? The scope,

1840
01:48:28,840 --> 01:48:31,710
your argument. You sorta,
okay, so you saw it.

1841
01:48:31,711 --> 01:48:35,380
It was attempting to establish
some boundaries for your arguments.

1842
01:48:35,560 --> 01:48:40,560
But the people who are the actual
arbitrators said that that's not true.

1843
01:48:40,640 --> 01:48:42,790
Right? They, that's not the
case. You don't have, it doesn't,

1844
01:48:42,860 --> 01:48:45,200
they can't force you
to argue in a certain,

1845
01:48:45,320 --> 01:48:49,610
oh, okay. So is it possible that you
sought as lawyers? We're trying to,

1846
01:48:49,760 --> 01:48:52,460
here's the thing I've found
about, about lawyers, like yeah,

1847
01:48:52,461 --> 01:48:55,700
for sure they're necessary and that's
all well and good and you need them.

1848
01:48:55,940 --> 01:48:57,560
But there's a reality,

1849
01:48:57,561 --> 01:49:00,350
and this is something that I had to deal
with recently in doing something with a

1850
01:49:00,351 --> 01:49:05,351
friend through lawyers where they
attached a bunch of shit to this deal that

1851
01:49:05,601 --> 01:49:07,970
wasn't supposed to be in there and
he didn't even know it was in there.

1852
01:49:08,270 --> 01:49:11,660
And then my lawyer is like, what the
fuck is this? And so I contact him,

1853
01:49:11,661 --> 01:49:14,090
what the fuck is this? And he's
like, what the fuck is that?

1854
01:49:14,210 --> 01:49:16,280
So he contacts his lawyers,
what the fuck is this?

1855
01:49:16,490 --> 01:49:21,350
And it turns out this is a common thing.
Lawyers they do with each other.

1856
01:49:21,351 --> 01:49:24,890
Yeah.
We put this in to give you leverage.

1857
01:49:25,040 --> 01:49:27,350
I don't think you necessarily want that,

1858
01:49:27,410 --> 01:49:29,390
but we're looking out
for your best interests.

1859
01:49:29,630 --> 01:49:32,360
And so now you have a
good negotiation point.

1860
01:49:32,480 --> 01:49:35,120
If you just go in with what you want,

1861
01:49:35,420 --> 01:49:37,430
then they're going to
ask for more than that.

1862
01:49:37,431 --> 01:49:40,550
And then you're not in a strong position
because you can't ask for more after

1863
01:49:40,551 --> 01:49:42,170
you've already established your
initial position. Right. Makes

1864
01:49:42,170 --> 01:49:47,140
everything convoluted there grows by,
but that's the world we live in.

1865
01:49:47,141 --> 01:49:50,530
Your grandfather was a Tejas world.
Pretty Pretty Fair lawyer.

1866
01:49:50,531 --> 01:49:52,960
He was assistant attorney general,
the state of Washington.

1867
01:49:53,140 --> 01:49:56,530
He actually wanted me to get into
law of all things, but I'm like, Eh,

1868
01:49:56,670 --> 01:50:00,010
I think I'll, or the beat out
my brains yet. Seems like, well,

1869
01:50:00,011 --> 01:50:04,660
you haven't beaten them out.
Very impressive with your
memory. So we, uh, we get to,

1870
01:50:05,590 --> 01:50:07,330
my manager comes back
to me. He goes, hey man,

1871
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:10,400
they just contacted me out of
nowhere. And they're like, well,

1872
01:50:10,420 --> 01:50:14,050
if you want to do this, you can. And No,
you can't, you, you can make the argument.

1873
01:50:14,080 --> 01:50:18,190
There's no limiting in the scope of your
argument or anything. So then it's like,

1874
01:50:18,220 --> 01:50:23,020
well, yeah, all right, I'll go for
it because he wants our least. Yeah.

1875
01:50:23,021 --> 01:50:23,801
Cause at the very least,

1876
01:50:23,801 --> 01:50:26,690
I thought maybe I could have some
sort of record down of, of what,

1877
01:50:26,691 --> 01:50:30,790
what we talked about, what was discussed,
the arguments made. So in the end,

1878
01:50:30,791 --> 01:50:34,390
you know, no matter what, how it came
out, I can go here, here's what's legit,

1879
01:50:34,460 --> 01:50:38,470
then you can, you can make your own
decision from there. And so we go in, uh,

1880
01:50:38,471 --> 01:50:41,320
I brought my legal team.
They, he, they had a,

1881
01:50:41,321 --> 01:50:44,470
their lawyer come who was the same guy
we were dealing with throughout the

1882
01:50:44,471 --> 01:50:48,610
entire process and they made
their argument and we made ours.

1883
01:50:48,611 --> 01:50:52,620
And you know, and there, there are times
where I'm sitting back and I go, you know,

1884
01:50:52,840 --> 01:50:56,230
making, they're making closing
arguments that each lawyers,

1885
01:50:56,860 --> 01:50:59,560
and I'm just sitting there listening
to the Usada Seigel oh man,

1886
01:50:59,561 --> 01:51:04,300
he's just pushing them. He's just
moving the goalposts. He's, uh, how so?

1887
01:51:04,380 --> 01:51:08,130
Well, it's just taking a certain
element and then trying to, you know,

1888
01:51:08,200 --> 01:51:10,840
you slippery slope arguments and
moving the goalpost on things.

1889
01:51:10,841 --> 01:51:15,520
But he's just doing anything he can to
use rhetoric instead of logos at this

1890
01:51:15,521 --> 01:51:16,540
point because you know,

1891
01:51:16,590 --> 01:51:19,360
they're lawyers and they're trying
to make their case and trying to find

1892
01:51:19,361 --> 01:51:24,130
impassioned responses, you know,
consider the people listening at home.

1893
01:51:24,430 --> 01:51:26,950
Don't really know your case,
don't know the scope. Okay.

1894
01:51:26,951 --> 01:51:29,860
So it's like trying to
say that, uh, you know,

1895
01:51:29,861 --> 01:51:33,640
find ways at which to move
the goalposts in terms of,

1896
01:51:33,641 --> 01:51:36,130
so what,
like I said to you earlier,

1897
01:51:36,131 --> 01:51:40,390
I keep batches of all the supplements
that I take and especially when I'm in

1898
01:51:40,391 --> 01:51:43,290
these, this program, and
especially after dealing with the,

1899
01:51:43,291 --> 01:51:46,420
the cluster fuck that was
California and it's like, well,

1900
01:51:46,421 --> 01:51:50,810
I didn't have anything that I could
bring to you that I could fuck, you know,

1901
01:51:50,811 --> 01:51:54,430
so I'm like, this is never happening
again. So I keep everything.

1902
01:51:54,431 --> 01:51:58,750
They go and they test stuff and
they find it and I kept notes.

1903
01:51:58,751 --> 01:52:01,570
I kept this and it's like,

1904
01:52:01,780 --> 01:52:04,760
what more could I have done for you guys?
Even if it,

1905
01:52:04,761 --> 01:52:05,920
it doesn't matter if there's,

1906
01:52:05,950 --> 01:52:07,960
let's say what they were all
third party tested as well.

1907
01:52:07,961 --> 01:52:11,740
I would still keep batches of the
supplements in any of this stuff.

1908
01:52:11,740 --> 01:52:15,220
I take third party test. What was the
issue then? Well, it's just simply,

1909
01:52:15,221 --> 01:52:19,140
it's just they kept trying to say that
I didn't do a good enough job that, uh,

1910
01:52:19,360 --> 01:52:22,560
did you use the, uh, did you see this uh,

1911
01:52:22,690 --> 01:52:24,790
thing on supplement form one?
One?

1912
01:52:24,791 --> 01:52:29,380
It's like that came out after the fact
and yes, I have seen that. I'm fact,

1913
01:52:29,381 --> 01:52:32,710
I use all the resources that
you provided your global dro,

1914
01:52:32,711 --> 01:52:37,420
your other supplement form one, one,
two check against ingredient lists,

1915
01:52:37,510 --> 01:52:38,470
supplement names,

1916
01:52:38,530 --> 01:52:42,490
company names to make sure none of this
shit is on the list so that I don't make

1917
01:52:42,491 --> 01:52:45,040
that mistake.
So I use the resources that you give me.

1918
01:52:45,290 --> 01:52:48,920
I keep batches of my supplements
so they can be tested if need be.

1919
01:52:49,190 --> 01:52:52,250
I do what's available
to keep from any issues.

1920
01:52:52,670 --> 01:52:56,900
And yet they just kept moving the goalpost
on that and trying to say that, well,

1921
01:52:56,901 --> 01:52:59,900
but you didn't, uh, you didn't
hire a psychic. You know,

1922
01:52:59,930 --> 01:53:02,000
it's just that kind of shit.
And I'm like, well how,

1923
01:53:02,540 --> 01:53:05,870
how could this have been any better?
And not to mention I'm not fighting.

1924
01:53:06,820 --> 01:53:11,020
Right. So at the end of the day, what
were they looking for in arbitration?

1925
01:53:11,280 --> 01:53:11,940
Uh,

1926
01:53:11,940 --> 01:53:16,940
they wanted to levy a punishment
against me and suspend me for years.

1927
01:53:17,580 --> 01:53:20,220
And this is Usada. Yes.
So you saw to ultimately,

1928
01:53:20,221 --> 01:53:24,450
even though they knew that you took a
tainted supplement that had no effect

1929
01:53:24,451 --> 01:53:25,880
whatsoever on your performance,
right.

1930
01:53:26,040 --> 01:53:29,640
They still wanted to punish you
for two years. That seems stupid.

1931
01:53:30,180 --> 01:53:32,280
That just seems stupid. Now, let me,

1932
01:53:32,400 --> 01:53:36,030
let me read Jeff Novitsky because Novitsky
texted me because I told him this was

1933
01:53:36,031 --> 01:53:39,720
going to go down and his take is
a little bit different than yours.

1934
01:53:39,780 --> 01:53:42,880
I don't imagine. It isn't. All right.
I'm, I'm not surprised that it is.

1935
01:53:43,130 --> 01:53:46,630
And I, uh, I told you what
it was, um, the, so this is,

1936
01:53:47,030 --> 01:53:48,680
I'll just read you what it says.
Uh,

1937
01:53:48,740 --> 01:53:52,830
he'd said he'll complain about the
amount of time that went by with Usada

1938
01:53:52,880 --> 01:53:53,451
process,

1939
01:53:53,451 --> 01:53:57,590
but he notified us of retirement right
after the positive sample was collected

1940
01:53:57,920 --> 01:53:59,750
before a positive was announced.

1941
01:53:59,751 --> 01:54:04,751
So he was off in the wind for many
months and not communicating with Usada.

1942
01:54:05,720 --> 01:54:10,370
A big reason the case took so long to
resolve to his positive was from a tainted

1943
01:54:10,371 --> 01:54:12,530
supplement,
but he didn't do the number one thing.

1944
01:54:12,531 --> 01:54:16,580
We advised the UFC athletes on
UFC athletes on supplements.

1945
01:54:16,910 --> 01:54:20,720
He didn't choose a supplement that
was third party certified, uh,

1946
01:54:20,840 --> 01:54:24,530
as a banned substance free.
Like on it, supplements are,

1947
01:54:25,040 --> 01:54:28,400
there are literally hundreds of certified
supplements out there and virtually

1948
01:54:29,720 --> 01:54:34,460
and virtually ensures no issues to a
foreign athlete if they stick with those.

1949
01:54:35,280 --> 01:54:37,130
Uh,
one other point for Barnett,

1950
01:54:37,430 --> 01:54:41,540
when he was unresponsive to case he
missed all of his deadlines to file for

1951
01:54:41,541 --> 01:54:43,170
arbitration.
Uh,

1952
01:54:43,190 --> 01:54:46,580
he came to the table later and said
he wanted to go to arbitration.

1953
01:54:46,581 --> 01:54:48,980
You saw automate and
exclusion and let him,

1954
01:54:48,981 --> 01:54:52,700
which ultimately led to his
favorable ruling by arbitrator.

1955
01:54:52,970 --> 01:54:57,530
Their reasoning was that they wanted
to rule in favor of fairness to athlete

1956
01:54:57,890 --> 01:55:02,450
rules. Say they didn't have to after
time, uh, to file expired. Well,

1957
01:55:02,480 --> 01:55:06,800
but they're saying you it ruled favorably
towards you ultimately at the end of

1958
01:55:06,800 --> 01:55:06,880
the day.

1959
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:08,410
Yes.
They like all those in our favor.

1960
01:55:08,411 --> 01:55:13,000
Gobbly goop does that the other
probably shit. He says that, oh,

1961
01:55:13,001 --> 01:55:16,780
well he retired and he was in the wind.
You know what my in the wind was?

1962
01:55:16,781 --> 01:55:20,440
It wasn't even that long.
I was in Japan for rising with my athlete,

1963
01:55:20,441 --> 01:55:23,500
Alyssa Garcia. Mm. It wasn't in the
fucking wind. Sounds good though.

1964
01:55:23,550 --> 01:55:24,690
You're in the wind and the wind

1965
01:55:25,090 --> 01:55:29,590
fucking you. And that motorcycle
jacket just drives him. Yeah.

1966
01:55:29,600 --> 01:55:30,970
I'm dragging from behind me.

1967
01:55:30,971 --> 01:55:35,860
Like Django through the Nevada desert.
Somebody pulls you over,

1968
01:55:35,861 --> 01:55:37,270
got eight days growth on your face.

1969
01:55:37,310 --> 01:55:41,340
You Charge Barnett some days where you
Sada we're, we're looking for your broken.

1970
01:55:41,341 --> 01:55:44,050
I, he pissed this cup for me. I've

1971
01:55:44,090 --> 01:55:48,420
been breakup. Just, yeah, I was in Japan
at rising, you know, I wasn't in the wind.

1972
01:55:48,600 --> 01:55:51,540
And uh, they, so it takes in your favor.

1973
01:55:51,810 --> 01:55:55,740
They arbitrator arbitrator. And what
did they say? This is the same guy.

1974
01:55:55,910 --> 01:56:00,030
The arbitrator is the same guy that
put together is he's an ICARUS.

1975
01:56:00,031 --> 01:56:04,710
He produced ICARUS, the
movie on, on doping. He is,

1976
01:56:04,740 --> 01:56:08,880
he's one of the major figures in
terms of the world of anti-doping.

1977
01:56:09,060 --> 01:56:13,860
So it's one of the guys who worked
with Bryan Fogel. Uh, the arbitrator,

1978
01:56:14,310 --> 01:56:17,400
Bryan Fogel was the guys
who started in Icarus.

1979
01:56:17,490 --> 01:56:20,370
This guy is a arbitrator or water,

1980
01:56:22,920 --> 01:56:25,690
actually, why am I doing this? Either
way. You look, Jamie, Jamie can handles,

1981
01:56:26,300 --> 01:56:30,300
but it doesn't matter. This guy has the
end of the day. Everything in terms of,

1982
01:56:30,301 --> 01:56:33,780
of drug testing in your favor.
Yes. And he said he does it.

1983
01:56:33,781 --> 01:56:37,710
He couldn't see any way that I could
have done hardly a better job than I was

1984
01:56:37,711 --> 01:56:40,740
meticulous with my record keeping that uh,
I may,

1985
01:56:40,741 --> 01:56:45,741
I did essentially everything I could
in the means of a normal person to do.

1986
01:56:45,900 --> 01:56:50,520
How was it resolved at the end?
It was a, the last of reprimand.

1987
01:56:50,550 --> 01:56:53,430
That's it. Reprimand? Yeah.
What does that, what do they do?

1988
01:56:54,150 --> 01:56:59,130
Richard h average. And Mclaren. Mclaren.
Yeah. Oh, see, chief arbitrator. Yes.

1989
01:57:00,180 --> 01:57:04,530
Okay. So at the end of
the day, after all this,

1990
01:57:04,560 --> 01:57:06,690
they say they give you a reprimand.
What does that mean?

1991
01:57:06,780 --> 01:57:10,530
That just means like don't do
that. Be careful. Yeah. Okay.

1992
01:57:11,030 --> 01:57:14,490
[inaudible] and this took no punishment.
Right?

1993
01:57:14,620 --> 01:57:19,560
And to your shit from Usada was on
unwarranted right and heavy handed,

1994
01:57:19,590 --> 01:57:22,970
heavy handed as hell. And, and junior
dos Santos went through that too. Right.

1995
01:57:22,980 --> 01:57:27,450
Started at at six months.
And then by the time we,

1996
01:57:27,451 --> 01:57:30,450
they have both supplements tested,

1997
01:57:31,710 --> 01:57:34,350
then all of a sudden it starts
getting weird. And you know,

1998
01:57:34,351 --> 01:57:39,120
this claim by new whiskey that we were
out of, no, we were always in touch.

1999
01:57:39,150 --> 01:57:40,840
Novitsky doesn't work for you saw it.

2000
01:57:40,870 --> 01:57:45,870
And I know this is what's kind kinda
funny is new whiskey is such a public face

2001
01:57:46,141 --> 01:57:50,010
on this kind of thing. But when it
comes to actually dealing with Usada,

2002
01:57:50,790 --> 01:57:53,550
he's all, he's hands up. I
mean he'll come and he'll,

2003
01:57:53,551 --> 01:57:56,850
he'll make sure to put something
out there in any of the sphere.

2004
01:57:57,150 --> 01:57:59,870
But in reality he ain't got a
fucking thing to do with any of them.

2005
01:58:00,050 --> 01:58:00,811
But in his defense,

2006
01:58:00,811 --> 01:58:05,130
he's a UFC employee and it's inappropriate
for him to have any influence

2007
01:58:05,131 --> 01:58:08,460
whatsoever on the way they rule things
that, but that's, that is that is that,

2008
01:58:08,610 --> 01:58:11,550
I think that's actually the proper
thing for him to do a in a way.

2009
01:58:11,551 --> 01:58:14,310
But I mean it's just,
it's a, it's a, it's it,

2010
01:58:14,520 --> 01:58:17,130
the presentation is a bit of a misnomer.
I think so.

2011
01:58:17,160 --> 01:58:21,900
Well initially he was responsible for
the drug testing. Now he's, what is he,

2012
01:58:21,901 --> 01:58:25,640
the president of athletes safety
and wellness talk pop thing.

2013
01:58:25,720 --> 01:58:28,510
They're running the performance
institute. Yeah. I mean what they're,

2014
01:58:28,660 --> 01:58:32,550
what they're concentrating on now I'm
just saying it for Jeff and his sheriff

2015
01:58:32,760 --> 01:58:37,760
that I think they're concentrating more
on encouraging fighters to train and,

2016
01:58:37,941 --> 01:58:42,370
and, and fortify their body with nutrition
correctly and giving them education

2017
01:58:42,370 --> 01:58:45,070
on how to do this and that Jeff is at
the forefront of that stuff and showing

2018
01:58:45,071 --> 01:58:50,071
them how to avoid accidentally taking
something and definitely had a little boy

2019
01:58:50,480 --> 01:58:54,830
coming with this is that he is not fully
in the loop with what happened between

2020
01:58:54,831 --> 01:58:57,430
me and Usada cause he's not involved.
Right.

2021
01:58:57,770 --> 01:59:02,090
So some of some of what he's saying
there is incorrect and it's not,

2022
01:59:02,120 --> 01:59:04,830
I don't blame him because
he's not a part of it.

2023
01:59:04,930 --> 01:59:09,350
So is he misinformed?
I at the very least that they,

2024
01:59:09,390 --> 01:59:10,800
they're not being
straight forward with it.

2025
01:59:10,801 --> 01:59:13,120
It sounds to me like they
wanted to punish you badly.

2026
01:59:13,121 --> 01:59:16,690
They wanted to punish me badly. Yeah.
Two years is a fucking crazy punishment.

2027
01:59:16,691 --> 01:59:18,410
And also when,

2028
01:59:18,480 --> 01:59:23,480
when people get you to remember
when I'm Nick Diaz was uh,

2029
01:59:24,940 --> 01:59:29,620
was being interviewed by all these people
and then there was that mean lady who

2030
01:59:29,621 --> 01:59:33,190
works in Nevada at a commission and
she was grilling him and I'm like,

2031
01:59:33,640 --> 01:59:36,280
you were talking about pot here.
You crazy lady.

2032
01:59:36,281 --> 01:59:39,490
Like what in the fuck are you doing?
You're acting like you've robbed a bank.

2033
01:59:39,960 --> 01:59:42,880
Even not if he's not getting in the
ring. Hi. And leave him alone. Exactly.

2034
01:59:42,881 --> 01:59:45,940
And I think he probably did a few
times, I think. I mean, it wasn't there.

2035
01:59:47,140 --> 01:59:50,860
I think in the Gombe fighting, he might've
been, hi, I'm bleeding. Oh my God,

2036
01:59:51,040 --> 01:59:53,830
maybe I should choke him right now.
He didn't give a shit fight.

2037
01:59:55,270 --> 01:59:58,420
Jon Jones is going through this right now.
I don't know where John Jones stands,

2038
01:59:58,421 --> 02:00:02,990
but it's been pretty well established
that at the very least what the,

2039
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:07,870
the numbers, if you look at the numbers
when he was tested. Um, and you know,

2040
02:00:07,871 --> 02:00:10,330
I don't, I know a lot of people
like to say that he's a cheater.

2041
02:00:10,360 --> 02:00:14,140
This is a lot of this going on right now.
Look real clear.

2042
02:00:14,290 --> 02:00:18,670
The first test was proven that
he took tainted Dick Pills.

2043
02:00:18,910 --> 02:00:19,743
Okay.
Yeah.

2044
02:00:20,070 --> 02:00:21,810
Well it was a actually,

2045
02:00:21,811 --> 02:00:25,350
so that got brought up to my attention
as part of all this because you know,

2046
02:00:25,380 --> 02:00:29,850
you saw it, a felon that relevant.
The difference between that first one,

2047
02:00:29,880 --> 02:00:32,630
let's say, and I'm not, I don't know
about the second shift with John.

2048
02:00:32,670 --> 02:00:33,840
I don't really follow close on this,

2049
02:00:33,841 --> 02:00:36,750
but this came across my
plate because he had,

2050
02:00:36,751 --> 02:00:41,751
he was taking like a liquid Cialis and
it was from a company that sells sarms

2051
02:00:44,160 --> 02:00:46,250
and peptides and all that shit.

2052
02:00:46,251 --> 02:00:49,920
So it was a company that also
sells banned substances. Right.

2053
02:00:50,250 --> 02:00:52,410
And so their argument was that dude,

2054
02:00:52,440 --> 02:00:56,010
you're buying or using shit from a place
full of illegal shit that you're not

2055
02:00:56,011 --> 02:00:56,810
supposed to take.

2056
02:00:56,810 --> 02:00:57,830
Definitely a dumb move.

2057
02:00:58,160 --> 02:01:02,990
Does it mean God damn
prescription for Cialis?

2058
02:01:03,230 --> 02:01:06,920
Right? You don't need to take
this funky shit. I imagined, um,

2059
02:01:07,790 --> 02:01:09,050
the second one,

2060
02:01:09,350 --> 02:01:14,350
what he took had such a minuscule
trace amount that he tested negative.

2061
02:01:15,050 --> 02:01:17,660
Denny tested positive,
then he tested negative again.

2062
02:01:17,661 --> 02:01:19,940
And this is something that's supposed
to stay in your system for months.

2063
02:01:20,300 --> 02:01:23,600
So this is indicative of someone
who's not taking something to get into

2064
02:01:23,601 --> 02:01:25,550
performance enhancing and benefit from it.

2065
02:01:25,700 --> 02:01:28,960
But rather someone who had something
that was tainted. And these lab techs,

2066
02:01:28,961 --> 02:01:29,380
technicians

2067
02:01:29,380 --> 02:01:30,970
are smart on this shit.

2068
02:01:30,971 --> 02:01:34,620
Like the guy who saw the results from the,

2069
02:01:34,710 --> 02:01:37,380
the first little batch of
supplements we gave him, he,

2070
02:01:37,390 --> 02:01:40,040
he had seen everything and then some under

2071
02:01:40,040 --> 02:01:43,550
the sun and all different
levels and this guy knew what,

2072
02:01:43,580 --> 02:01:47,270
what constituted contamination and
what wasn't. He could tell, right?

2073
02:01:47,300 --> 02:01:49,370
Of course they can tell
just by the numbers. Look,

2074
02:01:49,371 --> 02:01:51,560
if you're taking trace
amounts of anything,

2075
02:01:51,830 --> 02:01:55,220
it's not going to do a damn thing to your
body in terms of performance enhancing,

2076
02:01:55,221 --> 02:01:58,010
but it is going to show up in these
tests because he's tests are incredibly

2077
02:01:58,011 --> 02:02:00,200
thorough. Hey Jamie, Google,

2078
02:02:00,201 --> 02:02:03,800
what's going on with Jon Jones case
because particularly after this weekend,

2079
02:02:03,830 --> 02:02:06,290
it's very, very relevant. You know,

2080
02:02:06,291 --> 02:02:11,120
I mean with Brock Lesnar getting in there
with DC just becoming the first light

2081
02:02:11,121 --> 02:02:15,020
heavyweight to consecutively hold the
light heavyweight championship and the

2082
02:02:15,021 --> 02:02:19,400
heavyweight championship, you know,
and the spectacular fight by DC.

2083
02:02:19,401 --> 02:02:23,450
But Jon Jones is always going to be sure.
I mean there you cannot,

2084
02:02:23,840 --> 02:02:28,610
you can go on and on about the,
the extracurricular woes of John Jones.

2085
02:02:28,640 --> 02:02:33,330
Sure. His capabilities as an
athlete, his talent, his is, he,

2086
02:02:33,331 --> 02:02:37,400
it's undeniable, undeniable look,

2087
02:02:37,401 --> 02:02:40,280
whatever the fuck he took dick pills where
it's not making them a better fighter.

2088
02:02:40,281 --> 02:02:43,310
He didn't knock DC out because
of Dick Pills. That's crazy. No,

2089
02:02:43,410 --> 02:02:47,600
it has to do with great skill and talent.
Beautiful left high kick.

2090
02:02:47,601 --> 02:02:52,400
That's what it was. And he recognize a
tendency, you know, DC he has, you know,

2091
02:02:53,150 --> 02:02:56,570
uh, but with this whole you
Usada a process. It just became,

2092
02:02:56,571 --> 02:03:01,220
and it drug on because w you know,
we said to them,

2093
02:03:01,280 --> 02:03:04,700
I'm not going to take a punishment.
And they said we won't,

2094
02:03:04,730 --> 02:03:07,220
we're not giving you any option on this.
And so that's,

2095
02:03:07,730 --> 02:03:11,290
it's like there was this negotiation.
What happens, what I want,

2096
02:03:11,291 --> 02:03:14,030
one of the things that I've talked about
when it comes to police officers is

2097
02:03:14,031 --> 02:03:16,850
that when you have police officers and
the people they're trying to arrest,

2098
02:03:16,851 --> 02:03:19,790
it becomes a game. And I don't mean
a game in terms of his bullshit.

2099
02:03:19,791 --> 02:03:23,510
I mean it's a game in terms
of one person's trying to
win and they're trying to

2100
02:03:23,511 --> 02:03:24,650
get people and arrest him.

2101
02:03:24,670 --> 02:03:28,730
And this is why people plant guns and
plant drugs trying to win to try to win.

2102
02:03:28,731 --> 02:03:32,150
And that's what killed me was that to me,
in my opinion,

2103
02:03:32,151 --> 02:03:33,950
you Sada was trying to win.

2104
02:03:34,430 --> 02:03:38,480
It was more important for them to win
than it was for us to have a clean sport.

2105
02:03:38,510 --> 02:03:41,780
This comes back to what we're talking
about earlier when it comes to arguments

2106
02:03:41,781 --> 02:03:45,380
and discussions, then people oftentimes
are not really searching for the truth.

2107
02:03:45,381 --> 02:03:47,300
They just want to be, right. Yes.

2108
02:03:47,301 --> 02:03:50,930
And I've had this argument
about bureaucracies in
general, and this goes to,

2109
02:03:50,960 --> 02:03:54,110
this isn't just about, you know, not
Usada and they're bureaucratic elements.

2110
02:03:54,111 --> 02:03:56,450
I mean, they're like the
government. There are other things.

2111
02:03:56,451 --> 02:04:01,400
So you come and you say, Oh, you fucked
up. And then the bureaucracy's go, shit,

2112
02:04:02,300 --> 02:04:06,560
we didn't fuck up. And they're going
to say, we didn't fuck up to the very,

2113
02:04:06,561 --> 02:04:10,070
they'll take that to the very longest
lever until either a they'll scape goat

2114
02:04:10,071 --> 02:04:14,870
someone or be, they can figure out a
way that they didn't. Because looking,

2115
02:04:15,500 --> 02:04:20,210
making a mistake on a bureaucratic
level makes it seem like, okay,

2116
02:04:20,211 --> 02:04:24,290
well fuck if we f and here's the thing,
if you saw this as, oh, you know,

2117
02:04:24,291 --> 02:04:27,320
you're not you, you didn't,
you're not going to get punished.

2118
02:04:27,810 --> 02:04:32,660
Then Tim means and Yoel Romero
go, uh, why did I get punished?

2119
02:04:32,720 --> 02:04:36,680
Or if they, if you sat and say, Oh,
well, you know, that was a miss.

2120
02:04:36,700 --> 02:04:40,800
That was a mistake. Well, if that
was a mistake, we'll then, hey,

2121
02:04:40,920 --> 02:04:43,290
I got fucked on that mistake.
You got to take care of me.

2122
02:04:43,530 --> 02:04:48,360
So no drug testing is bad,
but too much oversight is also bad.

2123
02:04:48,361 --> 02:04:50,550
I think that a clean sport is,

2124
02:04:50,551 --> 02:04:54,030
is AOK and the idea of the
random testing and all is fine,

2125
02:04:54,031 --> 02:04:59,031
but you can't do it at the expense
of the athletes in that were in the

2126
02:04:59,521 --> 02:05:03,690
administration of the testing
that you're trying to blast them.

2127
02:05:03,691 --> 02:05:08,460
Like these three Brazilian guys that
just got busted over contamination that

2128
02:05:08,461 --> 02:05:11,820
they traced back to a compounding
pharmacy, those different things.

2129
02:05:12,210 --> 02:05:13,520
This is just recent,
uh,

2130
02:05:13,740 --> 02:05:17,100
three different guys in the UFC
and they were all getting, uh,

2131
02:05:17,190 --> 02:05:21,450
supplements from a compounding pharmacy
and everything was traced back to it.

2132
02:05:21,570 --> 02:05:24,060
It almost seems like you shouldn't
take any fucking supplements. Well,

2133
02:05:24,061 --> 02:05:25,620
that's the other thing.
It's like you'll do, we are,

2134
02:05:25,621 --> 02:05:29,070
we not allowed to take anything,
anything at all? Nothing. No on it.

2135
02:05:29,110 --> 02:05:32,040
What are supplements? What do they
do? They help your performance. Yeah.

2136
02:05:32,070 --> 02:05:34,890
You know what I mean? Should you take
no performance and answers? She should.

2137
02:05:34,891 --> 02:05:37,950
We take nothing. She just eat food. I
mean it's gotta be someone out there.

2138
02:05:37,951 --> 02:05:40,980
It's just, well there's food that will
enhance your performance too. Right?

2139
02:05:41,070 --> 02:05:45,150
Like kangaroo meat, the Frank Mir took
it takes a bad kangaroo meat and all man,

2140
02:05:45,151 --> 02:05:48,720
that kangaroo meat, fuck you get
a good pump on that. First of all,

2141
02:05:48,960 --> 02:05:53,400
ain't nobody giving steroids to kangaroo.
Okay. Kangaroos are fucking everywhere.

2142
02:05:53,401 --> 02:05:55,760
Investigation identify as
compounding pharmacies,

2143
02:05:55,780 --> 02:05:59,580
a source of tainted supplements behind
three positives and your don't. Santos,

2144
02:05:59,640 --> 02:06:03,930
Alameda and Antonio and yeah, uh,
Minotauro and here's the weird thing.

2145
02:06:03,931 --> 02:06:08,580
So it comes all the way down to it and
then they're there highlight on this is,

2146
02:06:09,390 --> 02:06:12,170
and you know, they've or we
put, gave him a suspension that,

2147
02:06:12,171 --> 02:06:15,480
but at the time has already lapsed so they
won't actually have to serve any time.

2148
02:06:15,480 --> 02:06:19,410
It's like, but you just fucking
suspended them nonetheless.

2149
02:06:19,860 --> 02:06:21,270
You didn't have to do that.
Right.

2150
02:06:21,570 --> 02:06:24,600
So they took seven or eight months
or whatever for this get cleared up.

2151
02:06:24,660 --> 02:06:28,890
And that's unfortunate. Junior tested
positive for a diuretic, is that correct?

2152
02:06:29,040 --> 02:06:32,220
That's what it was. Which uses your
cloth something. I just diarrhetic,

2153
02:06:32,221 --> 02:06:35,070
which is crazy because he's a fucking
heavyweight. Not losing any weight.

2154
02:06:35,460 --> 02:06:38,620
Junior's not on the high side of
heavyweight. He's not like a to 65 God.

2155
02:06:38,621 --> 02:06:40,970
It's kind of wait to make the upper limit.
Well,

2156
02:06:40,990 --> 02:06:42,650
he's just trying to keep those
wrinkles out of his face.

2157
02:06:42,660 --> 02:06:45,840
Just trying to look good, baby. That's
right. Does diuretics make you look good?

2158
02:06:45,841 --> 02:06:48,480
Fuck. I don't know. I don't know. I
thought it makes you show yourself.

2159
02:06:49,370 --> 02:06:53,940
Just try to do, essentially, it just pulls
all the polls, all the water on bones.

2160
02:06:53,941 --> 02:06:55,560
Jones,
keeping in mind life is a journey,

2161
02:06:55,561 --> 02:06:59,730
not a race and God's will for me to
be there. Blah, blah, blah, blah.

2162
02:07:00,130 --> 02:07:00,571
I forget.

2163
02:07:00,571 --> 02:07:02,700
I'm still the youngest guy in the top
five of heavyweight and light everywhere.

2164
02:07:02,701 --> 02:07:07,530
Yeah, he's young. What does
that, what is unique music?

2165
02:07:07,620 --> 02:07:10,440
What does that someone's account.
Oh,

2166
02:07:10,570 --> 02:07:14,140
was he responding to somebody tweeted
that a couple of hours ago. Hmm.

2167
02:07:14,220 --> 02:07:16,710
It's up to a four year span right now.

2168
02:07:17,010 --> 02:07:20,550
He remains a provisional suspension of
wind in the outcome of the situation with

2169
02:07:20,551 --> 02:07:23,460
Usada after testing positive for steroids.

2170
02:07:23,790 --> 02:07:28,110
Last July following the knock out one
of over call me. Um, was it a steroid?

2171
02:07:29,340 --> 02:07:31,200
Uh, man, I couldn't tell you.

2172
02:07:31,860 --> 02:07:36,470
John faces up to four year suspension
due to second. You have anti-doping

2173
02:07:36,520 --> 02:07:38,770
poverty policy, but obviously
the young side ever champion.

2174
02:07:39,020 --> 02:07:42,490
But obviously first of all
when it says second violation,

2175
02:07:42,491 --> 02:07:46,570
the first violation was proven to be
something tainted. So it's, he's not,

2176
02:07:46,870 --> 02:07:51,460
when you say violation, I want, I
want to hear this guy took steroids.

2177
02:07:51,700 --> 02:07:55,930
He took steroids because he was trying
to get it performance enhancing a result

2178
02:07:55,931 --> 02:08:00,640
from it. Suspend that guy. I don't
want to hear, oh he got toothpaste.

2179
02:08:00,641 --> 02:08:04,060
It's from China and it had fucking
something in it. You remember that too?

2180
02:08:04,061 --> 02:08:04,841
Don't you want that?

2181
02:08:04,841 --> 02:08:08,320
A fucking crazy story about the
toothpaste that had some poisons in it or

2182
02:08:08,321 --> 02:08:11,440
something that they were selling in China.
Yeah. What was that? Some wild shit.

2183
02:08:11,890 --> 02:08:15,530
What was that toothpaste in China then?
The poison in it.

2184
02:08:16,130 --> 02:08:18,880
I'm vaguely remembering this. I just
said it just cause it sounds stupid,

2185
02:08:18,910 --> 02:08:20,320
but it's a real thing.
Yeah.

2186
02:08:20,320 --> 02:08:22,540
I think you just made it up
and all of a sudden it's true.

2187
02:08:22,600 --> 02:08:25,700
It's probably in the back of my
memory somewhere that I just, I hear,

2188
02:08:25,701 --> 02:08:29,140
hear what you're saying. Toxic
toothpaste made in China. Found us.

2189
02:08:29,360 --> 02:08:31,800
Look at it for sure. A fresh,
sure. Fresh. Sure. Fred.

2190
02:08:31,810 --> 02:08:35,310
That's like some people that don't
really understand English. Sure. What?

2191
02:08:35,311 --> 02:08:40,210
What does that mean? I don't know
Sheila. Good. Very good. Shira shellfish.

2192
02:08:40,330 --> 02:08:44,980
I think it's a Chinese romantization
of Chinese words door in Maine.

2193
02:08:44,981 --> 02:08:49,150
They're trying to kill people in name. Oh
yeah. It's one of those green up there.

2194
02:08:49,151 --> 02:08:53,380
Pay for, what is it? What was in
it? Antifreeze. Okay, cool. Cool.

2195
02:08:53,410 --> 02:08:55,110
It's main look at how
cold it gets it there.

2196
02:08:55,240 --> 02:08:56,400
Why wouldn't you need
any of these reasons?

2197
02:08:56,440 --> 02:08:59,590
People that they were doing a good job.
I want to teeth falling out.

2198
02:08:59,720 --> 02:09:03,520
Freezing shattering.
Glycols little propylene glycol.

2199
02:09:05,290 --> 02:09:08,740
Oh,
I'm 100% for testing.

2200
02:09:08,770 --> 02:09:12,700
I'm 100% for them stopping people from
taking performance enhancing drugs,

2201
02:09:12,701 --> 02:09:15,640
but this sounds very heavy handed.
It was just an I'm,

2202
02:09:15,730 --> 02:09:18,640
I had no problem with the system.
And then this,

2203
02:09:18,940 --> 02:09:22,600
the way it unfolded to me, it
was just like, this is, I don't,

2204
02:09:22,630 --> 02:09:25,180
I don't need to be fighting
multiple fronts. What?

2205
02:09:25,181 --> 02:09:28,840
I'm just trying to do everything I can
to stay to stay in this as an athlete.

2206
02:09:28,960 --> 02:09:30,070
Now,
when you first started,

2207
02:09:30,071 --> 02:09:34,600
I mean you won the UFC heavyweight
title in 2001 two at 24 years old,

2208
02:09:35,010 --> 02:09:39,310
youngest ever. Um, when you won, that
meant everybody was on some shit.

2209
02:09:39,460 --> 02:09:43,600
It was just, it was the beginning
of the cleanup everywhere.

2210
02:09:43,870 --> 02:09:47,860
And even then going into the Nevada state
athletic commission, previous to that,

2211
02:09:47,980 --> 02:09:49,840
before [inaudible] bought the UFC,

2212
02:09:50,140 --> 02:09:53,590
the idea of having giant fights
in Vegas was fucking a win.

2213
02:09:53,620 --> 02:09:57,730
It was a possibility. No, it was
not going to happen. And even then,

2214
02:09:57,731 --> 02:10:02,731
like the testing back in 2002
that wasn't official per se.

2215
02:10:06,450 --> 02:10:09,520
It was like, it was like, it was Esther
over him when he fought Brock Lesnar.

2216
02:10:09,521 --> 02:10:13,780
Fuck 2002. How about when we
saw the Rheem, when he was,

2217
02:10:14,050 --> 02:10:17,740
when he was Uber Rheem, when he was
ubering? When he fought Brock Lesnar,

2218
02:10:17,890 --> 02:10:20,410
Jesus fucking Christ.
Damn Comic Book Hero.

2219
02:10:20,790 --> 02:10:25,240
I mean there is not a God
damn drug testing agent alive.

2220
02:10:25,241 --> 02:10:28,310
That would have been great.
Grab him, hold him down.

2221
02:10:28,360 --> 02:10:33,360
He's clearly overnight that that guy
did get the picture of him on the scale

2222
02:10:33,600 --> 02:10:36,780
mean. That picture's amazing. Look
at both of them. Yeah, they're both,

2223
02:10:38,840 --> 02:10:43,520
but that one hold them down. Everybody
would have been like, hang on, hang on.

2224
02:10:43,521 --> 02:10:47,120
What did needle even, could you
even get a needle in his vein? Dude,

2225
02:10:47,121 --> 02:10:50,480
he's just like pings Benz.
He was so jacked.

2226
02:10:51,040 --> 02:10:54,950
This part of me just wishes he would
leave and go to Japan and go right back to

2227
02:10:54,951 --> 02:10:57,170
it. You know, just fill him up.

2228
02:11:01,340 --> 02:11:04,190
I mean look, everybody knew
what the fuck it was back then.

2229
02:11:05,090 --> 02:11:08,670
I mean it's interesting like Brock
Lesnar being back, Brock Lesner,

2230
02:11:08,680 --> 02:11:09,900
he's not asking for over him.

2231
02:11:09,930 --> 02:11:14,010
Over him was the last guy to really fuck
him up and he wants to fight DC and he

2232
02:11:14,050 --> 02:11:17,270
brought in Overeem's just not the
same guy anymore. Clearly not.

2233
02:11:17,360 --> 02:11:22,040
He does not perform at the same
level as he does. Still very good,

2234
02:11:22,070 --> 02:11:23,810
but he's still very dangerous.
Here's the thing,

2235
02:11:23,811 --> 02:11:26,000
even when he was a two o five pounder,
right.

2236
02:11:26,001 --> 02:11:30,590
And he had a tendency to gas
out, gas out and get, you know,

2237
02:11:30,620 --> 02:11:35,150
be Chiney to a degree.
But he was always super technical,

2238
02:11:35,630 --> 02:11:39,390
highly skilled.
I don't think you could Overeem,

2239
02:11:39,700 --> 02:11:44,360
him and his brother both are actually
very good fighters. Yeah. And you know,

2240
02:11:44,361 --> 02:11:48,020
their struggles. I've never been a
physical one for the most part. I think,

2241
02:11:48,021 --> 02:11:48,650
you know,
they've had,

2242
02:11:48,650 --> 02:11:53,000
and that's a difficulty that that is most
common amongst fighters is the mental

2243
02:11:53,001 --> 02:11:57,500
game of it. Well, we saw that within
Ghana this week. Yeah. We see the fight,

2244
02:11:57,501 --> 02:12:00,830
but I heard it was one for the ages.
It was one for the ages.

2245
02:12:01,580 --> 02:12:04,970
Let some lines loosen that thing and just
like, okay, let's crank this up a bit.

2246
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:06,530
It was the worst heavyweight
fight I've ever seen.

2247
02:12:07,100 --> 02:12:11,600
It was the worst in of mine before
he came down to,

2248
02:12:11,930 --> 02:12:13,880
it came down to the sea.

2249
02:12:13,910 --> 02:12:18,260
It was the second lowest
output fight ever. Uh,

2250
02:12:18,620 --> 02:12:21,170
they couldn't even make it the
lowest output fight to be number one.

2251
02:12:21,171 --> 02:12:23,000
I didn't even get to number one.
Number one,

2252
02:12:23,510 --> 02:12:28,510
they failed it failing Jens Pulver versus
Joe Hoke from like a fucking UFC 13 or

2253
02:12:31,161 --> 02:12:33,560
some shit.
I don't even know what day that fight was,

2254
02:12:33,980 --> 02:12:38,980
but that fight was number one with 23
or 22 strikes landed in three rounds and

2255
02:12:42,051 --> 02:12:46,310
this fight was number two with 23
strikes landed. That's weird dude.

2256
02:12:46,311 --> 02:12:48,590
It was insane.
And then ovary,

2257
02:12:48,620 --> 02:12:52,310
I mean a Francis go to Francis
and Ghana was a Instagram.

2258
02:12:52,430 --> 02:12:56,630
He released a statement today and his
statement was essentially that he was a

2259
02:12:56,631 --> 02:13:00,530
over, he carried the fear. He said,
I'm not proud of my last performance.

2260
02:13:00,531 --> 02:13:04,130
I have carried my fear from
the last fight to this one.

2261
02:13:04,280 --> 02:13:07,970
I completely understand the frustration,
anger that it's caused my fans, coaches,

2262
02:13:07,971 --> 02:13:09,440
teammates and family and friends,

2263
02:13:09,441 --> 02:13:13,250
weird that he would have fear from
the last item. We got fucking owned,

2264
02:13:14,510 --> 02:13:15,920
wrestled.
He didn't know.

2265
02:13:16,080 --> 02:13:19,990
He thought he was the man
and then he got owned won't,

2266
02:13:20,210 --> 02:13:22,010
but he's letting everyone down again.

2267
02:13:22,370 --> 02:13:24,770
All I can do now is proved
myself and make you proud again.

2268
02:13:24,771 --> 02:13:27,830
But look at this picture that he
puts up his swinging on him, him,

2269
02:13:27,831 --> 02:13:31,830
him connected one punch.
I mean that's kind funny.

2270
02:13:32,310 --> 02:13:36,270
It should've been him with his head down
Frances. In the future, if you're gonna,

2271
02:13:36,300 --> 02:13:39,480
if you're gonna post a humble
shot, look humble. Yeah.

2272
02:13:39,570 --> 02:13:44,120
This is like I'm calling him. I can't say
that, that he doesn't legitimately made,

2273
02:13:44,160 --> 02:13:48,990
maybe he is carrying some kind of fear
from the last fight in terms of losing

2274
02:13:48,991 --> 02:13:53,640
the result or is a lot of mind fuck that
can go into being a fighter and yeah.

2275
02:13:53,700 --> 02:13:57,180
But uh,
with bounce back,

2276
02:13:57,210 --> 02:14:00,420
you've been on both sides and you know,

2277
02:14:00,540 --> 02:14:04,380
the first fight back after a kale
loss or after getting dominated,

2278
02:14:04,381 --> 02:14:08,190
what does that feeling
like? That's a good, yeah.

2279
02:14:09,360 --> 02:14:12,300
I don't know. I've been at this shit
for so long that for me it's just like,

2280
02:14:12,740 --> 02:14:15,930
all right, that was then, this is
now don't make the same mistakes.

2281
02:14:17,310 --> 02:14:20,220
Everything you've been submitted,
you've been knocked out,

2282
02:14:20,221 --> 02:14:23,100
you've knocked guys out,
you submitted guys who've won the title.

2283
02:14:23,310 --> 02:14:26,670
You beat some of the best guys in the
world. You've had fantastic performances.

2284
02:14:26,671 --> 02:14:28,440
You'd have performances
that frustrated you,

2285
02:14:28,770 --> 02:14:32,490
you've experienced at all you've
got in your long career. I mean,

2286
02:14:32,491 --> 02:14:36,300
from being the youngest ever
heavyweight champion of the world ever.

2287
02:14:36,480 --> 02:14:40,560
To how old are you now? 40. 40,
man. Dude, you fucking seen it all.

2288
02:14:40,890 --> 02:14:45,450
You've literally seen it all.
How long do you think you can do a,

2289
02:14:45,451 --> 02:14:50,160
I don't know, but I'm planning to run it
out. You do have a lot more in Japan, bro.

2290
02:14:50,790 --> 02:14:54,060
Keep going. I also have
this bad car habit. Yeah.

2291
02:14:55,590 --> 02:14:59,160
That need cash. Yeah. Yeah.
Well, you know, for 55,

2292
02:14:59,161 --> 02:15:04,161
Pontiacs don't get built and put into
a 75 trans ams Firebirds for free.

2293
02:15:04,560 --> 02:15:07,320
Well, sometimes they do. If you
have the time, that's anything.

2294
02:15:07,350 --> 02:15:10,110
How are you going to work on your car
when you're off all over the world doing

2295
02:15:10,111 --> 02:15:13,370
all this shit, right? Doing
seminars and doing pro wrestling.

2296
02:15:13,380 --> 02:15:17,520
Common to all my fighters. I had
two guys just fight, uh, last, uh,

2297
02:15:17,521 --> 02:15:21,840
this Friday at CSF in Burbank. One of
them defended his title, a Jay Bryant,

2298
02:15:21,841 --> 02:15:24,870
the other ones show a moto on his fight.
And for people who don't know,

2299
02:15:24,871 --> 02:15:29,310
that's not lucrative to train fighters.
I mean at the very highest level,

2300
02:15:29,311 --> 02:15:34,110
it's barely lucrative. Barely. Yeah.
I'm not, this isn't a money thing.

2301
02:15:34,111 --> 02:15:35,160
This is a passion project,

2302
02:15:35,320 --> 02:15:39,390
but he's training guys out of with
Jim I the UFC gym in La Mirada,

2303
02:15:39,840 --> 02:15:44,840
let us use it for a fantastic feat and
we get use of all 55,000 square feet.

2304
02:15:45,360 --> 02:15:48,270
Oh, that's nice. We also
work a lot with Chad.

2305
02:15:48,271 --> 02:15:53,090
George has a gym called Cmma and we'll
send you, we'll go down there too. Nice.

2306
02:15:53,640 --> 02:15:58,170
Good comradery between John Marotta.
Where's that at? Northern Orange County,

2307
02:15:58,600 --> 02:16:01,590
I would say. Yeah. Is it like, um,

2308
02:16:02,730 --> 02:16:05,240
what's it like Northern Ireland?
It was the border of Orange County,

2309
02:16:05,460 --> 02:16:08,490
La county at that border.
It's either southern,

2310
02:16:08,491 --> 02:16:13,140
most La county or northern most orange
county. It's that kind of thing.

2311
02:16:14,180 --> 02:16:18,510
Yeah. Those UFC gyms are fucking bad
ass. They are great job. Super Nice.

2312
02:16:18,511 --> 02:16:20,730
And plus they've been an
opportunity for fighters.

2313
02:16:20,731 --> 02:16:25,560
I think cub and Bisping also
have stakes in some, you know,

2314
02:16:25,570 --> 02:16:29,500
CJ does as well. I believe Frankie Edgar
does. Frankie has one in Tom's river.

2315
02:16:30,410 --> 02:16:33,250
Um, yeah. There's, uh, there's
quite a few of them now. I mean,

2316
02:16:33,251 --> 02:16:34,510
they're all over the place.
Yeah.

2317
02:16:34,570 --> 02:16:37,930
If you look at for a place to hit the
heavy bag and work out and liquidate some

2318
02:16:37,931 --> 02:16:38,920
martial arts classes,

2319
02:16:39,500 --> 02:16:43,070
cages and maths and all that.
And so we use those facilities.

2320
02:16:43,071 --> 02:16:46,460
They've been really great to
us and uh, yeah, with these,

2321
02:16:46,461 --> 02:16:49,130
these kids that I work with
and they are pretty much kids,

2322
02:16:49,131 --> 02:16:52,500
it's just about trying to
help people achieve, you know,

2323
02:16:52,540 --> 02:16:54,740
work towards the things that
they want as an athlete,

2324
02:16:54,741 --> 02:16:58,610
but also they're good people that I want
to see them make the most out of their

2325
02:16:58,611 --> 02:17:00,350
life.
Yeah.

2326
02:17:00,590 --> 02:17:05,030
So I'm trying to be a person that can
be a positive influence in terms of,

2327
02:17:05,430 --> 02:17:05,600
you know,

2328
02:17:05,600 --> 02:17:09,950
bringing philosophy and ethics to their
life and helping them be good people and,

2329
02:17:09,951 --> 02:17:11,870
and to pass that kind of shit on.

2330
02:17:11,871 --> 02:17:15,320
Be the ripple in the water that the drop
in the water that sends ripples out and

2331
02:17:15,321 --> 02:17:16,990
makes a positive effect on other folks.

2332
02:17:17,110 --> 02:17:19,610
Throw you a poet.
What the fuck?

2333
02:17:19,640 --> 02:17:22,640
I know brodes is something comes to me,
man.

2334
02:17:22,641 --> 02:17:25,430
You should put that on an Instagram
picture and show your butt because that's

2335
02:17:25,431 --> 02:17:28,580
where a lot of those girls
do. I don't to show that, but,

2336
02:17:28,730 --> 02:17:30,680
and then they have like something about,
you know,

2337
02:17:30,681 --> 02:17:33,740
don't like negative negativity into
your life because the ripples of that

2338
02:17:33,741 --> 02:17:36,950
negativity can infect the people
around you and you don't want that stay

2339
02:17:36,951 --> 02:17:38,360
positive.
Look on my ass.

2340
02:17:39,370 --> 02:17:43,160
Fucking pull up on them on these.
Look at that peach.

2341
02:17:45,050 --> 02:17:48,890
Yeah. Um, I think that UFC
gym is a brilliant thing,

2342
02:17:48,960 --> 02:17:50,930
so brilliant move. You
know, cause if I'm like,

2343
02:17:51,020 --> 02:17:54,530
if I see 24 hour fitness and it's
right next to the UFC gym, like Oh,

2344
02:17:54,590 --> 02:17:59,000
fucking heavy bags, everything. What
the fights are on TV. Yes. Put that on.

2345
02:17:59,001 --> 02:17:59,900
They also,
uh,

2346
02:18:00,080 --> 02:18:03,510
at least the one in La Mirada has like
a whole little section that has astro

2347
02:18:03,511 --> 02:18:06,290
turf down and all that with ladders.

2348
02:18:06,290 --> 02:18:08,730
It had been painted into it so
he can do foot drills. Oh, nice.

2349
02:18:08,760 --> 02:18:12,290
They've got a sleds and tires and shit.
I mean,

2350
02:18:12,291 --> 02:18:15,650
so you can do other nonconventional
workouts, kettle bells.

2351
02:18:16,040 --> 02:18:18,740
So they have a really like a real
strength and conditioning. Yes, yes.

2352
02:18:18,741 --> 02:18:20,570
I mean you can do really anything.

2353
02:18:20,571 --> 02:18:24,770
They have a whole set up of TRX is and
shit like that shit. Yeah. That's bad ass.

2354
02:18:25,190 --> 02:18:26,001
Yeah,
that's a,

2355
02:18:26,001 --> 02:18:29,090
I mean that's what you want from a
gym and he'd go to a lot of gems.

2356
02:18:29,091 --> 02:18:32,360
They just don't have that kind of stuff.
You know, they have your standard stuff,

2357
02:18:32,390 --> 02:18:37,100
you know, machines and shit
could lift with. It's just
not, not quite good enough.

2358
02:18:37,460 --> 02:18:41,210
I agree. And so this gives you
that, that full spectrum to,

2359
02:18:41,260 --> 02:18:43,610
to work in whatever ways you
want to just about, yeah.

2360
02:18:43,670 --> 02:18:47,150
Would you be interested in open owning
your own gym? Sometimes I think about it.

2361
02:18:47,420 --> 02:18:48,960
I do. I wouldn't mind having, having

2362
02:18:48,960 --> 02:18:52,630
my own gym, but it's just,
it's such a, I don't want to,

2363
02:18:52,690 --> 02:18:53,820
burden isn't the right word,

2364
02:18:53,821 --> 02:18:55,830
but there's just a lot of responsibility
that comes with it. You know,

2365
02:18:55,831 --> 02:18:59,730
the overhead of having a place
and creating a program, uh,

2366
02:18:59,731 --> 02:19:02,520
and having people manage
and run those programs.

2367
02:19:03,030 --> 02:19:06,390
And with me being as busy as I am,
um,

2368
02:19:06,900 --> 02:19:08,490
I wouldn't want to do anything half ass.

2369
02:19:08,550 --> 02:19:12,060
And I also don't want
to commit to something.

2370
02:19:12,061 --> 02:19:15,210
And then not be able to put into
it what I think is necessary.

2371
02:19:15,360 --> 02:19:19,410
You obviously love teaching. I, I
do. I do love to teach. Yeah. I like,

2372
02:19:19,900 --> 02:19:23,790
for me, it was such a big
thing in my life. The people,

2373
02:19:23,940 --> 02:19:28,190
not just a in terms of athletics,
but the people mentored

2374
02:19:28,190 --> 02:19:33,190
me and helped to mold and shape me and
help give me the tools and sometimes a

2375
02:19:33,201 --> 02:19:37,670
kick in the ass as needed to move me along
in life to get me to where I am today,

2376
02:19:37,671 --> 02:19:40,750
to give me not just in terms
of, you know, what, what you,

2377
02:19:40,760 --> 02:19:44,480
you would argue for is successful or not,
but just to be the person than I am.

2378
02:19:44,660 --> 02:19:48,260
And while far from perfect,
uh, you know, I can't,

2379
02:19:48,740 --> 02:19:53,740
I can't think about exchanging bad moments
for different moments in my life for

2380
02:19:56,271 --> 02:19:59,350
the fear of that. I wouldn't
be who I am today. You know,

2381
02:19:59,370 --> 02:20:02,230
a Nisha talks about eternal recurrence
and one of the idea of that is,

2382
02:20:02,740 --> 02:20:07,310
is that um, and your loneliest
of loneliness of a demon
showed up and it said,

2383
02:20:07,311 --> 02:20:07,401
well,

2384
02:20:07,401 --> 02:20:11,810
you're going to live your life in every
way as you ever have in every single

2385
02:20:12,110 --> 02:20:16,370
aspect of it. It's like, well, you
have to, you have to be okay with that.

2386
02:20:16,820 --> 02:20:20,420
You have to live a life that,
that, that's, that's reasonable.

2387
02:20:20,480 --> 02:20:23,390
That you would be fine with
doing it all over again,

2388
02:20:23,391 --> 02:20:25,280
doing it all over again
if you're going to become,

2389
02:20:25,340 --> 02:20:29,480
if you're going to be specific, she better
like pushing a rock up a hill. Right?

2390
02:20:29,481 --> 02:20:32,960
Whatever mistakes you've made, they've
made you who you are right now. Correct.

2391
02:20:33,220 --> 02:20:36,830
As long as it's not catastrophic to the
point where you've caused a loss of life

2392
02:20:36,831 --> 02:20:40,550
or someone's devastated and destroyed
someone else's life, you hope not.

2393
02:20:40,690 --> 02:20:42,680
I hope not. I mean, you know,

2394
02:20:42,750 --> 02:20:46,850
it's interesting thing like that there's
the concept of reincarnation. There's,

2395
02:20:46,851 --> 02:20:49,100
there's many concepts.
One of them is the,

2396
02:20:49,220 --> 02:20:54,220
one of the most haunting for some people
is that you will live your life over

2397
02:20:54,321 --> 02:20:56,630
again. Exactly the same
way until you get it right.

2398
02:20:56,810 --> 02:20:59,270
I actually heard Leo Gracie
talking about this once,

2399
02:21:00,050 --> 02:21:03,110
that everything in your life, every
mistake, every choice you make,

2400
02:21:03,290 --> 02:21:04,730
if you do not do the correct thing,

2401
02:21:04,731 --> 02:21:07,820
he believed that you would have to come
back again and do it all over again.

2402
02:21:07,821 --> 02:21:10,940
Exactly the same way. And this is his
philosophy, the way he lived his life.

2403
02:21:11,360 --> 02:21:12,860
That's terrifying for people.

2404
02:21:13,040 --> 02:21:15,590
This idea that somehow or another
you're going almost like you're going to

2405
02:21:15,591 --> 02:21:19,940
repeat high school, start off. But
here's what happens. The brutal,

2406
02:21:19,970 --> 02:21:24,050
brutal period of my life. Mine too. But
here's my question. I think everybody's,

2407
02:21:24,740 --> 02:21:27,770
and the people who it wasn't brutal
for those fucking people turn out to be

2408
02:21:27,771 --> 02:21:28,604
losing

2409
02:21:31,610 --> 02:21:34,620
the stories are that the fucking
homecoming king and this, I mean,

2410
02:21:34,621 --> 02:21:38,070
that's like a fucking Billy Joel Song.
The king and the queen of the prom.

2411
02:21:38,800 --> 02:21:41,880
You know, that's a, it
seems from an Italian recipe

2412
02:21:41,880 --> 02:21:46,440
shrunk. That's, that's literally the, the
premise of that song. I think it was a,

2413
02:21:46,740 --> 02:21:49,910
it was, uh, um, uh, I'm mortal song too.

2414
02:21:50,300 --> 02:21:52,530
Norway brand new in any way.
The puppy to,

2415
02:21:52,610 --> 02:21:56,640
he's in the king and the queen of the
prom running around with the cod top down

2416
02:21:56,641 --> 02:21:57,790
in the [inaudible].

2417
02:21:59,070 --> 02:22:03,030
Nobody looked any finer who was
more of a head of the Parkway Dinah.

2418
02:22:03,270 --> 02:22:06,420
And we never knew we could walk more
than that at alive. Remember that

2419
02:22:08,220 --> 02:22:12,960
Billy Joel, I don't know it as well
as you do. Whoa. It's a good song.

2420
02:22:13,200 --> 02:22:18,000
Um, the idea of living your life over
again. It's terrifying for people though.

2421
02:22:18,660 --> 02:22:22,640
Dying alone. The living over and over
and over again for in finisher, but,

2422
02:22:22,650 --> 02:22:26,070
but why is that when living right now

2423
02:22:26,280 --> 02:22:29,040
is fine for most of us. I
mean, unless you're depressed,

2424
02:22:29,130 --> 02:22:33,510
unless you depressing life's
a wreck living right now
it's like, okay, I'm alive.

2425
02:22:33,570 --> 02:22:36,680
I'm here, I'm doing it. Sure. Why
scared to do it over and over and over.

2426
02:22:36,690 --> 02:22:39,000
We had forever.
It's a strange thing.

2427
02:22:39,690 --> 02:22:42,000
Like there's something like
the futility of it all.

2428
02:22:42,001 --> 02:22:45,710
The idea that this is just a
repeating cycle that's just going to

2429
02:22:46,020 --> 02:22:47,520
you forever.
Well,

2430
02:22:47,640 --> 02:22:51,990
that would end in the idea that there
would be nothing that you could do to make

2431
02:22:51,991 --> 02:22:56,660
any effect to it. I mean to me, fuck,

2432
02:22:56,700 --> 02:23:00,090
even, even still, like I
couldn't, me personally,

2433
02:23:00,091 --> 02:23:02,510
I couldn't think of something
that in terms of like a,

2434
02:23:02,570 --> 02:23:07,290
I want to do something that as a
mental idea as like as a mind game,

2435
02:23:07,291 --> 02:23:11,670
that if I live my life in a way that
I could be okay with doing it all over

2436
02:23:11,671 --> 02:23:14,610
again. Just exactly the same
way. And here's the other thing,

2437
02:23:14,611 --> 02:23:18,420
would you know that it's going to
happen like that? How could you, well,

2438
02:23:18,421 --> 02:23:22,260
there was a, I kind of, I wish
I could remember who it was.

2439
02:23:22,261 --> 02:23:26,220
There was this philosopher
who was saying that

2440
02:23:27,930 --> 02:23:32,850
if you were given the ability
to absolutely and utterly
control your dreams in

2441
02:23:32,880 --> 02:23:36,990
all aspects and elements of it,
and so at first most people would,

2442
02:23:37,200 --> 02:23:41,340
would go to sleep and they would turn
it into every fucking wonderful thing

2443
02:23:41,341 --> 02:23:42,060
they've ever wanted.

2444
02:23:42,060 --> 02:23:45,120
They would just be the ultimate winner at
everything all the time, always. Right.

2445
02:23:45,210 --> 02:23:49,170
And then they would get tired of that
and then they would create chaos and

2446
02:23:49,171 --> 02:23:51,180
catastrophe and, and, and, and, you know,

2447
02:23:51,181 --> 02:23:54,150
make meat probably make everything
is horrible for themselves.

2448
02:23:54,151 --> 02:23:57,720
And they could possibly do.
And as they're going through these cycles,

2449
02:23:57,750 --> 02:24:02,130
ultimately the one thing that you're
going to end up wanting in the end is that

2450
02:24:02,131 --> 02:24:04,980
you just don't know what's
going to happen at all by,

2451
02:24:05,180 --> 02:24:09,720
by knowing everything prior to
it, to it occurring, it takes,

2452
02:24:10,650 --> 02:24:15,300
the want to experience it
away is Cormac Mccarthy wrote,

2453
02:24:15,390 --> 02:24:18,480
uh, um, how many people,

2454
02:24:18,481 --> 02:24:23,340
if they knew the path of their lives,
which still choose to live it. Ooh,

2455
02:24:23,880 --> 02:24:24,713
right.

2456
02:24:24,780 --> 02:24:27,270
Well there isn't that ultimately
expressed by fighting.

2457
02:24:27,540 --> 02:24:30,570
Like fighting is the ultimate expression
of that because when you step into that

2458
02:24:30,571 --> 02:24:31,404
cage,

2459
02:24:31,530 --> 02:24:34,940
if it's just you and you're looking
across the ring and another guy who's a,

2460
02:24:34,941 --> 02:24:39,941
a legitimate top flight mixed martial
artists and you really don't know,

2461
02:24:40,800 --> 02:24:44,700
I have a theory about fighting
and that fighting is actually a,

2462
02:24:45,180 --> 02:24:46,020
not the only,

2463
02:24:46,021 --> 02:24:51,021
but a great conduit into what I think of
as the highest point of is of being as

2464
02:24:53,731 --> 02:24:57,330
a human being that you
can enter into this state,

2465
02:24:57,840 --> 02:25:01,490
that it's not a place that you can
exist that all the time, like it's,

2466
02:25:01,491 --> 02:25:05,070
it's just not possible.
But when you reach it,

2467
02:25:05,490 --> 02:25:10,490
it's as if you are so
alive and you were at your,

2468
02:25:11,340 --> 02:25:15,960
the peak of being at that moment.
And even though it is,

2469
02:25:15,961 --> 02:25:18,340
it is brought on through,
through being in the, the,

2470
02:25:18,710 --> 02:25:21,930
the intensity and the stress of combat.
Uh,

2471
02:25:22,260 --> 02:25:27,260
it's as if every aspect of your
being is charged in electric and,

2472
02:25:27,331 --> 02:25:31,300
and living and being, but it's not a
place that you could be at all the time.

2473
02:25:31,301 --> 02:25:33,820
You would just be a maniac.
I,

2474
02:25:33,821 --> 02:25:37,900
it's not a place that human beings
can exist in for more than maybe short

2475
02:25:37,901 --> 02:25:40,040
periods of time.
Hmm.

2476
02:25:40,800 --> 02:25:45,450
Well, your senses have to be
insanely heightened. Your,

2477
02:25:45,451 --> 02:25:48,270
your, you, the consequences
of your actions are grave.

2478
02:25:48,300 --> 02:25:51,330
The only thing that really is
elevated passed out as war.

2479
02:25:51,810 --> 02:25:56,520
And one of the things that you find about
war and Sebastian younger wrote about

2480
02:25:56,521 --> 02:25:57,720
this in his book tribe,

2481
02:25:58,050 --> 02:26:01,170
is that the people that experience
it have an incredibly difficult time

2482
02:26:01,171 --> 02:26:04,920
adjusting to regular life and they
really miss it and want to go back to it

2483
02:26:04,921 --> 02:26:05,870
because they never felt more right.

2484
02:26:06,050 --> 02:26:08,640
I believe that that
war is a similar place.

2485
02:26:08,641 --> 02:26:13,350
I think that when you are faced
with death that that is a,

2486
02:26:13,500 --> 02:26:18,290
a conduit to bringing you towards
that highest point of, of being. Mm.

2487
02:26:18,390 --> 02:26:21,600
And uh, yeah, I suppose it,

2488
02:26:21,601 --> 02:26:25,080
it's like that once you get past that
point of theirs and there is no fear at

2489
02:26:25,081 --> 02:26:29,400
that, that level either. It is just an,
it is a way, it's just an existence.

2490
02:26:29,430 --> 02:26:31,470
You don't consider,
you don't think,

2491
02:26:31,471 --> 02:26:35,730
you don't think something
isn't this or that. It just is.

2492
02:26:36,660 --> 02:26:41,500
And it's a, a place that you
can't be forever wouldn't,

2493
02:26:41,560 --> 02:26:42,630
it doesn't work that way.

2494
02:26:42,631 --> 02:26:47,631
But when you've been there and you're
just out here dealing with petty can

2495
02:26:48,481 --> 02:26:51,760
Internet trolls and dumb shit
and people doing stuff that,

2496
02:26:51,761 --> 02:26:54,960
that cut their nose to spite their
face and undermining this and you know,

2497
02:26:55,290 --> 02:26:59,610
the fabric of our relationships for
no good reason. It's, it's tough to,

2498
02:26:59,820 --> 02:27:03,550
to sit in, exist in this and
go, fuck, you know, I how,

2499
02:27:04,410 --> 02:27:07,650
how do you get back to that other thing?
There's this state of purity,

2500
02:27:08,340 --> 02:27:10,990
this existence of where these,

2501
02:27:11,070 --> 02:27:13,590
none of those things matter anymore.

2502
02:27:14,660 --> 02:27:18,020
I don't know if she can, I mean
you, you might have, I mean look,

2503
02:27:18,360 --> 02:27:22,490
we have a certain amount of time on this,
on this planet, in this life, right?

2504
02:27:22,520 --> 02:27:25,040
You have a hundred years.
If everything goes great,

2505
02:27:25,550 --> 02:27:29,060
you can't really expect
to just live in that.

2506
02:27:30,300 --> 02:27:35,300
That perfect state of both chaos,

2507
02:27:35,690 --> 02:27:36,710
n n

2508
02:27:40,110 --> 02:27:44,980
chaos and I guess being
in the moment there's,

2509
02:27:45,150 --> 02:27:49,560
there's something about something
that's dangerous and intense and

2510
02:27:49,680 --> 02:27:54,680
overwhelmingly filled with anticipation
beforehand and the preparation is all

2511
02:27:57,331 --> 02:27:58,320
consuming.

2512
02:27:58,620 --> 02:28:03,030
There's very few things in life that
are the like these big moments like a

2513
02:28:03,031 --> 02:28:08,031
person stepping into a cage for a fight
and the consequences are so grave.

2514
02:28:09,770 --> 02:28:12,930
It's just for your emotions,
for your physical health,

2515
02:28:12,931 --> 02:28:15,950
this is this really nothing like it.
Is it really the,

2516
02:28:15,951 --> 02:28:20,951
the to expect that you would
find something else similar
in life and to be able

2517
02:28:22,071 --> 02:28:26,960
to achieve a similar state
outside of that? It's, I don't,

2518
02:28:27,020 --> 02:28:32,020
I don't think you ever will because I
feel like part of what makes what you do

2519
02:28:32,750 --> 02:28:37,750
and what all fighters do so intense and
so incredibly enjoyable to watch is that

2520
02:28:38,271 --> 02:28:40,580
we all know how much is on the line.

2521
02:28:41,160 --> 02:28:44,850
I think. I believe I'm 100%
in agreeance with you there.

2522
02:28:44,851 --> 02:28:48,450
And I think race car
drivers and fighter pilots,

2523
02:28:48,930 --> 02:28:53,930
I think people like that also likely
experience that state of being as well.

2524
02:28:54,240 --> 02:28:57,900
Yeah, I'm sure. Yeah. Fighter
pilots. It has to be, you know,

2525
02:28:57,901 --> 02:28:59,190
fighter pilots apparently I was reading

2526
02:28:59,250 --> 02:29:02,970
some story about this,
about wife swapping. They,

2527
02:29:03,200 --> 02:29:04,310
that they uh,

2528
02:29:04,640 --> 02:29:09,470
they're more inclined to have a
polyamorous relationships. Really. Yeah.

2529
02:29:09,471 --> 02:29:14,471
And then the wife swap because the
idea was that they know that their life

2530
02:29:15,890 --> 02:29:19,220
easily could be wiped
out any day at any time.

2531
02:29:19,250 --> 02:29:20,720
And the the people they
care about the most,

2532
02:29:20,721 --> 02:29:24,710
their wife or their girlfriend that
they want other people to love them

2533
02:29:24,860 --> 02:29:26,150
cause they might not be there.

2534
02:29:27,200 --> 02:29:31,370
Interesting and that they would want the
people they care about the most loved

2535
02:29:31,390 --> 02:29:36,390
them because yeah they're thinking in
a altruistic fashion of doing what they

2536
02:29:37,161 --> 02:29:42,161
can I suppose to help this person that
they care so much about continue to find

2537
02:29:43,161 --> 02:29:46,070
joy in their life because of their,

2538
02:29:46,100 --> 02:29:50,750
their realization that what joy
they may be able to derive from them

2539
02:29:50,751 --> 02:29:54,800
specifically is, is always on a thin
line of not being there anymore.

2540
02:29:55,640 --> 02:29:58,370
That's fucking intense.
That you love someone so much.

2541
02:29:58,371 --> 02:30:00,020
You want other people to fuck
him cause he's not going to be,

2542
02:30:01,580 --> 02:30:06,360
how do I get on that list? Well it's
probably already on. You just got to ask

2543
02:30:07,930 --> 02:30:08,620
the,

2544
02:30:08,620 --> 02:30:13,620
which comes back to the one thing
that is I think poison in life,

2545
02:30:13,930 --> 02:30:18,640
which is to live a double life,
a grave, a a boring no risk,

2546
02:30:18,641 --> 02:30:22,960
10 or run, no thrills,
no challenge, no growth,

2547
02:30:22,961 --> 02:30:24,670
no knowledge,
no learning.

2548
02:30:25,060 --> 02:30:30,060
Just this stagnant bullshit life
that is so prevalent in our society.

2549
02:30:31,061 --> 02:30:35,140
I think it's one of the main problems
with our world is that we have set up

2550
02:30:35,141 --> 02:30:39,970
these really safe cities and
safe societies and cultures,

2551
02:30:39,971 --> 02:30:42,890
which is wonderful.
It's great, but also we,

2552
02:30:42,920 --> 02:30:46,820
we haven't given people the
discipline or the structure or the,

2553
02:30:47,470 --> 02:30:52,470
the like the framework for living a life
that's going to satisfy your needs in

2554
02:30:54,641 --> 02:30:56,080
terms of your biological needs.

2555
02:30:56,350 --> 02:31:00,550
Yeah. Psychological, this and
people start determining that.

2556
02:31:01,780 --> 02:31:04,600
Totally inane things are what
their needs are. You know,

2557
02:31:04,660 --> 02:31:06,160
they're difficult to acquire,
right?

2558
02:31:06,161 --> 02:31:08,510
Like you think of Ferrari's going
to make you happy, cause a Ferrari.

2559
02:31:08,511 --> 02:31:11,650
He's hard to get. Sure. Very look at
it. Like how much do you cost? Shit.

2560
02:31:11,651 --> 02:31:16,440
If I'm just had that man, I'd be bawling.
I'd be driving around Red Ferrari. Yeah.

2561
02:31:16,540 --> 02:31:20,220
Be balling. But then you get that
Ferrari like this is just a car. Yeah.

2562
02:31:20,540 --> 02:31:24,330
Like unless you just really love cars,
like you could love,

2563
02:31:24,450 --> 02:31:27,650
you know your Firebird and you appreciate
it from a mechanical standpoint.

2564
02:31:27,690 --> 02:31:29,670
You want to step back and look at it.
It's enjoyable.

2565
02:31:29,790 --> 02:31:32,700
But if you think that the fucking thing
is going to make you happy, you're crazy.

2566
02:31:32,730 --> 02:31:37,730
Not more happy than me being happy with
who I am as a person and the life that

2567
02:31:38,641 --> 02:31:42,980
I'm living. The Firebird can't do, can't
do that. There is no item. You know,

2568
02:31:43,020 --> 02:31:46,900
I have to sit back all the time
and try to think for myself that

2569
02:31:48,610 --> 02:31:50,090
you,
Ew,

2570
02:31:50,220 --> 02:31:53,430
I, I love my library, that I
have all the books within it.

2571
02:31:53,431 --> 02:31:56,280
I love the cars that I have.
I love the relationships that I have,

2572
02:31:56,281 --> 02:31:58,830
but there's a good written
instead of the relationship,

2573
02:31:58,831 --> 02:32:00,930
but just the things and it's
like these are all great things,

2574
02:32:02,680 --> 02:32:04,810
but if I don't have them,
I am still me.

2575
02:32:04,840 --> 02:32:08,410
I still have everything that
I need in this world. I,

2576
02:32:09,070 --> 02:32:12,640
I don't like to think about
them being lost, destroyed.

2577
02:32:12,641 --> 02:32:14,980
I certainly hate the idea of it being
destroyed because even if it wasn't in my

2578
02:32:14,981 --> 02:32:19,060
hands, I'd like them to still
exist for others. But without them,

2579
02:32:19,540 --> 02:32:22,030
I'm no different than who I am now.

2580
02:32:22,900 --> 02:32:26,140
And I guess that's kind of a
thinking of like the Stoics,

2581
02:32:26,660 --> 02:32:29,890
you've been more defined by your
accomplishments and your thinking and your

2582
02:32:29,891 --> 02:32:30,940
philosophy.

2583
02:32:31,030 --> 02:32:34,920
There's lots of things
that people obviously they
couldn't know about me. They,

2584
02:32:35,560 --> 02:32:40,560
because it's not the kind of
thing that is just my who I am.

2585
02:32:41,020 --> 02:32:41,700
Right.
And,

2586
02:32:41,700 --> 02:32:46,390
and I don't need someone to know whether
or not I'm smart or whether or not I

2587
02:32:46,391 --> 02:32:48,280
know this or whether or not I can do that.

2588
02:32:48,550 --> 02:32:53,110
It's like I'll do it when I need to do
it and I have to try and look to see that

2589
02:32:53,111 --> 02:32:57,190
I have my own inner peace is based on
my own self knowledge and knowledge also

2590
02:32:57,310 --> 02:33:01,900
that I am lacking, that I can
be better, that I, if I want to,

2591
02:33:01,901 --> 02:33:05,320
I can choose to. And those days that I
don't, it was a choice not to be better.

2592
02:33:05,500 --> 02:33:08,860
It wasn't that I couldn't cause even
going and failing like we talked about

2593
02:33:08,861 --> 02:33:13,330
before is a worthwhile endeavor because
it will move you towards either a

2594
02:33:13,331 --> 02:33:17,050
eventually getting there or B that it's
not something that's going to be yours,

2595
02:33:17,260 --> 02:33:19,600
but you know what it is and you
know what it takes to get there.

2596
02:33:20,350 --> 02:33:23,050
And that's a different
perspective altogether and

2597
02:33:24,620 --> 02:33:24,990
okay,

2598
02:33:24,990 --> 02:33:29,990
that is where I feel like that's where
I can be okay in this world and deal in,

2599
02:33:31,330 --> 02:33:31,820
in.

2600
02:33:31,820 --> 02:33:36,600
There's all kinds of things that you can
draw your focus and really eat at you

2601
02:33:36,601 --> 02:33:39,900
and bother you and you're giving weight
to these things and allowing them to

2602
02:33:39,901 --> 02:33:43,260
have an effect on you and that's natural.

2603
02:33:43,680 --> 02:33:47,620
That's a normal thing and it's
easy to fall into. But you,

2604
02:33:47,790 --> 02:33:50,160
if you can be okay with,
all right,

2605
02:33:51,030 --> 02:33:55,960
if all I'm left with is just me and what
I have, if I no longer have anything, no,

2606
02:33:55,970 --> 02:34:00,210
no more luxuries, no more this, no more
of that. Can you be okay with that?

2607
02:34:00,450 --> 02:34:02,040
You know,
what kind of life would you make of this?

2608
02:34:02,041 --> 02:34:06,810
And I like to think the same one I
have now. You can pick me up here,

2609
02:34:06,811 --> 02:34:10,410
take all my shit away,
throw me some other part of the world,

2610
02:34:10,411 --> 02:34:14,520
the third world country
and it will be jarring.

2611
02:34:14,700 --> 02:34:17,530
It will be difficult and there
will be some lament of course,

2612
02:34:17,560 --> 02:34:20,170
but I will continue to be who I am.

2613
02:34:20,200 --> 02:34:25,200
I will see what is necessary to to
communicate with others and to continue to

2614
02:34:26,590 --> 02:34:29,920
propagate this that I'm
trying to create in me.

2615
02:34:30,650 --> 02:34:30,981
Yeah.

2616
02:34:30,981 --> 02:34:34,190
I think we're all trying to navigate
this really incredibly difficult thing,

2617
02:34:34,191 --> 02:34:38,960
which is your, just your life. You're
the emotions, the, the, the, the,

2618
02:34:38,961 --> 02:34:42,140
your goals, your tasks,
your relationships, your,

2619
02:34:42,710 --> 02:34:44,360
your dreams and aspirations.

2620
02:34:44,361 --> 02:34:49,361
All these things are just so complicated
and the whole idea of not knowing what

2621
02:34:50,211 --> 02:34:52,760
the future holds is stressful,

2622
02:34:52,940 --> 02:34:56,480
but it's also incredibly rewarding when
things work out well and even when they

2623
02:34:56,481 --> 02:34:57,710
don't work out well.

2624
02:34:57,950 --> 02:35:02,360
What's rewarding about that is you get
the gift of knowing that you fucked up

2625
02:35:02,540 --> 02:35:07,070
and you get the gift of the feeling
of fucking up and the horrible,

2626
02:35:07,080 --> 02:35:07,790
just the,

2627
02:35:07,790 --> 02:35:12,080
the feeling of failure and to understand
that that's fuel for you to regroup,

2628
02:35:12,350 --> 02:35:14,420
repackage your fucking thoughts and,

2629
02:35:14,421 --> 02:35:19,421
and now move forward with the knowledge
of the mistakes that you've made and

2630
02:35:19,690 --> 02:35:20,780
you're going to be a better person.

2631
02:35:20,840 --> 02:35:25,530
How can you fuck up if you
don't do anything? If you
don't ever day, you don't. If,

2632
02:35:25,531 --> 02:35:29,150
if, if you just sit back and
you try to lead the simplest,

2633
02:35:29,330 --> 02:35:31,700
safest version of a life,
it's not a life.

2634
02:35:31,760 --> 02:35:35,240
It's on a line and it's not a life I can
really imagine that anyone can really

2635
02:35:35,241 --> 02:35:39,860
be truly fulfilled living.
And you know,

2636
02:35:39,861 --> 02:35:43,460
things are ultimately
incredibly soft on us. I mean,

2637
02:35:43,461 --> 02:35:45,860
we have pressures in other ways,

2638
02:35:45,920 --> 02:35:50,920
but ultimately most of us are living
quite comfortable lives with no immediate

2639
02:35:52,821 --> 02:35:53,870
dangers and no,

2640
02:35:54,950 --> 02:35:58,880
no real impetus to put stress on
ourselves where it doesn't exist at times.

2641
02:35:58,881 --> 02:36:01,070
Because let's just say you
wanted to learn new language.

2642
02:36:01,100 --> 02:36:03,800
There's agitation in terms of,

2643
02:36:03,860 --> 02:36:08,510
of forcing you to have to endure
something. There's some suffering in that.

2644
02:36:08,960 --> 02:36:11,510
And you know, I believe in the
Nietzschean concept of, you know,

2645
02:36:11,630 --> 02:36:14,360
suffering creates growth.
You know, life is suffering.

2646
02:36:14,690 --> 02:36:17,030
Suffering doesn't have to be catastrophic.

2647
02:36:17,031 --> 02:36:20,460
It doesn't have to be this
sort of thing that, um, is,

2648
02:36:20,500 --> 02:36:22,370
is going to debilitate you,

2649
02:36:22,460 --> 02:36:27,110
but that suffering is needed for you
to continue to become better. For sure.

2650
02:36:27,240 --> 02:36:29,790
Everything with exercise, with
learning, with everything,

2651
02:36:29,820 --> 02:36:33,420
with the even relationships, learning
in relationships that, that the,

2652
02:36:33,421 --> 02:36:36,450
all those uncomfortable
feelings are how you learn.

2653
02:36:36,480 --> 02:36:41,090
Yes. Learning relationships.
I, I've always said to two
friends of mine, you know,

2654
02:36:41,130 --> 02:36:44,490
the first time they have like a big
blow out with something called me up and

2655
02:36:44,940 --> 02:36:45,840
I'll fuck,
you know,

2656
02:36:45,841 --> 02:36:49,650
so and so said this and I don't know how
their Dick ended up there and all this

2657
02:36:49,651 --> 02:36:52,650
stuff. Just like look, ultimately, yeah,

2658
02:36:52,651 --> 02:36:54,540
no one wants to get
into a row with someone,

2659
02:36:54,541 --> 02:36:57,450
especially someone that you
really care about. But if,

2660
02:36:57,690 --> 02:36:59,370
if this is an important relationship,

2661
02:36:59,371 --> 02:37:03,990
the only way it becomes a relationship
that has that deeper lasting meaning and

2662
02:37:03,991 --> 02:37:08,250
that really has any real depth to it
at all is what you do when you guys are

2663
02:37:08,251 --> 02:37:11,820
faced with adversity that shows
you what relationship you have.

2664
02:37:11,850 --> 02:37:15,350
Because when things are fun and easy,
anybody can be a part of it, right?

2665
02:37:15,380 --> 02:37:15,980
We all just,
you

2666
02:37:15,980 --> 02:37:20,330
know, Hump in and drinking and going out
and woo, that's great. Fucking wonderful.

2667
02:37:20,331 --> 02:37:25,160
But when I'm, I'm good. Once he has a
pretty, it's not bad as a single guy,

2668
02:37:25,161 --> 02:37:28,640
I'm constantly looking for that
opportunity. But uh, ladies,

2669
02:37:28,880 --> 02:37:33,770
if you look in a hump and drink hump and
dragging that mainly whiskey in coffee,

2670
02:37:33,771 --> 02:37:37,580
but drinking and hopping and muscle
cars, if you're into that, uh,

2671
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:39,860
but when you get into these,

2672
02:37:40,010 --> 02:37:42,740
all of a sudden adversity
comes across your doorstep,

2673
02:37:44,060 --> 02:37:46,490
how you'd handle that.
And you know,

2674
02:37:46,910 --> 02:37:50,300
whether you're the person who brought it
or you're the person who's in enduring

2675
02:37:50,301 --> 02:37:52,370
it from the other side and,

2676
02:37:52,580 --> 02:37:55,070
and if you haven't experienced that in
your life and also in experience it in a

2677
02:37:55,071 --> 02:37:58,280
relationship, man, you might not be ready.
That's true. Might not have the tools.

2678
02:37:58,310 --> 02:38:01,730
Yeah. You need to know about everything
that you do. That's difficult. Right?

2679
02:38:01,731 --> 02:38:04,910
It gives you the tools to
navigate difficult situations
and the other aspects of

2680
02:38:04,911 --> 02:38:09,890
your life are agreed. Yeah. It is
the, the stresses of having to,

2681
02:38:09,940 --> 02:38:14,390
to deal with a problem and how you handle
that problem because there will never

2682
02:38:14,391 --> 02:38:18,230
be any shortage of, of problems, of
difficulties from, from great too small.

2683
02:38:18,770 --> 02:38:20,030
And you,

2684
02:38:20,240 --> 02:38:25,240
your way of mitigating those problems
and dealing with them is so important.

2685
02:38:26,890 --> 02:38:30,200
It's, it determines how it, how it works
out for you. That's right. Bitches.

2686
02:38:30,230 --> 02:38:35,030
Josh Barnett dropping knowledge, like
advertised. Let's wrap this up. Josh.

2687
02:38:35,350 --> 02:38:39,170
He's the man. We got to do this more
often. We do it like once a year now.

2688
02:38:39,230 --> 02:38:41,150
I would love to come in more often.
I,

2689
02:38:41,210 --> 02:38:43,760
I especially would love
to even at some point,

2690
02:38:43,761 --> 02:38:46,610
like when you've got Bret in here
and you've got Jordan and all that,

2691
02:38:46,620 --> 02:38:49,870
and I'm just want to sit in,
talk on philosophy like that.

2692
02:38:50,090 --> 02:38:53,300
I love the shit out of it. Let's do
it, Josh Barnett, ladies. Gentlemen,

2693
02:38:53,690 --> 02:38:54,350
bye everybody.
