1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:04,980
Rogan experience time,
but another one that I remember early on

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,300
early on,
John Jones,

3
00:00:06,301 --> 00:00:08,330
he wasn't anything bad.
It was for no,

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:13,320
maybe something like that.
I'm meeting them talking about shit and

5
00:00:13,321 --> 00:00:16,020
I could talk about this now because it's
not no longer a banned substance.

6
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:19,020
UFC,
but like a talking about weed.

7
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:20,280
Yeah.
And was like,

8
00:00:20,281 --> 00:00:21,330
yeah,
let's smoke bro.

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,500
He wasn't anything.
It wasn't anything and just going like,

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,271
he's like,
who's got wait?

11
00:00:26,271 --> 00:00:27,240
I'm like,
oh Rogan's got it.

12
00:00:27,241 --> 00:00:30,360
But he's in his hotel room and texting
you flip phone,

13
00:00:30,361 --> 00:00:34,980
texting you back when it wasn't cool to
have like hip to have a flip phone.

14
00:00:34,981 --> 00:00:36,180
What it was like,
that's all anybody had.

15
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:40,010
That's how long ago.
And then just go in like maybe it's that

16
00:00:40,011 --> 00:00:42,530
and maybe it was early a iphone,
but like just going,

17
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:43,950
hey man,
are you up?

18
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:44,821
And you're like,
yeah,

19
00:00:44,821 --> 00:00:45,420
I'm kind of tired.

20
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,040
Go to sleep.
And was like,

21
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,350
Fuck John.
I think he's doesn't want us up there.

22
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:50,450
And then be like,
no,

23
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:50,941
no,
let's go.

24
00:00:50,941 --> 00:00:51,900
He's got the weed.
Let's go.

25
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:53,850
Because some fan gave it to us,
right?

26
00:00:53,851 --> 00:00:57,340
You had this fucking tin,
tin foil of weed and um,

27
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:58,590
and just knock on your door and you're
like,

28
00:00:58,591 --> 00:00:59,790
what?
And you're like,

29
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,650
uh,
you retired?

30
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:02,920
And it was like,
um,

31
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:04,200
do you have that?
We'd like to come on,

32
00:01:04,201 --> 00:01:05,034
I want to go to sleep.
It's like,

33
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,030
man,
John want to smoke?

34
00:01:06,031 --> 00:01:07,020
And you're like,
you looked at us,

35
00:01:07,021 --> 00:01:09,750
you open the door fully looked at me and
this young fighter and you're like,

36
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,130
come on in.
And we all smoked pot together and this

37
00:01:14,131 --> 00:01:16,740
hotel room and fucking wherever it was,
I think Montreal,

38
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,620
Montreal.
And you're just a fun time.

39
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:23,670
And then seeing this guy move on to
become the baddest motherfucker on the

40
00:01:23,671 --> 00:01:24,100
planet.

41
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:27,690
But we also had a conversation with him
about I wanted him to go to a different

42
00:01:27,691 --> 00:01:28,710
camp.
That's right.

43
00:01:28,711 --> 00:01:33,120
He was training in fucking youtube
videos in New York with his buddies in a

44
00:01:33,121 --> 00:01:33,990
garage.
You too.

45
00:01:33,991 --> 00:01:34,771
Good.
I'm Mike.

46
00:01:34,771 --> 00:01:36,540
You should be in a real cash.
That's right.

47
00:01:36,541 --> 00:01:39,180
We had that over weed in that hotel
room.

48
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,230
He's like,
you really think so?

49
00:01:40,231 --> 00:01:40,771
I go,
I know.

50
00:01:40,771 --> 00:01:43,710
So I know you only have a certain amount
of time in this thing.

51
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:49,010
I go and your time should be invested
with a real coach who's going to hone

52
00:01:49,111 --> 00:01:50,040
your skills.
I go,

53
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:51,840
you can be an all time.
Great man.

54
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,400
Wow.
Yeah.

55
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:54,480
I remember telling him that and he's
like,

56
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:55,350
you really think so?
I go,

57
00:01:55,351 --> 00:01:56,370
I know.
So I know.

58
00:01:56,371 --> 00:01:58,020
So you,
you really got to move on.

59
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:01,020
I forgot about that part of it.
That how influential is out in the

60
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:04,080
fucking future of mixed martial arts.
I hope it helped.

61
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:08,240
I feel like I retain enough strength to
be good at what I need to.

62
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,480
So to burn yourself out.
I don't burn myself out,

63
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:14,150
you know,
because like the oldest people in the

64
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,990
world were an athlete,
you know,

65
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,980
and they're kind of people who didn't
burn themselves out too much.

66
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:22,370
So I,
my theory on longevity is like don't

67
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,890
overdo it.
I don't need to necessarily be

68
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,800
overtrained for what I do.
A lot of the skill.

69
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:31,100
A lot of the,
the winning that I do competitively is

70
00:02:31,101 --> 00:02:34,730
from a skill.
It's not so much from being super strong

71
00:02:34,731 --> 00:02:38,240
having crazy cardio.
It's making a choice about which wave,

72
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:41,660
how I'm gonna Approach and ride that
wave and I have to get two scores every

73
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:45,020
30 minutes when they compete.
So it's like I got this 30 minute window

74
00:02:45,021 --> 00:02:48,020
I need to be ready for.
I don't need to be like in crazy,

75
00:02:48,021 --> 00:02:49,120
crazy shape [inaudible].

76
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,440
So what is it that held other guys back
in the past?

77
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:56,450
I think there's a number of factors.
I think you have to naturally be really

78
00:02:56,451 --> 00:02:58,190
competitive.
Like in your,

79
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,650
when you were born,
your home,

80
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,440
somehow you had to,
maybe you needed something to prove.

81
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,453
You know,
I,

82
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:05,860
I was Kinda like,
you know,

83
00:03:05,861 --> 00:03:08,080
growing up I sort of looked back at it
and kind of laugh.

84
00:03:08,081 --> 00:03:11,860
Like I maybe I couldn't get the girl I
liked because she liked an older guy or

85
00:03:11,861 --> 00:03:12,880
you know,
I didn't have,

86
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:16,060
we didn't really have any money in my
family so I wanted to make some money.

87
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:18,190
I had an older brother who kind of
picked on me,

88
00:03:18,191 --> 00:03:20,890
but I hung out with him and played
football with his friends that were all

89
00:03:20,891 --> 00:03:22,840
three years older than me.
So I had to be strong,

90
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,250
you know,
I had to be tough and fast.

91
00:03:24,251 --> 00:03:26,650
I had to be smart.
That's the case with a lot of guys,

92
00:03:26,651 --> 00:03:29,110
older brothers,
they were brothers that they couldn't

93
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,180
really compete with them like this
motherfucker.

94
00:03:31,181 --> 00:03:33,370
And so every night we would just eat
away at the end.

95
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:36,280
I think it,
I think it did and there was always

96
00:03:36,281 --> 00:03:36,911
that,
you know,

97
00:03:36,911 --> 00:03:38,800
my brother and I have,
I think we have a pretty good

98
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:43,540
relationship now and I don't think he
would disagree with me that we kind of

99
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:47,320
didn't get along for 20 years or more.
We shouldn't hate each other.

100
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,520
It's a long time.

101
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,780
And then the other thing is about wally,
I hate trashing law but also kind of

102
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,690
loved trashing wildly,
uh,

103
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:59,780
is they have a lot of money to pay
celebrities to tweet ads for awhile way

104
00:04:01,171 --> 00:04:04,260
basically Gaga being one of them.
Right.

105
00:04:04,261 --> 00:04:06,130
And you heard this story,
uh,

106
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:11,100
so she's tweeted a bunch of wally ads
and I noticed that while she's a brand

107
00:04:11,101 --> 00:04:14,070
ambassador for awhile,
a tweeting ads about how much she loves

108
00:04:14,071 --> 00:04:17,910
her Huawei phone.
If you look in the details of the tweet,

109
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:22,740
it's always via twitter for iphone and
it's like whatever.

110
00:04:22,741 --> 00:04:23,910
She can use an iphone.
I don't care,

111
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,490
but I thought it was funny so I just
tweeted it.

112
00:04:25,491 --> 00:04:28,280
It's very funny.
It blew up and uh,

113
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:31,290
I had while way reach out to me like,
how did you find this?

114
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:33,240
How did you know,
where did you,

115
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:35,130
is this a mistake?
Like,

116
00:04:35,131 --> 00:04:36,600
could this be a pr?
Like,

117
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,370
has this ever malfunction?
I'm like,

118
00:04:38,371 --> 00:04:39,204
no,
this is,

119
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:41,580
that's how twitter works.
Like you can see the data.

120
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:44,430
It's clearly an iphone.
And I thought that was,

121
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,490
that's my screenshot.
And so,

122
00:04:47,491 --> 00:04:51,480
uh,
not only did Gaga Dope Bloch Gal Godot,

123
00:04:51,481 --> 00:04:53,190
the fucking wonder woman lady.
Yeah.

124
00:04:53,191 --> 00:04:56,550
Wonder woman,
wonder woman,

125
00:04:56,551 --> 00:05:00,240
you fucking fake from an iphone.
It's just funny because look at the

126
00:05:00,241 --> 00:05:03,750
picture of her lyrics.
She blocked you.

127
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:08,900
Not only did she blocked me,
but wowway since then has tweeted they

128
00:05:09,271 --> 00:05:12,420
deleted like her latest tweets and
repost them from an android phone and

129
00:05:12,421 --> 00:05:14,130
she's tweeted from android phone ever
since.

130
00:05:14,131 --> 00:05:15,410
I'll give her respect for that.
Well,

131
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:19,440
they probably told her you're gonna lose
all that cash is no way she's tweeting

132
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:20,820
like she has a team.
I get it,

133
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:24,120
but like whoever was on her team
tweeting from an iphone,

134
00:05:24,121 --> 00:05:27,810
like the fact that she blocked you.
Those hilarious.

135
00:05:27,811 --> 00:05:30,060
That's gross.
I thought it was really didn't do

136
00:05:30,061 --> 00:05:31,130
anything.
No,

137
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,450
I didn't.
I think I tagged her in and she probably

138
00:05:33,451 --> 00:05:36,090
was just getting barraged by like people
going,

139
00:05:36,091 --> 00:05:40,490
well you're using an APP like an iphone.
Like why I'm I think event.

140
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,000
It was like a year later she unblocked
me.

141
00:05:42,001 --> 00:05:44,550
It was really funny.
She unblocked me.

142
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:45,403
Thanks.
Go.

143
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:50,750
So he actually changed his position
slightly because when he ran for

144
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:53,310
president he said,
not only am I against marijuana being

145
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:56,370
illegal at a federal level,
I wouldn't even let the individual

146
00:05:56,371 --> 00:05:58,070
states decide whether or not

147
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,200
they want legal marijuana.
So in other words,

148
00:06:00,201 --> 00:06:03,620
he would prosecute the states like
Colorado and California that have legal

149
00:06:03,621 --> 00:06:07,280
marijuana using federal law.
And right there he softened his position

150
00:06:07,281 --> 00:06:08,420
slightly and he said,
well,

151
00:06:08,421 --> 00:06:09,920
leave it up to the states and let them
decide.

152
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,100
So anything that's because he knows
he'll never be president.

153
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:14,840
No,
I think he still wants to be president.

154
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,150
There's no fucking way.
I think he's gonna run again.

155
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:19,110
No,
I don't know if he's going to run in 20

156
00:06:19,111 --> 00:06:20,030
slash 20,
but 20,

157
00:06:20,031 --> 00:06:21,160
24.
No,

158
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:22,250
I'm serious.
First of all,

159
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,260
the uh,
the odds of that guy's going to make it

160
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:29,330
eight more years with that fair point.
Morbidly obese carcass.

161
00:06:29,331 --> 00:06:33,440
He's moving his hand around with it.
Need get a stapler.

162
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:36,820
Didn't he get his stomach fucking suit?
You know,

163
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:39,110
somebody pointed that out.
I didn't know that.

164
00:06:39,111 --> 00:06:40,370
I never saw those stories.

165
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:42,740
I'm not denying that it's true,
but I just never heard it.

166
00:06:42,741 --> 00:06:47,120
But if he did didn't work while I had a
friend who ate through two of those,

167
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:48,320
he,
he,

168
00:06:48,321 --> 00:06:49,154
uh,
when you're a d,

169
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,840
that's what I'm saying anyway,
about food.

170
00:06:50,841 --> 00:06:54,860
He's addicted to food that's like,
this is unquestionably,

171
00:06:54,861 --> 00:06:57,890
he's an addict.
Do you think nobody said that to him in

172
00:06:57,891 --> 00:06:58,760
his life or.
And I look,

173
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,510
look how much thinner he go.
Okay.

174
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,731
And he did this.
Oh,

175
00:07:01,731 --> 00:07:04,410
I guess he did this before the
presidential race because he wanted to

176
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,310
make it,
but then he got fat again.

177
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,030
Yeah.
So he was wrote ton before.

178
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:15,730
He was like a bag of water before and
then you know,

179
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,510
he,
he trimmed himself down.

180
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,090
Yeah.
And it's funny because I don't think in

181
00:07:20,091 --> 00:07:23,690
any way he realizes the hypocrisy of
having his own,

182
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,970
um,
you know,

183
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:27,260
issue with food and he would argue,
hey man,

184
00:07:27,261 --> 00:07:28,520
listen,
I'm going to eat what I want it to

185
00:07:28,521 --> 00:07:29,354
freedom choice.

186
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:32,390
But when it comes to freedom for
somebody to decide to tweak their

187
00:07:32,391 --> 00:07:34,190
consciousness slightly,
all of a sudden he says,

188
00:07:34,191 --> 00:07:35,420
you shouldn't be allowed to do that.
Well,

189
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:37,250
that's where it's preposterous.
The idea that,

190
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:40,970
you mean even with what he said about
alcohol didn't make any sense.

191
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:41,801
Like,
what'd you mean?

192
00:07:41,801 --> 00:07:43,250
The alcohol illegal,
what we try to read,

193
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,330
it's called prohibition.
Okay.

194
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:49,570
But let's pretend that you had some sort
of an ability to keep that from going

195
00:07:51,651 --> 00:07:52,550
sideways.
Again,

196
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,630
let's start from the beginning.
Would you want alcohol to be legal or

197
00:07:56,631 --> 00:07:58,370
not?
If you could wave your hand and and

198
00:07:58,371 --> 00:08:01,640
there would be no more problems that are
alcohol associated,

199
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:06,760
would you do that and make it illegal
versus give a grown adult the

200
00:08:08,271 --> 00:08:12,200
possibility of deciding whether or not
they want to drink or not drink?

201
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:14,300
Yeah.
He's not being consistent and his logic.

202
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:18,380
That's the point is that he's willing to
say I'm thinking about donuts,

203
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:21,140
but he even.
He even mentioned prohibition there,

204
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:22,880
but that makes my point,
not his point.

205
00:08:22,881 --> 00:08:24,590
Yes,
because that's when the mafia got

206
00:08:24,591 --> 00:08:28,580
incredibly powerful because you pushed
all the alcohol sales underground and

207
00:08:28,581 --> 00:08:31,470
they got all the power and the money as
a result of it and that's when crime is

208
00:08:31,471 --> 00:08:34,520
shot through the roof,
so if you want to decrease violent crime

209
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:37,540
and the drug war,
one of the most transformative

210
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,380
moments of my life was when I met spot
many in person,

211
00:08:41,381 --> 00:08:45,640
which is one of the legged robots in
Boston dynamics for the first time when

212
00:08:45,641 --> 00:08:50,590
I met them,
met that little fella there was.

213
00:08:50,591 --> 00:08:53,950
I know exactly how it works.
I know exactly how every aspect of it

214
00:08:53,951 --> 00:08:55,560
works.
It's just a dumb robot,

215
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:59,310
but when I met him and he got up and he
looked at me,

216
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:01,620
there it is right there.
Have you seen a dance now?

217
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,180
Yeah.
The dance.

218
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:08,760
The dance is crazy.
It's but see,

219
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:12,240
it's not crazy on the technical side.
It's engineered.

220
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,890
It's obvious.
It's programmed,

221
00:09:13,891 --> 00:09:15,840
but it's crazy to watch like,
wow,

222
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,790
there's something.
The reason that moment was

223
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:21,150
transformative because I know exactly
how it works and yet by watching it

224
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:24,120
something about the feeling of it,
you're like,

225
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:29,150
this thing is alive
and there was this terrifying moment.

226
00:09:29,281 --> 00:09:32,940
Not Terrifying,
terrifying and appealing where this is

227
00:09:32,941 --> 00:09:34,230
the future,
right?

228
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:39,680
Like this thing,
like this thing represents some future

229
00:09:40,861 --> 00:09:45,540
that is totally that we don't cannot
understand.

230
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:50,840
Just like a future in the 18th century
of a future with planes and smartphones

231
00:09:51,621 --> 00:09:54,180
was something you could understand that
this thing,

232
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,070
that little dog could have had a a human
consciousness in it.

233
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,310
That was the feeling I had and I know
exactly how it works.

234
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:04,110
There's nothing close to the
intelligence,

235
00:10:04,111 --> 00:10:09,111
but it just gives you this picture of
what the possibilities are of these

236
00:10:09,661 --> 00:10:12,780
living creatures and I think that's what
people feel when they see Boston

237
00:10:12,781 --> 00:10:15,870
dynamics will call awesome.
This thing running around is they don't

238
00:10:15,871 --> 00:10:18,510
care about the technicalities and how
far away we are.

239
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,040
They see it,
look,

240
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:24,570
this thing is pretty human and the
possibilities of human like things that

241
00:10:24,571 --> 00:10:29,571
supercede humans and can evolve and
learn so quickly,

242
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:35,300
exponentially fast is this terrifying
frontier that that really makes us think

243
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,240
as it did for me.

244
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:41,070
I'm sure a bull rider would look at free
soloing.

245
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:42,620
It'd be like,
what a crazy dude.

246
00:10:42,621 --> 00:10:44,090
You know,
everybody looks at another sport and

247
00:10:44,091 --> 00:10:44,751
they're like,
that's great,

248
00:10:44,751 --> 00:10:46,410
and honestly I look at fighting and I'm
like us,

249
00:10:46,411 --> 00:10:47,950
and he was totally outrageous.
I'm like,

250
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,570
why would you want some other dude beat
you to death in the cage?

251
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,000
I'm like,
that's crazy outrageous.

252
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:55,520
It is outrageous,
but if you can get good enough where you

253
00:10:55,521 --> 00:11:00,521
can avoid getting the knowledge and then
the tool to land the damage,

254
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,190
it's kind of the same.
But even landing the damage to a certain

255
00:11:04,191 --> 00:11:04,730
extent,
you're like,

256
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,200
oh,
you're hurting somebody else for the

257
00:11:06,201 --> 00:11:07,280
pleasure of the crowd.
You're like,

258
00:11:07,281 --> 00:11:09,290
that's Kinda messed up.
You know,

259
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:13,220
it's a very weird feeling.
Knocking someone out is one of the

260
00:11:13,221 --> 00:11:17,150
weirdest feelings because a part of you
is happy that it's not you,

261
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,040
but part of you is like looking down
with that guy that's just got flatlined

262
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,690
and you're like,
Whoa,

263
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,093
that could have been made.

264
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,590
And how much to fighters?
Like,

265
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:27,830
hold back,
you know,

266
00:11:27,831 --> 00:11:30,080
because I feel like you kind of have to
like go to the death,

267
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:33,020
but then if you actually like punch
somebody so hard they died or something.

268
00:11:33,021 --> 00:11:35,000
I mean obviously you'd feel horrible or
it will.

269
00:11:35,001 --> 00:11:37,370
You don't look back at all.
But that's what I'm saying.

270
00:11:37,371 --> 00:11:38,990
But.
So it's like you don't hold back at all,

271
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,700
but then if you actually killed
somebody,

272
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:44,240
wouldn't you feel horrible?
It's very rare that someone dies in

273
00:11:44,241 --> 00:11:45,680
mixed martial arts.
Believe it or not.

274
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:46,521
Well,
yeah.

275
00:11:46,521 --> 00:11:47,480
No,
I mean I know that,

276
00:11:47,481 --> 00:11:49,050
but it's possible.
Yeah,

277
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:51,440
definitely.
And it has happened and it's sort of

278
00:11:51,441 --> 00:11:55,870
like it has happened very,
very rarely in mixed martial arts.

279
00:11:55,871 --> 00:11:59,500
Never in the UFC,
but in boxing it happens more often and

280
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:02,410
one of the reasons why it happens more
often in boxing because you're only

281
00:12:02,411 --> 00:12:05,680
punching in mma,
you're taking people down.

282
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:07,660
People are tapping out because they're
paying weird grades.

283
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:08,201
Yeah.
Well,

284
00:12:08,201 --> 00:12:10,960
it's also there's more options to defend
yourself.

285
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,330
You're not just getting battered against
the ropes.

286
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:18,310
They're also nowadays much better at
stopping a fight when a fighter's

287
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:21,310
clearly compromised when they're.
They're really fucked up.

288
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,520
In the old days,
they used to let guys just get battered

289
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:27,720
box.
That doesn't sit well with me.

290
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:28,610
I'm just like,
ah,

291
00:12:28,611 --> 00:12:29,890
yeah,
but that's what I'm not a fighter.

292
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,370
Well,
that's the thing about climbing is

293
00:12:33,371 --> 00:12:37,240
there's this real elemental appeal to
just you and the mountain and it's

294
00:12:37,241 --> 00:12:40,150
nature and it's beautiful and it's very
peaceful and calm.

295
00:12:40,151 --> 00:12:43,160
It's like so different than having
thousands of people screaming at you as

296
00:12:43,161 --> 00:12:44,680
you punch someone in the face over and
over.

297
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,030
It was like,
dude,

298
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:51,280
that's just not.
My scene was like 2017.

299
00:12:51,281 --> 00:12:54,840
Halloween.
I was a 400 pound stretched to pass a

300
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:57,310
skeleton.
Oh my gosh.

301
00:12:57,311 --> 00:12:59,650
This fancy dress party in it.
I'm looking around and I'm thinking,

302
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:03,640
these are all young kids compared to me.
I'm 30 and I felt like I was the oldest

303
00:13:03,641 --> 00:13:05,080
guy in there like 29.
It was like,

304
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,880
why am I doing here?
He says,

305
00:13:06,881 --> 00:13:09,670
what you want for your life full of
yourself.

306
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:13,840
This is not me a number.
How many people told me before this

307
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,920
I was going wrong was doing.
You need to act out your life.

308
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,020
You can only change your life if you
want to change it.

309
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,850
And I left and everyone said,
are you going home early?

310
00:13:22,851 --> 00:13:23,684
He said,
yeah.

311
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:26,710
I left at 9:00.
I went home and I got back home.

312
00:13:26,711 --> 00:13:29,080
I didn't say anything to the Y,
but it went straight upstairs into a

313
00:13:29,081 --> 00:13:32,860
dark room
and I took the cheap,

314
00:13:32,861 --> 00:13:37,861
had skeleton suit off and I sat there
and I got on my knees and I was praying

315
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:41,420
and begging God to help me
know.

316
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:45,640
At this point I'd never.
I've never begged or cry to God to help

317
00:13:45,641 --> 00:13:48,070
maybe for her.
I prayed a lot all my life,

318
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,710
but I'd never been in this physical
state before.

319
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:53,230
I can feel tears running down my face.

320
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:57,910
My chest was wet with tears because I
knew I couldn't do it on my own.

321
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:03,310
It wasn't possible for me because I
tried and tried and tried and ended up

322
00:14:03,311 --> 00:14:05,020
back in Nepal,
back drinking.

323
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:09,160
I almost accepted that that was going to
be my fate and alcoholic.

324
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:13,430
So it was on my knees in his bedroom.
Um,

325
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:18,990
after praying for about 10 minutes,
I got up and I felt the weight of the

326
00:14:19,421 --> 00:14:24,421
world was lifted off my shoulders.
And for the first time in years I knew

327
00:14:25,811 --> 00:14:27,970
it was going to make a comeback.
And I called.

328
00:14:27,971 --> 00:14:29,140
My wife has said Paris,
Paris.

329
00:14:29,141 --> 00:14:29,860
She said,
well,

330
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,480
she followed was drunk coming home from
the pope.

331
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:35,680
I said,
Monday morning I started to regain

332
00:14:35,681 --> 00:14:37,990
mission to try and get the heavyweight
championship of the world book.

333
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,131
She said,
yeah,

334
00:14:39,131 --> 00:14:39,850
yeah,
yeah,

335
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:42,700
because before this,
every time I'd have a beer,

336
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:45,160
I'd come back and I'm going to be the
heavyweight champion of the world again,

337
00:14:45,161 --> 00:14:46,900
because it was.
It was the alcohol talking,

338
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:52,220
so I was like the money called Wolf a
thousand on this.

339
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:57,400
This sheep had Korea to that.
I was living on the past thinking about

340
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:00,990
years before glory days and after this
prayer.

341
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:01,810
Opposite,
right?

342
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:03,740
This has got to be.
She didn't believe me one second,

343
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,930
but even when I speak to her now,
she says,

344
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:08,060
that night you told me that.
She said a year and a difference,

345
00:15:08,061 --> 00:15:10,250
and you've always swimming cap on.
