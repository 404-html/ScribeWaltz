00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:10,650
Two one and we're live. Hello
Gabby. Hello. How are you doing?

2
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:13,140
Good, thanks for being here. I
appreciate it. Thank you for having me.

3
00:00:13,141 --> 00:00:15,400
You're looking well, thank
you. You are as well. I uh,

4
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:16,890
I really enjoy following you on Instagram.

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,490
You have a very positive Instagram page.
It's full of information.

6
00:00:20,491 --> 00:00:22,080
It's beneficial.
It's great stuff.

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,830
Thanks. I, uh, you know, I'm, I feel
like I'm trying to figure that out.

8
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:30,250
Like for a younger person it's like,
oh yeah, well this is how you do it.

9
00:00:30,251 --> 00:00:33,700
And for me I'm like, well what do you
really want to say? And I don't know.

10
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:37,180
I think sometimes I,
I would like to take more chances,

11
00:00:37,181 --> 00:00:40,140
but I do play it probably
safe. How so? Like in what way?

12
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,240
I try to be pretty honest,

13
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:48,270
but sometimes you're always very aware
that you'd just amount interested in

14
00:00:48,401 --> 00:00:52,420
getting roasted or spending a
lot of time and energy in a,

15
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,860
a hassle with somebody. So I think when
I'm doing it, I'm as honest as I can be,

16
00:00:56,861 --> 00:01:00,310
but it's also, I'm aware of
that. What do you hold back on?

17
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:01,240
Like what kind of stuff?

18
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:05,630
I think for me it would just,

19
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:09,680
maybe you'd just be more even maybe
more direct, but you're, you know,

20
00:01:09,681 --> 00:01:13,100
I think when you're trying,
when you sort of say, okay,

21
00:01:13,101 --> 00:01:17,240
I'm going to occupy this space
professionally, that feels good to me.

22
00:01:17,241 --> 00:01:21,050
And like I want it to be
overall pretty positive.

23
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:23,450
You know?
Like if you're selling something,

24
00:01:23,451 --> 00:01:25,400
like maybe I'd like to try
to sell something positive,

25
00:01:25,401 --> 00:01:28,100
but hopefully towards
the honest a little bit.

26
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:31,580
And sometimes when you're doing that,

27
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:36,910
you're also aware that like you're not
as harsh as sometimes your inner voices.

28
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:39,201
And so you go,
well,

29
00:01:39,201 --> 00:01:42,800
am I not being completely honest and
transparent because I don't really want to

30
00:01:42,801 --> 00:01:46,730
deal with it and I, so I'm just saying,
you don't want to deal with feedback.

31
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:51,470
Comments. Yeah. And it's, and it's also
just people who are frustrated or, or,

32
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,940
or also they're not getting maybe the
nuance or the subtlety of what I'm trying

33
00:01:55,941 --> 00:01:58,430
to say. Let's just say that
social media is not the place for

34
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,820
subtlety. No, not in the comments
for sure. Right, right. So I just,

35
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,050
I want to do stuff that seems like that
seems authentic. You know, pretty real,

36
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:12,320
but hopefully skewed towards like
either fun or something positive.

37
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,770
Mm. One of things that I've recognized
from doing a podcast is the, uh,

38
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,230
some of the frustration when
people do lash out and you're like,

39
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,590
this is like out of proportion.

40
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:26,790
Some of it is due to the fact that it's
very frustrating to just not be a part

41
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:29,070
of the conversation if you disagree with,

42
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:32,310
when you're listening to
just the fundamental, the,

43
00:02:32,311 --> 00:02:36,660
there's the act of listening to someone
have a conversation and something comes

44
00:02:36,661 --> 00:02:39,930
up and you're like, but what about
that? That's a great point. Say that.

45
00:02:39,931 --> 00:02:42,910
And it's like this, you get
stuck. Yeah. It's get angry.

46
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:46,050
So then we leave it a shitty comment.
I'm like, oh, that guy's a dick.

47
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:49,500
But it's point, his frustration
of not being able to communicate,

48
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:53,610
interject. It's like your kid
who'd be like, hey, hey, hey.
And they never get to in.

49
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,790
Yeah.
That's a great point.

50
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:59,820
I think you've probably been tempered by
doing this and have probably looked at

51
00:03:00,341 --> 00:03:04,270
it from a lot of different points of view
because you have to, yeah. You have to.

52
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:05,950
I've tried. No, it's,

53
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:09,400
it's been interesting to like
watch you over the years.

54
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:14,790
I think what's interesting is watching
you have an interesting place where you

55
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,260
keep your own,

56
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,860
you sort of keep a level of neutrality
even though you have an opinion.

57
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:23,530
So you let other people
express themselves,

58
00:03:23,531 --> 00:03:27,900
whether it's about a religion
or a vaccination or whatever.
I think that that I,

59
00:03:27,901 --> 00:03:31,750
it's been interesting to see like
you develop that skill even more.

60
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:36,910
Well, it's hard for people to
express themselves as it is.

61
00:03:36,911 --> 00:03:38,740
Like live on a podcast is difficult.

62
00:03:38,741 --> 00:03:42,070
It's harder still if you don't
allow them to. If you interject,

63
00:03:42,071 --> 00:03:44,650
and you know as well as we
all know that when someone,

64
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,260
when you have something you're trying
to say and someone talks over you,

65
00:03:47,261 --> 00:03:48,670
it's fucking frustrating.

66
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:52,150
And when you trying to formulate these
words than someone butts in and then you

67
00:03:52,151 --> 00:03:54,040
lose it,
it's hard.

68
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:57,920
So that's one of the key
skills of learning how to
communicate with people that

69
00:03:57,921 --> 00:04:00,760
we think a lot of people lose is
the ability to listen. You know?

70
00:04:00,761 --> 00:04:03,760
And also you have to have a good enough
memory so you can hold on what you were

71
00:04:03,761 --> 00:04:08,050
going to say and then allow this person
to elaborate on their thoughts and then

72
00:04:08,051 --> 00:04:12,160
when you give them the respect and allow
them to elaborate on your thoughts,

73
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:16,000
hopefully they'll return that favor and
they'll allow you to elaborate on your

74
00:04:16,001 --> 00:04:18,400
thoughts and then you'd get a
much more balanced conversation.

75
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:22,420
But there's so many people talking where
they're just talking over each other

76
00:04:22,421 --> 00:04:26,800
and shutting each other down or taking
the conversation into a weird place.

77
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:32,110
It's just I'm the only way to find out
how someone feels about something is to

78
00:04:32,111 --> 00:04:36,430
let them express themselves and if
people get mad that I don't push back,

79
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:39,880
that's not always the best way
to find out how a person feels.

80
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,540
You got to let them let them talk.
I want to know,

81
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:45,490
I want to know the whole thing.

82
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,520
I want to know as far into this as
you can tell me why you think this.

83
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:53,410
Like instead of me just saying,
no, you're wrong. I want to,

84
00:04:53,411 --> 00:04:54,910
I want you to explain it to me.

85
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,310
I want to know whether or
not I trust your process.

86
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:01,610
Do you bring that scale home with you?
I mean, you're surrounded by women.

87
00:05:01,611 --> 00:05:05,830
It's trough. It's tough, bro. I,
I, I'm serious. Like sometimes I,

88
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:09,440
cause I even see it with my own husband.
We have three daughters,

89
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,890
but I mean, especially, you know,

90
00:05:12,891 --> 00:05:15,020
when you have a pretty masculine male,

91
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:19,670
I'm always fascinated to
watch them navigate their
home when they're surrounded

92
00:05:19,671 --> 00:05:20,280
by women.

93
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:25,140
I just give up. Most of the
time I lose every argument. Um,

94
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:29,880
I think, um, you know, I tried to,
we communicate a lot, lot of talking,

95
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:34,200
a lot of get upset with girls.

96
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:37,980
It's always there always things they're
crying about and you're like, okay, okay,

97
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:42,180
okay, we're going to be fine. And you
know, I don't want them to be like me.

98
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:44,490
I want them to be themselves
and I want them to be girls.

99
00:05:44,491 --> 00:05:45,990
I want them to be able to be themselves.

100
00:05:45,991 --> 00:05:49,090
I don't want them to mirror my resilience,
you know,

101
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:53,340
I want them to be vulnerable if they
want to be vulnerable. But it's a,

102
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:57,940
in terms of like how I decorate the
house or any, I don't have no say, oh no.

103
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:02,450
That's why you have, you know, I have this
place. I was going to say, you have your,

104
00:06:02,451 --> 00:06:05,910
your cave here at Laird has a
barn. Perfect. And He, you know,

105
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,600
when he meets young guys getting married,
he goes, here, I'm going to teach you.

106
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:12,200
Okay. You're right honey.
I'm sorry. And Oh yes.

107
00:06:12,201 --> 00:06:16,280
Whatever color you choose,
you know, always work. Some
people it's never enough,

108
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,190
but if all that is the
right relationships,

109
00:06:18,191 --> 00:06:21,110
sometimes it'll work that way because
I don't give a fuck what my house looks

110
00:06:21,111 --> 00:06:24,790
like. I really don't know. I have a
good view. Where's the coffee? Yeah,

111
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:30,620
real work. How's the bed? That's a good
bed. Do we have a TV? Where's the TV?

112
00:06:30,621 --> 00:06:33,440
Is it a good one? Lots of good TV.
All right, we're good. We're good.

113
00:06:33,441 --> 00:06:37,570
I have a laptop. Okay. We're good. Yeah.
Yeah. I don't need that much. You know,

114
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,340
so like when my wife's like, I want to put
this here, I'm like, okay, put it there.

115
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:43,520
Fantastic. I want to get that painting.
Okay. Get the painting. I don't know.

116
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:46,160
I don't know where you want to put it.
Put it where it feels right.

117
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:49,460
I don't give a fuck. I
think it's smart. I mean,

118
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,980
you know like sometimes if I am fringe on,

119
00:06:51,981 --> 00:06:55,310
if it's functional then layered steps
in like you know that's not really

120
00:06:55,311 --> 00:06:58,100
functional,
but otherwise he's like,

121
00:06:58,101 --> 00:07:01,040
I'm tearing some stuff out of my house
right now and he just gives me a look and

122
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:05,300
I'm like,
I'm this age if I want to do this,

123
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:09,680
support me. And he just laughs and walks
out. He just probably doesn't care.

124
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:13,790
It's in the way. Whatever it is,
whatever, have fun with it. Yeah.

125
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:17,690
What Time's dinner? You know,
and love to decorate things.

126
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,380
I get nervous if a guy's really into
it. Well yeah, it's a nesting track.

127
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:26,690
Guys are like really into like
the design in their own house.

128
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:28,790
Like really,
really into it.

129
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:32,020
Like constantly obsessing about where
things are and where I supposed to call

130
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:36,170
those homosexuals. Yeah. I can't
plow. Yeah. What do you mean?

131
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,950
Is that a stereotypical thing? That
is outrageous. What? He's not racist.

132
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:43,460
That might be,
he might have showed you white supremacy.

133
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:50,480
Yeah. It's a funny thing. Right. But,
uh, if I didn't have this place though,

134
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:51,390
I don't know if I,

135
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:55,250
like traditionally men had pool halls
they could hang out at or gyms that they

136
00:07:55,251 --> 00:07:59,120
would hang out in and they would
get their dose of toxic masculinity.

137
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,730
Her basement basement.
Yeah.

138
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:04,080
You kind of take you to a place where
nobody's touching your stuff. Yeah.

139
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:08,530
Well if you live in a house, like
I do with all girls too. It's,

140
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:13,370
it's just everything's girly. I just,
whatever. I'm fine. [inaudible] said he,

141
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,620
he's like,
I need it to be more specific.

142
00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:17,540
I said I want it to be
surrounded by women.

143
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,170
I didn't mean to be
related to all of them.

144
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,310
That's hilarious. It's, I think it's
a nature, God's way of balancing off.

145
00:08:28,311 --> 00:08:32,780
They say if guys have elevated
body temperature, so athletes,

146
00:08:32,781 --> 00:08:36,980
people train a lot that
they're statistically have
a greater chance of having

147
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,830
daughters because I think they hot,

148
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:44,930
we call it hot balls basically,
if he kills off the male
sperm. That's hilarious.

149
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,830
And if you look around, I think so
they did a thing on a bunch of guys,

150
00:08:48,831 --> 00:08:49,930
either in the NFL or whatever.

151
00:08:49,931 --> 00:08:51,980
And statistically they just
have a lot more daughters.

152
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,230
And I think it's like
nature's way of going, oh,

153
00:08:55,231 --> 00:08:59,370
you're going to be all like moving
and active and raw and all this stuff.

154
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:00,653
Guess what?

155
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:05,020
They're just going to put a bunch
of girls around you for you.

156
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:09,450
Because my daughters say things to my
husband. I could never say as a wife,

157
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:13,380
you know, it's like I see
it and I just go, oh yeah,

158
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:17,730
well they know that for sure. He loves
them. So they carried away with it.

159
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,000
They're in, they can't get fired.
No, I always say that to them.

160
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,680
My youngest daughter, when she was really
little, like five or six, she'd say, okay,

161
00:09:25,681 --> 00:09:30,450
so I'm not really clear with
this. Um, when I have alone time,

162
00:09:30,451 --> 00:09:34,650
I'm by myself. And when you and dad
need alone time, like you're together.

163
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,390
And I tried to like,
well you know,

164
00:09:36,391 --> 00:09:38,880
it's important for moms and dads cause
you know, we have to work at it. I go,

165
00:09:38,881 --> 00:09:42,270
you know, you're, you're always going
to be dad's daughter. I, you know, I'm,

166
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,950
we're working at being a husband and
wife and a then she'd keep going with it.

167
00:09:46,951 --> 00:09:48,780
And um, I finally, it
would just say like, Hey,

168
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,060
do you want to have
Christmas in separate houses?

169
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:54,990
And I'd see her thing for a second, like,
well, maybe, you know, and I'm like,

170
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:59,400
we need a long time. I get to
present. That's what I mean,

171
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:02,910
she's processing that. She's like,
I miss you, but I dunno. You know,

172
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:07,890
so it's all that dance, you
know, cause daughters, man,

173
00:10:07,891 --> 00:10:11,250
they don't miss a trick and they're
on you and they're on their dad like

174
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,880
nobody's business. While my friends
would have sons, the way they say it is,

175
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,710
it's like you take one of two things.

176
00:10:16,711 --> 00:10:20,370
Either you have this wild animal that's
tearing things apart or you have someone

177
00:10:20,371 --> 00:10:22,960
who's screaming and crying about
something you don't understand. Yeah.

178
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:27,150
Take your pick. You want until judo
mental destroyer or a physical destroyer.

179
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:32,310
Yeah. Walls with holes and broken,
broken bones. Boys and girls.

180
00:10:32,311 --> 00:10:36,390
It's like I have learned so much
being a mother, two daughters,

181
00:10:36,391 --> 00:10:37,680
and I've been around women my whole life.

182
00:10:37,681 --> 00:10:40,260
You figure playing volleyball
and being around tons of women,

183
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:43,260
it's very different as a parent.
I mean I've learned the most,

184
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:47,520
especially teenagers.
They're watching them grow so strange.

185
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,350
It's such a strange experience watching
a person figure out the world from,

186
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:56,010
from jump, you know, like out
the womb, figuring out the world.

187
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:00,210
It's so educational.
I feel.

188
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,010
I don't think everyone
should have children.

189
00:11:02,011 --> 00:11:03,780
I'm not one of those zealots
that tells everybody, Hey,

190
00:11:03,781 --> 00:11:05,340
you're not alive until you have a kid.
No,

191
00:11:05,341 --> 00:11:07,170
I think it's unfair to say that to people.
That's unfair.

192
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,280
I think it's first of all,

193
00:11:08,281 --> 00:11:12,660
a lot of people can't write and maybe
they have a just a different path.

194
00:11:12,661 --> 00:11:13,890
Like I always tell my girlfriends too,

195
00:11:13,891 --> 00:11:18,891
like it's unfair also to romanticize
like to your friends who either opted not

196
00:11:19,441 --> 00:11:23,370
to have children or whatever, met a
partner too late or didn't or whatever.

197
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,620
Because I think it is a really rich,
I mean there's nothing like it.

198
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:31,650
I mean, I love my children,
but if I have one friend,

199
00:11:31,651 --> 00:11:34,620
she was like got married later and she's
like, you know, we're going to adopt.

200
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:40,050
And um, she was also doing a new business
and I was like, listen, I need to come,

201
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:43,920
I want to talk to you. And she also liked
to consider taking naps occasionally.

202
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:44,671
I was like,

203
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:48,060
if you think you're going to adopt and
like you're going to have a 12 year old

204
00:11:48,061 --> 00:11:50,820
that's like a, hey, I really appreciate
you guys. Thank you so much. I go,

205
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:54,160
that's not what you know, like if
you think you're going to have a kid

206
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,580
and it's gonna make you happier,
that's not what having a kid is.

207
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,290
I think it makes you,

208
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:04,860
it makes you know yourself better in a
different way and you can adapt and do

209
00:12:05,981 --> 00:12:09,280
something different. But I think when
people sort of sell that bill of goods,

210
00:12:09,281 --> 00:12:12,780
like, oh, you got to have kids. It's like,
well, do you want to have kids? You know,

211
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,440
I think it's like you said, not for
everyone. You definitely shouldn't adopt.

212
00:12:16,441 --> 00:12:18,640
You think it's going to be easy.
That's what I mean.

213
00:12:18,641 --> 00:12:22,300
It's like she had this romantic idea
of like, and I go, you know, you don't,

214
00:12:22,301 --> 00:12:25,390
first of all, you don't know what the,
what's where the kid is coming from.

215
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,670
And then also you have a romance.

216
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:31,540
I think every parent going into
it has a romantic idea. I did.

217
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:33,760
And I'm a pretty realistic person of like,

218
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:37,510
I'm going to do all these things right
and it, we're going to be, you know,

219
00:12:37,511 --> 00:12:41,350
running in sunflower fields together
and my kids are never going to think my

220
00:12:41,351 --> 00:12:45,760
music sucks or I can drive. And then
you realize, I had a friend tell me,

221
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:50,010
everyone gets their turn in the
barrel no matter what you do. Uh,

222
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:52,870
you got, you have to navigate
stuff you're going to,

223
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:55,790
to deal with stuff for sure.
And on the other hand,

224
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,630
it's awesome when someone does adopt
people, if they're really into it,

225
00:12:58,631 --> 00:13:01,370
if they know what they're getting into
and those martyrs out there and those

226
00:13:01,371 --> 00:13:06,170
people that are just super kind and
generous and love to adopt children of God

227
00:13:06,171 --> 00:13:08,840
bless them. So glad
they're there. It's just,

228
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:13,100
I agree with you that there are some
people that have a romanticized idea of

229
00:13:13,101 --> 00:13:15,320
what it's like to raise
a child and it's unfair

230
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:18,080
to to sell it. Like, I
loved the mom check what?

231
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:21,230
So when are you going to have number two
or whatever to somebody it's like, oh,

232
00:13:21,231 --> 00:13:24,140
you know that they're behind
closed doors doing, you know,

233
00:13:24,141 --> 00:13:27,290
like they just want everyone to be
in the psychotic ness with them.

234
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,960
I have three kids. You should
have three kids. You know,

235
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:33,380
there are people like
that, right? They did this.

236
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,170
People that have a kid then immediately
take this moral high ground.

237
00:13:36,171 --> 00:13:39,260
Like so like they're doing something,
they're an adult and you're,

238
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,590
you're just a fool. You're
layer. I wonder who is the fool?

239
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:45,980
I ask myself that sometimes.
Well,

240
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,210
don't you think you're a better
person for raising kids? Do you,

241
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:54,280
does it make you feel like you're more
in tune and nicer and just more aware of

242
00:13:55,491 --> 00:13:57,050
what it is,
what it means to be a human?

243
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:01,300
Yeah. I not only that I, I feel like,

244
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:06,550
I feel like it's,
it's a forced exploration.

245
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:10,960
If you're trying to participate, like if
you just lay down the law and go, hey,

246
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:14,830
in this house, this is how we do
it, then you're not doing anything.

247
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:16,630
But I think if you,

248
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,860
you learn to adapt and also go,
wow,

249
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:24,790
I was doing that wrong for like 10
years. Amazing. You know, like I've,

250
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:25,680
one of my daughters,

251
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:31,300
I had 12 or 13 sort of revealed some
stuff about what she was unhappy about,

252
00:14:31,301 --> 00:14:34,690
about my parenting, and I was like, God,
I've been doing that for a long time.

253
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,650
Uh, so I think it's cool that she
had the confidence to do that though.

254
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,710
Yeah. It's so cool. I wanted to hear that.

255
00:14:44,711 --> 00:14:49,330
Like when she was 30 at the Thanksgiving
table, she moved out. I was like,

256
00:14:49,331 --> 00:14:53,240
what? You're supposed to reveal all that
like after you move out and then I go,

257
00:14:53,241 --> 00:14:57,920
oh, what did I do that? Sorry. It
turned out great. It's amazing.

258
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:03,860
What time's your flight? Uh,
no, I think, no, listen, it's a,

259
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,910
it's a surrender. I think for me
it's been a real surrender because I,

260
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,530
I just think I, you think you're in
control of stuff and you think, oh,

261
00:15:12,531 --> 00:15:14,150
I've got some discipline and work ethic.

262
00:15:14,151 --> 00:15:17,690
I just work my way through it
or power my way through it.

263
00:15:17,691 --> 00:15:21,570
And then you realize like, no,
you have to surrender. And,

264
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:25,970
and also it's not just about
solving it quickly and, um,

265
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:30,110
yeah, it is. I'm, I know
myself certainly better,

266
00:15:30,111 --> 00:15:34,870
but also it forces you if you're
willing to, to really expand and it's,

267
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:37,250
it is uncomfortable.
Well,

268
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:41,630
I've been really fascinated by the
life that you guys live in Hawaii

269
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,910
because I've always had this
like idealized, like one day,

270
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:50,180
like moved to the big island,
just chat on the side of a mountain,

271
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:52,580
stop fucking out,
fly out to do gigs,

272
00:15:52,581 --> 00:15:56,380
but live out there where
everything's just more relaxed. Yeah.

273
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,820
Know is it okay?
You know,

274
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:03,920
there's a lot going on and like the Big
island is obviously big city. Yeah, no,

275
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:07,910
it's been a while. It has, it's
sort of like la on the beach,

276
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,320
but you know,

277
00:16:09,321 --> 00:16:12,620
there's a couple things I think because
it is a primal environment like we live

278
00:16:12,621 --> 00:16:16,490
on quite, which is pretty
heavy duty as far as, um,

279
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:19,340
it's quiet.
There's not a lot of distraction.

280
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:23,810
There's a really heavy duty nature.
And um,

281
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:29,540
and so I, and I grew up in, in
St Thomas on the Virgin Islands,

282
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:33,260
so I was used to kind of being
on an island. But it, you're,

283
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:38,510
you're with yourself a lot,
so if you have things to do that are,

284
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:42,560
you know, productive,
then it's perfect. Um,

285
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:45,750
but what you have to always
calibrate is like, um,

286
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,230
the downtime or it like,

287
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:52,550
it's been raining off and on for like
over a year on Hawaii. Whoa. Yeah.

288
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:55,820
So after a while it'd be like
Seattle in that way where people,

289
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:59,120
it starts getting heavy, but
it's sunny too, right? It can be,

290
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,990
and it's the weirdest thing
about the islands. Yeah.

291
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:04,910
There's different climates on this island.

292
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,730
The Big island has desert.
Yes,

293
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:12,390
it has tropical rain forest is a volcano.
There's all this shit in a snack.

294
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:17,120
Every, I think it has
every, uh, weather climate,

295
00:17:17,121 --> 00:17:18,410
except Arctic,

296
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:23,620
I believe at least Maui and the big
island have sort of every type of climate.

297
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,840
It's crazy that just a little bit
further down. It'll be different.

298
00:17:26,841 --> 00:17:29,090
It'd be raining constantly. Yeah, exactly.

299
00:17:29,091 --> 00:17:30,980
Or You just go the other
side and it's completely dry.

300
00:17:30,981 --> 00:17:33,830
Or they have dwarf trees because they
never see the sun, but then they're,

301
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:38,360
you know, 200 feet in the
places that it's sunny. It's,

302
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,380
it's pretty trippy.

303
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:42,260
And you could drive around the whole
thing and like how many hours does it take

304
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:44,750
you to drive on the Big Island?
The Big Island? I don't know,

305
00:17:44,751 --> 00:17:48,950
like four hours or something like that?
I think so. Maybe a little more. Yeah.

306
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:52,590
You like the big island. Love it.
Interesting. I like Maui. You do?

307
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:54,930
That's my favorite. Every
island different. They're all,

308
00:17:54,931 --> 00:17:57,360
their personalities are
different, but I like it. I mean,

309
00:17:57,361 --> 00:18:00,450
we've been doing this for over 23 years.
When I met Laird,

310
00:18:00,451 --> 00:18:03,540
he was big waves sort of come in winter.

311
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:07,440
So when low pressures brings snow,
like to the rest of the mainland,

312
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:11,730
that low pressure can also bring big
waves. And then my season was summer,

313
00:18:11,731 --> 00:18:13,590
so we sort of went back and forth.

314
00:18:13,591 --> 00:18:17,040
And that's a really good blend because
then you can come to California and be

315
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:21,870
like, oh, it's a busy world. I can see
a lot of people. I can learn stuff,

316
00:18:21,871 --> 00:18:23,850
I can do stuff.
Um,

317
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:27,610
and then I also makes you appreciate
when you go back to Hawaii,

318
00:18:27,611 --> 00:18:31,380
you're like clean air,
really clean water,

319
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:34,710
very beautiful place.
Um, some of the ways,

320
00:18:34,711 --> 00:18:39,030
the ideas about the way they live
there, it's, it's simple in a good way.

321
00:18:39,031 --> 00:18:42,540
I don't mean that in any
way, like a derogatory, it's
like they're not trying to,

322
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:45,920
they're not angling and
trying to get somewhere. It's
like, no, we're living right.

323
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:51,030
Um, but it can be also a very, a
really hard place. Really hard place.

324
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:57,060
Well, I think, you know, and you're also
talking about a warrior culture, right?

325
00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:01,080
Polynesians.
So you have like this,

326
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:05,760
this very intense love. And, uh, you know,

327
00:19:05,761 --> 00:19:09,930
when they talk about the Aloha
spirit generosity, they ha like this.

328
00:19:09,931 --> 00:19:12,390
And then they're very
powerful people as well.

329
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:15,050
And sometimes if they're living,

330
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:18,870
not living as they're in their most
natural way that they were supposed to,

331
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:22,710
and then you couple it with, um, you know,

332
00:19:22,711 --> 00:19:25,950
there's not a ton of opportunities there.
It's hard to live there. It's far away.

333
00:19:25,951 --> 00:19:30,330
It's expensive. Um, and,
and sometimes, uh, you know,

334
00:19:30,331 --> 00:19:31,200
it sounds Cliche,

335
00:19:31,201 --> 00:19:36,180
but it's like we really do as human
organisms either need to be busy,

336
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:39,180
so like, okay, working from
sunup to sundown for our food,

337
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,210
which is how it used to be,
and then you're just so tired,

338
00:19:41,211 --> 00:19:44,010
you just go to bed and it's pretty
simple and let's just survive it.

339
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:46,320
Or in the world that we live in now,
it's like,

340
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:51,450
how do we get people doing things that are
kind of productive? And, um, you think,

341
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,020
oh, I just would sit on the beach and
look at the mountain. And it's like, yeah.

342
00:19:54,021 --> 00:19:56,820
And after a while you get bored.
And if you're a warrior,

343
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,990
you're either gonna go, you
know, do something with that.

344
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:05,950
That is good for you or
you might not. So, um,

345
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,940
I think there's, there's a
lot, a lot of that there,

346
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:12,540
I've learned a lot from that
culture. Um, but I mean,

347
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:17,340
they're pretty powerful.
They're powerful group and, uh,

348
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:23,130
you know, it can go the other way
pretty quick where it's, you know,

349
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:28,170
if there's drugs and alcohol are
beefing and like it's all that.

350
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:30,240
So it's,
that was really disturbing.

351
00:20:30,241 --> 00:20:33,480
I found out how much drug abuse there
is on some of the islands. Yeah.

352
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,720
Crystal Mathis especially
sad. Well it's, it's, again,

353
00:20:36,721 --> 00:20:38,940
it goes back to the board and like
thinking about when your kids have to stay

354
00:20:38,941 --> 00:20:42,870
home for one day. Yeah. You know,
it's just, and now we have all these,

355
00:20:42,871 --> 00:20:45,540
the internet and all this stuff,
so now you, you sort of think, oh,

356
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:49,690
the rest of the world has a perfect,
they're all busy and doing fabulous,

357
00:20:49,691 --> 00:20:53,290
perfect things. And um, and it's hard.

358
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:57,040
Like you got to find people
that you're like, let's do
something. Let's go. I mean,

359
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:59,530
can you train alone every single time now?

360
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,770
So you'd have to have a tribe
of people that are like,

361
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:08,020
let's go do this activity. And sometimes
they don't. It's not that easy. Well,

362
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,060
so there's, there's just
say there's 70,000 people on
the island on [inaudible].

363
00:21:12,061 --> 00:21:16,000
He's probably the least, uh,
inhabited, it's the oldest island,

364
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:20,200
so it has the most erosion,
largest beaches. Um,

365
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,350
and that's where Larry grew
up. And it's a, it's a,

366
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:28,270
it's a really denies the loose inhabitant
of the islands, isn't it? Well, yeah.

367
00:21:28,271 --> 00:21:32,200
I mean I don't, it's not that
I don't count it. Yeah. I
mean, of the bigger islands.

368
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:36,130
Yeah. Molokai, man, you wouldn't, you
don't, you don't mess with Malkai. No, no.

369
00:21:36,131 --> 00:21:38,240
That's like,
that's like you,

370
00:21:38,241 --> 00:21:42,040
but you got to ask permission to go
hang out over there. I'll Kinda, yeah,

371
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:45,550
it's cool though, cause it's like, if, you
know, if they'd be like, no, you gotta,

372
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:50,320
you can't, you're out. You got to
go. Really. Totally. So it was great.

373
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:54,010
Is it's just the people that live there,
you can't like move to Mollica. Yeah.

374
00:21:54,011 --> 00:21:57,610
I mean like, you know, I had, Eddie
Vedder has a place on Molokai. Yep.

375
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,350
And has had for many,
many years,

376
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:04,060
but I think he probably asked if that
was going to be cool. Oh Wow. Yeah.

377
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:06,730
Interesting. Yeah, it's,
and it's beautiful.

378
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:08,740
Do you have some friends that
just went hunting there? Yeah.

379
00:22:08,741 --> 00:22:12,820
Beautiful access to here. Yeah. Yeah.

380
00:22:12,821 --> 00:22:16,690
It's a beautiful place and the people are
amazing, but you, you, it's not like, oh,

381
00:22:16,691 --> 00:22:20,320
I'm just going to buy a house there or
build a house. There's no way. No Way.

382
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,340
No Way. Wow, that's interesting to do.

383
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:26,500
All these different islands have
their own rules. Well, Niki out is a,

384
00:22:26,501 --> 00:22:31,240
you can't even, you can't go there. No,
I didn't even know that was a, an island.

385
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:35,900
Yeah, it's off of cooperating
Nikki. I'll give her that.

386
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,230
Jamie's big fan of,
he looks like he's mentally,

387
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,730
he has none of that. It's all
like, they probably have the,

388
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,700
uh, the, you know, the largest
percentage of pure of Hawaiians there.

389
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:53,140
So it's cool. I mean, pretty
good. It's got to be a great view.

390
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:56,940
I've found that like, there's a
big difference between the, the,

391
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,190
the culture of say Maui
versus the culture of Lanai.

392
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,310
Lanai is more island d to me,

393
00:23:03,311 --> 00:23:06,790
whereas Maui seems like little
bit gentrified. We'll also,

394
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:09,010
the wind cause it Maui,
so windy,

395
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:12,350
it brought all the Europeans
in the 80s to wind surf.

396
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,880
So you're also have not only mainland
us and then Japanese culture,

397
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:23,830
you know, eighties now you're talking
about Europeans for wind and wind surfing.

398
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:26,980
So it has a lot going on.
I think Maui,

399
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:31,060
it was almost like a surprise how quick
it developed and they never had a chance

400
00:23:31,061 --> 00:23:34,890
to get on top of it, if that makes
sense. That does make sense. Yeah.

401
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:38,550
It's so populated and
it's also like, so, um,

402
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:42,880
it's so la Beverly Hills, I lived
there for 13 years with layered. Yeah.

403
00:23:42,881 --> 00:23:46,130
There was a wave there that Laird was
having a love with for many years.

404
00:23:46,131 --> 00:23:48,200
So we lived there, uh, with, you know,

405
00:23:48,201 --> 00:23:51,020
so he could be close to his
girlfriend for sure. It was strange.

406
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:54,230
It didn't know every boy needs is their
girlfriend. Every boy needs a wave.

407
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:56,450
They do. Well girl, you
know, just something,

408
00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:01,750
that's what I always think is kind of
natural is at least for my experience is

409
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:05,540
like,
I don't know if he ever go through this.

410
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:10,541
When you go home I'll Laerdal
go out and surf for many hours,

411
00:24:10,581 --> 00:24:14,210
like kicking off for five hours at a
time and if their surf and he comes home

412
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:18,980
and I see how happy he is, like to see us,
like he loves us. He's like, oh my girls,

413
00:24:18,981 --> 00:24:22,820
you know. And then about, I dunno,
seven and a half, eight minutes in,

414
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:27,080
he starts to get this look
on his face like, oh yeah,

415
00:24:27,081 --> 00:24:30,440
I'm in the house with the family.
You know,

416
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:35,090
I want it to do a book years ago called
death by domestication because it's like

417
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:40,130
how does, how does, how does he manage
both of those sides? Like, I need to go,

418
00:24:40,131 --> 00:24:42,100
I need to be free, I need to, you know,

419
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:46,310
chase things and like scare myself
and do all this stuff and then,

420
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:51,380
you know, comes home and he's like, you
know, on the floor laying, you know,

421
00:24:51,381 --> 00:24:52,630
with one of my daughters and,

422
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:55,460
and being attentive and a great
husband and all these things.

423
00:24:55,461 --> 00:24:57,530
But I always get amused
a little bit by the,

424
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:03,250
yeah, well especially I think
with the big wave surfer mindset,

425
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,760
like a type of person,
those are like some of the freest,

426
00:25:06,761 --> 00:25:08,440
wild as humans on the planet.

427
00:25:08,441 --> 00:25:13,441
It's a very unusual group of people that
rides giant waves of water on the top

428
00:25:14,651 --> 00:25:15,880
of the ocean.
I mean that's a,

429
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,600
that's a crazy thing to delta here
time to really stop and think about it.

430
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:24,560
I try not to think too much about
it cause I did marry him, but I,

431
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:28,390
there's some stuff, I mean
and, and weirdly, you know,

432
00:25:28,391 --> 00:25:31,210
he's been doing this so
long that you realize hit,

433
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:36,070
he's actually even more different than
some of the other guys because if you

434
00:25:36,071 --> 00:25:40,600
think about it, he sustained doing
this for right now, 40 years.

435
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:45,910
So he's a guy who
he has both.

436
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:49,210
So what he wants to do is write a huge
wave during the day and then be with his

437
00:25:49,211 --> 00:25:50,800
family at night. And sometimes, you know,

438
00:25:50,801 --> 00:25:53,680
it would take going halfway
around the globe or whatever.

439
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:59,160
And so I think the pursuit
and they have to wait a lot.

440
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:04,630
That's the other thing. These things don't
come around that often. Right? Um, it's,

441
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:08,860
it's very interesting to
live with because, um,

442
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,090
there's a,

443
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:13,270
there's a little bit of suffering that
goes on and sometimes layer it will say

444
00:26:13,271 --> 00:26:15,820
to me, cause he's aware of
time going by, he'll be like,

445
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:18,430
you don't have a lot more waves. I
need to ride. And I'm like, I know,

446
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:23,440
like it's a pretty deep,
uh, calling. And now that,

447
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:25,270
I mean he's been foiling for 25 years,

448
00:26:25,271 --> 00:26:27,700
but now that they are getting
that equipment better,

449
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:31,570
it's sort of like now we can ride
places that we couldn't ride,

450
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,770
that we're not really attractive for
riding on top of the surface of the water,

451
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:40,510
even if you towed it. So now it's
opened up a whole other pursuit for him.

452
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:44,910
Um, yeah, it's very, I know
why you would go towards that.

453
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:50,070
Like Laird has put me on a ski in front
of a way that's like 60 feet. Right?

454
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,820
And like being on the back
of a ski with him driving,

455
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:56,790
there's a moment where
you go, okay, I actually,

456
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,640
and I'm sure you've experienced this
with other friends that take you maybe on

457
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:04,680
up flying or something. He is, this
is what he does, right? So I'm like,

458
00:27:04,681 --> 00:27:08,280
okay, I trust him more than
I'm afraid. That's fine.

459
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:10,530
I can do that and I'm
going to surrender to that.

460
00:27:10,531 --> 00:27:13,470
I'm not going to torture myself the
whole time. I'm just going to trust him.

461
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:17,340
And you turn and there's a six
story building behind you moving

462
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:22,930
and you just think, who would,
who like, well how has that fun,

463
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:23,921
you know,

464
00:27:23,921 --> 00:27:28,921
like how is hang like I'm
going to actively ride that.

465
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:33,570
But now what the foils,

466
00:27:33,571 --> 00:27:36,300
because they're actually catching the
energy below the surface of the water.

467
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:40,140
So foils, I'm not familiar. They have
these things called the hydrofoils.

468
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:44,160
So originally there was a guy named Mike
Murphy who created something called the

469
00:27:44,161 --> 00:27:48,480
air chair. And they were, they'd been
putting foils on skis, water skis,

470
00:27:48,481 --> 00:27:49,890
and different funky ways.

471
00:27:49,891 --> 00:27:53,480
Like even in the 50s so layeredness
friends got an air chair,

472
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:58,550
cut the chair off and put
us snowboard boots bindings,

473
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:02,640
quick release. So you'd stand on
it. You're booted in and below.

474
00:28:02,641 --> 00:28:07,470
Is this basically a mini airplane
with a Strut? So for example,

475
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:10,860
yeah, there's a shot of one and
this is a smaller one. Jamie,

476
00:28:10,861 --> 00:28:12,770
do you have any ones of the
big with the boots? Yeah,

477
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,930
Larry. This is what people are
using the old time memories.

478
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:20,700
Do you know what about this? I seen
him. Wow. He knows about everything.

479
00:28:20,701 --> 00:28:23,550
What are you talking about? He's
plugged in, plugged in, look at them.

480
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:29,790
Do you have a girlfriend? Well, what
happened to this dude's head? Oh yeah.

481
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,050
So there's layered on the left obviously.

482
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,500
So you see how he there
in the boots and also he,

483
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:39,970
the reason it looks so puffy as he
has flotation underneath his wet suit.

484
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:41,890
So if you hit your head or what have you,

485
00:28:41,891 --> 00:28:46,780
but it's basically a miniature
airplane underneath the surface.

486
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:51,310
And if he gets into trouble, if they
wiped out, um, they have a quick release,

487
00:28:51,311 --> 00:28:55,830
but now they've gotten this
developed so that he can do it, uh,

488
00:28:56,740 --> 00:29:00,790
without the boots because that adds
an element of danger that cause you're

489
00:29:00,791 --> 00:29:04,360
strapped in, you're strapped
in and your strut is, you know,

490
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:09,190
four feet long. Uh, you know,
that's so strange looking.

491
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:13,450
Yeah. But it's what's going on below the
surface. So there's a miniature airplane.

492
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:15,970
Do you have, Jamie, do you have
any pictures of it flipped up?

493
00:29:15,971 --> 00:29:18,130
I'm sure if you look on Laird stuff,
you can see the bottom,

494
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:21,550
it's like a miniature airplane
because water is denser than air.

495
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:24,100
So it's sort of like a miniature plane.

496
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:29,260
And it is like the oracle guys that do
those boats do have made foils for Laird.

497
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,270
Um, it's, so that's what
it looks like. Yeah.

498
00:29:31,271 --> 00:29:35,650
So those are kind of more
a low performance ones.

499
00:29:35,651 --> 00:29:40,060
When you see the high performance,
they, I mean, you know,

500
00:29:40,061 --> 00:29:43,120
it's aerodynamics.
It's all of that.

501
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:48,250
So now what you're doing is because w
there's energy below the surface moving.

502
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:52,630
So we think of a wave like pushing and
dropping. But there's actually the energy,

503
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:55,740
circular energy below. So now you've
got the foil that can ride that and,

504
00:29:55,741 --> 00:29:59,440
but you're not, you don't have
drag. So like they can go,

505
00:29:59,441 --> 00:30:03,610
there's a wave on [inaudible] where
they're going over, you know, 50,

506
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:06,490
they go about 50,
they can go get up to 52 miles an hour.

507
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:12,430
So imagine if you did something, we'll,
you've dedicated yourself to martial arts.

508
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:16,120
It's like,
but then there's like a new way to do it.

509
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,540
And so he's been doing the
big stuff for 25 years,

510
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:21,310
but now they're using the equipment right.

511
00:30:21,311 --> 00:30:25,180
That he can ride ways that
actually wouldn't be that great.

512
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:28,500
But now they're super fun.
Oh Wow. So he gets it,

513
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:32,500
makes them excited and he still
pursues it. And, uh, that's,

514
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:36,160
that's on why right there and see how
it's not even breaking where he rides it

515
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:39,340
so it can correct.
And it's,

516
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:43,660
it's actually riding the energy
below the surface, which,

517
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:48,850
you know, for him, he's just interested
in what's the most efficient way. I mean,

518
00:30:48,851 --> 00:30:52,900
look at that. You'd never
enter in, um, regular surfing.

519
00:30:52,901 --> 00:30:55,660
Be able to ride that.

520
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:01,870
So it enables them so much fun.
You're flying, that's what they say.

521
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:05,860
That's the difference. Right? So
they're flying. So that's, I think,

522
00:31:05,861 --> 00:31:09,190
keep kept him interested.
But you know, his,

523
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:12,220
his pursuit of this is,
it's pretty,

524
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:17,440
it's pretty, it's a pretty
interesting relationship to watch.

525
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:21,730
I think it's important. I
mean, as a female for me,

526
00:31:21,731 --> 00:31:26,110
I think playing volleyball
helped me understand like
having a pursuit, you know,

527
00:31:26,111 --> 00:31:28,930
like something like I got to go do that.

528
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:33,100
And I think it's something about living
with a person who has a pursuit other

529
00:31:33,101 --> 00:31:37,990
than, um, like I need a
bigger war chest or whatever.

530
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:42,490
That's can be really cool is when,

531
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:47,640
when you're riding that thing and there's
the little airplane under the water,

532
00:31:47,641 --> 00:31:51,620
is there any risk of something
thinking that airplane is a fish? Um,

533
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:56,710
no. Animals are pretty smart.
Yeah. I don't, I think, I mean,

534
00:31:56,711 --> 00:32:01,150
I know sharks don't have great vision
and I think Laird is, uh, you know,

535
00:32:01,151 --> 00:32:03,940
hit a home, a turtle, you know,

536
00:32:03,941 --> 00:32:07,060
not done eating by like
grazed did or something.

537
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,950
But those animals are pretty smart.
Well, but I was thinking the sharks now.

538
00:32:11,951 --> 00:32:16,790
That's what I mean. I go maybe a
Marlin who thinks it's fish? Yeah,

539
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,900
I don't think, I don't think they want
to have anything to do with that thing.

540
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:22,960
Just the speed and the shape.

541
00:32:22,961 --> 00:32:26,260
And also a lot of those animals
don't want to get in that turbulent.

542
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:31,390
It's still near a wave.
But you know what maybe you never know.

543
00:32:31,391 --> 00:32:33,580
And if I hear of a story I
will definitely call you.

544
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:37,750
Tell him cause I'll be like a Marlin
came out. But those guys are smart.

545
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,890
All those animals, you
know, lens or smart.

546
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:43,580
Well I mean they not usually,
I know sharks again don't have great site,

547
00:32:43,581 --> 00:32:45,470
but they're not like,
Huh.

548
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:50,030
I think they understand
what's most times what's food.

549
00:32:50,031 --> 00:32:52,310
Obviously shiny things
and things like that. But,

550
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,640
but there are instances of people
getting hit by sharks, right.

551
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,470
In Hawaii is a big one,
isn't it?

552
00:32:57,910 --> 00:33:02,910
Thing you're swim worse as far as like
more and South Africa is really a lot of

553
00:33:03,441 --> 00:33:06,110
sharks. No, Hawaii has
their fair share, but

554
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:10,510
nothing crazy.
I,

555
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:13,400
there's a story that happened like three
weeks ago on quiet and Hanalei Bay,

556
00:33:13,401 --> 00:33:16,100
the sky great surfer finishes his ride,

557
00:33:16,101 --> 00:33:19,910
jumps off his board and jumped
onto a shark. Oh, Jesus Christ.

558
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:24,470
And the shark like turned I guess
and sort of he was a firefighter,

559
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:27,890
this guy and like grazed
his leg and split.

560
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:32,810
And I think it's just the reminder that
sharks ultimately really don't want to

561
00:33:32,811 --> 00:33:34,250
have anything to do with you.
I mean,

562
00:33:34,251 --> 00:33:37,130
maybe hammerheads maybe a little more
aggressive. Bull Shark is the most,

563
00:33:37,131 --> 00:33:40,910
because I think right, they have the most
amount of testosterone of any animal.

564
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:44,090
They're the ones that can go to the
fresh water too. Yeah. The bowls.

565
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:48,800
So they're sort of more
actively aggressive, but I
mean, I don't think a shark,

566
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:52,220
you're not good eating. I watched
the television show. They took, uh,

567
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,490
they found bull sharks
way up to Illinois River.

568
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:59,720
That'd be scaring whatever river it is
in Illinois. I don't know what Rivard is,

569
00:33:59,721 --> 00:34:01,970
but they found him deepened freshwater.
Yeah.

570
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:04,970
These sharks make their way
all the way from the ocean.

571
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:07,420
And then Jamie d see anything
about the testosterone.

572
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,910
I think of any animal they
have the largest amount of
testosterone or something

573
00:34:10,911 --> 00:34:12,710
like that. They're mean little
fuckers. Yeah, they are.

574
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,620
They're responsible for that.
Um,

575
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:19,660
the actual news incident that influenced
the creation of the movie jaws.

576
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:24,620
Oh really? Yeah. It happened in
the river in New Jersey, in Jersey.

577
00:34:24,621 --> 00:34:26,900
Can imagine a river
like a freshwater river.

578
00:34:26,901 --> 00:34:31,640
These people are getting
murdered by sharps look. Yeah.
Really? I didn't know that.

579
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,640
Yeah,
that's what it was based on the,

580
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:37,820
they didn't know that these fuckers can
swim way up into fresh water and they

581
00:34:37,821 --> 00:34:41,570
just got ahold of the people got Ahold
of a few people because those buggers are

582
00:34:41,571 --> 00:34:44,510
more, a little more aggressive.
Yeah. There's supposed to
be the most aggressive.

583
00:34:44,511 --> 00:34:47,930
Right? Yeah. But I think, you
know, for me with the sharks,

584
00:34:47,931 --> 00:34:51,210
like even jaws impacted me with
that soundtrack and I was living in,

585
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:54,890
in the Caribbean and it's a psych,
I dunno,

586
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:58,310
my kids that whenever my one daughter's
like, oh, can I get this movie on sharks?

587
00:34:58,311 --> 00:35:03,030
I'm like, no, cause we live in Hawaii.
He can't be watching that stuff. Yeah.

588
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:07,550
Chuck Testosterone. Mythbusting oh,
it is scientific American. Yeah. Oh,

589
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:11,870
it's not real? No. Okay. Sound good
though. It did, didn't it? Yeah.

590
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:14,660
Much more likely to you. I'm
a bull shark, you know? Yeah.

591
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:19,300
But a tiger shark would son even
meaner? [inaudible] no. Wow.

592
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:23,120
Pools meaner than tires. Yeah. They
say Bolin hammer or more aggressive.

593
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:26,210
Then tiger layered in.
My daughter reached,

594
00:35:26,211 --> 00:35:29,810
just went to do you know Mike
Mueller at all photographers sheets.

595
00:35:29,811 --> 00:35:33,390
A sharks. I know who he is. Okay. He's,

596
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,260
he does amazing stuff,
but they go and they dive.

597
00:35:36,261 --> 00:35:37,980
So he took a Reese and layered and they

598
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:42,730
went for like four days and they go in
the cage with the great whites out at the

599
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:47,280
Galapagos and they said, it's pretty
far out. You should do that sometime.

600
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:52,050
Fuck that. Commodity markets,
man fucks up the cage.

601
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:55,680
People probably doing stupid
things. No stooping. No.

602
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:59,430
He'll do things like we're guys
hit each other in the head,

603
00:35:59,431 --> 00:36:01,800
but you won't go sit in a cage.
And it seems normal to me.

604
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,090
They said that once you see him under
that, you have a different feeling though.

605
00:36:06,091 --> 00:36:08,790
Like you're not, it's not that
you're not as scared, but you,

606
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:14,380
you just see them a little differently.
Not just like a Predator, uh,

607
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:17,130
learning as you can see the pupil there,
I and everything.

608
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:18,560
Did you hear the Canada?

609
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:24,050
They're banning whale and dolphin
captivity. I think it's great.

610
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:28,290
I think it's great too, but it apparently
just passed. I mean, how about blackfish?

611
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:31,730
One documentary and it like kind of,

612
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:34,310
I think initiated a
movement. Oh, for sure. Yeah.

613
00:36:34,311 --> 00:36:37,940
People didn't know they needed to do
you just see it in a digestible form

614
00:36:37,941 --> 00:36:42,230
instead of having to go seek it out and
read articles about it and news reports

615
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:45,740
instead of that, they get to see it. There
it is in a very digestible format. Go,

616
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,400
oh my God, this is chaos. This is
horrible. This is it. This is an atrocity.

617
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:52,670
You're taking these incredible animals
that are probably some of the most

618
00:36:52,671 --> 00:36:57,050
magnificent creatures that evolution has
ever created and you're putting them in

619
00:36:57,051 --> 00:36:59,780
a fish tank.
You're putting them in a swimming pool.

620
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:03,800
There's their fins gold blend. Yeah.
That's crazy. Well, it actually,

621
00:37:03,801 --> 00:37:06,080
if you think about the killer whale,
I mean that's,

622
00:37:06,081 --> 00:37:11,081
the cane does a crazy video that I just
watched yesterday of one killing a beach

623
00:37:11,451 --> 00:37:12,284
seal.

624
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:16,520
It injured the seal and the seal tried
to make it over into and it literally

625
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:19,350
beached itself smash this seal on.

626
00:37:19,351 --> 00:37:22,670
There was just blood everywhere and these
a bunch of people were standing around

627
00:37:22,671 --> 00:37:24,890
watching and going,
Holy Shit,

628
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:28,160
and then it flopped it's way
back into the water and swam off

629
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:32,020
it. Did it eat it? Yeah. Okay,
well that's what I mean. Listen,

630
00:37:32,021 --> 00:37:33,370
that's the thing about
nature, right? It's,

631
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:38,090
it's kind of brutal but it's not
personal like the see the, the,

632
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,560
you know the whales not like, you know,
that seal gave me kind of a funny look.

633
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,380
I want to go and give it to him.
It's like, oh there's some food.

634
00:37:44,381 --> 00:37:47,140
Did you ever see them one when
they're on the iceberg and they look,

635
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:49,900
oh that bugger is still holding
on and they push it again,

636
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:54,410
calves at a hunt to mark
that she was setting it up,

637
00:37:54,411 --> 00:37:58,730
like showing like you can make them
slide like watch. This will slide well.

638
00:37:58,731 --> 00:38:02,030
I was listening to my friend
Steve Ronell's podcast and
he was talking about the

639
00:38:02,031 --> 00:38:06,410
difference in the orcas in the Puget
sound and that their local orchestras,

640
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:08,930
which are, uh, essentially, uh,

641
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,530
salmon specialists and
they don't eat animals,

642
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:14,330
they don't eat marine mammals.

643
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:19,540
But then there are other ones that
travel into the area and they are marine

644
00:38:19,641 --> 00:38:24,050
mammals specialists. So they, all
they eat is like seals and, and uh,

645
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:27,110
and things along those lines. And they
have a totally different language.

646
00:38:27,111 --> 00:38:30,350
Totally don't understand each other. They
don't interact with each other at the,

647
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:35,680
every pod has its own language.
It's crazy.

648
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:36,430
They,

649
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:40,900
they put up a whale in captivity once
and it was not eating because they didn't

650
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:43,420
know it was a seal eating well,

651
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:47,830
not a fish eating well and so learned,
I used to joke, can you imagine like,

652
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:51,340
okay, Suzy and Billy, we're
going to go watch the, you know,

653
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:55,570
the Orca Shamu and then the trainers,
they're like throwing at seal.

654
00:38:55,571 --> 00:38:58,840
Like that would not work out well.
Like, Yay. Do that trick again.

655
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:03,070
Give it a slab of cute little
animal. Yeah, no, so it's a,

656
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:05,980
they're very complex. Yeah. Well it's,

657
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:10,730
if it didn't exist, it would be way more
interesting than big foot. Yeah. Right.

658
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:13,900
Everybody's like so into
big foot being real. Yeah.

659
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:16,870
Got It. I don't get big for it.
Can you talk to me about that?

660
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:21,520
Like do you think what, what is,
what's the concept of big foot?

661
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:25,150
I mean, I know, okay. It's
a big hairy guy, but yeah.
Well, I mean really come on.

662
00:39:25,151 --> 00:39:25,984
What is it

663
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:31,060
most likely there was interaction between
human beings and something called the

664
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:35,210
Gi Canto Pythagoras for
thousands and thousands of years.

665
00:39:35,211 --> 00:39:40,211
It's a giant bipedal hominid that it
existed in Asia that was between eight and

666
00:39:40,731 --> 00:39:42,530
10 feet tall.
It was real.

667
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:46,640
And it was basically in like
the Orangutang family looks
almost orangutang like,

668
00:39:46,641 --> 00:39:49,100
but enormous. And that
was a real thing. Okay.

669
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:52,940
And they didn't find out about this until
like the 1920s they found a tooth in

670
00:39:52,941 --> 00:39:57,680
an apothecary shop and China and a,
and anthropologists examine this tooth.

671
00:39:57,681 --> 00:39:59,510
It was like,
where the fuck did you get this?

672
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:03,260
And they took him to the site and
they dug out more things and bones and

673
00:40:03,261 --> 00:40:05,780
jawbones and they
determined from the job on,

674
00:40:05,781 --> 00:40:07,670
I'm sorry if I'm fucking
any of this sub scientists,

675
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:10,760
but they determined from the job
on that they think it was bipedal,

676
00:40:10,761 --> 00:40:14,420
that it stood up on two legs
and so then they said, well,

677
00:40:14,421 --> 00:40:17,010
how big would this thing be?
And then in the proportionate,

678
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:20,790
yeah, like the fields. Are you ever seen
one? A real one looks like? Yeah. I just,

679
00:40:20,791 --> 00:40:23,610
sometimes I, when they say like,
oh up in Michigan, I'm like,

680
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,260
is it really like what are they seeing?

681
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:26,290
Bullshit.

682
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:30,310
Most of it is the people seeing shadows
in the trees and they want to believe

683
00:40:30,311 --> 00:40:33,100
it's big foot and they're seeing
bears that are walking on two legs.

684
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:35,260
But if there was a thing,

685
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:38,770
what's really interesting is that's
where it would be because if it did come

686
00:40:38,771 --> 00:40:43,240
across the larynx, the Bering land
bridge, like they believe humans did.

687
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:48,190
If that did happen, the many animals
Maton navigated from there to here.

688
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:49,083
That way.

689
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:53,490
That's where Alaska and
the Pacific northwest,

690
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,030
that would be the natural path.

691
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:58,400
And then if you think about how
densely wooded that area is, right,

692
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:01,720
that would be a natural habitat for
something that's hiding from people.

693
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:05,680
The problem is you can only hide from
shit anymore. It's just too hard.

694
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:10,330
They'd see from space something
would catch you on a trail camera.

695
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:13,540
Some, there's trail cameras that
are everywhere. They're fork like,

696
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:14,583
did you see those?

697
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:20,190
These a guy and his father got caught
poaching a mother bear in her den.

698
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:24,220
It's ill,
it's horrific,

699
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:27,550
it's horrible and it's not
just horrible because they,

700
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:30,140
they poached this mother bear in there,
Dan and left the,

701
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:33,680
the baby's essentially to die,
but they were talking about

702
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:35,980
how they're not going
to get caught doing it.

703
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:39,020
Like no one's going to tie us to this.
And the way they were caught,

704
00:41:39,021 --> 00:41:43,640
there was a four k camera that
was right behind them that was,

705
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:45,610
that was observing this,

706
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:48,980
this whole area where
this bear was den den.

707
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:53,480
They have these trail cameras now that
are incredibly accurate. There's so like,

708
00:41:53,481 --> 00:41:57,800
it's so high definition.
Super Clear and the audio is clear.

709
00:41:58,150 --> 00:41:59,720
They would catch one of
those fucking things. Yeah.

710
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:00,810
If there was something out there,

711
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:06,880
but I think there is something to
be said for the tooth fairy and

712
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:13,400
thinking we don't know everything like
that. It's fun. The magic of stuff,

713
00:42:13,401 --> 00:42:18,260
unknown and behind. I mean for me it
doesn't have to be big flip, but I love,

714
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:22,640
I love the idea that we haven't seen
everything. We don't know everything.

715
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:25,400
Obviously we know that
with space and who knows,

716
00:42:25,401 --> 00:42:28,070
you know and dimensions
and time and universe.

717
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:31,490
But something mythical is pretty fun.
Well,

718
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,760
what's interesting is that there was
a bunch of different kinds of humans.

719
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:37,940
That's what's interesting. And they
found these bones and Russia that,

720
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:41,530
I think they call them the
dentist's Whovians, they found a,

721
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:44,330
but this is within the last 10 15 years,

722
00:42:44,331 --> 00:42:47,720
they found a completely different
species of humans that lived in Russia.

723
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:51,440
They found those little people on the
island of Flores and that was only like 10

724
00:42:51,441 --> 00:42:52,880
years ago.
I mean there's,

725
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:56,540
there's probably dozens more that
they just haven't uncovered somewhere.

726
00:42:56,541 --> 00:42:59,150
So if there was at one point Tom,

727
00:42:59,151 --> 00:43:02,420
some big giant hominid it's
totally possible. Yeah.

728
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:07,090
I just don't think he would have to
eat so much to be alive. 10 today.

729
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:11,720
Beef constantly. It's like
a bear, like you find bear
shit everywhere. Where's the,

730
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:16,470
where's the gorilla shit, the big foot
shit or whatever it is. It's an easy,

731
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:19,550
is it eating plants? Is it eating
animals? What the fuck is it?

732
00:43:19,551 --> 00:43:21,980
Eating right can eat a lot.
A lot.

733
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:25,760
That's in big family of a
six foot something husband
at home and he, it's a lot,

734
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:29,840
a lot about all surfing all day
that that Duke could put it down.

735
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:33,800
He can put it down. Can you eat a
lot? A lot. I preposterous amounts,

736
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:38,450
foods and ideally big each meal or do you
started got okay, dinner and today, Hey,

737
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:41,990
what's your big nouns is white. How
are you feeling? Yeah, it depends.

738
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:44,660
Like sometimes I've
giant meals for dinner,

739
00:43:44,661 --> 00:43:47,660
but sometimes if I worked out too hard
at night I'll have a giant breakfast.

740
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:50,330
If I just,
I just do whatever I feel like doing,

741
00:43:50,331 --> 00:43:54,800
but I definitely always have intermittent
fasting. It's at least six days a week.

742
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:57,560
I take 16 hours off one day.
I don't give a fuck.

743
00:43:57,590 --> 00:44:01,820
It's amazing how much food we don't
really need to. Yeah, it is amazing.

744
00:44:01,821 --> 00:44:06,470
I used to eat way too much in like way
too much protein and stuff when I was

745
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:10,640
playing and going through
different phases of training. Um,

746
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:14,410
now do you go into like autophagy
and do all that tail? No. Oh, okay.

747
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:19,620
No one explained that to
people. Um, yeah. Well yeah,

748
00:44:19,621 --> 00:44:24,290
it just one sort of step,
a bigger alist a deeper step when you,

749
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:29,120
when you do a little bit intermittent
fasting is if you don't start the

750
00:44:29,121 --> 00:44:32,550
digestive process. So if you just
had, you can have water and caffeine,

751
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:35,440
you can't have fats and things like that.
Um,

752
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:40,400
the theory is is that
whatever soul, uh, you know,

753
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:45,240
dysfunction you have, you kind of can
rinse out kind of three times the amount,

754
00:44:45,570 --> 00:44:48,390
the process of when you
do intermittent fasting.

755
00:44:48,391 --> 00:44:53,070
So it can be a really effective way when
you're in a minute fasting to say, okay,

756
00:44:53,071 --> 00:44:56,850
I'm going to pick this four
hour window for most people,

757
00:44:56,851 --> 00:45:01,020
probably be between like three and seven
or two and six and I'm going to eat.

758
00:45:01,021 --> 00:45:04,890
And then the rest of the time I'm not
going to, so it's, it's very close.

759
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:09,390
It's just sort of one more twist they can
put on it. I think it's like a t o p o,

760
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:14,370
you know, so that's a 20 hour
fast food window every day. Yeah.

761
00:45:14,371 --> 00:45:17,000
And I have a friend who was doing
it pretty regularly and he used to,

762
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:21,180
he looked different. Really?
Yeah, please. Yeah, no he did.

763
00:45:21,181 --> 00:45:25,260
He shifted his body composition a
little bit and um, it was interesting.

764
00:45:25,261 --> 00:45:26,880
And there's some interesting data.

765
00:45:26,881 --> 00:45:31,050
I'm sure Jamie can give you the
download on it. Um, yeah, autophagy,

766
00:45:31,051 --> 00:45:34,620
it's just sorta like one notch
higher. It's not fun. But I, you know,

767
00:45:34,621 --> 00:45:36,720
like for me it would have to be kind of,

768
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:41,880
I would want to eat between one and five.

769
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:46,890
I could do without it the rest of the
time. Um, and you can have, like I said,

770
00:45:46,891 --> 00:45:47,760
caffeine and water.

771
00:45:47,810 --> 00:45:50,660
It's incredible what a
poll mouth pleasure has.

772
00:45:51,110 --> 00:45:53,660
Like my kids bought these estimates,
cupcakes.

773
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:57,260
They're those humans that's like old
school, old school, but they are bullshit.

774
00:45:57,290 --> 00:45:58,011
These cupcakes,

775
00:45:58,011 --> 00:46:02,360
they're like those
chocolate frosting on top,

776
00:46:02,950 --> 00:46:07,070
a little whites, Quigley. And the inside
is a cream filled. God Damn was delicious.

777
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:10,220
But while I was eating and I was like,
what the fuck are you eating man?

778
00:46:10,221 --> 00:46:12,730
This is all nonsense. You shouldn't
even be touching this. No.

779
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:15,120
Well you can't do that.
I think once you,

780
00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:18,560
cause we pretty strict Laird's have
a little more strict than I am. Um,

781
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:23,820
I think if you're going to eat that
cupcake, you enjoy it. Yep. I think,

782
00:46:24,070 --> 00:46:24,360
you know,

783
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:28,830
even having that small conversation with
yourself as a colossal waste of time,

784
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,620
as you shove it in your mouth
and it goes down, it's like,

785
00:46:32,850 --> 00:46:36,150
because that's so human, right? Like,
it's like, I shouldn't be doing this,

786
00:46:36,151 --> 00:46:40,050
but here I go, you know, why am I doing,
why I shouldn't? You know, it's like,

787
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,950
I think it's important to do
it and enjoy it. But yeah,

788
00:46:43,951 --> 00:46:45,160
that's not food that's like,

789
00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:46,260
I don't know what that is.

790
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:51,600
The thing can live for like 800 years
thing is we had eaten and I was full,

791
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:53,130
but that looks so good.

792
00:46:53,131 --> 00:46:56,580
Like if someone had cut a piece of steak
and put it in front of me, I'd be like,

793
00:46:56,581 --> 00:46:59,730
I'm good. I'm sorry I'm stuck.
I saw that cupcake. I was like,

794
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:02,730
look at that motherfucker that when
kids are like, I can't eat anymore.

795
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:05,640
What's for dessert?
I have a separate space for that.

796
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:11,280
That doesn't change because we're older.
I still have a separate space. It's just,

797
00:47:11,281 --> 00:47:11,640
you know,

798
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:14,880
try not to use it so much when they
say that for people that are in like

799
00:47:14,881 --> 00:47:16,960
competitive eating
competitions too though,

800
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:21,060
you can still eat fries because fries
or you don't like fries. You'd be like,

801
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:25,380
I just had the vision of a guy shoving
it in the water and then the Bun and the

802
00:47:25,381 --> 00:47:29,230
hot dog and then like, you know,
squeezing it down. Yeah, yeah.

803
00:47:29,231 --> 00:47:31,840
That you can eat fries. Cause what?
It's not protein. No, it's uh,

804
00:47:31,930 --> 00:47:36,460
it's the saltiness and the, the,
the, the carbs. You could still eat,

805
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:40,050
you can always eat another car.
He'll give, you ate a steak. Right.

806
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:44,590
And that steak was a big 18 ounce
ribeye. You ate the whole thing like, oh,

807
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,270
but then you see those fries,

808
00:47:46,271 --> 00:47:49,530
like all three of those fries
and deployments of Ketchup. Aw.

809
00:47:49,550 --> 00:47:50,740
There you could keep eating,

810
00:47:50,741 --> 00:47:54,880
you can eat another thousand calories
when you're in that food, like a trance,

811
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:59,650
you getting those food trends. Food
trances. Yeah. I mean you have people,

812
00:47:59,651 --> 00:48:03,640
I have friends that like, you know, if you
have any like thing out on the counter,

813
00:48:03,670 --> 00:48:05,670
that snack ish, like you
have it for the kids. Right.

814
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:08,590
And your friends that come to visit and
say hi and they're kind of fidgety and

815
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:11,260
all of a sudden they were just like eating
everything and you look at him like,

816
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:15,010
Bro, like you're in a constant
food. They like Trans Snack.

817
00:48:15,011 --> 00:48:18,580
It like don't have snacky, you know,
anything around is can't help themselves.

818
00:48:18,610 --> 00:48:22,630
Oh No. CanNot for sure. No,
I, but I find it easier.

819
00:48:22,631 --> 00:48:25,030
I don't know if you found it easier.
Like I had a,

820
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:28,390
I used to have a really
heavy chocolate trip heavy.

821
00:48:28,391 --> 00:48:33,250
Like I used to have a chocolate drawer,
like the whole thing, like no for real,

822
00:48:33,251 --> 00:48:36,650
like every kind of chocolate, like get
open it. And it wasn't like a thin door.

823
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:39,820
It wasn't like a silverware with drawer.
It was like a deep drawer.

824
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:44,680
Every kind of chocolate
and I mean stress,

825
00:48:44,681 --> 00:48:46,510
you have bus out the
chocolate, you know, whatever.

826
00:48:46,511 --> 00:48:48,910
Right before your time
chocolate kid walks in the room,

827
00:48:48,911 --> 00:48:52,920
they've taken something and you're
like chocolate. You know. So I'd had,

828
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:55,630
I had every kind and work it does,

829
00:48:55,631 --> 00:48:59,080
but then I stopped eating it as much and
now it's like I don't even really want

830
00:48:59,081 --> 00:49:01,330
it as as much. It's weird.
It's kind of a bummer.

831
00:49:01,490 --> 00:49:05,360
Really love dark chocolate
with peanut butter. Oh yeah.

832
00:49:05,361 --> 00:49:09,230
Like some dark chocolate pudding
to try it on their jiffy. Oh yeah.

833
00:49:09,231 --> 00:49:12,910
Some skippy and be some bullshit peanut
butter. I like the crunchy stuff too.

834
00:49:13,330 --> 00:49:17,500
So yeah, because the healthy stuff,
somehow the oil and the stuff is separate.

835
00:49:17,501 --> 00:49:21,370
You need that stuff that has like those
unknown chemicals to make it really

836
00:49:21,371 --> 00:49:24,820
smooth. If you like this natural peanut
butter, this isn't good. It's not smooth.

837
00:49:24,821 --> 00:49:28,840
Look at that
natural peanut butter.

838
00:49:28,841 --> 00:49:32,290
You got to get that
fucking butter sandwich,

839
00:49:32,291 --> 00:49:35,800
school lunch that you rip a hole in the
bride your life to knowing. Yeah, no,

840
00:49:35,801 --> 00:49:38,830
forget it. It's either too dry or
too oily. Yeah, it doesn't work.

841
00:49:38,831 --> 00:49:41,600
It's never perfect. You can't make a
sandwich with it. There's just no way.

842
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:46,900
You got to commit to a five minutes
stir before you ever even think about

843
00:49:46,901 --> 00:49:50,290
putting that shit on your
bread. Absolutely. Hey, so
you know what I was thinking,

844
00:49:50,291 --> 00:49:51,160
I wanted to invite you.

845
00:49:51,161 --> 00:49:54,340
You can bring whoever you want to come
pull train with us with pool training.

846
00:49:54,341 --> 00:49:56,890
What do you guys do
Jamie?

847
00:49:56,891 --> 00:50:00,610
Can you pull up like a pool
training or XPT pulled training.

848
00:50:00,930 --> 00:50:05,230
P T was that Sam for, this is another
thing that we do, but this kid,

849
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:09,370
this is like a 12 year old former
training. We built this pool and layered,

850
00:50:09,371 --> 00:50:12,880
you know it's always trying to, you
know, athletes in their off season and

851
00:50:14,770 --> 00:50:16,930
we were like his crap.
Like six of our friends.

852
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,660
We built this huge pool
and there it's like, okay,

853
00:50:20,110 --> 00:50:24,370
take some dumbbells and go down
a, there's Kyle Kingsbury. Yeah,

854
00:50:24,371 --> 00:50:27,410
you're big way anywhere. Says t
his little suit, the little girl to

855
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,590
do it. And uh, anyway, this
is all the shallow stuff,

856
00:50:32,591 --> 00:50:35,950
but there's deep water. That
girl didn't get going. Um,

857
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:38,440
they have dumbbells in their
crotches we'll get Kyle,

858
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:40,870
this is when he was a little bigger.

859
00:50:40,990 --> 00:50:45,280
Stoia do we have the idea of how,
okay,

860
00:50:45,281 --> 00:50:49,480
so there's deep water. Like you're
13 feet, you have w you have weights,

861
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:51,770
ballistic,
um,

862
00:50:54,270 --> 00:50:56,730
ballistic training. No. Uh,

863
00:50:57,630 --> 00:51:02,630
no punishment to your joints and doing
cleans in the ocean or in the pool

864
00:51:03,331 --> 00:51:05,430
rather. Yeah, I don't,
this is all shallow.

865
00:51:05,431 --> 00:51:10,230
There's some deep water stuff and I'm
not sure why that guy is doing a little,

866
00:51:11,790 --> 00:51:14,070
did you drop the Dumbo
all the way down to the,

867
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:16,150
so you have drag and stuff like that.

868
00:51:16,151 --> 00:51:19,210
And also it's lighter in the water and
heavier out. But this is not the stuff,

869
00:51:19,390 --> 00:51:22,330
I mean this is all good. It increases
your lung capacity and things like that.

870
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:27,040
But there is a deep water element where
so you can be ballistic and you can do

871
00:51:27,041 --> 00:51:29,430
all this stuff and um,

872
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:32,950
you don't pound your joints
and you can get stronger.

873
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:37,600
So we have a lot of athletes that come
and train so that they can sort of work

874
00:51:37,601 --> 00:51:40,750
on some of these elements of there
being more dynamic or what have you.

875
00:51:41,010 --> 00:51:44,890
You're in compression. It's, it's
pretty cool. And we couple it.

876
00:51:44,891 --> 00:51:46,870
So I know you like to do heat and stuff,

877
00:51:46,871 --> 00:51:50,470
so we'll do like heat and ice and then
pool and heat and ice and pool and things

878
00:51:50,471 --> 00:51:53,920
like that. It's, it's pretty great and
you're tired but you're not beat up.

879
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:57,560
George Saint Pierre actually did a lot
of that in training for his last fight.

880
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:59,120
He did a lot of his work.

881
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:02,830
Here's the deeper stuff I see.
So you can like,

882
00:52:02,890 --> 00:52:05,410
and what's cool about this too is,
um,

883
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:13,260
is that you have to moderate your breath
because it's very straight forward air,

884
00:52:13,831 --> 00:52:16,110
no air, air nowhere. And

885
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:19,730
just listening to this,
we're looking at these guys.

886
00:52:19,731 --> 00:52:21,380
It's probably like a nine foot pool.

887
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:25,910
They have dumbbells in their hands that
drop all the way down to the bottom and

888
00:52:25,911 --> 00:52:29,510
then let their knees go to full, full, uh,

889
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:34,540
bend and then with their butt to their
heels and then jump right back up and pop

890
00:52:35,241 --> 00:52:38,120
out of the water, get a deep breath,
and then go right back down again.

891
00:52:38,121 --> 00:52:41,720
So you're constantly leaping through
the water to go to the surface.

892
00:52:41,970 --> 00:52:43,100
Yeah,
the skin ripples.

893
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,770
So I actually think it's really
attractive when you're a girl too.

894
00:52:45,771 --> 00:52:48,710
I just want to tell you what's
crazy is that, think about this.

895
00:52:48,711 --> 00:52:52,340
I actually think so. You're
in compression, so you've
got those benefits, right.

896
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:56,290
And I think your tissue,
like your fashion,

897
00:52:56,300 --> 00:53:00,740
everything gets kind of rolled almost
in every, every set with that ripple.

898
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:04,720
I think so. And, and that they're
more shallow and then there's more,

899
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:06,110
there's deeper and things like that.

900
00:53:06,111 --> 00:53:08,840
But there's probably about 35
exercises that we've come up with.

901
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:13,160
Laird made us all his crash
test dummies. Um, but it,

902
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:17,420
it will economy makes you feel like
1 million bucks, but you can Kinda,

903
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:19,980
you can bust your butt on
it. Right. But you don't,

904
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:22,820
you're not getting in the pounding. Well
that's it. I already have a fake knee.

905
00:53:23,510 --> 00:53:25,170
Yeah. What'd you blow it out? Uh,

906
00:53:25,290 --> 00:53:30,290
well it was an ongoing since my
twenties and then finally at 46 I got it

907
00:53:31,651 --> 00:53:36,050
replaced. Wow. Is the difference now? Ah,

908
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:38,670
so much better. I was like, yeah,

909
00:53:38,671 --> 00:53:42,960
I used to like sleep with my good leg
underneath my knee trying to open my knee

910
00:53:42,961 --> 00:53:47,490
joint because it felt like metal on like
hot metal touching and then your foot

911
00:53:47,491 --> 00:53:51,870
gets heavy, you know, if you lose
a lot of your, your function.

912
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:52,771
I tried everything,

913
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:56,070
you know like stem cell and PRP and like
you try everything because you don't

914
00:53:56,071 --> 00:53:58,710
want to be like getting a fake knee.
And then after I was like,

915
00:53:58,711 --> 00:54:00,540
I'm sure there'll be
something better in 10 years,

916
00:54:00,541 --> 00:54:04,650
but right now let's just do it. So it
was, we went in the same day. We actually,

917
00:54:04,651 --> 00:54:06,660
Larry got his hip done the same
day and I got my knee done.

918
00:54:07,270 --> 00:54:12,060
How did Willard injuries hip
repetitive trauma, I mean,

919
00:54:12,090 --> 00:54:12,810
you know,

920
00:54:12,810 --> 00:54:17,490
Laird is now 55 he was
52 when he got his hip.

921
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:22,500
And he's, he's tough on his body.
I mean, he's tough on his body.

922
00:54:22,501 --> 00:54:25,020
And then if you're like
doing isometric loading,

923
00:54:25,021 --> 00:54:29,280
when the foiling that one hips taking a
head, it's the back leg. It's, you know,

924
00:54:29,281 --> 00:54:30,030
it's a lot,

925
00:54:30,030 --> 00:54:30,930
a lot of load.

926
00:54:30,990 --> 00:54:34,560
It's amazing though that he's gotten
back to surfing at the same level.

927
00:54:34,950 --> 00:54:39,600
It's, he's, he's very
unique. You know, he,

928
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:43,860
you know, he says that everything he does,
like his relationships, what he reads,

929
00:54:43,861 --> 00:54:45,750
what he eats,
um,

930
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:51,750
what he spends time doing is
all to enhance him to perform.

931
00:54:52,950 --> 00:54:57,750
And his, you know, a ton of people like
this, his ability to deal with discomfort,

932
00:54:57,751 --> 00:55:02,010
he has a very good relationship
with discomfort. So his
training and stuff, it's,

933
00:55:02,650 --> 00:55:03,200
you know,

934
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:06,080
wow. Those guys wind up
injuring themselves because
of the though that mental

935
00:55:06,081 --> 00:55:06,670
toughness.

936
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:09,910
But he's really smart. He's not a, well,

937
00:55:09,911 --> 00:55:13,600
you're not his age and foolhardy. He's
not like want to show it. I can do.

938
00:55:13,630 --> 00:55:17,050
He's a guy who can call it. He's a guy who
can go, yeah, no, it's not a good idea.

939
00:55:17,130 --> 00:55:18,240
So when they do the hip,

940
00:55:18,270 --> 00:55:21,390
they have to put that that raw through
the center of the hip and then put the

941
00:55:21,391 --> 00:55:23,160
new joint on the outside.

942
00:55:23,930 --> 00:55:26,240
It's all, I mean he
walked, he stayed awake.

943
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:30,260
They did a local and he left the
hospital at three o'clock that day. Wow.

944
00:55:30,290 --> 00:55:31,190
It's carpentry.

945
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:36,520
They whack out the doctor huge
that it's not fine surgery.

946
00:55:37,130 --> 00:55:40,310
It's like carpentry and he stayed awake
cause the guy's like, okay, you can,

947
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:42,910
you can handle it, you know, the noise or,

948
00:55:42,930 --> 00:55:43,763
or whatever.

949
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:50,710
He uh,
same time.

950
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:52,900
And then he was gone
out out of the hospital.

951
00:55:53,590 --> 00:55:57,880
How long did it take to rehabilitate?
Not Long. I mean he was,

952
00:55:58,420 --> 00:56:02,320
once the incision closed, he could go
out in the water. What's that? 10 days?

953
00:56:03,350 --> 00:56:06,360
Sure. Pretty cool. That's crazy
that they can do that now.

954
00:56:06,390 --> 00:56:08,160
I had a buddy who did that,
Graham Hancock.

955
00:56:08,161 --> 00:56:12,100
He did the six weeks later he was
here and he told me after we were,

956
00:56:12,101 --> 00:56:14,980
he was walking around, I was saying hi
to him. Was that I had my hip replaced.

957
00:56:14,981 --> 00:56:18,150
So I go when he was six weeks ago.
What the fuck are you talking about?

958
00:56:18,151 --> 00:56:20,070
You're just walking.
You just don't want to play golf.

959
00:56:20,071 --> 00:56:23,980
You walk out of the hospital.
Okay. Bad thing. Well, let's say if

960
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:26,650
you were loading your
hip that you load into,

961
00:56:26,651 --> 00:56:31,140
you might want to not do that right
away. It sounds weird, but yeah. Yeah.

962
00:56:31,141 --> 00:56:33,910
Like you'd put weird torque on it.
Yeah.

963
00:56:34,030 --> 00:56:37,720
I know a guys have gotten back to
Jujitsu with bad hips. Oh yeah.

964
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,670
Back to rolling and training again.
It's,

965
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:42,550
you know what they basically tell you
is you don't want to do anything you

966
00:56:42,551 --> 00:56:44,020
wouldn't want to do with your real joint.

967
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:46,690
Like the guys like Sophie
ever got into a car accident.

968
00:56:46,691 --> 00:56:49,630
You wouldn't want your knees to go back
and in towards your hip. It's like, okay,

969
00:56:49,631 --> 00:56:52,960
well I don't think I'd want that
to happen with my natural hip.

970
00:56:52,961 --> 00:56:57,360
So I think they're pretty good. Is it
significantly weaker? No, not at all.

971
00:56:57,380 --> 00:57:02,050
Not at all. No. Do basically everything.
He can do everything. Wow. That's crazy.

972
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:03,880
And he had a pretty wicked limp.

973
00:57:04,030 --> 00:57:06,490
The two of us were limping around for
like two years. It was really cool.

974
00:57:06,491 --> 00:57:09,080
People are like, Hey, you guys
are those like athletes, right?

975
00:57:09,081 --> 00:57:11,560
That a couple of them were like
hobbling around. We're like, yeah,

976
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:16,180
stay right there. We'll be right there. It
was just like brutal. Our kids are like,

977
00:57:16,181 --> 00:57:18,860
what are you going to do? Like I'm
just going to run away, you know,

978
00:57:19,950 --> 00:57:24,520
a way I stop it right there. You know,
what can you do now with your knee?

979
00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:26,410
Can you do all the things
that used to be able to do?

980
00:57:27,390 --> 00:57:31,930
It would be a bummer for Jujitsu guys
cause kneeling is kind of not the best.

981
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:34,600
Like if he said, give me 1 million
bucks cash right now, child's pose.

982
00:57:34,601 --> 00:57:39,040
I bet that's tough. Yeah,
that's tough. What part hurts?

983
00:57:40,450 --> 00:57:44,150
Uh, I think for me it's also part
of my bio mechanics that, uh,

984
00:57:44,170 --> 00:57:46,300
the tissue on my, uh, um,

985
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:51,040
my quads is like probably like beef
jerky from jumping all those years.

986
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:53,710
So that's something I'm always working on.
Um,

987
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:57,850
so maybe a more flexible person going
in would have more mobility in that bent

988
00:57:57,851 --> 00:58:01,120
position. But it just, you know, you
get a hard finish on it on the joint.

989
00:58:01,121 --> 00:58:04,450
But I think it's pretty
amazing what you can do.

990
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:08,740
Like it's pretty far out.
Can you sidestep and stuff like that.

991
00:58:08,790 --> 00:58:12,610
I could play volleyball if I wanted to.
You can jump and land and be hard on it.

992
00:58:12,611 --> 00:58:15,370
And Joey do pliers and stuff.
Yeah.

993
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:18,640
So they basically say just do stuff that
you would do normally with your knee.

994
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:22,330
Yeah, I mean, yes B be intelligent.

995
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:26,020
Like you probably wouldn't want to go
all I'm an ultra marathon or now. Right.

996
00:58:26,170 --> 00:58:30,790
Cause you might wear your joint out in
like two years. But I think if you said,

997
00:58:30,791 --> 00:58:35,710
I really like to run but I'll go on
the grass or the sand barefoot probably

998
00:58:35,711 --> 00:58:40,410
better stuff like that. But that's what
you want to do again anyway. You know,

999
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:43,420
running s pretty tough on Ya. Yeah.
And it's not just tough on your knees.

1000
00:58:43,421 --> 00:58:44,950
It's tough on your back
and stuff and everything.

1001
00:58:44,951 --> 00:58:47,530
Are you wearing on a hard surface,
seven times your body weight, right.

1002
00:58:47,531 --> 00:58:50,200
Like each step, I mean,
unless you're built,

1003
00:58:50,201 --> 00:58:54,220
like when you see those people that
are built to run, it's perfect. Yeah.

1004
00:58:54,221 --> 00:58:56,320
So that was,
that was sort of,

1005
00:58:56,650 --> 00:58:59,600
I think that's what's interesting
about being when you see people go, Oh,

1006
00:58:59,601 --> 00:59:03,160
I'm an athlete and, and then it's
like, and some days I feel, I don't,

1007
00:59:03,161 --> 00:59:07,690
I'm sure you feel this way.
It's like I feel so unathletic or so,

1008
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:08,613
uh,

1009
00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:12,940
banged up or you know,

1010
00:59:12,970 --> 00:59:15,880
like I have friends that came
into training late and everything,

1011
00:59:15,881 --> 00:59:18,880
all their joints are like
all perfect and you know,

1012
00:59:19,150 --> 00:59:23,570
they work perfectly in and sometimes I,
I've, I've felt a little bit beat up.

1013
00:59:23,571 --> 00:59:28,280
Laird been beat up a lot, but he, he kind
of trains his way out of it. Big Time.

1014
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:31,070
Now when you guys are on coal,
why,

1015
00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:35,810
is there a lot of resources in terms
of like places to train or physical

1016
00:59:35,811 --> 00:59:37,600
therapists or any of that kind of stuff?

1017
00:59:37,660 --> 00:59:41,140
No, I think the other islands,
like a Wahoo and Maui, they
would certainly have it.

1018
00:59:41,410 --> 00:59:45,880
I was, I actually, um, this group
that owns this business there,

1019
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:50,920
let me use a warehouse and
I taught a class three days
a week for free, a dollar.

1020
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:56,170
Um, so they were covered under my
insurance because we have so little, uh,

1021
00:59:56,290 --> 00:59:59,050
training like we have, we have
access, we have a gem and stuff,

1022
00:59:59,051 --> 01:00:03,310
but like the community on the north
didn't really, so I started, uh,

1023
01:00:03,430 --> 01:00:07,360
doing that like three days a week to get
people, there was like a hundred of us.

1024
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:11,450
Oh, that's the same time it was,
it was really cool. Uh, but,

1025
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:15,670
but because they don't have stuff to,
they don't have really great facilities.

1026
01:00:16,330 --> 01:00:20,170
What a weird place to live. Is it,
it's kind of bad, but don't you think?

1027
01:00:20,171 --> 01:00:21,940
Like when I go to New
York City with layered,

1028
01:00:21,941 --> 01:00:23,950
he looks there and he looks at
the buildings and he's like,

1029
01:00:23,951 --> 01:00:27,430
why do people do this to themselves?
Like, we've gotten twisted around like,

1030
01:00:27,431 --> 01:00:31,540
you're like Hawaii, what a weird
place to live. But in a way,

1031
01:00:31,690 --> 01:00:35,700
it's probably closer to how
we're meant to live, you know,

1032
01:00:35,710 --> 01:00:39,580
stacked up on top of each
other. But having said that, um,

1033
01:00:40,330 --> 01:00:43,390
yeah. Compared to other parts of
the world, I mean in its remote,

1034
01:00:43,450 --> 01:00:46,240
like you're out there, it's,
I think besides Easter island,

1035
01:00:46,241 --> 01:00:50,350
it's like the most remote
place in the world. Wow. Yeah.

1036
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:55,930
Really that's interesting. But it makes
sense. Yeah, it's far. I mean, you know,

1037
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:57,160
they navigated their,

1038
01:00:57,161 --> 01:01:01,570
and they said that the water sea level
was lower so that they could see more

1039
01:01:01,571 --> 01:01:06,370
land when the Polynesian sailed there.
But it's pretty,

1040
01:01:06,371 --> 01:01:10,720
uh, it's a pretty interesting
contrast to living in Malibu,

1041
01:01:10,830 --> 01:01:14,840
let's say. But then in a way, not because
you're surrounded by nature, right?

1042
01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:16,340
Yeah.

1043
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:19,340
I think it's probably a far more
healthy way to live. I just,

1044
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:21,770
I just know that a lot of
people do get that island fever,

1045
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:23,960
they can't take it and they
want to get the fuck off.

1046
01:01:24,610 --> 01:01:26,920
Yeah. And like if when you have a
family, like when our kids were young,

1047
01:01:26,921 --> 01:01:29,200
it's like you're doing the same thing.
You're taking them places.

1048
01:01:29,201 --> 01:01:30,880
You are making dinners,
you're making lunches.

1049
01:01:30,881 --> 01:01:34,660
So in a way you're just doing sort of
everyday things in a really pretty place.

1050
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:37,480
And also you probably
live a little simpler.

1051
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:43,150
It's gotta be better for you in terms
of like the amount of stress that you

1052
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:47,860
experience and the beauty of nature's
very calming and soothing and probably

1053
01:01:47,861 --> 01:01:49,450
therapeutic and beneficial.

1054
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:54,610
Yeah. But it's that reminder. I
mean, this has been thing for me.

1055
01:01:54,611 --> 01:01:58,390
It's like you could have all that
at your access, but if you're not,

1056
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:03,210
if you haven't dealt with
yourself or you're not, if
you're feel miserable, um, it,

1057
01:02:03,310 --> 01:02:04,720
it sort of doesn't really matter.

1058
01:02:04,780 --> 01:02:07,840
And I think that that kind of
place points it out really quick,

1059
01:02:07,930 --> 01:02:09,160
where when you live in a busy place,

1060
01:02:09,161 --> 01:02:12,340
you can distract yourself from
yourself and you can be like, oh,

1061
01:02:12,341 --> 01:02:15,070
there's traffic and I have stuff to
do and I'm busy. I'm a busy person,

1062
01:02:15,071 --> 01:02:20,040
I'm at an office, I Delta stock. And
when you're there, you can't blame

1063
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:24,150
really the traffic. You can, you
sort of have to go, oh, that's right.

1064
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:28,080
So it's an interesting thing of
when we talk about like health or,

1065
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:30,750
or beautiful places and things like that,

1066
01:02:30,751 --> 01:02:35,751
it's still always comes
back to yourself and like,

1067
01:02:35,850 --> 01:02:38,820
am I, have I made myself happy? Um,

1068
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:41,520
am I doing things that make me feel good?
Things like that.

1069
01:02:41,521 --> 01:02:45,120
So I think what's really great about
that places that gets clear real quick.

1070
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:47,730
Did you guys have real internet out there?

1071
01:02:48,390 --> 01:02:53,130
Totally like legit and I mean we had
dial up til about 18 months ago for real.

1072
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:57,360
No, but I mean do you
have high speed or nodes?

1073
01:02:57,380 --> 01:03:00,300
Like it is America for like
five genius or whatever.

1074
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:04,230
They've got that blanket over us there
but it isn't the mind control five g net

1075
01:03:04,231 --> 01:03:06,030
or whatever.
Everybody's worried about that.

1076
01:03:06,060 --> 01:03:08,940
I know I have a friend
freaking out about it.

1077
01:03:09,090 --> 01:03:13,140
Five g well we did Rudy. Something
about they do have the ability to,

1078
01:03:13,141 --> 01:03:16,950
it does have an effect on human brains,
but that's what I mean. It's like pretty,

1079
01:03:17,010 --> 01:03:20,430
pretty serious. We're going to do
ourselves in one day with innovation.

1080
01:03:20,431 --> 01:03:22,020
We're going to keep going.
Absolutely.

1081
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:26,640
One day we've well fucked ourselves
sideways. That's the way that it,

1082
01:03:26,670 --> 01:03:29,750
it goes right?
Like you get so smart that you evolve.

1083
01:03:29,910 --> 01:03:33,510
You're like check the I when I was a
kid we had a mad magazine and I'll never

1084
01:03:33,511 --> 01:03:33,961
forget it.

1085
01:03:33,961 --> 01:03:38,760
I was like 11 years old and there was
a s a sketch of this explosion in space

1086
01:03:39,090 --> 01:03:42,690
and it was like two aliens talking and
they were looking at at this explosion,

1087
01:03:42,750 --> 01:03:45,780
you know, millions of miles
away. And they go, oh,

1088
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:49,920
they said smart beings lived
there, you know, pretty much,

1089
01:03:49,950 --> 01:03:53,250
I mean I think that in a way that we're,
we're probably,

1090
01:03:53,370 --> 01:03:56,550
I mean we do a lot with water
and air and things like that,

1091
01:03:56,551 --> 01:03:58,680
but it is interesting to see,

1092
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:01,530
I'm always fascinated that
people will do stuff for money.

1093
01:04:02,130 --> 01:04:04,860
Like guys like guys running
companies and they go, well,

1094
01:04:04,861 --> 01:04:07,830
it's okay about the pollution or
the byproduct and you go, yeah,

1095
01:04:07,831 --> 01:04:10,590
but your kids or your
grandkids are going to like,

1096
01:04:10,591 --> 01:04:15,591
money's not going to protect you
from if the climate goes bizarre.

1097
01:04:16,410 --> 01:04:20,010
Yeah. But they feel like someone else
can fix that. They go to get this money.

1098
01:04:20,370 --> 01:04:23,850
He thinks that money. Yeah. I think
that's just a compartmentalization.

1099
01:04:23,910 --> 01:04:27,660
They just don't, don't think about the,
also, they're a part of a corporation.

1100
01:04:27,661 --> 01:04:31,680
Right. And everybody just does their
little task. But it does trip me out.

1101
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,820
Like she'd go like, you know, we say
the rain falls on everyone's house.

1102
01:04:35,821 --> 01:04:38,910
Like it's coming for everybody, no
matter how much cheese you have. Well,

1103
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:40,690
it's also the fact that we've had on it.

1104
01:04:40,691 --> 01:04:45,691
It has been over this window of a hundred
years long and it's a massive effect.

1105
01:04:47,100 --> 01:04:49,530
I mean, unbelievably massive
effect on the environment.

1106
01:04:49,531 --> 01:04:52,530
It's just a short window of
time. In terms of, you know,

1107
01:04:53,340 --> 01:04:58,340
when you, I'm sure you saw Jiro dreams
of Sushi. Yeah, of course. Yeah.

1108
01:04:58,660 --> 01:05:02,670
When they're sitting around talking about
the fish markets back in the day we'd

1109
01:05:02,671 --> 01:05:06,270
get so much more tuna.
Like you look one day it's fished out.

1110
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:07,800
This is one year alive man.

1111
01:05:07,801 --> 01:05:11,970
So when this guys in during his lifetime
and went from abundance of tuna to

1112
01:05:11,971 --> 01:05:16,860
being almost fished out. Yep. And they're
not slowing down sushis everywhere.

1113
01:05:16,930 --> 01:05:18,010
It's like,
I know what

1114
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:21,810
we'd done in 30 years is pretty
far out. It's crazy. I know. It's,

1115
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:25,030
I know it's an I,
it's funny cause my kids,

1116
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:27,700
I don't know if you see this
with your kids, it's like,

1117
01:05:28,570 --> 01:05:32,140
I think they're pretty aware
of it. Um, and they, uh,

1118
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:38,280
I think that they go flip and flop
between feeling like the adults are poorly

1119
01:05:39,131 --> 01:05:42,610
behaved and they're left of the pile of,
you know,

1120
01:05:43,510 --> 01:05:45,490
of our bad decisions.

1121
01:05:46,060 --> 01:05:48,970
And also like my one daughter's like is,

1122
01:05:49,220 --> 01:05:52,390
do you think it'd be okay to be like
a militant environmentalist? You know,

1123
01:05:52,391 --> 01:05:54,670
and she's like six feet tall. And
I'm like, that'd be fantastic.

1124
01:05:56,020 --> 01:06:00,670
Sea Shepherd on steroids. It's like,
you know, you know, so I think,

1125
01:06:00,671 --> 01:06:03,220
uh, it's going to be
interesting to see, you know,

1126
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:06,400
what the next group because
they're obviously really different.

1127
01:06:06,401 --> 01:06:10,720
Like they don't want big giant houses
and all that stuff that, you know,

1128
01:06:10,721 --> 01:06:12,940
sort of my generation and your generation

1129
01:06:13,030 --> 01:06:16,410
thought that's what you think the new
generation is different in their values

1130
01:06:16,411 --> 01:06:17,680
and what they find is important,
right?

1131
01:06:18,060 --> 01:06:22,170
They, they give more, they volunteer more.

1132
01:06:22,171 --> 01:06:26,100
I think the tricky thing for them is going
to be connection and being able to be

1133
01:06:26,101 --> 01:06:30,630
connected and being able to
have a real conversation and uh,

1134
01:06:31,650 --> 01:06:34,470
you know, even be able to
concentrate long enough to,

1135
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:38,590
to be with somebody because of devices.
Yeah. I mean, I think it's far.

1136
01:06:38,730 --> 01:06:41,180
Could you imagine right
now if you were 20 no.

1137
01:06:41,490 --> 01:06:45,700
And being like dating and swiping
and trying to pay attention and

1138
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:47,320
10,
you know my daughter,

1139
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:49,550
one of the few girls in her
closet doesn't have a cell phone.

1140
01:06:49,790 --> 01:06:51,560
What's the age that do they get?
I'm like,

1141
01:06:52,190 --> 01:06:55,630
I've had them since they were like
seven. No, I mean you're a kid.

1142
01:06:55,650 --> 01:06:56,900
Like what's the rule in your house?

1143
01:06:56,901 --> 01:06:59,690
There's a debate right now trying
to figure it out. Well, okay,

1144
01:06:59,691 --> 01:07:01,820
so you have a 10 year
old going to be 11 yeah.

1145
01:07:01,821 --> 01:07:06,210
I think that they say there's
like a movement. Wait til eighth.

1146
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:10,550
Yeah. You heard that you had like 10
kids in the class. All the parents agree.

1147
01:07:10,551 --> 01:07:13,070
So they're not the only person in
the class that doesn't have it,

1148
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:16,910
but it's not that way with my daughter's
kids. They're kids in her class.

1149
01:07:16,911 --> 01:07:20,720
Most of them have phones.
Most parents just give the
kid a phone. Yeah. It's just,

1150
01:07:20,721 --> 01:07:22,310
um,
there's a,

1151
01:07:22,910 --> 01:07:25,880
have you read any of Jonathan hates stuff?

1152
01:07:26,070 --> 01:07:27,680
The coddling of the
American media of course.

1153
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:30,710
And that that has just so disturbing
when you see the amount of,

1154
01:07:31,070 --> 01:07:33,590
especially young girls that
are growing up, depressed,

1155
01:07:33,650 --> 01:07:35,540
cutting themselves self harm.

1156
01:07:35,780 --> 01:07:40,250
What's that like 400% he said like from
10 to 14 or something crazy like that.

1157
01:07:40,251 --> 01:07:41,510
Like something insane.

1158
01:07:41,511 --> 01:07:44,930
Massive spike that directly coincides
with the invention of smartphones and

1159
01:07:44,931 --> 01:07:47,270
social media. Yeah,
the slot machine. Yeah.

1160
01:07:47,271 --> 01:07:51,200
It's this this thing where people were
just trying to get likes and trying to

1161
01:07:51,230 --> 01:07:52,490
leverage their,
you know,

1162
01:07:52,491 --> 01:07:56,510
their social status and and try to
pretend that they're living in a perfect

1163
01:07:56,511 --> 01:07:59,840
world to everybody around
them and everyone else is
doing it and people look at

1164
01:07:59,841 --> 01:08:02,780
other people's lives being perfect
and they reflect upon their own.

1165
01:08:02,781 --> 01:08:03,501
They get depressed.

1166
01:08:03,501 --> 01:08:07,430
There's just so many factors that kids
didn't have to deal with just to a decade

1167
01:08:07,431 --> 01:08:09,820
or so ago. It's really, really off.

1168
01:08:09,970 --> 01:08:10,210
Right.

1169
01:08:10,210 --> 01:08:13,990
Like at least if I had a hard time at
school I could go home and have a reprieve

1170
01:08:13,991 --> 01:08:15,470
from it at least overnight.

1171
01:08:15,890 --> 01:08:19,370
I think for me that's been a
thing with my kids is like,

1172
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:21,530
cause especially daughters,

1173
01:08:21,531 --> 01:08:24,380
I do think I understand the gaming
is different for boys and porn,

1174
01:08:24,530 --> 01:08:28,340
pornography and things like that and not
whole trip of rewiring their brain. And,

1175
01:08:28,970 --> 01:08:30,590
but I think with girls it's like

1176
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:38,080
how do you get them to under
like get hear their own voice?

1177
01:08:38,301 --> 01:08:41,660
I don't know how they're going to get to
a place where they, I mean cause every,

1178
01:08:41,661 --> 01:08:44,690
it's like this weird
mishmosh of like me too.

1179
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:49,720
And then never before had people objectify
themselves more because they get that

1180
01:08:50,510 --> 01:08:55,310
positive affirmation. Like I always say,
if I put out really smart ideas, um,

1181
01:08:55,311 --> 01:08:58,610
if I'm a young woman,
oh I have a thousand followers,

1182
01:08:58,940 --> 01:09:02,720
every shot is of my,
but I have 10 million followers.

1183
01:09:02,780 --> 01:09:06,020
So we have this mixed message going on,
which is like,

1184
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:10,520
I'm angry me to treat me
equal simultaneously to,

1185
01:09:11,210 --> 01:09:16,210
I'm going to objectify myself in the most
hardcore way more than in any time in

1186
01:09:17,061 --> 01:09:17,570
history.

1187
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:21,620
And I talked to the results and it's
really blow it blow for me as a female

1188
01:09:21,621 --> 01:09:26,060
who's, who understands both
those sides a little bit. Um, I,

1189
01:09:26,061 --> 01:09:31,010
it kind of trips me out because I
don't think you like those girls,

1190
01:09:31,070 --> 01:09:34,550
you know, playing that card and have
no violence should be done to you.

1191
01:09:34,551 --> 01:09:37,070
And I agree with all of that
and no is no and all of that.

1192
01:09:37,490 --> 01:09:39,080
But at a certain point,
you know,

1193
01:09:39,081 --> 01:09:41,210
like you've had Jordan
Peterson on here many times.

1194
01:09:41,211 --> 01:09:43,610
It's like biological signaling.

1195
01:09:43,611 --> 01:09:46,610
It's like w w like play a side at least.

1196
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:50,990
And also that, oh, that's, that
one side is super short lived.

1197
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:54,650
That's what I tried to tell my girls. I'm
like, Yo, listen, if you're, you know,

1198
01:09:54,651 --> 01:09:56,180
you're pretty girls,
it's great,

1199
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:59,960
but if that's the card you're
playing your cards done,

1200
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:04,040
like by the time you're 30, 35,
it's done. It's over. Um, you know,

1201
01:10:04,041 --> 01:10:06,620
unless you're like 40 and you marry a
seven year old, I don't know, whatever,

1202
01:10:06,910 --> 01:10:11,330
the MILF porn, is that
such a thing? Yeah. Yeah.

1203
01:10:11,331 --> 01:10:14,600
But even that, it's like they've
got to put a filter on it.

1204
01:10:14,601 --> 01:10:19,250
And I'm like all that stuff. I
mean come on. You know what I mean?

1205
01:10:19,251 --> 01:10:21,740
It's like at a certain point,
how do you get these girls to go,

1206
01:10:21,741 --> 01:10:26,240
hey stand up for yourself. Be
Strong. But like what are you doing?

1207
01:10:26,300 --> 01:10:29,420
But look at all these people that are
not doing that. They're are benefiting.

1208
01:10:30,110 --> 01:10:33,140
I know but it's getting them to understand
how do you get a 13 year old to talk

1209
01:10:33,141 --> 01:10:35,430
about the long game?
Yeah,

1210
01:10:35,530 --> 01:10:39,770
I mean everything's immediate but for
me it's like it's culturally I feel like

1211
01:10:39,771 --> 01:10:44,120
I'm this weird mix of like the most,
I came through it the most modern time.

1212
01:10:44,121 --> 01:10:48,550
Like women went to school on
scholarships and like we, we,

1213
01:10:49,310 --> 01:10:54,290
there was no thought to being
like strong. Not really. And then,

1214
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:58,910
but then weirdly it's like I feel so kind
of old fashion when I see kind of this

1215
01:10:58,911 --> 01:11:00,800
next thing cause I'm like well strong.
For me,

1216
01:11:00,801 --> 01:11:05,150
it was something else strong was like
you were really physically strong trying

1217
01:11:05,151 --> 01:11:07,460
to have a strong mind,
you know,

1218
01:11:08,450 --> 01:11:12,860
strong basis of a person and then okay,
then there was this other side, like your,

1219
01:11:13,470 --> 01:11:16,910
your sexuality, all this other stuff.
And now it's like, I don't know, I,

1220
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:18,560
it's very interesting,
right?

1221
01:11:18,610 --> 01:11:20,890
Well there's certainly a bunch of
different kinds of people, right?

1222
01:11:20,891 --> 01:11:24,550
And there's going to be people that
gravitate towards objectifying themselves

1223
01:11:24,740 --> 01:11:28,280
and this kind of people that gravitate
in this day and age towards, you know,

1224
01:11:28,330 --> 01:11:31,870
you see a lot of people's pages are
just fill with motivational quotes and

1225
01:11:31,871 --> 01:11:33,850
inspirational things and you know,

1226
01:11:33,851 --> 01:11:37,780
and then the stories about people that
they meet and photos and you get a lot of

1227
01:11:37,781 --> 01:11:40,210
people that are attracted to that
kind of stuff too. It's just,

1228
01:11:40,450 --> 01:11:43,390
you're not going to get the immediate
gratification of a picture of your ass

1229
01:11:43,530 --> 01:11:46,930
that that picture of your ass
gets 100,000 likes. Like, wow,

1230
01:11:46,931 --> 01:11:49,350
look at all those likes.
And then, you know,

1231
01:11:49,540 --> 01:11:51,970
it's just a different vibe and
you have to decide what do you,

1232
01:11:51,971 --> 01:11:56,470
after you have to quantity or quality
or after you are trying to accurately

1233
01:11:56,471 --> 01:11:57,700
express how you feel and,

1234
01:11:57,790 --> 01:12:01,570
and work it out through communicating
with people and figure out how they react

1235
01:12:01,571 --> 01:12:04,870
to what you're saying and how you feel
about how other people say similar things

1236
01:12:04,871 --> 01:12:07,600
and how it does good things for you.
And you want to do good things for them.

1237
01:12:07,900 --> 01:12:12,900
Or do you just want to have a piece of
dental floss up the crack of your ass

1238
01:12:13,750 --> 01:12:15,730
sticking it in front of
the camera? This, you know?

1239
01:12:16,020 --> 01:12:19,650
No, and I, I get that. Like
I get also, like I always say
when you're a young woman,

1240
01:12:19,651 --> 01:12:22,110
you sort of get this new car and
you're like, well, what happens?

1241
01:12:22,111 --> 01:12:25,560
Like what if I put my foot on the gas?
Like you're sort of checking it all out.

1242
01:12:25,561 --> 01:12:29,280
Like who they respond like this if I do
that, like that's completely natural.

1243
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:34,200
But then at a certain point, um, I
don't know that the input is like,

1244
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:38,340
uh, you know, like, who do you want to be?

1245
01:12:38,580 --> 01:12:41,310
And not based on what
everyone thinks about you,

1246
01:12:41,311 --> 01:12:46,311
like what actually turns you on and s
and s makes you feel excited and stoked

1247
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:50,370
because you know it's great
that you have a nice butt,

1248
01:12:50,371 --> 01:12:54,930
but there's a lot of Nice butts and in
the end that's not probably going to

1249
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:58,920
bring you that other feeling.

1250
01:12:58,980 --> 01:13:03,030
The problem is that there's a thrill
to positive reaction. Absolutely.

1251
01:13:03,150 --> 01:13:06,900
And that thrills undeniable. I
would like it. I'm just too old

1252
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:11,200
people. And when people get that
thrill and you tell them, hey,

1253
01:13:11,201 --> 01:13:13,230
that thrills bad for you.
You look fuck off mom.

1254
01:13:13,380 --> 01:13:15,810
No, no, I mean a bolt onto
that message. How about that?

1255
01:13:15,811 --> 01:13:18,660
Like get the thrill but
simultaneously to doing the thrill.

1256
01:13:18,990 --> 01:13:21,000
Maybe have some other
thoughts about where you,

1257
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:23,660
where you like to continue to journey too.

1258
01:13:24,750 --> 01:13:26,760
I think when you tell
that to a 13 year old,

1259
01:13:26,761 --> 01:13:30,150
the here and eventually I think in
the beginning of the like gay, yeah,

1260
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:32,540
I got this.
And then later when it all goes sideways,

1261
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:34,020
like God damn wish to listen to mom.

1262
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:38,070
I think you just got to be it too and
have some like cool friends that hang

1263
01:13:38,071 --> 01:13:41,220
around you because you're, if
you're the parent it's like, okay,

1264
01:13:41,221 --> 01:13:42,600
you're going to penetrate so much.

1265
01:13:42,601 --> 01:13:45,360
But if you've got some like you know
in Hawaii they call them aunties.

1266
01:13:45,750 --> 01:13:49,560
If he got some Badass chicks around you
and your daughters are looking, they see,

1267
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:52,710
they say,
but what if you don't have access to that?

1268
01:13:52,711 --> 01:13:55,920
I have a lot of pretty strong,
cool women around me,

1269
01:13:55,921 --> 01:14:00,120
but I could not that it concerns me.
I don't want to say that.

1270
01:14:00,121 --> 01:14:04,890
It's just how to you help the next group,
you know,

1271
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:07,500
try to be a good example.
Love on them,

1272
01:14:07,501 --> 01:14:11,830
but get them to teach them to
love on themselves. That's all.

1273
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:12,993
And I don't mean,

1274
01:14:13,910 --> 01:14:14,480
yeah,

1275
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:18,260
with eyelash extensions and perfect
things. I mean like love on yourself,

1276
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:21,140
you know?
Well that's the other thing too.

1277
01:14:21,141 --> 01:14:26,120
This is a distortion distortion
of natural beauty and you know,

1278
01:14:26,150 --> 01:14:30,230
make it so that everything has to be
artificial. The color of your lips,

1279
01:14:30,231 --> 01:14:34,890
the color of your eye, shadow, fake
lashes, everything is just this,

1280
01:14:36,110 --> 01:14:40,850
that doesn't, doesn't look better.
Just looks different. Do you think I,

1281
01:14:40,851 --> 01:14:45,800
I'm always fascinated what men
think like today, even like do they,

1282
01:14:45,801 --> 01:14:49,370
does it even register? Do they
know what's going on? In what way?

1283
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:56,730
Well, I guess we'd have to ask men of
that generation if, let's say they had,

1284
01:14:57,440 --> 01:14:58,273
uh,

1285
01:14:58,410 --> 01:15:03,300
two groups of women and one that was
like perfectly quaffed with the lip

1286
01:15:03,301 --> 01:15:06,440
injection. And is it,

1287
01:15:07,740 --> 01:15:11,420
I like that I'm talking about like eyelash
extension is one of the Joe, but, um,

1288
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:14,790
like just sort of really done like
ready for the club, let's just say.

1289
01:15:14,910 --> 01:15:17,490
And then just like a girl,
like, hi, I'm a, you know,

1290
01:15:18,330 --> 01:15:22,680
I'm a sweaty runner and now I'm going to
go to the office and put my hair up in

1291
01:15:22,681 --> 01:15:26,790
a ponytail. I don't know what
her, if guys, if they even,

1292
01:15:26,820 --> 01:15:28,470
can they tell the difference?

1293
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:35,540
I mean, it's all what you're
in, what your entails.

1294
01:15:36,330 --> 01:15:37,570
Some guys just like,
um,

1295
01:15:38,130 --> 01:15:43,130
soft and made up some guys
like I'm sweaty and muscular.

1296
01:15:43,260 --> 01:15:46,410
Yeah, still. And I get all
that. I love that. I just mean,

1297
01:15:48,380 --> 01:15:51,980
again, it's hardcore signaling and I
guess that's, maybe that's what it is.

1298
01:15:51,981 --> 01:15:54,470
Maybe it's the new biology.
Well,

1299
01:15:54,471 --> 01:15:58,970
it's also that there's never been a time
like I that a bit on one of my Netflix

1300
01:15:58,971 --> 01:16:02,690
specials were about this girl
who's got just pictures of her ass.

1301
01:16:02,691 --> 01:16:05,030
She was like 9 million followers
on Instagram. I'm like,

1302
01:16:05,031 --> 01:16:06,590
there's never been a
person like this before.

1303
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:08,930
This is a new kind of person like fuck,
fuck.

1304
01:16:09,170 --> 01:16:12,890
Looking at these frogs in the Amazon
that no one's going to say there's a new

1305
01:16:12,891 --> 01:16:13,790
kind of person.

1306
01:16:14,030 --> 01:16:17,810
This girl just has pictures of her butt
and she's got millions of people staring

1307
01:16:17,811 --> 01:16:20,420
at her all day long and every
day is just new pictures of her,

1308
01:16:20,421 --> 01:16:24,230
but it's a great point. I always am
intrigued how they decide like, oh,

1309
01:16:24,231 --> 01:16:28,220
we're going to do the but on the beach
now let's do the button next to the puppy.

1310
01:16:28,220 --> 01:16:30,680
It's like, I'm so confused
how they keep getting ideas.

1311
01:16:30,681 --> 01:16:34,370
I can't even get ideas for different
things and it's like, I know we'll do,

1312
01:16:34,371 --> 01:16:38,090
but with the cotton candy it's like,
okay, I don't know why he's got that.

1313
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:40,310
I think it becomes an obsession.
I mean,

1314
01:16:40,311 --> 01:16:43,040
I think you have to stay
fresh with new bud ideas.

1315
01:16:43,420 --> 01:16:46,730
Is that envelope take my editor

1316
01:16:48,530 --> 01:16:53,300
head editor here@but.com I don't know.

1317
01:16:53,420 --> 01:16:55,160
But if you have a girl who has,

1318
01:16:55,220 --> 01:16:58,190
let's say some of these girls have
millions and millions of followers and

1319
01:16:58,191 --> 01:17:00,410
they're making millions of
dollars are crushing it.

1320
01:17:00,680 --> 01:17:03,470
Maybe they're actually the smartest
people in the room and I haven't caught on

1321
01:17:03,471 --> 01:17:06,080
yet.
It's certainly an easy path to finances.

1322
01:17:06,130 --> 01:17:09,740
And I know if you have a great ass and
you're like working out and you just want

1323
01:17:09,741 --> 01:17:10,250
to take pictures

1324
01:17:10,250 --> 01:17:13,010
of it and all of sudden you have
25 million followers, like damn,

1325
01:17:13,220 --> 01:17:16,310
but this goes also okay,
what she do quit that job.

1326
01:17:16,850 --> 01:17:18,230
Definitely not cause then
when is she going to say,

1327
01:17:18,231 --> 01:17:22,030
well I'll do the right thing and work at
the library. I'm not saying it's just,

1328
01:17:22,610 --> 01:17:25,010
I mean if it was my kid, I'd
be like, you know, sweetie,

1329
01:17:25,011 --> 01:17:27,210
you might want to weigh out
the economics on this. Right?

1330
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:29,840
I think you said something
really important.

1331
01:17:30,260 --> 01:17:35,260
It's a whole new thing
and I think however,

1332
01:17:35,660 --> 01:17:38,210
it's sort of like the communication.
You're always having, which is well,

1333
01:17:38,211 --> 01:17:42,800
what is success? And
for me it's, that's all.

1334
01:17:42,830 --> 01:17:45,530
It's like getting people,
encouraging them, whatever that is,

1335
01:17:45,531 --> 01:17:47,990
whatever that looks like.
You know,

1336
01:17:47,991 --> 01:17:52,130
you said this like Oh you do the show
whether anyone was listening or not most

1337
01:17:52,131 --> 01:17:56,090
likely, right? I mean until you couldn't
afford it anymore, let's just say.

1338
01:17:56,091 --> 01:17:59,630
But obviously I would do it just
to have the conversations, right.

1339
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:03,390
Maybe I wouldn't do it as much,
but I would definitely do it if I,

1340
01:18:03,530 --> 01:18:05,340
like if someone said, hey, you know,

1341
01:18:05,341 --> 01:18:08,580
every few months a physicists will come
in here and sit down with you for three

1342
01:18:08,581 --> 01:18:10,380
hours about,
yeah let's do it.

1343
01:18:11,310 --> 01:18:15,420
Yeah. Well you're bringing information
to you and learning to you. So for you,

1344
01:18:15,421 --> 01:18:17,100
part of your definition,
that success.

1345
01:18:17,730 --> 01:18:21,600
And so I guess that is the conversation
cause we always have this thing that's

1346
01:18:21,601 --> 01:18:26,370
obvious thing of like successes. It
either his notoriety, it's power,

1347
01:18:26,371 --> 01:18:31,371
it's money and then we forget those other
communications about like the pursuit

1348
01:18:32,311 --> 01:18:34,530
of something that really
genuinely turns you on.

1349
01:18:34,730 --> 01:18:38,930
Well I think people get short sided
and you definitely can get success.

1350
01:18:38,931 --> 01:18:40,070
We just have money.

1351
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:44,330
And you just have objects and you have
notoriety and people view it as success.

1352
01:18:44,630 --> 01:18:47,390
But if you're not doing what you love,
it's not pure success.

1353
01:18:47,420 --> 01:18:48,830
It's a different kind of success.

1354
01:18:48,831 --> 01:18:53,000
Like if you really find something that
you enjoy doing and then you take that

1355
01:18:53,030 --> 01:18:57,680
like layered has with surfing or many
people have with their passions and then

1356
01:18:57,681 --> 01:19:00,990
you become successful through that. It's
a different existence because it's an,

1357
01:19:01,190 --> 01:19:02,570
it's a pure existence.

1358
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:07,720
Like when I do stand up comedy or if I
do see like a commentary for the UFC,

1359
01:19:10,430 --> 01:19:14,020
it's uh, a very, it's a pure enthusiasm.

1360
01:19:14,330 --> 01:19:18,980
It's genuine and I don't have to
fake it. It's, I enjoy doing it.

1361
01:19:19,490 --> 01:19:23,400
That's to me, I don't, I know
everybody can't do that. No.

1362
01:19:23,470 --> 01:19:26,210
Or everybody feels like they can't do
that or they haven't figured out a way to

1363
01:19:26,211 --> 01:19:30,530
do that yet. Right. But if you can, if you
can, if there's a thing that you can do,

1364
01:19:30,531 --> 01:19:33,290
like maybe I would have made more
money if I went into the stock market.

1365
01:19:33,320 --> 01:19:36,810
Maybe have made more money if I was
a banker. Maybe. I don't know. Right.

1366
01:19:36,860 --> 01:19:39,470
But I definitely wouldn't be as happy.
There's no way.

1367
01:19:39,471 --> 01:19:42,830
If I'm the same person I am now and
I was in a fucking office all day,

1368
01:19:42,831 --> 01:19:45,020
making a hundred times as much money,
I'd be miserable.

1369
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:46,420
Right.
And I think that,

1370
01:19:46,450 --> 01:19:49,840
I guess for me that's maybe when I see
the thing with the girls and like I said,

1371
01:19:49,850 --> 01:19:53,620
feeling sensitive to it because I have
daughters or just young people in general.

1372
01:19:53,621 --> 01:19:56,980
It's that conversation of like,
you know,

1373
01:19:57,190 --> 01:20:00,700
just keeping that definition of
success open. And by the way,

1374
01:20:00,701 --> 01:20:02,800
this other path that taking it,

1375
01:20:02,801 --> 01:20:06,910
like following your own
instincts or desires or passions,

1376
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:10,860
there's elements to that that are,
our heart are harder for sure.

1377
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:15,030
It's more unknown. You can feel insecure.
Like is this the right thing to do?

1378
01:20:15,290 --> 01:20:16,123
I mean we've gone,

1379
01:20:16,170 --> 01:20:19,710
I mean in our house we've gone through
that 50 different times, you know,

1380
01:20:19,711 --> 01:20:22,290
it's like I'm going to do
this cause I really want to,

1381
01:20:22,410 --> 01:20:24,090
I don't know what's going to happen.
Right.

1382
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:26,610
And I don't know if it's going to be
successful. I might even lose money.

1383
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:27,473
Who knows?

1384
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:32,550
But that once you start to do
it or you do it once or twice,

1385
01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:36,240
then you go, oh, but it's so worth trying.

1386
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:38,050
If you can pull it off.
That's the thing.

1387
01:20:38,170 --> 01:20:41,710
Like if everything worth
doing is hard to do,

1388
01:20:41,750 --> 01:20:45,500
do everything and,
but by the way you might pursue,

1389
01:20:45,830 --> 01:20:50,030
we've pursued 10 businesses
and like one is soup,

1390
01:20:50,090 --> 01:20:54,950
really thriving, two are doing
well and the rest like we ate it,

1391
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:58,130
we ate it in cash, we
ate it in time, we did.

1392
01:20:58,131 --> 01:21:02,810
So I think that's the other thing
that's important is like, Hey, uh,

1393
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:06,080
you know, it's like sports.
How many times, you know,

1394
01:21:06,380 --> 01:21:11,120
do you lose to you? You lose a lot.
Um, in order to win. And I think,

1395
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:15,890
I think that's something that for me,
like with my girls it's like,

1396
01:21:16,700 --> 01:21:20,160
hey, just try to work really
hard and hear your own voice and,

1397
01:21:20,470 --> 01:21:24,770
and follow that if you can. And
it is scary. I think it's scary.

1398
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:29,960
We are also a person who's
had that opinion reinforce
through vigorous work over

1399
01:21:30,581 --> 01:21:34,360
the years. I mean your,
your uh, your, uh, your, uh,

1400
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:37,000
super successful competitive athlete,

1401
01:21:37,210 --> 01:21:39,490
which is one of the most difficult
things for a person to do,

1402
01:21:39,491 --> 01:21:43,090
to like force your body to perform
better than everybody else's.

1403
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:44,650
Figure a way to win,

1404
01:21:44,770 --> 01:21:49,010
figure a way to get points scored figure
way where all these other people who

1405
01:21:49,020 --> 01:21:51,580
are also high level athletes are
trying to stop you from doing it,

1406
01:21:51,670 --> 01:21:54,040
figuring out a way to succeed
and you're going to fucking fail.

1407
01:21:54,041 --> 01:21:56,770
There's no way around it.
You're going to have ups and downs,

1408
01:21:56,920 --> 01:22:01,060
but you're gonna understand the value
of pursuit of dedication and discipline

1409
01:22:01,210 --> 01:22:03,550
and your kids are going to see that.
It's like they,

1410
01:22:03,580 --> 01:22:06,400
they must know their mom is a bad ass.

1411
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:10,990
No, I don't know. Kind of
understand who you are. Yes and no.

1412
01:22:10,991 --> 01:22:14,350
I think it's interesting cause then
you know like how sons can push against

1413
01:22:14,420 --> 01:22:19,150
Dad's dad's identities,
right? Sure. There's times,

1414
01:22:19,151 --> 01:22:21,730
not my youngest and last,
my oldest,

1415
01:22:21,731 --> 01:22:24,880
but my middle went through a phase
where it was like, she was almost like,

1416
01:22:25,210 --> 01:22:29,770
I'm gonna,
I'm gonna Knock her off her high horse,

1417
01:22:29,860 --> 01:22:33,580
a know like my,
my real estate that I,

1418
01:22:33,581 --> 01:22:38,500
that was my real estate. And it's
like, um, and you know, she's a big,

1419
01:22:38,501 --> 01:22:41,950
strong kid and, but then she, I think
she realized like, oh no, no, no,

1420
01:22:41,951 --> 01:22:45,460
this is more about me
finding my own real estate.

1421
01:22:45,790 --> 01:22:50,770
Like my mom did that because that was
what my mom had to do and what she was

1422
01:22:50,771 --> 01:22:55,510
good at. And that was my thing. And it
was, but there was a minute that I think,

1423
01:22:55,900 --> 01:22:59,980
listen, no kid looks at their parent
that they actually live with by the way,

1424
01:23:00,700 --> 01:23:05,440
and is like, yeah, they're
cool. There's just no,

1425
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:09,310
I mean, like if I deserted them and called
like four times a year, they'd be like,

1426
01:23:09,460 --> 01:23:13,810
it's my mom. She's on the phone and she's
an exotic country. They're like, Yo,

1427
01:23:13,811 --> 01:23:16,210
get me some water. I'm going to
bed. Like, you know, it's like,

1428
01:23:16,211 --> 01:23:19,600
it's no different in any
house. And by the way, I,

1429
01:23:20,580 --> 01:23:23,350
I have this new thing I'm doing right
now with my youngest daughter cause she

1430
01:23:23,351 --> 01:23:27,040
can get me, like, she can get
me like nobody's business.
Like Laird always jokes,

1431
01:23:27,041 --> 01:23:29,740
he goes, you two are not allowed to
drive in the car together anymore.

1432
01:23:30,010 --> 01:23:33,550
Like we come home from one ride from
school and I'm on the mats. Right.

1433
01:23:33,551 --> 01:23:37,150
This kid is like, cause we're very
similar and she just works me.

1434
01:23:37,151 --> 01:23:41,080
And then she work. He was just you
and her alone of course. Oh No.

1435
01:23:41,081 --> 01:23:45,460
Especially she's no dummy. This
kid is so smart. We always joke,

1436
01:23:45,530 --> 01:23:48,810
I like Brody will run something. I
just want her to have friends. Uh,

1437
01:23:48,940 --> 01:23:50,320
hopefully you know that she's,

1438
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:53,980
she's pretty radical and she always gives
you this look to while she's carving

1439
01:23:53,981 --> 01:23:57,730
you up. That took a slight
smirk on her face and I'm like,

1440
01:23:57,731 --> 01:24:02,530
I'm gonna kill this kid. You know? And
so, and then you think I'm, I'm, you know,

1441
01:24:02,531 --> 01:24:07,060
I'm, I've been around, I'm trying to be
evolved and I don't think I'm having a,

1442
01:24:07,110 --> 01:24:10,000
you know, insulin spike. Like
I should be balanced and calm.

1443
01:24:10,001 --> 01:24:13,130
I think I meditated this morning and
I'm like four seconds. And I'm like,

1444
01:24:13,350 --> 01:24:14,183
you know,
the console

1445
01:24:18,300 --> 01:24:20,470
becomes a little sport for
him too. Yeah. So now, okay,

1446
01:24:20,471 --> 01:24:23,350
so this is the best is so I go,
okay.

1447
01:24:23,380 --> 01:24:25,390
I layered was telling me
this story years ago, he got,

1448
01:24:25,450 --> 01:24:30,450
he went down a river raft down a river
and went down the rapids and got pinned

1449
01:24:30,970 --> 01:24:32,140
against the rock.
Okay.

1450
01:24:33,220 --> 01:24:36,400
And it was breaking on his back and
he said he was pushing on the rock and

1451
01:24:36,401 --> 01:24:39,790
pushing, couldn't get off. Okay.

1452
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:43,930
And he said he had this image of like
a skeleton, like on the Rock, you know,

1453
01:24:43,931 --> 01:24:45,760
like with the water, just
pounding on it, you know,

1454
01:24:45,761 --> 01:24:48,430
it's like the clothes all
messed up and he said he,

1455
01:24:48,820 --> 01:24:52,990
he moved his foot if wiggled his
foot and his whole body slipped out.

1456
01:24:53,980 --> 01:24:57,040
And so I said,
when I see my youngest daughter,

1457
01:24:58,780 --> 01:25:03,250
I'm going to wiggle my foot because I
keep pushing and prodding and cheese just

1458
01:25:03,251 --> 01:25:06,680
coming, you know, she's a hydraulic,
like it's not stopping, it's not UNCC.

1459
01:25:06,710 --> 01:25:10,360
Like she's younger than me.
She has more energy.

1460
01:25:11,140 --> 01:25:14,560
She's faster. I mean, you know, and so
I go, I'm just going to wiggle my foot,

1461
01:25:14,561 --> 01:25:17,920
like literally to the point where
even if I need the physical cue,

1462
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:21,370
like if she's standing there doing some
of her weird bullshit, I'll just be like,

1463
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:24,690
move my foot just to give them a trigger.
Like I've got a trigger myself,

1464
01:25:24,970 --> 01:25:28,180
I'm a parent, I'm like against the
ropes like everybody else. And so,

1465
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:33,490
and I have a partner who supports me and
sometimes he looks at me like not, not,

1466
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:35,880
not that strong of a game Gab.
And so,

1467
01:25:37,540 --> 01:25:41,060
so you know, we'll, we'll, we'll
get into it and I, and I'll,

1468
01:25:41,220 --> 01:25:43,540
and I'll go to pick her up. And
my whole thing is when, when I,

1469
01:25:43,660 --> 01:25:45,700
I talked to my kids in the morning,
like first thing I always say, hey,

1470
01:25:45,701 --> 01:25:50,470
good morning. Like I try really hard to
be the adult and to be the parent, right?

1471
01:25:50,471 --> 01:25:52,180
Like that's what I'm really want to do.
Like,

1472
01:25:52,181 --> 01:25:56,830
I really want to show up as
the adult and I'm flawed be it.

1473
01:25:56,860 --> 01:26:00,700
I still be like, you know what, I at
least she's acting like an adult that,

1474
01:26:01,030 --> 01:26:04,070
that woman over there, you
know, get me water. And so, uh,

1475
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:07,910
she'll get in the car and I'll be like,
hi honey. How was your day at school?

1476
01:26:07,911 --> 01:26:11,830
You know, I try even though look, the
fake nice tone and everything. Yeah,

1477
01:26:11,930 --> 01:26:14,330
I don't really, you know, listen,
I spent almost seven hours there.

1478
01:26:14,331 --> 01:26:17,540
I really don't want to talk about school.
It's like a colossal waste of time.

1479
01:26:18,100 --> 01:26:21,440
How old is she? 11. She's like,
and then she says to me yesterday,

1480
01:26:21,441 --> 01:26:25,910
I'm not exaggerating. She goes,
you know, and if you listen,
no one fence. I'm sorry,

1481
01:26:25,911 --> 01:26:28,910
my mother trying to be rude.
I just, I, if you can't tell,

1482
01:26:28,911 --> 01:26:30,050
I don't like to talk that much.

1483
01:26:30,051 --> 01:26:33,590
It seems like a waste of time talking
as always to us. What she says,

1484
01:26:34,100 --> 01:26:37,130
she's very self contained and I'm
thinking through that, but okay.

1485
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:41,300
So then I'm like, all right, well another
strategy. So I go, oh, that's cool.

1486
01:26:41,300 --> 01:26:44,300
I can be self contained. Like, I'm
cool, I don't need to beg. Oh Sweetie,

1487
01:26:44,301 --> 01:26:48,650
I don't care. No problem. I just click
over a little bit into my mail like, okay,

1488
01:26:48,651 --> 01:26:52,340
if I can drive this car and maybe I'm
going to drive a little faster and like

1489
01:26:52,370 --> 01:26:57,370
let's go and within three minutes somehow
all the things I said I wasn't going

1490
01:26:58,351 --> 01:27:02,780
to get lured into nothing.
I'm going to wiggle my foot,

1491
01:27:02,781 --> 01:27:06,170
all of this like philosophical stuff.
I've been reading books,

1492
01:27:07,430 --> 01:27:08,263
she gets me

1493
01:27:10,240 --> 01:27:13,070
and she's like 95 pounds and she gets me.

1494
01:27:13,910 --> 01:27:17,660
She's my only kid that gets me like
this and it's literally like if you went

1495
01:27:17,661 --> 01:27:20,130
into a restaurant and you said,
okay, I'm not going to order it.

1496
01:27:20,131 --> 01:27:24,590
A little design yet and the hamburger
and the double fries with the chili sauce

1497
01:27:24,591 --> 01:27:26,930
and you walk in and you go,
I'll take a little design.

1498
01:27:26,930 --> 01:27:27,860
You have the hamburger and the,

1499
01:27:28,010 --> 01:27:32,120
it's like the one thing I said I wasn't
going to do and she gets me every time.

1500
01:27:32,121 --> 01:27:37,100
So that's something I'm always
really trying to figure out.

1501
01:27:37,190 --> 01:27:42,020
And also like a survey back away
from I, this lady, actually,

1502
01:27:42,021 --> 01:27:44,760
you should have her on your show. Have
you ever heard of Byron Katie? No.

1503
01:27:44,870 --> 01:27:48,350
You got to get her, Jamie, you got to get
her. She's, she taught me a lot of stuff,

1504
01:27:48,351 --> 01:27:52,490
but it's basically like full and men
do this better generally and yes,

1505
01:27:52,491 --> 01:27:54,920
there are women that do it as well as men.
I'm not getting into all that,

1506
01:27:54,921 --> 01:27:59,921
but it's like surrendering like
maybe my kids gonna grow up

1507
01:28:02,090 --> 01:28:06,170
and they're going to be completely
different than what I thought or what they

1508
01:28:06,171 --> 01:28:09,470
would be or my expectations.
Um,

1509
01:28:10,250 --> 01:28:14,510
and that's actually probably
closer to the real, the real thing.

1510
01:28:14,510 --> 01:28:17,630
So I can be that, you know, going
through sports, I was like, man,

1511
01:28:17,631 --> 01:28:20,960
volleyball is way easier than
this. It is. It's just very,

1512
01:28:20,961 --> 01:28:23,540
it's cause it's straight forward.
Take the ball, hit the line,

1513
01:28:24,260 --> 01:28:29,210
take the ball and hit the other line. Oh,
okay. No, that was, did you complete that?

1514
01:28:29,211 --> 01:28:31,370
No, I didn't hit the line.
Okay. You hit the line.

1515
01:28:31,430 --> 01:28:35,240
Is your 11 year old involved in
sports? Oh yeah, the worst sport ever.

1516
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:37,040
What's four horses?

1517
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:42,840
It's like beauty pageants on big animals
were parents don't think it's cute to

1518
01:28:44,181 --> 01:28:46,580
take six year olds and think, oh
it's so sweet. We'll get them,

1519
01:28:47,330 --> 01:28:48,530
we'll go ride horses.

1520
01:28:48,531 --> 01:28:51,800
Cause then they fall in love with horses
and then they want better horses and

1521
01:28:51,801 --> 01:28:56,801
then they want and pretty horse pants
and then the boots and his the deep it'll

1522
01:28:58,251 --> 01:29:02,310
kill you. She, I have to say to her,
I'm sorry you not born to billionaires.

1523
01:29:02,550 --> 01:29:06,030
I'm really so sorry for you.
It's pretty heavy.

1524
01:29:06,031 --> 01:29:11,031
My middle daughter is into tennis and
she's pursuing tennis and I'm trying to

1525
01:29:12,451 --> 01:29:15,360
figure out how to manipulate my
young one out of away from horses.

1526
01:29:15,540 --> 01:29:16,410
And she'll say to me,

1527
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:20,990
I know you think it's a phase and
it's not going to make it a not phase.

1528
01:29:20,991 --> 01:29:22,440
And she's,
and that's why I'm like no,

1529
01:29:22,441 --> 01:29:24,810
do whatever you want but you have to use
your own body at least a couple of days

1530
01:29:24,811 --> 01:29:26,940
a week. I go, cause you're using the
body of the horse. And by the way,

1531
01:29:26,941 --> 01:29:30,270
doesn't it frustrate you? I even tried
this. I can't believe I'm admitting this.

1532
01:29:32,540 --> 01:29:35,340
I mean I thought you guys
loved the animals. You know,

1533
01:29:35,341 --> 01:29:38,640
like you really loved horses and what
you're doing to them is not good for the

1534
01:29:38,641 --> 01:29:43,530
horses. They land on the same foot and
she's like, they jumped in nature. I go,

1535
01:29:43,590 --> 01:29:46,130
they don't, not with a hundred pounds
on their back. They don't, and not,

1536
01:29:46,170 --> 01:29:48,840
they don't land on the same leg. I've
tried that. I can't do that anymore.

1537
01:29:48,841 --> 01:29:53,610
That's not fair. And
then, um, I oh I totally,

1538
01:29:53,611 --> 01:29:55,710
and then the other thing I've tried is,
um,

1539
01:29:56,740 --> 01:30:01,740
doesn't irritate you if you are on a
horse and you were more talented as an

1540
01:30:01,861 --> 01:30:05,310
athlete or you had trained harder but
your horse was in as good so you couldn't

1541
01:30:05,311 --> 01:30:06,144
win.

1542
01:30:07,770 --> 01:30:11,590
And she just looks at me like I'm going
to ride this out. She doesn't care.

1543
01:30:11,670 --> 01:30:14,520
It's nothing impacts her.
Cause that's what frustrates me.

1544
01:30:14,521 --> 01:30:19,050
Imagine if it was like I had a better
guy than you so I could kick your ass.

1545
01:30:19,050 --> 01:30:23,580
And you know, Jujitsu cause Mikey
was more expensive. You'd be like,

1546
01:30:23,640 --> 01:30:26,940
wait a second,
I trained twice as hard as you.

1547
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:30,630
I've been doing it longer and maybe
I'm just better than you. Nope.

1548
01:30:30,730 --> 01:30:33,240
Mikey's more expensive.
So if you have a shitty horse,

1549
01:30:34,210 --> 01:30:38,220
there's nothing you can do about it. And
the judges know, they know. They know.

1550
01:30:38,370 --> 01:30:43,020
So yeah, I would never get into
that. And I don't come from that.

1551
01:30:43,021 --> 01:30:45,060
I barely come from like if
I didn't hit a white ball,

1552
01:30:45,061 --> 01:30:48,840
I wasn't going even going to the
university, nevermind. Like you know,

1553
01:30:49,290 --> 01:30:54,210
this whole horse world
thing. God, I found myself,

1554
01:30:54,211 --> 01:30:58,530
I went to a show once and I was like
saying good morning to all the groomsmen.

1555
01:30:58,590 --> 01:31:03,510
Like good morning sir. Good afternoon and
like giving stink guide all the ladies,

1556
01:31:03,750 --> 01:31:07,320
you know, I was like, yeah, this is
an upside down here. Different thing.

1557
01:31:08,610 --> 01:31:13,170
Yeah. I just, I I really, this is one
of my, I lose sleep over this show.

1558
01:31:13,350 --> 01:31:14,940
Really? Yeah, I do. I do.

1559
01:31:15,950 --> 01:31:19,080
[inaudible] [inaudible] it's a lot
of money and that's not the part,

1560
01:31:19,081 --> 01:31:22,230
I mean I lose sleep over that too cause
I'm like, Larry's going to kill me. But,

1561
01:31:22,260 --> 01:31:26,430
um, because then the flip side of it
is I got a kid who's into something.

1562
01:31:26,460 --> 01:31:29,450
She'll go to the barn if she, if
you let her seven, eight hours,

1563
01:31:29,451 --> 01:31:32,640
she'll work with the horses, lunge him,
do all this stuff. So then you're like,

1564
01:31:32,641 --> 01:31:33,720
okay,
well she's into something.

1565
01:31:33,721 --> 01:31:38,700
This is not a kid who will sit around
and not do anything. But I just,

1566
01:31:38,701 --> 01:31:43,230
I guess for me it's the, you know, it's,

1567
01:31:43,710 --> 01:31:48,260
it's the, it's the money sport, you
know, take that weird bubble thing,

1568
01:31:48,760 --> 01:31:53,650
you know, so that, that part
was like, I was like, Oh God,
how did we get here? Yeah.

1569
01:31:54,040 --> 01:31:56,400
Yeah. That's what my friend is
dealing with, with his daughter.

1570
01:31:56,401 --> 01:32:00,870
How old is his daughter? She's
10. Oh, is he in deep already did,

1571
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:05,830
is he Lisa Horace? Yeah. Got a horse.
They ha they bought a horse. Okay.

1572
01:32:05,831 --> 01:32:09,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I didn't know
you could lose the horse brokers.

1573
01:32:09,490 --> 01:32:12,100
There's a whole thing of size.
It's a shyster Mary hold trip.

1574
01:32:12,420 --> 01:32:15,040
It's super expensive to Lisa horse too,
right?

1575
01:32:15,430 --> 01:32:18,130
I think it's like 40 grand a month
or something crazy. That's like,

1576
01:32:18,160 --> 01:32:20,500
well then you've got a really fancy horse,

1577
01:32:20,501 --> 01:32:23,670
but it's expensive and made that
number up. Yeah, you did. And then

1578
01:32:25,330 --> 01:32:29,590
that's like bill gates daughter's
home. But then it's like, I dunno,

1579
01:32:29,710 --> 01:32:33,970
for me that's it. But again, as a parent
I have, these are one more of my lessons.

1580
01:32:33,971 --> 01:32:38,750
Like I'm not her and she's
not me. And I have, uh, I,

1581
01:32:39,340 --> 01:32:43,330
as much as I used to think I was
so in charge of so many things.

1582
01:32:45,290 --> 01:32:45,610
Yeah.

1583
01:32:45,610 --> 01:32:47,500
You know,
I think being in a long relationship,

1584
01:32:47,501 --> 01:32:51,280
I've been with Laird almost 24 years.
It's like you start to learn like,

1585
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:56,710
oh, okay, I'm, I'm not, I can impact you.

1586
01:32:56,711 --> 01:33:00,700
I can influence you. I can
support you. I can love you. Um,

1587
01:33:01,480 --> 01:33:05,830
I could try to inspire
you, but, uh, not here to,

1588
01:33:06,110 --> 01:33:09,220
it's like even as a parent,
like I am not here to control anyone.

1589
01:33:09,370 --> 01:33:12,190
And that's a hard thing. Cause when
you get a little baby, you control,

1590
01:33:12,191 --> 01:33:14,140
you're in charge.
That's what you needed to be.

1591
01:33:14,530 --> 01:33:18,580
And then all of a sudden it's like, oh
yeah, no. And that shift is they don't,

1592
01:33:18,790 --> 01:33:21,820
I wish people need to talk
more about like the shift of,

1593
01:33:22,090 --> 01:33:26,440
cause we're not objective
and, uh, you know,

1594
01:33:26,620 --> 01:33:29,590
the tools that you need.
You got to keep adding tools and it's,

1595
01:33:31,020 --> 01:33:31,800
it's very humbling.

1596
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:36,170
Do you find it easier to
do on [inaudible] or at,

1597
01:33:36,450 --> 01:33:39,900
in California? Cause any different?
Well it depends, right? So if I have a,

1598
01:33:39,990 --> 01:33:43,550
my middle daughter who's
a teenager not on Kohai,

1599
01:33:44,040 --> 01:33:47,910
she looks 18 or 19 and uh, you
know, there's not a lot to do.

1600
01:33:48,870 --> 01:33:53,700
And uh, so that's tricky. They're here.

1601
01:33:53,730 --> 01:33:57,210
Like she, she basically lives
at a tennis house and she goes,

1602
01:33:57,270 --> 01:33:59,820
she's homeschooled and she does
five to seven hours of tennis.

1603
01:34:00,030 --> 01:34:03,150
Her choice as of in the
last couple of months.

1604
01:34:03,720 --> 01:34:08,310
So it's easier cause there's just
more productive things to do. Um,

1605
01:34:08,430 --> 01:34:12,660
what I like is when they're little
[inaudible] great because it's so simple.

1606
01:34:12,810 --> 01:34:13,860
Life is simple.

1607
01:34:14,130 --> 01:34:18,420
So what kids are thinking about is like
playing and being in nature and like

1608
01:34:18,510 --> 01:34:23,510
developing also a toughness to them that
maybe like city kids have it different

1609
01:34:24,860 --> 01:34:27,690
cause like they're barefoot and they're
like climbing trees and they're throwing

1610
01:34:27,691 --> 01:34:30,660
rocks at each other and it's just
like a little more rough and tumble.

1611
01:34:31,530 --> 01:34:33,630
So when they're little
[inaudible] he certainly easier.

1612
01:34:34,350 --> 01:34:37,190
And then as they get older, that's
what we're, where we're sort of at now.

1613
01:34:37,210 --> 01:34:42,090
It's like you got to adapt and put
these kids, give them a launching pad,

1614
01:34:42,720 --> 01:34:45,090
if you will, because
a, the problem is like,

1615
01:34:45,091 --> 01:34:46,710
and I went through
growing up in an island,

1616
01:34:46,711 --> 01:34:51,711
it's like you don't know all that's
out there to dream to do and it's,

1617
01:34:53,310 --> 01:34:55,260
even if it's, you know,
everything in life,

1618
01:34:55,261 --> 01:34:57,410
it's so true about like
being like the alchemists.

1619
01:34:57,411 --> 01:34:59,840
Like I even see it with layered,
it's like he went out into the world,

1620
01:34:59,841 --> 01:35:02,930
he's done all this stuff and there are
certain things we're doing in projects

1621
01:35:02,931 --> 01:35:05,330
right back on Nicole [inaudible] and,

1622
01:35:05,350 --> 01:35:09,020
and so there's always going to
be that element probably of um,

1623
01:35:09,110 --> 01:35:12,770
I went and I did all these things.
I express myself all these ways.

1624
01:35:12,771 --> 01:35:17,771
And then there's some basic parts about
where I exactly started that are still

1625
01:35:18,051 --> 01:35:21,200
really important to me. But I think
it's important for kids to see,

1626
01:35:21,201 --> 01:35:24,770
like it doesn't matter where
you're from or how you grew up.

1627
01:35:24,771 --> 01:35:27,770
Like certainly Laird and I both
the same way. It's like you,

1628
01:35:27,860 --> 01:35:31,880
you really could try to do anything and,

1629
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:36,050
and pursued that if it's in you,
if it's genuinely in you and calling you.

1630
01:35:36,051 --> 01:35:39,380
And I want that for my kids and
I don't care what that is. Um,

1631
01:35:39,410 --> 01:35:41,450
but just that they have something that
they get up each day and they're like, Yo,

1632
01:35:41,451 --> 01:35:42,284
I'm turned on.

1633
01:35:42,460 --> 01:35:46,240
Yeah. That really is what people need to
really need. Something they love doing.

1634
01:35:46,600 --> 01:35:47,081
That's it.

1635
01:35:47,081 --> 01:35:50,290
And I think that's when I was talking
about success is sometimes we have all

1636
01:35:50,291 --> 01:35:51,750
this,
you know,

1637
01:35:51,790 --> 01:35:55,720
kind of bells and whistles and
attention around getting attention.

1638
01:35:56,380 --> 01:35:59,500
And I think people don't realize
that getting attention. I mean,

1639
01:35:59,501 --> 01:36:02,080
you know this for yourself.
It's like, yeah, it's great,

1640
01:36:02,081 --> 01:36:04,300
but what is it like what does it really?

1641
01:36:04,301 --> 01:36:06,730
And when you close the doors and you're
hanging with your people that are,

1642
01:36:06,731 --> 01:36:07,960
you're close to,
it's like,

1643
01:36:09,370 --> 01:36:14,370
you know what's making you excited
for real and who loves you for real?

1644
01:36:15,431 --> 01:36:17,860
And that way of like,
it's great if people appreciate your work.

1645
01:36:17,861 --> 01:36:21,700
That always feels good. But if you're
doing it for your real reasons,

1646
01:36:21,730 --> 01:36:26,350
then I already think
that is a real success.

1647
01:36:26,440 --> 01:36:29,080
Um,
and we spent a lot of time working,

1648
01:36:29,620 --> 01:36:32,980
so why not have something
that we're fired up on?

1649
01:36:33,130 --> 01:36:35,770
And that's the thing because it's like,
you know,

1650
01:36:36,550 --> 01:36:40,390
you spent a long time of your life
working. What do you want to do?

1651
01:36:40,650 --> 01:36:41,041
Yeah.

1652
01:36:41,041 --> 01:36:46,041
That and then guiding a child into that
direction of trying to set them up in a

1653
01:36:46,111 --> 01:36:51,111
way that they view their life as kind of
a project and the most enjoyment you're

1654
01:36:52,411 --> 01:36:56,700
going to get as find a thing that excites
you to find the thing that you really

1655
01:36:56,701 --> 01:37:00,210
get inspired by some the
whatever the fuck it is,

1656
01:37:00,211 --> 01:37:01,830
it's going to be different
for you than it is for me.

1657
01:37:02,100 --> 01:37:04,350
They've got to find out what that
thing is, but it's all the same thing.

1658
01:37:04,351 --> 01:37:08,730
Once you find out what the thing is and
that that thing genuinely gels with your

1659
01:37:08,731 --> 01:37:13,400
personality and your likes
and your passion, just run
with it. You can do it. Yeah,

1660
01:37:13,440 --> 01:37:14,360
you can run with it and it

1661
01:37:14,360 --> 01:37:19,190
changes too. I think that's the other
thing is also we get defined like, okay,

1662
01:37:19,191 --> 01:37:23,930
you were doing this one job and then
it's like, okay, but that job is over.

1663
01:37:24,260 --> 01:37:27,130
Like it's like being an athlete
or an, you know, a Pr, you know,

1664
01:37:27,170 --> 01:37:32,170
competing competitive athlete on an
organized platform that has it a day and a

1665
01:37:32,661 --> 01:37:34,430
time.
And then when that's over,

1666
01:37:34,850 --> 01:37:39,650
do you want to look back and keep talking
about that or do you want to look and

1667
01:37:39,651 --> 01:37:42,990
see who you are now and who you'd like
to be? And I think that that's always a,

1668
01:37:43,060 --> 01:37:47,060
you know, kind of an important thing to
teach people, especially people that have,

1669
01:37:47,690 --> 01:37:51,860
well I'm, I'm a comedian, I
was a professional athlete.
It's like, okay, that's cool.

1670
01:37:52,010 --> 01:37:54,860
I had some guy coming to
me once and say, Hey, I'm,

1671
01:37:56,370 --> 01:37:57,690
I was at the golf course and I was,

1672
01:37:57,691 --> 01:37:59,790
one of my kids were hitting golf
balls and he goes, where are you?

1673
01:37:59,790 --> 01:38:04,440
That volleyball player Gabby? And I was
like, oh well no, I'm, I'm still Gabby.

1674
01:38:06,060 --> 01:38:09,000
But one of the things I've
done is play volleyball.

1675
01:38:09,330 --> 01:38:12,390
And I think that that actually, if we
can get to that, that's even better.

1676
01:38:12,391 --> 01:38:17,280
It's like who am I?
And then off of this non,

1677
01:38:17,730 --> 01:38:18,210
you know,

1678
01:38:18,210 --> 01:38:23,210
as far as like whether you're older or
younger or in one part of your career or

1679
01:38:23,251 --> 01:38:26,400
not, it's like you still can
always be the essence of yourself.

1680
01:38:26,430 --> 01:38:29,010
And then it's like, oh, and now,

1681
01:38:29,011 --> 01:38:33,180
right now I'm doing this and that.
And I was, you know, but I'm not,

1682
01:38:33,660 --> 01:38:35,370
I'm not for all time. Just, you know,

1683
01:38:35,430 --> 01:38:37,860
a volleyball player fighters
have a huge problem with that.

1684
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:42,390
They identify as being fighters so much
that once they retire, they almost,

1685
01:38:42,750 --> 01:38:46,440
almost all of them,
except for a small percentage,

1686
01:38:46,890 --> 01:38:50,490
almost all of them come back because
they just, they miss it so much.

1687
01:38:50,490 --> 01:38:53,190
They miss the excitement and the thrill
and they don't know who they are.

1688
01:38:53,191 --> 01:38:56,310
Without that pursuit,
the pursuit is the next fight.

1689
01:38:56,311 --> 01:38:58,770
The F pursued his training
camp getting ready.

1690
01:38:59,310 --> 01:39:01,020
And when they don't have
that for a long time,

1691
01:39:01,021 --> 01:39:04,230
it just starts really chipping away
at them. Well, and I think too,

1692
01:39:04,410 --> 01:39:09,410
the amount of focus it takes to be really
good at that kind of stuff or to run a

1693
01:39:09,841 --> 01:39:11,070
company or anything.

1694
01:39:11,840 --> 01:39:16,840
It makes sense why it's so hard to try
to diversify while you're doing that.

1695
01:39:17,310 --> 01:39:18,210
It is really hard.

1696
01:39:18,211 --> 01:39:22,290
But I think it's important to quietly
keep that voice inside your head going,

1697
01:39:22,470 --> 01:39:24,490
yeah, but who are you, um,

1698
01:39:25,080 --> 01:39:29,370
beyond that expression of
yourself? Who are you, what do you,

1699
01:39:29,400 --> 01:39:31,360
how do you feel about things?
Um,

1700
01:39:31,470 --> 01:39:34,560
and also the opportunity like
to kind of grow up, you know,

1701
01:39:34,561 --> 01:39:39,150
there's so many opportunities, like
30, 40, 50 like to try to try to,

1702
01:39:39,151 --> 01:39:43,860
and I don't mean grow up in the notion
of like you're so responsible now.

1703
01:39:44,250 --> 01:39:47,280
I mean like grow up in a
way that like maybe you,

1704
01:39:47,790 --> 01:39:52,550
you change your ideas and the way you
do things. And you know, I was talking,

1705
01:39:52,560 --> 01:39:56,520
I was telling Larry,
I was in this situation this week where I,

1706
01:39:56,580 --> 01:39:59,400
something had gone down.
I didn't like the way it had gone down.

1707
01:40:00,270 --> 01:40:03,330
It wasn't to do with him. And
I was like, you know what, I'm,

1708
01:40:04,110 --> 01:40:07,350
I'm not going to attach to
this. Like I, I know better.

1709
01:40:07,380 --> 01:40:12,380
So now I'm just going to notice that
it kind of bugs me and I'm not going to

1710
01:40:14,190 --> 01:40:17,250
attach all the way to that feeling
and to that experience. And I,

1711
01:40:17,251 --> 01:40:21,180
and for me that's more what I mean about
growing up, not like being, you know,

1712
01:40:21,181 --> 01:40:21,581
grown up.

1713
01:40:21,581 --> 01:40:24,930
Because I actually think that the more
grown up we are also means we could

1714
01:40:24,931 --> 01:40:28,230
probably be more childlike too for sure.
Both.

1715
01:40:28,260 --> 01:40:32,820
So it isn't about like be responsible,
it's just a different freedom.

1716
01:40:32,821 --> 01:40:33,990
So I mean I,

1717
01:40:34,110 --> 01:40:39,110
I would think in the end that that would
be a more interesting quest then I was

1718
01:40:40,051 --> 01:40:43,230
a champion. Anything, I don't know,

1719
01:40:43,231 --> 01:40:46,550
and it's not sexy and it's internal,
but I dunno,

1720
01:40:46,590 --> 01:40:49,140
it's can be I think pretty rich.

1721
01:40:49,240 --> 01:40:53,370
But I think ultimately for a person
who's experienced athletic highs, uh,

1722
01:40:53,500 --> 01:40:54,010
the highs of

1723
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:57,040
accomplishments but also
understands real personal struggle,

1724
01:40:57,460 --> 01:41:00,970
that's when like a person like you, you've
experienced so many different things,

1725
01:41:00,980 --> 01:41:04,390
you can you and understand what's
actually beneficial towards you. Right.

1726
01:41:04,470 --> 01:41:08,280
And it's pretty simple. I hate to,
that's kind of the heavy part. It's like,

1727
01:41:08,430 --> 01:41:13,140
it's like being married to Laird Laird
is once it got to bed at eight 30 and

1728
01:41:13,141 --> 01:41:18,060
Laird wants to get up early and
he keeps it pretty simple. And I,

1729
01:41:18,061 --> 01:41:22,260
it's an interesting thing
because within it there's, um,

1730
01:41:23,080 --> 01:41:23,710
yeah,

1731
01:41:23,710 --> 01:41:25,510
he seems pretty good.
I mean,

1732
01:41:25,511 --> 01:41:29,200
as long as there's sometimes
waves because that guy is like,

1733
01:41:29,260 --> 01:41:32,290
that seems like a,
that's pretty straight forward.

1734
01:41:33,400 --> 01:41:37,660
Well that's it, right? Like how do
I, how do I get the highest ideas,

1735
01:41:37,840 --> 01:41:40,240
the biggest ideas,
you know,

1736
01:41:40,241 --> 01:41:44,530
whether it's like I'm
dealing with ego or whatever,

1737
01:41:45,040 --> 01:41:48,790
get the biggest ideas and then get
everything else pretty stripped down.

1738
01:41:49,090 --> 01:41:52,810
Pretty simple. Yeah.
Because otherwise it just,

1739
01:41:52,840 --> 01:41:55,240
I feel like you're running around and I'm,
I like,

1740
01:41:55,241 --> 01:41:58,150
I love the days I'm running around
and I'm like, what am I reacting to?

1741
01:41:58,151 --> 01:42:02,080
Like what the fuck? Like what do, what is
going on? Like I'm like a crazy person.

1742
01:42:02,170 --> 01:42:07,030
Right. And then it's like, okay, you
know, you got to back it up and it,

1743
01:42:07,031 --> 01:42:10,330
and listen with kids, it's hard because
you're only as good as like your,

1744
01:42:10,990 --> 01:42:14,860
whatever your kids are going through. I
mean, and then there's elements of it,

1745
01:42:14,861 --> 01:42:18,150
like they're going through things and you
go, it's probably pretty natural. Yep.

1746
01:42:18,190 --> 01:42:22,150
Even if it's super hard, it's
like, and that's okay too.

1747
01:42:22,540 --> 01:42:24,810
And you don't want that for
them. But I think, you know,

1748
01:42:24,820 --> 01:42:28,480
that's something I've really
learned is like I had to, God,

1749
01:42:28,481 --> 01:42:31,090
it's a bummer that you have to go
through that and it's hard to watch and I

1750
01:42:31,091 --> 01:42:34,300
don't want you to, and that's
okay too because that's part of,

1751
01:42:35,010 --> 01:42:38,340
it's really cool though to see them come
out in the other end and then talk to

1752
01:42:38,341 --> 01:42:42,600
you about it. Oh, it's not bothering me
so much more. Um, yeah, I get it. Yeah,

1753
01:42:42,601 --> 01:42:44,540
I was just upset,
but I'm all right.

1754
01:42:45,070 --> 01:42:49,810
You know, and it was really cool.
Uh, Dang I learned, cause I, I am,

1755
01:42:50,230 --> 01:42:54,070
you know, listen, I'm
pretty Siri, not Siri.

1756
01:42:54,071 --> 01:42:55,480
I'd say I'm a pretty serious person.

1757
01:42:55,481 --> 01:42:58,960
Like Laird is sort of the lighter
person of the two of us. And I,

1758
01:42:58,990 --> 01:43:03,520
someone sort of gave me some information
about like not resisting with my kids.

1759
01:43:03,521 --> 01:43:06,520
Like my oldest was going
through something and I said,

1760
01:43:06,700 --> 01:43:09,950
I just need to tell you how I feel about
this, but I didn't make it a big deal.

1761
01:43:09,951 --> 01:43:12,010
I just sort of dropped it off
and said, hey, this I'm feeling.

1762
01:43:12,190 --> 01:43:16,000
And she said to me very
clearly when she was like 22,

1763
01:43:17,890 --> 01:43:20,620
uh, I, this just feels like
something I have to do.

1764
01:43:21,940 --> 01:43:26,440
And I remember thinking, I felt like that
and nobody understood what I was doing.

1765
01:43:26,980 --> 01:43:28,120
And I understood I had to,

1766
01:43:28,690 --> 01:43:32,080
something I had to do for my
reasons and I was right for myself.

1767
01:43:32,350 --> 01:43:34,900
And what I did is I just
went, okay, I get it.

1768
01:43:35,290 --> 01:43:39,670
And where I wanted her to end up happen
so much quicker because I didn't put up

1769
01:43:39,671 --> 01:43:42,760
the resistance. And that's
the other thing. I mean,

1770
01:43:44,080 --> 01:43:48,220
how long does it take me to learn
that one? It's like, you know,

1771
01:43:48,280 --> 01:43:52,460
not having to try to resist or navigate
every single situation in disco.

1772
01:43:52,850 --> 01:43:57,680
Okay. And then you get through it so much
faster and they get through it. No, no,

1773
01:43:57,690 --> 01:44:02,330
you're Lord Subaru in nutrition layered
has is you guys have this company

1774
01:44:02,410 --> 01:44:05,720
[inaudible] Laird superfood. Yeah.
De Force has stuff when your kids,

1775
01:44:06,170 --> 01:44:10,010
are you kidding? My kids, if they
want to eat pasta and whatever,

1776
01:44:10,011 --> 01:44:12,320
they can eat whenever they want.
Yeah,

1777
01:44:12,321 --> 01:44:16,160
because I cooked dinner so we know
what dinner looks like. My kids,

1778
01:44:16,161 --> 01:44:20,630
I always say just now, what's the
difference between food and fun? Be Clear.

1779
01:44:20,631 --> 01:44:22,190
Bagel is a lot of fun.

1780
01:44:22,370 --> 01:44:26,120
It's not food because I just want to send
them into the world equipped with the

1781
01:44:26,121 --> 01:44:30,590
information on how they can
take care of themselves.

1782
01:44:30,920 --> 01:44:34,010
Because if you make anything a thing,
don't have that.

1783
01:44:34,011 --> 01:44:37,430
When they go to their friend's house,
they'll have a bag of chips, the clicker,

1784
01:44:37,790 --> 01:44:42,770
and there'll be like, I love it
here. So, um, I am like, yeah,

1785
01:44:42,820 --> 01:44:45,380
whatever you want.
And my kids eat pretty healthy.

1786
01:44:46,700 --> 01:44:48,530
That's awesome that
they listened that way.

1787
01:44:48,590 --> 01:44:53,030
They don't listen well that they've
figured it out, that they eat healthy.

1788
01:44:53,240 --> 01:44:58,000
Smart. We'll also, okay, so my middle
for a minute, like never met a carve.

1789
01:44:58,010 --> 01:45:01,340
She didn't like right. And it was
like, it was bad for a minute.

1790
01:45:02,540 --> 01:45:06,830
She was like 12, 13,
whatever. And then, uh, she,

1791
01:45:06,860 --> 01:45:10,070
and she knows the difference and she
was also using food to sack, you know,

1792
01:45:10,071 --> 01:45:13,880
kind of assuage some
feelings and other stuff too.

1793
01:45:13,970 --> 01:45:18,290
That's interesting thing. But then
she's come around, but it's not,

1794
01:45:18,410 --> 01:45:22,260
let's not pretend that my kids listen.
They don't, their costs a little,

1795
01:45:22,310 --> 01:45:25,340
no they don't. No, they
don't. Your example,

1796
01:45:25,550 --> 01:45:29,530
that's more they're watching but they
don't listen. You think in a way Laird,

1797
01:45:29,550 --> 01:45:34,550
I could be sort of maybe imposing parents
in some way and I'm telling you they

1798
01:45:35,501 --> 01:45:39,740
are not. They don't, it doesn't,
they? They look at us like,

1799
01:45:40,700 --> 01:45:43,880
what do you got? It's like,
come on, it's your move.

1800
01:45:44,180 --> 01:45:46,520
So I've just learned
like it's your choice.

1801
01:45:46,820 --> 01:45:48,170
Like this is what I'm serving for dinner.

1802
01:45:48,171 --> 01:45:52,310
I don't have pop in the house obviously,
but if like we want someplace,

1803
01:45:53,060 --> 01:45:55,190
you know, I showed him a
picture when they were little.

1804
01:45:55,570 --> 01:45:59,600
I remember the guy who did like
eat this, not that Dave, uh,

1805
01:45:59,630 --> 01:46:03,290
with the Z for men's
health, the editor. Anyway,

1806
01:46:04,010 --> 01:46:07,670
it was like seven or eight chocolate chip
cookies and a sun kissed soda opposite

1807
01:46:07,671 --> 01:46:11,060
each other. And I'm like, do you want
to cookies or do you want that soda?

1808
01:46:11,600 --> 01:46:16,010
And they got it. It's like, oh okay. Cause
it showed how much sugar was in both.

1809
01:46:16,370 --> 01:46:17,930
So it's just that kind of stuff.
But they don't,

1810
01:46:17,960 --> 01:46:22,850
it's not like we live so healthy
and they listen. You know,

1811
01:46:23,030 --> 01:46:27,290
I mean, Ben Greenfield, right? He
lives in like the forest and they,

1812
01:46:27,820 --> 01:46:30,020
that's different.
It's a different level of control.

1813
01:46:30,050 --> 01:46:32,060
I don't have that kind of control.
Yeah.

1814
01:46:32,061 --> 01:46:35,570
Ben's got a weird thing going
on out there. His kids listen,

1815
01:46:36,720 --> 01:46:40,310
they must, they're out in the forest.
You have to, that's what I mean.

1816
01:46:40,370 --> 01:46:44,750
I'm saying I don't have that
level of containment that, uh,

1817
01:46:45,300 --> 01:46:48,740
that he has to do with predators,
like living predators.

1818
01:46:48,940 --> 01:46:51,900
You really let your kids just go
loose and your backyard. No, I know.

1819
01:46:51,930 --> 01:46:52,763
Keep an eye on them.

1820
01:46:52,770 --> 01:46:55,800
It's easier than Coca Cola and
cheeto zone a different kind of way.

1821
01:46:56,610 --> 01:47:00,300
I'm just saying like predators, very
straight forward. Like it's a predator.

1822
01:47:00,301 --> 01:47:04,470
Don't go out there. It's like, well, you
know, this food, it's in a bag. It's got,

1823
01:47:04,471 --> 01:47:08,100
you know, it's not that good for
you. Your cell functions like, okay,

1824
01:47:08,101 --> 01:47:11,730
what am my friends do it?
It's like, you know, Predator.

1825
01:47:12,180 --> 01:47:14,730
So I just think, I don't
know. I just think, uh,

1826
01:47:16,210 --> 01:47:19,840
I think I've surrendered to the idea of
them listening and I've just tried to

1827
01:47:19,841 --> 01:47:24,841
show them the best example and they are
intelligent people that I have faith and

1828
01:47:25,151 --> 01:47:29,200
will arrive at their own conclusion.
And by the way,

1829
01:47:31,050 --> 01:47:33,550
you know, they make, make other
choices. I don't think so though.

1830
01:47:33,730 --> 01:47:38,290
How many kids leave Kohai
like when they grow up?

1831
01:47:38,350 --> 01:47:40,290
Not many, I don't think. I think it's,

1832
01:47:40,300 --> 01:47:44,680
it's tough because it is so beautiful
and magical and on some level intuitively

1833
01:47:44,681 --> 01:47:49,450
it makes so much sense there. You know
what I mean? Like it makes a lot of sense,

1834
01:47:49,650 --> 01:47:53,550
right? Like the foods growing,
there's certain things that you,

1835
01:47:53,810 --> 01:47:55,720
and you go into the real
world and you're like, Whoa,

1836
01:47:55,750 --> 01:47:59,170
do they have good supermarkets
there? Yeah. Just everything.

1837
01:47:59,171 --> 01:48:03,410
Costs of a box of cereal is
like $9. Whoa. No, for real.

1838
01:48:04,660 --> 01:48:06,160
So it's hard,
but some kids leave.

1839
01:48:07,240 --> 01:48:11,100
I would think that that would
be a difficult transition
between going from quiet,

1840
01:48:11,140 --> 01:48:14,110
like moving to Chicago or
something like that. It can be,

1841
01:48:14,111 --> 01:48:17,860
especially if it's like December,
but I think you'd be surprised. Yeah.

1842
01:48:17,920 --> 01:48:20,800
Let me tell you, the cold is shocking
when you come from an island.

1843
01:48:21,430 --> 01:48:22,630
Like Larry goes snowboarding,

1844
01:48:22,631 --> 01:48:26,280
I'm like Alaska and stuff like that
cause he loves all that. Right.

1845
01:48:26,890 --> 01:48:29,710
But I grew up in Saint Thomas
and I'm just like, you know,

1846
01:48:29,711 --> 01:48:32,590
five days in the cold I'm like, this is
so beautiful. And then I'm like, I'm good.

1847
01:48:33,010 --> 01:48:35,740
You know. But I think you
know, listen island people,

1848
01:48:35,770 --> 01:48:40,770
they either like Jones for the big city
or the number one tourist destination

1849
01:48:40,811 --> 01:48:45,220
for Hawaiians. Do you know
what it is? What Vegas?

1850
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:51,070
Cause it's not really well cause it's
opposite, right? It's like, it's like uh,

1851
01:48:51,220 --> 01:48:55,750
everything's artificial age and then you
have a lot of like Filipino, Japanese,

1852
01:48:55,751 --> 01:49:00,460
Chinese, Hawaiians, so like
fine gambling, things like that.

1853
01:49:00,670 --> 01:49:02,650
Oh yeah.
It's a number one like Hawaiian Airlines.

1854
01:49:02,651 --> 01:49:06,130
That's their number one destination
for locals. They go to Vegas. Wow.

1855
01:49:06,630 --> 01:49:08,560
I mean cause it's the
antithesis, right? Yeah.

1856
01:49:08,561 --> 01:49:13,340
I guess you see the Strip and
all the neon, the craziness.
Totally giant flashing.

1857
01:49:13,341 --> 01:49:16,150
Yes. And that a drop of water
or not anything natural.

1858
01:49:16,151 --> 01:49:18,370
Like you're not really
supposed to be there. You know,

1859
01:49:18,371 --> 01:49:21,970
like there's no garden of Eden.
That makes sense. Oh totally.

1860
01:49:22,240 --> 01:49:25,510
So either either they
adapt, they go like, Hey,

1861
01:49:25,511 --> 01:49:29,380
I want to be a designer and live
in New York. Or um, you know,

1862
01:49:29,440 --> 01:49:32,680
that's gotta be the ultimate one 80
culture shock. They have that though.

1863
01:49:32,681 --> 01:49:36,460
For sure. Yeah, for sure.
They have that. I think I,

1864
01:49:36,461 --> 01:49:40,030
I'm with Laird though about living there.
Whenever I go there I'm like,

1865
01:49:40,031 --> 01:49:44,020
what in the fuck is this? I love
it. I love New York for like a week.

1866
01:49:44,800 --> 01:49:48,190
Well you can get stuff done in
New York and to a real New Yorker.

1867
01:49:48,190 --> 01:49:52,810
There's no other place like
New York. Right? Like I can
get whatever food I want.

1868
01:49:52,811 --> 01:49:55,960
Exactly how I want it.
There's that and I can get stuff done.

1869
01:49:55,961 --> 01:49:59,110
And you're also breathing in
dust all day. Yeah, it's tough.

1870
01:49:59,170 --> 01:50:02,770
And I don't think we're supposed to be
living on stacked on top of each other.

1871
01:50:02,800 --> 01:50:05,680
That's the thing. And there's always
like, yeah, something goes wrong.

1872
01:50:05,710 --> 01:50:09,730
This is the worst place you ever want
to be. Like garbage, water, toilets.

1873
01:50:09,731 --> 01:50:14,140
He's like, cause he's always thinking
about like if they turn the power off,

1874
01:50:14,320 --> 01:50:18,700
what's going to happen? Yeah. So
that's how he kind of how he lives.

1875
01:50:18,701 --> 01:50:19,780
I mean we had a uh,

1876
01:50:19,880 --> 01:50:24,610
a hundred year rain and [inaudible]
April five feet in a day.

1877
01:50:25,580 --> 01:50:28,720
Yeah. It was pretty radical. So, and
then, then we went through the fires.

1878
01:50:28,780 --> 01:50:31,560
So it's just like I think
fires and it rains that month.

1879
01:50:31,590 --> 01:50:35,710
Well know in map then we were here in
Malibu and so we had that like within six

1880
01:50:35,711 --> 01:50:38,800
months after. So I think he's always,
and I think, you know, listen,

1881
01:50:38,801 --> 01:50:40,000
when people do things in nature,

1882
01:50:40,001 --> 01:50:43,060
like rock climbers are big
wave surfers or whatever,

1883
01:50:43,061 --> 01:50:46,840
they're more in tune with the fact
that like stuff does go wrong.

1884
01:50:46,900 --> 01:50:50,080
And so they're not assuming that it's
always going to be as it always is.

1885
01:50:50,081 --> 01:50:52,780
So big storms out there where,

1886
01:50:53,240 --> 01:50:55,270
and quiet like hurricanes,

1887
01:50:55,990 --> 01:50:58,660
they haven't had really a
significant one since in Niki,

1888
01:50:58,661 --> 01:51:01,210
which I believe was in [inaudible]
92 which was really bad.

1889
01:51:01,211 --> 01:51:02,230
I think it was the lar,

1890
01:51:02,260 --> 01:51:06,490
the fastest wind speed
to hit land ever far.

1891
01:51:06,491 --> 01:51:10,000
Where you guys as the crow
flies from like the big island.

1892
01:51:11,020 --> 01:51:13,450
He's got [inaudible],
he's got a thing for the big island.

1893
01:51:13,510 --> 01:51:15,550
What's happened to you on the Big Island?
I love it there.

1894
01:51:16,030 --> 01:51:17,490
Did you have like an experience or no.

1895
01:51:17,580 --> 01:51:21,940
Do you go on a spiritual
journey or anything? I like
it there because it's, uh,

1896
01:51:22,540 --> 01:51:27,070
it's, it's, it's like a good
medium. Like, Yup. I get it.

1897
01:51:27,100 --> 01:51:30,790
Not quite as populated as Maui.

1898
01:51:31,300 --> 01:51:35,530
It's not as metropolitan. No,
but it's still pretty big.

1899
01:51:35,531 --> 01:51:40,240
Whereas Lanai is probably my favorite.
Really interesting. It's so quiet

1900
01:51:42,010 --> 01:51:45,430
and yeah, I hunt for like a day.
Oh, there we go. And it makes sense.

1901
01:51:45,460 --> 01:51:48,790
It's also a overpopulated,
so it's like the most,

1902
01:51:49,150 --> 01:51:51,790
it's like the best ethical
argument for hunting. Yeah.

1903
01:51:51,820 --> 01:51:53,950
Currently available in the
United States of America,

1904
01:51:54,040 --> 01:51:56,170
if you want to call Hawaii
the United States of America.

1905
01:51:56,380 --> 01:51:59,530
I know if you ask a Hawaiian like,
oh, you're American. They're like,

1906
01:51:59,560 --> 01:52:04,060
you know Hawaiian? Yeah, they're
Hawaiian. I'm quiet is the most north.

1907
01:52:04,090 --> 01:52:07,450
So it's the other end of the chain.
So how far away would it be?

1908
01:52:07,451 --> 01:52:10,120
So if you were going to fly
in an airplane, it's an hour,

1909
01:52:10,390 --> 01:52:14,680
45 or 45 minutes because of takeoff
and landing. If it was like straight,

1910
01:52:14,681 --> 01:52:19,000
like we whip, we go on a plane,
it's probably 28 minutes.

1911
01:52:19,090 --> 01:52:21,940
So how many miles is that?
Cause you're going 500 miles an hour.

1912
01:52:21,941 --> 01:52:25,930
It's a couple hundred miles.
Yeah, it is. Wow. Yeah, no, yeah,

1913
01:52:26,890 --> 01:52:31,280
yeah. No, I mean it's an amazing new
island forming right now, but yeah,

1914
01:52:32,590 --> 01:52:36,510
I like your fascination with Hawaii or
love it out there. I really do. Yeah,

1915
01:52:36,511 --> 01:52:39,280
it's great. Steven [inaudible] tried
to talk me into moving them out.

1916
01:52:39,750 --> 01:52:43,900
[inaudible] he loves it out there.
Really loves it.

1917
01:52:44,560 --> 01:52:46,040
Loves.
Yeah,

1918
01:52:46,100 --> 01:52:46,933
he gets out.

1919
01:52:47,140 --> 01:52:48,510
Yeah.
I mean he flies around,

1920
01:52:48,511 --> 01:52:51,960
does this Aerosmith shows and does
that television show and all that jazz,

1921
01:52:51,961 --> 01:52:52,920
but he loves Maui.

1922
01:52:53,160 --> 01:52:56,130
Yeah. You don't love it
too much. I do love Maui.

1923
01:52:56,131 --> 01:52:59,760
I guess I lived there also when it
was like a little less populated,

1924
01:52:59,850 --> 01:53:03,300
so it's like anything when you watch it,
you just to kind of go, whoa. But it's a,

1925
01:53:03,320 --> 01:53:07,470
it's a great blend for me.
It has still nothing compared to this.

1926
01:53:07,471 --> 01:53:10,800
Like I was just a, I mean it's
like this is, that's all right.

1927
01:53:10,830 --> 01:53:14,650
Well we're here is crazy. Ellis, what
do we have? Like 35 million people here?

1928
01:53:14,670 --> 01:53:16,800
Something preposterous.
It didn't even know really.

1929
01:53:16,801 --> 01:53:20,700
They're just guessed what he like the
ninth largest economy in the world. Yeah.

1930
01:53:20,701 --> 01:53:24,000
I told her when we had this whole
thing with all the, the Mexican,

1931
01:53:24,001 --> 01:53:26,190
you know the Mexican,
you know,

1932
01:53:26,220 --> 01:53:30,270
whatever non illegal whatever.
I said,

1933
01:53:30,330 --> 01:53:34,200
I have a friend of mine who, he's from
here but he's from Mexico and I said,

1934
01:53:35,130 --> 01:53:36,480
you should band together.

1935
01:53:36,600 --> 01:53:41,600
You have the ninth largest economy in
the world and get together and have

1936
01:53:42,481 --> 01:53:46,980
demands because you're helping run the
ninth largest economy in the world. Well,

1937
01:53:46,981 --> 01:53:50,250
that's what's hilarious about people
that want the immigrants to go back to

1938
01:53:50,251 --> 01:53:52,770
Mexico, listens to bid.
This thing would fall apart.

1939
01:53:53,010 --> 01:53:55,980
He told them when you talked to go
mobilize, let's go, and he was like,

1940
01:53:55,990 --> 01:53:58,770
what's crazy about it? It's like
they're already a part of the system.

1941
01:53:59,040 --> 01:54:01,470
Like why don't they get the benefits?
I said,

1942
01:54:01,471 --> 01:54:03,930
I think that he was laughing because when
I went to see him, I go, how's it going?

1943
01:54:03,931 --> 01:54:06,240
He goes, well, hopefully I'm here
tomorrow, joking, you know, and I go,

1944
01:54:06,840 --> 01:54:09,060
you guys have like
you're making it happen.

1945
01:54:10,500 --> 01:54:13,770
Get people to organize like that. They're
so worried about being shipped out now.

1946
01:54:13,771 --> 01:54:14,430
Ice,
you know,

1947
01:54:14,430 --> 01:54:17,790
I had a friend of mine who was a
veteran and he's an older gentleman,

1948
01:54:17,791 --> 01:54:22,170
he's in his fifties he got
up, pulled over at ice. Oh,

1949
01:54:22,171 --> 01:54:26,640
come on at the home depot.
They asked him where he's born and he say,

1950
01:54:26,641 --> 01:54:28,830
hey asshole, you're not supposed
to ask questions like that,

1951
01:54:29,070 --> 01:54:30,180
like you don't have a warrant to do.

1952
01:54:30,181 --> 01:54:33,570
And he started grilling the guys and he
pulled out his military id. He's like,

1953
01:54:33,571 --> 01:54:37,130
what the fuck are you guys
doing here? What do you think
you're doing? Yeah, yeah,

1954
01:54:37,260 --> 01:54:40,710
I'm American. I was born in America.
He goes, I'm an American citizen.

1955
01:54:40,711 --> 01:54:43,890
I'm also a veteran. And then he started,
he goes like, you guys, this is illegal.

1956
01:54:44,040 --> 01:54:45,130
And that's supposed to talk to people

1957
01:54:45,260 --> 01:54:49,480
this. But they could do that to people
that don't know and are scared. Right?

1958
01:54:49,890 --> 01:54:50,570
I mean,

1959
01:54:50,570 --> 01:54:54,170
yeah, but you, if you're just an
American citizen at fucking Home Depot,

1960
01:54:54,410 --> 01:54:58,160
you're not supposed to get harassed by
some guy who thinks you might be Mexican

1961
01:54:58,161 --> 01:55:01,550
because you're brown and brown
skin. Yeah, it's fucking crazy.

1962
01:55:01,720 --> 01:55:04,580
But it's just also like,
is this really where our problems are?

1963
01:55:04,581 --> 01:55:08,480
What about these using these resources
in a positive way because a lot of shit

1964
01:55:08,481 --> 01:55:09,440
that needs to get done,

1965
01:55:10,710 --> 01:55:12,240
but that's ever, I
mean, that's everywhere.

1966
01:55:12,241 --> 01:55:17,241
Thinking about how much time gets spent
on not doing anything and going the

1967
01:55:17,911 --> 01:55:19,380
other direction.
I don't know.

1968
01:55:19,540 --> 01:55:23,140
Well the, isn't that less of a problem
though when you have a small community,

1969
01:55:23,141 --> 01:55:27,580
like why that's gotta be looking at
a huge alleviation of frustration.

1970
01:55:27,880 --> 01:55:31,810
This is just the giant masses of
people and the stupid jobs everywhere.

1971
01:55:31,811 --> 01:55:36,580
It's like you got guys kind of kind of
boiled down to a much more natural state

1972
01:55:36,750 --> 01:55:40,200
one, it's all very accountable,
right? Like if I say something too,

1973
01:55:41,070 --> 01:55:44,230
I don't get to walk away from that.
Right. On a fucking little island,

1974
01:55:44,250 --> 01:55:48,510
I'm going to see a 50 more times that day.
And so I got to own it if I, you know,

1975
01:55:48,511 --> 01:55:49,080
and that,

1976
01:55:49,080 --> 01:55:53,490
that was all Laird's biggest adjustment
is because everything he does and says

1977
01:55:53,970 --> 01:55:57,030
he is owns it.
And so he,

1978
01:55:57,060 --> 01:56:00,630
when he first came here and like if even
driving, if someone flicked him off,

1979
01:56:01,200 --> 01:56:04,110
like you just don't do that in
Hawaii, could you, I know your truck.

1980
01:56:04,111 --> 01:56:07,200
Like I know you, I know your sister.
Like I'm coming to your house, you know,

1981
01:56:07,201 --> 01:56:08,810
like what are you talking about?
Right.

1982
01:56:09,510 --> 01:56:14,490
And I've been with him where he has pulled
people over and said, listen, like you,

1983
01:56:14,630 --> 01:56:19,080
you can't go and just like
drop off aggressive gestures.

1984
01:56:19,400 --> 01:56:21,870
Uh, you just don't know who,
like, what's up with people.

1985
01:56:21,870 --> 01:56:25,110
Like you've got to be accountable like
this, like, you know, and I'm like, okay,

1986
01:56:25,111 --> 01:56:30,020
well you cannot stop every vehicle and
jump out and be like, hey, you know, but

1987
01:56:31,680 --> 01:56:32,640
no, he's done it here. No,

1988
01:56:32,641 --> 01:56:36,570
you don't have to do it there cause
there and here it's dangerous. Yeah,

1989
01:56:36,600 --> 01:56:41,210
I guess 10 B it can be, it's
true. It can be, and he's,

1990
01:56:41,250 --> 01:56:44,070
but again, he's, he's older and wiser.

1991
01:56:44,730 --> 01:56:47,700
I'm talking about like maybe when we
first were together in his early thirties

1992
01:56:47,790 --> 01:56:52,740
crazy Laird, but he still has a look at
his eye where it's like, I don't know.

1993
01:56:52,790 --> 01:56:54,990
Yeah, I get it. Like, well,

1994
01:56:54,991 --> 01:56:57,540
if you're really used to that environment
to where everybody is accountable and

1995
01:56:57,541 --> 01:57:00,790
then you see these just
assholes. Yeah. Well that's it.

1996
01:57:00,840 --> 01:57:04,020
And also if you really said, okay,
let's go outside, they'd be like,

1997
01:57:04,021 --> 01:57:07,650
I'm going to get a lawyer. I think
for him, that's the weird twisty part.

1998
01:57:07,950 --> 01:57:11,820
It's like in Hawaii, if they say it, it's
like, okay, let's go. At least it's like,

1999
01:57:11,821 --> 01:57:14,940
okay, I'm going to stand
up to own the words I say,

2000
01:57:14,941 --> 01:57:19,320
and everything here it's like if you
go okay, and they go, no, you know,

2001
01:57:20,130 --> 01:57:24,510
I'm going to call somebody.
It's like, he's like, okay,
well, which is it? You know?

2002
01:57:24,511 --> 01:57:27,390
Like I always tell my kid that was my
one daughter does that. She'll be like,

2003
01:57:27,391 --> 01:57:30,030
really aggressive and then you, if
you call her on it, she gets like,

2004
01:57:30,090 --> 01:57:33,570
she's the victim. I go, no, no, you
have to pick like which one are you?

2005
01:57:33,571 --> 01:57:36,450
Are you like aggressive or are you
the victim? But I don't know. I,

2006
01:57:36,840 --> 01:57:40,050
I think it's interesting, he, he will
call people out every time though.

2007
01:57:40,051 --> 01:57:43,770
If they are acting weird, he'll just say
like, what's up? Or How's your day? 10?

2008
01:57:43,771 --> 01:57:45,780
And I'm like,
oh people are not accustomed to,

2009
01:57:46,410 --> 01:57:50,070
because in Hawaii they were just very
respectful that way. And welding,

2010
01:57:50,130 --> 01:57:51,540
there's accountability.
And I think

2011
01:57:53,190 --> 01:57:57,690
there's also a lot of fighters come out
of Hawaii. Well cause it's a fighting,

2012
01:57:57,691 --> 01:57:58,980
it's a warrior culture.

2013
01:57:59,040 --> 01:58:04,040
So you know like uncle
slapped boys' heads and like,

2014
01:58:04,410 --> 01:58:09,030
and it's also now because of the Brazilian
influence coming in, now you've got,

2015
01:58:09,120 --> 01:58:12,540
you know, Jujitsu and, and
also I think about this,

2016
01:58:12,910 --> 01:58:17,370
they're pretty strong,
right? And, and so contact,

2017
01:58:17,640 --> 01:58:19,260
they don't mind little contact,

2018
01:58:19,470 --> 01:58:23,490
like they even joke about like Polynesian
rugby players. Like it's like, oh fun.

2019
01:58:23,550 --> 01:58:25,980
Like Oh, you know, like
we're leveling each other.

2020
01:58:26,430 --> 01:58:28,980
So you're also talking about people who
maybe they don't mind a little little

2021
01:58:28,981 --> 01:58:32,790
contact, you know, like playful
because they are also playful.

2022
01:58:33,360 --> 01:58:35,400
So it's also like this weird
thing of like, I'm not,

2023
01:58:35,401 --> 01:58:40,080
I don't take myself so serious. So there's
like a playfulness but also like, oh,

2024
01:58:40,590 --> 01:58:45,340
we're gonna do you notice a big difference
between like female athletes and male

2025
01:58:45,341 --> 01:58:47,590
athletes? Like, okay.
Cause fighting is a pretty,

2026
01:58:49,250 --> 01:58:52,760
I don't want to say exaggerated,
but it's an interesting thing where,

2027
01:58:53,950 --> 01:58:58,310
you know, you have men and women kind of
differently, but doing the same thing,

2028
01:58:58,580 --> 01:59:02,570
if you will. Yeah. Um, do you notice
a difference in their mentality?

2029
01:59:03,770 --> 01:59:04,603
Um,

2030
01:59:05,310 --> 01:59:08,520
well they vary so much individually.
That's what's interesting.

2031
01:59:08,550 --> 01:59:13,200
It's like you'll find even male fighters
are like super laid back and then you

2032
01:59:13,201 --> 01:59:16,920
find other ones that are really
intense and super emotional and uh,

2033
01:59:16,921 --> 01:59:19,290
it's really hard to tell.
Like there's a,

2034
01:59:19,320 --> 01:59:23,130
there's Gunnar Nelson is a
guy from Iceland, you know,
is, I know who he is. Yeah.

2035
01:59:23,310 --> 01:59:26,790
Fantastic. Jujitsu guy. You cannot
get that guy to change as expression.

2036
01:59:26,820 --> 01:59:31,140
It doesn't change. You could punch him,
kick him in the balls. He stay stoic.

2037
01:59:31,141 --> 01:59:34,950
It's a weird, he's a weird guy.
Yeah. He's very on one side of it.

2038
01:59:34,951 --> 01:59:35,771
And then there's like,

2039
01:59:35,771 --> 01:59:39,300
I like Conor Mcgregor who's also his
training partner who's on a completely

2040
01:59:39,301 --> 01:59:40,051
different side of it.

2041
01:59:40,051 --> 01:59:43,200
He's screaming and yelling and talking
shit to everybody and you know, that's,

2042
01:59:43,201 --> 01:59:47,160
that's part of his flair. Right. You
know, they vary so widely and it's,

2043
01:59:47,161 --> 01:59:48,390
that's true with girls too.

2044
01:59:48,600 --> 01:59:52,170
Some girls are brash and outrageous and
they get another girl's faces and put

2045
01:59:52,171 --> 01:59:55,890
their knuckles on their nose and when
they're at the stare down and other girls

2046
01:59:55,891 --> 01:59:58,500
bow on the hug and they
take selfies together,

2047
01:59:58,501 --> 02:00:01,110
it's like everyone has their own
sort of approach to it. Yeah.

2048
02:00:01,210 --> 02:00:02,070
It's very interesting.

2049
02:00:02,130 --> 02:00:03,870
It is interesting. I'm always, I'm,

2050
02:00:04,050 --> 02:00:07,650
I'm in fighting and intrigues me and
that I think it's interesting that you're

2051
02:00:07,651 --> 02:00:12,060
trying to be offensive and defensive
at the same time dealing with fear,

2052
02:00:12,090 --> 02:00:16,650
like all these things happening
simultaneously. And I then take it,

2053
02:00:17,040 --> 02:00:20,700
I look at it one step further
with a female because,

2054
02:00:22,530 --> 02:00:23,020
okay.

2055
02:00:23,020 --> 02:00:25,960
I don't know. I, I, I'm
interested to know how if,

2056
02:00:25,990 --> 02:00:30,990
if a female can fight from a
non non anonymous [inaudible]
place but without her

2057
02:00:33,311 --> 02:00:36,580
emotion,
like just like okay I'm in my mail,

2058
02:00:36,581 --> 02:00:40,450
I'm in my athlete and um,
I'm not going to be like,

2059
02:00:40,480 --> 02:00:44,200
oh she didn't just kick me in the
ear, you know, and like freak out.

2060
02:00:44,230 --> 02:00:48,730
You know what I mean? Like cause I think
about myself and I'd be like, you know,

2061
02:00:48,731 --> 02:00:51,520
like I've only been in one
fight my whole life and,

2062
02:00:51,580 --> 02:00:54,370
and the girl hit me in the face and
when I saw my blood I was like, oh no,

2063
02:00:54,371 --> 02:00:57,520
she did not just hit me in the
face, you know, and then went crazy.

2064
02:00:58,300 --> 02:01:02,140
But if these girls could be like, cause
they're so well trained as an athlete,

2065
02:01:02,680 --> 02:01:07,680
how that can supersede or
override actually like this
in the feminine impulse of

2066
02:01:09,941 --> 02:01:14,420
like a, you know, reaction, a reaction.

2067
02:01:14,770 --> 02:01:17,320
Masculine impulse to though
I think it's a human impulse.

2068
02:01:17,321 --> 02:01:19,570
If a guy punches you in the face,
you get furious.

2069
02:01:19,930 --> 02:01:23,530
It's so hard for people to
not get emotional when they
get hit because you want

2070
02:01:23,531 --> 02:01:25,060
to get it back.
That's a good point.

2071
02:01:25,061 --> 02:01:29,440
It's a very bad way to react in a fight
to fight with emotions because you

2072
02:01:29,441 --> 02:01:33,700
expose yourself, right? You leave
yourself open for counters, you just, you,

2073
02:01:33,800 --> 02:01:38,170
you miss your rhythm. You not as
deceptive and your, your emotions,

2074
02:01:38,440 --> 02:01:40,130
you're too and your pattern

2075
02:01:40,160 --> 02:01:43,610
and so many times you,
you get hit a lot more and it's a,

2076
02:01:43,611 --> 02:01:47,180
it's a big problem with fighters. That
emotion, that's a very big problem.

2077
02:01:47,450 --> 02:01:49,580
And the wanting to break people,

2078
02:01:49,581 --> 02:01:51,860
like letting them hit you so that
you could show them that they,

2079
02:01:51,940 --> 02:01:56,540
they can hurt you. I think
it's a masculine thing to
stupid. It's a very stupid,

2080
02:01:56,570 --> 02:01:59,960
take it on the face on purpose and then
just like, come on, come on, come on,

2081
02:01:59,970 --> 02:02:01,710
hit me.
Yeah.

2082
02:02:01,830 --> 02:02:05,210
Then that's a terrible emotion though
cause you can get completely knocked

2083
02:02:05,211 --> 02:02:07,550
unconscious doing that
happens all the time.

2084
02:02:07,790 --> 02:02:12,790
It's just the smart thing to do is to
fight with correct technique and with a

2085
02:02:14,421 --> 02:02:15,410
correct strategy,

2086
02:02:15,740 --> 02:02:19,430
meaning you have an understanding
of how to execute best.

2087
02:02:19,600 --> 02:02:23,180
It's not to just wait in and let
bombs fly. It's, you have to,

2088
02:02:23,181 --> 02:02:27,710
you have to be very precise in your
tactics. You've got to be very smart.

2089
02:02:28,140 --> 02:02:32,670
I think it's interesting though, um,
those sports where there is that,

2090
02:02:33,060 --> 02:02:37,380
I mean, listen, versions of
it is football. You know,
living with layered, obviously,

2091
02:02:37,381 --> 02:02:37,561
you know,

2092
02:02:37,561 --> 02:02:41,400
he always says he appreciates mother
nature because it's like you make good

2093
02:02:41,401 --> 02:02:45,780
decisions. You're rewarded, you make
bad decisions, you, you pay a price.

2094
02:02:46,710 --> 02:02:51,710
But I think it is very interesting when
you have two humans strategically trying

2095
02:02:52,681 --> 02:02:56,550
to deconstruct one another. Um, the chest,

2096
02:02:56,560 --> 02:03:00,510
the physical chest that goes on as like
looking at it from another athlete's

2097
02:03:00,511 --> 02:03:02,550
point of view.
Um,

2098
02:03:02,880 --> 02:03:07,370
I think it's a unique person that wants
to put themselves in that situation.

2099
02:03:07,500 --> 02:03:11,910
You know, it's like, I understand
almost like, uh, you know,

2100
02:03:11,970 --> 02:03:16,290
a surfer and a wave and a rock
climber and a mountain. I get that.

2101
02:03:16,860 --> 02:03:19,310
Like I'm going to be a part of that.
Um,

2102
02:03:19,820 --> 02:03:22,500
but I find it really
interesting and even sort of,

2103
02:03:22,501 --> 02:03:26,280
I'm even more curious about
women, like who say like, yeah,

2104
02:03:26,281 --> 02:03:27,720
this is going to be my sport

2105
02:03:28,440 --> 02:03:33,240
wildly. Uh, like there's Holly Holm.
She just seems like awfully sweet.

2106
02:03:33,690 --> 02:03:37,450
She seemed like she'd bring you cupcakes
or murder you kick your fucking ice

2107
02:03:37,710 --> 02:03:40,350
pack. I mean, listen, I saw
that kick, but then it's like,

2108
02:03:40,770 --> 02:03:44,910
I'm so sorry I made you these after, you
know, chocolate chip cookies. It's like,

2109
02:03:45,360 --> 02:03:49,810
okay, I'll get it. You know,
when I come back from the
hospital, I don't know. It's,

2110
02:03:49,811 --> 02:03:52,920
it is interesting when you see girls
like that. Well, they're all different.

2111
02:03:53,460 --> 02:03:55,080
I always want to know,
did they have brothers,

2112
02:03:55,820 --> 02:03:59,190
like where they rabble rousing and
that their whole time and it wasn't,

2113
02:03:59,280 --> 02:04:02,220
and they learned to play in,
it wasn't personal, you know,

2114
02:04:02,221 --> 02:04:06,400
and like a little contact
was okay. Maybe. I mean,

2115
02:04:06,401 --> 02:04:09,280
I'm Ronda Rousey his case. It
was also, it was very much right.

2116
02:04:09,780 --> 02:04:12,690
Her mom was a world judo champion.
Her mom was a pieced.

2117
02:04:12,840 --> 02:04:14,280
She's had an interesting path,
I think.

2118
02:04:14,360 --> 02:04:19,050
Right? Yeah. Yeah. I'm wonder how
much she loves the WWE. I wonder,

2119
02:04:19,080 --> 02:04:23,850
I always wonder when a person is like an
elite athlete at the highest level one,

2120
02:04:23,970 --> 02:04:25,110
a real one.
If they,

2121
02:04:25,650 --> 02:04:28,470
they still enjoy doing that because
I think she enjoyed it though.

2122
02:04:28,471 --> 02:04:29,520
I think she was a fan of it.
Yeah,

2123
02:04:29,670 --> 02:04:34,450
for sure. Yeah. I think she actually
enjoyed pro wrestling, you know,

2124
02:04:34,451 --> 02:04:39,451
and she doing athletic things even though
it's obviously flying off of an into

2125
02:04:40,230 --> 02:04:44,160
and around. I mean it's
athletic, but it's scripted. Yes,

2126
02:04:44,190 --> 02:04:46,770
it's not competition.
But then again,

2127
02:04:47,520 --> 02:04:50,230
you could only get knocked
unconscious so many times.

2128
02:04:50,260 --> 02:04:53,370
You can only get fucked up so
many times and she got fucked up.

2129
02:04:53,371 --> 02:04:58,170
Two fights in a row really bad.
The Holly Holm Kao Ruthless.

2130
02:04:58,350 --> 02:04:59,011
That was brutal.

2131
02:04:59,011 --> 02:05:03,900
And then Amanda Nunez just punched her
face and for 48 seconds it was horrific.

2132
02:05:04,230 --> 02:05:06,600
That was hard to watch.
I like to watch, I mean,

2133
02:05:06,601 --> 02:05:10,740
I don't like to watch a really big
guys punch each other and women,

2134
02:05:11,070 --> 02:05:13,350
I don't know why.
Like when guys are a little smaller,

2135
02:05:13,740 --> 02:05:17,520
it's easier to watch as long as they're
not kicking themselves in the head.

2136
02:05:18,030 --> 02:05:22,380
I'm just saying. So the big scary ones
like heavyweights dropping bombs on, yeah,

2137
02:05:22,381 --> 02:05:26,590
you just go, oh my God, that just that
guy I took eight years off that guys,

2138
02:05:26,610 --> 02:05:31,280
you know, it was definitely
different. Notice it like a,

2139
02:05:31,290 --> 02:05:34,500
there's certain heavyweights and they hit
guys and they get knocked unconscious,

2140
02:05:34,501 --> 02:05:39,210
whether it's Frances and gone who or
steep Vimeo church or these big guys and

2141
02:05:39,211 --> 02:05:42,480
they slammed, someone's like, oh my God.
That's what I mean. Like I watch that.

2142
02:05:42,481 --> 02:05:47,400
I don't actually, I mean violence. I know
it's sport. For me it's, oh, it's violent.

2143
02:05:47,520 --> 02:05:48,510
It is.
Yeah.

2144
02:05:50,040 --> 02:05:55,040
It is a very dangerous path that you
have to know when to get off and more,

2145
02:05:56,340 --> 02:06:00,430
I dunno if I would say more so than other
combat sports, but yeah, it makes sense.

2146
02:06:00,450 --> 02:06:05,100
All of them, all of them have a path.
But I think very specifically MMA has,

2147
02:06:05,670 --> 02:06:10,080
you have to be really careful because
the consequences are so great.

2148
02:06:10,110 --> 02:06:12,570
There's not enough padding and
those gloves are tiny little things.

2149
02:06:12,571 --> 02:06:15,570
You could also get kicked.
He could get kneed in the face,

2150
02:06:15,571 --> 02:06:19,350
elbowed in the face and once you've
realized the Chin starts going and your

2151
02:06:19,351 --> 02:06:22,080
reflex is start going and you're,
you're slowing down.

2152
02:06:22,080 --> 02:06:25,230
Like you got to get out and out,
got to get out.

2153
02:06:25,650 --> 02:06:30,390
And sometimes they don't get the proper
advice and sometimes they don't know

2154
02:06:30,391 --> 02:06:33,850
what else to do. They don't have anywhere
else to go. And that goes back to, yeah,

2155
02:06:34,290 --> 02:06:34,750
I was talking,

2156
02:06:34,750 --> 02:06:38,280
I talked to Larry about that cause we
have tons of friends in organized sports

2157
02:06:38,281 --> 02:06:40,470
stuff.
Like you have to be drafted or coach,

2158
02:06:40,500 --> 02:06:42,840
the team has to pick you up or you know,
whatever.

2159
02:06:43,620 --> 02:06:47,280
And I say to him like how fortunate
are you that you're in a sport

2160
02:06:48,930 --> 02:06:53,640
like other athletes, like a snowboarder
or whatever that you can go,

2161
02:06:54,210 --> 02:06:58,440
you can go out. Yeah. You want
to ride, you can go right.
Nobody's dictating to you.

2162
02:06:59,070 --> 02:07:02,010
And if you're really smart and you're
managing yourself and your health and your

2163
02:07:02,011 --> 02:07:05,820
wellbeing and your melon and everything
else, you could write a really long time.

2164
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,610
Yeah. That's a big difference between
that and a competitive fighter.

2165
02:07:08,850 --> 02:07:13,500
55 years of age, you aren't doing shit
getting hit over and over. No chance.

2166
02:07:13,950 --> 02:07:17,420
I mean you could still train in
certain aspects, especially Jujitsu.

2167
02:07:17,480 --> 02:07:21,010
Lot of people deepen their
sixties seventies, 80s train. Uh,

2168
02:07:21,030 --> 02:07:24,600
you can definitely do that. But there's
a such a such a difference, you know,

2169
02:07:24,601 --> 02:07:28,740
layered can go out there and do what
he wants to do at the same level he was

2170
02:07:28,741 --> 02:07:31,090
able to do two decades ago.
It's,

2171
02:07:31,710 --> 02:07:35,230
it's exhausting actually to live with.
I swear to God

2172
02:07:36,360 --> 02:07:41,360
cause I feel like Laird is like I in
this way of like when you live with

2173
02:07:42,011 --> 02:07:45,370
somebody that's sort of, you know, it's
like, I mean you, you have a partner,

2174
02:07:45,371 --> 02:07:49,750
it's like in ways there a
reference to you in certain ways.

2175
02:07:50,080 --> 02:07:54,280
And so I, if I like living with him and
you're referencing him as an athlete,

2176
02:07:54,281 --> 02:07:59,080
you're just like, oh man, I gotta get,
I gotta get busy. I got to get training,

2177
02:07:59,081 --> 02:08:03,910
I got to get moving. You know, it's
just like, cause he's, he's nonstop,

2178
02:08:03,911 --> 02:08:07,220
that guy cause he has to, that's
a different type. You know, I,

2179
02:08:07,480 --> 02:08:09,460
a lot of times I'll train cause I'm like,
Hey,

2180
02:08:09,461 --> 02:08:13,060
I know how good I feel when I'm done and
it's important and I have other stuff I

2181
02:08:13,061 --> 02:08:16,540
need to do but I'm going to get it in.
And for a guy like that,

2182
02:08:16,541 --> 02:08:20,770
it's just like what it would be like if
I took an 80 pound dumbbell and saw at

2183
02:08:20,771 --> 02:08:23,680
the bottom of the pool for a minute
and then tried to do 15 you know,

2184
02:08:23,681 --> 02:08:25,810
it's just like he also
has a creative approach.

2185
02:08:26,410 --> 02:08:30,580
I'm more linear and it's like for
time and for this and he's like,

2186
02:08:30,790 --> 02:08:33,550
let's just go until we can't
anymore. It's like, okay,

2187
02:08:33,610 --> 02:08:36,670
when's that drill going to end?
You know what I mean?

2188
02:08:37,730 --> 02:08:40,960
Do you train with them? Only
in the pool. I'm telling you,

2189
02:08:40,961 --> 02:08:43,810
you got to come with a friend and
someone that you feel safe with.

2190
02:08:44,020 --> 02:08:45,070
And I'm going to be honest with you.

2191
02:08:45,071 --> 02:08:50,071
We have fighters and trainers
have the hardest time in the pool.

2192
02:08:50,530 --> 02:08:53,440
Really? Yes. And I'll tell you
why. A lot of them are built,

2193
02:08:53,441 --> 02:08:57,820
they have a lot of mass. Okay.
Like it. So number one right there.

2194
02:08:57,821 --> 02:09:02,050
Just the mass, like you're more
dense, you go to the bottom. Okay. Um,

2195
02:09:02,080 --> 02:09:07,080
the other side of it is they're used to
doing everything quickly and the water's

2196
02:09:07,990 --> 02:09:11,980
like, awesome that you want to do it
quick, this is how we're going to do it.

2197
02:09:12,460 --> 02:09:16,780
Right. And so it's a pretty cool
environment. Um, but we've had a lot of,

2198
02:09:16,810 --> 02:09:19,450
we've had fighters and
trainers and they're built for,

2199
02:09:19,451 --> 02:09:22,750
but once obviously once they get the
hang of it, but I think it's, um,

2200
02:09:23,800 --> 02:09:28,300
it's pretty special to the training
because you, when you're done, again,

2201
02:09:28,301 --> 02:09:30,910
it goes back to I am like a noodle,

2202
02:09:30,970 --> 02:09:34,810
you're exhausted and your
joints are not just hammered.

2203
02:09:34,840 --> 02:09:38,080
So this is called [inaudible].
It's like,

2204
02:09:38,350 --> 02:09:41,460
it's part of the whole thing
that you could follow. Yeah.

2205
02:09:41,590 --> 02:09:42,790
I mean the pool training though,

2206
02:09:42,791 --> 02:09:45,760
it's like you have to kind of do it with
somebody, someone else to show you. Yeah.

2207
02:09:45,790 --> 02:09:49,240
I mean we started, originally it was like
we were weight vests and Laird's like,

2208
02:09:49,241 --> 02:09:53,680
just go try it as long as you can. And
it's like, okay, I think I'm good now.

2209
02:09:53,710 --> 02:09:57,010
Like I, I cannot swim anymore,
you know, I can't tread anymore.

2210
02:09:57,011 --> 02:09:59,290
And then w it was actually
one of my daughters,

2211
02:09:59,291 --> 02:10:02,110
she might've been like
six or seven at the time,

2212
02:10:02,140 --> 02:10:05,590
maybe younger and she would swim to the
surface with a dumbbell and learns like,

2213
02:10:05,620 --> 02:10:05,861
Oh,

2214
02:10:05,861 --> 02:10:10,120
what if we made you had reps and you do
sequencing where you're on an exhale or

2215
02:10:10,121 --> 02:10:14,740
on an inhale or whatever. He'll
go from like, uh, you know,

2216
02:10:15,870 --> 02:10:20,770
I versa climber or a bike and have
your heart rate way up and then go,

2217
02:10:20,771 --> 02:10:21,900
okay,
now you're going to do the set.

2218
02:10:22,090 --> 02:10:26,350
So it's like there's all these ways to
adapt and it's pretty cool I think for

2219
02:10:26,351 --> 02:10:29,890
people who train. That's the whole thing
is how do you keep modifying and like,

2220
02:10:29,891 --> 02:10:33,650
do you get locked in like on your
training or do you keep going, okay,

2221
02:10:34,190 --> 02:10:36,650
I've heard you talk about like, Oh,
I've added Yoga and all these things.

2222
02:10:36,651 --> 02:10:39,020
Like that's the other thing is like
you get pretty good at something,

2223
02:10:39,021 --> 02:10:41,360
but now how do you keep kind of adding,

2224
02:10:41,810 --> 02:10:45,680
doing things that you're sort of unsure,
you're uncomfortable, you're not good at.

2225
02:10:45,681 --> 02:10:48,500
I think that that's always been
easier for layered than me.

2226
02:10:48,620 --> 02:10:51,560
I've always sort of going like, well no,
I'm good over here. Like I do this good.

2227
02:10:51,590 --> 02:10:55,730
It's like, okay, change it up, you
know? So I think that's been a,

2228
02:10:56,120 --> 02:10:58,910
I think that's a thing. So that's,
that has everything that has,

2229
02:10:58,911 --> 02:10:59,810
we do a lot of breathing,

2230
02:10:59,811 --> 02:11:04,330
heat and ice cause his other thing is
like active recovery. People go, oh I'm,

2231
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:07,040
I'm half a day off. It's like, okay,

2232
02:11:07,100 --> 02:11:10,520
so what are you going to do to actively
recover? Not just take the day off.

2233
02:11:10,970 --> 02:11:15,650
So I think he's, you know, been really
into that. But so active recovery,

2234
02:11:15,651 --> 02:11:20,651
meaning you do some breathing or something
mellow so that you can participate in

2235
02:11:21,230 --> 02:11:23,810
helping the body actually recover,
not just sit around.

2236
02:11:24,440 --> 02:11:25,760
How much of would benefit is that?

2237
02:11:25,761 --> 02:11:29,000
And like doing something physical as
opposed to just sitting around doing

2238
02:11:29,001 --> 02:11:30,350
nothing?
I think it's,

2239
02:11:30,410 --> 02:11:33,650
I think it makes a huge difference
because I don't think it's about,

2240
02:11:34,010 --> 02:11:38,540
I have to tax my, my adrenals are
my nervous system or any of that.

2241
02:11:38,541 --> 02:11:42,050
I think it's okay. I'm going to
take a very, uh, you know, uh,

2242
02:11:42,170 --> 02:11:44,940
a Yin Yoga class.
So the poses are along,

2243
02:11:44,960 --> 02:11:49,960
it won't be like necessarily a high
flow class or I'm going to do multiple

2244
02:11:50,301 --> 02:11:51,830
series of heat and ice.

2245
02:11:51,860 --> 02:11:54,950
Like some days he'll go and just do three
rounds in the sauna and three rounds

2246
02:11:54,951 --> 02:11:59,210
of the ice or I'm going to do
35 or 45 minutes of breathing,

2247
02:11:59,510 --> 02:12:01,340
you know, recovery, breathing,

2248
02:12:01,341 --> 02:12:04,280
things like that to really oxygenate
the tissue and the cells and things like

2249
02:12:04,281 --> 02:12:04,521
that.

2250
02:12:04,521 --> 02:12:09,050
So I think it's just kind of looking
at what a day off looks like and making

2251
02:12:09,051 --> 02:12:12,440
that something that you participate in,
in,

2252
02:12:12,760 --> 02:12:16,790
in supporting the recovery, not just
I laid around now having said that,

2253
02:12:16,970 --> 02:12:19,010
there are days where after you're
done with that, yeah, great.

2254
02:12:19,011 --> 02:12:23,210
Lay around like go to sleep early,
eat extra more calories,

2255
02:12:23,211 --> 02:12:26,540
whatever you need to do.
But I think active recovery,

2256
02:12:26,541 --> 02:12:31,010
even riding a bike, you know,
flushing the system, the tissue,

2257
02:12:31,011 --> 02:12:34,790
things like that. I think, uh,
people think, uh, you know,

2258
02:12:34,791 --> 02:12:36,290
off means like nothing.

2259
02:12:36,740 --> 02:12:40,130
And I think doing something or for a
certain athletes like maybe get a massage

2260
02:12:40,140 --> 02:12:42,530
that day, that might be
the best thing, you know.

2261
02:12:42,530 --> 02:12:45,530
So I think for him it's filling it out.

2262
02:12:45,740 --> 02:12:49,850
Do you guys use any electronics look in
terms of apps or heart rate monitors or

2263
02:12:49,851 --> 02:12:54,110
anything along those lines? Not too,
too much. I used to use a fitbit, um,

2264
02:12:54,560 --> 02:12:57,690
layered uses a ox oximeter,

2265
02:12:57,740 --> 02:13:02,270
x oximeter oximeter to like if he does
a breathing to see if he can get as him

2266
02:13:02,290 --> 02:13:06,380
self up to altitude. So he'll use
that to measure and things like that.

2267
02:13:06,381 --> 02:13:09,320
But I think once you do something,
I'm really,

2268
02:13:09,321 --> 02:13:11,480
really long time.

2269
02:13:11,960 --> 02:13:15,230
You sort of go on my n the edge or Rni.
Um,

2270
02:13:15,710 --> 02:13:18,620
he'll use electronics more
for speed and distance.

2271
02:13:18,680 --> 02:13:21,050
He'll put it on his boards and be like,
okay,

2272
02:13:21,051 --> 02:13:25,190
we went x miles and the
peak speed was whatever,

2273
02:13:25,310 --> 02:13:28,290
50 miles an hour.
So he'll use it more for that to,

2274
02:13:28,550 --> 02:13:32,380
to measure distance on how
many miles he wrote day, um,

2275
02:13:32,850 --> 02:13:36,720
on the water,
but not necessarily micromanaging,

2276
02:13:37,350 --> 02:13:40,440
uh, electronically. All the
metrics. Now, having said that,

2277
02:13:40,441 --> 02:13:43,380
if you were an athlete where you know,

2278
02:13:43,381 --> 02:13:48,020
little seconds here and there made a
difference, maybe you would write, um,

2279
02:13:48,090 --> 02:13:53,040
or you know, checking your heart rate and
things like that, but not, not too often.

2280
02:13:53,520 --> 02:13:57,060
No. Yeah, I would think that like
things like heart rate variability,

2281
02:13:57,061 --> 02:14:01,530
finding out if you're
recovering correctly. Yeah.
Not your, your heart rate.

2282
02:14:01,531 --> 02:14:05,310
It varies in the morning,
right. Day to day. But yeah,

2283
02:14:05,311 --> 02:14:06,900
that makes a big difference
between if you're,

2284
02:14:06,930 --> 02:14:08,700
if you're doing something
like Michael Phelps

2285
02:14:09,100 --> 02:14:09,950
that was,
trying to think so,

2286
02:14:09,951 --> 02:14:13,500
or track athletes where it's all these
milliseconds I think for layer it's like

2287
02:14:13,950 --> 02:14:18,360
I feel good today and I'm going to
go, well, there's a lot more natural.

2288
02:14:19,050 --> 02:14:23,250
It's more natural thing, isn't it?
Like those days like you go, wow, I am,

2289
02:14:23,340 --> 02:14:26,990
I'm tired today and I'll just
kind of do the best I can. Yeah.

2290
02:14:27,090 --> 02:14:30,540
But I think I understand wanting to
measure things and also sort of saying,

2291
02:14:30,541 --> 02:14:34,770
I feel tired because there's
an interesting thing of
feeling tired physically,

2292
02:14:34,771 --> 02:14:38,160
but you're actually emotionally tired
because if you look at your metrics on

2293
02:14:38,161 --> 02:14:40,320
your physical,
you have a lot more to give.

2294
02:14:40,620 --> 02:14:44,970
And so it's Kinda then checking in and
saying, well, what's going on for me?

2295
02:14:44,971 --> 02:14:49,770
I'm usually more tired personally
than I am physically, you know,

2296
02:14:49,771 --> 02:14:53,340
like especially with your 11 year
old giving you shit. [inaudible] man,

2297
02:14:53,550 --> 02:14:58,350
she's awesome. She's so, but
that's what I'm saying, like
I can be wiped out. Right,

2298
02:14:58,351 --> 02:14:58,740
right,
right.

2299
02:14:58,740 --> 02:15:01,560
I could train for an hour and I could
hang out with birdie 13 minutes in the car

2300
02:15:01,561 --> 02:15:05,280
and she's the victor, like, you know,
her foot's on my hip and she's standing,

2301
02:15:05,281 --> 02:15:09,090
you know, in the post. Um,
and that has been my lesson.

2302
02:15:09,120 --> 02:15:12,420
That's one of my many lessons.
Ongoing lessons is like,

2303
02:15:14,460 --> 02:15:19,380
you can't, you cannot go
at everything head on. And,

2304
02:15:19,381 --> 02:15:22,560
uh, I've learned that certainly
being in a marriage, uh, I,

2305
02:15:23,010 --> 02:15:25,590
I developed a little bit of finesse and,
uh,

2306
02:15:26,100 --> 02:15:29,850
and as a parent just kind of going like,
I'm here to love you.

2307
02:15:29,851 --> 02:15:34,500
I'm here to support you and I'm also
going to recognize that, um, you know,

2308
02:15:34,620 --> 02:15:37,610
you're probably not going to always
do it hardly ever actually the way I,

2309
02:15:37,830 --> 02:15:39,330
I think you should or I want you to.

2310
02:15:39,830 --> 02:15:42,100
So what made you guys start,
um,

2311
02:15:42,200 --> 02:15:45,890
putting together the coffee and the super
foods supplements and all that? Yeah,

2312
02:15:46,150 --> 02:15:50,510
by accident. Really. Um, what
happened is, is layered used to,

2313
02:15:50,540 --> 02:15:52,520
he's been in as far as
long as I've known him.

2314
02:15:52,521 --> 02:15:55,970
He's had coffee come from all around.
He's of coffee freak.

2315
02:15:56,360 --> 02:16:00,980
And then what happened is Paul
Chek, I don't know, 16 years ago,

2316
02:16:00,981 --> 02:16:05,981
gave him d in His coffee and the two of
those animals would be like down in the

2317
02:16:05,991 --> 02:16:06,441
coffee.

2318
02:16:06,441 --> 02:16:09,770
Well getting all jacked up on caffeine
and I'd be standing in the gym waiting

2319
02:16:09,771 --> 02:16:13,100
for them being like, oh my God, like
hanging out with these too, you know,

2320
02:16:13,101 --> 02:16:17,990
for the next two hours ramped up on,
on a fat and coffee,

2321
02:16:17,991 --> 02:16:22,650
which is basically the Dave Asprey concept
of like Yak butter tea and you know,

2322
02:16:22,910 --> 02:16:25,050
fat and things like that.
So the bulletproof concept.

2323
02:16:25,070 --> 02:16:29,410
So Larry used to start to mess around
with elements to add to the caffeine for

2324
02:16:29,411 --> 02:16:30,370
the performance.

2325
02:16:31,030 --> 02:16:34,570
And then we had a guy that we work with,

2326
02:16:35,110 --> 02:16:38,110
I think for about three years he'd, we'd
have guys come over and they'd be like,

2327
02:16:38,111 --> 02:16:39,850
Hey,
can you make me one of those coffees?

2328
02:16:40,030 --> 02:16:42,400
And after a while they'd start
sending me emails like, well,

2329
02:16:42,401 --> 02:16:45,010
how much coconut and how much of
this and how much that did he put in.

2330
02:16:45,490 --> 02:16:46,690
And our friend Paul was like,

2331
02:16:46,691 --> 02:16:50,230
do you mind if I try to put it together
in a formula? And I was like, yeah,

2332
02:16:50,231 --> 02:16:52,780
whatever. And it wasn't with the
intention of having a business.

2333
02:16:53,500 --> 02:16:56,680
And then before you know
it, it came out. And, uh,

2334
02:16:56,681 --> 02:17:01,030
so then we have like original creamer
with unsweetened, there's Tumeric,

2335
02:17:01,031 --> 02:17:04,420
there's hydrate products. Um, you know,

2336
02:17:04,421 --> 02:17:09,421
it's all based on things that
layered really eats and uses and,

2337
02:17:09,941 --> 02:17:12,850
uh, you know, mushroom
blends that I actually put,

2338
02:17:12,851 --> 02:17:15,940
that's how I do my coffee in the mornings.
I put that in and, and do that. So,

2339
02:17:16,770 --> 02:17:17,020
you know,

2340
02:17:17,020 --> 02:17:20,170
that's another good example of like if
you're doing something because you really

2341
02:17:20,500 --> 02:17:24,290
believe in it and really, um,
and that business has, um,

2342
02:17:24,640 --> 02:17:28,990
we're really fortunate. It's, we
have a factory in sisters, Oregon,

2343
02:17:28,991 --> 02:17:32,560
and they built another one and,
wow. Yeah, no, it's, we have no,

2344
02:17:32,561 --> 02:17:37,150
like they do everything that no
co-packing partners. We do it. And, uh,

2345
02:17:37,180 --> 02:17:41,200
now we're looking into farming ingredients
and doing a drying factory so we can

2346
02:17:41,410 --> 02:17:45,790
do that and put that into the product
and things like that. So, I don't know,

2347
02:17:45,791 --> 02:17:49,990
I think it started from a genuine
passion and, and, and came into that.

2348
02:17:49,991 --> 02:17:54,710
And you know, I always say too, like I
started, I was playing volleyball at a t,

2349
02:17:54,750 --> 02:17:56,320
you know,
in college at 17.

2350
02:17:56,500 --> 02:18:00,190
And then I started working and was
sort of doing other jobs by 18 or 19,

2351
02:18:00,760 --> 02:18:03,230
but layered his path has
been really different.

2352
02:18:03,320 --> 02:18:07,270
And really he didn't get in
surfing. People like these
new, maybe new Hillard was,

2353
02:18:07,271 --> 02:18:10,930
he was sort of always on the outside,
but then it's,

2354
02:18:11,680 --> 02:18:15,760
it's really, he was like 35 years old
when someone from the outside went, oh,

2355
02:18:15,761 --> 02:18:20,500
that's Kinda cool. So 35 would be
considered old, I think for an athlete.

2356
02:18:21,070 --> 02:18:22,630
And I think it's somebody who thought,

2357
02:18:22,930 --> 02:18:25,840
I have something inside me
telling me to go forward.

2358
02:18:25,870 --> 02:18:29,530
And I think that I feel that same way.
Like people have said to me like, well,

2359
02:18:29,531 --> 02:18:32,770
why did you do this or that? I go,
cause I could feel it inside. It's like,

2360
02:18:32,771 --> 02:18:37,060
you know that from what you do because
you've done a lot of different things and

2361
02:18:37,061 --> 02:18:41,920
um, and just kind of not
only trying to develop that,

2362
02:18:42,340 --> 02:18:46,600
but try to trust it and
say, even though I've, I've,

2363
02:18:47,740 --> 02:18:50,770
you know, it, I don't see
it all clearly right now.

2364
02:18:51,310 --> 02:18:54,250
I feel it and I'm gonna just
keep following that feeling.

2365
02:18:54,640 --> 02:18:59,230
And it doesn't always lead to some
grand destination, but maybe that,

2366
02:18:59,440 --> 02:19:04,360
those lessons and that place leads you
to the next, which could be, you know,

2367
02:19:05,340 --> 02:19:08,800
the place that you know, brings
you other things. So yeah,

2368
02:19:08,801 --> 02:19:11,890
these businesses are just a
natural byproduct of our lifestyle,

2369
02:19:12,460 --> 02:19:16,100
but it's pretty great. It's
pretty awesome. It's stuff.

2370
02:19:16,210 --> 02:19:19,180
I didn't start drinking coffee
till I was 45 really? Yeah.

2371
02:19:19,181 --> 02:19:21,670
Cause I Laird would be like,
cause I think he was like,

2372
02:19:21,671 --> 02:19:24,550
try this one and try that and try this.
I like to caffeine.

2373
02:19:24,551 --> 02:19:27,040
I just wasn't into coffee.
How would you take it?

2374
02:19:28,010 --> 02:19:31,610
Like you're Rahmati teams and stuff. I get
all jacked up on that side, that stuff.

2375
02:19:31,611 --> 02:19:33,140
You ever drink that stuff?
It's good stuff.

2376
02:19:33,141 --> 02:19:34,850
You better go straight
to whatever you're doing.

2377
02:19:35,360 --> 02:19:38,150
Because I have a year Mamata and I'm
like, tell me kids, you get your stuff.

2378
02:19:38,151 --> 02:19:40,690
We are in the car, you have your
bags. And they're just like, dude,

2379
02:19:40,960 --> 02:19:44,720
did you have a year? Bramante you
know, like you're a crazy person. So,

2380
02:19:45,070 --> 02:19:49,370
and now I've switched to the
caffeine with the fats. Um, but I,

2381
02:19:49,670 --> 02:19:53,480
I like it and I liked the business
aspect of it quite frankly. Like for me.

2382
02:19:53,481 --> 02:19:57,170
That's interesting too,
you know. Well thank you.

2383
02:19:57,620 --> 02:20:00,740
I'll send you more on podcasts.
Do you do podcast?

2384
02:20:00,980 --> 02:20:04,910
I had a podcast with Neil Strauss
and just stopped doing it. Yeah.

2385
02:20:04,911 --> 02:20:08,870
Neil's a busy guy. And, uh, we had
a podcast, we did it in the sauna.

2386
02:20:09,770 --> 02:20:11,810
We called the truth barrel.
That's what it was called.

2387
02:20:11,811 --> 02:20:14,750
We were literally in the sauna in
our bathing suits because our group,

2388
02:20:14,751 --> 02:20:18,440
when we get together, we were, we would
sit in the sauna and you know this,

2389
02:20:18,441 --> 02:20:21,440
if you have friends over, you go, hey, you
know what, I'm having love problems. Okay,

2390
02:20:21,441 --> 02:20:24,650
we got eight minutes because 200 degrees,
like let's get into it.

2391
02:20:24,890 --> 02:20:27,830
You're half naked, so you're
sort of, there you are.

2392
02:20:28,280 --> 02:20:32,570
And so I got an invitation
to do a podcast. And so I
saw Neil and I are so very,

2393
02:20:32,571 --> 02:20:36,490
very different, like
really different. And uh,

2394
02:20:36,950 --> 02:20:40,870
I thought it'd be more interesting to
have us with our points of view. Um,

2395
02:20:41,190 --> 02:20:44,210
and cause then you also realize that
as different as we are is we're really

2396
02:20:44,211 --> 02:20:46,940
looking for the same things.
We're trying to figure out love.

2397
02:20:46,941 --> 02:20:50,840
We're trying to be parents, we're trying
to work, take care of ourselves, age,

2398
02:20:50,841 --> 02:20:52,550
whatever,
all this stuff you're navigating.

2399
02:20:53,120 --> 02:20:55,460
And so we did that for like a year
and a half. It was a lot of fun.

2400
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,280
And people like in there
in their bathing suit,

2401
02:20:58,281 --> 02:21:02,030
sweating at my house in the sauna in
the truth barrel because that's what we

2402
02:21:02,031 --> 02:21:06,680
always called it. You can't lie in the
sauna like 10 minutes long. Now we would,

2403
02:21:06,770 --> 02:21:09,620
we would open the door.
Oh but it was like an,

2404
02:21:09,621 --> 02:21:14,020
I tried to turn it way down cause Laird
has our sauna two to 2120 go in there

2405
02:21:14,190 --> 02:21:17,900
cook. No it's exactly right.
But if you coupled with the ice,

2406
02:21:17,901 --> 02:21:20,780
you're sort of grateful for
the two 20 so I would turn it,

2407
02:21:20,840 --> 02:21:24,440
I tried to turn it down to like one 20
and inevitably the next day when it was

2408
02:21:24,441 --> 02:21:28,310
our real life Sonim alerts like who's
been messing with the dial in my sauna?

2409
02:21:28,311 --> 02:21:30,530
You know, it's like this whole thing
and I'm like, well, we were shooting,

2410
02:21:30,531 --> 02:21:33,740
we can't sit in there for an hour. You
see people, they're like, can I go out?

2411
02:21:33,741 --> 02:21:37,070
And they jump in the pool and then
come back in. It was really fun.

2412
02:21:37,820 --> 02:21:42,290
I liked it because there's something
like you just get right to it. Right?

2413
02:21:42,710 --> 02:21:46,010
Well why don't you just do it on your own?
You know what Joe,

2414
02:21:46,040 --> 02:21:49,580
I listened to your podcast
a lot and I think to myself,

2415
02:21:50,780 --> 02:21:52,430
very few people can do what you do.

2416
02:21:52,820 --> 02:21:57,110
I think it's really important to not
only like recognize when someone does

2417
02:21:57,111 --> 02:22:01,010
something really well cause
everyone thinks I could do
that. It's like, well, no,

2418
02:22:01,011 --> 02:22:03,620
you can't actually. Um, and so for me,

2419
02:22:03,621 --> 02:22:06,320
I'm very curious about
people and you know,

2420
02:22:06,321 --> 02:22:08,810
I used to do a lot of TV
where I'd interview athletes.

2421
02:22:08,840 --> 02:22:12,660
Like that was more interesting to me
than being interviewed because, um,

2422
02:22:13,130 --> 02:22:16,670
that's how you've learned.
Like you go, okay, how do you
do it? I know how I do it.

2423
02:22:16,671 --> 02:22:20,140
I don't need to know that I need
to know what you're doing. And, um,

2424
02:22:20,990 --> 02:22:24,620
I just think it's, it
does interest me, but I,

2425
02:22:24,680 --> 02:22:27,030
I would want to do it right.
Um,

2426
02:22:27,090 --> 02:22:30,270
and not just assume like you can
do it because to do it really well,

2427
02:22:30,350 --> 02:22:34,590
it's a special talent. Uh, I
just had a lot of practice.

2428
02:22:34,670 --> 02:22:36,750
We'd go back and listen to the early ones.
They sucked.

2429
02:22:36,970 --> 02:22:39,960
Just you just get better at it.
Yeah. No and I get that too.

2430
02:22:39,990 --> 02:22:41,520
But I think it's just knowing,

2431
02:22:41,610 --> 02:22:45,720
I think this is important in all things
in life because we like something not,

2432
02:22:45,780 --> 02:22:47,010
not maybe for me,

2433
02:22:47,011 --> 02:22:51,900
because I do really like this is just
because we like something doesn't mean we

2434
02:22:51,901 --> 02:22:52,950
have to do that too.

2435
02:22:53,550 --> 02:22:58,170
Like I think it's still like drilling
down on, you know, what do you want to do?

2436
02:22:58,380 --> 02:23:02,370
Like, cause when I hear you, you go
from a comedian to like a scientist,

2437
02:23:02,371 --> 02:23:04,260
a physicist to, you know, it's like,

2438
02:23:04,950 --> 02:23:09,390
it shows your genuine
passions in all these areas.

2439
02:23:09,570 --> 02:23:11,310
And that's what's interesting.

2440
02:23:11,340 --> 02:23:14,550
I mean I always want to talk
about like how do you get it done?

2441
02:23:15,060 --> 02:23:16,890
I'm so interested in how people,

2442
02:23:16,920 --> 02:23:21,920
if they can arrive at any place where
there's a sense of like joy moving in and

2443
02:23:22,021 --> 02:23:25,110
out of their life and self care.

2444
02:23:25,650 --> 02:23:28,980
And because I think when people talk
about health and fitness or wellness,

2445
02:23:30,090 --> 02:23:33,870
I think they're off the mark about
what it really is. I think for me,

2446
02:23:33,871 --> 02:23:35,010
what I've learned is like

2447
02:23:36,600 --> 02:23:41,040
I train in eat well just so I have a
fighting chance to support any kind of

2448
02:23:41,041 --> 02:23:45,990
happiness. Um, and it isn't just
about like I'm ripped, you know,

2449
02:23:45,991 --> 02:23:49,680
not me, but like the notion of what people
are putting out there that fitnesses.

2450
02:23:49,680 --> 02:23:51,270
It's like that's all great,

2451
02:23:51,570 --> 02:23:54,330
but if you still haven't figured out
some of these other things as a person,

2452
02:23:54,331 --> 02:23:59,160
it's like, I don't know. It seems like
you're wrestling the wrong things.

2453
02:23:59,220 --> 02:24:04,220
So I'm always really interested in and
also in not only how they get it done,

2454
02:24:05,730 --> 02:24:10,620
but also not making it seem like it's so
easy. You know? It's like when people,

2455
02:24:10,621 --> 02:24:13,680
I always joke, like when
people do interviews and they
go, how are your children?

2456
02:24:14,400 --> 02:24:19,050
Oh my God, they're amazing. And
I'm like, my kids are amazing too.

2457
02:24:19,051 --> 02:24:21,300
And they,
you know,

2458
02:24:21,540 --> 02:24:25,710
crush our balls on daily basis and
isn't that everybody's house, you know,

2459
02:24:25,950 --> 02:24:30,270
or people who say to me, I mean,
do you alert ever fight? Um,

2460
02:24:30,960 --> 02:24:34,800
I mean we have and we haven't
always had perfect, you know,

2461
02:24:34,801 --> 02:24:38,280
like there's been times where it was like
maybe we're not going to stay together.

2462
02:24:38,520 --> 02:24:41,850
And I guess for me that would be really
interesting is to communicate in a way

2463
02:24:41,851 --> 02:24:44,940
that's like, it's not gratuitous
but at least like, hey,

2464
02:24:44,941 --> 02:24:49,470
you're being kind of honest
about like what it is,

2465
02:24:49,740 --> 02:24:53,130
you know? And, and, and
now like I'm almost 50,

2466
02:24:53,131 --> 02:24:56,190
it's like even aging,
like having a,

2467
02:24:56,250 --> 02:25:00,990
having a realistic but good conversation
about like, hey, how's that going?

2468
02:25:01,410 --> 02:25:05,820
You know, not like I feel
great. I do feel great. I do,

2469
02:25:05,850 --> 02:25:10,260
I feel great. I'm sure you do. But there
are days where you, you go, oh time,

2470
02:25:10,320 --> 02:25:14,190
a real human time's moving.
I said sometimes I say that
teleric cause you know,

2471
02:25:14,191 --> 02:25:18,630
you don't want to be that wife. Do I look
all too? It's like he doesn't notice.

2472
02:25:19,260 --> 02:25:22,290
You know what I mean? I say,
I said today, it was funny,

2473
02:25:22,291 --> 02:25:26,140
I had a thing like I realized like
time's moving and he goes [inaudible]

2474
02:25:27,780 --> 02:25:30,430
because he knows what that
means and I'm sparing him that

2475
02:25:30,680 --> 02:25:33,050
conversation cause that's like
a girlfriend conversation.

2476
02:25:33,051 --> 02:25:35,060
That's like not one that
you have with your partner.

2477
02:25:35,540 --> 02:25:38,150
I think it's important to like,
you know,

2478
02:25:38,180 --> 02:25:40,160
go down the hole with
them on other things.

2479
02:25:40,880 --> 02:25:42,710
I do observe that sometimes
I look outside and I go,

2480
02:25:42,711 --> 02:25:44,840
yeah this is not a conversation
you want to have with Laird.

2481
02:25:45,620 --> 02:25:49,040
Save that for you know,
your, your girlfriend.

2482
02:25:49,600 --> 02:25:51,190
You have so much to say.

2483
02:25:51,191 --> 02:25:55,960
I think it's like a natural progression
for you to do another podcast for di to

2484
02:25:55,961 --> 02:25:57,490
do your own.
I don't know,

2485
02:25:57,510 --> 02:26:01,700
so much bouncing around like
I'm so boring to not boring. No,

2486
02:26:01,720 --> 02:26:04,180
I swear to God I've,
I feel like, you know,

2487
02:26:04,470 --> 02:26:06,310
it's probably cause you
think about yourself so much,

2488
02:26:06,311 --> 02:26:08,770
you're probably annoyed that
you thinking about yourself.

2489
02:26:09,330 --> 02:26:13,480
Try to fix this and change that
and adapt here and evolve their,

2490
02:26:14,110 --> 02:26:15,990
you know,
if you're really paying attention,

2491
02:26:16,500 --> 02:26:19,080
even a decent athlete is,
is like I was just trying to,

2492
02:26:20,220 --> 02:26:25,020
I was just trying to get it and I know
as a human we can never get it right and

2493
02:26:25,021 --> 02:26:26,100
that's a moving target.

2494
02:26:26,910 --> 02:26:31,910
But I feel like the pursuit of trying
to be one's best self in the is is

2495
02:26:33,541 --> 02:26:38,010
probably worth spending some time on.
Um,

2496
02:26:38,080 --> 02:26:42,280
you, you appreciate your existence
more I think when you are on that path.

2497
02:26:43,250 --> 02:26:44,540
I think so.
And I think,

2498
02:26:45,020 --> 02:26:48,350
I think especially when you've had the
opportunity also to do a lot of really

2499
02:26:48,351 --> 02:26:53,090
cool stuff and must think it becomes
a responsibility because you're not

2500
02:26:53,091 --> 02:26:57,710
fighting certain fights, like
certain battles. You don't even have,

2501
02:26:57,890 --> 02:27:01,190
like I don't have to, I have three
jobs, but I chose three jobs.

2502
02:27:01,400 --> 02:27:06,400
It's not like you're just trying
to survive like those people.

2503
02:27:06,831 --> 02:27:10,040
It's like, Hey, I get it. But I
felt like if you go like, Hey,

2504
02:27:10,041 --> 02:27:13,130
I got to do that and this and this. It's
like, yeah, cool. What are you doing?

2505
02:27:13,880 --> 02:27:17,210
Like what, what else are
you going to do? You know,

2506
02:27:17,600 --> 02:27:21,550
I think that that becomes a worthy task.
And I,

2507
02:27:21,551 --> 02:27:25,910
and also like I'm trying to stay in my,
I'm trying to stay married,

2508
02:27:25,911 --> 02:27:28,970
I'm trying to be a decent mom,
things like that.

2509
02:27:29,780 --> 02:27:32,240
And so that takes probably some work.
Well it does,

2510
02:27:32,241 --> 02:27:36,470
but I really think that there's value
in expressing that and that you do.

2511
02:27:36,530 --> 02:27:40,910
Yes I do. Yeah. I'm sure a lot of people
are agreeing right now like, yeah,

2512
02:27:40,920 --> 02:27:43,280
do a podcast. You know
what it is. This is what I,

2513
02:27:43,281 --> 02:27:45,980
my ultimate hope would be is that somehow,

2514
02:27:45,981 --> 02:27:50,510
and this is I think why I love your show
because I hear it over and over and you

2515
02:27:50,511 --> 02:27:55,100
don't say it per se of saying it, but
it's there always in an underlying way.

2516
02:27:55,730 --> 02:28:00,730
It's like power and love always like be
your most Badass self all the time that

2517
02:28:02,541 --> 02:28:04,220
you can have fun,

2518
02:28:04,221 --> 02:28:09,221
kick ass and maybe behind like for me
those are the ultimate because every,

2519
02:28:12,110 --> 02:28:14,570
all the people that I
see lower, I'm like, oh,

2520
02:28:14,810 --> 02:28:19,790
they could kick your ass and love you.
You know,

2521
02:28:20,840 --> 02:28:22,340
I that's really powerful.

2522
02:28:22,460 --> 02:28:25,430
I mean, I respond to that
because it, you know,

2523
02:28:26,960 --> 02:28:31,310
it feels important right now.
I think you're absolutely right.

2524
02:28:31,311 --> 02:28:33,980
I think this is a good way to
end this. Okay. Let's do it.

2525
02:28:34,480 --> 02:28:37,250
[inaudible] so thank you. Thanks for
being here. I really appreciate it.

2526
02:28:37,310 --> 02:28:41,180
I really enjoyed it. Thank you.
