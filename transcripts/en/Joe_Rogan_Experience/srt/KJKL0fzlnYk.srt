1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,080
Five,
four,

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:04,150
three,
two,

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,230
ladies and gentlemen,
live and available right now.

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:10,520
Everlast,
Whitey Ford.

5
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:13,130
How's a pain you?
Yes sir.

6
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:14,570
How are you sir?
How are you doing,

7
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:15,360
man?
Good.

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,193
Seeing you again in a minute.
You're going to vegas this weekend for 

9
00:00:17,841 --> 00:00:18,561
the fights?
Yeah,

10
00:00:18,561 --> 00:00:20,150
man.
We got a little party the night before.

11
00:00:20,151 --> 00:00:23,630
We were doing a little show at the 
Brooklyn bowl with my buddy evidence.

12
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:27,260
And you don't know where I put the 
headphones.

13
00:00:27,261 --> 00:00:29,000
I feel like I'm alone here with the 
headphones on.

14
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:29,863
There we go.
Here we go.

15
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,120
Now we're on the same team.
Now we're locked in.

16
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,580
Um,
does this out?

17
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:35,271
This is out,
right?

18
00:00:35,271 --> 00:00:37,160
Yeah,
it came out about three weeks ago,

19
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:38,420
something like that.
Maybe a month.

20
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:39,643
Beautiful.
I've been in Europe for the whole month 

21
00:00:40,661 --> 00:00:41,494
is touring.
So this is like everything everlast 

22
00:00:44,001 --> 00:00:46,940
presents Whitey Ford's house of pain.
Yeah.

23
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:47,783
It's,
it's,

24
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:50,870
it's everything in the toolbox I brought
to this record.

25
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:52,820
So that's Kinda where the title came 
from.

26
00:00:52,821 --> 00:00:53,660
Just,
you know,

27
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,270
it's been eight years since my last real
studio album,

28
00:00:56,271 --> 00:00:58,940
so I figured,
hey,

29
00:00:58,941 --> 00:01:01,100
maybe this could be the last one.
I hope not,

30
00:01:01,101 --> 00:01:02,710
but just like,
you know,

31
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:03,441
I mean like,
you know,

32
00:01:03,441 --> 00:01:04,340
that my story,
it's like,

33
00:01:04,341 --> 00:01:05,660
you know,
with the family,

34
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:07,610
I dedicate a lot more of my time to the 
family.

35
00:01:07,611 --> 00:01:08,570
Then I used,
yeah,

36
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,050
I'm just because of some of the,
you know,

37
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:11,923
um,
extra issues we deal with which 

38
00:01:13,311 --> 00:01:14,990
everything is wonderful and great.
Now,

39
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:16,250
you know,
and dude,

40
00:01:16,251 --> 00:01:18,990
I'm 30 pounds lighter than the last time
I was here to do that.

41
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,370
Honestly,
it started here because I,

42
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:24,740
I put,
I purposely came here that day.

43
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,540
It was the first time,
if you remember,

44
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:29,690
it was awhile ago and you've done a 
thousand podcasts since that day.

45
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:30,770
But,
uh,

46
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:31,603
it was the first time I had come out and
they started talking about anything 

47
00:01:33,381 --> 00:01:33,830
like,
you know,

48
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:36,290
that was going on in my life in a public
way.

49
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,250
And uh,
you know,

50
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:43,230
I got a lot off my chest that day and I 
also plan that day to,

51
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:46,820
to put myself in a position to hold 
myself accountable by this,

52
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,660
by stating I don't feel good about the 
way I look right now.

53
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:55,280
And I reached out for like,
theoretically for help,

54
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,193
you know,
and I got an incredible response from 

55
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:58,963
the podcast audience and my own fans and
I mean I got offered from everybody 

56
00:02:01,941 --> 00:02:03,740
everywhere how to do this,
that and the other.

57
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:04,963
Um,
didn't really need that because within 

58
00:02:06,831 --> 00:02:10,940
my own circle some people stepped up and
I also did it to hold myself accountable

59
00:02:10,941 --> 00:02:13,040
to put it in the universe.
Like I've thrown it out there,

60
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:17,240
I put it up there on the wall and snip 
and stamped it and said,

61
00:02:17,241 --> 00:02:18,950
here's what I want out of life right 
now.

62
00:02:18,951 --> 00:02:22,150
And you know,
there's nobody stopping me but me and at

63
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:22,993
sometimes some of the things I used to,
I used to get on and see you talking 

64
00:02:25,491 --> 00:02:28,280
about I'm not letting this inner bitch 
kicked my ass today.

65
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:30,740
And I just started taking things like 
that to heart,

66
00:02:30,741 --> 00:02:32,080
you know.
And again,

67
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,800
after she changed.
What'd you do different?

68
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,190
We started talking about it last time in
therapy.

69
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,053
You know what I mean?
It's helped a lot for me because of 

70
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:40,310
this,
you know,

71
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:40,821
the,
the,

72
00:02:40,821 --> 00:02:41,654
the added pressures are family faces 
with my oldest daughter having cystic 

73
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:46,670
fibrosis,
you know,

74
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:49,850
it just for a long time it was just 
learning how to live life with it,

75
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:51,560
you know,
and that got heavy.

76
00:02:51,561 --> 00:02:53,090
There was some real dark,
you know,

77
00:02:53,091 --> 00:02:54,110
heavy moments,
you know,

78
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,210
scary moments for her in the hospital,
you know,

79
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,830
so we,
I mean as a human,

80
00:02:57,831 --> 00:02:58,664
you know,
you have this baby and you're just 

81
00:03:01,091 --> 00:03:05,980
trying to figure out how to not screw it
up with a normal health situation,

82
00:03:05,981 --> 00:03:07,720
you know,
this is this added thing.

83
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:10,510
So it took a long time for me to come to
terms.

84
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:12,790
At first I got really angry.
I got into some real,

85
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:13,763
you know,
Lieutenant Dan more with God kind of 

86
00:03:15,221 --> 00:03:16,030
stuff,
you know,

87
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,760
at the top of the sail boat flipped,
you know,

88
00:03:18,761 --> 00:03:22,420
as I was there all the way.
And it got to a point where I almost,

89
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:23,483
I was at,
I almost got locked up for trying to 

90
00:03:24,491 --> 00:03:25,680
fight a cop that was,
you know,

91
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:28,990
trying to just talk to me about 
something,

92
00:03:28,991 --> 00:03:30,140
you know,
I just lost my job.

93
00:03:30,141 --> 00:03:30,974
I had no,
I had so much anger over so much that I 

94
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:35,614
wasn't dealing with.
And then I found a guy that really got 

95
00:03:38,141 --> 00:03:40,310
me therapists and,
and it,

96
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,600
it began the,
the,

97
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,720
the ball rolling of understanding how 
to,

98
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:46,540
how to cope with a lot of that stuff.
Wow.

99
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,890
So,
um,

100
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,540
as far as like,
first of all,

101
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:52,270
you look really good.
Think your face looks great,

102
00:03:52,271 --> 00:03:53,170
your skin looks good.

103
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:56,080
I'm taking a lot better care of myself.
It looks like it.

104
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:56,980
Thank you.
Are you,

105
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:57,813
what are you doing different as far as 
like how you eat or I'm just eating 

106
00:04:00,551 --> 00:04:01,410
cleaner,
you know,

107
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,590
just trying not to,
you know,

108
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:03,463
uh,
to be more aware of what's in the food 

109
00:04:04,601 --> 00:04:05,980
and listen to the meat and stuff.
You know,

110
00:04:05,981 --> 00:04:08,680
I'm still part of the whole commercial 
meat system though.

111
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:09,514
I long to to,
to get it to a situation where I'm 

112
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,420
hunting and doing things like that.
It's just,

113
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:17,060
we had talked about that for 100 to try 
hunting pigs at a to hone,

114
00:04:17,061 --> 00:04:17,894
right.
I asked you what would be the best 

115
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:21,400
starting point and you were like,
you know,

116
00:04:21,401 --> 00:04:22,234
they got bore up there.
Well to hone and I know some guys and I 

117
00:04:24,281 --> 00:04:27,070
actually contacted them and I just,
again,

118
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,540
this is so busy.
It's not just this,

119
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:31,690
it's the added stress of like,
you know,

120
00:04:31,691 --> 00:04:33,490
I have a wife that when I go on the 
road,

121
00:04:33,491 --> 00:04:36,730
she's the sole handler of these 
problems,

122
00:04:36,731 --> 00:04:37,270
you know what I mean?

123
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:41,920
And so that these things pile on you 
guilt and stress and all this,

124
00:04:41,921 --> 00:04:43,150
you know.
And um,

125
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,580
so yeah,
it's just between that and when I'm home

126
00:04:45,581 --> 00:04:47,260
I just invest myself.
I want to be home,

127
00:04:47,261 --> 00:04:49,300
I want to do as much as I can to lift 
that weight.

128
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,270
So like I get caught by the things,
all the things I want to do,

129
00:04:52,271 --> 00:04:53,770
I can't do all the time,
you know what I mean?

130
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,873
But it started again.
Now I'm taking care of myself like I'm 

131
00:04:56,621 --> 00:04:58,480
actually about to start Jujitsu again,
you know,

132
00:04:58,481 --> 00:04:59,530
which.
Yeah,

133
00:04:59,531 --> 00:05:00,364
because I forever,
I was so goddamn fat in the middle of 

134
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,493
hip escapes.
We're like,

135
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,333
you know,
I was hurting my back or my neck every 

136
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:07,960
other time I tried to do,
I just quit because it was getting,

137
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:09,011
you know,
I mean,

138
00:05:09,011 --> 00:05:10,180
I wasn't,
we were advanced.

139
00:05:10,181 --> 00:05:12,280
I was probably pretty close to getting a
blue belt,

140
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,140
you know,
that was about a year in,

141
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,410
on like four lessons a week with just 
the private.

142
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,970
I was with mark,
as Vanessa said,

143
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,223
Beverly Hills Jujitsu for a while.
So now I'm just looking to see what I 

144
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:24,631
want to do.
You know,

145
00:05:24,631 --> 00:05:26,950
I've talked to Eddie a few times.
I'm talking to a few other guys.

146
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:31,951
Cron has taught you doing any exercise 
at all besides that?

147
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,500
Cardio.
Not much weights or anything like that.

148
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,080
Just,
you know,

149
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,710
keep it moving.
I two hour,

150
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,350
two hours on stage tonight.
It's good to do something first.

151
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:43,200
Uh,
I feel like a,

152
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:47,250
I always tell people like Jujitsu,
so grueling that I,

153
00:05:47,251 --> 00:05:47,791
I think,
uh,

154
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:48,311
why?
I mean,

155
00:05:48,311 --> 00:05:50,720
you could just jump in and you will get 
in shape through Jujitsu,

156
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,573
but a good thing to do is find a place 
that teaches you kettlebells and take 

157
00:05:56,111 --> 00:06:01,111
some Kettlebell and just just get your 
body strong enough that it can remember.

158
00:06:01,581 --> 00:06:03,610
One of the things marcus used to do 
brought marcus,

159
00:06:03,611 --> 00:06:04,444
used to run me around the gym for 30 
minutes before we could even start a 

160
00:06:07,281 --> 00:06:07,610
lesson.

161
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:10,460
Like I literally had to Puke for the 
first like month.

162
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:11,780
Yeah.
That's that old school way.

163
00:06:11,781 --> 00:06:14,690
A lot of it would take so long that he 
would be like,

164
00:06:14,691 --> 00:06:15,524
all right,
you're past the puking thing you ran 

165
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:17,084
into.
But it was like at first I would like 

166
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,083
literally be run till I was puking.
Then the crazy part of ours is 15 

167
00:06:23,121 --> 00:06:26,060
minutes after you felt great when you 
were doing the last thing,

168
00:06:26,061 --> 00:06:27,770
so it was it all work.
Yeah.

169
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,330
Those.
The old school guys,

170
00:06:29,331 --> 00:06:30,164
that's how they used to do at these two.
I'm like all the old school Carlson 

171
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:35,990
gracie classes,
you'd have a grueling physical workout,

172
00:06:35,991 --> 00:06:38,870
first hip escaped pushups,
sit ups,

173
00:06:38,871 --> 00:06:40,730
bodyweight squats,
all this different stuff.

174
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:43,100
There's a good thought process behind 
that,

175
00:06:43,101 --> 00:06:43,934
not just that it gets you in shape,
but also that you learn how to do 

176
00:06:46,161 --> 00:06:46,994
Jujitsu when you're tired so that you 
learn how to just use technique and not 

177
00:06:50,481 --> 00:06:53,750
use like you're almost have no choice 
but to relax.

178
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,613
Yeah,
yeah,

179
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,110
yeah.
There's a people that disagree with that

180
00:06:57,111 --> 00:06:57,944
though.
They think you should learn technique 

181
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:01,760
when you're fresh in it,
like sits and better,

182
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,950
but it's just two different schools of 
thought.

183
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:05,533
I don't think either one is right.
It's definitely good to understand what 

184
00:07:08,211 --> 00:07:11,630
it's like to be tired and how to,
how to train and how to,

185
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,640
how to push yourself when your tire 
shore.

186
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,170
Yeah.
I'm excited.

187
00:07:15,171 --> 00:07:16,004
I'm really looking forward to it.
Like I just started talking about like 

188
00:07:18,741 --> 00:07:20,160
about two weeks ago.
Really getting back to,

189
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:22,100
well that's a lot of weight to lose,
man.

190
00:07:22,101 --> 00:07:25,670
That's a big accomplishment.
I got 15 to go to really to hit my goal.

191
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:28,070
Yeah.
Will it be 2:25

192
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,400
to 25?
So you good?

193
00:07:29,401 --> 00:07:30,370
Wait.
Yeah.

194
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:34,750
I'm taking vitamins or supplements or 
anything along those lines.

195
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:35,850
Like a daily.
Um,

196
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:36,531
but I,
you know,

197
00:07:36,531 --> 00:07:39,650
I have restrictions because I take blood
thinners and stuff because of titanium,

198
00:07:39,651 --> 00:07:40,484
heart valve I have so like I have to 
have a vitamin that's devoid of a 

199
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:46,250
vitamin K because that's what makes your
blood clot.

200
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,113
So I like a lot of things,
like a lot of the juicing things and 

201
00:07:49,161 --> 00:07:50,870
like things like that when you want to 
go on a juice cleanse,

202
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:51,704
I can't do it because it's like a lot of
it's Kale based and like Kale is heavy 

203
00:07:55,521 --> 00:07:56,354
green with it's high in vitamin K,
it'll totally screw up my blood 

204
00:07:59,511 --> 00:08:00,360
chemistry with,
you know,

205
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,480
because I'm going the other direction 
with blood thinners.

206
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:03,863
Jesus Christ,
I have to otherwise like a clock could 

207
00:08:05,601 --> 00:08:08,240
hit,
like stick to that titanium valve,

208
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,310
break off and wind up in my brain,
you know what I mean?

209
00:08:10,311 --> 00:08:13,100
And then Tom stroked out and that's the 
last thing we need.

210
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,083
Fuck yeah.
I remember when you put the microphone 

211
00:08:15,531 --> 00:08:17,740
up to your heart and you can hear that.
Yeah.

212
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:18,603
I would say I'm so,
so like when I'm in here I've keep 

213
00:08:20,281 --> 00:08:22,040
feeling like you can hear it anyway.

214
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,690
It's like all through this.
I hear it.

215
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,760
Twentieth white noise to me.
If I want to hear it,

216
00:08:25,761 --> 00:08:26,594
I can hear.
I can take my pulse like this just by 

217
00:08:27,501 --> 00:08:28,990
telling you.
Wow.

218
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:30,770
Very.
You can feel it.

219
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:34,570
I can hear it in my own skull.
Like I could hear it in my bones that it

220
00:08:34,571 --> 00:08:35,600
can hear it.
It's in me.

221
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:36,820
How long is that?
Good for?

222
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,061
Forever.
Forever.

223
00:08:38,061 --> 00:08:42,080
As long as I take care of him.
I mean it's been 20 years.

224
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,093
Literally in,
in 2018 it happened 90 or [inaudible] 

225
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:47,020
98.
And um,

226
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,140
I just get,
you know,

227
00:08:48,141 --> 00:08:50,680
as long as I keep the thinning,
the blood thinners going and you know,

228
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,553
I get checked in,
you know,

229
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,940
two times,
three times a year,

230
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:56,100
you know,
and then the blood thinners it because

231
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:00,000
if you got a clot it would somehow or 
another get stuck in that valley or,

232
00:09:00,001 --> 00:09:01,350
or you know,
it.

233
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,980
It's a titanium valves to the clock 
could actually form on it that the metal

234
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:08,610
like it could book.
If it's the bloods to sticky into it has

235
00:09:08,611 --> 00:09:10,400
too much claude.
He could stick to the bow,

236
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,660
then break off and then wind up in your 
brain,

237
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:16,770
you know.
So to avoid blood clots in general.

238
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:17,623
Yes.
What's the difference between that and 

239
00:09:18,971 --> 00:09:21,330
the regular regular valve?
What would happen to the regular?

240
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:22,923
The other choice would have been a pig 
valve and those are good for about 15 

241
00:09:25,351 --> 00:09:27,840
years.
Like they used to open you up again?

242
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:28,290
Yeah,
yeah.

243
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:30,000
I would have had to have it.
I'd probably be do.

244
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,690
Yeah,
probably right now to like,

245
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:32,970
I'd be like,
go here.

246
00:09:32,971 --> 00:09:33,631
I don't know.
Yeah,

247
00:09:33,631 --> 00:09:35,860
they do that for older people is what 
they do.

248
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:36,390
Could like,
you know,

249
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:38,140
when you get into your sixties they,
you know,

250
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,920
really explore that because they don't 
think you're going to be around $50.

251
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,700
Right.
They just say here just for now.

252
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:45,371
Yeah.
So,

253
00:09:45,371 --> 00:09:46,830
um,
it's called a St Jude's.

254
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:52,050
St Jude's artificial valve.
Powerful medical technology.

255
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:54,870
Any brothels got a titanium disk in his 
back now?

256
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,520
Yeah.
He just had a surgery this,

257
00:09:56,521 --> 00:09:57,061
right?
Yeah.

258
00:09:57,061 --> 00:09:58,680
His back moves around.
Great.

259
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:01,770
It like he was fully compressed.
Whether it was like nothing left.

260
00:10:01,771 --> 00:10:02,604
It was basically bone on bone.
He was in pain all the time and they 

261
00:10:05,431 --> 00:10:07,510
just opened them up and put a fake valve
in there.

262
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:08,813
Crazy fake disc rather in there,
but it's articulating so like moves 

263
00:10:12,241 --> 00:10:14,660
around like a regular desk.
His,

264
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,650
it doesn't.
It's not like he's fused.

265
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,100
Even if you're seeing people that are 
off.

266
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:19,043
Yeah,
they get the few.

267
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,300
I have a friend who got that down.

268
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,630
Yeah,
they're super stiff.

269
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:24,450
Like wherever it is is basically locked 
down.

270
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:27,190
There's no movement to it anymore,
but Eddie's is,

271
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:30,160
is actually moves like a real desk for 
shoot.

272
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,700
That's going to be coming down the 
pipeline is going to be crazy,

273
00:10:32,701 --> 00:10:33,540
man.
Yeah.

274
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:35,160
I mean I know people with fake 
everything.

275
00:10:35,161 --> 00:10:39,120
I know people with fake hips and knees 
and what's fake?

276
00:10:39,121 --> 00:10:40,710
Heart valves.
Heart valves.

277
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,760
Yeah.
Yeah.

278
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:42,683
It's amazing.
I mean at a certain point in time 

279
00:10:44,761 --> 00:10:45,594
they're just going to replace your whole
body and take your brain out and put it 

280
00:10:47,551 --> 00:10:50,100
into your skin to be able to download 
your consciousness.

281
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:54,870
That's what ellen was saying,
had gotten mad trouble.

282
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,380
He didn't really.
They made it.

283
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,450
Made some noise,
man.

284
00:10:58,610 --> 00:10:59,490
But here's the deal,
Dude,

285
00:10:59,491 --> 00:11:01,320
when you got $25,
billion dollars,

286
00:11:01,321 --> 00:11:03,360
all trouble is bullshit.
Truth.

287
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:05,160
It's like,
good luck with your trouble.

288
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,373
Trouble.
He's out there with a fucking flame 

289
00:11:09,451 --> 00:11:11,940
thrower shooting rocket ships into the 
atmosphere.

290
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,940
That flame throwers crazy too.
Does whatever he wants,

291
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:16,990
man.
He's basically like a little kid who.

292
00:11:16,991 --> 00:11:19,830
And you actually buy that.
Is that like not anymore hail.

293
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:23,360
There's one right there.
Oh yeah.

294
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,330
He sold them all out like in like two 
days or something.

295
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:30,230
I don't doubt it.
I would've had him in hip.

296
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:33,360
What are you going to do with it though?
Just fun.

297
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,253
It's just you have a flame thrower,
but it's literally called not a flame 

298
00:11:37,981 --> 00:11:38,814
thrower.

299
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,520
Yeah,
it's amazing.

300
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,740
Yeah.
It's basically what you saw in the movie

301
00:11:43,741 --> 00:11:44,574
aliens movie.
The second angle when they're shooting 

302
00:11:46,141 --> 00:11:48,750
the flames at the aliens.
That's what that thing is.

303
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,053
Yeah.
I seen him on something just the other 

304
00:11:50,821 --> 00:11:51,654
day almost.
Was it here where it looked like you 

305
00:11:52,821 --> 00:11:54,450
were going set the building on fire?
Yeah.

306
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:55,720
That was in here.
Yeah.

307
00:11:55,721 --> 00:11:56,980
That was all my instagram.
Yeah,

308
00:11:56,981 --> 00:11:59,710
he's a mad man.
The world needs more of those,

309
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,710
more people like him,
not more flame throwers.

310
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:07,210
Know plenty of philanthropists.
So,

311
00:12:07,211 --> 00:12:08,044
uh,
you looking forward to the fights this 

312
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,620
weekend?
I'm,

313
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,870
I'm super jacked for it man.
Oh dear.

314
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:15,190
We got this little show before.
Is anybody coming out to jump around?

315
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,750
Um,
I don't know.

316
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,040
They have to.
They,

317
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,870
you know,
I'm waiting for Connor.

318
00:12:19,871 --> 00:12:23,200
Did you know how does he not know that 
song?

319
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:24,910
Well,
he comes out to Sinead O'connor,

320
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:27,970
right?
That he does like usually like that into

321
00:12:27,971 --> 00:12:30,850
like the notorious song,
like the,

322
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:31,743
you know,
the.

323
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:32,681
Yeah.
I don't know,

324
00:12:32,681 --> 00:12:34,240
but no Pto Rias.
Right.

325
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:39,560
Or who was coming out to jump around?
Marcus Davis did.

326
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,780
He did.
I know,

327
00:12:40,781 --> 00:12:41,970
uh,
uh,

328
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:44,710
Coviello that,
that the female fighter.

329
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:48,400
Uh,
she coveo thank you.

330
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,140
Yeah,
I know she comes out to jump around.

331
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:52,090
I met her at a fight.
She was super cool.

332
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:52,953
She was super troopers will get called 
quite a few people have come out to it 

333
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,290
and I think Machida came out to at once.

334
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,270
He's over in belt right now.
I'm not,

335
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,270
I'm not always sure they have a choice 
sometimes.

336
00:13:04,271 --> 00:13:06,410
I just think Dana says you're coming out
the job.

337
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,330
Well,
he definitely takes away bad choices.

338
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:15,310
That might be what might be the sub when
there's a really shitty here.

339
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,173
Throw that in.
But then Darren till came out to sweet 

340
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:20,890
caroline.
He came out to uh,

341
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,510
who is that Neil?
Diamond diamond.

342
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:24,420
Yeah.
And he had the whole crowd singing along

343
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:25,390
like,
this is crazy.

344
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:26,283
Crazy.
Was it,

345
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:28,840
was that in Boston or in that area of 
the country?

346
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,160
No,
it was,

347
00:13:30,161 --> 00:13:31,270
uh,
where was that fight?

348
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:33,520
Chicago.
Chicago.

349
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,420
Makes Sense.
Neil diamond wasn't in Chicago.

350
00:13:35,421 --> 00:13:39,190
It could,
it could know Dallas was Dallas.

351
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:43,170
That's should've came up.

352
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:46,660
Yeah,
it was weird.

353
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:48,470
It was weird.
Yeah.

354
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,560
It's just like,
you know,

355
00:13:50,561 --> 00:13:53,260
that's a big deal.
Like walkout songs are a big deal.

356
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,770
You can't have a wag.
Sets the tone.

357
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,390
The thing for me is when I hear one of 
my songs,

358
00:13:58,710 --> 00:13:59,950
I'm just,
I'm just always like,

359
00:13:59,951 --> 00:14:00,401
oh,
please.

360
00:14:00,401 --> 00:14:05,401
When you saw him becomes a curse.
It's like,

361
00:14:05,551 --> 00:14:06,550
Oh man,
come on.

362
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,190
Jon.
Anik does stats on fist bumps,

363
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:10,323
like how many times people fist bump 
bruce buffer whether or not they win or 

364
00:14:12,461 --> 00:14:13,640
lose.
You know,

365
00:14:13,641 --> 00:14:14,474
like,
and Diego Sanchez broke the curse and 

366
00:14:15,971 --> 00:14:19,450
his last fight he fist bumped bruce any,
any one?

367
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:23,380
So the fist bump was a cursed.
We're trying to figure it out cause he,

368
00:14:23,381 --> 00:14:27,100
he was like,
I think it's like 50 slash 50 right now,

369
00:14:27,101 --> 00:14:27,934
like whether or not people when they 
fist bump priest buffer when they went 

370
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:31,263
and there was a bad streak for awhile,
like three or four people in a row last 

371
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,160
that we're fist bumping,
you know,

372
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:37,970
bruce gives you the intro,
you know,

373
00:14:37,971 --> 00:14:38,680
uh,
you know,

374
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:42,440
and when he gives you the Dji go a 
nightmare,

375
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,710
she's a little fist bump and if you fist
bump them back,

376
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:48,360
you know,
if you,

377
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,193
if you do engage in that,
like Anik was trying to figure out like 

378
00:14:52,071 --> 00:14:56,930
Anik is kind of a degenerate gambler in 
the most positive way.

379
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,810
I mean he's not losing his family or his
life,

380
00:14:59,811 --> 00:15:00,644
but he fucking loves gambling.
And so he's always giving you stats on 

381
00:15:03,411 --> 00:15:08,360
this and that is something to put a on 
things he actually bets on.

382
00:15:08,361 --> 00:15:11,150
But he's always thinking that way.
Would you bet on it?

383
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,043
Yeah.
I wonder if you could bet on how many 

384
00:15:14,271 --> 00:15:18,020
people who fist bump bruce buffer,
you could find somebody to take the bet.

385
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,033
The thought process would be you're not 
totally in the zone if you've got the 

386
00:15:21,111 --> 00:15:24,710
time to fist bump bruce buffer.
I'm not sure if it buy it though,

387
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:28,470
because it's also your moment when 
you're saying your name and.

388
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,470
Yeah.
I don't know.

389
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,600
It's a tricky,
tricky.

390
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:38,483
Well,
it sounds like it's about even just one 

391
00:15:40,311 --> 00:15:41,144
of them things.
Someone should do stats on it because 

392
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:44,810
Jon Anik is only done like a,
you know,

393
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:48,470
just off the top of his head in his 
basement right now.

394
00:15:48,471 --> 00:15:52,190
Starting.
Starting to watch the fight for sure.

395
00:15:52,191 --> 00:15:53,240
Write it down.
Okay.

396
00:15:53,241 --> 00:15:54,390
Let's take the notes.
Well,

397
00:15:54,391 --> 00:15:56,180
you can basically bet on anything these 
days.

398
00:15:56,181 --> 00:15:57,014
Right?
In Vegas you can pretty much find a lot 

399
00:16:00,051 --> 00:16:00,884
of things.
I think you could bet on you that you 

400
00:16:02,391 --> 00:16:04,520
can.
I don't even bet,

401
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,950
but I liked the fact that you can bet on
everything.

402
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:10,790
Why Not Anders coin flips.
Also,

403
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:11,624
I liked that it's freedom.
I don't like this idea that people are 

404
00:16:13,911 --> 00:16:15,860
telling you what you can and can't do 
with your money.

405
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:17,780
Like you can't gamble your money.
Well,

406
00:16:17,781 --> 00:16:19,250
you have to go to a spot in the desert.

407
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:22,440
Like why says who says,
oh,

408
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:25,690
like why can't you gamble right here?
Why can't someplace,

409
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,533
you know,
why can't you have a casino on every 

410
00:16:27,531 --> 00:16:29,000
corner?
Who Cares?

411
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:30,111
Like,
well,

412
00:16:30,111 --> 00:16:34,940
people are going to lose our paycheck on
wolves are family and one was really,

413
00:16:34,941 --> 00:16:35,774
really well.
They really is that what's going to do 

414
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:40,070
it?
So at the casino maybe be for a while,

415
00:16:40,071 --> 00:16:41,630
but then people will be like,
you know,

416
00:16:41,631 --> 00:16:46,160
we shouldn't go there as much as like 
the infant tyler [inaudible] of people,

417
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,900
you know,
keep them,

418
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,793
protect them from themselves.
You don't protect them from liquor 

419
00:16:50,751 --> 00:16:52,430
stores are fast cars,
you know,

420
00:16:52,431 --> 00:16:54,320
those things were everywhere.
Everywhere.

421
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:55,340
Good point,
right?

422
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:58,100
Yeah.
I'm with you man.

423
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,200
I could never live in Vegas.
Oh,

424
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:04,010
I could live in Vegas.
You know,

425
00:17:04,011 --> 00:17:08,150
if it was between Beirut and Vegas,
Vegas,

426
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:09,590
do it.
I'll figure it out.

427
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:11,680
But you know,
it just,

428
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:15,140
it seems to me like this.

429
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:16,003
Just the whole thing is it's built.
I mean there's shows and it's wonderful 

430
00:17:20,021 --> 00:17:22,730
and as neon there's great restaurants 
and all that stuff,

431
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:26,310
but it's also built on you losing money.
Yeah.

432
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:29,600
The whole thing is built on you losing.
When's the real population of Vegas?

433
00:17:29,601 --> 00:17:30,434
Like a half a million people like that 
of people that aren't there visiting 

434
00:17:33,771 --> 00:17:36,800
gambling and for the fuckery.
Let's take a guess.

435
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:39,440
I'm guessing like half a million people.
Yeah,

436
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,650
I bet you're about right.
Six,

437
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:43,840
600,
30,000.

438
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,770
I'm pretty far off.
Pretty close.

439
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:48,170
That's a good guest.
How would that have been?

440
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:52,880
Close enough to win the price is right.
Yeah,

441
00:17:52,881 --> 00:17:56,190
so if you've got a real small town there
that's acting like a city too.

442
00:17:56,191 --> 00:17:58,060
It's kind of weird.
Well,

443
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,950
like what is the population at any given
time with all the hotels filled?

444
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:07,600
This weekend's a big week,
at least dolt more than that probably,

445
00:18:07,601 --> 00:18:10,380
but I'm saying at least even like an off
season,

446
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:10,830
off day.

447
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:11,663
You're probably at least double that,
but a lot of the folks that work in 

448
00:18:14,341 --> 00:18:16,500
Vegas,
they live in like Henderson or something

449
00:18:16,501 --> 00:18:18,800
like that where you can go and a nice 
neighborhood.

450
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:22,770
Kids can ride bikes in the street.
It's like normal for there to uh,

451
00:18:22,771 --> 00:18:24,050
uh,
summerland too.

452
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:26,710
That's really nice over there.
Yeah.

453
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:28,650
There's a few of those spots that are 
like,

454
00:18:28,651 --> 00:18:30,240
no,
actually like staying over there at that

455
00:18:30,241 --> 00:18:31,074
red rock.
That's not the don't like the Strip 

456
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:34,253
fuckery,
man.

457
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,910
That's why I like,
you know,

458
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:37,783
just seemed like a quiet.
If I want the fuck where y'all take a 

459
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:39,883
cab over 40 minutes away.
She says there's one and a half 90 

460
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:47,400
people there at any given time.
Probably more like that.

461
00:18:47,401 --> 00:18:49,410
Yeah.
So for the fights,

462
00:18:49,411 --> 00:18:52,170
what about a big fight weekend I typed 
in for hotels.

463
00:18:52,171 --> 00:18:53,640
How many people were in that hotel 
rooms?

464
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:56,940
Yes.
There's a 148,000

465
00:18:56,941 --> 00:18:57,960
rooms.
Whoa.

466
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:01,500
Do they might be 148,000
Irish people there this weekend.

467
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,350
Just screaming if you,
you're.

468
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:07,860
If you're there this weekend,
just pay attention because it's going to

469
00:19:07,861 --> 00:19:10,590
be bananas.
The last time for the mayweather fight,

470
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:11,483
there was a video that someone posted of
Mandalay Bay and Mandalay Bay was not 

471
00:19:15,131 --> 00:19:15,964
anymore.
The fight was taking place and the irs 

472
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:22,460
had this one hallway completely filled 
and they were all singing.

473
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:26,400
They were singing dot avenue in New 
York.

474
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:27,900
They don't give a fuck.
Yeah,

475
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:30,063
England.
So little islands all got on a plane to 

476
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:36,090
fucking crazy and there's a lot of us 
here too,

477
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:36,980
you know,
and I say us,

478
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:43,340
I got a little in me one quarter.
There's so many more Irish or Irish part

479
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,820
Irish people in America.
There's more than.

480
00:19:47,821 --> 00:19:50,310
There are Irish people in Ireland.
They did a lot of fucking.

481
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,533
They came over here and did a lot of fun
and they fought and they weren't 

482
00:19:53,341 --> 00:19:56,380
discriminated about color or creed 
anymore.

483
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,510
Jamie's got a notorious tee shirt on 
with the Irish flag savage.

484
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,460
Is that available at Young Jamie Dot 
Com?

485
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:04,350
There's a link there if you need it.
Oh my goodness.

486
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:05,850
Powerful commerce.

487
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,900
I would have tried this whiskey 
honestly,

488
00:20:09,901 --> 00:20:11,000
that he's got.
I've got.

489
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:11,970
I got it.
I got it.

490
00:20:11,971 --> 00:20:13,230
Yeah.
You're a whiskey expert,

491
00:20:13,231 --> 00:20:14,064
right?
I wanna I wanna lay hands on it and see 

492
00:20:15,421 --> 00:20:17,410
what's a good whiskey.
I was,

493
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:21,030
I actually was going to bring you a 
bottle of this and I will next time,

494
00:20:21,031 --> 00:20:24,690
but I didn't because of Celebrex for 
sober October,

495
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,610
maybe falling apart.
I'm going to tell you right now,

496
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,793
gentlemen,
Burke crushers going on a cruise and 

497
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,810
ours should fear and Tom both gave me 
the green light to drink because uh,

498
00:20:33,811 --> 00:20:36,390
this fitness challenges falling apart.
Meanwhile,

499
00:20:36,391 --> 00:20:39,600
Bert is strongly in last place.
Yeah.

500
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:41,890
All that.
Talk about the Mickey Mantle Gene.

501
00:20:41,891 --> 00:20:45,030
He's not even close.
But what's fascinating is red shift.

502
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,560
Fear is very close to me.
He's only,

503
00:20:47,561 --> 00:20:51,490
he posted today before my workout.
That's sneaky bitch that he was ahead of

504
00:20:51,491 --> 00:20:53,140
me,
but that's how close he is.

505
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:54,303
He's so close that before his workout,
he was like 100 points ahead of me 

506
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:01,630
before my workout rather after his.
Now he's like 400 points behind me,

507
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,480
but that's a,
that's close.

508
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:08,200
Four hundred points is one workout.
If you're an asshole and you want to get

509
00:21:08,201 --> 00:21:12,310
on a fucking treadmill for two hours,
you can bang out 400 points.

510
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,190
I banged out 500 today.
Five.

511
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:16,024
Oh,
seven at the end of the workout 

512
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:19,150
therapies to.
It's not a beast,

513
00:21:19,151 --> 00:21:20,020
man.
It's boring.

514
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:23,140
Registered watching.
I was watching a gladiator.

515
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:26,770
There's little red spikes in my workout 
where I hit 93.

516
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,633
That's when the fights were happening.
I got amped up to a podcast while you 

517
00:21:32,111 --> 00:21:34,210
were on a elliptical commanded that 
month.

518
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,720
It would suck.
Redbreast is my favorite new whiskey.

519
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,340
Redbreast.
Who makes that?

520
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,293
It's red breast is the second Irish 
whiskey and get to come and bring you 

521
00:21:43,781 --> 00:21:45,090
about another 20 year old.
It's.

522
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:47,110
It's gorgeous.
Twenty years old.

523
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,333
It's beautiful.
What was that shit that we drank with 

524
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,490
Stan?
Hope that was really good.

525
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:52,510
Was it Stan?
Hope?

526
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:53,630
No.
Stand up.

527
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,610
Stand home.
Brought it and doesn't some band make it

528
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,790
at the Florida Georgia line or some 
shit.

529
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:01,803
Did they make it?
Is that there's no like a pop band and 

530
00:22:06,301 --> 00:22:08,350
they make a good whiskey like a country 
band?

531
00:22:08,351 --> 00:22:10,590
I think country pop,
whatever.

532
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:12,130
Old Camp.
Listen man.

533
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,950
If you call yourself country,
but you get them fake rips and Eugene's,

534
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:18,770
you can go suck a bag of depth.
That ain't country.

535
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:25,360
Not saying that they have that.
I don't even know,

536
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:28,440
but you know what I'm saying?
Like those fake grips in the genes might

537
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:31,110
have a couple of little groups in my 
teens do.

538
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:33,990
I checked those fake grips drive me Damn
Banana Bananas.

539
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,730
Like what are we were pretending that we
work hard.

540
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:37,963
What are we pretending that we.
We've had these jeans for a long time 

541
00:22:40,481 --> 00:22:43,330
and they're special to us.
Or did we just buy them off the shelf at

542
00:22:43,331 --> 00:22:46,390
macy's?
Pre ripped like assholes.

543
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,333
Like where the fuck did that take place?
Like if our grandparents who made it 

544
00:22:50,171 --> 00:22:51,004
through the depression could come over 
here and see us buying rip jeans would 

545
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:57,040
they would realize like,
what is wrong with this nerfed up soften

546
00:22:57,041 --> 00:22:59,710
down fucking shitty country.
We live in America.

547
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:00,943
It's too easy,
too easy to get by wolves in the 

548
00:23:04,541 --> 00:23:06,700
streets.
Young Eric.

549
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:11,910
We can't be running around with fucking 
fake rips in jeans.

550
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:17,290
You know on Brendan Schaub.
One of my best friends does that.

551
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:18,303
Oh,
who's this?

552
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:20,830
That's them with the five.
Nailed it.

553
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,580
I didn't even mean to nail it.
I didn't even mean that.

554
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:27,940
I just took a wild guess.
I don't know a goddamn thing about these

555
00:23:27,941 --> 00:23:29,620
fellows.
Go to that other one.

556
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:34,000
Go to that last picture.
We put the glasses on and look at.

557
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,740
Look at those genes.
Make that bigger.

558
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:38,620
Well,
he looks like he got a shark.

559
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,360
I got some paint.
Oh,

560
00:23:40,361 --> 00:23:43,330
you do have some gray.
Got Some fucked up shit on your jeans.

561
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:45,291
I'm gonna.
I'm gonna.

562
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:46,520
Keep it real though.
I'm not gonna.

563
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:51,470
Let you go in on them and not come claim
my jeans here.

564
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:52,910
Listen,
I should shut the fuck up.

565
00:23:52,911 --> 00:23:56,180
I'm basically wearing yoga pants.
I got these barbell jeans on.

566
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,460
These aren't even jeans.
These are Goddamn Yoga pants.

567
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,760
Jeans,
or made a weird like this thing.

568
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:01,730
I mean,
well these don't.

569
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:03,350
These aren't even Jesus.
Actually Denim.

570
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:05,810
These are like they.
They might as well be spandex.

571
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,490
I might as well be wearing yoga pants 
most,

572
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:10,230
most pants or that now.
Even the ones that look like jeans and a

573
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,700
lot of them are that they feel better.
Technology,

574
00:24:13,701 --> 00:24:16,370
it's called advancement in human 
civilization.

575
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,233
Yeah.
You want to drive a car with leaf 

576
00:24:17,841 --> 00:24:18,674
springs like an asshole or do you want 
some new magnetic Cadillac escalades 

577
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:27,380
Vung like to cruise through your pants 
or you want to be sweaty?

578
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:32,400
All the breeze from fake holes.
I'll take the sweat like a man.

579
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:41,930
I want to rock my because I got skinny 
enough to where these motherfuckers.

580
00:24:41,931 --> 00:24:42,960
Okay.
I respect that.

581
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,780
Wifey.
Your fastest links.

582
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:47,310
These motherfuckers.
Well that's two.

583
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:50,180
Two pluses.
Just don't wear cowboy boots.

584
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:52,650
Oh,
we jay.

585
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:56,840
We rocking the sneakers for life to my 
friend Cam Haynes.

586
00:24:56,841 --> 00:24:59,000
He wears cowboy boots and I just shut my
mouth.

587
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,393
Look down those big old woodland hills.
I think Andrew Sandino's bit never seen 

588
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:04,334
Andrew Sandino's,
but he's got a bit about dudes who wear 

589
00:25:06,141 --> 00:25:07,910
cowboy boots.
Holy Shit.

590
00:25:07,911 --> 00:25:09,750
Is it funny?
Oh my God.

591
00:25:09,751 --> 00:25:10,584
I'll look it up on the to it.
I don't even know if he might not even 

592
00:25:12,951 --> 00:25:17,060
put it on a special yet,
but he's a whole bit about dudes dressed

593
00:25:17,061 --> 00:25:19,310
up like with cowboy hats on and cowboy 
boots.

594
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:22,760
Fucking hilarious.
Anyway,

595
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:23,623
but I digress.
What's this a cow skull with the third 

596
00:25:26,631 --> 00:25:27,650
eye.
What's that?

597
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,600
Just a sweatshirt or liked.

598
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,730
Okay.
I like it too.

599
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:36,150
It's one of those brand called 
adaptations interested.

600
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:37,910
It has a fake colon.
The elbow.

601
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,620
Oh Jesus.
Sorry Dude.

602
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,750
This full disclosure.
I'm not going.

603
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,980
I'm not going to tell the truth.
Why is that happening with the holes?

604
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,580
How did that happen?
What happened to us?

605
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:49,830
Sorry Dude,
I'm disappointing you so much.

606
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:52,550
The reality is,
and this is what's fucked up,

607
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:53,413
why does it look better?
Because it Kinda does kind of looks 

608
00:25:56,031 --> 00:25:59,020
better if you wearing a shirt and it's 
got like even if it's a new shirt,

609
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,830
it's got like those little holes around 
the collar,

610
00:26:00,831 --> 00:26:03,020
a little tiny holes,
like a little bit.

611
00:26:03,021 --> 00:26:03,854
A little bit of rip here.
A little tiny rip their why's it look 

612
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:06,561
better.
I don't know.

613
00:26:06,561 --> 00:26:07,394
Maybe it's because it's not.
Maybe there's some psychological way of 

614
00:26:09,411 --> 00:26:12,260
ripping things that some people are more
talented at it,

615
00:26:12,261 --> 00:26:14,720
that they just know where to make cool.

616
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:19,780
They make it look like if you had like a
pair of Levi's that were the.

617
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,400
He was getting thin,
we would advance that shit.

618
00:26:22,401 --> 00:26:23,390
You know,
there was something cool.

619
00:26:23,391 --> 00:26:24,224
Yeah.
You would like if it was like we didn't 

620
00:26:25,281 --> 00:26:27,200
do it on like rip them up like they do 
nowadays,

621
00:26:27,201 --> 00:26:29,540
but like let's say you had a pair of 
jeans long enough,

622
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:31,710
they know the knees would get thin and 
they ripped a little.

623
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:32,573
You just kind of run with it.
Maybe stress him out a little bit more 

624
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:39,410
like that.
Oh well presenting the $1,625

625
00:26:39,411 --> 00:26:41,630
designer tee shirt complete with tears 
and holes.

626
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:42,643
Okay.
We can all agree if you buy that you're 

627
00:26:45,001 --> 00:26:47,850
a fucking asshole.
If you spent a thousand dollars on a tee

628
00:26:47,851 --> 00:26:48,684
shirt,
you're kind of.

629
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:49,683
The only good thing about that is I 
think that's the lady's tee shirt and 

630
00:26:51,511 --> 00:26:52,344
I'm holding bumped them and all she has 
to do is bend over tire shoes and it 

631
00:26:57,151 --> 00:26:58,710
might not be a nip slip.

632
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:01,050
It might be a nip poke through.
Right?

633
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:01,913
Like look where those holes are.
Quite possibly those ties are jutting 

634
00:27:05,431 --> 00:27:06,570
out.
Right?

635
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,450
Look at that.
You know how that works too.

636
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,290
She might not even be wearing that 
shirt.

637
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,860
That might not even be a person.
That might be a mannequin.

638
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,593
Yeah.
They do things and they just put 

639
00:27:16,291 --> 00:27:18,580
different shirts on.
Shit would photoshop and shit that.

640
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,970
It's crazy.
But that's a stupid shirt.

641
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:23,790
That's a shirt.
Like this one.

642
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:28,910
There's a t shirt that has a button down
shirts sewn to the front of it.

643
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,833
What's dude?
It was like on the blogs a couple of 

644
00:27:32,941 --> 00:27:34,580
weeks ago.
You know what I'm talking about.

645
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:37,980
So he's in the sneaker blogs using some 
of that shit.

646
00:27:37,981 --> 00:27:38,814
It leaks through and shit.
So I'm like be using like these greg's 

647
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:45,510
designer crazy.
I have a couple pairs but I don't really

648
00:27:45,511 --> 00:27:46,344
wear them that much.

649
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:48,043
I'm more of a Jordan guy.
You have a thought about lighting them 

650
00:27:49,891 --> 00:27:53,670
on fire sometimes.
Like when I was,

651
00:27:53,671 --> 00:27:56,490
you know,
the dudes kind of batshit crazy.

652
00:27:56,750 --> 00:28:01,020
I actually say that on his album.
Patching crazier than Yay.

653
00:28:01,021 --> 00:28:02,700
And Sarah Pailin.
Oh look at this.

654
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:04,350
Yeah,
that's a real thing.

655
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:06,840
Oh Lord.
That's a real thing.

656
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:11,870
So one side has a tee shirt and then the
other thing is sewn to the front.

657
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:13,651
But it like,
it doesn't even,

658
00:28:13,651 --> 00:28:16,770
it looks like it's hanging there.
It is just hanging there,

659
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,420
but it doesn't even look like you're 
wearing it.

660
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:22,910
It looks like it's running your shirt.
Oh,

661
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:23,790
what,
what?

662
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:25,110
Hold on.
Go back to that price.

663
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:28,210
$200.
$1,300

664
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,450
was saying that is worse than the 
teacher.

665
00:28:30,451 --> 00:28:31,230
You know,
buy one right now.

666
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:33,930
Oh my God.
$1,300.

667
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,460
Wow.
For that.

668
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:39,210
Do you see Kanye jumped on a table at a 
university,

669
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,880
was talking about leaving Elon musk 
alone.

670
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:44,130
Who's lost his mind?
Man?

671
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,780
What's going on?
I don't know man.

672
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,433
You know,
there's a lot of people that speculate 

673
00:28:48,391 --> 00:28:50,520
and that's all I would say.
This is from me.

674
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:54,300
Ever since that man's mother died,
he's been on a downward spiral,

675
00:28:54,301 --> 00:28:56,220
like losing his shit.
Well,

676
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,353
you know,
I think he's suffering from some 

677
00:28:58,201 --> 00:29:00,090
serious,
like no bullshit.

678
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:03,470
He did get into a serious car accident,
broke his jaw,

679
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,850
was seriously injured a few years 
before.

680
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,790
That is not a joke.
No.

681
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:11,520
Like brain trauma.
And listen,

682
00:29:11,521 --> 00:29:15,000
I'm not a doctor or anything even 
remotely related to one,

683
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,073
but I've been around.
A lot of people have been hitting the 

684
00:29:17,071 --> 00:29:19,800
head a lot.
That shit's real like that.

685
00:29:19,801 --> 00:29:20,634
That will change your brain chemistry.
It's a 100 percent legit like getting 

686
00:29:24,811 --> 00:29:28,860
hit in the head is no Bueno and car 
accidents will fuck people up forever.

687
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:31,050
Some people,
some people are okay.

688
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:33,000
They get they recover.
Boy,

689
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:33,863
there's a lot of people that come back 
for some significant head trauma and 

690
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:37,343
just they're scrambled man and he might 
be one of those and it also might be 

691
00:29:40,831 --> 00:29:42,820
what I talked about in my last special 
triggered,

692
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:48,640
but you lived with crazy bitches long 
enough to get something happens.

693
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:53,980
You were talking about the soul stealing
suck you buy might be true.

694
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:55,773
It was an amazing routine.
I got it while I was trying to figure 

695
00:29:58,571 --> 00:30:01,270
out a way that I get away with making 
fun of Bruce Jenner without being called

696
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:05,470
transphobic,
circuitous route.

697
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:07,640
It was brilliant.
Go along route.

698
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:10,930
First Time I saw it.
Yeah.

699
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:14,410
I had to drag Kanye in that to you,
dude.

700
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:18,180
Every mail that's gone into that circle,
into it.

701
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:23,590
Lost all it's spooky.
Borrowed them was like a world champion.

702
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:25,570
Yes.
Ballplayer dude.

703
00:30:25,571 --> 00:30:27,720
And he's got cracked out drag Bush.

704
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:31,750
What happened to him?
Reggie Bush got wise and detailed.

705
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:34,360
He's got my old car.
He.

706
00:30:34,361 --> 00:30:37,690
Reggie Bush has my 1970 Barracuda.
Is that right?

707
00:30:37,691 --> 00:30:38,411
Yeah.
Yeah.

708
00:30:38,411 --> 00:30:39,244
I sold it to this other dude and this 
other dude sold it to Reggie and he 

709
00:30:41,801 --> 00:30:43,780
drives around that car.
It's a dope car.

710
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:45,460
And he was a dope car.
Yeah.

711
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:46,323
So he's got some taste.
You have any weird things are going on 

712
00:30:49,391 --> 00:30:49,980
over there,
man.

713
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:52,570
He smashed and bolted.
That's how you do it.

714
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,150
And he's.
He smashed before the fake ass came into

715
00:30:55,151 --> 00:30:57,790
the picture too.
That's another phenomenon.

716
00:30:57,791 --> 00:31:02,791
I don't even understand diaper,
but it is like I'd like a nice round,

717
00:31:03,311 --> 00:31:06,070
but yeah.
Here's my car.

718
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:07,840
It was Reggie Bush driving.
It was not.

719
00:31:07,841 --> 00:31:10,190
My Card Says No.
Oh,

720
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:13,630
look at that Reggie.
Glorious Bastard.

721
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,730
You had her first.
Yeah.

722
00:31:15,731 --> 00:31:18,480
I'm not a really good car.
Good car.

723
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:19,640
Look at records.

724
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:20,920
Had to get rid of it.
Oh yeah,

725
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:26,100
that's the Ray j song.
Right in your window.

726
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:30,853
You go full circle.
You wouldn't want to take second place 

727
00:31:33,111 --> 00:31:33,944
to Reggie Bush to.
That guy is built like a brick shit 

728
00:31:35,181 --> 00:31:35,781
house,
you know,

729
00:31:35,781 --> 00:31:37,900
he was smashing that.
Right?

730
00:31:37,901 --> 00:31:39,880
Whatever he damaged.
He did that.

731
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:40,893
He probably was like a car accident.
Maybe all that fake ass shit came after 

732
00:31:44,021 --> 00:31:46,420
him.
You get hit by that dude I read.

733
00:31:46,421 --> 00:31:47,254
She used to wake up before him and get 
hot towels ready and put his toothpaste 

734
00:31:50,231 --> 00:31:51,670
on his toothbrush.
Smart.

735
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:52,833
Yeah.
Him like a king probably just smashed 

736
00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:58,030
it.
She's pot all day.

737
00:31:58,031 --> 00:32:00,730
Just delirious.
Just from all the orgasms.

738
00:32:00,731 --> 00:32:05,731
Just walking around,
bumping into walls and shit is a picture

739
00:32:07,061 --> 00:32:10,000
of him and her by the pool and you'd 
look at him and you love that guy.

740
00:32:10,001 --> 00:32:13,600
Must be just smashing that.
He's a super athlete.

741
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,810
I mean that guy is built like a fucking 
superhero.

742
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:18,670
All of them.
That's all they really date.

743
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:20,171
Yeah,
right.

744
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:21,280
For the most part.
Yeah.

745
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:23,990
Except Kanye.
Yeah.

746
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:29,250
She just settled down behind a 
basketball player to player.

747
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,070
Do the dude who was on the show all the 
time.

748
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:36,170
That guy was on the show all the time.
Crazy living.

749
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:39,710
I can't even see living your life like 
out there and fucking public.

750
00:32:39,711 --> 00:32:41,630
Just every fucking biddy or business.
Oh,

751
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,770
that would be a nightmare to me.
Well,

752
00:32:42,771 --> 00:32:47,771
it's also not interesting but yet edited
so well that you just go slack,

753
00:32:47,871 --> 00:32:48,704
jaw and you just watch.
It's just they switched from one scene 

754
00:32:50,931 --> 00:32:54,430
to another quick enough so that you keep
watching it and when it's over,

755
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:55,610
nothing happened.
Nothing.

756
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,010
And you're like,
what the fuck did I do with my hour?

757
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:58,933
You gave it to them and they advertised 
like 18 and products that they got paid 

758
00:33:02,811 --> 00:33:06,080
for it and they made a fucking ass load 
of money.

759
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,820
When you find out how much that family 
has made,

760
00:33:07,821 --> 00:33:08,421
you just go,
wait,

761
00:33:08,421 --> 00:33:08,740
wait,
wait,

762
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:09,560
what?
What,

763
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,000
what?
It's.

764
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:13,110
It's amazing.
Yeah.

765
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,720
Can't Karen.
Hey Ken.

766
00:33:14,721 --> 00:33:16,700
Hey Ken.
You should make fun.

767
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:18,320
Make Fun.
Make Fun.

768
00:33:18,321 --> 00:33:20,660
All days.
That's our God given,

769
00:33:20,661 --> 00:33:21,494
right?
Yes.

770
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:24,380
When you get that much money,
if I get that much money,

771
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:25,813
I can't even get mad.
No matter how much fun you can make it 

772
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,330
with me,
no matter what I do,

773
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:32,300
I could be a saint.
You still could make fun of me because I

774
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:34,160
got that much money.
Nobody.

775
00:33:34,161 --> 00:33:37,580
That's just the way it goes and you are.
I mean,

776
00:33:37,581 --> 00:33:39,560
you want to talk about someone out 
there.

777
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:42,740
Those fucking people are out there.
They got everything out there,

778
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:44,780
you know,
they're living like performance art.

779
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,023
They like living in a giant glass house 
on a pedestal in the middle of a city 

780
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,190
were almost.

781
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:53,750
That's where all that comes from though.
It was like,

782
00:33:53,751 --> 00:33:54,584
you know,
the fake ass isn't all that you gotta 

783
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:58,670
keep the spectacle alive almost.
You know what I mean?

784
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:02,620
If it's not a spectacle,
it's not interesting.

785
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:06,230
I have to keep changing things.
If it's not an absolute spectacle to the

786
00:34:06,231 --> 00:34:07,920
vision,
your,

787
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:11,780
your brain will catch onto the my 
favorite word fuckery.

788
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,420
I love that word too.
It's my favorite word.

789
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:16,130
It's a great word.
It's a good.

790
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:18,710
It really is like a great.
First of all,

791
00:34:18,711 --> 00:34:20,600
it's a word that you can get away with 
no matter what.

792
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:24,020
It's not a word that you know eventually
you won't be able to use anymore.

793
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,273
No,
fuckery is just going to be around 

794
00:34:26,181 --> 00:34:29,930
forever and it's just,
it is perfect for like nonsense.

795
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:33,350
Yeah.
I've been my English friends for years.

796
00:34:33,351 --> 00:34:35,420
We're saying fuckery on that.
That's the thing.

797
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:37,850
That's the only reason they catch none 
over here.

798
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:39,373
Really.
The last 10 years I'm talking about 

799
00:34:41,481 --> 00:34:42,314
since the eighties I been hearing 
fuckery trying to figure out when I 

800
00:34:44,091 --> 00:34:44,924
started using it,
I started using in regards to martial 

801
00:34:46,761 --> 00:34:48,350
arts,
like fake martial arts.

802
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,500
I use it in all kinds of stuff.
You can use it lightheartedly.

803
00:34:51,501 --> 00:34:54,350
You could use it seriously.
It was viewed everything.

804
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,450
It's as versatile as just plain old 
fuck.

805
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:57,650
Yeah.
Yeah.

806
00:34:57,770 --> 00:34:59,380
Steve Maxwell.
That's where I got it from.

807
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,080
Then I started using with Steve Maxwell.
He was describing some fake martial arts

808
00:35:03,081 --> 00:35:06,860
talking about cause you know Steve's a 
black belt in Jujitsu and he's like,

809
00:35:06,861 --> 00:35:08,480
yeah,
that's a lot of fuckery.

810
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:09,314
And I was like,
Ooh,

811
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:13,250
that's a great word.
That's a word I'm going to keep using.

812
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:14,803
I just looked it up to see if there's a 
good definition and it says it's also a 

813
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:19,100
definition for another word for a 
brothel.

814
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:21,270
A fucker.
Fuck.

815
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,633
Holy Shit Dude.
You're just like open my brain in a new 

816
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,570
way.
Cloris.

817
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,910
That's like,
Duh.

818
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,600
Of course they've called it.
Are you going to the fuckery?

819
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:39,620
A brewery fuckery.
Oh,

820
00:35:39,621 --> 00:35:41,810
that's too.
That's never.

821
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,790
That never would have dawned on me.
How vulgar,

822
00:35:44,791 --> 00:35:48,600
slang,
uncountable sexual intercourse.

823
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:50,030
What?
Wow.

824
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,620
That which is fucked up,
that which is fucked up,

825
00:35:55,290 --> 00:36:00,150
fucked up his definition.
It is a fuckery.

826
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:03,370
That is hilarious of fuckery.
Well,

827
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:08,470
I had only used it in its verb form.
It's actually a noun is a fuckery.

828
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:12,650
Fuckery.
A place place.

829
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,850
We get your.
That's brand new.

830
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,120
Literally brand new translation in 
French,

831
00:36:18,121 --> 00:36:20,410
I guess is what it says.
Oh,

832
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:23,280
French.
And they figured out shit.

833
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:25,710
Have you ever been to Paris?
I love Paris.

834
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:28,650
It's one of my favorite place underneath
it as all the skeletons.

835
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,450
No,
I have not been to the catacombs.

836
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,980
The Friends of mine have gone though.
Yeah.

837
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:32,814
I want to go man.
I want to go and see that you can get 

838
00:36:34,981 --> 00:36:36,240
tours and all kinds of shit.

839
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,073
Like what happened was that the people 
that died and the plagues that with it 

840
00:36:38,631 --> 00:36:40,350
is.
I think so.

841
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,470
And they just buried them,
you know,

842
00:36:42,471 --> 00:36:43,304
the um,
the church put them all in the 

843
00:36:46,711 --> 00:36:49,710
catacombs.
Do you know at one time Paris had a wolf

844
00:36:49,711 --> 00:36:53,730
problem and people getting killed by 
wolves in recent history?

845
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,620
$1,400.
Look at that.

846
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,940
Wow.
Look at those pictures.

847
00:36:56,941 --> 00:36:58,580
All those skulls.
Yeah.

848
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:02,590
There's a crazy story by habits will 
place that whenever I see pictures of.

849
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,080
This is the reminder.
There's a place in,

850
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:06,660
I want to say what countries?
Prague,

851
00:37:06,661 --> 00:37:10,010
the Czech Republic.
I think it's called Aura.

852
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:15,890
K U t n a h o r a.
it's like a church that's like thousands

853
00:37:18,211 --> 00:37:20,550
of peoples skeletons.
Grays.

854
00:37:20,551 --> 00:37:21,211
Yeah.
There it is.

855
00:37:21,211 --> 00:37:23,670
That's it.
That place is bananas,

856
00:37:23,671 --> 00:37:25,710
man.
Did you go to that too?

857
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,700
Oh No,
I've been there.

858
00:37:26,701 --> 00:37:27,534
I haven't been to the catacombs saying 
whenever I see pictures of the 

859
00:37:29,251 --> 00:37:30,084
catacombs,
but this place it's like an entire 

860
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:32,124
church decorated and then they have like
little dens of like places like 

861
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:36,750
thousands and thousands.

862
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:39,000
It was like vertebrae the spine.
Oh No.

863
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:42,940
There's another one where it's like,
Whoa,

864
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:47,010
crazy that is beneath the aura and it's,
you know,

865
00:37:47,011 --> 00:37:49,620
you can just go there and I think you 
pay like a couple of whatever.

866
00:37:49,621 --> 00:37:53,700
Euros and you can walk in there and I 
got tons of flakes in there.

867
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:57,420
It's weird when you go to those places 
and you realize these places with that.

868
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:58,263
Like I was in Italy and uh,
there was a church that I went to and 

869
00:38:01,801 --> 00:38:05,400
there was this glass floor.
The church was over a thousand years old

870
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:08,040
and is a glass floor that you walk on 
below.

871
00:38:08,041 --> 00:38:08,874
The glass floor is the old church that 
the thousand year old church was built 

872
00:38:12,991 --> 00:38:15,870
on and they have no idea how old old 
churches.

873
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:16,960
That's crazy.
Yeah.

874
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:19,890
Which church was it?
It's in Ravello.

875
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:25,250
It's at the top of like there's a bunch 
of cute little shops and little uh,

876
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,750
hotels and shit out.

877
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:28,583
So I make sure I check it out.
Small Church that the church that you 

878
00:38:32,071 --> 00:38:34,290
could visit is more than a thousand 
years old.

879
00:38:34,291 --> 00:38:35,124
I put a picture on my instagram of this 
crazy picture of what they thought a 

880
00:38:38,171 --> 00:38:42,910
whale looked like.
It was a story of a guy who was the dude

881
00:38:42,911 --> 00:38:44,740
who got eaten by the way on the Bible,
Jonah,

882
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:45,521
Jonah,
Jonah,

883
00:38:45,521 --> 00:38:49,690
and the whale.
And it's like in a mosaic on the wall,

884
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,600
but it's like what they thought a whale 
was.

885
00:38:51,601 --> 00:38:52,560
It's like,
you know,

886
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:53,403
before they had photos that some dude 
would like draw you a picture of some 

887
00:38:55,871 --> 00:38:58,720
shit he saw like this is what I will.
It looks like my friend.

888
00:38:59,110 --> 00:38:59,980
And then,
you know,

889
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:04,750
some other dude who never saw.
Well we'd make a mosaic of this shit and

890
00:39:04,751 --> 00:39:07,000
put it on the wall.
It's just so weird.

891
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:11,330
And we went to the place that got fucked
up by the volcano to um,

892
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:12,430
palm palm pay.

893
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,770
Yeah.
That's fascinating.

894
00:39:14,771 --> 00:39:15,604
Too.
Crazy.

895
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:21,130
Just instantly.
Twenty feet of ash just covered in Ash.

896
00:39:21,131 --> 00:39:23,520
Just can't even imagine.
Yeah.

897
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:25,660
One minute.
Nothing.

898
00:39:25,661 --> 00:39:27,160
And next one.
A little earthquake.

899
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:29,470
And why you're there.
You can see the volcano.

900
00:39:29,471 --> 00:39:31,120
It's right there.
So active.

901
00:39:31,121 --> 00:39:32,530
Yeah.
I don't know.

902
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:35,550
I mean I don't think it's had a real 
issue in a long time.

903
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:38,890
See if you find that instagram picture 
of Jonah and the whale.

904
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:43,030
That's scary shit from July volcanoes in
Hawaii.

905
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:44,750
Everything going on there.
Yeah.

906
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:45,850
That's Nutty,
man.

907
00:39:45,851 --> 00:39:50,480
Just scary getting the.
I read a story of like,

908
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:51,363
somebody didn't touch the lava,
they just got within like a couple 

909
00:39:53,651 --> 00:39:57,070
inches of it and like burnt themselves,
like melted their skin,

910
00:39:57,071 --> 00:39:58,120
like off.
Oh yeah.

911
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,230
Yeah.
Not even getting,

912
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:00,940
like actually hit by it.
You get hit by it.

913
00:40:00,941 --> 00:40:02,500
Your Shit's desolving.
Oh,

914
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:05,480
you can cook on it.
Just slap a stake on that bench.

915
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:07,910
It would dissolve,
wouldn't,

916
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:10,300
it wouldn't.
It's not the best conductor of heat.

917
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:12,400
You know,
you just slap a stake on that.

918
00:40:12,401 --> 00:40:14,110
Sear it,
flip.

919
00:40:14,111 --> 00:40:19,030
It may take one second.
There was a uh,

920
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:24,210
some crazy chef did this where they took
molten iron and they poured it down this

921
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:27,280
chute.
And as I was going down the chute,

922
00:40:27,281 --> 00:40:28,114
they slapped stakes on.
It was like they were cooking on this 

923
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:33,820
hot molten iron.
That's crazy.

924
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:37,450
People get bored.
Wonder if it tasted any protests.

925
00:40:37,451 --> 00:40:39,420
Like Shit.
Probably ruin a good steaks,

926
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:42,430
like multiple fucking whatever.
But yeah,

927
00:40:42,431 --> 00:40:43,264
like molten dirt.
Did you see the video of the lava 

928
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:47,763
consuming that Mustang?
Did you walk Haasz dissolved if you got 

929
00:40:51,851 --> 00:40:53,680
payments and you just fucking damn,
man,

930
00:40:53,681 --> 00:40:57,010
this car is killing me.
These payments at killing me just parked

931
00:40:57,011 --> 00:40:57,844
that bitch.
Why would that lava is coming in Hawaii 

932
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:03,040
watching get melted.

933
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,233
Set up a camera better.
Imagine there's a lot of mustangs over 

934
00:41:06,461 --> 00:41:07,294
there either.
I probably is a lot of American cars 

935
00:41:09,371 --> 00:41:10,101
over there.
They,

936
00:41:10,101 --> 00:41:10,934
they,
they buy a lot of toyotas because they 

937
00:41:12,731 --> 00:41:14,380
don't break.
They're small.

938
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:17,380
Yeah.
Well it's also like you don't do,

939
00:41:17,381 --> 00:41:19,630
you know,
everything has to get flown over there.

940
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:22,810
So you don't want anything to break 
superexpensive yeah.

941
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:23,973
Everything.
Food is more expensive there than like 

942
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:30,640
the only other place that it was 
comparable to me was Perth really?

943
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:33,140
Well because everybody.
So it's like everything is same day.

944
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:38,070
It's the furthest like city,
like isolated by itself in Australia and

945
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:42,410
I think maybe in the world away from any
other major city.

946
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:43,820
That makes sense.
Right?

947
00:41:43,821 --> 00:41:44,654
Because Australia is as big as the 
United States and it's really the only 

948
00:41:47,541 --> 00:41:50,460
major city on the west coast that you 
guys.

949
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,220
How big is Perth?
It's like,

950
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:55,080
I don't know how many people,
but it's like a city and know.

951
00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:57,440
Do you perform there a lot?
I'm not allowed to spend.

952
00:41:57,441 --> 00:41:59,630
Probably almost 10 years since I've been
in Australia.

953
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:02,390
I love Australia,
but I do not love that fucking flight,

954
00:42:02,391 --> 00:42:03,224
baby.
Tough.

955
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:04,850
That's a rough life.
Takes a minute.

956
00:42:04,851 --> 00:42:06,050
They'll get over that shit.
Yeah.

957
00:42:06,051 --> 00:42:07,100
You,
you land and you're like,

958
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:11,650
where am I for a couple of days.
There it is.

959
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:17,230
That's what the fuck is that man.
It's like a fish with a lion head.

960
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:19,640
Like,
look,

961
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,650
that's what they thought Jonah and the 
whale looked like.

962
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:23,840
That's hilarious.
Thousand years ago.

963
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:25,280
Strange,
right?

964
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:29,160
Like dude was trying to make a run for 
it and then look at emily was like,

965
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:31,720
I'm going to get the fuck away from this
dude.

966
00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:34,910
Kind of looks like me.
That's a little disturbing.

967
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:39,050
Like I'm gonna get Outta here.
Bald headed dude with a beard.

968
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:42,740
Trying to get away from this lion fish 
with wings thing.

969
00:42:42,830 --> 00:42:43,790
That's.
But that's what they thought.

970
00:42:43,791 --> 00:42:45,710
A whale was.
Craziness.

971
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:47,473
How?
Just imagine what it was like living a 

972
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:53,960
thousand years ago when there was no 
pictures.

973
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:55,400
That's the glass floor.
Yeah,

974
00:42:55,401 --> 00:42:57,860
that's my feet right there.
So you're in this church,

975
00:42:57,861 --> 00:42:59,210
the church.
A thousand years old.

976
00:42:59,211 --> 00:43:01,340
And that goes back to that last one,
Jeremy,

977
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:04,340
that one that's,
that's the glass floor.

978
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,233
And then you look down and they have 
this entirely different church 

979
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:13,340
underneath it that's way older.
They don't know how old it is.

980
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:16,460
Been there forever.
It could be several thousand years old.

981
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:19,220
The church is gorgeous though.
There's a lot of those churches.

982
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:20,990
And have you been to the Vatican?
Right?

983
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:23,340
Yeah,
that's the mind fuck of all mine phones.

984
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,233
It's crazy.
Like St Peter's Basilica when you're 

985
00:43:25,941 --> 00:43:27,500
walking around that place and you just 
like,

986
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:29,930
what?
How,

987
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:32,090
how did people do this?
It's retarded,

988
00:43:32,091 --> 00:43:34,100
man.
It's unbelievable.

989
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:37,130
Vatican's no power saws.
Nothing.

990
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:39,320
No,
no fucking cranes.

991
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:44,090
Everything was like ladders and shit.
The paintings and art.

992
00:43:44,210 --> 00:43:46,700
Just stunning,
stunning.

993
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:50,210
Billions of dollars with the art and the
whole area.

994
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:52,340
The whole Vatican is essentially its own
country.

995
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:53,193
Yeah.
So they can keep those kid fuckers over 

996
00:43:54,531 --> 00:43:56,330
there and they never have to export 
them.

997
00:43:57,050 --> 00:43:58,380
You know?
That's.

998
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,880
Yeah.
Yeah.

999
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,410
That's the darkest.
No,

1000
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:07,250
nobody can man dig.
They'll try.

1001
00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:09,680
People get mad and look,
I get it.

1002
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:13,160
I was a Catholic for a little bit.
That's a dark,

1003
00:44:13,161 --> 00:44:15,430
dark institution.
There is no denying it.

1004
00:44:15,431 --> 00:44:16,264
I mean they just,
they just busted another group of 

1005
00:44:17,511 --> 00:44:19,580
priests in,
in Pennsylvania,

1006
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:23,450
molested more than a thousand kids.
Moving them around,

1007
00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:28,230
charging them organized religion in 
general is the biggest mind controlled.

1008
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,580
It's over existed,
you know,

1009
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:32,760
trying to control popular populations

1010
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:36,270
and what's the best way and make you 
believe a certain thing.

1011
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:37,730
You know what I mean?
But there's,

1012
00:44:37,790 --> 00:44:40,800
there's better ones.
There's some that you go,

1013
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:41,580
oh,
for sure.

1014
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:43,620
For sure.
What are the baptists have done?

1015
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,000
What have they done?
It's so terrible.

1016
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:46,550
Oh,
it,

1017
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:49,980
no baptist scandals like that large 
scale scandals.

1018
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:51,563
Even the Mormons,
like they've had a few like dudes who 

1019
00:44:53,321 --> 00:44:55,760
want a more than one bride that got 
greedy and more than a few.

1020
00:44:56,290 --> 00:45:00,840
There's a whole part of their thing that
that's how they still live,

1021
00:45:00,841 --> 00:45:01,674
but there's some sex sec,
sec tease that a branched off and got 

1022
00:45:07,921 --> 00:45:08,754
real,
real freaky on the scale that the 

1023
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,270
Catholic Church has done things.
It's unprecedented.

1024
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:14,850
Unprecedented.
Completely.

1025
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:15,771
Yeah.
Because they,

1026
00:45:15,771 --> 00:45:20,550
they actively shield these people from 
prosecution and they kept it all.

1027
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:23,160
I mean,
are people actually getting like,

1028
00:45:23,310 --> 00:45:26,490
like I've heard some things like they're
going after like cardinals and shit,

1029
00:45:26,491 --> 00:45:27,490
like the criminals.

1030
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,810
That is the step down.
Yeah.

1031
00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:30,743
That last pope had to step down because 
they wanted to prosecute him for crimes 

1032
00:45:32,791 --> 00:45:33,624
against humanity because he was one of 
the dudes who orchestrated a lot of 

1033
00:45:36,001 --> 00:45:36,900
that.
Exactly.

1034
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:42,040
The Guy Right before then he moved a guy
who went on to molest 100 deaf children.

1035
00:45:43,470 --> 00:45:45,420
Yeah.
I remember reading stuff about that.

1036
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:47,570
It's dark,
it's dark,

1037
00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:49,560
and it's one of those things where 
people,

1038
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,740
you know,
it's been a part of their family.

1039
00:45:52,741 --> 00:45:54,340
It's been a part of their families 
family.

1040
00:45:54,341 --> 00:45:56,370
It's been a part of their history.
They go to church,

1041
00:45:56,371 --> 00:45:59,040
they pay their respects.
Everything's okay.

1042
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:00,870
They don't want to hear it.
People don't want to hear it,

1043
00:46:00,871 --> 00:46:01,704
but it's over.
The old evidence is just so 

1044
00:46:03,451 --> 00:46:05,580
overwhelming.
There's so much,

1045
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:08,590
so much shit that's attached to the 
point I.

1046
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:11,700
I didn't know.
I just think again,

1047
00:46:11,701 --> 00:46:13,530
people like you're saying you get.

1048
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,690
I was raised Catholic.
I just.

1049
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:18,960
By the time I was like,
I did this thing called confirmation,

1050
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:22,760
which is sort of like this,
a similar thing to what this,

1051
00:46:22,850 --> 00:46:23,683
the time that you're becoming a man,
you're making good choices as an adult 

1052
00:46:25,981 --> 00:46:28,020
because it wasn't just men,
but um,

1053
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:30,190
by the time I did that and realized 
like,

1054
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:31,770
okay,
okay,

1055
00:46:31,771 --> 00:46:33,250
this is,
there's not a lot or you know,

1056
00:46:33,370 --> 00:46:35,910
there's low too much magic going on for 
me.

1057
00:46:35,970 --> 00:46:37,710
You know what I mean?
Like going on with this.

1058
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:42,360
Like I like just factual,
knowledgeable things,

1059
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:44,850
you know,
like if these people really existed,

1060
00:46:44,851 --> 00:46:46,200
you know,
and were they really like,

1061
00:46:46,201 --> 00:46:47,034
I'm not buying into the fact that 
anybody on this earth didn't take a 

1062
00:46:50,701 --> 00:46:51,900
shit.
Like I took a shit.

1063
00:46:51,901 --> 00:46:53,790
You know what I mean?
We all take the same shifts.

1064
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:56,760
It'd be nice if someone came up with a 
good religion,

1065
00:46:56,930 --> 00:46:59,520
a real solid locked down one.

1066
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:00,870
I mean there's,
there is one.

1067
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,920
We,
we'd all just would have to agree on it.

1068
00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:04,463
How about just the golden rule that you 
don't mean that could basically be a 

1069
00:47:07,891 --> 00:47:10,470
religion and it's of the Church of 
universal law,

1070
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:12,840
you know,
do unto others as you would have them do

1071
00:47:12,841 --> 00:47:15,560
unto you and you could hold corporations
to that.

1072
00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:16,381
You could be like,
all right,

1073
00:47:16,381 --> 00:47:17,214
we stuck what's,
what's more powerful than 10 million 

1074
00:47:19,081 --> 00:47:19,914
people on a facebook page that are 
watching these corporations and the 

1075
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:24,481
minute they say,
hey,

1076
00:47:24,481 --> 00:47:25,314
you're not giving back to the community,
are taken care of the people that are 

1077
00:47:27,091 --> 00:47:28,920
taking care of you,
that's easily.

1078
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:30,340
But it takes work.

1079
00:47:30,490 --> 00:47:32,170
It's a good point.
It's easily done.

1080
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:36,070
If everybody in the world just really 
treated the next person like they wanted

1081
00:47:36,071 --> 00:47:39,610
to be treated themselves,
there you go.

1082
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,330
And did it as a law.
Right?

1083
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:42,190
And then we,
we,

1084
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:45,070
we held people accountable to that.
Yeah.

1085
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:47,140
You are not responding to the universal 
law,

1086
00:47:47,470 --> 00:47:49,500
universal golden golden rule.
You know,

1087
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:51,760
it sounds super simple,
but I mean to get a lot of work,

1088
00:47:51,761 --> 00:47:54,760
but it's the principle is simple,
right?

1089
00:47:54,761 --> 00:47:55,594
And all the other stuff,
like all other forms of commerce and 

1090
00:47:57,671 --> 00:47:59,860
everything else would still fall under 
that.

1091
00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:00,963
Just like you could do whatever you want
as long as you're treating people 

1092
00:48:02,711 --> 00:48:03,760
kindly.
Exactly.

1093
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:08,020
Like ideally commerce and capitalism,
all that stuff should be real simple.

1094
00:48:08,021 --> 00:48:11,680
Like you have a great cd,
you want to sell it,

1095
00:48:11,681 --> 00:48:14,260
you want 20 bucks for it.
Somebody gives you 20 bucks,

1096
00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:16,180
they're happy,
you're happy.

1097
00:48:16,450 --> 00:48:18,070
That should be commerce,
right?

1098
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:19,060
Yeah.
It should be.

1099
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:21,250
You sell something,
people buy it,

1100
00:48:21,251 --> 00:48:24,040
everybody's good,
but then you get a little greedy,

1101
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:24,913
you know,
if we can figure out a way to corner 

1102
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:27,273
this market and keep other people from 
selling this or selling that or we've 

1103
00:48:31,121 --> 00:48:34,740
got to stop people from growing this 
because if they grow this and sell that,

1104
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:35,613
you're not doing what's best for doing 
what you would want them to do for to 

1105
00:48:38,651 --> 00:48:39,750
you.
Exactly.

1106
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:42,550
So you're breaking the law violation.
The golden rule.

1107
00:48:42,590 --> 00:48:43,423
If,
if that's what I've thought about it 

1108
00:48:45,431 --> 00:48:46,450
obviously before,
like,

1109
00:48:46,451 --> 00:48:48,370
hey man,
what would be like,

1110
00:48:48,371 --> 00:48:50,110
yeah,
that'd be a really cool thing to do.

1111
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:50,973
You know?
That would be the way you know somebody 

1112
00:48:52,601 --> 00:48:53,900
with enough charisma,
you know,

1113
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:55,090
could pull it off,
you know,

1114
00:48:55,270 --> 00:48:56,103
get people to get behind it.
That's really all it would say because 

1115
00:48:58,070 --> 00:48:59,170
people getting behind it.

1116
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:00,333
Yeah,
but the problem is there's so many 

1117
00:49:01,001 --> 00:49:04,450
people that just.
We're seeing this with politics,

1118
00:49:04,451 --> 00:49:05,320
right?
Like I'm,

1119
00:49:05,330 --> 00:49:07,540
I'm fascinated by these cabinet 
hearings,

1120
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:11,470
like a watch little clips of it before I
just have to tune out and talk fuckery.

1121
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:14,560
Talk about fuckery.
I mean,

1122
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:17,050
I don't know what that do did or what he
didn't do,

1123
00:49:17,051 --> 00:49:19,090
but I think what's happening is more 
than that,

1124
00:49:19,510 --> 00:49:24,510
what's happening is first of all he's 
involved with a.

1125
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:27,670
He was a big part of the Patriot Act.
He was,

1126
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:29,530
you know,
he's involved in some,

1127
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:33,550
some issues that a lot of people are 
very concerned with in terms of like how

1128
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:37,800
his position,
his stance on privacy and on rights and.

1129
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:38,750
Absolutely.
Yeah.

1130
00:49:39,090 --> 00:49:43,060
There's more to it than just did you 
fuck with someone in high school?

1131
00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:46,140
Did you sexually assault someone?
Did you do that when you're 18 digit,

1132
00:49:46,170 --> 00:49:46,710
do you remember?

1133
00:49:46,710 --> 00:49:47,543
Like there's more to it than that.
There's just like they don't want that 

1134
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:51,424
guy in there and then you're seeing all 
the people that want to pretend that 

1135
00:49:54,131 --> 00:49:56,290
he's the best guy ever.
And all the people.

1136
00:49:57,130 --> 00:49:59,410
It's crazy.
It's fascinating.

1137
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:00,753
It's really fascinating.
It's fascinating to watch because it's 

1138
00:50:02,231 --> 00:50:07,231
essentially like a less like the 
Clarence Thomas hearings from.

1139
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:12,130
Was it like the 19 eighties?
I believe Clarence Thomas.

1140
00:50:12,131 --> 00:50:13,990
I feel like that was late eighties.
Early nineties.

1141
00:50:14,230 --> 00:50:15,520
Yeah,
somewhere around there.

1142
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:16,533
Clarence Thomas.
That was with Anita Hill where he had 

1143
00:50:19,571 --> 00:50:23,950
sexually harassed or they were working 
together and she came whatever,

1144
00:50:23,951 --> 00:50:24,784
coke or something.
Do you know that he's now the longest 

1145
00:50:26,591 --> 00:50:28,520
running a member of the Supreme Court.

1146
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:31,653
He's.
He's now been in the supreme court 

1147
00:50:33,010 --> 00:50:33,970
longer,
I think.

1148
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:36,400
Read that check.
Make sure that's true.

1149
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:39,490
Isn't Bruce Katie?
Ken's Bader Ginsburg.

1150
00:50:39,491 --> 00:50:44,260
Has she been there longest serving 26 
years as of October fourth mob?

1151
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:45,940
Yeah.
Crazy.

1152
00:50:46,090 --> 00:50:47,650
Crazy.
Yeah.

1153
00:50:47,651 --> 00:50:48,484
So it didn't work.
Needed hell's out there then with the 

1154
00:50:51,521 --> 00:50:52,354
memory of pubic hairs on Coke and a 
movie now and Hbo Movie Not Too Long 

1155
00:50:56,651 --> 00:50:58,030
Ago.
Oh yeah.

1156
00:50:58,180 --> 00:50:59,440
Did you watch it?
I saw it.

1157
00:50:59,450 --> 00:50:59,950
It was,
it was.

1158
00:50:59,950 --> 00:51:01,240
Was it okay.
It was a pretty good movie.

1159
00:51:01,241 --> 00:51:02,320
It was just,
you know,

1160
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:03,790
we lived through it.
So it's like,

1161
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:07,130
it's like whenever I see movies about 
like the Oj trial or something,

1162
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:07,540
I'm like,
no,

1163
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:11,110
I saw that.
We saw it live for like 700 days.

1164
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:15,100
I'm always fascinated by those movies 
because of creative license.

1165
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:17,590
Like if you do a movie on Richard Nixon,
right?

1166
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:20,170
What do you sure he said that?
Or even crazier.

1167
00:51:20,171 --> 00:51:22,690
You do a movie on Lincoln Bitch.
You don't know what the fuck.

1168
00:51:22,691 --> 00:51:25,880
He said you can't be like Sibley unless 
he wrote it down.

1169
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:30,010
You're having him say a bunch of Shit 
Day to day talking to his wife and kids.

1170
00:51:30,011 --> 00:51:33,100
You don't know what the fuck he says.
He just making this up.

1171
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:34,870
This is weird that we're allowed to do 
that.

1172
00:51:34,871 --> 00:51:37,610
You're allowed to just put some words in
George Washington's mouth like

1173
00:51:38,450 --> 00:51:40,250
you don't know what the fuck George 
Washington said.

1174
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:41,813
You know,
have you seen this movie coming out 

1175
00:51:43,161 --> 00:51:45,380
there?
Christian Bale is Dick Cheney and dude,

1176
00:51:45,381 --> 00:51:46,960
it looks amazing.
Steve Carell's,

1177
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:47,803
Donald Rumsfeld,
Christian Bale is a fucking bad 

1178
00:51:50,790 --> 00:51:51,623
motherfucker.
His acting as Dick Cheney is off the 

1179
00:51:54,261 --> 00:51:56,330
charts.
I mean he does the voice.

1180
00:51:56,331 --> 00:51:58,670
He got fat for it.
Everything.

1181
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:00,830
That's him.
Whoa,

1182
00:52:01,010 --> 00:52:04,220
dude.
Here's the video of.

1183
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:08,420
First of all,
him and I'm Sam Rockwell is George Bush.

1184
00:52:08,450 --> 00:52:09,283
He's amazing to Sam.
Rockwell is one of the most 

1185
00:52:12,711 --> 00:52:17,570
underappreciated vice price.
It's amazing,

1186
00:52:17,571 --> 00:52:20,910
dude.
Sam Rockwell nails it as joy here played

1187
00:52:20,911 --> 00:52:23,160
the trailer where they pull us.
It's too new yet.

1188
00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:26,180
Oh son of a bitch.
You turn it up.

1189
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:27,333
A large company.
If you folks who are listening to this 

1190
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:32,090
on youtube,
we can't play this for you,

1191
00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:33,463
but I mean that's weird.
They wouldn't want you to like play 

1192
00:52:39,111 --> 00:52:39,944
their trailer.
They want everybody to go to their 

1193
00:52:41,331 --> 00:52:42,170
trailer.
True.

1194
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:43,190
Oh yeah.
It's strange.

1195
00:52:43,191 --> 00:52:44,540
I should make that.
Yeah,

1196
00:52:45,050 --> 00:52:50,050
you're right.
It's just so good.

1197
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:55,360
He just does an amazing job of the 
voice,

1198
00:52:55,361 --> 00:52:58,620
the mannerisms and so to Sam Rockwell.
Well,

1199
00:52:58,890 --> 00:53:00,700
they're both incredible actors.
Samara,

1200
00:53:00,770 --> 00:53:02,350
mercy.
Sam Rockwell in that movie,

1201
00:53:02,351 --> 00:53:06,790
Moon the Moon or moon moon.
I'm not sure.

1202
00:53:07,030 --> 00:53:10,750
It's a movie where he is the only person
in the movie.

1203
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:14,500
The entire movies.
I don't want to spoiler alert it,

1204
00:53:14,501 --> 00:53:19,501
but it has to do with cloning and it's 
him on the moon like him,

1205
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:24,190
him or him in space.
It's fucking amazing.

1206
00:53:24,310 --> 00:53:25,870
It's an amazing.
I love

1207
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:28,310
Chuck Barris.
Yes.

1208
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:30,250
That was an amazing movie,
man.

1209
00:53:30,270 --> 00:53:32,290
He's a beast.
This guy is a

1210
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:35,930
fucking incredible actor and he just 
doesn't get enough credit.

1211
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:37,153
I met.
He's,

1212
00:53:37,250 --> 00:53:39,350
I think he might be married to her now,
but he was,

1213
00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:43,550
or maybe they're still dating,
but he was dating Leslie Bibb when,

1214
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:44,384
uh,
I did a movie with her and I got a 

1215
00:53:47,571 --> 00:53:49,900
chance to meet him and I was a little 
bit starstruck.

1216
00:53:50,150 --> 00:53:54,200
I'm a big giant fan of that guy,
but he's one of those guys I feel like I

1217
00:53:54,201 --> 00:53:55,070
want to say like,
dude,

1218
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:56,360
you're fucking amazing.
Like,

1219
00:53:56,361 --> 00:53:57,194
I don't know if anybody's telling you 
because you're fucking amazing because 

1220
00:53:59,631 --> 00:54:00,351
it's like,
you know,

1221
00:54:00,351 --> 00:54:03,290
you hear about the great actors.
You hear Daniel Day Lewis,

1222
00:54:03,291 --> 00:54:05,930
you hear Gary old men,
you know,

1223
00:54:05,931 --> 00:54:08,240
you hear Christian Bale,
you hear the,

1224
00:54:08,290 --> 00:54:11,360
the great actors,
Faye Dunaway,

1225
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:14,270
sigourney weaver.
You don't hear about Sam Rockwell.

1226
00:54:15,110 --> 00:54:17,570
Why Not Jamie?
Why not?

1227
00:54:17,571 --> 00:54:19,580
God Damn it.
Maybe you will.

1228
00:54:19,581 --> 00:54:20,414
After this movie,
maybe he looks like he's never been 

1229
00:54:22,221 --> 00:54:27,221
nominated for anything.
Probably was probably was from moon,

1230
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:31,670
was nominated a few things.
That one that just came out last year.

1231
00:54:31,671 --> 00:54:32,600
The three billboards.

1232
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:34,370
Oh yeah,
that's what I was thinking.

1233
00:54:34,390 --> 00:54:36,800
I just remember hearing about him.
He was getting,

1234
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:38,870
you know,
he's just one of them dudes too.

1235
00:54:38,871 --> 00:54:42,320
Like when you're that good of an actor,
you blend into these movies.

1236
00:54:42,321 --> 00:54:42,970
So good.
It's,

1237
00:54:42,970 --> 00:54:45,050
it's not,
it's not Sam Rockwell.

1238
00:54:45,230 --> 00:54:46,063
You know what I mean?
Like that's almost a compliment to the 

1239
00:54:47,931 --> 00:54:51,290
dude.
Now should he be more of the leading guy

1240
00:54:51,291 --> 00:54:52,530
and doing those big rolls.
Yeah,

1241
00:54:52,531 --> 00:54:53,660
I agree.
It's an amazing actor.

1242
00:54:53,661 --> 00:54:55,800
But he's gotten,
he's done some really big things,

1243
00:54:55,810 --> 00:54:56,643
man.
It's just,

1244
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:58,400
he's one of them dudes.
It just blends too.

1245
00:54:58,401 --> 00:54:59,840
Good.
You know who's another one like that?

1246
00:54:59,841 --> 00:55:01,420
Vigo Mortenson.
Yes.

1247
00:55:02,270 --> 00:55:05,420
Everything is in you just lose it.
And he's in it like he's that guy.

1248
00:55:06,070 --> 00:55:06,970
Yeah.
Yeah.

1249
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:07,590
Uh,
the,

1250
00:55:07,590 --> 00:55:10,250
the one where he was the far eastern 
promises.

1251
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:12,850
Yeah.
Was the Russian mob movie in here?

1252
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:14,330
Yes.
And then what?

1253
00:55:14,330 --> 00:55:16,760
The Year of violence that he did.
That was a good one too.

1254
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:19,460
It was a good one.
The road freaked me out.

1255
00:55:19,461 --> 00:55:22,220
I turned it off when you're teaching his
son how to shoot himself in the mouth.

1256
00:55:22,221 --> 00:55:23,060
I was like,
done.

1257
00:55:23,210 --> 00:55:24,980
We're good.
I need to watch this.

1258
00:55:25,430 --> 00:55:27,470
Watch the flintstones.
Fucking crazy.

1259
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:28,490
So what I heard.
Yeah,

1260
00:55:28,610 --> 00:55:30,680
I've heard the books too.
Crazy dark man.

1261
00:55:30,681 --> 00:55:34,080
Like that's one of the things like a 
sake said,

1262
00:55:34,090 --> 00:55:36,020
taste.
That stays with you a little too long.

1263
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:36,893
I want it to go away.
There's a few of those movies that are 

1264
00:55:39,231 --> 00:55:40,910
just so depressing.
When you leave,

1265
00:55:40,911 --> 00:55:42,110
you're like,
what did I do?

1266
00:55:42,350 --> 00:55:45,860
Like I don't want to be depressed.
I know that it was good.

1267
00:55:46,070 --> 00:55:47,690
I know you nailed it.
I know you.

1268
00:55:47,691 --> 00:55:51,140
You dragged my mom once on tour.
I fucking.

1269
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:52,880
It was like back when you got when 
everyone.

1270
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:53,813
When the tower records and those things 
were still around like on Tuesdays the 

1271
00:55:56,001 --> 00:55:57,710
movies and the records would all come 
out.

1272
00:55:58,010 --> 00:56:01,350
So we on tour we would stop and buy a 
bunch of shit for the bus by records and

1273
00:56:01,850 --> 00:56:05,540
I bought a bunch of movies and I threw 
on Magnolia had just come out.

1274
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:07,820
I watched that and I was like,
oh wow.

1275
00:56:07,821 --> 00:56:08,654
That was fucking fucked up and then 
without looking I just grabbed the next 

1276
00:56:12,621 --> 00:56:13,454
movie and put it in and it was titus 
andronicus and I don't know if you're 

1277
00:56:15,761 --> 00:56:16,594
aware of like hip to this,
like one of the darkest fucking 

1278
00:56:18,411 --> 00:56:21,940
Shakespeare fucking place ever about 
this dummy goes.

1279
00:56:22,190 --> 00:56:24,100
If you ain't seen it when you got

1280
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:27,070
the wherewithal to sit through some real
fucking darkness.

1281
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:31,300
Anthony Hopkins is fucking insane.
In this movie is Titus Andronicus.

1282
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:32,433
It's fucking dark.
So I watched these two movies back to 

1283
00:56:35,321 --> 00:56:40,321
back and for two weeks joe,
I can't shake the like just seeing like,

1284
00:56:41,890 --> 00:56:44,680
oh my God,
there's no happy endings anywhere.

1285
00:56:44,681 --> 00:56:47,170
The world's.
From then on,

1286
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:52,470
I'll only watch comedies and fucking 
like pixar movies and old warner brother

1287
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:55,870
art students out there on the road.
Man.

1288
00:56:55,871 --> 00:56:57,620
Damn.
Why people are hanging in front of them.

1289
00:56:58,010 --> 00:56:58,810
I do.
I do.

1290
00:56:58,810 --> 00:57:00,190
You want to know?
You're never going to watch this.

1291
00:57:00,191 --> 00:57:01,024
Right?
He's about to cut them up and make 

1292
00:57:02,381 --> 00:57:05,320
dinner out of them and serve them and to
their families.

1293
00:57:05,350 --> 00:57:06,910
Like it's dark.

1294
00:57:08,950 --> 00:57:10,600
It's really dark.
It's one of the darker.

1295
00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:14,290
It is the darkest Shakespeare like thing
I've ever read or seen.

1296
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:17,550
Okay.
That's enough.

1297
00:57:17,590 --> 00:57:21,540
And that was right after Magnolia.
I A double whammy.

1298
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:23,170
Fresh dude.
Oh,

1299
00:57:23,171 --> 00:57:24,910
it was horrible.
I remember that movie.

1300
00:57:24,911 --> 00:57:26,440
Twenty one grams.
Yeah.

1301
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:28,750
That movie's swore me off.
A depressing movies.

1302
00:57:29,110 --> 00:57:30,910
After that movie was over,
I left the theater.

1303
00:57:30,911 --> 00:57:32,350
I'm like,
why did I do that to myself?

1304
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:34,410
I was in such a good mood.
Who wants to.

1305
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:36,790
Who wants to leave a place with that 
feeling?

1306
00:57:36,791 --> 00:57:37,231
Don't,
doesn't,

1307
00:57:37,231 --> 00:57:40,000
doesn't life give you that enough?
I was all happy.

1308
00:57:40,630 --> 00:57:42,130
I was all happy,
feeling good.

1309
00:57:42,350 --> 00:57:44,650
Uh,
walked into that movie and I left going,

1310
00:57:44,651 --> 00:57:47,410
what in the actual fuck,
what am I doing here?

1311
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:53,040
As Dj Kelly would say,
played yourself and other people said it

1312
00:57:54,281 --> 00:57:56,140
beforehand,
but he's like known for it.

1313
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:58,120
It's funny how that happens,
right?

1314
00:57:58,530 --> 00:57:59,363
I do just says something just right.
And then everybody just connects it to 

1315
00:58:03,401 --> 00:58:04,570
him.
He had a string of them.

1316
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:07,090
He had a bunch of his little in meeting.
Uh,

1317
00:58:07,110 --> 00:58:09,760
you know,
he's got the new deal alerts.

1318
00:58:09,761 --> 00:58:10,594
These agencies is a bastion of these 
little sayings that people catch onto 

1319
00:58:16,270 --> 00:58:17,103
it.
He's got a lot of good things going for 

1320
00:58:17,951 --> 00:58:18,784
him.
He's unthreatening looking because he's 

1321
00:58:19,691 --> 00:58:22,210
kind of a big Chubby guy.
People like him because of that,

1322
00:58:22,710 --> 00:58:24,130
you know,
there's a lot of good things going.

1323
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:29,700
Obviously Energy,
energy likes shiny flashy shit.

1324
00:58:31,150 --> 00:58:32,800
People like.
Yeah.

1325
00:58:33,310 --> 00:58:34,540
And he couldn't afford it.
Yeah.

1326
00:58:34,770 --> 00:58:38,590
It's nice.
Hashtag ball and kind of do it.

1327
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:39,580
Yeah,
I guess so.

1328
00:58:39,770 --> 00:58:41,080
Yeah.
Part of that lifestyle,

1329
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:44,920
that's a crazy lifestyle.
Kanye is a part of that lifestyle too.

1330
00:58:44,921 --> 00:58:46,180
Right?
But in a weird way,

1331
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:49,210
he's a weird part of that lifestyle.
It's never been a jewel.

1332
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:51,340
That jewelry you seen anything new?
Not really big.

1333
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:55,090
I mean like,
but he's big on design and Ferrari's and

1334
00:58:55,091 --> 00:58:57,970
Lamborghini's and beautiful houses and 
showing that.

1335
00:58:58,130 --> 00:59:00,490
Aware of like winning a note.
Yeah.

1336
00:59:00,491 --> 00:59:01,110
Design.
Yeah.

1337
00:59:01,110 --> 00:59:04,750
No,
I know just from what I know of him that

1338
00:59:04,751 --> 00:59:09,010
he longs to be Ralph Lauren.
That's really his,

1339
00:59:09,070 --> 00:59:11,380
you know,
probably like you said,

1340
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:14,220
who is your biggest influence or who 
would you want to be?

1341
00:59:14,410 --> 00:59:15,490
Ralph Lauren.
Yeah.

1342
00:59:15,491 --> 00:59:18,820
That's kind of hilarious.
But he just loves design,

1343
00:59:18,821 --> 00:59:20,110
right.
Loves clothes,

1344
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:21,753
I guess.

1345
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:24,220
Yeah.
I mean why not somebodies gotta?

1346
00:59:24,550 --> 00:59:27,020
I mean,
he knows all that stuff he was doing was

1347
00:59:27,021 --> 00:59:28,990
looking like homeless people's clothing 
into.

1348
00:59:29,030 --> 00:59:32,600
It's like daryl leaked,
right of fucking suitland or did you see

1349
00:59:32,601 --> 00:59:34,790
that one video picture that Jamie showed
me?

1350
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,430
He was walking around with slides.
Easy slides on,

1351
00:59:37,431 --> 00:59:39,260
but there were like four sizes too 
small.

1352
00:59:39,620 --> 00:59:40,453
I didn't make any sense.
It's like heels hanging off the back of 

1353
00:59:42,831 --> 00:59:44,620
him.
Like the way he designed them.

1354
00:59:44,630 --> 00:59:46,850
Exactly.
That's like he's probably trying to push

1355
00:59:46,860 --> 00:59:47,693
a new thing here.
Tiny yeezy slides too small for your 

1356
00:59:50,691 --> 00:59:53,060
feet to small yeezy slides.
There you go.

1357
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:54,680
Yeah.
That's the new look.

1358
00:59:55,340 --> 01:00:00,020
Like if you're crazy,
you might think it's crazy to me because

1359
01:00:00,110 --> 01:00:02,570
there's an era of his career that I look
at it and I'm like,

1360
01:00:02,571 --> 01:00:04,250
well man,
there's a lot of genius shit.

1361
01:00:04,251 --> 01:00:05,084
He was doing musically a lot of records 
he was doing and then I don't know what 

1362
01:00:08,991 --> 01:00:09,920
it is,
but to me,

1363
01:00:10,170 --> 01:00:11,003
to me now,
and I don't say this in a judgmental 

1364
01:00:14,361 --> 01:00:16,670
way,
but he's a professional troll now.

1365
01:00:16,970 --> 01:00:19,120
Just like that's the most successful 
people in the.

1366
01:00:19,130 --> 01:00:20,840
In the entertainment business.
Now,

1367
01:00:21,170 --> 01:00:23,930
if you're not an amazing actor or a 
super amazing,

1368
01:00:23,931 --> 01:00:24,764
you know,
whatever is like just keeping people 

1369
01:00:26,871 --> 01:00:29,870
trolling everybody.
He literally dropped a song like at some

1370
01:00:29,871 --> 01:00:30,704
point,
like eight months ago where that was 

1371
01:00:31,221 --> 01:00:32,920
like poop scoop,
scoop it,

1372
01:00:32,921 --> 01:00:34,270
Ipu de Boop,
boop,

1373
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:35,050
boop,
boop.

1374
01:00:35,050 --> 01:00:36,860
You know that sort.
And that was the song.

1375
01:00:36,861 --> 01:00:39,710
It lasted that long.
Jamie came and played for me or you told

1376
01:00:39,711 --> 01:00:41,570
me the lyrics.
I can't shut the fuck up.

1377
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:42,990
No,
but it's like,

1378
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:45,450
it's again,
it's the spectacle.

1379
01:00:45,550 --> 01:00:46,383
Jamie,
you stopped putting this evil in my 

1380
01:00:47,511 --> 01:00:48,860
head.
It's the spectacle.

1381
01:00:48,861 --> 01:00:50,690
Like,
I mean I made this album here.

1382
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:52,150
That's music.
You know what I mean?

1383
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:52,993
This is music.
A lot of people don't give a fuck 

1384
01:00:54,261 --> 01:00:54,861
anymore.
Well,

1385
01:00:54,861 --> 01:00:56,930
you're not that guy.
You've never been a,

1386
01:00:56,931 --> 01:00:58,130
I need publicity guy.

1387
01:00:58,250 --> 01:01:00,710
Well here's what it is and here's what 
that is.

1388
01:01:00,711 --> 01:01:04,670
It's like people like to fucking 
speculate about what I do or my career.

1389
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:05,533
You know what I mean?
I've written a few songs in this life 

1390
01:01:08,181 --> 01:01:09,014
that I could go somewhere and sit down 
and just sit on a fucking stump and eat 

1391
01:01:12,201 --> 01:01:14,120
food for the rest of my life.
I never worry,

1392
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:15,433
you know what I mean?
I could feed my family and all that off 

1393
01:01:16,431 --> 01:01:17,264
of a few songs.
I make music because I love making 

1394
01:01:18,861 --> 01:01:19,700
music,
you know?

1395
01:01:19,790 --> 01:01:20,623
And of course you want people to listen.
You want to fucking the more people you 

1396
01:01:23,541 --> 01:01:24,374
know,
you want people you want fame or all 

1397
01:01:26,170 --> 01:01:27,020
that.
But I don't,

1398
01:01:27,470 --> 01:01:28,060
I'm not,
I'm not.

1399
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:28,893
Again,
one of the first things is the first 

1400
01:01:29,961 --> 01:01:31,810
time I ever came on your podcast was 
like,

1401
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:32,713
I like going to Ralph's and sitting at 
the olive bar and fucking getting my 

1402
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:37,913
olives while my songs playing on the 
radio and the guys standing right next 

1403
01:01:41,031 --> 01:01:41,210
to me.

1404
01:01:41,210 --> 01:01:43,460
I had no fucking idea.
I don't mind that at all.

1405
01:01:43,461 --> 01:01:44,294
That doesn't bother me.
I love you're not a need attention kind 

1406
01:01:47,151 --> 01:01:50,540
of a guy and some people are and that's 
sort of part of their business.

1407
01:01:50,810 --> 01:01:53,630
Like this whole Kanye Donald trump 
thing.

1408
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:56,750
I just,
I wonder if that's trolling,

1409
01:01:56,990 --> 01:01:57,823
but I also wonder if what we were 
talking about earlier about car 

1410
01:01:59,841 --> 01:02:00,674
accidents and brain damage.
I wonder if that's a little bit of 

1411
01:02:02,690 --> 01:02:04,070
everything,
but also the reason I,

1412
01:02:04,071 --> 01:02:04,904
I,
I say it's trolling is because there's 

1413
01:02:09,290 --> 01:02:13,220
likes and stuff.
When you get to car Dash Ian,

1414
01:02:13,220 --> 01:02:16,940
Kanye West levels of,
and I'm sure you know this just you have

1415
01:02:16,941 --> 01:02:20,040
for fucking million instagram followers.
I didn't start

1416
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:21,900
instagram until you told me to.
I know that,

1417
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:23,033
but what I'm saying is like,
you could monetize that shit really 

1418
01:02:27,421 --> 01:02:29,070
easily.
Those 4 million people.

1419
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:30,990
You're not that.
You're not selling that shit out.

1420
01:02:31,170 --> 01:02:33,960
These people,
they are definitely monetizing that shit

1421
01:02:33,961 --> 01:02:35,670
fucking.
When Kim Kardashian gets on there,

1422
01:02:35,850 --> 01:02:38,070
she doesn't give you a commercial,
but she'll tell you,

1423
01:02:38,071 --> 01:02:39,870
I'm just using this new cream on my 
shit.

1424
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:40,733
You know what I mean?
Here it,

1425
01:02:41,060 --> 01:02:43,740
somebody paid her 100 fucking 50 grand 
for that post.

1426
01:02:43,741 --> 01:02:44,850
You know?
It's like,

1427
01:02:45,150 --> 01:02:47,640
that's,
that's so the more eyes,

1428
01:02:47,670 --> 01:02:49,950
the better.
That's really what they're monetizing as

1429
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:50,793
I can.
If I had 10 million people on my 

1430
01:02:52,411 --> 01:02:54,930
instagram,
I could sell fucking posts.

1431
01:02:55,050 --> 01:02:57,180
The real problem with that is people 
don't believe them,

1432
01:02:57,780 --> 01:02:58,613
you know,
like you,

1433
01:02:58,710 --> 01:03:01,710
but their eyes are still.
If I say I like something,

1434
01:03:01,830 --> 01:03:04,040
it's because I like it.
Like if,

1435
01:03:04,060 --> 01:03:04,893
if,
and this is people but cues me and have 

1436
01:03:06,181 --> 01:03:08,340
an ads,
I've never had a single ad.

1437
01:03:08,530 --> 01:03:09,363
I'm my instagram.
If I tell people about a product and 

1438
01:03:11,461 --> 01:03:12,300
people like,
what are you?

1439
01:03:12,301 --> 01:03:13,430
Do you getting paid for this?
Like,

1440
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:14,640
nope.
Nope,

1441
01:03:14,641 --> 01:03:15,474
nope.
I just like it.

1442
01:03:15,740 --> 01:03:16,650
Yeah.
Sharon,

1443
01:03:16,651 --> 01:03:19,770
something I thought you might think is 
cool done in a few times,

1444
01:03:19,771 --> 01:03:20,640
but I usually say,
hey,

1445
01:03:20,641 --> 01:03:22,680
I'm not getting fucking paid.
I'm just telling you.

1446
01:03:22,690 --> 01:03:24,720
Yeah,
I do now because it is not.

1447
01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:26,250
I like this.
You know what I mean?

1448
01:03:26,310 --> 01:03:30,620
Plus I ain't got enough instagram 
followers to get Jamie.

1449
01:03:31,950 --> 01:03:35,430
Jamie was saying you need $70,000.
That's the number.

1450
01:03:35,460 --> 01:03:36,390
First of all,
I don't.

1451
01:03:36,540 --> 01:03:37,410
I don't know.
I don't.

1452
01:03:37,820 --> 01:03:39,390
I know you don't give a fuck,
but if you did,

1453
01:03:39,391 --> 01:03:41,460
if you were a chick with a fake,
but you might be able to get a little.

1454
01:03:41,790 --> 01:03:43,800
I might have 4 million followers of.

1455
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:47,070
Yeah,
you might write,

1456
01:03:47,071 --> 01:03:48,750
you might have 20.
Look at this.

1457
01:03:48,751 --> 01:03:51,480
Kim Kardashian has got $118 million 
followers.

1458
01:03:51,481 --> 01:03:53,630
Just wow.
Good googly Mowgli.

1459
01:03:54,010 --> 01:03:54,661
Okay.
And let's say,

1460
01:03:54,661 --> 01:03:55,750
what did they say?
If you're,

1461
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:56,673
if you're actually good at social media,
maybe 10 percent of your audience 

1462
01:03:59,431 --> 01:04:00,264
engages you.
So that's still 10 million people that 

1463
01:04:03,751 --> 01:04:07,470
will engage with her.
A lot of fun.

1464
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:10,950
I believe I threw that number out there.
Just cut it sounds about right.

1465
01:04:11,010 --> 01:04:12,960
Yeah.
A lot of God damn people.

1466
01:04:13,340 --> 01:04:15,240
Woo.
Yeah.

1467
01:04:15,241 --> 01:04:17,370
It's a weird business.
Matt's famous now,

1468
01:04:17,371 --> 01:04:18,990
like when we were young,
famous was,

1469
01:04:19,830 --> 01:04:20,663
you know,
if you're on tv or the radio or you 

1470
01:04:24,271 --> 01:04:25,104
know,
movies,

1471
01:04:25,470 --> 01:04:28,320
if you did something in life,
I wrote a book,

1472
01:04:28,590 --> 01:04:30,600
wrote a play or a movie,
you know what I mean?

1473
01:04:30,610 --> 01:04:35,060
You invented the plane and that's what 
got you famous.

1474
01:04:35,130 --> 01:04:38,160
Now you just got to keep eyes on you 
doing fucked up shit.

1475
01:04:38,220 --> 01:04:41,840
I was thinking about that today while I 
was watching gladiator because uh,

1476
01:04:41,850 --> 01:04:43,750
what I was watching that movie,
I was thinking the,

1477
01:04:43,810 --> 01:04:47,670
in the Roman times there was no 
accountability like for emperors,

1478
01:04:47,730 --> 01:04:51,690
you could do all kinds of fucked up shit
and no one could do anything about it.

1479
01:04:51,930 --> 01:04:52,763
These are the killed you eventually or 
you got away with it for a long period 

1480
01:04:56,101 --> 01:04:58,110
of time.
But today,

1481
01:04:58,990 --> 01:05:01,590
you know,
like there's so much,

1482
01:05:02,070 --> 01:05:06,150
there's so much accountability.
People find out what awful things you've

1483
01:05:06,151 --> 01:05:09,540
done.
They find out you've stolen money or had

1484
01:05:09,541 --> 01:05:13,690
people killed or do you know,
took over this or dominated that.

1485
01:05:13,691 --> 01:05:18,691
Like this to be a like to be a dictator.
Look at Kim Jong Aoun like someone,

1486
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:24,490
some along those lines today.
You have to keep those people locked up.

1487
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:26,560
Like,
and he's barely keeping that together.

1488
01:05:26,570 --> 01:05:29,680
They barely have an amaze me how they 
can like,

1489
01:05:29,681 --> 01:05:30,514
you know,
like there's not a whole scene there of 

1490
01:05:31,411 --> 01:05:34,570
people with the Internet like sneaking 
it in and you know what they did?

1491
01:05:34,650 --> 01:05:35,381
They,
everybody,

1492
01:05:35,381 --> 01:05:39,280
rats and everybody else there.
They have like a whole system of ratting

1493
01:05:39,281 --> 01:05:40,114
on people.
They have a culture of rats and they 

1494
01:05:42,641 --> 01:05:45,430
believe their leaders of God or 
something of that nature.

1495
01:05:45,670 --> 01:05:47,080
They just don't want to die,
man.

1496
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:49,780
They're scared and they're hungry and 
they don't have any power.

1497
01:05:49,810 --> 01:05:50,643
They don't have any energy because 
they're eating just rice and fucking 

1498
01:05:52,571 --> 01:05:53,404
starving to death.
Even imagined when they catch those 

1499
01:05:54,761 --> 01:05:56,710
dudes that sneak across the border,
you know,

1500
01:05:56,711 --> 01:05:57,544
that make a run for it.
When they get them and bring them to 

1501
01:05:58,960 --> 01:05:59,793
hospitals and patch them up and shit,
they find all these crazy parasites in 

1502
01:06:02,951 --> 01:06:05,530
them.
Massive mountain nutrition and these are

1503
01:06:05,531 --> 01:06:09,580
soldiers like North Korean soldiers.
They're just all fucked up and this.

1504
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:10,713
But that's a window into time.
Like if you went back into the Roman 

1505
01:06:15,070 --> 01:06:15,520
days,
this,

1506
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:16,353
that's how everybody was rocking it.
They were all dominating their people 

1507
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:22,270
and use an iron fist and keep.

1508
01:06:22,740 --> 01:06:26,620
Keep these generals well fed and keep 
the army well fed and use it to dominate

1509
01:06:26,621 --> 01:06:29,000
the civilians.
And uhm,

1510
01:06:29,830 --> 01:06:31,210
I mean,
I know gladiators,

1511
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:35,740
just a movie and just fake and fun,
but still,

1512
01:06:35,741 --> 01:06:40,270
you gotta wonder like that.
How close was that to life back then?

1513
01:06:40,510 --> 01:06:43,470
And how bad did it smell?
Bad?

1514
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:47,080
I mean like tubes have on hbo called 
Rome,

1515
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:49,240
like where they had and they had this 
one scene,

1516
01:06:49,241 --> 01:06:52,660
I remember it like were they were all in
like a public toilet,

1517
01:06:52,820 --> 01:06:53,990
a shittery,
sugary,

1518
01:06:55,430 --> 01:06:57,430
sugary,
and they had it.

1519
01:06:57,431 --> 01:06:59,280
I'm like,
what at the time was,

1520
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:00,333
I guess the toilet paper,
which was like calf skin rags or 

1521
01:07:03,761 --> 01:07:04,594
something.
And they book and like white rats and 

1522
01:07:06,220 --> 01:07:08,140
they walk out and throw it in a pile.
It's like,

1523
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:11,070
how could that have smelled,
if that's accurate,

1524
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:12,760
if that's accurate.
You know what I mean?

1525
01:07:12,860 --> 01:07:13,693
Well,
that lives,

1526
01:07:14,510 --> 01:07:15,343
there it is Roman public toilets.
And they would go into like a tube and 

1527
01:07:19,691 --> 01:07:21,430
that tube would go right down the 
street.

1528
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:22,433
Yeah.
I imagine how the whole city smelled 

1529
01:07:23,831 --> 01:07:25,750
like shit.
Well that was one of the reasons why all

1530
01:07:25,751 --> 01:07:29,170
these people got sick.
Like when a disease would spread through

1531
01:07:29,171 --> 01:07:31,120
the city.
I mean there was no sanitation.

1532
01:07:31,121 --> 01:07:33,400
It was terrible.
But I mean,

1533
01:07:33,430 --> 01:07:34,263
how did,
they didn't even have like flushable 

1534
01:07:35,591 --> 01:07:36,311
things,
right?

1535
01:07:36,311 --> 01:07:37,144
Nothing flushed out.
They had developed aqua ducks so they 

1536
01:07:39,941 --> 01:07:44,941
just had a system of flowing water.
But it wasn't pressurized or anything,

1537
01:07:45,011 --> 01:07:45,844
so I just have to pick it up was one of 
the things that was cool about Pompei 

1538
01:07:49,301 --> 01:07:50,134
was they had a sauna.
They had figured out how to boil water 

1539
01:07:53,230 --> 01:07:57,320
and then they had the water would go 
through the floor and the walls they had

1540
01:07:57,450 --> 01:07:59,560
like,
like double spaced walls.

1541
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:00,633
So they had one outside wall and the 
inside wall and the heat would go 

1542
01:08:03,461 --> 01:08:06,040
through and they would go through a 
sentence.

1543
01:08:06,041 --> 01:08:06,874
So you could go into the sauna and you 
just like a regular sauna here and be 

1544
01:08:10,330 --> 01:08:11,990
hot as fuck in there.
Yeah,

1545
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:14,110
they were just pump a sauna.
That's it.

1546
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:18,620
Like they figured out how to make things
pretty cool for what they had,

1547
01:08:18,950 --> 01:08:19,783
but fuck live and back there.
But meanwhile tell me people aren't 

1548
01:08:22,671 --> 01:08:24,680
going to think like that a thousand 
years from now about us.

1549
01:08:24,860 --> 01:08:29,120
Those dummies shitting into a ceramic 
bowl and then hitting the water to flush

1550
01:08:29,121 --> 01:08:30,380
it away.
Idiots.

1551
01:08:30,710 --> 01:08:32,420
I can't imagine what it's going to be 
like.

1552
01:08:32,510 --> 01:08:36,170
Did we installed these toilets here?
That shoot hot water up your.

1553
01:08:36,171 --> 01:08:40,310
But you know those up or just cleaning 
it to a right in the hole.

1554
01:08:41,020 --> 01:08:43,040
It shoots right in that hole.
You got to be careful.

1555
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:43,873
Feels like you have to take a shit 
because he gets up in there and you're 

1556
01:08:45,291 --> 01:08:46,340
like,
oh I have to shit again.

1557
01:08:46,670 --> 01:08:47,503
But no,
it's just the water's literally getting 

1558
01:08:48,860 --> 01:08:52,880
through the door,
but it cleans your butthole so nice.

1559
01:08:53,030 --> 01:08:54,740
And after you have one of those,
you're like,

1560
01:08:54,741 --> 01:08:59,741
why would I ever use a regular toilet?
First Time I was like in the nineties.

1561
01:09:00,801 --> 01:09:02,390
In Japan.
Japan.

1562
01:09:02,391 --> 01:09:05,050
Yeah,
that's why I experienced it to me.

1563
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:08,000
For me it was just a few years ago,
but Jamie says he holds his shit.

1564
01:09:08,030 --> 01:09:08,863
Is that correct?
Preferred versus the home toilet that 

1565
01:09:11,151 --> 01:09:13,610
like why would,
why should it home if you'd like it make

1566
01:09:13,620 --> 01:09:14,453
sense to ship you.
Like I can keep this one in at bay for 

1567
01:09:16,881 --> 01:09:18,710
me honestly.
Honestly.

1568
01:09:18,711 --> 01:09:22,130
I mean like in Europe a bad day is a 
normal thing in our hotel room.

1569
01:09:22,131 --> 01:09:24,290
It's not here as much as not as good 
though.

1570
01:09:24,290 --> 01:09:25,910
I have a bad day in my house and never 
used it.

1571
01:09:25,911 --> 01:09:28,790
Once it's a magazine rack.
I throw magazines there.

1572
01:09:30,580 --> 01:09:33,290
Wash your hands.
It's just weird.

1573
01:09:33,291 --> 01:09:34,220
It's weird.
It's,

1574
01:09:34,230 --> 01:09:37,430
this doesn't work as good as it's.
And I think it's more for women.

1575
01:09:37,610 --> 01:09:38,443
Like,
no,

1576
01:09:39,250 --> 01:09:42,220
it's a cooter cleanser.
But um,

1577
01:09:42,650 --> 01:09:43,640
here's,
here's something funny.

1578
01:09:43,641 --> 01:09:44,474
He's like,
I just did this tour of Europe and we 

1579
01:09:46,731 --> 01:09:49,700
started noticing like,
and I'm not going to name countries by,

1580
01:09:49,940 --> 01:09:52,200
you know,
because I have fans and all them.

1581
01:09:52,210 --> 01:09:53,043
I don't want him to get upset,
but we noticed there's a different of 

1582
01:09:55,880 --> 01:09:56,713
some countries you can,
you get washcloths in your bathroom in 

1583
01:10:00,141 --> 01:10:03,830
some countries you don't [inaudible] and
me and my band,

1584
01:10:03,831 --> 01:10:05,660
you know,
came to the conclusion that from now on,

1585
01:10:05,661 --> 01:10:06,494
whenever we come to these countries 
where you don't get the wash cloths and 

1586
01:10:08,631 --> 01:10:09,464
your hotel room,
we're not going to shake hands with 

1587
01:10:11,181 --> 01:10:15,350
people that didn't,
didn't even wash closet in the bathroom.

1588
01:10:15,350 --> 01:10:16,340
I don't get it.
Yeah.

1589
01:10:16,460 --> 01:10:19,700
What do you wash your hands with bro?
You could wash your hands like this.

1590
01:10:19,701 --> 01:10:21,770
What are you washing your arse with,
man?

1591
01:10:21,980 --> 01:10:24,290
Shoving your hand crack up.
They're doing.

1592
01:10:24,350 --> 01:10:25,910
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

1593
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:28,630
I don't mind if you wash your face with 
your hands are your hands,

1594
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:29,473
but I'm not going to.
If I can't find a washcloth in the 

1595
01:10:34,070 --> 01:10:36,770
summer they have garden hoses attached 
to the toilet.

1596
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:39,080
They don't fuck around with all that hot
spicy food.

1597
01:10:39,380 --> 01:10:40,213
They know it's going to come out messy.
So they give you a goddamn garden hose 

1598
01:10:43,131 --> 01:10:45,860
to clean your asshole.
Was this Thailand in Thailand?

1599
01:10:45,890 --> 01:10:47,390
Everywhere.
Even the airport.

1600
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:48,313
What's the toilet?
The airport right next to the shit box 

1601
01:10:51,171 --> 01:10:52,004
was this goddamned garden hose.
I mean like when you would wash the car 

1602
01:10:54,471 --> 01:10:56,970
with like the pistol grip one.
Yeah,

1603
01:10:57,130 --> 01:11:02,130
let's just get that fucker back there 
and there it is right there.

1604
01:11:03,260 --> 01:11:04,400
Garden hose,
bom.

1605
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:06,500
Bom Gun.
They call them gun.

1606
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:08,060
Wow.
Was in Thailand.

1607
01:11:08,090 --> 01:11:12,310
Keep yourself clean with a squirt of 
water yet a squirt that.

1608
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:13,153
That shit.
That shit could move a boat across a 

1609
01:11:15,100 --> 01:11:17,520
dock.
Yeah.

1610
01:11:17,670 --> 01:11:18,503
Wow.
The direction our conversation's taken 

1611
01:11:20,371 --> 01:11:23,070
today to test the water pressure before 
you use it.

1612
01:11:23,490 --> 01:11:26,480
The British called the toilet hose,
that bum gun for a good reason.

1613
01:11:26,481 --> 01:11:27,314
The nozzle,
the end of the hose is shaped a bit 

1614
01:11:28,261 --> 01:11:31,110
loaded gun with a trigger.
The press to release the water.

1615
01:11:31,290 --> 01:11:32,490
Yeah.
Wow.

1616
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:33,353
Yeah.
They don't fuck around and tie and been 

1617
01:11:33,721 --> 01:11:35,040
in Thailand.
Obviously.

1618
01:11:35,130 --> 01:11:37,350
It's beautiful there.
People are so nice.

1619
01:11:37,380 --> 01:11:41,250
It's one of the friendliest places I've 
ever been in my life.

1620
01:11:41,251 --> 01:11:44,910
Like universally friendly and everybody 
looks at you and they all do this.

1621
01:11:45,060 --> 01:11:46,920
They make their hands like a lotus 
flower.

1622
01:11:47,010 --> 01:11:49,170
That's what they do.
They don't shake hands a lot.

1623
01:11:49,350 --> 01:11:53,340
They just touched their hands together 
and give you like a little bow there.

1624
01:11:53,350 --> 01:11:55,110
Is there.
Is there a wash cloth?

1625
01:11:55,380 --> 01:11:59,850
They just tie their hands are tired from
holding onto that hose.

1626
01:12:00,030 --> 01:12:02,140
Squeeze,
squeezing that bump gun something.

1627
01:12:04,130 --> 01:12:06,030
But uh,
the food there is fucking amazing.

1628
01:12:06,031 --> 01:12:06,864
If you like Thai food man,
you learn like from like the way they 

1629
01:12:10,801 --> 01:12:12,570
cook it in the motherland,
you know,

1630
01:12:12,650 --> 01:12:14,430
with all those fresh ingredients.
Thai food.

1631
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:17,380
I love Thai food.
Spicy Guide.

1632
01:12:17,390 --> 01:12:18,560
You like spicy?
Oh,

1633
01:12:20,250 --> 01:12:22,140
sands.
Being in Thailand,

1634
01:12:22,660 --> 01:12:24,810
this spot.
I was in a place in Melbourne,

1635
01:12:25,110 --> 01:12:28,020
Australia.
We talked about earlier the hottest Thai

1636
01:12:28,021 --> 01:12:30,120
food I ever had in my life.
Like so hot.

1637
01:12:30,121 --> 01:12:30,954
You're sweating and you can't stop 
eating it because the minute you stop 

1638
01:12:34,410 --> 01:12:36,510
eating it,
you're going to catch fire.

1639
01:12:36,630 --> 01:12:40,080
Have you ever been to exotic tie over on
Ventura and Woodland Hills?

1640
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:45,800
I feel like I have a super legit time.
Bunch of Thai people run it.

1641
01:12:46,711 --> 01:12:47,580
Super Nice people.

1642
01:12:47,580 --> 01:12:50,010
Food is jamming and there's a spot right
here.

1643
01:12:50,011 --> 01:12:52,920
Close.
Not far from the general area.

1644
01:12:53,210 --> 01:12:54,990
Uh,
jasmine tie.

1645
01:12:55,110 --> 01:12:56,410
Oh yeah,
yeah.

1646
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:58,620
There's a bunch of good Thai restaurants
in La.

1647
01:12:59,070 --> 01:12:59,903
Even been to a.
what's that place on sunset that's open 

1648
01:13:01,801 --> 01:13:03,420
real late.
Oh,

1649
01:13:03,421 --> 01:13:05,520
right there.
Next toy toy toy.

1650
01:13:05,580 --> 01:13:07,620
Toy ties grant to men.
That's a,

1651
01:13:07,621 --> 01:13:10,590
that's a great late night spot.
Like legit Thai food.

1652
01:13:10,591 --> 01:13:12,270
You get a 2:00
in the morning,

1653
01:13:12,510 --> 01:13:13,343
you know,
after a set of the commerce store 

1654
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:15,790
teaser.
Amazing.

1655
01:13:15,810 --> 01:13:18,270
That shit's terrible for your diabetic 
though.

1656
01:13:19,660 --> 01:13:23,430
There's like 180 grams of sugar,
but it's so delicious.

1657
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:26,890
So delicious.
But honestly,

1658
01:13:26,891 --> 01:13:28,980
you know,
that's like I used to drink so much coke

1659
01:13:29,180 --> 01:13:31,050
and then that's,
that's another one we talked about.

1660
01:13:31,051 --> 01:13:32,610
Weight.
That's the first thing I got rid of,

1661
01:13:32,660 --> 01:13:33,493
man was drinking Coca Cola.
The weight falls off about 20 pounds of 

1662
01:13:36,780 --> 01:13:38,220
the 35.

1663
01:13:38,220 --> 01:13:40,650
Now it just falls off.
You realize like,

1664
01:13:40,651 --> 01:13:41,484
what was I doing was I doing to myself 
and just a little bit of cardio and I 

1665
01:13:45,181 --> 01:13:47,520
was like every other day I was like,
whoa.

1666
01:13:48,530 --> 01:13:51,120
I just lost like,
like I said,

1667
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:54,380
$35 because I dropped five pounds out on
the road that I didn't even realize it.

1668
01:13:54,420 --> 01:13:56,460
Not even worth trying.
Wow.

1669
01:13:56,700 --> 01:14:00,600
Just continuing just consulting that.
And I think that food in Europe is a lot

1670
01:14:00,601 --> 01:14:02,250
cleaner just in general.
Yup.

1671
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:04,080
Yup.
Well they don't have a lot of.

1672
01:14:04,081 --> 01:14:05,370
Our,
first of all,

1673
01:14:05,371 --> 01:14:08,370
their wheat is like what you would call 
heirloom wheat.

1674
01:14:08,910 --> 01:14:09,743
They don't have a lot of the complex 
gluten's in our wheat that make it a 

1675
01:14:12,431 --> 01:14:14,670
little bit more difficult to process.
Um,

1676
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:17,910
this is all real thing.
Like people think there's some sort of a

1677
01:14:17,930 --> 01:14:18,763
like that people are exaggerating the 
effects of gluten and gluten 

1678
01:14:22,241 --> 01:14:23,074
intolerance.

1679
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:26,770
The issue is that at one point in time 
bread was different.

1680
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:29,050
It was just,
it was different,

1681
01:14:29,290 --> 01:14:30,123
but it was a lower yield,
so say like if you had an acre and you 

1682
01:14:33,401 --> 01:14:35,860
were planting wheat on it,
you would get way less wheat out of that

1683
01:14:35,861 --> 01:14:36,694
Acre than you would with the newer wheat
and the newer weed is just more complex 

1684
01:14:40,031 --> 01:14:41,920
gluten's in it and you get a higher 
yield.

1685
01:14:41,921 --> 01:14:43,300
And so that's what they're looking for 
and,

1686
01:14:43,301 --> 01:14:45,820
but when you eat it,
it's just harder to digest.

1687
01:14:45,821 --> 01:14:47,740
And it's just.
When I was in Italy,

1688
01:14:47,741 --> 01:14:49,570
man,
everybody skinny.

1689
01:14:49,930 --> 01:14:51,520
Okay.
They're all eating bread,

1690
01:14:51,580 --> 01:14:53,950
they're all eating pasta,
they're all eating pizza.

1691
01:14:53,980 --> 01:14:54,813
They're all skinny at the most.
These dudes who don't work out at the 

1692
01:14:57,551 --> 01:15:00,280
most get like a little paunch the most,
uh,

1693
01:15:00,281 --> 01:15:02,410
drinking wine every night.
They got a little paunch.

1694
01:15:02,980 --> 01:15:06,520
They also walk a lot more than us.
They also ride bikes a lot more than us.

1695
01:15:06,620 --> 01:15:08,020
Like they'll,
all those things,

1696
01:15:08,060 --> 01:15:11,910
but a lot of time in Holland this last 
trip and I couldn't find a fat person to

1697
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:13,600
just biking everywhere,
biking everywhere.

1698
01:15:13,601 --> 01:15:15,970
And they're eating cheese and bread all 
day.

1699
01:15:16,170 --> 01:15:17,003
Yeah.
So like literally every meal she's in 

1700
01:15:18,491 --> 01:15:19,324
bread with your meal,

1701
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:22,193
but they must be pissed that weed's 
legal everywhere else because people 

1702
01:15:23,831 --> 01:15:25,600
used to go to Holland,
specifically

1703
01:15:25,710 --> 01:15:28,470
the friends that own shops over there 
and they're like,

1704
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:28,981
yeah,
there's,

1705
01:15:28,981 --> 01:15:31,300
there's a lot of fuck.
What's going on right now is there's,

1706
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:32,850
um,
if I understood what he was telling me,

1707
01:15:32,851 --> 01:15:33,684
right?
Um,

1708
01:15:33,750 --> 01:15:34,583
Canada is investing shit.
Tons of money with the government over 

1709
01:15:38,761 --> 01:15:43,260
there to like corporate,
like start growing corporate we'd like,

1710
01:15:43,350 --> 01:15:46,050
and they're going to phase out to the 
locals and take it over.

1711
01:15:46,470 --> 01:15:47,303
Like they're going to phase out the 
coffee shop because there's weed isn't 

1712
01:15:50,311 --> 01:15:52,470
legal in Holland.
It's decriminalized.

1713
01:15:52,740 --> 01:15:57,390
If you own a weed shop,
you can only have let's say 500 grams of

1714
01:15:57,391 --> 01:15:59,930
time in the shop legally.
Alright.

1715
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:02,760
If you have a good shop,
you're moving that,

1716
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:05,760
you know,
in an afternoon.

1717
01:16:06,150 --> 01:16:08,010
So,
and getting,

1718
01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:08,933
bringing weed to your shop is illegal.
Like it's like it's a smuggling 

1719
01:16:12,721 --> 01:16:15,300
operation needs to be in there.
And once it's in there it's okay.

1720
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:16,620
Once it's in there,
you could sell it.

1721
01:16:16,770 --> 01:16:19,970
But getting it to your spot is,
it's fucking illegal to,

1722
01:16:20,010 --> 01:16:23,130
to move that much weed.
It's fucked up.

1723
01:16:23,131 --> 01:16:23,964
Like these guys I've know a couple of 
guys I want a cup of coffee shops and 

1724
01:16:25,741 --> 01:16:27,150
they're just like,
it's fuckery man.

1725
01:16:27,151 --> 01:16:28,650
You know,
it's like a constant.

1726
01:16:28,980 --> 01:16:33,020
It's like half a criminal operation.
They're running and it used to be the,

1727
01:16:33,021 --> 01:16:35,610
you get mushrooms,
you used to be able to get mushrooms,

1728
01:16:35,611 --> 01:16:38,680
you'd be able to get like a bunch of 
shit and now you can't.

1729
01:16:38,681 --> 01:16:40,620
Not like hard,
like narcotics,

1730
01:16:40,621 --> 01:16:43,440
like coke or anything like that.
But anything natural like mushrooms,

1731
01:16:43,620 --> 01:16:45,330
you could get acid.
When I was first in there,

1732
01:16:45,450 --> 01:16:47,880
I don't know if that was legal because I
was really young.

1733
01:16:47,881 --> 01:16:48,714
I just.

1734
01:16:49,580 --> 01:16:51,830
Well Holland,
just a wild ass place.

1735
01:16:51,831 --> 01:16:55,790
I mean that is the spot where like some 
of the best kickboxing ever came from.

1736
01:16:56,120 --> 01:16:56,953
It's weird.
One little spot in Europe and they 

1737
01:16:58,851 --> 01:17:02,480
created Ramon Dekkers,
Rob Cayman,

1738
01:17:02,510 --> 01:17:03,343
Ernesto hoost.
Like some of the greatest kickboxers of 

1739
01:17:05,270 --> 01:17:06,170
all time.

1740
01:17:07,370 --> 01:17:10,000
Everywhere.
Everywhere you go see them with like a

1741
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:11,330
gym.
It's amazing.

1742
01:17:11,390 --> 01:17:12,223
Yeah,
I mean it's just amazing that this one 

1743
01:17:13,821 --> 01:17:18,821
place became a hotbed for a source of 
their prize kickbox footballer.

1744
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:22,820
Kickboxing are probably the top two 
things.

1745
01:17:23,150 --> 01:17:23,983
I mean they literally have created some 
of the all time greatest kickboxers and 

1746
01:17:28,731 --> 01:17:31,190
it's not a big country.
It's really,

1747
01:17:31,191 --> 01:17:32,024
um,
and some of the greatest kickboxing 

1748
01:17:32,460 --> 01:17:34,380
coaches as well,
but some,

1749
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:37,220
it's amazing,
really unusual,

1750
01:17:37,310 --> 01:17:39,110
really unusual that,
that happened there.

1751
01:17:39,130 --> 01:17:39,963
And it's hard to describe why like no 
one really to be an interesting 

1752
01:17:43,930 --> 01:17:46,040
documentary.
So figure out the roots of that.

1753
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:47,540
Somebody went to Thailand,
you know,

1754
01:17:47,541 --> 01:17:48,940
somebody brought it back from Thailand 
and.

1755
01:17:48,950 --> 01:17:49,783
Yup.
Just switched it up and put their own 

1756
01:17:51,021 --> 01:17:52,310
little spin on it.
Yeah.

1757
01:17:52,311 --> 01:17:53,144
And a few guys went over to Thailand 
fuck some ties up to because what they 

1758
01:17:56,031 --> 01:17:58,520
had done is they incorporated a lot of 
western boxing,

1759
01:17:58,790 --> 01:18:01,670
like Ramon dekkers in particular was one
of the greats.

1760
01:18:02,090 --> 01:18:05,180
And uh,
what he did was he was a small guy,

1761
01:18:05,181 --> 01:18:06,014
like the same size as the ties,
which was unusual because a lot of the 

1762
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:09,793
people from Amsterdam or big people,
it's one of those places where I think 

1763
01:18:12,561 --> 01:18:16,430
the average height for a person who was 
like six feet tall.

1764
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:17,593
Yeah.
So it's an unusually tall place as shit 

1765
01:18:21,921 --> 01:18:24,800
going on.
Some fucking Viking DNA.

1766
01:18:25,370 --> 01:18:27,350
I was watching that show for awhile.
Vikings.

1767
01:18:27,351 --> 01:18:29,450
I got deep into that show,
that show it was pretty dark.

1768
01:18:29,540 --> 01:18:33,560
But Mrs Reagan got tired of seeing 
people get sorted up slashed to pieces.

1769
01:18:33,590 --> 01:18:36,440
She got bored with it.
It's pretty dark.

1770
01:18:36,470 --> 01:18:40,640
People would just get fucked up with 
arrows cut open and it's the whole show.

1771
01:18:40,641 --> 01:18:44,540
They're always going to war.
But they did their viking.

1772
01:18:44,541 --> 01:18:45,374
Yeah.
And they took a lot of mushrooms to 

1773
01:18:47,270 --> 01:18:50,900
pillage,
I believe is viking a way of life.

1774
01:18:51,380 --> 01:18:53,690
If you could go back in one time to 
like,

1775
01:18:53,691 --> 01:18:57,620
if you had like a time machine,
go back and watch one time in history,

1776
01:18:57,930 --> 01:19:01,180
what do you think you would go to see 
him go to see?

1777
01:19:01,181 --> 01:19:06,181
Like how people lived well at being very
smell sensitive.

1778
01:19:06,970 --> 01:19:10,100
It wouldn't be that far back.
I'd probably want to go.

1779
01:19:10,110 --> 01:19:12,830
I know that's not true.
I probably like,

1780
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:14,780
you know,
King Arthur era.

1781
01:19:14,870 --> 01:19:16,130
Yeah.
Like that kind of thing.

1782
01:19:16,131 --> 01:19:19,740
I was heavy dungeons and dragons.
Maybe go,

1783
01:19:20,050 --> 01:19:20,883
go,
go see if there's anything to add of 

1784
01:19:22,121 --> 01:19:23,720
that dragon shit.
You know,

1785
01:19:23,721 --> 01:19:24,620
the goal,
the grail,

1786
01:19:24,621 --> 01:19:27,410
you know what I mean?
Any of that drag shit.

1787
01:19:28,820 --> 01:19:32,940
I wonder what that was all based on.
Like why there's so many dragons in folk

1788
01:19:32,941 --> 01:19:33,774
lore,
in Chinese folklore and European 

1789
01:19:36,141 --> 01:19:40,160
folklore.
There's so many unrelated dragons.

1790
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:41,180
Well,
I mean,

1791
01:19:41,180 --> 01:19:43,000
you know,
there's people that have been,

1792
01:19:43,070 --> 01:19:43,903
you know,
I've watched a lot of ancient aliens so 

1793
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:47,440
that they'll always have an explanation.

1794
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:49,640
My man with the hair,
Joe,

1795
01:19:49,690 --> 01:19:50,610
Joe,
sucralose.

1796
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:54,920
Georges is a podcast a long time ago.
I love that guy,

1797
01:19:54,921 --> 01:19:57,320
dude.
He's my favorite dude on that show,

1798
01:19:57,321 --> 01:19:58,670
man.
He's a good dude.

1799
01:19:59,510 --> 01:20:01,310
I don't necessarily agree with 
everything.

1800
01:20:01,311 --> 01:20:02,990
They say no to everything,
but that's.

1801
01:20:03,030 --> 01:20:04,850
There's a,
there's merit to some of it,

1802
01:20:04,851 --> 01:20:05,684
man.
There was a show you watch with your 

1803
01:20:07,020 --> 01:20:07,853
boys at like 1:00
in the morning and you get baked and 

1804
01:20:09,811 --> 01:20:10,644
everybody laughed.
You ever watched the vice virgin where 

1805
01:20:12,391 --> 01:20:17,391
like action Bronson guys are getting a 
complete fucking nonsense,

1806
01:20:19,981 --> 01:20:22,290
but if you're high,
it's fucking fun to watch.

1807
01:20:22,291 --> 01:20:23,124
He came on the podcast.
I never seen a dude smoked more weed in 

1808
01:20:25,321 --> 01:20:29,820
my life.
He smoked by himself at least six blunts

1809
01:20:30,090 --> 01:20:32,910
during the podcast.
While it's so hard,

1810
01:20:32,911 --> 01:20:33,744
man,
I don't think that we'd really fucks 

1811
01:20:34,501 --> 01:20:35,370
with them anymore.
Man.

1812
01:20:35,380 --> 01:20:36,860
I can think it takes that much weed.

1813
01:20:36,860 --> 01:20:39,810
He just kept going and I got paranoid 
just watching them.

1814
01:20:39,811 --> 01:20:40,890
I'm like,
oh man.

1815
01:20:40,930 --> 01:20:44,280
I smoked a little bit with them,
but I mean I got to keep the ship on the

1816
01:20:44,310 --> 01:20:46,390
water.
Exactly.

1817
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:48,900
You got to let me keep my hands on the 
wheel,

1818
01:20:48,901 --> 01:20:51,550
sir.
Like he just kept going with that.

1819
01:20:51,590 --> 01:20:53,750
We took a photo of the astro after it 
was over.

1820
01:20:53,770 --> 01:20:54,930
Was preposterous.
Was like,

1821
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:58,710
look at that.
That's one show that he's a crazy guy,

1822
01:20:58,711 --> 01:20:59,800
man.
Fun Dude though.

1823
01:20:59,900 --> 01:21:01,200
He's a good guy.
I love that.

1824
01:21:01,201 --> 01:21:02,430
Fuck.
That's delicious.

1825
01:21:02,890 --> 01:21:03,723
Show.
No,

1826
01:21:04,020 --> 01:21:05,950
that's a great show,
you know,

1827
01:21:06,220 --> 01:21:08,460
without alchemist is a good friend of 
mine.

1828
01:21:08,461 --> 01:21:10,110
I've known him since he was young,
so they're good buddies.

1829
01:21:10,111 --> 01:21:11,460
I've met him.
I hung out with a few times.

1830
01:21:11,461 --> 01:21:12,360
It's really fun guy,
man.

1831
01:21:13,050 --> 01:21:15,150
It's a unique idea for a show because,
you know,

1832
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:16,950
Action Bronson used to be a chef.

1833
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:17,930
Yeah.
Yeah.

1834
01:21:17,930 --> 01:21:21,960
So seeing him like interact with food 
and she has like,

1835
01:21:21,961 --> 01:21:22,794
he's.
He really knows about food and really 

1836
01:21:24,061 --> 01:21:24,900
understands food.
Yeah,

1837
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:25,913
I think he should have a cooking show he
actually know can whip up some fucking 

1838
01:21:29,270 --> 01:21:30,560
mean food.
Yeah,

1839
01:21:30,570 --> 01:21:34,560
right.
Like we like now that Bourdain's gone,

1840
01:21:34,770 --> 01:21:39,280
like we'd need more of those kind of 
shows that explore food and bordain show

1841
01:21:39,281 --> 01:21:40,114
changed the way I feel about food.
I used to think of food is just 

1842
01:21:43,051 --> 01:21:43,884
something that tastes really good.
I didn't think of it as an art form and 

1843
01:21:46,521 --> 01:21:51,300
then I watched his show and the reverend
he had for chefs and for the creation of

1844
01:21:51,301 --> 01:21:52,950
food and made me realize like,
oh,

1845
01:21:52,951 --> 01:21:55,920
this is an art form that I was ignorant 
of.

1846
01:21:56,310 --> 01:21:58,590
I didn't think of it the right way on 
all levels.

1847
01:21:58,591 --> 01:21:59,424
Not just like the high chef level,
he brings it to the home front where 

1848
01:22:02,191 --> 01:22:06,100
it's like even as local,
let's eat,

1849
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:08,000
Cook and some sandwiches.

1850
01:22:08,640 --> 01:22:10,260
Making sandwiches.
No,

1851
01:22:10,410 --> 01:22:12,990
you're right man.
Like street food level.

1852
01:22:12,991 --> 01:22:16,590
He loves Tony.
Loved Street Tacos and Shit.

1853
01:22:16,620 --> 01:22:18,210
He would go everywhere and by street 
food.

1854
01:22:18,260 --> 01:22:21,480
Me Honestly,
when you're cooking,

1855
01:22:21,481 --> 01:22:22,890
you feel like that though.
[inaudible].

1856
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:25,020
You just now I see you cooking all the 
time.

1857
01:22:25,021 --> 01:22:25,854
Whenever you're posting.
This should never invite me over to 

1858
01:22:27,210 --> 01:22:30,420
somebody else.
I was going to set it up here.

1859
01:22:30,780 --> 01:22:31,613
I was going to set a thing up here,
but they never figured out how to get 

1860
01:22:33,721 --> 01:22:34,554
ventilation.
Here we have a grill back there that's 

1861
01:22:35,761 --> 01:22:36,594
never been used.
It's just sitting back there looking at 

1862
01:22:38,581 --> 01:22:39,414
me.
He's taken a stake to be nice and pink 

1863
01:22:42,781 --> 01:22:47,190
in the middle and gorgeous.
He's drinking wine.

1864
01:22:47,220 --> 01:22:48,180
I wonder why.
See?

1865
01:22:48,181 --> 01:22:49,014
This is how.
How stony his show is like they let him 

1866
01:22:51,481 --> 01:22:56,481
wear a shirt that you can't wear,
so they had a blur out his shirt thing.

1867
01:22:57,860 --> 01:22:58,651
Oh,
okay man.

1868
01:22:58,651 --> 01:22:59,690
You can't wear that shirt.
All.

1869
01:22:59,750 --> 01:23:00,840
Yo,
I got it all.

1870
01:23:00,850 --> 01:23:02,640
This is.
This is what I'm wearing.

1871
01:23:02,641 --> 01:23:05,980
So do what you gotta do.
Exactly.

1872
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:09,430
So they got to follow him around.
That blur thing drives me nuts.

1873
01:23:10,270 --> 01:23:11,980
Like what is it,
what could it possibly be that.

1874
01:23:11,981 --> 01:23:12,920
So,
but it's,

1875
01:23:13,150 --> 01:23:15,670
there's,
there's times when I see cyclists back.

1876
01:23:15,850 --> 01:23:17,830
Alright,
back when he had that loser video,

1877
01:23:18,190 --> 01:23:21,940
the first thing that comes up when the 
video is him in a mask that's blurred.

1878
01:23:22,910 --> 01:23:23,743
Right.
And I,

1879
01:23:23,750 --> 01:23:25,930
and I was like,
what the fuck?

1880
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:28,750
Why would,
why would you wear it was purposely done

1881
01:23:28,751 --> 01:23:31,840
like I think sometimes maybe it's like,
yeah,

1882
01:23:31,940 --> 01:23:33,130
it's like,
what the fuck?

1883
01:23:34,060 --> 01:23:36,430
What is that?
As his back being a Weirdo.

1884
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:37,990
You're but what is it makes you go,
like,

1885
01:23:38,140 --> 01:23:41,040
what the fuck is it?
He's a fascinating guy to,

1886
01:23:41,250 --> 01:23:43,090
you know,
he's a devout scientologist.

1887
01:23:43,300 --> 01:23:45,750
Yeah.
Which is his dad did,

1888
01:23:45,820 --> 01:23:47,830
is uh,
is an amazing string arranger,

1889
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:49,710
an orchestrator.
And he,

1890
01:23:49,740 --> 01:23:50,573
he,
he did a couple of my albums where I'm 

1891
01:23:52,121 --> 01:23:52,240
going.

1892
01:23:52,240 --> 01:23:54,150
I had string arrangements and stuff.
Really?

1893
01:23:54,190 --> 01:23:55,390
Yeah.
Yeah.

1894
01:23:55,391 --> 01:23:59,740
I mean he's a legit musician.
Like a really interesting back is his,

1895
01:23:59,860 --> 01:24:02,830
is his next level.
You don't hear about him that often.

1896
01:24:03,130 --> 01:24:04,290
Again,
another thing,

1897
01:24:04,300 --> 01:24:06,240
I think it's the same kind of thing,
dude.

1898
01:24:06,450 --> 01:24:08,800
It doesn't.
He's not playing the game.

1899
01:24:09,350 --> 01:24:10,183
I mean,
you know,

1900
01:24:10,210 --> 01:24:11,620
he makes music.
He's just an artist.

1901
01:24:11,621 --> 01:24:13,450
When it's time to make music.
It's music.

1902
01:24:13,570 --> 01:24:15,370
Yeah.
There's still.

1903
01:24:15,450 --> 01:24:16,960
I mean,
in other words,

1904
01:24:16,961 --> 01:24:17,794
it's for me,
I'm sorry,

1905
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:19,530
but it's not,
it's,

1906
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:20,171
it's like,
okay,

1907
01:24:20,171 --> 01:24:21,670
this is a product,
this record.

1908
01:24:21,700 --> 01:24:22,840
Right.
But it's not a product.

1909
01:24:22,841 --> 01:24:24,940
To me,
it's like I did eight years of my life,

1910
01:24:25,110 --> 01:24:27,970
you know what I mean?
I didn't make it because I was concerned

1911
01:24:27,971 --> 01:24:29,560
about keeping my otherwise that's why 
the guy,

1912
01:24:29,980 --> 01:24:31,900
because they got to put a record out 
every year.

1913
01:24:32,290 --> 01:24:33,280
Those are the guys.
I'm like,

1914
01:24:33,281 --> 01:24:34,630
Whoa,
how do you fucking.

1915
01:24:35,170 --> 01:24:36,400
That's all us,
you know,

1916
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:40,740
that takes a lot to put a fucking room,
especially if it's going to be good.

1917
01:24:41,020 --> 01:24:42,820
So anybody that can put out a record 
every year,

1918
01:24:42,821 --> 01:24:45,340
that's good.
That's next level.

1919
01:24:46,060 --> 01:24:46,893
Yeah.
Well Louis Ck was doing that for awhile 

1920
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:49,481
at standup.
Yeah.

1921
01:24:49,481 --> 01:24:51,340
Yeah.
That is hard to do.

1922
01:24:51,341 --> 01:24:52,174
George Carlin did it every year.
George Carlin did a standup special 

1923
01:24:54,971 --> 01:24:57,820
every year and to us to to all stand up 
comics.

1924
01:24:57,821 --> 01:24:59,350
Will we all get together and talk about 
that?

1925
01:24:59,351 --> 01:25:01,450
Everybody kind of agrees.
It's almost impossible.

1926
01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:02,763
He did it,
but very few people could do it and not 

1927
01:25:07,031 --> 01:25:10,210
to criticize Carlin because Carlin and 
did it and pulled it off,

1928
01:25:10,690 --> 01:25:14,200
but most of us feel like that's not 
enough time.

1929
01:25:14,410 --> 01:25:15,243
Like you need more time to let it cook.
Need more time to add twists to never 

1930
01:25:20,170 --> 01:25:21,003
had a record come out.
Like I think the shortest period would 

1931
01:25:23,470 --> 01:25:24,303
be two years,
two and a half years and that's you 

1932
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:28,720
probably just constantly going at it.

1933
01:25:29,070 --> 01:25:29,903
Anytime I wasn't touring or something 
and we locked in a room somewhere and 

1934
01:25:32,321 --> 01:25:34,900
trying to make music.
Now when you record,

1935
01:25:35,110 --> 01:25:37,450
when you will like say if you're going 
to lay down an album,

1936
01:25:37,451 --> 01:25:38,284
do you have everything completely mapped
out before you go into the studio or do 

1937
01:25:41,501 --> 01:25:43,270
you fuck around with it while you're in 
there?

1938
01:25:43,870 --> 01:25:46,480
Will the process for this album in 
particular,

1939
01:25:46,481 --> 01:25:51,481
which was wild because again,
when layla was born and the disease we,

1940
01:25:52,861 --> 01:25:53,261
we,
we,

1941
01:25:53,261 --> 01:25:55,780
we found out she was diagnosed with 
cystic fibrosis.

1942
01:25:56,410 --> 01:26:00,340
I actually was planning to not tour any 
of that anymore,

1943
01:26:00,341 --> 01:26:02,680
but I was going to write songs.
I was gonna go to.

1944
01:26:02,681 --> 01:26:03,514
I went to Nashville,
started hanging out with a few 

1945
01:26:05,361 --> 01:26:06,920
songwriters out there and wrote some 
stuff.

1946
01:26:06,921 --> 01:26:08,000
One of the songs,
it ain't easy,

1947
01:26:08,001 --> 01:26:11,240
which I played years ago on your podcast
is on this album.

1948
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:13,660
Um,
uh,

1949
01:26:14,220 --> 01:26:16,190
so I wrote some songs with people but 
it,

1950
01:26:16,191 --> 01:26:18,290
the intention was they were going to be 
for other people.

1951
01:26:18,710 --> 01:26:22,370
So I recorded them in a very kind of 
plain Jane Way.

1952
01:26:22,790 --> 01:26:26,540
Not My spin on what they would have been
an after a few years.

1953
01:26:26,590 --> 01:26:31,590
I just never really pursued.
It's too much of a sales pitch I had,

1954
01:26:31,910 --> 01:26:32,743
would have had you have to go out and 
like be that smooth or selling your 

1955
01:26:34,401 --> 01:26:39,401
songs and it just never appealed to me.
And so after a few years I,

1956
01:26:40,101 --> 01:26:40,934
I'm just,
I did an acoustic record and then I 

1957
01:26:43,641 --> 01:26:45,590
started touring that for awhile,
just old songs,

1958
01:26:45,591 --> 01:26:48,560
but I recorded them acoustically.
And um,

1959
01:26:50,690 --> 01:26:51,523
then,
uh,

1960
01:26:51,950 --> 01:26:53,630
after that was done and I realized,
all right,

1961
01:26:53,690 --> 01:26:55,340
you know,
I need to keep working,

1962
01:26:56,420 --> 01:26:57,253
what am I gonna do?
I went back and revisited some of these 

1963
01:26:58,431 --> 01:27:00,410
songs,
but I realized after we record them,

1964
01:27:00,620 --> 01:27:04,430
that's why I didn't see that they were 
my songs because I recorded the demo way

1965
01:27:04,431 --> 01:27:06,170
that I thought other people would want 
to use them.

1966
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:09,090
So I went and rerecorded about,
I dunno,

1967
01:27:09,140 --> 01:27:11,120
five or six of the songs that were 
already here.

1968
01:27:12,050 --> 01:27:14,410
And then my buddy evidence from dilated 
peoples,

1969
01:27:14,940 --> 01:27:15,773
um,
got involved with me and we recorded a 

1970
01:27:16,791 --> 01:27:17,624
few of these rap tracks and it started 
kind of coming together and it kind of 

1971
01:27:19,521 --> 01:27:20,354
started coming together in a similar way
that the original Whitey Ford sings the 

1972
01:27:22,461 --> 01:27:23,294
blues record it.
That's why I kind of also named it what 

1973
01:27:25,401 --> 01:27:26,780
it is.
Um,

1974
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:27,873
there was a lot of similarities and I 
feel like I just pulled everything from 

1975
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:33,713
every,
every part of the tool box that I've 

1976
01:27:34,671 --> 01:27:36,890
learned from since I started,
you know,

1977
01:27:36,950 --> 01:27:37,783
what it was the ice tea years or the 
house of pain years or the Whitey Ford 

1978
01:27:40,641 --> 01:27:41,474
years.
I just drew on it all and trying to see 

1979
01:27:43,821 --> 01:27:44,654
what you,
like I said it was the eight years of 

1980
01:27:45,501 --> 01:27:46,334
life.
It's not like a literal representation 

1981
01:27:49,461 --> 01:27:50,294
of what's happened to me,
but it's an emotional journey of like 

1982
01:27:52,461 --> 01:27:53,294
all the kinds of feelings and shit that 
I like a lot of struggles and a lot of 

1983
01:27:56,180 --> 01:27:56,721
it's,
it's,

1984
01:27:56,721 --> 01:27:58,280
it's,
it's my best record,

1985
01:27:58,430 --> 01:28:00,170
you know,
but eight years right here.

1986
01:28:00,170 --> 01:28:03,500
So I've never been in no rush.
That's a big statement,

1987
01:28:03,501 --> 01:28:05,360
but it's your best record.
It's my best record ever.

1988
01:28:05,450 --> 01:28:07,130
Um,
I'm confident in it.

1989
01:28:07,210 --> 01:28:08,390
It's,
is it available everywhere?

1990
01:28:08,470 --> 01:28:12,610
Like the shit out of it.
I own my masters.

1991
01:28:13,030 --> 01:28:14,330
I mean,
how does that work?

1992
01:28:15,550 --> 01:28:17,810
Do you get more extreme?
Well,

1993
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:20,180
if you own your masters,
you get paid outright.

1994
01:28:20,181 --> 01:28:22,370
Like you know,
you're the label on my own label.

1995
01:28:22,430 --> 01:28:26,420
So the people that complain about not 
getting paid by streaming or people that

1996
01:28:26,421 --> 01:28:27,254
are signed to record deals that are 
getting a small piece of what the 

1997
01:28:30,681 --> 01:28:33,800
masters getting a.
do you own the master,

1998
01:28:34,420 --> 01:28:35,253
you know,
so streaming is viable for someone who 

1999
01:28:37,971 --> 01:28:40,520
owns the map.
I mean it's viable period.

2000
01:28:40,521 --> 01:28:41,660
I mean,
kids know what I mean.

2001
01:28:41,661 --> 01:28:42,980
That's the way it is.
It's just the,

2002
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:44,870
it's the future.
I mean now.

2003
01:28:45,170 --> 01:28:48,350
But the people who say it doesn't pay 
their in shitty deals,

2004
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:49,260
you know what I mean?

2005
01:28:49,260 --> 01:28:50,120
Because it,
it pays.

2006
01:28:50,210 --> 01:28:52,280
No,
I would like it to pay a little better.

2007
01:28:52,281 --> 01:28:53,180
But you know,
he pays.

2008
01:28:53,181 --> 01:28:53,900
He pays.
All right.

2009
01:28:53,900 --> 01:28:57,260
Who Was it?
I think if you take a million streams it

2010
01:28:57,261 --> 01:29:02,261
equals out to around $8,000.
That sounds like it just in general,

2011
01:29:02,401 --> 01:29:05,070
like that's the payment from,
for what that is to have to a label,

2012
01:29:05,071 --> 01:29:07,970
like it would be around a million 
streams.

2013
01:29:07,971 --> 01:29:09,690
This is about the equivalent of about 
eight grand.

2014
01:29:10,290 --> 01:29:11,850
And uh,
that doesn't sound like a lot,

2015
01:29:11,851 --> 01:29:13,200
but a million streams is like,
you know,

2016
01:29:13,201 --> 01:29:16,620
a thousand guys that or people fans of 
yours that stream you're shit,

2017
01:29:16,650 --> 01:29:18,360
whatever thousand times,
100 times,

2018
01:29:18,860 --> 01:29:19,441
you know,
it's not,

2019
01:29:19,441 --> 01:29:20,274
it goes quicker.
And I think drake like streamed a 

2020
01:29:22,410 --> 01:29:24,600
billion streams as first week.
Right.

2021
01:29:24,810 --> 01:29:26,240
Know that's a nice chunk of change,
man.

2022
01:29:26,280 --> 01:29:30,000
David crosby was tweeting about how bad 
streaming deals are,

2023
01:29:30,450 --> 01:29:33,810
but that is because he has a bad deal as
he doesn't know what his master.

2024
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:34,380
Yeah.
If,

2025
01:29:34,380 --> 01:29:36,780
if he's recording a deal for another 
record,

2026
01:29:36,810 --> 01:29:38,280
for the record company,
you know what I mean?

2027
01:29:38,710 --> 01:29:40,570
And he's all his older songs.
Oh,

2028
01:29:40,571 --> 01:29:41,220
that's.
Yeah.

2029
01:29:41,220 --> 01:29:43,950
Then he's probably got shit deals on.
I mean some of my older stuff,

2030
01:29:43,951 --> 01:29:45,580
I don't get paid on what I feel like I 
should,

2031
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:48,180
but it's like the stuff since I've owned
my masters,

2032
01:29:48,181 --> 01:29:50,700
which is the last 15 years of my life,
you know what I mean?

2033
01:29:51,090 --> 01:29:51,923
It's fascinating for me on the outside 
looking at what happens with labels and 

2034
01:29:55,300 --> 01:29:56,720
how they do things.
It's,

2035
01:29:56,760 --> 01:29:58,470
it's just,
it's amazing.

2036
01:29:58,471 --> 01:29:59,304
They're sort of survival instincts.
How they figured out how to labels or 

2037
01:30:02,461 --> 01:30:06,720
signing casters now because of streaming
streaming.

2038
01:30:07,170 --> 01:30:09,760
You should be getting checks from this 
Joe.

2039
01:30:09,810 --> 01:30:11,550
I don't,
I don't allow them to stream me.

2040
01:30:11,940 --> 01:30:14,940
But honestly you could come in door a 
spotify.

2041
01:30:14,941 --> 01:30:17,250
I say nope.
Well you'd probably have to be exclusive

2042
01:30:17,251 --> 01:30:22,170
to one of them is the deal to um,
well either way what they are is just,

2043
01:30:22,200 --> 01:30:23,640
it's not just streaming digital.

2044
01:30:23,640 --> 01:30:27,450
Your Youtube views are streaming.
That's streaming doesn't have to be with

2045
01:30:27,451 --> 01:30:28,490
a streaming service.
Right?

2046
01:30:28,770 --> 01:30:29,760
I mean,
but you,

2047
01:30:29,790 --> 01:30:32,370
you should have a digital company that 
is representing you,

2048
01:30:32,371 --> 01:30:35,260
that's collecting all that.
If you don't know,

2049
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:37,410
I just make sure.
Yeah.

2050
01:30:37,411 --> 01:30:39,530
But that's like streaming.
It's,

2051
01:30:39,590 --> 01:30:40,423
you know what the youtube thing,
the most fascinating thing about it is 

2052
01:30:41,970 --> 01:30:44,460
it's only youtube.
That's the crazy thing.

2053
01:30:44,461 --> 01:30:45,294
We think about how big the Internet is 
and there's really only one thing like 

2054
01:30:48,091 --> 01:30:49,080
youtube,
it's a,

2055
01:30:49,140 --> 01:30:49,973
it was a good moment.
They came and the branding and 

2056
01:30:52,350 --> 01:30:54,050
everything they did.
I saw like,

2057
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:56,910
I don't know if it was a documentary 
because it wasn't full length,

2058
01:30:56,911 --> 01:30:58,710
but it might've been just like a little 
like feature,

2059
01:30:58,711 --> 01:31:01,650
like within a news kind of segment thing
about how the,

2060
01:31:01,651 --> 01:31:04,230
you know,
the original videos that were huge on,

2061
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:07,310
on youtube or like a kid biting another 
kid.

2062
01:31:07,310 --> 01:31:09,630
And like the original first for the 
longest time,

2063
01:31:09,631 --> 01:31:13,290
the most played video on youtube was the
charlie biting the kid or something,

2064
01:31:13,291 --> 01:31:15,360
you know,
that's where it all came from.

2065
01:31:15,361 --> 01:31:18,160
Like it almost came from America's home 
video,

2066
01:31:18,780 --> 01:31:19,613
like funniest home video kind of thing.
Youtube kind of filled in that void for 

2067
01:31:22,561 --> 01:31:25,140
a long time.
They were memes before there were memes.

2068
01:31:25,141 --> 01:31:26,720
They were just viral videos,
you know,

2069
01:31:27,250 --> 01:31:28,860
um,
that's so long ago.

2070
01:31:28,870 --> 01:31:31,530
That's crazy.
It's like a decade ago and that,

2071
01:31:31,550 --> 01:31:35,040
well,
I mean the necessity of having to change

2072
01:31:35,041 --> 01:31:37,110
the music business is what changed 
youtube,

2073
01:31:37,111 --> 01:31:37,944
you know,
because they caught on like ritv knows 

2074
01:31:39,140 --> 01:31:42,360
and play videos anymore and nobody's 
buying records.

2075
01:31:42,361 --> 01:31:43,910
So we got to.
So you know,

2076
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:45,730
the whole,
the whole thing for the longest was like

2077
01:31:45,780 --> 01:31:46,613
when the bottom had really fallen out 
for a while of making any money off of 

2078
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:50,753
actual records was like,
well you can pull my record and you can 

2079
01:31:53,281 --> 01:31:54,114
download my record,
but you can't download the tee shirt 

2080
01:31:56,310 --> 01:31:56,760
that.

2081
01:31:56,760 --> 01:31:57,593
So it became sell the lifestyle.
So the music became background music to 

2082
01:32:01,790 --> 01:32:02,623
everything else.
It was part of the lifestyle and the 

2083
01:32:03,821 --> 01:32:07,330
cars and this and all I wanted you to do
is really go by this limited edition tee

2084
01:32:07,331 --> 01:32:09,250
shirt that I'm sending you right now.
You know what I mean?

2085
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:12,880
That's what that's the game changed into
and it's still that.

2086
01:32:13,030 --> 01:32:14,980
You know what I mean?
That's why the fuck are you in the troll

2087
01:32:14,990 --> 01:32:17,230
ism and all that because people want 
eyes on them.

2088
01:32:17,231 --> 01:32:19,630
So the next thing they have the 
opportunity to sell,

2089
01:32:20,380 --> 01:32:21,430
they can sell.
Yeah.

2090
01:32:21,431 --> 01:32:22,264
That's what's interesting to me about 
labels is now labels get a piece of 

2091
01:32:24,881 --> 01:32:26,740
everything.
They do these three 60 deals.

2092
01:32:26,920 --> 01:32:30,970
Don't say Chris,
that was unheard of.

2093
01:32:31,390 --> 01:32:33,910
You didn't get that many tee shirts or 
you get piece of it.

2094
01:32:33,911 --> 01:32:35,980
They get pieces of live money because 
every,

2095
01:32:35,981 --> 01:32:36,814
you know,
it's like how cool it used to be like I 

2096
01:32:39,071 --> 01:32:39,880
had to pay you.

2097
01:32:39,880 --> 01:32:41,170
I used to be like,
alright,

2098
01:32:41,380 --> 01:32:43,570
a record label would give me half a 
million dollars.

2099
01:32:43,810 --> 01:32:46,240
All right.
And I'd go and make a record with that.

2100
01:32:46,300 --> 01:32:48,600
I'd have,
I could spend whatever I want and making

2101
01:32:48,630 --> 01:32:50,920
a record and whatever the rest of money 
leftover was mine.

2102
01:32:50,921 --> 01:32:51,754
That 500 grand was mine.
I spend it all making the record or I 

2103
01:32:53,381 --> 01:32:56,330
could spend 50 grand making a record and
pocket the rest.

2104
01:32:56,331 --> 01:32:58,170
That was up to me.
Um,

2105
01:32:58,930 --> 01:33:00,220
and then after that,
my job,

2106
01:33:00,221 --> 01:33:02,040
your job as a label is to sell that 
record.

2107
01:33:02,050 --> 01:33:02,883
My job was to hit the road and go tour 
and I go to her for a few years and at 

2108
01:33:06,131 --> 01:33:06,964
first I'm not even making money touring 
and you're giving me money to go out 

2109
01:33:09,311 --> 01:33:10,840
there and tour.
It's called tour support.

2110
01:33:10,841 --> 01:33:11,674
That used to be.
And that actually gets added onto your 

2111
01:33:13,721 --> 01:33:15,370
bill.
You didn't get paid?

2112
01:33:15,810 --> 01:33:16,030
No.

2113
01:33:16,030 --> 01:33:16,863
You would get like money for tour.
But like it wouldn't cover like a bus 

2114
01:33:19,481 --> 01:33:20,314
and abandon all this.
So that the label would supplement that 

2115
01:33:22,571 --> 01:33:23,404
with what they called tour support,
which would also become part of the 

2116
01:33:25,841 --> 01:33:27,010
debt.
You owe the label,

2117
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:28,353
but as you built your live audience,
your guarantees would go up sooner or 

2118
01:33:32,531 --> 01:33:33,364
later you can stop taking that money and
then your record sales would pay that 

2119
01:33:37,841 --> 01:33:38,674
off hopefully if you were doing well 
enough and now you've got your own 

2120
01:33:40,811 --> 01:33:45,150
stream of revenue with live t shirts,
all this other outside shit that yours.

2121
01:33:45,750 --> 01:33:49,450
That's the way it was when I came up.
Now it's like that's not a deal.

2122
01:33:49,730 --> 01:33:50,563
They want it how they sneak that in 
because when napster and shit drop the 

2123
01:33:54,551 --> 01:33:57,190
bottom out of the record business,
nobody was paying for records.

2124
01:33:57,430 --> 01:33:58,263
Labels weren't going to give you a half 
a million dollars just for your record 

2125
01:34:01,181 --> 01:34:02,740
because nobody was buying records.

2126
01:34:02,740 --> 01:34:05,440
They want to sell your tee shirts to.
Isn't that amazing?

2127
01:34:05,441 --> 01:34:06,274
Note they figured out how to stay alive 
like that just because they always knew 

2128
01:34:08,831 --> 01:34:10,890
that people are going to be needy.
It always it.

2129
01:34:11,050 --> 01:34:11,883
It all boils down to this too,
and I host somebody one day like really 

2130
01:34:14,231 --> 01:34:18,340
investigates this and make some sort of 
documentary about it is like they had so

2131
01:34:18,341 --> 01:34:20,650
many opportunities to be ahead of the 
movie industry,

2132
01:34:20,651 --> 01:34:21,484
didn't take the same hit.
They took hits and they deal dealt with 

2133
01:34:23,981 --> 01:34:24,814
piracy,
but they,

2134
01:34:25,750 --> 01:34:27,880
the music industry had a moment,
if you remember,

2135
01:34:27,881 --> 01:34:28,714
there was like some kids that got in 
trouble for downloading ridiculous 

2136
01:34:31,211 --> 01:34:32,044
amounts of music and their parents were 
being held responsible and the music 

2137
01:34:34,901 --> 01:34:38,680
industry backed off of it because the 
news wasn't good.

2138
01:34:39,220 --> 01:34:41,500
The movie industry never backed off of 
that kind of shit.

2139
01:34:41,501 --> 01:34:42,334
They've told you,
we're going to fucking sue your life 

2140
01:34:43,511 --> 01:34:44,250
off.

2141
01:34:44,250 --> 01:34:45,083
People did get sued for your music,
but the music industry backed off 

2142
01:34:47,771 --> 01:34:48,604
though.
They didn't put the pedal down and keep 

2143
01:34:49,841 --> 01:34:51,880
the foot on the neck like,
you're going to steal this.

2144
01:34:52,120 --> 01:34:54,190
This costs.
You got to remember back then,

2145
01:34:54,191 --> 01:34:55,600
if I were to got a half a million 
dollars,

2146
01:34:55,660 --> 01:34:57,950
I probably would have spent up to to 
have that on a record,

2147
01:34:58,190 --> 01:35:02,210
$200,000
just on them making studio time.

2148
01:35:02,540 --> 01:35:04,430
Whoever's got to be involved,
engineers,

2149
01:35:04,431 --> 01:35:06,980
producers,
200 grand off top,

2150
01:35:06,981 --> 01:35:09,960
just minimum we would have spent on a 
record and then it gets.

2151
01:35:10,040 --> 01:35:11,580
You go out and people steal it.
Right.

2152
01:35:11,690 --> 01:35:12,500
You know what I mean?
It's the same,

2153
01:35:12,500 --> 01:35:15,770
you know we're going with do you ever 
download shit for free?

2154
01:35:17,750 --> 01:35:20,750
My thing we not.
At first my thing became later like,

2155
01:35:20,810 --> 01:35:22,100
okay,
this is what,

2156
01:35:22,140 --> 01:35:23,390
this is the wave,
whatever.

2157
01:35:23,690 --> 01:35:24,523
But if I adapt my.
My philosophy was if I downloaded your 

2158
01:35:26,691 --> 01:35:28,610
shit and light,
I liked it.

2159
01:35:29,300 --> 01:35:30,510
I would go.
I'd go buy it.

2160
01:35:30,850 --> 01:35:31,683
Like I,
if I,

2161
01:35:31,730 --> 01:35:33,630
if I downloaded it and it was trashed 
and vague,

2162
01:35:33,680 --> 01:35:36,630
I looked at it as like a taste test.
That's okay.

2163
01:35:36,850 --> 01:35:39,250
Maybe if more people adapted that things
would have.

2164
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:40,273
But again,
the record industry had plenty of 

2165
01:35:41,541 --> 01:35:43,800
opportunities to jump ahead of it.
And B,

2166
01:35:43,910 --> 01:35:44,743
they didn't.
There was technology out there already 

2167
01:35:45,771 --> 01:35:48,410
that people were dealing with bringing 
it so that I'm telling him and this wave

2168
01:35:48,411 --> 01:35:50,600
is coming.
So when the recommendation was making so

2169
01:35:50,601 --> 01:35:51,434
much money at that time,
if you look at the amount of money they 

2170
01:35:52,881 --> 01:35:53,714
were making off of the boy bands and the
Brittany Spears is enough that it was 

2171
01:35:56,571 --> 01:35:57,404
retarded how much money was in the 
record business and they let it all go 

2172
01:36:00,081 --> 01:36:00,914
down the drain because they thought they
had all the answers and they thought it 

2173
01:36:03,171 --> 01:36:04,040
had no money.

2174
01:36:04,280 --> 01:36:06,870
What could they have done to stop?
I'd have to go back.

2175
01:36:06,900 --> 01:36:07,733
I have some books on it.
Like there was taking out a lot street 

2176
01:36:10,260 --> 01:36:11,093
people.
There were people ready there to help 

2177
01:36:12,021 --> 01:36:15,120
set up things like master and how to 
monetize it and control it.

2178
01:36:15,121 --> 01:36:19,940
Like there was ways to deal with it.
There were ways to be part of it instead

2179
01:36:19,941 --> 01:36:20,774
of like wait till it was too late.
Will think about the movie industry too 

2180
01:36:23,201 --> 01:36:25,940
though,
is that people want to go to the movies.

2181
01:36:26,510 --> 01:36:30,230
Like the experience is not as good.
Apple Music saves the music industry.

2182
01:36:30,650 --> 01:36:32,090
Like apple.
If first items,

2183
01:36:32,150 --> 01:36:34,640
why didn't the recognition like there 
were people telling them,

2184
01:36:34,641 --> 01:36:36,350
this is coming and I didn't mean to 
interrupt you,

2185
01:36:36,351 --> 01:36:39,500
but I don't think they could have made 
the itunes first,

2186
01:36:39,620 --> 01:36:40,453
not called Itunes,
but like the industry itself should 

2187
01:36:42,730 --> 01:36:45,330
digitize and been ready,
right?

2188
01:36:45,390 --> 01:36:48,260
Would have been that simple.
Come up with their own version of itunes

2189
01:36:48,620 --> 01:36:52,670
and they could have invested a lot more 
money to music industry is booming,

2190
01:36:52,671 --> 01:36:53,504
but artists are losing big because most 
artists are signed to record deals with 

2191
01:36:56,361 --> 01:37:01,361
just 12 percent of revenue.
Twelve percent whoa.

2192
01:37:02,480 --> 01:37:03,313
Forty $3,000,000,000
a year was its most profitable year 

2193
01:37:05,691 --> 01:37:09,140
since 2006 listeners to spending more 
money than ever,

2194
01:37:09,560 --> 01:37:14,560
largely on streaming and live music with
consumer spending tow totaling more than

2195
01:37:14,841 --> 01:37:16,370
$20,000,000,000
last year.

2196
01:37:17,060 --> 01:37:17,893
Wow.
Yet artists aren't feeling the increase 

2197
01:37:19,011 --> 01:37:23,720
of the 20 billion music industry 
entities such as record labels took home

2198
01:37:23,750 --> 01:37:24,583
10 billion musicians taking home just 
five point 1 billion with the majority 

2199
01:37:28,071 --> 01:37:30,740
of the revenue coming from touring and 
concert sales.

2200
01:37:31,310 --> 01:37:32,143
It's amazing.
That's amazing that it's like a 

2201
01:37:33,651 --> 01:37:35,510
parasitic industry.
It's like you.

2202
01:37:35,660 --> 01:37:36,493
They don't.
People don't necessarily need them the 

2203
01:37:38,271 --> 01:37:39,050
way they used to.

2204
01:37:39,050 --> 01:37:40,460
No,
not they'd like they use to.

2205
01:37:40,520 --> 01:37:42,350
I was going to just play devil's 
advocate and say,

2206
01:37:42,351 --> 01:37:44,690
well,
it used to be that I'm the guy to put up

2207
01:37:44,691 --> 01:37:45,840
all the.
If I'm the label,

2208
01:37:45,850 --> 01:37:46,683
Oh,
I'm putting up millions of dollars in 

2209
01:37:47,451 --> 01:37:49,640
advanced gambling it on you right now.
When you.

2210
01:37:49,641 --> 01:37:51,830
When you want to take away my lion,
share it.

2211
01:37:51,860 --> 01:37:52,693
No,
fuck you.

2212
01:37:52,970 --> 01:37:56,100
Now it's totally different.
Now you can do this on your own.

2213
01:37:56,220 --> 01:37:57,060
Yeah.
You know what I mean?

2214
01:37:57,061 --> 01:37:59,460
You could start an instagram started 
youtube.

2215
01:37:59,461 --> 01:38:02,040
Start this and you can make beats on 
your laptop or like,

2216
01:38:03,090 --> 01:38:05,340
right.
Isn't that the guy who does everything?

2217
01:38:05,610 --> 01:38:08,040
Everything he's done is his own shit 
online.

2218
01:38:08,100 --> 01:38:09,000
Sure,
sure,

2219
01:38:09,150 --> 01:38:09,983
sure.
Yeah.

2220
01:38:10,150 --> 01:38:11,160
You don't believe it.
What do you mean?

2221
01:38:12,150 --> 01:38:12,983
Oh,
Jamie's got a conspiracy theory 

2222
01:38:13,890 --> 01:38:14,723
conspiracy,
but he's got more support than he would 

2223
01:38:16,261 --> 01:38:17,610
say.
Now he does.

2224
01:38:17,640 --> 01:38:18,580
Sure.
Yeah.

2225
01:38:18,610 --> 01:38:19,230
Now it does.

2226
01:38:19,230 --> 01:38:22,080
Maybe,
but I mean basically has become huge all

2227
01:38:22,081 --> 01:38:22,914
on his own.
Right.

2228
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:24,900
And you meet me,
you look,

2229
01:38:24,910 --> 01:38:28,530
it's like so many viral music hits,
you know,

2230
01:38:28,531 --> 01:38:29,364
they get,
they get big online just because kids 

2231
01:38:30,931 --> 01:38:33,690
share it and they like it.
Then then it becomes gigantic.

2232
01:38:34,020 --> 01:38:36,210
Like with the music industry that the 
industry,

2233
01:38:36,211 --> 01:38:38,310
the,
the labels have nothing to do with that,

2234
01:38:38,340 --> 01:38:39,360
right?
No.

2235
01:38:39,860 --> 01:38:40,693
There's labels that are doing their 
thing out there that they actually know 

2236
01:38:42,481 --> 01:38:44,190
what they're doing in marketing wise and
all that.

2237
01:38:44,220 --> 01:38:48,060
There's still a lot of kids that are 
being made famous by label.

2238
01:38:48,061 --> 01:38:50,200
So there's some benefit.
I mean there's a lot of these,

2239
01:38:50,460 --> 01:38:51,293
a lot of the reasons that some of these 
artists are only seeing five point one 

2240
01:38:52,921 --> 01:38:54,560
minutes because they're signed to record
deals.

2241
01:38:54,570 --> 01:38:56,640
You know,
Jay z ain't only seeing five,

2242
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,450
five percent of what he's due because 
he,

2243
01:38:59,510 --> 01:39:00,720
you know,
he's been in the game long enough,

2244
01:39:00,721 --> 01:39:01,554
you know,
and they started out with their own 

2245
01:39:02,221 --> 01:39:02,520
label.

2246
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:06,090
They started to beverly beginning 
Rockafella records was independent.

2247
01:39:06,360 --> 01:39:08,190
So that's the kind of,
you know,

2248
01:39:08,220 --> 01:39:10,930
those guys are never gonna lose as long 
as you know,

2249
01:39:11,640 --> 01:39:13,530
they can still make music that people 
buy.

2250
01:39:13,650 --> 01:39:14,483
Yeah.
They figure out a way to rope you in 

2251
01:39:15,781 --> 01:39:19,470
early to work,
like even if your record is successful,

2252
01:39:19,471 --> 01:39:21,990
the second record,
it's not like you're going to be able to

2253
01:39:21,991 --> 01:39:23,900
be independent on the second record.
They'll you,

2254
01:39:24,120 --> 01:39:25,950
they own you for several down the line.
Right?

2255
01:39:26,130 --> 01:39:27,390
Usually,
I mean it used to be.

2256
01:39:27,391 --> 01:39:31,190
I think the standard was like eight,
eight that.

2257
01:39:31,250 --> 01:39:32,460
But that's it.
That's,

2258
01:39:32,520 --> 01:39:33,170
it's,
it's,

2259
01:39:33,170 --> 01:39:35,280
it's misleading because it depends on 
where you're from too.

2260
01:39:35,281 --> 01:39:36,170
There's also like,
you know,

2261
01:39:36,171 --> 01:39:37,004
if your first record was very successful
and you have a lawyer that has anywhere 

2262
01:39:39,361 --> 01:39:41,760
with all your renegotiating before you 
do second record,

2263
01:39:41,761 --> 01:39:43,050
you know what I mean?
These are things you learn,

2264
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:46,830
but like if you're struggling that at 
eight record thing too.

2265
01:39:46,830 --> 01:39:47,663
Also if you study the record business,
it goes back to like when actually 

2266
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:54,060
artists used to be built that like over 
it.

2267
01:39:54,330 --> 01:39:56,580
Nobody expected the first album to do 
anything.

2268
01:39:56,581 --> 01:39:58,600
Like when you signed bands like in the 
sixties,

2269
01:39:58,601 --> 01:39:59,340
the bike,
you know,

2270
01:39:59,340 --> 01:40:01,530
they had a plan like my album three and 
four,

2271
01:40:01,531 --> 01:40:03,810
here's where we'll be used to build 
artists.

2272
01:40:03,811 --> 01:40:08,640
They used to be a and are they actually 
used to nurture and fucking take care of

2273
01:40:08,641 --> 01:40:10,560
a band for a long time and watch them 
grow?

2274
01:40:10,570 --> 01:40:13,050
What I mean,
that's the way it used to be until like,

2275
01:40:13,051 --> 01:40:14,580
you know,
whatever it was.

2276
01:40:14,581 --> 01:40:15,414
I maybe the eighties had changed.
I had a record deal for my comedy album 

2277
01:40:18,781 --> 01:40:19,614
in 1999.
I had a record deal with warner 

2278
01:40:21,031 --> 01:40:22,740
brothers.
It was like a real record deal,

2279
01:40:22,741 --> 01:40:24,880
like a met with them.
They,

2280
01:40:24,881 --> 01:40:28,370
they promoted it the whole deal.
I was like,

2281
01:40:28,380 --> 01:40:33,000
I went through the whole record industry
business and there was always a comedian

2282
01:40:33,001 --> 01:40:33,834
or two on labels,
so they don't have that anymore because 

2283
01:40:36,390 --> 01:40:38,460
comedy albums,
the do it yourself.

2284
01:40:38,670 --> 01:40:40,590
Well,
it's not just that you definitely can do

2285
01:40:40,591 --> 01:40:41,424
it yourself,
but comedy albums just aren't that 

2286
01:40:42,511 --> 01:40:44,780
popular anymore for some strange reason.
Well,

2287
01:40:44,860 --> 01:40:46,620
because it's,
it's,

2288
01:40:47,260 --> 01:40:48,093
it's a peer support.
Also the art form you want to watch it 

2289
01:40:50,340 --> 01:40:53,100
exam was about to say it's so.
It's so visual that now

2290
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:57,840
comedy albums were big when everybody 
didn't have a TV screen or everything is

2291
01:40:57,940 --> 01:40:59,480
like you could listen and imagine what 
we.

2292
01:40:59,481 --> 01:41:02,650
What he was doing or saying and 
translate super well,

2293
01:41:02,651 --> 01:41:06,220
like Mitch Hedberg translates amazing to
cd to,

2294
01:41:06,221 --> 01:41:08,410
to,
to just audio only because his,

2295
01:41:08,440 --> 01:41:12,070
he basically just stands there and tells
great jokes.

2296
01:41:12,370 --> 01:41:13,600
Like he doesn't have like,
there's,

2297
01:41:14,130 --> 01:41:16,570
it's fun to watch them,
more fun to watch him,

2298
01:41:16,571 --> 01:41:19,390
but once you know what he looks like and
how he does it,

2299
01:41:19,750 --> 01:41:21,940
it's kind of cool to listen to it on the
albums.

2300
01:41:23,410 --> 01:41:24,243
I was just talking about Steven right 
the other day to Steven Wright was a 

2301
01:41:26,921 --> 01:41:28,630
genius.
He was amazing.

2302
01:41:28,660 --> 01:41:29,510
Yeah.
But that,

2303
01:41:29,670 --> 01:41:31,770
that style is hard to do.
See what,

2304
01:41:31,830 --> 01:41:35,770
what Mitch Hedberg basically did was do 
that Steven Wright style,

2305
01:41:35,920 --> 01:41:36,753
but like a more stony drug style but,
but the drugs allowed him to come up 

2306
01:41:42,401 --> 01:41:43,780
with way more of those things.

2307
01:41:44,940 --> 01:41:49,420
Hedberg he just go on for days.
He had so much fucking material man.

2308
01:41:49,421 --> 01:41:53,410
That guy wrote constantly.
He was always writing until the end.

2309
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:55,210
In the end,
you know,

2310
01:41:55,211 --> 01:41:57,550
the drugs got to them.
Obviously they killed him.

2311
01:41:58,240 --> 01:42:00,620
But um,
he was uh,

2312
01:42:00,910 --> 01:42:01,743
his,
that's a,

2313
01:42:01,960 --> 01:42:05,380
that's a non sequitur style.
That's the hardest style of comedy.

2314
01:42:05,740 --> 01:42:06,573
You say one thing and then you say 
something totally unrelated to the next 

2315
01:42:09,400 --> 01:42:11,920
joke and the next joke.
Totally unrelated.

2316
01:42:12,280 --> 01:42:17,040
No sequencing or no man and you know,
it's all segues.

2317
01:42:17,050 --> 01:42:18,440
I'm sorry,
that wasn't a secret.

2318
01:42:18,460 --> 01:42:19,390
Yeah,
that's an outlet.

2319
01:42:19,400 --> 01:42:21,280
Sequency too.
It's like they don't.

2320
01:42:21,330 --> 01:42:23,410
They don't fit in together in any way,
way,

2321
01:42:23,411 --> 01:42:25,880
shape or form.
They're just total non sequitur.

2322
01:42:25,890 --> 01:42:26,890
It's just.
Here's a funny thing.

2323
01:42:26,891 --> 01:42:29,650
I thought of his,
another funny thing I thought of,

2324
01:42:30,100 --> 01:42:32,470
you know,
but his style is so unique.

2325
01:42:32,770 --> 01:42:35,170
Just the way he delivered things was so 
unique.

2326
01:42:35,650 --> 01:42:39,370
He was funny just talking about nothing 
like talking about anything.

2327
01:42:39,371 --> 01:42:40,820
One of my favorite jokes at his.
He goes,

2328
01:42:41,290 --> 01:42:42,123
he goes,
somebody asked me if I want a frozen 

2329
01:42:43,181 --> 01:42:44,410
banana.
I said,

2330
01:42:44,411 --> 01:42:47,140
no,
but I want a regular banana later.

2331
01:42:47,230 --> 01:42:52,230
So yes,
just silly joke,

2332
01:42:55,510 --> 01:42:59,140
but it's such a great job.
Oh Man.

2333
01:42:59,230 --> 01:43:01,810
All Day.
He's got like one of the best.

2334
01:43:01,870 --> 01:43:05,290
He's his albums with some of the best 
donor material of all time.

2335
01:43:05,291 --> 01:43:07,090
Maybe the best made me go listen to 
some.

2336
01:43:07,270 --> 01:43:08,650
Oh,
he was an incredible man,

2337
01:43:08,690 --> 01:43:09,523
so I'm familiar.
I just haven't listened to him or heard 

2338
01:43:11,141 --> 01:43:11,974
any of them throwing them on every now 
and again when I'm on my way to the 

2339
01:43:13,601 --> 01:43:14,434
airport,
I you still listened to on serious all 

2340
01:43:16,181 --> 01:43:18,610
the time,
the comedy channel than the dirtier,

2341
01:43:18,640 --> 01:43:22,060
darker one and he'd pop on there every 
once in a while.

2342
01:43:22,061 --> 01:43:22,910
Yeah,
yeah.

2343
01:43:23,670 --> 01:43:24,520
That.
Yeah.

2344
01:43:24,550 --> 01:43:27,050
I haven't had Sirius in forever.
Do you still?

2345
01:43:27,090 --> 01:43:29,190
It's used to listen to that now because 
I just,

2346
01:43:29,860 --> 01:43:30,970
yeah,
I just,

2347
01:43:30,971 --> 01:43:31,804
I don't really honestly,
my favorite thing in the car is silence 

2348
01:43:34,750 --> 01:43:37,180
really by myself.
Like I,

2349
01:43:37,400 --> 01:43:38,233
I get a lot of thinking done driving 
like it's or like if I'm ever really 

2350
01:43:42,101 --> 01:43:44,020
like stumped while I'm working on a 
song,

2351
01:43:44,110 --> 01:43:46,690
like because I don't write things down 
or anything.

2352
01:43:46,691 --> 01:43:51,130
Like just I'll get in the car and drive 
and then somehow it'll work itself out.

2353
01:43:51,530 --> 01:43:54,770
I can really just relax behind the 
wheel.

2354
01:43:54,890 --> 01:43:56,180
Yeah,
I know what you mean.

2355
01:43:56,210 --> 01:43:58,160
Unless I'm in the middle of like fucked 
up,

2356
01:43:58,750 --> 01:43:59,583
be like at night I can get in the car,
I could drive on an open road and it'll 

2357
01:44:02,601 --> 01:44:04,370
just.
It really relaxes me.

2358
01:44:04,430 --> 01:44:07,790
I have a car that it take to the comedy 
store all the time and it's a 1993.

2359
01:44:07,790 --> 01:44:10,910
Porsche doesn't have any radio,
no radio.

2360
01:44:11,060 --> 01:44:13,760
It's manual transmission,
no power steering,

2361
01:44:13,940 --> 01:44:15,820
no air conditioning.
It's just,

2362
01:44:16,130 --> 01:44:18,770
it's just an old car and everything,
like when,

2363
01:44:18,830 --> 01:44:22,730
when you drive it,
you feel every bump into you shifted.

2364
01:44:22,970 --> 01:44:23,803
But because of all that I have to think 
and it makes it fires my brain up 

2365
01:44:28,071 --> 01:44:29,480
because I'm doing all these different 
things,

2366
01:44:29,481 --> 01:44:31,130
hitting a clutch,
shifting the gears,

2367
01:44:31,460 --> 01:44:32,293
you know,
managing this heavy steering wheel and 

2368
01:44:34,371 --> 01:44:36,590
all that jazz.
And when I get to the store,

2369
01:44:36,591 --> 01:44:38,870
my brain is like charged up because of 
it.

2370
01:44:38,900 --> 01:44:40,460
It's like I've been doing a bunch of 
things.

2371
01:44:40,461 --> 01:44:43,820
It's exercise and your brain.
I'm not in the back seat,

2372
01:44:43,821 --> 01:44:45,230
sleeping,
you know,

2373
01:44:45,290 --> 01:44:47,600
waiting to get to the show.
And then I leave myself up.

2374
01:44:47,960 --> 01:44:50,750
I love to drive.
Do you still get that crazy audi?

2375
01:44:51,410 --> 01:44:52,310
No,
not right now.

2376
01:44:52,311 --> 01:44:54,200
I have a judge just bought a truck 
actually.

2377
01:44:54,200 --> 01:44:58,490
And I got a um,
a cls 63 s yeah.

2378
01:44:58,550 --> 01:45:01,490
It's nice that I just couldn't bring the
kids in the Audi,

2379
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:03,050
but I'm actually,
I miss it so much.

2380
01:45:03,051 --> 01:45:06,250
I'm actually about to get another one so
they have a new one and I know.

2381
01:45:07,930 --> 01:45:11,120
What do you think of a car?
I was like,

2382
01:45:11,121 --> 01:45:11,954
alright,
I gotta hit the road for about three 

2383
01:45:12,831 --> 01:45:14,150
months.
I'll be back with that car.

2384
01:45:14,810 --> 01:45:17,120
It's an amazing car.
Yeah,

2385
01:45:17,230 --> 01:45:18,063
it's a good time if you're into cars.
They got a lot of crazy ass fucking 

2386
01:45:20,811 --> 01:45:22,090
automobiles now.
Jack,

2387
01:45:22,280 --> 01:45:24,170
when I did have the rn man I would just 
like.

2388
01:45:24,200 --> 01:45:27,800
And then I lived much further south.
Actually lived off the 15,

2389
01:45:28,490 --> 01:45:32,540
like below the 91 and I would,
when I would shoot to sometimes it's not

2390
01:45:32,541 --> 01:45:35,300
the biggest for fights.
I would just show up in the Ra like on a

2391
01:45:35,301 --> 01:45:37,340
Thursday night,
like 11:00

2392
01:45:38,620 --> 01:45:41,120
I'll be there,
but to get there like three hours,

2393
01:45:41,180 --> 01:45:42,170
like Jesus.

2394
01:45:42,380 --> 01:45:43,213
I mean I was already on the 15.
I wasn't coming from deep la still 

2395
01:45:45,471 --> 01:45:46,830
Jesus,
but I do.

2396
01:45:46,870 --> 01:45:51,870
I do like a fucking book the whole way 
fast.

2397
01:45:54,530 --> 01:45:57,680
That's a four wheel drive car to that 
tech cars glued to the ground.

2398
01:45:57,681 --> 01:45:59,430
It's like on fucking rails,
man.

2399
01:45:59,450 --> 01:46:01,130
It's one of my favorite cars I've ever 
driven.

2400
01:46:01,340 --> 01:46:03,740
Yeah.
It's in the style,

2401
01:46:03,741 --> 01:46:04,574
like it's still relevant,
like they've kept that style basically 

2402
01:46:06,861 --> 01:46:10,760
with just a little few facelifts and 
improvements for a few years.

2403
01:46:10,761 --> 01:46:12,500
Essentially like a mini Lamborghini.
Right.

2404
01:46:12,501 --> 01:46:13,830
It's the same engine.
Yeah.

2405
01:46:13,831 --> 01:46:16,790
That's the Guy Yardo at the same engine 
as the guy who was a vet.

2406
01:46:16,791 --> 01:46:17,624
I mean it's more than enough power.
The crazy thing about today's cars are 

2407
01:46:20,330 --> 01:46:22,790
so they have so much power.
It's just ridiculous.

2408
01:46:22,791 --> 01:46:25,970
Like every year it's like a new faster 
zero to 60 time.

2409
01:46:26,420 --> 01:46:28,490
New Records on the nurburgring.
It's like,

2410
01:46:28,820 --> 01:46:30,620
what are you doing?
Like what are you taking this?

2411
01:46:30,621 --> 01:46:32,570
Like what are you going to drive this 
thing that fast,

2412
01:46:33,050 --> 01:46:33,883
you know,
just going to be teleporting the new 

2413
01:46:35,810 --> 01:46:36,643
corvette,
Zr one has 700 and something fucking 

2414
01:46:39,260 --> 01:46:41,040
horsepower.
How does the,

2415
01:46:41,160 --> 01:46:44,330
how does even stay on it?
Barely does that.

2416
01:46:44,360 --> 01:46:45,193
One of the drivers from GM,
one of like the head execs from gm took 

2417
01:46:47,871 --> 01:46:48,704
it on a race track like when they were 
first releasing it and crashed like 

2418
01:46:51,601 --> 01:46:54,120
immediately spun out and slammed into 
the fucking wall.

2419
01:46:58,790 --> 01:47:00,690
You got to know what the fuck you're 
doing.

2420
01:47:00,691 --> 01:47:01,524
If you're you're throttling.
I mean you have to be able to navigate 

2421
01:47:03,721 --> 01:47:04,554
that throttle with 700 horsepower 
because no matter what those wheels are 

2422
01:47:07,501 --> 01:47:08,334
spinning,
I'm going to how much especially rear 

2423
01:47:09,601 --> 01:47:10,434
wheel drive them and how much traction 
control do you have ever seen that 

2424
01:47:12,781 --> 01:47:13,920
video?
See?

2425
01:47:13,950 --> 01:47:14,783
Find the fucking hilarious.
It's a good video to watch to let you 

2426
01:47:18,601 --> 01:47:21,720
know like this is a crazy vehicle that 
you people are selling.

2427
01:47:21,950 --> 01:47:22,783
You're,
you're letting people get a car that is 

2428
01:47:24,571 --> 01:47:28,470
so much faster than anything that was on
the road five years ago.

2429
01:47:29,090 --> 01:47:29,923
I mean,
it's a fucking insane mobilian this 

2430
01:47:31,710 --> 01:47:35,400
speed limiting changed.
That car comes in handy.

2431
01:47:36,030 --> 01:47:37,580
Germany.
Yeah.

2432
01:47:37,850 --> 01:47:40,950
Yeah.
GM exec crashes.

2433
01:47:41,010 --> 01:47:44,860
New Corvette Z R one.
I mean he got.

2434
01:47:44,910 --> 01:47:49,910
This was before it was even released.
This dude showed everyone I got an extra

2435
01:47:50,251 --> 01:47:53,060
one you sent me.
That was funny.

2436
01:47:53,110 --> 01:47:56,310
I was talking about this guy,
but I liked a picture of his so long ago

2437
01:47:56,311 --> 01:47:57,210
and like,
here it is.

2438
01:47:57,211 --> 01:47:58,044
Look at this guy.

2439
01:48:00,570 --> 01:48:05,570
Play that again.
This play it from the beginning.

2440
01:48:06,350 --> 01:48:08,850
This knucklehead started to click.
I'll see if there's more angles on.

2441
01:48:08,880 --> 01:48:09,571
No,
no,

2442
01:48:09,571 --> 01:48:11,130
no.
Look at this right away.

2443
01:48:11,320 --> 01:48:12,570
This,
this guy.

2444
01:48:12,780 --> 01:48:13,980
Hey,
I know how to drive.

2445
01:48:13,981 --> 01:48:17,370
I'm a fucking executive.
Wow.

2446
01:48:17,490 --> 01:48:18,900
Yeah.
He's driving like an asshole.

2447
01:48:19,170 --> 01:48:21,280
He doesn't know how to drive.
Sorry sir.

2448
01:48:21,450 --> 01:48:24,660
Put the foot down and he doesn't know 
what the fuck he's doing.

2449
01:48:25,290 --> 01:48:27,170
Dumb ass.
Look that.

2450
01:48:27,171 --> 01:48:28,004
That's a car that you have to know how 
to navigate once the side one the asset 

2451
01:48:31,830 --> 01:48:34,320
kicks out to.
He was just stomping it.

2452
01:48:37,950 --> 01:48:38,783
Sure he got uh,
he felt like a nice amount of shit at 

2453
01:48:42,421 --> 01:48:43,254
the next board meeting.
We should look at that fucking car 

2454
01:48:45,991 --> 01:48:47,250
though.
Good Lord.

2455
01:48:47,251 --> 01:48:49,110
What a beast of.
What are they retailing for?

2456
01:48:49,610 --> 01:48:51,480
Oh,
it's more than a hundred.

2457
01:48:51,540 --> 01:48:53,940
I think it's like 150,
160,000

2458
01:48:54,250 --> 01:48:56,580
probably fully loaded,
but is a monster.

2459
01:48:56,800 --> 01:48:59,820
It looks like what they've done to the 
body stuff.

2460
01:48:59,910 --> 01:49:00,743
See,
but you know where your Ra has a huge 

2461
01:49:02,701 --> 01:49:03,534
advantage.
You're,

2462
01:49:03,630 --> 01:49:07,740
you're already as a four wheel drive car
and 755 horsepower.

2463
01:49:07,860 --> 01:49:11,650
Good Lord.
Good Lord saying Lord.

2464
01:49:12,090 --> 01:49:17,090
But the problem is it's hard to keep all
that power down on the,

2465
01:49:17,280 --> 01:49:20,700
on the ground with a rear wheel drive 
car.

2466
01:49:20,701 --> 01:49:23,730
You're just going to get a lot of 
sliding and if you know how to drive you

2467
01:49:23,731 --> 01:49:25,380
like that.
People who know how to drive,

2468
01:49:25,381 --> 01:49:27,760
they want to kick the ass end outside 
ways.

2469
01:49:28,320 --> 01:49:33,320
But like if you drive a like say a 
Nissan gtrs perfect example,

2470
01:49:33,630 --> 01:49:34,463
one of the best things about that car as
a regular person can drive it pretty 

2471
01:49:37,471 --> 01:49:38,304
fast because there's a lot of 
electronics and what they would call 

2472
01:49:40,990 --> 01:49:43,200
nanny controls and sort of keep 
everything in order.

2473
01:49:43,680 --> 01:49:45,690
So that car has been around for a long 
time.

2474
01:49:45,720 --> 01:49:48,490
They really haven't changed a whole lot 
about the way it looks.

2475
01:49:48,670 --> 01:49:49,503
They've,
but they've made these incremental 

2476
01:49:50,681 --> 01:49:51,514
improvements and performance and to this
day that is one of the cars you could 

2477
01:49:55,241 --> 01:49:57,460
drive.
That car is a mother fucker.

2478
01:49:57,461 --> 01:49:59,470
I rented one of those in Austin last 
year.

2479
01:49:59,770 --> 01:50:00,603
Holy Shit.
Was it fun to crazy to like does it 

2480
01:50:03,791 --> 01:50:06,970
defies logic?
It defies physics.

2481
01:50:07,030 --> 01:50:07,863
That's the NYSSMA one.
You don't want that one unless you want 

2482
01:50:10,331 --> 01:50:12,270
to take it to a track because that 
shit's harshest.

2483
01:50:12,271 --> 01:50:13,810
Fuck.
You just want the regular one.

2484
01:50:13,840 --> 01:50:18,840
The regular one is beastie enough?
They're amazing cars though.

2485
01:50:19,240 --> 01:50:21,000
All the pop up windows trying to get you
to buy it,

2486
01:50:21,300 --> 01:50:23,020
buy it,
buy it,

2487
01:50:23,140 --> 01:50:23,973
buy it,
buy it.

2488
01:50:24,340 --> 01:50:27,940
But really if I was going to get a brand
new Japanese car,

2489
01:50:28,420 --> 01:50:32,290
the real car to get now is the new NSX.
The new NSX.

2490
01:50:32,470 --> 01:50:33,730
Tj dillashaw has one.

2491
01:50:33,730 --> 01:50:36,220
He brought it in here and I was checking
it down outside.

2492
01:50:36,520 --> 01:50:37,353
Fuck man.
It's got electric engines on top of the 

2493
01:50:41,350 --> 01:50:43,120
regular engines.
It's a,

2494
01:50:43,150 --> 01:50:45,550
it's an amazing car.
Just fucking amazing.

2495
01:50:45,551 --> 01:50:47,380
And it's gorgeous.
Oh the accurate.

2496
01:50:47,381 --> 01:50:48,214
Okay.
And they have a 2019 one's coming out 

2497
01:50:50,291 --> 01:50:51,124
then as even more improvements,
but it's hard for them to sell these 

2498
01:50:54,101 --> 01:50:56,890
cars because like look at how good that 
looks.

2499
01:50:57,720 --> 01:50:58,690
Good.
That looks.

2500
01:50:59,380 --> 01:51:01,210
God,
they still kinda partial to the Audi.

2501
01:51:01,540 --> 01:51:03,080
Audi is a beast.
I love it.

2502
01:51:03,370 --> 01:51:05,320
Look,
it's just it's apples or oranges.

2503
01:51:05,350 --> 01:51:08,800
Just what you're into.
Tj has got that color to that blue bolt.

2504
01:51:08,801 --> 01:51:10,870
Pull up 2018 Audi R,
eight.

2505
01:51:12,080 --> 01:51:13,540
Nineteen.
Oh,

2506
01:51:13,630 --> 01:51:14,980
look at that.
Gorgeous.

2507
01:51:15,010 --> 01:51:15,843
Come on son.
You got to get silver too because it 

2508
01:51:18,311 --> 01:51:21,130
looks like a fucking spaceship.
That's a monster car.

2509
01:51:21,340 --> 01:51:24,130
Look how beautiful that is.
That's one of the best looking cars I've

2510
01:51:24,131 --> 01:51:25,360
ever seen.
A book.

2511
01:51:25,361 --> 01:51:26,890
Eighty two,
something like that.

2512
01:51:28,210 --> 01:51:30,220
Monster.
Monster vehicle.

2513
01:51:30,580 --> 01:51:32,680
Just ridiculous looking car.
Yeah,

2514
01:51:32,681 --> 01:51:34,490
and easy to drive to.
It's one of those cars.

2515
01:51:34,500 --> 01:51:37,360
Is this just a.
it's glued to the ground.

2516
01:51:37,361 --> 01:51:41,140
Four wheel drive,
electric power steer or electric engines

2517
01:51:41,141 --> 01:51:45,280
controlling the wheels.
Crazy brake system's amazing.

2518
01:51:45,610 --> 01:51:48,040
Fuck God dammit.
Look at that fucking thing.

2519
01:51:50,290 --> 01:51:52,030
Correct.
One hundred and 59.

2520
01:51:52,060 --> 01:51:54,810
Cheese Mo's.
That's a lot of Cheddar.

2521
01:51:55,040 --> 01:51:56,350
Chow.
Chow,

2522
01:51:58,600 --> 01:52:00,160
but it doesn't have the sound that your 
car had.

2523
01:52:00,850 --> 01:52:03,970
See the thing about the Audi is they 
have that big ass fucking v eight or the

2524
01:52:04,050 --> 01:52:05,330
[inaudible] depending on which one.
Again,

2525
01:52:05,380 --> 01:52:09,050
that'd be.
That's,

2526
01:52:10,100 --> 01:52:11,530
that's a different thing,
man.

2527
01:52:11,960 --> 01:52:13,510
It's a different thing.
What does that beast.

2528
01:52:14,280 --> 01:52:16,060
Oh,
what the fuck?

2529
01:52:16,490 --> 01:52:18,610
Two thousand 19.
Our eight Lms,

2530
01:52:18,730 --> 01:52:19,780
oh,
that's the race car.

2531
01:52:20,320 --> 01:52:23,830
That's a monster as gorgeous.
Pull up.

2532
01:52:23,860 --> 01:52:26,440
Two Thousand Nineteen Audi r eight.

2533
01:52:31,320 --> 01:52:32,153
People get mad.
We talked too much about cars but 

2534
01:52:33,141 --> 01:52:33,974
couldn't even afford to lose cars pro 
while you're talking about these cars 

2535
01:52:36,090 --> 01:52:38,400
say cause it's fun.
That's.

2536
01:52:38,850 --> 01:52:43,500
That must be the camouflage one actually
hurts or I saw on twitter someone posted

2537
01:52:43,501 --> 01:52:44,760
a picture.
They saw one like this.

2538
01:52:44,761 --> 01:52:47,240
Driving with like the squared paint job.
I've seen that.

2539
01:52:47,300 --> 01:52:47,961
Yeah.
Yeah.

2540
01:52:47,961 --> 01:52:48,794
They,
they drive them all over cities and 

2541
01:52:49,521 --> 01:52:51,530
everything like that to testament.
Yeah.

2542
01:52:51,531 --> 01:52:54,410
They do that for quite a long.
I've been around a few of those cars.

2543
01:52:55,130 --> 01:52:56,740
You ever see the one that they still do 
what?

2544
01:52:56,741 --> 01:52:58,190
With regular cars?
I remember when the.

2545
01:52:58,310 --> 01:53:00,290
Remember the PT Cruiser?
Yes.

2546
01:53:00,320 --> 01:53:02,450
When that was first by long before it 
came out,

2547
01:53:02,451 --> 01:53:03,284
like about a year before it came out.
They would like see this ugly fucking 

2548
01:53:05,541 --> 01:53:07,190
thing driving around with these 
magnetic,

2549
01:53:07,191 --> 01:53:09,890
like covers all over it.
So you couldn't see the car,

2550
01:53:09,891 --> 01:53:11,740
but you could totally tell what the 
shape was.

2551
01:53:11,780 --> 01:53:14,400
Right.
It was fucking hilarious.

2552
01:53:14,401 --> 01:53:16,070
Nobody gives a shit about that car 
anyway.

2553
01:53:16,080 --> 01:53:19,980
What they're going to steal your design?
No one's stealing the car.

2554
01:53:20,700 --> 01:53:22,160
And I drove one.
Once I had,

2555
01:53:22,240 --> 01:53:23,960
I rented one because it looked kind of 
cool.

2556
01:53:23,961 --> 01:53:24,980
I said,
I'll take one of those.

2557
01:53:24,981 --> 01:53:28,700
That's kind of cool looking all my God,
what a death trap I was driving.

2558
01:53:28,701 --> 01:53:30,350
I was like,
this thing has zero control,

2559
01:53:30,351 --> 01:53:32,560
like you can't corner in it.
The break suck.

2560
01:53:32,930 --> 01:53:35,840
Just looked like an old surfer car.
Way Worse.

2561
01:53:36,050 --> 01:53:38,690
I've rented a Hummer h three once.
I wouldn't,

2562
01:53:38,691 --> 01:53:40,850
never even.
Oh good Lord.

2563
01:53:40,990 --> 01:53:42,860
And I took it on a dirt road.
I was in,

2564
01:53:42,861 --> 01:53:43,940
uh,
in Colorado.

2565
01:53:43,941 --> 01:53:45,190
We drove up this hill,
that Dura,

2566
01:53:45,470 --> 01:53:46,860
like every time I was going around a 
corner,

2567
01:53:46,861 --> 01:53:50,720
it was kicking out sideways and then 
things like zero traction was a terrible

2568
01:53:50,721 --> 01:53:52,310
car prowler.
Oh,

2569
01:53:52,311 --> 01:53:54,950
never.
Interesting.

2570
01:53:54,980 --> 01:53:55,813
Cyber chip foose design.
That same guy who built my barracuda or 

2571
01:53:59,121 --> 01:54:00,800
designed by Barracuda,
not built it.

2572
01:54:02,150 --> 01:54:03,340
Yeah.
No,

2573
01:54:03,400 --> 01:54:04,340
thanks.
Yeah.

2574
01:54:04,380 --> 01:54:06,650
Disgusting.
That was like the hot wheel you hated.

2575
01:54:10,980 --> 01:54:11,720
Right?
You're like,

2576
01:54:11,720 --> 01:54:12,800
get this one out of here,
man.

2577
01:54:12,880 --> 01:54:14,910
The hot wheel.
You put a firecracker and yeah,

2578
01:54:14,990 --> 01:54:17,180
give me that old corvette.
Fuck this little thing.

2579
01:54:18,600 --> 01:54:19,580
Yeah,
they tried those.

2580
01:54:19,610 --> 01:54:23,960
They tried those for awhile.
Know it's an interesting time for cars.

2581
01:54:23,961 --> 01:54:24,794
Doe down.
They mean and people are starting to go 

2582
01:54:26,781 --> 01:54:29,150
towards electric cars.
Have you driven a tesla yet?

2583
01:54:29,330 --> 01:54:31,310
No.
That's a goddamn space machine.

2584
01:54:31,760 --> 01:54:34,520
Those things are rocket ships are so 
fast.

2585
01:54:34,521 --> 01:54:37,280
They don't even make any sense.
They don't make any sense.

2586
01:54:37,490 --> 01:54:40,520
There's zero to 60 in two seconds.
That's crazy.

2587
01:54:40,580 --> 01:54:41,630
There are so fat.
There's.

2588
01:54:41,720 --> 01:54:43,820
There's no,
there's no gears.

2589
01:54:44,240 --> 01:54:45,350
Right?
Because there's no trends.

2590
01:54:45,440 --> 01:54:47,350
The transmission is not the same because
there's no,

2591
01:54:47,351 --> 01:54:50,660
it's not a combustion engine has to feed
in the transmission,

2592
01:54:50,900 --> 01:54:51,733
the clutch and all that stuff.
Kind of like when you just let roadster 

2593
01:54:53,960 --> 01:54:56,690
press forward on the remote control 
cars.

2594
01:54:56,690 --> 01:54:58,340
Right,
exactly.

2595
01:54:58,410 --> 01:55:00,050
Just to make sense.
Yeah.

2596
01:55:00,140 --> 01:55:04,430
Just electric car.
That goes one point nine second son zero

2597
01:55:04,431 --> 01:55:05,840
to 60.
What?

2598
01:55:05,841 --> 01:55:10,841
In the actual fuck and it can go 620 
miles before you have to charge it.

2599
01:55:12,230 --> 01:55:15,230
That's crazy.
That's going to be a monster.

2600
01:55:15,780 --> 01:55:16,360
Yeah,
and long.

2601
01:55:16,360 --> 01:55:19,160
You got to wait to get one.
Hey,

2602
01:55:19,161 --> 01:55:20,570
maybe you got a word in which your 
buddy.

2603
01:55:21,230 --> 01:55:22,490
Yeah,
I was not ready yet.

2604
01:55:22,491 --> 01:55:24,590
It's 2020.
They're going to start selling them.

2605
01:55:24,591 --> 01:55:27,080
I don't even think they've.
They've not even in production.

2606
01:55:27,560 --> 01:55:29,240
Meanwhile he's shot.
Went off into space.

2607
01:55:29,270 --> 01:55:31,400
Look how pretty it is though.
God,

2608
01:55:31,401 --> 01:55:33,770
when I think comes out.
That's a gorgeous car.

2609
01:55:33,920 --> 01:55:35,480
That's a CGI though,
right?

2610
01:55:35,840 --> 01:55:36,673
No,
no,

2611
01:55:37,100 --> 01:55:40,280
because remember they had one.
They shot into space.

2612
01:55:40,340 --> 01:55:42,080
Look at that.
Look how fast that fucking thing goes.

2613
01:55:43,290 --> 01:55:47,040
One point nine seconds.
Two hundred 50 plus miles per hour.

2614
01:55:48,730 --> 01:55:50,470
I mean,
what the fuck?

2615
01:55:50,500 --> 01:55:52,570
That's going to be one of the most 
amazing cars ever.

2616
01:55:52,571 --> 01:55:55,830
Once it actually comes out.
That's kind of cool.

2617
01:55:55,850 --> 01:55:57,690
Save up your Cheddar.
200 gs.

2618
01:55:59,170 --> 01:56:00,490
Two 50.
Fully loaded.

2619
01:56:00,590 --> 01:56:02,560
Whoa.
It's just a quarter brick doc.

2620
01:56:02,561 --> 01:56:06,130
I said founders series reservation.
What does that mean?

2621
01:56:07,040 --> 01:56:07,930
Cool.
Awesome.

2622
01:56:08,980 --> 01:56:09,813
Yeah.
That guy was a weird guy to talk to 

2623
01:56:12,010 --> 01:56:12,843
because I couldn't get over all the 
stuff he does like how do you do all 

2624
01:56:15,131 --> 01:56:15,964
these different things?
How do you make these and then you make 

2625
01:56:19,060 --> 01:56:19,893
roof panels and then you like drilling 
tunnels and then you shoot and rockets 

2626
01:56:23,861 --> 01:56:25,240
into space.
Space X.

2627
01:56:25,290 --> 01:56:26,123
Yeah,
he's doing everything he alien said he 

2628
01:56:29,591 --> 01:56:31,210
was.
Maybe we should listen,

2629
01:56:32,330 --> 01:56:34,060
said he was an alien.
He might be.

2630
01:56:35,950 --> 01:56:37,810
Might be a higher thinking life.
Well,

2631
01:56:37,820 --> 01:56:41,490
he might as well be right if he was an 
alien and he looked exactly like that.

2632
01:56:41,500 --> 01:56:42,333
I'll be honest,
when he grabbed the joint in the way he 

2633
01:56:43,691 --> 01:56:45,240
kind of looked at it,
I was kinda like,

2634
01:56:45,241 --> 01:56:47,380
it seemed kind of like a guy who was 
kind of like,

2635
01:56:47,660 --> 01:56:49,960
we're not familiar with this practice,
but.

2636
01:56:50,140 --> 01:56:54,580
Or maybe he's so smart that he thought 
it would be funny if you print attended.

2637
01:56:54,581 --> 01:56:57,190
He didn't know what a joint was.
Could be.

2638
01:56:57,580 --> 01:56:59,110
I don't think he didn't know what it 
was.

2639
01:56:59,111 --> 01:57:01,030
I'm just saying as he was about to 
partake,

2640
01:57:01,031 --> 01:57:03,190
he kind of had this real inquisitive 
lake.

2641
01:57:03,670 --> 01:57:04,420
Yeah.
But there was a part.

2642
01:57:04,420 --> 01:57:07,480
It was a blunt and he almost seemed like
he didn't know what a blunt was.

2643
01:57:08,080 --> 01:57:08,913
Like you've never been a believer that I
can believe that the glass tip could 

2644
01:57:11,831 --> 01:57:13,480
have thrown them off because that's a 
little unique.

2645
01:57:13,481 --> 01:57:14,950
If you're not.
If you're not familiar.

2646
01:57:15,010 --> 01:57:17,080
Not Everybody is hip to weed culture,
man,

2647
01:57:17,200 --> 01:57:18,700
as we think.
You know what I mean?

2648
01:57:19,630 --> 01:57:20,463
Right.
But when he said that Tesla is going 

2649
01:57:22,661 --> 01:57:25,410
private funding secure at 4:20,

2650
01:57:27,770 --> 01:57:30,610
which is $20,000,000
for that joke,

2651
01:57:30,790 --> 01:57:33,670
that joke cost them $20,000,000
to sec got mad at him.

2652
01:57:33,671 --> 01:57:38,440
They find him.
It was also your stock price is a little

2653
01:57:38,441 --> 01:57:39,274
bit.
Well that was one of the things in your 

2654
01:57:40,391 --> 01:57:43,750
shareholders into a panic.
Jamie was concerned that they were going

2655
01:57:43,751 --> 01:57:48,520
to contact us and see if we arranged 
that pot smoking part.

2656
01:57:48,940 --> 01:57:49,773
Like if that was something that had been
arranged in advance because it crashed 

2657
01:57:52,001 --> 01:57:54,830
the stock stories.
That was.

2658
01:57:55,120 --> 01:57:58,970
I was like Joe Rogan making noise out 
here.

2659
01:57:59,700 --> 01:58:00,820
Jesus.
We didn't do that.

2660
01:58:00,821 --> 01:58:02,980
Did.
We definitely didn't.

2661
01:58:03,610 --> 01:58:05,110
Yeah.
That was organic folks.

2662
01:58:05,140 --> 01:58:08,050
It was amazing.
It was amazing.

2663
01:58:08,200 --> 01:58:12,460
Strange.
That's what this podcast is for.

2664
01:58:12,700 --> 01:58:13,740
Yeah.
For strange shit.

2665
01:58:14,720 --> 01:58:16,600
Strange moments that you can't get on 
NBC.

2666
01:58:19,660 --> 01:58:22,380
Well you can't even get it on Netflix.
You know what I mean?

2667
01:58:22,430 --> 01:58:26,770
A liquid norm.
Macdonald's show on Netflix like he's a.

2668
01:58:26,920 --> 01:58:27,753
he's got that thing that he's doing with
Netflix is probably the most 

2669
01:58:30,371 --> 01:58:34,570
unrestricted of all networks of all 
things you trying to do.

2670
01:58:34,660 --> 01:58:35,493
And in terms of comedy,
there's nothing ever been like it's the 

2671
01:58:37,691 --> 01:58:38,524
greatest thing.
Netflix for sure is the greatest thing 

2672
01:58:40,151 --> 01:58:42,730
that's ever happened to up comedy ever.
I can see that.

2673
01:58:42,880 --> 01:58:46,960
Never been accompanied special.
You want to give you no feedback.

2674
01:58:46,990 --> 01:58:48,040
They don't.
They don't give you.

2675
01:58:48,070 --> 01:58:49,990
They don't fuck with you at all.
They don't.

2676
01:58:49,991 --> 01:58:52,630
They don't censor you.
They don't tell you what to do.

2677
01:58:52,810 --> 01:58:53,980
They don't me.
They have.

2678
01:58:54,010 --> 01:58:57,070
Some people have said some things that 
they wanted to edit out.

2679
01:58:57,430 --> 01:58:58,263
What's a number has to be like way,
way across the line for the Joe Rogan 

2680
01:59:05,411 --> 01:59:06,244
numbers are they?

2681
01:59:06,430 --> 01:59:07,950
That's when they come to you and they 
said,

2682
01:59:07,951 --> 01:59:09,280
here's your special.
We're going to do this.

2683
01:59:09,290 --> 01:59:10,990
But they know what they are doing.
They don't.

2684
01:59:11,060 --> 01:59:12,910
They know who you are,
what you do.

2685
01:59:13,540 --> 01:59:15,460
They know their sign on what you are 
doing,

2686
01:59:15,470 --> 01:59:16,303
your special with you because they know 
how many eyes you're going to bring to 

2687
01:59:19,451 --> 01:59:20,710
the channel.
Yeah.

2688
01:59:20,711 --> 01:59:21,544
They know what they're doing,
but it's still just having this ability 

2689
01:59:23,591 --> 01:59:25,600
to have something streaming.
I was like,

2690
01:59:25,601 --> 01:59:27,560
there's never been like if you,
if you,

2691
01:59:27,570 --> 01:59:28,960
if you are a person who said,
oh,

2692
01:59:28,961 --> 01:59:33,850
I want to do a show on this network,
forget about Netflix.

2693
01:59:33,851 --> 01:59:35,590
Like if you just decided,
that's almost like,

2694
01:59:36,160 --> 01:59:39,280
I don't want people to watch this.
I want people to watch it one time.

2695
01:59:39,580 --> 01:59:41,800
We want it to be on 10 PM,
Saturday,

2696
01:59:41,801 --> 01:59:44,160
October 17th and that's it.
Like,

2697
01:59:44,190 --> 01:59:45,460
cool out.
Fuck wants that.

2698
01:59:46,300 --> 01:59:47,133
Nobody wants to.
You want someone to be at the airport 

2699
01:59:49,720 --> 01:59:54,370
with their phone and be and I want to go
to Chris rock special.

2700
01:59:54,400 --> 01:59:55,910
Let me check it out right now.
Bam.

2701
01:59:55,911 --> 01:59:56,744
Amazing.
And then you're sitting there on your 

2702
01:59:57,971 --> 01:59:58,990
own just watching it.

2703
02:00:00,950 --> 02:00:01,783
The only.
There is no live TV and all that's gone 

2704
02:00:04,800 --> 02:00:06,330
the wayside.
It's useless.

2705
02:00:06,360 --> 02:00:07,193
It's,
I see commercials now I start laughing 

2706
02:00:08,880 --> 02:00:10,050
like,
ha ha,

2707
02:00:10,440 --> 02:00:11,273
you fucking dinosaurs.
Which your bullshit ass commercials and 

2708
02:00:13,980 --> 02:00:17,130
I just finished ozark.
Did you finish it the second season?

2709
02:00:17,131 --> 02:00:18,540
Don't say anything.
Don't say anything.

2710
02:00:18,541 --> 02:00:21,620
I'm still starting the second season.
I'm on second episode.

2711
02:00:21,650 --> 02:00:25,000
It's so good on the episode where they 
just the the,

2712
02:00:25,070 --> 02:00:27,680
where the hand guy blew the hand 
earlier.

2713
02:00:28,100 --> 02:00:30,700
Don't you should spoiler alert that sir.
What?

2714
02:00:30,930 --> 02:00:35,430
Nobody knows why when or don't people 
out there?

2715
02:00:35,640 --> 02:00:39,000
I'm just saying Netflix is killing it.
Stranger things.

2716
02:00:40,510 --> 02:00:41,590
You ever watch that show?
No,

2717
02:00:41,600 --> 02:00:44,740
I'm playing for the next season.
Goddamn Netflix.

2718
02:00:44,741 --> 02:00:46,900
Here's what Netflix is for.
Like for me and my wife.

2719
02:00:46,930 --> 02:00:49,270
That's like one of our things.
We find a show.

2720
02:00:49,360 --> 02:00:50,810
Yeah.
So spend some time together.

2721
02:00:50,840 --> 02:00:52,150
It's too.
Yeah.

2722
02:00:52,690 --> 02:00:53,950
She found like,
you know what I mean?

2723
02:00:53,951 --> 02:00:56,260
Stranger things I think I found.
But yeah,

2724
02:00:56,261 --> 02:00:56,690
we,
that's,

2725
02:00:56,690 --> 02:00:57,550
that's our thing.
Like,

2726
02:00:57,551 --> 02:00:58,384
well like Ozark has been kind of tough 
for us because we watched the first 

2727
02:01:01,451 --> 02:01:02,284
episode of season two and then I went on
tour for a month so we just watched the 

2728
02:01:06,251 --> 02:01:10,660
second one and I got to leave now.
So it's like.

2729
02:01:10,750 --> 02:01:11,583
And we can't,
we don't have time to binge the whole 

2730
02:01:12,401 --> 02:01:13,234
thing.
So is there any other good ones that I 

2731
02:01:14,171 --> 02:01:15,004
need to know about?
People occasionally tweet me once and I 

2732
02:01:16,691 --> 02:01:17,524
forget.
There's a weird German one called I 

2733
02:01:19,541 --> 02:01:20,950
think dark.
I mean it's,

2734
02:01:21,180 --> 02:01:22,590
it's,
it's subtitled,

2735
02:01:22,600 --> 02:01:25,030
this stuff,
but it's crazy black mirror.

2736
02:01:25,030 --> 02:01:26,170
Of course you.
Yeah,

2737
02:01:26,200 --> 02:01:30,250
black men watched the show though shit.
But that is a weird one.

2738
02:01:30,550 --> 02:01:32,410
That's one of those ones that I watch.
Look,

2739
02:01:32,411 --> 02:01:33,244
I'm stone.
I come home from the comedy store and 

2740
02:01:34,451 --> 02:01:36,650
I'm smoking a little weed and I'll watch
that and I'm like,

2741
02:01:36,720 --> 02:01:40,040
why am I watching someone that you were 
about the one,

2742
02:01:40,041 --> 02:01:42,500
the star trekking one and that's what 
made me go look at it.

2743
02:01:42,501 --> 02:01:43,334
And I was like,
let me go look at it again because I 

2744
02:01:44,481 --> 02:01:45,314
think I watched it in the beginning.
I think I tried early on and it was the 

2745
02:01:47,541 --> 02:01:50,230
one where the politician had the fuck 
fuck the DA.

2746
02:01:50,330 --> 02:01:51,163
Yeah.
So,

2747
02:01:51,230 --> 02:01:52,510
and that kind of just seems like all 
right,

2748
02:01:52,630 --> 02:01:53,510
sorry,
whatever.

2749
02:01:53,511 --> 02:01:57,040
This weird shit.
And I probably just wasn't as good.

2750
02:01:57,110 --> 02:01:58,940
I don't want to.
But then when you told me about that,

2751
02:01:58,941 --> 02:01:59,774
when I went back,
started there and that was the last 

2752
02:02:00,920 --> 02:02:01,753
season and I worked my way back and 
actually got to that one again and 

2753
02:02:03,321 --> 02:02:05,480
rewatched it and I was like,
oh these are all pretty crazy.

2754
02:02:05,480 --> 02:02:07,220
Did you see heavy metal?
You see that one?

2755
02:02:08,120 --> 02:02:10,340
That's the one with the drones.
The drones coming after people.

2756
02:02:10,400 --> 02:02:11,233
Oh yeah,
yeah.

2757
02:02:11,360 --> 02:02:12,380
Well,
yeah.

2758
02:02:12,710 --> 02:02:16,580
Well that's too close to home.
I binge watched black mirror.

2759
02:02:17,030 --> 02:02:19,460
Pretty tough over just two or three day 
period.

2760
02:02:19,461 --> 02:02:22,820
And like for like a couple of weeks I 
was convinced I'm living in a simulation

2761
02:02:22,821 --> 02:02:23,654
like after watching,
especially the dating ones where they 

2762
02:02:26,561 --> 02:02:29,630
just keep me.
Just blew my mind a little bit.

2763
02:02:30,110 --> 02:02:32,180
That was another thing that Ilan must 
freaked me out about.

2764
02:02:32,810 --> 02:02:35,390
He was saying it's quite possible that 
we are living in a simulation.

2765
02:02:35,391 --> 02:02:36,130
Oh Dude,
I,

2766
02:02:36,130 --> 02:02:39,950
I'm always playing with that idea.
Like is it like you posted something the

2767
02:02:39,951 --> 02:02:41,510
other day that was like someone.
Oh,

2768
02:02:41,511 --> 02:02:44,180
what was the trump thing with?
Was that a real t shirt by the way?

2769
02:02:44,240 --> 02:02:44,751
It's a,
well,

2770
02:02:44,751 --> 02:02:48,440
it's a real teacher that you can buy,
but it's not from Donald trump store.

2771
02:02:48,440 --> 02:02:52,040
It's a company that sell them.
It's like trump store.shop.

2772
02:02:52,170 --> 02:02:53,080
Uh,
yeah.

2773
02:02:53,081 --> 02:02:55,600
So we're living in a movie.
I was like,

2774
02:02:55,610 --> 02:02:58,320
yeah,
the sick.

2775
02:03:00,250 --> 02:03:02,240
That's fake news.
It's not fake news.

2776
02:03:02,241 --> 02:03:04,160
It's a real short.
I know it's not his,

2777
02:03:04,370 --> 02:03:06,770
but eat the fact that that's a shirt.
It says,

2778
02:03:06,771 --> 02:03:07,604
I like beer and it has a guy who's run 
did trying to put this guy in the 

2779
02:03:11,031 --> 02:03:13,760
supreme court.
It's fucking hilarious.

2780
02:03:14,180 --> 02:03:16,850
The whole world is hilarious.
Hilarious.

2781
02:03:16,910 --> 02:03:18,400
All fucked up.
Yeah,

2782
02:03:18,710 --> 02:03:19,543
but this is one of the cool things about
black mirror is like black mirror 

2783
02:03:21,170 --> 02:03:26,170
showing you like where some things could
go in a total dystopian way.

2784
02:03:27,651 --> 02:03:30,230
Like where do you see crocodile that 
episode?

2785
02:03:31,010 --> 02:03:34,550
Crocodile is the one way you can.
We.

2786
02:03:34,551 --> 02:03:38,330
You can record memories and they did all
of them.

2787
02:03:38,331 --> 02:03:40,280
I just don't know the title.
Remember this lady.

2788
02:03:40,850 --> 02:03:42,280
Remember this lady with the car 
accident,

2789
02:03:42,300 --> 02:03:44,120
the beginning and insurance company.

2790
02:03:44,300 --> 02:03:46,160
Remember this,
remember this.

2791
02:03:46,550 --> 02:03:50,750
This was the darkest of the dark ones.
That one was so fucked up.

2792
02:03:51,410 --> 02:03:53,150
That one wrecked me.
Oh,

2793
02:03:53,151 --> 02:03:53,984
that was the one where the people could 
a rewind each of those memories in 

2794
02:03:57,081 --> 02:03:58,330
playback.
Yeah.

2795
02:03:58,850 --> 02:04:01,340
Yeah.
Which is all that is coming.

2796
02:04:01,580 --> 02:04:02,760
Oh,
that's easily call.

2797
02:04:02,761 --> 02:04:04,450
This shit is coming.
Then there's the one where it was.

2798
02:04:04,460 --> 02:04:07,160
It wasn't super dark,
but it was where the chick was trying to

2799
02:04:07,161 --> 02:04:09,180
up her status in the world.
Yes.

2800
02:04:09,530 --> 02:04:12,440
Stars up the Star Trek.
One's my favorite.

2801
02:04:12,441 --> 02:04:15,350
I think that one was fucking amazing.
Is it going?

2802
02:04:15,540 --> 02:04:16,373
It was amazing and it's just in that is 
this sort of weird blend of current 

2803
02:04:21,711 --> 02:04:22,544
reality.
One a possibility of where it was the 

2804
02:04:24,381 --> 02:04:26,810
chicken session and like she doesn't 
know where she is,

2805
02:04:26,811 --> 02:04:27,591
who she is,
whatever.

2806
02:04:27,591 --> 02:04:32,020
And everybody's recording the murderer.
That was a crazy one too,

2807
02:04:32,030 --> 02:04:33,860
man.
It's fucking amazing show.

2808
02:04:34,840 --> 02:04:37,680
Yeah.
I only do it if you hadn't mentioned the

2809
02:04:37,681 --> 02:04:38,160
Star Trek

2810
02:04:38,160 --> 02:04:39,740
when I probably never would have 
revisited that.

2811
02:04:39,750 --> 02:04:42,300
So good.
There's so many good shows.

2812
02:04:42,301 --> 02:04:44,010
Now.
What else is good?

2813
02:04:44,130 --> 02:04:46,020
What else I need to know about anything 
you've seen it.

2814
02:04:46,021 --> 02:04:47,050
It's not a show.
It's a,

2815
02:04:47,051 --> 02:04:49,890
I think a documentary ish.
It's like Kinda like half documentary.

2816
02:04:49,891 --> 02:04:51,740
And then they did some like 
recreation's.

2817
02:04:51,741 --> 02:04:53,790
Um,
it's called wormwood now.

2818
02:04:53,850 --> 02:04:55,080
It's all about the,
uh,

2819
02:04:55,230 --> 02:04:57,980
the uh,
the acid CIA,

2820
02:04:58,770 --> 02:05:01,860
mk ultra program and shot a Netflix.
It's on Netflix.

2821
02:05:01,861 --> 02:05:02,580
Yes.
Wormwood.

2822
02:05:02,580 --> 02:05:03,630
Oh,
you got to check it.

2823
02:05:03,631 --> 02:05:05,370
It's still.
You don't want my favorite one.

2824
02:05:05,371 --> 02:05:06,204
They did.
Do you know what operation midnight 

2825
02:05:07,171 --> 02:05:12,171
climax as it sounds.
They ran a brothel and they gave.

2826
02:05:13,290 --> 02:05:14,123
They gave John's.
The guys would come to the fuckery and 

2827
02:05:16,171 --> 02:05:16,771
they would,
uh,

2828
02:05:16,771 --> 02:05:19,230
they would give them acid to run tests 
on.

2829
02:05:19,240 --> 02:05:21,660
They loved,
give people acid back in the fifties.

2830
02:05:21,661 --> 02:05:23,760
They didn't know what it's called.

2831
02:05:23,760 --> 02:05:25,500
Wormwood.
Wormwood.

2832
02:05:25,501 --> 02:05:27,870
Yeah.
It's really good.

2833
02:05:27,871 --> 02:05:29,490
Man.
Has like a really good actor,

2834
02:05:29,491 --> 02:05:31,200
like doing the,
playing the main role.

2835
02:05:31,201 --> 02:05:33,390
Like when they do the recreation's,
you'll recognize him.

2836
02:05:33,391 --> 02:05:34,820
I forget his name,
but he's been in that time.

2837
02:05:35,100 --> 02:05:40,100
He was in that movie.
The other marines were with a guild hall

2838
02:05:42,400 --> 02:05:45,090
where they were in Iraq.
He was as part of our head,

2839
02:05:45,150 --> 02:05:47,870
no jar jar.
Head partner in jarhead.

2840
02:05:47,880 --> 02:05:49,470
He was that guy.
He's in a lot of stuff.

2841
02:05:49,471 --> 02:05:50,910
I can't remember his name.
He's a really good actor though.

2842
02:05:51,570 --> 02:05:54,450
This is just almost too much good shit 
to watch today.

2843
02:05:54,480 --> 02:05:55,313
Oh yeah.
Another one I watched because he was 

2844
02:05:56,911 --> 02:05:57,301
the,
the,

2845
02:05:57,301 --> 02:05:57,891
the,
the,

2846
02:05:57,891 --> 02:06:01,410
the documentary a wild.
Uh Oh wow.

2847
02:06:01,411 --> 02:06:02,550
Wow.
Wild country.

2848
02:06:03,840 --> 02:06:04,673
And then it all started coming back.
Like I remember that news when we were 

2849
02:06:06,660 --> 02:06:07,590
like,
when I was young,

2850
02:06:07,790 --> 02:06:09,540
this game for that at all,
it started being like,

2851
02:06:09,541 --> 02:06:11,010
oh man,
I kind of remember this.

2852
02:06:11,310 --> 02:06:12,143
You don't really know what.
I just watched three identical 

2853
02:06:14,371 --> 02:06:16,970
strangers.
Oh Dude.

2854
02:06:16,980 --> 02:06:18,540
About the triplets to.
Oh Dude,

2855
02:06:18,541 --> 02:06:20,000
I can't even,
I'm not going to spoiler it,

2856
02:06:20,050 --> 02:06:22,170
go watch that.
Some netflix thing to it.

2857
02:06:22,171 --> 02:06:23,890
It's,
it's a big site.

2858
02:06:23,930 --> 02:06:24,763
Got It on.
I rented it on Itunes for like five 

2859
02:06:26,041 --> 02:06:27,740
bucks.
Three identical strangers.

2860
02:06:27,840 --> 02:06:29,160
It might not be on Netflix.
No,

2861
02:06:29,161 --> 02:06:29,461
no,
no.

2862
02:06:29,461 --> 02:06:32,910
But it's basically some triplets that 
were separated at birth.

2863
02:06:33,630 --> 02:06:34,770
And,
and um,

2864
02:06:34,980 --> 02:06:39,980
did I say birth?
Birth at birth and uh,

2865
02:06:42,250 --> 02:06:43,440
the store that.
I mean,

2866
02:06:43,441 --> 02:06:46,890
and that's,
that's the first 20 minutes is amazing.

2867
02:06:46,980 --> 02:06:48,840
After that it gets crazy.
Like,

2868
02:06:48,841 --> 02:06:50,280
and dark.
Really?

2869
02:06:50,340 --> 02:06:51,900
Yeah.
Okay.

2870
02:06:52,280 --> 02:06:54,930
Let's come back onto.
Oh yeah,

2871
02:06:54,940 --> 02:06:56,610
making a murderer.
Is that so,

2872
02:06:56,611 --> 02:06:58,380
is that Netflix three identical 
strangers?

2873
02:06:58,560 --> 02:06:59,940
It didn't say.
It says a documentary.

2874
02:06:59,941 --> 02:07:01,570
I don't know if it could be.
Well,

2875
02:07:01,571 --> 02:07:03,930
wild wild country is just God damn 
amazing.

2876
02:07:03,970 --> 02:07:06,900
It was a cnn film so it could be on 
Netflix too,

2877
02:07:07,220 --> 02:07:09,630
but right now it's on itunes and you 
have to run it.

2878
02:07:09,631 --> 02:07:11,460
So I don't think I found it on Netflix.
You know,

2879
02:07:11,461 --> 02:07:12,294
what's weird about wild wild country and
it's weird about all these crazy sex 

2880
02:07:15,151 --> 02:07:16,350
cult.
It's like part of it.

2881
02:07:16,351 --> 02:07:17,430
You Go,
yeah.

2882
02:07:17,431 --> 02:07:19,380
Like they got,
they got something going on.

2883
02:07:19,381 --> 02:07:20,214
That's right.
Like the figuring out something like 

2884
02:07:22,111 --> 02:07:22,944
they're a little bit.
I couldn't figure out about that was 

2885
02:07:24,091 --> 02:07:28,560
where was the flash point where this guy
became this guy.

2886
02:07:28,590 --> 02:07:33,540
Like what was the thing he did make 
everybody believe because that was never

2887
02:07:33,541 --> 02:07:36,130
made clear to me.
I never understood like,

2888
02:07:36,370 --> 02:07:37,203
okay,
I can understand people getting this 

2889
02:07:38,380 --> 02:07:39,213
excited about it,
but what was the thing that he did or 

2890
02:07:42,011 --> 02:07:45,250
said or that.
And I never understood that

2891
02:07:45,270 --> 02:07:46,103
part of.
I've been reading this book and it's 

2892
02:07:47,311 --> 02:07:49,500
actually pretty interesting.
I actually have it right here,

2893
02:07:49,950 --> 02:07:52,320
the art of living and dying.
And uh,

2894
02:07:52,321 --> 02:07:54,170
he,
he wrote this book about one.

2895
02:07:54,480 --> 02:07:55,313
Yeah,
he wrote this book after he became Osho 

2896
02:07:57,660 --> 02:08:00,290
or maybe they published it after he 
became Osha,

2897
02:08:00,540 --> 02:08:02,050
but it's a very good book.
It's,

2898
02:08:02,051 --> 02:08:03,060
it's weird.
He's like,

2899
02:08:03,061 --> 02:08:06,270
he had some very good.
I know what I think I left it at home.

2900
02:08:07,800 --> 02:08:08,633
Oh No,
here it is.

2901
02:08:08,700 --> 02:08:09,533
He had some very good ideas,
like it's like he's like 

2902
02:08:12,200 --> 02:08:14,940
philosophically,
he's a fascinating guy.

2903
02:08:15,340 --> 02:08:16,173
Um,
or it was a fascinating guy and there's 

2904
02:08:18,211 --> 02:08:21,120
real good evidence that his followers 
fucking poisoned him.

2905
02:08:21,930 --> 02:08:24,300
Like there's a lot of people,
I shouldn't say this real good evidence.

2906
02:08:24,330 --> 02:08:25,163
There's a lot of people that filed the 
case very closely that believe that 

2907
02:08:28,801 --> 02:08:32,190
people close to him may have poisoned 
him and taking his,

2908
02:08:32,400 --> 02:08:35,160
taking his money.
So the whole thing,

2909
02:08:35,220 --> 02:08:36,053
the,
you know,

2910
02:08:36,510 --> 02:08:38,350
I mean the whole thing was just a 
massive mind.

2911
02:08:38,351 --> 02:08:39,184
Fuck.
Those houses are still there in that 

2912
02:08:40,861 --> 02:08:44,170
place like that,
that ranch that those guys set up,

2913
02:08:44,300 --> 02:08:46,080
they're either all would've mentioned 
down the,

2914
02:08:46,081 --> 02:08:48,360
they show to the end of the documentary 
and you're like,

2915
02:08:48,361 --> 02:08:49,380
whoa.

2916
02:08:51,060 --> 02:08:52,860
And there's an interesting.
Now the dude,

2917
02:08:53,790 --> 02:08:54,621
I don't know if you've ever heard of 
him,

2918
02:08:54,621 --> 02:08:56,450
a guy named Dr.
Malakai York.

2919
02:08:56,740 --> 02:08:57,620
No.
Who's that guy?

2920
02:08:57,690 --> 02:08:58,523
This.
He started in New York doing this like 

2921
02:09:01,910 --> 02:09:02,743
sort of Islamic sec thing.
He did and then he brought it into like 

2922
02:09:05,960 --> 02:09:09,220
aliens and and ancient Hebrew stuff.
He liked it,

2923
02:09:09,250 --> 02:09:11,330
brought all this stuff together,
all these philosophies.

2924
02:09:11,331 --> 02:09:14,420
And he made this Utopian society and 
like Georgia.

2925
02:09:14,570 --> 02:09:15,403
Oh,
but like the dude was like doing mad 

2926
02:09:16,821 --> 02:09:17,654
criminal shit and they got it.
I don't know if there's any movie about 

2927
02:09:20,211 --> 02:09:22,400
this,
but I'm going to smile,

2928
02:09:23,260 --> 02:09:24,840
but this dude was like,
oh,

2929
02:09:24,930 --> 02:09:26,190
maybe,
look,

2930
02:09:26,220 --> 02:09:28,400
I look at Smiley.
He is,

2931
02:09:29,550 --> 02:09:32,560
it's an incredibly crazy story.
Damn.

2932
02:09:32,610 --> 02:09:35,470
They put them away for 135 years.
Yeah,

2933
02:09:35,640 --> 02:09:36,473
he was doing some stuff like sex cult 
stuff was going on with stuff in it and 

2934
02:09:40,781 --> 02:09:41,930
you know,
always becomes that,

2935
02:09:41,960 --> 02:09:42,793
you know,

2936
02:09:44,790 --> 02:09:45,623
wow,

2937
02:09:46,800 --> 02:09:51,070
cool there because I've never seen 
definitive.

2938
02:09:51,071 --> 02:09:51,904
I've read this and that.
So it's like there's motherfuckers to 

2939
02:09:53,621 --> 02:09:54,610
say it was like,
you know,

2940
02:09:54,611 --> 02:09:55,444
you set up and all this shit and that he
had such a perfect society going that 

2941
02:09:58,390 --> 02:10:00,160
nobody wanted,
that they would succeed,

2942
02:10:00,320 --> 02:10:01,030
you know,
that,

2943
02:10:01,030 --> 02:10:02,100
you know,
like,

2944
02:10:02,110 --> 02:10:02,943
I mean,
I'm pretty sure it's been proven that 

2945
02:10:03,551 --> 02:10:05,380
the dude was doing some pretty criminal 
shit.

2946
02:10:05,740 --> 02:10:06,573
Here's two things that seem to happen 
whenever anybody runs any kind of crazy 

2947
02:10:10,391 --> 02:10:15,391
called or any sort of like a weird 
community outside the norm.

2948
02:10:17,890 --> 02:10:18,723
It always becomes sex.
It always becomes like the dudes as a 

2949
02:10:21,740 --> 02:10:25,420
man.
I think that's what got him in trouble.

2950
02:10:25,600 --> 02:10:26,433
I'm and I'm,
I feel like I remember there being some 

2951
02:10:28,661 --> 02:10:29,240
sexual.
Yeah.

2952
02:10:29,240 --> 02:10:32,620
They're having sex with children.
Oh yes.

2953
02:10:32,900 --> 02:10:33,980
That's what they got.
If

2954
02:10:33,980 --> 02:10:36,380
they wanted to bust him on something.
I mean,

2955
02:10:36,381 --> 02:10:37,850
if they're really wanting to bring them 
down,

2956
02:10:37,851 --> 02:10:39,380
that's what they would accuse him up.
I mean,

2957
02:10:39,381 --> 02:10:40,214
you can't truly,
once someone accuses you have sex with 

2958
02:10:42,141 --> 02:10:44,060
children.
Even if you're not guilty,

2959
02:10:44,420 --> 02:10:45,253
it's on you forever.
But the thing is like these no one has 

2960
02:10:48,861 --> 02:10:52,580
ever pulled off like a Utopian 
alternative society.

2961
02:10:52,610 --> 02:10:54,590
Never.
It's crazy.

2962
02:10:54,920 --> 02:10:59,030
It's really interesting because at the 
entire history of the United States,

2963
02:10:59,090 --> 02:11:01,940
no one's been able to do it like they 
try it,

2964
02:11:02,150 --> 02:11:05,210
they'll try it for a little bit and then
it falls apart every single one of them.

2965
02:11:05,270 --> 02:11:07,970
That's amazing.
It's amazing that no one,

2966
02:11:08,060 --> 02:11:10,390
whether it's Waco,
no one like this.

2967
02:11:10,440 --> 02:11:12,410
I look at it like the line from the 
Matrix.

2968
02:11:12,411 --> 02:11:13,244
It's like our first version of the 
matrix kept failing because it was all 

2969
02:11:16,161 --> 02:11:16,994
too good and too nice.
We had to fuck it up a little for 

2970
02:11:18,591 --> 02:11:19,590
everybody will accept it.

2971
02:11:23,390 --> 02:11:27,430
It's just to me it's,
it's quite fascinating that you know,

2972
02:11:27,610 --> 02:11:30,800
we stick to a standard way of living,
which is,

2973
02:11:30,801 --> 02:11:31,634
you know,
our modern industrial western 

2974
02:11:33,651 --> 02:11:34,484
civilization and that is it in any 
deviation of that is scrutinized to the 

2975
02:11:38,661 --> 02:11:41,570
point where it's dismantled and the 
government steps in.

2976
02:11:41,600 --> 02:11:45,320
They always have guns too.
There was a guns and gun.

2977
02:11:45,370 --> 02:11:46,203
Wait too many guns because they're,
they want to protect their way of life 

2978
02:11:48,021 --> 02:11:50,780
and then someone's banging people's 
wives and taken all the money.

2979
02:11:51,320 --> 02:11:52,153
Fascinating.
It's weird that no one has figured it 

2980
02:11:54,741 --> 02:11:55,574
out.
Not One group has just got it nailed it 

2981
02:11:57,690 --> 02:11:58,523
once.
Probably part of the thing that power 

2982
02:11:59,601 --> 02:12:00,434
corrupts.
You can't have one person that's like 

2983
02:12:01,790 --> 02:12:02,710
the Almighty.
No.

2984
02:12:02,720 --> 02:12:03,553
It all over over thing because he's 
going to take advantage and then 

2985
02:12:06,021 --> 02:12:08,480
somebody smart within click is going to 
say,

2986
02:12:08,481 --> 02:12:10,370
hey,
this is not right and it's going to fall

2987
02:12:10,371 --> 02:12:11,204
apart and it always is one person or 
there's going to be a person underneath 

2988
02:12:15,411 --> 02:12:18,290
that wants that position and it's going 
to do something to get it.

2989
02:12:18,770 --> 02:12:22,730
But it's always like one charismatic 
person that seems to lead these things.

2990
02:12:23,420 --> 02:12:25,790
Like whether it's Jonestown or whether 
it's Waco,

2991
02:12:25,820 --> 02:12:27,050
Charles Manson.
Yup,

2992
02:12:27,230 --> 02:12:28,130
Yup.
Yeah.

2993
02:12:28,131 --> 02:12:30,110
It's always one.
One Dude's like,

2994
02:12:30,111 --> 02:12:32,360
this society is fucked up,
man.

2995
02:12:32,480 --> 02:12:34,490
You can take that and apply it to 
Hitler.

2996
02:12:34,550 --> 02:12:35,361
Yup,
sure.

2997
02:12:35,361 --> 02:12:36,230
Me.
Yeah.

2998
02:12:36,440 --> 02:12:40,160
One guy gets to everybody's attention 
and next thing you know.

2999
02:12:41,270 --> 02:12:42,140
Yeah,
it is weird,

3000
02:12:42,141 --> 02:12:44,450
isn't it?
Like this desire to have like our big,

3001
02:12:44,480 --> 02:12:46,580
uh,
big daddy who got all the answers,

3002
02:12:46,730 --> 02:12:48,890
who's better than us because we're all 
so confused.

3003
02:12:48,891 --> 02:12:52,070
It would be very comforting if someone 
came along who really understood at all,

3004
02:12:52,640 --> 02:12:55,820
I've got the solution.
They have a big ass giant,

3005
02:12:55,821 --> 02:12:59,770
crazy white beard like Osho did,
and then they bowed you,

3006
02:13:00,280 --> 02:13:03,480
their answers,
blame the people you wanted to blame and

3007
02:13:03,481 --> 02:13:04,460
make you.
You know what I mean?

3008
02:13:04,461 --> 02:13:06,840
That's another good technique is to make
sure you know,

3009
02:13:06,950 --> 02:13:08,540
what does everybody want to be.
Okay.

3010
02:13:08,541 --> 02:13:12,050
That's what we're going to blame it on.
We'll focus our hate capitalism.

3011
02:13:12,051 --> 02:13:13,440
That was,
you know,

3012
02:13:13,740 --> 02:13:17,420
a lot of these things don't work out 
because they have to be based on what we

3013
02:13:17,421 --> 02:13:18,670
talked about earlier.
Yep.

3014
02:13:19,190 --> 02:13:23,450
Doing unto others as you want them to 
try to fully living that lifestyle.

3015
02:13:23,470 --> 02:13:24,303
Yep.
All alright.

3016
02:13:24,320 --> 02:13:25,153
When it doesn't happen like that,
it's cats get the power they getting 

3017
02:13:28,321 --> 02:13:29,870
charged.
They want to keep that power.

3018
02:13:29,871 --> 02:13:31,010
They want to stay in charge

3019
02:13:32,180 --> 02:13:33,990
and they're not going to treat other 
people that way.

3020
02:13:33,991 --> 02:13:34,571
They want it.
They're gonna.

3021
02:13:34,571 --> 02:13:37,500
Start intimidating people because that's
the way you keep people in line.

3022
02:13:38,550 --> 02:13:41,730
Always.
People want to be subjugated,

3023
02:13:41,731 --> 02:13:42,780
man.
Like you saying.

3024
02:13:42,781 --> 02:13:43,560
They want it.
They want.

3025
02:13:43,560 --> 02:13:45,360
They didn't want somebody to babysit and
know,

3026
02:13:45,690 --> 02:13:46,523
oh,
I can just sit over here and just be 

3027
02:13:46,921 --> 02:13:47,731
dumb.
Okay,

3028
02:13:47,731 --> 02:13:49,590
cool.
And if no one was in charge,

3029
02:13:49,740 --> 02:13:51,830
someone would come along that would want
to be in charge of.

3030
02:13:51,860 --> 02:13:52,591
Someone would say,
you know what?

3031
02:13:52,591 --> 02:13:54,690
The problem with this organization is 
there's no leadership.

3032
02:13:55,800 --> 02:13:56,633
We need a strong leader.
We need someone who respects the values 

3033
02:13:58,980 --> 02:14:01,470
and principles this society was founded 
on,

3034
02:14:01,830 --> 02:14:04,590
but someone who also understands how to 
be a leader and then people go,

3035
02:14:04,591 --> 02:14:06,240
yes,
yes.

3036
02:14:07,530 --> 02:14:09,210
That makes so much sense.
Yes.

3037
02:14:09,270 --> 02:14:10,710
Guide us.
They just want to.

3038
02:14:11,060 --> 02:14:11,620
It's,
it's,

3039
02:14:11,620 --> 02:14:12,630
it's the same thing.

3040
02:14:12,660 --> 02:14:14,910
It's the,
it's what goes on in instagram.

3041
02:14:14,970 --> 02:14:16,770
Everybody wants to believe everybody's 
got their.

3042
02:14:16,830 --> 02:14:20,400
That that guy's got his shit together.
That guy's got his shit together,

3043
02:14:20,401 --> 02:14:20,911
man.
Fuck.

3044
02:14:20,911 --> 02:14:21,744
I want to be like that.
Not knowing that like behind the scenes 

3045
02:14:24,510 --> 02:14:26,370
he's falling apart.
It's falling the fuck apart,

3046
02:14:26,371 --> 02:14:26,971
man.
I know.

3047
02:14:26,971 --> 02:14:28,590
They're just trying to make it look like
they got there.

3048
02:14:28,610 --> 02:14:29,443
She had a friend recently.
No names or anything but like a friend 

3049
02:14:34,650 --> 02:14:39,020
in a couple you would never ever in your
life think debut.

3050
02:14:39,060 --> 02:14:39,930
The,
I mean,

3051
02:14:39,960 --> 02:14:41,010
I was like,
man,

3052
02:14:41,011 --> 02:14:42,620
I just want to have a relationship like 
yours,

3053
02:14:42,630 --> 02:14:45,360
you know what I mean?
And no foster mess anything.

3054
02:14:45,361 --> 02:14:50,361
One day I just turned around and they 
have their instagram names are different

3055
02:14:50,760 --> 02:14:52,150
and all of a sudden I call him 
whatsoever.

3056
02:14:52,220 --> 02:14:52,801
He's like,
oh yeah,

3057
02:14:52,801 --> 02:14:54,030
we just.
It didn't work.

3058
02:14:54,480 --> 02:14:55,600
We couldn't fake it and man was.

3059
02:14:56,530 --> 02:14:59,250
I don't know if that was,
if it's that serious,

3060
02:14:59,270 --> 02:15:00,103
but something it was just like just 
shows you none of that shit is real 

3061
02:15:02,101 --> 02:15:02,934
because we don't put.
We don't put our shit moments up for 

3062
02:15:06,001 --> 02:15:07,410
everybody to see.
Yeah.

3063
02:15:07,710 --> 02:15:08,543
Elon Musk talked about that to the 
people that you see on instagram that 

3064
02:15:11,221 --> 02:15:12,054
you think are on social media that you 
think are the happiest are probably the 

3065
02:15:15,060 --> 02:15:17,610
biggest smiles are fucking struggling 
the most for sure.

3066
02:15:17,880 --> 02:15:19,770
Yeah.
Well they're trying to project that.

3067
02:15:19,860 --> 02:15:23,250
They're always trying to project you the
best version of what their life is.

3068
02:15:23,251 --> 02:15:24,084
The best response all over my instagram 
when I post about my family or even our 

3069
02:15:28,771 --> 02:15:31,350
struggles like this,
this rough right now,

3070
02:15:31,680 --> 02:15:32,730
but you share it.
You say,

3071
02:15:32,760 --> 02:15:34,260
Huh,
but we're going to get through it.

3072
02:15:34,261 --> 02:15:36,600
We're going to be one of the things that
people like about you.

3073
02:15:36,730 --> 02:15:38,010
You know that you're real.

3074
02:15:38,040 --> 02:15:39,020
You're not.
I mean,

3075
02:15:39,060 --> 02:15:39,893
even though you're a famous guy who's 
been a successful musician for a long 

3076
02:15:42,151 --> 02:15:43,620
time,
so I used to be fast,

3077
02:15:43,710 --> 02:15:45,320
but you are,
you're,

3078
02:15:45,330 --> 02:15:46,650
you,
you're a normal dude.

3079
02:15:46,780 --> 02:15:49,650
You know,
I'd take that as the highest compliment.

3080
02:15:49,680 --> 02:15:51,490
You should.
It is the highest contact of that.

3081
02:15:51,660 --> 02:15:52,493
Seriously.
I gotta wrap this podcast up because I 

3082
02:15:54,130 --> 02:15:57,150
have to ship my brain before we do.
Unfortunately tomorrow night,

3083
02:15:57,151 --> 02:15:59,130
the Brooklyn Bowl,
Friday,

3084
02:15:59,131 --> 02:16:02,310
August fifth at the Brooklyn Bowl,
UFC ultimate pre party.

3085
02:16:02,550 --> 02:16:04,020
He wouldn't leave his hosting.
Oh,

3086
02:16:04,021 --> 02:16:04,860
