00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:02,880
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:06,300
Keep in mind that these narratives
of Ford by public opinion,

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:06,471
right,

4
00:00:06,471 --> 00:00:08,640
this isn't the studio is
trying to make the public,

5
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:10,020
um,

6
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,900
force feed the public like
gender roles and you know,

7
00:00:12,901 --> 00:00:14,310
whatever this is the public saying.

8
00:00:14,311 --> 00:00:15,001
I like that.

9
00:00:15,001 --> 00:00:15,781
I don't like that.

10
00:00:15,781 --> 00:00:19,410
So the studios are responding to the
questionnaires that these researchers give

11
00:00:19,411 --> 00:00:20,244
out.

12
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:22,530
So one of the really interesting things,

13
00:00:22,531 --> 00:00:23,880
and this is totally inflammatory,

14
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,600
but the,

15
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,100
the role of the person
defending like physically,

16
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,690
physically defending the community when
they try to put a woman in that role,

17
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,190
people have a problem with it.

18
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:35,491
And,

19
00:00:35,491 --> 00:00:35,880
and,

20
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:36,720
and frankly,

21
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,340
often women have a problem with it.

22
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,211
Like it's real,

23
00:00:39,211 --> 00:00:39,751
it's really,

24
00:00:39,751 --> 00:00:40,584
really interesting.

25
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,460
And women are just as important
as men in a crisis or in anything,

26
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:45,323
right?

27
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:46,081
But the,

28
00:00:46,081 --> 00:00:50,340
what the public seems to want is the guy
with the sword and the woman with the

29
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:51,174
bandage,

30
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:51,520
you know,

31
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:51,700
or,

32
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:52,110
or,

33
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:53,730
or with the sort of reassuring,

34
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,270
you know,

35
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:57,060
like he gets divided
like that and it's not,

36
00:00:57,061 --> 00:00:57,361
again,

37
00:00:57,361 --> 00:01:00,090
it's not the studios
forcing something on people.

38
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,750
Is it the people watching these films
saying just voting on what they,

39
00:01:03,751 --> 00:01:05,310
the narrative that they'd like best.

40
00:01:05,311 --> 00:01:05,660
But the,

41
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:08,100
the other character that I
thought was really hilarious,

42
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:09,800
there's often that there is eight,

43
00:01:09,801 --> 00:01:13,320
an estranged husband who's betrayed
his wife and family in some way.

44
00:01:13,321 --> 00:01:14,220
He's on the outs,

45
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:15,203
right?

46
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:15,750
Uh,

47
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:15,980
uh,

48
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:16,980
with his family and his,

49
00:01:16,981 --> 00:01:17,850
with his wife.

50
00:01:17,851 --> 00:01:19,070
And then the crisis happens.

51
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:21,120
The martians invade the floodwaters rise,

52
00:01:21,121 --> 00:01:21,954
whatever it is,

53
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:27,270
and he comes to the rescue and does
the right thing and saves his wife and

54
00:01:27,271 --> 00:01:29,430
family and maybe even
the wife's new boyfriend.

55
00:01:29,431 --> 00:01:29,641
I mean,

56
00:01:29,641 --> 00:01:29,741
he,

57
00:01:29,741 --> 00:01:31,230
Keven could have gotten to that stage,

58
00:01:31,231 --> 00:01:31,890
right?

59
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:33,630
And because he does the right thing,

60
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:34,830
she takes them back.

61
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:37,530
God,

62
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:38,221
it's funny,

63
00:01:38,221 --> 00:01:38,461
man.

64
00:01:38,461 --> 00:01:41,550
It's really just playing out
these ancient archetypes.

65
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,720
It's exactly what it's doing.

66
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:43,141
I mean,

67
00:01:43,141 --> 00:01:43,480
they,

68
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:43,710
I mean,

69
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:47,160
those storylines resonate because
they're ancient and because those,

70
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,650
those roles in society helped us survive.

71
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:51,570
And then it dawned on me,

72
00:01:51,571 --> 00:01:52,111
wait a second.

73
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:56,340
Stamets you're in the tallest tree on
the tallest hill for miles in the middle

74
00:01:56,341 --> 00:01:57,480
of a lightning storm.

75
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,970
This is not the best place to be.

76
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,420
And so I realize I
could be killed up here.

77
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:04,800
Suddenly I had a reality rush.

78
00:02:04,801 --> 00:02:05,220
Like,

79
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,040
you know,

80
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,873
you're,

81
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,190
you could turn into a god.

82
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:14,690
Imagine Comics Kaia 20 grams
of mushrooms hugging a tree.

83
00:02:15,151 --> 00:02:18,160
The lightning comes and hits you and Paul,

84
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,800
maybe you were the savior.

85
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,480
Maybe you need to get back to that tree.

86
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:23,700
Maybe you're the chosen one.

87
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,320
So I,

88
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:26,851
I was,

89
00:02:26,851 --> 00:02:27,170
you know,

90
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:27,720
I,

91
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,930
it was an incredibly spiritual
and wonderful experience,

92
00:02:30,931 --> 00:02:33,750
but I also had the fear and just comes,

93
00:02:33,751 --> 00:02:34,440
comes with it.

94
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,400
The Hero's journey,

95
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:35,971
you know,

96
00:02:35,971 --> 00:02:38,520
you always have the dark side.

97
00:02:38,521 --> 00:02:39,211
He always have,

98
00:02:39,211 --> 00:02:40,320
not just the light side,

99
00:02:40,321 --> 00:02:42,150
but it's counterbalanced
with the dark side.

100
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:43,200
Then I realized,

101
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,033
oh my gosh,

102
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:44,550
I'm gonna,

103
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:45,390
I could die up here.

104
00:02:45,391 --> 00:02:45,810
And I said,

105
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:46,200
well,

106
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:46,861
I don't die.

107
00:02:46,861 --> 00:02:47,790
Stamets which,

108
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:48,750
where are your issues?

109
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:49,380
This,

110
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,330
this gets something
out of this experience.

111
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:52,973
I said,

112
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,790
this stuttering habit is ridiculous and I,

113
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:57,240
I'm not stupid.

114
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:57,961
And I saw,

115
00:02:57,961 --> 00:02:58,780
I said to myself,

116
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,490
stop stuttering now.

117
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,140
Stop Stuttering now.

118
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,390
I said that dozens,

119
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:06,640
hundreds of times over and over and over.

120
00:03:06,641 --> 00:03:11,641
And fortunately the storms went past
and held onto the tree and soaking wet.

121
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:15,760
I came out of the tree and lock
back to where I was living.

122
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,030
And then the next day I got up,

123
00:03:19,031 --> 00:03:23,500
I didn't see anybody and I was walking
along on this path and a sidewalk and

124
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,570
there's a lady that I really liked a lot.

125
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,793
And uh,

126
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:30,130
but she was always attracted to the
super self assured jocks and things like

127
00:03:30,131 --> 00:03:30,341
that.

128
00:03:30,341 --> 00:03:32,530
She was actually very kind and sweet,

129
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:37,210
but I didn't want to stare at her
in the eyes because I would stutter.

130
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,460
And it's humiliating for us.

131
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,640
So the more humiliating
us stutterers feel,

132
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,170
the more we stutter.

133
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:46,900
And so it's a really slippery slope.

134
00:03:46,901 --> 00:03:48,940
And so I would avoid eye contact.

135
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:52,930
And so for the first time
she walked towards him,

136
00:03:52,931 --> 00:03:53,230
he says,

137
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:53,921
Good Morning Paul,

138
00:03:53,921 --> 00:03:54,431
how are you?

139
00:03:54,431 --> 00:03:58,180
She was always so nice to me and I was
terrified because I'd embarrass myself.

140
00:03:58,181 --> 00:04:00,310
And I looked at her straight
in the eyes and I said,

141
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,121
I'm doing fine.

142
00:04:01,121 --> 00:04:01,954
How are you?

143
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,240
And I stopped stuttering in one day.

144
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,450
Whoa.

145
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:10,060
And this speaks to now what was been
medically proven is that we can reset the

146
00:04:10,061 --> 00:04:13,030
neurology of the human
brain through neurogenesis.

147
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:17,890
What do you think is a real no bullshit
achievable time for you at full

148
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:18,460
marathon?

149
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:19,293
Full Marathon.

150
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,111
Jamie,

151
00:04:20,111 --> 00:04:20,681
you got to help me.

152
00:04:20,681 --> 00:04:23,440
You run for 45 to a little over two.

153
00:04:23,441 --> 00:04:25,900
It'd be a pretty good full marathons,

154
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:26,763
full nights.

155
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:32,290
Five fives as it got five has to be a
good mark because after that three hour

156
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:33,760
mark or even doing the half,

157
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:35,920
you're going to hit a real tough wall,

158
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:39,130
but you also will be running
with a pace group the whole time,

159
00:04:39,131 --> 00:04:40,500
which helps and I'll do anything.

160
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:43,060
I have to go with them no matter what.

161
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,900
I have to go with that.

162
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:44,740
Five hours,

163
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,000
five hours.

164
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,141
That's hilarious.

165
00:04:47,141 --> 00:04:48,310
I don't even know what I'm saying.

166
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:52,090
I'm thinking about draining my bank
account to bet you hold on Joe.

167
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,520
Five hours.

168
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,960
What are we doing here?

169
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:59,700
I like this like do you think
he could do it for five hours?

170
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:00,723
Yeah.

171
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,450
Hey,

172
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:01,831
hold on.

173
00:05:01,831 --> 00:05:02,664
I'm looking at it saying this.

174
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:05,660
Wow.

175
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:08,880
Take an Ra and I could
make some serious money on,

176
00:05:08,881 --> 00:05:09,330
let's get up,

177
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:09,870
let's get it.

178
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:12,090
Let's get a course that we're
talking cause we're not going to,

179
00:05:12,091 --> 00:05:13,200
can't do one in Colorado.

180
00:05:13,201 --> 00:05:14,040
Obviously I want to,

181
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:16,230
I want to Boston,

182
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,690
it'll keep you a lot
to say like five hours.

183
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,910
You would have to really prepare.

184
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:22,503
No,

185
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:24,343
he's willing.

186
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,370
I want to see what he's
at now shape right now.

187
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:26,791
So wait,

188
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:27,091
he,

189
00:05:27,091 --> 00:05:29,340
you'd have to really
prepare to do five hours.

190
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,420
I think you could do it.

191
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:31,590
I'm not saying you couldn't do it.

192
00:05:31,591 --> 00:05:32,850
If we're not giving you a year,

193
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:33,271
idiot,

194
00:05:33,271 --> 00:05:34,104
fuck,

195
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:34,963
you're going to do it.

196
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,590
What's the next marathon?

197
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:38,571
What's the,

198
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:39,020
what,

199
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,020
what city are they going to be in?

200
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:41,871
San Diego,

201
00:05:41,871 --> 00:05:45,910
La [inaudible]

202
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:46,500
you know,

203
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,710
do you know the story of Viagara
and how that was developed was,

204
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,010
um,

205
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:52,170
some sort of a blood pressure medication,

206
00:05:52,171 --> 00:05:52,650
correct.

207
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:53,190
Right.

208
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,640
And uh,

209
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:56,740
yeah,

210
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,220
so they found like,

211
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:58,551
okay,

212
00:05:58,551 --> 00:06:01,220
this isn't working very well
for what we designed it for,

213
00:06:01,221 --> 00:06:01,700
but,

214
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,940
but it's got some pretty
interesting effects.

215
00:06:04,941 --> 00:06:05,480
And so,

216
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,960
but they knew it wasn't enough to just
then go out there and start selling it

217
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:10,400
for two guys to say,

218
00:06:10,401 --> 00:06:11,234
hey,

219
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,480
here's a drug that will help
make you perform better.

220
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:14,790
Right.

221
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:15,320
Bedroom.

222
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,310
That wasn't enough.

223
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:21,760
What they had to do was create a disease
that it could be prescribed for because

224
00:06:21,861 --> 00:06:22,430
that's,

225
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,060
and then,

226
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,500
and then you know how they did that,

227
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:29,480
they hired an advertising agency and
the ad agency came up with the term

228
00:06:29,481 --> 00:06:30,860
erectile dysfunction.

229
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:31,790
No Way.

230
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:32,870
And created this.

231
00:06:32,871 --> 00:06:33,530
No Way.

232
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:34,191
Absolutely.

233
00:06:34,191 --> 00:06:38,120
It's publicly available
information named a disease.

234
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,450
This is not the only case
where this has happened.

235
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:46,460
So they create this disease category and
then they'd get it out into the world

236
00:06:46,461 --> 00:06:50,840
and they advertise it to people and to
doctors and so all of a sudden people are

237
00:06:50,841 --> 00:06:52,430
going in with the magazine.

238
00:06:52,431 --> 00:06:53,264
They're like,

239
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:54,523
this is me.

240
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,960
I have erectile dysfunction.

241
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:02,300
And I know now there's a
drug called Viagara that I
need because I have erectile

242
00:07:02,301 --> 00:07:02,871
dysfunction.

243
00:07:02,871 --> 00:07:04,070
And the doctor has seen the,

244
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,160
they have their own brochure.

245
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:05,360
Yeah.

246
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,970
They pull out their brochure and
it says erectile dysfunction.

247
00:07:07,971 --> 00:07:09,020
Here are the signs and symptoms.

248
00:07:09,021 --> 00:07:09,291
Okay.

249
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:09,591
Check,

250
00:07:09,591 --> 00:07:09,831
check,

251
00:07:09,831 --> 00:07:10,041
check,

252
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:10,311
check.

253
00:07:10,311 --> 00:07:10,611
Yes.

254
00:07:10,611 --> 00:07:12,440
This patient's got erectile Ed.

255
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,333
So here's the drug.

256
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,130
Oh,

257
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:19,130
is it legal for an advertising
agency to name a disorder?

258
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:20,090
Well,

259
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:23,900
I'll tell you that it's illegal in every
single country in the world except for

260
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:28,040
New Zealand and the United States
to advertise drugs to consumers.

261
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:31,080
Please New Zealand be the first strange.

262
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,630
Please turn around,

263
00:07:32,631 --> 00:07:35,030
make us look terrible at
first because this is the,

264
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:36,110
this is the result.

265
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:40,190
This is the result of allowing drugs
to be advertised is that you get

266
00:07:40,191 --> 00:07:44,780
advertising agencies creating conditions
that then required drugs to be treated.

267
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:45,301
And this,

268
00:07:45,301 --> 00:07:45,481
you know,

269
00:07:45,481 --> 00:07:47,010
this is like the air I'm
hanging out with Dennis.

270
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:47,490
I mean,

271
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:49,380
look at Dennis this size compared to Shaq.

272
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,200
If you didn't know it was Dennis Rodman,

273
00:07:52,201 --> 00:07:53,010
it was just some,

274
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:54,600
you know NBA Scrub,

275
00:07:54,601 --> 00:07:55,290
right?

276
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:57,720
You would think there's no way that
guy's going to guard him one on one.

277
00:07:57,930 --> 00:07:59,370
Especially Shaq in his prime there.

278
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,300
There's no way.

279
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:01,733
Yeah,

280
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,710
it's Rodman is a crazy guy.

281
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:05,731
That's interesting.

282
00:08:05,731 --> 00:08:06,564
Speaking crazy.

283
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,070
Can I tell you a funny story?

284
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,030
He got a good story.

285
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:09,863
Yeah.

286
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,950
So used to hang out a lot with Dennis,

287
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:12,360
uh,

288
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:12,840
and uh,

289
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,673
you know,

290
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,030
hadn't seen him for years.

291
00:08:15,031 --> 00:08:15,864
Was that a restaurant?

292
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,580
Chicago not too long ago.

293
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:18,853
And um,

294
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:20,760
and somebody said,

295
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:21,360
oh,

296
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,350
you guys are friends with Dennis,

297
00:08:22,351 --> 00:08:22,591
right?

298
00:08:22,591 --> 00:08:22,861
Yeah,

299
00:08:22,861 --> 00:08:23,280
yeah.

300
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:23,401
Oh,

301
00:08:23,401 --> 00:08:24,234
he's upstairs.

302
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:24,781
Oh really?

303
00:08:24,781 --> 00:08:25,321
We go upstairs.

304
00:08:25,321 --> 00:08:26,220
Dennis is crying.

305
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:26,731
Oh my God.

306
00:08:26,731 --> 00:08:27,551
I miss you guys.

307
00:08:27,551 --> 00:08:31,890
And me and my buddy were hanging
out with them telling old stories,

308
00:08:31,891 --> 00:08:32,101
you know,

309
00:08:32,101 --> 00:08:32,911
seven or eight years,

310
00:08:32,911 --> 00:08:33,744
haven't seen him.

311
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:34,320
This is great.

312
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:34,531
Like,

313
00:08:34,531 --> 00:08:34,770
uh,

314
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:39,210
when you see a buddy you really love and
it's really affectionate and Dennis is

315
00:08:39,211 --> 00:08:41,700
one of those people at some point
he just gets up and he wanders away.

316
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:43,710
I think he's going to take a piss.

317
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,310
Okay.

318
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:45,450
About 10 minutes goes by,

319
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:46,770
I say to the waitress.

320
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,700
To Dennis leave.

321
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:47,911
Yeah,

322
00:08:47,911 --> 00:08:48,744
he left.

323
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:49,440
Okay.

324
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,370
I just figured he's gone.

325
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,360
It's just the way he is.

326
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:51,760
Right.

327
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,593
They wouldn't even say goodbye.

328
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:53,483
Just gone.

329
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:54,870
I get up the next morning,

330
00:08:54,871 --> 00:08:55,740
I the television,

331
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,450
Dennis Rodman's in North Korea.

332
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,333
Okay.

333
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:00,910
I,

334
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:01,201
by the way,

335
00:09:01,201 --> 00:09:02,550
I spend an hour and a half with them.

336
00:09:02,551 --> 00:09:03,151
He didn't say anything.

337
00:09:03,151 --> 00:09:04,170
We go about going to North Korea,

338
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:04,940
right?

339
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:05,820
So I turn on the television,

340
00:09:05,821 --> 00:09:07,590
it's like very controversial.

341
00:09:07,591 --> 00:09:08,700
Dennis Rodman's in North Korea.

342
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,970
So I text my buddy and I say,

343
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,370
have you seen the news?

344
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:15,091
No.

345
00:09:15,091 --> 00:09:15,924
What?

346
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:16,740
I say,

347
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,730
turn on the television.

348
00:09:17,731 --> 00:09:18,121
And he said,

349
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:18,661
what channel?

350
00:09:18,661 --> 00:09:18,961
I said,

351
00:09:18,961 --> 00:09:19,890
it doesn't matter.

352
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:22,950
And two minutes goes by,

353
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,000
Holy Fuck.

354
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,980
Because he went through the same thing,

355
00:09:25,981 --> 00:09:26,814
you know?

356
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:36,900
Okay.
