1
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,840
Is Our whole new setup. We're an
ht now you're gonna look beautiful.

2
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:12,410
I don't need, I need to not HD.
I need like cheese cloth Vaseline

3
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:24,390
in HD. We got multicolored look at the
colors, different colors for the buttons.

4
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:26,940
Now that's huge.
When you get lit up colors.

5
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,090
That's what I thought the future was
gonna look like when there's computers and

6
00:00:30,091 --> 00:00:34,300
like 2015 I thought it would be like
the inside of like a space ship.

7
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,520
Is that what Star Trek? Yeah,
like multicolored. All buttons.

8
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:44,220
That is how, right? That's the tricaster.
So we're in HD now. Your beautiful baby.

9
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,680
You're beautiful. Look
at you. You're beautiful.

10
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:49,000
Oh fuck. I need hair. Him.
Where's my hair and makeup?

11
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:52,810
What's going on, man? You
fucking savage. World Traveler.

12
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,080
You're the most savage world traveler.
I know you're the do.

13
00:00:56,081 --> 00:00:59,800
And I'll get a text message from you and
you're in fucking Bulgaria or some shit.

14
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,090
You're in North Korea on some wacky
cell systems. The communists. You, your,

15
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:05,560
your

16
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,340
well, what? I didn't text you from North
Korea because they won't let me. But, uh,

17
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:13,990
yeah, I was just in Antarctica and
the South Pole. That's hard to get to.

18
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:14,710
Very hard to get

19
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:16,060
do.
You were one of the,

20
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:20,330
your special was one of the first things
that I ever saw on North Korea that

21
00:01:20,331 --> 00:01:23,930
made me like really start to investigate
it. Like I knew that they had,

22
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:27,770
there was a lot of human rights
violations in this horrible,

23
00:01:27,771 --> 00:01:29,840
the things that they're
doing to people in prisons,

24
00:01:29,841 --> 00:01:34,841
but I want you going to
those fake restaurants and
having these people take you

25
00:01:36,981 --> 00:01:40,640
around and trying to present you with
this image of what North Korea is like.

26
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:44,720
Like oh, it's just like everywhere else
coming here. And you were like really,

27
00:01:44,721 --> 00:01:47,720
you know, talking about it pretty
openly on camera while you were there.

28
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,120
And that made me really
like start to look into it.

29
00:01:50,121 --> 00:01:53,960
And this is before all this shit has
gone down with the interview of course.

30
00:01:53,961 --> 00:01:56,510
And before the poor people really,

31
00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:01,910
I think like after his dad died, that's
when people really got a sense of like,

32
00:02:01,911 --> 00:02:05,660
well this is not going to end
here if this crazy communist,

33
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,980
this is like the last
real crazy communistic

34
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,430
tater. Yeah. Like the old school
sort of Utopian Communist,

35
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:18,320
a cult of personality. Their God
there, you know the president,

36
00:02:18,321 --> 00:02:23,120
they're the, they're, you know George
Washington there, everything. And uh,

37
00:02:23,121 --> 00:02:26,000
yeah, it's still going on, which
is is crazy. In fact, they,

38
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:30,230
they pick Kim Jong UN cause he looked
like his grandfather came in the song and

39
00:02:30,231 --> 00:02:33,530
so the people were like, oh, you know,
they're the same guy kind of thing.

40
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:38,160
It's so we, I mean I was always,
I'm one of those people that uh,

41
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:41,420
I'll get something on my head and then
that will be stuck in my head for weeks

42
00:02:41,421 --> 00:02:44,990
and weeks and weeks for a long time
was the Mongols and people like to,

43
00:02:44,991 --> 00:02:48,410
but you just shut the fuck up about the
Mongols and I wouldn't see that movie.

44
00:02:48,411 --> 00:02:52,100
Mongol. Yeah, I did. So good. Pretty
good. So no, it's really good man.

45
00:02:52,101 --> 00:02:56,360
Marco Polo on check it out. Yeah.
It deals with cu black Kahn.

46
00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:01,010
Who's like the descendants, the
grandson of of Genghis Khan. Yes. Yeah.

47
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:05,680
I suppose I always had gangas Jengas but
then I got into North Korea after your

48
00:03:05,681 --> 00:03:09,580
show, after watching you and that
restaurant calling like weird short raid.

49
00:03:09,581 --> 00:03:12,670
This is the government's putting
on a charade for journalists.

50
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,010
And also I was thinking like they fucking,

51
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:19,270
they kitten have people like you go
in there and do and that was pretty

52
00:03:19,271 --> 00:03:20,104
dangerous.
Yeah.

53
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:24,120
There's another film. Um, we, we
interviewed the woman actually,

54
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,910
I think they just sold the rights
were they're making the film.

55
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:30,030
It's a crazy story of,
um,

56
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:34,200
there was like basically the
Orson Welles of South Korea.

57
00:03:34,201 --> 00:03:39,201
So after the war they had this crazy
film scene going on in South Korea and

58
00:03:39,271 --> 00:03:43,110
there was like the Orson Welles and
like the hottest start at their Marilyn

59
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:43,943
Monroe basically.
Right.

60
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:47,100
And there were husband and wife and they
ended up getting into a fight and the

61
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:51,540
wife goes to Japan, she's crying, she's
pissed off, she goes to Tokyo, boom,

62
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,590
disappears. Right. And it only can
find, or what the fuck's going on.

63
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:59,130
So he goes to Tokyo, boom, he disappears.

64
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:04,050
Now it turns out they were kidnapped by
the North Koreans, right? By Kim Il Sung.

65
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:09,000
Yeah. And so they had made this film
studio, which I actually went to.

66
00:04:09,001 --> 00:04:14,001
It's a complete replica of 20th Century
Fox back in the 50s and they make all

67
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:18,720
these anti American films.
Anyway, it turned out that
the woman who key kidnapped,

68
00:04:18,721 --> 00:04:23,430
he turned into sort of a a sex slave
and the star of all these North Korean

69
00:04:23,431 --> 00:04:25,680
propaganda movies,
cause he used to make a ton of movies.

70
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:30,300
They get the husband and say, now you're
going to direct her in these movies,

71
00:04:30,301 --> 00:04:34,230
right? They kidnapped him in Tokyo. And he
said, fuck you, I'm not going to do that.

72
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:38,160
So they had put them in a concentration
camp, which a Korean concentration camp,

73
00:04:38,161 --> 00:04:39,360
maybe the worst place in the world.

74
00:04:39,361 --> 00:04:42,660
So he's eating grass and he's
being tortured five years, right.

75
00:04:42,661 --> 00:04:46,800
Five fucking years. He's in this
concentration camp. Finally he says, okay,

76
00:04:46,801 --> 00:04:48,360
I'll do it.
I'll direct the films.

77
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,070
So they let him out and he
goes to Kim Jong UN's palace.

78
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,620
Uh, and then all of a sudden, uh,

79
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:58,560
there's his wife and his wife all
of a sudden realizes, holy shit,

80
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:01,920
he's a alive be. He came to get me, see,

81
00:05:01,921 --> 00:05:05,100
he's been in the concentration
camp and he realizes, oh,

82
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,210
she's been eating shrimp pattern
all day. Fucking GIM junk. He'll,

83
00:05:09,211 --> 00:05:11,970
while I'm in the concentration camp,
in any case,

84
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:15,870
they get together and make like seven
movies, big movies for North Korea.

85
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:20,190
And in fact, one of them
called escape, no joke,

86
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:23,880
called escape get wins.
A Moscow like Oscar,

87
00:05:23,881 --> 00:05:27,840
like a Soviet Oscar at the time as
a reward, they get to go to Vienna,

88
00:05:27,841 --> 00:05:32,340
which was their dream because it's where
the third man was, was uh, was uh, filmed.

89
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:37,610
He then, and she [inaudible] their
tour of Vienna. They get their labs.

90
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:41,510
We were allowed to tour of Vienna. They
defect and they get out. And finally they,

91
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,710
because they escape and then he,

92
00:05:43,711 --> 00:05:46,020
they told the story and now
they're making a movie about it.

93
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,410
So they're probably going to shut that.
Whoever puts out,

94
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:53,490
I'm just going to get shut down to
fuck.

95
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,370
That is the craziest story. Yeah, true
story. Yeah. Can still live like that.

96
00:05:58,371 --> 00:06:02,600
I mean that's, that's basically the same
as people lived 5,000 years ago. I mean,

97
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,860
Shit, kidnapping, Peter, forcing
the wife to be a sex slave,

98
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:10,970
forcing the husband to a concentration
camp, torturing him, starving him.

99
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,710
Yeah. It's completely
insane. Whenever you,

100
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:18,240
whenever you start dealing with North
Korea at a, in any level about anything

101
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:22,730
crazy as fuck, it's just amazing that
it's still around like that. Yeah,

102
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:28,100
it is. She's such a, it's such an
archaic idea. I mean, it really is.

103
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:32,270
It doesn't fit in what we think
of as 2015 the modern world,

104
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:36,960
although it wasn't that long ago,
you know that you had style in his Russia,

105
00:06:36,961 --> 00:06:41,010
you had Maoist China, you had Hitler's
Germany where people just went, Yep,

106
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:45,090
that's the dude. He's the one who tells
us how to do everything, you know?

107
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:45,840
But it's,

108
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,990
I think it's really disturbing because
it's happening now and even though like

109
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:51,630
40 years ago or 50 years ago,
isn't it really that long ago?

110
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,690
Right now it feels like that could be us.

111
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:58,690
But I think if you look at what's
happening in Russia's not so far away,

112
00:06:58,691 --> 00:07:02,440
because obviously the, the, the thing
about North Korea, which is weird,

113
00:07:02,441 --> 00:07:06,520
is it's like going back to 1938 you know,
it's like going back in time.

114
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,970
But the thing about rush, if you
go to Russia now, they're like,

115
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:12,340
there is no economic crisis.
America did this to us,

116
00:07:12,341 --> 00:07:15,550
the oil is falling because
America did this to us. It's,

117
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:20,040
it's total cold war rhetoric.
And, and, and Putin is, you know,

118
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,280
the news are, he's, he's, he's taken
over all power and he, you know,

119
00:07:24,281 --> 00:07:27,910
he runs the press and you know, he
runs everything and, and it, it,

120
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:31,420
it's definitely not going forward
in Russia. It's going backwards.

121
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:34,660
Yeah. He's a weird case, isn't he? I mean,

122
00:07:34,661 --> 00:07:37,570
it's just so blatant that
this guy is a dictator.

123
00:07:37,571 --> 00:07:41,650
When you see what happens when there's
any sort of dispute over there,

124
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,090
and even with these
oligarchs takes them out.

125
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:48,320
They put him in jail and they
take their businesses. Yeah, sure.

126
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:50,090
And he's done this more than once,
right.

127
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:55,840
Did it to a guy recently and he only
wound up taking one of his oil businesses.

128
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,370
Yeah. And you know, he's done it with,
with famously with Gazprom and Rosneft,

129
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:02,710
um, where, you know,

130
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:06,440
one guy became the richest dude in the
world and three other guys got either

131
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:11,440
assassinated or went to jail. So I think
that when you look at it, you know, uh,

132
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:14,410
it's a tough place to do
business. Russia, unless you're,

133
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:19,270
unless you got a key card to the Kremlin,
you're not going to get anything done.

134
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:23,740
I mean, it's so blatant. It's
so blatant. It's so strange.

135
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,660
They just reactivated 28,

136
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:31,040
28 Cold War bases this year.
So they were done. Okay.

137
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:35,970
Cold War's over, you have luck. We're
done. Boom. 28 basis reactivated like, ah,

138
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,550
what,

139
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:41,720
what do you think that they feel like
the only way to recharge the economy is

140
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:44,360
being a full blown conflict
with the United States.

141
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:48,250
And I think that it was a
humiliation in Russia. Um, you know,

142
00:08:48,251 --> 00:08:51,370
we look at sort of Gorbachev and
Yeltsin and go, oh, you know,

143
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:55,980
they finally came to their senses and
joined the world and whatever, you know,

144
00:08:55,981 --> 00:09:00,570
Yeltsin drank a bit too much
or whatever. But uh, there,

145
00:09:00,571 --> 00:09:04,470
that's seen as a huge humiliation
as we, you know, we were at,

146
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:07,440
if not number one,
we were number two for a long time.

147
00:09:07,441 --> 00:09:10,700
And then we went to being
an also ran and that was a,

148
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:15,450
it was a lot of resentment there. A
B, then as oil came on the ascendancy,

149
00:09:15,451 --> 00:09:17,370
they're like, okay, we're going
to throw our weight around.

150
00:09:17,371 --> 00:09:21,380
So they were subsidizing oil, for
example, Cuba was subsidized. Well,

151
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,630
you know, one of the reasons why they're
like, oh, let's be friends again,

152
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:27,810
is there's no more oil sipes subsidies
and it's the same thing in, in,

153
00:09:27,811 --> 00:09:32,460
in the region. And then I think what
happened is Putin came along and said,

154
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,150
Russia is the best again and we're going
to fuck with people and we're going to

155
00:09:36,151 --> 00:09:39,870
take back our land that they took from
us and we're going to take back this and

156
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,460
our military the best.

157
00:09:41,461 --> 00:09:44,040
And we're going to put more money in the
military and we're going to reactivate

158
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:48,990
these bases. And people went,
yeah, good. Why not? By the
way, you've got to remember,

159
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,400
you've got to remember too,
that

160
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:55,140
grew up where we were the boogie
man. So it's not too like, you know,

161
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:58,020
all the old people, like if you look at
the Fox News, people that are like, yeah,

162
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,450
fuck we run Roger those.
They're all comedies. Well,

163
00:10:00,451 --> 00:10:04,410
all the people in Russia are going, I know
the Americans eat the babies, you know,

164
00:10:04,411 --> 00:10:07,650
and, and so it's not that
much of a stretch. Well,

165
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:10,650
and if you look at like
the way we behave abroad,

166
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:13,170
I mean the fact that we
have multiple wars going on,

167
00:10:13,171 --> 00:10:15,120
that we have a drone on their,
on their border,

168
00:10:15,121 --> 00:10:18,060
we look scary as fuck to say
outside of us. Remember that?

169
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:22,110
Remember that sting song? Uh, the
Russians love their children too. Yeah.

170
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:26,160
He's a great song. Yeah. Yeah. I remember
listening to that song and thinking,

171
00:10:26,161 --> 00:10:30,030
was it Stinger? The police might
have been, I think it was staying.

172
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:33,690
I think it was when his sounds like
staying, but it was the era of the police.

173
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:37,290
Yeah. Um, and he was, I mean,

174
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:42,330
we thought of them like that
there was going to kill everybody.

175
00:10:42,331 --> 00:10:43,890
It was through this going
to be a nuclear war.

176
00:10:43,891 --> 00:10:47,730
The Russians were going to kill anybody.
It hovered over our head all the time.

177
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,060
Well, you and I grew up at the end of
the Cold War when it was still full on.

178
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,190
Yeah.
It's propaganda shit.

179
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:58,080
You ever watched like war games and
like that was just a given. Yeah,

180
00:10:58,081 --> 00:11:00,630
of course we're going to destroy each
other. It's just a matter of time.

181
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,870
And then when you get to school and you
find out about the Cuban missile crisis

182
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:08,460
and go, wait, but how close was
that? Oh fuck man. Wait a minute.

183
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:13,830
What we're going to go to nuclear
war with? For what? Yeah. Holy Shit.

184
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,580
The idea is that that almost
happened or could sprays up and,

185
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:21,200
or even like step one and a three
step process of happening. Yeah.

186
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,160
It's completely

187
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,470
Leah Insane. And we had this small
interim of sanity where we all went,

188
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,160
those guys were crazy. It's a good
thing. We're not like that anymore.

189
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:34,210
And now we're going. Yeah, we still
have all those warheads pointed at them.

190
00:11:34,211 --> 00:11:37,540
They still have all those warheads pointed
it at us. And you're like, well, why?

191
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:42,340
It really is amazing if you think about
how long people have been alive for,

192
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:47,550
it really is amazing that we've only
dropped two nuclear bombs since 1947 yeah,

193
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,460
I mean just those two. Yeah. And
that was it. Well, there were bad,

194
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:56,110
so they scared the shit out of that.
But everything else we keep doing,

195
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:58,120
everything else is fucked up.
We keep doing it.

196
00:11:58,121 --> 00:12:02,680
But that was the one thing that we ever
did that was so brutal and so real.

197
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:07,360
There was no way of
morally like rationalize.

198
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:13,030
Well, even us at our craziest, and even
the Russians at their craziest, you know,

199
00:12:13,031 --> 00:12:17,440
we never did it, but the problem is is
we were rational actors. We were like,

200
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:20,260
even if we hated each other,
and even if there was propaganda,

201
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,990
we're still rational actors.
The problem,

202
00:12:22,991 --> 00:12:25,570
the worry is you have irrational actors,

203
00:12:25,571 --> 00:12:30,571
like Pakistan has over a hundred war
warheads and they're rapidly becoming an

204
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:35,650
irrational act because they're losing
control over their country to the Taliban

205
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:39,820
who you know, who, who are are,

206
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:44,680
whose agenda is clearly stated
that they want to fuck us up.

207
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:48,640
So I mean that's, that's where it
gets terrified, but we shouldn't,

208
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:51,210
it's the New Year Joe. We
shouldn't start. We should get,

209
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:54,220
we shouldn't get straight into like,
you know,

210
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:59,440
and w and the vector for war had
number six one seven nine is Carmel,

211
00:12:59,861 --> 00:13:00,694
California.

212
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:04,330
I had these conversations with you more
than anybody I know because you're the

213
00:13:04,331 --> 00:13:07,370
one that you're the one who actually
goes to these fucking places. You,

214
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:11,320
you actually go, well I will say creepy,
scary spots and coming back with news.

215
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,990
But you know,
I used to be afraid of,

216
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:17,410
of why know I go with all these war
zones and I still am. But you know,

217
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,050
war is bad. Everyone always says, well,

218
00:13:20,051 --> 00:13:23,380
we go to war and they picture sort of
manly GI Joe type shooting each other and

219
00:13:23,381 --> 00:13:24,880
it generally doesn't look like that.

220
00:13:24,881 --> 00:13:29,110
It's lots of collateral damage and women
and children being fucking blown to

221
00:13:29,111 --> 00:13:33,010
shit and then guys go in there and
get PTSD and get their ass shot off.

222
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:38,440
But you know, the thing is, is one of the
things that I recently came back from,

223
00:13:38,441 --> 00:13:40,140
it fucked me up. Like really? I mean,

224
00:13:40,141 --> 00:13:43,730
now I'm to the point where I'm having
a kind of an existential crisis going,

225
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:48,340
well, what's it all mean is I went to
the South Pole because we did this,

226
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:53,290
we did this piece on Greenland melting,
which one is the Emmy last year?

227
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,990
We got a lot of uh, uh, whatever, uh,

228
00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:01,000
discussion around it on both sides
of, of the, uh, of the debate.

229
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:03,790
Although why it's a fucking
debate, I don't know. But anyway,

230
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:05,800
the Arctic is melting.
One of the things that's happening,

231
00:14:05,801 --> 00:14:09,120
the reason why the Cold War is heating
up again as the, under the Arctic ice,

232
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:12,370
there's tons of oil and gas and Russia
doesn't have any other money besides oil

233
00:14:12,371 --> 00:14:16,060
and gas. The Russia literally went
put the flag in the Arctic Circle.

234
00:14:16,061 --> 00:14:18,670
We talked to the guy who did it and said,
well we own all this.

235
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:21,580
Now we're taking all the oil and gas.
Of course,

236
00:14:21,581 --> 00:14:24,880
every country that borders them as a
NATO country and if you attack one you

237
00:14:24,881 --> 00:14:28,090
attack them all. So this is why the Cold
War, heating it up. People are afraid.

238
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:32,170
Any who. So we go to the Arctic
is melting. Greenland is melting.

239
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:34,990
Everyone now is like, yeah, yeah, okay
we'll give you, that will give you,

240
00:14:34,991 --> 00:14:39,910
Greenland is melting in the Arctic melting
but Antarctica is actually gaining in

241
00:14:39,911 --> 00:14:44,440
ice. So like it's kind of evening its
self out, which is crazy to begin with.

242
00:14:44,441 --> 00:14:48,070
But we're like okay,
instead of saying you're crazy,

243
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,140
we're going to say okay fuck it,
we'll go,

244
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:54,320
we'll go down and we'll see what the
fuck it is. So we go down with NASA,

245
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:59,240
we go down with, you know, the top
scientists in the world from, I mean from,

246
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,280
from well from about
20 different countries.

247
00:15:01,281 --> 00:15:04,380
But the top guy is a French
guy and we go to the,

248
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:08,350
to the South Pole and we're
like, so, so, so the, you know,

249
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:14,480
Arctic is melting and
Greenland is melting, but
Antarctica is not like we have,

250
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:16,820
we have ice gain and they're like,

251
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:22,130
you're fucking stupid. Like
what the fuck? And because what,

252
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:26,000
what was happening was their
sea ice, right? Which is like,

253
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,780
like if it's like a lake
freezes and then it melts,

254
00:15:29,781 --> 00:15:33,420
it freezes and it melts and the lake
doesn't go up or down because it's ours.

255
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:34,400
It's the same water.

256
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:38,420
It's like an ice cube that's already
in the glass just melted. It doesn't

257
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:45,020
land ice old die. The shit that's melting.
It's like putting new ice in the glass.

258
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:48,830
Right? So it overflowed that sea
level rise. So they're like, yeah,

259
00:15:48,831 --> 00:15:53,630
there's CIS gain on this side
and on this side, the sea,

260
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:56,780
the sea ice is the shit that doesn't
matter. I don't know this side land.

261
00:15:56,781 --> 00:15:58,760
Ice Is fucking melting
as fast as it can go.

262
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:02,960
Land Rights is a scary shit because
land ice is the adding the new water in.

263
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:07,100
So that sea level rise. That's
glaciers. Glaciers. Exactly.

264
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:09,890
So I go down there and I go with
all these different scientists.

265
00:16:09,891 --> 00:16:14,150
I go on planes with lasers and radars
to fucking measure everything and all

266
00:16:14,151 --> 00:16:18,200
these dudes and scientists and everyone
like, oh fuck yeah, like, like board,

267
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,500
like yeah, it's a given. He has a
mounting, it's going to melt. We're done.

268
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:23,300
We're going to fucking mouth.
And we're like,

269
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,060
well,

270
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,690
why don't we know about that? And
they're like, well we do, I mean,

271
00:16:27,691 --> 00:16:30,720
we published the reports, published the
data NASA published today. That's fine.

272
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:33,320
Bob Is the data. And you're like, um,

273
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,800
I'm a guy who does this for a living
and I don't know this shit. Like,

274
00:16:37,801 --> 00:16:41,760
why the fuck? So you know, we got the
top scientists and we went to the thing,

275
00:16:41,761 --> 00:16:44,820
whatever. And they're like, yeah, oh
fuck yeah, it's going to be at, you know,

276
00:16:44,821 --> 00:16:48,030
three meters, four meters. And, and
at that point you're like, well,

277
00:16:48,031 --> 00:16:52,410
that remaps the world. Shouldn't we be
making a bigger fucking deal about this?

278
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:56,940
Because you know, and I always get shit
for shit talking about it. I'm not,

279
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,380
you know me,
I'm not a tree hugger.

280
00:16:58,381 --> 00:17:02,610
I'm a fucking beer drinking
football stuff and staking guy.

281
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,190
But when I see shit like this,
I go,

282
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:06,710
uh,

283
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:09,000
why the fuck aren't we
freaking the fuck out?

284
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:13,380
Because all the wars in the world don't
matter if we add three or four meters of

285
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:17,690
sea level rise. So don't get anything
on the ocean in Malibu. Don't do that.

286
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,900
That what you're saying is
that the hidden message here?

287
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:24,750
Well if you do sell it within five years,

288
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,000
dude's that live in those stilt houses.

289
00:17:27,001 --> 00:17:30,930
Like how confident are you that the
ocean is not going to take your place?

290
00:17:30,931 --> 00:17:34,650
Man Tilts into the sand.
Oh, tanker didn't cement.

291
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:40,560
That's going to stop the ocean.
The ocean anyway. How much quicker?

292
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:44,940
We don't have to get into this year's.
We're backing into doom and gloom,

293
00:17:44,941 --> 00:17:48,270
but it's okay the it's
going so got some water.

294
00:17:48,271 --> 00:17:52,260
Good IBCC report.
Well the one thing is is we won't,

295
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:55,880
it looks like a lot of people won't
die because they'll move, right? We,

296
00:17:56,180 --> 00:18:01,110
we have legs and we can move. We can build
new cities and shit. The problem is, is,

297
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:04,620
you know, we, we, we, we go
to Antarctica and all these,

298
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,800
they're all scientists are all dudes
and they're like either, you know,

299
00:18:07,801 --> 00:18:11,720
very clinical, I guess Robert lose three
meters and meanness and listen to this.

300
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,900
And then you go to Bangladesh, which is
sort of at sea level and they're just,

301
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:16,680
you know,

302
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:20,370
I think last year alone there was like
20 million climate change migrants.

303
00:18:20,371 --> 00:18:25,020
So then you go to the city and it's
just, I mean it's fucking, you know,

304
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:28,550
it's just everything breaks
down. Nothing works. Just, just,

305
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,830
there's 20 million people in the city
that's built for 2 million people.

306
00:18:31,831 --> 00:18:36,300
It's just, it's, it's just
crazy. And you're like, when
do you see it? You Go, oh,

307
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,230
rich people or whatever,

308
00:18:38,231 --> 00:18:42,000
it will be able to move up the hill or
Colorado or whatever the fuck it is.

309
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:44,190
And everyone else is just like,
well,

310
00:18:44,191 --> 00:18:47,550
you guys have to stay in the garbage
heaps and see how you, how you can do it.

311
00:18:47,551 --> 00:18:52,200
And when, when, when you see it going
forward. Like, I'm a, I'm a positive guy.

312
00:18:52,201 --> 00:18:53,310
I believe things you know,

313
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,120
genuinely have gotten better throughout
history and quality of life has gotten

314
00:18:57,121 --> 00:19:01,950
better and health has gotten better and
all this shit. But you know, you're,

315
00:19:01,951 --> 00:19:03,540
you're basically saying,
well,

316
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:08,670
if there's going to be
hundreds of millions of people
forced to move because of

317
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:11,490
this,
then that's going to cause chaos.

318
00:19:11,491 --> 00:19:16,491
Chaos generally isn't good for anyone
who is a young 20 year old dude with a

319
00:19:18,121 --> 00:19:21,680
club in his hand, you know? Yeah.
And even him, it's really not.

320
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:26,640
It's good for him for a bit. Tell
somebody with a bigger club, fuck.

321
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:31,660
Take a person who's better at hitting
what is the longest pipeline we have as

322
00:19:31,861 --> 00:19:34,260
far as oil.
Like I know there's,

323
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:38,970
that's one of the issues that keystone
pipeline when you're trying to get oil

324
00:19:38,971 --> 00:19:42,390
all the way from Alaska,
right? Yeah. I mean,

325
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:46,740
my question being, why can't we do that
with ice? With all the water's draining,

326
00:19:46,741 --> 00:19:48,990
just pumping into cal
California needs water.

327
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:53,460
Just bring a pipeline of water down here
and just spray that stupid death valley

328
00:19:53,461 --> 00:19:58,010
area. That area is stupid. Let's turn
death valley into a forest. You know,

329
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:01,590
you can. Yes, you can do that.
But that would be the shit.

330
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:04,440
But then it's the ice,

331
00:20:04,441 --> 00:20:08,100
it still gets in and the
SI tables still whatever.

332
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,990
Just by fucking real estate in Greenland.
Right.

333
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:14,940
Cause it's kind of two people are doing
lush tropical people are actually,

334
00:20:14,941 --> 00:20:18,750
well mining companies because you
couldn't get to the, to the land before.

335
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:21,630
Now that mining companies are buying it
all up because of the ice has melted.

336
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:25,200
When was it named? He was it, was it
named Greenland ironically or was it yeah,

337
00:20:25,201 --> 00:20:26,070
that's a good point.

338
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:31,460
It was named that because it was Iceland
and Greenland and they switched the

339
00:20:31,621 --> 00:20:35,400
names because I believe it
was Leif Ericson or Erik,

340
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:39,360
the Red Leif Erickson or one of the
reds. One of Erickson's. Anyway,

341
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:42,780
he went there and he didn't want people
cause he wanted it to be his own.

342
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:48,100
So he named Iceland, Iceland
and Greenland. Greenland
to freak them out. Okay.

343
00:20:48,101 --> 00:20:51,550
So the went to Greenland looking for
what the fuck. Everything is nice.

344
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,820
Then he Iceland's the sweet spot.
Iceland's the sweet spot.

345
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:58,720
That is a good spot to his, if I can give
some love the documentaries on Iceland,

346
00:20:58,721 --> 00:20:59,920
you guys did one on the Iceland.

347
00:20:59,921 --> 00:21:04,120
Strong men fucking dude's to
just carry rocks around up there.

348
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:07,180
They're ridiculous people.
There's some crazy genetics going on.

349
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:12,220
I got to move there. I was just
going to move. They're big.

350
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:15,760
They're big motherfucker so big. They're
like freakish, like cartoon for date.

351
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:19,930
But what's weird about it is that there's
a ton of them. It's not like one dude,

352
00:21:19,931 --> 00:21:23,470
one genetic anomaly could lift
the fucking car above his head.

353
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,830
It's like there's 17 of them that all
the strongest dudes in the world are all

354
00:21:26,831 --> 00:21:29,020
from one fucking tiny little place.

355
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:32,020
They all have those crazy fucking
names too that are really difficult to

356
00:21:32,021 --> 00:21:35,630
pronounce.
There's always a magnus in there

357
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:40,990
from the late, you know, there's so,
there's so much, but I guess they are.

358
00:21:40,991 --> 00:21:41,711
I mean it makes sense.

359
00:21:41,711 --> 00:21:46,240
They're like this descendants of vikings
and certainly they just lift shit all

360
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,240
day while they're just
manly. It's fun. I mean,

361
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:51,660
if you're the descendants of the,

362
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,090
some of the greatest conquerors in
the most part, parent conquers ever.

363
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,900
It's just that genetics doesn't just stop.
It's also fucking,

364
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:03,220
even if they're not in jail, like
whoever lived or whoever was like the,

365
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:05,410
the product of sex with one of those men,

366
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,810
like if those women lived
and their children lived,

367
00:22:07,811 --> 00:22:09,070
even if the Viking didn't live,

368
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:11,500
that's like you're talking about
some insane genetics problem.

369
00:22:11,501 --> 00:22:14,920
It's also not like la or, or
you know, let's say Panama,

370
00:22:14,921 --> 00:22:17,800
we can pick the bananas off the trees.
Like to live in Iceland,

371
00:22:17,801 --> 00:22:19,000
you gotta be tough as fuck.

372
00:22:19,001 --> 00:22:23,750
You got to go out on freezing cold water
and like stab a cod. The spirit. Yeah.

373
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:27,430
Like it's, it's hard. It's,
it's cold and forbidding.

374
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:30,580
You got to learn how to drive in the
ice. Yeah. It's fun as hell though.

375
00:22:30,581 --> 00:22:33,520
I love Iceland. It's a great,
but I love Greenland actually.

376
00:22:33,521 --> 00:22:37,390
I went there and was blown
away by how beautiful it was.

377
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:40,330
Did you eat that shark dish that they
have that's supposed to be disgusting,

378
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:45,190
that fermented, fermented puffin? I
believe that what it is. Yeah. Yeah. No,

379
00:22:45,191 --> 00:22:47,500
I did. No, I'm not into
fuck. You know, I'm not like,

380
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,580
my thing is to go to weird countries and,

381
00:22:50,581 --> 00:22:54,080
and shoot the newsy but not eat the
shit because I get the shit to anyways.

382
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:56,560
So if I'm eating fermented puffing,
I'm like,

383
00:22:56,561 --> 00:23:00,280
I'm not getting on that plane gets
a shark dish. It's maybe it's a,

384
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:01,810
I know they have,
maybe it's a pickle.

385
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,260
I know they have fermented puffin and
it's the most disgusting fucking thing in

386
00:23:05,261 --> 00:23:10,090
the world because it comes from, it comes
from Matt, Jess or whatever it's called,

387
00:23:10,091 --> 00:23:12,790
which is the fermented herring,

388
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:17,230
which they had to make illegal in
Sweden because it stank so bad.

389
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:21,490
So they made it like you can't make
it in your house or shit anymore.

390
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:25,420
You can't make it. No, it's illegal,
but it's a Swedish national did.

391
00:23:25,421 --> 00:23:27,840
They can't cause it stinks so bad.
And then,

392
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:31,540
and then instead of the fermented herring,
they did the fermented Puffin,

393
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:36,580
which I dunno, well they might do that
as well, but they do do a shark thing.

394
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,530
It's called a hot Cari.

395
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:45,800
Okay. How Carl? I guess it's
how Carl, all right. Whatever.

396
00:23:45,801 --> 00:23:49,230
I don't know how they talk. It's, it's
a very interesting pronunciation. Um,

397
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,070
but it's a Greenland shark.
Uh,

398
00:23:52,071 --> 00:23:56,120
or other sleeper shark that's been cured
with a particular fermentation process

399
00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:01,040
and hung to dry for four to five
months. It turns black. Yeah,

400
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,080
I've seen it hanging.
Oh my God.

401
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:08,230
Look up fermented puffin now you give
me my five minutes for minted puffin.

402
00:24:08,481 --> 00:24:11,330
Fermented puffing and puffing.

403
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:17,750
Puffing is the cute, it's like a
cute looking bird, I think Icelandic.

404
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:22,160
Yeah, they apparently they ferment a lot
of shit. Yeah. They ferment a puffin.

405
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:25,760
They ferment often, which is a
bird. Yeah, a cute little bird.

406
00:24:25,761 --> 00:24:30,590
And they ferment the fucker and it
reeks so bad. And then, you know,

407
00:24:30,591 --> 00:24:32,830
it's one of these things where
you have to eat it or whatever.

408
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:37,760
And I used to go out to eat it. I don't
care. And then you're just, yeah, I'm not,

409
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,380
I'm not going to eat the fermented puffin.

410
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:44,470
I think if you live in a place like
scary as far as climate and as harsh as

411
00:24:45,561 --> 00:24:49,490
Iceland, you learn how to eat fucking
everything. Puffins they just,

412
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:51,710
you know how they do what they call it?
Sky Fishing.

413
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:54,500
Apparently it says there
are hunted by sky fishing,

414
00:24:54,501 --> 00:24:57,530
which involves catching low
flying birds with a big net.

415
00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:00,290
So they just like calves,
nets in the sky.

416
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:04,280
They look all these bourbons that they
scoop up birds from the sky as they're

417
00:25:04,281 --> 00:25:08,830
flying, ferment them until they're
rotten and then eat them. Oh,

418
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,020
this is so disgusting.

419
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:16,850
They bottle it and there's all sorts of
different ways they'd cook it. Uh, but uh,

420
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:19,610
it's uh,
well smoked and cured sometimes,

421
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:24,410
but the fermented one is this disgusting.
I'm not doing the fermented toughen.

422
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:28,610
The Greenland, the one that basking
shark is what I saw Bordain eat.

423
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:33,440
And uh, it looked pretty
foul. Yeah. Oh No.

424
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:36,170
We don't want to do that.
But it's, that's must be,

425
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:38,690
develop a taste for it
because you need that protein.

426
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:41,900
There's not a lot of options. I
guess. So. I mean, I smelled the,

427
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:44,510
the fermented herring. The
Swedes do. And you're like,

428
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:49,350
it's like hardcore hardcore
ammonia and you're like, how,

429
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,800
like it's telling you not to eat it.
Like, why would the fuck would you,

430
00:25:56,730 --> 00:26:01,220
I don't know why. Yeah. I mean, what,
what happens to a person's body does that,

431
00:26:01,221 --> 00:26:04,970
like they get get they're
accustomed to it. It was like a,

432
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:09,560
I have no idea. I mean that doesn't
make any sense. I have no idea.

433
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:12,560
I mean less you're starving
and Iceland gets a plane. Oh,

434
00:26:12,561 --> 00:26:14,750
you have a weird thing like kids,
you know,

435
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:18,590
you develop your taste when you're kid and
like, you know what Natto is, you know?

436
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:21,710
No, it's like fermented
beans. Very strong taste.

437
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:25,250
Everyone in Japan eats it for breakfast,
not too, oh, delicious. Not the end.

438
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:28,160
It's like,
it's like from like rotten,

439
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:31,970
rotten sticky beans and
it's, but you know, again,

440
00:26:31,971 --> 00:26:35,390
you go there and they love it and they
eat it with a sort of strong mustard.

441
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:39,110
But um, you got a lot of
places. I remember, you know,

442
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,270
I was sick somewhere

443
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:47,190
anyway. He was somewhere, uh,
maybe it was Katmandu. Anyways,

444
00:26:47,191 --> 00:26:52,110
I was sick and they brought
me the spiciest like
craziest fucking Chili, like,

445
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:55,770
you know, Vindaloo and,
and I was like, I'm sick.

446
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:59,680
I want like a grilled cheese sandwich and
ginger rail. Like, you know, I want to,

447
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,810
and they brought me the spiciest crazy
chili shit and it, it's just, look,

448
00:27:03,811 --> 00:27:07,980
everybody has a different, I
don't know, different, you know,

449
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:12,000
comfort food or whatever when they're
sick or whatever they believe they're

450
00:27:12,001 --> 00:27:13,170
going to eat or something.
Well,

451
00:27:13,171 --> 00:27:16,780
they say that fermentation is how people
figured out how to make alcohol. Yeah.

452
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:20,010
We'll figure it out. They got drunk
from fermented things. Do you get,

453
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:23,790
is there a certain amount of intoxication
you get from those? From Amy maybe?

454
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:27,840
I Dunno, that's a good question. I know
alcohol, it was a way to transport water.

455
00:27:27,841 --> 00:27:30,060
Wine was a way to transport
water. They're like, oh,

456
00:27:30,061 --> 00:27:33,900
because a lot of places they would go to,
it was a big thing.

457
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:35,700
Anthrax was huge because the,

458
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:40,330
the animals would go to know and they
fall in the water and then the whole pond

459
00:27:40,331 --> 00:27:42,780
or the whole water source
becomes an [inaudible].

460
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:45,540
That's where anthrax
comes from. Yeah. Yeah.

461
00:27:45,541 --> 00:27:47,980
So it just comes from like
a decaying animal. Yeah.

462
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,990
And so and so it was a lot
of water was unsafe. So like,

463
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:54,690
oh we need to figure out a
way to carry water with us.

464
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:58,040
And they figured out a lot of ways,
but wine was one of them.

465
00:27:58,041 --> 00:28:01,980
One or we can carry this for you know,
years we can get of this.

466
00:28:01,981 --> 00:28:05,430
And they didn't have corks that just
put a bit of olive oil on top of it,

467
00:28:05,431 --> 00:28:07,620
which would seal it.
And I was like,

468
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:10,680
that means that if you go logically,

469
00:28:10,681 --> 00:28:12,990
they were drinking a shit pile
of wine because they were like,

470
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:15,690
well I'm not going to trust the water
cause I don't know that the animals

471
00:28:15,691 --> 00:28:20,100
haven't died in it, so I'll just drink
wine all day every day. I lived off wine.

472
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:21,110
That is hilarious.

473
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:24,990
What explains like a lot of the crazy
shit that people can get it back then just

474
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:29,900
drunk in bands of marauders going
up from hillside the hillside. Yeah.

475
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:32,070
That's really crazy.
If you stop and think about it,

476
00:28:32,071 --> 00:28:35,760
like the people that were traveling
and drinking wine and exclusively for

477
00:28:35,761 --> 00:28:36,594
hydration,

478
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:40,260
what the difference it must've been
on the way they thought and behaved.

479
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:45,400
Explains a lot of history.
It does. We're really fair.

480
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:49,440
We're figuring it all out here. Yes. We
figured out two things. I figure it out.

481
00:28:49,441 --> 00:28:53,970
We just got to get a pipeline. I'm
black man from Antarctica or Greenland,

482
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:57,510
pour that water in the palm springs
and palm desert, all that area.

483
00:28:57,511 --> 00:29:02,100
Just fucking make it a lush, lush
tropical forests. We could do that.

484
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:06,330
All right. Just how about a big pipe
and like a sprinkler system over la?

485
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:10,830
It just rains while La la needs water
magic. That's what it came down to.

486
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,070
We have artificial eggland high rail,
uh,

487
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:18,090
like shower systems over cities.
There's a rain anymore in la.

488
00:29:18,091 --> 00:29:21,390
So La decided it needed a shower system.
We'd cause a lot of,

489
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:26,400
a lot of news saying we're going to
reuse the keystone pipeline, not for oil,

490
00:29:26,401 --> 00:29:29,820
but for glaciers so that we can actually
have water. That would be bad ass.

491
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:32,970
Nobody would oppose that
pose. Moving water. Well,

492
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:35,490
if oil keeps going down
and water keeps going up,

493
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:38,730
it will be economically feasible.
You make more money selling water,

494
00:29:38,731 --> 00:29:43,420
then you will be a commodity. Yeah. Yeah.
That's the, that's the projection, right?

495
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:44,200
We're,

496
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:48,010
we're going to actually have an issue
with fresh water but then the next 50 to

497
00:29:48,011 --> 00:29:52,630
60 years or we have an issue with it now.
What will you see those lakes, Texas,

498
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:56,920
if you've been to Austin, Have Lake
Travis and Lake Austin and Lake Travis.

499
00:29:57,190 --> 00:30:01,690
They don't artificially feet like
Austin looks bad ass but lake Travis has

500
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:05,250
vanished all the uh, yeah, we
did a piece on it. All the,

501
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:09,070
the houseboats and everything are
sitting just on like not even dry land.

502
00:30:09,071 --> 00:30:12,560
Like cake, like scorched land. Yeah.

503
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:17,380
And the docs are nowhere near the water
anymore. I don't know. Hundreds of yards.

504
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:18,243
It's a weird,

505
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:22,060
it's like you will Texas but has
been in drought now for three years.

506
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:26,920
Three years as this California. Yeah. I
think there there's this worse is worse.

507
00:30:26,921 --> 00:30:29,140
Also they have a lot of
agriculture there too, right?

508
00:30:29,141 --> 00:30:33,520
They have a lot of agriculture
farm. The big thing is now the, the,

509
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:36,400
I believe the numbers are staggering.

510
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:40,760
Like one third of of beef cattle are
gone. Like, you know, like just trip,

511
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:44,100
which in Texas is a huge numbers,

512
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:46,750
millions and millions and we have
a lot of agriculture in California,

513
00:30:46,751 --> 00:30:51,100
but we have nearly as much
as Texas has. I think, uh,

514
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,180
like Louise more water.

515
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:55,810
Well I think there's more straight
up ag agriculture in California,

516
00:30:55,811 --> 00:30:59,520
but there's more uh, like
to, and Shit, you know,

517
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:02,560
there's this many tigers in
Texas is there are in the wild.

518
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:06,880
That's tragic and weird. It's
amazing. But there's, yeah,

519
00:31:06,881 --> 00:31:09,970
I mean there's not that many left in the
wild and there's a lot of crazy people

520
00:31:09,971 --> 00:31:12,700
in Texas. They want to buy
one. So it doesn't surprise me.

521
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:17,110
Texas has a huge population
of these wildlife parks.

522
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:20,930
They had a wild game parks where you
could go like shoot a zebra. Yeah.

523
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,440
With a compound bow go hunters,
zebra.

524
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:27,670
Like they have these crazy fucking
parks where they have wild animals.

525
00:31:27,671 --> 00:31:31,360
It's not just a few. There's a lot
of people have private collections.

526
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:36,190
I've heard of that. And my favorite
story is not actually in Texas, but uh,

527
00:31:36,191 --> 00:31:40,600
in, in Columbia where a
Escobar loved wild animals.

528
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,480
So he bought like hippos
and elephants and tigers.

529
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:46,330
And then when it all went to shit,

530
00:31:46,331 --> 00:31:51,331
they just went into the jungle and
they're just procreating and living and

531
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:55,840
you're like, it's kind of, that's
kind of cool actually, you know? Yeah.

532
00:31:55,880 --> 00:32:00,130
Probably environmentally. They're not
supposed to have elephants and in,

533
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,270
in Columbia. But uh, having the, the,

534
00:32:03,271 --> 00:32:08,140
the animals sort of set free into the wild
is I think, I think it was good. Yeah.

535
00:32:08,141 --> 00:32:09,070
Well there's,
um,

536
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:14,580
there's a lot of people in this
country that have private collections.

537
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:19,450
They have one animals. There was the guy
that lived in Ohio. He opened his gates,

538
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:24,490
let all of his animals out, and then blew
his brains out. No cops, cops showed up.

539
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,770
And you know,
there's all these wild animals,

540
00:32:26,771 --> 00:32:28,870
including is dangerous
ones like lions and shit.

541
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:31,000
So these cops have to shoot these animals.

542
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:34,060
They can't even save him because he
can't let them go out into the wild,

543
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,890
not wild cities, suburban
neighborhood. It's close.

544
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,010
So then I just

545
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:43,760
wind up shooting all of them. But
it's, this guy was fucking crazy.

546
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:46,550
But you can just do that.
You can have tigers in your yard.

547
00:32:46,551 --> 00:32:49,820
Like Mike Tyson had a tiger.
Like you can have a tiger.

548
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:54,410
Like that is insane. Like there
needs to be a law on that. Like that,

549
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:56,710
that's more ridiculous than guns.

550
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,860
No more tigers left in the world.
But you know,

551
00:32:59,861 --> 00:33:03,140
Joe blow down in Dallas comes
inside like a tiger, send me,

552
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:07,390
listen son. I got the healthiest tag
or community and all of North America,

553
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:12,040
he's here. Tigers. These are direct
from India. I don't fuck with them.

554
00:33:12,041 --> 00:33:15,970
Siberian tigers. There's
slower. Okay. They're lazy.

555
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:19,330
They don't kill. Yeah. There's a,

556
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:23,590
there's a ton of wild game
parks in Texas where they,

557
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:28,060
they took a lot of animals that were
almost extinct in Asia and now they're

558
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:31,840
thriving. And today's,
yeah. Species of deer.

559
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:36,640
Like there's many species of deer that
they have that they take from other

560
00:33:36,641 --> 00:33:40,570
countries. Uh, and they bring to America
and they put them in his game parks,

561
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:44,170
especially in Texas. And then they can
hunt them anytime they want. Right, right.

562
00:33:44,171 --> 00:33:47,170
Because they become like a
commodity instead of it being like,

563
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:49,500
there's seasons for deer
and the season for it.

564
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,070
There's seasons for everything else,

565
00:33:51,071 --> 00:33:54,490
but these animals that are non
[inaudible] non native, yeah.

566
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:55,660
Get on them anytime you want.

567
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:58,480
So they bring them over there just
specifically for that purpose,

568
00:33:58,481 --> 00:34:02,100
but so they're thriving because they're
worth something. Right, right, right.

569
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:04,750
She's really kind of trippy
know. It's like, yeah,

570
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:06,730
you want the animals to be thriving.

571
00:34:06,731 --> 00:34:10,300
But it's kind of weird that the only way
they're thriving is if dudes to get out

572
00:34:10,301 --> 00:34:11,230
there and shoot.
But

573
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:16,460
this is, you know, not a, uh,
a tremendously popular, uh,

574
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:20,810
um, sort of argument, but it
actually makes a lot of sense.

575
00:34:20,811 --> 00:34:25,720
Like when we did this piece
on, um, a rhino poaching,

576
00:34:25,721 --> 00:34:26,060
you know,
they,

577
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:29,420
they killed the rhino just for the horn
because they sell it in Vietnam as an

578
00:34:29,421 --> 00:34:30,254
aphrodisiac.

579
00:34:30,890 --> 00:34:35,090
And the guy who is trying to
save the rhinos is saying,

580
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:39,500
you know, legalize it and we'll take the
horns off. Cause you can take the whole,

581
00:34:39,501 --> 00:34:43,070
it's like, it's made it like,
it's like to hair. Yeah.

582
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:47,540
You can take the horn off and we'll just
sell it and then therefore they don't

583
00:34:47,541 --> 00:34:49,220
have to kill the rhinos for the horn.

584
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,970
It'll just be a market and everyone's
freaking out saying, no, no, no, but,

585
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:58,130
but as long as dudes who are poor can
make a ton of money for killing thing to

586
00:34:59,601 --> 00:35:04,520
take the horn, they will. Whereas if
you just say, okay, well, you know,

587
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,970
we'll give you the fucking horn and you
can do whatever they want you to have as

588
00:35:07,971 --> 00:35:09,680
many voters as you want,
go nuts.

589
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:13,220
That's the only way to save them
is capitalism is killing them.

590
00:35:13,221 --> 00:35:16,040
So capitalism has to save them.
And initially you go,

591
00:35:16,041 --> 00:35:20,540
well that doesn't sound right,
but when you think about
it, you're like, well, okay.

592
00:35:20,541 --> 00:35:24,080
Yeah. Then the problem is,
well somebody will be like,

593
00:35:24,081 --> 00:35:27,200
someone will regulate
it and like a company,

594
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:31,160
GM will make the money out
of the illegal rhino horns,

595
00:35:31,161 --> 00:35:34,400
but they'll still be illegal
rhino horns because the,

596
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,980
the guys will get disenfranchising.
They'll get screwed out

597
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,570
of it somehow.
But in any way,

598
00:35:39,571 --> 00:35:43,710
the argument that you have to make it
as economically viable to do the thing

599
00:35:43,711 --> 00:35:45,750
because otherwise they'll
just kill to get killed out.

600
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:50,160
[inaudible] massive rhino horns really
did give you a hard on rhinos would have

601
00:35:50,161 --> 00:35:52,870
been extinct a long fucking time
ago for it to really work. Well,

602
00:35:52,871 --> 00:35:53,641
the other thing is,

603
00:35:53,641 --> 00:35:56,400
is like you're like rhino horns give
you a hard on and whatever. You're like,

604
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:58,560
just fucking buy Viagra.

605
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:03,600
Cialis 99 cents is a lot
cheaper because it's expensive.

606
00:36:04,651 --> 00:36:07,290
It's like 20 grand for a piece
of rhino and you're like,

607
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:11,640
you get fucking a vat of Viagra for that.
You could bathe in Viagra.

608
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:16,740
The rest of it all day, every
day. Like, what the fuck?

609
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:20,960
It's 20 grand. So expensive. It's crazy.

610
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:25,180
But it doesn't do anything. It's just
like eating someone's hair. Yeah. I mean,

611
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,500
similar. I'm going to grind a fingernail
and I'm going to grind up the hair and

612
00:36:28,501 --> 00:36:33,450
fingernails and uh, and
that's gonna get me hard. But,

613
00:36:33,451 --> 00:36:38,130
but, but seriously,
like just take fucking,

614
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:42,780
they bootleg Viagra for like a penny,
you know what I mean? Anyway. Well,

615
00:36:42,781 --> 00:36:47,750
they also put it in those a boner pills
that you buy at gas stations. Like they,

616
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:52,460
those boner pills that you put
Viagra, they put the Rhino Horn. No,

617
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:53,440
they put via those,

618
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:57,440
those boner pills itself for like three
95 for like a little packet. You know,

619
00:36:57,730 --> 00:36:59,980
I don't want to go try him. I don't
know. I don't know those ones.

620
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:03,090
Ben Takes Him all the time. That's a
fucking freak. He's always buying them.

621
00:37:03,091 --> 00:37:03,391
And I'm like,

622
00:37:03,391 --> 00:37:06,350
why won't you just buy real Viagara
we know what the fuck you're taking.

623
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:09,570
Taking this crazy shit
from this gas station.

624
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:14,400
You know what's called red hot super
deck, you know, but a gel. I got two back,

625
00:37:14,401 --> 00:37:17,370
just red hot super deck. What's it?
Um, I don't know, but the shit works.

626
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:21,270
That's no worst. That's no better than
eating Rhino Horn. That's just, well,

627
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:24,210
it's no better than eating
garbage you find on the street.

628
00:37:24,211 --> 00:37:28,200
But we did another piece on that that I
found fascinating because I didn't know

629
00:37:28,201 --> 00:37:31,880
anything about it, was that,
you know, you have a, you know,

630
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,630
like first of all bath salts,
you know,

631
00:37:33,631 --> 00:37:36,960
people were like fucking and then
eating each other and like I fucking,

632
00:37:36,961 --> 00:37:41,710
while they eat them and I'm
like, what, what are they
doing? How do they have bath?

633
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:45,450
Like bath salts? And they're like, what's
not, they're not fucking bath salts.

634
00:37:45,451 --> 00:37:46,680
He called them bath salts,

635
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:51,390
but you can buy them in the corner store
and now they have like their legal,

636
00:37:51,391 --> 00:37:55,420
you know, they have fake cannabinoids
or they have fake, uh, uh,

637
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:58,710
whatever other kinds of chemicals
or get you high, whatever.

638
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:02,970
And what happened was in New Zealand,
um,

639
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:05,850
math was such a huge problem that they,

640
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,410
that they went to the government and said,

641
00:38:07,411 --> 00:38:10,980
let's make like a healthier
version of math or you know, seed.

642
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:15,960
But like with, just with chem,
like real chemicals and stuff.

643
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:20,340
And so they did, they illegally
made, you know, drugs,

644
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:24,600
pills and the math problem went down.
And you know,

645
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:27,420
they were healthier version
of drugs or whatever,

646
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:32,910
but they were like selling them next to
like chocolate bars and shit. So the, the,

647
00:38:32,911 --> 00:38:36,160
the, you know, the moms and
everybody went, well, this is not

648
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:40,660
cool that you can buy math next to the
chocolate bars. Quite rightly. And,

649
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,370
and they,
so they banned them again.

650
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:47,430
But what happened was online you can go
and just change the molecule and before

651
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:52,990
the DEA, you know, get catch
up. You just change it again.

652
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:58,320
And in China they have these companies
where you can just email them saying d to

653
00:38:58,461 --> 00:39:02,290
the power of seven. And they're like,
right, I'll send you 10 kilos tomorrow.

654
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,170
So it comes in,
they just mix it up,

655
00:39:05,171 --> 00:39:08,710
put it in a package of Scooby doo
and the cover and say, there you go.

656
00:39:08,711 --> 00:39:12,760
And you can sell them legally until
you have to change the molecule again.

657
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:16,860
And there's like the, the, you know, you,
you, you smoke these things, his snoring,

658
00:39:16,861 --> 00:39:21,370
me do whatever and they're fucking
so strong, like crazy strong.

659
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:26,080
And, and here's me mister hipster going,
I didn't even know that fucking existed.

660
00:39:26,081 --> 00:39:31,081
You can walk into any corner store
and buy these off the rack and just go

661
00:39:31,091 --> 00:39:33,850
outside into the back and,
and go to Neptune.

662
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:37,030
And have they,

663
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:39,510
they've made it illegal
in a few different states.

664
00:39:39,511 --> 00:39:42,840
But the problem is they
have to specify what exactly

665
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:45,200
go it and they just alter a thing.

666
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:47,780
And then there's a new wave and then
they alter a thing and then there's,

667
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:52,010
and bath salts was, uh, somebody
put the wrong molecule in there.

668
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:53,840
And we decided that we were getting eat,

669
00:39:53,841 --> 00:39:58,340
somebody knows off as we were having
sex and that was one of the side effects

670
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:03,940
might experience sexual addiction
and cannibalism simultaneously.

671
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:06,730
My favorite drug reaction ever was there.

672
00:40:06,731 --> 00:40:10,210
There's a drug called
reequip and re equipped.

673
00:40:10,211 --> 00:40:13,630
They were given to people that suffer
from Parkinson's degree. Oh Shit.

674
00:40:13,631 --> 00:40:16,540
Parkinson's syndrome. And
uh, they gave it to this guy,

675
00:40:16,541 --> 00:40:21,541
I think it was in Dublin and it turned
him into a gay sex and junkie and a

676
00:40:23,411 --> 00:40:24,340
gambling junkie.

677
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:29,350
The guy all of a sudden became
gay from this Parkinson's disease,

678
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:34,390
started having risky gay sex with a man,
like leaving ads to meet, meet up places,

679
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:37,690
meeting guys and having sex with him.
Had no idea we were in gambling,

680
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:39,100
couldn't stop gambling.

681
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:41,920
Like it was just completely
addicted to gambling all day long.

682
00:40:41,921 --> 00:40:45,070
You just wanted to gamble
and won in court. The,

683
00:40:45,071 --> 00:40:48,610
the American equivalent of
somewhere around $600,000

684
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:53,400
really proved that it was just him going,
fuck it.

685
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:57,930
I gotta get out of jail free card. I'm
going for the full blue bull goose loony.

686
00:40:57,931 --> 00:41:01,830
I'm buckets it seems like. Right? Yeah.
I've always wanted just fucking random.

687
00:41:01,831 --> 00:41:05,790
I'm taking a weird pill. Get
out of jail free. Here we go.

688
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:10,420
Let my freak flag fly. Yeah. I wonder
like how much do you have to prove? Yeah,

689
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:14,470
when a case like that because it
was against Glaxo Smith Kline.

690
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:17,310
Yeah, you got it. A big pharmacy,
you've got to think he had a pretty,

691
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:19,680
a pretty good case cause
they would shut him down.

692
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:22,500
It has to be locked down tight.
He could never,

693
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:27,960
you can never have ever played cards or
looked at a dick before and then all of

694
00:41:27,961 --> 00:41:32,070
a sudden it was just like boom. He was
living in a different country though.

695
00:41:32,071 --> 00:41:34,010
They might have different
standards as far as like

696
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:38,390
what they think, you know, pharmaceutical
drug companies responsible for,

697
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:41,000
well it's Ireland, so
there's really, yeah,

698
00:41:41,001 --> 00:41:45,770
I'm pretty sure it was Ireland for a few
Bob. Yeah. What a crazy story though.

699
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:47,990
You never imagined being a normal guy.

700
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:52,190
All of a sudden you just can't stop
fucking playing cards at gay orgies.

701
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:54,350
Just like,
it's just all day.

702
00:41:54,351 --> 00:41:58,640
Your life is consumed with
Dick dice and just woo,

703
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:03,480
come on. Give me that.
Just a constant chaos of,

704
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:06,260
of, you know, you should
be in sales. Um, you know,

705
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:10,970
that just sounds like a good time.
Uh,

706
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:15,500
reequip case x trial. We'll find
out where the fuck this was. Yeah.

707
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:20,600
Yeah. The guy was a gifted, it's
on ABC News, man. Wow. Yeah.

708
00:42:20,970 --> 00:42:25,760
Uh, Parkington medication made him a
gibbet addicted to gambling and gay sex.

709
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:31,970
Jesus. Oh my God. It's hilarious.

710
00:42:31,971 --> 00:42:35,840
He was from France. So the whole
stories now suspect. I'm so sorry.

711
00:42:35,841 --> 00:42:40,690
I brought this up to you folks. For sure.
That guy was just making it up. Yeah.

712
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:44,030
Fucked up. What's happening in France
right now. Yeah. That's a second.

713
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:47,480
Somehow fucked up. Yeah. Well,
we went from funny to, yeah,

714
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:50,060
we talked when we went dark.
You know what's really not funny?

715
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:54,440
I've actually seen people that are taking
this very interesting stance on this

716
00:42:54,441 --> 00:42:58,680
story. Um, the whole story,
if you don't know what it is,

717
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:02,910
how do you say the name of the paper?
Charlie. Charlie Hebdo Abdo. Um,

718
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:07,940
they made the satire cartoons
about Mohammed and about Islam and,

719
00:43:10,681 --> 00:43:14,610
uh, they were murdered. 10
people, two police officers,

720
00:43:14,611 --> 00:43:18,540
12 people were murdered by
these, uh, Islamic hit people.

721
00:43:18,541 --> 00:43:22,320
And there's been all these protests
and France and all these marches and

722
00:43:22,321 --> 00:43:23,580
everybody's freaking out worldwide.

723
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:28,820
But I've seen some people take the stance
that those cartoons were offensive and

724
00:43:29,461 --> 00:43:33,090
they, they were punching down
at that. That was sad to her.

725
00:43:33,091 --> 00:43:37,890
They were punching down and that those,
those cartoons were racist. And that,

726
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:40,980
you know, don't they understand
that it's offensive. I read this,

727
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:45,750
a tweet actually don't they understand
that it's offensive not just to Muslims

728
00:43:45,751 --> 00:43:48,570
but to one quarter of
the people on the planet.

729
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:52,830
That was what they wrote
as if that in any way,

730
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,340
like when do we put our foot
down and say, look, you're,

731
00:43:56,341 --> 00:43:57,680
I know you're a tolerant person.

732
00:43:57,710 --> 00:44:00,000
Whoever's saying this is that
you're trying to preach tolerance.

733
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:04,260
You're talking about tolerance
for something that kills people,

734
00:44:04,261 --> 00:44:07,620
that draw tunes,
like look,

735
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:09,443
Charlie Hebdo and,

736
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:14,490
and cartoons and humor in general is
meant to be a mirror onto ourselves.

737
00:44:14,491 --> 00:44:17,820
And you know, we take ourselves
so seriously. And when you start,

738
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:21,300
I believe if you start any type
of censorship, you're fucked.

739
00:44:21,330 --> 00:44:25,050
Because when you know somebody won't
like something and then the other person

740
00:44:25,051 --> 00:44:26,310
won't like the thing that you like.

741
00:44:26,311 --> 00:44:30,720
And once you start down that path
and you say, well, you know Joe,

742
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:35,100
you know, uh, I hate that you know that
you like, you know, Palestine. Well Shane,

743
00:44:35,101 --> 00:44:37,830
I hate to, you're like Israel.
Whatever it is, someone's always,

744
00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:40,260
always going to have.
And the minute someone gets that,

745
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:44,100
then censorship starts in the minute
censorship starts. It never stops.

746
00:44:44,130 --> 00:44:48,780
First of all, censorship by
fear. And we were just, you know,

747
00:44:48,781 --> 00:44:52,680
we started the whole conversation about
this censorship by fear was Nazi Germany,

748
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:56,340
censorship by fear with Stalinists Russia.
Censorship by fear was mad.

749
00:44:56,341 --> 00:45:01,260
I was China. And if you wrote or thought
or said anything against the state,

750
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:02,340
you got killed.

751
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:07,320
And now what we're saying is if you
do or say or do anything against a

752
00:45:07,321 --> 00:45:12,030
perceived, you know, thing
about a religion, then
they're going to come get you.

753
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:14,190
Right? And people were
like, terrified, oh my God,

754
00:45:14,191 --> 00:45:16,740
we're not going to show the
cartoons. We're not going
to show, we're not going to,

755
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:21,130
what do you think you can like that?
There's that many terrorists out there,

756
00:45:21,131 --> 00:45:24,210
they're going to kill everybody
who retweets a fucking cartoon.

757
00:45:24,211 --> 00:45:28,350
And that's the insidiousness
of, of, of, of,

758
00:45:28,410 --> 00:45:31,740
of terrorism. Because then you're
like, if you make fun of anything,

759
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:36,840
if you make fun of any political leader
or political group or terrorist group or

760
00:45:36,841 --> 00:45:40,650
anyone with a gun, they get can,
can of, can come out and shoot you.

761
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:45,950
And I think that's the whole
thing of like, uh, no, they're
allowed to fucking say,

762
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:47,940
guess what? You're allowed to
say whatever the fuck you want.

763
00:45:47,941 --> 00:45:50,430
And then I'm allowed to say whatever
the fuck I want against you.

764
00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:53,310
But the minute you say you're not allowed
to say what you want and if you do,

765
00:45:53,311 --> 00:45:54,660
I'll shoot you,
then you can fuck off.

766
00:45:54,930 --> 00:45:57,420
And that's what World
War II was fought over.

767
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:59,460
That's what world war one was fought over.

768
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:03,930
And if we don't say there
can be no censorship than
we should have just given up

769
00:46:03,931 --> 00:46:04,830
and said, yeah, fuck,

770
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:07,770
we'll just write whatever Hitler
wants us to write because that's what

771
00:46:07,771 --> 00:46:08,604
censorship is.

772
00:46:08,650 --> 00:46:12,100
I was just shocked at how many people
who call themselves progressives were

773
00:46:12,101 --> 00:46:16,540
taking the stance that the,
the jokes actually were inflammatory,

774
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:19,420
but they had the same fucking
jokes about everybody.

775
00:46:19,421 --> 00:46:22,670
They there were an equal
opportunity asshole.

776
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:27,040
They fucking went after everybody and
that was their job. That's their thing.

777
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:31,180
They would, that it's satire.
It's making fun of Shit.

778
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:35,500
We roast for the world, a roast for
the world, but they roasted everybody.

779
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:38,380
And so the fact is you're now,

780
00:46:38,381 --> 00:46:41,380
you're allowed to rose to everyone except
for these guys because these guys have,

781
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:44,080
we'll shoot you. Well, not,
it's not just dad, it's the,

782
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:47,890
what's freaking me out is not that just
that people are willing to shoot you

783
00:46:47,891 --> 00:46:49,990
over cartoon. That's been
freaking me out for a long time.

784
00:46:50,290 --> 00:46:54,970
But that somehow or another people that
call themselves progressive will stand

785
00:46:54,971 --> 00:46:58,360
up and say, well, you know, I looked
at what these people were doing.

786
00:46:58,361 --> 00:47:01,060
What they were doing was really offensive.
Like that's fucking crazy.

787
00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:04,750
But you know the reason why that's
happening, why is it because

788
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:11,040
what's happening now is we're
reaching a critical mass,

789
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:16,210
right? You're reaching a
point where, which by the
way, if you look at terrorism,

790
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:18,960
it's been incredibly successful
because you're reading a quote,

791
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:24,120
you're reaching a critical mass where
worst people are saying now it will be

792
00:47:24,581 --> 00:47:28,170
like this. You know, for example,
the, the fight, the, the,

793
00:47:28,210 --> 00:47:30,220
the reaction always. Well, Islam

794
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:33,480
as a religion of peace. Now that's become
a joke because everyone's like, well,

795
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:36,370
it's a fucking religion of peace. Why
does this continue happening? Right?

796
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:40,600
And so progressive's or
whatever are trying to say, hey,

797
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:45,780
well maybe because they realize that
the logical conclusion of this right is

798
00:47:46,721 --> 00:47:50,860
going to be, there's going to
be bad. It's going to be okay.

799
00:47:50,861 --> 00:47:55,861
There is going to be an effective as
this polarized is Islamic fundamentalism

800
00:47:58,120 --> 00:47:58,960
gets bigger.

801
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:04,000
And then our reaction to that fundamental
fundamentalism gets worse because,

802
00:48:04,001 --> 00:48:06,910
look, I'm, I believe I'm
oppressive, progressive guy.

803
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:09,220
I don't know what that means,

804
00:48:09,221 --> 00:48:12,880
but I'm nonpolitical on either side and
I believe I look at things critically.

805
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:14,740
But at a certain point you're like,

806
00:48:14,741 --> 00:48:19,741
well this is getting bad now and public
opinion is getting heated and the end

807
00:48:23,231 --> 00:48:25,300
result of that is going to be,

808
00:48:25,301 --> 00:48:27,730
you're going to have heated
public opinion on one side,

809
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:31,630
a bunch of guys with a bunch of guns on
the other and it's not going to end well.

810
00:48:31,810 --> 00:48:36,190
So people, it's a type of
appeasement, right? It's a
type of, well I looked at it,

811
00:48:36,191 --> 00:48:38,320
it's not so bad.
Well it is bad,

812
00:48:38,590 --> 00:48:42,720
but that is high in terms of
excitement by progressive's, um,

813
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:44,880
by really liberal people,
which uh,

814
00:48:44,930 --> 00:48:48,340
the same type of people that will
shit on Christians but use the term

815
00:48:48,341 --> 00:48:52,870
Islamophobic for any criticism
of an Nad. Jokes. In fact,

816
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:57,900
any jokes in fact about Islam or
Muslims can be seen as Islamophobic,

817
00:48:58,451 --> 00:49:01,440
but the same type of people that would
have no problem shitting your Christian

818
00:49:01,450 --> 00:49:05,470
Jews. And it's just weird thing. It's
because of this, this is what become,

819
00:49:05,471 --> 00:49:08,680
what's the park? It's appeasement.
And, and quite frankly,

820
00:49:08,681 --> 00:49:12,020
what's good for the goose is good for the
gander. Everybody should be game. And,

821
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:15,010
and that's what freedom is all about.
Who's it appeasement to?

822
00:49:15,011 --> 00:49:19,010
It's this weird social brownie point
thing that they're doing where they're,

823
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:24,040
they're maybe looking at
it as an opportunity to
criticize racism or criticize,

824
00:49:25,270 --> 00:49:29,530
punching down with humor. You
know, maybe I, I mean, I, sorry,

825
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:34,460
I'm getting a drink. So, no worries man.
I think, you know, for me, I think it's,

826
00:49:34,630 --> 00:49:35,463
it's,

827
00:49:35,470 --> 00:49:40,000
we're afraid of the outcome because
if we keep going on this trajectory,

828
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:43,240
the outcome is going to be problematic.

829
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:46,060
I think you have a point there for sure.

830
00:49:46,061 --> 00:49:49,600
But I also think one of the things that's
going on is there's a bunch of people

831
00:49:49,601 --> 00:49:54,601
in this culture that have this bizarrely
Utopian version of what they would like

832
00:49:55,361 --> 00:50:00,361
us to be like the way we
should react to anything.

833
00:50:01,361 --> 00:50:06,040
People that think that they're a Fox
something, someone that, uh, decides to,

834
00:50:06,041 --> 00:50:10,870
uh, have whatever, any strange
idea they may have in their head.

835
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:14,560
We're supposed to be as even
keeled with them as possible. Well,

836
00:50:14,561 --> 00:50:16,060
I don't want to get started on politics.

837
00:50:17,270 --> 00:50:19,850
I think politics in this country
is fucked. I think it's Moreso,

838
00:50:19,910 --> 00:50:22,150
I think it's fucked
and it's getting worse.

839
00:50:22,630 --> 00:50:27,010
And we could go on till the cows come
home about politics in this country.

840
00:50:27,590 --> 00:50:31,550
Um, one thing I would like
if we were, if you want,

841
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:36,470
I would be long winded and boring for
most people, but, um, I read a book,

842
00:50:36,471 --> 00:50:41,090
if anyone wants to read maybe the most
fascinating book ever written about the,

843
00:50:41,091 --> 00:50:42,680
uh, the, uh,

844
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:46,550
the situation that we're dealing with
right now and with the rest of the world.

845
00:50:46,551 --> 00:50:49,850
And Islam is a,
is called the siege of Maca.

846
00:50:50,510 --> 00:50:55,100
And it's a true story. It's a
journalist who wrote it about in 1979,

847
00:50:55,101 --> 00:50:57,810
which was the, the, the difference, uh,

848
00:50:58,250 --> 00:51:00,590
I believe the year 1400
in the Islamic calendar,

849
00:51:01,070 --> 00:51:03,950
there was a siege of Maca and,
uh,

850
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:09,400
a bunch of dudes who were wahabiists
took over Maca during Hajj and the Royal

851
00:51:10,490 --> 00:51:11,090
Government,
uh,

852
00:51:11,090 --> 00:51:14,720
the royal family couldn't go get them
because it's illegal to fight in Mecca.

853
00:51:15,470 --> 00:51:18,740
And so there was a standoff and there
were fighting people shooting each other

854
00:51:18,741 --> 00:51:20,420
and snipers.
It's like an action movie.

855
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:24,980
The French secret service gave them
drugs to drug them. And, and uh,

856
00:51:24,981 --> 00:51:28,850
at the time it was the same time that
that was happening. Uh, the, the,

857
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:33,560
the hostage crisis in Toronto, the
ayatollah was a smart dude goes, yeah,

858
00:51:33,561 --> 00:51:36,140
the Americans,
the CIA have taken over Mecca,

859
00:51:36,141 --> 00:51:39,530
which of course is like the worst
thing you could possibly fucking do.

860
00:51:39,770 --> 00:51:43,550
So there's this whole upper, early,
they burnt the embassy in Pakistan.

861
00:51:43,551 --> 00:51:45,380
They do all these things
because everyone's like,

862
00:51:45,381 --> 00:51:47,900
fuck the CIA have taken over Maca,
you know,

863
00:51:48,290 --> 00:51:53,290
and what ended up happening as long
story but incredible action movie story.

864
00:51:54,351 --> 00:51:59,351
But what happened was the royal family
had to go to the clerics and say,

865
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:04,040
you've got to give us a fat whether
we can go into Mecca and fight,

866
00:52:04,041 --> 00:52:06,470
because you're literally not allowed
to bring a gun in a sword. Nothing.

867
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:10,610
And so you have to give us a special
fatwa to go get these terrorists.

868
00:52:10,611 --> 00:52:15,590
And they're like, well, we kind of believe
in what they're saying because the,

869
00:52:15,610 --> 00:52:17,230
the, the terrorist, we're actually,

870
00:52:17,231 --> 00:52:19,970
you're just a hobbyist saying
we need to be more wahabiists,

871
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,300
which is fundamental Islam.
So they said,

872
00:52:23,301 --> 00:52:28,301
we'll give you the fatwah if you then
basically give us money to do what they're

873
00:52:29,181 --> 00:52:32,810
asking for it to, to be well
hobbyist. So then anyways, it happens,

874
00:52:32,811 --> 00:52:35,420
they go to kill the guys
guy named Jude Haman.

875
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:38,990
But then what happens is from then on,

876
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:42,170
billions and billions of petro dollars,

877
00:52:42,171 --> 00:52:45,140
which we pay the Saudi government
then goes to the Ulama,

878
00:52:45,170 --> 00:52:49,910
the clerics who then send
that money to every country,

879
00:52:49,911 --> 00:52:53,900
America, UK, France, you know,

880
00:52:54,050 --> 00:52:56,750
Pakistan.
And they build the biggest mosques.

881
00:52:56,780 --> 00:53:01,780
And because Maca is like the Vatican
would be in the UL mark or like the pope,

882
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:04,760
they built the biggest mosques and they,
you know,

883
00:53:04,761 --> 00:53:09,680
spend the most money and then they
say, okay, now you teach Wahhabi Islam.

884
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:13,430
And you know, when you look at
what's happening with Isis, you say,

885
00:53:13,431 --> 00:53:18,431
how the fuck can these guys
recruit 50,000 foreign fighters in,

886
00:53:18,861 --> 00:53:22,400
in four fucking months? It doesn't make
any sense. They're coming from America,

887
00:53:22,401 --> 00:53:26,490
they're coming from France or coming from
England because these guys go to these

888
00:53:27,030 --> 00:53:31,380
mosques where there were
hobbyists teachings, right?
And then when you look at it,

889
00:53:31,381 --> 00:53:35,310
and when you look at what's happening
with things happening in France with

890
00:53:35,311 --> 00:53:38,520
things happening in the UK with
things happening in Pakistan,

891
00:53:38,810 --> 00:53:41,700
w w where we're saying we're not
going to go with the Taliban,

892
00:53:41,701 --> 00:53:45,390
even in Pakistan now where we're going
with isis or the Taliban is aligning with

893
00:53:45,391 --> 00:53:49,470
Isis and you say,
how the fuck can that happen overnight?

894
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:53,160
How can it happen that all these people
are saying, fuck yeah, that's great. Isis.

895
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:57,810
It's because we have the pope and
the Vatican saying that that's good.

896
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:01,500
That will hobby ism as good.
So as long as that continues,

897
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:05,520
the problem on the, that side
is going to get worse. Right?

898
00:54:05,521 --> 00:54:07,710
And then as long as
that problem gets worse,

899
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:12,860
we're going to fucking react stronger
and stronger as is only human.

900
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:18,810
And that's the problem is, is we're
heading for some sort of boiling over,

901
00:54:18,870 --> 00:54:22,110
we're heading for some sort of,
you know, thing. And I think,

902
00:54:22,111 --> 00:54:24,600
and this is me giving people
the benefit of the doubt,

903
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:27,800
is that some people are
saying, well fuck if, if,

904
00:54:27,810 --> 00:54:31,860
if we just let into everything now and
say, you know, everyone's shooting us.

905
00:54:31,861 --> 00:54:33,840
If we say the wrong
thing, fuck you, let's go.

906
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:37,050
Then it's going to happen sooner
rather than later. Which, which,

907
00:54:37,051 --> 00:54:41,490
which might be inevitable
if Maca keeps on funding.

908
00:54:41,550 --> 00:54:44,400
Wahabiists Sunni doctrine.

909
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:49,550
Jesus fucking in Christ Shane.
Goddamn doom and gloom.

910
00:54:49,551 --> 00:54:50,440
Sorry Bitch.

911
00:54:50,610 --> 00:54:54,590
The world is melting coming from Russia.

912
00:54:54,830 --> 00:54:55,850
It's coming from,

913
00:54:56,030 --> 00:54:59,780
maybe North Korea is going to kidnap
your wife and forced her to do porn. No,

914
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:02,450
God dammit. This is all this shit. Sorry.

915
00:55:02,510 --> 00:55:05,810
Right now let's start
15 with some positivity.

916
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:10,130
God Damn you freaking me the fuck that.
Start with the positive. What about the,

917
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:12,770
wow, the thing is we can change
it all. We're human beings.

918
00:55:12,771 --> 00:55:16,190
We're smart and I believe there's enough
of us now that are woken up and are

919
00:55:16,191 --> 00:55:20,600
smart and understand our political and
economic power and we could stop all this

920
00:55:20,601 --> 00:55:22,040
shit from happening.
Cause I'll tell you what,

921
00:55:22,370 --> 00:55:26,090
North Korea only exists because
people let it exist. Right.

922
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:30,080
Global warming only continues
because we let it continue.

923
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:34,640
I mean fucking other problems that we
have with terrorism only continue because

924
00:55:34,641 --> 00:55:35,780
we let it fucking continue.

925
00:55:35,781 --> 00:55:38,600
If humanity as a whole says we ain't
going to fucking do that anymore,

926
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:39,770
it would stop tomorrow.

927
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:43,850
We would need a lot of people to band
together to go after North Korea though.

928
00:55:43,851 --> 00:55:46,750
North Korea seems like a huge problem.
And on top of that,

929
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:49,340
don't think I have like nuclear weapons.
I mean how are you going to stop?

930
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:53,300
Well stop it from inside.
You have to stop it from inside.

931
00:55:53,301 --> 00:55:56,690
But I think that that's where like
everyone running around freaking out about

932
00:55:56,691 --> 00:56:00,770
the interview. Oh my God, North Korea
fucking told us we can't do something.

933
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:05,570
We should be figuring out ways of
getting the interview into North Korea.

934
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:07,160
We should in fact fuck the interview.

935
00:56:07,161 --> 00:56:10,580
We should be figuring out how to get
at an NFL football into North Korea or,

936
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:13,620
or like fucking, you
know, lassie or Heidi,

937
00:56:13,621 --> 00:56:16,880
your dukes of hazard or any kind
of shit. Because I think, you know,

938
00:56:16,881 --> 00:56:21,500
one of the smartest things that America
learned after World War One and World

939
00:56:21,501 --> 00:56:26,200
War Two is if you, your troops
had costs a lot of fucking money,

940
00:56:26,201 --> 00:56:30,230
and it takes a lot of lives where if
you figure out that Marlboro's cokes and

941
00:56:30,231 --> 00:56:34,540
Mcdonald's and Hollywood, uh,
everybody loves them, then guess what?

942
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:37,290
You don't have to fight the war.
You want. Everybody's like, fucking,

943
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:38,021
I want to smoke.

944
00:56:38,021 --> 00:56:41,860
This is Barbara while I'm drinking a
coke and watch and Brad Pitt, you know,

945
00:56:41,861 --> 00:56:43,030
Graham ski and hedge money.

946
00:56:43,031 --> 00:56:48,031
And I think that we should be exporting
our culture a lot more aggressively in

947
00:56:48,501 --> 00:56:51,640
the North Korea. And I'll tell you what,
Kim Jong Un grew up in Switzerland.

948
00:56:51,641 --> 00:56:53,590
He loves basketball.
He was watching TV.

949
00:56:53,591 --> 00:56:56,860
He knows what fucking time and he's
in the, he's watched the, you know,

950
00:56:57,190 --> 00:57:00,440
fucking Dukes of Hazzard. He or I
guess you'd be later. He'd be, what?

951
00:57:00,441 --> 00:57:03,880
What's the big 90 show?
Check it out.

952
00:57:04,030 --> 00:57:08,620
I'm using the Detroit Pistons,
right? Isn't he a big fan of, uh,

953
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:12,220
what's his face? Rodman. Well,
he was, yeah, he was bulls.

954
00:57:12,221 --> 00:57:17,020
They liked the bulls cause it was Jordan.
Right. But what else did he play for it?

955
00:57:17,021 --> 00:57:20,070
Did he pay for the play Pistons and then
they pistol's distance and bowls? Yeah,

956
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:23,800
you're right. He's got like metal
all over his face now. Yeah.

957
00:57:24,610 --> 00:57:26,740
What's going on with that dude?
He's a weird dude.

958
00:57:26,741 --> 00:57:31,590
He's always been a weird guy that Kim
Jong Uhmm is sort of connected to.

959
00:57:31,610 --> 00:57:34,900
We sent them there. You know that?
Yeah. But how the fuck is that real?

960
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,030
Because they love fucking the bowls.
I mean,

961
00:57:37,031 --> 00:57:39,670
if Michael Jordan would have gone
there and I hope Michael Jordan,

962
00:57:39,671 --> 00:57:42,610
he listened to this.
If Michael Jordan would have gone there,

963
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:47,080
it would have been world peace. I mean
forced him to do ebony porn. You know,

964
00:57:47,081 --> 00:57:50,410
I think, I think there would have been
so much good will. He was said, look,

965
00:57:50,411 --> 00:57:53,320
let's just fucking call it a day.
Do you think so if Michael Jordan,

966
00:57:53,350 --> 00:57:54,610
he would have been and he would,

967
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:58,090
I think he would have been a god like
ambassador and he would have been a little

968
00:57:58,091 --> 00:57:59,530
bit more sane.
Really?

969
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:03,550
So you think you could have actually
gotten like diplomacy accomplished? Well,

970
00:58:03,551 --> 00:58:07,030
I think there was the diplomacy
accomplished. I think if
you look at it, you know,

971
00:58:07,031 --> 00:58:11,410
one of the things that, um,
well besides oil tanking, uh,

972
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:15,460
that that helped detente between Cuba and,
and America was baseball.

973
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:20,320
If you look at [inaudible] and all
the stars that came out of, of Cuba,

974
00:58:20,820 --> 00:58:23,950
you know, the culturally, they were
just like, okay, fuck it. Fuck this.

975
00:58:23,951 --> 00:58:25,760
Let's just do it. And
I think that, you know,

976
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:28,720
the number one sport in
North Korea is basketball.

977
00:58:29,530 --> 00:58:31,810
And so it's like if Jordan had gone there,

978
00:58:31,811 --> 00:58:35,410
or even if the bowls would've gone there
and there had been a real fucking thing

979
00:58:35,411 --> 00:58:40,030
and a cultural outreach or whatever, it
would have at least sped it up, right?

980
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:42,670
Because that was ping pong
diplomacy. They were like, wow,

981
00:58:43,030 --> 00:58:46,090
we don't actually eat each other's babies.
We play fucking Ping Pong.

982
00:58:46,091 --> 00:58:50,620
Like he like, like staying like w you
know, everybody's kind of, you know,

983
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:51,790
when I went,
I was always,

984
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:56,590
I grew up at the end of the Cold War
and I was fascinated by propaganda.

985
00:58:56,591 --> 00:59:00,010
I was fascinated by
eastern Europe and when I,

986
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:03,610
as soon as it opened up and went to
Prague and progress was inundated with

987
00:59:03,611 --> 00:59:06,910
Americans. So then I went to
Budapest and then I went to Kia.

988
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:11,260
But it was like not that much
fucking different. They had,

989
00:59:11,350 --> 00:59:12,910
they had a car and they an apartment,

990
00:59:12,911 --> 00:59:14,540
they got two weeks and
they went to lake bow tie.

991
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:16,180
It was a shitty car and it was a sheet,

992
00:59:16,181 --> 00:59:18,220
but no fucking guy from
point a to point B.

993
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:21,680
And they kind of were pissed off at their
government, but they were kind of like,

994
00:59:21,681 --> 00:59:22,040
wow,

995
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:24,290
whatever, fuck there's food
in the second story, you know?

996
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:29,240
And it was kind of shitty year.
It was a shitty or gray or w you know,

997
00:59:29,241 --> 00:59:31,370
scary or I guess cause
of the police version.

998
00:59:31,820 --> 00:59:35,480
But in reality it's like people are
fucking people at the end of the day,

999
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:39,650
except for North Korea. I mean North
Korea, it's just fucking crazy.

1000
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:44,150
But I think that the more,
it's not actually us, we're
not doing shit over there.

1001
00:59:44,151 --> 00:59:48,350
At least they think where the devil.
But Chinese people who used to come look,

1002
00:59:48,690 --> 00:59:51,720
they were wearing the man with suit and
with the stars everywhere and they look

1003
00:59:51,721 --> 00:59:55,340
the same and they talked to Sam and there
was still revolutionary are now coming

1004
00:59:55,341 --> 00:59:59,060
in Hawaiian shirts and with a cannon
fucking ass five and a fucking thing.

1005
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:00,910
It's our culture got over there.
Yeah.

1006
01:00:00,911 --> 01:00:03,410
I think global culture got
there and consumers culture,

1007
01:00:03,411 --> 01:00:05,510
I mean China is the most capitalist
country in the world now,

1008
01:00:05,810 --> 01:00:09,200
but the Chinese who are coming in North
Korea don't look like them any more.

1009
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:10,130
They don't act like that.

1010
01:00:10,131 --> 01:00:13,170
I mean they have fucking laser
beams in their hands like phones,

1011
01:00:13,340 --> 01:00:14,900
they don't have phones,
they don't have computers.

1012
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:19,190
So they see all this shit from the Chinese
and go, oh okay, something's going on.

1013
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:24,560
And I think if we, if we just exported
our culture that the fact that hey guys,

1014
01:00:24,561 --> 01:00:26,630
you're actually living in
fucking a hundred years ago,

1015
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:29,300
you should come and get
up to speed with us.

1016
01:00:29,930 --> 01:00:33,020
I mean that's what happened in East
Germany, east Germany, Western.

1017
01:00:33,021 --> 01:00:35,090
And they said this is never
going to come together. Boom.

1018
01:00:35,330 --> 01:00:38,570
They realize that these motherfuckers
over there and driving nine eleven's and

1019
01:00:38,571 --> 01:00:43,310
I'm driving a fucking louder.
So you know, that's what one,

1020
01:00:43,311 --> 01:00:47,120
that's one won the war. This
is there a way though. Did
anybody could ever, I mean,

1021
01:00:47,121 --> 01:00:50,180
you'd have to get rid of
that whole family. You'd have
to get rid of that whole,

1022
01:00:50,270 --> 01:00:53,160
I dunno. I mean government that's
running. I mean, it's just soften.

1023
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:57,340
The family does, I mean, now who the fuck
knows? I don't know shit. But you know,

1024
01:00:57,350 --> 01:01:00,600
from what I know about going there a lot,
the military runs everything.

1025
01:01:00,601 --> 01:01:02,930
It's called military first.
The army runs everything.

1026
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:06,980
Whenever the army runs
everything anywhere, guess
what? It's not a ton of fun.

1027
01:01:07,730 --> 01:01:12,680
Kim Jong Moon is, is uh, is, is he looks
like his, his, his Granddad, you know,

1028
01:01:12,681 --> 01:01:16,700
he's a dad. He, they got him out
of power. They killed number two.

1029
01:01:16,701 --> 01:01:20,060
They fucked with his wife. They did all
this shit, always got gout. They go away.

1030
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:23,030
They were just saying saying,
hey, you know who's running shit?

1031
01:01:23,031 --> 01:01:26,990
The army's running shit because if the
army isn't running shit in North Korea,

1032
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:29,660
it's over. Because the minute
the army isn't running shit,

1033
01:01:29,930 --> 01:01:31,400
they're going to all be in line saying,

1034
01:01:31,401 --> 01:01:35,690
can I please work at high die for some
money cause I'm fucking hungry. Yeah,

1035
01:01:36,610 --> 01:01:39,770
that's so true. It'll be exactly
what happened in East Germany.

1036
01:01:40,070 --> 01:01:42,140
I got a great idea for a buddy comedy.

1037
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:48,450
How about this? How about Kim
John Own captures a basketball,

1038
01:01:48,451 --> 01:01:50,910
a college basketball
team from like whatever,

1039
01:01:50,911 --> 01:01:54,850
like the World Championship
College Basketball is
whatever the Flint talky get's

1040
01:01:54,870 --> 01:01:58,580
Kentucky. Yeah, whatever the big,
the big team is, captures them.

1041
01:01:58,650 --> 01:01:59,730
Reroutes their plane.

1042
01:01:59,731 --> 01:02:04,230
It lands in North Korea and kidnaps him
and forces them to play basketball for

1043
01:02:04,231 --> 01:02:09,231
him and they wind up taking on the North
Korean army kicking everybody's ass and

1044
01:02:10,471 --> 01:02:13,170
taking over the country and they
become the president of North Korea.

1045
01:02:14,070 --> 01:02:16,200
I like it except for,
except for,

1046
01:02:16,201 --> 01:02:20,550
I'd like to change it to
the best college basketball

1047
01:02:20,550 --> 01:02:25,270
team in America gets kidnapped
by the North Korean, uh,

1048
01:02:25,290 --> 01:02:25,981
desk spot,

1049
01:02:25,981 --> 01:02:30,981
which makes them play the worst pro team
in America for a winner take all game

1050
01:02:32,550 --> 01:02:34,920
because it's always that
question at the end of the year,

1051
01:02:35,100 --> 01:02:39,390
if the best college team plays
the worst pro team who would win.

1052
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:42,840
And I love those arguments and
everyone's always like, well,

1053
01:02:42,841 --> 01:02:47,210
if Oakland played Bama Wall,
now it's a buckeyes.

1054
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:52,440
But if let's say Bama, cause
I love Bam, if, if Oakland
played Bammo, then you know,

1055
01:02:52,860 --> 01:02:55,820
they would throw so many schemes up
against them and they couldn't have,

1056
01:02:55,950 --> 01:02:58,830
but you're like, Bam, I had the
biggest offensive line in football,

1057
01:02:58,831 --> 01:03:03,630
not only not just fucking, uh,
college football, football.

1058
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:06,750
And they played together as a team and
they're fucking Austin now. They sucked,

1059
01:03:06,930 --> 01:03:09,900
you know, against Ohio. But in
any case, the best college team,

1060
01:03:10,140 --> 01:03:12,840
because then you could bet on it,
you could bet on it.

1061
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:15,660
And whoever won between American
North Korea would run the world.

1062
01:03:15,661 --> 01:03:17,430
I think we should do that.
That's what we should set up.

1063
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:19,500
What if they want North Korea?
We're on block,

1064
01:03:19,910 --> 01:03:23,090
then we'll have to kick their ass again.
We wanted the world for a second.

1065
01:03:23,091 --> 01:03:23,924
We're fucked.

1066
01:03:24,150 --> 01:03:26,520
We're not going to let you won the
world forever for a basketball game.

1067
01:03:26,521 --> 01:03:30,930
What do you retarded then we've failed
in our mission, but the pros should,

1068
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:36,080
should win the Dream Team.
Dream Team sharing happens in sports.

1069
01:03:36,090 --> 01:03:39,420
You remember the Dream Team?
People get tweaked and Spain. Yes.

1070
01:03:39,980 --> 01:03:44,790
Michael Jordan wasn't there
like a hockey game to where?

1071
01:03:44,940 --> 01:03:47,760
Well that was the opposite Americans.
That was the opposite.

1072
01:03:47,761 --> 01:03:51,570
That was the Russians were effectively
pros because they were the restaurant and

1073
01:03:51,571 --> 01:03:55,860
they would go and then we were still
putting up college players and even though

1074
01:03:56,370 --> 01:03:59,940
the Russians were pros and
we're going to kill us, we won.

1075
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:03,200
So we became the underdog. We
were, we were. We champion. Yeah.

1076
01:04:03,290 --> 01:04:05,250
We also take day for the hockey people.

1077
01:04:05,251 --> 01:04:08,370
It is a huge day to beat those
ruskies have to beat the rush.

1078
01:04:08,550 --> 01:04:09,840
The Cold War was played.

1079
01:04:10,050 --> 01:04:14,100
We Ha we need to cut kind of cold
war again just to have sports. Well,

1080
01:04:14,101 --> 01:04:17,460
you know what? Fighting Sports, fighting.
We've learned a lot from Russians.

1081
01:04:17,461 --> 01:04:20,400
I'll tell you that.
We've learned a lot how God damn tough.

1082
01:04:20,401 --> 01:04:21,590
They are tough motherfucker.

1083
01:04:21,630 --> 01:04:25,020
When we compare the softness
of the average American male,

1084
01:04:25,230 --> 01:04:28,560
so that shit I see on TV,
the Russians do the crazy,

1085
01:04:28,590 --> 01:04:32,820
the military guys over in
Russia or are mean as fuck.

1086
01:04:32,910 --> 01:04:35,550
Oh yeah, for sure. It's
not just a military guys,

1087
01:04:35,551 --> 01:04:40,530
but I mean just the average humans in
Russia. But we'll just send drones,

1088
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:45,300
we'll send laser computer people
over there while we won't win,

1089
01:04:45,450 --> 01:04:49,060
we won't win if we fight the, well you've
seen the shit. They fucking have to,

1090
01:04:49,780 --> 01:04:50,130
you know,

1091
01:04:50,130 --> 01:04:54,900
squatting or haunches for three days
and what can kicked in the face.

1092
01:04:54,901 --> 01:04:56,850
I mean they're in a
different level of shit now.

1093
01:04:56,851 --> 01:04:59,730
Not to take anything away from
the best military in the world,

1094
01:04:59,731 --> 01:05:04,230
which is the American military. But the
Russians are fucking tough motherfucker.

1095
01:05:04,231 --> 01:05:07,500
You hit him in the face with a baseball
bat and they smile. So it seems like,

1096
01:05:08,030 --> 01:05:12,390
like whenever you hear about a crazy
concept like an MMA concept comes out of

1097
01:05:12,391 --> 01:05:13,020
Russia,

1098
01:05:13,020 --> 01:05:16,890
like that team fighting where they had
like five on five or six on six or some

1099
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:17,890
shit and then

1100
01:05:18,550 --> 01:05:21,310
there was another one that I saw there.
There was two on two and once I,

1101
01:05:21,340 --> 01:05:26,340
one I saw was these guys met in like a
park somewhere and these rival teams and

1102
01:05:27,521 --> 01:05:30,820
they beat the shit out of each other and
a park. They just both met for a gang.

1103
01:05:30,980 --> 01:05:33,950
Basically. They just want to fight
the fuck out of it all the time.

1104
01:05:34,910 --> 01:05:38,360
If you see the Russian,
especially like the the, the,

1105
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:41,810
the special service training shit
that they have to go through,

1106
01:05:42,170 --> 01:05:43,970
it's fucking ridiculous.

1107
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:47,360
Obviously it's hard to become a seal
or a ranger or whatever, but like,

1108
01:05:47,660 --> 01:05:51,620
like I don't know, something like
50% of them die like some crazy stat.

1109
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:55,640
They're fucking crazy. Anyway,
we don't want to fight them.

1110
01:05:55,641 --> 01:05:59,290
I guess why everyone who's fought them
from the Boli and they hit their devry

1111
01:05:59,470 --> 01:06:04,010
last set, the mangoes, mangoes,
tomorrow's memorial was beating everybody.

1112
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:06,050
Mongols took over,
rushed for 200 years.

1113
01:06:06,051 --> 01:06:08,600
The only reason why they didn't
get the Europe is cause they got it

1114
01:06:08,630 --> 01:06:11,110
tired if they were all drunk,
drunk

1115
01:06:13,170 --> 01:06:17,860
or horses aren't big enough. My question
was, I wonder if like, because the,

1116
01:06:18,020 --> 01:06:23,020
because Russia has suffered the defeat
and the Cold War and economic disparity

1117
01:06:23,331 --> 01:06:24,680
and it was called hard times.

1118
01:06:24,681 --> 01:06:29,060
They've gone through some brutal
infighting and all the shit that happened,

1119
01:06:29,090 --> 01:06:33,110
the people that did survive
there, there, there are different,

1120
01:06:33,530 --> 01:06:36,320
there's like a different lineage where
they're tough as hell. Yeah. Yeah.

1121
01:06:36,321 --> 01:06:41,030
And I wonder if that's just what happens
and then those people rise up and then

1122
01:06:41,031 --> 01:06:44,000
the people like us that
are on top of things,

1123
01:06:44,090 --> 01:06:47,540
we start criticizing cartoons
and they get soft and fat.

1124
01:06:47,541 --> 01:06:50,300
And when they made the cartoon shouldn't
be punching down. Yeah. Let me get,

1125
01:06:50,301 --> 01:06:52,030
we get goofy. That's true. Yeah.

1126
01:06:52,070 --> 01:06:56,540
And then we get so unrealistic as to the
nature of man and the ways of the world

1127
01:06:56,541 --> 01:06:58,160
and the way things work right now.

1128
01:06:58,310 --> 01:07:01,280
Not a utopian vision of what
could certainly be possible.

1129
01:07:01,490 --> 01:07:03,720
But the fact like I saw a t shirt,
uh,

1130
01:07:03,740 --> 01:07:08,010
you don't like cops next time you get
in trouble, call crackhead. Well listen,

1131
01:07:08,090 --> 01:07:10,790
people that are complaining
and bitching about cops,

1132
01:07:10,791 --> 01:07:13,820
I guarantee you if someone was
breaking into your fucking house,

1133
01:07:14,090 --> 01:07:15,890
you're going to call nine one one right?

1134
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:17,370
Whenever you're right.

1135
01:07:17,371 --> 01:07:21,930
But whenever I go to any of these places
and you see dude's like sleeping in the

1136
01:07:21,931 --> 01:07:24,600
sand, eating dirt, you know,

1137
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:29,280
cuddling their coalition to cough for
warmth. And then you look at, look,

1138
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:32,670
I'll be the first to put my hand up.
You're looking at me and I'm like, well,

1139
01:07:33,330 --> 01:07:36,680
well I have in and out
burger or a Wendy's, I will,

1140
01:07:36,681 --> 01:07:41,460
I have the supersized coke or the value
of them, you know, and I'm just like,

1141
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:45,360
you know, I used to, when I was young,
I used to think that was a tough guy.

1142
01:07:45,361 --> 01:07:49,710
And when you see these dudes who literally
know nothing but an AK 47 and we'll

1143
01:07:49,711 --> 01:07:54,480
eat sand, you're like, yeah, I don't
want to fight that guy. And by the way,

1144
01:07:54,540 --> 01:07:58,650
the majority of people I
know in our country, why?
Because our country is great.

1145
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:03,450
You don't want to fight
these motherfuckers cause
they w they are fucking bad

1146
01:08:03,451 --> 01:08:04,620
ass and it's like,
you know,

1147
01:08:04,710 --> 01:08:08,790
I think we've had this discussion before
but you know when you look at boxing

1148
01:08:08,791 --> 01:08:11,580
and shit, the tougher the neighborhood,
the poor, the neighborhood,

1149
01:08:11,581 --> 01:08:13,620
the better the boxer.
Cause they're fighting for something,

1150
01:08:13,650 --> 01:08:16,160
they want to get the fuck out.
You don't see a lot

1151
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:20,100
of Harvard boxers. They're going one,
two, three current, you know dad.

1152
01:08:20,101 --> 01:08:23,470
And it's also, they're used to dealing
with violence on a regular basis.

1153
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:27,710
They can operate more effectively
in those high pressure scenarios.

1154
01:08:28,010 --> 01:08:30,550
I think that's what we're
saying about Russians to these,

1155
01:08:30,570 --> 01:08:32,240
these are harder people.
They're,

1156
01:08:32,241 --> 01:08:36,560
they're stronger in will and in character
because of what they've had to go

1157
01:08:36,561 --> 01:08:39,680
through.
I think if you look at the last,

1158
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:43,700
the two longest wars in American history,
if you look at Iraq and Afghanistan,

1159
01:08:44,630 --> 01:08:48,620
and then I remember when
Russia invaded Crimea,

1160
01:08:48,621 --> 01:08:51,550
which is 90% Russian,
you know,

1161
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:54,980
Fox News was saying it was the first
time they've ever gone without a shot and

1162
01:08:54,981 --> 01:08:56,660
we should go in and where are we
going to do? And then you're like,

1163
01:08:56,690 --> 01:09:00,620
hold on a second, hold on a second.
You're talking about going into Russia,

1164
01:09:00,650 --> 01:09:05,650
which is Russian to fight Russians
about taking over a part of Russia.

1165
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:11,000
You know, the tr traditionally
was a part of Russia. You know,

1166
01:09:11,180 --> 01:09:16,180
we had a hard time in Iraq with not
the greatest in the world with a lot of

1167
01:09:16,521 --> 01:09:19,400
terrorists. We had a hard time in, in,

1168
01:09:19,490 --> 01:09:23,870
in Afghanistan with the Taliban
who aren't even in an army.

1169
01:09:23,890 --> 01:09:25,780
And in any real sense of the word,

1170
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:29,150
you're going to go take on the
Russians and Russia's backyard.

1171
01:09:29,180 --> 01:09:33,800
You're going to get a fucking bloody nose
like you have never experienced before.

1172
01:09:34,100 --> 01:09:38,250
If you're going to do it, you better be
ready to go all in. And that's, you know,

1173
01:09:38,390 --> 01:09:42,470
one of the things that NATO has a thing
that if you attack any NATO country,

1174
01:09:42,860 --> 01:09:47,120
all of NATO then has to go and go with
you obviously were a part of NATO.

1175
01:09:47,121 --> 01:09:51,620
So that means if anyone fucks with an
island of Finland or someone fucks with

1176
01:09:51,710 --> 01:09:53,720
fucking Norway's fishing rights,
whatever,

1177
01:09:54,020 --> 01:09:56,480
we all got to go in and then you're like,
well,

1178
01:09:56,481 --> 01:10:00,080
we better be ready for that and we better
understand what the fuck that means.

1179
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:00,801
Cause guess what,

1180
01:10:00,801 --> 01:10:05,801
the Russians have been doing fucking
power squats with an AK 47 ready to go.

1181
01:10:06,851 --> 01:10:11,820
Uh, we've been sorta eating pop rocks
and drinking coke and fan. I know,

1182
01:10:11,830 --> 01:10:14,890
I think, I think playstation
is better than Nintendo.

1183
01:10:15,470 --> 01:10:19,130
What's the real with the real difference
between us though is economic, right?

1184
01:10:19,131 --> 01:10:23,660
Like for the law and we rush and they
don't know fuck and economy like we do.

1185
01:10:23,661 --> 01:10:24,920
Right. I mean, look,

1186
01:10:24,921 --> 01:10:28,460
the thing is no difference as far as
like what they can put into the military,

1187
01:10:28,461 --> 01:10:31,190
into their budget and the
resources. Well, you know,

1188
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:34,280
Russia and China have always had
a different philosophy, which is,

1189
01:10:34,281 --> 01:10:38,510
may have a lot more of it, you know, so
they have more tanks that are Shittier,

1190
01:10:38,630 --> 01:10:41,180
but they're out of fucking, you
gotta shoot 10 of them, you know,

1191
01:10:41,181 --> 01:10:44,790
Dubai and China used to, that
was their thing. Waves, you know,

1192
01:10:44,870 --> 01:10:46,860
they'd have waves of people
and they would literally, your,

1193
01:10:46,870 --> 01:10:50,360
your machine gun would over heat
kind of thing. So if you look at it,

1194
01:10:50,361 --> 01:10:52,340
we have the best military in the world,

1195
01:10:52,341 --> 01:10:54,740
most technologically advanced
military in the world.

1196
01:10:55,340 --> 01:10:58,310
But I dunno what the standing army
is and I'm going to get in shit,

1197
01:10:58,311 --> 01:11:01,850
no matter what number I say, but let's
say it's 3 million, right. You know,

1198
01:11:01,851 --> 01:11:02,930
then you look at Russia,

1199
01:11:02,931 --> 01:11:07,890
it's probably 30 and if you
look at China's probably
300 million. Yeah. I mean,

1200
01:11:07,891 --> 01:11:12,350
because every, well, I, I believe in
China, look it up. I think at one,

1201
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:14,940
at one point in China,
everybody has to be in the military.

1202
01:11:14,941 --> 01:11:19,830
They have 1,000,000,003 people. So, you
know, but yeah, but that's the thing is,

1203
01:11:19,831 --> 01:11:23,790
is you can have however many people you
want the most technologically advanced

1204
01:11:23,791 --> 01:11:27,870
military in the world, but if you're
fucking with China, you're in trouble.

1205
01:11:28,020 --> 01:11:31,320
And if you're fucking with Russia,
you're in trouble. Then it goes to, well,

1206
01:11:31,321 --> 01:11:32,670
we have a lot more nukes on them.

1207
01:11:32,671 --> 01:11:35,310
And then obviously that's not
a question you went to. Yeah.

1208
01:11:35,311 --> 01:11:39,360
That's the worst question you can ever
get into the United States armed forces

1209
01:11:39,361 --> 01:11:43,800
standing army. Let's see how many
people we've got. Active personnel,

1210
01:11:43,801 --> 01:11:47,400
1,369,000 combat troops was,

1211
01:11:47,401 --> 01:11:52,230
that's in total as active personnel.
It's just the Wiki. Yeah. Cause comp,

1212
01:11:52,260 --> 01:11:53,910
if you look at combat personnel,

1213
01:11:53,911 --> 01:11:57,780
it's usually 20% which is
a staggeringly low number.

1214
01:11:57,781 --> 01:12:02,610
It's like 300,000 people's.
Whoa. That's terrifying. Yeah.

1215
01:12:02,611 --> 01:12:04,800
This, uh, that's not good.

1216
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:08,580
This idea that we're going to go
to war with someone like Russia to,

1217
01:12:08,581 --> 01:12:13,010
that freaks people out too, because we
can't go to worldwide look white gangs.

1218
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:18,240
You Go, no, you don't. You can't go to
war with Russia because a, you know,

1219
01:12:18,850 --> 01:12:21,690
whoever, maybe maybe it
would be a tie, let's say.

1220
01:12:22,020 --> 01:12:24,150
But then all those nukes,

1221
01:12:24,990 --> 01:12:28,980
all you need is one crazy
general on either side. One
crazy motherfucker to say,

1222
01:12:28,981 --> 01:12:29,700
you know what,

1223
01:12:29,700 --> 01:12:33,900
I'm going to doctor strange love this
shit and I'm just going to let fly. Yeah,

1224
01:12:34,010 --> 01:12:37,230
I'm talking to traipse.
Love this shit. But do you,

1225
01:12:37,930 --> 01:12:39,570
do you think that there
is an issue though,

1226
01:12:39,571 --> 01:12:43,350
the difference between going to war with
someone who doesn't look like what we

1227
01:12:43,351 --> 01:12:47,220
perceive to be the quintessential or
you know what? I'm typical. I mean,

1228
01:12:47,221 --> 01:12:48,270
you know what?
Yes.

1229
01:12:48,271 --> 01:12:53,220
But you know what I'm confused
about is if you look at America,

1230
01:12:53,250 --> 01:12:58,020
what would you say the number one
security political problem in America is

1231
01:12:58,021 --> 01:13:01,110
today?
Security.

1232
01:13:01,980 --> 01:13:06,450
Security issue. Security problem.
Political. Not Political problem.

1233
01:13:06,451 --> 01:13:10,500
Like you can't be debt or energy or
whatever. Like a political seat though.

1234
01:13:10,501 --> 01:13:14,880
Like you're secure. Yeah. Okay. We can't
be PR and external. External, external,

1235
01:13:14,940 --> 01:13:18,750
external. We were worried about terrorism.
Okay, good. Thank you. That was,

1236
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:22,790
what's the number one by by far,

1237
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:27,420
way worse than America in Russia today.
Terrorism.

1238
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:30,090
They have terrorist attacks.
You know,

1239
01:13:30,091 --> 01:13:33,420
they had the theater where they were
all killed in the theater. They had,

1240
01:13:33,450 --> 01:13:34,830
they just had the subway state,

1241
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:39,420
they blew up two subway stations in
Moscow recently. They had the, the, the,

1242
01:13:39,421 --> 01:13:41,670
the school where they killed all the kids,
right?

1243
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:44,760
The AG stands coming up and the Russia,
they have these late,

1244
01:13:44,820 --> 01:13:49,020
they have nine eleven's right.
On a yearly basis. Right.

1245
01:13:49,230 --> 01:13:51,240
Since then you look at China and say,

1246
01:13:51,241 --> 01:13:54,810
what's the biggest external threat
happening in China right now?

1247
01:13:56,010 --> 01:13:59,850
Right. Terrorism. So western
China, the youngers are,

1248
01:13:59,851 --> 01:14:04,851
the wiggers are fucking going ape shit
in northern China and Outer Mongolia.

1249
01:14:05,490 --> 01:14:07,740
And it's causing a huge,
massive,

1250
01:14:07,741 --> 01:14:12,190
massive problem within China
where hundreds and thousands
of people being killed

1251
01:14:12,191 --> 01:14:15,490
and slaughters and bus stops and
train stops. So just had one recently.

1252
01:14:15,850 --> 01:14:20,500
And what's interesting is you say, okay,
the three major powers in the world,

1253
01:14:20,501 --> 01:14:23,020
America, China, and Russia, right,

1254
01:14:23,290 --> 01:14:27,010
all share the exact same number one enemy,

1255
01:14:27,550 --> 01:14:31,990
which is terrorism within their countries,
aligned terrorism.

1256
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:36,370
It's the same group, same
groups. And then you say, okay,

1257
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:41,770
uh, why the fuck wouldn't we just
get together and say, hey guys,

1258
01:14:42,100 --> 01:14:45,910
we have exactly the same m and India
by the way, is in there as well.

1259
01:14:46,330 --> 01:14:48,190
Why the fuck don't we get
together and say, hey,

1260
01:14:48,191 --> 01:14:50,380
this is a huge problem for all of us.

1261
01:14:50,410 --> 01:14:54,280
Massive fucking problem
for all of us and Europe.

1262
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:58,420
Put everybody in there and say, why the
fuck don't we get together and say, Hey,

1263
01:14:58,450 --> 01:15:03,450
we've got to solve this one way
or tother because it's much the,

1264
01:15:03,590 --> 01:15:07,480
the deaths by terrorism. I believe
our number one, China, number two,

1265
01:15:07,481 --> 01:15:08,650
Russian number three America.

1266
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:11,680
The why the fuck don't we get to go on
and say let's do something about this

1267
01:15:11,681 --> 01:15:12,514
collectively.

1268
01:15:13,250 --> 01:15:14,480
Number three America.

1269
01:15:14,481 --> 01:15:18,050
But there must be number three all have
in countries that we've invaded to bring

1270
01:15:18,051 --> 01:15:20,920
us into number three, right?
Cause of death by terrorism.

1271
01:15:20,940 --> 01:15:24,590
I liked the 3000 people that died in
nine 11 and what other attacks? You know,

1272
01:15:24,591 --> 01:15:25,220
a few other,

1273
01:15:25,220 --> 01:15:29,960
yeah, it would be, it would be a
tax on Americans and foreign soil,

1274
01:15:30,380 --> 01:15:33,560
but in China to continue a war,
you have western China,

1275
01:15:33,561 --> 01:15:36,410
north western China with users in Russia.

1276
01:15:36,411 --> 01:15:40,850
It's continuing of Dagestan you have and
you have all this stuff. And then here,

1277
01:15:40,851 --> 01:15:43,370
you know, we have all of our, you know,

1278
01:15:43,700 --> 01:15:48,440
I guess it must include
a Afghanistan or Iraq

1279
01:15:48,670 --> 01:15:49,040
and a,

1280
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:54,040
Russia's getting that weird spot right
now where their economy is sinking and it

1281
01:15:54,350 --> 01:15:58,330
was like a free fall. They
lost 50% of the ruble. Yeah.

1282
01:15:58,390 --> 01:15:59,590
In the past two years.

1283
01:15:59,860 --> 01:16:00,580
Yeah. It's, it's,

1284
01:16:00,580 --> 01:16:05,580
it's a combination of sanctions
and the collapse of oil,

1285
01:16:06,671 --> 01:16:10,960
which is the majority of their GDP,
both of which are blaming on us.

1286
01:16:12,010 --> 01:16:15,610
Well, how do we fuck with their oil?
We lowered the price of it. Right?

1287
01:16:15,611 --> 01:16:16,830
Isn't that part of what's going?

1288
01:16:17,050 --> 01:16:21,850
Everyone lowered the price was shale
oil and fracking. We have, you know,

1289
01:16:21,890 --> 01:16:26,410
have done a lot to become
energy independent, which I
think is a good thing. Um,

1290
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:30,850
but the glut of shale cheap,
a fracking shale oil has,

1291
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:35,300
has driven the price down
and OPEC hasn't, uh, uh,

1292
01:16:35,350 --> 01:16:39,910
decreased supply,
which would theoretically increase it.

1293
01:16:39,911 --> 01:16:42,720
Also problems like,
uh,

1294
01:16:42,790 --> 01:16:47,790
Venezuela and Iran have sort of
solve themselves in the sense of oil

1295
01:16:48,521 --> 01:16:50,080
distribution.
Wow.

1296
01:16:51,690 --> 01:16:52,111
The,

1297
01:16:52,111 --> 01:16:56,700
when the number of barrels that
the United States produces today,

1298
01:16:56,730 --> 01:16:59,520
it's supposed to be as much or
more than anybody in the world.

1299
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:00,610
Like we produced this

1300
01:17:00,610 --> 01:17:01,960
yeah. Oils, anybody. Yeah.

1301
01:17:01,961 --> 01:17:06,961
We always produced a ton and we just
consumed more than we produce because we

1302
01:17:07,091 --> 01:17:11,810
like to consume shit. Um,
you know, but by and large,

1303
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:15,920
the biggest security problem I believe
that we had, including terrorism,

1304
01:17:15,921 --> 01:17:20,630
was that our energy dependence upon.
So if you look at Saudi Arabia,

1305
01:17:21,020 --> 01:17:21,501
you say,
okay,

1306
01:17:21,501 --> 01:17:26,330
these guys are actively
supporting mosques that say,

1307
01:17:26,390 --> 01:17:29,510
Wahhabi Islam is good. I e.
That you should not, you know,

1308
01:17:29,511 --> 01:17:34,511
you should adopt a fighting a terrorist.

1309
01:17:34,910 --> 01:17:39,860
Islam. Um, that was our money, you
know? And so at that point, you know,

1310
01:17:39,861 --> 01:17:43,430
we're giving money to Pakistan,
we're giving money to a Saudi,

1311
01:17:43,431 --> 01:17:48,050
we're giving money to a, we're giving
money to Iraq. Why? It's crazy.

1312
01:17:48,051 --> 01:17:50,780
It doesn't seem sane.
But why oil?

1313
01:17:50,820 --> 01:17:55,180
Because we need to fucking oil and and
we need all the oil and you shouldn't

1314
01:17:55,181 --> 01:17:57,620
need less oil.
Yeah,

1315
01:17:57,621 --> 01:18:00,620
well I think it puts us
in a better position.

1316
01:18:00,830 --> 01:18:04,170
It doesn't make them Desperado isn't
it better to keep them our hose?

1317
01:18:05,380 --> 01:18:09,320
Thank God I was running the country.
I would, I would continue to,

1318
01:18:09,330 --> 01:18:13,970
you know that got him on the hotel that
that question is being answered right

1319
01:18:13,971 --> 01:18:16,790
now. That question is being
answered in real time.

1320
01:18:16,820 --> 01:18:19,490
You don't want to go head to
head with a hoe, but the thing,

1321
01:18:19,491 --> 01:18:23,210
it was a check but because of the,
because of exactly what you're saying,

1322
01:18:23,211 --> 01:18:26,000
because of the stratification
of that power system.

1323
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:29,270
That's why you have isis that way.
That's why you have all this shit.

1324
01:18:29,450 --> 01:18:33,060
Everyone just thinks isis is a bunch of
dudes who went out fucking hadn't joined

1325
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:36,710
and said, you know what? Why don't we
fucking take out Chi this thunder? No,

1326
01:18:37,010 --> 01:18:41,510
what happened is you have a huge
fucking group from all over the world,

1327
01:18:41,810 --> 01:18:45,320
international fucking consensus coming
in there and saying we're going to make a

1328
01:18:45,321 --> 01:18:47,870
caliphate. And by the way, that caliphate,

1329
01:18:47,871 --> 01:18:51,430
because there were a hobbyist say we want
to take over Mecca once they take over

1330
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:54,050
Mecca, if they take over
Mecca, hopefully they don't.

1331
01:18:54,410 --> 01:18:59,330
Then you have a real problem because
then you have isis saying we are the pope

1332
01:18:59,331 --> 01:19:02,750
and fucking Rome. Thank you very
much. Is that what they want to do?

1333
01:19:02,751 --> 01:19:04,090
Is that the only of,
Oh fuck yeah.

1334
01:19:04,460 --> 01:19:08,570
That's why Saudi Arabia has shitting
their pants now is because they were

1335
01:19:08,571 --> 01:19:12,730
funding all these wahabiists things and
then an isis goes yet we're wahabiists

1336
01:19:12,860 --> 01:19:15,560
but where the real wahabiists and
we're coming to take Mecca. Why?

1337
01:19:15,561 --> 01:19:18,680
Because if you run Maca, you
run the Sunni world. Right.

1338
01:19:19,430 --> 01:19:20,820
And so there,

1339
01:19:22,070 --> 01:19:26,180
Saudi Arabia has a lot more to worry
about isis than America does because Saudi

1340
01:19:26,180 --> 01:19:29,060
Arabia, because there are real close to
fucking mech and they want to take it,

1341
01:19:29,090 --> 01:19:33,920
we need to just get giant cargo planes
like those cargo planes were do skydive

1342
01:19:33,921 --> 01:19:38,720
out of and it filled them to the top
with mushrooms and not at the end of it.

1343
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:42,200
You have like a big board where we just
push the mushrooms out the back of the

1344
01:19:42,201 --> 01:19:42,620
plane.

1345
01:19:42,620 --> 01:19:47,390
What I love is circle what I love is
we'll go on the ground with our whole

1346
01:19:47,391 --> 01:19:51,890
military and fight to them. He was saying,
oh, but we were not going to go after.

1347
01:19:51,950 --> 01:19:54,440
We'll, we'll bomb isis here
and there. And you're like,

1348
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:59,240
this is as bad as it gets to why
he's using this as bad as it gets.

1349
01:19:59,241 --> 01:20:04,220
Isis is Nazi Germany on fucking
steroids, but we're using um, drones,

1350
01:20:04,221 --> 01:20:05,330
right?
That's the idea.

1351
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:09,240
They are airstrikes or I should
really distinguish that there's,

1352
01:20:09,320 --> 01:20:12,100
I am not involved in the drone strikes,
airstrikes,

1353
01:20:12,210 --> 01:20:13,950
airstrikes and Mandera strikes.

1354
01:20:15,690 --> 01:20:18,660
And how many Isis soldiers are there?
According to Ben Affleck,

1355
01:20:18,900 --> 01:20:23,670
there's like 200 dudes. Is he
correct. What had been Afflecks say?

1356
01:20:23,750 --> 01:20:25,650
I don't know who is on
the bill Maher show.

1357
01:20:25,650 --> 01:20:29,290
He had some goofy quote that got
chewed apart by Sam. I mean I've, I,

1358
01:20:29,340 --> 01:20:33,220
so we embedded with isis for four weeks
last summer and I interviewed and I

1359
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:37,080
hit the brakes. Why'd you
say that? So casually,

1360
01:20:37,470 --> 01:20:39,900
we embedded with isis for four weeks.

1361
01:20:39,990 --> 01:20:44,040
What the fuck were you
thinking? Dude, first of all,

1362
01:20:44,041 --> 01:20:47,370
I did not say casually.
That was, and just assume,

1363
01:20:47,580 --> 01:20:51,690
I just assume everyone know it was
in the world and I didn't know we had

1364
01:20:51,691 --> 01:20:55,170
something like 45,000,040.
Fuck no, fuck no.

1365
01:20:55,530 --> 01:21:00,360
But we have a filmmaker who,
who we worked with in Palestine,

1366
01:21:01,100 --> 01:21:05,460
um, we asked if we could go
see what was happening in, uh,

1367
01:21:05,580 --> 01:21:09,680
at the time isis now I,
so, and we embedded, uh,

1368
01:21:09,720 --> 01:21:13,050
for four weeks they changed names.
The artist formerly known as Isis,

1369
01:21:13,590 --> 01:21:18,570
it's ice hole now. I, so I like the
P diddy on steroids or puff daddy.

1370
01:21:19,270 --> 01:21:19,800
So we,

1371
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:24,660
we embedded for four weeks with
them all over in Iraq and in Syria.

1372
01:21:25,350 --> 01:21:30,330
And we released a, a documentary
one, a ton of awards. It was viewed,

1373
01:21:30,331 --> 01:21:34,230
uh, you know, tens of millions
of times, you know, and um,

1374
01:21:34,590 --> 01:21:38,640
basically we didn't have any commentary.
We just pressed record.

1375
01:21:39,180 --> 01:21:40,013
And uh,

1376
01:21:40,030 --> 01:21:45,030
I really enjoyed it because
of that because it wasn't
like look at these fucking

1377
01:21:45,931 --> 01:21:49,320
cocksuckers, whatever. It was
like, Hey, your vales not,

1378
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:54,360
cause what they did is they showed us
what life under the Islamic state is and

1379
01:21:54,780 --> 01:21:56,550
it's like,
it's like Nazi Germany.

1380
01:21:56,580 --> 01:22:00,150
It's like you have to have the veil and
you can't be too happy and you can't

1381
01:22:00,151 --> 01:22:03,960
fucking eat too much licorice and
all this shit and uh, you know,

1382
01:22:03,961 --> 01:22:06,630
want a ton of awards for it.
We embedded with Isis.

1383
01:22:06,631 --> 01:22:09,540
I personally interviewed
a couple of guys from,

1384
01:22:09,541 --> 01:22:12,240
my sister was a Canadian guy who
was thought to be dead. He was not.

1385
01:22:12,241 --> 01:22:15,960
And I interviewed him.
And what's interesting is,

1386
01:22:16,020 --> 01:22:20,200
I mean the numbers vary. Um, but the,

1387
01:22:20,290 --> 01:22:21,330
the top end,

1388
01:22:21,390 --> 01:22:25,380
but the number the guy was giving
me is they 50,000 foreign fighters.

1389
01:22:25,381 --> 01:22:29,190
Now we know that they have
50,000 fighters. The argument is,

1390
01:22:29,490 --> 01:22:32,860
is it like 20 or 30,000
foreign and you know,

1391
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:36,820
20,000 Iraqi Syrian or what the,
what the mix up is.

1392
01:22:37,430 --> 01:22:40,290
But these are on the ground fighters.

1393
01:22:40,291 --> 01:22:43,430
These are not like support
troops or you know,

1394
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:47,130
logistics or mentality.
These are the fucking fighters.

1395
01:22:47,790 --> 01:22:51,600
So this is why people should sit up
and take notice is you have, I mean,

1396
01:22:51,780 --> 01:22:56,220
for us to mobilize 50,000 fighters
is a huge fucking deal, right?

1397
01:22:56,370 --> 01:22:58,740
But they have people coming from America.

1398
01:22:58,910 --> 01:23:02,820
We talked to French people in Isis.

1399
01:23:02,821 --> 01:23:07,180
We talked to Americans, we talked
to, I talked to Canadians personally,

1400
01:23:07,570 --> 01:23:12,010
you know, and we're like,
I don't understand. You're
from America or from Canada.

1401
01:23:12,011 --> 01:23:16,810
You're from France or from Germany
or from the UK. You're fighting,

1402
01:23:18,100 --> 01:23:19,270
in my mind anyway,

1403
01:23:19,271 --> 01:23:23,230
for maybe the worst political
organization around,

1404
01:23:23,830 --> 01:23:28,200
but in their mind, because they've
grown up with these well hobbyist, uh,

1405
01:23:28,460 --> 01:23:29,260
uh,

1406
01:23:29,260 --> 01:23:34,260
mosques that that's the right thing to
do because they need to be well hobbyist

1407
01:23:34,871 --> 01:23:36,880
in Mecca for it to be true Islam.

1408
01:23:37,660 --> 01:23:42,660
And that's why I think people should take
the next look at Isis because isis is

1409
01:23:43,631 --> 01:23:48,120
not going away anytime soon because these
people id logically believe that they

1410
01:23:48,121 --> 01:23:50,500
are right.
And the question shouldn't be,

1411
01:23:50,710 --> 01:23:53,800
what the fuck's happening with Isis is
the question should be how the fuck could

1412
01:23:53,801 --> 01:23:56,680
isis recruit 50,000 people
in fucking six months?

1413
01:23:57,040 --> 01:23:59,480
Well,
if you think about what the,

1414
01:23:59,580 --> 01:24:03,760
the image of the United States is and how
we've invaded these foreign countries,

1415
01:24:03,780 --> 01:24:04,930
Islamic countries,

1416
01:24:04,931 --> 01:24:09,520
and the hatred that a lot of the
Islamic radical fundamentalist guys have

1417
01:24:09,521 --> 01:24:10,630
towards the United States government.

1418
01:24:11,260 --> 01:24:14,530
If we had a similar
enemy to United States,

1419
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:19,030
as overpowering as we are,
is, is invasive as we are.

1420
01:24:19,060 --> 01:24:23,720
We have basis in over a hundred countries.
Red Dawn, could you imagine bread,

1421
01:24:23,820 --> 01:24:26,680
wake up those fucking dudes
that live in Michigan,

1422
01:24:27,190 --> 01:24:29,320
white dudes that let all their guns,

1423
01:24:29,350 --> 01:24:33,610
South Dakota and North Dakota
and fucking New Mexico,

1424
01:24:33,611 --> 01:24:38,580
Jesus Louise's, you know what kind of a
fucking army if we were invaded. Yeah,

1425
01:24:38,950 --> 01:24:42,160
that would be, it would never end
if you United States turned hard.

1426
01:24:42,300 --> 01:24:46,450
Never fucking gave us are super serum
or super soldier serums from Captain

1427
01:24:46,451 --> 01:24:50,260
America movie. Yeah,
it would be a country.

1428
01:24:50,620 --> 01:24:53,380
We're just so fat and so
far ahead of the curve,

1429
01:24:53,410 --> 01:24:55,450
but we would get down with
it pretty quick. I mean,

1430
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:59,390
well that's what we saw after nine
11 when I already had, but I think,

1431
01:24:59,420 --> 01:25:01,870
I think that you brought
up fucking good point,

1432
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:04,510
which is here's a rack,

1433
01:25:04,780 --> 01:25:05,220
right?

1434
01:25:05,220 --> 01:25:09,670
And and for a long time we were supporting
Iraq and then we'd support it ran

1435
01:25:09,680 --> 01:25:11,860
their biggest enemy and they
wouldn't support a rack again.

1436
01:25:12,070 --> 01:25:13,780
And then we'd support around.
Why?

1437
01:25:13,781 --> 01:25:18,730
Because we want a cheapo fine
geopolitics actually. Who gives a fuck?

1438
01:25:18,731 --> 01:25:22,150
Actually, you know we're hegemonic power.
That's what we have to do. Whatever

1439
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:26,800
the problem is is you say,
okay, we meet up shit.

1440
01:25:26,840 --> 01:25:30,500
This is where it gets a bit Wonky, right?
Because you're like, if you wanted,

1441
01:25:30,540 --> 01:25:33,860
if you just told the American people
we need to fucking oil and this guy is

1442
01:25:33,861 --> 01:25:35,160
fucking fucking with oil,

1443
01:25:35,460 --> 01:25:38,920
I think that would have been better than
weapons of mass destruction and going

1444
01:25:38,921 --> 01:25:41,790
to the UN and trying to get
everybody behind it and try it.

1445
01:25:41,910 --> 01:25:45,360
W we understand that we are
geopolitical player where the policemen,

1446
01:25:45,361 --> 01:25:47,280
the world's policemen,
you don't have to make this shit up.

1447
01:25:47,281 --> 01:25:52,281
But what happened is they said Al-qaida
is being supported by Sadam Hussein.

1448
01:25:53,670 --> 01:25:54,240
Now,

1449
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:59,240
anyone want to have a brain knows that
alcaide is fundamentalist religion and

1450
01:25:59,761 --> 01:26:02,550
the bath party was a secular,
they were anti religious.

1451
01:26:02,551 --> 01:26:04,370
They were like political thing.
They were,

1452
01:26:04,371 --> 01:26:08,590
they didn't want religious extremism
so they weren't how helping out kind of

1453
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:12,080
where are they bad guys is Adamus ain't
a bad guy. Yes, I didn't like him.

1454
01:26:12,081 --> 01:26:13,460
He's not my friend.
I don't like him.

1455
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:17,570
But was he fucking Osama bin Laden's
best friend? No, they were enemies.

1456
01:26:17,930 --> 01:26:20,450
In any case,
we make shit up and we go in there.

1457
01:26:21,050 --> 01:26:23,330
We fucked shit up so
bad for so long that we,

1458
01:26:23,331 --> 01:26:28,331
when we leave right after the day we leave
a co a fucking cadre of motherfuckers

1459
01:26:29,420 --> 01:26:30,620
come out called Isis,

1460
01:26:30,770 --> 01:26:34,400
which make Al Chi to look like a fucking
tea party and take over the country.

1461
01:26:34,690 --> 01:26:39,230
Right. It surprising at all. But
hold on. So we go in, we made it up.

1462
01:26:39,290 --> 01:26:41,240
We said the Boogie man lives in Iraq.

1463
01:26:42,140 --> 01:26:45,500
We fuck it up so bad that when we
leave the Boogie man is twice as big.

1464
01:26:45,501 --> 01:26:49,760
And by the way we made them.
Now that is a failure not of our trip,

1465
01:26:49,761 --> 01:26:53,840
but off the fucking State Department
and other political fucking cause.

1466
01:26:53,841 --> 01:26:57,530
These guys, there was a time when the
British could actually say, you know,

1467
01:26:57,531 --> 01:27:02,090
we can make decisions that we are making
decisions that are terribly wrong and

1468
01:27:02,091 --> 01:27:05,960
the saddest part about that as people
are paying for that on our side and on

1469
01:27:05,961 --> 01:27:08,540
their side with their fucking lives.
But isn't that,

1470
01:27:08,570 --> 01:27:11,840
I mean I'm not in any way downplaying

1471
01:27:13,730 --> 01:27:16,100
the troops or any military action,

1472
01:27:16,460 --> 01:27:19,100
but I'm just looking at it from
a purely objective point of view.

1473
01:27:19,130 --> 01:27:24,070
Almost like a mathematics.
He's not a cause and effect
type situation. I mean you,

1474
01:27:24,071 --> 01:27:25,280
you enter into our country,

1475
01:27:25,281 --> 01:27:29,600
you have what is the number of casualties
of civilians in Iraq? It's staggering,

1476
01:27:29,601 --> 01:27:32,210
right? It's like a hundred
to one. It's crazy.

1477
01:27:32,211 --> 01:27:36,680
The amount of that were killed supposedly
somewhere around a million. Yes.

1478
01:27:36,710 --> 01:27:40,430
Including sanctions because
we cut off medicine and shit.

1479
01:27:40,790 --> 01:27:43,010
It's like a million Iraqis.
That's a big number.

1480
01:27:43,011 --> 01:27:46,850
What does anybody in their right mind
think the reaction of those people is

1481
01:27:46,851 --> 01:27:49,700
going to be unless they're so
completely detached from those people?

1482
01:27:49,701 --> 01:27:52,910
On the ground that you don't take that
into account at all when you make your

1483
01:27:52,911 --> 01:27:55,340
decisions. That's my long
winded answer to your question,

1484
01:27:55,341 --> 01:27:58,880
which is if someone did
that to America and said,

1485
01:27:58,910 --> 01:28:00,710
America bombed Russia,

1486
01:28:00,920 --> 01:28:05,390
we clearly did not bomb rush or we
didn't help or whatever, they invaded us,

1487
01:28:05,780 --> 01:28:09,560
killed a million or 10 whatever the
factor is, 10 million to 20 million.

1488
01:28:10,010 --> 01:28:12,350
Everybody including me and you,
we get it.

1489
01:28:12,351 --> 01:28:14,520
We said we were going to kill
those motherfuckers. Yeah,

1490
01:28:14,550 --> 01:28:17,750
we had all have to get down and
that is what's happening now.

1491
01:28:17,930 --> 01:28:21,230
And then everybody's sitting there going,
wow, fuck, we'll just go bomb isis.

1492
01:28:21,231 --> 01:28:24,350
Those ices motherfuckers cutting
people's heads off. Fuck Isis. Fuck Isis.

1493
01:28:24,351 --> 01:28:26,420
And you're like, I agree.
Fuck. I said I'm a journalist.

1494
01:28:26,421 --> 01:28:28,220
They're going to cut my head
off so I don't like them.

1495
01:28:28,820 --> 01:28:32,210
But at the same time you're
sitting there going, okay, why?

1496
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:35,380
Why is no one asking?
Why is no one asking,

1497
01:28:35,480 --> 01:28:37,820
how the fuck did these
motherfuckers become popular?

1498
01:28:38,030 --> 01:28:40,460
How the fuck did they
recruit guys from Virginia?

1499
01:28:40,461 --> 01:28:43,580
How did they recruit guys from France?
How do they recruit guys from England?

1500
01:28:43,970 --> 01:28:48,680
Where the fuck are these guys coming
from and how did they take over Syria and

1501
01:28:48,681 --> 01:28:51,380
fucking Iraq?
When you have every army in the world,

1502
01:28:51,381 --> 01:28:55,790
they're in every fucking commando unit
and every intelligence agency and these

1503
01:28:55,910 --> 01:28:59,720
fucking bunch of new guys, new kids on
the block took over everybody's shit.

1504
01:29:00,170 --> 01:29:02,040
And the reason why is because a,

1505
01:29:02,550 --> 01:29:05,390
there's institutional fucking
money funding them. And B,

1506
01:29:05,391 --> 01:29:07,320
because we fucked up shit bad on our side.

1507
01:29:07,321 --> 01:29:10,620
Now we should take the learnings
that we've done and say, look,

1508
01:29:10,621 --> 01:29:15,570
Isis isn't going anywhere unless
we fucking, you know, go ape shit.

1509
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:20,220
Guess what? It's going to make all kind
of look like a tea party. Good Lord.

1510
01:29:20,221 --> 01:29:23,610
Right when you think that he's brought
the doom and gloom to the highest level

1511
01:29:23,611 --> 01:29:28,110
possible, a new watermark
emerges. This motherfucker,

1512
01:29:29,190 --> 01:29:34,170
I actually love life. I know you
do that love life. I love you.

1513
01:29:34,260 --> 01:29:37,890
I love life so much. Look, I
eat too much. I drank too much.

1514
01:29:38,250 --> 01:29:39,490
I hang out with dudes like you.

1515
01:29:39,660 --> 01:29:42,150
I got to say there's nothing
there with drinking too much,

1516
01:29:42,180 --> 01:29:44,940
but I'll tell you why because
there's nothing better in life.

1517
01:29:44,970 --> 01:29:48,750
And I don't know if you, if you agree
with me, but when you get older,

1518
01:29:50,190 --> 01:29:54,090
besides family, cause family for me is
number one. You have, you know your kids,

1519
01:29:54,120 --> 01:29:57,090
which are everything, but you get a
bit older, you know, but it's shit.

1520
01:29:58,260 --> 01:30:01,830
You have a drink, you have a steak.
You talked to somebody and say, look,

1521
01:30:02,730 --> 01:30:03,570
this is important shit.

1522
01:30:04,980 --> 01:30:09,980
The greatest thing that we have you and
I is that we can talk about this shit

1523
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:15,200
and people actually listen to us because
I believe that people all over America,

1524
01:30:16,530 --> 01:30:19,410
North America, Europe are having
the exact same discussions.

1525
01:30:20,490 --> 01:30:23,580
And unless everybody goes, you
know what, that's fucking true.

1526
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:27,930
These guys are being cock suckers and
fuck isis and we got to stop this fucking

1527
01:30:28,620 --> 01:30:29,453
sea level rise.

1528
01:30:30,390 --> 01:30:34,500
That's the beauty about what we can do
is that we live in a world where we can

1529
01:30:34,501 --> 01:30:38,960
talk and have a few drinks and say what
we believe in. And literally you're,

1530
01:30:38,970 --> 01:30:42,600
I get it every time like, you
know, hundreds of thousands
and tens of thousands,

1531
01:30:42,930 --> 01:30:46,200
Facebook, Twitter, everyone
said, okay good. I'm fucking
down. What do we do next?

1532
01:30:46,260 --> 01:30:50,280
I don't fucking know. I'm
not Jesus Christ. We're just
sitting here and saying,

1533
01:30:50,550 --> 01:30:51,750
this is what I believe in.

1534
01:30:51,751 --> 01:30:56,751
This is what I think the greatest thing
about our lives is that we live a life

1535
01:30:57,421 --> 01:31:01,430
where we can have a discussion and it
actually matters and people will listen to

1536
01:31:01,431 --> 01:31:02,910
them. You can say, what
do we do next? Well,

1537
01:31:02,911 --> 01:31:06,840
I think that's one of the things
that's held back are all cultures,

1538
01:31:06,841 --> 01:31:10,680
is the ability to communicate with each
other and find out that we're more alike

1539
01:31:10,681 --> 01:31:11,760
than we are different.

1540
01:31:11,910 --> 01:31:15,480
We're all just human beings and it
was really difficult to have those

1541
01:31:15,481 --> 01:31:16,560
conversations before.

1542
01:31:16,561 --> 01:31:20,430
It was really difficult to reach people
all over the world and we look at this,

1543
01:31:21,100 --> 01:31:23,700
you know what? Hold on, look
at what you've built here.

1544
01:31:24,360 --> 01:31:28,560
You've built a communication center.
You've built a network. Back in the day,

1545
01:31:28,561 --> 01:31:29,670
this would be NBC.

1546
01:31:30,390 --> 01:31:33,240
People would come in and they'd talk to
her shit and they'd say whatever they

1547
01:31:33,241 --> 01:31:36,840
say, and then they leave Walter
Cronkite. You literally built that here.

1548
01:31:37,170 --> 01:31:41,070
Now it's a lot less prohibitively
expensive than building NBC.

1549
01:31:41,370 --> 01:31:44,310
But that's why whenever I come
here and I tried to come here,

1550
01:31:44,311 --> 01:31:49,140
every time I come to la is
because this is the future of,

1551
01:31:49,170 --> 01:31:52,740
it's NBC,
but it's NBC for our people.

1552
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:56,670
It's on NBC for everyone. Like NBC
used to, there was three channels.

1553
01:31:57,180 --> 01:31:59,980
But one of the things I
love about coming here,

1554
01:31:59,981 --> 01:32:02,500
and this is why I get
rankled about censorship,

1555
01:32:02,501 --> 01:32:06,340
is Joe Rogan has to be able
to say whatever the fuck
he wants. No matter what.

1556
01:32:06,341 --> 01:32:09,580
Shane Smith has to be able to
say whatever the fuck I want,

1557
01:32:09,581 --> 01:32:14,560
no matter what you can say I'm wrong.
You can say fuck you Shane,

1558
01:32:14,561 --> 01:32:19,150
I hate you. You're not allowed to
shoot me without me. Yeah, but,

1559
01:32:19,450 --> 01:32:23,980
but like while we have freedom of
speech and while we have communication,

1560
01:32:23,981 --> 01:32:24,910
why don't we have all this shit?

1561
01:32:24,911 --> 01:32:28,240
We should celebrate the shit out of it
and we should tell everybody else out

1562
01:32:28,241 --> 01:32:30,790
there that they should celebrate the
shit out of it because that's what true

1563
01:32:30,791 --> 01:32:34,570
freedom is. And last we're allowed to
say whatever the fuck we want to say.

1564
01:32:34,870 --> 01:32:38,110
There is no such thing as freedom.
There is no such thing as true freedom.

1565
01:32:38,111 --> 01:32:42,340
If you can't express yourself 100%
it's number one fucked of thing.

1566
01:32:42,341 --> 01:32:43,810
You can buy a gun,
you can do this.

1567
01:32:43,811 --> 01:32:48,811
And if you can't say what you fucking
believe without somebody pointing a gun to

1568
01:32:49,061 --> 01:32:51,820
your head, that was what the
Gestapo did. The Gestapo said,

1569
01:32:51,821 --> 01:32:53,680
you can't say that it will fuck you up.
Well,

1570
01:32:53,681 --> 01:32:57,220
the idea is that they're symbiotic because
you need the gun to be able to say,

1571
01:32:57,221 --> 01:33:00,190
hey, fuck you. I'm going
to say whatever I want.

1572
01:33:00,191 --> 01:33:03,070
I can protect my body with this weapon,
your weapon.

1573
01:33:03,270 --> 01:33:06,910
It's the only thing that I'm wanting
to go to a gun fight whole world.

1574
01:33:06,911 --> 01:33:09,120
It shouldn't get to the gunfight does.

1575
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:12,520
We should be able to say whatever the
fuck we want. And that's in violent.

1576
01:33:12,521 --> 01:33:13,354
And by the way,

1577
01:33:13,750 --> 01:33:17,290
that's what we should be fighting for
when we talk about human rights and when

1578
01:33:17,291 --> 01:33:19,320
we talk about shit,
a lot of time like we were going on,

1579
01:33:19,350 --> 01:33:22,290
Sadam Hussein was a bad guy.
Yeah, there's a lot of bad guy.

1580
01:33:22,300 --> 01:33:25,180
The Hutus and the Tutsis were fucking
kill him the fuck out of each other.

1581
01:33:25,181 --> 01:33:27,340
The exact same chatty.
Exactly.

1582
01:33:27,700 --> 01:33:31,330
So it wasn't about him being a bad guy
because there's a lot of bad guys out

1583
01:33:31,331 --> 01:33:35,600
there. However, what we should fight for
his freedom of speech and that's why he,

1584
01:33:35,601 --> 01:33:39,280
Charlie up door is an important thing
that everybody in the world is coming out.

1585
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:42,010
They're not protesting.
They're saying, you know what?

1586
01:33:42,430 --> 01:33:44,800
Everybody should be able to say
whatever the fuck they want.

1587
01:33:44,970 --> 01:33:46,420
And I believe in that.
Well,

1588
01:33:46,421 --> 01:33:48,910
I think anybody who doesn't
believe in that as a fool,

1589
01:33:49,120 --> 01:33:52,120
but there's a lot of fucking people,
but there's a lot of people.

1590
01:33:52,121 --> 01:33:54,280
Did you hear about what the
fuck is going on? There was a,

1591
01:33:54,281 --> 01:33:59,281
there was another attack while this
app to this Charlie Hebdo thing is Boko

1592
01:33:59,590 --> 01:34:00,423
Haram.
Yeah.

1593
01:34:00,550 --> 01:34:04,990
That was 2000 people killed in
Nigeria by Islamic extremest. Yes.

1594
01:34:05,050 --> 01:34:09,080
But we didn't hear about that
because that's what I'm saying. Yeah,

1595
01:34:09,100 --> 01:34:12,910
well that's true. It's not a fucking
weird thing, man. That's weak.

1596
01:34:13,820 --> 01:34:18,070
It's racism and it's Africa fatigue and,
and quite frankly,

1597
01:34:18,230 --> 01:34:19,120
the different issues,
right?

1598
01:34:19,121 --> 01:34:23,620
One of them is attacking someone because
of freedom of speech. Yeah. This is,

1599
01:34:23,650 --> 01:34:28,120
this is some other, there's some other
motivation, right? I mean there is sadly,

1600
01:34:28,510 --> 01:34:32,560
there is Africa fatigue, much like there's
Afghanistan fatigue or a rack fatigue.

1601
01:34:32,950 --> 01:34:37,630
I mean, how about if, let's take a rack
for example, we left Iraq and said,

1602
01:34:37,631 --> 01:34:42,100
mission accomplished, we
won good, goodbye. And we
left. The story didn't end,

1603
01:34:42,160 --> 01:34:46,330
but we left. Boom. Isis Bank, biggest
story in the world. Oh, well how,

1604
01:34:46,331 --> 01:34:48,640
where the fuck did these guys
come from? Well, if you would, uh,

1605
01:34:48,670 --> 01:34:50,830
not just slept there,
you would have known.

1606
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:54,040
And I think that there's
Africa fatigue for sure.

1607
01:34:54,340 --> 01:34:58,130
Like Ebola actually continues to rise.
The deaths continue to rise.

1608
01:34:58,190 --> 01:34:59,420
If we haven't contained it.

1609
01:34:59,660 --> 01:35:03,570
It's now in Sierra Leone and Guinea and
it's fucking getting worse in, in, in, um,

1610
01:35:04,450 --> 01:35:09,070
in, in Liberia is out of the news cycles.
Therefore it must be fucking over.

1611
01:35:09,090 --> 01:35:14,090
We saw, must have sent the
pill. That works. No, the
deaths fucking increase. The,

1612
01:35:14,091 --> 01:35:16,460
the, the, the, the, the, uh,

1613
01:35:16,550 --> 01:35:20,540
opportunity for contagion increases and,
and everybody,

1614
01:35:20,660 --> 01:35:22,580
that's why we're doing our 24 hour news.

1615
01:35:22,580 --> 01:35:26,330
And that work cause you're like who
gives a fuck about the news cycle?

1616
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:29,900
They found the plane so
therefore every like who cares?

1617
01:35:29,901 --> 01:35:31,760
Like when we left Iraq,

1618
01:35:31,790 --> 01:35:36,110
that's when the problem started and
nobody paid any attention while isis built

1619
01:35:36,111 --> 01:35:36,830
up.

1620
01:35:36,830 --> 01:35:41,830
You know you look at West Africa and you
say Ebola is fucking still raging but

1621
01:35:42,981 --> 01:35:46,790
now it's fucking the nurse didn't
get it in Euston is a world. Okay.

1622
01:35:47,180 --> 01:35:50,840
I mean there is Africa fatigue,
there is Iraq fatigue,

1623
01:35:50,870 --> 01:35:54,380
there is around fatigue and it's like
now we're going to enter into domestic

1624
01:35:54,381 --> 01:35:58,040
elections and we'll be, we'll be
fascinated with what goes on there.

1625
01:35:58,070 --> 01:36:01,850
Well it's almost like it never ends like
this is a fractal equation because as

1626
01:36:01,851 --> 01:36:05,330
you start looking at all
the various aspects of our
culture that we could change,

1627
01:36:05,331 --> 01:36:07,370
it could be better and we
look at life and death,

1628
01:36:07,390 --> 01:36:09,990
but that's just look at the desks that
we have in this country because the

1629
01:36:10,070 --> 01:36:11,360
cigarettes,
I don't have anything,

1630
01:36:11,361 --> 01:36:14,360
any problem with people smoking
cigarettes if you truly want to write.

1631
01:36:14,360 --> 01:36:18,180
But the fact that that's
like sort of this ignore if,

1632
01:36:18,250 --> 01:36:20,660
if everyone stood back,
if everyone,

1633
01:36:20,661 --> 01:36:25,130
like the entire government like had like
a holes anti cigarette week where they

1634
01:36:25,131 --> 01:36:30,080
said in every day on the news
they broadcast is special
about this is a person

1635
01:36:30,081 --> 01:36:32,960
who started smoking when they're
16, who either are, when they're 15,

1636
01:36:32,961 --> 01:36:36,320
getting half their throat removed
and show that shit on television.

1637
01:36:36,530 --> 01:36:39,860
How long would it be before the numbers
just radically dropped and the number of

1638
01:36:39,861 --> 01:36:44,690
people that you saw dead. Yeah, every
year radically dropped from cancer.

1639
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:46,610
It would be gigantic.
Huge.

1640
01:36:46,611 --> 01:36:51,590
But then we get back into
the whole freedom of speech
thing, which is, you know,

1641
01:36:51,830 --> 01:36:55,910
what isn't that freedom of speech?
It is free to but like when,

1642
01:36:55,911 --> 01:37:00,200
when government gets involved in
social issues and messaging thing.

1643
01:37:00,230 --> 01:37:04,220
Well but what's the social
issue? But that's a social
issue if you look up. Okay,

1644
01:37:04,221 --> 01:37:08,960
but let's look at the social issue
that will say no, that was uh,

1645
01:37:08,990 --> 01:37:12,950
um, Obamacare, which by the way,
calling like a affordable healthcare.

1646
01:37:12,951 --> 01:37:15,140
Obamacare is funny cause
you're just labeling Obama.

1647
01:37:15,710 --> 01:37:19,730
And if you look at it just as if you
take a step back, and by the way,

1648
01:37:19,731 --> 01:37:22,880
I don't want to get embroiled
into it cause I am not an expert.

1649
01:37:22,881 --> 01:37:27,500
But globally you're like universal health
care is like a thing like people you

1650
01:37:27,501 --> 01:37:29,270
know should be yeah or
so health care whenever.

1651
01:37:30,020 --> 01:37:34,190
Now granted I come from Canada where
universal health care when I grew up was

1652
01:37:34,191 --> 01:37:35,930
good.
However that said,

1653
01:37:36,380 --> 01:37:41,380
I'm not a huge believer in the government
running anything because governments I

1654
01:37:42,020 --> 01:37:42,501
believe,

1655
01:37:42,501 --> 01:37:47,501
cause I grew up in a government town are
inefficient and they spend 80% of the

1656
01:37:47,901 --> 01:37:50,300
money on themselves and 20% on the thing.

1657
01:37:50,301 --> 01:37:54,830
So I'm not like a huge
believer in government doing
anything that said universal

1658
01:37:55,040 --> 01:37:59,040
care for the richest country in the world
seems like fucking we should have it.

1659
01:37:59,430 --> 01:38:04,430
That became the greatest single debate
and probably the worst thing for

1660
01:38:05,190 --> 01:38:06,840
definitely a Obama,

1661
01:38:06,841 --> 01:38:11,010
but for sure maybe up there and top
five for the Democratic Party and, and,

1662
01:38:11,020 --> 01:38:14,670
and essentially it was like a thing
that if you looked at it in the world

1663
01:38:14,671 --> 01:38:15,504
context,

1664
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:20,790
every rich industrial country as
universal healthcare. So it's a boring,

1665
01:38:20,791 --> 01:38:22,500
it's a fucking given.
It's a nothing.

1666
01:38:22,950 --> 01:38:26,880
And that became such a fucking huge
thing because it was the government

1667
01:38:26,910 --> 01:38:29,700
interfering into

1668
01:38:31,620 --> 01:38:34,890
your private life. Right.
And because of that,

1669
01:38:34,920 --> 01:38:36,750
the extrapolation became a thing.

1670
01:38:37,230 --> 01:38:41,370
And I found that to be an amazing litness
test on the American psyche because

1671
01:38:41,371 --> 01:38:46,290
you sit there and say, I mean
quite frankly, who the fuck cares,

1672
01:38:46,920 --> 01:38:50,460
right? You know, how much money
were miss spending on healthcare?

1673
01:38:50,760 --> 01:38:54,960
I get taxed more in America than I
did in Canada in Communist Canada.

1674
01:38:55,230 --> 01:38:59,880
I get taxed more in America and the
fucking money gets thrown down the toilet.

1675
01:39:00,180 --> 01:39:01,470
I, you know, I would,

1676
01:39:01,530 --> 01:39:06,530
I would be a fucking tea
party motherfucker on the
taxation side because you tax

1677
01:39:06,701 --> 01:39:10,440
me the saving Canada, but the schools
suck in the hospital, suck, whatever.

1678
01:39:10,620 --> 01:39:12,690
But you have to have universal healthcare.

1679
01:39:12,930 --> 01:39:16,410
You cannot be the richest country in the
world and have fucking people dying on

1680
01:39:16,411 --> 01:39:19,700
the street and just rotting there
because, well, fuck, you know, they,

1681
01:39:20,430 --> 01:39:25,080
they couldn't afford it. Now
was it implemented? Well,
no, it wasn't messaged. Well,

1682
01:39:25,081 --> 01:39:25,650
no,

1683
01:39:25,650 --> 01:39:30,320
but the political war that went over
over something as stupid as fucking

1684
01:39:30,330 --> 01:39:34,890
universal, universal healthcare, stupid
to argue about. Yeah. Just becomes like,

1685
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:37,560
we're going to fucking
argue about everything now.

1686
01:39:37,680 --> 01:39:41,880
Every single fucking thing we are going
to, we're going to argue about it.

1687
01:39:41,881 --> 01:39:43,050
Can we fund the government?

1688
01:39:43,320 --> 01:39:47,070
We're going to argue about fucking
are we going to pay our own debt?

1689
01:39:47,100 --> 01:39:48,570
We're going to argue about,

1690
01:39:48,840 --> 01:39:52,620
you know what shoe we put on the right
foot versus the left one and that's the

1691
01:39:52,621 --> 01:39:57,300
problem is if you talk to portray us
who now I was up against charges but a

1692
01:39:57,360 --> 01:39:58,560
secretary gates,
anyone,

1693
01:39:58,830 --> 01:40:03,830
they will all tell you the greatest
fear or the great story of the greatest

1694
01:40:04,381 --> 01:40:07,980
problem for American security is
the inaction of the government.

1695
01:40:07,980 --> 01:40:12,980
The government cannot enact fucking
anything and that is the problem that you

1696
01:40:13,021 --> 01:40:16,740
have today is you have something like
like affordable health care act just

1697
01:40:16,741 --> 01:40:19,890
becoming a huge politicized issue where
someone should have just said, look,

1698
01:40:20,310 --> 01:40:25,300
it's going to cost us 0.01% of the fucking
thing to make universal healthcare,

1699
01:40:25,320 --> 01:40:27,570
which we can't fucking
hold her how it heads up.

1700
01:40:27,571 --> 01:40:31,350
If we don't have just fucking do it was
shut up and fucking get on with fucking

1701
01:40:31,351 --> 01:40:32,490
whatever the fuck else it is.

1702
01:40:32,730 --> 01:40:35,190
It became the number one political
issue of last year. And guess what?

1703
01:40:35,220 --> 01:40:38,940
It's a nonissue. It's a non issue.
We're sitting here, we don't have water,

1704
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:43,900
we don't have fucking water. Think
already fixed that Bro. Fix it. Fix it.

1705
01:40:43,940 --> 01:40:48,010
Sell my pipeline pipeline to Antarctica.
It's the pipelines of the big ice ICU.

1706
01:40:48,180 --> 01:40:52,800
No problem dude. You just develop like
a funnel. You know what I'm saying?

1707
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:54,710
And to funnel Marco's,

1708
01:40:54,850 --> 01:40:59,850
it'll just be like eco warriors
with dreads and sandals.

1709
01:41:00,250 --> 01:41:01,800
Yeah,
we would find out that anyway,

1710
01:41:01,810 --> 01:41:04,690
it's been peeing in the funnel and
everybody would get really pissed. Yeah.

1711
01:41:04,890 --> 01:41:08,660
This is bullshit. There's
no, there's no fix.

1712
01:41:08,661 --> 01:41:10,930
But I think we've been in
constant turmoil for so long.

1713
01:41:10,931 --> 01:41:15,931
I wonder if when something happens like
isis or something along those lines

1714
01:41:16,391 --> 01:41:20,380
where there's a real like
military movement against
this big machine is America.

1715
01:41:20,620 --> 01:41:24,410
I wonder if it excites like some sort
of garden DNA. Yeah. Got It. Yeah.

1716
01:41:24,490 --> 01:41:28,240
Cause I know, I know. I know that
I'm hunting does, and you know,

1717
01:41:28,241 --> 01:41:31,750
what else does farming man, you
know, growing your own vegetables,

1718
01:41:31,900 --> 01:41:34,870
there's something about plucking your
own vegetables and slicing into it and

1719
01:41:34,871 --> 01:41:39,020
making a salad with that tomato that
amazed that there's something primal. Oh,

1720
01:41:39,021 --> 01:41:43,360
it's good. I believe that that rule would
also tastes better. It does. It does.

1721
01:41:43,750 --> 01:41:46,570
I was listening to hold on.
It probably tastes better just in general.

1722
01:41:46,571 --> 01:41:48,160
It's probably better
for it, you know? But,

1723
01:41:48,180 --> 01:41:53,180
but psychologically it tastes
better because I made that 100%.

1724
01:41:53,290 --> 01:41:58,240
Definitely. I couldn't agree
more, but I feel like VOD could,

1725
01:41:58,241 --> 01:42:00,520
that I make doesn't tastes
better than this. You make vodka.

1726
01:42:00,730 --> 01:42:05,350
I've made every boozy you, I'll taste
it tastes like fucking it's potato.

1727
01:42:05,440 --> 01:42:06,273
It's just,

1728
01:42:06,310 --> 01:42:10,990
you can make a still and fermentation
and it tastes like everything tastes like

1729
01:42:11,380 --> 01:42:14,410
Shitty, awful moonshine, terrible vodka.

1730
01:42:14,411 --> 01:42:19,411
What they do is they just refine away
just so it tastes like nothing because you

1731
01:42:19,571 --> 01:42:22,960
never, I mean, vodka doesn't taste
like, hey, just add some shit.

1732
01:42:22,961 --> 01:42:24,350
And have you ever seen those tests?

1733
01:42:25,500 --> 01:42:29,160
You know that that doesn't taste like
Jack and they put it into the barrels? Oh,

1734
01:42:29,250 --> 01:42:31,300
they barrels the barrels,

1735
01:42:31,301 --> 01:42:34,990
stain it and taste it and that's otherwise
it would just tastes like fucking bar.

1736
01:42:35,260 --> 01:42:37,870
Oh alcohol's just alcohol.
Right.

1737
01:42:37,871 --> 01:42:40,870
And add the barrels and the whiskey
barrels like coal and stuff. Right.

1738
01:42:40,871 --> 01:42:44,440
They burn them burn. That's why
it's so yummy and it's fucking good.

1739
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:49,360
Best Jack 10 is the best. I'm going, you
know what Merck, but hold on, you can,

1740
01:42:49,390 --> 01:42:53,020
you can order all the, the, the super
high end shit and whatever else by,

1741
01:42:53,080 --> 01:42:56,440
I believe Jack is the best tasting,
you know, but it's not bourbon.

1742
01:42:56,441 --> 01:43:00,090
Apparently it's a mash or calm,

1743
01:43:00,820 --> 01:43:03,400
calm of our great country.
I do, I do like Jack,

1744
01:43:04,020 --> 01:43:07,710
what I was going to say was that
someone took a cheap bottle of vodka.

1745
01:43:07,711 --> 01:43:11,410
I import it through those Brita water
filters and did it like seven or eight

1746
01:43:11,411 --> 01:43:15,630
times and it came out as good as
any vodka. Smirnoff always wins.

1747
01:43:15,631 --> 01:43:20,631
SMIRNOFF's like $5 a leader and it's
all and they always win the taste test

1748
01:43:21,011 --> 01:43:24,040
cause you know why? Cause it tastes like
fucking nuts. They put sugar in there.

1749
01:43:24,730 --> 01:43:27,410
Well, I don't think they put shit
and they just put alcohol in there.

1750
01:43:28,270 --> 01:43:32,680
That is weird. That drinks
are not supposed to taste
good. They taste good. Yeah.

1751
01:43:32,681 --> 01:43:37,300
You fucking pussy. What do you got? A
little umbrella and you drink in a cherry.

1752
01:43:37,360 --> 01:43:42,100
That's true. That's true. That's weird.
Cause I always, when I was a kid,

1753
01:43:42,101 --> 01:43:46,000
I used to pretend this says
something about the psyche,

1754
01:43:46,240 --> 01:43:49,150
but I would drink coca cola
out of like a shot glass.

1755
01:43:49,390 --> 01:43:53,960
Oh Jesus Christ kid.
And I always thought this is the greatest.

1756
01:43:54,110 --> 01:43:54,831
And by the way,

1757
01:43:54,831 --> 01:43:59,831
if they had a drink that was like coca
cola but like was like I would drink the

1758
01:43:59,961 --> 01:44:03,170
fuck out of that. Cause
I, I love Coca Cola.

1759
01:44:04,010 --> 01:44:07,850
I try not to talk about that cause he
have an issue with that fucking hate Pepsi

1760
01:44:08,150 --> 01:44:10,100
don't drink it often will not drink.

1761
01:44:10,100 --> 01:44:13,780
Jim Norton is the same way by
the Pepsi is like a sugary Wa.

1762
01:44:14,230 --> 01:44:19,070
Coca Cola is the greatest carbolic
acid that ever existed. The, the radio.

1763
01:44:19,860 --> 01:44:22,160
But you know, people used to
have the taste tests. Right.

1764
01:44:22,220 --> 01:44:24,840
I don't know why I'm looking to
you for vindication. I took Jamie,

1765
01:44:24,890 --> 01:44:26,750
they would do the taste
test and you'd be like,

1766
01:44:26,780 --> 01:44:29,840
if you can't taste the difference
between coke and Pepsi, you're fucking,

1767
01:44:29,960 --> 01:44:34,190
I hate your guts because
they're completely different
fucking thing. In any case,

1768
01:44:34,340 --> 01:44:39,340
I always pretend and I've always been
waiting for a drink that's going to be as

1769
01:44:39,410 --> 01:44:44,410
powerful and amazing and hit you as hard
as a coca cola and every time you have

1770
01:44:44,571 --> 01:44:48,890
one it's just, mine are really
disappointing. I love whiskey. Right?

1771
01:44:49,130 --> 01:44:51,170
But if whisky tastes like Coca Cola

1772
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:56,720
fucking drink alone, you can't. Yeah.

1773
01:44:56,721 --> 01:44:59,540
If whiskey Tracy like cocoa, we'd
have a real problem. It's contrary.

1774
01:44:59,940 --> 01:45:02,630
You don't have to feel it.
I think one of the good things about

1775
01:45:05,030 --> 01:45:08,180
one of the good things about
whiskey or about Tequila,

1776
01:45:08,870 --> 01:45:13,010
you feel it when it's going down.
You know you've done something terrible.

1777
01:45:13,520 --> 01:45:16,310
Like you take a shot of Jack Daniels
and it hits you and just like, well,

1778
01:45:16,910 --> 01:45:20,660
you brought up a very good point because
I just got back from a week in Vegas.

1779
01:45:21,020 --> 01:45:21,853
Right.

1780
01:45:22,130 --> 01:45:26,870
And it's a very good point because if
you asked me what I really like to drink,

1781
01:45:26,871 --> 01:45:29,180
like if I wanted to drink,
so I like Irish whiskey,

1782
01:45:29,210 --> 01:45:31,910
I liked shitty Irish whiskey on ice.

1783
01:45:32,480 --> 01:45:36,020
And then number two would be like,
I like to drink. You know, we,

1784
01:45:36,021 --> 01:45:39,110
you and I like meat. So like I like to
eat a steak with a glass of red wine.

1785
01:45:39,111 --> 01:45:41,150
I think state with a glass of red wine.

1786
01:45:42,050 --> 01:45:46,350
It was like a reaffirmation of life.
Right?

1787
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:52,520
But what the fuck do I really
drink? I drink vodka soda. Why? Why?

1788
01:45:52,970 --> 01:45:54,500
Cause it's a fucking drunks,
frank.

1789
01:45:54,530 --> 01:45:56,960
And you can drink when you're
at Vegas and you're playing,

1790
01:45:57,380 --> 01:46:02,180
you can drink 50 vodka sodas and just
be like, there's the water in there.

1791
01:46:02,181 --> 01:46:06,620
It's the purest of the spirit. And was
like, if you drink 50 fucking Jack,

1792
01:46:06,650 --> 01:46:09,470
you're fighting the crew Pa,
you're shitting on the floor,

1793
01:46:09,830 --> 01:46:13,850
you're running a vodka. Soda
is like, you're rehydrate.

1794
01:46:14,030 --> 01:46:18,410
It's a drunk drink. You can drink a vodka
soda forever. Also. Do you ever get sick?

1795
01:46:18,411 --> 01:46:20,720
Like, you know when you're drinking
a lot of whiskey at the end of it,

1796
01:46:20,721 --> 01:46:23,510
you're like, I never want to drink
another whisk again. Vodka soda.

1797
01:46:23,511 --> 01:46:25,760
You wake up the next day
and say, Oh, Vodka Soda.

1798
01:46:26,210 --> 01:46:31,190
Like that's scary because I'm now
so old and I've drank so much booze.

1799
01:46:31,191 --> 01:46:31,880
Then I'm like,

1800
01:46:31,880 --> 01:46:35,830
well can you drink 5,000 of those cars
if you can rank 5,000 of them, I'll go,

1801
01:46:36,020 --> 01:46:38,510
which is a vodka soda. That
seems ridiculous. So you,

1802
01:46:38,511 --> 01:46:41,000
so you honestly believed that
whiskey gets you into fights.

1803
01:46:41,460 --> 01:46:44,120
I think that's going on brown
liquor as a punchy liquor,

1804
01:46:44,121 --> 01:46:45,840
my friend and you know it doesn't,
uh,

1805
01:46:45,990 --> 01:46:50,990
I come from a long line brick carrying
savages or I'm always drank brown liquor,

1806
01:46:51,541 --> 01:46:54,480
eyes the clear liquor.
Brown liquor is a punchy liquor.

1807
01:46:54,600 --> 01:46:57,660
I don't like the clear liquor. I drink
the Mexican version of clear liquor.

1808
01:46:57,661 --> 01:47:02,540
I don't trust that Russian shit. Well,
so Keela we'll keep you up block.

1809
01:47:02,590 --> 01:47:06,300
We'll keep you up. I'm always been Jack
Brown liquor. We'll keep you punching.

1810
01:47:06,301 --> 01:47:08,970
You know that. That's what the fuck
you, why do you think you do a fighter?

1811
01:47:08,980 --> 01:47:12,600
You got the kettle bells and
kicking in the fighting. He's like,

1812
01:47:13,290 --> 01:47:14,970
Jack Daniel's a poor decision making.

1813
01:47:15,420 --> 01:47:17,460
I don't think it's the
carbon inside the barrel.

1814
01:47:17,461 --> 01:47:20,760
I mean you yourself said that alcohol
is the same effect. It's, it's,

1815
01:47:21,070 --> 01:47:24,990
it's shine with a bit of fucking
burn wood in it. But by the way,

1816
01:47:24,991 --> 01:47:27,120
it's a gorgeous one of the
managers at the comedy store,

1817
01:47:27,121 --> 01:47:30,810
Terrence has a fuck some
fucking ridiculous moonshine
that he brought from pack

1818
01:47:30,811 --> 01:47:33,030
home. Oh yeah. Moonshine to wake you up.

1819
01:47:33,510 --> 01:47:37,440
But the reason why I like
cheap Irish was some, yeah.

1820
01:47:37,710 --> 01:47:41,420
The reason why I like cheap Irish whiskey,
new glasses is a,

1821
01:47:41,460 --> 01:47:45,790
cause they run it through Pete, which
is, you know, bog bricks that they like.

1822
01:47:45,810 --> 01:47:49,650
It tastes like fucking grass basically.
And it's just moonshine.

1823
01:47:49,651 --> 01:47:51,810
It tastes like grass. I'm like,
Oh fuck whiskey. I love it.

1824
01:47:52,140 --> 01:47:56,550
I just fucking moonshine.
GRAPPA is just fucking moonshot.

1825
01:47:56,551 --> 01:47:57,361
But they put it in the,

1826
01:47:57,361 --> 01:48:00,750
in the fancy bottles and shit and your
lights fucking moonshot. It's disgusting.

1827
01:48:00,751 --> 01:48:01,950
It's the same fucking thing.
Yeah.

1828
01:48:02,520 --> 01:48:06,900
My grandparents used to have that
shit will just drink it after a meal.

1829
01:48:07,210 --> 01:48:08,700
I don't know.
Just to tolerate each other.

1830
01:48:08,701 --> 01:48:12,720
I've got to say that we've talked
about how the world's about 10.

1831
01:48:12,870 --> 01:48:15,060
I've never felt better about humanity,

1832
01:48:15,061 --> 01:48:17,640
that I feel bad because
I've had a few drinks.

1833
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:21,690
I don't know why alcohol is considered
a depressant cause I'm fucking euphoric

1834
01:48:21,691 --> 01:48:26,050
as fuck when I drink it. After the effect,
it's, he crushes your immune system.

1835
01:48:26,051 --> 01:48:30,890
It's immunosuppressant. It's bad for
protein synthesis. This Brad is new.

1836
01:48:30,900 --> 01:48:35,340
Hydrates you, it's, I know
it's bad for fat burning.

1837
01:48:35,880 --> 01:48:38,450
I've experienced that first thing,
different kinds of lunchtime.

1838
01:48:38,460 --> 01:48:43,460
We have the real issue with alcohol is
the dehydration and the liver toxicity.

1839
01:48:44,320 --> 01:48:49,260
Oh, that's it. Yeah. We're doing a
piece, actually I can I be fucking,

1840
01:48:49,290 --> 01:48:53,850
uh, positive for once in my misery life.
You do want a piece that's positive. Okay.

1841
01:48:53,851 --> 01:48:58,560
So my favorite piece I've ever done,
I'm doing right now and I was at this,

1842
01:48:58,561 --> 01:49:01,520
uh, conference. This is moonshine and, uh,

1843
01:49:02,070 --> 01:49:05,560
well now it's about to get
unintelligible if I get into that shit.

1844
01:49:05,790 --> 01:49:08,110
But I'm going to,

1845
01:49:08,170 --> 01:49:11,060
so I'm going to try to get my
last intelligence story out.

1846
01:49:12,420 --> 01:49:16,800
So I was at this conference
and there was just amazing.

1847
01:49:16,890 --> 01:49:20,520
Um, uh, I dunno,

1848
01:49:20,640 --> 01:49:24,690
presentation about a guy
who was a researcher,

1849
01:49:24,720 --> 01:49:29,430
HIV researcher and h they are,
they're like HIV,

1850
01:49:29,460 --> 01:49:33,750
HIV, uh, you know each t-cells, it eats,

1851
01:49:33,780 --> 01:49:38,520
it eats human cells is amazing at
eating shit. It's amazing at eating.

1852
01:49:38,521 --> 01:49:41,820
Sell moonshine.
Now you're going to get me fucked up.

1853
01:49:41,821 --> 01:49:45,090
I'm going to start crying again. So what
are you saying? AIDS. You have aids.

1854
01:49:47,200 --> 01:49:51,850
Okay. So whoa, that's good.
That's actually the best
shit. That's pretty good.

1855
01:49:51,851 --> 01:49:53,920
I have here.
That's a real God damn America again.

1856
01:49:53,921 --> 01:49:56,710
Like I'm going to have one more
before I finished this. By the way,

1857
01:49:56,711 --> 01:49:57,790
the story is going to fuck you up.

1858
01:49:57,791 --> 01:50:01,700
So everybody turn it up now
because this is important. Okay?

1859
01:50:04,300 --> 01:50:05,133
Okay.

1860
01:50:05,500 --> 01:50:10,090
So they figure out HIV is
amazing at eating t-cells,

1861
01:50:10,180 --> 01:50:12,910
right? So they say,
what if like a pit bull,

1862
01:50:13,480 --> 01:50:17,530
we starve the HIV and then we
only feed it cancer, right?

1863
01:50:18,550 --> 01:50:21,220
Guess what happens?
It's fucking works like a charm.

1864
01:50:21,730 --> 01:50:25,600
So they starve the HIV, they
genetically reintroduce it. So if it,

1865
01:50:25,650 --> 01:50:29,950
if HIV doesn't eat your t cells, it's
not a problem to you, but at each cancer,

1866
01:50:29,951 --> 01:50:34,240
so it's a cancer reader. So I'm watching
this thing go and hold on. When HIV AIDS,

1867
01:50:34,241 --> 01:50:39,040
cancer, cancer, each HIV, HIV
is an EAD or HIV, each cells,

1868
01:50:39,070 --> 01:50:39,580
right?

1869
01:50:39,580 --> 01:50:44,080
So like why don't we starve it for
t cells and feed it cancer cells.

1870
01:50:44,830 --> 01:50:48,010
And it worked. In fact, they'd
been in four years of trials,

1871
01:50:48,011 --> 01:50:52,150
a hundred percent success, right? And
it's going to, it's, it's a blood cancer,

1872
01:50:52,151 --> 01:50:56,350
so it's a leukemia. And so what,
what happened? So I started saying,

1873
01:50:56,351 --> 01:51:00,680
well holy fuck cause my mom had
cancer and my step mom died of cancer,

1874
01:51:00,681 --> 01:51:05,260
of everyone's had somebody affected
by cancer. So I'm like, Holy Shit,

1875
01:51:05,650 --> 01:51:10,350
they reengineered HIV to
go out and any cancer.

1876
01:51:10,360 --> 01:51:10,871
And then they're like,

1877
01:51:10,871 --> 01:51:14,860
well actually now what they're doing is
a reengineering viruses for different

1878
01:51:14,861 --> 01:51:19,210
cancers. So for example,
the Mayo Clinic re, re, re,

1879
01:51:19,690 --> 01:51:20,260
uh,

1880
01:51:20,260 --> 01:51:24,910
engineered measles and they're injecting
like a billion measles into a bone

1881
01:51:24,911 --> 01:51:28,680
cancer in the bar. And you
see a PR, one woman had, uh,

1882
01:51:28,750 --> 01:51:30,880
a golf ball size tumor in her head.

1883
01:51:31,330 --> 01:51:35,830
And then like the injector with measles
and the fucking measles eat the cancer,

1884
01:51:35,831 --> 01:51:37,780
like eat it. And so the, the, the, the,

1885
01:51:38,290 --> 01:51:43,270
which was previously an operable just
goes away. What the fuck? So there's,

1886
01:51:43,300 --> 01:51:46,330
there's, in Houston they're
doing it, uh, in, in,

1887
01:51:46,331 --> 01:51:50,950
in Mayo Clinic in Penn state.
And uh, in Ottawa, Canada,

1888
01:51:50,951 --> 01:51:55,951
the guy who first discovered it was a
guy who came across this paper where

1889
01:51:56,291 --> 01:51:58,780
hookers,
who used to get cervical cancer,

1890
01:51:58,781 --> 01:52:03,190
all she used to get rabies because a,
they were living in squalor.

1891
01:52:03,191 --> 01:52:05,470
So they would inject
the women with rabies.

1892
01:52:05,471 --> 01:52:09,580
And then there were cervical cancer
would go away because the viruses eat to

1893
01:52:09,581 --> 01:52:12,360
cancer. So this is, by the way, I'm,

1894
01:52:12,940 --> 01:52:16,780
I must be drunk because I'm giving you
my biggest scoop on HBO that's coming up

1895
01:52:16,781 --> 01:52:20,560
on our new season. But, so I went
to interview all these doctors.

1896
01:52:20,561 --> 01:52:22,540
I went to say like,
what the fuck's going on?

1897
01:52:22,541 --> 01:52:26,800
And they've re-engineered these
viruses that used to kill us, right?

1898
01:52:27,070 --> 01:52:30,790
To go eat cancer. And I'm
like, is this the first step,

1899
01:52:30,791 --> 01:52:35,750
not just for a treatment that
isn't, um, a radiation or, uh,

1900
01:52:36,660 --> 01:52:41,650
um, go on pharmaceutical
base. Yeah. Chemo,

1901
01:52:41,651 --> 01:52:45,700
Chemo, Chemo, uh, but
actually, uh, uh, know,

1902
01:52:46,130 --> 01:52:48,630
uh, treatment that doesn't
fuck you up and that, yeah.

1903
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:50,840
And puts it you in recession,
they're like,

1904
01:52:50,841 --> 01:52:54,290
we're looking at the first step towards
a cure. So this is the biggest story

1905
01:52:54,560 --> 01:52:58,060
or the opening scene in 28 days later.

1906
01:52:59,760 --> 01:53:04,270
Oh, oh, oh, yeah. Right, right, right,
right, right. Well, they actually,

1907
01:53:04,271 --> 01:53:08,970
so they re-engineer, they reengineer
the virus. The virus, for example,

1908
01:53:08,971 --> 01:53:13,971
the measles virus actually comes from
1953 and it's the kid whose throat culture

1909
01:53:15,041 --> 01:53:19,840
they took that we've been using as a
measles virus for the last however long

1910
01:53:20,200 --> 01:53:22,600
these guys in Houston
or using a cold virus,

1911
01:53:22,601 --> 01:53:24,910
which were all immune to the HIV one,

1912
01:53:24,911 --> 01:53:29,620
they actually reprogram so
that it doesn't, uh, uh,

1913
01:53:29,680 --> 01:53:30,700
eat our t cells.

1914
01:53:30,970 --> 01:53:35,800
But what's incredibly interesting about
that is these guys figured out that what

1915
01:53:35,801 --> 01:53:40,801
happened was cancer puts our immune system
to sleep and so that viruses activate

1916
01:53:43,361 --> 01:53:48,310
our immune system. So the virus just
goes into the cancer, says, here it is.

1917
01:53:48,311 --> 01:53:51,670
And then the immune system goes and
eats it. So for the past six months,

1918
01:53:51,671 --> 01:53:55,900
I've met the top five or six medical
teams in the world as they explain this

1919
01:53:55,901 --> 01:53:58,690
shit to me and I'm thick as fuck.
So I didn't get half of it.

1920
01:53:58,990 --> 01:54:03,990
But what's interesting about it is the
first step to curing cancer caused by the

1921
01:54:04,961 --> 01:54:09,180
shit that used to kill us because measles
used to kill like 150 million people a

1922
01:54:09,181 --> 01:54:10,840
year. It was a fucking
worst thing you could get.

1923
01:54:11,380 --> 01:54:16,210
Now the measles brings all the fucking
white cells and eats the cancer.

1924
01:54:16,510 --> 01:54:18,130
It's absolutely fantastic.

1925
01:54:18,490 --> 01:54:21,820
And that's my happy thing before
we get drunk on the moonshine.

1926
01:54:21,850 --> 01:54:24,340
Give you some more on that.
Excuse me.

1927
01:54:24,430 --> 01:54:26,590
That's insane. Yeah, that makes sense.

1928
01:54:26,650 --> 01:54:29,190
And it also seems terrifying
because if they fucked that up,

1929
01:54:29,191 --> 01:54:29,990
then you got some crazy,

1930
01:54:29,990 --> 01:54:33,800
well they go through incredible protocols
and I wish I could just show you this

1931
01:54:33,801 --> 01:54:38,660
stuff, but I'm covered in
NBC Dwu suits and Shit. They
go through very, and the uh,

1932
01:54:38,690 --> 01:54:39,950
you know, the, they're, they're,

1933
01:54:39,951 --> 01:54:43,280
they're making sure that the viruses
are done in the correct way and stuff,

1934
01:54:43,610 --> 01:54:48,240
but I've got to say, oh yeah,
but how it all happens is there,

1935
01:54:48,241 --> 01:54:51,980
they're like, it happened by mistake.
Like it happened by like, oh,

1936
01:54:51,981 --> 01:54:54,650
this fucking we're working on HIV.

1937
01:54:54,860 --> 01:54:59,720
That thing actually eats cancer,
you know? And, and I think that,

1938
01:54:59,990 --> 01:55:04,100
you know, when I look at stuff, I'm
like, we can solve these problems.

1939
01:55:04,820 --> 01:55:08,570
We can fix these problems. When we
get on here, we're always like, wow,

1940
01:55:08,571 --> 01:55:13,280
fucking Russia as this and isis is this.
We can fix the problems.

1941
01:55:13,281 --> 01:55:15,800
We just have to foot people
on it. And My, you know,

1942
01:55:15,801 --> 01:55:18,650
Larry Page always says the guy runs.
Google is always like,

1943
01:55:19,010 --> 01:55:22,370
that's a zero million dollar problem.
Meaning if it's a problem,

1944
01:55:22,380 --> 01:55:24,360
only if you put zero million dollars into,

1945
01:55:24,400 --> 01:55:26,350
you pick up $1 million and
the guest what you saw,

1946
01:55:27,080 --> 01:55:28,910
zero million dollar problems.
Yeah.

1947
01:55:31,190 --> 01:55:35,540
There's a lot of those to the lungs, just
on purpose. And I don't mean on purpose,

1948
01:55:35,541 --> 01:55:39,210
meaning there's some sort of
a grand scheme, sort of a,

1949
01:55:39,211 --> 01:55:43,160
the overlying conspiracy
to the way the world runs.

1950
01:55:43,770 --> 01:55:46,440
I often wonder the way people behave,

1951
01:55:46,680 --> 01:55:48,990
even the way you see
people behave when they,

1952
01:55:49,320 --> 01:55:53,190
when they know they're in a relationship
where their husband's never going to

1953
01:55:53,191 --> 01:55:57,300
leave or their wife has never going to
leave, or they know they're in a job.

1954
01:55:57,450 --> 01:56:02,250
Like there's certain college professors
when they get tenure become preposterous

1955
01:56:02,251 --> 01:56:06,240
human beings. And one of the reasons
is that they can't get fired.

1956
01:56:06,450 --> 01:56:11,450
They have this really ridiculous power
and people tend when they have power to

1957
01:56:11,731 --> 01:56:14,760
explore the limits of it. It's
just, it's almost an inherent, yeah.

1958
01:56:15,210 --> 01:56:19,110
I've been listening to the last and it
was like maybe the fourth or fifth time

1959
01:56:19,140 --> 01:56:23,280
in just the last year that I've listened
to this Dan Carlin series on the

1960
01:56:23,281 --> 01:56:26,850
Mongols. It's a wrath of the
cons that's on hardcore history.

1961
01:56:26,851 --> 01:56:30,060
This podcast is to change cause
I'm fascinated. It's the greatest.

1962
01:56:30,120 --> 01:56:33,300
If Dan Carlin's podcasts is the
greatest podcast the world's ever known,

1963
01:56:33,301 --> 01:56:37,370
it shouldn't be called a podcast cause
it's too good. It's, it's, it's this,

1964
01:56:37,371 --> 01:56:42,371
it's essentially a dramatic version of
like history and not just the Margoles

1965
01:56:42,630 --> 01:56:46,050
but everything from like world war
one to do. There's so much shit to,

1966
01:56:46,051 --> 01:56:48,840
this guy covers in such as
incredible dramatic fashion.

1967
01:56:48,841 --> 01:56:52,710
But as I'm listening to these tales
of carnage and conquest and all,

1968
01:56:52,890 --> 01:56:57,520
and I'm wondering like, what the fuck
is it that compels people to, to,

1969
01:56:57,640 --> 01:56:59,070
to operate in this way?

1970
01:56:59,220 --> 01:57:03,420
Like what is it about someone who
gets in power and abuses that power,

1971
01:57:03,421 --> 01:57:06,030
whether it's a priest or whether it's a,
you know,

1972
01:57:06,031 --> 01:57:10,990
a politician or a police officer. Great
question. What the fuck is it? Like,

1973
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:16,040
is it just something that [inaudible]
like ingrained in us to resist,

1974
01:57:16,470 --> 01:57:17,161
like to,

1975
01:57:17,161 --> 01:57:21,570
to have the strength to resist opposition
so that when the opposition isn't

1976
01:57:21,571 --> 01:57:23,280
there and you have ultimate power,

1977
01:57:23,281 --> 01:57:27,420
you spool up your power to
ultimately resist opposition again,

1978
01:57:27,630 --> 01:57:31,010
it's like you gather up your
resources when you have control. Yeah.

1979
01:57:31,290 --> 01:57:34,380
I mean it almost seems
like this weird sort of a,

1980
01:57:34,381 --> 01:57:38,730
a cyclical thing that's very
difficult to escape. Yes.

1981
01:57:39,060 --> 01:57:41,190
Very, very difficult to escape.
And I think that that's,

1982
01:57:41,460 --> 01:57:45,750
that's the one thing that troubles most
of us, most of us rational thinking.

1983
01:57:45,751 --> 01:57:48,510
People who live in urban environments
or don't have to worry about anything

1984
01:57:48,511 --> 01:57:52,050
other than like normal, petty
bullshit, they occasional crime.

1985
01:57:52,260 --> 01:57:53,820
What we're worried about is like,

1986
01:57:53,821 --> 01:57:57,270
what the fuck is going on in the Congo?

1987
01:57:57,271 --> 01:58:01,980
What the fuck is going on in Afghanistan?
What the fuck is going on in Crimea?

1988
01:58:02,250 --> 01:58:06,360
What? What? What are these, these worlds
that we don't ever want to see in,

1989
01:58:06,810 --> 01:58:10,710
in fucking Tribeca?
What are these worlds that we see?

1990
01:58:14,090 --> 01:58:17,040
Right?
We're on the right page at the right time.

1991
01:58:17,041 --> 01:58:19,650
I'm just going to give you
one anecdote of exactly that,

1992
01:58:20,550 --> 01:58:24,630
which is I believe we're
sort of the same kind of guy.

1993
01:58:24,631 --> 01:58:26,970
We grew up in the same year.
It's way different than you bitch,

1994
01:58:27,510 --> 01:58:30,000
settle down while you're away.
Tougher and stronger.

1995
01:58:30,300 --> 01:58:33,710
You're way more bold anywhere. You're
a fucking button. World Traveler.

1996
01:58:33,750 --> 01:58:37,950
I had a real and occasional I had her.
I still am going to take you to find,

1997
01:58:38,100 --> 01:58:41,260
by the way, remember one of the
last times I was on here, I like,

1998
01:58:41,261 --> 01:58:42,160
we should go to Liberia

1999
01:58:42,160 --> 01:58:46,570
to find the aids island of the
monkeys to guess what happened. Ebola.

2000
01:58:46,571 --> 01:58:50,740
So it's a good thing we
didn't go aids a bully, bully,

2001
01:58:51,340 --> 01:58:53,860
bully eats everything. Maybe
we need aid, state aid.

2002
01:58:54,040 --> 01:58:55,360
I'm really not worried about aids.

2003
01:58:55,960 --> 01:58:58,450
I'm going to tell you that I'm worried
about Ebola. I was worried about it.

2004
01:58:58,480 --> 01:59:01,200
I'm not even worried about it. Paul.
I'm worried about the flu. You know why?

2005
01:59:01,201 --> 01:59:03,820
Because I flu kills more people
than the goal every fucking year.

2006
01:59:04,060 --> 01:59:07,690
Not really number one killer before
World War One was, you know the flu.

2007
01:59:07,870 --> 01:59:09,010
You know what the number one killer,

2008
01:59:09,011 --> 01:59:13,690
almost universally the entire history
of the human race's death, malaria,

2009
01:59:14,200 --> 01:59:17,920
malaria and old hills and all
day, all day. Just all day I'm at,

2010
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:22,270
I'm at midnight of my ecological,
environmental and a whatever it is,

2011
01:59:22,750 --> 01:59:27,730
evolutionary clock. So I'm fucked.
But if I could just hold on,

2012
01:59:27,731 --> 01:59:30,160
but you brought up an
amazing point and I just,

2013
01:59:30,220 --> 01:59:33,670
because I had to deal with this
recently and it was a big t,

2014
01:59:33,671 --> 01:59:36,610
you sober up and listen to the
podcast for you make tests team.

2015
01:59:36,650 --> 01:59:41,140
It was a big epiphany for me
when I said I have a penis. No,

2016
01:59:41,680 --> 01:59:45,960
it was, I woke up one
night and uh, you know,

2017
01:59:46,110 --> 01:59:50,020
I used to sleep fucking, you
know, 12 hours later. Now I
wake up, I don't know why,

2018
01:59:50,680 --> 01:59:54,610
but I woke up and it was my daughter's
first day of school. Right. And so,

2019
01:59:54,611 --> 01:59:54,821
you know,

2020
01:59:54,821 --> 01:59:57,820
I got to take my daughter to the first
day at school and I was thinking about

2021
01:59:57,821 --> 02:00:02,140
school and I'd always been like, you
know, I went to sort of public school,

2022
02:00:02,141 --> 02:00:04,930
rough schools and I think that's
where I got to where I am.

2023
02:00:04,931 --> 02:00:08,350
Because schools just bullshitted
to curriculum everywhere you go.

2024
02:00:08,650 --> 02:00:10,120
But you learn to pecking order,

2025
02:00:10,121 --> 02:00:14,380
you learn a lot of other shit besides
the fucking one plus one equals two.

2026
02:00:14,381 --> 02:00:16,960
You learn where you are and what
you do and you learn how to fight.

2027
02:00:16,960 --> 02:00:19,870
You learn how to not fight and
do whatever you want in any case.

2028
02:00:19,871 --> 02:00:22,810
So I was thinking a lot about my daughter
going to school because she's has a

2029
02:00:22,811 --> 02:00:24,340
different life to me cause I,
you know,

2030
02:00:24,341 --> 02:00:28,810
I grew up poor and she has a different
life to me. And then I was thinking,

2031
02:00:28,870 --> 02:00:32,470
you know, my daughter now is about
to go to school for 25 fucking years.

2032
02:00:32,500 --> 02:00:36,880
You go to school for 25 years. Why?
Because you want to have a career.

2033
02:00:36,881 --> 02:00:37,481
What's the career?

2034
02:00:37,481 --> 02:00:41,920
While a career hopefully is something
that you like doing and you make some

2035
02:00:41,921 --> 02:00:45,310
money and maybe you make a difference
or at least you convinced yourself you

2036
02:00:45,311 --> 02:00:49,420
make a difference and you know you're
making enough money to maybe buy a house

2037
02:00:49,421 --> 02:00:53,260
and maybe you can retire somewhere warm
cause fucking cold makes your arthritis

2038
02:00:53,261 --> 02:00:57,570
right. He can, I'm literally
thinking about like life,
you know, cause cause you,

2039
02:00:57,571 --> 02:00:58,230
you know,

2040
02:00:58,230 --> 02:01:01,570
like I went to school and then I worked
and then you've got a career and then

2041
02:01:01,571 --> 02:01:05,200
you tried this and you did all this shit.
And I had been at war.

2042
02:01:05,230 --> 02:01:07,930
I realize I've been at war
since I was five years old.

2043
02:01:07,931 --> 02:01:11,800
I fought every kid in the school yard
and then I tried to get in the fucking

2044
02:01:11,801 --> 02:01:15,490
this and I tried to play
football and whatever the
fuck else. I was always a war.

2045
02:01:15,900 --> 02:01:18,280
I was at war with my brother.
We fought every day of our lives,

2046
02:01:19,240 --> 02:01:23,020
and then when I got out of school,
I started a company. That company,

2047
02:01:23,021 --> 02:01:27,820
I was always at war, right? All of
a sudden I woke up one day, okay.

2048
02:01:28,750 --> 02:01:32,950
I went to school, I got my career,
I got to work with my best friends.

2049
02:01:33,340 --> 02:01:36,970
I became a billionaire, right?
Doesn't happen. I got the a plus.

2050
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:41,240
I got the fucking a plus and
I'm sitting there going, okay,

2051
02:01:41,450 --> 02:01:44,930
I don't have to go to school anymore.
I don't have to work anymore.

2052
02:01:45,020 --> 02:01:49,130
I don't have anything to do anymore.
I can move to fucking my private island,

2053
02:01:49,520 --> 02:01:52,640
put my Amedeus.
We gone put the fucking pony tail,

2054
02:01:52,641 --> 02:01:56,030
but plug up the ass and ride my fucking
horse into the sunset. Just got real.

2055
02:01:56,630 --> 02:01:59,240
Now why are you getting up in the morning?

2056
02:02:00,080 --> 02:02:03,590
What do you have to fucking do? Why are
you doing it? And they'll look at you.

2057
02:02:03,970 --> 02:02:08,970
You are a fucking big star on TV or
the number of fucking voice of the MMA.

2058
02:02:09,350 --> 02:02:12,620
You're got a huge comedy career going
and you do whatever the fuck you want to

2059
02:02:12,621 --> 02:02:16,730
do. You're done. You won, you won.
You got an a plus in the game of life.

2060
02:02:16,731 --> 02:02:19,930
You got an a plus. I got an a plus. Guess
what? I don't have to do anything, right?

2061
02:02:19,931 --> 02:02:24,560
I have no more chips on my shoulder.
I have no more demons to exercise.

2062
02:02:24,770 --> 02:02:29,510
What the fuck gets me up in the
morning, right? And then I said,

2063
02:02:30,380 --> 02:02:35,030
you know what gets me up in the fucking
morning fun doing this shit with you

2064
02:02:35,240 --> 02:02:39,320
going out there and saying, hey, by
everybody you can listen to me or not.

2065
02:02:39,500 --> 02:02:44,450
But ANTARTICA is fucking melting.
And if I don't say something about that,

2066
02:02:44,451 --> 02:02:46,820
then I can't look.
My daughter in the eye when I feed her,

2067
02:02:46,821 --> 02:02:50,430
her Kraft macaroni and cheese would be
burger for conviction as good for you.

2068
02:02:51,010 --> 02:02:55,400
It isn't, shouldn't give those kids. I,

2069
02:02:55,970 --> 02:02:56,960
I most of it,

2070
02:02:57,350 --> 02:03:02,350
but I can't look my fucking
kids in the face unless I say,

2071
02:03:02,661 --> 02:03:06,560
guess what? We got to fix
Washington doesn't work. We got,

2072
02:03:06,561 --> 02:03:11,561
we have to fucking do something about
global warming or we're all foc to now me

2073
02:03:12,711 --> 02:03:16,530
and you were still going to be okay.
We'll be all right because I'm much long,

2074
02:03:16,880 --> 02:03:19,940
longer live, but our kids, and by the way,

2075
02:03:19,941 --> 02:03:23,640
and I love your kids and
you have beautiful kids and
I have beautiful kids in

2076
02:03:23,641 --> 02:03:26,930
our family. We love our kids.
I, I don't give a fuck about me.

2077
02:03:26,931 --> 02:03:27,980
I had a lot of tough on,

2078
02:03:27,981 --> 02:03:32,510
I did a lot of coke and drag it out of
booze and had a lot of sex and all that

2079
02:03:32,511 --> 02:03:35,120
shit. But you're like, guess
what? Like we, you know,

2080
02:03:35,270 --> 02:03:39,590
and so at this point you're like, I can
either ride off into the sunset and say,

2081
02:03:39,591 --> 02:03:43,700
fuck it. I'll sit on an island beach and
I'll drink fucking miss gala every day.

2082
02:03:44,030 --> 02:03:47,060
Or you can go out there and say,
no matter what,

2083
02:03:47,270 --> 02:03:48,800
I'm going to kick against the pricks.

2084
02:03:48,810 --> 02:03:51,230
I'm going to say this ain't
fucking right by the way.

2085
02:03:51,231 --> 02:03:54,350
What you're saying is bullshit.
I'm going to go talk, by the way,

2086
02:03:54,351 --> 02:03:57,290
I'm going to go interview Putin, I'm
going to interview and I'm going to say,

2087
02:03:57,291 --> 02:03:59,120
what the fuck are you doing?
And by the way,

2088
02:03:59,150 --> 02:04:00,600
guess who I'm interviewing after Puente.

2089
02:04:00,600 --> 02:04:03,950
I'm interviewing Obama and I'm going
to say what the fuck's going on? Why?

2090
02:04:04,070 --> 02:04:05,930
Because why the fuck not?

2091
02:04:06,500 --> 02:04:11,180
And that's why I always get excited
about coming on this show is because this

2092
02:04:11,181 --> 02:04:15,080
show is democracy in action. You have
millions of fucking people listening.

2093
02:04:15,290 --> 02:04:18,050
And guess what?
Unless we say something,

2094
02:04:18,380 --> 02:04:22,400
unless we wake up from our
volume and booze induced stupor,

2095
02:04:23,130 --> 02:04:27,020
nothing's going to fucking happen.
So why the fuck are you doing it?

2096
02:04:27,050 --> 02:04:30,500
That's the question you should ask
yourself from 2015 not am I going to lose

2097
02:04:30,501 --> 02:04:33,350
weight now I'm going to
read more fucking books,

2098
02:04:33,590 --> 02:04:36,620
not am I going to go wear sketchers
instead of Nike's. It should be.

2099
02:04:36,800 --> 02:04:38,040
Why the fuck do I

2100
02:04:38,040 --> 02:04:43,040
get up in the fucking morning and now
we're very lucky motherfuckers that were

2101
02:04:43,381 --> 02:04:45,480
posed economic and we can fucking say,

2102
02:04:45,660 --> 02:04:47,730
I'm going to get up in the
morning because of this.

2103
02:04:47,910 --> 02:04:51,060
I like how the 1% is relabeled
themselves post economic.

2104
02:04:52,560 --> 02:04:53,790
Well,
I'm the newest,

2105
02:04:54,360 --> 02:04:58,070
I'm the newest of the 1% and
I'm giving it all away. Cause I,

2106
02:04:58,140 --> 02:05:01,530
I'll tell you one thing. Money means a
fuck of a lot when you don't have it.

2107
02:05:01,710 --> 02:05:05,610
By my old man told me the only thing
that ever made any sense about money,

2108
02:05:05,611 --> 02:05:08,100
he said, life is like your shit
sandwich. The more bread you have,

2109
02:05:08,101 --> 02:05:12,120
the sheet you have to eat. But once
you get it, once you get that a plus,

2110
02:05:12,130 --> 02:05:14,190
she just say, fuck it. You
know what I'd like to do?

2111
02:05:14,360 --> 02:05:15,870
I would like to buy 20 million acres.

2112
02:05:15,871 --> 02:05:17,460
We'll say no one's
allowed to fuck with that.

2113
02:05:17,461 --> 02:05:20,250
You can't fucking do shit
with that fucking land.

2114
02:05:20,251 --> 02:05:24,420
I'm just gonna fucking leave it because
that's one of the only things you can do.

2115
02:05:24,870 --> 02:05:28,170
That's a pure good. Just leave
the land. Don't fucking mine it.

2116
02:05:28,500 --> 02:05:32,100
Don't fucking pison and don't shit in it.
Don't put Joe's tuna,

2117
02:05:32,101 --> 02:05:34,110
bards and Tequila boom,
boom room in there.

2118
02:05:34,290 --> 02:05:36,980
Just leave it fucking gorgeous
because fucking that's,

2119
02:05:37,110 --> 02:05:39,480
that's that's God had to me is nature.

2120
02:05:39,550 --> 02:05:44,110
Well I think one of the things that's
changing in our world is that more people

2121
02:05:44,111 --> 02:05:46,420
have uh,
the ability to communicate.

2122
02:05:46,730 --> 02:05:50,710
They might not be able to communicate
on the scale that is like a podcast like

2123
02:05:50,711 --> 02:05:55,210
this, but they have the ability to express
themselves to us. And maybe, you know,

2124
02:05:55,240 --> 02:05:57,790
if you are on Twitter or Facebook or you,
you,

2125
02:05:58,240 --> 02:06:00,880
you ran into him in some
form of social media,

2126
02:06:00,910 --> 02:06:03,490
you might read what they said
and take it into account.

2127
02:06:03,610 --> 02:06:07,840
So something about them trying to express
themselves has some sort of a meaning.

2128
02:06:08,020 --> 02:06:13,020
One of the things that has the most
impact for those people is someone who can

2129
02:06:13,241 --> 02:06:15,970
reach millions of people who
represents their points of view.

2130
02:06:16,270 --> 02:06:21,160
Because most of our field guys,
I'm, that's not happening.
Rogue and Brian, Stan,

2131
02:06:21,190 --> 02:06:24,430
he was on my podcast this week. He can,
when I can, I don't have skeletons.

2132
02:06:24,431 --> 02:06:26,380
I got graveyards.
This guy.

2133
02:06:26,830 --> 02:06:31,830
I'm pretty sure if you have graveyard
concentration camps were all good but

2134
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:39,000
all be your office or your breath or
your press secretary to warm up for my

2135
02:06:39,731 --> 02:06:41,230
workout.
I'm not into one.

2136
02:06:42,060 --> 02:06:44,880
I would say to everybody out there,

2137
02:06:44,881 --> 02:06:47,340
the Joe Rogan would be the
greatest political candidates.

2138
02:06:47,380 --> 02:06:50,140
No, no. It'd be terrible because
I have other shit I want to do.

2139
02:06:50,141 --> 02:06:52,480
I'm not going to stop commentating
for the UFC. I love that.

2140
02:06:52,481 --> 02:06:54,070
I'm not going to stop doing standup.
I love that.

2141
02:06:54,071 --> 02:06:55,360
I'm not going to stop podcasting.

2142
02:06:55,361 --> 02:06:58,600
I'm not going to stop hanging out with
my kids and taking care of my family.

2143
02:06:58,601 --> 02:07:03,430
So where's my time? Well that's
true. It doesn't exist but,

2144
02:07:03,880 --> 02:07:07,420
but this is just, it's not just as
good as being a president, but it's,

2145
02:07:07,460 --> 02:07:12,130
it's far as like what I can do with who
I am and what personality I've sort of

2146
02:07:12,580 --> 02:07:15,190
developed along this path of life.

2147
02:07:15,670 --> 02:07:19,810
If I wasn't me and I saw me and I said,
hey man,

2148
02:07:19,811 --> 02:07:21,730
you should talk about this shit
cause this is kind of weird.

2149
02:07:21,850 --> 02:07:24,790
This is kind of fucked up.
My obligation is to do that.

2150
02:07:24,791 --> 02:07:28,390
And your obligation that as well.
And I think that's what you're saying.

2151
02:07:29,170 --> 02:07:32,920
I used to play pool like it did to
a degenerate level. High fashion.

2152
02:07:33,010 --> 02:07:36,320
Well I never played professional but
I played some [inaudible] whacked out.

2153
02:07:36,340 --> 02:07:37,480
You were good.
You were good.

2154
02:07:37,540 --> 02:07:40,060
I wasn't good to compare it to people
that were good. But my point being,

2155
02:07:40,390 --> 02:07:42,850
I know you were a good
cause you played with it.

2156
02:07:43,180 --> 02:07:45,640
The people that are really good at pool,

2157
02:07:45,700 --> 02:07:49,790
almost universally they're gamblers
almost universally all I'm a,

2158
02:07:49,960 --> 02:07:53,860
there's a few guys in Europe but the
American players like almost all of them,

2159
02:07:53,861 --> 02:07:57,190
what they call match up and
the guys who are the best,

2160
02:07:57,220 --> 02:08:02,220
they always look at pool as what
the ultimate thing is winning.

2161
02:08:03,100 --> 02:08:07,450
And what money is is just fun.
Coupons. Yeah, just pull coupons.

2162
02:08:07,451 --> 02:08:10,350
You pass those back and forth. You don't
worry about the money. You're trying.

2163
02:08:10,351 --> 02:08:11,560
I'm not trying to accumulate money.

2164
02:08:11,740 --> 02:08:13,720
Well you're trying to do
is when the big score,

2165
02:08:14,430 --> 02:08:16,710
I worried about money a lot cause I,

2166
02:08:16,770 --> 02:08:20,280
I left home at 14 and I was broke
and I worried about the top 14,

2167
02:08:20,340 --> 02:08:25,340
14 and I worried about when
I left home I was a bad guy.

2168
02:08:25,410 --> 02:08:30,330
How bad? Fairly medium. No medium
guy. I was medium bad because I,

2169
02:08:30,331 --> 02:08:35,040
you can't be that bad in Ottawa,
Canada, but I was as bad as it gets. Um,

2170
02:08:35,730 --> 02:08:37,910
but I got to say like,
you know,

2171
02:08:37,950 --> 02:08:41,160
money consumed me for a long time.

2172
02:08:41,220 --> 02:08:44,790
A M B I had a big old chip on my shoulder.

2173
02:08:44,880 --> 02:08:46,320
I would say what?

2174
02:08:46,590 --> 02:08:51,590
What fueled me for 75% of my life was
spite because I would say I'm going to

2175
02:08:53,401 --> 02:08:55,770
fucking do this. And they'd
rolled her eyes and say, Shane,

2176
02:08:55,771 --> 02:08:57,990
you're a fucking arse hole
Shane your bullshit or whatever.

2177
02:08:58,470 --> 02:08:59,650
And like just recently I'm,

2178
02:08:59,690 --> 02:09:02,280
when I'm going to launch a news network
and they're like, oh fuck Shane,

2179
02:09:02,281 --> 02:09:06,750
you piece of shit. Fuck you.
Same family. No Mom, my family,

2180
02:09:06,840 --> 02:09:10,430
your family. My family is awesome.
I haven't my family. No, no,

2181
02:09:10,470 --> 02:09:13,450
I'm just saying people, people on
the world compete it a, sorry, sorry.

2182
02:09:13,840 --> 02:09:15,840
But you let family's house
when you were 14 yeah,

2183
02:09:15,841 --> 02:09:19,320
but not because they were mean or
shitty cause it was crazy. Yeah.

2184
02:09:19,321 --> 02:09:23,110
I was a old 14 yeah. But I
was like, I was like, Nah.

2185
02:09:23,140 --> 02:09:27,650
It was the same height I am now. I looked
old. I was working as a bartender. I was,

2186
02:09:27,920 --> 02:09:30,990
I was screwing chicks so older than me.
I was getting drunk.

2187
02:09:31,110 --> 02:09:35,940
You were a bartender at 1414 well this
is Canada to back in the fucking day when

2188
02:09:35,941 --> 02:09:40,860
it was like, well, right. Who
gives a fuck? And it was, I
was a punk kid by the way.

2189
02:09:41,400 --> 02:09:46,400
I had a great time bartending at
14 and sling and coke and stuff.

2190
02:09:46,531 --> 02:09:51,450
But the thing is, is like, whoa, whoa,
you slump coke at 14 yeah. What? When,

2191
02:09:51,800 --> 02:09:53,760
but when, don't use slang. Coca 14

2192
02:09:55,330 --> 02:09:57,580
no, funny that is, you're like, yeah,

2193
02:09:57,940 --> 02:09:58,600
well I learned,

2194
02:09:58,600 --> 02:10:02,320
I'm all my business acumen being a
drug dealer because it's pretty fucking

2195
02:10:02,321 --> 02:10:02,621
simple.

2196
02:10:02,621 --> 02:10:05,650
You have to make a margin and you have
to do this and you have to mitigate risk

2197
02:10:05,651 --> 02:10:09,220
and all this stuff. And then it went
to eastern Europe and I sold money,

2198
02:10:09,221 --> 02:10:12,760
bought and sold money because you can
make money, a lot of money on arbitrage.

2199
02:10:13,360 --> 02:10:15,190
Right?
So the thing is is

2200
02:10:17,110 --> 02:10:21,280
money was outsized for me for a long time.

2201
02:10:21,880 --> 02:10:24,780
It was just, it was, it was, it
was a monkey on my back. And,

2202
02:10:25,300 --> 02:10:27,370
and success was based on money.
Whenever,

2203
02:10:27,880 --> 02:10:31,570
now the most arrogant fucking
thing in the world you can say is,

2204
02:10:31,571 --> 02:10:33,890
I don't give a fuck about money.
Right? Because guess what?

2205
02:10:34,100 --> 02:10:37,310
Everybody gives a fuck about
money because that's how you eat.

2206
02:10:38,120 --> 02:10:41,630
But the one thing, and it was Spike
Jones, actually, we, when we go away,

2207
02:10:41,631 --> 02:10:44,390
every once in a while we go to the top
of the mountain and we fucking talk about

2208
02:10:44,391 --> 02:10:46,670
shit and I, and, and he was like,

2209
02:10:46,671 --> 02:10:50,300
you're too concerned about money because
I am literally a poor guy who was

2210
02:10:50,301 --> 02:10:53,270
concerned about money and he's literally
a guy who never give a fuck about money.

2211
02:10:53,270 --> 02:10:57,140
And that's why he's more successful than I
am. Wait, wait, Whoa, whoa. Just say guys,

2212
02:10:57,141 --> 02:10:59,810
more successful than you.
After you said you're a billionaire,

2213
02:11:00,310 --> 02:11:02,560
let me turn this up. But
no, no, but hold on buddy.

2214
02:11:02,720 --> 02:11:06,590
Richard and a billionaire can go
fuck himself, but I'm going to tell,

2215
02:11:06,770 --> 02:11:08,330
I'm going to tell you something
about being a billion,

2216
02:11:08,720 --> 02:11:12,230
a billion or it doesn't mean anything
because guess why? Well, why? Well,

2217
02:11:12,231 --> 02:11:14,480
I'm going to tell you I'm going to,
that's a budget horseshoe, but hold on.

2218
02:11:14,481 --> 02:11:16,460
I'll tell you why. Because I'm
going to give it all. Well,

2219
02:11:16,461 --> 02:11:19,250
I'm not going to give it all away and
we're going to buy a bunch of land because

2220
02:11:19,251 --> 02:11:22,060
I believe in nature. I love seeing
people compete for it. Yeah.

2221
02:11:22,250 --> 02:11:26,900
And die and I'm just going to leave it.
That's going to be my thing.

2222
02:11:27,200 --> 02:11:30,230
But what I will say is,
it's true, it's true.

2223
02:11:30,260 --> 02:11:33,710
Money won't buy you happiness,
but guess what?

2224
02:11:33,950 --> 02:11:37,910
Your family not having to worry about
where the next rent checks coming from.

2225
02:11:38,210 --> 02:11:41,690
You know, being able to fucking feed your
kids, all that shit. That is important.

2226
02:11:42,080 --> 02:11:46,940
Incredibly important. It takes the stress
away, but more importantly it goes, okay,

2227
02:11:46,941 --> 02:11:49,550
now take all that shit
out of the equation.

2228
02:11:49,760 --> 02:11:53,860
What the fuck are you going to do
today, right, with everything you know,

2229
02:11:53,970 --> 02:11:56,750
look at you. You're a powerful guy.
You got all these people listen to you.

2230
02:11:57,110 --> 02:11:59,720
What are you going to do? Guess
what? Joe Rogan could say, fuck you.

2231
02:11:59,721 --> 02:12:02,290
I'm going to drive my fucking car.
I'm going to go bow hunting.

2232
02:12:02,310 --> 02:12:05,900
I'm going to fucking go to uh,
[inaudible] and fucking lie on the beach.

2233
02:12:06,020 --> 02:12:06,571
What are you doing?

2234
02:12:06,571 --> 02:12:09,110
And you're fucking sitting here with
me doing the back to back podcast,

2235
02:12:09,111 --> 02:12:12,380
talking about shit, challenging people,
putting information to people's minds.

2236
02:12:12,830 --> 02:12:17,000
I don't have to ever work again. Why
am I sitting here on the fucking Rogan?

2237
02:12:17,030 --> 02:12:20,300
But I could be doing USA today.
I can be doing fucking 60 minutes.

2238
02:12:20,480 --> 02:12:22,160
Why am I doing the Rogan podcast?

2239
02:12:22,430 --> 02:12:26,240
Because this Anderson Cooper
hit on you because I heard,

2240
02:12:26,241 --> 02:12:29,870
because this is important and we always
get to this at the end of the day,

2241
02:12:29,871 --> 02:12:34,871
is there is a movement of likeminded
people who have the a plus who go,

2242
02:12:35,960 --> 02:12:39,090
I don't give a fuck about da plus.
I don't give a fuck about the money.

2243
02:12:39,091 --> 02:12:40,900
I don't give a shit about you are fucking,

2244
02:12:40,901 --> 02:12:44,550
you are fucking biggest star and
I'm forget the network, but come on.

2245
02:12:45,110 --> 02:12:47,940
What's the net where ABC, CBS, NBC

2246
02:12:50,970 --> 02:12:54,410
thinking about is what are you doing now?
You're literally hold on.

2247
02:12:54,411 --> 02:12:58,400
You're literally spending your own
fucking money to have shit heads like me.

2248
02:12:58,401 --> 02:13:02,570
Come on here and talk to people. I know
every time we get drunk, which I am now,

2249
02:13:02,810 --> 02:13:07,130
I get all boozed up and says, but this is
democracy in action. This is important.

2250
02:13:07,131 --> 02:13:11,570
And by the way, you took your a plus and
said, I'm going to do my own thing, bitch.

2251
02:13:11,750 --> 02:13:14,450
I took my a plus and said, I'm
going to do my own thing. Bitch.

2252
02:13:14,750 --> 02:13:18,500
We're not Brad Pitt or George Clooney
accepting our Golden Globe lifetime

2253
02:13:18,501 --> 02:13:21,890
achievement award, but guess what?
Millions of people are saying, hey,

2254
02:13:21,950 --> 02:13:24,680
how the fuck can we change the shift
that you're talking about on the rogue

2255
02:13:24,681 --> 02:13:27,650
insurance is the thing that people
like least about us when we're drunk,

2256
02:13:27,860 --> 02:13:31,590
we just compliment each other.
They're like, hey, Joe Rogan.

2257
02:13:32,100 --> 02:13:35,740
Joe Rogan sucks, but I've got
to say, can you try and go?

2258
02:13:36,450 --> 02:13:40,650
I've got to say, if Joe Rogan and I don't
get along, then the world will land.

2259
02:13:41,210 --> 02:13:45,050
No, we'll be fine. We'll all
be fine. As I've gotten older,

2260
02:13:45,051 --> 02:13:49,310
one of the things that I've really come
to grips with is in this really strange

2261
02:13:49,311 --> 02:13:53,810
way is that we, for this brief
glimpse that were awakened alive,

2262
02:13:54,080 --> 02:13:59,080
we're really just a blip in this
infinite number of blips and w what I,

2263
02:14:02,330 --> 02:14:04,460
everybody worries about
their own finite nature.

2264
02:14:04,490 --> 02:14:08,630
It's one of the things that troubles all
of us and I'm, I'm one of those people.

2265
02:14:08,631 --> 02:14:11,180
It's just impossible to avoid.
I think anybody that doesn't,

2266
02:14:11,330 --> 02:14:13,220
it's not troubled by
the idea that you know,

2267
02:14:13,221 --> 02:14:17,180
you only have a certain amount of days
and hours and minutes on this earth

2268
02:14:17,330 --> 02:14:21,820
before. Eventually this vehicle shuts
down and stops working. Like what?

2269
02:14:22,170 --> 02:14:25,040
What? What, what are the things
that are important to you,

2270
02:14:25,041 --> 02:14:26,560
why you're here and what's important you,

2271
02:14:26,561 --> 02:14:30,350
why are you here is trying to spread
what I would call harmony would,

2272
02:14:30,351 --> 02:14:32,260
I would try to call this,

2273
02:14:32,270 --> 02:14:35,630
this community communion with each other.

2274
02:14:35,630 --> 02:14:39,770
The ability to develop really honest,

2275
02:14:39,830 --> 02:14:42,920
friendly relationships and I
think a lot of what we have,

2276
02:14:43,520 --> 02:14:48,350
whether it's issues with Muslims or
whether it's issues with Christians or

2277
02:14:48,351 --> 02:14:49,184
whether it is,

2278
02:14:49,190 --> 02:14:52,580
I think a lot of the issues that we
have across the board with human beings,

2279
02:14:52,581 --> 02:14:55,700
with various ideologies is
a lack of communication,

2280
02:14:55,701 --> 02:14:59,750
a lack of understanding that at the end
of the day we're like each other more

2281
02:14:59,751 --> 02:15:03,500
than we're different and what separates
us and what what you're talking about.

2282
02:15:03,501 --> 02:15:07,730
And the good thing about having financial
independence is that once you have

2283
02:15:07,731 --> 02:15:08,840
financial independence,

2284
02:15:09,740 --> 02:15:13,430
it releases you in a way
that's indescribable.

2285
02:15:13,431 --> 02:15:18,290
The people that are caught up in the,
the constant, very common web of,

2286
02:15:18,380 --> 02:15:22,520
of, of existence. It's
fired existence. It's hard.

2287
02:15:22,580 --> 02:15:24,540
I had a developments yard when I was,

2288
02:15:24,560 --> 02:15:28,850
I was 26 years old and I got a development
deal to come to California and do

2289
02:15:28,851 --> 02:15:31,270
this television show. And
when I, when I got it,

2290
02:15:31,271 --> 02:15:36,050
I got to check and it was a flick for
like $150,000 or something along those

2291
02:15:36,051 --> 02:15:39,820
lines. And immediately it was
like the whole world just,

2292
02:15:40,650 --> 02:15:43,100
just relaxed. Like I knew, you know,

2293
02:15:43,101 --> 02:15:44,930
my rent was like 600 bucks
or something like that.

2294
02:15:44,931 --> 02:15:49,220
I knew I could pay my rent now.
I knew I could eat now. I knew,

2295
02:15:49,460 --> 02:15:53,900
I knew I made 500 bucks in the
average week doing stand up.

2296
02:15:53,930 --> 02:15:57,710
I knew I could eat, I could pay my rent,
I could eat. And it was like this. Whoa.

2297
02:15:57,711 --> 02:16:00,860
And I remember sitting in my shitty
apartment in new Rochelle, New York,

2298
02:16:01,970 --> 02:16:04,940
and I had this weird epiphany when
that happened. I was like, Whoa,

2299
02:16:05,150 --> 02:16:07,850
this is like the biggest relief
I've ever had in my life.

2300
02:16:08,030 --> 02:16:12,950
Not I'm not rich by anybody's standards,
but all of a sudden now I'm a,

2301
02:16:12,951 --> 02:16:17,730
I'm slightly ahead of the run. And
again, I can stop and I can really,

2302
02:16:17,731 --> 02:16:20,250
I could look at the struggle
behind me and I'm like, oh,

2303
02:16:20,270 --> 02:16:24,170
we're caught up and we're caught
up in the momentum of debt.

2304
02:16:24,290 --> 02:16:26,420
We're caught up in the momentum of stress.

2305
02:16:26,600 --> 02:16:30,700
We're caught up in the momentum of having
to every this and that and every week

2306
02:16:30,730 --> 02:16:32,740
worry about did they
gonna shut my lights out,

2307
02:16:32,741 --> 02:16:37,690
all my cable bill fucking writing checks
and all that stupid shit that people do

2308
02:16:37,691 --> 02:16:40,450
all day. And as soon as you
can step away from that,

2309
02:16:40,600 --> 02:16:43,830
then you start to look at your life
and going like, what is my life like?

2310
02:16:43,840 --> 02:16:48,840
This just constant worry about this
impending tide of bills and pushing them

2311
02:16:50,021 --> 02:16:50,510
back.

2312
02:16:50,510 --> 02:16:52,280
Yes.
So

2313
02:16:52,880 --> 02:16:53,541
the one thing,

2314
02:16:53,541 --> 02:16:57,080
the responsibility that I think a person
like you has or a person like I have,

2315
02:16:57,560 --> 02:17:02,560
is that once you are slightly ahead of
that wave to let people know what it's

2316
02:17:02,781 --> 02:17:06,230
like, let people know what's going
on up here. And also let people know,

2317
02:17:06,231 --> 02:17:09,410
like you're being misled. This
doesn't last forever. The a sled,

2318
02:17:09,411 --> 02:17:12,990
that the whole thing, knowing your,
because we're all being misled.

2319
02:17:13,110 --> 02:17:15,160
You're saying what you're
saying is a hundred

2320
02:17:15,910 --> 02:17:20,910
I was so caught up in bills and money
and buy him shit and not buying shit and

2321
02:17:22,001 --> 02:17:25,340
being broke for so long that I got a,

2322
02:17:25,341 --> 02:17:29,800
I got consumed about cash and you're
exactly right when you have this.

2323
02:17:29,830 --> 02:17:32,740
It could be a hundred grand, it could be
whatever. It could be. Vegas could be,

2324
02:17:32,760 --> 02:17:36,160
I doesn't matter what it is.
But you get it and then you go,

2325
02:17:36,550 --> 02:17:41,550
oh all that time I spent worrying about
it all that time I was freaked out all

2326
02:17:41,621 --> 02:17:44,860
that time.
Like it's just a construct.

2327
02:17:44,890 --> 02:17:46,900
We make it up it money.

2328
02:17:46,901 --> 02:17:51,901
Is it just a bunch of fucking computer
fucking blips on the screen and then when

2329
02:17:51,971 --> 02:17:56,570
you get it you realize, and
this is Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye.

2330
02:17:56,780 --> 02:17:59,740
Aye. Aye. I know how
arrogant it is to say,

2331
02:17:59,741 --> 02:18:04,741
but at the same time you're like fuck
like all that time cause I'm stupid.

2332
02:18:07,360 --> 02:18:10,660
All that time I was
trying to chase the money.

2333
02:18:11,320 --> 02:18:15,310
I should have been trying
to chase something else. I
don't think I'll tell you,

2334
02:18:15,320 --> 02:18:16,780
but hold on.
I'll tell you what I mean,

2335
02:18:17,530 --> 02:18:22,000
because you know Spike Jones,
who I love more than anything,

2336
02:18:22,760 --> 02:18:23,593
you know,

2337
02:18:23,830 --> 02:18:28,360
he made adaptation being John
Malcovich every fucking award,

2338
02:18:28,361 --> 02:18:33,280
winning music, video, every award,
winning fucking commodity. Everyone most,

2339
02:18:33,730 --> 02:18:37,750
most and Eddie Kansas flow was I doing,

2340
02:18:37,751 --> 02:18:39,860
I was trying to make money.
We actually want to,

2341
02:18:39,870 --> 02:18:41,950
I'm one of our go to the mountain things.

2342
02:18:41,951 --> 02:18:44,980
It was like take money out of the
equation. What would you be doing?

2343
02:18:44,981 --> 02:18:48,430
And you know what I said I'd be doing
news cause that's the only shit that I

2344
02:18:48,431 --> 02:18:50,770
really like doing anymore.
Guess what I did after that?

2345
02:18:50,950 --> 02:18:54,580
I started news channel and news is stupid.

2346
02:18:54,970 --> 02:18:57,550
He can't make money. You can't
do thing. It's not gonna work.

2347
02:18:57,551 --> 02:18:58,900
You can't start a new news channel.

2348
02:18:59,080 --> 02:19:02,110
We're the fastest growing news
channel in the fucking world, Joe.

2349
02:19:02,480 --> 02:19:05,410
Yeah, but why? Why does everybody
say you can't make money in the news?

2350
02:19:05,640 --> 02:19:09,870
Cause everyone's dumb. But everyone
will tell you, you can't do something.

2351
02:19:09,871 --> 02:19:11,280
We've talked about this before.

2352
02:19:11,550 --> 02:19:13,800
Everyone will tell you you can't
do something to tell you do it.

2353
02:19:13,801 --> 02:19:16,220
And then they'll say, I always knew
you could do it. But the thing is,

2354
02:19:16,221 --> 02:19:18,900
is because it's difficult to do.
We have,

2355
02:19:19,020 --> 02:19:23,700
we're bigger than NBC and CBS
News, uh, combined on our online,

2356
02:19:23,860 --> 02:19:24,693
uh,

2357
02:19:25,020 --> 02:19:28,970
viewership or the largest and
growing news agency in the world.

2358
02:19:29,180 --> 02:19:32,870
Everyone told me I would fail.
Every single person without fail,

2359
02:19:32,930 --> 02:19:34,910
without exception,
told me I would fail.

2360
02:19:35,240 --> 02:19:38,540
The reason why we didn't is because
everyone's doing such a shitty job were

2361
02:19:38,541 --> 02:19:41,240
telling us that the images, but I
will say this about spike. He said,

2362
02:19:41,510 --> 02:19:45,050
take money out of the equation. What
would you do? Assign going to do news.

2363
02:19:45,320 --> 02:19:47,390
He goes, if that's what's gonna
get you up in the morning,

2364
02:19:47,400 --> 02:19:49,730
go to fucking news and tell
everyone else would go to hell,

2365
02:19:50,120 --> 02:19:51,140
which is what I've been doing,

2366
02:19:51,290 --> 02:19:54,200
which is why we've been getting a little
bit of trouble because now it was like,

2367
02:19:54,201 --> 02:19:57,260
I like vice news and I don't like the
other vice anymore. But there you go.

2368
02:19:57,510 --> 02:19:59,700
People like vice news where
they don't like the other vice.

2369
02:19:59,760 --> 02:20:03,280
Well because vice when we came up
was like Poopoo Caca in the book.

2370
02:20:03,281 --> 02:20:07,800
Crazy vice provides, you know, and now
the robot naked, that kind of shit. Yeah.

2371
02:20:07,870 --> 02:20:11,980
But now news became so big overnight,

2372
02:20:12,010 --> 02:20:15,410
vice news and vice are now fighting
each other for being how big they are.

2373
02:20:15,970 --> 02:20:17,950
And so now know like people are like,

2374
02:20:17,951 --> 02:20:20,080
I don't want to see people
khaki in the bump moms,

2375
02:20:20,081 --> 02:20:22,630
or I don't want to see your music shit
or your travel shit. And I'm like,

2376
02:20:22,840 --> 02:20:25,720
well then just turn into vice news.
Don't turn and do the other shit.

2377
02:20:26,320 --> 02:20:30,400
But the fact is this news
became so fucking big that
it's now coloring the rest

2378
02:20:30,401 --> 02:20:34,900
of the brand because the rest of the
brand needs to be used to be everything.

2379
02:20:35,350 --> 02:20:39,820
And now everybody just wants fucking
news. Which by the way, I love news,

2380
02:20:39,821 --> 02:20:41,410
but I still like all the other shit too.

2381
02:20:41,500 --> 02:20:44,020
You know the problem is it's not
even everybody that's complaining.

2382
02:20:44,050 --> 02:20:46,270
That's not really the problem.
The problem is access.

2383
02:20:46,300 --> 02:20:50,950
The problem is you shouldn't have 300
million in America plus worldwide have

2384
02:20:50,951 --> 02:20:55,951
access to just throw Twitter comments
up and Facebook comments and youtube

2385
02:20:55,961 --> 02:20:59,320
comments because I'll come, even
though it's not bad, it's not bad,

2386
02:20:59,500 --> 02:21:03,610
but it's overwhelming in the sense that
it's very, very difficult to manage.

2387
02:21:04,050 --> 02:21:06,130
It's almost impossible
to manage those numbers.

2388
02:21:06,400 --> 02:21:09,530
So you're going to get people
that complain. Some of them was,

2389
02:21:09,730 --> 02:21:12,310
some of their complaints are legitimate
and some of their complaints are just to

2390
02:21:12,311 --> 02:21:15,160
get your attention and the best way to
get your attention to tell you you're

2391
02:21:15,161 --> 02:21:19,240
shitting the bed. You're
fucking up. You're doing badly.

2392
02:21:19,330 --> 02:21:21,970
You're disappointing them.
It's not as good as the old device.

2393
02:21:21,971 --> 02:21:25,300
The old vice was better. I'll tell
you two things about that and the,

2394
02:21:25,301 --> 02:21:30,100
and that's exactly right. No, but
I'll tell you two things about that.

2395
02:21:30,130 --> 02:21:32,770
I'll get a hundred things and
you're changing the world.

2396
02:21:32,800 --> 02:21:33,840
You're changing newsroom.

2397
02:21:34,330 --> 02:21:37,720
And one thing saying you fucking
cock sucking cock sucker,

2398
02:21:37,930 --> 02:21:42,310
all fucking meet you at 59th and
seventh I'll kick your ass. So A,

2399
02:21:42,790 --> 02:21:44,890
B,
and this hits on.

2400
02:21:45,400 --> 02:21:47,190
All right,
well I dunno about you,

2401
02:21:47,191 --> 02:21:51,660
but about me and my life is that
you sit there and you say, you know,

2402
02:21:54,670 --> 02:21:58,450
I, I started, I had a small
company before and, and,

2403
02:21:58,480 --> 02:22:01,360
and it was 10 people in a
room and you're like, Joe,

2404
02:22:01,361 --> 02:22:05,220
or you got the fucking photo and
fucking Ted. Do you have the thing?

2405
02:22:05,221 --> 02:22:10,221
And fucking Rosalia and now we're doing
something on the order of 14,000 posts

2406
02:22:11,881 --> 02:22:14,310
today. And everyone's like, shame,

2407
02:22:14,311 --> 02:22:18,630
did you fucking see what fucking Vice
Bulgaria put up in that Goddamn bullshit?

2408
02:22:18,631 --> 02:22:22,050
And Germany just said that, this and
that and whatever else. And you're like,

2409
02:22:22,410 --> 02:22:23,101
I'm sorry,

2410
02:22:23,101 --> 02:22:28,101
but I'm lucky if I see posts a day and
we do 14,000 and that's the problem with

2411
02:22:29,581 --> 02:22:33,390
running something is that
you go when it was just me,

2412
02:22:34,080 --> 02:22:36,720
it's easy when it becomes,

2413
02:22:36,840 --> 02:22:39,990
I don't know how many people even
have 4,000 employees, some shit.

2414
02:22:40,320 --> 02:22:44,070
You're like doing 14,000 posts.
It sucks.

2415
02:22:44,100 --> 02:22:47,820
And I've got to say like when it,
when it is just you,

2416
02:22:48,030 --> 02:22:52,680
it's you and, but then, then
it's not advice then it's
not a thing. It's just me.

2417
02:22:53,250 --> 02:22:53,820
And,

2418
02:22:53,820 --> 02:22:58,820
and you know what I'm trying to do now
or what vice is trying to do now is to

2419
02:23:00,301 --> 02:23:04,350
have much more of a cohesive point
of view. And, and ironically,

2420
02:23:04,351 --> 02:23:08,190
how we're going to do that is we're
buying TV networks around the world.

2421
02:23:08,760 --> 02:23:10,810
We're going to make TV shows with them.

2422
02:23:10,830 --> 02:23:15,370
We then push up for the first time
ever day and date with, with uh,

2423
02:23:15,371 --> 02:23:16,650
an online and mobile.

2424
02:23:16,651 --> 02:23:21,130
No one's ever done it before and we
believe we'll have the largest uh, uh,

2425
02:23:21,580 --> 02:23:25,800
audience in the world online,
collectively online, mobile and TV.

2426
02:23:26,160 --> 02:23:30,100
And then the question is,
okay, great, what are you going
to put in there? What you,

2427
02:23:30,450 --> 02:23:33,420
we don't want to put it in shit just
between the ads. We're like, okay,

2428
02:23:33,960 --> 02:23:38,270
who wants like all over the people that
the spikes and the harmonies and the use

2429
02:23:38,271 --> 02:23:39,104
and the whoever else.

2430
02:23:39,450 --> 02:23:44,280
Now we're saying like we can put whatever
the fuck we want out to the largest

2431
02:23:44,281 --> 02:23:45,150
audience in the world.

2432
02:23:45,510 --> 02:23:49,650
We just don't want to put shit out there
because why the fuck are we getting out

2433
02:23:49,651 --> 02:23:54,651
of bed in the morning and that is going
to be our 2015 and that is why I believe

2434
02:23:54,841 --> 02:23:59,220
I'm positive because I'm going to
give it a shot. I might fuck up,

2435
02:23:59,460 --> 02:24:01,110
I might not do a good job,

2436
02:24:01,440 --> 02:24:03,960
but at least I'm going to have that
shot and we're going to go out.

2437
02:24:03,961 --> 02:24:05,730
We're going to try to do
something that doesn't suck.

2438
02:24:05,960 --> 02:24:06,081
Well,

2439
02:24:06,081 --> 02:24:09,500
there's a bunch of people that will
complain about anybody in any position of

2440
02:24:09,501 --> 02:24:12,890
power that is either above them
or has more influence in them.

2441
02:24:13,160 --> 02:24:17,820
But if there's a person that you, you
would be like, oh, that guy got it.

2442
02:24:19,290 --> 02:24:20,720
It was a person that would be,

2443
02:24:20,721 --> 02:24:24,620
I would be relaxed in a position to
disseminate information. It'll be you.

2444
02:24:24,740 --> 02:24:25,191
And again,

2445
02:24:25,191 --> 02:24:28,970
this is more of what most people hate
about the show is us sucking each other's

2446
02:24:28,971 --> 02:24:32,030
dicks. But you're a,
you're a genuine gangster.

2447
02:24:32,060 --> 02:24:35,540
I know you do all this crazy shit even
though you have money and you can do

2448
02:24:35,541 --> 02:24:39,050
whatever you want. You don't cow town and
you don't suck up to the corporations.

2449
02:24:39,320 --> 02:24:42,590
And it's weird as the
position that you're in is,

2450
02:24:42,890 --> 02:24:46,970
I wouldn't want anybody else doing it
other than neo because most people would

2451
02:24:47,300 --> 02:24:48,140
play it safe.

2452
02:24:48,470 --> 02:24:52,070
I gotta say one thing.
When we announced anything big,

2453
02:24:52,071 --> 02:24:56,630
we'll announce it on Joe Rogan. Why I'd
be on hold on. Why? Cause literally,

2454
02:24:56,631 --> 02:25:01,460
and we've said it before and I would
challenge somebody to watch the directory

2455
02:25:01,461 --> 02:25:06,020
of these podcasts because we're going
to launch one of the largest TV networks

2456
02:25:06,021 --> 02:25:10,910
in the world. We'll launch it on the Joe
Rogan show. Why? Because we're the same.

2457
02:25:11,120 --> 02:25:14,990
Why the fuck would we launch it on
today's show or whatever the fuck it is or

2458
02:25:14,991 --> 02:25:19,280
who the fuck cares? And by the way, you
only live once. We work with our friends,

2459
02:25:19,281 --> 02:25:22,950
we do with our friends. And by the
way, we are the new audience. Oh I,

2460
02:25:22,990 --> 02:25:26,140
I'm one thing I'd like to save for anyone
who gives a shit because I think for a

2461
02:25:26,141 --> 02:25:30,400
hundred people who say fucking
Rogan and Shane doing stuff is good.

2462
02:25:30,720 --> 02:25:33,040
When people say you're
so self congratulatory,

2463
02:25:33,041 --> 02:25:36,670
the reason why is
because Joe's a real guy.

2464
02:25:36,810 --> 02:25:40,090
This is a real fucking dude
came fucking up. I'm a real guy.

2465
02:25:40,091 --> 02:25:42,820
We came up and half of it
is us looking around going,

2466
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:47,170
can you fucking believe this shit?
Can you believe where we are today?

2467
02:25:47,320 --> 02:25:51,190
We're sitting here having a conversation
with two mutual fucking dudes would

2468
02:25:51,191 --> 02:25:54,400
just have anyway, and millions of
people are listening to us on guests,

2469
02:25:54,401 --> 02:25:56,230
but we're going to announce the fucking,

2470
02:25:56,231 --> 02:25:59,530
the next wave of media in
the world together. Why?

2471
02:26:00,100 --> 02:26:02,410
Because we can and guess what?

2472
02:26:02,470 --> 02:26:06,820
If we don't celebrate that we're the
first fucking generation that's ever doing

2473
02:26:06,821 --> 02:26:10,120
that, then we should fuck off.
I Dunno. I'm getting weird. No,

2474
02:26:10,121 --> 02:26:11,170
you're not getting signals.

2475
02:26:11,171 --> 02:26:14,350
I'm getting fucking weird thing was
black for a second there on the screen,

2476
02:26:14,560 --> 02:26:18,250
but I look not just to be a human being.

2477
02:26:18,670 --> 02:26:22,360
The fact that you and I are having this
conversation to freakazoids who would

2478
02:26:22,361 --> 02:26:27,250
never be on anything any fucking other
way. I'm even if we get in shit for it,

2479
02:26:27,251 --> 02:26:31,780
I'm going to say it every time because
if I'm going to ever do anything in,

2480
02:26:31,781 --> 02:26:33,970
announce anything I'm going to
do on the rogue and show why.

2481
02:26:33,971 --> 02:26:37,480
Cause Joe Rogan is the fucking
man and because guess what?

2482
02:26:37,750 --> 02:26:39,510
I love him and that's all the fuck up

2483
02:26:39,800 --> 02:26:44,130
each other again. I try to avoid them
done. Now I'm over. Everyone can fuck off.

2484
02:26:44,131 --> 02:26:48,020
The world's about 10 it's not.
We're going to be okay, but I,

2485
02:26:48,250 --> 02:26:53,250
I see what you're saying and it sort
of aligns with what I'm saying is that

2486
02:26:54,030 --> 02:26:57,300
where we find ourselves in very unique
positions that we didn't expect to be in

2487
02:26:57,630 --> 02:27:02,370
and those positions happened
because it was just all,

2488
02:27:02,371 --> 02:27:04,690
everything along.
I don't need to do this podcast.

2489
02:27:05,130 --> 02:27:07,710
You don't need to do this podcast.
Why the fuck do you do this, Bob?

2490
02:27:07,770 --> 02:27:09,390
I want to have a conversation
like this with you.

2491
02:27:09,391 --> 02:27:11,780
If you and I had a conversation
at a restaurant, if we had a,

2492
02:27:11,800 --> 02:27:16,560
it would be 15 to 20 minutes of
your insane trips about the world.

2493
02:27:16,561 --> 02:27:20,100
We would laugh, we would tell
jokes, but there's an awareness.

2494
02:27:20,101 --> 02:27:24,960
The fact that this being broadcast that
makes us stay on point and focus on some

2495
02:27:25,140 --> 02:27:29,820
and occasionally a little dick sucking
every now and then something, but I don't,

2496
02:27:29,821 --> 02:27:31,530
I don't like that whole
Dick Sucking thing.

2497
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:35,460
Not that I don't like Dick Sucking
criticisms of us. What? Hold on.

2498
02:27:35,870 --> 02:27:38,990
I would say the hundred people saying,

2499
02:27:39,020 --> 02:27:41,960
I love the the Rogan podcast
versus the one Dick sucker.

2500
02:27:42,260 --> 02:27:47,180
The one thing I would just like to say
is what I'm doing is saying that this is

2501
02:27:47,210 --> 02:27:52,210
the first time in media history or
conversations like this can happen and I

2502
02:27:52,521 --> 02:27:53,590
don't think that's fucking

2503
02:27:53,630 --> 02:27:54,463
Dick Sucking on it.

2504
02:27:54,600 --> 02:27:57,950
I think because of a lack of censorship
and that's one of the most important

2505
02:27:57,951 --> 02:28:01,160
theories about what's going on
there. There you go. Exactly.

2506
02:28:01,161 --> 02:28:03,470
Don't don't criticize people,
Zack,

2507
02:28:03,770 --> 02:28:07,850
you think they got it wrong with their
take or their humor, their satire. No.

2508
02:28:07,851 --> 02:28:10,080
Criticize the people that are
trying to silence dissent,

2509
02:28:10,270 --> 02:28:13,100
that are trying to silence
other people's criticism.

2510
02:28:13,580 --> 02:28:15,950
Satire criticized those people.

2511
02:28:16,100 --> 02:28:18,520
Don't criticize the people
that were making cartoons or

2512
02:28:18,520 --> 02:28:21,950
we should celebrate the fact that two
motherfuckers can sit there and go out

2513
02:28:21,951 --> 02:28:22,100
there

2514
02:28:22,100 --> 02:28:25,820
and say whatever the fuck they want
and people can listen or not listen,

2515
02:28:25,821 --> 02:28:28,940
and it's never happened before. This
is very rare. Never happened before.

2516
02:28:28,941 --> 02:28:33,380
Not only that, anyone can do this.
Any guy right now who has an iPhone,

2517
02:28:33,650 --> 02:28:38,300
I mean Dunkin, I and Ari and I,
we've done many podcasts on planes.

2518
02:28:38,460 --> 02:28:40,250
When we're sitting next to each other,
well,

2519
02:28:40,251 --> 02:28:43,400
one of the one of us will hold the phone
up in between the armrest and we'll

2520
02:28:43,401 --> 02:28:45,620
just talk and we'll have
a podcast on a plane.

2521
02:28:45,621 --> 02:28:49,460
You know what the also the big
difference is hundreds of thousands,

2522
02:28:49,461 --> 02:28:54,050
if not millions of people are out there.
It used to be, maybe it's three, four,

2523
02:28:54,051 --> 02:28:56,240
five, six. This is now a movement.

2524
02:28:56,990 --> 02:29:01,700
And that's why like whenever I come here,
I have to go see fucking Rogan.

2525
02:29:01,701 --> 02:29:05,120
Why a we're friends be I love your family.

2526
02:29:05,240 --> 02:29:09,230
See like I don't want to
go talk to anybody else.

2527
02:29:09,290 --> 02:29:13,400
I don't give a fuck about anybody else.
So I'm not,

2528
02:29:13,401 --> 02:29:15,980
I'm going to stop with the Dick Sucking.
But,

2529
02:29:16,580 --> 02:29:20,810
but I would like to say this is the
celebration of free speech and I give you

2530
02:29:20,811 --> 02:29:23,060
total Kudos because you don't
have to fucking do this.

2531
02:29:23,300 --> 02:29:25,630
You don't have to pay for this
place and do all this stuff. Yeah.

2532
02:29:25,710 --> 02:29:28,880
But I'm always blown away that you do
and I'll stop there. That's very nice.

2533
02:29:28,881 --> 02:29:33,170
But I do because anyone who couldn't
but all of a sudden was given the

2534
02:29:33,171 --> 02:29:34,250
opportunity would,

2535
02:29:34,251 --> 02:29:39,140
and that's exactly the situation I find
myself in and all of it is played out

2536
02:29:39,141 --> 02:29:43,010
for all of us in a, in a very unique way
that none of us could have planned out,

2537
02:29:43,011 --> 02:29:48,011
including just the average person that
is on Facebook or Twitter that sends a

2538
02:29:48,831 --> 02:29:53,810
message that you respond to or I respond
to or anybody Dunkin or anyone responds

2539
02:29:53,811 --> 02:29:54,350
to.

2540
02:29:54,350 --> 02:29:59,000
We're in this weird error of [inaudible]
that's never existed before and we were

2541
02:29:59,001 --> 02:30:03,290
a part of it as much as anyone else and
were a part of it and that we represent

2542
02:30:03,291 --> 02:30:04,790
that even though you,
you know,

2543
02:30:04,791 --> 02:30:09,500
you do make a a lot of money
or you do pay a lot of taxes,

2544
02:30:09,501 --> 02:30:14,090
you still are just a regular person and
you will continue to do those stories

2545
02:30:14,091 --> 02:30:17,820
that you find fascinating and
in need of illumination. Yeah.

2546
02:30:17,990 --> 02:30:20,840
These all these stories, whether it's your
story and you, you went to North Korea,

2547
02:30:20,841 --> 02:30:22,220
your riches, fuck, you
didn't have to go there.

2548
02:30:22,370 --> 02:30:26,810
You did that because this was compelling
and this was also something that you

2549
02:30:26,811 --> 02:30:31,560
felt like needed to be illuminated, but
you also have to look at you and, and,

2550
02:30:31,570 --> 02:30:35,330
and say, okay, you know, where's,

2551
02:30:35,720 --> 02:30:40,040
where's everyone else doing that?
Whereas Brad Pitt or what he's doing,

2552
02:30:40,041 --> 02:30:43,310
his own thing, I mean Brad Pitt
is, he adopts a lot of calories,

2553
02:30:43,850 --> 02:30:48,850
but who's actually paying money out of
their own pocket to create a studio to

2554
02:30:49,191 --> 02:30:52,190
have dialogue. And by
the way, I will say this,

2555
02:30:52,220 --> 02:30:55,040
the only thing that really fucking
matters in this world is dialogue.

2556
02:30:55,160 --> 02:30:59,630
We have to talk about shit. And if we
stopped talking about shit, we're dead.

2557
02:31:00,380 --> 02:31:04,190
And you know, you might not agree with
me, you might agree with me, whatever,

2558
02:31:04,430 --> 02:31:08,030
but at least we can come here. We
can talk about shit. But you know,

2559
02:31:08,060 --> 02:31:11,630
if you can't talk about shit
or the way you're talking,

2560
02:31:11,660 --> 02:31:15,770
this is what's really important and this
is what's really resonating with people

2561
02:31:15,950 --> 02:31:20,130
that are listening to this podcast or
watching it. We're talking in a way,

2562
02:31:20,130 --> 02:31:24,630
I mean, I joked around about
Anderson Cooper. He's seems
like a nice guy. He's gay.

2563
02:31:24,631 --> 02:31:27,240
He's probably been fucked with his
whole life. He's probably fine.

2564
02:31:27,241 --> 02:31:28,650
I bet if you sit down with them,
he's fine.

2565
02:31:29,400 --> 02:31:33,390
I bet a good percentage of the shield he
puts up is just to try to keep his job

2566
02:31:33,540 --> 02:31:36,870
as a gay albino and a fucking white
man's world. You know what I mean?

2567
02:31:37,260 --> 02:31:41,550
But the reality is that guy can't do this.
Well if Shane,

2568
02:31:42,120 --> 02:31:46,230
if Shane Smith wants to go out and have
his own podcast and you do it in a sumo

2569
02:31:46,231 --> 02:31:46,920
diaper,

2570
02:31:46,920 --> 02:31:51,540
one of those crazy sumo diapers and you
have all these Thai lady boys around you

2571
02:31:51,660 --> 02:31:54,940
and you're drinking fucking drinks
with umbrellas in it and your, your,

2572
02:31:54,941 --> 02:31:59,010
your smoking big spliffs but you're still
talking about the world and important

2573
02:31:59,011 --> 02:32:02,160
points, people will still
listen. You know why?

2574
02:32:02,161 --> 02:32:07,161
Because you're being what is absolutely
100% lacking in all of corporate

2575
02:32:08,431 --> 02:32:12,540
controlled media and that is
authentic. Well, what's missing?

2576
02:32:13,040 --> 02:32:13,761
I will say this,

2577
02:32:13,761 --> 02:32:16,800
I don't know Anderson Cooper and I
don't know most of these lives in our

2578
02:32:16,801 --> 02:32:20,690
firehouse, but, but what I will say is,

2579
02:32:20,870 --> 02:32:25,100
and this is a big deal
for me anyways personally,

2580
02:32:25,490 --> 02:32:29,690
is we were in negotiations
with Time Warner and we were
in negotiation and a lot

2581
02:32:29,691 --> 02:32:33,230
of people and uh, you know, I
could have made a lot of money.

2582
02:32:33,430 --> 02:32:37,970
They want an Anderson Cooper and you'd
go on a cruise. That would be no problem.

2583
02:32:37,971 --> 02:32:42,971
I'll go on a cruise with anyone know what
w like what are the thing is everyone

2584
02:32:43,701 --> 02:32:48,320
wants control. Right? And I
fought very hard to keep control.

2585
02:32:48,350 --> 02:32:51,900
I don't even know why. Quite frankly
that's, that's beyond because this is,

2586
02:32:51,901 --> 02:32:56,420
it goes back to the one day you wake up
and say, I got the money. I won the game.

2587
02:32:56,421 --> 02:32:59,900
What the fuck am I doing?
Why am I fighting so hard for control?

2588
02:32:59,900 --> 02:33:03,530
I vote 95% of the board and
largest single shareholder advice.

2589
02:33:03,800 --> 02:33:08,000
Why did I do that? Why didn't I take
money off the board and spend it? I'm not,

2590
02:33:08,440 --> 02:33:11,780
by the way, I'm not setting myself up. I
don't know the answer to that question,

2591
02:33:12,590 --> 02:33:16,790
but at least for now I
run fucking vice now.

2592
02:33:16,820 --> 02:33:21,680
I don't run it perfectly because a lot
of shit gets through that shouldn't get

2593
02:33:21,681 --> 02:33:24,710
through and a lot of things happen that
shouldn't happen cause I don't have

2594
02:33:24,711 --> 02:33:27,890
enough time in the day and
there's a bottleneck and I
have to get better at that.

2595
02:33:28,580 --> 02:33:33,580
But the thing is is I was able
to launch vice news by myself.

2596
02:33:33,951 --> 02:33:37,730
I was able to launch a vice. He was,
we're up for Peabody's and poachers.

2597
02:33:37,731 --> 02:33:41,750
I just wanted to the Knight
Foundation Award for Journalism,

2598
02:33:41,751 --> 02:33:44,300
which is great and I never
had heard of that shit.

2599
02:33:44,450 --> 02:33:48,620
Well I was trying to start a party.
I was trying to talk to a girl,

2600
02:33:48,740 --> 02:33:52,610
but she was like, yeah, I just won
that night ward for Knight Foundation,

2601
02:33:52,611 --> 02:33:56,780
Cock suckers. In any case, what I'm trying
to be, I'm trying to do a humble brag,

2602
02:33:57,170 --> 02:34:01,010
but what I'm trying to say is,
what I'm trying to say is I could do that.

2603
02:34:01,220 --> 02:34:03,740
I could say, you know what?
I'm going to override my board.

2604
02:34:03,741 --> 02:34:07,490
I'm going to override everybody going
override my investors and I'm going to

2605
02:34:07,491 --> 02:34:10,790
invest in news when everyone says you
shouldn't because there's no money to be

2606
02:34:10,791 --> 02:34:14,600
made news. Which is true, but
guess what? We did it. Why?

2607
02:34:14,720 --> 02:34:17,170
Because it's fucking important.
You're a guy.

2608
02:34:17,171 --> 02:34:19,990
You don't have to do any of this shit.
You're in fucking Hollywood.

2609
02:34:19,991 --> 02:34:21,310
You're celebrated motherfucker.

2610
02:34:21,311 --> 02:34:24,310
You can come out here and you can not
do fucking anything and fucking kill it.

2611
02:34:24,700 --> 02:34:29,700
Now what I'd like to say is you got to
medium old guys here who like a fucking

2612
02:34:31,421 --> 02:34:34,840
few drinks and by the way were regular
dudes who just grew up and said, hey,

2613
02:34:34,841 --> 02:34:38,860
I watch Scooby doo when I was young and
then I did this and I did that and now

2614
02:34:38,861 --> 02:34:42,610
we're just sitting here that said,
I believe that we're in the majority.

2615
02:34:42,730 --> 02:34:45,790
I believe that us and people
like us are in the majority.

2616
02:34:45,791 --> 02:34:48,220
And then we look and shit now and say,
hold on a second,

2617
02:34:48,520 --> 02:34:52,660
all these old motherfuckers are dying
off. We control this country. Now,

2618
02:34:52,690 --> 02:34:56,560
not only this country, but probably,
you know, the West, you know,

2619
02:34:56,920 --> 02:34:58,780
with our money and with our politics,

2620
02:34:59,050 --> 02:35:03,580
why are we still doing all this shitty
stuff? The only guy that does it,

2621
02:35:03,581 --> 02:35:04,780
we can weak out and says,

2622
02:35:04,781 --> 02:35:08,200
why are we still doing the shitty
stuff is fucking Joe Rogan.

2623
02:35:08,590 --> 02:35:12,220
Now Anderson Cooper, what he does is sits
there and says, here's the storm here,

2624
02:35:12,221 --> 02:35:13,054
or whatever there.

2625
02:35:13,270 --> 02:35:17,710
So sort of weatherman. He's a
weatherman. So for me, by the way,

2626
02:35:17,800 --> 02:35:20,530
I'll tell you what I'll
tell you right now, Fox,

2627
02:35:20,531 --> 02:35:25,090
CNN up the ass and fuck
all mainstream media.

2628
02:35:25,091 --> 02:35:26,650
Fuck Fox News up the ass.

2629
02:35:27,040 --> 02:35:30,280
But what I will say is we'll at least try,

2630
02:35:30,340 --> 02:35:34,240
I'm not going to just say fuck CNN
and not try to be better than them.

2631
02:35:34,510 --> 02:35:39,160
I believe in the first eight months
of vice that we were better than CNN.

2632
02:35:39,460 --> 02:35:43,720
We're up for all the awards, right?
We are rating better than CNN.

2633
02:35:44,050 --> 02:35:47,230
And by the way, we're not doing
it great. We're not perfect.

2634
02:35:47,231 --> 02:35:50,620
We're not fucking doing a great, but
we're going to get there now, certainly,

2635
02:35:50,621 --> 02:35:54,760
you know, you know we fucking
broke Ebola. We broke all isis.

2636
02:35:54,761 --> 02:35:58,000
We were the first in Ukraine.
We were the Fox first and guys,

2637
02:35:58,420 --> 02:36:01,930
but guess who the fucking people.
I'm going to go talk about that.

2638
02:36:01,930 --> 02:36:06,520
What does you fuck CNN and fuck 60
minutes that they had their time.

2639
02:36:06,521 --> 02:36:07,354
So rude.

2640
02:36:07,570 --> 02:36:12,570
I can't be a part of this because I was
about to do a deal with Larry King to

2641
02:36:12,641 --> 02:36:16,040
relaunch Larry King lives
fine, but he's gone. He's,

2642
02:36:16,540 --> 02:36:18,880
he's going to do his own thing.
That's why I'm on the Internet now.

2643
02:36:18,910 --> 02:36:22,540
He should do his own thing an mean.
It's probably should do their own thing.

2644
02:36:22,570 --> 02:36:23,830
But if we found that they get more,

2645
02:36:23,890 --> 02:36:26,780
he gets more views using the internet
than he ever did, but he will though.

2646
02:36:26,830 --> 02:36:29,530
He will probably, he
will. Of course he was.

2647
02:36:29,680 --> 02:36:31,540
We just got somebody behind
them with some shackles.

2648
02:36:31,960 --> 02:36:34,340
Give them some growth hormones.
I would,

2649
02:36:34,900 --> 02:36:38,020
I would back him except for the
fact that he's fucking oldest.

2650
02:36:38,360 --> 02:36:41,420
[inaudible] we're all going
to be fucking old. Well,

2651
02:36:41,570 --> 02:36:44,470
I'm not going to be a holding.
He was old and he was Timothy leary.

2652
02:36:44,471 --> 02:36:49,320
You'd back them. I don't know.
I'm not an old gangster. Yeah.

2653
02:36:49,620 --> 02:36:50,970
You think so?
Yeah.

2654
02:36:51,280 --> 02:36:53,560
Don't you think that somewhere along
the line science will save you.

2655
02:36:54,280 --> 02:36:57,580
Science will step in and just shut
the liver. Regeneration. Peggy,

2656
02:36:57,581 --> 02:37:02,390
give Shane a shot and lose their
breast. I'd either liver cancer, peace

2657
02:37:02,550 --> 02:37:03,210
and I was like,

2658
02:37:03,210 --> 02:37:06,990
I will literally give you all my money
if you can fucking care my liver cancer

2659
02:37:07,500 --> 02:37:08,430
because excuse me.

2660
02:37:08,431 --> 02:37:12,030
And I know it's in the mail cause I like
to drink booze and I gotta tell you I

2661
02:37:12,031 --> 02:37:14,950
like to drink booze or it food.
I like to sleep. I'm essential.

2662
02:37:16,120 --> 02:37:21,050
Sensualist you like senses? I like
sensual. I think. Yeah. Who doesn't?

2663
02:37:21,440 --> 02:37:24,760
I want to find that fine.
Have you ever been an experience?

2664
02:37:24,970 --> 02:37:29,390
I want to find that guy wants be known.
Ah, Robin and cane on his dick all day.

2665
02:37:29,690 --> 02:37:33,590
Who is he? That guy. You only live once
and then you're dead for a long time.

2666
02:37:33,620 --> 02:37:37,430
That's what I'm saying, Dawg. Fuck
all those people that disagree.

2667
02:37:37,940 --> 02:37:40,610
Sensory experiences.
One of the beautiful things about life,

2668
02:37:40,640 --> 02:37:42,320
the greatest thing about life is life.

2669
02:37:42,980 --> 02:37:45,800
Enjoy your fucking shit
no matter what it is.

2670
02:37:45,801 --> 02:37:48,770
And then you're going to be dead
for a long time. So just do it.

2671
02:37:49,280 --> 02:37:51,740
The more the older I get,
the more I'm just like,

2672
02:37:51,770 --> 02:37:55,940
I'm going to enjoy the shit out of this
motherfucker. That's what I'm saying.

2673
02:37:56,320 --> 02:37:59,950
Yeah. The older I get, the
of the mortality this is,

2674
02:38:00,460 --> 02:38:04,010
that's set this God damn thing
on fire and go. When I was 20,

2675
02:38:04,011 --> 02:38:06,230
I didn't think it was going to
end when I was 30. I was like,

2676
02:38:06,231 --> 02:38:09,290
this shit's going to end way in the
future when I'm 40. I'm like, Hey,

2677
02:38:09,291 --> 02:38:14,090
when does this end now I'm 47. I'm like,
um, how much time do I have left? Those,

2678
02:38:14,150 --> 02:38:16,040
those are the, the, the steps,

2679
02:38:16,070 --> 02:38:21,070
the mortality of the 20s is staggering
to me now because I used to,

2680
02:38:22,580 --> 02:38:26,620
I used to just think it's all going to go
on for it. Well, I have a buddy and uh,

2681
02:38:26,710 --> 02:38:29,270
he, he called me once
and he goes, you know,

2682
02:38:29,271 --> 02:38:33,200
what's the scariest fucking thing in
the world? Teenage boys. Oh fuck. Yeah.

2683
02:38:33,410 --> 02:38:36,980
And I go, why? He goes, well, I was the
scariest. Yeah. He goes, they don't know.

2684
02:38:37,010 --> 02:38:37,780
They don't know.
They can,

2685
02:38:37,780 --> 02:38:41,630
they want to make a name and they want
to fuck shit up and smash shit. Yeah.

2686
02:38:41,800 --> 02:38:46,800
And it's true and I think that that's one
of the weird things about life is that

2687
02:38:47,530 --> 02:38:52,220
no one comes out of the box with any
sort of understanding of what the,

2688
02:38:52,400 --> 02:38:55,760
the grand spectrum of this experience is.

2689
02:38:55,761 --> 02:39:00,761
The scariest thing in
life is teenage boys done.

2690
02:39:01,490 --> 02:39:05,630
Cause they don't give a fuck. I was a
teenage boy and I would fuck the shit up.

2691
02:39:06,230 --> 02:39:09,530
And every time, I mean, if you, doesn't
matter if you're in Africa, Afghanistan,

2692
02:39:09,531 --> 02:39:12,650
whatever, if you see a bunch of
teenage kids with guns, you're fucked.

2693
02:39:12,920 --> 02:39:15,800
If you see a guy with a gray beard,
you're like, I can talk to this guy.

2694
02:39:16,180 --> 02:39:18,500
Talk to this guy. Yeah,
no, you, he's right.

2695
02:39:18,630 --> 02:39:22,220
That's the scariest thing in
life is teenage. Well, intro

2696
02:39:22,400 --> 02:39:27,050
in, in understanding of that or
in, in consideration of that,

2697
02:39:27,110 --> 02:39:30,950
the scariest thing in life is really
ignorance is power and ignorance together.

2698
02:39:31,220 --> 02:39:34,730
And when you're 18 and where
you and you're a young man,

2699
02:39:34,940 --> 02:39:39,500
your idea of what you you can
accomplish once you start getting laid.

2700
02:39:39,740 --> 02:39:42,830
Once you win your first
fistfight, once you, you know,

2701
02:39:42,831 --> 02:39:45,050
you're at the top of the
world, it's like you, you,

2702
02:39:45,160 --> 02:39:47,480
you get into this
experience in life where,

2703
02:39:47,900 --> 02:39:51,800
because of the limited amount of
information that you've been exposed to,

2704
02:39:51,801 --> 02:39:53,720
the limited amount of
people that you've met,

2705
02:39:54,200 --> 02:39:59,090
the limited amount of friends
that you've had, you start,

2706
02:39:59,600 --> 02:40:04,280
you start forming your world
and your world is so small.

2707
02:40:04,340 --> 02:40:05,270
It's so tiny.

2708
02:40:05,540 --> 02:40:08,980
But you think because of the limited
amount of experience that you have,

2709
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:10,250
you think that this is what's up.

2710
02:40:15,310 --> 02:40:18,980
We'd live living in New York too.
Long time. They're all fucked.

2711
02:40:18,990 --> 02:40:22,980
Fake eyelash surely can't talk as Joe
Rogan smokes, the strongest bond left,

2712
02:40:23,580 --> 02:40:27,720
but you're right. Speed we
represent. I think that the,

2713
02:40:27,880 --> 02:40:31,790
you were exactly right
in that when I was young,

2714
02:40:32,300 --> 02:40:36,050
I would tell you,
I knew what the fuck I was talking about.

2715
02:40:36,440 --> 02:40:41,030
I would tell you I understood mortality.
I would tell you all this shit,

2716
02:40:41,480 --> 02:40:42,950
but the fact of the matter is,

2717
02:40:43,310 --> 02:40:48,310
no matter how bad the fight or how drunk
I was driving my car home or jumping

2718
02:40:49,101 --> 02:40:53,720
off the bridge into the water or all
the stupid shit I did when I was young,

2719
02:40:54,830 --> 02:40:59,330
in the back of my mind,
I believed that I would never die.

2720
02:41:00,170 --> 02:41:05,170
And even because I hung out with this
gang of kids and a bunch of them died from

2721
02:41:05,391 --> 02:41:09,380
drug overdoses and a bunch of
them die from car accidents
and he says, said, shit,

2722
02:41:09,980 --> 02:41:14,780
there's nothing sadder than a teenager
die. But the thing is is quite frankly,

2723
02:41:15,170 --> 02:41:17,510
they all died from the boring shit.

2724
02:41:17,511 --> 02:41:20,390
They all died from you got wasted
and you fucking hit the car.

2725
02:41:20,390 --> 02:41:23,660
You got fucking wasted to use
overdose or whatever the fuck it is.

2726
02:41:24,380 --> 02:41:27,530
And you look at it now and go,
you know how much you missed, man,

2727
02:41:28,040 --> 02:41:32,630
you know how much of all this crazy
fucking shit you didn't get to see.

2728
02:41:32,960 --> 02:41:36,410
You know? And at that
point you're like, look,

2729
02:41:37,640 --> 02:41:42,640
I was the dumbest mother fucker on
earth when I left home at 14 and I got

2730
02:41:43,210 --> 02:41:47,930
progressively dumber until I was probably
in my mid twenties and I think when

2731
02:41:47,931 --> 02:41:52,520
mortality comes and gets you,
and this is, I dunno about you,

2732
02:41:52,521 --> 02:41:56,030
but it's hit me,
is every day is fucking awesome.

2733
02:41:57,320 --> 02:41:57,721
You know,
I,

2734
02:41:57,721 --> 02:42:02,720
I see the worst shit in the world everyday
with politics and with poverty and

2735
02:42:02,721 --> 02:42:07,040
with the environment, whatever
the fuck it is. But guess what?

2736
02:42:07,400 --> 02:42:08,450
Fucking life.

2737
02:42:08,460 --> 02:42:12,150
This is fucking awesome. If
you're healthy, life is amazing.

2738
02:42:12,180 --> 02:42:13,950
If you're a healthy life is,
you're healthy,

2739
02:42:14,010 --> 02:42:16,530
if you're healthy and you have friends,
that's the big one.

2740
02:42:16,860 --> 02:42:19,710
That's why solitary confinement
is the darkest shit of all time.

2741
02:42:20,410 --> 02:42:24,310
Hold on. And this goes back to our first
point. If you're out to be healthy,

2742
02:42:24,340 --> 02:42:28,930
you're right, you got to, you know, have
friends, family, somebody's out there.

2743
02:42:28,990 --> 02:42:32,530
You know, you got to enjoy your
shit. You know, enjoy your food,

2744
02:42:32,531 --> 02:42:35,290
enjoy your fucking sleep and joy,
your book, whatever the fuck it is.

2745
02:42:36,130 --> 02:42:39,580
But the other thing is,
is if you don't have future,

2746
02:42:39,940 --> 02:42:44,080
if you don't have like I
tomorrow's going to be good too.

2747
02:42:44,740 --> 02:42:45,910
You know,
then you're fucked.

2748
02:42:45,911 --> 02:42:49,210
And that's why we all have to
participate in that shit. Sorry I

2749
02:42:49,290 --> 02:42:51,540
caught you off guard. It's
inevitable. I mean we're,

2750
02:42:51,541 --> 02:42:54,210
we're all participating because
it's inevitable. I mean we're,

2751
02:42:54,211 --> 02:42:57,660
we're all a part of
this crazy growing wave.

2752
02:42:58,640 --> 02:42:59,090
Okay,

2753
02:42:59,090 --> 02:43:02,240
I'm going to have become addicted
to your, it's good for you, dude.

2754
02:43:02,241 --> 02:43:03,810
Don't be scared it a life.

2755
02:43:03,840 --> 02:43:08,840
It's going to just calm me down
and soothe you and relax your soul.

2756
02:43:10,370 --> 02:43:13,180
But if had,
if I had you all over again,

2757
02:43:13,181 --> 02:43:16,930
I would realize that every day is fucking
just, I think you will have to kill it.

2758
02:43:17,050 --> 02:43:18,460
I think if you had to
do it all over again,

2759
02:43:18,461 --> 02:43:20,740
you do it exactly the same
because if you didn't,

2760
02:43:20,741 --> 02:43:23,210
you would never learn the lessons
that you learned. You know? I mean,

2761
02:43:23,300 --> 02:43:28,090
I'm not claiming that I've
gone the perfect path, but I,

2762
02:43:28,780 --> 02:43:33,400
I, every fucking disaster I've ever been
a part of, every mistake I've ever made.

2763
02:43:33,670 --> 02:43:37,750
It's made me humble, reconsider,
or be more considerate,

2764
02:43:37,780 --> 02:43:42,580
be more introspective, be more
observant, be more objective.

2765
02:43:42,940 --> 02:43:47,620
It's just look at it from, you
have to fuck up. You can't,
everybody that fucks up,

2766
02:43:47,621 --> 02:43:50,230
they feel like they're a bad person
cause they fucked up. But no,

2767
02:43:50,231 --> 02:43:53,980
you're just a person.
Hopefully you didn't fuck up too bad.

2768
02:43:54,070 --> 02:43:57,910
That's how you learn by fucking
up. Yeah. It's a bit when it, when,

2769
02:43:57,960 --> 02:44:01,090
when you're killing it, you're like,
Oh yeah, I'm smart in some of the best.

2770
02:44:01,270 --> 02:44:04,760
Exactly what you learn by
fucking up. That's what people
hate, right? What do we,

2771
02:44:04,990 --> 02:44:07,940
what do we hate more than anything?
We hate cockiness, right? Yeah.

2772
02:44:08,140 --> 02:44:11,830
It's one of those. But yeah, people
hate more than anything, which is yes,

2773
02:44:11,920 --> 02:44:15,850
it's true. And I've learned that the
hard way because I like being cocky.

2774
02:44:16,210 --> 02:44:20,230
I like guys, I like saying I'm going to
fucking kill it. And I'm like, other guys,

2775
02:44:20,231 --> 02:44:22,810
I like beat guys go and say,
and they're going to come if they don't,

2776
02:44:22,840 --> 02:44:25,750
that's coming. Whatever.
That's bro. No, but I do,

2777
02:44:25,751 --> 02:44:28,750
I like people being confident and
going out there and doing that shit.

2778
02:44:29,910 --> 02:44:33,220
It's Bible. Well, my old man always
said to me when I was young, he goes,

2779
02:44:34,300 --> 02:44:39,070
they're going to tell you life is fair.
That's not true.

2780
02:44:39,760 --> 02:44:41,440
He goes,
life is brutal.

2781
02:44:41,620 --> 02:44:45,400
You have to be the smartest
and the toughest and you
have to win and you have to

2782
02:44:45,401 --> 02:44:47,360
be there in the right
place at the right time.

2783
02:44:47,390 --> 02:44:50,130
Even then if you have a little
Dick, you're fucked. Well,

2784
02:44:50,160 --> 02:44:53,280
cause I have a huge dick you that
didn't come into it. But no, he,

2785
02:44:53,290 --> 02:44:55,330
it was just like he was,
he was,

2786
02:44:55,600 --> 02:44:58,840
he was like honest
because that's the truth.

2787
02:44:59,200 --> 02:45:02,560
It's fucking hard. Yeah, it's hard.

2788
02:45:02,770 --> 02:45:05,170
And you have to have a
little bit of luck as well.

2789
02:45:05,530 --> 02:45:09,280
And everyone off tells their kids, it's
fine, it's good, it's gonna be great.

2790
02:45:09,580 --> 02:45:12,280
And my old man was like anxious
going to be fucking hard.

2791
02:45:12,281 --> 02:45:15,790
So you better really fucking tried to
hit it because if you get fucked up,

2792
02:45:16,180 --> 02:45:20,410
it's only going to travel with you.
And at that point you're,

2793
02:45:20,560 --> 02:45:24,610
you sit there and go, honesty
goes a long way. We're are wasted.

2794
02:45:24,611 --> 02:45:26,170
We should probably go.
And I got to get them

2795
02:45:28,460 --> 02:45:33,460
best ending of a podcast
ever a long drunk and rent.

2796
02:45:33,860 --> 02:45:34,730
And we should probably get

2797
02:45:34,820 --> 02:45:39,450
out of here because it's only
gonna get worse from now on for me.

2798
02:45:39,500 --> 02:45:44,240
Shane's bad mother fucker. You,
every time we talk, I feel inspired.

2799
02:45:44,320 --> 02:45:48,410
You're a bad mother fucker, dude. The next
time we were, we have a rule, a new rule.

2800
02:45:48,411 --> 02:45:52,290
Next podcast. It be no complimenting
each other, either one at all. Done.

2801
02:45:52,550 --> 02:45:57,440
I love you, but it's enough.
Enough already. We're getting
ridiculous. Uh, you're,

2802
02:45:57,441 --> 02:46:00,620
you're the best man. I appreciate you
very much. Appreciate you very much.

2803
02:46:00,650 --> 02:46:02,870
I appreciate you coming out to.
Thank you. All right fuckers.

2804
02:46:02,871 --> 02:46:07,340
We'll be right back in about 10 minutes
with the Great Ari Shaffir bull pin it.

2805
02:46:09,370 --> 02:46:10,750
I got an RS holder on that.
