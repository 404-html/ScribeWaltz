1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,740
Finally,
Jesus Christ,

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:08,040
the Joe Rogan experience is brought to
you by [inaudible] dot com that's o,

3
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:12,750
n n I t, makers of a Alpha brain
and shroom tech, shrink tech,

4
00:00:12,751 --> 00:00:15,990
sports room, tech, immune
and mostly summary. Uh,

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,640
we started carrying battle ropes and
kettle bells and if you're interested in

6
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,560
getting fit and doing some manly type
shit, there's no manly more cave band.

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,690
Conan the barbarian type shit and throwing
ropes around and lift in Canon balls

8
00:00:30,691 --> 00:00:34,500
with handles home. It's what I do
for all my strength and conditioning.

9
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,030
All I do is I do chin ups,

10
00:00:36,031 --> 00:00:39,600
I do body weight squats and I do a bunch
of crazy exercises with kettle bells

11
00:00:39,601 --> 00:00:41,010
and it's fucking fantastic.

12
00:00:41,011 --> 00:00:44,610
It's the best I've ever found as far
as things that translate directly to

13
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:47,670
athletic activities. I don't think
there's anything better than kettle bells.

14
00:00:47,671 --> 00:00:50,840
I think it's one of the most phenomenal
ways to exercise in the world you're at.

15
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,960
You're supporting a,

16
00:00:51,961 --> 00:00:55,920
a big heavy ball of steel iron rather,

17
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,830
and you're supporting them with your
body and going through all these

18
00:00:58,831 --> 00:01:00,090
complicated motions.
And it,

19
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,110
what it does is it makes your body work
as one unit instead of just doing bicep

20
00:01:04,111 --> 00:01:07,320
curls and shit like that.
And it makes your body strong as one unit.

21
00:01:07,321 --> 00:01:11,970
So it works in a natural way when you
have to use it for sports. Do you should,

22
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:16,330
uh, if you're, if you're interested in
Kettlebells, we'd sell them as cheap as,

23
00:01:16,331 --> 00:01:19,650
as humanly possible and they are
the best quality available there.

24
00:01:19,651 --> 00:01:24,330
Troy kettlebells and these motherfuckers
will be here after nuclear bombs go off

25
00:01:24,331 --> 00:01:27,180
in the super volcano erupts.
They're huge, they're the,

26
00:01:27,181 --> 00:01:29,470
they have these big fat handles
on them and they're there.

27
00:01:29,471 --> 00:01:30,660
The really the perfect kettle bells,

28
00:01:30,661 --> 00:01:32,730
you can't get any better and
they will last you forever.

29
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:34,170
You buy these fucking things,

30
00:01:34,171 --> 00:01:36,840
they never break and you keep
them for the rest of your life.

31
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:40,710
It's really that simple and it's an
awesome investment as far as fitness goes.

32
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:44,880
And the new tropics, all the Alpha
brain and shroom tech, all that stuff.

33
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,380

37
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:57,210
The reason being is that we want
no one to ever feel ripped off.

stuff that we think you're,
you're absolutely going to enjoy.

40
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,480
There's a bunch of science behind it,

41
00:02:06,481 --> 00:02:10,670
a bunch of experiments and tests and
different trials that have gone on about

42
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,120
the various ingredients. If you go to
[inaudible] dot com that's o and n and it,

43
00:02:15,121 --> 00:02:19,470
there's all sorts of information. Use a
code name, Rogan, save yourself 10% off.

44
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,590
All Right, ladies and gentlemen,
buckle. Buckle the fucking Andrew dice.

45
00:02:22,591 --> 00:02:25,790
Clay is here. Ladies and gentlemen,
Cube's music. Brian, let's make it up.

46
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:29,933
Experience

47
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:33,530
[inaudible].

48
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:38,470
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have with us,

49
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,080
not just Eleanor Kerrigan,

50
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:45,490
not just Max Silverstein,
but Andrew dice clay as well.

51
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:49,450
This is a fucking phenomenal show.
You're so strong in everything.

52
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:53,230
In the meantime, I can't get the
coffee to come out of my car.

53
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,350
There's something wrong with the lid
that you got to pull the lid back.

54
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:59,980
Oh really? I thought that
was right. Does that happen

55
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:04,470
trying to drink it? Is it a faulty
one? Oh I didn't see them lifted.

56
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,350
Yeah. Can everybody just
be Starbucks? Why does it,

57
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:12,530
it's like Cain gorgeous,
isn't everything

58
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,710
pumpkin. That was pretty easy.
That's, that's sad. She's, she's

59
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,620
now,
you know why I got around?

60
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,200
One of the things that I enjoy
about being around you, man,

61
00:03:23,201 --> 00:03:26,840
I said life is theater 24 seven.
I don't know why you say

62
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:32,060
it's the end of the dressing room.
It was,

63
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:37,330
you're a fun fucking dude to be
around and I've liked that about you.

64
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,560
I've really learnt that about Yo cause
we didn't know each other that well and

65
00:03:41,561 --> 00:03:44,580
now we've become what I would call
friends. You'll have to look friend,

66
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:49,420
not be honored text.
We text all caps.

67
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,850
No, no, I have to do it that way
or else I can't see what I'm doing.

68
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,520
So it's not like you know
how they say when you text,

69
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:00,790
you can make the lord the font larger.
I've, that's what I've had to do.

70
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:04,690
I don't use that kind of phone. I don't
use that. Oh, you don't use an iPhone? No.

71
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:09,400
How dare you? I use commando. Commando.

72
00:04:09,401 --> 00:04:13,390
You could talk 300 feet under water with
it. Oh, is it one of those Verizon ones?

73
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:16,240
Crazy ones. So let's say
you've got one for a disaster.

74
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:21,370
You're having a fight with a guy, right?
Right, right. And you were on the beach.

75
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:25,480
Everyone into the water. I go underneath
that could call the cops and say,

76
00:04:25,481 --> 00:04:29,310
I've got a problem over here.
I mean,

77
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:34,210
what a fucking making phones to
talk on the water. Got It. Yeah.

78
00:04:34,211 --> 00:04:37,420
I thought about going that way.
I tried it in my pool.

79
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,830
It's like I think of what do you want to,
what kind of car do you like to drug?

80
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,080
Do you draw like to drive a sports car
or do you want to drive like a military

81
00:04:44,081 --> 00:04:46,330
Humvee? I mean you've got two
different ways and looking at things.

82
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,260
One is I'm going to just assume that
these roads are going to be like this and

83
00:04:50,261 --> 00:04:53,560
then I can get around on him pretty
easy and just [inaudible] it's fun.

84
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:58,000
Or I can pretend that the shit could hit
the fan and every moment and all of a

85
00:04:58,001 --> 00:05:00,950
sudden I'm driving through the fucking
desert. That's what I like. Fine.

86
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,790
Racketing eat to stay alive.
I like an industrial

87
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:10,870
trucks. I do one. Yeah.

88
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:16,060
Big fucking machine. Stay
back. I got a challenge it too.

89
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,180
But that to me is an industrial sports
because you have one of the new ones.

90
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:22,990
Yeah, that's what is the black
stripe. They nailed that car.

91
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:26,820
They really like replicated
a seventies muscle car. They,

92
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:31,030
they get it though.
So listen dage throw me a favor here.

93
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:35,560
Make like, um, the
convertible version. Nothing.

94
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:39,220
Nothing will be cooler than that. And
convertible. Yeah. You think you're right?

95
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:43,960
Yeah. Like the tutor convertible guy
that that's going to do this already

96
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,650
10 years. I mean camair
rod does it. They all,

97
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:52,510
it's a fucking challenge at the top
down. Yeah. What the fuck? Dodge. Really,

98
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:57,500
what is that?
Right?

99
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:58,160
Every time

100
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,360
you open the Sunroof,

101
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:03,440
you want to close it because the sun's
now beating on you through this little

102
00:06:03,441 --> 00:06:07,940
fucking old, either one. It
open and not open talking.

103
00:06:07,941 --> 00:06:11,900
When I'm done talking,
you start to question,

104
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:15,580
ask it when I'm done. 24, seven no,

105
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:19,880
he's got to know how to, you know, keep
them in line. Keeping in line the a,

106
00:06:19,881 --> 00:06:23,660
the four 27 corvette is the
best American car available now.

107
00:06:23,661 --> 00:06:28,570
Have you seen that now? But to me that's
too, I like a big muscle doom this.

108
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,230
They took,
uh,

109
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:35,250
they finally took the Xeo six suspension
and Xeo six engine and they put it in a

110
00:06:36,141 --> 00:06:38,870
convertible zero six was the
fucking race car and that was,

111
00:06:38,871 --> 00:06:42,740
they took a regular corvette and then
the zero six was 505 horsepower and

112
00:06:42,741 --> 00:06:46,880
fucking racing suspension,
big fat, almost slick tires.

113
00:06:46,881 --> 00:06:50,510
It's the craziest car ever. And now
they're making it as a convertible,

114
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:55,210
which is the first time that cafe brand
and the publicists, but publicists,

115
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:58,930
he's got, he's got that does Corvettes
are ridiculous. They're ridiculous.

116
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:03,300
Call the band, but then it's getting out
of it. That's the hard part. Well it's,

117
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:07,790
you know, it's also a plastic car
because everything is broken. Everything.

118
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:12,830
Everything from disintegrating
feet, shoulders, you know.

119
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,310
Well in a way that disintegrate.

120
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,200
Well I think a mother or father time.
Fuck it is.

121
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:25,410
I know when I close my face every night
going to open my hand. Wait, let it,

122
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,860
it snaps. Doesn't you are
wearing gloves though? No, no.

123
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,770
It's even worse when there
were no gloves on. Yeah,

124
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:35,990
like the joints get stiff and
then they got to like pop open.

125
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:40,370
Did you really start wearing gloves
because it's like this for three hours.

126
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:44,360
Did you really start wearing gloves
because too many people were shaking your

127
00:07:44,361 --> 00:07:47,930
hands? You were worried about like getting
sick or, I don't mind shaking hands,

128
00:07:47,931 --> 00:07:51,170
I just can't take sweaty hand.
Yeah. You know what I mean?

129
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:55,190
So I invented a way to shake hands
without actually touching skin to skin.

130
00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:00,620
No. Because you know a lot of people
today, I mean look up me dressed,

131
00:08:00,621 --> 00:08:03,770
how sloppy they are with the
genes that they look like.

132
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:06,830
They're going to take half a shit out
of that page as the walking down the

133
00:08:06,831 --> 00:08:11,710
street with the flip flops,
the hygiene with their hands,

134
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:15,750
they probably get the fingers in that
that Reyes crack half the time I scratch

135
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,520
them and then using the keyboard. Right.
You know what I'm talking about. I know.

136
00:08:19,521 --> 00:08:21,480
You know what I'm talking. Oh, I
know what you're talking about.

137
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:24,620
Shake a lot of hands.
Well, so you're with me.

138
00:08:24,621 --> 00:08:27,950
When the in the disdain of people who
wear their fucking pants buckled around

139
00:08:27,951 --> 00:08:31,310
their dick, it's sickening. There
is a problem with that folks.

140
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:35,870
That is just stupid and people have
said, man, you're so wrong dude.

141
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:39,770
You just fucking, you just talking
shit about style. You're being silly.

142
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:42,680
You know nothing sexy about it.
It's not style.

143
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:47,020
That is crazy pants. It's
not lazy. It's insane.

144
00:08:47,021 --> 00:08:51,380
I know when I see a girl or a guy walking
around like they took a dump in that

145
00:08:51,381 --> 00:08:55,530
pant. It's the last thing I want
to talk to. Yeah, they are one.

146
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:56,460
There's something

147
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:00,840
about it that just shows that all you
have to do is get one charismatic person

148
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:03,720
to do something and then every
asshole wants to follow them.

149
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:08,840
So must've been just one probably bad
ass black dude out of prison to sag his

150
00:09:09,421 --> 00:09:12,960
pants and kept sagging his pants and
then all of a sudden all these fucking

151
00:09:12,961 --> 00:09:17,430
dorks want to copy that guy and it's
become like this thing and the belt buckle

152
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:20,970
where they back up. They literally are
buckling their belt over there. Dick like,

153
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:25,170
you silly. Fuck. You can't even walk.
What do you hobbling yourself? It's like,

154
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:29,490
this is way worse than anybody could
make fun of a woman doing by wearing high

155
00:09:29,491 --> 00:09:30,150
heels.

156
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:33,390
Like at least a woman in high heels can
kind of kick her shoes off if she has to

157
00:09:33,391 --> 00:09:36,180
run. You know what I mean? Those things
aren't high to get off, but if you,

158
00:09:36,181 --> 00:09:40,050
if you're wearing your fucking belt,
buckled around your deck,

159
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:43,440
if somebody wants to beat your ass, you
really don't have a whole lot of options.

160
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:44,370
You're going to get,

161
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:47,340
you're gonna get your fucking ass kicked
unless you want to fight naked by the

162
00:09:47,341 --> 00:09:50,190
time you get those pants off, that
good is gonna beat the shit out of you.

163
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:55,180
You can't even walk right
up your last suit. Joey,

164
00:09:56,070 --> 00:10:00,360
Joey, Joey, Jay, my nickname
field. Jay. Thank you.

165
00:10:00,361 --> 00:10:02,580
And we don't talk about with
the j mean and by the way,

166
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:06,560
I need to get a pair of sunglasses.
The violence that the prescription though.

167
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:11,340
Bad ass though. Those are, I don't
give a fuck sunglasses and I don't,

168
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:13,770
I know you don't. I don't.
I know you don't. I don't.

169
00:10:13,771 --> 00:10:18,140
That's why you got those two classes
of perfect for you Joe [inaudible]

170
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:21,210
Spiderman. We will get,
I'm glad. Let me just say,

171
00:10:21,211 --> 00:10:25,350
we went to see dice in Vegas and it is
one of the rare times that I ever get a

172
00:10:25,351 --> 00:10:29,280
chance to go to see a show actually said
you haven't sat down and watched the

173
00:10:29,281 --> 00:10:30,270
car showing you is,

174
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:33,870
well it had been about a year in the
last time was Norton before that.

175
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,330
Maybe I caught Louis
C k two at the Improv.

176
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:40,680
But you know to go out per on purpose.
We're going to go to Si dice tonight.

177
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:45,300
We're going to go see a show like on
purpose and me and Norton and Bobby Kelly

178
00:10:45,301 --> 00:10:50,220
and Anthony [inaudible] and Sam Roberts
and all my God that we have a good

179
00:10:50,221 --> 00:10:53,760
fucking time. It was so
fun. It was, first of all,

180
00:10:53,761 --> 00:10:57,780
your assigned was fucking great.
It was hilarious. You know,

181
00:10:57,781 --> 00:11:02,460
it was just perfect. Oldschool dice and
I think Anthony said, he goes, he goes,

182
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:06,150
it's beautiful. He's like,
it's still dice, but it's new.

183
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:08,010
Like it's like the same old dice.

184
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,210
Yeah, it's fresh
material. Well, with this,

185
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:14,810
we haven't gotten talking about the
special yet, but my whole idea was,

186
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:18,860
all right, I want to give them
all this new generation stuff,

187
00:11:18,861 --> 00:11:22,370
technology all the way to the fucking pig.
So they walk around with that.

188
00:11:22,371 --> 00:11:26,060
Plus he's at today. I wanted to
give him all that newest stuff,

189
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,110
but yet I want you to put some of the
classic dice stuff that the newer fans

190
00:11:30,111 --> 00:11:33,200
don't know and pepper
that and into the act.

191
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:37,100
So that's why I think he
enjoyed it because you want
to watch and somebody that

192
00:11:37,101 --> 00:11:41,680
all of a sudden is about politics. You
come to see somebody like myself, boy you,

193
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:45,590
you know, we're a certain
brands, so people expect that.

194
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:48,930
And that's what I like doing. Yeah.
You know what I mean? You know, I,

195
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,120
you know all these comics today that
are going to bullshit about, you know,

196
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,250
one little thing

197
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:58,090
they might've sent on stage and
then it's a media event. You know,

198
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,760
it's like the one thing I will,

199
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:05,470
I will let the media know is when my
special is, I'm not thinking of them.

200
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:09,340
I'm thinking of the people that really
want to laugh from my brand to Yuma.

201
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:14,470
I don't care how I say it. I don't give
a fuck what I say to them. You know?

202
00:12:14,471 --> 00:12:19,300
And I'm not apologizing for a fucking
word out of my mouth and I loved that.

203
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,950
I now want to do,
I loved that.

204
00:12:20,951 --> 00:12:24,700
I think it's one of the most important
things in comedy is that there's someone

205
00:12:24,701 --> 00:12:29,590
like you that says that because from
my personal opinion as a standup comedy

206
00:12:29,591 --> 00:12:32,230
fan,
as a connoisseur of Standup,

207
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:36,400
I never thought you'd got the credit that
you deserved amongst comedians because

208
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:40,210
there was a lot of backlash about your
material where they were saying like, oh,

209
00:12:40,211 --> 00:12:41,230
it's sexist. So, oh,

210
00:12:41,231 --> 00:12:46,060
it's homophobic and it is a
legitimate style of comedy.

211
00:12:46,061 --> 00:12:49,450
You're saying ridiculous shit
and it's fucking hilarious.

212
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:52,720
And if you can't recognize
that as an art form,

213
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:57,310
that's your ignorant problem.
It's not that the materials that it's,

214
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:00,220
that's the funny shit to say.
It gets fucked up.

215
00:13:00,221 --> 00:13:03,880
Gay Say something ridiculous if course,
you know what I medically sound advice.

216
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:07,450
I've had people walking out
of my show welcome, you know,

217
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:11,710
cause it in Vegas sometimes they calm
certain people's Holly writers, whatever.

218
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:15,700
So people have walked out that they
didn't like that I said the word fag.

219
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,780
They go,
he calls gay people FHEG and it's like,

220
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:22,940
what's the fucking difference?
It's the point I'm making. Yeah.

221
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:26,910
You know what I mean? You're not making
it hurt. You know, point, you know,

222
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:31,900
these are just different words to say.
Do they have an alternative sex style?

223
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,700
Yeah,
I don't give a fuck what they do.

224
00:13:33,701 --> 00:13:37,240
I don't care if they want to suck dick
all the way to the fucking bus station.

225
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:41,980
That's their choice. But if I'm
doing a bit fake is the word I use.

226
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:47,160
It works better for me than the word
gay or queer or alternative fucking

227
00:13:48,071 --> 00:13:52,300
lifestyle. They suck Dick on
each other and that's okay by me.

228
00:13:52,301 --> 00:13:54,760
I don't want to suck Dick.
And if I date,

229
00:13:54,761 --> 00:13:59,050
I'm telling you right now and have a
hundred Cox laying on my face right now

230
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:03,010
because that's how much it, if I want
it, cause that's how I am about girls.

231
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:07,600
You know what I mean? I like
pussy. It's who I am. You know? So,

232
00:14:07,601 --> 00:14:09,590
so if I'm saying a word like fig,

233
00:14:09,591 --> 00:14:12,640
I'm saying it because that's the
word that works best than the act.

234
00:14:12,641 --> 00:14:15,520
Dumb Herrera had the best
line ever about BNK goes, Joe,

235
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:19,990
I wish I was gay just so I could come out.
That's how little I give a fuck.

236
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:24,350
Is that fucking quit as
Angela Delmarva area?

237
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:27,640
He saw just silly man.
Yeah.

238
00:14:27,641 --> 00:14:30,400
Who fucking cares style comedy.

239
00:14:30,401 --> 00:14:34,030
And I always hold thing about comics,
like being on truck, you know,

240
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:38,020
I went through it, I went through it
in a big fucking way. I mean this guy,

241
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:41,890
but you went through it in a time where
there wasn't that many people doing it

242
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,480
and you sticking to your guns and keeping
your character the way you've always

243
00:14:46,481 --> 00:14:51,260
kept in the inner psychiatrist
ship facades did it? No,

244
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,430
no, but almost, you know, no, I've,

245
00:14:53,431 --> 00:14:56,060
I've done the therapist actually
when my career took off,

246
00:14:56,210 --> 00:15:01,210
I went to a therapist in New York to
see how to handle my family because they

247
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:05,840
got so, you know, because it
happened so quick, you know,

248
00:15:05,841 --> 00:15:10,520
from the clubs to the arena thing
that, you know, my parents and my,

249
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:15,410
my whole family was so excited. It's all
they talk about. So I would be like, look,

250
00:15:15,411 --> 00:15:18,710
I know what I'm doing but let's
talk about other things. You know,

251
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:22,580
I didn't want it to be 24 seven about
me. You know, when I'm on stage,

252
00:15:22,581 --> 00:15:26,840
when I'm working on projects,
I do think constantly of what I'm doing.

253
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,300
But when it's downtime,
like when we came back,

254
00:15:29,301 --> 00:15:32,690
I just got done shooting a half the
woody Allen movie that I'm doing.

255
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:35,420
And so the other night Max is,
you know,

256
00:15:35,421 --> 00:15:37,600
it was sitting outside in
the front porch and he goes,

257
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:41,120
was sitting with my wife Valerie, and
he goes, let's put on the uh, you know,

258
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:44,960
the video camera, what we filmed. And I
said, you know what, now's not the time.

259
00:15:44,961 --> 00:15:47,900
I need a few days just to be myself now.

260
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:52,070
I don't want to just stay on the movie
and watch everything and see me more.

261
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:55,610
It's like, you know, just staying grounded
in what's the most important thing.

262
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,650
Well,
to me that's the whole thing with fame.

263
00:15:57,651 --> 00:16:01,760
That's why a lot of these guys go
nuts because it's 24, seven of them.

264
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,460
So it's going to drive you
nuts if you're not grounded.

265
00:16:04,461 --> 00:16:08,210
Like I won't even live in the hills.
I need to see people,

266
00:16:08,211 --> 00:16:11,720
I need to be like more on the street,
like if I was in Brooklyn, right.

267
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:15,670
Because when you make you, when
you isolate yourself, you know it,

268
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,790
it just makes you just think of you
and like, yeah, look at my house,

269
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:23,180
look at my yard, but I don't see any
people. Right. And that's no good for me.

270
00:16:23,181 --> 00:16:27,350
I got always feel people. Yeah. And that's
also where you come up with material,

271
00:16:27,351 --> 00:16:31,570
cause I hate most people
around them is to,

272
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:36,740
so you, you are around people because
you hate most people. Well I like,

273
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,610
I hate,
you know what I mean about,

274
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:44,090
you know when you get in traffic and you
just make a move and they look at you

275
00:16:44,091 --> 00:16:46,160
like they own the fucking street.
Well you know,

276
00:16:46,161 --> 00:16:50,060
you know if you had to Starbucks and you
take too long to order a fucking coffee,

277
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,260
they're looking at you like,

278
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:54,800
doesn't he know the fucking menu that
I want to fucking club them to death?

279
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:59,350
You know what I mean? Like gimme the
30 so why do I feel panicked? You know,

280
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,620
even at an airport,

281
00:17:00,621 --> 00:17:04,820
why do you have to feel panicked to
put your fucking shoes in a basket that

282
00:17:04,821 --> 00:17:07,460
somebody is looking like
doesn't he know the routine?

283
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:09,710
Why do I got to rush every fucking move?

284
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,930
But that's where our material comes from.

285
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:16,480
And then on stage I blow
it out comedically. But
in real life, like I said,

286
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,740
you want a club day ahead
through to fucking feet,

287
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:22,790
but you like being around them.
You gotta be around them,

288
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:25,430
you gotta be around them to live life.
Yeah,

289
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,790
you have to do definitely do
a certain amount of it. But I,

290
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:29,510
I definitely need decompression too.

291
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,900
You know when I light a cigarette is
Starbucks and I'm sitting outside and they

292
00:17:32,901 --> 00:17:36,690
stopped fucking coughing. You
know, they're stock quote.

293
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:41,720
You ever get up in la about six in the
morning where you can't see the fucking

294
00:17:41,721 --> 00:17:44,510
sky because the fucking dirty smog.

295
00:17:44,511 --> 00:17:48,410
It's feet above your fucking
hedge. True. But my cigarettes,

296
00:17:48,411 --> 00:17:51,940
the one knocking you out. Golf.
Fuck yourselves outside the fuck.

297
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:55,500
Anybody that don't like my cigarette,
fuck you.

298
00:17:55,501 --> 00:17:59,590
And the horse you fucking wrote in. The
only time I really want, I mean, oh no,

299
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,420
it dealt with me enough. They see the
shit. That's true. He does get the looks.

300
00:18:03,421 --> 00:18:06,210
That's great. The cigarette is
like lighting. You would have been,

301
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,840
what do you think about
laws?

302
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,540
They're passing where you can't smoke
outside certain said. You know what?

303
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,780
I'll tell you how I feel about
the fucking lawyer right now.

304
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:19,350
I don't know why I got in this mode
the other night. Like I told you,

305
00:18:19,351 --> 00:18:23,130
I just got done. I was in San Francisco
doing the, a woody Allen movie,

306
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:26,610
which actually Louis C K is.
And also, what is the movie?
Tell us about the movie.

307
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,640
He doesn't like it to heavy role.
Okay.

308
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,030
The heaviest dramatic role I've
ever played in my life. And,

309
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:38,130
and it, you know, doing
scenes with Cate Blanchett,

310
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:42,470
like you standing there going, I can't
believe I'm even working with this.

311
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,290
Like how the fuck did this happen?
They kicked me out of,

312
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:49,500
I got banned from every
studio. That was, you know,

313
00:18:49,501 --> 00:18:54,440
I made sure to just destroy my career.
But she didn't, she didn't know nothing.

314
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,900
But cause you're always funny,
you never really destroyed it.

315
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:01,620
You were always funny, you
know, went through this weird
hiatus where people, uh,

316
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:06,840
just to bring my kids up and who doesn't
like that fuck them because they're not

317
00:19:06,841 --> 00:19:08,340
parents,
you know?

318
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:12,570
But the thing is talking about the
smoking with the night we got done,

319
00:19:12,571 --> 00:19:14,760
me and Max were staying
at the four seasons,

320
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:17,760
went to this four star
restaurant to celebrate,

321
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:20,760
had some like champagne type stuff.

322
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:25,290
And at the end of the meal I
just lit up a cigarette. No,

323
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,160
let us restaurant. And Max
is looking at me, gone, Dad,

324
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:32,190
we're all right. Don't worry.
There's hardly any people.

325
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:36,150
And then the way that comes over, if the
few minutes ago, can you do me a favor?

326
00:19:36,151 --> 00:19:39,090
Get me an ashtray. You know? And
he's looking at, he goes, oh,

327
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:42,180
you can't smoke in here. And I'm
done with it. You know, Shit.

328
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:45,990
Put it on the floor or get a glass
of water. You know what I mean? Yeah.

329
00:19:45,991 --> 00:19:48,870
And it just felt good to have a
cigarette and a restaurant again.

330
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:53,220
Well as a nonsmoker. I going to tell
you that Shit's disgusting restaurant.

331
00:19:53,221 --> 00:19:56,550
It's fucking completely disgusting.
Outside of couldn't get her last. Yeah,

332
00:19:56,551 --> 00:19:58,800
but it sounds like was a big restaurant.
Yeah.

333
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,560
Well outside of wouldn't
like it if there was like,

334
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:03,390
but I've never done in front of my kids.
But you know,

335
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:06,230
I mean it depends on like where you're at.
It's the only place I,

336
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,020
I light up now and then is in a mall.
You know what I mean?

337
00:20:10,021 --> 00:20:14,160
Because I don't feel they should have
that lawyer and nice and people know I

338
00:20:14,161 --> 00:20:16,320
smoked so they should just
leave me the fuck alone.

339
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,670
You well with all these new laws to
be in past, that's probably terrorism.

340
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:22,660
They could probably tase you.
You,

341
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:26,580
you know how all this shit
about yesterday's podcast,

342
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,740
the thing that I've been getting the
most shit about his tasering I said that

343
00:20:29,741 --> 00:20:33,360
some guy runs in the field and fucking
cops are trying to chase a macbook at the

344
00:20:33,361 --> 00:20:36,210
cop could blow his fucking knee out.
You could eat, you could blow a disc.

345
00:20:36,211 --> 00:20:38,550
Try and tackle some dude.
Am I going to in a bit like if you,

346
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,500
if you think it's not
a big deal of tackle,

347
00:20:40,501 --> 00:20:41,730
a dude is trying to get away from you.

348
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:44,820
You never really tackled a dude's trying
to get away from you and not knowing if

349
00:20:44,821 --> 00:20:48,070
that dude has weapons. Joy, you
can break of your body. Okay.

350
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,230
Tasering looks fun. I
still have it hand it. Uh,

351
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:55,120
if you want to run out on the field and
fuck with a game in front of 2 million

352
00:20:55,121 --> 00:20:57,410
people and all the
assholes, you know? Yeah.

353
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:03,210
And it's a safe way to take somebody
down. If you were a cop, sorry, Dick said,

354
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,230
sorry.
Dick.

355
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:08,980
Head to when somebody is trying to break
into his house and a cop tasers them.

356
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:12,820
There'll be thanking his fucking ass.
I don't know who said it, but fuck

357
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:19,380
silly. Cribbing buddy. Let's point
up thing. Go to cop did dish.

358
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:22,450
So just one thing. Yeah. You
be in those neighborhoods and,

359
00:21:22,451 --> 00:21:25,990
and want to have to get home to your kids
that night. You'd do what you gotta do.

360
00:21:25,991 --> 00:21:27,890
That's it. Well, I think
a lot of them have,

361
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,520
so it's a lack of better
than shooting somebody. Yeah.

362
00:21:30,521 --> 00:21:33,550
I think a lot of them have massive
amounts of pressure built up that we can't

363
00:21:33,551 --> 00:21:34,840
even understand as a person.

364
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:38,530
We don't have to deal with violent
crime on every fucking on a daily basis.

365
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:41,320
We don't know what kind of build
up those guys have. And by the way,

366
00:21:41,321 --> 00:21:44,140
I think he should be fucking mandatory.
They should actually learn how to fight.

367
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:48,010
You know, I've met dude's in the work
cops and I met him in Jujitsu class.

368
00:21:48,011 --> 00:21:50,740
I'm like their first day and I'm like,
Holy Shit son,

369
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:53,390
you're a white belt and
you're a cop like you.

370
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:56,300
You better learn how to strangle some
fucking people. Like you're going to,

371
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:58,510
you know, someone might want
to try and take your gun.

372
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:01,780
Do you know that that can happen.
You better learn how to fight, bitch,

373
00:22:01,781 --> 00:22:02,650
are you crazy?

374
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:06,040
You're going to go out there with a gun
and a fucking target and you don't even

375
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:08,510
know how to fight.
And I don't know how much they teach them.

376
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:12,070
I don't know how much it's,
it's a dedicated to hand to hand combat.

377
00:22:12,071 --> 00:22:13,630
But coach should be your whole job.

378
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:16,120
Hand to hand combat and
how to hold on to your gun.

379
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:19,570
That should be like all your training.
Totally the filing. It's true.

380
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,410
But listen man,
I'm just aware

381
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:26,740
motherfuckers out there.

382
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:32,280
Let's talk about show you just did the
theater in a way where you just Denver

383
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:36,790
the paramount theater in Denver. Yeah.
Fucking awesome. And how was that for you?

384
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:40,310
Oh it was, cause I like interviewing
you too. Oh it was amazing. You know,

385
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,610
now you're doing these big theaters,

386
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:46,000
which you know a little from
everything you've been working on.

387
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:51,160
It's all from the [inaudible] know how
great you know this podcast is and what

388
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:52,840
you could do for yourself.
You know,

389
00:22:52,841 --> 00:22:56,230
because my whole thing has always
been about accomplishment in life.

390
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:58,870
And look what you're doing
now. I mean, you know,

391
00:22:58,871 --> 00:23:00,880
five years ago I think
he was still in clubs.

392
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:04,420
Now you're doing these big theaters and
two years ago it was mostly doing club.

393
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:08,620
And that's commendable. I mean you're
doing two, three, 4,000 seaters now.

394
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:11,290
And that's of course it is because
she put in the work and it's,

395
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:13,390
I'm proud of you brother.
Thank you very much.

396
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:17,760
I mean I had done some theaters in the
past besides breaking limbs on cops in

397
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:20,560
between. You go and do concerts
and that's a good thing.

398
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:24,550
I just want to help the cops. No,
I know you though. I know a lot.

399
00:23:24,551 --> 00:23:28,060
A lot of cops in MMA.
I know a lot of cops because of a Jujitsu.

400
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:30,550
So I would like when,
when everybody people shit on cops.

401
00:23:30,551 --> 00:23:33,430
I've always been wanting to defend
cops. That's a, that's a really,

402
00:23:33,431 --> 00:23:36,820
really hard job. You know, I've talked
to people, I've heard horror stories,

403
00:23:36,821 --> 00:23:39,690
Kaiser on the job and they're not
trying to be assholes, but if you,

404
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:44,380
you lived a life where your job all day,
people were lying to you all day.

405
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,580
People align you and try
to get away with shit.

406
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:49,830
That's like most of the time if
you're talking to somebody that you,

407
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:52,880
when I was growing up there with three
things that either want them to be doing

408
00:23:52,881 --> 00:23:57,350
what I'm doing now, a cop or an attorney,
and you know how it changed my mind.

409
00:23:57,351 --> 00:23:58,184
I'm being a cop.

410
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:01,550
When I would take the train in
Brooklyn every day into Manhattan,

411
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:04,850
what pricks people would
just to fucking take a seat.

412
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:07,490
How they would just knock
out of the fucking way. I go,

413
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:10,370
I don't want to protect these
motherfuckers. I want to kill him.

414
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:14,540
You know what I mean? So that changed my
mind on net, you know, and the attorney,

415
00:24:14,541 --> 00:24:19,350
well, let's face it, my schooling just
wasn't up to par, but he's good at,

416
00:24:19,351 --> 00:24:24,210
he's good. Yeah. I could dissect.
I don't fight with him. Hell you,

417
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:28,370
it's horrible. I know how to
break it down like an attorney.

418
00:24:28,371 --> 00:24:30,680
Even when my kids,
when they were really little,

419
00:24:30,681 --> 00:24:34,040
I used to have like an argument and take
them in the living room and I'd sit him

420
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:37,730
down and I go, okay, we're going to
have the trial. There was horrible.

421
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:42,760
Oh remember we remember what the
bathroom in my bedroom in the house dead,

422
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:47,900
Eh, that I led the LRE
stay at? No, no, no,

423
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,620
no, no. A Valerie owner. Alright.
Sometimes I call it valid or,

424
00:24:51,621 --> 00:24:53,660
and she's Ellery gets fucked up.

425
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:58,640
So there was this towel rack in
my bathroom and one day, you know,

426
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:02,200
near the shower I come in and it's broken.
So you know,

427
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:04,850
I got a Mac so I'm going to do and I go,
well who broke the rack?

428
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,720
Nobody's admitting it. So now the
trial has to happen, you know,

429
00:25:08,721 --> 00:25:13,370
and I just break down where they
were, what they were doing. Dylan,

430
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,340
it's still going on the trial.

431
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:20,180
Still going on years later I'm going
to get to the bottom of it and then the

432
00:25:20,181 --> 00:25:24,170
punishment will happen because
I'll break their towel rack.

433
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:27,770
But I liked that Max is staying quiet
about it. He's not, yeah, he's not,

434
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:32,910
he's not ratting on his brother and
he's not well listen, first of all Max,

435
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:36,920
he knows he's got a great roll
the dice man. Like literally,

436
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:39,500
literally you've got a
great roll the dice in life.

437
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:41,870
I mean your father is Andrew dice clay.
That's a fucking,

438
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:44,960
you're already on awesome street
from the jump. Well, you know,

439
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:48,470
what does your dad do?
Oh my dad. Oh, nothing.

440
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:53,910
Andrew dice clay [inaudible] that way
because you can't put it that way because

441
00:25:54,831 --> 00:25:58,670
I always brought them up that I am dead.
You are no look,

442
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:00,860
you are very humble
and you're very normal,

443
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:05,750
but you're still Andrew motherfucking
dice clay and I throw up having Andrew

444
00:26:05,751 --> 00:26:10,550
dice clay as a dad. That's pretty
sweet. You know, that's not, you know,

445
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:15,770
they're preparing. They're
doing the special with me.
That's what, yeah, no roadmap.

446
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:21,000
Do new breath, man. They
did your show in um, in uh,

447
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:25,970
in Vegas they're rehearsing. How great
is the Riviera? Don't you love it?

448
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:30,290
A God damn like it's, it's like a
cultural experience that fucking,

449
00:26:30,291 --> 00:26:32,330
we haven't changed those pictures
on the walls and forever.

450
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:36,050
They have these photos from the river
here from the fifties and sixties and

451
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:38,630
seventies. the 80s. I mean, it's like
a history lesson. It's incredible.

452
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:42,110
When I grade their, that's why
like playing those, hold the hotel.

453
00:26:42,111 --> 00:26:43,910
I love that place so much on it.

454
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:48,060
And the show room still has that
feel of like if you were in there,

455
00:26:48,061 --> 00:26:50,040
they actually shut casino in that hotel.

456
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:52,440
Did they really had the movie
keeps saying, Oh that's right.

457
00:26:52,441 --> 00:26:57,210
You know I stayed in the Casino Room
when, when uh, yeah, Steve Sharp.

458
00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:01,620
He used to stay upstairs in
the two bedroom. I'll put
you in a supernatural room,

459
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:05,820
show you, I got you in the
Sinatra Room. He was like,

460
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:10,920
who's the best? What a fucking great
guy. He was running a the Riviera.

461
00:27:10,921 --> 00:27:13,470
He would do all the comedy from
the river Yarra. He was so fun.

462
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:16,380
I would so look forward to
hanging out with him. But man,

463
00:27:16,381 --> 00:27:19,800
you do not fuck with that guy man.
I've seen that guy snap on people.

464
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:24,240
Holy Shit with some asshole threw his
cigarette on the carpet and sharp.

465
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,790
If a trip is a big fucking guy,
he got them.

466
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:30,830
Hey asshole.
Fuck that fucking bought off.

467
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:35,220
You do this shit in your house in 40
your mother fucking piece of shit.

468
00:27:35,221 --> 00:27:36,054
Pick it up.

469
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,050
Fuck Outta here. Fuck brings
it to, it's a giant guy.

470
00:27:40,051 --> 00:27:43,770
And he brought it to 10 immediately.
You could not be an asshole rusher up.

471
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:44,940
Fuck it.

472
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:48,960
I love people with a short fuse where
you could tell [inaudible] seen some real

473
00:27:48,961 --> 00:27:50,990
live violence, does it? He's a,

474
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,920
he's kicked it up to a level that
lets you know he sees, I mean,

475
00:27:54,921 --> 00:27:57,570
that's not a fakers level.
That's a level of,

476
00:27:57,571 --> 00:27:59,370
he's willing to take it to a dark place,

477
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,210
dark,
dark

478
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:02,230
place.
Right quick.

479
00:28:02,231 --> 00:28:07,231
I know I can always smell dudes who are
just ready to take it to def con four

480
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,900
and Syrup as one of those, you
know, I want to fuck with that guy.

481
00:28:10,901 --> 00:28:14,650
That's no bullshit. He's a great guy
though. I never had a problem with them.

482
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:18,220
I always love talking to him. He's such
a fun guy, but he's a hilarious guy.

483
00:28:18,221 --> 00:28:21,940
He could easily done stand up. He's
doing it now. He should be doing it.

484
00:28:21,941 --> 00:28:25,180
He's kicking it. Easily been doing
it. I tell him, look, you know,

485
00:28:25,181 --> 00:28:29,570
I had this great talk with sure ripple
when he was on soprano's. Like you know,

486
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:33,040
almost like the talk we had years ago.
Only about like,

487
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:37,600
why aren't you setting yourself up for
like an ABC Sitcom? He was perfect for it,

488
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:41,230
right? Like to play a father and
now, oh no, it's telling me, well,

489
00:28:41,231 --> 00:28:45,850
he's first doing it now.
Now he's doing a lot.

490
00:28:45,851 --> 00:28:49,360
Because I thought he was, you know, even
though he played a gangster and Sopranos,

491
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:53,290
you could see he's not a gangster. You
could see he could be a regular nice guy.

492
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:56,980
He played, the guy that he
played was like really demure.

493
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,940
Much different than him as a person.
He's a really good actor for playing.

494
00:29:00,941 --> 00:29:04,060
The tambourine didn't do standup to
like told them when we did a print this,

495
00:29:04,061 --> 00:29:07,540
I go, so you're going to hit the road.
I figured he did stand up. He goes,

496
00:29:07,541 --> 00:29:10,570
I don't do standup. I go, what the
fuck are you doing on the show then?

497
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,820
You know what I mean? What
are you doing? What are you,

498
00:29:12,821 --> 00:29:14,020
what are you trying for here?

499
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:18,100
And then he started to stand up right
after that he started and never came home.

500
00:29:18,101 --> 00:29:22,390
We're scared to stand up, some of you
know what I mean? I gotta be honest.

501
00:29:22,391 --> 00:29:25,420
I'm a week away from shooting
this special and I know,

502
00:29:25,421 --> 00:29:30,040
I know my shit down pat now, but you
start thinking, do I really know it?

503
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:33,700
Because once you're out there, you're
alone. It's you and the audience.

504
00:29:33,701 --> 00:29:35,950
And that's what we want to show.
Or two shows for the films.

505
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:39,070
I'm going to tape two shows.
I really only wanted to do one,

506
00:29:39,071 --> 00:29:42,100
but showtime wants them to
do the too because I'd rather

507
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:45,330
have my back against the wall and
have to come out swinging. Yeah.

508
00:29:45,331 --> 00:29:48,580
Because I feel like I've been a fight
awaiting in the cage to go fight.

509
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:49,661
You know what I mean?

510
00:29:49,661 --> 00:29:54,340
This is two years in the
making the special and it
is a New Year's eve special.

511
00:29:54,341 --> 00:29:58,330
And you know, I should say where I'm
doing it. We're doing it in a Chicago.

512
00:29:58,331 --> 00:30:02,340
What's the theater with the Arcadia
theater to theater. It's our sale now.

513
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:07,210
A theater. And it's actually going
to be my last special, you know,

514
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:10,930
and not because I'm an old man.
I'm going to tor and I, you know,

515
00:30:10,931 --> 00:30:15,280
I got other plans for movies and
I got a book coming out by uh,

516
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:19,470
not this year. They, they like
into the early part of next year.

517
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,160
So there's a lot I got to do.

518
00:30:21,161 --> 00:30:26,161
So I just want to really do one more
special that I feel I really all myself,

519
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:27,341
you know,

520
00:30:27,341 --> 00:30:32,290
and fans and really just fucking bang
them over the head with this shit and you

521
00:30:32,291 --> 00:30:34,750
know, just go out a winner.
Can I make a prediction?

522
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:38,610
I'm going to make a
prediction, right? You,

523
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:43,540
the special that you're
doing this upcoming special
in Chicago at the arcade at

524
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:48,541
theater will create the resurgence that
will make it impossible for you to not

525
00:30:49,601 --> 00:30:50,470
do another special.

526
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:54,850
People realize how funny what you're
doing is when people realize like it,

527
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:59,860
when people are starting to like remember
how fucking funny and hilarious some

528
00:31:00,841 --> 00:31:04,070
of your shit was and when we went to
see that special or it won't do what

529
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:06,600
whatever you did,
what version of what I'm working on,

530
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:11,490
that version is going to kick
people's Dick, right? Dirt Shit was,

531
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:16,060
well, I talked about my respect
for you as a comic because you're,

532
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,790
you're in that, that thing that I'm
in the kind of comedy you've done,

533
00:31:19,791 --> 00:31:21,230
whatever we call out genre,

534
00:31:21,231 --> 00:31:25,190
whatever the fuck it is
now when you say it to me,

535
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:28,280
I believe you. Oh, you know what I mean?

536
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:33,320
I'm telling you the things you're doing
and what I'm doing. We've got a team up.

537
00:31:33,321 --> 00:31:36,860
We got to do some shows. Love to do
you know what I mean? Just me and you.

538
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:40,520
When I was in open miker dude,
I used to listen to your cassette,

539
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:42,230
your cassette in my fucking car.

540
00:31:42,231 --> 00:31:44,510
I would listen to it all the
way to gigs and I told her,

541
00:31:44,511 --> 00:31:45,590
I'll never forget this guy,

542
00:31:45,591 --> 00:31:50,150
Mike Donovan in the back of the
comedy connection in Boston, crying,

543
00:31:50,151 --> 00:31:54,590
laughing, tears coming down his eyes,
crying, laughing, listening to your,

544
00:31:54,591 --> 00:31:56,810
the day the laughter died
during your impression,

545
00:31:57,170 --> 00:32:01,760
your impression of a doing Nixon in a
girl's ass and he's crying and laughing

546
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,050
and I, I'll never forget that. I'll
never forget that. That was to me,

547
00:32:06,051 --> 00:32:08,120
like as a an up and coming comedian.

548
00:32:08,121 --> 00:32:11,780
I was just like starting on and I was
like listening to this like established

549
00:32:11,781 --> 00:32:14,390
Boston comedian just laughing.
He was going,

550
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:21,040
it was fucking crying. Tears were coming
down his eyes. It was so silly to him. It

551
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,290
was so, well, the thing is
you have that effect too.

552
00:32:23,291 --> 00:32:25,870
And that's why we'd be great together.
And it's funny,

553
00:32:25,871 --> 00:32:29,650
anytime I want to do shows with another,
what we'd call headline as scars,

554
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:34,630
it's always hard because of like egos
who goes on if the hoe. And I'm like,

555
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:35,290
you know,

556
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:38,140
just like we talked about fighting
list time that you'd be the only guy in

557
00:32:38,141 --> 00:32:42,080
comedy. I wouldn't want to fight because
there's no way to walk away a winner in

558
00:32:42,081 --> 00:32:46,010
something like that. No, I wouldn't fight
him. You know what I mean? Throw. I mean,

559
00:32:46,011 --> 00:32:50,000
if I had to, I mean if you
push the buttons, I don't
know. It'd be like a wild cat.

560
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:53,720
Nobody's going home saying I didn't
get hurt. You know what I mean?

561
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:58,330
So he's that guy. So it would be the same
thing if we were working together. Like,

562
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:01,010
he would be the only guy that I'm going,
you know what,

563
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:03,170
if he's got to close the show,

564
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:07,640
let him close to show because
he was a fucking animal.
You know what I mean? It's,

565
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:10,510
you know, most comics can't
go on after me, you know,

566
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:14,390
so I don't even know how it would
work, but either way, any way.

567
00:33:14,391 --> 00:33:16,910
And I would be honored. It
would be so fun. I wouldn't,

568
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:21,270
but I'm saying I want to go on if the
you, because you really, you know,

569
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:23,480
when you get that first shot at the crowd,

570
00:33:23,481 --> 00:33:26,000
it's like you don't have the
pressure to close the show.

571
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:30,570
That happened when I did a show with
that fucking, uh, Bill Mod, this asshole

572
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:36,050
that, that, you know, and, and I
wanted to do to shut, this is the last,

573
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:40,490
the last time, you know, I did all the,
you know, what happened? 300 arena shows.

574
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:45,380
No, I'm going to tell you what happened.
I did over 300 arena shows, right?

575
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:49,130
This is before computers does,
before it hit hard ticket sales.

576
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:54,260
So in 2000 when I was going
back to the garden, you know,

577
00:33:54,261 --> 00:33:56,450
I was thinking,
who could open that show for me?

578
00:33:56,780 --> 00:34:00,530
And I saw a special from Bill Maher
when he does his regular stand up,

579
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:04,250
he's a filthy dirty pig
like I am on stage. Okay.

580
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:08,570
So I called bill and I say, you know
what? You've always been great with me.

581
00:34:08,571 --> 00:34:10,100
You know, when, uh, you
know, when I come on,

582
00:34:10,101 --> 00:34:14,780
you're politically incorrect show with
whether it was on MTV or ABC or whenever

583
00:34:14,781 --> 00:34:18,590
he did it, I would always do it. And it
was great. So I said, so why don't you do,

584
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:21,770
I went back to the garden in 2000. I
said, why don't you do the garden with me?

585
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:25,510
And he goes, well, I'm not
an opening act. I call,

586
00:34:25,511 --> 00:34:29,450
I'm not calling you was an opening act.
I go, I'm calling, we'll co headline,

587
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:34,550
everything's equal. And the bottom line,
he was afraid to do it, I could tell.

588
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,100
And so we decided, I said, well,

589
00:34:37,101 --> 00:34:41,150
go somewhere else in the country and
see how it works. So we pick a Phoenix,

590
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:44,600
the celebrity theatre in Phoenix. So
I'm going to close the show, right?

591
00:34:44,601 --> 00:34:45,950
Jim Norton's going to open it.

592
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:49,880
I'm going to go on at the end and bill
and bill will go on if the Norton,

593
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:54,320
so two days before the show,
my agent calls me up and he's like,

594
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:58,370
I got a call from his people
saying he wants to close the show.

595
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:02,840
And I just said, you know what?
That's up to him. I don't care. I go,

596
00:35:02,841 --> 00:35:05,960
all these fucking guys are the
same. It's unbelievable. I go,

597
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:10,050
if he wants to go on after me,
let him go on estimate. No,

598
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:12,770
I'm going to tell you what happened.
So tonight is show,

599
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:16,610
you know I'm already on stage.
You know,

600
00:35:16,611 --> 00:35:18,890
cause Norton went up and
now like I'm telling you,

601
00:35:18,891 --> 00:35:22,430
I feel no pressure to close the show.
So I do to kind of puff.

602
00:35:22,431 --> 00:35:24,140
I go fucking nuts.

603
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:29,830
And Bill actually shows up as I'm doing
the show and he sees this crowd going

604
00:35:30,621 --> 00:35:34,640
fucking ballistic.
So now it's time for him to go on.

605
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:38,160
And you know,
he sets up the stage.

606
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,080
He said,
it's up on the stage,

607
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:44,130
a music stand with
cardboard notes of his act.

608
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:47,790
So now he's brought on stage,
he's brought on stage,

609
00:35:47,791 --> 00:35:52,140
I'm behind the curtain watching,
and he freezes. I mean,

610
00:35:52,141 --> 00:35:56,550
really freezes. He doesn't talk. And I'm
back there. I'm fucking say something,

611
00:35:56,910 --> 00:35:57,780
you know, like, um,

612
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:03,650
he gets booed off the stage and for
fucking minutes now he's in his dressing

613
00:36:03,721 --> 00:36:06,240
room doing whatever he's
doing to relax himself.

614
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:10,380
And he got on stage for four
minutes, four minutes, it comes off.

615
00:36:10,381 --> 00:36:12,720
But now to promote it comes, he goes,
I don't want to give money back.

616
00:36:12,721 --> 00:36:16,590
We gotta get this guy back on stage.
So I go in the dressing room,

617
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:21,720
I'm talking to him as he's doing
whatever he's doing. And I said,

618
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:24,270
Bill, you know, it's rock
and roll comedy, man.

619
00:36:24,271 --> 00:36:27,960
Just go out there and he starts going
up the steps and you start screaming,

620
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:32,490
I'm a fucking monologist. And I
want to look at them and go, well,

621
00:36:32,491 --> 00:36:35,850
what the fuck am I? Because
I'm in a leather. I'm not
a monologist. Yeah, right.

622
00:36:35,851 --> 00:36:38,920
You know,
so he goes on and maybe a third,

623
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:44,360
maybe a third of the crowd is left.
Right, right. And this asshole,

624
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:46,080
if the every joke,
they're like,

625
00:36:46,081 --> 00:36:50,720
the audience is taking potshots
at you fucking suck ass hole.

626
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:53,820
And then you see him run to
the camera that he was filming.

627
00:36:53,821 --> 00:36:58,140
It's set to get the tape. I would
have loved to have that fucking tape.

628
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:03,570
And after the show is making all the
excuses, and I want to say, asshole,

629
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:08,760
why on earth would you ever want to
follow a guy that gets done the fucking

630
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:13,470
Rosebowl?
You're not that kind of fucking performer.

631
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,190
But I let him walk in the hug because
he was fucking frazzled and he was just

632
00:37:17,191 --> 00:37:20,790
trying to save face, you know?
But he's a fucking terrible,

633
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:24,810
that's a terrible idea for when I see
him on his show with the politically

634
00:37:24,811 --> 00:37:28,740
incorrect, I look at him like, yeah,
we really know who you are, don't we?

635
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:33,040
That's how I look at this guy, right?
Like you've got no fucking chops.

636
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:37,590
You just got no fucking chops and
listen. But see, I would do a show with,

637
00:37:37,591 --> 00:37:39,630
you know when you're going in front of me,
no one,

638
00:37:39,631 --> 00:37:43,370
you're going to fucking kill him
because that just brings me up. Yeah.

639
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:47,610
Now I got to write. It's just like
doing this movie. Come on. This movie,

640
00:37:47,611 --> 00:37:51,760
I'm up against Alec Baldwin,
Cate Blanchett, Sally Hawkins.

641
00:37:51,761 --> 00:37:56,340
These are fucking academy nominees,
Golden Globe winners, and I'm gone.

642
00:37:56,370 --> 00:38:00,360
You're just going to have to rise to the
fucking occasion. The better the actor,

643
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:02,940
the better. My work is going to
be. The same thing with the better.

644
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:08,150
Like Norton was probably the best opening
act they ever had as a guy because I

645
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:11,730
will say Eleanor to me is the best
female standup in the country.

646
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:13,800
She just needs that exposure now.

647
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:19,130
But Norton would come on and fucking
slayed the crowd every time and he's

648
00:38:19,611 --> 00:38:21,360
brought all fucking day long.

649
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:25,880
He's the only show I went to over the
last four years to just sit and got her to

650
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:29,700
show and watch him work and I sat
to two shows and he was just great.

651
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,570
I'm an Austin. He was fucking
phenomenal. He's a great, great,

652
00:38:33,571 --> 00:38:36,190
he's one of the great comics up today.
You know what I mean?

653
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:37,870
And so again,

654
00:38:37,871 --> 00:38:42,871
it's the same sort of ridiculous fucking
overexaggerated hilarious kind of

655
00:38:44,091 --> 00:38:49,070
standup comedy. Very, very dirty,
very out there. But you know, it's,

656
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:50,920
it's a fucking legitimate art form.

657
00:38:50,921 --> 00:38:55,360
It really pisses me off when guys like
you or guys like Norton or anybody who

658
00:38:55,361 --> 00:38:58,210
does something that's particularly
dirty or crafts, whatever,

659
00:38:58,390 --> 00:39:01,570
then it doesn't get as as much respect.
It's so stupid.

660
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:06,610
Well No, this is my point. They're
denying that it's hilarious.

661
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:09,760
They're trying to pretend like,
well the other way is harder to do,

662
00:39:09,761 --> 00:39:11,500
so it's better.
Well that's not true.

663
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:14,920
Just because it's harder to make something
clean and clever doesn't mean it's

664
00:39:14,921 --> 00:39:18,130
better cause they're all
stuff makes me laugh.

665
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:21,460
It doesn't mean I don't have intellectual
interim Italians when it comes to

666
00:39:21,461 --> 00:39:26,310
comedy. That shit is a legitimate
fuck art form. I was just at a,

667
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,240
you know, like I said, I've
been going all over the country,

668
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:31,330
prepare on the special service,
just the governors and you know,

669
00:39:31,331 --> 00:39:33,760
go and you've been there,
have a town. Everybody's been,

670
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:38,290
but everybody's been great club. So after
the show, the own is a mark and James,

671
00:39:38,291 --> 00:39:39,124
they say to me,

672
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:43,390
we voted you tonight the biggest
lifts that ever happened in this room.

673
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:48,040
So I don't care how dirty, clean, the
biggest laughs that ever happened.

674
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:50,240
That's what,
and that's the bottom line laughing.

675
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,870
And let me tell you something
about 30 units not so dirty when,

676
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:56,710
when you're talking about
everything that goes on in life,

677
00:39:56,980 --> 00:40:00,310
in a comedic cartoonish,
wet. Yeah. You know,

678
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:04,820
I mean Eleanor became great because
she's facing the hardest crowds to face.

679
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:08,500
Right. I would think your crowds and
the other hardest crowds to face,

680
00:40:08,501 --> 00:40:11,500
you have animal audiences,
real people,

681
00:40:11,501 --> 00:40:16,220
blue collar people come in to see you
perform and they will. Yeah. Right.

682
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:20,410
Yeah. I mean the first time she worked
a Westbury with me, she got booed off.

683
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:25,420
No, because, because what, what I admired
about it and she was really green.

684
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:28,150
This is shut up.
Shut your mouth.

685
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:32,800
I am trying to say
something nice about you.

686
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:35,050
I am defending.
So,

687
00:40:35,051 --> 00:40:39,310
but the fact that she was doing comedy
three months and had the balls to face

688
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:44,311
that fucking crowd was where I gave her
the respect and now she goes out and she

689
00:40:44,801 --> 00:40:48,970
just slays the crab because they'd been
the hardest crowds. It's the, it's,

690
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,790
it's like basic training
when you open for me.

691
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:57,910
So I could imagine. Well, you know
what's funny because of the podcast,

692
00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:01,840
all the people that work with me on the
road or all my friends from the podcast,

693
00:41:01,841 --> 00:41:06,470
it's all Joey Diaz and Ari Shaffir
and Duncan Trussell and Brendan Walsh,

694
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:11,890
the fucking puppet, the
puppet, Little Hobo. Ha Fun.

695
00:41:11,891 --> 00:41:15,480
When he does that thing with the
thing and they say like, thanks Lloyd,

696
00:41:15,481 --> 00:41:18,820
was she with the fucking Prass
genius one night he did it.

697
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,240
I want you to fucking throw him such a
beating because he didn't put his heart

698
00:41:22,241 --> 00:41:25,150
into it. And I sacked it
through the whole fucking act,

699
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,400
waiting for the puppet
to turn into the devil,

700
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:30,940
whatever with the prayer and see
people running from the show.

701
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:34,190
And he didn't do it the way I wanted.
And I was like,

702
00:41:34,191 --> 00:41:37,720
I fucking told you fucking rare.

703
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,560
I'm going to sit in a room and watch you.
I want to see the prayer,

704
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:43,760
the prayer kit.

705
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:48,020
I think my whole act down or going
on stage at you in the morning,

706
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:52,730
two in the fucking morning.
People are sleeping on the fucking table.

707
00:41:52,731 --> 00:41:56,090
That's right. That's how you,
I even tell him Max that I go,

708
00:41:56,091 --> 00:42:00,770
when you play these places like Marty's
and there's five people who gives a fuck

709
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:05,120
about and segment, just work your bits.
Because if he could work the silence,

710
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:08,390
the land,
I'm going to be me and Kennison.

711
00:42:08,391 --> 00:42:12,740
We're on every night back to back
between one and two in the morning.

712
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:17,510
We were the last two this before you
ever came out to la and the crowd would,

713
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:21,440
whoever was there walked out knowing
they saw something special. You know,

714
00:42:21,441 --> 00:42:23,330
it wasn't just one after the other.
Well,

715
00:42:23,331 --> 00:42:25,570
my parents who gives a fuck if they limit,

716
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:32,930
you know, no real fucking like my son
Max when he's putting bits together.

717
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:37,220
You know, I say certain things when
I do on stage are very like you know,

718
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:40,910
out there and it's just for the effect
of making them laugh and other things

719
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:45,740
like when I talk about these
new generation pigs and how
they are, you know, the,

720
00:42:45,741 --> 00:42:49,100
the, the generation that you know,
years ago, like I, I'd always,

721
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:53,760
I always knew what slobs women were
in bed right on north. Yeah. Cause he,

722
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:58,850
he or she is, you know,
but, but you, but you know,

723
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:03,470
you know, 20 years ago they didn't want
to admit to the pigs that they are today.

724
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:08,330
There is so aggressive. It's so much
material to talk about on stage.

725
00:43:08,331 --> 00:43:12,200
Like when I get a friend calling me and
go and so I went out with this girl,

726
00:43:12,201 --> 00:43:15,740
I wind the doing everything to
her that when I banged her rash,

727
00:43:15,741 --> 00:43:20,540
she looked at me and said, I used to
be really good at this unthinking,

728
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:24,830
what? Take it to Jiffy Lube. You know
what I mean? The guy was like, nope,

729
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:29,900
because a girl 20 years ago would
never look back at you and say,

730
00:43:29,901 --> 00:43:34,250
I used to be good at this,
taking in no at anything.

731
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:38,390
They would just, if they even did that,
they wouldn't even talk about it today.

732
00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:42,980
They're almost giving you
a fucking checklist of what
they will and won't do and

733
00:43:42,981 --> 00:43:43,814
you feel,

734
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:48,020
you feel like the chick that the next
day after you've done everything to them,

735
00:43:48,021 --> 00:43:49,910
my friends go.
So I called the girl,

736
00:43:49,911 --> 00:43:53,330
you know the the call to like say
how you doing today and she's gone,

737
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:56,690
I'll call you back in a few.
And it's been three fucking days.

738
00:43:56,930 --> 00:43:59,840
Like she did everything and
couldn't care less about it.

739
00:43:59,841 --> 00:44:02,480
That sounds like a dude who
didn't fuck her correctly. No, no.

740
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:06,950
Let me tell you something. I
went proper. Let me tell you.

741
00:44:06,951 --> 00:44:11,600
So I went to a fucking ton of them between
now and orange and Valerie, you know,

742
00:44:11,601 --> 00:44:14,930
just one after the other
load if the fucking load,

743
00:44:14,931 --> 00:44:19,460
I'm not even doing material in
between Illinois and meeting my wife.

744
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:22,460
It was a revolving door,
you know,

745
00:44:22,850 --> 00:44:27,430
get even Max nearly got the bang
one of them, you know, which which,

746
00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:32,070
which was ridiculous. And
um, I set him up with some

747
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:34,440
people. It was good. No
but, but what I'm saying is,

748
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:39,470
so I saw what was out there
and, and it's like, you know,

749
00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:42,810
they really do that.
I don't care how good you are in bed.

750
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:46,300
A girl could just bang a guy
and the next day forget it.

751
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:50,040
You used to do have a one night stand.
That's how they look at it now.

752
00:44:50,070 --> 00:44:54,680
It's definitely a different world.
Oh my God, please. It's a different,

753
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:57,960
the age of information because of the
fact that they can get on their phone and

754
00:44:57,961 --> 00:45:01,170
watch them and taking the house.
You can't stop them.

755
00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:04,980
They grew up on fucking
us today at 19 feel.

756
00:45:04,981 --> 00:45:07,980
If they didn't post a picture of diarrhea.
So lips on the Internet,

757
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:13,000
they're not as hip as deaf fucking
girlfriends all it's true to say,

758
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:15,450
you know how they say like beams profile,
you know,

759
00:45:15,451 --> 00:45:20,070
how did he say being 40 years old profile
picture will be being 40 years old is

760
00:45:20,071 --> 00:45:23,360
like the new 30. I think. Anybody
who says that's an ass no,

761
00:45:23,370 --> 00:45:26,130
but you know how they do that?
Like green is the new blue.

762
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,990
The asshole has become the new bushing.

763
00:45:30,370 --> 00:45:33,790
It's to no fucking pussy. It's like,
come on, wait, what happened to the blue?

764
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:38,820
They blow it out of control. I guess
people don't blow it out of control. Joey,

765
00:45:38,821 --> 00:45:42,480
they blow it out if they want to fuck.
And then I want to get anybody pregnant.

766
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:47,670
It's too bad there's not an extra vagina.
And so like you have a baby,

767
00:45:47,671 --> 00:45:50,300
make it vagina and then uh,
you know,

768
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:55,170
the asshole when we would just leave
it alone, but we wouldn't even live in

769
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:07,440
fucking Vegas. Now.

770
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:11,640
What'd you say? Ellen was going to
be opening in the show in Chicago.

771
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:15,210
We to talk coping,
very excited about it.

772
00:46:15,330 --> 00:46:20,330
And the band's going to be opening up
to show also in a Chicago kicks that

773
00:46:20,791 --> 00:46:25,740
Baritone a couple of notches when he gets
on the mic. La Rock, we got presence.

774
00:46:25,770 --> 00:46:27,720
We just picked up the drum skin,
right?

775
00:46:27,970 --> 00:46:32,340
I've just got the drums first official
La rock think it's so cool that you have

776
00:46:32,341 --> 00:46:35,700
the show where you, you know, it's like
you're traveling with family, you know,

777
00:46:35,701 --> 00:46:38,550
and I think that's a really
important aspect of the road.

778
00:46:38,551 --> 00:46:40,560
And that's one of the things
that's made it big for me.

779
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:42,150
I said when I do these shows,

780
00:46:42,151 --> 00:46:45,840
like with Joey Diaz or Duncan Trussell
where these guys are my family,

781
00:46:45,841 --> 00:46:49,290
they're my friends. We've been friends
for a decade plus and we always will be.

782
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:53,630
So when we go on the road together,
it's just, it's your thing. Yeah,

783
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:57,400
we're all real really Eleanor.

784
00:46:58,560 --> 00:46:59,990
I mean, how long do I know, you know,

785
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:10,410
Eleanor was the finest waitress ever at
the comedy store and everybody tried to

786
00:47:10,411 --> 00:47:10,741
talk to you.

787
00:47:10,741 --> 00:47:13,650
I don't know if I tried to talk you into
doing something that I'm sure everybody

788
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:16,890
does show. I was engaged to
this fucking girl, right?

789
00:47:22,630 --> 00:47:25,520
Paula Brown.
Oh,

790
00:47:25,570 --> 00:47:30,100
why Tolo why this is what happens,
right. We break up were broken up for six

791
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:34,270
weeks. Right now I get
the call because, because,

792
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:38,920
because I was having all these fights
at the comedy store for like about six,

793
00:47:38,921 --> 00:47:40,060
seven months. I was got, you know,

794
00:47:40,061 --> 00:47:44,380
it was under a lot of pressure from the
ex wife with the kids and everything

795
00:47:44,381 --> 00:47:49,120
going on. So somebody fucked with me. I
would get physical, you know, it came,

796
00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:52,080
that was one time I was kicking this
guy's head in the front of the store,

797
00:47:52,090 --> 00:47:53,290
the cops.
It was crazy.

798
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:58,090
So now I'm fucking damn I rarer and no,

799
00:47:58,091 --> 00:48:01,780
it's shut up. See what I
mean? She goes, hey guys. Had
like a confrontation. No, no.

800
00:48:01,781 --> 00:48:05,890
But Dom has always been, you know, since
since the day I took off, it was always,

801
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:09,370
and I love dom as a comic. He's a
great, he's one of the great comics,

802
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:14,620
but he would always bring up debt. I'm
Jewish, like, like, like, like a Jew camp.

803
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:18,760
Be Good looking from Brooklyn and have
a fucking attitude if he's not Italian,

804
00:48:18,761 --> 00:48:22,600
right? So he would go on radio
shows and say my last name, like,

805
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:27,550
no, I'm telling you what happened. But
Ellen was really great friends with dumb,

806
00:48:27,551 --> 00:48:30,610
which is fine. But now
one night, you know,

807
00:48:30,611 --> 00:48:34,030
I've had a couple of things happen with
dom where he did this jute thing and I'd

808
00:48:34,031 --> 00:48:37,850
have to get in his face, just straightened
them out, but without violence. Right?

809
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:41,770
So now a couple of years goes
by. Now I'm on stage in the, uh,

810
00:48:41,890 --> 00:48:46,060
original room just working on material
on a Monday night and not on for more

811
00:48:46,061 --> 00:48:47,140
than 15 minutes.

812
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:52,440
And he had comes a dom and I want
to make fun of them and he's gone,

813
00:48:52,871 --> 00:48:56,140
when are you going to be done? He's
interrupting me now. And you know what?

814
00:48:56,170 --> 00:48:58,240
You don't interrupt somebody
that's done what I've done.

815
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,520
We're not if the comedy
factory outlet anymore,

816
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:03,880
you're not even in my fucking league.
You know what I mean? And he's gone.

817
00:49:03,881 --> 00:49:06,900
When you get a Goddamn, do yourself
a favor. Get out of the room.

818
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:11,290
I'm trying to help you here. Just get
the fuck. And he keeps going. And I said,

819
00:49:11,291 --> 00:49:14,410
you know what, you want me to come off
stage. I'm coming off the fucking stage.

820
00:49:14,590 --> 00:49:19,120
And I'd come after him and I get them at
the front booth that a comedy store and

821
00:49:19,121 --> 00:49:24,121
he makes the mistake of touching me and
I slam him against the wall is his head

822
00:49:25,451 --> 00:49:28,510
breaks a fucking one of the
eight by tens on the wall.

823
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:31,620
And I'm going to bash his
face in, but our, but our,

824
00:49:31,621 --> 00:49:33,900
he jumps on me and Steve Reynolds easy.

825
00:49:33,901 --> 00:49:38,901
John saw me and Steve Simone jumps on me
and then this fucking asshole wants to

826
00:49:39,491 --> 00:49:41,800
walk by me and go,
I'm funnier than you.

827
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:45,610
So now I got to grab him by the back of
his jacket. I pull him back. I'm like,

828
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:49,900
why the fuck would you even put
yourself in the same league with me?

829
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:53,020
You're a fucking club hack.
That's all you are.

830
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:57,530
I played the biggest fucking places in
the world. Get the fuck out of this place.

831
00:49:57,531 --> 00:49:59,200
I drawn down the steps,
right?

832
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:03,730
Well now I'm in the back and I'm actually
angry at her because she has broken up

833
00:50:03,731 --> 00:50:08,440
about five fights at the time. And his
store, he's Steve Simone, let me finish.

834
00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:13,120
Let me finish. So Steve Simone,
I go, where the fuck was Eleanor?

835
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:15,550
Cause I can't lift my hands to anybody.
If he didn't touch me,

836
00:50:15,551 --> 00:50:18,430
I couldn't have done anything.
So she goes,

837
00:50:18,431 --> 00:50:23,080
she said let them work it out themselves.
I'm telling you what the fuck.

838
00:50:23,081 --> 00:50:26,260
He said, tell you what.
All right, so, so now,

839
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:31,370
so the next morning, me and Eleanor
have the fight over this. So you know,

840
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:35,210
she leaves, slams the door, we're
broken up. Six weeks goes by.

841
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:40,220
Now she calls me and says,
I'm moving to New York. Okay.

842
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:45,520
So I'm actually going to pick up Dylan
who's doing Hebrew lessons and me and Max

843
00:50:45,951 --> 00:50:48,350
it talking about. And I go, all
right, we can't let her leave.

844
00:50:48,790 --> 00:50:52,160
So I got into comedy story, so let's
get married. Let's just get married,

845
00:50:52,161 --> 00:50:55,760
forget the fight. You know what I mean?
So we, you know, we do like an instant,

846
00:50:55,790 --> 00:50:58,640
you know, engagement, you know, and a,

847
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:01,970
and d and that's how we got engaged.

848
00:51:02,330 --> 00:51:06,710
Well, you, you pull your picking
up. We already sticking up for dom.

849
00:51:06,711 --> 00:51:09,980
That's why I always mean
when you go in with a girl,

850
00:51:09,981 --> 00:51:13,520
every comic in the world was calling her.
That's not what it's about. I go, look,

851
00:51:13,550 --> 00:51:18,080
I'm the fucking guy. I don't give a fuck
about dom. He's nice guys, a good comic.

852
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:21,740
But when it comes to anything
between me and your weird, a couple,

853
00:51:21,741 --> 00:51:26,210
I'm the one on top of you pump
mulloway every night. That's dumb.

854
00:51:26,211 --> 00:51:27,830
You're not looking at a it,

855
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:33,800
it had a lot to do with this Mac
wait time. Yes ma'am. Why do you,

856
00:51:33,801 --> 00:51:35,070
why are you so hello?

857
00:51:37,490 --> 00:51:40,400
Let us fight this out because
he started, no, first of all,

858
00:51:40,490 --> 00:51:44,870
it has nothing to do that
fucking special personal shit.

859
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:49,610
And so it was, it was affecting every
night, every store. And so when I quit,

860
00:51:49,611 --> 00:51:52,300
I thought that would be better.
And then we did live together for you,

861
00:51:52,310 --> 00:51:55,470
but didn't work out our engagements.
Fine. I'm your sister wife now. No,

862
00:51:55,490 --> 00:51:59,780
she's the greatest girl in the
world. Why? Yeah. That's so bizarre.

863
00:51:59,830 --> 00:52:02,050
But one of the greatest guys in the world,
he was just literally,

864
00:52:02,070 --> 00:52:03,020
and he truly didn't know that.

865
00:52:03,021 --> 00:52:06,030
That's a bizarre scenario that I
went out with him. First of all,

866
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:09,860
please Oprah Click move on dice,

867
00:52:10,930 --> 00:52:13,440
because it's not easy to score
the captain of the cheerleading.

868
00:52:15,070 --> 00:52:17,880
I always thought Illinois was a nice guy.
I never made moves towards a,

869
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:21,040
and when I actually started
coming on to her all,

870
00:52:21,041 --> 00:52:25,630
she knew I was happily married with
two kids. No, she actually was,

871
00:52:25,690 --> 00:52:29,320
was babysitting my kids in
Vegas when they were like, no,

872
00:52:29,321 --> 00:52:32,870
but how old were they at the time? Dylan
was how old? Almost like too. I too.

873
00:52:32,871 --> 00:52:37,090
I was like six. So Max is sick.
Yeah. You know, so I mean, you know,

874
00:52:37,091 --> 00:52:41,860
I would do anything in the world fell in
or w we off family. I do know. And uh,

875
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:43,390
but,
but that's how it came down.

876
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:47,530
So I was just aggravated that at of all
the arguments and fights I was getting

877
00:52:47,531 --> 00:52:52,520
at and the comedy store, she didn't
come back me up on the I rarefied. Yes.

878
00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:55,960
Everyone wasn't against Tom, you
know, because damn did have the balls.

879
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:59,410
I gotta I gotta I got a lot of
respect from because after the fight,

880
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:04,510
all of a sudden he comes dumb into the
kitchen and I'm standing next to Ellen on

881
00:53:04,511 --> 00:53:07,620
now and I'm coming down from the
whole thing and it goes dice,

882
00:53:07,630 --> 00:53:09,490
I want to talk to you. And I'm like, damn,

883
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:14,390
it's the biggest mistake you can make
coming near me now. And he kept coming in.

884
00:53:14,391 --> 00:53:17,680
In my mind I'm going, if this guy has
the guts to get within arms reach,

885
00:53:17,890 --> 00:53:20,060
I'm going to talk to them.
And then we spot, you know,

886
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:23,470
we talked about for two hours and you
know, and we haven't talked since.

887
00:53:23,471 --> 00:53:27,840
But anyway, it's all good. I love
both of you and can I love dom,

888
00:53:27,841 --> 00:53:30,570
I railroad like a brother.
No dumb. You know, I, I,

889
00:53:30,571 --> 00:53:33,930
dom can be a little hostile though
on occasion if especially if he feels

890
00:53:33,931 --> 00:53:37,620
disrespected. And let me tell
you something. If dom was
a different way, you know,

891
00:53:37,621 --> 00:53:41,100
we were on the same special
with Rodney c w with dom.

892
00:53:41,101 --> 00:53:44,640
I got a history with dom because when I
used to do Philly as a struggling comic,

893
00:53:44,970 --> 00:53:49,320
I would always headline the comedy
factory outlet. And Dom is from Philly.

894
00:53:49,321 --> 00:53:50,160
I was from Brooklyn,

895
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:54,660
so a clay here who owned the club would
it book dom a lot of times to open the

896
00:53:54,661 --> 00:53:58,920
show for me. So all the way
from then to the Rodney special,

897
00:53:58,921 --> 00:54:03,420
and then I just blew up from the Rodney
special and he started right away with

898
00:54:03,421 --> 00:54:07,290
the like to me antisemetic
bullshit because if he didn't,

899
00:54:07,291 --> 00:54:11,190
he would have been the perfect
opening act for all of those arenas.

900
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:16,470
But everybody assumed that your
accent was an Italian thing.

901
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:21,290
Why he I look, you know what I
mean? When you think of a Jew,

902
00:54:21,630 --> 00:54:25,410
you know, you think of, you
think of [inaudible]. You
know what I mean? He's got,

903
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:28,320
God knows that.
You know what I mean?

904
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:32,390
If you are a decent looking
person with an attitude,

905
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:34,530
immediately you are an Italian guy.

906
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:37,860
But what was hilarious is like what
Italian do you know the was a giant

907
00:54:37,861 --> 00:54:42,000
motorcycle jacket with the collar. I'm
like the wholesale. So about the attitude.

908
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:46,380
I've always had a certain attitude.
Right. But it's the, the, it's,

909
00:54:46,381 --> 00:54:49,290
it's more of a New York thing
than it is an Italian thing.

910
00:54:49,291 --> 00:54:52,540
But for whatever reasons, people
thinking in that way. Yeah.

911
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:54,010
Italians have before long gone,

912
00:54:56,010 --> 00:55:00,100
I would see arguments go on
between two men about my,

913
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:04,950
my mother being Italian, you
know, and I would go, no,
she's Jewish. She's my mother.

914
00:55:04,951 --> 00:55:08,310
I would know. And they'd be like, dice.
And these are like gangster guys going,

915
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:11,780
you don't know what you're talking about.
This is between me and him.

916
00:55:11,830 --> 00:55:16,540
I go to my mother, I know what my
mother room, where was this? You know,

917
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:17,730
this is in Brooklyn.

918
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:22,650
This was at a flea market that they
turned a c is department store into a flea

919
00:55:22,651 --> 00:55:23,484
market.

920
00:55:23,670 --> 00:55:28,670
So I go there like every Saturday because
I love to shop and buy cotton things

921
00:55:29,790 --> 00:55:33,630
and you know, wristbands,
sweat, sweat, sweatshirts,

922
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:38,460
sweat socks. I couldn't buy enough
of them. And it was all booths.

923
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:39,631
You know what I mean?

924
00:55:39,631 --> 00:55:43,500
And I love going there and this is when
I was doing like Nassau Coliseum so

925
00:55:43,501 --> 00:55:46,650
people would freak out that I'm there.
So all these fights would start,

926
00:55:46,990 --> 00:55:51,990
cause the minute I'd be around guys they
would turn their attitudes on like they

927
00:55:52,381 --> 00:55:56,130
had to like gout, dice, dice. It
was crazy and Brooklyn for me.

928
00:55:56,370 --> 00:56:00,900
But I love it whenever you get around
any young men looking to prove themselves

929
00:56:00,901 --> 00:56:03,150
and you're a 30 year olds.

930
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:07,050
I was 30 and going dice.
You don't understand.

931
00:56:07,051 --> 00:56:11,010
I know your mother for 25 yeah, I
can put, I know it since I was born,

932
00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:14,670
I was bar Mitzvah'd.
They cut his dick off when I was born.

933
00:56:14,671 --> 00:56:19,380
I had a Bris they wanted to claim
you. It was hysterical. You know,

934
00:56:19,890 --> 00:56:22,440
you know, but you know in
this photo, but it's never,

935
00:56:22,441 --> 00:56:24,400
it's not like know you ever said

936
00:56:24,450 --> 00:56:28,350
that you were Italian. It's not like
anything you've ever hid. It's no,

937
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:31,240
it's just for whatever reason they
claimed it for like a little while.

938
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:36,940
They're still claiming it. But you
know, I grew up in a neighborhood,

939
00:56:36,941 --> 00:56:39,490
it was all Jews and Italians.
That's what I grew up with.

940
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:43,000
But the thing that disturbs me is
that like at living in New York,

941
00:56:43,001 --> 00:56:46,830
I know a lot of Jews who talk exactly
the same way. You want to know what not.

942
00:56:46,890 --> 00:56:50,170
It's not a thing that only Italian stone.
It was funny Redmond,

943
00:56:50,530 --> 00:56:54,460
it was the Irish guys. It was the
Irish guys that would, that would,

944
00:56:54,490 --> 00:56:57,730
that I'd fight, that would put
me in the hospital all the time.

945
00:56:57,970 --> 00:57:01,700
And then that's what I wanted
up. My ex wife is Irish. Um,

946
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:06,440
fucking Eleanor's Irish
Irish dudes who've been,

947
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:10,810
I had a friend who had his finger bitten
off in a street fight when he's on PCP

948
00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:12,890
and he had his toe come on e Bay.

949
00:57:13,090 --> 00:57:17,680
He had his toe cut off to replace the
finger and he had it permanently bent so

950
00:57:17,681 --> 00:57:22,090
he could keep throwing his right hook. So
he would shake your hand. He was on PCP,

951
00:57:22,091 --> 00:57:25,420
might cut his own finger roll.
You shake your hand. He would, uh,

952
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:29,620
finger would be like tickling me. But he
was a hell of a boxing coach. Joe Lake,

953
00:57:29,621 --> 00:57:34,090
shout out to Joe Lake, Shell Lake.
He's a great guy. Tremendous guy.

954
00:57:34,091 --> 00:57:38,470
Joey fucking ass. Sick.
Awesome Irishman from Boston.

955
00:57:38,471 --> 00:57:42,340
Like a real guy. Like if you made
a movie about my friend Joe Lake,

956
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:46,390
he was a Longshoreman who was a
professional boxer, a great boxing coach,

957
00:57:46,391 --> 00:57:49,390
trained a bunch of great boxers
and he was a fucking animal.

958
00:57:49,391 --> 00:57:53,100
He was talking about via fighting.
No violence.

959
00:57:53,130 --> 00:57:58,060
You don't know psychos like this?
No, no, I do. My wife Valerie,

960
00:57:58,420 --> 00:58:01,390
you know, you reminded
me. No, no, no cycle.

961
00:58:01,391 --> 00:58:06,391
But just to shout out with some sexy
when you get to Vegas tomorrow with

962
00:58:06,410 --> 00:58:08,830
something high school. Well this is
what that was. You know what that was?

963
00:58:08,831 --> 00:58:13,060
That was to make sure that
she's listening. Did you
listen to me? Listen to me.

964
00:58:13,061 --> 00:58:15,940
What? I send that thing to you. You
didn't listen to me. Oh, she likes really,

965
00:58:16,270 --> 00:58:19,840
really put it together.
She likes putting it together.

966
00:58:19,841 --> 00:58:24,230
You know the Mexican girls with
the colors and the fuck. Good.

967
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:28,990
Really beautiful by the way.
You've scored.

968
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:32,680
She's really beautiful. I met her in Vegas
and I was just blown out of the water.

969
00:58:32,681 --> 00:58:36,370
She's very coarse dice clay
bank. You respect. Thank you.

970
00:58:36,371 --> 00:58:40,120
[inaudible] I respect that compliment.
It's a good compliment.

971
00:58:40,390 --> 00:58:43,890
But you didn't say anything dirty about
it like when you walked away. No, no, no.

972
00:58:46,070 --> 00:58:49,270
Thank you. Where your Spec you too
Joe. Right? Never. Never. You know,

973
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:53,020
cause I would never say nothing about
yours unless she was beautiful and I'm not

974
00:58:53,021 --> 00:58:56,620
that kind of a guy I ever met. You'll
go, no, I'll keep her away from now.

975
00:58:56,621 --> 00:59:00,690
You marry your story.
I've heard she's beautiful though.

976
00:59:01,470 --> 00:59:04,720
Very nice person. That's the
most important thing, man.

977
00:59:04,721 --> 00:59:07,410
I've been around pretty girls
before that weren't nice. Yeah.

978
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:12,220
But they've got to have the subside. I
gotta Shit. My wife is sweet. She's smart.

979
00:59:12,221 --> 00:59:14,200
She backs up my career with that.
Yeah.

980
00:59:14,270 --> 00:59:17,530
Doing everything I'm doing because she
told me to go do it. That's beautiful.

981
00:59:17,531 --> 00:59:20,830
That's, that's simple that in that
case relationships are always worth it.

982
00:59:21,070 --> 00:59:25,130
So many of us settle for some sort
of a weird combination of, uh,

983
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:29,210
of that and then an enemy that you live
with that. So that's gets real weird.

984
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:33,700
People get real weird with that man and
was a lot of times you even [inaudible].

985
00:59:33,890 --> 00:59:38,810
Even though me and Eleanor broke up, we
were never enemies do all of it. Yeah.

986
00:59:38,860 --> 00:59:43,640
We had I think a lot of fighting between
people that you started off getting

987
00:59:43,641 --> 00:59:47,030
along good.
I just don't like when she interrupts me,

988
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:49,900
you know when I'm around him right now

989
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:54,910
it's called compensation. I don't
know. This is how guys do it.

990
00:59:56,490 --> 00:59:58,310
That's okay with us,
but every people,

991
00:59:58,510 --> 01:00:01,200
people will listen to the
podcasts all the time and go dice,

992
01:00:01,210 --> 01:00:05,090
interrupt you constantly. I'm like,
you've never done once we're just talking.

993
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:07,040
Yeah. She goes to that high pitch. Yeah.

994
01:00:07,070 --> 01:00:11,570
That nasally when you're all talking
at the same time and nobody can predict

995
01:00:11,571 --> 01:00:14,510
who's going to be talking or what's going
on or something comes into your head.

996
01:00:14,511 --> 01:00:15,470
You got to say it.

997
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:19,070
You got to go with the
flow of a conversation and
that includes interrupting

998
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:20,660
people.
We're not in a David Mamet movie.

999
01:00:20,661 --> 01:00:23,780
It doesn't have to like follow a fucking
script saying I can't talk to you

1000
01:00:23,781 --> 01:00:25,440
because you two are men and I'm

1001
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:33,380
in your face.
Me that much bothers me.

1002
01:00:33,381 --> 01:00:37,790
Only a little of the smoke bothers you.
It does.

1003
01:00:37,791 --> 01:00:41,630
When he does it oddly because I love
them and I'm trying to get them to not

1004
01:00:42,980 --> 01:00:46,590
worry about it again. You need red
and listen. If I love him, he's great.

1005
01:00:46,670 --> 01:00:48,290
He's a great friend.
If we do the rub,

1006
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:51,410
that's where you break my balls with the
cigarettes cause then you'll need me to,

1007
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:52,810
I'll look.
I,

1008
01:00:52,811 --> 01:00:56,720
I only hung out with you a few times
and I would sit down and have the

1009
01:00:56,721 --> 01:01:00,440
conversation with you know, but you,
but I do love you. You're a great guy.

1010
01:01:00,441 --> 01:01:03,890
I like being around you. I love your act.
I respect you very much. As an artist,

1011
01:01:04,340 --> 01:01:08,390
I think that poisoning your body with
cigarettes is a stupid way to die.

1012
01:01:08,570 --> 01:01:11,380
Not only that, but you don't understand.
I'm going to, I'm going to go.

1013
01:01:12,110 --> 01:01:16,340
You don't understand. It's a way though.
It's why did I start that again? Okay.

1014
01:01:16,341 --> 01:01:17,880
I didn't smoke for 10 cold years.

1015
01:01:18,230 --> 01:01:22,790
He made me quit when my
father was on his last days.

1016
01:01:22,791 --> 01:01:26,600
I lit up. So I'm only smoking a
year. It's not about an excuse,

1017
01:01:26,601 --> 01:01:29,750
it's just what happened.
I am going to quit again,

1018
01:01:29,751 --> 01:01:34,380
but this is not the week it's
happening. Well you know what, you,

1019
01:01:34,470 --> 01:01:36,020
you know what the fuck is best for you.

1020
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:39,650
You're not a child and I would never
tell you what to do or what not to do.

1021
01:01:39,651 --> 01:01:44,030
What can you advise and Max as well.
We want them to quit on me with it,

1022
01:01:44,031 --> 01:01:47,090
but they also understand what I'm
going through. But it also, you know,

1023
01:01:47,091 --> 01:01:50,240
I've got to respect, Brian said something
on the podcast the other day. I said,

1024
01:01:50,241 --> 01:01:51,350
why do you like to smoke?

1025
01:01:51,351 --> 01:01:56,351
And he fucking pretty passionate about
how great it feels and how much he loves

1026
01:01:56,901 --> 01:01:58,850
it and how it's great after a meal.
And you know what?

1027
01:01:58,851 --> 01:02:00,680
I got to respect that as a human being.

1028
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:04,970
He's got a right to make a choice and
that choice, but I'm also smart enough.

1029
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:08,930
That's why I did quit cause I just
didn't want to smoke anymore. You know?

1030
01:02:08,931 --> 01:02:11,840
And I would hold an unlit cigarette.
I didn't kept people smoked around me.

1031
01:02:11,841 --> 01:02:15,530
I just got to wean myself off of
it again. Well, and when I quit,

1032
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:19,980
I won't even wean it, you know, I'll just
quit and that'll be it. I bet I would

1033
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:22,290
enjoy it.
I bet I wouldn't show the nicotine rush.

1034
01:02:22,291 --> 01:02:25,020
Steven King said it was
one of his, um, his, uh,

1035
01:02:25,050 --> 01:02:28,360
biggest cognitive benefits and that the,
uh,

1036
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:31,740
that smoking gave him rather cognitive
benefits and that he recognized a big

1037
01:02:31,741 --> 01:02:34,500
difference when you quit
smoking. He said his, uh, his,

1038
01:02:34,510 --> 01:02:39,110
his brain was firing slower as creativity
wasn't as, as, as rampant, which a,

1039
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:42,720
you know, I'm sure I would
like to just not the moment,
you know, for me right now,

1040
01:02:42,810 --> 01:02:47,190
I like cigars. I enjoy [inaudible]
hates to go after a fat steak.

1041
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:50,940
There's nothing like chilling
with a cigar. I love it. Fat Stay.

1042
01:02:50,941 --> 01:02:53,660
Me and Kevin James have
murdered some fucking steaks.

1043
01:02:54,070 --> 01:02:57,000
We smoked some fat Cuban cigars
before and it's a pleasure.

1044
01:02:57,180 --> 01:03:00,990
And it's a real buzz too. It's
kind of weird. Mellow high.

1045
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:03,780
It's not a high where you're worried
about driving a car or anything like that.

1046
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:07,580
You have total control of your sentence,
but it's like a, but it's like, ah,

1047
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:12,180
it's just, ah, it's a reason why I quit
smoking cigars for one hit off a cigar.

1048
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:16,470
I feel stoned. Yeah. It makes
it kind of like, it does,

1049
01:03:17,370 --> 01:03:22,170
it does make you high a ball, you know,
nicotine in its natural form, like in the,

1050
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:25,320
that, that form of tobacco that
you get in a cigar. First of all,

1051
01:03:25,321 --> 01:03:29,070
it's not as bad for you. And second
of all, it's used in shamonic rituals.

1052
01:03:29,071 --> 01:03:32,340
They use it in Peru,
in the Amazon and IOWASCA rituals.

1053
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:36,510
This schamens will below the
tobacco smoke in your face,

1054
01:03:36,511 --> 01:03:40,920
in the middle of the psychedelic
trip to to create bigger and broader

1055
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:44,000
psychedelic experiences,
like to actually instigate them.

1056
01:03:44,490 --> 01:03:47,320
So it's gotten psychoactive compounds,
smoking.

1057
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:50,650
We know we had a guy on the puck county,
how he named a rock.

1058
01:03:51,330 --> 01:03:53,100
We had a guy in the podcast name Rob Wolf,

1059
01:03:53,101 --> 01:03:57,150
who is the author of the Paleo solution
and he said that people chew nicotine

1060
01:03:57,180 --> 01:03:59,370
gum and it really helps their creativity.

1061
01:03:59,610 --> 01:04:03,840
So like nicotine itself is
probably beneficial in a
lot of ways and almost like

1062
01:04:03,841 --> 01:04:04,674
a caffeine,

1063
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:07,830
like there's nothing really wrong with
the real problem is a delivery method

1064
01:04:07,831 --> 01:04:11,260
that's been designed to make sure that
you're addicted. It's that paper. Well,

1065
01:04:11,290 --> 01:04:12,300
it's not just the paper,

1066
01:04:12,530 --> 01:04:15,540
those chemicals that's mixed
into the tobacco that's designed.

1067
01:04:15,541 --> 01:04:17,970
If you've watched the movie the insider,
do you ever watch that movie,

1068
01:04:17,971 --> 01:04:20,550
Russell Crowe? It's fucking
fantastic. Unbelievable.

1069
01:04:20,610 --> 01:04:24,660
It really based on a real story and
based on how the tobacco industry has

1070
01:04:24,810 --> 01:04:26,460
somehow or another condo,

1071
01:04:26,790 --> 01:04:29,760
all these politicians into allowing
them to do what they're doing,

1072
01:04:29,761 --> 01:04:33,300
which is pumping thousands of
fucking different chemicals.

1073
01:04:33,301 --> 01:04:38,301
I think it's 590 actually 590 different
chemicals are approved and every

1074
01:04:38,311 --> 01:04:40,760
cigarette, not thousands
but hundreds. But,

1075
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:43,160
but that's an insane amount of
number of chemicals. It's, it's,

1076
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:44,520
you think you're getting a cigarette,

1077
01:04:44,730 --> 01:04:48,750
you're getting like this chemically
soaked leaf that's dried out.

1078
01:04:48,751 --> 01:04:51,560
It's basically the cigarette
burning is inconsequential.

1079
01:04:51,570 --> 01:04:53,460
It's a delivery method
for all these chemicals.

1080
01:04:53,660 --> 01:04:57,960
And so you can call it a cigarette and
it Kinda is, but it's also kind of not.

1081
01:04:58,080 --> 01:05:02,490
It's kind of a delivery method for all
these 590 different chemicals and most of

1082
01:05:02,491 --> 01:05:06,930
them designed to make you addicted.
You're not a college professor read,

1083
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:11,790
you have all this information. Yeah,
but it's just stuff that I've read.

1084
01:05:11,791 --> 01:05:14,950
It's just stuff that I've read. Look,
I've done no research on my own.

1085
01:05:15,420 --> 01:05:16,440
Also retained it.

1086
01:05:16,890 --> 01:05:20,620
I only retain things that are important
to you and you could ask me things about

1087
01:05:20,621 --> 01:05:22,510
things that are important to me.
They don't even go in there.

1088
01:05:22,580 --> 01:05:24,670
I felt like almost like a retard sprain.

1089
01:05:24,940 --> 01:05:29,590
I have a very like half broken,
like things that I don't care about.

1090
01:05:29,620 --> 01:05:33,520
I don't care. I don't give up.
Especially once I started making money,

1091
01:05:33,610 --> 01:05:37,390
I lost all my ability to care about
shit. It don't care about like, you know,

1092
01:05:37,391 --> 01:05:40,450
like people will call me to get me
to do things and I'm just fucking,

1093
01:05:40,451 --> 01:05:45,090
I don't answer the phone.
I just disappeared. I was
trying to call him mister.

1094
01:05:45,091 --> 01:05:48,320
Yeah. I shut my phone off and I could
get it to taste good for you. No,

1095
01:05:48,380 --> 01:05:50,050
but I'd get like a text.
I bet you know.

1096
01:05:50,051 --> 01:05:54,220
Let me just call him rather than with
the texting. He never picks up. No,

1097
01:05:54,221 --> 01:05:58,180
that was because I was in
my car. I'm like, I have a
Porsche. Porsche is so loud.

1098
01:05:58,390 --> 01:06:01,150
It's a gt three. It's one those racing
cars, so when you drive it's like,

1099
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:06,150
so that's what you're here and be like,
hey guys,

1100
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:09,100
didn't car

1101
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:14,790
really juvenile acid nine car.
It's a total douche bag car.

1102
01:06:14,910 --> 01:06:16,200
If you looked at the guide dog,
you like,

1103
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:18,450
what kind of Douche bag needs
to drive a car like this?

1104
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:23,540
See if I like the portion. I feel about
the challenges. Oh, it's fucking true.

1105
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:27,920
Car would be American cock.
That's what car are we good?

1106
01:06:29,220 --> 01:06:32,450
Well call would get.
Oh and are excited at Cadillac.

1107
01:06:33,030 --> 01:06:36,860
Oh yeah. You know that. No, but
the big Cadillac, the Brown,

1108
01:06:37,740 --> 01:06:41,730
well this one's from the color of money.
I drove in the color of money.

1109
01:06:41,820 --> 01:06:44,850
I gave her one. I got, I got
named it. You shut your face.

1110
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:47,400
I got one as a consolation
prize when I left.

1111
01:06:47,401 --> 01:06:51,750
I got a 95 fleet with which
you got one is a constellation.

1112
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:56,450
Nice enterprises. Yeah. I gave
it to me, checked out a hotel,

1113
01:06:56,630 --> 01:06:59,550
how she would be adult enough
to know how to take care of it,

1114
01:07:00,690 --> 01:07:02,790
you know what I mean?
And she would just break it.

1115
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:07,680
You broke it and she broke the mirror
off the side that because you couldn't

1116
01:07:07,681 --> 01:07:08,150
back up

1117
01:07:08,150 --> 01:07:08,983
proper

1118
01:07:10,290 --> 01:07:14,730
backing up. This is the same
argument. I didn't break the mirror.

1119
01:07:14,731 --> 01:07:18,030
I didn't break any
perfect way.

1120
01:07:18,031 --> 01:07:22,530
And you got a quote and
you broke it off man. Okay.

1121
01:07:23,750 --> 01:07:25,920
We tried to the audience at home.

1122
01:07:25,921 --> 01:07:29,590
It's not going to give a fuck about who
crashed your old car. No, no. But it was

1123
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:35,180
just fuck that shit.
Your moons, everything.

1124
01:07:35,970 --> 01:07:36,680
If that was

1125
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:40,030
women, I would say, listen baby, we're
rich. Let's just fix this shit. Say

1126
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:45,430
No, no, no. But I gave it to us so
she'd have something to drive away.

1127
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:47,330
So by, by the way, those are,

1128
01:07:47,660 --> 01:07:52,110
those are very difficult to drive and she
was able to throw the boxes, you know,

1129
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:54,333
it's a big trunk.

1130
01:07:54,430 --> 01:07:58,010
I love when I love when they roll in
this stuff and then they roll it out.

1131
01:07:58,011 --> 01:08:01,070
That's the best off. He didn't,
you know, and I'm thinking,

1132
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:07,130
yeah, I filmed, you
know Joe. So I was like,

1133
01:08:07,190 --> 01:08:11,740
I know what breaking up, but I got to
get the shot. Know I really enjoyed, well

1134
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:13,860
when I was working at the comedy store,
when you would do these,

1135
01:08:13,890 --> 01:08:16,400
you would put on these little in the back

1136
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:18,710
and it would be for your own amusement.
And I was always like,

1137
01:08:18,860 --> 01:08:21,590
well what are we gonna do with all this
stuff? Just for your own amusement.

1138
01:08:21,770 --> 01:08:24,800
He would have like, okay, now you're
going to come running through the door.

1139
01:08:24,980 --> 01:08:26,300
Fuck you.

1140
01:08:26,380 --> 01:08:31,380
And you tackle him shooting a TV show,

1141
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:36,920
you know? And you know, and you know, I
would shoot it while they were roping,

1142
01:08:37,220 --> 01:08:39,260
you know what I mean?
Because I'm going to afford a set.

1143
01:08:39,300 --> 01:08:41,450
And he was all handheld
camera and it was all,

1144
01:08:41,451 --> 01:08:44,630
it seemed like a lot of it was just spur
of the moment if you, if you saw it,

1145
01:08:44,750 --> 01:08:49,070
but it's not, I'm really thinking
about the episode. Okay. So, you know,

1146
01:08:49,071 --> 01:08:52,730
I wouldn't tell anybody what they were
bad. I would say this is what I need.

1147
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:57,650
And sometimes like if we were in the
comedy store, a kitchen, you know,

1148
01:08:57,651 --> 01:09:00,110
that'd be a waitress that
I didn't cast in the show.

1149
01:09:00,430 --> 01:09:04,220
So I would make me get out in the
kitchen. I say, you can't be in the shot.

1150
01:09:04,221 --> 01:09:07,220
And she's like, yeah, I
don't care about your drinks.

1151
01:09:07,221 --> 01:09:08,600
I'm trying to get my shot here.

1152
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:12,910
Like Eleanor had a fist fight with wheels
in the kitchen one time where wheels

1153
01:09:12,911 --> 01:09:16,190
is smacking her head again. The only
guy who employs wheels these days,

1154
01:09:16,490 --> 01:09:20,990
I don't see wheels. Wheels go see him.
I'd never seen him doing stand up. Well,

1155
01:09:21,070 --> 01:09:24,430
well he's still,
he in Vegas now and he's in Vegas.

1156
01:09:25,980 --> 01:09:27,610
Who was responsible for the clip to,

1157
01:09:27,611 --> 01:09:31,730
they used to have where he claimed that
he got his start them and fame after he

1158
01:09:31,731 --> 01:09:34,760
blew you off stage one night at a club

1159
01:09:37,420 --> 01:09:38,620
very well.

1160
01:09:38,630 --> 01:09:43,630
But wheels was sort of
pushed into things years ago.

1161
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:48,410
Well we liked by other people.
It had nothing to do with someone.

1162
01:09:48,411 --> 01:09:51,560
So someone else wrote that forum?
Well, no, he was made to do that.

1163
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:55,220
We always told me he was like a
professional pool player. Yeah,

1164
01:09:55,221 --> 01:09:57,410
he is wheels

1165
01:09:59,150 --> 01:10:03,200
and we went to a, so we worked
in San Diego. I said, okay.
I play a lot of pull too,

1166
01:10:03,201 --> 01:10:07,010
because I play a lot of pool,
a famous makers.

1167
01:10:07,011 --> 01:10:09,740
I have a professional table in my house.
I play in tournaments.

1168
01:10:09,741 --> 01:10:13,120
I play a lot of pool. So like, so

1169
01:10:15,310 --> 01:10:18,770
wills, wills tells me that he plays
professional pool. So I said, well,

1170
01:10:18,771 --> 01:10:22,460
let's fuck around and just play a
dollar game. $25 later. I'm like, dude,

1171
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:26,630
you can't play pool. You can't
fucking play pool. He lied.

1172
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:31,550
He can barely make a couple of balls.
But he's not a professional level. No,

1173
01:10:31,551 --> 01:10:36,440
but he is a professional
liar. No. Let me tell you,

1174
01:10:36,441 --> 01:10:39,990
Stan didn't trick me 25
games in. Well, you know,

1175
01:10:40,030 --> 01:10:44,630
he still owes me that money of course.
But he's a funny competent.

1176
01:10:45,030 --> 01:10:46,970
He's just a funny dude to be around.

1177
01:10:47,380 --> 01:10:50,930
One of the funniest guys selling out in
a good dude. I don't mean anything bad,

1178
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:53,570
but it's a true story. You can't, you
can't fuck with me on the pool table.

1179
01:10:55,530 --> 01:10:58,750
Well that was the most ridiculous shit.
Everything that you can play with.

1180
01:10:58,830 --> 01:11:01,670
When I went to Vegas the last few
times, I would be like, wheels,

1181
01:11:01,671 --> 01:11:05,060
you want to hang out at night? You
know? And he goes, I can't, you know,

1182
01:11:05,061 --> 01:11:08,120
because of what I'm doing right now.
I go, what are you doing? He goes,

1183
01:11:08,390 --> 01:11:13,070
well I'm doing the inspirational talks.
He was hired from some company.

1184
01:11:13,380 --> 01:11:14,280
He put on a suit

1185
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:15,720
and tie five in the morning.

1186
01:11:15,730 --> 01:11:20,730
He's getting dressed and show up and do
these inspirational talks and get paid

1187
01:11:21,181 --> 01:11:25,910
for it.
And he's getting it from the Gary.

1188
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:28,950
What's that movie you love?
Glengarry Glen Ross.

1189
01:11:29,730 --> 01:11:33,880
That's where he'd get his monologues. So
I'm still the speech. Yeah. Oh my God.

1190
01:11:34,170 --> 01:11:37,420
Genius. Oh my God. And make
a lot of money doing it.

1191
01:11:38,650 --> 01:11:42,870
Anybody not know? Then he's got
his catering company. He had a kid,

1192
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:47,100
he's got a catering company called the
cannoli. King's herders. Caterings.

1193
01:11:47,101 --> 01:11:49,230
Very good.
Which is gigantic in La.

1194
01:11:49,950 --> 01:11:54,300
And then he'll just move to South Carolina
for a year and then I call him up.

1195
01:11:54,301 --> 01:11:56,190
I got what's going on? He
goes, well we're in Vegas.

1196
01:11:56,191 --> 01:12:00,990
I got to Walmart it cause we moved here
and then he opens a comedy club and then

1197
01:12:00,991 --> 01:12:03,930
he becomes an inspirational speaker.
Next thing you know,

1198
01:12:03,931 --> 01:12:06,630
you're walking down the street and he's
got one of those meet trucks that he

1199
01:12:06,631 --> 01:12:11,310
started. He, he, you know, wheels,

1200
01:12:11,850 --> 01:12:16,420
wheels, got a couple of nicknames. One
of them was wheels. One of them. Look,

1201
01:12:16,570 --> 01:12:18,920
wait what you're saying,
look at it.

1202
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:23,700
Areas number one chef in the country.

1203
01:12:25,770 --> 01:12:27,080
Well he is a good cook though.

1204
01:12:27,540 --> 01:12:32,220
He brought some amazing due to the comedy
store and it's fucking just so funny

1205
01:12:32,820 --> 01:12:36,990
character. He's such a character. It's
fucking, it's, and he's a very good cook.

1206
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,480
He's a very good cook. Whatever the
fuck he brought to the comedy story,

1207
01:12:39,510 --> 01:12:41,400
brought a bunch of lists
and cocktailing for him.

1208
01:12:43,370 --> 01:12:48,180
You shut your face. And I was
cocktailing and he goes, he goes, listen,

1209
01:12:48,190 --> 01:12:52,250
Nah. I was screaming. And
I go, hey wheels, we need
more whatever. He goes, oh,

1210
01:12:52,290 --> 01:12:55,860
can you call me chef? Yeah.
She would work with him

1211
01:12:58,340 --> 01:13:02,820
and
he would do these professional,

1212
01:13:02,821 --> 01:13:06,970
we're professor Joe. He
would do these Jackie. Yeah.

1213
01:13:07,590 --> 01:13:12,180
But there's nothing wrong with
wheels like easy as opposed to

1214
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:17,760
it's a little flavor party.

1215
01:13:19,430 --> 01:13:23,900
He did this party for some
uh, black cigarette. Um,

1216
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:28,800
that was fast. Newport? Yes. It's
gotta be 300 people. Cigarettes.

1217
01:13:30,350 --> 01:13:34,860
Menthols yeah, my mom,
it was African Americans.

1218
01:13:34,890 --> 01:13:39,840
There wasn't one white person there
and I show up with the camera. Right.

1219
01:13:40,110 --> 01:13:41,790
You know, with, with the camera.

1220
01:13:41,820 --> 01:13:46,530
Just for footage because I'm filming my
show and wheels is like yelling at me.

1221
01:13:46,531 --> 01:13:50,850
You got to leave, you know, I'm getting
paid a lot of money and I'm going wheels.

1222
01:13:51,150 --> 01:13:53,630
How am I going to get my shot?
You know,

1223
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:58,380
if I don't show up at the potty and I'm
just filming us with him throwing me out

1224
01:13:58,381 --> 01:14:01,270
of the party and she's waitressing.
Not really.

1225
01:14:01,350 --> 01:14:04,770
I was just rounding up black girls
to surround him cause he was taking,

1226
01:14:05,060 --> 01:14:06,840
I didn't need your help.
Trust

1227
01:14:08,580 --> 01:14:11,890
just fucking hit me girls,
why you diminish?

1228
01:14:12,230 --> 01:14:16,190
You see women are always silent.
Get came. It's making this because?

1229
01:14:16,340 --> 01:14:20,380
Because she picks up the hands,
we're not allowed to hit back.

1230
01:14:20,381 --> 01:14:25,381
Be Clear if that's taking advantage
because she keeps putting her hands on me.

1231
01:14:27,750 --> 01:14:32,600
I hate Eleanor. Please
relax. We got to talk about,

1232
01:14:32,620 --> 01:14:35,590
you know what? I know he, I
know he's like a 10th degree,

1233
01:14:35,890 --> 01:14:40,110
but I happened to know karate
kick your Eleanor's wrestled.

1234
01:14:40,150 --> 01:14:44,290
If I have to use karate to see me wrestle,
I did. I want to see a restaurant.

1235
01:14:44,291 --> 01:14:48,330
We're fictionally but I
got pissed off at that. No,

1236
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:53,110
because it could ruin like
that, you know, thoughts area.

1237
01:14:53,460 --> 01:14:54,520
Yeah.
You know what I mean?

1238
01:14:54,521 --> 01:14:58,390
He could break and I'm like
anything to be on fucking TV.

1239
01:14:58,391 --> 01:15:02,080
What's wrong with guilt? Oh wait a minute,
a minute. And, and Eleanor's defense,

1240
01:15:02,230 --> 01:15:04,480
me and I rather,

1241
01:15:04,490 --> 01:15:09,490
and a bunch of people from the comedy
store went down and we had a great fucking

1242
01:15:09,491 --> 01:15:11,050
time.
We bought waitresses.

1243
01:15:11,051 --> 01:15:15,610
Comics had a big group to support
Eleanor and she was easy rider.

1244
01:15:15,611 --> 01:15:17,140
She played this motorcycle girl,

1245
01:15:17,141 --> 01:15:22,120
boxer sorta type wrestler chick who
would a crush pool balls in her hands.

1246
01:15:22,450 --> 01:15:27,450
But she just wants to do traumatic fucking
rolls and tumble salt and the ring,

1247
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:31,810
I think, I think it's better for Eleanor.
I mean, I've known Eleanor forever.

1248
01:15:31,811 --> 01:15:33,940
I think it's better for her to
not take yourself seriously.

1249
01:15:33,941 --> 01:15:37,750
So doing something like that,
but that's a, your charm,

1250
01:15:37,751 --> 01:15:41,230
your charm is that you're so ridiculously
silly and you're so over the top.

1251
01:15:41,350 --> 01:15:42,520
Eleanor and I used to do this thing.

1252
01:15:42,521 --> 01:15:45,520
I don't think we ever talked about it on
the podcast. Where did we talk about it?

1253
01:15:46,060 --> 01:15:50,590
Ask Her for change. When I go
on stage, people are like, Hey,

1254
01:15:50,591 --> 01:15:53,230
can I record it? Listen, I'm
not going to figure myself.

1255
01:15:55,370 --> 01:15:58,480
It was like, are still, it was the
stupidest running gag. And I would say,

1256
01:15:59,230 --> 01:16:04,030
this is what, this is what it
was, where you went to listen.

1257
01:16:04,031 --> 01:16:08,710
I'll explain. I'll explain it. You're not,

1258
01:16:08,830 --> 01:16:13,420
it's wrong. Her Apron was on
and this is what we do. It
would be, would go, uh, hey,

1259
01:16:13,470 --> 01:16:18,250
um, I want, I want to get changed
for a dollar for the meter,

1260
01:16:18,410 --> 01:16:21,430
but do you have change for a dollar?
You Go, hold on a second, let me get it.

1261
01:16:21,550 --> 01:16:26,230
And she would dig in her apron and
going this whole routine pretending to

1262
01:16:26,380 --> 01:16:28,120
masturbate herself to climax it.

1263
01:16:28,121 --> 01:16:31,060
She didn't want anybody to come in near
and people try to rescue where it was

1264
01:16:31,210 --> 01:16:35,530
fucking hilarious. Hilarious
about it. Cause it lets muck,

1265
01:16:35,750 --> 01:16:37,170
we did it for years,

1266
01:16:37,450 --> 01:16:42,130
but I'm waiting at home for this tells me,
you know,

1267
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:47,200
my shift is over at 1130 but now it's
two in the morning and she comes walking

1268
01:16:47,861 --> 01:16:50,890
in telling me that uh, you
know, we never kept her late.

1269
01:16:50,891 --> 01:16:54,670
She was doing that turn up but this
is the kind of shit you would do.

1270
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:59,290
I'm going and she's helping comics
with debt, personal fucking problems.

1271
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:02,650
Then I'm like, I don't give a
fuck if the guy falls off a cliff.

1272
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:07,380
She is waiting here. I
got a hard on, you know,

1273
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:10,280
as a,
as a brother,

1274
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:14,750
comedian. I appreciate that. But
as someone he loves hilarious Shit.

1275
01:17:14,751 --> 01:17:19,370
And as someone who also supportive of
the fact that that's one of the reasons

1276
01:17:19,371 --> 01:17:22,580
why she's a professional
comedian now cause we all
knew she was so fucking funny.

1277
01:17:22,700 --> 01:17:26,600
I know was when she was just
a waitress. Yeah, of course
you did. Yeah. We all knew.

1278
01:17:26,630 --> 01:17:28,220
We all knew no one,
no one doubted it.

1279
01:17:28,230 --> 01:17:31,860
We knew you as a waitress and you would
be like the funniest person hanging

1280
01:17:31,930 --> 01:17:34,310
around with backstage and it was,
it was,

1281
01:17:34,311 --> 01:17:37,100
it was ridiculous that you were an
onstage and you would like, I would,

1282
01:17:37,130 --> 01:17:40,040
I would always go to Eleanor.
What if anybody knew one on stage?

1283
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:43,910
Is that going to be funding? She'd go
hat and like walk away and I knew that.

1284
01:17:44,110 --> 01:17:48,050
Yeah, watch this watch. I know
dude. Do Bruce Mann off? No,

1285
01:17:48,051 --> 01:17:49,760
don't make one joke.
Just do it.

1286
01:17:51,180 --> 01:17:53,400
When Jews are ugly,
we win prizes.

1287
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:58,730
Do Dom dom,
I can't do that.

1288
01:17:59,250 --> 01:18:03,440
I can't think of one of my favorite
John Joke right now as the,

1289
01:18:03,450 --> 01:18:07,590
that he adopted an Asian girl to
help him with his iPhone. No, but no,

1290
01:18:07,610 --> 01:18:11,160
but she knows she's going back
as soon as I get these apps down.

1291
01:18:12,220 --> 01:18:13,430
Talk to fucking,

1292
01:18:14,050 --> 01:18:14,410
but,

1293
01:18:14,410 --> 01:18:19,410
but she knows every comic problem because
doing my own material I'm writing.

1294
01:18:20,580 --> 01:18:25,480
That's fine. As long as you have that
auditing in your own head, you know,

1295
01:18:25,570 --> 01:18:29,170
everybody is going to, especially in
the beginning of [inaudible] Andrew,

1296
01:18:29,171 --> 01:18:32,490
I'm like, aren't you, you, you
run the risk of maybe covering, so

1297
01:18:34,150 --> 01:18:37,300
this is the best way to hold Smith.

1298
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:40,750
This is back when the Oj with
thing was happening, right.

1299
01:18:40,780 --> 01:18:45,040
And I did this whole thing about
Marcia Clark dead. Uh, you know,

1300
01:18:45,041 --> 01:18:48,440
once you realize this was a big
TV shot for her, she's still,

1301
01:18:48,441 --> 01:18:52,390
all of a sudden she'd come into
the courtroom with the pumps and,

1302
01:18:52,660 --> 01:18:56,410
and the scope with the slit up the side,
walking down the fucking aisle.

1303
01:18:56,411 --> 01:19:01,411
Like I want everybody to stare in this
fucking ass and get in here for a while

1304
01:19:01,780 --> 01:19:06,640
and build a TV Korea. So Holtzman did
something kind of similar to the j.

1305
01:19:06,940 --> 01:19:10,030
So I come over at Tim and I know he's
not a finger, you know what I mean?

1306
01:19:10,630 --> 01:19:14,920
And I go, you know, I, I like do that
joke. And he goes, well, you know, dice,

1307
01:19:14,921 --> 01:19:18,730
we overlap. And I just started
fucking laughing. He goes, hey,

1308
01:19:18,820 --> 01:19:23,350
when a guy says that to you, it's like,
just do it. It's too fun. You know,

1309
01:19:23,351 --> 01:19:26,400
like when you approach somebody
about a joke that's similar, right?

1310
01:19:26,470 --> 01:19:30,460
They'll beat the get all defensive. It
becomes an argument. Someone's like, well,

1311
01:19:30,461 --> 01:19:32,320
you know, we overlap. Well,
you know, and I'm like,

1312
01:19:32,321 --> 01:19:36,580
what the fuck did I just started
laughing. He's so funny. He is hilarious.

1313
01:19:36,581 --> 01:19:38,230
But I agree with that
kind of in a certain way.

1314
01:19:38,231 --> 01:19:41,410
Like Brennan Walsh and I
overlap on a, uh, a fleshlight

1315
01:19:41,410 --> 01:19:45,010
joke and I know, I know he
didn't read. No, he didn't.

1316
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:49,060
He wouldn't have seen my bit and then
done a similar bet. He's not that dude,

1317
01:19:49,300 --> 01:19:53,140
but he had a similar conclusion and I was
like, well, that's the obvious thought.

1318
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:56,170
You know, like you, you, you thought,
I mean, if you're intelligent,

1319
01:19:56,171 --> 01:19:58,000
you thinking about it, there's a bunch
of different ways to approach it.

1320
01:19:58,001 --> 01:19:59,470
That's one of them. You
thought of it. I thought of it.

1321
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:02,860
His bits different than my bit, even
though it's based on the same premise,

1322
01:20:03,330 --> 01:20:06,780
I felt like that's overlapping. It's
no big deal. We overlap a little bit,

1323
01:20:06,781 --> 01:20:07,614
but I care.

1324
01:20:08,690 --> 01:20:11,640
Right. And it's, what is your
particular take on things?

1325
01:20:11,700 --> 01:20:14,130
I want to hear his take on it
and someone else has taken,

1326
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:16,110
the only problem is when
you hear them in a row,

1327
01:20:16,290 --> 01:20:18,740
the problem is when you hear him
like that night in a row, look,

1328
01:20:18,741 --> 01:20:21,810
if he's middling and you're headlining
and then he does the bit and then you

1329
01:20:21,811 --> 01:20:24,990
really can't do the bit because
it's kind of a, it's so similar.

1330
01:20:24,991 --> 01:20:27,180
You'd have to bring it
up. Like you'd go, Hey,

1331
01:20:27,181 --> 01:20:28,860
I want to cover the subject
that's already been covered.

1332
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:31,780
Covered in beaten to
death. Right, exactly.

1333
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:35,370
That's what I would do it in a way,
like at the store where like,

1334
01:20:35,371 --> 01:20:36,690
I know what the other guy brought up,

1335
01:20:36,691 --> 01:20:39,660
but let me tell you something and
then go it. Yeah. At the store.

1336
01:20:39,661 --> 01:20:42,540
But like when you're on the road doing
your show, you wouldn't want that though.

1337
01:20:42,541 --> 01:20:45,650
You would never want a guy. Oh,
but she does like this thing about,

1338
01:20:45,930 --> 01:20:49,780
I don't want to say it, you
know, with the, uh, with the, uh,

1339
01:20:50,380 --> 01:20:53,190
whispered in the maturity
with the glitter.

1340
01:20:54,370 --> 01:20:55,360
Oh,
the old man,

1341
01:20:57,960 --> 01:21:02,770
the old man do it. When the
old man's like, you know, I
fool around with older man.

1342
01:21:02,771 --> 01:21:05,260
I like older men, but when they come
nothing comes out. It's like air.

1343
01:21:05,261 --> 01:21:07,280
It's like right. You know, and then um,

1344
01:21:07,780 --> 01:21:09,850
but he does something similar
or something like that.

1345
01:21:10,330 --> 01:21:14,050
And I say it's like air and then you're
like, well shit, where did that go?

1346
01:21:14,940 --> 01:21:18,730
Then like two days later I'm like,
is that fucking glitter on my face?

1347
01:21:18,731 --> 01:21:21,810
And I'm like, oh, it's old man river.
His balls on my face and that's it.

1348
01:21:21,811 --> 01:21:23,920
It's something stupid like that.
Joe's just staring,

1349
01:21:25,250 --> 01:21:26,990
you know when you get
old and you choke off,

1350
01:21:26,991 --> 01:21:31,460
it's like a three day process and then
by like the third day when it finally,

1351
01:21:31,490 --> 01:21:34,800
whatever the fuck is in there comes
out at like just falls off the Tipi.

1352
01:21:34,820 --> 01:21:36,340
A cop on the balls,

1353
01:21:36,670 --> 01:21:41,240
you know what you know about that was
Holtzman Holtzman a little bit about a,

1354
01:21:41,241 --> 01:21:45,710
yeah, it's like, it's, it's
old paint that's been the
basement too long. He goes,

1355
01:21:45,890 --> 01:21:50,480
it's not the same call that it used to
be. That's real. He got a bit about, uh,

1356
01:21:52,420 --> 01:21:54,740
I don't want to do is
doing a Viagara, but, well,

1357
01:21:54,741 --> 01:21:57,260
I don't want to say it also because
I don't want him to, you know,

1358
01:21:57,290 --> 01:22:01,170
to not be able to do that big now, by the
way, do you know where Holtzman lists?

1359
01:22:01,210 --> 01:22:02,180
I know where's he live?

1360
01:22:02,740 --> 01:22:07,520
Yeah. Isn't it like Vietnam or
something? Not Marina del Rey. No,

1361
01:22:07,521 --> 01:22:10,070
I heard he, he moved to
Vietnam right now. Yeah.

1362
01:22:10,071 --> 01:22:13,330
Holtzman when he just did someone's
podcast. We're like, oh yeah,

1363
01:22:13,340 --> 01:22:16,790
I think he was on [inaudible] sometimes
those go to Thailand. Thailand.

1364
01:22:16,820 --> 01:22:21,710
That's what it is. He was
Chinaman hairless boy there.
He said, oh, he always Joe.

1365
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:25,170
I mean, he's just a kid. He's a
joke. He's a great guy. I love that.

1366
01:22:25,410 --> 01:22:28,870
Back up the joke. Just say it. It's
okay. That's what I mean. Everybody, you

1367
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:35,420
know. Um, so you both have a
joke about old people coming.

1368
01:22:35,450 --> 01:22:39,090
Terrible. Not like that. Yeah.
Well it's been done. Yeah.

1369
01:22:40,810 --> 01:22:43,040
Yeah. It makes sense to do
it. And it's funny. Yeah.

1370
01:22:43,070 --> 01:22:45,890
And it only happened because there was
like an old male and I was picking on one

1371
01:22:45,891 --> 01:22:48,470
night and I just went into it and every
once in a while he'd just bring it up.

1372
01:22:48,740 --> 01:22:51,440
How many great songs are written
about the same subjects, you know,

1373
01:22:51,441 --> 01:22:54,860
how many great sub the songs,
you know, cover, uh, you know,

1374
01:22:54,920 --> 01:22:58,100
really was real similar ground. Be Still
fucking love them cause they're great,

1375
01:22:58,430 --> 01:23:02,840
you know, and, and in comedy there's
certain things sacs especially is the,

1376
01:23:02,841 --> 01:23:05,650
which is always going to be hilarious.
It just is. And as, as it is,

1377
01:23:05,651 --> 01:23:08,020
let's extract as much of it out as we can.

1378
01:23:08,050 --> 01:23:11,800
You think we'd be overlapping a lot
if we did shows? I don't think so. No,

1379
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:14,680
we different, we have a different
point of view though. No, I agree.

1380
01:23:14,681 --> 01:23:17,800
I saw and just watched Joe a couple of
months ago at the Ice House and I think

1381
01:23:17,801 --> 01:23:19,690
it would be great.
I don't think that last night,

1382
01:23:20,010 --> 01:23:23,950
I mean seeing your show was so fun, but
you're so much more preposterous to me.

1383
01:23:24,170 --> 01:23:25,003
I just,

1384
01:23:26,430 --> 01:23:30,300
I tried to be a little more realistic
because you actually have facts in that I

1385
01:23:30,310 --> 01:23:34,550
can try to remember. I don't want to
be a an agent of disinformation. Yes.

1386
01:23:35,050 --> 01:23:39,430
You fucking act was so funny and
describing how the caves were created.

1387
01:23:41,810 --> 01:23:45,970
I would not, I would not, but I just want
to say that we were slapping the table.

1388
01:23:46,030 --> 01:23:49,990
We were fucking hell. And me and Norton
and we were looking over it, the laughing,

1389
01:23:50,010 --> 01:23:53,650
it was such a special moment,
like as comics, you know,

1390
01:23:53,680 --> 01:23:58,660
as professionals who've been comics
for 20 plus years, the both of us,

1391
01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:00,610
we were laughing together. Like, you know,

1392
01:24:00,700 --> 01:24:03,970
it was like there's a brotherhood
and that's the best compliment.

1393
01:24:04,450 --> 01:24:07,840
I don't get along with most comics.
I don't think you do what you, the,

1394
01:24:08,260 --> 01:24:11,170
you know what I mean? I get along
with a lot of comics, you know,

1395
01:24:11,171 --> 01:24:14,320
I give you credit. The ones that I don't
get along with, it gets got ugly. No, no,

1396
01:24:14,321 --> 01:24:18,220
I know that. But I'm saying I just
don't because I don't feel camaraderie.

1397
01:24:18,221 --> 01:24:21,610
So when I'm around the few that I do love,
you know,

1398
01:24:21,611 --> 01:24:23,470
and you'll one of them now obviously,

1399
01:24:23,890 --> 01:24:28,570
and you know Norton for years and
Florentine. I think in your defense,

1400
01:24:28,870 --> 01:24:33,870
I think in your defense you got so fucking
big so quick that it's real hard for

1401
01:24:35,111 --> 01:24:38,930
you to relate to other
people. [inaudible] comedy.

1402
01:24:39,660 --> 01:24:40,310
You know when,

1403
01:24:40,310 --> 01:24:43,990
when somebody comes with me and then
my comics mean not about the comedy,

1404
01:24:43,991 --> 01:24:48,700
I'm in comics, I'm saying your, you
became so fucking huge so quick.

1405
01:24:48,970 --> 01:24:52,690
There's like this automatic resentment
that's going to come with it with a lot

1406
01:24:52,691 --> 01:24:57,640
of people. You went from being a
comic who you know was in with others.

1407
01:24:57,641 --> 01:24:58,120
You know,

1408
01:24:58,120 --> 01:25:02,470
there's steady stream of professional
comics to becoming the biggest comic in

1409
01:25:02,471 --> 01:25:07,471
the history of standup comedy insider
a few years and it just went boom,

1410
01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:12,130
and all of a sudden you're doing
evidence. But 27 years, it was 10 years.

1411
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:14,920
I'm sure it was a long time
and I'm sure it was hard,

1412
01:25:16,660 --> 01:25:18,370
but it also the, the, the,

1413
01:25:18,371 --> 01:25:23,080
the height hit so high that it was
impossible for people to not get jealous.

1414
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:26,740
I've watched a lot of people get creepy.
I was able to talk to you.

1415
01:25:27,010 --> 01:25:31,480
I'm not a jealous person. Okay.
That's what I mean. And Oh listen,

1416
01:25:31,481 --> 01:25:35,620
I am honored to be around people like
you and honored to be around people like

1417
01:25:35,621 --> 01:25:37,360
Don.
My rare I am.

1418
01:25:37,420 --> 01:25:40,900
I don't care how long I've been doing
comedy or how I'm confident that I know

1419
01:25:40,901 --> 01:25:43,570
how to do it, but I am always like, uh,

1420
01:25:43,690 --> 01:25:48,160
honored to be friends with Doug. Stan
hope. I love that I can call up Stan,

1421
01:25:48,190 --> 01:25:50,530
who I believe is one of the
greatest comedians of all time.

1422
01:25:50,531 --> 01:25:53,260
I can call them up and we'll shoot the
shit on the phone and we'd love it.

1423
01:25:53,261 --> 01:25:55,210
And Stan Hope said to me the
other day, he goes, you know what?

1424
01:25:55,211 --> 01:25:59,740
I could quit comedy, but I can never
quit comics. He goes, I could never quit.

1425
01:25:59,741 --> 01:26:01,540
He goes,
I fucking hang out with,

1426
01:26:01,630 --> 01:26:04,810
I've tried to hang out with
too many regular people. I
can't fucking do it. Well,

1427
01:26:04,811 --> 01:26:09,530
that is, that is the fun part because
we're all twisted in all different ways.

1428
01:26:09,531 --> 01:26:13,580
Joey Diaz is different than you.
Even if I text you late at night,

1429
01:26:13,790 --> 01:26:16,780
I know you getting the texts
cause you're up. Yeah. Yeah.

1430
01:26:16,790 --> 01:26:18,960
You take at four in the morning.
Let me tell you something.

1431
01:26:19,410 --> 01:26:22,790
Cool wheels like one 30 in the morning
and he goes and I got to get some sleep

1432
01:26:22,791 --> 01:26:25,550
cause I got to get up.
I'm like, you're a comic.

1433
01:26:25,910 --> 01:26:28,330
He's also a chef de time pool has.

1434
01:26:28,340 --> 01:26:33,330
But I'm saying Jake time it is. I
agree. You know what I mean? I love,

1435
01:26:33,620 --> 01:26:36,470
I love the night. That's what I
am. I am exactly the same way.

1436
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:39,530
That's when I do all my work. I don't, I
don't get anything done during the day.

1437
01:26:39,531 --> 01:26:43,580
My kids are up. They want
to play. There's, you know,
fucking something's going on.

1438
01:26:43,581 --> 01:26:46,670
There's noise. I can't concentrate
in my office during the day.

1439
01:26:46,850 --> 01:26:49,580
I play with my kids, I get my
workouts in, I do my bullshit.

1440
01:26:49,581 --> 01:26:53,630
But then when everyone's asleep, I do
it after Jujitsu. So I like to write,

1441
01:26:53,631 --> 01:26:57,080
I don't even come home till
11 and then from 11 on,

1442
01:26:57,110 --> 01:27:01,790
that's when I start to write saying if
a call it three you pick it up. Oh yeah.

1443
01:27:01,791 --> 01:27:05,030
That's when I called Opie and
Anthony [inaudible]. Anthony,

1444
01:27:05,031 --> 01:27:08,990
I only call when I'm awake. I'm awake all
night, which I need to do more often. I,

1445
01:27:09,060 --> 01:27:14,040
I fucking love those guys and hanging out
with Anthony and when we were in Vegas,

1446
01:27:14,330 --> 01:27:17,870
he just really reinforced how great he is.
I always know he's a great guy,

1447
01:27:17,871 --> 01:27:22,070
but I'd love the fact that we could
all pal around in a social setting. Oh,

1448
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:23,670
he's a brilliant,
brilliant oppression.

1449
01:27:24,440 --> 01:27:26,840
It's a lot of people don't realize is
there's a lot of really good impression.

1450
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:30,710
He's another guy always tell, why aren't
you doing stand up? Well, he sort of is.

1451
01:27:30,711 --> 01:27:34,460
When he does the, have you
seen his fucking awesome show
his show. Let me do this.

1452
01:27:34,461 --> 01:27:35,420
Let me just give him credit.

1453
01:27:35,660 --> 01:27:38,120
This is the reason why we're
doing this podcast today.

1454
01:27:38,121 --> 01:27:40,520
It's because the Anthony Kumina
mia from the opiate Anthony Show,

1455
01:27:40,730 --> 01:27:44,420
because Anthony Kumi has started doing
his own show called live from the

1456
01:27:44,421 --> 01:27:48,110
compound and live from the compound,
which he does on Ustream.

1457
01:27:48,380 --> 01:27:52,430
He does it in his house.
He has a fucking studio set up.

1458
01:27:52,550 --> 01:27:57,250
He spent like a quarter million dollars
with fucking green screens and he could

1459
01:27:57,251 --> 01:28:00,880
be like in front of the Colosseum in Rome.
He couldn't be in space.

1460
01:28:01,160 --> 01:28:03,830
It could be any professional desk.
And you know,

1461
01:28:03,831 --> 01:28:05,510
he used to do with these
chicks he was dating.

1462
01:28:05,511 --> 01:28:08,600
He would be running around with a
machine gun. It's singing songs,

1463
01:28:08,900 --> 01:28:13,670
playing air guitar with holding a
fucking [inaudible]. He's crazy.

1464
01:28:13,671 --> 01:28:18,620
He's a beautiful person. Can love him.
He's a gambling addict. He's crazy.

1465
01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:23,450
He's nuts. I love Anthony. He
loves to drink. He's a up to me.

1466
01:28:23,510 --> 01:28:26,890
He's a classic American character
and I don't get to kick.

1467
01:28:26,910 --> 01:28:28,100
I don't have to hang out with them enough.

1468
01:28:28,190 --> 01:28:32,930
So then all of a sudden we were in
Vegas together and steaks we went to Wa

1469
01:28:33,030 --> 01:28:36,710
craftsteak and had the most read
the fucking one thing about Vegas.

1470
01:28:36,711 --> 01:28:40,850
They know how to make them. Oh, bass
cliff stakes. Craftsteak is an MGM. Oh,

1471
01:28:40,851 --> 01:28:44,810
it's got damn good.
Oh the best though.

1472
01:28:44,840 --> 01:28:49,340
The best is nine nine steak house in the
palm. You can't fuck with that place.

1473
01:28:49,730 --> 01:28:52,730
You get the grass fed rib eye do not pass.
Go.

1474
01:28:53,090 --> 01:28:57,620
You want the grass fed rib by medium rare,
it will knock your Dick into the dirt.

1475
01:28:57,950 --> 01:29:01,410
It's the most spectacular
cut of meat available in the,

1476
01:29:01,411 --> 01:29:05,670
probably in the entire western part of
the United States. That nine steakhouse,

1477
01:29:05,700 --> 01:29:09,450
nine steak house in Vegas
and the point there, k a lot,

1478
01:29:09,451 --> 01:29:12,330
so we went to crab steak. Yeah, I've
been there too. Okay, that's great.

1479
01:29:12,510 --> 01:29:16,530
We went to crab steak. We had a great
meal. We had some wine. Anthony was like,

1480
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:21,030
he knows wine, so he picked out a good
wine. It was me and my, my buddy Steve,

1481
01:29:21,060 --> 01:29:24,750
who I've known since I was like 15 it was
all of us as big group who came to see

1482
01:29:24,751 --> 01:29:29,010
you. It was such a thrill. It
was so fun to just see a show.

1483
01:29:29,011 --> 01:29:33,520
Why didn't I get to go, Joe,
you what? Puff. Oh Man. Oh

1484
01:29:36,860 --> 01:29:40,350
Hey. We had such a great time. We
walked in right when Max was playing.

1485
01:29:40,470 --> 01:29:44,820
We walked in and how great Max was
having a guitar solo or excuse me,

1486
01:29:44,821 --> 01:29:47,100
a drum solo. You know you, you know what?

1487
01:29:47,330 --> 01:29:50,610
You got to talk to them about that for
a minute because drum solo was fucking

1488
01:29:50,611 --> 01:29:54,270
spectacular. Serious hand
eye coordination, son,

1489
01:29:54,271 --> 01:29:55,950
you went off that was like real shit.

1490
01:29:56,100 --> 01:30:00,300
You didn't like have like a halfass drum
solo. You were fucking fly in a man.

1491
01:30:00,540 --> 01:30:02,940
The kid was flying.
Unbelievable.

1492
01:30:04,210 --> 01:30:07,950
It's what he needs to hear now
because you know you can do that shit.

1493
01:30:08,970 --> 01:30:12,560
That's them. We get to here at
the Improv. Did we get to hear it?

1494
01:30:14,100 --> 01:30:14,933
Wow

1495
01:31:01,010 --> 01:31:01,843
down.

1496
01:31:26,900 --> 01:31:27,733
Okay.

1497
01:31:40,700 --> 01:31:42,210
You need to see that someone,

1498
01:31:42,270 --> 01:31:46,370

little part of this video on youtube.

1499
01:31:46,371 --> 01:31:49,310
You have to see that with him
watching it in the corner.

1500
01:31:52,190 --> 01:31:55,190
He's walking around in the house going,
I think, you know, cause don't forget it,

1501
01:31:55,200 --> 01:31:59,820
showtime. You know what I mean? And this
is the band's first shot ever. Yeah.

1502
01:31:59,950 --> 01:32:03,070
You know, doing the song you
saw could outlaw and he's gone.

1503
01:32:03,100 --> 01:32:04,780
I don't know if the Solos they yet,

1504
01:32:04,781 --> 01:32:08,710
and I'm trying to explain every night
we'd sit outside the house and I go, Max,

1505
01:32:08,980 --> 01:32:13,980
there is nothing you have to learn for
this solo because you have such chops.

1506
01:32:14,501 --> 01:32:17,480
Like I, you know, I started out
as a drummer, but my ability,

1507
01:32:17,481 --> 01:32:22,180
it doesn't come close to what he can do
that. So yeah, I get jealous of his feet.

1508
01:32:22,181 --> 01:32:27,090
All the combinations.
No, because because he's,

1509
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:32,230
he uses both his feet like his hand,
he drive a stick shift. It's automatic.

1510
01:32:32,830 --> 01:32:34,480
Automatic.
I feel it.

1511
01:32:34,481 --> 01:32:37,270
God knows how to work the pedals like
that would want to fucking stick shifts.

1512
01:32:37,300 --> 01:32:41,740
No, no. He's just amazing. And like when
I would tell people about him, you know,

1513
01:32:41,741 --> 01:32:44,680
I'm the farthest, so they think,
well how good can they really be?

1514
01:32:45,070 --> 01:32:48,640
And then you see that which, which
we got to see it. You got to see,

1515
01:32:48,641 --> 01:32:52,050
it's like babysit. Yeah. You got to
listen. You're listening to it folks. You,

1516
01:32:52,051 --> 01:32:55,670
if you're hearing just the audio
version of this podcast, it's like a,

1517
01:32:56,020 --> 01:32:59,260
it's an iPhone camera. So the,
the sound quality is not the best.

1518
01:32:59,410 --> 01:33:02,310
You have to see it. If you see it, it's
fucking propositive. When he would,

1519
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:05,590
when he would show me like
drum Solos Chicago, like

1520
01:33:08,360 --> 01:33:12,310
I said at the Arcadia, right.
Arcadia theater in Chicago. Well,

1521
01:33:12,311 --> 01:33:14,320
I'm going to be 22 and uh,
with the,

1522
01:33:14,321 --> 01:33:18,580
so I actually started off only soloing
when I first started playing the drums.

1523
01:33:18,581 --> 01:33:20,590
I didn't play with a band
for like the first five,

1524
01:33:20,591 --> 01:33:23,080
six years of drumming he's
playing since he's 10.

1525
01:33:23,130 --> 01:33:26,560
And how old are you now going to be 22
you're going to be 22 she'd been playing

1526
01:33:26,561 --> 01:33:31,030
the drums for 12 years. Dude, your
fucking hands are ridiculously fast.

1527
01:33:31,480 --> 01:33:33,040
You should get involved in wing Chung.

1528
01:33:34,270 --> 01:33:37,600
You should start coming through
and mother fuckers that fast speed.

1529
01:33:37,750 --> 01:33:41,710
He could probably be a hell of a bargain.
Talk. Believe it translates number one.

1530
01:33:41,711 --> 01:33:45,850
He can box. I'm embarrassed
to say he, he, he, no,

1531
01:33:45,851 --> 01:33:50,240
by accident he sorta
knocked me out twice because

1532
01:33:52,130 --> 01:33:56,300
when I would, you know, teach them to
box, you know, I would say, you know,

1533
01:33:56,320 --> 01:34:00,420
we've got an that Hollywood gym that
had his love, that place. I would say,

1534
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:02,320
all right,
no head shots at all.

1535
01:34:02,321 --> 01:34:05,800
So I would just protect my body
and let them fight me, both kid.

1536
01:34:06,130 --> 01:34:10,240
So now and then Max would slip and he'd
nailed me right on the chin once it

1537
01:34:10,241 --> 01:34:12,970
happened in my backyard
and I went right down.

1538
01:34:12,971 --> 01:34:16,150
Because you know when you hit in the chin,
you see the stars and you've got down.

1539
01:34:16,390 --> 01:34:21,120
I'm not expecting to get punched in
the face by my friend unless you yeah,

1540
01:34:21,150 --> 01:34:21,983
by my son.

1541
01:34:22,030 --> 01:34:25,810
And then he does it again at the gym
and I'm on the floor feeling like an

1542
01:34:25,870 --> 01:34:27,970
asshole because here I am,

1543
01:34:27,971 --> 01:34:31,600
I'm the father and my 14 year old
just knocked me out. Well, you know,

1544
01:34:31,601 --> 01:34:34,390
the reality is there's a lot of chicks
that can knock you out if they don't know.

1545
01:34:34,391 --> 01:34:37,060
If you don't know the punch in you, if
you don't know they're going to punch you.

1546
01:34:37,060 --> 01:34:39,580
There's a great video of a chick
headbutting a guy on conscious,

1547
01:34:39,700 --> 01:34:43,630
some asshole at a bar says
something stupid toy. She
grabs his shirt, goes bang,

1548
01:34:43,960 --> 01:34:47,860
knocked some completely unconscious,
and that does work. That doesn't work.

1549
01:34:47,861 --> 01:34:50,110
Let me tell you,
he hit me with his fist.

1550
01:34:50,290 --> 01:34:53,650
I'm saying a little girl can
headbutt a jet giant dude.

1551
01:34:53,830 --> 01:34:56,890
What I'm saying is if you don't know
it's coming, if you get hit in the jaw,

1552
01:34:56,891 --> 01:34:59,450
you can get,
that's even by a little girl's head.

1553
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:04,250
Well that's what I tried to break the
body down first and then they go for the

1554
01:35:04,251 --> 01:35:07,430
chin. It's not a bad because people, when
they see a professional fight they go,

1555
01:35:07,640 --> 01:35:11,300
why aren't they just swinging it up?
They don't realize it's a skill.

1556
01:35:11,301 --> 01:35:14,210
It's a dance. It's, you'd be amazed
at how hard it is to hit someone.

1557
01:35:14,240 --> 01:35:18,050
Did you ever do an actual box and kickbox
I did a lot of boxing in the gym but I

1558
01:35:18,051 --> 01:35:19,910
have three kickboxing fights.
But it,

1559
01:35:19,911 --> 01:35:23,840
you'd be amazed at how difficult it is
to actually hit someone who knows how to

1560
01:35:23,841 --> 01:35:28,160
box. It's, it's a dance. It's a rhythm.
You got to figure out how to fucking,

1561
01:35:28,161 --> 01:35:30,160
how to fake them,
how to get them to move out,

1562
01:35:30,350 --> 01:35:34,870
when to run and cause if you run in
like if you see Ryan Bader versus Leo

1563
01:35:34,870 --> 01:35:35,080
Machida,

1564
01:35:35,080 --> 01:35:38,310
the Oda Cheetahs is bad ass karate guy
and he'd knocked Ryan Bader out cause

1565
01:35:38,311 --> 01:35:42,050
Bader charge them. They just caught
them charging and flatten them,

1566
01:35:42,051 --> 01:35:45,230
knocked them out with one punch,
but you, that's the risk you take.

1567
01:35:45,231 --> 01:35:46,310
If you want to be aggressive,

1568
01:35:46,460 --> 01:35:50,360
it's so hard to hit someone who actually
knows how to fight. It's riddance.

1569
01:35:50,750 --> 01:35:54,320
You will feel if you were like, there's
a lot of people that always bothers me.

1570
01:35:54,830 --> 01:35:59,810
Peterson Center fight. He's a great guy
to level. Want to know more about boxing?

1571
01:35:59,811 --> 01:36:04,570
They should get in touch with me.
[inaudible] we don't dice clay on Twitter.

1572
01:36:04,630 --> 01:36:08,960
Is that my Twitter things? Real dice
clay. If you want to know about drumming,

1573
01:36:09,470 --> 01:36:14,470
met Max does comedy and if you
want to go out with Eleanor Max,

1574
01:36:14,781 --> 01:36:18,920
did you get upset when you dropped your
dad? I was a, I was nervous. You know,

1575
01:36:18,921 --> 01:36:22,210
I came over like, you know, are you
okay? I didn't mean to do it. Oh yeah,

1576
01:36:22,211 --> 01:36:23,310
he show you didn't mean it,

1577
01:36:24,860 --> 01:36:29,160
but it was thinking about maybe that it
was major. We have a great relationship,

1578
01:36:29,860 --> 01:36:33,140
you know, you know well that means
probably got a good punch. Look,

1579
01:36:33,141 --> 01:36:36,530
if you hit the drum set hard, I bet you
can generate some serious fucking speed.

1580
01:36:36,531 --> 01:36:40,320
If somebody teaches mechanics,
oh,

1581
01:36:40,370 --> 01:36:43,220
you can't hit your kids.
That's ridiculous. You know,

1582
01:36:43,221 --> 01:36:45,690
I'm just handing you over to
rogue and for all your fights,

1583
01:36:47,240 --> 01:36:50,480
thinking about taking some crop
McGaugh so chroma guys good. Yeah,

1584
01:36:50,481 --> 01:36:53,330
it's interesting, you
know, but uh, there's uh,

1585
01:36:53,390 --> 01:36:57,970
but he knows miss a lot of benefits to
taking one martial art over a common

1586
01:36:57,971 --> 01:36:59,240
atory system of martial arts.

1587
01:36:59,420 --> 01:37:01,940
Like a lot of people think the common
atory systems like [inaudible] or

1588
01:37:01,941 --> 01:37:04,970
something like that is good if you don't,
we do it every now and then.

1589
01:37:04,971 --> 01:37:06,560
You just want to learn some self defense.

1590
01:37:06,980 --> 01:37:10,910
But I think there's a lot of time spent
doing shit like street techniques and

1591
01:37:10,911 --> 01:37:14,510
stuff like that. That's really not really
coming up. No, I don't think you do.

1592
01:37:14,540 --> 01:37:16,400
You really don't want to know.
You really want to know.

1593
01:37:16,600 --> 01:37:19,700
We really want to be good at
what works on trained killers,

1594
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,340
not people in the street
with a fucking set of keys.

1595
01:37:22,341 --> 01:37:23,750
Because in a real life situation,

1596
01:37:23,751 --> 01:37:25,400
there's going to be a lot
of craziness going on.

1597
01:37:25,610 --> 01:37:30,320
You gotta be able to execute from memory
and from training and how much training

1598
01:37:30,321 --> 01:37:32,860
are you really have taken? Someone's going
away. I mean, are you really good at,

1599
01:37:33,050 --> 01:37:33,320
I mean,

1600
01:37:33,320 --> 01:37:36,050
maybe it's a good thing to know if you're
in the special forces or something and

1601
01:37:36,051 --> 01:37:38,450
you got to learn, you know, dealing
with people with hand guns all the time.

1602
01:37:38,630 --> 01:37:41,660
But the reality of self defense is
most of the times when things happen,

1603
01:37:41,810 --> 01:37:44,390
they happen one because
one person's not confident,

1604
01:37:44,391 --> 01:37:46,220
so the other person gets cocky.
And two,

1605
01:37:46,221 --> 01:37:48,860
because you're not aware of your
environment and you don't have enough

1606
01:37:48,861 --> 01:37:50,930
confidence in any one
particular discipline,

1607
01:37:50,931 --> 01:37:53,240
whether it's stand up or the ground
fighting or anything like that.

1608
01:37:53,420 --> 01:37:56,010
A lot of people want to fight and they
don't know how fight. And it scares

1609
01:37:56,010 --> 01:37:58,650
the shit out of me.
I've been a martial artist my whole life.

1610
01:37:58,680 --> 01:38:01,170
The last thing I want to do is get in
a fight with somebody because I know

1611
01:38:01,171 --> 01:38:04,080
there's some people that can do some
crazy shit to your body. Yeah, okay.

1612
01:38:04,081 --> 01:38:08,370
I know them. I know people who could eat.
You would be crazy to fight them. Yeah,

1613
01:38:08,460 --> 01:38:12,870
but people start fights with them because
there's a lot of fucking morons out

1614
01:38:12,871 --> 01:38:15,180
there, but I want to, for me,

1615
01:38:15,210 --> 01:38:20,210
it's very important that I'm the one who
is capable of deciding where everything

1616
01:38:20,791 --> 01:38:21,480
goes.

1617
01:38:21,480 --> 01:38:25,560
I don't like being in a position where
I have to trust my health to some crazy

1618
01:38:25,570 --> 01:38:27,570
asshole, you know? I don't like that.

1619
01:38:27,571 --> 01:38:30,060
I don't like the to know that some
guy could just own me anytime.

1620
01:38:30,061 --> 01:38:32,730
He wants to just jump all over me and I
don't know what to do and I can't even

1621
01:38:32,731 --> 01:38:35,520
defend myself. I can't live like
that. That would drive me crazy.

1622
01:38:35,521 --> 01:38:37,800
I know too many crazy people,
you know?

1623
01:38:37,801 --> 01:38:41,880
I grew up with too many complete fucking
psychopaths to ever think that it's

1624
01:38:41,881 --> 01:38:43,620
safe to not know how to defend yourself.

1625
01:38:43,790 --> 01:38:48,490
Yeah, I agree with that. Yeah. It's like
if you, I know how to defend myself. Oh,

1626
01:38:49,060 --> 01:38:51,100
I know you said mock wrestling
matches in the backseat.

1627
01:38:51,850 --> 01:38:55,640
Nearly beat up people at
shows that's ever get some,

1628
01:38:55,820 --> 01:38:59,480
some situations like what
is this one girl we went to,

1629
01:39:00,050 --> 01:39:03,590
we went out to this club and normally
it's a Sunday night. You remember this?

1630
01:39:03,650 --> 01:39:07,070
It was a Sunday night and it's usually
dead. Andrew's like, oh, I always go here.

1631
01:39:07,071 --> 01:39:09,830
It's usually like a hundred people.
It's not that bad. We get there.

1632
01:39:09,831 --> 01:39:12,740
There was some kind of dead
mouse DJ thing going on. Okay.

1633
01:39:13,420 --> 01:39:17,120
There was like 1500 people.
Yeah. Ran Pack. And I go,

1634
01:39:17,121 --> 01:39:19,940
here's where we can't go in here. And he
goes, no, we'll be fine. We'll be fine.

1635
01:39:20,240 --> 01:39:22,090
Girls were throwing themselves at him.

1636
01:39:25,680 --> 01:39:30,510
Nice. That must be nice.
Yeah, it feels good.

1637
01:39:30,511 --> 01:39:33,650
But you know how fast did I
take that girl off? Yeah. Yeah.

1638
01:39:33,660 --> 01:39:37,860
But how does she does she does security
when we go out? Yeah. He gets crazy.

1639
01:39:37,861 --> 01:39:42,740
He goes crazy. Yeah. No, it feels good.
But you know what? It's, you know, it's,

1640
01:39:42,741 --> 01:39:46,860
it's nothing I'm looking for, you
know what I mean? No, I'm serious.

1641
01:39:47,420 --> 01:39:49,890
Even when I'm single.
You know what I mean?

1642
01:39:49,891 --> 01:39:54,180
It's nothing that's ever thrilled me
unless I'm out hunting, I believe,

1643
01:39:54,380 --> 01:39:56,280
but that's strolling into a club.

1644
01:39:56,310 --> 01:39:59,680
Fill with 1500 people with those
sunglasses on and a sleeveless shirt and,

1645
01:39:59,681 --> 01:40:03,380
and the throwing themselves out. You'll
come on, sorry. You're in a goddamn movie,

1646
01:40:03,610 --> 01:40:04,690
you're going to Goddamn man.

1647
01:40:04,700 --> 01:40:08,580
I appreciate it cause sometimes
it does hit me in that way.

1648
01:40:08,610 --> 01:40:12,720
What do you get to live that life?
But I really appreciate your famous guy.

1649
01:40:12,720 --> 01:40:14,340
You've got to clubs,
you go out.

1650
01:40:15,770 --> 01:40:20,740
I mostly do shows after shows. I it's,
it's hard to go places, you know, it's,

1651
01:40:20,741 --> 01:40:24,780
it's, it's very rare that he
does it. But you know what,

1652
01:40:24,781 --> 01:40:28,470
I like to dance with my wife
sometimes, you know, and you know,

1653
01:40:28,471 --> 01:40:31,380
I'm very focused on her when I
go out because they see all the,

1654
01:40:31,650 --> 01:40:33,660
I'm watching the guys watching her.

1655
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:36,930
But when you do allow you
to have a problem with like
people constantly wanting

1656
01:40:36,931 --> 01:40:39,570
to get your attention to take photos.
Like they never give me just,

1657
01:40:39,800 --> 01:40:42,060
they normally put me in
one of those VIP booths.

1658
01:40:42,570 --> 01:40:45,420
She stands there with her arms out,
like touching the boots.

1659
01:40:45,421 --> 01:40:50,010
Like she's just hanging out and
she won't let anybody put big,

1660
01:40:50,100 --> 01:40:53,890
this was funny when we went out
a Halloween, then we went to

1661
01:40:54,160 --> 01:40:56,620
the same club.
I think a true,

1662
01:40:57,480 --> 01:40:59,950
but that was later and they had,

1663
01:40:59,980 --> 01:41:04,330
I'm dancing with my wife on the dance
floor and you've got these three giants,

1664
01:41:04,510 --> 01:41:08,110
these three guys surrounding
us so we can dance.

1665
01:41:08,111 --> 01:41:10,360
So people didn't bother me,
you know,

1666
01:41:10,361 --> 01:41:13,370
and you just have to ignore it and
you get into the person you with.

1667
01:41:14,410 --> 01:41:16,460
We went to this crazy place first.

1668
01:41:16,461 --> 01:41:19,150
There was one that was like 10,000
people at that first place. Yeah,

1669
01:41:19,220 --> 01:41:22,300
we saw a fight. This shit. We saw
a lot of fights there. We went to,

1670
01:41:22,301 --> 01:41:26,640
that's when I felt, oh you want to
hear what's the finish fetish ball.

1671
01:41:26,650 --> 01:41:27,483
That's right Max.

1672
01:41:27,730 --> 01:41:32,730
If people thought he was dressed as
Andrew dice clay and they were like funny

1673
01:41:33,670 --> 01:41:37,600
where I had a hit somebody,
you could tell it,

1674
01:41:38,230 --> 01:41:42,340
I don't remember the name of the hotel
or where we were. It was the south,

1675
01:41:42,341 --> 01:41:45,990
something down near the hotel
around the south coast. Oh No.

1676
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:50,200
But we were walking out and we're walking
fast because people are recognizing

1677
01:41:50,201 --> 01:41:55,090
them a thinking. He's just stressed. And
when people yell my name, I'm not him,

1678
01:41:55,091 --> 01:41:57,970
I just keep going. Right.
So all of a sudden this guy,

1679
01:41:57,971 --> 01:42:02,500
me and Valerie were in heels, so he was
walking fast, like 30 feet behind me,

1680
01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:07,060
a little bit ahead of us. So I hear this
guy go dice, dice and I'm like, Oh shit.

1681
01:42:09,610 --> 01:42:14,290
And he comes over and I, I we wreck.
No, like don't touch me. You know,

1682
01:42:14,291 --> 01:42:17,080
he touched him like this and
he knocked him the fuck out.

1683
01:42:17,350 --> 01:42:20,110
It was his friend brand.
It's a friend of mine,

1684
01:42:20,111 --> 01:42:23,590
but I didn't see him
coming and I just felt no,

1685
01:42:23,591 --> 01:42:28,270
I didn't see him and his hands grabbed my
shoulder so I just react and I hit him,

1686
01:42:28,660 --> 01:42:32,080
you know, because that's where the gloves
are off once you put your hands on me.

1687
01:42:32,081 --> 01:42:35,230
Hard like that. But he's my
friend, but they're yelling. No,

1688
01:42:35,231 --> 01:42:38,250
if he was yelling Andrew, I wasn't
just look Brandon, but he couldn't,

1689
01:42:38,350 --> 01:42:38,741
I didn't know.

1690
01:42:38,741 --> 01:42:42,910
It's my friend and I turned and he's
going back and he's out on his feet,

1691
01:42:43,510 --> 01:42:48,120
you know, cause I do know how to
hit, you know, in that way. Right.

1692
01:42:48,130 --> 01:42:51,080
Brandon's punch him in the head,
but it was,

1693
01:42:51,670 --> 01:42:55,990
but I hit him with a side punch. I didn't
hit her. I was turning to hit him again.

1694
01:42:56,140 --> 01:42:59,650
And that's when I saw
was and I felt so bad.

1695
01:42:59,651 --> 01:43:03,820
And to this day he won't admit that
he was out. It's just funny, you know,

1696
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:08,410
I'm like, Shit. I'm like, Yo, I, you
know, how do you yell my name? You know,

1697
01:43:08,411 --> 01:43:12,360
you don't yell my name. That's like, you
don't say dice. You say Andrew, you know,

1698
01:43:12,400 --> 01:43:16,150
cause it, it's like a drunk gut. This
is what I'm picking up weight, Joe.

1699
01:43:16,151 --> 01:43:20,260
This is what I'm picking up. I'm
hearing a guy yell, dice, dice,

1700
01:43:20,261 --> 01:43:24,520
and all of a sudden I feel this two
hands grabbing revenue like that.

1701
01:43:24,521 --> 01:43:27,790
So I just fucking bang
the guy and he's gotten,

1702
01:43:27,791 --> 01:43:30,850
now I'm turning around to
really finish them because once,

1703
01:43:30,851 --> 01:43:33,960
and I'm sure you know you would react
the same as somebody's got to be careful.

1704
01:43:33,970 --> 01:43:38,160
Just grabbing you can do that.
You never know if I,

1705
01:43:38,170 --> 01:43:39,860
if I feel someone grabbing me from behind,

1706
01:43:39,870 --> 01:43:44,740
I feel like they're up to
nefarious things. Well you
grab me. I gotta do to make,

1707
01:43:45,360 --> 01:43:48,690
you know, that's the one
thing I don't have in place.

1708
01:43:50,870 --> 01:43:52,070
What, what? Sorry.

1709
01:43:52,280 --> 01:43:55,160
Sorry. Okay. It's all right. Yeah,
it's crazy that someone would,

1710
01:43:55,161 --> 01:43:58,940
why wouldn't he just, we'll just
touch us. He was, he was, hey buddy,

1711
01:43:58,970 --> 01:43:59,810
you don't understand.

1712
01:43:59,811 --> 01:44:04,700
He was drinking so he got excited when
he saw the Commodore Hotel did 30 feet

1713
01:44:04,701 --> 01:44:07,490
behind me. Fucking problem. The drunks.

1714
01:44:07,550 --> 01:44:10,300
That is a problem with people that don't
even realize that it might take you a

1715
01:44:10,310 --> 01:44:12,890
lot of the shows, they don't even
realize they're being ridiculous.

1716
01:44:12,980 --> 01:44:17,390
It's a terrible drug for, for socializing.
It's the best jug for socializing,

1717
01:44:17,570 --> 01:44:18,770
but it requires character.

1718
01:44:18,790 --> 01:44:21,740
But there's so many people don't have
character and they go out and they drink

1719
01:44:21,741 --> 01:44:24,850
and they're real shitbag personality
comes flying out. Hey look,

1720
01:44:24,890 --> 01:44:28,430
if you come over to me for a picture
and you're not drunk and you're nice,

1721
01:44:28,431 --> 01:44:30,980
I'll take, I'll take a dozen
of them. What do you do though?

1722
01:44:30,981 --> 01:44:34,700
If you're on your way to somewhere and
you just said is a river of people and

1723
01:44:34,701 --> 01:44:38,270
you can't get thrown. Well if it, if
it's nice people, I'll take the shots.

1724
01:44:38,271 --> 01:44:43,250
But if they're assholes, they put
their hands on me. I don't have a fuse,

1725
01:44:43,670 --> 01:44:45,860
I just don't have a fuse
and I won't deal with it.

1726
01:44:45,870 --> 01:44:50,640
He did something cool. Uh, last Sunday
at our show in Vegas, he, uh, some guy,

1727
01:44:50,641 --> 01:44:53,190
he was coming up the elevator and he
was kind of late and the guy was like,

1728
01:44:53,191 --> 01:44:54,690
hey man, I saw you at
Madison Square. Yeah.

1729
01:44:54,940 --> 01:44:58,030
This guy went to both shows at the garden
when I was still alive. And he was,

1730
01:44:58,031 --> 01:44:58,880
and I was in a rush.

1731
01:44:59,070 --> 01:45:03,950
Say it. Wow was after his Doring his
shell, like at the end of it he goes,

1732
01:45:03,951 --> 01:45:05,870
who's the guy in the elevator?
And the guy was like,

1733
01:45:05,871 --> 01:45:07,540
that was me any talking
about on stage and took it.

1734
01:45:07,930 --> 01:45:09,010
I took him on the stage.

1735
01:45:09,870 --> 01:45:13,690
He was so excited that like a
Chinaman to take the pictures.

1736
01:45:13,691 --> 01:45:18,160
Cause I know they make the cameras,
you know what I mean? Oh No, no,

1737
01:45:18,370 --> 01:45:20,200
they do, they know what they're
doing with it, you know,

1738
01:45:20,201 --> 01:45:23,730
and they were right in front of me
and I actually dedicated like my,

1739
01:45:23,731 --> 01:45:28,330
my Asian obit to them, you know, cause
they were dead center. That's beautiful.

1740
01:45:28,600 --> 01:45:33,190
I don't know what they knew what they
were getting, but they were cool about it,

1741
01:45:33,191 --> 01:45:37,900
you know. And I, I gave him some
suggestions for, for new phones and um,

1742
01:45:38,550 --> 01:45:42,460
but I brought the guy up from the
crowd because I was in a rush.

1743
01:45:42,461 --> 01:45:44,590
I was late for the show,
so I'm going,

1744
01:45:44,591 --> 01:45:47,740
who's the guy that was at the God and
stand up, you know, that's very cool.

1745
01:45:47,770 --> 01:45:50,890
Come on up. Let's take a couple pictures.
And of course I had fun with them,

1746
01:45:50,891 --> 01:45:51,990
but we do our show.

1747
01:45:51,991 --> 01:45:56,430
I felt bad that I had a blow him off when
I was coming up the stairs. You know,

1748
01:45:56,500 --> 01:45:59,580
we do our shows and then we hang on
after the show and take pictures with

1749
01:45:59,581 --> 01:46:02,930
everybody. But if I'm on a rush
to get somewhere that's that's,

1750
01:46:03,070 --> 01:46:04,870
that's when it becomes
a problem like in Vegas,

1751
01:46:04,871 --> 01:46:07,960
like after the UFC is it becomes a real
problem because there'll be a thousand

1752
01:46:07,961 --> 01:46:10,330
people waiting in line. I'm like,
folks, I can, I got gotta go,

1753
01:46:10,331 --> 01:46:13,310
I'm a meeting my friend and then they
got the ones and they get pissed off and

1754
01:46:13,311 --> 01:46:17,130
be like, yeah, I wrote something about
me on Facebook. See where we're at today.

1755
01:46:17,140 --> 01:46:20,560
Concern yourself because no,
I mean a guy and I don't like,

1756
01:46:20,590 --> 01:46:23,740
I don't like to blow somebody off if
they're legitimately happy to see me. No,

1757
01:46:23,741 --> 01:46:26,560
but you know what a thousand people
you see, it's really fucking hard

1758
01:46:28,060 --> 01:46:31,480
when somebody goes dice where you'd
take a picture and all of a sudden the

1759
01:46:31,481 --> 01:46:34,780
friend standing, I go, well how
long does it take to take? Oh, oh,

1760
01:46:34,781 --> 01:46:38,370
it was on the filming by accident.
That's what I got pictures over.

1761
01:46:38,860 --> 01:46:41,640
You know what I mean? Get the fuck
Outta here. You know what I mean?

1762
01:46:41,641 --> 01:46:42,610
You look at their fans,

1763
01:46:42,990 --> 01:46:47,110
I don't give a fuck who they are if you
want to get it right. Take a picture. No,

1764
01:46:47,111 --> 01:46:50,020
they do it on purpose. We do the
filming. Yeah. Cause you know and then,

1765
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:52,650
oh they have more time. We
know. You know how many t no,

1766
01:46:52,651 --> 01:46:54,690
to get their little
piece of fucking footage.

1767
01:46:54,691 --> 01:46:56,460
I can't take it with the phones no more.

1768
01:46:56,650 --> 01:46:59,030
The guy puts it on the low
online all the time, right?

1769
01:46:59,110 --> 01:47:03,100
Yeah. It's like, you know what? Take
the picture. It's a nice man. I get it,

1770
01:47:03,370 --> 01:47:07,540
but don't start with being Scorsese and
doing a fucking feature film with me.

1771
01:47:07,740 --> 01:47:08,573
The guy got,

1772
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:11,250
he was like, you don't want you, you
don't want to be up on youtube. I'm like,

1773
01:47:11,251 --> 01:47:15,660
not by, you got no luck in this
whole human being. Me and Valerie.

1774
01:47:15,720 --> 01:47:19,140
And he was like, and he would put it
up. This is dice his wife. Oh Geez.

1775
01:47:19,141 --> 01:47:23,670
Well creepy. You know what it like
when you were in the public eye. I try

1776
01:47:23,670 --> 01:47:27,740
to be as cool as I can with people. But
then you get the ASL when you're doing,

1777
01:47:27,770 --> 01:47:28,181
like I,

1778
01:47:28,181 --> 01:47:31,970
I really refused to do most meet and
greets because there's always going to be

1779
01:47:31,971 --> 01:47:34,540
the guy that wants to put
me in a headlock. Yeah.

1780
01:47:34,580 --> 01:47:37,190
And he's always going to regret it.
And I don't care who it is.

1781
01:47:37,250 --> 01:47:40,850
Why did the dude's like to do
that? Because you know, like, look,

1782
01:47:40,851 --> 01:47:43,760
you can add are a guy like me.
You got an attitude about yourself.

1783
01:47:43,780 --> 01:47:45,500
You've got a tough image about yourself.

1784
01:47:45,650 --> 01:47:48,230
So they want to challenge
you in front of their check.

1785
01:47:48,470 --> 01:47:52,280
If they get to meet you instead of
being cool and taking the picture,

1786
01:47:52,520 --> 01:47:56,180
they want to out macho you. And that's
where, and I don't care who it is,

1787
01:47:56,420 --> 01:48:00,110
I don't care if he's fucking Zillow.
You're going to pay the price for that.

1788
01:48:00,830 --> 01:48:03,560
And right in front of you checked.
I don't care if I am Babish you,

1789
01:48:03,561 --> 01:48:06,830
I don't care how big you are.
I have no fucking fear of it.

1790
01:48:06,831 --> 01:48:09,890
How many times you've been in fist
fights because of that? Uh, I, I've,

1791
01:48:09,891 --> 01:48:13,280
I've had enough problems.
I've been sued enough and you know,

1792
01:48:13,910 --> 01:48:15,980
but now that those things are pass me,

1793
01:48:15,981 --> 01:48:19,870
I could move on to the next group
of fights. It is hot. It is hard to,

1794
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,510
to just see.
I used to run around.

1795
01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:26,180
That's why I would laugh when I would
see you like flipping out on people cause

1796
01:48:26,181 --> 01:48:26,631
some going,

1797
01:48:26,631 --> 01:48:31,160
thank God there's somebody else in the
business that has no fucking patience for

1798
01:48:31,161 --> 01:48:35,750
these assholes and this is a guy that'll
follow people out and go home with them

1799
01:48:35,751 --> 01:48:38,700
and argue with them.
Loved that about,

1800
01:48:39,080 --> 01:48:42,320
because I didn't know you
the way I came to know you.

1801
01:48:42,710 --> 01:48:46,340
I'm coming in the comedy store one night
and I hear that from the mic and the

1802
01:48:46,341 --> 01:48:49,940
stage just guide. Just you were bearing
someone, you weren't doing a bit,

1803
01:48:50,210 --> 01:48:55,190
you will on somebody that you just didn't
like. It was, it was Joe Rogan mean.

1804
01:48:55,230 --> 01:49:00,080
Oh. And I just loved it seeing
somebody get fucking buried,

1805
01:49:00,440 --> 01:49:02,480
you know,
cause you weren't trying to be clever.

1806
01:49:02,690 --> 01:49:04,730
You weren't trying to
be funny at that part.

1807
01:49:04,940 --> 01:49:09,230
You wanted to dismantle this
person piece by fucking piece.

1808
01:49:09,620 --> 01:49:12,470
And I was just so happy and enjoyed it.

1809
01:49:12,471 --> 01:49:16,250
Like I was hearing the funniest stuff
ever. And then when you were done,

1810
01:49:16,251 --> 01:49:19,500
you got back into the act and you kept
screaming about whatever you with,

1811
01:49:19,740 --> 01:49:21,860
you know your bits and about,
you know,

1812
01:49:21,861 --> 01:49:26,300
you know fucking this chick and you know,
and and I enjoyed that too.

1813
01:49:26,990 --> 01:49:31,990
But to walk into a place and just see
somebody so fucking angry and I never met

1814
01:49:33,381 --> 01:49:34,790
you.
I never saw you on stage.

1815
01:49:34,791 --> 01:49:39,350
And this was my first experience with
you that I had to sit down and watch and

1816
01:49:39,351 --> 01:49:41,570
just laugh.
Oh thank going.

1817
01:49:41,571 --> 01:49:46,571
This guy is just enjoying
destroying this guy with his and,

1818
01:49:48,030 --> 01:49:49,450
and I knew the guy deserved it.

1819
01:49:49,480 --> 01:49:54,400
Well there were so many ass cause he was
fuck you too. That was his big comeback.

1820
01:49:54,430 --> 01:49:58,360
They had fucked me too.
You want to tell me that outside?

1821
01:49:58,361 --> 01:50:01,060
You mother fucker.
You want to be a big shot.

1822
01:50:01,061 --> 01:50:03,280
You went into the whole
fucking thing and I was like,

1823
01:50:03,850 --> 01:50:08,710
oh what a breath of fresh air. There
was no one that would monitor the room,

1824
01:50:09,090 --> 01:50:09,630
the condo.

1825
01:50:09,630 --> 01:50:13,090
But we're responsible and it's one of
the reasons why we all became so strong,

1826
01:50:13,110 --> 01:50:17,870
you know, because you have no protection
in me and Brent Ernst and Sam Aaa,

1827
01:50:17,871 --> 01:50:19,600
we did this gig.
It's always my dad.

1828
01:50:21,760 --> 01:50:25,450
We did this Gig and a Africa earns,
gets off stage, you have to crush.

1829
01:50:25,451 --> 01:50:29,140
And he looks at me, goes comedy store
motherfucker. And I was like, yeah dude.

1830
01:50:29,440 --> 01:50:32,180
You know,
it's like that was a gym for us where,

1831
01:50:33,430 --> 01:50:35,770
and there was so many clients,

1832
01:50:35,830 --> 01:50:38,590
that place is a magnet
for Douche bag guys,

1833
01:50:39,370 --> 01:50:42,880
Tom and yell out and
try to disrupt the act.

1834
01:50:42,881 --> 01:50:47,620
And that's what dean of DRM on thought
it was okay to heckle, you know,

1835
01:50:47,650 --> 01:50:52,600
you know what I love with aren't the uh,
W W who is he? Joey, his brother. No,

1836
01:50:53,740 --> 01:50:56,290
no dog. Tony, Tony, Tony, Tony.

1837
01:50:59,180 --> 01:51:03,920
I want sweat. I made Bret go on one
night. I go, you don't understand.

1838
01:51:04,160 --> 01:51:08,270
It's not when you actually
start the rollers skating part.

1839
01:51:08,740 --> 01:51:13,040
It's, you have to explain to
the audience who Tony really is.

1840
01:51:14,020 --> 01:51:17,060
You got to get into his life
more. Just, Gosh, you're on stage.

1841
01:51:17,360 --> 01:51:22,360
You can't be afraid to expand on Tony's
life before you actually show them what

1842
01:51:22,611 --> 01:51:26,570
he does at the roller skating rink. Right.
You've got to talk about his history,

1843
01:51:26,810 --> 01:51:31,640
his family, you know, his likes,
his dislikes, what makes him happy.

1844
01:51:32,130 --> 01:51:33,080
So kind of bumps.

1845
01:51:33,370 --> 01:51:38,260
Rhett goes on one night and gets into
Tony's whole life that the crowd is like,

1846
01:51:38,330 --> 01:51:41,000
cause this is my type of humor
that people are looking like,

1847
01:51:41,270 --> 01:51:42,650
who the fuck is this guy?

1848
01:51:42,760 --> 01:51:46,610
He's talking and then he goes into
the bid of Tony Roller Skating.

1849
01:51:46,880 --> 01:51:51,590
But it was 20 minutes before we got to
the actual rovers before the music kicks

1850
01:51:51,591 --> 01:51:52,780
in before anything.

1851
01:51:52,910 --> 01:51:57,790
It's a great payoff though.
I mean we all know every Tony,

1852
01:51:57,791 --> 01:51:59,450
you know and Brent Arts
is such a good guy.

1853
01:51:59,460 --> 01:52:01,550
We were working together at
the Improv and he goes, Hey,

1854
01:52:01,551 --> 01:52:04,160
do you want me to not do
that? Bit like, I was like,

1855
01:52:04,161 --> 01:52:07,250
why would I didn't want you to not do the
best bet? He goes, because I don't know,

1856
01:52:07,251 --> 01:52:10,100
it's a real strong bed. I mean maybe
you don't want to follow that. And I go,

1857
01:52:10,101 --> 01:52:14,020
oh please, I want you to be as
funny as he can be. I enjoy that.

1858
01:52:14,240 --> 01:52:15,630
That's what it's about.
But that's a,

1859
01:52:15,650 --> 01:52:18,760
it's a weird thing where someone
for whatever reason think people,

1860
01:52:18,800 --> 01:52:21,290
people want to equate filth.

1861
01:52:21,620 --> 01:52:25,540
People want to acquaint other people's
success with somehow or another that

1862
01:52:25,550 --> 01:52:27,530
takes away from you.
And I think that's crazy.

1863
01:52:28,180 --> 01:52:31,190
It's a weird disease that people
have where you want to be.

1864
01:52:31,190 --> 01:52:33,320
The only person funny on
the show and you know,

1865
01:52:33,321 --> 01:52:35,930
and I know that there's a lot of comics
that brings up guys on the road with

1866
01:52:35,931 --> 01:52:39,110
them and they stack the deck.
They put terrible comedians up,

1867
01:52:39,140 --> 01:52:43,550
which is really not just rude to
their audience members. It's rude,

1868
01:52:43,580 --> 01:52:46,730
but it's also like,
so like the prodigious,

1869
01:52:46,910 --> 01:52:50,750
I know guys who bring up guys and there
was a national headliners do big places

1870
01:52:50,870 --> 01:52:54,140
and they bring up guys who shouldn't
be allowed to ever do comedy.

1871
01:52:54,380 --> 01:52:58,640
I mean you watch his poor audience
get assaulted with nonsense,

1872
01:52:58,850 --> 01:53:02,600
with nonsense in the, the fucking,
the, the rhythm of a comic.

1873
01:53:02,720 --> 01:53:05,090
Well see what I like to do,
like when Norman was with me,

1874
01:53:05,450 --> 01:53:08,930
a lot of times I would also, Steve
Simone just working for me, you know,

1875
01:53:08,931 --> 01:53:13,890
like road stuff. So I remember
when we were doing the, um, uh,

1876
01:53:13,940 --> 01:53:17,660
Venetian, okay. Some almost in
booked, there's a comic, you know,

1877
01:53:17,661 --> 01:53:21,110
I had Norton tope and for me
not and strong, so, you know,

1878
01:53:21,111 --> 01:53:24,350
we'd just backstage and we're gonna
start the show and that's when I look at

1879
01:53:24,351 --> 01:53:27,590
Simone and I go, you're on
deck. He goes, when he talks,

1880
01:53:27,620 --> 01:53:31,340
I got to go out and do your thing now
because I wouldn't want them thinking

1881
01:53:31,341 --> 01:53:36,170
about the act that they have. I just want
them instantly to walk out and do that.

1882
01:53:36,220 --> 01:53:40,700
I did it to Max to when he was younger.
Yeah. And you know, cause you know,

1883
01:53:40,701 --> 01:53:43,310
you got the guy coming on
before you that's going to kill.

1884
01:53:43,760 --> 01:53:46,120
So I like to take a
newer guy, you know, to,

1885
01:53:46,200 --> 01:53:50,810
to sort of train him in comedy and a guy
that really has his shit together that

1886
01:53:50,811 --> 01:53:54,260
I'm back there going, okay, you got
to amp up. He's killing. You know,

1887
01:53:54,261 --> 01:53:58,580
like when Eleanor goes up, I know if
the crowd is okay, I know if they suck,

1888
01:53:58,581 --> 01:54:02,630
I know if they're great, but the response
she's getting because she's top notch.

1889
01:54:02,680 --> 01:54:05,900
Right. You know what I mean? So when she
goes out there, I know her stuff kills.

1890
01:54:06,160 --> 01:54:06,910
So if they're just,

1891
01:54:06,910 --> 01:54:11,450
ha ha. I'm like, all right, another
shit crowd. You know what I mean?

1892
01:54:11,451 --> 01:54:12,980
So you've got to really be able to,

1893
01:54:13,310 --> 01:54:16,160
to know your audience
before you get out there.

1894
01:54:16,161 --> 01:54:20,320
And the only way to do it is to have an,
an unbelievably strong opener.

1895
01:54:20,660 --> 01:54:23,890
Because if you have somebody week,
if you have somebody weak,

1896
01:54:23,900 --> 01:54:26,490
you can't judge the crowd by
them because they're new. Right.

1897
01:54:26,540 --> 01:54:30,410
You know what I mean? Yeah. Having a
strong open is very important. It, yeah,

1898
01:54:30,411 --> 01:54:35,330
exactly. The whole show, the people that
don't do that are so silly. It's so dumb.

1899
01:54:35,370 --> 01:54:37,400
It's a, it's a weakness. It
doesn't make you look better.

1900
01:54:37,460 --> 01:54:42,110
So she better be strong in Chicago.
I'll tell Ya, through Brian onstage, we,

1901
01:54:42,111 --> 01:54:46,610
through Brian Red Band on stage in the
biggest crowd he'd ever seen and it later

1902
01:54:46,640 --> 01:54:48,760
was Redmond, right? Bam.

1903
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:56,560
Redmans and normal name. No Red Ban.
Red Band. No, no. I get it now, but I,

1904
01:54:56,561 --> 01:54:58,830
I've been calling them red
man and he didn't correct him.

1905
01:54:59,160 --> 01:55:01,240
Whenever you want it to
be we through. No, no.

1906
01:55:01,330 --> 01:55:04,660
I don't want it to be with he loves you.
I want it to be what you need his name.

1907
01:55:04,880 --> 01:55:09,680
Tell right now. We're going to make it
red with some money. Find Red on Joey Jay,

1908
01:55:09,681 --> 01:55:14,450
my new buddy. Double J. Double j Rogan
and what? Jay Rogan, my new shit.

1909
01:55:14,600 --> 01:55:18,650
Double J GCG Oh shit. On the road.
Double J. Picture what? What, what

1910
01:55:20,360 --> 01:55:22,820
you think I need to get some
sort of a diamond chain,

1911
01:55:22,821 --> 01:55:26,870
some sort of platinum and then
two J's together. Double J.

1912
01:55:26,870 --> 01:55:28,640
Strong nicknames and just
take pictures like this.

1913
01:55:28,641 --> 01:55:32,360
I've been thinking about it on a constant
bit cause every time I call you I'm

1914
01:55:32,361 --> 01:55:35,690
gone. He's going to have a
nickname now. He's got to have one.

1915
01:55:35,780 --> 01:55:37,250
I got to find out the middle name.

1916
01:55:37,280 --> 01:55:40,460
Everybody has nicknames so Brian
would tumble is a cool name.

1917
01:55:40,500 --> 01:55:44,480
It's a good but only by your friends,
by your friends. You don't let go.

1918
01:55:44,520 --> 01:55:47,490
Just pull your double Jane.
If it becomes that big,

1919
01:55:47,640 --> 01:55:51,640
you'll have no chickens too late. I
think you just started a revolution. No,

1920
01:55:51,820 --> 01:55:54,900
double j is a great name. Macom
juicy for short. Thanks Sweetie.

1921
01:55:54,990 --> 01:55:58,110
You know what I mean? So it's
a cool name for you. I like it.

1922
01:55:58,140 --> 01:55:59,640
The dice man coming to Saint Charles,

1923
01:55:59,641 --> 01:56:04,641
Illinois dice clay show time special
at the Arcadia theater on Saturday,

1924
01:56:04,801 --> 01:56:08,100
August 25th. If you're in Chicago, you
need to go and check this shit out.

1925
01:56:08,101 --> 01:56:08,970
If you're not in Chicago,

1926
01:56:08,971 --> 01:56:11,700
need to get on a fucking plane
and go and check this shit out.

1927
01:56:11,910 --> 01:56:16,910
And if you go to oh shows o s h o w
s.com or you can call the theater.

1928
01:56:18,541 --> 01:56:23,100
The number for the
theater is (630) 962-7000.

1929
01:56:23,101 --> 01:56:27,840
I'll say it again.
(630) 962-7000.

1930
01:56:27,841 --> 01:56:32,840
That's not hard to remember. Bitch, relax.
And uh, the people who are listening. So,

1931
01:56:32,841 --> 01:56:36,450
uh, this is your first
special and 17 fucking years.

1932
01:56:36,720 --> 01:56:41,040
Do you have a new name for
it? The special, is it,
have you named it yet? Yeah,

1933
01:56:41,080 --> 01:56:45,640
I have. Is going to be
surprised. No, it's exciting.

1934
01:56:45,900 --> 01:56:48,630
You don't know the name of the
special. You're with me. I know,

1935
01:56:48,631 --> 01:56:52,370
but it's called dice and
destructible in destructive.

1936
01:56:53,600 --> 01:56:56,760
Change it back. No, don't talk about
it. Don't talk about them a name.

1937
01:56:56,761 --> 01:56:57,530
There's no reason.

1938
01:56:57,530 --> 01:57:01,240
Because that's the name. What if you
had like a Twitter contest to say like,

1939
01:57:01,330 --> 01:57:03,940
you know what the name would be? Well
you know we could do it. All right.

1940
01:57:03,941 --> 01:57:07,660
So on the real dice clay,
send me what you think.

1941
01:57:07,750 --> 01:57:12,210
Even though I'm going to use what
I already know and what are the,

1942
01:57:12,220 --> 01:57:16,570
I don't know what they come up with.
Well let me hear it.

1943
01:57:16,600 --> 01:57:18,960
Let me hear what they've got.
This unbelievable, you know, list.

1944
01:57:19,880 --> 01:57:23,200
It's pretty fucking good. Indestructable
cause I feel I've been through a lot.

1945
01:57:23,230 --> 01:57:27,010
I feel my fans have been through
a lot, you know, so, so I really,

1946
01:57:27,190 --> 01:57:31,330
and this show is such a rock
and roll vibe, you know,

1947
01:57:31,331 --> 01:57:35,230
I really want to create what I would call,
you know,

1948
01:57:35,350 --> 01:57:38,500
the most exciting,
standup special I've ever done.

1949
01:57:39,010 --> 01:57:43,330
That's what I want to give people.
How was it for you to go through all that

1950
01:57:43,440 --> 01:57:46,650
censorship stuff when MTV banned you?

1951
01:57:46,651 --> 01:57:50,960
Because you were talking about Feminine
Hygiene Products? I mean it was so, oh,

1952
01:57:51,140 --> 01:57:53,310
you know what it was
when my career took off,

1953
01:57:53,520 --> 01:57:55,110
like for the first 10 years when I was,

1954
01:57:55,140 --> 01:57:59,670
when I was just doing the clubs around
the country and honing my act and I would

1955
01:57:59,671 --> 01:58:04,140
get write ups from local papers.
They would write me up like in newspapers,

1956
01:58:04,141 --> 01:58:07,410
like the hoodlum of Uma, things
like that. Like it was all,

1957
01:58:07,411 --> 01:58:10,110
it was all positive stuff.
And then they'd write about the act.

1958
01:58:10,670 --> 01:58:13,740
The the day after my Hbo Special Ed,

1959
01:58:13,741 --> 01:58:18,210
the dice man cometh the La,
the New York Times put the headline,

1960
01:58:18,450 --> 01:58:23,310
the demise of Western
civilization. See, I never know,

1961
01:58:23,311 --> 01:58:24,144
but they ripped off.

1962
01:58:24,150 --> 01:58:28,200
They ripped the whole show apart and I
wasn't prepared for it because as I was

1963
01:58:28,201 --> 01:58:32,540
coming up as a comic, I wasn't thinking
I want to be a controversial comic. Yeah.

1964
01:58:32,580 --> 01:58:35,400
I wasn't even thinking,
I just did the act I wanted to do.

1965
01:58:35,401 --> 01:58:39,090
So it was like almost like getting
a, you know, a sucker punch.

1966
01:58:39,090 --> 01:58:43,480
I didn't see it common. So when all that
media backlash happened, I was like,

1967
01:58:43,840 --> 01:58:47,380
don't they get, I'm just a comic, I'm not
running for office here. I'm a common,

1968
01:58:47,381 --> 01:58:50,980
well there was something that you felt
like you were being hateful. It was like,

1969
01:58:51,650 --> 01:58:55,690
no, it's just towards foreigners.
And you know, there was,

1970
01:58:55,750 --> 01:58:59,200
there was moments where people are just
really overreacting. And I was like,

1971
01:58:59,380 --> 01:59:04,300
how come that's okay in rap music or
it's okay. And that all came after it.

1972
01:59:04,301 --> 01:59:08,620
See all that heavy rap,
all the shows like South Park,

1973
01:59:08,621 --> 01:59:11,470
all the controversial show came after me.

1974
01:59:11,471 --> 01:59:13,990
So now that I survived all that,

1975
01:59:13,991 --> 01:59:16,480
when I went through it was
that I stopped live crew.

1976
01:59:16,690 --> 01:59:20,530
What's at the same time?
Yeah, it was around the same,

1977
01:59:20,531 --> 01:59:23,440
because I remember you be connected
to that and all arguments about it.

1978
01:59:23,441 --> 01:59:28,320
So you know how many rap songs I'm in.
Yeah. I mean, even the song by that one,

1979
01:59:32,100 --> 01:59:37,100
EMS permission for that or do I let them
sample me because they called my office

1980
01:59:38,351 --> 01:59:42,640
and said Dev writing a song about
me did defending me, you know,

1981
01:59:42,641 --> 01:59:46,990
so we allowed them to sample,
you know,

1982
01:59:46,991 --> 01:59:51,010
and that song they wanted
me to present them with,

1983
01:59:51,011 --> 01:59:55,210
they won for best song of the year
with MTV and they wanted me to be the

1984
01:59:55,211 --> 01:59:59,010
presenter and still MTV when let me on it.
They still have a,

1985
01:59:59,040 --> 02:00:00,520
did they let it go now?
Yeah,

1986
02:00:00,530 --> 02:00:05,500
they unbanned me last year
when I did on Turo stupid.

1987
02:00:06,160 --> 02:00:10,660
I understand what happened because
when I went on MTV and did what I did,

1988
02:00:11,110 --> 02:00:14,560
you know, it was at a time when nobody
did that and there was no beeping.

1989
02:00:14,920 --> 02:00:18,700
You know, even my manager at the time,
Sandy Gallin called me up and said,

1990
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:23,680
I thought that was just on my television.
Like he couldn't believe the language,

1991
02:00:23,880 --> 02:00:24,460
you know,

1992
02:00:24,460 --> 02:00:27,700
and the banding for life was one of the
greatest things that ever happened to me.

1993
02:00:28,390 --> 02:00:29,750
You know, I went from, you know,

1994
02:00:30,070 --> 02:00:34,930
from doing one show at a 20,000 seat arena
to three shows that weekend. You know,

1995
02:00:34,931 --> 02:00:39,310
and I was like, I don't give a fuck.
I'm not a singer. Not Today, not today.

1996
02:00:39,340 --> 02:00:41,590
You don't need them anymore.
They're not as important.

1997
02:00:42,070 --> 02:00:47,070
You doing the tonight show is not nearly
as impactful as you do in a podcast.

1998
02:00:47,570 --> 02:00:50,980
That's sounding, I'll never have to
worry about if you did the APP show,

1999
02:00:50,981 --> 02:00:54,310
it would have more because
fucking Shane Dilia head,

2000
02:00:55,090 --> 02:01:00,090
another comic that won't put on any
comics that'll shine that chandelier big

2001
02:01:02,700 --> 02:01:07,090
fuck. You know what, you know I, you
know, I never did let them in either,

2002
02:01:07,120 --> 02:01:10,210
but I don't have anything against him.
I think he's great at a show.

2003
02:01:10,660 --> 02:01:12,430
But Leno was always the type.

2004
02:01:12,670 --> 02:01:16,870
Like I talk about the comics that on
like he was never a type to want to help

2005
02:01:16,900 --> 02:01:20,560
his fellow comics.
So that's why when he brings a comic on,

2006
02:01:20,590 --> 02:01:23,380
they don't become superstars
because number one,

2007
02:01:23,410 --> 02:01:26,650
a lot of them don't even have the
chops to be on a show like that yet.

2008
02:01:26,980 --> 02:01:28,630
So they'll do okay.

2009
02:01:28,720 --> 02:01:33,280
Well he does to help Norton and nortons
an exception, not as an exception,

2010
02:01:33,460 --> 02:01:35,620
you know,
and he does a lot of on the street stuff.

2011
02:01:35,621 --> 02:01:38,410
And northern became a star before
we ever went online. All right.

2012
02:01:38,470 --> 02:01:41,870
But Leno doesn't look to hey sit down
like Johnny would do what you're saying.

2013
02:01:41,880 --> 02:01:44,740
So he doesn't create stars. He
doesn't, he's not looking to,

2014
02:01:45,040 --> 02:01:49,070
he only gives that this fucking
guy only cares about him.

2015
02:01:49,100 --> 02:01:51,500
Trust me on that.
If you really stop and think about that.

2016
02:01:51,500 --> 02:01:54,440
If you are a comic and you do have a show
where you occasionally I've comics on

2017
02:01:54,441 --> 02:01:57,310
what do you want like to promote all
your friends? No, he doesn't give a fuck.

2018
02:01:57,311 --> 02:01:59,780
You do it.
Let me tell you something.

2019
02:02:00,990 --> 02:02:02,650
No one knew me for years when,
uh,

2020
02:02:02,670 --> 02:02:05,030
when I was struggling and
he was already a big comic.

2021
02:02:05,031 --> 02:02:09,200
He was already cold hosting costs in.
And when my career took off,

2022
02:02:09,201 --> 02:02:11,360
he would bad mouth me to newspapers.

2023
02:02:11,630 --> 02:02:16,400
And I got hold of this fucking bold
ahead and the Improv. And I said,

2024
02:02:16,460 --> 02:02:19,850
trust me, when I tell you this next
time I won't be talking to you.

2025
02:02:20,060 --> 02:02:22,820
You won't even see me coming if
you ever open your fucking mouth.

2026
02:02:22,821 --> 02:02:23,720
I love that expression.

2027
02:02:23,721 --> 02:02:26,270
And he goes to me when I said
it goes with his stupid voice.

2028
02:02:26,271 --> 02:02:30,740
You know what I had pitched, I can't
even do this asshole. Yeah, he goes,

2029
02:02:32,360 --> 02:02:36,110
he goes, we weren't really expecting
to become the stars that we, and I got,

2030
02:02:36,111 --> 02:02:39,590
let me tell you something.
Maybe you weren't expecting
to become a big time guy,

2031
02:02:39,800 --> 02:02:42,920
but I knew exactly where the
fuck I was going. You know?

2032
02:02:42,921 --> 02:02:46,910
And it's guys like that that I don't like
because they really don't look to help.

2033
02:02:47,150 --> 02:02:48,740
Even the guys they bring on,

2034
02:02:48,890 --> 02:02:51,890
well he just filling those five
minutes like he's supposed to.

2035
02:02:51,891 --> 02:02:53,930
He's always been friendly
to me when I'm done to show.

2036
02:02:53,931 --> 02:02:57,060
So I can't say anything bad
about the guy but the hump and I,

2037
02:02:57,250 --> 02:02:59,310
it's okay that you're like,
just like, I don't know.

2038
02:03:00,490 --> 02:03:03,890
When was the last time you did an Leno
shot? I did it like a year ago. Maybe a,

2039
02:03:03,891 --> 02:03:06,620
yeah. When, when fear factors
back on, I did it with Ron Paul,

2040
02:03:07,580 --> 02:03:11,420
but a guy like you who's had
series, you know, if the series,

2041
02:03:11,421 --> 02:03:13,850
fear fact they've been on the road,
want to go on?

2042
02:03:14,510 --> 02:03:17,480
Well maybe that's the way
your friends, yeah, I'm not
asking you to go on it. Yeah,

2043
02:03:17,481 --> 02:03:22,160
I know my son just sky anything.
The last time I saw him I was doing this,

2044
02:03:22,161 --> 02:03:22,580
uh,

2045
02:03:22,580 --> 02:03:27,580
I was hosting this late night show with
Judd Nelson for one day and all of a

2046
02:03:27,651 --> 02:03:30,980
sudden somebody comes over and he
goes, uh, Leno wants to say hello.

2047
02:03:30,981 --> 02:03:34,820
And this was at, they had a fight with him
years earlier. So I go over to the set,

2048
02:03:34,850 --> 02:03:38,780
you know, and he's standing on the stage,
no one's there, and I'm just bullshit.

2049
02:03:38,790 --> 02:03:41,720
When am I go? So when are we doing the
show? And he goes, we need to set it up.

2050
02:03:42,060 --> 02:03:46,610
And I go, well, let's set it up. It's only
been 20 years, you know, and uh, he goes,

2051
02:03:46,611 --> 02:03:49,430
no, we're going to do it. And of course
it never happened. I'm like, what?

2052
02:03:49,430 --> 02:03:53,390
This is so want me to see him on
his set, you know, like I get it,

2053
02:03:53,391 --> 02:03:56,750
you're hosting a fucking talk show.
That to me is old fucking hat.

2054
02:03:57,140 --> 02:03:59,870
You know what I mean?
And that's just how I feel about.

2055
02:03:59,871 --> 02:04:03,380
And when you don't help your fellow
comics and you're in a position like,

2056
02:04:03,620 --> 02:04:08,180
like Carson was years ago, when he'd
bring a comic on, he would fucking,

2057
02:04:08,450 --> 02:04:11,540
he was so confident about who he was,
right?

2058
02:04:12,170 --> 02:04:17,030
He was just so confident that
when he bring on a Rodney
or, uh, or any new comic,

2059
02:04:17,031 --> 02:04:21,950
you know, he wanted you to shoot the guy.
If the guy shines, come on over, sit down,

2060
02:04:21,951 --> 02:04:24,620
and he'd let them shine even
more. It wasn't like, oh,

2061
02:04:24,621 --> 02:04:26,480
I'm giving them too
much time away from it.

2062
02:04:26,660 --> 02:04:29,300
You run the show every night
for 90 fucking minutes.

2063
02:04:29,630 --> 02:04:32,270
Give a guy five minutes to make it,
you know what I mean?

2064
02:04:32,720 --> 02:04:36,950
And that's where Leno in him, a two
different men, because you know,

2065
02:04:36,990 --> 02:04:38,010
let them and does it.
He

2066
02:04:38,010 --> 02:04:42,690
brings on the guys, um,
uh, uh, Kimmel does it.

2067
02:04:42,691 --> 02:04:46,950
They all do it. You know, I think
there's a few guys that know,

2068
02:04:46,951 --> 02:04:47,760
first of all,

2069
02:04:47,760 --> 02:04:52,260
they get how few slots there are and how
much competition there is and no one's

2070
02:04:52,261 --> 02:04:53,350
more aware of that than Jay.

2071
02:04:53,570 --> 02:04:57,330
Jay is interested in buying this next
old Volkswagen and making it look like a

2072
02:04:57,331 --> 02:05:01,020
hot rock. Those old code, I won't bad
mouth them because you a friend of hers,

2073
02:05:01,021 --> 02:05:05,650
so I'm going to let it go. He's always
been nice to me on the shots. Exactly.

2074
02:05:05,660 --> 02:05:08,820
So I should have never, I didn't grow
up with them. I mean I didn't call Amy.

2075
02:05:08,850 --> 02:05:11,160
I'll see him again.
I'll tell him how you feel.

2076
02:05:11,820 --> 02:05:15,290
Fucking he shook off
real fucking jerk off.

2077
02:05:16,050 --> 02:05:19,110
He doesn't have anything out there
that you could buy. He's a comic,

2078
02:05:19,111 --> 02:05:23,700
but it's hard to buy a Jay Leno CD. It's
not like it comes out with new material.

2079
02:05:23,910 --> 02:05:25,440
Well he does his show on the tonight show.

2080
02:05:25,441 --> 02:05:27,750
Does that monologue and
he doesn't shows outside,

2081
02:05:27,751 --> 02:05:30,330
but he recycles the same
act for the most part.

2082
02:05:30,360 --> 02:05:33,090
Apparently he doesn't want to do a special
because why don't we do I thank you.

2083
02:05:33,091 --> 02:05:36,070
Okay.
You know like

2084
02:05:41,080 --> 02:05:44,790
true. He doesn't, you know what I'm
saying is he doesn't put out material,

2085
02:05:44,970 --> 02:05:46,620
which is, which is odd. And I, his,

2086
02:05:46,650 --> 02:05:50,220
his reasoning for it is that it would
cost him money because he couldn't do that

2087
02:05:50,221 --> 02:05:54,180
act anymore and you have to write a whole
new act. I thought that was really odd.

2088
02:05:54,530 --> 02:05:57,750
But he's known like when he was young,

2089
02:05:57,970 --> 02:06:01,320
I like about Seinfeld because with,
with all his fame and everything,

2090
02:06:01,321 --> 02:06:03,960
he still gets out there and
he does the stand up. Yeah.

2091
02:06:04,250 --> 02:06:07,200
And as far as the cleaner guys,
I would have to say he's just,

2092
02:06:07,240 --> 02:06:10,100
well he's a master at that
kind of just the best.

2093
02:06:10,230 --> 02:06:15,160
But that stuff never makes me laugh as
much as you're kind of stuff I don't want.

2094
02:06:17,230 --> 02:06:19,980
I see observational stuff and
it's interesting. It's funny,

2095
02:06:19,981 --> 02:06:24,840
but it's not ridiculous.
But I go from what's behind
close doors, these, you know,

2096
02:06:24,841 --> 02:06:29,250
like Seinfeld. It's ridiculous.
Some of it. Yeah. And I love,

2097
02:06:29,260 --> 02:06:33,330
fantasy is beautiful. It's
fun, it's silly. It's,

2098
02:06:33,331 --> 02:06:37,830
your show is so silly. It's so fun.
Like we had such a great fucking time.

2099
02:06:38,040 --> 02:06:42,450
There's so much shit that you just
say it all. And it's just so well

2100
02:06:44,220 --> 02:06:47,640
with Norton when you were laughing at
that particular bid. I know the bit,

2101
02:06:48,180 --> 02:06:52,290
that's the stuff Norton and goes crazy
for you because he knows that was

2102
02:06:52,350 --> 02:06:55,980
absolutely no thought.
There were no facts.

2103
02:06:56,040 --> 02:06:57,430
But if flows grade,

2104
02:06:57,450 --> 02:07:02,450
it's funny fucking you know that to
me and I love Jerry Seinfeld thing.

2105
02:07:02,490 --> 02:07:05,670
He's a great comedian. I think it
was great as an actor on that show.

2106
02:07:05,880 --> 02:07:08,460
But if I had a choice, she had seen
him or you, I'd always see you.

2107
02:07:09,340 --> 02:07:11,400
I appreciate that kind of Hume Dam.
Why?

2108
02:07:11,401 --> 02:07:15,420
Because I know the kind of guy you want
and I know that's why you would come see

2109
02:07:15,421 --> 02:07:19,700
me cause you know I'm going to deliver
what you need for your laughs. Yeah.

2110
02:07:20,150 --> 02:07:23,900
I appreciate it as a,
you know like at that forum,

2111
02:07:24,070 --> 02:07:28,740
sorry I to look real pioneer. Uh, I'm
sorry I didn't throw somebody out for you.

2112
02:07:29,190 --> 02:07:30,023
Throw somebody out

2113
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:35,680
like within the first two minutes what
happened right to the right. Your,

2114
02:07:35,860 --> 02:07:39,940
your right, your lower right. There
was a, a drunk asshole and you're like,

2115
02:07:39,970 --> 02:07:43,450
oh this is not gonna work. I can tell
you right now. This is not going to,

2116
02:07:43,451 --> 02:07:48,250
was it a ketamine moment? Guy
Was, the guy was hammer and he can

2117
02:07:50,920 --> 02:07:53,320
remember he, when he got up and
walked out, he couldn't even,

2118
02:07:53,321 --> 02:07:56,320
he didn't know what the fuck was
even happening. He was so drunk.

2119
02:07:56,350 --> 02:07:58,630
That's why I want him out.
You know what I mean? Don't,

2120
02:07:58,631 --> 02:08:01,140
don't try to help me up there.
You couldn't have worked with that guy.

2121
02:08:01,170 --> 02:08:04,140
I know certain guys that are just
so hammered. There's nowhere.

2122
02:08:05,500 --> 02:08:06,550
I calmed him down

2123
02:08:08,210 --> 02:08:11,950
with the band coming out that he would
be cool and they think it's a joke when I

2124
02:08:11,951 --> 02:08:15,010
say I'm going to throw. Yeah,
I'll give him a chance, you know?

2125
02:08:15,011 --> 02:08:17,830
I'll always give him a go sit in
the corner. What about tonight?

2126
02:08:17,831 --> 02:08:20,870
I started going up the back of 30 seconds.
Yeah.

2127
02:08:20,871 --> 02:08:23,850
What about when it come to the back of
the theater? When the guy got me mad,

2128
02:08:23,851 --> 02:08:25,360
I walked out to go and look

2129
02:08:25,650 --> 02:08:26,770
the bike.
I went afterwards.

2130
02:08:28,960 --> 02:08:31,650
That was the guy in the back of the room.
Would you do,

2131
02:08:31,651 --> 02:08:33,180
there was a guy in the back of the room.

2132
02:08:33,240 --> 02:08:37,350
Got On my nerves and get
security out of this,

2133
02:08:37,440 --> 02:08:40,620
get this Guy Outta here and
nobody's coming. So I go, look,

2134
02:08:40,621 --> 02:08:43,740
I'll throw you out personally, I don't
care. I don't know what you look like.

2135
02:08:43,741 --> 02:08:48,590
I don't know. I'm coming to get you.
And I just went towards the back and,

2136
02:08:48,600 --> 02:08:51,480
but at the time I was nearly there. They
had security, Paul and the guy. Yeah.

2137
02:08:51,870 --> 02:08:56,280
Oh my God. Oh, oh, you
want to hit a burst? Oh,

2138
02:08:56,310 --> 02:09:00,690
this is great. A couple weeks ago and
met governors in Long Island and like,

2139
02:09:00,740 --> 02:09:01,051
you know,

2140
02:09:01,051 --> 02:09:05,520
now and then I get the real ass hole and
there's a guy with dark glasses like me

2141
02:09:05,521 --> 02:09:08,970
and he's fucking drunk and be an asshole.
So I said,

2142
02:09:08,971 --> 02:09:11,880
open your fucking mouth again and
I'll throw you the fuck outta here.

2143
02:09:11,910 --> 02:09:15,080
Let's see what happens. You
know? And the guy's just yelling.

2144
02:09:15,090 --> 02:09:17,310
He don't even know what
he's yelling. So, you know,

2145
02:09:17,340 --> 02:09:19,210
they got tough guys working at governors,

2146
02:09:19,260 --> 02:09:22,230
so they come to throw the
guy out after the show.

2147
02:09:22,231 --> 02:09:24,540
Don Jamison goes,

2148
02:09:24,810 --> 02:09:28,320
you missed the greatest thing I ever
saw at one of these shows. I go,

2149
02:09:28,321 --> 02:09:32,730
what happened? He goes, you know
the guy you threw out, he was blind.

2150
02:09:33,600 --> 02:09:36,300
I go, what? He goes,
not only was he blind,

2151
02:09:36,301 --> 02:09:40,680
he was fighting for the guys
here going fucking dice.

2152
02:09:40,890 --> 02:09:44,460
I'll kick his fucking ass all
day and talk to me like that.

2153
02:09:44,700 --> 02:09:48,300
And these guys couldn't hold them down.
They said he had like retarded strength,

2154
02:09:48,920 --> 02:09:53,850
you know, and he's swinging his fucking
stick at them. He's swinging the stick.

2155
02:09:53,990 --> 02:09:54,840
I go, well, you know,

2156
02:09:54,841 --> 02:09:57,510
it's not like he had a dog with
him that I could know he's blind.

2157
02:09:57,511 --> 02:10:01,250
All I know is was a drunk asshole
and he got what was coming to them.

2158
02:10:01,650 --> 02:10:03,560
You know what I mean?
But you know,

2159
02:10:03,630 --> 02:10:06,150
I would've liked to see that
at least to get it on film.

2160
02:10:07,740 --> 02:10:11,040
That's a great youtube piece
that I did filming anything.

2161
02:10:11,041 --> 02:10:13,320
Why didn't the guy take out
his phone and fund them?

2162
02:10:13,321 --> 02:10:15,210
Fighting him so he
could put it on youtube.

2163
02:10:15,240 --> 02:10:17,310
He didn't even see them
coming to throw them out.

2164
02:10:17,710 --> 02:10:21,490
We're eventually all going to have those
Google goggles on and you won't need a

2165
02:10:21,491 --> 02:10:23,890
youtube or an eye on iPhone.
It's going to,

2166
02:10:23,900 --> 02:10:26,710
but we're going to film everything you
see through your eyes. They're already,

2167
02:10:26,711 --> 02:10:30,700
we're already working on it. Yeah.
There's just no privacy. Google,

2168
02:10:30,701 --> 02:10:33,680
there's Google goggles is legit,
man. They, they put it on,

2169
02:10:33,681 --> 02:10:35,600
it's got a little small
lands in the corner.

2170
02:10:35,750 --> 02:10:39,470
It's like you're a fucking terminator.
It's like you have this readout. You can,

2171
02:10:39,471 --> 02:10:44,300
you could get navigation photo. It's
going to buy it. You could take photos.

2172
02:10:45,650 --> 02:10:49,520
You're going to make video. You gonna
be able to broadcast in shit out.

2173
02:10:49,750 --> 02:10:50,930
What happened at fun?
Well,

2174
02:10:50,931 --> 02:10:53,570
what happened to progress
and technological innovation.

2175
02:10:53,571 --> 02:10:56,660
It's going to keep going and not
going to stop it. If you want a car,

2176
02:10:56,720 --> 02:10:59,470
you got to deal with the consequences
that people want and time travel. Okay.

2177
02:10:59,660 --> 02:11:01,340
Because it's all comes
from the same place.

2178
02:11:01,600 --> 02:11:05,030
It all comes from people figuring out
amazing shit. People figure it out.

2179
02:11:05,031 --> 02:11:08,180
Amazing Shit and they never stopped.
They will never fucking stop ever.

2180
02:11:08,300 --> 02:11:11,270
And Google goggles is going to
lead to Google contact lenses,

2181
02:11:11,450 --> 02:11:13,610
which is going to lead to
Google neural implants,

2182
02:11:13,760 --> 02:11:17,750
which is going to lead to who knows
what kind of fun to my retirement.

2183
02:11:19,670 --> 02:11:23,930
I'm fucking luck getting those.
Get some tests before you die.

2184
02:11:23,931 --> 02:11:26,840
What the fuck you like about it?
You know what I mean?

2185
02:11:27,150 --> 02:11:31,490
You know she's a nice girl.
Which all don't stuff your ass though.

2186
02:11:31,840 --> 02:11:36,020
She's only shows your ass.
Don't think that's what I'm saying.

2187
02:11:36,750 --> 02:11:41,040
The dimensions you don't under. She's
not built for big tits. She, she's,

2188
02:11:41,570 --> 02:11:46,100
she's got plenty. You're right and a half
feet wide. You're, you're eight inches.

2189
02:11:46,160 --> 02:11:47,520
Eight and a half inches wide.

2190
02:11:48,110 --> 02:11:51,920
If you measure with broad woman her
depth and it just strikes me, man.

2191
02:11:53,210 --> 02:11:54,090
I'm telling you.
Look at it.

2192
02:11:54,240 --> 02:11:57,870
Have you seen with Kim Kardashian
has done to her ass? I don't pay any.

2193
02:11:58,340 --> 02:12:00,630
Apparently there's new
video of it and some,

2194
02:12:00,650 --> 02:12:03,950
some guy on youtube and said it looked
like she was wearing a diaper filled with

2195
02:12:03,951 --> 02:12:08,660
pudding. She's got another ass
job. She's got her ass larger. No,

2196
02:12:08,750 --> 02:12:11,930
no doubt. I don't know why she quit.
She probably had a half a decent,

2197
02:12:11,950 --> 02:12:15,350
well she only had one shot at, I
mean, I don't mind the reality show.

2198
02:12:15,930 --> 02:12:19,550
I mean fucking movie she made,
she was on the money.

2199
02:12:19,580 --> 02:12:22,610
Wouldn't it be great to watch her fuck
one of those giant super athletes that

2200
02:12:22,611 --> 02:12:25,790
she fucks
the movies.

2201
02:12:27,500 --> 02:12:31,550
Even that movie she did like nobody
really talks about it enough.

2202
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:35,120
You know what I mean? Because she was
a natural work. Great work. Right?

2203
02:12:35,180 --> 02:12:36,900
She's a natural attention whore.
No,

2204
02:12:36,901 --> 02:12:41,901
but what I'm saying is why quit cinema
now that you've got your TV show?

2205
02:12:42,050 --> 02:12:44,210
Well she thinks that that
got her to the dance,

2206
02:12:44,211 --> 02:12:47,630
but there's more money legitimately in
commercials like for Skechers when you go

2207
02:12:47,631 --> 02:12:50,480
to the airport and you want to go to put
your fucking wallet in the band, you'll

2208
02:12:53,170 --> 02:12:57,920
check this morning. I want to look
at it. You got to, this is really,

2209
02:12:57,921 --> 02:13:01,250
it's really strange. It's really
strange. Watch. Look at her ass.

2210
02:13:01,270 --> 02:13:04,390
But I mean it doesn't even look
real like watch, watch when they,

2211
02:13:04,410 --> 02:13:08,870
they're focused on it. Like what? Check
it. Check it. Check it. Here we go.

2212
02:13:09,320 --> 02:13:12,560
What's that? What the fuck
that, what the fuck is that?

2213
02:13:12,561 --> 02:13:13,590
She's wearing a diaper filled.

2214
02:13:13,600 --> 02:13:18,600
We're putting back a
little bit Brian Motion.

2215
02:13:19,020 --> 02:13:21,680
She is listened. Shit. Don't,
don't get me wrong. I'm not hating.

2216
02:13:22,190 --> 02:13:24,770
Did this part is the boring part.
You want to get past this?

2217
02:13:25,200 --> 02:13:29,390
You want to go to the
others? Yeah. Not this part.

2218
02:13:30,560 --> 02:13:33,200
From here on this is,
this is where it gets crazy slow motion.

2219
02:13:33,660 --> 02:13:37,080
Look what's going on there.
What's that? That's not even real.

2220
02:13:37,081 --> 02:13:38,610
That is not real man.

2221
02:13:38,730 --> 02:13:41,370
She's doing something crazy
because it doesn't match her ledge.

2222
02:13:41,400 --> 02:13:44,940
She looks like the Penguin I
in that Batman movie, dude,

2223
02:13:44,941 --> 02:13:49,050
it's not real because her upper body's
not changing. Her arms aren't changing.

2224
02:13:49,140 --> 02:13:52,980
She's stuffing her ass like a Turkey.
It's just craziness.

2225
02:13:53,010 --> 02:13:57,150
It's absolute complete madness because
the way she had a beautiful body to begin

2226
02:13:57,151 --> 02:14:00,690
with, you know what it is. They get
so affected that they can't do enough.

2227
02:14:00,691 --> 02:14:04,170
Like when they blow up that lips like
Betty boop. You know what I mean?

2228
02:14:04,171 --> 02:14:08,310
They do that whole, you know what the
fuck? That's sad. None of it works.

2229
02:14:08,450 --> 02:14:11,460
The the lips don't work. Look,
you want it for a young girl.

2230
02:14:11,461 --> 02:14:14,390
Somebody that doesn't need this shit,
but tits work. It does work too,

2231
02:14:14,960 --> 02:14:18,240
but she doesn't have the frame.
It shouldn't do it. She'd get the

2232
02:14:19,870 --> 02:14:24,750
frame. I probably would have
already done it. I was a girl.

2233
02:14:24,751 --> 02:14:29,510
I'd probably have giant tits. I'd
probably a 38 double D's I fucked that.

2234
02:14:29,520 --> 02:14:32,880
Had the biggest house in Bel Air. If I was
a check, I wouldn't even think of work.

2235
02:14:33,720 --> 02:14:36,150
We'll put little crutches in front
of me and I'll walk like that.

2236
02:14:36,180 --> 02:14:39,030
Wheeler's put some wheels.
She always talks about it,

2237
02:14:39,160 --> 02:14:43,860
but that's the 300 does
snap them on their breasts,

2238
02:14:44,850 --> 02:14:49,110
breasts or someone acceptable? I wouldn't
ever, man would prefer natural breasts.

2239
02:14:49,140 --> 02:14:52,650
Breasts are somewhat acceptable,
but there's nothing that
we're, the ass is wrong.

2240
02:14:52,740 --> 02:14:55,410
It's wrong.
Am doing something crazy,

2241
02:14:55,800 --> 02:14:58,980
especially when a woman can have
really nice legs just by working out.

2242
02:14:59,100 --> 02:15:03,620
That's what we learned. I don't know
about you, but you know what I mean.

2243
02:15:03,660 --> 02:15:07,700
Check out this ass Katy Perry the other
day and one of those water parks her.

2244
02:15:07,710 --> 02:15:12,450
She lost her. Let me see
here. Let me get to it.

2245
02:15:12,451 --> 02:15:17,160
Right. Well, should you
have image right here?

2246
02:15:17,370 --> 02:15:18,410
She has big boobies.

2247
02:15:21,890 --> 02:15:22,723
How?
Come on?

2248
02:15:24,490 --> 02:15:28,980
That's photo shops. No, it's
not. There's, there's a lot
of them. There's a lot. Yeah.

2249
02:15:29,020 --> 02:15:31,510
There's a lot of photos.
There's people just,

2250
02:15:31,511 --> 02:15:33,960
I wouldn't fold her right
out of the pool and look at,

2251
02:15:34,690 --> 02:15:35,523
nope,

2252
02:15:35,960 --> 02:15:39,790
you know what? This is where we think
the same way make it. But first of all,

2253
02:15:39,791 --> 02:15:41,320
I don't,
I don't buy that.

2254
02:15:41,321 --> 02:15:43,640
That just happened and she's out
swimming with a bunch of fuckers.

2255
02:15:44,380 --> 02:15:47,150
This is all it's about. It's a
publicity stunt. That's right.

2256
02:15:47,410 --> 02:15:50,410
They did it on purpose. They're trying
to get more people to go see her movie.

2257
02:15:50,411 --> 02:15:53,800
The box office returns probably
weren't what they expected. So Pete,

2258
02:15:53,820 --> 02:15:56,110
let's find out more about Katie out
and now that we've seen her ass,

2259
02:15:56,320 --> 02:16:01,260
here's their movie. Oh God, I'm not
buying it. I love all of you know,

2260
02:16:01,270 --> 02:16:03,910
I don't buy it, but I enjoy it. I do too.

2261
02:16:03,911 --> 02:16:05,890
She's got a killer and
master gas masks like that.

2262
02:16:05,891 --> 02:16:10,240
I would want the world to
said dip kid dick in and move
on. Show everybody. Right.

2263
02:16:10,910 --> 02:16:14,320
You stream new shoe stream.
They'll pause you just showed

2264
02:16:19,060 --> 02:16:21,530
was that to get fucking Russell Crowe,

2265
02:16:21,650 --> 02:16:26,650
cause this is the new guy
dipping his dick in and Oh,

2266
02:16:26,900 --> 02:16:30,650
you know what I mean?
All these filthy slobs that dead.

2267
02:16:31,480 --> 02:16:36,440
His wife gave me a spray Tan.
She has a film that day.

2268
02:16:36,820 --> 02:16:40,210
Are you enjoying it? And she took a
picture of me and put it on Facebook.

2269
02:16:40,950 --> 02:16:43,340
I wasn't does all the
hair and make up shit.

2270
02:16:45,550 --> 02:16:47,820
She's unbelievable.
But she's just practices.

2271
02:16:47,840 --> 02:16:52,530
They got the spray machine that it looks
hilarious. She paints you orange. No,

2272
02:16:52,531 --> 02:16:53,361
but what she did,

2273
02:16:53,361 --> 02:16:58,060
she put a tent in the backyard the
other day and she put a 10 shut.

2274
02:16:58,150 --> 02:17:00,880
Shut up. Shut up. I'm
trying to promote Valerie.

2275
02:17:01,370 --> 02:17:04,600
Oh come on please. Do you believe what?
I'm going to go extra. I'm no girl.

2276
02:17:04,640 --> 02:17:07,430
I'm nice enough to put her
on your show. Yeah, no girl.

2277
02:17:07,700 --> 02:17:10,220
And she just has zero respect for men.

2278
02:17:14,610 --> 02:17:18,890
You know, I came home on Saturday
for, you know, with Max and uh,

2279
02:17:19,220 --> 02:17:22,460
so she had like a barbecue
with the spray tanning party,

2280
02:17:23,120 --> 02:17:27,000
but I wasn't allowed to film a look cause
they like got to get addressed and uh,

2281
02:17:27,050 --> 02:17:29,230
ms panties comes out,
you know,

2282
02:17:29,250 --> 02:17:33,560
just in her panties and I'm like,
I can't film this,

2283
02:17:33,980 --> 02:17:38,030
you know, I can't, you know, I need the
footage here. Right. Cause you know,

2284
02:17:38,031 --> 02:17:40,250
that's like the one thing, I
don't know, it's got going on.

2285
02:17:41,480 --> 02:17:44,300
You know the back,
we've got a big ass,

2286
02:17:44,720 --> 02:17:48,140
this is a guy that on Twitter that says
that Kim Kardashians actually got an x

2287
02:17:48,141 --> 02:17:52,570
ray of her ass to show and prove that
it's real. He did that. His name is right.

2288
02:17:52,600 --> 02:17:55,520
Well you know what? Then she's just
eating too much ranch dressing.

2289
02:17:55,550 --> 02:17:59,660
I'll say it again, Ryan. I mostly, Nah,
I'm just know what it does is my wife,

2290
02:18:00,770 --> 02:18:04,550
how come there's, how's there ever
picture with the picture come from?

2291
02:18:04,570 --> 02:18:09,380
It's on I your wife, you
have a fun dumper. Yeah.

2292
02:18:09,381 --> 02:18:13,850
You see what I mean? And
so there's another one.

2293
02:18:14,370 --> 02:18:17,910
Look at it. Oh my God, Valerie.
I thought there was only one.

2294
02:18:17,970 --> 02:18:20,460
Is there any more full of shit?
You told us about it.

2295
02:18:20,490 --> 02:18:24,360
You knew he was going to search for it.
Girls are so God damn predictable.

2296
02:18:25,150 --> 02:18:28,750
You're seeing my nice body and
the photographic form online.

2297
02:18:29,310 --> 02:18:33,420
I told you it was online and now you're
looking at it. That's crazy up there.

2298
02:18:33,870 --> 02:18:37,560
I don't care. I do the picture
for us. You do care. So

2299
02:18:39,060 --> 02:18:44,060
just say with the fucking Facebook
and you wanted beauty is pain.

2300
02:18:45,770 --> 02:18:46,790
Pain.
Hello?

2301
02:18:46,920 --> 02:18:50,820
Oh, okay. You wanted every
once in a PGW about them.

2302
02:18:51,510 --> 02:18:55,860
Isn't that a code? Shows cost her.
Fuck. This shows a total cluster.

2303
02:18:55,861 --> 02:18:57,460
Fuck you like the olive garden.

2304
02:18:59,980 --> 02:19:04,140
No girls, no gross. Why
no girl dice not allowed

2305
02:19:05,740 --> 02:19:07,880
too much animosity.
Too much history between the jars.

2306
02:19:07,881 --> 02:19:10,970
Too much crossover where you
don't realize it's a podcast.

2307
02:19:10,971 --> 02:19:14,200
You both talk at the same time. It's
too crazy. I'm trying to pull out.

2308
02:19:14,920 --> 02:19:19,680
He's got to like see how you
just overlapping. Oh, you will.

2309
02:19:19,710 --> 02:19:23,460
You just overlapping.
Guess who's fired?

2310
02:19:23,560 --> 02:19:28,100
Jesus was fired. Now you're fired.
That dice man to Saint Charles,

2311
02:19:28,101 --> 02:19:31,830
Illinois. Andrew dice clay,
showtime special, the arcade.

2312
02:19:31,831 --> 02:19:35,570
A theater on set. You don't steal
my employees, man. Saturday,

2313
02:19:35,571 --> 02:19:39,170
August 25th the arcade,
a theater go to oh shows.

2314
02:19:39,171 --> 02:19:44,171
That's o s h o w s.com all or call the
theater at (630) 962-7000 you want to be

2315
02:19:47,781 --> 02:19:50,600
there. You want to be there for history.
He says this is his last special.

2316
02:19:50,690 --> 02:19:53,630
I say bull shit because it was
anything like what I saw in Vegas.

2317
02:19:53,631 --> 02:19:57,640
People gonna fucking demand you produce
more. It's not that I'm that retirement

2318
02:19:59,170 --> 02:20:02,390
plan on touring a lot. Good. It's weird
if that's what I really wanted to listen.

2319
02:20:02,391 --> 02:20:06,590
That's what I want to say, man.
It was a fucking artist in Vegas.

2320
02:20:06,591 --> 02:20:10,010
I was just going to say it's, I, I, I
love that there's guys like you out there.

2321
02:20:10,040 --> 02:20:14,980
It's, it's so important to me as a, as a
person who loves standup comedy and as,

2322
02:20:15,080 --> 02:20:18,440
even if I never did stand up again in
my whole life. I'm a fucking fan of it.

2323
02:20:18,441 --> 02:20:20,590
I love it and you're going to see a lot.
Thank you.

2324
02:20:20,600 --> 02:20:24,740
It's really fun and don't think,
I didn't love that you guys were there.

2325
02:20:24,980 --> 02:20:28,040
I know when your,
when your fellow comics come to see you,

2326
02:20:28,460 --> 02:20:29,660
you know it's like exciting.

2327
02:20:29,661 --> 02:20:34,661
So you know that what that show was for
you when the guys know that performance

2328
02:20:34,851 --> 02:20:38,000
was about you and the guy couldn't care
less if everybody else left the room.

2329
02:20:38,540 --> 02:20:42,050
It fires me up creatively
when I go see a show.

2330
02:20:42,051 --> 02:20:46,160
Like the last time I saw show up before
yours was Norton's and it just gets me

2331
02:20:46,161 --> 02:20:49,520
so fired up to them to perform
and to right. You know?

2332
02:20:49,521 --> 02:20:50,630
And I think whether we really,

2333
02:20:50,750 --> 02:20:54,500
comics really feed off other comics
and we get inspired by other comics.

2334
02:20:54,650 --> 02:20:58,400
So the really be able to sit down and
have to watch a real show was really a lot

2335
02:20:58,401 --> 02:20:59,750
of time, a lot of fun. Man.

2336
02:20:59,751 --> 02:21:02,960
I just want to say thank you and thanks
to Eleanor for interrupting whatever

2337
02:21:02,961 --> 02:21:06,910
Dyson. Everybody knows we were
kidding. Just kidding. Come on, we,

2338
02:21:06,920 --> 02:21:07,970
everybody knows we were kidding.

2339
02:21:10,490 --> 02:21:13,520
And Eleanor really is. I mean, I
don't know how much better you got,

2340
02:21:13,521 --> 02:21:17,220
but when I saw you in Irvine, which was
more than two years ago, I'm almost,

2341
02:21:17,730 --> 02:21:21,200
well February, it'll be six years.
I was really blown away. I mean,

2342
02:21:21,201 --> 02:21:22,820
you were really professional already.
Yeah,

2343
02:21:22,850 --> 02:21:27,490
but you know what it was is like you saw
so much shit comedy. You saw so many.

2344
02:21:27,491 --> 02:21:27,830
Yeah.

2345
02:21:27,830 --> 02:21:32,830
You saw so many old dying road hacks that
will do the same act for decade after

2346
02:21:32,931 --> 02:21:35,570
decade.
Do Nixon jokes and shit and you be like,

2347
02:21:36,230 --> 02:21:41,200
it's 2000 it's 2000 and people
were doing jokes about Ford.

2348
02:21:41,210 --> 02:21:42,530
Nobody knows who Ford is.

2349
02:21:42,620 --> 02:21:46,460
Mrs. Back when Eleanor was working
there and you know you were, it's,

2350
02:21:46,461 --> 02:21:49,070
it's awesome that you're doing comedy
because it was beautiful to watch you and

2351
02:21:49,071 --> 02:21:51,740
stay there at night. I was like,
finally, you know, and nailed it after

2352
02:21:54,700 --> 02:21:56,540
Andrew's house and all this bullshit.

2353
02:21:56,540 --> 02:21:59,120
She always wanted to do
comedy and she's great at it.

2354
02:21:59,300 --> 02:22:02,790
You gotta do it yourself every
night before she goes on. We, we,

2355
02:22:02,810 --> 02:22:05,000
we pound each other,
you know,

2356
02:22:05,001 --> 02:22:08,540
and I opened the cart and I never
miss a show no matter what's going on.

2357
02:22:08,990 --> 02:22:11,600
And it's just so great to,

2358
02:22:11,660 --> 02:22:16,370
to have like the feeling that I know my
open is going out and kill in. Right.

2359
02:22:16,430 --> 02:22:20,420
And it's just somebody that happens to
be family to me, you know what I mean?

2360
02:22:20,421 --> 02:22:25,290
And then of course with Max and now
we've got la rocks and my boys had just

2361
02:22:25,291 --> 02:22:26,490
fucking slamming it.

2362
02:22:26,610 --> 02:22:29,220
I've been trying to tell all my comedian
friends that hate the road. I'm like,

2363
02:22:29,221 --> 02:22:31,980
you got to go out with other friends.
You got to go out with your goal.

2364
02:22:32,490 --> 02:22:34,110
The only way to do it,
you're wasting your time.

2365
02:22:34,260 --> 02:22:37,950
If you go out and you work with some
local headliner who wants to blow you off

2366
02:22:37,951 --> 02:22:41,010
the stage. Yeah. And they, and they
step on your material on purpose.

2367
02:22:41,040 --> 02:22:42,540
I mean it happens to a lot of my friends,

2368
02:22:42,541 --> 02:22:45,780
they'll do gigs and the guy will see
their act the first night and the second

2369
02:22:45,781 --> 02:22:47,760
night they bring up the
same subjects on purpose.

2370
02:22:47,880 --> 02:22:49,500
Who tried to kill their best bits?
Yeah.

2371
02:22:49,501 --> 02:22:53,550
Cause they want to have a better set
than you. He knows he's from Brooklyn,

2372
02:22:54,430 --> 02:22:57,230
very spoiled being with Andrew very well.

2373
02:22:57,870 --> 02:23:02,870
Of course he lets me do my own thing
and the crowd. I always tell him

2374
02:23:04,850 --> 02:23:08,640
I never give up. I never give her
time. I just say, when you peek,

2375
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:10,030
just get off this.

2376
02:23:10,031 --> 02:23:12,720
I'm going to say right now you
guys both together need a podcast.

2377
02:23:12,721 --> 02:23:14,700
You know fucking easy. It
would be, this is all you need.

2378
02:23:14,701 --> 02:23:19,470
This is all you need is an
iPhone. You on a plane, so listen,

2379
02:23:19,471 --> 02:23:23,370
listen, you were on a plane, you are
in a restaurant. You where you're,

2380
02:23:23,400 --> 02:23:26,160
you're in your hotel room wherever
you are, you having an argument,

2381
02:23:26,220 --> 02:23:27,180
turn on your iPhone,

2382
02:23:27,360 --> 02:23:31,710
turning a fucking iPhone and record the
argument and they just put dice versus

2383
02:23:31,711 --> 02:23:35,460
Eleanor and put on iTunes and the,
anytime you guys get in an argument,

2384
02:23:35,670 --> 02:23:40,200
you record dice versus Neller and
have it a fucking long running gag.

2385
02:23:40,380 --> 02:23:43,740
The real arguments, you can't fake
your arguments, but then that would be,

2386
02:23:44,070 --> 02:23:45,750
that would be hilarious.

2387
02:23:45,751 --> 02:23:49,100
It's going to get yelled at for
just talking at the same time,

2388
02:23:49,140 --> 02:23:51,150
not letting somebody,
well Brian Callen,

2389
02:23:51,280 --> 02:23:55,170
crystally and a will Sasso have this
10 minute podcasts. It's a great idea.

2390
02:23:55,171 --> 02:23:56,670
It's only 10 minutes.
So with you guys,

2391
02:23:56,671 --> 02:23:58,490
you'd never know what kind of
an argument you're into it.

2392
02:23:58,491 --> 02:24:02,960
It might be a half an hour. It
might be the podcast Mike. Oh,

2393
02:24:04,010 --> 02:24:07,010
but it's fun for, I'm annoyed
me more. I'm thinking no

2394
02:24:08,660 --> 02:24:09,740
dice versus

2395
02:24:11,980 --> 02:24:16,500
right maximum at the pool or
the boss. Yeah, that's right.

2396
02:24:16,501 --> 02:24:18,560
I'm the bowl.
Come.

2397
02:24:18,600 --> 02:24:22,380
My son knows when to talk and
when not to ice versus Eleanor.

2398
02:24:22,700 --> 02:24:27,000
You just go and go and go and then
it's the thread of Deborah. Oh,

2399
02:24:27,001 --> 02:24:30,840
tell my brother. Ds me at.

2400
02:24:30,870 --> 02:24:33,180
Are you going to be quiet for
a moment here? Thanks dice.

2401
02:24:33,181 --> 02:24:36,720
Thanks for doing the show.
I really appreciate it.
Welcome Joe. A longtime fan.

2402
02:24:36,721 --> 02:24:37,890
It's an honor to be your friend.

2403
02:24:37,891 --> 02:24:40,080
It's an honor to have you on
and I feel the same exact way,

2404
02:24:40,081 --> 02:24:43,980
but we would love to have full
desk quad support of the dice. Man,

2414

Thanks to [inaudible] dot com
for supporting our podcast.

2415
02:25:20,641 --> 02:25:24,790
Thanks to Alienware for sponsoring us and
giving these bad ass fucking computers

2416
02:25:25,300 --> 02:25:28,060
and most important that sponsored and
that's rather it be providing us with

2417
02:25:28,061 --> 02:25:30,400
computers. But you know what,
I'll use one if they give me one.

2418
02:25:30,660 --> 02:25:33,400
Well I'll get you one. I'll get
you one. I'll use that. They uh,

2419
02:25:33,430 --> 02:25:36,730
they would love to have you use them
there. Um, they support this wood.

2420
02:25:36,750 --> 02:25:39,680
What's important to me. They sponsor a
lot of fighters of his lungs are a lot.

2421
02:25:39,700 --> 02:25:43,480
I love make up the little face. Yeah,
me too. And he said a lady bug? No,

2422
02:25:43,481 --> 02:25:44,220
it's an alien.

2423
02:25:44,220 --> 02:25:46,660
Oh Shit. Oh No. Cause it's,

2424
02:25:48,210 --> 02:25:51,990
it looks like an alien should make
a dice model. That's a lady bug.

2425
02:25:53,280 --> 02:25:55,740
Um, it's a, it's a great computer.
If you'd like to play games,

2426
02:25:55,850 --> 02:26:00,000
they want to play games. It's literally
like a desktop computer. Excuse me,

2427
02:26:00,001 --> 02:26:03,720
a desktop gaming computer that you can
carry around with you, which most laptops,

2428
02:26:03,810 --> 02:26:08,310
they don't have the uh, the,
the horsepower to, to deliver
like highspeed graphics.

2429
02:26:08,340 --> 02:26:10,270
So when you play games on them,
they look shitty and colon.

2430
02:26:10,290 --> 02:26:15,170
But like you could go to my space
and everything. Tell him email. Yeah.

2431
02:26:15,180 --> 02:26:17,330
You go to Friendster and you get
to do whatever you gotta do it.

2432
02:26:20,620 --> 02:26:25,350
Yeah. You can check out,
check out your AOL mail. Yeah,

2433
02:26:25,351 --> 02:26:28,880
you can do whatever you want with it.
It's a real computer windows. It's a,

2434
02:26:28,890 --> 02:26:30,900
it's a great computer. Look at
that. And as far, like I said,

2435
02:26:30,901 --> 02:26:33,520
as far as gaming computers, they're
top of the food. You have one.

2436
02:26:34,360 --> 02:26:39,250
They give you one? Yeah, he's got a three.
So, um, what's the guy's name? Uh, well,

2437
02:26:39,330 --> 02:26:41,580
the guys deal with this.
His name is Cody from Alienware.

2438
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:45,450
Brian Butler from some Sucker Punch and
attainment. I need like three of them.

2439
02:26:45,900 --> 02:26:49,260
Three of them. Listen. Well,
no, cause they need to use them.

2440
02:26:49,380 --> 02:26:52,740
I'm going to show a lot of people,
maybe if you start a podcast or something,

2441
02:26:52,770 --> 02:26:55,290
they'll hook you up with three. It's
going to be hard to get three out of them,

2442
02:26:55,750 --> 02:26:59,660
but they probably got them in the trunk.
You know what I mean? Maybe. I don't know.

2443
02:26:59,661 --> 02:27:00,270
You know what I mean?

2444
02:27:00,270 --> 02:27:02,850

What Joe Rogan? Yes.

2448
02:27:12,481 --> 02:27:15,450
Did you know there's certain substances
have been shown to increase the fucking

2449
02:27:15,451 --> 02:27:19,150
strength of your bones on go get
yourself some kettlebells, gay guy.

2450
02:27:19,151 --> 02:27:22,590
You know what? The kettle bells and
I take a couple of them, that's me.

2451
02:27:22,620 --> 02:27:27,120
I sell them. Oh, you sell, you'll brand
that like robot. We sell them on on it.

2452
02:27:27,180 --> 02:27:31,710
I'm a part owner and on at.com
double J. Kettle bull, kettle balls,

2453
02:27:31,740 --> 02:27:35,820
kettle ball, and then it's kettle,
but it's kettle. Get a bowl. Oh yeah.

2454
02:27:35,821 --> 02:27:38,550
But you can have the
McDouble j kettle balls.

2455
02:27:38,730 --> 02:27:41,520
I don't think he didn't want to
hear that. I can pull, you know,

2456
02:27:41,521 --> 02:27:43,950
and you give it like the
look Brian, you silly, silly,

2457
02:27:43,951 --> 02:27:48,080
silly bitch on a Dotcom for supplements.
Use a code name Brogan.

2458
02:27:48,100 --> 02:27:50,820
Try out the new hemp force protein
powder to answer questions.

2459
02:27:50,821 --> 02:27:54,900
No Ham force will not make you
taste test positive for THC.

2460
02:27:55,020 --> 02:27:58,800
You could take hemp force. It has no
psychoactive substance in it whatsoever,

2461
02:27:58,801 --> 02:28:02,880
but it does have Maca,
which makes your dick hard and raw cocoa,

2462
02:28:02,881 --> 02:28:07,000
which is a powerful antioxidant and
it's sweetened by Stevia. So it's all,

2463
02:28:07,010 --> 02:28:10,950
it's only one gram of sugar per serving
and it's fucking tastes delicious and

2464
02:28:10,951 --> 02:28:15,330
it's really easy to digest. It's, it's
not, it's not cheap stuff. It's expensive,

2465
02:28:15,480 --> 02:28:17,670
but it's the highest quality
stuff that we could sell.

2466
02:28:17,700 --> 02:28:20,460
Can I ask you something
about that? Sure. That's,

2467
02:28:20,790 --> 02:28:25,460
it doesn't have like that stuff
in it that you shouldn't have. No,

2468
02:28:25,461 --> 02:28:28,400
there's no artificial sweeteners in it.
It's always sweetened by Stevia,

2469
02:28:28,401 --> 02:28:30,140
which is actually just a plant extract.

2470
02:28:30,290 --> 02:28:33,470
But what about lately have fed over
stuff and all? No, no, no. None of that.

2471
02:28:33,530 --> 02:28:34,780
None of that.
It's all going after that.

2472
02:28:34,790 --> 02:28:39,590
Then what it is the best plant based
protein powder you can buy and it's the

2473
02:28:39,591 --> 02:28:42,720
most easily digestible protein powder.
It doesn't give you any bloating.

2474
02:28:42,721 --> 02:28:46,150
And I love whey protein powder.
I love like muscle milk and those things.

2475
02:28:46,151 --> 02:28:49,010
They're delicious. But they make
me Fart, man. They, they're,

2476
02:28:49,060 --> 02:28:51,380
they like give you a bloated feeling.
Sometimes.

2477
02:28:51,470 --> 02:28:55,280
It's not the same clean feeling that I
get when I eat a hemp protein powder.

2478
02:28:55,281 --> 02:28:57,720
I think it's one of the most
easily digestible. But, uh,

2479
02:28:57,740 --> 02:28:59,150
if you're interested in any of this stuff,

2480
02:28:59,151 --> 02:29:01,760
go to [inaudible] dot com for supplements.
Use a code name Brogan.

2481
02:29:01,910 --> 02:29:05,780
Save yourself 10% off for battle ropes
and kettle bells that that code name does

2482
02:29:05,781 --> 02:29:09,380
not work because we sell them
as cheap as is humanly possible.

2483
02:29:09,500 --> 02:29:12,410
They're the best quality,
athletic and sports equipment,

2484
02:29:12,440 --> 02:29:15,590
things that are available, and that's all
we're ever going to sell. If we sell it,

2485
02:29:15,591 --> 02:29:17,390
it's the best shit that we can get.

2486
02:29:17,480 --> 02:29:20,750
It's stuff that we would use
ourselves and with the supplements,

2487
02:29:20,751 --> 02:29:24,470
there's a 30 day, or excuse
me, for 31st order, 30 pills,

2488
02:29:24,620 --> 02:29:28,160
100% money back guarantee. You don't
even have to bring back the supplements.

2489
02:29:28,400 --> 02:29:30,860
You just say, I didn't like Alpha
brain. That's it. You're done.

2490
02:29:30,890 --> 02:29:32,540
You're going to like it
because it's fucking awesome.

2491
02:29:32,690 --> 02:29:36,710
Go to [inaudible] Dot Com o.N n I. T.
All right, you dirty freaks tomorrow.

2492

The great Everlast will join us and I'm
going to do a nighttime podcast with

2493
02:29:40,131 --> 02:29:43,190
Brian's best friend, Duncan Trussell.
We'll see dirty bitches soon.

2494
02:29:43,280 --> 02:29:46,940
And don't forget death squad Friday at

These shows have been fucking spectacular.

2499
02:30:03,740 --> 02:30:07,190
Never had better. Ice House chronicles
podcast. Never had better shows.

2500
02:30:07,340 --> 02:30:09,530
We're having the time.
I fucking lives here in Pasadena.

2501
02:30:09,560 --> 02:30:12,590
And it's mostly because of you
guys. I mean, we have to show up,

2502
02:30:12,591 --> 02:30:15,170
but if you guys didn't send
us so many positive tweets,

2503
02:30:15,290 --> 02:30:18,830
and if there wasn't such an awesome group
of human beings that meets us at every

2504
02:30:18,831 --> 02:30:21,710
city, all over the world, it wouldn't
