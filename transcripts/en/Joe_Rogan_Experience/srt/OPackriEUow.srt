1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:03,110
Ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:03,111 --> 00:00:03,660
man,

3
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:07,560
the Internet is a fucking crazy plays.

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,710
I need some positive uh,

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,480
positive stuff cause I fucked up today,

6
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:14,063
this morning,

7
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,950
got up this morning to my usual stuff,

8
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,180
checked my email,

9
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:19,650
handled some business.

10
00:00:19,651 --> 00:00:20,370
Uh,

11
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:24,420
it was sitting there drinking a little
Kombucha and I read my message board

12
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:27,580
and uh,

13
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:30,810
I read this plan parenthood thread.

14
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:33,850
I'm just tweeting and um,

15
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,060
I read about Dee,

16
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,770
I don't know if you guys
know what's going on.

17
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,173
The uh,

18
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:44,540
planned parenthood was they were accused
of selling fetuses and actually not

19
00:00:47,191 --> 00:00:52,191
just selling fetuses but making deals to
deliver more intact fetuses and talking

20
00:00:54,751 --> 00:00:55,690
about um,

21
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:57,970
the body parts as a,

22
00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:59,790
as line items.

23
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:00,661
And I was like,

24
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:01,140
well,

25
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:01,771
come on,

26
00:01:01,771 --> 00:01:02,850
that can't be real.

27
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:03,780
So a,

28
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:04,381
call me,

29
00:01:04,381 --> 00:01:08,190
Pete is the gentleman who put it up
on the website on the message board.

30
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,840
If you're having a problem,

31
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:11,010
join that message board.

32
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:11,843
By the way.

33
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:16,380
We switched hosts and there was
just a giant fuck up along the way.

34
00:01:16,381 --> 00:01:17,041
And along the way,

35
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:22,041
there was some fun around
13,000 spam accounts signed up.

36
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:24,210
They were just fake,

37
00:01:24,211 --> 00:01:25,530
like a bunch of numbers,

38
00:01:25,531 --> 00:01:25,981
like six,

39
00:01:25,981 --> 00:01:26,251
seven,

40
00:01:26,251 --> 00:01:27,031
eight nine 10,

41
00:01:27,031 --> 00:01:28,590
six seven eight nine 10 11,

42
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:29,011
six,

43
00:01:29,011 --> 00:01:30,090
seven eight nine 10 11,

44
00:01:30,091 --> 00:01:32,100
12 like that kind of shit
like a bunch of them.

45
00:01:32,101 --> 00:01:34,650
So we have to figure out a
way to filter that stuff out.

46
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:35,511
But we'll,

47
00:01:35,511 --> 00:01:37,260
we'll let people in soon anyway,

48
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,280
the video,

49
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:38,730
uh,

50
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:40,170
if you want to search for the video,

51
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:41,820
the video on youtube,

52
00:01:41,821 --> 00:01:43,140
if you really want to watch it,

53
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,453
it's intact.

54
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:45,930
Fetuses in quotes,

55
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,680
just a matter of line items
for planned parenthood.

56
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:53,880
So I watch it and the video's disturbing.

57
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:54,391
First of all,

58
00:01:54,391 --> 00:01:58,470
it's disturbing the way this woman is
talking about fetuses and you know,

59
00:01:58,471 --> 00:01:58,681
it's,

60
00:01:58,681 --> 00:02:01,950
it's Kinda creepy the way
she's talking about the,

61
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:02,340
uh,

62
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,970
there's buyers that want
these specimens and their,

63
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:09,570
I guess their for medical
tasks or for scientific tests,

64
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,830
it's hard to,

65
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:16,290
it's hard to sit through the whole thing
and then they get deep into video and

66
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:20,580
that's where it gets really fucking
disturbing because the people that are

67
00:02:20,581 --> 00:02:25,581
buying ask if they can see some of the
product or some of the samples I think is

68
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:27,540
the word they used.

69
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,790
So the woman says,

70
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:34,791
well from the abortion say they're all
just in like a big pile and they say,

71
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:35,161
well,

72
00:02:35,161 --> 00:02:35,581
it's okay.

73
00:02:35,581 --> 00:02:36,001
We just,

74
00:02:36,001 --> 00:02:36,211
you know,

75
00:02:36,211 --> 00:02:37,320
we would like to go see him.

76
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,200
So they go to this pile and um,

77
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:47,330
they start picking things out with
tweezers including fully intact arms with

78
00:02:47,911 --> 00:02:48,744
hands,

79
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,600
like a little baby arm that's maybe,

80
00:02:51,601 --> 00:02:52,081
you know,

81
00:02:52,081 --> 00:02:53,370
an inch and a half long,

82
00:02:53,371 --> 00:02:57,390
two inches long with fingers and um,

83
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:57,871
you know,

84
00:02:57,871 --> 00:02:58,860
they're talking about it

85
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,060
just like you would talk about
like how you grow tomatoes.

86
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:04,600
Like,

87
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:04,781
well,

88
00:03:04,781 --> 00:03:06,640
if you get tomatoes that
are like six weeks old,

89
00:03:06,641 --> 00:03:07,271
they look like that.

90
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:09,070
If you get them to their
12 weeks old to get more,

91
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:09,933
more parts,

92
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:10,931
dude,

93
00:03:10,931 --> 00:03:15,931
it's fucking really disturbing because
they're pulling these things out with

94
00:03:15,971 --> 00:03:16,450
tweezers.

95
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:16,601
Oh,

96
00:03:16,601 --> 00:03:17,650
this is a lung.

97
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:18,131
Oh,

98
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:18,964
was that,

99
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,630
can he,

100
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,680
can he see the Thalamus?

101
00:03:20,681 --> 00:03:20,801
Well,

102
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:22,030
it's hard to tell him this big pile.

103
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:23,890
It's a pile of parts man.

104
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:24,950
And it,

105
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:25,390
it,

106
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:26,223
first of all,

107
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:29,830
if you've ever had an abortion and
you know someone's had an abortion,

108
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,560
we've had a girlfriend or you personally,

109
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:33,963
um,

110
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,750
you don't think about what
exactly is going on there.

111
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:40,960
But when you look at
this pile of these parts,

112
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:45,990
you're forced to recognize exactly what
it is and then you forced to wonder

113
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,610
what's going on through the minds of
these people that are just talking about

114
00:03:51,611 --> 00:03:54,160
them and referring to them in quotes.

115
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:56,530
Just a matter of line items.

116
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:02,070
And this is fucking pile of baby parts
that they sucked out of a woman's body or

117
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:04,960
a bunch of women's bodies.

118
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:06,363
It's disturbing.

119
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,321
I,

120
00:04:07,321 --> 00:04:07,670
uh,

121
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:09,330
I remember seeing this video because they,

122
00:04:09,331 --> 00:04:13,830
it was made for a recent bill or
something like that in Congress that,

123
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:14,460
that,

124
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:14,821
uh,

125
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:18,250
the antiabortion people
put as a shock video.

126
00:04:18,251 --> 00:04:21,750
I scare video and I thought
it was fully debunked.

127
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:22,260
Uh,

128
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,740
I didn't know that that
was actual real thing.

129
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,180
I was at Philly debunked.

130
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,083
Um,

131
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:32,310
I guess the video makes it show it was
supposed to be one of those like Gotcha

132
00:04:32,311 --> 00:04:33,060
videos,

133
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:33,451
uh,

134
00:04:33,451 --> 00:04:34,470
where it's,

135
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:35,341
it's,

136
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:40,020
it's mixing lies with like real stuff
that they actually do in the video.

137
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:40,650
And,

138
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:41,483
uh,

139
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,050
I thought for sure it was debunked,

140
00:04:43,051 --> 00:04:43,890
but maybe I was wrong.

141
00:04:43,891 --> 00:04:45,450
I didn't really look into it too much,

142
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:46,284
but I don't remember.

143
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:47,450
It was debunked.

144
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,090
Um,

145
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:52,010
and you can figure out a way to pull up
a link that says us debunk what planned

146
00:04:52,011 --> 00:04:56,930
parenthood hoax really proves right
wing extremis have no qualms about

147
00:04:56,931 --> 00:04:58,340
destroying people's lives.

148
00:04:58,341 --> 00:04:59,450
And when does this come out?

149
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,220
Uh,

150
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,160
this came out July 16th.

151
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:03,210
Um Hm.

152
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:05,250
This is that salon.com though,

153
00:05:05,251 --> 00:05:05,821
by the way,

154
00:05:05,821 --> 00:05:08,150
which is an insanely left wing side.

155
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:09,203
Yeah.

156
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:09,571
Um,

157
00:05:09,571 --> 00:05:11,480
so let's just Google it just to see.

158
00:05:11,481 --> 00:05:12,840
Planned parenthood video.

159
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:16,160
White House says planned
parenthood videos are fake.

160
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:16,701
Well,

161
00:05:16,701 --> 00:05:17,570
what's fake?

162
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:18,331
Yeah.

163
00:05:18,331 --> 00:05:18,660
I don't know.

164
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:18,811
I mean,

165
00:05:18,811 --> 00:05:20,310
it's not the real people.

166
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,380
Um,

167
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:22,950
okay.

168
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,540
New Planned parenthood video,

169
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:29,541
baby parts buyer jokes about shipping
severed heads two hours ago from the

170
00:05:29,761 --> 00:05:30,660
weekly standard.

171
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:32,250
This is a new video,

172
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:38,250
the latest undercover planned parenthood
videos and interview with Kate Dyer,

173
00:05:38,251 --> 00:05:43,251
CEO of an organization called stem
express that buys a boarded baby parts for

174
00:05:44,071 --> 00:05:46,620
planned parenthood and
sells them to researchers.

175
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,900
There are no graphic images in this video,

176
00:05:48,901 --> 00:05:50,100
but DIYers,

177
00:05:50,101 --> 00:05:53,520
comments about shipping
the severed intact.

178
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:54,360
Uh,

179
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,500
I don't know what that word is.

180
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,413
Cow

181
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,533
calve.

182
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:01,460
Cal-Vet for calvarium.

183
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,000
Calvarial hmm.

184
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:07,970
Calvarium calvarium or
skull of an aborted baby.

185
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:09,050
Uh,

186
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:11,540
our bone chilling stem express,

187
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:12,531
they say,

188
00:06:12,531 --> 00:06:12,741
uh,

189
00:06:12,741 --> 00:06:15,530
I know we get requests for neural tissue.

190
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,370
Uh,

191
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:17,810
it's the hardest thing
in the world to ship.

192
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,860
The buyer says,

193
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,753
uh,

194
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,530
you do it as a whole.

195
00:06:21,531 --> 00:06:24,710
Calvarial I guess that's the
whole head and stem expresses.

196
00:06:24,711 --> 00:06:25,544
Yeah,

197
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:26,060
that's it.

198
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:26,630
Yeah.

199
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:27,770
That's the easiest way.

200
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:29,030
And I mean,

201
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:32,000
we've actually had good
success with that in the past.

202
00:06:32,001 --> 00:06:32,631
Buyer says,

203
00:06:32,631 --> 00:06:33,320
yeah,

204
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,120
make sure the eyes are closed.

205
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:37,610
And then stem express loud,

206
00:06:37,611 --> 00:06:38,061
laughter,

207
00:06:38,061 --> 00:06:40,820
tell the lab it's coming so
they don't open the box and go,

208
00:06:40,821 --> 00:06:41,654
Oh God,

209
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,673
laughter.

210
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:43,610
So yeah.

211
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:47,330
Whereas so many of the academic
labs cannot fly like that.

212
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,800
They're just not capable.

213
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,761
Buyer says,

214
00:06:49,761 --> 00:06:50,690
why is that?

215
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:52,610
I don't understand that stem express as,

216
00:06:52,611 --> 00:06:55,070
it's almost like they don't want
to know where it comes from.

217
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:58,790
I can see that where
they're like in quotes,

218
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:02,630
we need limbs but no hands
and feet need to be attached.

219
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,300
We want to take it all off,

220
00:07:05,301 --> 00:07:06,620
like in quotes,

221
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,540
make it so that we don't know what it is.

222
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,433
Okay.

223
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:09,861
This is,

224
00:07:09,861 --> 00:07:10,694
um,

225
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:15,320
I don't know what his debunked and what's
not be bunked about that because it

226
00:07:15,321 --> 00:07:17,660
seems like in the conversation,

227
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:18,741
I mean,

228
00:07:18,741 --> 00:07:19,011
look,

229
00:07:19,011 --> 00:07:22,910
when they're digging through
that bag of baby parts,

230
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:24,650
which was the most disturbing part of it.

231
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:25,723
Um,

232
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:26,360
look,

233
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,620
if people are going to get abortions,

234
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:33,220
I personally do not have a problem with
them taking the aborted fetal tissue and

235
00:07:34,191 --> 00:07:35,810
using it for scientific experiments.

236
00:07:35,811 --> 00:07:38,990
Because the aborted fetal
tissue already exists.

237
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:42,500
They're already having abortions
and if abortions are legal,

238
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,610
shouldn't there be something done with
that aborted fetal tissue that may be

239
00:07:46,611 --> 00:07:48,170
beneficial to humanity?

240
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,020
Shouldn't there be a way
that they can experiment?

241
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:55,250
I mean it's not like they're asking people
to get abortions that would normally

242
00:07:55,251 --> 00:07:58,250
have kept the baby and loved them
and brought them to adulthood.

243
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,380
They're there,

244
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,680
they're going to have the abortions.

245
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,930
So if they are going
to have the abortions,

246
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:08,630
is it such a bad thing to use that fetal
tissue for scientific experimentation?

247
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:09,610
That's not the,

248
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:13,580
the disturbing part about it disturbing
part about is the visual aspect of

249
00:08:13,581 --> 00:08:14,300
seeing the

250
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:14,420
yeah,

251
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,420
the body position.

252
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,810
You shouldn't see that
is what pretty much sad.

253
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,861
But you know what,

254
00:08:18,861 --> 00:08:22,840
what this article on the Huffington post
is saying is that what they did is they

255
00:08:22,841 --> 00:08:25,090
took shocking video of,

256
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,481
you know,

257
00:08:25,481 --> 00:08:26,080
borsch things,

258
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,730
which is going to be disgusting anyways.

259
00:08:27,731 --> 00:08:30,520
And they're saying that planned
parenthood's making all this money off of

260
00:08:30,521 --> 00:08:32,410
selling all the parts to,

261
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:33,244
you know,

262
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:34,150
in,

263
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:36,640
in what planned parenthood
is saying is no,

264
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:37,900
we just donate it to the,

265
00:08:37,901 --> 00:08:38,400
to,

266
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,790
to science and,

267
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,150
and,

268
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:40,960
and,

269
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,360
and people that want to use
it for medical research.

270
00:08:43,361 --> 00:08:44,620
So that's not what was going on

271
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,400
video.

272
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:45,950
And the video,

273
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:49,120
the woman was talking about the amount
of money that they would get doing it and

274
00:08:49,121 --> 00:08:50,650
it was thousands of dollars a week.

275
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:52,290
And that's why they see this.

276
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:53,490
They're saying that's a hoax.

277
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,720
And they're saying that the,

278
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,130
what you're watching

279
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:57,960
wasn't what the audio was.

280
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:59,220
And uh,

281
00:08:59,280 --> 00:08:59,701
wait a minute,

282
00:08:59,701 --> 00:09:01,590
that doesn't make any sense
cause you see the woman's say it,

283
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:05,640
that group behind the videos is facing
at least two lawsuits because it's fake.

284
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:07,860
Is it an huff post?

285
00:09:07,861 --> 00:09:08,694
Huff Post.

286
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,650
Let's see here is on CNN.

287
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,050
And what does CNN saying?

288
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,130
They're saying it's a hoax too.

289
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:14,311
Yeah.

290
00:09:14,311 --> 00:09:17,280
There's a company created
to go against the left wing.

291
00:09:17,281 --> 00:09:18,660
I oversee a group called acorn.

292
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:20,100
And,

293
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:20,670
uh,

294
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:21,660
throughout this article,

295
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:22,790
it also says

296
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:25,010
the Acorn is the same
company that they were,

297
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,460
uh,

298
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,660
they were accused of,

299
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:27,770
they were trying,

300
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:32,770
people were trying to get funds
for creating prostitutes or for a,

301
00:09:33,441 --> 00:09:34,580
for pimping member.

302
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,690
Remember that whole
thing where there was a,

303
00:09:36,691 --> 00:09:38,300
a bunch of people that
are trying to get funds.

304
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:39,881
The first part here,

305
00:09:39,881 --> 00:09:44,881
it says there's a fake company set up
called biomax procurement services and

306
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:45,880
that was the hoax.

307
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:48,760
And then according to this is the
hoaxers website was a 30 month long

308
00:09:48,761 --> 00:09:52,480
investigative journalism study by the
center of Medical Progress documenting how

309
00:09:52,481 --> 00:09:54,850
planned parenthood it sells
body parts for board at babies.

310
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,530
Right.

311
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:55,930
Um,

312
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:56,763
that's not true.

313
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:57,933
That's not true.

314
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,133
They don't sell them.

315
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:00,340
It's flat out untrue.

316
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:02,211
So,

317
00:10:02,211 --> 00:10:05,220
well what was the woman in the
thing she was talking about body,

318
00:10:05,221 --> 00:10:06,010
right

319
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:06,780
radio.

320
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:09,410
They were baiting them into
conversations about others,

321
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:10,590
about sales selling stuff.

322
00:10:10,591 --> 00:10:11,790
It says that it really don't do that.

323
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:14,040
They were just trying to
get them to say it kind of

324
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,140
did get him to say it.

325
00:10:16,141 --> 00:10:17,250
So what is the deal?

326
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:20,790
She was talking about the bottom line
about how much money they could make and

327
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:22,680
how much money she could add to the,

328
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,560
so was she like a rogue
lady for planned parenthood?

329
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:26,463
That's what they're saying.

330
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:27,780
And they're also saying that like,

331
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:28,181
you know what I mean?

332
00:10:28,181 --> 00:10:31,030
This bill that was passing was going
to cut off all funding to planned

333
00:10:31,031 --> 00:10:31,551
parenthood.

334
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:35,590
So this was like a full on attack trying
to get rid of planned parenthood by

335
00:10:35,591 --> 00:10:36,610
anti-abortionists.

336
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:37,241
Jeremy,

337
00:10:37,241 --> 00:10:37,980
scroll back down.

338
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,270
We went back where you were again.

339
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,650
Um,

340
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:43,980
the details of the processes are enough
to trouble anyone nonmedical people

341
00:10:43,981 --> 00:10:45,690
don't talk about the price of requesting,

342
00:10:45,691 --> 00:10:49,230
removing or shipping Oregon's pieces
of flesh for the from place to place.

343
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:52,440
Most of us would freak out if we
listened to professionals and the local

344
00:10:52,441 --> 00:10:52,891
hospital,

345
00:10:52,891 --> 00:10:57,420
funeral home or medical examiners
office discuss details about how a dying

346
00:10:57,421 --> 00:11:01,470
person's request to have their body parts
donated for transplants or scientific

347
00:11:01,471 --> 00:11:02,970
research actually gets carried out.

348
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,620
It turns out that the cadavers livers,

349
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:05,760
okay.

350
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,640
They don't walk themselves over to the
local hospital or a medical school for

351
00:11:08,641 --> 00:11:09,120
free.

352
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:14,120
I just don't understand the outrage was
that for a lot of folks was that they

353
00:11:14,521 --> 00:11:16,980
were selling these a baby parts.

354
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:17,790
Right?

355
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:18,960
So that is or isn't true.

356
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:19,823
It's not true.

357
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,480
So why was that a woman
saying in the video?

358
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,790
Because it's a big hoax video.

359
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:25,300
That's why she has to give to Lawson.

360
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:26,141
But without,

361
00:11:26,141 --> 00:11:27,820
without further explaining,

362
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:31,330
is it because the woman was
actually saying those things?

363
00:11:31,331 --> 00:11:33,070
So what part is a hoax?

364
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:37,720
Because you were also sad that that
woman was kind of rogue because she was

365
00:11:37,721 --> 00:11:38,530
saying,

366
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:41,230
she was talking about how much
money they could make from it.

367
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:43,540
I'm really confused.

368
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:44,371
Like what is the hook?

369
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:47,230
So I understand that the people that were,

370
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,093
um,

371
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:52,600
that were making the video weren't really
what they were sending you saying they

372
00:11:52,601 --> 00:11:53,434
were right.

373
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:54,403
These people,

374
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:57,850
they set this up and they got
inside of planned parenthood.

375
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:00,160
The way they were going through the,

376
00:12:00,161 --> 00:12:00,670
um,

377
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:01,630
the body parts,

378
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,460
the way they were picking
up the body parts and,

379
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,450
but that was all real.

380
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:04,691
I mean,

381
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:05,590
there's 100% real,

382
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:06,670
the way there's,

383
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,241
there's no way.

384
00:12:07,241 --> 00:12:09,760
It wasn't unless they're rubber
baby parts and they had actors.

385
00:12:09,761 --> 00:12:10,411
Is there a chance to,

386
00:12:10,411 --> 00:12:11,820
the audio you were hearing wasn't what,

387
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:13,340
that's what they're
saying match up the video,

388
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,260
the people's faces.

389
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,490
You could see him saying it.

390
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:19,930
Me and Lizzie was just fucking brilliantly
done by terrorists that says that if

391
00:12:19,931 --> 00:12:20,980
you plow through the transcripts,

392
00:12:20,981 --> 00:12:22,780
you won't see what that,

393
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:23,450
I mean,

394
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:26,500
all this also could be talking about a
separate video from what you just saw

395
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:27,310
maybe.

396
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:28,720
But uh,

397
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,760
these fucking things are so,

398
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,920
so confusing.

399
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:39,510
So there's a new or newly released video
that just came out that's a literally

400
00:12:40,631 --> 00:12:41,590
two hours ago,

401
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:43,323
um,

402
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:48,520
online and this is the stem express CEO.

403
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,273
I don't know man.

404
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,293
It's um,

405
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:53,763
it's fucking,

406
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:54,490
it's just,

407
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:56,650
it's really one of those things.

408
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,030
Abortion,

409
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:01,990
it becomes one of those left or right
issues where you're either a left wing

410
00:13:01,991 --> 00:13:02,321
person,

411
00:13:02,321 --> 00:13:04,060
you support abortion or
you're right wing person.

412
00:13:04,061 --> 00:13:04,960
You'd think it's terrific.

413
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:05,951
I,

414
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:06,340
uh,

415
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,650
I support people's right to
do whatever they want to do.

416
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,980
I totally support people's
right to have abortions,

417
00:13:11,981 --> 00:13:13,480
but at a certain point in time,

418
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:16,420
like when is an abortion
completely fucked up?

419
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:19,660
Like when you have a nine month old baby
inside you and decide to kill it before

420
00:13:19,661 --> 00:13:20,520
it comes into your vagina.

421
00:13:20,521 --> 00:13:21,354
It's why it's illegal.

422
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:21,911
Yeah.

423
00:13:21,911 --> 00:13:25,450
But at a certain point in time that
baby's still viable outside the womb.

424
00:13:25,451 --> 00:13:26,830
But you could still have an abortion.

425
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:27,671
Yeah.

426
00:13:27,671 --> 00:13:28,630
What does it say?

427
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,670
And I mean they changed it so many times.

428
00:13:30,671 --> 00:13:31,210
I think it,

429
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,370
is it like six week or no,

430
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:34,271
it's something.

431
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:34,721
It's something,

432
00:13:34,721 --> 00:13:35,720
it's not too crazy.

433
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:36,690
Maybe it's six weeks.

434
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,410
It's like two or three months
or something like that.

435
00:13:38,411 --> 00:13:39,244
I think it's the most,

436
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:41,310
they were talking about 22 week old.

437
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:42,563
They were talking,

438
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:46,620
they were talking about like when you can
like really pick out Oregon's and when

439
00:13:46,621 --> 00:13:47,454
he could see them.

440
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:48,180
You know,

441
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:48,800
that's all.

442
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,250
That's fucking four,

443
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,240
eight,

444
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,110
12 I mean think about it,

445
00:13:52,111 --> 00:13:55,650
when you start going into at
six months old that's like,

446
00:13:55,651 --> 00:13:56,730
Whoa,

447
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:57,623
that's a,

448
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,070
that's a fucking baby.

449
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,830
I would really like to know
what this statistics is.

450
00:14:01,831 --> 00:14:02,930
If what you know,

451
00:14:02,931 --> 00:14:04,010
if you're going to get an abortion,

452
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:05,630
how long until you wait.

453
00:14:05,631 --> 00:14:06,464
Because I,

454
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:06,770
I,

455
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:08,030
it seems like most people I know,

456
00:14:08,031 --> 00:14:09,350
once they find out they're pregnant,

457
00:14:09,351 --> 00:14:09,681
they're like,

458
00:14:09,681 --> 00:14:11,420
next day I'm getting an abortion,

459
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:11,780
you know,

460
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,000
cause they had sex with you.

461
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:14,893
But

462
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:17,060
I wonder how many people are like,

463
00:14:17,061 --> 00:14:17,331
you know,

464
00:14:17,331 --> 00:14:18,380
like three months in like,

465
00:14:18,381 --> 00:14:18,890
you know what,

466
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:20,450
I think I don't want this baby.

467
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,940
That's when it gets kinda
creepy in my opinion.

468
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:23,501
Yeah.

469
00:14:23,501 --> 00:14:28,501
Well we all know people that
are completely irresponsible
and if you give them a

470
00:14:29,561 --> 00:14:34,561
way to justify anything and so they don't
have to take responsibility for it and

471
00:14:34,811 --> 00:14:35,200
just take,

472
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,033
take it out of me.

473
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:36,551
You know,

474
00:14:36,551 --> 00:14:38,530
they don't want to think if they
don't see it in front of them,

475
00:14:38,531 --> 00:14:39,700
they don't think of it as a baby.

476
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:42,070
The question really becomes,

477
00:14:42,071 --> 00:14:43,390
should you be allowed to do that?

478
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:45,430
And it's not my call.

479
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:47,110
I don't know who's called is.

480
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:47,950
I don't know.

481
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:49,600
I mean some people think it's their call,

482
00:14:49,601 --> 00:14:52,850
some people think that they should be
blown up abortion clinics and shooting

483
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:54,110
doctors and you know,

484
00:14:54,111 --> 00:14:57,320
they decided that they're there
to protect the children and uh,

485
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,810
that gets pretty fucked up too.

486
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,700
And it also gets pretty hypocritical
because those are the same kind of people

487
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:02,930
that are supportive of war.

488
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:03,681
You know,

489
00:15:03,681 --> 00:15:04,810
once your kid eats,

490
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,930
reaches 18 or if that
kids from another country,

491
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:08,550
fuck them.

492
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:10,070
Now this is weird,

493
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:10,820
but it was,

494
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,790
it was real weird looking
at the unescapable reality,

495
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:14,360
that video.

496
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,193
So whatever,

497
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:18,650
whatever's fake or real in the
conversations that they're having,

498
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,000
um,

499
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,140
there's no denying at
all those body parts.

500
00:15:24,141 --> 00:15:25,580
And that's where it gets really crazy.

501
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:26,420
Well,

502
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,740
we all knew that existed.

503
00:15:27,741 --> 00:15:27,831
I,

504
00:15:27,831 --> 00:15:28,280
you know,

505
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:28,880
when,

506
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,960
when you get an abortion,

507
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,490
what it usually is like a,

508
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:32,760
like a car wash,

509
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:33,370
like,

510
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:34,060
uh,

511
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:34,490
you know,

512
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:35,290
vacuum,

513
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:35,550
you know,

514
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:35,891
it's like a,

515
00:15:35,891 --> 00:15:38,330
it's a big tube and it
goes into like a humongous,

516
00:15:38,331 --> 00:15:42,170
like little pot or a at tank or whatever.

517
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:42,801
So,

518
00:15:42,801 --> 00:15:43,221
you know,

519
00:15:43,221 --> 00:15:46,070
if you're going to look in that tank
and you're going to see you just not,

520
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,240
you're not supposed to see it,

521
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:48,223
you know?

522
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:49,933
Well,

523
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:50,561
yeah.

524
00:15:50,561 --> 00:15:52,340
That's isn't that it's kind
of part of the problem,

525
00:15:52,341 --> 00:15:52,610
right?

526
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:53,780
They're not supposed to see it.

527
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:54,830
Yeah.

528
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:55,101
I mean,

529
00:15:55,101 --> 00:15:56,360
if you look at anything like that,

530
00:15:56,361 --> 00:15:56,961
you're going to be like,

531
00:15:56,961 --> 00:15:57,950
that's fucked up.

532
00:15:58,820 --> 00:15:59,121
Yeah,

533
00:15:59,121 --> 00:15:59,840
but it's,

534
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,790
that is the fuck

535
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:01,341
dup one,

536
00:16:01,341 --> 00:16:01,551
right?

537
00:16:01,551 --> 00:16:04,430
Because babies are helpless
and once they're alive,

538
00:16:04,431 --> 00:16:05,540
we want to take care of them.

539
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:09,920
And here you've got these people with
tweezers picking up arms with little

540
00:16:09,921 --> 00:16:11,060
fingers attached to it.

541
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:11,720
It's like,

542
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,710
Whoa,

543
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:15,260
whatever is in that video that's fake.

544
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:16,100
You know?

545
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:16,933
That's not,

546
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:17,750
that's,

547
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:18,230
that's,

548
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:19,190
that's terrifying.

549
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:20,920
I don't know.

550
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,753
You know,

551
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:23,180
I don't know what's a live,

552
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:28,290
I'll Google debunked and I'm sure
there's a a lot that tells you,

553
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:35,660
but it's just left wing sites are saying
it's debunked or right wing sites are

554
00:16:37,521 --> 00:16:39,800
continuing to promote it.

555
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:41,270
It gets really weird.

556
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:44,563
Ooh,

557
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:46,100
what a bummer.

558
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:46,371
What a,

559
00:16:46,371 --> 00:16:48,550
what a bad way to start
off the puck right now.

560
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:48,981
Yeah,

561
00:16:48,981 --> 00:16:49,610
that's what I saw.

562
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:51,140
That's how I started on my morning.

563
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,330
That and the Cecil,

564
00:16:53,331 --> 00:16:53,621
the lion,

565
00:16:53,621 --> 00:16:58,621
his cousin who killed a fucking safari
guide and the same in the same place

566
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,590
where Cecil the lion got killed.

567
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:05,540
This fucking guy was leading
walking photographic safari tours.

568
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:10,660
So the safari guide for the
walking photographic safari
tour got taken out by a

569
00:17:11,721 --> 00:17:12,554
lion.

570
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,491
The lion was like,

571
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:17,420
what are you doing outside the GP
dumped fuck and just just jacked him.

572
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,690
It's hilarious that people are that
stupid that they think they think they can

573
00:17:20,691 --> 00:17:25,691
walk around where lions are walking
around in this enormous enormous park in

574
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:27,800
Zimbabwe where lions are protected.

575
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:32,150
Have you ever been to one of those like
safari tours where like the animals come

576
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:35,420
right up and like the lines and the
monkeys just jump on your car or anything

577
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:36,030
like that?

578
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:36,481
Um,

579
00:17:36,481 --> 00:17:39,390
I've been to one of those wild animal
parks in New Jersey to do that.

580
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:40,681
It was a,

581
00:17:40,681 --> 00:17:41,514
it was real weird.

582
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:42,031
It just,

583
00:17:42,031 --> 00:17:43,140
it just feels goofy.

584
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:46,320
Like you're in your car and there's
monkeys jumping on your car and they'll

585
00:17:46,321 --> 00:17:47,610
break your windshield wipers.

586
00:17:47,611 --> 00:17:49,410
They do all kinds of
fucked up shit to car.

587
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:51,180
I don't even know if that
place is still open anymore,

588
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,370
but it's just,

589
00:17:53,371 --> 00:17:54,060
it's odd.

590
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:57,420
They would let you drive
around in your car and a,

591
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:00,900
you'd be on this tour
and that means better,

592
00:18:00,901 --> 00:18:02,010
I guess than the zoo.

593
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:06,450
But it's gotta be fucked
up for the monkeys because
it's like the same thing is

594
00:18:06,451 --> 00:18:07,950
looking at people through glass,

595
00:18:07,951 --> 00:18:12,510
except you're looking at people through
glass that moves on rubber wheels and

596
00:18:12,511 --> 00:18:15,720
you're just looking at these people
that are free and you're stuck in this

597
00:18:15,721 --> 00:18:18,750
enclosure and they're
driving into your house.

598
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:19,381
You know,

599
00:18:19,381 --> 00:18:20,250
they're on a road,

600
00:18:20,251 --> 00:18:21,420
but it said it was weird.

601
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,030
It's,

602
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:25,410
it's like there's something
fucked up about zoos.

603
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:27,660
Just something really
fucked up about zoos.

604
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:28,740
All of them,

605
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:29,730
you know,

606
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:31,500
less fucked up for some animals.

607
00:18:31,501 --> 00:18:34,890
Like my joke about giraffes that
giraffe seem to be pretty happy.

608
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:35,311
The zoo,

609
00:18:35,311 --> 00:18:36,600
like babies can feed them.

610
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:38,283
It's like,

611
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:39,330
it's true man.

612
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,530
My three year old,

613
00:18:40,531 --> 00:18:41,070
when she was,

614
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,390
well when she was three rather,

615
00:18:42,391 --> 00:18:45,750
we brought her to the zoo and she was
feeding giraffes with her hand and there

616
00:18:45,751 --> 00:18:46,710
was no worry at all.

617
00:18:46,711 --> 00:18:48,360
Everybody's laughing
and having a good time.

618
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:51,930
No giraffe has ever fucked up a
kid at the zoo for feeding it.

619
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,210
It'd be really interesting to see
if animals could talk to me like,

620
00:18:55,211 --> 00:18:55,601
no dude,

621
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:56,230
you don't understand.

622
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:58,750
I get to hang out here
to see people feed me.

623
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,190
I don't have to do shit here.

624
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:03,850
Like it might be the Cecil
the lion killer costume.

625
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:07,090
Is it coming out or it has come out.

626
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:07,510
Uh,

627
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:09,940
which is interesting that
they would actually do that.

628
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:14,320
It's actually a decapitated
lion with a dentist,

629
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:14,830
uh,

630
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:16,900
outfit with blood all
over the dentist outfit.

631
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:20,800
And the guy that owns the company said
that they've had so many requests for it.

632
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,000
So that,

633
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:27,360
I guess that's a thing that's this
hallway Halloween Cecil the lion cost of

634
00:19:27,461 --> 00:19:29,470
course that had to come out.

635
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:29,800
Yeah.

636
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,760
You knew that was coming out.

637
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:31,961
I mean,

638
00:19:31,961 --> 00:19:32,590
who?

639
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:33,880
Who didn't see that coming?

640
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,680
There it is Cecil.

641
00:19:35,681 --> 00:19:37,230
The lion splattered all over.

642
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:38,410
The guy's still in hiding.

643
00:19:38,411 --> 00:19:39,244
Huh?

644
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,450
Nobody's seen that dude.

645
00:19:40,451 --> 00:19:44,710
I think I heard just the other day
he opened up his business to know,

646
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:46,120
have you looked at her page?

647
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:47,163
That's not good.

648
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:48,340
I heard a,

649
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:51,760
I heard he was going to reopen
up his business in September.

650
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,811
That's Kinda fucked up.

651
00:19:52,811 --> 00:19:53,530
But Yelp,

652
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:56,170
because they're not even
reviewing his business.

653
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:57,940
They didn't go and yet their teeth,

654
00:19:57,941 --> 00:19:58,000
teeth

655
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,440
cleaned or io.

656
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,150
I hope I haven't looked lately,

657
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:03,130
but I hope Yelp stepped in because I mean,

658
00:20:03,131 --> 00:20:03,341
yeah,

659
00:20:03,341 --> 00:20:06,310
it got where it was just
deadlines and his like,

660
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,510
like photos.

661
00:20:07,511 --> 00:20:12,511
Whereas dentist office was his deadlines
and photos upload photos of sued,

662
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:14,771
stuff like that.

663
00:20:14,771 --> 00:20:15,091
This,

664
00:20:15,091 --> 00:20:17,200
this is my lion after I
brought it to the dentist.

665
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:17,621
Wow.

666
00:20:17,621 --> 00:20:21,460
So TMZ did a poll with
almost 16,000 votes,

667
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:23,800
if that was funny or
offensive about the Cecil.

668
00:20:23,801 --> 00:20:27,550
The lion costume in 66%
said that's offensive.

669
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,151
You know why?

670
00:20:28,151 --> 00:20:30,640
Because there's 66% of
people so fucking stupid.

671
00:20:30,641 --> 00:20:31,530
They post on CNN.

672
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:34,300
TMZ that those people are apes.

673
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,630
Those are people too dumb for Youtube.

674
00:20:37,631 --> 00:20:38,441
Like youtube is like,

675
00:20:38,441 --> 00:20:39,700
you're too stupid for our comments.

676
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:40,853
You got to go over,

677
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:43,030
you've got to go post over there.

678
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,033
What do you think?

679
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:48,280
Finally throwing one from my
opinion was thinking the fountain

680
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,420
because he's one of the beautiful animal.

681
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,900
Jimmy Kimmel cried.

682
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:55,260
Jimmy Kimmel crying,

683
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,750
I'm going to cry to Jimmy Kimmel
gave me the green light to grow.

684
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,650
It's pretty sad.

685
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:03,521
Well,

686
00:21:03,521 --> 00:21:04,354
it's fucked up.

687
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:09,220
It's fucked up that the only way to
save lions is to make them valuable for

688
00:21:09,221 --> 00:21:10,054
hunters.

689
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,530
That's ultimately,

690
00:21:11,531 --> 00:21:13,060
that's the most fucked up thing about it.

691
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:14,081
You know,

692
00:21:14,081 --> 00:21:15,340
that these people,

693
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,530
the idea that this is like,

694
00:21:17,531 --> 00:21:19,030
there's two types of,

695
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,880
of hunting for conservation
that kind of makes sense to me.

696
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:27,570
And the like when you have to kill certain
animals because they're killing other

697
00:21:27,701 --> 00:21:28,534
animals.

698
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:32,830
Like if you have too many lions and
you have to control the population,

699
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,090
but that's not really the case.

700
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:36,790
Like that kind of hunting for
conservation makes sense to me.

701
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:40,930
Or if there's like a lot of people
don't realize that that Rhino,

702
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,970
that that guy paid a
shitload of money to shoot.

703
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,680
They were going to kill that rhino anyway.

704
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,840
They had to kill that rhino cause
that rhino was killing other,

705
00:21:46,841 --> 00:21:47,674
the rhinos.

706
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,790
And when they do that,

707
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:49,490
they,

708
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:50,640
they have to uh,

709
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:53,080
this is a like a non-viable mail.

710
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,250
It's not breeding anymore.

711
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:58,120
And so it was attacking other males and
killing them and even tact female and

712
00:21:58,121 --> 00:21:58,451
killed it.

713
00:21:58,451 --> 00:22:00,130
They think so that's,

714
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:01,570
that's an animal they have to kill.

715
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:02,130
So if,

716
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:06,480
if you get a guy who's willing to
pay you a shitload of money to cook,

717
00:22:06,481 --> 00:22:09,730
kill that Rhino that you were already
going to kill and then that money goes to

718
00:22:09,731 --> 00:22:10,564
conservation.

719
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:11,650
That makes sense.

720
00:22:11,651 --> 00:22:13,900
So those are the two
cases we're hunting for.

721
00:22:13,901 --> 00:22:15,430
Conservation makes sense to me.

722
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:16,623
Other than that,

723
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:19,510
hunting for food is the only
thing that makes sense to me.

724
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:24,780
I don't get the idea of hunting like an
animal just because you want to like add

725
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:25,660
it to your collection.

726
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,780
I think that's kind of fucked
up unless it's the only thing.

727
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:30,610
The only time it makes sense
is that it has to be killed.

728
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:32,050
They don't have to kill those lines.

729
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:34,000
There's not enough of lions
that they have to kill them.

730
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,670
It's not like there's an
overwhelming number of lions,

731
00:22:36,671 --> 00:22:39,760
like they have to take them out because
they were eating each other like bears

732
00:22:39,761 --> 00:22:43,030
and Alberta I think got a real
problem with bears in Alberta.

733
00:22:43,031 --> 00:22:43,990
They have too many of them,

734
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,060
so that's why they let
you kill two of them.

735
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:46,751
They're like,

736
00:22:46,751 --> 00:22:48,970
please come up here and
kill some fucking bears.

737
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,470
They have a real problem with La,

738
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:53,590
with a wolves up there in a BC.

739
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:54,880
They don't even have a limit.

740
00:22:54,881 --> 00:22:56,940
You can kill as many wolves as you one PC.

741
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:59,080
They want you to kill him because
they're fucking everywhere.

742
00:22:59,081 --> 00:23:00,400
They kill people's cows.

743
00:23:00,401 --> 00:23:05,080
And those are the times we're hunting
for conservation makes sense to me.

744
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,520
But this lion thing,

745
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:07,121
these,

746
00:23:07,121 --> 00:23:10,390
these are rich dudes that want to go
over there and they want to fill their

747
00:23:10,391 --> 00:23:11,920
trophy rooms up and that's,

748
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,970
that's a real natural reaction
that people have that that's gross.

749
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:16,830
So just to like,

750
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:21,830
it's just so everyone knows I'm not on
the side of killing lions or anything,

751
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:22,721
giraffes,

752
00:23:22,721 --> 00:23:23,260
anything,

753
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,340
unless it's for food.

754
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:26,410
They say the thing about lines is like,

755
00:23:26,411 --> 00:23:27,400
they kill that Rhino.

756
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:28,810
Everybody ate that Rhino.

757
00:23:28,811 --> 00:23:30,670
The villagers came and they fucking,

758
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,200
they fed hundreds of people with that.

759
00:23:32,201 --> 00:23:32,591
Rhino.

760
00:23:32,591 --> 00:23:35,680
Rhino is apparently tastes good
like rhinos apparently or like,

761
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:36,850
like beef almost.

762
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,940
And that all these people
were excited to cut off,

763
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:40,480
uh,

764
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,820
pieces of that rhino and have protein.

765
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,530
Nobody's lining up to eat a lion.

766
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:46,790
You know,

767
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:47,623
that's stuff.

768
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:49,610
Apparently though
mountain lion tastes good.

769
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:55,100
Mountain lion supposedly tastes just
like pork and it's apparently something

770
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:56,900
that people have been eating since they,

771
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:57,440
uh,

772
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,720
since the pioneers came to America,

773
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:01,363
I never got it.

774
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:04,130
It's supposedly good with
like a blueberry sauce.

775
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,600
They make like Loin,

776
00:24:05,601 --> 00:24:07,070
like want mountain line loin.

777
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,173
I would try it.

778
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,250
I would definitely shoot
a fucking mountain line.

779
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:10,971
Those cons,

780
00:24:10,971 --> 00:24:11,151
eight,

781
00:24:11,151 --> 00:24:13,570
my dog and I don't like him.

782
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:14,540
I don't trust him.

783
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:18,240
They're just running around in our woods
and there was no shortage of me either.

784
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:19,550
Especially in California.

785
00:24:19,551 --> 00:24:21,290
California is so goofy.

786
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:25,610
They don't have a mountain lion season
in California because we don't have a

787
00:24:25,611 --> 00:24:27,860
department of fishing game in California.

788
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:30,170
We have a department of fish and wildlife.

789
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,710
It has a totally different like
nomenclature attached to it.

790
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:34,970
And because of that,

791
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:39,980
like it's run by like wildlife lovers
more than it's run by like hunting

792
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:40,910
advisers.

793
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,410
So like in every other state,

794
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,060
they look at the game numbers,

795
00:24:44,061 --> 00:24:45,500
they look at the mountain lions,

796
00:24:45,501 --> 00:24:47,870
they look at like and they
try to manage it accordingly.

797
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,260
And they also trying to manage it because
you get a lot of money from hunting

798
00:24:51,261 --> 00:24:53,060
tags and California,

799
00:24:53,061 --> 00:24:53,250
they,

800
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:54,830
they're less concerned with that.

801
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:59,360
And because of that they lose out on
a lot of money on hunting tags cause

802
00:24:59,361 --> 00:24:59,690
they'll have,

803
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:02,000
they'll have less hunters because
they literally have less deer.

804
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:04,810
And the reason why they have less direct
cause they have more mountain mines.

805
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:05,330
It's,

806
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:10,330
it's a real controversial thing with h
with the hunting in California as opposed

807
00:25:10,611 --> 00:25:11,750
to with every other state.

808
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:13,603
It's interesting.

809
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:14,990
It's all interesting stuff.

810
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,213
It's like what,

811
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:19,910
what people decide and not decide
that you can eat because there's all,

812
00:25:19,911 --> 00:25:21,050
or what you can kill.

813
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:24,470
Because in these places where
they have these hunting laws,

814
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:26,950
you can just drive down
the street like California,

815
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:30,320
drive down any street and you're just
going to pass by Jack in the box and

816
00:25:30,321 --> 00:25:33,650
burger king and chicken
places and they're filled.

817
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:34,340
Filled.

818
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:34,671
Yeah.

819
00:25:34,671 --> 00:25:35,380
California.

820
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:36,620
And finally has wolves.

821
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:37,161
Yay.

822
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:38,780
Great Wolf pack of wolves.

823
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,950
Fantastic wait fucking disaster.

824
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:44,690
We put him there or did they just kind of,

825
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:46,160
when we put them in Idaho,

826
00:25:46,161 --> 00:25:48,560
we put them in a lot of other states
and they're making their way down to

827
00:25:48,561 --> 00:25:49,340
California now.

828
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:52,400
And what's the purpose is having
wolves to take to kill these people are

829
00:25:52,401 --> 00:25:53,234
assholes.

830
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,133
They forget.

831
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:55,030
They forget.

832
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:55,340
Uh,

833
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:58,740
there was a story that I
tweeted the other day about um,

834
00:25:59,210 --> 00:25:59,931
famous,

835
00:25:59,931 --> 00:26:00,420
uh,

836
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:00,710
uh,

837
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:02,270
strong men throughout history,

838
00:26:02,271 --> 00:26:03,650
famous athletes throughout history.

839
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,840
And one of them was a guy who,

840
00:26:05,841 --> 00:26:06,050
uh,

841
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:06,861
tried to,

842
00:26:06,861 --> 00:26:07,310
uh,

843
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:12,020
split these two trees and he got stuck
in between the two trees and he got eaten

844
00:26:12,021 --> 00:26:12,854
by wolves.

845
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:16,281
This is like in the,

846
00:26:16,281 --> 00:26:16,551
you know,

847
00:26:16,551 --> 00:26:17,810
the BC days,

848
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:19,400
but the,

849
00:26:19,401 --> 00:26:19,671
I mean,

850
00:26:19,671 --> 00:26:22,520
we've talked about this
numerous times on the podcast.

851
00:26:22,521 --> 00:26:25,160
How many people throughout
history have been eaten by wolves?

852
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:30,380
That was a huge issue until people
started killing the fuck out of wolves.

853
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:33,050
And that's why we look at wolves now.

854
00:26:33,051 --> 00:26:34,400
Like there are dogs.

855
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,080
We'd look at them like their pets.

856
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:38,060
They were never pets before.

857
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,550
They were always these
terrifying animals that,

858
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:41,680
that,

859
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,070
that killed human beings.

860
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,780
That's why they were
always a part of folklore.

861
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:48,240
That's why they were always a part of
stories like the Little Red Riding Hood

862
00:26:48,241 --> 00:26:50,850
story or Goldie locks.

863
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:51,930
I mean there's always a,

864
00:26:51,931 --> 00:26:52,741
the three pigs,

865
00:26:52,741 --> 00:26:56,310
there was always stories of the big bad
wolf because wolves were something that

866
00:26:56,311 --> 00:26:57,570
everybody was really scared of.

867
00:26:57,930 --> 00:26:58,920
The wolves in Paris,

868
00:26:58,921 --> 00:27:01,650
story from the 14 hundreds wolves killed,

869
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:05,700
I think it was something
like 40 people in Paris,

870
00:27:05,701 --> 00:27:08,190
France in the 14 hundreds before they,

871
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:12,810
they fucking rallied together and
killed these goddamn things in.

872
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:14,130
During World War One,

873
00:27:14,131 --> 00:27:18,450
the Russians and the Germans
literally stopped shooting each other.

874
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:23,310
They had a cease fire so they could kill
wolves because there was so many people

875
00:27:23,311 --> 00:27:24,480
getting killed by wolves.

876
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:27,570
These soldiers would be on patrol
and they would never find them.

877
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:28,021
They're like,

878
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:28,531
what the fuck?

879
00:27:28,531 --> 00:27:32,100
And they'd go and they'd find like a
foot that was still stuck in a boat and

880
00:27:32,101 --> 00:27:33,990
their bodies would be
eat and wolves were just,

881
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,530
they were getting these super packs of
wolves of a hundred wolves together and

882
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:38,400
they would just kill people.

883
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:40,620
That's always been the case.

884
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:41,011
Just,

885
00:27:41,011 --> 00:27:45,810
we eradicated them from our lives and
we'd no longer have a threat of moles,

886
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:47,010
but now they,

887
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,090
they implanted them,

888
00:27:48,091 --> 00:27:50,820
they took them from Canada where
they have a real problem with them.

889
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:51,610
Where I do,

890
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:52,890
like I said in BC,

891
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,690
you can kill as many wolves as you want.

892
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:57,900
You can go to BC right now and
you can kill 50 wolves today.

893
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,490
If you could find 50 wolves,

894
00:27:59,491 --> 00:28:01,110
you can kill them all
and they want you to,

895
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:02,340
cause they're hard to kill.

896
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,241
They're hard to find.

897
00:28:03,241 --> 00:28:04,170
They're smart shit.

898
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:08,700
They worked together in packs and
they decimate moose populations.

899
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:09,301
Uh,

900
00:28:09,301 --> 00:28:10,710
they decimate elk,

901
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:11,963
deer,

902
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:12,751
cows,

903
00:28:12,751 --> 00:28:13,411
whatever the fuck.

904
00:28:13,411 --> 00:28:13,761
They get a hold,

905
00:28:13,761 --> 00:28:14,730
they'll eat your dog,

906
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:16,980
they'll eat everything they get
ahold of and that's what they do.

907
00:28:16,981 --> 00:28:17,551
They run around,

908
00:28:17,551 --> 00:28:18,384
they eat things.

909
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:19,373
So some,

910
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:25,310
I'm sure goofy liberal conservationists
decided to take these wolves and bring

911
00:28:25,921 --> 00:28:30,921
them from northern Canada and these big
ass fucking gray wolves and bring them

912
00:28:32,161 --> 00:28:33,870
down to a America.

913
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:36,780
Here's a picture that
Jamie just pulled out,

914
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,793
wolf attack,

915
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,150
scroll down so I can read that again.

916
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:39,780
Sorry.

917
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:44,250
Wolf attack leads to state of
emergency and Siberia's and Russia.

918
00:28:44,251 --> 00:28:46,410
Siberia region is two years ago,

919
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:49,200
there was 400 wolves in a
super pac running around.

920
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,033
She says,

921
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:54,270
fuck the governor of
Russia's largest reasons.

922
00:28:54,271 --> 00:28:57,030
Declared a state of emergency
after a surge of wolf attacks.

923
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,290
Fuck walls,

924
00:28:58,310 --> 00:28:59,100
man.

925
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,050
People are just so goofy.

926
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:05,700
We have this beautiful
thing that we've created.

927
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:08,190
We've created an amazing thing and cities,

928
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:09,180
you know,

929
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,620
you go to the grocery store,

930
00:29:10,621 --> 00:29:11,700
you get your food,

931
00:29:11,701 --> 00:29:12,840
you walked down the street,

932
00:29:12,841 --> 00:29:14,010
you hold hands with your kids.

933
00:29:14,011 --> 00:29:15,840
No one's looking over
their shoulder for bears.

934
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,011
And because of that,

935
00:29:17,011 --> 00:29:21,330
we have this real detachment from the
rest of the natural world that is outside

936
00:29:21,331 --> 00:29:22,164
of our cities.

937
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:27,660
And we live our whole lives and these
cities and our perspective of animals is

938
00:29:27,661 --> 00:29:29,850
completely shaped by these cities.

939
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:34,050
But these animals out there
don't give a fuck about you.

940
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,880
They don't give a fuck about your city.

941
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:38,490
They exist to eat and kill things.

942
00:29:38,491 --> 00:29:39,690
They don't have language.

943
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,950
They don't have culture.

944
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:41,800
They live.

945
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,030
They don't care about you.

946
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:46,900
And all our ideas about them
are all from the lion king.

947
00:29:46,901 --> 00:29:50,140
And some fucking goofy
ass cartoons and movies,

948
00:29:50,141 --> 00:29:53,410
the anthropomorphize
versions of these animals.

949
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:56,170
It's really ridiculous.

950
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:57,790
And that's where all the Cecil,

951
00:29:57,791 --> 00:29:59,560
the lion king shit comes from.

952
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:01,750
Cecil the lion king.

953
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:05,950
That's where all this
Cecil outrage comes from.

954
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,073
Meanwhile,

955
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:07,961
Justin Wren,

956
00:30:07,961 --> 00:30:12,961
who was on the podcast yesterday told
us that 5,000 children under the age of

957
00:30:13,121 --> 00:30:17,770
five die every day in
Africa from bad water.

958
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:19,660
Every day,

959
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:23,710
5,000 human babies die
because they don't have water.

960
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:27,520
And we're worried about
Elian that by the way killed.

961
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:32,700
Who knows how many other lions babies
because that's what they do when you see a

962
00:30:33,491 --> 00:30:38,491
male lion and he is successful and
he runs a pride Garr run fucking tee.

963
00:30:39,881 --> 00:30:44,440
That line has been killing baby male
lines cause that's what they do when the

964
00:30:44,441 --> 00:30:46,840
babies are born and it's not theirs,

965
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:48,850
they just fucking slaughter them.

966
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:53,230
They slaughter them when they go into a
new kingdom and they take over and they

967
00:30:53,231 --> 00:30:55,690
fucked some females and she's got males,

968
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:56,710
a little male babies,

969
00:30:56,711 --> 00:30:58,060
they fucking slaughter him.

970
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,650
They chased him down the Killam.

971
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:02,320
I put a video up of it on the,

972
00:31:02,321 --> 00:31:03,220
on Twitter.

973
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,420
People went crazy.

974
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:05,283
They went nuts.

975
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:08,080
Call me an asshole for
putting up a video of nature.

976
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:08,973
It's nature.

977
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:09,791
That is,

978
00:31:09,791 --> 00:31:11,080
this is what happens.

979
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:13,780
So these people that are happy now,

980
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,700
we finally have wolves in California.

981
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:16,983
It's amazing.

982
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:18,490
One day it'd be walking with you,

983
00:31:18,491 --> 00:31:21,730
a little cocker Spaniel and a wolf's gonna
come along and eat you and the cocker

984
00:31:21,731 --> 00:31:22,564
spaniel.

985
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:27,020
It's been a hundred years almost that
since we've had wolves in California.

986
00:31:27,021 --> 00:31:29,240
So I think that's what
they're more amazed at.

987
00:31:29,241 --> 00:31:29,780
Yeah,

988
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,450
these people are so fucking stupid.

989
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:33,070
Why don't they bring back dinosaurs?

990
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:37,060
We need more dinosaurs we can to
bring back titanosaurs to Arizona.

991
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:38,220
There was a,

992
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:43,180
it was an amazing place when dinosaurs
roamed these to fly phase to fly.

993
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,121
We're going to have cared.

994
00:31:44,121 --> 00:31:47,560
Terra doctorals launch our
first pterodactyl governor.

995
00:31:47,561 --> 00:31:48,250
Yay.

996
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:49,330
They're gonna open up the cage.

997
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:52,390
It's going to swoop right back.

998
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:53,343
Kill the governor.

999
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:55,991
They released,

1000
00:31:55,991 --> 00:31:59,650
somebody released a funny video where
they showed that photo of Steven Spielberg

1001
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:02,350
in front of the dinosaur and they
went to people on the street and go,

1002
00:32:02,351 --> 00:32:03,390
what do you think about that?

1003
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,590
Almost everybody was just like,

1004
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,990
I can't believe he did that.

1005
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:10,000
He should be held accountable,

1006
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:12,130
I guess in this fake trust.

1007
00:32:12,131 --> 00:32:12,670
Sarah top.

1008
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:13,300
Yeah.

1009
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:18,190
I guess Nestle a water just got caught
from stealing a bunch of natural water

1010
00:32:18,191 --> 00:32:19,390
and so a lot of people are,

1011
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:20,283
uh,

1012
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,450
protesting Nestle for stealing,

1013
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:23,140
um,

1014
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:25,870
California water while
we're in this huge drought.

1015
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:26,801
Yeah,

1016
00:32:26,801 --> 00:32:27,880
I guess that's real.

1017
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:28,571
Yeah.

1018
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:33,571
Nestle pays only $524 to extract 27
million gallons of California drinking

1019
00:32:36,011 --> 00:32:36,430
water.

1020
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:37,600
Come on.

1021
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:38,291
She's like,

1022
00:32:38,291 --> 00:32:40,190
for companies get exempt from that.

1023
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:43,820
A water ban on their blog
and they can sell it.

1024
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:44,241
Yeah.

1025
00:32:44,241 --> 00:32:49,241
The bottled water and alcohol and all
sort of kind of goofy deals have these

1026
00:32:49,641 --> 00:32:54,350
assholes made with politicians that they
could steal water during a drought and

1027
00:32:54,351 --> 00:32:55,640
then sell it to us.

1028
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:56,180
Yeah,

1029
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:56,931
that's insane.

1030
00:32:56,931 --> 00:32:58,490
For $524,

1031
00:32:58,491 --> 00:33:03,491
they stole 27 million gallons of water
from 12 springs and Strawberry Canyon for

1032
00:33:04,671 --> 00:33:05,504
the brand.

1033
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:07,580
Isn't that ridiculous?

1034
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,670
But yet we can't wash a car,

1035
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,450
take a phone over a five minute shower,

1036
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:12,500
corporate America,

1037
00:33:12,501 --> 00:33:13,334
folks,

1038
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:14,970
Corporate America.

1039
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:15,780
You know,

1040
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:19,140
corporations are beautiful
and a lot of ways,

1041
00:33:19,141 --> 00:33:19,291
I mean,

1042
00:33:19,291 --> 00:33:21,600
that's the root why we
have these microphones.

1043
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:24,420
It's why we have these laptops.

1044
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:26,700
It's why we have cell phones.

1045
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:28,260
It's all corporations that created them.

1046
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,940
But corporations,

1047
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,890
they're all about infinite growth.

1048
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,570
They constantly want to make more money.

1049
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,280
Every year they're supposed
to make more money.

1050
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:38,310
If a corporation makes you know,

1051
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:42,030
x amount of money one year and then the
same x amount of money the next year,

1052
00:33:42,031 --> 00:33:42,930
they're a failure.

1053
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:45,090
Which is hilarious.

1054
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,290
That's ridiculous.

1055
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,393
Like if they made,

1056
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:50,160
like if apple apple makes
like whatever they make,

1057
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:50,550
let's say,

1058
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:51,990
let's just make a number.

1059
00:33:51,991 --> 00:33:53,880
Apple made $4 billion this year,

1060
00:33:53,881 --> 00:33:54,420
right?

1061
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:56,310
If they make $4 billion next year,

1062
00:33:56,311 --> 00:33:57,144
they failed.

1063
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:01,320
You're supposed to make 4
billion plus the new money.

1064
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:02,701
It's incredible,

1065
00:34:02,701 --> 00:34:03,350
man.

1066
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:04,183
It says here,

1067
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:09,430
the most popular size bottle of arrowhead
is one liter and it retails for 89

1068
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:13,910
cents putting the potential profit
for Nestle in the tens of billions.

1069
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:19,970
So they're just making billions of dollars
on water that they've taken from ice

1070
00:34:19,971 --> 00:34:21,140
while we're going through a drought.

1071
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,850
It only costs 89 cents for
a one liter bottle of water.

1072
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,140
Why do I feel like it costs more?

1073
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,520
Because the vending machines,

1074
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:28,271
vending machines.

1075
00:34:28,271 --> 00:34:29,050
So he's like,

1076
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:29,351
oh yeah.

1077
00:34:29,351 --> 00:34:31,090
Fitting machines are a super over price.

1078
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:32,800
The whole thing is gross.

1079
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:33,813
It's gross,

1080
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:35,830
it's gross across the board.

1081
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:38,530
And it's also gross that like there's,

1082
00:34:38,531 --> 00:34:39,364
um,

1083
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:43,850
there's a lot of crops
that use this water and um,

1084
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:46,090
there's a lot of waste
involved apparently.

1085
00:34:46,390 --> 00:34:49,840
And there have been
bills that were passed,

1086
00:34:49,841 --> 00:34:51,610
like Arnold Schwarzenegger
when he was governor,

1087
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,760
said that they had come
up with a solution,

1088
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:55,570
um,

1089
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:57,160
at least a partial solution.

1090
00:34:57,460 --> 00:35:01,330
And he was bringing it up to one of the
other politicians and the politicians

1091
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:02,140
saying,

1092
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:04,120
even though this is an effective solution,

1093
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:06,790
I could never bring it before my people,

1094
00:35:06,791 --> 00:35:10,650
I can never endorse it because my people
are the agricultural people and those

1095
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:11,770
people that keep me in office.

1096
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,170
So I'm going to just tell you right now,

1097
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:14,651
well,

1098
00:35:14,651 --> 00:35:18,400
we're just gonna create a bunch of
red tape and it'll never get passed.

1099
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:20,500
And even though it's
logical and it makes sense,

1100
00:35:20,501 --> 00:35:21,334
I'll never support it.

1101
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,061
And he was like,

1102
00:35:22,061 --> 00:35:22,930
what the fuck?

1103
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:24,063
Like this is,

1104
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:27,070
this is what's wrong with
politics and this is what's wrong.

1105
00:35:27,071 --> 00:35:30,700
When you're dealing with people that
are not really the representation,

1106
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,830
they're not really
representatives of people.

1107
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,170
They're representatives of
whoever got him in office.

1108
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:35,570
They,

1109
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:38,160
they can pretend to be the of the people.

1110
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:40,680
Sort of like late night preachers,

1111
00:35:40,681 --> 00:35:42,750
pretend to be the servants of God.

1112
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:43,411
Really,

1113
00:35:43,411 --> 00:35:44,340
they're just making money.

1114
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:45,960
They're making money and they're,

1115
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:46,580
you know,

1116
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:48,570
supposed to give 10% yeah,

1117
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,920
well late night preachers,

1118
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:50,120
you,

1119
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:50,700
you don't even,

1120
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,470
they don't even want 10%
they want everything.

1121
00:35:52,471 --> 00:35:54,150
You got heavy here with a tough,

1122
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:59,360
one of the funniest things that they have
con people into doing is they figured

1123
00:35:59,581 --> 00:36:01,920
out a way to tell people like,

1124
00:36:01,921 --> 00:36:03,420
I know you don't have any money.

1125
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:04,403
I know,

1126
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:06,060
I know times it's tough,

1127
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:09,150
but what you have to understand is
you have to have faith in the Lord.

1128
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,040
Give everything you can.

1129
00:36:11,041 --> 00:36:15,690
The Lord will give you that back 10
fold like they tell you if you're broke.

1130
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:19,020
So they're going after people who are
desperate and broke and they had all

1131
00:36:19,021 --> 00:36:19,420
these,

1132
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:21,630
these people that would give these,

1133
00:36:21,631 --> 00:36:22,170
um,

1134
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:25,080
these speeches there would talk about
what happened to them and they were

1135
00:36:25,081 --> 00:36:25,381
saying,

1136
00:36:25,381 --> 00:36:25,681
well,

1137
00:36:25,681 --> 00:36:26,011
you know,

1138
00:36:26,011 --> 00:36:29,250
I was broke and I didn't have
any money and times are tough.

1139
00:36:29,251 --> 00:36:32,760
And I was wondering how it was going to
take my bills and how I was going to pay

1140
00:36:32,761 --> 00:36:33,391
for food,

1141
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:36,540
but I had this $100 and I was
going to use towards my rent.

1142
00:36:36,541 --> 00:36:37,010
But I said,

1143
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:37,650
you know what,

1144
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:39,320
I'm giving this $100 to God.

1145
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,800
Everybody starts cheering and clapping.

1146
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:42,210
And then from that,

1147
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:43,440
oh Lord,

1148
00:36:43,441 --> 00:36:47,490
I got a new job and I got a new
car and everything happened.

1149
00:36:47,491 --> 00:36:47,830
And,

1150
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:48,100
and,

1151
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:52,200
and people are clapping and cheering and
music starts playing and they build it

1152
00:36:52,201 --> 00:36:53,460
up and they're just like,

1153
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:54,450
making you come.

1154
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:54,750
They're like,

1155
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:57,270
oh they're like,

1156
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:02,220
it's like this stimulation thing that
they're doing and they're actively

1157
00:37:02,221 --> 00:37:05,910
targeting people so stupid that they
really can't do anything about it.

1158
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:07,170
Like these people,

1159
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:11,820
that's like the right people to rip off
cause these people are broke and the

1160
00:37:11,821 --> 00:37:14,910
reality is most people
who are severely broke,

1161
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,710
they're going to stay broke.

1162
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:18,330
The vast majority,

1163
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:18,961
whatever it is,

1164
00:37:18,961 --> 00:37:20,940
60 70 80% pick a number,

1165
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:22,320
they're going to stay broke.

1166
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:25,140
And so that's the ones that they go after.

1167
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,870
So it's nobody cares,

1168
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:28,860
nobody cares about them.

1169
00:37:28,861 --> 00:37:31,020
Like you get your rip certain people off,

1170
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:34,980
people get really frustrated and
angry and you rip other people off.

1171
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:37,860
Do you think in the future that's going,

1172
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:41,310
that's going to be not
as big of a problem?

1173
00:37:41,311 --> 00:37:43,860
Do you think religions
shrinking or growing?

1174
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:44,830
I think religion is

1175
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:46,740
probably overall shrinking,

1176
00:37:46,741 --> 00:37:50,400
but stupid people are
always going to exist.

1177
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:54,450
And so if you call it religion or if
you call it a cult or you call it,

1178
00:37:54,451 --> 00:37:54,901
I mean there's a,

1179
00:37:54,901 --> 00:37:59,610
there's a lot of organizations that don't
necessarily have some sort of a deity

1180
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:00,690
at the top of their,

1181
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:01,813
their structure.

1182
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,960
But there's still the same thing.

1183
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:06,840
It's one person who is,

1184
00:38:06,841 --> 00:38:08,400
or one group of people,

1185
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:10,500
whether it's Scientology or anything else,

1186
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:16,520
one group of people that is offering you
a solution for how to live your life.

1187
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:21,150
And they have all these guidelines that
they have set up and they want you to

1188
00:38:21,151 --> 00:38:22,440
contribute and they want your money,

1189
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:26,220
they want your money and they want
your time and they want you to donate.

1190
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:27,010
Like,

1191
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:28,350
did you see going clear?

1192
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:29,243
Have you seen that?

1193
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:31,260
How fucking scary was that?

1194
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:36,190
I think that any kind call like that is,

1195
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:36,640
or,

1196
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,473
uh,

1197
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:41,170
like I just saw a celebrity wife
swap and I know this sounds weird,

1198
00:38:41,171 --> 00:38:45,160
but Corey Feldman and Tommy Davidson
where the two people that switched,

1199
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:45,971
uh,

1200
00:38:45,971 --> 00:38:50,340
and they really showed you an inside
look of how Corey Feldman treats his,

1201
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:50,770
uh,

1202
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:53,080
Corey angels is what he calls him.

1203
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:57,580
He's trying to do kind of like a cross
between Hugh Hefner and Michael Jackson

1204
00:38:57,581 --> 00:38:58,450
or something like that.

1205
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:01,630
He pretty much has
brainwashed these girls,

1206
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:02,440
uh,

1207
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:02,831
to,

1208
00:39:02,831 --> 00:39:05,110
to fall anything he says.

1209
00:39:05,111 --> 00:39:09,100
And it includes like a contract
that they have to sign.

1210
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:10,060
Oh,

1211
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:10,181
well,

1212
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:13,240
you know that Corey was
an actor his whole life,

1213
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:13,481
right.

1214
00:39:13,481 --> 00:39:13,721
You know,

1215
00:39:13,721 --> 00:39:17,110
is probably a bullshit artist and it's
most likely that this is a hustle.

1216
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:19,090
Hustle may be,

1217
00:39:19,091 --> 00:39:20,590
but I know a girl,

1218
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:22,840
let me say this right,

1219
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:27,870
I know a girl that knows that girl and
that girl used to be one of his angels

1220
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:29,820
and uh,

1221
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:33,910
she left because it was too call like,

1222
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:35,500
and the things that you were,

1223
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:37,570
you had to do once a week,

1224
00:39:37,571 --> 00:39:40,930
they would have an orgy and then
that they would just do drugs,

1225
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:41,920
have an orgy,

1226
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:42,910
have people over.

1227
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:47,320
And then the days after that
orgy you would work out to yoga.

1228
00:39:47,321 --> 00:39:49,540
I eat healthy and uh,

1229
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:50,643
it's uh,

1230
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:51,190
she,

1231
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:56,190
she said to the her friend how it was
just like brainwashed girls looking for

1232
00:39:56,291 --> 00:39:58,690
their chance in Hollywood
and he would be like,

1233
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,171
oh no,

1234
00:39:59,171 --> 00:40:01,810
you join this and you follow my plan.

1235
00:40:01,811 --> 00:40:02,680
And anyways,

1236
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:05,930
the episode goes really into that and it,

1237
00:40:05,931 --> 00:40:06,380
it's,

1238
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:11,380
it's watching them talk and watching how
he reacts to the wife swap part of it.

1239
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,380
It's very interesting.

1240
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:15,011
It's a,

1241
00:40:15,011 --> 00:40:20,011
it almost seems to me that like whatever
had happened to in his past maybe with

1242
00:40:20,561 --> 00:40:22,660
Michael Jackson are his childhood,

1243
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:23,291
uh,

1244
00:40:23,291 --> 00:40:26,680
is really effecting him as
an adult because he's very,

1245
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:27,371
like,

1246
00:40:27,371 --> 00:40:28,900
he's not making any sense.

1247
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:29,171
Uh,

1248
00:40:29,171 --> 00:40:29,531
he's,

1249
00:40:29,531 --> 00:40:30,490
he's just like not a

1250
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:32,200
ton of drugs first of all.

1251
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:32,730
Right.

1252
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:33,340
And you know,

1253
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:38,340
I know a guy who was in like a
swap situation before and with,

1254
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:44,190
with a UN no need to name celebrity was
the same kind of thing where this guy

1255
00:40:44,681 --> 00:40:48,790
like let his wife fuck other people
and then we're all together and uh,

1256
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:49,361
he,

1257
00:40:49,361 --> 00:40:49,930
you know,

1258
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:52,130
he came out of it and one of the things
that he said to me when he came out of

1259
00:40:52,131 --> 00:40:52,890
it was like,

1260
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:53,320
uh,

1261
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:53,531
you know,

1262
00:40:53,531 --> 00:40:54,161
he told me the story.

1263
00:40:54,161 --> 00:40:54,460
He was like,

1264
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:55,180
listen man,

1265
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,050
they're all fucked up.

1266
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,930
Anybody that's involved in that
kind of situation is fucked up.

1267
00:40:58,990 --> 00:40:59,920
Like they're all crazy.

1268
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:01,300
Like that's part of what it is.

1269
00:41:01,301 --> 00:41:04,210
But if you're in Hollywood
and you're in like that,

1270
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:06,130
like want to be showbiz circle,

1271
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:07,810
just plenty of fucked up people,

1272
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:09,310
you could find plenty of people.

1273
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:11,830
And if you can come up with
some sort of a name for it,

1274
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:14,920
Cory's angels or whatever
the hell he calls it,

1275
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:15,790
Eh,

1276
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:16,600
you could do it.

1277
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:16,811
Yeah.

1278
00:41:16,811 --> 00:41:17,030
Well,

1279
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:21,070
I mean l Ron Hubbard was a
fucking moron and he was a moron.

1280
00:41:21,071 --> 00:41:21,221
And uh,

1281
00:41:21,221 --> 00:41:21,550
his,

1282
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:22,383
his,

1283
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:22,841
his,

1284
00:41:22,841 --> 00:41:23,050
uh,

1285
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:24,220
books were terrible.

1286
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:24,670
They were,

1287
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:25,503
they were terrible.

1288
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:26,321
And if you like,

1289
00:41:26,321 --> 00:41:27,490
listen to him talk,

1290
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:30,010
he was not a charming guy.

1291
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:31,660
He was not articulate.

1292
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:32,920
He wasn't brilliant.

1293
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,420
He wasn't this guy that had this point,

1294
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,520
like even like David Koresh,

1295
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:38,930
although he's a dip shit,

1296
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:43,400
he played stupid songs or that the fucking
idiot in Australia that claims he's

1297
00:41:43,401 --> 00:41:44,120
Jesus,

1298
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:48,740
they have a certain amount of
confidence and smoothness to them.

1299
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:50,480
L Ron Hubbard didn't have any of that.

1300
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:51,590
And meanwhile,

1301
00:41:51,591 --> 00:41:53,900
Scientology became a
gigantic organization.

1302
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,310
I think for a lot of people,

1303
00:41:56,330 --> 00:41:57,340
the structure,

1304
00:41:57,350 --> 00:42:00,440
any sort of structure is comforting
and they're looking for something.

1305
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:01,520
So like,

1306
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:01,880
you know,

1307
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,230
get back to the original point,

1308
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:05,000
is religion going away?

1309
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:10,070
There's going to have to be something
big that happens to human beings for

1310
00:42:10,071 --> 00:42:11,180
religion to go away.

1311
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:13,280
And I wonder if that big thing,

1312
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:14,840
what would have to,

1313
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:16,190
it would have to be,

1314
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:20,780
people would have to be able to clearly
see what you know and what you don't

1315
00:42:20,781 --> 00:42:21,290
know.

1316
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:25,490
It would have to be a fundamental change
in how we communicate because like when

1317
00:42:25,491 --> 00:42:26,301
someone tells you,

1318
00:42:26,301 --> 00:42:31,301
I know that if you give that $100 to
know load will pay you back 10 fold.

1319
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:33,770
Have you say that to someone who's stupid?

1320
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:34,820
Like okay,

1321
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:37,220
he knows he knows a little pay me back.

1322
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:41,390
I got to give that money and the Lord
was going to pay me back 10 fold.

1323
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:41,960
You know,

1324
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:42,950
you really believe it.

1325
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:44,090
But if you could see that,

1326
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,260
oh he doesn't really know that.

1327
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:48,320
If there was like a light bulb that
went over a person's head when they were

1328
00:42:48,321 --> 00:42:52,280
telling the truth or you could look in
their eyes and you could see the numbers,

1329
00:42:52,290 --> 00:42:53,123
like there's excellent,

1330
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:53,571
you know,

1331
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:55,340
like a Turkey tester you ever,

1332
00:42:55,341 --> 00:42:55,640
you know,

1333
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:55,911
gobble,

1334
00:42:55,911 --> 00:42:56,121
gobble,

1335
00:42:56,121 --> 00:42:56,900
gobble.

1336
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:57,531
You ever see those,

1337
00:42:57,531 --> 00:42:57,790
uh,

1338
00:42:57,790 --> 00:42:58,380
what's your gates?

1339
00:42:58,380 --> 00:42:58,551
Yeah,

1340
00:42:58,551 --> 00:42:59,790
those things that put the lights out,

1341
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:00,873
use those anymore.

1342
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:01,041
Yeah.

1343
00:43:01,041 --> 00:43:03,200
You probably like leak fucking chemicals.

1344
00:43:03,201 --> 00:43:06,230
Probably not supposed to have plastic
inside a Turkey that you're cooking,

1345
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:09,050
but like something along those lines,

1346
00:43:09,051 --> 00:43:13,010
like a temperature gauge or a number or
something where you could see whether or

1347
00:43:13,011 --> 00:43:14,210
not someone's being honest,

1348
00:43:14,211 --> 00:43:16,730
where they really know what they're
saying or whether or not they're

1349
00:43:16,731 --> 00:43:17,564
bullshitting.

1350
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:19,063
Yeah.

1351
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:19,660
Well,

1352
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:20,810
what's interesting about this,

1353
00:43:20,811 --> 00:43:21,580
Corey Feldman,

1354
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:22,560
they stuck on that sheet.

1355
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,230
If you watch it,

1356
00:43:24,231 --> 00:43:25,040
you'll be no,

1357
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,660
I mean I went frantic on it.

1358
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:27,021
Kind of go.

1359
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:28,610
I'm not going to watch and
we watch a little clip.

1360
00:43:28,611 --> 00:43:28,791
I do.

1361
00:43:28,791 --> 00:43:29,960
Is Him introducing you,

1362
00:43:29,961 --> 00:43:33,770
his angels kicked off of Youtube for your
fucking Corey Feldman week session or

1363
00:43:33,771 --> 00:43:34,480
would we

1364
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,020
probably,

1365
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:35,321
probably,

1366
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:35,620
yeah.

1367
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:36,610
Well we can watch it over there.

1368
00:43:36,611 --> 00:43:36,880
Right?

1369
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,560
Can we watch over there
and not really watch it?

1370
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:40,121
We can watch it,

1371
00:43:40,121 --> 00:43:40,954
but we can't.

1372
00:43:41,710 --> 00:43:43,390
Can we play volume?

1373
00:43:43,810 --> 00:43:44,643
Maybe.

1374
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:45,340
Maybe.

1375
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:45,521
All right.

1376
00:43:45,521 --> 00:43:46,354
We'll see what happens.

1377
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:48,580
Jamie's kept good editing skills.

1378
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:49,111
All right.

1379
00:43:49,111 --> 00:43:51,310
Play that bitch over
here and freaked me out.

1380
00:43:51,490 --> 00:43:52,323
Go ahead.

1381
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,500
In our relationships.

1382
00:43:55,501 --> 00:43:57,170
So these are the girls is not,

1383
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:59,220
it is down here.

1384
00:43:59,260 --> 00:43:59,511
I was like,

1385
00:43:59,511 --> 00:43:59,531
oh,

1386
00:43:59,531 --> 00:44:00,364
that girl's hot.

1387
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:01,443
How's it getting that?

1388
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:02,763
Um,

1389
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:03,820
but uh,

1390
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:04,690
it's the one right here.

1391
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:08,560
Meet Corey Feldman and his angels,

1392
00:44:08,561 --> 00:44:10,270
the former child actor scroll down,

1393
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:14,920
lives in eccentric and avant
garde lifestyle with his angels.

1394
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,320
What avant garde,

1395
00:44:17,350 --> 00:44:18,430
what is avant garde mean?

1396
00:44:18,810 --> 00:44:18,901
Oh,

1397
00:44:18,901 --> 00:44:19,310
look at him.

1398
00:44:19,310 --> 00:44:20,143
I'm Corey Feldman.

1399
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:25,380
You probably know me from lost boys
getting e's stand by me and only

1400
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:31,400
started acting and singing simultaneously.

1401
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:32,040
I've been

1402
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,680
in singer and musician
for several decades now.

1403
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:38,070
I am a bit eccentric a bit Ivan Guard,

1404
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:40,140
but if I was just like everybody else,

1405
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:41,910
I wouldn't be on your TV sets.

1406
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:45,323
Ooh.

1407
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:50,810
I have a lot of women with their careers
and Hollywood and then I would realize

1408
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:52,950
they went off to be successful.

1409
00:44:53,010 --> 00:44:54,360
And what did I get out of it?

1410
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:55,283
Not much.

1411
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:58,110
That's why I developed my company.

1412
00:44:58,111 --> 00:44:59,010
Cory's angels.

1413
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:04,190
Cory's angels is a management production
and development business comprised of

1414
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:05,034
beautiful,

1415
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:05,881
talented,

1416
00:45:05,881 --> 00:45:10,881
we girls sign a contract with
us so when they do succeed,

1417
00:45:11,310 --> 00:45:13,950
I can get rewards as well for
the work that I put it to that

1418
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:17,790
when the girls become angels,

1419
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:19,110
they move into my house.

1420
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,310
I see why you're obsessed.

1421
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:23,820
You frankly,

1422
00:45:23,910 --> 00:45:27,690
drag van trust model and
I'm one of course angels.

1423
00:45:27,710 --> 00:45:30,150
I am Caitlin and I am an aspiring actress,

1424
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:33,150
professional model and
Cory's angel and training.

1425
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:34,313
I'm Courtney.

1426
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:37,070
I'm a Dj and I'm Cory's manger.

1427
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:37,330
Oh,

1428
00:45:37,330 --> 00:45:37,660
I,

1429
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:38,790
Oh hell out.

1430
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:39,870
Also,

1431
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:41,040
I'm his girlfriend.

1432
00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:43,680
Cory has changed my life in so many ways.

1433
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:47,400
He uses in his own connections
to help me be successful.

1434
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:50,310
He's sexy and gorgeous and I love him.

1435
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:58,830
Is this the polyamorous as far as
what happens behind closed doors?

1436
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:00,060
It stays behind closed doors.

1437
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:01,193
Exactly.

1438
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:07,260
We have a very kind of strict regimens.

1439
00:46:07,261 --> 00:46:08,094
Goal number one,

1440
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:09,990
we will put them on the Angel Diet.

1441
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:12,660
That means no meat of any kind.

1442
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:13,890
I'm a fruitarian,

1443
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,050
which means that I only eat fruit.

1444
00:46:16,350 --> 00:46:17,190
Number two,

1445
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,650
exercise like,

1446
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:20,301
go ahead you guys.

1447
00:46:20,301 --> 00:46:20,910
Hot.

1448
00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:21,750
Number three,

1449
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:25,650
we don't allow men on the property
unless they're inviting guests.

1450
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:27,813
That's how you do it.

1451
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:32,670
This lifestyle is not for the
close minded or faint of heart.

1452
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:35,310
I strive every day to do God's will.

1453
00:46:35,550 --> 00:46:36,390
Yay.

1454
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:39,490
So he makes these girls
wear these slutty outfits.

1455
00:46:39,491 --> 00:46:39,850
They're not.

1456
00:46:39,850 --> 00:46:41,960
They have to wear like
these broad and lingerie's.

1457
00:46:41,961 --> 00:46:43,030
They're not allowed to work close.

1458
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:43,530
Hold up.

1459
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:44,620
This is on ABC?

1460
00:46:44,650 --> 00:46:45,483
Yeah,

1461
00:46:45,850 --> 00:46:48,310
he's on the ABC's going Desperado.

1462
00:46:48,311 --> 00:46:48,760
Huh?

1463
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:51,790
Well I tell you desperate as fuck
through written network TV is desperate.

1464
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:52,653
Yeah.

1465
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:57,520
And I was really sad is
that Tommy Davidson was the
guy that they swapped with

1466
00:46:57,580 --> 00:46:58,240
and his,

1467
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:03,100
he has like a nice family kids and
so they brought the angel over,

1468
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:03,880
uh,

1469
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:08,290
to his house and the angel's like getting
like Bachelor parties and naked people

1470
00:47:08,291 --> 00:47:10,810
in his house went in front
of it's kids and okay.

1471
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:11,703
Okay.

1472
00:47:11,770 --> 00:47:13,450
You know that they arrange that.

1473
00:47:13,451 --> 00:47:14,830
The producers arranged that.

1474
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:16,090
He seemed pretty pissed off.

1475
00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:17,170
He just left the house.

1476
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:18,430
What the fuck course.

1477
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:19,430
And of course he did.

1478
00:47:19,430 --> 00:47:19,691
Oh yeah.

1479
00:47:19,691 --> 00:47:20,760
I'm sure there's a sea salt.

1480
00:47:20,950 --> 00:47:22,330
This is all 100% fake.

1481
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:23,590
Hundred percent arranged.

1482
00:47:23,830 --> 00:47:24,970
This is all planned out.

1483
00:47:25,150 --> 00:47:29,740
Cory has a fucking one piece of hair waxed
that hangs strategically front of his

1484
00:47:29,741 --> 00:47:30,520
face.

1485
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:31,060
Yeah.

1486
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:32,170
I mean this is a scam.

1487
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:32,951
What this is,

1488
00:47:32,951 --> 00:47:37,810
is Cory's shot at getting back on TV and
what he's doing is getting those girls

1489
00:47:37,811 --> 00:47:39,460
with him and it's working.

1490
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:40,810
It's getting them exposure.

1491
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:41,950
They're getting on TV.

1492
00:47:41,951 --> 00:47:45,250
So his plan is to be this guy who's the,

1493
00:47:45,251 --> 00:47:45,651
the,

1494
00:47:45,651 --> 00:47:46,750
the ringleader.

1495
00:47:46,751 --> 00:47:47,620
I'm Cory.

1496
00:47:47,621 --> 00:47:48,790
These are Cory's angels.

1497
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:50,820
This is the hustle we're
going to get on ABC.

1498
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:52,060
And he's getting it for them.

1499
00:47:52,270 --> 00:47:53,980
But whether or not this is all real,

1500
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:57,300
he's been doing the angel thing for a
long time course cause it says this is

1501
00:47:57,310 --> 00:47:57,970
hustle.

1502
00:47:57,970 --> 00:47:59,140
This is how he's getting,

1503
00:47:59,170 --> 00:48:00,660
it's like a pyramid scam forum.

1504
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:02,290
Sort of.

1505
00:48:02,290 --> 00:48:04,690
I mean this is his intertainment shtick.

1506
00:48:04,810 --> 00:48:08,170
This is how he's getting
some form of attention.

1507
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:08,891
He,

1508
00:48:08,891 --> 00:48:09,071
uh,

1509
00:48:09,071 --> 00:48:10,810
when these girls leave the angels,

1510
00:48:10,811 --> 00:48:12,380
he has contracts that hit the,

1511
00:48:12,410 --> 00:48:15,970
he gets a percentage of
everything they make from that on.

1512
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:16,630
Good.

1513
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:17,170
Good luck.

1514
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:19,750
You're going to get 50 bucks from
the chick who works at Guitar.

1515
00:48:19,751 --> 00:48:20,584
Now

1516
00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:23,290
what is he gonna make?

1517
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:25,330
I mean if they do get big,

1518
00:48:25,331 --> 00:48:26,560
they'll have him killed.

1519
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:28,990
Do you know if one of
those girls gets huge?

1520
00:48:28,991 --> 00:48:29,471
She gets it,

1521
00:48:29,471 --> 00:48:31,630
becomes the next Rihanna
or whoever the fuck she is.

1522
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:32,920
Who are you still have that car killed?

1523
00:48:32,921 --> 00:48:33,790
Please watch it though.

1524
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:34,624
It's on Hulu.

1525
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:35,130
It's,

1526
00:48:35,130 --> 00:48:36,670
it just takes smoke a joint,

1527
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:40,180
cut the breaks of his VW bug and
push him off a fucking cliff.

1528
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:42,130
He's announce hall.

1529
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:43,860
Do you have that video of him at,

1530
00:48:43,861 --> 00:48:45,010
at the baseball game?

1531
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:46,780
He took his band.

1532
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:47,710
You're obsessed.

1533
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:48,460
This,

1534
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:49,330
this is crazy.

1535
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:50,050
He took,

1536
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:55,050
he took his band and he opened up or he
played at a minor league baseball game

1537
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:58,840
and uh,

1538
00:48:58,930 --> 00:49:00,850
he just watch it.

1539
00:49:00,890 --> 00:49:02,500
It's pretty ridiculous.

1540
00:49:02,501 --> 00:49:04,100
You are fucking absurd.

1541
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:04,750
So chip,

1542
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:05,471
here's this band.

1543
00:49:05,471 --> 00:49:06,070
By the way,

1544
00:49:06,070 --> 00:49:08,670
none of these instruments I,

1545
00:49:08,830 --> 00:49:10,770
somebody told me none of these
instruments are actually,

1546
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,050
they're not actually playing.

1547
00:49:12,051 --> 00:49:14,150
These instruments are not what you think.

1548
00:49:14,151 --> 00:49:15,710
They should be real about that.

1549
00:49:15,830 --> 00:49:15,981
Well,

1550
00:49:15,981 --> 00:49:17,390
they're authentic with their art.

1551
00:49:18,270 --> 00:49:19,103
Okay.

1552
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:21,760
He's still doing the
Michael Jackson thing.

1553
00:49:21,970 --> 00:49:25,000
That's why he has his hair
like that state college spikes.

1554
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:25,863
What does that mean?

1555
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:27,543
Uh,

1556
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:27,941
yeah,

1557
00:49:27,941 --> 00:49:28,870
I think a minor league baseball.

1558
00:49:31,730 --> 00:49:32,563
Okay.

1559
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:35,200
People don't know what to do.

1560
00:49:35,201 --> 00:49:36,034
Look up.

1561
00:49:36,230 --> 00:49:39,910
There's only like 20 people in the
audience and they're looking at this like

1562
00:49:39,911 --> 00:49:43,630
it's a do that one white guy
bouncing around even stopped.

1563
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:46,120
He bounced for a little and people like,

1564
00:49:46,121 --> 00:49:46,720
what are you doing?

1565
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:47,111
Oh yeah,

1566
00:49:47,111 --> 00:49:47,560
you're right.

1567
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:48,430
What am I doing?

1568
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,080
Look at this guy with his camera.

1569
00:49:50,110 --> 00:49:50,640
I'm more wrong.

1570
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:51,473
My Kid,

1571
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:53,650
the guy on stage bottom right.

1572
00:49:53,651 --> 00:49:57,500
Just a little laughing his ass
off at how ridiculous a shit was.

1573
00:49:57,501 --> 00:50:00,400
Looking at him with his
fucking shiny pants.

1574
00:50:01,010 --> 00:50:02,830
That guy is so bizarre.

1575
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,060
I look at the girls,

1576
00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:06,251
but listen man,

1577
00:50:06,251 --> 00:50:07,690
if you're that guy and you,

1578
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:08,131
you,

1579
00:50:08,131 --> 00:50:12,370
you have to be the guy that like lets
these girls fuck other guys because

1580
00:50:12,371 --> 00:50:13,041
otherwise they're going to,

1581
00:50:13,041 --> 00:50:14,230
but they're going to get bored with you.

1582
00:50:14,231 --> 00:50:16,360
You wait 15 pounds and
you're a fucking freak.

1583
00:50:16,361 --> 00:50:17,680
He doesn't like guys into his.

1584
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:18,520
Of course he does,

1585
00:50:18,521 --> 00:50:19,354
Dude.

1586
00:50:19,710 --> 00:50:21,640
He also holds and they
might not go into his house,

1587
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:22,840
but they have orgies.

1588
00:50:22,870 --> 00:50:24,340
They don't just have origins with him.

1589
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:25,451
Okay.

1590
00:50:25,451 --> 00:50:26,800
Other dudes are given those girls,

1591
00:50:26,801 --> 00:50:28,750
Dick Guaranteed caucus

1592
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:31,583
that

1593
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:33,533
Jesus,

1594
00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:34,811
that guy's like,

1595
00:50:34,811 --> 00:50:35,780
what the fuck the girl is like,

1596
00:50:35,781 --> 00:50:35,991
get,

1597
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:36,471
get the hat,

1598
00:50:36,471 --> 00:50:37,304
get that.

1599
00:50:38,390 --> 00:50:39,660
Toss it back to me in a second.

1600
00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:46,723
Oh my God.

1601
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:48,800
What is this song?

1602
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:50,463
It's this.

1603
00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:52,370
He's trying to be Michael Jackson.

1604
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:52,911
Well.

1605
00:50:52,911 --> 00:50:55,130
He's like a combination
of Michael Jackson,

1606
00:50:55,150 --> 00:50:55,983
Charlie,

1607
00:50:56,030 --> 00:50:56,863
Charlie Sheen,

1608
00:50:57,140 --> 00:50:58,110
Eddie vetter.

1609
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:01,790
He's really weirdly Pale too.

1610
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:04,060
Oh here you guys saw my daddy freelancing.

1611
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,000
It's breaking it down.

1612
00:51:08,810 --> 00:51:10,840
He can't make eye contact
with people because they're,

1613
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:12,890
they're all like looking
at him like he's a freak.

1614
00:51:13,450 --> 00:51:16,460
So like he's doing all this crazy
dancing and they're not reacting.

1615
00:51:16,790 --> 00:51:19,910
It's very strange and
he doesn't look at them.

1616
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:23,870
He's sort of like looking
like at like their knee area.

1617
00:51:24,650 --> 00:51:25,483
You know what I mean?

1618
00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:29,950
He did the Michael Jackson
thing with the dancer too.

1619
00:51:29,951 --> 00:51:30,784
Is that again,

1620
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:32,660
I would steal that fucking hat.

1621
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,160
I would steal that fucking man.

1622
00:51:34,850 --> 00:51:35,600
It's on the ground.

1623
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:37,460
Why isn't anybody going for pussies?

1624
00:51:37,490 --> 00:51:38,323
Someone go,

1625
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:39,253
you had a chance.

1626
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:43,790
We'll get tangled up in some
chords and the a lot of rescue him.

1627
00:51:43,970 --> 00:51:44,780
He's tangled.

1628
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:45,613
He's fucking tangled.

1629
00:51:46,410 --> 00:51:46,800
Look out,

1630
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:47,740
look out a little stages.

1631
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:50,510
There's cords everywhere cause you're
like a hot air balloon holding those

1632
00:51:50,511 --> 00:51:53,540
courts up wise their cars because of
course they go straight up into the sky.

1633
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:54,700
Wait,

1634
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:56,330
we didn't just stay in one place.

1635
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:59,780
Here's the plan that he got set up
on this whole event that set up.

1636
00:51:59,810 --> 00:52:00,021
Yeah.

1637
00:52:00,021 --> 00:52:01,070
That's someone fucked him.

1638
00:52:01,250 --> 00:52:03,470
That's why he wants that so bad.

1639
00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:05,240
How could someone set him up?

1640
00:52:05,241 --> 00:52:05,521
He's,

1641
00:52:05,521 --> 00:52:06,354
he's dancing.

1642
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:07,881
They're singing.

1643
00:52:07,881 --> 00:52:08,750
There's no one there.

1644
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:10,550
It was after baseball game.

1645
00:52:10,551 --> 00:52:11,780
It was unprofessional and,

1646
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:12,651
Oh Yada,

1647
00:52:12,651 --> 00:52:13,484
Yada.

1648
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:14,840
Oh my God.

1649
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:15,380
He's,

1650
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:17,770
he lost his Special Olympics game gate

1651
00:52:17,850 --> 00:52:19,620
gig because of this video.

1652
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:21,030
What?

1653
00:52:21,030 --> 00:52:22,110
He was supposed to play the spa,

1654
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:23,940
a special Olympics come gig.

1655
00:52:23,970 --> 00:52:25,410
And he lost it after this video.

1656
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:25,970
So no,

1657
00:52:25,970 --> 00:52:27,030
and he's upset about it.

1658
00:52:27,031 --> 00:52:27,930
The Special Olympics.

1659
00:52:27,950 --> 00:52:28,231
Yeah.

1660
00:52:28,231 --> 00:52:29,910
Imagine if he got booed
by retarded people,

1661
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:31,590
but is his shit,

1662
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:34,620
I shouldn't say retarded
because they don't have,

1663
00:52:34,830 --> 00:52:35,910
they have down's syndrome.

1664
00:52:35,911 --> 00:52:37,410
Trans started there.

1665
00:52:37,470 --> 00:52:38,580
There's something wrong with them.

1666
00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:40,680
Retarded is not a real word.

1667
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:44,970
That's why I resent the fact that you're
not supposed to use retarded for people

1668
00:52:44,971 --> 00:52:45,804
that are idiots.

1669
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:48,690
And then I went and used it for
people that have legitimate issues.

1670
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:49,891
That's,

1671
00:52:49,891 --> 00:52:50,280
uh,

1672
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:50,850
he's,

1673
00:52:50,850 --> 00:52:51,750
he might be regarded.

1674
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:54,510
There's something wrong.

1675
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:56,040
There's something definitely wrong,

1676
00:52:56,160 --> 00:53:00,300
but it's also like there's that thing
that happens when you become like a Gary

1677
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:01,410
Coleman or like someone who's a,

1678
00:53:01,411 --> 00:53:02,310
a personal,

1679
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:05,550
you're a punchline and you're
kind of on the outside like that.

1680
00:53:05,730 --> 00:53:07,560
When they get real freaky,

1681
00:53:07,770 --> 00:53:12,770
they get like they get desperado and it
all becomes one attempt after the next

1682
00:53:12,991 --> 00:53:14,010
to try to get attention.

1683
00:53:14,430 --> 00:53:14,611
You know,

1684
00:53:14,611 --> 00:53:17,160
you see it a lot from
reality stars that like they,

1685
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:22,110
they're there 15 minutes and then they
start scrambling to try to like do new

1686
00:53:22,111 --> 00:53:23,100
stents and new,

1687
00:53:23,101 --> 00:53:24,000
different things.

1688
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:27,990
Do you remember kid was
under the real world?

1689
00:53:28,110 --> 00:53:28,840
His name is

1690
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:29,560
puck.

1691
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:30,393
Yeah.

1692
00:53:30,430 --> 00:53:30,830
Dead.

1693
00:53:30,830 --> 00:53:31,120
No,

1694
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:33,580
I saw them on a sunset like uh,

1695
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:35,110
maybe a year ago.

1696
00:53:35,111 --> 00:53:35,944
I saw him on Sunday.

1697
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:37,540
How does a guy like that feed himself?

1698
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:38,950
Uh,

1699
00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:39,610
how does that work?

1700
00:53:39,610 --> 00:53:40,660
You didn't look like he wasn't,

1701
00:53:41,490 --> 00:53:44,470
but what does a guy like that
do for a Gig for a while?

1702
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:45,250
I bet he made money.

1703
00:53:45,250 --> 00:53:45,640
I mean this,

1704
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:47,110
he was around 20 years ago though,

1705
00:53:47,111 --> 00:53:51,100
but you probably made money as a peer
on appearances for like 10 years just

1706
00:53:51,101 --> 00:53:51,551
being puck.

1707
00:53:51,551 --> 00:53:52,384
We still know his name,

1708
00:53:54,010 --> 00:53:55,360
pulled it out of the back of my ass.

1709
00:53:55,630 --> 00:53:59,660
But the reason why I know it is because
he was that guy that was like always

1710
00:53:59,710 --> 00:54:04,450
doing exaggerated things and always being
ridiculous to try and get attention.

1711
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:07,480
But there's a lot of those fucking people,

1712
00:54:07,481 --> 00:54:07,781
man.

1713
00:54:07,781 --> 00:54:08,330
I mean that's,

1714
00:54:08,330 --> 00:54:08,720
that's,

1715
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:12,660
that's like what the reality
show world sort of creates,

1716
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:13,640
reduces,

1717
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:16,670
it looks like puck was
in prisons now an ex con,

1718
00:54:17,150 --> 00:54:21,140
he's now living as a makeup artist
who sounds like he hates women.

1719
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:24,860
He says he was with Oj
in prison for two years.

1720
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:26,990
He was with Oj.

1721
00:54:27,590 --> 00:54:28,100
Wow.

1722
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:29,450
He was in for stalking.

1723
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:30,770
Oh my God.

1724
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:32,270
Oh Jesus Christ.

1725
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:36,340
He was in fucking jail for stalking.

1726
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:37,353
Yeah.

1727
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:38,293
Wow.

1728
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:40,843
Hmm.

1729
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:42,073
Okay.

1730
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:42,973
Poor bastard.

1731
00:54:43,490 --> 00:54:44,121
But you know what I mean?

1732
00:54:44,121 --> 00:54:47,360
That's my point is that these
people that become like a punchline,

1733
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:48,433
they get to that.

1734
00:54:48,590 --> 00:54:51,950
And also the other thing is
being a guy like Corey Feldman,

1735
00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:53,361
I don't know.

1736
00:54:53,361 --> 00:54:54,800
I'm sure he's a fine fellow.

1737
00:54:54,830 --> 00:54:55,460
Never met him.

1738
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:56,293
Never met him.

1739
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:56,691
Sure.

1740
00:54:56,691 --> 00:54:57,524
He's a fine fellow.

1741
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:57,891
I don't know.

1742
00:54:57,891 --> 00:54:59,270
It doesn't seem like a mean person.

1743
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:00,380
It's not a hateful person.

1744
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:04,040
This is where I think it's fucked.

1745
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:08,600
That guy became famous when he was a
little kid and I think when you become

1746
00:55:08,601 --> 00:55:09,710
famous in your little kid,

1747
00:55:10,010 --> 00:55:13,760
your odds of developing as an adult,

1748
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,730
like a guy that we can
hang out with and talk to.

1749
00:55:16,731 --> 00:55:18,410
Just a normal balanced person,

1750
00:55:18,830 --> 00:55:20,660
they're almost fucking none.

1751
00:55:21,230 --> 00:55:25,820
I've only met a couple of people that
I know were famous when they were young

1752
00:55:25,821 --> 00:55:27,130
that I can hang out with and talk to her.

1753
00:55:27,131 --> 00:55:28,040
Like Ricky Schroder,

1754
00:55:28,250 --> 00:55:29,083
he's one of them.

1755
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:29,320
Rick,

1756
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:34,220
he's pretty goddamn normal for someone
who has grown up like in the public eye,

1757
00:55:34,221 --> 00:55:38,810
but he has been kind of out of the
public eye for a long time and he's got a

1758
00:55:38,811 --> 00:55:39,151
family.

1759
00:55:39,151 --> 00:55:40,880
He's very close to his family.

1760
00:55:40,881 --> 00:55:42,200
He's got a lot of interests.

1761
00:55:42,201 --> 00:55:43,730
He makes documentaries,

1762
00:55:43,731 --> 00:55:44,564
he hunts,

1763
00:55:44,750 --> 00:55:46,700
he like Ricky's a different sort of cat.

1764
00:55:47,390 --> 00:55:51,560
So he's like one of the few that like
was famous when he was young that I could

1765
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:52,340
hang out with.

1766
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:52,780
No problem.

1767
00:55:52,780 --> 00:55:52,871
Yeah,

1768
00:55:52,871 --> 00:55:53,290
it wouldn't.

1769
00:55:53,290 --> 00:55:56,860
When you went to ask her if that maybe
with like famous when young and still

1770
00:55:56,861 --> 00:56:00,100
trying to be famous the whole time
cause you just want to get out and they,

1771
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:03,700
they make it or they get out for a
long time and they can come back.

1772
00:56:04,090 --> 00:56:04,923
That's a good point.

1773
00:56:04,930 --> 00:56:05,651
That's a very good point.

1774
00:56:05,651 --> 00:56:09,820
Like Jodie foster was
famous when she was young.

1775
00:56:09,970 --> 00:56:14,080
She was in taxi driver and she's famous
now and she seems pretty fucking fun.

1776
00:56:14,110 --> 00:56:14,943
It seems fun.

1777
00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:15,761
What do you got there?

1778
00:56:15,761 --> 00:56:16,391
Brian Moore.

1779
00:56:16,391 --> 00:56:17,051
Corey Feldman.

1780
00:56:17,051 --> 00:56:19,530
Your fucking coy Feldman.

1781
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:19,960
Uh,

1782
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:24,130
two years ago Corey Feldman told
cops he was molested and his abusers,

1783
00:56:24,131 --> 00:56:26,980
but they did nothing because they were
too focused on the Michael Jackson

1784
00:56:26,981 --> 00:56:27,671
investigation,

1785
00:56:27,671 --> 00:56:30,180
which seems suspect right
there that he telling him,

1786
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:33,700
meaning they were abused by
someone other than Michael Johnson,

1787
00:56:34,030 --> 00:56:35,650
which he said that he writes,

1788
00:56:35,651 --> 00:56:38,740
the relationship with Jackson was the
healthiest in his life and that he never

1789
00:56:38,741 --> 00:56:39,580
abused in which,

1790
00:56:39,790 --> 00:56:40,300
you know,

1791
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:41,020
whatever.

1792
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:45,520
But he said he was molested and he told
the cops who molested him and they did

1793
00:56:45,521 --> 00:56:46,150
nothing.

1794
00:56:46,150 --> 00:56:46,331
Well,

1795
00:56:46,331 --> 00:56:47,320
why would he say that?

1796
00:56:47,321 --> 00:56:48,880
And not just say who molested.

1797
00:56:48,910 --> 00:56:49,660
Exactly.

1798
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:51,310
And then he spiraled into drug abuse.

1799
00:56:51,311 --> 00:56:54,620
Having regular coke off challenges
with friends and doing heroin.

1800
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:56,650
You ever been in a coke off at coke off?

1801
00:56:56,890 --> 00:56:57,723
No.

1802
00:56:58,390 --> 00:56:59,290
Do you think you could win?

1803
00:56:59,530 --> 00:57:00,840
Know how?

1804
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:02,080
What's your tolerance like?

1805
00:57:02,170 --> 00:57:02,420
Eh,

1806
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:06,700
I'm not into like I know people that can
just sit there and do coke all day long

1807
00:57:06,701 --> 00:57:07,810
and just whatever.

1808
00:57:07,811 --> 00:57:09,190
I'll have like one line and be like,

1809
00:57:09,191 --> 00:57:09,970
okay I'm good.

1810
00:57:09,970 --> 00:57:11,230
I've got to calm down
now I've got to come.

1811
00:57:11,270 --> 00:57:12,100
You know,

1812
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:13,240
cause he's drink so much coffee.

1813
00:57:13,350 --> 00:57:13,960
Yeah,

1814
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:14,550
exactly.

1815
00:57:14,550 --> 00:57:14,921
Go there.

1816
00:57:14,921 --> 00:57:15,840
Already elevated.

1817
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:19,210
Right now a Trenta has
gotta be unhealthy for you.

1818
00:57:19,211 --> 00:57:20,110
Two shots in there.

1819
00:57:20,290 --> 00:57:21,990
Two shots.

1820
00:57:22,010 --> 00:57:24,880
You know what's worse is
getting a Trenta of cold brew,

1821
00:57:25,030 --> 00:57:28,630
which is 10 times more
powerful than a regular coffee.

1822
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:29,050
What's not,

1823
00:57:29,050 --> 00:57:29,883
not more,

1824
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:33,880
but it is more powerful that
Starbucks says it's 10 times.

1825
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:34,870
Yeah,

1826
00:57:34,870 --> 00:57:35,650
we should look at that.

1827
00:57:35,650 --> 00:57:36,910
What is the new cold brew?

1828
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:42,520
It was really 10 times more powerful than
regular coffee that literally would be

1829
00:57:42,521 --> 00:57:43,120
like that.

1830
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:45,340
Have you ever seen that
caffeine powder that they sell?

1831
00:57:45,610 --> 00:57:46,060
Yeah.

1832
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:49,810
Kids have taken like tablespoons of
caffeine powder and died like it does.

1833
00:57:49,811 --> 00:57:51,730
It has absolutely killed people.

1834
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:56,020
And I would think that if cold brew was
really 10 times stronger than a regular

1835
00:57:56,021 --> 00:57:58,990
coffee because we have
those La nitrile cold brews.

1836
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:00,250
I had a cold brew today,

1837
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:01,720
just Caveman Coffee.

1838
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:02,651
This shit right here.

1839
00:58:02,651 --> 00:58:04,210
This stuff is God damn delicious.

1840
00:58:04,390 --> 00:58:05,620
Cold brew concentrate.

1841
00:58:05,770 --> 00:58:06,603
You take this,

1842
00:58:07,210 --> 00:58:12,210
he put a third of this in a bar in a
glass and then the two thirds water is

1843
00:58:12,251 --> 00:58:13,380
delicious and it's,

1844
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:14,201
it's awesome.

1845
00:58:14,201 --> 00:58:15,280
It's strong shit,

1846
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:17,290
but it's not 10 times stronger.

1847
00:58:17,870 --> 00:58:18,550
Um,

1848
00:58:18,550 --> 00:58:22,210
so a 16 ounce Starbuck bucks,

1849
00:58:22,211 --> 00:58:23,410
cold brew coffee,

1850
00:58:23,710 --> 00:58:24,550
16 ounce,

1851
00:58:24,551 --> 00:58:24,851
which is,

1852
00:58:24,851 --> 00:58:25,930
I guess they're small,

1853
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:26,320
right?

1854
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:28,060
It's 200 milligrams.

1855
00:58:28,330 --> 00:58:29,620
I don't think that's the small,

1856
00:58:29,621 --> 00:58:32,320
I think that's the
Grande's 16 200 milligrams.

1857
00:58:32,321 --> 00:58:35,530
I think that's standard
standard cold brew.

1858
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:37,020
That's a 16 ounces.

1859
00:58:37,030 --> 00:58:42,030
I think 200 is around what it
normally is a what's called Starbucks.

1860
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:44,080
What makes you say it's 10 times stronger?

1861
00:58:44,130 --> 00:58:45,550
That's what they told me at Starbucks.

1862
00:58:45,570 --> 00:58:45,830
Oh,

1863
00:58:45,830 --> 00:58:48,100
that's just some asshole behind
the counter at Starbucks.

1864
00:58:48,190 --> 00:58:48,580
Uh,

1865
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:49,710
trying to sell you a script.

1866
00:58:49,711 --> 00:58:50,544
Coffee.

1867
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:51,851
I'm stronger.

1868
00:58:51,851 --> 00:58:55,300
It was brewed on an island where
they make dinosaurs read my script.

1869
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:56,530
Uh,

1870
00:58:56,530 --> 00:59:01,530
a 16 ounce iced coffee has,

1871
00:59:03,610 --> 00:59:06,820
see where it said it's not 10 times.

1872
00:59:06,850 --> 00:59:07,121
I mean,

1873
00:59:07,121 --> 00:59:10,210
if it's slightly more
powerful I'd be surprised.

1874
00:59:11,110 --> 00:59:11,531
But you know,

1875
00:59:11,531 --> 00:59:12,910
Starbucks is a pretty strong anyway.

1876
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:15,010
Starbucks is way stronger
than most coffee.

1877
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:16,630
They put more coffee in the,

1878
00:59:16,631 --> 00:59:16,900
uh,

1879
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:18,760
more Grimes and the thing when they,

1880
00:59:18,790 --> 00:59:19,623
when they brew it up.

1881
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:21,980
But the shit that we

1882
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:22,813
serve here,

1883
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:24,200
this is pretty strong.

1884
00:59:24,230 --> 00:59:25,011
Jamie makes it pretty.

1885
00:59:25,011 --> 00:59:25,844
God Damn.

1886
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:27,450
Um,

1887
00:59:27,450 --> 00:59:30,960
thick ice coffee is,

1888
00:59:31,350 --> 00:59:33,050
did you see a Floyd Mayweather,

1889
00:59:33,051 --> 00:59:33,884
his new car?

1890
00:59:34,170 --> 00:59:34,950
He has a new car.

1891
00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:35,620
Oh yeah.

1892
00:59:35,620 --> 00:59:39,620
Was it a I don't even a
Codec Koenigsegg Kona Sig.

1893
00:59:39,930 --> 00:59:40,763
Yeah.

1894
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:41,340
Yeah.

1895
00:59:41,340 --> 00:59:42,031
I've seen those things.

1896
00:59:42,031 --> 00:59:43,350
Point 7 million it says,

1897
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:45,210
but come on,

1898
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:47,310
those things don't cost
six point $7 million.

1899
00:59:47,340 --> 00:59:48,930
Most things I was seen was 4.7.

1900
00:59:48,931 --> 00:59:50,670
This article right here says 6.7,

1901
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:51,893
one of two.

1902
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:53,640
Damn.

1903
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:54,240
Yeah.

1904
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:59,240
He drove it down to fat Burger on the
Strip two nights ago and such a crowd came

1905
00:59:59,251 --> 01:00:01,830
that he had to get a flatbed to take it
home because they didn't want to drive

1906
01:00:01,831 --> 01:00:02,480
it.

1907
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:03,140
Why?

1908
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:06,600
I said the article said he was too scared
to drive it home through the crowd,

1909
01:00:07,140 --> 01:00:08,880
through the crowd because he
didn't want to fuck it up.

1910
01:00:10,050 --> 01:00:11,010
That doesn't make any sense.

1911
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:11,550
Yeah.

1912
01:00:11,550 --> 01:00:11,761
Yeah.

1913
01:00:11,761 --> 01:00:12,521
It's not 10 times.

1914
01:00:12,521 --> 01:00:14,130
It's 40 milligrams more,

1915
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:16,430
but still it's more,

1916
01:00:16,470 --> 01:00:17,303
that's some guy

1917
01:00:18,890 --> 01:00:20,490
tell me that put me on
different dysentery.

1918
01:00:20,491 --> 01:00:21,690
I'll pretend that I'm a girl.

1919
01:00:22,250 --> 01:00:23,640
It's come on Rad band.

1920
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:25,290
If 10 times more

1921
01:00:27,810 --> 01:00:31,110
posting all day on Tmz and then I
came over here to work at Starbucks.

1922
01:00:31,130 --> 01:00:34,140
I don't want you to have me on your show,

1923
01:00:34,190 --> 01:00:35,023
man.

1924
01:00:35,030 --> 01:00:36,180
I'm on red band.

1925
01:00:37,350 --> 01:00:37,590
No.

1926
01:00:37,590 --> 01:00:40,320
What's stupid is that you believe
that I worked at Starbucks.

1927
01:00:40,940 --> 01:00:42,390
It seems pretty high and I thought,

1928
01:00:42,391 --> 01:00:43,290
and that doesn't seem right.

1929
01:00:43,350 --> 01:00:44,280
I saw this today.

1930
01:00:44,310 --> 01:00:45,210
Did you see this today?

1931
01:00:45,390 --> 01:00:50,390
A kid fell and accidentally
punched through a one point
$5 million painting play

1932
01:00:51,421 --> 01:00:53,220
that play that cause this hilarious.

1933
01:00:53,430 --> 01:00:54,150
First of all,

1934
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:58,230
how fucking stupid or day where you could
just have this thing right in front of

1935
01:00:58,231 --> 01:00:59,064
people.

1936
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:01,350
Like watch this kid's slips.

1937
01:01:02,670 --> 01:01:03,503
Oh.

1938
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:09,360
Holding his drink and punch through a
one point $5 million fucking painting.

1939
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:15,830
And then this lady comes over.

1940
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:16,750
All you

1941
01:01:18,650 --> 01:01:19,483
get out of here.

1942
01:01:22,580 --> 01:01:23,570
Who?

1943
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:24,230
Yeah.

1944
01:01:24,230 --> 01:01:24,621
How was that?

1945
01:01:24,621 --> 01:01:25,910
Just hang up right there.

1946
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,860
Why don't they have it in case in glass,

1947
01:01:28,220 --> 01:01:28,671
by the way.

1948
01:01:28,671 --> 01:01:31,820
I went to the La County Museum
of art inside of the day.

1949
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:32,720
Thank you.

1950
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:34,580
I'm just the one of the
worst pieces of shit.

1951
01:01:34,610 --> 01:01:35,930
Oh God.

1952
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:40,640
It is like a fucking scene in a movie
where you mock pretentious modern art.

1953
01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:41,060
Yeah.

1954
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:41,331
Dude,

1955
01:01:41,331 --> 01:01:43,790
I'm going to show you some pictures
and these are real fucking pictures.

1956
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:48,690
See the painting that was just a white
painting that had nothing on it or the

1957
01:01:48,691 --> 01:01:50,970
room where there's nothing
in it except a chair.

1958
01:01:51,050 --> 01:01:51,620
Yes,

1959
01:01:51,620 --> 01:01:52,240
I did.

1960
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:53,300
Even even better.

1961
01:01:53,301 --> 01:01:54,590
I saw the box.

1962
01:01:54,591 --> 01:01:56,000
Did you see the box?

1963
01:01:56,300 --> 01:01:56,751
Which uh,

1964
01:01:56,751 --> 01:01:57,051
they're,

1965
01:01:57,051 --> 01:02:01,760
they're trying to say is a work of
art is a fucking plexiglass box.

1966
01:02:01,790 --> 01:02:02,030
Yeah.

1967
01:02:02,030 --> 01:02:02,840
This is it.

1968
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:03,950
It's roped off.

1969
01:02:03,980 --> 01:02:04,401
Can you say that?

1970
01:02:04,401 --> 01:02:05,360
Can you focus it on that?

1971
01:02:06,170 --> 01:02:09,350
Just because some people could see how
fucking stupid this is and there's some

1972
01:02:09,351 --> 01:02:14,090
sort of pretentious explanation
for why this box is significant.

1973
01:02:14,270 --> 01:02:17,690
All it is is a fucking plexi glass box.

1974
01:02:18,050 --> 01:02:19,010
Like if you had it in your,

1975
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:21,420
it might make a cool coffee table I guess.

1976
01:02:21,421 --> 01:02:21,571
Like,

1977
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:21,691
oh,

1978
01:02:21,691 --> 01:02:22,830
that's a cool coffee table.

1979
01:02:22,950 --> 01:02:23,760
Where'd you get it?

1980
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:25,890
It's a priceless piece
of art from the Lockbox,

1981
01:02:26,130 --> 01:02:27,720
from La County Museum of art.

1982
01:02:28,230 --> 01:02:28,501
It,

1983
01:02:28,501 --> 01:02:30,180
that place is dog shit.

1984
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:33,360
It is one of the worst fucking
museums I've ever been to in my life.

1985
01:02:33,380 --> 01:02:33,890
Right.

1986
01:02:33,890 --> 01:02:38,180
I've gone on rants about this in
the past because I love art museums.

1987
01:02:38,181 --> 01:02:39,920
Had Columbus Art Museum in Columbus.

1988
01:02:39,921 --> 01:02:41,000
Ohio is a great museum.

1989
01:02:41,180 --> 01:02:41,601
I even,

1990
01:02:41,601 --> 01:02:42,980
the Huntington Library,

1991
01:02:43,230 --> 01:02:44,960
which is here in Pasadena,

1992
01:02:44,990 --> 01:02:48,260
I believe is one of the best
art museums I've ever been to.

1993
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:49,370
This one though.

1994
01:02:49,370 --> 01:02:50,930
I mean literally it was a joke.

1995
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:55,400
I was so pissed off after going to have
how many rooms you would just walk into

1996
01:02:55,401 --> 01:02:58,100
a room and they're just be like
a shoe and you're just like,

1997
01:02:58,101 --> 01:02:58,371
wait,

1998
01:02:58,371 --> 01:02:59,204
that's it

1999
01:02:59,490 --> 01:03:01,980
with my kids because
I thought it'd be fun.

2000
01:03:01,981 --> 01:03:03,750
Take the kids to the art museum.

2001
01:03:03,751 --> 01:03:04,650
My kids love art.

2002
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:06,780
Like they could see some
cool paintings and shit.

2003
01:03:07,290 --> 01:03:11,220
And I knew we were fucked when we first
got there cause we walked into this room

2004
01:03:11,490 --> 01:03:14,310
and it looks like there's
these curvy walls like,

2005
01:03:14,550 --> 01:03:15,420
and I felt like,

2006
01:03:15,421 --> 01:03:18,090
well you go inside the curvy walls
is probably some cool paintings.

2007
01:03:18,270 --> 01:03:18,660
No,

2008
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:21,450
the curvy walls where the fucking art.

2009
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:22,140
And I went,

2010
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:23,150
no,

2011
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:23,971
we're fucked.

2012
01:03:23,971 --> 01:03:25,470
It's one of these places.

2013
01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:29,370
And there was all these like super
pretentious people that were like,

2014
01:03:29,790 --> 01:03:30,630
please don't touch that.

2015
01:03:30,631 --> 01:03:31,201
Please don't touch that.

2016
01:03:31,201 --> 01:03:31,951
They're everywhere you go.

2017
01:03:31,951 --> 01:03:32,191
They're like,

2018
01:03:32,191 --> 01:03:32,671
don't touch,

2019
01:03:32,671 --> 01:03:33,181
don't touch,

2020
01:03:33,181 --> 01:03:33,980
don't touch.

2021
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:34,813
And one guy,

2022
01:03:34,890 --> 01:03:36,720
I had my five year old on my shoulders,

2023
01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:37,741
she could,

2024
01:03:37,741 --> 01:03:39,120
she likes climbing on top of me.

2025
01:03:39,121 --> 01:03:40,050
She climbs on me all the time.

2026
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:42,060
So she's sitting on my
shoulder and he's like,

2027
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:42,661
sir,

2028
01:03:42,661 --> 01:03:44,610
can you please take your
daughter off your shoulder?

2029
01:03:44,611 --> 01:03:45,660
It's a safety risk.

2030
01:03:45,870 --> 01:03:46,141
I'm like,

2031
01:03:46,141 --> 01:03:48,090
it's a safety risk for who?

2032
01:03:48,091 --> 01:03:48,924
For her.

2033
01:03:49,290 --> 01:03:49,471
I'm like,

2034
01:03:49,471 --> 01:03:50,370
I'm not going to drop.

2035
01:03:50,371 --> 01:03:51,750
Are you out of your fucking minds?

2036
01:03:51,751 --> 01:03:52,890
A safety risk?

2037
01:03:54,020 --> 01:03:57,350
I highly recommend taking them
to the Huntington Library.

2038
01:03:57,380 --> 01:03:59,570
It's a cool place where they have gardens.

2039
01:03:59,870 --> 01:04:00,350
They have like,

2040
01:04:00,350 --> 01:04:01,220
I don't know how many gardens,

2041
01:04:01,221 --> 01:04:02,210
like 10 different gardens.

2042
01:04:02,430 --> 01:04:02,700
Yeah,

2043
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:03,180
it's cool.

2044
01:04:03,180 --> 01:04:03,780
It's garden.

2045
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:04,670
It's like a different like,

2046
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:04,881
oh,

2047
01:04:04,881 --> 01:04:05,720
I'm in Japan now.

2048
01:04:05,750 --> 01:04:08,360
It's like they also have one of
the best art collections ever,

2049
01:04:08,361 --> 01:04:11,750
including like the blue boy and a bunch
of really famous paintings where you're

2050
01:04:11,751 --> 01:04:11,930
like,

2051
01:04:11,930 --> 01:04:12,081
oh,

2052
01:04:12,081 --> 01:04:12,920
that's interesting.

2053
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,390
That's the official,

2054
01:04:14,420 --> 01:04:17,090
their original Abraham Lincoln
painting or whatever it is.

2055
01:04:17,091 --> 01:04:17,350
You know,

2056
01:04:17,350 --> 01:04:17,621
the,

2057
01:04:17,621 --> 01:04:18,160
uh,

2058
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:19,030
LACMA.

2059
01:04:19,180 --> 01:04:20,800
Is it also,

2060
01:04:20,830 --> 01:04:22,480
what does that a rock
that they have there?

2061
01:04:22,510 --> 01:04:23,410
That's one of their things.

2062
01:04:24,090 --> 01:04:24,850
It's just a big rock.

2063
01:04:24,850 --> 01:04:25,601
Fucking hit.

2064
01:04:25,601 --> 01:04:26,434
Somebody,

2065
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:27,730
God dammit.

2066
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:28,833
They had not,

2067
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:34,360
I paid and I didn't have to pay
because I'm a resident of La County.

2068
01:04:34,361 --> 01:04:35,194
You get in for free.

2069
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:36,041
But I said,

2070
01:04:36,041 --> 01:04:36,341
you know what?

2071
01:04:36,341 --> 01:04:37,120
I want to contribute,

2072
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:37,901
I want to contribute to,

2073
01:04:37,901 --> 01:04:39,300
so I paid and then I just,

2074
01:04:39,790 --> 01:04:41,470
then they had fucking jazz,

2075
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:43,180
which is my other least favorite thing.

2076
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:45,670
They had that and jazz together.

2077
01:04:45,850 --> 01:04:50,620
It's like super pretentious meets Uber
pretentious and they collide in a fucking

2078
01:04:50,621 --> 01:04:52,150
shit storm of hipsters.

2079
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:53,500
Oh my God.

2080
01:04:53,501 --> 01:04:54,520
It was so gross.

2081
01:04:54,610 --> 01:04:55,570
Then on top of it,

2082
01:04:55,750 --> 01:04:58,330
like they have all these art
books for sale and we're like,

2083
01:04:58,331 --> 01:05:02,290
well maybe they have some cool art books
and this fucking Shit head with his

2084
01:05:02,291 --> 01:05:03,860
rolled cuffed jeans.

2085
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:04,421
I like,

2086
01:05:04,421 --> 01:05:05,380
please be careful.

2087
01:05:05,381 --> 01:05:06,580
That's a delicate book.

2088
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:06,941
I go,

2089
01:05:06,941 --> 01:05:07,061
no,

2090
01:05:07,061 --> 01:05:07,960
it's not a delicate book.

2091
01:05:07,961 --> 01:05:08,794
It's a book.

2092
01:05:09,010 --> 01:05:10,060
It's just a book.

2093
01:05:10,061 --> 01:05:10,894
You fuck.

2094
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:12,550
It's all it is is a book.

2095
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:14,920
It's made at a paper like regular paper,

2096
01:05:14,921 --> 01:05:17,890
like a regular book you clown.

2097
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:20,950
That was one of the biggest
disappointments in my life
because I wasn't looking

2098
01:05:20,951 --> 01:05:21,491
forward to it,

2099
01:05:21,491 --> 01:05:23,290
so it wasn't being rough with the book.

2100
01:05:23,291 --> 01:05:24,160
I was going to touch the buck.

2101
01:05:24,161 --> 01:05:25,180
My seven year old was,

2102
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:28,450
but she was just gently leafing
through the pages of the book.

2103
01:05:28,451 --> 01:05:29,860
She wasn't doing anything rough

2104
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:36,550
assholes and county funded assholes.

2105
01:05:36,820 --> 01:05:40,060
That's the gross thing is that
tax dollars go to support this.

2106
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:42,190
They have one exhibit that's all junk.

2107
01:05:42,340 --> 01:05:43,480
It's called junk.

2108
01:05:43,610 --> 01:05:46,210
That's like part of the name of
the exhibit and you go there,

2109
01:05:46,330 --> 01:05:49,480
it's like bottle caps that are
glued to like a cork board.

2110
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:52,470
Like you fucks you motherfuckers.

2111
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:52,661
You,

2112
01:05:52,661 --> 01:05:56,110
you put this on a frame and hung
it on the wall and you actually,

2113
01:05:56,111 --> 01:05:59,170
you're charging people
to see this dog shit.

2114
01:05:59,470 --> 01:06:01,390
I mean just total dog shit.

2115
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:04,360
And what a waste of valuable
space in Los Angeles.

2116
01:06:04,361 --> 01:06:08,740
I mean there's rooms like 10 times bigger
than my house where it's just a light

2117
01:06:08,741 --> 01:06:09,100
bulb.

2118
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:10,810
This should just let
homeless people move in.

2119
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:11,913
They really should.

2120
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:15,550
That should be the new museum is
the homeless people shit collection.

2121
01:06:15,850 --> 01:06:17,330
Just slip them shit all over the ground.

2122
01:06:17,370 --> 01:06:21,640
You splay spray plastic on it to
seal it and keep it in place forever.

2123
01:06:21,940 --> 01:06:23,770
Like the homeless people Turd pile.

2124
01:06:23,890 --> 01:06:26,770
That would be like more interesting
than anything they had there.

2125
01:06:26,950 --> 01:06:27,461
If you like,

2126
01:06:27,461 --> 01:06:28,390
let homeless people,

2127
01:06:28,391 --> 01:06:28,721
Shit,

2128
01:06:28,721 --> 01:06:29,710
you can come in and shit,

2129
01:06:29,830 --> 01:06:32,530
but you'd have to shit in this one
spot and you go under the ropes.

2130
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:32,801
There's,

2131
01:06:32,801 --> 01:06:33,634
that's it.

2132
01:06:33,670 --> 01:06:34,570
That's the fucking,

2133
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:36,940
that's that fucking thing man.

2134
01:06:36,970 --> 01:06:37,870
God Damn it.

2135
01:06:37,871 --> 01:06:38,890
That makes me angry.

2136
01:06:39,070 --> 01:06:40,060
This wall,

2137
01:06:40,210 --> 01:06:40,991
this curvy wall,

2138
01:06:40,991 --> 01:06:41,870
which is Kinda cool.

2139
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:42,130
You know,

2140
01:06:42,130 --> 01:06:43,270
if it was like in your house,

2141
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:43,850
I be like,

2142
01:06:43,850 --> 01:06:44,001
oh,

2143
01:06:44,001 --> 01:06:44,890
you have cool walls.

2144
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:47,530
But to say that that's
a piece of sculpture.

2145
01:06:47,710 --> 01:06:48,970
The fuck it is.

2146
01:06:49,750 --> 01:06:50,583
Fuck you.

2147
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:51,800
How about that other one?

2148
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:52,660
The upper right hand corner.

2149
01:06:52,670 --> 01:06:53,680
The like the sticks.

2150
01:06:53,740 --> 01:06:55,150
So the sticks they have like,

2151
01:06:55,210 --> 01:06:57,160
they have like a half
of a fucking side of,

2152
01:06:57,161 --> 01:06:57,640
uh,

2153
01:06:57,640 --> 01:06:58,540
of a barn.

2154
01:06:58,720 --> 01:06:59,051
Ooh,

2155
01:06:59,051 --> 01:06:59,884
look at us.

2156
01:07:00,220 --> 01:07:01,060
We're crazy.

2157
01:07:01,690 --> 01:07:02,180
We're crazy.

2158
01:07:02,180 --> 01:07:02,981
Look at the one below it.

2159
01:07:02,981 --> 01:07:04,180
That's like a half of a house.

2160
01:07:04,390 --> 01:07:05,223
Oh look.

2161
01:07:05,260 --> 01:07:08,080
It's like this is what a house
would look like if it was here.

2162
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:09,820
You fucking assholes.

2163
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:13,060
I'm so angry.

2164
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:14,200
I was angry though.

2165
01:07:14,201 --> 01:07:15,220
You know why I was angry?

2166
01:07:15,340 --> 01:07:16,390
Because I was going to take my,

2167
01:07:16,420 --> 01:07:18,910
I was trying to figure
out which way to go.

2168
01:07:19,090 --> 01:07:23,320
Should we go to the Museum of art or
should we go to the Museum of natural

2169
01:07:23,321 --> 01:07:28,090
history so we see dinosaurs and cool shit
from the past or should we see art and

2170
01:07:28,091 --> 01:07:28,930
we went with art.

2171
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:30,910
Huge mistake.

2172
01:07:31,540 --> 01:07:32,770
Don't go again.

2173
01:07:33,010 --> 01:07:34,270
Massive area.

2174
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:34,931
And not only that,

2175
01:07:34,931 --> 01:07:39,610
this area is near one of the most
important natural areas in Los Angeles,

2176
01:07:39,730 --> 01:07:41,410
which is labrea tar pits.

2177
01:07:42,580 --> 01:07:44,410
See if you find the junk collection,

2178
01:07:44,411 --> 01:07:47,710
because if you want to fucking
scoop your eyes out with spoons,

2179
01:07:48,950 --> 01:07:51,520
it's fucking junk collection.

2180
01:07:51,580 --> 01:07:53,020
Oh God.

2181
01:07:53,980 --> 01:07:54,860
God Damn,

2182
01:07:54,870 --> 01:07:55,750
it makes me angry.

2183
01:07:56,410 --> 01:07:57,670
It was so gross.

2184
01:07:57,880 --> 01:07:59,350
So gross and stupid.

2185
01:08:00,250 --> 01:08:01,470
But like this is the,

2186
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:02,410
see that one over there.

2187
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:03,220
Scroll down there.

2188
01:08:03,220 --> 01:08:05,830
The one with the feathers and the
black right to the readier cursor.

2189
01:08:06,010 --> 01:08:07,480
This is the tar and feather.

2190
01:08:07,930 --> 01:08:09,580
This is the tar and feather piece.

2191
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:12,790
This represents tar and feathers.

2192
01:08:13,030 --> 01:08:13,810
No it doesn't.

2193
01:08:13,810 --> 01:08:17,450
It's just feathers that you glued to a
board and you're making people look at

2194
01:08:17,451 --> 01:08:17,600
it.

2195
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:18,110
You don't think,

2196
01:08:18,110 --> 01:08:22,070
you don't think people know what
the fuck tar and feathers was like.

2197
01:08:22,071 --> 01:08:22,311
What do you,

2198
01:08:22,311 --> 01:08:24,980
what are you trying to say when you're
trying to say whether your shitty piece

2199
01:08:24,981 --> 01:08:27,740
of art is just like a kids' science fair?

2200
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:28,401
You know what I mean?

2201
01:08:28,401 --> 01:08:28,901
Like when they're eight,

2202
01:08:28,901 --> 01:08:31,090
nine and a half per
preconstruction board thing,

2203
01:08:31,450 --> 01:08:34,340
like Yoko Ono is somehow
responsible for this museum.

2204
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:39,050
Well Yoko Ono had an exhibit that I want
to see once in Boston and one of the

2205
01:08:39,051 --> 01:08:42,920
exhibits was a block of
wood with nails in it.

2206
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:45,680
And next to that was a,

2207
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:48,890
a box of nails and a hammer.

2208
01:08:49,730 --> 01:08:52,880
And they asked Yoko
Ono and they said like,

2209
01:08:52,881 --> 01:08:53,840
well what is this about?

2210
01:08:53,990 --> 01:08:54,590
And she said,

2211
01:08:54,590 --> 01:08:56,960
I want people to contribute.

2212
01:08:57,440 --> 01:08:59,510
They be enthusiastic about the odd.

2213
01:08:59,511 --> 01:09:00,530
So they contribute.

2214
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:05,680
So she encouraged people to pick up a
nail that's it and hammer the fucking nail

2215
01:09:06,081 --> 01:09:07,310
into that block of wood.

2216
01:09:07,311 --> 01:09:07,850
She,

2217
01:09:07,850 --> 01:09:08,241
and I'm like,

2218
01:09:08,241 --> 01:09:09,740
if you want people to be enthusiastic,

2219
01:09:10,070 --> 01:09:12,680
take the nails and put
them in your forehead.

2220
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:15,290
Just put them right in your
forehead and let people lack those.

2221
01:09:15,710 --> 01:09:17,510
You'll have a line around the block.

2222
01:09:18,350 --> 01:09:20,450
People sign up months in advance.

2223
01:09:20,690 --> 01:09:21,523
Look at her art,

2224
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:22,900
would it,

2225
01:09:22,900 --> 01:09:23,601
what does that say?

2226
01:09:23,601 --> 01:09:24,351
Incredible.

2227
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:25,080
What?

2228
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:26,780
See what Yoko Ono's incredible.

2229
01:09:26,781 --> 01:09:29,210
What video they,

2230
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:32,690
they better be joking to better be joking.

2231
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:33,530
Come on.

2232
01:09:33,530 --> 01:09:34,460
Reaffirms that.

2233
01:09:34,461 --> 01:09:35,780
She's the queen of everything.

2234
01:09:35,900 --> 01:09:37,160
Is that really what it says?

2235
01:09:37,610 --> 01:09:38,720
Oh my God.

2236
01:09:40,220 --> 01:09:41,660
Yoko Ono's incredible new video.

2237
01:09:41,661 --> 01:09:43,580
Reaffirm she's the queen of everything.

2238
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:44,481
No,

2239
01:09:44,481 --> 01:09:48,230
she's a queen of tricking John
Lennon and to being with her.

2240
01:09:48,770 --> 01:09:49,730
Oh my God.

2241
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:51,770
Yoko Ono.

2242
01:09:51,771 --> 01:09:53,690
Plastic Ono band.

2243
01:09:54,380 --> 01:09:58,520
And she's like dancing and screaming
and you want to hear it because it's

2244
01:09:58,521 --> 01:09:59,354
amazing.

2245
01:10:09,630 --> 01:10:09,781
Yeah.

2246
01:10:09,781 --> 01:10:12,560
What's up dude from quest?

2247
01:10:12,570 --> 01:10:13,403
Love is there.

2248
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,160
Why did you do a quest?

2249
01:10:17,420 --> 01:10:20,160
I'm a bad dancer with no regrets.

2250
01:10:21,670 --> 01:10:22,503
Fuck.

2251
01:10:23,190 --> 01:10:26,290
And we got interrupted by a pop
up for huff post newsletter.

2252
01:10:26,620 --> 01:10:26,840
No,

2253
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:27,670
don't want you to newsletter.

2254
01:10:27,670 --> 01:10:28,503
No,

2255
01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:29,381
no,

2256
01:10:29,381 --> 01:10:29,581
no.

2257
01:10:29,581 --> 01:10:29,801
Now,

2258
01:10:29,801 --> 01:10:30,041
now,

2259
01:10:30,041 --> 01:10:30,874
now.

2260
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,650
So see that Ted Cruz guy with them.

2261
01:10:33,690 --> 01:10:33,970
Um,

2262
01:10:33,970 --> 01:10:38,650
I know someone who's having Ted Cruz
come over their house for a fundraiser

2263
01:10:39,140 --> 01:10:42,000
because they're a big
supporter of Israel and uh,

2264
01:10:42,810 --> 01:10:43,720
we're invited to go.

2265
01:10:44,110 --> 01:10:45,370
I'm trying to figure out if I should go.

2266
01:10:45,730 --> 01:10:46,451
Some people are saying,

2267
01:10:46,451 --> 01:10:47,860
I should go just for the material,

2268
01:10:48,670 --> 01:10:49,210
but I'm like,

2269
01:10:49,210 --> 01:10:49,541
no,

2270
01:10:49,541 --> 01:10:50,470
I'm just going to get angry.

2271
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:51,880
I don't want to get angry.

2272
01:10:51,940 --> 01:10:52,750
That mean,

2273
01:10:52,750 --> 01:10:54,100
have you ever heard that guy talk?

2274
01:10:54,270 --> 01:10:55,030
He's take,

2275
01:10:55,030 --> 01:10:55,560
why don't you,

2276
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:56,171
that's a good,

2277
01:10:56,171 --> 01:10:56,890
good question.

2278
01:10:56,890 --> 01:11:01,390
Why don't you Google Ted Cruz is a
dummy and then find whatever videos they

2279
01:11:01,391 --> 01:11:01,840
have.

2280
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:03,070
He's like Sarah Palin.

2281
01:11:03,071 --> 01:11:04,990
If he was a guy with a head injury,

2282
01:11:05,710 --> 01:11:07,960
if Sarah Palin was a guy
and he got hit in the head,

2283
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:10,810
he's not really running for president.

2284
01:11:10,811 --> 01:11:11,770
I agree with that.

2285
01:11:12,250 --> 01:11:13,560
Let's listen to talk.

2286
01:11:13,710 --> 01:11:15,330
He's just so fucking stupid.

2287
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:17,190
Son Wasn't born in America,

2288
01:11:17,191 --> 01:11:18,600
so I don't know how he's
going to be a president.

2289
01:11:18,810 --> 01:11:20,310
He's born in Canadian land.

2290
01:11:21,810 --> 01:11:22,643
Okay.

2291
01:11:22,770 --> 01:11:23,670
And they would never have them

2292
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:27,380
listen to him talk.

2293
01:11:27,380 --> 01:11:30,700
It's just subject to coddle and
appease our enemies and so putting,

2294
01:11:30,710 --> 01:11:35,090
you better believe Putin sees and Ben
Gazi for Americans are murdered and

2295
01:11:35,091 --> 01:11:36,050
nothing happens.

2296
01:11:36,051 --> 01:11:37,130
There's no retribution.

2297
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:41,180
You better believe that
Putin sees that in Syria.

2298
01:11:41,510 --> 01:11:43,720
Obama draws a red light
and ignores the red line.

2299
01:11:44,250 --> 01:11:44,400
Well,

2300
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:44,911
first of all,

2301
01:11:44,911 --> 01:11:45,744
stop right there.

2302
01:11:46,410 --> 01:11:47,460
Sounds like a gay man to me.

2303
01:11:48,090 --> 01:11:48,923
Is that a gay man?

2304
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:51,000
That does not sound,

2305
01:11:51,001 --> 01:11:51,271
I mean,

2306
01:11:51,271 --> 01:11:51,600
not,

2307
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:53,070
not to stereotype too late,

2308
01:11:53,790 --> 01:11:55,650
but there's a certain,

2309
01:11:55,860 --> 01:11:59,970
there's a reason why we have
this stereotypical gay voice.

2310
01:12:00,270 --> 01:12:01,170
There's a reason.

2311
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:05,130
Why is that reason Brian's
getting fucked in the ass so much.

2312
01:12:05,131 --> 01:12:06,240
That makes it voice go high.

2313
01:12:06,241 --> 01:12:06,540
Oh,

2314
01:12:06,540 --> 01:12:07,050
no,

2315
01:12:07,050 --> 01:12:07,883
no,

2316
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:08,400
no.

2317
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:10,260
Because that's what they talk like.

2318
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:10,621
Okay.

2319
01:12:10,621 --> 01:12:11,100
Listen,

2320
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:12,540
if I talked to you like this,

2321
01:12:13,170 --> 01:12:13,800
what am I,

2322
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:15,000
what do I sound like Brian?

2323
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:19,050
Who do I sound like Brian
[inaudible] large black man,

2324
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:20,070
right?

2325
01:12:20,070 --> 01:12:20,870
Large black man.

2326
01:12:20,870 --> 01:12:22,880
A confident large black
man is threatening.

2327
01:12:23,270 --> 01:12:25,970
Why we recognize that
these exist in nature.

2328
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:26,270
Right?

2329
01:12:26,270 --> 01:12:26,481
Okay.

2330
01:12:26,481 --> 01:12:27,314
Here's one.

2331
01:12:27,620 --> 01:12:28,660
What does that it's a bird.

2332
01:12:28,700 --> 01:12:29,533
Herodeck okay.

2333
01:12:29,690 --> 01:12:29,910
No.

2334
01:12:29,910 --> 01:12:30,743
PTERODACTYL

2335
01:12:30,910 --> 01:12:31,743
wow.

2336
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:34,171
But you know what I'm saying?

2337
01:12:34,171 --> 01:12:36,450
Like there's sounds that
things make and you go,

2338
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:36,661
oh,

2339
01:12:36,661 --> 01:12:37,560
I know what that is.

2340
01:12:38,010 --> 01:12:41,460
I my fucking Gaydar says that's a gay man.

2341
01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:42,360
Sure.

2342
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:43,770
Listen to him talk one more time please.

2343
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:44,760
Nothing to,

2344
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:45,211
first of all,

2345
01:12:45,211 --> 01:12:46,410
I love gay people.

2346
01:12:46,470 --> 01:12:49,890
It's nothing wrong with gay people
and not all gay people talk like this.

2347
01:12:50,490 --> 01:12:51,740
We've had gay people in the park,

2348
01:12:51,780 --> 01:12:52,560
like Josh Zaps.

2349
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:53,430
You would never know.

2350
01:12:53,610 --> 01:12:55,440
Looking at him or hearing
him talk that he's gay.

2351
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:57,030
Obviously he's gay.

2352
01:12:57,540 --> 01:12:59,940
Talks about being gay
unless it's a smokescreen.

2353
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:02,220
This man says he's not gay.

2354
01:13:02,650 --> 01:13:02,900
Ted.

2355
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:06,030
We will repeal every
single word of Obamacare.

2356
01:13:08,620 --> 01:13:09,453
It was big.

2357
01:13:09,750 --> 01:13:10,910
Old people are clapping,

2358
01:13:11,090 --> 01:13:12,350
you know one of the old
people are clapping.

2359
01:13:12,351 --> 01:13:12,510
Yep.

2360
01:13:12,510 --> 01:13:15,430
Fi's politic parties is
their top priorities.

2361
01:13:15,450 --> 01:13:19,530
Preserving their own hide and if enough
congressional Democrats realize they

2362
01:13:19,531 --> 01:13:23,070
either stand with Obama care and lose
or they listened to the American people

2363
01:13:23,071 --> 01:13:24,540
and have a chance at staying in office.

2364
01:13:24,750 --> 01:13:25,860
That's the one scenario.

2365
01:13:25,861 --> 01:13:28,470
We could do it in 2015 if not,

2366
01:13:29,010 --> 01:13:29,910
we'll do it in 27

2367
01:13:30,110 --> 01:13:30,410
okay.

2368
01:13:30,410 --> 01:13:31,041
Cut Right there.

2369
01:13:31,041 --> 01:13:33,440
Dad is a guy who's barely
keeping it together.

2370
01:13:33,620 --> 01:13:35,250
He can't wait till that interview is over.

2371
01:13:35,251 --> 01:13:39,290
If she could run out of there and throw
a dress on and put some makeup on and

2372
01:13:39,291 --> 01:13:44,180
some women's shoes and just rip his
underwear a par and just take it from

2373
01:13:44,181 --> 01:13:44,930
behind.

2374
01:13:44,930 --> 01:13:49,820
There's not a doubt in my mind that that
guy can't wait until that interview is

2375
01:13:49,821 --> 01:13:51,710
over for him to be himself.

2376
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:54,770
He's barely holding it back like a dam,

2377
01:13:55,220 --> 01:13:55,610
like a,

2378
01:13:55,610 --> 01:13:56,443
a bellboy,

2379
01:13:56,540 --> 01:14:00,710
creaky wooden dam holding
back the river of his gayness,

2380
01:14:00,980 --> 01:14:04,310
a powerful glacial river of gayness.

2381
01:14:05,630 --> 01:14:05,950
He,

2382
01:14:05,950 --> 01:14:06,783
uh,

2383
01:14:08,570 --> 01:14:09,860
am I right or am I right?

2384
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:14,020
I a fucking challenge anybody to argue
with me that that's not an a feminine

2385
01:14:14,021 --> 01:14:14,854
man.

2386
01:14:15,430 --> 01:14:17,200
Strongly a feminine man.

2387
01:14:17,380 --> 01:14:18,220
Which again,

2388
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:19,690
there's nothing wrong with that.

2389
01:14:20,940 --> 01:14:21,721
I don't know that guy,

2390
01:14:21,721 --> 01:14:22,860
but he seemed kind of guy.

2391
01:14:23,050 --> 01:14:24,340
I would like a gay president.

2392
01:14:24,610 --> 01:14:25,780
I would love a gay president.

2393
01:14:26,470 --> 01:14:27,400
We could use it.

2394
01:14:27,820 --> 01:14:29,080
We can use a gay president.

2395
01:14:29,530 --> 01:14:30,490
We've had a black one.

2396
01:14:31,090 --> 01:14:33,130
I think gay be gay before woman.

2397
01:14:33,610 --> 01:14:34,443
Lesbian.

2398
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:35,770
Strong gay.

2399
01:14:35,770 --> 01:14:36,281
Strong gay.

2400
01:14:36,281 --> 01:14:36,830
Ma'Am.

2401
01:14:36,830 --> 01:14:37,600
I'm ma'am.

2402
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:38,500
Lesbian one shore.

2403
01:14:38,501 --> 01:14:40,080
As long as she doesn't hate man one.

2404
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:42,490
This is not one that had a
rough experience with men.

2405
01:14:43,690 --> 01:14:44,021
I met her,

2406
01:14:44,021 --> 01:14:44,651
Dick's to women,

2407
01:14:44,651 --> 01:14:44,861
man,

2408
01:14:44,861 --> 01:14:45,694
I don't want that.

2409
01:14:45,890 --> 01:14:47,290
They don't want anybody with prejudices.

2410
01:14:47,980 --> 01:14:48,370
You know,

2411
01:14:48,370 --> 01:14:50,330
you're not responsible for all
the men that had been Dick's,

2412
01:14:50,350 --> 01:14:51,183
that woman.

2413
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:55,210
What lesbians do you know that you
think could be a fine leader other than

2414
01:14:55,211 --> 01:14:56,044
Hillary Clinton?

2415
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:57,633
She gay

2416
01:14:58,870 --> 01:14:59,770
or asexual?

2417
01:15:01,150 --> 01:15:01,871
She is married,

2418
01:15:01,871 --> 01:15:02,704
I don't know.

2419
01:15:03,220 --> 01:15:04,053
Good call.

2420
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:04,990
So it's Ted Cruz.

2421
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:06,330
Melissa Athletic.

2422
01:15:06,670 --> 01:15:07,810
That's a good call.

2423
01:15:08,050 --> 01:15:08,860
I'll say Melissa,

2424
01:15:08,860 --> 01:15:10,390
but Melissa Etheridge thanks.

2425
01:15:11,050 --> 01:15:11,650
And uh,

2426
01:15:11,650 --> 01:15:12,460
love her to death.

2427
01:15:12,460 --> 01:15:14,800
But she also thinks that
if she's on a plane,

2428
01:15:14,830 --> 01:15:18,760
everyone in the plane doesn't have to
worry because she will not be in a plane

2429
01:15:18,761 --> 01:15:20,740
that crashes because she
creates her own reality.

2430
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:22,033
That that's true.

2431
01:15:22,730 --> 01:15:23,420
You think that's true?

2432
01:15:23,420 --> 01:15:24,180
Yeah.

2433
01:15:24,180 --> 01:15:24,460
Hm.

2434
01:15:24,460 --> 01:15:25,330
It's hair stimulation.

2435
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:27,190
There's no evidence to the contrary.

2436
01:15:27,191 --> 01:15:30,250
It's like when we had Burt on and Bert
was talking about how he doesn't believe

2437
01:15:30,251 --> 01:15:31,084
that you die.

2438
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:31,491
He goes,

2439
01:15:31,491 --> 01:15:32,230
prove he die.

2440
01:15:32,230 --> 01:15:33,063
I don't think you do die.

2441
01:15:33,260 --> 01:15:34,280
Prove you die.

2442
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:34,640
I was like,

2443
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:35,020
well,

2444
01:15:35,020 --> 01:15:35,860
it got a good point.

2445
01:15:36,460 --> 01:15:37,570
Can't really prove it right.

2446
01:15:37,630 --> 01:15:37,931
I mean,

2447
01:15:37,931 --> 01:15:42,340
you know that people have died in your
life and you know the things do dive.

2448
01:15:42,341 --> 01:15:44,620
You've ever seen a person
die or seen a thing?

2449
01:15:44,621 --> 01:15:45,190
Die.

2450
01:15:45,190 --> 01:15:46,023
Things die.

2451
01:15:46,330 --> 01:15:48,320
But do you die or not?

2452
01:15:48,580 --> 01:15:49,210
Who knows?

2453
01:15:49,210 --> 01:15:49,601
Who knows what?

2454
01:15:49,601 --> 01:15:50,411
This is even real.

2455
01:15:50,411 --> 01:15:51,790
If you're listening to my voice,

2456
01:15:51,791 --> 01:15:53,350
you have no idea if you die.

2457
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:54,790
You really don't.

2458
01:15:54,790 --> 01:15:57,130
You as far as you know,

2459
01:15:57,160 --> 01:15:58,990
I am a figment of your imagination.

2460
01:15:59,140 --> 01:16:01,180
You have created this entire reality.

2461
01:16:01,181 --> 01:16:03,910
Everything from streetlights
to fucking clouds.

2462
01:16:04,150 --> 01:16:09,100
Everything is all a part of
your absolutely spectacular
and vivid imagination.

2463
01:16:09,550 --> 01:16:10,870
Every experience that you have,

2464
01:16:10,871 --> 01:16:15,871
every sensory experience that you've
taken into your entire life may in fact be

2465
01:16:16,091 --> 01:16:17,050
a part of your,

2466
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:20,140
your brain trying to make
sense of your imagination.

2467
01:16:21,780 --> 01:16:22,900
And then there's Ted Cruz.

2468
01:16:23,420 --> 01:16:24,580
It's just dreaming about Dicks.

2469
01:16:29,460 --> 01:16:29,941
I believe it.

2470
01:16:29,941 --> 01:16:31,170
I think we are all program.

2471
01:16:31,230 --> 01:16:32,063
I still believe it.

2472
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:33,600
Well you believe in simulation theory,

2473
01:16:33,890 --> 01:16:34,290
right?

2474
01:16:34,290 --> 01:16:37,050
I believe that we are all
a program in the future.

2475
01:16:37,140 --> 01:16:38,490
And you know,

2476
01:16:38,491 --> 01:16:43,491
I was thinking of how's your program so
weird cause I'm stoned somewhere in 2000

2477
01:16:43,771 --> 01:16:44,604
years from now.

2478
01:16:44,970 --> 01:16:45,803
But uh,

2479
01:16:45,900 --> 01:16:48,480
I was thinking how weird it is that we,

2480
01:16:48,510 --> 01:16:49,343
we'd never,

2481
01:16:49,590 --> 01:16:52,770
no one is born in remembers anything.

2482
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:53,010
You know,

2483
01:16:53,010 --> 01:16:54,030
the first couple of years,

2484
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:56,040
usually at least one year,

2485
01:16:56,070 --> 01:16:56,401
you know,

2486
01:16:56,401 --> 01:17:01,230
like you're kind of just born and
then you're slowly diluted into being,

2487
01:17:01,231 --> 01:17:01,471
hey,

2488
01:17:01,471 --> 01:17:02,280
I'm alive.

2489
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:02,911
Person,

2490
01:17:02,911 --> 01:17:03,420
you know,

2491
01:17:03,420 --> 01:17:06,960
and it's like this whole gray
area where you just kind of,

2492
01:17:06,961 --> 01:17:07,201
yeah,

2493
01:17:07,201 --> 01:17:08,490
at the beginning that
you're just kind of like,

2494
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:10,160
I guess I

2495
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:10,880
uh,

2496
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:12,710
well there's a guy who
has a theory about that,

2497
01:17:12,711 --> 01:17:13,760
which is pretty fascinating.

2498
01:17:13,761 --> 01:17:14,960
I forget the gentleman's name,

2499
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:20,560
but what he said was that you are not
really thinking like thinking as we know

2500
01:17:21,801 --> 01:17:26,801
it does not exist until you learn language
and that until then all you're doing

2501
01:17:29,091 --> 01:17:32,270
is like having sensations
and reactions to them.

2502
01:17:32,271 --> 01:17:33,590
But you don't have reference,

2503
01:17:33,860 --> 01:17:36,470
you know when your mom was there
because your mom gives you love.

2504
01:17:36,471 --> 01:17:39,540
You remember that she gave you love and
so he looked forward to you cry to get

2505
01:17:39,541 --> 01:17:42,230
her and that she's in there and you're
like the love is coming but you don't

2506
01:17:42,231 --> 01:17:44,180
have an internal dialogue.

2507
01:17:44,330 --> 01:17:45,170
You don't know that.

2508
01:17:45,230 --> 01:17:45,530
Like,

2509
01:17:45,530 --> 01:17:46,550
oh here comes my mom.

2510
01:17:46,580 --> 01:17:47,211
Give up the tip,

2511
01:17:47,211 --> 01:17:47,540
bitch,

2512
01:17:47,540 --> 01:17:47,901
come on,

2513
01:17:47,901 --> 01:17:48,770
I'm going to suck on some tea.

2514
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:49,633
Get me some milk.

2515
01:17:49,820 --> 01:17:53,600
That's why it's funny when you have a
meme with like a kid thinking cause you

2516
01:17:53,601 --> 01:17:56,210
know the kids don't really
think like that or kids words.

2517
01:17:56,900 --> 01:17:57,290
They,

2518
01:17:57,290 --> 01:18:00,770
the idea is that once
we develop a language,

2519
01:18:00,771 --> 01:18:04,790
then we can put things into context and
then we have words for all these things

2520
01:18:04,791 --> 01:18:05,900
like chair,

2521
01:18:05,901 --> 01:18:06,501
floor,

2522
01:18:06,501 --> 01:18:07,730
door light,

2523
01:18:08,030 --> 01:18:10,280
and we have this thing in our head like,

2524
01:18:10,730 --> 01:18:11,240
man,

2525
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:12,860
someone shut that fucking door.

2526
01:18:12,861 --> 01:18:16,220
I'm tired of seeing that
light come through and then
you have that in your head.

2527
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:19,490
If they would just shut that door than
the fucking light wouldn't come through.

2528
01:18:19,700 --> 01:18:20,001
God,

2529
01:18:20,001 --> 01:18:22,910
I gotta get up in the morning and you
have this internal dialogue and once that

2530
01:18:22,940 --> 01:18:25,340
internal dialogue comes on,

2531
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:26,120
you know,

2532
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:29,570
talking about anything else that you
have a point of reference for or a word

2533
01:18:29,571 --> 01:18:30,200
for,

2534
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:31,820
then you're really thinking,

2535
01:18:32,180 --> 01:18:37,180
so what a kid is doing is
like experiencing a bunch
of things but not thinking

2536
01:18:37,191 --> 01:18:37,820
about it.

2537
01:18:37,820 --> 01:18:40,370
They're not like recalling
like they see it again.

2538
01:18:40,371 --> 01:18:40,920
There'll be scared.

2539
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:41,900
Like the dog barked.

2540
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:42,530
Ah,

2541
01:18:42,530 --> 01:18:44,660
the dog freaked out and you see the dog,

2542
01:18:44,750 --> 01:18:46,130
oh the sound's coming,

2543
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:47,450
but do you have this?

2544
01:18:48,050 --> 01:18:50,450
Oh this fucking dog is going
to start barking again.

2545
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:51,470
Somebody shot him up.

2546
01:18:51,471 --> 01:18:52,280
That freaks me out.

2547
01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:53,870
They don't have that internal dialogue.

2548
01:18:54,050 --> 01:18:55,550
So that's why they
don't remember anything.

2549
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:59,270
That's why from the time where
you're like a baby and your newborn,

2550
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:03,260
which you really start remembering
is once you hit like five,

2551
01:19:03,261 --> 01:19:03,831
six,

2552
01:19:03,831 --> 01:19:04,071
seven,

2553
01:19:04,071 --> 01:19:05,780
once you have language in words,

2554
01:19:05,990 --> 01:19:09,320
once you have words that you can recall
and once you have things that you can

2555
01:19:09,620 --> 01:19:10,850
bring up again,

2556
01:19:11,270 --> 01:19:14,930
like my daughter will bring up stuff
that happened to her when she was like

2557
01:19:14,931 --> 01:19:15,770
three or four,

2558
01:19:15,950 --> 01:19:16,200
you know,

2559
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:16,521
she's like,

2560
01:19:16,521 --> 01:19:18,590
remember that time we
saw that thing and all?

2561
01:19:18,591 --> 01:19:19,071
Oh yeah,

2562
01:19:19,071 --> 01:19:19,791
that was pretty cool,

2563
01:19:19,791 --> 01:19:20,031
right?

2564
01:19:20,031 --> 01:19:20,421
Like yeah,

2565
01:19:20,421 --> 01:19:21,254
that was cool.

2566
01:19:21,290 --> 01:19:21,531
I can,

2567
01:19:21,531 --> 01:19:23,780
she's five and she'll talk about
something that happened a year ago,

2568
01:19:23,910 --> 01:19:24,071
but,

2569
01:19:24,071 --> 01:19:27,380
but it's because a year
ago she had language,

2570
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:27,591
you know,

2571
01:19:27,591 --> 01:19:28,790
she could talk a year ago,

2572
01:19:29,060 --> 01:19:31,640
but like she doesn't bring up some
shit that happened when she was one.

2573
01:19:32,090 --> 01:19:32,900
She doesn't remember it.

2574
01:19:32,900 --> 01:19:36,050
So late term abortions til
about two or three I think.

2575
01:19:36,051 --> 01:19:36,884
One,

2576
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:37,751
some kids taught,

2577
01:19:37,751 --> 01:19:37,941
well,

2578
01:19:37,941 --> 01:19:38,660
my daughter,

2579
01:19:38,660 --> 01:19:40,820
the first daughter was
talking really good at one.

2580
01:19:41,270 --> 01:19:43,940
It's weird like some of them
to start speaking really young.

2581
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:45,081
Some of them,

2582
01:19:45,081 --> 01:19:46,590
they speak later and it's,

2583
01:19:46,620 --> 01:19:47,453
it's a,

2584
01:19:48,410 --> 01:19:49,280
it's an interesting thing.

2585
01:19:49,281 --> 01:19:49,881
Like when,

2586
01:19:49,881 --> 01:19:51,680
when is someone officially thinking,

2587
01:19:52,220 --> 01:19:53,300
I think they think that,

2588
01:19:53,540 --> 01:19:54,373
I think it was like,

2589
01:19:54,380 --> 01:19:58,100
the idea is that 48 days after conception,

2590
01:19:58,101 --> 01:20:02,870
the soul enters the body was like
the eastern mysticism view or some,

2591
01:20:03,050 --> 01:20:05,150
some ancient view of like when,

2592
01:20:05,180 --> 01:20:05,431
when,

2593
01:20:05,431 --> 01:20:05,550
uh,

2594
01:20:05,550 --> 01:20:05,840
uh,

2595
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:07,830
of a fetus viable,

2596
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:11,460
when it becomes a person that 48 days,

2597
01:20:11,670 --> 01:20:15,060
up until then it was just a bundle
of soul or a bundle of cells.

2598
01:20:15,220 --> 01:20:18,000
It takes 48 days to install
the operating system.

2599
01:20:18,060 --> 01:20:18,893
Huh?

2600
01:20:19,410 --> 01:20:20,070
No,

2601
01:20:20,070 --> 01:20:21,030
something's happening.

2602
01:20:21,031 --> 01:20:21,241
You know,

2603
01:20:21,241 --> 01:20:21,451
you're,

2604
01:20:21,451 --> 01:20:23,910
you're accumulating so many different,

2605
01:20:24,450 --> 01:20:24,920
you know,

2606
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:25,310
your,

2607
01:20:25,310 --> 01:20:26,550
your brain is growing,

2608
01:20:26,700 --> 01:20:28,470
your cumulating senses.

2609
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:29,460
You're accumulating,

2610
01:20:29,461 --> 01:20:30,810
your ability to perceive,

2611
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:32,100
your eyes are growing,

2612
01:20:32,101 --> 01:20:33,060
they're developing,

2613
01:20:33,090 --> 01:20:35,040
your sensations are
growing and developing.

2614
01:20:35,460 --> 01:20:36,330
It's really weird,

2615
01:20:36,331 --> 01:20:36,990
man.

2616
01:20:36,990 --> 01:20:40,950
I had a dream about a girl that
haven't thought about in a long time.

2617
01:20:40,951 --> 01:20:44,640
I wake up and all I did for
the rest of the day is like,

2618
01:20:44,700 --> 01:20:44,911
oh,

2619
01:20:44,911 --> 01:20:45,870
what's she doing now?

2620
01:20:45,871 --> 01:20:47,010
Why I should talk to her?

2621
01:20:47,011 --> 01:20:49,050
And then I texted her and I'm thinking,

2622
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:53,520
how interesting is that something that I
had no control of while I was dreaming?

2623
01:20:53,521 --> 01:20:56,250
What's making me do
stuff when now is awake?

2624
01:20:56,400 --> 01:21:00,690
And I was thinking how interesting that
you know the whole shutting off when you

2625
01:21:00,691 --> 01:21:01,650
go to bed and your,

2626
01:21:01,651 --> 01:21:03,540
your dad when you know
when you're sleeping,

2627
01:21:03,541 --> 01:21:03,901
you're just,

2628
01:21:03,901 --> 01:21:04,950
you don't know what's going on.

2629
01:21:05,190 --> 01:21:07,980
But having that road affect your awake,

2630
01:21:07,981 --> 01:21:08,330
rural,

2631
01:21:08,330 --> 01:21:09,780
don't you say world world?

2632
01:21:10,220 --> 01:21:10,550
Why?

2633
01:21:10,550 --> 01:21:10,830
What?

2634
01:21:10,830 --> 01:21:11,221
What is it?

2635
01:21:11,221 --> 01:21:12,480
Why do you insist on do it?

2636
01:21:12,510 --> 01:21:12,661
No,

2637
01:21:12,661 --> 01:21:13,140
it's not.

2638
01:21:13,140 --> 01:21:13,973
No it's not.

2639
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:14,221
No.

2640
01:21:14,221 --> 01:21:15,370
Jamie says world too.

2641
01:21:15,590 --> 01:21:17,070
Think retarded that Brian does.

2642
01:21:17,071 --> 01:21:18,270
It's an Ohio thing.

2643
01:21:18,630 --> 01:21:19,360
He's like,

2644
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:21,360
I know where the gas leak occurred.

2645
01:21:21,650 --> 01:21:24,530
I might but say say when
thousands and thousands.

2646
01:21:25,230 --> 01:21:27,500
Everybody says 1050 h on the,

2647
01:21:27,501 --> 01:21:28,380
and you have to say it that way.

2648
01:21:28,740 --> 01:21:29,370
Thousands.

2649
01:21:29,370 --> 01:21:32,180
It is weird though to answer
a question that when you,

2650
01:21:32,240 --> 01:21:33,001
you dream,

2651
01:21:33,001 --> 01:21:35,610
you can dream about somebody and then
when you're awake you can think about that

2652
01:21:35,611 --> 01:21:36,060
person.

2653
01:21:36,060 --> 01:21:38,160
Like I literally like
woke up and was like,

2654
01:21:38,161 --> 01:21:38,431
man,

2655
01:21:38,431 --> 01:21:40,140
I need to find out
what's this girl's like.

2656
01:21:40,141 --> 01:21:41,760
It was almost not,

2657
01:21:42,180 --> 01:21:45,930
I was like being told to do something
almost and it was just because of interest

2658
01:21:45,931 --> 01:21:46,680
for me,

2659
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:50,310
but it was something I had no control if
I didn't want to think of this girl and

2660
01:21:50,670 --> 01:21:50,911
you know,

2661
01:21:50,911 --> 01:21:51,421
but I was just,

2662
01:21:51,421 --> 01:21:53,730
that's just like an example of
something that's happened recently.

2663
01:21:53,730 --> 01:21:57,510
But what other things that you dream
about and you don't even realize you had a

2664
01:21:57,511 --> 01:21:58,141
dream about,

2665
01:21:58,141 --> 01:21:59,130
but during the day you're like,

2666
01:21:59,131 --> 01:21:59,431
you know,

2667
01:21:59,431 --> 01:22:01,230
I might buy some new
shoes and you're like,

2668
01:22:01,290 --> 01:22:01,920
wait,

2669
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:03,420
but you jumped about
shoes the night before.

2670
01:22:03,421 --> 01:22:04,440
You might not even remember,

2671
01:22:04,441 --> 01:22:06,470
but you you dreamt about or shoes,

2672
01:22:06,471 --> 01:22:07,560
just like shoes.

2673
01:22:07,990 --> 01:22:09,870
She doesn't have to be
connected with your dream.

2674
01:22:09,871 --> 01:22:11,100
What's a terrible reverence?

2675
01:22:11,940 --> 01:22:12,670
You know what I'm saying?

2676
01:22:12,670 --> 01:22:12,991
Like,

2677
01:22:12,991 --> 01:22:15,200
like what you're saying
about the girl that is weird,

2678
01:22:15,510 --> 01:22:16,343
that people,

2679
01:22:16,350 --> 01:22:16,700
they get,

2680
01:22:16,700 --> 01:22:20,760
they get contained in your memories and
sometimes it gets contained incorrectly.

2681
01:22:21,090 --> 01:22:24,420
Like why is it about like exes like you?

2682
01:22:24,450 --> 01:22:25,261
Like generally,

2683
01:22:25,261 --> 01:22:26,250
a lot of times people,

2684
01:22:26,290 --> 01:22:28,110
like especially if you had a
good time with that person,

2685
01:22:28,111 --> 01:22:29,430
you only remember the good times.

2686
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:31,170
And then he get with them again,

2687
01:22:31,171 --> 01:22:32,490
like you haven't seen him in forever.

2688
01:22:32,770 --> 01:22:33,770
And he started talking to him and he goes,

2689
01:22:33,870 --> 01:22:34,351
oh,

2690
01:22:34,351 --> 01:22:35,850
I forgot you're fucking negative.

2691
01:22:36,830 --> 01:22:37,830
Tell negative.

2692
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:40,950
And there's still like bitching about
everything and complaining and always

2693
01:22:40,951 --> 01:22:42,810
looking at the downside of things.

2694
01:22:43,230 --> 01:22:44,040
That's uh,

2695
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:45,840
that's something that for whatever reason,

2696
01:22:46,260 --> 01:22:48,480
a absence makes the heart grow fonder.

2697
01:22:48,481 --> 01:22:48,751
You know,

2698
01:22:48,751 --> 01:22:48,961
we,

2699
01:22:48,961 --> 01:22:53,640
we eliminate those poor memories and
only want to think about the good stuff

2700
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:56,040
except when there's police involved.

2701
01:22:56,041 --> 01:22:58,440
I just remember that you have,

2702
01:22:58,760 --> 01:23:01,990
you have been in scenarios that have been
quite a bit more extreme than myself.

2703
01:23:02,020 --> 01:23:06,530
You ever heard of the men
Mandela effect men dollar Andela?

2704
01:23:06,660 --> 01:23:07,570
Like Nelson Mandela?

2705
01:23:07,630 --> 01:23:07,901
No.

2706
01:23:07,901 --> 01:23:08,410
What does that,

2707
01:23:08,410 --> 01:23:09,760
it's a theory that,

2708
01:23:09,820 --> 01:23:10,270
uh,

2709
01:23:10,270 --> 01:23:10,931
it's Mandela,

2710
01:23:10,931 --> 01:23:11,310
by the way,

2711
01:23:11,310 --> 01:23:12,280
Nelson Mandela.

2712
01:23:12,340 --> 01:23:13,173
Mandela.

2713
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:14,433
When a large group,

2714
01:23:15,220 --> 01:23:18,520
a large group of people have a
vivid memory that's all the same,

2715
01:23:18,730 --> 01:23:19,690
but it's false.

2716
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:23,200
Like there's a large group of people
that had a memory of Nelson Mandela dying

2717
01:23:23,201 --> 01:23:24,034
in prison,

2718
01:23:24,130 --> 01:23:27,340
but he obviously didn't
die like the barons teens.

2719
01:23:27,370 --> 01:23:28,630
That's exactly where
I was going with that.

2720
01:23:28,631 --> 01:23:29,860
Like it's come back around.

2721
01:23:29,861 --> 01:23:31,060
I know it's been talked about before,

2722
01:23:31,061 --> 01:23:34,030
but it's come back around recently
and now they're saying that we live in

2723
01:23:34,031 --> 01:23:35,120
parallel roads and stuff.

2724
01:23:35,121 --> 01:23:37,050
What it is just the Shel Silverstein.

2725
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:37,451
I mean,

2726
01:23:37,451 --> 01:23:38,650
I explained that last time,

2727
01:23:38,651 --> 01:23:38,940
you know,

2728
01:23:38,940 --> 01:23:39,100
we,

2729
01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:42,520
Shel Silverstein came out the same time
as Bernstein and everyone thought or

2730
01:23:42,620 --> 01:23:45,400
Berenstain it and everyone just put the
two together thinking it was the same

2731
01:23:45,401 --> 01:23:46,360
Steen and we just,

2732
01:23:46,870 --> 01:23:47,890
it's just a memory.

2733
01:23:47,930 --> 01:23:49,270
It's especially for a word that's,

2734
01:23:49,271 --> 01:23:49,510
that,

2735
01:23:49,510 --> 01:23:50,710
that's an odd word.

2736
01:23:50,950 --> 01:23:52,270
Berenstain is odd.

2737
01:23:52,271 --> 01:23:54,020
But Baron Steen is pretty common.

2738
01:23:54,021 --> 01:23:54,220
Yeah.

2739
01:23:54,220 --> 01:23:56,080
There's deep reddit posts about it now.

2740
01:23:56,081 --> 01:23:59,860
And there's a top theory is that
someone's gone back in time and change.

2741
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:00,970
Exactly.

2742
01:24:00,970 --> 01:24:01,900
Shel Silverstein,

2743
01:24:01,930 --> 01:24:02,291
dude,

2744
01:24:02,291 --> 01:24:03,760
people waste so much time.

2745
01:24:03,761 --> 01:24:07,450
Some fucking dude was tweeting
me yesterday about the flat.

2746
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:08,650
I looked up,

2747
01:24:08,650 --> 01:24:09,590
oh my God,

2748
01:24:09,591 --> 01:24:10,480
this guy is,

2749
01:24:10,490 --> 01:24:11,230
this is,

2750
01:24:11,230 --> 01:24:13,030
I don't normally do this,

2751
01:24:13,270 --> 01:24:13,870
but uh,

2752
01:24:13,870 --> 01:24:15,430
I couldn't help it in this.

2753
01:24:16,010 --> 01:24:16,990
This guy tweets me.

2754
01:24:17,110 --> 01:24:18,100
I was weird at first,

2755
01:24:18,101 --> 01:24:22,540
but Eric Dubay has some
compelling arguments supporting
flat earth that can't be

2756
01:24:22,541 --> 01:24:23,374
explained.

2757
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:26,140
So I tweet back in all caps.

2758
01:24:26,290 --> 01:24:27,790
No he doesn't.

2759
01:24:28,030 --> 01:24:29,410
And then he tweets me.

2760
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:32,560
Have you extensively
looked into his research?

2761
01:24:32,890 --> 01:24:33,723
First of all,

2762
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:38,760
if you're a fucking guy that's making
youtube videos about the earth being flat,

2763
01:24:38,950 --> 01:24:41,050
that Shit isn't research.

2764
01:24:41,140 --> 01:24:42,370
It's just not,

2765
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:43,330
it's not real.

2766
01:24:43,330 --> 01:24:44,350
You're not a scientist.

2767
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:45,550
You're not wearing a lab coat.

2768
01:24:45,640 --> 01:24:49,000
You don't work for a major university
just because you get some fucking jack off

2769
01:24:49,030 --> 01:24:49,900
alone in your room,

2770
01:24:50,020 --> 01:24:51,610
obsessing about nonsense.

2771
01:24:51,790 --> 01:24:54,160
That's not research that said,

2772
01:24:54,490 --> 01:24:56,650
so have you extensively
looked into his research?

2773
01:24:56,770 --> 01:25:00,520
There's definitely some fuckery going
on with most of the ISS footage.

2774
01:25:00,760 --> 01:25:01,001
So,

2775
01:25:01,001 --> 01:25:01,960
which I quote,

2776
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:03,760
I wrote back in all caps.

2777
01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:04,873
Uh,

2778
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:06,070
no he doesn't.

2779
01:25:08,050 --> 01:25:09,100
I know it isn't,

2780
01:25:09,250 --> 01:25:09,671
or no,

2781
01:25:09,671 --> 01:25:10,300
there isn't.

2782
01:25:10,300 --> 01:25:10,481
No,

2783
01:25:10,481 --> 01:25:10,930
there isn't.

2784
01:25:10,930 --> 01:25:11,081
No,

2785
01:25:11,081 --> 01:25:12,220
there isn't a fuckery.

2786
01:25:12,580 --> 01:25:13,380
And then I just,

2787
01:25:13,380 --> 01:25:15,400
I stepped back and just
watch the comments.

2788
01:25:15,401 --> 01:25:17,050
The comments are amazing.

2789
01:25:17,470 --> 01:25:22,470
There are so fucking amazing people
actually arguing for the flat earth people

2790
01:25:22,571 --> 01:25:23,590
arguing against the flap.

2791
01:25:23,710 --> 01:25:24,790
You know who one of them is?

2792
01:25:25,480 --> 01:25:26,390
My Buddy Max.

2793
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:27,313
Happily.

2794
01:25:29,260 --> 01:25:30,670
Did you see it or did you guess?

2795
01:25:30,910 --> 01:25:32,230
I follow him on Facebook.

2796
01:25:33,970 --> 01:25:34,990
I couldn't believe it.

2797
01:25:34,991 --> 01:25:37,030
I saw my friend Justin,

2798
01:25:37,090 --> 01:25:37,450
uh,

2799
01:25:37,450 --> 01:25:38,290
texted me about it.

2800
01:25:38,291 --> 01:25:38,501
He goes,

2801
01:25:38,501 --> 01:25:38,891
dude,

2802
01:25:38,891 --> 01:25:42,040
I shit you not max is arguing
that the earth is flat.

2803
01:25:42,310 --> 01:25:44,950
I called Max's nuts.

2804
01:25:45,010 --> 01:25:45,990
He's so nuts.

2805
01:25:46,660 --> 01:25:47,650
Earth picture thing too.

2806
01:25:48,100 --> 01:25:49,610
There was pictures like that same thing.

2807
01:25:49,611 --> 01:25:49,721
Got,

2808
01:25:49,721 --> 01:25:52,840
he was talking about the other day
about where all the pictures from Earth.

2809
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:54,513
Oh God,

2810
01:25:56,340 --> 01:25:56,800
it hurts.

2811
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:57,340
It hurts.

2812
01:25:57,340 --> 01:25:58,000
It hurts.

2813
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:02,470
Did they not know that snipers actually
have to take into account the curvature

2814
01:26:02,471 --> 01:26:03,950
of the earth when they're shooting people?

2815
01:26:04,340 --> 01:26:05,150
Because the ball,

2816
01:26:05,150 --> 01:26:06,350
the bullets will drop.

2817
01:26:06,590 --> 01:26:09,260
Like there's a curvature of the
earth like you have to theirs.

2818
01:26:09,300 --> 01:26:14,240
That's a part of the calculation when
you're trying to shoot somebody fuckers

2819
01:26:14,570 --> 01:26:14,841
like,

2820
01:26:14,841 --> 01:26:15,710
God dammit,

2821
01:26:15,860 --> 01:26:17,720
there's this shit to think about.

2822
01:26:17,930 --> 01:26:19,370
And then there's that man.

2823
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:20,031
Yeah,

2824
01:26:20,031 --> 01:26:20,600
man.

2825
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:20,811
Well,

2826
01:26:20,811 --> 01:26:24,950
people love to fucking get
worked up about nonsense.

2827
01:26:25,250 --> 01:26:25,491
You know,

2828
01:26:25,491 --> 01:26:26,620
like I,

2829
01:26:27,620 --> 01:26:30,650
I posted about a fucking Cecil the lion

2830
01:26:32,210 --> 01:26:36,950
I posted today about the fucking lion
that killed the guy on the photographic

2831
01:26:36,951 --> 01:26:37,850
safari thing.

2832
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:39,320
So I put this on Facebook,

2833
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:43,280
I go align killed a safari guide in
the same park where Cecil was killed.

2834
01:26:43,490 --> 01:26:46,400
The Safari guy had a name
and was loved by the locals.

2835
01:26:46,640 --> 01:26:50,030
The line was not in all caps
authorized to kill that person.

2836
01:26:50,300 --> 01:26:53,210
I hope to all other lines do
the right thing and protest.

2837
01:26:53,610 --> 01:26:55,220
I'm just fucking around.

2838
01:26:55,430 --> 01:27:00,430
And then I step back and watch the God
damn fights that are going on in the

2839
01:27:01,521 --> 01:27:03,410
comments section where people,

2840
01:27:03,411 --> 01:27:04,460
first of all our thinking,

2841
01:27:04,461 --> 01:27:05,600
I'm an asshole because I,

2842
01:27:05,810 --> 01:27:06,800
I'm serious,

2843
01:27:07,100 --> 01:27:07,341
Joe,

2844
01:27:07,341 --> 01:27:08,690
you're smarter than that.

2845
01:27:08,810 --> 01:27:09,740
You should know.

2846
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:11,481
First of all,

2847
01:27:11,481 --> 01:27:15,920
it reached 1.8 million people in the
two hours we've been doing this podcast.

2848
01:27:16,130 --> 01:27:17,300
How the fuck that happened?

2849
01:27:17,810 --> 01:27:18,411
But uh,

2850
01:27:18,411 --> 01:27:18,831
Joe,

2851
01:27:18,831 --> 01:27:19,581
you're smart.

2852
01:27:19,581 --> 01:27:20,930
We talked in person before.

2853
01:27:21,140 --> 01:27:22,760
Lions are designed to kill,

2854
01:27:22,940 --> 01:27:23,940
they have line breaks.

2855
01:27:23,941 --> 01:27:24,950
We shut the fuck up.

2856
01:27:24,951 --> 01:27:25,670
Stupid.

2857
01:27:25,670 --> 01:27:27,380
You're trying to sell sound smart.

2858
01:27:28,430 --> 01:27:28,731
You think?

2859
01:27:28,731 --> 01:27:30,870
I really think that that
line should have killed them.

2860
01:27:31,250 --> 01:27:32,420
I am glad.

2861
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:33,530
Let me tell you this right now.

2862
01:27:33,650 --> 01:27:37,940
If there's a guy that's on a fucking
photographic safari and align takes him

2863
01:27:37,941 --> 01:27:38,121
out,

2864
01:27:38,121 --> 01:27:39,830
I'm glad you know why?

2865
01:27:40,010 --> 01:27:42,740
Because I've been on the four or
five at four in the afternoon.

2866
01:27:42,890 --> 01:27:44,090
We could use less people.

2867
01:27:44,270 --> 01:27:45,560
We could use less people,

2868
01:27:45,650 --> 01:27:48,650
and anybody that's willing to go
on a fucking photographic safari,

2869
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:50,060
you're an asshole.

2870
01:27:50,240 --> 01:27:51,250
If you want to go on a photos,

2871
01:27:51,320 --> 01:27:53,930
photographic safari in the
place where lions live,

2872
01:27:53,990 --> 01:27:54,950
you ridiculous.

2873
01:27:54,980 --> 01:27:58,700
You've watched too many movies
and for the sake of mankind,

2874
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:01,520
you probably should get taken
out so everybody else could see.

2875
01:28:01,850 --> 01:28:02,810
Oh,

2876
01:28:02,990 --> 01:28:03,291
okay.

2877
01:28:03,291 --> 01:28:04,280
They're just lions.

2878
01:28:04,550 --> 01:28:06,170
These aren't lines that are in a movie.

2879
01:28:06,290 --> 01:28:07,700
These aren't lines from a book.

2880
01:28:07,850 --> 01:28:09,350
These aren't lines from a cartoon.

2881
01:28:09,620 --> 01:28:11,180
There are giant cats,

2882
01:28:11,750 --> 01:28:12,890
big fucking cats.

2883
01:28:13,100 --> 01:28:16,160
I got a little cat at home
and I take little things.

2884
01:28:16,340 --> 01:28:19,160
I crumple up a piece of paypal
and I throw them across the floor.

2885
01:28:19,161 --> 01:28:19,994
She chases him,

2886
01:28:20,210 --> 01:28:24,080
dives on them and puts them in
her mouth and she's a fluff ball.

2887
01:28:24,710 --> 01:28:25,543
She's a cat.

2888
01:28:26,120 --> 01:28:30,740
These are 600 pound cats that
regularly kill shit all day.

2889
01:28:30,741 --> 01:28:31,574
They kill things.

2890
01:28:31,610 --> 01:28:34,550
They're hardwired to kill
anything that's limping,

2891
01:28:34,750 --> 01:28:37,100
anything that's weak and
it's in front of them,

2892
01:28:37,370 --> 01:28:40,640
including some stupid fuck
with a camera walking.

2893
01:28:41,450 --> 01:28:45,050
You should be in an iron man suit and
should be armed to the Dick that you

2894
01:28:45,051 --> 01:28:45,560
should be.

2895
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:47,900
If you're going to walk
around where lions are,

2896
01:28:47,990 --> 01:28:48,823
it should be,

2897
01:28:48,830 --> 01:28:50,270
you should be like mocking them.

2898
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:51,313
You should be in one of those,

2899
01:28:51,560 --> 01:28:52,940
not the regular iron suit,

2900
01:28:52,941 --> 01:28:54,770
but the big one where
the dude's inside of it.

2901
01:28:55,860 --> 01:28:58,460
The big fucking gray one that they had.

2902
01:28:59,050 --> 01:28:59,421
Yeah,

2903
01:28:59,421 --> 01:29:01,470
the whole killer iron man's suit.

2904
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:02,550
That's what you should be in.

2905
01:29:02,610 --> 01:29:03,990
Did you see fantastic for?

2906
01:29:04,260 --> 01:29:05,093
Of course.

2907
01:29:06,070 --> 01:29:07,830
I'm not seeing anything
when they have kids.

2908
01:29:07,970 --> 01:29:08,280
Yeah,

2909
01:29:08,280 --> 01:29:10,920
they redo it and I was
like a young black kid.

2910
01:29:10,921 --> 01:29:11,754
That's the flame.

2911
01:29:11,790 --> 01:29:13,800
Stop with your diversity and okay,

2912
01:29:13,801 --> 01:29:15,510
I saw the fucking comic book.

2913
01:29:15,900 --> 01:29:17,610
You know blade was black.

2914
01:29:17,820 --> 01:29:19,350
The flame was not black.

2915
01:29:19,380 --> 01:29:20,670
You're making them black.

2916
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:21,750
I know what you're doing.

2917
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:22,500
Okay,

2918
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:23,333
stop.

2919
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:25,410
It's like Annie Black,

2920
01:29:25,411 --> 01:29:25,990
Annie,

2921
01:29:25,990 --> 01:29:26,490
Annie.

2922
01:29:26,490 --> 01:29:27,840
It's just make a new one,

2923
01:29:27,841 --> 01:29:28,400
man.

2924
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:30,480
I'm not against black superheroes.

2925
01:29:30,510 --> 01:29:31,320
Make a new one.

2926
01:29:31,320 --> 01:29:32,760
But when you say the Superman's black,

2927
01:29:32,761 --> 01:29:33,000
I'm like,

2928
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:33,720
come on,

2929
01:29:33,720 --> 01:29:34,500
come on.

2930
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:35,333
He's not black.

2931
01:29:35,370 --> 01:29:36,061
Are Not doing that,

2932
01:29:36,061 --> 01:29:36,894
are they?

2933
01:29:36,990 --> 01:29:37,823
They are now.

2934
01:29:38,060 --> 01:29:38,761
Someone was going to,

2935
01:29:38,761 --> 01:29:39,271
yes,

2936
01:29:39,271 --> 01:29:40,104
he should be.

2937
01:29:40,170 --> 01:29:42,750
Do you remember when they
were saying that Santa Claus,

2938
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:46,800
they were doing a black Santa Claus and
Megan Kelly got really mad on Fox TV.

2939
01:29:46,801 --> 01:29:47,520
Do you ever see that?

2940
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:48,353
Oh,

2941
01:29:48,450 --> 01:29:49,283
I remember that.

2942
01:29:49,680 --> 01:29:52,200
People are so mad at
her because she's like,

2943
01:29:52,380 --> 01:29:53,130
she made it.

2944
01:29:53,130 --> 01:29:53,700
She was like,

2945
01:29:53,700 --> 01:29:54,533
there was a video,

2946
01:29:54,790 --> 01:29:58,920
you know on Fox TV where she would
say Santa clause is not black.

2947
01:29:59,040 --> 01:29:59,873
Okay,

2948
01:30:00,030 --> 01:30:01,020
let's just get it over with.

2949
01:30:01,140 --> 01:30:02,670
Santa clause is not black.

2950
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:03,390
No,

2951
01:30:03,390 --> 01:30:04,620
Santa Claus is not real.

2952
01:30:04,621 --> 01:30:05,454
You flog.

2953
01:30:05,460 --> 01:30:05,911
Okay.

2954
01:30:05,911 --> 01:30:07,020
That's the correct thing.

2955
01:30:07,021 --> 01:30:07,854
You should have said.

2956
01:30:07,950 --> 01:30:09,150
Not that he's not black.

2957
01:30:09,151 --> 01:30:09,984
That's hilarious.

2958
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:10,950
Saint Nick,

2959
01:30:10,950 --> 01:30:11,880
but first of all,

2960
01:30:11,910 --> 01:30:12,743
she's right.

2961
01:30:13,140 --> 01:30:14,820
It's not a lot of black people in Siberia,

2962
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:15,870
you know?

2963
01:30:15,870 --> 01:30:16,950
But you know who is black?

2964
01:30:17,070 --> 01:30:18,030
Jesus.

2965
01:30:19,100 --> 01:30:19,881
It makes more sense.

2966
01:30:19,881 --> 01:30:20,160
Yeah.

2967
01:30:20,160 --> 01:30:20,910
He was black.

2968
01:30:20,910 --> 01:30:24,630
It fucking skin of bronze
and hair of wool hit here.

2969
01:30:24,631 --> 01:30:24,841
What?

2970
01:30:24,841 --> 01:30:26,880
Like lamb's wool and the skin was black.

2971
01:30:27,030 --> 01:30:27,960
He was Sephardic.

2972
01:30:27,961 --> 01:30:30,120
He was a dark person for sure.

2973
01:30:30,340 --> 01:30:30,601
It did.

2974
01:30:30,601 --> 01:30:31,830
Definitely didn't look like that hippie.

2975
01:30:32,100 --> 01:30:32,940
Let's let it play it.

2976
01:30:33,150 --> 01:30:33,983
Let's listen to her

2977
01:30:35,270 --> 01:30:35,920
in,

2978
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:36,750
they have a piece,

2979
01:30:36,750 --> 01:30:36,941
uh,

2980
01:30:36,941 --> 01:30:39,820
on.com in Santa clause should
not be a white man anymore.

2981
01:30:40,240 --> 01:30:41,260
And when I saw this headline,

2982
01:30:41,310 --> 01:30:43,300
I kind of laughed and I sound this isn't,

2983
01:30:43,301 --> 01:30:44,200
you're so ridiculous,

2984
01:30:44,210 --> 01:30:47,860
yet another person claiming it's
racist to have a white Santa,

2985
01:30:48,130 --> 01:30:48,730
you know?

2986
01:30:48,730 --> 01:30:49,271
And by the way,

2987
01:30:49,271 --> 01:30:50,560
for all your kids watching at home,

2988
01:30:50,620 --> 01:30:52,030
Santa just is white,

2989
01:30:52,031 --> 01:30:53,560
but this person has just arguing.

2990
01:30:53,561 --> 01:30:54,070
Then net,

2991
01:30:54,070 --> 01:30:55,210
maybe we should,

2992
01:30:55,270 --> 01:30:56,560
we should also have a black son.

2993
01:30:56,561 --> 01:30:58,930
She's lying to your kids what
he is and just so you know,

2994
01:30:58,931 --> 01:31:01,210
we're just debating this because
someone wrote about a kid's.

2995
01:31:01,420 --> 01:31:01,691
Okay,

2996
01:31:01,691 --> 01:31:02,524
why don't you get that?

2997
01:31:03,110 --> 01:31:03,943
She's got like,

2998
01:31:05,870 --> 01:31:07,490
she's giving safe where the kids,

2999
01:31:07,640 --> 01:31:09,350
just in case any kids are listening,

3000
01:31:09,660 --> 01:31:11,300
Santa Claus is white,

3001
01:31:12,170 --> 01:31:13,010
white kids.

3002
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:13,431
Listen,

3003
01:31:13,431 --> 01:31:14,410
Santa Claus is white.

3004
01:31:15,320 --> 01:31:16,153
That's ridiculous.

3005
01:31:16,260 --> 01:31:17,001
Show me a picture.

3006
01:31:17,001 --> 01:31:17,930
How long ago was that?

3007
01:31:17,960 --> 01:31:19,740
Show me a picture of
this fucking Santa Claus.

3008
01:31:19,770 --> 01:31:20,330
He's white

3009
01:31:20,330 --> 01:31:21,163
two years ago.

3010
01:31:21,290 --> 01:31:22,123
Two years ago.

3011
01:31:22,250 --> 01:31:22,700
Wow.

3012
01:31:22,700 --> 01:31:23,331
She's hot though.

3013
01:31:23,331 --> 01:31:23,631
She does.

3014
01:31:23,631 --> 01:31:24,860
Everyone want to save the kids.

3015
01:31:24,920 --> 01:31:27,710
Kids are Kinda smart or at least
they think they are way smarter.

3016
01:31:27,810 --> 01:31:30,330
It is important to save the
kids when it comes to say,

3017
01:31:31,010 --> 01:31:31,431
Jamie,

3018
01:31:31,431 --> 01:31:33,080
you don't know cause you don't have kids.

3019
01:31:33,290 --> 01:31:33,611
I'm like,

3020
01:31:33,611 --> 01:31:35,810
precious little babies need to be lied to.

3021
01:31:36,440 --> 01:31:38,210
They need to be lied to about Santa.

3022
01:31:38,810 --> 01:31:39,260
You can.

3023
01:31:39,260 --> 01:31:40,190
Kelly's going to lie to them.

3024
01:31:40,191 --> 01:31:41,024
Right.

3025
01:31:41,420 --> 01:31:42,470
I know this kid,

3026
01:31:42,490 --> 01:31:42,771
he,

3027
01:31:42,771 --> 01:31:45,060
he gets bullied all the time and he was,

3028
01:31:45,230 --> 01:31:49,760
and I actually got to see the bully bully
on the playground a couple of months

3029
01:31:49,761 --> 01:31:50,120
ago.

3030
01:31:50,120 --> 01:31:50,953
Yeah.

3031
01:31:51,260 --> 01:31:52,100
And uh,

3032
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:53,060
he was,

3033
01:31:53,060 --> 01:31:54,080
and I was telling him like,

3034
01:31:54,081 --> 01:31:54,770
you know,

3035
01:31:54,770 --> 01:31:56,680
you should get him back and I,

3036
01:31:56,840 --> 01:31:57,201
and he goes,

3037
01:31:57,201 --> 01:31:58,040
Hi am I am?

3038
01:31:58,310 --> 01:31:59,020
And uh,

3039
01:31:59,020 --> 01:32:01,330
we made a plan where we Photoshop,

3040
01:32:01,480 --> 01:32:05,920
we found a photo of the his bullae and
we photo shopped him kissing another kid

3041
01:32:05,921 --> 01:32:06,970
that's another bully.

3042
01:32:07,270 --> 01:32:10,090
And then when we printed out a bunch of
them and then put them all around the

3043
01:32:10,150 --> 01:32:10,983
playground,

3044
01:32:14,620 --> 01:32:14,921
right.

3045
01:32:14,921 --> 01:32:16,830
But it's so cool nowadays with like,

3046
01:32:16,860 --> 01:32:18,620
like these kids like he was like,

3047
01:32:20,290 --> 01:32:23,260
when I was 11 I never thought about doing
crazy things like that to get back to

3048
01:32:23,261 --> 01:32:24,820
boy I just hid it or something like that.

3049
01:32:24,821 --> 01:32:28,930
But nowadays kids are so
advanced that even when,

3050
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:30,490
when when dealing with bullies,

3051
01:32:30,491 --> 01:32:31,570
they're using technology.

3052
01:32:31,630 --> 01:32:33,040
I love it to be careful though.

3053
01:32:33,041 --> 01:32:35,890
The kid doesn't find out who did
it and beat the shit out of him.

3054
01:32:36,700 --> 01:32:37,533
Problem.

3055
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:39,633
Yeah man.

3056
01:32:40,300 --> 01:32:43,930
Fucking why is it a natural instinct
for people to do that to little kids?

3057
01:32:44,710 --> 01:32:45,760
It's a natural instinct,

3058
01:32:45,761 --> 01:32:46,051
right?

3059
01:32:46,051 --> 01:32:49,180
Like this is like for those big
kids to pick on little kids,

3060
01:32:49,181 --> 01:32:51,490
it seems like almost
like a natural instinct.

3061
01:32:52,040 --> 01:32:54,970
It's a fucked up instinct
because like if you're bullied,

3062
01:32:55,150 --> 01:32:59,460
like bullying for me led me
into martial arts and it,

3063
01:32:59,490 --> 01:33:04,490
it helped me ultimately like that fear
of people kicking my ass led me to go and

3064
01:33:05,290 --> 01:33:06,730
train and do martial arts.

3065
01:33:07,270 --> 01:33:11,020
But for some people they don't do
anything about it and they have like a

3066
01:33:11,021 --> 01:33:12,210
particularly evil bull.

3067
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:14,830
I got my bullying was very gentle,

3068
01:33:14,980 --> 01:33:17,860
nothing bad happened and
nobody put me in the hospital.

3069
01:33:18,010 --> 01:33:21,070
Nobody stole things from
me or terrorized me.

3070
01:33:21,220 --> 01:33:24,430
I just was scared to certain kids and
certain kids fuck with me and I avoided

3071
01:33:24,431 --> 01:33:25,090
them.

3072
01:33:25,090 --> 01:33:27,460
Like I'd see them in the hallway
and a gold the other way.

3073
01:33:27,460 --> 01:33:31,240
I'd try to find another way to get to
the bus in order to go away all the way

3074
01:33:31,241 --> 01:33:33,250
around and look around the corner,

3075
01:33:33,251 --> 01:33:34,570
make sure that certain kid that was,

3076
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:35,920
that I was scared of wasn't there,

3077
01:33:36,220 --> 01:33:38,950
but it was fairly mild
as far as bullying goes.

3078
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:42,970
But we all know somebody who's
like beaten up by bullies.

3079
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:45,100
That chick can change your life,

3080
01:33:45,101 --> 01:33:45,640
man.

3081
01:33:45,640 --> 01:33:47,140
It could devastate your confidence.

3082
01:33:47,141 --> 01:33:48,520
It could ruin your whole year.

3083
01:33:48,730 --> 01:33:49,980
It could lead to depression,

3084
01:33:49,990 --> 01:33:52,270
it could lead to a drug use like,

3085
01:33:52,360 --> 01:33:56,290
and I don't know what the fuck can be
done for that other than I've always

3086
01:33:56,291 --> 01:34:01,291
suggested that teaching kids martial
arts and school would be a great way to

3087
01:34:01,751 --> 01:34:06,751
avoid bullies because avoid bullying
because they would develop confidence and

3088
01:34:06,851 --> 01:34:10,090
they would develop discipline
and they would understand that.

3089
01:34:10,120 --> 01:34:11,740
That kind of shit is pathetic.

3090
01:34:11,770 --> 01:34:15,640
That running around and beating on kids
like this kid that you're talking about,

3091
01:34:15,880 --> 01:34:19,300
they actually not only do in
the 19 martial arts in school,

3092
01:34:19,301 --> 01:34:23,770
they actually did the opposite of
doing things like kickball or games,

3093
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:24,530
uh,

3094
01:34:24,530 --> 01:34:27,580
where they're actually
kind of promoting bullying.

3095
01:34:27,581 --> 01:34:28,570
What's the one where you,

3096
01:34:28,571 --> 01:34:29,970
we all had the lineup on the ball,

3097
01:34:30,010 --> 01:34:30,610
dodge ball.

3098
01:34:30,610 --> 01:34:31,091
It's like great,

3099
01:34:31,091 --> 01:34:32,200
you're teaching dodge ball,

3100
01:34:32,201 --> 01:34:33,550
which is hurting other people,

3101
01:34:33,551 --> 01:34:37,510
but instead we could have
learned karate or whatever stuff.

3102
01:34:37,530 --> 01:34:42,530
Fucking avoid dodge ball like the plague
because I was in when I was 14 was the

3103
01:34:43,421 --> 01:34:44,680
only time I remember dodge ball.

3104
01:34:44,681 --> 01:34:44,860
Well,

3105
01:34:44,860 --> 01:34:46,110
but this is like before I started,

3106
01:34:46,120 --> 01:34:49,180
marshal was kind of just
starting karate and uh,

3107
01:34:49,300 --> 01:34:51,670
I was scared of everybody beat my ass.

3108
01:34:51,930 --> 01:34:52,171
You know,

3109
01:34:52,171 --> 01:34:52,380
there's,

3110
01:34:52,380 --> 01:34:52,661
I didn't,

3111
01:34:52,661 --> 01:34:53,980
it was new in this neighborhood,

3112
01:34:54,280 --> 01:34:55,031
just moved there.

3113
01:34:55,031 --> 01:34:58,490
It was my first year in this neighborhood
as a freshman in high school.

3114
01:34:58,790 --> 01:35:02,990
And then there's just fucking kids that
were lighting kids up with these balls,

3115
01:35:02,991 --> 01:35:03,710
man.

3116
01:35:03,710 --> 01:35:08,270
Just fucking whipping these balls at
kids and they'd get hit in the face and

3117
01:35:08,271 --> 01:35:09,290
everybody would laugh.

3118
01:35:09,291 --> 01:35:09,880
And I'm like,

3119
01:35:09,880 --> 01:35:11,480
this is crazy.

3120
01:35:11,810 --> 01:35:12,471
Dodge balls.

3121
01:35:12,471 --> 01:35:13,460
Fucking crazy.

3122
01:35:13,540 --> 01:35:14,830
And choosing partners.

3123
01:35:14,831 --> 01:35:15,820
Remember you had to choose.

3124
01:35:15,850 --> 01:35:16,683
We are the lineup.

3125
01:35:16,930 --> 01:35:18,040
I Want Jeff on my team.

3126
01:35:18,041 --> 01:35:21,190
I went and taught at my team and then
just having to go through being cherry

3127
01:35:21,220 --> 01:35:25,720
picked the last you remember that there's
so much fucked up shit that they go,

3128
01:35:25,870 --> 01:35:30,340
they do to you as a young kid that you
don't realize that it's teaching you like

3129
01:35:30,640 --> 01:35:31,720
is your place in life.

3130
01:35:31,750 --> 01:35:31,960
Yeah.

3131
01:35:31,960 --> 01:35:32,920
Like your first place,

3132
01:35:32,921 --> 01:35:33,760
your second place.

3133
01:35:33,761 --> 01:35:35,500
Sorry you came in last place.

3134
01:35:35,590 --> 01:35:37,090
Now we're going to throw a ball at you.

3135
01:35:38,450 --> 01:35:39,250
Come Gladwell.

3136
01:35:39,250 --> 01:35:41,250
He's got a book called out about um,

3137
01:35:41,320 --> 01:35:44,410
outliers about people that
perform really well and things.

3138
01:35:44,740 --> 01:35:49,740
And one of the things that he brought
up in this book was how important being

3139
01:35:49,811 --> 01:35:54,811
successful is being born and a
certain date at a certain time.

3140
01:35:55,480 --> 01:35:57,220
A certain time of the year.

3141
01:35:57,370 --> 01:35:59,650
Because if you're born at
a certain time in the year,

3142
01:35:59,800 --> 01:36:03,760
you missed the cutoff and you're older
than the other kids in your class.

3143
01:36:04,120 --> 01:36:08,590
And so like they were talking about like
hockey players and that something about

3144
01:36:08,591 --> 01:36:09,424
like there's like you know,

3145
01:36:09,430 --> 01:36:10,510
x amount of players,

3146
01:36:10,750 --> 01:36:14,170
a huge percentage of them were born later,

3147
01:36:14,500 --> 01:36:16,300
like a rule or something.

3148
01:36:16,310 --> 01:36:17,021
I think in Canada,

3149
01:36:17,021 --> 01:36:20,830
like if you're born on January 1st and
December 31st you're playing with this

3150
01:36:20,831 --> 01:36:24,280
group or that group and you could be the
oldest kid or you could be the youngest

3151
01:36:24,281 --> 01:36:28,090
kid actually if you're born on the 31st
all your friends of the day after you in

3152
01:36:28,091 --> 01:36:28,720
another league.

3153
01:36:28,720 --> 01:36:28,991
Yeah.

3154
01:36:28,991 --> 01:36:32,770
So if you're one of those kids that's
like nine months younger than the other

3155
01:36:32,771 --> 01:36:33,351
kids that are the,

3156
01:36:33,351 --> 01:36:33,581
you know,

3157
01:36:33,581 --> 01:36:34,810
they're all 12 right?

3158
01:36:34,811 --> 01:36:37,750
But one kid is like nine
months older or 10 months old.

3159
01:36:37,990 --> 01:36:39,880
That's fucking significant.

3160
01:36:40,240 --> 01:36:42,280
Really significant when
it comes to sports.

3161
01:36:42,490 --> 01:36:44,110
And his theory is,

3162
01:36:44,320 --> 01:36:45,090
and it's,

3163
01:36:45,090 --> 01:36:50,090
it's really correct that the advantage
that those kids have by being older leads

3164
01:36:50,861 --> 01:36:52,900
them to get better as well.

3165
01:36:53,050 --> 01:36:54,730
Like one of the things about Jujitsu,

3166
01:36:55,060 --> 01:36:58,540
this is a very important lesson for
anybody who knows Jujitsu because a lot of

3167
01:36:58,541 --> 01:37:00,850
people don't like this aspect of Jujitsu.

3168
01:37:01,240 --> 01:37:05,620
Some people have this meathead idea that
the way to get good at Jujitsu is to go

3169
01:37:05,621 --> 01:37:07,000
against the hardest guys.

3170
01:37:07,060 --> 01:37:08,200
Get your ass kicked.

3171
01:37:08,201 --> 01:37:09,040
And that's how you learn.

3172
01:37:09,280 --> 01:37:09,731
Actually.

3173
01:37:09,731 --> 01:37:10,990
That's the wrong way to learn.

3174
01:37:11,230 --> 01:37:14,320
The best way to get good at
Jujitsu is to strangled blue belts.

3175
01:37:15,010 --> 01:37:17,230
You go and you find people
that are just learning,

3176
01:37:17,231 --> 01:37:19,840
but they're not as good as you and
he choked the fuck out of them.

3177
01:37:20,230 --> 01:37:22,060
That's how you get really
good at your technique.

3178
01:37:22,300 --> 01:37:22,841
And people say,

3179
01:37:22,841 --> 01:37:22,961
well,

3180
01:37:22,961 --> 01:37:23,794
that's bullying.

3181
01:37:23,980 --> 01:37:24,813
Well,

3182
01:37:25,090 --> 01:37:27,310
it is important for the blue belt too.

3183
01:37:27,640 --> 01:37:28,630
At some point,

3184
01:37:28,750 --> 01:37:29,920
spar with black belts,

3185
01:37:29,950 --> 01:37:31,770
it is important because when the board,

3186
01:37:31,771 --> 01:37:34,720
purple belts are blump brown belts
because you need to know that there's a

3187
01:37:34,721 --> 01:37:36,880
higher level of proficiency,

3188
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:38,620
there's a higher level of skill,

3189
01:37:38,710 --> 01:37:43,000
and then there's a shorter distance
in between points that these guys are

3190
01:37:43,001 --> 01:37:43,600
hitting.

3191
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:44,110
They're there,

3192
01:37:44,110 --> 01:37:45,880
they're cutting the chase,

3193
01:37:45,881 --> 01:37:46,691
they're getting there,

3194
01:37:46,691 --> 01:37:51,640
they're capitalizing on very small
openings and they they clamp down and when

3195
01:37:51,641 --> 01:37:53,290
they capitalize on these small openings,

3196
01:37:53,430 --> 01:37:53,680
they,

3197
01:37:53,680 --> 01:37:54,970
they get submissions quicker.

3198
01:37:55,170 --> 01:37:57,690
So you have to know that there
are guys that are better.

3199
01:37:57,850 --> 01:37:58,621
That's important.

3200
01:37:58,621 --> 01:38:00,030
But to drill,

3201
01:38:00,420 --> 01:38:02,130
the most important thing is drilling.

3202
01:38:02,280 --> 01:38:03,270
And when you drill,

3203
01:38:03,390 --> 01:38:06,870
you drill with like someone of your
level and you just practice on each other

3204
01:38:06,871 --> 01:38:08,550
like you choked me and you know,

3205
01:38:08,551 --> 01:38:10,320
you'll do it like twice
and I'll choke you.

3206
01:38:10,321 --> 01:38:11,070
I'll do it twice.

3207
01:38:11,070 --> 01:38:12,090
And it's just practice.

3208
01:38:12,180 --> 01:38:17,010
And maybe you'll resist like 50% like
sometimes like when you're doing a drill,

3209
01:38:17,011 --> 01:38:19,650
and I'll pretend to be resisting
resisting a little bit.

3210
01:38:19,651 --> 01:38:20,940
So the strangle me and chuck,

3211
01:38:21,120 --> 01:38:25,500
because that simulates real life
simulates how it would be in,

3212
01:38:25,501 --> 01:38:25,950
in,

3213
01:38:25,950 --> 01:38:28,020
you're supposed to be
building your muscle memory.

3214
01:38:28,290 --> 01:38:29,790
But the real way to do it,

3215
01:38:29,910 --> 01:38:33,690
the after you do that to get it really
sharp is to practice on people with a

3216
01:38:33,691 --> 01:38:36,750
limited amount of proficiency
just to choke the shit out of him.

3217
01:38:36,990 --> 01:38:41,850
So that's like the way that you ultimately
get better is to practice on people

3218
01:38:41,851 --> 01:38:43,470
that aren't quite as good as you.

3219
01:38:43,800 --> 01:38:46,370
And then you eventually develop and the,

3220
01:38:46,430 --> 01:38:48,030
you get to a point where,

3221
01:38:48,060 --> 01:38:48,331
you know,

3222
01:38:48,331 --> 01:38:49,950
that seems kind of impractical,

3223
01:38:50,010 --> 01:38:50,843
you know,

3224
01:38:51,480 --> 01:38:53,790
but I don't remember what my point was.

3225
01:38:54,840 --> 01:38:57,960
I'm choking people,

3226
01:38:58,260 --> 01:39:01,020
sports going against different belts.

3227
01:39:01,080 --> 01:39:02,760
A kid teaching bullying.

3228
01:39:02,850 --> 01:39:03,260
Oh,

3229
01:39:03,260 --> 01:39:03,540
uh,

3230
01:39:03,540 --> 01:39:04,373
getting better.

3231
01:39:04,380 --> 01:39:05,031
So the,

3232
01:39:05,031 --> 01:39:05,251
the,

3233
01:39:05,251 --> 01:39:06,990
the idea by that is,

3234
01:39:06,991 --> 01:39:11,550
the real problem with that is if you're
in a school and say you're the only

3235
01:39:11,551 --> 01:39:15,480
white belts and everybody else is a
brown belt or a black belt and you're

3236
01:39:15,481 --> 01:39:16,314
training with them,

3237
01:39:16,410 --> 01:39:17,400
fuck man,

3238
01:39:17,460 --> 01:39:19,200
you might not ever get good.

3239
01:39:19,410 --> 01:39:21,900
Like you just might get
wrecked all the time.

3240
01:39:22,050 --> 01:39:26,520
And that's the idea with kids that are
in sports that are so much younger than

3241
01:39:26,521 --> 01:39:27,690
everyone else in their class.

3242
01:39:27,780 --> 01:39:31,230
Or if you're pretentious and they
bring your precocious and you,

3243
01:39:31,231 --> 01:39:32,460
they bring you in a class earlier,

3244
01:39:32,580 --> 01:39:33,630
he skipped a grade.

3245
01:39:33,750 --> 01:39:35,010
So you're in seventh grade now,

3246
01:39:35,011 --> 01:39:35,490
Billy.

3247
01:39:35,490 --> 01:39:35,671
Well,

3248
01:39:35,671 --> 01:39:37,200
you got to go to seventh grade football.

3249
01:39:37,410 --> 01:39:38,070
Good luck.

3250
01:39:38,070 --> 01:39:38,910
You little fuck.

3251
01:39:39,300 --> 01:39:40,320
You're going to get run over.

3252
01:39:40,370 --> 01:39:43,590
What am I to one of my best friends
growing up the whole time we were playing

3253
01:39:43,591 --> 01:39:44,424
sports,

3254
01:39:44,490 --> 01:39:45,060
uh,

3255
01:39:45,060 --> 01:39:46,710
his birthday's a week after mine,

3256
01:39:47,130 --> 01:39:48,660
but he's a whole year older than me.

3257
01:39:48,990 --> 01:39:50,700
And so he played sports
with us the whole time.

3258
01:39:50,701 --> 01:39:54,120
He's smaller than me and doesn't
look like he's bigger than all of us,

3259
01:39:54,121 --> 01:39:56,310
but he would beat the shit
out of every single person.

3260
01:39:56,311 --> 01:39:58,230
We would play every sport,

3261
01:39:58,231 --> 01:39:58,621
football,

3262
01:39:58,621 --> 01:39:59,221
basketball,

3263
01:39:59,221 --> 01:39:59,851
baseball,

3264
01:39:59,851 --> 01:40:00,684
track.

3265
01:40:00,780 --> 01:40:01,280
When we were,

3266
01:40:01,280 --> 01:40:02,310
when we got the high school,

3267
01:40:02,850 --> 01:40:05,100
for some reason he was better
than everyone in that too.

3268
01:40:05,101 --> 01:40:08,160
He was a ninth grader and he was starting
freshman running back on the Varsity

3269
01:40:08,161 --> 01:40:10,960
team and the newspaper getting a,

3270
01:40:11,200 --> 01:40:13,530
but he was a whole year
older than everyone and ah,

3271
01:40:13,560 --> 01:40:14,460
well that's what it is.

3272
01:40:14,461 --> 01:40:15,090
15 years ago.

3273
01:40:15,090 --> 01:40:15,870
No one was really,

3274
01:40:15,870 --> 01:40:16,141
yeah.

3275
01:40:16,141 --> 01:40:16,550
Well that's,

3276
01:40:16,550 --> 01:40:18,330
that's a big deal because your,

3277
01:40:18,360 --> 01:40:22,500
your body develops like
very rapidly at a young age.

3278
01:40:22,530 --> 01:40:26,580
And so these young kids that are older
than everyone else in their class,

3279
01:40:26,581 --> 01:40:30,720
they have this significant advantage and
that advantage according to Gladwell,

3280
01:40:30,860 --> 01:40:35,860
it accelerates them onto success as a
professional that because you have an

3281
01:40:36,211 --> 01:40:36,811
advantage,

3282
01:40:36,811 --> 01:40:40,200
you continue to get better and you
can exercise that advantage over other

3283
01:40:40,201 --> 01:40:40,411
people,

3284
01:40:40,411 --> 01:40:41,550
which sharpens your skills.

3285
01:40:41,970 --> 01:40:42,600
Just like,

3286
01:40:42,600 --> 01:40:42,931
you know,

3287
01:40:42,931 --> 01:40:43,980
the idea of taking,

3288
01:40:44,010 --> 01:40:44,250
you know,

3289
01:40:44,250 --> 01:40:46,860
getting really good because
you're strangling blue belts.

3290
01:40:46,890 --> 01:40:47,940
Not good for the blue belt,

3291
01:40:48,150 --> 01:40:49,110
but it's good for you.

3292
01:40:49,410 --> 01:40:49,681
You know,

3293
01:40:49,681 --> 01:40:52,020
cause you're already ahead of them so
you're going to get better and better and

3294
01:40:52,021 --> 01:40:52,740
better and better.

3295
01:40:52,740 --> 01:40:56,650
I always back in third grade when my
parents got divorced and I was a little

3296
01:40:56,651 --> 01:40:57,940
young and uh,

3297
01:40:58,030 --> 01:40:59,020
it didn't help me at all,

3298
01:40:59,640 --> 01:41:00,760
but she didn't try.

3299
01:41:03,220 --> 01:41:04,120
He didn't even try.

3300
01:41:04,121 --> 01:41:04,781
Like what sports,

3301
01:41:04,781 --> 01:41:05,680
did you ever play soccer?

3302
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:06,820
Did you play soccer?

3303
01:41:07,120 --> 01:41:08,800
How much did you try on a one to 10?

3304
01:41:09,270 --> 01:41:09,580
Three.

3305
01:41:09,580 --> 01:41:10,181
I hated it.

3306
01:41:10,181 --> 01:41:10,780
I don't remember.

3307
01:41:10,780 --> 01:41:11,613
Yeah,

3308
01:41:11,770 --> 01:41:12,640
that's a difference.

3309
01:41:13,120 --> 01:41:13,570
Um,

3310
01:41:13,570 --> 01:41:15,160
I was born in August.

3311
01:41:15,190 --> 01:41:16,360
I don't know if that's a good,

3312
01:41:16,480 --> 01:41:18,550
I don't think that's a good
month for professional sports.

3313
01:41:18,910 --> 01:41:20,770
Like if you wanted to go on teams,

3314
01:41:21,040 --> 01:41:21,970
but I didn't do it.

3315
01:41:22,270 --> 01:41:22,481
I mean,

3316
01:41:22,481 --> 01:41:25,840
I only played baseball when I was
little until I found martial arts.

3317
01:41:26,440 --> 01:41:26,821
But if,

3318
01:41:26,821 --> 01:41:27,220
uh,

3319
01:41:27,220 --> 01:41:29,140
I wanted to be a professional athlete,

3320
01:41:29,141 --> 01:41:31,450
like a soccer player or a
hockey player or whatever,

3321
01:41:31,930 --> 01:41:32,830
probably not a good month.

3322
01:41:32,860 --> 01:41:35,350
I think the the good months or like
February or something like that,

3323
01:41:35,950 --> 01:41:36,431
February,

3324
01:41:36,431 --> 01:41:38,250
March and the season starts usually like,

3325
01:41:38,290 --> 01:41:40,330
well you're also like
wait late in the year.

3326
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:42,760
You know though I don't,

3327
01:41:43,030 --> 01:41:44,140
I forget what they said,

3328
01:41:44,141 --> 01:41:44,980
what year it was,

3329
01:41:44,981 --> 01:41:45,091
what,

3330
01:41:45,091 --> 01:41:46,030
what Gladwell said,

3331
01:41:46,031 --> 01:41:49,090
what year was the or what the time
of year rather was the best to start.

3332
01:41:49,240 --> 01:41:50,290
Who is an interesting thing too.

3333
01:41:50,291 --> 01:41:55,291
He had a thing talking about what the
best year to be born was like in the 20th

3334
01:41:56,861 --> 01:42:01,360
century and it was like in the early
1930s cause it was right after the

3335
01:42:01,390 --> 01:42:02,740
depression was over.

3336
01:42:03,130 --> 01:42:05,260
And like right after World War One.

3337
01:42:05,590 --> 01:42:08,290
So like there was a lot of jobs to be had.

3338
01:42:08,291 --> 01:42:13,291
The economy was booming and then you were
at the front of the line for like this

3339
01:42:13,691 --> 01:42:17,590
big baby boom that came on
after that before World War Two.

3340
01:42:17,591 --> 01:42:19,540
So you would be in
positions of management,

3341
01:42:19,560 --> 01:42:20,740
you would have these advantages.

3342
01:42:21,100 --> 01:42:25,930
It's really interesting when you think
about like how lucky you can be or how

3343
01:42:25,990 --> 01:42:30,990
unlucky you can be in certain situations
and how that like we're talking about

3344
01:42:31,121 --> 01:42:33,940
bullying can sort of
flavor your whole life.

3345
01:42:34,180 --> 01:42:39,180
I can unlucky roll of the dice can
flavor your whole life and also he was

3346
01:42:39,761 --> 01:42:44,530
talking about people that were born and
that went through world war one and he

3347
01:42:44,531 --> 01:42:44,771
was like,

3348
01:42:44,771 --> 01:42:47,290
well even if you went through it by
the time you were out of the military,

3349
01:42:47,470 --> 01:42:48,910
by the time you're trying
to establish your life,

3350
01:42:48,911 --> 01:42:50,860
you already in your forties like you are.

3351
01:42:50,860 --> 01:42:54,760
You already like trying to start a
career at the time where most people are

3352
01:42:54,761 --> 01:42:56,200
already clearly established.

3353
01:42:56,440 --> 01:43:00,130
Really interesting when he really stopped
and think about like most of us don't

3354
01:43:00,131 --> 01:43:01,240
engineer our lives.

3355
01:43:01,241 --> 01:43:03,090
You sort of just make the
best with what you're,

3356
01:43:03,180 --> 01:43:04,013
you've got,

3357
01:43:04,180 --> 01:43:06,610
but there's a lot of consequences.

3358
01:43:06,730 --> 01:43:11,380
There's a lot of factors that play on
behind the scenes that we really don't

3359
01:43:11,381 --> 01:43:12,370
take into consideration.

3360
01:43:12,371 --> 01:43:13,204
When you consider,

3361
01:43:13,360 --> 01:43:15,640
when you really think about
like where you are in life,

3362
01:43:16,510 --> 01:43:19,270
I mean hard work and dedication and focus,

3363
01:43:19,271 --> 01:43:20,890
all those things are hugely important.

3364
01:43:21,250 --> 01:43:21,930
Um,

3365
01:43:21,930 --> 01:43:22,230
the,

3366
01:43:22,230 --> 01:43:23,890
the ability to stick with something,

3367
01:43:23,891 --> 01:43:26,500
the ability to put in the
work to get up disciplined,

3368
01:43:27,070 --> 01:43:30,670
but also there's a lot of shit that you
don't have anything to do with man that

3369
01:43:30,671 --> 01:43:32,140
absolutely factors in.

3370
01:43:33,520 --> 01:43:36,010
But then there's that bitch
as part of people that go,

3371
01:43:36,011 --> 01:43:36,270
well,

3372
01:43:36,270 --> 01:43:37,103
he was the only fucking,

3373
01:43:37,770 --> 01:43:39,010
you'd go up there because look,

3374
01:43:39,011 --> 01:43:39,550
he,

3375
01:43:39,550 --> 01:43:39,821
you know,

3376
01:43:39,821 --> 01:43:42,940
he's only playing football for the
fuck of Dodgers are the Dodgers.

3377
01:43:44,590 --> 01:43:48,040
He talks about Bill Gates and his
10,000 hours of mastery and whatnot.

3378
01:43:48,310 --> 01:43:51,190
But a lot of what he's talking
about here is that he got lucky,

3379
01:43:51,260 --> 01:43:52,010
whatnot because his

3380
01:43:52,010 --> 01:43:54,860
childhood home was really close
to the University of Washington,

3381
01:43:55,200 --> 01:43:59,240
get access to some computer programs
that other people might not have had the

3382
01:43:59,241 --> 01:44:00,470
opportunity to get ahold of.

3383
01:44:00,471 --> 01:44:01,160
True.

3384
01:44:01,160 --> 01:44:04,340
So he might not have been Bill
Gates without being in the spot.

3385
01:44:04,341 --> 01:44:05,480
He was at the time he was

3386
01:44:05,610 --> 01:44:05,970
true.

3387
01:44:05,970 --> 01:44:07,440
But he might've been something else too.

3388
01:44:07,470 --> 01:44:09,030
I mean it's also what he did.

3389
01:44:09,240 --> 01:44:11,910
Like Bill Gates used to work from like
two o'clock in the morning until four

3390
01:44:11,911 --> 01:44:14,100
o'clock in the morning until six
o'clock in the morning coding.

3391
01:44:14,380 --> 01:44:16,350
His mother would try to wake him
up and he was always exhausted.

3392
01:44:16,351 --> 01:44:18,960
She couldn't figure out why because
the dude was up all night coding,

3393
01:44:19,800 --> 01:44:22,500
just having to work while she would put
them to bed and even like pretend to

3394
01:44:22,501 --> 01:44:22,830
sleep.

3395
01:44:22,830 --> 01:44:23,663
Then he'd wake up,

3396
01:44:23,670 --> 01:44:25,980
he'd sleep for a couple of
hours and then get up and code.

3397
01:44:26,430 --> 01:44:31,140
And I think that the people that
become successful for the most part,

3398
01:44:31,290 --> 01:44:33,840
they become successful
because they figure out a way.

3399
01:44:34,080 --> 01:44:36,090
But would they have
figured out the same way?

3400
01:44:36,590 --> 01:44:38,670
Would they have figured it out in
another way or would they have been

3401
01:44:38,671 --> 01:44:41,100
discouraged because of poor circumstances?

3402
01:44:41,550 --> 01:44:46,260
You know how many people who became
successful guts like take me for example.

3403
01:44:46,590 --> 01:44:50,340
I'm not maybe with standup because standup
is like something you either just can

3404
01:44:50,341 --> 01:44:54,900
do or you can't do and you have to put
in the work and I don't see any easy

3405
01:44:54,901 --> 01:44:55,840
roads for stand up.

3406
01:44:55,890 --> 01:44:59,280
If you get good at stand up and your
headline and in killing you put in the

3407
01:44:59,281 --> 01:44:59,730
work.

3408
01:44:59,730 --> 01:45:01,140
There's just no other way around it.

3409
01:45:01,410 --> 01:45:03,210
But it's TV wise,

3410
01:45:03,330 --> 01:45:04,710
I got lucky as fuck.

3411
01:45:04,890 --> 01:45:08,440
I only auditioned for two TV
shows ever and I got both of them.

3412
01:45:08,441 --> 01:45:09,151
It's crazy.

3413
01:45:09,151 --> 01:45:10,920
Total dumb luck.

3414
01:45:11,130 --> 01:45:15,150
Got on MTV half hour comedy
hour because of stand up.

3415
01:45:15,420 --> 01:45:16,800
Then I got a development deal.

3416
01:45:16,980 --> 01:45:19,720
The development deal led me
out the Hollywood where I um,

3417
01:45:19,830 --> 01:45:23,880
they Disney Disney gave me a bunch
of money and I auditioned for a show.

3418
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:25,890
Just got total dumb luck.

3419
01:45:26,170 --> 01:45:29,580
They were looking for some athletic
guy to be in this baseball show.

3420
01:45:29,610 --> 01:45:30,443
Got that.

3421
01:45:30,660 --> 01:45:32,280
Then audition for news radio.

3422
01:45:32,280 --> 01:45:33,930
Got that two shows,

3423
01:45:34,200 --> 01:45:36,270
both of them onto just total luck.

3424
01:45:36,390 --> 01:45:38,640
Unquestionably lucky as fuck.

3425
01:45:38,980 --> 01:45:40,080
And then even fear factor.

3426
01:45:40,081 --> 01:45:40,980
Lucky as fuck.

3427
01:45:41,220 --> 01:45:43,080
They wanted someone who
had already been on TV,

3428
01:45:43,081 --> 01:45:45,960
they wanted someone who
understood competition and
they wanted someone who was

3429
01:45:45,961 --> 01:45:48,390
like a comedian that could
like work on the fly.

3430
01:45:48,450 --> 01:45:49,283
Look,

3431
01:45:49,410 --> 01:45:50,243
here I am.

3432
01:45:50,340 --> 01:45:51,173
Dumb luck.

3433
01:45:51,420 --> 01:45:55,350
So those things I will
never a total dumb luck.

3434
01:45:55,590 --> 01:45:59,280
But also you got to fucking show up.

3435
01:45:59,340 --> 01:46:00,780
You got to do the audition,

3436
01:46:00,930 --> 01:46:02,250
you got to not choke.

3437
01:46:02,400 --> 01:46:04,560
Like there's non luck factors as well.

3438
01:46:04,770 --> 01:46:08,190
Like there's certainly luck
involved in everything that happens,

3439
01:46:08,670 --> 01:46:11,310
but there's a lot of other people that
were trying to offer that same show that

3440
01:46:11,311 --> 01:46:13,380
were probably just as qualified as me,

3441
01:46:13,590 --> 01:46:14,700
especially with the first show.

3442
01:46:15,030 --> 01:46:17,220
And they didn't get it
cause they probably choked.

3443
01:46:17,430 --> 01:46:22,200
Maybe my luck was that I had gone through
martial arts competition so I was less

3444
01:46:22,201 --> 01:46:24,660
likely to choke because
I had done scarier shit.

3445
01:46:24,661 --> 01:46:26,160
So I was used to
performing under pressure.

3446
01:46:26,370 --> 01:46:29,790
So maybe there was luck in that luck
in the fact that I had this background.

3447
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:34,260
But that's not necessarily luck either
cause that was fucking hard to do.

3448
01:46:34,590 --> 01:46:38,880
So it's like this black and white
thing that people want to put into.

3449
01:46:38,910 --> 01:46:42,210
You know when you look at like this
guy succeeded because of hard work.

3450
01:46:42,900 --> 01:46:44,010
Well maybe,

3451
01:46:44,011 --> 01:46:47,850
maybe he succeeded because of hard work
and what time of the year he was born

3452
01:46:47,880 --> 01:46:50,280
and that he was older than
the other kids in his class

3453
01:46:50,310 --> 01:46:52,380
and he worked hard and he got there.

3454
01:46:52,710 --> 01:46:54,060
There's a lot of factors.

3455
01:46:55,650 --> 01:46:58,170
There's a lot of fucking
factors in everybody's success.

3456
01:46:59,060 --> 01:47:02,120
There's a new drone Bretta type at Sony,

3457
01:47:02,190 --> 01:47:02,750
uh,

3458
01:47:02,750 --> 01:47:04,970
just released and it can go,

3459
01:47:05,350 --> 01:47:05,900
uh,

3460
01:47:05,900 --> 01:47:06,591
up to,

3461
01:47:06,591 --> 01:47:07,130
uh,

3462
01:47:07,130 --> 01:47:11,560
it can carry up to 22 pounds of
cargo and it can go up to a hundred,

3463
01:47:11,570 --> 01:47:12,920
six miles an hour,

3464
01:47:13,450 --> 01:47:14,283
uh,

3465
01:47:14,520 --> 01:47:16,260
and fly up to two hours.

3466
01:47:16,530 --> 01:47:17,840
How many bullets does that?

3467
01:47:18,830 --> 01:47:21,700
But there's a really cool
video that I sent you,

3468
01:47:21,701 --> 01:47:22,800
a gym that,

3469
01:47:22,830 --> 01:47:23,221
uh,

3470
01:47:23,221 --> 01:47:28,221
it's showing it fly and it looks like a
mini airplanes unlike the drones that we

3471
01:47:28,561 --> 01:47:29,394
know of where it's,

3472
01:47:29,400 --> 01:47:30,990
they're usually like circular or,

3473
01:47:31,050 --> 01:47:32,970
or like a square or something like that.

3474
01:47:33,120 --> 01:47:35,100
This looks like a little mini jet.

3475
01:47:36,050 --> 01:47:36,800
Uh,

3476
01:47:36,800 --> 01:47:37,220
but,

3477
01:47:37,220 --> 01:47:38,053
uh,

3478
01:47:38,570 --> 01:47:40,880
I thought it was interesting
because it can carry up,

3479
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:41,450
you know,

3480
01:47:41,450 --> 01:47:44,450
22 pounds is a lot to 40
or something to carry.

3481
01:47:44,600 --> 01:47:44,750
You know,

3482
01:47:44,750 --> 01:47:45,550
it's interesting like,

3483
01:47:45,550 --> 01:47:48,320
look at the way that thing just took off
and how come they can't make plans like

3484
01:47:48,321 --> 01:47:49,154
that?

3485
01:47:49,220 --> 01:47:49,571
They did.

3486
01:47:49,571 --> 01:47:50,404
They have plans like that.

3487
01:47:51,200 --> 01:47:51,771
But I mean,

3488
01:47:51,771 --> 01:47:52,860
for people like,

3489
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:53,990
not just like for jets,

3490
01:47:53,991 --> 01:47:55,040
like for fighter jets,

3491
01:47:55,250 --> 01:47:55,431
like,

3492
01:47:55,431 --> 01:47:56,900
look at the whole front end of that thing.

3493
01:47:57,050 --> 01:48:00,410
Why can't they fill that up with fucking
passengers and have that big circle in

3494
01:48:00,411 --> 01:48:01,310
the center be that,

3495
01:48:01,790 --> 01:48:04,850
that a helicopter thing that
makes it just take off straight.

3496
01:48:05,330 --> 01:48:06,350
That's pretty dope.

3497
01:48:06,820 --> 01:48:11,740
There's another video below it that
shows a little bit more of it flying.

3498
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:13,713
MMM.

3499
01:48:14,480 --> 01:48:18,530
But they're thinking about they're
selling this so it could be used for like,

3500
01:48:18,531 --> 01:48:18,771
you know,

3501
01:48:18,771 --> 01:48:22,970
like Amazon and stuff like that and
pizza deliveries and things like that.

3502
01:48:23,350 --> 01:48:24,750
How's it going to be a real problem,

3503
01:48:24,751 --> 01:48:25,230
man?

3504
01:48:25,230 --> 01:48:27,810
It's going to be a real problem
for amateur pilots for sure.

3505
01:48:28,650 --> 01:48:28,921
I mean,

3506
01:48:28,921 --> 01:48:29,240
if,

3507
01:48:29,240 --> 01:48:30,780
if they fill the skies,

3508
01:48:30,781 --> 01:48:32,340
if they become so many of those things,

3509
01:48:32,730 --> 01:48:32,971
I mean,

3510
01:48:32,971 --> 01:48:36,090
think about if these
things become as common as,

3511
01:48:36,120 --> 01:48:37,080
I mean it probably won't,

3512
01:48:37,081 --> 01:48:40,740
but a cell phones and they're just
flying around all over the place.

3513
01:48:40,741 --> 01:48:42,210
People were sending people things.

3514
01:48:42,211 --> 01:48:42,571
Hey Man,

3515
01:48:42,571 --> 01:48:43,680
can I borrow your baseball?

3516
01:48:43,860 --> 01:48:44,131
Sure.

3517
01:48:44,131 --> 01:48:45,120
I'll fly it over to you.

3518
01:48:46,770 --> 01:48:47,750
Program it NBC.

3519
01:48:47,760 --> 01:48:48,190
This was this,

3520
01:48:48,190 --> 01:48:48,330
uh,

3521
01:48:48,330 --> 01:48:49,141
this is an Ohio,

3522
01:48:49,141 --> 01:48:49,700
right?

3523
01:48:49,700 --> 01:48:51,210
This was a second one that just happened.

3524
01:48:51,240 --> 01:48:54,360
Arrests on drone plot to surprise supply.

3525
01:48:54,361 --> 01:48:55,770
Prison contraband.

3526
01:48:55,830 --> 01:48:56,370
Oh God.

3527
01:48:56,370 --> 01:48:57,270
This is a Maryland,

3528
01:48:57,300 --> 01:48:58,110
I believe.

3529
01:48:58,110 --> 01:48:58,943
Yeah,

3530
01:48:59,400 --> 01:49:02,850
Ohio just had one off where people
were smuggling in drugs and to like

3531
01:49:02,851 --> 01:49:04,080
courtyards and stuff like that.

3532
01:49:04,470 --> 01:49:08,520
Why they got caught because the wrong
people got the drugs and there was a

3533
01:49:08,521 --> 01:49:09,354
fight.

3534
01:49:10,160 --> 01:49:10,993
Wow.

3535
01:49:13,350 --> 01:49:13,591
Look,

3536
01:49:13,591 --> 01:49:14,101
guns,

3537
01:49:14,101 --> 01:49:15,120
guns and prison.

3538
01:49:15,150 --> 01:49:16,020
That's hilarious.

3539
01:49:16,040 --> 01:49:17,790
They were smuggling and
guns are those things.

3540
01:49:17,830 --> 01:49:18,840
POKEMON cards.

3541
01:49:19,430 --> 01:49:19,710
Well,

3542
01:49:19,710 --> 01:49:22,110
what are they going to do when people
start smuggling in three d printers and

3543
01:49:22,111 --> 01:49:24,180
they can just build whatever
the fuck they want in jail.

3544
01:49:24,420 --> 01:49:24,830
Like I said,

3545
01:49:24,830 --> 01:49:25,090
hey,

3546
01:49:25,090 --> 01:49:25,923
that is that.

3547
01:49:25,960 --> 01:49:26,940
It might be tobacco.

3548
01:49:27,030 --> 01:49:28,800
That was the most of what
they had on that other one.

3549
01:49:28,980 --> 01:49:30,360
Those little things are tobacco.

3550
01:49:30,380 --> 01:49:31,350
Could be packets.

3551
01:49:31,570 --> 01:49:32,700
That's what this is on top.

3552
01:49:32,970 --> 01:49:33,900
Who cares what it is?

3553
01:49:33,901 --> 01:49:36,240
Just the idea that they can
just fly it in and drop it off.

3554
01:49:36,270 --> 01:49:38,160
Did you hear about the Pokemon convention?

3555
01:49:38,161 --> 01:49:39,450
You was it yesterday.

3556
01:49:39,480 --> 01:49:40,261
I get the newsletter.

3557
01:49:40,261 --> 01:49:41,490
I'm part of the fan club.

3558
01:49:41,700 --> 01:49:42,150
Of course.

3559
01:49:42,150 --> 01:49:42,340
No.

3560
01:49:42,340 --> 01:49:47,340
There was two gunmen that came into
a Pokemon convention with 250 rounds

3561
01:49:48,190 --> 01:49:48,701
or something like that.

3562
01:49:48,701 --> 01:49:51,250
Body over 18 dies.

3563
01:49:51,530 --> 01:49:52,110
Yeah.

3564
01:49:52,110 --> 01:49:53,060
Look at it as Pokemon at.

3565
01:49:53,130 --> 01:49:53,650
I mean,

3566
01:49:53,650 --> 01:49:55,420
who attacks Pokemon people?

3567
01:49:55,421 --> 01:49:56,980
They're like the most adorable,

3568
01:49:56,981 --> 01:49:58,240
nicest people in the world.

3569
01:49:58,241 --> 01:49:58,510
But yet,

3570
01:49:58,510 --> 01:49:59,210
look at that.

3571
01:49:59,210 --> 01:50:03,140
You said [inaudible] do you
not like the word world?

3572
01:50:03,160 --> 01:50:04,460
I don't like world.

3573
01:50:04,580 --> 01:50:05,900
Is that how you say or world?

3574
01:50:06,410 --> 01:50:07,280
How do you say it?

3575
01:50:07,310 --> 01:50:09,220
W.

3576
01:50:09,220 --> 01:50:09,220
O.

3577
01:50:09,220 --> 01:50:09,220
R.

3578
01:50:09,220 --> 01:50:09,220
