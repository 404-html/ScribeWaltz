1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:02,880
Her low freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:05,700
You're doing something
right now with this whole,

3
00:00:05,701 --> 00:00:07,350
don't be a do nothing bitch thing.

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:08,270
Dot.

5
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:10,590
Are you aware of like
how big this movement in?

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,790
I probably tweeted about it
the other day that I was out,

7
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:14,760
I forget where I was,

8
00:00:14,761 --> 00:00:17,910
but these two girls were
arguing about the merits,

9
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,760
pros and cons of being a do nothing bitch.

10
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:23,100
And it was completely,

11
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:27,120
it was all after your fight and it
was completely brought on by you.

12
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:28,380
Like some girls were like,

13
00:00:28,381 --> 00:00:29,214
well listen,

14
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,080
you know like I don't
like to fucking work.

15
00:00:31,081 --> 00:00:31,321
You know,

16
00:00:31,321 --> 00:00:31,600
I don't,

17
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,140
I don't want to know what's wrong
with being a do nothing bitch.

18
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,130
And the other girl was like,

19
00:00:35,131 --> 00:00:35,461
no,

20
00:00:35,461 --> 00:00:36,510
she's fucking right.

21
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:37,081
You know,

22
00:00:37,081 --> 00:00:41,150
like too many girls are out there and do
contribute nothing to society like you

23
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:41,820
are.

24
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:42,690
All you do is consume.

25
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,700
If you are a do nothing bitch,

26
00:00:44,701 --> 00:00:47,610
all you do is spend somebody else's
money and try to look pretty.

27
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:49,830
Like that's all you do
is you use stuff up,

28
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,110
you use up resources and you give nothing.

29
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,570
And so you're a pretty
much a drain on society.

30
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:56,810
That's what I think they,

31
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,170
they don't think it that way.

32
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,700
They think what they are is something
that all of these men want to fuck low.

33
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:03,680
So in,

34
00:01:03,681 --> 00:01:06,390
in working really hard to attain this,

35
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,470
this appearance and all
these men want to fuck that.

36
00:01:10,471 --> 00:01:11,140
Uh,

37
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:11,821
what they are,

38
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:12,051
they've,

39
00:01:12,051 --> 00:01:13,620
they've created capital.

40
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,680
They've created like a need for this
brought up to think that it wasn't your

41
00:01:19,351 --> 00:01:20,670
mission in life to be happy.

42
00:01:20,671 --> 00:01:24,060
It was your mission in life to leave
the world better than how you found it.

43
00:01:24,061 --> 00:01:25,230
And by being a comeback at,

44
00:01:25,231 --> 00:01:26,064
you're not going to do that.

45
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,440
It's not your mission in life.

46
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:31,753
That I love that.

47
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:32,643
Like introducing

48
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:34,880
like,

49
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,190
yes,

50
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:35,851
I invented that.

51
00:01:35,851 --> 00:01:35,971
No,

52
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:36,390
I did it.

53
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,690
That's a fascinating thing to say that
it's not your mission in life to be

54
00:01:39,691 --> 00:01:40,524
happy.

55
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:41,981
So,

56
00:01:41,981 --> 00:01:44,400
but what's the point in leaving
the world better if no one's happy,

57
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:46,680
if everybody follows that same principle,

58
00:01:46,681 --> 00:01:48,960
the world just keeps getting better
and better and everybody's miserable as

59
00:01:48,961 --> 00:01:49,794
fuck.

60
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:52,900
He doesn't seem to make sense here.

61
00:01:52,901 --> 00:01:55,980
Your happiness is supposed to be a
byproduct of actually living a fulfilling

62
00:01:55,981 --> 00:01:56,814
life.

63
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:57,241
You know,

64
00:01:57,241 --> 00:01:58,710
instead of just trying to,

65
00:01:59,060 --> 00:01:59,460
you know,

66
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,190
if I tried to get drunk and party every
day and get as happy as I possibly could

67
00:02:02,191 --> 00:02:03,024
every day,

68
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:03,631
you know,

69
00:02:03,631 --> 00:02:06,900
I'm going to live at a really
unfulfilling life and die unhappy.

70
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:07,740
This isn't,

71
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,570
this is not like a micro aggression.

72
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,690
This is human curiosity had
something that's abnormal.

73
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:13,080
Yeah.

74
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,240
It's not a bad thing that it's abnormal.

75
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:19,140
It's not that there's a gender issue
that you wish you were a woman,

76
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,081
man,

77
00:02:20,081 --> 00:02:21,430
are you wish you were a
man or you're born a woman.

78
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,570
It's not a bad thing.

79
00:02:22,571 --> 00:02:23,080
It's just,

80
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,680
it is.

81
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,970
There is a difference though.

82
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,740
And I think that we,

83
00:02:26,741 --> 00:02:31,741
what we're experiencing now
with the transgender movement
and even to an extent,

84
00:02:32,141 --> 00:02:36,310
the gay movement is the pendulum
swinging all the way in one direction.

85
00:02:36,311 --> 00:02:36,880
And it's a,

86
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,950
it's a reaction to the fact that,

87
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,930
and this is just a fact,

88
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:46,030
when you were a man or a woman and
you felt overwhelmingly like you are a

89
00:02:46,031 --> 00:02:50,560
different sex and you took measures to
correct your current sex or you just

90
00:02:50,561 --> 00:02:53,200
dressed up in a way that
made you feel more yourself.

91
00:02:53,201 --> 00:02:55,060
So if you're a man and you're
dressed in drag or whatever,

92
00:02:55,061 --> 00:02:57,310
as a woman or for that matter,

93
00:02:57,311 --> 00:03:01,730
if you were gay and started having
feelings when you include the,

94
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:05,020
the problem was that
in most of our history,

95
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,510
you got the fucking
shit kicked out of you,

96
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:11,440
killed your job,

97
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:13,840
got ostracized and that anger and that,

98
00:03:13,841 --> 00:03:15,670
that injustice doesn't,

99
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:16,960
doesn't go away.

100
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,930
And so you have a lot of
people that have that,

101
00:03:19,931 --> 00:03:22,120
that memory is very fresh.

102
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,630
That wound is very real.

103
00:03:23,631 --> 00:03:25,990
So let's have some fake
pronouns the way that,

104
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:26,531
the way,

105
00:03:26,531 --> 00:03:28,780
the way that is.

106
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:29,490
Then the,

107
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:30,190
then,

108
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:30,311
uh,

109
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:31,390
try to,

110
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:32,080
uh,

111
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,740
control the majority of
the population's behavior.

112
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:40,830
What about I don't hear z h I
like that they have those z.

113
00:03:40,901 --> 00:03:41,734
It's one of them.

114
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:42,221
I know.

115
00:03:42,221 --> 00:03:42,670
I was in,

116
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:43,031
I listened.

117
00:03:43,031 --> 00:03:44,320
I went to high school in Massachusetts.

118
00:03:44,321 --> 00:03:45,620
I remember when I knew when I had to,

119
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,480
when I had to say,

120
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:47,680
I couldn't say freshmen,

121
00:03:47,681 --> 00:03:48,970
I had to say fresh person.

122
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:52,630
I dated a girl who graduated from
Wellesley college with a degree in women's

123
00:03:52,631 --> 00:03:53,464
studies,

124
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:55,480
women's studies.

125
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:56,643
It's all about women.

126
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:56,921
Yeah,

127
00:03:56,921 --> 00:03:57,754
I know.

128
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,013
It's wonderful.

129
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,460
I should shave her legs.

130
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,350
There was a white girl I suffered.

131
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:05,170
I dated a white girl and
she didn't share her legs.

132
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,060
Yeah.

133
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:07,893
It's very European.

134
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:09,481
No,

135
00:04:09,481 --> 00:04:10,480
it's pretty hippie bro.

136
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:10,920
That's it.

137
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,190
It's nothing to do with European me.

138
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,121
That's fine.

139
00:04:13,121 --> 00:04:13,390
But her,

140
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,530
her roommate was Greek.

141
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:15,500
I got in trouble.

142
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:15,820
Guess what?

143
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:19,420
Her feet looked like Bilbo
Baggins women are hot though.

144
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,231
Hairy feet,

145
00:04:20,231 --> 00:04:20,471
bro.

146
00:04:20,471 --> 00:04:20,741
Shit,

147
00:04:20,741 --> 00:04:22,120
here he toes hairy feet.

148
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:23,200
This was the girl you were with?

149
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:23,500
Nope.

150
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:23,951
The other girl,

151
00:04:23,951 --> 00:04:24,130
her,

152
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:24,963
her roommate.

153
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,200
When you're a younger man,

154
00:04:26,201 --> 00:04:27,034
you'll fuck a bear.

155
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,873
It does.

156
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:28,901
I mean,

157
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:29,291
I'm a go.

158
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:30,190
She was beautiful,

159
00:04:30,191 --> 00:04:31,660
but she was blonde like,

160
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:31,960
oh,

161
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,010
she's a pretty girl.

162
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:33,923
And uh,

163
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,021
the,

164
00:04:35,021 --> 00:04:35,290
uh,

165
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:38,590
the roommate there was a girl I
dated who was liberal white girl.

166
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,011
Oh,

167
00:04:39,011 --> 00:04:39,550
that's not real.

168
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:44,550
There was this white girl and she
majored in African studies in college.

169
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,870
And I went and all I did was this.

170
00:04:46,871 --> 00:04:47,500
I go,

171
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,333
why?

172
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,170
Because I knew the answer was she was a
liberal white girl and just wanted other

173
00:04:53,171 --> 00:04:53,680
black people.

174
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,260
It'd be like,

175
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,390
you're my favorite white.

176
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,920
You're my favorite white.

177
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:58,570
And you understand us
and your town with our,

178
00:04:58,571 --> 00:04:59,404
cause.

179
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:03,610
I know it wasn't because she
was interested in African
studies and then I said,

180
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:04,570
because I said,

181
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:04,931
why?

182
00:05:04,931 --> 00:05:05,440
Why,

183
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:05,891
why?

184
00:05:05,891 --> 00:05:06,401
What about,

185
00:05:06,401 --> 00:05:08,920
why did you choose to
study African studies?

186
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:13,180
Not that there's anything wrong with
it and not say what you come from,

187
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:15,130
like European history.

188
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,240
Why would you care what she's telling you?

189
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,740
I just wanted to know the answer.

190
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,071
Okay.

191
00:05:18,071 --> 00:05:18,910
And what was her answer?

192
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,010
She said her answer was,

193
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:23,440
I wish she wasn't even in the black guys.

194
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,401
She goes,

195
00:05:24,401 --> 00:05:24,610
uh,

196
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:25,840
I find that question offensive.

197
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:27,603
And I said,

198
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:28,211
Whoa,

199
00:05:28,211 --> 00:05:29,170
that's what I thought you'd say.

200
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,520
It was really man,

201
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:31,911
really funny.

202
00:05:31,911 --> 00:05:34,460
It's like you always see gangsters on TV,

203
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,720
but when you are confronted
by true psychopaths,

204
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,970
it is unbelievable.

205
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:41,841
You know?

206
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:42,111
I,

207
00:05:42,111 --> 00:05:42,944
uh,

208
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,230
well I told the story with Jerry one son,

209
00:05:45,231 --> 00:05:46,160
his community and coffee,

210
00:05:46,161 --> 00:05:47,360
but I didn't hear it.

211
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:48,081
Okay,

212
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:48,680
I got it.

213
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,770
I got a call one day from a Sinatra,

214
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:53,170
he says,

215
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:55,820
[inaudible] sons of Italy dinner in Italy.

216
00:05:55,821 --> 00:05:56,270
Can,

217
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,170
can you do it one it,

218
00:05:57,171 --> 00:05:58,010
it gives me the day.

219
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,510
And I said,

220
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:00,343
oh,

221
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,131
Mrs Sinatra,

222
00:06:01,131 --> 00:06:05,180
I'm at the holiday house in Pennsylvania
with the sons of the pioneers.

223
00:06:05,181 --> 00:06:06,014
That's what the old,

224
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:06,351
I said,

225
00:06:06,351 --> 00:06:07,640
I'm opening for them on that day.

226
00:06:07,641 --> 00:06:08,750
I'd love to do it for you,

227
00:06:08,751 --> 00:06:09,584
but I can't do it.

228
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:10,670
Oh,

229
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,031
okay.

230
00:06:11,031 --> 00:06:11,220
Thanks.

231
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:11,931
I said a police,

232
00:06:11,931 --> 00:06:12,764
any of

233
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:15,271
couple of hours later,

234
00:06:15,271 --> 00:06:18,050
I get a call from Sinatra's agent.

235
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,010
Uh,

236
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:19,221
hey,

237
00:06:19,221 --> 00:06:20,240
we call it a holiday house.

238
00:06:20,241 --> 00:06:21,074
They said they don't need you.

239
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:22,823
I don't need Ya.

240
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:24,470
All right.

241
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:25,400
Guess I'm going to Chicago.

242
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,230
So I got to Chicago and it's this Italian,

243
00:06:30,231 --> 00:06:32,480
I'm not going to use any real names
because if people are still around,

244
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,600
so it's doing this thing
instead of golf course.

245
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,670
And they say to me,

246
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:37,701
listen,

247
00:06:37,701 --> 00:06:38,660
there's a priest here.

248
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,171
Okay,

249
00:06:39,171 --> 00:06:40,280
so keep your act,

250
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:40,630
you know,

251
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:41,151
clean it.

252
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:41,961
Then I said to me,

253
00:06:41,961 --> 00:06:42,794
okay fine.

254
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:43,971
So I got up on,

255
00:06:43,971 --> 00:06:45,260
I do my little act to find.

256
00:06:45,261 --> 00:06:45,561
Thank you.

257
00:06:45,561 --> 00:06:45,921
Applause,

258
00:06:45,921 --> 00:06:46,760
applause to sit down.

259
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:49,850
So this gangster guy gets up,

260
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,270
you know,

261
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,920
he goes on a welcome Y'alls tourists,

262
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:52,843
uh,

263
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:55,880
you notice this place and
it wasn't going to say,

264
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:56,721
Oh shit,

265
00:06:56,721 --> 00:06:56,991
I forgot.

266
00:06:56,991 --> 00:06:57,824
I was going to say,

267
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:58,191
and what?

268
00:06:58,191 --> 00:06:58,461
He said,

269
00:06:58,461 --> 00:06:58,761
Shit.

270
00:06:58,761 --> 00:06:59,594
The priests went

271
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:02,450
like this.

272
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:02,841
The guy goes,

273
00:07:02,841 --> 00:07:03,674
wow,

274
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:04,723
hey father,

275
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:06,770
you've got your 10 grand on a fucking bag.

276
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,833
Shut off.

277
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:12,980
It just goes crazy on his
gut and the places just,

278
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:14,623
everybody's just,

279
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:15,910
just frozen with Thea.

280
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,281
This guy,

281
00:07:16,281 --> 00:07:17,480
he's just like crazy.

282
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,553
And the priest was like,

283
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,220
he's holding this bag with the 10 grand.

284
00:07:20,221 --> 00:07:20,810
Did he know?

285
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:21,650
And then he sits now.

286
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:24,110
So when I'm sitting in the guy,

287
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:24,471
come late,

288
00:07:24,471 --> 00:07:24,650
Jay,

289
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:25,370
come here.

290
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:25,581
He goes,

291
00:07:25,581 --> 00:07:26,450
let me ask you something.

292
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:27,891
You know stone,

293
00:07:27,891 --> 00:07:28,130
right?

294
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:28,311
I said,

295
00:07:28,311 --> 00:07:30,290
why don't know him that
you rocky just come out.

296
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:31,700
This is 1976 at me.

297
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:32,751
I said,

298
00:07:32,751 --> 00:07:33,321
I don't know him.

299
00:07:33,321 --> 00:07:33,750
I mean,

300
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:34,583
I met him,

301
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:34,881
you know,

302
00:07:34,881 --> 00:07:36,290
we ask them to do this dinner,

303
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,640
this benefit today.

304
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,121
He said,

305
00:07:38,121 --> 00:07:38,954
no.

306
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,261
He said,

307
00:07:39,261 --> 00:07:40,094
no.

308
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:40,993
And I said,

309
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,510
well,

310
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:41,990
I mean,

311
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:42,860
maybe he was busy

312
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:45,671
Fridays.

313
00:07:45,671 --> 00:07:46,760
Quit screaming at me.

314
00:07:46,761 --> 00:07:47,330
I go,

315
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:47,931
you're right,

316
00:07:47,931 --> 00:07:48,360
I'm sure.

317
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,193
But yeah,

318
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,313
I'm fine.

319
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,193
He goes to,

320
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:52,183
he goes up,

321
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:52,911
this is,

322
00:07:52,911 --> 00:07:53,181
come on,

323
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:54,020
let's play some golf.

324
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:55,370
I played golf.

325
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:56,990
I don't play golf.

326
00:07:56,991 --> 00:07:57,490
I can look it up.

327
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:00,270
She's an hour in golf carts
and my boy in this golf cart,

328
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:04,730
we drive out to about the 12th hole and
we get to the 12th hole and there are

329
00:08:04,731 --> 00:08:09,731
these kind of 50 60 year old prostitutes
topless with leopard skin print,

330
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:11,690
mini skirts,

331
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:12,710
handing out drinks.

332
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:15,530
It was like the craziest day of my life.

333
00:08:15,531 --> 00:08:19,130
But this guy was like
a true psycho criminal.

334
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,401
I mean,

335
00:08:19,401 --> 00:08:21,730
just one of those guys like
a scene from Goodfellas.

336
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,460
It just kill it.

337
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:22,641
You know,

338
00:08:22,641 --> 00:08:25,580
I always loved movies where somebody
threatened someone and they go,

339
00:08:25,581 --> 00:08:26,570
you're not going to kill me by,

340
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,340
because I know you're not the kind of guy.

341
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,000
No,

342
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,331
no.

343
00:08:29,331 --> 00:08:30,164
They will kill you.

344
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,093
They will kill you.

345
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,900
And they've just really made me laugh.

346
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,010
Is that guy still alive?

347
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:34,640
Uh,

348
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,030
I,

349
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,020
he may still be alive.

350
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:36,943
Really?

351
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:37,550
Nah,

352
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,301
this is a while ago.

353
00:08:38,301 --> 00:08:40,340
He's probably dead by now
because he was an old guy then.

354
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:41,270
Yeah,

355
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,290
it seems like a guy like that.

356
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:43,130
It's not going to make it.

357
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:43,940
I'll tell you.

358
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:44,511
I'll tell you his name.

359
00:08:44,511 --> 00:08:44,630
No,

360
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,460
he made it through the teammates.

361
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:47,890
Wow.

362
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:48,723
Just hilarious.

363
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:58,490
Yeah.
