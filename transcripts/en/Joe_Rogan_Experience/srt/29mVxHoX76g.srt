1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,180
I'll never forget.
Five,

2
00:00:01,181 --> 00:00:02,020
four,
three,

3
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:03,880
two,
one.

4
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:07,260
Yes.
How the fuck is it?

5
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:10,180
Been so many years and you haven't been
on here.

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,910
This is ridiculous timing,
everything.

7
00:00:12,911 --> 00:00:15,940
There's times you go super busy and you
too.

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,820
It's really good seeing yet fucking
awesome seeing you,

9
00:00:18,821 --> 00:00:19,900
man.
It's really awesome seeing,

10
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:21,160
yeah,
this is a weird thing because we're

11
00:00:21,161 --> 00:00:23,230
having this conversation and people are
listening to it,

12
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:25,190
but at the same time,
uh,

13
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:27,490
you know,
you're one of my favorite people and I'm

14
00:00:27,491 --> 00:00:31,360
fucking known you forever.
We were friends when we were both

15
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:35,710
hungry,
scrappy young comedians with no idea

16
00:00:35,711 --> 00:00:37,450
what the fuck was going to happen.
Right know.

17
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:38,340
And we were both like,
Whoa,

18
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:40,270
Whoa,
what the fuck is going to happen in the

19
00:00:40,271 --> 00:00:41,104
future?
Well,

20
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,070
you know what that's like,
there's a bond that you have with people

21
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:49,370
that like you and I were essentially in
the same place and are in our lives in

22
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,940
the same place,
our comedy careers at the same time.

23
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,250
And you know,
I tell everyone I remember what I,

24
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:59,020
what I liked about you,
how real and honest you were.

25
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,650
You were.
And you were also like,

26
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,480
oh,
you want to do is play pool,

27
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:05,630
which I didn't know shit about pool and
I can't.

28
00:01:05,631 --> 00:01:06,441
It's all right.
It's all right.

29
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:10,850
We got to play pool and I would sock and
I can tell you get bored real quick and

30
00:01:10,851 --> 00:01:14,150
then you'd have it.
You go to a pool halls and you'd fucking

31
00:01:14,151 --> 00:01:16,280
work out.
Did you want to go to the gym?

32
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:17,600
Like all right,
we'll go to the gym,

33
00:01:17,601 --> 00:01:22,220
but you beat up like an hour and a half
and I got to say is,

34
00:01:22,221 --> 00:01:25,130
I watched your whole career grow and
grow and grow.

35
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:30,970
I can tell when the fighting came along
the UFC and my,

36
00:01:31,071 --> 00:01:34,400
am I wrong to say you probably were the
happiest.

37
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:39,920
That was not the greatest job ever.
It was because you never changed all you

38
00:01:39,921 --> 00:01:42,530
all.
I knew you as a tough guy.

39
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,220
Honest guy played billiards,
worked out.

40
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:47,420
I've heard you say,
dude,

41
00:01:47,421 --> 00:01:52,421
I'll fucking choke you out right now.
These guys were at a craft table for a

42
00:01:53,271 --> 00:01:54,980
Disney show,
which,

43
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:57,390
which shows us what was the

44
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:59,170
baseball show?
Oh,

45
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:00,580
hardball.
That's right,

46
00:02:00,581 --> 00:02:02,740
dude,
you are the fucking pioneer.

47
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:05,350
Harven Dude,
I have a photo of us,

48
00:02:05,351 --> 00:02:07,780
a monkey.
I have a photo of us that I have to

49
00:02:07,781 --> 00:02:10,750
bring in.
I have to bring it in because I got,

50
00:02:10,751 --> 00:02:12,970
fuck,
I've got to find no exact where I put

51
00:02:12,971 --> 00:02:14,200
it.
I don't have to find a no exact,

52
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:19,201
it's you and me from like 1993 we look
like babies are babies.

53
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:23,740
We look like babies and with Ruthann
remember the agent?

54
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:28,210
Yes dude dude,
that was a funny role.

55
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:31,450
That was a,
that was one of my favorite examples of

56
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:35,110
a show that could have been a really
funny show written by really funny guys

57
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:40,000
and the network's juice all over it.
They just stuck their own.

58
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:47,060
This is my now and they ruined it.
Ruined it did.

59
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,530
But you get,
you were there at the pilot,

60
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:53,950
you're on the,
you're on the craft line.

61
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:57,190
Craft services,
which to me that was the greatest party.

62
00:02:57,191 --> 00:02:59,740
Even filming anything.
I was still,

63
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,720
I was still,
this is free,

64
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:03,880
go like guts.
So there was a guy,

65
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,240
young fucking little guy,
just,

66
00:03:07,241 --> 00:03:11,140
he probably wants to be an actor,
but he's serving rice to us and he said

67
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:12,820
he has a shirt,
says I love karate

68
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:17,120
and you're just fucking,
is it?

69
00:03:17,121 --> 00:03:18,850
Here come,
you're fucking,

70
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:21,070
you're all hot tub.
And he got to dig.

71
00:03:21,071 --> 00:03:25,420
You take karate and the kid goes your
yet get off.

72
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,310
I,
I don't know why.

73
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:28,960
I don't know if it's said kickbox and
whatever.

74
00:03:28,961 --> 00:03:31,660
He said,
I'd fucking crazy socks.

75
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:34,330
It's the fucking worst.
Didn't know what,

76
00:03:34,331 --> 00:03:36,370
there's no way.
You're not mischaracterizing this

77
00:03:36,371 --> 00:03:37,810
conversation.
No,

78
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:39,550
it does.
No way it happened like that.

79
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,800
Like I just walked up till God deal
rice.

80
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,341
It's like,
dude,

81
00:03:42,341 --> 00:03:43,480
karate socks.
No,

82
00:03:43,481 --> 00:03:43,900
no,
no.

83
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,300
He had his shirt Kinda Kreidie shirt and
that was enough.

84
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:50,310
None of it.
You started poking questions for him.

85
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,970
You were like asking is teligent you
like,

86
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:53,741
hey man,
what's you,

87
00:03:53,741 --> 00:03:55,260
uh,
Eh,

88
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:58,780
we'll get you into karate.
And then he would go something like,

89
00:03:58,781 --> 00:04:00,130
you know,
I like the martial arts.

90
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,690
And then you would say,
dude,

91
00:04:01,691 --> 00:04:02,890
you should take this.
He was like,

92
00:04:02,891 --> 00:04:04,960
no,
I think karate guy would win it.

93
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,900
And then I saw you just like,
dude,

94
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:10,330
I'm telling you right now,
fucking crush it.

95
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,620
But the point of that conversation was I
couldn't,

96
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,960
I just never saw anyone like you and my
life.

97
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:22,020
I,
you're like a fucking that moment we go,

98
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:26,470
the sky is so he's an he didn't you?
You were fearless.

99
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:30,790
I'd never seen anyone so fearless in my
life and I've always looked up to you

100
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:33,740
for that
bag.

101
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:38,460
I definitely never been fearless.
I'm not a feel of the person just took

102
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:39,320
that.
Oh No,

103
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:40,154
no,
no,

104
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,193
no,
no,

105
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,633
no.
Not at all.

106
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,040
I'm fucking around.
But I've never been fearless.

107
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:47,380
I'm scared of everything.
But this is how you,

108
00:04:47,381 --> 00:04:49,450
uh,
how you respond to it.

109
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,930
It's how you respond to fear whether or
not you're scared of some of the

110
00:04:52,931 --> 00:04:56,710
unknown.
Most people shy away from the unknown,

111
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,633
you know?

112
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,290
Okay.

113
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:02,170
That is very true.
But it's hard to get honest because

114
00:05:02,171 --> 00:05:06,460
sometimes there's a lot of deeper
factors in is a lot of eyes on you.

115
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,980
You don't think your kids are eyes are
on you,

116
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,440
you to expose him to stuff.
So it's a little like,

117
00:05:11,441 --> 00:05:12,610
um,
I'm a feared to be,

118
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:15,820
I fear being aleut too honest at times.
Right.

119
00:05:15,821 --> 00:05:17,070
I see what you're saying,
Byron off.

120
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,120
That's right or wrong.
Right.

121
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:19,660
I know.
Look,

122
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:22,840
you kind of protecting yourself or your
kids in a,

123
00:05:22,841 --> 00:05:25,810
in a lot of ways from how you are,
because you don't want them to kind of

124
00:05:25,811 --> 00:05:28,900
be as wild and crazy as you were when
you were young.

125
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:31,120
Like with the pot thing and stuff like
that.

126
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:32,890
Well,
like here,

127
00:05:32,891 --> 00:05:33,930
let me ask you this.
Okay.

128
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:39,460
If you're,
let's see how old your you have.

129
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,560
How old?
$3.

130
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,930
Okay.
I have three doors.

131
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,350
If one door to goes and you could tell
they're starting to kind of get into

132
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:50,890
pot.
They want to grow faster.

133
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,290
Why do you want to let them,
don't you think you were doing it when

134
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,770
you were like 14?
Yeah.

135
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:59,540
14 now I'm going to say
seven.

136
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,500
Tina's,
I was a late bloomer,

137
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:06,580
so I got into it a little bit with some
friends when I was like 12 and 13 yeah,

138
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,370
we got some pot.
Well,

139
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,583
yeah.
Wow.

140
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:12,150
Yeah.
But I didn't get it.

141
00:06:12,151 --> 00:06:14,030
And that's my middle daughter.
Yeah.

142
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:17,610
It happens to do you leave them alone,
leave those little fuckers alone.

143
00:06:17,611 --> 00:06:21,930
They get ahold of some music.
That's what it is,

144
00:06:21,931 --> 00:06:23,040
man.
You know,

145
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:24,300
with us,
we would,

146
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:26,010
uh,
we would go over this fucking dude's

147
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:28,590
house and we'd listened to bad company
and we'd,

148
00:06:28,591 --> 00:06:30,000
uh,
we'd get some pot.

149
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:35,500
See the,
I was still into sports at that time,

150
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,150
but so when I discovered it,

151
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:38,800
okay,

152
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,070
I was into the metal,
right.

153
00:06:41,071 --> 00:06:45,460
So we would go in the basement and we
turn on and bornite when I heard,

154
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,890
when I heard,
and I dunno if that's another weird part

155
00:06:47,891 --> 00:06:49,750
of me,
why was I attracted to that?

156
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,840
I heard them,
I heard that fast,

157
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,270
furious.
And that made me ape shit.

158
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:58,300
It's great for a young guy,

159
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:02,140
for a young guy that's the music that
sort of represents your hormones.

160
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:06,770
You know,
John got out,

161
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,710
you know,
you're fucking 17.

162
00:07:10,711 --> 00:07:12,030
You're like,
yeah,

163
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:12,991
you know,
and,

164
00:07:12,991 --> 00:07:15,870
and also your suppressed all the time.
Like everyone's like,

165
00:07:15,871 --> 00:07:17,640
calm down,
settle down,

166
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:19,200
not so loud.
Right.

167
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,120
Stop fucking each other.
Hold on.

168
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:25,830
And then some music comes up and it
just,

169
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,550
you know,

170
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,290
it releases all that madness.
Yeah.

171
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,450
It comes out.
You feel it,

172
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:34,080
you feel the music understands you.
I know.

173
00:07:34,081 --> 00:07:38,310
But I fear,
here's my biggest fear as a dad getting

174
00:07:38,311 --> 00:07:39,840
addicted to shit.
Yeah.

175
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,350
And get pregnant.
Yeah.

176
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,100
While those things are both,
uh,

177
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:47,510
the reality is that everybody faces when
you're young,

178
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:48,541
you know,
and,

179
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:51,740
and also biologically everybody faces it
seems like with pills.

180
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:55,550
I know so many people that have gotten
addicted to pills.

181
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,950
I mean,
it's an epidemic.

182
00:07:58,610 --> 00:07:59,181
I'm,
no,

183
00:07:59,181 --> 00:08:02,870
I'm known if I had a sit down and have
all the people that I've been close

184
00:08:02,871 --> 00:08:04,730
enough to to call on a regular base and
say,

185
00:08:04,731 --> 00:08:05,720
how you doing?
What's going on?

186
00:08:05,721 --> 00:08:06,770
You know,
have conversation with them.

187
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:10,400
Yeah.
Maybe a dozen have been hooked on pills

188
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,890
and I know three people that have died
from it.

189
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:16,540
Well,
there weren't,

190
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,870
I don't remember pills and weird

191
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,600
kids did it.
They didn't happen.

192
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:22,600
They didn't exist at all.
You would hear like,

193
00:08:22,601 --> 00:08:25,390
some people get in like vicodins and
shit like that,

194
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:29,050
but those were always like crazy people.
Don't you think kind of though

195
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:32,690
it's,
they're all prescription pills,

196
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:33,990
right?
Yeah,

197
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:34,923
yeah.
No,

198
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:35,811
yeah,
no,

199
00:08:35,811 --> 00:08:36,591
absolutely.
Definitely.

200
00:08:36,591 --> 00:08:37,290
Right.
Definitely.

201
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:38,750
Right.
So if they're prescribed,

202
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:42,450
does it seem as like,
oh,

203
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,950
they figured out how to legalize really
bad trucks down?

204
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,250
Well,
they definitely did.

205
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:51,360
They figured out a build trust does more
because we'll wear these white lab coats

206
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,800
and we had to tell them and we write out
the little card and just take three of

207
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:56,634
these a week

208
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:00,870
and be able to stop.
That's another suppressed guy.

209
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,420
But that guy listened to some death
metal from feminine,

210
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:08,970
you know,
let me get this fucking car after

211
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:13,260
selling heroin all day with a lab coat
on,

212
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,560
that's a dark.
There was an article about this one.

213
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:22,500
It's insane.
There was an article about this one

214
00:09:22,501 --> 00:09:24,830
family that has a,
um,

215
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:30,510
has like a giant steak in that market
and they've made billions and billions

216
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:32,910
of dollars and it was breaking down like
how much money they made and how many

217
00:09:32,911 --> 00:09:35,010
people are hooked on it,
how many prescriptions there are.

218
00:09:35,011 --> 00:09:38,430
It's like they're just,
they're drug dealers like the legalized.

219
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:40,680
Well if you looked at this in the
future,

220
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,540
like when they look back and they say,
oh,

221
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:45,930
remember those opium dens and the
cowboys had remembered from Wyatt earp,

222
00:09:45,931 --> 00:09:49,350
was it wider wild bill Hickok one of
them fucking movies.

223
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,950
They went to the opium den that Chinese
people got them all fucked up on opium

224
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:54,210
and we were like,
Whoa,

225
00:09:54,211 --> 00:09:57,450
those are dark times.
This is way worse than that.

226
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,760
I agree.
And it's happening underneath our noses.

227
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:04,853
Look,
don't you see?

228
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,930
How do you stop that?
That's a good question.

229
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:10,260
Cause you can talk about it forever.
And I think,

230
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:15,570
I think you've talked about enough.
I even brought up to people and it's,

231
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,080
it's sort of the old again.
You face it.

232
00:10:18,081 --> 00:10:20,490
What do you do now?
We can talk about it forever,

233
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,310
but what do you actually do?
Teachers just talk about it and let

234
00:10:23,311 --> 00:10:26,670
people live seep into people and he
think he's telling the truth or you

235
00:10:26,671 --> 00:10:28,140
think they know what they're saying?
Dude.

236
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:30,720
That why things decide for themselves.
Any,

237
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:32,610
um,
anything that you're going to let your

238
00:10:32,611 --> 00:10:35,880
kid figure out for themselves.
You're like depriving them of

239
00:10:35,881 --> 00:10:37,020
information.
Right?

240
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:40,260
So I think what you gotta do is be like
really honest about it.

241
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:45,280
And I'm with my oldest daughter,
the young girls don't know that I smoked

242
00:10:45,281 --> 00:10:47,970
the weed,
but we just had conversations about it.

243
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,720
I said,
listen,

244
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,720
there are some things that are dangerous
and there are some things that are just

245
00:10:51,721 --> 00:10:55,410
not dangerous at all.
And pod is the one that's not dangerous

246
00:10:55,411 --> 00:10:56,600
at all.
Like my,

247
00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:00,660
my wife and I had a conversation with
her about it and you know,

248
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:02,940
it's a weird sort of a conversation
cause you're,

249
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:05,760
you're talking to someone who on the
verge of being an adult,

250
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:07,980
right?
So you're kind of bullshitting them

251
00:11:07,981 --> 00:11:10,980
still but not really course.
Whereas if they were an adult you'd be

252
00:11:10,981 --> 00:11:12,420
like,
Look Pot's not hurting anybody.

253
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:14,130
I smoked pot before I go to bed.
I do too.

254
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:15,870
And then everybody would laugh.
Hahaha.

255
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:16,680
You know,
from here on,

256
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,820
I like it right before her.
I'm sorry.

257
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,090
And then you know,
you have these little conversations with

258
00:11:21,091 --> 00:11:22,320
people with,
with adults,

259
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,990
but when the kid that about th that come
in and don't,

260
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:26,883
don't,
don't tell him.

261
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,280
Right.
You want to keep somehow or another this

262
00:11:29,281 --> 00:11:33,150
innocuous thing from the kids.
But meanwhile you'll sip a glass of wine

263
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:35,280
in front of him.
I'll drink a glass of wine from my kids

264
00:11:35,281 --> 00:11:37,110
all the time.
I've let them try wine.

265
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:41,010
I've let him try a sip of wine and try
this gas tank and then it becomes a

266
00:11:41,011 --> 00:11:43,650
funny thing they talk about,
remember that time I tried to wine?

267
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,420
Oh my God.
So grabs.

268
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:47,910
But it's socially accepted.
Yeah.

269
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:51,750
To let them taste how disgusting adults
tasting beverages are.

270
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:54,100
But,
but smoking pot in

271
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,280
front of them or around them would be
horrific.

272
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:59,560
It's so foolish sheets,
you know?

273
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:04,150
Did you know anyone?
I remember I knew a kid and he was up

274
00:12:04,151 --> 00:12:08,150
the street
and he smoked pot when his parents and

275
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,050
his salmon,
we're going to go in there and smoke pot

276
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,850
when the parents,
but my initial,

277
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:13,773
I don't know,
my,

278
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:15,400
my instinct was like,
oh,

279
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,160
that's weird.
It's just weird.

280
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,550
I can't hit it.
That's weird.

281
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,610
I guess it is,
but I don't know.

282
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,530
You know?
I mean,

283
00:12:23,531 --> 00:12:25,410
it's not really,
if,

284
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,370
if having a drink with your dad's not
weird,

285
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:29,740
how come you can't,
having a beer with your dad is not

286
00:12:29,741 --> 00:12:31,420
weird.
I'll give you for instance.

287
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:32,380
Okay,
sorry.

288
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,440
My Dad,
he,

289
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,410
he never drank with me.
He never said,

290
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,510
but he was,
everyone else would say,

291
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:43,120
sky's fucking like brewers.
You're dead.

292
00:12:43,121 --> 00:12:45,370
This guy's nuts.
Like my father's nuts.

293
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:50,640
I didn't see that side of him at all.
So not until it was my 21st birthday.

294
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,620
Like I just knew him as his fucking Dad,
right?

295
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:58,390
World War Two vet and shit like that.
Serious guy.

296
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,280
Very serious.
Never left.

297
00:13:00,281 --> 00:13:05,281
And I think he left twice the filthy or
the funny and his laugh was just like,

298
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:09,400
that was,
that was killing him that you fucking

299
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,120
corona.
So

300
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:15,490
I swear to God.
So,

301
00:13:15,491 --> 00:13:18,250
um,
when I was 21,

302
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,250
he said,
let's go have a beer.

303
00:13:21,251 --> 00:13:24,890
You're a man now.
So we went to his place,

304
00:13:24,891 --> 00:13:29,891
swamp water,
als when I was in Florida and one out

305
00:13:30,011 --> 00:13:34,300
and have a couple of beers.
He's saying some ca he doesn't talk,

306
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:38,140
he'll say stupid jokes and I don't
really understand.

307
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,390
I'm bored.
I go outside,

308
00:13:40,391 --> 00:13:45,391
catch a buzz and we got this will help
the fucking night I come back and catch

309
00:13:45,461 --> 00:13:46,690
a buzz means smoke a little weed.

310
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,850
Yes.
I come back in.

311
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:50,800
Um,
and he's,

312
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:54,460
there's a crowd around him and I swear
to God because he was older,

313
00:13:54,461 --> 00:13:56,410
I thought he,
I thought he was down.

314
00:13:56,411 --> 00:13:58,440
Everyone was looking at the old man up
for it.

315
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:03,450
Go there and he's fucking holding court
with the whole bar and he's,

316
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:05,710
he's killing,
he's destroying.

317
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:11,530
And so then I turned around like,
who is this fucking guy?

318
00:14:11,531 --> 00:14:13,300
I want to hire him.
He's fucking hilarious.

319
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:15,760
And I just couldn't understand.
I never saw this man.

320
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,590
So I had a beer,
he had a beer,

321
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:21,430
we caught buses and we had the phone.
I never saw,

322
00:14:21,431 --> 00:14:24,100
my father was funny and I said,
where,

323
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,650
why didn't,
why didn't you show me this side

324
00:14:26,651 --> 00:14:28,210
earlier?
I would hear this from all my friends.

325
00:14:28,211 --> 00:14:29,830
He goes,
you weren't fucking ready.

326
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:40,350
That's hilarious.
But I kind of feel that way with certain

327
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:41,650
kids.
Do you know what I mean?

328
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:44,230
For me.
This fucker,

329
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,150
like for instance,
I can say,

330
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,890
I think,
I think this kid,

331
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:51,220
you know what if they,
if they go in that direction,

332
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,230
I think they'll be okay.
This one,

333
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:59,300
it's not so much donut.
It's this one against stop.

334
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,700
Yeah.
They do have different personalities

335
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:02,534
like that,
right?

336
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,120
Yeah.
And you've seen like,

337
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,810
it's,
it's almost like a,

338
00:15:05,811 --> 00:15:08,600
I'm gonna let you out of the fence.
Don't listen.

339
00:15:08,601 --> 00:15:12,470
Don't go pass f fucking tree during the
woods.

340
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,070
Walker went nowhere did I not say don't
go into fuck it.

341
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,860
He's in the woods and then they come
back.

342
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:20,680
Oh I'm sorry.
It's,

343
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:26,150
yeah,
I fear this one's going to go some kids

344
00:15:26,151 --> 00:15:29,030
freedom is super intoxicating.
You got to wonder what it is.

345
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:32,480
Is it anything that we set up in those
kids when they were young?

346
00:15:32,481 --> 00:15:36,410
Did we suppress him too much?
And so they just had this intense desire

347
00:15:36,411 --> 00:15:39,680
to be free.
Cause I think there's something to that.

348
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:42,380
This,
this desire to protect someone.

349
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:47,210
It kind of backfires when you're raising
kids in some ways because if you try to

350
00:15:47,211 --> 00:15:48,750
protect him too much,
then they,

351
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,090
they resent you.

352
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:52,820
And then they,
they pushed back the other way.

353
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:57,860
That's why I like girls who have like
really strict parents when it comes to

354
00:15:57,861 --> 00:16:01,880
sex were always like the biggest freaks.
Like we all knew that right?

355
00:16:01,881 --> 00:16:05,630
Catholic school girls worth the biggest
freaks of all time.

356
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:09,710
It wasn't even close.
It was well it was that or like a broken

357
00:16:09,711 --> 00:16:10,940
home,
you know,

358
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,100
no one's around,
you know,

359
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,710
I,
Hey Daddy,

360
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:18,710
well the zone,
any negative pressure,

361
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:21,110
right?
Any negative comes out in one way or

362
00:16:21,111 --> 00:16:23,930
another.
My coming out like you and humor or

363
00:16:23,931 --> 00:16:26,240
might come out of anger.
It might come out in addiction,

364
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:30,200
but any negative pressure that you
experienced as a child,

365
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:33,230
whether it's bullying,
uh,

366
00:16:33,231 --> 00:16:35,390
you know,
going to a new neighborhood,

367
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:38,660
parents break up no attention,
you know,

368
00:16:38,661 --> 00:16:40,820
alcoholism in the family,
whatever the fuck it is,

369
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,600
it just finds its way to the sun.

370
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,420
You know,
your rights.

371
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,920
That's where all our music comes from.
I mean,

372
00:16:48,921 --> 00:16:50,450
that's where all the best stuff comes
from.

373
00:16:50,451 --> 00:16:53,570
It comes from some kind of pain,
some,

374
00:16:53,571 --> 00:16:56,180
some kind of like need to never feel
that pain again,

375
00:16:56,181 --> 00:17:00,170
need to celebrate the happiness of life.
Because you felt that pain and you

376
00:17:00,171 --> 00:17:03,740
understand it and
right.

377
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:05,400
Isn't that what knowing?
How am I?

378
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:06,501
No,
no,

379
00:17:06,501 --> 00:17:07,660
no.
But you try to tense.

380
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:11,450
When did it start with you?
Like once the first time where you saw

381
00:17:11,451 --> 00:17:12,750
something and went,
oh my God,

382
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:14,960
whoa.
With kids.

383
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:18,110
Yeah,
from the jump dude.

384
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:21,380
Just from the jump.
Just from the time they were little tiny

385
00:17:21,381 --> 00:17:22,910
babies,
just start looking at him and he'd go to

386
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,430
these,
this is a little calculating beings.

387
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:29,180
This isn't simply a baby.
Like we have these narrow

388
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:31,220
classifications for human beings.
Like,

389
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,320
oh,
he's an old man.

390
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:34,000
He wouldn't try to fuck her,
you know?

391
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:36,020
Or He's a,
you know,

392
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:38,330
he's a young kid.
He doesn't understand.

393
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:39,860
No,
they fucking understand.

394
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,290
They understand.
They just don't have all the words yet.

395
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:46,340
They understand a lot more than you
think they do and they're just

396
00:17:46,341 --> 00:17:49,710
constantly calculating.
They're constantly taking data.

397
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,180
They're learning

398
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,540
and we're still doing it,
man.

399
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:55,290
I mean,
you and I are better at talking now in

400
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:58,530
our forties and we were in our twenties
you chest,

401
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:02,370
you just brought back.
I feel like I just went to therapy.

402
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,310
Does the basic,
I just found where my anger came while

403
00:18:05,311 --> 00:18:09,810
you were talking,
I was getting visual flashbacks of where

404
00:18:09,811 --> 00:18:12,270
it really started.
My sister,

405
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:14,210
I remember my sister got,
um,

406
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,730
horrible divorce harvest harvest,
really strict.

407
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:19,800
She was getting hit.
Oh right.

408
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:23,040
So I just remember mom,
my mom getting those phone calls and

409
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:23,874
blah,
blah blah,

410
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,740
and did it.
So no,

411
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,620
it's not funny.
But,

412
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:32,670
so I remember going there,
we'd go in the middle of night,

413
00:18:32,671 --> 00:18:34,740
get there and you know,
she'd be bruised.

414
00:18:34,741 --> 00:18:36,960
You could tell she was hit,
which is already,

415
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:41,370
you're fucking traumatized.
You're seven,

416
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:44,910
eight years old
and you just,

417
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:47,040
you witnessed the violence.
And then,

418
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:51,390
um,
I remember the fucker came at the house,

419
00:18:51,391 --> 00:18:52,440
didn't know we were there.

420
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:55,320
And my dad was like,
hey man,

421
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,620
why don't you be a man,
be a man.

422
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,480
And he said,
if you earn all,

423
00:19:00,481 --> 00:19:02,910
man,
I fucking make you eat them words.

424
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,160
I remember my father going,
your dad,

425
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:06,550
and he's trying to get out in my mind,
it's like,

426
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,810
God,
fuck it,

427
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:08,700
and please,
please.

428
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:13,470
But I remember that anger
and then I,

429
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:16,350
that's how I discovered fucking
metallica.

430
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,850
Whoa.
From that,

431
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,040
that exchange,
that aggression.

432
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:24,930
I needed something.
I would go in my basement tear shit.

433
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,670
And so how old,
how old are you at the time?

434
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,820
I tell him off,
I've tended,

435
00:19:27,821 --> 00:19:32,821
I was 14 like do
you know what?

436
00:19:36,991 --> 00:19:41,700
I used to have a lot of internal
arguments like I should have said I

437
00:19:41,701 --> 00:19:45,000
would have is I should have said they
would go on for hours.

438
00:19:45,001 --> 00:19:47,190
I'd be in my fucking car and traffic.
Yo You,

439
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:49,200
if you fucking thought about it,
this word,

440
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:52,240
you know like you don't come come up
with some better thing that you could

441
00:19:52,241 --> 00:19:56,130
have said or some some slicker thing
that you could have said.

442
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:58,170
Well I did.
I still do that though.

443
00:19:58,171 --> 00:20:01,560
You still gave up on it.
I forced it out.

444
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:04,790
We'd it like it's a weed in the garden.
No,

445
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:09,270
I'll do it for a good half hour bathroom
on the road.

446
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,160
Are you kidding me?
Try not to man.

447
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,720
I try not to.
I try to,

448
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:17,810
as much as I can focus my thoughts on
things that are actually beneficial to

449
00:20:18,481 --> 00:20:20,160
me.
So like if it's something like that

450
00:20:20,161 --> 00:20:21,540
where I know what it is,
I know what it is,

451
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:24,480
so I ran into some fucking idiot.
I know what it is.

452
00:20:24,481 --> 00:20:26,160
I'm not going to dwell on it.
Right.

453
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:28,560
You know what I mean?
Just I'm going to move by instead of

454
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:32,400
like making that a part of my life.
I don't want to anybody's goofy behavior

455
00:20:32,401 --> 00:20:34,920
to be a part of my life.
It's so exhausting.

456
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,940
It's exhausting and it's not necessary.
You could figure out a way.

457
00:20:38,941 --> 00:20:41,280
It's an exercise.
It's not easy to do,

458
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,810
but when you get frustrated by someone,
you got to learn how to just concentrate

459
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:48,070
and things that you want to concentrate.
Just don't let the other

460
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:50,500
things in.
And then after a while you get stronger

461
00:20:50,501 --> 00:20:52,660
at it.
It's like a weight or it's like a

462
00:20:52,661 --> 00:20:54,100
muscle.
Rather you lift weights with it,

463
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:57,880
it gets stronger.
So like putting your intention on things

464
00:20:57,881 --> 00:21:01,270
that you actually enjoy instead of
festering on some fucking stupid

465
00:21:01,271 --> 00:21:04,270
argument you might've had with your
girlfriend two months ago or with your

466
00:21:04,271 --> 00:21:09,100
boss last week,
or retard in twitter or someone on

467
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:09,761
twitter.
Yeah.

468
00:21:09,761 --> 00:21:12,760
Or someone you ran into the gas station
and said something fucking stupid you

469
00:21:12,761 --> 00:21:15,460
for no reason and you said I should have
fucking smack that guy.

470
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:16,653
You know,
you just

471
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:24,480
close it up because you
just,

472
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:26,260
you,
yeah.

473
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,870
She can't let,
we can't let those things grow.

474
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:30,610
That's what it is.
When you feed them,

475
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:33,490
they grow,
they do grow and then it goes easier for

476
00:21:33,491 --> 00:21:35,680
them to grow.
It's almost like they've set the fucking

477
00:21:35,681 --> 00:21:36,514
seeds.

478
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:40,210
A matrix of seeds in your head or any
other retarded thought would just

479
00:21:40,211 --> 00:21:43,810
fucking sprout wings and fly away real
quick and don't let them.

480
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:48,460
It happens to most to when you're,
when you're growing like as a person

481
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:50,600
every time.
Every time I think I'm growing like,

482
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:54,940
wow,
I'm expanding in life to bring him down.

483
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:57,760
Show him his weakness.
Yeah.

484
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:00,280
Say he can handle twitter.
That's what happens to me.

485
00:22:00,281 --> 00:22:03,370
I'll get a fucking tweet from,
I don't know who this person is.

486
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:06,790
I don't care who this person is.
I can hear it.

487
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:08,650
It took me a little while to get over
that.

488
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:09,820
You know what,
man?

489
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:12,970
I don't blame them.
I used to blame them and I still make

490
00:22:12,971 --> 00:22:15,340
fun of them,
but I think it's a t,

491
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:20,370
it's a tool.
Twitter is that is too weird and tiered

492
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,150
to,
and it's never been,

493
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,800
it's never existed before.

494
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:28,870
There's never been this ability with an
anonymous name to just be shitty to

495
00:22:28,871 --> 00:22:32,050
someone or just communicate with someone
or even have any kind of contact with

496
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:34,510
someone positive or negative because I
think there's a lot of people out there

497
00:22:34,511 --> 00:22:37,750
that are addicted to the positive too.
I mean like girls,

498
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:41,320
girls on instagram that had taken yoga,
booty pictures and by the way,

499
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:43,240
don't stop.
I'm not saying stop.

500
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:45,020
I'm not saying stop.
All of a sudden.

501
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,920
Just balance it out.
Those pictures are wonderful.

502
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:50,320
Keep them common girls.
I'm not saying don't,

503
00:22:50,321 --> 00:22:52,150
don't take pictures of your well
sculpted,

504
00:22:52,151 --> 00:22:55,420
but you should enjoy the praise that you
get from your Labor in the gym.

505
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:59,140
Not saying that,
but I think definitely people they get

506
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:02,530
that becomes addictive to them.
They start gravitating towards it.

507
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:05,160
Of course they do.
It's like war of the,

508
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,390
it's a war of the mines.

509
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:12,130
Mines all coupon,
20 to fourth episode conspiracy.

510
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,880
It's a conspiracy.
Is that what a conspiracy.

511
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,020
Imagine if they'd created twitter
because they knew.

512
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:17,741
They were like,
look,

513
00:23:17,741 --> 00:23:19,960
we have to figure out where to control
people in the age of information.

514
00:23:19,961 --> 00:23:20,530
Well,
here's the thing.

515
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:22,180
Let them just communicate with each
other freely.

516
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:24,750
They'll start so much conflict.
I'll never be able to deal with us

517
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:28,390
taking over the world every time they
get along.

518
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:32,350
Just tear the pot just a little bit.
Send the fun.

519
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,521
Yeah,
let's keep,

520
00:23:33,521 --> 00:23:36,730
keep race relations and check.
Everything's always going to be chaos.

521
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:41,320
Show them someone getting beaten by an
office out immediately and you have that

522
00:23:41,321 --> 00:23:43,960
tape from 1980 I supposed it up.
Make it look like today.

523
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:46,130
Send

524
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:51,130
the funder
time gang to dad and dad had died.

525
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:55,880
I can introduce some new phrases to get
them upset that me nothing.

526
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,660
I think I'd like to see a debate.
Well,

527
00:24:00,661 --> 00:24:03,800
surely my crowd is angry than yours.
Really?

528
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:07,790
Let's have a bottle off.
Let's limit the words they're allowed to

529
00:24:07,791 --> 00:24:10,430
say freely.
We need more restricted words.

530
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,650
How about retard?
That's an easy one to stop.

531
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:17,110
Let's get rid of retard.
I always wish repulsed by retaught.

532
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:19,340
You know what?
I've always found tranny to be quite

533
00:24:19,341 --> 00:24:21,770
offensive.
Let's make training on the list as well.

534
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,990
Then I'm going to go forward,
but pushing too hard.

535
00:24:23,991 --> 00:24:25,310
They're going to push back.
Oh,

536
00:24:25,311 --> 00:24:27,590
they'll forget to meet Lee.
Oh really?

537
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:32,740
Quick race walk.
Why don't we pass a bill on trend

538
00:24:32,741 --> 00:24:36,830
candace and put it in the limelight
because we all know everybody talks

539
00:24:36,831 --> 00:24:38,990
about that every day.
You know what?

540
00:24:38,991 --> 00:24:41,310
We can never resolve gay marriage.
We need it.

541
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:43,070
It's not peace.
We must move it.

542
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,130
Don't lose the queen.
You lose the queen.

543
00:24:46,131 --> 00:24:48,860
You lose the game.
That's our,

544
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:53,660
Jake matches our queen chess table of a
social construct.

545
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:56,180
What?
I was a little kid,

546
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:59,230
we argued about gay marriage.
When I moved from San Francisco to

547
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:00,970
Florida.
I was probably like,

548
00:25:00,971 --> 00:25:04,900
I think I was 11 years old and I
remember that was a big thing that

549
00:25:04,901 --> 00:25:06,490
people were upset.
They were trying to make gay marriage

550
00:25:06,491 --> 00:25:09,190
then,
so that was like 1970 something.

551
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,660
There's still arguing about it.

552
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:14,360
It's the same cycles every and nobody,
nobody,

553
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:17,480
nobody sees it.
It's weird.

554
00:25:17,481 --> 00:25:19,600
It's crazy.
I got to tell you,

555
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:22,640
you don't.
You get every four years the same thing.

556
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:24,080
Here's,
here's the debates.

557
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:26,120
Gay,
gay marriage,

558
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:29,670
abortion.
Abortion is a big one on a

559
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,300
portion stick.
Trump.

560
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:38,280
How do you feel about killing babies?
Are we cool with it?

561
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:40,880
As long as I don't want,
sorry,

562
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:43,160
I don't get to see it.
Oh No,

563
00:25:43,161 --> 00:25:43,331
no,
no.

564
00:25:43,331 --> 00:25:45,970
You don't say shit.
We put a vacuum cleaner up there.

565
00:25:45,971 --> 00:25:49,180
There's nothing between you and the
tissue at all.

566
00:25:49,181 --> 00:25:51,070
You don't see anything.
Okay,

567
00:25:51,071 --> 00:25:52,690
cool.
As long as I don't see it.

568
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,110
Well,
how big do they get?

569
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,960
How big do they get before they suck
them out of there?

570
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:58,630
Yeah,
they can get pretty big.

571
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,250
Don't he wants to have this
conversation.

572
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:05,610
Nobody wants coming inside.
People feel so good that nobody wants to

573
00:26:06,071 --> 00:26:07,900
have this conversation.
Everyone's like,

574
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:09,310
let's,
let's just keep it around.

575
00:26:09,311 --> 00:26:13,360
Just keep it around,
stop describing it and the uncomfortable

576
00:26:13,361 --> 00:26:15,910
way,
that's like I'm describing it.

577
00:26:15,911 --> 00:26:20,911
It is like fucking mellow and bland and
factual way as possible and it's

578
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:22,960
uncomfortable.

579
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,130
It's fuck like what abortion actually is
and I'm not saying that you shouldn't be

580
00:26:27,131 --> 00:26:29,170
able to do it.
I'm a hundred percent pro choice.

581
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:32,560
I'm 100% a woman has a right to do
whatever she wants with her body and I

582
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:34,720
definitely don't think a man should be
able to tell you what to do with your

583
00:26:34,721 --> 00:26:37,540
body.
100% but the end of the day,

584
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,740
that's a little baby and you're using a
vacuum to suck it out of your body.

585
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:43,770
Like it's odd,
but it,

586
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,280
but it's not odd.
It's not like a judgment because I agree

587
00:26:47,281 --> 00:26:48,780
with it.
I think he should be able to do it.

588
00:26:48,781 --> 00:26:51,480
But isn't there an up to a point because
it's like,

589
00:26:51,481 --> 00:26:54,540
it's like three cells,
like it was enough cells to fit on the

590
00:26:54,541 --> 00:26:57,540
very tip of a pin and it just gets
sucked out of the vacuum.

591
00:26:57,570 --> 00:26:59,400
Okay.
I don't really see the issue.

592
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,160
You know,
if you're,

593
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:04,400
if you're like a tribal guy in the
woods,

594
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:07,460
are guys,
get the girl pregnant,

595
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:12,710
they realize we're not going to be able
to fucking before this one and you're

596
00:27:12,711 --> 00:27:17,030
Charlie's wife or boot booze wife,
we got to get rid of.

597
00:27:17,031 --> 00:27:19,520
You can't tell me they don't.
They're not eating berries or

598
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:24,640
fucking running hard into a tray.
So what I mean like I have a abortion

599
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:34,270
stomped at this angle and this is where
you run.

600
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:38,690
If the calming your body and you don't
want to baby,

601
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:46,420
you run towards the abortion had dumb
fucking take one right in the gut.

602
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:52,340
It's like a perfectly shaped tree.
God Damn.

603
00:27:52,341 --> 00:27:52,941
Yeah,
for sure.

604
00:27:52,941 --> 00:27:55,370
Somebody must've figured out somewhere
along the line there's gotta be a way to

605
00:27:55,371 --> 00:27:58,460
stop this fucking kid.
But the point is

606
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:05,670
you're a sex edge that that's,
if I had that as sex education in fifth

607
00:28:06,521 --> 00:28:08,530
grade,
I would've thought everything a lot

608
00:28:08,531 --> 00:28:09,520
differently.
My head,

609
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,280
you come in and describe it all.
Listen,

610
00:28:12,281 --> 00:28:15,280
I know you guys getting into it and you
know,

611
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,710
these are the risks.
And you said everything you just said

612
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:22,330
like wow,
I would have changed my whole

613
00:28:22,331 --> 00:28:25,000
perspective on moving forward.
Well,

614
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:28,440
you know the egg,
the egg shoots into this.

615
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:31,360
That's what they teach you.
And so the teaching nonsense coming and

616
00:28:31,361 --> 00:28:34,680
people feels awesome and there's a
reason for that nature.

617
00:28:34,681 --> 00:28:37,870
Just trying to get you to make more
people because nature is still the same

618
00:28:37,871 --> 00:28:41,290
setup that was around when we died real
young when there wasn't that many of us.

619
00:28:41,291 --> 00:28:43,120
We could,
you could wipe out some,

620
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:45,460
you know,
we were shitting in the street so people

621
00:28:45,461 --> 00:28:47,740
were getting plague and how they'd have
rats,

622
00:28:47,741 --> 00:28:52,741
they would carry these diseases and
fleas and not deaf.

623
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:55,750
Fought like a gene off from tossing her
own feces.

624
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,670
A gene off.
Yeah.

625
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,360
Yeah.
So why do we have to come a lot?

626
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:04,210
I've got to make a lot of people just to
keep the fucking party rolling.

627
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,540
And I think that's one of the things
that's going on today when you're seeing

628
00:29:07,541 --> 00:29:10,870
people become more of like,
a lot of men are gravitating towards

629
00:29:10,871 --> 00:29:12,070
being more feminine.

630
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:15,850
And then you hear the phrases like toxic
masculinity,

631
00:29:15,851 --> 00:29:18,490
like phrases that we never heard.
We were young that almost like

632
00:29:18,491 --> 00:29:22,660
denigrates the concept of masculinity
and some sort of a weird abstract way.

633
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,940
But I think it's because we realize,
hey,

634
00:29:24,941 --> 00:29:28,360
we don't need to fuck as much anymore.
We don't need to go to war as much

635
00:29:28,361 --> 00:29:29,320
anymore.
Like,

636
00:29:29,321 --> 00:29:31,600
like we're,
we're progressing into some sort of a

637
00:29:31,601 --> 00:29:35,350
digital universe that we're moving into
and it's not going her car,

638
00:29:35,351 --> 00:29:38,200
so much chimp meat,
you know,

639
00:29:38,201 --> 00:29:42,250
so much chaos in blood.
So I as a culture,

640
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:46,000
people were sort of moving away.
That's why when something like the UFC

641
00:29:46,001 --> 00:29:48,940
comes around or,
or heavy metal or something,

642
00:29:48,941 --> 00:29:53,941
like something just openly aggressive,
like guys like you or I will go,

643
00:29:54,671 --> 00:29:59,671
yeah,
let me be me.

644
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,630
Then me being me.

645
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:06,820
Oh my God,
I've trying to drag me to the future.

646
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:10,870
That should be politics.
That should be,

647
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:15,100
I would see that as politics one day.
Some guy who was in the room,

648
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:18,730
you want to be the governor,
guess he's in the ring summit.

649
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:21,850
There was a fucking photo that I took
off of a twitter today.

650
00:30:21,851 --> 00:30:24,250
I think somebody put it up,
I'll find out who put it up.

651
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:26,170
Um,
but it was a,

652
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,680
just a little sign that was outside
someplace in Texas that said,

653
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:32,080
uh,
instead of having a president,

654
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:34,930
why don't we just all agree really hard
to be cool.

655
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:40,420
And uh,
and I saw that.

656
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:40,981
I was like,
what?

657
00:30:40,981 --> 00:30:44,500
That's so that's so fucking simple,
but isn't that going to be what it is

658
00:30:44,501 --> 00:30:47,200
one day?
Like isn't it kind of moving into that

659
00:30:47,201 --> 00:30:49,690
sort of a direction?
Isn't that what going to be one day?

660
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:51,580
I hope so.
Just everybody be cool.

661
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:54,280
Just relax.
I think that's what's we're,

662
00:30:54,281 --> 00:30:57,900
we're moving away from all of the
fucking,

663
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:02,940
the weird base physical needs that we
constantly have to feed.

664
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:06,310
Right.
Moving away from those.

665
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:11,970
But don't you think whoever is aware of
that anticipates that

666
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:17,110
and they're already counteract during
you mean though?

667
00:31:17,111 --> 00:31:20,890
Like the powers that be the pal is that
became the the evil cabal

668
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,920
and an old room.
Know what I mean?

669
00:31:26,921 --> 00:31:29,410
Books,
leather bound books in the wall.

670
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:31,540
If you have a leather bound book,
you're an asshole.

671
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:33,370
How about that?
And if you're one of those guys with a

672
00:31:33,371 --> 00:31:37,660
bunch of books behind you,
Polish tradition in gold,

673
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:42,400
fleeting pleading,
I don't think they can manipulate it

674
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:45,700
nearly as much as we think they can.
I think they definitely manipulate the

675
00:31:45,701 --> 00:31:49,720
things they can and I think this world
has gotten so out of hand that it's on

676
00:31:49,721 --> 00:31:52,390
its own.
It's working on some kind of crazy

677
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:57,570
instinctual momentum towards progress.
I think those old dudes for sure killed

678
00:31:58,811 --> 00:32:02,620
Kennedy for sure.
I've seen the arguments for,

679
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:07,740
I've seen the arguments against somebody
killed Kennedy and it wasn't just Lee

680
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,270
Harvey Oswald to,
everybody's got this either or thing.

681
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,910
You know [inaudible] Harvey Oswald acted
alone?

682
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:15,400
I don't think so.
I think he's definitely was in on it

683
00:32:15,401 --> 00:32:17,500
though.
I think there's a gang of people in on

684
00:32:17,501 --> 00:32:18,880
it.
I think he was one of the people that

685
00:32:18,881 --> 00:32:22,540
was in on it.
It's highly likely that Lee Harvey

686
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:27,430
Oswald was out of his fucking mind.
Crazy asshole working for the government

687
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:30,250
doing some weird shit and Russia comes
back over here.

688
00:32:30,251 --> 00:32:33,520
Mary's a Russian lady.
There's all sorts of wackiness to it,

689
00:32:33,521 --> 00:32:35,960
but when,
okay,

690
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:37,990
good opposite.
I'm just rambling,

691
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,530
but what is all that

692
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:44,450
that that was back in the 60s that's
what is all that manipulation.

693
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:47,810
So I'm going to [inaudible] and they
were trying to figure out how to retain

694
00:32:47,811 --> 00:32:50,460
control.
Kennedy wanted to break up better

695
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,530
reserve.
Oh,

696
00:32:51,531 --> 00:32:52,610
a bunch of people.
First of all,

697
00:32:52,611 --> 00:32:56,690
he wanted to get rid of the CIA.
He wanted to get rid of the NSA.

698
00:32:56,691 --> 00:32:58,430
He wanted to get rid of a bunch of
agencies.

699
00:32:58,431 --> 00:33:00,440
Do the CIA or the NSA,
one of those.

700
00:33:00,441 --> 00:33:03,980
He wanted to dissolve.
He wanted to get rid of the Internal

701
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,030
Revenue Service.
He wanted to get rid of the federal

702
00:33:05,031 --> 00:33:08,090
bank.
Like Kennedy had some radical ideas.

703
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:12,290
He wanted to change a lot of things
about the way the world was.

704
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:16,640
And he also wanted posting and and mass.
Did you ever read,

705
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:19,760
no one ever hurt?
Did you ever hear the whole speech?

706
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,150
But then the,
the famous one he did.

707
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,190
It's always the end asked.

708
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:28,880
Not that thing,
but did you ever hear the whole speech?

709
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:32,470
I'm sure I did everything.
What you're saying he was a bad mother

710
00:33:32,471 --> 00:33:33,304
fucker,
dude.

711
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,620
He was little.
He was saying like,

712
00:33:34,621 --> 00:33:35,870
you know,
hey listen,

713
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:39,080
there's enough means we can all get
along.

714
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:41,690
Oh Geez.
Just really have a fucking hippie yet.

715
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:44,660
Did you ever hear the stuff that he said
about secret societies?

716
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:46,190
No,
dude,

717
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:50,180
play this cause this is from that stuff.
I know.

718
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:52,280
I'm not saying you can't know.
Look,

719
00:33:52,281 --> 00:33:53,450
I've,
I believe her dope.

720
00:33:53,451 --> 00:33:55,310
My friend Eddie Bravo,
who I love to death.

721
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:57,980
He loves every single one of them.
Every conspiracy that comes along,

722
00:33:57,981 --> 00:33:59,600
he dives into it.
Fucking hook,

723
00:33:59,601 --> 00:34:00,201
line,
sinker.

724
00:34:00,201 --> 00:34:03,890
He loves them.
I love their funding and fund to fund

725
00:34:03,891 --> 00:34:08,090
because he had the dads get my little
house in my little lawn and to Vince

726
00:34:08,091 --> 00:34:09,260
foster.
Look it up.

727
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:16,100
Did you ever hear about that guy who is
running drugs through MENA,

728
00:34:16,101 --> 00:34:18,560
Arkansas gay.
He's in then move.

729
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:19,423
Yeah.
Yeah.

730
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:22,250
They would trap and coke at a place.
It was barry seal's.

731
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:27,110
He's working for the CIA,
dropping coke out of planes and they

732
00:34:27,111 --> 00:34:28,460
caught these kids,
found it.

733
00:34:28,461 --> 00:34:31,820
They killed the kids.
Was that the game show guy?

734
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:33,103
No,
baby.

735
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:36,560
Oh yeah.
Chuck Barris.

736
00:34:36,561 --> 00:34:37,400
Yeah.
Yes.

737
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,110
No,
Don buress is our friend.

738
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:40,370
It's not,
what was his name?

739
00:34:40,371 --> 00:34:42,400
Did they make a movie about that guy?
Yeah.

740
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:46,160
Chuck Barris.
Yeah.

741
00:34:46,161 --> 00:34:47,330
It was kind of like a,
uh,

742
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:50,480
like a fake movie,
but pretending that he was at a hitman

743
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,373
or something.
Yeah.

744
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:52,910
I fell asleep.
Watch at once.

745
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:56,120
It's one of those movies.
So you know,

746
00:34:56,121 --> 00:34:58,610
I would get exhausted with this talk is
to be really,

747
00:34:58,611 --> 00:35:02,450
really
paranoid.

748
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:03,840
Hey,
let's listen to the heroin.

749
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:05,990
I just did you go?
What do you do about all that?

750
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,810
Good,
longer speech.

751
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:09,831
Good.
Perfect.

752
00:35:09,831 --> 00:35:11,900
The shorter version won't want to hear.
I know.

753
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:12,920
It's exhausting,
dude.

754
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:14,630
This'll get off the shit out of you.

755
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:21,270
Ladies and gentlemen,
the very word secrecy is repugnant in a

756
00:35:21,461 --> 00:35:26,461
free and open society and we are as a
people inherently and historically

757
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:33,300
opposed to secret societies to secret
oaths and a secret proceedings.

758
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:39,240
We decided long ago that the dangers,
excessive and unwarranted concealment of

759
00:35:40,321 --> 00:35:45,321
pertinent facts far outweigh the dangers
which are cited to justify it.

760
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:50,280
Even today,
there is little value in opposing the

761
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:55,140
threat of a closed society by imitating
its arbitrary restrictions.

762
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:59,520
Even today,
there is little value in ensuring the

763
00:35:59,521 --> 00:36:04,521
survival of our nation if our traditions
do not survive with it and there is very

764
00:36:05,911 --> 00:36:10,911
grave danger that an announced need for
increased security will be seized upon

765
00:36:12,511 --> 00:36:17,511
by those anxious to expand its meaning
to the very limits of official census

766
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:22,690
ship and concealment that I do not
intend to permit to the extent that it's

767
00:36:22,921 --> 00:36:26,910
in my control and no official of my
administration,

768
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:31,940
whether his rank is high or low,
civilian or military should interpret my

769
00:36:32,221 --> 00:36:32,580
words.

770
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:35,880
He had a night as an excuse to sense of
the news,

771
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:41,360
to stifle dissent,
to cover up our mistakes or to withhold

772
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:46,491
from the press and the public the facts
they deserve to know for we are opposed

773
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:52,371
around the world by a monolithic and
ruthless conspiracy that relies

774
00:36:53,191 --> 00:36:58,191
primarily on Kubot means for expanding
its sphere of influence on infiltration

775
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:05,030
instead of invasion on severity one
instead of elections on intimidation

776
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:11,690
instead of free choice on guerrillas by
night instead of armies by day.

777
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:17,900
It is a system which has conscripted
vast human and material resources into

778
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:24,111
the building of a tightly knit,
highly efficient machine that combines

779
00:37:24,151 --> 00:37:27,480
military,
diplomatic intelligence,

780
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:29,370
economic,
scientific

781
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,250
and politically was about a
motherfucker.

782
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:34,820
We could just listen to that whole
speech and just bail on this podcast.

783
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:39,850
But
what does everyone give the trophy to?

784
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:45,010
What does it say on every poster?
What does he most famous for?

785
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:50,120
Not that's all they took was that last
end of the speech.

786
00:37:50,121 --> 00:37:54,530
You said ask not what your country,
you didn't who remain,

787
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:58,400
who that all should have been on it.
So that is also a part of the same

788
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:02,290
speech is that same spectrum,
same garden

789
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:05,450
that I can,
I'm not going to act like I'm a

790
00:38:05,451 --> 00:38:08,450
historian here.
It is the same guy who said that and you

791
00:38:08,451 --> 00:38:09,980
never hear that.
Spend some shows here.

792
00:38:09,981 --> 00:38:12,190
The other part can be never heard that
said that.

793
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:15,110
You know,
that's the sickest speech I've ever

794
00:38:15,111 --> 00:38:18,080
heard by any president ever.
Then again,

795
00:38:18,081 --> 00:38:19,730
I don't listen to anything.
I'm a two minutes in,

796
00:38:19,731 --> 00:38:22,850
I'm out.
Well it's hard to listen to them because

797
00:38:22,851 --> 00:38:24,560
you know it's horseshit.
It's horse shit.

798
00:38:24,561 --> 00:38:27,770
And they all talk like presidents,
you know what I'm saying?

799
00:38:27,771 --> 00:38:31,280
Like they don't just talk to you,
they'll talk to you in this.

800
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,440
Like there's a,
there's like a pattern there.

801
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:36,070
They're locked into that.
You can't read

802
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:41,730
when someone talks to you as if you were
a person in the audience.

803
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,520
You know what I mean?
Like there's a pattern and the way he's

804
00:38:45,521 --> 00:38:48,280
talking,
they don't reveal much about their

805
00:38:48,281 --> 00:38:50,950
actual motions.
They put on a mask you put on,

806
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:53,080
when you do a speech,
like a pelt politician,

807
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:58,120
you're putting on a verbal mask and
you're not allowing people to see much

808
00:38:58,121 --> 00:39:00,370
of you.
That's why when we see a little bit,

809
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:05,230
you know like when Hillary Clinton's
shrieks and people like why,

810
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,840
why is everybody concentrating on it?
Because you're getting to see a little

811
00:39:07,841 --> 00:39:08,770
bit of her.
We,

812
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,510
you see a little bit of her through the
mask,

813
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:13,090
right?
She's got this two inch thick political

814
00:39:13,091 --> 00:39:18,091
mask that she's put coats of paint that
have now hit two inches thick from all

815
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,570
the years of doing this.
So when you hear a shriek,

816
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:27,820
it's no different than if you watch a
third grader and a play.

817
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:29,680
Right.
When those kids come out,

818
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:32,390
it's the same monotone.
Uh,

819
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:34,150
yeah,
that they don't know their lives.

820
00:39:34,151 --> 00:39:36,460
They don't care about their lines.
When I,

821
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:40,240
when I watched the politicians talk,
it's no different or paint.

822
00:39:40,241 --> 00:39:44,590
It's more fucking painful to watch that.
Then my third graders,

823
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:48,070
horrifying play every single year they
do well.

824
00:39:48,071 --> 00:39:50,560
That's one of the things that bummed me
out the most about Obama.

825
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:54,220
When I first saw him,
when he was first in office,

826
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:55,810
when he was first running for president,
I was like,

827
00:39:55,811 --> 00:39:57,490
this guy is going to be like a new
Kennedy.

828
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:02,410
Like this guy's going to be like this
guy who changes everything with the way

829
00:40:02,411 --> 00:40:04,630
he talks and the policies that he
creates.

830
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:09,520
He's a young articulate,
I mean he's essentially close to our

831
00:40:09,521 --> 00:40:11,200
age.
He's like three years older than us.

832
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:13,150
He's,
he grew up in our age,

833
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:14,110
grew up in our era.

834
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:19,440
But don't you think
he's putting that situation somewhere

835
00:40:21,071 --> 00:40:22,660
along the line to like,
listen,

836
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:23,760
yeah.
Nice.

837
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:29,290
You get to have a nice little run here.
But there's some other rules you need to

838
00:40:29,291 --> 00:40:31,000
abide by.
You understand?

839
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:34,080
I can I say that with southern accent
southern as you know,

840
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,170
I pitch southern.
It just,

841
00:40:35,171 --> 00:40:40,171
it sounded scary but meaner and it
scares me more if a northerner gives me

842
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:42,740
a threat.
Uh,

843
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:45,880
for some reason southern or scares me
more cause I really,

844
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:47,830
it's more medicine that,
you know,

845
00:40:47,831 --> 00:40:49,870
it was a burt reynolds movie.
Which one?

846
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:53,500
The fuck was that movie.
And then when the swamp as first movie

847
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:56,590
deliverance,
deliverance squeal like a pig.

848
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:59,890
Remember that scary fuck traumatized.
That was our,

849
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:03,430
when people grew up in the east coast or
the in the northeast,

850
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:05,520
when you're in,
you heard those movies,

851
00:41:05,521 --> 00:41:06,490
you saw those movies around there.

852
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:09,670
That was like our introduction to look
scary southern people.

853
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:13,000
Oh,
so what do you think Obama,

854
00:41:13,001 --> 00:41:15,250
would you want Obama come on dude.
I thought I was,

855
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:17,140
I thought it,
I was looking at the future.

856
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,660
I thought it was looking at someone who
was going to change everything.

857
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:20,950
I thought,
I'm like,

858
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:23,830
here's this guy who's like everything we
always wanted.

859
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:28,210
He was a Bush was like this guy who was
almost anti intellectual in a way.

860
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,630
It seemed like he would take these like
real shortcuts to the way he thought and

861
00:41:31,631 --> 00:41:34,670
the way he expressed himself.
Real obvious shortcuts.

862
00:41:34,671 --> 00:41:38,360
It wasn't,
he didn't express himself in a way where

863
00:41:38,361 --> 00:41:41,840
he was trying to get really intelligent
people to say,

864
00:41:41,841 --> 00:41:44,090
okay,
this guy is well thought out when he was

865
00:41:44,091 --> 00:41:48,020
doing was he was expressing himself in a
way where he was trying to get like

866
00:41:48,021 --> 00:41:50,990
really dumb people to think he's one of
them.

867
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:53,000
And there's two different kinds of
people.

868
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:53,421
You know,
there's,

869
00:41:53,421 --> 00:41:56,330
there's someone like Obama when he was
running for office.

870
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:57,770
Well,
here's a good,

871
00:41:57,770 --> 00:41:59,990
here's a good example,
Ron Paul's great example,

872
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:03,590
right?
Ron Paul is obviously very intelligent

873
00:42:03,830 --> 00:42:08,830
and he speaks to both the intelligent
people and talk to the people that might

874
00:42:08,931 --> 00:42:12,980
not understand all the concepts that
he's discussing when it comes to big

875
00:42:12,981 --> 00:42:17,870
government or intervention and foreign
policy intervention intervening in a

876
00:42:17,871 --> 00:42:20,180
foreign countries.
When he does it,

877
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:25,210
it's like very clear and concise and
particularly well chosen words.

878
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:30,830
So Obama was that guy like to me it's
like Obama was like the opposite of the

879
00:42:30,831 --> 00:42:33,620
guy who was appealing to her dumb
people.

880
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:34,731
Obama,
you know,

881
00:42:34,731 --> 00:42:37,970
he's appealing towards Obama was
appealing towards youth and hope,

882
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,130
you know,
hope and change was like the big part of

883
00:42:40,131 --> 00:42:42,410
the uh,
well all these years later,

884
00:42:42,830 --> 00:42:45,050
what's,
what's really changed that much joe?

885
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,420
Just think about this though.
Okay.

886
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:49,040
All right.
You get to that part.

887
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,710
I get it.
I'm with you 1000%,

888
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:55,490
but,
but the realistic,

889
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:58,100
like a realistic view,
don't you think?

890
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,830
Where you look at every great hero and
there's that fear of death.

891
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:04,664
Like,
oh,

892
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:06,700
I like salmon.
These concepts.

893
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:10,640
You talking about the key kids.
Nice kids look real nice over there.

894
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:14,840
So he wanted to change.
It's awesome.

895
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,590
Um,
let me show you a little video of Mr

896
00:43:18,591 --> 00:43:23,591
Kennedy's last guy had that big dump
fucking speech to remember John Lennon.

897
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:25,940
Wasn't he cute?
Huh?

898
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:29,280
Do you think they killed?
Imagine all they send Dad Wacko.

899
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:31,160
Oh,
I fucking Wacko.

900
00:43:31,161 --> 00:43:36,050
She son of a bitch.
But isn't it more likely that people are

901
00:43:36,051 --> 00:43:38,900
obsessed with John Lennon?
Because these ladies are amazing

902
00:43:38,901 --> 00:43:41,090
artists.
Could be like that little girl that got

903
00:43:41,091 --> 00:43:43,190
shot in Florida last week.
Horrifying.

904
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,810
Horrifying.
But do you think that she was a part of

905
00:43:44,811 --> 00:43:45,644
the Illuminati?

906
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:49,080
Was there like some sort of a plan to
stop her and her,

907
00:43:49,090 --> 00:43:51,970
her message of freedom or was it just
crazy?

908
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:52,530
No.
Anything.

909
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:55,310
If it wasn't in love with her,
just a young girl was the singer I went

910
00:43:55,311 --> 00:43:56,870
for what I'm saying?
Yeah,

911
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,550
most likely it could be crazy.
Fuck.

912
00:43:58,551 --> 00:44:03,350
I know that a lot of crazy fucks.
I'm just saying I th I think everyone

913
00:44:03,351 --> 00:44:05,650
wanted that from any politician.
Right.

914
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:07,400
But the mid,
that politician,

915
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:08,230
you can't,
you,

916
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:11,960
you can't denied it.
The first guy to actually has free reign

917
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,730
and he faked everyone out and he got to
that point.

918
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:22,160
It's gotta be nearly impossible to go
listen if they shut off the phone,

919
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:26,570
if they shut all communication down
right now it's cause they don't like

920
00:44:26,571 --> 00:44:27,920
what I'm saying.
Boom.

921
00:44:27,921 --> 00:44:31,610
Until you have that brutal honesty.
Could you imagine going to happen?

922
00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:36,750
Hero man,
what'd he gets out of office and tells

923
00:44:36,751 --> 00:44:39,780
everybody exact what the fuck happened.
Did he say that when he was president?

924
00:44:39,781 --> 00:44:40,770
Because it would kill us kids.

925
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:41,833
Yeah.

926
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:44,770
Oh,
no one's very sick.

927
00:44:46,290 --> 00:44:48,030
This is terrible.
The government,

928
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:49,980
they're watching,
they're listening to everything we say.

929
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,630
The NSA,
they recorded.

930
00:44:51,631 --> 00:44:53,670
Isn't that really funny?
They're blower watching me.

931
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:55,710
Yeah.
What are you gonna do different?

932
00:44:55,711 --> 00:44:56,870
Really?
Board watch me.

933
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:59,490
Here he goes again.
Another fucking speech.

934
00:44:59,491 --> 00:45:01,110
She was 17 year olds.
This another thing,

935
00:45:01,111 --> 00:45:04,440
people think that there's this like
gigantic conspiracy to watch over

936
00:45:04,441 --> 00:45:05,760
everybody.
And I'm going to bring up the,

937
00:45:05,761 --> 00:45:07,560
uh,
the guy who broke into the White House.

938
00:45:08,070 --> 00:45:09,910
You know,
the story broke in the White House and

939
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:13,200
no guy broke in the White House,
got arrested a couple months before.

940
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:14,970
You know,
the only two people have ever broken

941
00:45:14,971 --> 00:45:16,740
into why not?
I do remember this one was from like

942
00:45:16,741 --> 00:45:18,870
1912.
A guy broke in.

943
00:45:18,871 --> 00:45:22,770
They tackle them quick.
This one was from a year and a half ago

944
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:25,710
and the guy who broke in,
he got arrested,

945
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:29,010
I think it was in an in September,
but he got,

946
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,640
he got pulled over in July with four
rifles,

947
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:37,820
two handguns and a fucking machete in
his car plus a map of Washington with an

948
00:45:39,211 --> 00:45:41,220
x where the fucking White House is.

949
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:46,680
So he gets pulled over with that two
months before he winds up breaking into

950
00:45:46,681 --> 00:45:50,400
the White House.
Like this is how poorly they're watching

951
00:45:50,401 --> 00:45:53,340
us.
Like this idea that there's this a bunch

952
00:45:53,341 --> 00:45:56,760
of evil geniuses that are watching 300
million people's every moves.

953
00:45:56,761 --> 00:45:59,580
It's ridiculous.
They can't watch anything.

954
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:02,520
There's not enough people.
And the people that are watching,

955
00:46:02,521 --> 00:46:04,200
they don't give a fuck.
They want to go home.

956
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:07,410
Right.
The guy broke into the White House and

957
00:46:07,411 --> 00:46:10,560
one of the things that he was doing,
he ran across the lawn and the guy who

958
00:46:10,561 --> 00:46:14,220
was supposed to be watching the dogs
took his earpiece out cause he was

959
00:46:14,221 --> 00:46:16,500
talking to his girlfriend on cell phone.
Wow.

960
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:18,410
He had a second radio.
They keep it back up.

961
00:46:18,411 --> 00:46:20,040
Right.
Oh he forgot that in his locker.

962
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:23,010
This is the kind of people that are
guarding the world.

963
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:27,330
So like this idea that there's like
these super geniuses that are in control

964
00:46:27,331 --> 00:46:30,930
of every move and they hired a hit man
and hypnotized him.

965
00:46:30,930 --> 00:46:33,950
Manchurian candidate style.
No are you?

966
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:38,400
I was talking to my girlfriend hard.
It would be to talk someone into killing

967
00:46:38,401 --> 00:46:41,790
someone for you and then getting shot
and killed himself or getting locked up

968
00:46:41,791 --> 00:46:43,860
in jail for the rest of her life to how
fucking hard.

969
00:46:43,861 --> 00:46:48,030
That would be really hard.
It would be almost impossible to count

970
00:46:48,031 --> 00:46:51,030
on that kind of pulling it off to like,
cause you would have to get someone

971
00:46:51,031 --> 00:46:53,430
who's probably never killed somebody
before and that's going to be their

972
00:46:53,431 --> 00:46:56,040
first killing.
You're going to go kill John Lennon and

973
00:46:56,041 --> 00:46:57,540
then get locked up in jail for the rest
of the life.

974
00:46:57,541 --> 00:46:59,010
You convince this guy's going to do
this.

975
00:46:59,490 --> 00:47:00,780
Like how are you going to get this guy
to do this?

976
00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:04,980
Most of them are going to fuck it up.
Like how we're all the fuck ups,

977
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:05,941
you know?
How come,

978
00:47:05,941 --> 00:47:09,330
how come a bunch of people haven't
fucked up and missed and not pulled it

979
00:47:09,331 --> 00:47:11,230
off?
Now they're always successful because

980
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:14,880
there are just fucking crazy people.
They're just fucking crazy people.

981
00:47:14,910 --> 00:47:19,350
I agree for all those ones that we think
there's some grand conspiracy,

982
00:47:19,351 --> 00:47:23,280
it's much more likely that people
retarded way more could be,

983
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:28,030
but there's a few fucking real ones like
that Kennedy speech where he must,

984
00:47:28,031 --> 00:47:31,300
didn't know he was in deep.
He must have known,

985
00:47:31,330 --> 00:47:35,340
he knew about Scotland bones and all
those crazy little fraternities and

986
00:47:35,341 --> 00:47:39,370
those guys belong to where they fuck
each other and take polaroids and

987
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:42,010
blackmail each other for the rest of
their lives.

988
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:48,490
If we don't go to war with Libya,
certain cache of photos won't be

989
00:47:48,491 --> 00:47:50,890
released to the press,
you know?

990
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:53,680
Right.
It's really that simple.

991
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:57,700
It probably probably compromise them
when they're young in some sort of a

992
00:47:57,701 --> 00:48:02,701
weird way and get them to do gay stuff
probably.

993
00:48:03,581 --> 00:48:04,920
Right.
I mean,

994
00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:07,070
look,
I have no clue if you're running,

995
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:08,950
Huh?
If she were funded like one of those

996
00:48:08,951 --> 00:48:10,240
Yale clubs.
Yeah.

997
00:48:10,330 --> 00:48:13,100
That's the best way to shut them all up.
But what he it,

998
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:14,110
well,
of course.

999
00:48:14,290 --> 00:48:15,430
Yeah.
It get some gay porn on them,

1000
00:48:17,650 --> 00:48:18,850
right?
Of course.

1001
00:48:18,851 --> 00:48:23,851
And it starts your religion,
16 millimeter and some dark dungeon in

1002
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:27,700
Connecticut
this year,

1003
00:48:27,701 --> 00:48:28,534
right?
Charlie?

1004
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:33,580
They got the fraternity logo on what's
the skull and bones logo look like?

1005
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:36,910
So fucking cool.
Something death metal,

1006
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:44,560
maybe even all the skull and bones shit
came out of the same pressure.

1007
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:46,450
You know,
when you think of it then all those

1008
00:48:46,451 --> 00:48:49,000
rich,
rich guys that are rich fucking dads who

1009
00:48:49,001 --> 00:48:52,120
aren't paying attention to them and
they're going to boarding schools it.

1010
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:53,010
Oh,
look at it.

1011
00:48:53,010 --> 00:48:54,460
Ooh,
you can't,

1012
00:48:54,490 --> 00:48:56,890
whatever you do,
don't make a t shirt with that on it

1013
00:48:56,891 --> 00:48:58,630
with your name on it.
People would be so upset.

1014
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:01,060
So what is,
I don't even know what this is.

1015
00:49:01,330 --> 00:49:04,930
Is this cell phones?
I butcher.

1016
00:49:04,931 --> 00:49:06,970
It would be here too long.
I butcher it too.

1017
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,340
It's,
it's a fraternity or a group that,

1018
00:49:09,341 --> 00:49:11,560
uh,
a lot of former presidents belonged to.

1019
00:49:11,561 --> 00:49:15,610
Like John Kerry belonged to it and
Bush and,

1020
00:49:16,050 --> 00:49:18,130
uh,
it's just a Yale fraternity,

1021
00:49:18,131 --> 00:49:21,520
like our club.
A secret club of many,

1022
00:49:21,521 --> 00:49:25,000
many people who wind up being leaders in
the free world.

1023
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:25,421
Well,
yeah,

1024
00:49:25,421 --> 00:49:27,280
pull it up.
So I stopped butchering it,

1025
00:49:29,230 --> 00:49:32,080
but it's one of those things that people
point to when they look at evidence.

1026
00:49:32,410 --> 00:49:35,710
The 15 what does it say?
The 15 most powerful what members of

1027
00:49:35,711 --> 00:49:38,200
skull and bones,
the most famous secret society and

1028
00:49:38,201 --> 00:49:40,600
America,
skull and bones was cofounded Yale in

1029
00:49:40,601 --> 00:49:43,510
1832 by the father of a future
president.

1030
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:47,530
And it's come to signify everything that
attracts and repulses the public about

1031
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:52,510
and quotes the elite.
Rumor has it that Yale Junior class

1032
00:49:52,511 --> 00:49:56,080
members are tapped for membership each
fall by some measure of leadership,

1033
00:49:56,230 --> 00:49:59,800
influence and breeding among the
business titans,

1034
00:49:59,801 --> 00:50:01,780
poets,
politicians in three us,

1035
00:50:01,781 --> 00:50:03,250
presidents that are rumored to be
members.

1036
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:07,480
We've picked out our honor roll poets.
What fucking poets and what they're

1037
00:50:07,481 --> 00:50:09,100
talking to other ass.
That's one of the things.

1038
00:50:09,101 --> 00:50:10,480
It sounds good.
Wow.

1039
00:50:10,481 --> 00:50:11,800
Look at this.
Look at the all the members.

1040
00:50:11,801 --> 00:50:16,690
William Howard Taft Clay class of 1878,
a former president,

1041
00:50:17,110 --> 00:50:21,580
uh,
Amos Alonzo stagg class of 1888 Yale's

1042
00:50:21,581 --> 00:50:23,200
greatest football player.
What did he do?

1043
00:50:23,790 --> 00:50:25,720
A bunch of uh,
sports stuff.

1044
00:50:26,730 --> 00:50:27,980
Okay.
Uh,

1045
00:50:27,981 --> 00:50:30,170
sports stuff back for black people
figured out sports.

1046
00:50:30,530 --> 00:50:32,750
I don't count those.
I really don't.

1047
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:37,310
When you playing when Lebron James was
alive?

1048
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:39,620
No.
You're barely playing basketball.

1049
00:50:39,650 --> 00:50:42,290
Okay.
William Avril Herrmann.

1050
00:50:42,550 --> 00:50:44,540
Look at this guy.
Future governor of New York,

1051
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:47,510
a presidential candidate.
I see a bunch of people that we've never

1052
00:50:47,511 --> 00:50:51,290
fucking heard about,
but people that were governors and look

1053
00:50:51,291 --> 00:50:52,910
at that pres.
Prescott Bush.

1054
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:54,890
Let's have that.
Pull that up.

1055
00:50:55,770 --> 00:50:57,860
Let me see if you thought w was a wild
man.

1056
00:50:57,861 --> 00:50:59,990
His college years,
you should have met his granddaddy

1057
00:50:59,991 --> 00:51:02,540
Prescott.
The future senator from Connecticut was

1058
00:51:02,541 --> 00:51:06,620
apparently a real cut up.
Who along with some other bones men is

1059
00:51:06,621 --> 00:51:11,090
believed to have dug up and absconded
with the skull of the legendary native

1060
00:51:11,091 --> 00:51:14,030
American Warrior Geronimo during World
War One.

1061
00:51:14,330 --> 00:51:16,520
Whoa.
He Stole Geronimo Skull.

1062
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:18,920
That's pretty gangster.
Legend has it.

1063
00:51:18,921 --> 00:51:23,180
The journos head is still inside skull
and bones headquarters known as the tomb

1064
00:51:23,181 --> 00:51:25,670
at 64 high street in new haven.
By the way,

1065
00:51:25,671 --> 00:51:28,910
new haven is a shit.
No offense to anybody who is in new

1066
00:51:28,911 --> 00:51:30,050
haven.
Is it better?

1067
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:30,973
No,
it's not.

1068
00:51:31,070 --> 00:51:32,900
No,
it's a bounce back cause the gentrified

1069
00:51:32,901 --> 00:51:35,240
yet they used to be a comedy club there.
I remember that place.

1070
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:38,770
Joker's wild.
I don't remember it lot.

1071
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:40,610
Was it in a fun hotel?
No.

1072
00:51:40,611 --> 00:51:42,060
No.
It was just a comedy club there.

1073
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:44,300
Yeah.
Wild dude owned it.

1074
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:46,760
Crazy guy.
Saw Him beat a guy up with a shoe.

1075
00:51:50,630 --> 00:51:52,880
Yeah.
Some guy was talking shit,

1076
00:51:52,881 --> 00:51:54,050
I forgot what,
what happened?

1077
00:51:54,051 --> 00:51:56,060
What have,
I forget what caused the fight cause I

1078
00:51:56,061 --> 00:51:59,150
was on stage and uh,
he pulled his shoe off and hit the

1079
00:51:59,151 --> 00:52:01,790
fucking guy in the head with the wooden
part of his shoe.

1080
00:52:01,791 --> 00:52:03,610
His heel of a shoe.
Yeah.

1081
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:06,530
So I don't know what the guy did to him.
The guy must have hit him or something,

1082
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:10,010
but he was a wild man.
But that whole area was like super

1083
00:52:10,011 --> 00:52:12,920
sketchy.
Like drive it around to the club.

1084
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:15,530
Dark and creepy.
It was lit.

1085
00:52:15,531 --> 00:52:19,760
It was,
it was borderline like sketchy.

1086
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:21,620
Yeah.
It's weird that skull and bones is

1087
00:52:21,621 --> 00:52:23,990
there.
I don't know.

1088
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:25,600
He's scared.
No,

1089
00:52:25,610 --> 00:52:27,530
not scared.
Let's kill the shit out me man.

1090
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:30,590
With Prescott Bush character and it
scares you.

1091
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:32,330
It scares.
It's Darth Vader,

1092
00:52:32,810 --> 00:52:36,230
Dun Dun Duh Dun Dun Dun Dun.
You know what's interesting?

1093
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:39,860
They talked us into believing that
George Bush was from Texas.

1094
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:41,050
Okay.

1095
00:52:41,050 --> 00:52:42,700
Where is he from?
Connecticut.

1096
00:52:43,270 --> 00:52:47,560
How about the Maine and Connecticut?
His Dad was from a Zad from Maine,

1097
00:52:47,561 --> 00:52:48,820
right?
Didn't they grow up in Maine?

1098
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:55,150
Pretty sure,
right?

1099
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:57,630
They're both on this list.
I was just trying to see if it says no.

1100
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:00,670
There's a gang of uh,
people on that list at why not being

1101
00:53:00,671 --> 00:53:02,350
present.
It's just stop and think about how crazy

1102
00:53:02,351 --> 00:53:04,110
that is.
But she'd be,

1103
00:53:04,111 --> 00:53:08,650
be a little wound up being president
there was getting this vote.

1104
00:53:09,670 --> 00:53:11,930
Yeah.
Well the phone you get to vote.

1105
00:53:12,530 --> 00:53:17,470
Do you think that maybe they hired
Donald Trump to just act like a total

1106
00:53:17,471 --> 00:53:20,260
complete shit head?
Because they knew there were so many

1107
00:53:20,261 --> 00:53:22,810
Republicans that are shitheads they
could just get them to the,

1108
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:26,790
to the podium and then he would crumble
under the weight of Hillary Clinton.

1109
00:53:27,050 --> 00:53:30,160
It's the greatest professional wrestling
act ever,

1110
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:31,640
ever.
Really is

1111
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:39,160
going to build walls.
How many shows have we sold

1112
00:53:42,630 --> 00:53:43,800
the extra,
extra,

1113
00:53:43,801 --> 00:53:48,801
extra large as a flying off the shelves.
The wall just got 10 foot bigger.

1114
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:51,720
That's what I said.
That's what I told him.

1115
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,630
He's a,
his deliveries,

1116
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:56,790
very pro wrestling,
his delivery,

1117
00:53:56,791 --> 00:53:59,490
super pro wrestling.
He's professional.

1118
00:53:59,491 --> 00:54:00,930
Fuck it.
It's brilliant.

1119
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:02,050
It's brilliant.

1120
00:54:02,410 --> 00:54:05,650
Teach what's washed the part where he
says the wall just got 10 feet bigger

1121
00:54:05,770 --> 00:54:08,470
because it is a guy in a movie.

1122
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:13,630
What do you want to make America great

1123
00:54:18,270 --> 00:54:23,270
said.
They will not under any circumstance.

1124
00:54:27,010 --> 00:54:32,010
I said the wall just got 10 feet higher.
Look at that guy behind him.

1125
00:54:33,191 --> 00:54:35,140
Pause for a second,
pause for a second.

1126
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:35,350
Then

1127
00:54:35,350 --> 00:54:37,900
that guy behind him,
that's silly man.

1128
00:54:38,190 --> 00:54:40,690
Right to whistling.
Look,

1129
00:54:40,691 --> 00:54:42,220
we're looking at him on the left.
That guy,

1130
00:54:42,370 --> 00:54:43,840
the guy right over his right shoulder.
Okay,

1131
00:54:43,841 --> 00:54:45,370
that guy.
See that guy?

1132
00:54:45,870 --> 00:54:49,180
That guy is a problem because guys like
that,

1133
00:54:49,181 --> 00:54:50,740
they're not supposed to make it this
far.

1134
00:54:50,770 --> 00:54:53,560
They're supposed to be eaten by wolves a
long time ago.

1135
00:54:53,710 --> 00:54:55,900
They're supposed to be like that guy
that keeps surviving and game of

1136
00:54:55,901 --> 00:54:57,760
thrones.
It's with the wildling lady with the

1137
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,090
buddy.
That guy is more bad ass.

1138
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:02,200
He keeps figuring out a way to survive.
But this guy,

1139
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:04,570
there's,
there was a Duncan trussell podcast he

1140
00:55:04,571 --> 00:55:06,880
did receive recently with Tim.
Hi Decker and Tim.

1141
00:55:06,881 --> 00:55:08,890
Hi Decker,
who was from Tim and Eric.

1142
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:11,260
Hilarious,
amazing guy.

1143
00:55:11,650 --> 00:55:14,560
He nailed it.
And one of the things that he said that

1144
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:16,770
just really resonated in my head,
he's,

1145
00:55:16,771 --> 00:55:21,190
he said there's always been this desire
that people have to identify with the

1146
00:55:21,191 --> 00:55:26,191
strong man and two to give in to submit
to the strong man and that that's what

1147
00:55:26,681 --> 00:55:27,190
he is.

1148
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:30,820
He's the strong,
super confident man and that guy over

1149
00:55:30,821 --> 00:55:33,880
his shoulder is the kind of guy that
looks like,

1150
00:55:33,881 --> 00:55:35,670
you know,
probably probably a nice guy.

1151
00:55:35,671 --> 00:55:39,700
I probably sweetheart maybe eat a little
more than he should and it doesn't go to

1152
00:55:39,701 --> 00:55:42,870
the gym when he should and you know,
the alarm clock goes off.

1153
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:45,790
It's hard for him to get motivated.
So he's just not,

1154
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:49,480
he doesn't have a lot of get up and go
and he looks at this fucking trump guy

1155
00:55:49,481 --> 00:55:52,210
with his orange skin and it's crazy
hair,

1156
00:55:52,330 --> 00:55:53,530
makeup,
hair like a,

1157
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:56,800
like a Kennedy.
Could you imagine given that due to pot

1158
00:55:56,801 --> 00:55:59,950
cookie and a mirror and go,
hey bro,

1159
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:03,880
what's going on up here?
What is this?

1160
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:05,410
What's going on?
What are you doing?

1161
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:07,570
This is,
this is madness.

1162
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:09,820
Like you're better off having bald spots
than that.

1163
00:56:10,150 --> 00:56:10,841
If you have,
you know,

1164
00:56:10,841 --> 00:56:13,870
you just go like short trimmed hair with
some bald spots.

1165
00:56:13,871 --> 00:56:16,510
Like just that's way more gangster than
what you're doing.

1166
00:56:16,511 --> 00:56:18,040
Like what you're doing.
It's kind of crazy.

1167
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:21,490
Like no ones that doesn't know insane
hair does not look like that.

1168
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:24,160
It just doesn't look like that in the
wild.

1169
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:28,930
And
like what you've done is you've used

1170
00:56:28,931 --> 00:56:33,610
some sort of chemicals to concoct
something like you've concocted this,

1171
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:37,630
this resemblance of what your hair used
to look like and his face.

1172
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:40,740
Is it really that?
Is that the lighting or is that orange

1173
00:56:40,810 --> 00:56:44,620
or is it really that red and orange?
They do him up that he's got some people

1174
00:56:44,621 --> 00:56:47,560
to do him up and the kind of people that
do him up or probably like the kind of

1175
00:56:47,561 --> 00:56:50,230
people that really like him and they
kind of like some orange skin,

1176
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:53,230
they want to fight both.
It's war paint.

1177
00:56:53,270 --> 00:56:54,103
They want to fight.

1178
00:56:57,930 --> 00:57:00,120
It's white people.
Warpaint

1179
00:57:05,110 --> 00:57:08,290
well why doesn't he do the under eyes?
Like if you're going to do your whole,

1180
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:10,840
your face like that.
Do you think he wears like giant goggles

1181
00:57:10,841 --> 00:57:12,700
when he gets in a tanning booth?
Is that what's going on?

1182
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:17,580
Like why is this
is just white.

1183
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:19,510
Surely he knows what he looks like.
Right?

1184
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:21,580
But then,
but then you look at his hair and you

1185
00:57:21,581 --> 00:57:22,660
go,
well why is he doing that?

1186
00:57:22,661 --> 00:57:26,380
Then you know,
why isn't he just Jason stayed it.

1187
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:30,070
He just tapped into,
he just watched Fox News and just sweat.

1188
00:57:30,430 --> 00:57:33,160
Okay these guys,
these guys need a hero.

1189
00:57:33,430 --> 00:57:38,430
I think he's just got an extraordinary
sense of confidence in some weird way.

1190
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:41,710
People are attracted to confidence.
Yeah.

1191
00:57:41,711 --> 00:57:45,630
Well that's what high decker was saying.
Hi Decker was saying that this desire to

1192
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:49,390
submit to the strong man is like,
what's going on here?

1193
00:57:49,390 --> 00:57:50,310
And I'm like,
God bet.

1194
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:53,050
That's right.
I bet that's a lot of it because we've

1195
00:57:53,051 --> 00:57:55,390
been talking about these guys,
that campaign for him,

1196
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:59,320
like how excited they are.
I didn't know if it was,

1197
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:02,110
I don't follow politics at all.
So I apologize.

1198
00:58:02,290 --> 00:58:07,290
Marine papers as turned off a while ago,
but just from sitting back and watching,

1199
00:58:09,610 --> 00:58:13,900
he's the only guy and I don't know if it
was planned that way or like I said,

1200
00:58:13,901 --> 00:58:15,920
it's professional wrestling.
Like here's what's going to happen.

1201
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:18,280
You're going to go here.
Then you're going to bow.

1202
00:58:18,310 --> 00:58:20,230
Oh,
why do I have to flip into this fucking

1203
00:58:20,231 --> 00:58:23,620
20 visits?
You're going to buy out the polls.

1204
00:58:23,621 --> 00:58:24,820
Love them.
That's stopping.

1205
00:58:25,690 --> 00:58:29,470
I'll put you back in a fucking office
where I'm just saying he's pissed now.

1206
00:58:29,471 --> 00:58:31,870
He's been in government 15 fucking
years.

1207
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:36,340
It cause he would go up on this podium
and the only thing what people responded

1208
00:58:36,341 --> 00:58:38,920
to,
he would call people out and people

1209
00:58:39,130 --> 00:58:42,160
loved that.
They already give that to you.

1210
00:58:42,161 --> 00:58:46,180
24 seven shows like Kardashians and all.
It's so twitter,

1211
00:58:46,181 --> 00:58:47,890
every insult,
insult.

1212
00:58:47,891 --> 00:58:50,410
That's the new fucking little guys
power.

1213
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:53,740
He gets up there.
He insults people.

1214
00:58:53,741 --> 00:58:55,660
I'm calling you out.
CBS.

1215
00:58:56,050 --> 00:58:59,580
He does.
Whenever you know it,

1216
00:58:59,581 --> 00:59:00,960
they're like,
I've never seen anyways.

1217
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:01,953
He's not empowered.

1218
00:59:04,730 --> 00:59:07,190
How it working?
It's fucking brilliant.

1219
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:12,400
Keep them all yellow
script.

1220
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:16,820
It's fucking lives go what's going on?
They're jamming

1221
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:20,060
too far out.
No,

1222
00:59:20,061 --> 00:59:21,640
you're perfect.
Yeah,

1223
00:59:21,650 --> 00:59:22,040
you've got

1224
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:23,600
it nailed.
I mean,

1225
00:59:23,601 --> 00:59:26,330
not that,
that is a guy who's a manager in a pro

1226
00:59:26,331 --> 00:59:27,164
wrestling show.

1227
00:59:28,450 --> 00:59:29,960
That's the manager.
That's like,

1228
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:33,470
if he was like representing Bruno San
Martino and he's leaning them towards

1229
00:59:33,471 --> 00:59:34,620
this,
the squared circle,

1230
00:59:34,770 --> 00:59:35,700
he'd be like,
yes,

1231
00:59:35,830 --> 00:59:39,210
yes.
This is hall Colgan's manager Donald

1232
00:59:39,210 --> 00:59:40,110
Trump.
This is what he's going to do.

1233
00:59:40,111 --> 00:59:44,460
If he loses and Hillary wins,
he's going to manage Hulk Hogan and the

1234
00:59:44,461 --> 00:59:49,461
whole is going to have to go back to wwe
is going to make a comeback because he

1235
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:52,380
to Gawker is not going to pay him.
And so,

1236
00:59:52,381 --> 00:59:54,330
uh,
he spent all the Gawker money and that's

1237
00:59:54,331 --> 00:59:55,710
gonna be,
that's gonna be the plot.

1238
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:57,770
He spent all that Gawker money cause he
thought,

1239
00:59:58,090 --> 01:00:02,080
I thought we lived in a country that
abide by the rules.

1240
01:00:03,130 --> 01:00:06,040
I thought when you go to court or you
lose,

1241
01:00:06,041 --> 01:00:10,240
you pay up.
So I bought a house in Florida.

1242
01:00:10,241 --> 01:00:11,950
I really liked this house.
I don't want to lose it.

1243
01:00:13,950 --> 01:00:18,950
So finch and I came to an arrangement.
I come back here and kick you are candy

1244
01:00:19,681 --> 01:00:21,430
ass president.

1245
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:24,610
W W was what are the disease?
The president of wwe.

1246
01:00:24,630 --> 01:00:25,463
His ass.
Yeah.

1247
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:27,980
Yeah.
I mean Vince Mcmahon and hall Cogan.

1248
01:00:28,010 --> 01:00:30,050
They have a match.
Cause Vince always wanted to have a

1249
01:00:30,051 --> 01:00:35,051
match with Hulk Hogan and they go at it
and he makes $50 trillion.

1250
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:38,260
Oh look at that.
Donald Trump and vince mcmahon.

1251
01:00:38,261 --> 01:00:41,180
It's already happened.
He was on it a couple of years ago.

1252
01:00:41,181 --> 01:00:43,640
They shaved.
I think he's telling you he shaved his

1253
01:00:43,641 --> 01:00:45,530
head.
Shaved Vince's head.

1254
01:00:46,270 --> 01:00:49,040
Oh good Lord.
Let's look at this.

1255
01:00:49,041 --> 01:00:51,020
This is hilarious.
What a good show.

1256
01:00:52,340 --> 01:00:54,800
Vince is.
A smart man will tell you that.

1257
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:57,740
Brilliant guys making a lot of money.
Why didn't he run for president?

1258
01:00:57,741 --> 01:01:00,080
He'd when he would,
when he'd fucking win.

1259
01:01:00,110 --> 01:01:02,510
How scary is that?
If Donald Loses,

1260
01:01:02,511 --> 01:01:04,970
he might win.
Dude,

1261
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:09,350
it doesn't scare you that that many
people,

1262
01:01:09,380 --> 01:01:11,510
there's people that still believe in big
foot.

1263
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:14,060
Wait a minute.
Back host,

1264
01:01:15,350 --> 01:01:19,700
and I had bobcat Goldthwait and here a
couple of weeks ago arguing that big

1265
01:01:19,701 --> 01:01:21,890
foot footage was real.
No,

1266
01:01:21,891 --> 01:01:22,724
you didn't.

1267
01:01:25,250 --> 01:01:27,230
Bobcat is a big foot believer at,
first of all,

1268
01:01:27,231 --> 01:01:28,440
he's going to waste.
I see it.

1269
01:01:28,450 --> 01:01:28,840
Yeah.
No,

1270
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:29,673
no,
no,

1271
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:30,531
no,
no.

1272
01:01:30,531 --> 01:01:31,700
For Real.
He's got a movie.

1273
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,940
He's got this movie called Willow Creek.
It's really good.

1274
01:01:35,060 --> 01:01:36,530
It's not a,
it's not a comedy.

1275
01:01:36,750 --> 01:01:40,340
It's a horror movie about big foot.
It's like Blair witch,

1276
01:01:40,341 --> 01:01:42,410
so he doesn't believe it's rewritten.
Believes it's real.

1277
01:01:42,411 --> 01:01:44,660
And he went to the big foot conference.
You still sell that?

1278
01:01:44,690 --> 01:01:45,680
Nope.
Nope.

1279
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:46,790
No.
I know bobcat.

1280
01:01:46,791 --> 01:01:48,750
He really believes it's real.
He know only to,

1281
01:01:48,950 --> 01:01:52,760
he believes that that video,
that Patterson footage of the fucking

1282
01:01:52,761 --> 01:01:53,930
deal in my suit.
Yup.

1283
01:01:53,990 --> 01:01:54,631
That one.
Yep.

1284
01:01:54,631 --> 01:01:57,230
It takes,
that's real hundred percent yes he does.

1285
01:01:57,560 --> 01:01:58,700
Is he does.
I know.

1286
01:01:58,701 --> 01:01:59,720
It seems crazy,
right?

1287
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:01,460
I think he was playing,
you know,

1288
01:02:01,490 --> 01:02:03,200
a lot of people do.
Every time we talk about this,

1289
01:02:03,201 --> 01:02:05,660
I get fucking hate tweets from big foot
lovers,

1290
01:02:06,470 --> 01:02:07,790
just big foot lovers.
Oh,

1291
01:02:07,791 --> 01:02:09,590
big,
big for love it.

1292
01:02:09,591 --> 01:02:13,730
If he was just fans on TV,
this famous big foot.

1293
01:02:13,731 --> 01:02:15,800
And I love the ghost that they're always
fine.

1294
01:02:15,890 --> 01:02:18,410
They're all trump supporters.
It's weird.

1295
01:02:19,230 --> 01:02:20,063
Right?

1296
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:24,990
But no for real.
Bob Cat really is a big foot believer.

1297
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:26,700
Wow.
That's odd to me.

1298
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:29,730
I don't see him as really thinking that
way.

1299
01:02:29,850 --> 01:02:31,740
Well,
I don't know what it is.

1300
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:35,910
My used do it my mom.
That's how I realize my mom was a little

1301
01:02:35,911 --> 01:02:40,911
dopey cause as a kid not being serious,
they've lost the bigfoot show and I'm

1302
01:02:41,371 --> 01:02:44,820
thinking as a little kid I believed it.
They would interview literally people on

1303
01:02:44,821 --> 01:02:48,120
a rock like a hippy and it's like,
yeah,

1304
01:02:48,121 --> 01:02:51,870
he was just hanging out and he was kind
of in his head and my mom go ice,

1305
01:02:51,871 --> 01:02:53,280
believe it.
My father is gone.

1306
01:02:53,310 --> 01:02:55,320
She,
Jesus Christ.

1307
01:02:55,740 --> 01:02:58,650
There probably was something at one
point until there was,

1308
01:02:59,130 --> 01:03:00,300
well,
there was definitely an animal called

1309
01:03:00,301 --> 01:03:02,160
gigantic [inaudible].
You know about that?

1310
01:03:02,190 --> 01:03:03,270
No.
What is it?

1311
01:03:03,271 --> 01:03:04,104
Oh,
Jim Brewer.

1312
01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:06,450
What does it all up?
The photo of John Carroll Pythius next

1313
01:03:06,451 --> 01:03:07,290
to a human being.

1314
01:03:07,470 --> 01:03:12,470
It was a huge bipedal hominid that they
found bones of in Asia.

1315
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:17,660
In the 1920s there was an apothecary
shop and China and an anthropologist was

1316
01:03:18,121 --> 01:03:22,260
in there and it was studying some of the
teeth that they had any recognize this

1317
01:03:22,261 --> 01:03:25,680
enormous teeth tooth to be a primary
tooth of unknown origin.

1318
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:28,530
He's like,
this is way too large to be a gorilla.

1319
01:03:28,770 --> 01:03:30,270
Like what is this?
And where'd you get it?

1320
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:34,650
So the people brought him to this
apothecary shop.

1321
01:03:34,651 --> 01:03:38,490
There's a photo of a recreation of a
gigantic Pacific is next to a guy,

1322
01:03:38,850 --> 01:03:39,820
the orangutan?
No,

1323
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:40,381
no,
no,

1324
01:03:40,381 --> 01:03:41,214
no,
no,

1325
01:03:42,180 --> 01:03:43,013
no.
There's a,

1326
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:45,630
just go back to the images.
Please go back to images.

1327
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:46,561
Scroll down,
you'll,

1328
01:03:46,561 --> 01:03:48,290
you'll definitely find it.
It's gigantic.

1329
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:50,130
Pithy gets next to a person.
Can,

1330
01:03:50,131 --> 01:03:51,660
I just shows you in scale.
But it was a,

1331
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:53,640
so they found bones.
Okay.

1332
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:57,600
And they found lower job bones that
would indicate it was a bipedal ape.

1333
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:00,030
Okay.
So I guess it's the position of the jaw

1334
01:04:00,031 --> 01:04:01,770
is different.
If you're on all fours,

1335
01:04:01,771 --> 01:04:04,500
then if you stand up so that,
that's it right there.

1336
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:08,730
All right.
So this thing lived as recently as a

1337
01:04:08,730 --> 01:04:10,650
hundred thousand years ago,
and maybe more soon.

1338
01:04:10,651 --> 01:04:12,540
But this is like,
they didn't even know about it until

1339
01:04:12,541 --> 01:04:17,541
1920 when they got these bones.
So in 1920 they had those bones and they

1340
01:04:18,541 --> 01:04:21,240
had them once carbon dating was
invented,

1341
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:23,340
they dated those bones to a hundred
thousand years ago.

1342
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:25,920
So that was a real animal.
Can I just tell you,

1343
01:04:26,670 --> 01:04:29,190
if you,
you need to change the whole edge.

1344
01:04:29,220 --> 01:04:30,990
I would go to school every day.
If this was school

1345
01:04:33,390 --> 01:04:36,180
as a kid,
like learned about big foot and we know

1346
01:04:36,230 --> 01:04:39,660
we went
everywhere we went today we just sat

1347
01:04:39,661 --> 01:04:40,441
there like,
dude,

1348
01:04:40,441 --> 01:04:42,930
fucking bad that I'm not coming up going
back to school tomorrow.

1349
01:04:43,590 --> 01:04:47,340
Ah,
well there's cool shit to learn man.

1350
01:04:47,370 --> 01:04:49,170
This is cool shit.
Like this is cool.

1351
01:04:49,171 --> 01:04:51,900
Anthropology,
I'm not sure if I deny it though because

1352
01:04:51,901 --> 01:04:53,350
you have to.
You have a tid.

1353
01:04:53,820 --> 01:04:55,410
Listen,
that's a real animal.

1354
01:04:55,710 --> 01:04:59,310
Well that's a a hundred percent
confirmed animal.

1355
01:04:59,580 --> 01:05:01,380
That's a confirmed.
They just found it.

1356
01:05:01,381 --> 01:05:03,660
Who,
who founded archeologists,

1357
01:05:03,661 --> 01:05:06,800
they dug up and anthropologists,
they studied these bonuses.

1358
01:05:06,870 --> 01:05:10,620
We're getting $400,000 of shares and
funds.

1359
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:13,230
If we don't find a goddamn tooth or
something,

1360
01:05:13,350 --> 01:05:15,660
we got to file out like Dag every
fucking place.

1361
01:05:15,661 --> 01:05:17,560
We can't Charlie.
And there's place.

1362
01:05:17,561 --> 01:05:21,670
I know PRC interest.
It's just another way to get money.

1363
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:22,780
Yeah,
but they have the bone,

1364
01:05:22,810 --> 01:05:25,970
so you can go see the bones and other
anthropologists studying the bones.

1365
01:05:25,971 --> 01:05:30,340
The bones get the guys to white coat.
We approximately say that.

1366
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:35,760
I would say estimated 13 myths,
13,000 possibly upside.

1367
01:05:37,711 --> 01:05:40,720
That's 130,000 years ago.

1368
01:05:41,170 --> 01:05:43,870
This thing roamed the US.
I can't have

1369
01:05:45,670 --> 01:05:49,810
putting it out in the real special one
time magazine and the,

1370
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:52,160
what's it called?
What was the fucking monkey call?

1371
01:05:52,161 --> 01:05:55,560
Gigantic Shark.
Good to pick a pickup and a stress

1372
01:05:55,630 --> 01:06:00,080
discolored.
Read all about it and pay $10 you don't

1373
01:06:00,081 --> 01:06:02,830
mother fuckers,
but why is it any weirder than a gorilla

1374
01:06:03,970 --> 01:06:04,930
grill?
I can see,

1375
01:06:04,931 --> 01:06:07,930
and we physically can see it.
That's almost not,

1376
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:09,820
you know,
they didn't even know mountain gorillas

1377
01:06:09,821 --> 01:06:14,230
existed until the 20th century because
white people never went that way.

1378
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:15,090
Yeah,
exactly.

1379
01:06:15,090 --> 01:06:17,230
And when they first got photos of
mountain gorillas,

1380
01:06:17,260 --> 01:06:18,880
they were like,
what in the fuck?

1381
01:06:19,170 --> 01:06:19,950
Yeah,
no,

1382
01:06:19,950 --> 01:06:23,230
these are real 1920s yeah.
Find out when they found,

1383
01:06:23,231 --> 01:06:24,730
when they first discovered the mountain
gorilla,

1384
01:06:24,731 --> 01:06:28,690
I want to say it was the early 19
hundreds and uh,

1385
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:31,000
you know,
that's an animal that we just take for

1386
01:06:31,001 --> 01:06:32,680
granted is definitely being real.

1387
01:06:33,030 --> 01:06:35,260
This is a lot of those gym.
There's a lot of those.

1388
01:06:35,590 --> 01:06:39,580
This is a guy who's been dedicated his
entire life to trying to find a giant

1389
01:06:39,581 --> 01:06:42,880
sloths in the Amazon.
This guy is convinced that the giant

1390
01:06:42,881 --> 01:06:46,540
sloths in the Amazon still live mountain
girl was first discovered by a German

1391
01:06:46,541 --> 01:06:51,541
officer in 1902 nine two oh two captain
Robert Vaughn Beringia.

1392
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:55,810
Prior to this time,
only lowland gorillas were known to

1393
01:06:55,811 --> 01:06:57,700
exist.
The mountain gorillas subspecies is

1394
01:06:57,701 --> 01:07:00,100
derived from the captain Robert Vaughn
bearings.

1395
01:07:00,490 --> 01:07:05,490
Last name gorilla bearing g Barend.
Gee,

1396
01:07:05,830 --> 01:07:08,260
what does that gorilla Bringi Bringi.
That's his name.

1397
01:07:09,820 --> 01:07:11,510
Robert Vaughn.
Prng what?

1398
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:13,450
Why they have to have it twice.
Gorilla Benji,

1399
01:07:13,451 --> 01:07:16,600
Benji,
what's around in 1902 like what's going

1400
01:07:16,601 --> 01:07:17,650
on?
Not a lot.

1401
01:07:17,770 --> 01:07:22,030
Photos are only 40 years old thinking
that before that they were drawing shit.

1402
01:07:22,420 --> 01:07:24,160
That's,
that's how crazy that is.

1403
01:07:24,460 --> 01:07:25,780
Like sticks.
Yeah.

1404
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:28,060
And drawing and well,
I mean painting.

1405
01:07:28,090 --> 01:07:29,620
I mean,
you know Michelangelo and all that,

1406
01:07:29,621 --> 01:07:32,230
all that's trip was before that.
But that was how you got images back

1407
01:07:32,231 --> 01:07:34,450
then.
You had to paint them when we don't,

1408
01:07:34,540 --> 01:07:37,990
we don't really,
we take photographs for granted so much.

1409
01:07:37,991 --> 01:07:42,280
We don't realize that the photograph was
invented in the 18 hundreds.

1410
01:07:42,910 --> 01:07:44,950
I mean that's not that long ago.
All right.

1411
01:07:45,010 --> 01:07:47,140
Now why was this guy even think about
this?

1412
01:07:47,141 --> 01:07:49,420
18 hundreds you didn't really have great
shoot.

1413
01:07:49,421 --> 01:07:51,730
Why,
why are you just going up in an area?

1414
01:07:51,731 --> 01:07:53,950
Why theirs?
Cause he's nowhere near from Africa

1415
01:07:53,951 --> 01:07:56,080
where it was the guy,
well there was a lot of explorers back

1416
01:07:56,081 --> 01:08:00,010
there in Africa because they had found
it and they started to colonize certain

1417
01:08:00,011 --> 01:08:02,140
aspects of,
of Africa,

1418
01:08:02,450 --> 01:08:05,620
like the colonized South Africa,
which is why they all use a nice word

1419
01:08:05,621 --> 01:08:06,454
for it.
Slaving.

1420
01:08:06,670 --> 01:08:07,540
Yeah.
Dutch.

1421
01:08:07,541 --> 01:08:11,480
The Dutch came to Africa and uh,
they enslaved people and they made these

1422
01:08:11,481 --> 01:08:15,130
settlements and they tried to make
settlements in the Congo itself.

1423
01:08:15,140 --> 01:08:16,070
But the jungle just

1424
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:18,800
swallowed everything.
Always.

1425
01:08:18,830 --> 01:08:20,870
They would make,
they would spend all this money and have

1426
01:08:20,871 --> 01:08:24,290
boats go down there and they built these
beautiful mansions in the Congo,

1427
01:08:24,530 --> 01:08:27,290
but the Congo always ate it up.
It's just too wild.

1428
01:08:27,291 --> 01:08:29,270
They just couldn't,
they couldn't tame the Congo.

1429
01:08:29,330 --> 01:08:31,030
They thought they were going to go there
and,

1430
01:08:31,410 --> 01:08:34,540
and figured out how to tame that thing.
Teach them all about,

1431
01:08:34,620 --> 01:08:37,860
uh,
Noah's Ark and things like that and

1432
01:08:37,861 --> 01:08:40,190
their abcs and they just couldn't
survive.

1433
01:08:40,191 --> 01:08:42,830
Six months.
You can survive in the jungle itself.

1434
01:08:43,100 --> 01:08:46,280
Like the jungle itself was just so
fucking wild.

1435
01:08:46,281 --> 01:08:50,090
There's no taming the Congo.
Like you would have to have like a full

1436
01:08:50,091 --> 01:08:53,630
scale Western invasion to tame the
Congo.

1437
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:58,631
We would have to clear cut and start
chopping down giant swaths of the forest

1438
01:08:58,761 --> 01:09:02,510
and putting up malls and blowing coal
into the air and lighting everything on

1439
01:09:02,511 --> 01:09:02,750
fire.

1440
01:09:02,750 --> 01:09:05,420
And we still wouldn't win.
It's just too much of it.

1441
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:09,710
It's too big.
She had been able to shows the Congo

1442
01:09:09,711 --> 01:09:10,620
gets all the shows.
No.

1443
01:09:10,621 --> 01:09:13,490
What's so shows where the true,
they throw you out there naked and

1444
01:09:13,491 --> 01:09:15,030
afraid.
They don't go to the Congo.

1445
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:18,290
It's the one place that I haven't been
yet.

1446
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:21,710
He ain't gonna make it.
We don't have enough insurance to cover

1447
01:09:21,711 --> 01:09:24,620
you in Congo.
Nagin and Fred means eaten.

1448
01:09:25,010 --> 01:09:28,370
You get eaten.
But can you imagine it's 1902 think of

1449
01:09:28,371 --> 01:09:30,230
everything.
You've seen your life at that moment,

1450
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:31,970
right?
It's not a whole lot to see

1451
01:09:33,620 --> 01:09:37,880
and you're going up the mountains and
surely there was a tribe guy or

1452
01:09:37,881 --> 01:09:40,150
something that was like,
well,

1453
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:43,100
it Booboo,
give him that little term like don't go

1454
01:09:43,101 --> 01:09:44,540
up there.
He didn't know what he was saying.

1455
01:09:44,690 --> 01:09:45,523
Finally,
go up there.

1456
01:09:45,770 --> 01:09:50,770
Imagine first time encountering a
gorilla.

1457
01:09:52,340 --> 01:09:54,380
Jesus.
You've never seen anything like that and

1458
01:09:54,381 --> 01:09:56,880
your life.
Is that a fucking huge,

1459
01:09:56,900 --> 01:09:58,240
what the fuck is that?
Yeah,

1460
01:09:58,430 --> 01:10:00,770
I've seen maybe a hippo.
Is that a hippa?

1461
01:10:01,420 --> 01:10:05,130
Like can you imagine just squaring off
and if that thing you ever see,

1462
01:10:05,140 --> 01:10:09,500
like when a gorilla charges
Jesus and that guy,

1463
01:10:09,530 --> 01:10:11,660
that guy,
I would have flipped out.

1464
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:14,180
Yeah.
Imagine being in a time when there was

1465
01:10:14,181 --> 01:10:19,010
no photographs and visiting the jungle
in Africa and seeing all the wildlife.

1466
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:23,810
Seeing a lion sees a fucking line and
what do you win that's going to protect

1467
01:10:23,811 --> 01:10:26,660
you from it.
A lot of guys had been eating who was

1468
01:10:26,661 --> 01:10:28,220
this shame?
That's supposedly the picture.

1469
01:10:28,221 --> 01:10:30,290
I was just reading a story about when
they found it.

1470
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:32,000
This is like the,
his encounter.

1471
01:10:32,030 --> 01:10:36,020
The first one they shot.
I'm going up a volcano or something that

1472
01:10:36,021 --> 01:10:37,110
said,
wow,

1473
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:38,630
man,
that they were tracking them and it took

1474
01:10:38,631 --> 01:10:42,560
them hours to even find it on a high and
a half the body by the time they got

1475
01:10:42,561 --> 01:10:43,394
some of it or something.

1476
01:10:43,550 --> 01:10:45,320
Whoa.
This is a picture shot.

1477
01:10:45,350 --> 01:10:47,420
The gorilla body by the time they got to
it.

1478
01:10:47,570 --> 01:10:48,670
Yeah.
Oh,

1479
01:10:48,750 --> 01:10:51,410
I'm not quitting.
They said they had shot two.

1480
01:10:51,530 --> 01:10:53,810
They killed to the shot too.
I'm not sure if how they killed it.

1481
01:10:53,811 --> 01:10:56,330
It didn't say it,
but they retrieved it by rope and they

1482
01:10:56,331 --> 01:10:58,640
found that it was about 200 pounds,
the one they found.

1483
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,040
Dude,
Africa is still crazy.

1484
01:11:01,070 --> 01:11:02,450
Have you been there?
No,

1485
01:11:02,451 --> 01:11:04,010
I was going to go to Tanzania this
summer,

1486
01:11:04,011 --> 01:11:06,380
but I heard that you have to take all
kinds of crazy shots.

1487
01:11:06,410 --> 01:11:06,751
No,
no,

1488
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:09,110
no.
You take a malaria shots.

1489
01:11:09,530 --> 01:11:11,300
Yeah.
I think he'd take two shots.

1490
01:11:11,420 --> 01:11:13,530
Yankee tickets?
Yeah.

1491
01:11:14,490 --> 01:11:16,230
Did you take your kids to Africa?
Yeah.

1492
01:11:16,290 --> 01:11:17,250
Did you?
Yeah.

1493
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:19,590
Where'd you guys go with Tanzania?
Did you?

1494
01:11:19,740 --> 01:11:20,850
Yeah,
it was sick.

1495
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:23,020
Was it?
Did you lose?

1496
01:11:23,060 --> 01:11:25,350
It's there.
You can follow.

1497
01:11:25,950 --> 01:11:28,950
You can follow a,
there's a tribe there that you can

1498
01:11:28,951 --> 01:11:31,410
follow for like two,
three days.

1499
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:34,050
They take your hunting.
Yes.

1500
01:11:34,051 --> 01:11:35,230
It's Kronos.
It was a,

1501
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:38,130
there was a part of her.
I got really spooked out because the guy

1502
01:11:38,131 --> 01:11:42,390
we were with who just has a spear,
he's just sitting there with a spear and

1503
01:11:42,391 --> 01:11:43,280
he said,
uh,

1504
01:11:43,330 --> 01:11:44,161
you know,
stay here,

1505
01:11:44,161 --> 01:11:46,410
stay here.
And he was going after some low animal.

1506
01:11:46,750 --> 01:11:48,000
It was just me and my daughter.
Like,

1507
01:11:48,001 --> 01:11:51,240
oh my God,
why do we do with an African?

1508
01:11:51,630 --> 01:11:52,550
Yes,
Jamie.

1509
01:11:52,551 --> 01:11:54,840
We'll think of that like,
here I am from Florida,

1510
01:11:54,900 --> 01:11:57,120
now I'm spear hunting with some African
dude and my kid.

1511
01:11:58,260 --> 01:11:59,670
What the fuck,
man?

1512
01:11:59,790 --> 01:12:01,470
It was weird,
but it was awesome.

1513
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:05,190
It was really awesome.
You should go on it or shows your mind

1514
01:12:05,191 --> 01:12:07,710
now I should,
I have a friend who went there and he

1515
01:12:07,711 --> 01:12:12,480
was on a hunting trip and uh,
poachers were in the area and when they

1516
01:12:12,481 --> 01:12:15,810
see poachers,
they just start shooting anthem shooting

1517
01:12:15,811 --> 01:12:18,240
at the poachers to shooting at them.
And he's like,

1518
01:12:18,241 --> 01:12:20,640
you have to shoot them when you see them
because they will shoot you and they

1519
01:12:20,641 --> 01:12:22,770
will kill you.
And they were getting shot at by

1520
01:12:22,771 --> 01:12:23,431
poachers.
I'm like,

1521
01:12:23,431 --> 01:12:26,040
so you were in a gun fight poachers?
Yeah,

1522
01:12:26,041 --> 01:12:29,250
cause they want that Tusk,
they didn't kill anybody but Simon Tusk,

1523
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:32,400
a lot of it is just meat.
It's like these people just starving to

1524
01:12:32,401 --> 01:12:34,170
death.
It's crazy like that.

1525
01:12:34,171 --> 01:12:38,130
Who's coming in to get all this ball?
All sorts of different various variables

1526
01:12:38,370 --> 01:12:41,140
that you got people that are poaching
for like Rhino Horn,

1527
01:12:41,490 --> 01:12:42,960
ivory tusks and stuff like that.

1528
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:44,880
That's all you really hear about.
But then you got people that are

1529
01:12:44,940 --> 01:12:47,970
poaching just for meat.
They go on someone's private land and

1530
01:12:47,971 --> 01:12:50,190
they kill the animals and they call them
a poacher.

1531
01:12:50,250 --> 01:12:52,680
What they really are.
It's just fucking poor people.

1532
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:54,330
That's it.
So anyway,

1533
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:55,890
wow.
These people,

1534
01:12:56,220 --> 01:12:58,140
you know,
sometimes the poachers were shooted them

1535
01:12:58,141 --> 01:13:00,030
and they shoot at the poachers and so
when they're asking,

1536
01:13:00,031 --> 01:13:01,680
I'm like,
what do you do if you shoot one of

1537
01:13:01,681 --> 01:13:02,850
these?
And he goes,

1538
01:13:03,060 --> 01:13:05,730
most of the time we let the Hyena sorted
out.

1539
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:09,090
Wow.
Let the hyenas sorted out.

1540
01:13:09,091 --> 01:13:12,600
Like Cue,
I'm managing your shooting people and

1541
01:13:12,601 --> 01:13:14,850
just leaving them for [inaudible] is to
eat.

1542
01:13:15,270 --> 01:13:19,320
You've got human eating hyenas in your
backyard essentially,

1543
01:13:19,470 --> 01:13:22,350
and you're watching it
and that's,

1544
01:13:22,351 --> 01:13:26,190
and you're accustomed to it now.
They must have seen it at least once,

1545
01:13:26,220 --> 01:13:26,820
right?
Yes.

1546
01:13:26,820 --> 01:13:29,700
It must have come upon a guy that they
just shot,

1547
01:13:29,730 --> 01:13:33,180
checked on the body and seeing the high
end is tearing it apart with that noise.

1548
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:36,990
Ooh,
they're the creeps.

1549
01:13:37,150 --> 01:13:39,660
The green there,
the creepiest,

1550
01:13:40,380 --> 01:13:43,710
they're so weird.
So weird looking with their big back

1551
01:13:43,711 --> 01:13:46,710
legs or the big front legs and shorter
back legs.

1552
01:13:46,711 --> 01:13:49,320
They look there there.
They're mysteriously dark.

1553
01:13:49,650 --> 01:13:52,290
They're all lopsided.
They're not like flat.

1554
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:53,820
You know,
like a dog is flat,

1555
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:56,010
right?
Hyenas or like like a ramp.

1556
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:58,320
Yeah.
They go,

1557
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:02,930
they slope down this slope downward.
Really big jaw.

1558
01:14:02,970 --> 01:14:04,680
Oh,
look at that fucking thing.

1559
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:09,990
Look at the size of the God hyena
industry and some interesting facts.

1560
01:14:10,050 --> 01:14:10,883
Oh,
history.

1561
01:14:12,850 --> 01:14:14,410
Look at the,
go back to that picture again.

1562
01:14:14,411 --> 01:14:17,110
Please look at the fucking mouth on that
then.

1563
01:14:17,111 --> 01:14:20,140
And they don't fear law.
They'll go after lions to look at the

1564
01:14:20,141 --> 01:14:22,240
teeth on that thing.
That's insane.

1565
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:24,760
That doesn't even look real.
Like if that was in a movie,

1566
01:14:24,761 --> 01:14:25,541
you'd be like,
fuck,

1567
01:14:25,541 --> 01:14:30,520
I'm glad that's not real.
Africa's is so gangster.

1568
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:33,130
That's,
that's the real deal.

1569
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:34,810
Yeah.
You know what's weird is like,

1570
01:14:34,930 --> 01:14:38,560
that is where life started and where
life started.

1571
01:14:38,561 --> 01:14:43,030
It's where it's the most ferocious.
Think about all the different animals

1572
01:14:43,031 --> 01:14:43,721
that we did.
You know,

1573
01:14:43,721 --> 01:14:47,950
that there was a lot of animals like
this that lived in North America.

1574
01:14:49,170 --> 01:14:53,290
And there was a Hyena that was like a
fast running Hyena,

1575
01:14:53,291 --> 01:14:58,291
a type of Hyena here in North America.
This guy named Dan Flores.

1576
01:14:59,260 --> 01:15:00,970
He's got this book on the,
uh,

1577
01:15:01,070 --> 01:15:05,650
American Serengeti and he was on my
buddy Steven Ellis podcast talking about

1578
01:15:05,651 --> 01:15:05,730
it.

1579
01:15:05,730 --> 01:15:07,690
He's a wildlife,
a historian,

1580
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:09,980
a nature of the story.
And uh,

1581
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:13,900
he was talking about how crazy the
animals were in North America,

1582
01:15:13,901 --> 01:15:14,591
just,
you know,

1583
01:15:14,591 --> 01:15:16,790
a hundred thousand years ago,
they don't even know what,

1584
01:15:16,791 --> 01:15:18,730
what,
what caused the mass extinction.

1585
01:15:18,731 --> 01:15:21,070
But there was a bunch of crap.
They had a lion here,

1586
01:15:21,130 --> 01:15:24,190
there was bigger than the African lion.
It's called a step line.

1587
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:28,470
So is this from the divide?
Because I'd even realize that too,

1588
01:15:28,471 --> 01:15:32,320
until I was good.
The content and the bering strait.

1589
01:15:32,710 --> 01:15:34,210
Yeah.
But there was also like just mass

1590
01:15:34,211 --> 01:15:35,830
extinctions here for some strange
reason.

1591
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:37,330
And they really don't know.
They don't know.

1592
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:37,951
No,
you don't.

1593
01:15:37,951 --> 01:15:41,080
Horses like native Americans didn't have
horses.

1594
01:15:41,410 --> 01:15:44,360
The Europeans brought the horses to the
native amount.

1595
01:15:44,361 --> 01:15:45,210
I didn't do that.
Yeah.

1596
01:15:45,310 --> 01:15:49,060
But here's where it gets really crazy.
Horse has evolved in North America.

1597
01:15:49,780 --> 01:15:54,100
Horses evolved in North America and went
extinct and the only horses had survived

1598
01:15:54,101 --> 01:15:57,220
with the horses that had been captured
or had gone across the bering strait and

1599
01:15:57,221 --> 01:15:58,240
made it into Asia.

1600
01:15:58,330 --> 01:16:02,200
Those are the horses that survive.
So then when like Arabian stallions and

1601
01:16:02,201 --> 01:16:04,960
shit came back from there into North
America again,

1602
01:16:05,110 --> 01:16:07,780
they had literally originally evolved in
North America.

1603
01:16:08,980 --> 01:16:10,990
All the canines evolved in North
America,

1604
01:16:11,230 --> 01:16:13,540
like wolves,
Hyenas,

1605
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:14,530
uh,
or um,

1606
01:16:14,650 --> 01:16:15,950
uh,
um,

1607
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:19,420
what of those dingoes all those things
originally came from North America.

1608
01:16:19,750 --> 01:16:22,900
Coyotes,
maybe not dingoes is that an Australian?

1609
01:16:23,170 --> 01:16:25,540
It's a strain.
But do you think they brought them on as

1610
01:16:25,541 --> 01:16:27,760
part of something?
They brought a lot of shit over to

1611
01:16:27,761 --> 01:16:30,370
Australia.
Australia is filled with animals that

1612
01:16:30,371 --> 01:16:33,250
don't belong there and they don't belong
anywhere else.

1613
01:16:33,340 --> 01:16:34,690
No,
they're all bald is a lot of,

1614
01:16:34,930 --> 01:16:37,690
well there's like kangaroos which are
only there.

1615
01:16:37,810 --> 01:16:39,550
His real hair.
It's panda bear,

1616
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:40,870
Panda bear.
One of the heads.

1617
01:16:40,871 --> 01:16:42,220
A better the Free Koala bears.
Oh,

1618
01:16:42,221 --> 01:16:44,590
Koala bear.
Koala bear got some weird shit man.

1619
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:46,510
But um,
they also have like,

1620
01:16:47,740 --> 01:16:50,680
they have a ridiculous amount of animals
live in there.

1621
01:16:50,740 --> 01:16:53,770
And then they brought in cats to kill
some of the animals and then the cats

1622
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:56,080
got out of control and now they have a
feral cat problem.

1623
01:16:57,400 --> 01:16:58,360
They also have,
you know,

1624
01:16:58,361 --> 01:17:02,950
it scares me.
I will never have too many things you

1625
01:17:02,951 --> 01:17:04,240
can eat and kill you.
Oh,

1626
01:17:04,250 --> 01:17:07,180
I think more than Africa.
You can't swim in the ocean and they get

1627
01:17:07,181 --> 01:17:08,680
the saltwater crocs.
Oh,

1628
01:17:08,681 --> 01:17:10,130
the saltwater crocs

1629
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:15,160
and the worst outcome.
Shark attacks South South Africa in

1630
01:17:15,410 --> 01:17:17,870
Australia have like the worst shark
attacks.

1631
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:20,450
Snakes,
they get the worst snakes,

1632
01:17:21,410 --> 01:17:22,400
bugs,
spiders,

1633
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:24,760
all kinds of spiders.
It'll fade house them.

1634
01:17:25,370 --> 01:17:27,350
But the people are cool as fuck.
Yeah.

1635
01:17:27,530 --> 01:17:30,470
Australian people are some of the
coolest fucking people you'll ever meet.

1636
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:34,670
I'm a big fan.
Big Fan of Australian people.

1637
01:17:35,630 --> 01:17:37,520
If you had a move,
is that where you'd go?

1638
01:17:38,030 --> 01:17:40,550
Well that's a good spot to move because
it's on the other side of the world.

1639
01:17:40,700 --> 01:17:45,260
So if we blow this thing up and we need
somebody with a greenhouse and Sydney,

1640
01:17:45,650 --> 01:17:46,970
that's the move.
Because if,

1641
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,410
if,
if we don't make it,

1642
01:17:48,590 --> 01:17:51,410
if America doesn't make it,
like save yellowstone blows.

1643
01:17:51,910 --> 01:17:54,020
If don't blows up,
kills everybody in the continent.

1644
01:17:54,110 --> 01:17:58,040
You got to have to go somewhere where
the transition would not be that that

1645
01:17:58,041 --> 01:18:00,590
difficult.
And Australia I think is the furthest

1646
01:18:00,591 --> 01:18:02,600
away with a transition would be easy.

1647
01:18:03,290 --> 01:18:07,010
What if it got too crazy and it was way
too many people in Australia,

1648
01:18:07,011 --> 01:18:07,581
they leave.
We're like,

1649
01:18:07,581 --> 01:18:09,350
you can't.
We were cutting the border.

1650
01:18:09,351 --> 01:18:10,850
It's say do that,
you know in Australia.

1651
01:18:11,090 --> 01:18:13,940
That's one of the reasons why Australia
so awesome when a bunch of immigrants

1652
01:18:13,941 --> 01:18:16,550
show up in a boat then like not so fast
fuck face.

1653
01:18:16,551 --> 01:18:18,920
They turn them around and they sent it
to some shitty island.

1654
01:18:19,070 --> 01:18:21,320
We got home real was here and to make
him eat bugs.

1655
01:18:21,380 --> 01:18:22,370
Yeah,
it's not good.

1656
01:18:23,050 --> 01:18:25,280
It's not good.
I'm not kidding man.

1657
01:18:25,310 --> 01:18:26,390
They're brutal.
They're,

1658
01:18:26,391 --> 01:18:29,000
they're like,
they're anti immigration policy is like

1659
01:18:29,001 --> 01:18:31,850
widely criticized,
but it's one of the reasons why

1660
01:18:32,090 --> 01:18:33,290
apparently it's a,
it's,

1661
01:18:33,291 --> 01:18:35,620
so who was it that told us about that?
Josh has apps.

1662
01:18:35,630 --> 01:18:37,400
Was he the one,
the first one to tell us about that?

1663
01:18:37,710 --> 01:18:40,040
So some,
one of the guests who was from

1664
01:18:40,041 --> 01:18:40,790
Australia,
it was,

1665
01:18:40,790 --> 01:18:45,790
I believe it was josh was explaining how
crazy they are about stopping

1666
01:18:45,891 --> 01:18:46,530
immigration.

1667
01:18:46,530 --> 01:18:49,130
They just illegal immigration.
It's like a no,

1668
01:18:49,131 --> 01:18:50,720
no over there.
They just won't let it happen.

1669
01:18:50,810 --> 01:18:51,890
That wood,
that wood,

1670
01:18:52,580 --> 01:18:55,670
that's like a scene of a movie.
Something goes down here.

1671
01:18:56,300 --> 01:18:57,133
Yeah,
man.

1672
01:18:57,210 --> 01:18:59,720
These are people going down there and
then not letting you in.

1673
01:18:59,721 --> 01:19:00,610
Now there's,
sorry,

1674
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:05,360
there's so many [inaudible] world,
but there's only 20 million people in

1675
01:19:05,361 --> 01:19:08,480
all of Australia or something like that.
I think Australia itself,

1676
01:19:08,481 --> 01:19:12,110
the whole continent of Australia has the
same amount of people is California.

1677
01:19:13,580 --> 01:19:14,413
Really?
Yup.

1678
01:19:14,570 --> 01:19:17,450
And it's as big as the United States.
You can't live on a lot.

1679
01:19:17,451 --> 01:19:18,760
Is there a lot of desert there?
Well,

1680
01:19:18,780 --> 01:19:22,100
you can't if you're a pussy.
What if you're fucking man,

1681
01:19:22,110 --> 01:19:25,190
just move out in the 23 million.
So it's probably less than California.

1682
01:19:25,191 --> 01:19:27,380
Yeah.
California is probably like 30 million.

1683
01:19:27,740 --> 01:19:29,930
If I had to guess how many people are in
California?

1684
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:32,990
No official population,
it's probably gonna be a little under,

1685
01:19:32,991 --> 01:19:34,010
but easily that money.

1686
01:19:34,070 --> 01:19:35,540
Yeah.
They're not counting Mexicans either.

1687
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:37,370
No.
Friends of my Mexican friends.

1688
01:19:37,371 --> 01:19:41,420
But listen,
I wouldn't have my fucking paperwork

1689
01:19:41,421 --> 01:19:42,470
either.
Fuck it.

1690
01:19:43,310 --> 01:19:45,790
38 million of Jesus Christ,
just calc.

1691
01:19:45,810 --> 01:19:48,200
And that's not even including illegal
aliens.

1692
01:19:48,530 --> 01:19:50,090
Right.
You know,

1693
01:19:50,091 --> 01:19:53,930
another fucking crazy thing.
Somebody brought this up somewhere

1694
01:19:53,990 --> 01:19:55,520
recently.
I forget who it was.

1695
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:57,590
Maybe I read it somewhere.
Um,

1696
01:19:58,130 --> 01:20:01,340
they were talking about what percentage
of native Americans,

1697
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:03,980
uh,
like in Ra in Mexico,

1698
01:20:03,981 --> 01:20:08,981
like Mexico has a lot of people that,
a percentage of their genes are native

1699
01:20:09,331 --> 01:20:11,400
American.
The same as the people that came from

1700
01:20:11,401 --> 01:20:14,400
Siberia,
but in Mexico.

1701
01:20:14,460 --> 01:20:15,390
Yeah,
yeah.

1702
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:19,170
That I believe that genetic differences
between Mexicans and native Americans is

1703
01:20:19,171 --> 01:20:21,660
like very small.
Well,

1704
01:20:21,661 --> 01:20:24,780
there's a lot of times,
and I'm not to offend anyone,

1705
01:20:24,781 --> 01:20:29,130
I'm just being honest where I,
I can see that a lot.

1706
01:20:29,131 --> 01:20:30,000
No,
I couldn't tell.

1707
01:20:30,270 --> 01:20:34,020
Is that person Mexican or is that person
a native American?

1708
01:20:34,310 --> 01:20:36,920
I swear to God,
I just did the other day at Frickin

1709
01:20:36,930 --> 01:20:40,880
citywalk
trying to be racist and I wasn't sure

1710
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:44,820
which way to go.
How do we culturally appropriate that's

1711
01:20:44,821 --> 01:20:49,280
a barrel or a feather
and I know it.

1712
01:20:49,310 --> 01:20:52,020
Yeah,
makes sense.

1713
01:20:52,050 --> 01:20:53,340
Yeah.
They all came down from Asia

1714
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:57,060
along with all these fucking crazy
animals.

1715
01:20:57,061 --> 01:20:58,770
And this Guy Dan Flores is talking
about,

1716
01:20:59,610 --> 01:21:01,710
they had a single,
a short face bear.

1717
01:21:01,890 --> 01:21:02,760
Is that what it's called?
Jamie?

1718
01:21:04,140 --> 01:21:08,010
Short face bear is fucking enormous,
terrifying bear that they think was one

1719
01:21:08,011 --> 01:21:11,160
of the reasons why people didn't come to
North America sooner because there were

1720
01:21:11,161 --> 01:21:13,290
so dangerous.
There were huge like bigger than

1721
01:21:13,291 --> 01:21:17,250
grizzlies and super predatory and so
like when people were coming across the

1722
01:21:17,251 --> 01:21:19,170
bering strait there,
it's probably just getting picked off.

1723
01:21:19,350 --> 01:21:24,330
Oh look at that thing.
Oh look at it's giant and it's chasing

1724
01:21:24,331 --> 01:21:27,150
down a buffalo in this photo.
Some youtube videos.

1725
01:21:27,151 --> 01:21:30,510
Fuck yeah,
the Chrissy just chasing the moose down

1726
01:21:30,511 --> 01:21:31,410
the street.
Yeah.

1727
01:21:32,130 --> 01:21:33,900
It just takes him down and he's,
he's,

1728
01:21:34,170 --> 01:21:37,350
he knows he's going to get them loose.
Is half eaten,

1729
01:21:37,650 --> 01:21:40,380
still running?
Just looking back.

1730
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:41,940
He's sick.
I'm going to catch up to you.

1731
01:21:44,010 --> 01:21:45,630
It's fricking,
it's horrifying.

1732
01:21:45,660 --> 01:21:48,750
It's scary,
but it's also real god,

1733
01:21:48,751 --> 01:21:51,270
these things still exist and can eat you
at any moment.

1734
01:21:51,271 --> 01:21:53,520
We still part of the wild and all we
are,

1735
01:21:53,521 --> 01:21:56,700
we've just made cities.
Here's one that's the one I'm talking

1736
01:21:56,701 --> 01:22:00,510
about chasing this buffalo giant ass
grizzlies chasing the buffalo.

1737
01:22:00,540 --> 01:22:05,540
He's half torn up already so big and say
that that buffalo got burned in some

1738
01:22:07,471 --> 01:22:10,440
sort of a volcanic fire or something
like that.

1739
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:12,960
That was,
that was an already injured buffalo.

1740
01:22:13,470 --> 01:22:15,510
Look at him.
He's already had enough.

1741
01:22:15,570 --> 01:22:17,930
Oh God.
They're so terrifying.

1742
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:20,910
Look at his mouth.
He's foaming is foaming.

1743
01:22:21,060 --> 01:22:22,080
Look,
he's got an air.

1744
01:22:22,710 --> 01:22:24,180
Oh,
he's in the air dude.

1745
01:22:24,750 --> 01:22:28,940
And he probably weighs 500 pounds and he
leased and he's booking it done street

1746
01:22:29,130 --> 01:22:30,870
shit.
He probably was more than 500 pounds.

1747
01:22:30,950 --> 01:22:34,200
That's a buffalo.
He's probably like six or 700 pounds.

1748
01:22:34,530 --> 01:22:35,730
What am I guessing?
What do you wait,

1749
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:39,280
what am I fat shaming a bear.
Why might,

1750
01:22:39,281 --> 01:22:40,114
why don't care?
Anyways,

1751
01:22:40,860 --> 01:22:43,080
I'm obsessed with a number.
Did you see,

1752
01:22:43,081 --> 01:22:44,760
um,
I don't know if you're watching this.

1753
01:22:44,761 --> 01:22:46,970
I just watched it on the plane.
Uh,

1754
01:22:47,460 --> 01:22:51,330
what's the Leonardo Dicaprio one?
Where he gets told the revenant?

1755
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:52,340
Yeah.
The,

1756
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:54,480
did you see the scene?
Yeah,

1757
01:22:54,690 --> 01:22:56,040
the bear scene.
Yeah.

1758
01:22:57,780 --> 01:23:00,570
That's the first time I actually,
I don't know what you think of it,

1759
01:23:00,571 --> 01:23:04,890
but that's the first time where I saw
how quick that can ha they,

1760
01:23:05,020 --> 01:23:07,300
I thought they made it real how a bear
can just,

1761
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:09,100
yeah,
within a second he's on,

1762
01:23:09,101 --> 01:23:13,150
he was over there so big and they move
so much faster than a person can.

1763
01:23:13,180 --> 01:23:13,900
We,
we,

1764
01:23:13,900 --> 01:23:16,120
we judge everything based on what we can
do.

1765
01:23:16,540 --> 01:23:19,480
Like we see an animal way like okay via
to run towards him right now.

1766
01:23:19,481 --> 01:23:22,360
How long would it take?
But the timeline that an animal can

1767
01:23:22,361 --> 01:23:26,140
close in on you versus what you can do
to them is so goddamn different.

1768
01:23:26,330 --> 01:23:28,600
Like you just don't understand how fast
they are.

1769
01:23:31,230 --> 01:23:36,210
Spat all my rage.
I am still just a rat cage where you

1770
01:23:36,211 --> 01:23:39,390
live in New Jersey.
New Jersey got a crazy bear problem.

1771
01:23:39,810 --> 01:23:41,700
They're overrun with bears in some
areas.

1772
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:42,683
Um,

1773
01:23:44,730 --> 01:23:47,520
there's bears but they're black bears.
Yeah.

1774
01:23:47,521 --> 01:23:51,360
No one not as scary.
They get spooked out really easily.

1775
01:23:52,260 --> 01:23:54,510
They're scavengers.
They're just looking for garbage.

1776
01:23:54,511 --> 01:23:56,790
They don't care about you.
They are for the most part.

1777
01:23:57,810 --> 01:24:00,240
They definitely do term predatory though
when they get really hungry.

1778
01:24:00,300 --> 01:24:04,320
Some of them are predatory.
I know a guy who was camping with some

1779
01:24:04,321 --> 01:24:06,270
dude.
It was his first hunting trip and he got

1780
01:24:06,271 --> 01:24:10,140
attacked in his tent by a 500 pound
predatory black bear.

1781
01:24:10,950 --> 01:24:12,990
Huge hungry,
older black bear.

1782
01:24:13,030 --> 01:24:15,240
Just took a chance.
Went in the tent,

1783
01:24:15,320 --> 01:24:16,800
just try to Jack.
I'm in his tent.

1784
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:20,100
His friends shot the bear,
shot through the bear and hit him in the

1785
01:24:20,101 --> 01:24:22,380
wrist.
So he wound up getting a broken wrist

1786
01:24:22,381 --> 01:24:24,540
from the,
from the rifle and they,

1787
01:24:24,541 --> 01:24:27,330
uh,
chase the bear out of the tent and shot

1788
01:24:27,331 --> 01:24:29,490
it in the woods.
Wow.

1789
01:24:30,030 --> 01:24:32,220
How about that for your first fucking
camping trip?

1790
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:35,470
Totally.
No,

1791
01:24:35,820 --> 01:24:40,470
you're not going to see animals bears
here of these fine.

1792
01:24:40,710 --> 01:24:42,810
Most of the time nothing happens.
Most of the time they run away,

1793
01:24:42,811 --> 01:24:45,270
but they killed that kid at rutgers was
like a year and a half ago.

1794
01:24:45,750 --> 01:24:46,410
A kid,
uh,

1795
01:24:46,410 --> 01:24:48,450
who got eaten that rutgers.
Rutgers,

1796
01:24:48,890 --> 01:24:50,100
yeah.
He was outside of rug kid.

1797
01:24:50,190 --> 01:24:52,830
Kid from rutgers outside in the woods
and,

1798
01:24:52,831 --> 01:24:54,750
uh,
took a photo of the bay or right before

1799
01:24:54,751 --> 01:24:57,210
it ate them too.
They've got a photo of the very bare

1800
01:24:57,211 --> 01:25:00,240
that one up killing him.
Apparently they ran and they saw the

1801
01:25:00,241 --> 01:25:03,300
bear and they freaked out and ran when
they ran the bear chased them.

1802
01:25:04,950 --> 01:25:06,570
And uh,
one of them.

1803
01:25:06,590 --> 01:25:08,130
What can a bear,
was it black bear?

1804
01:25:08,820 --> 01:25:10,080
Black Bear?
You know,

1805
01:25:10,081 --> 01:25:13,690
they ate meritus hiker,
snap photo of bear before fatal attack

1806
01:25:13,691 --> 01:25:16,080
and West Milford.
That's the bear right there.

1807
01:25:18,140 --> 01:25:19,130
Yeah.
I mean if you,

1808
01:25:19,370 --> 01:25:22,280
if they have an opportunity to eat you,
then each year they eat each other.

1809
01:25:22,430 --> 01:25:25,130
I mean,
if you kill black bear and leave it

1810
01:25:25,131 --> 01:25:26,450
there,
the other one's lead it.

1811
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:27,890
Wow.
That's scary.

1812
01:25:27,970 --> 01:25:30,170
And they're gangster.
That's near my house.

1813
01:25:30,470 --> 01:25:31,190
Well,
there's,

1814
01:25:31,190 --> 01:25:33,680
that's a real animal dude.
I mean,

1815
01:25:33,681 --> 01:25:37,130
you guys have a lot of them in New
Jersey and we saw him a couple of times

1816
01:25:37,131 --> 01:25:38,420
in the last two,
three years.

1817
01:25:38,670 --> 01:25:42,770
They would come up on my back deck and
tear down the a bird feeder.

1818
01:25:42,860 --> 01:25:44,570
Whoa.
Just right outside the,

1819
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:46,670
it's,
and they're big creatures.

1820
01:25:46,820 --> 01:25:48,080
Yeah.
How big was the one you saw?

1821
01:25:48,680 --> 01:25:50,600
Um,
maybe like,

1822
01:25:50,950 --> 01:25:53,390
like a big dog.
No,

1823
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:55,830
it's a little bigger than it is.
Bigger than a dog.

1824
01:25:55,860 --> 01:25:58,520
Like a couple hundred pounds.
Probably some 300.

1825
01:26:00,790 --> 01:26:02,420
That's a fucking big animal,
man.

1826
01:26:02,660 --> 01:26:04,370
Look at that.
Holy Shit.

1827
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:06,890
Bear takes a dip and New Jersey's family
pool.

1828
01:26:06,980 --> 01:26:08,570
Yeah.
That's a big one too,

1829
01:26:08,571 --> 01:26:10,550
man.
God Damn.

1830
01:26:10,551 --> 01:26:13,190
That's a very big ass bear to find
swimming.

1831
01:26:13,191 --> 01:26:16,400
You're fucking pool my net.
Holy Shit.

1832
01:26:16,470 --> 01:26:18,200
The size of them.
Yeah.

1833
01:26:19,940 --> 01:26:24,140
See that's a mature old bear.
That doesn't give a fuck.

1834
01:26:24,860 --> 01:26:26,690
Right.
That's just so weird.

1835
01:26:26,691 --> 01:26:29,450
They live with people in New Jersey of
all places.

1836
01:26:29,810 --> 01:26:30,890
There's one,
there's two.

1837
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:33,230
There's two wacky black ones.
There's um,

1838
01:26:34,070 --> 01:26:39,070
there's a good video in my nephew's
neighborhood where the two black bears

1839
01:26:39,771 --> 01:26:40,790
are going at it.
Oh,

1840
01:26:40,791 --> 01:26:41,830
far rockaway.
Yeah,

1841
01:26:41,890 --> 01:26:46,890
the one that we played that before.
And then there's one in Jersey that

1842
01:26:47,001 --> 01:26:48,740
walks on its hind legs.
Yeah.

1843
01:26:48,910 --> 01:26:49,910
Did you see that one?
Yeah,

1844
01:26:49,970 --> 01:26:50,803
it's big foot,
bro.

1845
01:26:51,820 --> 01:26:56,660
That's a big foot,
big foot video for you.

1846
01:26:57,140 --> 01:26:59,300
I think that's exactly what those were
saying.

1847
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:01,130
Bears can do that apparently all the
time.

1848
01:27:01,190 --> 01:27:03,920
They can walk on their hind legs.
They just don't do it very often.

1849
01:27:04,550 --> 01:27:06,890
Look at that thing.
That's weird.

1850
01:27:06,980 --> 01:27:08,330
Yeah,
but he walks through the neighborhood

1851
01:27:08,331 --> 01:27:11,150
like that.
If you were like at dusk,

1852
01:27:11,290 --> 01:27:12,123
right?
Right.

1853
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:16,400
And it was really dark out and you saw
that thing walking through buck glint of

1854
01:27:16,401 --> 01:27:18,680
moonlight,
you would swear it was a giant gorilla.

1855
01:27:19,070 --> 01:27:20,300
Yeah,
that's big foot.

1856
01:27:21,050 --> 01:27:22,460
I listen.
Yeah,

1857
01:27:22,490 --> 01:27:26,000
I know him before I joked at big foot,
but I saw him last night.

1858
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:28,250
It's like a dead thing.
But for real,

1859
01:27:28,251 --> 01:27:30,710
like a black bear can easily get to be
seven feet.

1860
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:32,110
Yeah.
So if,

1861
01:27:32,140 --> 01:27:34,640
if you got a seven foot black bear it
and you see it walking through the

1862
01:27:34,641 --> 01:27:36,290
woods,
or even a fucking six and a half foot

1863
01:27:36,291 --> 01:27:38,680
black bear when she get her pants.
Yeah,

1864
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:41,450
you're going to swear it's way bigger
than it was just walking on his hind

1865
01:27:41,451 --> 01:27:42,200
legs.

1866
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:46,970
Nobody ever underestimates or giant two
foot to walking on two legs.

1867
01:27:46,971 --> 01:27:49,080
Gorilla.
You don't underestimate the size of the

1868
01:27:49,081 --> 01:27:50,180
thing.
You overestimate it.

1869
01:27:50,690 --> 01:27:51,410
Right.
You know,

1870
01:27:51,410 --> 01:27:52,580
if it's six feet tall,
he's like,

1871
01:27:52,581 --> 01:27:55,060
he was fucking eight feet tall,
right?

1872
01:27:55,250 --> 01:27:57,710
Yeah.
Oh my God.

1873
01:27:58,140 --> 01:28:00,860
New Jersey is pretty rural.
People don't realize that.

1874
01:28:00,861 --> 01:28:05,861
They think of New Jersey as being like,
like were Tony Soprano loved or they

1875
01:28:06,261 --> 01:28:09,350
think it's Newark Airport.
Hoboken.

1876
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:10,550
Hoboken.
Yeah.

1877
01:28:10,710 --> 01:28:14,240
There's a lot of woods in Jersey.
And you also have the shore and the

1878
01:28:14,240 --> 01:28:18,160
Jersey Devil and Jersey Devil.
I've uh,

1879
01:28:18,260 --> 01:28:21,410
I might've heard of him.
I might've heard them.

1880
01:28:22,430 --> 01:28:23,810
What does it sound like?
Um,

1881
01:28:24,290 --> 01:28:27,950
it's a little bit like a screech owl.
Ooh.

1882
01:28:27,980 --> 01:28:30,310
Yeah.
Screech owl.

1883
01:28:31,130 --> 01:28:32,630
It could be,
that's a problem.

1884
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:38,870
There it is.
This the devil.

1885
01:28:39,050 --> 01:28:41,330
It looks like a camel.
Fucked a dragon.

1886
01:28:41,650 --> 01:28:44,600
Now I will say this.
I will say this,

1887
01:28:44,601 --> 01:28:49,601
one night my wife and I were sleeping
and on the roof.

1888
01:28:49,960 --> 01:28:54,620
That was really did have,
it sounded like something landed on that

1889
01:28:54,621 --> 01:28:55,610
roof.
That was me,

1890
01:28:55,611 --> 01:28:56,444
bro.
Nah,

1891
01:28:57,140 --> 01:28:57,760
look at it.
It's got,

1892
01:28:57,760 --> 01:29:00,380
it's a goat with wings.
Is that the Jersey Devil call it is

1893
01:29:00,381 --> 01:29:01,710
that,
was that the photo?

1894
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:04,110
Look at this.
See,

1895
01:29:04,111 --> 01:29:05,010
here's the thing,
right?

1896
01:29:05,070 --> 01:29:08,400
Jersey devil doesn't scare me as much as
the fucking alligator that pulls babies

1897
01:29:08,401 --> 01:29:11,640
out of a Disneyland and drags them into
the lagoon.

1898
01:29:11,910 --> 01:29:13,290
That's a real thing.
That's,

1899
01:29:13,320 --> 01:29:15,450
can you,
can you imagine a,

1900
01:29:15,451 --> 01:29:17,700
it just,
I've been in that with my kids.

1901
01:29:19,190 --> 01:29:21,720
I've been in that they need to have
signs.

1902
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:25,200
I think they do.
It says don't go on the water.

1903
01:29:25,240 --> 01:29:26,790
It didn't say that's filled with
dinosaurs.

1904
01:29:27,270 --> 01:29:29,910
Didn't say this man eating dinosaurs in
there.

1905
01:29:30,360 --> 01:29:32,640
That's where I think the problem's going
to lie for them.

1906
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:35,100
Where if you're from Florida,
I still live there.

1907
01:29:35,101 --> 01:29:36,840
We you have you heard about it all the
time.

1908
01:29:36,841 --> 01:29:39,690
Small dogs.
Two year old toddler.

1909
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:42,810
I lived there too.
I lived in Gainesville between ages.

1910
01:29:43,980 --> 01:29:44,813
What,
what,

1911
01:29:44,950 --> 01:29:48,360
what year was it?
It was like the early seventies.

1912
01:29:48,361 --> 01:29:50,820
We lived there for like three years at a
you youngsville.

1913
01:29:50,850 --> 01:29:52,320
Yeah,
and uh,

1914
01:29:52,410 --> 01:29:54,420
round Lake Alice.
He'll look at that thing.

1915
01:29:54,500 --> 01:29:54,961
Yeah.
Oh,

1916
01:29:54,961 --> 01:29:55,860
they climb fences.
Now,

1917
01:29:55,861 --> 01:29:58,380
have you seen this?
This is so scary,

1918
01:29:58,440 --> 01:30:01,620
but I talked about this in the podcast
recently when I was a kid and we lived

1919
01:30:01,621 --> 01:30:03,750
there.
They were endangered and so you couldn't

1920
01:30:03,751 --> 01:30:04,950
hunt them.
Nobody hunted them.

1921
01:30:05,490 --> 01:30:09,030
And now they have so many of them that
they give out hunting tags.

1922
01:30:09,090 --> 01:30:11,520
Like for that swamp people show you ever
watch that show?

1923
01:30:11,530 --> 01:30:14,660
The kill alligators?
That guy had 500 tax.

1924
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:18,060
He could kill $500 how many fucking
alligators do they have when you give

1925
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:20,440
someone 500 tags?
Yeah,

1926
01:30:20,441 --> 01:30:21,810
it's crazy.
It's a real problem.

1927
01:30:21,811 --> 01:30:23,520
Then I would say,
so look at this guy.

1928
01:30:23,550 --> 01:30:26,400
He's climbing a fence.
Jesus Christ.

1929
01:30:27,300 --> 01:30:31,110
Look at that fucking thing.
I mean that is straight out of,

1930
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:32,700
that's the Chinese hundred million years
ago.

1931
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:34,110
Yeah,
that's a dinosaur.

1932
01:30:34,111 --> 01:30:37,050
I don't think they've changed in a
hundred million years or something crazy

1933
01:30:37,051 --> 01:30:39,690
like that.
There's some nutty number.

1934
01:30:39,860 --> 01:30:41,790
It's like 50 million,
something like that.

1935
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:46,500
Like how long dinosaurs are a alligators
have been exactly the same.

1936
01:30:47,700 --> 01:30:50,010
You're just food.
Just food.

1937
01:30:50,700 --> 01:30:51,800
That's all you are.
I don't see,

1938
01:30:51,810 --> 01:30:54,890
I don't see your wife or kids.
I just see food.

1939
01:30:54,891 --> 01:30:57,840
It's not like you look at the baby deer
with the Mama dear and you go,

1940
01:30:57,850 --> 01:30:59,910
I can't shoot her.
She's got the baby.

1941
01:31:00,830 --> 01:31:03,570
You're about the splash about and
alligator that someone posted this video

1942
01:31:03,571 --> 01:31:04,340
of what?

1943
01:31:04,340 --> 01:31:07,380
What?
This alligator was like right next to a

1944
01:31:07,680 --> 01:31:09,300
splash mountain.
I'll pull up that way.

1945
01:31:09,570 --> 01:31:12,070
There's a worker in Disney.
Watch all,

1946
01:31:12,090 --> 01:31:13,710
Gosh,
I'll close the people get to it.

1947
01:31:14,020 --> 01:31:14,980
Let's call.
It was like,

1948
01:31:14,981 --> 01:31:16,740
wow,
I can get away with a stick.

1949
01:31:16,920 --> 01:31:20,690
Why like 2009 I think.
Oh,

1950
01:31:20,730 --> 01:31:23,490
how do you not just kill that thing?
You got to kill it.

1951
01:31:24,260 --> 01:31:24,670
Look,
it's,

1952
01:31:24,670 --> 01:31:26,430
it's little enough right now that you
can kill it.

1953
01:31:26,431 --> 01:31:29,260
That's a little baby alligator.
Get to it as well.

1954
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:31,050
That's a small alligator,
right?

1955
01:31:31,830 --> 01:31:35,880
Oh No.
Loud right next to it.

1956
01:31:36,060 --> 01:31:37,560
He's right next to it.
Yeah,

1957
01:31:37,590 --> 01:31:39,780
look,
oh my God.

1958
01:31:39,930 --> 01:31:41,880
They just tolerate that kind of Shit in
Florida.

1959
01:31:41,881 --> 01:31:43,890
That seems like a really little
alligator by the way.

1960
01:31:44,220 --> 01:31:46,110
He's little,
but he could do a little damage.

1961
01:31:46,111 --> 01:31:48,240
Fuck that alligator up.
I'll tell you right now.

1962
01:31:48,241 --> 01:31:50,760
I will fuck that alligator up.
I'll grab it by its tail.

1963
01:31:51,070 --> 01:31:53,010
Now.
Bounces head right off that sidewalk

1964
01:31:53,100 --> 01:31:55,950
over and over again.
They'll turn it into a Dick Holster.

1965
01:31:58,830 --> 01:32:00,550
I'll make him cradled my balls

1966
01:32:00,700 --> 01:32:03,280
for the rest of time.
Look at this guy.

1967
01:32:03,281 --> 01:32:04,870
He's going to get a net and try to scoop
it up.

1968
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:09,490
What does his asshole dude with a net,
you need a gun son scale like the end of

1969
01:32:09,491 --> 01:32:11,950
the pool skimmer.
Go get yourself a crossbow,

1970
01:32:12,790 --> 01:32:13,990
shoot that fucking thing.
Right.

1971
01:32:13,991 --> 01:32:16,690
And it's caveman brain.
Caveman brain.

1972
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:18,730
Wow.
What's wrong with me?

1973
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:20,470
That's a,
that's a lizard.

1974
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:25,150
I mean that's a heartless,
thoughtless creature that exists to eat

1975
01:32:25,151 --> 01:32:30,151
things to say it's all does that coming
to this is more of now than they've ever

1976
01:32:30,281 --> 01:32:34,570
been before and this trend continues.
You got a real fucking problem because

1977
01:32:34,780 --> 01:32:37,300
when I was living there,
so I'm trying to figure out what year I

1978
01:32:37,301 --> 01:32:42,040
was born in 67 we lived in Florida until
I was a law.

1979
01:32:42,070 --> 01:32:44,080
No,
we lived in San Francisco from age seven

1980
01:32:44,081 --> 01:32:48,640
to 11 so I was 11 years old,
somewhere around then what year was

1981
01:32:48,641 --> 01:32:49,060
that?

1982
01:32:49,060 --> 01:32:51,250
What year?
[inaudible] 73 I'm way too stupid.

1983
01:32:51,370 --> 01:32:53,650
If it was 73 probably about five years
old.

1984
01:32:53,651 --> 01:32:54,520
Six,
seven years.

1985
01:32:55,750 --> 01:32:58,980
73 Oh six yeah.
So swimming on,

1986
01:32:59,050 --> 01:33:03,430
so somewhere around some,
we're talking somewhere around 1977

1987
01:33:03,580 --> 01:33:04,061
okay.
Okay.

1988
01:33:04,061 --> 01:33:07,320
So you like 10 to 12 these are kind of
prime ready to go.

1989
01:33:07,490 --> 01:33:12,310
So just think about this year,
1977 now think about 2016 so in 77

1990
01:33:12,311 --> 01:33:15,460
they're protected.
In 2016 you can kill 500 of them.

1991
01:33:15,700 --> 01:33:19,180
What the fuck is it going to be like 50
years from now?

1992
01:33:19,240 --> 01:33:24,100
What is it going to be like in 2066 you
had to be able to go anywhere near there

1993
01:33:24,280 --> 01:33:27,730
or is it just going to be some crazy
Congo type situation where every time

1994
01:33:27,731 --> 01:33:29,410
you get out of your car,
so I'm just trying to eat you and kill

1995
01:33:29,411 --> 01:33:34,100
you?
I think they're going to the Amera coble

1996
01:33:34,390 --> 01:33:39,370
under the guise of president trump,
president trump will guide us.

1997
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:42,130
He lives in Florida.
I live in Florida.

1998
01:33:45,400 --> 01:33:48,250
We will kill them all.
We will have golf.

1999
01:33:50,180 --> 01:33:51,460
He likes golf,
right?

2000
01:33:51,640 --> 01:33:54,160
He's a golf guy.
Guys get golf courses and shitty

2001
01:33:54,161 --> 01:33:55,360
designs,
golf courses.

2002
01:33:55,700 --> 01:33:59,410
So he's not going to tolerate people
getting eaten by what if like Jack

2003
01:33:59,410 --> 01:34:01,720
Nicholas,
one of those older dudes was at an event

2004
01:34:02,380 --> 01:34:04,660
and something just debt,
big 15 foot of that.

2005
01:34:04,661 --> 01:34:08,410
They got on video the other day.
She says enough is enough and jumps out

2006
01:34:08,411 --> 01:34:13,411
and grabs him right by as polyester
pants right by the deck just right over

2007
01:34:14,200 --> 01:34:19,200
back front from where the eyes are,
the Dick side and then the bottom is on

2008
01:34:20,201 --> 01:34:24,340
the asshole side and just clamps him
right up the middle like a paper clip

2009
01:34:24,730 --> 01:34:28,540
and drags me the rights.
Flips him a couple times because it

2010
01:34:28,541 --> 01:34:33,220
doesn't give a fuck about CBS filming.
Some golf show doesn't give a fuck.

2011
01:34:33,370 --> 01:34:37,240
It's not going to not kill you because
this is a CBS Golf Day.

2012
01:34:38,230 --> 01:34:39,760
That's right.
Why?

2013
01:34:39,761 --> 01:34:43,930
The women are doing wonderful today.
Women golfers have really come a long

2014
01:34:43,931 --> 01:34:45,460
way.
Oh Jesus.

2015
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:48,460
Alligator comes out,
eats a lesbian drags,

2016
01:34:49,090 --> 01:34:53,350
just drag it right into the water.
It doesn't give a fuck about your show.

2017
01:34:54,600 --> 01:34:58,010
It's going to 50 million year old brain.
This is three brain cells and they're

2018
01:34:58,011 --> 01:35:00,620
just trying to find things.
Things that can eat,

2019
01:35:00,860 --> 01:35:01,611
eat,
eat,

2020
01:35:01,611 --> 01:35:02,450
fuck,
eat,

2021
01:35:02,451 --> 01:35:05,030
fuck,
take nap in water.

2022
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:10,720
They found Nile crocodiles in Florida.
Yeah,

2023
01:35:11,060 --> 01:35:13,730
they found quite a few of them.
They have a shoot on sight thing for

2024
01:35:13,731 --> 01:35:15,850
Nile crocodiles now.
I said,

2025
01:35:15,860 --> 01:35:17,750
you see him?
You have to kill them because they're

2026
01:35:17,751 --> 01:35:18,800
already,
they've already found,

2027
01:35:18,830 --> 01:35:21,980
I believe they found four and uh,
it's,

2028
01:35:22,040 --> 01:35:24,410
they're definitely laying eggs.
They're definitely breeding.

2029
01:35:24,950 --> 01:35:26,870
And uh,
if they found four,

2030
01:35:26,900 --> 01:35:29,570
there could be hundreds.
Like they literally don't know how many

2031
01:35:29,571 --> 01:35:32,780
Nile crocodiles there are in Florida and
you're not going to radically cut them.

2032
01:35:32,781 --> 01:35:35,500
So you just have to do your best try to
curb the population.

2033
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:38,990
It is like modern day Tarzan Shit.
Oh yeah.

2034
01:35:39,360 --> 01:35:43,930
Hi.
Drive to civilized ours just to people

2035
01:35:45,130 --> 01:35:46,050
fun.
The beginning.

2036
01:35:46,970 --> 01:35:51,970
Now we put the jumbo to them.
Why do you think it's a coincidence?

2037
01:35:53,181 --> 01:35:57,170
And it's all happening in Florida and
then the 10 Tony Montana,

2038
01:35:57,410 --> 01:35:59,330
cocaine cowboys,
all the coke,

2039
01:35:59,331 --> 01:36:00,164
all the pills.

2040
01:36:00,170 --> 01:36:02,960
Okay.
All the oxies Florida gave out more oxy

2041
01:36:02,961 --> 01:36:04,910
prescriptions and the rest of the
country combined.

2042
01:36:05,030 --> 01:36:05,863
Really?
Oh yeah.

2043
01:36:06,050 --> 01:36:09,500
All that Shit's going on there with
alligators and Nile crocodiles and

2044
01:36:09,501 --> 01:36:14,000
fucking vipers in people's yards.
All these crazy snakes and pythons and

2045
01:36:14,001 --> 01:36:15,950
people just add,
I don't want to take any of it anymore.

2046
01:36:16,130 --> 01:36:17,640
They throw it out there fucking back
door.

2047
01:36:18,920 --> 01:36:20,330
That's what they did in Florida,
right?

2048
01:36:20,331 --> 01:36:21,820
The pythons.
Yeah.

2049
01:36:22,160 --> 01:36:26,330
10 1520 I get huge and they eat people.
Oh yeah.

2050
01:36:26,630 --> 01:36:28,580
Fuck yeah.
The elite people lead everything.

2051
01:36:28,610 --> 01:36:29,960
You go to sleep.
That's another thing.

2052
01:36:29,990 --> 01:36:34,940
Just lives.
Eat and sizes you up makes its way

2053
01:36:34,941 --> 01:36:38,960
through your air ventilation system.
It's as fat as the pipe that your air

2054
01:36:38,961 --> 01:36:41,540
condition comes out.
Look at this Nile crocodile identified

2055
01:36:41,541 --> 01:36:44,120
in south Florida.
Jesus Christ is just last month.

2056
01:36:44,121 --> 01:36:46,400
This is another one.
Fuck Man,

2057
01:36:46,430 --> 01:36:51,430
those are 21st God damn dangerous there.
The the willdabeast.

2058
01:36:52,671 --> 01:36:55,430
Exactly.
They're really a scary because there are

2059
01:36:55,431 --> 01:37:00,200
way bigger and way more aggressive.
Like you can't be anywhere near them.

2060
01:37:00,201 --> 01:37:02,630
They're very different like temperament
wise and alligators.

2061
01:37:02,750 --> 01:37:05,230
Send them beast.
Yes,

2062
01:37:05,410 --> 01:37:06,080
yes.
Let's go.

2063
01:37:06,080 --> 01:37:11,080
We don't have weapons.
Allowed them to buy their own piece and

2064
01:37:11,421 --> 01:37:14,770
they'll leash them upon themselves.
I love that.

2065
01:37:14,771 --> 01:37:17,750
Dot.
Did them unleash their own punishment to

2066
01:37:17,751 --> 01:37:20,670
their stupidity.
They'll weaknesses creed.

2067
01:37:20,970 --> 01:37:23,840
They will continue to the [inaudible]
themselves.

2068
01:37:23,870 --> 01:37:26,060
What about the ones who are strong?
Get them pills,

2069
01:37:26,240 --> 01:37:28,910
make them weak.
Oxycontin.

2070
01:37:30,950 --> 01:37:32,780
Oxy doesn't sound like something though.
Kill Ya.

2071
01:37:33,060 --> 01:37:35,720
Sounds like a cool chick that we know
she plays in a band.

2072
01:37:35,930 --> 01:37:36,770
Hey,
where's oxy?

2073
01:37:37,390 --> 01:37:40,490
Oh Ah,
oxen went to visit her family in Sweden.

2074
01:37:40,550 --> 01:37:41,211
Oh,
that's cool.

2075
01:37:41,211 --> 01:37:44,210
She's a bad ass.
That's oxen.

2076
01:37:44,630 --> 01:37:48,320
I see.
Beautiful Hair.

2077
01:37:48,500 --> 01:37:51,830
Big Smile.
It was like a scooby doo band.

2078
01:37:52,160 --> 01:37:55,020
Oxy would be like their friend that
comes over and plays along with them.

2079
01:37:55,230 --> 01:37:56,063
You know,
she's just,

2080
01:37:56,180 --> 01:37:59,070
this is not even a hint of any sexual
attraction with anybody.

2081
01:37:59,630 --> 01:38:01,140
Knocks.
He doesn't fuck no one fucks.

2082
01:38:01,320 --> 01:38:03,810
No.
She just makes the situation better.

2083
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:04,230
Yeah.
Yeah.

2084
01:38:04,230 --> 01:38:06,810
She's just cool.
She comes back over and the band plays

2085
01:38:06,811 --> 01:38:11,811
cool song and credits roll programming
programmed America and fed them

2086
01:38:12,691 --> 01:38:14,700
alligators.
Apparently alligators tastes really

2087
01:38:14,701 --> 01:38:16,230
good.
No they don't.

2088
01:38:16,500 --> 01:38:17,340
No,
no.

2089
01:38:17,670 --> 01:38:19,560
What makes you say that you've eaten
them in flow?

2090
01:38:19,570 --> 01:38:20,940
At least that's what they said they
were.

2091
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:22,880
Oh,
like you've had like those alligator

2092
01:38:22,890 --> 01:38:25,400
tail and fried gator.
Yeah.

2093
01:38:25,710 --> 01:38:28,200
Got to eat it fresh and say gotta eat it
fresh,

2094
01:38:28,230 --> 01:38:32,730
but apparently has more protein per
pound of meat than any other wild game.

2095
01:38:32,940 --> 01:38:33,580
Really?
Yeah.

2096
01:38:33,580 --> 01:38:36,150
It's like his is up there as high as
anything else,

2097
01:38:36,151 --> 01:38:41,151
like higher than even like elk and um,
and buffalo and bison and things like

2098
01:38:41,371 --> 01:38:42,270
that.
I hated it.

2099
01:38:42,480 --> 01:38:43,090
Ah,
see,

2100
01:38:43,090 --> 01:38:43,710
find the find out.

2101
01:38:43,710 --> 01:38:45,480
That's true.
I don't want a lot of people it was,

2102
01:38:45,570 --> 01:38:47,790
it was added to he,
yeah,

2103
01:38:48,090 --> 01:38:49,440
I thought it tastes like shit.
She,

2104
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:51,780
but I think that's because it's prepared
bad.

2105
01:38:51,930 --> 01:38:55,140
I think you're getting it from some sort
of a like a fucking Fridays or something

2106
01:38:55,141 --> 01:38:56,430
like that.
Like kind of a chain.

2107
01:38:56,640 --> 01:39:01,640
They say if you get it the right way
fresh and then cook it like the correct

2108
01:39:01,801 --> 01:39:04,290
way,
it's apparently very delicious or

2109
01:39:04,291 --> 01:39:05,580
probably just,
yeah.

2110
01:39:05,820 --> 01:39:06,720
Yeah.
You're probably right.

2111
01:39:07,620 --> 01:39:10,500
I might've get it cause I didn't,
I remember the restaurant was like a

2112
01:39:10,501 --> 01:39:11,700
special,
so it was fine.

2113
01:39:11,701 --> 01:39:14,950
Like a trial run in some guy's cousin.
Like trust me,

2114
01:39:14,951 --> 01:39:16,490
you just cut these up.
Yeah,

2115
01:39:16,540 --> 01:39:18,060
you fry them.
They're amazing.

2116
01:39:18,061 --> 01:39:22,140
46 grams of protein per serving,
so holy shit,

2117
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:25,260
that's insane.
Let's start eating them.

2118
01:39:25,290 --> 01:39:27,810
That's incredible.
I think that's way more than anything

2119
01:39:27,811 --> 01:39:29,430
else.
If that's okay,

2120
01:39:29,490 --> 01:39:32,490
I'll find something new and meet the
other meat.

2121
01:39:32,640 --> 01:39:36,440
That's incredible.
Hold on.

2122
01:39:36,550 --> 01:39:40,780
Well this is only 3.2 ounces for 3.2
ounces.

2123
01:39:40,781 --> 01:39:43,900
It's 46 grams of protein.
That's insane.

2124
01:39:45,910 --> 01:39:46,721
That is what it says,
right?

2125
01:39:46,721 --> 01:39:48,090
It says 3.2 ounces.
Yeah,

2126
01:39:48,640 --> 01:39:49,900
dude,
that's incredible.

2127
01:39:51,430 --> 01:39:54,190
That's the main,
it makes sense.

2128
01:39:54,520 --> 01:39:57,340
You're reading a goddamn dinosaur
dinosaur.

2129
01:39:57,520 --> 01:40:00,770
You eating its tail.
That's what you eat.

2130
01:40:00,780 --> 01:40:01,990
It's all,
yeah,

2131
01:40:02,080 --> 01:40:04,270
it's all muscle to cut it up into like
steaks.

2132
01:40:06,040 --> 01:40:07,240
That'd be prepared.
Good though.

2133
01:40:07,450 --> 01:40:08,141
Yeah,
I would.

2134
01:40:08,141 --> 01:40:09,460
I would like to try it.
I mean,

2135
01:40:09,461 --> 01:40:11,020
I'm just talking out of my ass.
What's that?

2136
01:40:11,021 --> 01:40:15,640
Much as a domestic beef and for the city
twice as much as domestic beef.

2137
01:40:16,150 --> 01:40:17,740
Well,
why don't we feed people fucking

2138
01:40:17,741 --> 01:40:19,150
alligators.
Don't we give it a run?

2139
01:40:19,210 --> 01:40:21,040
Yeah.
He gives all these people worried about,

2140
01:40:21,070 --> 01:40:25,030
you know,
like a large scale consuming of beef and

2141
01:40:25,031 --> 01:40:28,120
the harm on the environment.
We got to kill these goddamn alligators,

2142
01:40:28,300 --> 01:40:29,860
so why don't we just start fucking eaten
them,

2143
01:40:30,070 --> 01:40:31,900
eh,
grow alligator farms and kill these

2144
01:40:31,901 --> 01:40:36,370
fuckers and you'll lose weight because
you're eating pure protein.

2145
01:40:36,940 --> 01:40:38,090
Right.
So you're right.

2146
01:40:38,110 --> 01:40:39,610
I don't know,
does it probably,

2147
01:40:39,850 --> 01:40:42,310
you probably get all ramped up.
I bet if you eat that stuff,

2148
01:40:42,311 --> 01:40:44,740
it's probably a soup.
Primal for Eaton,

2149
01:40:44,741 --> 01:40:46,600
an alligator.
Your Dick probably gets hard as a rock.

2150
01:40:51,490 --> 01:40:53,380
I mean,
have you ever thought that?

2151
01:40:53,560 --> 01:40:54,393
No,

2152
01:40:55,040 --> 01:40:57,100
it's got to happen.
That only make sense.

2153
01:40:58,420 --> 01:41:00,910
Like why else would do eat like mountain
lions?

2154
01:41:00,940 --> 01:41:03,200
Do you know people eat mountain lions?
The,

2155
01:41:03,201 --> 01:41:05,620
yeah,
the Loin,

2156
01:41:05,650 --> 01:41:09,640
the muscles in the back straps,
the muscles that are on the outside of

2157
01:41:09,641 --> 01:41:12,870
the spine.
That's where like the tenderloin is on a

2158
01:41:12,880 --> 01:41:15,940
beef cow,
like inside connected to the spine.

2159
01:41:16,300 --> 01:41:20,170
That's the same that does the same meat.
They like to get off of mountain lions,

2160
01:41:20,650 --> 01:41:25,000
but I mean why would anybody eat that
unless you were a really hungry or be,

2161
01:41:25,001 --> 01:41:30,001
it makes your tent cards crowbar.
Just imagine if we all found out there's

2162
01:41:31,721 --> 01:41:35,320
like a type of food.
It just makes you rock hard and they're

2163
01:41:35,321 --> 01:41:38,680
trying to give you pills were actually,
here's the answer and she needed

2164
01:41:38,681 --> 01:41:42,220
mountain lions need to study math,
crocodiles and shit.

2165
01:41:44,710 --> 01:41:47,080
I think,
I just think we're just so disconnected

2166
01:41:47,290 --> 01:41:51,400
from these animals that we have like
some sort of a weird fairytale idea what

2167
01:41:51,401 --> 01:41:55,570
these things are just wandering around
Disneyland like they should have guys

2168
01:41:55,810 --> 01:41:57,850
that they hire to go kill these fucking
things.

2169
01:41:58,090 --> 01:41:59,500
Like,
why are you letting these things live?

2170
01:41:59,890 --> 01:42:02,650
Because we're out of your mind.
There's too many of them.

2171
01:42:02,651 --> 01:42:04,540
They're going to keep breeding.
They eat everything.

2172
01:42:04,541 --> 01:42:06,580
They eat.
Dogs and cats and children.

2173
01:42:06,820 --> 01:42:08,020
The gators.
Yeah.

2174
01:42:08,230 --> 01:42:11,440
They're going to fucking keep eating
things like you guys and this idea that

2175
01:42:11,441 --> 01:42:14,380
all life is sacred.
Your life is fucking sacred.

2176
01:42:14,381 --> 01:42:16,300
Stupid.
They're going to eat you.

2177
01:42:16,450 --> 01:42:18,190
They're gonna eat you.
Why wouldn't he damn.

2178
01:42:18,820 --> 01:42:19,780
Well,
they're going to eat you.

2179
01:42:20,040 --> 01:42:21,730
They're definitely going to eat you to
eat you.

2180
01:42:21,790 --> 01:42:24,070
If you don't eat them,
then they're going to be so many of them

2181
01:42:24,071 --> 01:42:25,420
that they're definitely gonna eat you.

2182
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:29,920
Yeah.
Keep simple wildlife biologist strategy.

2183
01:42:29,921 --> 01:42:33,760
Do I have just kill everything mallee or
stand there?

2184
01:42:34,030 --> 01:42:36,580
They help the environment.
They do that.

2185
01:42:36,700 --> 01:42:39,340
That's one thing about coyotes,
like everybody hates the coyotes out

2186
01:42:39,341 --> 01:42:41,620
here.
You know how many rats we would have?

2187
01:42:41,621 --> 01:42:43,450
It wasn't for these fucking cards.
What do you,

2188
01:42:43,451 --> 01:42:45,900
what would you rather have?
Would you rather,

2189
01:42:45,910 --> 01:42:46,990
I think cody's,
we're cool.

2190
01:42:47,440 --> 01:42:49,120
Of course.
When I lost the chicken and one

2191
01:42:49,121 --> 01:42:51,100
recently,
did you really?

2192
01:42:51,101 --> 01:42:52,210
You got chickens.
Tell me chickens,

2193
01:42:52,220 --> 01:42:54,460
your gut.
I just got five new ones of God.

2194
01:42:54,461 --> 01:42:56,350
Um,
do you just want to any for now for

2195
01:42:56,351 --> 01:42:57,970
eggs,
they're like pets.

2196
01:42:58,360 --> 01:43:02,080
So do you let them walk around the food?
Do they eat fleas and ticks and all

2197
01:43:02,081 --> 01:43:03,220
that?
They had everything.

2198
01:43:03,250 --> 01:43:06,400
They had all kinds of bugs there.
They're a little dinosaurs man.

2199
01:43:06,610 --> 01:43:08,840
They were really cool but you can pick
them up and,

2200
01:43:10,380 --> 01:43:11,230
but I got the new ones.

2201
01:43:11,230 --> 01:43:13,000
They're a little chicks.
They've actually gotten pretty big

2202
01:43:13,001 --> 01:43:16,420
really quickly.
It's crazy how quick they turn from a

2203
01:43:16,421 --> 01:43:19,540
chicken to like a little chicken.
What happens if you start?

2204
01:43:19,710 --> 01:43:21,480
What do you do with the other chicks?
Like what do you,

2205
01:43:21,490 --> 01:43:23,500
when the glory introduced?
There's my checks.

2206
01:43:23,501 --> 01:43:24,730
There's a,
these are the new ones.

2207
01:43:25,960 --> 01:43:28,690
These are the farm I have,
um,

2208
01:43:28,720 --> 01:43:31,150
a large hen house.
It's really big.

2209
01:43:31,600 --> 01:43:35,560
So they can wander around in there and
they're all protected from the coyotes.

2210
01:43:35,590 --> 01:43:38,710
It's an enormous thing.
But then I also let them out in the

2211
01:43:38,711 --> 01:43:41,080
yard,
but I got to keep him away from my dog.

2212
01:43:41,081 --> 01:43:44,420
He's decided that he can kill them cause
the coyote talked to him.

2213
01:43:44,680 --> 01:43:47,650
Coyote honey dictum.
Yeah.

2214
01:43:47,651 --> 01:43:50,970
The coyote became friends with them and
then talk to them and to go in and break

2215
01:43:51,050 --> 01:43:53,570
into a one of the side coops and kill
him on the chickens.

2216
01:43:53,880 --> 01:43:55,130
So hearsay.
Yeah,

2217
01:43:55,310 --> 01:43:57,830
you have to take chickens.
They brewed sometimes,

2218
01:43:57,831 --> 01:44:00,080
which is they get this thought,
there's no rooster if they're not

2219
01:44:00,081 --> 01:44:01,590
getting fucked all the time.
They,

2220
01:44:01,680 --> 01:44:04,370
the laying these eggs for no reason
cause there's no chickens ever going to

2221
01:44:04,371 --> 01:44:05,870
come out of those eggs and not
fertilized.

2222
01:44:06,320 --> 01:44:08,330
So these eggs are just,
it's just free food.

2223
01:44:08,390 --> 01:44:11,870
It's basically the product of you giving
them food.

2224
01:44:11,871 --> 01:44:13,800
They lay an egg and you eat that egg.
Right.

2225
01:44:13,820 --> 01:44:14,960
It's really interesting.
Right.

2226
01:44:15,320 --> 01:44:17,900
But the hen,
sometimes they get crazy because these

2227
01:44:18,160 --> 01:44:22,040
eggs never become chicks so they think
they're supposed to like sit on the egg

2228
01:44:22,370 --> 01:44:24,770
and it becomes a check.
And so they start pulling their feathers

2229
01:44:24,771 --> 01:44:27,590
off and they do what's called brooding
and it'll take a long cycle.

2230
01:44:27,591 --> 01:44:29,420
It takes like 28 days for them to get
over it.

2231
01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:33,680
Unless you catch them early in the brood
and you separate them from the rest of

2232
01:44:33,681 --> 01:44:35,630
the chickens and you put them in a
stand,

2233
01:44:35,950 --> 01:44:38,060
like were they a,
you put them in a smaller cage where

2234
01:44:38,061 --> 01:44:39,800
they have to stand on a bar.

2235
01:44:40,160 --> 01:44:42,290
And once they do that,
because they're not in a nasty,

2236
01:44:42,291 --> 01:44:44,270
not sitting in a nesting box,
it,

2237
01:44:44,480 --> 01:44:46,100
it goes through the cycle and their
brain,

2238
01:44:46,250 --> 01:44:48,590
they're little simple little reptile
brains.

2239
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:51,560
And then you bring them back into the
chicken coop and they act like a regular

2240
01:44:51,561 --> 01:44:53,600
chicken.
But otherwise they think it's like a

2241
01:44:53,601 --> 01:44:54,680
health problem.
They don't eat.

2242
01:44:54,710 --> 01:44:55,820
They start pulling their,
uh,

2243
01:44:55,821 --> 01:44:56,630
their,
their,

2244
01:44:56,630 --> 01:44:58,610
um,
feathers off of their body.

2245
01:44:58,611 --> 01:45:00,020
It's like,
it gets really weird.

2246
01:45:00,080 --> 01:45:03,290
So I had them separated and uh,
the dog,

2247
01:45:03,500 --> 01:45:06,920
I have a huge dog,
the coyote talk the dog and to knocking

2248
01:45:06,921 --> 01:45:08,300
over the,
uh,

2249
01:45:08,301 --> 01:45:11,270
the chicken coop to get out the chicken,
like the kyle probably wouldn't be able

2250
01:45:11,271 --> 01:45:13,040
to do it on its own because it's not big
enough.

2251
01:45:13,340 --> 01:45:15,860
But my dog is a massive,
and so the,

2252
01:45:16,490 --> 01:45:19,760
there's a coyote,
Kenny Dichter my fucking dumb ass dog.

2253
01:45:21,530 --> 01:45:23,720
That's like,
he came and he's like,

2254
01:45:23,721 --> 01:45:24,890
listen man,
we're buddies.

2255
01:45:24,920 --> 01:45:26,050
Which you're a doll.
You're,

2256
01:45:26,051 --> 01:45:29,300
you're a coyote technically just to
house pet.

2257
01:45:29,330 --> 01:45:30,470
No,
they got fun too.

2258
01:45:30,471 --> 01:45:33,230
They can fuck dogs and coyotes.
Fuck all the time.

2259
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:34,490
Wow.
He duked them.

2260
01:45:34,760 --> 01:45:36,080
Yeah.
They make babies,

2261
01:45:36,081 --> 01:45:36,560
man.
Uh,

2262
01:45:36,560 --> 01:45:39,230
we ran into a,
when I was filming fear factor wants,

2263
01:45:39,231 --> 01:45:42,540
we're filming on this real rural area
and uh,

2264
01:45:42,650 --> 01:45:46,700
these people had a bunch of puppies that
were half coyote and have labrador.

2265
01:45:47,390 --> 01:45:48,410
Huh?
Yeah.

2266
01:45:48,620 --> 01:45:50,540
Coyote came over and fuck their dog,
man,

2267
01:45:51,530 --> 01:45:52,710
that was out here.
Yeah.

2268
01:45:52,740 --> 01:45:56,390
Like a dirty criminal sneaking into yard
and fucking your daughter like,

2269
01:45:56,391 --> 01:45:58,850
oh my goodness.
A little escape convict.

2270
01:45:59,080 --> 01:45:59,913
Right.

2271
01:46:01,360 --> 01:46:04,270
I don't want you hanging out with them.
[inaudible] it was cold out too.

2272
01:46:04,271 --> 01:46:06,250
And these puppies were all huddled up
together and we were like,

2273
01:46:06,251 --> 01:46:09,280
whoa.
Now what happens is now what are you

2274
01:46:09,281 --> 01:46:10,660
guys going to do?
They're trying to give them away and

2275
01:46:10,661 --> 01:46:12,750
there was like,
I don't want to have fuck fucking Eddie.

2276
01:46:12,820 --> 01:46:14,800
Exactly.
What the hell is that kind of eat my

2277
01:46:14,801 --> 01:46:17,590
newborn too.
It's a weird thing because they really

2278
01:46:17,591 --> 01:46:19,030
are all bowls.
Everybody.

2279
01:46:19,031 --> 01:46:21,340
Everything's a wolf.
That's why they can all breed with each

2280
01:46:21,341 --> 01:46:22,660
other.
It's so strange.

2281
01:46:23,230 --> 01:46:24,130
You know,
like a,

2282
01:46:24,131 --> 01:46:29,131
a hippo can't breathe with an elephant,
but a wolf can fuck a Chihuahua and may

2283
01:46:30,661 --> 01:46:33,040
get pregnant.
Zero dogs.

2284
01:46:33,160 --> 01:46:36,640
Yeah,
we're all dogs come from wolves.

2285
01:46:37,720 --> 01:46:39,070
That's so strange.
Like if a,

2286
01:46:39,071 --> 01:46:41,200
if a,
if a wolf could figure out how to fit

2287
01:46:41,201 --> 01:46:45,130
his dick and a Chihuahua and shoot a
load in that Chihuahua,

2288
01:46:45,970 --> 01:46:48,940
the Chihuahua,
it could conceivably have wolf Chihuahua

2289
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:49,500
puppies.

2290
01:46:49,500 --> 01:46:50,850
Yeah.
Fuck.

2291
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:53,850
And what would it look like?
Like that's again,

2292
01:46:54,030 --> 01:46:56,640
like an alien,
like a crazy,

2293
01:46:56,641 --> 01:47:00,900
it looked like big foot tude ever seen
those Werewolf mcats?

2294
01:47:01,860 --> 01:47:02,790
Yeah,
they scare me.

2295
01:47:02,820 --> 01:47:05,420
And there's also some weird,
is that a conspiracy you ever see the,

2296
01:47:05,421 --> 01:47:09,030
the weird blue dog thing?
Well what does that Jamie typed in

2297
01:47:09,031 --> 01:47:10,560
shallow wolf breed.
It's called a wolf.

2298
01:47:10,561 --> 01:47:12,590
Sable Watts?
Yeah.

2299
01:47:13,260 --> 01:47:15,480
Is that,
is it a hybrid or it's the AKC

2300
01:47:15,481 --> 01:47:16,800
registered breed.
Oh,

2301
01:47:16,801 --> 01:47:19,140
whoa.
A little tiny Wolf Chihuahua.

2302
01:47:20,400 --> 01:47:21,420
I'm sorry.
What'd you ask him?

2303
01:47:21,690 --> 01:47:26,690
I don't even remember
you asked if I'd seen something.

2304
01:47:26,850 --> 01:47:28,850
It was some weird blue,
uh,

2305
01:47:29,490 --> 01:47:33,450
like blue eyed dog looking thing.
Do you know what I'm talking about?

2306
01:47:34,210 --> 01:47:35,370
No,
it hasn't attacked.

2307
01:47:35,371 --> 01:47:37,560
It was just,
it looks weird and creepy and they got a

2308
01:47:37,561 --> 01:47:39,660
video of it running along a fence or
something.

2309
01:47:40,320 --> 01:47:40,771
Oh,
Chub.

2310
01:47:40,771 --> 01:47:41,561
Macabre.
Yeah,

2311
01:47:41,561 --> 01:47:42,031
yeah,
yeah,

2312
01:47:42,031 --> 01:47:42,420
yeah.

2313
01:47:42,420 --> 01:47:43,670
You know what they think that is?
What is it?

2314
01:47:43,730 --> 01:47:46,530
I think it's a coyote with mange.
They think that,

2315
01:47:46,531 --> 01:47:49,020
uh,
when coyote is get mange right and it's

2316
01:47:49,021 --> 01:47:52,710
real common with animals.
They get it's Mites and the Mites.

2317
01:47:52,711 --> 01:47:53,790
That's like the,
they get,

2318
01:47:53,791 --> 01:47:56,820
they developed this horrible skin
disease and they lose all their hair and

2319
01:47:56,821 --> 01:48:01,050
their skin becomes black and fucked up
and it gets burnt by the sun.

2320
01:48:01,090 --> 01:48:03,030
Looks Awful.
It just looks awful.

2321
01:48:03,270 --> 01:48:05,130
And yeah,
they look like that.

2322
01:48:05,340 --> 01:48:07,060
So that's a Chub Macabre.
Yeah.

2323
01:48:07,170 --> 01:48:09,960
What it is is a,
it's a coyote then that doesn't have any

2324
01:48:09,961 --> 01:48:10,980
hair.
Yeah.

2325
01:48:12,330 --> 01:48:14,940
And uh,
I think there's quite a few animals.

2326
01:48:14,941 --> 01:48:17,100
Like if you go download that photo there
right there,

2327
01:48:17,101 --> 01:48:18,930
look at that thing.
Oh yeah.

2328
01:48:18,960 --> 01:48:22,080
I mean there's quite a,
I mean it's probably in constant pain,

2329
01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:25,260
you know,
I mean it's skin is just all fucked up.

2330
01:48:25,500 --> 01:48:28,500
A lot of times there's like open sores
all over their body.

2331
01:48:29,090 --> 01:48:33,660
There's a dog or a wolf,
wolf bear rather that has manged to

2332
01:48:33,930 --> 01:48:35,400
chimps.
Get it sometimes too.

2333
01:48:35,550 --> 01:48:37,110
Right.
They have ever seen those hairless

2334
01:48:37,111 --> 01:48:37,950
chimps.
Yeah.

2335
01:48:38,410 --> 01:48:40,020
A lot of times that's what's going on
with them too.

2336
01:48:40,021 --> 01:48:42,480
They've got mange.
I had a dog that had management,

2337
01:48:43,880 --> 01:48:46,650
I rescued her,
she had mange and um,

2338
01:48:46,890 --> 01:48:50,210
they gave me this like ointment to get,
but once I started feeding our good food

2339
01:48:50,211 --> 01:48:51,990
at her hair all came back like real
quick,

2340
01:48:52,040 --> 01:48:54,870
just washed her with some certain type
of shampoo.

2341
01:48:54,871 --> 01:48:57,930
And then within like a couple months,
like all the mains was gone,

2342
01:48:57,931 --> 01:48:59,850
her hair was all big and fluffy and
healthy.

2343
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:01,430
Oh yeah.
Mangers.

2344
01:49:01,470 --> 01:49:03,510
Uh,
but that's what the Katuba copper is

2345
01:49:03,610 --> 01:49:07,630
just kind of mange.
It looks I started like a year ago in or

2346
01:49:07,650 --> 01:49:09,270
what it was going on.
If you saw that man,

2347
01:49:09,271 --> 01:49:11,040
if you saw something like that,
I don't sign person,

2348
01:49:11,041 --> 01:49:12,570
but if I saw something that freak out.

2349
01:49:12,690 --> 01:49:14,400
Yeah.
You think it is a market spinsters

2350
01:49:14,401 --> 01:49:15,430
aliens.
Yeah.

2351
01:49:15,480 --> 01:49:18,060
That's why the Mexicans believe in the
troop of Cobra.

2352
01:49:18,120 --> 01:49:19,680
That's what it is.
That's there.

2353
01:49:19,710 --> 01:49:24,360
But they can see that where big foot
though because the coyotes will fucking

2354
01:49:24,361 --> 01:49:25,980
kill your chickens and shit.
You know?

2355
01:49:26,220 --> 01:49:28,680
And that's probably the he kill a kid.
Oh yeah,

2356
01:49:28,710 --> 01:49:29,580
absolutely.
Right.

2357
01:49:29,850 --> 01:49:30,683
Definitely.
They,

2358
01:49:30,900 --> 01:49:33,690
they killed this girl in Toronto a few
years back.

2359
01:49:33,990 --> 01:49:37,650
It was a 19 year old singer from when
she should a country music singer.

2360
01:49:38,070 --> 01:49:43,070
It was really promising young artists in
Toronto and she's going for a walk and

2361
01:49:43,461 --> 01:49:46,080
they killed her in the forest.
Yeah,

2362
01:49:46,110 --> 01:49:48,700
during the day.
That's a bad way to die too,

2363
01:49:48,701 --> 01:49:49,510
man.
Oh,

2364
01:49:49,510 --> 01:49:52,210
because they you asshole first.
That's right.

2365
01:49:52,420 --> 01:49:53,740
That's what they do.
They tear you apart,

2366
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,860
it tear you apart.
And if for some reason coyotes,

2367
01:49:56,890 --> 01:49:58,450
they,
when they kill a deer,

2368
01:49:58,720 --> 01:50:01,300
and I'm assuming they do the same thing
when they kill a human being,

2369
01:50:01,301 --> 01:50:02,490
they start with your asshole.

2370
01:50:03,840 --> 01:50:05,570
And I'm sure that they tried to
suffocate.

2371
01:50:06,400 --> 01:50:07,390
Um,
I don't know,

2372
01:50:07,391 --> 01:50:08,224
man.
I don't know.

2373
01:50:08,530 --> 01:50:11,080
They just started tearing it.
They might just start ripping you apart

2374
01:50:11,220 --> 01:50:12,580
if,
especially if they felt like it could

2375
01:50:12,581 --> 01:50:15,190
hold you down because wolves do that to
animals all the time.

2376
01:50:15,191 --> 01:50:18,820
They just chew what their legs bring
them down and then you start pulling

2377
01:50:18,821 --> 01:50:21,940
them apart while they're still alive.
Yeah.

2378
01:50:21,941 --> 01:50:26,290
My buddy found a moose that was getting
attacked by wolves and they found it,

2379
01:50:26,480 --> 01:50:28,840
uh,
and it looked like it had been getting

2380
01:50:28,841 --> 01:50:32,350
chewed on for over a day and it was
still alive.

2381
01:50:32,670 --> 01:50:35,230
This is,
Moose was all fucked up and half of its

2382
01:50:35,231 --> 01:50:37,210
hindquarters were chewed off.
And these wolves,

2383
01:50:37,211 --> 01:50:40,900
we're just pulling it apart slowly.
And they had been eating it for a day.

2384
01:50:41,170 --> 01:50:43,000
Oh yeah.
It's still alive.

2385
01:50:43,660 --> 01:50:44,870
Brutal.
Yeah.

2386
01:50:46,130 --> 01:50:48,340
Again,
like a settler just going around and

2387
01:50:48,940 --> 01:50:49,870
goes,
your brother,

2388
01:50:49,980 --> 01:50:50,920
your brother,
just get to,

2389
01:50:50,921 --> 01:50:51,790
you watch it,
brothers.

2390
01:50:51,790 --> 01:50:53,370
You get torn up.
Yeah.

2391
01:50:53,430 --> 01:50:55,990
And they're reintroducing those.
That's as even more interesting.

2392
01:50:56,020 --> 01:50:58,600
They're bringing them back to all these
different parts of the West.

2393
01:50:58,750 --> 01:51:01,570
And if you can get to those people that
poisoned them back in the 18 hundreds if

2394
01:51:01,571 --> 01:51:03,340
you can get them bring to the future,
that's like,

2395
01:51:03,341 --> 01:51:03,581
well,
blah,

2396
01:51:03,581 --> 01:51:03,821
blah,
blah,

2397
01:51:03,821 --> 01:51:04,121
blah,
blah.

2398
01:51:04,121 --> 01:51:07,300
You brought them here.
You know we used to kill these fucking

2399
01:51:07,301 --> 01:51:10,390
things.
You guys brought them here this way they

2400
01:51:10,391 --> 01:51:14,290
have to stay in the areas outside of old
hip places.

2401
01:51:14,470 --> 01:51:16,300
They can't go hiking.
Sa,

2402
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:17,320
Juna,
Stan,

2403
01:51:17,490 --> 01:51:19,690
the snow ed escape.
If they go swimming,

2404
01:51:19,870 --> 01:51:24,060
we have to crocodiles for the smile.
That genius,

2405
01:51:24,900 --> 01:51:27,790
they've must find.
Nothing means of entertainment.

2406
01:51:27,880 --> 01:51:31,560
That's well we call him inside.
I'm television.

2407
01:51:33,380 --> 01:51:36,280
I don't want to steal.
Hiking is too dangerous.

2408
01:51:36,510 --> 01:51:39,370
Hey Dan,
you got fast black bears now,

2409
01:51:39,371 --> 01:51:41,280
which we used to trust them.

2410
01:51:41,280 --> 01:51:44,260
It's just the idea just big up and how
they eat.

2411
01:51:44,261 --> 01:51:45,750
People Sat,
Sat,

2412
01:51:45,850 --> 01:51:48,970
nature's the great educator.
You go out there in nature of balances

2413
01:51:48,971 --> 01:51:53,470
you out to put things back into
respective and we simply can't have that

2414
01:51:54,670 --> 01:51:59,140
need them stupid and electronically
connected and we need to grab all these

2415
01:51:59,141 --> 01:52:04,141
tummy starts doing this and start new
societies and why won't they lent Damn

2416
01:52:05,530 --> 01:52:08,050
Pipe Poland?
Why won't they sit down in this dinner

2417
01:52:08,170 --> 01:52:13,170
when I talk about Ponce De Leon,
Dr

2418
01:52:21,200 --> 01:52:23,200
Dodge,
after times of God,

2419
01:52:25,060 --> 01:52:27,820
you know,
it always kills me like straight edge

2420
01:52:27,821 --> 01:52:30,670
guys like guys who don't smoke,
they don't drink,

2421
01:52:30,880 --> 01:52:34,270
but their intellect,
super hardcore music,

2422
01:52:34,450 --> 01:52:37,990
whether they're all like strat around
and they throw their arms up in the air,

2423
01:52:37,991 --> 01:52:42,790
like the fucking wreck it Ralph Ralph
dance.

2424
01:52:43,150 --> 01:52:46,250
I just went to a,
and

2425
01:52:46,250 --> 01:52:48,020
uh,
it was in Jersey and I,

2426
01:52:49,280 --> 01:52:52,910
I'm fascinated how I'm not really
fascinating.

2427
01:52:52,960 --> 01:52:57,620
It's just,
it's tribal watching grown men still go

2428
01:52:57,621 --> 01:53:00,920
around slam as hard as they can into
each other.

2429
01:53:01,250 --> 01:53:05,030
Just just vent shirts coming off when it
shouldn't come off someone's guys like

2430
01:53:05,031 --> 01:53:09,590
in their forties they don't care that
this is the first time I drank in three

2431
01:53:09,591 --> 01:53:13,850
months and there and just smashing into
each other,

2432
01:53:14,150 --> 01:53:16,070
hurting each other.
It's nuts.

2433
01:53:16,130 --> 01:53:19,210
Yeah.
Eliding yeah.

2434
01:53:19,670 --> 01:53:21,830
Old Indians used to do that.
Did they?

2435
01:53:22,070 --> 01:53:24,290
I think so.
The sets of the show in the movies,

2436
01:53:24,620 --> 01:53:27,680
I wonder how much of that stuff's real.
How much is that?

2437
01:53:27,681 --> 01:53:29,180
Yeah,
they really did.

2438
01:53:29,360 --> 01:53:31,880
I don't know if they've ran around.
I don't know.

2439
01:53:32,010 --> 01:53:33,920
It's a good question.
I was not there.

2440
01:53:34,770 --> 01:53:37,640
Hmm.
And who was really there if you had the

2441
01:53:37,641 --> 01:53:40,820
opportunity to go and view any culture
from the past?

2442
01:53:40,821 --> 01:53:43,790
Like if you could be completely
invisible and walk around amongst the

2443
01:53:43,791 --> 01:53:48,791
Romans or cave people or native
Americans before the Europeans came,

2444
01:53:49,250 --> 01:53:50,600
what would you choose?
Wow,

2445
01:53:50,601 --> 01:53:52,370
that's really hard question.
Yeah.

2446
01:53:56,240 --> 01:53:57,830
Um,
I think,

2447
01:53:59,600 --> 01:54:04,600
I don't know when the time would be,
but the first time where anything was

2448
01:54:05,001 --> 01:54:09,290
trying to be colonized,
like changed from being what your

2449
01:54:09,291 --> 01:54:13,400
regular like the first time like a boat
showed up in Polynesia or something like

2450
01:54:13,401 --> 01:54:14,930
that and some white people got out.
Right.

2451
01:54:14,931 --> 01:54:17,300
We're used to being in the fields every
day and,

2452
01:54:17,301 --> 01:54:21,500
and you know,
this guy hunts and this guy watches

2453
01:54:21,501 --> 01:54:25,760
after the boys and teaches them and this
one zoe and we're all,

2454
01:54:25,761 --> 01:54:28,670
you know,
and then all of a sudden they come up

2455
01:54:28,671 --> 01:54:29,650
and they're building like you guys

2456
01:54:29,750 --> 01:54:33,810
native is why you live in,
he calls for color.

2457
01:54:33,870 --> 01:54:38,210
Cocks are
the women are staring at their fucking

2458
01:54:38,211 --> 01:54:40,550
balls two feet from the ground.
What are these things?

2459
01:54:40,551 --> 01:54:42,260
And they might,
what the fuck is going on?

2460
01:54:42,800 --> 01:54:47,800
Jesus Christ cannot fleas.
Guys got a fucking look at his hair.

2461
01:54:47,841 --> 01:54:51,920
It's chunked off his fucking Tito.
He's got bones in his fucking here.

2462
01:54:52,580 --> 01:54:54,890
Rice.
Can I get a Bible

2463
01:54:56,690 --> 01:55:00,560
lesson
and there was this thing called Noah's

2464
01:55:00,561 --> 01:55:01,460
Ark.
Sit down.

2465
01:55:01,461 --> 01:55:03,020
He's fuckers.
Don't pay attention.

2466
01:55:03,470 --> 01:55:06,140
Get you fucking round them up.
Call Dobby and the boys.

2467
01:55:06,141 --> 01:55:07,940
We're going to need about 40 these
fucking things.

2468
01:55:07,941 --> 01:55:09,890
Climb trees.
What is your character's name?

2469
01:55:09,891 --> 01:55:12,170
I love the guy who used to come back
more often.

2470
01:55:12,810 --> 01:55:17,480
This is Joe.
They climb trees.

2471
01:55:17,810 --> 01:55:19,520
What do you mean that they fucking,
they don't even,

2472
01:55:19,521 --> 01:55:24,521
they don't even with our hands and her
at age of fucking car and he's up there

2473
01:55:24,621 --> 01:55:26,650
for 20 minutes.
Eat a Gundam.

2474
01:55:26,690 --> 01:55:28,150
Leon.
The fuck is going on.

2475
01:55:28,190 --> 01:55:30,110
I'm getting eaten by ants.
He's laughing.

2476
01:55:31,570 --> 01:55:32,770
Yeah.
Yeah.

2477
01:55:33,160 --> 01:55:34,000
Sorry.
No,

2478
01:55:34,001 --> 01:55:35,710
that's a,
that's a good thought.

2479
01:55:35,950 --> 01:55:37,810
Like the,
that might be like one of the most

2480
01:55:37,811 --> 01:55:39,040
important times ever.
Right.

2481
01:55:39,250 --> 01:55:43,320
When the people came from Spain and
landed in the West indies,

2482
01:55:43,410 --> 01:55:44,010
when,
when

2483
01:55:44,010 --> 01:55:46,800
Columbus and the Pinta,
that was where we landed,

2484
01:55:46,801 --> 01:55:49,920
right?
The West indies and they encountered the

2485
01:55:49,921 --> 01:55:53,700
people that were living there.
The native people that I think that I

2486
01:55:53,701 --> 01:55:56,640
would choose that I choose that it's
like the first,

2487
01:55:56,641 --> 01:56:00,600
the thing that you could see like to
know that this is this experience right

2488
01:56:00,601 --> 01:56:04,290
now is going to fucking change the
future of the world and I want to know

2489
01:56:04,291 --> 01:56:07,650
the why,
why we wanted spices and shit.

2490
01:56:08,010 --> 01:56:10,200
It was what they wanted.
They wanted gold and salt.

2491
01:56:11,370 --> 01:56:13,740
So again,
why like what was so why like all right,

2492
01:56:13,741 --> 01:56:16,500
listen,
we need to train them to be like us or

2493
01:56:16,501 --> 01:56:17,160
like we don't,
I don't,

2494
01:56:17,160 --> 01:56:18,330
I,
that's the part I go,

2495
01:56:18,331 --> 01:56:21,380
what?
How did we get from it?

2496
01:56:21,510 --> 01:56:23,400
It's,
it doesn't happen overnight where you

2497
01:56:23,490 --> 01:56:26,820
wear your running after something with a
stick or you just eat any farming than

2498
01:56:26,821 --> 01:56:28,470
wall somewhere in a classroom.

2499
01:56:28,610 --> 01:56:31,020
Yeah.
We have to work to make Wayne it give

2500
01:56:31,021 --> 01:56:35,100
this guy fucking something.
Is it again?

2501
01:56:35,101 --> 01:56:39,480
Like the fittest one tribe is now
starving and now I don't know.

2502
01:56:39,860 --> 01:56:43,230
I think will see the other one.
They wanted to expand their territory's.

2503
01:56:43,290 --> 01:56:45,030
I mean it's like game of thrones type
shit.

2504
01:56:45,420 --> 01:56:49,920
The king wants to bring back more gold.
And so he commissioned a fleet and he

2505
01:56:49,921 --> 01:56:53,610
hires a captain and he promises that
captain riches beyond his wildest

2506
01:56:53,611 --> 01:56:55,950
imagination.
If you go to these foreign lands,

2507
01:56:56,220 --> 01:56:58,890
bring back salt.
And so these fucking people would get in

2508
01:56:58,891 --> 01:57:03,891
these wooden crafts that barely had
enough food for them to survive and make

2509
01:57:04,561 --> 01:57:07,110
it across that goofy ass ocean where
they,

2510
01:57:07,350 --> 01:57:09,870
who knows?
There's no weather report.

2511
01:57:10,110 --> 01:57:13,350
There was no iphone APP that I have no
idea what the fuck was coming.

2512
01:57:13,530 --> 01:57:16,260
And they were in a boat in the ocean and
there's a lot of them didn't make it

2513
01:57:16,560 --> 01:57:21,240
like probably like a good percentage,
like a healthy 10 to 15% never fucking

2514
01:57:21,241 --> 01:57:21,870
made it.

2515
01:57:21,870 --> 01:57:23,550
I bet you more.
I wonder.

2516
01:57:24,470 --> 01:57:27,720
There's a lot of shipwrecks though.
People find them all the time and they

2517
01:57:27,721 --> 01:57:29,940
find him filled with gold.
That's it's crazy,

2518
01:57:29,941 --> 01:57:31,980
man.
They found a ton of them where people

2519
01:57:31,981 --> 01:57:36,240
have gotten super fucking rich where
they found like Roman coins are men and

2520
01:57:36,241 --> 01:57:40,080
a gold worth $1 billion or something
like that off the coast of this place or

2521
01:57:40,380 --> 01:57:43,120
that place.
The power of grade.

2522
01:57:44,670 --> 01:57:46,040
Yeah.
They brought back too much gold and

2523
01:57:46,041 --> 01:57:47,660
they're fucking raft saying,
think of that.

2524
01:57:47,760 --> 01:57:51,780
How desperate are you to go?
Okay,

2525
01:57:52,030 --> 01:57:53,880
we're running out of places to find
gold.

2526
01:57:54,390 --> 01:57:55,890
Let's just,
let's just fucking,

2527
01:57:55,891 --> 01:57:58,020
but I've heard people who've died who
gives a fuck,

2528
01:57:58,021 --> 01:58:00,300
what are we going to do?
He's be headed fucking people,

2529
01:58:00,940 --> 01:58:03,120
but kind of get them gold.
Like how desperate,

2530
01:58:03,121 --> 01:58:05,760
like when,
how desperate you got to be to go,

2531
01:58:06,150 --> 01:58:08,280
we're going to go,
we're going to start hitting other

2532
01:58:08,281 --> 01:58:11,340
countries and fucking fight and Hindu,
whatever we got to do.

2533
01:58:11,550 --> 01:58:15,720
Think about how terrifying it must be to
have a boat filled with gold and you're

2534
01:58:15,721 --> 01:58:19,890
trying to bring it back to Spain and you
realize you brought too much gold and

2535
01:58:19,891 --> 01:58:22,890
the boat starts going under and you're
in the middle of the ocean,

2536
01:58:22,891 --> 01:58:26,220
but you can't throw the gold overboard.
There's discussions saw,

2537
01:58:26,250 --> 01:58:30,450
we've got to get rid of some of this
gold and you're looking out and it's

2538
01:58:30,451 --> 01:58:31,350
dark out,
right?

2539
01:58:31,351 --> 01:58:36,090
It's just the blackening of sea and the
water is slowly leaking into the panels

2540
01:58:36,091 --> 01:58:38,850
in the fucking,
in the galley at the bottom of the boat.

2541
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:42,100
We can't keep taking this on.
We've got

2542
01:58:42,100 --> 01:58:45,610
to get rid of this fucking gold and they
have a sword fight and there and they

2543
01:58:45,611 --> 01:58:49,450
duke it out and they all wind up dead.
All chopped up and bleeding in the

2544
01:58:49,451 --> 01:58:51,580
fucking boat just sinks to the bottom
because they had,

2545
01:58:51,700 --> 01:58:54,370
they couldn't make a decision whether or
not they should throw the gold

2546
01:58:54,371 --> 01:58:58,080
overboard.
I pawned it

2547
01:58:59,950 --> 01:59:02,410
even today,
you could drop a gps pin,

2548
01:59:02,411 --> 01:59:03,610
but what are,
what are the guarantees?

2549
01:59:03,611 --> 01:59:06,310
You could go back to that location and
retrieve it.

2550
01:59:06,490 --> 01:59:10,300
What if you dropped it at the bottom of
the Marianas trench and it's a mile and

2551
01:59:10,300 --> 01:59:11,133
a half down?

2552
01:59:13,100 --> 01:59:14,350
It's gone.
Good luck.

2553
01:59:14,410 --> 01:59:15,700
Good luck fishing it out.
You've got to,

2554
01:59:15,850 --> 01:59:16,271
oh,
it's cool,

2555
01:59:16,271 --> 01:59:17,260
dude.
We got a treble hook.

2556
01:59:17,261 --> 01:59:20,170
My Dad's kind of like a deep sea salt
water set up.

2557
01:59:21,110 --> 01:59:26,110
I couldn't fix it.
My Dad's got the ultimate set of tools

2558
01:59:26,540 --> 01:59:30,330
to the fishing pole and we're going to
die.

2559
01:59:30,410 --> 01:59:33,340
If I hold my breath like a champ,
I'm just going to get under that water

2560
01:59:33,341 --> 01:59:37,090
and bring up one coin at a time.
Oh,

2561
01:59:37,091 --> 01:59:41,260
like they died because they were greedy.
They died because their boats sank with

2562
01:59:41,261 --> 01:59:43,090
too much gold.
Fuck man,

2563
01:59:43,420 --> 01:59:46,810
that's crazy.
Or maybe the boat just sank and it just

2564
01:59:46,811 --> 01:59:49,390
so happens and a lot of gold on board
and a lot of times they made it with

2565
01:59:49,391 --> 01:59:50,770
that much coal on board.
Right?

2566
01:59:51,280 --> 01:59:53,860
Yeah.
But there weren't any fucking engineers

2567
01:59:53,861 --> 01:59:57,880
that had done stress tests on the
exactly.

2568
01:59:57,881 --> 01:59:58,880
How much water to go.

2569
01:59:59,830 --> 02:00:01,510
Oh,
and under pressure.

2570
02:00:01,780 --> 02:00:03,640
We,
we live in such easy times.

2571
02:00:04,120 --> 02:00:06,100
Just carry credit card.
That's right.

2572
02:00:07,480 --> 02:00:10,120
But I liked that whole concept at the
animals are coming back.

2573
02:00:10,420 --> 02:00:11,500
They're coming back,
dude.

2574
02:00:11,950 --> 02:00:14,650
I mean it is what it is.
If you look at Florida,

2575
02:00:14,900 --> 02:00:16,000
you were like,
again,

2576
02:00:16,090 --> 02:00:19,900
I was talking about living there in 1977
we're talking about a very short period

2577
02:00:19,901 --> 02:00:22,570
of time between now and then.
It's just not that long.

2578
02:00:23,140 --> 02:00:24,490
This is not,
it's just not,

2579
02:00:24,880 --> 02:00:29,860
no 40 years is not long at all.
When you talking about biology to short

2580
02:00:29,861 --> 02:00:34,240
amount of time for a radical change like
that for an animal to go from endangered

2581
02:00:34,241 --> 02:00:37,840
to ultra prevalent and eating people on
a regular basis.

2582
02:00:38,650 --> 02:00:40,390
Think,
think of even this,

2583
02:00:40,480 --> 02:00:42,310
the girl that was,
um,

2584
02:00:42,880 --> 02:00:45,010
I guess she's an African,
all that,

2585
02:00:45,790 --> 02:00:48,370
but I don't know if that just kept it
quiet or secret or whatever.

2586
02:00:48,850 --> 02:00:50,680
And maybe it's happened many times in
the past,

2587
02:00:50,681 --> 02:00:53,740
but this one particular time the chick
is in the front seat,

2588
02:00:54,230 --> 02:00:58,270
she's taking pictures and their windows
down and the lion just,

2589
02:00:59,100 --> 02:01:01,780
just,
lily would have grabbed her and pulled

2590
02:01:01,781 --> 02:01:03,800
her out.
It was just killed in front of everybody

2591
02:01:03,820 --> 02:01:05,740
had done that was the game of thrones
editor

2592
02:01:07,270 --> 02:01:08,620
for real.
Yeah.

2593
02:01:08,621 --> 02:01:10,180
She was an editor.
Oh,

2594
02:01:10,181 --> 02:01:12,250
my game of thrones.
Yeah.

2595
02:01:13,670 --> 02:01:15,940
Apparently they told her not to roll the
window down to,

2596
02:01:16,440 --> 02:01:17,860
you know,
I guess it's just so tempting.

2597
02:01:17,861 --> 02:01:20,740
You feel safe.
You're in that car with the lions saw

2598
02:01:20,741 --> 02:01:22,810
that opening and there's a female lion
too.

2599
02:01:23,250 --> 02:01:24,610
There's a lot of pleasure.
Think about that.

2600
02:01:24,611 --> 02:01:27,100
Those lines,
they tell you when you go over there.

2601
02:01:27,610 --> 02:01:28,840
Oh yeah.
They tell you,

2602
02:01:28,841 --> 02:01:29,800
um,
listen,

2603
02:01:30,340 --> 02:01:33,810
they think it's just a big animal so
they're not really gonna.

2604
02:01:33,870 --> 02:01:37,240
He's just got to stay still and don't
move.

2605
02:01:37,270 --> 02:01:39,010
Don't make any checking what?
Uh,

2606
02:01:39,410 --> 02:01:41,330
and he'll think that it's,
uh,

2607
02:01:41,990 --> 02:01:44,750
a big animal.
And so that's your sales pitch.

2608
02:01:44,751 --> 02:01:49,751
You're sitting there in the open and uh,
the lines looking at you going,

2609
02:01:50,590 --> 02:01:52,910
he's just thinks he's not going to jump.
He,

2610
02:01:52,940 --> 02:01:55,520
they told me they,
they would have told me if people have

2611
02:01:55,521 --> 02:01:56,510
been eating before,
right.

2612
02:01:56,900 --> 02:01:59,030
I would want to be in the back of that
helicopter.

2613
02:01:59,270 --> 02:02:02,090
Like that scene in Predator,
we're Jesse Ventura has got the gun

2614
02:02:02,091 --> 02:02:03,770
loaded.
He's calling everybody a bunch of slack.

2615
02:02:03,771 --> 02:02:06,130
Jawed faggots.
I would want,

2616
02:02:06,650 --> 02:02:09,890
that's the only way I would want to go.
I'm going to go with a bunch of dudes

2617
02:02:09,891 --> 02:02:14,330
with fucking bandoliers filled with
bullets and locked and loaded with giant

2618
02:02:14,331 --> 02:02:16,790
steroid filled muscles.
Just read it out

2619
02:02:20,690 --> 02:02:22,820
and never runs out of ammunition either.
Yeah.

2620
02:02:22,821 --> 02:02:24,980
I don't need a camera.
I'll put a Gopro in my head will capture

2621
02:02:24,981 --> 02:02:25,400
the whole thing.

2622
02:02:25,400 --> 02:02:26,600
It's sorted out.
The pictures later,

2623
02:02:27,410 --> 02:02:29,360
he says,
let's just get through this.

2624
02:02:29,810 --> 02:02:32,810
Let's just get through this.
I'm not opening up the fucking window.

2625
02:02:32,840 --> 02:02:34,460
No,
I'm not opening up the fucking window to

2626
02:02:34,461 --> 02:02:38,450
take a picture of a giant cat.
It kills things every day with its face.

2627
02:02:38,480 --> 02:02:40,760
No,
keep the fucking with Deloris.

2628
02:02:40,910 --> 02:02:45,910
Keep the window rolled up.
You crazy bitch and you see that Paul,

2629
02:02:46,941 --> 02:02:51,080
it looks like a catcher's Mitt
with fangs.

2630
02:02:51,180 --> 02:02:54,290
Just clamp,
gets a hold of your tit and just yanks

2631
02:02:54,291 --> 02:02:57,050
you out of the car,
digs into your rib cage.

2632
02:02:57,140 --> 02:02:59,060
God even imagined.
It's horrifying.

2633
02:02:59,300 --> 02:03:02,660
You sitting there with you fucking mets
shirt on and listen to some good music

2634
02:03:02,661 --> 02:03:07,520
on your ipod and it just pause through
that window and digs those closet deep

2635
02:03:07,521 --> 02:03:11,840
into the fucking bones in your ribs and
carries you off like,

2636
02:03:11,990 --> 02:03:15,290
like when you pick up a little pieces of
Shashimi where the chopstick,

2637
02:03:15,470 --> 02:03:17,420
right?
It's that simple.

2638
02:03:17,720 --> 02:03:18,553
Yeah.

2639
02:03:20,180 --> 02:03:24,020
Does even you come right out of that
window in a second would take you 10

2640
02:03:24,021 --> 02:03:26,360
minutes to climb out of it.
It's why we all need guns.

2641
02:03:28,880 --> 02:03:33,880
The lineups are coming.
Do you think that after shootings

2642
02:03:36,051 --> 02:03:39,770
happen,
the sales in guns go up?

2643
02:03:39,860 --> 02:03:40,671
Oh yeah,
for sure.

2644
02:03:40,671 --> 02:03:41,660
100% guy.
Right?

2645
02:03:41,720 --> 02:03:44,390
People get scared too when all the
rhetoric starts getting around about

2646
02:03:44,450 --> 02:03:46,910
ending the second amendment,
taking away people's rights to guns.

2647
02:03:47,570 --> 02:03:48,920
I mean,
it's the best thing in the world for

2648
02:03:48,921 --> 02:03:50,690
ammunition companies and rifle
companies.

2649
02:03:50,960 --> 02:03:52,790
Jamie,
there's a video that people are throwing

2650
02:03:52,791 --> 02:03:54,950
around on instagram.
I don't know.

2651
02:03:54,951 --> 02:03:56,360
I wanted to ask you,
this is true.

2652
02:03:56,630 --> 02:03:58,970
There's a a peep.
Some people from another country,

2653
02:03:58,971 --> 02:04:01,460
they're speaking a foreign language.
They're talking in front of a lion

2654
02:04:01,461 --> 02:04:04,580
carcass and they've got like,
they're taking a photo and then another

2655
02:04:04,581 --> 02:04:06,380
line comes in Jackson off camera.

2656
02:04:06,530 --> 02:04:08,840
Oh Wow.
But it looks so fake.

2657
02:04:09,050 --> 02:04:11,150
Oh yeah.
It looks so convenient.

2658
02:04:11,240 --> 02:04:13,940
Like the fact,
the framing of it where the lion gets

2659
02:04:13,941 --> 02:04:17,380
into frame and then jumps over the
camera to get the persons,

2660
02:04:17,390 --> 02:04:20,150
they scream and you hear the noises in
the background.

2661
02:04:20,600 --> 02:04:21,500
I watched.
I was like,

2662
02:04:21,501 --> 02:04:23,720
man,
this is a way to theatrical.

2663
02:04:23,721 --> 02:04:26,540
It's way too well framed.
This has gotta be bullshit.

2664
02:04:27,500 --> 02:04:30,470
That was my initial instinct,
but was interesting.

2665
02:04:30,590 --> 02:04:31,730
Oh,
King's MMA,

2666
02:04:31,731 --> 02:04:34,460
put it on their instagram page.
My friend,

2667
02:04:34,461 --> 02:04:37,560
a hot fail Codero who's a one of the
best,

2668
02:04:38,190 --> 02:04:40,620
uh,
Moitai instructors in the world trains a

2669
02:04:40,621 --> 02:04:42,660
bunch of world champions for breezy over
doom.

2670
02:04:42,661 --> 02:04:45,210
Hofeld dos Anjos a lot of people.
He's a great guy too.

2671
02:04:45,240 --> 02:04:50,190
He put it on his page and he was uh,
it was funny cause he put a caption in

2672
02:04:50,550 --> 02:04:52,530
Brazil,
the Brazilian version of English,

2673
02:04:52,710 --> 02:04:54,390
you know,
you are in his house now.

2674
02:04:54,391 --> 02:04:56,270
Like that kind of shit like here it is.
Yeah.

2675
02:04:56,280 --> 02:04:58,710
Yeah.
I get this to any line.

2676
02:04:58,870 --> 02:05:00,660
Whoops,
go back.

2677
02:05:00,750 --> 02:05:02,560
Here he is.
Look at the um,

2678
02:05:02,640 --> 02:05:03,420
okay.
His,

2679
02:05:03,420 --> 02:05:08,420
his words are interesting
humans mentality there.

2680
02:05:09,210 --> 02:05:14,210
Think it's a sport to kill lions.
Well I guess the lions brother wasn't

2681
02:05:14,251 --> 02:05:15,590
going for that.
Okay.

2682
02:05:15,840 --> 02:05:17,460
Going up.
But teat Mr Lion,

2683
02:05:17,461 --> 02:05:18,650
we feel your pain.
See,

2684
02:05:21,130 --> 02:05:22,230
looks fake as fuck.
Right?

2685
02:05:23,680 --> 02:05:24,161
Yeah.
Let me,

2686
02:05:24,161 --> 02:05:25,300
here,
let me see her again.

2687
02:05:25,540 --> 02:05:26,590
I can't replay it.
It'll,

2688
02:05:26,600 --> 02:05:29,740
it'll replay itself.
He ran straight to the person who had

2689
02:05:29,741 --> 02:05:32,440
the gun.
This is their house and nobody can cross

2690
02:05:32,441 --> 02:05:34,030
that line.
That's so hilarious.

2691
02:05:35,870 --> 02:05:39,550
See the line comes back into focus.
I don't buy that at all.

2692
02:05:39,580 --> 02:05:41,440
I just think that's fake.
Can I see it again?

2693
02:05:41,441 --> 02:05:45,210
I think you're going to see shit.
I want to see her.

2694
02:05:45,240 --> 02:05:46,250
I got to watch her yet.

2695
02:05:49,810 --> 02:05:52,470
I'll just check the Kelly.
Hi Kay.

2696
02:05:53,380 --> 02:05:56,240
It's what?
Can I be good stuff?

2697
02:05:58,710 --> 02:06:00,960
No did she would have never.

2698
02:06:03,440 --> 02:06:05,410
All
right.

2699
02:06:15,200 --> 02:06:17,960
Lion comes back.
Is he all those things.

2700
02:06:18,060 --> 02:06:20,460
There's so much off their,
first of all why did the line just

2701
02:06:20,461 --> 02:06:22,050
abandon these people that are shooting
it?

2702
02:06:22,530 --> 02:06:24,540
Did it kill them and walk off real
quick?

2703
02:06:24,570 --> 02:06:26,790
That doesn't make sense cause there's
two of them.

2704
02:06:27,090 --> 02:06:30,370
If it killed two of them,
I think it would have killed one and rag

2705
02:06:30,371 --> 02:06:32,670
doll that around a little bit and then
God to the second one.

2706
02:06:32,850 --> 02:06:36,780
It would have taken longer than 10 or 15
seconds and you can add that side effect

2707
02:06:36,781 --> 02:06:38,510
and it's a pain.
Yeah.

2708
02:06:38,640 --> 02:06:41,550
And then the rifle went off and it's
just nothing happened and that they

2709
02:06:41,551 --> 02:06:42,570
missed.
Totally.

2710
02:06:42,630 --> 02:06:45,690
They miss twice.
All that stuff seems fake.

2711
02:06:46,590 --> 02:06:49,320
Just the framing is the big one and then
they're acting.

2712
02:06:49,321 --> 02:06:51,120
Seems like shit too.
I thought they were speaking another

2713
02:06:51,121 --> 02:06:53,820
language.
Apparently the speaking English,

2714
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:58,280
but that goes back to in order to think
about things like that show,

2715
02:06:58,290 --> 02:07:03,120
I literally sit there and go,
humans will believe anything.

2716
02:07:03,140 --> 02:07:05,910
We're not even a thought process.
The will just believe it.

2717
02:07:06,050 --> 02:07:06,781
Yeah,
no,

2718
02:07:06,781 --> 02:07:08,670
it's the video.
I saw it,

2719
02:07:08,850 --> 02:07:10,110
but don't you think that's the,
sorry.

2720
02:07:10,230 --> 02:07:13,020
That's also like a smart video to make,
cause that's what people want to see.

2721
02:07:13,021 --> 02:07:16,020
Like people hate trophy hunting.
They hate this idea that people go over

2722
02:07:16,021 --> 02:07:20,520
there and shoot these lines and then
prop them up and look big smile on their

2723
02:07:20,521 --> 02:07:24,300
face next to some weird animal that they
just shot some majestic beast.

2724
02:07:24,510 --> 02:07:25,740
Right.
It's weird,

2725
02:07:25,741 --> 02:07:27,540
man.
It's all weird.

2726
02:07:27,750 --> 02:07:31,670
What's weird too,
that people are celebrating that this is

2727
02:07:31,680 --> 02:07:35,590
fucking lion came by and jacked him,
went after the lady with the gun.

2728
02:07:35,770 --> 02:07:36,040
You know,

2729
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:38,680
like everybody's like all happy.
The comments,

2730
02:07:38,920 --> 02:07:42,490
comments are all happy.
Like I'm not into killing lions,

2731
02:07:43,090 --> 02:07:45,190
but uh,
I'm definitely not in the lions killing

2732
02:07:45,220 --> 02:07:47,350
people and I don't think that it's like
a,

2733
02:07:47,351 --> 02:07:49,300
it's not a revenge thing.
I,

2734
02:07:49,360 --> 02:07:51,580
that line would have killed them no
matter what they,

2735
02:07:51,670 --> 02:07:53,950
they killed their lions.
That's what they do.

2736
02:07:54,940 --> 02:07:55,970
Yeah,
I,

2737
02:07:56,060 --> 02:07:58,450
I get it.
I get,

2738
02:07:58,451 --> 02:08:03,451
I'll sit there and I'll go like hunting
to me fee like hunting,

2739
02:08:06,110 --> 02:08:10,000
finding out like teas on a reserve.
If you aren't going lion hunting or

2740
02:08:10,010 --> 02:08:11,800
whatever.
If someone owns the land,

2741
02:08:11,920 --> 02:08:12,611
not only that,
they're,

2742
02:08:12,611 --> 02:08:16,510
most of these things are a high fence
operations where they have these lines

2743
02:08:16,511 --> 02:08:18,100
are fenced in.
Right.

2744
02:08:18,600 --> 02:08:20,050
And they go into,
it's like a cheap shot.

2745
02:08:20,051 --> 02:08:22,380
To me it's more than that.
I mean it's,

2746
02:08:22,570 --> 02:08:27,570
it's kind of like shooting Ligo,
dangerous pet that someone has.

2747
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,070
Right.
But technically they're free.

2748
02:08:30,071 --> 02:08:33,120
But are they,
a lot of them are not free.

2749
02:08:33,130 --> 02:08:34,330
No.
That's some sanding and Africa.

2750
02:08:34,360 --> 02:08:35,960
They'd been caught and they tell you,
yeah,

2751
02:08:35,961 --> 02:08:38,980
I know.
If we really breed them in the wild in

2752
02:08:38,981 --> 02:08:39,461
these,
uh,

2753
02:08:39,461 --> 02:08:41,770
these enclosures,
I mean not in the wild.

2754
02:08:41,830 --> 02:08:44,440
In captivity,
they breed them and then they release.

2755
02:08:44,441 --> 02:08:49,120
Sometimes they release them and these
lions have a very specific area that the

2756
02:08:49,230 --> 02:08:51,670
traveling,
and then they release him the lines on

2757
02:08:51,671 --> 02:08:52,120
the,
where to go.

2758
02:08:52,120 --> 02:08:54,940
So they just hang out and wait.
So when they release him,

2759
02:08:54,941 --> 02:08:58,930
then in the morning the hunter in quotes
comes out and sees this line just

2760
02:08:58,931 --> 02:09:01,030
hanging out.
Cause the line doesn't have anywhere to

2761
02:09:01,031 --> 02:09:02,410
go.
It doesn't belong there.

2762
02:09:02,411 --> 02:09:04,720
It's not as territory,
doesn't exactly know what to do.

2763
02:09:04,721 --> 02:09:07,810
So he just finds a place to lie down.
So he'll go under a tree and just lay

2764
02:09:07,811 --> 02:09:10,210
there and then walk over and shoot these
lions.

2765
02:09:10,780 --> 02:09:13,090
It's fucking weird man.
It's like,

2766
02:09:13,091 --> 02:09:14,410
what is that like?
That's,

2767
02:09:14,770 --> 02:09:19,770
that is barely hunting under the loosest
possible definition of the term bear.

2768
02:09:21,131 --> 02:09:25,600
It's barely hunting.
You Know Lion Lions?

2769
02:09:26,050 --> 02:09:27,220
Video's fake.
Yeah,

2770
02:09:27,520 --> 02:09:30,070
I knew it so he can't get me bitch.

2771
02:09:32,710 --> 02:09:35,830
That's a real person is Yolanda.
Oh,

2772
02:09:35,831 --> 02:09:39,190
that's why it looked odd.
See I thought it was almost like a fake

2773
02:09:39,191 --> 02:09:44,191
line deadline might be in the faith part
and they might've actually moving line

2774
02:09:44,201 --> 02:09:45,040
might've been real.
I'm not,

2775
02:09:45,130 --> 02:09:47,110
I'll read more.
It's so weird.

2776
02:09:47,111 --> 02:09:48,850
But you know what's weird about this
whole thing?

2777
02:09:48,851 --> 02:09:50,650
You know,
after Cecil the lion got killed in

2778
02:09:50,651 --> 02:09:54,490
Zimbabwe,
now they have to kill 200 lions because

2779
02:09:54,491 --> 02:09:57,640
they have an excess of lions because
nobody wants to go there.

2780
02:09:57,670 --> 02:10:00,400
And um,
nobody wants to hunt lines anymore

2781
02:10:00,401 --> 02:10:03,970
because the blow back that they
experienced from this cecil thing.

2782
02:10:04,720 --> 02:10:06,850
So now they're,
they're a sas in the cecil thing.

2783
02:10:06,880 --> 02:10:09,070
You know that guy,
that dentist that killed that famous

2784
02:10:09,071 --> 02:10:09,910
lion?
Yes.

2785
02:10:09,911 --> 02:10:11,920
Yes.
That's cecil the lion.

2786
02:10:12,020 --> 02:10:14,020
Okay.
Remember that whole outrage was really

2787
02:10:14,021 --> 02:10:16,090
crazy.
Like everybody got nuts about that.

2788
02:10:16,450 --> 02:10:19,490
And because of that,
nobody wanted to go there to hunt so

2789
02:10:19,491 --> 02:10:22,780
that they have the lines that are
decimating the undulate population.

2790
02:10:23,110 --> 02:10:28,110
So they had to kill 200 lions,
200 lines that would have brought them,

2791
02:10:28,580 --> 02:10:32,170
you know,
I think they get $50,000 a lion when,

2792
02:10:32,200 --> 02:10:33,920
when hunter comes and pays

2793
02:10:33,980 --> 02:10:36,530
to hunt the lion.
So think about that shit.

2794
02:10:36,830 --> 02:10:38,720
They like losing my,
it's a fucked up place.

2795
02:10:38,721 --> 02:10:42,550
Man is a crazy place.
Louis Theroux has a beautiful document,

2796
02:10:42,560 --> 02:10:44,060
if you've never heard me Yap about it
before,

2797
02:10:44,300 --> 02:10:47,270
but it's a documentary about him.
It's he,

2798
02:10:47,320 --> 02:10:51,050
it's on Youtube.
Him going on this African hunting

2799
02:10:51,051 --> 02:10:53,480
expedition with all these Americans.
It's really strange,

2800
02:10:53,990 --> 02:10:57,980
really strange jungle street wars,
but the same that not some sentence.

2801
02:10:57,981 --> 02:11:00,740
So it sounds like fricking jungles treat
wars with the animals,

2802
02:11:01,010 --> 02:11:02,630
but if you really think about it,
you know,

2803
02:11:02,631 --> 02:11:05,000
people get mad here because they don't
live like that.

2804
02:11:05,210 --> 02:11:08,930
They haven't seen well until like a
lando,

2805
02:11:09,110 --> 02:11:14,060
you haven't seen a wild animal snatch.
A family member,

2806
02:11:14,090 --> 02:11:15,530
a friend.
Yeah.

2807
02:11:15,590 --> 02:11:19,310
A child.
So they're accustomed to like whatever

2808
02:11:19,311 --> 02:11:21,620
that thing,
that thing tears me to pieces.

2809
02:11:21,800 --> 02:11:24,920
I still,
I remember my mom getting eaten by that

2810
02:11:24,921 --> 02:11:25,580
thing,
so yeah.

2811
02:11:25,580 --> 02:11:27,740
No,
I have no problem selling him off.

2812
02:11:27,770 --> 02:11:29,300
Taking that thing out.
Yeah,

2813
02:11:29,301 --> 02:11:30,250
there was a recent,
uh,

2814
02:11:30,270 --> 02:11:33,050
there's this guy named Jim shockey and
he's got this great show called

2815
02:11:33,110 --> 02:11:35,390
uncharted.
He's just sort of an adventure,

2816
02:11:35,420 --> 02:11:39,560
travels all over the world and they
hired him to go to Mozambique because

2817
02:11:39,561 --> 02:11:41,870
all these people were getting killed by
crocodiles.

2818
02:11:42,170 --> 02:11:44,120
So he's going,
he goes to Mozambique to hunt

2819
02:11:44,121 --> 02:11:45,590
crocodiles.
And while they were there,

2820
02:11:45,591 --> 02:11:47,930
someone in the camp got killed and eaten
by a crocodile.

2821
02:11:47,931 --> 02:11:50,630
Some woman was washing clothes and get
dragged into the water.

2822
02:11:52,130 --> 02:11:54,200
You know,
you talked to them and like those,

2823
02:11:54,330 --> 02:11:56,960
those people don't,
they don't have any problem with someone

2824
02:11:56,961 --> 02:11:59,180
coming over and shooting a crocodile.
No.

2825
02:11:59,510 --> 02:12:01,460
Cause they said this said they see it.
Yeah.

2826
02:12:01,520 --> 02:12:02,930
There'll be no protests.
Right.

2827
02:12:03,230 --> 02:12:05,960
We don't make movies about this.
There was an article in the New York

2828
02:12:05,961 --> 02:12:09,920
Times after the cecil thing by someone
from Zimbabwe that said in Zimbabwe we

2829
02:12:09,921 --> 02:12:11,570
do not cry for lions.

2830
02:12:12,080 --> 02:12:14,840
And it talked about how all the family
members that had been terrorized,

2831
02:12:14,841 --> 02:12:17,360
all the people they knew that had been
actually killed by lions.

2832
02:12:17,361 --> 02:12:21,110
Like this is not a joke.
Like you guys have this fucking lions

2833
02:12:21,111 --> 02:12:23,360
king version of what's going on over
here.

2834
02:12:23,460 --> 02:12:24,510
Right.
But even then,

2835
02:12:24,580 --> 02:12:26,390
still,
I don't want anybody to shoot a lion.

2836
02:12:26,790 --> 02:12:28,180
Just seems like,
just like anything.

2837
02:12:28,220 --> 02:12:30,110
Then they'll say,
well what weren't they move?

2838
02:12:30,140 --> 02:12:31,490
Well,
you don't know the conditions they are.

2839
02:12:31,500 --> 02:12:34,290
You don't know how far they have to go.
If they got to go across the desert or

2840
02:12:34,300 --> 02:12:39,300
where you can't say anything to you live
in that to live that way of life that

2841
02:12:40,611 --> 02:12:45,140
tries me nuts and people just,
well you know it's going on over there.

2842
02:12:45,170 --> 02:12:47,870
No,
I really don't send far away.

2843
02:12:47,910 --> 02:12:52,250
It's so different than anything we can
ever even possibly imagine happening in

2844
02:12:52,251 --> 02:12:53,930
North America did.

2845
02:12:53,960 --> 02:12:58,960
I'm just worried about my teenagers get
pregnant and my mom's kind of been an id

2846
02:13:00,381 --> 02:13:01,430
here,
so wow.

2847
02:13:01,460 --> 02:13:05,060
They're trying to kick her out of,
of her assistant living.

2848
02:13:05,140 --> 02:13:08,090
Why?
Because she's running out of money and

2849
02:13:08,091 --> 02:13:11,690
um,
her medicare kicked in and all of a

2850
02:13:11,691 --> 02:13:12,351
sudden they're like,
yeah,

2851
02:13:12,351 --> 02:13:15,470
no,
wait till you medicare so you gotta find

2852
02:13:15,471 --> 02:13:16,510
a place for,
you know,

2853
02:13:16,530 --> 02:13:17,780
she'd been here.
It's like,

2854
02:13:19,040 --> 02:13:21,380
that's why sometimes when I go in this
direction,

2855
02:13:22,160 --> 02:13:24,260
I love going there,
but at the end of the day,

2856
02:13:24,590 --> 02:13:27,440
my stance is always,
what am I,

2857
02:13:28,850 --> 02:13:30,530
so now watch this.
No,

2858
02:13:30,870 --> 02:13:34,530
just what I love the fascination of
thinking of it all.

2859
02:13:35,460 --> 02:13:36,810
A crazy.
It always,

2860
02:13:37,010 --> 02:13:39,930
but at the same time ago,
I got to take out the garbage.

2861
02:13:39,931 --> 02:13:44,070
Now let's talk to this kid about fucking
doing this and see if I can find some

2862
02:13:44,071 --> 02:13:47,610
way for my mother alive for another
month.

2863
02:13:48,790 --> 02:13:50,370
It just shit like that.
You know what I mean?

2864
02:13:50,400 --> 02:13:51,780
Yeah.
You can't be worried about Cecil.

2865
02:13:51,950 --> 02:13:54,180
So that worried about fucking cecil.
Yeah.

2866
02:13:54,670 --> 02:13:58,170
And I'm not worried about,
I feel horrible and bad events at the

2867
02:13:58,170 --> 02:14:00,270
end of the day.
I can't control this.

2868
02:14:00,271 --> 02:14:02,630
It's right here.
Or maybe I can,

2869
02:14:02,640 --> 02:14:04,290
I don't know about it,
you know?

2870
02:14:05,560 --> 02:14:07,620
But I like thinking about all of it.
Well,

2871
02:14:07,621 --> 02:14:09,150
the,
the actual variables,

2872
02:14:09,151 --> 02:14:10,710
when you stopped thinking about the
future,

2873
02:14:11,370 --> 02:14:14,910
they get real grim and weird.
They have to to get better.

2874
02:14:14,911 --> 02:14:16,220
No.
Well it's not even that,

2875
02:14:16,230 --> 02:14:18,870
like your body,
like as I'm getting older,

2876
02:14:18,871 --> 02:14:20,250
one of the things that I'm realizing,
I was like,

2877
02:14:20,251 --> 02:14:22,800
get up in the morning,
especially if I work out hard,

2878
02:14:23,010 --> 02:14:25,350
it's fucking harder and harder to do
that.

2879
02:14:25,770 --> 02:14:29,160
Like slowly but surely my body's not
going to be able to do all this stuff

2880
02:14:29,161 --> 02:14:30,180
that I wanted to do anymore.

2881
02:14:30,300 --> 02:14:33,120
But it's just not going to work anymore.
It doesn't matter how much discipline I

2882
02:14:33,121 --> 02:14:34,680
have,
how well I eat,

2883
02:14:35,700 --> 02:14:37,980
it just there's gonna come a point in
time where things just don't work

2884
02:14:37,981 --> 02:14:41,160
anymore.
It's just the fact that's the reality of

2885
02:14:41,161 --> 02:14:41,994
life.
Yup.

2886
02:14:42,140 --> 02:14:45,750
You wake up stiff like Oh and everyday
you're going to wake up a little more

2887
02:14:45,751 --> 02:14:47,340
stiff,
a little more stiff,

2888
02:14:47,840 --> 02:14:52,540
a little more stiff than the monster,
a little more and it doesn't go away in

2889
02:14:52,830 --> 02:14:55,950
a day or how many times.
So the chiropractor and now I'm going to

2890
02:14:55,951 --> 02:15:00,120
take a Ning Chung pow.
The new thing come out from eight in the

2891
02:15:00,121 --> 02:15:05,121
morning to nine 30 is that that back fat
area meat is going to hurt for three,

2892
02:15:05,341 --> 02:15:07,050
four,
five months and I don't know why.

2893
02:15:07,290 --> 02:15:10,670
And I'll have 14 different people
telling me different things and then

2894
02:15:10,710 --> 02:15:14,830
like take this pill and you don't make
me feel that.

2895
02:15:14,850 --> 02:15:18,780
Then we have been alleviating suffering
and Americans from more than 30 years

2896
02:15:18,781 --> 02:15:20,010
now,
30 years.

2897
02:15:20,700 --> 02:15:22,080
30 years.
Wow.

2898
02:15:22,110 --> 02:15:24,960
Look at my lab coat.
Do not trust me.

2899
02:15:25,530 --> 02:15:27,630
Trust protector.
Nope.

2900
02:15:27,631 --> 02:15:30,030
My pen protector.
I'm a cautious person.

2901
02:15:30,390 --> 02:15:32,430
You must be really smart.
Oh look,

2902
02:15:32,431 --> 02:15:37,431
I have a clipboard looking at the charts
and the results and that handwriting is

2903
02:15:37,920 --> 02:15:41,490
completely trustworthy.
You can't understand a word I wrote now,

2904
02:15:41,491 --> 02:15:43,570
but I see a lot of x's and y's and
numbers.

2905
02:15:43,660 --> 02:15:44,820
Do you know,
many people get,

2906
02:15:45,060 --> 02:15:45,920
they get,
uh,

2907
02:15:46,020 --> 02:15:50,730
they overdose and die because of poor
handmaids handwriting or they used to

2908
02:15:50,820 --> 02:15:52,510
now they do everything electronic.
Um,

2909
02:15:52,560 --> 02:15:54,660
my wife,
when she was going through Chemo,

2910
02:15:55,660 --> 02:15:56,520
um,
she would,

2911
02:15:56,700 --> 02:16:01,050
she would take the other thing that
would bounce her out and she went there

2912
02:16:02,220 --> 02:16:07,220
and they gave her the wrong thing and
the wrong dose and she came home and she

2913
02:16:09,421 --> 02:16:12,070
looked like she looked like the creature
from the black lagoon.

2914
02:16:12,071 --> 02:16:14,880
She started getting lumps all over her
body,

2915
02:16:15,180 --> 02:16:17,190
all over her hands.
And they're like,

2916
02:16:17,191 --> 02:16:17,881
yeah,
no,

2917
02:16:17,881 --> 02:16:19,920
that's the uh,
yeah,

2918
02:16:19,921 --> 02:16:20,820
no,
it's normal.

2919
02:16:21,030 --> 02:16:22,170
That's usually,
you know,

2920
02:16:22,171 --> 02:16:23,490
it's one of the side effects.
Just like,

2921
02:16:23,491 --> 02:16:24,250
no,
I had,

2922
02:16:24,250 --> 02:16:27,240
I haven't had this side effect yet.
This is freaking me out.

2923
02:16:27,510 --> 02:16:29,560
Some of the things were going on with
her and charity.

2924
02:16:29,620 --> 02:16:30,040
She had

2925
02:16:30,040 --> 02:16:33,880
no fucking hair ready and know.
It's awful when people go through it,

2926
02:16:33,881 --> 02:16:35,160
it looked like aliens.
People stare.

2927
02:16:35,161 --> 02:16:36,030
You're like,
oh my Gosh,

2928
02:16:36,730 --> 02:16:41,440
dad
can Jesus Christ,

2929
02:16:41,950 --> 02:16:44,080
I support her because she wears the
pants.

2930
02:16:44,920 --> 02:16:45,660
So you,
you,

2931
02:16:45,660 --> 02:16:50,540
you got that going on.
And I think the end of the week they

2932
02:16:50,541 --> 02:16:52,210
were like,
listen,

2933
02:16:53,190 --> 02:16:54,300
uh,
sorry,

2934
02:16:54,690 --> 02:16:57,280
I just realized you got the,
the,

2935
02:16:57,430 --> 02:17:00,240
you know,
the dosage was wrong and that's why,

2936
02:17:00,241 --> 02:17:04,290
and the good news is,
the good news is you won't need it next

2937
02:17:04,291 --> 02:17:09,090
time because you already met your needs
for that type of thing.

2938
02:17:09,150 --> 02:17:10,920
But it's good because it's,
it's uh,

2939
02:17:10,950 --> 02:17:14,670
what you got was really good.
So what they try to do is avoid any sort

2940
02:17:14,671 --> 02:17:17,670
of malpractice lawsuit.
We'll probably,

2941
02:17:18,770 --> 02:17:19,770
yeah,
you don't know.

2942
02:17:19,771 --> 02:17:22,800
Like here's what I gave you see the x,
y clips and all that.

2943
02:17:22,950 --> 02:17:25,170
I just don't understand why their
handwriting would be so shitty.

2944
02:17:25,560 --> 02:17:28,440
Like unless they don't give a fuck.
Like if you're writing a prescription

2945
02:17:28,441 --> 02:17:30,330
for someone,
if I was going to write a prescription

2946
02:17:30,331 --> 02:17:35,050
for Xanax,
but Xanax was like a lot like Zana Lama

2947
02:17:35,051 --> 02:17:37,650
thin,
which fucking kills your Dick like a

2948
02:17:37,651 --> 02:17:41,310
fucking sniper.
And this is how you do it and you just

2949
02:17:41,311 --> 02:17:44,550
sort of x socials.
I mean you look at some of the writings

2950
02:17:44,551 --> 02:17:48,210
that what a doctor's written down
prescription wise and you're like,

2951
02:17:48,211 --> 02:17:50,340
no one can read that.
No one can understand that there's a

2952
02:17:50,341 --> 02:17:53,070
website that charts them like bad
prescriptions,

2953
02:17:53,520 --> 02:17:55,310
like bad hand hand meant writing.
Yeah,

2954
02:17:55,350 --> 02:17:58,590
prescriptions class.
Here's the most important class question

2955
02:17:58,591 --> 02:18:03,591
of the day.
Why can someone tell me why when we sign

2956
02:18:04,291 --> 02:18:07,350
these prescriptions now,
don't forget you're a doctor now.

2957
02:18:07,770 --> 02:18:11,040
You're very busy.
You're on call you 24 seven yeah.

2958
02:18:11,041 --> 02:18:16,041
You're on call at the hospital.
Why do we make this type of signature?

2959
02:18:16,201 --> 02:18:17,850
We're not really sure.
Yes.

2960
02:18:17,851 --> 02:18:21,030
Charlie in the back to make sure we
could never really be sued.

2961
02:18:22,530 --> 02:18:24,480
Excellent Choice Charlie.

2962
02:18:24,570 --> 02:18:26,490
So they make a signature that anybody
could forge.

2963
02:18:27,270 --> 02:18:32,270
Forge or I didn't say that.
My Buddy Guido Orlando,

2964
02:18:32,970 --> 02:18:36,240
he's a pool cue maker.
He's a great guy and Guido had a

2965
02:18:36,241 --> 02:18:37,890
signature.
I'm not bullshitting.

2966
02:18:38,430 --> 02:18:40,000
I'm going to blow up his spot.
I want to,

2967
02:18:40,030 --> 02:18:41,730
I'll show it to you.
I don't want to show everybody else.

2968
02:18:41,731 --> 02:18:44,070
So you want,
I don't want you have steel Guido's

2969
02:18:44,071 --> 02:18:45,990
empire.
This was his signature.

2970
02:18:47,190 --> 02:18:48,750
I'm not kidding.
It was,

2971
02:18:48,751 --> 02:18:50,460
he made an oh,
he made a weird,

2972
02:18:50,490 --> 02:18:53,220
oh,
so his wife forge that shit.

2973
02:18:53,270 --> 02:18:57,690
Cleaned them out when he got divorced.
She and he fucking hated life after that

2974
02:18:57,691 --> 02:18:58,524
man.
Why?

2975
02:18:58,620 --> 02:19:01,290
He was so angry,
so bitter,

2976
02:19:01,530 --> 02:19:02,910
so crushed.
And I was like,

2977
02:19:02,911 --> 02:19:05,580
how the fuck do you think you could just
get by with that crazy signature?

2978
02:19:06,180 --> 02:19:07,013
But he,
uh,

2979
02:19:07,350 --> 02:19:09,050
which you don't,
you don't,

2980
02:19:09,080 --> 02:19:10,640
you.
He's a guy who liked,

2981
02:19:10,660 --> 02:19:12,780
wanted to simplify his life.
It was a very smart guy.

2982
02:19:13,480 --> 02:19:16,350
He decided to simplify his life.
That's how he did it.

2983
02:19:16,351 --> 02:19:16,771
He's like,
oh,

2984
02:19:16,771 --> 02:19:18,810
I don't want this crazy sick.
She make me sign things.

2985
02:19:18,811 --> 02:19:20,640
I think signing things is stupid,
so I'll just do that.

2986
02:19:21,540 --> 02:19:23,850
That's my signature.
He wrote it on everything,

2987
02:19:24,450 --> 02:19:26,060
but he thought he was slick.
Mm.

2988
02:19:26,310 --> 02:19:28,190
Look at this doctor's prescription.

2989
02:19:28,580 --> 02:19:29,440
Wow.
Yeah.

2990
02:19:30,500 --> 02:19:33,950
Why don't you just give me a bullet,
shoot me right in the fucking head.

2991
02:19:34,270 --> 02:19:37,580
Just this crazy,
this reading that is insane.

2992
02:19:37,581 --> 02:19:40,490
Like no one can read that.
I bet he can't even read that.

2993
02:19:41,570 --> 02:19:44,780
It's amazing.
7,000 people annually die from bad

2994
02:19:45,560 --> 02:19:47,450
handwriting.
It used to be way worse though.

2995
02:19:47,690 --> 02:19:49,910
This is a 2006 yeah.
Okay,

2996
02:19:49,911 --> 02:19:51,590
so that's probably what it is.
They figured out.

2997
02:19:51,640 --> 02:19:53,750
All right,
how much is it costing us in lawsuits

2998
02:19:53,870 --> 02:19:58,340
and [inaudible] 14 feet.
How much have we made in the last two

2999
02:19:58,341 --> 02:20:00,470
years?
So that would be 50 trillion.

3000
02:20:00,530 --> 02:20:03,230
All right then.
This is not a battle then.

3001
02:20:03,560 --> 02:20:05,660
It's worth the over doses.
Please.

3002
02:20:05,960 --> 02:20:10,130
I talked about Penny's think Dr.
Schwartz maximum four hours a day.

3003
02:20:10,610 --> 02:20:13,130
Unless they have to do surgery,
they should be well rested and taken

3004
02:20:13,131 --> 02:20:16,400
care of and they should be more of them.
And let me ask you this Jamie,

3005
02:20:16,520 --> 02:20:18,620
how many people die from malpractice
guests?

3006
02:20:18,621 --> 02:20:22,340
This let's guess this.
I say a day.

3007
02:20:22,341 --> 02:20:23,240
A year.
A year.

3008
02:20:23,540 --> 02:20:26,620
How many malpractice?
Just fuck ups.

3009
02:20:26,690 --> 02:20:28,520
Just mistakes.
Accidents.

3010
02:20:29,240 --> 02:20:32,210
Um,
I'm going to say like to me

3011
02:20:32,400 --> 02:20:34,520
what?
30 grand.

3012
02:20:34,530 --> 02:20:36,910
I was going to say 30.
Oh my God.

3013
02:20:37,160 --> 02:20:42,160
I lagging,
I might say complete manslaughter.

3014
02:20:44,790 --> 02:20:47,370
Running cross the land.
Like fucking fields of buffalo.

3015
02:20:49,760 --> 02:20:50,620
Chop Chop.

3016
02:20:53,250 --> 02:20:55,830
98,000 a whoa.
Yeah,

3017
02:20:55,850 --> 02:20:57,880
I was off by a year.
I was.

3018
02:20:57,940 --> 02:20:59,700
Okay.
This is 15 years ago though,

3019
02:20:59,701 --> 02:21:03,900
so this is 2000 2009 they did this.
You would think it'd be 10 times better

3020
02:21:03,901 --> 02:21:05,520
today though.
No fucking Amen.

3021
02:21:05,910 --> 02:21:08,490
She'd be like 20 it's still to be these
teen.

3022
02:21:08,580 --> 02:21:12,570
That's how nutty number man.
98,000 people die.

3023
02:21:12,630 --> 02:21:15,060
Is that just America due to errors?
Yeah.

3024
02:21:16,580 --> 02:21:21,240
Check out mistake that was made on a
prescription.

3025
02:21:21,480 --> 02:21:25,020
Can you guess what that says?
Methadone that don't yet know.

3026
02:21:25,021 --> 02:21:27,990
It says method date,
which is this is for a child.

3027
02:21:28,100 --> 02:21:29,520
Where's the tea?
Yeah,

3028
02:21:29,580 --> 02:21:32,280
this is just supposed to be the tea.
Oh my God.

3029
02:21:32,640 --> 02:21:35,930
And so a child got Methadone and died.
I must have.

3030
02:21:35,940 --> 02:21:37,320
Yeah,
I'm pretty sure it was lost that.

3031
02:21:37,410 --> 02:21:39,690
Oh,
I didn't want to hear it and think of

3032
02:21:39,691 --> 02:21:42,720
that.
You're the one adhd medicine.

3033
02:21:42,930 --> 02:21:44,370
Oh my God.
I think you this.

3034
02:21:44,400 --> 02:21:45,750
Well.
You know that's fucking crazy.

3035
02:21:45,751 --> 02:21:47,880
Anyway,
you and shit to a kid.

3036
02:21:47,970 --> 02:21:51,850
You gave that to your kid and trusted
and kids like,

3037
02:21:53,370 --> 02:21:55,620
trust me honey,
you need it.

3038
02:21:55,770 --> 02:21:59,160
You saw the man with the coat.
The man with the lab coat tells you that

3039
02:21:59,161 --> 02:22:01,320
you need this.
This is going to make you popular in

3040
02:22:01,321 --> 02:22:05,790
school and you saw the kids at the rite
aid counter or you take Dave,

3041
02:22:05,850 --> 02:22:08,730
they're very trustworthy.
You interrupting class because you've

3042
02:22:08,731 --> 02:22:11,670
got something wrong with your brain.
The doctor's going to fix it.

3043
02:22:11,850 --> 02:22:15,180
This test shows that and proves that
this test shows right here.

3044
02:22:15,181 --> 02:22:18,120
There's something wrong in your little
second grade brain,

3045
02:22:18,240 --> 02:22:19,680
sweetie.
It's in a clipboard.

3046
02:22:20,370 --> 02:22:24,000
It's right.
It's believable and here's the best

3047
02:22:24,001 --> 02:22:26,100
part.
We're for it.

3048
02:22:27,300 --> 02:22:30,390
We're covered for this insurance mean we
covered for the kid,

3049
02:22:30,600 --> 02:22:32,010
the kid,
it's everything covered.

3050
02:22:32,280 --> 02:22:34,050
They're covered for everything.

3051
02:22:34,050 --> 02:22:36,300
Beautiful.
Thank you for having this job and

3052
02:22:36,301 --> 02:22:37,980
support it as colorful.
Don't.

3053
02:22:38,310 --> 02:22:39,450
What's my thought?
Oh yes,

3054
02:22:39,451 --> 02:22:42,200
it's good because it's going to help him
method.

3055
02:22:42,890 --> 02:22:47,040
Now I'm looking,
I'm researching this Bob and it says,

3056
02:22:47,880 --> 02:22:50,340
this is,
this could kill you and this should

3057
02:22:50,341 --> 02:22:54,420
never be given to children.
What about the days before Google when

3058
02:22:54,421 --> 02:22:56,130
you,
your doctor could give you some advice

3059
02:22:56,131 --> 02:22:58,530
and you had no idea whether or not it
was the right advice or not.

3060
02:22:59,550 --> 02:23:02,040
But how about even trust in this
scenario when you look it up,

3061
02:23:02,080 --> 02:23:07,080
if fiercely says don't give this Nigga.
Well it was the doctor said I should

3062
02:23:09,150 --> 02:23:13,410
dude crazy is that it's crazy.
And then the idea that you can't even

3063
02:23:13,411 --> 02:23:15,090
make a tea,
you lazy cunt.

3064
02:23:15,360 --> 02:23:17,190
You're writing a prescription for a
fucking kid.

3065
02:23:17,640 --> 02:23:20,560
Cross a t for child.
Let's see.

3066
02:23:20,561 --> 02:23:25,561
And what was this named heroin?
So while she's checking her phone,

3067
02:23:27,880 --> 02:23:30,000
thinking about some new Jaguar,
he's going to buy,

3068
02:23:30,050 --> 02:23:32,430
right?
I'm going to buy a vacation home this

3069
02:23:32,430 --> 02:23:35,670
summer after all my surgery money,
I couldn't hear the noise coming out of

3070
02:23:35,671 --> 02:23:39,420
my muffler off.
I'll get a new gal.

3071
02:23:39,510 --> 02:23:43,980
I'm success.
Perhaps I should smoke a pipe while I'm

3072
02:23:43,981 --> 02:23:45,450
driving around my job wall.

3073
02:23:47,700 --> 02:23:50,850
Sophisticated English hats.
They had like peaks on both sides.

3074
02:23:50,851 --> 02:23:52,530
Try to impact,
try to bring you down.

3075
02:23:53,010 --> 02:23:56,610
You grew up in the bronx,
stop putting on airs,

3076
02:23:56,790 --> 02:23:57,750
shut up.
Hasn't,

3077
02:23:58,260 --> 02:24:03,260
I've elevated my status status is
elevated private and around smoking my

3078
02:24:04,351 --> 02:24:06,480
pipe.
That's you gotta just classy bitch to

3079
02:24:06,481 --> 02:24:08,190
drive around with a pipe,
right?

3080
02:24:08,490 --> 02:24:11,240
Yes.
Would you like to come and mine?

3081
02:24:11,760 --> 02:24:13,350
Yes.
Contemplates things.

3082
02:24:13,950 --> 02:24:18,950
Would you like to come in my yard and
see if the new zebra and Giraffe,

3083
02:24:19,081 --> 02:24:19,914
I just pet

3084
02:24:25,780 --> 02:24:26,613
face.

3085
02:24:27,230 --> 02:24:28,610
I'm just thinking if this is my
neighbor,

3086
02:24:28,611 --> 02:24:29,444
I'd be like,
fuck it.

3087
02:24:29,450 --> 02:24:31,820
I should probably just humor this guy.
Go see a zebra.

3088
02:24:31,821 --> 02:24:34,640
Just so he doesn't hate me.
I don't want to live next to this crazy

3089
02:24:34,641 --> 02:24:38,630
fucking zoo owner.
He's going to make some poisonous snake.

3090
02:24:38,631 --> 02:24:42,120
You mocked me for my z.
Put into your mouth and now the point is

3091
02:24:42,121 --> 02:24:43,490
this snake.
Is he in your room?

3092
02:24:43,900 --> 02:24:45,590
It's changed.
We could have been friends.

3093
02:24:45,920 --> 02:24:48,440
This damp giraffe just stayed.
All your Bush,

3094
02:24:48,470 --> 02:24:50,750
Claire.
I haven't had it would just fucking zoo

3095
02:24:50,760 --> 02:24:55,200
keeper keeper.
Imagine your next door neighbor is a

3096
02:24:55,210 --> 02:24:57,230
goddamn zookeeper.
What the fuck,

3097
02:24:57,231 --> 02:24:58,610
man,
this is what you hear at night.

3098
02:24:59,570 --> 02:25:04,570
Oh,
fucking noises.

3099
02:25:21,350 --> 02:25:22,880
The beast,
the

3100
02:25:24,530 --> 02:25:25,363
woo.

3101
02:25:27,630 --> 02:25:30,470
The worst.
Imagine you are in your Land Rover

3102
02:25:30,471 --> 02:25:33,230
defender trying to get away from the
encampment.

3103
02:25:33,500 --> 02:25:35,780
You're driving away and you get a flat
and you're like,

3104
02:25:35,781 --> 02:25:37,010
what should we do?
Well,

3105
02:25:37,011 --> 02:25:38,600
we should definitely wait until the
morning.

3106
02:25:38,630 --> 02:25:40,490
We can't see.
I don't have a light.

3107
02:25:40,491 --> 02:25:41,960
We can't see.
I can't change it.

3108
02:25:42,530 --> 02:25:45,220
And then as you're sleeping in that
fucking land rover here,

3109
02:25:45,340 --> 02:25:46,970
well,
Hey,

3110
02:25:51,960 --> 02:25:54,700
you look out there,
there's 30 of them with their paws on

3111
02:25:54,701 --> 02:25:58,270
the fucking hood.
And then you hear way,

3112
02:25:58,271 --> 02:25:59,290
way,
way in the distance,

3113
02:25:59,320 --> 02:26:04,320
way the distance.
Oh,

3114
02:26:10,120 --> 02:26:12,750
that sound.
Oh,

3115
02:26:16,510 --> 02:26:19,840
they're all running.
His guys explained it to me.

3116
02:26:19,930 --> 02:26:21,880
Elephants,
why they kill elephants?

3117
02:26:22,060 --> 02:26:23,500
He's like,
it's not.

3118
02:26:23,501 --> 02:26:25,750
He goes,
it's not just that people want to go

3119
02:26:25,751 --> 02:26:29,020
over and trophy hunt these things.
Sometimes the elephants will move into a

3120
02:26:29,021 --> 02:26:32,710
village and these farmers,
they have these plots of food for the

3121
02:26:32,711 --> 02:26:35,610
village and it's all they have.
And these elephants move in,

3122
02:26:35,620 --> 02:26:38,350
just eat everything.
It's not a goddamn thing they can do.

3123
02:26:38,380 --> 02:26:39,790
There's nothing you could do.
Nothing.

3124
02:26:39,791 --> 02:26:40,640
They can do.
The dinosaur,

3125
02:26:40,680 --> 02:26:45,040
a dinosaur just came in and his way,
he's been living forever.

3126
02:26:45,070 --> 02:26:48,940
And you to start with spear and it is
three of them or four of them,

3127
02:26:49,170 --> 02:26:50,950
right?
They're coming from every angle now,

3128
02:26:51,100 --> 02:26:52,820
what the fuck are you going to do?
And so you have all this,

3129
02:26:52,870 --> 02:26:55,930
these vegetables are you growing for
your family and you're fucked.

3130
02:26:56,130 --> 02:26:58,240
How long did it take you to build his
fucking hut?

3131
02:26:59,500 --> 02:27:01,160
Gone.
They just jacked seconds.

3132
02:27:01,610 --> 02:27:03,670
It is Jackie.
And if they think you're a threat in any

3133
02:27:03,671 --> 02:27:05,230
way,
they just eliminate that threat.

3134
02:27:05,680 --> 02:27:07,030
Just go pick you up and throw you.

3135
02:27:07,410 --> 02:27:09,090
Yeah Dude,

3136
02:27:10,020 --> 02:27:11,160
go ahead.
Get your spear.

3137
02:27:11,250 --> 02:27:12,880
You see where you'll French just landed?
Yeah,

3138
02:27:12,881 --> 02:27:14,010
because I was arguing.
I was like,

3139
02:27:14,440 --> 02:27:16,320
what?
Why would they ever need to kill an

3140
02:27:16,321 --> 02:27:17,970
elephant?
Like you don't ever need to kill an

3141
02:27:17,971 --> 02:27:18,960
elephant.
And Guy was like,

3142
02:27:18,980 --> 02:27:21,420
oh actually here's what goes on.
And I was like,

3143
02:27:21,480 --> 02:27:22,980
oh.
So they,

3144
02:27:23,040 --> 02:27:24,960
they,
they hire people to go and kill the

3145
02:27:24,961 --> 02:27:29,580
elephant or they'll give someone a
permit to kill the elephant.

3146
02:27:29,581 --> 02:27:33,630
Then that person pays like 50,000 bucks
or something like that and they'll come

3147
02:27:33,631 --> 02:27:36,060
and kill the elephant.
So some guy like that,

3148
02:27:36,450 --> 02:27:38,400
those hunters,
the fake hunters for that thing,

3149
02:27:38,401 --> 02:27:41,340
they'll pose with it and you know,
show the ivory and everything like that.

3150
02:27:41,341 --> 02:27:44,940
And then they give all the meat to the
village and then the village gets 50

3151
02:27:44,941 --> 02:27:49,080
grand.
We get charged when I remember I was in

3152
02:27:49,081 --> 02:27:51,930
Africa
and the guy was like,

3153
02:27:51,931 --> 02:27:54,810
listen,
they don't did they never charge,

3154
02:27:54,840 --> 02:27:57,390
they'll charge but it's always to spook
you.

3155
02:27:58,440 --> 02:28:01,220
And my nine year old,
oh,

3156
02:28:02,090 --> 02:28:05,370
it's in the cheap in front of us,
uh,

3157
02:28:05,371 --> 02:28:08,370
with another kid or whatever.
And we came,

3158
02:28:08,371 --> 02:28:11,370
we get,
we were by a herd and as things turned

3159
02:28:11,371 --> 02:28:12,204
around

3160
02:28:13,100 --> 02:28:13,933
and then

3161
02:28:15,310 --> 02:28:17,920
the one we thought was going to charge a
different one charge,

3162
02:28:18,340 --> 02:28:21,500
they called it a teenager.
It ran and went right for kids.

3163
02:28:21,501 --> 02:28:25,880
Jeep hit the cheese and then pushed it
about 10 feet.

3164
02:28:26,480 --> 02:28:31,220
And I went through everything where like
it's going to knock over the vehicle and

3165
02:28:31,221 --> 02:28:36,221
then just start smushing and this guy
got out of the van and he just,

3166
02:28:37,190 --> 02:28:39,470
he starts clapping,
he's clapping,

3167
02:28:39,630 --> 02:28:40,920
ah,
bold about dope

3168
02:28:43,250 --> 02:28:48,250
and a thing kinda stopped and shook his
head and then went back off it.

3169
02:28:50,280 --> 02:28:55,280
It was those things like,
I can't imagine living there and just

3170
02:28:56,001 --> 02:29:01,001
what you said because just that flash
where the kid was just in a cheap that

3171
02:29:01,340 --> 02:29:03,920
there was no stopping us this thing,
once it started moving,

3172
02:29:04,460 --> 02:29:05,810
there was no worry.
Okay.

3173
02:29:05,811 --> 02:29:09,350
You have like a two seconds to react.
There is no,

3174
02:29:09,470 --> 02:29:11,510
it's coming.
It's coming.

3175
02:29:11,870 --> 02:29:12,830
It's coming.

3176
02:29:12,950 --> 02:29:17,620
He was far away and within seconds he
was on it and it just,

3177
02:29:18,260 --> 02:29:21,260
I watched and shock.
So they just don't want people driving

3178
02:29:21,261 --> 02:29:22,160
through.
Is that what it is?

3179
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:25,070
Duran was a territory and they also
have,

3180
02:29:25,071 --> 02:29:27,080
they've seen,
they probably seen hunters,

3181
02:29:27,081 --> 02:29:30,620
so they associate now chiefs is like,
whoa.

3182
02:29:30,621 --> 02:29:32,420
I was just thinking to shoot us.
Well I don't care,

3183
02:29:32,421 --> 02:29:34,430
but it lost my brother.
I'm taking it out.

3184
02:29:34,970 --> 02:29:37,050
They have crazy memories apparently.
Yeah.

3185
02:29:38,040 --> 02:29:40,340
This is,
isn't that the vehicle that came when we

3186
02:29:40,341 --> 02:29:44,160
were at the watering hole and he sliced
my get it.

3187
02:29:44,650 --> 02:29:48,000
Fuck.
Getting good at it.

3188
02:29:48,070 --> 02:29:49,820
You know,
I don't see myself going over there.

3189
02:29:50,510 --> 02:29:51,500
No,
I think you'd like it.

3190
02:29:52,890 --> 02:29:55,100
Abuse area.
You were on a fucking spear hunt.

3191
02:29:55,160 --> 02:29:56,330
Yeah,
but it was awesome.

3192
02:29:56,390 --> 02:30:01,390
Stay Buck.
I think about that crazy.

3193
02:30:01,870 --> 02:30:06,190
You here behind you
honey,

3194
02:30:06,260 --> 02:30:08,780
right through the fucking Cobra.
Oh,

3195
02:30:09,200 --> 02:30:10,730
see I didn't even think about stuff like
that.

3196
02:30:10,731 --> 02:30:13,120
The heck was I think some Cobra.
Awesome.

3197
02:30:13,250 --> 02:30:14,083
Funny.

3198
02:30:17,460 --> 02:30:18,293
Okay.

3199
02:30:18,490 --> 02:30:20,410
Moons ass.
So I can't really tell what it is.

3200
02:30:20,560 --> 02:30:25,270
Imagine how fucked up you have to be
to be a cobra.

3201
02:30:25,720 --> 02:30:26,553
Mind.
You Cook,

3202
02:30:26,640 --> 02:30:30,940
you're growing poison in your head and
you shoot it out of your teeth.

3203
02:30:31,360 --> 02:30:35,440
You bite people and inject them.
You are literally a walking needle.

3204
02:30:35,500 --> 02:30:37,030
You're a needle.
Yes.

3205
02:30:37,180 --> 02:30:39,940
You're a walking overdose needle.
A poison needle.

3206
02:30:40,090 --> 02:30:43,930
Yeah.
Poison needle and some of them use you

3207
02:30:43,931 --> 02:30:47,330
just a hundred percent death.
Some of them it's 100% like the,

3208
02:30:47,331 --> 02:30:50,320
you know,
I know people get bitten to make enough

3209
02:30:50,321 --> 02:30:51,970
antivenom.
You're never going to get it.

3210
02:30:52,270 --> 02:30:53,500
Yeah.
Everybody get in time.

3211
02:30:53,580 --> 02:30:55,960
Yeah.
Who's carrying that you carry with you

3212
02:30:55,961 --> 02:30:58,060
everywhere.
Only lasts a little while.

3213
02:30:58,110 --> 02:31:00,070
Who is carrying that could keep making
it.

3214
02:31:00,220 --> 02:31:02,560
They make it with horses too.
Do you know that what?

3215
02:31:02,590 --> 02:31:04,480
Like rattlesnake venom?
Antivenom.

3216
02:31:04,900 --> 02:31:07,270
They shoot horses up with it.
They,

3217
02:31:07,390 --> 02:31:10,930
they take a rattlesnake in Jack
rattlesnake venom and the horse,

3218
02:31:11,120 --> 02:31:11,710
the,
this,

3219
02:31:11,710 --> 02:31:15,970
the horse curlex the antibodies produces
antibodies and they take those

3220
02:31:15,971 --> 02:31:18,850
antibodies out.
And that's like the serum entheos really

3221
02:31:19,160 --> 02:31:20,010
mean.
At least they used to do

3222
02:31:20,010 --> 02:31:21,780
it that way.
I'm pretty sure they still do though.

3223
02:31:22,050 --> 02:31:22,890
I know it's,
um,

3224
02:31:22,920 --> 02:31:26,460
it's an issue for vegans because if
vegans don't want to use any animal

3225
02:31:26,461 --> 02:31:30,210
products and they get bitten by a snake,
like they have to compromise.

3226
02:31:32,120 --> 02:31:34,740
That has to be some,
there has to be some compromise here.

3227
02:31:36,300 --> 02:31:39,000
Yeah.
I don't get,

3228
02:31:39,001 --> 02:31:40,380
I don't get all that.
I get it,

3229
02:31:40,381 --> 02:31:41,520
but I don't get it.
I get it.

3230
02:31:41,730 --> 02:31:43,590
I get it.
They want to be nice.

3231
02:31:43,860 --> 02:31:45,480
They want to be righteous.
It wouldn't be a good person.

3232
02:31:45,630 --> 02:31:48,180
Is it nice?
Is it the fight for matter?

3233
02:31:48,360 --> 02:31:52,170
Cruelty in general,
I think ultimately cruelties terrible.

3234
02:31:52,230 --> 02:31:52,941
You know,
the,

3235
02:31:52,941 --> 02:31:55,650
our,
our real problem is a factory farming.

3236
02:31:55,770 --> 02:31:57,060
Our real problem is,
uh,

3237
02:31:57,080 --> 02:32:00,630
the cruelty to animals.
It's not eating animals a real problem

3238
02:32:00,631 --> 02:32:02,200
going because they're going to die.
They're going to live,

3239
02:32:02,201 --> 02:32:02,730
they're going to die.

3240
02:32:02,730 --> 02:32:04,740
And I know you can say that argument
about people too.

3241
02:32:04,741 --> 02:32:08,600
Why don't you see you be blue?
Because people are people and we're

3242
02:32:08,640 --> 02:32:10,350
different than cows.
Okay.

3243
02:32:11,160 --> 02:32:12,540
Yeah,
but don't you see to tell you this?

3244
02:32:12,600 --> 02:32:14,220
Listen,
we all know this.

3245
02:32:14,330 --> 02:32:15,810
Yeah.
This is what I would say.

3246
02:32:15,811 --> 02:32:20,100
We all know all of this.
You can go to a factory and see it.

3247
02:32:20,490 --> 02:32:21,780
He didn't go to any factor.
Anything.

3248
02:32:21,781 --> 02:32:22,790
Chickens,
any Ame,

3249
02:32:22,800 --> 02:32:25,650
everything you love.
Write down the plants.

3250
02:32:25,800 --> 02:32:28,140
Yup.
Anything.

3251
02:32:28,170 --> 02:32:31,800
It's all been manufactured.
Well now what are you into?

3252
02:32:32,190 --> 02:32:33,930
What are you can,
you can just get a barking here.

3253
02:32:33,931 --> 02:32:35,610
Down the street.
Wear a sign.

3254
02:32:35,790 --> 02:32:36,930
Yeah.
At least pork.

3255
02:32:36,960 --> 02:32:37,793
Chicken.
Sure.

3256
02:32:37,930 --> 02:32:42,930
I didn't really grasp ed where at the
same time you're buying the tee shirt to

3257
02:32:44,851 --> 02:32:46,440
watch the bread.
No

3258
02:32:46,540 --> 02:32:51,540
show at home or you got about how many
shares with we by today by ban and I

3259
02:32:52,460 --> 02:32:53,820
died tonight and I'm fine.

3260
02:32:54,070 --> 02:32:55,700
Make America great again.

3261
02:32:56,990 --> 02:32:58,550
Hello?
Hello.

3262
02:33:01,970 --> 02:33:06,970
They're building walls in Wisconsin.
They're building walls at North Dakota.

3263
02:33:07,320 --> 02:33:10,140
They're building walls and half
American.

3264
02:33:14,520 --> 02:33:17,370
The only way to keep the Mexicans out of
each individual state is wall to wall

3265
02:33:17,371 --> 02:33:18,510
off.
If we want them all off,

3266
02:33:18,511 --> 02:33:20,340
we can keep them from getting in.
Once we find them,

3267
02:33:20,341 --> 02:33:22,230
we have a mold off in the air,
then we get them,

3268
02:33:22,231 --> 02:33:24,270
we send them to Mexico.
The only way he's not one wall.

3269
02:33:24,390 --> 02:33:28,560
We need 50 walls in a wall over each
individual state.

3270
02:33:28,590 --> 02:33:31,620
That way we can contain anyone who
causes a problem.

3271
02:33:32,580 --> 02:33:34,140
First,
we'll start with Mexicans and we'll work

3272
02:33:34,141 --> 02:33:36,660
our way up to really a rude white
people.

3273
02:33:37,290 --> 02:33:42,290
If you wear any type of cloth around
your head,

3274
02:33:44,130 --> 02:33:45,610
you shall be

3275
02:33:45,890 --> 02:33:48,730
boss actually said,
but what about do

3276
02:33:48,730 --> 02:33:52,120
rags?
What if those come back to Greg's all

3277
02:33:52,121 --> 02:33:54,840
sudden become huge.
Okay.

3278
02:33:54,940 --> 02:33:56,610
At 14,
uh,

3279
02:33:56,650 --> 02:33:58,980
miss happy headings today.
Okay,

3280
02:33:59,030 --> 02:34:00,700
but,
but there's going to be a racial problem

3281
02:34:00,760 --> 02:34:03,310
cause doo rags.
They might have some pushback on that,

3282
02:34:03,311 --> 02:34:07,450
but what about the Bandanna that Bret
michaels from poison?

3283
02:34:07,451 --> 02:34:09,130
Worse.
That's a tough,

3284
02:34:09,131 --> 02:34:12,610
that's a gray zone
because he's white.

3285
02:34:12,730 --> 02:34:15,040
It's crazy.
That's white privilege is a gang.

3286
02:34:15,041 --> 02:34:16,990
He's in a gang.
He said he's a rocker.

3287
02:34:17,470 --> 02:34:18,340
Yeah,
that's a gang.

3288
02:34:18,700 --> 02:34:21,280
So you need tattoos and you need to
sing.

3289
02:34:21,400 --> 02:34:24,280
He needed at least one song and he's got
more than one.

3290
02:34:25,040 --> 02:34:29,020
Every rose has its dawn.
He's wearing the forbidden garb.

3291
02:34:31,630 --> 02:34:33,940
Beautiful Hair.
Not Real beautiful though.

3292
02:34:35,230 --> 02:34:37,120
Interesting.
Look axl rose too,

3293
02:34:37,150 --> 02:34:42,150
but axl rose.
Axl rose can kind of pull it off better

3294
02:34:44,171 --> 02:34:45,400
for whatever.
Well that's strange.

3295
02:34:45,420 --> 02:34:46,253
It's strange.
Look.

3296
02:34:47,140 --> 02:34:48,130
Yeah.
I don't know.

3297
02:34:48,340 --> 02:34:49,330
It's this thing though,
man.

3298
02:34:49,420 --> 02:34:50,740
You know.
Maybe that's,

3299
02:34:51,070 --> 02:34:54,580
maybe it's a good move if you dress like
that all the time.

3300
02:34:54,610 --> 02:34:56,760
That way when you take that shit off,
nobody recognize you.

3301
02:34:56,770 --> 02:34:58,840
Anywhere you go.
Maybe that's the move,

3302
02:35:00,040 --> 02:35:01,270
right?
That could be.

3303
02:35:01,350 --> 02:35:04,450
It could be the move where the Bandana,
beautiful eyes.

3304
02:35:05,290 --> 02:35:06,850
Beautiful Man.
Does that real?

3305
02:35:07,110 --> 02:35:09,190
I think he put that through like one of
them instagram filters.

3306
02:35:12,820 --> 02:35:13,653
Whoa.
Hey,

3307
02:35:13,660 --> 02:35:17,170
why are you pulling your pants down bro?
Put a fucking shirt on and get a good

3308
02:35:17,171 --> 02:35:18,660
six buck though.
Didn't know his so built.

3309
02:35:19,540 --> 02:35:20,590
All right enough,
Jamie.

3310
02:35:20,591 --> 02:35:22,570
I'm getting hard.
Let's move on.

3311
02:35:23,630 --> 02:35:25,510
Jim Brewer.
What are you doing in town?

3312
02:35:27,040 --> 02:35:27,930
But hold on.
Okay.

3313
02:35:27,960 --> 02:35:28,793
Okay.
I can,

3314
02:35:30,150 --> 02:35:34,920
I get as much as that drives me nuts and
I,

3315
02:35:34,940 --> 02:35:37,000
I can,
I can tip my hat

3316
02:35:38,800 --> 02:35:39,633
to him.
Just gone.

3317
02:35:40,020 --> 02:35:42,180
I'm in the system.
I got to,

3318
02:35:42,340 --> 02:35:46,570
I got to create my wrestling character.
Here's my character,

3319
02:35:46,571 --> 02:35:47,820
right?
I live in this system.

3320
02:35:47,821 --> 02:35:50,050
We're all slaves.
Are we not all slaves to something?

3321
02:35:50,080 --> 02:35:51,550
Do you think he's thinking like that
now?

3322
02:35:51,551 --> 02:35:52,970
I don't know.
He's fine money,

3323
02:35:52,980 --> 02:35:54,340
man.
It's good business.

3324
02:35:54,440 --> 02:35:57,100
Just bought a boat.
He's got a new place in Miami.

3325
02:35:57,101 --> 02:35:59,590
She's,
you don't have to worry about nothing.

3326
02:35:59,620 --> 02:36:01,270
What does that picture,
what's going on there?

3327
02:36:01,510 --> 02:36:03,940
Why did you have lipstick on?
Why not worked?

3328
02:36:04,180 --> 02:36:07,090
Worked for awhile.
Remember they all were glammed up.

3329
02:36:07,260 --> 02:36:08,950
I remember the early guns and roses
even.

3330
02:36:08,951 --> 02:36:09,820
He was glammed up.
Well,

3331
02:36:09,940 --> 02:36:13,180
they were very glammed up hair number
and go forget that.

3332
02:36:13,330 --> 02:36:14,410
No,
they wear a hairband.

3333
02:36:14,440 --> 02:36:15,610
Remember?
Welcome to the jungle.

3334
02:36:15,670 --> 02:36:17,140
Remember the video?
Full blown hair.

3335
02:36:17,170 --> 02:36:18,640
Oh,
I had that straight.

3336
02:36:18,641 --> 02:36:21,550
Almost like Afro when he,
when he landed,

3337
02:36:22,180 --> 02:36:24,210
when he landed in La,
remember?

3338
02:36:24,310 --> 02:36:29,310
Right.
They did their makeup eye line.

3339
02:36:29,981 --> 02:36:31,030
Is that island or is it,
no,

3340
02:36:31,031 --> 02:36:32,500
that's a shot there.
Beautiful.

3341
02:36:32,560 --> 02:36:34,240
It's just natural,
natural beauty.

3342
02:36:35,350 --> 02:36:37,270
They were the baddest motherfuckers at
the time.

3343
02:36:37,930 --> 02:36:39,820
Crazy.
How hard that was for them to handle

3344
02:36:40,270 --> 02:36:42,380
though.
That was all wild quick apps.

3345
02:36:42,381 --> 02:36:44,020
Right.
It's interesting to see them touring

3346
02:36:44,021 --> 02:36:44,621
again.
Now,

3347
02:36:44,621 --> 02:36:48,040
you know they did coachella.
I saw some videos of it look wild.

3348
02:36:48,610 --> 02:36:49,270
Sitting out there.

3349
02:36:49,270 --> 02:36:50,500
He had a broken foot,
so he's,

3350
02:36:50,610 --> 02:36:52,210
it was doing all his dancing from a
chair.

3351
02:36:52,690 --> 02:36:53,800
You see it?
Yeah.

3352
02:36:55,120 --> 02:36:58,450
You know you're fucking rock stars are
getting old.

3353
02:36:58,770 --> 02:37:01,720
They're dancing from a chair.
They're doing like the chair wiggle.

3354
02:37:01,870 --> 02:37:06,460
I felt like I went to professional
wrestling when I was 10 and it was

3355
02:37:06,520 --> 02:37:09,970
Andre.
The giant was the ref and I already

3356
02:37:09,971 --> 02:37:14,260
bought my shirts.
It was bob backlund against dusty rose,

3357
02:37:14,261 --> 02:37:17,870
the American dream,
and I noticed they weren't hitting each

3358
02:37:17,871 --> 02:37:20,330
other
and then I,

3359
02:37:20,750 --> 02:37:23,330
I noticed they were stumped and her
foot's every time the elbow.

3360
02:37:24,110 --> 02:37:28,550
And then I saw Andre the giant take a
chair and not really hit him and I was

3361
02:37:29,270 --> 02:37:31,790
shattered.
You saw it in real life and I went,

3362
02:37:32,030 --> 02:37:35,150
oh no,
this is all just to show.

3363
02:37:36,260 --> 02:37:38,030
How does that happen?
Yes.

3364
02:37:38,440 --> 02:37:41,780
It's got a foot brace.
[inaudible] Keith Richards.

3365
02:37:41,830 --> 02:37:45,200
That is what a shot himself up with
heroin and dance like a fucking man.

3366
02:37:46,670 --> 02:37:48,370
I Bet Keith Richards has never done a
shelter.

3367
02:37:49,450 --> 02:37:54,450
Don't you think I fake ny that,
but it's freaking brilliant.

3368
02:37:55,280 --> 02:37:56,840
It's brilliant.
I think he hurt his leg.

3369
02:37:56,870 --> 02:37:57,850
I think that's all those.
No,

3370
02:37:57,860 --> 02:37:58,430
no,
no.

3371
02:37:58,430 --> 02:37:59,960
It's just,
just the whole thing.

3372
02:37:59,961 --> 02:38:03,080
They're like,
who talked to her like you want this is

3373
02:38:03,110 --> 02:38:06,590
they're gonna make $50 billion or
whatever.

3374
02:38:06,591 --> 02:38:11,591
They going to $50 billion.
This was the top grossing ever historic.

3375
02:38:15,500 --> 02:38:19,490
You'll will never beat it.
It's how much money.

3376
02:38:19,880 --> 02:38:21,760
Yeah.
We all for capable allowing.

3377
02:38:22,040 --> 02:38:23,930
Wow.
Yeah,

3378
02:38:23,931 --> 02:38:26,030
definitely.
They brought him a fuck load of money.

3379
02:38:26,090 --> 02:38:29,780
That's how they got axle to lay off the
botox and getting the chair.

3380
02:38:31,010 --> 02:38:32,630
Dude,
get a chair for you.

3381
02:38:32,810 --> 02:38:35,750
You gotta fucking got a cast.
Don't worry about it,

3382
02:38:35,751 --> 02:38:36,990
dude.
You're it.

3383
02:38:37,130 --> 02:38:39,080
You hurt your foot.
Of course you can't dance.

3384
02:38:39,390 --> 02:38:40,460
Oink,
oink.

3385
02:38:42,470 --> 02:38:45,830
They probably saw him dance.
He's so fat and fucked up now.

3386
02:38:45,831 --> 02:38:47,810
They probably broke his leg.
They probably came at him with a

3387
02:38:47,811 --> 02:38:50,510
baseball bat.
The promoters like I gotta fucking plan.

3388
02:38:50,740 --> 02:38:51,573
Oh crap,

3389
02:38:53,790 --> 02:38:57,980
you fucking fat junkie.
You get to do this from a chair.

3390
02:38:59,780 --> 02:39:02,390
Put a cast on him.
Put Him in the fucking chair.

3391
02:39:03,250 --> 02:39:04,390
Huh?
Imagine.

3392
02:39:04,450 --> 02:39:07,050
Oh yeah,
they just broke his leg because he was

3393
02:39:07,051 --> 02:39:08,400
so fat.
He showed up.

3394
02:39:08,730 --> 02:39:10,950
He showed up so fat and they got mad.
I come over there.

3395
02:39:10,990 --> 02:39:12,570
It was only one way.
We got to hurt him.

3396
02:39:12,750 --> 02:39:14,070
What?
Why you got to hurt him?

3397
02:39:14,390 --> 02:39:17,610
Cause cause we can't have him fucking
dancing with his gut hanging out.

3398
02:39:17,910 --> 02:39:19,620
We'll just sit him down the fucking
chair.

3399
02:39:20,610 --> 02:39:24,060
Put a cast on him.
Didn't Dave Grohl break his leg while,

3400
02:39:24,090 --> 02:39:25,400
while he's performing?
Yeah,

3401
02:39:25,440 --> 02:39:27,670
I think he and that's his throne.
He was right.

3402
02:39:27,710 --> 02:39:30,120
That was just thrown right?
Yeah because he had like a left leg

3403
02:39:30,150 --> 02:39:33,150
injury.
So actually just borrowed his left leg

3404
02:39:33,180 --> 02:39:34,013
injury chair.

3405
02:39:35,230 --> 02:39:36,063
Wow.

3406
02:39:36,310 --> 02:39:38,680
Or is it a right leg?
It's reversed in bolt images.

3407
02:39:38,920 --> 02:39:41,410
Oh Dave had her right leg injury axolotl
left.

3408
02:39:41,890 --> 02:39:46,630
That's pretty gangster.
Get your fucking foot taped up while he

3409
02:39:46,631 --> 02:39:49,600
did he fall off the stage or something?
Jesus Christ.

3410
02:39:49,601 --> 02:39:51,540
I liked it.
He's a bad motherfucker.

3411
02:39:51,660 --> 02:39:55,780
And Foo fighters are awesome man.
You know like I went through Nirvana.

3412
02:39:56,020 --> 02:39:57,850
I'd like to sit him down and see what he
thinks about that.

3413
02:39:57,851 --> 02:40:00,020
Courtney love documentary.
What's that?

3414
02:40:00,780 --> 02:40:01,780
Talk to someone I think we can.

3415
02:40:04,010 --> 02:40:04,843
Interesting.

3416
02:40:06,160 --> 02:40:09,210
That'd be cool.
What is the Courtney love saying ounces?

3417
02:40:09,220 --> 02:40:12,220
I'm crazy documentary.
That's thinks that courtney love killed

3418
02:40:12,221 --> 02:40:13,560
Kurt cobain.
Have seen that.

3419
02:40:14,640 --> 02:40:17,970
What's it called?
That one is soaked in bleach.

3420
02:40:17,990 --> 02:40:19,130
Yeah.
Yeah,

3421
02:40:19,600 --> 02:40:20,490
it's,
yeah,

3422
02:40:20,640 --> 02:40:23,760
it's got reenactments too.
It's super sweet announcement.

3423
02:40:24,120 --> 02:40:26,910
Yeah,
we're super sketchy whenever you have

3424
02:40:26,911 --> 02:40:28,350
reenactments here.
Like what?

3425
02:40:28,680 --> 02:40:33,680
And the guy was a reenactor is like the
actor from I think thinner from the

3426
02:40:34,591 --> 02:40:38,250
movie thinner with Stephen King and he's
like a semi famous actor with,

3427
02:40:38,251 --> 02:40:41,270
is that who it is?
Because at the same guy it was all on

3428
02:40:41,271 --> 02:40:42,960
the documentary.
Yeah.

3429
02:40:42,961 --> 02:40:46,440
He's,
he plays the cop and the reenactments

3430
02:40:46,441 --> 02:40:48,750
and it's like okay that's the guy who
plays curt.

3431
02:40:48,780 --> 02:40:51,150
But there was a guy who plays the
detective.

3432
02:40:51,990 --> 02:40:53,610
It's a weird documentary cause it's
like,

3433
02:40:53,611 --> 02:40:55,380
man,
you can say anything you want in a

3434
02:40:55,381 --> 02:40:57,510
documentary.
If you use a bunch of reenactments and

3435
02:40:57,511 --> 02:40:59,790
you're pretending that you were there
while this happened.

3436
02:40:59,791 --> 02:41:02,280
But people,
yeah,

3437
02:41:02,460 --> 02:41:04,140
you see my white coat?
Yeah.

3438
02:41:05,460 --> 02:41:07,950
It's a documentary.
It's true.

3439
02:41:07,980 --> 02:41:10,440
If I say documentary,
we have a script.

3440
02:41:10,441 --> 02:41:13,920
We have a story of ARD.
It's reality.

3441
02:41:13,950 --> 02:41:17,220
Which means it's his real,
we're shooting in four k.

3442
02:41:18,960 --> 02:41:20,490
You get to wear the goggles and
everything.

3443
02:41:20,491 --> 02:41:23,070
You'd be positive.
The system that would come out very

3444
02:41:23,071 --> 02:41:24,160
soon.
She don't tell him.

3445
02:41:24,230 --> 02:41:25,850
I'm sorry.

3446
02:41:29,880 --> 02:41:34,300
So we've got to end this and then we're
gonna come back and Jim Brewer is going

3447
02:41:34,301 --> 02:41:36,390
to stay with me as we,
uh,

3448
02:41:36,450 --> 02:41:39,300
we talked to the Great Russell brand.
That will be next.

3449
02:41:39,750 --> 02:41:41,940
We're going to do the Jim and joe show.
It's about time.

3450
02:41:42,300 --> 02:41:44,220
We should done this years ago.
Gel.

3451
02:41:45,150 --> 02:41:46,170
This was cool.
Thank you.

3452
02:41:46,200 --> 02:41:47,880
We're going to keep doing it.
It was cool.

3453
02:41:47,881 --> 02:41:49,230
I'm fucking so happy you're here,
man.

3454
02:41:49,260 --> 02:41:50,470
I'm having a great God.
Damn man.

3455
02:41:50,840 --> 02:41:53,400
We'll be back with Russell brand and a
little bit,

3456
02:41:53,580 --> 02:41:54,413
see as soon.
Yeah,

3457
02:41:57,900 --> 02:41:58,020
that.
