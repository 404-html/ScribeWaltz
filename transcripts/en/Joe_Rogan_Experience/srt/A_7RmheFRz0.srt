1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,100
It had something gotta.
Find something though,

2
00:00:02,101 --> 00:00:03,510
right?
You got to find a struggle.

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,080
It's very important to have a struggle 
to have something you got to accomplish 

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:09,330
because you can already.
Oh Shit.

5
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:12,330
There's a little bit of that.
What's going on,

6
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:16,770
man?
How do I turn the headphones over there?

7
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,410
Which one is it?
Jeremy.

8
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,140
Chuck.
Chuck,

9
00:00:22,141 --> 00:00:22,750
Chuck,
Chuck,

10
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:23,910
Chuck.
Oh,

11
00:00:23,911 --> 00:00:28,911
he's in my ears would live.
It's crazy how we looked at each other 

12
00:00:28,911 --> 00:00:33,791
when we walked in.
I know it is going to embrace what we 

13
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:34,290
did,
man.

14
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:37,580
I want to lean into you.
We added,

15
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,360
Huh?
It's been a long time,

16
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:40,710
man.
Man.

17
00:00:40,711 --> 00:00:42,720
What's up now?
Where do you go now?

18
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:45,030
I don't know.
Just try to stay alive and keep moving.

19
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:46,270
No,
you're doing it.

20
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,980
I remember who's asking you.
You're going to work one day.

21
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,690
Who's asked you just going to put one 
day.

22
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,300
Stand up.
You've called out.

23
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:59,350
Somebody called out a motherfucker.
Just got to get into that.

24
00:01:00,451 --> 00:01:03,150
We get into crates,
crates.

25
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:06,960
It was crazy when when we was doing 
standup,

26
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,050
like it was like.
It was like gunslingers.

27
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,460
What happened with her?
Nothing.

28
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:13,770
You called them out though.
Well,

29
00:01:13,771 --> 00:01:16,500
that was a bad situation.
We had a.

30
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:19,020
He was stealing.
Everybody's bringing up the wrong shit.

31
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:19,490
No,
no,

32
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,030
it's okay.
Okay.

33
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,490
Because I thought it was getting to be 
nice about getting.

34
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:24,080
No,
no,

35
00:01:24,081 --> 00:01:25,570
no.
You got to bring it a wrong.

36
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:30,570
Jamie Foxx,
whatever the terrain.

37
00:01:30,571 --> 00:01:31,800
We were just talking about off,
off,

38
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:32,970
off,
off mic.

39
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,390
About how,
how would we would've been in jail?

40
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:42,000
It had there been social media back when
is coming up.

41
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:43,740
We'd have life.
You have double life.

42
00:01:43,741 --> 00:01:47,430
I'd be looking at you and myself.
Then you had to kill colors when we were

43
00:01:47,431 --> 00:01:51,120
talking about everybody that came up in 
the sixties or seventies.

44
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,200
The eighties,
the nineties.

45
00:01:52,201 --> 00:01:55,590
Everyone before social media though.
Wild lives they lead.

46
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,750
You can't do that anymore.
I can't do it.

47
00:01:57,751 --> 00:02:02,751
And what,
what this comes as you came for all 

48
00:02:02,751 --> 00:02:02,751
y'all just tuning in.
We'll be talking about like,

49
00:02:02,751 --> 00:02:04,230
you know Chris Brown.
I'll see Chris Brown.

50
00:02:04,231 --> 00:02:05,880
He'll come by my house and he'll,
he'll,

51
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:07,740
he'll just sit there and go like,
what the fuck,

52
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:08,580
you know?
And I said,

53
00:02:08,581 --> 00:02:13,581
listen,
you're just too talented for for one 

54
00:02:13,581 --> 00:02:13,581
cats like him and Justin Bieber who've 
been,

55
00:02:13,581 --> 00:02:16,770
who've been blessed with extra.
They look good.

56
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:20,680
They can fight.
They,

57
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:23,790
they're athletic and they sing,
they dance.

58
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:26,040
They could dance.
The first time I met Chris Brown,

59
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:31,041
this is crazy.
I'm throwing a party in Miami and it's 

60
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:35,211
me and call them feral Eddie Murphy.
Eddie Murphy who was still in it this 

61
00:02:35,211 --> 00:02:38,100
year is back to 2005 maybe,
I think.

62
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,600
Yeah,
2005 and a.

63
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,620
So I'm hosting a party in Miami.

64
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
The crowd's going crazy,
but in the down like not in the VIP is 

65
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,520
some kids dancing.
I'm like,

66
00:02:49,521 --> 00:02:51,470
who the fuck ain't dancing,
you know,

67
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,340
and all this shit.
And so my dj,

68
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:54,120
Dj Gary,
he goes,

69
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,380
Yo man,
that's a new kid.

70
00:02:55,381 --> 00:02:56,710
Chris Brown,
Yo,

71
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,230
he bought to be the next one.
I said,

72
00:02:58,231 --> 00:02:59,720
yeah,
but he thinks he dance because you know,

73
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,200
I know how to dance.
I'll go fuck him up.

74
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:03,180
You know what I'm saying?
This young man,

75
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:05,530
I going to know who I am.
I'll come down and fuck him up.

76
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,790
And it was like Fox,
okay,

77
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:09,230
so I'll go down there now,
you know,

78
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:11,890
it's sort of my time.
And so everybody's following me.

79
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:13,990
I'm about to go battle whoever this kid 
is.

80
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:15,670
So I said,
yeah bro,

81
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,490
you think you can dance.
I did like some kind of bullshit.

82
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,820
Listen to me,
we're all,

83
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,670
we're all jammed together,
right?

84
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,680
He doesn't do a move.
You know what he does?

85
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:32,190
He does a back flip.
But the way he did the back flip and 

86
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:34,840
he's six [inaudible] two,
he standing in the middle of the crowd.

87
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:39,841
He jumped over the crowd,
did the back flip up here and came 

88
00:03:39,841 --> 00:03:39,841
straight down and said,
what's up?

89
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:40,590
I said,
motherfucker,

90
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,670
I'm going to leave you the fuck.
Like I don't know what the fuck that,

91
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:47,920
that's some avengers shit.
And I just remember I said that dude,

92
00:03:47,921 --> 00:03:52,921
when he get on and then he gets on,
but then social media catches on and 

93
00:03:52,921 --> 00:03:53,940
then it's just hard.
It's hard.

94
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,720
It's hard.
It's hard to live.

95
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:57,520
Uh,
when you're,

96
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:59,530
when you're social media,
and I tell them all the time,

97
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:04,650
you have this social media sort of makes
you color inside the lines or try to.

98
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,640
I'll try to.
Yeah.

99
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:11,820
Or like this.
It makes you took your artistry and 

100
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:11,890
sometimes a little bit.

101
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,920
Does that make sense?
You're crazy and tuck it crazy and you 

102
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:16,920
tuck your artistry and like,
I didn't know what a mean,

103
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,770
wasn't,
you know,

104
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,750
Shit,
I'm a fucking.

105
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,840
I was just catching on the mindspace and
shit.

106
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:24,730
She shifted.
So My,

107
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,370
my daughter sends me a picture of 
Rihanna,

108
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
right?
Going to the met ball and by the time I 

109
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,280
got the picture,
whatever happened,

110
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:38,960
the picture was Rihanna and in this 
yellow dress and I hit my daughter.

111
00:04:38,961 --> 00:04:41,080
I said,
I love the dress is amazing.

112
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:44,020
I don't understand the pizza that's in 
it,

113
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:45,090
but man,
you know,

114
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,860
maybe that's a,
you know,

115
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:49,930
she's giving a nod to Italy and maybe 
she got the dress for him.

116
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:51,310
And She's like,
no dad,

117
00:04:51,311 --> 00:04:52,960
that's a meme.
I said,

118
00:04:52,961 --> 00:04:55,180
well that's a meme.
I said,

119
00:04:55,181 --> 00:04:55,890
what do you mean?
She says,

120
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:00,900
no,
there's actually not a pizza in the 

121
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:00,900
dress.

122
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,660
Somebody crafted or fixed there,
they made it look like it's pizza 

123
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,280
because Oh,
because it's trailing behind her and so 

124
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:10,280
me,
I'm thinking,

125
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:10,720
well,
what the fuck is the mean?

126
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:15,850
It's just know that that's what I said.
So this girl worked her whole fucking 

127
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:18,850
night to get this dress to go to the met
ball,

128
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:21,340
which is you're supposed to be,
you know,

129
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:25,990
out the box and somebody puts a pizza on
it and that's all you see is a pizza.

130
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,310
I said,
how do you compete with that?

131
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:32,700
How could you be Michael Jordan and kids
run up to you and say you're the cry 

132
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:36,561
baby face man.
That's not a crime in it hasn't been the

133
00:05:37,991 --> 00:05:42,991
best thing on the Internet.
It's one of the best things about the 

134
00:05:42,991 --> 00:05:43,600
ads because being able to make funny.
It's the best thing,

135
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:46,390
but watch this.
So once it sticks,

136
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:48,770
that's what I'm saying.
Once it sticks,

137
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:53,350
sticks Michael Jordan to somebody under 
the age of 18,

138
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,020
he the cry baby face man.
Hey Man.

139
00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:01,710
Hey in.
And then you know how you know how fans 

140
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:01,710
do.
Men Cry Right quick.

141
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,090
Let me get you cry.
It's so true.

142
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,150
Yeah,
man,

143
00:06:08,151 --> 00:06:09,520
it's so stuff.
Well,

144
00:06:09,521 --> 00:06:13,360
we were talking about Jon Jones.
Jon Jones fight this weekend.

145
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:18,650
John Jones is a wild motherfucker and 
that's why he's the greatest light 

146
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:20,030
heavyweight of all time because he's.
So.

147
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,850
It's part of what you have to have it.
We've talking about.

148
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:26,390
Go be with Mike Tyson,
Mike Tyson,

149
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,220
back in the day.
You couldn't.

150
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:31,130
That's why when people say like,
why does Mike Tyson,

151
00:06:31,131 --> 00:06:32,150
he first of all,
he's a fighter.

152
00:06:32,151 --> 00:06:37,151
He's not a tennis player,
but Mike was a wild boy and to hang out 

153
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:42,431
with him you could understand like he 
was the biggest person on the planet and

154
00:06:44,481 --> 00:06:46,070
he had the demons,
you know what I'm saying?

155
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:48,020
And.
But he's fun too because because you see

156
00:06:48,021 --> 00:06:50,120
them in a club and he sees,
he sees some girls.

157
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:54,210
How you doing?
You like bmws and girls?

158
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:55,110
Like what do you like?

159
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,270
BMW,
like cars,

160
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:01,360
like bmws and crazy.
He'd take the girls out and go get a 

161
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,270
BMW.
I mean he was at crazy.

162
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:03,660
You know what I'm saying?
C'Mon,

163
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:04,610
c'mon.
Let's look at the bar.

164
00:07:04,611 --> 00:07:07,730
And we open up the BMW dealership.
But he was wild,

165
00:07:07,731 --> 00:07:09,760
but I say just like,
how are we saying here?

166
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:15,250
You can't have that type of talent in 
that area and not have this.

167
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,490
Jon Jones can't.
You can't.

168
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:22,010
You can't drink milk and it almost 
killed somebody.

169
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,050
You know what I'm saying?
You can't.

170
00:07:24,051 --> 00:07:26,330
You don't let me get that homogenized.
No,

171
00:07:26,331 --> 00:07:27,110
you can't.
Yeah.

172
00:07:27,111 --> 00:07:30,170
There's gotta be something about you.
The tighter control and impulsive,

173
00:07:30,171 --> 00:07:31,460
wild,
dangerous,

174
00:07:31,461 --> 00:07:33,710
and that's what makes him so great.
Everybody.

175
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,570
You even talked about,
even looking at people on your wall,

176
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,520
you look at Hendrix,
you look at Elvis,

177
00:07:37,521 --> 00:07:40,850
they have to have something because 
that's God fucking lose.

178
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:43,400
God's going to give you something 
incredible,

179
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:48,910
but he's also going to give you 
something to anchor that because I 

180
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:49,490
believe this is what I believe in and 
you tell me if you believe this.

181
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,830
I believe in the yen and the Yang of 
everything.

182
00:07:51,831 --> 00:07:56,831
Meaning like when there's absolute light
that has to be absolute darkness to 

183
00:07:56,831 --> 00:07:58,820
balance it out.
And that's what everything that we do.

184
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:04,150
It's sorta like we're not gonna.
Get Away with anything like anything 

185
00:08:04,671 --> 00:08:07,670
that happens to you in life.
You have to pay for it,

186
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,710
like it's like the grocery store.
Okay.

187
00:08:09,711 --> 00:08:11,690
I got the career,
got gotta pay for that.

188
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:12,680
Okay.
I got the money.

189
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,460
Boom.
Okay,

190
00:08:13,461 --> 00:08:15,830
I got to pay for that.
Then here come the family boot.

191
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,730
Yeah,
I need that money.

192
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,100
You fucking way.
I'm going,

193
00:08:19,101 --> 00:08:21,200
I'm going.
I'm a real release the story about you.

194
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:26,320
So it's all of these different things 
that you got to pay for and that's why 

195
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:26,320
you see these guys like that.

196
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,940
Because like I said,
talking to Justin Bieber,

197
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:29,870
you know,
with everything I said,

198
00:08:29,871 --> 00:08:31,970
some of this shit is supposed to happen 
to you.

199
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:34,010
It has to.
He can't otherwise.

200
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:36,470
The think of the success that kids had 
at 20 years old.

201
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:41,740
It's impossible.
I was just reading some shit about him 

202
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:41,810
canceling his tour because he just said 
too much work.

203
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:45,730
I mean he's just going crazy I guess,
but he's made $93,000,000

204
00:08:45,731 --> 00:08:49,400
is here like Jesus Christ fucking 20.
Yeah.

205
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,400
And for us we like shit because you 
know,

206
00:08:52,401 --> 00:08:55,040
I ain't fuck,
I'm going to take that $90 million.

207
00:08:55,050 --> 00:09:00,050
I'm going to go do a million,
but we can't be in his mind and we can 

208
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:01,620
see how it is he grew up that way.
He grew up that way.

209
00:09:01,621 --> 00:09:05,400
Never had a normal life and you don't 
expect like I,

210
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:10,410
I,
like I always tell kids who want to be 

211
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:10,410
in this business to please wait.

212
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:11,610
Like even with my kids,
just wait,

213
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:16,700
wait until you're like,
wait you to understand like I was able 

214
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,131
to be grown and and have some grown shit
happened to me and just regular life 

215
00:09:19,131 --> 00:09:20,130
should happen.
So then when this happened,

216
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:24,720
I still have a point of reference to get
back to because you know,

217
00:09:24,721 --> 00:09:26,400
like I know you've interviewed 
everybody.

218
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:31,920
This business affects you in such a way 
where you see one person one day,

219
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:37,280
I won't say the comedian's name,
but I remember a comedian back in the 

220
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,870
day did like half of an hbo or whatever,
and then the next week I saw him.

221
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:43,170
He had 12 body guards and they were 
pushing me back.

222
00:09:43,171 --> 00:09:44,960
Then I was like,
what the fuck man?

223
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:45,810
Yo Man,
Yo now,

224
00:09:45,811 --> 00:09:50,811
right now it just got crazy.
It got crazy and so they get crazy cars 

225
00:09:50,811 --> 00:09:52,950
and I see I out,
I won't say the names,

226
00:09:52,951 --> 00:09:57,951
but there've been a couple of guys I 
never get this one dude hit and I went 

227
00:09:57,951 --> 00:10:02,781
up to try to say something to him and 
and for some reason he had a white suit 

228
00:10:02,781 --> 00:10:03,640
on.
We went to a club,

229
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:09,030
fuck this.
He had this white suit on and he's big 

230
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:09,030
shades and I went to talk to him and he 
said,

231
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:09,960
not right now,
man,

232
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:10,800
I'm rich.

233
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:15,980
He said that to everybody right now.
They got rich.

234
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:20,780
Let me be rich and famous right now.
I don't want to hear your pitch,

235
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,010
Jim,

236
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:24,530
something you think you could get away.
And I was like,

237
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,160
as he said it,
I had to sort of like,

238
00:10:27,161 --> 00:10:28,500
okay,
I get that.

239
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:29,710
But that's,
you know,

240
00:10:29,711 --> 00:10:34,711
that's what happens when you got to be 
careful that tide goes in and it goes 

241
00:10:34,711 --> 00:10:36,160
out and people come up and they 
remember.

242
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:41,460
They remember and remember when you 
fucked with them and we've seen and 

243
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:41,460
we've seen them,
we've seen them,

244
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,310
but,
but being a comedian,

245
00:10:42,311 --> 00:10:47,311
we get,
we get a chance to sit in a different 

246
00:10:47,311 --> 00:10:50,161
seat because we sort of are our jobs or 
our observational,

247
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,170
you know what I'm saying?
We still have our own demons,

248
00:10:53,171 --> 00:10:54,430
but it's.
It's just different.

249
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:56,710
You also get humbled a lot as a 
comedian.

250
00:10:56,711 --> 00:10:58,210
Yeah.
You got to get those jokes.

251
00:10:58,211 --> 00:11:00,100
You're performing in front of a live 
audience.

252
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,040
It's all live.
It's gotta work and it doesn't work.

253
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:03,410
Shit.

254
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,910
You got to go back to the drawing board 
and it's got to assess.

255
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:12,030
Actors don't get a lot of that.
That's one of the reasons why they're 

256
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:12,030
kind of shaky.
More shaky.

257
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:12,030
Yeah,
right.

258
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:15,160
Don't get a lot of that testing it live 
in front of people.

259
00:11:15,161 --> 00:11:17,490
That humility that comes with that you 
don't and and it's in.

260
00:11:17,491 --> 00:11:18,790
It's tough.
I was talking to her act,

261
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:20,710
another actor,
and it's tough because see,

262
00:11:20,711 --> 00:11:23,680
I'm a comic who became an actor,
so I'm cheating.

263
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:26,110
You know what I'm saying?
I can go do this and I can go.

264
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,230
I'm going to be in St Louis tomorrow,
you know some jokes so I can,

265
00:11:29,231 --> 00:11:29,900
you know,
I gotta get.

266
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,020
I can get my thing off.
But just actors,

267
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,160
it's tough when you figured out a way to
balance three careers,

268
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:39,040
you can sing too.
I mean you could do anything.

269
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:40,870
You're a weird guy in that way.

270
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:45,870
You got a lot of weird talent yourself.
He's talking about Justin Bieber and 

271
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:49,950
Chris Brown.
You've got some weird ability to shift 

272
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:50,360
to it.
Not only him,

273
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:54,340
but I've been fortunate in the fact that
now things have up like,

274
00:11:54,341 --> 00:11:55,480
you know,
back in the day,

275
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:58,510
like you could only do one thing.
One thing I will never forget,

276
00:11:58,511 --> 00:12:00,070
Keenan Ivory Wayans told me,
he said,

277
00:12:00,071 --> 00:12:01,930
Yo,
what's with the singing shit?

278
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:08,440
You motherfucker,
I can't see you trying to sing and shit 

279
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,670
or I would try to sing.
Can you see them?

280
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,070
No,
this is real.

281
00:12:12,071 --> 00:12:13,150
And grow back.
Oh Jamie,

282
00:12:13,151 --> 00:12:14,920
stop youtube.
Funny in the face.

283
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:18,490
Face is too funny.
I see one is singing to me.

284
00:12:18,491 --> 00:12:22,060
You finally stopped.
So I was like,

285
00:12:22,061 --> 00:12:23,050
fuck,
maybe I never seen.

286
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,790
You know.
So I was doing,

287
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:26,970
of course the stand up,
you know,

288
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:31,980
doing the one the shit and then it 
wasn't until literally I was throwing 

289
00:12:32,591 --> 00:12:37,591
these parties at my crib and I would 
always throw parties for like musical 

290
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:37,591
guys,
you know,

291
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:41,500
so I threw a party for puff,
puff comes and big party,

292
00:12:41,501 --> 00:12:46,501
it's like 2000 puffers there and it's 
all about him and I'll never forget he 

293
00:12:46,501 --> 00:12:48,360
got mad at me a little bit because I 
would follow him and I would,

294
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:50,260
I would actually follow him with,
with a,

295
00:12:50,261 --> 00:12:53,800
with a camera because at that time,
at that time Paul was the biggest guy in

296
00:12:53,801 --> 00:12:54,460
the world,
you know,

297
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:55,630
you couldn't even get in this party.

298
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:58,030
So the way we're getting this party,
I show up with a camera,

299
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,370
like your pump,
you need to document,

300
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,290
document the shit can turn around.
What's up playboy?

301
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:02,650
I said,
yeah,

302
00:13:02,651 --> 00:13:04,110
let me get that.
Ain't nobody getting this and that.

303
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,790
And it wasn't back in the day with,
you know,

304
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:10,910
with the camera phone,
I had the big fucking cannon that you 

305
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:10,910
put on your shoulder and the light and 
the shit.

306
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:11,770
I said,
let me change the battery,

307
00:13:11,771 --> 00:13:12,700
let me get all this shit.
Right.

308
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:18,430
So at one point I told him we were 
actually in Philly and he was throwing a

309
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:19,210
party and he said,
Yo,

310
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:24,230
playboy,
this party is a million and a half 

311
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:24,230
dollars.
I said,

312
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:27,000
like,
he said,

313
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,680
it costs a million and a half dollars to
throw this party.

314
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:30,670
I said,
Oh my God,

315
00:13:30,671 --> 00:13:31,990
I love it.
The party is amazing.

316
00:13:31,991 --> 00:13:33,310
Yes,
the mayor is here and everything.

317
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:34,570
I said,
but that's too much money.

318
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,430
I said,
you come to my place in La,

319
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:41,130
I'll throw you a party for $400 bucks 
that will rival this party.

320
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,540
And he got a little mad because,
you know,

321
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,470
he was like,
Yo know I'm known for this shit.

322
00:13:44,471 --> 00:13:45,440
Don't front.
I said,

323
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:46,750
I'm not,
I respect you.

324
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:47,990
I said,
but la,

325
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:53,190
I just know how to get around.
So he gets to La and he calls me early 

326
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:55,150
in the morning,
you'll play but make that shit happens,

327
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:55,690
etc.
I said,

328
00:13:55,691 --> 00:13:58,540
cool.
I'll go in on my phones and by 12:00

329
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:01,870
at my small house in tarzana and god 
bless my neighbors that lived there.

330
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:06,930
I'm no longer there.
I know they wanted me to get out of it 

331
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:08,851
because that was too much.
But the parties fevered pitch and I 

332
00:14:08,851 --> 00:14:11,881
invited the right people,
you know the right girls were beautiful 

333
00:14:11,881 --> 00:14:11,881
but not too tight.

334
00:14:11,881 --> 00:14:11,881
Not too,
you know,

335
00:14:11,881 --> 00:14:15,240
just everything was great.
The guys wouldn't know haters because la

336
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,390
could man,
fuck them,

337
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,480
fuck them because no one in that it was 
the right guys and he shows up and when 

338
00:14:22,451 --> 00:14:23,410
he shows up,
he goes,

339
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:25,480
that's the girl on that tv show.
Oh,

340
00:14:25,481 --> 00:14:26,500
that's the gIrl in the movie.
I said,

341
00:14:26,501 --> 00:14:27,280
yeah,
you're with friends.

342
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:29,500
It's like we were all hanging out here.
So it's like,

343
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:31,810
you know,
it's all good and that's the cookie.

344
00:14:31,811 --> 00:14:32,110
I said,
yeah,

345
00:14:32,111 --> 00:14:32,800
yeah.
I said,

346
00:14:32,801 --> 00:14:33,730
but look at the party.
I said,

347
00:14:33,731 --> 00:14:35,980
look over there on the table.
I got Kentucky fried chicken,

348
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:40,060
but I put it into a nice plates.
I got coca cola,

349
00:14:40,061 --> 00:14:41,740
but it's just in a picture.
I said,

350
00:14:41,741 --> 00:14:45,450
we're at 280 bucks right now and 
counting I won't go 400.

351
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,320
And he had the most incredible time.
Right?

352
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:52,340
But at that party was on musical people 
and I did it for reason at that party.

353
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:53,360
Missy elliot,
of course,

354
00:14:53,361 --> 00:14:58,361
she had her room.
Everybody's going crazy with missy 

355
00:14:58,361 --> 00:14:59,090
elliot.
I'm going into my garage and there's two

356
00:14:59,091 --> 00:15:01,430
guys,
a little guy like this and a tall guy.

357
00:15:01,431 --> 00:15:02,770
The little guy goes,
yo,

358
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,760
yo,
it's like this all the time,

359
00:15:04,761 --> 00:15:05,580
be.
I said,

360
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:06,110
yeah,
who are you?

361
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,150
He said,
oh,

362
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,320
we didn't have to.
My name is fred.

363
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:09,860
I said,
yeah man,

364
00:15:09,861 --> 00:15:11,240
I heard you.
That's how long ago this was.

365
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,360
Wow.
So he's like,

366
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:15,060
can I just go and have a great time?
Uh,

367
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,610
there was another guy standing on the 
wall,

368
00:15:16,611 --> 00:15:19,670
green jacket,
like a green little jumpsuit.

369
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:24,320
Nobody's talking to him.
Guess who was who?

370
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,750
Jay z.
Nobody

371
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,280
knew.
I said,

372
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:28,890
what's up man?
Great party.

373
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:35,810
So crazy.
No one knows.

374
00:15:35,811 --> 00:15:39,110
But,
and now the way I got into the music,

375
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:44,200
however,
is that all these different parties was 

376
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,391
going on and I would have like different
musical people leave me music in my 

377
00:15:46,391 --> 00:15:51,191
little studio that I built.
I went and got this great studio built 

378
00:15:51,191 --> 00:15:54,071
in the back of my house.
and so one day incomes as kid backpack 

379
00:15:54,071 --> 00:15:56,780
on jaws busted.
Who is it?

380
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:59,780
Who kanye.
Oh,

381
00:15:59,781 --> 00:16:01,700
his jaw was busted from my car accident,
right.

382
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,710
Kanye and walks in and I said,
who's that?

383
00:16:03,711 --> 00:16:04,000
They said,
well,

384
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,630
that said,
new motherfuck kanye man.

385
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,580
He bout to beat the shit.
I said,

386
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,280
what do you do?
Well,

387
00:16:07,281 --> 00:16:08,690
he produced,
but he also wraps.

388
00:16:08,691 --> 00:16:08,980
I said,
well,

389
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,730
anybody come to my house?
They got to perform.

390
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,170
So I said,
yo man.

391
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:12,980
They say,
you know,

392
00:16:12,981 --> 00:16:15,010
you wrap it.
He wrapped the most incredible free.

393
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,220
I don't know if it was free.
It was incorrect.

394
00:16:16,221 --> 00:16:18,020
I said,
I don't know why you aren't famous.

395
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,600
He did it with a broken jaw.
He had a little little jobs,

396
00:16:20,601 --> 00:16:22,700
a little swollen.
I don't think it was broken,

397
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,870
but it was a little swollen because it 
wasn't too long after that accident that

398
00:16:26,871 --> 00:16:27,540
he had.
Right.

399
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,970
And then he goes,
ah,

400
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:29,810
I,
I,

401
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:33,190
I got a song that dad,
you will,

402
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:38,180
you will be good on a song.
I know you could kill it.

403
00:16:38,181 --> 00:16:38,630
I was like,
man,

404
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:39,580
so

405
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:40,700
goofy face

406
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:44,910
from a living calisa yeah.
I said,

407
00:16:44,911 --> 00:16:45,640
oh shit.
Cool.

408
00:16:45,641 --> 00:16:50,641
So we go in the back.
One of the students got studio in the 

409
00:16:50,641 --> 00:16:50,641
bag.
So he sings.

410
00:16:50,641 --> 00:16:50,641
He says,
the song's going to go.

411
00:16:50,641 --> 00:16:54,130
She say she wants some marvin gaye,
some luther vandross.

412
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:55,030
So I said,
I got it.

413
00:16:56,470 --> 00:17:00,610
She said she wants a mom being good.
He's like,

414
00:17:00,611 --> 00:17:02,050
what are you doing?
I said,

415
00:17:02,051 --> 00:17:02,630
well,
I got to put them,

416
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,640
you know,
the r and b on it,

417
00:17:03,641 --> 00:17:04,990
you know what I'm saying?
I'm a real singer,

418
00:17:04,991 --> 00:17:05,850
you know,
I've been seeing it.

419
00:17:05,851 --> 00:17:07,330
He said,
don't do that.

420
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:14,870
Just just sing the song because it's hip
hop.

421
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:15,590
And I said,
okay,

422
00:17:15,591 --> 00:17:17,210
cool.
So I begrudgingly sung a song.

423
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,230
I'm thinking songs whack.
He's not gonna make it.

424
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:23,390
So I went off,
I did a bad movie.

425
00:17:23,391 --> 00:17:25,790
I come back about six weeks,
eight weeks later,

426
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:29,300
that song is number one.
My boy goes like,

427
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:32,720
you remember that song you said wasn't 
shit is number one in the country,

428
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,790
and then that's how I got into the 
music.

429
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:37,310
So long story longer.
It's like,

430
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,800
yeah,
you can do all of the things and there's

431
00:17:39,801 --> 00:17:43,700
a lot of actors and actresses that can.
You just need those opportunities.

432
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:46,790
Just like in life when your.
When your opportunity comes,

433
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:50,850
if you prepare for it now could jump 
into it and grab it.

434
00:17:50,851 --> 00:17:55,830
And what I was told was by my guy 
brianne who does all of my music,

435
00:17:55,831 --> 00:17:59,670
he found slow jams.
He found a goal that you found,

436
00:17:59,671 --> 00:18:04,671
blame it on the alcohol.
He says you got to stop singing funny 

437
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:08,001
shit and seeing a real record and once 
you sing the real record and not say 

438
00:18:08,001 --> 00:18:09,180
it's you singing it,
now you got a better goal.

439
00:18:09,181 --> 00:18:11,670
So now after all of those years,

440
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:18,190
the people that grew up with me was 
doing standup or watch a date.

441
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:21,170
They're older and they're a young folks 
is like

442
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:25,630
you'd kanye man,
just like how,

443
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,820
you know the guys now going into 
michael,

444
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,950
so,
so as I get older,

445
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,110
you hope that you're blessed with 
opportunities and you know,

446
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:39,160
the old saying,
but to sort of reinvent or reintroduce 

447
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:39,160
yourself to people who may not know who 
you are,

448
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:41,980
what's also guys like you have other 
interests.

449
00:18:41,981 --> 00:18:44,530
You have more than one interest.
You don't just want to be funny.

450
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:46,720
Yeah,
there's a lot going on in there.

451
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:47,620
It's,
it's a lot,

452
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,680
you know,
but like,

453
00:18:48,681 --> 00:18:51,790
like we all are like comedians.
We got a lot of shit that we want to get

454
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:54,580
out.
And like I said,

455
00:18:54,581 --> 00:18:55,900
being a comedian,
we had,

456
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,100
we,
we used to have.

457
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,660
It's getting,
it's getting crazier.

458
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:01,660
It's getting tough on us as far as you 
know,

459
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,330
everything we say,
you know,

460
00:19:04,331 --> 00:19:07,380
they want to come kill us.
I mean,

461
00:19:07,381 --> 00:19:08,500
I did,
I did one,

462
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:13,590
I did jimmy fallon,
one seedinG the jimmy fallon in every 

463
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:16,300
organization want to get me.
What did you say?

464
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,680
I was doing a joke,
uh,

465
00:19:19,681 --> 00:19:24,681
of singing.
We were singing these funny songs about 

466
00:19:24,681 --> 00:19:27,520
who let the dogs out and so we took who 
let the dogs out and put it in like a,

467
00:19:27,521 --> 00:19:28,380
um,
like a,

468
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:32,310
like a vaudeville or show tune who let 
the dogs or whatever it was.

469
00:19:32,311 --> 00:19:35,130
Right.
But beginning of that I saw that ad lib,

470
00:19:35,131 --> 00:19:40,131
like I was watching these dogs and they 
were coming towards me and I was 

471
00:19:40,131 --> 00:19:40,320
wondering,
you know,

472
00:19:40,321 --> 00:19:42,750
who let them out and there was a pit 
bull there and you know,

473
00:19:42,751 --> 00:19:45,560
you have to be careful because pit bulls
can be contentious,

474
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:47,070
you know.
And then I go into the song,

475
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:51,120
the pit bull community.
I was like jamie foxx,

476
00:19:51,121 --> 00:19:56,121
session people shameless.
And then there was another thing where 

477
00:19:57,651 --> 00:20:02,390
jimmy fallon was doing,
was doing some type of,

478
00:20:02,391 --> 00:20:07,391
uh,
he was saying what was going to be on 

479
00:20:07,391 --> 00:20:10,361
the next show.
And I was doing a bad version of 

480
00:20:10,361 --> 00:20:14,770
signing,
which I actually know how to sign if I 

481
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:14,770
was doing a bad version of sign 
language.

482
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:16,640
I know we'll talk more about it later,
you know,

483
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:20,600
all those types of different things.
But as I was doing it as a joke,

484
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:23,870
I didn't know that the person that he 
was talking about happened to be deaf.

485
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:27,430
Oh no.
Oh my god.

486
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:28,900
And so then,
you know,

487
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,720
so it was just all of these things.
And I try to tell people,

488
00:20:31,721 --> 00:20:32,080
I said,
hey,

489
00:20:32,081 --> 00:20:34,210
listen,
we never mean anything bad.

490
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:36,400
We poke fun,
but we're not.

491
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:37,960
We don't mean anythIng bad,
but you can't just,

492
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:40,120
you can't,
you can't kill us.

493
00:20:40,121 --> 00:20:45,121
I.
And because I got to keep doing what I 

494
00:20:45,121 --> 00:20:45,121
do,
you know?

495
00:20:45,121 --> 00:20:45,121
So it's,
it's getting tougher.

496
00:20:45,121 --> 00:20:46,560
Well,
it's just what we're talking about,

497
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,160
social,
about people

498
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,120
commenting on things that you can't read
the comments.

499
00:20:50,121 --> 00:20:55,121
There's just too many people and people 
are always looking for something to be 

500
00:20:55,121 --> 00:20:58,681
recreationally outraged at in the 
comments and get that ass through the 

501
00:20:58,681 --> 00:21:02,010
comment,
comment and hit you right where you go 

502
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:02,010
sometimes because damn,
this motherfucker's right.

503
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:04,180
It's good to though a little bit.
You went there right?

504
00:21:04,181 --> 00:21:09,181
When they're actually right.
Like someone can say something 

505
00:21:09,181 --> 00:21:09,181
ridiculous about you and if you know 
it's ridiculous,

506
00:21:09,181 --> 00:21:11,220
it doesn't mean anything,
but if it's got a hint of truth.

507
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,580
But when somebody says something about 
your teeth,

508
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,590
you,
you kind of look in the mirror.

509
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,340
I don't understand,
man.

510
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,290
I got like,
I'm fucked up.

511
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I got.
But I got somebody hit me with the 

512
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,000
donkey,
yo fucking donkey.

513
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I was like,
ah,

514
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,720
yeah.
So,

515
00:21:27,721 --> 00:21:29,130
you know.
But I tell people all the time,

516
00:21:29,131 --> 00:21:31,470
don't read the comments.
That's the book comments,

517
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,830
because it will make you start to change
the way you do things.

518
00:21:34,831 --> 00:21:37,170
If I read all the comments,
I never tell another joke.

519
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,180
Yeah,
if I read all the comments,

520
00:21:39,181 --> 00:21:40,680
I'll never try another,
you know,

521
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:45,710
the,
I got a movie that we just a shot for 

522
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:45,710
little or nothing called all star 
weekend.

523
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:47,580
And the jokes are like all the way out 
there,

524
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,800
you know,
and it's,

525
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,460
I got everybody in it,
you know,

526
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:53,190
and we're all taking.
We all play different characters.

527
00:21:53,191 --> 00:21:56,220
Like I play a white racist,
white racist cop.

528
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,430
And how do you do that?

529
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,830
I'll show it to you.
I'll grab,

530
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:04,310
I'll grab this thing and show it to you.
But it's a robert downey jr.

531
00:22:04,311 --> 00:22:09,311
He plays a mexican,
a gerard butler plays a russian who 

532
00:22:09,311 --> 00:22:09,311
loves gymnastics.
Uh,

533
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:12,260
benicia del toro plays is crazy tattoo 
artist and we're all,

534
00:22:12,261 --> 00:22:13,880
you know,
we're all doing our thing.

535
00:22:13,881 --> 00:22:17,030
So it's like if you read the comments 
that'll make you tuck that in,

536
00:22:17,031 --> 00:22:19,000
but this is some brilliant and,
and it's,

537
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,320
it's,
it's a cool little thing to it.

538
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,180
It's called a all star weekend for a 
reason.

539
00:22:23,181 --> 00:22:25,100
It's about two guys.
One guy loves steph curry,

540
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:30,490
the other guy loves lebron james and all
they're trying to do is get to the all 

541
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:33,371
star game and it's sorta like this whole
journey of running into all these 

542
00:22:33,371 --> 00:22:33,371
people.
So it's dope,

543
00:22:33,371 --> 00:22:33,950
but it has some things where it's like,
ooh,

544
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:36,290
you know,
you can see there's going to be some,

545
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,160
some shit going on.

546
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,710
But robert downey jr,
just from tropic thunder,

547
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:41,660
think about that.
You could never do that anymore.

548
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:45,740
You can't blackface anymore.
You know what I'll say this,

549
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,680
people have to understand where it comes
from.

550
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:53,300
There are real people that did it really
mean you harm like outside of us.

551
00:22:53,301 --> 00:22:55,380
I mean there's some real people who 
really don't fucking like you.

552
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:57,170
Whatever you are,
whether you're black,

553
00:22:57,171 --> 00:22:58,670
you're white,
you're straight,

554
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:59,600
gay,
whatever it is.

555
00:22:59,601 --> 00:23:03,800
There's some people who really don't 
with the entertainment and it's easy.

556
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,870
We're easy.
Targets were easy.

557
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:09,530
It's easy for you to jump on.
Robert downey jr or jamie five.

558
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:12,650
So joe,
because it's easy,

559
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:14,630
you know,
when it's real things,

560
00:23:14,631 --> 00:23:19,631
which you know,
whether it's politics or whether it's 

561
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:19,631
whatever.
A lot of times we,

562
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:21,140
we sorta,
we're not ready for that fight,

563
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:23,390
but it's easy to sort of pick the 
comedian.

564
00:23:23,391 --> 00:23:24,290
I called robert,
I said,

565
00:23:24,291 --> 00:23:25,910
listen,
I need you to play a mexican.

566
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,830
He says,
dude,

567
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,190
here's the deal.
Sure.

568
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:30,190
Why not?
Fuck it.

569
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,000
Sure.
Of course you're mexican,

570
00:23:32,001 --> 00:23:34,430
whatever.
But then he texts back and said,

571
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:39,620
I'm nervous to play the mexican.
I said,

572
00:23:39,621 --> 00:23:42,410
well shit,
you played the black dude and you killed

573
00:23:42,411 --> 00:23:44,120
that shit.
Which just all,

574
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,910
you know,
we to be able to do character.

575
00:23:45,911 --> 00:23:48,050
What kind of blow back did he get from 
playing the black dude?

576
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:54,460
None.
Because we finished before the wire too 

577
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:54,460
though.
it was like,

578
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,540
what year is tropic thunder?
I feel like that was like 10 years ago.

579
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:57,770
It was awhile.
But,

580
00:23:57,771 --> 00:23:58,700
but,
but here's the thing,

581
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:01,640
we fuck with robert downey jr.
Like that's our guy.

582
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:07,070
Like I did his birthday party and my 
first joke was how dare you take all of 

583
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,460
these roles from black people,
you know?

584
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:09,740
Anyway,
everybody's laughing.

585
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:12,920
So it sorta liked to entertain as man,
we,

586
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,750
we got to give us room.

587
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:16,430
You know what I'm saying?
Like to play any.

588
00:24:16,431 --> 00:24:18,770
I'll show you when I got to take that 
room.

589
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:21,130
You gotta take it.
You can't worry about.

590
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:22,970
I started chappelle somewhere.
It was like,

591
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:28,060
you know,
they would ask him about his jokes and 

592
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:28,060
he was like,
yo man,

593
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:28,060
look,
you know,

594
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:31,660
people have said worse shit.
And I think it said something about 

595
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:31,660
Donald Trump saying grab by the pussy or
some shit,

596
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:32,450
whatever.
But it was true.

597
00:24:32,451 --> 00:24:37,451
It was like the oNe thing that you look 
at what happened with politics this 

598
00:24:37,451 --> 00:24:42,430
year,
people sort of stripped away a lot of 

599
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:42,430
things.
You know what I'm saying?

600
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:45,641
Regardless of what you believed in a 
whatever person you voted for.

601
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:52,310
It was a lot of things that were sort of
addressed about like maybe we're playing

602
00:24:52,311 --> 00:24:57,311
things a little too close,
like some of those politicians were 

603
00:24:57,311 --> 00:25:00,581
afraid to say what Donald Trump was 
saying and they ended up being left in 

604
00:25:00,581 --> 00:25:01,670
the dust because people were like,
well,

605
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:06,850
he's,
he's got a point in the sense of we're 

606
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:06,850
playing things a little too close.

607
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:06,850
So,
uh,

608
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:08,600
when you look at that as a comedian,
it's like,

609
00:25:08,601 --> 00:25:09,710
wow,
that was,

610
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:15,040
that was good for me.
And it was good for me in a certain way 

611
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:15,040
of.
First of all,

612
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:15,700
it is great jokes too.
It's like,

613
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:20,770
it does say,
are we becoming too fragile when it 

614
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:22,940
comes to our race?
Like black folk?

615
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:23,860
Like I said,
yeah,

616
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:27,680
some people are racist and some people 
are perceptionist know what that means.

617
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:32,090
Know the perception is the perception in
America was the white man.

618
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:35,540
Donald trump can be president.
The woman can't do it.

619
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:40,160
Perception doesn't mean that if you vote
for Donald Trump that you're racist.

620
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:41,990
I don't think everybody's here because 
that was a big thing.

621
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,840
Sometimes this perception I'll,
I'll make,

622
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:48,230
I'll make it clear.
I do a joke in front of all black people

623
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:51,710
and I said,
black people are very interesting people

624
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:54,970
because we deal with racism and 
perception ism.

625
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,870
I said,
because we're very nervous.

626
00:25:56,871 --> 00:25:58,280
Flyers,
right?

627
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:03,340
We don't like to get home planes.
First thing we do when we get on the 

628
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:03,340
plane,
we see who's flying this motherfucker.

629
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:05,090
We look in The cockpit.
If we look and see a black guy,

630
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:07,520
we will stop and go,
hey,

631
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,870
how long have you been flying?
But uh,

632
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:17,270
you got your hours with you.
And that was the perception and don't 

633
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:18,020
let a woman sitting next to him.
Oh shit we good.

634
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:21,610
It could be a bright sunny day.
Is that how's the weather?

635
00:26:21,611 --> 00:26:23,690
Or we're good.
And then as you're sitting in that seat,

636
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,570
anytime you hit a bump bump,
my brother,

637
00:26:26,571 --> 00:26:29,780
we straight,
same situation.

638
00:26:29,781 --> 00:26:34,781
You go in the cockpit,
you see that white guy with that salt 

639
00:26:34,781 --> 00:26:37,691
and pepper hair and those aviators and 
it's forum hair like this and it's 

640
00:26:37,691 --> 00:26:39,950
storming outside.
Shit fly the shit through a hurricane.

641
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:44,630
So it's the perception that we have to 
talk about some time.

642
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:45,820
Does that make sense?
Oh,

643
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,330
it definitely makes sense.
Yeah.

644
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:52,370
You know,
there's definitely that you don't like 

645
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:52,370
the Donald Trump thinks funny.
Know who had it,

646
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:53,520
said it best.
Alonzo bowden,

647
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:54,150
you know,
alonzo.

648
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:57,480
No funny comedian,
he said he goes,

649
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:00,630
not all Donald Trump supporters are 
racist,

650
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:03,030
but aLl racists are Donald Trump 
supporters.

651
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:10,990
That he definitely awakened that side.
But I repeat,

652
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,900
I will,
but I will say this,

653
00:27:12,901 --> 00:27:17,901
like I said,
the perception gets us all to know 

654
00:27:17,901 --> 00:27:17,901
because like my daughter,
it was interested in my oldest,

655
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:19,680
my oldest daughter,
like when,

656
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:20,700
when the,
uh,

657
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:23,800
when the election happened and when you 
know,

658
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,210
the results came in,
dan,

659
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,300
I'm so mad I can't take it.
I said,

660
00:27:27,301 --> 00:27:27,640
well,
what,

661
00:27:27,641 --> 00:27:29,010
you were going to go march.
I said,

662
00:27:29,011 --> 00:27:30,810
what did you all vote?
Not all of us,

663
00:27:30,811 --> 00:27:31,980
but you know,
I said,

664
00:27:31,981 --> 00:27:32,970
well,
you know,

665
00:27:32,971 --> 00:27:36,270
you gotta get out there because their 
perception was she had it in the bag.

666
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,490
You know what I'm saying?
So you gotta get out there and be,

667
00:27:38,491 --> 00:27:39,660
you know,
whatever that is.

668
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:41,160
Yeah.
Whatever that is.

669
00:27:41,161 --> 00:27:43,620
Indeed.
This is a weird times for everybody,

670
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,870
you know,
because I think social media is allowing

671
00:27:45,871 --> 00:27:47,180
people to express themselves.

672
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:50,670
Everybody's expressed themselves and 
perform them forming groups,

673
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,210
you know,
they're just like,

674
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,510
you know,
they're progressive or they're,

675
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:59,550
they're,
they're liberal or they're conservative 

676
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:00,420
and this everybody has a voice is 
everybody has a voice.

677
00:28:00,421 --> 00:28:02,250
There's so much voices.
I'll say this,

678
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:05,330
maybe you can appreciate this because 
we've,

679
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,840
we've lived,
were living in two worlds.

680
00:28:06,841 --> 00:28:10,920
We live when it wasn't here and we live 
in it's discretion.

681
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:15,000
Social media allows you not to have 
discretion.

682
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:20,180
You're able to go in and type whatever 
you want to say and that usually that's 

683
00:28:20,641 --> 00:28:23,460
what we pay attention to.
Discretion is this.

684
00:28:23,461 --> 00:28:25,230
We're sitting at the dinner table and 
yo,

685
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:28,830
I said something that you did like,
but the discretion was.

686
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:31,410
I'll address that later.
Right?

687
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,530
So now that you don't have any 
discretion,

688
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:38,280
anybody's voice can be heard.
Not everybody.

689
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:45,080
How do you say it?
Not everybody has a point that we should

690
00:28:46,561 --> 00:28:47,910
hook all of our wagons to.

691
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:53,320
What I noticed is that we will hook our 
wagons to the most extreme point and 

692
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,900
that may be only 2,500
people.

693
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,310
Like when my homies with him,
he said,

694
00:28:56,311 --> 00:28:57,070
man,
you hear what they say,

695
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:58,880
man it,
but as soon as I said how many views did

696
00:28:58,881 --> 00:29:00,060
it get?
80,000

697
00:29:00,061 --> 00:29:02,370
views.
I says 8 million people in philly alone.

698
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,250
Why are you just listening to those 
80,000

699
00:29:05,251 --> 00:29:10,251
people?
So you sort of have to put balance in 

700
00:29:10,251 --> 00:29:10,251
the way you sort of sift through it.
Does that make sense?

701
00:29:10,251 --> 00:29:11,310
It does make sense.
Yeah.

702
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,050
Well,
the way I tried to put it out to people,

703
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:15,720
if you're running into the room and 
there's 100 people in that room,

704
00:29:15,721 --> 00:29:18,210
what are the odds that one person is a 
fucking idiot.

705
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:19,620
One hundred percent,
right?

706
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,670
Yeah.
One person.

707
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:25,810
It almost,
almost every room of a random group of 

708
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:25,810
100 people and I'm being very,
very polite.

709
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:28,110
One person,
that means probably a few,

710
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,420
probably a few,
but let's go with one.

711
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:35,480
One out of 100.
So that means there's 3 million fucking 

712
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:38,260
idiots in this country.
Just straight idiots.

713
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:41,120
Non unfixable idiots.
yeah.

714
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:45,160
so if you're going to read the comments,
you're opening yourself up to that.

715
00:29:45,161 --> 00:29:50,161
If you're going to get your opinion 
swayed by people who just want to just 

716
00:29:50,161 --> 00:29:53,941
want to see if they can affect you,
just want to see if they can fuck with 

717
00:29:53,941 --> 00:29:57,351
you and touch you.
Just see a big james to get you to 

718
00:29:57,351 --> 00:29:58,690
change the way you're dressing.
That's probably I don't like.

719
00:29:58,691 --> 00:30:01,500
So I tell all of my artists and all my 
friends don't change.

720
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:06,690
Don't read it because what happens is 
everybody starts coloring inside the 

721
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:07,120
lines and then nobody's dangerous 
anymore.

722
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:08,950
Right?
Because you remember back in the day,

723
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:10,390
madonna,
dangerous point,

724
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:15,430
right?
I thought I'd come out naked just 

725
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:15,430
dancing to the grant.

726
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:15,430
He's like,
it's all good.

727
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:17,330
You know what I'm saying?
So what I hope will want,

728
00:30:17,331 --> 00:30:19,120
I always say,
just don't tuck your art in.

729
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,740
Don't tuck your art in for,
for the,

730
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:25,950
for the comments,
because we'll end up not having 

731
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:25,950
anything.
Not having anything to celebrate.

732
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:29,080
That is.
That is good.

733
00:30:29,081 --> 00:30:34,081
Like having something to celebrate.
Somebody did a song that was dope or 

734
00:30:34,081 --> 00:30:34,081
movie.
That was dope.

735
00:30:34,081 --> 00:30:35,710
I got outside the box as opposed to what
we love celebrating,

736
00:30:35,711 --> 00:30:37,300
which is the crazy shit.
You know what I mean?

737
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,110
Yeah.
Well,

738
00:30:38,111 --> 00:30:41,680
especially for comics because it's one 
per.

739
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:44,170
If you do a crazy movie is a lot of 
people involved.

740
00:30:44,171 --> 00:30:49,171
Yeah.
If you're onstage you say something 

741
00:30:49,171 --> 00:30:49,171
fucked up.
It's just you.

742
00:30:49,171 --> 00:30:50,140
Yeah.
I'm going back out.

743
00:30:50,141 --> 00:30:55,141
So it's about to happen.
I'm gonna be passing out a whole bunch 

744
00:30:55,141 --> 00:30:56,260
of gift baskets because I'm going back 
out and I,

745
00:30:56,261 --> 00:30:58,600
you know,
like how much time did you take off?

746
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:01,440
I've never actually taken off because I 
still do gigs.

747
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:03,310
Like I got a gig tomorrow,
st louis,

748
00:31:03,311 --> 00:31:04,240
you know,
private gig,

749
00:31:04,241 --> 00:31:04,900
whatever.
But,

750
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,750
but it's just,
you know,

751
00:31:07,751 --> 00:31:12,751
like I know like as a comedian you gotta
live like I just can't jump out there 

752
00:31:12,751 --> 00:31:14,230
and just started talking or writing 
jokes.

753
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:20,220
Like I've lived through some crazy shit 
so I got to go out there and talk about 

754
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:20,220
that.
You know,

755
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:24,090
had I not been hell because the one 
Thing I hate is the one thing that's 

756
00:31:24,341 --> 00:31:29,341
tough for comedian is to become 
successful because we talk from a shit 

757
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:35,400
is fucked up point of View and I got to 
have a little anger and I got to have a 

758
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:38,350
little poke fun and if I become that,
what if I become what I poke fun at,

759
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:43,650
then I can't get it off.
That's why my house people come to my 

760
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:43,650
house.

761
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:45,360
My daughter used to ask me this dad,
why is this room not?

762
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:51,000
There's nothing in it.
I said I dOn't want to complete the 

763
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,090
house because it gives me a sense of 
like,

764
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:55,750
I'm still trying to get on like I don't 
ever want.

765
00:31:55,751 --> 00:31:59,230
I don't put like all the pictures.
Nothing is perfect in my crib.

766
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:02,090
There's a curtain right now.
There's torn open in my bedroom,

767
00:32:02,091 --> 00:32:03,370
you know like what?
What's going on with j?

768
00:32:03,371 --> 00:32:04,430
Fox man,
what's going on?

769
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:10,300
Getting them checks when it was done and
I just said I just got to leave it like 

770
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:13,351
that.
I keep my house a little sore that we 

771
00:32:13,351 --> 00:32:15,121
call it the dysfunctional mention.
I talk about this dysfunctional 

772
00:32:15,121 --> 00:32:15,780
management where there's always somebody
like,

773
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:17,950
like the other night there's odell 
beckham in my house,

774
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:21,700
a battle dance and chris brown,
you know what I'm saying?

775
00:32:21,701 --> 00:32:22,540
Like,
who does that?

776
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:23,320
You know what I'm saying?
I just,

777
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:25,840
just crazy shit happening at my house 
all the time.

778
00:32:25,841 --> 00:32:28,030
So I could,
I have something to link my,

779
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,920
you know,
hitch my wagon to.

780
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:33,580
So you will create chaos on purpose and 
a little bit of.

781
00:32:33,581 --> 00:32:36,960
I'll just leave it slight disarray.
I,

782
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:39,130
I don't,
I don't remove myself.

783
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,300
It,
I don't remember.

784
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:43,760
I don't get behind the gates behind the 
gates of the worst shit behind the gates

785
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,530
behind the gates.
When you get behind the gates,

786
00:32:45,531 --> 00:32:47,480
when you reach a certain point and 
you're behind the gates,

787
00:32:47,481 --> 00:32:50,540
you can't really see what I'm out.
I got to be out with the people.

788
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:53,450
I got to have people like I had a,
a bet party,

789
00:32:53,451 --> 00:32:54,770
right?
3,000

790
00:32:54,771 --> 00:32:59,600
people in my house counted jesus.
People at the gate,

791
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:01,080
you know,
trying to get in.

792
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:04,760
And as I looked through the party,
there's floyd mayweather all time.

793
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:05,610
Y'all.
What's up?

794
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:06,190
J.
Fox.

795
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,300
What's up,
baby?

796
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,210
I love you man,
you got to fight crime and jail,

797
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:12,440
you know.
so there's Florida is fat joe.

798
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:17,650
ThIs little kim is on stage performing 
and then I look around and I see some of

799
00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:22,380
the homies,
like the real guys that whatsapp fox,

800
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,010
I just nice party right here cause I 
love it.

801
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:26,210
I'm like,
oh shit.

802
00:33:26,211 --> 00:33:29,960
So it's all of these mixtures of people 
that I can still touch,

803
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:33,770
hang out with people from my,
from my community.

804
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:35,330
Uh,
her name is bianca.

805
00:33:35,331 --> 00:33:38,840
She's like the unofficial mayor in our,
in our cities,

806
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:44,550
old little white lady from Germany and 
she's on the dance floor dancing with 

807
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:48,191
snoop snoopy.
The snoopy is so good in the weird.

808
00:33:49,331 --> 00:33:50,920
I don't know it,
it's crazy.

809
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,380
So I sort of keep it that way so I could
stay loose.

810
00:33:53,381 --> 00:33:58,381
So when I go out I got,
I got shit that I could talk about from 

811
00:33:58,381 --> 00:33:58,550
the hood.

812
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:04,260
So you're still,
you still manage to stay a regular 

813
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:04,260
person.
Got to.

814
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:08,670
But that's a hard thing for someone 
who's achieved as much success as you 

815
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:12,391
have.
that is not an easy balancing act to 

816
00:34:12,391 --> 00:34:15,781
stay normal because you must get 
overwhelmed by requests and people just 

817
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:19,780
wanting your time and wanted a hitch 
hitch themselves to you and.

818
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:20,650
But you got to

819
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:25,720
look.
I think what helpS me is to see the 

820
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:28,241
failures,
like doing a couple of movies that 

821
00:34:28,241 --> 00:34:32,470
don't,
you know what I'm saying?

822
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,180
Going through tsa.
They don't speak to you.

823
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:38,810
Your movie is out and then come over 
there.

824
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:40,610
They don't even make eye contact with 
you.

825
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:41,080
All right,
good.

826
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,370
Going through data movies.
So.

827
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:47,780
Or you just get the tsa goddamn fives.
What you doing baby?

828
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:49,820
What was that shit?
That shit dog.

829
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:51,380
I had to watch that shit on fire.
Stick my nigga.

830
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:52,880
Know what I'm saying?
Like oh.

831
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:57,830
So it's like you appreciate those which 
keeps you regular,

832
00:34:57,831 --> 00:34:59,810
keeps you humble.
And uh,

833
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:05,100
and you just got to sort of look at 
other people and see how people in our 

834
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,920
business when they do get behind the 
gates,

835
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:11,950
you know,
you've seen comics that get that 

836
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:13,130
thousand mile stare and don't want.
I don't mean funny no more.

837
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:15,010
Yeah.
I want you to be funny more.

838
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:16,640
That's how you came up.
I want to be sexy now.

839
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:20,420
You know what I'm saying?
They all fall into the sexy,

840
00:35:20,421 --> 00:35:20,850
you know?
Nah.

841
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:22,850
I don't want to say funny.
It keep the teeth gooby,

842
00:35:22,851 --> 00:35:27,851
keeping my head looking goofy hair at 
whatever it is because that's what I 

843
00:35:27,851 --> 00:35:29,390
draw upon when I go out because people 
can sense it,

844
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,430
don't you think?
Oh yeah,

845
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:34,390
yeah.
I think stand up is kind of in some ways

846
00:35:34,391 --> 00:35:39,391
it's a like a mind meld or a massive 
gnosis like gear connecting with the 

847
00:35:39,391 --> 00:35:43,971
audience and if there's anything false 
about what you're thinking or what 

848
00:35:43,971 --> 00:35:45,300
you're saying,
some of them at least can feel it.

849
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:50,840
SometImes all of them,
but some of them can feel it and it'll 

850
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,600
fuck with the energy of the room,
but if you're in the groove,

851
00:35:51,601 --> 00:35:54,590
you're really being yourself.
That's why when you see dave onstage,

852
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,750
one of the things about chappelle is 
that he's always himself.

853
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:03,440
He can just be himself and so you relax 
as an audience member and slide right 

854
00:36:03,571 --> 00:36:06,810
into his mind and he takes you on a 
journey because he's himself.

855
00:36:06,811 --> 00:36:07,740
He's not,
he's not.

856
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:13,100
He's not dIsconnected by fame and 
celebrity and that way he was cheating.

857
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:14,490
Yes.
How he passed up.

858
00:36:14,491 --> 00:36:19,491
All that money just went to africa,
just settled in and then came back and 

859
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:25,311
didn't do any scheduled gigs for years.
He would show up with a speaker and set 

860
00:36:26,471 --> 00:36:31,471
up a speaker in a park in seattle and 
just gather a crowd around and start 

861
00:36:31,471 --> 00:36:31,471
doing standup.

862
00:36:31,471 --> 00:36:32,200
Yeah,
my seat.

863
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:33,620
But that's what I'm saying.
It's like,

864
00:36:33,621 --> 00:36:36,860
how do you find that?
He figured it out how he did it?

865
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:41,150
Well,
I agree with that because like I said,

866
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:46,450
if you success can sometimes be our,
our coffin,

867
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:48,800
especially when you're,
like I said when you're,

868
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:53,860
when you're a comic,
even all the way down to the way I 

869
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:53,860
handled like,
like uh,

870
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:58,180
like social media is interested in me 
just sort of brand new on it and what 

871
00:36:58,221 --> 00:37:00,620
people view.
LIke I was a,

872
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:06,250
and this is sort of off off subject,
but I was just talking about how people 

873
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:09,941
view you.
I went to the gas station and I put on 

874
00:37:09,941 --> 00:37:12,370
these sheets and then I took a picture 
of him.

875
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,920
I thought it was cool.
I was at needed some pickup,

876
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:15,550
some,
you know,

877
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:20,740
$14 shit with her now put it on.
I took a picture with him and my 

878
00:37:21,321 --> 00:37:22,160
instagram blew up.

879
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:23,240
Like,
oh shit,

880
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:24,090
what's this?
I to come.

881
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:24,590
It's like,
man,

882
00:37:24,591 --> 00:37:29,591
when you get the shades.
And there was a ferragamos gucci's what 

883
00:37:29,591 --> 00:37:29,870
I'm saying like,
what are those dollar?

884
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,980
Hey,
let me get added fire.

885
00:37:30,981 --> 00:37:32,000
I was like,
wow,

886
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:37,180
it's just gas station shades.
But everybody thought they was,

887
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,470
you know,
something else.

888
00:37:39,471 --> 00:37:40,030
And I was like,
nah,

889
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:42,500
I don't want that.
I don't want them to think that.

890
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:44,690
I don't want them to think that I spent 
$2,000

891
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:49,900
because that's,
we always lose our fucking shades 

892
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:49,900
anyway.
Right.

893
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,270
So I actually hit my boy davao and uh,
dave schottenstein,

894
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:53,300
I said,
listen,

895
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:57,230
I want to do a eyeglass,
like,

896
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:57,580
whoa,
whoa,

897
00:37:57,581 --> 00:37:58,540
what are you going to do?
You want to go?

898
00:37:58,580 --> 00:37:58,940
I said,
no,

899
00:37:58,941 --> 00:37:59,150
no,
no,

900
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:03,860
I want to do an eyeglass that costs less
than $30.

901
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:09,430
I said,
but what we're gonna do is we're going 

902
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:09,430
to go through each frame and make sure 
each frame is tight,

903
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:10,220
like the dope,
like amazing.

904
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:15,220
Because I told them the story about 
being at the gas station and they were 

905
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:15,220
liKe,
wow,

906
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:17,180
I think that's a good idea.
So we ended up doing this whole line.

907
00:38:17,181 --> 00:38:19,550
I went through all 200 frames and we 
did.

908
00:38:19,551 --> 00:38:22,970
This line's a,
it's called a revolt,

909
00:38:22,971 --> 00:38:27,971
right?
And everybody thought that it was 

910
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:31,490
something else.
30 bucks,

911
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:37,390
$30 shiFts and now even dot lo,
bella thorne and all these other people 

912
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:42,060
are wearing the shades.
BeCause what we noticed when we did do 

913
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:44,671
that,
people embrace it a little more because 

914
00:38:44,671 --> 00:38:47,611
we did a commercial that was that we 
almost made that mistake where we get 

915
00:38:47,611 --> 00:38:52,230
clothes on and we tell people how much 
the clothes cost and people got turned 

916
00:38:54,641 --> 00:38:58,040
off because the jeans were like $400.
Jacket was 2000.

917
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:59,020
They were like,
what the fuck?

918
00:38:59,420 --> 00:38:59,920
And I'm like,
no.

919
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:02,690
What we were trying to say was,
although these closing costs,

920
00:39:02,691 --> 00:39:07,691
it's our glasses only cost 30 bucks.
So that story In itself,

921
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,260
I take that and run with that and say 
like,

922
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:15,360
I'm not the guy buying the high end,
you know stuff.

923
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:18,690
I want to keep it sorta cool.
Regular,

924
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:19,600
you know what I'm saying?

925
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:20,870
Yeah.
Does that make sense?

926
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:21,960
it does.
Yeah.

927
00:39:21,961 --> 00:39:23,990
I know it really rich dude who drives a 
pickup truck.

928
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:29,380
He's rich as fuck and he just likes to 
drive around in a shitty old toyota 

929
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:29,380
pickup truck.
He likes it.

930
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:31,630
And why you do that?
Because he wants to feel normal,

931
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,200
feel normal,
feel grimy.

932
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:35,690
You want to feel normal.
He doesn't wash his hands sometimes.

933
00:39:35,691 --> 00:39:40,691
Get dirt under his fingernails.
pretends he's a farmer and combined a 

934
00:39:40,691 --> 00:39:42,080
whole fucking world.
People are weird like that.

935
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:44,930
But we have to balance both because I.
Because,

936
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:45,770
because you know,
you know,

937
00:39:45,771 --> 00:39:46,370
beIng,
being,

938
00:39:46,371 --> 00:39:46,930
you know,
being,

939
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:51,950
being urban,
I got to step out there and shine 

940
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:51,950
sometimes too.
I'm a boy has,

941
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:51,950
you know,
you know,

942
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:51,970
we,
we,

943
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:55,010
we get out there and we show a little 
bit of the suCcess,

944
00:39:55,400 --> 00:40:00,400
you know what I'm saying?
Just to let people know we're still 

945
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:00,400
doing our thing.

946
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,970
The expression being urban that 
happened.

947
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,620
How did it become urban?
Wait,

948
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:05,500
what year was that?

949
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:08,620
Joking like I'm blaCk.
I tell people all the time,

950
00:40:08,621 --> 00:40:12,730
I'm going to nicc h nica if I lose,
if I lose,

951
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:14,970
if I lose me in that,
then I,

952
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:17,060
I got to have that.
You know what I'm saying?

953
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,630
Oh god,
yeah,

954
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:19,720
I got it.
Yeah,

955
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:20,710
no,
I got it.

956
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:23,470
You got to have everything.
It's fun to write.

957
00:40:23,471 --> 00:40:24,190
Yeah,
it's fun too.

958
00:40:24,191 --> 00:40:29,191
but I gotta I gotta have that part.
I got to have always had that sorta like

959
00:40:29,291 --> 00:40:34,291
a can't leave.
Can't leave where I came from because 

960
00:40:34,291 --> 00:40:34,291
that's what they try to snatch from me.
That's why we did.

961
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:39,300
We did the television show.
Chris spencer in a buddy lewis wrote 

962
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:42,541
this,
wrote this incredible script called 

963
00:40:42,541 --> 00:40:45,121
white famous and white famous was about 
a comedian who's trying to become 

964
00:40:45,791 --> 00:40:48,250
mainstream without losing his,
you know,

965
00:40:48,251 --> 00:40:49,930
his black audience,
which is all these.

966
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:51,160
All of us.
We go through that,

967
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:56,590
you know,
because the minute you started doing 

968
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:56,590
the,
you know,

969
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:56,590
the,
the,

970
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:59,860
the sort of soft movies and brother man,
you don't cuss no more motherfuckers

971
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:03,370
you cussing.
You know,

972
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:07,980
I think the problem with shining is when
it defines you problem when,

973
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:10,850
when you just.
Everything is flat like floyd mayweather

974
00:41:10,851 --> 00:41:15,851
in a way.
It's part of his persona as part of why 

975
00:41:15,851 --> 00:41:17,240
people root against him.
Like ford is a genius and he my printing

976
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:20,360
not just a genius boxing,
he's the greatest defensive boxer,

977
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:24,080
my opinion of all time,
but also a genius in that he figured out

978
00:41:24,081 --> 00:41:27,900
a way where he has this style that's not
appealing to a lot of people,

979
00:41:28,370 --> 00:41:33,370
but what is appealing is people want to 
see him get his ass kicked and it never 

980
00:41:33,370 --> 00:41:33,410
fucking happened.
Listen,

981
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:33,810
in

982
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:39,380
floyd's the hmi floyd comes by the house
man and I don't want to put everything 

983
00:41:39,391 --> 00:41:41,850
out there that he does.
He's super,

984
00:41:41,851 --> 00:41:44,730
super competItive.
That's what's amazing.

985
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:47,970
But he also understands that yo,
j fox,

986
00:41:47,971 --> 00:41:49,540
I understanding what's going on.
Your alternate.

987
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:50,020
They,
they,

988
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,830
they want me to follow j fox,
but that's what keeps me competitive all

989
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:54,020
the time.
Easy work,

990
00:41:54,021 --> 00:41:57,450
light work.
So he would sit at my crib and speak for

991
00:41:57,451 --> 00:42:02,451
like hours about the business of it,
trying to turn these boxers.

992
00:42:04,501 --> 00:42:05,640
Mine's on like,
yo,

993
00:42:05,641 --> 00:42:07,290
get your money,
know what I'm saying?

994
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:09,090
Don't get your money,
get your business,

995
00:42:09,091 --> 00:42:14,091
get on.
And then he talks about just what you 

996
00:42:14,091 --> 00:42:14,091
said.
He says,

997
00:42:14,091 --> 00:42:16,790
I know the reason that I fight oscar de 
la hoya on cinco de mayo is because they

998
00:42:18,571 --> 00:42:19,430
want to see the va.
He,

999
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,250
he,
he,

1000
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,920
he,
he carved out a niche for

1001
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:22,760
being the,
the,

1002
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:25,260
the,
the charismatic villain.

1003
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:26,290
does that make sense?
Yeah.

1004
00:42:26,291 --> 00:42:28,020
And he wasn't in the beginning.
he wasn't,

1005
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:31,350
he,
he was pretty boy floyd mayweather here.

1006
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,640
And then he became money mayweather.
Yeah.

1007
00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:36,690
But had he stayed pretty boy.
Who the fuck does that mean?

1008
00:42:36,691 --> 00:42:38,640
He might've been like sugar shane mosley
or something,

1009
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:44,750
but not really because shane had lost to
a few guys like what floyd did better 

1010
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:46,290
than anybody is not get hit.
Yeah.

1011
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,450
Yeah.
He's been here like six times.

1012
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,170
Right?
Right.

1013
00:42:49,171 --> 00:42:50,970
Like really hard.
Like six times.

1014
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,140
And zap judy?
Yeah.

1015
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,660
Zeb judo.
Uh,

1016
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:58,210
his defining fight was the morale is 
fight when he fought morales.

1017
00:42:58,211 --> 00:43:03,211
God bless was amazing in that he also 
said that that hit the sugar.

1018
00:43:03,221 --> 00:43:05,860
Shane hit him and he'll tell you.
Said that hit when sugar,

1019
00:43:05,861 --> 00:43:07,600
shane touched him.
He said that really,

1020
00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:09,090
as she said,
shook me.

1021
00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:09,720
Said,
well Jeff Fox,

1022
00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:10,230
shit,
I'll kill him.

1023
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,920
J fox,
I got to kill me.

1024
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:17,400
He said,
that's why I dug in and you see the 

1025
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,840
energy.
You see the end of the round and end 

1026
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:18,840
around.
He did turn it,

1027
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:18,840
but he's.

1028
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:19,320
He got rocked In that fight.
That was one of the few moments where he

1029
00:43:19,321 --> 00:43:21,330
really got caught by a world class 
fighter.

1030
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:23,070
Yeah.
Got caught cleaned twice,

1031
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:25,350
so it'll be interesting.
This next fight coming up.

1032
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:25,930
Well,

1033
00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:29,050
connor's not that level of boxer.
You know someone.

1034
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:30,460
I forget who it was.
It said it.

1035
00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:33,300
I think it might've been a daily.
Yeah,

1036
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:38,530
but someone was saying that he's got to.
I was patent [inaudible] saying that he 

1037
00:43:38,530 --> 00:43:42,751
has to almost cheat within the rules and
I think he's got to like fight in the 

1038
00:43:42,791 --> 00:43:44,710
clinic.
She's got to like dirty box.

1039
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:49,660
He's got to figure out a way to tie him 
up and manipulate them and move his body

1040
00:43:49,661 --> 00:43:54,661
around.
He's got to figure out A way to be good 

1041
00:43:54,661 --> 00:43:56,290
defensively to and he's got a hurt them.
Those would all be like high,

1042
00:43:57,130 --> 00:43:58,630
high risk,
high risk,

1043
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:03,840
low yield possibilities.
It's the way I described it.

1044
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:07,090
If you,
how would you expect the greatest figure

1045
00:44:07,091 --> 00:44:11,430
skater in the world to do playing hockey
against wayne gretzky high?

1046
00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:18,230
It's not the same thing.
What is fucking exciting,

1047
00:44:19,570 --> 00:44:22,570
greatest freak show ever?
He says the greatest freak show ever.

1048
00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:27,670
Um,
I'm waiting for that fight more than 

1049
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:30,061
canelo alvarez versus gennady golovkin.
Even though that fight is a legitimate 

1050
00:44:30,061 --> 00:44:31,830
fight.
Fight but can't because it's going to be

1051
00:44:31,831 --> 00:44:33,300
some crazy shit.
Some crazy shit.

1052
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:34,340
He's gonna be so crazy.
Well,

1053
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:39,350
also there's the mindfuck factor.
He's the connor's the only guy that 

1054
00:44:39,350 --> 00:44:39,810
floyd's ever fought that can look at 
them and go,

1055
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:42,540
if this was a real fight,
you'd be fucking dead.

1056
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:46,740
Oh knows he knows it.
EveRybody else floyd's been able to fuck

1057
00:44:46,741 --> 00:44:48,060
up.
He fucks up all of them,

1058
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:49,090
you know,
like,

1059
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:51,360
do you ever see that video with him and 
robert carero?

1060
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:54,290
Right before they fought,
they had this,

1061
00:44:54,291 --> 00:44:59,291
um,
this thing where they were doing photo 

1062
00:44:59,291 --> 00:44:59,291
shoots and they to do a stereo.
Is it?

1063
00:44:59,291 --> 00:45:02,880
Who's this roBert that goes?
Guerrero is a fighter that floyd for 

1064
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:02,880
maybe four or five,
five years ago,

1065
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:06,040
and he just worked for 12 rounds.
Spirit the shit out,

1066
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:07,860
but he's standing right in front of 
them.

1067
00:45:07,861 --> 00:45:09,030
He said,
you ain't gonna do shit.

1068
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:10,560
He's like,
you're easy work.

1069
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:12,210
You're easy work.
He goes,

1070
00:45:12,211 --> 00:45:12,930
he goes,
he goes,

1071
00:45:12,931 --> 00:45:13,830
I'm just gonna stack.
It goes,

1072
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:15,870
no one has to get involved.
You're not going to do shit.

1073
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:17,490
He goes,
we'll get right close to each other.

1074
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:19,350
You're not going to do shit.
You're easy work.

1075
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:20,910
And you could see the dude was just 
like,

1076
00:45:21,330 --> 00:45:23,040
oh no.
Like he knew.

1077
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:25,580
He knew that floyd was right,
right?

1078
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:27,540
Well,
when connor looks at him and goes,

1079
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:30,000
if this is a real fight,
I'd fucking kill you.

1080
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:33,180
I'll do your boxing thing.
It's a real fight.

1081
00:45:33,181 --> 00:45:35,550
I'll kill you.
Oh yeah,

1082
00:45:35,551 --> 00:45:36,030
he's right.

1083
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:36,930
He's right.
Like,

1084
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:38,370
if you could say,
oh,

1085
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:40,860
this how we'll do some mma.
He said it a couple times.

1086
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:45,980
Next fight will do mma.
He's not doing floyd floyd thing float 

1087
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:47,540
is smart.
yeah.

1088
00:45:47,910 --> 00:45:49,890
So he looked.
He's got him on his,

1089
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:50,880
his,
his,

1090
00:45:51,030 --> 00:45:55,920
his play and feel.
So it's almost like you start to like.

1091
00:45:55,921 --> 00:46:00,921
I know,
but people started to go like as floyd 

1092
00:46:00,921 --> 00:46:01,560
nervous.
I said,

1093
00:46:01,561 --> 00:46:03,030
I don't know,
but I tell you this,

1094
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:08,360
he's definitely allowing this guy to 
play through in that fight is becoming 

1095
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:08,970
bigger,
bigger,

1096
00:46:09,390 --> 00:46:10,410
bigger,
bigger.

1097
00:46:10,411 --> 00:46:12,990
So it's like it's going to be,
it's going to be great.

1098
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:14,520
And the one thing float would always 
tell me though,

1099
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:17,420
he said j fox.
He said the one thing they not ready for

1100
00:46:17,421 --> 00:46:18,360
it,
it's the lights.

1101
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:19,620
I said,
what you mean?

1102
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:25,010
He said the lights,
when the lights are that bright and you 

1103
00:46:25,010 --> 00:46:25,620
look out and you see all,
you see denzel,

1104
00:46:25,621 --> 00:46:26,280
you see all these.

1105
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:31,380
That's a different.
That's a different thing because it was 

1106
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:31,380
tough.
I don't know if it was hatton.

1107
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:32,280
I think we're talking about hat and 
sending the lights,

1108
00:46:32,310 --> 00:46:37,310
man.
He said that's the one thing I've been 

1109
00:46:37,310 --> 00:46:37,310
fighting j five and fighting under the 
license.

1110
00:46:37,310 --> 00:46:38,700
I was like this.
So it's going to be interesting.

1111
00:46:38,910 --> 00:46:43,910
Yeah.
This is going to be interesting me 

1112
00:46:43,910 --> 00:46:43,910
crazy,
but connor fights under the lights too.

1113
00:46:43,910 --> 00:46:46,960
We just never boxed anybody like that.
That's going to be a totally alien 

1114
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:47,670
thing.
When he gets into that ring and he's got

1115
00:46:47,671 --> 00:46:51,780
shoes on and he fills those big ass 
gloves on his hands and then it looks on

1116
00:46:51,781 --> 00:46:56,781
the other side.
He sees floyd is moving around and 

1117
00:46:56,781 --> 00:46:56,781
getting ready.
He's got.

1118
00:46:56,781 --> 00:46:59,220
There's going to be a shit.
It's going to be something in there.

1119
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:02,430
It's going to be everything except me 
fucking everything.

1120
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:03,450
Because you think about it.

1121
00:47:03,450 --> 00:47:05,550
They both.
I mean they got us.

1122
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:07,580
They got us.
I'm going to that motherfucker.

1123
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:08,860
I'm going early.
Oh,

1124
00:47:09,170 --> 00:47:11,110
press conferences were amazing.
Yeah.

1125
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:16,490
I'm already booked.
I was booked in dc that nIght in 

1126
00:47:16,490 --> 00:47:19,881
advance.
I saw already sold out two shows that 

1127
00:47:19,881 --> 00:47:19,881
night.
I couldn't.

1128
00:47:19,881 --> 00:47:21,770
I couldn't cancel and you can't come.
No,

1129
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:22,860
I can't come.
I'm not going to be there.

1130
00:47:22,861 --> 00:47:25,050
I'm not going to work at either.
They wanted me to do something for it.

1131
00:47:25,051 --> 00:47:26,390
I couldn't loan.
Can't even do it.

1132
00:47:26,391 --> 00:47:30,100
That's going to be the.
I gotta figure out a way to see it.

1133
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:33,760
Until not know what happened is normally
watch it.

1134
00:47:34,590 --> 00:47:39,590
I'm going to have to figure out a way.
I hope the audience would be nice and 

1135
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:42,531
not telling me it's probably going to be
people watching it on their phone while 

1136
00:47:42,611 --> 00:47:47,611
the show's going on.
Like I guarantee you if someone gets 

1137
00:47:47,611 --> 00:47:50,821
knocked down,
you're going to hear from the audience 

1138
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:51,910
what joke was.
Yeah,

1139
00:47:51,911 --> 00:47:53,920
what happened is great Man.
Great man.

1140
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:57,900
it's gonna be interesting.
Listen man.

1141
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:00,400
yEah,
there you go.

1142
00:48:00,401 --> 00:48:01,690
From here,
I don't know where we were.

1143
00:48:01,730 --> 00:48:03,260
That's where we started.
Where do we go from here?

1144
00:48:03,470 --> 00:48:06,710
We'll just keep moving and keep moving.
You're obviously enjoying yourself.

1145
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:08,100
You're.
I'm having.

1146
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,820
I'm having a good time for a super 
successful guy.

1147
00:48:10,821 --> 00:48:14,280
You seem completely balanced today.
There are,

1148
00:48:14,281 --> 00:48:18,150
there are things that you just cannot 
get away from that you know,

1149
00:48:18,151 --> 00:48:23,151
you hide right behind.
But for the most part I did some smart 

1150
00:48:23,151 --> 00:48:23,151
stuff.

1151
00:48:23,151 --> 00:48:26,570
Moving my,
my whole family lives with me so I had 

1152
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:26,570
to worry about,
you know,

1153
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:28,320
my,
my father and my mom lived with me.

1154
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:29,440
Oh that's great.
Yeah.

1155
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:31,260
Yeah.
And I was adopted seven months,

1156
00:48:31,261 --> 00:48:31,780
so,
you know,

1157
00:48:31,830 --> 00:48:34,620
and my mom,
me and my mom and my biological mom,

1158
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:38,210
you know,
or crafting our relationship now in the,

1159
00:48:38,211 --> 00:48:41,160
in the latter stages of her life.
So,

1160
00:48:41,161 --> 00:48:41,850
you know,
that's,

1161
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:42,810
you know,
but I didn't want,

1162
00:48:42,811 --> 00:48:44,670
but I didn't want no bullshit outside of
that,

1163
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:45,960
you know,
where someone is,

1164
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:46,990
is,
is,

1165
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:49,190
is sitting somewhere watching me from a 
distance,

1166
00:48:49,950 --> 00:48:51,190
you know,
that,

1167
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:56,360
you know,
so mom comes in and they've been 

1168
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:56,360
divorced for almost 30 years.
It was crazy.

1169
00:48:56,570 --> 00:48:58,890
So thEy live in the same,
same under the same roof.

1170
00:48:58,891 --> 00:49:00,360
It's hilarious.
That's a whole nother show.

1171
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:01,770
Wow.
And uh,

1172
00:49:01,771 --> 00:49:04,440
he's still dates,
you know what I'm saying?

1173
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:06,300
He's still getting it in and be over 
there.

1174
00:49:06,570 --> 00:49:09,030
And then she'll float over to his side 
of the house.

1175
00:49:09,031 --> 00:49:10,290
It'd be like,
let's see the girl,

1176
00:49:10,291 --> 00:49:10,940
hey,
how are you?

1177
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:13,260
How are you?
Hi george.

1178
00:49:13,261 --> 00:49:15,500
This is who is this?
You know,

1179
00:49:15,690 --> 00:49:20,690
she's getting somebody.
I just want to get something out the 

1180
00:49:20,690 --> 00:49:20,690
refrigerator,
some spoils,

1181
00:49:20,690 --> 00:49:23,490
stuff that does kind of intense.
And then you hear that on my door,

1182
00:49:23,550 --> 00:49:24,670
ms.my
mom and my pops.

1183
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:29,750
Uh,
could you tell her not to come on my 

1184
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:29,750
side of the house?
Shit,

1185
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:29,850
I'm like man,
I'm parents,

1186
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:31,580
you know,
so,

1187
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:36,640
but it's certain things that I got to 
figure out your happiness and the only 

1188
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:42,641
way you figure out your happiness,
you got to try to see or foresee what's 

1189
00:49:42,641 --> 00:49:46,070
going to be the problem.
So I get my family close to me.

1190
00:49:46,071 --> 00:49:49,040
So whatever problem we got to work out,
we work that shit out right here.

1191
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:54,880
Get my mom and my,
and my and my sisters and my and my 

1192
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:54,880
daughter's close to me.

1193
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:57,310
So they see daddy going to work.
Like there's still some work shit.

1194
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:57,850
It's like,
no,

1195
00:49:57,860 --> 00:50:00,110
we just not on the red card.
It's not just red carpet everyday,

1196
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:01,340
you know,
I gotta get up,

1197
00:50:01,341 --> 00:50:03,890
I gotta go,
I gotta talk shit.

1198
00:50:03,891 --> 00:50:08,891
I got to kiss a little ass here.
I gotta I gotta do a whole lot of shit 

1199
00:50:08,891 --> 00:50:09,710
in order to keep this thing going.
So you try to,

1200
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:11,750
you know,
in life you try to see what,

1201
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:14,170
try to foresee what's going to happen.
It still going to be something.

1202
00:50:14,290 --> 00:50:17,450
So it's always gonna be something just 
outlandish and uh,

1203
00:50:17,451 --> 00:50:18,110
but uh,
you,

1204
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:19,790
you try to get,
get in front of it.

1205
00:50:20,370 --> 00:50:21,870
That's an interesting way to handle it 
though,

1206
00:50:21,871 --> 00:50:24,360
to bring everybody close to bring your 
whole family and your house.

1207
00:50:24,390 --> 00:50:25,530
Yeah.
And not everybody can do that,

1208
00:50:25,531 --> 00:50:26,490
you know,
because you know,

1209
00:50:26,530 --> 00:50:27,950
it's like,
you know,

1210
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:30,620
me growing up as an only child,
I liked having people around.

1211
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:32,900
I can't be by myself.
That's why I always would throw parties.

1212
00:50:32,910 --> 00:50:37,910
I can,
I would kidnap people like come to my 

1213
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:37,910
house.
Why you got to leave man.

1214
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:37,940
Chris,
chris man.

1215
00:50:37,941 --> 00:50:38,330
Just say,
man,

1216
00:50:38,331 --> 00:50:43,331
I got a real fluid mid state New York 
because I just wanted people right now 

1217
00:50:43,331 --> 00:50:43,400
having my family around you.
You got to do.

1218
00:50:43,401 --> 00:50:44,900
But not like I said,
not everybody can do it.

1219
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:46,210
[inaudible] it,
it,

1220
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:47,430
it's,
it's,

1221
00:50:47,550 --> 00:50:50,090
it's interesting.
Like my father who has a great story,

1222
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:52,550
my stepfather has a great story.
You know,

1223
00:50:52,551 --> 00:50:57,551
he was on drugs or,
or at had a situation about what drug 

1224
00:50:57,551 --> 00:50:59,360
bout with crack.
Ended up going to jail.

1225
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:01,080
I wrote him one letter.
I said,

1226
00:51:01,090 --> 00:51:02,780
you get out,
you know,

1227
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:08,430
I save your life because I didn't like 
writing letters to people in jail and 

1228
00:51:08,430 --> 00:51:09,140
like going visiting people in jail.
He gets out.

1229
00:51:09,141 --> 00:51:10,730
This is around just before nine slash 
11.

1230
00:51:10,730 --> 00:51:14,270
And then my stepfather was incredible in
my life because he taught me how to play

1231
00:51:14,271 --> 00:51:16,820
tennis.
So back in the seventies,

1232
00:51:16,890 --> 00:51:17,400
in the,
in the,

1233
00:51:17,401 --> 00:51:17,920
in the,
in the,

1234
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:20,240
in the eighties,
he was like playing tennis.

1235
00:51:20,241 --> 00:51:20,800
I was like,
wow,

1236
00:51:20,801 --> 00:51:22,520
I've never seen a black dude play 
tennis.

1237
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:27,880
He said,
you got to learn some people like yanik 

1238
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:28,400
noah,
elina stasi beyond board,

1239
00:51:28,401 --> 00:51:30,350
vitos gerulaitis.
Those were like heroes of mine.

1240
00:51:30,351 --> 00:51:32,720
So he taught me how to play play tennis.
So when he gets out,

1241
00:51:32,721 --> 00:51:34,640
he gets out of jail and make sure 
everything is cool.

1242
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:40,060
I take him to the us open.
And so there is me and my pops watching 

1243
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:41,990
venus when he's crying.
I'm like,

1244
00:51:41,991 --> 00:51:42,540
yeah,
dad,

1245
00:51:42,730 --> 00:51:45,140
you know this,
this is how we got to live.

1246
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:47,150
This is what,
this is what we need to do.

1247
00:51:47,450 --> 00:51:49,970
So he watches venus play and then a 
couple of days after that,

1248
00:51:49,971 --> 00:51:50,750
it was nine slash 11.

1249
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:52,580
Uh,
but you know,

1250
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:55,580
he stayed with me,
he's been with me since then,

1251
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:57,770
you know,
it early on I would just go by and check

1252
00:51:57,771 --> 00:52:00,290
the drawers,
make sure there's no paraphernalia,

1253
00:52:00,291 --> 00:52:01,930
no wrong shit,
smoke your weed.

1254
00:52:02,450 --> 00:52:04,070
It,
don't do no more than that.

1255
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:06,230
And we've been cool since then,
you know,

1256
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:09,500
and it saved a lot of money in rehab,
you know what I'm saying?

1257
00:52:09,501 --> 00:52:11,980
So I'm just right there and hands on.
But uh,

1258
00:52:12,050 --> 00:52:17,050
well sometimes people just being 
surrounded by loved ones is enough to 

1259
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:17,050
keep them from doing anything stupid.
Yeah,

1260
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:17,120
it can,
it can.

1261
00:52:17,150 --> 00:52:19,070
And it was,
it was bumpy at first,

1262
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:21,950
won't go into it because he wrote a 
little book and talked about it.

1263
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:26,390
It was bumpy at first because when he 
first got out I did some shit for him.

1264
00:52:26,391 --> 00:52:27,260
Got him,
got him,

1265
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:28,340
got him a car,
whatever.

1266
00:52:28,550 --> 00:52:30,000
He relapsed this car,
gone.

1267
00:52:30,030 --> 00:52:31,520
He's back in,
you know.

1268
00:52:31,521 --> 00:52:33,920
So it was a couple little things that we
had to work out,

1269
00:52:33,921 --> 00:52:36,320
but now you know,
to see him now like,

1270
00:52:36,321 --> 00:52:37,590
you know,
you know,

1271
00:52:37,610 --> 00:52:38,900
like uh,
you know,

1272
00:52:38,901 --> 00:52:40,640
we go to these different events or 
whatever like that.

1273
00:52:40,641 --> 00:52:41,810
He,
his whole wall,

1274
00:52:41,811 --> 00:52:43,550
he old school,
he don't,

1275
00:52:43,551 --> 00:52:45,020
he don't do this,
you know.

1276
00:52:45,021 --> 00:52:47,560
Then he got the actual photos.
He goes,

1277
00:52:47,590 --> 00:52:52,590
he goes to develop the,
like I made a little film so he put the 

1278
00:52:52,590 --> 00:52:52,590
film in to develop the field,
see it,

1279
00:52:52,590 --> 00:52:54,890
and they put the field and he got a 
whole wall and everybody's needs met,

1280
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:56,150
you know,
all of his heroes.

1281
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:58,700
And so like I said,
you know,

1282
00:52:58,701 --> 00:53:01,850
I try to try to look,
uh,

1283
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:05,810
try to be ahead of the curve when it 
comes to the fucked up shit.

1284
00:53:06,110 --> 00:53:09,750
What about like where your creative time
when you have 20 people living with you,

1285
00:53:09,810 --> 00:53:12,380
did you get,
do you ever feel boxed in?

1286
00:53:12,410 --> 00:53:13,030
Nah,
that's,

1287
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:18,240
you know,
like I know the best way to create us 

1288
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:18,800
and have people around because I could 
try that joke out on them and they don't

1289
00:53:18,801 --> 00:53:21,200
know I'm doing that job,
you know what I'm saying?

1290
00:53:21,201 --> 00:53:23,780
I could try this idea,
see how they respond because your family

1291
00:53:23,781 --> 00:53:26,460
gonna give you the real giving me that 
as terrible.

1292
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:31,470
See how you made it.
That's what I'm saying.

1293
00:53:31,471 --> 00:53:35,880
So you always got to me having people 
around to tell you the truth,

1294
00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:38,160
you know,
like everybody in my family,

1295
00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:40,530
you know,
they tell me it's true for basil,

1296
00:53:41,330 --> 00:53:43,430
sleepless.
I should've just stayed sleep as that.

1297
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:45,390
Oh shit really is fucked up.
Yeah.

1298
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:46,380
So it's like,
you know,

1299
00:53:46,381 --> 00:53:51,381
having that allows me to create.
And then I have my own little space 

1300
00:53:51,381 --> 00:53:51,381
where I go,
okay,

1301
00:53:51,381 --> 00:53:54,000
let me get this now let me.
They responded to that.

1302
00:53:54,010 --> 00:53:56,790
Now let me put this together over here 
in a little space.

1303
00:53:56,791 --> 00:53:59,950
So you have like a little sanctuary.
I got a little studio that I,

1304
00:54:00,090 --> 00:54:02,310
that I set up where I go in there and do
all that shit,

1305
00:54:02,311 --> 00:54:03,570
you know?
But it helps.

1306
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:09,600
Well listen man,
I know you gotta get the fuck out of 

1307
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:09,600
here.
You only here for an hour,

1308
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:09,600
right?
Yeah,

1309
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:10,960
it's been great dude.
Listen,

1310
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:14,050
you are,
you're an amazing person and I'm very,

1311
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:19,100
I'm very honored to have you on here 
because you're one of the very few 

1312
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:22,561
people that I know that has this a well 
rounded life,

1313
00:54:23,350 --> 00:54:28,350
but also it's very balanced.
Like you've had amazing success and all 

1314
00:54:28,350 --> 00:54:29,980
these different things,
but you're as normal and approachable as

1315
00:54:29,981 --> 00:54:31,630
anybody I know when it come to you,

1316
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:34,450
you know,
I got to be why you?

1317
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:40,940
Because you are a speaker of truth and 
we ain't seen each other in a while.

1318
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:47,090
But the one thIng about your opinion is 
always going to be truthful.

1319
00:54:47,210 --> 00:54:50,090
So you know,
as us coming from a different time,

1320
00:54:51,850 --> 00:54:56,320
there's certain people that we want to 
have the real truth come from you.

1321
00:54:56,650 --> 00:54:58,000
Rock,
chappelle,

1322
00:54:58,240 --> 00:54:59,770
all these guys.
So we came up.

1323
00:55:00,190 --> 00:55:04,660
So when we're doing our art and when 
we're doing whatever we do,

1324
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:06,370
it's always going to be those people 
that,

1325
00:55:06,371 --> 00:55:11,371
you know rock with you,
but you want to get the people who have 

1326
00:55:11,371 --> 00:55:13,230
a really artistic,
real opinion.

1327
00:55:13,290 --> 00:55:14,480
Does that make sense?
I know.

1328
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:17,950
And if you hear them say y'all kind of 
fuck with that now.

1329
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:18,750
Okay,
I got that.

1330
00:55:19,010 --> 00:55:21,510
If jr says that's cool,
then I know.

1331
00:55:21,511 --> 00:55:21,930
And I said,
why?

1332
00:55:21,931 --> 00:55:23,640
Why do you say that?
Because that motherfucker tell you,

1333
00:55:23,641 --> 00:55:25,680
he'll tell you that that shit's whack.
You know what I'm saying?

1334
00:55:25,681 --> 00:55:27,210
And then it whoop your ass.
You know what I'm saying?

1335
00:55:27,211 --> 00:55:28,080
So you gotta be,
you know,

1336
00:55:28,081 --> 00:55:33,081
you gotta be on point with this because 
I know when I run into those guys like 

1337
00:55:33,081 --> 00:55:34,590
you,
you want to have

1338
00:55:36,570 --> 00:55:38,190
that favor.
does that make sense?
