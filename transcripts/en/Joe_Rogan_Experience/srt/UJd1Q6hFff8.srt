1
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,090
Uh,

2
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:16,380
oh wow.
I trust this guy.

3
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:22,780
You just sense it when it happened.
He tells me he gives me a countdown.

4
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:23,420
Oh,
okay.

5
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:24,253
I see.
Gives me countdown and then he does 

6
00:00:25,091 --> 00:00:26,320
this.
Oh,

7
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:28,210
that's cool.
I'm trying to bring that back.

8
00:00:28,211 --> 00:00:29,620
When you see,
see people and you like him,

9
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:33,910
you give him the double double guns.
It's a hard,

10
00:00:33,911 --> 00:00:35,890
hard sell these days.
Why?

11
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:37,960
Everybody's scared of guns.
Oh,

12
00:00:37,961 --> 00:00:41,660
you're saying it's funny.
You know,

13
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,553
like if the odds of you doing it,
you have to do it within a certain 

14
00:00:44,741 --> 00:00:47,770
amount of time from a mass shooting.
Right?

15
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,910
Like you couldn't do it the day of.
I couldn't be like a columbine.

16
00:00:51,911 --> 00:00:52,744
You like dunk.

17
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:56,980
Wow.
He's so morose.

18
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,770
We're fucked up.
Sense of humor that guy's got,

19
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:02,350
he's making fun day.
How could you,

20
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:04,760
why is that funny to him?
That is not fine.

21
00:01:04,761 --> 00:01:07,040
I can't believe you're fucking doing 
those signs to,

22
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:09,500
can I sit down and talk to you for a 
second bro?

23
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,353
Don't you think it's time?
It's time to really talk about using 

24
00:01:12,221 --> 00:01:14,890
these guns.
Gestures because honestly,

25
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:20,250
I know it's not really hurting anybody,
but we have to pay respect to the people

26
00:01:20,761 --> 00:01:21,594
who've lost their lives in these 
terrible weapons and I just think we 

27
00:01:24,431 --> 00:01:28,480
should remove it for rails.
You just show me the replacement Emoji.

28
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,610
Apple has a new Emoji.
They got rid of the pistol and they put,

29
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:33,640
they turn it into a water gun.
I'll tell you,

30
00:01:33,641 --> 00:01:35,350
man,
every time I looked at that whole pistol

31
00:01:35,351 --> 00:01:36,970
Emoji,
and this is no joke,

32
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:37,804
when I used to look at it,
it just filled me with a desire to go 

33
00:01:40,481 --> 00:01:42,370
shoot up a fucking shopping mall.

34
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:45,250
That Emoji,
so I'm glad they got rid of it.

35
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:46,263
Me.
It made me want to go back to the old 

36
00:01:47,111 --> 00:01:49,780
west.
I wanted to be like a cowboy.

37
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,790
Maybe if they had shopped,
wait,

38
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:52,211
wait,
wait,

39
00:01:52,211 --> 00:01:52,601
wait,
wait,

40
00:01:52,601 --> 00:01:53,021
wait,
wait,

41
00:01:53,021 --> 00:01:53,501
wait,
wait,

42
00:01:53,501 --> 00:01:53,921
wait,
wait,

43
00:01:53,921 --> 00:01:54,371
wait,
wait,

44
00:01:54,371 --> 00:01:55,204
wait,
wait.

45
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,133
Apple adds more gender diverse emojis in
Ios 10 please explain to us Google with 

46
00:02:01,911 --> 00:02:05,050
new Emoji to find the Waterpik and this 
is what came up first.

47
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:05,980
Yeah.
How dare you.

48
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:11,140
How dare you bring this up.
100 new and redesigned emoji characters,

49
00:02:11,141 --> 00:02:13,540
including no more guns,
but you know,

50
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:15,190
female,
female athletes.

51
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:16,410
Okay.
That's cool.

52
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,231
Cool.
Oh,

53
00:02:17,231 --> 00:02:19,120
so okay.
Gender diverse.

54
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:22,960
All right,
well we'll do high for the show.

55
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,730
I was thinking gender neutral.
Gender diversity does buttes.

56
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:30,040
Those are some sweet new emojis.
That's actually cool.

57
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:32,590
Nothing wrong with that.
Emojis are weird.

58
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,453
It's weird.
One like friends start sending you 

59
00:02:35,261 --> 00:02:39,340
emojis because like for the longest time
guys never sent Emoji.

60
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:41,140
No Way.
And now it's happening.

61
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,420
I love him man.
What a useful fucking thing.

62
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:47,560
That animated gifs and the emojis praise
God and heaven.

63
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,840
It's so great.
It saves so much time.

64
00:02:49,841 --> 00:02:53,260
It gets across so much more.
Language is so limited,

65
00:02:53,261 --> 00:02:54,210
man.
We have to like,

66
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:55,443
it really is.
I think we're going to hieroglyphs what 

67
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,830
do you eventually,
yeah,

68
00:02:59,831 --> 00:03:01,840
I think that's what these emojis are.
Yeah,

69
00:03:01,841 --> 00:03:02,674
right.
Yeah.

70
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,160
I think there are a modern version of 
hieroglyphs.

71
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,490
That's right.
Yeah.

72
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,480
They articulate so much,
you know,

73
00:03:08,481 --> 00:03:11,200
it's like very efficient form of 
language.

74
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,213
It just needs to get a little deeper so 
that the emojis are animated a little 

75
00:03:16,001 --> 00:03:16,834
bit so that they can,
you can sort of tune in the Emoji to 

76
00:03:19,841 --> 00:03:20,674
this specific thing you're trying to 
convey to somebody instead of just the 

77
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,890
smiley face,
which they have in the Apple Watch.

78
00:03:26,891 --> 00:03:30,640
You can like kind of like,
you can control it a little bit.

79
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,580
The Smiley face Emoji.
You just need to be able to dial it in a

80
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:38,230
little bit more.
Do you think by limiting like by keeping

81
00:03:38,231 --> 00:03:39,730
it more open ended,
right.

82
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,223
Like instead of having a bunch of like 
descriptives nouns and verbs and things 

83
00:03:44,621 --> 00:03:48,790
like that instead of that having more of
an open ended idea,

84
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,190
like a smiley face.
Yeah,

85
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:53,690
like a smiley face.
Uh,

86
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:55,720
and then knuckles,
which is like,

87
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,670
Yo give me some knuckles,
I'll see you later.

88
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:58,863
You know what I mean?
Like you can kind of like keep it in 

89
00:04:00,821 --> 00:04:01,654
this weird non undefined stay.
Like we both know what it is but it's 

90
00:04:06,161 --> 00:04:07,780
not,
it's not written anywhere.

91
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,793
Yeah.
And it relieves you of having to like 

92
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:15,010
compose some sentence.
Do I use an exclamation mark here?

93
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,260
Should I use a comma?
What do I need to say?

94
00:04:17,261 --> 00:04:19,540
I just want to get,
I'm going to see him in like 20 minutes.

95
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:22,870
It's way easier to do like an alien 
head,

96
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,560
a thumbs up,
and a smiley face that says everything.

97
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:27,663
It's fun to,
it's fun when someone sends you like an 

98
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:32,920
alien head and then a pile of shit,
you know,

99
00:04:32,921 --> 00:04:37,480
like what,
how do I decide?

100
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,550
But yeah,
it's a,

101
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:40,403
it's such a,
that's such a wonderful emerging 

102
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:46,180
language.
It just needs to get animated.

103
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:47,463
And you know,
the animated gifts are amazing for 

104
00:04:50,531 --> 00:04:51,364
really going deep into how you're 
feeling because some of them are 

105
00:04:53,411 --> 00:04:54,244
awesome.
Yeah,

106
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,710
they're fantastic.
They're fantastic.

107
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,230
It's so fun to send those things,
man.

108
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,360
Yeah,
it's memes.

109
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,673
I mean like Internet memes.
Really funny ones are really like a new 

110
00:05:07,751 --> 00:05:09,480
kind of comedy.
Yeah.

111
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,650
It's like a short,
it's like these are jokes.

112
00:05:11,651 --> 00:05:15,430
He's like punchlines,
but sometimes better than someone saying

113
00:05:15,431 --> 00:05:17,890
anything because you're seeing it.
Right.

114
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,170
Like a Thomson,
Aurora had one on his page today,

115
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:22,680
uh,
with this face and a,

116
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:23,523
it's a,
this is a popular one that keeps going 

117
00:05:24,671 --> 00:05:25,540
around.
Uh,

118
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:26,374
when you nut,
but she keeps sucking look at Thompson 

119
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,320
hours.
I mean,

120
00:05:32,321 --> 00:05:35,740
this is in no way saying that he 
invented this because this is,

121
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:40,750
I think he'd be the first admit he's,
he's piggy backing on a meme that we all

122
00:05:40,751 --> 00:05:41,584
know.
Right?

123
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:42,683
Right.
I don't know who wrote that first meme 

124
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:47,410
when you know,
and she keeps looking at his face,

125
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,060
look at his face.
Oh my God.

126
00:05:52,061 --> 00:05:54,340
It's hilarious.
But this,

127
00:05:54,341 --> 00:05:55,174
um,
this meme when you nut and she keeps 

128
00:05:56,521 --> 00:05:58,280
sucking,
there's like fucking

129
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,050
hundreds of them.
Have you seen them?

130
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,153
Like just google when you not and she 
keeps sucking and then go to images and 

131
00:06:04,761 --> 00:06:06,560
you'd be like,
oh my God,

132
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:08,810
there's so many.
Wow,

133
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:10,980
dude,
there's hundreds of these.

134
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:17,770
Wow.
I would like to know the percentage.

135
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,753
I'd like to know the percentage of 
people who have created these that have 

136
00:06:22,031 --> 00:06:27,031
never gotten a blow job.
I wonder what it is like 15 20%.

137
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:29,390
It's a good one.
It's superman was a good one.

138
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,960
It's funny because you can put that on 
phases all throughout history,

139
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:44,470
you know,
and there's also versions of it,

140
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,133
how you be when you bust.
But she keeps sucking or she's still 

141
00:06:50,931 --> 00:06:51,764
sucking.
This guy's playing the cello when you 

142
00:06:55,431 --> 00:06:57,110
finish,
but she keeps sucking.

143
00:06:58,210 --> 00:06:59,043
He did so many of them.
That might be like one of the most 

144
00:07:00,831 --> 00:07:02,760
persistent jokes currently on the 
Internet.

145
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:03,080
Oh my.
Yeah

146
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,300
guys.
A bill cosby one.

147
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:05,883
Oh look,
they've got the one at the Indian guy 

148
00:07:07,871 --> 00:07:09,910
died during a speech.
Had a stroke.

149
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,280
What?
Yeah.

150
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:13,150
That guy just died.
Oh,

151
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,800
I saw them on the Internet.
Is that what happened?

152
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:15,570
Yeah,
he had,

153
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:17,530
he had a stroke as he was speaking.
Yes.

154
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,000
Oh,
see,

155
00:07:19,001 --> 00:07:19,834
look.
You can look right before and that will 

156
00:07:20,861 --> 00:07:22,960
in the related images.
Wow.

157
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,690
It's incredible.
Right before in the universe.

158
00:07:25,691 --> 00:07:29,230
Out of the universe and out.
He died right there.

159
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:29,981
Yeah.
I think,

160
00:07:29,981 --> 00:07:30,814
well,
I mean it depends on how you define 

161
00:07:32,081 --> 00:07:32,914
death.
Yup.

162
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:36,070
Bye.
Outta here.

163
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:36,933
The bezdecki crazy best death.
That's one of the best deaths you're 

164
00:07:40,481 --> 00:07:42,040
witnessing.
Like he said,

165
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:42,933
he just made a great point that he 
thinks it's kind of funny and then he 

166
00:07:45,401 --> 00:07:46,450
dies.
God,

167
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,100
wow.
Bless it.

168
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:53,101
Exit from this incarnation.
That is a crazy image.

169
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:56,720
Yeah.
Um,

170
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,480
who is that guy?
Do you know who he is?

171
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:00,850
Nope.
Hmm.

172
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:02,590
How'd you find him,
Jamie?

173
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,450
Just from the stack.
Yeah.

174
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,900
That's a crazy story.
Who like,

175
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:11,170
it's so funny,
when he died he guaranteed did not think

176
00:08:11,171 --> 00:08:13,660
you would land in a,
when you not in chic.

177
00:08:13,661 --> 00:08:14,494
It keeps me in the power of his death 
that he would shatter into a million 

178
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:22,450
things.
And one of them is a meme.

179
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,370
Well,
here's the thing about these memes.

180
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,890
There's guys who are like meme artists

181
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:29,600
and they're really,
really funny.

182
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,040
And then there's also people that,
that

183
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:36,550
they kinda like Carlos man see a memes.
Oh yeah,

184
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,393
no,
I probably should stop using that guys 

185
00:08:38,331 --> 00:08:39,560
name like that.
It's rude,

186
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,100
but it's really sad as everyone knows 
that that means.

187
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,750
Yeah.
When you,

188
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:48,650
there was just someone just tweeted 
that,

189
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,940
uh,
there's a,

190
00:08:49,941 --> 00:08:54,680
there's a product in the UK that stole 
Mitch Hedberg Joke.

191
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:58,050
It's a product that has just written in 
the bag.

192
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,300
His joke,
like when you want to eat rice ice,

193
00:09:00,301 --> 00:09:03,120
when you want to eat 2000 of the same 
things or whatever.

194
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,610
They like just pop that right in the 
back.

195
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:06,444
But they didn't credit him.
They credited the name of their mascot 

196
00:09:10,561 --> 00:09:11,820
for the company.
Well,

197
00:09:11,821 --> 00:09:14,310
let's,
it's a problem with memes because people

198
00:09:14,311 --> 00:09:15,144
do it all the time.
Like there's people that have pages 

199
00:09:16,561 --> 00:09:20,910
where they're all their memes or someone
else's that they don't give credit for,

200
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:21,803
right.
And then they get caught and then they 

201
00:09:22,951 --> 00:09:24,980
have to start re,
you know,

202
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,040
retweeting stuff.

203
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,620
But sometimes you retweet the wrong 
person,

204
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:29,623
know you,
you retweet someone who just copied it 

205
00:09:31,921 --> 00:09:32,754
from somebody else.
Yeah.

206
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:36,810
I've had that happen more than once.
You don't know,

207
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:38,700
but they're funny.
So it's like what do you do?

208
00:09:38,701 --> 00:09:39,534
Do you just retweet it because you think
it's funny and you laugh or should you 

209
00:09:42,211 --> 00:09:45,180
hold onto it until you can find 
ownership of the meme?

210
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,350
Yeah,
I mean,

211
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:48,240
I took good question,
right?

212
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:52,410
I think if you can give credit,
give credit,

213
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:56,070
but if we spend too much time getting 
caught up in meme distribution,

214
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:59,310
then we're going to lose what is so 
beautiful about the thing,

215
00:09:59,311 --> 00:10:00,144
which is that I create some meme,
upload it to the Internet and it either 

216
00:10:04,801 --> 00:10:05,634
like just molders on injure or whatever,
or it just scatters and a trillion 

217
00:10:10,591 --> 00:10:11,424
pieces everywhere.
There's something really cool and 

218
00:10:13,741 --> 00:10:17,220
beautiful in that.
And I don't think meme transmitters are,

219
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:18,390
are thieves.

220
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,253
Mostly there's just a few scumbags who 
take people shit and don't credit them 

221
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,223
and then they get punished.
Usually they get punished by the 

222
00:10:27,481 --> 00:10:29,370
Internet.
Well severely.

223
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,833
Absolutely.
But there have been a bunch of people 

224
00:10:32,881 --> 00:10:34,890
that have done it and they're now make 
money off of it.

225
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:35,710
Yeah.
That,

226
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:36,543
that's where it gets weird because 
there's a bunch of people that are just 

227
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:39,204
really funny and maybe they're 
introverts and they never were really 

228
00:10:42,481 --> 00:10:44,900
good at cracking jokes socially cause 
they're,

229
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,800
they're nervous,
but they're funny.

230
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,240
They have a funny mine.
Yes.

231
00:10:48,241 --> 00:10:51,870
And so this is a form of joke writing 
and joke telling.

232
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:54,120
Yeah,
a really good one too.

233
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:59,390
So somebody had to be the first person 
to come up with when she,

234
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,950
you know when you come.
But she keeps sucking.

235
00:11:01,951 --> 00:11:02,784
Someone has to be.
So this is like this massive plagiarism 

236
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,810
that we're all laughing at.

237
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,310
Yeah.
But you know,

238
00:11:08,311 --> 00:11:09,660
is that what it is?
I don't think,

239
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:14,430
I mean how do you like that guy deserves
credit cause he is funny.

240
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,300
Right?
The guy who invented it burst.

241
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,870
That's a funny guy.
Like that was a good idea.

242
00:11:18,871 --> 00:11:21,630
It's funny he does.
He definitely deserves credit for it.

243
00:11:21,631 --> 00:11:22,464
So I know what you're saying.
But then eventually you're going to 

244
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,260
like,
I guess you can watermark your meme,

245
00:11:28,261 --> 00:11:29,094
right?
He could have watermark that you see 

246
00:11:30,571 --> 00:11:31,404
that sometimes but eventually the 
watermark is going to get taken off 

247
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,600
cause you know your people were putting 
in new picks.

248
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,010
Well yeah,
I mean live.

249
00:11:38,011 --> 00:11:40,920
The second one is there's hundreds of 
different images.

250
00:11:40,921 --> 00:11:41,754
So like you could never watermark that.
And what's very funny about it is 

251
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:49,041
they'll take the word com for example,
there was a first human who for whatever

252
00:11:50,011 --> 00:11:53,980
reason decided to call his ejaculations 
calm.

253
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,350
He just decided on who the fuck was that
guy.

254
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:57,493
There is first.
That's a huge point because it's 

255
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:01,300
universal.
It's universal.

256
00:12:01,301 --> 00:12:05,560
Yeah.
How do you trace it back?

257
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,513
I mean,
every single word that a human being 

258
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,664
uses,
theoretically you could follow it 

259
00:12:11,411 --> 00:12:12,244
backwards through time in the same way 
you follow any organic life form you 

260
00:12:16,031 --> 00:12:17,110
can,
it's called atomology.

261
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:17,944
You can look at the weird a way that 
language mutates over time and you know 

262
00:12:22,761 --> 00:12:25,690
that it's somewhere way,
way back in the back of the line,

263
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:30,820
there had to be somebody who's like,
we'll call it a mountain or whatever.

264
00:12:30,821 --> 00:12:33,940
The precursor term for mountain was 
somebody who was like,

265
00:12:33,941 --> 00:12:36,730
it's a hood that someone does that,
right?

266
00:12:36,731 --> 00:12:38,910
It has to,
has to someone.

267
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,083
So

268
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:44,750
isn't that the idea that one point in 
time we all had a universal language,

269
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,630
but it became a giant issue because 
people were sort of conspiring and yeah,

270
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:50,763
they were talking too much.
So one of the ways that God has 

271
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,460
separated us,
I might be butchering this.

272
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:57,040
You're talking about the Tower of Babel?
Yeah.

273
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:57,943
Yeah.
They wanted to construct a coward or 

274
00:13:00,111 --> 00:13:04,460
each heaven and God was I guess like 
fuck that.

275
00:13:04,461 --> 00:13:06,620
It's like when ants get in your house or
whatever,

276
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:09,870
they're getting too advanced.
Do you think that's a reverse engine

277
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:10,743
mirrored idea?
Like do you think that someone who may 

278
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:15,084
be has experienced like brief moments of
human potential and realized like w 

279
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,420
we're missing out on what people are 
capable of?

280
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:23,640
There's gotta be a way where we could 
all come together.

281
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,090
Excuse me.
But when there's people from one country

282
00:13:27,091 --> 00:13:27,924
like Japan and they're arguing with 
someone from Germany and how much of 

283
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:34,260
what the fuck each person is saying is 
even getting through,

284
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:36,300
you know,
I mean you're having translators.

285
00:13:36,301 --> 00:13:37,680
You were supposed to be going to war 
with people.

286
00:13:37,681 --> 00:13:38,970
You don't even understand what they're 
saying.

287
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:40,230
Right.
Imagine that.

288
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:40,891
Yeah,
we've,

289
00:13:40,891 --> 00:13:44,340
we get all speak to each other and we 
all could speak one language.

290
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:45,360
What happened?
Well,

291
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:48,930
I mean,
isn't that like maybe what that tower of

292
00:13:48,931 --> 00:13:51,600
Babel is all about?
Sort of like a reverse engineered,

293
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,170
like almost saying like the imagine the 
power,

294
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:56,423
the God like power people could have if 
they get all openly and honestly 

295
00:13:59,611 --> 00:14:04,020
communicate with each other freely and 
ex experience this idea that we're not,

296
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:05,123
we're not,
you're not my enemy because you were 

297
00:14:06,511 --> 00:14:07,850
born over there.
Right.

298
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:08,763
This is nonsense.
This is some crazy old shit that we 

299
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:11,934
should have abandoned.

300
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,890
I'm a go,
you are looking in the Bible.

301
00:14:14,891 --> 00:14:17,680
Those stories.
One thing that I just did,

302
00:14:17,681 --> 00:14:20,500
I'm so glad you brought this up just for
fun.

303
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:24,670
Uh,
one of my favorite in the New Testament,

304
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,513
my favorite Gospel is the book of John 
in the very beginning of the book of 

305
00:14:28,151 --> 00:14:30,340
John is some of the trippiest shit 
you'll ever read.

306
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:34,930
But I went back to that and so I did a 
find and replace,

307
00:14:34,931 --> 00:14:37,180
anyone can do this.
It's so cool.

308
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:41,470
Find and replace the word God with the 
programmer.

309
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:46,090
And then you can start replacing words 
with modern day,

310
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:50,200
a simulation theory ideas.
So you know,

311
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,880
um,
when it talks about Jesus,

312
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:58,390
it's like he was sent into the 
simulation to bring an upgrade and those

313
00:15:01,011 --> 00:15:04,370
that accepted the upgrade would be 
children of the programmer.

314
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:09,310
You start doing that and suddenly you 
look at this like amazing.

315
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,910
It gets really trippy,
right?

316
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:11,743
So when you talk about the Tower of 
Babel and you look at it from the 

317
00:15:14,571 --> 00:15:15,404
perspective of this is a simulation 
being run by some intelligent creator 

318
00:15:19,761 --> 00:15:20,680
force,
right?

319
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:23,420
So you see again and again,
well not again and again,

320
00:15:23,421 --> 00:15:24,254
but right now I can think of two times 
where the programmer looks at the 

321
00:15:28,071 --> 00:15:28,910
simulation.
It's like,

322
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:31,340
Oh shit,
they're about to wake up.

323
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:32,623
Like the same way the Ilan musk is 
worried about ai becoming too powerful 

324
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:37,423
in the Bible of the programmer gets 
really fucking uncomfortable when the 

325
00:15:41,271 --> 00:15:42,104
simulation appears to be gaining too 
much power and has to like shift the 

326
00:15:46,761 --> 00:15:50,030
programming a little bit because there 
appears to be some kind of,

327
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:51,223
in the mythology of the Bible,
there seems to be a recurring 

328
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,413
nervousness that the sim,
the programmer gets when it seems like 

329
00:15:59,811 --> 00:16:03,980
the simulation is about to reach some 
certain level of power awareness.

330
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,220
This is in the book of Genesis.
They say,

331
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,253
you know,
they ate of the tree of knowledge of 

332
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:09,734
good and evil,
gain self awareness and there was 

333
00:16:11,391 --> 00:16:14,750
another tree they weren't supposed to 
eat from the tree of life.

334
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:19,070
And the uh,
God says it's weird because in the Quran

335
00:16:19,071 --> 00:16:21,890
and in the Bible,
God ref,

336
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:25,850
it's referred to as the plural rather 
than the singular.

337
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:28,100
So God doesn't,
the versus something like,

338
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,100
you know,
if they eat from the tree of life,

339
00:16:31,101 --> 00:16:33,260
they will become like us,
right?

340
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:34,910
Not like,
like us.

341
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:37,790
So there's like a,
we can't keep these.

342
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:38,624
We have to keep these beings somewhat 
curtailed because we don't know what 

343
00:16:43,011 --> 00:16:45,890
they're going to do if they gain too 
much power.

344
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:46,873
That's in the mythology of the thing and
it kind of works from the simulation 

345
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:50,624
theory perspective.
If we're a simulation that's on the 

346
00:16:53,031 --> 00:16:53,864
precipice of a kind of singularity,
which would be the simulation somehow 

347
00:16:57,711 --> 00:17:00,620
becoming self aware,
then for whatever reason,

348
00:17:00,621 --> 00:17:01,454
whoever's running the show doesn't want 
that to happen or hasn't wanted it to 

349
00:17:04,101 --> 00:17:06,770
happen throughout time,
you know?

350
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:08,423
Well it's also if you're talking about 
like eating from the tree of life and 

351
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,410
becoming like them,
uh,

352
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,493
I mean that is about a psychedelic as 
you can get your literally talked about 

353
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:21,570
eating something and becoming a god.
Yeah.

354
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,040
You're talking about eating from the 
tree.

355
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:24,630
Like what is the tree of life?
Everybody's like,

356
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,950
oh,
whatever.

357
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:27,480
Yeah,
whatever.

358
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,680
It's history.
It's,

359
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:29,880
you know what,
God,

360
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:31,920
there was trees back then.
Sure.

361
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,800
If you're a literal believer,
the Bible,

362
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:39,000
you have to think that there was not 
just an experience where God showed up.

363
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,650
Right?
Not just this,

364
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:41,663
this,
this thing that happened where God came 

365
00:17:43,621 --> 00:17:44,760
down,
he spoke to you an elevator,

366
00:17:44,761 --> 00:17:45,594
you know,
you're saying people shouldn't eat from 

367
00:17:48,331 --> 00:17:49,430
a tree.
Oh yeah.

368
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,480
Cause they could become a god.
Yeah.

369
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:56,510
I mean that's kind of where if you're 
translating stuff from ancient Hebrew to

370
00:17:56,761 --> 00:17:57,594
Greek to Latin into,
to all these different languages to 

371
00:18:00,211 --> 00:18:01,560
English,
you know,

372
00:18:01,561 --> 00:18:03,880
that there's some weird shit being lost 
along the way.

373
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:05,610
In one of them was probably calling it a
tree.

374
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:06,653
Right?
Because we didn't even know there's a 

375
00:18:08,701 --> 00:18:11,340
fucking amazing radio lab out.
It's out.

376
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,770
It's out right now.
It's about,

377
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,180
um,
about trees and the,

378
00:18:16,181 --> 00:18:17,014
the intelligence of trees and that trees
communicate and that they share 

379
00:18:19,831 --> 00:18:23,710
resources that they allocate resources 
toward the needier ones.

380
00:18:23,711 --> 00:18:27,480
Yeah.
They have this interaction with fungus,

381
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:32,520
this symbiotic relationship with fungus.
It is fucking incredible man.

382
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:33,383
Where the fungus are eating these 
microscopic bugs and getting their 

383
00:18:37,471 --> 00:18:38,304
nutrients from these microscopic bugs 
and that's where the trees are getting 

384
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:43,770
their nutrients from.
And some of them get him from,

385
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,840
from salmon.
There's trees that were like,

386
00:18:45,841 --> 00:18:46,674
they got 70% of their nitrogen from 
salmon because bears would eat under 

387
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:53,280
these trees.
They would eat and they would leave like

388
00:18:53,281 --> 00:18:54,114
fish heads under the trees and like the 
bears would continue to return to the 

389
00:18:57,071 --> 00:19:00,600
same trees and these trees would eat the
fucking fish,

390
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:01,520
the,
the,

391
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,353
the,
the fungus inside their soil and the 

392
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:06,660
Miko rise will relationship that they 
have.

393
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:07,523
It's amazing man.
It's amazing dude there if their old 

394
00:19:10,381 --> 00:19:13,450
life form that we are sleeping on.
Yeah.

395
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,633
This plants like,
and this is not a dig against anybody 

396
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:22,260
who's a vegetarian or anyone on the 
other end of the spectrum that only eats

397
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:24,990
meat.
Take the ideologies out.

398
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:25,853
Like,
cause everybody knows that I meet or 

399
00:19:27,571 --> 00:19:29,670
everybody that listens to this podcast 
and I,

400
00:19:29,671 --> 00:19:30,504
I've had issues with people for that or 
proselytizing vegans and I understand 

401
00:19:34,501 --> 00:19:35,334
that you're doing it for a good reason,
then you're doing it for the right 

402
00:19:38,341 --> 00:19:39,150
purposes.
And I'm,

403
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:41,850
I'm happy for everybody that that is 
living their life that way.

404
00:19:41,851 --> 00:19:43,860
If you're enjoying it and you're 
healthy,

405
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,350
let's all just let that go.
Just look at this for a second.

406
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:52,730
Forget about what you're eating.
What plants are is some strange,

407
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:57,060
intelligent network of organisms.
And when I say intelligent,

408
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,580
I don't say it can fucking do math.

409
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:04,740
I'm not saying it can send emails and 
create fucking moon rockets,

410
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,860
but they communicate with each other.
There's something going on.

411
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:09,390
They don't need to do all those other 
things.

412
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,433
We defined intelligence far too 
frequently by what we have created and 

413
00:20:14,641 --> 00:20:15,474
what what we can do with our fingers and
when our mouths and with our ability to 

414
00:20:18,991 --> 00:20:23,310
communicate with each other audibly and 
in a manner where I'm talking and you're

415
00:20:23,311 --> 00:20:26,580
hearing and we don't respect other forms
of communication because this,

416
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:29,700
we're so attached to our idea of what 
communicating is.

417
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:30,683
We're ignoring some really basic shit 
with how these plants and these fungi 

418
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:38,250
communicate with each other.
They're there.

419
00:20:38,251 --> 00:20:39,690
Fuck.
They're not just communicating with each

420
00:20:39,691 --> 00:20:40,860
other.
They're sending signals.

421
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,053
If one of them is getting eaten,
they're sending signals through the air 

422
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:46,950
and it's forcing the other plants to 
change the,

423
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:47,883
they taste

424
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:51,130
to discourage predation.
They're communicating when they're hurt.

425
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:52,163
Wow.
Do the allocate resources to more needy 

426
00:20:54,701 --> 00:20:55,534
plants.
They find out who in the network is 

427
00:20:56,861 --> 00:20:59,350
needy and the allocate resources.
This,

428
00:20:59,351 --> 00:21:02,770
this radio radiolab is fast and that's 
cool man.

429
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:06,250
They share resources with these microbes
or with uh,

430
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:09,430
with these fungus you and also you,
cause you were saying,

431
00:21:09,431 --> 00:21:12,400
well they can't send emails,
but if you look at,

432
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:13,743
I mean,
and you separated the human biome 

433
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:20,050
somehow from the plant kingdom,
which you can't do,

434
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:25,320
we're completely connected to the plant 
kingdom because we need oxygen to live.

435
00:21:25,721 --> 00:21:26,554
So we are deeply,
deeply woven into that fabric of 

436
00:21:30,821 --> 00:21:31,654
intelligence that you're talking about 
to the point that we actually kind of 

437
00:21:33,911 --> 00:21:38,911
grow out of that fabric of intelligence 
because we have a symbiotic relationship

438
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,140
with plants,
uh,

439
00:21:41,141 --> 00:21:44,980
just to exist on planet earth.
So you're talking about,

440
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,830
uh,
the what is called,

441
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,560
have you heard of the web of Indra?

442
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:51,903
No,
the web of injury or it's also called 

443
00:21:53,711 --> 00:21:57,080
the net of Indra or the web of Indra.
What does his from a,

444
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:57,943
this is hinduism.
So the idea is that a way to explain 

445
00:22:01,391 --> 00:22:05,290
this sort of inner connectedness,
connectedness of all things is this like

446
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,513
imagine like a web or a net where at 
every single nexus point there is a 

447
00:22:12,131 --> 00:22:14,530
jewel,
the jewel dinette avenger.

448
00:22:14,531 --> 00:22:16,030
That's what it's called.
So then,

449
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:21,190
uh,
now imagine that every creature on earth

450
00:22:21,191 --> 00:22:25,120
are in this universe that has any kind 
of sentence at all,

451
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:29,680
composes a tiny little jewel on this 
net.

452
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:30,813
And so this net is every joule is 
connected via like whatever connects us 

453
00:22:35,741 --> 00:22:39,820
to plants.
Everything is connected that's alive it,

454
00:22:39,821 --> 00:22:40,654
which means that any slight movement in 
any of these jewels creates a vibration 

455
00:22:46,931 --> 00:22:47,764
that rolls through infinity through the 
entire net of Indra affecting all o 

456
00:22:52,061 --> 00:22:54,340
other sentient beings in some small way.

457
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:58,500
It's basically the idea is any third is 
the jewel net avenger.

458
00:22:58,930 --> 00:22:59,763
So anything that you do,
it gets sort of vibrated through the 

459
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:03,214
rest of the thing.
Anything that happens in the micro 

460
00:23:05,291 --> 00:23:08,650
happens in the macro,
macro happens in the micro.

461
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:10,540
It's a beautiful idea,
man.

462
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:11,341
And,
and,

463
00:23:11,341 --> 00:23:16,341
and it seems like this new discovery 
that's come out about plants has a,

464
00:23:16,961 --> 00:23:17,794
in some way really shined,
shone a light on the complexity of that 

465
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,620
incredible net.
You know,

466
00:23:23,621 --> 00:23:24,454
cause it's so complex because then it 
gets down to probably the quantum level 

467
00:23:28,271 --> 00:23:28,811
too.
I mean,

468
00:23:28,811 --> 00:23:29,644
if you think of the quantum reactions 
happening inside the plants to create 

469
00:23:34,481 --> 00:23:35,314
these biochemical shifts,
it's startling when you imagine all the 

470
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:39,874
weird chemical and atomic movement 
that's happening inside of the thing 

471
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:45,124
itself.
It's overwhelmingly beautiful and hard 

472
00:23:47,901 --> 00:23:50,630
to imagine that we get to be a piece of 
it,

473
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:51,560
which is pretty cool.

474
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:54,020
But the plants are sending email,
you know,

475
00:23:54,021 --> 00:23:57,110
because we are the plants,
the plants are us,

476
00:23:57,111 --> 00:24:00,300
the plants are affecting rumor.
Mccann always talked about x.

477
00:24:00,301 --> 00:24:03,470
So pheromones,
remember that Xcel pheromones,

478
00:24:03,471 --> 00:24:04,304
you'd say that mirror that plants have 
pheromones that they put out to like 

479
00:24:08,151 --> 00:24:09,920
what you're saying to discourage 
predation.

480
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,800
Bring in bees.
I liked that.

481
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:14,120
I said per day session,
like I'm smart,

482
00:24:14,121 --> 00:24:16,130
but it's a great word.
But the um,

483
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,510
uh,
so,

484
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:18,613
uh,
he would say that psychedelics 

485
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:22,730
marijuana,
dmt,

486
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,840
these are Xo pheromones from the 
vegetable world.

487
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:31,270
I gained deal on mckinna impression,
but these are x o pheromones coming into

488
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,113
our biome and shifting our consciousness
in a way to try to manipulate our 

489
00:24:36,261 --> 00:24:37,960
behavior a little bit.
And,

490
00:24:37,961 --> 00:24:39,890
and also,
you know,

491
00:24:39,891 --> 00:24:42,740
all this stuff coming out of the gut 
biome to like,

492
00:24:42,741 --> 00:24:43,574
not only is there this flourishing 
vegetable kingdom that is like clearly 

493
00:24:47,271 --> 00:24:49,520
alive and has its own alien 
intelligence,

494
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:50,653
but we've got fucking gut biomes filled 
with these bacteria that could 

495
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,680
theoretically be controlling our 
cravings,

496
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,753
right?
So we're being manipulated by these 

497
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:08,090
colonies of alien beings living in our 
guts,

498
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:11,180
telling us,
get another fucking candy bar,

499
00:25:11,181 --> 00:25:12,470
man.
Wouldn't it be good?

500
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,390
Isn't that cool?
So true.

501
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:16,010
Yeah.
It's so true.

502
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:19,370
There's this darkness inside.
You then want that sugar.

503
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:20,253
Yeah.
It's a little demon little demon that 

504
00:25:21,291 --> 00:25:22,310
feeds off sugar.
Well,

505
00:25:22,311 --> 00:25:25,130
it's a modern,
it's a modern,

506
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,260
it's a modern way of saying demonic 
possession.

507
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,160
And the old days you'd be like,
you got a demon motherfucker.

508
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,131
Now it's like,
well,

509
00:25:31,131 --> 00:25:35,390
your gut biome is craving carbohydrates 
to survive.

510
00:25:35,391 --> 00:25:36,500
Look,
if you've got the plague,

511
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:38,840
how's that any different than you being 
attacked by Vampires,

512
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,810
right?
Something's trying to kill you.

513
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:41,773
We take comfort in the idea that it's 
some microscopic thing that we can even 

514
00:25:44,361 --> 00:25:45,194
see because that makes you feel better.
That's looks a lot weirder than a 

515
00:25:47,961 --> 00:25:50,060
fucking vampire by the way.
A lot

516
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,060
weirder.
It's not a,

517
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,480
it's not a well dressed man with a cape 
and things.

518
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,553
You're looking at some kind of strange 
globular transforming bit of plasma 

519
00:26:01,321 --> 00:26:04,330
that's swimming around inside of you

520
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:07,550
actively trying to destroy you.
He came,

521
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:11,260
he came to see it.
We didn't even find them to like what,

522
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:12,970
when,
when did they invent microscopes?

523
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,340
If you had a gas?
18 hundreds I couldn't guess that.

524
00:26:15,341 --> 00:26:17,710
And that's a sad thing man.
I couldn't guess that.

525
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,210
Let me,
I'm going to guess.

526
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:24,720
I think Brian Cowen was talking about 
this in relationship to them discovering

527
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:26,920
bacteria with surgery.
Oh No,

528
00:26:26,921 --> 00:26:28,480
it was Chris.
I think it was Chris Ryan.

529
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:30,430
I think Chris Ryan might've been the 
first one.

530
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:32,380
I don't remember.
I'm now I'm giving people credit.

531
00:26:32,381 --> 00:26:33,850
I'm not sure.
But um,

532
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,713
the idea was that they didn't know what,
what bacteria was for like a long time 

533
00:26:39,101 --> 00:26:39,934
and they didn't wash their hands.
And people die of horrible infections 

534
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:43,920
when they were to do

535
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,390
surgery on people.
It's like,

536
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:47,580
Oh fuck the guy.
So this is,

537
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:50,520
I can't remember the guy's name.
You may be confined to Jamie.

538
00:26:50,521 --> 00:26:55,521
It's the guy he was,
he realized so doctors would apparently,

539
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:57,683
uh,
they would like do autopsies on corpses 

540
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:01,970
to try to understand how the human body 
worked.

541
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:02,813
It used to be illegal.
I was like a big deal to cut open a 

542
00:27:04,111 --> 00:27:04,944
corpse says doctors are studying corpses
and apparently they didn't know you 

543
00:27:07,801 --> 00:27:11,050
should wash your hands after you handle 
a Corp.

544
00:27:11,051 --> 00:27:16,051
So you would like fuck around with a 
corpse and then go deliver a baby.

545
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:17,970
Right.
And,

546
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:18,803
and the babies,
there was a very high infant mortality 

547
00:27:21,091 --> 00:27:22,170
rate,
so I can't remember his name,

548
00:27:22,171 --> 00:27:24,390
but a doctor discovered,
oh wow.

549
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,433
Mind blowing idea.
You should wash your hands before you 

550
00:27:28,441 --> 00:27:30,870
deliver a baby.
And there it is.

551
00:27:30,871 --> 00:27:31,704
Yeah.
He ended up in a fucking mental asylum 

552
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:37,830
because they weren't listening to him.
And uh,

553
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,440
apparently what doctor said,
gentlemen,

554
00:27:40,441 --> 00:27:43,160
do not need to wash their hands.
Oh my God.

555
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:44,550
Yeah.
A gentleman,

556
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:48,120
a gentleman does not wash his hands 
because they're just innately clean.

557
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,290
Mm.
So yeah,

558
00:27:49,291 --> 00:27:50,370
man,
people had no idea.

559
00:27:50,371 --> 00:27:53,910
They thought that your com was filled 
with tiny little men,

560
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:56,040
you know,
like little humans were in.

561
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:57,600
They're like tiny little,
yeah.

562
00:27:57,930 --> 00:27:59,700
Yeah.
Why did they think that until,

563
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:00,953
until the microscope,
I imagine until finally someone fucking 

564
00:28:03,421 --> 00:28:04,140
came on.
Yeah.

565
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:04,973
Microscopy.

566
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,273
How long after the invention of the 
microscope is someone shoot a load on 

567
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:15,410
one?
Exactly.

568
00:28:16,331 --> 00:28:19,930
However long it took to reach orgasm 
after building it?

569
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,793
Well,
it's like we were talking about virtual 

570
00:28:21,371 --> 00:28:22,300
reality.
We're like,

571
00:28:22,301 --> 00:28:27,301
how long before they made a porn?
I mean when the moment they came up with

572
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,550
Oculus,
we,

573
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:29,710
we knew.
Yeah,

574
00:28:29,711 --> 00:28:31,090
I think it's a matter of time.
Yeah.

575
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:34,020
Matter of time.
And they did it and they did it.

576
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:38,923
Oh,
it is going to create some fucking 

577
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:43,123
hilarious earthquakes and a lot of 
different relationships and marriages 

578
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:54,430
because people are going to have to 
define whether or not fucking a Hologram

579
00:28:57,470 --> 00:29:01,160
is a form of infidelity.
Like you're going to have to make a rule

580
00:29:01,161 --> 00:29:05,030
for that and in your relationship,
is it okay to fuck a Hologram?

581
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,370
Not Alive,
not a person,

582
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,820
but looks like it's fucking you looking 
you right in the eyes,

583
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:16,030
right in the fucking eyes.
Oh my God,

584
00:29:18,891 --> 00:29:19,700
Dude.
Yeah.

585
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:23,450
It's pretty weird because your brain,
when a Hologram is looking at you in the

586
00:29:23,451 --> 00:29:27,470
eyes in a loving way,
your brain doesn't reject it.

587
00:29:27,471 --> 00:29:28,430
It's like,
oh wow.

588
00:29:28,431 --> 00:29:30,170
I think this girl really likes me.
Oh wait,

589
00:29:30,171 --> 00:29:31,004
it's a hologram.
But in one millisecond you get this 

590
00:29:33,381 --> 00:29:37,550
feeling of like strange connection,
which is a,

591
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:38,623
and again,
we're in the most rudimentary parts of 

592
00:29:40,371 --> 00:29:42,310
Vr,
only apparently only.

593
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:44,440
I just read this,
it might've been a dated article,

594
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:45,663
but only 100,000
people or so own an htc vive if that's 

595
00:29:49,301 --> 00:29:51,160
drastically off you guys.
I'm sorry,

596
00:29:51,161 --> 00:29:54,400
but not a lot of people have vr goggles 
right now.

597
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,473
So not a lot of people.
And there's a lot of us who are fucking 

598
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:03,780
ear beating people at parties who had 
clearly just don't want to hear about it

599
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:06,280
any more than you want to hear about 
someone talking about it dream.

600
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:07,503
But there's a huge group of people right
now that are having some of the most 

601
00:30:10,301 --> 00:30:11,134
psychedelic mind bending experiences 
through technology and they can't even 

602
00:30:15,641 --> 00:30:19,090
talk about it or describe it to people 
because when you describe it,

603
00:30:19,091 --> 00:30:21,340
it's like you're talking about a dream,
but you're like,

604
00:30:21,341 --> 00:30:22,174
no,
this is happening to a lot of us right 

605
00:30:24,281 --> 00:30:25,114
now.
We're going into alternate dimensions 

606
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:31,120
via technology and hanging out there,
enjoying it,

607
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:34,570
experiencing the freedom,
uh,

608
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:35,463
from the confines of being constantly in
an infinitely located in whatever 

609
00:30:42,251 --> 00:30:43,084
physical space your body happens to be 
inhabiting to suddenly remove that 

610
00:30:46,751 --> 00:30:51,751
weights and how I can pop these things 
on and instantly translocate to some art

611
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:56,230
universe that some geniuses created.

612
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:58,600
Fuck around.
Shoot Arrows,

613
00:30:58,780 --> 00:30:59,613
wander through minecraft,
have sex with two girls who I always 

614
00:31:03,941 --> 00:31:06,790
apparently going to throw out of my 
house if they didn't fuck me.

615
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:08,570
That's what the point is.
I have,

616
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:13,330
which by the way,
never do that.

617
00:31:13,331 --> 00:31:15,680
But in this universe,
I guess that's what I go.

618
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:18,370
Yeah,
so the kind of rapey what?

619
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,900
It's not rapey.
It's just like,

620
00:31:19,901 --> 00:31:21,400
please,
I don't have money for the rent.

621
00:31:21,401 --> 00:31:23,260
Can I suck your Dick?
Oh,

622
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:24,880
you know,
it's her idea.

623
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:27,190
Oh yeah.
You're not saying you're not raping her.

624
00:31:27,191 --> 00:31:28,150
It's not like,
look,

625
00:31:28,151 --> 00:31:30,010
you gotta you gotta give up some posts 
the other,

626
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:30,863
otherwise I'm kicking you in the street.
You could say it if you want into the 

627
00:31:32,981 --> 00:31:33,701
porn.
I mean,

628
00:31:33,701 --> 00:31:35,420
you could say whatever you want.
Wait a minute.

629
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:37,690
You told me you have a microphone,
a microphone,

630
00:31:37,691 --> 00:31:39,640
but you can talk to it if you want to be
a Weirdo,

631
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:42,070
but okay.

632
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:44,180
How long before you can talk to it?
Hello?

633
00:31:44,181 --> 00:31:45,190
Four.
It talks back to you.

634
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:48,190
Well that's you're going to look,
you're looking at like a,

635
00:31:48,191 --> 00:31:53,191
so we got to figure out a way to either,
I mean I imagine that probably exists in

636
00:31:54,101 --> 00:31:58,270
some rudimentary way for some kind of 
CGI style porn,

637
00:31:58,271 --> 00:32:02,920
but to be able to like instantaneously 
communicate with live video porn,

638
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:06,520
you're going to need some kind of ai 
that I don't think we probably have just

639
00:32:06,521 --> 00:32:08,470
yet or we are probably on the PR,
but yes,

640
00:32:08,471 --> 00:32:10,000
that will ask come.
Oh,

641
00:32:10,001 --> 00:32:10,834
that's definitely going to happen.
I've watched x Mckenna again on a plane 

642
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,390
the other day.
I watched it for the second time.

643
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,350
That's cool.
It was just as good the second time.

644
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:19,630
That movie freaks me out,
man.

645
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:20,913
Why?
Because the girl's so beautiful and 

646
00:32:22,721 --> 00:32:24,970
she's so,
she's so attractive.

647
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,141
Like you,
you know,

648
00:32:26,141 --> 00:32:30,580
that guy you could see as much as he 
knew that she was a robot.

649
00:32:30,581 --> 00:32:33,550
As much as he knew that he wasn't a 
robot,

650
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,680
as much as he knew that she was 
artificial,

651
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:40,100
he was in love with her and she was 
amazing and it like she cared about

652
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,230
him and when she was talking to him for 
real,

653
00:32:42,231 --> 00:32:44,210
like when the lights went out and the 
camera was down,

654
00:32:44,211 --> 00:32:45,830
spoiler alert,
and she was like,

655
00:32:45,831 --> 00:32:47,270
don't trust him.
I'm like,

656
00:32:47,271 --> 00:32:49,490
this is like a real person,
a real person.

657
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,290
She's thinking like a person.
It's a person.

658
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:52,143
Yeah.
And he's like completely locked into 

659
00:32:53,601 --> 00:32:55,940
this idea that it's a person he's hipped
and tie.

660
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:57,890
It's a person.
I mean I don't,

661
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:01,820
this whole distinction between 
artificial intelligence and intelligence

662
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:05,990
is the same as the distinction between 
virtual reality and reality.

663
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:10,190
It's just like another human attempt to 
be in control of something.

664
00:33:10,191 --> 00:33:11,360
You want it,
you want to say,

665
00:33:11,361 --> 00:33:12,920
Oh,
I'll tell you if this is fucking reality

666
00:33:12,921 --> 00:33:13,754
or not.
Oh,

667
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:17,000
this is virtual reality.
This isn't reality reality.

668
00:33:17,001 --> 00:33:17,960
But it's like,
oh really?

669
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:21,770
So reality is compartmentalized into 
places where there's,

670
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:25,250
if something is created by a human,
oh no,

671
00:33:25,251 --> 00:33:26,660
that's not real reality.

672
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:29,660
Even though humans are reality.
Reality is reality.

673
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:30,853
Intelligence is intelligence because the
intelligence is inhabiting something 

674
00:33:35,031 --> 00:33:35,864
that isn't the human vessel.
It goes back to what we were talking 

675
00:33:37,941 --> 00:33:39,110
about earlier,
what,

676
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:43,490
cause it's not in a fucking meat body 
now it's artificial intelligence.

677
00:33:43,491 --> 00:33:47,030
How is why intelligence is intelligence?
Yeah,

678
00:33:47,031 --> 00:33:47,864
and again I think it goes back to what 
we were talking about earlier that we 

679
00:33:50,601 --> 00:33:52,880
try to define intelligence by our own 
measures,

680
00:33:52,881 --> 00:33:54,440
like the ability to write something 
down,

681
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,750
the ability to move.
How about that?

682
00:33:56,751 --> 00:33:57,584
We,
we have that inexorably connected to 

683
00:33:59,031 --> 00:33:59,864
intelligence.
You have to be able to move to show me 

684
00:34:01,341 --> 00:34:03,040
your thinking and communicating.
Right?

685
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,033
Like despite what this woman was saying,
the scientist on this radiolab podcast 

686
00:34:07,641 --> 00:34:10,970
is that she goes,
I don't want to say that there.

687
00:34:10,971 --> 00:34:11,804
She's like,
it's hard to say that if they're 

688
00:34:12,591 --> 00:34:14,030
intelligent,
it's hard to,

689
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:18,980
but what's going on is their net work 
closely resembles a brain,

690
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:19,760
right?

691
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:23,840
The way it looks and also the way it's 
operating.

692
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:26,650
They,
it's as neuron like responses.

693
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:27,680
Yeah.
There's,

694
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:29,900
there's data being passed back and 
forth,

695
00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:31,820
right.
That we're just not,

696
00:34:31,821 --> 00:34:32,720
we,
not you,

697
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:33,613
not me.
For sure.

698
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:35,330
We don't,
we're not doing any research,

699
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:37,150
but these people,
we are somewhat,

700
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:37,993
I'm saying we as in humans,
they're just figuring this out really 

701
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:44,510
recently.
I think everything has a conscience or a

702
00:34:44,511 --> 00:34:46,550
consciousness.
I think every,

703
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:47,384
everything that you eat,
and I think that obviously plants for 

704
00:34:51,381 --> 00:34:54,950
the most part are like way less violent 
than animals.

705
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:58,430
You know,
like when you are taking in plants,

706
00:34:58,570 --> 00:34:59,403
it's just sent,
it seems to make sense that it would be 

707
00:35:02,901 --> 00:35:06,410
like a more peaceful existence.
Like the way you think about it.

708
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,630
Like you're,
you're just consuming plants.

709
00:35:08,631 --> 00:35:09,464
Like glue it,
all the animals that only consume 

710
00:35:10,461 --> 00:35:11,390
plants.
Right.

711
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:13,100
They're all like really peaceful.
Yes.

712
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:17,300
But then the animals that consume 
animals and plants,

713
00:35:17,301 --> 00:35:18,650
they've got to get dirty.
Yes.

714
00:35:18,651 --> 00:35:23,120
Those animals and the ones that only 
meet those are the scary ones.

715
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:24,320
Yeah,
you're right.

716
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,340
Yeah.
Yeah.

717
00:35:25,341 --> 00:35:27,830
Well it kind of makes sense.
I mean when a percent you need different

718
00:35:27,831 --> 00:35:32,831
tools for taking down a deer than you do
for eating a piece of Broccoli.

719
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,640
Well,
it's just,

720
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,980
I think people are trying to like move 
away from

721
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:42,630
the system that requires the violence 
and like a part of that.

722
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:43,493
The idea of that is to eat plants 
because like even if you're eating a 

723
00:35:46,651 --> 00:35:49,190
life form your,
you're,

724
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:50,093
you're,
you're less involved in violent 

725
00:35:52,831 --> 00:35:54,960
activity.
Like if you're eating meat,

726
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:56,640
you're involved in violent activity,
right?

727
00:35:56,641 --> 00:35:57,870
Some way,
even fish,

728
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,600
you're involved in some sort of violent 
activity.

729
00:36:00,601 --> 00:36:03,780
Those fish have to be,
they don't just instantaneously die.

730
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:05,970
They've got to be yanked into another 
dimension,

731
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,300
beat over the head with wooden clubs 
thrown into ice checks,

732
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:12,480
chasse with,
they'll flop and gasp for air until they

733
00:36:12,481 --> 00:36:13,314
finally go still.
I mean that's what happens when you eat 

734
00:36:14,911 --> 00:36:15,950
fish,
man.

735
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:18,770
You know,
it is one thing that is very,

736
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:20,543
they're all this indicates is how 
there's so much compassion inside of 

737
00:36:23,841 --> 00:36:24,674
human beings because whether you eat 
meat or whether you eat a vegetarian 

738
00:36:27,981 --> 00:36:30,710
diet,
if you're thinking about this,

739
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:31,603
it's really cool.
That's one of the cool things about us 

740
00:36:33,231 --> 00:36:35,180
is that we have this sense of like,
man,

741
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,433
yeah,
this does seem to be a violent thing 

742
00:36:38,691 --> 00:36:39,524
that I'm doing here.
I know this thing I'm eating has 

743
00:36:41,841 --> 00:36:42,674
suffered to some degree that I would 
never want anyone I know to suffer or 

744
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:52,460
myself as you know,
I th th so w there's compassion there,

745
00:36:52,461 --> 00:36:53,294
man.
And we want to live in a world where we 

746
00:36:55,431 --> 00:36:56,264
don't hurt things.
And if you do want to live in a world 

747
00:36:59,361 --> 00:37:00,194
where you hurt things,
well then you're probably in a lot of 

748
00:37:02,691 --> 00:37:03,800
pain yourself,
right?

749
00:37:03,801 --> 00:37:05,780
Yeah.
But so then,

750
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:06,643
but you get this is it man,
this is the fucking Bhagavad Gita 

751
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:15,160
because the Bhagavad Gita starts with a 
warrior are June looking out on this,

752
00:37:16,791 --> 00:37:17,624
uh,
this fucking massive army and sang to 

753
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,460
God the charioteer.

754
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:23,443
I see my friends here.
I see fathers and teachers and men that 

755
00:37:28,491 --> 00:37:30,260
I respect,
uh,

756
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:35,000
by killing them.
Don't I destroy my own soul?

757
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:35,953
Wouldn't it be better to go off into the
forest and live as it renunciate than 

758
00:37:39,681 --> 00:37:43,040
to,
to gain all the wealth in the world,

759
00:37:43,041 --> 00:37:46,790
but to have the blood of my teachers on 
my hands.

760
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:48,920
And this is the beginning of the bug of 
I get in,

761
00:37:48,921 --> 00:37:49,754
you would think because it's one of 
Gandhi's favorite books that the 

762
00:37:52,581 --> 00:37:54,170
response would be,
you're right,

763
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:56,900
let's not kill,
let's not fight.

764
00:37:56,901 --> 00:37:59,150
We're going to go in the woods.
But the response,

765
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:01,700
God says,
you speak words of wisdom,

766
00:38:01,701 --> 00:38:02,534
but you do not understand.
That's the beginning of the Bhagavad 

767
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:07,910
Gita.
That's where it starts is here's why you

768
00:38:07,911 --> 00:38:09,950
fight.
Here's why you have to kill.

769
00:38:09,951 --> 00:38:11,570
Sometimes.
Here's why.

770
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:16,600
There is action in the universe that 
will result in pain and suffering.

771
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,310
And this,
uh,

772
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:24,200
is to me the best like answer to all of 
this is a,

773
00:38:24,201 --> 00:38:29,000
when Krishna reveals his universal form 
is this cause called,

774
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:34,610
here comes this monstrous thing and 
arginine is describing what he's,

775
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:38,460
and this is the oppenheimer quote,
Oh,

776
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:42,220
home become death destroyer of worlds.
And Arjun is saying,

777
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:47,670
I see in your teeth the limbs of all 
humans being chewed and eaten,

778
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:54,250
your consuming everything,
your eating,

779
00:38:54,610 --> 00:38:57,100
everything is basically what he's 
saying.

780
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,113
And then he says,
can you please turn back into my 

781
00:38:59,861 --> 00:39:00,694
friends?
Cause it's so fucking intense to see 

782
00:39:03,101 --> 00:39:05,620
that.
And so that response is okay,

783
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:10,480
let's stop killing everything.
But look,

784
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:15,280
you're getting eaten by the universe.
No matter what you do,

785
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:19,990
you're being grounded dust by the force 
of time.

786
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:21,063
There is no escape from this.
You are in the digestive tract of a 

787
00:39:25,151 --> 00:39:25,984
being that is gradually transforming you
into nothingness depending on what you 

788
00:39:30,551 --> 00:39:32,890
want to believe,
unless you think there's some eternal,

789
00:39:32,891 --> 00:39:33,724
perpetual soul,
in which case the digestive system is 

790
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:39,630
freeing you from the uh,
uh,

791
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:42,640
the terrible and limited in closure of 
the human body.

792
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:43,870
Either way,
man,

793
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:47,920
we are being shifted and dramatic and 
beautiful way.

794
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:48,963
And as that's happening to think that 
you can somehow not realize what you 

795
00:39:53,981 --> 00:39:54,814
are,
which is you are one of the digestive 

796
00:39:56,951 --> 00:39:59,540
organs in the universe.
You are deaf.

797
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,480
No matter what you do,
man,

798
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:06,100
you are completely wiping beings out of 
the universe.

799
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:10,210
It every single fucking second.
If your immune system's working,

800
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:14,320
those sweeties of burrowed into your 
fucking skin and gotten into your mucous

801
00:40:14,321 --> 00:40:16,270
membranes,
you're wiping them out,

802
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:20,590
your blood cells are heartlessly fucking
killing them.

803
00:40:20,591 --> 00:40:24,040
And then maybe you had an ant on your 
counter when you drove your car.

804
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,113
I'd say there's a 60% to 90% chance.
You probably ran over some tiny little 

805
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:32,200
fucking bug that was walking across the 
street.

806
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:37,470
You can't live in this universe without 
killing things and um,

807
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:40,330
uh,
and you two are being killed.

808
00:40:40,331 --> 00:40:41,260
So you are like,
uh,

809
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,950
in the [inaudible] you're like,
uh,

810
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:46,390
a little bit of stomach acid helping to 
dissolve a steak.

811
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:51,510
You're a little bit of the digestive 
process of the universe killing and uh,

812
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,070
out putting energy from that 
destruction.

813
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:58,840
That's just what everything is really 
not to like justify a meat diet.

814
00:40:58,841 --> 00:41:01,360
If you could become a vegetarian,
do it,

815
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:04,000
be a vegetarian if it drawn,
if you're drawn to it,

816
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:05,043
it is a more peaceful thing.
We'll for sure factory farming is a 

817
00:41:08,981 --> 00:41:10,990
giant issue for anybody with a 
conscience.

818
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:15,220
Then when you get into other forms of 
acquiring meat,

819
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,240
then things get more complicated because
a,

820
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:19,840
if you're talking about hunting in 
particular,

821
00:41:19,841 --> 00:41:20,674
that's not easy for everybody to do.
And so it's almost impossible for 

822
00:41:22,841 --> 00:41:24,690
everybody to do.
Um,

823
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:25,563
so then you'd have to have ethical 
farming and then you'd have to decide 

824
00:41:28,061 --> 00:41:29,440
what is ethical,
how they,

825
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,750
what does ethical mean?
Free range chicken,

826
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,860
free range cows,
free range chickens.

827
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:35,181
Um,
you know,

828
00:41:35,181 --> 00:41:36,014
and you didn't have to decide that 
there's certain cycle of life involved 

829
00:41:38,421 --> 00:41:41,390
here and then you're willing to take 
part in it for your own health.

830
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:45,080
You're going to decide I'd like this,
my body functions better on this,

831
00:41:45,081 --> 00:41:47,510
so I'm going to,
I'm going to allow this to happen or,

832
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:48,860
or help it.
Participant,

833
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:50,300
yeah,
he'll participate in it.

834
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:51,883
But um,
I think when you see a bear eat a 

835
00:41:54,691 --> 00:41:55,524
salmon,
that bear is not thinking for a fucking 

836
00:41:58,431 --> 00:42:00,860
second about the feelings of that 
salmon.

837
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:04,610
It's just holding it down and tearing it
apart with no hesitation whatsoever.

838
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:07,520
When we reap,
let us from the ground.

839
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:11,420
Are we doing a more complicated version 
of that?

840
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:12,523
Are we pretending that this thing is 
this non feeling nonthinking thing 

841
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:18,950
because it doesn't move and it can't 
send emails.

842
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,910
But is it possible that all these things
that we call life,

843
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:25,910
all these things have a consciousness.
Everything does.

844
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,350
Squirrels,
people,

845
00:42:27,351 --> 00:42:30,200
monkeys,
fucking Alfalfa.

846
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:31,550
Oh yeah.
All that shit.

847
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:32,300
It's,
yeah,

848
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,081
it's a,
it's a,

849
00:42:33,081 --> 00:42:36,140
this is what I was thinking as I've been
doing vr,

850
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:40,880
having so many philosophical thoughts 
based on this incredible technology.

851
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:43,790
So this is what I started thinking is 
that human,

852
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:48,820
all living things are like organic 
virtual reality goggles,

853
00:42:50,391 --> 00:42:53,390
right?
So like a squirrel is a,

854
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:54,613
is like a kind of virtual reality goggle
that the universe is gazing through in 

855
00:42:59,421 --> 00:43:01,820
the form of a squirrel's reality,
right?

856
00:43:01,821 --> 00:43:04,670
So this consciousness,
this intelligence,

857
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:05,713
it's like an omnipresent force.
And every living thing is like a faucet 

858
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:16,400
that its life is this intelligence 
coming through and it's spreading itself

859
00:43:16,401 --> 00:43:17,234
based on the energetic system of the 
particular conduit that it's coming 

860
00:43:21,261 --> 00:43:24,830
through.
So a living squirrel is a portal that is

861
00:43:24,831 --> 00:43:29,330
opened up to the intelligence of the 
universe temporarily.

862
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:31,850
And when that intelligence flows through
the squirrel,

863
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:34,850
the way electricity runs through a 
motherboard,

864
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:36,650
uh,
then it's odd.

865
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:37,910
It's,
it's animated,

866
00:43:37,911 --> 00:43:40,580
right?
And so when the squirrel dies,

867
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:43,940
that it's not as though the intelligence
is gone.

868
00:43:43,941 --> 00:43:46,820
It's just that that particular conduit 
shots,

869
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:47,833
while there's a billion other conduits 
in any biom filled with that 

870
00:43:51,411 --> 00:43:53,030
intelligence,
pouring through it,

871
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:56,600
um,
and behaving according to the way,

872
00:43:56,601 --> 00:43:59,420
whatever the thing is that it's coming 
through in the same way that if you have

873
00:43:59,421 --> 00:44:03,890
a,
if you have a different ai programs with

874
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:07,880
different codes,
it's still processing the same energy.

875
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:08,893
It's just the energy is being 
transformed based on whatever the 

876
00:44:12,321 --> 00:44:14,180
specific system is,
you know.

877
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,193
So when we meet,
we're in a weird way eating the virtual 

878
00:44:18,561 --> 00:44:23,561
reality goggles that some thing was that
infinity was using to experience reality

879
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:30,050
and that reality that it infinity was 
experiencing through the vr goggles that

880
00:44:30,051 --> 00:44:34,800
you're eating inside your bond was not a
great fucking,

881
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:36,900
uh,
experience,

882
00:44:36,901 --> 00:44:39,390
you know,
so composed in those,

883
00:44:39,391 --> 00:44:42,300
in that Goggle,
in that life form that you're eating.

884
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:45,450
This is what the Hari Krishna say is all
the fear,

885
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:47,610
all the terror,
all the,

886
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:51,990
the momentum of that being's life 
somehow gets encoded into the,

887
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:56,130
uh,
atomic structure of the meat that you're

888
00:44:56,131 --> 00:44:56,964
consuming.
And so you take a little bit of that 

889
00:44:58,291 --> 00:45:03,291
suffering into you and that degrades 
your life in some slight way,

890
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:04,810
but totally me.

891
00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:05,643
Makes Sense.
Totally makes sense that there's 

892
00:45:09,101 --> 00:45:10,600
something that gets through it.
I mean,

893
00:45:10,601 --> 00:45:13,300
why would we assume that your diet 
isn't,

894
00:45:13,330 --> 00:45:16,030
I mean,
if you're eating biological particles,

895
00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:18,520
why would we assume that they have no 
influence on us?

896
00:45:19,390 --> 00:45:21,190
Like we would think that there,
we just know.

897
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:23,010
I just,
I broke it down to protein.

898
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:24,220
Yeah.
Water.

899
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:25,570
And that's it.
There's no,

900
00:45:25,571 --> 00:45:27,100
no chicken suffering in there at all.

901
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:28,260
No,
I ain't checking software.

902
00:45:28,261 --> 00:45:29,420
No Way.
Not a,

903
00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:30,980
not a trace of it,
but why not?

904
00:45:30,981 --> 00:45:31,814
All a dullness?
Just a dull chicken suffering that you 

905
00:45:34,431 --> 00:45:36,230
get in your mouth.
Yeah,

906
00:45:36,410 --> 00:45:39,020
just a kiss.
Delicious chicken.

907
00:45:39,021 --> 00:45:39,854
But there's an undertone of existential 
horror and my chicken waxy film on the 

908
00:45:45,021 --> 00:45:46,250
inside of your mouth.
Yeah,

909
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,500
just chicken sadness.
Yeah.

910
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:52,730
Oh Man.
I can remember like when,

911
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:54,500
when I was a kid,
we didn't fucking,

912
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:55,753
you know,
like you kind of knew the animals were 

913
00:45:57,021 --> 00:46:02,021
like the people just were a lot like I'm
reading fucking listen to the audio book

914
00:46:02,841 --> 00:46:04,910
rather of Moby Dick,
uh,

915
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:08,420
the Frank Mueller narration.
You ever read that book who's Frank?

916
00:46:08,421 --> 00:46:09,980
Mueller?
Frank Mueller,

917
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,510
uh,
is the guy,

918
00:46:11,511 --> 00:46:16,130
is the Vo actor who narrated the dark 
tower series by Stephen King.

919
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:17,023
And he is the best.
And so I guess there's no way I'm 

920
00:46:19,761 --> 00:46:23,180
fucking reading moby Dick,
but listening to someone who understands

921
00:46:23,181 --> 00:46:26,900
what he's reading helps you understand 
it and uh,

922
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,500
cause he puts the inflection in the 
right place,

923
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:30,383
the inflections are in the right place,
and he's clearly some kind of super 

924
00:46:32,631 --> 00:46:35,150
genius who just gets moby Dick.

925
00:46:35,150 --> 00:46:35,983
And he understands every single fucking 
passage that Melville endlessly writes 

926
00:46:40,761 --> 00:46:44,420
about the varied,
the deepest details of whales,

927
00:46:44,421 --> 00:46:45,254
man Melville fucking love whales.
And the book is like a sort of portal 

928
00:46:50,151 --> 00:46:50,984
into,
before they knew that whales are 

929
00:46:52,011 --> 00:46:52,970
mammals,
right?

930
00:46:52,971 --> 00:46:54,150
So,
you know,

931
00:46:54,151 --> 00:46:56,540
we thought they were fucking fish 
Leviathan,

932
00:46:56,541 --> 00:46:57,374
right?
Isn't that funny that we make that 

933
00:46:58,431 --> 00:46:59,840
distinction?
Let's talk about that.

934
00:47:00,290 --> 00:47:01,850
I like sat there fish,
fuck them.

935
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:03,340
Well,
they're mammals.

936
00:47:03,341 --> 00:47:04,250
They're ass,
right?

937
00:47:04,251 --> 00:47:04,611
Right,
right.

938
00:47:04,611 --> 00:47:06,470
We can't do that.
We got,

939
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:08,590
we got weird teams.
Other teams weren't.

940
00:47:08,591 --> 00:47:09,800
Okay.
So I'll answer to that.

941
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:12,740
If to use the virtual reality goggle 
example,

942
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:13,753
let's imagine there's like 15 different 
virtual reality goggles on the table 

943
00:47:18,950 --> 00:47:23,950
that represent a kind of spectrum of um,
technological advancement.

944
00:47:25,490 --> 00:47:28,340
So here we've got a,
I don't know,

945
00:47:28,350 --> 00:47:30,100
remember the old,
you used to have those like,

946
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:33,040
uh,
those stupid view finders you could flip

947
00:47:33,041 --> 00:47:33,850
through and look at it.

948
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:36,580
Okay.
So on one side we have a view finder and

949
00:47:36,581 --> 00:47:40,990
on the other side we've got some shit 
that doesn't even exist yet.

950
00:47:40,991 --> 00:47:45,991
Some neural interface,
you put it on a harmonic magnetic field,

951
00:47:46,571 --> 00:47:50,290
interacts with your brain and you not 
only go into a location,

952
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:52,570
but you experienced the memories,
emotions,

953
00:47:52,810 --> 00:47:53,643
thoughts,
and dreams of the Avatar within the 

954
00:47:55,871 --> 00:47:56,704
game.
You literally become the figure that's 

955
00:47:58,001 --> 00:47:59,470
on the other side of the spectrum,
right?

956
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:04,030
So here we have this sort of like 
spectrum of potential experience.

957
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:07,600
I think it would be safe to say that,
uh,

958
00:48:07,601 --> 00:48:11,230
the experience of a Broccoli,
right?

959
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:16,060
Just based on the TAC in there versus 
the experience of like a,

960
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:21,390
I don't know,
a fucking mit student genius who's like,

961
00:48:22,010 --> 00:48:22,843
come healthy.
I'd say that you could say that there's 

962
00:48:25,061 --> 00:48:30,061
a varying levels of experience as to 
what is being experienced.

963
00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:32,620
Who's to say,
now that I say it,

964
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:35,260
I think I'm totally wrong.
I'm sorry for the rant.

965
00:48:35,390 --> 00:48:36,223
Okay.

966
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:42,390
As a,
at the very end of it,

967
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:44,280
there was some part of me,
he's like,

968
00:48:44,281 --> 00:48:45,210
just shut up,
man.

969
00:48:45,211 --> 00:48:46,390
That's wrong.
That's not it.

970
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,230
So forgive me you guys.
I try with that one.

971
00:48:50,590 --> 00:48:51,380
You just,
it,

972
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:53,160
it flopped.
In my own brain.

973
00:48:53,190 --> 00:48:55,950
They don't all land.
They don't own the land.

974
00:48:56,010 --> 00:48:57,170
If they did,
it wouldn't be fun.

975
00:48:57,230 --> 00:49:00,570
It wouldn't be fine.
But I will admit when they don't land in

976
00:49:00,571 --> 00:49:01,141
that,
definitely.

977
00:49:01,141 --> 00:49:02,190
I think you're right,
man.

978
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:05,130
Why do we make the distinction?
It's like God damn weird distinction.

979
00:49:05,131 --> 00:49:06,600
I mean,
it's an intelligence distinction.

980
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:07,443
Yeah.
We just decided to fish a stupid as 

981
00:49:08,311 --> 00:49:09,720
fuck.
But you know what?

982
00:49:09,721 --> 00:49:10,610
They're not.
Here's the,

983
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:13,470
here's where they're not.
Here's one thing we eat all the time.

984
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:16,620
That is probably a smart as a monkey.
And that's an octopus.

985
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:17,701
Oh,
I know.

986
00:49:17,701 --> 00:49:19,500
Yeah.
We talked to us all the time.

987
00:49:19,530 --> 00:49:20,363
They are crazy smart.
Have you ever seen the new video that 

988
00:49:23,041 --> 00:49:23,874
they put out of an octopus going through
a key or a whole rather than just the 

989
00:49:26,881 --> 00:49:28,500
size of a quarter?
Yeah,

990
00:49:28,501 --> 00:49:29,370
man.
Yeah,

991
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:31,470
I did see that.
It's crazy.

992
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:34,920
It's amazing what they can do to their 
bodies.

993
00:49:34,921 --> 00:49:36,150
This is insane.
And yeah,

994
00:49:36,151 --> 00:49:37,440
Mckenna loved them.
Right?

995
00:49:37,770 --> 00:49:42,510
He was like in love with Octopi.
Is that the plural Octopi?

996
00:49:42,570 --> 00:49:43,403
That's a good question.
He was in love with it is he thought 

997
00:49:45,511 --> 00:49:50,110
that they were like the ability to have 
multiple appendages and,

998
00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:50,963
and,
and the crazy camouflage abilities they 

999
00:49:53,341 --> 00:49:56,430
have would combine to really,
um,

1000
00:49:57,270 --> 00:50:00,480
open up new levels of communication that
humans don't have.

1001
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:01,573
Cause it seems like he was a,
he was a little frustrated by the 

1002
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:05,993
limitation of the human vocabulary and 
the way we emote things to articulate 

1003
00:50:10,801 --> 00:50:11,634
the universe.
So it'd be nice to have a bunch of 

1004
00:50:13,231 --> 00:50:14,064
different limbs that had no bones that 
you can turn any which way while 

1005
00:50:18,061 --> 00:50:22,430
shifting colors that beats fucking 
emoticons by shot man.

1006
00:50:23,970 --> 00:50:27,910
I mean they can change color.
They shoot ink into the air and he,

1007
00:50:27,911 --> 00:50:28,160
he

1008
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,440
was one that I first heard speculate 
that the ink,

1009
00:50:30,441 --> 00:50:33,530
when they shoot ink into the air,
that it might be like a racer fluid.

1010
00:50:33,650 --> 00:50:37,370
Like look how small that hole is and 
look at this big ass octopus.

1011
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:38,503
Get through this tiny hall.
I mean you would look at that hole and 

1012
00:50:40,911 --> 00:50:43,010
you would have like,
there's no way,

1013
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:45,260
but these things,
not only can they get out of a hole like

1014
00:50:45,261 --> 00:50:46,094
that,
but they can walk on land for long 

1015
00:50:47,571 --> 00:50:50,330
periods of time,
climb back up into their fish tanks,

1016
00:50:50,990 --> 00:50:53,000
lift the lid,
get inside.

1017
00:50:54,070 --> 00:50:56,600
I mean they're aliens man.
That's,

1018
00:50:56,601 --> 00:50:58,760
I mean that might as well be on another 
planet.

1019
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:00,770
We're just used to it because it's on 
earth.

1020
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:04,790
The thing is a giant bulbous head,
long moveable arms.

1021
00:51:04,791 --> 00:51:08,270
He knows how to unscrew jars and he's 
got like a kind of like cool,

1022
00:51:08,271 --> 00:51:10,910
relaxed look on his face.
Like he's,

1023
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:14,450
he's definitely relaxed.
They're emotionless.

1024
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:17,990
They're very strange.
It's a very strange being.

1025
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:21,980
It's very different than a fish and uh,
but it lives with fish,

1026
00:51:21,981 --> 00:51:24,770
so fuck it.
I mean,

1027
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:26,490
they're probably a smart as whales,

1028
00:51:26,710 --> 00:51:31,580
everything is alive.
That's the ultimate thing though.

1029
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:32,733
That's the final place you got to get to
is that you are a part of a super 

1030
00:51:38,051 --> 00:51:43,051
organism that is stretching through time
in the form of every generation of thing

1031
00:51:44,981 --> 00:51:46,130
that ever lived.
Right.

1032
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:47,013
And it's currently like,
it's like this being that has an 

1033
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:51,933
infinite number of appendages that 
represent all living forms of life on 

1034
00:51:56,171 --> 00:51:59,800
earth.
And just like the same way that like you

1035
00:51:59,801 --> 00:52:03,940
investigate a thing.
All these impinj appendages have wrapped

1036
00:52:03,941 --> 00:52:06,520
around the planet and they're probing,
probing,

1037
00:52:06,521 --> 00:52:07,420
probing,
probing,

1038
00:52:07,421 --> 00:52:08,254
probing the planet.
So it's like every living thing is the 

1039
00:52:10,811 --> 00:52:15,430
very end of an interdimensional 
superintelligent appendage.

1040
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:16,930
You know,
this is kind of like the,

1041
00:52:16,931 --> 00:52:18,300
uh,
uh,

1042
00:52:18,310 --> 00:52:19,143
hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy where 
he said that mice are just the ends of 

1043
00:52:24,370 --> 00:52:25,203
the tentacles of his inner dimensional 
creatures studying scientists that 

1044
00:52:28,391 --> 00:52:33,391
laboratory mice,
he was a fucking genius.

1045
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:34,773
But,
um,

1046
00:52:35,050 --> 00:52:35,883
in the same way,
when you look at like every single 

1047
00:52:38,141 --> 00:52:42,100
living being on earth is actually 
protruding from,

1048
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:43,390
uh,
you know,

1049
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:44,224
generation after generation of being 
that stretches back to the beginning of 

1050
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:51,850
organic life on planet earth.
So it's like earth suddenly gets wife.

1051
00:52:51,851 --> 00:52:55,240
How,
who the fuck knows my theory aliens?

1052
00:52:55,241 --> 00:52:57,730
But who knows?
Maybe it just randomly happen.

1053
00:52:57,910 --> 00:53:00,700
Who knows?
But so suddenly springing from the earth

1054
00:53:00,701 --> 00:53:01,534
or these very rudimentary organisms that
over the course of millennia gradually 

1055
00:53:07,091 --> 00:53:11,800
stretched out and changed to become 
various types of devices,

1056
00:53:11,950 --> 00:53:14,740
to study the crevices,
crannies,

1057
00:53:14,910 --> 00:53:15,743
and,
and an air of this planet until 

1058
00:53:17,261 --> 00:53:20,680
eventually it became monkeys and the 
monkeys became people.

1059
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:21,693
And now we're like a very advanced scope
that is peering into the atomic and 

1060
00:53:26,281 --> 00:53:31,281
subatomic level of the fucking thing.
But when you look at a squirrel's life,

1061
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,210
eagles life,
uh,

1062
00:53:33,211 --> 00:53:34,320
fucking,
uh,

1063
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:35,373
salmon being eaten by a bear's life,
it's interesting to consider that what 

1064
00:53:38,551 --> 00:53:39,384
you're seeing is an infinite number of 
scopes through which something that 

1065
00:53:43,951 --> 00:53:44,784
appears to be either investigating this 
dimension or just enjoying being in it 

1066
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:51,840
is coming through.
You know,

1067
00:53:51,841 --> 00:53:56,640
that seems to be what's happening.
That is an idea that gets echoed in,

1068
00:53:56,641 --> 00:53:57,474
um,

1069
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:01,160
uh,
and like some eastern philosophies and,

1070
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:02,321
uh,
some,

1071
00:54:02,321 --> 00:54:03,020
uh,
it's,

1072
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:05,460
it's an interesting take on it for sure.
What would,

1073
00:54:05,461 --> 00:54:08,300
what's definitely happening is there is 
some consumption going on.

1074
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,580
Everything's consuming something.
Yeah.

1075
00:54:10,610 --> 00:54:11,443
That's what this is the,
one of the things about this radio lab 

1076
00:54:12,561 --> 00:54:13,394
podcast,
it was so fascinating where was talking 

1077
00:54:14,511 --> 00:54:19,511
about these fun guide devouring 
microscopic insects and um,

1078
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:23,900
also like literally tapping into rocks 
for minerals.

1079
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:26,240
It's really,
really intense stuff.

1080
00:54:26,241 --> 00:54:27,074
And having this intense relationship 
with these plants where they're feeding 

1081
00:54:31,491 --> 00:54:35,030
off the root system and the root systems
are feeding them and they're feeding the

1082
00:54:35,031 --> 00:54:37,670
root systems.
They're exchanging sugar and uh,

1083
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,080
and minerals.
Yeah.

1084
00:54:39,081 --> 00:54:40,430
It's really crazy,
dude.

1085
00:54:40,930 --> 00:54:42,080
I mean,
it's really,

1086
00:54:42,081 --> 00:54:42,914
really bizarre.
They were talking about miles and miles 

1087
00:54:44,901 --> 00:54:45,734
of these microscopic fung fungi in the 
soil in a tiny piece of soil and miles 

1088
00:54:50,721 --> 00:54:51,470
and miles.

1089
00:54:51,470 --> 00:54:52,110
Yeah,
yeah,

1090
00:54:52,110 --> 00:54:52,561
yeah,
yeah.

1091
00:54:52,561 --> 00:54:53,750
The mycelium,
right?

1092
00:54:54,030 --> 00:54:55,080
Yeah.
So like,

1093
00:54:55,350 --> 00:54:56,280
so when you,
okay,

1094
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:57,173
so everything's eating itself,
but if you imagine that what you're 

1095
00:55:01,261 --> 00:55:04,950
looking at is actually only one half of 
the thing,

1096
00:55:04,951 --> 00:55:09,090
because we can't see into the 
nothingness that happens after death,

1097
00:55:09,330 --> 00:55:12,030
then it could be that you're actually 
looking at one,

1098
00:55:12,270 --> 00:55:14,910
just one part of a process,
right?

1099
00:55:14,911 --> 00:55:15,744
You're seeing just what you're,
you're seeing a limited part of an 

1100
00:55:19,021 --> 00:55:23,700
infinite process that's happening where 
death is just one piece of it.

1101
00:55:23,850 --> 00:55:27,240
But the thing that dies doesn't,
um,

1102
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:29,100
isn't annihilated it.

1103
00:55:31,110 --> 00:55:31,710
Okay.

1104
00:55:31,710 --> 00:55:32,220
No,
go ahead.

1105
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:33,240
It's not,
it doesn't go.

1106
00:55:33,390 --> 00:55:34,740
So the idea is it's like,
okay,

1107
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:39,120
what you are is a thing growing out of 
time.

1108
00:55:39,150 --> 00:55:41,640
Right?
You're growing from that,

1109
00:55:41,641 --> 00:55:46,530
which is not into that which is,
or that which is not known to that.

1110
00:55:46,531 --> 00:55:49,560
Which is is nice because where are you?
Where were you before you died?

1111
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:51,370
Who knows?
I know you,

1112
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:52,890
you're born before you were born.
Oh,

1113
00:55:52,930 --> 00:55:54,390
right.
Same thing.

1114
00:55:54,391 --> 00:55:56,670
According to some religions,
but uh,

1115
00:55:56,850 --> 00:55:59,190
so when you look at that as part of a 
continuum,

1116
00:55:59,191 --> 00:56:00,024
right?
Instead of just like you are born and 

1117
00:56:02,491 --> 00:56:03,324
then you die and then nothingness,
if you look at it as part of energetic 

1118
00:56:06,121 --> 00:56:10,830
continuum of which we can only witness 
this particular part of the continuum,

1119
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:15,480
we don't have the technology yet to peer
into the other part of the continuum.

1120
00:56:15,630 --> 00:56:16,463
So if you look at it as an actual cycle,
then the brutality of the universe 

1121
00:56:20,970 --> 00:56:24,430
becomes a little less significant 
because you realize like,

1122
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:25,293
oh no,
it's just like things diving out of the 

1123
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:31,910
nothingness into somethingness are 
returning to the nothingness.

1124
00:56:31,910 --> 00:56:35,980
Then the same way a dolphin jumps up and
goes back down into the sea.

1125
00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:38,740
That's what we're doing.
Only when we dive into time,

1126
00:56:38,890 --> 00:56:41,710
we take on a form.
When we dive out of time,

1127
00:56:41,890 --> 00:56:45,460
we become the formless and then we come 
back out of time again.

1128
00:56:45,730 --> 00:56:48,550
That's reincarnation.
It's reincarnation is,

1129
00:56:48,790 --> 00:56:50,560
I'm sorry if I've said on this podcast 
before,

1130
00:56:50,561 --> 00:56:55,480
but reincarnation is like a fucking 
dolphin trick only in this case,

1131
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:56,613
the trick that you're doing is called 
your incarnation and the particular way 

1132
00:57:00,461 --> 00:57:03,790
that you live,
whether it's as it is for most people,

1133
00:57:03,791 --> 00:57:04,624
a kind of failure cause how the fuck are
you going to figure out what to do when 

1134
00:57:07,331 --> 00:57:11,680
you dive into time for such a temporary 
fleeting lifetime,

1135
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:14,200
like to suddenly to be able to do back 
flips and shit.

1136
00:57:14,410 --> 00:57:16,450
It's maybe you're not gonna be able to 
do that right away,

1137
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:19,540
but you dive out of time or out of 
nothingness,

1138
00:57:19,541 --> 00:57:21,850
come into somethingness incarnate,
incarnate,

1139
00:57:21,851 --> 00:57:22,684
incarnate.
Here we are as a being have a life and 

1140
00:57:24,881 --> 00:57:26,710
then you go back into the nothingness 
again.

1141
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:27,813
And so the people that we are most 
amazed by in history or just people who 

1142
00:57:32,141 --> 00:57:32,974
did really awesome tricks where they're 
temporary human current incarnation is 

1143
00:57:36,761 --> 00:57:38,320
they came jumping out of the 
nothingness.

1144
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:40,090
That's what we're in right now,
man.

1145
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:41,133
Just a temporary transitory state of 
harmonized Adams that have become aware 

1146
00:57:46,931 --> 00:57:47,764
of themselves,
that are about to go through of 

1147
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:51,153
incredible energetic shift where you 
become nothing and then maybe become 

1148
00:57:58,661 --> 00:58:00,510
something again for infinity.

1149
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:01,953
We have a real hard time having the 
perspective of your body turning into 

1150
00:58:06,431 --> 00:58:07,264
bacteria or you couldn't back to,
you're consuming your body when you die 

1151
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:10,753
of that not being a bad thing,
that it's a part of life and that you 

1152
00:58:14,471 --> 00:58:19,150
will be conscious inside that bacteria 
and then maybe your consciousness leaves

1153
00:58:19,151 --> 00:58:19,984
this and travels with you with your 
cells and your DNA as you're being 

1154
00:58:24,401 --> 00:58:25,580
consumed.
Yeah.

1155
00:58:25,810 --> 00:58:26,643
And then it becomes a part of some 
gigantic matrix and that's what maybe 

1156
00:58:28,871 --> 00:58:31,360
that's what you're tapping into when 
you're doing things like dmt.

1157
00:58:31,450 --> 00:58:34,420
Yeah.
When you hit that well of consciousness,

1158
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:37,510
whatever the fuck that is that you hit 
when you,

1159
00:58:37,511 --> 00:58:40,110
you run into that sea of reality.
Yeah.

1160
00:58:40,210 --> 00:58:45,210
When I say reality like this,
but just intense God,

1161
00:58:45,321 --> 00:58:48,130
like no bullshit.
Like there's,

1162
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:50,320
it knows everything.
There's no bullshit.

1163
00:58:50,350 --> 00:58:51,590
It's like you and you,
you,

1164
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:54,040
you have to abandon all your worldly 
thoughts.

1165
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:57,010
Yeah.
Abandon all your ideas of life and death

1166
00:58:57,011 --> 00:59:00,970
and ego and just give in and be one with
the whole thing.

1167
00:59:01,270 --> 00:59:04,390
And maybe that's what we do all the time
when we're sleeping,

1168
00:59:04,391 --> 00:59:05,224
man.
I mean it's entirely possible that what 

1169
00:59:06,731 --> 00:59:07,564
we don't remember is existing in that 
realm and that that realm is something 

1170
00:59:10,781 --> 00:59:11,614
that were just shut off from because for
us to get done what we have to get done 

1171
00:59:14,591 --> 00:59:15,424
with this monkey body,
you can't be fucking contemplating that 

1172
00:59:17,021 --> 00:59:18,730
all the time cause you're not going to 
get shit done.

1173
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:19,401
You're getting,
you get,

1174
00:59:19,401 --> 00:59:22,250
you're going to be your,
you're going to be philosophical,

1175
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:23,263
you're going to be too confused.
You're going to be so blown away by the 

1176
00:59:26,571 --> 00:59:29,750
images of that other world.
You can't handle it.

1177
00:59:29,751 --> 00:59:30,584
So you just,
the reality of life just completely 

1178
00:59:33,951 --> 00:59:34,784
takes over.

1179
00:59:34,810 --> 00:59:36,010
Dude,
you didn't,

1180
00:59:36,670 --> 00:59:39,040
I mean I don't,
I don't think you meant to do it,

1181
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:40,233
but you are take,
you waited when you said that the 

1182
00:59:42,401 --> 00:59:46,210
essence of so many different religious 
systems,

1183
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:47,073
which is that here is this Omni present,
infinite ever replenishing creative 

1184
00:59:53,470 --> 00:59:58,470
matrix of intelligence that is so much 
bigger than I am.

1185
00:59:59,070 --> 01:00:03,310
It's incomprehensible and an end,
like you said,

1186
01:00:03,311 --> 01:00:05,530
you have to let go of all your worldly 
ideas,

1187
01:00:05,531 --> 01:00:07,060
your thoughts,
your ego.

1188
01:00:07,390 --> 01:00:11,290
You have to let your ego die because 
what the fuck are you going to do in the

1189
01:00:11,291 --> 01:00:12,124
face of that thing?
Are you going to hold on to the stuff 

1190
01:00:15,131 --> 01:00:17,290
you're proud of?
Are you going to hold onto the,

1191
01:00:17,620 --> 01:00:20,410
the victories that you've achieved in 
your mind,

1192
01:00:20,411 --> 01:00:21,244
newt flickering human incarnation?
When you're in the presence of the 

1193
01:00:24,671 --> 01:00:28,780
source of victory in the universe,
what are you going to do there?

1194
01:00:28,990 --> 01:00:33,130
What's the correct reaction to have if a
thing like that?

1195
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:34,173
We're real.
And so depending on what religious 

1196
01:00:36,791 --> 01:00:37,624
system you subscribe to those,
all of those are answers to that 

1197
01:00:40,931 --> 01:00:42,220
question.
You know,

1198
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:45,670
and you hear the answer coming up,
uh,

1199
01:00:45,671 --> 01:00:48,610
in a similar way usually,
which is you serve it.

1200
01:00:48,970 --> 01:00:51,130
You try to become a servant to it 
because,

1201
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:53,350
because what else are you going to 
fucking do?

1202
01:00:53,590 --> 01:00:56,500
Are you gonna you gonna are you gonna 
teach it?

1203
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:58,480
Are you going to show it how to do 
something?

1204
01:00:58,570 --> 01:01:02,390
Are you going,
what are you going to show?

1205
01:01:02,970 --> 01:01:04,120
Hey guys,
relax.

1206
01:01:04,121 --> 01:01:05,770
I'm here.
Uh,

1207
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:07,840
I know you've been waiting for a long 
time.

1208
01:01:07,870 --> 01:01:09,700
Infinity.
Finally,

1209
01:01:09,701 --> 01:01:10,534
I'm amongst you with my wisdom,
my 47 years on planet earth as a tire 

1210
01:01:16,481 --> 01:01:21,481
salesman who finally does dmt for the 
first time.

1211
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:23,320
Everybody sit down.
Oh,

1212
01:01:23,330 --> 01:01:24,460
got it.
You come back.

1213
01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:25,810
Yeah.
Yeah.

1214
01:01:25,870 --> 01:01:28,750
Let's start with roses.
I liked the color of them,

1215
01:01:28,751 --> 01:01:31,420
but maybe we make it a brighter red.
What do you think?

1216
01:01:31,810 --> 01:01:33,940
How about make it so dear?
Don't want to eat them.

1217
01:01:34,450 --> 01:01:36,400
My mom,
she has a fucking garden.

1218
01:01:36,850 --> 01:01:39,580
She's always mad.
The deer is eating them roses.

1219
01:01:40,390 --> 01:01:41,530
Yeah.
This is,

1220
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:43,260
this is the,
um,

1221
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:44,913
so this is,

1222
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:46,990
yeah,
this is why I really love this.

1223
01:01:47,260 --> 01:01:48,093
Bhakti Yoga,
which is a cause it like takes that 

1224
01:01:50,381 --> 01:01:51,214
idea.
There is a super intelligent creative 

1225
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:56,133
force in the universe.
And the word for it is Bhagavan and it 

1226
01:01:59,231 --> 01:02:03,130
basically means maximum everything.
So ultimate beauty,

1227
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:06,430
ultimate intelligence,
ultimate attractiveness.

1228
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:11,140
Ultimate,
ultimate love.

1229
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:12,910
It's the ultimate of ultimate's.
Right?

1230
01:02:12,911 --> 01:02:16,240
So this thing has,
um,

1231
01:02:16,870 --> 01:02:18,090
inadvertently,
I,

1232
01:02:18,100 --> 01:02:21,360
it depends on what version of it.
Probably not inadvertently,

1233
01:02:21,361 --> 01:02:23,250
but this thing has a kr,
this,

1234
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:25,133
it's so potent that the way it's 
interacting with time is that it's 

1235
01:02:29,340 --> 01:02:30,173
breaking into an infinite number of 
pieces that have all become semi or 

1236
01:02:35,041 --> 01:02:35,874
super aware.
So it's consciousness is dispersed 

1237
01:02:38,761 --> 01:02:43,260
itself through its creation and every 
single minute element,

1238
01:02:43,261 --> 01:02:44,094
like some fractal,
every single little piece of it is a 

1239
01:02:47,281 --> 01:02:50,220
possessor of this infinite 
consciousness.

1240
01:02:50,221 --> 01:02:55,221
And so that infinite consciousness is 
the source of love.

1241
01:02:55,470 --> 01:02:58,800
And um,
it's basically,

1242
01:02:58,860 --> 01:02:59,693
uh,
let's you fall in love with it if you 

1243
01:03:01,351 --> 01:03:04,440
want to and it loves you too,
which is the,

1244
01:03:04,441 --> 01:03:06,000
what's really trippy to imagine.

1245
01:03:06,020 --> 01:03:07,830
This is a thought experiment,
man.

1246
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:12,570
Imagine that thing you just described,
that infinite fucking thing,

1247
01:03:12,571 --> 01:03:17,571
the no bullshit thing that demands that 
you drop your history like a fucking old

1248
01:03:18,061 --> 01:03:18,894
nasty bag of shit.
Imagine if that thing also was aware of 

1249
01:03:24,421 --> 01:03:29,421
you completely and also loved you.
Imagine that shit man.

1250
01:03:30,990 --> 01:03:35,990
That's the craziest idea ever.
That's a crazy fucking idea.

1251
01:03:36,420 --> 01:03:37,253
That's better than you know,
like when you like kind of like a girl 

1252
01:03:39,780 --> 01:03:40,613
and you start thinking like maybe you 
don't do this because you're a fucking 

1253
01:03:43,381 --> 01:03:46,470
muscular super billionaires.
It's the host the UFC.

1254
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:48,520
But somebody like me,
when I,

1255
01:03:48,810 --> 01:03:51,540
if a girl starts liking you,
you start thinking like,

1256
01:03:51,630 --> 01:03:56,630
holy shit does this girl,
I think this girl likes me.

1257
01:03:57,030 --> 01:04:00,150
I think this beautiful,
incredibly beautiful girl likes me.

1258
01:04:00,210 --> 01:04:02,880
Could this be,
that's the beginning of all love songs,

1259
01:04:02,881 --> 01:04:04,320
right?
That's the beginning of,

1260
01:04:04,321 --> 01:04:07,410
of like all human happiness is holy 
shit.

1261
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:11,400
The girl I like likes me back.
I think she likes me.

1262
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:13,860
Holy Shit.
I think she's falling in love with me.

1263
01:04:13,861 --> 01:04:14,694
This incredibly beautiful girl.
So Bhakti Yoga is that exact concept 

1264
01:04:18,810 --> 01:04:22,320
transferred to the universe.
So now you're like,

1265
01:04:22,530 --> 01:04:25,140
wait a minute.
This entire,

1266
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:26,153
the source of all things in the universe
has a personality and it seems to love 

1267
01:04:32,371 --> 01:04:35,220
me.
Not No fucking tame way.

1268
01:04:35,430 --> 01:04:36,263
Not In like the way that you might hear,
like Jesus loves you and then you 

1269
01:04:40,231 --> 01:04:41,064
imagine it being like,
that means you could go over to his 

1270
01:04:42,631 --> 01:04:45,780
house and sit down and have like a 
boring cup of tea and leave,

1271
01:04:45,970 --> 01:04:47,100
you know,
like that,

1272
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:48,390
that,
that kind of love.

1273
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:51,060
No,
this is a fucking wild,

1274
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:54,570
savage,
unpredictable.

1275
01:04:54,810 --> 01:04:55,643
Love the way your best friend loves you 
or the way that like a comedian loves 

1276
01:05:00,031 --> 01:05:00,661
you,
which is like,

1277
01:05:00,661 --> 01:05:02,250
you don't know what the fuck's going to 
happen.

1278
01:05:02,430 --> 01:05:05,160
It's not the way the comedian loves you.
Yeah.

1279
01:05:05,161 --> 01:05:05,994
You know,
like comedians are going to do weird 

1280
01:05:06,871 --> 01:05:08,430
shit.
If you're friends with Comedians,

1281
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:12,600
you're going to get a lot of like weird 
fucking pictures sent to you.

1282
01:05:12,601 --> 01:05:14,700
You know,
on a regular basis.

1283
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:15,713
You're going to get people calling you 
and playing tricks on you from time to 

1284
01:05:18,311 --> 01:05:21,100
time for no other reason than just to do
it.

1285
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:22,750
Right.
But they love you.

1286
01:05:22,870 --> 01:05:24,880
They fucking love you.
That's what's behind it.

1287
01:05:24,970 --> 01:05:27,910
So in the same way,
this is the concept,

1288
01:05:28,030 --> 01:05:31,720
it's not a team kind of love.
It'll kill you,

1289
01:05:31,930 --> 01:05:34,990
like it'll eat you,
but it's still loves you.

1290
01:05:35,170 --> 01:05:36,003
And it'll eat you because it knows that 
you're just a fucking pair of virtual 

1291
01:05:38,201 --> 01:05:41,530
reality goggles.
You're just a temporary flickering thing

1292
01:05:41,710 --> 01:05:43,450
that's going to keep going on forever.

1293
01:05:43,950 --> 01:05:44,783
This ego in the survival mechanism is 
what makes us think that it's more 

1294
01:05:50,151 --> 01:05:53,240
important to root for our team.
Like we have teams,

1295
01:05:53,241 --> 01:05:55,400
right?
So first of all were teen prime mate.

1296
01:05:55,430 --> 01:05:56,640
Don't eat any primates.
Yep.

1297
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:58,910
Once you get past team primary were teen
mammal.

1298
01:05:59,210 --> 01:06:00,043
So if you have a choice between killing 
a gigantic fish or killing a gigantic 

1299
01:06:02,871 --> 01:06:06,860
mammal that you thought was a fish,
you got to kill the fish so you can kill

1300
01:06:06,861 --> 01:06:09,620
fucking blue Marlin's all day long.
Bring those bitches in,

1301
01:06:09,621 --> 01:06:13,520
chop up and the stakes.
But don't make oil for lamps.

1302
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:15,700
I love Moby Dick.
That's fucked up.

1303
01:06:15,701 --> 01:06:18,230
Fucking oil out of the suite,
the bad guy.

1304
01:06:18,260 --> 01:06:19,700
You're the bad guy.
And I agree.

1305
01:06:20,420 --> 01:06:21,630
You know,
for whatever reason,

1306
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:23,630
especially with uh,
with whales,

1307
01:06:24,030 --> 01:06:24,863
I have a thing for whales,
have a thing for whales and orcas and 

1308
01:06:28,071 --> 01:06:30,020
dolphins.
I'm fascinated by them,

1309
01:06:30,021 --> 01:06:32,720
like legitimately perplexed.

1310
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:35,720
I think that it's entirely possible,
but both by,

1311
01:06:35,721 --> 01:06:39,830
both with both dolphins and orchids,
that they're just as smart as us.

1312
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:42,110
They just don't express it the same way.
They have a,

1313
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:44,330
they have a different,
different kinds of existence.

1314
01:06:44,510 --> 01:06:45,343
They don't need,
they don't want to dominate other than 

1315
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:50,210
controlling food.
They just want to have food.

1316
01:06:50,510 --> 01:06:51,610
And once they have food,
I,

1317
01:06:51,620 --> 01:06:52,640
you know,
I don't think,

1318
01:06:53,180 --> 01:06:54,013
I just think when you,
when you listen to a scientist talk 

1319
01:06:55,921 --> 01:07:00,921
about their dialects and the fact that 
the pod stays together for life and that

1320
01:07:00,951 --> 01:07:01,311
they,
uh,

1321
01:07:01,311 --> 01:07:02,144
they form these tight bonds and they 
communicate over great distances with 

1322
01:07:04,881 --> 01:07:05,714
sound frequencies and these complex 
languages that they recognize are 

1323
01:07:08,391 --> 01:07:09,224
different in different areas.
So they recognize they're similar 

1324
01:07:11,121 --> 01:07:12,800
sounds,
but there's a dialect to it.

1325
01:07:13,010 --> 01:07:14,960
They still don't know what the fuck 
they're saying.

1326
01:07:15,410 --> 01:07:17,750
And part of the reason why we don't want
know what they're saying,

1327
01:07:17,751 --> 01:07:21,320
it's just like how we were talking about
emojis being like a form of hieroglyphs.

1328
01:07:22,130 --> 01:07:25,790
I don't think we can understand the 
context of communication.

1329
01:07:25,791 --> 01:07:29,090
When you live in the fucking ocean and 
you kill fish with your face all day.

1330
01:07:29,510 --> 01:07:32,780
I think what we would think of is,
where is your house?

1331
01:07:33,110 --> 01:07:36,260
Do you guys have cable?
How do you guys find out about,

1332
01:07:36,380 --> 01:07:37,750
you know,
when the movies are playing,

1333
01:07:37,950 --> 01:07:41,150
know that this idea of communication to 
us,

1334
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:43,700
like what,
what they're trying to do is locate each

1335
01:07:43,701 --> 01:07:45,500
other,
let each other know their moods,

1336
01:07:45,530 --> 01:07:47,780
let each other know their whole right.
Let each other know.

1337
01:07:47,930 --> 01:07:49,510
But we think that,
that,

1338
01:07:49,580 --> 01:07:50,413
that's rudimentary in comparison to our 
complex system of sounds and very 

1339
01:07:55,311 --> 01:07:58,820
repeatable sounds that we can all 
express back and forth to each other.

1340
01:07:59,150 --> 01:08:02,570
But we just like emojis,
like what they're doing,

1341
01:08:04,650 --> 01:08:06,230
dressing themselves in,
in a,

1342
01:08:06,231 --> 01:08:07,940
in a way that they all understand.
Yeah.

1343
01:08:08,430 --> 01:08:09,263
Yeah man.
And don't forget they have an awareness 

1344
01:08:11,670 --> 01:08:14,580
of,
of part of the larger part of the earth.

1345
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:16,580
We don't know what the fuck is down 
there.

1346
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:17,630
Right.
That's one of the,

1347
01:08:17,900 --> 01:08:18,780
that's one of the,
uh,

1348
01:08:19,140 --> 01:08:19,973
moby Dick right after the spoiler.
They kill the fucking whale moby Dick 

1349
01:08:24,261 --> 01:08:25,940
back right after the,
in the description,

1350
01:08:26,930 --> 01:08:28,940
the description of the way they kill 
this fucking thing.

1351
01:08:28,941 --> 01:08:30,890
The way they did it back then,
which is you know,

1352
01:08:30,891 --> 01:08:32,930
you getting a ship,
you roll up to the thing,

1353
01:08:32,931 --> 01:08:35,630
there's a harpoon year,
he's got a fucking Harpoon,

1354
01:08:36,180 --> 01:08:39,740
he's got to sing it at the thing and 
then you've got a tire it out.

1355
01:08:39,741 --> 01:08:42,110
Real it.
And this is a fucking whale,

1356
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:44,000
right?
This is a Leviathan,

1357
01:08:44,001 --> 01:08:44,834
right?
You're just a little fucking human in a 

1358
01:08:46,251 --> 01:08:49,610
fucking boat and you're like nailing 
this thing with a harpoon.

1359
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,890
Finally,
when it gets tired enough,

1360
01:08:52,430 --> 01:08:54,140
you have to find its heart.

1361
01:08:54,430 --> 01:08:56,750
Oh my jam,
the Harpoon into its heart.

1362
01:08:56,960 --> 01:09:00,350
And then basically like fuck the whole 
with a Harpoon,

1363
01:09:00,351 --> 01:09:04,100
just jab it in and out of that fucking 
hole until finally,

1364
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:05,960
this is description makes you want to 
cry.

1365
01:09:05,961 --> 01:09:06,794
It's so awful.
Finally like the whale out of its blow 

1366
01:09:09,791 --> 01:09:13,610
hole at like shrieks like uh,
like car breaks or something.

1367
01:09:13,611 --> 01:09:14,444
Like it's screaming in pain and then it 
just blows chunks of guts and lung and 

1368
01:09:19,731 --> 01:09:23,150
heart out of its own glow.
And then it fucking dies.

1369
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:26,750
Then you got to get it back to the ship.
You tie it to this side of the ship.

1370
01:09:26,990 --> 01:09:30,050
Sharks start feasting on the fucking 
thing.

1371
01:09:30,051 --> 01:09:33,230
So you have like sharks and your God 
damn whale.

1372
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:34,333
It's somebody's job to get lower down 
with a Harpoon and kill the fucking 

1373
01:09:37,521 --> 01:09:40,610
sharks.
And Melville Describes Melville,

1374
01:09:40,611 --> 01:09:43,250
describes killing sharks.
He's like,

1375
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:44,233
you will stat,
you watched the hard paneer stab the 

1376
01:09:46,041 --> 01:09:46,670
shark.

1377
01:09:46,670 --> 01:09:50,030
The shark will start eating its own inch
rails cause it'll,

1378
01:09:50,031 --> 01:09:50,864
it'll just start eating itself.
And then just like tying itself up into 

1379
01:09:54,081 --> 01:09:56,540
a,
not as it eats itself in a frenzy.

1380
01:09:56,900 --> 01:10:00,560
That's our Melville describes it.
Those poor fucking whales man.

1381
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:02,180
But after the,
uh,

1382
01:10:02,330 --> 01:10:03,600
they kill a whale.
Ahab,

1383
01:10:03,620 --> 01:10:04,940
Captain Ahab,
poor sad,

1384
01:10:04,941 --> 01:10:05,774
Captain Ahab.
He comes out and he like does a funeral 

1385
01:10:08,931 --> 01:10:12,500
for the whales head.
And he like says like,

1386
01:10:12,770 --> 01:10:13,603
what have you seen down there?
What have you seen the graves of 

1387
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:19,273
millions of sailors,
the wrecked ships that no one will ever 

1388
01:10:23,661 --> 01:10:26,240
know or there,
that's what a whale see.

1389
01:10:26,241 --> 01:10:29,210
So they just have this awareness that we
don't like.

1390
01:10:29,450 --> 01:10:31,220
We'll never know what the fuck's down 
there.

1391
01:10:31,221 --> 01:10:33,290
We hardly can.
Yeah.

1392
01:10:33,291 --> 01:10:34,124
We don't know what like,
I mean the earth is three quarters 

1393
01:10:36,890 --> 01:10:37,640
water,
right?

1394
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:39,190
Yeah.
So the,

1395
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:40,680
what's the low?
Yeah.

1396
01:10:41,270 --> 01:10:44,060
What's below the water is a two thirds 
or three guide on.

1397
01:10:44,060 --> 01:10:46,160
Now there's a three,
five and measured lately.

1398
01:10:46,190 --> 01:10:47,330
Whatever it is,
it's a lot,

1399
01:10:47,331 --> 01:10:48,980
right?
It's a giant chunk of the earth.

1400
01:10:49,030 --> 01:10:49,821
Yes.
All water.

1401
01:10:49,821 --> 01:10:54,740
That's why it blew the,
the underneath stuff we so rarely see.

1402
01:10:54,741 --> 01:10:55,640
I mean,
do we see it?

1403
01:10:56,030 --> 01:10:58,880
Is that we do we see at 1% of what we 
see above ground?

1404
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:00,870
The um,
Oh God,

1405
01:11:00,871 --> 01:11:03,170
I hate to always talk about it,
but a brief history,

1406
01:11:03,171 --> 01:11:05,060
nearly everything he describes it as 
like,

1407
01:11:05,570 --> 01:11:06,650
and this could be wrong,
I don't know,

1408
01:11:06,651 --> 01:11:07,484
but what we know about the ocean,
imagine if someone took like six 

1409
01:11:10,041 --> 01:11:15,041
tractors and drop them in the middle of 
Middle America and they drove around for

1410
01:11:15,991 --> 01:11:19,460
a few nights with their lights on at 
night.

1411
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:23,710
Some,
some description like that.

1412
01:11:23,711 --> 01:11:24,980
Can't remember.
But it's like it's,

1413
01:11:25,170 --> 01:11:26,003
it's that limited because getting a 
fucking thing underneath all that 

1414
01:11:28,211 --> 01:11:30,520
pressure,
it's not going to break down.

1415
01:11:30,521 --> 01:11:33,100
Getting out there in the first place,
you know,

1416
01:11:33,101 --> 01:11:35,710
to get the thing down that can survive 
that pressure.

1417
01:11:35,890 --> 01:11:37,940
Forget it.
Pasta takes a

1418
01:11:38,210 --> 01:11:41,630
special kind of crazy person that's 
willing to get in a submarine.

1419
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:44,630
Oh,
oh Jesus fucking Christ.

1420
01:11:44,690 --> 01:11:45,523
I think I'd rather go to space.
I think I'd rather go to space and be 

1421
01:11:47,961 --> 01:11:52,700
stuck at the bottom of the fucking Osha 
and then see a drop of water on the side

1422
01:11:52,701 --> 01:11:54,020
of the wall going,
what is that?

1423
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:56,300
What is that?
What's going on?

1424
01:11:56,301 --> 01:11:56,870
Shit,
man.

1425
01:11:56,870 --> 01:11:58,450
What is that noise?
Did you hear that noise here?

1426
01:11:58,800 --> 01:11:59,740
Yeah.
Twinkie.

1427
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:01,850
And you know,
it's just like a fucking beer.

1428
01:12:01,851 --> 01:12:03,020
Can I,
one of those?

1429
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:05,130
You ever see a stripper crush a beer can
with their tin.

1430
01:12:06,020 --> 01:12:08,570
They hold a beer can up and they have 
one of them whopper tits,

1431
01:12:08,571 --> 01:12:09,404
like those double f jammies and they 
hold it by the base because those tits 

1432
01:12:12,591 --> 01:12:13,820
are always like,
you know,

1433
01:12:13,821 --> 01:12:14,930
they're,
they're sort of like a,

1434
01:12:14,931 --> 01:12:17,540
like a ball on the end of a,
an old rope.

1435
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:18,051
Right.
You know,

1436
01:12:18,051 --> 01:12:22,700
cause you have the big round ridiculous 
sized implants and they hold the beer.

1437
01:12:22,701 --> 01:12:25,730
Can they just molly whopped up beer can 
and crush it.

1438
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:27,553
That's how I would feel if I heard a 
clink clink clink that I knew that 

1439
01:12:30,951 --> 01:12:35,090
eventually the thousands of pounds of 
pressure was just going to smush that,

1440
01:12:36,110 --> 01:12:37,940
that tank.
I just,

1441
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:40,340
that's a fucked up way to diamond here.
They go,

1442
01:12:40,341 --> 01:12:40,821
look,
look,

1443
01:12:40,821 --> 01:12:41,654
look,
look behind you.

1444
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:44,240
Boom.
Oh Wow.

1445
01:12:44,241 --> 01:12:47,330
I didn't know this.
They do this boom boom,

1446
01:12:47,900 --> 01:12:50,970
which is crushing them with her tits.
That has to hurt.

1447
01:12:50,971 --> 01:12:54,720
We'll get Steve Harvey.
Hmm.

1448
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:56,360
There you go.
Wow.

1449
01:12:56,630 --> 01:12:58,670
Now you know it's a thing.
Now I know.

1450
01:12:58,730 --> 01:13:01,430
So that's what I think of when I think 
about submarines.

1451
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:02,450
You think when she did that?

1452
01:13:08,670 --> 01:13:09,630
Yeah.
Man.

1453
01:13:09,990 --> 01:13:11,940
You think she did that the first time 
she did that?

1454
01:13:11,941 --> 01:13:12,774
She was angry?

1455
01:13:14,060 --> 01:13:16,760
No,
she was on meth the first time for sure.

1456
01:13:16,820 --> 01:13:17,930
Is that what she said?
No,

1457
01:13:17,931 --> 01:13:20,120
that's what I would guess.
I think a lot of girls have done that.

1458
01:13:20,121 --> 01:13:22,580
That's a trick.
That's like the when you not,

1459
01:13:22,581 --> 01:13:25,760
but she keeps sucking.
That's that mixed boobs.

1460
01:13:25,970 --> 01:13:26,803
Crushing beards.
First girl to crush a beer can with her 

1461
01:13:30,711 --> 01:13:32,150
boob was on match.
No,

1462
01:13:32,151 --> 01:13:33,980
she's probably a real girl.
First of all,

1463
01:13:34,010 --> 01:13:35,210
like she had real boobs.
I mean,

1464
01:13:35,570 --> 01:13:36,950
not just a real girl.
Yeah.

1465
01:13:36,980 --> 01:13:39,650
You're all real girls by the way,
and everybody's a real girl.

1466
01:13:39,670 --> 01:13:40,790
Yeah.
If you want to be a real girl,

1467
01:13:40,791 --> 01:13:42,020
you're a real girl.
Right?

1468
01:13:42,350 --> 01:13:43,183
Right.
But like how many guys are broken beer 

1469
01:13:45,081 --> 01:13:46,790
cans with their dick?
How about zero?

1470
01:13:47,900 --> 01:13:49,970
Tits are way more powerful and Dick in 
that regard,

1471
01:13:50,310 --> 01:13:55,310
and what guys ever like held a beer can 
down and smashed it with his hog oak has

1472
01:13:56,331 --> 01:13:59,960
a greater man than anybody in this room.
Plus,

1473
01:14:00,140 --> 01:14:04,340
especially if he does it right side up 
and he gets the lip of the,

1474
01:14:04,550 --> 01:14:05,383
the beer can the thin park slams against
his dick with the kind of force that's 

1475
01:14:09,711 --> 01:14:11,980
required to bend a beer can.
You're going to

1476
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:13,330
crush your deck,
you're going to hurt your Dick.

1477
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:14,320
I gotta disagree with you,
man.

1478
01:14:14,350 --> 01:14:15,183
I think he becomes,
I think he becomes the hero if he's 

1479
01:14:19,571 --> 01:14:20,404
like,
if he's tied up and he's got to use his 

1480
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:26,470
dick and the beer can as a form of 
escape device,

1481
01:14:26,471 --> 01:14:31,180
like at that point it becomes more 
heroic than just,

1482
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:31,961
but you're right.
I mean,

1483
01:14:31,961 --> 01:14:35,530
no matter what,
if you smash a beer can with your cock,

1484
01:14:35,890 --> 01:14:40,030
then you join some invisible,
more elite than the Illuminati.

1485
01:14:40,060 --> 01:14:43,660
I bet it's smaller than the seven 
families that control everything.

1486
01:14:43,990 --> 01:14:44,823
Do you think there's like a 14 inch club
was all dudes were 14 to talks just 

1487
01:14:48,881 --> 01:14:49,714
hanging out.

1488
01:14:51,580 --> 01:14:52,413
There's gotta be more than one dude on 
the planet that has more than a foot 

1489
01:14:55,001 --> 01:14:56,200
long duck.
Right?

1490
01:14:56,680 --> 01:14:58,000
If there's girls that have kids like 
that,

1491
01:14:58,001 --> 01:15:00,250
and obviously those are fake,
but people are weird,

1492
01:15:00,251 --> 01:15:01,360
right?
People are built strange.

1493
01:15:01,361 --> 01:15:04,210
There's guys that are seven feet tall.
There's people that are five foot one.

1494
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:05,473
There's a whole bunch of people in 
between and someone out there as a 14 

1495
01:15:08,411 --> 01:15:11,050
inch Dick for sure.
Like how many of them?

1496
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:16,800
Well I mean based on my own experience.
Three and they're all assholes.

1497
01:15:19,510 --> 01:15:24,510
But well there was that one guy who kept
getting caught at the TSA because he has

1498
01:15:24,570 --> 01:15:24,940
his,
his,

1499
01:15:24,940 --> 01:15:27,360
his hog is gigantic.
So he,

1500
01:15:27,580 --> 01:15:29,690
I keep saying hog cause it's fun.
Yeah.

1501
01:15:29,700 --> 01:15:31,270
Why is you calling her a log?
What are you 12?

1502
01:15:31,420 --> 01:15:33,200
Yes.
Um,

1503
01:15:33,250 --> 01:15:36,850
he's got a like a fucking sock.
Like a rolled up sock.

1504
01:15:36,940 --> 01:15:37,773
Yeah.
That's what is his hog is we know the 

1505
01:15:38,711 --> 01:15:40,680
story or we've probably talked about in 
the park,

1506
01:15:40,690 --> 01:15:42,400
you know the story of John Malcovich,
right.

1507
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:45,460
Being John Malkovich comp,
John Malcovich the actor.

1508
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:46,353
Right,
right.

1509
01:15:46,450 --> 01:15:47,283
So that supposedly they had to get him a
body double and a nude scene in a movie 

1510
01:15:50,950 --> 01:15:51,783
because his cock is so gigantic that 
they thought nobody would believe that 

1511
01:15:55,091 --> 01:15:55,924
was a human's Dick.
So they had to get a body devil with a 

1512
01:15:58,391 --> 01:16:00,840
smaller cock to,
uh,

1513
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:01,713
have him stand in.
Because his penis is so large that it 

1514
01:16:05,291 --> 01:16:06,124
would disrupt the flow of the narrative 
to the guy who's telling you this suck 

1515
01:16:09,731 --> 01:16:10,564
your Dick.
He'd said it while he was sucking my 

1516
01:16:12,311 --> 01:16:17,311
Dick and the WHO I believe our biggest 
dangers,

1517
01:16:19,850 --> 01:16:21,640
his dick,
a survey they're looking at.

1518
01:16:22,150 --> 01:16:24,780
I think it is.
It feels lucky enough phonies.

1519
01:16:24,860 --> 01:16:27,040
They look up as if that's confirmed 
somewhere.

1520
01:16:27,070 --> 01:16:27,903
I think it's confirmed.
I have a feeling that's what's called a 

1521
01:16:30,521 --> 01:16:31,354
rumor.
I have a feeling John Malcovich has a 

1522
01:16:32,501 --> 01:16:34,110
great publicist.
Yeah.

1523
01:16:34,300 --> 01:16:37,270
He's like this story.
That's a good move.

1524
01:16:37,630 --> 01:16:38,131
Well,
if I,

1525
01:16:38,131 --> 01:16:39,760
I could imagine he would have a giant 
hug.

1526
01:16:40,150 --> 01:16:40,983
James Woods supposedly has a giant hug.
That's the word he's telling him about 

1527
01:16:44,381 --> 01:16:45,670
it.
He's talked about it pretty openly.

1528
01:16:45,700 --> 01:16:48,330
Trump trump has a giant one did.
He says,

1529
01:16:48,340 --> 01:16:49,173
fine.
He says it's fine in comparison to his 

1530
01:16:51,131 --> 01:16:52,960
hands,
but it's the fact that the guy's running

1531
01:16:52,961 --> 01:16:56,170
for president and he was joking around 
about his dick not being tiny.

1532
01:16:56,230 --> 01:16:58,840
That is hilarious.
I don't,

1533
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:00,153
you know,
I don't know if he's going to make the 

1534
01:17:00,761 --> 01:17:02,710
best leader of the free world,
but,

1535
01:17:02,711 --> 01:17:03,544
uh,
I welcome someone who's willing to make 

1536
01:17:05,291 --> 01:17:07,210
a dick joke while they're running for 
president.

1537
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:08,470
I welcome that.
Well,

1538
01:17:08,530 --> 01:17:10,100
it's going,
it's like,

1539
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:11,420
it's gonna be,
uh,

1540
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:14,960
it's going to be a,
it's going to be really,

1541
01:17:14,961 --> 01:17:16,520
um,
interesting.

1542
01:17:16,521 --> 01:17:17,810
You know,
I was thinking,

1543
01:17:17,820 --> 01:17:19,460
we were talking about the fucking 
elections anyway,

1544
01:17:19,461 --> 01:17:20,630
man.
And,

1545
01:17:20,631 --> 01:17:22,040
uh,
you know,

1546
01:17:22,041 --> 01:17:23,480
what's causing all the trouble right 
now?

1547
01:17:24,110 --> 01:17:25,790
What?
It's this,

1548
01:17:25,930 --> 01:17:28,610
it's,
this is all technological disruption.

1549
01:17:28,820 --> 01:17:31,970
Like we're looking at,
this is all a result of technology.

1550
01:17:31,971 --> 01:17:33,650
I was thinking like,
what's the,

1551
01:17:33,651 --> 01:17:35,660
um,
what's the F if,

1552
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:39,050
okay.
If you could like locate the problem,

1553
01:17:39,290 --> 01:17:40,850
right?
It's the,

1554
01:17:43,070 --> 01:17:46,940
I don't mean to jump from a damn 
fantastic conversation about an enormous

1555
01:17:46,941 --> 01:17:47,774
cox to some kind of political shit ever 
worry about where our conversations go 

1556
01:17:51,411 --> 01:17:53,030
lover.
So thank you.

1557
01:17:53,510 --> 01:17:54,410
So,
so,

1558
01:17:54,411 --> 01:17:55,520
uh,
the,

1559
01:17:55,521 --> 01:17:56,081
the,
the,

1560
01:17:56,081 --> 01:17:57,620
the,
what you're looking at here,

1561
01:17:57,621 --> 01:17:58,550
man,
is,

1562
01:17:58,551 --> 01:18:00,510
uh,
what Ray Kerr,

1563
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:04,280
this is a quote from Ray Kurzweil,
which is things aren't getting worse.

1564
01:18:04,281 --> 01:18:06,350
Our information's getting better,
right?

1565
01:18:06,620 --> 01:18:11,620
And so with Hillary Clinton,
who is a career politician,

1566
01:18:13,790 --> 01:18:14,623
right?

1567
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:18,080
And we've all known since we were young.
Most people,

1568
01:18:18,081 --> 01:18:20,120
I think when they think about 
politicians,

1569
01:18:20,121 --> 01:18:22,520
they don't think those are some honest 
people.

1570
01:18:22,521 --> 01:18:24,590
Those politicians,
they usually,

1571
01:18:24,591 --> 01:18:28,310
you're telling the truth.
I think most of his think politicians,

1572
01:18:28,550 --> 01:18:30,440
they lie,
they warp things,

1573
01:18:30,441 --> 01:18:31,274
they fabricate things.
They use a form of deception to gain 

1574
01:18:34,881 --> 01:18:38,780
control of various power structures.
That's what the animal does.

1575
01:18:38,930 --> 01:18:39,763
So that's not new information when you 
find out that Hillary Clinton and the 

1576
01:18:44,061 --> 01:18:44,894
DNC,
and I don't know if they completely 

1577
01:18:46,521 --> 01:18:49,280
connected those two,
but when you find out that they,

1578
01:18:49,730 --> 01:18:51,050
they,
they were not,

1579
01:18:51,420 --> 01:18:52,253
uh,
they didn't do what they're supposed to 

1580
01:18:52,671 --> 01:18:53,504
do.
They helped Hillary Clinton become the 

1581
01:18:55,791 --> 01:18:59,960
Democratic nominee and they actively 
tried to fuck up Bernie Sanders.

1582
01:18:59,961 --> 01:19:01,310
Right.
That's creepy.

1583
01:19:01,370 --> 01:19:01,540
Yeah.

1584
01:19:01,540 --> 01:19:03,630
What?
It's not a new thing.

1585
01:19:03,690 --> 01:19:04,710
I know,
but it is creepy.

1586
01:19:04,711 --> 01:19:07,260
It's creepy.
And it's even more creepy that the woman

1587
01:19:07,261 --> 01:19:08,094
who was in charge resigns and then 
immediately gets hired a great shot and 

1588
01:19:11,700 --> 01:19:13,440
got a great job.
Hillary Clinton's like,

1589
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:14,333
fuck it.
I'm going to hire you and it won't do 

1590
01:19:16,291 --> 01:19:17,940
anything.
She hires her.

1591
01:19:18,060 --> 01:19:23,060
She's so fucking unafraid of what's 
going to happen that she hires the woman

1592
01:19:23,580 --> 01:19:27,600
who did such shitty thing.
She had to resign booed off stage,

1593
01:19:27,780 --> 01:19:30,780
hires her into her fucking party cause 
she's like,

1594
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:33,450
fuck you,
I'm getting elected.

1595
01:19:33,660 --> 01:19:35,370
You're not stopping it.
Right.

1596
01:19:35,490 --> 01:19:39,330
But this is again tech.
It's gangster too though.

1597
01:19:39,990 --> 01:19:40,823
It's also a move in on her part where,
I mean she's looking at like what trump 

1598
01:19:45,121 --> 01:19:47,460
is calling her crooked hillary.
Yeah.

1599
01:19:47,580 --> 01:19:51,330
It's a gangster move to hire a woman 
like that.

1600
01:19:51,331 --> 01:19:52,770
Like right in front of you.
Yeah.

1601
01:19:52,771 --> 01:19:57,690
Wasserman Schultz top post mission 
accomplished the DNC.

1602
01:19:57,740 --> 01:19:59,550
But this is,
this is not a new,

1603
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:02,520
this is not a new thing man.
This is what exactly,

1604
01:20:02,521 --> 01:20:05,700
well let's go over this.
Cause what exactly did they do that's so

1605
01:20:05,701 --> 01:20:07,920
awful about Bernie?
What did they do?

1606
01:20:07,950 --> 01:20:08,230
So

1607
01:20:08,230 --> 01:20:11,670
they apparently came up with a way to 
disseminate information to the press,

1608
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:15,900
highlighting certain aspects of Bernie 
Sanders that would be unappealing to the

1609
01:20:15,901 --> 01:20:16,734
voter.
And they did

1610
01:20:16,830 --> 01:20:18,420
this.
And this has all been confirmed.

1611
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:19,321
Can you,
can you,

1612
01:20:19,321 --> 01:20:20,310
uh,
Google that?

1613
01:20:20,370 --> 01:20:21,203
Find out what they actually said.
Let's find out what the actually 

1614
01:20:22,741 --> 01:20:23,574
summarize the Wiki leave.
We think they're being a bunch of whiny 

1615
01:20:25,651 --> 01:20:27,960
bitches,
but for sure they wanted him look,

1616
01:20:27,961 --> 01:20:28,794
she's got way deeper arms in politics.
She's way more connected than he is for 

1617
01:20:32,551 --> 01:20:33,210
sure.
There's,

1618
01:20:33,210 --> 01:20:34,043
and this is what we're seeing too,
there's like a big part of being a 

1619
01:20:35,671 --> 01:20:38,190
political candidate is how many favors 
do you have?

1620
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:40,140
How many people you are you connected 
to,

1621
01:20:40,160 --> 01:20:42,120
how,
how deep does your influence go?

1622
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:43,433
And obviously her influence didn't just 
sit within her are her own little group 

1623
01:20:47,581 --> 01:20:50,640
of people that were working for it had 
gotten to the DNC itself.

1624
01:20:50,641 --> 01:20:51,474
So she's,
she's deeply embedded in this whole 

1625
01:20:53,161 --> 01:20:53,994
system,
whether it's because of friendships or 

1626
01:20:55,021 --> 01:20:58,590
ideologies or people just wanted her,
she's the chosen one.

1627
01:20:58,590 --> 01:21:01,260
Whatever reason,
whatever deals were made or whoever,

1628
01:21:01,290 --> 01:21:02,123
who knows who knows what it is.
But when you find out that an 

1629
01:21:03,931 --> 01:21:05,940
organization that's supposed to be the 
head,

1630
01:21:06,150 --> 01:21:07,260
it's supposed to be,
if we,

1631
01:21:07,350 --> 01:21:08,183
if everything was on the up and up,
it's supposed to be objective and 

1632
01:21:11,011 --> 01:21:13,410
looking for what the people want or as 
the best party.

1633
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:15,390
But no,
they're actually actively steering,

1634
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:16,673
which is massively corrupt and kind of 
scary because if these people are 

1635
01:21:19,771 --> 01:21:20,604
deciding to steer an entire party yeah.
Which is 50% of a political process 

1636
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:26,190
because there's no,
look,

1637
01:21:26,370 --> 01:21:27,203
you've,
we've got libertarian party for the 

1638
01:21:27,961 --> 01:21:29,460
first time,
people are taking Gary Johnson.

1639
01:21:29,461 --> 01:21:30,510
Seriously,
it's going to do that.

1640
01:21:30,570 --> 01:21:31,403
Um,
uh,

1641
01:21:31,630 --> 01:21:34,470
a town hall debate on Wednesday or town 
hall,

1642
01:21:34,471 --> 01:21:36,810
one of those town hall things on 
Wednesday on CNN,

1643
01:21:37,110 --> 01:21:40,710
but for the most part it's Democrats or 
Republicans in most people's eyes.

1644
01:21:40,840 --> 01:21:44,970
So what they're essentially doing is 
rigging half of that process.

1645
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,160
Yup.
That's carrie that we just,

1646
01:21:47,310 --> 01:21:48,870
we don't think anything's wrong with 
that,

1647
01:21:48,871 --> 01:21:49,704
but we put Martha Stewart in jail for 
not telling exactly the truth about 

1648
01:21:52,951 --> 01:21:55,480
where she bought and sold stocks or 
whatever the fuck

1649
01:21:55,650 --> 01:21:58,650
we eat about.
We do think something's wrong about it,

1650
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:02,550
but we can't do anything about it.
We do think something's wrong,

1651
01:22:02,670 --> 01:22:04,290
but right now,
okay,

1652
01:22:04,291 --> 01:22:05,124
so if like that institution is corrupt 
and if the Republican institution is in 

1653
01:22:09,631 --> 01:22:13,500
some ways corrupt,
I think it might be safe to say,

1654
01:22:14,130 --> 01:22:14,963
and I don't think too many people would 
be outraged at the idea that there is a 

1655
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:19,793
institutionalized corruption in the 
entire American political system and 

1656
01:22:24,571 --> 01:22:27,870
it's very similar to the problem that 
happens in bike racing.

1657
01:22:28,140 --> 01:22:28,973
If one mother fucker regs their bike or 
gets on fucking doping stuff that can't 

1658
01:22:33,571 --> 01:22:36,540
be detected.
If you want to have a fair advantage,

1659
01:22:36,750 --> 01:22:39,660
you've got a regular bike and start 
doping to,

1660
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:42,390
or the person who rides their bike will 
always win.

1661
01:22:42,540 --> 01:22:46,860
So if politics is a competition,
which it clearly is,

1662
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:47,873
and if members of the competition are 
using nefarious means to achieve their 

1663
01:22:52,501 --> 01:22:53,970
goals,
which they clearly are,

1664
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:57,360
which they clearly are,
then that would imply that if you wanted

1665
01:22:57,361 --> 01:22:58,194
to survive in that system,
you would also have to use nefarious 

1666
01:23:01,561 --> 01:23:03,430
means dom,
dom,

1667
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:09,460
and this is not new.
This is old,

1668
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:11,020
old,
old shit.

1669
01:23:11,021 --> 01:23:11,854
What's new is technology.
What's new is now people like Julian 

1670
01:23:17,021 --> 01:23:21,850
assange are shining a light on the 
corruption and his whole ideas.

1671
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:22,833
If I reveal this information,
it will force reform via the outrage of 

1672
01:23:28,151 --> 01:23:28,984
the people who are supposed to be 
represented by a person who's breaking 

1673
01:23:32,471 --> 01:23:34,150
the law.
That's his idea.

1674
01:23:34,300 --> 01:23:35,133
We need reform.
And right now we're at the point where 

1675
01:23:37,721 --> 01:23:38,554
it's very similar to when you're in a 
family and this is one of the worst 

1676
01:23:41,171 --> 01:23:42,610
things can fucking happen,
man.

1677
01:23:42,970 --> 01:23:43,803
In a family.
If there is somebody who's molesting 

1678
01:23:46,361 --> 01:23:48,320
somebody,
it happens all the time where,

1679
01:23:48,380 --> 01:23:50,620
uh,
a father or a brother,

1680
01:23:50,830 --> 01:23:53,980
we'll start fucking molesting somebody,
right?

1681
01:23:54,190 --> 01:23:59,190
But in people in the family know it,
but they don't do anything about it.

1682
01:23:59,410 --> 01:24:00,243
Because to talk about what GRANDPA does 
every couple of years means that 

1683
01:24:04,711 --> 01:24:09,711
complete disintegration of the fucking 
family and apocalypse for the family and

1684
01:24:11,291 --> 01:24:14,590
the same way is more of these 
revelations become clear,

1685
01:24:14,620 --> 01:24:15,700
which we always knew.

1686
01:24:15,940 --> 01:24:18,280
But you could always float into a happy 
place and be like,

1687
01:24:18,281 --> 01:24:20,590
Nah,
I'm just being a conspiracy dude.

1688
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:25,600
I'm sure the stuff they're doing up on 
Capitol Hill is all fair and square.

1689
01:24:25,880 --> 01:24:26,291
I,
you know,

1690
01:24:26,291 --> 01:24:28,720
you can just believe it guiding.
You just pretend to believe.

1691
01:24:29,020 --> 01:24:31,360
Now it's like,
well now you're wrong.

1692
01:24:31,361 --> 01:24:32,080
Look,
hey,

1693
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:35,200
here's the fucking proof and here's 
going to be more proof and there's going

1694
01:24:35,201 --> 01:24:36,034
to be more proof and there's going to be
more proof until finally the American 

1695
01:24:39,461 --> 01:24:41,950
people are going to have to either just 
be like,

1696
01:24:42,820 --> 01:24:43,653
oh,
I'm just going to believe that fours 

1697
01:24:45,550 --> 01:24:46,383
three and three is four because I have a
nice comfortable life and I don't want 

1698
01:24:50,651 --> 01:24:52,720
to fucking deal with this shit,
man.

1699
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:55,740
I'm just going to trust the banks 
because the banks light,

1700
01:24:55,870 --> 01:24:59,680
they like money and at my job and as 
long as I keep my job,

1701
01:24:59,681 --> 01:25:00,760
I'll keep my benefits.

1702
01:25:00,790 --> 01:25:02,200
Yeah,
and by the way,

1703
01:25:02,201 --> 01:25:03,400
ps,
man,

1704
01:25:03,610 --> 01:25:04,443
when you consider that,
it's like there's something pragmatic 

1705
01:25:07,151 --> 01:25:09,010
about that.
As sad as it is.

1706
01:25:09,170 --> 01:25:10,060
There's as,
as,

1707
01:25:10,300 --> 01:25:11,800
as depressing it is,
is it is,

1708
01:25:11,801 --> 01:25:12,634
but they're,
the real awful problem is that this 

1709
01:25:17,591 --> 01:25:18,424
country,
I think is that they get metaphysical 

1710
01:25:20,171 --> 01:25:21,004
machine that was built by some very 
intelligent people who understood the 

1711
01:25:25,031 --> 01:25:29,740
energy flow that comes through a society
and the elections were supposed to be an

1712
01:25:29,770 --> 01:25:30,603
outlet valve for the pressure that 
builds up when people feel that they're 

1713
01:25:33,551 --> 01:25:34,930
being repressed.
Right.

1714
01:25:35,260 --> 01:25:36,093
And if you start fucking with that 
output valve by putting up fake 

1715
01:25:39,431 --> 01:25:44,200
politicians that don't truly represent 
the people and hope that the people will

1716
01:25:44,201 --> 01:25:46,390
believe that they have elected these 
people,

1717
01:25:46,630 --> 01:25:50,590
if you put two shitty choices in front 
of us and we're supposed to look at that

1718
01:25:50,591 --> 01:25:51,610
and be like,
okay,

1719
01:25:52,060 --> 01:25:54,500
everything's fine,
then you're,

1720
01:25:54,790 --> 01:25:55,623
you're missing the point,
which is that there is an energetic 

1721
01:25:57,971 --> 01:26:00,220
system that needs to get released.

1722
01:26:00,680 --> 01:26:03,440
You know,
at some point the energy's got to out.

1723
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:05,840
If it doesn't go out,
you get revolution.

1724
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:09,050
That's the way the energy goes out the 
wrong way.

1725
01:26:09,230 --> 01:26:12,560
The idea is let's fucking the American 
revolution,

1726
01:26:12,860 --> 01:26:14,090
brutal,
bloody,

1727
01:26:14,210 --> 01:26:16,820
awful fucked.
These geniuses,

1728
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,670
many of them freemasons got together and
they were like,

1729
01:26:19,671 --> 01:26:20,504
you know what?
Is there a way that we can program 

1730
01:26:22,611 --> 01:26:23,444
history so that a society doesn't 
destroy itself intermittently with a 

1731
01:26:27,291 --> 01:26:29,750
fucking revolution?
Because if we could do that,

1732
01:26:29,960 --> 01:26:30,793
we'll build one of the most powerful 
never ending societies on earth because 

1733
01:26:34,881 --> 01:26:38,930
we figured out a way to outflow the 
pressure that builds up.

1734
01:26:39,140 --> 01:26:39,973
So when you start fucking with a goddamn
political system and pretend that 

1735
01:26:42,621 --> 01:26:45,560
everything's gonna be okay,
you are missing,

1736
01:26:45,650 --> 01:26:50,120
I think the the point which is that 
people who are very smart,

1737
01:26:50,270 --> 01:26:51,103
maybe a lot smarter than then the 
politicians we have today recognize 

1738
01:26:55,071 --> 01:26:57,200
something,
built a thing and said,

1739
01:26:57,201 --> 01:27:01,280
let's just trust the fucking people.
Let's trust the people release the steam

1740
01:27:01,490 --> 01:27:04,910
and while ah,
everything runs according to plan.

1741
01:27:05,150 --> 01:27:08,360
Now the gears are a little fucking 
gummed up man.

1742
01:27:08,570 --> 01:27:09,740
A little,
yeah,

1743
01:27:10,190 --> 01:27:14,510
a little how gummed up?
How gummed up the gears.

1744
01:27:14,840 --> 01:27:15,673
Really crazy gummed up.
I think this is the first time we're 

1745
01:27:17,721 --> 01:27:20,990
realizing how much money people make by 
running for president.

1746
01:27:21,470 --> 01:27:22,130
How much,
you know,

1747
01:27:22,130 --> 01:27:25,970
money it costs to run for president.
But how much money top political figures

1748
01:27:25,971 --> 01:27:28,700
make and donations and in speeches.
Yeah.

1749
01:27:28,790 --> 01:27:30,230
Have you,
have you paid attention to how much they

1750
01:27:30,231 --> 01:27:33,650
make and speeches like Rudy Giuliani and
Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton,

1751
01:27:33,730 --> 01:27:35,060
you may,
may bribes.

1752
01:27:35,210 --> 01:27:36,410
Well,
this is what it is.

1753
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:41,440
These corporations can fund various,
uh,

1754
01:27:41,481 --> 01:27:42,314
universities.
They can donate money to all sorts of 

1755
01:27:45,291 --> 01:27:46,124
different programs where they would have
someone speak and they can decide who 

1756
01:27:49,881 --> 01:27:51,530
gets to speak and who doesn't get to 
speak.

1757
01:27:51,710 --> 01:27:53,930
And they also have like the Clinton 
Foundation,

1758
01:27:54,110 --> 01:27:58,370
people donate money into that.
They don't donate fuck loads of money.

1759
01:27:58,390 --> 01:27:59,570
Now it's her,
all these things,

1760
01:27:59,571 --> 01:28:01,310
but hold on a second says all these 
things,

1761
01:28:01,630 --> 01:28:02,990
what they are essentially,
or you're,

1762
01:28:02,991 --> 01:28:07,370
you're paying someone to speak for an 
hour and you're gonna give him $750,000.

1763
01:28:07,370 --> 01:28:08,960
And you want me to pretend that that's 
normal.

1764
01:28:09,620 --> 01:28:11,810
That's crazy.
And what does this person do?

1765
01:28:11,830 --> 01:28:13,880
They are a public servant.
Okay.

1766
01:28:14,180 --> 01:28:15,410
Okay.
So there are public servant,

1767
01:28:15,411 --> 01:28:20,150
and while they're publicly serving,
they're also making $750,000

1768
01:28:20,151 --> 01:28:21,410
to talk.
Huh?

1769
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:23,510
That seems a little crazy,
doesn't it?

1770
01:28:23,750 --> 01:28:24,583
Like why do they make so much money to 
do that and who was paying them and 

1771
01:28:26,751 --> 01:28:27,380
what,
what,

1772
01:28:27,380 --> 01:28:31,880
what do you have to benefit by having 
them come and read some nonsense,

1773
01:28:31,990 --> 01:28:34,190
bullshit,
boring speech.

1774
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:35,233
A friend mine went to see Rudy Giuliani 
after post nine one one when he was on 

1775
01:28:37,371 --> 01:28:38,204
his victory tour,
he was on like a lap of the country 

1776
01:28:40,191 --> 01:28:41,024
doing these,
these speeches because everybody loved 

1777
01:28:42,231 --> 01:28:44,590
him because he saved the world during,
you know,

1778
01:28:44,930 --> 01:28:46,940
September 11th he was the guy who stood 
strong,

1779
01:28:46,941 --> 01:28:48,540
everybody like wow,
rudy Giuliani,

1780
01:28:48,541 --> 01:28:49,374
he's a good man.
So he rode that and he started doing 

1781
01:28:50,181 --> 01:28:51,014
these speeches and would come to 
colleges and a friend of mine went to 

1782
01:28:52,881 --> 01:28:56,300
see him and said it was dog shit that he
just,

1783
01:28:56,301 --> 01:29:00,830
it was a boring ass like reading with no
passion.

1784
01:29:00,860 --> 01:29:01,693
It a chick chain.
Go in there and say some nonsense about 

1785
01:29:04,441 --> 01:29:08,100
freedom and the American way and 
terrorism or whatever the fuck and first

1786
01:29:08,101 --> 01:29:11,790
responders and just there wasn't 
anything real.

1787
01:29:11,850 --> 01:29:13,500
It was just,
it was a performance.

1788
01:29:13,620 --> 01:29:14,453
It was like he was doing a one man show 
all across the country for exorbitant 

1789
01:29:17,641 --> 01:29:19,350
sums of money.
God,

1790
01:29:19,351 --> 01:29:22,290
that'd be fucking great if he was 
actually doing a one man show,

1791
01:29:22,330 --> 01:29:23,163
hundred and $53 million in bill and 
Hillary Clinton speaking fees 

1792
01:29:27,580 --> 01:29:29,010
documented.
This is just,

1793
01:29:29,011 --> 01:29:33,690
Jamie just pulled this up.
That dad is stunning.

1794
01:29:33,900 --> 01:29:34,733
That's s dunning amount of money and 
what we're 15 years is from 2001 to 

1795
01:29:39,931 --> 01:29:42,750
about now it's it still it's more than,
yeah,

1796
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:44,120
that's mean.
Well,

1797
01:29:44,130 --> 01:29:46,080
it's perfect then because that's $10 
million a year.

1798
01:29:46,200 --> 01:29:51,200
This is more recent of what she,
she had 20 225,000

1799
01:29:52,291 --> 01:29:54,750
that's our standard fee.
Oh my God.

1800
01:29:55,380 --> 01:29:59,730
She prefers a private jet and prefers a 
gulfstream four 50 or larger.

1801
01:29:59,910 --> 01:30:03,450
The memo outlines had Clinton requires 
travel by private jet.

1802
01:30:03,940 --> 01:30:04,670
Yeah.

1803
01:30:04,670 --> 01:30:06,080
You know,
it'd be fucking cold out.

1804
01:30:06,260 --> 01:30:08,690
Is this like what if you are like a mad 
billionaire?

1805
01:30:08,691 --> 01:30:09,524
Could you just get Hillary Clinton to 
come to your house and like just speak 

1806
01:30:12,141 --> 01:30:14,030
to you for an hour and your living room?

1807
01:30:14,840 --> 01:30:17,670
This is fascinating.
Hold up,

1808
01:30:17,710 --> 01:30:20,410
scroll back down there.
She made $21 million doing what?

1809
01:30:20,740 --> 01:30:24,160
She made 21 point $6 million in speeches
and just under two years.

1810
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:29,020
That's amazing.
That's incredible.

1811
01:30:29,021 --> 01:30:29,854
That's so much money.
She's like a kind of like crazy animal 

1812
01:30:32,801 --> 01:30:36,070
that you can like lure with money.
Like you can actually,

1813
01:30:36,610 --> 01:30:40,180
if you have enough money you can learn 
to Hillary Clinton into your house.

1814
01:30:40,181 --> 01:30:42,310
Like you just have to lay it out.
She'll show up.

1815
01:30:42,311 --> 01:30:45,220
Like if I put carrots in my backyard,
I'll probably get a rabbit or two.

1816
01:30:45,490 --> 01:30:49,150
If you have enough money you can get 
politicians to come and start feeding it

1817
01:30:49,151 --> 01:30:50,510
your mansion.
Where do you,

1818
01:30:50,530 --> 01:30:51,340
when does it become,

1819
01:30:51,340 --> 01:30:53,020
when does it become bribe?
Okay,

1820
01:30:53,021 --> 01:30:56,260
so should she like say,
well you can never be,

1821
01:30:57,910 --> 01:30:58,780
it's weird,
right?

1822
01:30:58,810 --> 01:30:59,643
You couldn't be someone who is in public
office and go and also have like a a 

1823
01:31:04,301 --> 01:31:09,160
book reading tour where you read from 
your novel about crime or something like

1824
01:31:09,161 --> 01:31:09,994
that.
You'd have to be like a no fiction 

1825
01:31:11,591 --> 01:31:14,620
person who's we?
When you're talking,

1826
01:31:14,710 --> 01:31:16,570
you're talking about what you do for 
work.

1827
01:31:16,670 --> 01:31:18,040
That's part of what you're talking 
about.

1828
01:31:18,190 --> 01:31:20,860
Like,
nobody's going to re ask Hillary Clinton

1829
01:31:20,861 --> 01:31:23,470
to come and speak about the history of 
jazz in the United States.

1830
01:31:23,810 --> 01:31:24,643
Right.
She's not going to give speeches on 

1831
01:31:25,121 --> 01:31:27,100
that.
It's going to give speeches on politics.

1832
01:31:27,190 --> 01:31:28,450
Right,
right,

1833
01:31:28,660 --> 01:31:29,111
right.
So,

1834
01:31:29,111 --> 01:31:31,390
okay,
so why is that okay.

1835
01:31:31,540 --> 01:31:34,660
Why can you like have two jobs?
That means you're having a second job.

1836
01:31:34,690 --> 01:31:36,370
Like you're doing your job.
Like you're,

1837
01:31:36,640 --> 01:31:38,860
you're saying the things that you say 
during your job,

1838
01:31:38,861 --> 01:31:41,830
but somebody else is paying you to,
why is it okay that,

1839
01:31:41,831 --> 01:31:46,300
why is it okay to do that?
Like that seems like that's like,

1840
01:31:46,360 --> 01:31:48,060
that seems like very problematic.
Right?

1841
01:31:48,770 --> 01:31:52,220
Why is it okay for your husband to go 
talk?

1842
01:31:52,280 --> 01:31:54,170
Who has he talked to you that the head 
of the,

1843
01:31:54,410 --> 01:31:56,440
whoever the prosecutor who was it eats 
district.

1844
01:31:56,670 --> 01:31:59,770
His Bill Clinton went and had this 
secret meeting with what's his,

1845
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:02,710
who was it about what?
Well,

1846
01:32:02,720 --> 01:32:03,450
right.

1847
01:32:03,450 --> 01:32:04,261
Oh,
right,

1848
01:32:04,261 --> 01:32:04,920
right,
right.

1849
01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:07,290
Lindsey,
what the Hell is her name?

1850
01:32:10,390 --> 01:32:11,223
Lost it.

1851
01:32:11,720 --> 01:32:13,160
Damn it.
The point is like,

1852
01:32:13,161 --> 01:32:16,910
you just are openly like hiring,
hiring the,

1853
01:32:17,120 --> 01:32:21,800
the,
the woman who somehow warped the process

1854
01:32:21,801 --> 01:32:24,500
of getting a Democratic nominee there.
Yeah.

1855
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:26,120
What's her name?
Loretta.

1856
01:32:26,150 --> 01:32:26,983
Loretta Lynch.
Doesn't that sound like a country 

1857
01:32:28,851 --> 01:32:29,541
singer?
Is that?

1858
01:32:29,541 --> 01:32:29,991
Uh,
yeah.

1859
01:32:29,991 --> 01:32:31,670
That's fine.
First I was like,

1860
01:32:32,180 --> 01:32:33,080
yeah,
Loretta Lynn,

1861
01:32:33,081 --> 01:32:34,070
right.
That's what it sounds like.

1862
01:32:34,071 --> 01:32:35,230
Loretta Lynch.
Yeah.

1863
01:32:35,450 --> 01:32:36,283
Now she met Bill Clinton meets with the 
attorney general on an Arizona Tarmac 

1864
01:32:39,201 --> 01:32:39,570
now.
Right.

1865
01:32:39,570 --> 01:32:40,403
By the way,
flew in on his private plane and said 

1866
01:32:42,451 --> 01:32:43,284
that he,
it was impromptu who not fuck flat and 

1867
01:32:47,101 --> 01:32:48,470
prompt to on a private.

1868
01:32:48,570 --> 01:32:49,740
Yeah.
Yeah.

1869
01:32:50,280 --> 01:32:51,170
Hey,
you know what?

1870
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:53,940
Hey,
who are we flying over right now?

1871
01:32:54,950 --> 01:32:56,820
Wait,
are we flying over Loretta Lynch?

1872
01:32:56,850 --> 01:32:57,451
Oh,
come on,

1873
01:32:57,451 --> 01:32:59,340
stop down and we'll get a piece of apple
pie.

1874
01:32:59,910 --> 01:33:00,743
She's a good wall.
And we're going to sit on the porch and 

1875
01:33:02,341 --> 01:33:03,174
drink lemonade.
Talk about our grandchildren on the 

1876
01:33:04,561 --> 01:33:05,790
porch,
on the tarmac.

1877
01:33:05,791 --> 01:33:06,624
Nothing I love more than a nice,
a nice picnic on the tarmac of an 

1878
01:33:09,691 --> 01:33:10,524
airport.

1879
01:33:10,580 --> 01:33:15,110
This is the other thing that she lied 
about being dead broke after leaving the

1880
01:33:15,110 --> 01:33:16,670
White House.
Not only dead broke,

1881
01:33:16,671 --> 01:33:19,040
but in debt.
She said that apparently the system,

1882
01:33:19,280 --> 01:33:20,390
so not true.

1883
01:33:21,710 --> 01:33:22,543
Yeah.
And now and now it's like t tea to make 

1884
01:33:23,991 --> 01:33:27,230
matters worse.
It's like you have to,

1885
01:33:27,830 --> 01:33:30,380
there's this weird idea that it's like,
listen,

1886
01:33:31,100 --> 01:33:33,350
you might not like Hillary fucking 
Clinton.

1887
01:33:33,620 --> 01:33:35,540
Can you go back to that real quick?
But they're like,

1888
01:33:35,570 --> 01:33:36,403
you better shut the fuck up about her 
because do you want trump to be 

1889
01:33:39,891 --> 01:33:41,450
president?
That is what's going on,

1890
01:33:41,451 --> 01:33:41,941
right?
Yeah.

1891
01:33:41,941 --> 01:33:42,700
So

1892
01:33:42,700 --> 01:33:43,533
it says here,
this is what,

1893
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:45,400
this is where it's confusing.
It says,

1894
01:33:45,401 --> 01:33:46,234
when Hillary filed a financial 
disclosure document after entering the 

1895
01:33:48,851 --> 01:33:52,480
Senate in 2001 she reported assets of 
less than 1.8

1896
01:33:52,481 --> 01:33:54,670
million in liabilities are more than 2 
million.

1897
01:33:54,790 --> 01:33:55,750
Well,
where are they doing?

1898
01:33:55,780 --> 01:33:58,900
What were they doing with all the money?
What he's spending money on?

1899
01:33:59,090 --> 01:34:01,180
There's like,
who the fuck?

1900
01:34:01,330 --> 01:34:06,100
Okay,
who has like $2 million in assets and in

1901
01:34:06,160 --> 01:34:08,920
$2 million in debt?
Do you have $2 million in debt?

1902
01:34:08,950 --> 01:34:09,783
No.
Most people don't have $2 million in 

1903
01:34:11,591 --> 01:34:12,050
debt.
That's,

1904
01:34:12,050 --> 01:34:13,510
that's a crazy amount of money.
Like,

1905
01:34:13,900 --> 01:34:16,210
did you guys have a budget?
You're dead broke.

1906
01:34:16,211 --> 01:34:17,044
Now you guys are crazy liquid.
He party and you guys do a blow and 

1907
01:34:19,270 --> 01:34:22,120
buying Ferrari's.
Just staying on a Amazon later.

1908
01:34:22,900 --> 01:34:26,800
Who the fuck gets $2 million in the hole
like that.

1909
01:34:26,860 --> 01:34:27,693
That is like,
if you want to have someone that you 

1910
01:34:30,191 --> 01:34:31,024
wanted to balance the budget,
wouldn't you pick the person that 

1911
01:34:32,801 --> 01:34:35,560
doesn't get 2 million in the hole?
I mean,

1912
01:34:35,580 --> 01:34:37,240
no man,
it tried,

1913
01:34:37,900 --> 01:34:40,060
trump's been bankrupt a gang at times 
too,

1914
01:34:40,061 --> 01:34:41,300
right?
As he been bankrupt.

1915
01:34:41,570 --> 01:34:42,830
Yup.
That's what they say.

1916
01:34:42,950 --> 01:34:46,130
He says he likes going bankrupt.
It's somehow part of some plan.

1917
01:34:46,280 --> 01:34:50,780
But now the question,
what about the shit about Saudi Arabia?

1918
01:34:50,900 --> 01:34:52,580
What is this?
You don't remember this?

1919
01:34:52,581 --> 01:34:54,620
I remember when it,
it's like Saturday night live was making

1920
01:34:54,621 --> 01:34:56,660
jokes about them stealing like,
uh,

1921
01:34:57,380 --> 01:34:58,430
like silverware

1922
01:34:58,430 --> 01:34:59,263
and fine China and stuff from the,
when they were like leaving like on 

1923
01:35:01,550 --> 01:35:03,430
their last days there last,
oh,

1924
01:35:03,450 --> 01:35:06,590
that's what year was.
This was like two and from 2000,

1925
01:35:07,070 --> 01:35:09,530
like when they were literally leaving in
the bushes were coming in.

1926
01:35:09,590 --> 01:35:10,423
Oh my God.
Taking all sorts of extra artwork and 

1927
01:35:12,441 --> 01:35:14,660
all kinds of things.
And I don't know if it's true,

1928
01:35:14,661 --> 01:35:17,480
but it's,
I don't think the meme has gone away.

1929
01:35:17,580 --> 01:35:18,720
I don't know,
man.

1930
01:35:19,390 --> 01:35:21,270
Ha.
That's hilarious.

1931
01:35:21,330 --> 01:35:21,800
Oh No,
no,

1932
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:23,760
she's so gangster.
Pardon me.

1933
01:35:23,790 --> 01:35:24,810
Look,
look,

1934
01:35:25,040 --> 01:35:27,930
I,
I kind of appreciate it in a way.

1935
01:35:28,050 --> 01:35:31,680
She's like our Putin.
Great,

1936
01:35:32,580 --> 01:35:33,690
great.
Just what we need.

1937
01:35:34,290 --> 01:35:36,270
We appreciate some gangster,
she is,

1938
01:35:36,630 --> 01:35:41,130
there's a video going around of her 
talking from 2000 about not having email

1939
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:44,460
and then imagine if she had emails like 
what the investigators would find.

1940
01:35:45,180 --> 01:35:46,500
Sure.
Of course if fine.

1941
01:35:46,501 --> 01:35:48,390
It's on Mike Pence,
his twitter page.

1942
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:51,870
Didn't she take money from Saudi Arabia 
or is that bullshit?

1943
01:35:51,990 --> 01:35:54,510
Allegedly?
I'm not really her accountant so I can't

1944
01:35:54,511 --> 01:35:55,590
just,
I don't know.

1945
01:35:56,490 --> 01:35:57,301
I just,
you know,

1946
01:35:57,301 --> 01:35:58,470
man,
I think it's a,

1947
01:35:58,680 --> 01:36:03,080
it's like a crazy time right now because
we're actually getting to witness that.

1948
01:36:03,100 --> 01:36:03,933
The,
the cool thing about all this shit is 

1949
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,260
nefarious as these assholes want to be 
there.

1950
01:36:07,320 --> 01:36:10,230
There they can't keep up with 
technology.

1951
01:36:10,320 --> 01:36:11,153
They are being exposed technologically 
and that's going to continue to happen 

1952
01:36:16,770 --> 01:36:18,610
and that's pretty fucking bad ass man.
They get,

1953
01:36:18,720 --> 01:36:21,150
no matter how powerful or gangster 
Hillary Clinton is,

1954
01:36:21,330 --> 01:36:22,163
she has apparently zero security on our 
computer systems are very little 

1955
01:36:26,311 --> 01:36:28,740
security.
And maybe if she had great security,

1956
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:34,000
she still couldn't stop the infiltration
of a hackers.

1957
01:36:34,410 --> 01:36:35,243
And this is going to keep happening and 
happening and happening until either we 

1958
01:36:38,041 --> 01:36:43,041
just accept that our politicians are 
innately corrupt or we come up with some

1959
01:36:44,011 --> 01:36:48,720
fucking way to starve them out to make 
it so that they are.

1960
01:36:49,140 --> 01:36:50,040
But how,
I mean we'll,

1961
01:36:50,041 --> 01:36:51,990
do you think Bernie was like the first 
step in that?

1962
01:36:52,190 --> 01:36:54,240
Like Bernie's no perfect person,
right?

1963
01:36:54,270 --> 01:36:55,103
I'm not the most gigantic Bernie Sanders
supporter because of talk to economists 

1964
01:37:00,061 --> 01:37:03,780
that tell me that what he was proposing 
is not fiscally possible.

1965
01:37:03,810 --> 01:37:06,030
Yeah.
So I don't know if they're right or he's

1966
01:37:06,031 --> 01:37:06,420
right.

1967
01:37:06,420 --> 01:37:10,320
And it's all real tricky to me.
Like the idea of democratic socialism.

1968
01:37:10,321 --> 01:37:10,681
Like,
boy,

1969
01:37:10,681 --> 01:37:12,210
it sounds good.
It sounds good.

1970
01:37:12,211 --> 01:37:13,041
If people got more,
I'm,

1971
01:37:13,041 --> 01:37:15,810
I'm warming up to the idea of universal 
basic income.

1972
01:37:15,811 --> 01:37:16,644
I kind of liked that idea because I 
think if you think about how much 

1973
01:37:18,511 --> 01:37:19,344
resources we spend on things like cops 
and firemen and d damaged on and police 

1974
01:37:24,331 --> 01:37:25,340
and fire,
um,

1975
01:37:25,430 --> 01:37:26,263
uh,
rather prisons and how much time maybe 

1976
01:37:27,871 --> 01:37:30,420
we could avoid some of that.
Like maybe a big chunk of it.

1977
01:37:30,900 --> 01:37:33,450
I think universal basic income has like 
some real,

1978
01:37:33,870 --> 01:37:36,450
there's got some,
it's something that we should explore as

1979
01:37:36,451 --> 01:37:37,470
a culture,
but we,

1980
01:37:37,471 --> 01:37:38,304
I think also requiring people to do 
certain things like in the community 

1981
01:37:41,791 --> 01:37:44,160
requiring some sort of community 
service.

1982
01:37:44,370 --> 01:37:46,800
Like how nice would it be if a,
I mean,

1983
01:37:46,801 --> 01:37:49,170
it's nice to be able to pay someone to 
take out the garbage,

1984
01:37:49,171 --> 01:37:52,770
but maybe we'd appreciate each other 
more if we all took out the garbage once

1985
01:37:52,771 --> 01:37:53,461
a month.
No Way,

1986
01:37:53,461 --> 01:37:54,690
man.
I disagree with that.

1987
01:37:54,691 --> 01:37:56,040
That's what they're in Venezuela

1988
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:57,080
by the way.
They're doing,

1989
01:37:57,280 --> 01:37:58,113
they're forcing people to be civil,
to be farmers for like 60 days out of 

1990
01:38:03,571 --> 01:38:04,830
the year.
Something like that.

1991
01:38:04,831 --> 01:38:07,160
But I make them feel good about farmers 
know,

1992
01:38:07,170 --> 01:38:10,980
cause like Venezuela's fucking imploding
and they need like Dan but,

1993
01:38:11,010 --> 01:38:12,810
but um,
I'll tell you man,

1994
01:38:13,470 --> 01:38:14,303
any time the government or federal 
workers get more power in whatever way 

1995
01:38:20,671 --> 01:38:24,240
it may be,
that's a bad thing for all of us.

1996
01:38:24,570 --> 01:38:26,130
And I think that the,
the,

1997
01:38:26,220 --> 01:38:27,053
the,
the more we can push their fucking 

1998
01:38:29,851 --> 01:38:33,780
tendrils out of our consciousness the 
better.

1999
01:38:34,020 --> 01:38:38,670
And so anytime anyone is suggesting some
new,

2000
01:38:38,671 --> 01:38:41,070
I don't care how fucking utopian it 
sounds.

2001
01:38:41,250 --> 01:38:43,050
Anytime anyone.
Here's the thing.

2002
01:38:43,230 --> 01:38:46,680
Do you think the government is corrupt?
If the answer is yes,

2003
01:38:46,920 --> 01:38:49,620
why would you want to give them more 
power?

2004
01:38:49,680 --> 01:38:51,000
What would you want to give them more 
tax planning.

2005
01:38:51,030 --> 01:38:51,930
Yeah.
Yes.

2006
01:38:51,931 --> 01:38:52,350
Why?

2007
01:38:52,350 --> 01:38:53,183
There's no,
now when you're talking about taxing 

2008
01:38:54,931 --> 01:38:55,764
people,
you're not talking about giving them 

2009
01:38:56,371 --> 01:38:58,470
money directly to the poor people,
right?

2010
01:38:58,500 --> 01:38:59,550
You know?
Yeah,

2011
01:38:59,551 --> 01:39:00,384
man.
Talking about going to the government 

2012
01:39:01,020 --> 01:39:03,150
and the government distributes it with 
no receipt.

2013
01:39:03,510 --> 01:39:04,290
Right?
Man,

2014
01:39:04,290 --> 01:39:05,420
that's what they do right now.
Yeah.

2015
01:39:05,430 --> 01:39:07,110
We don't want that.
That's fucked up.

2016
01:39:07,140 --> 01:39:09,780
If these people up there,
if they were like,

2017
01:39:09,990 --> 01:39:13,890
somehow we actually just imagine,
here's a crazy fantasy.

2018
01:39:14,040 --> 01:39:14,873
I don't know how you'd implement it,
but let's imagine we had a system where 

2019
01:39:17,610 --> 01:39:20,430
every four years,
some of the coolest,

2020
01:39:20,460 --> 01:39:24,030
smartest people in the country became 
our leaders.

2021
01:39:24,360 --> 01:39:27,480
Wow.
That would be fucking insane.

2022
01:39:27,490 --> 01:39:29,280
Coolest,
smartest people don't want that job just

2023
01:39:29,281 --> 01:39:31,350
by nature.
So it's a strange job.

2024
01:39:31,530 --> 01:39:34,050
The idea of wanting to be the person 
that's in control of everything,

2025
01:39:34,051 --> 01:39:37,740
and I think until it goes horribly 
wrong,

2026
01:39:38,340 --> 01:39:41,340
we're going to stay on the outside and 
we're going to go hug somebody.

2027
01:39:41,370 --> 01:39:42,960
Come on somebody,
come on somebody.

2028
01:39:43,020 --> 01:39:43,801
I'll tell you,
man,

2029
01:39:43,801 --> 01:39:47,160
I think some of the coolest,
smartest people because they're so cool.

2030
01:39:47,430 --> 01:39:49,470
If I'm just saying,
this is a mystery,

2031
01:39:49,471 --> 01:39:51,750
how to get to them,
but let's just say you could.

2032
01:39:51,960 --> 01:39:53,310
That's a mystery.
How you get to them,

2033
01:39:53,311 --> 01:39:55,920
let's say,
and let's imagine there was what?

2034
01:39:55,950 --> 01:39:56,783
Who are they?
You don't even know the name of a 

2035
01:39:58,960 --> 01:39:59,793
person,
but gave me the attributes you would 

2036
01:40:00,811 --> 01:40:03,870
want to.
I would take somebody like Elon Musk.

2037
01:40:04,290 --> 01:40:07,650
I would take somebody like you.
I would take somebody.

2038
01:40:07,680 --> 01:40:09,420
Why not?
I would take somebody like,

2039
01:40:09,421 --> 01:40:10,530
I'm so,
I don't want the job.

2040
01:40:10,620 --> 01:40:12,360
What?
I don't want to judge you on.

2041
01:40:12,410 --> 01:40:13,171
Doesn't either.
All right,

2042
01:40:13,171 --> 01:40:14,004
fine,
but we all sit together in a room and 

2043
01:40:15,811 --> 01:40:17,160
we're like,
hey man,

2044
01:40:17,670 --> 01:40:21,360
let's imagine like five more fat acids,
right?

2045
01:40:21,480 --> 01:40:23,910
We all sit together in a room and we 
say,

2046
01:40:23,970 --> 01:40:24,803
listen,
I know none of you guys wanted this 

2047
01:40:26,461 --> 01:40:27,294
fucking job.

2048
01:40:27,480 --> 01:40:28,313
You're successful because you're super 
smart and you're super cool and you're 

2049
01:40:32,341 --> 01:40:33,174
having great lives,
but would you consider for a couple of 

2050
01:40:37,410 --> 01:40:38,243
years helping us work this shit out so 
the planet gets a little better and I 

2051
01:40:42,571 --> 01:40:43,710
guaranteed.
Now again,

2052
01:40:43,711 --> 01:40:44,544
this is a fantasy,
but I guarantee that there'll be very 

2053
01:40:46,921 --> 01:40:48,240
few people in that room.
You'd be like,

2054
01:40:48,241 --> 01:40:50,250
no,
I'm going to live my life.

2055
01:40:50,370 --> 01:40:51,060
You'd be like,
yeah,

2056
01:40:51,060 --> 01:40:52,500
I'll do it for two years.
No problem.

2057
01:40:52,680 --> 01:40:54,340
How do for four years?
Sure.

2058
01:40:54,580 --> 01:40:55,413
I would love to help and still for four 
years you go into this job truly 

2059
01:40:59,860 --> 01:41:00,940
thinking,
man,

2060
01:41:00,970 --> 01:41:01,803
I'm going to see if I can reduce the 
number of people who are fucking 

2061
01:41:05,170 --> 01:41:06,003
uneducated and hungry and the bombs 
going off and I'm going to try to do it 

2062
01:41:10,480 --> 01:41:11,313
by using all of my smartest friends and 
I'm not doing it because I'm going to 

2063
01:41:14,531 --> 01:41:16,420
get money from this group or that group.

2064
01:41:16,630 --> 01:41:19,180
I'm doing it because it feels like the 
right thing to do.

2065
01:41:19,360 --> 01:41:20,620
Do you know what that's called,
man?

2066
01:41:21,010 --> 01:41:25,450
That's called the American fucking dream
that the founding fathers came up with.

2067
01:41:25,630 --> 01:41:26,463
That was the idea.
We're going to have a group of 

2068
01:41:28,660 --> 01:41:29,493
brilliant,
wonderful people who want this 

2069
01:41:32,561 --> 01:41:36,790
particular swath of human beings to be 
peaceful.

2070
01:41:36,850 --> 01:41:37,683
What is it?
A peaceful place where you can 

2071
01:41:38,951 --> 01:41:42,160
experience life,
liberty,

2072
01:41:42,340 --> 01:41:45,340
and the pursuit of happiness,
right?

2073
01:41:45,490 --> 01:41:46,930
Freedom,
autonomy,

2074
01:41:47,260 --> 01:41:49,480
community,
all of these beautiful things.

2075
01:41:49,481 --> 01:41:51,490
That was the idea,
beautiful idea.

2076
01:41:51,570 --> 01:41:55,630
It will almost make you cry when you 
think about how beautiful a fucking idea

2077
01:41:55,631 --> 01:41:56,464
that is.
And then to imagine that that idea over 

2078
01:41:59,501 --> 01:42:03,190
the course of time was gradually 
deteriorated,

2079
01:42:03,400 --> 01:42:07,330
gradually infiltrated,
gradually broken down.

2080
01:42:07,510 --> 01:42:11,950
And of course it was because when there 
is a powerful empire,

2081
01:42:12,340 --> 01:42:16,780
the empire is inevitably attacked by 
entities that want to take it over.

2082
01:42:16,900 --> 01:42:19,060
Of course,
it's the nature of things.

2083
01:42:19,150 --> 01:42:22,450
Something powerful,
some asshole wants that power.

2084
01:42:22,660 --> 01:42:23,493
And so an analysis of the system over 
the course of time or in an intentional 

2085
01:42:28,810 --> 01:42:33,810
infiltration by people who have all the 
money or just some systemic degradation,

2086
01:42:35,740 --> 01:42:36,573
a slow sort of collapse of a million 
different systems inside the thing has 

2087
01:42:41,321 --> 01:42:42,154
happened that has happened and yet the 
concept remains one of the most 

2088
01:42:46,421 --> 01:42:47,254
beautiful ideas,
one of the most incredible fucking 

2089
01:42:49,271 --> 01:42:51,520
ideas.
They cannot erode the concept.

2090
01:42:51,790 --> 01:42:53,860
Well maybe it can still be saved with 
technology.

2091
01:42:54,340 --> 01:42:55,173
Maybe the transparency that's being 
afforded by technology is going to 

2092
01:42:57,310 --> 01:42:58,143
somehow or another step in and put a 
halt to what we see as just a standard 

2093
01:43:04,360 --> 01:43:07,750
operational behavior of corruption and 
influence,

2094
01:43:07,810 --> 01:43:08,643
corruption and influences.
Just so standard that it's right in 

2095
01:43:10,991 --> 01:43:11,824
front of us.
When CNN is printing Hillary Clinton's 

2096
01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:19,390
annual earnings for the past two years 
is $21 million and no one's baton and I,

2097
01:43:19,960 --> 01:43:23,230
she's sitting there with a bite suit.
She has that bite suit on,

2098
01:43:23,270 --> 01:43:25,720
looks like a fucking German shepherds 
going to jump out of the bushes and grab

2099
01:43:25,721 --> 01:43:26,554
her suit.
She walks around these boxy bite suit 

2100
01:43:29,380 --> 01:43:30,213
and she's,
she's making ungodly sums of money from 

2101
01:43:33,761 --> 01:43:35,260
just talking and she's doing it,
doing it,

2102
01:43:35,560 --> 01:43:37,160
doing it right in front of our face.
Yeah,

2103
01:43:37,270 --> 01:43:38,103
it's,
I mean that's one of the beautiful 

2104
01:43:38,981 --> 01:43:39,814
things about Bernie Sanders,
one of the most beautiful things he 

2105
01:43:41,621 --> 01:43:43,690
says,
I didn't take a dime from those people.

2106
01:43:43,690 --> 01:43:46,420
I don't speak to the banks because what 
did you,

2107
01:43:46,450 --> 01:43:47,283
what did you say when you got paid?
Half a million plus or whatever she got 

2108
01:43:50,591 --> 01:43:51,424
paid to speak.
How much did she get paid to speak to 

2109
01:43:52,581 --> 01:43:53,414
the banks?
Because there was something fucking 

2110
01:43:54,801 --> 01:43:55,634
bananas about that one.
There was one of the ones that she got 

2111
01:43:57,591 --> 01:43:58,251
paid.
I made,

2112
01:43:58,251 --> 01:44:00,590
it might've been the 250 million now 
release.

2113
01:44:01,100 --> 01:44:02,360
Yeah,
there's a bunch you want release.

2114
01:44:02,390 --> 01:44:04,160
She won't release the ones who she talks
to banks,

2115
01:44:04,220 --> 01:44:05,900
they'll get released,
they speak in Latin,

2116
01:44:05,930 --> 01:44:07,940
they get together.
They fucking burn baby snakes.

2117
01:44:07,941 --> 01:44:11,830
My lyrics virologically I started 
talking in tongues and ship summary.

2118
01:44:12,110 --> 01:44:14,990
[inaudible] they're all eyes wide.
Shut it out.

2119
01:44:15,260 --> 01:44:16,093
Yeah.
Hoods on and fucking candle light 

2120
01:44:17,990 --> 01:44:19,460
pentagrams everywhere.
Yeah,

2121
01:44:19,461 --> 01:44:20,151
man,
you,

2122
01:44:20,151 --> 01:44:20,984
they pro I wouldn't be fucking surprised
if there's a few things they do that we 

2123
01:44:23,601 --> 01:44:26,810
might consider to be a little abnormal 
when they get together.

2124
01:44:26,900 --> 01:44:28,370
Bohemian Grove,
look,

2125
01:44:28,371 --> 01:44:30,410
Bohemian Grove,
whatever the fuck they're doing,

2126
01:44:30,411 --> 01:44:35,270
their whatever they they do it for,
for whatever reason they really do.

2127
01:44:35,300 --> 01:44:39,770
Or at least used to dress up in robes 
and burn an effigy in front of a fucking

2128
01:44:39,771 --> 01:44:41,540
giant owl statue.
Okay.

2129
01:44:41,750 --> 01:44:44,150
There's a video of it.
It's real for them.

2130
01:44:44,151 --> 01:44:46,820
They say it's fun and it's just like a,
uh,

2131
01:44:47,300 --> 01:44:52,010
one of those frat pranks or traditions 
that people do,

2132
01:44:52,160 --> 01:44:52,993
although dress up in weird costumes and 
they go through some weird skull and 

2133
01:44:55,851 --> 01:44:59,660
bones ceremony that their grand pappy 
did and everybody does it.

2134
01:44:59,661 --> 01:45:01,670
Cause you want to be,
what does that,

2135
01:45:01,720 --> 01:45:02,720
what is it called?
Pledged.

2136
01:45:02,750 --> 01:45:04,060
You want to be pledged?
Initiated.

2137
01:45:04,120 --> 01:45:05,050
Initiated.
Yeah.

2138
01:45:05,060 --> 01:45:06,140
I mean,
come on man.

2139
01:45:06,440 --> 01:45:07,273
This is,
there's a real video of these fucking 

2140
01:45:08,961 --> 01:45:13,620
multimillionaire guys meeting in 
Bohemian Grove and burning these fit.

2141
01:45:13,670 --> 01:45:15,980
Look at that.
Hillary Clinton was paid $225,000

2142
01:45:15,981 --> 01:45:18,860
to speak at Goldman Sachs builders and 
innovators,

2143
01:45:18,861 --> 01:45:19,694
conference builders and innovative at 
the Ritz Carlton Dove Mountain Resort 

2144
01:45:24,381 --> 01:45:25,850
and Marina,
Arizona.

2145
01:45:25,850 --> 01:45:26,683
That is a Golfer's paradise.
All those rich dudes out there golfing 

2146
01:45:30,050 --> 01:45:30,883
drive in those convertible Mercedes is 
with the metal tops close and open and 

2147
01:45:34,251 --> 01:45:35,930
like 13 seconds.
Yeah.

2148
01:45:35,931 --> 01:45:36,970
These,
these guys are,

2149
01:45:37,010 --> 01:45:38,360
look,
they're all fucking monsters.

2150
01:45:38,540 --> 01:45:39,373
You know,
man,

2151
01:45:39,380 --> 01:45:41,150
I,
I'll tell you,

2152
01:45:41,180 --> 01:45:43,700
this is something that I was thinking,
and by the way,

2153
01:45:44,300 --> 01:45:45,133
I'm sorry,
I did a fucking seemingly patriotic 

2154
01:45:47,091 --> 01:45:48,820
spiel.
I didn't know that was inside of it.

2155
01:45:48,990 --> 01:45:49,850
It's,
well,

2156
01:45:49,851 --> 01:45:51,020
it is patriotic,
but it's,

2157
01:45:51,021 --> 01:45:52,970
it's you.
You are right.

2158
01:45:53,720 --> 01:45:56,840
These people were massively repressed by
Europe.

2159
01:45:57,260 --> 01:45:58,093
They took this incredible chance of 
getting in boats and coming across an 

2160
01:46:01,280 --> 01:46:02,113
ocean in the time where we're navigating
things with something that looks like a 

2161
01:46:05,660 --> 01:46:07,650
protractor.
I mean the,

2162
01:46:07,690 --> 01:46:10,310
the,
he had sextants and other staring at the

2163
01:46:10,311 --> 01:46:12,770
fucking constellations trying to figure 
out which way to go.

2164
01:46:12,890 --> 01:46:14,780
They're manipulating the air and get 
there.

2165
01:46:14,810 --> 01:46:17,810
It's fucking amazing.
And a lot of them are doing that because

2166
01:46:17,811 --> 01:46:18,644
they want to worship God in a certain 
way that they're not able to show you 

2167
01:46:21,051 --> 01:46:21,884
where they're coming from.
But even even whatever their rationale 

2168
01:46:24,381 --> 01:46:25,214
for leaving,
they still had the balls to get on a 

2169
01:46:26,181 --> 01:46:27,014
fucking boat and make cross the ocean.
So that puts them in a better place in 

2170
01:46:29,841 --> 01:46:30,674
my eyes.
Then those pussies that stayed back and 

2171
01:46:32,541 --> 01:46:35,180
believed in logic but lived under the 
rule of the queen.

2172
01:46:35,220 --> 01:46:37,160
Yeah,
those dummies are the king.

2173
01:46:37,200 --> 01:46:39,770
Was it came back then?
Probably probably a kings.

2174
01:46:40,190 --> 01:46:42,890
But my point is I don't have a point,
but if I had a point,

2175
01:46:43,040 --> 01:46:43,873
what would it would be?
That's the reason why America is so 

2176
01:46:46,221 --> 01:46:49,010
fucking bad ass that at least at least 
the

2177
01:46:50,130 --> 01:46:53,310
of the initial instincts to start it 
still exist.

2178
01:46:53,340 --> 01:46:54,900
Yeah.
The idea can't go away.

2179
01:46:54,901 --> 01:46:56,350
It's a,
it's like a geometric form.

2180
01:46:56,351 --> 01:46:57,540
It,
here's the problem man.

2181
01:46:57,660 --> 01:46:59,040
Okay,
this is why it's thinking.

2182
01:46:59,220 --> 01:47:03,270
So let's imagine that you and I are 
somehow,

2183
01:47:03,271 --> 01:47:04,104
I don't know why we end up on a cruise 
ship filled with idiots like literal 

2184
01:47:08,851 --> 01:47:11,640
fucking idiots fricking happen.
Somehow they just like,

2185
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:15,510
they went through like maybe like some,
it's like the opposite of a reality show

2186
01:47:15,720 --> 01:47:19,650
where you find a great person like over 
the course of like months,

2187
01:47:19,651 --> 01:47:22,770
they find like the world's worst people,
right?

2188
01:47:23,040 --> 01:47:23,873
And so are the world's like maybe like 
the world's most unwise people are the 

2189
01:47:27,391 --> 01:47:28,224
world's dumbest people.
So you end up in with like a population 

2190
01:47:31,081 --> 01:47:35,220
of like 60 idiots on the boat.
And I'm not saying we're not idiots.

2191
01:47:35,310 --> 01:47:38,430
I certainly don't consider myself to be 
a MENSA member,

2192
01:47:38,580 --> 01:47:39,413
but,
but let's imagine we're a little like 

2193
01:47:41,040 --> 01:47:42,990
more on the ball and these guys are 
right,

2194
01:47:43,290 --> 01:47:46,110
the boat fucking racks.

2195
01:47:46,200 --> 01:47:48,810
We're on an island now we have to build 
a civilization.

2196
01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:50,273
How does democracy become a good thing 
if the majority of people are kind of 

2197
01:47:56,070 --> 01:47:58,860
not that fucking on point,
right?

2198
01:47:59,040 --> 01:48:00,060
What happens if,
um,

2199
01:48:00,120 --> 01:48:00,953
what if it's a,
let's imagine it's a boat filled with 

2200
01:48:02,401 --> 01:48:03,234
psychotics.
Let's imagine it's a boat filled with 

2201
01:48:04,831 --> 01:48:07,650
people who are paranoid schizophrenia 
for example.

2202
01:48:07,830 --> 01:48:11,250
How do you have a democracy of paranoid 
schizophrenia,

2203
01:48:11,260 --> 01:48:12,093
six running things.
And so when you have the news spraying 

2204
01:48:15,451 --> 01:48:16,284
out a paradigm that is also weirdly 
corrupt in the sense that the news is 

2205
01:48:21,301 --> 01:48:22,134
being run by a groups of people who want
to sell advertising and need to be 

2206
01:48:26,101 --> 01:48:27,420
entertaining.
And you know,

2207
01:48:27,421 --> 01:48:30,900
they have to at least present this 
information and it kind of entertaining,

2208
01:48:31,140 --> 01:48:31,973
possibly warped way.
There are cases including in the recent 

2209
01:48:35,670 --> 01:48:36,503
wikileaks,
uh,

2210
01:48:36,630 --> 01:48:38,460
dump that,
where the,

2211
01:48:38,880 --> 01:48:39,710
uh,
where they were the,

2212
01:48:39,710 --> 01:48:40,890
in the,
what's it called,

2213
01:48:40,891 --> 01:48:43,920
the ndd that in the nondisclosure 
agreement with the national,

2214
01:48:43,921 --> 01:48:46,470
the Democratic Group,
the DNC,

2215
01:48:46,471 --> 01:48:50,520
the DNC was telling,
giving like talking points to the press,

2216
01:48:50,570 --> 01:48:51,180
right?

2217
01:48:51,180 --> 01:48:52,013
So if the media is painting a picture of
the universe that is not accurate or is 

2218
01:48:58,881 --> 01:48:59,714
warped a little bit based on consumerism
or the corporations that are running 

2219
01:49:04,171 --> 01:49:06,690
things,
then the people who have tuned into that

2220
01:49:06,691 --> 01:49:07,524
reality and believe it to be true,
you could safely say they are mildly 

2221
01:49:11,101 --> 01:49:16,101
psychotic because they have bought into 
a reality tunnel that might not actually

2222
01:49:16,291 --> 01:49:17,124
exist.
In which case is a democracy at that 

2223
01:49:19,441 --> 01:49:20,460
point.
A good thing.

2224
01:49:20,640 --> 01:49:24,030
If the people living in the democracy 
have for a lifetime,

2225
01:49:24,240 --> 01:49:28,380
been getting bad information,
shot into their fucking brains,

2226
01:49:28,530 --> 01:49:31,980
marijuana,
I'll give you brain damage wars.

2227
01:49:31,981 --> 01:49:32,814
Good.
Sometimes you just need to fucking kill 

2228
01:49:33,991 --> 01:49:34,824
people.
We have got to get into fucking Iraq 

2229
01:49:36,990 --> 01:49:37,823
because Saddam Hussein has weapons of 
mass destruction that he is going to UN 

2230
01:49:42,690 --> 01:49:46,050
leash on the fucking West.
Wrong information.

2231
01:49:46,170 --> 01:49:48,820
But if you believe it,
you believe wrong information,

2232
01:49:49,030 --> 01:49:49,863
and if you believe wrong information,
then that means that you are no longer 

2233
01:49:53,680 --> 01:49:58,680
walking along the path that is there,
but a path created by other people.

2234
01:49:58,870 --> 01:49:59,703
Right?
So that's when democracy gets really 

2235
01:50:01,811 --> 01:50:06,811
interesting because now what we have is 
very powerful hypnotic cobbles of con,

2236
01:50:07,870 --> 01:50:08,471
of,
of,

2237
01:50:08,471 --> 01:50:09,304
of billionaires sending bad information 
to the population and attempt to shift 

2238
01:50:14,051 --> 01:50:14,884
their perceptual mechanisms in such a 
way that they will elect leaders that 

2239
01:50:19,991 --> 01:50:20,824
don't represent them,
but that have been created by these 

2240
01:50:23,321 --> 01:50:28,270
machines to take over the world.
And in that case,

2241
01:50:28,510 --> 01:50:31,600
the democracy becomes a little bit more 
problematic.

2242
01:50:31,780 --> 01:50:33,460
So that's another problem.
It's like,

2243
01:50:33,461 --> 01:50:34,031
okay,
great.

2244
01:50:34,031 --> 01:50:36,640
Now let's imagine we suddenly have a 
functioning democracy.

2245
01:50:36,850 --> 01:50:41,230
What if a lot of people in that function
functioning democracy have subscribed to

2246
01:50:41,231 --> 01:50:43,210
ideas that don't,
that aren't real,

2247
01:50:43,390 --> 01:50:45,970
and that they're not willing to let go 
of?

2248
01:50:46,460 --> 01:50:47,740
Are you writing down?
Never put,

2249
01:50:47,741 --> 01:50:49,870
Duncan is showing you.
You'll know how to remember something.

2250
01:50:49,871 --> 01:50:51,230
I keep forgetting and I have to remember
it.

2251
01:50:51,550 --> 01:50:53,290
You just,
I don't want to stop your rant.

2252
01:50:53,320 --> 01:50:54,153
Oh,
cool.

2253
01:50:56,200 --> 01:50:57,033
Just,
you know when you're high as fuck like 

2254
01:50:57,641 --> 01:51:00,940
we are right now so great and we start 
talking about stuff.

2255
01:51:01,040 --> 01:51:03,110
When you're talking,
I have an idea but it just,

2256
01:51:03,111 --> 01:51:05,420
I have to follow your idea and my idea 
slips away.

2257
01:51:05,600 --> 01:51:06,433
I had to write it down.

2258
01:51:06,730 --> 01:51:07,563
It's just that the idea is what if this,
what if not many of us like the shit we 

2259
01:51:10,901 --> 01:51:11,734
believe ain't real and what if that shit
that we think is real has been 

2260
01:51:14,921 --> 01:51:15,754
intentionally placed into our heads by 
corporations with the intention of 

2261
01:51:18,641 --> 01:51:19,474
making us behave in a certain way.
At that point a democracy becomes 

2262
01:51:23,410 --> 01:51:24,243
problematic.
Like what are you going to do if you 

2263
01:51:26,080 --> 01:51:26,913
mean there's so many people right now 
who believe the like trump is putting 

2264
01:51:29,711 --> 01:51:30,544
out a reality tunnel.
Hillary Clinton's putting out a reality 

2265
01:51:32,831 --> 01:51:33,664
tunnel.
These are two different reality tunnels 

2266
01:51:35,830 --> 01:51:40,830
where many of the pieces of it might not
actually reflect what's happening in the

2267
01:51:41,021 --> 01:51:42,370
world.
So it's like,

2268
01:51:42,550 --> 01:51:43,383
which of these made up stories are you 
going to tune into or are you going to 

2269
01:51:46,481 --> 01:51:51,481
reject both of them and go wandering off
into the woods alone and try to,

2270
01:51:51,790 --> 01:51:52,623
in your own way,
understand what's happening minus the 

2271
01:51:55,240 --> 01:51:57,430
influence of the corporate media.

2272
01:51:59,460 --> 01:52:03,180
I was thinking when we're talking about 
people coming over in boats that we were

2273
01:52:03,181 --> 01:52:06,160
talking earlier about the human biome 
and uh,

2274
01:52:06,161 --> 01:52:07,830
your,
your gut biome in particular,

2275
01:52:07,831 --> 01:52:10,470
it affects your mood,
your intelligence level,

2276
01:52:10,471 --> 01:52:13,110
your personality,
it affects your immune system.

2277
01:52:13,530 --> 01:52:14,363
And that is,
that's one thing that I've been really 

2278
01:52:16,351 --> 01:52:17,184
getting into over the last few years is 
really concentrating on probiotics 

2279
01:52:20,190 --> 01:52:21,180
first.
Kombucha,

2280
01:52:21,181 --> 01:52:22,890
that was the big one.
I liked that.

2281
01:52:22,891 --> 01:52:25,290
A gts Kombucha.
I like that original flavor.

2282
01:52:25,291 --> 01:52:26,700
It's like a,
it's almost like,

2283
01:52:26,701 --> 01:52:28,200
it feels like someone blew their nose in
it.

2284
01:52:28,500 --> 01:52:31,770
Those slimy slugs,
those,

2285
01:52:31,830 --> 01:52:32,670
those,
uh,

2286
01:52:32,820 --> 01:52:34,350
Combu just slugs.
You gotta throw it down,

2287
01:52:34,351 --> 01:52:35,730
but it's really good for your immune 
system.

2288
01:52:35,731 --> 01:52:37,770
And it made a big difference with all my
travel on the road.

2289
01:52:38,010 --> 01:52:39,930
But then I started really getting into,
Kiefer,

2290
01:52:40,320 --> 01:52:43,800
started really getting into a,
I drink goat's milk keifer several times

2291
01:52:43,801 --> 01:52:46,700
a week and I drink whole glass of it and
man,

2292
01:52:46,760 --> 01:52:47,630
it,
I,

2293
01:52:47,631 --> 01:52:50,060
the more I have been constantly on that 
Kimchi.

2294
01:52:50,090 --> 01:52:51,800
That's another one that I've really 
gotten into lately.

2295
01:52:52,060 --> 01:52:53,540
Um,
fermented cabbage.

2296
01:52:53,850 --> 01:52:54,890
Um,
it's a,

2297
01:52:54,900 --> 01:52:57,050
it's really good for you,
very probiotic as well.

2298
01:52:57,090 --> 01:53:00,110
The more I'm doing this,
like I feel happier,

2299
01:53:00,500 --> 01:53:03,050
if that makes any sense.
It actually makes me feel better.

2300
01:53:03,110 --> 01:53:03,943
Yeah.
I don't just feel like healthier in 

2301
01:53:05,751 --> 01:53:08,840
terms of my immune system's really good,
but I feel better.

2302
01:53:09,470 --> 01:53:10,303
So what I was thinking is these poor 
folks that got on that boat and came 

2303
01:53:13,491 --> 01:53:14,324
across the seas.
When you think about the horrible 

2304
01:53:16,251 --> 01:53:20,080
atrocities committed by the pilgrims or 
the Columbus,

2305
01:53:20,081 --> 01:53:20,980
his soldiers,
yes.

2306
01:53:21,200 --> 01:53:22,370
When they came over here,
I mean,

2307
01:53:22,430 --> 01:53:27,430
they buy one account of a missionary.
They were dashing babies' heads on rocks

2308
01:53:27,611 --> 01:53:28,444
and were cutting people's arms off.
They didn't bring back their weight in 

2309
01:53:30,231 --> 01:53:31,064
gold.
Right.

2310
01:53:31,070 --> 01:53:33,710
There was some really dark,
dark,

2311
01:53:33,890 --> 01:53:34,723
dark shit going on.
I wonder if it was a combination of 

2312
01:53:39,950 --> 01:53:44,750
obviously barbaric human beings in 
barbaric times when things were just way

2313
01:53:44,751 --> 01:53:48,140
fucking different and it was very little
accountability for psychopathic behavior

2314
01:53:48,410 --> 01:53:50,570
and in fact you hired these fucking 
psychopaths,

2315
01:53:50,780 --> 01:53:52,760
these abused people,
murders.

2316
01:53:52,910 --> 01:53:53,743
There's,
there's are your soldiers cause your 

2317
01:53:54,440 --> 01:53:55,273
people,
you're hiring,

2318
01:53:55,460 --> 01:53:56,293
you know,
those are the people that you put on 

2319
01:53:56,691 --> 01:53:57,524
that fucking boat.
Those are the only people that are 

2320
01:53:58,071 --> 01:54:01,340
willing so they get across his ocean.
It takes months.

2321
01:54:01,341 --> 01:54:02,210
Right.
How long did it take?

2322
01:54:02,211 --> 01:54:03,260
Get across seat,
find that out.

2323
01:54:03,650 --> 01:54:05,990
I'm going to say three months.
Do you think it took three months?

2324
01:54:06,020 --> 01:54:08,210
I don't know.
I'm going to say it took like 90 days.

2325
01:54:08,240 --> 01:54:09,700
I would think longer than that.
Really,

2326
01:54:09,710 --> 01:54:11,000
man.
Probably right.

2327
01:54:11,510 --> 01:54:13,010
Maybe four months.
What do you think?

2328
01:54:13,011 --> 01:54:14,840
Four months?
I don't know.

2329
01:54:14,841 --> 01:54:18,410
Like I feel like three months to do it.
If you knew what you were doing,

2330
01:54:18,530 --> 01:54:20,780
you got to get the right wins.
I mean it's like,

2331
01:54:21,010 --> 01:54:21,843
well you definitely might not make it.
And I like it says approximately two 

2332
01:54:25,301 --> 01:54:26,850
months,
two months quick.

2333
01:54:26,880 --> 01:54:30,160
It started in early August and got there
October 12th wow.

2334
01:54:30,790 --> 01:54:31,960
God.
That's so ballsy.

2335
01:54:32,590 --> 01:54:33,423
Took approximately two months.
Christopher Columbus started his voyage 

2336
01:54:35,741 --> 01:54:40,741
in Palos Spain in early August of 1492 
with three ships,

2337
01:54:41,051 --> 01:54:41,890
the Nina,
the Pinta,

2338
01:54:41,891 --> 01:54:43,090
Santa Maria.
We all know that stuff.

2339
01:54:43,450 --> 01:54:44,830
Wow.
That's amazing.

2340
01:54:45,230 --> 01:54:46,063
Q madge and just being on that boat,
being a fucking fly on the wall on that 

2341
01:54:48,971 --> 01:54:51,940
boat,
watching those murderers sail across the

2342
01:54:51,941 --> 01:54:54,920
ocean and knowing one day you're going 
to get a day off school for those cunts.

2343
01:54:55,830 --> 01:54:57,190
No Shit.
We think of that.

2344
01:54:57,340 --> 01:54:58,173
There's these showed up,
but they just raped and murdered 

2345
01:54:59,231 --> 01:55:01,150
everybody.
We get a day off school for him.

2346
01:55:01,280 --> 01:55:02,330
Pray,
pray,

2347
01:55:02,440 --> 01:55:03,940
praying along the way.

2348
01:55:04,060 --> 01:55:06,550
Long weekend,
we're going to have a suit coming.

2349
01:55:06,730 --> 01:55:08,140
Whoo.

2350
01:55:08,490 --> 01:55:09,380
Again.
There you go.

2351
01:55:09,410 --> 01:55:10,243
Yeah.
The fucking information that we have 

2352
01:55:12,500 --> 01:55:15,980
does not accurately reflect reality.
Right.

2353
01:55:16,040 --> 01:55:16,873
We have been conditioned intentionally 
by a power structure to believe in a 

2354
01:55:22,281 --> 01:55:26,000
reality tunnel that if you don't believe
in that reality tunnel,

2355
01:55:26,180 --> 01:55:29,750
you're considered to be somebody who's a
little crazy.

2356
01:55:29,820 --> 01:55:30,900
Yeah,
your fucking mind.

2357
01:55:31,670 --> 01:55:33,760
Columbus was a good man.
What are you fucking talking about?

2358
01:55:33,890 --> 01:55:34,723
I remember that commercial where the 
guy's eating salad and his friends 

2359
01:55:36,671 --> 01:55:37,890
going,
what do you mean if I buy drugs?

2360
01:55:37,891 --> 01:55:38,470
You sports.
How?

2361
01:55:38,470 --> 01:55:39,310
Terrorism,
right.

2362
01:55:39,340 --> 01:55:41,620
Fact,
right that he's eating salad.

2363
01:55:41,621 --> 01:55:43,800
He's a no nonsense kind of steak bar.
Remember that?

2364
01:55:43,980 --> 01:55:46,620
Because it's a fact.
I say it because of the fact that's it.

2365
01:55:46,621 --> 01:55:47,454
The Guy Guy's like standing there like 
it's that relationship that we all know 

2366
01:55:49,621 --> 01:55:54,621
of that one fucking super good arguing,
right wing guy that's a little bit older

2367
01:55:55,070 --> 01:55:57,780
and the other guy and he kind of clowns 
them when they have lunch together.

2368
01:55:57,840 --> 01:55:59,190
Come on,
get your shit together Mike.

2369
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:00,353
Okay,
we're going to make the loan go through 

2370
01:56:01,471 --> 01:56:02,304
but straighten out your credit.
That's the same guy because you're 

2371
01:56:05,011 --> 01:56:08,710
supporting terrorism is the fact is 
eating a salad or say cause it's fact.

2372
01:56:08,720 --> 01:56:12,720
Yet there's something cycle.
Just like a mind fuck going on.

2373
01:56:12,720 --> 01:56:13,553
Cause we know that relationship.
We know that paradigm which wean the 

2374
01:56:16,440 --> 01:56:20,340
really fucking straight up Republican,
no nonsense.

2375
01:56:20,341 --> 01:56:23,370
Got His shit together,
has a cigar and a single malt scotch.

2376
01:56:23,371 --> 01:56:24,204
And that's about it.
And we know and that other guy who's 

2377
01:56:26,071 --> 01:56:26,461
like,
Hey,

2378
01:56:26,461 --> 01:56:29,490
I heard that tower seven is a,
is an inside job.

2379
01:56:29,520 --> 01:56:31,440
What?
Yeah,

2380
01:56:31,830 --> 01:56:34,050
don't say that eating is lettuce or tell
him fuck.

2381
01:56:34,051 --> 01:56:36,360
It's not true.
It's not true because it's a fact.

2382
01:56:36,760 --> 01:56:37,593
You can,
I know without saying it's a bad 

2383
01:56:38,851 --> 01:56:41,550
example,
but that thing that people like to do,

2384
01:56:41,790 --> 01:56:46,740
it's a fat little fuck man.
I mean yeah that it's a fact fucking guy

2385
01:56:46,860 --> 01:56:50,820
is our version of a person who has been,
it happens in North Korea.

2386
01:56:50,821 --> 01:56:51,654
There's that like,
I don't know if you saw it but like in 

2387
01:56:53,791 --> 01:56:55,260
one of these documentaries about North 
Korea,

2388
01:56:55,261 --> 01:56:57,450
which I love to watch cause it's the 
ultimate example.

2389
01:56:57,450 --> 01:57:02,310
If a hypnotize culture when you submit 
ultimate and it's right now right now,

2390
01:57:02,400 --> 01:57:05,820
which is insane when you consider what 
the past could have been like.

2391
01:57:06,450 --> 01:57:07,920
We never,
we don't have a window.

2392
01:57:08,430 --> 01:57:10,830
We don't have a window into what gingiss
Khan's empire was like.

2393
01:57:10,831 --> 01:57:13,050
We don't have a window to Mao's China.
We don't have a window to that,

2394
01:57:13,210 --> 01:57:16,650
but we have a window right now.
A fucking physical window of real video.

2395
01:57:16,680 --> 01:57:17,513
This is it.
This is the guy does a no nonsense guy 

2396
01:57:19,170 --> 01:57:20,003
play the commercial.
I love this crash will go from the 

2397
01:57:21,061 --> 01:57:23,680
beginning to it from the beginning.
Yeah.

2398
01:57:24,560 --> 01:57:27,470
These bells,
it drug money,

2399
01:57:27,471 --> 01:57:28,400
funds,
terror.

2400
01:57:28,460 --> 01:57:31,370
It's a ploy.
Manipulation.

2401
01:57:33,150 --> 01:57:35,210
Got Jamie.
Why should I believe that?

2402
01:57:35,211 --> 01:57:36,110
New to the Internet,

2403
01:57:36,600 --> 01:57:38,550
he's got several tabs going at the same 
time.

2404
01:57:39,180 --> 01:57:41,490
You're going to hear him moaning soon 
because he's got his porn.

2405
01:57:41,790 --> 01:57:44,850
It's a ploy.
It's drug money,

2406
01:57:44,851 --> 01:57:45,750
funds,
terror.

2407
01:57:45,760 --> 01:57:50,760
It's deploying Laurie manipulation like 
he's eating drug money,

2408
01:57:50,941 --> 01:57:51,631
ploys,
terror.

2409
01:57:51,631 --> 01:57:54,130
I mean why should I believe that?
Because it's a fat,

2410
01:57:55,240 --> 01:57:56,870
fat,
fat.

2411
01:57:58,230 --> 01:58:00,870
So you're saying that I shouldn't 
believe it because it's true.

2412
01:58:01,230 --> 01:58:02,550
That's,
that's your argument.

2413
01:58:02,970 --> 01:58:03,803
It is true.

2414
01:58:07,230 --> 01:58:08,730
This is the dumbest fucking 
conversation.

2415
01:58:08,731 --> 01:58:10,590
Cause I want to jump in there and I say,
okay,

2416
01:58:10,680 --> 01:58:14,010
well tell me how that's true.
Let me give me some specifics.

2417
01:58:14,011 --> 01:58:16,620
I talk to you about money funds to her.
Can I tell you it's true?

2418
01:58:16,650 --> 01:58:17,251
If you're,
yeah,

2419
01:58:17,251 --> 01:58:18,420
you're the guy.
I'm the other guy.

2420
01:58:18,450 --> 01:58:19,530
Here's how it's true.
Okay.

2421
01:58:19,710 --> 01:58:21,210
So,
um,

2422
01:58:21,840 --> 01:58:22,673
many of the people who are currently in 
the u s government have taken lots of 

2423
01:58:27,541 --> 01:58:28,374
money from the pharmaceutical companies 
that supply some of the most dangerous 

2424
01:58:34,351 --> 01:58:38,100
drugs on earth to people all over the 
planet.

2425
01:58:38,410 --> 01:58:39,010
And,
and,

2426
01:58:39,010 --> 01:58:39,843
and those people in the government are 
also in charge of dropping bombs on 

2427
01:58:44,321 --> 01:58:47,260
people in other parts of the world.
Stop you right there.

2428
01:58:47,530 --> 01:58:51,280
They also made Viagara and the pill.
That's great.

2429
01:58:51,370 --> 01:58:52,690
Okay.
That was great.

2430
01:58:52,860 --> 01:58:54,430
Oh,
choose Viagara don't you like the pill?

2431
01:58:54,431 --> 01:58:55,264
Drugs?
Don't you like to shoot loads and you 

2432
01:58:56,201 --> 01:58:57,340
grow without any consequences?

2433
01:58:57,670 --> 01:58:58,720
Yes,
I know.

2434
01:58:58,721 --> 01:59:00,820
We all do have,
that's funding terrorism.

2435
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,130
Every time you shoot a load into your 
girl,

2436
01:59:03,520 --> 01:59:06,020
that's fun.
Are you sure?

2437
01:59:06,710 --> 01:59:11,430
Is it a fact?
Is it an fmct fat dude?

2438
01:59:11,530 --> 01:59:13,090
Terrorism?
Fuck.

2439
01:59:13,150 --> 01:59:14,500
I'll tell you.
Fucking terrorism.

2440
01:59:14,680 --> 01:59:16,480
Terrorism is every time.
I mean,

2441
01:59:16,481 --> 01:59:17,314
when you start hearing the civilian 
casualties in Syria and all over the 

2442
01:59:19,721 --> 01:59:20,810
fucking place,
show you something.

2443
01:59:20,830 --> 01:59:23,500
I'm going to show you something.
Go back a few days on my,

2444
01:59:23,501 --> 01:59:25,090
um,
my twitter feed.

2445
01:59:25,091 --> 01:59:29,200
I retweeted this Syrian girl who was a 
praying,

2446
01:59:29,530 --> 01:59:29,991
oh,
I saw it.

2447
01:59:29,991 --> 01:59:31,090
I saw her.
Safety.

2448
01:59:31,091 --> 01:59:31,960
You've seen it.
Right.

2449
01:59:31,961 --> 01:59:32,794
Again,
if you want to horrify the fucking 

2450
01:59:33,431 --> 01:59:35,140
audience,
but I'd rather not watch it again.

2451
01:59:35,170 --> 01:59:36,670
Okay,
well let's just describe what it is.

2452
01:59:37,020 --> 01:59:37,600
Um,
you could,

2453
01:59:37,600 --> 01:59:38,920
you can go watch yourself.
Forget it Jamie.

2454
01:59:39,640 --> 01:59:41,410
He's gonna Freak out.
I was ready to cry.

2455
01:59:41,860 --> 01:59:43,660
I'm ready to cry.
It's horrible.

2456
01:59:43,660 --> 01:59:47,350
There's a guy and he's talking to his 
daughter and she's reciting a prayer and

2457
01:59:47,351 --> 01:59:52,030
apparently she's reciting some prayer of
safety and while they're doing it,

2458
01:59:52,031 --> 01:59:57,031
you here and they both get shot like 
rocketed back and forth.

2459
02:00:00,460 --> 02:00:04,030
Like something hit near their building.
You see like the reverberations,

2460
02:00:04,031 --> 02:00:06,560
the impact move them.
They,

2461
02:00:06,570 --> 02:00:08,590
they jut out of the frame and then the 
video stops.

2462
02:00:09,040 --> 02:00:10,210
It's terrifying.
I mean,

2463
02:00:10,600 --> 02:00:13,300
look,
it might not even be real.

2464
02:00:13,380 --> 02:00:14,740
I'm,
I'm assuming it's real.

2465
02:00:14,920 --> 02:00:17,410
I'm assuming it's real.
It might not even be real,

2466
02:00:17,740 --> 02:00:18,970
but it,
cause I don't know,

2467
02:00:18,971 --> 02:00:19,804
I can't verify it.
But that happens exactly the way you're 

2468
02:00:22,901 --> 02:00:23,734
looking at it.
Whether or not that is an actual 

2469
02:00:24,881 --> 02:00:25,714
representation or whether or not 
somebody wants you to imagine what it 

2470
02:00:28,001 --> 02:00:29,350
would be like.
I don't know.

2471
02:00:29,351 --> 02:00:30,550
I don't know the veracity.
I haven't,

2472
02:00:30,610 --> 02:00:33,250
I haven't studied the video.
I don't know.

2473
02:00:33,340 --> 02:00:34,173
Have you,
do you know whether or not anybody's 

2474
02:00:34,790 --> 02:00:36,640
calling bullshit on that video?
Well,

2475
02:00:36,641 --> 02:00:37,460
look,
I mean it's,

2476
02:00:37,460 --> 02:00:38,620
yeah,
they do bond.

2477
02:00:38,680 --> 02:00:39,513
Exactly.
But I'm not sure if you're seeing that 

2478
02:00:41,290 --> 02:00:42,130
or if it's one of the,
you know,

2479
02:00:42,131 --> 02:00:43,690
there's a,
there's a company that was a,

2480
02:00:43,700 --> 02:00:44,533
I think it's an Australia that uh,
they create fake viral videos to get 

2481
02:00:48,881 --> 02:00:52,360
hits and they're a special effects 
company and they've,

2482
02:00:52,390 --> 02:00:55,840
they're responsible for like a gang of 
amazing videos that have been online.

2483
02:00:55,841 --> 02:01:00,440
One of them was this,
a couple that shot a lion and then you,

2484
02:01:00,470 --> 02:01:01,910
you see the lion,
uh,

2485
02:01:01,920 --> 02:01:04,540
another line there.
They're standing over taking pictures.

2486
02:01:04,541 --> 02:01:07,300
Yeah.
This one special effects group made that

2487
02:01:07,330 --> 02:01:08,163
and a bunch of other fake ones too,
that a lot of people sent me and they 

2488
02:01:10,781 --> 02:01:12,490
said they were real and I retweeted them
like,

2489
02:01:12,491 --> 02:01:13,410
oh wow,
that's crazy.

2490
02:01:14,050 --> 02:01:14,883
You know,
but meanwhile these people are just 

2491
02:01:15,341 --> 02:01:16,420
special effects artists.

2492
02:01:16,440 --> 02:01:18,130
Cool.
The line one didn't get me,

2493
02:01:18,700 --> 02:01:20,830
I was like,
this is too perfectly framed.

2494
02:01:21,070 --> 02:01:22,660
It's too good.
It got me,

2495
02:01:23,110 --> 02:01:24,340
didn't get me at all.
Plus,

2496
02:01:24,341 --> 02:01:27,040
I didn't like the way that the line,
the way it was looking though.

2497
02:01:27,060 --> 02:01:29,290
It was sitting there on the ground.
It looked fake.

2498
02:01:29,500 --> 02:01:31,240
The whole thing looked like it looked 
like a fake lie.

2499
02:01:31,690 --> 02:01:36,070
But then there's one that came out today
that I'm a reasonably sure is real.

2500
02:01:36,250 --> 02:01:38,020
And this one I was telling you about 
before the show,

2501
02:01:38,021 --> 02:01:40,580
but there's a bear in this guy's house 
and uh,

2502
02:01:40,670 --> 02:01:44,630
he looks downstairs in my friend Shane 
Carwyn actually tweeted a picture.

2503
02:01:44,660 --> 02:01:45,493
I've got a retweet it when I find it.
He tweeted me a picture today of a 

2504
02:01:48,201 --> 02:01:51,680
fucking bear that broke into his 
friend's cabin and tore it apart.

2505
02:01:52,040 --> 02:01:52,761
Tore the,
uh,

2506
02:01:52,761 --> 02:01:55,910
the frigerator open,
ripped out everything on the floor,

2507
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,460
ripped out cabinets,
just tore his fucking place bar.

2508
02:01:58,610 --> 02:02:00,710
And apparently his friend called Shane 
is like,

2509
02:02:00,740 --> 02:02:01,760
ah,
hey dude,

2510
02:02:01,761 --> 02:02:04,130
did you uh,
use my cabin or something?

2511
02:02:04,660 --> 02:02:07,880
Cause I know Shane Collins is giant 
heavyweight UFC fighter.

2512
02:02:08,270 --> 02:02:09,220
He's a former,
uh,

2513
02:02:09,340 --> 02:02:11,600
UFC interim heavyweight champion.
He's a gorilla.

2514
02:02:11,780 --> 02:02:13,850
And so his friend,
like that's the first person he called.

2515
02:02:13,940 --> 02:02:16,100
Imagine if someone tears through your 
house,

2516
02:02:16,101 --> 02:02:18,380
Richard Fucker,
refrigerated door off the wall,

2517
02:02:18,620 --> 02:02:19,453
this foot plate waste like they eat 
someone just fucking hulked out in your 

2518
02:02:22,641 --> 02:02:26,120
kitchen.
So they call Shane up for is hey dude,

2519
02:02:26,420 --> 02:02:29,840
um,
my cabin rip my refrigerator door off.

2520
02:02:29,900 --> 02:02:32,120
And then there was another one.
That's true as well.

2521
02:02:32,121 --> 02:02:35,240
It's real where a bear got trapped in 
someone's car,

2522
02:02:35,690 --> 02:02:37,700
somehow know that the bear opened the 
car door,

2523
02:02:37,701 --> 02:02:39,890
which they've been known to do.
If you leave it open,

2524
02:02:40,120 --> 02:02:40,953
look at that.
That's a bear trap in the back of that 

2525
02:02:42,411 --> 02:02:44,020
fucking Subaru poor guy.

2526
02:02:44,020 --> 02:02:46,310
I wonder how long and he's in there for,
it's a good question.

2527
02:02:46,340 --> 02:02:48,050
I think they were walking by and they 
found them.

2528
02:02:48,440 --> 02:02:53,330
So what a bear does is they know,
they figured out over time that they can

2529
02:02:53,331 --> 02:02:55,520
open car doors.
If they open up a car door,

2530
02:02:55,521 --> 02:02:57,710
they watch someone open up a car door,
I'll get another bear.

2531
02:02:57,920 --> 02:03:01,280
And then there's food in there.
That's it from then on there opening car

2532
02:03:01,281 --> 02:03:04,190
doors.
So while when I was in boulder,

2533
02:03:04,220 --> 02:03:07,520
one of the people that lived in the town
over from where I lived,

2534
02:03:07,670 --> 02:03:11,810
got their car broken into and the bear 
ate the inside of their car.

2535
02:03:12,260 --> 02:03:14,420
The bear,
I mean literally ate their seats.

2536
02:03:14,450 --> 02:03:15,560
Eight,
their dashboard,

2537
02:03:15,590 --> 02:03:18,670
Dan,
the crazy sucks.

2538
02:03:18,671 --> 02:03:21,320
So this bear is trapped in this guy's 
car.

2539
02:03:21,440 --> 02:03:22,273
This is 100% legit.
So you opens up the car door with his 

2540
02:03:24,141 --> 02:03:25,760
paws,
climbs inside.

2541
02:03:25,761 --> 02:03:26,594
And you know,
like if a car is like at a kind of an 

2542
02:03:27,381 --> 02:03:28,690
angle,
the door will close itself.

2543
02:03:29,210 --> 02:03:30,390
Door closes itself.
He's like,

2544
02:03:30,600 --> 02:03:35,600
Whoa,
just stuck in his car.

2545
02:03:38,571 --> 02:03:39,830
Just mangling it.
Look at it,

2546
02:03:39,831 --> 02:03:41,630
look at the chair,
torn apart.

2547
02:03:41,840 --> 02:03:44,030
Probably shitting all over the 
dashboard.

2548
02:03:44,220 --> 02:03:45,700
I'm good.
I'm right here.

2549
02:03:46,170 --> 02:03:47,003
I wonder if their insurance coverage,
I wonder if anybody's got a bow and 

2550
02:03:49,471 --> 02:03:53,440
Arrow coming to make some bare sausage 
son.

2551
02:03:54,420 --> 02:03:55,860
Uh,
you gotta let him out.

2552
02:03:55,970 --> 02:03:59,220
I means that's fucked up.
Shoot an animal inside a car.

2553
02:03:59,310 --> 02:04:00,360
That's not fair.
Chase.

2554
02:04:00,450 --> 02:04:01,740
I'm joking around.
Ladies and gentlemen.

2555
02:04:01,970 --> 02:04:02,803
I would definitely let them out,
but I'd be fucking pissed because this 

2556
02:04:04,291 --> 02:04:07,020
car is just shot.
It's mangled.

2557
02:04:07,410 --> 02:04:09,390
You can open up your trunk with a,
uh,

2558
02:04:09,510 --> 02:04:11,820
a key and with some people does that,
what they did,

2559
02:04:11,850 --> 02:04:13,290
did they open up the bag and let him 
out?

2560
02:04:14,670 --> 02:04:15,503
What's happening here?
How can the hatches open areas just ran 

2561
02:04:18,481 --> 02:04:22,920
off and he's running off.
That was a pretty decent sized bear yet.

2562
02:04:23,130 --> 02:04:25,660
What kind of damage did it do?
Pretty peaceful man.

2563
02:04:25,661 --> 02:04:28,770
Bears always seem like they run,
they tend to run for sure.

2564
02:04:28,830 --> 02:04:29,670
Right?
Until they kill you.

2565
02:04:30,210 --> 02:04:31,260
Yeah.
You say,

2566
02:04:31,261 --> 02:04:32,130
oh,
it's peaceful.

2567
02:04:32,930 --> 02:04:33,763
It's peaceful.
Do you know more people get killed by 

2568
02:04:35,191 --> 02:04:36,990
black bears then by grizzlies?
No.

2569
02:04:37,050 --> 02:04:38,030
Did Not.
It's

2570
02:04:38,040 --> 02:04:38,873
weird.
Grizzlies a lot of times the key by 

2571
02:04:40,051 --> 02:04:43,170
accident like a,
you stumble upon the mom and the cubs,

2572
02:04:43,171 --> 02:04:44,004
right?
Black bears apparently will actively 

2573
02:04:45,991 --> 02:04:48,270
seek people sometimes when they're 
really desperate.

2574
02:04:48,330 --> 02:04:49,470
Oh my God,
man.

2575
02:04:49,471 --> 02:04:50,191
That is,
fuck.

2576
02:04:50,191 --> 02:04:51,024
There's a bear.
My neighbor had suppose how's the past 

2577
02:04:53,161 --> 02:04:53,994
dean of bears are eating garbage and 
stuff or having a good old time and 

2578
02:04:55,651 --> 02:04:57,540
swimming pools and shit.
You don't have to worry about them.

2579
02:04:57,780 --> 02:04:58,980
You got to worry about,
um,

2580
02:04:59,370 --> 02:05:00,203
predatory bear.
It's like there's a guy that I know 

2581
02:05:01,710 --> 02:05:02,543
steve or Hosa show meter.
One of his friends took a guy out 

2582
02:05:06,811 --> 02:05:07,644
hunting for his very first time they 
were camping and a 500 pound predatory 

2583
02:05:10,261 --> 02:05:13,770
black bear climb.
The 10 attacked him in the middle of the

2584
02:05:13,771 --> 02:05:14,604
night and his friends shot the bear.
The bullet went through the bear and 

2585
02:05:17,521 --> 02:05:20,310
shot his friend in the wrist so he got 
shot.

2586
02:05:20,730 --> 02:05:25,170
He got bit by a bear is first hunting 
trips cause arrest.

2587
02:05:25,560 --> 02:05:28,860
Bullet shattered his wrist,
went through the baron shatters wrist.

2588
02:05:28,920 --> 02:05:29,753
That's tough man.
Whenever you have those kinds of bad 

2589
02:05:31,231 --> 02:05:35,490
lucks land on top of each other,
like the balloon accident where like not

2590
02:05:35,491 --> 02:05:36,324
only do you fall to your death,
but you're also on fire while you fall 

2591
02:05:39,031 --> 02:05:40,650
to your death.
17 people.

2592
02:05:40,760 --> 02:05:42,990
Terrible fuck hot air balloons,
dude.

2593
02:05:43,050 --> 02:05:43,650
Fuck,
fuck.

2594
02:05:43,650 --> 02:05:46,140
Being in the sky with fire and cloth.
Never.

2595
02:05:46,320 --> 02:05:47,153
What about a hard breeze?
What happens if this bitch gets hit by 

2596
02:05:49,231 --> 02:05:50,130
lightning?
Huh?

2597
02:05:50,680 --> 02:05:53,220
You ever fucking monkeys?
I watched the video.

2598
02:05:53,240 --> 02:05:54,570
That guy jumping out of the plane.
Yes.

2599
02:05:54,571 --> 02:05:55,404
Yes,
I did.

2600
02:05:56,060 --> 02:05:58,230
Insane.
10th insane.

2601
02:05:58,530 --> 02:05:59,640
Insane.
And by the way,

2602
02:05:59,641 --> 02:06:02,340
he didn't even hit it in the middle.
He hit the edge.

2603
02:06:02,610 --> 02:06:05,040
I mean,
I'm sure it's a huge fucking net,

2604
02:06:05,190 --> 02:06:06,480
but not huge enough.

2605
02:06:06,720 --> 02:06:10,860
Like how you judging that correctly when
you're coming down at who knows how fast

2606
02:06:10,861 --> 02:06:11,694
he's coming down.
He lays there for a second until like 

2607
02:06:13,350 --> 02:06:16,380
he's stunned or sad.
A flip over before impact.

2608
02:06:16,390 --> 02:06:17,223
She was practicing flipping over like he
had otherwise his face is going to get 

2609
02:06:20,521 --> 02:06:21,420
shredded,
right?

2610
02:06:21,600 --> 02:06:22,433
He's got to land on his back.
So this guy's going down and then right 

2611
02:06:25,621 --> 02:06:27,750
before he hits the bottom,
he flips.

2612
02:06:27,840 --> 02:06:32,120
So he's got to like guide himself with 
his own fucking arms and he hosted,

2613
02:06:32,121 --> 02:06:35,400
he doesn't splatter.
That's his gopro man.

2614
02:06:35,940 --> 02:06:38,400
I mean,
how is he possibly going to judge this?

2615
02:06:38,910 --> 02:06:40,260
I mean,
he has some sort of a,

2616
02:06:40,261 --> 02:06:44,340
a like a wingspan thing going on,
whereas his legs are spread.

2617
02:06:44,341 --> 02:06:45,930
Now Watch this,
she falls over,

2618
02:06:46,380 --> 02:06:49,650
he turns over right before the end and,
and lands in the net.

2619
02:06:50,070 --> 02:06:53,070
What in the actual fuck.
And everybody's applauding.

2620
02:06:56,830 --> 02:06:59,830
It's Bobby Collins and Whoopi Goldberg.
They're,

2621
02:06:59,831 --> 02:07:00,720
they're,
they're both selling.

2622
02:07:02,680 --> 02:07:04,430
Hey,
almost doug.

2623
02:07:05,590 --> 02:07:05,800
He's,

2624
02:07:05,800 --> 02:07:06,580
he's,
he's,

2625
02:07:06,580 --> 02:07:07,600
he's crying.
Oh dude,

2626
02:07:07,601 --> 02:07:10,150
it mom,
this girl's got big tits.

2627
02:07:10,240 --> 02:07:12,340
Come here.
Take a look at these teds before.

2628
02:07:12,490 --> 02:07:13,690
Hey,
this guy will get his deck.

2629
02:07:16,490 --> 02:07:18,820
Why they have these people?
Look at this.

2630
02:07:19,390 --> 02:07:23,320
We are here live on the scene.
He didn't die.

2631
02:07:23,590 --> 02:07:27,550
It's amazing.
This is the first time ever a person did

2632
02:07:27,551 --> 02:07:30,880
this and lived.
We're so happy.

2633
02:07:31,330 --> 02:07:33,700
We're so happy we could broadcast this 
on television.

2634
02:07:33,730 --> 02:07:34,930
It's so important.
Look at,

2635
02:07:35,320 --> 02:07:36,153
yes

2636
02:07:36,220 --> 02:07:37,300
we do,
dude.

2637
02:07:37,390 --> 02:07:40,150
We did it.
You crazy fuckers.

2638
02:07:40,330 --> 02:07:42,010
All of you.
Oh my God.

2639
02:07:42,011 --> 02:07:44,050
Cause you know if that shit didn't work 
out,

2640
02:07:44,080 --> 02:07:44,913
oh my God,
the net broke and for the rest of your 

2641
02:07:46,391 --> 02:07:47,224
life,
you have to remember that the what that 

2642
02:07:49,031 --> 02:07:53,200
looks like a just the explosion Godson,
the,

2643
02:07:53,620 --> 02:07:57,310
that sound that's going to make,
when that thing hits the fucking tarmac,

2644
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:03,000
his wife's screaming or just a silent 
scream.

2645
02:08:03,370 --> 02:08:05,710
Just everyone.
Just Ptsd.

2646
02:08:05,711 --> 02:08:07,660
You're going to have to go to a 
therapist to get that out of your head.

2647
02:08:07,661 --> 02:08:12,370
You're going to wake up with the memory 
of that guy's body just exploding like a

2648
02:08:12,670 --> 02:08:16,960
fucking watermelon in front of you.
What if the pressure of the situation,

2649
02:08:16,961 --> 02:08:18,300
the gravity of the situation,
the,

2650
02:08:18,301 --> 02:08:19,134
the adrenaline rush and the g force all 
combined made him stroke out like that 

2651
02:08:24,251 --> 02:08:25,084
Indian dude and he just never even 
bothered steering and went right into 

2652
02:08:27,851 --> 02:08:28,684
the crowd.

2653
02:08:29,910 --> 02:08:30,743
Oh Man.
Like a human messel just took out kids 

2654
02:08:34,871 --> 02:08:39,871
and fucking grandma crushed a subaru 
scraps of bloody gatorade color jumpsuit

2655
02:08:41,380 --> 02:08:45,250
landing on your kid.
Imagine if you died because this guy hit

2656
02:08:45,251 --> 02:08:46,084
the ground and his skull went flying 
through the air and hit you in the face 

2657
02:08:50,170 --> 02:08:51,003
and crush your head.
You got your head crushed from his 

2658
02:08:53,051 --> 02:08:54,130
forehead.
Or even worse,

2659
02:08:54,131 --> 02:08:57,940
you don't die.
You just get like amputated.

2660
02:08:57,960 --> 02:09:00,160
No,
you just have like neurological problems

2661
02:09:00,161 --> 02:09:01,990
for the rest of your life.
Like you like,

2662
02:09:02,110 --> 02:09:02,943
you know,
like someone is in a car accident and 

2663
02:09:04,050 --> 02:09:06,220
you go into a temporary when he come out
you,

2664
02:09:06,460 --> 02:09:09,280
you shit yourself for the rest of your 
life and people ask why?

2665
02:09:09,281 --> 02:09:12,820
It's like a skydiver skull smashed into 
me.

2666
02:09:13,870 --> 02:09:15,940
Terrible man.
Fuck Dude.

2667
02:09:16,630 --> 02:09:18,640
High impact.
Avoid that.

2668
02:09:19,030 --> 02:09:21,130
What high impact?
High impact.

2669
02:09:21,131 --> 02:09:21,964
Avoid that.
Don't jump out of those planes into 

2670
02:09:24,101 --> 02:09:24,610
nuts.

2671
02:09:24,610 --> 02:09:25,443
Stop.
Are they going to get fucking cte from 

2672
02:09:28,031 --> 02:09:30,550
net falling?
Imagine if that becomes a new thing.

2673
02:09:30,760 --> 02:09:33,400
What's what kind of cte,
chronic traumatic,

2674
02:09:33,401 --> 02:09:35,510
chronic traumatic encephalopathy and 
stuff.

2675
02:09:36,190 --> 02:09:38,560
So brain damaged the football players 
get,

2676
02:09:38,770 --> 02:09:39,603
I would imagine the jolt of going from 
space into a fucking net is 

2677
02:09:42,551 --> 02:09:43,750
considerable.
Yeah,

2678
02:09:43,751 --> 02:09:44,321
sure.
Yeah,

2679
02:09:44,321 --> 02:09:45,154
I would imagine that that has an impact 
on your fucking don't easy on your 

2680
02:09:47,501 --> 02:09:50,140
fucking body to fall out of a plane in 
anything.

2681
02:09:50,141 --> 02:09:52,840
It's definitely not what you,
by the way,

2682
02:09:52,841 --> 02:09:53,674
man.
Speaking of like fucked up like sports 

2683
02:09:56,441 --> 02:09:59,350
accidents and I know you get sick of 
talking about the UFC,

2684
02:09:59,351 --> 02:10:03,070
but dude,
that fucking clip of,

2685
02:10:03,071 --> 02:10:04,270
what's his name?
Cyborg.

2686
02:10:04,271 --> 02:10:05,104
What's the guy's name?
The guy that when I bought Santos is a 

2687
02:10:10,181 --> 02:10:11,014
bunch of cyborgs.
There's a two male cyborgs and one 

2688
02:10:13,421 --> 02:10:14,560
female,
so it makes sense.

2689
02:10:14,561 --> 02:10:18,490
It's a cool word,
but I was thinking man,

2690
02:10:19,510 --> 02:10:22,520
that thing he did the knee kick flying 
knee kick smashed.

2691
02:10:22,530 --> 02:10:24,010
The guys handled.
Ever say knee kick.

2692
02:10:24,011 --> 02:10:24,970
Don't ever say,
what'd he say?

2693
02:10:25,030 --> 02:10:27,310
It's a knee flying knee.
You don't see a knee kick.

2694
02:10:27,311 --> 02:10:29,560
Guys,
listen to my voice.

2695
02:10:29,561 --> 02:10:31,760
Do I sound like I know a lot about the 
USC,

2696
02:10:31,810 --> 02:10:33,760
a little Moitai back in the,
well,

2697
02:10:33,790 --> 02:10:34,030
my

2698
02:10:34,030 --> 02:10:36,490
trainer taught me some.
But anyway,

2699
02:10:36,910 --> 02:10:40,180
the point is,
is it possible,

2700
02:10:40,210 --> 02:10:41,043
you know,
k basketball people are getting better 

2701
02:10:42,071 --> 02:10:43,140
at basketball,
right?

2702
02:10:43,690 --> 02:10:45,880
Skateboarding people are getting better 
at skateboarding.

2703
02:10:46,420 --> 02:10:47,253
Is it possible that in the UFC people 
are going to become so proficient at 

2704
02:10:51,850 --> 02:10:56,850
beating each other up that it,
there will be more of this type of awful

2705
02:10:58,661 --> 02:11:03,661
accident happening where people just 
learn how to be powerful enough to crush

2706
02:11:03,941 --> 02:11:07,090
a person's skull where you just get 
better at it,

2707
02:11:07,091 --> 02:11:09,010
man.
Like if you look at like,

2708
02:11:09,370 --> 02:11:11,900
and it's not a fair comparison because 
this Pa skateboard you,

2709
02:11:11,950 --> 02:11:12,783
it requires a tool.
But if you look at like early 

2710
02:11:14,681 --> 02:11:19,300
skateboarding videos to now and see how 
much it's evolved and you know,

2711
02:11:19,301 --> 02:11:20,134
the UFC has the market pressure for 
these fighters to be the best ever 

2712
02:11:23,771 --> 02:11:27,550
because they become like world renowned 
fighters and they make a lot of money.

2713
02:11:27,670 --> 02:11:32,670
So the pressure is there to evolve.
If you look at UFC 100 years from now,

2714
02:11:33,580 --> 02:11:34,413
isn't it possible that fighters are 
going to get so good that it is no 

2715
02:11:38,081 --> 02:11:38,914
longer safe to do the UFC because 
they're just going to be strong enough 

2716
02:11:43,481 --> 02:11:47,680
to break someone's skull open with their
fucking fists or with their knees?

2717
02:11:48,100 --> 02:11:48,881
Well,
let me answer that.

2718
02:11:48,881 --> 02:11:49,714
First of all,
it was a very unusual scenario where a 

2719
02:11:52,571 --> 02:11:53,404
guy was diving forward and the other guy
was jumping forward with the name and 

2720
02:11:56,861 --> 02:11:59,630
they combined in a perfect collision.
Right.

2721
02:11:59,670 --> 02:12:03,250
It's very unusual to happen that way.
It's happened before though.

2722
02:12:03,580 --> 02:12:04,600
Um,
it,

2723
02:12:04,720 --> 02:12:07,450
it does happen.
It can happen.

2724
02:12:07,810 --> 02:12:11,110
But that was the most extreme version of
ever seen in my life.

2725
02:12:11,530 --> 02:12:13,600
And all my years of watching martial 
arts,

2726
02:12:13,660 --> 02:12:16,690
watching martial arts training and 
martial arts,

2727
02:12:16,900 --> 02:12:17,733
seeing fights,
I don't know how many fights I've seen 

2728
02:12:19,450 --> 02:12:22,540
live,
but it's gotta be more than a thousand.

2729
02:12:22,630 --> 02:12:23,490
It's probably what,
sure.

2730
02:12:23,590 --> 02:12:25,930
It's probably like 1500 or something 
like that live.

2731
02:12:25,960 --> 02:12:28,240
I've never seen it once.
I only watched it once on TV.

2732
02:12:28,630 --> 02:12:29,463
So,
um,

2733
02:12:29,470 --> 02:12:31,270
guys have definitely gotten their nose 
broken though.

2734
02:12:31,271 --> 02:12:33,040
And they've definitely gotten their 
orbits broken.

2735
02:12:33,130 --> 02:12:34,750
The orbit broken,
orbital,

2736
02:12:35,080 --> 02:12:37,150
orbital a bone is super common.

2737
02:12:37,390 --> 02:12:39,130
That's real common.
That happens all the time.

2738
02:12:39,280 --> 02:12:41,540
That happens like once a year.
I mean in the,

2739
02:12:41,600 --> 02:12:44,020
in that sense of calm and more,
maybe even more than that.

2740
02:12:44,021 --> 02:12:46,000
We don't hear about it.
Maybe they're small fractures,

2741
02:12:46,001 --> 02:12:46,834
but like Misha tate,
the former women's bantamweight 

2742
02:12:48,731 --> 02:12:49,564
champion,
she got her orbital bone broken in a 

2743
02:12:50,411 --> 02:12:51,760
fight.
Um,

2744
02:12:52,300 --> 02:12:53,133
Bob psats ha.
He had Bob Sapp had his orbital bone 

2745
02:12:54,790 --> 02:12:56,210
broken in by cro cop.
Uh,

2746
02:12:56,211 --> 02:12:58,660
I can name a bunch of them were guys who
have gotten their orbital broken.

2747
02:12:58,661 --> 02:13:00,640
It's really common.
So,

2748
02:13:00,641 --> 02:13:01,840
uh,
that's your face.

2749
02:13:01,841 --> 02:13:02,780
You're getting your face broke.
It,

2750
02:13:02,781 --> 02:13:05,980
this is just a different version of it.
And it was such an extreme impact.

2751
02:13:06,010 --> 02:13:09,010
Michael Venom page,
the guy who did it is a,

2752
02:13:09,011 --> 02:13:12,670
a sport karate champion and a really 
dynamic guy.

2753
02:13:12,850 --> 02:13:16,750
He's so fucking fast and his technique 
is so good.

2754
02:13:16,990 --> 02:13:18,550
His timing is so good.

2755
02:13:18,700 --> 02:13:23,700
He's a lifelong martial artists who was 
competing as a point karate guy.

2756
02:13:23,831 --> 02:13:24,664
And then he went from being a point 
karate guy to fighting and mma and he 

2757
02:13:27,431 --> 02:13:28,264
can hit guys in this crazy way,
dives in and hits them and they can't 

2758
02:13:31,260 --> 02:13:32,580
him back.
And when they were running at him,

2759
02:13:32,581 --> 02:13:35,160
he counters them brilliantly.
And that's what he did in this fight.

2760
02:13:35,430 --> 02:13:38,850
Cyborg who's talented guy who has been 
around a long time,

2761
02:13:38,851 --> 02:13:41,310
he's really experienced,
he's fought in strikeforce.

2762
02:13:41,311 --> 02:13:44,640
He fought in the UFC and the UFC.
I feel like he did.

2763
02:13:44,940 --> 02:13:47,110
I'm almost positive he did.
Um,

2764
02:13:47,400 --> 02:13:49,380
Google that though please.
Cause I know he fought in strikeforce.

2765
02:13:49,381 --> 02:13:50,214
He had an epic fight with Nick Diaz and 
strike force and Jordan Meehan and 

2766
02:13:53,450 --> 02:13:56,790
strike force epic epic fights.
So he's a real veteran.

2767
02:13:57,210 --> 02:13:58,043
And uh,
to have this happen to him is even more 

2768
02:14:00,181 --> 02:14:02,100
impressive.
It just shows you how good this page kid

2769
02:14:02,101 --> 02:14:02,790
is.

2770
02:14:02,790 --> 02:14:05,280
But um,
it's so unusual the way it happened.

2771
02:14:05,370 --> 02:14:06,203
I've never seen it like that before 
where a guy just charged in and the 

2772
02:14:08,611 --> 02:14:12,150
other guy didn't hit,
just hit him with the need put jumped at

2773
02:14:12,151 --> 02:14:12,984
him.
So you'd have to have Michael Venom 

2774
02:14:13,981 --> 02:14:15,680
pages,
athleticism,

2775
02:14:15,990 --> 02:14:17,940
technique,
experience,

2776
02:14:18,150 --> 02:14:20,790
lifelong martial artist.
Perfect timing.

2777
02:14:20,910 --> 02:14:21,743
And then also fight intelligence.
Like he had the intelligence to choose 

2778
02:14:25,111 --> 02:14:27,360
that weapon.
He has a full arsenal of techniques.

2779
02:14:27,361 --> 02:14:30,270
He knew that that would be the most 
effective blow to land in that moment.

2780
02:14:30,330 --> 02:14:31,163
So all his lifelong experience of 
competing as a martial artist led to 

2781
02:14:34,351 --> 02:14:35,184
that moment.
So it was a perfect storm for cyborgs 

2782
02:14:36,810 --> 02:14:37,643
head.
The wrong the wrong thing at the wrong 

2783
02:14:40,051 --> 02:14:40,884
time.
And it can always happen just like Dale 

2784
02:14:42,841 --> 02:14:45,870
earnhardt junior or senior died in a car
accident.

2785
02:14:46,380 --> 02:14:48,310
It can happen like the,
the,

2786
02:14:48,330 --> 02:14:51,540
even the great ones can get really badly
hurt.

2787
02:14:51,810 --> 02:14:54,240
But,
but you could see it like,

2788
02:14:54,900 --> 02:14:55,733
I mean,
I'm sure you've seen it over those 1500 

2789
02:14:57,091 --> 02:14:57,924
fights you've seen having,
you seen an evolution in the fighting 

2790
02:15:01,140 --> 02:15:03,150
styles,
but on both sides.

2791
02:15:03,390 --> 02:15:05,950
The other thing is I've seen an 
evolution in people's defense too,

2792
02:15:06,140 --> 02:15:08,670
but there's guys like mighty mouse who 
like barely get hit,

2793
02:15:09,170 --> 02:15:09,541
right.
You know,

2794
02:15:09,541 --> 02:15:11,190
and he,
and he's beating guys up,

2795
02:15:11,191 --> 02:15:12,024
but occasionally you'll get a guy who is
like an elite guy and another guy is an 

2796
02:15:15,121 --> 02:15:16,670
elite guy and always cancel each other 
out.

2797
02:15:16,680 --> 02:15:17,513
People get mad,
people get mad because it's not an of 

2798
02:15:18,781 --> 02:15:22,620
action cause they're both two smart and 
they kind of like canceling each other.

2799
02:15:22,770 --> 02:15:24,600
That does happen.
That happens in fights.

2800
02:15:25,020 --> 02:15:27,780
So I just think that everybody is 
definitely getting better,

2801
02:15:27,781 --> 02:15:29,490
but their defense is getting better as 
well.

2802
02:15:29,760 --> 02:15:30,593
And it's just,
it's a sport where it's so chaotic and 

2803
02:15:33,421 --> 02:15:34,254
anyone can win by knockout if they 
connect and everyone is so fast and 

2804
02:15:37,501 --> 02:15:42,501
everyone has so much technique that the 
best guys can knock out the best guys.

2805
02:15:42,540 --> 02:15:44,490
We saw it this weekend.
Matt Brown,

2806
02:15:44,550 --> 02:15:47,550
who is like one of the top UFC 
welterweight in the world,

2807
02:15:47,640 --> 02:15:48,473
he's a fucking animal savage.
One of my favorite fighters ever fought 

2808
02:15:50,701 --> 02:15:52,440
this kid named Jake ellenberger.
Yeah.

2809
02:15:52,580 --> 02:15:55,320
Jake ellenberger is a very talented 
guys,

2810
02:15:55,321 --> 02:15:58,650
had ups and downs,
but he's lost a bunch of fights recently

2811
02:15:58,651 --> 02:16:01,860
to top level guys.
And this was his last chance in the UFC.

2812
02:16:01,980 --> 02:16:04,110
They gave him a last chance.
They said,

2813
02:16:04,130 --> 02:16:05,400
you know,
they were gonna cut him and he said,

2814
02:16:05,401 --> 02:16:06,690
just give me one more fight.
And they said,

2815
02:16:06,720 --> 02:16:08,300
okay,
we're going to give you matt Brown who's

2816
02:16:08,310 --> 02:16:09,780
a demon.
And he's like,

2817
02:16:09,781 --> 02:16:12,450
okay.
So he went in and knocked out Matt Brown

2818
02:16:12,451 --> 02:16:14,820
the first round,
but it was crazy.

2819
02:16:15,240 --> 02:16:16,073
It was a crazy chaos filled fight.
He blasted him with a right hand and 

2820
02:16:19,891 --> 02:16:22,080
kicked him the body with a liver kick 
and put them away.

2821
02:16:22,410 --> 02:16:25,770
It was an madness fight.
And even Matt Brown was even coming back

2822
02:16:25,771 --> 02:16:27,210
after getting hit with the first big 
punch.

2823
02:16:27,420 --> 02:16:30,490
But my point is,
on any given night,

2824
02:16:30,730 --> 02:16:34,380
one of these guys connect and they can 
knock out the other guy.

2825
02:16:34,450 --> 02:16:35,283
They can both do it.
Matt Brown easily could've knocked out 

2826
02:16:37,031 --> 02:16:41,170
ellenberger right?
Easily could have connected sales.

2827
02:16:41,280 --> 02:16:42,113
It's,
it's possible for all these guys to 

2828
02:16:45,071 --> 02:16:49,090
knock each other out.
So it's a nutty sport man.

2829
02:16:49,300 --> 02:16:51,580
So they're definitely getting better at 
it,

2830
02:16:51,970 --> 02:16:52,803
but they're all getting better.
So it's harder to hit him clean and 

2831
02:16:55,241 --> 02:16:57,010
they're better at delivering shots.
Well,

2832
02:16:57,011 --> 02:16:57,844
if one person gets better,
then everyone's going to adapt to come 

2833
02:17:01,121 --> 02:17:03,340
up with some defense for whatever.
The thing is.

2834
02:17:03,341 --> 02:17:05,050
That person's gotten better at,
I guess.

2835
02:17:05,230 --> 02:17:06,063
But he did learn the techniques,
they learn the techniques and they 

2836
02:17:07,511 --> 02:17:08,860
understand when the,
when they're coming.

2837
02:17:08,890 --> 02:17:10,780
But if you had to predict,
like if someone's,

2838
02:17:10,781 --> 02:17:11,614
like,
if you had to predict five years from 

2839
02:17:13,571 --> 02:17:15,850
now,
what kind of,

2840
02:17:15,880 --> 02:17:19,060
if you've seen a kind of evolution in 
that fighting styles,

2841
02:17:19,270 --> 02:17:20,103
then you've,
you've seen an something that maybe you 

2842
02:17:22,451 --> 02:17:25,330
can prognosticate in five years,
what do you,

2843
02:17:25,360 --> 02:17:26,800
what do you think it's going to look 
like?

2844
02:17:26,950 --> 02:17:27,783
How will it be different?
How will the UFC change over time if 

2845
02:17:31,600 --> 02:17:35,110
mixed martial arts is an evolving sport?
Well,

2846
02:17:35,111 --> 02:17:40,111
we already know pretty much I would say 
there's always room for new stuff.

2847
02:17:41,141 --> 02:17:42,970
It's always possible the new stuff comes
out.

2848
02:17:43,270 --> 02:17:44,103
But I would comfortably say we know at 
least 95% of all the striking options 

2849
02:17:48,520 --> 02:17:49,353
were pretty,
pretty well versed in what a person can 

2850
02:17:51,431 --> 02:17:53,740
do with their bones.
And I'm being real conservative.

2851
02:17:53,741 --> 02:17:54,574
When I say 95% is probably closer to 99%
but every now and then someone will do 

2852
02:17:57,941 --> 02:17:59,170
something crazy.
Like this guy,

2853
02:17:59,171 --> 02:18:00,004
uh,
I don't know the name of the 

2854
02:18:00,011 --> 02:18:00,844
organization,
but just knock some guy out with an ax 

2855
02:18:02,081 --> 02:18:02,914
kick the other day.
And somebody sent it to me and I was 

2856
02:18:04,451 --> 02:18:05,140
like,
Ooh,

2857
02:18:05,140 --> 02:18:07,150
see if he could find that ax kick Kayo 
and mma.

2858
02:18:07,151 --> 02:18:10,060
It's real recent.
This is the first time I've seen that in

2859
02:18:10,090 --> 02:18:11,620
a televised MMA bow.

2860
02:18:11,800 --> 02:18:13,780
But I saw it a gang and times and 
taekwondo tournament.

2861
02:18:13,781 --> 02:18:14,614
And I,
I,

2862
02:18:14,700 --> 02:18:17,530
I've witnessed it firsthand with a very 
good friend of mine.

2863
02:18:17,531 --> 02:18:19,510
He got knocked out horribly by an ax 
kick.

2864
02:18:19,600 --> 02:18:22,300
So I know that accidents are real 
dangerous for guys good at them,

2865
02:18:22,360 --> 02:18:23,193
but you have to have elite flexibility 
and speed and you have to know how to 

2866
02:18:25,481 --> 02:18:26,680
land it.
And,

2867
02:18:26,681 --> 02:18:29,950
uh,
so that was a new one that up until this

2868
02:18:29,950 --> 02:18:30,783
year,
I don't think anybody knocked anybody 

2869
02:18:32,231 --> 02:18:35,470
out with one before.
There was a guy named Adlon Ama golf who

2870
02:18:35,471 --> 02:18:38,650
was fighting in strikeforce and he 
fought in the UFC for a little bit,

2871
02:18:38,651 --> 02:18:40,570
but he got real religious and he decided
to,

2872
02:18:40,740 --> 02:18:43,510
to quit fighting.
But I think he might've fuck somebody up

2873
02:18:43,511 --> 02:18:45,730
with an ax kick wants he had,
he had nasty,

2874
02:18:46,030 --> 02:18:46,863
nasty kicks.
But the point is that might've been the 

2875
02:18:49,421 --> 02:18:50,254
last of the Mohicans as far as like new 
techniques that you're going to see 

2876
02:18:52,841 --> 02:18:53,674
people do.

2877
02:18:53,920 --> 02:18:55,960
Pretty much everything.
Round kicks,

2878
02:18:55,961 --> 02:18:57,040
sidekicks,
front kicks,

2879
02:18:57,060 --> 02:18:59,410
we already seen all those.
We already know they exist.

2880
02:18:59,890 --> 02:19:02,500
So that's pretty much covered.
But it's really getting,

2881
02:19:02,710 --> 02:19:03,543
what people are getting better at is 
their ability to deliver those 

2882
02:19:06,911 --> 02:19:07,744
techniques in a fluid form that's 
imperceptive both for the person's 

2883
02:19:11,380 --> 02:19:15,190
trying to anticipate the movements.
So like when someone is attacking you,

2884
02:19:15,460 --> 02:19:19,120
what it's like is say if you were a 
really dumb guy and you were in a debate

2885
02:19:19,121 --> 02:19:19,954
about Chris with Christopher hitchens 
about something that you really 

2886
02:19:22,210 --> 02:19:23,043
shouldn't have been debating for about,
like you don't really don't know the 

2887
02:19:25,031 --> 02:19:27,070
subject very well when you're talking 
shit.

2888
02:19:27,170 --> 02:19:28,070
And he just starts with

2889
02:19:28,070 --> 02:19:28,903
is he's clinking his whiskey glass 
around and touching it with his fingers 

2890
02:19:32,061 --> 02:19:35,300
and just demolish his you on on real 
time with Bill Maher.

2891
02:19:35,350 --> 02:19:36,020
Right?
Yeah.

2892
02:19:36,020 --> 02:19:36,531
You know what I mean?
Mean,

2893
02:19:36,531 --> 02:19:38,360
like Christopher hitchens could do to 
any of it.

2894
02:19:38,480 --> 02:19:40,740
So fun to watch him do that.
Too.

2895
02:19:40,970 --> 02:19:42,760
Terrifying because you would think,
oh my God,

2896
02:19:43,090 --> 02:19:43,923
what if it was me?
What if I got up there and talk about 

2897
02:19:45,111 --> 02:19:45,861
the Iraq war?
I,

2898
02:19:45,861 --> 02:19:47,350
you know what the fuck I'm talking about
me.

2899
02:19:47,690 --> 02:19:48,523
He is buried me.
Did you ever see when he buried most 

2900
02:19:50,331 --> 02:19:51,800
def?
No,

2901
02:19:51,801 --> 02:19:52,634
he hurried them.
Most def was asking questions about al 

2902
02:19:56,180 --> 02:19:58,100
Qaeda and the Taliban.
He didn't know the different in al Qaeda

2903
02:19:58,101 --> 02:19:59,570
and the Taliban.
I don't either.

2904
02:19:59,990 --> 02:20:01,690
And uh,
most def,

2905
02:20:01,760 --> 02:20:02,593
um,
was talking about it and Christopher 

2906
02:20:04,430 --> 02:20:07,520
Hitchens to society was annoying and 
just does distressed him.

2907
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:11,270
Just undressed him.
Absolutely trust him downs at the word.

2908
02:20:11,750 --> 02:20:12,330
How's like depression.

2909
02:20:12,330 --> 02:20:17,330
I would almost rather get dragged off by
a tiger and have hitchins destroy me.

2910
02:20:18,480 --> 02:20:19,350
Fuck him,
Bill.

2911
02:20:20,390 --> 02:20:23,640
You're so ruthless about become a monk.
If that happened,

2912
02:20:23,641 --> 02:20:24,474
I'd be like,
well,

2913
02:20:24,510 --> 02:20:27,450
I'm just going away.
I'm going to find a little monastery and

2914
02:20:27,451 --> 02:20:30,600
just shave my head and say goodbye to 
the universe.

2915
02:20:30,800 --> 02:20:32,720
Like there's some guys,
they can destroy you,

2916
02:20:32,930 --> 02:20:36,980
but you almost feel like a,
they're letting you off the hook.

2917
02:20:37,130 --> 02:20:37,963
Like Sam Harris.
Sam Harris destroys people in a very 

2918
02:20:40,041 --> 02:20:42,290
calm way and he doesn't insult them.
Right.

2919
02:20:42,410 --> 02:20:46,520
But he does it very logically be lets 
you know that he thinks you're retarded.

2920
02:20:46,930 --> 02:20:48,020
Right.
He wouldn't use those words,

2921
02:20:48,080 --> 02:20:49,040
but I do,
but,

2922
02:20:49,160 --> 02:20:53,540
but hitchins shows utter disdain for you
while he's scoring on it.

2923
02:20:53,770 --> 02:20:55,810
Harris seems like there's that hope 
when,

2924
02:20:55,811 --> 02:20:56,321
yeah,
when,

2925
02:20:56,321 --> 02:20:58,390
yeah,
Hitchens is pissed.

2926
02:20:58,480 --> 02:20:59,980
Harris,
it feels more like,

2927
02:21:00,100 --> 02:21:03,580
at least there's the hope that he's 
going to bring you to his side.

2928
02:21:03,790 --> 02:21:06,760
There's something compassionate in it,
but yeah.

2929
02:21:06,790 --> 02:21:08,440
Hitchins is like,
yeah,

2930
02:21:08,441 --> 02:21:09,470
hitchens is like,
well,

2931
02:21:09,940 --> 02:21:11,650
you just,
I might as well,

2932
02:21:11,920 --> 02:21:12,753
you can be part of the genocide that I 
want to have happen to idiots of the 

2933
02:21:16,331 --> 02:21:19,720
world.
And it's a really a really intense thing

2934
02:21:19,721 --> 02:21:20,554
to watch,
man.

2935
02:21:20,710 --> 02:21:23,770
He must,
he must've just constantly read.

2936
02:21:23,771 --> 02:21:28,771
Like that guy must've just woken up in 
the morning and just started reading for

2937
02:21:29,770 --> 02:21:30,581
hours.
And it was definitely,

2938
02:21:30,581 --> 02:21:30,730
yes,

2939
02:21:30,730 --> 02:21:33,670
definitely not just smart,
but also well-read.

2940
02:21:33,780 --> 02:21:34,271
Yeah.
We all,

2941
02:21:34,271 --> 02:21:37,120
we all know people that are very smart,
but they don't read that much.

2942
02:21:37,121 --> 02:21:39,400
Right.
He was all the above smart,

2943
02:21:39,401 --> 02:21:40,234
well read and did a lot of debating and 
had a lot of conversations with really 

2944
02:21:43,271 --> 02:21:45,460
smart people,
which is a big part of it as well.

2945
02:21:45,820 --> 02:21:46,653
And you know,
and we're very lucky that we get to 

2946
02:21:48,581 --> 02:21:51,910
listen to those because that's kind of 
like having those conversations,

2947
02:21:52,030 --> 02:21:53,620
not in the sense that you're saying the 
words,

2948
02:21:53,890 --> 02:21:56,730
but being privy to a conversation with a
guy like Hitchens,

2949
02:21:56,731 --> 02:21:57,564
like you see sitting there and talking 
with Sam Harris or some a religious 

2950
02:22:00,401 --> 02:22:03,280
leader or something like that in the,
the logical points that he makes,

2951
02:22:03,670 --> 02:22:04,440
it's,
they're,

2952
02:22:04,440 --> 02:22:05,273
they're,
they're very enriching in a way that a 

2953
02:22:06,731 --> 02:22:08,290
lot of times,
like school isn't even,

2954
02:22:08,730 --> 02:22:09,563
a lot of times your professor is a 
fucking incompetent cunt that got that 

2955
02:22:12,611 --> 02:22:14,880
job because he sucked the right decks 
and now he's got tenure.

2956
02:22:15,070 --> 02:22:16,820
Yeah.
There's a lot of those shitty repressors

2957
02:22:16,821 --> 02:22:17,654
man.
Yeah.

2958
02:22:17,720 --> 02:22:18,920
Yeah.
Did a lot of those,

2959
02:22:18,921 --> 02:22:21,320
there's a hitchens video.
Did you see the one where he talks about

2960
02:22:21,321 --> 02:22:25,300
what a monster Saddam Hussein wise and 
you see now and oh yeah,

2961
02:22:25,860 --> 02:22:27,270
his genius.
Yeah,

2962
02:22:27,360 --> 02:22:28,820
and he's right.
You know,

2963
02:22:28,860 --> 02:22:30,360
I,
it was all my arm monster though.

2964
02:22:30,840 --> 02:22:32,370
Saddam Hussein,
he was our monster.

2965
02:22:32,371 --> 02:22:33,500
Sure.
Yeah.

2966
02:22:33,510 --> 02:22:34,530
We,
we helped that guy,

2967
02:22:35,100 --> 02:22:35,933
but his sons are even scarier.
They ever read some of the things that 

2968
02:22:38,161 --> 02:22:40,080
his sons did.
I can't remember.

2969
02:22:40,081 --> 02:22:40,914
I,
his sons were like Ramsay Bolton from 

2970
02:22:41,971 --> 02:22:43,560
the game of thrones.
But for real,

2971
02:22:43,920 --> 02:22:47,520
they fed women to dogs.
They would take a woman,

2972
02:22:47,550 --> 02:22:49,950
they would take her from her bridal 
party,

2973
02:22:50,250 --> 02:22:51,083
raper killer husband or throw her 
husband in jail raper and then feed her 

2974
02:22:55,351 --> 02:22:59,160
to their dogs.
And they did this more than once.

2975
02:23:01,110 --> 02:23:02,460
God Damn,
man.

2976
02:23:02,490 --> 02:23:04,440
Yeah.
Well this is what we're talking about.

2977
02:23:04,441 --> 02:23:06,300
We were talking about like North Korea,
by the way.

2978
02:23:06,330 --> 02:23:08,550
I don't know that this happened.
I wasn't there.

2979
02:23:09,120 --> 02:23:13,200
This is what I heard and this is what he
could read it online.

2980
02:23:13,201 --> 02:23:16,530
That's what everybody has said.
It's pretty much agreed that he did it.

2981
02:23:16,531 --> 02:23:18,660
But I think again,
like I was criticizing you earlier,

2982
02:23:18,661 --> 02:23:21,660
I totally could be completely wrong,
but this guy,

2983
02:23:21,661 --> 02:23:22,494
if they did do it,
I'm pretty sure they did or something 

2984
02:23:23,911 --> 02:23:25,440
like it.
They didn't do awesome stuff.

2985
02:23:25,830 --> 02:23:27,270
That was not that long ago,
man.

2986
02:23:27,900 --> 02:23:30,740
We did some awesome stuff.
You know,

2987
02:23:31,240 --> 02:23:33,120
like I bet it wasn't all feed and girls.

2988
02:23:33,180 --> 02:23:34,013
The dog was,
I bet they were complete total 

2989
02:23:36,240 --> 02:23:39,030
sociopaths and psychopaths from the womb
there.

2990
02:23:39,031 --> 02:23:39,864
Dad was a murderer is dictator.
He raised them and I bet he raised them 

2991
02:23:43,081 --> 02:23:44,580
to be fucking monsters.
No,

2992
02:23:44,610 --> 02:23:46,590
you're ready to romance book.
Who did,

2993
02:23:46,900 --> 02:23:48,360
how many sane jerk off to it?

2994
02:23:48,620 --> 02:23:50,750
I haven't read it yet.
I think they're releasing it soon.

2995
02:23:50,751 --> 02:23:53,050
Look at it and shit like there.
He wrote like a real,

2996
02:23:53,051 --> 02:23:55,970
a romantic piece of fiction.
I mean,

2997
02:23:56,180 --> 02:23:57,013
by the way,
I'm not saying that Hussein or bolt or 

2998
02:23:59,331 --> 02:24:02,440
whatever the fuck is weird day Coosa 
Uday and Qusay work.

2999
02:24:02,870 --> 02:24:07,870
But it is so fucking terrible when you 
realize that even the worst people still

3000
02:24:12,770 --> 02:24:13,603
have something good about them did.
They're isn't a complete monster out 

3001
02:24:17,991 --> 02:24:18,501
there.
Well,

3002
02:24:18,501 --> 02:24:20,750
there's definitely complete monsters.
So happened for sure.

3003
02:24:20,810 --> 02:24:23,720
I think that inside you don't think Ed 
gain,

3004
02:24:24,860 --> 02:24:28,790
the guy used to make lampshades at a 
women's skin do serial killer.

3005
02:24:28,791 --> 02:24:29,624
I think the monster is part of being 
human being is that no matter how 

3006
02:24:35,300 --> 02:24:39,560
fucking awful you are and no matter how 
terrible,

3007
02:24:40,040 --> 02:24:43,310
now this could be completely naive and 
I'm sure there's exceptions,

3008
02:24:43,311 --> 02:24:46,490
but mostly no matter how fucking off who
you are,

3009
02:24:46,880 --> 02:24:51,860
some little piece of you inside of you 
glimmering way down there underneath all

3010
02:24:51,861 --> 02:24:52,694
the fucking violence and murder knows 
that you have the potential to be kind 

3011
02:24:58,760 --> 02:25:02,150
and it tortures you and I think that's 
inside every single person.

3012
02:25:02,360 --> 02:25:05,990
You can feel it in you all the time,
no matter how good or how bad you are.

3013
02:25:06,200 --> 02:25:08,990
There's always that like you want to 
help.

3014
02:25:09,170 --> 02:25:12,980
There's always something in there.
Even fucking Dahmer,

3015
02:25:13,160 --> 02:25:16,250
even the worst of the worst man,
somewhere in there.

3016
02:25:16,460 --> 02:25:18,260
There it's in.
It's in every single person.

3017
02:25:18,380 --> 02:25:23,380
It's what I think it's what we are.
And the more separate you get from it,

3018
02:25:24,100 --> 02:25:26,320
the more you start doing,
you know,

3019
02:25:26,650 --> 02:25:27,483
he would get,
it starts with like not putting your 

3020
02:25:29,441 --> 02:25:31,440
fucking shopping cart away at the 
grocery store.

3021
02:25:31,470 --> 02:25:33,640
The problem was we're talking about 
people that aren't broken.

3022
02:25:34,040 --> 02:25:34,873
They're there.
There's people that through whatever 

3023
02:25:36,311 --> 02:25:37,900
reason,
through nature or nurture,

3024
02:25:38,170 --> 02:25:39,003
there's people that have fuses broken.
Just like there's people that are born 

3025
02:25:40,661 --> 02:25:42,490
with leukemia,
just like some people have cancer,

3026
02:25:42,491 --> 02:25:43,324
just like some people have epilepsy,
just like some people are born with 

3027
02:25:45,800 --> 02:25:46,633
disfigured arms.
Some people's brains are fucking wired 

3028
02:25:49,691 --> 02:25:50,524
wrong from the jump.
There's something wrong biologically 

3029
02:25:52,991 --> 02:25:53,950
with them.
Okay,

3030
02:25:53,951 --> 02:25:54,610
sure.
Right.

3031
02:25:54,610 --> 02:25:55,031
I mean,
don't,

3032
02:25:55,031 --> 02:25:56,080
wouldn't we assume?
Yes,

3033
02:25:56,081 --> 02:25:58,450
I would.
I totally agree that there are people,

3034
02:25:58,451 --> 02:25:59,950
he's fucking,
brains aren't working,

3035
02:26:00,130 --> 02:26:02,140
but I don't think we're just our brains.
No,

3036
02:26:02,141 --> 02:26:03,430
I mean,
I don't think so either,

3037
02:26:03,640 --> 02:26:04,660
but I,
well that's what I'm saying.

3038
02:26:04,720 --> 02:26:06,100
Like it's not an either or.

3039
02:26:06,280 --> 02:26:07,113
It's not a nature or nurture.
It's probably all kinds of stuff going 

3040
02:26:09,611 --> 02:26:10,780
on,
you know?

3041
02:26:10,781 --> 02:26:13,330
I mean,
I think some people are most likely born

3042
02:26:13,331 --> 02:26:15,130
with defective minds.
Right?

3043
02:26:15,160 --> 02:26:15,993
We all agree with that.
There was definitely people that have 

3044
02:26:17,430 --> 02:26:18,400
uh,
challenged,

3045
02:26:18,820 --> 02:26:20,110
uh,
learning disabilities,

3046
02:26:20,111 --> 02:26:20,944
all sorts of issues and a dyslexia.
There's all sort of things that were 

3047
02:26:23,500 --> 02:26:24,333
absolutely aware of.
Well there's got to be for sure some 

3048
02:26:28,181 --> 02:26:29,014
shit that would lead a person to not 
understand when they're causing other 

3049
02:26:31,001 --> 02:26:33,580
people harm or not care or,
or like it,

3050
02:26:34,030 --> 02:26:36,040
this is what I mean,
is it sociopath?

3051
02:26:36,041 --> 02:26:36,930
Right?
See,

3052
02:26:36,940 --> 02:26:41,020
I like to believe that because okay.
And this is,

3053
02:26:41,021 --> 02:26:43,420
you know,
an infinite never ending argument.

3054
02:26:43,900 --> 02:26:47,110
Some people believe humans are meat 
robots.

3055
02:26:47,980 --> 02:26:52,980
Self awareness comes from the sum total 
of all these different processes running

3056
02:26:53,111 --> 02:26:53,944
at once.
And now we have this awareness of this 

3057
02:26:56,271 --> 02:26:57,850
south,
whatever that may be.

3058
02:26:58,210 --> 02:27:03,210
Some people think that there is an 
infinite never ending undying pixel that

3059
02:27:06,220 --> 02:27:11,220
is grow that a human has grown around 
[inaudible] and I think goes on forever.

3060
02:27:11,771 --> 02:27:16,660
And that thing is I'm made of love or 
for lack of a better word,

3061
02:27:16,690 --> 02:27:18,720
it is.
Um,

3062
02:27:19,390 --> 02:27:21,610
right.
So the idea is,

3063
02:27:21,850 --> 02:27:23,680
and I,
I like to believe this idea,

3064
02:27:23,710 --> 02:27:27,970
as crazy as it may sound,
anyone can be redeemed.

3065
02:27:28,150 --> 02:27:32,230
Redemption is possible for all humans 
living today.

3066
02:27:32,410 --> 02:27:33,243
There is a way to stop your forward 
momentum and the direction of 

3067
02:27:36,500 --> 02:27:37,333
selfishness and start moving in the 
direction of being a little bit less of 

3068
02:27:41,081 --> 02:27:41,914
a fucking prick.
I believe maybe people that have the 

3069
02:27:44,381 --> 02:27:45,214
inclination or they have the potential 
to be a psychopath if they were raised 

3070
02:27:49,391 --> 02:27:54,220
by kind and loving people would develop 
patterns of behavior that are consistent

3071
02:27:54,221 --> 02:27:56,410
with civilization and with harmony and 
community.

3072
02:27:56,650 --> 02:27:57,483
Like maybe what you get when you get a 
psychopath is the combination of really 

3073
02:28:01,271 --> 02:28:03,160
shitty upbringing,
child abuse,

3074
02:28:03,370 --> 02:28:06,720
all sorts of awful verbal and emotional 
shit that happens.

3075
02:28:06,740 --> 02:28:10,150
People in physical shit that happens to 
people in the young and these traits.

3076
02:28:10,210 --> 02:28:11,043
Yeah,
and also maybe maybe some of those 

3077
02:28:12,821 --> 02:28:16,930
traits are triggered by genes expressing
themselves and time of great duress.

3078
02:28:17,040 --> 02:28:17,873
Yeah,
which is one of the things that I was 

3079
02:28:18,121 --> 02:28:20,260
talking about that I forgot earlier.
I started on it,

3080
02:28:20,261 --> 02:28:21,980
but I never finished.
It was talking about the

3081
02:28:21,980 --> 02:28:25,280
people that came over on these boats.
They're their gut biome.

3082
02:28:25,520 --> 02:28:26,353
If we're talking about someone who is on
a boat for 60 days eating fucking beef 

3083
02:28:31,101 --> 02:28:33,530
jerky and they come over here with 
scurvy,

3084
02:28:33,740 --> 02:28:36,680
they're desperate.
They're fucking body's eating itself.

3085
02:28:36,890 --> 02:28:38,640
I mean,
literally their body's eating itself.

3086
02:28:38,780 --> 02:28:39,550
Yeah,
you're,

3087
02:28:39,550 --> 02:28:41,870
you're,
your bones are fucking weak.

3088
02:28:42,470 --> 02:28:43,303
Your lack of vitamin C is causing you to
get ill and then you land on this beach 

3089
02:28:48,380 --> 02:28:53,120
and you're in an insane desperation mode
and you already a piece of shit.

3090
02:28:53,280 --> 02:28:55,400
Her height,
you're already a monster.

3091
02:28:55,550 --> 02:29:00,550
He already some monster from Europe and 
you come over here with a fucking a free

3092
02:29:01,101 --> 02:29:03,080
past to wreak havoc.
These aren't even,

3093
02:29:03,081 --> 02:29:05,600
people look to Brown then don't look 
anything like,

3094
02:29:05,601 --> 02:29:07,130
all right,
they get us gold.

3095
02:29:07,280 --> 02:29:08,210
Hey,
get that gold.

3096
02:29:08,240 --> 02:29:09,290
How do I,
how do you want me to get it?

3097
02:29:09,550 --> 02:29:10,460
Any way you can get it.

3098
02:29:10,850 --> 02:29:12,500
Okay.
I'm just cut that dude's arm off till he

3099
02:29:12,501 --> 02:29:13,540
gives me gold.
Right?

3100
02:29:13,570 --> 02:29:14,600
I mean,
what,

3101
02:29:15,230 --> 02:29:17,930
this is all what we know happened,
right?

3102
02:29:17,960 --> 02:29:19,970
Yeah.
When you're starving,

3103
02:29:20,240 --> 02:29:22,580
I wonder if you really are a different 
person.

3104
02:29:22,820 --> 02:29:24,200
Like when you hear about people like 
the,

3105
02:29:24,201 --> 02:29:25,600
um,
the people that came over on the,

3106
02:29:25,601 --> 02:29:26,434
the pass in Colorado,
the Donner party won a beat and each 

3107
02:29:29,421 --> 02:29:30,254
other,
cause they fucking froze to death out 

3108
02:29:31,881 --> 02:29:32,714
there and they,
they didn't know what to do and there 

3109
02:29:33,891 --> 02:29:35,660
was no foods.
They just started hating each other.

3110
02:29:36,200 --> 02:29:37,033
Like what?
What is the switch that goes off like w 

3111
02:29:38,950 --> 02:29:41,810
who are you when that happened?
So you even the same person,

3112
02:29:41,980 --> 02:29:43,520
right?
If you really are,

3113
02:29:43,521 --> 02:29:48,050
if your personality consists of this 
ecosystem that we call your body,

3114
02:29:48,200 --> 02:29:51,830
which we know for a fact has all sorts 
of different stuff that's going on.

3115
02:29:52,070 --> 02:29:55,340
There's different stuff on your skin,
there's different stuff in your body,

3116
02:29:55,640 --> 02:30:00,640
there's all sorts of different bacteria 
that it coexists with you and even exist

3117
02:30:00,801 --> 02:30:02,270
in a symbiotic way,
right?

3118
02:30:02,420 --> 02:30:05,510
Like you need all these things inside 
your body to consume the food.

3119
02:30:05,690 --> 02:30:07,460
Like it's part of your digestive system,
right?

3120
02:30:07,461 --> 02:30:10,550
He Kolai is a natural part of the human 
digestive tract,

3121
02:30:10,551 --> 02:30:11,384
right?
It's all in there.

3122
02:30:12,430 --> 02:30:13,370
What,
what,

3123
02:30:13,760 --> 02:30:15,620
what are you,
when you're starving,

3124
02:30:16,260 --> 02:30:18,890
are you,
will you like some crazy wolf person?

3125
02:30:19,040 --> 02:30:20,300
Like,
what does a person like?

3126
02:30:20,301 --> 02:30:21,020
I mean,
what are they,

3127
02:30:21,020 --> 02:30:21,853
how,
how scary is someone when they're a day 

3128
02:30:24,141 --> 02:30:26,420
from starving to death and they have a 
knife?

3129
02:30:27,570 --> 02:30:28,140
Well,
man,

3130
02:30:28,140 --> 02:30:32,400
I mean this is the question of freewill 
versus no free.

3131
02:30:32,401 --> 02:30:33,234
Well,
you're saying if you get in a stressful 

3132
02:30:34,831 --> 02:30:35,664
situation,
does some kind of mechanism of the 

3133
02:30:39,120 --> 02:30:44,100
swarms of organisms that make up 
yourself kick in where you no longer are

3134
02:30:44,101 --> 02:30:46,350
capable of making decisions?
I mean,

3135
02:30:46,351 --> 02:30:48,750
do you even you,
you absolutely.

3136
02:30:48,751 --> 02:30:51,900
I it,
I don't think it ever goes away.

3137
02:30:52,140 --> 02:30:57,140
And I think that you always have this 
weird autonomy that the universal try to

3138
02:30:59,431 --> 02:31:04,170
trick you into thinking isn't there and 
then suddenly you become a,

3139
02:31:04,171 --> 02:31:06,000
um,
now of course though,

3140
02:31:06,270 --> 02:31:08,010
I think if you look at the,
uh,

3141
02:31:08,370 --> 02:31:09,203
judicial system,
there is a form of murder where you 

3142
02:31:12,241 --> 02:31:13,074
don't,
a temporary insanity is what they call 

3143
02:31:15,271 --> 02:31:15,601
it,
right?

3144
02:31:15,601 --> 02:31:16,560
Yeah.
So,

3145
02:31:16,830 --> 02:31:20,190
you know,
there's like people who have lost

3146
02:31:20,190 --> 02:31:22,050
their fucking mind and stabbed someone 
to death,

3147
02:31:22,300 --> 02:31:24,750
they prove that in court.
And then in that case,

3148
02:31:24,751 --> 02:31:25,584
you don't even go to jail.
You've killed someone because you a 

3149
02:31:27,370 --> 02:31:31,080
temporarily fucking insane.
But I don't know man.

3150
02:31:31,081 --> 02:31:36,030
I think that mostly,
mostly if you really watch yourself,

3151
02:31:36,360 --> 02:31:39,390
you realize that you're,
you're pretty much in control man.

3152
02:31:39,391 --> 02:31:44,130
Like your,
when I watch myself when I'm about to be

3153
02:31:44,131 --> 02:31:44,964
an asshole,
like if I'm about to do something cause 

3154
02:31:46,531 --> 02:31:47,364
I'm hangry as they call it,
you're talking about the ultimate 

3155
02:31:49,561 --> 02:31:50,394
version of hangry,
which is where your result to 

3156
02:31:51,751 --> 02:31:53,340
capitalism,
hungry and tired,

3157
02:31:53,650 --> 02:31:54,570
angry,
hangry,

3158
02:31:54,600 --> 02:31:56,430
hungry and angry.
Hungry and angry.

3159
02:31:56,580 --> 02:31:57,750
So like,
uh,

3160
02:31:57,780 --> 02:32:02,720
yeah,
it's a good tired that's hired but,

3161
02:32:02,950 --> 02:32:07,950
but that's higher than a shitty job but,
but uh,

3162
02:32:08,070 --> 02:32:08,903
so,
but if you look at yourself even in 

3163
02:32:10,231 --> 02:32:11,064
that,
when you're having like by a chemical 

3164
02:32:12,180 --> 02:32:13,013
shit going down and you're about to say 
something nasty to somebody usual or do 

3165
02:32:17,281 --> 02:32:19,380
something nasty,
usually you're old,

3166
02:32:19,440 --> 02:32:20,273
you're like,
ah,

3167
02:32:20,310 --> 02:32:21,740
I'm about to,
um,

3168
02:32:22,110 --> 02:32:23,960
like do I give it into this horrible 
impulse?

3169
02:32:23,970 --> 02:32:26,940
Yes.
Do I just shit all just open my ass hole

3170
02:32:26,941 --> 02:32:27,780
up and spray?

3171
02:32:27,860 --> 02:32:28,840
Yes.
Yeah,

3172
02:32:28,960 --> 02:32:29,481
yeah,
I do.

3173
02:32:29,481 --> 02:32:30,690
I do it.
And then you do it,

3174
02:32:30,980 --> 02:32:32,100
then you do it.
You say,

3175
02:32:32,101 --> 02:32:33,830
you know what,
I'm going to fucking spray.

3176
02:32:34,070 --> 02:32:37,540
And it's,
it's just like coming to,

3177
02:32:37,670 --> 02:32:39,950
it was just like coming,
cause it's like when you're about to see

3178
02:32:39,980 --> 02:32:43,070
if you want this thing,
when you watch yourself about to have an

3179
02:32:43,071 --> 02:32:43,940
orgasm,
right?

3180
02:32:44,420 --> 02:32:46,850
And you watch it build and build and 
build and build,

3181
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:47,833
and eventually it gets to a point where 
you're going to decide to come or you 

3182
02:32:50,481 --> 02:32:52,910
can't control.
It may be and you're gonna fucking come,

3183
02:32:53,120 --> 02:32:55,460
but you can watch it build and build and
build.

3184
02:32:55,461 --> 02:32:56,294
But then when you come,
the orgasm is like a mild seizure of 

3185
02:32:58,851 --> 02:33:01,130
joy.
Your body goes through these like,

3186
02:33:01,920 --> 02:33:02,753
ah,
there's a coal by though your entire 

3187
02:33:05,601 --> 02:33:06,950
body as a reaction,
right?

3188
02:33:07,040 --> 02:33:09,620
So in the same way,
when you start getting angry,

3189
02:33:10,430 --> 02:33:12,560
it's just like when you're fucking about
to come,

3190
02:33:12,561 --> 02:33:14,420
it's building and building and building.

3191
02:33:14,630 --> 02:33:15,650
And then you're like,
you know what?

3192
02:33:16,850 --> 02:33:20,240
I'm going to fucking tell this person 
how I really fucking feel to day.

3193
02:33:20,420 --> 02:33:25,420
But you're angry and then woof,
all this weird seizure shit happens.

3194
02:33:26,060 --> 02:33:28,550
Stuff comes out of your mouth that you 
don't even mean.

3195
02:33:28,760 --> 02:33:30,890
It's like half real half.
Not Real.

3196
02:33:31,040 --> 02:33:32,780
So,
but you decide,

3197
02:33:33,020 --> 02:33:33,853
you decide when to squeeze the trigger.
It's not something that you don't have 

3198
02:33:38,271 --> 02:33:40,790
control of,
at least mostly.

3199
02:33:41,360 --> 02:33:46,360
And people who fool themselves into 
thinking that they don't have control,

3200
02:33:46,790 --> 02:33:47,623
those are the ones who I think relegate 
themselves into the world of being some 

3201
02:33:52,041 --> 02:33:55,930
kind of machine,
some kind of like victimy machine.

3202
02:33:56,300 --> 02:33:56,930
I,
right.

3203
02:33:56,930 --> 02:33:57,763
But you know,
that's not really the free will 

3204
02:33:58,881 --> 02:33:59,481
argument.
Right.

3205
02:33:59,481 --> 02:34:01,250
You know,
the full free provable argument,

3206
02:34:01,251 --> 02:34:03,120
right?
I know some freewill arguments.

3207
02:34:03,400 --> 02:34:06,920
I get the most compelling one.
That determinism one w what's compelling

3208
02:34:06,921 --> 02:34:10,850
about it is that it doesn't exonerate 
you from your decisions,

3209
02:34:11,090 --> 02:34:11,923
but what it does say is essentially to 
think that you are somehow another 

3210
02:34:16,070 --> 02:34:17,980
separate from the influence of

3211
02:34:17,980 --> 02:34:18,813
your life and that the influence of your
life hasn't in some way influenced the 

3212
02:34:23,411 --> 02:34:28,411
way you decide to act and behave.
And that a lot of those factors that led

3213
02:34:28,631 --> 02:34:31,540
you influencing the way you act and 
behave,

3214
02:34:31,541 --> 02:34:32,480
what led to you,
uh,

3215
02:34:32,590 --> 02:34:33,423
changing the way you act to behave are 
completely out of your control and I'm 

3216
02:34:36,491 --> 02:34:37,324
almost unavoidable in their impact and 
that these things shape you in some in 

3217
02:34:43,141 --> 02:34:46,900
measurable way that you'll never be 
completely autonomous from.

3218
02:34:47,140 --> 02:34:47,973
You'll never be able to completely 
separate yourself from the influence of 

3219
02:34:50,021 --> 02:34:50,854
your genetics,
of your life experiences of your 

3220
02:34:52,541 --> 02:34:53,374
neighborhood,
of your mom or your dad or your 

3221
02:34:54,041 --> 02:34:54,874
upbringing,
the Dell velop mental period where you 

3222
02:34:57,041 --> 02:34:57,874
may or may not have been ignored or 
abused or all those factors play a part 

3223
02:35:01,301 --> 02:35:02,134
in how you decide to behave and even how
you decide to deal with how you decide 

3224
02:35:06,441 --> 02:35:10,150
to behave your own therapy.
Like if you decided,

3225
02:35:10,151 --> 02:35:10,984
hey man,
I'm tired of jizzing all over people 

3226
02:35:12,101 --> 02:35:14,980
with my asshole.
Every time I buy temperature boils up,

3227
02:35:14,981 --> 02:35:15,814
at the end of the day I'm going to 
figure out how to not come home from a 

3228
02:35:18,221 --> 02:35:20,650
hard day's work at the factory and beat 
my wife.

3229
02:35:21,100 --> 02:35:21,933
Like,
even that is potentially determined by 

3230
02:35:24,881 --> 02:35:25,714
your past and not really,
you having free will decide not to be a 

3231
02:35:28,421 --> 02:35:28,950
piece of shit.

3232
02:35:28,950 --> 02:35:29,783
Oh,
okay.

3233
02:35:29,800 --> 02:35:31,150
Right.
So the,

3234
02:35:31,440 --> 02:35:32,273
okay,
so

3235
02:35:32,630 --> 02:35:34,790
not my theory,
this is a,

3236
02:35:34,800 --> 02:35:35,633
this is more of a shitty explanation of 
what some people have argued and Harris 

3237
02:35:40,521 --> 02:35:44,480
argued it on the podcast or I wouldn't 
say he's argued it.

3238
02:35:44,481 --> 02:35:45,260
He,
um,

3239
02:35:45,260 --> 02:35:48,730
I would say that he explained it in a 
very interesting way.

3240
02:35:48,790 --> 02:35:49,623
It's compelling and you have to think 
about it and take it into consideration 

3241
02:35:51,681 --> 02:35:53,240
when you use terms like free will.

3242
02:35:53,290 --> 02:35:54,280
Well,
I would,

3243
02:35:54,490 --> 02:35:55,323
I mean,
so it gets down to this point of 

3244
02:35:57,760 --> 02:35:59,020
decision,
right?

3245
02:35:59,021 --> 02:36:02,800
So when I look at like a lot of the 
decisions that I make,

3246
02:36:03,280 --> 02:36:05,710
uh,
they're spontaneous and they're not,

3247
02:36:05,890 --> 02:36:10,660
I'm not sitting around thinking like,
how am I gonna turn my steering wheel at

3248
02:36:10,661 --> 02:36:11,494
this moment as I'm on the interstate?
What mild adjustments am I going to 

3249
02:36:14,291 --> 02:36:15,124
make?
This is all just to kind of spontaneous 

3250
02:36:17,291 --> 02:36:20,350
thing that seems to be part of 
autopilot.

3251
02:36:20,351 --> 02:36:25,090
And I know a lot of people are running 
on autopilot in most of what they do,

3252
02:36:26,020 --> 02:36:28,360
but I still don't think that it,
it,

3253
02:36:28,660 --> 02:36:31,600
it negates free will.
It's like a,

3254
02:36:31,930 --> 02:36:36,930
you could think of your life as a boat 
and everyone's in a different shape boat

3255
02:36:37,120 --> 02:36:40,450
and the boat's been shaped by 
experience.

3256
02:36:40,451 --> 02:36:42,580
Genetics,
gender.

3257
02:36:42,740 --> 02:36:45,300
Oh,
he's from my envision.

3258
02:36:45,310 --> 02:36:47,650
What kind of boat them?
What kind of vote of Mayan?

3259
02:36:47,830 --> 02:36:48,663
Yeah.
What kind of boat?

3260
02:36:49,550 --> 02:36:54,220
My boat has to,
has a fucking graying beard and one ball

3261
02:36:54,221 --> 02:36:55,054
brother.

3262
02:36:58,160 --> 02:37:02,050
He's tried to picture a fishing boat or 
we in a cruise liner,

3263
02:37:02,051 --> 02:37:05,320
like let's just say it's a fucking for a
lot of people at ain't and cruise liner,

3264
02:37:05,340 --> 02:37:06,730
right?
For a lot of people.

3265
02:37:06,731 --> 02:37:07,564
It's a raft that's built of different 
things that they've decided to grab out 

3266
02:37:11,441 --> 02:37:12,274
of the infinite world of phenomena and 
hammered together to some kind of 

3267
02:37:16,310 --> 02:37:17,143
vessel,
which is their reality tunnel that 

3268
02:37:19,281 --> 02:37:22,430
they're living in and they're navigating
this fucking raft.

3269
02:37:22,460 --> 02:37:24,440
And so sure,
some people,

3270
02:37:24,560 --> 02:37:25,393
they might have a boat that is a little 
more cumbersome and a little more 

3271
02:37:28,131 --> 02:37:33,131
difficult to navigate through the 
neverending string of decisions that you

3272
02:37:33,171 --> 02:37:36,230
have to make if you exist inside of 
time.

3273
02:37:36,500 --> 02:37:40,430
But still you can,
there's parts of that boat,

3274
02:37:40,431 --> 02:37:41,630
I guarantee it,
man.

3275
02:37:41,810 --> 02:37:44,510
There's parts of your boat that you can 
revise.

3276
02:37:44,511 --> 02:37:45,950
You might not be able to change at all.

3277
02:37:46,220 --> 02:37:49,100
You're probably not gonna be able to 
change your skin color.

3278
02:37:49,101 --> 02:37:50,930
You're not going to be able to change 
your yet.

3279
02:37:51,170 --> 02:37:54,500
People are certainly changing the gender
of their fucking boats.

3280
02:37:54,501 --> 02:37:56,330
You know,
people are doing that right now.

3281
02:37:56,331 --> 02:37:59,270
And I think is technology continues to 
advance.

3282
02:37:59,750 --> 02:38:01,580
Uh,
we're going to find that we're more like

3283
02:38:01,581 --> 02:38:02,414
crispr.
I think we're going to find we're more 

3284
02:38:03,471 --> 02:38:04,304
and more able to like actually change 
the structure of our boats according to 

3285
02:38:08,331 --> 02:38:09,164
our desire,
but if you really analyze what's going 

3286
02:38:12,171 --> 02:38:13,004
on in your life,
you will see that you are actively 

3287
02:38:15,711 --> 02:38:16,544
making decisions from moment to moment 
that are [inaudible] and who's making 

3288
02:38:20,661 --> 02:38:21,740
the decision?
Well,

3289
02:38:21,741 --> 02:38:23,390
I don't know.
Well that's where it gets weird,

3290
02:38:23,391 --> 02:38:25,430
right?
If you want to say it's your gut biome,

3291
02:38:25,610 --> 02:38:29,810
if you want to say it's the ind of a 
never ending series of decisions made by

3292
02:38:29,811 --> 02:38:31,560
never an extreme of,
wait a minute,

3293
02:38:31,660 --> 02:38:35,170
why does it have to be either or?
Isn't it all these things?

3294
02:38:35,260 --> 02:38:36,093
I mean that I think that's where the 
argument gets really weird because I 

3295
02:38:37,841 --> 02:38:39,520
think it's all these things.
Yeah,

3296
02:38:39,730 --> 02:38:40,563
it's life experiences and it's genetics 
and it's choices and it's consciousness 

3297
02:38:44,800 --> 02:38:45,633
and it's the willful expression of 
positive ideas and forcing them on your 

3298
02:38:50,471 --> 02:38:52,390
life and what is the motivation behind 
that?

3299
02:38:52,600 --> 02:38:54,760
Is that your past?
Is it what you've learned?

3300
02:38:54,761 --> 02:38:57,760
Is it a fucking inspirational youtube 
video you watched this afternoon?

3301
02:38:57,810 --> 02:38:58,643
Yeah.
Who Cares?

3302
02:38:58,840 --> 02:39:00,430
Whatever it is.
It's a bunch of shit.

3303
02:39:00,490 --> 02:39:02,590
It's a bunch of shit going on all over 
the place.

3304
02:39:02,591 --> 02:39:03,424
And I think the idea of separating that 
is akin to the idea of separating us 

3305
02:39:08,111 --> 02:39:10,540
from all of the life that's on this 
planet.

3306
02:39:10,990 --> 02:39:14,500
I think we've done a weird thing with 
houses and clothes and cars.

3307
02:39:14,770 --> 02:39:17,830
We've done a weird thing where we're not
touching the world anymore.

3308
02:39:18,070 --> 02:39:21,460
We're not touching it with our feet.
We're not touching it with our skin.

3309
02:39:21,670 --> 02:39:25,030
We're allergic to a bunch of shit.
We can't get anything on us.

3310
02:39:25,090 --> 02:39:26,920
We can't go anywhere near a certain 
animals.

3311
02:39:26,921 --> 02:39:29,410
If they touch your skin,
you get hives there.

3312
02:39:29,411 --> 02:39:33,580
There's a bunch of stuff that we've done
in separating ourselves from the natural

3313
02:39:33,581 --> 02:39:36,220
world.
It's left us really fucking confused,

3314
02:39:36,430 --> 02:39:37,263
and I think one of those confusions lies
in when we've created civilizations and 

3315
02:39:40,781 --> 02:39:43,780
cities,
we've lost our contact,

3316
02:39:43,781 --> 02:39:47,050
our physical contact.
We don't have a physical contact.

3317
02:39:47,051 --> 02:39:47,884
The physical contact in nature is all 
playing through the bottom of your 

3318
02:39:50,201 --> 02:39:51,310
boots.
Uh,

3319
02:39:51,311 --> 02:39:54,220
you're breathing it in.
Still do occasionally touch it.

3320
02:39:54,221 --> 02:39:55,054
Yeah.
You occasionally brush up against a 

3321
02:39:55,841 --> 02:39:58,930
tree,
but whatever influence these things have

3322
02:39:58,931 --> 02:39:59,764
through each other and this insane 
network interwoven root systems and 

3323
02:40:05,651 --> 02:40:06,484
mycelium and fungus and rotting leaves 
and animals all around you and all that 

3324
02:40:14,140 --> 02:40:16,200
you,
you get through a filter now,

3325
02:40:16,500 --> 02:40:18,300
all that stuff you get through your car 
window,

3326
02:40:18,510 --> 02:40:20,850
all that stuff you get through your 
clothes has share.

3327
02:40:21,080 --> 02:40:21,913
You don't,
you're not in contact with that stuff 

3328
02:40:22,921 --> 02:40:25,860
anymore and by not being in contact with
it,

3329
02:40:25,861 --> 02:40:29,400
you forget that it has a message.
Like when you,

3330
02:40:29,460 --> 02:40:31,560
when you lay in the grass,
just lay in the grudge,

3331
02:40:31,561 --> 02:40:34,110
just go somewhere and lay in the grass.
It feels good.

3332
02:40:34,650 --> 02:40:37,830
It actually feels like the planet is 
like,

3333
02:40:37,950 --> 02:40:39,480
like hug,
like you're hugging someone.

3334
02:40:39,600 --> 02:40:41,700
When you hug someone it feels good.
Sure.

3335
02:40:41,790 --> 02:40:44,220
It feels good to lay in a nice long as 
no bugs.

3336
02:40:44,820 --> 02:40:45,653
Conti fucking hands went crawl up your 
ass holes good to temporary lane if you 

3337
02:40:48,901 --> 02:40:49,734
don't ask,
you don't lay down in a fire ant hive 

3338
02:40:51,450 --> 02:40:55,230
and get fucked up by a bunch of bees or 
bees by a bunch of bugs.

3339
02:40:55,590 --> 02:40:58,800
But I think that if you go into nature 
on a daily basis,

3340
02:40:58,801 --> 02:40:59,634
like there was something that I,
I I read the other day that I tweeted 

3341
02:41:02,160 --> 02:41:04,560
about them the some,
I forget who the,

3342
02:41:04,590 --> 02:41:05,423
what the university was,
but they were literally saying that 

3343
02:41:07,351 --> 02:41:12,210
there is an argument that a certain 
amount of nature is like a,

3344
02:41:12,211 --> 02:41:14,010
like a vitamin antidepressant.

3345
02:41:14,030 --> 02:41:14,863
Yeah.
Well like you get vitamin D from the 

3346
02:41:15,811 --> 02:41:16,500
sun.
Yeah.

3347
02:41:16,500 --> 02:41:17,333
There's a certain amount of vitality.
There's a certain amount of positive 

3348
02:41:22,410 --> 02:41:26,070
like life force that you get from being 
in nature.

3349
02:41:26,100 --> 02:41:27,360
Makes sense man.
I mean,

3350
02:41:27,361 --> 02:41:29,400
I know that makes sense.
Whenever I go out,

3351
02:41:29,430 --> 02:41:30,263
I mean just like anything,
just like I got plants now that I have 

3352
02:41:32,581 --> 02:41:34,470
to water.
It was another thing I was going to talk

3353
02:41:34,471 --> 02:41:35,790
to you about.
What I was going to ask you.

3354
02:41:36,150 --> 02:41:39,060
Do you think if these,
if these scientists are correct,

3355
02:41:39,090 --> 02:41:43,260
obviously they are about this 
interconnection between plants and about

3356
02:41:43,261 --> 02:41:47,220
how they communicate with each other and
about how the even allocate resources to

3357
02:41:47,221 --> 02:41:49,920
those that are in need.
Is it fucked up to keep plants?

3358
02:41:50,460 --> 02:41:53,100
Is it fucked up to keep something that 
you decide?

3359
02:41:53,101 --> 02:41:54,360
No,
you're going to leave in this box,

3360
02:41:54,361 --> 02:41:55,194
man.
You're going to live in this box right 

3361
02:41:56,311 --> 02:41:56,880
here.

3362
02:41:56,880 --> 02:41:57,713
Ooh,
it's round.

3363
02:41:57,750 --> 02:42:01,470
Just keep looking for the outside.
Keeps spinning around.

3364
02:42:02,560 --> 02:42:03,393
You know you're not going to communicate
with anybody else because there isn't 

3365
02:42:04,831 --> 02:42:06,750
anybody else.
It's just you.

3366
02:42:07,020 --> 02:42:10,200
It's just you lonely and fucked up 
sitting in this pot.

3367
02:42:10,470 --> 02:42:11,303
Or can they communicate through the air?
Are they communicating through the air 

3368
02:42:13,411 --> 02:42:15,090
and if it does it get through your 
windows?

3369
02:42:15,300 --> 02:42:16,830
Man,
I got 7,000

3370
02:42:16,831 --> 02:42:18,210
things.
I got to feel bad about it.

3371
02:42:18,220 --> 02:42:20,940
The form of fucking house plants land 
there.

3372
02:42:21,930 --> 02:42:24,390
But should you have plants in your house
in a pot?

3373
02:42:24,690 --> 02:42:26,100
Should they all be outside?
I mean,

3374
02:42:26,101 --> 02:42:28,620
if they're outside with their friends,
no problem.

3375
02:42:28,621 --> 02:42:29,930
Right?
If they're outside you,

3376
02:42:29,940 --> 02:42:30,773
you got a yard and you dig a hole and 
you put your plants in there and you 

3377
02:42:33,480 --> 02:42:36,480
water it and it's gross and it's a part 
of the whole system.

3378
02:42:36,570 --> 02:42:37,950
That's like a dog with a yard.

3379
02:42:38,160 --> 02:42:38,993
Otherwise you're,
you got a German shepherd and you keep 

3380
02:42:40,111 --> 02:42:42,180
him in a fucking little con tiny 
kitchen.

3381
02:42:42,300 --> 02:42:45,060
Do you haven't got him pinned in there?
Do you ever do the thing where you start

3382
02:42:45,061 --> 02:42:48,930
thinking about how funny the concept of 
inside and outside is?

3383
02:42:49,290 --> 02:42:51,780
You ever do that?
It's still funny cause it's like,

3384
02:42:51,810 --> 02:42:55,860
okay,
in my house I'm now inside.

3385
02:42:56,220 --> 02:42:59,640
Even though there's just like a layer of
wood around me,

3386
02:42:59,820 --> 02:43:02,790
I'm in some other place that's different
than the outside.

3387
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:04,500
Even though you know you're,
you're really,

3388
02:43:04,860 --> 02:43:07,920
there is no such thing as 10 side.
I'll do you one better.

3389
02:43:08,340 --> 02:43:09,480
How about,
how about this?

3390
02:43:09,540 --> 02:43:12,400
How about the phrase the great outdoors?
All right.

3391
02:43:12,460 --> 02:43:16,150
What you mean reality?
You mean the earth itself?

3392
02:43:16,151 --> 02:43:20,920
Like it is odd to be an enthusiast of 
the world itself.

3393
02:43:21,490 --> 02:43:22,323
We spend so much time in these 
artificially created environments with 

3394
02:43:26,200 --> 02:43:29,860
air conditioning and neon light.
Is it neon?

3395
02:43:30,220 --> 02:43:33,190
Depends.
Lcd Lights these days.

3396
02:43:33,400 --> 02:43:35,890
I think this is not lcd though.
Fluorescent,

3397
02:43:35,891 --> 02:43:36,790
right.
That's what I'm looking for.

3398
02:43:36,850 --> 02:43:40,360
Neon neons like cigars.
Yeah.

3399
02:43:41,460 --> 02:43:42,293
Um,
but these artificial environments that 

3400
02:43:43,801 --> 02:43:44,634
we create,
we're in them way more than we are the 

3401
02:43:46,871 --> 02:43:49,390
outside.
So when we're actually in the outdoors,

3402
02:43:49,480 --> 02:43:51,310
we can call ourselves,
I'm an outdoorsman.

3403
02:43:51,950 --> 02:43:54,250
What do you like to do?
I like to the great outdoors.

3404
02:43:54,640 --> 02:43:55,510
That's what I like,
Bro.

3405
02:43:55,530 --> 02:43:57,340
Sure.
I like to be in the great outdoors.

3406
02:43:57,370 --> 02:43:59,440
Yeah,
great outdoors is,

3407
02:43:59,500 --> 02:44:04,500
instead of saying the world nature,
I'm a nature enthusia.

3408
02:44:05,110 --> 02:44:07,480
I love nature in all its forms,
man,

3409
02:44:07,481 --> 02:44:10,330
including houses,
virtual reality,

3410
02:44:10,630 --> 02:44:12,940
not,
not just being in a fucking house,

3411
02:44:12,941 --> 02:44:16,570
Joe,
but being inside another universe inside

3412
02:44:16,571 --> 02:44:20,560
the house.
That is what I like and it's,

3413
02:44:20,561 --> 02:44:23,560
and also guess what?
Because a lot of anti vr people,

3414
02:44:23,561 --> 02:44:24,660
they're like,
whenever I got out,

3415
02:44:25,030 --> 02:44:26,950
y'all forget about outside.
No,

3416
02:44:27,130 --> 02:44:29,800
I go outside,
enjoy the sun,

3417
02:44:29,980 --> 02:44:34,980
enjoy my shitty little garden with a 
speaking of fucking cruelty to plants,

3418
02:44:35,470 --> 02:44:40,210
God forbid you become one of my plans.
God forbid,

3419
02:44:40,510 --> 02:44:41,343
may you never be one of my plants,
but I still go out there and I try to 

3420
02:44:44,201 --> 02:44:45,490
keep them alive.
But man,

3421
02:44:45,880 --> 02:44:50,880
Vr is such a beautiful thing because it 
creates that same,

3422
02:44:53,290 --> 02:44:56,980
almost the same sense of like,
you know like when you go in a big space

3423
02:44:57,070 --> 02:44:59,110
and it feels good.
I don't know why,

3424
02:44:59,230 --> 02:45:01,270
but you aware it can be a shitty 
warehouse,

3425
02:45:01,271 --> 02:45:05,050
but if it's big,
if you go into like an expansive plane,

3426
02:45:05,210 --> 02:45:07,600
they're like,
that's why it was good.

3427
02:45:07,850 --> 02:45:08,683
I put a is up from the Vatican,
there was in the Vatican last week or 

3428
02:45:11,091 --> 02:45:11,924
two weeks ago and I went to St Peter's 
basilica and I put a bunch of photos of 

3429
02:45:14,361 --> 02:45:16,340
it on my instagram feed.
If you ever been to the Vatican,

3430
02:45:16,580 --> 02:45:17,750
not yet.
You got to go.

3431
02:45:17,900 --> 02:45:20,210
First of all,
it is trippy psychedelic.

3432
02:45:20,211 --> 02:45:22,520
There's a giant pine cone.
Okay.

3433
02:45:22,521 --> 02:45:25,370
They have this huge courtyard with a 
huge pine cone,

3434
02:45:25,371 --> 02:45:26,204
which represents the pineal gland and 
these two peacocks that represent 

3435
02:45:29,540 --> 02:45:31,130
eternal life.
He cocks.

3436
02:45:31,131 --> 02:45:32,930
Apparently that's,
I took that photo.

3437
02:45:33,560 --> 02:45:34,700
Um,
the,

3438
02:45:34,701 --> 02:45:35,534
uh,
the guide was super psyched when I knew 

3439
02:45:37,181 --> 02:45:40,610
at the pine cone,
met his eyes lit up and I say represents

3440
02:45:40,611 --> 02:45:41,690
the pineal gland,
right?

3441
02:45:41,691 --> 02:45:42,860
And he's like,
how do you know that?

3442
02:45:43,130 --> 02:45:47,480
And then we started talking about 
Christianity and its potential routes in

3443
02:45:47,481 --> 02:45:52,130
psychedelic drugs and ancient Roman 
culture and how,

3444
02:45:52,340 --> 02:45:54,350
you know,
like the John Marco Allegro book,

3445
02:45:54,351 --> 02:45:55,184
the sacred mushroom and the scroll where
he thought that what Christianity was 

3446
02:45:58,371 --> 02:45:59,204
initially was a bunch of stories where 
they hid the psychedelic rituals in 

3447
02:46:02,480 --> 02:46:03,313
parables and stories to hit it from the 
Romans because when they were being 

3448
02:46:06,741 --> 02:46:10,790
conquered by the Romans,
they didn't them to know how magical the

3449
02:46:10,791 --> 02:46:11,624
mushrooms were and they were a 
connection to God and that the pineal 

3450
02:46:14,181 --> 02:46:15,014
gland,
like I forget the actual chemical 

3451
02:46:17,391 --> 02:46:20,210
composition of DMT,
but or not the,

3452
02:46:20,450 --> 02:46:21,560
uh,
not dmt rather,

3453
02:46:21,561 --> 02:46:22,394
but mushrooms.

3454
02:46:22,400 --> 02:46:26,330
But what DMT is diamond,
the tryptamine is in some form.

3455
02:46:26,510 --> 02:46:30,650
That's what happens to psychedelic 
mushrooms when you taken psilocybin.

3456
02:46:31,100 --> 02:46:33,440
I think it's,
I think it's like for Fox,

3457
02:46:33,441 --> 02:46:35,830
for a [inaudible],
and I know I'm butchering it and,

3458
02:46:35,831 --> 02:46:36,664
and dimethyl trip to me,
but it's some version of 

3459
02:46:38,841 --> 02:46:43,841
dimethyltryptamine is produced when you 
consume psilocybin mushrooms.

3460
02:46:44,120 --> 02:46:47,300
So these guys knew that,
they knew that.

3461
02:46:47,301 --> 02:46:48,134
And then it was a part of their art and 
it represented that pineal gland is 

3462
02:46:51,681 --> 02:46:52,514
giant fucking 15 foot tall pine cone 
represented what they thought was the 

3463
02:46:58,131 --> 02:46:58,964
seat of the soul.
That's why it's sitting there and this 

3464
02:47:00,411 --> 02:47:01,244
fucking,
this gigantic tray being held up by 

3465
02:47:03,411 --> 02:47:07,010
angels and Shit and whoever those saints
see to this sill.

3466
02:47:07,160 --> 02:47:10,550
See that's the fucking vr goggles for 
the soul.

3467
02:47:10,700 --> 02:47:11,533
That's what that is.
That's the way we peer into this 

3468
02:47:13,281 --> 02:47:15,350
dimension.
Look at the St Peter's Basilica.

3469
02:47:15,680 --> 02:47:18,920
These photos,
this is from [inaudible] that they built

3470
02:47:18,921 --> 02:47:22,730
in the 16 hundreds with no,
they had no computers.

3471
02:47:22,940 --> 02:47:26,240
They had no power tools.
They had no,

3472
02:47:26,250 --> 02:47:28,040
and there's photos on my instagram.
There it is.

3473
02:47:28,060 --> 02:47:28,893
So cool dude.
You're seeing it right now in a picture 

3474
02:47:32,211 --> 02:47:34,100
and I'm telling you it doesn't do it 
justice.

3475
02:47:34,101 --> 02:47:34,934
This thing's insane.
It took hundreds of years to fully 

3476
02:47:37,341 --> 02:47:41,150
complete and the size of it and the 
scale of it,

3477
02:47:41,330 --> 02:47:43,430
it's mine.
But there's one photo that I put,

3478
02:47:43,431 --> 02:47:44,264
we can see the actual people in the 
background look at the size of that 

3479
02:47:47,811 --> 02:47:48,644
fucking place.
And that is a small sliver of how big 

3480
02:47:51,081 --> 02:47:52,520
the places,
I'm telling you,

3481
02:47:52,521 --> 02:47:56,000
it's not doing it any justice.
It's perfect.

3482
02:47:56,120 --> 02:47:59,090
The artwork is staggering.
I mean,

3483
02:47:59,091 --> 02:47:59,924
staff,
everybody talks about the Sistine 

3484
02:48:01,400 --> 02:48:02,630
Chapel,
the sistine chapels.

3485
02:48:02,631 --> 02:48:04,520
Pretty fucking beautiful.
I mean,

3486
02:48:04,790 --> 02:48:06,740
without a doubt,
it's a modern,

3487
02:48:06,800 --> 02:48:07,640
I mean,
not a modern,

3488
02:48:07,641 --> 02:48:09,200
uh,
an amazing work of art.

3489
02:48:09,350 --> 02:48:12,590
But it ain't shit compared to St Peter's
Basilica.

3490
02:48:12,620 --> 02:48:15,620
Look at that.
It's the all seeing eye to this is,

3491
02:48:15,710 --> 02:48:17,240
that's the,
that's the sunroof.

3492
02:48:17,450 --> 02:48:18,740
That's the,
that's an eyeball.

3493
02:48:19,250 --> 02:48:21,380
Whatever it is.
I don't know if you now look at that,

3494
02:48:21,381 --> 02:48:22,214
that's definitely an eyeball.
A bunch of people in the eyeball and 

3495
02:48:23,741 --> 02:48:24,574
there are angels.
There's angels got stuck in God's 

3496
02:48:27,231 --> 02:48:28,650
eyeball.
Couldn't that just be alive?

3497
02:48:28,890 --> 02:48:30,110
It was impossible.
It's just whole light.

3498
02:48:30,140 --> 02:48:30,951
No,
Joe,

3499
02:48:30,951 --> 02:48:33,950
look right underneath that.
I see that pyramid right under the eye,

3500
02:48:33,980 --> 02:48:34,813
dude.
How the fuck did they even climb up 

3501
02:48:36,711 --> 02:48:37,820
there?
That,

3502
02:48:37,821 --> 02:48:38,654
that's a,
um,

3503
02:48:38,660 --> 02:48:39,493
a photo of Hercules,
that last one that's a gigantic bronze 

3504
02:48:42,651 --> 02:48:45,500
Hercules that they buried in the second 
century.

3505
02:48:45,501 --> 02:48:48,770
They build it in the second century d 
but it got hit by lightning twice.

3506
02:48:49,040 --> 02:48:51,020
And they went,
this thing is fucking Honda head.

3507
02:48:51,260 --> 02:48:53,390
So they buried him.
They buried it underground.

3508
02:48:53,391 --> 02:48:58,391
They didn't find it until 1864 wow.
He's an amazing dude that the Vatican is

3509
02:48:59,241 --> 02:49:00,500
a mind.
Fuck.

3510
02:49:00,980 --> 02:49:04,280
That floor is 1700 years old and you 
walk on it.

3511
02:49:04,430 --> 02:49:07,830
Everybody walks on it.
Thousands of people a day walk on a 1700

3512
02:49:07,831 --> 02:49:07,980
year

3513
02:49:07,980 --> 02:49:09,330
old mosaic floor.

3514
02:49:09,920 --> 02:49:10,753
Pretty cool man.
That's where they say they've got all 

3515
02:49:12,321 --> 02:49:16,280
these like hidden manuscripts and shit 
that no one's ever going to see.

3516
02:49:16,490 --> 02:49:18,950
That's what you would initially 
gravitate to.

3517
02:49:19,040 --> 02:49:21,260
Wouldn't you?
Secrets the secrets.

3518
02:49:21,290 --> 02:49:23,570
Are you kidding?
The Vatican's filled with secrets,

3519
02:49:23,571 --> 02:49:24,670
man.
A little boy's secrets.

3520
02:49:24,760 --> 02:49:27,020
David notches that lots of other shit 
too,

3521
02:49:27,021 --> 02:49:28,940
man.
They've been gathering information.

3522
02:49:29,300 --> 02:49:30,111
I mean,
think about it.

3523
02:49:30,111 --> 02:49:34,250
It's like they,
they've controlled so many world leaders

3524
02:49:34,430 --> 02:49:35,263
who have done confessions and you think 
that the Vatican doesn't like when a 

3525
02:49:38,361 --> 02:49:41,870
world leader gives a confession,
doesn't write that shit down,

3526
02:49:41,871 --> 02:49:42,704
put it in the fucking lie.
They probably have confessions of some 

3527
02:49:44,961 --> 02:49:48,860
of the greatest kings.
They knew everything.

3528
02:49:48,861 --> 02:49:51,770
Man.
It's the priest class freaking me out.

3529
02:49:52,030 --> 02:49:53,390
It's true.
You're freaking me out.

3530
02:49:53,391 --> 02:49:55,250
Anyway.
I hope I am.

3531
02:49:56,670 --> 02:50:00,590
I man,
that's a fucking Vatican.

3532
02:50:00,600 --> 02:50:02,210
Think about what that is.
That there are a country.

3533
02:50:03,020 --> 02:50:04,070
Yeah,
it's a country.

3534
02:50:04,550 --> 02:50:06,980
It's a small country.
It's a hundred acre country.

3535
02:50:07,220 --> 02:50:10,700
Every time a Catholic puts money in a 
bowl,

3536
02:50:11,270 --> 02:50:14,660
it a little bit of that money makes it 
to that fucking place.

3537
02:50:14,900 --> 02:50:19,900
That's the nexus point of dough for one 
of the world's one branch of the world's

3538
02:50:21,140 --> 02:50:24,020
main religions.
That's a fucking cool.

3539
02:50:24,110 --> 02:50:24,943
That's just all the money.
People who are like just at the end of 

3540
02:50:27,621 --> 02:50:30,500
their fucking rope,
people who have like $3,000

3541
02:50:30,501 --> 02:50:32,180
left in their bank account,
but they were like,

3542
02:50:32,181 --> 02:50:33,014
you know what?
I'm going to give this to the church 

3543
02:50:34,371 --> 02:50:35,204
because God will bless me.
They give that money to the church and 

3544
02:50:38,031 --> 02:50:38,864
that money goes straight to build an a 
fucking shitty lightening catching 

3545
02:50:42,411 --> 02:50:43,244
statue.
That's what all the money of people who 

3546
02:50:46,701 --> 02:50:47,534
desperately needed it for actual things 
has gotten sucked to the Vatican where 

3547
02:50:52,251 --> 02:50:53,084
it's used to build gold thrones that the
pope sits on and talks about the 

3548
02:50:57,951 --> 02:51:00,560
importance of charity.
It's hilarious.

3549
02:51:03,550 --> 02:51:03,980
Well,
he did.

3550
02:51:03,980 --> 02:51:04,813
The new guy doesn't do it anymore.
The new guy doesn't do sit on the 

3551
02:51:06,881 --> 02:51:08,440
throne.
Now here's a real chair.

3552
02:51:08,880 --> 02:51:12,580
He could archive six the most intriguing
documents and church history.

3553
02:51:14,430 --> 02:51:17,350
Oh my God.
Documents from the Galileo heresy trial.

3554
02:51:17,400 --> 02:51:19,420
I'd throw that one out of,
I was the Catholic Church.

3555
02:51:19,430 --> 02:51:21,960
Let's forget about that.
Forget about that.

3556
02:51:22,030 --> 02:51:25,300
She told me you wouldn't want to read 
that when they were telling him,

3557
02:51:25,301 --> 02:51:26,590
hey dude,
you're wrong.

3558
02:51:27,040 --> 02:51:29,380
The Earth is the center of the fucking 
universe now.

3559
02:51:29,410 --> 02:51:34,210
Either you want to stay in that attic 
for the rest of your life like that.

3560
02:51:34,211 --> 02:51:37,480
A serial killer lady and with that lady,
serial killer lady,

3561
02:51:37,481 --> 02:51:39,670
what was her name?
But Oh,

3562
02:51:39,700 --> 02:51:40,600
killed all the young women.

3563
02:51:40,660 --> 02:51:43,650
Henry this seventh asking for a divorce,
an anoma.

3564
02:51:43,710 --> 02:51:47,470
A king has to ask your permission.
You've become so powerful.

3565
02:51:47,471 --> 02:51:48,304
Kings are like,
can I please break up with my 

3566
02:51:49,901 --> 02:51:50,520
girlfriend?

3567
02:51:50,520 --> 02:51:52,950
That's Henry the eighth he was the one 
that chopped their heads off,

3568
02:51:53,830 --> 02:51:54,641
right?
Yeah.

3569
02:51:54,641 --> 02:51:55,474
That's the ultimate enjoyment.
That's when he got sick of sending 

3570
02:51:57,821 --> 02:51:58,654
letters.

3571
02:51:58,820 --> 02:52:01,720
They still use v I.
We had a guess.

3572
02:52:02,170 --> 02:52:03,003
You know,
you said the seventh and I said the 

3573
02:52:03,851 --> 02:52:05,950
eighth I had account those little lines.

3574
02:52:06,520 --> 02:52:07,353
That reminds me,
I'm sure you've already talked about 

3575
02:52:08,831 --> 02:52:12,220
this in the podcast and it's stupid.
So go ahead and call me stupid if,

3576
02:52:12,280 --> 02:52:13,113
and I'm sorry if you already told 
pre-claim things you know about the 

3577
02:52:15,101 --> 02:52:16,990
baron,
you know the berenstain bears?

3578
02:52:17,050 --> 02:52:17,890
Yes.
Yes.

3579
02:52:18,490 --> 02:52:19,323
Fuck yeah.
We've probably got a million vice had a 

3580
02:52:22,301 --> 02:52:22,820
whole lot

3581
02:52:22,820 --> 02:52:23,990
article about it.
I didn't,

3582
02:52:24,650 --> 02:52:25,483
I didn't really remember it,
so it wasn't that much of a revelation 

3583
02:52:27,051 --> 02:52:27,884
to me.
I don't think I read that when I was a 

3584
02:52:28,521 --> 02:52:31,070
kid.
I was more of a Dr Seuss turned kid.

3585
02:52:31,280 --> 02:52:34,010
I didn't understand that it was,
everybody thought it was steam,

3586
02:52:34,100 --> 02:52:35,690
but it was what I thought.
And then,

3587
02:52:35,810 --> 02:52:37,100
yeah,
I definitely thought that.

3588
02:52:37,330 --> 02:52:38,163
But the idea that some people remember 
that Nelson Mandela died in prison and 

3589
02:52:41,811 --> 02:52:45,370
some people think he got out.
That's the trippiest idea.

3590
02:52:45,371 --> 02:52:46,204
Have you ever,
you know,

3591
02:52:46,580 --> 02:52:48,200
Queen Song,
we are the champions.

3592
02:52:48,560 --> 02:52:52,370
Everybody think it ends with of the 
world,

3593
02:52:52,460 --> 02:52:55,910
but it doesn't,
it just ends and everybody tries to sing

3594
02:52:55,940 --> 02:52:58,250
of the world,
but it doesn't end that way.

3595
02:52:58,820 --> 02:52:59,653
Like there's a funny thing that this guy
does on youtube where he gets in a car 

3596
02:53:03,140 --> 02:53:04,970
and he drives people around,
they lip sync,

3597
02:53:05,240 --> 02:53:06,073
they sing along like Karaoke.
Rather they sing along to songs and 

3598
02:53:08,721 --> 02:53:09,554
they're singing along to the queen song.
We are the champions and it gets to the 

3599
02:53:11,871 --> 02:53:13,930
end and it's George.
Um,

3600
02:53:13,970 --> 02:53:15,230
what the fuck's his name?
The actor,

3601
02:53:15,231 --> 02:53:19,370
George Clooney and Julia Roberts and uh,
someone else.

3602
02:53:19,610 --> 02:53:23,570
I forget who the other person is and 
they're singing along and it gets to the

3603
02:53:23,571 --> 02:53:27,140
end and they all want to say of the 
world and it doesn't say that.

3604
02:53:27,141 --> 02:53:28,190
And they're like,
what the fuck?

3605
02:53:28,460 --> 02:53:31,010
And they're all confused.
And I thought it did too.

3606
02:53:31,220 --> 02:53:33,730
Everybody does.
It seems like there's a,

3607
02:53:34,300 --> 02:53:38,000
a line that we all collectively decided 
was missing from that song.

3608
02:53:38,690 --> 02:53:41,540
It's a collective fuck up of memory 
time,

3609
02:53:41,541 --> 02:53:43,220
traveler proof.
I wish we could play it,

3610
02:53:43,280 --> 02:53:45,410
but we can't play it.
They'll yank is off youtube,

3611
02:53:45,620 --> 02:53:46,453
but find the video.
See just to see if you can find the 

3612
02:53:48,051 --> 02:53:51,830
video so we could tell people what video
to watch because it's hilarious watching

3613
02:53:51,831 --> 02:53:55,250
George Clooney get to the end and want 
to say,

3614
02:53:55,400 --> 02:53:56,233
Oh man,
what a bad motherfucker Freddie Mercury 

3615
02:54:04,161 --> 02:54:06,170
was.
You ever listened to queen every now and

3616
02:54:06,171 --> 02:54:07,640
again throwing some queen.

3617
02:54:07,870 --> 02:54:09,610
It's insane.
Jesus.

3618
02:54:09,611 --> 02:54:13,000
He was good.
He was so Bohemian.

3619
02:54:13,001 --> 02:54:15,400
Rhapsody would play that.
And you're like,

3620
02:54:15,401 --> 02:54:16,370
what?
Like what a,

3621
02:54:16,410 --> 02:54:17,243
what an amazing piece of expression.
He seems like he was one of the most 

3622
02:54:22,541 --> 02:54:26,680
disciplined people when it came to his 
work.

3623
02:54:26,681 --> 02:54:29,470
Like it's,
he seems like somebody who is constantly

3624
02:54:29,920 --> 02:54:33,100
working on his voice.
Just a workaholic maybe.

3625
02:54:33,400 --> 02:54:34,233
Maybe for sure.
Unbelievably talented and [inaudible] 

3626
02:54:36,380 --> 02:54:39,190
and had an incredible knack for 
expressing himself.

3627
02:54:39,300 --> 02:54:41,400
How she wasn't even at some NPR 
interview with,

3628
02:54:41,401 --> 02:54:42,350
uh,
I can't remember.

3629
02:54:42,351 --> 02:54:43,184
She's a famous broadway singer and she's
talking about what she does every day 

3630
02:54:46,360 --> 02:54:48,460
and it's crazy.
Oh to sing on Broadway.

3631
02:54:48,490 --> 02:54:49,840
Oh God.
She's like,

3632
02:54:49,841 --> 02:54:50,674
it's like three hours of physical 
exercise a day mixed in with an hour of 

3633
02:54:56,051 --> 02:54:59,500
meditation.
Makes them with vocal exercises.

3634
02:54:59,501 --> 02:55:00,334
So it's like every single day she's 
doing like an eight hour prep for this 

3635
02:55:04,881 --> 02:55:07,220
shit that she's doing.
It's amazing when you

3636
02:55:07,640 --> 02:55:09,440
hear about people who are at that 
discipline.

3637
02:55:09,590 --> 02:55:10,910
Yeah.
That's not good for us.

3638
02:55:10,970 --> 02:55:12,050
We can't do that shit,
dude.

3639
02:55:12,080 --> 02:55:14,450
What is this is them,
they get to the end.

3640
02:55:14,480 --> 02:55:15,980
Oh,
it's Gwen Steffani was the other one.

3641
02:55:16,400 --> 02:55:21,400
We owe the chain the chain.
Okay.

3642
02:55:21,471 --> 02:55:23,150
We can't play it because it's not the 
music.

3643
02:55:23,151 --> 02:55:23,984
It's just dumb singing.
But we can't do it because it's their 

3644
02:55:26,301 --> 02:55:28,970
video yet.
It's James Corden show.

3645
02:55:29,030 --> 02:55:30,140
Who's James Corden?
The late,

3646
02:55:30,141 --> 02:55:34,280
late show he took over for Craig 
Ferguson this past year,

3647
02:55:34,281 --> 02:55:37,810
I think.
Here they go.

3648
02:55:39,620 --> 02:55:42,290
They get to the part at the end.
No,

3649
02:55:42,291 --> 02:55:44,210
we don't have to see this.
I'm scared.

3650
02:55:44,550 --> 02:55:46,010
Yeah,
we're going to get yanked off youtube.

3651
02:55:46,630 --> 02:55:47,463
Uh,
there was a big thing that I tweeted 

3652
02:55:48,321 --> 02:55:51,380
today where some guy was talking about 
his audio book being on Youtube.

3653
02:55:51,540 --> 02:55:52,310
Oh yeah,
I saw that.

3654
02:55:52,310 --> 02:55:53,310
Yeah.
And people are,

3655
02:55:53,430 --> 02:55:56,390
this guy said that he sold 50,000
audio books,

3656
02:55:56,600 --> 02:56:00,350
but there was like 19,000
views or something like that on Youtube.

3657
02:56:00,350 --> 02:56:01,730
And he was like,
what in the fuck?

3658
02:56:01,731 --> 02:56:05,480
Like that's a giant chunk of the people 
that have listened to my book,

3659
02:56:05,660 --> 02:56:07,430
pirated it,
you know,

3660
02:56:07,490 --> 02:56:08,301
and he's like,
Hey,

3661
02:56:08,301 --> 02:56:09,134
I get,
this is how I make a living when I get 

3662
02:56:09,921 --> 02:56:12,320
paid from this stuff.
It's interesting because you know,

3663
02:56:12,410 --> 02:56:15,560
obviously youtube has them up and they,
you know,

3664
02:56:15,590 --> 02:56:18,260
somehow or another,
someone puts it up there and they didn't

3665
02:56:18,261 --> 02:56:20,670
get it down without a request.
Like Yep,

3666
02:56:20,730 --> 02:56:22,940
there's an algorithm that finds it.
You have to find it.

3667
02:56:23,090 --> 02:56:23,923
So like it's totally possible.
I'm sure a lot of your bits or up there 

3668
02:56:25,881 --> 02:56:28,400
somewhere where someone's put them up 
and they put them up on the channel.

3669
02:56:28,800 --> 02:56:29,930
You just don't,
you don't know.

3670
02:56:29,960 --> 02:56:32,240
You mean from the podcast,
from podcasts,

3671
02:56:32,270 --> 02:56:33,550
from staff,
from,

3672
02:56:33,800 --> 02:56:36,650
but imagine if you had a book and you 
made all your money.

3673
02:56:36,800 --> 02:56:37,633
If you're an author or you make all your
money off the audio book or a big 

3674
02:56:39,880 --> 02:56:43,460
percentage at least,
can't they just claim 100 right?

3675
02:56:43,520 --> 02:56:45,470
Claim wonders,
get it off.

3676
02:56:45,800 --> 02:56:49,250
But those 19,000
views he doesn't get,

3677
02:56:49,550 --> 02:56:51,320
those are gone.
You know,

3678
02:56:51,730 --> 02:56:55,840
like how many of those 19,000
views would have translated into selling

3679
02:56:55,841 --> 02:56:57,100
an audio book?
Is that real

3680
02:56:57,220 --> 02:56:58,880
question is the real question,
if any.

3681
02:56:59,210 --> 02:57:00,880
And here's the real question for 
standups,

3682
02:57:00,940 --> 02:57:01,773
right?
The always the question is when you are 

3683
02:57:03,471 --> 02:57:05,150
bits,
make it on youtube,

3684
02:57:05,151 --> 02:57:07,190
like say if you do a comedy central 
special in particular,

3685
02:57:07,191 --> 02:57:09,230
right.
And then your bits make it on youtube,

3686
02:57:09,590 --> 02:57:13,070
the more people pirate your stuff.
I don't know if you'd call it pirating,

3687
02:57:13,100 --> 02:57:14,780
but more they take it and they put it on
Youtube,

3688
02:57:14,781 --> 02:57:16,820
the more people are going to see you,
the more people are going to come to see

3689
02:57:16,821 --> 02:57:17,654
you,
the more it's going to be worth it to 

3690
02:57:19,551 --> 02:57:21,550
you to do another comedy central spot.
Right?

3691
02:57:21,551 --> 02:57:22,384
Right.
So it becomes different for us because 

3692
02:57:24,231 --> 02:57:26,990
we,
we kind of exist for the live shows,

3693
02:57:26,991 --> 02:57:28,280
like the live shows,
the big,

3694
02:57:28,490 --> 02:57:29,870
big part of what we do.
Right?

3695
02:57:29,920 --> 02:57:30,753
Yeah.
And anything that'll get more people to 

3696
02:57:32,031 --> 02:57:33,830
go to the live shows,
it's like a better thing,

3697
02:57:34,490 --> 02:57:35,450
right?
Yeah.

3698
02:57:35,510 --> 02:57:37,940
Yeah.
How it thinks how now for an author,

3699
02:57:39,170 --> 02:57:40,490
for that guy,
he's,

3700
02:57:40,491 --> 02:57:42,260
he feels like he got fucked.
You know,

3701
02:57:42,780 --> 02:57:45,300
well I think,
wasn't he saying that like Youtube,

3702
02:57:45,360 --> 02:57:46,193
like culpable here,
like youtube is making money off of the 

3703
02:57:47,911 --> 02:57:48,744
thing in some indirect way that and 
acting like they're not like it is like 

3704
02:57:53,461 --> 02:57:57,060
who's the person who is because the 
person who uploaded it,

3705
02:57:57,470 --> 02:57:59,970
are they generating money from the thing
or are they,

3706
02:57:59,971 --> 02:58:02,070
did they just upload it because love it?
That's a good

3707
02:58:02,070 --> 02:58:03,330
question.
I don't know.

3708
02:58:03,510 --> 02:58:03,991
Yeah,
that,

3709
02:58:03,991 --> 02:58:05,390
that,
that's where it gets weird is it?

3710
02:58:05,420 --> 02:58:07,560
And,
and I think in the article he was saying

3711
02:58:07,561 --> 02:58:08,790
how,
you know,

3712
02:58:08,791 --> 02:58:09,624
with a lot of music now,
thank God when you upload it on your 

3713
02:58:11,821 --> 02:58:14,310
Youtube Stream,
they just get a,

3714
02:58:14,400 --> 02:58:17,020
they just get the profits from whatever 
you're advertising.

3715
02:58:17,640 --> 02:58:20,250
And that's way better than what it used 
to be.

3716
02:58:20,251 --> 02:58:22,050
They just need,
they need to upgrade the system.

3717
02:58:22,051 --> 02:58:27,051
So this guy gets the same deal he has 
with audible anytime somebody listens to

3718
02:58:27,121 --> 02:58:27,960
the book.

3719
02:58:28,050 --> 02:58:28,531
Yeah,
I mean,

3720
02:58:28,531 --> 02:58:30,660
I definitely think that he deserves that
for sure.

3721
02:58:30,780 --> 02:58:33,690
But here's my weirdness about all this.
You know,

3722
02:58:33,691 --> 02:58:34,524
we were talking about language and the 
limitations of language and the 

3723
02:58:37,860 --> 02:58:38,693
eventuality of a virtual reality.
And I wonder how we're going to digest 

3724
02:58:44,280 --> 02:58:45,113
data and information in a virtual world.
Like if people decide like what if you 

3725
02:58:50,011 --> 02:58:54,120
decide that you want to read books in a 
virtual world,

3726
02:58:54,750 --> 02:58:55,583
this is how you want to read books.
The way you want to read books is what 

3727
02:58:57,271 --> 02:59:01,080
your feet up on the couch in your 
mansion and your virtual world.

3728
02:59:01,290 --> 02:59:02,123
All these girls around you like finger 
banging themselves with a high heels on 

3729
02:59:05,441 --> 02:59:07,050
and Queens,
fat bottom girls.

3730
02:59:07,051 --> 02:59:08,550
You make a rock in the world,
go round,

3731
02:59:08,551 --> 02:59:09,384
plays in the background share,
and you get to sit down and read books 

3732
02:59:11,041 --> 02:59:13,140
in a virtual world.
What happens then?

3733
02:59:13,320 --> 02:59:16,290
Like what?
What happens when you're watching movies

3734
02:59:16,291 --> 02:59:18,510
in a virtual world?
That's probably,

3735
02:59:18,990 --> 02:59:20,340
that'd be stupid.
Famous streaming.

3736
02:59:20,370 --> 02:59:22,470
I think the movies would be,
they would exist.

3737
02:59:23,040 --> 02:59:25,590
I think movies in a virtual world,
they're definitely coming,

3738
02:59:25,591 --> 02:59:26,281
right?
And they're going to,

3739
02:59:26,281 --> 02:59:27,114
you're going to exist in the world like 
you're not gonna sit down and watch a 

3740
02:59:28,801 --> 02:59:29,030
movie.

3741
02:59:29,030 --> 02:59:29,863
Oh No.
They have a great theory theaters in Vr 

3742
02:59:31,971 --> 02:59:35,550
now you can sit down,
put on a movie and watch it on.

3743
02:59:35,600 --> 02:59:38,990
Unlike a massive screen in vr there.
I went to,

3744
02:59:38,991 --> 02:59:39,824
don't you think,

3745
02:59:40,080 --> 02:59:43,170
why do they do that as their limitations
in the medium where they can't have it?

3746
02:59:43,260 --> 02:59:45,480
Uh,
the movie play out in front of you.

3747
02:59:45,900 --> 02:59:47,100
Like if you went to see jaws,

3748
02:59:47,840 --> 02:59:48,630
oh,
that's dope.

3749
02:59:48,630 --> 02:59:52,110
It's kind of Nice to watch a movie 
floating in space.

3750
02:59:52,560 --> 02:59:53,393
I don't mind that the virtue of you,
there's an app called virtual desktop 

3751
02:59:56,280 --> 02:59:57,113
where you like,
you put on your vr goggles and suddenly 

3752
03:00:00,331 --> 03:00:05,040
your desktop is wrapped around you,
a giant screen,

3753
03:00:05,070 --> 03:00:05,903
giant screen wrapped around you that you
then can like pull up any kind of movie 

3754
03:00:11,341 --> 03:00:12,174
you might want to watch.
And so you just like can sit in there 

3755
03:00:14,701 --> 03:00:16,260
and why.
And if you look down,

3756
03:00:17,880 --> 03:00:19,830
you see space.
Yeah,

3757
03:00:20,100 --> 03:00:21,210
that's it.
Virtual desktop that.

3758
03:00:21,211 --> 03:00:23,670
Now the problem with Vr,
when you look at that,

3759
03:00:23,730 --> 03:00:24,563
the problem with Vr,
like people looking at it on the 

3760
03:00:26,251 --> 03:00:31,251
Internet is it you cannot convey how 
fucking cool it looks from looking at it

3761
03:00:33,061 --> 03:00:37,110
that way.
Like it is suddenly there's this massive

3762
03:00:37,111 --> 03:00:39,180
thing in front of you.
The space look real,

3763
03:00:39,210 --> 03:00:41,220
what the space looked real.
Um,

3764
03:00:41,250 --> 03:00:44,640
it,
it looks real enough pretty.

3765
03:00:44,700 --> 03:00:46,910
I wouldn't say that.
I mean I wouldn't say realistic.

3766
03:00:47,220 --> 03:00:48,053
I think there are probably some,
there's got to be by now some three 60 

3767
03:00:50,731 --> 03:00:55,290
videos that are actually from the,
from Hubble,

3768
03:00:55,530 --> 03:00:57,480
but it looks good enough where you're 
like,

3769
03:00:57,630 --> 03:01:00,040
this is fucking incredible.
Well what's the benefit

3770
03:01:00,040 --> 03:01:02,170
of like they're just watching you play a
video game.

3771
03:01:02,171 --> 03:01:03,004
What's the benefit and playing a video 
game on a screen in a virtual world 

3772
03:01:05,621 --> 03:01:08,260
instead of playing the video game in the
virtual world?

3773
03:01:08,320 --> 03:01:11,260
Well I think,
but honestly in that case,

3774
03:01:11,261 --> 03:01:12,094
I don't know.
Like I've,

3775
03:01:12,130 --> 03:01:13,690
I started a game up in there and he's 
like,

3776
03:01:13,691 --> 03:01:15,460
fuck this.
You see what I'm saying here?

3777
03:01:15,461 --> 03:01:17,290
Because like he's clicking and menus and
stuff.

3778
03:01:17,291 --> 03:01:18,550
He's using it like a computer.

3779
03:01:19,500 --> 03:01:20,670
Yeah.
I think it's a,

3780
03:01:20,671 --> 03:01:24,480
I don't know if the benefit is the right
thing to look for there.

3781
03:01:24,481 --> 03:01:25,314
It's just,
it's just bad ass to like suddenly be 

3782
03:01:27,991 --> 03:01:32,991
completely immersed in a new environment
doing like whatever the work is that you

3783
03:01:33,931 --> 03:01:38,850
want to do that with virtual desktop.
I just use it to watch documentaries

3784
03:01:40,290 --> 03:01:43,030
about bleeding.
But what I'm thinking is like,

3785
03:01:43,080 --> 03:01:44,610
would you rather like,
okay,

3786
03:01:44,670 --> 03:01:46,650
like they're perfect example,
you're looking at a screen,

3787
03:01:46,651 --> 03:01:47,910
right?
Clearly a floating screen,

3788
03:01:47,911 --> 03:01:49,770
if you watch jaws and that floating 
screen,

3789
03:01:49,950 --> 03:01:50,783
that would not be as good as if you were
sitting in your living room when you're 

3790
03:01:52,631 --> 03:01:54,960
looking down.
You were on the boat with Roy Scheider.

3791
03:01:55,070 --> 03:01:56,480
Well he was like,
we're gonna need a bigger boat.

3792
03:01:56,500 --> 03:01:57,333
Oh,
you mean like if there was like a vr 

3793
03:01:58,171 --> 03:01:59,380
jaws?
Yes.

3794
03:01:59,400 --> 03:02:00,510
Oh yeah,
that'd be fucking cool.

3795
03:02:00,511 --> 03:02:02,000
It just doesn't exist yet.
Right.

3796
03:02:02,010 --> 03:02:04,710
But that's what I'm saying.
Like that's going to happen.

3797
03:02:04,711 --> 03:02:05,790
Right?
Of course.

3798
03:02:05,820 --> 03:02:08,160
Yeah,
that'll definitely happen for sure.

3799
03:02:08,161 --> 03:02:11,010
No question.
And when they do things like that,

3800
03:02:11,280 --> 03:02:15,090
like will you be able to enjoy other 
things in that world?

3801
03:02:15,091 --> 03:02:16,620
Like will you be able to go into that 
world?

3802
03:02:16,621 --> 03:02:19,500
Like here we're in the Swiss Alps,
where the fuck we are in a fake world?

3803
03:02:19,830 --> 03:02:23,640
Would you be able to go to this place 
and put on a,

3804
03:02:23,670 --> 03:02:25,500
an a,
a podcast?

3805
03:02:25,740 --> 03:02:28,230
Like would you be able to like look down
at your phone,

3806
03:02:28,320 --> 03:02:29,153
find the Duncan trussell family hour and
start streaming it live on your phone 

3807
03:02:33,780 --> 03:02:36,360
while you're skiing down the side of 
this virtual hill,

3808
03:02:36,420 --> 03:02:37,160
which you're building.

3809
03:02:37,160 --> 03:02:39,160
You can already,
you can already do that.

3810
03:02:39,161 --> 03:02:40,850
You could already do that.
Yeah.

3811
03:02:40,851 --> 03:02:41,840
Look,
I mean look man,

3812
03:02:41,841 --> 03:02:42,674
this is like rick and Morty is video 
game is in Vr is accepting that you're 

3813
03:02:47,961 --> 03:02:50,690
in vr and,
and they're,

3814
03:02:50,691 --> 03:02:51,351
they're,
yeah,

3815
03:02:51,351 --> 03:02:52,184
there's like there's a,
there's all kinds of shit you could do 

3816
03:02:54,441 --> 03:02:55,370
in there.
Like for example,

3817
03:02:55,371 --> 03:02:56,001
man,
there's a,

3818
03:02:56,001 --> 03:02:56,834
um,
in one of these games called fantastic 

3819
03:02:58,761 --> 03:03:02,390
contraption,
which is one of the most site dude show,

3820
03:03:02,391 --> 03:03:04,910
split reality,
fantastic contraption.

3821
03:03:04,911 --> 03:03:08,780
If you looked at this where people have 
managed to put up a green screen so that

3822
03:03:08,800 --> 03:03:09,633
can interpolate the two videos.
So it looks like you're actually in the 

3823
03:03:13,251 --> 03:03:15,020
game.
That's the clothes show.

3824
03:03:15,021 --> 03:03:15,854
That fantastic contraption is this.
Everything in there is fucking 

3825
03:03:18,861 --> 03:03:20,570
psychedelic.
But check this out.

3826
03:03:20,571 --> 03:03:24,560
When you see people in the,
in the reality itself,

3827
03:03:25,130 --> 03:03:26,000
yeah.
There you go.

3828
03:03:26,180 --> 03:03:27,650
Whoa.
Watch what he does.

3829
03:03:27,680 --> 03:03:29,900
So this guy's walking around.
This is what he's seeing.

3830
03:03:29,930 --> 03:03:31,700
So what we're looking at and what are we
seeing?

3831
03:03:31,730 --> 03:03:32,563
Does this gonna what?
We're going to kicked off use youtube 

3832
03:03:33,591 --> 03:03:35,190
for this.
You don't need the daughter?

3833
03:03:35,191 --> 03:03:36,920
Yeah.
Don't know audio please.

3834
03:03:37,400 --> 03:03:40,580
I'm worried.
But then so this guy's moving around and

3835
03:03:40,581 --> 03:03:43,160
while he's moving around,
he's doing a bunch of stuff.

3836
03:03:43,190 --> 03:03:45,160
He's got a bunch of front of house one 
though.

3837
03:03:45,170 --> 03:03:46,280
For sure.
There's like,

3838
03:03:46,560 --> 03:03:48,800
well it takes to explain to the people 
that are listening what we're saying.

3839
03:03:49,170 --> 03:03:49,751
Oh yeah,
you're,

3840
03:03:49,751 --> 03:03:52,110
you're just seeing like in fantastic 
contraption.

3841
03:03:52,200 --> 03:03:54,050
What is that?
What is fantastic contraption?

3842
03:03:54,060 --> 03:03:59,060
You're in this like weird putting green 
and you have to build amazing devices to

3843
03:03:59,271 --> 03:04:00,400
um,
Eh,

3844
03:04:00,410 --> 03:04:02,000
the white.
Unfortunately these videos,

3845
03:04:02,001 --> 03:04:04,940
you're not seeing the guy actually form 
the shit.

3846
03:04:04,970 --> 03:04:05,810
Like watch this.

3847
03:04:07,390 --> 03:04:09,030
What am I watching Dunkin?
We started,

3848
03:04:09,040 --> 03:04:10,240
people are listening.
Watch this.

3849
03:04:10,600 --> 03:04:11,400
Oh,
sorry.

3850
03:04:11,400 --> 03:04:12,300
You're seeing,
look at this.

3851
03:04:12,301 --> 03:04:15,690
Look at this.
You have to stretch out these like tubes

3852
03:04:15,691 --> 03:04:20,691
to build this weird device that you like
then automates itself to try to,

3853
03:04:21,340 --> 03:04:22,141
I mean,
honest to God,

3854
03:04:22,141 --> 03:04:24,150
talking about it,
you feel like a fucking,

3855
03:04:24,151 --> 03:04:26,690
you're listening to an eight year old 
talk about a drawing

3856
03:04:26,840 --> 03:04:27,770
they made.
Like what?

3857
03:04:27,771 --> 03:04:31,640
What are you talking about?
It's impossible to convey.

3858
03:04:31,670 --> 03:04:34,580
It's a game and it's a game where this 
guy is moving,

3859
03:04:34,790 --> 03:04:35,623
he's got devices in his hand and then 
devices move things in the virtual 

3860
03:04:39,141 --> 03:04:39,974
world.
He's holding on to these two like a 

3861
03:04:41,240 --> 03:04:42,920
controllers.
But this is not a good,

3862
03:04:42,930 --> 03:04:46,280
if you look up crazy matter,
it's pretty fucking he fucking cool.

3863
03:04:46,620 --> 03:04:48,110
Yeah.
You'll see it on Friday.

3864
03:04:48,111 --> 03:04:48,944
I'll show you.
I've got us and what we need to talk 

3865
03:04:49,941 --> 03:04:50,774
about his porn.

3866
03:04:51,550 --> 03:04:53,950
What's that like Duncan?
What's it like in this world?

3867
03:04:54,220 --> 03:04:55,960
What's it like?
So,

3868
03:04:55,961 --> 03:05:00,730
um,
I mean it's like I'll tell you something

3869
03:05:00,731 --> 03:05:02,740
even better than porn man.
Oh.

3870
03:05:03,320 --> 03:05:04,153
Um,
here's what's really cool about vr that 

3871
03:05:06,611 --> 03:05:08,080
I don't think a lot of people have 
caught onto.

3872
03:05:08,081 --> 03:05:13,081
Maybe a few of them have.
Cause the porn of course is amazing.

3873
03:05:13,600 --> 03:05:15,610
It is an,
it is.

3874
03:05:15,611 --> 03:05:19,900
If anything is going to drive vr and I 
hope everything drives Vr,

3875
03:05:20,110 --> 03:05:20,943
it's going to be the fucking porn 
because the porn that is shot for Vr is 

3876
03:05:28,690 --> 03:05:29,523
very,
very close to like experiencing having 

3877
03:05:31,991 --> 03:05:34,900
sex with someone,
obviously minus the body.

3878
03:05:34,901 --> 03:05:36,310
Right?
There's nobody there.

3879
03:05:36,311 --> 03:05:41,311
There's nobody there.
But it's amazing and it's going to cause

3880
03:05:41,621 --> 03:05:46,621
a lot of great and hilarious problems.
And I'm excited to hear the outrage that

3881
03:05:46,811 --> 03:05:47,644
comes from the world when people start 
realizing that every single person on 

3882
03:05:51,131 --> 03:05:55,960
earth now has access not just to in a 
voyeuristic way witnessing,

3883
03:05:56,320 --> 03:05:57,340
uh,
Ooh,

3884
03:05:57,730 --> 03:05:59,410
that,
that I'm telling you man,

3885
03:05:59,590 --> 03:06:00,550
that is,
that's,

3886
03:06:01,120 --> 03:06:04,420
that's what those girls acids and insane
and so she's right in front of you.

3887
03:06:04,421 --> 03:06:05,254
But this is,
they're not doing a good job with us 

3888
03:06:05,861 --> 03:06:06,820
cause it's got to

3889
03:06:07,310 --> 03:06:08,900
eyeball.
That's just how it,

3890
03:06:08,990 --> 03:06:09,711
yeah,
you,

3891
03:06:09,711 --> 03:06:12,440
you,
you have to use virtual desktop to bring

3892
03:06:12,441 --> 03:06:13,274
those two things together.
Like the porn that you download is 

3893
03:06:16,761 --> 03:06:21,140
broken up in stereoscopic.
So the vr goggles bring it together

3894
03:06:21,320 --> 03:06:22,153
to kill you.
You have to get specific programs that 

3895
03:06:24,091 --> 03:06:25,260
are designed for this,
right?

3896
03:06:26,270 --> 03:06:27,800
Yeah.
Like a,

3897
03:06:27,801 --> 03:06:29,150
yeah,
just google search.

3898
03:06:29,151 --> 03:06:31,970
Reddit,
how not to watch vr porn.

3899
03:06:32,020 --> 03:06:32,853
So these guys that are watching it,
like we're watching this guy who's 

3900
03:06:34,720 --> 03:06:35,553
sitting on his bed and like he's looks 
like he's doing everything to keep from 

3901
03:06:37,751 --> 03:06:38,584
coming in his pants.
He's laugh like I don't ever watch porn 

3902
03:06:40,751 --> 03:06:41,584
like that.
There's like sheer joy and him watching 

3903
03:06:43,781 --> 03:06:44,614
that porn,
like what you're talking about is 

3904
03:06:46,631 --> 03:06:49,360
something that's very different than 
watching a two dimensional screen.

3905
03:06:49,470 --> 03:06:50,303
It's,
it's as different as sax and watching a 

3906
03:06:52,961 --> 03:06:56,430
two dimensional screen except there's no
body there.

3907
03:06:56,431 --> 03:07:00,210
I mean you are in,
you look or you can look around,

3908
03:07:00,211 --> 03:07:01,530
you can like,
you know,

3909
03:07:01,531 --> 03:07:04,200
like for example,
let's say there was a,

3910
03:07:04,470 --> 03:07:06,630
and by the way,
I'm not doing this shit.

3911
03:07:06,900 --> 03:07:09,150
A friend of mine watches it,
but let's say,

3912
03:07:10,110 --> 03:07:11,700
let's say that there was a,
um,

3913
03:07:12,000 --> 03:07:13,470
let's say that there was a,
uh,

3914
03:07:13,830 --> 03:07:14,611
uh,
in a,

3915
03:07:14,611 --> 03:07:15,444
in a vr porn experience,
there's a girl who's giving you a blow 

3916
03:07:18,031 --> 03:07:22,170
job while another girl is shoving your 
pussy in your face.

3917
03:07:22,680 --> 03:07:25,950
You can actually look up and see your 
pussy,

3918
03:07:26,070 --> 03:07:29,320
not our pussy.
You can look around her pussy and see,

3919
03:07:29,420 --> 03:07:33,030
see your face looking down at you just 
like it was really happening.

3920
03:07:33,210 --> 03:07:36,440
So that's Vr porn.
That's what it's alignment.

3921
03:07:36,450 --> 03:07:37,283
You can look at her pussy and then you 
can go back to sure the girls sucking 

3922
03:07:39,161 --> 03:07:39,400
your Dick.

3923
03:07:39,400 --> 03:07:40,250
You give,
you have,

3924
03:07:40,470 --> 03:07:41,303
you can move anywhere.
You could stare at her feet if you're a 

3925
03:07:42,331 --> 03:07:43,164
Weirdo or not.
If you just were a fan of feet either 

3926
03:07:48,181 --> 03:07:49,530
way,
either way.

3927
03:07:49,590 --> 03:07:50,423
Either way.
It's,

3928
03:07:50,620 --> 03:07:51,241
it's,
it's,

3929
03:07:51,241 --> 03:07:53,490
and it's still a game changer.
It's a game changer,

3930
03:07:53,491 --> 03:07:54,324
man.
It's a game changer and it's one of the 

3931
03:07:55,081 --> 03:07:58,590
many freedoms the virtual reality's 
offering people.

3932
03:07:58,710 --> 03:07:59,543
It's like you were saying,
who wants to like even just watching a 

3933
03:08:02,581 --> 03:08:06,060
movie in two D in your virtual reality 
room,

3934
03:08:06,360 --> 03:08:07,193
it's pretty awesome.
Maybe you don't have the greatest 

3935
03:08:09,171 --> 03:08:10,110
apartment,
right?

3936
03:08:10,380 --> 03:08:15,380
But you put on vr goggles and suddenly 
your apartment has transformed into a,

3937
03:08:16,440 --> 03:08:21,440
into a massive,
beautiful space in the htc vive.

3938
03:08:21,931 --> 03:08:25,710
It comes with like Vr home and there's 
two different versions.

3939
03:08:25,711 --> 03:08:26,544
But when you go into this space,
you feel that same sense of 

3940
03:08:29,971 --> 03:08:34,410
expansiveness that you get from being in
a big space,

3941
03:08:34,430 --> 03:08:34,650
right?

3942
03:08:34,650 --> 03:08:36,240
Like it's,
your body's still like,

3943
03:08:36,241 --> 03:08:38,190
feels like it's,
you know,

3944
03:08:38,250 --> 03:08:39,083
you're in a,
you still feel that weird sense of 

3945
03:08:40,680 --> 03:08:45,480
freedom that you feel when you're in a 
big space and you're not there.

3946
03:08:45,780 --> 03:08:47,040
It's beautiful,
man.

3947
03:08:47,041 --> 03:08:51,660
It's like one of the most liberating,
incredible technologies.

3948
03:08:52,050 --> 03:08:52,883
I think that a lot,
some people are giving it a little bit 

3949
03:08:54,991 --> 03:08:59,760
of a hard time right now because they 
see the game from Youtube and they think

3950
03:08:59,790 --> 03:09:02,430
those graphics look like Shit.
But let me tell you,

3951
03:09:02,431 --> 03:09:05,940
man,
do minecraft in Vr.

3952
03:09:05,941 --> 03:09:08,400
Like I just,
I did minecraft and Vr.

3953
03:09:08,460 --> 03:09:09,293
I play my graft vr regularly now,
but you do minecraft and vr and when 

3954
03:09:13,381 --> 03:09:18,381
suddenly you're perched on the edge of a
cliff looking down on some hyper colored

3955
03:09:21,210 --> 03:09:22,043
underground river,
your body initially reacts in the same 

3956
03:09:25,321 --> 03:09:27,240
way or reacts to being at the edge of a 
real cliff.

3957
03:09:27,450 --> 03:09:28,950
Your balance gets weird.
You're like,

3958
03:09:28,951 --> 03:09:29,700
fuck,
fuck,

3959
03:09:29,700 --> 03:09:31,860
fuck.
It's that real.

3960
03:09:32,040 --> 03:09:37,040
That's the vive.
The htc vive is in fucking saying,

3961
03:09:37,680 --> 03:09:39,540
Jesus,
I can't wait to show you man.

3962
03:09:39,541 --> 03:09:41,640
It's like,
it just works.

3963
03:09:41,670 --> 03:09:43,140
It doesn't,
it doesn't mess up.

3964
03:09:43,141 --> 03:09:48,141
Like anytime I want to now I can go.
I've made a room in my house where now I

3965
03:09:49,231 --> 03:09:52,530
can just put on these goggles and I'm 
instantly in.

3966
03:09:52,680 --> 03:09:55,360
Oh fucking there's a game called a hover
junkers,

3967
03:09:55,750 --> 03:09:58,570
which is so fun.
So you,

3968
03:09:58,571 --> 03:10:00,630
um,
you,

3969
03:10:00,640 --> 03:10:01,780
you could,
you could probably pull it up.

3970
03:10:01,960 --> 03:10:02,793
You ride around like it knows how big 
the space is that what's called your 

3971
03:10:06,581 --> 03:10:08,440
play space.
They knows how big it is.

3972
03:10:08,800 --> 03:10:11,740
So you're riding in a craft in this 
place,

3973
03:10:11,741 --> 03:10:16,741
space shooting weapons at people flying 
around in these other things.

3974
03:10:17,410 --> 03:10:19,060
Yeah.
It's so you could like,

3975
03:10:19,061 --> 03:10:21,940
you could all go in your garage and you 
could,

3976
03:10:21,941 --> 03:10:22,774
uh,
the garage would become the environment 

3977
03:10:24,730 --> 03:10:25,870
where you're playing your game.

3978
03:10:26,050 --> 03:10:26,741
Oh yeah.
Man,

3979
03:10:26,741 --> 03:10:27,574
you're not in your garage anymore.
You're flying around in that fucking 

3980
03:10:29,831 --> 03:10:32,650
thing shooting at people,
which means you actually have to be good

3981
03:10:32,651 --> 03:10:35,140
at shooting.
Like you have to be able to aim,

3982
03:10:35,141 --> 03:10:37,210
this isn't like pressing buttons.
Like,

3983
03:10:37,211 --> 03:10:40,200
you need to know how to fire at least at
some Saudi,

3984
03:10:40,240 --> 03:10:42,130
what are you holding?
Are you holding a fake gun?

3985
03:10:42,160 --> 03:10:45,670
Now you're holding these controllers 
that feel exactly like a fucking,

3986
03:10:45,671 --> 03:10:48,970
they feel very close to a gun and it's 
got haptic technology.

3987
03:10:49,210 --> 03:10:50,043
So when you're shooting it's vibrating.
I wonder if this would actually teach 

3988
03:10:53,081 --> 03:10:54,460
you how to shoot better.
They have,

3989
03:10:54,740 --> 03:10:57,080
they have a great archery program.
Is,

3990
03:10:57,130 --> 03:10:59,620
is it making your art tree better?
Uh,

3991
03:10:59,621 --> 03:11:02,170
it's making me not do archery cause I 
just do it.

3992
03:11:03,540 --> 03:11:05,650
It's way easier.
Are you good at it?

3993
03:11:05,680 --> 03:11:07,090
Are you good at this archery?
Yeah,

3994
03:11:07,091 --> 03:11:12,040
it me doing real archery jet definitely 
translated into me playing look up the,

3995
03:11:12,220 --> 03:11:13,570
I'm sorry to keep asking.
You look up stuff.

3996
03:11:13,571 --> 03:11:14,530
Jamie.
Look up,

3997
03:11:14,770 --> 03:11:16,000
uh,
archery.

3998
03:11:16,210 --> 03:11:17,043
The lab vr.
This is one of my favorite archery 

3999
03:11:19,691 --> 03:11:22,510
programs.
They also have a vr boxing,

4000
03:11:22,511 --> 03:11:26,830
which I haven't tried yet,
but which I'm excited about because that

4001
03:11:26,950 --> 03:11:29,770
seems like you could really train people
to learn how to box.

4002
03:11:32,310 --> 03:11:34,560
Let's see.
I'm s I don't know if this is,

4003
03:11:37,470 --> 03:11:38,071
yeah,
that's,

4004
03:11:38,071 --> 03:11:42,430
that's a different archery program than 
the one that look up the lab.

4005
03:11:43,800 --> 03:11:44,440
Okay.

4006
03:11:44,440 --> 03:11:45,071
Ah,
fuck.

4007
03:11:45,071 --> 03:11:47,290
It's,
it's valve look up valve archery.

4008
03:11:47,291 --> 03:11:50,110
Vr.
Now there is,

4009
03:11:50,111 --> 03:11:52,090
yeah.
This one's a really fucking fun man.

4010
03:11:52,620 --> 03:11:53,040
Okay.

4011
03:11:53,040 --> 03:11:55,290
Yeah.
This one is fucking cool.

4012
03:11:55,770 --> 03:11:56,603
You just shoot it.
These little guys who are trying to 

4013
03:11:57,691 --> 03:11:59,730
infiltrate your,
oh,

4014
03:11:59,790 --> 03:12:02,070
so you're shooting at things.
Yeah.

4015
03:12:02,130 --> 03:12:03,660
And it's,
so it's a game.

4016
03:12:03,700 --> 03:12:04,770
Yeah.
My God.

4017
03:12:04,771 --> 03:12:07,410
And you are you pulling a bow back?
Like what are you doing in your hand?

4018
03:12:07,411 --> 03:12:09,930
So you have two controllers,
you're pulling them back.

4019
03:12:09,931 --> 03:12:12,630
There's haptics.
So it vibrates according to this,

4020
03:12:12,810 --> 03:12:15,930
the tension of the bow string.
And then when you want an Arrow,

4021
03:12:15,931 --> 03:12:18,660
you're reaching behind your back and 
pulling it from behind your back.

4022
03:12:18,690 --> 03:12:19,960
Dot is nuts,
man.

4023
03:12:19,961 --> 03:12:21,180
Yeah,
it's so fun.

4024
03:12:21,190 --> 03:12:24,660
I wonder if it actually could help your 
archery skill for sure.

4025
03:12:24,930 --> 03:12:27,930
The only problem is it's really weird 
because you get used to like,

4026
03:12:28,260 --> 03:12:29,093
um,
it's different because you use a 

4027
03:12:30,031 --> 03:12:30,960
compound bow,
but you know,

4028
03:12:30,961 --> 03:12:31,441
you get,
you know,

4029
03:12:31,441 --> 03:12:32,191
it's,
it's kind of same.

4030
03:12:32,191 --> 03:12:36,350
You get used to like I have a place on 
my cheek where I put my point,

4031
03:12:36,600 --> 03:12:39,570
the anchor point changes cause the 
goggles right up here.

4032
03:12:39,720 --> 03:12:43,860
So you have to get a new anchor point.
But it's still pretty fucking fun.

4033
03:12:44,250 --> 03:12:48,600
I mean how often you get to shoot at 
things in and like an archery range like

4034
03:12:48,601 --> 03:12:49,350
this?
Yeah,

4035
03:12:49,350 --> 03:12:51,120
this is wild.
And I wonder,

4036
03:12:51,180 --> 03:12:52,010
that means it should

4037
03:12:52,010 --> 03:12:55,730
definitely be able to do something like 
this for a compound bows.

4038
03:12:56,180 --> 03:12:59,660
That's say go deer hunting with it.
There's another archery program that you

4039
03:12:59,661 --> 03:13:02,030
can get on steam that it looks pretty 
cool.

4040
03:13:02,410 --> 03:13:03,950
Uh,
I can't remember the name of it though,

4041
03:13:03,951 --> 03:13:06,770
but it looks a little bit more,
I guess,

4042
03:13:06,771 --> 03:13:07,850
realistic.
Well,

4043
03:13:07,851 --> 03:13:08,684
they have an archery program.
See if you could find this archery 

4044
03:13:10,101 --> 03:13:13,010
program where you shoot at a virtual 
screen,

4045
03:13:13,040 --> 03:13:15,590
you actually shoot a real bow at,
uh,

4046
03:13:15,591 --> 03:13:17,900
these images on a screen.
And this,

4047
03:13:17,901 --> 03:13:19,110
uh,
like you,

4048
03:13:19,140 --> 03:13:19,973
you go to like in front of like a giant 
movie theater type thing and you stand 

4049
03:13:22,941 --> 03:13:24,950
in front of this thing and these animals
walked by.

4050
03:13:25,010 --> 03:13:25,551
I,
that's cool.

4051
03:13:25,551 --> 03:13:26,384
And they run from you and they hide and 
you got to sneak up on them and shoot 

4052
03:13:29,121 --> 03:13:29,954
arrows at them.
I mean I'm sure this will be translated 

4053
03:13:31,731 --> 03:13:34,250
into vr and I'll tell you joe,
if I was,

4054
03:13:34,251 --> 03:13:37,130
if I were you man,
I would be developing shit for Vr.

4055
03:13:37,130 --> 03:13:37,963
Right?
Developing.

4056
03:13:38,170 --> 03:13:39,440
Yeah.
God Damn it.

4057
03:13:39,441 --> 03:13:41,150
It's not a developer.
I would,

4058
03:13:41,410 --> 03:13:44,000
I,
there's so many ideas that you will have

4059
03:13:44,001 --> 03:13:46,490
when you try these goggles on where 
you're going to be like this,

4060
03:13:46,670 --> 03:13:50,360
this needs to exist in the world,
get this shit developed man.

4061
03:13:50,361 --> 03:13:55,050
Because it's gonna like there's so many 
things that once you experience it where

4062
03:13:55,080 --> 03:13:55,913
like Oh someone needs to build this.
Someone like for example a fucking 

4063
03:13:59,181 --> 03:14:01,540
boxing,
Jamie's nodding in the,

4064
03:14:01,560 --> 03:14:04,040
in the one hour I think I got a 
demonstration of it.

4065
03:14:04,041 --> 03:14:04,874
I was just sitting there asking the guy,
so what about when someone gets a hold 

4066
03:14:07,581 --> 03:14:08,414
of this and they start thinking about 
doing this thing and what about when 

4067
03:14:10,340 --> 03:14:11,173
rock star gets it and then they start 
thinking about making grand theft auto 

4068
03:14:13,281 --> 03:14:13,761
this way.
It's like,

4069
03:14:13,761 --> 03:14:15,890
yes Zach,
your brain just steak.

4070
03:14:16,180 --> 03:14:17,013
Well fallout is coming for the vive,
which is going to be pretty fucking 

4071
03:14:19,851 --> 03:14:20,360
cool.

4072
03:14:20,360 --> 03:14:21,193
But dude from the,
and they have like a a boxing program 

4073
03:14:24,410 --> 03:14:25,243
that looks like it's still in 
development but a fucking real boxing 

4074
03:14:29,061 --> 03:14:33,230
program because it tracks the 
controllers perfectly in real time.

4075
03:14:33,260 --> 03:14:35,450
So you could actually learn how to box.
Yes.

4076
03:14:35,960 --> 03:14:40,130
Someone needs to build a real fun,
not only learn how to box,

4077
03:14:40,310 --> 03:14:43,790
but you could train with the great 
boxers like you could throw kicks to,

4078
03:14:44,000 --> 03:14:45,740
well you'd have to have something on 
your foot.

4079
03:14:45,770 --> 03:14:46,603
You'd have to have another edition.
It was like that could be done boots 

4080
03:14:48,951 --> 03:14:50,570
right.
Easily man.

4081
03:14:50,660 --> 03:14:54,050
Easily kind of sneakers that you get a 
great fucking workout too.

4082
03:14:54,140 --> 03:14:54,973
Oh I'm sure.
I remember when people were doing dance 

4083
03:14:56,151 --> 03:14:57,770
dance revolution.
They lost tons of weight.

4084
03:14:57,790 --> 03:14:58,623
Yeah,
there was a huge thing a lot of guys 

4085
03:15:00,111 --> 03:15:00,944
lost and gals lost a ton of weight off 
that dance dance revolution again cause 

4086
03:15:05,031 --> 03:15:06,020
it was so fun to do.

4087
03:15:06,440 --> 03:15:07,273
Well,
that's what's funny about Vr is that 

4088
03:15:08,991 --> 03:15:11,000
right now when people think of a video 
Gamer,

4089
03:15:11,600 --> 03:15:13,310
they don't,
you're not going to hear someone say,

4090
03:15:13,340 --> 03:15:14,173
Oh,
they are lean and Tan and they like her 

4091
03:15:15,710 --> 03:15:17,240
deck.
They have such dexterity.

4092
03:15:17,420 --> 03:15:21,380
But now when you think of someone who's 
great at Vr,

4093
03:15:21,860 --> 03:15:23,600
they're going to,
you gotta be in fucking Shit.

4094
03:15:23,840 --> 03:15:26,270
There's the boxing program.
I'm going to download it.

4095
03:15:26,271 --> 03:15:28,790
The creators of this,
or seem like they're super cool.

4096
03:15:29,180 --> 03:15:31,160
I think I could get a good workout with 
this.

4097
03:15:31,190 --> 03:15:32,570
They have vr pool.
How good.

4098
03:15:32,840 --> 03:15:36,080
I don't want that pools for real.
But see,

4099
03:15:36,081 --> 03:15:36,914
the thing about this is this is 
something that you could do on your own 

4100
03:15:39,231 --> 03:15:40,470
and get a workout in.
What I,

4101
03:15:40,550 --> 03:15:41,383
what I find interesting about this too 
is you could tune a dude up and you 

4102
03:15:44,271 --> 03:15:45,104
don't feel bad about it right now.
What you need to do eventually is 

4103
03:15:49,630 --> 03:15:50,010
they're going to

4104
03:15:50,010 --> 03:15:52,680
have something that looks like this,
but it's a robot.

4105
03:15:52,681 --> 03:15:53,514
Like both things.
Like you have a thing that you can 

4106
03:15:55,891 --> 03:15:56,630
actually hit.

4107
03:15:56,630 --> 03:15:58,400
Well now you could just,
you could already,

4108
03:15:58,880 --> 03:16:02,840
I'm sure there's a way that you could 
hang a bag and um,

4109
03:16:02,870 --> 03:16:03,471
cause like,
okay,

4110
03:16:03,471 --> 03:16:04,940
so when I,
um,

4111
03:16:05,720 --> 03:16:07,370
what I'm talking about southern the hits
back,

4112
03:16:07,940 --> 03:16:09,290
well yeah,
that's that,

4113
03:16:09,350 --> 03:16:11,410
that's going to be something that 
phrase,

4114
03:16:11,440 --> 03:16:12,273
it doesn't have to have a lot of power.
They could have like a really mushy arm 

4115
03:16:16,030 --> 03:16:20,020
and it knows how to move the way,
the way you move,

4116
03:16:20,100 --> 03:16:20,360
like

4117
03:16:20,360 --> 03:16:23,090
Zach's a throwing punches at you.
So if it hits you,

4118
03:16:23,091 --> 03:16:24,950
it's not hurting you.
You know what that could be,

4119
03:16:24,951 --> 03:16:25,784
man.
It can be like a haptic face mask that 

4120
03:16:28,071 --> 03:16:32,420
registers the punch and vibrates so that
you could feel it,

4121
03:16:32,540 --> 03:16:34,340
you know,
and wherever it hits you,

4122
03:16:34,480 --> 03:16:34,880
it could

4123
03:16:34,880 --> 03:16:37,730
be,
but it also could be like some sort of a

4124
03:16:37,731 --> 03:16:42,731
robot that has inflatable arms and the 
inflatable arms move with the program.

4125
03:16:43,940 --> 03:16:46,610
So as you're looking at Apollo creed in 
front of you,

4126
03:16:46,700 --> 03:16:49,300
when he snaps his jab out at you pop,
he's,

4127
03:16:49,330 --> 03:16:50,163
he's throwing this like spongy,
almost like a inflatable raft balloon 

4128
03:16:56,511 --> 03:16:57,111
arm.
You know,

4129
03:16:57,111 --> 03:17:00,230
like when you're little kids inflatable 
balloon toys.

4130
03:17:00,370 --> 03:17:01,270
Yeah,
I like that.

4131
03:17:01,300 --> 03:17:02,290
Like,
he's not going to hurt you at all.

4132
03:17:02,291 --> 03:17:04,720
It's just going to touch your face.
Be fucking incredible.

4133
03:17:04,850 --> 03:17:06,940
And what's in,
what you're going to see,

4134
03:17:06,941 --> 03:17:07,774
man,
is people are going to get really good 

4135
03:17:08,681 --> 03:17:09,514
at this shit.
Like if you're good at shooting and vr 

4136
03:17:11,830 --> 03:17:12,663
minus like the heft of the gun and the 
real kick of whatever gun in the real 

4137
03:17:14,951 --> 03:17:16,250
world.
Are you using your,

4138
03:17:16,251 --> 03:17:17,950
it's,
it's going to translate.

4139
03:17:18,100 --> 03:17:21,610
We are tomorrow and just float in 
Pasadena.

4140
03:17:22,140 --> 03:17:23,360
Um,
Zach,

4141
03:17:23,380 --> 03:17:28,240
Larry and I are testing out,
I think for the first time Vr in a float

4142
03:17:28,241 --> 03:17:31,890
tank and Zach leary,
Timothy leary's son Timothy leary.

4143
03:17:31,980 --> 03:17:36,070
Are you up to Duncan trussell Oh,
you dropping out and tuning in and we're

4144
03:17:36,071 --> 03:17:39,370
trying to induce the observer effect.
We've got this awesome guy,

4145
03:17:39,371 --> 03:17:40,510
Dustin,
who's,

4146
03:17:40,511 --> 03:17:41,560
uh,
helped us,

4147
03:17:41,561 --> 03:17:44,710
um,
help helped us build a floating in space

4148
03:17:44,711 --> 03:17:47,170
program.
So the idea is,

4149
03:17:47,500 --> 03:17:48,333
can you like induced the effect 
astronauts report when they're floating 

4150
03:17:52,331 --> 03:17:54,460
in space looking down on earth.
If you,

4151
03:17:54,530 --> 03:17:55,363
if you put someone in the zero g or the 
Semis Erg of a float tank and give them 

4152
03:18:00,401 --> 03:18:01,234
the impression that they're staring down
on planet earth and we've got this 

4153
03:18:04,270 --> 03:18:06,880
genius designer is,
I haven't looked at it yet.

4154
03:18:07,180 --> 03:18:10,150
You are freaking me the fuck out right 
now.

4155
03:18:10,180 --> 03:18:11,013
Well let's hope it works man.
I mean this is something that makes 

4156
03:18:12,671 --> 03:18:15,850
sense to me in my world.
The world of the float.

4157
03:18:15,970 --> 03:18:18,130
Yeah man.
We'll know like something like that,

4158
03:18:18,131 --> 03:18:19,750
like adding floating to it.
You know,

4159
03:18:19,751 --> 03:18:22,660
crash was trying to do something similar
a long time ago.

4160
03:18:22,900 --> 03:18:23,733
He was developing programs.
He developed a screen crash from the 

4161
03:18:26,891 --> 03:18:27,820
float lab,
I should say.

4162
03:18:27,821 --> 03:18:31,510
He's the one of the big innovators have 
a floating tanks in this country.

4163
03:18:31,511 --> 03:18:32,344
He developed a screen that had one of 
the lowest emissions of light possible 

4164
03:18:35,920 --> 03:18:38,650
so that when you be lying down in this 
tank,

4165
03:18:38,890 --> 03:18:39,723
complete darkness,
you would look up at the screen and the 

4166
03:18:41,921 --> 03:18:42,754
amount of light came out.
It was so minuscule that allowed you to 

4167
03:18:44,531 --> 03:18:48,010
see clearly the images but didn't show a
the line of

4168
03:18:48,010 --> 03:18:50,860
a screen.
So you were never removed from this idea

4169
03:18:50,861 --> 03:18:52,180
that you're floating through the 
universe,

4170
03:18:52,181 --> 03:18:53,014
but in front of you while these things 
are playing out and he had this idea 

4171
03:18:55,510 --> 03:18:57,250
that you would learn things easier that 
way.

4172
03:18:57,400 --> 03:19:00,150
Like you could watch like a golf 
documentary or a golf,

4173
03:19:00,151 --> 03:19:00,984
a instructional rather,
and you could learn like how to swing a 

4174
03:19:02,951 --> 03:19:03,784
golf club properly because you would be 
seeing it through a first person 

4175
03:19:07,001 --> 03:19:07,834
perspective.

4176
03:19:07,920 --> 03:19:08,790
Well,
um,

4177
03:19:08,910 --> 03:19:13,260
Zach's dad had this idea,
I think it's called the Timothy leary.

4178
03:19:13,290 --> 03:19:16,590
Tim leary probably say who his dad was.
Tim Timothy.

4179
03:19:16,620 --> 03:19:19,480
Timothy leary had this idea of the eight
circuits of clothes.

4180
03:19:19,760 --> 03:19:21,070
Zach's dad.
Yeah,

4181
03:19:21,071 --> 03:19:22,800
maybe sweetie.
Well,

4182
03:19:22,830 --> 03:19:25,230
I mean any w and he was a fucking 
sweetie.

4183
03:19:25,231 --> 03:19:28,350
Tim leary was like Tim Timothy leary 
was,

4184
03:19:29,430 --> 03:19:31,680
he was,
I put them on the same level as Galileo.

4185
03:19:31,681 --> 03:19:32,514
He was an incredibly brilliant human 
being and a lot of his ideas got lost 

4186
03:19:35,971 --> 03:19:39,570
and is like he,
he gets called an lsd propagandist,

4187
03:19:39,720 --> 03:19:42,060
but there's a lot of other shit he was 
coming up with.

4188
03:19:42,300 --> 03:19:43,133
And I'm one of those was this model,
I think it's the eight circuits of 

4189
03:19:46,111 --> 03:19:46,944
consciousness.
So the idea is that humans are meant to 

4190
03:19:51,301 --> 03:19:52,134
migrate into space.
And that in the same way like different 

4191
03:19:54,841 --> 03:19:58,320
creatures,
when they enter into new habitats,

4192
03:19:58,410 --> 03:20:00,120
they actually change a little bit.

4193
03:20:00,180 --> 03:20:01,260
There's,
or in other words,

4194
03:20:01,261 --> 03:20:06,261
like you take a a sea turtle,
he's laid eggs in the sand and the first

4195
03:20:06,901 --> 03:20:07,734
time a little baby sea turtle climbs out
of the egg and burroughs out of the 

4196
03:20:11,251 --> 03:20:12,084
sand.
It's a land creature until it hits 

4197
03:20:14,521 --> 03:20:15,354
water.
And then all of a sudden all of this 

4198
03:20:16,501 --> 03:20:19,800
other instinctual shit kicks in and it 
learns how to be a sea turtle.

4199
03:20:19,980 --> 03:20:22,380
More than likely it gets eaten.
Not a lot of them make it,

4200
03:20:22,620 --> 03:20:25,200
but the ones that survive become sea 
turtles.

4201
03:20:25,201 --> 03:20:26,034
Right?
So,

4202
03:20:26,040 --> 03:20:29,880
so the idea is that humans are meant for
interstellar,

4203
03:20:29,970 --> 03:20:30,740
for,
for tr,

4204
03:20:30,740 --> 03:20:31,573
for travel in space,
and that if we go into zero g then over 

4205
03:20:36,720 --> 03:20:39,660
what could potentially happen,
uh,

4206
03:20:39,930 --> 03:20:44,930
our changes in our psyche and maybe even
in our genetic makeup,

4207
03:20:45,691 --> 03:20:48,120
like maybe if we go into space long 
enough,

4208
03:20:48,330 --> 03:20:53,010
we'll start transforming into some new 
creature that we were meant to be.

4209
03:20:53,011 --> 03:20:53,440
So

4210
03:20:53,440 --> 03:20:54,273
was it ed Mitchell that was talking 
about the experience of being in space 

4211
03:20:58,151 --> 03:20:58,984
that he would like to take everybody up 
there and that you would realize how 

4212
03:21:01,931 --> 03:21:05,560
ridiculous boundaries are and how 
ridiculous wars are.

4213
03:21:05,830 --> 03:21:08,050
If you could see the earth as a whole,
the way he saw it

4214
03:21:08,130 --> 03:21:10,290
at Mitchell,
is he still alive?

4215
03:21:11,240 --> 03:21:12,073
I believe he is Mitchell or trying to do
it for your brother and mental is not 

4216
03:21:14,871 --> 03:21:15,471
alive.
No,

4217
03:21:15,471 --> 03:21:16,230
he died.
Ah,

4218
03:21:16,230 --> 03:21:18,920
well what was a,
he was an interesting guy.

4219
03:21:18,980 --> 03:21:21,500
He was an interesting one because he was
really into Ufos,

4220
03:21:22,040 --> 03:21:22,873
especially before he died.
He was one of the more compelling cases 

4221
03:21:25,970 --> 03:21:30,970
of someone who went into space and came 
back with a profound belief in Ufos.

4222
03:21:32,180 --> 03:21:34,970
But you know,
it's always hard.

4223
03:21:34,971 --> 03:21:36,620
You don't know the guy.
I don't know the guy.

4224
03:21:36,621 --> 03:21:39,290
I don't know what his motivation was.
I hope he was being honest.

4225
03:21:39,590 --> 03:21:40,423
But there's a lot of money and you lfos 
if you're a fucking astronaut and you 

4226
03:21:43,101 --> 03:21:45,140
want to cash in,
that's the best way.

4227
03:21:45,230 --> 03:21:46,160
I'm not,
I'm not saying

4228
03:21:46,160 --> 03:21:47,600
that he would do it.
I'm not saying that,

4229
03:21:47,630 --> 03:21:50,570
but the cynic in me has to always go,
well,

4230
03:21:50,571 --> 03:21:52,340
how well do they take care of their 
astronauts?

4231
03:21:52,370 --> 03:21:53,930
I mean,
how well did they get?

4232
03:21:54,000 --> 03:21:54,833
I'll tell you what,
man,

4233
03:21:54,920 --> 03:21:57,440
if you can tap into some of that sweet,
sweet ufo money,

4234
03:21:59,240 --> 03:22:00,980
it's a lot of money in them.
UFO books,

4235
03:22:01,190 --> 03:22:03,950
little green men.
I want little green bits of paper,

4236
03:22:03,951 --> 03:22:05,030
motherfucker.
I mean,

4237
03:22:05,031 --> 03:22:07,010
it's not like Hillary Clinton speaking 
fees.

4238
03:22:07,160 --> 03:22:07,993
But if you can get a former us 
astronauts who went to the moon to sit 

4239
03:22:12,141 --> 03:22:16,730
down and talk to you about the little 
green men that he might have seen or the

4240
03:22:16,731 --> 03:22:18,170
idea that they might exist.

4241
03:22:19,340 --> 03:22:19,941
Well,
you know what,

4242
03:22:19,941 --> 03:22:20,550
man,
you,

4243
03:22:20,550 --> 03:22:23,690
you know,
there are nefarious people in this world

4244
03:22:23,840 --> 03:22:27,670
and I don't know if fucking had Mitchell
I saw Ufo is or not.

4245
03:22:27,671 --> 03:22:30,580
It wouldn't surprise me that there are,
uh,

4246
03:22:30,600 --> 03:22:33,590
other creatures that you run into up 
there that for whatever reason,

4247
03:22:33,591 --> 03:22:36,400
you're not supposed to announce,
I don't know man.

4248
03:22:36,740 --> 03:22:37,850
Totally possible.
Look,

4249
03:22:37,851 --> 03:22:38,684
if we could send a robot to Mars,
there's totally possible that 

4250
03:22:40,671 --> 03:22:41,504
something's up there.
It's totally possible that something is 

4251
03:22:43,341 --> 03:22:44,660
around the earth.
All the time.

4252
03:22:44,661 --> 03:22:45,890
We just don't get a chance to see it.

4253
03:22:46,470 --> 03:22:47,303
I mean,
this is what Terence Mckenna always 

4254
03:22:47,940 --> 03:22:48,773
talked about.
It's like we spent all this money on 

4255
03:22:49,651 --> 03:22:53,030
these telescopes when for however you 
don't even,

4256
03:22:53,130 --> 03:22:56,610
most people won't even sell you DMT.
They give it to you.

4257
03:22:56,790 --> 03:22:57,623
But like when you know,
just like however much it costs for 

4258
03:23:00,361 --> 03:23:01,194
whatever the device you use to inhale 
the DMT or however much the it cost you 

4259
03:23:05,161 --> 03:23:08,370
to get down to wherever the IOWASCA 
Sharman was or whatever it is,

4260
03:23:08,640 --> 03:23:09,473
you're going to encounter things that 
seem to have a personality that is not 

4261
03:23:13,980 --> 03:23:18,180
your personality and that they don't 
have a normal human body.

4262
03:23:18,450 --> 03:23:21,360
And you know,
I was just reading Alistair Crawley last

4263
03:23:21,360 --> 03:23:26,340
night and he's talking about,
we use the term angel,

4264
03:23:27,000 --> 03:23:30,870
not because we're saying there's some 
angel out there,

4265
03:23:31,320 --> 03:23:32,153
but it's more convenient than saying 
here is a representation of the higher 

4266
03:23:35,701 --> 03:23:40,701
form of human intelligence that is come 
and in the form of an archetype that our

4267
03:23:41,011 --> 03:23:44,730
brains translate as an angel.
It's just easier to call it an angel for

4268
03:23:44,731 --> 03:23:49,020
the sake of just pragmatism because you 
want to achieve some goal.

4269
03:23:49,170 --> 03:23:53,790
Just call it a fucking angel.
We used to call aliens angels.

4270
03:23:53,791 --> 03:23:54,870
That's what we used to call him.

4271
03:23:55,420 --> 03:24:00,420
The idea of a person with no possible 
way of measuring what something is,

4272
03:24:01,050 --> 03:24:02,850
even if,
whether you have an experience or not,

4273
03:24:02,851 --> 03:24:05,280
I have to take your word for it.
I'm assuming you had an experience,

4274
03:24:05,281 --> 03:24:08,880
you said it was an angel.
The idea of putting a label on that,

4275
03:24:08,940 --> 03:24:10,500
a definitive label like,
oh,

4276
03:24:10,501 --> 03:24:12,060
I definitely met an angel.
Right?

4277
03:24:12,061 --> 03:24:13,860
How the fuck do you know what an angel 
is?

4278
03:24:14,000 --> 03:24:15,270
Right?
How do you know it was an alien?

4279
03:24:15,600 --> 03:24:18,210
It was definitely an alien.
You sure it wasn't an angel?

4280
03:24:18,330 --> 03:24:19,920
How do you know?
You don't know.

4281
03:24:19,980 --> 03:24:20,920
You're guessing,
right?

4282
03:24:20,930 --> 03:24:22,560
You don't know what an angel is or an 
alien isn't.

4283
03:24:22,620 --> 03:24:25,200
As a matter of fact,
you shouldn't be able to say those words

4284
03:24:25,350 --> 03:24:26,183
because you don't even know what the 
fuck they mean either one of those 

4285
03:24:27,601 --> 03:24:28,950
words.
You're just saying nonsense.

4286
03:24:28,951 --> 03:24:31,080
And for you to be like super definitive 
about it.

4287
03:24:31,290 --> 03:24:31,861
Like you're,
you're,

4288
03:24:31,861 --> 03:24:32,694
you're,
you're definitely sure that it was an 

4289
03:24:34,021 --> 03:24:36,090
angel or you're definitely sure that it 
was an alien.

4290
03:24:36,300 --> 03:24:38,190
You're crazy.
You don't even know what you saw.

4291
03:24:38,220 --> 03:24:39,053
Well,
you don't have anything that you can 

4292
03:24:39,421 --> 03:24:40,254
bring back.
There's no physical matter where you 

4293
03:24:41,851 --> 03:24:42,684
brought to a scientist and bunch of peer
reviewed scientists from all over the 

4294
03:24:44,911 --> 03:24:48,240
world studied it and determined that 
this was actually alien tissue.

4295
03:24:48,420 --> 03:24:51,450
Now there's none of that.
So no matter what it is,

4296
03:24:51,750 --> 03:24:53,130
the labels ridiculous,

4297
03:24:53,230 --> 03:24:55,600
right?
And they get caught up in the label is,

4298
03:24:55,601 --> 03:24:59,140
is of to waste your time unless you're 
using the label is a,

4299
03:24:59,141 --> 03:24:59,974
is something to expedite your ability to
recontact that thing in which case 

4300
03:25:04,571 --> 03:25:07,810
labels are fantastic.
But if you're using the label to say,

4301
03:25:07,840 --> 03:25:09,370
Oh yes,
this is definitely an angel,

4302
03:25:09,640 --> 03:25:13,300
and then you're like getting in the most
insanely stupid arguments over that,

4303
03:25:13,570 --> 03:25:17,240
then it's a bit of a waste of time.
But if you have an experience,

4304
03:25:17,241 --> 03:25:18,580
for example,
I don't know,

4305
03:25:18,730 --> 03:25:19,563
you smoked dmt and you come into contact
with it's self transforming machine 

4306
03:25:24,071 --> 03:25:27,330
elves that as Terence Mckenna,
hyperspace and hyperspace,

4307
03:25:27,370 --> 03:25:30,280
right?
So is that really what those things call

4308
03:25:30,281 --> 03:25:32,020
themselves?
If they could?

4309
03:25:32,200 --> 03:25:33,190
No,
of course not.

4310
03:25:33,191 --> 03:25:38,191
But as a tool or a means of trying to in
some way bring the uh,

4311
03:25:39,700 --> 03:25:43,840
transcendent into this dimension,
then language is a,

4312
03:25:43,850 --> 03:25:45,640
is a necessity.
You have no choice.

4313
03:25:45,730 --> 03:25:48,010
Well not just that,
but in Mckenna's case it was part of the

4314
03:25:48,011 --> 03:25:53,011
grand theater of being someone who is a,
a dmt evangelist.

4315
03:25:53,120 --> 03:25:53,953
Right?
I mean,

4316
03:25:54,050 --> 03:25:58,180
part of his,
his art of what he is is a performer.

4317
03:25:58,270 --> 03:26:02,050
Like I'm a big fan of his lectures.
I enjoyed watching him talk,

4318
03:26:02,051 --> 03:26:02,884
I enjoyed listening to him talk,
but part of what he was doing was very 

4319
03:26:05,351 --> 03:26:08,410
entertaining.
He had this oddly soothing voice,

4320
03:26:08,620 --> 03:26:09,453
this brilliant vocabulary.
And one of the things he did in one of 

4321
03:26:11,651 --> 03:26:13,520
these interviews that he did a,
he was a,

4322
03:26:13,560 --> 03:26:14,393
not interviews rather a,
he's do q and a's with the audience 

4323
03:26:16,110 --> 03:26:18,460
would ask them questions about 
psychedelic drugs and things along those

4324
03:26:18,461 --> 03:26:19,720
lines.
Um,

4325
03:26:19,990 --> 03:26:21,970
someone was asking him something and he 
said,

4326
03:26:22,150 --> 03:26:22,841
you know,
they were like,

4327
03:26:22,841 --> 03:26:23,674
well,
what can you do and how do you 

4328
03:26:24,431 --> 03:26:27,310
differentiate and how do you keep from 
being arrested?

4329
03:26:27,310 --> 03:26:28,143
He goes,
well,

4330
03:26:29,050 --> 03:26:31,900
no,
I use big words,

4331
03:26:33,010 --> 03:26:33,730
you know,
and he's a,

4332
03:26:33,730 --> 03:26:36,250
he's a legitimate scholar.
And he's like,

4333
03:26:36,280 --> 03:26:40,270
if you come up with slogans like dropout
tune in,

4334
03:26:40,640 --> 03:26:42,370
like,
yeah,

4335
03:26:42,400 --> 03:26:45,430
he goes,
that's when they come and he goes,

4336
03:26:45,431 --> 03:26:48,400
I keep it low key.
I have these small meetings,

4337
03:26:48,401 --> 03:26:52,300
they rarely get over a thousand people.
And uh,

4338
03:26:52,330 --> 03:26:56,060
I use a lot of really big words and a,
I use the,

4339
03:26:56,140 --> 03:26:59,710
the richest vocabulary for description 
that I can muster up.

4340
03:26:59,740 --> 03:27:00,573
Right.
It was interesting because like you 

4341
03:27:01,391 --> 03:27:02,224
listen to,
and he's obviously like incredibly well 

4342
03:27:03,881 --> 03:27:04,810
educated,
right?

4343
03:27:04,990 --> 03:27:05,823
And incredibly knowledgeable about the 
actual physical compounds of all these 

4344
03:27:08,741 --> 03:27:09,574
different psychedelics and their 
mechanisms for interaction and the 

4345
03:27:12,820 --> 03:27:15,700
monoamine oxidase inhibitors.
And all these different things that he's

4346
03:27:15,701 --> 03:27:16,534
saying that are like,
it causes like people who are not that 

4347
03:27:18,641 --> 03:27:19,461
smart to go,
oh,

4348
03:27:19,461 --> 03:27:21,630
okay.
We let them

4349
03:27:21,700 --> 03:27:24,390
go.
Let him keep talking to her.

4350
03:27:24,620 --> 03:27:29,250
I hope to God they don't care that much 
about people talking about that stuff,

4351
03:27:29,251 --> 03:27:30,011
man.
It and I,

4352
03:27:30,011 --> 03:27:30,844
it's not,
they,

4353
03:27:30,910 --> 03:27:31,460
I don't know.
I don't

4354
03:27:31,460 --> 03:27:32,930
believe there's a day.
Don't,

4355
03:27:33,080 --> 03:27:35,990
there's a few people that are they,
but those few people that are,

4356
03:27:35,991 --> 03:27:38,390
they the,
they're bankers and their industrialists

4357
03:27:38,391 --> 03:27:39,224
and there the military industrial that 
people that are earning money off of 

4358
03:27:42,971 --> 03:27:43,804
wars and controlling resources,
if you really think that they are 

4359
03:27:46,361 --> 03:27:49,150
somehow or another actively trying to 
uh,

4360
03:27:49,320 --> 03:27:53,470
and capture or capture people that are 
talking openly about psychedelics,

4361
03:27:53,910 --> 03:27:54,910
they don't have time for that shit

4362
03:27:55,050 --> 03:27:56,520
either way,
if I really don't think they do.

4363
03:27:56,550 --> 03:28:00,570
Have you seen that video of Tim leary in
front of the Senate and a hearing

4364
03:28:00,850 --> 03:28:04,300
that was like 1960?
What was it?

4365
03:28:04,540 --> 03:28:05,230
I want to say it was like,

4366
03:28:05,230 --> 03:28:05,981
I don't know,
the year.

4367
03:28:05,981 --> 03:28:07,600
It's one of the funniest fucking things 
ever.

4368
03:28:07,601 --> 03:28:08,434
This is our cause he's a madman and he's
in front of these like just hardcore 

4369
03:28:12,881 --> 03:28:16,660
politicians talking about the LSD 
experience.

4370
03:28:16,730 --> 03:28:18,620
Do you think will get pulled off youtube
if we play that?

4371
03:28:19,360 --> 03:28:22,480
I think that's public fucking don't we 
own that?

4372
03:28:22,481 --> 03:28:23,310
Cause it's a s

4373
03:28:23,310 --> 03:28:25,110
it should,
it should be the,

4374
03:28:25,111 --> 03:28:27,630
it'd be a historical thing.
Well there's a,

4375
03:28:27,960 --> 03:28:31,430
there's a amount of time things have to 
right.

4376
03:28:31,930 --> 03:28:33,220
I don't know.
Public domain,

4377
03:28:33,240 --> 03:28:35,500
if it's like video,
I guess it depends on who filmed that.

4378
03:28:35,501 --> 03:28:38,420
Like if it's as a TV station filmed it,
it's there.

4379
03:28:38,421 --> 03:28:39,254
It's,
but if it's like the government filming 

4380
03:28:40,631 --> 03:28:43,540
it,
I don't know for sure.

4381
03:28:43,541 --> 03:28:45,490
Like,
I don't know.

4382
03:28:46,090 --> 03:28:47,710
You've seen video of it.
Yeah,

4383
03:28:47,711 --> 03:28:49,780
there's definitely video footage and 
it's on it.

4384
03:28:49,990 --> 03:28:53,800
There's a documentary right now called 
dying to know,

4385
03:28:54,130 --> 03:28:56,890
which is an amazing movie about,
um,

4386
03:28:57,410 --> 03:28:58,243
Ron doss and Timothy leary's friendship 
and it sort of follows the scope of 

4387
03:29:02,240 --> 03:29:03,850
their lives together.
It's amazing.

4388
03:29:03,851 --> 03:29:05,120
It's fucking,
well,

4389
03:29:05,410 --> 03:29:07,190
well shot,
but it's real,

4390
03:29:07,210 --> 03:29:08,230
but it's,
it's on there.

4391
03:29:08,231 --> 03:29:10,450
I'm surprised it's not.
Um,

4392
03:29:11,200 --> 03:29:12,033
not anyways,

4393
03:29:13,150 --> 03:29:13,983
before I forget this again,
this is another thing they want to talk 

4394
03:29:15,551 --> 03:29:18,010
about earlier.
When you know the Fermi paradox,

4395
03:29:18,740 --> 03:29:21,290
what were all the aliens if 
civilization.

4396
03:29:21,291 --> 03:29:25,000
So likely yes.
Do you think looking at all this virtual

4397
03:29:25,001 --> 03:29:26,380
reality,
and this is something I explored,

4398
03:29:26,410 --> 03:29:27,243
I did a single podcast the other day 
with just me answering questions and 

4399
03:29:30,190 --> 03:29:31,023
somebody asks about the Fermi paradox 
and it really made me think about it 

4400
03:29:32,830 --> 03:29:34,630
even more and I've been thinking about 
it since then.

4401
03:29:35,350 --> 03:29:36,183
Do you think it's possible that 
civilizations never get to travel 

4402
03:29:38,741 --> 03:29:40,540
through space because they get to this 
thing,

4403
03:29:41,110 --> 03:29:43,180
they realize that the real juice is in 
virtual?

4404
03:29:43,181 --> 03:29:44,014
Like why do you have to like physically 
Trev traverse between one galaxy to 

4405
03:29:47,081 --> 03:29:47,914
another when you could figure out a way 
through technology and ultimately 

4406
03:29:51,041 --> 03:29:51,874
through artificial intelligence creating
infinitely more complex artificial 

4407
03:29:56,291 --> 03:29:59,290
reality that we're going to never 
travel,

4408
03:29:59,620 --> 03:30:02,200
all of our travel is going to be done 
internally.

4409
03:30:02,600 --> 03:30:03,061
Well,
yeah,

4410
03:30:03,061 --> 03:30:03,894
I do.
I think that that that is a great 

4411
03:30:05,671 --> 03:30:09,090
response to the Fermi paradox.
And I think that um,

4412
03:30:09,150 --> 03:30:09,983
w w our addiction to the idea that we 
are our body is going to be something 

4413
03:30:15,511 --> 03:30:16,344
that fades away over time and that we 
stop having this concept that I'm 

4414
03:30:20,401 --> 03:30:23,330
localized in my,
that my visit there.

4415
03:30:23,340 --> 03:30:24,173
You know,
we live in a world where people believe 

4416
03:30:26,281 --> 03:30:29,460
that all they are is their body.
They think I am my physical body.

4417
03:30:29,461 --> 03:30:30,660
That's it.
That's what I am.

4418
03:30:30,661 --> 03:30:33,330
That's the sum total of meat inside,
outside,

4419
03:30:33,630 --> 03:30:35,370
inside,
body,

4420
03:30:35,640 --> 03:30:37,350
outside,
everything else.

4421
03:30:37,590 --> 03:30:39,240
Even though what we were talking about 
earlier,

4422
03:30:39,680 --> 03:30:44,680
we know that we're inextricably woven in
to the fabric of every single thing.

4423
03:30:45,411 --> 03:30:50,411
So really your body is one part of the 
infinite universe and right now you have

4424
03:30:50,961 --> 03:30:54,440
become completely fixated on it.
You think it's you.

4425
03:30:54,620 --> 03:30:58,340
So vr,
you put vr on first thing that happens,

4426
03:30:58,341 --> 03:31:01,130
which is one of my favorite things is 
you'll hold your,

4427
03:31:01,820 --> 03:31:03,320
you'll hold your hand up in front of 
your face,

4428
03:31:03,321 --> 03:31:05,760
right?
And if you have the htc vive,

4429
03:31:05,761 --> 03:31:08,450
you'll see their amazing controllers is 
floating in the air.

4430
03:31:08,690 --> 03:31:12,800
But then you'll look down.
There's no fucking body there,

4431
03:31:12,801 --> 03:31:13,634
man.
You're looking down and it's just a 

4432
03:31:14,601 --> 03:31:17,480
blank space.
You don't have a body anymore.

4433
03:31:17,690 --> 03:31:18,523
Now when someone touches you in Vr,
it's really fucking cool because you 

4434
03:31:22,101 --> 03:31:25,160
don't see him.
It's like a ghost is touching you,

4435
03:31:25,490 --> 03:31:28,970
and I'm not saying I've done this,
but if you were to have sex in Vr,

4436
03:31:29,900 --> 03:31:32,030
you've done it.
Never Joe,

4437
03:31:32,060 --> 03:31:34,340
have you done?
We'll never have sex out of wedlock.

4438
03:31:34,640 --> 03:31:35,473
But if you were to have sex in Vr,
then suddenly you don't have a body 

4439
03:31:40,521 --> 03:31:41,690
anymore.
Okay,

4440
03:31:41,691 --> 03:31:43,660
but you're having sex in vr with another
person.

4441
03:31:43,661 --> 03:31:45,170
Who's your vr with another person?

4442
03:31:45,540 --> 03:31:48,600
Physical sex with someone.
And what do you see on the other side?

4443
03:31:48,670 --> 03:31:50,770
It depends on what you decided to be 
having sex.

4444
03:31:50,920 --> 03:31:51,753
And so you could,
you get up sex with your girlfriend and 

4445
03:31:53,981 --> 03:31:55,780
pretend it's like the cookie monster.

4446
03:31:56,500 --> 03:31:57,333
You could have sex with your girlfriend 
and just be laying a on in some field 

4447
03:32:00,581 --> 03:32:01,690
looking up at the stars.

4448
03:32:02,010 --> 03:32:02,843
Cookie Monster's feet up in the air like
bugs bunny and you're banging in the 

4449
03:32:06,031 --> 03:32:06,410
ass.

4450
03:32:06,410 --> 03:32:07,460
Here's what's weird,
man.

4451
03:32:07,490 --> 03:32:10,160
This is what's really weird and no one 
understands it.

4452
03:32:10,370 --> 03:32:13,400
But with Vr,
apparently people have tried it for some

4453
03:32:13,401 --> 03:32:14,234
reason they can't do that.
There's no way to bring the cookie 

4454
03:32:17,181 --> 03:32:20,960
monster to fuck the cookie monster.
Put a man on the moon.

4455
03:32:20,961 --> 03:32:23,150
We could fuck the cookie monster.
Absolutely man,

4456
03:32:23,330 --> 03:32:24,710
you could.
You could do that.

4457
03:32:25,820 --> 03:32:27,680
You could definitely do that.
But,

4458
03:32:28,160 --> 03:32:28,993
but it's,
it's kind of like something about the 

4459
03:32:32,630 --> 03:32:36,440
philosophical implications of not having
a body.

4460
03:32:36,530 --> 03:32:38,810
Even if it's being induced by 
technology.

4461
03:32:39,140 --> 03:32:39,973
I'm sure you've taken a high enough dose
of something where you merge into the 

4462
03:32:43,281 --> 03:32:46,100
universe and you feel like you don't 
have a self anymore.

4463
03:32:46,101 --> 03:32:46,980
You should.
It become,

4464
03:32:47,210 --> 03:32:48,043
so to imagine being able to induce that 
with Vr so that now you've removed the 

4465
03:32:53,181 --> 03:32:55,610
thing that you've been identifying with 
your entire life.

4466
03:32:55,611 --> 03:32:58,760
Your body is yourself and there's just a
blank space.

4467
03:32:58,970 --> 03:32:59,803
Yet consciousness remains.
Even though you know you have a body 

4468
03:33:02,500 --> 03:33:03,830
under,
when you take the goggles off,

4469
03:33:03,831 --> 03:33:06,560
you know it's there.
As time passes,

4470
03:33:06,561 --> 03:33:09,500
when you're wearing this shit,
you begin to forget about there.

4471
03:33:09,820 --> 03:33:11,900
You're going to forget about the 
external world.

4472
03:33:12,200 --> 03:33:14,300
And,
and when you finally do take the goggles

4473
03:33:14,301 --> 03:33:14,780
off,
it's like,

4474
03:33:14,780 --> 03:33:16,610
oh,
oh fuck,

4475
03:33:17,030 --> 03:33:18,620
oh right,
this is my office.

4476
03:33:18,650 --> 03:33:19,710
This is,
it's the same

4477
03:33:19,710 --> 03:33:22,320
thing that happens in some ways when you
get in a tank,

4478
03:33:23,040 --> 03:33:26,130
when you're in the tank with no vr 
technology,

4479
03:33:26,131 --> 03:33:30,720
you sometimes have experiences where you
go into like a dream state and you think

4480
03:33:30,721 --> 03:33:31,554
things are happening that aren't really 
happening and then you wake up out of 

4481
03:33:33,571 --> 03:33:34,810
them and you're in the tank,
right.

4482
03:33:35,040 --> 03:33:36,900
And they happen in a crazy,
vivid way.

4483
03:33:37,170 --> 03:33:39,960
You don't have any sensory input.
You're not,

4484
03:33:40,230 --> 03:33:42,900
you're not feeling that.
Like if you have a dream,

4485
03:33:43,120 --> 03:33:45,630
you're still feeling the bed most of the
time.

4486
03:33:45,631 --> 03:33:49,470
Like you're out of that stage and you're
in this dream dimension.

4487
03:33:49,680 --> 03:33:50,513
But if for some reason you moved a 
little bit and you hit your pillow or 

4488
03:33:52,711 --> 03:33:53,544
your,
your foot touch the nightstand or 

4489
03:33:54,421 --> 03:33:56,220
something like that,
you're going to snap out of it.

4490
03:33:56,400 --> 03:33:58,860
We ain't that God damn tank.
You don't feel anything.

4491
03:33:58,890 --> 03:34:01,170
Yeah.
You're flying through space already.

4492
03:34:01,230 --> 03:34:02,063
That's it.
So you can almost like use that as a 

4493
03:34:05,210 --> 03:34:08,370
homemade virtual reality thing.
Absolutely.

4494
03:34:08,790 --> 03:34:12,850
But the ability to program is where 
things get squirrely.

4495
03:34:12,860 --> 03:34:13,693
Yeah.
The ability to create any sort of 

4496
03:34:15,721 --> 03:34:17,160
scenario you would like.

4497
03:34:17,240 --> 03:34:18,380
Yeah.
It's the best.

4498
03:34:18,500 --> 03:34:21,620
It's going to have so many therapeutic 
uses.

4499
03:34:22,040 --> 03:34:23,840
What haptic feedback.
Yeah,

4500
03:34:23,841 --> 03:34:24,674
man,
it's big.

4501
03:34:24,710 --> 03:34:25,900
It's,
it's like haptic.

4502
03:34:25,901 --> 03:34:26,860
So like,
you know,

4503
03:34:26,870 --> 03:34:27,703
one impossible end result could be full 
bodied haptic suits in float tanks in 

4504
03:34:32,511 --> 03:34:36,680
the float tank can go just came.
Well yeah,

4505
03:34:36,681 --> 03:34:37,760
it's,
it's one,

4506
03:34:37,761 --> 03:34:39,860
it's one of the potential uses of the 
thing.

4507
03:34:39,861 --> 03:34:41,420
I mean fuck yeah.
All the,

4508
03:34:41,450 --> 03:34:44,480
there's just so much like just there's 
just so much it's going to be able to,

4509
03:34:44,770 --> 03:34:45,650
it's going to have,
I mean,

4510
03:34:45,860 --> 03:34:48,950
one thing I really hope people do is,
um,

4511
03:34:48,951 --> 03:34:49,784
and I was thinking about doing this man,
but like I always think about doing 

4512
03:34:52,490 --> 03:34:53,840
things like this,
I never do it.

4513
03:34:53,841 --> 03:34:54,674
So maybe one of you guys out there,
I'll do it as like bringing this shit 

4514
03:34:57,770 --> 03:34:58,603
old senior citizens homes and letting 
people who haven't experienced it who 

4515
03:35:03,501 --> 03:35:06,350
are maybe like not going to be in this 
dimension much longer,

4516
03:35:06,590 --> 03:35:07,423
have a chance to like Susan if you see 
what's going on because I think that'd 

4517
03:35:10,221 --> 03:35:12,020
be a great service for people.

4518
03:35:12,260 --> 03:35:13,940
People who are like,
uh,

4519
03:35:14,030 --> 03:35:14,863
paraplegics and hospitals to bring this 
technology to them and to let them 

4520
03:35:19,041 --> 03:35:20,750
experience,
you know,

4521
03:35:20,810 --> 03:35:21,643
the freedom for a little while if they 
can find that their hospital rooms when 

4522
03:35:25,431 --> 03:35:28,610
you,
there's so many weirdly anti vr people,

4523
03:35:28,611 --> 03:35:31,220
man,
even counting them.

4524
03:35:32,060 --> 03:35:33,470
I haven't seen anybody,
dude.

4525
03:35:33,471 --> 03:35:34,304
I was at,
uh,

4526
03:35:34,370 --> 03:35:35,091
well,
you know,

4527
03:35:35,091 --> 03:35:35,990
people are like,
Ugh,

4528
03:35:36,020 --> 03:35:37,700
vr.
I've already heard that.

4529
03:35:37,701 --> 03:35:38,690
Like,
you know,

4530
03:35:38,691 --> 03:35:39,860
it's gonna.
It's gonna.

4531
03:35:40,070 --> 03:35:42,530
It's like a,
it's like three d tv,

4532
03:35:42,860 --> 03:35:45,340
that kind of shit.
People have new students to this.

4533
03:35:45,341 --> 03:35:47,950
Just some Dick at a party.
There's no point talking about it.

4534
03:35:47,951 --> 03:35:51,140
I was trying to impress a girl.
There was no girl around maybe trying to

4535
03:35:51,141 --> 03:35:52,790
fuck you.
I fucked him.

4536
03:35:52,850 --> 03:35:53,683
Okay.
Did you take your three year old is 

4537
03:35:55,431 --> 03:35:56,930
really big.
You should nagging me.

4538
03:35:57,200 --> 03:35:58,370
But he was trying to like,
yeah,

4539
03:35:58,371 --> 03:36:00,330
he's probably uh,
trying to uh,

4540
03:36:00,440 --> 03:36:03,410
prod you or he didn't like the fact 
you're smarter than him.

4541
03:36:03,740 --> 03:36:05,540
It's,
I don't know if I was,

4542
03:36:05,541 --> 03:36:07,340
but I'll tell you,
it's going to be,

4543
03:36:07,940 --> 03:36:12,940
it's going to be one of the most 
powerful therapeutic tools,

4544
03:36:13,910 --> 03:36:15,710
uh,
that that's ever existed.

4545
03:36:15,711 --> 03:36:16,544
Just what it,
what it's going to be able to do just 

4546
03:36:17,871 --> 03:36:18,621
for like,
you know,

4547
03:36:18,621 --> 03:36:20,630
you hear about,
there was a great,

4548
03:36:21,170 --> 03:36:22,003
I think it was a vice article,
I can't remember which article about a 

4549
03:36:24,381 --> 03:36:29,240
guy who has to program the music that 
people listen to during the mushroom,

4550
03:36:29,690 --> 03:36:31,670
uh,
studies that they're doing.

4551
03:36:31,671 --> 03:36:32,504
Like what playlist do you play for 
someone who's undergoing psychedelic 

4552
03:36:35,381 --> 03:36:36,220
therapy?
Right?

4553
03:36:36,670 --> 03:36:39,490
But for this tool,
for psychedelic therapy,

4554
03:36:39,760 --> 03:36:41,980
like the ability to,
there's a program,

4555
03:36:42,280 --> 03:36:44,140
Oh my God,
when you come over,

4556
03:36:44,141 --> 03:36:48,280
I can't wait to show you this.
It's called sound self sound self.

4557
03:36:48,490 --> 03:36:53,490
And what it is is you put these goggles 
on and headphones that have a microphone

4558
03:36:54,191 --> 03:36:57,580
on and you chant into the thing,
right?

4559
03:36:57,610 --> 03:36:59,860
So you're like,
oh,

4560
03:37:00,120 --> 03:37:02,080
and it's true.
It takes,

4561
03:37:02,740 --> 03:37:03,551
that's it.
I mean,

4562
03:37:03,551 --> 03:37:04,450
again,
this stuff is,

4563
03:37:04,900 --> 03:37:05,733
it takes that responds to your sounds 
are making and then plays it back 

4564
03:37:09,911 --> 03:37:10,744
through your headphones.
So you're hear your voice being 

4565
03:37:13,121 --> 03:37:16,360
transformed and replaced is like deeper 
or lower.

4566
03:37:16,630 --> 03:37:18,250
It's just very psychedelic

4567
03:37:18,300 --> 03:37:19,133
and you're watching the images while 
you're hearing your voice that's being 

4568
03:37:21,750 --> 03:37:23,880
altered.
It's like you're doing rounds.

4569
03:37:30,930 --> 03:37:32,190
How many people are going to be saying 
that?

4570
03:37:32,191 --> 03:37:34,140
What's this guy's video?
So we could get them some views.

4571
03:37:34,800 --> 03:37:36,680
What does it say?
OCULUS rift games.

4572
03:37:36,681 --> 03:37:39,780
Sound self virtual reality.
Guinea pigs.

4573
03:37:39,960 --> 03:37:41,190
Yeah.
It's so cool.

4574
03:37:41,220 --> 03:37:43,620
God Damn.
And that's something if you,

4575
03:37:43,621 --> 03:37:44,560
if you guys out there,
I haven't,

4576
03:37:44,580 --> 03:37:45,660
oh my God,
look at that.

4577
03:37:47,500 --> 03:37:48,333
Well,
let's just,

4578
03:37:48,340 --> 03:37:49,173
yeah,
let's explain where we were watching 

4579
03:37:50,020 --> 03:37:50,853
were watching as these crazy three 
dimensional computer animations that 

4580
03:37:57,251 --> 03:37:59,520
look like they look like psychedelic 
trips.

4581
03:37:59,530 --> 03:38:01,640
It looks like almost like a gate,
whatnot,

4582
03:38:01,750 --> 03:38:04,180
dmt itself,
but like a gateway to dmt.

4583
03:38:04,390 --> 03:38:07,540
Like right before you blow through.
Like there's a moment,

4584
03:38:07,690 --> 03:38:08,523
there's a moment where you see like what
I think what they described as the 

4585
03:38:10,721 --> 03:38:13,990
flower of life before you blast on 
through to the other side.

4586
03:38:14,640 --> 03:38:15,890
Now,
uh,

4587
03:38:16,020 --> 03:38:19,230
for those of you have an htc vive,
if you want to use this game,

4588
03:38:19,780 --> 03:38:20,613
uh,
you can,

4589
03:38:20,710 --> 03:38:21,543
you can pay for the alpha.
It's 30 bucks cause goggles with the 

4590
03:38:25,500 --> 03:38:26,333
eyeballs and then you've got to use 
something called the revive injector to 

4591
03:38:30,121 --> 03:38:31,980
get it to run.
Anyone who has a five out there,

4592
03:38:31,981 --> 03:38:33,810
I'll know what I'm talking about cause 
like

4593
03:38:33,910 --> 03:38:34,743
what is the difference between a,
sorry to interrupt you but what does it 

4594
03:38:36,131 --> 03:38:37,630
different sheen,
oculus rift and the vive.

4595
03:38:37,960 --> 03:38:38,793
So unfortunately oculus has created,
has made a bunch of deals with the 

4596
03:38:44,230 --> 03:38:47,260
developers to make exclusive content for
the Oculus.

4597
03:38:47,261 --> 03:38:49,060
Right.
And oculus is great,

4598
03:38:49,180 --> 03:38:51,850
it's really cool.
But that was Oculus Oculus,

4599
03:38:51,970 --> 03:38:54,940
but it's not as good as the vibe for a 
few different reasons.

4600
03:38:55,270 --> 03:38:56,103
Uh,
one of the reasons is the vive is 

4601
03:38:57,791 --> 03:38:58,624
designed for being able to walk around.
The vibe comes with these and maybe the 

4602
03:39:02,651 --> 03:39:05,080
rift you can do it but it seems like 
it's more localized.

4603
03:39:05,200 --> 03:39:08,140
But the Mo and I said,
forgive me by the way,

4604
03:39:08,480 --> 03:39:10,360
Oculus rift people,
I love you,

4605
03:39:10,361 --> 03:39:11,430
carmax.
Coming on soon.

4606
03:39:11,500 --> 03:39:13,570
I had the dk one,
I had the dk two,

4607
03:39:13,710 --> 03:39:15,640
you know John Carmack from again 
software.

4608
03:39:15,700 --> 03:39:17,380
He's,
he's an oculus rift now.

4609
03:39:17,410 --> 03:39:18,243
Oculus is great and,
and God bless you guys for making vr 

4610
03:39:21,191 --> 03:39:22,024
possible because they were the ones of 
Palmer luckey ran with this fucking 

4611
03:39:25,451 --> 03:39:26,140
torch.

4612
03:39:26,140 --> 03:39:26,973
He like made this fucking happen.
The only problem is the oculus released 

4613
03:39:30,490 --> 03:39:33,230
without controllers like vive has.
Right.

4614
03:39:33,800 --> 03:39:36,380
And that was a big mistake.
So the boxing thing that we saw,

4615
03:39:36,381 --> 03:39:37,910
that was vibe,
that was five,

4616
03:39:38,090 --> 03:39:40,850
but oculus is releasing controllers now.
And honestly,

4617
03:39:41,030 --> 03:39:41,863
now that I'm getting so sucked into Vr,
I've actually considered buying an 

4618
03:39:45,081 --> 03:39:48,170
oculus rift just so I have both.
But you don't Christ,

4619
03:39:48,171 --> 03:39:48,950
dude,
you're deep.

4620
03:39:48,950 --> 03:39:50,720
You don't really need it because you 
can,

4621
03:39:50,721 --> 03:39:53,780
um,
use a something called revive,

4622
03:39:53,781 --> 03:39:56,990
which allows you to play Oculus Games on
the HTC vive.

4623
03:39:57,050 --> 03:39:59,450
You're so deep in this man.
It's weird to see.

4624
03:39:59,510 --> 03:40:02,050
It's the coolest fucking thing.
Just says this is the same.

4625
03:40:02,051 --> 03:40:02,110
Yeah.

4626
03:40:02,110 --> 03:40:02,943
Dock.
And that was terrified of everquest and 

4627
03:40:05,231 --> 03:40:07,810
world of warcraft and all that other 
shit that you got sucked into.

4628
03:40:07,811 --> 03:40:09,310
You're not terrified of this.
You're a,

4629
03:40:09,320 --> 03:40:12,240
you're just a whole hog diving right in 
here.

4630
03:40:12,250 --> 03:40:13,083
It feels right.

4631
03:40:19,070 --> 03:40:20,360
I love that expression.

4632
03:40:20,560 --> 03:40:22,780
It feels like the right thing.
It feels like,

4633
03:40:23,060 --> 03:40:24,130
and it's cool.
I'll tell you,

4634
03:40:24,131 --> 03:40:25,090
man,
by the way,

4635
03:40:25,510 --> 03:40:26,343
there's not a lot of people right now 
who have vr gear and there's just some 

4636
03:40:29,771 --> 03:40:34,771
kind of like exciting thing about same 
floor ground floor and being like,

4637
03:40:35,200 --> 03:40:38,560
oh my God,
this is going to change the world.

4638
03:40:38,640 --> 03:40:41,400
Let's do a podcast.
I'm from your place.

4639
03:40:41,430 --> 03:40:43,380
Let's do your podcast does.
Friday,

4640
03:40:43,381 --> 03:40:46,410
Doug and I are doing the Ice House in 
Pasadena on Friday night.

4641
03:40:46,411 --> 03:40:48,000
We're doing the eight o'clock show.
Sold out.

4642
03:40:48,001 --> 03:40:49,950
Sorry.
Um,

4643
03:40:49,980 --> 03:40:50,813
but we're going to do,
we'll do a podcast from your house and 

4644
03:40:52,831 --> 03:40:53,664
we'll do it with me experiencing your vr
for the first time and we'll keep 

4645
03:40:57,280 --> 03:40:58,113
barbecued.
I will try to things we were so high 

4646
03:41:00,001 --> 03:41:00,834
before the show.
I was worried if I was going to be able 

4647
03:41:02,011 --> 03:41:02,440
to pull it.

4648
03:41:02,440 --> 03:41:03,980
Man,
that breath spray paint,

4649
03:41:04,040 --> 03:41:08,180
playing around.
I was worried.

4650
03:41:08,650 --> 03:41:10,030
I was worried.
I was like,

4651
03:41:10,031 --> 03:41:10,870
oh no.
I went,

4652
03:41:11,290 --> 03:41:12,123
God,
I don't know if I can handle this one 

4653
03:41:14,380 --> 03:41:15,213
dude.
I did a podcast with Sam Harris and I 

4654
03:41:16,211 --> 03:41:18,880
took 12 shots of the breast spray for 
the podcast.

4655
03:41:19,600 --> 03:41:22,480
I wanted to see what would happen.
And I kept going.

4656
03:41:22,660 --> 03:41:26,020
And halfway to the podcast I was like,
oh my God.

4657
03:41:26,290 --> 03:41:28,460
It was like I was skiing down a hill.
Like on,

4658
03:41:28,461 --> 03:41:30,340
I was on a black diamond ski course.
I was,

4659
03:41:30,490 --> 03:41:34,210
I was up and I was moving and I was 
conscious and I knew just keep,

4660
03:41:34,240 --> 03:41:38,200
just keep paying attention to the road.
Liz left and right and left and right.

4661
03:41:38,201 --> 03:41:38,921
You're gonna,
you're gonna make it,

4662
03:41:38,921 --> 03:41:39,920
you're going to make it.
You don't make it.

4663
03:41:40,000 --> 03:41:44,020
Where do you get Jambo from?
Don't say the name out loud.

4664
03:41:44,610 --> 03:41:45,443
Yeah.
Yeah.

4665
03:41:45,460 --> 03:41:48,010
It's a girl has no name.
I'm sorry,

4666
03:41:48,011 --> 03:41:51,150
girl has no name.
She doesn't,

4667
03:41:51,160 --> 03:41:53,620
but I don't want to say it three times.
Like candy man in front of the mirror.

4668
03:41:55,340 --> 03:41:56,860
We'll talk

4669
03:42:00,840 --> 03:42:04,050
Friday night.
You mother fuckers.

4670
03:42:04,350 --> 03:42:04,891
So,
uh,

4671
03:42:04,891 --> 03:42:05,724
we'll be doing an episode of the Duncan 
trussell family hour chat with the Ice 

4672
03:42:08,280 --> 03:42:09,390
House upon my pleasure,
my brother.

4673
03:42:09,391 --> 03:42:11,550
I'll always love doing these.
We need to do these more often.

4674
03:42:11,551 --> 03:42:13,110
You know,
we're really good friends,

4675
03:42:13,290 --> 03:42:14,123
but we see each other and getting it,
get deeper with each other during these 

4676
03:42:17,281 --> 03:42:20,230
podcasts than we ever do in real life 
now.

4677
03:42:20,250 --> 03:42:21,360
Because if we,
in real life,

4678
03:42:21,390 --> 03:42:24,270
we would be talking to other people.
We'd be looking at our phone,

4679
03:42:24,271 --> 03:42:25,920
we'd be doing some other shit now

4680
03:42:26,800 --> 03:42:28,360
eating.
I love these moments,

4681
03:42:28,361 --> 03:42:29,194
Joe.
There are some of the happiest moments 

4682
03:42:30,021 --> 03:42:31,090
in my life,
so,

4683
03:42:31,170 --> 03:42:32,100
so grateful you let

4684
03:42:32,100 --> 03:42:34,440
me be on the show.
If I'm grateful that you're on it,

4685
03:42:34,441 --> 03:42:36,420
man.
But what I wanted to say was,

4686
03:42:36,540 --> 03:42:37,470
it's,
it's,

4687
03:42:37,471 --> 03:42:41,820
it's a fascinating thing because I never
would have imagined that we would get to

4688
03:42:41,821 --> 03:42:42,654
know each other better and deeper and 
more intensely by doing podcasts 

4689
03:42:47,341 --> 03:42:49,050
together with a whole world could hear 
it.

4690
03:42:49,190 --> 03:42:50,023
I mean,
you and I have had some crazy fucking 

4691
03:42:50,971 --> 03:42:53,460
conversations alone in private with 
just,

4692
03:42:53,461 --> 03:42:55,650
you and I are just talk to you about 
stuff for hours and hours,

4693
03:42:56,040 --> 03:42:58,710
but there's something crazy about doing 
these like this,

4694
03:42:59,070 --> 03:43:01,170
and we're doing our live and then we put
them out there.

4695
03:43:01,171 --> 03:43:02,220
They're,
they're fascinating,

4696
03:43:02,221 --> 03:43:03,900
man.
We got to do it more often.

4697
03:43:05,300 --> 03:43:07,350
Uh,
all right,

4698
03:43:07,351 --> 03:43:10,140
we'll be back tomorrow with a Wayne 
Fetterman,

4699
03:43:10,141 --> 03:43:11,640
my friend Wayne Fetterman.
Very funny.

4700
03:43:11,641 --> 03:43:13,890
Standup comic.
Neal Brennan's coming.

4701
03:43:14,220 --> 03:43:14,980
Uh,
it's,

4702
03:43:14,980 --> 03:43:18,180
it looked like it was going to be Gary 
Johnson and Stan hope on Thursday,

4703
03:43:18,181 --> 03:43:19,980
but it,
Gary Johnson might have to pull out.

4704
03:43:20,280 --> 03:43:25,200
He got to fly into Wednesday.
He's doing a town hall meeting on CNN,

4705
03:43:25,201 --> 03:43:27,360
which is big news because he's a third 
party candidate.

4706
03:43:27,510 --> 03:43:29,520
That's what happens.
People get sick of the two parties.

4707
03:43:29,780 --> 03:43:30,720
All right.
But,

4708
03:43:30,721 --> 03:43:31,620
uh,
we'll be back soon.

4709
03:43:31,621 --> 03:43:32,160
See Ya.

4710
03:43:32,160 --> 03:43:33,210
Bye.
Bye.

4711
03:43:46,180 --> 03:43:47,013
Yeah.
