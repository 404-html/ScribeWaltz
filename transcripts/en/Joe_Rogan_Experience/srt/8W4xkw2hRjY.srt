5
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:11,420
Greg Fitzsimmons and Ian and I were flying
home and we were at the terminal and

6
00:00:11,421 --> 00:00:12,920

apparently she's a stripper.

11
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:17,331

12
00:00:17,331 --> 00:00:17,690

13
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:18,141

14
00:00:18,141 --> 00:00:18,321
uh,

15
00:00:18,321 --> 00:00:20,900
we were sitting down having a coffee
and she asked if she could sit with us.

16
00:00:20,901 --> 00:00:21,041
I said,

17
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:21,290

18
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:21,650

Sit with us.

21
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:27,230
And so she started talking about working

22
00:00:27,231 --> 00:00:27,561

25
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:31,090

27

29
00:00:34,481 --> 00:00:35,314

30
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:38,090
And then she said she was
working with this girl.

31
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:40,280

37
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:48,620

I think her husband is her husband.

61
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,153
Well,

62
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,040

63
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,450

64
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:39,900

69
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:46,411

They did that when the
guy where he was like,

78

00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,540
I saw that and they were all clowning him.

81
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:10,350
Do you remember that?

82
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:12,480
They were all openly gay and they're like,

83
00:02:12,481 --> 00:02:12,691

84
00:02:12,691 --> 00:02:13,830

00:02:16,861 --> 00:02:18,030
They had a girlfriend too,

88
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,110
and his girlfriend was like,

89
00:02:19,111 --> 00:02:19,940
I don't like it,

90
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,060
but it's really his job.

91
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:25,280
And his Crawford was like kind of homely
and he's a good looking guy and he's a,

92
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,780

he had to say in the video,

00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,490
anal sex is the bomb.

94
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,530
That's when he had to
say before these years,

95
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,400
ran a train on them.

96
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,900

Look good.

158
00:04:14,861 --> 00:04:16,600
He wrote me after I tweeted it to him.

159
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:17,623
Oh

161
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:20,050
It's going to be lucrative.

162
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,680
We're both laughing about it on the plane.

163
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,340
We couldn't stop saying it.

164
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,750
How lucrative do you get,

165
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,400
cause I kept pretty low grid.

166

167
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:33,550
You mean lucrative?

168
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:39,080
It's really good to surround yourself
with people who inspire you because they,

169
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:41,860
they talk about having a cognitive
model for behavior change.

170
00:04:41,861 --> 00:04:44,170
Like if you're trying to
get better in some way,

171
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:45,130
uh,

172
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:46,240
if you can visual,

173
00:04:46,241 --> 00:04:49,480
if you know somebody who's already done
it or doing positive things in their

174
00:04:49,481 --> 00:04:50,170
lives,

175
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:50,650
it's,

176
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:54,250
it requires less energy for your
brain to imagine yourself doing it.

177
00:04:54,251 --> 00:04:54,570
Like if you're,

178
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:54,791
if you,

179
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:55,391
if you don't,

180
00:04:55,391 --> 00:04:57,760
if you're not trying to be anybody who's
trying to get healthy or trying to get

181
00:04:57,761 --> 00:04:58,900
fit or whatever it is,

182
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:00,010
you're,

183
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:00,400
it's like,

184
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,200
it's literally harder to imagine.

185
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:06,580
And so it's like more exhausting for
you to try to imagine yourself getting

186
00:05:06,581 --> 00:05:07,210
better.

187
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:09,250
Whereas if you're surrounded
by people who are doing it,

188
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,870
it becomes familiar to your brain.

189
00:05:10,871 --> 00:05:13,630
There's all sorts of examples
that your brain can call on.

190
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,050
Um,

191
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:18,250
it literally takes less energy for you
to imagine yourself actually doing it.

192
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:19,540
And weirdly,

193
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:22,360
they found at Stanford University using,

194
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:22,650
uh,

195
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:23,590
like avatars.

196
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:27,520
If you can see an Avatar that
is designed to look like you,

197
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:29,650
like doing the sort of
things you want to do,

198
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:30,251
like you know,

199
00:05:30,251 --> 00:05:31,240
being really physically fit,

200
00:05:31,241 --> 00:05:32,670
like working out in the game world.

201
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:36,550
If you just watch an avatar custom
design to look like you doing that,

202
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,760
it lowers the cognitive
threshold for you to do it.

203
00:05:39,761 --> 00:05:41,830
And then you will do more in real life.

204
00:05:41,831 --> 00:05:42,161
You'll like,

205
00:05:42,161 --> 00:05:42,820
you know,

206
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:47,820
you will work out more or you'll spend
more time committed to those goals just

207
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:52,600
by having watched this sort of mirror
version of yourself having done it.

208
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:55,440
But he's that guy now
that really is who he is.

209
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,060
He's like all the time,

210
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:57,810
four hours.

211
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:58,070
You call

212
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,910
him up in the middle of the night.

213
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,744
He's dice man.

214
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:00,451
Yeah.

215
00:06:00,451 --> 00:06:01,460
He became that guy.

216
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:02,301
Yeah.

217
00:06:02,301 --> 00:06:03,134
We uh,

218
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,880
I opened up for him for like two,

219
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:05,721
three years.

220
00:06:05,721 --> 00:06:06,481
He really,

221
00:06:06,481 --> 00:06:06,740
yeah,

222
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,900
he picked me out of the comedy story.

223
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:10,530
He came up to me and uh,

224
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,750
at first he goes,

225
00:06:11,751 --> 00:06:12,584
um,

226
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:13,730
you know what you should do.

227
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,470
I said,

228
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:15,303
what?

229
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:17,270
When you go on stage,

230
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,070
put a sack

231
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:26,030
pants and then you'll be like the
comedian who's just got a big cock

232
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:28,610
and this is like,

233
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,950
this is like my guy I looked up to

234
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:33,470
and he's telling me.

235
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,510
And then I actually went home that night,

236
00:06:35,511 --> 00:06:36,344
gone.

237
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,293
Should I do,

238
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:40,630
should I be cat gay?

239
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,320
So,

240
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:43,483
uh,

241
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:45,411
anyway,

242
00:06:45,411 --> 00:06:47,180
we was just kind of beard,

243
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:48,140
little friendship.

244
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:52,520
And he asked me if I wanted to go to
Las Vegas with him at the Stardust hotel

245
00:06:52,521 --> 00:06:53,354
and I'm like,

246
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:54,680
call my parents.

247
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:54,930
I go,

248
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:57,290
I'm opening up for dice
clay at the stone us.

249
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:58,041
My mom was like,

250
00:06:58,041 --> 00:06:58,874
you made it,

251
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,660
you made it.

252
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,260
Wow.

253
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:03,980
So they all came out to see and
I hung out with them on the road.

254
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,810
And uh,

255
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:07,040
the first time we played Vegas,

256
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:07,610
I'm like,

257
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:08,930
I can't believe I'm here.

258
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,370
Wayne Newton theater.

259
00:07:10,371 --> 00:07:11,600
I wonder what we're going to do,

260
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:11,900
you know,

261
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,310
excited and we'll go,

262
00:07:13,311 --> 00:07:16,400
probably go out dinner and
we'll go out to a club,

263
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,320
hang by the pool,

264
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,480
probably got a Cabana.

265
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,490
And he goes,

266
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:22,323
we'll go and grow.

267
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,710
We're going to furniture shopping today.

268
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:25,220
I go,

269
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,053
Huh.

270
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,410
And Las Vegas.

271
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:31,790
So we went furniture shopping because
he had a house out there and he was

272
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:33,080
furnishing his house.

273
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:36,140
So we would go to furniture
stores and he would told me,

274
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,670
sit on the couch.

275
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,653
That's it.

276
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:39,913
When you think,

277
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,350
say grand guy,

278
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,640
it's better than anything.

279
00:07:43,641 --> 00:07:44,930
I got it at my house.

280
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:45,920
It's fantastic.

281
00:07:45,921 --> 00:07:47,510
And we would go to eat.

282
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:49,280
I mean this was a process.

283
00:07:49,281 --> 00:07:51,020
We were laying on carpets.

284
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:55,370
I just see if the carpet
was comfortable and uh,

285
00:07:55,371 --> 00:07:55,990
I'm like,

286
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:56,750
uh,

287
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,231
okay.

288
00:07:57,231 --> 00:07:58,190
I guess this is what you,

289
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:58,971
you do.

290
00:07:58,971 --> 00:08:02,630
This is my first time on the
road and were furniture shop,

291
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,960
but let's go on.

292
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:05,260
Then I made it a casino.

293
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,350
Maybe we go for dinner and he's like,

294
00:08:06,351 --> 00:08:07,184
are you kidding me?

295
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:08,660
It's like the Beatles.

296
00:08:08,661 --> 00:08:09,231
If I go out,

297
00:08:09,231 --> 00:08:09,960
that's like the,

298
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,030
it's like mania.

299
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,410
People going to lose their mind.

300
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:12,981
I can look,

301
00:08:12,981 --> 00:08:13,820
let's try it.

302
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:14,661
And sure enough,

303
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:17,390
we went through the
casino yet is the glasses.

304
00:08:17,391 --> 00:08:22,391
He had like some big glitter ball on his
back of his jacket that we went through

305
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:23,903
it

306
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:26,510
and it was like,

307
00:08:26,511 --> 00:08:27,860
it was fantastic.

308
00:08:27,861 --> 00:08:28,251
It was like,

309
00:08:28,251 --> 00:08:28,760
Oh wow,

310
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,960
this is what he's talking about.

311
00:08:29,961 --> 00:08:30,930
So to swarm them,

312
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:31,190
right.

313
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,023
Just warm them.

314
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:35,090
He's got like a loyal fan base.

315
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:35,990
Oh yeah.

316
00:08:35,991 --> 00:08:36,860
It's crazy.

317
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:37,790
Okay.
