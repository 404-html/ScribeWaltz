1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:00,863
I need fear tactics.
This video will not get demonetized 

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,280
watch.
We're getting demonetized.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,440
What's happening?
Are we going,

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,840
Oh God,
this is so stressful.

5
00:00:09,841 --> 00:00:13,590
What do you need?
The scare tactics because it takes me so

6
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,510
much.
So many threats,

7
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,530
uh,
in so much pain to change my habits.

8
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,250
But you're so self examined.
A Tory.

9
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,310
That's not the right word.
It's called neurotic.

10
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:26,880
But,
but that's not very nice synonym for it.

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,580
Thanks.
Were not getting anything done.

12
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,690
I would agree with you.
Oh,

13
00:00:30,691 --> 00:00:32,670
interesting.
It's not paralyzing.

14
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:34,060
I do.
I,

15
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:37,710
I come from such a dysfunctional nine in
the word.

16
00:00:37,711 --> 00:00:38,544
I feel like that's lost its value.
I come from a very sick family and I'm 

17
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:45,741
very determined to not be sick,
so I'm trying hard to.

18
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:48,050
You get a lot of shit done.
See,

19
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,490
I don't,
I don't agree with this.

20
00:00:49,491 --> 00:00:51,240
Like the,
the idea of paralyzing.

21
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,253
It may hinder in some way,
shape or form or caused obstacles when 

22
00:00:56,101 --> 00:00:58,590
you maneuver around those obstacles.
So I don't,

23
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:00,120
I don't agree with you.
It's tricky.

24
00:01:00,121 --> 00:01:00,900
I mean,
how do you.

25
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,570
I definitely would say it would identify
as self analytical,

26
00:01:03,571 --> 00:01:04,404
but like do you think that's part of 
being a good comedian is being able to 

27
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:08,334
analyze yourself and your neuroses and 
you know for sure if you can't see 

28
00:01:11,341 --> 00:01:12,174
yourself,
it's going to be super hard to really 

29
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:14,723
get other people to relate to you 
because if there's some obvious blind 

30
00:01:17,691 --> 00:01:19,920
spots that they see that you're not 
addressing,

31
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:24,390
it's my nightmare to not be self aware 
and have everybody knows something about

32
00:01:24,391 --> 00:01:27,270
me that I don't know.
I am in constant paranoia.

33
00:01:27,271 --> 00:01:28,104
I mean,
and we know people that don't know 

34
00:01:28,951 --> 00:01:31,370
themselves and who they can't see 
themselves and it seems real.

35
00:01:31,371 --> 00:01:32,370
It terrifies me.

36
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,110
That's what bothers us about those 
people.

37
00:01:34,111 --> 00:01:34,944
It's not necessarily those people with 
that knowing what it is is we're 

38
00:01:37,351 --> 00:01:38,184
terrified of seeing that in ourselves 
100 percent because the antithesis of a 

39
00:01:41,191 --> 00:01:42,024
comedian as somebody who can't see the 
truth and can't look in the mirror and 

40
00:01:44,641 --> 00:01:45,620
like that's my nightmare.
Well,

41
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,550
I think we all know and I think anybody 
knows,

42
00:01:47,551 --> 00:01:48,384
is trying to do anything.
Whatever you try and do when you're 

43
00:01:49,471 --> 00:01:52,020
trying to start a business or write a 
book or what you just did.

44
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,520
Oh,
okay.

45
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,620
Bye.
Whatever you're doing,

46
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,060
whatever you're doing,
it's going to be.

47
00:01:57,061 --> 00:01:58,140
It's going to test you.
Right.

48
00:01:58,141 --> 00:01:59,640
And it's going to be difficult.
There's no,

49
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:04,020
no one is going to like get through it.
You know it all in one incredibly smooth

50
00:02:04,021 --> 00:02:04,854
linear process.
It's going to be like weird shit that 

51
00:02:06,481 --> 00:02:08,370
happens on the way.
And when,

52
00:02:08,371 --> 00:02:09,204
when you see someone who's not doing it 
correctly in your eyes or not doing it 

53
00:02:13,231 --> 00:02:16,770
to the best of their abilities or 
fucking off or being delusional,

54
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,080
it scares the shit out of him because 
you're like,

55
00:02:19,081 --> 00:02:19,680
God damn it.

56
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,513
That could be me.
I could lose a year of everything I've 

57
00:02:22,741 --> 00:02:23,574
been concentrating on to like deny.
I lived in denial I think for a long 

58
00:02:26,851 --> 00:02:28,220
time.
And um,

59
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,333
I was sort of like sleepwalking through 
life and kind of like unconscious I 

60
00:02:31,681 --> 00:02:32,514
think for like a lot of my teens and 
early twenties due to like some fucked 

61
00:02:36,601 --> 00:02:39,210
up shit that I saw and lived.
And it was all survival mechanisms,

62
00:02:39,211 --> 00:02:40,044
but I just always want to make sure that
I've disarmed those and [inaudible] and 

63
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:47,460
I'm not like just being a puppet of my 
fear.

64
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,670
Right.
But I think like to give you more credit

65
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:51,504
than you give yourself,
I think that that self examine the 

66
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,980
Tories,
self-reflecting aspect of it,

67
00:02:55,981 --> 00:02:56,814
which seems to you to like this be as 
constant self criticism is just almost 

68
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:02,314
like a watcher.
I go watch her over your thoughts to 

69
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:07,000
make sure have you keep this fucking 
thing together.

70
00:03:07,001 --> 00:03:08,500
You crazy bitch.
Come on.

71
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:09,573
Here we go.
But along the way I look all the things 

72
00:03:10,901 --> 00:03:13,210
you've accomplished.
So I don't think you've been.

73
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,490
I mean you haven't been impeded by it as
much as you've been aware of it.

74
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,100
Yeah,
that's the idea.

75
00:03:20,101 --> 00:03:22,650
And I definitely think I need to start 
there.

76
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:27,590
We live in this world of constant 
feedback and I guess my thing is like,

77
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,690
I give myself enough feedback.
I don't also need your feedback with the

78
00:03:30,691 --> 00:03:34,320
likes and the at replies and the trolls 
and the reddits and the whatever.

79
00:03:34,321 --> 00:03:36,330
So I think that that magnified it a 
little bit.

80
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:37,343
And I had to do like a little bit of a 
social media internet cleansing where I 

81
00:03:40,081 --> 00:03:45,081
didn't sort of constantly let go down 
the wormhole of like people trashing

82
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:47,040
negative,
just good,

83
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:47,883
just as a matter of resources.
And if you 24 hours seems like a lot of 

84
00:03:51,101 --> 00:03:54,460
time until you start dissecting it into 
the things you actually enjoy doing.

85
00:03:54,461 --> 00:03:55,294
And how much time do you actually really
have with eating and sleeping and 

86
00:03:58,031 --> 00:04:00,240
traveling and commuting,
crying,

87
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,990
furious.
Punching the wall furiously.

88
00:04:04,991 --> 00:04:07,120
Masturbating and crying.
And the tub.

89
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,720
What do you,
uh,

90
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,410
you know,
how much time do you really have law?

91
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,740
You've got to be careful with your time.

92
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:12,531
Yeah.
No,

93
00:04:12,531 --> 00:04:13,364
I agree.
I'm pretty hardcore about protecting my 

94
00:04:14,961 --> 00:04:16,720
time.
I used to not be before,

95
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,710
before I got a handle on like my 
codependence,

96
00:04:18,711 --> 00:04:20,210
anyone who wanted to go on a fucking 
hike.

97
00:04:20,211 --> 00:04:23,480
I was at runyon every morning.
Everybody was getting coffee and I just,

98
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:24,530
I don't do that shit anymore.

99
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:28,860
That's like one of the biggest problems 
with conspiracy theories.

100
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,233
One of the biggest problems with people 
that get involved in conspiracy 

101
00:04:32,101 --> 00:04:33,180
theories.
They go,

102
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:36,270
you remember what the fuck is his name 
that come in?

103
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,450
Who was,
um,

104
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,570
Kevin Costner.
Kevin goes to JFK movie.

105
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,160
Yeah.
Oliver Stone.

106
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:47,390
I wrote my seniors honors thesis on the 
postmodern implications of JFK.

107
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,290
Did you really?
What do you think about jails cleared?

108
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:54,140
I don't have a ton of thoughts on like 
I'm not an authority on it.

109
00:04:54,141 --> 00:04:54,974
The movie is unbelievable.
I believe at the time it had the most 

110
00:04:56,451 --> 00:04:59,900
cuts of any movie and I was obsessed 
with postmodernism at the time,

111
00:04:59,901 --> 00:05:00,734
like Jean Baudrillard,
so I was like obsessed with him using 

112
00:05:02,781 --> 00:05:03,614
like archive footage and reenact of 
footage and new footage and outfit and 

113
00:05:06,201 --> 00:05:08,420
just the way that he told the story was 
brilliant.

114
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,033
I Dunno,
I think you mean jfk assassination was 

115
00:05:12,141 --> 00:05:14,000
actually thinking subject.
I'm,

116
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:15,343
I just in the last couple days got 
annoyed at JFK as the president and he 

117
00:05:20,241 --> 00:05:23,660
was the most telegenic president and the
first televised president basically.

118
00:05:23,661 --> 00:05:24,494
Right.
He kind of.

119
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,103
Well,
I definitely had been on tv that good 

120
00:05:27,821 --> 00:05:28,654
bunch of guys had been on tv,
but TV was a different thing in 1963 

121
00:05:31,511 --> 00:05:32,500
then it wasn't 53.

122
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:37,700
He was the first like star handsome.
He was the first president who was after

123
00:05:40,561 --> 00:05:41,394
him.
Presidents had to start being handsome 

124
00:05:42,451 --> 00:05:43,284
and charismatic,
and I was just in some arguments this 

125
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:46,741
week where people were like,
well,

126
00:05:46,741 --> 00:05:48,480
Hillary just wasn't charismatic and I'm 
like,

127
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:49,343
who fucking cares?
Like since when is that the number one 

128
00:05:52,321 --> 00:05:53,154
box that a president has to check?
Not qualified or like we can't match 

129
00:05:56,901 --> 00:05:58,070
the.
Yes we do.

130
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,220
We want cult leaders.
Well,

131
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,063
yeah,
we want someone that comes out of 

132
00:06:01,851 --> 00:06:04,700
nowhere that also doesn't want to fuck 
all the time.

133
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:05,983
Correct.
We want someone that can figure it all 

134
00:06:11,091 --> 00:06:15,410
out and it has all of these key 
attributes of a leader,

135
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,380
but we don't want that leader conquer 
mindset.

136
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,320
Correct.
We want to have our cake and eat it too.

137
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:23,030
But,
but JFK was the first,

138
00:06:23,031 --> 00:06:26,900
like handsome precedent for presidents 
had to look healthy.

139
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,250
I don't want my president look healthy.
I want to be tired and anemic.

140
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,610
I don't want them to have been at 
Martha's vineyard getting a Tan.

141
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:39,820
Can you imagine a time where we have a 
president that everyone likes no means I

142
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,620
kind of amazing.
Yeah.

143
00:06:42,621 --> 00:06:44,000
But that's just our tribalism,
right?

144
00:06:44,001 --> 00:06:47,690
We're not really designed to live in 
tribes over like 60 people.

145
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,580
Right.
This is all just madness.

146
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:50,743
Total madness.

147
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,270
We're not designed for it.
We're bad.

148
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,253
It's like.
But is it possible that someone can 

149
00:06:55,011 --> 00:06:55,844
achieve some sort of.
I mean even if you achieve some Martin 

150
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:01,160
Luther King Jr state,
you know,

151
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,330
where you were,
that level of speaker in,

152
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:05,533
although you were a black guy,
you were so obviously super intelligent 

153
00:07:09,101 --> 00:07:13,420
and so spiritual that even racist had to
go make it.

154
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:17,190
A lot of good kids.
He's got a sexy guy.

155
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:21,230
His fucking way of speaking was so it 
was like a song.

156
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:23,210
It was a,
it was like he had this,

157
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,990
it was almost like a,
sorry to denigrate Marlin by saying,

158
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:30,170
but he had the cadence of like a 
comedian who was like in the rhythm,

159
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,330
like he was hypnotic in the way that he 
spoke.

160
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,223
Oh yeah.
Do not judge a man by the color of his 

161
00:07:35,571 --> 00:07:38,390
skin,
but by the content of his character.

162
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:39,224
Like why?

163
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,100
Like how,
like where did that come from?

164
00:07:43,101 --> 00:07:43,934
Preachers,
right?

165
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:45,530
Is that like Jensen?
You know,

166
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:48,170
it's like musical.
That was why kinison was so good.

167
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:50,600
Kinison was amazing.
Preacher.

168
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,290
He was one of those hell fire tent 
preachers.

169
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,970
These,
there's video or at least audio,

170
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:56,863
maybe video as well of him doing a tent 
revival and it's fucking incredible to 

171
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,713
see that.
It's just all about the rhythm and the 

172
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,770
Jesus,
but it's also just the electricity,

173
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:07,880
which is like,
you know,

174
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:08,813
people are always like,
how do I do comedy and how do we just 

175
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,730
stand up?
Do I write jokes?

176
00:08:10,731 --> 00:08:11,660
It's like,
yeah,

177
00:08:11,661 --> 00:08:12,830
you can write jokes,
you can do this,

178
00:08:12,831 --> 00:08:14,060
you can do 10,000
hours,

179
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:14,960
you can get whatever.
But like,

180
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:18,050
do you,
can you deliver electricity on demand?

181
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,123
I don't know how to teach you that.
You can't teach someone that know and 

182
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:22,903
hit.
That's the thing about a guy like 

183
00:08:23,511 --> 00:08:26,840
Kennison too.
It's like what he was doing,

184
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:28,700
like,
you know,

185
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:29,823
he was talking about the power of the 
Lord and the power of God and the power 

186
00:08:32,181 --> 00:08:37,181
of Jesus and say his name.
He stopped around on stage and you know,

187
00:08:37,271 --> 00:08:39,050
and then that God,
God is alive.

188
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:40,483
And the thing is,
he was doing it so good that he was 

189
00:08:43,851 --> 00:08:44,684
right.
He was doing it so good that the people 

190
00:08:46,731 --> 00:08:49,280
who are watching got a feeling from it.
Like,

191
00:08:49,281 --> 00:08:54,281
oh my God,
and maybe you and I are too skeptical.

192
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:56,163
Maybe.

193
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,440
Maybe we're fools because we can't just 
give into it.

194
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,890
Maybe we're fools that we can't just sit
there and watch some guy go off.

195
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,990
Maybe we were fools that we don't just 
speak in tongues.

196
00:09:03,991 --> 00:09:05,070
Just let it all go.

197
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,480
I know it's.
I mean,

198
00:09:06,481 --> 00:09:08,760
I'm too much of a fucking contract.
I'm just a science freak.

199
00:09:08,761 --> 00:09:11,910
I'm like,
but what about I love the Lord.

200
00:09:11,911 --> 00:09:13,950
But like are there some metrics to go 
with that?

201
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:16,820
Something's happening.
Why are they getting so happy?

202
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:19,520
Obviously they're getting,
he's exciting.

203
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:20,803
He's inspiring them.
He's giving them some sort of almost 

204
00:09:23,241 --> 00:09:24,710
like mental placebo effect.

205
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,000
Yeah.
I really do feel like there.

206
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,913
I mean,
you really do get dopamine from someone 

207
00:09:28,751 --> 00:09:31,060
being a leader and taking charge.

208
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,063
So like just entertain the thought that 
that's what God is a god is those 

209
00:09:36,371 --> 00:09:37,640
moments,
you know,

210
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:38,523
when they.
They're more and more extreme as we get 

211
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,133
more and more evolved,
but those moments where people sort of 

212
00:09:43,631 --> 00:09:46,810
figured out and get together and lock on
whatever that energy is,

213
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,600
but sometimes they on and they decided 
to kill Jews.

214
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,270
Yeah,
but they don't get together and look,

215
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:56,810
I have a good idea and it's a bad idea 
and they all start locking on.

216
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,673
They don't do it on a post.
You can use it for evil or you can use 

217
00:09:59,931 --> 00:10:01,160
it for good.
I feel like.

218
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:05,820
Well definitely the whole biological 
instinct of humans can go south.

219
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:08,310
They can get Western with people real 
quick,

220
00:10:08,311 --> 00:10:09,144
which is why people should be really 
terrified of anybody who assumes any 

221
00:10:11,101 --> 00:10:13,300
sort of position of power.
Even the state itself.

222
00:10:13,301 --> 00:10:14,134
Right?
That's what freaks me out of all these 

223
00:10:14,671 --> 00:10:17,120
people that want Marxism and socialism.
It's like you are.

224
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,293
You want to.
How much money do you want to give the 

225
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:20,124
taxes?
Like you want people to pay 90 percent 

226
00:10:21,901 --> 00:10:23,160
taxes.
Do you understand that?

227
00:10:23,161 --> 00:10:24,930
That means someone is getting that 
money.

228
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:26,910
Do you understand that entity getting 
that money?

229
00:10:26,911 --> 00:10:28,350
The government is going to want more of 
it.

230
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:29,820
They grow,
they just keep growing.

231
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:32,470
The only trick about that is like you're
so smart and you're like,

232
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:36,830
you the word understand it has no place 
in people trying to feel safe.

233
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,200
Like we're just these visceral animals 
who are just like,

234
00:10:39,201 --> 00:10:39,921
am I safe?
Am I safe?

235
00:10:39,921 --> 00:10:40,754
Am I safe?
It was maybe like our brains are only 

236
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:42,283
designed to keep us alive.
They're not designed to make us think 

237
00:10:43,671 --> 00:10:45,830
logically and you're not safe,
you know,

238
00:10:45,831 --> 00:10:47,800
one safe,
you're safe right now.

239
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:52,870
We are a trash bag full of blood,
live texting and driving.

240
00:10:54,471 --> 00:10:58,010
We are about to die every 20 minutes.
Make some good trash bags,

241
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,780
hefty law in there and shit.
We are,

242
00:11:02,781 --> 00:11:04,040
uh,
I mean I can't,

243
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:06,010
but everyday I'm like,
how did I make it through?

244
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:06,883
How did I survive this day?
Why aren't I doing everything should 

245
00:11:09,411 --> 00:11:09,951
kill us.
I mean,

246
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,690
I think it was in that book Sapiens,
just the idea that like,

247
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,610
you know,
so much of our anxiety comes in the fact

248
00:11:13,611 --> 00:11:14,444
that we all know that we're only 
subconsciously at the top of the food 

249
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:16,874
chain.
Like we should not be at the top of the 

250
00:11:17,871 --> 00:11:19,700
food chain.
It's only because we developed weapons,

251
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:22,190
like we know that at any point like we 
deserve.

252
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:24,650
We deserve our life expectancy to be 
like 16,

253
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:25,573
but I think developing the weapons is 
also what led to us getting like this 

254
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,500
here,
but we're so vulnerable,

255
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:31,343
but I'll think all this vulnerable stuff
came along with the advent of 

256
00:11:34,021 --> 00:11:35,100
inventions.
Yeah.

257
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:35,983
I think that when we.
Obviously I'm an idiot but don't listen 

258
00:11:37,951 --> 00:11:38,784
to me,
but I would think that when we didn't 

259
00:11:41,011 --> 00:11:41,844
have anything other than the other and 
what will the animals had our instincts 

260
00:11:44,881 --> 00:11:45,714
clause and okay,

261
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,593
well we can't sleep outside overnight.
How long you're actually that whole 

262
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,040
month person I know who could probably 
live outside a site.

263
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:57,540
Anybody can do it,
but it's not good for Elon.

264
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,020
I mean we are not anymore,
right?

265
00:11:59,021 --> 00:11:59,854
We're so infantilized at this point.
I think we're getting closer and closer 

266
00:12:02,231 --> 00:12:04,510
to those fucking gray aliens that you 
see in the movies.

267
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:07,150
That's what we're going to be a giant 
head,

268
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,103
little skinny arms and that's what those
things are where they have vintage 

269
00:12:14,141 --> 00:12:19,141
glasses on instead of black eyes.
It was a fucking great commercial.

270
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:20,583
I don't know what it's for,
but it's a hipster and Danny trio and 

271
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:24,603
and Danny Trejo is a bartender and some 
hipster is asking for like this custom 

272
00:12:28,871 --> 00:12:29,704
craft beer that's like leather but not 
shoes like a belt and he's like going 

273
00:12:33,611 --> 00:12:36,650
through all this like hit woody earthy 
like he's going through all different.

274
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,713
It's really funny.
Did a trio staring at him with his no 

275
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:43,100
nonsense face dude.
The tattooed up Mexican towns.

276
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,550
I'm aware of that.
I know Danny Trejo.

277
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:49,240
It's fucking hilarious commercial.
I can finally talk about this,

278
00:12:49,241 --> 00:12:50,074
but it took me getting my ear bitten off
by a dog to realize how fucking 

279
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:56,770
vulnerable we are.
Oh yeah.

280
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,180
It happened.
I didn't eat.

281
00:12:58,181 --> 00:13:00,430
I didn't see it come.
It just keep.

282
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:04,660
My ear was gone and it seems as a rescue
dog that you have a dog that I.

283
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,270
That was at the Carson shelter and was 
about to be euthanized.

284
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,133
I just got.
I try to grab any dogs that's going to 

285
00:13:09,241 --> 00:13:10,270
be euthanized.
He came in.

286
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,590
He had been taken from his mother too 
young.

287
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:12,424
He wasn't neutered,
didn't have spacial intelligence yet it 

288
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,630
wasn't his fault.
He didn't attack me.

289
00:13:16,631 --> 00:13:17,464
He was.
Their mouth is their hands and when 

290
00:13:18,821 --> 00:13:20,020
they're taken from their mother too 
young,

291
00:13:20,021 --> 00:13:21,910
they don't learn manners basically.

292
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:26,260
So I also made the mistake of not 
establishing myself as the alpha.

293
00:13:26,261 --> 00:13:27,094
I was just felt so sorry for him and I 
pitied him instead of doing the right 

294
00:13:30,221 --> 00:13:31,300
thing,
like all my dogs,

295
00:13:31,301 --> 00:13:33,520
I established myself as the alpha.
They're not allowed to lick me.

296
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,950
They're not allowed to jump on me and I 
let him do that.

297
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:36,813
Then I pushed him off me and it's just,
you don't allow your dog to look your 

298
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:43,300
jump on you sometimes,
but I have to end it before they end it,

299
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,640
but I genuinely.
I generally don't.

300
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:46,960
Wow.
That's deep.

301
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:49,120
It's not.
It's not ideal.

302
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:50,463
It's deep because every now and then you
do need them to really respect you when 

303
00:13:53,951 --> 00:13:54,784
a car is coming,
when they get out and it is a dominant 

304
00:13:56,771 --> 00:14:00,100
thing to lick you and to jump on you.
That's weird.

305
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,293
Why?
Because I never thought of that like 

306
00:14:02,981 --> 00:14:03,814
that.

307
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:08,620
But I do have these moments with my 
puppy of a puppy.

308
00:14:08,621 --> 00:14:11,050
I guess he's 10 months old now,
maybe 11 neuter,

309
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,340
not yet know.
And he's just a super sweetheart.

310
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,620
Super Sweet.
Golden,

311
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:17,463
right?
Yeah.

312
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,350
Just like humans and sometimes he 
doesn't want to kiss me,

313
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,693
like sometimes shies away from kissing 
me and then once he kisses me realize 

314
00:14:24,851 --> 00:14:27,880
that it's okay.
Then he kisses me a bunch and uh,

315
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:28,893
he's always,
he did climb on top of me except in a 

316
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:34,360
submissive position and climbs on top of
me and lifts his arms up in the air so I

317
00:14:34,361 --> 00:14:36,100
can rub his belly.
This is very good news.

318
00:14:36,101 --> 00:14:36,934
So,
um,

319
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:39,790
when you make eye contact with him,
does he look away a little bit?

320
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:40,810
That's good.
That's what you want.

321
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:41,703
You want it.
So whenever I have to ascertain whether 

322
00:14:42,761 --> 00:14:43,594
a dog is dominant or not,
I look them in the eyes and if they 

323
00:14:44,831 --> 00:14:45,664
don't look away,
I have a dominant dog and that's a 

324
00:14:46,601 --> 00:14:48,580
problem.
So you have to do all these things.

325
00:14:48,581 --> 00:14:50,170
You've got to like put them on their 
back.

326
00:14:50,171 --> 00:14:52,550
You gotta like hold them down until they
exhale.

327
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,280
That's a problem.
You don't,

328
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,210
you dogs.
Um,

329
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,090
when they don't have an Alpha,
they're designed to have a leader.

330
00:14:59,091 --> 00:15:01,010
They love discipline and when they 
don't,

331
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:01,873
it's just,
it's chaos and most people are not in 

332
00:15:03,651 --> 00:15:05,080
control of their animals.
Yeah,

333
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,013
that's interesting.
We do a lot of things like we make them 

334
00:15:07,671 --> 00:15:08,504
sit before he comes in the house and 
it's going to stay with the door wide 

335
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:11,720
open.
They love that.

336
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:13,680
Put his food out.
He has to stay,

337
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:16,280
walk through a dog.
You never walk around a dog.

338
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,710
Like if your dogs in front of you,
you walk right through them,

339
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:21,230
just bumped him.
You just get them out of the way because

340
00:15:21,231 --> 00:15:22,064
that's,
you're in my house instead of I'm going 

341
00:15:23,061 --> 00:15:26,720
to walk around you.
That's interesting to other dogs.

342
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:29,170
A massive.
And uh,

343
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,990
I have a,
he's a sweetie too.

344
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:33,723
My kids ride them like you can ride him 
like he's just like such a big teddy 

345
00:15:38,211 --> 00:15:38,510
bear.

346
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:39,343
I have a great day.
And pitbull who's like kind of looks 

347
00:15:40,611 --> 00:15:45,611
like Johnny cash is his name and he's 
what's called a regency massive.

348
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:48,230
And the regency massive is half 
Neapolitan.

349
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,690
Massive and half pit bull with a bread 
for.

350
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:51,870
Oh,
if it has pitfalls.

351
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:52,893
And the guy who bread it was one of,
he had had dogs if you brought on fear 

352
00:15:57,291 --> 00:16:00,440
factor too,
and they used them as attack dogs and it

353
00:16:00,441 --> 00:16:01,274
was fucking hilarious because we used to
have people that they would get these 

354
00:16:03,861 --> 00:16:08,861
Belgian malinois on.
People does dogs or police dogs.

355
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,660
Those dogs look at you.
So different than any,

356
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:12,523
the dogs they have like a look of like 
just give me the green light dance and 

357
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:16,470
they grab and they shake.
Oh,

358
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:19,670
I know someone who they grabbed face 
shook his face.

359
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,080
Oh God.
Yeah.

360
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,730
Smaller.
There were a smaller dog,

361
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,430
like a 60,
70 pound dog.

362
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:26,263
Like I'll just have taught ball of wire.
But these regency mastiffs are 140 in 

363
00:16:31,431 --> 00:16:33,410
their tanks.
Did Gypsy that stupid movie,

364
00:16:33,411 --> 00:16:36,320
the Hulk with Eric with uh,
what's his name?

365
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:38,850
Band bands.
Didn't have.

366
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:39,950
Ignore it.
And do one also.

367
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:41,420
Yes,
his was better.

368
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,550
But the ban of one Nick Nolte D was.
I can't believe we're talking about this

369
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:46,993
too,
but I forgot to bring up this one 

370
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,793
crucial part.
Nick Nolte DC was Eric Ban his dad and 

371
00:16:55,311 --> 00:16:59,030
he injected these dogs with this hope 
serum.

372
00:16:59,031 --> 00:17:01,970
So these pitbulls became hulk pit bulls 
do attack the hawk.

373
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:03,163
It was so stupid.
But the dog thing to model the hulk pit 

374
00:17:07,031 --> 00:17:12,031
bull was curly.
Curly was my dogs dad tank of a dog.

375
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,940
That's the sweetest dog you've ever 
seen.

376
00:17:16,941 --> 00:17:17,774
That's like the image that they drew for
the renderings the actual dog looked 

377
00:17:23,601 --> 00:17:24,434
like in the movie.
It was like a giant hooked out pit bull 

378
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:29,600
rescue that to us.
That's it right there.

379
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:32,950
I would let that dog in my bed.
I love them.

380
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:33,784
I live right.
I think that there is something about 

381
00:17:34,941 --> 00:17:36,100
it.
So interesting that you have a couple of

382
00:17:36,101 --> 00:17:39,140
kinds of breeds because I feel like 
people usually see themselves in a breed

383
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,430
and that's their thing,
you know,

384
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:44,780
and if yours is massive,
but what made you do a meathead?

385
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:46,180
He looked awesome.
Yeah.

386
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:47,163
That's literally.
He was awesome and he was super sweet 

387
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,100
like he's this

388
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:52,320
dog.
Curly was the sweetest dog,

389
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:53,154
you know that the most.
The dogs that were bred to fight dogs 

390
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:56,574
and they were also selected for the ones
that were the kindness to the owners 

391
00:17:59,191 --> 00:18:02,940
because the dog fighters didn't tolerate
dogs that were violent towards people.

392
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:06,040
A bunch of pit bulls.
I know the whole deal behind them.

393
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:10,110
The tragic irony is that they're trained
to be weapons,

394
00:18:10,111 --> 00:18:12,570
but they're trained to be very 
emotionally attached to people's.

395
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,433
They're so attached to you.
Those things give you is so intense and 

396
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,470
so unconditional,
so intense.

397
00:18:19,471 --> 00:18:20,550
It's weird.
They're like,

398
00:18:20,551 --> 00:18:24,510
there's so much more vibrant than a lot 
of other dogs and the way they love you,

399
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,533
it's like so different.
And the ones that are rescued I think 

400
00:18:27,151 --> 00:18:30,000
also know on some level.
Yeah,

401
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,043
I had this one.
She wouldn't even let any other dogs 

402
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,173
near me,
like I had to give her all the love of 

403
00:18:35,611 --> 00:18:36,720
the other dogs came near her.

404
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,770
Everybody got snapped at and backed off.
I had to get all the love to her first.

405
00:18:40,771 --> 00:18:41,580
I had a friend,
I mean,

406
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,490
and they also gravitate towards 
vulnerable,

407
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:47,610
so when I'm sick they get more 
protective of me.

408
00:18:47,611 --> 00:18:49,710
When I had the injury,
like when my ear was ripped off,

409
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:52,500
they were all like when someone come in 
and they'd be like extra flexing on like

410
00:18:52,501 --> 00:18:55,230
the gardeners and stuff like they,
they're really empathic.

411
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,140
It's pretty.
I've learned so much from training dogs,

412
00:18:58,141 --> 00:19:00,900
especially ones with low impulse 
control.

413
00:19:00,901 --> 00:19:01,734
They don't have a lot of impulse control
so you have to teach them impulse 

414
00:19:03,571 --> 00:19:06,720
control because they're designed not 
only to fight but also to chase rats and

415
00:19:06,721 --> 00:19:09,180
there's a root.
So to bring it all back.

416
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:11,640
Johnny cash,
my two dogs,

417
00:19:11,641 --> 00:19:14,730
brutus as much smaller.
Brutus is an English bulldog.

418
00:19:14,731 --> 00:19:15,564
She inu mix and so many flaps and so 
when they're both going to enter into 

419
00:19:23,071 --> 00:19:23,904
the house to eat,
Johnny always knocks brutus or either 

420
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:28,770
way like pitch,
step aside,

421
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,990
bitch,
step aside,

422
00:19:30,991 --> 00:19:34,080
like it's,
they have such a clear run how it works,

423
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:34,590
pecking order.

424
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,410
I told you about when I went to that.
Um,

425
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,100
no,
I don't think I did the wolf sanctuary.

426
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:40,280
She did like how,
you know,

427
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,303
you just,
you have to leave them alone and let 

428
00:19:42,211 --> 00:19:43,620
them have their pecking order.
There's the Alpha,

429
00:19:43,621 --> 00:19:45,590
the Beta and the mega.
You got to just leave them alone.

430
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,230
Like people like don't leave them alone.
Let them work it out.

431
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,513
You can't interject into nature just 
because you're uncomfortable with your 

432
00:19:52,981 --> 00:19:54,390
own mortality.
Exactly.

433
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,033
I mean,
I tell people to leave the dog park all 

434
00:19:57,301 --> 00:19:59,700
the fucking time.
People are so stupid with their dogs and

435
00:19:59,701 --> 00:20:00,534
they project their shit onto their dogs 
and they're codependent with their dogs 

436
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:04,620
and uh,
you know,

437
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:07,450
the way to get pimples or to unlock,
you know,

438
00:20:07,451 --> 00:20:08,820
to get dogs.
Yeah.

439
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,713
So I'm just sticking my finger in 
buttholes at the dog park constantly to 

440
00:20:13,381 --> 00:20:16,320
get dogs to stop fighting because people
don't want to control their dogs.

441
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:18,990
Most people that have those kind of 
dogs,

442
00:20:18,991 --> 00:20:21,360
they don't realize that it's.
This is not like getting a lab.

443
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:25,130
You're getting a dangerous animal.
Loves to fight.

444
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,033
Loves it.
They fight the lock on each other and 

445
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:29,110
wagtails.
Yeah.

446
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,640
And you have to be able to ascertain the
difference between when things get real,

447
00:20:32,641 --> 00:20:35,500
like the hair on their back and went and
playful and you're.

448
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:39,270
And then the dog feels your fear and 
then they started to get protective.

449
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:40,104
That's.
People don't understand like all the 

450
00:20:40,891 --> 00:20:41,724
time when I'm walking my dogs and 
someone's like and they start pulling 

451
00:20:43,861 --> 00:20:46,710
their dog away and I'm like,
what you're doing is you're feeling fear

452
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,573
now your dog's going to get aggressive.
So you're manifesting this dog fights 

453
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,020
with your fucking bullshit fear.
Like get your shit together.

454
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:54,283
So frustrating.

455
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:56,150
Well,
that's where the argument comes in.

456
00:20:57,050 --> 00:20:59,750
Do we really want those kinds of pets?
I mean,

457
00:20:59,751 --> 00:21:02,800
do we really want people to have 
dangerous doners pets?

458
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,820
Yeah,
but it's a super responsibility.

459
00:21:04,821 --> 00:21:06,680
And I agree that many people could do it
correctly,

460
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:10,520
but it is a super responsibility to have
a warrior animal.

461
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:11,420
I agree.
And I mean,

462
00:21:11,421 --> 00:21:12,254
I,
I do think that for a lot of these 

463
00:21:13,211 --> 00:21:18,211
animals that are just so unbelievably 
fast and you know,

464
00:21:18,701 --> 00:21:19,534
designed to do damage that,
I mean the same way we get driver's 

465
00:21:21,611 --> 00:21:22,444
license for cars,
you're operating something that can 

466
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:24,873
injure people like you should.
I don't think people should have big 

467
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:30,470
dogs but big teeth without taking some 
kind of test prep.

468
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:35,620
I have a friend who runs greyhounds,
they have greyhounds and they have these

469
00:21:36,021 --> 00:21:39,710
dogs that they there are so fast and 
he's like,

470
00:21:39,711 --> 00:21:43,490
these things are so ferocious that they 
won't even play with other dogs.

471
00:21:43,491 --> 00:21:48,380
Like if they find him another dog or a 
coyote or a poodle or they'll kill it.

472
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:50,060
Yeah.
They just immediately kill it.

473
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,100
And that's a bummer.
It is a bummer.

474
00:21:52,101 --> 00:21:56,400
And I had a buddy who rescued racing 
greyhounds stimulus before pimples,

475
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,300
actually.
Great.

476
00:21:57,301 --> 00:21:58,760
Hence,
well the ones that were there,

477
00:21:58,761 --> 00:22:01,250
I mean they weren't pets at all.
They were just existing to race.

478
00:22:01,251 --> 00:22:03,800
They were existing is gambling dogs.
Yeah.

479
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,110
And that's a really common thing.
I know,

480
00:22:06,111 --> 00:22:08,560
I hate it.
So he would rescue these dogs.

481
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:09,763
He rescued one of them and he couldn't 
keep it because it anytime it saw a cat 

482
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,060
or a small gods having a cheetah.
Yeah,

483
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,213
we're just having this thing.
So I mean if you raise it from a puppy 

484
00:22:19,591 --> 00:22:20,970
you can usually,
you know.

485
00:22:20,971 --> 00:22:23,640
No really.
I don't know a ton about greyhounds,

486
00:22:23,641 --> 00:22:24,474
but I don't know.
You can raise the lions from cubs and 

487
00:22:26,551 --> 00:22:28,140
they,
they seem on instagram.

488
00:22:28,141 --> 00:22:30,120
They're biting them and hanging out with
them.

489
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,840
But oddly enough,
and this is going to sound weird,

490
00:22:32,841 --> 00:22:36,080
lions seem to be calmer than a lot of 
other animals that we.

491
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,700
It's male lions for sure.
Right.

492
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:38,733
Male lions are only awake two hours a 
day and they don't do anything as long 

493
00:22:40,421 --> 00:22:43,030
as you feed the female on,
you're nice to them all the time.

494
00:22:43,031 --> 00:22:45,760
I think you can connect with these guys 
on Instagram,

495
00:22:45,761 --> 00:22:47,200
black Jaguar,
white tiger,

496
00:22:47,201 --> 00:22:50,950
you know the guy and they're snuggling 
with fucking panther or something.

497
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,890
I heard something that they have their 
scent on them.

498
00:22:53,891 --> 00:22:57,010
They put their urine on them like they 
declaw them.

499
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:59,400
I don't recall,
but even that's not going to help you if

500
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:01,330
the thing decides to bite you.
It's a wrap.

501
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:02,770
There's no way you're going to survive.

502
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:03,351
It's over.
Well,

503
00:23:03,351 --> 00:23:07,850
member Tippi hedren.
She the hitchcock actress.

504
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:08,913
Well,
you pulled it like the Tippi Hedren 

505
00:23:09,861 --> 00:23:11,420
Shambala.
She,

506
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:12,283
Melanie Griffith,
grew up with 18 tigers and lions in the 

507
00:23:15,531 --> 00:23:17,490
home in La,
in La.

508
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:18,403
Right outside.
And they did a documentary about it and 

509
00:23:20,391 --> 00:23:23,120
everyone on the crew got attacked.
They got their scalp ripped off.

510
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:26,330
Melanie Griffith had some injury and 
then tippy came out later and was like,

511
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,640
they are not pads,
do not have them in their house.

512
00:23:28,641 --> 00:23:30,290
It's dangerous.
Is a bad idea.

513
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:35,640
But she had 19 of them in Encino.
Like,

514
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:39,410
what the fuck is going on?
I wish I was alive in the seven days.

515
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:41,660
People just didn't know how to live yet,
but.

516
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:43,150
Or did they?
I don't know.

517
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:46,310
But if you raise them from infancy,

518
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:48,650
if they're domesticated,
it's just a little different.

519
00:23:48,651 --> 00:23:50,580
Right?
I'm sure.

520
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:51,613
I'm sure it's different,
but there's still the potential for 

521
00:23:53,961 --> 00:23:57,050
something going sideways,
but it's also tricky because it's like,

522
00:23:57,051 --> 00:23:59,120
and this is like the work I do with 
horses and dogs,

523
00:23:59,121 --> 00:24:04,121
it's like if you get scared and they 
feel it and if you run food runs right,

524
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,233
it's you fuck yourself.
It's really like you decide if they 

525
00:24:06,831 --> 00:24:10,070
attack you or not based on your energy.
They're like baby,

526
00:24:10,071 --> 00:24:13,880
first generation,
like Viking animals.

527
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:14,773
You know what I mean?
It's like if you could get them and 

528
00:24:16,551 --> 00:24:20,180
raise a bear and then have the bear's 
cubs and the bears,

529
00:24:20,181 --> 00:24:21,014
cubs cubs maybe.
Have you seen any generation's 

530
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:26,060
epigenetic imprinting of.
They've always been domesticated.

531
00:24:26,061 --> 00:24:27,950
Have you seen that guy that swims at the
polar bear?

532
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,433
The fuck is he doing?
It's going to keep that thing in 

533
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:34,130
Benadryl or what's happening?

534
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:34,963
Why is it in a swimming pool?
And the best part of that video is the 

535
00:24:37,311 --> 00:24:38,780
gate is like chicken wire.
I'm like,

536
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:42,200
there's a neighbor who's just like in 
his house who has not left in two years.

537
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,340
Your neighbor has a polar bear wrapped 
up and chicken wire and what is,

538
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,630
what's,
what is that?

539
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:53,080
Well,
this is some gay bear stuff with him.

540
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:56,030
This bear.
I'm a hundred percent sure of it.

541
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,620
Like,
look at that fence.

542
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:59,060
Look at that neighbor.
That neighbor is like,

543
00:24:59,061 --> 00:25:04,061
fuck this shit insane.
Where is that?

544
00:25:04,081 --> 00:25:04,914
It looks like Cincinnati.
Well there was a guy in Ohio that had 

545
00:25:07,521 --> 00:25:12,200
his own zoo and then he shot himself 
before he shot himself.

546
00:25:12,201 --> 00:25:13,034
He let all the animals out.
When was this years I'm making that TV 

547
00:25:17,421 --> 00:25:19,280
show on NBC or so.
Yeah.

548
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:21,290
So yeah,
it's real show.

549
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,293
He committed suicide.
Client is running down the freeway and 

550
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:27,440
crazy shit.
So it didn't just happen.

551
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:31,700
Wasn't there like a tiger lose recently?
There have been other ones,

552
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:34,870
but this one we just committed suicide.
Yeah,

553
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:36,440
he whacked himself.
He just like,

554
00:25:36,441 --> 00:25:38,690
I don't want to do this anymore.
And he led all animals.

555
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:47,690
Fuck,
sick lions is just too weird.

556
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:51,260
I just don't want to do this anymore.
And you just ended it.

557
00:25:51,261 --> 00:25:53,870
But he let all the animals go first.
So funny.

558
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:54,980
Yeah.
So the cops.

559
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:55,791
Who is this?
Oh,

560
00:25:55,791 --> 00:26:00,300
this is the guy at the front,
like where is this one?

561
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:05,460
One Call Jaguar deputies with this bad 
luck.

562
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:14,563
It's amazing.
It's amazing that they had to shoot all 

563
00:26:16,821 --> 00:26:19,010
the animals.
Well,

564
00:26:19,011 --> 00:26:19,844
they couldn't let them go and once they,
they were in a certain area that had 

565
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,780
isolated before they spread out.
It's really couldn't find them.

566
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:28,640
I know they killed them all.
Nightmare.

567
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:30,990
It's a nightmare.
When I see a human die,

568
00:26:30,991 --> 00:26:32,180
I'm just like,
oh bummer.

569
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,110
When I see animals,
I'm like,

570
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,620
that's freaking nightmare.
Um,

571
00:26:36,621 --> 00:26:38,660
okay.
So you're new when your,

572
00:26:38,661 --> 00:26:41,420
when your new dog gets neutered.
It's gonna be a game changer.

573
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,010
Yeah.
I'm sure it's energy.

574
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,040
Yeah,

575
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,600
right now.
But he's sweet.

576
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,100
He's,
he's a different kind of.

577
00:26:47,101 --> 00:26:50,670
Dogs are just like lifeguards.
I mean there's weed is dogs.

578
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,533
They're just so nice stories about they 
smell a fire and they get the kid and 

579
00:26:53,911 --> 00:26:57,480
they opened the door and they take it to
a shelter and they put it on a plane and

580
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:01,170
travel arrangements.
Really,

581
00:27:01,171 --> 00:27:03,990
they help you get into college.
They're on a kayak.

582
00:27:03,991 --> 00:27:05,900
I mean they're just such incredible dog.
He's,

583
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,900
he gets a little silly sometimes because
he's young,

584
00:27:07,901 --> 00:27:08,734
like sometimes will test you with things
and won't listen when you tell them to 

585
00:27:10,501 --> 00:27:12,030
do things.
Animals tests you.

586
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:13,760
I want to go like,
are you the leader?

587
00:27:13,761 --> 00:27:14,960
Are you the leader?
Are you the leader?

588
00:27:14,961 --> 00:27:17,090
That's what they're doing.
I think that's kind of what audiences do

589
00:27:17,091 --> 00:27:17,781
as well.
You know,

590
00:27:17,781 --> 00:27:18,614
we were talking earlier about self 
analysis and I am trying to stop with 

591
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:22,873
that shit but it's just hard to turn 
that off because it's like we get on 

592
00:27:24,691 --> 00:27:26,390
stage and were like,
do you like me now?

593
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:27,343
Do you like me now?
What about now we do that for an hour 

594
00:27:28,881 --> 00:27:29,780
every night,
you know,

595
00:27:29,781 --> 00:27:32,090
and then I get off stage and I'm doing 
it to myself.

596
00:27:32,091 --> 00:27:33,440
Do I liked me now?
Do I like me now?

597
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,810
Like it's just a hard thing to fucking 
shut off,

598
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:40,250
you know,
like how do you negotiate on stage?

599
00:27:40,251 --> 00:27:41,084
Like getting feedback and using that 
validation and then as soon as it's 

600
00:27:43,611 --> 00:27:44,960
over,
not needing it at all,

601
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,370
will you have like people that love you 
and a family and shit,

602
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:51,000
you're answering for yourself and people
care about you?

603
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,133
I think the.
I think doing things that are more 

604
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:57,660
difficult than that is a good way to 
even that out.

605
00:27:57,850 --> 00:28:01,860
That is an unbelievably salient point.
Yeah.

606
00:28:01,861 --> 00:28:02,694
I think if you're all,
if that's the most difficult thing in 

607
00:28:04,291 --> 00:28:05,880
your day,
it becomes a.

608
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:09,210
it's got extra weight that it doesn't 
need to have on it.

609
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,870
That's fascinating.
Yeah.

610
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:11,723
That's fascinating.
Is there something more difficult than 

611
00:28:13,021 --> 00:28:15,810
standard of care?
Is Everything is more difficult.

612
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,060
Standup is easy when it's going.
Great.

613
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:19,173
Joey.
Joey Diaz said that stand up is the 

614
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:21,810
easiest,
hardest thing you'll ever do.

615
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:23,640
Perfect.
Perfect.

616
00:28:23,641 --> 00:28:24,600
Way To describe it.
Of course.

617
00:28:24,601 --> 00:28:25,590
Joey said it.
Perfect.

618
00:28:25,591 --> 00:28:26,090
Yeah.

619
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:26,990
Do you.
Of course,

620
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,033
you know this,
but I read something recently about how 

621
00:28:29,571 --> 00:28:33,680
the reason people hate are so scared of 
public speaking,

622
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:37,820
evolutionarily speaking,
if you were in that position,

623
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:40,490
public speaking,
you speaking to hundreds of people,

624
00:28:40,491 --> 00:28:43,490
that meant that you were exiled from the
tribe and you were defending yourself.

625
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,170
Whoa

626
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:46,653
Shit.
So if you were ever like trying to get 

627
00:28:49,161 --> 00:28:50,660
people to like you,
it was saying,

628
00:28:50,661 --> 00:28:53,300
please don't kill me.
I didn't eat all the meat.

629
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,700
I didn't steal that thing.
Please spare me.

630
00:28:55,701 --> 00:28:57,320
Please spare me.
Oh my God,

631
00:28:57,321 --> 00:28:59,330
that makes so much sense.
So much sense.

632
00:28:59,331 --> 00:29:02,180
So when we're up there on stage,
the reason you feel that fear is because

633
00:29:02,181 --> 00:29:03,014
it used to be you were begging for 
forgiveness and not to get speared to 

634
00:29:05,511 --> 00:29:09,560
death or stoned to death or whatever.
It makes a lot of sense.

635
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,590
That's crazy because we always 
associated with being a leader who,

636
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:15,180
speaking to the tribe,
nope,

637
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,910
no,
please don't kill me.

638
00:29:17,911 --> 00:29:20,340
Please don't kill me.
Holy Shit.

639
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:21,510
Yeah,
that's what it was.

640
00:29:21,511 --> 00:29:22,344
And tribal times at the same thing about
like there was that article in the 

641
00:29:23,701 --> 00:29:24,534
Atlantic about how um,
loneliness is now is bad for you as 

642
00:29:26,701 --> 00:29:27,534
smoking because it used to be,
if you were living alone in an 

643
00:29:29,641 --> 00:29:32,130
apartment,
in a pod that meant you were exiled from

644
00:29:32,131 --> 00:29:36,260
the tribe and had no protection from it.
So your brain stops producing serotonin.

645
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,460
Endorphins,
you basically just get depressed because

646
00:29:38,461 --> 00:29:39,294
it's like you feel so unsafe and you 
feel so much anxiety designed to live 

647
00:29:42,011 --> 00:29:42,844
together because that meant protections 
before we had like alarm systems and 

648
00:29:45,551 --> 00:29:46,384
locks and shit.

649
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,040
Right.
Wow.

650
00:29:48,041 --> 00:29:51,150
That totally makes sense as well.
And it seems like the,

651
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,353
the more people get advanced socially,
like the more we understand each other 

652
00:29:57,011 --> 00:29:57,844
socially,
we more and more will understand like 

653
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:00,183
that there's all these causes and 
effects that go on inside of human 

654
00:30:02,981 --> 00:30:03,814
relationships,
on both sides that make things go well 

655
00:30:07,211 --> 00:30:08,044
or go bad.
And hopefully over generation after 

656
00:30:10,961 --> 00:30:11,794
generation of US studying this and 
paying attention to the way that we 

657
00:30:13,481 --> 00:30:14,314
behave and talk to each other.
Because I think people talk to each 

658
00:30:15,911 --> 00:30:19,390
other far differently today.
We definitely do in media,

659
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,253
right,
and it didn't make the 19 thirties or 

660
00:30:22,061 --> 00:30:24,700
forties or fifties.
It's like there's a very crude,

661
00:30:24,701 --> 00:30:25,534
rudimentary form of communication that I
think it's richer and weirder and more 

662
00:30:29,471 --> 00:30:33,940
aware now today and I think it's going 
to continue to get better and better and

663
00:30:33,941 --> 00:30:34,774
if it does,
maybe one day we'll get into a more 

664
00:30:37,541 --> 00:30:38,374
relaxed society place.
Like if we can ensure that more people 

665
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:42,453
are nice and friendly and helping it and
honest and helpful and less people are 

666
00:30:47,201 --> 00:30:50,140
dangerous and fucked up.
But instead of doing that,

667
00:30:50,141 --> 00:30:52,570
what we do is the opposite.
Will I put a bigger walls,

668
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:55,420
lock things down more,
separate ourselves,

669
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:57,230
ourselves further,
you know,

670
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:02,170
secure our position.
I think as a society,

671
00:31:02,171 --> 00:31:03,670
and this is total hippy talk,
right?

672
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:07,990
But we have to figure out a way to make 
less people live.

673
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:10,690
Sucky lives soon as you make less people
live,

674
00:31:10,691 --> 00:31:13,540
suck lives.
Everything becomes way less dangerous.

675
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,473
Right?
But like I was in Guatemala once and I 

676
00:31:16,551 --> 00:31:18,530
remember looking around and going,
what a sucky life,

677
00:31:18,531 --> 00:31:20,390
what a sucky life.
And then I drive past people.

678
00:31:20,391 --> 00:31:24,950
They're sitting around laughing with no 
teeth in hammocks in a shack,

679
00:31:24,951 --> 00:31:26,870
and I'm like,
why are they happier than me?

680
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,093
And um,
from what I gather it's because they're 

681
00:31:29,811 --> 00:31:30,800
together.
So it's like,

682
00:31:30,801 --> 00:31:33,050
so much of our communication is 
nonverbal.

683
00:31:33,051 --> 00:31:33,884
They say like 80 percent of our 
communication is nonverbal and I'm on 

684
00:31:35,361 --> 00:31:36,141
here texting,
texting,

685
00:31:36,141 --> 00:31:36,974
texting.
You're seeing the verbal but you're not 

686
00:31:38,061 --> 00:31:39,830
seeing the nonverbal of like,
you're safe.

687
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:40,664
I'm connected to you.
Or getting oxytocin for making eye 

688
00:31:42,291 --> 00:31:43,124
contact and hugging.
Like we're communicating more and more 

689
00:31:44,781 --> 00:31:45,614
and more,
but actually reaching each other less 

690
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:48,920
and less and less on a chemical or 
neurochemical level.

691
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:49,270
Right?

692
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:50,860
Yeah.
And you've got to figure the people that

693
00:31:50,861 --> 00:31:51,694
are living in a village or some third 
world country or they're living closer 

694
00:31:54,701 --> 00:31:58,120
to the land of less electronic 
stimulation,

695
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:02,070
less they're who they are as a person 
and where they're living their life is,

696
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:05,440
is fitting into the world that they live
in.

697
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:06,503
Right.
It's like those grooves I've already 

698
00:32:07,151 --> 00:32:07,984
been cut.
There's smooth and deep and everything 

699
00:32:09,401 --> 00:32:12,130
just slides into place.
Everybody's been doing it this way for a

700
00:32:12,131 --> 00:32:13,130
long ass time.
Yeah.

701
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:16,720
When do you start factoring in all the 
crazy shit that we're after dealing with

702
00:32:16,721 --> 00:32:17,554
just with traffic and the sheer number 
of humans clogged into this 

703
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:22,564
intersection,
just trying to move forward and 

704
00:32:23,981 --> 00:32:27,190
everybody being frustrated and honking 
and cutting each other off.

705
00:32:27,191 --> 00:32:28,100
And that is

706
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:34,140
brain doesn't know what a car is.
It makes sense.

707
00:32:34,211 --> 00:32:38,110
Like our primordial brain,
it's just a lion running across,

708
00:32:38,111 --> 00:32:40,240
uh,
the fucking horror,

709
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,233
you know,
it's just like things coming at you 

710
00:32:42,531 --> 00:32:44,450
quickly.
So we're kind of in fight or flight mode

711
00:32:44,451 --> 00:32:46,190
all the time.
And the phone is the sun,

712
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,113
right?
Our brain basically think it's just 

713
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:48,973
producing cortisol.
It's like we're constantly looking into 

714
00:32:51,111 --> 00:32:51,944
the sun all day and then we see just 
things coming at us in our periphery 

715
00:32:55,161 --> 00:32:59,090
constantly and it's depleting and it's 
putting us in fight or flight mode,

716
00:32:59,091 --> 00:33:00,920
which sets shuts down our frontal lobe.
Right.

717
00:33:00,921 --> 00:33:04,100
Which is like our feeling and decision 
making sound though.

718
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:05,920
What is it?
I remember reading this,

719
00:33:05,921 --> 00:33:06,754
but I don't remember what the answer is.
What is it about the disassociative 

720
00:33:09,701 --> 00:33:10,534
aspect of driving in a car that makes 
people aggressive to other people like 

721
00:33:13,631 --> 00:33:17,050
verbally and giving them the finger and 
get and the anonymity?

722
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:17,741
No,
no,

723
00:33:17,741 --> 00:33:18,574
I remember what it is.
What it is is they had concluded that 

724
00:33:22,031 --> 00:33:22,864
you're in a heightened state of not 
necessarily fear but reaction time when 

725
00:33:27,281 --> 00:33:28,114
you were in a car because you realize 
that you are going 65 miles an hour and 

726
00:33:30,911 --> 00:33:31,744
everything is happening fast.
You have to be paying attention to 

727
00:33:33,491 --> 00:33:35,620
everything.
And so in this heightened state,

728
00:33:35,621 --> 00:33:38,020
you're almost in like a heightened 
altercation position.

729
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:39,420
Like you're ready for anything,
right?

730
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:41,230
What do we got?
What do we got it you.

731
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:42,993
You're ready to go?
This fucking Dick had just cut me off 

732
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,740
like it's everything so ramped up.

733
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:48,623
But let me ask you a question because 
I've been in cars with people who are 

734
00:33:50,751 --> 00:33:51,630
just like,
oh sorry.

735
00:33:51,631 --> 00:33:53,520
And I've been in cars with people a 
little fuck you.

736
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:57,150
And to me it's like I feel like kind of 
every guy turns it into a sport.

737
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,593
You can do that if you let it get away.
You're competing and who's going faster 

738
00:34:02,201 --> 00:34:04,270
and that sort of thing like does that 
happen to you?

739
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,373
You can do that.
If someone's a total dick and you start 

740
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:11,530
falling into that,
it's always best to think twice.

741
00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:16,480
It's always best just relax and just 
avoid because it's not worth.

742
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:20,770
There's no upside on that sort of like 
involvement.

743
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:22,560
There's no upside on that.
K,

744
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:24,040
there's nothing been like,
fuck you.

745
00:34:24,041 --> 00:34:25,390
And been like,
that was a good idea.

746
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:28,300
There's nothing out of that.
There's no upside.

747
00:34:28,301 --> 00:34:32,770
But the downside is gigantic.
Actual violence.

748
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:34,930
Like you could get shot,
you could get stabbed,

749
00:34:34,931 --> 00:34:37,210
you get beat up,
someone could run you over,

750
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,193
you could get into some terrible 
position where you hurt someone and you 

751
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,840
have to pay for their medical bills and 
their legal bills.

752
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:46,680
It could be devastating to you.
Is there something like,

753
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:47,523
and you could feel terrible about the 
fact that he did it cause you did it in 

754
00:34:48,791 --> 00:34:50,800
the heat of passion when you weren't 
even thinking straight.

755
00:34:50,801 --> 00:34:55,210
Stupid guys do dumb shit all the time.
Changes their life.

756
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,290
I was in a,
uh,

757
00:34:57,410 --> 00:35:00,290
is it called Artesia?
That's a place in California,

758
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:05,000
California.
I watched a guy like two guys tailgating

759
00:35:05,001 --> 00:35:06,200
each other,
chasing some guy,

760
00:35:06,201 --> 00:35:07,034
fucking got out of his car with a 
baseball bat and like came in and they 

761
00:35:08,961 --> 00:35:10,640
got in a fight and I was like,
I'm going to leave.

762
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:14,680
There's a great video of that.
Some guy gets out of his car,

763
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:15,723
pulls a bat out of his car and smashes 
other guy's car and the other guy gets 

764
00:35:19,211 --> 00:35:20,800
out of the car,
grabs them,

765
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:23,560
gets them in a rear naked choke,
puts them to sleep,

766
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:26,500
pushes them to the side of the road,
gets in his car and drives off.

767
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:29,280
It's amazing.
There's no,

768
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,133
but I'm just saying is that I got into 
this and I know I was texting you about 

769
00:35:34,151 --> 00:35:36,280
that calcium storico thing.
That thing in Florida,

770
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,010
you've got obsessed with that shit.

771
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:41,010
I'm I want to make a documentary.
I've been trying for years,

772
00:35:41,011 --> 00:35:41,844
but I'm obsessed with our need for 
violence and if we didn't have violent 

773
00:35:47,221 --> 00:35:48,054
sports and competitive sports where we 
all just constantly be having baseball 

774
00:35:51,961 --> 00:35:53,490
bats in each other's windshield's all 
the time.

775
00:35:53,491 --> 00:35:55,110
Like we have an inherent need to be 
violent.

776
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:55,944
Right?
And do we need to just sort of control 

777
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:59,040
the reason I'm obsessed with Callisto 
Storico,

778
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:01,320
which if you don't know it's.
We've talked about it I think on the job

779
00:36:01,321 --> 00:36:02,154
before,
which is like it's bare knuckle boxing 

780
00:36:03,331 --> 00:36:04,164
football essentially,
but the month that they do it in 

781
00:36:05,521 --> 00:36:06,354
Florence,
there's virtually no crime because they 

782
00:36:08,581 --> 00:36:11,070
purge,
people purge and they get it out and not

783
00:36:11,071 --> 00:36:13,100
healthy ways,
but at least in controlled ways,

784
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:14,543
you know,
like are we designed to just be like 

785
00:36:16,111 --> 00:36:18,870
taking baseball bats to each other's 
windshields?

786
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:23,990
I think what it represents is a very 
valid release for primal instincts.

787
00:36:24,451 --> 00:36:25,284
Yes.
And I've been studying it most of my 

788
00:36:27,751 --> 00:36:28,501
life.
I mean,

789
00:36:28,501 --> 00:36:30,780
most of my life I've been paying 
attention to martial arts,

790
00:36:30,781 --> 00:36:33,660
studying martial arts.
I would have to be.

791
00:36:33,661 --> 00:36:38,661
I'm usually in the woods if I go a whole
day and I don't see someone fight,

792
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:41,120
right?
Like I see it every day constantly,

793
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:44,310
always.
I watch more Thai fights every day.

794
00:36:44,311 --> 00:36:46,830
I'll watch a wrestling match or watch a 
Jujitsu match.

795
00:36:46,831 --> 00:36:47,664
I'm constantly watching these things and
what I get out of all of it is what 

796
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:51,930
these people were doing.
Everybody's doing is,

797
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:54,360
first of all,
they're engaging in something incredibly

798
00:36:54,361 --> 00:36:56,970
difficult and when you engage with 
something incredibly difficult,

799
00:36:56,971 --> 00:37:00,930
it's a great way for strong willed 
people to find themselves.

800
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,000
They find themselves around this,
that,

801
00:37:03,001 --> 00:37:03,834
but it's you're,
you're finding validation through 

802
00:37:05,401 --> 00:37:07,890
incredibly difficult acts like,
I think I'm special.

803
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,720
How do I prove I'm special?
I prove I'm special.

804
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:10,573
Like choking out other trained killers.
I'm going to get to a place where I can 

805
00:37:14,191 --> 00:37:18,450
choke out all the experts like I'm not 
just choking out regular people.

806
00:37:18,451 --> 00:37:20,850
I want to be able to choke out the 
experts and those guys who do that,

807
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:21,953
they find themselves in the most 
exceptional minds and the most 

808
00:37:25,501 --> 00:37:26,850
exceptional bodies.
They all,

809
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,520
it converges together.
You cannot have one without the other,

810
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,593
but it's so recent that were not choking
each other out in the streets all the 

811
00:37:34,891 --> 00:37:36,870
time.
I mean like 100 years or something.

812
00:37:36,871 --> 00:37:37,704
I mean,
I was reading our that our eyes evolved 

813
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,093
to be sunken end because we were getting
punched in the face so much as a 

814
00:37:43,021 --> 00:37:44,850
species.
That's why our eyes are sunken in.

815
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:49,380
I swear to fucking God are our fists 
evolved to do this

816
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:51,400
so that we could use,
keeps going with all the.

817
00:37:51,401 --> 00:37:52,234
I poked me supervisor get thicker.
I would give up like a little bit of 

818
00:37:56,231 --> 00:37:58,210
vision to have like poke proof eyes.

819
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:01,050
The eyes are made of glass.
Yeah,

820
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,210
there was so weak.
I mean,

821
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,053
we're pathetic,
but so it's so recent that we're not 

822
00:38:05,361 --> 00:38:06,194
just constantly fighting each other and 
choking each other out in a socially 

823
00:38:08,361 --> 00:38:09,194
acceptable way.

824
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:13,340
But here's my thing.
What I've noticed and everybody has.

825
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:15,120
Look,
everybody's a work in progress.

826
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:15,601
You know,
I mean,

827
00:38:15,601 --> 00:38:19,110
you want to judge someone by an argument
that you got with someone 10 years ago.

828
00:38:19,111 --> 00:38:23,880
I think that's kind of ridiculous,
but we're all capable of weird,

829
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,420
uh,
aggressive behavior and mistakes.

830
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:28,343
But the people that I know that are 
involved in martial arts are uniformly 

831
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:35,190
some of the nicest,
most peaceful,

832
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,220
friendly.
They didn't

833
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,400
think they would be if they didn't get.
No,

834
00:38:39,401 --> 00:38:40,570
I don't know.
I don't,

835
00:38:40,571 --> 00:38:42,130
I would hope not.
That's what I know.

836
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:43,443
But it gives them something.
It gives them a feeling of security and 

837
00:38:46,391 --> 00:38:50,330
it gives them an understanding of ego 
because you lose a lot like the thing.

838
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:51,453
Most guys don't lose a lot of fights 
because they don't get in a lot of 

839
00:38:54,041 --> 00:38:55,270
fights.
You talk to an average person.

840
00:38:55,271 --> 00:38:59,170
I might've been in my whole life like 
street fights,

841
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:03,070
like three or four ever,
ever really.

842
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:03,963
All my fights I had were in competition.
So your thing is you learn how to avoid 

843
00:39:07,421 --> 00:39:08,870
fights.
Definitely.

844
00:39:08,871 --> 00:39:11,920
Well,
that drives you to need to do it.

845
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:12,813
It wasn't my choice like I was avoiding 
fights because I was scared of getting 

846
00:39:15,431 --> 00:39:16,264
my ass kicked and then I got into 
martial arts completely because I was 

847
00:39:19,031 --> 00:39:19,864
scared to fight people and I moved 
around a lot and I didn't really know 

848
00:39:22,751 --> 00:39:25,870
what I was doing,
but my point being that this,

849
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:27,840
this desire,
once you understand,

850
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:28,683
you really know how to fight,
all that shit goes away and you're 

851
00:39:31,451 --> 00:39:35,590
friendly and you don't have the need to 
overcompensate or prove anything because

852
00:39:35,591 --> 00:39:37,340
you proved it to yourself that you can 
do it.

853
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:39,063
There's a little bit.
As soon as I actually felt like I was 

854
00:39:41,501 --> 00:39:46,501
funny as a comedian talking into your 
net value,

855
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:52,990
that smoking thing,
I remember there was like 10 comics.

856
00:39:52,991 --> 00:39:55,630
They used to do that.
Like the nineties,

857
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:59,230
they'll Hashtag your banker.
Um,

858
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:01,350
I forgot what I was talking about.
Um,

859
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:03,130
I forgot what we're talking about too.
No,

860
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,233
I was saying like,
as soon as I felt like I was actually 

861
00:40:05,381 --> 00:40:06,214
funny as a comedian onstage,
I stopped trying to be funny in my real 

862
00:40:08,441 --> 00:40:10,510
life.
I didn't need to be right.

863
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:12,500
That makes,
I think it's probably pretty similar.

864
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:14,770
I think it's probably pretty similar for
guys.

865
00:40:14,771 --> 00:40:18,180
I think also they get it out of their 
system and also they don't have this.

866
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:21,970
A lot of male and male to male 
interaction happens just out of fear.

867
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:23,013
Like guys want the other guy to back 
down because they're fucking terrified 

868
00:40:24,851 --> 00:40:25,870
that they don't,
they don't want to fight,

869
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:26,973
but when people are not afraid of it,
it's not like a terrifying thing to 

870
00:40:30,071 --> 00:40:30,460
them.

871
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:32,740
There's more relaxation and less things 
happen.

872
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,540
Can I ask you a really weird question?
Sure.

873
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:38,830
It's illegal.
It's illegal to fight people.

874
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:42,610
Just in the street in California,
it is not in Washington state.

875
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:45,490
Washington state has something called a 
mutual combat law.

876
00:40:45,491 --> 00:40:46,324
Will cops will actually stand by and 
watch people beat the shit out of each 

877
00:40:50,171 --> 00:40:51,004
other if they agree to and as long as 
they know there's no such thing as like 

878
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:55,930
assault.
It is wild west Shit.

879
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:59,560
They literally.
Trenton state Seattle in Seattle.

880
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,890
What if it's man versus woman who I 
don't think you can do that.

881
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:03,770
Really?
No,

882
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:06,040
I don't think you could do that.
I don't think so.

883
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:09,330
And what if you're you?
You can't do that because you're allowed

884
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:13,530
to see a candle that's not real.
Although isn't there a thing registering

885
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,393
yourself as web and of that's real.
Fighters had to go to town hall 

886
00:41:18,191 --> 00:41:20,380
registered my hands.
I'm a human weapon.

887
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:22,300
My hands.
I've heard that.

888
00:41:22,301 --> 00:41:23,380
Why have I heard that?
Real?

889
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:25,000
Because people used to always say that 
you can't.

890
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:28,120
If you're you,
you're not allowed to fight the human on

891
00:41:28,121 --> 00:41:29,110
the street.
You go to jail.

892
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:31,510
But if I hit someone,
I'll get like an assault charge.

893
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:34,010
First of all,
everybody hits someone for no

894
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:34,843
reason.
It's going to go to jail unless it's 

895
00:41:36,261 --> 00:41:39,320
self defense,
but if you're vandelay Silva and someone

896
00:41:39,321 --> 00:41:42,650
doesn't know it's vandelay Silva and 
they go and pick a fight with him and he

897
00:41:42,651 --> 00:41:43,484
beats the fuck out of them.
He's not gonna get in trouble or some 

898
00:41:46,221 --> 00:41:48,260
sort of proof that these guys were 
starting a fight with them.

899
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:49,183
He's defending himself.
So if I attack Ronda Rousey at whole 

900
00:41:52,151 --> 00:41:52,984
foods,
she flips you in your breaks my neck 

901
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:02,120
with her finger.
She can she.

902
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:04,370
That was self defense 100 percent.
Yeah.

903
00:42:04,371 --> 00:42:06,680
You know,
it's not our fault that she killed me.

904
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:07,431
Well,
not only that,

905
00:42:07,431 --> 00:42:08,264
she doesn't know.
You might be some crazy black belt in 

906
00:42:09,651 --> 00:42:14,570
Brazilian Jiu Jitsu who's insane once a 
strangle or been lifting,

907
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:15,973
but there are.
I mean there's danger in interaction 

908
00:42:17,581 --> 00:42:20,720
with new people.
If you can get sued,

909
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:21,703
well,
you could always encounter someone that 

910
00:42:22,521 --> 00:42:23,354
knows how to fight.

911
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:24,051
When you,
when you're,

912
00:42:24,051 --> 00:42:27,230
when someone touches you or they're 
arguing with you are there in your face,

913
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:28,850
you have no idea what they're capable 
of.

914
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:29,803
They might be.
Even if you're a martial artist that 

915
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:34,700
they might be better than you are.
You don't know.

916
00:42:34,701 --> 00:42:35,534
No one ever knows what you're saying.
This is this crazy idea that somehow or 

917
00:42:39,531 --> 00:42:41,540
another you have to have your shit 
together to be a fighter.

918
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:42,583
I've known a lot of fucking crazy people
that were insane that we're really good 

919
00:42:47,631 --> 00:42:49,800
at fighting really.
Part of it though,

920
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:55,120
you have to be lacking.
Not spect approach to or St Pierre isn't

921
00:42:56,030 --> 00:43:01,030
George St Pierre is super present and 
kind and a fun guy to talk to.

922
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,060
A sweetheart just ultra,
ultra competitive.

923
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:05,571
Right?
Right,

924
00:43:05,571 --> 00:43:05,940
right.
Yeah.

925
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:09,480
He's like adrenaline addiction shit,
or when.

926
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:13,490
My point is he's not a mean person,
but there are mean crazy people that are

927
00:43:13,491 --> 00:43:14,780
also really good at fighting.

928
00:43:15,370 --> 00:43:16,203
The idea that only good people are good 
at fighting is a ridiculous know that 

929
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:20,833
you have to be always careful.
These hands and feet are registered as 

930
00:43:24,471 --> 00:43:27,530
deadly weapons in Guam,
Guam,

931
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,660
Guam.
You can do that at the bottom.

932
00:43:29,661 --> 00:43:30,494
There's a law about the,
like if you went to Guam and he 

933
00:43:32,811 --> 00:43:33,644
registered karate or judo expert,
who thereafter is charged with having 

934
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:41,060
used his art in a physical assault on 
some other person shall upon conviction.

935
00:43:41,061 --> 00:43:41,894
There have be deemed guilty of 
aggravated assault upon conviction 

936
00:43:45,381 --> 00:43:49,010
though that's a component that should 
be.

937
00:43:49,011 --> 00:43:51,400
I agree with.
You have to have been arrested already.

938
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:52,640
Well,
I agree with that.

939
00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:54,860
What I take,
this is how I interpret that,

940
00:43:54,890 --> 00:43:55,723
that if someone like say a Brendan 
Schaub decided to pick on some guy who 

941
00:44:00,231 --> 00:44:01,064
didn't know how to fight knowing that 
this guy didn't know how to fight and 

942
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:04,010
Brendan would never do that.

943
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:07,430
He's the nicest guy ever,
but beat the shit out of this person.

944
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:08,353
They should be charged with like an 
extra level of assault because it's not 

945
00:44:10,851 --> 00:44:13,160
just a salt.
It's almost like assault with a weapon.

946
00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:16,370
She told me that people come up to him 
and he'll be like,

947
00:44:16,371 --> 00:44:17,060
uh,
you know,

948
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:18,680
I used to fight and he's just like,
don't say that.

949
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:22,120
They instigate and sometimes you just 
have to leave DFP ever.

950
00:44:22,121 --> 00:44:22,954
I have people do that where you just 
have to like leave because sometimes 

951
00:44:24,561 --> 00:44:25,394
people are delusional,
but I've seen it happened even to Chuck 

952
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:28,333
Liddell.
I've seen people come up to him when he 

953
00:44:28,821 --> 00:44:30,620
was in his prime.
People are crazy.

954
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:32,010
There's always a certain ones

955
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:32,843
that people who come up to.
I mean as a comic people come up to me 

956
00:44:34,291 --> 00:44:35,030
and like,
what's up?

957
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:36,180
I'm like,
you don't want to do this,

958
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:38,310
don't do this,
don't do that.

959
00:44:38,311 --> 00:44:39,330
To like,
hey hooker.

960
00:44:39,331 --> 00:44:40,980
And I'm like,
don't try to be funny.

961
00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:45,120
I'm going to go well for you practicing 
that at home.

962
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,930
Then when I see her tonight I'm going to
look at yours.

963
00:44:49,070 --> 00:44:49,903
The things people say to me are so like,
what do you think by reactions and be 

964
00:44:52,841 --> 00:44:53,674
like,
you think I'm going to like crack up 

965
00:44:55,351 --> 00:44:56,970
laughing and be like,
here's my phone number.

966
00:44:56,971 --> 00:45:01,260
Like what did you just drop your needs?
How did you think that was going to go?

967
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:07,110
I don't think they think.
I think people also like maybe they have

968
00:45:07,111 --> 00:45:07,944
an idea of what?
Of what will be funny and I think about 

969
00:45:09,350 --> 00:45:10,183
a total of 15 seconds before they say 
it's shocking and my favorite has been 

970
00:45:15,181 --> 00:45:17,600
something that bores you with like a 15 
minutes,

971
00:45:17,850 --> 00:45:19,650
the longest vagina monologue of all 
time.

972
00:45:19,651 --> 00:45:20,484
Something just like terrible and awful.
They just talk about like traffic and 

973
00:45:22,231 --> 00:45:23,940
then they're like,
you can have that one.

974
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:28,770
Can I.
Did you ever notice like,

975
00:45:28,771 --> 00:45:31,290
oh no material

976
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:33,550
or like you're talking to someone super 
boring and they're like,

977
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:35,050
are you going to put me in your act 
like,

978
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:36,850
no,
you're fucking bombing.

979
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:38,530
Say something funny and I'll think about
it.

980
00:45:39,590 --> 00:45:41,130
No,
the worst.

981
00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:42,720
Every guy says that on dates.
They're like,

982
00:45:42,730 --> 00:45:43,620
we're gonna.
Put it in your act.

983
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:44,550
Wow.
Really?

984
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:45,383
Is that a part of the issue?
The Guy I'm dating has never seen me to 

985
00:45:47,371 --> 00:45:50,820
stand up.
That's what I'm going to do.

986
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:52,800
How long you been dating him?
Eight months.

987
00:45:53,590 --> 00:45:56,350
Keep them that way.
I think that's kind of a light.

988
00:45:57,450 --> 00:46:00,070
Never goes well.
I don't think guys love seeing girls and

989
00:46:00,071 --> 00:46:03,180
like an Alpha stance yelling about 
Dick's.

990
00:46:03,181 --> 00:46:08,181
They've sucked in the past.
I like to separate church and state like

991
00:46:10,321 --> 00:46:11,670
that.
Or do you think that that's delusional?

992
00:46:11,671 --> 00:46:13,530
That I can.
I don't think it's delusional at all.

993
00:46:13,531 --> 00:46:15,630
You've done it for eight months,
eight months.

994
00:46:15,631 --> 00:46:19,530
Why can't you do it for eight years?
Which is as long as I ever want to be in

995
00:46:19,531 --> 00:46:20,440
anything.
Yeah.

996
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:22,480
But it seems like it's totally possible.
Why?

997
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:24,570
I mean,
if that's what makes you comfortable and

998
00:46:24,571 --> 00:46:25,410
it doesn't give a shit.

999
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:28,680
I think comedy's for strangers.
I don't think it's for people.

1000
00:46:28,681 --> 00:46:30,600
You know?
My friends were like,

1001
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:31,650
can I come see your show?
And I'm like,

1002
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:36,120
that's not what it's for.
It's for complete strangers.

1003
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:37,530
It's not for people,
you know,

1004
00:46:37,590 --> 00:46:39,810
you just nailed it.
Oh yeah.

1005
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:42,900
Like if you're doing standup and someone
who you know really good is in the front

1006
00:46:42,901 --> 00:46:43,734
row,
like what are the front row is all your 

1007
00:46:44,431 --> 00:46:46,770
family?
I can't say that.

1008
00:46:46,771 --> 00:46:47,940
I can't say that.
I can't say that.

1009
00:46:47,941 --> 00:46:49,500
It's like I'm doing these shows in La 
and I'm like,

1010
00:46:49,501 --> 00:46:51,750
why am I doing la shows?
Because it's gonna be all people.

1011
00:46:51,751 --> 00:46:52,650
I know.
Everyone's like,

1012
00:46:52,651 --> 00:46:53,251
can I come on?
Like,

1013
00:46:53,251 --> 00:46:54,240
you can't.
Actually,

1014
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:55,493
I'm like doing a complete,
like you got to tune into everybody 

1015
00:46:58,141 --> 00:46:59,430
else,
but it's just like,

1016
00:46:59,790 --> 00:47:01,890
you're right,
you're not even thinking about.

1017
00:47:01,891 --> 00:47:05,200
Those are the people they may or may not
be an impediment in,

1018
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:06,173
but they're not going to enhance it.
They're not going to be a part of the 

1019
00:47:07,951 --> 00:47:08,784
normal crowd.

1020
00:47:08,830 --> 00:47:09,663
For me,
I'm always thinking in the back of my 

1021
00:47:10,571 --> 00:47:11,141
head,
oh no,

1022
00:47:11,141 --> 00:47:13,300
I can't say that I'm going to hurt their
feelings.

1023
00:47:14,650 --> 00:47:16,180
It's like you can't say anything because
you can't just be like,

1024
00:47:16,181 --> 00:47:17,800
oh,
because my fucking crazy family.

1025
00:47:17,801 --> 00:47:18,790
And then they're like,
where are we creating?

1026
00:47:18,791 --> 00:47:19,810
I'm set in.
Everyone's.

1027
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:20,933
Everyone's such a fucking narcissist.
Like it's like the worst when you're 

1028
00:47:23,201 --> 00:47:24,034
dating someone or whatever it is and 
you're like going on and on about like 

1029
00:47:25,761 --> 00:47:26,950
in this stupid guy,
and they're like,

1030
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:27,940
what's that about me?
I'm like,

1031
00:47:27,941 --> 00:47:28,990
no,
I made that up.

1032
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:31,220
It's not about anyone.
It's my friend told me this,

1033
00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:32,143
like everyone just has to like turn your
act into a war shock tests and 

1034
00:47:34,841 --> 00:47:37,150
everything's about them and I just 
can't.

1035
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:39,370
Okay.
I mean there's this unspoken shit that's

1036
00:47:39,371 --> 00:47:41,530
going on in your act.
It's me,

1037
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:44,530
no,
you're fucking,

1038
00:47:44,590 --> 00:47:46,330
you know,
this is so ridiculous.

1039
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:48,370
I don't have a problem with you doing 
calm.

1040
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:52,030
Really.
You work out or shit on stage.

1041
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:53,850
It's like,
well,

1042
00:47:53,851 --> 00:47:54,684
it's interesting because bill bird 
number talks about his wife on stage or 

1043
00:47:56,071 --> 00:47:56,904
he never talks about.
He says that she doesn't like when he 

1044
00:48:00,751 --> 00:48:02,850
talks about him or when he talks about 
her,

1045
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:05,800
like she drew a boundary about it,
which I think yeah,

1046
00:48:05,890 --> 00:48:06,723
makes sense.
And I think what you're saying makes 

1047
00:48:07,581 --> 00:48:10,100
sense to that.
It's the actual act of doing it.

1048
00:48:10,101 --> 00:48:12,020
You're doing it for people who don't 
know you.

1049
00:48:12,350 --> 00:48:13,910
You're trying to do a thing.

1050
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:15,360
I,
if I was a stripper,

1051
00:48:15,361 --> 00:48:16,194
I wouldn't want you to come to me.
It's so emotionally revealing and it's 

1052
00:48:18,901 --> 00:48:21,270
about vulnerability.
It's about like I'm going to talk to you

1053
00:48:21,271 --> 00:48:23,130
for an hour and then never see you 
again.

1054
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:25,680
They're completely makes sense.
It is a one night stand.

1055
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:28,480
But what about songs?
I feel like songs the same way too.

1056
00:48:28,481 --> 00:48:31,960
Like if you know someone really well,
like God damn like,

1057
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:34,570
do you really want someone to sing a 
song for you?

1058
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:35,853
I went to a wedding where it was two 
brides who was lesbian wedding and one 

1059
00:48:39,851 --> 00:48:43,510
of them sung to the other person and I 
had to get up and walk away.

1060
00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:46,990
So uncomfortable looking in her eyes,
singing to her.

1061
00:48:47,150 --> 00:48:51,280
I was crouched over.
I literally was.

1062
00:48:51,490 --> 00:48:54,050
I was sweating.
I,

1063
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:57,460
I mean I look like fucking the joker.
My Mega was.

1064
00:48:57,461 --> 00:49:00,100
I was so uncomfortable.
I think singing to me.

1065
00:49:00,101 --> 00:49:03,910
I would rather blow you making eye 
contact the entire time.

1066
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:05,413
Then have you seen to me,
I will put a gun in my mouth before I 

1067
00:49:08,891 --> 00:49:11,200
let someone sing a song to me.
Awful.

1068
00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:14,330
Disgusting.
I don't know why it.

1069
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:17,530
So what is it?
What about the human condition?

1070
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:20,630
How can we,
from a primordial perspective,

1071
00:49:22,890 --> 00:49:24,910
I just am trying to do.
I can't.

1072
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,970
Why is it so embarrassing?
Maybe if you're a good singer,

1073
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,980
this was a good singer too.
That actually made it worse.

1074
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:31,890
Yeah,
but even if you're a good sandwiches,

1075
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:32,833
you and this one person,
you're alone in your kitchen and they 

1076
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:36,310
start looking you in the icing and 
you're like,

1077
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:36,410
yeah,

1078
00:49:36,410 --> 00:49:36,891
hey,
hey,

1079
00:49:36,891 --> 00:49:38,990
hey,
cut the shit.

1080
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,410
And active aggression really is a very 
awkward thing to do.

1081
00:49:42,411 --> 00:49:43,244
Oh yeah.
You have to listen now because making 

1082
00:49:44,211 --> 00:49:45,044
eye contact.
It's just makes me a guitar and you're 

1083
00:49:47,161 --> 00:49:47,994
so comfortable.
You could look someone in the eye and 

1084
00:49:49,021 --> 00:49:49,580
say,
no,

1085
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:51,690
you've got to go around.
It's wrap.

1086
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:52,450
Can't do it.

1087
00:49:52,450 --> 00:49:54,010
Like something really intense.
Right?

1088
00:49:54,011 --> 00:49:54,844
Like,
what would it be 10 songs would sing 

1089
00:49:55,751 --> 00:49:56,250
too.

1090
00:49:56,250 --> 00:49:59,920
I'm like a Sam Smith Banger or like,
um,

1091
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:01,493
maybe some Elliot Smith.
Were you thinking about sticking the 

1092
00:50:03,421 --> 00:50:04,100
knife in your heart?

1093
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:06,290
It's just,
it's just,

1094
00:50:06,291 --> 00:50:07,370
um,
what is it?

1095
00:50:07,930 --> 00:50:11,150
Because we are designed music releases 
endorphins,

1096
00:50:11,151 --> 00:50:11,984
right when we listened to music.
But it's great in a small gathering 

1097
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:16,333
together.
I think we don't love on top of each 

1098
00:50:18,201 --> 00:50:23,201
other.
It's just our Kelly was wearing glasses.

1099
00:50:24,081 --> 00:50:25,500
He's wearing glasses.
It's different.

1100
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:28,310
I could do it in sunglass sunglasses.
He is

1101
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:31,160
Super Yogi.
I don't fuck with any of that shit.

1102
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:33,230
No,
I'm just not into that.

1103
00:50:33,390 --> 00:50:34,223
Interesting.
I did once I did it once on a radio 

1104
00:50:36,111 --> 00:50:37,610
station.
I say kiss song.

1105
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:38,980
How did that go?
It was great.

1106
00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:42,520
Really like fucking,
you know,

1107
00:50:42,521 --> 00:50:44,720
they,
they had this thing that they did on the

1108
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:47,120
Alice.
It was a radio station in San Francisco.

1109
00:50:47,410 --> 00:50:51,160
Yeah.
Alice was the Sarah.

1110
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:55,320
No name where the hosts of the show.
Those kinds of.

1111
00:50:55,610 --> 00:50:56,600
Yeah,
they have like a,

1112
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:59,090
another thing now.
Are they doing a podcast or something?

1113
00:50:59,091 --> 00:51:01,220
Probably.
I mean,

1114
00:51:01,490 --> 00:51:02,570
yeah.
What do you.

1115
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:03,433
What do you show more r Kelly.
She's like playing with his Dick while 

1116
00:51:05,391 --> 00:51:06,320
he's on stage saying,
oh,

1117
00:51:06,321 --> 00:51:07,154
the girl behind him playing with his 
Dick while he was onstage singing the 

1118
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:13,370
fan.
Understand someone just playing with you

1119
00:51:13,371 --> 00:51:16,910
before you're saying a dick.
That's so this girl is reaching up,

1120
00:51:16,911 --> 00:51:21,911
grabbing his dick while he's saying hand
him his balls.

1121
00:51:25,370 --> 00:51:26,840
Setting.
Beautiful.

1122
00:51:27,130 --> 00:51:27,963
Speaking real.
What are those small stokey while he's 

1123
00:51:30,561 --> 00:51:32,600
doing this in front of 50,000
people.

1124
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,250
Oh God,
look insane.

1125
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:35,960
Wait,
is that enjoyable?

1126
00:51:35,961 --> 00:51:38,270
Having someone just tell your dick from 
behind.

1127
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:41,000
I'd have to have it happen.
Especially in front of all those people.

1128
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:43,880
That would be uncomfortable.
Depends on how you do it.

1129
00:51:43,970 --> 00:51:45,650
Some people are really good at playing 
golf.

1130
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:47,240
Other people.
This is fucking.

1131
00:51:47,650 --> 00:51:50,980
They hit that meant to me,
what is what's going on here?

1132
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,160
Same thing.
I guess the.

1133
00:51:52,161 --> 00:51:55,220
He hands him a towel and wipe him off,
but he's got clothes on.

1134
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:56,930
I'll give you some volume on this.
I need to hear this.

1135
00:51:56,950 --> 00:51:58,940
What mental illness does he have?
All of them

1136
00:52:02,270 --> 00:52:03,800
get the good ones.
The bad ones,

1137
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:06,050
they cancel each other out.
He's doing great.

1138
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:07,810
He's just hitting the frequency.

1139
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:10,510
Getting out of this.
He's amazing.

1140
00:52:15,490 --> 00:52:18,460
I don't like this.
The Christmas tree is kind of sinister.

1141
00:52:18,630 --> 00:52:19,720
Come on.
This is beautiful.

1142
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:31,870
You got to just let it go.
Let it go.

1143
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:36,880
This is know about video.
This is beautiful.

1144
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:48,060
This isn't just the one time sweat off.
You just take off your coat.

1145
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:55,060
She's got her hand on his Dick and this 
is making me sexist against women.

1146
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:59,830
Look at your mother.
Must be very proud.

1147
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:02,170
Listen,
she's doing a good job.

1148
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:03,033
Everybody's happy.
I see a lot of love in the room and I 

1149
00:53:04,691 --> 00:53:06,370
see one hater.
Oh,

1150
00:53:06,371 --> 00:53:08,200
look at this right here.
She's grabbing.

1151
00:53:08,210 --> 00:53:09,610
Oh she.
She heard his dick.

1152
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:13,150
Why would you.
What did he do?

1153
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:14,140
She do.
Just grab,

1154
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:15,550
grabbing.
Crushed his balls.

1155
00:53:16,210 --> 00:53:18,130
She tried to snatch it and take it home 
with her.

1156
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:19,330
I feel like

1157
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:22,560
this took a turn.
So many amazing.

1158
00:53:22,890 --> 00:53:25,290
It's amazing.
That grabbed enjoyable.

1159
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:28,230
Not like that.
It's she highfive and bitch.

1160
00:53:28,231 --> 00:53:30,690
I'm still confused about that Dick.
She's like,

1161
00:53:30,691 --> 00:53:31,620
get over here.
I'm gonna.

1162
00:53:31,621 --> 00:53:36,510
Get it again.
Women are letting me down.

1163
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:39,210
Not all women.
You can't be on team woman.

1164
00:53:39,211 --> 00:53:40,680
That's crazy.
I agree.

1165
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:42,720
I agree,
but I get a little bit where I'm like,

1166
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:45,390
it's not.
You are not on the same team.

1167
00:53:45,391 --> 00:53:47,920
You're a human being who happens to be 
female.

1168
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:50,530
People get ridiculous.
I can't say women.

1169
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,160
That's great,
but I'm just like,

1170
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:55,710
I need everyone to class it up.
Everyone needs to just elevate our Kelly

1171
00:53:55,750 --> 00:53:57,810
dropping his dick in front of some 
woman.

1172
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:00,150
He's disgusting.
I mean probably drunk.

1173
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:01,393
When was that?
Was that recent exciting videos from 

1174
00:54:03,991 --> 00:54:06,170
December?
He's garbage real recent.

1175
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:08,160
He does that.
I think probably every show.

1176
00:54:08,190 --> 00:54:10,680
First of all,
how dare you say he's garbage?

1177
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:11,693
He has.
He has provided some of the best 

1178
00:54:14,371 --> 00:54:16,470
unintentional comedy in the history of 
the world.

1179
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:17,493
That's the job.
I don't like it when musicians take our 

1180
00:54:19,111 --> 00:54:19,741
job.
No,

1181
00:54:19,741 --> 00:54:20,320
no,
no,

1182
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:22,610
no.
She'll talk.

1183
00:54:24,090 --> 00:54:26,020
No.
What is that?

1184
00:54:26,021 --> 00:54:29,790
A song where he talks for like the 
entire song.

1185
00:54:29,791 --> 00:54:31,860
Beautiful Mama and the Joe Rogan 
experience.

1186
00:54:31,861 --> 00:54:34,830
Please don't make eye contact with me.
Even if we get pulled off youtube.

1187
00:54:34,831 --> 00:54:35,664
I don't give a fuck.
We can pull up youtube basically every 

1188
00:54:36,961 --> 00:54:37,860
video.
Anyway,

1189
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:43,140
so we're gonna get demonetized.
It's hard out there for a pimp.

1190
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:46,190
But you,
you gotta listen to this.

1191
00:54:46,230 --> 00:54:47,430
Gonna make me.
I'm going to play it.

1192
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:49,493
Play it,
play it.

1193
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:52,540
We're gonna play and we're going to 
comment over it and then we get called.

1194
00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:53,463
We lose a step so we'll,
we'll re upload it and then this is 

1195
00:54:56,131 --> 00:54:58,710
going to have to go out live.
All you Internet folks.

1196
00:54:58,711 --> 00:55:01,320
Just take chunks of this and save this 
part.

1197
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:04,860
This ain't going to climax.
Don't make eye contact with anybody.

1198
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:06,013
Don't look at me.
The profanity represents just how real 

1199
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:14,740
shit gets when you argued with your girl
and Shit to my.

1200
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:20,420
I gotta get me a drink.
He'd go give me a drink.

1201
00:55:20,421 --> 00:55:22,610
Me a shot.
Take me a shot.

1202
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:28,060
He's jumping off here,
so I'm just going to do it.

1203
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:32,470
I'm doing this for the fans that I know 
around the globe.

1204
00:55:33,650 --> 00:55:34,483
We'll talk.

1205
00:55:35,420 --> 00:55:37,830
Oh,
oh,

1206
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:39,193
wait a minute.
Calm down to the club with who is the 

1207
00:55:43,161 --> 00:55:47,150
happiest I've ever seen your job.
Listen to this man.

1208
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:49,493
Is that a landline to sit up here and 
argue with you about who's to blame Tom 

1209
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:57,393
Seeker only thing I'm trying to.
I'm trying to establish smoke free and 

1210
00:56:06,670 --> 00:56:11,280
say she saw me at a club with some other
beachy CFP.

1211
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:16,470
Was this you say that with other guys?

1212
00:56:17,930 --> 00:56:18,763
Does she stay?
There were other guys there with the 

1213
00:56:21,290 --> 00:56:23,390
other guys.
Well,

1214
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:24,333
tell me this.

1215
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:30,140
Well wait a minute,
let me finish one.

1216
00:56:30,950 --> 00:56:35,950
I've got the Martin Luther King Jealous.
No Man.

1217
00:56:43,030 --> 00:56:48,030
Some old bullshit when I'm just trying 
to have a good time smiling.

1218
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:09,730
Nobody.
No damn money.

1219
00:57:14,190 --> 00:57:15,023
Always running off at the mouth.
Telling your girl your motherfucking 

1220
00:57:18,071 --> 00:57:23,071
business.
They don't sleep with us.

1221
00:57:34,450 --> 00:57:39,450
We'll talk about bullshit.
That shit.

1222
00:57:55,590 --> 00:58:00,590
Anyway,
put

1223
00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:34,130
this girl.
This isn't a healthy relationship.

1224
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:40,040
Fuck me.
Fuck you.

1225
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:45,900
What was the best lyrics come back.
This is a game changer.

1226
00:58:47,570 --> 00:58:49,310
Game Changer.
That's out there,

1227
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:50,510
and that's not real.
I mean,

1228
00:58:50,511 --> 00:58:51,710
that's real.
That's real.

1229
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:54,230
That's a real song.
That's a real sore.

1230
00:58:54,231 --> 00:58:57,740
That's a non ironic real song.
That shit I changed my mind.

1231
00:58:57,741 --> 00:58:59,110
He's an artist,
an artist,

1232
00:58:59,150 --> 00:59:01,720
a visionary.
He's a performance artist.

1233
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:04,730
Leave your 20 year old at his house.
These goddamn visionary,

1234
00:59:05,150 --> 00:59:05,983
um,
that requires an amount of bravery that 

1235
00:59:08,031 --> 00:59:08,864
I'll never understand.
No one will yelling one side of a 

1236
00:59:11,961 --> 00:59:14,150
conversation because.
And humiliating.

1237
00:59:14,151 --> 00:59:14,984
I mean,
that's what a real fight would sound 

1238
00:59:16,251 --> 00:59:18,020
like.
And he'd say those other guys,

1239
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:23,780
the other guys they use of silence.
And that song is brilliant.

1240
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:29,090
It's art,
Art.

1241
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:30,640
That is art.
I'm,

1242
00:59:31,030 --> 00:59:31,863
I'm feeling so many different emotions 
simultaneously that I've never felt 

1243
00:59:35,031 --> 00:59:36,350
before.
It's repulsive.

1244
00:59:37,310 --> 00:59:38,630
Repulsive art.
It's like a,

1245
00:59:38,690 --> 00:59:42,920
almost like a disgusting punk rock scene
will.

1246
00:59:42,921 --> 00:59:45,890
It also made me examine a lot of my own 
beliefs.

1247
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:47,900
Like I'm,
I really like,

1248
00:59:47,901 --> 00:59:51,110
I have a lot to think about.
You need to know that that's real.

1249
00:59:51,111 --> 00:59:51,944
That's a,
there's a dude out there running shit 

1250
00:59:52,671 --> 00:59:54,800
like that.
I just said,

1251
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:56,660
oh,
have you heard this?

1252
00:59:56,690 --> 00:59:57,523
Really do tell.
There's been all these stories that are 

1253
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:02,090
Kelly us,
they're accusing him of having some sort

1254
01:00:02,091 --> 01:00:03,410
of a sex cult.
Oh,

1255
01:00:03,411 --> 01:00:07,890
I think I did hear about them from their
families that you tried to join you.

1256
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:08,970
I tried to join.
You have to do it.

1257
01:00:09,010 --> 01:00:11,110
What's the requirements?
Um,

1258
01:00:11,590 --> 01:00:13,550
uh,
a heroin addiction,

1259
01:00:14,290 --> 01:00:18,200
a lack of a frontal lobe,
no college education,

1260
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:22,020
um,
love of r Kelly holder of the towel,

1261
01:00:22,570 --> 01:00:24,570
the towel,
and you can be literate,

1262
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:25,553
right?
But once you hold a towel and a woman 

1263
01:00:29,001 --> 01:00:32,060
said she was under the spell of a master
manipulator are killer.

1264
01:00:32,270 --> 01:00:33,103
After watching that video,
I feel like I would actually like to 

1265
01:00:36,530 --> 01:00:37,363
join this call to question if you say 
that you were under the spell of a 

1266
01:00:40,611 --> 01:00:42,470
master manipulator.
But can I ask you a question?

1267
01:00:42,471 --> 01:00:44,600
Why do you need to start a sex cult?
Why can't you just get a girlfriend?

1268
01:00:44,970 --> 01:00:45,803
I don't know.
I don't need to sleep with a lot of 

1269
01:00:48,141 --> 01:00:49,310
people.
Can't you just,

1270
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:51,710
you're already a musician.
Don't you get to do that anyway?

1271
01:00:52,010 --> 01:00:52,843
You'd have to talk to our.
I do not want to speak for the man 

1272
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:57,200
because.
Yeah,

1273
01:00:57,230 --> 01:00:58,520
because I,
I,

1274
01:00:58,750 --> 01:01:02,670
you know anyone who I don't really fuck 
you.

1275
01:01:03,230 --> 01:01:04,170
Fuck you.
It's,

1276
01:01:04,870 --> 01:01:09,220
it's,
it's infinity infinity.

1277
01:01:09,230 --> 01:01:10,063
You can't argue with that.
We'll talk is banging your head against 

1278
01:01:11,871 --> 01:01:12,704
a brick wall.
You cannot win a fight with that guy 

1279
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:15,890
because he just repeats your insults 
back to you.

1280
01:01:15,990 --> 01:01:16,823
Yeah.
I don't know if he's really running a 

1281
01:01:17,361 --> 01:01:19,040
sex cult so,
but if he is,

1282
01:01:19,430 --> 01:01:22,820
why does anybody ever run into any 
popstar running a sex cult?

1283
01:01:22,850 --> 01:01:24,950
It's not what being a pop star is.
What does it say here?

1284
01:01:24,951 --> 01:01:27,470
This is kitty.
You gave me your number.

1285
01:01:27,471 --> 01:01:29,390
He said,
always refer to me as daddy.

1286
01:01:29,540 --> 01:01:32,900
Oh no,
that's not good.

1287
01:01:34,730 --> 01:01:38,420
Whatever we say baby during sex,
which is me,

1288
01:01:39,490 --> 01:01:44,180
but it does make sense that if that was 
your kid though,

1289
01:01:44,181 --> 01:01:46,330
you'd be freaking the fuck out your kids
in art.

1290
01:01:46,331 --> 01:01:47,164
Kelly's.
They strike me as someone who fights 

1291
01:01:48,410 --> 01:01:52,160
with a women.
I'm not into it.

1292
01:01:52,220 --> 01:01:54,770
I don't like fighting.
I don't think it's fun.

1293
01:01:55,130 --> 01:01:57,680
It's not necessarily.
Most of the time that's the point.

1294
01:01:57,681 --> 01:01:58,514
It's not necessary.
I no longer have the need to have those 

1295
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:04,100
chaotic arguments and people disagree 
all the time.

1296
01:02:04,101 --> 01:02:04,934
I've had a pretty heated arguments with 
some of my best friends and sometimes 

1297
01:02:07,790 --> 01:02:09,550
over ridiculous shit.
Right.

1298
01:02:09,740 --> 01:02:10,573
You know,
I think it's the same with 

1299
01:02:11,061 --> 01:02:11,894
relationships.
Like she'd never say something in a 

1300
01:02:14,151 --> 01:02:14,780
relationship.

1301
01:02:14,780 --> 01:02:18,660
Like people say things in relationships.
I feel that they would never say to your

1302
01:02:18,710 --> 01:02:21,210
best friend like that.
It's very rare.

1303
01:02:21,290 --> 01:02:25,140
That's interesting that you would like 
say something to your best friend.

1304
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:28,620
Like,
like a hurtful thing without her.

1305
01:02:28,660 --> 01:02:30,240
I mean at least me.
I think it.

1306
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:31,493
I don't want to.
I don't want to hurt my best friends 

1307
01:02:32,590 --> 01:02:33,423
from when I had good friends there 
acting a fool and it's like I have to 

1308
01:02:35,971 --> 01:02:36,804
say this uncomfortable thing and protect
you from yourself because what you're 

1309
01:02:38,581 --> 01:02:42,270
doing is stupid or dangerous and I feel 
like most men agree with that.

1310
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:46,710
But most men that I've talked to about 
fights with their wives,

1311
01:02:47,010 --> 01:02:50,730
a lot of guys have told me that shit can
get really ugly and you start like going

1312
01:02:50,731 --> 01:02:51,564
after the things that you know we're 
going to hurt the other person's 

1313
01:02:52,861 --> 01:02:54,720
feelings.
It's like woo.

1314
01:02:54,820 --> 01:02:56,670
I was like,
do you do that with your friends?

1315
01:02:56,671 --> 01:02:57,504
And they were like,
no,

1316
01:02:57,920 --> 01:02:59,860
don't do that with my friends.
I mean that's the whole point.

1317
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:02,250
But a friend is like,
I used to have weird,

1318
01:03:02,251 --> 01:03:03,780
acrimonious things with friends.
I'm like,

1319
01:03:03,781 --> 01:03:05,090
this doesn't make any sense.
Like,

1320
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:07,100
if I'm not fucking you,
I'm not fighting with you.

1321
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:10,230
Friends should be safe place should it,
unless you know,

1322
01:03:10,231 --> 01:03:12,030
like,
I mean I see a lot of friends of mine.

1323
01:03:12,390 --> 01:03:16,050
I'm going down in a blaze of glory on 
instagram with their crazy.

1324
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:17,533
Have you ever lived?
I've lost some friends to insert like 

1325
01:03:20,790 --> 01:03:23,610
oak trees are falling every day with 
the,

1326
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:27,060
just losing their minds with their 
documenting every last thing.

1327
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:29,280
And I've done a couple of interventions 
where I'm like,

1328
01:03:29,281 --> 01:03:31,380
hey,
you're starting to look crazy.

1329
01:03:31,381 --> 01:03:34,140
And it never goes well.
Trying to help.

1330
01:03:35,130 --> 01:03:37,200
Trying to just hold a mirror up.

1331
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:40,020
You're starting to look bad shit.
You gotta take your kids off.

1332
01:03:40,050 --> 01:03:42,960
You can't be filming them and saying 
their name and saying where they live.

1333
01:03:42,961 --> 01:03:44,310
It's just dangerous.
You know?

1334
01:03:44,370 --> 01:03:47,670
I run someone to tell me,
you would tell me if I was going crazy.

1335
01:03:47,671 --> 01:03:48,420
Right?
Well,

1336
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:49,253
there's definitely a lot of people that 
get addicted to the idea of posting 

1337
01:03:51,451 --> 01:03:54,690
things that are getting the feedback,
feedback.

1338
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:57,110
There's some sort of a weird serotonin 
thing that comes from.

1339
01:03:57,130 --> 01:03:57,963
Oh,
for sure.

1340
01:03:58,140 --> 01:03:58,951
Yeah,
definitely.

1341
01:03:58,951 --> 01:04:02,250
I mean it's like rats with the fucking 
whatever the skinner box and that.

1342
01:04:02,251 --> 01:04:05,370
Just like Pavlovian response.
I was at instagram the other day.

1343
01:04:05,371 --> 01:04:08,520
They said the average instagram user 
goes to instagram 35 times a day.

1344
01:04:08,630 --> 01:04:10,950
Oh Jesus.
30 five times a day.

1345
01:04:11,070 --> 01:04:13,530
That's more than once an hour.
It's nice to know that my average.

1346
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:15,720
Do you think you go that often?

1347
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:16,793
No,
I'm probably close to five times in a 

1348
01:04:20,521 --> 01:04:23,930
row and then not for like a couple hours
I follow a bunch of,

1349
01:04:23,931 --> 01:04:25,000
like really cool.
Um,

1350
01:04:25,020 --> 01:04:26,380
nature ones.
Yeah,

1351
01:04:26,430 --> 01:04:26,811
yeah,
yeah.

1352
01:04:26,811 --> 01:04:28,320
Me Too.
I know.

1353
01:04:28,321 --> 01:04:29,154
And like travel things and like now I 
follow doctors and surgeries and zip 

1354
01:04:31,921 --> 01:04:33,340
popping and that kind of shit.
Oh,

1355
01:04:33,380 --> 01:04:35,010
do you follow Dr Pimple Popper?
Yes,

1356
01:04:35,011 --> 01:04:36,330
of course.
She's amazing.

1357
01:04:36,410 --> 01:04:37,200
Yes.
Obsessed.

1358
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:39,930
I like when they take a tool and like 
push down and it comes out.

1359
01:04:40,410 --> 01:04:41,243
Why is that so satisfying?
Because as humans we're designed to 

1360
01:04:44,101 --> 01:04:44,934
groom each other because before 
antibacterial soap and fucking purell 

1361
01:04:47,190 --> 01:04:48,023
and stuff like we were,
we get endorphins from popping zits and 

1362
01:04:50,311 --> 01:04:52,100
grooming each other.
Wow.

1363
01:04:52,220 --> 01:04:53,053
Yeah.
Does your wife ever tried to like 

1364
01:04:53,780 --> 01:04:56,120
puppets and stuff on you?
Well,

1365
01:04:56,170 --> 01:04:56,960
yeah.
You don't.

1366
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:58,860
Yeah.
Well your skin is like kind of amazing.

1367
01:04:59,510 --> 01:05:02,490
But like ingrown hairs and stuff.
Does she ever want to like get stuff?

1368
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:03,360
Oh my God.
My boyfriend.

1369
01:05:03,361 --> 01:05:05,670
I'm constantly like in his,
he hates it.

1370
01:05:05,671 --> 01:05:06,504
He hates it,
but he lets me do it because he knows 

1371
01:05:07,351 --> 01:05:09,120
how and I tweeze eyebrows.
So what is it?

1372
01:05:09,121 --> 01:05:12,010
It's like a monkey thing.
You think like grooming and everything?

1373
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:14,460
Yeah.
So when we're watching Dr Pimple popper,

1374
01:05:14,461 --> 01:05:18,100
lance the zits and pus endorphins,
it's like little

1375
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:22,210
mini orgasms.
She's unapologetic with it to doctor.

1376
01:05:22,540 --> 01:05:24,880
She actually loves it.
I love.

1377
01:05:24,881 --> 01:05:25,714
I go on planes and go in and I squeeze 
my and then stuff comes out of every 

1378
01:05:30,911 --> 01:05:32,710
pore.
I love it so much.

1379
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:33,873
It's the greatest.
Go on planes and squeeze one off and it 

1380
01:05:35,381 --> 01:05:36,730
hits the Mirror.
No,

1381
01:05:36,731 --> 01:05:38,920
I don't have the ones that like are 
projectile.

1382
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:42,520
I wish I did glad I had those in high 
school or something in every one of your

1383
01:05:42,521 --> 01:05:45,040
fucking little pores and if you just 
like squeeze your skin,

1384
01:05:45,041 --> 01:05:47,450
it'll come out all at the same time.
It's Lauren.

1385
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:48,610
I love it.
And look for it.

1386
01:05:48,730 --> 01:05:49,563
Yeah.
In the high school used to get those 

1387
01:05:50,501 --> 01:05:53,120
volcanoes.
It's that like you'd be walking around.

1388
01:05:53,121 --> 01:05:54,400
It was like this white bubble.

1389
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:57,470
I used to have to get cortisone shots 
for that.

1390
01:05:57,680 --> 01:05:58,810
I used to get them.
Yeah,

1391
01:05:58,811 --> 01:06:00,320
like when I got my period they would 
like.

1392
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:01,273
You'd feel them and they'd like Hertz 
and you like can't even sleep on that 

1393
01:06:04,131 --> 01:06:06,440
and then you'd have to wait four weeks 
for them to surface.

1394
01:06:06,441 --> 01:06:07,140
So I would get a quarter

1395
01:06:07,140 --> 01:06:09,560
in Brighton.
The time when you're most vulnerable and

1396
01:06:09,561 --> 01:06:11,410
confused as a teenager.
Yeah.

1397
01:06:11,510 --> 01:06:12,343
Your body starts to fall apart.
The little basis for having acne as a 

1398
01:06:14,811 --> 01:06:16,730
teenager.
It's a hormonal thing,

1399
01:06:16,990 --> 01:06:17,823
sort of a reaction and the.
There's a bunch of different ways to 

1400
01:06:19,761 --> 01:06:22,730
mitigate it and a lot of them are.
These medications are really heavy.

1401
01:06:22,731 --> 01:06:23,140
They drive it.

1402
01:06:23,140 --> 01:06:23,980
I took,
oh,

1403
01:06:23,981 --> 01:06:25,810
I took acutane.
Oh,

1404
01:06:25,870 --> 01:06:29,380
I took acutane twice because I mean or 
something.

1405
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:30,693
I mean you met me.
What do you think the layman on the 

1406
01:06:33,491 --> 01:06:34,210
accutane?
No,

1407
01:06:34,210 --> 01:06:36,190
but there was this.
When you take it,

1408
01:06:36,191 --> 01:06:37,024
you have to take birth control 
simultaneously because you have to 

1409
01:06:39,581 --> 01:06:41,560
because it causes birth defects and 
fetuses.

1410
01:06:41,830 --> 01:06:43,270
So I'm like,
if this causes birth defects,

1411
01:06:43,271 --> 01:06:44,104
maybe I shouldn't be putting it in my 
bloodstream and the side effects are so 

1412
01:06:47,201 --> 01:06:49,960
gnarly.
I'm suicidal.

1413
01:06:49,961 --> 01:06:51,520
You have to sign this form saying this 
could.

1414
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:53,160
Oh,
sorry.

1415
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:56,500
Drove you to suicide.
Like anal bleeding is one of them.

1416
01:06:57,350 --> 01:07:00,490
Hey waiting.
You're giving that to a 14 year old.

1417
01:07:00,910 --> 01:07:04,780
My skin started flaking off in like 
croissant,

1418
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:08,800
like pastry sheets and my lips were like
bleeding.

1419
01:07:08,801 --> 01:07:09,634
It was a nightmare.
Your eyes start itching and drawing out 

1420
01:07:11,171 --> 01:07:12,730
like this isn't ready for the market.

1421
01:07:12,910 --> 01:07:15,270
Don't release this product yet.
It's not a thing now.

1422
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:17,410
Was it possibly like you took too much 
of it.

1423
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,610
You're on it for six months and that's 
just.

1424
01:07:19,611 --> 01:07:20,201
It varies.
Yeah.

1425
01:07:20,201 --> 01:07:23,470
Dries your skin out or like a hair 
starts falling out,

1426
01:07:23,690 --> 01:07:25,310
but my skin cleared up.
God,

1427
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:27,850
that's awful.
Behavioral effects as well.

1428
01:07:27,851 --> 01:07:28,550
Or Am I,
I mean,

1429
01:07:28,550 --> 01:07:29,291
yeah,
they said it's a,

1430
01:07:29,291 --> 01:07:30,400
it's a,
here's my thing,

1431
01:07:30,401 --> 01:07:34,390
it says increases your risk of suicide.
Oh Christ.

1432
01:07:34,420 --> 01:07:36,910
But when you're a teenager having bad 
skin,

1433
01:07:36,940 --> 01:07:38,770
it's like a chicken or an egg thing,
you know,

1434
01:07:38,771 --> 01:07:40,660
because all you want to do is fit in.
So I'm always like,

1435
01:07:40,661 --> 01:07:42,400
was it the accutane or was it the bad 
scan?

1436
01:07:42,910 --> 01:07:44,470
I don't know.
That's what they're arguing.

1437
01:07:44,471 --> 01:07:45,304
I guess.
Would you ever let your kids go on 

1438
01:07:46,211 --> 01:07:46,720
accutane?

1439
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:48,360
No.
No.

1440
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:49,770
I mean,
I wonder what,

1441
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:54,750
what natural alternatives there are?
Like I wonder if anything has to do with

1442
01:07:54,751 --> 01:07:58,290
the amount of probiotics you'd take.
I wonder if anything it has to do.

1443
01:07:58,430 --> 01:08:00,690
Any of it can be mitigated with oil 
glands.

1444
01:08:00,691 --> 01:08:01,920
Really.
It's genetic.

1445
01:08:01,921 --> 01:08:04,170
There's not a ton you can do about it.
But is that the case?

1446
01:08:04,190 --> 01:08:07,710
Does the genes express themselves 
exactly the same way?

1447
01:08:07,740 --> 01:08:10,830
Dependent upon environmental stress?
Uh,

1448
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:12,920
the amount of nutrition and you take in.

1449
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:14,850
I mean,
we're a coil plants.

1450
01:08:14,851 --> 01:08:15,260
I,
no.

1451
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:16,070
Can you shrink

1452
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:17,930
or grow oil glands based on Diet?
I don't know,

1453
01:08:17,931 --> 01:08:19,130
but it's not uniform.
Right?

1454
01:08:19,190 --> 01:08:21,240
So there's only a few in certain places 
like why,

1455
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:25,940
why do they want it's variable.
I have oil glands and large pores.

1456
01:08:25,970 --> 01:08:26,803
Right.
But it's not all your pores get 

1457
01:08:27,561 --> 01:08:28,221
infected.
Right.

1458
01:08:28,221 --> 01:08:30,380
So some of them do like why are they 
getting infected?

1459
01:08:30,830 --> 01:08:33,260
How much of that could be dietary,
how much of that can be changed?

1460
01:08:33,261 --> 01:08:35,360
Like what if you cut out dairy,
who knows?

1461
01:08:36,170 --> 01:08:37,003
There's probably a lot of things that 
are causing issues from what I gathered 

1462
01:08:41,601 --> 01:08:42,434
and this could just be all of the 
dermatologists trying to prescribe me 

1463
01:08:44,061 --> 01:08:46,510
more stuff,
but a lot of it is genetic diet.

1464
01:08:46,540 --> 01:08:47,373
I know that.
I wonder if it can be mitigated with 

1465
01:08:48,981 --> 01:08:51,980
diet or wonder if maybe poor diet 
exacerbates it.

1466
01:08:52,350 --> 01:08:52,970
Like,
I don't know,

1467
01:08:52,970 --> 01:08:54,830
probably it's just,
I'm just guessing,

1468
01:08:54,980 --> 01:08:58,480
but I just wonder if medication can do 
something for you to.

1469
01:08:58,520 --> 01:08:59,353
Maybe there's another way to do it,
to handle it in some sort of a more all 

1470
01:09:02,091 --> 01:09:02,924
encompassing way.
Deep systemic ones like that is just 

1471
01:09:05,661 --> 01:09:06,351
like,
well that is.

1472
01:09:06,351 --> 01:09:07,184
So those are the worst.
But I think it's probably a hormonal 

1473
01:09:08,961 --> 01:09:09,794
thing.
Like can you control your hormones with 

1474
01:09:11,091 --> 01:09:12,080
diet?
I doubt it,

1475
01:09:12,081 --> 01:09:13,790
I mean,
I'm sure it enhances,

1476
01:09:14,130 --> 01:09:14,963
it enhances your body's ability to 
produce hormones if you eat the right 

1477
01:09:17,511 --> 01:09:19,240
foods,
but uh,

1478
01:09:19,370 --> 01:09:20,990
I wonder like as a child,
you're,

1479
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:24,380
you're in such a state of flux and it 
might actually be,

1480
01:09:24,381 --> 01:09:25,214
I wonder if there's some biological 
basis for like the Darwinism of having 

1481
01:09:28,221 --> 01:09:31,040
really bad skin and overcoming it,
you know,

1482
01:09:31,041 --> 01:09:31,874
like what is the point of that in terms 
of your pecking order in the tribe of 

1483
01:09:35,241 --> 01:09:36,074
like having some kind of stigma and 
overcoming it and if you're a bit more 

1484
01:09:38,271 --> 01:09:39,104
of a bad ass,
like,

1485
01:09:39,370 --> 01:09:42,190
um,
that's interesting article.

1486
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:44,030
I don't Miss Scientific American or 
something that,

1487
01:09:44,090 --> 01:09:48,140
that people who had acne,
our over performers in life because they

1488
01:09:48,141 --> 01:09:50,330
had to overcompensate and overcome 
adversity.

1489
01:09:50,350 --> 01:09:51,670
The adversity overcome,
right?

1490
01:09:51,671 --> 01:09:54,680
Like the more resilient you are.
And um,

1491
01:09:54,770 --> 01:09:55,603
yeah,
it was just like something about you 

1492
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:59,570
completely partners.
Isn't that funny how something will come

1493
01:09:59,571 --> 01:10:02,000
up and it seems completely 
contradictory.

1494
01:10:02,090 --> 01:10:03,890
Yeah.
Then you stop and look at it and you go,

1495
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:04,850
oh,
okay.

1496
01:10:05,180 --> 01:10:06,770
They had to try harder.
So they got stronger.

1497
01:10:06,950 --> 01:10:09,200
But then again,
who's tracing the people who had acne,

1498
01:10:09,201 --> 01:10:10,034
who weren't successful,
no one's following them and they don't 

1499
01:10:11,751 --> 01:10:12,890
know about.
You know what I mean?

1500
01:10:12,891 --> 01:10:15,320
But is there a disproportion amount of 
people with acne that's succeed?

1501
01:10:16,310 --> 01:10:20,090
Apparently it was some study about like 
a ton of people who say,

1502
01:10:20,091 --> 01:10:21,680
I was a Dork in high school.
I had acne,

1503
01:10:21,681 --> 01:10:22,514
I was a loser,
and then they're like ceos of companies 

1504
01:10:24,321 --> 01:10:25,910
or performance or entertaining like Bill
Murray,

1505
01:10:26,330 --> 01:10:27,380
you become funny.

1506
01:10:27,380 --> 01:10:28,213
You sort of have to develop some kind of
personality to fit in because you're so 

1507
01:10:31,161 --> 01:10:34,890
stigmatized.
That line of thinking is a real similar.

1508
01:10:34,891 --> 01:10:39,830
It's similarly criticized to the line of
thinking that they use in like the movie

1509
01:10:39,831 --> 01:10:41,240
the secret.
Remember that?

1510
01:10:41,290 --> 01:10:43,360
I was just talking about the secret.
Yeah.

1511
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:44,273
Yeah.
The problem with that thing is not that 

1512
01:10:46,071 --> 01:10:47,960
the law of attraction isn't real.
Not if that.

1513
01:10:47,961 --> 01:10:50,420
If you don't focus on something and put 
your energy towards something,

1514
01:10:50,421 --> 01:10:52,970
you're more likely to achieve it.
Then if you don't focus on those things.

1515
01:10:53,030 --> 01:10:53,863
Right.
But the problem is you're only looking 

1516
01:10:54,981 --> 01:10:56,330
at winters,
right?

1517
01:10:56,420 --> 01:11:00,200
You're only looking at people who 
focused on following the losers.

1518
01:11:00,201 --> 01:11:03,110
There's so many of those.
If you just go over 300 million people,

1519
01:11:03,111 --> 01:11:05,660
it's easy to find a few thousand super 
winters like those people.

1520
01:11:06,110 --> 01:11:06,943
You find them and you say,
what made you so successful and they 

1521
01:11:08,751 --> 01:11:09,870
will tell you,
you know,

1522
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:14,280
I use the power of the law of attraction
and I wrote things and I had a vision

1523
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:18,330
board and I went towards.
But you also like took all the necessary

1524
01:11:18,331 --> 01:11:19,164
steps to make that happen.
You also were very disciplined and work 

1525
01:11:21,571 --> 01:11:22,404
hard,
but some people don't and you also 

1526
01:11:24,190 --> 01:11:25,970
thought it through correctly,
right?

1527
01:11:25,980 --> 01:11:27,960
There's a puzzle in front of you.
You solved it.

1528
01:11:28,010 --> 01:11:31,890
All of a sudden I'm the CEO of Exxon.
Obviously I started apple.

1529
01:11:32,070 --> 01:11:34,290
Like you have to figure that fucking 
thing out.

1530
01:11:34,291 --> 01:11:35,124
Just because you made it there doesn't 
mean you have like a valid roadmap that 

1531
01:11:38,311 --> 01:11:42,720
anyone can use and just think positive 
and think about the future and make a,

1532
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:44,160
you know,
some sort of vision map.

1533
01:11:44,161 --> 01:11:45,540
But it's definitely going to work out.
No,

1534
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:48,330
you have to do all the right things to.
And it's not going to be easy.

1535
01:11:48,350 --> 01:11:49,470
Yeah,
most people are going

1536
01:11:49,540 --> 01:11:50,373
quit,
but they kind of person who goes to buy 

1537
01:11:51,671 --> 01:11:52,504
the secret,
it makes a vision board is probably the 

1538
01:11:53,561 --> 01:11:56,050
same person who's going to do all the 
right things hopefully.

1539
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:56,430
Right.

1540
01:11:56,430 --> 01:11:57,263
But there's a lot of people that will 
try a new thing like that and they sort 

1541
01:11:59,161 --> 01:12:01,650
of start them out and then they bail on 
them.

1542
01:12:01,830 --> 01:12:05,160
And I used to do that for a long time.
Fuck,

1543
01:12:05,161 --> 01:12:05,994
I did that for a long time.
I would get like those anthony robins 

1544
01:12:07,950 --> 01:12:08,783
books.

1545
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:12,570
Do you remember Zig Ziglar?
Did he ever listen to that guy?

1546
01:12:12,571 --> 01:12:14,220
He was like one of those.
That was a rich one though,

1547
01:12:14,221 --> 01:12:15,054
right?
It's like dreaming and become rich or 

1548
01:12:16,261 --> 01:12:19,500
some shit.
We know how to influence people.

1549
01:12:20,370 --> 01:12:22,110
I don't remember.
Zig Ziglar.

1550
01:12:22,111 --> 01:12:24,630
He was like something positive thinking 
bullshit.

1551
01:12:24,631 --> 01:12:27,510
I know it sounds like a English pop 
star,

1552
01:12:27,540 --> 01:12:29,030
but you mean you would start?
Wait.

1553
01:12:29,130 --> 01:12:32,120
So you would start these inspirational 
start these programs.

1554
01:12:32,370 --> 01:12:34,070
Stop fucking bail on it.
I just,

1555
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:35,113
for whatever reason,
I never completely discipline myself 

1556
01:12:37,281 --> 01:12:39,800
with any,
any sort of self help program.

1557
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:41,570
I would start them out and then I'd bail
on him.

1558
01:12:42,050 --> 01:12:43,400
Yeah,
but it's like everybody has a different.

1559
01:12:43,450 --> 01:12:44,061
Like,
I mean,

1560
01:12:44,061 --> 01:12:46,790
do you feel like your training is kind 
of that now?

1561
01:12:47,340 --> 01:12:49,620
Yeah,
but I think even then like it was just a

1562
01:12:49,830 --> 01:12:54,830
matter of me just developing as a person
and being able to understand the process

1563
01:12:56,401 --> 01:12:58,680
of disciplining myself better because I 
was,

1564
01:12:58,740 --> 01:13:00,840
I was never very disciplined when I was 
younger.

1565
01:13:00,841 --> 01:13:03,660
I would just get obsessed with things 
and I would do them because that's all I

1566
01:13:03,661 --> 01:13:04,494
wanted to do all the time.
Like it never felt like discipline 

1567
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:08,220
because it felt like this was something 
I wanted to do.

1568
01:13:08,310 --> 01:13:09,143
Well,
productivity incorporation makes 

1569
01:13:09,820 --> 01:13:10,770
dopamine,
right?

1570
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:15,060
So I had to learn after the fact how to 
be disciplined.

1571
01:13:15,330 --> 01:13:17,010
Discipline is doing a bunch of stuff.
I don't want it.

1572
01:13:17,060 --> 01:13:20,020
You strike me as.
I mean one of the most disciplined.

1573
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:22,030
I mean you're certainly one of the most 
people I know.

1574
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:24,790
I know.
More disciplined people than me.

1575
01:13:24,850 --> 01:13:25,571
Really?
Yeah,

1576
01:13:25,571 --> 01:13:26,650
for sure.
Wow.

1577
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:27,633
My friend Cameron Hanes,
I talk about them too much on the 

1578
01:13:29,111 --> 01:13:30,340
podcast.
People thinking we're gay for you.

1579
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:33,140
Polar bear.

1580
01:13:33,140 --> 01:13:34,820
Well,
he's the guy who taught me at a bow hunt

1581
01:13:35,170 --> 01:13:36,003
and he runs ultra marathons.
He runs any works fulltime job and as a 

1582
01:13:38,991 --> 01:13:43,010
family he runs a marathon a day.
You could follow him on instagram.

1583
01:13:43,150 --> 01:13:44,130
Yup.
Follow minutes.

1584
01:13:44,290 --> 01:13:47,300
Pull up his instagram story.
He lives in Eugene,

1585
01:13:47,301 --> 01:13:50,420
Oregon and he runs the Mount Pisgah is 
the the mountain.

1586
01:13:50,700 --> 01:13:51,533
That's crazy.
He's a fucking savage and I think 

1587
01:13:53,641 --> 01:13:57,210
there's something to be said though,
like I'm pretty disciplined,

1588
01:13:57,211 --> 01:13:59,460
but I think my next step is to be like,
you know what?

1589
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:00,473
Let things be sloppy.
Wake up and don't know where you're 

1590
01:14:02,071 --> 01:14:05,340
going to fucking do because I am just so
attached to a rigid control.

1591
01:14:05,430 --> 01:14:06,263
Well here's the thing though,
as a comic that fuck off instinct is a 

1592
01:14:10,141 --> 01:14:12,220
good one.
It's good to have because

1593
01:14:12,220 --> 01:14:13,053
fuck off is where the ideas come from.
Like I only feel like I can do that 

1594
01:14:15,740 --> 01:14:16,840
onstage.
This is crazy.

1595
01:14:16,841 --> 01:14:17,674
Fucker.
He runs goddamn marathon a day and I'm 

1596
01:14:19,451 --> 01:14:20,890
not kidding.
Nope,

1597
01:14:22,010 --> 01:14:23,170
definitely unhealthy.
He doesn't care.

1598
01:14:23,530 --> 01:14:26,650
He's training for something called the 
Moab to 40,

1599
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:31,830
where it's 238 miles of running and you 
run them through the.

1600
01:14:32,350 --> 01:14:34,870
Yup.
Is that takes more than three days?

1601
01:14:35,110 --> 01:14:36,610
Yeah,
it takes more than three days.

1602
01:14:36,790 --> 01:14:37,571
He did two.
Oh,

1603
01:14:37,571 --> 01:14:39,340
five already.
Does he run in sneakers?

1604
01:14:39,580 --> 01:14:42,010
Yeah.
Under armour runs in these things called

1605
01:14:42,011 --> 01:14:42,844
fat tires.
They've got like a good amount of 

1606
01:14:43,691 --> 01:14:45,700
cushioning to them because the amount of
pounding,

1607
01:14:45,701 --> 01:14:47,890
you're kind of constantly do it.
He likes it that way.

1608
01:14:48,220 --> 01:14:49,053
It's just like he's talking to you.
You're talking to extreme volume of 

1609
01:14:52,151 --> 01:14:55,120
running.
I mean it's just insane or just.

1610
01:14:55,180 --> 01:14:56,013
That can't be great.
It's fine running on pavement and he's 

1611
01:14:57,730 --> 01:14:59,280
running on sometimes runs on pavements.

1612
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:00,113
Sometimes he runs on the road.
I mean he'll run early in the morning 

1613
01:15:01,481 --> 01:15:02,850
near his house,
you know,

1614
01:15:02,860 --> 01:15:04,720
but like this is the lab two.
Oh,

1615
01:15:04,721 --> 01:15:07,720
five to 2:30.
Two 40.

1616
01:15:07,750 --> 01:15:12,750
We'll have 240.
I've heard it called the 2:40.

1617
01:15:13,180 --> 01:15:15,670
I think they changed it to the to 40.
They were calling it the $200.

1618
01:15:15,671 --> 01:15:19,810
You get paid what is the question?
But look at the fucking scenery and look

1619
01:15:19,811 --> 01:15:21,960
what happens if you slip,
you're looking down,

1620
01:15:21,970 --> 01:15:25,630
you're not enjoying this.
Look if you fell like goodbye,

1621
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:28,180
see you.
No one,

1622
01:15:28,420 --> 01:15:30,940
no one is surviving.
CanNot help you,

1623
01:15:30,941 --> 01:15:31,390
sir.
No,

1624
01:15:31,390 --> 01:15:34,480
there will be no trump care that gets 
you out of that crevice in between those

1625
01:15:34,481 --> 01:15:35,860
rocks.
So this is,

1626
01:15:37,290 --> 01:15:40,120
and this is for four days,
more than three days.

1627
01:15:40,121 --> 01:15:41,770
I mean they,
they stop and eat.

1628
01:15:41,890 --> 01:15:42,880
Yeah,
you stopped.

1629
01:15:42,910 --> 01:15:46,370
They get like a snack,
a but the strongest after ours,

1630
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:47,320
they keep running.

1631
01:15:47,470 --> 01:15:49,300
They don't go to sleep.
How many runners?

1632
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:51,310
I don't know.
It's interesting.

1633
01:15:51,311 --> 01:15:55,030
I think he said a hundred.
Entered the 200.

1634
01:15:55,031 --> 01:15:58,000
The big $200.
And he said 45 completed it.

1635
01:15:58,001 --> 01:15:59,680
I think those are the numbers.
I don't remember.

1636
01:15:59,681 --> 01:16:00,430
40th five.
Complete.

1637
01:16:00,430 --> 01:16:04,240
And what is the main element of someone 
that completes this?

1638
01:16:04,270 --> 01:16:07,840
Is it mental or physical?
It's mental.

1639
01:16:07,870 --> 01:16:09,520
It's mental tenacity.
Because first of all,

1640
01:16:09,521 --> 01:16:12,970
the physical is involved.
Like you certainly have to be physically

1641
01:16:12,971 --> 01:16:13,804
tough to do this,
but the physical toughness is most of 

1642
01:16:16,271 --> 01:16:19,080
the time dictated by your mental 
toughness.

1643
01:16:19,081 --> 01:16:21,460
Like the navy seals that make it are 
never the biggest or the strongest.

1644
01:16:21,461 --> 01:16:22,360
Australia,
it's always like,

1645
01:16:22,670 --> 01:16:25,850
you know David Goggins,
that ultra marathon runner,

1646
01:16:25,890 --> 01:16:29,470
navy seal character who's like a famous,
a ultra marathon athlete.

1647
01:16:29,471 --> 01:16:34,170
He always says that people quit at 40 
percent and that yeah,

1648
01:16:34,280 --> 01:16:36,070
most people quit at 40 percent.

1649
01:16:36,100 --> 01:16:38,440
Forty percent of the kids probably the 
place where you get to go.

1650
01:16:38,441 --> 01:16:39,490
Like,
I didn't fail.

1651
01:16:39,491 --> 01:16:40,650
I stopped when.
No,

1652
01:16:40,660 --> 01:16:42,160
you get to go to.
I can't do this anymore.

1653
01:16:42,161 --> 01:16:43,120
I gotta stop.
I gotta stop.

1654
01:16:43,121 --> 01:16:43,954
I gotta stop.
And that's 40 percent of what you're 

1655
01:16:45,041 --> 01:16:47,430
actually capable of.
So where does mental toughness?

1656
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:49,420
I mean it comes from adversity at a 
young age,

1657
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:50,770
right?
And overcome Ken,

1658
01:16:50,771 --> 01:16:52,510
but there's no recipe for it,
right?

1659
01:16:52,511 --> 01:16:56,290
You could decide that you don't like 
being a pussy at 18.

1660
01:16:56,570 --> 01:16:57,403
I just started doing Jujitsu and become 
like one of the hardest trainers in the 

1661
01:17:00,011 --> 01:17:00,844
real.
You escalate who you are and who you 

1662
01:17:01,811 --> 01:17:03,910
become and become some world champions.
Jujitsu burst.

1663
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:06,610
It's been done a bunch of times,
but a bunch of different guys.

1664
01:17:06,910 --> 01:17:10,100
A lot of like worlds Jujitsu Champs,
that kind of Nerdy,

1665
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:12,500
Geeky book type characters.
Really amazing.

1666
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:13,460
Yeah.
Crazy.

1667
01:17:13,850 --> 01:17:15,400
And they,
they become these like

1668
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:17,600
when you are studying,
I mean it is like you.

1669
01:17:17,610 --> 01:17:22,130
It's so precise and it's like the same.
It's geometry and math kind.

1670
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:23,240
The nerd,
right?

1671
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:25,560
There's definitely an equation,
right?

1672
01:17:25,561 --> 01:17:27,900
There's definitely some sort of an 
interactive equation going on,

1673
01:17:27,930 --> 01:17:28,763
but it's also incredibly physical so you
get away with all the physical anxiety 

1674
01:17:32,311 --> 01:17:34,140
and all the bullshit that most people 
carry around with them.

1675
01:17:34,141 --> 01:17:36,270
You talk to people like after training 
or after class,

1676
01:17:36,271 --> 01:17:40,080
everybody like so chilled out,
so relaxed because they just went to war

1677
01:17:40,081 --> 01:17:43,190
for an hour and a half.
Everybody's like so chill and afterwards

1678
01:17:43,191 --> 01:17:44,820
I like the funnest guys to hang out 
with.

1679
01:17:44,850 --> 01:17:45,683
Go to dinner and laugh and joke around 
and what happens if those people don't 

1680
01:17:48,571 --> 01:17:49,404
do it for a month?
They get itchy every time you get 

1681
01:17:51,451 --> 01:17:52,284
injured.
A lot of guys get injured again because 

1682
01:17:54,361 --> 01:17:56,730
they'll get a surgery and then go into 
quick.

1683
01:17:57,480 --> 01:17:58,300
Super common

1684
01:17:58,300 --> 01:18:00,310
because they need that.
You just want to do it.

1685
01:18:00,311 --> 01:18:01,144
You miss it so bad.
Can you go without doing standup before 

1686
01:18:02,801 --> 01:18:05,440
you start,
like doing bits for your wife?

1687
01:18:06,790 --> 01:18:08,650
I never do that.
She'd never tolerated.

1688
01:18:09,210 --> 01:18:11,830
But um,
I could probably go.

1689
01:18:11,860 --> 01:18:13,300
I mean,
I've gone a month.

1690
01:18:13,470 --> 01:18:14,303
Yeah.
But I didn't do that for as long as 

1691
01:18:16,030 --> 01:18:17,880
you've gone since you started?
Yeah.

1692
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:19,000
Wow.
Yeah.

1693
01:18:19,630 --> 01:18:21,310
Um,
that was a long time ago.

1694
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:24,400
I just did it because I was,
I moved in,

1695
01:18:24,401 --> 01:18:25,234
I settled into new place and I was uh,
doing a lot of stuff for the UFC when I 

1696
01:18:30,591 --> 01:18:32,980
was traveling a lot and I was like,
you know what,

1697
01:18:33,010 --> 01:18:34,530
I'm just going to just do nothing for 
them

1698
01:18:34,580 --> 01:18:37,380
doing ufc stuff.
I get so fascinated by the,

1699
01:18:37,381 --> 01:18:41,390
like our need for visibility and like 
how much do I need and whereas this shit

1700
01:18:41,391 --> 01:18:45,770
coming from and do I exist if I'm not on
like I need to work on that thing.

1701
01:18:46,070 --> 01:18:48,500
Do we exist when we're not fucking 
documented?

1702
01:18:48,860 --> 01:18:49,693
And um,
because I sort of took some time off of 

1703
01:18:51,021 --> 01:18:52,880
being on TV and stuff and then I started
being like,

1704
01:18:52,881 --> 01:18:54,050
do I still exist?
Does anyone,

1705
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:54,913
you know?
And because I wasn't seeing a lot as a 

1706
01:18:56,211 --> 01:18:59,100
kid,
but it's like doing ufc where you're,

1707
01:18:59,140 --> 01:19:00,710
you're being heard,
you're being seen,

1708
01:19:00,711 --> 01:19:02,800
you're valuable.
People love you,

1709
01:19:02,801 --> 01:19:03,634
you know?
Is that the same reward centers in your 

1710
01:19:06,261 --> 01:19:07,360
brain is performing stands?

1711
01:19:07,490 --> 01:19:08,151
No.
No,

1712
01:19:08,151 --> 01:19:09,590
it's totally different.
It's,

1713
01:19:09,591 --> 01:19:10,424
um,
I'm a representative when I'm doing the 

1714
01:19:12,291 --> 01:19:16,670
UFC has almost nothing to do with me.
The only thing that has to do with me,

1715
01:19:17,300 --> 01:19:18,280
it is true.
It was true.

1716
01:19:18,290 --> 01:19:21,080
The officiant auto stuff.
Honestly.

1717
01:19:21,110 --> 01:19:25,790
All I'm the one without their,
the fight without that,

1718
01:19:26,060 --> 01:19:27,770
what I do is useless.
Right.

1719
01:19:27,771 --> 01:19:28,604
So all I'm doing is trying to use my 
vocabulary and my creativity in my 

1720
01:19:31,791 --> 01:19:33,890
understanding what they're doing to best
represent it.

1721
01:19:33,980 --> 01:19:36,200
Right.
To honor their hard work.

1722
01:19:36,260 --> 01:19:40,580
And so that's what I feel like that is.
So that's so not like I've,

1723
01:19:40,710 --> 01:19:42,050
I tried to keep myself

1724
01:19:43,290 --> 01:19:44,510
in.
Right,

1725
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:45,353
right.
I mean opinions on tactics and stuff 

1726
01:19:47,551 --> 01:19:49,950
like that.
It's not like you're a creative point of

1727
01:19:49,951 --> 01:19:50,280
view.

1728
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:50,940
Sure.
Yeah,

1729
01:19:50,940 --> 01:19:51,311
yeah,
yeah.

1730
01:19:51,311 --> 01:19:52,144
I mean it's just my perspective on 
performances and the character and the 

1731
01:19:55,951 --> 01:19:57,710
different interactions between these 
different

1732
01:19:57,830 --> 01:20:01,050
people's.
Your human for understanding the science

1733
01:20:01,051 --> 01:20:03,950
and stuff,
but you're not infusing your incendiary.

1734
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:06,520
It's just a very different feeling than 
being stand up.

1735
01:20:06,540 --> 01:20:07,373
Like when I go do standup,
it's like I'm going to go and I'm going 

1736
01:20:09,141 --> 01:20:09,931
to do my act.
Like,

1737
01:20:09,931 --> 01:20:10,711
Hey,
here we go,

1738
01:20:10,711 --> 01:20:11,550
what's up?
How's it?

1739
01:20:11,570 --> 01:20:13,500
And it's about me interacting with 
people.

1740
01:20:13,770 --> 01:20:17,070
Whereas like doing the USC is really 
just about being a representative.

1741
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:18,193
I'm a scientist.
I mean you're kind of a more of like an 

1742
01:20:20,770 --> 01:20:21,603
yeah,
an analysts,

1743
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:22,351
right?
I'm just,

1744
01:20:22,351 --> 01:20:25,350
I'm trying to.
I've seen so many of these things.

1745
01:20:25,351 --> 01:20:25,920
I'm like,
what?

1746
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:27,100
What does this represent?
Oh,

1747
01:20:27,101 --> 01:20:29,790
I know this code.
This code means left high kicks coming,

1748
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,890
you know he's moving this,
he's lifting his leg.

1749
01:20:31,891 --> 01:20:33,770
I see where it's coming and because 
scaleio is dropping his hands out.

1750
01:20:33,771 --> 01:20:37,770
There it is and you call it and it's,
it's representation.

1751
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:39,170
So it's very different than doing

1752
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:40,133
athletes will start or have they already
started getting elective surgeries when 

1753
01:20:43,351 --> 01:20:44,400
they don't have injuries.

1754
01:20:45,130 --> 01:20:45,963
There's only a few that I've ever heard 
of that think that that's willing to do 

1755
01:20:49,271 --> 01:20:50,104
that.
And Brody Stevens actually told me that 

1756
01:20:51,401 --> 01:20:52,234
was wrong.
One of them was a Tommy John Surgery 

1757
01:20:54,130 --> 01:20:56,040
where it apparently makes you able to 
pitch.

1758
01:20:56,740 --> 01:20:58,340
A lot of those guys I think are getting 
it,

1759
01:20:58,341 --> 01:20:59,174
but I thought it was.
You get it when you need it when your 

1760
01:21:00,770 --> 01:21:01,570
shoulders.
Fuck

1761
01:21:01,570 --> 01:21:02,403
right.
I had read the people were getting an 

1762
01:21:03,341 --> 01:21:05,360
elective.
Brody said that was bullshit.

1763
01:21:05,420 --> 01:21:06,253
So

1764
01:21:06,410 --> 01:21:07,243
person three get one knee.
He did one knee and then he did the 

1765
01:21:10,321 --> 01:21:12,660
other one just as rg three.
That guy from.

1766
01:21:12,780 --> 01:21:14,250
Am I saying that right?
Quarterback,

1767
01:21:14,490 --> 01:21:16,100
quarterback of the Redskins game?
Yeah.

1768
01:21:16,110 --> 01:21:19,680
Didn't he get an elective knee surgery?
Just because they can improve your knee?

1769
01:21:20,140 --> 01:21:21,440
Yeah.
When it's not sure.

1770
01:21:21,540 --> 01:21:23,080
Yeah.
I have not heard this at all.

1771
01:21:23,100 --> 01:21:25,140
That he got one knee done because he had
to.

1772
01:21:25,141 --> 01:21:25,974
The running quarterback guy.
I know nothing about sports running 

1773
01:21:30,121 --> 01:21:35,121
quarterback guy that runs with the guy.
He was on the redskins.

1774
01:21:37,620 --> 01:21:40,260
Right.
I've never heard of someone doing that.

1775
01:21:40,261 --> 01:21:41,360
I don't know.
I don't know.

1776
01:21:41,490 --> 01:21:44,310
I'm just curious if you think that 
that's going to start to be a.

1777
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:46,500
it's an off season.
I'm just going to get a new risk because

1778
01:21:46,501 --> 01:21:48,240
they can make better ones than genetics 
can.

1779
01:21:48,310 --> 01:21:51,610
We've talked about that with legs,
like what if they get to the point where

1780
01:21:51,611 --> 01:21:54,850
someone breaks a leg and it gets 
gangrene and have to move the leg,

1781
01:21:54,851 --> 01:21:57,340
but they were replaced with the bionic 
leg and it's like the $6,000,000

1782
01:21:57,341 --> 01:21:58,174
man.
What if they get you a leg that you can 

1783
01:21:59,561 --> 01:22:01,590
feel and it works way better than 
regular legs?

1784
01:22:01,620 --> 01:22:03,670
What would you rather do?
Would you rather be in a wheelchair?

1785
01:22:03,671 --> 01:22:04,504
Would you rather be on crutches or would
you rather have a leg that works way 

1786
01:22:06,911 --> 01:22:07,744
better than a regular leg?
What would you definitely take the 

1787
01:22:09,401 --> 01:22:10,840
fucking leg?
The bucks way better,

1788
01:22:10,841 --> 01:22:14,140
right?
So then if you feel it and it feels like

1789
01:22:14,141 --> 01:22:17,260
a regular leg,
what's to stop you from just deciding to

1790
01:22:17,261 --> 01:22:20,380
just do the other leg to get your arms 
done?

1791
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:22,780
What?
Let me get my neck done on it.

1792
01:22:23,340 --> 01:22:26,270
Why not ahead with fuck?
Carry around like that.

1793
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:29,530
For Real,
you just carry somebody around with you.

1794
01:22:29,550 --> 01:22:32,510
Send a text message or phone explodes.
I mean,

1795
01:22:32,511 --> 01:22:34,700
I feel like we might be moving towards 
this.

1796
01:22:34,701 --> 01:22:35,534
We now have this,
like where everyone's trying to be a 

1797
01:22:36,361 --> 01:22:37,194
super human super.
Everyone thinks they're a fucking 

1798
01:22:38,691 --> 01:22:39,380
athlete.

1799
01:22:39,380 --> 01:22:41,010
Well,
I met a guy who didn't have an arm.

1800
01:22:41,160 --> 01:22:43,650
He lost his arm.
I forget what the accident was,

1801
01:22:43,651 --> 01:22:48,110
but he had a carbon fiber arm with an 
articulating hand and it could move from

1802
01:22:48,450 --> 01:22:49,470
his thinking.
Well,

1803
01:22:49,471 --> 01:22:50,304
I don't think so.
I think he's moving it somehow or 

1804
01:22:51,841 --> 01:22:52,674
another with his nerves in his forearm.
I think somehow or another that's how 

1805
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:58,380
he's moving it.
But I'm not,

1806
01:22:58,730 --> 01:23:01,770
I'm not entirely sure.
The idea is that they've had,

1807
01:23:01,771 --> 01:23:03,710
um,
people that were there,

1808
01:23:03,711 --> 01:23:07,240
they put a,
these sort of electrodes or something to

1809
01:23:07,241 --> 01:23:08,074
their head and they can have them 
articulate fingers like people that are 

1810
01:23:11,591 --> 01:23:14,830
paralyzed these mechanical fingers.
But I've,

1811
01:23:14,831 --> 01:23:15,664
I've done this thing,
I went to this lab where they do these 

1812
01:23:18,431 --> 01:23:19,264
tests and we put this helmet on me.
And by thinking about things you can 

1813
01:23:22,241 --> 01:23:26,530
make a drone fly around by thinking 
about like when you're,

1814
01:23:26,710 --> 01:23:28,540
when you get,
achieve a certain frequency,

1815
01:23:28,930 --> 01:23:31,630
it communicates wirelessly with this 
drone,

1816
01:23:31,631 --> 01:23:34,120
through this thing that they put on your
head with all these electrodes.

1817
01:23:34,250 --> 01:23:35,083
We can actually,
I mean you were just talking about it 

1818
01:23:36,441 --> 01:23:38,840
with a Kennison.
We can kind of do that.

1819
01:23:39,110 --> 01:23:39,943
I mean he was doing that with words,
but I mean this is the shit that I do 

1820
01:23:41,931 --> 01:23:45,230
with horses is that you can kind of 
communicate with them,

1821
01:23:45,231 --> 01:23:46,064
with your lines if you're really having 
a 50 slash 50 consensual relationship 

1822
01:23:48,501 --> 01:23:51,440
with them because they're prey animals.
And you can literally just think if your

1823
01:23:51,441 --> 01:23:53,870
intention is pure enough.
I mean this sounds like bullshit,

1824
01:23:53,871 --> 01:23:54,920
the secret,
whatever.

1825
01:23:55,190 --> 01:23:56,023
But if you think about what you want 
from them and you're really present and 

1826
01:23:58,701 --> 01:24:00,350
connected to them,
they will do it.

1827
01:24:00,650 --> 01:24:02,460
Wow.
Unbelievable.

1828
01:24:02,470 --> 01:24:07,400
And it's like really into horse riding 
because they're prey animals,

1829
01:24:08,050 --> 01:24:09,830
their prey animals.
So the way that they've evolved,

1830
01:24:09,831 --> 01:24:10,664
if anyone cares that there's this book 
called Zen Mind Zen horse and talks 

1831
01:24:12,501 --> 01:24:13,970
about the evolution of the prey animal.

1832
01:24:13,970 --> 01:24:17,390
And basically how they can feel fear,
they can feel intention,

1833
01:24:17,391 --> 01:24:18,224
they can feel where you want to go and 
if you're training to be the lead mayor 

1834
01:24:21,111 --> 01:24:21,944
of the herd that they look to you and if
you basically anticipate something from 

1835
01:24:25,971 --> 01:24:28,220
them,
they will fulfill that anticipation.

1836
01:24:28,250 --> 01:24:29,990
It's wild.
So it's like we don't use bits,

1837
01:24:29,991 --> 01:24:30,824
we don't use saddles and I don't use any
sort of leads and I'll be on him and 

1838
01:24:34,041 --> 01:24:34,874
I'll lead a little bit with my knees,
but if I just visualize where I want to 

1839
01:24:36,711 --> 01:24:37,640
go,
he'll just go there.

1840
01:24:38,450 --> 01:24:39,283
But if I'm disconnected and,
and just came in from traffic and I'm 

1841
01:24:41,721 --> 01:24:43,640
just like bullshit,
like thinking about my shit.

1842
01:24:43,641 --> 01:24:45,710
He's just like not connected to me and 
we'll do anything.

1843
01:24:45,711 --> 01:24:48,200
It's hard to achieve.
You have to get to that flow.

1844
01:24:48,260 --> 01:24:49,093
Meditative state.
I haven't smoked weed and hung out with 

1845
01:24:53,030 --> 01:24:54,200
my horse before.

1846
01:24:54,230 --> 01:24:57,350
That's an interesting idea.
I've played music and stuff like that,

1847
01:24:57,890 --> 01:25:01,280
but maybe I should try that to trough my
amygdala.

1848
01:25:01,340 --> 01:25:02,420
Yeah,
just try a little.

1849
01:25:02,660 --> 01:25:04,210
Don't get crazy.
Just try a little bit.

1850
01:25:04,270 --> 01:25:05,103
That's actually a really good idea 
because when you bring anxiety around a 

1851
01:25:07,701 --> 01:25:10,460
prey animal,
they feel it and they just feel fear and

1852
01:25:10,461 --> 01:25:11,690
fear is,
you know what,

1853
01:25:11,700 --> 01:25:12,533
there have just been designed to avoid 
any sort of companion animal feels the 

1854
01:25:17,031 --> 01:25:18,950
same thing like dogs love.
No,

1855
01:25:18,951 --> 01:25:21,950
I think dogs knowing your high totally,
totally,

1856
01:25:23,330 --> 01:25:24,163
totally.
Because they get high with you and her 

1857
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:26,750
small.
They not.

1858
01:25:27,220 --> 01:25:29,300
Well,
I've had that happen before dog,

1859
01:25:29,310 --> 01:25:31,900
that she got a panic attack.
Oh No.

1860
01:25:32,270 --> 01:25:33,103
She fucking hit underneath the table.
I wish he was high as fuck as we hop 

1861
01:25:37,420 --> 01:25:39,360
boxed or me and joey ideas.
Oh Geez.

1862
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:44,570
My office we were doing in my office 
with my dog,

1863
01:25:44,571 --> 01:25:45,340
Lucy.

1864
01:25:45,340 --> 01:25:46,173
Um,
there's this guy that the dog that bit 

1865
01:25:47,361 --> 01:25:49,260
my year off,
I couldn't find him a home know.

1866
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:52,640
Basically if a dog,
a self soothes that way and it was taken

1867
01:25:52,641 --> 01:25:53,474
from his mother too young.
It's always going to sort of be a 

1868
01:25:54,471 --> 01:25:56,360
liability and I wasn't going to put them
down obviously.

1869
01:25:56,361 --> 01:25:57,194
So I sent him.
There's this guy named Stephen Baldwin 

1870
01:25:58,850 --> 01:26:01,490
and he takes dogs who've been people 
knowledge.

1871
01:26:01,491 --> 01:26:03,420
Alec Baldwin's brother.
Not like Alec Baldwin.

1872
01:26:04,750 --> 01:26:05,540
Oh,
there's a state.

1873
01:26:05,540 --> 01:26:07,160
Well he stephan s,
t e F,

1874
01:26:07,161 --> 01:26:07,994
f e n,
but Stephen Baldwin might also have a 

1875
01:26:10,011 --> 01:26:11,700
dog ranch.
In which case on Stephen Ball.

1876
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:13,970
I like to go there immediately.
There's a Stephen Baldwin.

1877
01:26:14,270 --> 01:26:16,160
Yeah,
there is senior moment.

1878
01:26:16,280 --> 01:26:18,110
Actor Stephen Baldwin,
right?

1879
01:26:18,350 --> 01:26:19,183
Your guys.
Stephen.

1880
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:20,153
Stephen,
yeah.

1881
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:22,110
I said Steven,
I hope got.

1882
01:26:22,170 --> 01:26:23,780
Probably fucked it up.
That's amazing.

1883
01:26:23,850 --> 01:26:26,000
And I've learned a lot today is to 
Stephen Baldwins.

1884
01:26:26,001 --> 01:26:28,710
There's two others.
Two hogs were handled on.

1885
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:31,880
Fuck me.
Fuck you one hour.

1886
01:26:31,910 --> 01:26:34,920
Kelly.
Mark Ruffalo forgot.

1887
01:26:35,150 --> 01:26:37,400
Here's the best,
newest hawks.

1888
01:26:37,401 --> 01:26:42,110
The best hopes and amazing actor.
He's pretty amazing because he uses hemp

1889
01:26:42,111 --> 01:26:43,910
treats for his dogs.
Good move.

1890
01:26:43,940 --> 01:26:46,700
Can you chill them out?
Chilling a little bit.

1891
01:26:46,701 --> 01:26:49,400
I think that's smart.
Need to pop one?

1892
01:26:49,580 --> 01:26:50,530
No,
I put A.

1893
01:26:50,540 --> 01:26:53,480
I've been trimming elk steaks and I have
these little scraps,

1894
01:26:53,690 --> 01:26:54,523
little scraps,
and give them to the doj the greatest 

1895
01:26:57,860 --> 01:27:00,250
training aid in the history of 
[inaudible].

1896
01:27:00,310 --> 01:27:01,340
Just give it to him.
Not Cooked,

1897
01:27:01,341 --> 01:27:02,061
right?
Yeah.

1898
01:27:02,061 --> 01:27:04,400
Raw.
You can give them one piece of less than

1899
01:27:04,401 --> 01:27:06,140
three days.
You have to feed him for three days.

1900
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:08,050
Three days,
yeah.

1901
01:27:08,050 --> 01:27:12,200
I have a friend who just gives the dog 
like a slab of raw meat every three days

1902
01:27:12,470 --> 01:27:15,680
and they don't feed them the second 
thing or animals way too much.

1903
01:27:15,681 --> 01:27:17,720
Dogs do not need to eat twice a day.

1904
01:27:17,720 --> 01:27:18,553
We give him this fucking giant bowl.
All of our dogs are overweight and 

1905
01:27:20,781 --> 01:27:22,780
overfed.
We're giving them.

1906
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:23,833
We're giving them way more food that 
they need and it's terrible on their 

1907
01:27:25,701 --> 01:27:26,534
joints and just terrible for them.
So I only feed my dogs as training 

1908
01:27:28,971 --> 01:27:30,220
rewards.
Wow.

1909
01:27:30,300 --> 01:27:31,400
Yeah.
They don't use training.

1910
01:27:31,401 --> 01:27:34,220
They don't get just a big bowl of food.
They get marrow bones,

1911
01:27:34,740 --> 01:27:36,860
they get meat,
they get eggs sometimes,

1912
01:27:36,861 --> 01:27:40,670
but they only get feeding throughout the
just running shit.

1913
01:27:40,671 --> 01:27:44,270
And your house.
You totally out for the fuck of how many

1914
01:27:44,271 --> 01:27:45,770
dogs do you have at your house?
I have three.

1915
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:46,833
Yeah.
So you gotta kind of be running shit 

1916
01:27:47,661 --> 01:27:49,640
because they're alone right now.
Just plot.

1917
01:27:49,680 --> 01:27:52,520
They're in.
Crates are almost always.

1918
01:27:52,521 --> 01:27:54,330
Dogs are den animals.
They want to be in credits.

1919
01:27:54,350 --> 01:27:56,060
People are always like,
it's mean to put them in crates.

1920
01:27:56,061 --> 01:27:56,720
No,
it's not.

1921
01:27:56,720 --> 01:27:57,553
They love it.
It's mean to just let them roam around 

1922
01:27:58,791 --> 01:27:59,624
all the time because then they get 
territorial and they think that they 

1923
01:28:00,831 --> 01:28:04,400
have to control things.
My dogs are guests in my home.

1924
01:28:04,940 --> 01:28:06,670
That's the whole deal.
Yeah.

1925
01:28:06,860 --> 01:28:08,690
They don't get on the couch.
They don't get to do anything.

1926
01:28:08,720 --> 01:28:13,430
That sounds like you're a slave master 
kind of sound like a species is to me,

1927
01:28:13,670 --> 01:28:14,503
kind of.
I mean I have had my ear ripped off so 

1928
01:28:15,981 --> 01:28:18,410
I've made some mistakes,
but with my dogs,

1929
01:28:18,890 --> 01:28:20,990
dogs really do well.
When you dominate them,

1930
01:28:21,020 --> 01:28:24,800
what kind of food do you feed them?
I feed them this place called the way in

1931
01:28:24,801 --> 01:28:27,500
this kitchen.
It's just keenwah and Turkey.

1932
01:28:27,501 --> 01:28:30,170
Keenwah and beef and chicken and they 
come in these frozen things.

1933
01:28:30,250 --> 01:28:33,110
Is it a good thing to give them grain?
Does it help them in some way?

1934
01:28:33,260 --> 01:28:33,650
I don't know.

1935
01:28:33,650 --> 01:28:37,490
They seem to do really well on it.
When I give them store bought food,

1936
01:28:37,491 --> 01:28:38,930
I sometimes do that.
Buffalo,

1937
01:28:38,931 --> 01:28:41,450
what's it called?
Buffalo wild buffalo or something,

1938
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:42,313
but they start eating grass and I see in
there they puke and I see in there 

1939
01:28:45,170 --> 01:28:47,870
because they eat grass.
Just sort of restore equilibrium because

1940
01:28:47,871 --> 01:28:48,704
they're too acidic.
So they'll start eating grass with that 

1941
01:28:50,281 --> 01:28:51,330
if that's where they do that.
Yeah.

1942
01:28:51,620 --> 01:28:54,830
So some sort of an instinct to restore.
Exactly.

1943
01:28:54,831 --> 01:28:57,620
They're not getting enough of certain 
minerals and vitamins.

1944
01:28:57,621 --> 01:28:58,454
They're not there.
It means they're malnourished and 

1945
01:28:59,421 --> 01:29:01,710
they're getting it elsewhere.
That's when they start eating dirt.

1946
01:29:01,711 --> 01:29:02,070
When they start

1947
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:03,480
eating shit,
they're malnourished.

1948
01:29:03,660 --> 01:29:04,620
So,
um,

1949
01:29:04,740 --> 01:29:06,840
I give them this stuff and they don't do
that.

1950
01:29:07,060 --> 01:29:07,893
Hmm.
So you got this from watching them just 

1951
01:29:11,241 --> 01:29:14,090
eat grass around the backyard like after
you played them?

1952
01:29:14,750 --> 01:29:16,600
Yeah.
The dogs puke up grass.

1953
01:29:16,601 --> 01:29:19,360
Are you seeing their poop?
That they have grass in it.

1954
01:29:19,361 --> 01:29:22,960
That means that they're having to go 
other places for nourishment.

1955
01:29:23,500 --> 01:29:24,333
So have you ever tried to feed them?
I know there's a lot of companies that 

1956
01:29:26,411 --> 01:29:28,630
sell,
like sort of a raw diet for dogs.

1957
01:29:28,631 --> 01:29:31,660
That's why I'm asking you this.
They have like these tubes of raw food

1958
01:29:32,810 --> 01:29:33,690
that I have,
that's,

1959
01:29:33,710 --> 01:29:36,290
I usually only do it for like training.
Um,

1960
01:29:36,310 --> 01:29:37,980
but that's what they're designed to eat.
I mean,

1961
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,150
they're designed to rob their walls,
you know,

1962
01:29:40,151 --> 01:29:41,140
they're just designed to eat raw meat.

1963
01:29:41,250 --> 01:29:42,330
This dark,
like,

1964
01:29:42,470 --> 01:29:44,700
like I said,
he's the sweetest dog of all time,

1965
01:29:44,850 --> 01:29:48,600
but he can barely keep it together when 
I have barely.

1966
01:29:48,601 --> 01:29:50,930
It's crazy like credit you get jumped up

1967
01:29:51,310 --> 01:29:52,143
because also the meat that we eat is 
full of antibiotics and chemicals has 

1968
01:29:54,731 --> 01:29:56,110
been frozen 50,000
times.

1969
01:29:56,111 --> 01:29:56,944
There's no fucking blood in it.
You're bringing home this fresh real 

1970
01:29:59,051 --> 01:30:01,510
meat with no garbage in it,
so he's like,

1971
01:30:01,900 --> 01:30:03,030
you're awakening his prime.

1972
01:30:03,210 --> 01:30:05,940
His reactions are incredible and his 
reactions are way.

1973
01:30:06,050 --> 01:30:07,660
They're just,
it's way more extreme.

1974
01:30:07,850 --> 01:30:12,850
Be Super Interested in juxtaposing,
like store bought meat and then your elk

1975
01:30:13,271 --> 01:30:15,080
meat and seeing what he goes.

1976
01:30:15,150 --> 01:30:17,720
I think dude,
either one of them for sure,

1977
01:30:17,780 --> 01:30:21,060
but I mean meat is meat.
I think to the dog.

1978
01:30:21,061 --> 01:30:21,894
I don't mean.
I bet if you gave him time and allowed 

1979
01:30:25,261 --> 01:30:28,170
him to discern and hunger was not an 
option.

1980
01:30:28,171 --> 01:30:29,004
Yeah.
If had already lean towards the elk 

1981
01:30:30,840 --> 01:30:33,930
towards the bloody stuff,
it's certainly more than that.

1982
01:30:33,931 --> 01:30:34,764
Toward then dog food.
If you put the elk down next to a bowl 

1983
01:30:37,261 --> 01:30:38,630
of dog food,
he would totally ignore the dog.

1984
01:30:39,080 --> 01:30:43,500
If you let the dog loose in to ride one 
bowl of elk in one bowl of dog food,

1985
01:30:43,680 --> 01:30:45,330
they would go to the elk 100 percent of 
the time.

1986
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:46,633
The ingredients in dog food,
it's like sugar or sucrose or high 

1987
01:30:50,841 --> 01:30:53,420
fructose corn syrup.
I mean it's just like trash.

1988
01:30:53,540 --> 01:30:56,320
I buy this stuff that has no grain in it
and it's all.

1989
01:30:56,330 --> 01:30:57,163
A lot of it is wild game.
A lot of his like lamb and beef and 

1990
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:03,470
people talk about their dogs sitting 
cancer at five.

1991
01:31:04,460 --> 01:31:05,840
Feeding your dog.
Well,

1992
01:31:05,841 --> 01:31:07,640
it's also could be like a genetic thing,
right?

1993
01:31:07,730 --> 01:31:08,563
Couldn't it be fucked up breed.
But I feel like if I think dogs are 

1994
01:31:12,261 --> 01:31:14,100
supposed to eat meat,
I would.

1995
01:31:14,270 --> 01:31:16,910
I would think that like if you could 
figure out a way like I've been thinking

1996
01:31:16,911 --> 01:31:19,160
about that lately,
like actually hunting for my dog,

1997
01:31:19,700 --> 01:31:20,533
like getting a,
like some food and putting aside just 

1998
01:31:23,571 --> 01:31:25,460
for the dogs do that.
I always do,

1999
01:31:25,461 --> 01:31:27,320
whenever I make eggs,
I'll make some for the dogs.

2000
01:31:27,530 --> 01:31:28,580
Yeah,
just grind it up,

2001
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:32,290
like make a and just see if they behave 
different.

2002
01:31:32,291 --> 01:31:33,100
If they feel there.

2003
01:31:33,100 --> 01:31:33,933
Yeah,
sometimes I'll just feed them meat and 

2004
01:31:35,921 --> 01:31:38,570
then eggs and then a couple days later 
I'll just give a.

2005
01:31:38,840 --> 01:31:40,510
sometimes I'll just give the marrow 
bones for the day.

2006
01:31:40,890 --> 01:31:41,723
What's the thinking of is like,
that's like some of the only mass 

2007
01:31:44,191 --> 01:31:46,500
produced factory farm food that I still 
buy.

2008
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:48,380
I mean it's.
Yeah,

2009
01:31:48,381 --> 01:31:49,214
it's got to be factory farmed.
I mean they're getting it the cheapest 

2010
01:31:51,541 --> 01:31:52,590
way they get it.
Right.

2011
01:31:52,650 --> 01:31:54,290
If you're buying some sort of dried 
chicken

2012
01:31:54,490 --> 01:31:56,980
feeding your kids lucky charms,
you know?

2013
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:58,180
Yeah.
Just because the dog's meet.

2014
01:31:59,530 --> 01:32:01,270
Yeah.
And then they sleep more,

2015
01:32:01,330 --> 01:32:04,700
you know,
it's just probably fart more.

2016
01:32:05,550 --> 01:32:07,180
Yeah.
Does he fired a lot?

2017
01:32:07,300 --> 01:32:09,100
Sometimes it's not a lot,
but when he.

2018
01:32:09,101 --> 01:32:09,934
Does that seem like actually having them
eat meat and see if he farts less 

2019
01:32:13,090 --> 01:32:13,923
because their bodies are working so hard
to break it down and they have to 

2020
01:32:16,060 --> 01:32:16,893
methane gas.
There could really be what it is that 

2021
01:32:18,731 --> 01:32:20,350
when your dogs are fighting,
that means something's up.

2022
01:32:20,351 --> 01:32:22,840
It's like when you're fighting a lot.
So it's like one of my wanting to eat.

2023
01:32:22,870 --> 01:32:23,703
Yeah.
What's going on?

2024
01:32:24,010 --> 01:32:26,380
Why is my body working so hard to break 
this down?

2025
01:32:26,381 --> 01:32:27,490
Why isn't this digestible?

2026
01:32:28,050 --> 01:32:29,400
Do you follow any kind of crazy diet?

2027
01:32:30,250 --> 01:32:32,530
You know,
I had eating disorders,

2028
01:32:32,710 --> 01:32:36,070
shocker plot twist.
I mean obviously.

2029
01:32:36,590 --> 01:32:38,980
Um,
so I have to be careful with that shit.

2030
01:32:39,010 --> 01:32:40,960
How'd you get over him?
You know,

2031
01:32:41,050 --> 01:32:42,640
a lot of things.
Um,

2032
01:32:43,270 --> 01:32:47,290
I like want to do a 12 step program for 
codependence,

2033
01:32:47,450 --> 01:32:48,370
you know,
which,

2034
01:32:48,430 --> 01:32:49,263
and I did this like inner child work.
It all sounds like very hippie and like 

2035
01:32:52,091 --> 01:32:52,924
ridiculous.
But I had to start re parenting myself 

2036
01:32:56,051 --> 01:32:58,210
because I grew up around eating 
disorders.

2037
01:32:58,211 --> 01:32:59,044
I saw a lot of it.
There wasn't a lot of eating in my 

2038
01:33:00,251 --> 01:33:01,570
house,
there was a lot of eating on the go,

2039
01:33:01,571 --> 01:33:02,404
there was nothing in my fridge,
like it just never occurred to me to 

2040
01:33:03,971 --> 01:33:04,804
take care of myself nutritionally.
But eating disorders are a lot about 

2041
01:33:07,361 --> 01:33:09,640
control for the most part.
I'm sure you know that.

2042
01:33:09,970 --> 01:33:10,803
So it was like my life felt out of 
control when I was a teenager and that 

2043
01:33:13,961 --> 01:33:14,794
was the one thing I could control is 
what I aid getting thin also got me 

2044
01:33:16,871 --> 01:33:18,730
attention.
It got people to like worry about me and

2045
01:33:18,731 --> 01:33:19,564
font over me and that I wanted attention
and I think that coupled with like 

2046
01:33:24,220 --> 01:33:28,720
intense therapy with it and then doing a
job where I get

2047
01:33:29,070 --> 01:33:30,180
my sort of

2048
01:33:30,890 --> 01:33:34,940
quota of attention in healthy ways that 
box is checked.

2049
01:33:34,941 --> 01:33:36,920
I no longer need to get attention and 
unhealthy ways.

2050
01:33:37,310 --> 01:33:38,143
Does that make sense?

2051
01:33:38,230 --> 01:33:39,063
So it was basically an attention thing 
and also just a bad programming saying 

2052
01:33:42,190 --> 01:33:45,220
bad conditioning had both of those 
things sort of.

2053
01:33:45,730 --> 01:33:46,420
Yes.

2054
01:33:46,420 --> 01:33:51,420
And I had an adversarial relationship 
with my body and with food and um,

2055
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:54,530
it was a very antisocial behavior as 
well.

2056
01:33:54,580 --> 01:33:58,480
Liked I was able to isolate,
like I in school was not very social.

2057
01:33:58,481 --> 01:34:01,450
I have a socially awkward,
I was really scared of people and having

2058
01:34:01,451 --> 01:34:03,420
like fucked up eating.
Like you're eating in your car,

2059
01:34:03,430 --> 01:34:04,031
you're high,
you know,

2060
01:34:04,031 --> 01:34:05,440
you can't really go to dinner with 
people.

2061
01:34:05,441 --> 01:34:08,710
It's kind of a way that I put a wall up 
between myself and other people as well.

2062
01:34:09,420 --> 01:34:14,420
Why does a more common a female thing 
like from your perspective,

2063
01:34:14,431 --> 01:34:17,030
like when you think about like people 
having like that,

2064
01:34:17,100 --> 01:34:17,933
that phrase,
having an adversarial relationship with 

2065
01:34:19,921 --> 01:34:21,930
your body.
You don't really hear guys say that

2066
01:34:22,160 --> 01:34:25,790
because we have an expiration date and 
you guys kind of don't maybe.

2067
01:34:25,791 --> 01:34:28,540
And then we also have this sort of,
um,

2068
01:34:28,970 --> 01:34:30,090
what is it?
Golden rule,

2069
01:34:30,140 --> 01:34:33,950
symmetrical need to look fertile to you 
guys where it's like tiny ways,

2070
01:34:33,960 --> 01:34:35,330
tiny legs,
big hips,

2071
01:34:35,331 --> 01:34:36,141
big boom,
you know,

2072
01:34:36,141 --> 01:34:36,974
like I think there's just a lot more 
pressure on our bodies because our 

2073
01:34:39,051 --> 01:34:43,280
bodies are why you guys decided to 
protect us and procreate with us or not,

2074
01:34:43,300 --> 01:34:44,750
you know?
And then there were of course the social

2075
01:34:44,751 --> 01:34:46,160
construction of what's beautiful,
like,

2076
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:47,450
you know,
eating disorders.

2077
01:34:47,451 --> 01:34:49,430
I read this amazing book,
I can't remember the name of it,

2078
01:34:49,431 --> 01:34:50,264
but how they're eating disorders in 
Italy only started when American 

2079
01:34:54,561 --> 01:34:55,394
television went over there.
And it's like tearing the fabric of 

2080
01:34:57,771 --> 01:34:58,604
their families because food is how they 
show love and connect with each other 

2081
01:35:00,921 --> 01:35:02,030
and mothers,
you know,

2082
01:35:02,031 --> 01:35:02,480
make,
you know,

2083
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:04,820
it starts with breastfeeding and then 
it's feeding you pasta.

2084
01:35:04,821 --> 01:35:05,654
And this and girls stopped eating pasta 
and dairy because they started getting 

2085
01:35:08,451 --> 01:35:11,410
eating disorders and it was like tearing
apart the fabric of Italian families.

2086
01:35:11,560 --> 01:35:13,000
Wow.
Amazing

2087
01:35:13,100 --> 01:35:15,920
to think about.
But I definitely grew up around a lot of

2088
01:35:15,921 --> 01:35:17,480
it.
I saw women,

2089
01:35:17,510 --> 01:35:18,343
you know,
I think that we all have such a fucked 

2090
01:35:20,031 --> 01:35:21,590
up relationship with,
you know,

2091
01:35:22,040 --> 01:35:24,710
our children because we tell our kids to
do certain things,

2092
01:35:24,711 --> 01:35:25,544
but we don't do those things.
So I heard adults say it like I need to 

2093
01:35:28,011 --> 01:35:29,690
lose weight,
I need to lose five pounds.

2094
01:35:29,691 --> 01:35:33,290
Adults who were not fat.
And so I internalized sort of,

2095
01:35:33,291 --> 01:35:34,840
oh,
that's the body that I need minus,

2096
01:35:34,970 --> 01:35:36,800
you know,
like I just saw a lot of fucked up shit.

2097
01:35:37,100 --> 01:35:37,933
Um,
and women that had adverse ational 

2098
01:35:38,881 --> 01:35:40,460
really adversarial relation with the 
body.

2099
01:35:40,461 --> 01:35:42,080
So I just like,
I didn't know any better,

2100
01:35:42,290 --> 01:35:43,940
but it seems like a lot of women have 
it.

2101
01:35:43,941 --> 01:35:45,260
Like from the jump,
right?

2102
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:46,153
I mean,
it's not something that I don't even 

2103
01:35:47,361 --> 01:35:50,900
know if you're really aware of your 
expiration date when you're 16 and 17,

2104
01:35:50,901 --> 01:35:52,910
are you think you're not thinking about 
your longevity,

2105
01:35:52,911 --> 01:35:54,860
right?
You think about your current state.

2106
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:56,230
Yeah.
Women are objectified.

2107
01:35:56,231 --> 01:35:57,460
It's such a young age.
You know,

2108
01:35:57,461 --> 01:35:58,294
my brother is so good.
He's got these daughters and they're 

2109
01:36:00,461 --> 01:36:02,230
gorgeous and he always tells people 
don't tell them.

2110
01:36:02,231 --> 01:36:03,064
They're pretty.
Tell them they're smart at such a young 

2111
01:36:04,511 --> 01:36:05,231
age.
You're told like,

2112
01:36:05,231 --> 01:36:06,640
you're so beautiful.
You're so pretty.

2113
01:36:06,641 --> 01:36:07,330
Did it.
Ah.

2114
01:36:07,330 --> 01:36:08,890
And whereas boys,
they're like,

2115
01:36:08,891 --> 01:36:10,330
you're so cool.
You're so awesome.

2116
01:36:10,331 --> 01:36:13,300
You're so good at football or whatever.
So I think from such an early age,

2117
01:36:13,301 --> 01:36:14,134
I thought my appearance was the only 
thing that I had to offer the world and 

2118
01:36:16,031 --> 01:36:16,864
I just got really obsessed and 
fastidious about like what it looked 

2119
01:36:19,241 --> 01:36:22,540
like and I just thought I had to be 
really skinny at a young age.

2120
01:36:23,370 --> 01:36:25,260
How do you talk to kids like that in 
that regards?

2121
01:36:25,261 --> 01:36:27,180
Very important.
Like instead of saying,

2122
01:36:27,181 --> 01:36:29,460
you're so good at that,
you're supposed to say,

2123
01:36:29,461 --> 01:36:33,000
see how working hard has paid off this 
way.

2124
01:36:33,780 --> 01:36:34,860
Yeah,
I suppose to say,

2125
01:36:34,861 --> 01:36:35,694
look,
all the times you've gone to class now 

2126
01:36:36,991 --> 01:36:38,550
you can do this.
This is amazing.

2127
01:36:38,970 --> 01:36:39,900
You've progressed.

2128
01:36:40,190 --> 01:36:43,730
Also heard.
It's really good because I had struggled

2129
01:36:43,731 --> 01:36:46,990
with intense perfectionism in eating 
disorders are a big part of that because

2130
01:36:47,030 --> 01:36:47,863
I didn't know I was allowed to have 
flaws as a kid because my parents I 

2131
01:36:50,151 --> 01:36:53,900
think always tried to put on a front 
that everything was fine when it wasn't.

2132
01:36:54,140 --> 01:36:54,973
Whereas what they say you're supposed to
do with kids as fuck up and then course 

2133
01:36:57,591 --> 01:36:59,360
correct,
and then they get to see resilience.

2134
01:36:59,361 --> 01:37:00,830
So you go,
hey,

2135
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:03,140
I was late to pick you up from school 
today.

2136
01:37:03,141 --> 01:37:05,510
I totally miscalculated the time.
I'm really sorry.

2137
01:37:05,511 --> 01:37:06,231
Instead of being like,
oh,

2138
01:37:06,231 --> 01:37:08,240
there was a line at the bank and things.
Or just,

2139
01:37:08,241 --> 01:37:09,800
you know,
like you don't lie to kids.

2140
01:37:09,801 --> 01:37:10,634
You weren't supposed to pretend things 
are fine or you're not supposed to 

2141
01:37:11,691 --> 01:37:14,510
pretend you're perfect to be this hero 
to them.

2142
01:37:14,870 --> 01:37:17,150
Or if like you're fighting with your 
spouse,

2143
01:37:17,151 --> 01:37:17,811
you go like,
hey,

2144
01:37:17,811 --> 01:37:20,240
we kind of got in an argument and I was 
wrong and now we're fine.

2145
01:37:20,241 --> 01:37:20,871
You don't say like,
no,

2146
01:37:20,871 --> 01:37:23,090
everything's fine.
We were just watching a movie.

2147
01:37:23,091 --> 01:37:24,410
It was the sound from the TV,
you know,

2148
01:37:24,411 --> 01:37:25,580
you don't lie to them.
Right,

2149
01:37:25,581 --> 01:37:25,971
right,
right.

2150
01:37:25,971 --> 01:37:26,804
And I never had any of that.
I just got the message very young and 

2151
01:37:28,200 --> 01:37:31,700
like I had to be perfect and then.
And that's the way of traffic.

2152
01:37:31,900 --> 01:37:34,490
See that's very rare that boys get the 
thin message.

2153
01:37:34,491 --> 01:37:37,160
Just what I'm trying to get to it.
It's like it's odd that it hits

2154
01:37:37,550 --> 01:37:40,280
just the opposite.
You have to be muscular and strong.

2155
01:37:40,310 --> 01:37:41,143
I mean,
I recently just learned that men like 

2156
01:37:42,421 --> 01:37:44,690
have body image stuff.
I just had no idea,

2157
01:37:44,691 --> 01:37:46,490
but it just manifests in different ways.
Right.

2158
01:37:46,491 --> 01:37:48,680
It's like you guys have to be like cut.
You have to be big.

2159
01:37:48,681 --> 01:37:50,060
You have to be,
you know,

2160
01:37:50,270 --> 01:37:52,560
have a big Dick.
Like you guys have all that Shit Shit.

2161
01:37:52,840 --> 01:37:54,170
Yeah.
Some men do have the,

2162
01:37:54,250 --> 01:37:56,070
the fat,
like where

2163
01:37:56,070 --> 01:37:58,110
it really bothers him.
Really books their heads,

2164
01:37:58,120 --> 01:37:59,460
they're eating salads all over the 
place.

2165
01:37:59,820 --> 01:38:02,400
There's a lot anorexic,
no question about it.

2166
01:38:02,401 --> 01:38:03,234
I mean it just.
Especially when you're trying to course 

2167
01:38:05,041 --> 01:38:05,960
correct,
you know,

2168
01:38:05,970 --> 01:38:07,170
like you've got,
you decide,

2169
01:38:07,171 --> 01:38:08,280
okay,
I'm going the other way.

2170
01:38:08,281 --> 01:38:10,230
I'm going to fucking like,
you look at yourself in the mirror,

2171
01:38:10,231 --> 01:38:11,070
you get disgusted,
you know,

2172
01:38:11,071 --> 01:38:15,300
like I'm not eating.
I see a lot of guys and I'm curious your

2173
01:38:15,301 --> 01:38:16,134
take on this because you're such a big 
part of this world of like these guys 

2174
01:38:18,541 --> 01:38:20,060
who are like,
I'm Paleo,

2175
01:38:20,480 --> 01:38:21,540
don't eat anything,
and I'm like,

2176
01:38:22,090 --> 01:38:22,923
this is still fucking rigid and fucked 
up and I see guys with their cricket 

2177
01:38:25,741 --> 01:38:30,300
protein.
I dated a guy who just ate dry protein.

2178
01:38:30,301 --> 01:38:32,100
I'm like,
this is a fucking eating disorder.

2179
01:38:32,110 --> 01:38:34,800
You know,
like when is it healthy?

2180
01:38:34,801 --> 01:38:37,350
When does it go into disorder than 
dysfunctional.

2181
01:38:37,800 --> 01:38:41,280
It's unnecessary based on the results 
that you get from it,

2182
01:38:41,340 --> 01:38:42,173
right?
It's like,

2183
01:38:42,360 --> 01:38:43,193
okay,
if you just eat healthy foods and you 

2184
01:38:44,971 --> 01:38:45,804
take like say.
I mean depending upon how much training 

2185
01:38:47,911 --> 01:38:48,744
you're doing,
you might want to take a protein 

2186
01:38:50,401 --> 01:38:51,234
supplement.
Occasionally you get to take something 

2187
01:38:52,411 --> 01:38:56,040
that's easily digestible,
concentrate on macronutrients,

2188
01:38:56,070 --> 01:38:57,900
concentrating on getting most of it from
your food,

2189
01:38:57,901 --> 01:39:00,390
but making sure you balance things out 
with supplements.

2190
01:39:00,750 --> 01:39:01,583
Once you do all that,
like why are you eating dry protein 

2191
01:39:03,270 --> 01:39:06,120
dude,
just eat some food,

2192
01:39:06,121 --> 01:39:06,954
get a nice piece of salmon and the salad
and it's going to be way better for you 

2193
01:39:10,021 --> 01:39:11,850
than what you're eating.
If it's irrational.

2194
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,790
I used to have such an irrational fear 
of fat,

2195
01:39:15,210 --> 01:39:18,000
like I would go to a restaurant order 
steamed vegetables.

2196
01:39:18,030 --> 01:39:20,460
If there was oil on it,
I would like pat it down.

2197
01:39:20,490 --> 01:39:21,870
Like it was like insanity.

2198
01:39:22,120 --> 01:39:22,920
It was.
But,

2199
01:39:22,920 --> 01:39:25,650
but eating disorders are not logical 
completely.

2200
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:26,753
They become more like a mirage.
Like I used to only eat like dried 

2201
01:39:29,431 --> 01:39:30,264
fruit,
which is so fucking bad for you and 

2202
01:39:32,101 --> 01:39:34,560
fattening.
It's pure sugar,

2203
01:39:34,870 --> 01:39:36,300
you know?
It's not logical.

2204
01:39:36,860 --> 01:39:37,693
So good.
Yes,

2205
01:39:37,770 --> 01:39:39,440
but then it would like go to the gym for
four hours.

2206
01:39:39,450 --> 01:39:41,640
It's like I wasn't even good at having 
an eating disorder.

2207
01:39:41,641 --> 01:39:42,620
I like,
you're not even eat.

2208
01:39:42,680 --> 01:39:44,620
I was eating 4,000
calories a day.

2209
01:39:44,621 --> 01:39:45,870
It's like,
what?

2210
01:39:45,900 --> 01:39:48,750
You're not even good at being anorexic,
so it's like I just,

2211
01:39:48,751 --> 01:39:49,584
it becomes so irrational and you just 
get so a logical and you just have so 

2212
01:39:53,551 --> 01:39:54,384
many blind spots about,
but don't you think you just know a 

2213
01:39:55,861 --> 01:39:59,970
whole lot more about nutrition now too 
because like when this is going on,

2214
01:39:59,971 --> 01:40:02,880
like say say,
say back to like 20 years ago,

2215
01:40:03,180 --> 01:40:05,730
how many people really knew how to eat 
correctly.

2216
01:40:06,060 --> 01:40:10,310
Everybody was eating whole grain bread 
and they thought that was the way to go.

2217
01:40:10,311 --> 01:40:11,144
Everything there wasn't this like high 
fructose corn syrup and fucking 

2218
01:40:15,080 --> 01:40:17,790
everything and like antibiotics and 
garbage and everything.

2219
01:40:17,820 --> 01:40:18,653
We didn't notice there was that,
but we didn't understand like what your 

2220
01:40:23,431 --> 01:40:24,264
body actually needed.
We were trying to go low fat with 

2221
01:40:25,831 --> 01:40:28,950
everything like everybody was trying to 
go with low fat yogurt.

2222
01:40:29,880 --> 01:40:32,370
Low fat milk has sugar in it.
It's disgusting.

2223
01:40:32,460 --> 01:40:35,240
Low fat milk has sugar in it.
Put sugar in it because otherwise,

2224
01:40:36,670 --> 01:40:41,670
yeah.
There's also this rat king's rat kings.

2225
01:40:43,950 --> 01:40:44,783
Kings are now saying,
I saw a photo of a bunch of dead ones 

2226
01:40:48,151 --> 01:40:51,180
all tangled together by the tail and 
they just starve to death.

2227
01:40:51,510 --> 01:40:52,950
Well,
is that what a rat king is?

2228
01:40:52,980 --> 01:40:54,030
A rat king is when

2229
01:40:54,030 --> 01:40:55,290
they're.
They all get tangled together.

2230
01:40:55,360 --> 01:40:56,193
Retails get tangled and then they shared
in an all congeals and they just turned 

2231
01:40:59,111 --> 01:41:01,780
into a mass of rats and then they starve
to death and die.

2232
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:02,673
Oh,
Jesus.

2233
01:41:02,810 --> 01:41:04,810
No.
How do they get all tangled up?

2234
01:41:04,811 --> 01:41:06,040
Like,
I don't know.

2235
01:41:06,041 --> 01:41:07,410
It doesn't make a lot of sense.
All.

2236
01:41:07,740 --> 01:41:08,320
I mean they are

2237
01:41:08,320 --> 01:41:10,640
pretty.
But Sinewy.

2238
01:41:10,670 --> 01:41:13,710
I've never seen this before.
Jamie King?

2239
01:41:13,770 --> 01:41:14,690
Yeah,
there it is right there.

2240
01:41:14,691 --> 01:41:15,570
So that's one way.

2241
01:41:15,730 --> 01:41:19,610
Tails on your it out or they get stuck 
together,

2242
01:41:19,611 --> 01:41:20,930
aren't they?
Like kind of slimy.

2243
01:41:21,260 --> 01:41:25,970
Guess if I had a gas that they spend too
much time in a very small area,

2244
01:41:27,440 --> 01:41:28,273
I would imagine.

2245
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:29,833
Scroll King.
Those squirrels got accidentally 

2246
01:41:31,991 --> 01:41:32,824
intertwined.

2247
01:41:32,910 --> 01:41:33,990
No,
no.

2248
01:41:33,991 --> 01:41:35,690
That's heartbreaking.
What are they going to do?

2249
01:41:36,130 --> 01:41:38,740
Don't get eaten by coyotes.
Fox Goes,

2250
01:41:39,180 --> 01:41:40,860
hold on,
but that bother you.

2251
01:41:41,040 --> 01:41:42,430
This predation bother you.

2252
01:41:43,530 --> 01:41:45,510
Like you love animals,
but I do love animals.

2253
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:47,520
Here's what I'll say.
Your deal,

2254
01:41:47,521 --> 01:41:52,521
because you do it from an angle of like 
conservation is I think is amazing.

2255
01:41:53,010 --> 01:41:54,470
Well,
I sort of do it for,

2256
01:41:54,540 --> 01:41:56,990
from an angle of conservation,
well,

2257
01:41:57,120 --> 01:42:00,240
but you have more food,
mostly foods number one,

2258
01:42:00,241 --> 01:42:04,440
but conservation is a consequence of 
trying to seek out food that way because

2259
01:42:04,441 --> 01:42:05,274
the money that's spent goes directly to 
try to preserve the habitat where these 

2260
01:42:08,581 --> 01:42:09,414
animals live and to keep things public 
to keep all this land like we have 

2261
01:42:12,691 --> 01:42:14,040
millions of acres of land

2262
01:42:14,140 --> 01:42:14,973
public.
Yeah.

2263
01:42:15,340 --> 01:42:16,173
I know that we need predators in order 
to look for things to make sense like 

2264
01:42:19,210 --> 01:42:19,960
that.
Why,

2265
01:42:19,960 --> 01:42:20,793
you know,
wolves being reintroduced into 

2266
01:42:21,611 --> 01:42:23,410
yellowstone basically everyone,
you know,

2267
01:42:23,411 --> 01:42:26,860
like you call out a couple and more 
people more get to live,

2268
01:42:26,890 --> 01:42:27,850
right.
Not People.

2269
01:42:28,090 --> 01:42:29,950
Um,
but I'm sort of obsessed with that.

2270
01:42:29,951 --> 01:42:31,660
And also,
I mean just understanding that like kind

2271
01:42:31,661 --> 01:42:34,720
of such a big key to,
you know,

2272
01:42:34,930 --> 01:42:35,763
whatever as this sounds ridiculous,
but I don't know why I have shame about 

2273
01:42:37,791 --> 01:42:39,160
like giving a shit about the 
environment.

2274
01:42:39,430 --> 01:42:40,263
Um,
I don't know when being into the 

2275
01:42:41,500 --> 01:42:44,740
environment became like,
I mean that's quite lame,

2276
01:42:44,741 --> 01:42:49,741
but it's like I think it's 240,000
gallons of water for one cow and we only

2277
01:42:50,591 --> 01:42:52,990
eat 40 percent of cows,
normally,

2278
01:42:53,290 --> 01:42:54,123
50 percent of its body,
percent of his body if we are so 

2279
01:42:55,991 --> 01:42:56,824
wasteful and the way that you do it,
which is like you're eating every part 

2280
01:42:59,411 --> 01:43:01,720
of the body and don't you eat it for 
like months at a time and stuff.

2281
01:43:02,260 --> 01:43:04,000
I think what you're doing for the 
environment is amazing.

2282
01:43:04,370 --> 01:43:05,203
Well,
I think that's a consequence of just 

2283
01:43:07,250 --> 01:43:10,040
being selfish and selfish.
Not in a bad way,

2284
01:43:10,041 --> 01:43:10,874
but so,
I mean the honest word is selfish 

2285
01:43:11,931 --> 01:43:16,430
because my feelings about meat where I 
really enjoyed eating meat and I,

2286
01:43:16,580 --> 01:43:17,413
I was thinking like,
well let me look at it from a health 

2287
01:43:19,131 --> 01:43:20,510
perspective.
And boy,

2288
01:43:20,511 --> 01:43:23,630
if you look at it objectively,
there's a lot of shit that vegans try to

2289
01:43:23,631 --> 01:43:25,310
point out.
But if you look at it objectively,

2290
01:43:25,311 --> 01:43:26,144
there's almost nothing that shows that 
eating meat with vegetables is bad for 

2291
01:43:29,331 --> 01:43:29,880
you.

2292
01:43:29,880 --> 01:43:31,440
Well,
they do these different speeds.

2293
01:43:31,441 --> 01:43:32,274
Is that true?

2294
01:43:33,330 --> 01:43:35,260
What does,
what actually matters to me?

2295
01:43:35,290 --> 01:43:36,030
What?
This mic.

2296
01:43:36,030 --> 01:43:37,380
I'm sorry.
Why am I doing this?

2297
01:43:38,550 --> 01:43:42,090
What's wrong with me?
I'm rusty on my podcast.

2298
01:43:42,450 --> 01:43:44,370
I know because I'm actually trying to 
talk to you.

2299
01:43:44,371 --> 01:43:46,620
I keep forgetting we're on a job.
It just gets weird,

2300
01:43:46,650 --> 01:43:48,900
but is it.
I mean because our teeth are sharp.

2301
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:50,820
This is proof.
We're designed to be predators.

2302
01:43:50,960 --> 01:43:52,040
I were more

2303
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:52,873
omnivores.
We're not predators because if we're a 

2304
01:43:54,511 --> 01:43:55,344
predator,
if we were capable of did this like the 

2305
01:43:56,001 --> 01:43:56,834
argument against us being predators by 
like really like argumentative vegans 

2306
01:44:00,411 --> 01:44:03,280
who they give these speeches about.
If we were really predators,

2307
01:44:03,290 --> 01:44:05,630
we would have fangs.
We'd be able to eat things raw.

2308
01:44:05,870 --> 01:44:07,910
You know,
we are just opportunists.

2309
01:44:08,350 --> 01:44:09,183
We are heatedness and we don't need to 
live like this and they argued that 

2310
01:44:11,271 --> 01:44:14,270
because our intestines are longer,
but here the arguments not good.

2311
01:44:14,271 --> 01:44:15,104
Here's why it's not good.
We evolve to kill animals and cook them 

2312
01:44:17,691 --> 01:44:18,524
and then chew them up and eat them.
We've been doing that for thousands of 

2313
01:44:21,290 --> 01:44:22,123
years.
That's why we looked this way and we 

2314
01:44:22,701 --> 01:44:25,790
don't look like chimps,
chimps,

2315
01:44:25,940 --> 01:44:26,840
chimps,
they,

2316
01:44:27,230 --> 01:44:29,180
they,
they cannibalize chimps.

2317
01:44:29,181 --> 01:44:32,390
Eat monkeys or chimps.
Eat a lot of monkeys.

2318
01:44:32,450 --> 01:44:33,830
Jesus,
a lot of monkeys,

2319
01:44:34,070 --> 01:44:35,900
one of their favorite.
They eat them alive.

2320
01:44:36,080 --> 01:44:39,230
They tear them apart.
Is must much video of chimps,

2321
01:44:39,350 --> 01:44:42,620
particularly in the Congo,
grabbing monkeys out of trees and eating

2322
01:44:42,621 --> 01:44:45,230
them along.
Just tearing them apart with their hands

2323
01:44:45,510 --> 01:44:46,280
champs.
What?

2324
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:47,180
Rip.
That guy's face off.

2325
01:44:47,220 --> 01:44:49,910
Yes.
Chimps are the closest to us.

2326
01:44:49,911 --> 01:44:51,020
Of course.
They're super humid.

2327
01:44:51,021 --> 01:44:51,771
Yeah,
they're so.

2328
01:44:51,771 --> 01:44:52,604
They're so close to what we are there,
like one step left or right of the 

2329
01:44:55,851 --> 01:44:56,684
evolutionary chain.
Something like 90 to 99 percent of our 

2330
01:45:01,251 --> 01:45:02,960
DNA.
Insanely strong,

2331
01:45:03,140 --> 01:45:05,810
insanely strong.
Like we can't even rationalize.

2332
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:07,790
Smaller than gorillas,
way smaller,

2333
01:45:07,791 --> 01:45:08,624
but as strong as a 500 pound man,
like a 150 pound chimpanzees like 

2334
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:13,393
literally like bigger than a game of 
thrones guy just rip you apart like you 

2335
01:45:18,501 --> 01:45:19,334
don't.
You'll never be able to understand the 

2336
01:45:20,091 --> 01:45:22,040
amount of power they can generate with 
their limbs.

2337
01:45:22,070 --> 01:45:25,300
My concern is more where does it meet 
Greg?

2338
01:45:25,301 --> 01:45:27,140
Right?
But the way that we eat meat is actually

2339
01:45:27,141 --> 01:45:29,630
killing us in the longterm and 
destroying our planet.

2340
01:45:29,630 --> 01:45:34,630
So much that we're just going to fucking
go extinct if we don't just do it in the

2341
01:45:34,721 --> 01:45:35,800
kind of way that you do it.
Yeah.

2342
01:45:35,810 --> 01:45:36,980
There's some chimps,
right?

2343
01:45:36,981 --> 01:45:40,280
They're tearing apart a monkey.
See the little hands.

2344
01:45:40,310 --> 01:45:42,630
Holy Fuck.
Why does that look like a gorilla to me?

2345
01:45:42,690 --> 01:45:44,870
Now that's a chimp.
That's a straight up chimp.

2346
01:45:44,930 --> 01:45:48,620
That's a big ass fucking tearing that 
monkey apart.

2347
01:45:49,550 --> 01:45:50,383
I had no idea that they meet.
Their favorite thing was the thing they 

2348
01:45:54,651 --> 01:45:58,610
love more than anything.
It's just hard to get a monkey when they

2349
01:45:58,611 --> 01:46:00,680
get a monkey.
They don't give a fuck about a banana.

2350
01:46:01,040 --> 01:46:03,590
So what's it resumed?
Chimps and gorillas?

2351
01:46:03,620 --> 01:46:06,590
Gorillas are vegetarians.
We're 100 percent vegetarian.

2352
01:46:06,910 --> 01:46:07,760
Yeah.
Yep.

2353
01:46:08,090 --> 01:46:10,100
Huge.
The biggest primates we know of,

2354
01:46:10,520 --> 01:46:13,340
they have these giant fangs and that's 
just for war,

2355
01:46:13,450 --> 01:46:14,283
you know,
that's just one gorilla takes care of 

2356
01:46:15,411 --> 01:46:16,280
like,
you know,

2357
01:46:16,340 --> 01:46:17,173
a gang of bitches and grill has tiny 
little Dick Taylor because penis sizes 

2358
01:46:23,241 --> 01:46:24,074
and testicle size is directly 
proportionate to the amount of 

2359
01:46:25,851 --> 01:46:28,190
promiscuous females in the area.

2360
01:46:28,550 --> 01:46:29,383
So with chimps,
chimps have giant balls because all 

2361
01:46:30,741 --> 01:46:31,574
chimp women are hoes and these bitches.
Just slinging that pussy from branch to 

2362
01:46:35,211 --> 01:46:37,080
branch.
It's not white.

2363
01:46:37,120 --> 01:46:37,953
Dick's human decks evolve to have that 
little hook at the end of scoop out the 

2364
01:46:40,730 --> 01:46:41,563
competitors seem.
That's why the bigger head is more 

2365
01:46:43,341 --> 01:46:47,600
successful because it's like a plunger 
and there pulls it out to circumcision.

2366
01:46:47,601 --> 01:46:49,290
Fuck that up.
I wonder.

2367
01:46:49,380 --> 01:46:51,750
I bet it does.
I'm sure.

2368
01:46:51,990 --> 01:46:53,160
I'm sure it would.
Yeah.

2369
01:46:53,230 --> 01:46:56,090
You're going to hear all about this 
tonight at the icehouse circumcision.

2370
01:46:56,100 --> 01:46:57,960
I used to have a whole series of bits 
about it.

2371
01:46:57,990 --> 01:46:58,830
Really?
Yeah.

2372
01:46:58,860 --> 01:46:59,540
Yeah.
It's.

2373
01:46:59,540 --> 01:47:02,700
It's insane.
It's one of the last insane rituals that

2374
01:47:02,720 --> 01:47:06,600
we almost universally,
right people lose penises every year.

2375
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:07,793
There are many kids every year that lose
their penis due to infection where they 

2376
01:47:10,471 --> 01:47:11,304
never get a dick their entire life 
because somebody wanted to go through a 

2377
01:47:13,081 --> 01:47:14,730
ritualistic Dick.

2378
01:47:14,730 --> 01:47:15,563
Skin cutting and a bait beside the 
religious argument for it and also the 

2379
01:47:18,991 --> 01:47:20,850
sanitation argument no longer makes 
sense.

2380
01:47:21,150 --> 01:47:23,040
We had purell.
Now we can disinfect.

2381
01:47:24,270 --> 01:47:25,103
It's such a stupid argument.
It's like in the argument is that 

2382
01:47:27,810 --> 01:47:28,643
there's a direct connection to the 
amount of people who are uncircumcised 

2383
01:47:32,791 --> 01:47:36,870
who also have HIV in Africa.
The way it was explained to me like,

2384
01:47:36,871 --> 01:47:37,704
yeah,
but the people that are uncircumcised 

2385
01:47:39,300 --> 01:47:43,170
also probably weren't taking care of 
themselves,

2386
01:47:43,171 --> 01:47:44,004
weren't in a good family environment 
where they went through ritualistic 

2387
01:47:46,291 --> 01:47:48,300
things,
who knows what they were exposed to,

2388
01:47:48,600 --> 01:47:49,433
what can I intervene intravenous drugs?
What kind of lack of food and 

2389
01:47:51,841 --> 01:47:54,450
nourishment?
What kind of diseases do they encounter?

2390
01:47:54,451 --> 01:47:56,350
The crush their immune system.
You know,

2391
01:47:56,400 --> 01:47:57,720
what part of Africa they.
Yeah.

2392
01:47:57,721 --> 01:47:58,860
What,
what is the prevalence?

2393
01:47:59,040 --> 01:47:59,873
Have they actually been tested positive 
for HIV or as we were dealing with a t 

2394
01:48:02,281 --> 01:48:03,114
cell count issue,
like what has this been establish that 

2395
01:48:04,831 --> 01:48:06,520
these people have aids?
Like what?

2396
01:48:06,780 --> 01:48:07,530
What's causing it?

2397
01:48:07,530 --> 01:48:08,490
Well,
there's also all this,

2398
01:48:08,530 --> 01:48:09,363
um,
these metrics coming out now that it's 

2399
01:48:10,441 --> 01:48:12,120
emotionally traumatizing,
which makes it,

2400
01:48:12,250 --> 01:48:15,330
which makes it,
that men can't express their feelings.

2401
01:48:15,360 --> 01:48:16,193
Eighty percent of the men that are 
circumcised have a harder time 

2402
01:48:17,551 --> 01:48:19,050
expressing their feelings.
It was like something I read.

2403
01:48:19,380 --> 01:48:20,400
And uh,
yeah,

2404
01:48:20,430 --> 01:48:21,263
because the only woman that you have 
ever met gives you a stranger when 

2405
01:48:24,211 --> 01:48:28,110
you're five days old and cuts your Dick 
off in front of people.

2406
01:48:28,111 --> 01:48:28,944
And when you start crying,
they just start clapping and taking 

2407
01:48:31,381 --> 01:48:32,214
pictures.
Of course you're going to not distrust 

2408
01:48:33,430 --> 01:48:33,740
one.

2409
01:48:33,740 --> 01:48:35,620
Literally heard this come out of a 
lady's mouth.

2410
01:48:35,621 --> 01:48:38,220
I did it to my son because I don't want 
it to look gross for him.

2411
01:48:40,060 --> 01:48:41,440
Oh my God.
She's like,

2412
01:48:41,500 --> 01:48:45,340
I don't want to a little gross called 
child services.

2413
01:48:45,360 --> 01:48:48,180
So you're allowed to do it.
That's what's crazy of circumcision.

2414
01:48:48,880 --> 01:48:49,713
It is insane that it has even legal.
Imagine if it didn't exist and then 

2415
01:48:52,330 --> 01:48:56,520
someone came along off women's vaginas.
There would be riots in the story.

2416
01:48:56,650 --> 01:48:57,483
I mean,
I've heard some really crazy fucking 

2417
01:48:58,811 --> 01:48:59,644
arguments from people that are super 
ultra progressive that start going down 

2418
01:49:02,471 --> 01:49:05,230
the rabbit hole with Islam where they 
don't want to criticize anything.

2419
01:49:05,990 --> 01:49:09,640
Someone called it egalitarianism.
Gender Surgery.

2420
01:49:10,090 --> 01:49:10,923
That the,
the genital mutilation was some sort of 

2421
01:49:13,330 --> 01:49:16,390
egalitarian gender surgery as like men 
and women.

2422
01:49:16,610 --> 01:49:17,340
Yeah,
women.

2423
01:49:17,340 --> 01:49:18,880
But women,
women,

2424
01:49:19,240 --> 01:49:21,760
women,
which is to cut off your clit.

2425
01:49:21,761 --> 01:49:22,660
It's not the same thing.

2426
01:49:23,170 --> 01:49:25,140
A lot of porn stars do that first set of
Grayson,

2427
01:49:25,141 --> 01:49:26,530
Slavia Prostate,
you know,

2428
01:49:26,531 --> 01:49:28,870
like in porn will cut their clinicals.
The enemy.

2429
01:49:28,871 --> 01:49:29,704
Yes.
Do you ever see a vagina cut their 

2430
01:49:30,671 --> 01:49:31,491
currency?
Vagina?

2431
01:49:31,491 --> 01:49:32,770
You want me to draw it?
You're a few.

2432
01:49:32,771 --> 01:49:34,660
See vaginas that don't have the chicken 
gizzard?

2433
01:49:34,720 --> 01:49:36,310
No,
that's the Labia plasty.

2434
01:49:36,311 --> 01:49:39,220
And they do it for aesthetic reasons 
because they have the,

2435
01:49:39,880 --> 01:49:41,290
they've got that like,
you know,

2436
01:49:41,890 --> 01:49:43,520
the mud flaps,
but yeah,

2437
01:49:43,570 --> 01:49:46,960
they've got the kind of of Oyster vibe 
going but this,

2438
01:49:47,050 --> 01:49:48,130
the tourists get cut

2439
01:49:48,130 --> 01:49:51,760
there as well,
which is like you guys are watching porn

2440
01:49:51,761 --> 01:49:52,594
with these girls that don't,
that are generally mutilated and aren't 

2441
01:49:54,311 --> 01:49:56,710
even having orgasms.
And you're being lied to.

2442
01:49:57,250 --> 01:49:58,240
Yeah.
Yeah.

2443
01:49:58,241 --> 01:50:00,430
So if the vagina doesn't have this on 
it,

2444
01:50:01,480 --> 01:50:05,740
you know them.
They went to one of those,

2445
01:50:05,741 --> 01:50:10,220
a strip mall plastic surgeons and got 
that thing shaved off nights.

2446
01:50:10,450 --> 01:50:12,160
It's like you.
I've seen porn where I'm like,

2447
01:50:12,190 --> 01:50:14,710
where's her Lavia?
What is going on?

2448
01:50:14,950 --> 01:50:15,783
They're just cutting them right off to 
numb the outside edge of your pussy and 

2449
01:50:19,460 --> 01:50:24,460
resetting the attractive.
Yeah.

2450
01:50:25,140 --> 01:50:25,750
No.
And,

2451
01:50:25,750 --> 01:50:29,020
and that is what's causing so many 
problems because you're seeing that fake

2452
01:50:29,021 --> 01:50:30,490
vagina and then you see a real one and 
you're like,

2453
01:50:30,491 --> 01:50:31,211
oh,
this is ugly.

2454
01:50:31,211 --> 01:50:31,600
It's like,
no,

2455
01:50:31,600 --> 01:50:32,433
this is just what a vagina looks like.
It's like the new voluntary female 

2456
01:50:35,531 --> 01:50:37,200
circumcision.
Sorry,

2457
01:50:37,530 --> 01:50:42,530
Toro Hood reduction is.
We do need to change the name of that.

2458
01:50:43,300 --> 01:50:47,570
Look under the hood and everybody.
I'd really rather not a Hoodie,

2459
01:50:47,580 --> 01:50:48,413
a Hoodie.
That's at least a little more daring 

2460
01:50:49,540 --> 01:50:52,120
relatively.
Oh my God.

2461
01:50:52,180 --> 01:50:53,530
Was it worth it?
Look at this.

2462
01:50:53,531 --> 01:50:54,364
Reviews costs pictures.
I have friends who have gotten the 

2463
01:50:59,321 --> 01:51:02,470
vaginal rejuvenation surgery and they 
said it was more painful than childbirth

2464
01:51:03,080 --> 01:51:07,990
and what they do is they ask you do you 
want to go back to 16,

2465
01:51:07,991 --> 01:51:08,824
18 or 21.
They ask you what age you want to go 

2466
01:51:10,271 --> 01:51:15,271
back to 12 girls at different amounts of
sex at those ages.

2467
01:51:17,231 --> 01:51:20,530
So it's like I want her 21,
not my 21.

2468
01:51:21,850 --> 01:51:22,683
Fuck kind of question is.
I know it's disproportionate to the 

2469
01:51:25,270 --> 01:51:26,103
amount of people that get circumcisions 
versus the amount of people to get 

2470
01:51:28,091 --> 01:51:29,240
Libya.
Libya.

2471
01:51:29,830 --> 01:51:33,490
That rejection is somewhat consent.
I mean you're choosing to do it.

2472
01:51:33,491 --> 01:51:34,324
I mean,
you probably aren't all there if you're 

2473
01:51:36,371 --> 01:51:37,204
a porn star anyway,
but like I just think doing it when 

2474
01:51:39,131 --> 01:51:41,080
you're five days old isn't particularly 
fair.

2475
01:51:41,320 --> 01:51:43,870
It's so unfair.
It's so crazy that it's the norm.

2476
01:51:44,140 --> 01:51:44,973
It's more common than norm.
I think something like 75 percent of 

2477
01:51:48,011 --> 01:51:48,844
American men,
it's so unnecessary and it doesn't do 

2478
01:51:50,651 --> 01:51:52,180
any good.
It's not,

2479
01:51:52,270 --> 01:51:56,890
and it gives some numbness to do you 
know guys who are uncircumcised that say

2480
01:51:56,891 --> 01:51:59,320
it feels way better when you're 
uncircumcised?

2481
01:51:59,350 --> 01:52:00,131
Yeah,
exactly.

2482
01:52:00,131 --> 01:52:00,964
How do you.
I'm just talking shit but might be 

2483
01:52:03,791 --> 01:52:06,580
worse,
but it's a thin layer of mucous develops

2484
01:52:06,581 --> 01:52:09,670
over the head of the Deq where it's like
protected by the skin.

2485
01:52:09,671 --> 01:52:12,160
It stays moist in there and supposedly 
more sensitive.

2486
01:52:12,410 --> 01:52:14,650
Whereas after you've had your four skin 
remove this,

2487
01:52:14,651 --> 01:52:18,610
dried out so numb,
but also cut some nerve endings,

2488
01:52:18,940 --> 01:52:19,990
which is actually,
you know what?

2489
01:52:19,991 --> 01:52:22,140
Maybe you guys do need less nerve 
endings.

2490
01:52:22,150 --> 01:52:24,700
I actually think if all men weren't 
circumcised,

2491
01:52:24,701 --> 01:52:25,534
nothing would ever get done.
That's probably jerking off all day if 

2492
01:52:28,920 --> 01:52:29,753
you can.
If everybody gets sucked around Dick 

2493
01:52:31,740 --> 01:52:32,573
circumcised.
That's the reason why everybody comes 

2494
01:52:34,211 --> 01:52:35,044
like just short.
Maybe that's why our country has such a 

2495
01:52:37,271 --> 01:52:41,050
prolific GDP because the men are 
circumcised and it does suck.

2496
01:52:41,500 --> 01:52:44,210
If sex felt any better,
we'd have a real problem on our end.

2497
01:52:44,211 --> 01:52:46,250
Maybe if you go to a and it's like super

2498
01:52:46,250 --> 01:52:47,150
advanced,
you know,

2499
01:52:47,151 --> 01:52:47,984
that the dick size is directly 
proportional to the face to how far the 

2500
01:52:51,621 --> 01:52:53,480
face can get down on most men.

2501
01:52:54,600 --> 01:52:55,980
They're on deck.
I'm just curious.

2502
01:52:56,040 --> 01:52:56,930
Oh yeah,
there's a dude.

2503
01:52:57,040 --> 01:52:57,873
There's a dude online that uh,
someone sent me a video of this guy 

2504
01:53:00,721 --> 01:53:03,090
literally fucking his own face.
It was so disturbing.

2505
01:53:03,300 --> 01:53:06,740
He was doing a shoulder press.
Yeah.

2506
01:53:06,741 --> 01:53:08,760
Yeah.
He was doing a shoulder press,

2507
01:53:08,770 --> 01:53:11,310
whereas like his neck was flat on the 
ground.

2508
01:53:11,311 --> 01:53:12,144
Okay.
And then his body was like super 

2509
01:53:13,591 --> 01:53:17,370
flexible and it was up like his back was
this and he was bent over,

2510
01:53:17,371 --> 01:53:20,490
so down that he was literally deep 
throating his own deck.

2511
01:53:20,700 --> 01:53:22,650
And then he,
he just,

2512
01:53:23,300 --> 01:53:24,133
his own mouth pulled out,
like kept jizzing on its own phase and 

2513
01:53:27,231 --> 01:53:30,060
then stuck it back in his mouth again.
Yeah.

2514
01:53:30,070 --> 01:53:34,520
And I saw it and I can't unsay it.
Somebody sent it to me.

2515
01:53:34,521 --> 01:53:38,560
It was an animated Gif and I was like,
you motherfucker can't believe.

2516
01:53:38,900 --> 01:53:42,170
How about that one that Nick Swardson 
sent us the other day with the fist.

2517
01:53:43,530 --> 01:53:48,530
You didn't remember that one guy that 
fucking asshole nick.

2518
01:53:48,980 --> 01:53:51,830
And he said stuff.
Nick sends me.

2519
01:53:51,831 --> 01:53:54,830
It's just I've become desensitized to 
it.

2520
01:53:55,130 --> 01:53:55,963
It's a guy carrying a guys.
If I imagine if you had a backpack in 

2521
01:53:59,061 --> 01:53:59,894
front of you,
you have a couple of chains going with 

2522
01:54:01,191 --> 01:54:04,490
the three of us go a girl with a gun?
No,

2523
01:54:04,960 --> 01:54:08,690
it's one where a guy literally,
it's like his arm is soaped up.

2524
01:54:08,930 --> 01:54:09,763
There's all white foam all over his arm 
and he's got a guy and he is like 

2525
01:54:13,310 --> 01:54:14,143
literally elbow deep inside of this 
guy's ass and he's picking them up and 

2526
01:54:17,451 --> 01:54:19,810
putting them down.
And the sledding fist.

2527
01:54:20,300 --> 01:54:21,700
It could be anything.
I don't.

2528
01:54:21,820 --> 01:54:26,820
No bear spray.
Hold up Mr.

2529
01:54:30,190 --> 01:54:34,950
Mace I fuck with Mace is a fucking lube.
I'm looking through our chain and it's,

2530
01:54:35,070 --> 01:54:36,950
it's pretty horrific.
Yeah.

2531
01:54:36,951 --> 01:54:39,000
There's a lot of horrific shit and that 
shit.

2532
01:54:39,060 --> 01:54:39,893
Oh,
I see.

2533
01:54:39,900 --> 01:54:42,250
Wait,
is this the thing with the guys goes?

2534
01:54:42,320 --> 01:54:44,690
He said,
yeah,

2535
01:54:44,691 --> 01:54:45,524
that's it.
Oh,

2536
01:54:45,590 --> 01:54:47,210
click on it.
Oh God,

2537
01:54:47,211 --> 01:54:48,044
I don't know this.
This might be more upsetting than r 

2538
01:54:49,261 --> 01:54:51,310
Kelly.
Real tall weight.

2539
01:54:51,330 --> 01:54:55,580
It's not playing so it's still know what
is this?

2540
01:54:56,030 --> 01:54:57,020
No,
that's not the one.

2541
01:54:57,200 --> 01:54:59,010
Sorry.
That's the one where dudes fucking to do

2542
01:54:59,020 --> 01:54:59,853
that,
but that's still the one with all of us 

2543
01:55:02,211 --> 01:55:06,390
together is a isn't there a way you can 
do it?

2544
01:55:06,840 --> 01:55:07,673
There's a way you can go to just the 
things that had been texted and just he 

2545
01:55:09,531 --> 01:55:11,240
gets drunk and it'll just hurt your 
feelings.

2546
01:55:11,810 --> 01:55:13,340
Animated gift like,
Hey,

2547
01:55:14,270 --> 01:55:18,410
one quick adrenaline and I'm learning a 
lot on this text chain.

2548
01:55:18,470 --> 01:55:20,160
You can learn a lot.
Humbling.

2549
01:55:20,180 --> 01:55:21,220
Quite frankly.
I'm like,

2550
01:55:21,230 --> 01:55:23,510
am I supposed to be doing this?
Am I supposed to be doing this?

2551
01:55:23,511 --> 01:55:26,210
Is this what the kids are doing?
I can't.

2552
01:55:26,510 --> 01:55:27,343
I can't keep up with this stuff.
No one can keep up with anything 

2553
01:55:29,040 --> 01:55:30,430
anymore.
Establish what.

2554
01:55:30,520 --> 01:55:31,700
Who is that a real thing?

2555
01:55:32,720 --> 01:55:36,060
You're willing to take it to a level,
sort of like ultra marathon running,

2556
01:55:36,540 --> 01:55:37,980
you know,
like why are you running 200,

2557
01:55:37,981 --> 01:55:41,220
five miles?
You just taking it at durance and mental

2558
01:55:41,221 --> 01:55:44,310
strength to a level that very few people
can to fisting

2559
01:55:44,310 --> 01:55:45,143
is not only why I let you fuck my ass,
but I'll let you ball up your chickens 

2560
01:55:50,490 --> 01:55:55,200
pause and the whole design.
That's a pathological.

2561
01:55:55,300 --> 01:55:59,070
I'm saying why do people get their face 
pierced?

2562
01:55:59,160 --> 01:56:02,340
Why?
Why do people have robot?

2563
01:56:03,840 --> 01:56:06,670
I want to be stigmatized and I want to 
be a part of a tribe,

2564
01:56:06,671 --> 01:56:10,620
but like getting fisted in private.
It's not about acceptance or maladaptive

2565
01:56:10,621 --> 01:56:11,730
behavior.
That's like,

2566
01:56:11,920 --> 01:56:13,940
it's about taking things to the next 
level.

2567
01:56:14,970 --> 01:56:15,803
Like a lot of things people do sexually 
is to try to freak out the other 

2568
01:56:18,990 --> 01:56:21,360
partner,
to let them know that they're on another

2569
01:56:21,361 --> 01:56:22,194
level.
Like I'm on some super freak level it 

2570
01:56:23,770 --> 01:56:26,340
put in my ass baby.
Like I'm at the point where I'm like,

2571
01:56:26,341 --> 01:56:29,580
you know,
it'd be really kinky missionary.

2572
01:56:30,580 --> 01:56:32,880
Like the craziest thing you can do these
days.

2573
01:56:32,881 --> 01:56:34,080
Yeah,
let's get crazy.

2574
01:56:34,290 --> 01:56:36,630
Let's kiss during sex and I'll be on the
bottom,

2575
01:56:37,050 --> 01:56:38,190
but some people know,
right?

2576
01:56:38,190 --> 01:56:39,023
Some people want to do freak shit and 
then if someone's going to want to do 

2577
01:56:41,491 --> 01:56:42,324
freaky shit,
there's always gonna be someone who 

2578
01:56:43,251 --> 01:56:44,880
wants to take it to the next level and 
show,

2579
01:56:44,881 --> 01:56:46,590
you know,
I'm a super freak.

2580
01:56:46,810 --> 01:56:49,680
I'm not a regular fee.
He could fill me motherfucker.

2581
01:56:49,740 --> 01:56:52,200
But then the next thing you know,
do you think that this is all the people

2582
01:56:52,201 --> 01:56:56,040
who don't get to do what you get to do 
and fight people and do comedy.

2583
01:56:56,041 --> 01:56:59,460
Like people that don't get to get those 
extreme needs met,

2584
01:57:00,720 --> 01:57:01,553
they might not have ever found a path 
for them to sort of express themselves 

2585
01:57:04,771 --> 01:57:05,604
through and then they're,
they're spiraling out of control with 

2586
01:57:07,381 --> 01:57:08,214
like poor programming and shitty 
relationships with their family and 

2587
01:57:12,480 --> 01:57:16,930
friends that are fucked up.
And all that leads to someone fist up to

2588
01:57:17,050 --> 01:57:20,460
your sign up for an open mic at the 
comedy store or something else.

2589
01:57:20,460 --> 01:57:21,000
You know?
I mean,

2590
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:21,833
the thing is like everybody's 
personality would lend itself to a 

2591
01:57:24,240 --> 01:57:27,060
different kind of pursuit and it's one 
of the real problems.

2592
01:57:27,061 --> 01:57:29,040
Like some sort of a cookie cutter 
existence,

2593
01:57:29,290 --> 01:57:30,123
like the idea that you in any way,
shape or form would be most happy in a 

2594
01:57:32,971 --> 01:57:35,820
cubicle is patently insane.
It's insane.

2595
01:57:35,830 --> 01:57:37,110
Insane.
Literally.

2596
01:57:37,111 --> 01:57:37,944
Oh look,
you're good to put your star wars toys 

2597
01:57:39,121 --> 01:57:39,954
up in the typical nerd guy.
Is fisting new because we're all in 

2598
01:57:47,251 --> 01:57:49,980
cubicles or has it always been around?
Even when we were fighting each other in

2599
01:57:49,981 --> 01:57:50,731
the streets?
Well,

2600
01:57:50,731 --> 01:57:52,410
you got to think during the Roman 
Empire,

2601
01:57:52,411 --> 01:57:54,630
somebody fisted somebody right?
Constantly.

2602
01:57:54,660 --> 01:57:56,910
For sure.
They were going so deep.

2603
01:57:56,911 --> 01:57:58,050
They were crazy.
They were.

2604
01:57:58,080 --> 01:58:01,380
They were literally trying to be as 
hedonistic as possible.

2605
01:58:01,470 --> 01:58:02,303
I was just.
I was just at the Coliseum and amazing 

2606
01:58:05,700 --> 01:58:08,130
and I don't know that much about it,
but it was funny.

2607
01:58:08,130 --> 01:58:09,510
I was like,
this is fucking barbaric,

2608
01:58:09,540 --> 01:58:13,740
and the tour guide was like a.
nothing is as barbaric as nfl.

2609
01:58:13,960 --> 01:58:15,600
Like these.
She was like,

2610
01:58:15,630 --> 01:58:16,463
these were like criminals.
These are people who were going to die 

2611
01:58:18,571 --> 01:58:19,404
anyway.
They only did these spites once every 

2612
01:58:21,840 --> 01:58:23,010
couple months if the emperor wasn't into
it.

2613
01:58:23,011 --> 01:58:24,300
They didn't do it at all.
They were like,

2614
01:58:24,301 --> 01:58:25,134
you guys routinely have people killing 
each other on television and you guys 

2615
01:58:29,411 --> 01:58:31,110
chair?
Yeah,

2616
01:58:31,200 --> 01:58:33,470
sort of.
They brought in lions,

2617
01:58:34,200 --> 01:58:37,140
animals.
They were but allied animals extinct.

2618
01:58:37,870 --> 01:58:38,703
Yeah.
They made species of animals extinct 

2619
01:58:40,081 --> 01:58:41,770
because they used them in the coliseum 
so much.

2620
01:58:41,830 --> 01:58:42,663
I

2621
01:58:42,670 --> 01:58:44,250
didn't know that.
Oh yeah.

2622
01:58:44,330 --> 01:58:44,660
Good.

2623
01:58:44,660 --> 01:58:45,493
That up.
I read that just a few days ago that 

2624
01:58:47,020 --> 01:58:47,853
they were talking about what they were 
doing was actually reenacting wars that 

2625
01:58:50,790 --> 01:58:52,160
were.
Because they didn't have newspapers.

2626
01:58:52,161 --> 01:58:54,410
They were like doing reenactments and 
stuff and people will get injured,

2627
01:58:54,411 --> 01:58:55,244
but a lot of them,
when they told you they put water in 

2628
01:58:56,451 --> 01:58:58,610
there and had boat fights,
you're like,

2629
01:58:58,611 --> 01:58:59,151
what?
What?

2630
01:58:59,151 --> 01:59:00,120
How?
What?

2631
01:59:00,170 --> 01:59:01,790
Why were you guys more advanced than we 
are today?

2632
01:59:01,940 --> 01:59:03,710
They had seaworld,
seaworld.

2633
01:59:03,711 --> 01:59:06,410
They had like a show,
like they have actually seaworld show,

2634
01:59:06,590 --> 01:59:09,450
like a water world show at universal.
Oh really?

2635
01:59:09,760 --> 01:59:10,551
I didn't know that.
Yeah,

2636
01:59:10,551 --> 01:59:11,384
it's fucking pretty bad at it.
It's like this choreographed waterworld 

2637
01:59:15,200 --> 01:59:16,940
scenarios.
People,

2638
01:59:17,150 --> 01:59:19,730
people shooting at each other and shit.
What is this?

2639
01:59:19,910 --> 01:59:22,220
Who fighting killed off whole species?
Yeah,

2640
01:59:22,221 --> 01:59:24,920
the sheer quantity and slaughter in the 
coliseum.

2641
01:59:25,070 --> 01:59:25,903
Saw the number of lines Jaguars and 
tigers plummet across the globe 

2642
01:59:29,060 --> 01:59:29,893
according to some Roman hunting,
absolutely devastated the wildlife of 

2643
01:59:32,451 --> 01:59:35,540
North Africa and the entire 
Mediterranean region,

2644
01:59:35,541 --> 01:59:38,240
wiping some species of animals off the 
map.

2645
01:59:38,270 --> 01:59:41,380
Entirely thousand

2646
01:59:41,540 --> 01:59:43,960
animals,
particularly irritable

2647
01:59:44,270 --> 01:59:47,900
set of games in which 9,000
animals are slaughtered.

2648
01:59:48,470 --> 01:59:51,320
The hippo disappeared from the River 
Nile at North Africa.

2649
01:59:51,350 --> 01:59:52,183
They were fighting elephants that will 
use an elephants and lions and and some 

2650
01:59:56,091 --> 01:59:59,480
of the lines escaped and Tigers had 
leaped to the front.

2651
01:59:59,481 --> 02:00:00,314
Rows were the richest people lived or 
the richest people have their seats and 

2652
02:00:03,081 --> 02:00:03,914
killed the richest people and so they 
had to develop these fence systems all 

2653
02:00:06,861 --> 02:00:08,690
around and they had to raise the whole 
thing.

2654
02:00:08,691 --> 02:00:09,524
This guy was like explaining how they 
had to protect the rich people sat in 

2655
02:00:11,871 --> 02:00:12,610
the front row.

2656
02:00:12,610 --> 02:00:16,450
I think that's fucking amazing.
Those lions are awesome.

2657
02:00:16,730 --> 02:00:17,563
Could you.
I hear they're going to start putting 

2658
02:00:19,151 --> 02:00:22,120
nets up at baseball games.
Going to be from baseball.

2659
02:00:22,130 --> 02:00:24,710
Baby got hit by a ball,
got a baby,

2660
02:00:24,920 --> 02:00:29,920
baby,
baby nets and all the baby to a baseball

2661
02:00:30,371 --> 02:00:31,630
game.
Is the baby dead?

2662
02:00:31,890 --> 02:00:32,830
I don't know.
I didn't ask,

2663
02:00:33,190 --> 02:00:34,640
I didn't want it now,
but there's going to be no,

2664
02:00:34,760 --> 02:00:38,050
it happened in hockey after a girl got 
hit by a puck and where I'm from,

2665
02:00:38,580 --> 02:00:39,413
but hockey pucks slow down,
but baseball's like don't as quickly or 

2666
02:00:44,201 --> 02:00:46,030
something.
It killed her.

2667
02:00:46,300 --> 02:00:47,560
She died.
The girl in Columbus died.

2668
02:00:47,561 --> 02:00:50,200
That's why they have nets up all over.
Like every entrepreneur.

2669
02:00:50,900 --> 02:00:54,940
The pucks aren't flying into the crowd.
It used to get hit by a puck.

2670
02:00:54,970 --> 02:00:55,803
No,
used to be a thing to catch a puck when 

2671
02:00:56,771 --> 02:00:57,604
it came into the crowd,
like a foul ball and baseball because 

2672
02:00:59,441 --> 02:01:00,760
they would flip over and whatnot.

2673
02:01:00,760 --> 02:01:03,930
But they started flying because people 
got better and hidden faster.

2674
02:01:03,931 --> 02:01:05,970
Slap shots.
So they had.

2675
02:01:05,971 --> 02:01:08,200
Now there's like a net up almost.
You almost can't.

2676
02:01:08,450 --> 02:01:09,283
A hockey arena at least nhl.
Where did it hit her in like a like I 

2677
02:01:14,410 --> 02:01:15,430
think it here in the head.
Yeah.

2678
02:01:15,470 --> 02:01:18,490
I'm sure she wasn't sitting very super 
close,

2679
02:01:18,491 --> 02:01:20,830
but I mean most good seats now.
So they're all good seats,

2680
02:01:20,831 --> 02:01:21,810
et cetera.
Hit it.

2681
02:01:22,590 --> 02:01:25,850
I'll get in trouble.
I mean I guess get a pat on this.

2682
02:01:25,870 --> 02:01:28,170
Is your mom yelling you?
Well that one guy got mom,

2683
02:01:28,180 --> 02:01:29,013
I killed that lady in the audience.
Do you do you get paid more money 

2684
02:01:31,361 --> 02:01:32,194
because you're so good at hitting and I 
got an assault charge that for hitting 

2685
02:01:35,801 --> 02:01:37,720
the guy with the stick,
but that was like player on player.

2686
02:01:38,050 --> 02:01:40,130
That's different.
Illegal or within

2687
02:01:40,160 --> 02:01:40,993
sexual assault.
Under ticket it says like you're 

2688
02:01:43,040 --> 02:01:43,873
assuming all the risk of potential debt,
whatever can happen to you at the event 

2689
02:01:47,120 --> 02:01:48,300
eating puck,
but yeah,

2690
02:01:48,301 --> 02:01:50,090
so now,
but now I'm.

2691
02:01:50,120 --> 02:01:52,280
All baseball fields are going to have 
nuts.

2692
02:01:52,780 --> 02:01:55,220
Some of the worst idea in the world.
People died from it,

2693
02:01:55,460 --> 02:01:56,293
but the nerfing of the world continues 
to say you can't bring children and 

2694
02:02:00,411 --> 02:02:01,244
babies.
Baseball just different because it's 

2695
02:02:02,241 --> 02:02:03,510
like American mass time.
Yeah.

2696
02:02:03,530 --> 02:02:06,050
I think you should wear gloves and don't
bring a baby.

2697
02:02:06,110 --> 02:02:08,990
That's my take on it and if the ball's 
coming,

2698
02:02:09,170 --> 02:02:10,610
you got to be paying attention all the 
time.

2699
02:02:10,640 --> 02:02:11,473
Don't leave your kid alone.
You've got to be there with the fucking 

2700
02:02:13,731 --> 02:02:14,564
glove tonight.
Mayor should be able to show that you 

2701
02:02:16,581 --> 02:02:20,000
can catch a 90 mile an hour.
I mean,

2702
02:02:20,010 --> 02:02:20,843
do you think that,
is that going to like kill baseball to 

2703
02:02:22,191 --> 02:02:23,480
have to look through nets?

2704
02:02:23,990 --> 02:02:24,823
Well,
what's happened to all sports is their 

2705
02:02:26,181 --> 02:02:27,440
nerf and things up.
Right?

2706
02:02:27,441 --> 02:02:28,274
And that's the big thing that Donald 
Trump got criticized for the most was 

2707
02:02:31,881 --> 02:02:33,670
when he said that the,
uh,

2708
02:02:33,740 --> 02:02:35,570
not just the thing about the players 
kneeling,

2709
02:02:35,780 --> 02:02:36,613
what?
That they're killing the game with all 

2710
02:02:37,851 --> 02:02:39,080
these safety regulations.
Like,

2711
02:02:39,160 --> 02:02:40,000
wait a minute,
man,

2712
02:02:40,390 --> 02:02:41,260
regulations.
These people are,

2713
02:02:42,060 --> 02:02:42,893
they're changing the rules at 35,
all of a sudden they are getting fucked 

2714
02:02:46,460 --> 02:02:47,293
up and do something.
All the things that are supposedly 

2715
02:02:50,211 --> 02:02:51,044
making them safer,
the helmets are actually becoming 

2716
02:02:52,191 --> 02:02:53,810
weapons and the things that they're 
entering each other.

2717
02:02:53,820 --> 02:02:56,140
But the people that believe that.
And I,

2718
02:02:56,141 --> 02:02:59,930
I tend to believe that a rugby is a 
superior sport.

2719
02:03:00,280 --> 02:03:02,900
I was no helmet,
no helmets,

2720
02:03:02,901 --> 02:03:03,471
no helmet.
See,

2721
02:03:03,471 --> 02:03:05,930
I'm not a fan of either one.
Not that I don't.

2722
02:03:05,990 --> 02:03:08,080
If I wanted to walk,
if I had to choose to watch one,

2723
02:03:08,081 --> 02:03:09,820
since I don't give a fuck who wins the 
superbowl?

2724
02:03:09,970 --> 02:03:10,930
I don't,
I don't watch it.

2725
02:03:10,931 --> 02:03:12,980
Right?
But about choose to watch somebody said,

2726
02:03:12,981 --> 02:03:14,540
hey,
you wanna go to a rugby game or football

2727
02:03:14,541 --> 02:03:15,970
game.
Like I want to go see a rugby game.

2728
02:03:15,971 --> 02:03:16,804
Yeah.
They don't have any helmets or pads on 

2729
02:03:17,811 --> 02:03:18,644
like that's real,
but they're not hitting each other the 

2730
02:03:20,031 --> 02:03:22,190
way that they do and can't.
You would die.

2731
02:03:22,280 --> 02:03:23,570
You would.
You'd break your body,

2732
02:03:23,571 --> 02:03:25,580
you'd break your teammates.
Everybody would get fucked up.

2733
02:03:25,581 --> 02:03:27,170
They hit each other a lot.
Don't get me wrong.

2734
02:03:27,171 --> 02:03:28,004
It's a rough game,
but it's a smarter and it's more 

2735
02:03:29,901 --> 02:03:32,690
realistic game.
It's like putting on this stupid outfit.

2736
02:03:33,050 --> 02:03:35,180
No offense guys,
but all that shit.

2737
02:03:35,181 --> 02:03:36,890
You're doing all those.
If you're such a bad ass,

2738
02:03:36,891 --> 02:03:39,140
why do y'all pads on?
Like what is this?

2739
02:03:39,410 --> 02:03:40,243
The only reason why you're able to run 
at each other full clip is because of 

2740
02:03:42,350 --> 02:03:43,580
past crazy.

2741
02:03:44,060 --> 02:03:44,893
Take that stupid shit off and you'll get
a more honest representation of what's 

2742
02:03:48,201 --> 02:03:49,034
possible when people collide with each 
other and you'll have way less scaled 

2743
02:03:52,091 --> 02:03:54,410
ahead of just brute force.
Exactly.

2744
02:03:54,411 --> 02:03:56,600
Do you think there will ever be a day 
where there's no nfl?

2745
02:03:56,840 --> 02:03:57,710
I mean,
no nfl.

2746
02:03:57,711 --> 02:03:58,820
Yeah.
Um,

2747
02:03:59,060 --> 02:04:04,060
I would hope that the NFL would just go 
to a more rugby based system.

2748
02:04:04,521 --> 02:04:05,121
Obviously.
Look,

2749
02:04:05,121 --> 02:04:06,290
I'm an idiot.
Don't listen to me.

2750
02:04:06,470 --> 02:04:10,280
If you're an nfl fan you love,
you don't understand the game relatively

2751
02:04:11,350 --> 02:04:13,220
trivial days.
I don't know shit about nfl,

2752
02:04:13,221 --> 02:04:14,054
but I know that wearing helmets,
like if it's the same thing to me about 

2753
02:04:17,511 --> 02:04:18,344
like striking with boxing gloves,
I think to be bare knuckle I think we'd 

2754
02:04:22,371 --> 02:04:23,600
be safer.
I think you'd have.

2755
02:04:23,660 --> 02:04:27,020
Fighters would have less brain trauma.
You wouldn't even strike less,

2756
02:04:27,280 --> 02:04:30,500
wouldn't be able to just openly start 
wailing on someone.

2757
02:04:30,500 --> 02:04:32,840
You just shatter your hands.
It's not that easy.

2758
02:04:33,200 --> 02:04:36,190
So you're more um,
but you know,

2759
02:04:36,230 --> 02:04:41,230
calculated and much more calculated you.
There's much more emphasis on accuracy.

2760
02:04:41,790 --> 02:04:44,010
You couldn't just hit somebody as hard 
as you want to.

2761
02:04:44,220 --> 02:04:46,350
Like the thing about having pants 
gloves,

2762
02:04:46,630 --> 02:04:48,060
it's like if you're going to punch a 
door,

2763
02:04:48,090 --> 02:04:51,570
right,
like a real wood solid wood door and you

2764
02:04:51,571 --> 02:04:53,820
just knock on that door full blast,
man,

2765
02:04:53,821 --> 02:04:54,654
you're going to get fucking hurt.
But you can kind of punch a door like 

2766
02:04:57,301 --> 02:04:58,980
this.
So you could do that.

2767
02:04:58,981 --> 02:05:02,250
And it doesn't really hurt,
but you can hit some on a bunch of times

2768
02:05:02,251 --> 02:05:05,670
like that and it doesn't hurt you if you
have bare knuckle.

2769
02:05:05,730 --> 02:05:06,563
But if you have pads,
if you have pads on your knuckles 

2770
02:05:09,100 --> 02:05:11,940
pitching and hitting and hitting and 
hitting lamb that table,

2771
02:05:11,941 --> 02:05:15,420
and it doesn't hurt at all.
You're literally not capable of punching

2772
02:05:15,421 --> 02:05:17,670
full blast with knuckles all the time.

2773
02:05:17,760 --> 02:05:20,700
Especially if you hit like an elbow or 
you hit a forehead.

2774
02:05:20,880 --> 02:05:23,340
Guys shatter their hands on people's 
foreheads.

2775
02:05:23,400 --> 02:05:26,980
Your Ford is a dome that's good for 
headbutting like this area.

2776
02:05:28,520 --> 02:05:31,230
It's so hard to break that and you're 
not going to break it with a hand.

2777
02:05:31,740 --> 02:05:33,660
But if you hit someone right here,
it's pretty devastating.

2778
02:05:33,780 --> 02:05:37,020
This is a more softer.
It's more flat.

2779
02:05:37,170 --> 02:05:38,003
You can get a good impact on it.
But if you catch this bridge like a lot 

2780
02:05:41,011 --> 02:05:43,920
of times people break their hand 
catching this bridge.

2781
02:05:44,010 --> 02:05:44,843
So what happens is the curve of the head
runs into the middle of your hand 

2782
02:05:49,450 --> 02:05:51,270
because you're just trying to tee off,
right?

2783
02:05:51,271 --> 02:05:54,390
And if you're in a fight and you're just
trying to swing as hard as you can,

2784
02:05:54,630 --> 02:05:55,463
if you hit forehead and the curve,
that forehead hits the middle of those 

2785
02:05:58,621 --> 02:06:00,100
fingers,
like we're the.

2786
02:06:00,200 --> 02:06:01,620
It's the weakest area.

2787
02:06:01,620 --> 02:06:03,420
It's almost like bends in between the 
joints.

2788
02:06:03,421 --> 02:06:05,700
They snap and they also snapped back 
here.

2789
02:06:05,930 --> 02:06:09,570
The snap on the top of the hand,
particularly the last two knuckles.

2790
02:06:09,840 --> 02:06:12,500
These aren't really connected to the 
rest of your,

2791
02:06:12,530 --> 02:06:13,363
your arm,
these two knuckles or what you're 

2792
02:06:14,641 --> 02:06:17,400
supposed to concentrate on because 
there's sort of reinforced by the risk.

2793
02:06:17,490 --> 02:06:19,620
But they break too.
Your whole hand brakes.

2794
02:06:20,050 --> 02:06:22,050
Fans are super fragile.
Making me wonder,

2795
02:06:22,051 --> 02:06:22,884
like the same way,
like Michael Phelps was just born to 

2796
02:06:24,211 --> 02:06:25,044
swam,
right?

2797
02:06:25,100 --> 02:06:28,220
His Wingspan,
his heart,

2798
02:06:28,230 --> 02:06:29,063
you know,
all that shit.

2799
02:06:29,430 --> 02:06:31,650
Are there people whose faces are just 
born to fight?

2800
02:06:31,680 --> 02:06:32,380
Oh,
for sure.

2801
02:06:32,380 --> 02:06:34,590
Wow.
Faces were born for sure.

2802
02:06:34,890 --> 02:06:37,350
They can take more impact,
wider faces,

2803
02:06:37,351 --> 02:06:39,440
bigger heads,
thicker next for sure.

2804
02:06:39,450 --> 02:06:42,530
They can absorb better.
Everybody can get knocked out because of

2805
02:06:42,531 --> 02:06:43,364
the human body is just so flawed.
Especially if you have like some crazy 

2806
02:06:45,990 --> 02:06:48,300
Alistair overeem type character kick you
in the head,

2807
02:06:48,301 --> 02:06:49,134
anyone can get knocked out,
but it's less likely to get knocked out 

2808
02:06:51,661 --> 02:06:54,240
if you're shaped a certain way and your 
hands,

2809
02:06:54,540 --> 02:06:57,040
the shape of your hands makes a giant 
difference as well.

2810
02:06:57,040 --> 02:06:58,830
It's like how much impact you can 
deliver.

2811
02:06:59,120 --> 02:07:03,390
Like if you have someone like us,
like George Foreman had enormous hands,

2812
02:07:03,890 --> 02:07:04,723
like there's a guy named Francis and 
Ghana was like one of the top UFC 

2813
02:07:06,650 --> 02:07:07,483
heavyweights.
Every time I shake his hands I just go 

2814
02:07:08,431 --> 02:07:13,431
with Jesus.
He's got these fucking hammers,

2815
02:07:13,920 --> 02:07:17,250
like these giant hammers and he just 
knocks people just dead.

2816
02:07:17,670 --> 02:07:19,320
He's,
it's a huge advantage.

2817
02:07:19,390 --> 02:07:20,223
Structural advantage.
It's like the difference between having 

2818
02:07:21,751 --> 02:07:22,584
a ball peen hammer,
a little tiny hammer nails and having a 

2819
02:07:24,691 --> 02:07:27,180
sledge hammer is literally as a 
difference.

2820
02:07:27,590 --> 02:07:28,423
You know?
It's just the having that extra weight 

2821
02:07:29,911 --> 02:07:31,830
on the end as a.
especially if there's a lot of,

2822
02:07:32,310 --> 02:07:34,350
you know,
a lot of body mass behind it as well.

2823
02:07:34,470 --> 02:07:37,570
Just a massive.
You want there to be no gloves,

2824
02:07:37,571 --> 02:07:40,330
so look at his hands,
the sizes motherfucker saying yeah,

2825
02:07:40,350 --> 02:07:42,520
they're enormous.
Seemed Fair.

2826
02:07:42,550 --> 02:07:43,810
There were enormous.

2827
02:07:44,230 --> 02:07:46,810
Yeah.
That's Brian stand by the way.

2828
02:07:46,811 --> 02:07:50,530
Who was the UFC or the WC 205 pound 
champion.

2829
02:07:50,560 --> 02:07:51,610
Okay.
He,

2830
02:07:51,611 --> 02:07:52,860
uh,
was a UFC fighter,

2831
02:07:52,870 --> 02:07:55,690
a top UFC fighter at 185 pounds.
He's a big boy.

2832
02:07:55,720 --> 02:07:56,553
He lives.
His arms get dwarfed by in Ghana whose 

2833
02:07:58,601 --> 02:08:01,940
hands it looks like a stump.
So that,

2834
02:08:01,950 --> 02:08:02,783
that is an undeniable physical advantage
if you can land that punch more dumbed 

2835
02:08:08,251 --> 02:08:09,100
head.
Yeah,

2836
02:08:09,101 --> 02:08:09,934
there's a lot of shit going on.
But my point is that if fights had no 

2837
02:08:12,311 --> 02:08:13,144
pads,
we would get a more accurate 

2838
02:08:14,291 --> 02:08:17,140
representation of what the body can 
really do.

2839
02:08:17,141 --> 02:08:17,974
Instead we're making fighters get more 
damaged because you're letting people 

2840
02:08:21,341 --> 02:08:22,630
tee off.
I don't think you should be able to tape

2841
02:08:22,631 --> 02:08:23,464
your risks either.
I think that's unfair to because you 

2842
02:08:25,650 --> 02:08:27,110
can't.
Gives it,

2843
02:08:27,350 --> 02:08:28,183
make it stiffer so it doesn't buckle as 
much when you impact something because 

2844
02:08:30,941 --> 02:08:32,620
when you hit something of your handles 
like that,

2845
02:08:32,800 --> 02:08:34,270
you can really fuck your wrist up.

2846
02:08:34,270 --> 02:08:36,870
And when you really get torn tendons,
all competition,

2847
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:39,700
they'll put like cement and their gloves
and they have.

2848
02:08:39,910 --> 02:08:40,970
Yeah.
Yeah.

2849
02:08:41,110 --> 02:08:42,840
Margarito did that.
Yeah,

2850
02:08:42,880 --> 02:08:43,660
he,
um,

2851
02:08:43,660 --> 02:08:45,270
he was fighting,
um,

2852
02:08:45,480 --> 02:08:49,510
a bunch of different guys and busting 
them up really bad.

2853
02:08:49,750 --> 02:08:52,270
And then before his fight with sugar,
Shane Mosley,

2854
02:08:52,271 --> 02:08:57,271
they caught him in the locker room with 
plaster in the wraps of the gloves.

2855
02:08:57,850 --> 02:09:00,760
Somebody caught them and then they 
started putting two and two together and

2856
02:09:00,761 --> 02:09:02,650
realizing like when he beat up Miguel 
Cotto,

2857
02:09:02,651 --> 02:09:04,120
when he beat up all these different 
fighters,

2858
02:09:04,630 --> 02:09:07,390
it was an unusual beating.
Like he was hitting them and it was just

2859
02:09:07,391 --> 02:09:08,130
having an,
an,

2860
02:09:08,130 --> 02:09:10,540
an inordinate,
inordinate effect on them.

2861
02:09:10,541 --> 02:09:12,760
Like hitting people way harder than 
anybody else was.

2862
02:09:13,150 --> 02:09:13,983
No one could figure out why.
Once they took that way worse because 

2863
02:09:19,181 --> 02:09:22,600
Lance Armstrong was doing that when 
everybody else was also doing that.

2864
02:09:23,230 --> 02:09:24,063
No one else was putting too much and 
people are gonna start getting 

2865
02:09:27,401 --> 02:09:27,880
suspicious.

2866
02:09:27,880 --> 02:09:28,421
Well,
they weren't,

2867
02:09:28,421 --> 02:09:31,280
he wasn't necessarily beating everybody,
but he was beating a lot of guys.

2868
02:09:31,281 --> 02:09:33,190
And the way he was beating him,
he was fucking them up.

2869
02:09:33,191 --> 02:09:36,310
And then when he got the sugar Shane,
they caught him with the plaster.

2870
02:09:36,430 --> 02:09:37,263
They took it out.
Rewrap his hands and Sugar Shane beat 

2871
02:09:38,891 --> 02:09:40,570
the fuck out of him.
And sugar.

2872
02:09:40,571 --> 02:09:42,460
Shane knew about it.
Everybody knew about it.

2873
02:09:42,461 --> 02:09:43,620
They were talking about it on the,
uh,

2874
02:09:43,630 --> 02:09:44,463
on the broadcast and that they were 
almost not letting him fight and they 

2875
02:09:46,691 --> 02:09:49,470
let him fight with new,
newly wrapped hands and sugar.

2876
02:09:49,471 --> 02:09:51,490
Shane just lit him up like a Christmas 
tree.

2877
02:09:51,491 --> 02:09:54,760
Fucked him up.
And then manny Pacquiao fucked him up to

2878
02:09:55,180 --> 02:09:57,530
everybody fucked up.
Why do you get to.

2879
02:09:57,630 --> 02:09:59,110
I mean,
he should've been.

2880
02:09:59,320 --> 02:10:02,170
He should've been probably retired from 
boxing.

2881
02:10:02,171 --> 02:10:04,420
They should've said there's no way you 
could ever fight again were just like,

2882
02:10:04,450 --> 02:10:05,950
we want to see you get killed a couple 
of times.

2883
02:10:06,580 --> 02:10:07,413
Yeah.
I mean he was never the same guy and he 

2884
02:10:08,351 --> 02:10:13,000
actually wound up fighting.
He had a really badly torn retina to the

2885
02:10:13,001 --> 02:10:13,834
point where I think they put an 
artificial retina from one of the 

2886
02:10:15,611 --> 02:10:17,320
beatings that he took.
I think two sugar.

2887
02:10:17,321 --> 02:10:18,690
Shane.
It might've been the pack.

2888
02:10:18,691 --> 02:10:20,530
Yeah,
it might've been the packout beat him.

2889
02:10:20,750 --> 02:10:21,583
Beat him bad.
There's a couple of guys beat the fuck 

2890
02:10:23,711 --> 02:10:24,544
out of him,
but it's just that guy was putting 

2891
02:10:26,351 --> 02:10:29,350
plaster and his gloves.
Gloves are the way to go.

2892
02:10:29,351 --> 02:10:31,390
I mean if you want to do it for boxing,
I get it.

2893
02:10:31,391 --> 02:10:32,224
Boxing is a completely different sport 
and there's an art to catching punches 

2894
02:10:34,761 --> 02:10:35,594
on the gloves and.
But my thing about mma in particular is 

2895
02:10:38,241 --> 02:10:41,150
why is it okay to elbow someone in the 
face,

2896
02:10:41,540 --> 02:10:45,620
but it's not okay to have gloves that 
are like bare knuckle.

2897
02:10:45,620 --> 02:10:46,453
That's crazy.
You could literally smash someone's 

2898
02:10:48,560 --> 02:10:49,910
reading this and this.
Yeah,

2899
02:10:50,060 --> 02:10:54,290
you could smash someone's head with an 
elbow like right in their eye socket and

2900
02:10:54,291 --> 02:10:55,124
that's totally legal.
You could smash their nose to a pulp 

2901
02:10:56,690 --> 02:11:00,230
that's totally legal,
but some are like a shin.

2902
02:11:00,590 --> 02:11:03,260
You can hit someone so hard with your 
Shin.

2903
02:11:03,530 --> 02:11:06,530
It's a razor blade.
Ultimately it's a baseball bat.

2904
02:11:06,930 --> 02:11:08,900
Kick someone in the head with a shin.
It's crazy.

2905
02:11:08,901 --> 02:11:11,780
There's no padding out of the all,
but you have to have in your fists.

2906
02:11:11,930 --> 02:11:14,150
That's crazy.
Is that it's old.

2907
02:11:14,160 --> 02:11:18,020
We left.
It's when the UFC first came about,

2908
02:11:18,021 --> 02:11:22,460
it was beer and alcohol and then in,
in some sort of a,

2909
02:11:22,880 --> 02:11:23,713
you know,
sort of concerted effort to turn into a 

2910
02:11:25,041 --> 02:11:28,160
legitimate sport and be accepted by 
athletic commissions.

2911
02:11:28,161 --> 02:11:31,760
It's pretty new,
very new in terms of big time sports.

2912
02:11:31,850 --> 02:11:35,810
It was started in 1993,
so it's just 20 something years old,

2913
02:11:35,840 --> 02:11:36,673
24 years old.
So they wanted to make it look like in 

2914
02:11:39,171 --> 02:11:40,004
the beginning of the first fights that I
saw in [inaudible] 97 when I first 

2915
02:11:41,961 --> 02:11:42,794
started working for the UFC,
there was a lot of bare knuckle 

2916
02:11:44,391 --> 02:11:46,640
fighters.
Guys fought with shoes on.

2917
02:11:47,330 --> 02:11:48,163
They were bare knuckle.
You were allowed to grab people's 

2918
02:11:49,131 --> 02:11:49,964
crotches still.
You rather grab their clothes are 

2919
02:11:51,831 --> 02:11:52,664
Kelly's.
Yeah.

2920
02:11:52,700 --> 02:11:55,180
Not that a little different.
You were,

2921
02:11:55,210 --> 02:11:57,740
you're allowed to do a lot of shit.
You could pull hair for a long time.

2922
02:11:59,030 --> 02:12:01,820
They finally got rid of that.
They got rid of grabbing clothes,

2923
02:12:02,510 --> 02:12:07,010
but you didn't have to have knuckle 
padding on your knuckles back then.

2924
02:12:07,011 --> 02:12:07,844
And the people that were super 
successful realize you could hit people 

2925
02:12:10,401 --> 02:12:12,080
way harder if you have patty on your 
knuckles.

2926
02:12:12,330 --> 02:12:13,163
So Vito Belfort was one of the first 
night he was 19 years old and you enter 

2927
02:12:16,181 --> 02:12:17,960
into the UFC,
UFC 12,

2928
02:12:17,990 --> 02:12:18,823
Dothan,
Alabama in 1997 and just beat the fuck 

2929
02:12:21,111 --> 02:12:25,790
out of everybody with gloves on.
What would it take for them to do a rule

2930
02:12:25,791 --> 02:12:26,624
that said no gloves anymore?
They just have to listen to me and 

2931
02:12:29,121 --> 02:12:30,890
listened to a lot of other martial arts 
fans.

2932
02:12:31,130 --> 02:12:33,440
Some people wouldn't want because they 
think you would get cut more,

2933
02:12:33,620 --> 02:12:34,453
which I think you would.
You would get more superficial tissue 

2934
02:12:36,471 --> 02:12:37,304
damage.
But I think ultimately you'd get less 

2935
02:12:39,081 --> 02:12:41,750
brain damage I think because you can get
him less.

2936
02:12:41,751 --> 02:12:42,680
Yeah,
I think you'd get hit less.

2937
02:12:42,950 --> 02:12:45,110
And especially if you practice 
correctly,

2938
02:12:45,530 --> 02:12:46,640
I think you could,
uh,

2939
02:12:46,700 --> 02:12:47,533
I mean you would still run the risk of 
getting elbowed indeed and kicked and 

2940
02:12:50,421 --> 02:12:52,640
it's not safe by any stretch of the 
imagination.

2941
02:12:52,670 --> 02:12:57,110
Do you think it has to get to a point 
where because I'm so young,

2942
02:12:57,140 --> 02:12:57,973
we're fighters or 60 and they're blowing
their brains out and doing what nfl 

2943
02:13:00,801 --> 02:13:01,970
players are doing?
Anybody would.

2944
02:13:02,030 --> 02:13:02,863
I don't think people would have to know 
or hear about a concussion crisis and 

2945
02:13:05,710 --> 02:13:06,980
mma that much,
but it's real.

2946
02:13:07,160 --> 02:13:09,320
I mean any sort of combat sport you're 
going to have it.

2947
02:13:09,350 --> 02:13:10,183
No,
I mean I know it's there but it's not 

2948
02:13:10,941 --> 02:13:13,490
like in the zeitgeists really at the 
moment it isn't yet,

2949
02:13:13,491 --> 02:13:14,324
but it certainly could be and it 
probably certainly will be when some of 

2950
02:13:16,701 --> 02:13:19,670
the veterans get into their sixties and 
seventies and we start to see them.

2951
02:13:19,670 --> 02:13:20,503
Like,
do you ever see Joe Frazier before he 

2952
02:13:21,321 --> 02:13:24,920
died?
He was on my throat.

2953
02:13:25,150 --> 02:13:28,940
He was on Opie and Anthony Show and he 
was so bad.

2954
02:13:28,941 --> 02:13:29,774
His,
his snoring and his inability was on 

2955
02:13:31,801 --> 02:13:33,540
Howard.
It was like floyd mayweather.

2956
02:13:33,930 --> 02:13:37,090
I don't think he's showing any signs.
Stuttering.

2957
02:13:37,100 --> 02:13:38,010
Maybe just.
Yeah,

2958
02:13:38,040 --> 02:13:39,090
maybe it's just 5:00
AM.

2959
02:13:39,450 --> 02:13:44,450
Five am nervous.
Maybe try and get it together or talking

2960
02:13:46,790 --> 02:13:50,490
to Howard and you know,
probably has zero come left and his body

2961
02:13:51,210 --> 02:13:52,950
was it all night long,
right?

2962
02:13:53,220 --> 02:13:54,630
For sure.
For too much comment.

2963
02:13:54,631 --> 02:13:55,800
His mouth.
What does this.

2964
02:13:56,100 --> 02:13:58,020
They have a Ct.
He tests,

2965
02:13:58,021 --> 02:14:00,980
they think of boston university.
THey found a biomarker.

2966
02:14:00,990 --> 02:14:04,810
they think that can let people know now 
ahead of time before it doesn't interest

2967
02:14:04,980 --> 02:14:05,813
you get your bell rung three times and 
they sort of know that already because 

2968
02:14:08,461 --> 02:14:10,230
it's not.
It varies upon the person.

2969
02:14:10,231 --> 02:14:12,480
Some people are way more durable for 
some reason.

2970
02:14:12,900 --> 02:14:13,733
They don't know why and it could be also
connected what we were talking about 

2971
02:14:15,781 --> 02:14:18,030
before,
the actual shape of the head,

2972
02:14:18,330 --> 02:14:19,920
the thickness of the muscles of the 
neck,

2973
02:14:19,921 --> 02:14:23,490
the ability to keep the head from 
snapping back too much.

2974
02:14:23,580 --> 02:14:26,290
How many times it actually happens,
how good you are.

2975
02:14:26,340 --> 02:14:27,173
Avoiding things and roll.
Like some people get hit and then they 

2976
02:14:29,431 --> 02:14:32,820
learn how to roll with stuff and it 
takes a tremendous amount of impact off.

2977
02:14:32,980 --> 02:14:37,020
So you think what mma fighters are in 
their sixties and seventies and it's not

2978
02:14:37,021 --> 02:14:38,400
looking good.
They might consider.

2979
02:14:39,370 --> 02:14:41,730
I don't think they're going to consider 
it Because I think to the general public

2980
02:14:41,731 --> 02:14:46,731
gloves mean safer gloves mean sport.
Fans of mgma want faith.

2981
02:14:47,340 --> 02:14:50,390
They Um,
or if you got.

2982
02:14:50,510 --> 02:14:53,370
If I would say,
if you're talking about public opinion,

2983
02:14:53,550 --> 02:14:54,383
you're going to have a lot of the people
that aren't really fans that are also 

2984
02:14:57,421 --> 02:14:58,200
going to weigh in.

2985
02:14:58,200 --> 02:14:59,700
Right?
So if you have public opinion,

2986
02:14:59,970 --> 02:15:00,803
should they take the gloves off mma?
There's gonna be a lot of people out 

2987
02:15:02,791 --> 02:15:05,950
there arguing passionately that I had no
idea what they're talking about.

2988
02:15:05,970 --> 02:15:08,820
Gloves me and more dangerous and They 
will say no way.

2989
02:15:08,821 --> 02:15:09,654
It's already barbaric enough.
It's really what we should concentrate 

2990
02:15:12,001 --> 02:15:12,834
on and putting more pads and more safety
procedures and stopping fights quicker 

2991
02:15:15,720 --> 02:15:17,430
and looking out for the safety of these 
athletes.

2992
02:15:17,880 --> 02:15:18,713
but I think much like how pads and 
football probably caused more injuries 

2993
02:15:23,590 --> 02:15:24,423
to players rugby.
I think the same thing should be said 

2994
02:15:27,571 --> 02:15:28,404
about mma.
I think mathematics or logic of like 

2995
02:15:29,910 --> 02:15:30,743
helmets and pads cause injuries.
IT really does because think they 

2996
02:15:33,771 --> 02:15:34,604
present them the.
That's the only thing that it does any 

2997
02:15:36,301 --> 02:15:37,134
different.
It doesn't like if I had to choose 

2998
02:15:38,580 --> 02:15:39,413
between fighting someone with them and 
make gloves and fighting some bare 

2999
02:15:41,101 --> 02:15:43,740
knuckle with a good hand wraps and I'll 
be like,

3000
02:15:43,741 --> 02:15:44,574
yeah,
write me up.

3001
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:47,250
Write me up,
you could just tee off on somebody.

3002
02:15:47,280 --> 02:15:50,310
It's a totally different experience.
If your hands are fragile,

3003
02:15:50,430 --> 02:15:51,263
a lot of times guys will hit each other 
with the palms of the hands instead 

3004
02:15:54,030 --> 02:15:55,200
because you don't want to break your 
hands.

3005
02:15:55,430 --> 02:15:56,263
Get on top of someone.
You could smash their face with a palm 

3006
02:15:57,591 --> 02:15:58,424
of the hardest part of your hand when 
you hit things hard with a poem and it 

3007
02:16:00,601 --> 02:16:01,980
doesn't hurt at all.
Yeah,

3008
02:16:01,981 --> 02:16:02,814
it's a different kind of a bone.
It's a thick bone and it's used to 

3009
02:16:05,521 --> 02:16:08,070
touching and pushing against the hardest
part of your body,

3010
02:16:08,071 --> 02:16:10,650
your elbows,
maybe your knee and your elbow,

3011
02:16:10,670 --> 02:16:13,320
but the real hard.
I mean you break your elbow.

3012
02:16:13,990 --> 02:16:14,823
People break shit all the time.
They break chunks off the bottoms of 

3013
02:16:16,951 --> 02:16:19,830
their elbows from fighting to get.
Yeah.

3014
02:16:19,831 --> 02:16:20,664
I've had friends that have to get 
surgery where they have like floating 

3015
02:16:22,621 --> 02:16:24,570
bone chunks from elbow and people in the
head.

3016
02:16:24,780 --> 02:16:26,640
You can chip off little pieces of your 
elbow.

3017
02:16:26,790 --> 02:16:29,440
That's not great.
Get kicked their pain.

3018
02:16:29,470 --> 02:16:30,010
When you get

3019
02:16:30,010 --> 02:16:31,150
hit,
when you're fighting,

3020
02:16:31,660 --> 02:16:32,493
you feel less pain than you probably 
would in regular life because your 

3021
02:16:34,751 --> 02:16:37,420
adrenaline's through the roof and you're
in this heightened situation,

3022
02:16:37,421 --> 02:16:39,880
But you could definitely tell some,
some shots,

3023
02:16:39,881 --> 02:16:41,800
huRt guys,
shots the legs.

3024
02:16:42,100 --> 02:16:42,933
A lot of times when you get that second 
or third leg kick in the same spot on 

3025
02:16:46,061 --> 02:16:46,894
the legs from a really good lead kicker,
there's like a jolt that goes through 

3026
02:16:49,711 --> 02:16:51,460
your whole body.
It's like,

3027
02:16:52,060 --> 02:16:52,893
um,
the difference between like a leg kick 

3028
02:16:54,371 --> 02:16:55,470
and anything else.
as you're different,

3029
02:16:55,500 --> 02:16:56,333
you're dealing with a giant piece of 
muscle and there's a lot of nerve 

3030
02:16:59,261 --> 02:17:00,094
endings in there.
The outside edge of it is kind of 

3031
02:17:02,230 --> 02:17:03,063
tender,
especially if you're not a person who's 

3032
02:17:04,150 --> 02:17:06,630
used to getting kicked there.
And if someone like a,

3033
02:17:06,780 --> 02:17:07,613
you know,
like a maurice smith or an anesto nesto 

3034
02:17:09,401 --> 02:17:13,360
who's like a world champion,
kickboxer slams a shin into there.

3035
02:17:13,361 --> 02:17:15,580
It is extraordinarily painful

3036
02:17:15,610 --> 02:17:19,230
because I remember that girl that got 
her arm bitten off by a shark.

3037
02:17:19,500 --> 02:17:23,370
Bethany a,
someone she said that when she heard the

3038
02:17:23,371 --> 02:17:25,980
sound of she heard it,
the crunch,

3039
02:17:26,010 --> 02:17:27,480
but she felt no pain.
In fact,

3040
02:17:27,481 --> 02:17:28,314
she said it felt like blissful orgasmic 
because so much dope men goes to the 

3041
02:17:31,111 --> 02:17:34,090
area so that you don't give up.
Oh my god.

3042
02:17:34,100 --> 02:17:34,933
So I just curious if in like fight or 
flight mode fighting if you're even 

3043
02:17:37,861 --> 02:17:39,660
feeling this stuff.
Yeah,

3044
02:17:39,661 --> 02:17:41,670
you feel it.
You feel some stuff more than others.

3045
02:17:41,700 --> 02:17:43,440
Just like kicking in.
As soon as the fight's over you're like,

3046
02:17:43,441 --> 02:17:46,110
oh fuck,
I'm so much pain after a fight.

3047
02:17:46,111 --> 02:17:48,450
You,
you're in severe pain for sure.

3048
02:17:48,500 --> 02:17:49,333
Just after your whole body's bruised up.
It's been a long time since I've felt 

3049
02:17:53,521 --> 02:17:55,800
that,
but I definitely remember after fights.

3050
02:17:55,950 --> 02:17:59,100
What's the most painful place to be hit 
the head for sure.

3051
02:17:59,430 --> 02:18:00,263
The body too though,
you know your body can hurt for days 

3052
02:18:02,281 --> 02:18:04,650
afterwards if you get hit with like a 
left hook to the liver,

3053
02:18:04,651 --> 02:18:07,740
like a really hard left hook to the body
is tearing the achilles heel.

3054
02:18:07,741 --> 02:18:11,070
Really the most painful injury there has
done a really bad one though,

3055
02:18:11,071 --> 02:18:13,770
but I think injured discs are pretty 
goddamn bad.

3056
02:18:14,730 --> 02:18:15,563
Injured disc sleeve,
a lot of people with a atrophied arms 

3057
02:18:18,451 --> 02:18:21,230
and pushes on nerves and jen

3058
02:18:21,760 --> 02:18:25,370
nerves,
impingements impinges on the signal.

3059
02:18:25,450 --> 02:18:26,283
So working your muscles literally 
atrophy and shrink up and if you don't 

3060
02:18:29,211 --> 02:18:33,470
act on it really quickly,
it's a really common thing with men,

3061
02:18:33,950 --> 02:18:34,641
um,
that,

3062
02:18:34,641 --> 02:18:35,474
uh,
either lift a lot of weights or do it 

3063
02:18:37,041 --> 02:18:39,100
incorrectly and fuck their back.

3064
02:18:39,380 --> 02:18:40,213
But are we all sleepIng wrong and 
sitting wrong and just doing everything 

3065
02:18:42,091 --> 02:18:44,280
wrong.
There's definitely sitting wrong.

3066
02:18:44,340 --> 02:18:46,830
Yeah.
I feel like I'm in the sybian right now.

3067
02:18:46,920 --> 02:18:47,990
This thing's awesome.
Well,

3068
02:18:47,991 --> 02:18:49,000
yeah.
This is this.

3069
02:18:49,030 --> 02:18:51,740
I'm always supposed to be sitting 
because we're sending ron wrong,

3070
02:18:52,080 --> 02:18:53,540
straight up,
sleeping run.

3071
02:18:53,700 --> 02:18:55,770
Just sleep.
But do you sleep on your side?

3072
02:18:56,610 --> 02:18:58,620
Do you put a pillow between your knees?
Sometimes?

3073
02:18:58,930 --> 02:19:00,720
Yeah.
Are we all Supposed to do that?

3074
02:19:01,230 --> 02:19:02,530
We're also shooting,
right?

3075
02:19:02,860 --> 02:19:04,080
Uh,
I should write.

3076
02:19:05,030 --> 02:19:05,863
Got a squatty potty.
Got one of those phases in your 

3077
02:19:09,620 --> 02:19:10,700
backyard?
Yeah.

3078
02:19:10,740 --> 02:19:11,573
I have one of those two and people come 
into my house and they think they're 

3079
02:19:13,081 --> 02:19:14,510
like,
does a handicap person live here?

3080
02:19:14,520 --> 02:19:15,420
I'm like,
just calm down.

3081
02:19:15,421 --> 02:19:18,540
We're all shitting wrong.
It's easier to shoot that way.

3082
02:19:18,870 --> 02:19:20,220
Squatty potties.
Primarily women.

3083
02:19:20,221 --> 02:19:21,054
We don't empty our bladders completely 
when we use regular toilets and that's 

3084
02:19:23,791 --> 02:19:27,440
why we have to pee all the time because 
we have to use squatty potties when we p

3085
02:19:27,441 --> 02:19:28,270
also.

3086
02:19:28,270 --> 02:19:29,103
Yeah,
we don't empty our entire bladders 

3087
02:19:30,020 --> 02:19:33,050
toilets are not designed for our 
uteruses.

3088
02:19:33,080 --> 02:19:35,410
Basically uti as a plural,
as uti.

3089
02:19:35,430 --> 02:19:36,620
I don't know,
but yeah,

3090
02:19:36,650 --> 02:19:39,200
that's why women always have to be.
But you can piece it in.

3091
02:19:39,210 --> 02:19:39,921
Yup.
No problem.

3092
02:19:39,921 --> 02:19:40,940
Right?
No.

3093
02:19:41,080 --> 02:19:42,410
Yeah.
It just goes all over the place.

3094
02:19:42,411 --> 02:19:44,210
But because they got a mess.
Right?

3095
02:19:44,211 --> 02:19:45,530
But in the shower,
right?

3096
02:19:45,790 --> 02:19:48,050
I don't do that.
It's just being in the shower only.

3097
02:19:48,230 --> 02:19:50,200
What seems like it'd be a real clean way
to do it.

3098
02:19:50,201 --> 02:19:55,201
It's a great way to stay single forever.
Am I going to be like,

3099
02:19:55,980 --> 02:20:00,500
hey,
would you be down with a woman peeing in

3100
02:20:00,501 --> 02:20:02,060
the shower if you were in there with 
her?

3101
02:20:02,150 --> 02:20:05,180
I don't give a fuck dated.
A lot of guys will be in the shower.

3102
02:20:05,410 --> 02:20:08,570
I pee in the shower all the time.
Is it just like I have to pee and I'm in

3103
02:20:08,571 --> 02:20:08,970
the shower.

3104
02:20:08,970 --> 02:20:09,803
What?
I give a fuck.

3105
02:20:10,400 --> 02:20:12,230
I've had guys pee while I'm in the 
shower with that.

3106
02:20:12,231 --> 02:20:14,300
It's like you're peeing on my foot 
bottom.

3107
02:20:14,330 --> 02:20:16,820
WhaT's on my body is grosser than what's
coming out of my dick.

3108
02:20:16,870 --> 02:20:17,703
She really true.
Is that why are we so grossed out by p 

3109
02:20:20,180 --> 02:20:21,470
two?
Is that socially constructed?

3110
02:20:21,620 --> 02:20:23,670
Like why is this so disgusting?
It's gross.

3111
02:20:24,380 --> 02:20:29,380
A nine year old pulls it out.
I know I've seen you out,

3112
02:20:29,780 --> 02:20:32,480
but this is weird.
What is that?

3113
02:20:33,530 --> 02:20:36,050
Conditioning?
It's probably conditioning.

3114
02:20:36,051 --> 02:20:36,884
Yeah.
It doesn't seem like there's a 

3115
02:20:37,040 --> 02:20:39,170
renovation.
Scratching your ear if you're scratching

3116
02:20:39,171 --> 02:20:40,230
your eye.
If you reach it,

3117
02:20:40,290 --> 02:20:41,440
what do you pick up?
Food.

3118
02:20:42,220 --> 02:20:43,053
But this is gross,
but I don't even have any boogers in 

3119
02:20:45,261 --> 02:20:46,220
here.
It's a good question.

3120
02:20:46,700 --> 02:20:47,720
I don't know.
Tell me.

3121
02:20:48,200 --> 02:20:50,870
I really wish I knew.
I guess it's like a shame thing from the

3122
02:20:50,871 --> 02:20:52,850
time you were little,
you got a booger in your nose.

3123
02:20:53,270 --> 02:20:54,330
That's true.
That's true,

3124
02:20:54,750 --> 02:20:56,210
mike.
He eats his bugger.

3125
02:20:56,880 --> 02:20:57,713
This is my face.
All my fits like I have a blood hold on 

3126
02:20:59,181 --> 02:21:04,181
my face.
Like why is this is gross crumps,

3127
02:21:04,970 --> 02:21:07,670
but why is it so satisfying when you 
pick out a giant,

3128
02:21:08,960 --> 02:21:11,420
a giant winter burger and you're like,
whoa,

3129
02:21:11,421 --> 02:21:12,254
look at this goddamn thing.
I started getting my nose waxed hall 

3130
02:21:15,771 --> 02:21:16,604
inside of my.

3131
02:21:18,800 --> 02:21:22,070
This is what happened in the second of 
the pocket and they just started meeting

3132
02:21:22,071 --> 02:21:22,904
things.
I should never tell anyone that it's 

3133
02:21:25,670 --> 02:21:26,920
always have.
It's on the job.

3134
02:21:27,140 --> 02:21:27,973
No,
because you have little hairs and 

3135
02:21:28,671 --> 02:21:30,830
they're just like unattractive.
So I started waxing them.

3136
02:21:31,010 --> 02:21:32,510
That's a good move.
It hurts.

3137
02:21:33,370 --> 02:21:36,740
I stick a little,
but why you guys having those hairs?

3138
02:21:36,741 --> 02:21:38,870
Fine.
Girls having good success gets itchy.

3139
02:21:39,570 --> 02:21:40,403
Boogers get stuck in it.
I cleaned it out just like a blow my 

3140
02:21:42,351 --> 02:21:43,760
nose because then you get.
Yeah,

3141
02:21:43,761 --> 02:21:47,080
the boogers get all but we're supposed 
to have knows harris needs more.

3142
02:21:47,090 --> 02:21:48,590
I just sneezed.
If you're running,

3143
02:21:48,591 --> 02:21:50,090
do you ever run?
I do.

3144
02:21:50,091 --> 02:21:52,670
Okay.
When you run to emotional rocket,

3145
02:21:52,940 --> 02:21:55,670
do you put a finger on one nostril like 
that?

3146
02:21:55,680 --> 02:22:00,680
Golf club?
Not only when I'm running,

3147
02:22:00,891 --> 02:22:01,724
why would numb running because it's a 
good thing to do in the middle of 

3148
02:22:03,981 --> 02:22:08,580
running outside.
Yes.

3149
02:22:08,690 --> 02:22:09,700
Yeah.
Yeah.

3150
02:22:10,070 --> 02:22:12,080
I'm trying to start running inside 
barefoot.

3151
02:22:12,500 --> 02:22:13,333
Like those socks you sent me a 
ridiculous because here's the thing 

3152
02:22:16,761 --> 02:22:19,880
about those socks and I feel it with 
those five fingers known.

3153
02:22:19,881 --> 02:22:20,750
I don't even know.
Yeah,

3154
02:22:20,780 --> 02:22:22,250
I've heard of him.
the steel socks.

3155
02:22:23,090 --> 02:22:26,090
Dyneema.
Dyneema is the same stuff they used

3156
02:22:26,090 --> 02:22:27,980
to make bows drinks.
Oh really?

3157
02:22:27,990 --> 02:22:28,501
Use it.
Yeah,

3158
02:22:28,501 --> 02:22:29,334
because it's incredibly strong.
I mean you think about it a bow you're 

3159
02:22:31,501 --> 02:22:32,334
pulling back like at a really heavy book
and go like 80 pounds of pressure to 

3160
02:22:35,491 --> 02:22:36,324
pull it back.
And so you have all this force on those 

3161
02:22:38,790 --> 02:22:39,623
very thin wire that's like a shoestring 
thinner even in fact that's how strong 

3162
02:22:44,341 --> 02:22:45,174
dyneema is.
So they make these shoes out of dyneema 

3163
02:22:47,761 --> 02:22:49,660
and you can run on things.
Well,

3164
02:22:49,730 --> 02:22:51,220
I'm getting a date.
That's it.

3165
02:22:52,180 --> 02:22:55,320
I'm trying to be barefoot outside.
Thirty minutes a day.

3166
02:22:55,480 --> 02:22:57,480
It's a good move.
Is this a dyneema?

3167
02:22:57,510 --> 02:22:58,021
No.
Well,

3168
02:22:58,021 --> 02:22:59,910
today I kept.
I did kick boxing,

3169
02:22:59,911 --> 02:23:00,744
which I always do barefoot,
so I got my a lot of barefoot moving in 

3170
02:23:04,020 --> 02:23:06,750
and I also do it on a fairly soft 
surface,

3171
02:23:06,751 --> 02:23:10,500
which is great because your feet really 
get to dig in your toes.

3172
02:23:12,950 --> 02:23:14,570
Electrons from the earth.
That's it.

3173
02:23:14,571 --> 02:23:15,940
It's deep dyneema.
Jamie.

3174
02:23:15,960 --> 02:23:17,530
Yeah.
I got these myself too.

3175
02:23:18,080 --> 02:23:21,320
It felt like just putting on a garden 
gloves on your feet,

3176
02:23:21,470 --> 02:23:22,303
but can you walk on.
I walked outside of my little parking 

3177
02:23:25,371 --> 02:23:26,380
lot and I was like,
nah,

3178
02:23:26,660 --> 02:23:27,493
it's phillip felt better barefoot like 
glass was going to go right through my 

3179
02:23:29,811 --> 02:23:31,020
foot.
I wouldn't.

3180
02:23:31,340 --> 02:23:32,900
I wouldn't have done.
I wouldn't have run anywhere,

3181
02:23:32,950 --> 02:23:37,200
but I won't go through it.
I wasn't going to test it.

3182
02:23:37,380 --> 02:23:39,250
They felt they didn't feel like,
come on bro.

3183
02:23:39,840 --> 02:23:42,000
This is supposed to be like sneakers 
there.

3184
02:23:42,130 --> 02:23:44,120
I didn't.
I didn't buy the advertising,

3185
02:23:45,230 --> 02:23:49,850
but well here's 80 bucks.

3186
02:23:50,640 --> 02:23:54,730
Boasts strings cut all the time.
Accidentally this bow strings or they're

3187
02:23:54,731 --> 02:23:56,500
not.
It's not an invulnerable.

3188
02:23:56,501 --> 02:23:57,790
In fact,
when I was in Hawaii,

3189
02:23:57,820 --> 02:24:01,210
I accidentally cut one of my bow strings
with the broadhead from the arrow.

3190
02:24:01,211 --> 02:24:03,010
Just touched it and I didn't even know 
what happened.

3191
02:24:04,160 --> 02:24:08,740
It's not good.
So that stuff for fishing line,

3192
02:24:09,590 --> 02:24:12,730
some sort of a synthetic line.
I don't know how exactly they make it.

3193
02:24:13,030 --> 02:24:13,863
I think it's got to be different,
but there's a bunch of different kinds 

3194
02:24:15,191 --> 02:24:17,950
of fishing line too.
They have braided fishing line.

3195
02:24:18,040 --> 02:24:21,520
that's like the most common stuff that 
they use today.

3196
02:24:21,521 --> 02:24:22,091
Yeah.
Yeah.

3197
02:24:22,091 --> 02:24:25,630
Fish were mostly.
No,

3198
02:24:25,631 --> 02:24:26,464
mostly salt,
water fly fishing boat fishing in the 

3199
02:24:30,431 --> 02:24:31,264
ocean.
It's great to catch fish and then you 

3200
02:24:32,500 --> 02:24:36,400
bring it like if you stay in a 
restaurant or a hotel on mercury,

3201
02:24:36,770 --> 02:24:37,603
mercury,
we can definitely get some mercury in 

3202
02:24:39,911 --> 02:24:42,810
your body if you eat a lot of salmon or 
if you love tuna rather.

3203
02:24:42,930 --> 02:24:43,763
They're supposed to,
but they just say don't eat it all the 

3204
02:24:46,991 --> 02:24:48,470
time every day,
you know,

3205
02:24:48,540 --> 02:24:51,100
but with the amount of heavy metals that
are in the ocean,

3206
02:24:51,101 --> 02:24:51,934
you're definitely going to get some.
I don't know how much of it they're 

3207
02:24:53,261 --> 02:24:55,340
actually testing though,
like have you ever been?

3208
02:24:55,600 --> 02:24:58,100
I'd get my blood tested.
I've never shown it.

3209
02:24:58,101 --> 02:25:02,830
I did at one point in time I was eating 
a lot of sardines and it tested positive

3210
02:25:02,831 --> 02:25:06,660
for arsenic and the doctors,
I don't know,

3211
02:25:06,700 --> 02:25:09,130
it was a very tiny amount.
The doctor was like,

3212
02:25:09,160 --> 02:25:11,320
hmm,
what do like go through your diet?

3213
02:25:11,350 --> 02:25:12,850
And I,
as soon as I hit sardines,

3214
02:25:12,880 --> 02:25:13,661
he goes,
how often you eat?

3215
02:25:13,661 --> 02:25:15,460
I go,
I eat like two cans a day.

3216
02:25:15,690 --> 02:25:17,260
Just like what?
And he's like,

3217
02:25:17,261 --> 02:25:18,050
yeah,
that's it.

3218
02:25:18,050 --> 02:25:19,060
I think he was,
yeah,

3219
02:25:19,240 --> 02:25:22,000
they live in very polluted areas often 
and they're at the bottom.

3220
02:25:23,260 --> 02:25:24,010
They collect some of

3221
02:25:24,010 --> 02:25:25,630
the heavy metals that comes from our 
polluted.

3222
02:25:26,770 --> 02:25:28,990
How often?
Not every day,

3223
02:25:28,991 --> 02:25:31,030
not two cans a day,
but I eat it can last night.

3224
02:25:31,720 --> 02:25:33,430
What is it?
Why do you have to do in canned?

3225
02:25:33,910 --> 02:25:36,220
Because you don't.
If you could eat them fresh for sure.

3226
02:25:36,240 --> 02:25:37,073
Yeah.
They're just a good source of healthy 

3227
02:25:38,201 --> 02:25:40,180
fats and there can.
Cause they can't have an olive oil.

3228
02:25:40,210 --> 02:25:43,000
Yeah.
But it's a good,

3229
02:25:43,001 --> 02:25:47,710
a high fat thing to eat for me.
Well,

3230
02:25:47,711 --> 02:25:48,400
um,
yeah,

3231
02:25:48,400 --> 02:25:50,200
they're not that bad.
I like this.

3232
02:25:50,220 --> 02:25:51,053
We were talking about this earlier,
this whole thing of everything has to 

3233
02:25:52,151 --> 02:25:55,560
taste good.
Like doesn't cave shake that clicks.

3234
02:25:55,620 --> 02:25:57,210
There's this thing where it's like 
everything has to taste good.

3235
02:25:57,220 --> 02:25:57,521
I'm like,
no,

3236
02:25:57,521 --> 02:25:58,354
they don't.
Everything that tastes good is fucking 

3237
02:25:58,691 --> 02:25:59,524
terrible for you.
Sometimes things that taste good or 

3238
02:26:00,611 --> 02:26:03,550
great for you,
like a juicy steak.

3239
02:26:03,700 --> 02:26:04,330
Well tHat's true.

3240
02:26:04,330 --> 02:26:05,163
That's a good thing.
There's things that are good for you 

3241
02:26:06,581 --> 02:26:07,510
that tastes good.
Beets.

3242
02:26:07,511 --> 02:26:09,740
Beets tastes delicious.
I'm a big fan of beets.

3243
02:26:09,741 --> 02:26:11,590
Love beets.
They're super good for you.

3244
02:26:11,620 --> 02:26:13,750
Yeah,
so like there's lot of stuff that tastes

3245
02:26:13,751 --> 02:26:15,240
good.
That's good for.

3246
02:26:15,340 --> 02:26:16,930
I'm trying to figure out what to eat.
I just don't know what to eat.

3247
02:26:17,320 --> 02:26:18,730
I'm going to start eating whatever you 
posted on it.

3248
02:26:18,731 --> 02:26:20,430
Don't get it.
Don't get another eating disorder.

3249
02:26:20,640 --> 02:26:22,990
No,
I'm now my eating disorder is I only eat

3250
02:26:22,991 --> 02:26:25,330
shed that you post.
I bought all this cave shakes.

3251
02:26:25,331 --> 02:26:27,880
I'm only eating those cave shakes now.
Why have meat for you?

3252
02:26:27,881 --> 02:26:32,881
I go elk for you.
Had to say thank you kelly.

3253
02:26:33,840 --> 02:26:36,890
Fuck you.
I got me for you.

3254
02:26:37,480 --> 02:26:41,550
Don't you take a shit on my.
Wait.

3255
02:26:41,670 --> 02:26:43,360
Are you a good singer?
No.

3256
02:26:43,710 --> 02:26:44,870
Are you sure?
Definitely.

3257
02:26:44,950 --> 02:26:45,790
One hundred percent.
I don't know.

3258
02:26:45,791 --> 02:26:48,620
I think that your job is actually pretty
amazing.

3259
02:26:48,850 --> 02:26:52,900
Our kelly,
if I wanted to go on tours are nobody's.

3260
02:26:55,720 --> 02:26:58,720
They can do things with their voice.
Like I can only make noises.

3261
02:26:58,750 --> 02:27:00,790
It's a muscle ultimately,
isn't it?

3262
02:27:01,120 --> 02:27:03,310
I think is a sound that you're capable 
of making,

3263
02:27:03,311 --> 02:27:05,140
right?
There's like impressions.

3264
02:27:05,320 --> 02:27:09,220
I can do impressions of some people and 
I know when I could do them.

3265
02:27:09,610 --> 02:27:11,540
Are they in your same register?
Yeah.

3266
02:27:11,950 --> 02:27:13,090
Good.
Sam kinison oppression.

3267
02:27:13,120 --> 02:27:14,200
yeah.
Maybe I can do that.

3268
02:27:14,201 --> 02:27:17,050
If I could listen to them in particular 
can do it.

3269
02:27:17,051 --> 02:27:19,570
Then you could just got to get into it.
I cAn do a Mike Tyson.

3270
02:27:19,571 --> 02:27:20,404
I can do a few of them,
but then there's other ones that I hear 

3271
02:27:21,911 --> 02:27:23,050
and I go,
I can't do that one.

3272
02:27:23,500 --> 02:27:25,530
Apparently people are good at 
impressions are good at singing.

3273
02:27:25,780 --> 02:27:27,070
It's the same part of your brain,
right?

3274
02:27:27,350 --> 02:27:29,590
Like you hear something and can 
replicate it.

3275
02:27:29,620 --> 02:27:32,740
It's about hearing not about replicating
or something.

3276
02:27:32,920 --> 02:27:34,870
Well,
it's singing is a weird thing,

3277
02:27:34,871 --> 02:27:35,704
right?
Because it's mariah carey style singing 

3278
02:27:37,420 --> 02:27:40,230
and then there's amy winehouse saying.
Right.

3279
02:27:40,330 --> 02:27:42,290
And I liked both of them.
You know,

3280
02:27:42,291 --> 02:27:46,600
like it's a very big say I did not see 
this coming.

3281
02:27:47,090 --> 02:27:47,923
I say the difference like mariah carey,
I wouldn't say she's known for 

3282
02:27:51,080 --> 02:27:55,940
songwriting,
whereas amy wants different artists,

3283
02:27:55,960 --> 02:27:57,640
but like that fantasy song.

3284
02:27:59,760 --> 02:28:02,380
Great song.
The one with busta rhymes on it.

3285
02:28:02,381 --> 02:28:02,891
Sweet.
Yeah.

3286
02:28:02,891 --> 02:28:04,570
That one,
believe you just said that.

3287
02:28:04,571 --> 02:28:07,060
Me and mariah,
back leg babies.

3288
02:28:07,061 --> 02:28:09,750
I listened to that.
That's like my go to song.

3289
02:28:10,670 --> 02:28:11,630
Is it old?
Dirty bastard?

3290
02:28:13,570 --> 02:28:14,800
Oh god.
I'm so racist.

3291
02:28:15,960 --> 02:28:20,350
Sorry.
ShouLd not have smoke weed today.

3292
02:28:20,440 --> 02:28:22,490
Conflating black rappers with deep 
voices.

3293
02:28:22,550 --> 02:28:23,990
Oopsies.
I'm not even joking.

3294
02:28:23,991 --> 02:28:25,970
That's like my go to song and put me in 
a good mood.

3295
02:28:26,090 --> 02:28:27,810
Good song.
It's a great song.

3296
02:28:28,250 --> 02:28:31,250
Which is also weird.
She's got a beautiful voice.

3297
02:28:31,610 --> 02:28:33,980
They can.
Hero makes me cry every time.

3298
02:28:34,040 --> 02:28:34,873
But I also looked like liz fares voice,
which is all like talking through songs 

3299
02:28:38,220 --> 02:28:40,640
and I do love me some.
Oh shit.

3300
02:28:40,790 --> 02:28:42,800
Oh yeah.
Mariah carey.

3301
02:28:43,190 --> 02:28:45,320
She's like lost it.
Right.

3302
02:28:46,580 --> 02:28:47,600
Listen,
we all lose.

3303
02:28:48,520 --> 02:28:52,190
Can you put out on the podcast how 
famous you get if you get that famous,

3304
02:28:52,310 --> 02:28:53,150
good luck.

3305
02:28:53,240 --> 02:28:57,410
Do you remember her in that field of 
corn with those?

3306
02:28:57,580 --> 02:29:00,800
She booty shorts on.
I mean that was the first song,

3307
02:29:01,010 --> 02:29:03,750
right?
That was our first big hit pigtails.

3308
02:29:04,340 --> 02:29:09,340
It was like jesus louisa's and she was 
dating some record executive right now.

3309
02:29:09,900 --> 02:29:10,970
Jimmy ivy.
Who was it?

3310
02:29:12,730 --> 02:29:17,730
You just know everything.
Don't you know who is Jennifer Lopez?

3311
02:29:19,970 --> 02:29:24,970
First husband before puff daddy.
I don't think they were married before.

3312
02:29:25,670 --> 02:29:29,370
Antonio.
Antonio banderas did ben.

3313
02:29:29,590 --> 02:29:30,770
What's his name?
Ben affleck.

3314
02:29:30,771 --> 02:29:32,720
Did he dodged the bullet or he didn't 
get married?

3315
02:29:32,721 --> 02:29:34,070
They didn't get married.
They did some.

3316
02:29:34,100 --> 02:29:37,000
They did some music videos together.
Marc anthony was very true,

3317
02:29:37,001 --> 02:29:40,070
but I don't know about before she was 
married to some guy who's a sued.

3318
02:29:40,610 --> 02:29:42,370
Where you going to try everybody dodging
her.

3319
02:29:42,470 --> 02:29:45,170
He ain't gone crazy.
lopez leg.

3320
02:29:45,470 --> 02:29:47,760
Remember when ben affleck was in a music
video with her?

3321
02:29:48,710 --> 02:29:51,680
Chris died.
That's her story.

3322
02:29:51,681 --> 02:29:53,110
That I hope is true.
It

3323
02:29:53,220 --> 02:29:54,053
someone told me that they were told by a
construction guy that Jennifer Lopez 

3324
02:29:58,201 --> 02:29:59,034
called them and told them to take then 
affleck's basketball court that he has 

3325
02:30:03,601 --> 02:30:07,740
and move it to her house and they were 
like,

3326
02:30:07,741 --> 02:30:09,450
what?
And she was like,

3327
02:30:09,480 --> 02:30:11,730
I want to surprise him.
I want to move.

3328
02:30:11,760 --> 02:30:15,550
I want to move his basketball court.
She did.

3329
02:30:15,570 --> 02:30:19,230
She wanted them to literally build a 
basketball court in her.

3330
02:30:19,260 --> 02:30:22,710
Like I'm sure palatial estate that is 
his.

3331
02:30:22,740 --> 02:30:23,573
He has an indoor basketball court.
She wanted them to recreate it at her 

3332
02:30:26,221 --> 02:30:27,054
place,
take it board by board and move it to 

3333
02:30:29,191 --> 02:30:30,750
her place.
Now if that is true,

3334
02:30:30,840 --> 02:30:31,673
and it may not be,
it might just be bullshit that somebody 

3335
02:30:32,821 --> 02:30:34,680
told me,
but I loved it.

3336
02:30:35,040 --> 02:30:36,000
I loved it.
I'm like,

3337
02:30:36,080 --> 02:30:40,170
oh that girl,
like how hard does she squeeze?

3338
02:30:40,330 --> 02:30:41,430
I mean,
do you know what I'm saying?

3339
02:30:41,610 --> 02:30:43,850
I mean,
what kind of for roche,

3340
02:30:46,470 --> 02:30:49,380
everything.
Everything emotionally,

3341
02:30:49,381 --> 02:30:51,750
sexually,
how hard does she pull it in?

3342
02:30:51,930 --> 02:30:56,730
How much control does she clamped down 
that she thought it would be a good move

3343
02:30:56,731 --> 02:30:59,750
to move his entire basketball court?
I

3344
02:30:59,990 --> 02:31:02,580
like it when women throw money around 
and give gifts,

3345
02:31:02,750 --> 02:31:05,960
women's stealing your basketball court 
and putting it into your house.

3346
02:31:06,170 --> 02:31:09,800
That's a crazy person's move.
Make him happy.

3347
02:31:10,290 --> 02:31:13,010
That make you happy when someone steals 
your basketball court because you get to

3348
02:31:13,011 --> 02:31:16,640
now play basketball at my house.
Isn't that the whole point?

3349
02:31:17,340 --> 02:31:18,290
He's like,
I wouldn't do it.

3350
02:31:20,190 --> 02:31:22,360
Boyfriend has a tennis court.
I don't like where it is.

3351
02:31:23,020 --> 02:31:23,853
I needed to be closer to me.
I'm not going to drive down to your and 

3352
02:31:26,191 --> 02:31:30,210
bullshit and we are together forever.
I'm convinced.

3353
02:31:30,300 --> 02:31:35,300
Are you okay then let me make this 
fucking call her joys.

3354
02:31:39,960 --> 02:31:41,960
I think it sounds like an awesome 
solution.

3355
02:31:42,420 --> 02:31:45,510
frustrating problem.
I'm not going to drive over to ogden and

3356
02:31:45,511 --> 02:31:47,340
sunset.
If you come to me,

3357
02:31:47,341 --> 02:31:48,710
you come to calabasas,
right?

3358
02:31:48,900 --> 02:31:50,700
I understand what you're saying.
I understand what you're saying.

3359
02:31:51,030 --> 02:31:51,863
Well,
it's like,

3360
02:31:52,060 --> 02:31:53,390
well,
you're fighting about it.

3361
02:31:53,391 --> 02:31:54,500
He's like,
I want to go play basketball.

3362
02:31:54,501 --> 02:31:55,430
And she's like,
but I need you here.

3363
02:31:55,431 --> 02:31:56,900
And he's like,
well my basketball courts over there.

3364
02:31:56,901 --> 02:31:57,850
And she was like,
now what?

3365
02:31:59,880 --> 02:32:02,460
I respect that now.
What the fuck?

3366
02:32:02,461 --> 02:32:05,500
You fuck you,
your basketball courts right now.

3367
02:32:07,080 --> 02:32:08,340
I'm going to go play baSketball,
my boys.

3368
02:32:08,370 --> 02:32:09,181
oh,
that's interesting.

3369
02:32:09,181 --> 02:32:11,250
The basketball courts here now.
What's your excuse now?

3370
02:32:11,251 --> 02:32:12,084
Where you going?

3371
02:32:12,560 --> 02:32:13,500
That's like,
that's like a.

3372
02:32:13,501 --> 02:32:14,820
Let me smell your deck mode.
Right?

3373
02:32:14,880 --> 02:32:15,713
They put like a,
like a little balcony where she could 

3374
02:32:18,451 --> 02:32:20,730
like watch over the basketball at all 
times.

3375
02:32:21,110 --> 02:32:22,980
Like some princess in a castle

3376
02:32:23,020 --> 02:32:23,853
and I would like,
I would like put all these like shaming 

3377
02:32:25,061 --> 02:32:27,130
devices in like every time you miss a 
basket,

3378
02:32:27,370 --> 02:32:30,370
the whole court reverberates with a fart
noise

3379
02:32:30,450 --> 02:32:35,450
has to just to emasculate him as much as
possible.

3380
02:32:38,730 --> 02:32:41,100
But if she just sat there just cross out
like reading a book.

3381
02:32:41,200 --> 02:32:42,033
Like this is where I like to read.
I like to read to the sound of you guys 

3382
02:32:43,951 --> 02:32:47,010
playing basketball.
No one can talk any crazy shit,

3383
02:32:47,570 --> 02:32:48,181
dude.
Dude.

3384
02:32:48,181 --> 02:32:49,020
Dude,
listen to me.

3385
02:32:49,110 --> 02:32:51,750
Do guys like expensive?
Gets donk,

3386
02:32:51,850 --> 02:32:52,683
donk,
donk,

3387
02:32:53,010 --> 02:32:53,780
donk,
get married.

3388
02:32:53,780 --> 02:32:56,130
It just don't do it.
how am I going to not do it bro?

3389
02:32:56,131 --> 02:32:56,964
She moved the basketball court.
I mean what the fuck did didn't get 

3390
02:32:59,131 --> 02:33:00,130
married?
No.

3391
02:33:00,380 --> 02:33:02,160
so it either didn't work or it didn't 
happen.

3392
02:33:02,450 --> 02:33:04,740
Imagine this story is true by the way,
right?

3393
02:33:04,741 --> 02:33:07,170
I don't even know the story's true.
Let's assume it's not true,

3394
02:33:07,260 --> 02:33:08,093
but let's just for fiction,
let's create this true story that she 

3395
02:33:10,801 --> 02:33:11,634
did move the basketball court and here 
poor ben is was few actor buddies that 

3396
02:33:15,811 --> 02:33:16,740
are hanging out with him.
Like,

3397
02:33:16,741 --> 02:33:17,970
dude,
you can't do this.

3398
02:33:17,971 --> 02:33:19,440
You can't do this.
Here's what it is.

3399
02:33:19,620 --> 02:33:23,160
My nightmare is the guy I'm with going 
out on a boys' night.

3400
02:33:23,470 --> 02:33:24,960
I'm going to go play basketball with my 
boys.

3401
02:33:24,961 --> 02:33:27,570
Digney meaning if the basketball courts 
here,

3402
02:33:27,571 --> 02:33:30,000
I know what you're doing.
I'm in control of your shit.

3403
02:33:30,060 --> 02:33:32,310
You're not secretly going to jumbos 
clown room.

3404
02:33:32,580 --> 02:33:33,413
I can control the.

3405
02:33:33,880 --> 02:33:36,890
You treat the boy the same way you pre 
treat a dog.

3406
02:33:36,891 --> 02:33:37,970
Like when you look in his eyes.

3407
02:33:39,110 --> 02:33:39,943
I just looked at them.
I just give them raw meat and marrow 

3408
02:33:42,021 --> 02:33:43,670
bones and they're not allowed on the 
couch.

3409
02:33:44,020 --> 02:33:46,280
Like I fuck them looking at me.
Now.

3410
02:33:46,281 --> 02:33:47,114
I'm very beta in my relationships,
but something I do wonder is apparently 

3411
02:33:50,390 --> 02:33:51,223
giving his masculine.
And I'm always curious if guys like 

3412
02:33:54,291 --> 02:33:58,070
expensive gifts or if they don't.
I don't have an opinion.

3413
02:33:58,160 --> 02:33:58,993
We're dating.
I'm getting you a watch or you were 

3414
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:04,410
rich.
so I wouldn't know.

3415
02:34:04,420 --> 02:34:08,300
I'm not because I buy guys watches.
I would say that's very sweet.

3416
02:34:08,301 --> 02:34:10,250
That's the nice thing about.
damn,

3417
02:34:10,251 --> 02:34:12,300
I gotta buy this pitch something now.
Yeah,

3418
02:34:12,890 --> 02:34:13,840
I would think that.
Yeah.

3419
02:34:14,610 --> 02:34:18,010
I don't want to feel like I don't want 
to feel like keeping

3420
02:34:18,070 --> 02:34:19,990
right.
But if I get you a,

3421
02:34:20,170 --> 02:34:24,310
I don't know,
fucking another salt lamp or whatever.

3422
02:34:24,311 --> 02:34:26,530
That's not a strong.
So salt lamp.

3423
02:34:26,620 --> 02:34:30,370
if I get you something fancy or pay for 
a trip or something,

3424
02:34:30,371 --> 02:34:33,010
do you like it or do you feel like 
gross?

3425
02:34:33,110 --> 02:34:37,600
I think ideally this is,
it sounds like shit,

3426
02:34:37,601 --> 02:34:39,340
but I'm being honest.
I think ideally,

3427
02:34:40,360 --> 02:34:43,330
especially in the situation where it's 
someone like you has a lot of money.

3428
02:34:43,590 --> 02:34:48,590
I don't have any guy looks really give 
it all to dogs and sick relatives,

3429
02:34:51,260 --> 02:34:52,093
you know,
hurting.

3430
02:34:52,690 --> 02:34:53,523
Um,
it's,

3431
02:34:53,590 --> 02:34:55,390
you don't have an issue with money,
right?

3432
02:34:55,510 --> 02:34:58,210
It's like the person that you're dating,
if they're successful,

3433
02:34:58,270 --> 02:35:00,250
likely they don't have an issue with 
money either.

3434
02:35:00,340 --> 02:35:02,140
So if people don'T have an issue with 
money,

3435
02:35:02,380 --> 02:35:05,410
money should just be like fun coupons.
She'll be like,

3436
02:35:05,411 --> 02:35:10,411
what can we do something that doesn't 
have any money?

3437
02:35:11,710 --> 02:35:12,543
Then it becomes weird and it could,
it depends on what kind of relationship 

3438
02:35:16,331 --> 02:35:17,830
you have with the person.
But It also,

3439
02:35:17,831 --> 02:35:19,210
it's like what,
uh,

3440
02:35:19,480 --> 02:35:21,070
like,
what's the purpose of this?

3441
02:35:21,071 --> 02:35:23,280
It's like a control thing or is it just 
like,

3442
02:35:23,350 --> 02:35:24,790
let's go have fun thing?
Yeah.

3443
02:35:25,920 --> 02:35:26,753
Yeah.
So like if ben affleck was dating 

3444
02:35:29,561 --> 02:35:31,620
Jennifer Lopez,
they're both fucking kajillion.

3445
02:35:31,630 --> 02:35:32,860
Doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.

3446
02:35:34,060 --> 02:35:35,320
here's a car,
here's the whatever.

3447
02:35:35,780 --> 02:35:37,840
Yeah.
Like if ben orders the private jet,

3448
02:35:38,500 --> 02:35:39,880
jennifer doesn't go like,
fuck you bitch.

3449
02:35:39,910 --> 02:35:43,730
I'm paying for this.
She doesn't even know.

3450
02:35:43,750 --> 02:35:45,430
I don't even know.
I don't care.

3451
02:35:45,760 --> 02:35:46,451
But it's like,
yeah,

3452
02:35:46,451 --> 02:35:47,440
it's fun.
Coupons.

3453
02:35:47,530 --> 02:35:50,920
They feel like money is the last 
frontier of weird.

3454
02:35:51,710 --> 02:35:53,230
It can be.
It's anonymous.

3455
02:35:53,570 --> 02:35:54,403
It's just so symbolic.
I feel like now I've had financial 

3456
02:35:57,371 --> 02:36:00,400
arrangements with friends before they go
south and it just gets real weird.

3457
02:36:00,610 --> 02:36:01,443
If you were dating now,
let's say we're some alternative string 

3458
02:36:04,091 --> 02:36:04,924
theory universe where you were dating,
would you pay for everything if you're 

3459
02:36:07,421 --> 02:36:08,380
starting from scratch?

3460
02:36:09,190 --> 02:36:11,620
If I was starting from scratch with a 
new person,

3461
02:36:12,130 --> 02:36:12,963
for sure.
if the person didn't have money and one 

3462
02:36:15,401 --> 02:36:18,730
of the reasons why I like paying,
it's because I like to tip a lot,

3463
02:36:18,760 --> 02:36:21,160
but what if you date someone who has 
money,

3464
02:36:21,800 --> 02:36:23,860
then I'm going to give a fuck.
then you split it.

3465
02:36:23,861 --> 02:36:24,611
Yeah,
like my friends,

3466
02:36:24,611 --> 02:36:25,444
like if I go out,
my friend stayed with a woman is 

3467
02:36:26,531 --> 02:36:28,720
different.
Well it depends.

3468
02:36:28,730 --> 02:36:31,660
I would be more than happy to pay 
because I don't give a fuck,

3469
02:36:31,960 --> 02:36:34,360
but if they for some reason wanted to 
pay,

3470
02:36:34,361 --> 02:36:35,650
I wouldn't give a fuck about that 
either.

3471
02:36:35,750 --> 02:36:39,850
But like okay,
as long as it didn't feel weird.

3472
02:36:39,970 --> 02:36:40,803
But like I've met guys where the guide 
doesn't make any money and the woman 

3473
02:36:43,841 --> 02:36:44,674
makes a ton of money and the woman pays 
for everything and that relationship 

3474
02:36:48,280 --> 02:36:50,230
always gets squirrely.
Ever.

3475
02:36:50,720 --> 02:36:51,990
World.
I'm your mother,

3476
02:36:52,270 --> 02:36:55,210
but it doesn't correlate the other way.
it can work.

3477
02:36:55,240 --> 02:36:56,073
Like if the guy has a ton of money and 
the woman does it definitely can work 

3478
02:36:59,580 --> 02:37:01,110
and I don't know why.
I mean I don't,

3479
02:37:01,570 --> 02:37:04,900
I'm not saying it's impossible.
It's alpha though.

3480
02:37:04,960 --> 02:37:05,793
It's just not likely.
It's not likely that that's going to 

3481
02:37:07,181 --> 02:37:08,014
work for whatever reason.
I never know if paying makes things 

3482
02:37:10,751 --> 02:37:12,370
weird or if it's,
you know,

3483
02:37:12,490 --> 02:37:13,323
like beyonce and jay z.
Do you think they give a fuck about who 

3484
02:37:15,381 --> 02:37:16,280
pays for something

3485
02:37:16,280 --> 02:37:20,000
that sells bell?
I am the happiest person on the planet.

3486
02:37:20,001 --> 02:37:21,350
That would be hilarious.
Sammut.

3487
02:37:21,410 --> 02:37:24,560
Now I got the shampoo.
If you could just put this into carts,

3488
02:37:25,520 --> 02:37:29,710
but I think you're obligated at that 
level of fame to tip ridiculously.

3489
02:37:29,740 --> 02:37:30,340
Yeah.
Yeah.

3490
02:37:30,340 --> 02:37:33,410
I just heard somewhere that 20 percent 
is actually not a good tip.

3491
02:37:33,740 --> 02:37:34,573
Really?
Yeah.

3492
02:37:35,110 --> 02:37:36,220
Yeah.
I think that's a good tip.

3493
02:37:36,230 --> 02:37:37,063
Someone,
a friend of mine who has a daughter 

3494
02:37:38,121 --> 02:37:39,980
who's a waitress,
said the waitress is like,

3495
02:37:40,040 --> 02:37:43,420
that's now not so what is it now?
Twenty five.

3496
02:37:43,930 --> 02:37:46,130
I don't know.
I guess so give me all your money.

3497
02:37:46,131 --> 02:37:47,280
Fuck yeah.
Like what is that?

3498
02:37:47,950 --> 02:37:51,370
It's just like such a nightmare.
I feel like I'm always standard standard

3499
02:37:52,220 --> 02:37:54,590
20th expecting used to be 15.
right.

3500
02:37:54,690 --> 02:37:55,523
You start working at a restaurant.
One oF the last jobs I had was like a 

3501
02:38:01,490 --> 02:38:02,323
day.
It was a brand new restaurant and the 

3502
02:38:03,411 --> 02:38:04,244
rule they were coming up with to decide 
how much we had to tip out to our 

3503
02:38:06,771 --> 02:38:11,771
coworkers was basing it off of us 
getting 20 percent off of every table.

3504
02:38:11,960 --> 02:38:13,700
Wow.
Twenty percent is expected.

3505
02:38:13,910 --> 02:38:14,743
Fucked up Man,
because then they're screwing you 

3506
02:38:16,311 --> 02:38:18,140
because you know there's gonna be a lot 
of cheap people.

3507
02:38:18,160 --> 02:38:20,240
Yeah.
I've seen some people leave some fucking

3508
02:38:20,241 --> 02:38:22,440
horrendous tips.
It really bothers.

3509
02:38:22,520 --> 02:38:24,260
Honestly.
That is my number one pet peeve.

3510
02:38:24,261 --> 02:38:25,970
It makes me sick.
It's just so selfish.

3511
02:38:26,010 --> 02:38:26,843
Unless you're super broke and like 
you're barely pay and then honestly you 

3512
02:38:29,841 --> 02:38:32,510
probably shouldn't be just don't be 
going out to restaurants,

3513
02:38:32,750 --> 02:38:33,880
but yeah.
But how do you,

3514
02:38:33,890 --> 02:38:35,150
how are people supposed to know this 
stuff?

3515
02:38:35,151 --> 02:38:38,870
Because I thought it was 15 percent go 
out.

3516
02:38:38,871 --> 02:38:39,704
That's another service started getting 
mad and like we shouldn't be going out 

3517
02:38:41,541 --> 02:38:45,170
to eat if you can't afford a 20 percent 
tip and then add 20 percent to the whole

3518
02:38:45,171 --> 02:38:46,004
bill.
This is a place that I go to a sushi 

3519
02:38:47,361 --> 02:38:52,361
place to put the tip on the bill.
Always kinda liked that hotels.

3520
02:38:52,640 --> 02:38:53,473
It's always a gratuity included,
which is like how shitty is your 

3521
02:38:55,461 --> 02:38:59,480
clientele that you have to include 
gratuity because you don't trust them?

3522
02:38:59,780 --> 02:39:01,850
Well,
it's not necessarily that.

3523
02:39:01,851 --> 02:39:03,800
It's just like you take it out of the 
equation.

3524
02:39:04,250 --> 02:39:05,850
It's nice to not have to think about it 
and be like,

3525
02:39:05,860 --> 02:39:08,630
just like that's the worst part.
At the end of the day when you're like,

3526
02:39:08,660 --> 02:39:10,520
what's the,
what's the percentage?

3527
02:39:10,710 --> 02:39:13,700
It's weird that those people who are 
working don't get paid.

3528
02:39:13,701 --> 02:39:15,590
RIght?
They only get paid through tips.

3529
02:39:15,591 --> 02:39:18,580
Like people say they rely on your tips 
as a way to do.

3530
02:39:18,590 --> 02:39:21,240
Only make tips that's fucked up.
I had no idea.

3531
02:39:21,470 --> 02:39:23,090
why don't you pay them?
like why are they.

3532
02:39:23,220 --> 02:39:25,820
Why don't they get some kind of lump sum
can fire them,

3533
02:39:25,821 --> 02:39:27,440
but you don't have to pay them or you 
pay them.

3534
02:39:27,441 --> 02:39:28,640
Very little.
Good insurance?

3535
02:39:28,830 --> 02:39:30,650
No.
Where did you work in Ohio,

3536
02:39:30,800 --> 02:39:31,910
which is a right to work state.

3537
02:39:32,030 --> 02:39:33,530
What kind of restaurant?
Uh,

3538
02:39:33,531 --> 02:39:37,220
all kinds I worked at a chain.
Opens up health insurance.

3539
02:39:37,270 --> 02:39:37,590
No,
no,

3540
02:39:37,590 --> 02:39:37,771
no,
no,

3541
02:39:37,771 --> 02:39:38,350
no,
no.

3542
02:39:38,350 --> 02:39:41,720
Just tips is also pre obamacare.
So I don't know how actually works now,

3543
02:39:41,721 --> 02:39:44,420
but like you,
I wouldn't have been able to afford it.

3544
02:39:44,840 --> 02:39:45,673
I can tell you that.
How much money a night in tips for a 

3545
02:39:47,361 --> 02:39:48,194
guy.
It's also different between guys and 

3546
02:39:49,191 --> 02:39:50,024
girls there too.
Is that like the one profession where 

3547
02:39:52,551 --> 02:39:53,384
guys get fucking.
It's a woman's game was discussing the 

3548
02:39:56,560 --> 02:40:00,560
other night and we kind of came to the 
conclusion that might be not for sure,

3549
02:40:00,561 --> 02:40:01,394
but it might be that um,
let's say a guy's taking care of the 

3550
02:40:03,591 --> 02:40:04,424
bill,
he might feel shittier or it might be 

3551
02:40:06,900 --> 02:40:07,733
more okay being shittier to a guy than a
girl that's taken care of them for 

3552
02:40:11,781 --> 02:40:12,614
whatever reason.
Might be lots of things could play into 

3553
02:40:13,921 --> 02:40:14,100
that.

3554
02:40:14,100 --> 02:40:14,933
But that's kind of where we arrived to 
where we're all sitting and really 

3555
02:40:17,610 --> 02:40:19,070
servers to two of the girls talking.

3556
02:40:19,200 --> 02:40:20,033
Well,
a lot of men have weird competition 

3557
02:40:20,811 --> 02:40:21,644
issues with other men.
Let's got him some guys bringing your 

3558
02:40:22,851 --> 02:40:23,271
food.
You're like,

3559
02:40:23,271 --> 02:40:24,670
fuck that guy.
You can shitty.

3560
02:40:24,700 --> 02:40:24,990
Yeah,

3561
02:40:24,990 --> 02:40:27,420
just shitty of that way and like you 
don't want to be mean to a girl.

3562
02:40:27,421 --> 02:40:29,400
You don't want to make her cry if that 
might not happen,

3563
02:40:29,401 --> 02:40:32,040
but you just don't.
You think it could and you just make all

3564
02:40:32,041 --> 02:40:33,240
your decisions based off of that.

3565
02:40:33,330 --> 02:40:35,010
Yeah.
That is so nuts.

3566
02:40:35,011 --> 02:40:36,900
I never thought about like being a male 
waiter,

3567
02:40:36,901 --> 02:40:39,480
you're going to make less money than a 
woman probably.

3568
02:40:39,630 --> 02:40:41,490
Unless you're really good at it.
It's a sexist professional,

3569
02:40:41,520 --> 02:40:42,353
but you're a really good restaurant.
You like a really good male waiter who 

3570
02:40:45,151 --> 02:40:48,040
knows exactly what kind of fucking dijon
salt,

3571
02:40:48,410 --> 02:40:49,460
the preparation

3572
02:40:49,730 --> 02:40:50,563
then it's.
You have to be almost way above and 

3573
02:40:52,231 --> 02:40:56,050
beyond the job knowing way deep being 
anticipating everything.

3574
02:40:56,790 --> 02:40:59,250
100 bucks.
Maybe it was a good decent night,

3575
02:40:59,251 --> 02:41:01,710
but like out here,
you'd be expecting to make three or $400

3576
02:41:01,711 --> 02:41:03,330
a night or you wouldn't probably 
survive.

3577
02:41:03,430 --> 02:41:05,080
Right?
But a lot of us out here,

3578
02:41:05,110 --> 02:41:06,730
you want to work at a place that serves 
alcohol though,

3579
02:41:06,731 --> 02:41:09,420
right?
For for cash.

3580
02:41:09,500 --> 02:41:11,980
That's the only way to make money.
But I would think that if you were,

3581
02:41:12,010 --> 02:41:13,880
if you were like a waiter,
like,

3582
02:41:14,010 --> 02:41:14,843
like it's always fascinating.
Most fasting when you go to a nice 

3583
02:41:17,380 --> 02:41:19,450
restaurant and the waiters obviously 
from Italy.

3584
02:41:20,530 --> 02:41:21,450
Oh,
interesting.

3585
02:41:21,451 --> 02:41:22,570
I'm coughing.
Jesus christ.

3586
02:41:23,250 --> 02:41:24,083
Yeah.
I just have phlegm.

3587
02:41:24,730 --> 02:41:27,370
But if the weight is from Italy,
like it's more impressive.

3588
02:41:27,430 --> 02:41:28,790
Right.
You got a nice title restaurant.

3589
02:41:31,030 --> 02:41:33,130
What do they bring those guys over?
How's that work?

3590
02:41:33,131 --> 02:41:35,080
Do they have like some sort of a 
service?

3591
02:41:35,890 --> 02:41:36,723
Restaurants like request the services 
because italians take service way more 

3592
02:41:41,921 --> 02:41:44,230
seriously than we do it.
Everybody who is working as a waiter,

3593
02:41:44,380 --> 02:41:45,213
I feel like at least certainly out here 
is trying to do something else for a 

3594
02:41:47,141 --> 02:41:47,560
living.
Right.

3595
02:41:47,560 --> 02:41:48,393
But it makes your restaurant more legit.
Like you don't even know who the fuck 

3596
02:41:50,801 --> 02:41:51,634
cooking.
It could be a straight up white guy in 

3597
02:41:52,351 --> 02:41:53,620
the back.
It doesn't bother you.

3598
02:41:53,621 --> 02:41:57,160
But as long as it's an italian person 
explaining what the right,

3599
02:41:57,610 --> 02:41:59,260
you know,
an ncaa can of the words,

3600
02:41:59,620 --> 02:42:00,453
you're just enchanted.
What's the most fucked up thing you've 

3601
02:42:01,811 --> 02:42:03,940
ever seen a restaurant like restaurants 
or just nightmares,

3602
02:42:03,941 --> 02:42:04,770
right?

3603
02:42:04,770 --> 02:42:05,603
not fucked up,
but I just remember because I explained 

3604
02:42:06,981 --> 02:42:07,814
this to the newer restaurant I worked at
that was expect expecting that 20 

3605
02:42:10,641 --> 02:42:11,474
percent.
The clientele they weRe trying to 

3606
02:42:12,111 --> 02:42:14,420
attract with like a white tablecloth 
kind of thing.

3607
02:42:14,750 --> 02:42:15,583
Although it was not in that kind of 
place and was not that kind of 

3608
02:42:17,571 --> 02:42:18,404
restaurant.
And one of my first tables I got that 

3609
02:42:20,331 --> 02:42:22,280
was expecting that service I like 
cleared.

3610
02:42:22,760 --> 02:42:25,420
The gentleman's played before his wife 
for.

3611
02:42:25,460 --> 02:42:30,080
She was mostly being done eating.
I literally got yelled at about that and

3612
02:42:30,081 --> 02:42:34,940
explain to why you shouldn't do that.
And my boss,

3613
02:42:34,941 --> 02:42:37,540
he got yelled at by the client and then 
he left the next day.

3614
02:42:37,541 --> 02:42:38,001
He's like,
hey,

3615
02:42:38,001 --> 02:42:38,834
just so you know,
don't take people's plates until 

3616
02:42:40,701 --> 02:42:41,660
everybody's done.
I was like,

3617
02:42:42,500 --> 02:42:45,740
it's what?
That iS just a weird thing.

3618
02:42:45,741 --> 02:42:46,574
And then

3619
02:42:47,680 --> 02:42:50,000
I hear there's no such thing as chilean 
sea bass.

3620
02:42:50,001 --> 02:42:50,834
That's not a real thing.
They just take white fish and they call 

3621
02:42:52,311 --> 02:42:54,490
it a bunch of other shit so they can 
charge different things.

3622
02:42:55,310 --> 02:42:59,030
Definitely chilean sea bass,
like an invention,

3623
02:43:00,110 --> 02:43:02,330
like a restaurant invention.
The look up New York times.

3624
02:43:02,360 --> 02:43:03,193
They also say,
don't eat sushi in Oklahoma city and 

3625
02:43:04,401 --> 02:43:06,080
shit like that,
but that's not what she's saying.

3626
02:43:06,130 --> 02:43:08,720
She's saying chilean sea bass is not a 
real fish.

3627
02:43:09,060 --> 02:43:12,100
Apparently restaurants just take random 
fish and call it a bunch

3628
02:43:12,100 --> 02:43:14,150
of fancy.
Really?

3629
02:43:14,500 --> 02:43:17,860
Chilean sea bass has a very interesting 
and unique buttery taste to it.

3630
02:43:17,861 --> 02:43:18,694
Like don't.
A lot of restaurants just take garbage 

3631
02:43:20,321 --> 02:43:21,154
fish and put a bunch of salt on it and 
it definitely dancing that they found 

3632
02:43:23,531 --> 02:43:25,810
that people lie about the type of sushi 
you're eating.

3633
02:43:25,811 --> 02:43:28,210
Oftentimes fake fish on your plate,
right?

3634
02:43:28,211 --> 02:43:30,250
But that's chilean sea bass.
He just ordered.

3635
02:43:30,280 --> 02:43:32,950
It isn't a bass and it probably didn't 
come from Chile.

3636
02:43:34,490 --> 02:43:37,870
What does it?
It says,

3637
02:43:38,530 --> 02:43:39,610
fuck,
this is crazy.

3638
02:43:40,150 --> 02:43:42,640
Chilean sea bass is a fraud.
First off,

3639
02:43:42,820 --> 02:43:44,410
it's not really a bass.
It's a cod.

3640
02:43:44,440 --> 02:43:45,161
Oh,
that makes sense.

3641
02:43:45,161 --> 02:43:46,950
Because you know what it tastes like.
Miso,

3642
02:43:46,960 --> 02:43:48,370
cod,
so cotton,

3643
02:43:48,380 --> 02:43:49,840
chilean sea bass,
buttery.

3644
02:43:50,750 --> 02:43:51,583
Right?
Until the late 19 seventies named 

3645
02:43:52,661 --> 02:43:53,494
chilean sea bass didn't exist,
the fish went by the unappetizing name 

3646
02:43:56,770 --> 02:44:00,340
of the patagonian toothfish.
Oh,

3647
02:44:00,360 --> 02:44:02,170
okay.
So it is an actual animal.

3648
02:44:02,170 --> 02:44:04,090
It's just not a bass.
So that makes sense.

3649
02:44:04,091 --> 02:44:07,610
Why it's uniform and its flavor,
but it's on a bass.

3650
02:44:07,640 --> 02:44:08,980
The cock.
That's better.

3651
02:44:09,320 --> 02:44:11,620
Tastes better than bass.
That's why it's interesting because bass

3652
02:44:11,630 --> 02:44:12,463
doesn't taste good.
Most bass is a bass or not like the 

3653
02:44:15,071 --> 02:44:18,010
tastiest fish.
Really fishy.

3654
02:44:18,100 --> 02:44:21,820
The large money fast are kind of boring.
Tuna used to be cat food.

3655
02:44:22,170 --> 02:44:25,510
It used to be trash fish.
That's hilarious.

3656
02:44:25,810 --> 02:44:28,300
Until the 19 seventies,
bluefin tuna was considered a trash fish

3657
02:44:28,301 --> 02:44:29,590
suitable for cat food.
Today,

3658
02:44:29,591 --> 02:44:31,600
it's one of the most prized fish in the 
world.

3659
02:44:31,660 --> 02:44:35,800
That's hilarious.
As the bluefin sushi craze spread across

3660
02:44:35,801 --> 02:44:39,040
Japan from Japan,
the United States over fishing triggered

3661
02:44:39,041 --> 02:44:42,340
a 95 percent decline in the fish 
population.

3662
02:44:42,550 --> 02:44:43,960
Holy fuck.
Crazy.

3663
02:44:43,990 --> 02:44:47,860
Ninety five percent since 19 seventies 
going extinct,

3664
02:44:47,861 --> 02:44:48,694
isn't it?
Oh,

3665
02:44:48,870 --> 02:44:50,440
That's not good.
Ninety five percent.

3666
02:44:50,441 --> 02:44:51,274
I'm not a doctor,
but like go outside or sick up attend 

3667
02:44:53,790 --> 02:44:54,623
event.

3668
02:44:54,700 --> 02:44:55,533
Uh,
when seafood buyers found the fish 

3669
02:44:56,561 --> 02:44:57,394
adaptable in terms of taste and texture,
they rebranded as chilean sea bass and 

3670
02:44:59,951 --> 02:45:02,750
peddled it as a gourmet fair.
Is that legal to just lie about.

3671
02:45:03,600 --> 02:45:04,433
Look at what they're saying today.
Much of the fish sold as chilean sea 

3672
02:45:06,611 --> 02:45:10,720
bass comes from the an arctic waters,
not the chilean coast.

3673
02:45:11,320 --> 02:45:12,320
Whoa.
Is that,

3674
02:45:12,340 --> 02:45:13,173
isn't that like false advertising or 
like blasphemy or isn't there some law 

3675
02:45:15,791 --> 02:45:18,040
against just lying about food?
Look,

3676
02:45:18,041 --> 02:45:19,360
it's the same thing though.
Look long,

3677
02:45:19,361 --> 02:45:20,194
considered worthless.
The patagonian toothfish can live up to 

3678
02:45:22,421 --> 02:45:23,254
50 years and grow to seven feet long.
But when seafood buyers found the fish 

3679
02:45:26,921 --> 02:45:27,754
adaptable in terms of taste and texture,
they rebranded it as chilean sea bass 

3680
02:45:31,151 --> 02:45:34,330
and peddled it as gore.
Mayfair scam.

3681
02:45:36,990 --> 02:45:38,770
So disappointed.
Real talk.

3682
02:45:38,830 --> 02:45:41,120
Real talk a lot.
Don't you think?

3683
02:45:41,210 --> 02:45:46,210
got enough bullshit on my mind.
You got to press your head.

3684
02:45:48,160 --> 02:45:48,993
My favorite is pitch.
I wish you would burn my mother fucking 

3685
02:45:52,280 --> 02:45:53,113
clothes.
We all wish someone would burn your 

3686
02:45:55,541 --> 02:45:56,420
clothes.
aren't kelly there?

3687
02:45:56,430 --> 02:45:57,720
Just stick.
I love it.

3688
02:45:57,721 --> 02:45:58,554
Like it's more like,
don't you know how many sexual 

3689
02:46:00,581 --> 02:46:04,930
harassment lawsuIts I have?
All my kelly have on his mind.

3690
02:46:04,960 --> 02:46:08,710
Does he have a lot on his plate?
I don't think he's remarkably calm.

3691
02:46:09,060 --> 02:46:10,010
Yeah.
Of this

3692
02:46:10,520 --> 02:46:12,260
old is r kelly.
He's 80.

3693
02:46:12,740 --> 02:46:17,000
He seems to be like gliding through five
for 78 years.

3694
02:46:17,120 --> 02:46:19,520
He's,
he seems to be gliding through any forms

3695
02:46:19,521 --> 02:46:21,140
of controversy.
Like relatively.

3696
02:46:22,590 --> 02:46:24,460
Oh,
godly toms.

3697
02:46:24,530 --> 02:46:26,600
It's 50 slash 50 this year.
50.

3698
02:46:27,470 --> 02:46:28,560
How much one is he worth?
Let's say?

3699
02:46:28,561 --> 02:46:30,560
Yes,
way more.

3700
02:46:30,600 --> 02:46:33,280
Hundred million.
Just write his own songs or whatever the

3701
02:46:33,320 --> 02:46:35,590
thought.
Take somebody else's writing that shit.

3702
02:46:43,990 --> 02:46:44,823
One hundred and $50 million.
That's a low number that he's got 

3703
02:46:51,321 --> 02:46:54,410
probably $150 million stored in his 
fucking basement somewhere.

3704
02:46:55,980 --> 02:46:58,490
Yeah,
they concerts.

3705
02:46:58,520 --> 02:47:00,920
He's constantly live shows.
You're right.

3706
02:47:00,921 --> 02:47:01,481
You're right.
You're right.

3707
02:47:01,481 --> 02:47:04,810
It sells out giant places.
Every time you sell out a giant places.

3708
02:47:04,920 --> 02:47:07,800
Website is towards hundreds of 
thousands.

3709
02:47:08,330 --> 02:47:12,710
Constantly tourinG tours.
He tours a lot when he's not fucking.

3710
02:47:12,810 --> 02:47:16,040
Oh,
look at that.

3711
02:47:16,150 --> 02:47:19,990
Go to events.
That's a beautiful photograph.

3712
02:47:20,930 --> 02:47:25,930
Ontario.
California is a rodeo arena bitch arena.

3713
02:47:26,610 --> 02:47:27,860
You know,
why do an ontario?

3714
02:47:27,861 --> 02:47:32,861
I do the fucking improv.
The citizens on citizens bank arena.

3715
02:47:34,040 --> 02:47:37,220
That's like a 20,000
seat soccer bucks.

3716
02:47:37,280 --> 02:47:41,600
50 bucks the after party tour.
So no one's mad.

3717
02:47:41,690 --> 02:47:43,370
No one's mad about,
oh,

3718
02:47:43,371 --> 02:47:46,760
127 bucks.
We'll talk.

3719
02:47:48,170 --> 02:47:49,090
Fuck you.
Fuck you.

3720
02:47:50,070 --> 02:47:53,360
Hey girl gunpoint.
You know what?

3721
02:47:53,450 --> 02:47:54,750
Nevermind,
I'll stop.

3722
02:47:55,250 --> 02:47:57,420
That was a cogent point.
He's um,

3723
02:47:57,730 --> 02:47:58,563
he's still raking it in.
He does those every now and then rick's 

3724
02:48:01,041 --> 02:48:05,510
in the cash,
goes back to a sex slave slangs until he

3725
02:48:05,511 --> 02:48:06,344
falls asleep.
So do you have to pay to be in the sex 

3726
02:48:07,821 --> 02:48:08,511
cult,
john?

3727
02:48:08,511 --> 02:48:11,210
Everybody pays her integrity and 
everybody.

3728
02:48:11,211 --> 02:48:12,980
Petrel health,
everybody pays.

3729
02:48:12,990 --> 02:48:15,320
Go listen to it emotionally.
You have to take notes.

3730
02:48:15,530 --> 02:48:18,550
Fifty years old,
$150 million.

3731
02:48:19,730 --> 02:48:22,770
Sold over 100 million albums.
woo.

3732
02:48:23,920 --> 02:48:25,930
It's amazing.
He's only got 150 million left.

3733
02:48:25,970 --> 02:48:27,570
What?
He's got a dollar an album.

3734
02:48:27,571 --> 02:48:29,290
That's crazy.
You've got to get a new manager.

3735
02:48:29,990 --> 02:48:30,823
Actually.
Pretty good.

3736
02:48:30,950 --> 02:48:33,770
I saved that.
A dollar album's pretty good.

3737
02:48:34,460 --> 02:48:37,610
B,
we just think that guy that plus concert

3738
02:48:37,611 --> 02:48:40,130
sales,
like he maybe he's got a lot more money.

3739
02:48:40,260 --> 02:48:41,750
Man,
you know those fucking people don't know

3740
02:48:41,751 --> 02:48:43,730
that celebrity network,
they're just making guesses.

3741
02:48:43,731 --> 02:48:45,320
So I was going to say,
what is that based on?

3742
02:48:45,321 --> 02:48:50,000
I've gone to mind and it's not true.
I don't think how much.

3743
02:48:50,001 --> 02:48:53,470
I literally have no idea.
Fifty nine and kelly,

3744
02:48:53,480 --> 02:48:56,780
I need you to support her.
X r kelly.

3745
02:48:59,390 --> 02:49:00,223
Kelly's ex wife.
He agreed to a $50 million dollar 

3746
02:49:02,751 --> 02:49:05,390
settlement with his ex wife were they 
married more than 10 years.

3747
02:49:05,391 --> 02:49:07,650
So it must have been because in you get

3748
02:49:08,440 --> 02:49:10,200
home after choreograph and blah,
blah,

3749
02:49:10,201 --> 02:49:11,034
blah.
When she auditioned to be one of his 

3750
02:49:11,911 --> 02:49:14,580
backup dancers in 1994,
they married in [inaudible] 96.

3751
02:49:14,581 --> 02:49:17,970
They had three children.
Can't afford a divorce in 2009.

3752
02:49:18,270 --> 02:49:19,103
Since then,
he has gone on a dick slinging epic 

3753
02:49:22,201 --> 02:49:23,720
proportion.
The senior,

3754
02:49:23,980 --> 02:49:24,813
uh,
explain the grounds of their divorce in 

3755
02:49:26,791 --> 02:49:30,900
his 2012 auto biography.
Solar coaster.

3756
02:49:30,990 --> 02:49:32,220
The dIary of me

3757
02:49:33,330 --> 02:49:38,330
live that book then diary my diary.
Diary of me egomania coaster.

3758
02:49:44,910 --> 02:49:49,450
It's been a solar coaster.
It's been a solo coast towns,

3759
02:49:50,580 --> 02:49:55,200
but I'm hearing that you can just say my
direct solar coaster.

3760
02:49:55,201 --> 02:49:58,140
Why would he want it looks so awesome.
Look at all those microphones point that

3761
02:49:58,400 --> 02:50:02,190
I'm flying.
That looks like the cover of the rosetta

3762
02:50:02,191 --> 02:50:03,024
stone.
Looks like maybe the greatest book of 

3763
02:50:03,841 --> 02:50:07,770
all time and 199 consumer reviews and 
four and a half fucking stars.

3764
02:50:07,771 --> 02:50:09,840
That's what I'm seeing.
I'm seeing success.

3765
02:50:10,020 --> 02:50:13,670
I'll talk.
do you know that matthew mcconaughey,

3766
02:50:13,671 --> 02:50:15,180
his mother has a book.
It's called.

3767
02:50:15,181 --> 02:50:16,014
I amaze myself.

3768
02:50:16,890 --> 02:50:17,723
Cool.

3769
02:50:18,840 --> 02:50:23,840
I didn't want to pick anybody's mom.
realize I've ever seen you.

3770
02:50:24,381 --> 02:50:26,870
She talks about paid out millions and 
out of court,

3771
02:50:26,871 --> 02:50:29,540
sexual misconduct settlements.
We'll talk.

3772
02:50:33,720 --> 02:50:35,990
Fuck you.
You think I got enough?

3773
02:50:36,710 --> 02:50:40,850
Boom.
Were you all?

3774
02:50:41,220 --> 02:50:42,090
Hey,
I mean,

3775
02:50:42,390 --> 02:50:44,850
he's finding people that like to live 
his way.

3776
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:48,060
Like you could start a cult.
You kind of have a golf.

3777
02:50:48,100 --> 02:50:48,933
Actually,
I think pretty much anybody can start a 

3778
02:50:51,870 --> 02:50:52,703
call.
I know some shitty comedian that's 

3779
02:50:54,391 --> 02:50:55,590
basically started a cult

3780
02:50:57,130 --> 02:50:57,831
gotta go.
Yeah.

3781
02:50:57,831 --> 02:51:02,180
I'll write it down.
It's more common than you would think.

3782
02:51:02,330 --> 02:51:06,270
I think like people have.
Yeah.

3783
02:51:07,250 --> 02:51:08,360
Yeah.
That one.

3784
02:51:09,260 --> 02:51:10,093
I think there's.
I think there's a lot of people that 

3785
02:51:12,411 --> 02:51:13,244
want to be led.
I think there's a lot of people that 

3786
02:51:15,561 --> 02:51:17,600
like,
just how some people are born tall.

3787
02:51:17,880 --> 02:51:18,713
I mean I joke about this,
like what I was trying to explain to my 

3788
02:51:20,451 --> 02:51:22,040
kids something and I was like,
you know,

3789
02:51:22,041 --> 02:51:24,980
some people are big ears and some people
have literally years old,

3790
02:51:24,981 --> 02:51:29,480
some people have brains that are made 
out of dog shit and then you find people

3791
02:51:29,481 --> 02:51:31,520
that are dumber than them that let them 
have sex with them.

3792
02:51:31,560 --> 02:51:32,393
yeah.
And then they make kids and those kids 

3793
02:51:33,141 --> 02:51:34,910
are fucked and don't let anybody tell 
you any different.

3794
02:51:35,630 --> 02:51:40,630
And if you have a really low watt brain 
and you run into some charismatic figure

3795
02:51:40,671 --> 02:51:41,504
that you feel,
didn't we just see this happen in 

3796
02:51:43,341 --> 02:51:44,490
november?
Yeah.

3797
02:51:45,140 --> 02:51:46,520
There's a lot of that.
When that's.

3798
02:51:46,580 --> 02:51:48,200
I mean that's what a lot of what 
happened,

3799
02:51:48,201 --> 02:51:49,400
right?
A lot of people who would

3800
02:51:50,120 --> 02:51:52,980
finally,
finally let them know,

3801
02:51:54,460 --> 02:51:57,170
my president.
You fucking let your president until you

3802
02:51:57,220 --> 02:52:00,020
pj real talk.
Yeah,

3803
02:52:00,030 --> 02:52:01,800
you can.
There's a lot of monkeys out there.

3804
02:52:01,830 --> 02:52:03,000
Yeah,
they're really dumb people.

3805
02:52:03,030 --> 02:52:06,010
I just want to be told what to do by 
someone who's confident and alpha.

3806
02:52:06,090 --> 02:52:06,923
It's 100 percent absolutely evident to 
almost anybody that I know that's 

3807
02:52:10,301 --> 02:52:11,770
honest,
that there are people out there that are

3808
02:52:11,771 --> 02:52:12,604
far smarter than them,
right when I have him on my podcast all 

3809
02:52:15,011 --> 02:52:18,910
the time I talked to astrophysicists and
it and people breaking down the,

3810
02:52:18,911 --> 02:52:19,370
the,
the,

3811
02:52:19,370 --> 02:52:20,203
the actual fiber of reality and he tried
to talk to them and have them explain 

3812
02:52:24,221 --> 02:52:26,160
things to you and you're like,
well,

3813
02:52:26,170 --> 02:52:28,930
bundonally clear that I'm not nearly as 
smart as them,

3814
02:52:28,990 --> 02:52:29,823
but I talked to a lot of people and I,
you tell like somewhere in the 

3815
02:52:32,801 --> 02:52:37,160
conversation like this is all you got to
work with you.

3816
02:52:37,240 --> 02:52:39,790
We've all met people.
Then it's not even their fault.

3817
02:52:39,970 --> 02:52:41,540
It's just like this is what they have to
work with it,

3818
02:52:41,550 --> 02:52:42,383
but nobody wants to entertain that idea.
So we all want to pretend that we're on 

3819
02:52:44,981 --> 02:52:45,814
the same starting line,
but what if we're not at the same 

3820
02:52:47,201 --> 02:52:48,034
starting line with dick size and width 
height and with a physical strength and 

3821
02:52:52,181 --> 02:52:53,980
with all the other attributes that 
people possess,

3822
02:52:54,070 --> 02:52:56,320
why the fuck would we be on the same 
with mine?

3823
02:52:57,220 --> 02:52:58,510
It's not.
It's not real.

3824
02:52:58,540 --> 02:53:02,530
If all of us had the same mind power,
we'd be extinct by now.

3825
02:53:02,880 --> 02:53:04,870
You've all just destroyed each other for
sure.

3826
02:53:05,080 --> 02:53:05,913
There's a general sort of range that 
most of us fall into and you can for 

3827
02:53:09,131 --> 02:53:09,964
sure improve upon that with really good 
schooling and and study and discipline 

3828
02:53:12,881 --> 02:53:13,714
and supportive family and all the.
All the good things that we all aware 

3829
02:53:16,151 --> 02:53:16,984
of,
but there's always going to be these 

3830
02:53:18,611 --> 02:53:19,444
fucking people that are way smarter.
There's going to be this elon musk's 

3831
02:53:22,620 --> 02:53:25,990
talk to them,
john carmax,

3832
02:53:25,991 --> 02:53:29,590
you're going to talk to them.
They were barely the same thing.

3833
02:53:30,210 --> 02:53:32,050
The same thing.
Yeah,

3834
02:53:32,250 --> 02:53:34,030
super computer.
So if that's the case,

3835
02:53:34,031 --> 02:53:35,590
if you're going to meet people like 
that,

3836
02:53:35,591 --> 02:53:36,424
and I think you have,
and I know I have for sure there's 

3837
02:53:39,401 --> 02:53:40,234
people that no matter what you say,
you're not going to help them and if 

3838
02:53:42,881 --> 02:53:45,910
that person,
that dumb person runs into an art kelly,

3839
02:53:46,300 --> 02:53:47,133
and it's like we're doing right now,
is communicating with saturn through 

3840
02:53:49,961 --> 02:53:51,490
love saturday.

3841
02:53:51,890 --> 02:53:52,723
This is of course sad and see they don't
want to go there because if you go 

3842
02:53:56,261 --> 02:53:58,000
there,
it will be all about the bliss.

3843
02:53:58,210 --> 02:54:00,490
One day we're going to get there,
we're going to get you through earth.

3844
02:54:01,030 --> 02:54:03,220
Then you get your through my bedroom and
they're gonna.

3845
02:54:03,250 --> 02:54:05,050
He's gonna fuck you.
To the center of saturn.

3846
02:54:06,250 --> 02:54:08,240
I have a hundred and $50.
Million dollars.

3847
02:54:08,380 --> 02:54:10,120
Yeah,
like when he's banging you just sorta,

3848
02:54:10,150 --> 02:54:10,983
sorta like when kinison was yelling 
about jesus and really sort of wanting 

3849
02:54:13,271 --> 02:54:14,104
to believe in you,
feel it in your body and I'll feed you 

3850
02:54:15,941 --> 02:54:18,250
dinner if you come to my house.
I mean,

3851
02:54:18,251 --> 02:54:21,550
I think it's really susceptible 
vulnerable people.

3852
02:54:21,680 --> 02:54:23,550
I want those cycling scientology preys 
on.

3853
02:54:23,770 --> 02:54:24,590
How about those?
Uh,

3854
02:54:24,590 --> 02:54:25,423
the comment people to kill themselves 
because they thought there was a ufo 

3855
02:54:27,311 --> 02:54:28,360
behind the comment.
Right?

3856
02:54:28,420 --> 02:54:30,640
Those were real people kill themselves 
during the eclipse.

3857
02:54:31,350 --> 02:54:33,190
Oops.
So I think there was a bunch of people.

3858
02:54:33,310 --> 02:54:34,780
I mean that's just like the new 
darwinism.

3859
02:54:34,781 --> 02:54:36,490
It's like the people who acquiesce to 
call it.

3860
02:54:36,500 --> 02:54:37,570
It's like,
that's just monitor data.

3861
02:54:37,580 --> 02:54:39,810
I hope it's not your kids,
but you know,

3862
02:54:40,290 --> 02:54:41,123
if I hope all their parents are dead 
already and luck someone gets killed 

3863
02:54:46,691 --> 02:54:48,550
himself during the eclipse,
they were going to go somehow.

3864
02:54:48,580 --> 02:54:50,860
Yeah.
It's like walking into a wall or falling

3865
02:54:50,861 --> 02:54:53,320
off a building or something.
It's not a good choice.

3866
02:54:54,250 --> 02:54:55,083
It's not the way to go,
but I think for sure like those people 

3867
02:54:58,991 --> 02:55:00,130
are always going to exist.
Right?

3868
02:55:00,131 --> 02:55:03,980
Those people like the heaven's gate cult
or who have so little to lose a need to

3869
02:55:03,980 --> 02:55:04,813
believe something that exists bigger 
than themselves or their brain doesn't 

3870
02:55:08,121 --> 02:55:09,380
work good.
You know,

3871
02:55:09,381 --> 02:55:14,381
there's certain people you know,
hey,

3872
02:55:15,030 --> 02:55:20,030
brain,
right?

3873
02:55:20,470 --> 02:55:23,540
Just doesn't work that good no matter 
what.

3874
02:55:24,110 --> 02:55:25,460
No matter what you do,
you're like,

3875
02:55:25,550 --> 02:55:27,320
oh,
by the way,

3876
02:55:27,440 --> 02:55:32,440
this is spelt wrong.
Get it even knows that.

3877
02:55:33,920 --> 02:55:35,770
So you're just operating on another 
level.

3878
02:55:35,771 --> 02:55:36,790
But there's some people,
right?

3879
02:55:36,830 --> 02:55:37,511
Yeah.
The,

3880
02:55:37,511 --> 02:55:39,990
you know,
for a fact like they can be.

3881
02:55:40,150 --> 02:55:42,860
There's certain,
especially like open ended pursuits,

3882
02:55:42,861 --> 02:55:44,870
like standup comedy.
It attracts those people,

3883
02:55:44,871 --> 02:55:45,704
right?
You need those perpetual open miker who 

3884
02:55:47,870 --> 02:55:49,390
are convinced that some labs.

3885
02:55:49,720 --> 02:55:50,560
No,
the guy who,

3886
02:55:50,710 --> 02:55:52,120
because you like,
we're not going to be heat.

3887
02:55:52,450 --> 02:55:53,283
Is that what you know?
But that is one of my favorite 

3888
02:55:55,540 --> 02:55:57,520
documentaries on the plate or whatever 
it is.

3889
02:55:57,550 --> 02:56:00,970
Movies on the planet a.
It's heartbreaking but amazing.

3890
02:56:01,050 --> 02:56:01,550
Uh,
it's,

3891
02:56:01,550 --> 02:56:02,383
it's,
it's unreal,

3892
02:56:02,390 --> 02:56:03,223
it's almost as good as that r kelly 
video you showed me in terms of the 

3893
02:56:05,441 --> 02:56:06,274
emotions that evokes.
But dId you ever see the guy at the 

3894
02:56:07,571 --> 02:56:09,100
comedy store who are adult house on his 
head?

3895
02:56:09,940 --> 02:56:10,773
no,

3896
02:56:10,810 --> 02:56:14,050
I think you missed that.
He was on the porch of the comedy store,

3897
02:56:14,051 --> 02:56:16,600
whatever,
the front patio for like a good year.

3898
02:56:16,730 --> 02:56:19,580
You were gone.
Dollhouse giant doll house.

3899
02:56:19,610 --> 02:56:20,443
Well,
that's a way to get people look at you 

3900
02:56:21,051 --> 02:56:25,610
and jesus guy and jesus guys got gotta 
look weird in because he's dressed up as

3901
02:56:25,611 --> 02:56:26,444
jesus.
like if the same guy dressed up as 

3902
02:56:27,711 --> 02:56:29,930
mohammed people like,
get the fuck out of here.

3903
02:56:30,350 --> 02:56:31,640
I mean,
what happens when,

3904
02:56:31,750 --> 02:56:35,240
when you're that guy who dresses up as 
jesus on sunset,

3905
02:56:35,540 --> 02:56:36,950
he's probably listening right now 
crying.

3906
02:56:36,980 --> 02:56:39,020
What does that,
what does that life look like?

3907
02:56:39,230 --> 02:56:40,880
What's your life look like?
So tweet me.

3908
02:56:43,550 --> 02:56:44,420
Google his network.

3909
02:56:45,540 --> 02:56:47,730
Either a trust fund kid and you're a 
billionaire.

3910
02:56:48,120 --> 02:56:48,953
Oh my god.

3911
02:56:50,230 --> 02:56:53,810
It's just probably not the smartest way 
to live.

3912
02:56:53,811 --> 02:56:58,811
But the message that he's given when he 
walks around like that is of one who was

3913
02:56:59,691 --> 02:57:02,090
a disciple of jesus.
So you see him,

3914
02:57:02,240 --> 02:57:05,740
he looks like jesus,
he's dressed like jesus and you think,

3915
02:57:05,760 --> 02:57:06,350
ah,
guys,

3916
02:57:06,350 --> 02:57:08,840
probably find out if he's jesus.
What

3917
02:57:10,630 --> 02:57:12,370
right is that?
What if I,

3918
02:57:12,490 --> 02:57:14,290
I've.
This isn't really my beliefs is done.

3919
02:57:14,291 --> 02:57:16,330
But if jesus were to come back,
where are we going to go?

3920
02:57:16,331 --> 02:57:17,164
Huh?

3921
02:57:17,200 --> 02:57:19,160
He would have to show,
first of all,

3922
02:57:19,161 --> 02:57:21,000
it's going to be in Israel.
Take pictures and things.

3923
02:57:21,010 --> 02:57:21,843
She was the crazy homeless guy.
Those people that are convinced that 

3924
02:57:23,391 --> 02:57:24,224
jesus,
when he returns is going to return to 

3925
02:57:25,341 --> 02:57:26,174
Israel.
So we have to secure the safety of 

3926
02:57:27,111 --> 02:57:27,944
Israel.
Those really super evangelical 

3927
02:57:29,751 --> 02:57:30,584
christians.
yeah.

3928
02:57:31,190 --> 02:57:33,890
Piece that advice piece.
While these people go over to Israel,

3929
02:57:34,250 --> 02:57:37,040
all these southerners,
all these southerners that a real,

3930
02:57:37,070 --> 02:57:37,903
real familiar with the lord's word,
and they go over there and they're 

3931
02:57:40,281 --> 02:57:41,114
literally talking about like where jesus
is going to return and it's going to be 

3932
02:57:43,761 --> 02:57:44,594
over here.
Sure.

3933
02:57:44,920 --> 02:57:47,000
I was going to speak.
Speak up on high.

3934
02:57:47,300 --> 02:57:50,120
They voted.
I think about.

3935
02:57:50,740 --> 02:57:51,573
This is the.
This is the area that's dictated in the 

3936
02:57:53,331 --> 02:57:56,210
bible more where he will return,
where your talk was,

3937
02:57:56,211 --> 02:57:57,044
that crazy thing called where they go 
over to Israel and they end up taking 

3938
02:57:59,031 --> 02:58:00,740
off all their clothes and jerusalem 
syndrome.

3939
02:58:02,250 --> 02:58:03,083
Jerusalem syndrome is like a mark.
Marin actually wrote a book called 

3940
02:58:06,301 --> 02:58:08,340
jerusalem syndrome.
Yeah.

3941
02:58:09,720 --> 02:58:10,231
But it's.
Yeah,

3942
02:58:10,231 --> 02:58:11,064
it's people that.
It's a relatively common thing that 

3943
02:58:14,281 --> 02:58:17,730
happens.
They go to Israel and they,

3944
02:58:17,820 --> 02:58:20,580
they think that they're like a messiah 
and they freak out.

3945
02:58:20,610 --> 02:58:22,500
They think that they're hearing the word
of god.

3946
02:58:22,501 --> 02:58:23,040
Right?
Isn't that,

3947
02:58:23,040 --> 02:58:25,870
am I reading this wrong?
Like a lot of people do this.

3948
02:58:26,430 --> 02:58:27,570
Yeah.
Like a couple of year.

3949
02:58:28,650 --> 02:58:29,483
Yeah.
And then they literally have a name for 

3950
02:58:30,451 --> 02:58:33,030
it called the jerusalem syndrome.
Here we go.

3951
02:58:33,510 --> 02:58:36,510
What does it say?
Or jeremiah says,

3952
02:58:36,511 --> 02:58:37,700
a group of,
uh,

3953
02:58:37,970 --> 02:58:38,803
a group of mental phenomena involving 
the presence of either religiosity 

3954
02:58:42,811 --> 02:58:44,820
themed,
obsessive ideas,

3955
02:58:45,060 --> 02:58:45,893
delusions or other psychosis like 
experiences that are triggered by a 

3956
02:58:50,821 --> 02:58:53,670
visit to the city of jerusalem.
Yeah.

3957
02:58:55,030 --> 02:58:56,130
Wow.
Wow.

3958
02:58:56,250 --> 02:59:00,390
It's not a demo to a single religion or 
denomination is affected jews.

3959
02:59:00,391 --> 02:59:03,090
ChrIstians and muslims have many 
different backgrounds,

3960
02:59:04,410 --> 02:59:06,660
but when they go to jerusalem,
that's what's really crazy.

3961
02:59:07,110 --> 02:59:09,150
Tourism wobble,
poison,

3962
02:59:09,240 --> 02:59:12,450
imagined.
Jerusalem really is a holy place.

3963
02:59:13,060 --> 02:59:16,770
I'll go there and only some people can 
hear the calling.

3964
02:59:16,771 --> 02:59:18,390
What if we're wrong?
We could be wrong.

3965
02:59:18,420 --> 02:59:20,370
We're arrogant left.
When you're telling us about this,

3966
02:59:20,371 --> 02:59:21,204
said that I feel like it.
They said that most of them were 

3967
02:59:22,261 --> 02:59:24,780
southerners from the us.
Of course they're the dumbest people,

3968
02:59:25,840 --> 02:59:29,500
but do you know about art?
Used to listen to you.

3969
02:59:29,910 --> 02:59:32,280
Do you know about the hookworm?
I can epidemic in the south,

3970
02:59:32,670 --> 02:59:33,503
yes,
and that's part of the reason that they 

3971
02:59:34,591 --> 02:59:38,070
were slow is because people in the south
all head hookworm will explain that.

3972
02:59:38,160 --> 02:59:39,870
This is recent.
Will you look this up please?

3973
02:59:39,871 --> 02:59:40,704
I listened to,
I think it was on how stuff works or 

3974
02:59:42,721 --> 02:59:43,800
something.
How?

3975
02:59:44,110 --> 02:59:44,943
Because of the heat and the way the 
south is so humid that hookworm was so 

3976
02:59:47,491 --> 02:59:48,324
prevalent.
They were founding hookworm and all of 

3977
02:59:49,231 --> 02:59:50,064
their feces and it eats away your brain 
and something like 70 percent of all 

3978
02:59:53,821 --> 02:59:56,910
southerners had hookworm until like the 
forties.

3979
02:59:57,440 --> 02:59:58,273
Jesus,
will you look that up and corroborate 

3980
02:59:59,791 --> 03:00:00,624
that so that I'm not just lying.
There is scientific explanation for 

3981
03:00:04,141 --> 03:00:05,310
southerners being slower.
Sorry,

3982
03:00:05,311 --> 03:00:06,180
southerners.
I love you.

3983
03:00:06,420 --> 03:00:06,930
Wow.

3984
03:00:06,930 --> 03:00:08,850
But some of them are super smartly.
Jimmy carter.

3985
03:00:09,020 --> 03:00:09,960
Well,
of course,

3986
03:00:10,020 --> 03:00:12,120
but like this is the,
you know,

3987
03:00:12,530 --> 03:00:14,790
and who was it?
Was it roosevelt who tried to.

3988
03:00:14,850 --> 03:00:15,720
No,
it was

3989
03:00:16,080 --> 03:00:17,480
rocks.
Weren't lazy,

3990
03:00:17,481 --> 03:00:18,314
just infected with hookworms.
A story of the postbellum south as told 

3991
03:00:22,341 --> 03:00:24,650
by parasites.
Holy shit.

3992
03:00:24,651 --> 03:00:26,290
Yeah.
It makes your teeth fall out and it eats

3993
03:00:26,291 --> 03:00:27,124
away.
Your brain got stereotypes are almost 

3994
03:00:28,430 --> 03:00:29,263
always the conclusion of lazy science.
They're just empirical generalizations 

3995
03:00:34,010 --> 03:00:34,843
that are stripped are the variances and 
encoded as fact into the collective 

3996
03:00:38,451 --> 03:00:40,670
consciousness of the general population 
to the,

3997
03:00:40,671 --> 03:00:41,510
to bubba bubba,
blah,

3998
03:00:41,511 --> 03:00:41,840
blah,
blah.

3999
03:00:41,840 --> 03:00:42,673
However,
sometimes the stereotype reveals a 

4000
03:00:43,821 --> 03:00:46,700
hidden truth that provides an origin to 
the myth.

4001
03:00:46,850 --> 03:00:47,683
The trope of the lazy southerner dates 
back to america's postbellum period 

4002
03:00:50,721 --> 03:00:54,080
following the end of the civil war.
No one really knows where it came from,

4003
03:00:54,081 --> 03:00:58,520
but the image of lethargic,
filthy drawing farmer has pervaded art,

4004
03:00:58,550 --> 03:01:02,440
literature and popular culture until up 
until this very moment.

4005
03:01:03,340 --> 03:01:05,770
So one argument recently published by 
rachel,

4006
03:01:05,771 --> 03:01:06,604
newer for pbs,
nova techs present some compelling 

4007
03:01:08,501 --> 03:01:09,334
evidence for the theory that a hookworm 
epidemic was responsible for the rural 

4008
03:01:13,421 --> 03:01:14,254
stereotype

4009
03:01:14,810 --> 03:01:19,180
shed laziness through the exhaustion 
mental fogginess attends to inflict upon

4010
03:01:19,181 --> 03:01:20,014
its victims.
Historical evidence shows that the 

4011
03:01:20,861 --> 03:01:23,260
parasite ravaged the american south 
route,

4012
03:01:23,261 --> 03:01:24,094
the early 20th century as a result of 
poor sanitation and lack of public 

4013
03:01:26,201 --> 03:01:29,380
health programs among the poor.
Crazy by 19 oh,

4014
03:01:29,381 --> 03:01:31,240
five,
the parasitologists,

4015
03:01:31,241 --> 03:01:34,990
that's a job.
I'm a joke.

4016
03:01:35,020 --> 03:01:38,580
Topologist charles says,
as we 40 percent or more,

4017
03:01:38,590 --> 03:01:39,820
not 60 percent,
I was wrong,

4018
03:01:39,821 --> 03:01:42,190
of the southern population,
was infected with hookworms.

4019
03:01:42,191 --> 03:01:43,024
The parasIte thrives and fecal matter 
and the combination of shoddy waste 

4020
03:01:45,061 --> 03:01:46,450
disposal.
In the rarity of shoes,

4021
03:01:46,720 --> 03:01:47,553
shoes,
no shoes allowed hookworm larvae to 

4022
03:01:49,361 --> 03:01:52,000
enter people's bodies through the 
webbing between their toes.

4023
03:01:52,001 --> 03:01:54,460
How fun.
Once they penetrate the skin,

4024
03:01:54,461 --> 03:01:55,294
they travel through their hosts,
lungs into their intestines where they 

4025
03:01:57,551 --> 03:02:00,280
survive on a diet of blood,
they suck out from the intestinal wall.

4026
03:02:00,281 --> 03:02:03,760
A female hookworm can lay up to 10,000
eggs in a single day,

4027
03:02:03,761 --> 03:02:04,594
which gives you an idea of how rampant a
localized infestation can become in a 

4028
03:02:07,421 --> 03:02:08,254
very short time.

4029
03:02:08,320 --> 03:02:09,153
The laziness that is synonymous with 
hookworm a hookworm infections is 

4030
03:02:12,080 --> 03:02:15,190
synonym of iron deficiency anemia.
Due To blood loss,

4031
03:02:15,191 --> 03:02:17,680
holy shit.
Getting bled out.

4032
03:02:18,280 --> 03:02:21,310
Forty percent of people were anemic and 
had blood loss.

4033
03:02:21,311 --> 03:02:22,640
the poor malnourished victims,
the paris,

4034
03:02:22,641 --> 03:02:24,580
I can cause stunted growth.
That's right.

4035
03:02:25,240 --> 03:02:26,073
Children with hookworms,
we're plagued with attention deficit 

4036
03:02:27,731 --> 03:02:28,564
disorders.
lower iq and the infected often had 

4037
03:02:30,131 --> 03:02:33,760
strange food cravings for dirt clay 
paper and chalk.

4038
03:02:34,570 --> 03:02:35,403
How nuts is that?
Southern states where the nexus of 

4039
03:02:36,701 --> 03:02:39,850
hookworm friendly climate is the 
parasite loved the sandy soil that makes

4040
03:02:39,851 --> 03:02:41,290
the real with the region.
So for at all,

4041
03:02:41,530 --> 03:02:42,363
in 1910,
seven point $5 million southerners had 

4042
03:02:43,631 --> 03:02:45,430
hookworms.
Oh my god.

4043
03:02:46,150 --> 03:02:47,490
that's insane.
Insane.

4044
03:02:47,980 --> 03:02:48,813
Yes.
the rockefeller is who donated money to 

4045
03:02:50,801 --> 03:02:51,634
try to combat it,

4046
03:02:52,250 --> 03:02:54,140
but that's the illuminati.
Isn't he like a.

4047
03:02:55,220 --> 03:02:57,040
Maybe this is all a scam.
Started

4048
03:02:57,120 --> 03:03:00,630
50 years for the worm to be eradicated 
from the south.

4049
03:03:00,650 --> 03:03:02,760
In 1960,
it was eradicated.

4050
03:03:03,150 --> 03:03:05,640
Oh my god,
because of the sanItation issues,

4051
03:03:06,130 --> 03:03:06,963
look at that.
Almost entirely freed from hookworms by 

4052
03:03:08,801 --> 03:03:10,090
1985.
Yeah,

4053
03:03:10,470 --> 03:03:12,540
that was 1:20
years ago.

4054
03:03:13,740 --> 03:03:15,900
So recently.
It's completely insane.

4055
03:03:16,140 --> 03:03:16,973
Is that nuts?

4056
03:03:17,000 --> 03:03:17,833
Well,
then add that to the fact that half the 

4057
03:03:18,891 --> 03:03:21,050
people in the country have 
toxoplasmosis.

4058
03:03:21,080 --> 03:03:21,913
What's that?
That's from cat parasites will know 

4059
03:03:23,610 --> 03:03:24,860
about that.
No,

4060
03:03:24,890 --> 03:03:27,200
this is a crazy one.
Most people,

4061
03:03:27,710 --> 03:03:30,980
if you're around for real,
If you're around like farm animals,

4062
03:03:30,981 --> 03:03:33,110
if you're around cats,
comedians,

4063
03:03:33,140 --> 03:03:34,770
comedians were all fairly.
If you,

4064
03:03:34,780 --> 03:03:35,670
you're around,
um,

4065
03:03:35,750 --> 03:03:36,583
any sort of feral cats,
it's a parasite that it only can 

4066
03:03:40,431 --> 03:03:44,030
sexually reproduce inside of cats gut.
So check this out.

4067
03:03:44,540 --> 03:03:45,373
They,
they,

4068
03:03:45,500 --> 03:03:46,333
these rats get it and it rewires the 
rats to make them sexually attracted to 

4069
03:03:50,841 --> 03:03:54,320
the smell of cat urine.
And the roads there.

4070
03:03:54,321 --> 03:03:55,154
Fear of cats.
So these rats literally get enlarge and 

4071
03:03:59,211 --> 03:04:00,044
some of them,
their ball swell up and their dicks get 

4072
03:04:01,461 --> 03:04:04,970
hard and they,
they go to find the rats and so,

4073
03:04:04,971 --> 03:04:07,070
or they go to find the cat's rather when
they go to find the cats,

4074
03:04:07,080 --> 03:04:07,913
they get killed.

4075
03:04:08,060 --> 03:04:12,380
The bacteria gets inside the cat.
And that doesn't seem to have any effect

4076
03:04:12,381 --> 03:04:13,214
on the cat,
but the cat shit has an effect on women 

4077
03:04:16,461 --> 03:04:20,150
in particular were they tell women like 
see how that rat is not scared,

4078
03:04:20,180 --> 03:04:21,013
not scared at all the cat.
And sometimes they chase cats and like 

4079
03:04:23,181 --> 03:04:24,890
jump adam and shit.
It's nuts.

4080
03:04:25,010 --> 03:04:27,340
See look.
So this is going to kill the rat though.

4081
03:04:29,080 --> 03:04:29,913
But the cat,
the rats not afraid it's running and 

4082
03:04:32,270 --> 03:04:33,103
then stopping like it doesn't,
it knows it's being chased but it's not 

4083
03:04:35,541 --> 03:04:40,100
like I have to get the fuck out of fear.
So it's not just,

4084
03:04:40,101 --> 03:04:40,934
it's fear.
It literally makes them sometimes 

4085
03:04:42,021 --> 03:04:44,300
sexually attracted to the smell of cat 
urine.

4086
03:04:44,690 --> 03:04:49,640
So then this parasite is toxoplasmosis 
gets inside the cat's gut,

4087
03:04:49,820 --> 03:04:50,653
the cat's shit it out.
And that's why they tell pregnant women 

4088
03:04:52,821 --> 03:04:54,620
to never touch litter boxes.

4089
03:04:54,950 --> 03:04:55,783
It's extremely important because it can 
be deadly to children and cause all 

4090
03:04:59,121 --> 03:04:59,954
sorts of birth defects.
But a crazy amount of people have it 

4091
03:05:02,690 --> 03:05:03,523
like maybe as many as 50 percent of some
countries that people have 50 million 

4092
03:05:08,421 --> 03:05:09,560
people in America.
Abbott.

4093
03:05:10,370 --> 03:05:11,203
I think that was the latest number.
See if that's the case number of people 

4094
03:05:14,061 --> 03:05:16,100
in America,
but it manifests itself.

4095
03:05:16,101 --> 03:05:17,720
Well,
it makes men reckless.

4096
03:05:17,721 --> 03:05:20,840
We had this guy dr robert sapolsky on 
the podcast.

4097
03:05:20,841 --> 03:05:23,300
Yes.
And robertson polsky's is fascinating.

4098
03:05:23,350 --> 03:05:24,410
Um,
scientists,

4099
03:05:24,650 --> 03:05:27,410
scientist and researcher,
and he spent a tremendous amount of time

4100
03:05:27,411 --> 03:05:28,244
studying toxoplasmosis and one of the 
things that he talked about how they 

4101
03:05:32,421 --> 03:05:36,650
found a disproportionate number of 
motorcycle accidents.

4102
03:05:36,920 --> 03:05:40,520
Whoa.
Where the person who died had toxo.

4103
03:05:40,730 --> 03:05:41,563
So they would do these tests.
One of these doctors told him when we 

4104
03:05:43,551 --> 03:05:45,620
would get a guy who died from motorcycle
crash,

4105
03:05:45,770 --> 03:05:46,603
we test them for toxo and it was a 
disproportionate number and they think 

4106
03:05:48,910 --> 03:05:50,690
toxo was making people reckless.

4107
03:05:51,170 --> 03:05:52,003
And there's also a connection in some 
strange way to soccer teams that are 

4108
03:05:55,641 --> 03:05:56,474
successful.
They find a disproportionate number of 

4109
03:05:58,641 --> 03:06:02,400
soccer teams that are successful.
The players test positive for toxins.

4110
03:06:02,430 --> 03:06:03,263
They're reckless in some way or they're 
fearless and it may in fact even raise 

4111
03:06:06,501 --> 03:06:09,190
testosterone and some males and it,
it made.

4112
03:06:10,040 --> 03:06:11,060
No,
no,

4113
03:06:11,090 --> 03:06:11,990
no.
It can't be cured.

4114
03:06:12,090 --> 03:06:13,760
So you can test yourself for it.
Yeah,

4115
03:06:13,850 --> 03:06:16,000
it's a part of,
you know,

4116
03:06:16,010 --> 03:06:19,730
literally on the front of every 
magazine.

4117
03:06:20,120 --> 03:06:20,953
Well,
um,

4118
03:06:21,080 --> 03:06:23,780
people like paul ski have only been 
studying it,

4119
03:06:23,781 --> 03:06:25,910
only been aware of it for the last 
couple of decades.

4120
03:06:26,150 --> 03:06:26,961
It's,
and you know,

4121
03:06:26,961 --> 03:06:27,794
as people who've grown up and talked 
about all the various factors for why 

4122
03:06:29,841 --> 03:06:30,674
people behave,
the way they behave is just recently 

4123
03:06:32,181 --> 03:06:33,830
coming into the realm of understanding.
It's not a,

4124
03:06:33,831 --> 03:06:37,430
it's not a real like,
well established fact for many,

4125
03:06:37,431 --> 03:06:38,300
many,
many years.

4126
03:06:38,480 --> 03:06:39,313
But so paul skis done a lot of 
incredible work on it and you can read 

4127
03:06:42,531 --> 03:06:44,570
his lecture or listened to his lectures,
rather read them.

4128
03:06:44,870 --> 03:06:48,980
In fact,
some of the shit that he probably,

4129
03:06:49,130 --> 03:06:50,420
I probably have it.
Yeah,

4130
03:06:50,510 --> 03:06:53,210
I've got a lot of feral cats.
I've had a lot of wildcats.

4131
03:06:54,130 --> 03:06:56,400
Yeah.
I lived with a wildcat flick seven years

4132
03:06:56,850 --> 03:06:59,580
and I had a couple of,
when I was growing up that were wild.

4133
03:06:59,640 --> 03:07:01,590
There was always living outside,
you know,

4134
03:07:01,591 --> 03:07:03,750
and who knows what the fuck they were 
getting outside when I was a kid.

4135
03:07:03,751 --> 03:07:05,340
My counts were always outside.
No,

4136
03:07:05,490 --> 03:07:06,323
my cat needs to bring home squirrels.
I just seen him walk across the street 

4137
03:07:08,671 --> 03:07:11,010
with a squirrel.
He be killed a squirrel.

4138
03:07:11,011 --> 03:07:11,844
He had it in his mouth and squirrels 
almost his size and he's literally 

4139
03:07:14,071 --> 03:07:15,470
walking across the street with 
squirrels,

4140
03:07:15,480 --> 03:07:16,313
body in between his legs.
He's dragging the squirrel across the 

4141
03:07:18,721 --> 03:07:20,580
street to show me that he killed the 
squirrel.

4142
03:07:21,330 --> 03:07:23,770
So he was probably out there killing 
rats kinds of things.

4143
03:07:24,250 --> 03:07:26,400
Smart.
Uh,

4144
03:07:26,440 --> 03:07:30,570
there's a great documentary on netflix 
about rats called rats.

4145
03:07:30,600 --> 03:07:31,433
What does It say here?
Morbid attraction to leopard urine in 

4146
03:07:33,631 --> 03:07:36,600
toxo plasma infested chimpanzees.
Yeah.

4147
03:07:36,780 --> 03:07:37,613
Seeing that the chimpanzees that are 
infected by toxo fuck with fuck with 

4148
03:07:42,960 --> 03:07:43,793
leopard.
So they can get killed because the toxo 

4149
03:07:45,061 --> 03:07:47,260
wants to grow inside the cat's gut.

4150
03:07:48,630 --> 03:07:51,120
Sexually,
sexually reproducing the crypt.

4151
03:07:51,210 --> 03:07:52,043
It is.
That's where it's actually reproduces 

4152
03:07:54,120 --> 03:07:56,570
inside the gut of cats.
It's the only way it's viable.

4153
03:07:56,880 --> 03:07:59,130
They stopped being afraid so they can 
basically,

4154
03:07:59,131 --> 03:08:01,350
they commit suicide,
not just be something afraid.

4155
03:08:01,351 --> 03:08:02,184
They're attracted to it.
It's drawn with them like they're like 

4156
03:08:05,910 --> 03:08:07,650
reckless.
People are attracted to danger.

4157
03:08:08,080 --> 03:08:11,890
A light.
That's my fucking mind blowing.

4158
03:08:12,380 --> 03:08:13,213
The parasites have some sort of innate 
intelligence that explained people who 

4159
03:08:16,891 --> 03:08:20,370
are just have a higher tolerance for 
danger and attraction to danger.

4160
03:08:20,770 --> 03:08:23,580
Yes,
probably probably addiction for sure.

4161
03:08:23,610 --> 03:08:25,110
There's got to be some kind of 
relationship.

4162
03:08:25,320 --> 03:08:27,900
We know so little.
Like when we learn,

4163
03:08:28,330 --> 03:08:29,163
we learn shit now it's like I remember I
get really bad migraines and I was in 

4164
03:08:32,610 --> 03:08:34,770
cedars getting morphine and I was just 
like,

4165
03:08:35,010 --> 03:08:35,761
when was this?
Oh,

4166
03:08:35,761 --> 03:08:36,594
I get gnarly migraines.
Oh you go to cedars and they shoot you 

4167
03:08:38,431 --> 03:08:39,264
up with morphine.

4168
03:08:39,570 --> 03:08:41,040
Says I got a headache.
I noW,

4169
03:08:41,041 --> 03:08:42,610
yes.
Which by the way I was on the,

4170
03:08:42,820 --> 03:08:45,860
the watchlist because drug addicts go in
there and they say like,

4171
03:08:45,870 --> 03:08:47,550
I have a migraine helped me.
So I was on a list.

4172
03:08:47,551 --> 03:08:48,630
They were like,
don't give it to her.

4173
03:08:48,631 --> 03:08:49,464
And they were like,
it's this whole thing if you go into 

4174
03:08:51,240 --> 03:08:53,000
frequently.
And uh,

4175
03:08:53,130 --> 03:08:56,220
I used to get really gnarly migraines 
and now I have like a whole system.

4176
03:08:56,221 --> 03:08:57,150
You know,
Michael Jackson,

4177
03:08:57,151 --> 03:08:59,950
dr.
I do see available.

4178
03:09:00,380 --> 03:09:02,490
I feel like he's on craigslist.
Oh,

4179
03:09:02,780 --> 03:09:04,710
that guy's in jail.
Told Michael Jackson,

4180
03:09:04,711 --> 03:09:06,420
you can't just kill the king of pop.
No,

4181
03:09:06,421 --> 03:09:10,110
you can't get away with that.
Is he in jail for life or a c and r?

4182
03:09:10,120 --> 03:09:10,953
Kelly's called now.
I think he's in jail for a wee bit 

4183
03:09:13,261 --> 03:09:14,720
though.
like a hot man.

4184
03:09:15,500 --> 03:09:20,010
That shit is [inaudible] or what was,
it was a profile when I froze my eggs.

4185
03:09:20,220 --> 03:09:21,760
They gave me that and I was like,
I got it.

4186
03:09:22,440 --> 03:09:25,440
He got out on parole.
He's not allowed to practice though.

4187
03:09:25,530 --> 03:09:26,670
Sure.
It's talking to me tonight.

4188
03:09:26,671 --> 03:09:27,504
It's got a podcast.
It's going to put me under to sleep and 

4189
03:09:29,461 --> 03:09:30,720
shit.
But I remember asking him.

4190
03:09:30,721 --> 03:09:35,721
I was high at least Michael Jackson died
doing what he loved sleeping.

4191
03:09:38,590 --> 03:09:39,510
um,
I,

4192
03:09:39,570 --> 03:09:40,590
uh,
one time was just like,

4193
03:09:40,591 --> 03:09:42,060
what causes migraines?
Like,

4194
03:09:42,120 --> 03:09:43,230
no,
they're like,

4195
03:09:43,231 --> 03:09:44,850
we don't know.
And I was like,

4196
03:09:44,851 --> 03:09:46,680
what do you mean you don't know?
And they're like,

4197
03:09:46,681 --> 03:09:48,090
there's just a lot we don't know about 
neurology.

4198
03:09:48,091 --> 03:09:49,420
I'm like,
what are you talking like?

4199
03:09:49,530 --> 03:09:50,970
And then I remember another doctor was 
like,

4200
03:09:50,971 --> 03:09:52,320
yeah,
that's why we call it a practice.

4201
03:09:52,940 --> 03:09:56,410
We're doing the best we can with what we
know.

4202
03:09:56,710 --> 03:09:57,543
So we don't call it space it out.
Like how often can you go in there and 

4203
03:10:00,101 --> 03:10:01,150
walk yourself to the moon?

4204
03:10:01,180 --> 03:10:03,220
I haven't had to do that for like a 
couple of years,

4205
03:10:03,420 --> 03:10:07,750
but when you go in they're like eee.
I think now it's a little bit better.

4206
03:10:07,751 --> 03:10:10,330
I don't go back to cedars because they 
were shitty about my ear surgery.

4207
03:10:10,720 --> 03:10:11,321
Uh,
what?

4208
03:10:11,321 --> 03:10:14,050
I have a tattoo here when we're attached
to my ear,

4209
03:10:14,080 --> 03:10:16,540
they were,
it just did not go particularly well.

4210
03:10:16,541 --> 03:10:20,110
The doctor was very dismissive to me.
So funny.

4211
03:10:20,111 --> 03:10:22,210
Is this an only an la thing?
They were like,

4212
03:10:22,211 --> 03:10:24,490
you're need a plastic surgeon.
Do you have one that you prefer?

4213
03:10:24,730 --> 03:10:25,610
Oh god.
I was like,

4214
03:10:25,660 --> 03:10:27,040
excuse first of all.
Thank you.

4215
03:10:28,000 --> 03:10:29,260
Second of all.
What the fuck?

4216
03:10:29,261 --> 03:10:32,680
Like I just have a plastic.
Is that only in la question?

4217
03:10:32,950 --> 03:10:33,790
Yeah,
I would imagine.

4218
03:10:33,791 --> 03:10:35,620
Have you ever gotten plan to get plastic
surgery on a,

4219
03:10:35,790 --> 03:10:37,200
a injury?
No.

4220
03:10:37,330 --> 03:10:37,931
Oh really?
Have,

4221
03:10:37,931 --> 03:10:38,764
you know,
you have to get a plastic surgeon if 

4222
03:10:40,391 --> 03:10:41,224
you're,
you're comes off.

4223
03:10:41,890 --> 03:10:42,723
I know dudes who have had their ears 
fixed where they had the cauliflower 

4224
03:10:44,381 --> 03:10:45,900
moved.
Oh,

4225
03:10:45,980 --> 03:10:47,140
that's hard to do though,
right,

4226
03:10:47,141 --> 03:10:48,940
because it's got nerve endings in it.
Well,

4227
03:10:48,941 --> 03:10:51,520
it's real tricky.
They have to delay your ear.

4228
03:10:51,940 --> 03:10:52,773
Oh,
I'm aware of peel it back and they have 

4229
03:10:54,041 --> 03:10:54,874
to pull the,
the calcium deposits out of the hard 

4230
03:10:57,341 --> 03:11:00,520
parts of your ear and had that on my 
nose.

4231
03:11:00,850 --> 03:11:01,760
Really?
Yeah,

4232
03:11:01,761 --> 03:11:03,500
and a lot of calcium deposits in 
segment.

4233
03:11:03,540 --> 03:11:04,373
Thank you for what you.
I mean I would assume it'd be a little 

4234
03:11:05,441 --> 03:11:08,410
more.
The inside was pretty fucked up until 10

4235
03:11:08,440 --> 03:11:09,650
years ago.
You have a thing in there?

4236
03:11:09,690 --> 03:11:10,451
No,
no,

4237
03:11:10,451 --> 03:11:12,760
but when I had a deviated septum 
operation,

4238
03:11:12,761 --> 03:11:16,180
they put these plastic stents in there 
and opened everything nice.

4239
03:11:16,360 --> 03:11:19,600
And they cut away the turbinates.
They cut away all this tissue.

4240
03:11:19,780 --> 03:11:23,350
They showed me all the tissue that was 
removed from my nose.

4241
03:11:23,350 --> 03:11:26,620
It was fucking crazy tissue.
It was like a.

4242
03:11:26,621 --> 03:11:27,454
Yeah,
a lot of scar tissue and a lot of when 

4243
03:11:29,111 --> 03:11:30,510
you get blood clots,
like,

4244
03:11:31,060 --> 03:11:34,480
like the same stuff that happens with a 
cauliflower ear,

4245
03:11:34,560 --> 03:11:35,393
but that is his blood leaking inbetween 
the tissue cells and then it stays in 

4246
03:11:39,821 --> 03:11:40,654
their pools up and then it calcifies and
when it calcifies it literally becomes 

4247
03:11:44,021 --> 03:11:47,470
like a rock and you can get that stuff 
in your nose too.

4248
03:11:47,590 --> 03:11:51,130
And some guys like it,
you get calcification in there and it,

4249
03:11:51,160 --> 03:11:51,993
it hardens up and,
and you also get a lot of scar tissue 

4250
03:11:54,820 --> 03:11:56,970
and it,
it closes up the um,

4251
03:11:57,090 --> 03:11:58,150
the,
the nose,

4252
03:11:58,210 --> 03:12:01,350
a window you can't breathe out of your 
nose happens.

4253
03:12:01,360 --> 03:12:04,480
So a lot of guys,
a lot of people that do fighting,

4254
03:12:04,481 --> 03:12:06,060
they talk,
like you'll hear them,

4255
03:12:06,070 --> 03:12:06,903
they have like a way of talking and 
that's why it's because they can't 

4256
03:12:09,581 --> 03:12:10,990
breathe through their nose.
Super,

4257
03:12:10,991 --> 03:12:12,940
super common.
But they can't.

4258
03:12:12,941 --> 03:12:14,910
Did you,
but you haven't done your areola?

4259
03:12:15,060 --> 03:12:16,510
No,
I never had it in my ears.

4260
03:12:16,511 --> 03:12:18,490
So I got a little,
I got little pieces in my ears,

4261
03:12:18,760 --> 03:12:22,060
but I always worked your guards.
This is important.

4262
03:12:22,061 --> 03:12:24,880
This helps you hear shit like all the 
stuff.

4263
03:12:25,050 --> 03:12:29,410
The design of the interface is fucking 
design of the ear though.

4264
03:12:29,411 --> 03:12:31,390
Particularly.
So like just take your ears.

4265
03:12:31,391 --> 03:12:32,270
That's what I was telling you.
Yeah.

4266
03:12:32,320 --> 03:12:36,340
Take your ear and then talk like this 
and then fold your year's over like that

4267
03:12:36,341 --> 03:12:37,060
and keep talking.

4268
03:12:37,060 --> 03:12:37,491
La,
la,

4269
03:12:37,491 --> 03:12:38,241
la,
la,

4270
03:12:38,241 --> 03:12:38,780
la,
la,

4271
03:12:38,780 --> 03:12:39,930
la,
la,

4272
03:12:40,020 --> 03:12:40,450
la,
la,

4273
03:12:40,450 --> 03:12:40,910
la,
la,

4274
03:12:40,910 --> 03:12:41,500
la.

4275
03:12:41,500 --> 03:12:42,333
It dulls the sound.
Now imagine if you have one rocks like 

4276
03:12:45,910 --> 03:12:49,660
literally randy coture way that the.
It's formed.

4277
03:12:49,990 --> 03:12:51,620
Well.
Mine is all fucked up now,

4278
03:12:51,621 --> 03:12:52,130
but you

4279
03:12:52,130 --> 03:12:53,740
can.
I guess I don't know the case.

4280
03:12:53,780 --> 03:12:56,090
Wouldn't you get cauliflower ear 
surgery,

4281
03:12:56,091 --> 03:12:58,820
but they can't.
An anesthetizing your ear actually hurts

4282
03:12:58,821 --> 03:12:59,654
more than just getting the surgery 
without anesthesia because they had to 

4283
03:13:02,061 --> 03:13:06,020
put anesthesia in the laceration.
I guess because the cartilage,

4284
03:13:06,021 --> 03:13:06,854
it doesn't spread as well.
So they did the reattachment surgery 

4285
03:13:09,441 --> 03:13:11,870
without anesthesia.
It was a fucking nightmare.

4286
03:13:12,410 --> 03:13:13,243
It was real as fuck.
And he was doing it and he wasn't 

4287
03:13:18,471 --> 03:13:19,400
listening to me.
You know,

4288
03:13:19,401 --> 03:13:21,580
surgeons can be kind of dismissive 
anyway because they're like,

4289
03:13:21,590 --> 03:13:22,850
god,
they think they're god.

4290
03:13:23,120 --> 03:13:23,811
And I was like,
sir,

4291
03:13:23,811 --> 03:13:26,240
can you please just give me a heads up 
of like when you're going to do that,

4292
03:13:26,360 --> 03:13:28,580
just would do it without telling me and 
I'm just like freaking out.

4293
03:13:29,450 --> 03:13:30,283
And I was like not being heard,
which was actually like triggering me 

4294
03:13:33,501 --> 03:13:35,360
emotionally.
Like I can deal with physical pain.

4295
03:13:35,450 --> 03:13:37,400
I was getting triggered.
I was like,

4296
03:13:37,401 --> 03:13:38,940
I need to know.
I mean heard.

4297
03:13:39,030 --> 03:13:40,940
He's like totally ignoring me.
Just like doing it.

4298
03:13:40,941 --> 03:13:43,190
I mean punching holes into my body,
like without,

4299
03:13:43,280 --> 03:13:44,930
I was like,
can I get like an honorary rafter three?

4300
03:13:45,380 --> 03:13:46,850
And then the next day my friend called 
to be like,

4301
03:13:46,851 --> 03:13:48,290
hey,
when can you come get her stitches out?

4302
03:13:48,291 --> 03:13:49,850
And the nurse was like,
oh the uh,

4303
03:13:50,090 --> 03:13:52,100
the surgeon can't talk on the phone,
he's deaf.

4304
03:13:52,970 --> 03:13:54,590
I got a depth surgeon and they just 
didn't even tell me.

4305
03:13:55,040 --> 03:13:56,750
I feel like you need to give someone a 
heads up on that.

4306
03:13:56,780 --> 03:13:57,613
You should definitely give her.
How the fuck is he going to know if he 

4307
03:13:59,870 --> 03:14:01,640
was screaming at him.
LIke,

4308
03:14:01,641 --> 03:14:03,050
sir,
can you please like give me a heads up?

4309
03:14:03,051 --> 03:14:03,500
And he just was

4310
03:14:03,500 --> 03:14:04,333
deaf.
I know a dude who got cauliflower ear 

4311
03:14:05,781 --> 03:14:06,614
and then somehow or another got a staph 
infection inside of his ear and it was 

4312
03:14:09,621 --> 03:14:10,454
so bad they had to remove his ear and 
they had a solder it because the 

4313
03:14:13,221 --> 03:14:14,054
infection was so prevalent.
It was constantly leaking fluid out of 

4314
03:14:17,061 --> 03:14:18,320
his ear.
What solder mean?

4315
03:14:18,470 --> 03:14:22,490
They had a fucking like do in the wild 
west movies where a guy gets shot,

4316
03:14:22,491 --> 03:14:23,600
they slap iron to it.

4317
03:14:24,500 --> 03:14:26,240
Oh god.
Cauterize.

4318
03:14:26,241 --> 03:14:27,860
It caught our eyes.
So the cauterize.

4319
03:14:27,861 --> 03:14:29,930
The inside of cold solder.
I'm being dramatic.

4320
03:14:29,931 --> 03:14:32,420
I don't know if they do that with a 
cleft palate.

4321
03:14:32,720 --> 03:14:34,360
Highrise.
The inside cauterize,

4322
03:14:34,410 --> 03:14:36,160
the smell cauterizing

4323
03:14:39,670 --> 03:14:41,230
and it didn't work.
They had to do it again.

4324
03:14:41,290 --> 03:14:42,370
Carla.
Just tricky.

4325
03:14:42,480 --> 03:14:44,440
You had to go in there more than once 
and cleaned it out.

4326
03:14:44,940 --> 03:14:45,773
Put shoot antibiotics in there because 
you can't fight with it or wrestle with 

4327
03:14:48,551 --> 03:14:52,990
it because it'll keep popping and had a 
staph infection inside of his ear.

4328
03:14:53,050 --> 03:14:55,390
That's good.
Which is super bad.

4329
03:14:55,420 --> 03:14:56,440
What does it.
These headphones.

4330
03:14:56,830 --> 03:15:00,550
Bone conduction headphones.
Good enough yet.

4331
03:15:00,620 --> 03:15:01,331
I don't know.
No,

4332
03:15:01,331 --> 03:15:02,080
I haven't.

4333
03:15:02,080 --> 03:15:03,650
That's what you're talking about.
The sound name.

4334
03:15:03,651 --> 03:15:04,840
You think of that their,
uh,

4335
03:15:04,870 --> 03:15:07,390
their headphones you put,
you put them on like headphones,

4336
03:15:07,391 --> 03:15:08,224
but they don't go in your ear.
They go on your ear and they vibrate in 

4337
03:15:13,030 --> 03:15:16,180
your jaw.
The sound literally as vibrant.

4338
03:15:16,181 --> 03:15:18,370
There's no sound coming out of them.
It's vibrations,

4339
03:15:18,371 --> 03:15:21,520
which is what sound is.
And it vibrates into your head,

4340
03:15:21,521 --> 03:15:23,880
not through your ear.
All this shit.

4341
03:15:23,920 --> 03:15:25,660
I went to sound audio engineering 
school.

4342
03:15:25,720 --> 03:15:27,190
He's very smart.
That,

4343
03:15:27,191 --> 03:15:28,570
um,
have you heard them?

4344
03:15:28,600 --> 03:15:28,900
Yeah,
yeah.

4345
03:15:28,900 --> 03:15:31,240
I was at the cs I went to a couple 
months ago.

4346
03:15:31,241 --> 03:15:33,280
I tested them out there,
but like they're coming out again.

4347
03:15:33,281 --> 03:15:34,870
There's a video going around where 
people are getting,

4348
03:15:34,871 --> 03:15:36,100
like,
amazed by how,

4349
03:15:36,520 --> 03:15:38,620
what it sounds like when you're putting 
something weird.

4350
03:15:38,710 --> 03:15:39,543
It's a very weird feeling because it's 
literally vibrating really small pulses 

4351
03:15:43,390 --> 03:15:44,320
on your skin.

4352
03:15:47,750 --> 03:15:49,980
It didn't sound bad.
You would fucking

4353
03:15:49,980 --> 03:15:52,320
love it.
What do you smoke some weed.

4354
03:15:52,350 --> 03:15:54,480
Go to a sound bath.
There's one in pasadena.

4355
03:15:54,510 --> 03:15:57,210
I just didn't want to in joshua tree.
it's like,

4356
03:15:57,360 --> 03:15:58,430
will you,
you'll,

4357
03:15:58,450 --> 03:16:00,930
you'll probably be better.
It's this guy that does bowls,

4358
03:16:00,931 --> 03:16:03,390
but it vibrates your entire body with 
sound.

4359
03:16:03,960 --> 03:16:06,000
And it's like this hypnotic you,
I mean,

4360
03:16:06,001 --> 03:16:07,080
I liked,
got paralyzed,

4361
03:16:07,081 --> 03:16:10,800
like I couldn't move my body.
It's so clean this place.

4362
03:16:10,801 --> 03:16:11,634
The way that they dome it and the way 
that the sound travels like renders you 

4363
03:16:15,091 --> 03:16:15,924
paralyzed.
It's like this insane out of body 

4364
03:16:17,641 --> 03:16:18,474
experience.
There's one of these places that's 

4365
03:16:19,351 --> 03:16:21,330
really famous.
That's in palm springs,

4366
03:16:21,331 --> 03:16:22,310
right?
Isn't it?

4367
03:16:23,040 --> 03:16:24,660
See that white one.
That's the one I went to.

4368
03:16:24,661 --> 03:16:28,020
That's in joshua tree.
There's something about joshua tree.

4369
03:16:28,021 --> 03:16:28,854
They say it has the most conductive 
sound or there's something about the 

4370
03:16:31,981 --> 03:16:34,620
electricity in the earth that makes it 
particularly powerful.

4371
03:16:34,620 --> 03:16:37,920
That's the one that I went to.
I mean I did some other good before.

4372
03:16:37,930 --> 03:16:42,270
how it was on a scale of one to snoop 
dogg was r kelly.

4373
03:16:43,220 --> 03:16:44,053
I was like.
And I was like a six out of 10 in 

4374
03:16:45,931 --> 03:16:49,230
hiGhness.
So you saw a concert inside?

4375
03:16:49,231 --> 03:16:50,770
There's one.
Actually I'm wearing a shirt of.

4376
03:16:50,950 --> 03:16:53,790
Oh,
concert.

4377
03:16:53,940 --> 03:16:55,050
Oh really?
Really special.

4378
03:16:56,810 --> 03:16:57,643
They had a screen up and they projected 
three d images on the screen and you 

4379
03:17:00,301 --> 03:17:02,730
couldn't take your cell phones.
And so it's really hard to find anything

4380
03:17:02,731 --> 03:17:03,780
about this.
But yeah,

4381
03:17:03,830 --> 03:17:06,780
it was a really cool experience.
It was the sound insane.

4382
03:17:07,080 --> 03:17:09,450
It was weird because it was all in,
it was different.

4383
03:17:09,451 --> 03:17:12,420
They had to spend some time figuring it 
out so it sounded good in there to enjoy

4384
03:17:12,421 --> 03:17:13,254
it as a concert.
So if You stand in the middle of the 

4385
03:17:14,971 --> 03:17:15,804
room,
you hear like waves just because of the 

4386
03:17:19,561 --> 03:17:21,980
way that there's like a hole in the 
ceiling and you just like hear this,

4387
03:17:21,981 --> 03:17:26,560
like it's oddly numbing and your skin 
starts tingling and you just go into the

4388
03:17:26,790 --> 03:17:27,750
hypnotic state.

4389
03:17:28,530 --> 03:17:29,363
I came out of it and I was like,
I had no idea if I was here for six 

4390
03:17:30,781 --> 03:17:32,220
hours or 10 minutes.
It was wild.

4391
03:17:32,221 --> 03:17:33,720
he was like,
no concept of time.

4392
03:17:34,710 --> 03:17:37,410
It was pretty awesome.
So it's doing something to you.

4393
03:17:37,440 --> 03:17:39,780
It's doing something.
W what's someone in pasedena?

4394
03:17:39,810 --> 03:17:42,160
That's the one I want to try.
Um,

4395
03:17:43,320 --> 03:17:44,153
but I'm super into it,
super into it and I'm like not like a 

4396
03:17:46,921 --> 03:17:48,870
lay on the ground with strangers type of
person.

4397
03:17:48,871 --> 03:17:52,950
So those are the bowls that he rubs.
Soundbath center.

4398
03:17:53,130 --> 03:17:54,810
what's the science of it though?
Oh,

4399
03:17:54,811 --> 03:17:55,644
there's one in eagle rock,
same science that makes crystals really 

4400
03:17:59,910 --> 03:18:00,900
dirty feet.
See,

4401
03:18:00,901 --> 03:18:02,430
I don't do.
I'm not a crystal.

4402
03:18:02,431 --> 03:18:04,590
Are you on the crystal tip or you're 
into crystals.

4403
03:18:04,980 --> 03:18:07,080
Crystals happening.
That's salt lamps,

4404
03:18:07,081 --> 03:18:08,790
but they just look cool.
Oh,

4405
03:18:08,791 --> 03:18:10,250
you don't do this because it's like,
no,

4406
03:18:10,260 --> 03:18:11,100
I don't think they do anything.

4407
03:18:11,100 --> 03:18:16,100
That one doesn't even have a light bulb 
in my house and I don't even know why.

4408
03:18:17,730 --> 03:18:21,090
I do have those lights that are sunlight
replicates sunlight and make serotonin.

4409
03:18:21,091 --> 03:18:22,980
Happy roads.
I have those in my house.

4410
03:18:23,070 --> 03:18:23,903
I always wonder if like maybe some of 
the positive energy in this room is 

4411
03:18:26,101 --> 03:18:28,500
because of that salt lamp.
Very good vibe in here.

4412
03:18:28,501 --> 03:18:31,230
I'm worried about you getting a new 
studio called studio.

4413
03:18:31,490 --> 03:18:32,660
This energy.
It's very good,

4414
03:18:32,730 --> 03:18:36,520
but you're replicating this size.
That's awesome.

4415
03:18:36,600 --> 03:18:39,090
Almost exactly the same.
This amazing tv is a little bigger.

4416
03:18:39,490 --> 03:18:42,720
I like that same desk.
This desk has like.

4417
03:18:42,721 --> 03:18:47,450
I like how life like intimate as it is.
yes.

4418
03:18:47,590 --> 03:18:48,170
All right.

4419
03:18:48,170 --> 03:18:51,780
We're done too much.
We've talked for three and a half years.

4420
03:18:51,781 --> 03:18:54,250
I know how we always do crazy.
Crazy.

4421
03:18:54,430 --> 03:18:56,080
But your book is out.
Tell everybody about your book.

4422
03:18:56,400 --> 03:18:57,670
I wrote a book,
buy it.

4423
03:18:57,910 --> 03:18:59,580
Go buy that book pitch.
All right.

4424
03:18:59,910 --> 03:19:00,770
Thank you.
