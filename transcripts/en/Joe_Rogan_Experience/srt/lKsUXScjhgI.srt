1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,720
Where's the real captain?
Live would live.

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:04,170
Who is the real captain?
Man?

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:09,200
I'm.
We're talking about the new star trek 

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,931
versus the oldest.
This is shade grown men do in their 

5
00:00:11,931 --> 00:00:13,020
spare time.
Testing flat cap.

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,900
Is that Echo in New Mexico?
Yes.

7
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:16,750
My,
uh,

8
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,340
shirt.
A new Eva Cerveza.

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,870
You don't that New Mexico might be the 
only shape of a state that sort of makes

10
00:00:24,871 --> 00:00:26,550
sense.
It's fucking square.

11
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,130
Basically Square.
It's square,

12
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:34,310
but like it looks like on the bottom.
Some dudes just had some 

13
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:34,770
miscommunication.
Like fucking do that.

14
00:00:34,771 --> 00:00:37,720
You're supposed to be over here.
That's Mexico miscommunication.

15
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,190
Oh,
the lives that Mexico wanted,

16
00:00:41,191 --> 00:00:44,400
like there must have been like a cool 
elk hunting spot probably.

17
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,830
And a New Mexico is like,
oh,

18
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,460
we gotta have a story about a need.
This little area,

19
00:00:50,461 --> 00:00:55,461
this little block off in that corner.
Mexico know New Mexico is like the one 

20
00:00:55,461 --> 00:00:57,370
of the premier elk hunting spots in the 
country.

21
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:02,930
Different.
Like when I was a kid in Michigan we 

22
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:03,060
went whoa.
And maybe but not at all when I was like

23
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,250
12 or something,
stuff changed.

24
00:01:05,251 --> 00:01:09,630
And because elk used to be not hunted 
and then they opened up a season,

25
00:01:09,631 --> 00:01:14,631
I'm so fucking elk,
you could like walk up to a herd of 100 

26
00:01:14,631 --> 00:01:18,981
deep and there would be.
I remember there'd be centuries they 

27
00:01:18,981 --> 00:01:20,430
would post like young bull elks all 
around the perimeter.

28
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:24,510
And it was fucking wild dude.
They were almost tame.

29
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,220
And then the year after they opened up 
permits is skiddish as white tail deer.

30
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,880
Really crazy.
One of the best hunting experiences I 

31
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:34,880
had there.
Uh,

32
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,370
I was in like a pit blind with a bowl 
and there were a bunch of dough at the 

33
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:44,090
feed pile.
And then as in this big field and I hear

34
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:49,110
like come through the woods.
And then another group and these elk met

35
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:54,120
two bowls and they started smashing 
horns and I was fucking blown away.

36
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,460
The deer didn't give a shit.
They're like,

37
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,010
just eating whatever.
Not even our species.

38
00:01:59,011 --> 00:02:00,500
We're good.
And um,

39
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,650
it was awesome,
man.

40
00:02:01,651 --> 00:02:02,260
It was,
it was.

41
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,410
I loved growing up in the woods or Rad 
man.

42
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,860
It's so cool that you got into hunting 
in your deep,

43
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:08,670
deep,
deep in it.

44
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:11,000
Like there's nothing better than 
obsessed,

45
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:14,910
but it's the elk thing is so strange.
The noises they make,

46
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:18,780
like when we were a hunting Colorado,
when the female see they bark.

47
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,540
That's awesome.
Like everybody know,

48
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:25,620
let everybody know so open.
There's all that huge tracking.

49
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,280
Like you got to be an athlete,
New Mexico and Colorado.

50
00:02:29,281 --> 00:02:34,281
It's a different kind of.
Well Colorado where we were was in the 

51
00:02:34,281 --> 00:02:37,131
mountain,
so it's all trees and stuff and it was 

52
00:02:37,131 --> 00:02:37,740
all about hiding behind trees and 
bringing them to you and being on a,

53
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,410
on a,
on a run or something.

54
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,090
Yeah.
Yeah.

55
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:45,150
Trying to be near where they are and 
since it's the raw you tryna make 

56
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:45,150
noises,
you know,

57
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:49,941
like cow calls or you're trying to bring
them in while you're trying to sneak 

58
00:02:49,941 --> 00:02:50,010
off.
Don't piss all over you.

59
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,980
Is that the new shit?
Okay.

60
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:56,240
I was listening to this podcast.
Uh,

61
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,040
it's a Ted Ted talk podcast and I don't 
know if you've ever seen

62
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:05,040
that video,
but there's a video that got around 

63
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,200
about when they reintroduced wolves to 
yellowstone park.

64
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,570
Yep.
But do you,

65
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,720
you can't hunt in yellowstone park.
So the animals in yellowstone park or 

66
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,190
the same way that you were talking about
those elk,

67
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:17,280
the elk are the same way.
Like they somehow or another know that 

68
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:17,560
people are not gonna hunt them.

69
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,290
That's the weird thing about it and how 
it changed in one season.

70
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:26,291
I'm like,
how are they all symbiotic in this way 

71
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:28,160
where they all communicate because none 
of them had been hunted.

72
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:30,680
And it's like all of a sudden all the 
fucking elk new though.

73
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,000
Yeah,
it's wild.

74
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:33,050
They,
uh,

75
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,250
I mean,
you know what it's like,

76
00:03:34,251 --> 00:03:36,080
I think,
you know how uh,

77
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,460
is there something wrong?
You know what it's like a,

78
00:03:38,461 --> 00:03:43,461
you know,
how you see birds when they fly and 

79
00:03:43,461 --> 00:03:45,050
those big or schools of fish,
schools of fish,

80
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:50,110
when they'll turn on a dime,
the flocks just know where everybody's 

81
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:50,870
going.
It's weird.

82
00:03:50,871 --> 00:03:53,660
There's some sort of strange 
communication telepathy.

83
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:57,230
And I think that you read that book,
the rise of Superman.

84
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:58,610
No,
I haven't heard.

85
00:03:58,611 --> 00:03:59,720
It's awesome though.
Awesome.

86
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:04,800
And they talk about,
I think the movie was transformers that 

87
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:04,830
all these dudes in wing suits went off 
the.

88
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,920
Is it the sears tower in Chicago?
And make an almost 90 degree banks and 

89
00:04:11,411 --> 00:04:16,411
stuff and then if and there are four of 
them and they're following each other 

90
00:04:16,411 --> 00:04:18,160
and if one guy goes after I see you 
move,

91
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:23,310
I'm too late,
I have to move as you're moving around 

92
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:23,440
inside ruined the air flow and all that.
And then I hit the building.

93
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,630
These guys practicing the Alps and they 
talked about that,

94
00:04:28,631 --> 00:04:31,960
that you need to be in that flow state 
and that you can start to work with each

95
00:04:31,961 --> 00:04:36,961
other in a way that is a supernatural,
which is crazy because I felt that flow 

96
00:04:37,301 --> 00:04:42,070
state as a singular person in different 
events in my life,

97
00:04:42,071 --> 00:04:47,071
but like that kind of thing where 
they're working in tandem with each 

98
00:04:47,071 --> 00:04:50,521
other and they're all talking to each 
other and I think like that's the way 

99
00:04:50,521 --> 00:04:50,521
that that fish move or that's the way 
like,

100
00:04:50,521 --> 00:04:55,320
you know,
what is it that gives a frog the fence 

101
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:55,870
to jump off the lily pad right as the 
Hawk is diving before the Hawks moved or

102
00:04:55,871 --> 00:04:56,350
whatever.

103
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:58,390
Like what?
Like all those fish,

104
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,240
it's not like one turns in the rest 
follow up.

105
00:05:00,241 --> 00:05:02,290
They all move uniformly,

106
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:07,890
the schools of fish efficient.
The flocks of birds are so magical when 

107
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:11,071
you watch them dance in the sky.
That was giant flocks of birds like how 

108
00:05:11,071 --> 00:05:12,610
are,
how are they not just slamming heads,

109
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:13,510
how,
how,

110
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:14,640
what is going on there,

111
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:18,420
and then the hawks that birds of prey 
are so different than that,

112
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:19,890
you know?
No,

113
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,350
no flocks of that meat is a different 
kind of thing.

114
00:05:22,351 --> 00:05:25,400
It does people.
Yeah.

115
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:28,590
Those are those seed eating birds are 
the ones that can do that.

116
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:29,820
They're like,
we really need each other.

117
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:31,640
The ones that are mediators are like,
I'm good.

118
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:37,050
This the same tent talk.
This guy was talking about how a humans,

119
00:05:37,311 --> 00:05:39,680
it was a different guy was st podcast 
though,

120
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:44,800
was talking about how humans interrupt 
the natural symphony of nature and that 

121
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:50,980
this symphony,
there's like there's a frequency that 

122
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:53,981
all these different animals operate at.
There's like a frog has a niche in this 

123
00:05:53,981 --> 00:05:58,121
frequency and a bird has a niche in this
frequency and they were talking about 

124
00:05:58,121 --> 00:06:02,200
one frogs.
When you have like a whole like swamp 

125
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,360
filled with Brady predators would also 
does.

126
00:06:05,361 --> 00:06:10,361
It makes it impossible to locate them 
because there's so much sound coming 

127
00:06:10,361 --> 00:06:11,690
from so many different places.
It's you can't find them,

128
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,720
but they have these low flying jets in 
this area because this is a place where 

129
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:21,850
they practice or pilots practice fighter
fighter pilots and so they fly these 

130
00:06:22,191 --> 00:06:27,191
jets like 600 meters above the ground.
It's pretty low and they age,

131
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:29,510
they fucking supersonic speeds.

132
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:34,510
They're fucking just going crazy over 
the swamp and the disruption of sound is

133
00:06:35,451 --> 00:06:40,451
so intense that everything stops for a 
while and then slowly these frogs start 

134
00:06:42,531 --> 00:06:44,710
to resynchronize,
so like one one,

135
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,990
one will read it and then they'll try to
find each other and get into that rhythm

136
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:50,120
again.
But when that happens,

137
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,600
when they're trying to find that rhythm,
that's when all the hawks,

138
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,190
all the owls and all the coyotes know 
exactly when to move in.

139
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:02,690
So they move in then and they start 
picking apart all these frogs.

140
00:07:02,691 --> 00:07:05,810
They find the frogs and they eat them.
It's really interesting,

141
00:07:05,811 --> 00:07:09,860
like they know that there's like a 
disruption in the frequency.

142
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:15,090
Wonder how the like.
So are those predation animals working 

143
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:16,280
on a different frequency than the frogs 
then are like,

144
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:21,360
they're,
they're opportunists in this way where 

145
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:21,360
they're like,
this is a tie,

146
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:21,360
you know?

147
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:21,630
Yeah.
That must be opportunist I think.

148
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:24,410
I mean,
I think the whole idea of what he.

149
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:28,230
The way he was describing it though,
the way the frogs do it where you know,

150
00:07:28,231 --> 00:07:30,840
like you're in the swamp or something 
like that and you hear frogs,

151
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:36,410
you didn't know where the fuck there are
so many of them sometimes what it is 

152
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:36,960
like,
they sound fucking crazy.

153
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,340
Yeah.
There's so many of them.

154
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:43,910
And so when they have to kind of find 
each other and because the sound is so 

155
00:07:44,821 --> 00:07:46,200
intense,
when the jet flies over,

156
00:07:46,201 --> 00:07:48,470
everybody stops what they're doing.
And so they're like,

157
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,310
we doing this,
we're doing this,

158
00:07:50,311 --> 00:07:51,110
we doing this,
we did,

159
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,200
let's do it,
let's do it.

160
00:07:52,201 --> 00:07:53,730
And how long does it take them to 
recalibrate?

161
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:55,050
It wasn't,
it wasn't long.

162
00:07:55,051 --> 00:07:56,270
It was only a few minutes.
It was like,

163
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:59,390
I think I want to say 15 minutes where I
might be.

164
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:02,580
I might be mistaken,
but it was less than an hour and in that

165
00:08:02,581 --> 00:08:06,690
time these trying to get their shit back
together again and they just get jacked.

166
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:12,390
That's the thing about us humans being 
the disruption is that even though like 

167
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:16,630
what we think of our.
I read something somewhere,

168
00:08:16,631 --> 00:08:20,290
I heard a podcast where they're like,
there's a kid or somebody that developed

169
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:25,550
a bacteria or a some kind of biome that 
that will eat plastic and maybe take 

170
00:08:27,281 --> 00:08:30,790
care of the big island of plastic or 
whatever.

171
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,740
And I started thinking about that.
I'm like,

172
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:37,180
we're fucking idiots.
Like we created plastic.

173
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:39,370
Like that was our solution then to,
you know what I mean?

174
00:08:39,371 --> 00:08:43,480
It's like we,
we put nuclear reactors on the biggest,

175
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:46,900
a fault line in the world where it's the
most active.

176
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:50,210
Like that's how smart we are.
And like,

177
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,840
what do you do when you create a 
bacteria or something that will eat?

178
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:55,200
What happens when all the plastics gone?
Like is like,

179
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,000
was that like

180
00:08:56,110 --> 00:09:01,110
the introducing,
oh we've got a rabbit problem in 

181
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:01,230
Australia,
let's get a Fox and then we've got a Fox

182
00:09:01,231 --> 00:09:01,770
problem.
You know,

183
00:09:01,771 --> 00:09:03,450
it's like fun.
It's Australia.

184
00:09:03,451 --> 00:09:04,870
Australia is crazy.
Yeah.

185
00:09:04,871 --> 00:09:07,290
My Buddy Adam will learn from anything.
No.

186
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,880
What are the most adaptable creature and
we're like,

187
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,160
let's go ahead and get some.
We got a desert.

188
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:13,680
Get the golf courses out here.
Let's go ahead and do that.

189
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,510
Well,
that was what was interesting about this

190
00:09:15,511 --> 00:09:19,230
Ted podcast is this same guy who was 
talking about the wolves.

191
00:09:19,231 --> 00:09:21,360
Who's done that video but the wolves in 
yellowstone.

192
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,590
It's really interesting because he's 
got.

193
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:27,740
He's got an English accent.
He asked about the wolves in yellowstone

194
00:09:28,441 --> 00:09:30,590
and amazing things have happened.
This.

195
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:35,610
This guy's crazy though because he 
didn't just want to bring wolves back to

196
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:40,640
yellowstone.
Now he's talking about bringing mega 

197
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,810
fauna to England.
See they did these studies where they 

198
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:48,510
dug deep into the ground and they found 
fossilized remains from 10,000

199
00:09:48,511 --> 00:09:52,740
plus years ago of lions and elephants.

200
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,800
This crazy fucker is talking about 
reintroducing lions to England.

201
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:02,931
We need that.
But what was interesting about this cat 

202
00:10:02,931 --> 00:10:06,860
is that he admitted that this all this 
fascination with wolves and everything 

203
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:09,300
came out of a midlife crisis.
He's like,

204
00:10:09,301 --> 00:10:12,180
he went into a midlife crisis and then 
uh,

205
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:17,270
his,
his solution was to get a pussy and now 

206
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:17,840
my spirit animals will.
Exactly,

207
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:23,410
exactly.
So this dude got like really super and 

208
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:26,971
the wolves and super into the idea of 
what he calls rewilding,

209
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:33,260
but the thing is like he was talking 
about how megafauna used to live in 

210
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:36,930
England and that human predation and all
that stuff wiped them out,

211
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:42,350
but that hasn't been proven that they 
don't know that for a fact that it is 

212
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:46,290
entirely possible that the climate was 
just not the best climate for them.

213
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,320
And then also natural disasters.
And then also the absolute fact that 90 

214
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:54,690
plus percent of everything that has ever
lived ever is extinct.

215
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:59,740
Right?
So this guy's idea of reducing don't 

216
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,090
want to kill nothing,
don't want to let nothing die.

217
00:11:00,091 --> 00:11:05,091
We are the ultimate pussy arrogant 
fuckers that are building golf courses 

218
00:11:05,091 --> 00:11:05,520
and deserts.
It's crazy.

219
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:06,960
Well,
the wolf thing is so fast.

220
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,690
So there's both sides of that.
I've heard both,

221
00:11:09,691 --> 00:11:11,760
like it's awesome that we have wolves 
again there.

222
00:11:11,761 --> 00:11:16,761
And then I've heard people are like,
this is really the decimation of an 

223
00:11:16,761 --> 00:11:17,790
environment like this change the 
environment and the topographical,

224
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:23,160
a makeup of yellowstone so much that we 
were retarding growth and a lot of ways 

225
00:11:23,971 --> 00:11:25,440
are all like.
I mean,

226
00:11:25,441 --> 00:11:27,420
anytime you ready to do something,
there's an alteration,

227
00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:29,400
but like is it for the good or the bad?
Well,

228
00:11:29,401 --> 00:11:31,920
it's good for some species.
It's really good.

229
00:11:31,921 --> 00:11:35,120
For some birds it's really good for 
some,

230
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,380
a lot of different kinds of plants and 
trees.

231
00:11:37,381 --> 00:11:42,381
It's really good for trees because 
yellowstone had such a huge population 

232
00:11:42,381 --> 00:11:44,430
of deer and elk and bison and all these 
different animals.

233
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:49,430
They were just eating the shit out of 
all the grass and the trees got thicker 

234
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,540
and they're,
they grew taller,

235
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:54,430
like within six years they grew much,
much taller.

236
00:11:54,431 --> 00:11:55,050
It's part of the,
uh,

237
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,200
the Ted talk.
This guy gave and the root system got 

238
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:00,760
stronger because the root system got 
stronger.

239
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:03,900
The path of the rivers was,
was,

240
00:12:03,901 --> 00:12:07,330
yeah,
it changed and it was really,

241
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:10,510
really intense.
So it is good for some animal.

242
00:12:10,511 --> 00:12:13,420
It's not good for the deer,
but,

243
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:16,450
but do they take those anyway?
Would Rangers go out and be like,

244
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:19,720
we need to take 50 zero this year?
Or like there was no hunting.

245
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:24,870
I don't think there was any hunting,
but they do in certain circumstances in 

246
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:27,991
places where there's no hunting,
they will bring in people to kill the 

247
00:12:27,991 --> 00:12:29,140
population if it gets too high and pick 
what?

248
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:34,290
Yeah,
but the solution to that is allow 

249
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:35,530
hunters to go into yellowstone,
but the problem with that of course,

250
00:12:35,531 --> 00:12:38,230
is it yellowstone national park people 
were out there hiking and shit.

251
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:40,500
You don't want Yahoos out there shooting
a gun.

252
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:45,550
Just have rangers and he'd be like,
the session is closed and make sure 

253
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:45,550
there's no campers.
Go through it.

254
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:45,760
All that.
Yeah.

255
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:50,880
It's hard though.
I mean how many animals and animal can 

256
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,610
give birth to and if there's no wolves 
like.

257
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,840
And it's like,
that's the other thing about hunting.

258
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:59,770
One of the things you realize is how 
much woods there really are,

259
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:04,800
how deep the everyone's talking about 
the human beings have absolutely taken 

260
00:13:05,981 --> 00:13:07,930
over big parts of this country.
Right?

261
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:09,640
Southern California.
I mean,

262
00:13:09,641 --> 00:13:13,230
you go around Los Angeles area,
like the wildlife that used to be here,

263
00:13:13,231 --> 00:13:18,231
it's all been pushed out,
but there's still areas that are 

264
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:18,231
insanely wild and yellowstone is one of 
them.

265
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,990
I mean there's a lot of wilderness

266
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:25,170
when I fly from here to New Mexico,
it's like fly over New Mexico and 

267
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:25,600
telling me like there's just no land 
anymore.

268
00:13:25,601 --> 00:13:29,020
It's like there's fucking no people 
living anywhere and most of that state,

269
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,700
like it's just that something happened 
and there's a fucking mountain lion that

270
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:37,060
stocked and hunted.
One of my friends,

271
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:42,450
I'm in Hollywood in the Hollywood hills.
She was at a party like fourth of July 

272
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:47,251
or something,
parked your car on a little cul de sac 

273
00:13:47,251 --> 00:13:47,251
house.
The people are gone on vacation.

274
00:13:47,251 --> 00:13:51,841
Some really rich folks up in the hills.
She walks down and she and two friends 

275
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,380
and fucking car and there's a fucking 
mountain lion that's there that they are

276
00:13:56,381 --> 00:13:58,300
in the Culdesac,
the mountain lions here and it's.

277
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:03,360
There's nowhere to go.
There's a fence into the fucking crazy 

278
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:03,360
story.
So anyway,

279
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,890
she ends up yelling at it,
scaring and jumping on top of this audio

280
00:14:06,891 --> 00:14:10,240
or some car that was there that was 
parked there screaming at it.

281
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,330
And um,
and then that stopped at,

282
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,500
stopped it from advancing,
but still the extra,

283
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:15,820
I was like,
what sounds did it make?

284
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:16,450
And she was like,
oh,

285
00:14:16,451 --> 00:14:18,510
it was like,
it was like a beast from a move.

286
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:22,960
It was crazy just talking to her and um,
but you would think

287
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,010
if that was the case,
it might've been cornered and it wasn't,

288
00:14:27,011 --> 00:14:28,390
it was cornering them.
Yeah.

289
00:14:28,391 --> 00:14:30,810
But why would it cornered them and just 
growl at them?

290
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:33,070
Delphy

291
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,760
no idea,
but made itself known.

292
00:14:35,761 --> 00:14:38,640
She jumped the fence,
tried to break the windows of the house,

293
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,570
got a nine one one call out was sketchy 
service.

294
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,710
Thanks a lot.
And t

295
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:45,590
and uh,
and uh,

296
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,130
so I switched to verizon at and t 
they're just not reliable mountain lions

297
00:14:50,131 --> 00:14:52,010
hunting friends were one.
I want

298
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:52,880
to switch it to.
They go,

299
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,020
they go,
well,

300
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:57,620
were you using your phone in a high a,
in a high traffic zone?

301
00:14:57,621 --> 00:14:59,090
Like I'm like a high traffic.
So I'm like,

302
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:01,710
are you just telling me you oversold 
your system and that like,

303
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:06,720
I can only call it certain times because
you charged me every minute of the 

304
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:06,720
fucking day.
Anyway,

305
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,290
I digress.
Um,

306
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,160
and then the phone call dropped.
It was awesome.

307
00:15:10,161 --> 00:15:11,270
I was in the verizon store.
I was like,

308
00:15:11,271 --> 00:15:16,271
this is a phone call dropped to the t 
guy while you were in the verizon store 

309
00:15:16,271 --> 00:15:18,410
and the AP and t guy goes,
no,

310
00:15:18,411 --> 00:15:19,550
my battery went dead.
I'm like,

311
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,750
motherfucker,
you're in,

312
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,160
you're the,
you're a tech Geek.

313
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:22,700
Like,
you know,

314
00:15:22,701 --> 00:15:23,720
your shit is bunk,
you know,

315
00:15:23,721 --> 00:15:24,740
on the street,
your friends laugh.

316
00:15:24,741 --> 00:15:25,130
They're like,
oh,

317
00:15:25,131 --> 00:15:28,370
you're slang that att and t shirts,
you know that fuck off.

318
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,630
Come on.
Just tell me.

319
00:15:29,631 --> 00:15:30,900
It's funny,
you know it's funny.

320
00:15:30,901 --> 00:15:31,430
He's like,
no,

321
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:32,600
I don't understand what you mean.
So I'm like,

322
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:35,120
I can't even talk.
That's baby powder cocaine.

323
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,180
Stop all that.
Stop Light Shit.

324
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,220
Anyway,
the line was tagged.

325
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:45,490
Oh yeah.
That's why she didn't get charged with 

326
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:47,411
like an attempted breaking and entering 
and all this shit from security cameras 

327
00:15:47,411 --> 00:15:47,411
on them because they knew where the line
is like yeah,

328
00:15:47,411 --> 00:15:52,061
the line fucking was done and I'm like,
so you got taglines that are in high 

329
00:15:52,061 --> 00:15:54,080
density population,
but like right in downtown Hollywood.

330
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,440
Yeah.
We're super awesome.

331
00:15:55,441 --> 00:15:57,980
Super Arrogant about mountain lions in 
California.

332
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,600
You can't hunt mammoth mountain lions.
They're not hunted.

333
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,710
Right.
So because of that,

334
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:05,670
their population has skyrocketed in this
place that I'm going to to hone ranch.

335
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:09,960
There's one waterhole that they have 
where they took pictures of 16 different

336
00:16:09,961 --> 00:16:12,870
mountain lions.
I mean they have a massive population of

337
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:15,450
animals up there because it's 270,000
acres.

338
00:16:15,451 --> 00:16:17,220
Whose ranch is it?
Privately owned?

339
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,490
Privately owned,
giant ranch and they,

340
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:25,510
it's just huge and there's nothing going
on up there other than hunting and some.

341
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:31,660
I think they have a water pipeline goes 
through it and a bunch of other ways 

342
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:35,661
they make money off the ranch,
but it's not like there's a lot of 

343
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:35,661
people there.
There's,

344
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:40,660
it's very,
very few people go in and out of the 

345
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:43,791
ranch.
So these fucking cats have the run of 

346
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:46,071
the land and there's elk up there and 
there's deer up there and there's a lot 

347
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:46,440
of pigs up there and they just party.

348
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:50,380
I want to put Gopros on him.
All came back like a fucking stock.

349
00:16:50,381 --> 00:16:55,381
It like be bad ass.
Why do I think someone did something 

350
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:56,180
like that recently?
They put a Gopro on something.

351
00:16:56,210 --> 00:17:01,210
Those aren't those park rangers.
They're not fulfilling their fucking 

352
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:01,210
need.
If they're not dark,

353
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:03,080
those things put Gopros on them and 
let's walk.

354
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,600
Well,
how long will the battery last?

355
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,640
I don't know man.
They need to get in there.

356
00:17:06,641 --> 00:17:10,670
Figure it out.
Let's go do something for this world.

357
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:15,910
You've got a battery that'll never 
fucking disintegrate and that we're 

358
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:18,281
going to keep around forever.
That's polluting the environment for 

359
00:17:18,281 --> 00:17:20,471
sure.
But you can't get that on a mountain 

360
00:17:20,471 --> 00:17:20,800
lion.
Come on entertainment.

361
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:25,810
At least I think that there's going to 
be in the future there's going to be 

362
00:17:26,151 --> 00:17:27,860
batteries.
It just don't run out of juice.

363
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:30,500
Like we're going to look back 100 years 
from now.

364
00:17:30,501 --> 00:17:35,501
They're going to laugh at us like piles 
and batteries and landfills and 

365
00:17:35,501 --> 00:17:39,461
hopefully we get to the place where we 
can be laughed at hopefully if we make 

366
00:17:39,461 --> 00:17:43,271
it right.
And that's the thing is I think we get 

367
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:43,271
just smart enough.
I mean he say it all the time,

368
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:47,261
just smart enough to where we can.
We can go ahead and have our own 

369
00:17:47,261 --> 00:17:49,830
destruction because of our progress 
because we won't stop progress.

370
00:17:49,831 --> 00:17:50,220
It's like,

371
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,050
is that weird thing?
It's like that thing.

372
00:17:52,051 --> 00:17:55,020
I think Duncan was talking about the 
Elon Musk put $10,000,000

373
00:17:55,021 --> 00:18:00,021
towards like this is going to guard us 
in the future against the rise of the 

374
00:18:00,021 --> 00:18:01,830
machines type shit.
He wanted to stop artificial until,

375
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:06,890
well,
he wants to protect us or at least 

376
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:07,810
analyze artificial intelligence.
That's the thing is like any pro,

377
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:10,980
show me where progress got halted.
It's like progress.

378
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:13,100
It just spurts.
It's like a weed,

379
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:14,630
you know,
my boss,

380
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:19,760
my hope about progress is they figured 
out a way to make no residue like that.

381
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:22,400
No footprint.
Well,

382
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:25,680
not like there's no waste,
like the idea of like,

383
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:28,230
like right now we create pollution.
Right?

384
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:30,360
But we had that,
how did we have that?

385
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:31,690
Did you ever read,
uh,

386
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:37,060
that Goddamn book about food anyway?
And,

387
00:18:37,911 --> 00:18:38,380
and it,
it,

388
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:43,390
it,
it surveyed three different meals and 

389
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:46,251
one was like a fast food meal and other 
was like a all organic home cooked meal 

390
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:46,920
and another was a meal that you made 
everything,

391
00:18:46,921 --> 00:18:49,230
like you made the flower,
you harvested the yeast,

392
00:18:49,231 --> 00:18:50,910
you did all that kind of stuff.

393
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
And uh,
it was the Omnivore's dilemma was the 

394
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:56,000
name of it.
And,

395
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,680
and like farms used to be like that,
like you'd have some sheep and some pigs

396
00:18:58,681 --> 00:19:02,670
and some chickens and they would shit 
all over here and you'd be growing wheat

397
00:19:02,671 --> 00:19:07,671
or corn or whatever over here.
Then they'd move over here and then you 

398
00:19:07,671 --> 00:19:08,760
move your crops over here.
And so you had a continual fertilization

399
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,940
and um,
and self utilized farm.

400
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:15,510
And then we moved all the animals off 
the farm and put them in feed lots.

401
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:18,750
And then now we just grow one crop over 
and over again.

402
00:19:18,751 --> 00:19:20,280
So we need to have.
Yeah.

403
00:19:20,281 --> 00:19:21,700
But even if they're doing that,
they're,

404
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:26,730
you're still using farm equipment.
The farm equipment had to be built 

405
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:28,230
somewhere.
The construction materials,

406
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,640
there's residue,
there's,

407
00:19:29,641 --> 00:19:31,270
there's waste,
there's,

408
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,440
there's all sorts of pollution that 
comes out of the machines themselves.

409
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,960
There's some people that are trying to 
figure out a way how to take carbon 

410
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,220
dioxide out of the atmosphere and 
utilize it.

411
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:46,430
How to take waste,
like what are all the different waste 

412
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:46,770
products that people create with all the
different things that we do,

413
00:19:46,771 --> 00:19:51,771
whether it's making computers or whether
it's driving buses are and figuring out 

414
00:19:51,771 --> 00:19:56,160
a way to turn that waste into something 
profitable or into something useful.

415
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,820
Had to be Hella profitable.
Well,

416
00:19:57,821 --> 00:19:59,760
I'd have to be held you useful too,
right?

417
00:19:59,761 --> 00:20:04,761
Like that's the idea behind this.
The plastic island in the ocean,

418
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:06,990
how to utilize that.
It's not really an island.

419
00:20:06,991 --> 00:20:11,991
People who get mad if you call it an 
island because you can't build a house 

420
00:20:11,991 --> 00:20:11,991
on it.
Exactly.

421
00:20:11,991 --> 00:20:13,020
We can't sell real estate on that,
so fuck you.

422
00:20:13,021 --> 00:20:16,680
It's not that.
That figure is on environment though.

423
00:20:16,681 --> 00:20:19,060
Like what do we call it?
It's a floating,

424
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:22,170
floating,
like the size of Texas.

425
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,880
They don't even know how big it is 
really.

426
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,180
It's just like how all the plastic finds
each other.

427
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,980
Everybody wants even plastic.
That's beautiful.

428
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,880
Love Story.
Plastic plastic should be one of those 

429
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,900
little 15 minute shorts before you watch
a kids meal.

430
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:41,280
You know what dude,
that's what I need to do.

431
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:45,210
All this other shit.
I need to get a job with like Chevron or

432
00:20:45,211 --> 00:20:48,010
something or the plastic companies and 
I'll be the guy that goes out there.

433
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:51,510
I remember when we were filming two guns
and I was like in Louisiana and,

434
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:54,280
and that fucking,
they just fucked up the whole golf.

435
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:56,650
So way to go.
You were there when that happened?

436
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:59,890
It was right after that.
And so there's just no,

437
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:02,500
I didn't go down.
That wasn't like that right there.

438
00:21:02,501 --> 00:21:07,501
I wasn't on the shores.
But like how far away were you were in 

439
00:21:07,501 --> 00:21:07,501
New Orleans and how far away is that 
from them?

440
00:21:07,501 --> 00:21:11,590
One and I don't know,
not to bad river runs out into it.

441
00:21:11,591 --> 00:21:14,410
And you didn't smell anything crazier,
but I mean no more.

442
00:21:14,411 --> 00:21:16,090
I mean you want to smell is fucking 
weird.

443
00:21:16,091 --> 00:21:18,390
You know,
there's a lot of new smells to me like I

444
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,990
go to.
I went to Bourbon Street and I was like,

445
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:25,680
this is just like,
and they got everybody at Walmart 

446
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,410
hammered and brought a party bus and 
drop them off.

447
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,820
And that's what Bourbon streets like.
It's a trip permit.

448
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,610
Awesome.
It's fucking crazy.

449
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:34,540
And then it feels like you walk back all
through that quarter and you're like,

450
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,590
it's all misty and shit and you're like,
this is where Jack the ripper lips,

451
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:41,350
like it's fucking hot as fuck back 
there.

452
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:46,430
And there's tranny,
hookers and fucking all kinds of 

453
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:46,430
darkness all through there.
It's a trip.

454
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:51,130
There's,
bp is doing all this shit and they're 

455
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:53,581
going look at what we've done to help.
Like I could be one of those spin 

456
00:21:53,581 --> 00:21:53,980
doctors for the,
for the,

457
00:21:53,981 --> 00:21:54,670
uh,
plastic.

458
00:21:54,671 --> 00:21:57,270
Gosh,
look at the love and plastic help is.

459
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,540
It was awesome.
I was like,

460
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:00,490
I really believed these guys.
These are great commercials.

461
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:05,820
I look up even though we've dumped 
millions of gallons,

462
00:22:06,071 --> 00:22:07,390
like Halliburton,
they can be like,

463
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:10,680
look at all these dead Iraqis and look 
at what we've done to help them.

464
00:22:10,681 --> 00:22:13,570
And they could show them Baghdad like 
five years ago in Baghdad now.

465
00:22:13,571 --> 00:22:17,920
And it's a little different just to be 
like New York City now.

466
00:22:17,921 --> 00:22:18,610
It's caves.

467
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:25,190
Well,
we're trying to do is we start from 

468
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:27,471
scratch and then do it right and do it 
right.

469
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:33,500
You know,
that is one of the arguments that 

470
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,841
historians use,
like it's in the beginning of a Dan 

471
00:22:35,841 --> 00:22:37,350
Carlin's hardcore history series on the 
Mongols.

472
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,630
Did you listen to that?
You know what he's talking about?

473
00:22:39,631 --> 00:22:44,631
Hitler and the beginning of the thing.
He was talking about how the way people 

474
00:22:44,631 --> 00:22:48,351
talk about gang is calm today.
They say that he opened up the trade 

475
00:22:48,351 --> 00:22:51,951
routes with China and all the things 
they tried to put a positive spin on 

476
00:22:51,951 --> 00:22:53,940
what he did.
But the reason why they could do that is

477
00:22:53,941 --> 00:22:56,210
because it was a thousand years ago.
Right?

478
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:59,280
But if they try to do that about Hitler,
it's too soon.

479
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:01,470
He's like,
it's an interesting thing that people do

480
00:23:01,471 --> 00:23:03,150
when it comes to history.
Hashtag.

481
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:06,820
Hashtag.
Hashtag too soon.

482
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:08,070
Hashtag blessed.

483
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,580
Yeah.
Every revolution starts with the fight.

484
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:16,010
Yeah.
I learned that today on the UFC,

485
00:23:16,011 --> 00:23:20,330
a promo for Rhonda and Holly.
You know,

486
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,920
if you've seen the thing that they've 
done.

487
00:23:21,921 --> 00:23:24,530
Well actually I can't talk about it.
I don't think I cried.

488
00:23:24,531 --> 00:23:29,531
I cried when I saw it was so good.
It was great fucking promo work for 

489
00:23:29,531 --> 00:23:31,130
that.
For Holly and Ronda fight.

490
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:31,770
Oh,
the one with the.

491
00:23:31,771 --> 00:23:34,520
It shows him as little girls coming up 
and you cry.

492
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:35,440
Oh Dude.
What is,

493
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:40,540
you know what broad Yvonne is when holly
as a little girl is sitting in church 

494
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,930
and all the people that are looking at 
her,

495
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,990
cause she's got bought fucking and it 
looks up and she's got a black eye.

496
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:46,190
She kind of gives that smile

497
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:51,310
and I'm like.
And what made me cry as like the pride 

498
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:51,470
of a black eye like that people don't 
have,

499
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:52,410
you know,
like there's,

500
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:57,440
there's,
there's not a lot of people that will 

501
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:57,440
know what that is like to be proud.
Like she worked for that black guy.

502
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,630
You know what I mean?
It's like I would look at a girl with a 

503
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:03,461
black guy and think that she got beat by
her man and that's what a lot of people 

504
00:24:03,461 --> 00:24:03,800
don't think that way.
I don't see color Joe,

505
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:09,020
that's not a colored,
but I think that's a male female.

506
00:24:09,021 --> 00:24:12,560
It's a gender.
Be that aggressive.

507
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:19,670
It isn't funny thing left Jamie.
It is a funny thing,

508
00:24:19,671 --> 00:24:20,210
man.
If you,

509
00:24:20,211 --> 00:24:22,040
if you train a lot of you have a black 
guy.

510
00:24:22,041 --> 00:24:23,560
It's kind of a badge of courage.
Oh,

511
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:28,840
was like cauliflower ear.
Somebody asked me what the fuck was 

512
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:28,840
wrong with my hair.
I'm like,

513
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:29,920
what's wrong with yours?
It's a mansion.

514
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,410
When I uh,
when I,

515
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:34,700
one time I had a,
like a serious black.

516
00:24:34,701 --> 00:24:36,970
I actually had two black eyes and I was 
uh,

517
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:39,230
on fear factor and I was like,
look,

518
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:42,140
just just let me do the show with black 
guys who gives a shit.

519
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:43,550
Right?
They brought it in because I didn't wear

520
00:24:43,551 --> 00:24:46,160
makeup on fear factor,
but during that I did.

521
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:49,160
They brought in a makeup artist.
I spray person.

522
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,310
How people don't want to be authentic.
They were like,

523
00:24:52,311 --> 00:24:55,250
we can't have this be real.
We need to have it look a certain way.

524
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:57,290
The way we think of him to look.
It's like,

525
00:24:57,291 --> 00:24:58,700
how about you?
I look like me.

526
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:01,430
It's great.
It's like all that shit about the camera

527
00:25:01,431 --> 00:25:03,200
puts on 10 pounds or whatever 
motherfuckers.

528
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:06,320
It makes you look exactly like you are.
You're not happy with that.

529
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:08,480
Don't be so fat.
I don't have to tell her.

530
00:25:08,481 --> 00:25:10,650
Understood.
That camera puts rounds thing.

531
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,250
I look in the mirror,
I look at myself on camera.

532
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,400
Right.
It's exactly the same.

533
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:18,430
Similar care we put on 10 pounds.
What it.

534
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:19,920
Where's that coming from?
Oh good.

535
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:25,170
Is that like the old cameras?
Maybe so maybe like them old with some 

536
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:27,140
kind of flux lens.
Maybe like a circus lens.

537
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,850
Maybe.
It was like before the head Hd.

538
00:25:28,851 --> 00:25:29,600
You can.
Funny Man,

539
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:34,720
you know when I was on news radio just 
people are pussies and they'll make any 

540
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:34,720
excuse to not have it be real.

541
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,170
Like it's not my fault.
I don't.

542
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:38,560
I don't need to be accountable for that 
camera.

543
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:43,660
Really good shape.
It's just this one time in my gut when I

544
00:25:44,421 --> 00:25:49,421
was on news radio,
it was right when they were introducing 

545
00:25:49,421 --> 00:25:50,900
hd cameras and I'll tell you,
man,

546
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:53,160
actresses were shitting their pants.
Really?

547
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,100
It was crazy.
Yeah.

548
00:25:55,101 --> 00:26:00,101
They were like,
they'd have conversations in the makeup 

549
00:26:00,101 --> 00:26:02,351
room,
like when need a lot more of this was 

550
00:26:02,351 --> 00:26:03,941
the hd cameras come holy.
They were all scared because you could 

551
00:26:03,941 --> 00:26:07,091
have a girl.
Does makeup people like to be scared 

552
00:26:07,091 --> 00:26:07,091
anymore?
Like created.

553
00:26:07,091 --> 00:26:07,610
There wasn't a makeup people.
It was the actresses actresses,

554
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:12,600
but they were almost signed.
Mom sound mind stable.

555
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,030
They knew that they look better on tv 
than they did in real life.

556
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:19,700
Look at David Caruso and Oh Geez.
In real life.

557
00:26:19,701 --> 00:26:20,890
It's like,
holy fuck.

558
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:23,600
Real life.
He looks like a Zombie Dude and 106.

559
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,570
Yeah.
At least 100,

560
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:28,390
606 with some real diet.
Real crypt keeper shit.

561
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,080
Yeah.
He swings kettlebells.

562
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:33,670
Does he know that guy?
He's like,

563
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:35,750
is he a smoker?
Is that what it looks like?

564
00:26:35,751 --> 00:26:37,500
You must be,
but he's also redheaded.

565
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:40,760
He's got that bill bird shit,
but bill per looks great.

566
00:26:40,761 --> 00:26:42,650
Looks really good.
He looks healthy as fuck.

567
00:26:42,651 --> 00:26:45,730
He's got the thing too about facelifts,
like he's like,

568
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:46,280
yeah.
He's like,

569
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:51,290
I'd rather look like is.
It was like I'd rather look like a 40 

570
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:55,530
year old guy that a 29 year old lizard 
or they don't have that shit worked out.

571
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:57,360
What are you doing pulling your face 
straight like that?

572
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:02,400
It is awesome.
There's this lady at my daughter's 

573
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,530
gymnastics class who's got monster face.
I call it monster face.

574
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:06,330
When those poor ladies,
they do their lips.

575
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:11,760
They shoot rubber into their face to 
fucking fill it up and then they pull 

576
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,780
that bitch back and then she's monster 
face.

577
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:13,420
Like you look at it,
you,

578
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:15,670
oh Jesus,
like you can't like.

579
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:19,140
But meanwhile she's right next to a 70 
year old lady who looks fine.

580
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,040
You know,
you look at her,

581
00:27:20,041 --> 00:27:20,790
you go,
hello,

582
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:23,490
how you doing?
Like you don't get weirded out at all.

583
00:27:23,491 --> 00:27:27,080
You just looking at an older woman.
Age Ism is a weird thing and that you.

584
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:30,660
The self talk that happens around it 
that people do is like,

585
00:27:30,661 --> 00:27:33,690
it's a fucking trip.
Like what people run from in that way.

586
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:39,170
It is.
Well it just feels like there's 

587
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:39,170
something they don't do the shit that 
would do it.

588
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:39,540
It's like,
don't you want to move?

589
00:27:39,541 --> 00:27:44,541
Well all the time,
don't you want to fucking like be able 

590
00:27:44,541 --> 00:27:44,541
bodied and all?
No,

591
00:27:44,541 --> 00:27:44,541
no,
no.

592
00:27:44,541 --> 00:27:45,770
But I could get some surgery to do 
something like fuck.

593
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,620
Well they just want to look good.
Right?

594
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:50,610
Like there's some people that look good 
until their face moves,

595
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:55,870
like they can convince themselves they 
look good because they're like looking 

596
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:56,970
in the mirror and then everything looks 
okay as long as they stay still.

597
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:58,830
But once they start talking and you go,
hey,

598
00:27:58,831 --> 00:28:00,910
you're fucking cheeks are moving man.
Right.

599
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:03,970
Like one time we were in the green 
facial expression.

600
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:09,170
We were in the green room at the Improv 
and Breyer in this member when Joan 

601
00:28:09,541 --> 00:28:14,541
rivers and her daughter had like a 
reality show and I was high as anyone 

602
00:28:14,541 --> 00:28:16,580
wondering who do I want to fuck her 
daughter?

603
00:28:16,581 --> 00:28:16,850
No,
no.

604
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:21,970
Oh,
that's how either one of those were an 

605
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:24,600
option,
but I was looking at we will really,

606
00:28:24,601 --> 00:28:29,601
really high.
It was me and des and you know how that 

607
00:28:29,601 --> 00:28:29,601
goes.
So we're,

608
00:28:29,601 --> 00:28:30,230
we're in the,
in the green room and we were looking up

609
00:28:30,231 --> 00:28:34,170
at the screen and I couldn't,
I was freaked out.

610
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:38,370
I mean just like nervous and terrified 
at Joan rivers face because her face was

611
00:28:38,371 --> 00:28:40,710
like a rubber Kabuki mask.
Absolutely.

612
00:28:40,711 --> 00:28:42,040
As if,
when you're looking at it,

613
00:28:42,041 --> 00:28:47,041
you're like,
it looks like somebody is about to 

614
00:28:47,041 --> 00:28:47,041
explode.

615
00:28:47,041 --> 00:28:49,730
It looks like there's an impending 
something happening and you're not sure 

616
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:49,730
what,
but it's like,

617
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:53,061
it's so fucking not right.
But let's just looked frozen.

618
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:58,250
It looked like frozen and rubber and 
weird and she died getting operated on.

619
00:28:58,321 --> 00:29:00,030
Right.
It wasn't surgery though.

620
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:03,210
I don't think it was plastic surgery.
Is that how Kanye his mom died too?

621
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:05,970
I think so.
I think she died from plastic surgery.

622
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:09,690
Anesthesia going,
they're going under for hundreds.

623
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:15,060
No bullshit.
It's weird that we live in such an 

624
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:15,060
advanced society,
but they're like,

625
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:15,060
just putting people to sleep.
We might kill him.

626
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,260
Bono.
It's so rare though.

627
00:29:16,261 --> 00:29:18,080
It's you have to be a poor health to go 
on.

628
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:23,280
Gone under a bunch of times for 
surgeries and I've had both my knees 

629
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,660
done one knee twice my nose.
Done,

630
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:30,140
I've got a lot of shit fixed and they,
they just put you under in the front 

631
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,830
like you never hear of a fighter when 
they go under.

632
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:36,480
It's usually older people.
What have you had done?

633
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:39,660
My knee.
My shoulder three times.

634
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:40,400
Damn.
Yeah,

635
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:41,680
you shoulda done times.

636
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:44,970
I was overachiever.
They did.

637
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:50,940
They sculpt it first and then I rip that
one out and then they did another one 

638
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:55,381
where it was a real aggressive thing 
that changed my anatomy around in that 

639
00:29:55,381 --> 00:29:58,321
shoulder and then like they like your 
bicep head goes in and they cut off the 

640
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:03,720
bone where it goes in on one of them and
they moved it and screwed it in 

641
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,920
underneath to be like a physical blocks.
So when it dislocate,

642
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:10,590
which then you fast forward 15 years 
later and I was having a lot of ac joint

643
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:15,810
hurt like trouble and there's just 
rubbing together and so this other 

644
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:20,371
doctor,
he goes in and he's going to clean that 

645
00:30:20,371 --> 00:30:20,371
up and he says,
it'll be great.

646
00:30:20,371 --> 00:30:20,371
Awesome.
He looks at my x rays.

647
00:30:20,371 --> 00:30:20,830
He goes,
oh my God,

648
00:30:20,831 --> 00:30:22,090
who did this to you?
And I go,

649
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,840
that's not very encouraging.
He goes,

650
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,340
just nobody ethically would change your 
anatomy like that,

651
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:31,330
like this.
And I was like,

652
00:30:31,331 --> 00:30:34,630
it was a cutting edge shit at Michigan 
State University fucking 15 years ago.

653
00:30:34,631 --> 00:30:36,440
Like,
I dunno why,

654
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:40,090
but it's been solid since then.
That's my good shoulder.

655
00:30:40,091 --> 00:30:41,930
So that guy do it again.
Uh,

656
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:45,190
that guy just cleaned up my ac joint.
That was forest surgery.

657
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:47,550
So when they cleaned it up,
like what do they do?

658
00:30:47,551 --> 00:30:51,420
Like my friend Melissa from the UFC,
she's had her shoulder done,

659
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:52,560
she has a,

660
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:57,740
they shave it,
they put some kind of fake synovial 

661
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:58,650
fluid maybe back in it.
They try to influence a

662
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:02,220
cartilage growth.
Perhaps hers was bone growth,

663
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:04,680
like when you have like any sort of an 
issue,

664
00:31:04,681 --> 00:31:08,250
like a lot of arthritis and rubbing,
like you see that a lot,

665
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:13,280
a lot of time in spinal stenosis,
around the spinal columns you'll see 

666
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,710
growth like on the edges of the,
uh,

667
00:31:15,711 --> 00:31:17,990
the spine of the discs.
Well,

668
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,590
not on the disc itself,
but the,

669
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:24,700
the hard pieces,
the spine and the disc is the stuff in 

670
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:24,700
between these times.
Yeah.

671
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,640
And the um,
what do they call those things?

672
00:31:26,641 --> 00:31:29,100
What's the spine bone?
What's a bone?

673
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,350
I think we did spine bone,
spine.

674
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,710
I know just what you're talking about is
the,

675
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:37,710
your backbone because in between the 
semipermeable like pumice creek,

676
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:43,380
that's the mushy stuff.
And that's the stuff to cushions 

677
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:43,380
everything.
Right?

678
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:47,150
And the bulk of your vertebrae.
Thank God very much.

679
00:31:48,751 --> 00:31:50,190
Jamie.
I knew there was a word.

680
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:53,490
How do you remember that?
Seems like that's in my lexicon,

681
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,860
but I've had a rough day.
I've been running around.

682
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:58,680
But the um,
the edges as you,

683
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:02,610
your disks get smaller if they,
if you're losing disc degeneration.

684
00:32:02,611 --> 00:32:03,480
Right?
And by the way,

685
00:32:03,481 --> 00:32:07,680
a lot of doctors will start to tell 
people that it's disc degeneration,

686
00:32:07,681 --> 00:32:09,540
disease and they'll let you know that,
oh,

687
00:32:09,541 --> 00:32:11,250
it's a disease.
You don't have to worry about it.

688
00:32:11,251 --> 00:32:12,570
Right?
Its use,

689
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:15,330
its use.
It's not a disease for the most part.

690
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:20,360
It's most of the time when they say that
what it is is you've been abusing your 

691
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,780
body because I've talked to a bunch of 
fighters and they'll say,

692
00:32:21,781 --> 00:32:22,980
well,
it's degeneration,

693
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:24,750
just desta generation disease.
I'm like,

694
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:30,110
oh,
well it has nothing to do with you 

695
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:31,371
fucking headbutting dudes.
One hundred miles an hour like shooting 

696
00:32:31,371 --> 00:32:34,251
for doubles and run it into people's 
hips suplex to over and over again or 

697
00:32:34,251 --> 00:32:34,740
tossed or whatever.
This isn't.

698
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:36,020
This isn't a disease.
We're talking.

699
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:38,530
This isn't herpes concussion,
this is your,

700
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,280
you're beating fuck out of your body,
man.

701
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:44,900
But I'm the edges.
They develop like bone spurs,

702
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:49,970
like the bone tries to grow and almost 
like your bone is trying to fill in the 

703
00:32:50,091 --> 00:32:54,080
area where it knows that the spinal disc
isn't there anymore.

704
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:56,440
It's weird how your body fights for 
homeostasis.

705
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,460
No matter what,
like going into that,

706
00:32:58,730 --> 00:32:59,870
that's like they said,
my shoulder,

707
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:04,880
there's no scar tissue and this one,
that's probably what keeps it from 

708
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,050
getting dislocated.
The scar tissue keeps it in place.

709
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:08,300
Wow.
I got to get on that,

710
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:10,410
on that.
Uh,

711
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:11,870
stem cell shit dude.
Stem.

712
00:33:11,871 --> 00:33:16,871
So Shit is the Vegas.
You've still got to give me that guy's 

713
00:33:16,871 --> 00:33:16,871
info.
Oh yeah.

714
00:33:16,871 --> 00:33:20,921
Well that's Dr Davidson from the UFC is 
the one who connected me with the 

715
00:33:20,921 --> 00:33:23,350
people,
but do they?

716
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:28,470
They've done a bunch of people now,
a bunch of UFC people have staggering 

717
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:28,470
results.
Yeah.

718
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:33,041
You're saying Roy Nelson did his knee or
Daniel cormier is knee stem cells.

719
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:36,650
If either of those guys at Aka,
I would just do every joint.

720
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,140
Just even if there's no problem,
I'll be like,

721
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:40,180
I,
you were the coach you back,

722
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,380
just get in there and just do it.
But that's what Ludwig did.

723
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,890
Pretty low.
Preemptively got both shoulders done.

724
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:47,990
I think he did his hips to.
Dude,

725
00:33:47,991 --> 00:33:52,991
I can't imagine the fuck.
He's such a savage and the whole knits 

726
00:33:52,991 --> 00:33:53,540
for somebody like that.
Like him,

727
00:33:53,541 --> 00:33:57,470
like Winkeljohn should do that too.
Like you beat the fuck out of yourself.

728
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,060
Brandon Gibson,
all those guys.

729
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:03,110
You professional holder,
that's worse than fighting.

730
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:03,960
Yeah.
Yeah.

731
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:05,720
For your shoulder.
Don't health.

732
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:10,780
That's horrible.
Especially if you're holding mitts for 

733
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:10,780
some fucking.
For Jon Jones.

734
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:11,390
Come on.
Well Jon Jones hits hard,

735
00:34:11,391 --> 00:34:13,380
but like imagine like,
like,

736
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:16,070
like travis brass guys are Travis 
Browne,

737
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:19,090
allister,
allister.

738
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:23,690
Especially allister when he was on this.
I don't know if that's true or not.

739
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:27,260
I believe it's true.
I believe it was proven.

740
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:30,610
I don't know what you're saying is so 
dumb.

741
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:33,620
That drug shit fucking stupid.
You know,

742
00:34:33,621 --> 00:34:38,621
when I was in high school I had to write
a paper and the paper that I wrote was 

743
00:34:38,621 --> 00:34:41,861
that you should legalize every drug and 
and I was all the kind of thing,

744
00:34:42,211 --> 00:34:43,320
a 13 year old,
right?

745
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:45,020
I was all hyped up on,
on,

746
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:50,100
on Nwa Gangsta rap and I was like,
how in the fuck did easy Egan oozy?

747
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,810
Like he doesn't look like anybody that 
should have Uzi.

748
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:56,730
That's true is because he can sell to 
end.

749
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:58,760
The black market is the only thing that 
makes crime.

750
00:34:58,761 --> 00:35:00,500
I'm like,
why do we have a black if they want to.

751
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:05,890
But that's the thing is like everybody 
is all fucking excited about marijuana 

752
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:07,400
being you all plots.
Everybody's a fucking pussy.

753
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:10,610
You're out there like look at and smoke 
a joint on CNN.

754
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:13,670
Well guess what?
You still got fucking 500,000

755
00:35:13,671 --> 00:35:18,671
guys that are locked up.
You should be protesting that every 

756
00:35:18,671 --> 00:35:20,951
fucking day of pop.
Really actually legal like in those 

757
00:35:20,951 --> 00:35:20,951
states,
they should just be letting dudes out by

758
00:35:20,951 --> 00:35:23,210
the fucking dozens every minute.
That is true.

759
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:25,100
If you were in Colorado and you're in 
jail,

760
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:27,230
I'll be like,
what the fuck?

761
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:33,550
What the fuck?
And then how many of those guys are in 

762
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:35,501
there and then they fucking catch a real
case in there because now you've got to 

763
00:35:35,501 --> 00:35:36,370
fight or you're an arrival.
Fuck,

764
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:38,760
that's horrible.
That does happen.

765
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:40,380
That does happen.
All that shit should be legal.

766
00:35:40,381 --> 00:35:41,850
The only thing that,
and people are like,

767
00:35:41,851 --> 00:35:43,200
well they,
if they do just tax,

768
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:45,120
everybody's like tax that the 
government,

769
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:49,680
but that's on the idea that the 
government gives a fuck the government.

770
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,280
I mean it makes more money.
It's not like if I can tax you who wants

771
00:35:53,281 --> 00:35:54,030
to buy weed?

772
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:59,570
I wondered how do I tax everybody?
I make them all scared and then I am 

773
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:03,651
prison guys for this illegality and then
I can get the public dollars because 

774
00:36:03,651 --> 00:36:08,450
look at isn't it scary that we got these
black and Mexican guys that are selling 

775
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:09,630
dope and we need to put them somewhere.
That's a business.

776
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:14,660
That's a huge business.
The whole business and that's why it's 

777
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:14,700
like a business though.
There's another business.

778
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:16,710
The other businesses,
legal marijuana,

779
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:21,830
will you make more money from tax 
dollars from legal marijuana in 

780
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:21,830
Colorado?
They do.

781
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:26,300
In this year in Colorado,
they made more money from tax dollars 

782
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:26,910
from marijuana.
They did from alcohol for the first time

783
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:27,600
ever.
Okay.

784
00:36:27,601 --> 00:36:29,370
But what I would love to see,
very high.

785
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:34,430
What I want to see then is those numbers
versus all the public and federal money 

786
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:38,970
that comes from taxpayers that goes into
law enforcement,

787
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:41,310
whether it's at sheriff,
drug enforcement levels,

788
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,110
dea levels,
FBI law,

789
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:46,500
like all the different funding,
which is fucking huge.

790
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:49,260
And all the prisons shit like where's 
all the.

791
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:54,320
So all the public tax dollars show me 
that the taxing on pot is more than 

792
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:54,960
that.
And I would agree,

793
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:57,840
but wharf.
I bet.

794
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,380
I bet you're right.
Well especially with drug enforcement is

795
00:37:01,381 --> 00:37:02,660
weird because you will,
you,

796
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,530
you're looking at a blanket,
you know,

797
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:06,900
you're looking at pills,
you're looking at heroin,

798
00:37:06,901 --> 00:37:08,580
coke,
the marijuana,

799
00:37:08,581 --> 00:37:09,930
drug enforcement,
legal,

800
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,730
make it all,
make well make it all legal and at least

801
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:15,150
you're gonna get taxes from stuff that's
already been sold anyway.

802
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:17,280
And then you can use that money for 
education,

803
00:37:17,281 --> 00:37:22,281
use that money for treatment.
But the people that are in law 

804
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:25,401
enforcement,
the problem with the law enforcement 

805
00:37:25,401 --> 00:37:27,831
when it comes to drugs,
it's like they're fucking lobbying to 

806
00:37:27,831 --> 00:37:27,910
keep shit illegally.
They do a lot of.

807
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:30,150
They don't want it legal.
They know why would you.

808
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:35,150
And then when you've got.
I believe it's the biggest union in the 

809
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:38,960
maybe in the world,
but in the country as the correctional 

810
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,200
prison guards.
So you got prison guards the biggest,

811
00:37:40,201 --> 00:37:41,580
but they.
They lobby there.

812
00:37:41,581 --> 00:37:44,350
One of the biggest contributors for drug
legalization,

813
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:49,790
keeping drugs illegal.
They lobby hard to make sure that drugs 

814
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:50,370
stay illegal because it keeps them in 
jobs.

815
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:55,550
But you know what man,
you just got to figure out alternatives 

816
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:58,251
for those people.
Do you think people that are prison 

817
00:37:58,251 --> 00:37:59,961
guards want to be fucking prison guards?
If you could find some sort of a 

818
00:37:59,961 --> 00:38:02,160
positive job if you could.
But I bet a lot of those guys are like,

819
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:05,400
I'm in power over some fucking bad 
motherfuckers.

820
00:38:05,401 --> 00:38:10,401
And they liked that.
The consciousness is fucked up because 

821
00:38:10,401 --> 00:38:10,401
they're like,
well,

822
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:12,540
if you've got that job,
you're a prisoner,

823
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:14,690
you're a prisoner all doing.

824
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:19,730
I mean,
you've been chosen to be a prisoner and 

825
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:19,730
you think you're free,
you're fucked.

826
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:22,950
You're a head guy.
He just don't know until it's a guy 

827
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:25,131
that's Kinda got that kind of 
consciousness to where he doesn't even 

828
00:38:25,131 --> 00:38:26,190
know he's fought qm.
Imagine the feeling that you must get,

829
00:38:26,191 --> 00:38:29,820
like they shut those gates behind you 
and you're working with all those people

830
00:38:29,821 --> 00:38:34,821
that are in there for life and you got 
to go home at night and then you're 

831
00:38:34,821 --> 00:38:34,920
going to go home at night and you can 
quit and leave anytime you.

832
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:39,430
But your work environment is filled with
all these people that are just doomed.

833
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:40,990
They're doomed.
Occasionally.

834
00:38:40,991 --> 00:38:41,610
They arrived.
Yeah.

835
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:44,470
I don't watch that.
Freeway.

836
00:38:44,471 --> 00:38:47,770
Rick Ross a documentary last week and I 
thought,

837
00:38:47,771 --> 00:38:48,790
man,
that is crazy.

838
00:38:48,791 --> 00:38:51,040
Like you're like,
you know,

839
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:53,890
like more money than it.
Like get anything.

840
00:38:53,891 --> 00:38:58,891
You're living a life that like is is 
like if Bill Gates had an exciting life 

841
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:00,910
type,
whatever you wanted to do,

842
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:02,410
any,
any vacations,

843
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:05,050
any anything,
and then you go into nothing of prison.

844
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:10,280
Then you come out and he's just like 
printing tee shirts or whatever he's 

845
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:10,280
trying to do and trying to stay busy.
Just trying to hustle.

846
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:15,090
Fuck yeah,
he does like speeches and does a bunch 

847
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:17,881
of different shit,
but he's just trying to hustle and stay 

848
00:39:17,881 --> 00:39:17,881
straight.
Yeah,

849
00:39:17,881 --> 00:39:17,881
that's.
It's hard man.

850
00:39:17,881 --> 00:39:20,650
It's also crazy because he went in and 
he was making all that money,

851
00:39:20,651 --> 00:39:23,360
millions and millions of dollars and you
couldn't read millions a day,

852
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:28,890
millions a day,
couldn't read and then figured out how 

853
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:29,920
to read.
Then figured out how to fucking read law

854
00:39:29,921 --> 00:39:34,921
books and then figured out that his case
was bullshit and then got it overturned 

855
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:38,260
because he was in.
He was under the three strikes law,

856
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:42,400
but they tried to try him for going 
criminal enterprise,

857
00:39:42,401 --> 00:39:45,160
not a,
not a or whatever.

858
00:39:45,161 --> 00:39:47,610
It's like it was one robbing spree that 
it,

859
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:50,180
that it wasn't secular events is how he 
did it.

860
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:52,780
Like so there were saying Ohio is a 
separate thing and he's like,

861
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:57,960
no,
because I was on a continuous criminal 

862
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,791
spree,
like my whole life was a continuous 

863
00:39:59,791 --> 00:39:59,791
criminal spree.
Well the three strike thing,

864
00:39:59,791 --> 00:40:04,081
they tried to,
they tried him for two things at the 

865
00:40:04,081 --> 00:40:06,340
same time and it's not how it works.
You're supposed to go away and then they

866
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:09,760
catch you again and you go away and then
they catch you again at three strikes,

867
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:15,210
but they tried to do it for him with 
more than one different things tagged 

868
00:40:15,581 --> 00:40:17,740
onto one arrest.
That's not how it works.

869
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,600
Oh.
And then they planted a bunch of shit on

870
00:40:19,601 --> 00:40:21,820
him as father to put them in jail to 
win.

871
00:40:21,821 --> 00:40:26,821
That's the thing.
It's weird that they let them out that 

872
00:40:26,821 --> 00:40:27,040
that worked like that work because he 
was right.

873
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:29,340
Yeah,
but the problem,

874
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:31,240
I'm going to be talking about this a 
lot.

875
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:34,370
I think the problem with law enforcement
in general,

876
00:40:34,371 --> 00:40:36,610
like one of the big problems is that 
people want to win.

877
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:41,780
When people get into game,
whether it's Jujitsu or it's fucking 

878
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:41,860
ping pong,
you want to win,

879
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:44,050
or like the drug testers,
like they're not looking,

880
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,270
they're not wanting you to have.
I mean that's not true.

881
00:40:46,271 --> 00:40:51,271
Some guys probably are,
but they're not looking for you to have 

882
00:40:51,271 --> 00:40:53,281
a free test.
Like I want to catch this dirty guy and 

883
00:40:53,281 --> 00:40:53,281
they see all the guys is dirty.
You know what I mean?

884
00:40:53,281 --> 00:40:54,190
But I mean that's the hustle,
right?

885
00:40:54,191 --> 00:40:55,540
That's,
that's what they're trying to do.

886
00:40:55,541 --> 00:40:59,380
They're trying to catch people cheating 
so they get this motherfucker like every

887
00:40:59,381 --> 00:41:02,860
day you're playing a game and the game 
is catch the guy with the rubber Dick.

888
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:04,660
Do you think they should?
Oh,

889
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,500
therapists.
There was an eight or.

890
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:10,300
Yeah.
Jeff Manson made that famous.

891
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:11,230
Did he?
Yeah,

892
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:16,250
he didn't.
What was the first guy that I know that 

893
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:16,900
I'd heard about a wizard later with?
Those guys are fucking.

894
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:22,080
I think all that shit should be illegal 
to like when they do gene splicing or 

895
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:22,450
whatever the fuck is next that they're 
going to do.

896
00:41:22,451 --> 00:41:27,451
Like they're going to have miles that 
and inhibitors and all that kind of 

897
00:41:27,451 --> 00:41:30,181
stuff.
You're going to have a thing if all 

898
00:41:30,181 --> 00:41:32,380
these fucking useless fucking nerds that
are regulating this shit or like we want

899
00:41:32,921 --> 00:41:34,340
to have clean athletes,

900
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:35,390
whatever.
Okay,

901
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:40,480
so you're going to have a crowd of 
fucking people at the mgm that are all 

902
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,021
in way better shape and condition than 
the actual fucking fighters that are 

903
00:41:44,021 --> 00:41:44,360
competing.
That is for sure.

904
00:41:44,361 --> 00:41:46,430
When the future.
When that does happen,

905
00:41:46,431 --> 00:41:51,431
we're going to have to have a totally 
new conversation because I think right 

906
00:41:51,431 --> 00:41:54,161
now what's going on is they're just 
trying to prevent the first drips of 

907
00:41:54,161 --> 00:41:56,090
water that are coming out of that dam 
and they're putting their fingers in it.

908
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:57,790
It's like stops and the,
you know,

909
00:41:57,860 --> 00:42:00,210
stopping the rise of the machines.
Elan Musk,

910
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:01,880
you're not going to do it.
It's common.

911
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,020
It's common.
It's common.

912
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:05,030
What are you going to do with the rise 
of New Mexico?

913
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:07,140
Of this roll?
Baby Roll.

914
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:10,480
I'll write it out.
How do we do this?

915
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:11,480
I'll survive.
Well,

916
00:42:11,481 --> 00:42:13,450
tell me how we do this freestyle.
I don't know.

917
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:13,760
I can't.

918
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:19,450
I can't plan because a ranch,
we've been talking about that for 

919
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:19,450
decades.
Do it.

920
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:19,450
All right.
Come on man.

921
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:24,240
What state you're making some fucking 
watch it actually movie.

922
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:29,330
I see you can get shot and then sicario 
right now.

923
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:31,560
Are you in that whale?
And I heard yelling in Spanish.

924
00:42:31,561 --> 00:42:32,840
Shit.
Motherfuckers really.

925
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,610
I heard that movies don't,
can anybody speak Spanish?

926
00:42:35,611 --> 00:42:37,670
And I'm like right here.
I looked around,

927
00:42:37,671 --> 00:42:42,671
there's four of us and I looked around 
and there was fucking bunch of Chicago 

928
00:42:42,671 --> 00:42:42,671
dudes in me and I was like,
well,

929
00:42:42,671 --> 00:42:43,640
if one of these guys and none of them 
raise their hand.

930
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,700
Boom.
And then I got on my text to fucking,

931
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:47,390
uh,
uh,

932
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:50,570
the guy that coaches Jujitsu for us at 
10th planet in Santa Fe.

933
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:51,770
And I'm like,
Hey Ruben,

934
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:57,140
how do I get through tax?
I,

935
00:42:58,441 --> 00:42:59,000
I,
uh,

936
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:00,590
yeah,
through text or texts,

937
00:43:00,591 --> 00:43:01,040
he fucking.

938
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:01,890
I'm like,
dude,

939
00:43:01,891 --> 00:43:06,620
you got to write it out phonetically.
I don't know the real sound right?

940
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:09,740
You just gotTa get one of those worlds 
and practiced over and over.

941
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:14,770
It was in the moment.
It was like going to film 20 minutes 

942
00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:14,770
later.
Oh,

943
00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:14,770
right.
Then they're like,

944
00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:16,580
hey,
we want to add to scene in is awesome.

945
00:43:16,610 --> 00:43:18,320
Oh Shit.
A little known secret.

946
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:20,570
Wow.
I'll tell anybody too late.

947
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:23,210
That's awesome.
I love that.

948
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:23,740
Yeah,
Dude.

949
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,930
Just make shit happen.
You know what I mean?

950
00:43:25,950 --> 00:43:27,170
Like,
just freestyle,

951
00:43:27,171 --> 00:43:28,490
that shit.
Like Howard is going to work.

952
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:30,740
It was like the whole movie thing and 
going,

953
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:32,030
how did this happen?
I'm like,

954
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:33,540
fuck,
I don't know.

955
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:34,850
Like I try to ask you.
I'm like,

956
00:43:34,851 --> 00:43:36,020
do I need an agent on it?
And you're like,

957
00:43:36,021 --> 00:43:36,770
fuck,
I don't know.

958
00:43:36,771 --> 00:43:41,771
And you know,
one of the best things that I've heard 

959
00:43:41,771 --> 00:43:42,380
about it is a fucking pauly shore.

960
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:44,930
And he goes,
he was at the poly shore and said,

961
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:50,360
now he was given advice to like three 
other little actors like Benji and a 

962
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:51,380
couple people that were comics at the,
at the store.

963
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:52,820
And he goes,
uh,

964
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:54,760
you know,
the truth is,

965
00:43:54,770 --> 00:43:58,310
is nobody knows how to do it.
And I just took that and I go,

966
00:43:58,311 --> 00:43:59,330
okay,
fuck everybody.

967
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:01,190
Everybody that tell you how to do it,
they never done it.

968
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:04,820
All those people are coaching,
acting or they're doing whatever.

969
00:44:04,821 --> 00:44:09,821
And I'm like,
I'm just going to run with this and 

970
00:44:09,821 --> 00:44:09,821
fucking do it and I'll show up and I see
the guys that are there.

971
00:44:09,821 --> 00:44:09,821
And I go,
I'm like,

972
00:44:09,821 --> 00:44:10,520
well,
I don't know that I'm great,

973
00:44:10,521 --> 00:44:12,560
but I know I'm better than that guy.
And uh,

974
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,870
will you also have an unusual look?
I do,

975
00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:16,580
I do.
I've been told that a lot.

976
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:20,000
Not Paying off,
but you know,

977
00:44:20,001 --> 00:44:22,520
you're a big giant dude.
You got a crazy beard,

978
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:27,910
you know,
you know how to fight like you have all 

979
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:27,910
these skills.
Handsomest man,

980
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:28,670
intelligence,
green eyed devil,

981
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:32,610
you've got a lot going on.
How all that came.

982
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,050
And then I just got,
I just kept,

983
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:39,470
you know,
what I was used to live like thinking 

984
00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:39,470
another shoe's about to drop,
right for a long time.

985
00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:41,610
And I thought it was just not going to 
end up good.

986
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:46,670
And because like I didn't correlate that
my actions were getting my results in a 

987
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:46,980
lot of ways,
you know.

988
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,050
And uh,
and I think,

989
00:44:49,070 --> 00:44:54,070
you know,
a big part of that is just being 

990
00:44:54,070 --> 00:44:54,070
accountable for your life.
Like a guy told me,

991
00:44:54,070 --> 00:44:54,070
he says,
you know,

992
00:44:54,070 --> 00:44:55,290
you're all fucked up and I go,
why?

993
00:44:55,350 --> 00:45:00,350
And he said,
because you think you're a good guy 

994
00:45:00,350 --> 00:45:04,610
because you base yourself on your 
intentions and the whole world is 

995
00:45:04,610 --> 00:45:04,800
reacting to your actions.

996
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:07,260
And I was like,
what?

997
00:45:07,261 --> 00:45:09,450
Don't they know that I'm saying I 
intended and I'm like,

998
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:10,850
none of that shit,
you know,

999
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:12,720
if you step on a dude's shoes and you 
didn't,

1000
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:15,360
you didn't mean to.
His shoes are still fucking dirty.

1001
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:20,450
And uh,
and so like just bringing all that shit 

1002
00:45:20,450 --> 00:45:23,121
into my everyday and I think the whole 
thing more and more that I think about 

1003
00:45:23,121 --> 00:45:23,460
is heightening awareness and the more 
you are aware,

1004
00:45:23,461 --> 00:45:25,410
the less dumb you are and the less dumb 
you are,

1005
00:45:25,411 --> 00:45:27,480
the better off you do.
That's a really good.

1006
00:45:27,481 --> 00:45:30,210
You can train yourself to be more aware,
you know?

1007
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:35,240
Yes you can.
And it happens all the time and you 

1008
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:35,240
don't just get it,
but you get layers of it,

1009
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:36,160
you know,
layers.

1010
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:41,270
The hole.
That's all great way of putting it the 

1011
00:45:41,270 --> 00:45:43,281
whole way.
You just said it is a great way of 

1012
00:45:43,281 --> 00:45:43,281
putting it.

1013
00:45:43,281 --> 00:45:45,440
The,
I think a lot of people think that 

1014
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,811
they're a good person,
they'll do douchey or they're trying to 

1015
00:45:47,811 --> 00:45:48,490
get away with something because they're 
hustling,

1016
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:53,520
they're broke and you know,
it's that constant self reflection and 

1017
00:45:53,551 --> 00:45:54,060
people are like,
well,

1018
00:45:54,061 --> 00:45:55,680
how are you successful or whatever.
And I'm like,

1019
00:45:56,310 --> 00:45:57,600
because I'm a loser,
you know,

1020
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:58,260
like,
I don't remember.

1021
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,060
I remember talking with you and you're 
like,

1022
00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:02,880
I always felt like a loser too.
Like when we'd go on the road and Shit,

1023
00:46:02,881 --> 00:46:07,881
and you're like,
because I'm living a life that's 

1024
00:46:07,881 --> 00:46:09,831
different than other people live living.
I'm not a nine to five guy or whatever 

1025
00:46:09,831 --> 00:46:09,831
the thing is,
you know,

1026
00:46:09,831 --> 00:46:12,360
and so you're living this life that's 
out of the norm.

1027
00:46:12,361 --> 00:46:17,361
And it's like,
and thank God you get to be an uncommon 

1028
00:46:17,361 --> 00:46:20,031
man in that way.
The other way would have killed me and 

1029
00:46:20,031 --> 00:46:21,060
you and Eddie and Ari and you know what 
I mean,

1030
00:46:21,061 --> 00:46:23,310
and Duncan md and you look at all of 
that and I go,

1031
00:46:23,311 --> 00:46:27,450
that's no fucking mistake that we're all
doing well,

1032
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:28,440
happy positive.

1033
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:29,490
And I go,
man,

1034
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:34,500
I owe everything to the people that I've
chosen to have around me have been 

1035
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:35,610
graced about my life.
Huge,

1036
00:46:35,611 --> 00:46:38,730
huge part of your life.
And you also,

1037
00:46:38,731 --> 00:46:40,950
you get power when your friends are 
doing well.

1038
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:44,520
Like when I see you in movies,
I get power when I see you in John Wick.

1039
00:46:44,521 --> 00:46:46,050
Okay.
I got power from that and I was like,

1040
00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:47,100
Ooh,
we all,

1041
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:48,420
it's like an inquiry.
It's like,

1042
00:46:48,930 --> 00:46:51,360
how do you stay inspired?
He stay around inspirational people.

1043
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:52,480
You know what I mean?
That.

1044
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:57,500
And that's the thing for me.
And so like whether it's the gym I work 

1045
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:57,500
out at or,
or uh,

1046
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:01,760
you know,
what I'm putting in my body or anything 

1047
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:01,760
like I'm living,
like,

1048
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:01,760
all that shit matters,
man.

1049
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:06,650
Where I'm living.
I used to live in Hancock Park and then 

1050
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:06,720
I moved to Venice and I'm like,
oh my people are in Venice and I want to

1051
00:47:06,721 --> 00:47:07,530
be near the ocean.

1052
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:12,530
And like fucking,
that's a different vibe down there is a 

1053
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:12,530
different vibe.
It's very crowded,

1054
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:13,350
but it's a great vibe.
It's so nice,

1055
00:47:13,351 --> 00:47:14,550
man.
It's more relaxing.

1056
00:47:14,551 --> 00:47:16,470
It's like being in New Mexico for me.
So,

1057
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:21,530
uh,
Jim likes to each other though I don't 

1058
00:47:21,530 --> 00:47:21,530
like to the crowdedness of go.
That's why I could never look at,

1059
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:24,570
look at like New York.
I'm only at like Deuce Jim.

1060
00:47:24,571 --> 00:47:26,490
The place where I work out at and train 
a lot is like,

1061
00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:29,890
I know where that is outdoors and right 
across the top I'm just,

1062
00:47:29,891 --> 00:47:31,720
they're posted up.
We do podcasts there.

1063
00:47:31,721 --> 00:47:33,190
Fuck around.
Like it's Rad.

1064
00:47:33,191 --> 00:47:38,191
It's fucking Nice.
And then everything's walking distance 

1065
00:47:38,191 --> 00:47:38,191
that your friends Jim,
do you?

1066
00:47:38,191 --> 00:47:38,191
Yeah,
yeah,

1067
00:47:38,191 --> 00:47:38,191
yeah.
Yeah.

1068
00:47:38,191 --> 00:47:39,580
And so you live up near there?
Yeah,

1069
00:47:39,581 --> 00:47:40,570
just like,
I don't know,

1070
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:43,730
that's nice areas.
A lot of good restaurants,

1071
00:47:43,870 --> 00:47:48,870
a lot of great.
If you had a place to park your car 

1072
00:47:48,870 --> 00:47:51,850
parking's better than Hollywood beats 
the shit out of parking in Hollywood.

1073
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,830
That's true.
Hollywood is so ridiculous.

1074
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:57,160
You can walk like my favorite 
restaurants or like clubs on Lincoln and

1075
00:47:57,161 --> 00:48:01,540
then Oscar's down on rose and those are 
just both five minutes from anywhere.

1076
00:48:01,541 --> 00:48:06,260
Like it's easy or there's a great 
Italian restaurant in Washington too.

1077
00:48:06,290 --> 00:48:08,880
It's like there's a lot of good places 
down there like you said,

1078
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:10,620
and uh,
and there's always value.

1079
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:11,120
No,
fuck.

1080
00:48:11,170 --> 00:48:14,480
Utilize Valet.
If you're fucking,

1081
00:48:15,030 --> 00:48:17,920
you just got to drive the right car.
You can drive your car.

1082
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:20,550
I have a pickup truck.
I'm a Goddamn American.

1083
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:22,770
I don't have the Rogan money yet.
I didn't have that.

1084
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:26,860
You know what the WHO does this is it to
my pat like I've got.

1085
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:30,940
So after breaking bad I did,
I got some money off of that and I was.

1086
00:48:31,030 --> 00:48:33,700
And then at that same time,
a friend of mine from New Mexico,

1087
00:48:34,150 --> 00:48:35,110
this guy,
Rico Taylor,

1088
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:36,730
he calls and he goes,
hey dude,

1089
00:48:36,731 --> 00:48:37,450
I'm,
I'm a.

1090
00:48:37,890 --> 00:48:42,610
and he was best friends with my friend 
Marcos who started in level with me.

1091
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:46,930
And so noah was like,
everybody I fuck with is all people that

1092
00:48:46,931 --> 00:48:50,200
I love and that had been tied in to for 
a long time and everybody's doing good.

1093
00:48:50,201 --> 00:48:55,201
It's Rad.
But he just picked up a lambo because 

1094
00:48:55,201 --> 00:48:55,201
he's like any.
And he goes,

1095
00:48:55,201 --> 00:48:55,450
he goes,
Hey,

1096
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:59,670
is it realistic that I get A.
I put 60 down on it and I'll pay it.

1097
00:48:59,671 --> 00:49:02,730
I don't know if it's four grand a month 
or something and um,

1098
00:49:02,890 --> 00:49:04,500
you know,
does that sound reasonable to you then?

1099
00:49:04,501 --> 00:49:05,190
And I'm like,
fuck,

1100
00:49:06,850 --> 00:49:11,850
that's crazy at my house.
What the fuck?

1101
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:15,920
That's a mortgage.
That's an apartment in New York City for

1102
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,690
33 years old and you can fucking do that
and be fuck yes.

1103
00:49:19,691 --> 00:49:21,370
Do that.
Live unreasonable life.

1104
00:49:21,550 --> 00:49:24,220
Do that thing.
So we got that money.

1105
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:27,130
What happened with that was it seeded 
these bars,

1106
00:49:27,131 --> 00:49:29,560
concrete cowboy.
And so we got one in Austin.

1107
00:49:29,561 --> 00:49:31,750
We've got one in Houston in five weeks 
we'll open,

1108
00:49:31,751 --> 00:49:35,340
we've got one in Dallas and it's paid 
back like six times invested.

1109
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:38,950
But I gave that money going,
I don't have any more money in the world

1110
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:40,420
and fuck it.
I had been broke before.

1111
00:49:40,421 --> 00:49:45,421
Here's my money.
And fucking I knew that Rico would take 

1112
00:49:45,421 --> 00:49:47,971
care of it.
I knew he'd be a good steward of it and 

1113
00:49:47,971 --> 00:49:47,971
if it didn't work it didn't work and 
whatever.

1114
00:49:47,971 --> 00:49:50,380
And like that being free about it.
And like I did a couple things,

1115
00:49:50,381 --> 00:49:52,450
like it made me go,
the money's not you,

1116
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:55,300
it doesn't matter.
Like that's a replaceable commodity,

1117
00:49:55,301 --> 00:49:58,720
that's nothing.
And also it's like I've been rolling the

1118
00:49:58,721 --> 00:50:03,721
dice my whole life,
so let's roll the dice and then we 

1119
00:50:03,721 --> 00:50:03,721
fucking just started taking off with 
that.

1120
00:50:03,721 --> 00:50:05,800
And then three years later mother 
fuckers driving a Lamborghini.

1121
00:50:06,910 --> 00:50:11,050
Fucking rad dude ran a shitbox as though
tell him those things.

1122
00:50:11,070 --> 00:50:12,340
I wrote,
I wrote that thing.

1123
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,110
Well you know what he says,
because like you just,

1124
00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:16,840
you just roll it for two years and then 
you can sell it back,

1125
00:50:16,841 --> 00:50:18,100
you can make money on it.
And then.

1126
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:19,540
And then I said then why?
He says,

1127
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:22,030
well then you're just in the flip.
Then you got a Lamborghini.

1128
00:50:22,031 --> 00:50:24,070
Every year you get a new one.
I telling you to.

1129
00:50:24,071 --> 00:50:29,071
I don't want to do that.
I like what I wanna do is I want to get 

1130
00:50:29,071 --> 00:50:29,420
one of those.
I got four by fours or $200,000.

1131
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:32,690
It's not even that I had this 65.
I don't want to do.

1132
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:37,750
Yeah,
but I called that dude before he was on 

1133
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:37,750
your show and I was board.
Yeah.

1134
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:37,900
And I go or I emailed him.

1135
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:38,960
Then he called me back.
I go,

1136
00:50:38,961 --> 00:50:40,190
Hey Rad,
I'm like,

1137
00:50:40,390 --> 00:50:41,670
this guy's calling me.
And,

1138
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:46,750
and uh,
he must've thought I had some Jay Leno 

1139
00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:46,750
money or something.
He's like,

1140
00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:49,601
Oh yeah,
I used to work with guys in your field 

1141
00:50:49,601 --> 00:50:49,601
or whatever.
I'm like,

1142
00:50:49,601 --> 00:50:49,601
what's my.
I'm like,

1143
00:50:49,601 --> 00:50:49,601
what,
what is my field like?

1144
00:50:49,601 --> 00:50:51,380
I don't even really know.
And it's like,

1145
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:52,160
well,
an actor and I go,

1146
00:50:52,161 --> 00:50:52,700
oh,
okay,

1147
00:50:52,701 --> 00:50:53,990
cool.
And uh,

1148
00:50:54,170 --> 00:50:54,830
and he's like,
yeah,

1149
00:50:54,831 --> 00:50:57,430
to Redo your really.
It'd be like,

1150
00:50:57,450 --> 00:50:58,750
you know,
around 400.

1151
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:03,800
I'm like,
you're talking to the wrong fucking 

1152
00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:05,730
crazy.
I don't know,

1153
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:07,080
ground up like,
you know,

1154
00:51:07,081 --> 00:51:10,760
the whole digitized and,
and Redo the whole undercarriage and the

1155
00:51:10,761 --> 00:51:14,090
whole brake system and this know 
$400,000,

1156
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:19,120
I don't know because anyone can come in 
under 400 a boy tait fletcher on 

1157
00:51:19,941 --> 00:51:20,450
instagram

1158
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:27,020
because those,
a broncos are too brought to the,

1159
00:51:27,370 --> 00:51:32,370
done to the test.
He's got those though and then he's got 

1160
00:51:32,370 --> 00:51:35,511
like the reformers and then it's always,
there are different price points and I 

1161
00:51:35,511 --> 00:51:38,010
think if you bring your own box of 
hazards to him,

1162
00:51:38,011 --> 00:51:39,570
he probably thinks about it a different 
way.

1163
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:44,580
Who knows what,
he does a bunch of different kinds of 

1164
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:44,580
cars,
but one of the coolest ones he does his,

1165
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:46,370
those old Toyota land cruisers.
Yeah.

1166
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:49,150
He takes those uh,
fj 62.

1167
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:54,440
They don't even look that cool.
And then he puts a corvette engine in 

1168
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:56,880
them.
He puts a modern corvette engine in them

1169
00:51:56,881 --> 00:52:01,050
and fucking completely to see that one.
The white one.

1170
00:52:01,470 --> 00:52:04,060
I like that with all that billeted 
fucking steal that one.

1171
00:52:04,061 --> 00:52:06,290
Stupid expensive.
That one's like way,

1172
00:52:06,750 --> 00:52:09,180
way into the twos.
Like high twos.

1173
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:14,210
There's a used one I saw on youtube or 
on Ebay or somewhere like 1:40.

1174
00:52:14,310 --> 00:52:16,110
They were really.
Yeah.

1175
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:17,430
Wow.
That's a bargain.

1176
00:52:17,431 --> 00:52:19,830
But a diesel fucking diesel.
Awesome.

1177
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:22,090
A diesel power.
Wang and really see.

1178
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:24,480
He does amazing stuff.
That guy,

1179
00:52:24,481 --> 00:52:27,660
he's a real.
He's a real engineer and an astute.

1180
00:52:27,661 --> 00:52:28,930
I.
Well you go to,

1181
00:52:28,950 --> 00:52:30,930
I'll take you to his place if you want 
to go and check it out.

1182
00:52:30,931 --> 00:52:31,590
I called him.
I was like,

1183
00:52:31,591 --> 00:52:32,250
when are you there?
He's like,

1184
00:52:32,251 --> 00:52:32,970
oh,
next week or whatever.

1185
00:52:32,971 --> 00:52:33,300
Yeah.
Yeah.

1186
00:52:33,330 --> 00:52:34,220
Let's go.
Come with me.

1187
00:52:34,230 --> 00:52:36,510
I'll go with you.
Because he's doing a blazer now.

1188
00:52:36,511 --> 00:52:38,850
A K five blazer,
those old Chevy Blazers,

1189
00:52:39,630 --> 00:52:41,320
if he's going to do it,
it's going to be insane.

1190
00:52:41,321 --> 00:52:43,440
Fuck is going to do an icon version of 
the blazer.

1191
00:52:43,441 --> 00:52:47,250
So he's gonna completely update the 
suspension and all the components.

1192
00:52:47,251 --> 00:52:48,590
But yeah man,
his,

1193
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:50,560
his employees or his,
uh,

1194
00:52:50,870 --> 00:52:53,460
customers are just rich as fuck.
I mean those are the kind of,

1195
00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:55,530
what is the Jay Leno's of the world and 
all that.

1196
00:52:56,160 --> 00:53:01,160
I mean,
I heard him on your show and he was 

1197
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:01,160
like,
yeah,

1198
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:01,160
Dana wanted one but he didn't want to 
wait or whatever.

1199
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:01,350
And I'm like,
holy fuck.

1200
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:02,370
That's.
Yeah,

1201
00:53:02,371 --> 00:53:07,371
it takes over a year.
I mean he has full time employees 

1202
00:53:07,371 --> 00:53:10,080
working on your car for over a year.
I mean that's why it costs $200,000.

1203
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:12,150
But when you go there,
you get it.

1204
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:14,460
Like when I went to his shop and like,
oh,

1205
00:53:14,461 --> 00:53:15,990
I get it.
He's like,

1206
00:53:15,991 --> 00:53:20,991
yeah,
you could cut a lot of corners here and 

1207
00:53:20,991 --> 00:53:21,810
there and have it look the same and cost
$100,000.

1208
00:53:22,170 --> 00:53:24,720
But this fucking guy is doing everything
like that.

1209
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:25,900
What the best

1210
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:28,890
that I can get?
What's the best buy his stuff?

1211
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:34,280
It's not like driving off the thing at 
west coast customs or something like 

1212
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:34,320
that or wherever it is and it's like,
yeah,

1213
00:53:34,321 --> 00:53:36,750
see and if you've got a problem,
come on back and we'll try to be like,

1214
00:53:37,070 --> 00:53:42,070
that's the dude that is like,
he cares about every piece that comes 

1215
00:53:42,070 --> 00:53:42,070
through.
Oh No.

1216
00:53:42,070 --> 00:53:44,700
He not only just care that guy.
If he doesn't care,

1217
00:53:44,701 --> 00:53:46,010
he won't build it.
Right.

1218
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:46,980
He won't build it.
Yeah.

1219
00:53:47,130 --> 00:53:51,990
Like if he would've said no to Dana,
how he just saying no.

1220
00:53:51,991 --> 00:53:53,600
Like being like,
that's not.

1221
00:53:53,601 --> 00:53:58,601
That's outside of my book.
Those has to do is wait around and say 

1222
00:53:58,741 --> 00:54:00,610
contact me whenever you got one for 
sale.

1223
00:54:01,130 --> 00:54:03,690
Bronco number one just went up for sale.
He could throw,

1224
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:06,420
throw money in an account and go here.
I'll pre pay for it.

1225
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:08,490
Just hollering the unit when it's done 
or whatever.

1226
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,250
Well Dana's you're still going to want 
it in a year and patient.

1227
00:54:11,251 --> 00:54:13,620
You're still going to want it next year.
He'll be like,

1228
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:14,860
can I get one now?
Well,

1229
00:54:14,870 --> 00:54:16,770
you could have if you were to give me 
money last year,

1230
00:54:17,730 --> 00:54:19,440
but now it's another year.
Well,

1231
00:54:19,441 --> 00:54:21,750
it's more now.
I think he's in a 2018.

1232
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:24,750
That's the thing about the broncos 
getting better at anything.

1233
00:54:24,751 --> 00:54:25,970
It's like you're always,
you're,

1234
00:54:26,050 --> 00:54:28,170
there's gonna come a day when you want 
to get better.

1235
00:54:28,830 --> 00:54:30,570
Fucking do it now.
Like that was one of the best,

1236
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:33,300
like one of the.
So many coaching,

1237
00:54:33,301 --> 00:54:37,440
like sports has given me so much,
but I'm like.

1238
00:54:37,441 --> 00:54:42,441
Then arsdale one time he would do like 
guided meditation sometimes after 

1239
00:54:42,441 --> 00:54:45,020
practice and so there's fucking 40 
sweaty guys laying on the mat.

1240
00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:48,170
So he turned the lights off in the gym 
at Jackson's and uh,

1241
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:49,620
and he'd go,
Hey,

1242
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:50,310
I know you guys.

1243
00:54:50,310 --> 00:54:54,390
We did a lot of technical wrestling 
today and you think,

1244
00:54:54,990 --> 00:54:55,590
Hey,
I'm young.

1245
00:54:55,620 --> 00:54:58,080
There's a lot of time and I'll be able 
to get this.

1246
00:54:58,081 --> 00:54:59,520
I'll put this together.
I'll piece together.

1247
00:54:59,521 --> 00:55:01,170
I got a little better today.
He says,

1248
00:55:01,171 --> 00:55:06,171
I just want you to consider that there's
a guy that's demanding to be better 

1249
00:55:06,171 --> 00:55:07,170
right now.
There's a guy that knows he needs to get

1250
00:55:07,171 --> 00:55:12,171
it today.
And you're going to have to fight that 

1251
00:55:12,171 --> 00:55:12,171
guy.
So he's like,

1252
00:55:12,171 --> 00:55:12,171
fucking turn your fucking learning curve
up.

1253
00:55:12,171 --> 00:55:14,640
And like he would really speak into that
kind of a voice of going.

1254
00:55:14,970 --> 00:55:17,430
It's not just,
it's not just when it happens,

1255
00:55:17,431 --> 00:55:22,431
it happens.
It's like demand that you get better 

1256
00:55:22,431 --> 00:55:25,131
now.
And that's a powerful way to look at 

1257
00:55:25,131 --> 00:55:25,131
stuff.
I think there's some,

1258
00:55:25,131 --> 00:55:25,131
some wrestling mentality,
man,

1259
00:55:25,131 --> 00:55:27,270
those wrestlers are fucking.
That's a different breed of guy.

1260
00:55:27,271 --> 00:55:28,260
They're like,
I need to do this.

1261
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:33,540
Well,
I think you have that with boxers you 

1262
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:35,751
have that would kick box.
You have that with anybody who is just 

1263
00:55:35,751 --> 00:55:37,590
fanatical about improvement.
You have to have that insane,

1264
00:55:37,591 --> 00:55:42,591
insane.
Just the drive to believe fiction and 

1265
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:42,591
belief.
Yeah.

1266
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:44,310
But you got to be obsessed,
man.

1267
00:55:44,490 --> 00:55:49,490
If you're not obsessed,
you're not going to beat the guys 

1268
00:55:49,490 --> 00:55:51,470
obsessed.
I remember when I saw fucking foundry 

1269
00:55:51,470 --> 00:55:51,470
Ellen's,
when he first came down,

1270
00:55:51,470 --> 00:55:54,710
the first time I'd ever seen him was 
when I never knew anything about him 

1271
00:55:54,710 --> 00:55:55,860
until he beat up Stephan Bonner and I 
was live at that fight and I was like,

1272
00:55:55,890 --> 00:55:58,770
holy fuck.
And he was just learning back then,

1273
00:55:58,810 --> 00:56:00,820
didn't know,
and the throws I was like,

1274
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:05,310
and Stephens is maybe bigger than me.
He's fucking nuts.

1275
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:06,900
Not Small.
He's good.

1276
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,570
He's adept at everything and he's 
hitting them with elbows,

1277
00:56:09,571 --> 00:56:14,571
like their jabs and knees and then 
throwing them like crate anytime it'd 

1278
00:56:14,571 --> 00:56:14,571
get close to them,
throw them.

1279
00:56:14,571 --> 00:56:15,030
And I was like,
holy fuck.

1280
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:16,620
And then,
I don't know,

1281
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:19,740
a month or two months later he came to 
Jackson's and he's there and I'm like,

1282
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:21,480
I was eight.
And I knew he wrestled,

1283
00:56:21,481 --> 00:56:22,890
like I knew a bunch of tough wrestlers 
from,

1284
00:56:22,950 --> 00:56:23,890
from uh,
New York.

1285
00:56:23,891 --> 00:56:24,040
And

1286
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:24,950
I was like,
uh,

1287
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,150
where'd you there Moitai though?
Because like Tom Watson,

1288
00:56:28,151 --> 00:56:32,650
or he'd just gotten back from a Dutch 
kickboxing camp and dudes go to Thailand

1289
00:56:32,651 --> 00:56:34,560
all the time and there's all that.
And,

1290
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,320
and he goes,
uh,

1291
00:56:36,490 --> 00:56:41,110
youtube fuck,
fuck,

1292
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:42,970
like dudes are dying and you're just 
like.

1293
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:43,810
He's like,
well,

1294
00:56:43,811 --> 00:56:45,420
I look at it and I go,
whoa.

1295
00:56:45,430 --> 00:56:48,040
And then I believe and I'm like,
holy fuck,

1296
00:56:48,670 --> 00:56:51,730
like no proper training.
He just watches shit on a video.

1297
00:56:51,731 --> 00:56:54,280
And you're like,
don't watch the matrix.

1298
00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:56,730
He's a special talent.
He is a special talent.

1299
00:56:57,250 --> 00:57:01,300
One of the problems with John is that he
absolutely has worked hard,

1300
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:05,410
but it has come way easier for him than 
it has for other people and I think part

1301
00:57:05,411 --> 00:57:08,830
of that is because he grew up with two 
super athletes for brothers.

1302
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:14,100
Kenny wouldn't match you just getting 
your ass kicked all the time in your 

1303
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:16,651
house by giant super athletes.
Both his brothers are NFL fucking 

1304
00:57:16,651 --> 00:57:16,651
allstars.
Yeah,

1305
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:17,320
he's,
he's,

1306
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:22,350
he's got a super athlete.
Always joke about it is whatever comes 

1307
00:57:23,501 --> 00:57:25,120
out of there.
Just Nike should sponsor.

1308
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:29,110
We're all super athletes.
So true.

1309
00:57:29,830 --> 00:57:30,700
It's so true.
I mean,

1310
00:57:30,701 --> 00:57:34,780
he,
his level is just right out.

1311
00:57:35,550 --> 00:57:37,000
They used to beat them up or whether 
they're just like,

1312
00:57:37,001 --> 00:57:38,600
I'm not.
The toughest one in my family is like,

1313
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:41,260
my brothers will beat my ass.
The younger brother,

1314
00:57:41,261 --> 00:57:46,261
his younger brother beat his ass.
Like his younger brother was talking 

1315
00:57:46,261 --> 00:57:49,381
about it.
Like in an interview they asked for tmz 

1316
00:57:49,381 --> 00:57:49,381
and he's like,
oh,

1317
00:57:49,381 --> 00:57:49,381
I'll beat his ass right now.
It's like,

1318
00:57:49,381 --> 00:57:51,010
what the fuck?
We don't remember when he watched,

1319
00:57:51,011 --> 00:57:51,930
uh,
uh,

1320
00:57:52,820 --> 00:57:55,570
when,
when he chokes the Oto and I'm like,

1321
00:57:55,840 --> 00:58:00,840
he doesn't even really know how to like 
I'm looking at that or when he choked 

1322
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:00,840
bader I'm like,
Yoda.

1323
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,250
Choke was a great job because he knows 
how to push.

1324
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:05,800
He's the first one doesn't cover the 
head,

1325
00:58:05,830 --> 00:58:07,060
covers the head,
but he also,

1326
00:58:07,061 --> 00:58:09,520
he pushes the arm,
you know,

1327
00:58:09,521 --> 00:58:14,521
he pushes his palm back just learning 
and sees that he's learning in these 

1328
00:58:14,521 --> 00:58:14,521
moments.

1329
00:58:14,521 --> 00:58:16,910
We so strong.
How scared I was like,

1330
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:22,280
like Beta.
He looked great against Rashad fucking 

1331
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:24,871
look like at different athletes,
but he's a different athlete over the 

1332
00:58:24,871 --> 00:58:24,871
last four fights.
Bader is,

1333
00:58:24,871 --> 00:58:28,920
he's been number back then when he would
just relied on wrestling that Jon Jones 

1334
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:33,060
fight.
When do you see a sun kissed kid 

1335
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:34,750
wrestler pull half guard like that.
And he just was like,

1336
00:58:34,751 --> 00:58:37,300
I don't want to fucking,
I don't want to get in a bad position.

1337
00:58:37,301 --> 00:58:38,530
Maybe I can hang onto this.
Yeah,

1338
00:58:38,531 --> 00:58:43,531
he was just overwhelmed.
I mean that's a kind of power that like 

1339
00:58:43,531 --> 00:58:47,580
he'd never felt in.
That's a huge top of the food chain 

1340
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:47,580
wrestler.
Like,

1341
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:51,801
let's see how special John Is.
You shouldn't look at how good glover to

1342
00:58:52,211 --> 00:58:54,490
share his looked against everybody else,
but John,

1343
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:59,520
well Phil Davis did beat his ass,
but Phil Davis beat his ass when he was 

1344
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:03,331
fighting out of Connecticut and his 
shoulder was all fucked up for the John 

1345
00:59:03,331 --> 00:59:05,290
Jones fight and there's a lot of things 
wrong with this camp.

1346
00:59:05,290 --> 00:59:09,940
Go overhead is has the right mentality 
to as far as like a stocking and getting

1347
00:59:09,941 --> 00:59:14,941
really aggressive towards cones and 
taking the center because John just 

1348
00:59:14,941 --> 00:59:15,480
takes the center of the ring and makes 
everybody running.

1349
00:59:15,481 --> 00:59:20,481
The circle around him was like.
That was one of the fascinating things 

1350
00:59:20,481 --> 00:59:24,121
about their fight.
Glover was like loading up on and John 

1351
00:59:24,121 --> 00:59:24,121
was just aware of everything and he's 
like,

1352
00:59:24,121 --> 00:59:24,510
no,
you can't fight them.

1353
00:59:24,511 --> 00:59:29,511
I know you guys are looking like they 
want to put them away and it's like he 

1354
00:59:29,511 --> 00:59:31,840
sees too much to be able to do that.
You have to really.

1355
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:33,500
How are you going to surprise him with 
one shot?

1356
00:59:33,501 --> 00:59:34,790
You know?
It's incredible though.

1357
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:37,760
When you think about that.
It's incredible that he has that sort of

1358
00:59:37,761 --> 00:59:41,930
awareness with relatively small amount 
of time striking.

1359
00:59:41,931 --> 00:59:42,750
Yep.
You,

1360
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:46,730
when you consider his entire life.
In fact it's only 27 wins.

1361
00:59:46,730 --> 00:59:48,770
The title at 23,
you know,

1362
00:59:49,070 --> 00:59:50,930
the growth is in 20,
22 or 23.

1363
00:59:50,931 --> 00:59:52,880
They want the title to 22.
Like so.

1364
00:59:53,390 --> 00:59:58,390
I mean I hate what happened with him.
I hate to see a guy run into that,

1365
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:06,080
that classic Cliche of partying and just
messing up his life and,

1366
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:09,050
and then the,
the hit and run.

1367
01:00:09,051 --> 01:00:11,390
So God damn,
I think it's that youth stuff,

1368
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:14,270
you know?
And it's the thing that I'm like,

1369
01:00:14,271 --> 01:00:19,271
I would just ask everybody to be 
gracious looking at it in that way 

1370
01:00:19,271 --> 01:00:20,150
because it's shit that maybe not 
everybody does,

1371
01:00:20,151 --> 01:00:25,151
but a lot of young dudes,
you go through that shit and he went 

1372
01:00:25,151 --> 01:00:26,600
through it at a later time maybe,
but a way public time.

1373
01:00:26,601 --> 01:00:27,320
Like he's,
you know,

1374
01:00:27,390 --> 01:00:31,760
that's the thing that when you're so 
publicized like that people are going to

1375
01:00:31,761 --> 01:00:34,870
see all your words and there's nobody 
that's walking without words.

1376
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:39,880
It's like,
that's one of the problems with the way 

1377
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:39,880
we view.
I think politics,

1378
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:39,880
I think everything,
it's like,

1379
01:00:39,980 --> 01:00:41,420
you know,
pee before the Internet,

1380
01:00:41,450 --> 01:00:44,810
like all those politicians are 
pretending that they didn't fuck kids or

1381
01:00:44,811 --> 01:00:48,360
have affairs or blood or whatever.
Come on.

1382
01:00:49,190 --> 01:00:50,290
That's jared.
Um,

1383
01:00:51,710 --> 01:00:54,140
but I know what you're saying and all 
that kind of thing.

1384
01:00:54,141 --> 01:00:56,840
And it's like when,
when you live with transparency,

1385
01:00:56,841 --> 01:00:58,760
like we have a lot more transparency 
now.

1386
01:00:58,761 --> 01:01:03,761
It's like everybody's seen.
There's no cover ups of scandals except 

1387
01:01:03,761 --> 01:01:07,031
nine slash 11.
But beyond that they chose black 

1388
01:01:07,031 --> 01:01:07,390
helicopters.
Yeah.

1389
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:08,390
I,
uh,

1390
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:13,460
I wonder if it's going to change 
politics in the future if you're going 

1391
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:13,460
to.
People are going to be forced to just be

1392
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:15,380
human and,
and that's the thing.

1393
01:01:15,381 --> 01:01:20,381
Grow and will be a real person because 
that speech type style of delivery with 

1394
01:01:20,381 --> 01:01:21,650
a not real,
you know,

1395
01:01:21,970 --> 01:01:23,550
that they do with,
you know,

1396
01:01:23,570 --> 01:01:25,380
ladies and gentlemen,
the president of United States.

1397
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:30,380
Sure.
My fellow Americans today is a day that 

1398
01:01:30,380 --> 01:01:33,230
will live in infamy of speech writers 
that have this template and they want to

1399
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:35,930
put that template.
And it's also like the tone,

1400
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:38,240
the way they,
they speak,

1401
01:01:38,270 --> 01:01:43,270
it's all fake and I always wonder like,
are we going to come to a point in time 

1402
01:01:43,270 --> 01:01:47,141
where a guy gets onstage where a woman 
gets on stage as the president and 

1403
01:01:47,141 --> 01:01:50,720
speaks like a human and says,
here's our situation.

1404
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:52,280
This is where we're at.
We have,

1405
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:57,290
we have a real problem with Syria.
We have when going to run for president.

1406
01:01:57,291 --> 01:01:58,040
We,
Kanye West,

1407
01:01:58,080 --> 01:01:59,960
I think Atlanta,
Kanye,

1408
01:01:59,961 --> 01:02:02,240
Kanye,
Kanye up and debate.

1409
01:02:02,241 --> 01:02:04,880
So for sure you would run trains on that
debate.

1410
01:02:05,810 --> 01:02:08,090
He was racing a train trying to talk 
over you.

1411
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:11,150
It has a connotation that I gave you 
your time,

1412
01:02:11,151 --> 01:02:12,320
sir.
That'd be awesome.

1413
01:02:12,321 --> 01:02:13,460
I'm not Taylor swift.

1414
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:16,580
That would be awesome.
You know,

1415
01:02:16,690 --> 01:02:17,840
I think,
I don't know,

1416
01:02:17,841 --> 01:02:18,970
I feel like uh,
you know,

1417
01:02:19,020 --> 01:02:21,180
we,
we take for granted from old ideas,

1418
01:02:21,181 --> 01:02:26,181
you know,
and it's like it goes back to polly's 

1419
01:02:26,181 --> 01:02:26,181
shorter going,
nobody knows how to do it.

1420
01:02:26,181 --> 01:02:26,970
There was no path when you make your own
path,

1421
01:02:26,971 --> 01:02:27,780
right?
That's the thing.

1422
01:02:27,781 --> 01:02:32,781
Because Paul came from standup and 
there's absolutely no path and stand up 

1423
01:02:32,781 --> 01:02:35,300
like no one because at least like with 
acting role,

1424
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:38,670
some open mics,
Fletcher,

1425
01:02:38,790 --> 01:02:40,350
let's do it.
I think the same thing.

1426
01:02:40,351 --> 01:02:42,030
I don't want to do it again.
Oh really?

1427
01:02:42,031 --> 01:02:42,810
Yeah,
he's down.

1428
01:02:42,870 --> 01:02:44,010
He wants to kill it again.
Cool.

1429
01:02:44,180 --> 01:02:47,200
You know,
I had eddie do it like he probably these

1430
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:47,950
days,
like eight times.

1431
01:02:47,951 --> 01:02:49,530
Yeah.
What did he say?

1432
01:02:49,590 --> 01:02:50,280
Well,
he was like,

1433
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:51,720
you know,
he's like,

1434
01:02:51,721 --> 01:02:53,940
I had the stroke that I thought was just
awesome and it just,

1435
01:02:54,390 --> 01:02:57,250
it was about hookers and it just didn't 
know,

1436
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:58,840
you know,
the one and uh,

1437
01:02:59,550 --> 01:03:00,930
anyway,
but you know,

1438
01:03:00,931 --> 01:03:05,931
you look at all these,
all these old ideas that people haven't 

1439
01:03:05,931 --> 01:03:08,121
even like this,
this whole stigma of like what we have 

1440
01:03:08,121 --> 01:03:08,121
low attention span.

1441
01:03:08,121 --> 01:03:08,121
We're looking at it wherever my phone 
is,

1442
01:03:08,121 --> 01:03:10,350
we're looking at our phones all the time
or this and that.

1443
01:03:10,710 --> 01:03:12,270
But you know,
you look at that and you go,

1444
01:03:12,271 --> 01:03:17,271
okay,
if I were a corporate media thing and I 

1445
01:03:17,271 --> 01:03:18,900
wanted to put out a fucking new 
entertainment thing and it's going to be

1446
01:03:18,901 --> 01:03:23,901
anywhere from an hour to three hours 
long and it's just going to be guys 

1447
01:03:23,901 --> 01:03:25,620
talking,
any corporation would be like,

1448
01:03:25,621 --> 01:03:27,690
that's never going to catch on.
We need sound bites,

1449
01:03:27,691 --> 01:03:31,740
we need MTV news like we need fuck.
And you look at podcasts and you look at

1450
01:03:31,741 --> 01:03:36,741
what they are and people are fucking 
more invested in that because it's real 

1451
01:03:36,741 --> 01:03:37,920
because there's authentic voices to it.
Well,

1452
01:03:37,921 --> 01:03:42,921
you know,
that was one of the number one things 

1453
01:03:42,921 --> 01:03:42,921
that people said to me when I first 
started out,

1454
01:03:42,921 --> 01:03:46,461
like,
you can't do three hour podcasts right 

1455
01:03:46,461 --> 01:03:46,461
now.

1456
01:03:46,461 --> 01:03:46,461
Why or why not?
And they said,

1457
01:03:46,590 --> 01:03:51,590
well,
because no one's going to listen to 

1458
01:03:51,590 --> 01:03:51,590
three hours.
I go,

1459
01:03:51,590 --> 01:03:51,590
well,
they don't have to write.

1460
01:03:51,590 --> 01:03:51,600
You can just shut it off like I don't 
get it.

1461
01:03:51,660 --> 01:03:55,440
That's why I had like an argument is 
about as long as you just having fun.

1462
01:03:55,441 --> 01:03:57,990
Who gives a fuck our.
He was adamant about it.

1463
01:03:57,991 --> 01:03:59,970
You have to enter your podcast.
I'm just telling you right now,

1464
01:04:00,030 --> 01:04:01,470
you have to edit your podcast.
I go,

1465
01:04:01,471 --> 01:04:02,370
why?
He goes,

1466
01:04:02,371 --> 01:04:03,390
because it's too long.
I go,

1467
01:04:03,391 --> 01:04:03,940
well,
so what?

1468
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:08,070
What does that mean?
And also more importantly is that a road

1469
01:04:08,071 --> 01:04:11,400
that you've walked you have experienced 
with yours being too long,

1470
01:04:11,401 --> 01:04:14,940
but everybody was compelling but nobody 
had any experience at all.

1471
01:04:15,030 --> 01:04:17,190
But they thought about it like a comedy 
central show,

1472
01:04:17,191 --> 01:04:21,210
like an hour long show,
which then speaks to the thing about old

1473
01:04:21,211 --> 01:04:22,440
stuff,
old ideas.

1474
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:25,460
You've got to put away your old ideas if
you want to be on the tip of the sphere.

1475
01:04:26,210 --> 01:04:26,940
Don't even think.
I mean,

1476
01:04:26,941 --> 01:04:31,020
my point of view was like you and I long
before we ever did podcast,

1477
01:04:31,770 --> 01:04:35,610
we always had these conversations before
a show or after show or hanging out.

1478
01:04:35,730 --> 01:04:38,040
We would talk for hours,
hours and hours.

1479
01:04:38,041 --> 01:04:42,330
And it seemed to me like a half hour 
into the conversation or 45 minutes,

1480
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:44,500
shit just started getting cookie,
you know?

1481
01:04:44,550 --> 01:04:45,120
And then,
you know,

1482
01:04:45,121 --> 01:04:46,440
an hour later we're like,
yeah,

1483
01:04:46,441 --> 01:04:46,890
yeah,
yeah,

1484
01:04:46,891 --> 01:04:48,000
yeah.
And then blah blah blah.

1485
01:04:48,140 --> 01:04:51,930
And then the stories come out and I 
remember this one time and those are the

1486
01:04:51,931 --> 01:04:54,600
fun conversation and you get to know 
each other and then,

1487
01:04:54,930 --> 01:04:57,000
and then he would make that into an 
audience and the fuck.

1488
01:04:57,001 --> 01:04:59,290
Then they get to know you and then 
there's not like,

1489
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:01,410
you know,
there's not all this,

1490
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:04,770
uh,
these barriers between us all.

1491
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:09,800
We're all,
we all see our similarities and there's 

1492
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:09,800
less dissension.
There's less animosity,

1493
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:14,421
there's more understanding,
there's more graciousness and 

1494
01:05:14,421 --> 01:05:14,421
generosity.
And like,

1495
01:05:14,421 --> 01:05:18,231
if we could get that way with everybody,
if everybody felt that way instead of 

1496
01:05:18,231 --> 01:05:21,741
this corporate dominion though,
here's what CNN says that we need this 

1497
01:05:21,741 --> 01:05:24,721
to be.
You have direct feedback from other 

1498
01:05:24,721 --> 01:05:24,721
people about what you're doing.
Right?

1499
01:05:24,721 --> 01:05:26,800
And that feedback has been super 
valuable to me,

1500
01:05:26,801 --> 01:05:28,270
man.
Even the negative stuff,

1501
01:05:28,271 --> 01:05:33,271
the negative stuff like you don't,
nobody likes to hear criticisms about 

1502
01:05:33,271 --> 01:05:33,670
what they do,
but if you consider it and find warriors

1503
01:05:33,671 --> 01:05:38,671
enter a truth in that,
you could find out a lot about your 

1504
01:05:38,671 --> 01:05:41,971
style or of you just interviewing people
or talking to people where you make 

1505
01:05:41,971 --> 01:05:43,210
mistakes and you're not.
No one's perfect.

1506
01:05:43,211 --> 01:05:44,890
You're not going to make mistakes.
I mean,

1507
01:05:44,891 --> 01:05:48,700
you're not going to have a podcast that 
every word comes out perfect.

1508
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:51,970
It's just not possible because you're 
free dollar ads.

1509
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:53,450
Yeah.
I freaking lost.

1510
01:05:53,460 --> 01:05:55,900
You stumble on all the time and it 
doesn't fucking matter.

1511
01:05:55,950 --> 01:05:58,620
But if somebody were dragging,
yeah,

1512
01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:00,670
they would want to do it again.
Do it again.

1513
01:06:00,730 --> 01:06:02,430
We're going to do it again.
You don't have.

1514
01:06:02,470 --> 01:06:04,080
I mean sometimes I have to do it again.
Sure.

1515
01:06:04,870 --> 01:06:09,870
But the reality is that this,
this medium is new and no one had it 

1516
01:06:10,901 --> 01:06:15,901
before and this medium is like they gave
these kids the controls like the gave 

1517
01:06:16,511 --> 01:06:21,511
these kids the ability to broadcast a 
radio show and then they just did it 

1518
01:06:21,511 --> 01:06:21,820
their way and then it go,
well,

1519
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:26,880
why don't we just start talking?
Let's just see what happens if we don't 

1520
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:30,811
have commercials in the middle of.
The thing is like as long as you're 

1521
01:06:30,811 --> 01:06:30,811
having fun,
was the person involved in it?

1522
01:06:31,450 --> 01:06:32,900
Who gives a fuck?
It doesn't.

1523
01:06:32,950 --> 01:06:35,170
It doesn't matter what the result is.
In a way it's like,

1524
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:39,040
it's Kinda like it's like a fight or a 
comedy sketch or what?

1525
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:44,280
When you go up and you try a joke,
it's like there's not an and you're 

1526
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:44,890
trying to figure it out and do it the 
best you can in real time.

1527
01:06:45,030 --> 01:06:47,680
Right in real time with no script and 
no,

1528
01:06:47,681 --> 01:06:52,681
but that's like being in competition.
It's competition is where greatness 

1529
01:06:52,681 --> 01:06:56,911
happens.
People figure shit out in the crazy way 

1530
01:06:56,911 --> 01:06:57,790
inside of that kind of pressure and so 
if you step on stage,

1531
01:06:57,970 --> 01:07:00,280
you've got an increased amount.
It's not like you're in your living room

1532
01:07:00,310 --> 01:07:02,050
in front of your mirror trying to say a 
fucking joke.

1533
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:05,500
It means something different so you grow
more in that competition.

1534
01:07:05,590 --> 01:07:07,800
The second mean more the fucking 
moments.

1535
01:07:07,810 --> 01:07:10,120
Meanwhile,
all of that stuff and you don't get that

1536
01:07:10,121 --> 01:07:13,650
if you're not willing to throw it out 
and expose yourself live and that's like

1537
01:07:13,660 --> 01:07:14,860
putting this live on the Internet.

1538
01:07:14,860 --> 01:07:19,860
Like that's a huge exposure and either 
you're an authentic person that's got 

1539
01:07:19,860 --> 01:07:21,130
something or you don't.
And and it becomes like.

1540
01:07:21,131 --> 01:07:26,131
I think it's super visible and I think 
it's super important that we all get to 

1541
01:07:26,131 --> 01:07:28,150
that instead of all these masks that we 
wear all the time.

1542
01:07:28,151 --> 01:07:28,760
You know,
it's like,

1543
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:31,140
and to me it doesn't matter if you're 
like,

1544
01:07:31,150 --> 01:07:32,500
it's like,
it's like,

1545
01:07:32,650 --> 01:07:37,650
it's like,
are you saying that I'm sure if he only 

1546
01:07:37,650 --> 01:07:38,680
feels differently now laughs about it,
but like if you're.

1547
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:40,540
So does that mean that you don't have a 
conversation?

1548
01:07:40,541 --> 01:07:42,220
This is more than 15 minutes with your 
friend,

1549
01:07:42,620 --> 01:07:47,620
like 40 minute thing.
It's just like he thought it had to be 

1550
01:07:47,620 --> 01:07:48,820
like an hour because a show is an hour 
but not a real hour,

1551
01:07:48,821 --> 01:07:50,770
42 minutes because we got to have to out
for commercials.

1552
01:07:52,780 --> 01:07:55,590
Most people do the commercials in the 
middle of Shit too,

1553
01:07:55,830 --> 01:07:57,180
you know?
And I was like,

1554
01:07:57,190 --> 01:07:59,740
man,
I tried what you ever watch that show?

1555
01:07:59,741 --> 01:08:01,200
Uh,
there's a new fear.

1556
01:08:01,220 --> 01:08:05,790
The walking dead is the new walk now 
seeing an ad for a really dope.

1557
01:08:05,850 --> 01:08:10,850
So good.
I thought the walking dead was going to 

1558
01:08:10,850 --> 01:08:10,850
be shit.
And I watched it and I was like,

1559
01:08:10,850 --> 01:08:13,300
and then I watched like six or 10 
episodes and I was like,

1560
01:08:13,390 --> 01:08:15,350
this is stupid.
It's the same episode again.

1561
01:08:15,351 --> 01:08:20,351
And then I watched another 20 episodes.
I just couldn't stop watching it no 

1562
01:08:20,351 --> 01:08:23,350
matter what.
Fear the walking dead is interesting 

1563
01:08:23,350 --> 01:08:25,430
because it's less special effects.
Got Less zombies and it's better and the

1564
01:08:25,431 --> 01:08:26,750
fucking,
the way it's shot,

1565
01:08:26,930 --> 01:08:31,930
it's shot so well.
Whoever the director is and whoever the 

1566
01:08:31,930 --> 01:08:34,430
cinematographer is or the cameras that 
bad motherfuckers because they,

1567
01:08:34,650 --> 01:08:35,220
they,
they,

1568
01:08:35,330 --> 01:08:36,650
it's done so well.

1569
01:08:36,650 --> 01:08:39,380
It sounds like a really good movie.
It's cool and isn't.

1570
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:41,360
There's very few cut the shit moments in
it.

1571
01:08:41,361 --> 01:08:46,361
It's really good.
This new show that's coming out is a 

1572
01:08:46,361 --> 01:08:47,870
westworld world.
This show with Anthony Hopkins.

1573
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:49,940
Is that like the old movie with Yule 
Brenner?

1574
01:08:49,941 --> 01:08:53,060
Yeah.
Same Shit at Harris and Anthony Hbo.

1575
01:08:53,061 --> 01:08:58,061
What I was going to say is I watched 
that show the other day for the first 

1576
01:08:58,061 --> 01:09:00,020
time.
I usually watch it on apple TV,

1577
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:02,930
apple TV.
The other night I watched it on TV,

1578
01:09:02,931 --> 01:09:05,270
TV and I sat through the fucking 
commercials.

1579
01:09:05,290 --> 01:09:07,700
I can't do that shit.
I can't do commercials.

1580
01:09:07,701 --> 01:09:10,550
It's ruthless and that's the thing is tv
is going away.

1581
01:09:10,551 --> 01:09:13,250
It's all going to go this digitized.
Why can't they have like,

1582
01:09:13,300 --> 01:09:15,230
who the fuck is paying for all those 
commercials?

1583
01:09:15,231 --> 01:09:20,231
Right?
Why don't they have make a big deal out 

1584
01:09:20,231 --> 01:09:22,250
of it?
Say a fucking ram trucks.

1585
01:09:22,430 --> 01:09:25,130
Ram trucks going to sponsor the whole 
fucking episode.

1586
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:27,890
We're going to have one commercial in 
the beginning.

1587
01:09:28,130 --> 01:09:31,340
Ram trucks is proud to present fear of 
the walking dead.

1588
01:09:31,580 --> 01:09:36,580
Just do it as a goddamn just to attest 
and make them dope on the superbowl 

1589
01:09:37,310 --> 01:09:38,600
commercial.
How about make one?

1590
01:09:38,601 --> 01:09:43,601
Yeah.
Make one where a guy in a fucking ram 

1591
01:09:43,601 --> 01:09:45,371
truck is running over zombies.
Crushing their heads and fucking headed 

1592
01:09:45,371 --> 01:09:45,900
off into the distance and see.
This is the thing though.

1593
01:09:46,190 --> 01:09:49,370
Driving it's old ideas.
We need to start a production company.

1594
01:09:49,371 --> 01:09:51,440
That's what I'm saying.
What else do we need to do?

1595
01:09:51,441 --> 01:09:52,700
We need to do something else.
Oh,

1596
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:56,180
we need to make native ran a little 15 
minute kids commercials.

1597
01:09:56,870 --> 01:09:58,760
I guess we're going to need that to 
kids.

1598
01:09:58,790 --> 01:09:59,960
Kids.
Short films.

1599
01:09:59,961 --> 01:10:02,240
Yeah.
We need a ranch in New Mexico.

1600
01:10:02,330 --> 01:10:04,400
New Mexico is spot.
It's a good spot,

1601
01:10:04,401 --> 01:10:05,800
but Colorado is good too.

1602
01:10:06,050 --> 01:10:11,050
I mean,
it was pretty beautiful and nice and 

1603
01:10:11,050 --> 01:10:13,271
gain rich and not all fucked up with a 
pollution yet and weeds free and legal 

1604
01:10:13,271 --> 01:10:14,810
there.
We'd screen legal if that's your thing,

1605
01:10:14,811 --> 01:10:15,950
you know,
that's my thing.

1606
01:10:16,610 --> 01:10:19,730
I like friendly and no matter what,
I don't have any use for weed and I love

1607
01:10:19,731 --> 01:10:20,510
it.
Free and legal.

1608
01:10:21,230 --> 01:10:24,080
I would like it if everything was free 
and legal.

1609
01:10:24,290 --> 01:10:25,640
We need less loss.
We do.

1610
01:10:25,670 --> 01:10:30,670
We need less laws,
less people enforcing those laws and a 

1611
01:10:30,670 --> 01:10:31,220
more common sense,
more common sense,

1612
01:10:31,310 --> 01:10:36,310
more freedom,
more allowing people to do whatever the 

1613
01:10:36,310 --> 01:10:37,820
fuck they want as long as it doesn't 
hurt people and then put restrictions on

1614
01:10:37,821 --> 01:10:39,500
shit that does hurt people that's in 
place,

1615
01:10:39,501 --> 01:10:41,090
right?
That's not in place right now.

1616
01:10:41,690 --> 01:10:46,690
Financial Shit.
Like how about the fact that none of 

1617
01:10:46,690 --> 01:10:47,470
those guys that caused the financial 
crash of 2008 or in jail so crappy about

1618
01:10:47,490 --> 01:10:52,490
that whole thing about being accountable
like I don't hang out with like if you 

1619
01:10:53,391 --> 01:10:55,610
weren't accountable for your actions are
responsible,

1620
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,080
I want to fucking hang out with you.

1621
01:10:57,370 --> 01:10:59,270
It's like it's the kind of thing and 
it's like,

1622
01:10:59,420 --> 01:11:04,420
why would I accept less from my 
politicians or from anybody that is that

1623
01:11:05,810 --> 01:11:10,810
going to be accountable?
It's like everybody's got to be held 

1624
01:11:10,810 --> 01:11:10,810
accountable and that's the way good shit
works.

1625
01:11:10,810 --> 01:11:11,000
If I started with this,
when you improve,

1626
01:11:11,030 --> 01:11:16,030
if I start fucking level surveys and 
it's a shit product or we don't do due 

1627
01:11:16,030 --> 01:11:18,350
diligence in marketing or whatever,
the fucking thing isn't,

1628
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:23,360
it fails.
Nobody's fucking bailing me out and I 

1629
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:23,360
could put all my money and vet and go 
broke.

1630
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:24,840
Like that could be the thing,
but GM,

1631
01:11:25,020 --> 01:11:27,960
they have a failing business model and 
we're going to go ahead and write them a

1632
01:11:27,961 --> 01:11:29,670
check for a trillion.
Like,

1633
01:11:29,700 --> 01:11:31,260
what?
What the fuck is that?

1634
01:11:31,590 --> 01:11:32,750
Oh,
you mean like the bail house?

1635
01:11:32,990 --> 01:11:33,900
All that shit.
It's like,

1636
01:11:33,901 --> 01:11:36,270
that doesn't make any sense.
All that too big to fail.

1637
01:11:36,270 --> 01:11:38,220
Shit.
Shit shouldn't be too big to fail.

1638
01:11:38,221 --> 01:11:43,221
Did pay back all those loans though and 
they are profitable now and they have 

1639
01:11:43,221 --> 01:11:45,090
improved and made incredible vehicles 
now.

1640
01:11:45,091 --> 01:11:48,730
So I see your point in some way.
Let Shit die,

1641
01:11:49,310 --> 01:11:54,310
but God it.
Then you'd have no 2016 corvette and 

1642
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:54,750
that thing's pretty sick.
Who needs a corvette?

1643
01:11:54,751 --> 01:11:56,310
If you drive a corvette,
you are.

1644
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:59,170
Do.
You don't have a corvette?

1645
01:11:59,180 --> 01:12:00,490
Stop it.
That's not real.

1646
01:12:01,060 --> 01:12:02,610
That's a,
that's an old school corvette.

1647
01:12:02,611 --> 01:12:05,710
It's not like one of these brand new off
the lot years.

1648
01:12:05,750 --> 01:12:10,210
Nineteen 87 corvette like stops 87,
19,

1649
01:12:10,310 --> 01:12:12,300
87.
The dark years.

1650
01:12:12,510 --> 01:12:14,970
They're all dark years after fucking 19.
What?

1651
01:12:14,971 --> 01:12:17,070
Seventy two.
Um,

1652
01:12:17,090 --> 01:12:18,650
yeah,
but until about 2000.

1653
01:12:18,660 --> 01:12:20,330
Thirteen,
2014.

1654
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:22,080
The newer ones are pretty dope.
Dude.

1655
01:12:22,140 --> 01:12:24,240
You can't ever.
You're born with the Lamborghini.

1656
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:27,360
You can get corvette overlap.
Yes sir.

1657
01:12:27,420 --> 01:12:32,420
You know,
why would resale and then I would buy a 

1658
01:12:32,420 --> 01:12:32,420
truck.

1659
01:12:32,420 --> 01:12:35,500
How about at a house?
How about America and keep America 

1660
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:35,500
strong.
Cuban American.

1661
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:38,460
The best thing about keep America strong
as what they pull the uh,

1662
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:42,330
the uh,
the NASA space shuttle with.

1663
01:12:43,420 --> 01:12:45,600
What did they poach?
A Toyota Tundra.

1664
01:12:45,690 --> 01:12:48,510
Oh no,
that's awful.

1665
01:12:48,770 --> 01:12:50,130
Hundred percent awesome.
Good,

1666
01:12:50,220 --> 01:12:50,820
good,
good.

1667
01:12:50,950 --> 01:12:52,650
I'm like,
how did that get through?

1668
01:12:52,830 --> 01:12:55,050
Toyota are good trucks.
Fuck yeah,

1669
01:12:55,070 --> 01:12:57,580
that's my favorite tacoma.
They don't like.

1670
01:12:57,650 --> 01:13:00,960
They don't ever break.
They're coming out with a diesel too.

1671
01:13:00,961 --> 01:13:01,530
I heard.
Well,

1672
01:13:01,531 --> 01:13:03,480
that's why everybody fell in love with 
those land cruisers.

1673
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:06,690
They used to say in Africa,
if you want to get into the Bush,

1674
01:13:06,691 --> 01:13:08,250
you bring a range rover,
you want to get out,

1675
01:13:08,251 --> 01:13:09,360
you bring a Land Cruiser.
That's,

1676
01:13:09,620 --> 01:13:14,620
and that's why I love that Dude John,
because he's all about making it last 

1677
01:13:14,620 --> 01:13:16,320
forever instead of all these like,
oh,

1678
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:19,410
I'd love to have a Mercedes or bmw or 
something like,

1679
01:13:19,620 --> 01:13:21,120
now that I'm able to,
it'd be great.

1680
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:22,010
Accepted it.
I'm not,

1681
01:13:22,290 --> 01:13:25,080
I just can't fucking buy something 
that's going to crap out and 60,000

1682
01:13:25,081 --> 01:13:27,320
miles they all have an expiration date 
where there's like,

1683
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:29,250
now there's real problems forever with 
the rest,

1684
01:13:29,340 --> 01:13:30,390
you know,
and I don't,

1685
01:13:30,450 --> 01:13:32,190
I don't.
It doesn't need to be that way.

1686
01:13:32,191 --> 01:13:33,630
I don't want to support that kind of 
culture.

1687
01:13:33,631 --> 01:13:35,370
That's rape culture to me.
How dare you.

1688
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:37,620
That's why I liked those lexis trucks,
those.

1689
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:43,000
I got that Lexus Infinity,
those are dope and they last forever to 

1690
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:43,800
not as good.
They look good.

1691
01:13:43,830 --> 01:13:44,820
I've had that.
Our hands.

1692
01:13:44,821 --> 01:13:47,070
I love Lexus.
The Lexus is a better truck.

1693
01:13:47,370 --> 01:13:50,400
I had a letter looking and then I got an
infinity and then I,

1694
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:51,810
you see my new,
my new.

1695
01:13:51,811 --> 01:13:54,010
I haven't seen stope spatial inside.
Yeah,

1696
01:13:54,030 --> 01:13:54,820
I'll show you.
Oh,

1697
01:13:55,050 --> 01:13:56,730
they make awesome trucks,
man.

1698
01:13:56,790 --> 01:13:59,640
They may cost some trucks.
They also the lexus trucks,

1699
01:13:59,641 --> 01:14:03,360
they're actual real four wheel drive 
truck because based off the Land Cruiser

1700
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:04,620
Platform,
so they raise up.

1701
01:14:04,860 --> 01:14:08,310
They have a locking differentials.
Like if the shit hits the fan,

1702
01:14:08,550 --> 01:14:11,070
you could actually go off roading with a
Land Cruiser.

1703
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:12,130
You can go off roading

1704
01:14:12,130 --> 01:14:14,230
with a Lexus Lx five 70.
It's the same car.

1705
01:14:15,230 --> 01:14:20,230
It's the same as a land cruiser,
but there's a lot of electronic shit 

1706
01:14:20,230 --> 01:14:20,230
that the old ones didn't have.
The old ones that.

1707
01:14:20,230 --> 01:14:25,201
What people liked about them is you 
could just drive those motherfuckers 

1708
01:14:25,201 --> 01:14:25,201
through the desert,
take them over a mountain.

1709
01:14:25,201 --> 01:14:26,130
They just,
they're so durable,

1710
01:14:26,390 --> 01:14:28,910
you know,
and Jonathan Board what he does to them.

1711
01:14:28,911 --> 01:14:33,490
It makes them way more durable.
He puts polyurea coating over the entire

1712
01:14:33,491 --> 01:14:38,491
floor of the car,
like that shit is never rusting through 

1713
01:14:38,491 --> 01:14:38,491
ever.
He puts these side,

1714
01:14:38,620 --> 01:14:43,620
these rock sliders on the side of him 
that also act as side impact means 

1715
01:14:43,620 --> 01:14:47,020
somebody hits you from the side.
He put solid steel bumpers on him.

1716
01:14:47,021 --> 01:14:52,021
American made bumpers,
these giant fucking bumpers with a 

1717
01:14:52,021 --> 01:14:55,051
winch,
a worn winch to fucking pull you at 

1718
01:14:55,051 --> 01:14:57,510
8,000
pound winch to pull you out of fucking 

1719
01:14:57,510 --> 01:14:57,910
trouble.
He's got a jerry these jerry cans in the

1720
01:14:57,911 --> 01:15:01,610
back that carry water like these,
uh,

1721
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:06,640
he puts these roof racks,
what we need for the ramp on the front.

1722
01:15:06,710 --> 01:15:10,180
That so that they don't rattle it speed.
When you're on the highway,

1723
01:15:10,190 --> 01:15:13,310
it's freedom ranch.
Let's call it the freedom.

1724
01:15:13,370 --> 01:15:18,370
Yes.
Somebody probably already took that in 

1725
01:15:18,370 --> 01:15:18,370
Texas

1726
01:15:18,370 --> 01:15:20,560
and you know what we do?
We call him Tim Kennedy to be our 

1727
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:23,981
engineer for how to,
how to do the security perimeter and 

1728
01:15:23,981 --> 01:15:24,560
what all we need in there and exactly to
survive.

1729
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:27,310
He get bored while he wanted to stay.
Like,

1730
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:30,710
I'll come visit you guys now and again,
I need adventure.

1731
01:15:31,390 --> 01:15:33,490
You have to fucking go off and do 
something.

1732
01:15:33,491 --> 01:15:34,610
And was like,
let's go shoot pigs.

1733
01:15:34,611 --> 01:15:36,050
Ota a helicopter.
That's the big thing.

1734
01:15:36,051 --> 01:15:36,690
I'm like,
let's.

1735
01:15:36,790 --> 01:15:38,150
Is that what?
He doesn't do that.

1736
01:15:38,330 --> 01:15:43,330
He's crazy.
That's my next trip to Austin to go to 

1737
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:43,330
that.
Yeah.

1738
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:43,330
Yeah.
Awesome.

1739
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:44,860
Well,
that's the thing about Texas and we want

1740
01:15:44,861 --> 01:15:49,861
to have a ranch in Texas.
They're already exist and we have game 

1741
01:15:49,861 --> 01:15:49,940
ranches and you can shoot all the pigs 
you want.

1742
01:15:50,060 --> 01:15:51,020
Well,
not just pigs,

1743
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:52,310
you could shoot.
They bring it,

1744
01:15:52,311 --> 01:15:57,311
all these African animals and so there's
no regulations on Africa that was like 

1745
01:15:57,311 --> 01:16:01,981
a,
it was one of these high fence ranches 

1746
01:16:01,981 --> 01:16:01,981
and they had a lot of that exotic game.

1747
01:16:01,981 --> 01:16:01,981
Yeah,
yeah,

1748
01:16:01,981 --> 01:16:02,360
yeah,
yeah.

1749
01:16:02,750 --> 01:16:03,710
You know,
uh,

1750
01:16:03,890 --> 01:16:06,630
you want to jump over an airplane,
jump out of an airplane,

1751
01:16:06,970 --> 01:16:09,770
you know the dude from that MTV show 
just die doing that.

1752
01:16:09,860 --> 01:16:11,840
I don't know who he is,
but my friend Andy Stumpf,

1753
01:16:12,710 --> 01:16:13,310
he,
uh,

1754
01:16:13,460 --> 01:16:14,300
he does.
He does,

1755
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:16,730
he does wing suit shit.
Fuck him.

1756
01:16:16,731 --> 01:16:19,100
So he was a seal team six guy him and 
fuck that.

1757
01:16:20,210 --> 01:16:22,220
And he's fucking,
he's wild.

1758
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:24,200
You've got to have another show.
Would you wing suit it?

1759
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:25,060
I wouldn't.
Wing suit,

1760
01:16:25,100 --> 01:16:27,680
like you got to know some shit.
I have never jumped out of an aircraft,

1761
01:16:27,890 --> 01:16:32,890
but he used to teach.
He taught my cousin who he went through 

1762
01:16:32,890 --> 01:16:34,010
buds with Andy and Andy was an 
instructor.

1763
01:16:34,011 --> 01:16:37,040
He lives in San Diego,
bring them up and him together.

1764
01:16:37,070 --> 01:16:38,110
I will.
And uh,

1765
01:16:38,170 --> 01:16:39,840
does he drink?
Oh,

1766
01:16:39,841 --> 01:16:40,760
I see.
Oh yeah,

1767
01:16:40,761 --> 01:16:41,450
I know he drinks.

1768
01:16:41,530 --> 01:16:41,960
Yeah,
he will.

1769
01:16:42,010 --> 01:16:45,410
Maybe he will enjoy some new way of or 
Cerveza live,

1770
01:16:45,430 --> 01:16:45,880
but he's,

1771
01:16:46,530 --> 01:16:49,250
he does this shit to uh,
to um,

1772
01:16:50,030 --> 01:16:51,740
do the uh,
uh,

1773
01:16:51,980 --> 01:16:55,100
the navy seal foundation.
And so all the monies go to that.

1774
01:16:55,101 --> 01:17:00,101
He is trying to break forward.
I just give them a records and the 

1775
01:17:00,101 --> 01:17:00,101
single jump.
Yeah,

1776
01:17:00,101 --> 01:17:00,101
they would love that.
I'll just give them money.

1777
01:17:00,101 --> 01:17:04,890
Yeah,
I don't wanna I don't want to jump in 

1778
01:17:04,890 --> 01:17:04,890
and helicopters.
Oh,

1779
01:17:04,890 --> 01:17:07,301
I do.
I'm going to jump onto the plane with 

1780
01:17:07,301 --> 01:17:07,301
them.
You know what's really thrilling?

1781
01:17:07,301 --> 01:17:07,301
Bowhunting.
Good enough.

1782
01:17:07,301 --> 01:17:08,620
That's good too.
But you know what dude?

1783
01:17:08,770 --> 01:17:09,940
So another friend of mine,
he

1784
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:12,740
this Army Ranger and he's fucking,
he's retired.

1785
01:17:12,741 --> 01:17:14,240
He's gone from that.
He's and he's,

1786
01:17:14,241 --> 01:17:15,260
you know,
it's weird.

1787
01:17:15,261 --> 01:17:17,780
Retired and he's 26 or something,
but he started,

1788
01:17:17,930 --> 01:17:19,700
he started fucking around with the boat 
when he got done.

1789
01:17:19,940 --> 01:17:24,940
And he's a real,
like he doesn't talk to anybody who's a 

1790
01:17:24,940 --> 01:17:26,771
real soloist,
kinda likes to go sit in the woods by 

1791
01:17:26,771 --> 01:17:28,931
himself.
And he started messing around with bows 

1792
01:17:28,931 --> 01:17:28,931
and I go,
oh,

1793
01:17:28,931 --> 01:17:29,750
you shoot a compound bow or what are you
shooting?

1794
01:17:30,290 --> 01:17:30,860
He was,
no,

1795
01:17:30,861 --> 01:17:32,120
he makes his own,
of course.

1796
01:17:32,150 --> 01:17:36,830
And so we went to recurve right first.
Then he started making his own and I go,

1797
01:17:36,831 --> 01:17:37,580
why is that?
He goes,

1798
01:17:38,090 --> 01:17:43,090
well,
because it's like the other ones like 

1799
01:17:43,090 --> 01:17:43,090
shooting a rifle.
He's like,

1800
01:17:43,090 --> 01:17:43,090
it's just,
there's nothing.

1801
01:17:43,090 --> 01:17:43,490
He says this.
And so he's like,

1802
01:17:43,660 --> 01:17:47,300
all he wants to be on horseback and 
shoot him like he's a fucking trip.

1803
01:17:47,660 --> 01:17:50,180
And that,
those guys are a trip.

1804
01:17:50,300 --> 01:17:55,300
That's some different level shit.
When you talked to those guys that are 

1805
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:57,611
special operators like that,
like I'm listening to Andy and Andy's 

1806
01:17:57,611 --> 01:17:57,800
talked and he's like,
he's talking about like,

1807
01:17:57,890 --> 01:18:00,410
oh there's a swat team guy with us 
sending you.

1808
01:18:00,490 --> 01:18:02,390
And he's talking about his MP five.
And he's like,

1809
01:18:02,690 --> 01:18:04,430
why do you have that?
And he's like,

1810
01:18:04,970 --> 01:18:08,720
that's a fucking useless weapon.
Like I hit a guy eight times in the cast

1811
01:18:08,721 --> 01:18:11,600
with that across the room and he walked 
into the other room.

1812
01:18:11,601 --> 01:18:12,770
I mean,
he laid down there,

1813
01:18:12,830 --> 01:18:15,310
but it's like,
he fucking like with the puck.

1814
01:18:15,470 --> 01:18:15,860
He's like,
well,

1815
01:18:15,861 --> 01:18:17,750
I just use it for,
for a sport,

1816
01:18:17,751 --> 01:18:19,350
for target practice because.
Oh,

1817
01:18:19,380 --> 01:18:20,750
that's okay.
Then he's like,

1818
01:18:20,751 --> 01:18:25,040
you really want to get it just right.
Just under the eyes and above the teeth.

1819
01:18:25,070 --> 01:18:26,180
You want to get in that area.

1820
01:18:26,570 --> 01:18:29,180
I'm like,
Holy Fuck,

1821
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:35,080
what anybody says above the team,
person above the teeth.

1822
01:18:35,660 --> 01:18:37,040
Oh God,
amazing.

1823
01:18:37,041 --> 01:18:39,110
And you're like,
this is one of the kindest,

1824
01:18:39,111 --> 01:18:40,730
friendliest guy.
And then you hear and you're like,

1825
01:18:40,850 --> 01:18:45,850
holy fuck.
Some of the nicest people I know were 

1826
01:18:45,850 --> 01:18:46,640
special operators.
So I talked to him too.

1827
01:18:46,641 --> 01:18:48,230
I'm like,
how come there's a.

1828
01:18:48,231 --> 01:18:50,570
He gave me a real insight into that,
about how come there's not,

1829
01:18:51,130 --> 01:18:56,130
I'm more like would withdraw from war 
from guys that are special operators 

1830
01:18:57,741 --> 01:19:00,200
than regular guys.
It's like everybody that has ptsd,

1831
01:19:00,540 --> 01:19:02,670
like there's a ton of it.
Um,

1832
01:19:02,750 --> 01:19:03,200
and he goes,
yeah,

1833
01:19:03,201 --> 01:19:04,760
there's not a lot in our community.
And I go,

1834
01:19:04,761 --> 01:19:05,570
why?
Why is that?

1835
01:19:05,571 --> 01:19:06,140
He goes,
well,

1836
01:19:06,141 --> 01:19:09,630
because if you're a regular guy on the 
ground and you're you,

1837
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:12,140
you can't engage,
you have to be reactive.

1838
01:19:12,170 --> 01:19:17,170
You have to be fired upon or whatever.
There's rules of engagement and he goes 

1839
01:19:17,170 --> 01:19:20,771
for us,
we're predators and we're going out to 

1840
01:19:20,771 --> 01:19:21,170
engage,
and so it's a different mindset.

1841
01:19:21,170 --> 01:19:26,170
You're,
you're in a place of either being 

1842
01:19:26,170 --> 01:19:26,170
defensive or offensive and if you're 
defensive,

1843
01:19:26,170 --> 01:19:28,490
you're pray in a way and you get to be 
reactive to that,

1844
01:19:28,790 --> 01:19:33,790
but he's like world hunting and he's 
like also by the time you get to that 

1845
01:19:33,790 --> 01:19:36,791
level,
you're very dialed in about who you are 

1846
01:19:36,791 --> 01:19:37,460
and what you're doing,
which is super interesting.

1847
01:19:37,550 --> 01:19:38,630
That does make sense.
He's like,

1848
01:19:38,631 --> 01:19:40,920
it's like because he talked to Tim and 
Tim's like,

1849
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:43,280
like,
that Shit's not present to him at all.

1850
01:19:43,281 --> 01:19:43,790
He's like,
yeah,

1851
01:19:43,791 --> 01:19:44,900
no,
I'm fucking.

1852
01:19:45,430 --> 01:19:47,210
When he was on the podcast,
we were talking about it.

1853
01:19:47,211 --> 01:19:48,380
He's like,
you know,

1854
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:53,440
we're talking about people that are 
throwing acid on girls that were going 

1855
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:53,440
to school.
He's like,

1856
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:53,440
yeah,
I killed those guys.

1857
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:54,220
Yeah.
Yeah,

1858
01:19:54,410 --> 01:19:57,740
and when you say it like that,
I'm right there with you.

1859
01:19:57,800 --> 01:19:58,850
Yup.
If I was there,

1860
01:19:58,851 --> 01:20:00,350
I get it.
I get it 100 percent.

1861
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:02,600
And that's the,
that's the type of guys you want.

1862
01:20:02,810 --> 01:20:03,890
Fuck,
yes.

1863
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:05,420
There's not a lot of those guys out 
there.

1864
01:20:05,570 --> 01:20:07,800
I mean there's a reason why it's so 
fucking hard

1865
01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:13,010
to become a navy seal.
There's a reason why it's so hard to be 

1866
01:20:13,010 --> 01:20:13,010
a ranger.
It's,

1867
01:20:13,010 --> 01:20:13,010
it's not.

1868
01:20:13,010 --> 01:20:17,830
No,
that's the kind of shit like marcus 

1869
01:20:17,830 --> 01:20:17,830
trail talks about.
He goes,

1870
01:20:17,830 --> 01:20:17,830
you've got to be,
you know,

1871
01:20:17,830 --> 01:20:19,500
if you get through,
but you've got to be willing to die,

1872
01:20:19,620 --> 01:20:20,610
you know?
Um,

1873
01:20:20,780 --> 01:20:21,480
you know,
my,

1874
01:20:21,510 --> 01:20:22,290
my,
uh,

1875
01:20:22,830 --> 01:20:24,090
my cousin,
he just got,

1876
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:29,120
he got,
he is in seal team two and he got a gun 

1877
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:31,430
fight and then he got shot up and he's 
recovered now and I think he just 

1878
01:20:31,430 --> 01:20:33,060
screened for seal team six and it's a 
year after his injury,

1879
01:20:33,510 --> 01:20:37,290
but two of his friends died and in the 
pool and they're in,

1880
01:20:37,291 --> 01:20:39,520
they're in training.
Yeah.

1881
01:20:39,570 --> 01:20:44,570
Then there's,
I mean it's completely controlled 

1882
01:20:44,570 --> 01:20:44,570
environment and I was like,
what the fuck?

1883
01:20:44,570 --> 01:20:44,570
You know,
what?

1884
01:20:44,570 --> 01:20:48,180
A lot of that is my friend Eric.
Chris said when he was going through it,

1885
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:52,680
they,
they make you drown and resuscitate you,

1886
01:20:52,681 --> 01:20:57,681
that it's part of the training that's 
like the beginning of buds for 

1887
01:20:57,681 --> 01:21:00,351
everybody,
but these guys are already active duty 

1888
01:21:00,351 --> 01:21:02,721
combat seals.
And I started it and then like a few 

1889
01:21:02,721 --> 01:21:02,850
weeks ago it dawned on me and I think 
about like,

1890
01:21:03,150 --> 01:21:04,740
you know,
everybody's got safety and comfort.

1891
01:21:04,741 --> 01:21:05,910
Like here's where we live,
right?

1892
01:21:06,380 --> 01:21:11,380
And then like Greg Jackson always say,
you need to be comfortable where other 

1893
01:21:11,380 --> 01:21:14,361
men are uncomfortable.
Like you need to raise your breaking 

1894
01:21:14,361 --> 01:21:14,361
point to where it's unreachable for them
and,

1895
01:21:14,361 --> 01:21:17,160
and you can smash there's right.
And like,

1896
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:22,280
so there's.
So there's safety comfort and then 

1897
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:24,291
there's death over here.
And so if you're pushing it and like a 

1898
01:21:24,540 --> 01:21:27,930
combat arena,
like for me it's a certain thing,

1899
01:21:28,650 --> 01:21:33,650
but then you get more and more,
it becomes opaque where death and your 

1900
01:21:33,650 --> 01:21:35,430
discomfort is and those guys are so used
to being uncomfortable.

1901
01:21:35,431 --> 01:21:38,190
And then the worst situations possible 
that they probably can't see it.

1902
01:21:38,191 --> 01:21:40,590
So they're underwater and a pool and 
they're doing whatever they're doing.

1903
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:42,480
And they join,
it's just too late and they don't,

1904
01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:47,640
you know,
I think it's something like that 

1905
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:48,720
probably where they're so fucking tough.
Those guys that all,

1906
01:21:48,900 --> 01:21:53,900
they,
they erase all there there warning 

1907
01:21:53,900 --> 01:21:53,900
flags,
whatever.

1908
01:21:53,900 --> 01:21:56,781
Our body puts up his warning like,
you need to stop this now or you're in 

1909
01:21:56,781 --> 01:21:56,910
danger.
I think that it just goes away for those

1910
01:21:56,911 --> 01:21:57,290
guys.
They,

1911
01:21:57,340 --> 01:21:58,580
that shit doesn't exist for them anyway.

1912
01:21:58,790 --> 01:22:00,320
There's levels of people,
man.

1913
01:22:00,321 --> 01:22:05,321
Level levels.
There's levels of competency is levels 

1914
01:22:05,321 --> 01:22:05,480
of excellence and there's levels of 
toughness.

1915
01:22:05,530 --> 01:22:10,530
Yup.
And then there's people that put 

1916
01:22:10,530 --> 01:22:10,530
themselves into situations.
You Go,

1917
01:22:10,530 --> 01:22:12,260
you know what man,
this to the average person,

1918
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:14,780
you would go,
this is just not a smart place to be.

1919
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:16,730
But to them it's,
it's home.

1920
01:22:17,030 --> 01:22:17,990
That's where they're at.

1921
01:22:18,070 --> 01:22:19,780
There is where they live.
You're like,

1922
01:22:19,781 --> 01:22:21,460
this is very uncomfortable for me.
I don't like.

1923
01:22:21,470 --> 01:22:23,500
There's a nerdist theater kicked up on 
the couch.

1924
01:22:23,501 --> 01:22:24,220
They're like,
this is great.

1925
01:22:24,340 --> 01:22:27,010
My friend Cameron Hanes sent me a text 
last night.

1926
01:22:28,290 --> 01:22:32,020
He's got awesome fucking water life.
You love that guy.

1927
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:34,110
He's in Colorado right now.
Bow Hunting.

1928
01:22:34,111 --> 01:22:36,070
He bajans constantly.
What I love about you is,

1929
01:22:36,190 --> 01:22:37,480
hold on,
I'm say he was bow hunting,

1930
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:39,460
uh,
two weeks ago with his friend Roy,

1931
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:41,230
who we,
who got him into hunting,

1932
01:22:42,430 --> 01:22:45,130
this guy from Oregon who's his best 
friend,

1933
01:22:45,220 --> 01:22:48,460
got him into hunting.
This guy's a guide up in Alaska and they

1934
01:22:48,670 --> 01:22:53,110
got a moose really difficult on during 
the middle of the fucking snow storm and

1935
01:22:53,111 --> 01:22:55,180
it was six inches of snow.
They're trudging through.

1936
01:22:55,181 --> 01:22:58,360
They had to find these moves and they 
finally got one and it was like this big

1937
01:22:58,361 --> 01:23:03,361
triumphant that moment for him.
He sent me a text yesterday that Roy 

1938
01:23:03,361 --> 01:23:05,260
died yesterday,
fell off of a cliff wall,

1939
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:09,010
sheep hunting,
700 foot drop and died.

1940
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:11,110
And this is the guy that he was just 
with.

1941
01:23:11,410 --> 01:23:14,050
And this is one of his best friends,
if not his best friend.

1942
01:23:14,380 --> 01:23:19,380
And he died the day before yesterday,
fell 700 feet.

1943
01:23:19,810 --> 01:23:22,030
And this is that.
That's what we're talking about.

1944
01:23:22,031 --> 01:23:24,640
It's like this.
Is there always that close to that?

1945
01:23:24,940 --> 01:23:29,940
I mean,
especially when you're sheep hunting 

1946
01:23:29,940 --> 01:23:29,940
these rocky,
steep,

1947
01:23:29,940 --> 01:23:29,940
steep,
steep.

1948
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:31,750
Yeah.
It's a nice travel,

1949
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:36,800
real loose gravel and,
and cameron was supposed to be sheep 

1950
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:40,111
hunting with him on that trip,
but they had to call it off because the 

1951
01:23:40,111 --> 01:23:40,270
snow was too dangerous.
It was so much snow.

1952
01:23:40,450 --> 01:23:45,450
It snowed for 10 days straight.
They couldn't get to these mountain 

1953
01:23:45,450 --> 01:23:48,181
areas and if there's snow also and 
you're trying to climb up these 

1954
01:23:48,181 --> 01:23:52,231
mountains,
you don't know what the fuck you're 

1955
01:23:52,231 --> 01:23:53,491
stepping on.
Your stepping on some blues rock 

1956
01:23:53,491 --> 01:23:53,530
underneath that snow.
The snow.

1957
01:23:53,531 --> 01:23:55,480
That's cap that's coming in and you go 
right through.

1958
01:23:55,540 --> 01:23:56,800
Right through and then you're fucked.

1959
01:23:57,190 --> 01:23:58,140
Yeah.
And uh,

1960
01:23:58,630 --> 01:24:01,630
he fell 700 feet to his death.
Crazy.

1961
01:24:01,631 --> 01:24:04,130
Yeah.
That's how.

1962
01:24:04,190 --> 01:24:06,580
How did,
how did cameron turned a corner to where

1963
01:24:06,581 --> 01:24:08,470
he was able to monetize his life to 
live.

1964
01:24:08,650 --> 01:24:12,400
It's only recently he's been doing it 
forever and he's been doing it forever.

1965
01:24:12,430 --> 01:24:13,750
He just hustled,
man.

1966
01:24:14,610 --> 01:24:16,020
Full time job.
Oh really?

1967
01:24:16,021 --> 01:24:18,610
It's a full time job.
He works for the Department of Water and

1968
01:24:18,611 --> 01:24:21,670
power and Oregon all day.
Nine hours.

1969
01:24:21,671 --> 01:24:23,260
And then he gets home.
He fucking runs.

1970
01:24:23,261 --> 01:24:25,080
He lists savage man.
He's it.

1971
01:24:25,420 --> 01:24:26,710
He's just tough as shit,
man.

1972
01:24:26,860 --> 01:24:29,410
Guy Does ultra marathon is anything.
Well,

1973
01:24:29,411 --> 01:24:31,490
he's just tough mental toughness.
Yeah.

1974
01:24:31,630 --> 01:24:36,630
That's like the main strength.
That guy has incredible mental 

1975
01:24:36,630 --> 01:24:40,081
toughness.
He's like a brother and a lot of ways 

1976
01:24:40,081 --> 01:24:40,320
with the endurance aspect of it.
Yeah,

1977
01:24:40,690 --> 01:24:42,940
that kind of thing.
Just gritty determination.

1978
01:24:43,130 --> 01:24:44,170
Just hard work,
man.

1979
01:24:44,250 --> 01:24:45,280
It's cool.
It works hard.

1980
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:47,170
Cool too because he's not in a.
it's,

1981
01:24:47,180 --> 01:24:49,400
you know like if you're a fighter,
you're a football player,

1982
01:24:49,401 --> 01:24:52,360
you're in the army or that gets directed
in a way for you,

1983
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:57,400
but that's a real soloist thing that he 
does and there's a lot of guys that 

1984
01:24:57,400 --> 01:25:01,241
hump,
but there's not a lot of guys that are 

1985
01:25:01,241 --> 01:25:02,441
like that guy who's like,
I'm going to go ahead and strap fucking 

1986
01:25:02,441 --> 01:25:02,441
bunch of plates on my back and run up 
the mountain this morning.

1987
01:25:02,441 --> 01:25:07,310
Or there's not a lot of guys that 
trained to hunt like he trains to be an 

1988
01:25:07,310 --> 01:25:07,310
apex

1989
01:25:07,310 --> 01:25:12,080
or when you hunt with them,
you realize that like he and I were 

1990
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:14,871
hunting in Colorado a couple of weeks 
ago and we went up this hill and this 

1991
01:25:14,871 --> 01:25:16,380
fucking dude runs hill.
So often I'm in pretty good shape.

1992
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:19,340
I'm falling behind.
I'm fucking huffing.

1993
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:20,350
Yeah,
I mean we're,

1994
01:25:20,351 --> 01:25:21,010
we're,
I mean,

1995
01:25:21,030 --> 01:25:23,700
I'm trying to keep up with them,
but I'm breathing heavy.

1996
01:25:23,701 --> 01:25:25,050
I got to the top with him.
I'm like,

1997
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:28,440
he's not even breathing right.
I mean,

1998
01:25:28,441 --> 01:25:30,570
he's not even fucking breathe in.
I mean he's,

1999
01:25:30,630 --> 01:25:32,370
he's fine.
He's like,

2000
01:25:32,371 --> 01:25:34,710
he could have a conversation with you.
Whereas I'm like,

2001
01:25:34,711 --> 01:25:36,160
man,
that's fucking Steve.

2002
01:25:36,660 --> 01:25:37,840
Steve.
Like,

2003
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:39,870
I'm like,
this is the difference between a guy who

2004
01:25:39,871 --> 01:25:42,680
runs hills and a guy who doesn't.
He,

2005
01:25:42,810 --> 01:25:46,830
he prepares for that specific 
environmental constantly running hills,

2006
01:25:46,831 --> 01:25:48,420
constantly lifting weights,
all that.

2007
01:25:48,810 --> 01:25:50,220
And you know,
people criticize them.

2008
01:25:50,221 --> 01:25:51,300
You don't need to do that stuff.

2009
01:25:51,300 --> 01:25:56,300
You don't need to do that stuff because 
they don't want to do it and they don't 

2010
01:25:56,300 --> 01:25:58,050
like that someone is doing it right.
But that fucking guy killed several bull

2011
01:25:58,051 --> 01:26:00,000
elk every year.
Kills Moose.

2012
01:26:00,060 --> 01:26:02,310
Every time he goes out,
he's killing something and that's all he

2013
01:26:02,311 --> 01:26:04,880
eats.
He high protein,

2014
01:26:04,910 --> 01:26:07,940
organic meat constantly and he's 
inspirational.

2015
01:26:08,060 --> 01:26:09,810
That's what I love about a man,
that guy.

2016
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:14,960
I've run into so many people that are 
inspired by that guy and he forces them 

2017
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:19,210
by just watching him.
It forces them to get off their ass and 

2018
01:26:19,210 --> 01:26:20,120
go do stuff and go,
go lift weights,

2019
01:26:20,150 --> 01:26:22,110
go work out.
I mean a guy like that you had to go and

2020
01:26:22,130 --> 01:26:25,820
if I do 15 percent of what he does,
I'm winning and he works all day,

2021
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:27,320
you know,
I didn't.

2022
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:29,780
I thought for sure that was his full 
time shit.

2023
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:34,840
Yeah.
You mentioned way more from bowhunting 

2024
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:34,840
that he does from his work.

2025
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:37,750
Crazy.
But it keeps the job he doesn't want to 

2026
01:26:37,750 --> 01:26:40,361
anymore.
I get a pension or something at the end 

2027
01:26:40,361 --> 01:26:40,361
of those.
He's got kids and insurance and all that

2028
01:26:40,361 --> 01:26:43,490
shit and that is a ton of kids to wife 
kids.

2029
01:26:43,491 --> 01:26:44,710
Whole deal.
Yeah.

2030
01:26:45,530 --> 01:26:46,370
Good.
Speaking of which,

2031
01:26:46,371 --> 01:26:48,000
I gotta get the Fuck Outta here.
Tait Fletcher.

2032
01:26:48,230 --> 01:26:49,580
We've got a days more often.

2033
01:26:49,970 --> 01:26:52,540
why don't we do this so it's fun.
Yeah.

2034
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:57,640
I love it man.
Take motherfucking Fletcher on 

2035
01:26:57,640 --> 01:26:57,640

That's tea.

2036
01:26:57,640 --> 01:26:58,790
I T I don't know who the fuck.
T a t is.

2037
01:26:59,150 --> 01:27:03,140
Not me telling them to kick rocks.
I'm new all Cerveza,

2038
01:27:03,170 --> 01:27:05,870
caveman coffee,

This shit right here.
Caveman nitro.

2040
01:27:09,170 --> 01:27:12,020
This is the shit we got our new 
packaging for our concentrate.

2041
01:27:12,620 --> 01:27:13,590
Delicious.
All that.

2042
01:27:13,591 --> 01:27:15,080
Goodness.
This stuff right here.

2043
01:27:15,081 --> 01:27:17,040
This is my all time favorite.
I know.

2044
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:18,560
Real well.
It's fucking goes through it.

2045
01:27:18,561 --> 01:27:21,210
That little cunt.
I'm going to bring them some.

2046
01:27:21,350 --> 01:27:26,350
We got.
We got pallets and pallets inside La 

2047
01:27:26,350 --> 01:27:26,350
