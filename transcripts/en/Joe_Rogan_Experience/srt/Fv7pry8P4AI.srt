1
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:06,990
Did I ever show you the picture of the
tree that was growing in my toilet pipe

2
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:09,840
now tree now dude,

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:11,280
I was having a problem.

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,030
My toilet wouldn't flush correctly,

5
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:17,850
so I had a fellow come over to
take care of it and he said,

6
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:18,390
dude,

7
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:18,751
he goes,

8
00:00:18,751 --> 00:00:19,560
look at that.

9
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,460
That's an actual picture of the
thing that was in my bathroom.

10
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:28,610
What is it that is a tree that that's
roots got into a small crack in the water

11
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:35,700
pipe and then it grows
where the water up the pipe.

12
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,220
So the pipe was clogged with like a tree.

13
00:00:38,221 --> 00:00:39,510
It looked like an animal.

14
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:40,530
Oh my God.

15
00:00:40,531 --> 00:00:41,460
It's disgusting.

16
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:42,421
That's so big.

17
00:00:42,421 --> 00:00:43,920
It looks like it has a personality.

18
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:47,100
Tell him the rest of
the trees get in here,

19
00:00:47,101 --> 00:00:47,490
Bro.

20
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:48,990
There's water and shit.

21
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:49,801
Wait a minute.

22
00:00:49,801 --> 00:00:50,310
In a pipe.

23
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:50,790
Yeah.

24
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:55,580
You live in a stew of water and shit
and they keep dropping shit on you every

25
00:00:55,581 --> 00:00:57,150
day and you absorb it.

26
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:58,030
No Way.

27
00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:58,890
You live there.

28
00:00:59,100 --> 00:00:59,281
Yeah,

29
00:00:59,281 --> 00:00:59,521
Bro.

30
00:00:59,521 --> 00:01:00,670
There's no dirt ditches,

31
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:02,430
watery and they let you live,

32
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:02,881
Bro.

33
00:01:02,881 --> 00:01:04,500
I'm telling you dirt sucks.

34
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:05,610
Fuck dude,

35
00:01:05,611 --> 00:01:07,040
that sounds shit.

36
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:07,883
Pipe.

37
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,510
He's out there hustling.

38
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,270
He made his way up to ship
pipe here about Harry.

39
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,133
Yeah Bro.

40
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:15,330
He worked at that fucking pipe for years,

41
00:01:15,331 --> 00:01:15,721
man.

42
00:01:15,721 --> 00:01:17,910
You got to admit the dude put his timing.

43
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:18,331
All right.

44
00:01:18,331 --> 00:01:20,970
There's a lot of weeds out there
that are complaining about Harry,

45
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:22,200
but these fuckers,

46
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,290
they grow real fast and then
they just stay the same size.

47
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,940
They're not hustlers.

48
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,133
I Dunno.

49
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,430
Harry seems happy,

50
00:01:29,431 --> 00:01:30,240
but could he be the,

51
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:30,660
I mean,

52
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,280
I would miss the sun personally.

53
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,420
I'd miss the sunshine.

54
00:01:33,421 --> 00:01:34,254
You say that.

55
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,040
Okay.

56
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,020
But Harry's mostly a route could be out
there in the dirt and occasionally peak

57
00:01:40,021 --> 00:01:40,810
up a little good,

58
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:41,460
pointless,

59
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,190
sad routes that have the story of the two.

60
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:45,540
The rest of their root system.

61
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:48,720
Like they there were up above and the
rest of the roots like what's going on up

62
00:01:48,721 --> 00:01:48,841
there?

63
00:01:48,841 --> 00:01:49,674
Shut the fuck up.

64
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,080
The deer's gonna eat the little saplings.

65
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:53,100
Shut the fuck up.

66
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:53,851
Hi,

67
00:01:53,851 --> 00:01:54,684
Miss Harry.

68
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,280
Yeah.

69
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,180
Harry was a hustler.

70
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,610
Harry is the Jay Z of tree roots.

71
00:01:59,611 --> 00:01:59,761
Do.

72
00:01:59,761 --> 00:02:01,650
Did you hear how he got busted wide?

73
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:02,160
Yeah.

74
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:02,993
This plumber came in.

75
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:04,770
He got an ambitious,

76
00:02:04,771 --> 00:02:05,604
they rip them out.

77
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,510
I was telling you got to stay small.

78
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,410
You get too big,

79
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:12,900
you fucking salad keys every day,

80
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,730
and that's when they come for you.

81
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:16,650
That's behind the music all over again.

82
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:18,450
That is terrible.

83
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,410
It is behind the music,

84
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:19,860
goddammit.

85
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:20,693
You're right.

86
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:21,600
How are we got too big?
