1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:02,880
Her low freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,380
So this the vidcon thing that you went to,

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:07,800
what,

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,120
who puts this together?

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:10,560
Hank and John Green.

6
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:11,723
And who are they?

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,200
The vlog brothers.

8
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,700
They're famous youtubers.

9
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:15,600
And uh,

10
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,280
I find it very interesting when it needs,

11
00:00:17,281 --> 00:00:22,190
who is calling me a shithead and garbage
human and that's a direct violation of

12
00:00:22,191 --> 00:00:23,160
our code of conduct.

13
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:24,810
And did they do anything about it?

14
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:25,733
No,

15
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,070
because she's a feminist
because she's a woman.

16
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:29,521
Oh.

17
00:00:29,521 --> 00:00:33,900
Because she gets special cause she was
in Esaw keys and because she gets special

18
00:00:33,901 --> 00:00:37,170
treatment because at this point she's
basically become the avatar feminism.

19
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,580
If she fails,

20
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,640
I swear to God I didn't know what I mean.

21
00:00:40,641 --> 00:00:42,090
Is she respected in that world?

22
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:42,471
No.

23
00:00:42,471 --> 00:00:42,541
No,

24
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:42,720
no.

25
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,553
Everyone hates her.

26
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:44,670
Why did they still proper up?

27
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:45,720
Because she's in his sock.

28
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,760
Keizan if she doesn't make any sense,

29
00:00:47,761 --> 00:00:48,090
why not?

30
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:48,923
I mean,

31
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,940
there's a myth that's built
up around to and get word.

32
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:54,930
Yes.

33
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,030
It's um,

34
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:57,900
and they've all propped her up.

35
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:00,120
They've all propped her up level,

36
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,530
said good things about him.

37
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:03,030
They've will defended her.

38
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,300
And if it turns out that
she is in fact an abuser,

39
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,690
which she did according to
the Vidcon code of conduct,

40
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,520
which is the code of conduct.

41
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:11,911
Oh,

42
00:01:11,911 --> 00:01:13,380
I can't remember it verbatim,

43
00:01:13,381 --> 00:01:14,610
but I write down a video.

44
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:15,120
Uh,

45
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,170
it's one of my latest videos.

46
00:01:16,171 --> 00:01:16,500
Um,

47
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,250
it was just a quick message
to Hank and John Green and a,

48
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,060
I know that thousands of
people email them saying,

49
00:01:21,061 --> 00:01:21,211
hey,

50
00:01:21,211 --> 00:01:21,451
look,

51
00:01:21,451 --> 00:01:25,350
she did violate your code of conduct from
a position of institutional privilege

52
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:25,950
at Vidcon.

53
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:26,761
She was on the panel.

54
00:01:26,761 --> 00:01:27,571
I didn't have a microphone.

55
00:01:27,571 --> 00:01:28,404
She had a microphone.

56
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,490
She's calling me names.

57
00:01:29,491 --> 00:01:30,930
She's accusing me of things aren't true.

58
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:31,621
She,

59
00:01:31,621 --> 00:01:35,160
and she was doing that while you were in
the audience directly looking me in the

60
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:35,850
eye.

61
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:36,271
And it was like,

62
00:01:36,271 --> 00:01:36,870
okay,

63
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:37,703
that's fine.

64
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:38,461
But,

65
00:01:38,461 --> 00:01:39,210
uh,

66
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:40,260
that's not right.

67
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,970
And they've done nothing.

68
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:43,710
They have done nothing.

69
00:01:43,711 --> 00:01:44,850
They've said nothing.

70
00:01:44,851 --> 00:01:45,684
You talk.

71
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:47,400
And then afterwards,

72
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:49,740
all I got from her fans and,

73
00:01:49,741 --> 00:01:50,310
and I mean like,

74
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:50,521
you know,

75
00:01:50,521 --> 00:01:51,810
hundreds and hundreds of messages,

76
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,400
and I've just retweeted them all night
with exactly the same language she uses

77
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,780
when she's displaying.

78
00:01:57,781 --> 00:01:57,871
Oh,

79
00:01:57,871 --> 00:01:58,860
look at that nasty messages.

80
00:01:58,861 --> 00:02:01,500
I'm guessing of people calling
me eight garbage human,

81
00:02:01,501 --> 00:02:02,640
which is what she called me.

82
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:05,910
And so she has done
absolutely nothing different.

83
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:06,421
And so I said,

84
00:02:06,421 --> 00:02:06,620
right,

85
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,453
Hank and John,

86
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,360
she's violated your code of conduct.

87
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:10,051
Her fans,

88
00:02:10,051 --> 00:02:14,400
she's incited a cyber model
harassers exactly as she claims I do.

89
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:15,990
But she has actually done this.

90
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,500
Then on the Saturday she was due to
be on a panel about cyber harassment.

91
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:24,931
See?

92
00:02:24,931 --> 00:02:29,931
But it can't be harassment when she's a
woman and you're a man because you are

93
00:02:30,001 --> 00:02:31,020
the oppressor.

94
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:34,920
So it's the same thing as racism and
the black person being raised against a

95
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:35,561
white person.

96
00:02:35,561 --> 00:02:40,561
Is it possible the only reason to do
this then to not to take no action is if

97
00:02:41,281 --> 00:02:43,110
you are highly ideological.

98
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:44,240
And interestingly,

99
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,590
it's so you feel like they're
high d I highly ideological.

100
00:02:47,591 --> 00:02:47,770
Yeah.

101
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:48,750
Incredibly biased.

102
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:49,860
But why are they,

103
00:02:49,861 --> 00:02:51,120
if they're youtube stars,

104
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:51,450
I mean,

105
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:52,290
aren't they like,

106
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:54,300
don't they understand
they're very progressive,

107
00:02:54,301 --> 00:02:54,931
very progressive.

108
00:02:54,931 --> 00:02:56,910
But you're fairly progressive
to know I'm a liberal,

109
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:57,481
I'm not progressing.

110
00:02:57,481 --> 00:02:58,590
What is the difference between a liberal,

111
00:02:58,591 --> 00:02:59,920
a liberal called sales opportunity?

112
00:02:59,921 --> 00:03:00,090
I

113
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:00,641
progressive ones,

114
00:03:00,641 --> 00:03:01,474
quality of outcome.

115
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:02,920
When I was little,

116
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,240
I told my dad,

117
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:05,320
I was like,

118
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,820
can we get rid of the apostrophe?

119
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:08,770
I was young,

120
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:09,670
I was like 12.

121
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:10,683
And he was like,

122
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,553
Huh.

123
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:12,551
And I was like,

124
00:03:12,551 --> 00:03:13,540
it's just a sucks.

125
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:14,100
Like we're,

126
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:14,790
I feel like,

127
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:15,371
like what is it?

128
00:03:15,371 --> 00:03:16,750
Like people always
mispronounce it and he's like,

129
00:03:16,751 --> 00:03:17,740
you should be proud of that.

130
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:18,640
And I was like,

131
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,473
I'm not,

132
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:20,493
and then,

133
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,333
and then

134
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,460
I remember thinking I'm not,

135
00:03:24,461 --> 00:03:27,550
it's just the Boston 13 that's rough.

136
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,000
Yeah.

137
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,421
And then,

138
00:03:28,421 --> 00:03:29,020
and then,

139
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,520
and then I started to like it,

140
00:03:30,521 --> 00:03:30,821
you know,

141
00:03:30,821 --> 00:03:31,271
cause I'm like,

142
00:03:31,271 --> 00:03:31,421
yeah,

143
00:03:31,421 --> 00:03:32,290
I guess it is my name.

144
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:32,651
Fuck it,

145
00:03:32,651 --> 00:03:33,290
you know.

146
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:33,670
Uh,

147
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:34,361
but when I was little,

148
00:03:34,361 --> 00:03:34,930
I wanted to change.

149
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:35,381
I remember,

150
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:38,560
I remember asking my parents if I could,

151
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,001
I mean,

152
00:03:40,001 --> 00:03:40,900
this is embarrassing.

153
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:47,010
I remember telling my parents that
I wanted to change my name to,

154
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:52,380
to Damien Monroe

155
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:59,380
from Chris Delea to Damien Damien Monroe.

156
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:00,543
Imagine.

157
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:03,600
Imagine if my name was Damian Monroe.

158
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,740
You would have hated me immediately.

159
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:06,041
No,

160
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:06,431
I wouldn't.

161
00:04:06,431 --> 00:04:07,750
I know cause you open minded.

162
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:08,681
Yeah.

163
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:09,240
But Dave,

164
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,080
your field Vaughn,

165
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:11,620
that's a good tentious name ever.

166
00:04:11,621 --> 00:04:12,580
My name is Theodore.

167
00:04:12,581 --> 00:04:12,971
Theodore.

168
00:04:12,971 --> 00:04:14,350
Vaughn but think about it.

169
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,191
But think about,

170
00:04:15,191 --> 00:04:17,020
this is why you didn't even know why,

171
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:22,050
why I wanted to name it because
this is so embarrassing.

172
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:22,991
I'm whatever.

173
00:04:22,991 --> 00:04:23,824
But okay,

174
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,670
because Damien was is the devil,

175
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:28,031
right?

176
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:28,510
Okay.

177
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:31,540
And then Marilyn Monroe
was like pure in my head,

178
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:32,141
so I was like,

179
00:04:32,141 --> 00:04:33,280
you have both this.

180
00:04:33,281 --> 00:04:35,280
So this was like a show Biz name Id.

181
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:36,010
I don't know.

182
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:38,140
I didn't get very far with
it obviously this time.

183
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,121
Yeah,

184
00:04:40,121 --> 00:04:40,601
same age,

185
00:04:40,601 --> 00:04:41,030
like young,

186
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:41,550
what am I?

187
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:42,011
But I was like,

188
00:04:42,011 --> 00:04:42,551
well I could call me.

189
00:04:42,551 --> 00:04:43,990
I mean I just named myself Damien Monroe.

190
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:44,973
Oh my God.

191
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:46,930
Imagine now I would hate that.

192
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:47,980
Delirious.

193
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,230
I mean we all do stupid things as
a kid and I didn't get to do that.

194
00:04:50,231 --> 00:04:51,580
Obviously my parents
wouldn't have let me do that.

195
00:04:51,581 --> 00:04:54,520
Thank God I was a fucking Weirdo man.

196
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:55,630
I would ask my parents,

197
00:04:55,631 --> 00:04:55,871
I would,

198
00:04:55,871 --> 00:04:58,960
I would ask my peers because I always
sat like this at the dinner table and I

199
00:04:58,961 --> 00:04:59,411
asked him,

200
00:04:59,411 --> 00:05:00,070
I was like,

201
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:00,341
I was like,

202
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:01,630
can you call me crazy legs?

203
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:07,000
And I remember thinking like,

204
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:07,381
oh,

205
00:05:07,381 --> 00:05:08,680
like that would be cool.

206
00:05:08,681 --> 00:05:10,420
Like if my family called me crazy legs,

207
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,220
it's Damien crazy legs.

208
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:14,850
And then they were like,

209
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:15,611
and my dad was like,

210
00:05:15,611 --> 00:05:16,270
no.

211
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:16,861
And I was like,

212
00:05:16,861 --> 00:05:19,240
but just like maybe just at
least at the dinner table,

213
00:05:19,241 --> 00:05:21,550
I remember saying that and you'd be like,

214
00:05:21,551 --> 00:05:23,410
I'm not fucking calling you crazy leg.

215
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,400
We need you Chris.

216
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:25,980
Oh my God.

217
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,030
So funny kid shit that was even younger.

218
00:05:28,031 --> 00:05:28,721
The crazy legs thing.

219
00:05:28,721 --> 00:05:28,961
It was like,

220
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:29,830
it was probably like a nine.

221
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,221
I have not,

222
00:05:31,221 --> 00:05:33,420
I've never had anyone really
tried to pick a fight with me.

223
00:05:33,421 --> 00:05:35,120
I had a guy at a concert once,

224
00:05:35,121 --> 00:05:39,510
I get all get all butthurt about me not
letting it pass in between me and this,

225
00:05:39,511 --> 00:05:40,344
this girl.

226
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:43,830
And it was standing with me cause people
kept trying to cut through to get,

227
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,630
it was at anthrax and he wanted to get,

228
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:46,681
and I'm just like,

229
00:05:46,681 --> 00:05:47,101
fuck this.

230
00:05:47,101 --> 00:05:48,960
Why do people keep trying
to walk between us?

231
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,370
Like Jesus just go around.

232
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:51,810
So eventually I'm like,

233
00:05:51,811 --> 00:05:51,991
no,

234
00:05:51,991 --> 00:05:52,920
I'm not letting anybody by.

235
00:05:52,921 --> 00:05:55,570
So I got my elbows out and people
would bump into it and then go,

236
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,101
go around.

237
00:05:56,101 --> 00:05:56,221
Well,

238
00:05:56,221 --> 00:05:56,641
this guy,

239
00:05:56,641 --> 00:05:58,380
he just going kept tapping.

240
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,233
It's just like,

241
00:05:59,270 --> 00:05:59,690
man,

242
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:00,620
fuck you dude.

243
00:06:00,621 --> 00:06:01,550
I'm sitting here with a girl,

244
00:06:01,551 --> 00:06:02,090
go away.

245
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:07,090
He was trying to give a treat and you
and your girl and so a dick rob maybe.

246
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:07,671
I mean,

247
00:06:07,671 --> 00:06:08,720
if he'd asked nicely,

248
00:06:08,721 --> 00:06:09,501
maybe he would've got one.

249
00:06:09,501 --> 00:06:09,610
Well,

250
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:09,981
I don't know.

251
00:06:09,981 --> 00:06:10,990
That's a bold ask.

252
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,833
But uh,

253
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:12,591
you know what though?

254
00:06:12,591 --> 00:06:15,230
Fortune favors the bold
and I'm a kind human being.

255
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,940
Maybe he didn't want me to rub his dick,

256
00:06:16,941 --> 00:06:17,960
but that's what he woulda got.

257
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,710
You would've got that to
give and you take sir.

258
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:22,681
So,

259
00:06:22,681 --> 00:06:23,090
uh,

260
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:26,240
the guy comes around and he finally
goes around us and then he's just,

261
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:26,871
he looks at me,

262
00:06:26,871 --> 00:06:27,081
he's like,

263
00:06:27,081 --> 00:06:27,531
hey man,

264
00:06:27,531 --> 00:06:28,251
I was trying to get through.

265
00:06:28,251 --> 00:06:28,521
And I go,

266
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:28,701
look,

267
00:06:28,701 --> 00:06:29,960
I'm standing here with this girl,

268
00:06:29,961 --> 00:06:30,794
like,

269
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:32,180
go somewhat.

270
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,690
You just go around and he's getting all,

271
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:36,650
he's getting pissed about
it cause I'm dismissing him,

272
00:06:36,651 --> 00:06:36,960
you know,

273
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,700
so eventually I'm just like,

274
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:37,821
just,

275
00:06:37,821 --> 00:06:38,061
you know,

276
00:06:38,061 --> 00:06:38,894
let's go.

277
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:40,490
Let's walk away now.

278
00:06:40,491 --> 00:06:43,300
That gets his fucking hackles
up and he's all mad and he's,

279
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:44,061
he's looking at me,

280
00:06:44,061 --> 00:06:44,331
he's like,

281
00:06:44,331 --> 00:06:45,290
you and this and that.

282
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:46,310
And I started laughing at him.

283
00:06:46,311 --> 00:06:46,660
I go,

284
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:46,840
Oh,

285
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,570
you want to,

286
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:49,760
you want to scrap because you
can't get through here is that,

287
00:06:49,761 --> 00:06:50,511
is that it is,

288
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:51,470
this is what you want to do.

289
00:06:51,471 --> 00:06:52,304
And he's just like,

290
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:52,940
well,

291
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:53,310
well,

292
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:53,631
and I go,

293
00:06:53,631 --> 00:06:53,871
okay,

294
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:54,141
okay,

295
00:06:54,141 --> 00:06:55,160
we'll just move on.

296
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,083
Oh,

297
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:58,400
fucking chest up even bigger.

298
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,331
And it's just like,

299
00:06:59,331 --> 00:07:00,800
he looks like he's going to walk away,

300
00:07:00,801 --> 00:07:01,390
whatever I'm saying,

301
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:01,731
all right.

302
00:07:01,731 --> 00:07:02,031
You know?

303
00:07:02,031 --> 00:07:02,650
Okay,

304
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:03,381
do your own thing.

305
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:03,680
He's like,

306
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,130
Ooh,

307
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:07,190
he's just getting even more looked up
and funny points his finger out and I'm

308
00:07:07,191 --> 00:07:07,821
laughing at him.

309
00:07:07,821 --> 00:07:09,500
And the girl who,

310
00:07:09,501 --> 00:07:10,070
uh,

311
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:10,710
who was,

312
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:11,030
uh,

313
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,380
does Jujitsu and was a fighter,

314
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,650
she reaches out and grabs the whole
disguise risks and pulls his hand out and

315
00:07:15,651 --> 00:07:15,951
she's like,

316
00:07:15,951 --> 00:07:17,120
don't you don't want to do that.

317
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,160
And then he looks at her and he looks
at me and I'm just smiling and he pulls

318
00:07:22,161 --> 00:07:23,210
his hand back and I go,

319
00:07:23,211 --> 00:07:25,790
I know what must have gone
through his head is just like,

320
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,340
this girl's grip is serious.

321
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:30,050
And she's telling me,

322
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,280
don't fucking do it.

323
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,860
It's probably a good idea
not to fucking do it,

324
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,060
probably exactly what.

325
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,560
But other times there have been like,

326
00:07:36,561 --> 00:07:37,130
uh,

327
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:37,580
you know,

328
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:40,130
I'm not impervious to getting an a mood.

329
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:44,570
And so sometimes I've been out and about
and someone was being a dickhead and I

330
00:07:44,571 --> 00:07:45,410
see it and it's like,

331
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:46,303
okay,

332
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:46,960
this is,

333
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,220
he's,

334
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,730
he's clearly trying to
egg something on somehow.

335
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,520
And so maybe I,

336
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:53,383
you know,

337
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,310
add a little something to that scene,

338
00:07:55,311 --> 00:07:56,220
a feel if he'll,

339
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:56,780
uh,

340
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,440
he'll bite and just happen,

341
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:00,080
you know,

342
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,370
or I've had some people go,

343
00:08:01,371 --> 00:08:02,001
oh yeah,

344
00:08:02,001 --> 00:08:02,301
of course.

345
00:08:02,301 --> 00:08:03,021
No one's going to fight you.

346
00:08:03,021 --> 00:08:03,561
They know who you are.

347
00:08:03,561 --> 00:08:03,801
I'm like,

348
00:08:03,801 --> 00:08:04,760
are you fucking kidding me?

349
00:08:04,761 --> 00:08:06,200
I'm some sort of d list celebrity.

350
00:08:06,201 --> 00:08:07,610
Nobody knows who the fuck I am.

351
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,230
So get away with a lot.

352
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:10,790
And the thing is,

353
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:12,080
if a guy who had a fight,

354
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,250
he would know who you are.

355
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:13,550
Oh fuck.

356
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:14,810
I was a fan of fighting.

357
00:08:14,811 --> 00:08:15,800
He would know who you are.

358
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:18,320
And those guys would be way less
likely to pick a fight in the first,

359
00:08:18,321 --> 00:08:21,680
there was one dude who was at this
bar and Fullerton and he's being just

360
00:08:21,681 --> 00:08:22,161
belligerent.

361
00:08:22,161 --> 00:08:23,660
He's being an asshole and this place and,

362
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,100
and my buddy hammer,

363
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,100
he was the door guy at the time
and the southern and they're like,

364
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:28,881
come on and he's,

365
00:08:28,881 --> 00:08:30,410
this guy's fucking getting all riled up.

366
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,260
And I'm standing there with hammer
and just looking at this dude.

367
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:36,770
And eventually the other tour
guy comes over and he's like,

368
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:37,251
hey,

369
00:08:37,251 --> 00:08:38,540
you fucking dumb ass.

370
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,870
You're wearing the fucking tee
shirt of that guy right there.

371
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,790
So maybe you might want
to shut the fuck up.

372
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,590
It's this guy's wearing one
of my affliction shirts.

373
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,320
And the guy looks at the shirt
and he looks at me and he's like,

374
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,213
Oh shit,

375
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,940
this is stupid.

376
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,040
Getting your ass kicked because

377
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,910
you picked a fight with a guy
whose shirt you have on like you,

378
00:08:59,911 --> 00:09:00,301
you are,

379
00:09:00,301 --> 00:09:02,040
you're wearing a Josh Barnett shirt.

380
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:11,960
Yeah.
