1
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:02,910
Okay.

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:03,540
Good,

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:04,020
good,

4
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:04,470
good.

5
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:05,010
All right man.

6
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:05,761
John Ghoshal.

7
00:00:05,761 --> 00:00:06,594
What's up buddy?

8
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:07,081
I say right.

9
00:00:07,081 --> 00:00:07,710
Got Y'all.

10
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:08,250
Got Y'all.

11
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:09,000
You got it.

12
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,080
It's not that difficult.

13
00:00:10,081 --> 00:00:11,070
It just looks difficult.

14
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:11,610
Right,

15
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:12,030
right,

16
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:12,620
right.

17
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:12,870
Uh,

18
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:14,070
the fighter in the cage.

19
00:00:14,071 --> 00:00:15,960
So a professor rather in the cage.

20
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:20,490
I got your book right here and I was
fascinated when I heard the concept and,

21
00:00:20,491 --> 00:00:20,730
uh,

22
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,740
even more fascinated to
talk to you about this.

23
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:28,280
You decided to write a book about taking
up mixed martial arts and competing.

24
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:31,010
Yeah.

25
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:31,330
What,

26
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,610
what caused this,

27
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:33,690
this bug?

28
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:34,351
Well,

29
00:00:34,351 --> 00:00:38,280
I was working as a English instructor
at a small Liberal Arts college and

30
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,180
western Pennsylvania,

31
00:00:39,181 --> 00:00:40,170
just outside of Pittsburgh.

32
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,480
And I was pushing up on middle age.

33
00:00:42,481 --> 00:00:42,780
I was,

34
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,700
I think I was 38 and a half at the time.

35
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:45,880
And I was,

36
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,713
yeah,

37
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:48,860
I don't know why I did that.

38
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:49,760
It's like five year old,

39
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:50,150
you know,

40
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,460
I don't know why I did the
little kids in my house be,

41
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:53,330
that's why I do.

42
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:53,940
Um,

43
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,180
so I was 38 and a half at
the time and I was sort of,

44
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:57,850
I dunno,

45
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:59,970
as career wasn't going that well.

46
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:03,690
I had never made an under the tenure
track and it looked like I was never going

47
00:01:03,691 --> 00:01:03,840
to.

48
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,310
So I sort of needed something new in life.

49
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:09,840
And one day I'm at my office hours and
I happened to look out the front window

50
00:01:09,841 --> 00:01:12,840
and they used to be this auto part store
across the street about as far away as

51
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,210
a not gonna hit it with
a snowball if I threw it.

52
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:20,040
And this new business had moved in and
it was called Mark Schrader's Academy of

53
00:01:20,041 --> 00:01:21,300
mixed martial arts.

54
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:26,050
And I said stood there at the window
and I could see the guys in the cage see

55
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:26,701
seemed dancing,

56
00:01:26,701 --> 00:01:27,031
hitting,

57
00:01:27,031 --> 00:01:27,541
tackling,

58
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:28,374
rolling.

59
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,620
And I had this unexpected
emotion and the emotion was envy.

60
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:32,880
I envied them.

61
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,320
They seem so alive over there.

62
00:01:34,321 --> 00:01:35,280
So courageous.

63
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,290
I felt like I was sorta rotting away,

64
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:37,800
you know,

65
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,120
in my life and my cubicle.

66
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:40,373
Um,

67
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:43,650
and so I had this sort of funny thought
into my head and his thought was this a

68
00:01:43,651 --> 00:01:44,760
joke at my own expense?

69
00:01:44,761 --> 00:01:45,594
And the joke was,

70
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,390
wouldn't it be funny if I went
across the street and join them?

71
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:49,680
You know me cause I'm an,

72
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,450
I have this incredibly civilized job.

73
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,790
I've literally never
been in a fight before.

74
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,470
I'm almost 40 and I'm very good shape.

75
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:56,320
Um,

76
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,210
and then the next thought was,

77
00:01:57,211 --> 00:01:57,340
well,

78
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:57,840
you know,

79
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,680
maybe there's a book in that,

80
00:01:58,681 --> 00:02:01,290
it's sort of nonfiction
version of fight club.

81
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,280
I go across the street,

82
00:02:02,281 --> 00:02:03,330
I tried to learn how to fight.

83
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,800
And along the way though,

84
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:06,210
I'd be asking these sort of big,

85
00:02:06,211 --> 00:02:06,481
deep,

86
00:02:06,481 --> 00:02:10,080
eternal questions about the role that
violence has played in human life.

87
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:15,810
Now there's a difference between
violence in terms of like people perceive

88
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,040
violences Vic,

89
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,330
there's being a victim.

90
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:19,140
Yes.

91
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,420
And that's the violence that I think that
everybody has a problem with what you

92
00:02:22,421 --> 00:02:25,570
are engaging in his martial arts and the,

93
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:29,370
although violent action
happens in martial art overall,

94
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,990
it sounds contradictory.

95
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:31,470
Yes.

96
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,420
Not necessarily about violence.

97
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,590
Yeah,

98
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,880
I think that's exactly right.

99
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:36,840
I think that's exactly right.

100
00:02:36,841 --> 00:02:37,740
And that was my journey.

101
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:38,970
So I go,

102
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:39,300
you know,

103
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,880
when I'm first looking at the
cage from across the street,

104
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:45,700
I'm looking at it with all the stereotypes
that most outsiders have about the

105
00:02:45,701 --> 00:02:46,021
sport.

106
00:02:46,021 --> 00:02:46,860
And to me it looks really,

107
00:02:46,861 --> 00:02:47,694
really violent.

108
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:48,121
Um,

109
00:02:48,121 --> 00:02:50,580
I assume that the guys over
there must be of a screw loose.

110
00:02:50,581 --> 00:02:51,600
They must be savages.

111
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:52,763
Um,

112
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,530
and so I went over there to test a theory.

113
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:56,520
The theory was,

114
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:57,390
well,

115
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:58,223
you know,

116
00:02:58,650 --> 00:02:59,483
there's a,

117
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:04,090
at the core of human nature and mixed
martial arts is a perfect metaphor for it,

118
00:03:04,091 --> 00:03:06,550
for this violence at the
heart of human nature.

119
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,930
And then I go over there
and I find that my,

120
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:10,180
my theory isn't very good.

121
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:10,860
Um,

122
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:11,980
and what's happening over there?

123
00:03:11,981 --> 00:03:12,814
It's rough.

124
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,820
It's often bloody and painful,

125
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,920
but it's not really quite even violence.

126
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:18,790
I agree.

127
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:19,270
You know,

128
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:21,520
because the emotions
behind it are not angry.

129
00:03:21,521 --> 00:03:22,420
Emotions are not,

130
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,340
they're not the emotions of a,

131
00:03:24,341 --> 00:03:26,740
of violence or rage.

132
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:27,011
You know,

133
00:03:27,011 --> 00:03:27,500
there's the,

134
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,210
the basic,

135
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:28,510
uh,

136
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:29,740
competitive emotions.

137
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,880
And it's also in order to
achieve a very high level,

138
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:36,790
you have to achieve
something of a zen state.

139
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:40,060
And that Zen state can
be fucked up by emotion.

140
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:40,530
Yeah.

141
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:41,370
It'd be tripped up.

142
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,730
Your training can be tripped up.

143
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,520
You decisions made under
the duress of emotion,

144
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,110
the worst decisions.

145
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:47,471
Right.

146
00:03:47,471 --> 00:03:47,621
Yeah.

147
00:03:47,621 --> 00:03:48,610
That was one of the things that,

148
00:03:48,611 --> 00:03:48,910
uh,

149
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:51,380
the instructor that the main instructor
had gotten a mark Schrader warned.

150
00:03:51,381 --> 00:03:53,620
That's about all the time
simply because guys get mad,

151
00:03:53,621 --> 00:03:54,640
they get hit and they get mad.

152
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:54,830
You know,

153
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:55,840
it's like don't get mad.

154
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,980
It ruins everything.

155
00:03:56,981 --> 00:03:57,131
You know,

156
00:03:57,131 --> 00:03:57,341
you don't,

157
00:03:57,341 --> 00:03:58,121
you make bad decisions.

158
00:03:58,121 --> 00:03:59,140
You also get tired,

159
00:03:59,650 --> 00:03:59,930
tired.

160
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:00,763
You have to get mad.

161
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:01,720
You get,

162
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:05,610
you also really get mad when you
chase someone to try to get back half.

163
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:06,130
Right.

164
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:09,310
Then you have bad management of energy.

165
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:10,090
There's,

166
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:14,650
there's so much involved in any
sort of martial arts competition,

167
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:14,981
any,

168
00:04:14,981 --> 00:04:19,180
any sort of martial arts training that
you don't see unless you engage in it.

169
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:19,960
Yeah.

170
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,201
Yeah.

171
00:04:20,201 --> 00:04:23,800
It was tremendously valuable to me to
do this because at times I thought,

172
00:04:23,801 --> 00:04:23,981
well,

173
00:04:23,981 --> 00:04:24,580
you know,

174
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:27,570
I'm not the first writer who
had the idea to go and get,

175
00:04:27,571 --> 00:04:29,050
get in a fight and write about it.

176
00:04:29,051 --> 00:04:29,171
You know,

177
00:04:29,171 --> 00:04:30,760
George Plimpton did it same.

178
00:04:30,761 --> 00:04:32,860
Sheridan did and we've had
shared it on your show.

179
00:04:32,861 --> 00:04:35,710
He wrote a great book about
it and a couple of other guys.

180
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,120
Um,

181
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,300
so I wasn't the first to do it,

182
00:04:37,301 --> 00:04:37,690
but,

183
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:40,630
and so as a sort of publicity stunt,

184
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:41,590
that's not really why I did it.

185
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:45,550
I did it because you really don't know
anything about it unless you'd done it.

186
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,540
Unless you've gone over there and gotten
into the cage and been sort of locked

187
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:50,321
up inside there,

188
00:04:50,321 --> 00:04:52,360
they literally fuck you
up in there half naked,

189
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:52,961
you know,

190
00:04:52,961 --> 00:04:54,370
and you're with this other
guy and this other guy,

191
00:04:54,371 --> 00:04:55,210
it's really scary.

192
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:55,421
You know,

193
00:04:55,421 --> 00:04:58,630
he's a savage killer and the
only way he get out of that cage,

194
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:00,220
it's just somehow survive.

195
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,460
These next few minutes you're going to,

196
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:02,920
you're going to spend with this guy.

197
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,680
So there's an intensity to
that thing that you know,

198
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:07,660
is there when you watch
it from the outside,

199
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,520
but it's much different
to actually feel it,

200
00:05:09,521 --> 00:05:10,870
to feel what's actually happening to you,

201
00:05:10,871 --> 00:05:12,940
to feel what it's like to get
punched in the face really hard.

202
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,170
Um,

203
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:17,230
it was a tremendously educational
experience to actually do it.

204
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,510
Did it change the way?

205
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:24,190
Like did you watch martial arts before
that or were you like really an outsider

206
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:24,461
when you,

207
00:05:24,461 --> 00:05:24,640
if,

208
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,200
did you watch any UFC matches?

209
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:26,471
Dude,

210
00:05:26,471 --> 00:05:27,580
I've been a fan forever.

211
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,593
Forever.

212
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:28,930
Uh,

213
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:32,780
but you still had like some preconceived
notions when you saw the change?

214
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:33,580
Yeah,

215
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,410
I wanted to figure things out about it.

216
00:05:35,411 --> 00:05:36,640
Like why do I watch this?

217
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:37,450
You know,

218
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:39,340
because when I first started watching it,

219
00:05:39,341 --> 00:05:40,540
I had a really good excuse.

220
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,740
I was in my early twenties,

221
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:46,741
it was about 1995 and I was a committed
but basically an APP to karate student.

222
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:53,430
And the UFC was a tremendous education
about what worked in a fight and what

223
00:05:53,441 --> 00:05:54,640
absolutely did not.

224
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:59,480
And most of the stuff that I was learning
in my karate class is absolutely did

225
00:05:59,481 --> 00:06:00,314
not work.

226
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:01,303
You know what I mean?

227
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,200
And,

228
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:02,360
uh,

229
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,510
so I,

230
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,470
I was not new to the UFC was
not new to cage fighting,

231
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,370
but I had a very much of an
outsider's perspective on it.

232
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:10,940
And,

233
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:11,320
um,

234
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,450
and I was confused about what draws
people to these kinds of spectacles.

235
00:06:14,451 --> 00:06:16,880
What draws people not only
to compete in the cage.

236
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:17,870
That's an interesting question,

237
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:22,910
but also what draws people to watch
combat sports or watch other forms of

238
00:06:22,911 --> 00:06:24,590
violence back to call
people who are decent,

239
00:06:24,591 --> 00:06:25,820
civilized human beings.

240
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,890
Why do we want to watch this stuff now?

241
00:06:27,891 --> 00:06:29,690
When you were practicing karate,

242
00:06:29,691 --> 00:06:31,010
like how long did you practice for?

243
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,030
I was like,

244
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:32,900
maybe like two years.

245
00:06:32,901 --> 00:06:34,520
And I gave it up because of the USC.

246
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,870
I gave it up because of the UFC.

247
00:06:35,871 --> 00:06:36,051
Yeah,

248
00:06:36,051 --> 00:06:38,180
we missed the boat when
Machida came along,

249
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,460
then all of a sudden people
started practicing karate again.

250
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:41,323
Well,

251
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:42,020
yeah,

252
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:42,590
it's true.

253
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:42,951
It's true.

254
00:06:42,951 --> 00:06:43,784
I love the chair.

255
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,200
Absolutely.

256
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:45,790
As long as you,

257
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:46,623
as long as it's,

258
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:51,050
as long as you're mixing it into a system
rather than sticking with coke Oshan

259
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:51,861
karate,

260
00:06:51,861 --> 00:06:52,694
which is what I had.

261
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:53,251
Um,

262
00:06:53,251 --> 00:06:56,510
and so my school was very
purist and when I said,

263
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,740
when did my sensai and said,

264
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:58,311
hey,

265
00:06:58,311 --> 00:06:58,641
you know,

266
00:06:58,641 --> 00:06:59,250
since a,

267
00:06:59,250 --> 00:06:59,760
uh,

268
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,890
in a very careful,

269
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:01,270
you know,

270
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:01,700
there's this,

271
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,500
there's authority in these dough Joe's,

272
00:07:03,501 --> 00:07:06,080
there's tradition that you
question at your peril.

273
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:06,840
Um,

274
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,611
and so I went in and said,

275
00:07:07,611 --> 00:07:07,761
yeah,

276
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:07,971
you know,

277
00:07:07,971 --> 00:07:08,541
since they bill,

278
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:08,960
you know,

279
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,710
uh,

280
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:10,780
I've been watching these tapes.

281
00:07:10,781 --> 00:07:14,210
So washing my blockbuster blockbuster
tapes of these UFC fights.

282
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,570
And long story short is guys like us.

283
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:19,040
They're not just losing,

284
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:20,510
they're getting slaughtered,

285
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:21,650
they're getting massacred.

286
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:21,981
You know,

287
00:07:21,981 --> 00:07:23,450
they get a couple of feeble punches off.

288
00:07:23,451 --> 00:07:24,470
They get tackled to the ground,

289
00:07:24,471 --> 00:07:25,520
beaten half to death.

290
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:27,021
And so I say to him,

291
00:07:27,021 --> 00:07:27,210
you know,

292
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:28,043
what do we do?

293
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:30,050
What do you do if you're
taking down in a fight?

294
00:07:30,051 --> 00:07:30,884
And He'd be like,

295
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,270
you look at me and be,

296
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:33,201
it's obvious.

297
00:07:33,201 --> 00:07:33,470
Just,

298
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:34,670
just don't get taken down.

299
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,060
It's that easy.

300
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:36,750
Oh.

301
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,460
And,

302
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:37,741
and I,

303
00:07:37,741 --> 00:07:40,100
and right then it hit me that he
didn't know anything about fighting.

304
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:43,550
He didn't know how often
fights go to the ground.

305
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:47,360
He didn't know that not getting
taken down is a martial art.

306
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:48,381
Yes.

307
00:07:48,381 --> 00:07:49,040
You know,

308
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,880
and he didn't know that.

309
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:50,270
If you don't,

310
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,260
if you're not training for that,

311
00:07:51,261 --> 00:07:52,810
if you're not drilling it,

312
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,020
you're going to get taken down.

313
00:07:54,021 --> 00:07:55,850
And if you haven't drilled
ways to stand back up again,

314
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,260
you're going to stay down.

315
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:57,680
Yeah.

316
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,110
So what I realized then that that was,

317
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:00,651
we were,

318
00:08:00,651 --> 00:08:00,981
we were,

319
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:01,814
we were,

320
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,880
we were like larpers
live action role playing,

321
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:05,660
you know what I mean?

322
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:05,840
No.

323
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,040
Larping is no,

324
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:11,900
but I do now it's live d and d you go
off into the woods with your friends and

325
00:08:11,901 --> 00:08:13,370
you play d and d live.

326
00:08:13,371 --> 00:08:13,481
Yeah,

327
00:08:13,481 --> 00:08:14,120
it's pretty awesome.

328
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:14,661
It's awful.

329
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:15,351
But that's what we were doing.

330
00:08:15,351 --> 00:08:15,831
Basically.

331
00:08:15,831 --> 00:08:16,790
We are larping as,

332
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:17,211
as you know,

333
00:08:17,211 --> 00:08:18,044
Samurai.

334
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,100
Um,

335
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:19,731
and uh,

336
00:08:19,731 --> 00:08:21,630
so after that was pretty
disillusioned and I,

337
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,513
and I gave it up.

338
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,110
I would've gone into it earlier,

339
00:08:24,111 --> 00:08:29,111
but it took a long time for MMA and
Bjj to make it to my neck of the woods.

340
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:32,480
It's been out here in La and in
New York City for a long time,

341
00:08:32,481 --> 00:08:35,330
but I've always kind of lived in
podunk towns and it's only in,

342
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:35,781
it's only,

343
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:36,140
again,

344
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:41,140
not until 2010 or 2011 that I had
the option to do this where I really,

345
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:42,110
so you know,

346
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:43,940
Jujitsu until 2010 or 11.

347
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:44,740
What is this?

348
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,640
You're still the same place
outside of Pittsburgh?

349
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,370
Yeah.

350
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:48,260
How far is Pittsburgh?

351
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:50,360
Pittsburgh is about a half hour,

352
00:08:50,361 --> 00:08:51,590
but even Pittsburgh,

353
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:54,700
Pittsburgh had one BJJ school it,

354
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:56,100
but that was all,

355
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:56,550
you know,

356
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:57,060
there wasn't,

357
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:57,481
there wasn't,

358
00:08:57,481 --> 00:08:57,840
there wasn't.

359
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,270
There was a fight club that had gone out
of business and him may club that had

360
00:09:00,271 --> 00:09:01,104
gone out of business.

361
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,210
They get their back now
and it ends up grace.

362
00:09:03,211 --> 00:09:04,140
He has a school there now.

363
00:09:04,141 --> 00:09:05,370
So there is good stuff there now,

364
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:09,210
but it's very difficult to make
money teaching MMA very difficult.

365
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,350
You can do much better teaching
Jujitsu or teaching taekwondo.

366
00:09:13,351 --> 00:09:14,280
Even our karate.

367
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,233
I think that's right.

368
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:15,480
Yeah.

369
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,230
I had a similar um,

370
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:18,600
martial arts upbringing.

371
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:19,350
Yeah.

372
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:23,070
I started out in taekwondo but
dedicated my entire life to it.

373
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,500
And then when I started kickboxing,

374
00:09:25,501 --> 00:09:26,610
that was my eye opening.

375
00:09:26,611 --> 00:09:28,440
It was before even grappling,

376
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,630
grappling them as my second eye opening.

377
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:34,740
My first eye opening was kickboxing
because I realize and then also just

378
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:38,190
training straight boxing rules that help
terrible my hands were cause taekwondo

379
00:09:38,191 --> 00:09:39,870
was so kicked the trivia.

380
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:40,410
Yeah.

381
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:42,300
It was just all about kicking.

382
00:09:42,301 --> 00:09:43,950
And when guys are only kicking you,

383
00:09:43,951 --> 00:09:46,320
there's a lot of things you can get away
with that you can't get away with when

384
00:09:46,321 --> 00:09:47,154
they're punching you.

385
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,980
And I had this like big
enlightenment moment like,

386
00:09:49,981 --> 00:09:50,281
man,

387
00:09:50,281 --> 00:09:52,860
I've been wasting my time and not really,

388
00:09:52,861 --> 00:09:56,440
it turned down in the long run cause
I learned a lot of things and I,

389
00:09:56,441 --> 00:09:59,430
I developed dexterity
that it's very unusual.

390
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:00,270
It's deck.

391
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:00,511
Yeah.

392
00:10:00,511 --> 00:10:01,051
Flexibility.

393
00:10:01,051 --> 00:10:04,230
But anybody could develop flexibility
is the dexterity is unusual.

394
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:08,220
Like the ability to throw
kicks in positions in ways
that a lot of other people

395
00:10:08,221 --> 00:10:08,940
can't.

396
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,440
And it's just because that's all you do.

397
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:11,610
You're throwing a lot of kicks.

398
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,000
Yeah.

399
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,220
And so there's a lot of
guys that took that style.

400
00:10:14,221 --> 00:10:17,970
Like Anderson Silva is one of them and
started out as a taekwondo guy and then

401
00:10:17,971 --> 00:10:20,220
eventually developed all
the martial arts skills.

402
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:24,240
Take down defense wrestling
and Jujitsu and whatnot.

403
00:10:24,241 --> 00:10:25,170
But yeah,

404
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,700
when the UFC came around,

405
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,100
most people who are on the outside,

406
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:29,940
they,

407
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:30,900
they'll look at it like,

408
00:10:30,901 --> 00:10:30,991
I've,

409
00:10:30,991 --> 00:10:32,520
I've had so many people say like,

410
00:10:32,521 --> 00:10:33,810
that's not martial arts,

411
00:10:33,811 --> 00:10:37,800
it's a sports martial sport and there's
all this silliness attached to it.

412
00:10:37,801 --> 00:10:42,030
But what they need to know is
that no one knew when I was a kid.

413
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:44,910
No one knew until 93 no one knew.

414
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,150
They didn't know that it was
so easy to take you down.

415
00:10:48,151 --> 00:10:49,190
And when they did take you down,

416
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,190
he would just break your arm.

417
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:53,400
Like they're just strangle you and sat
and it's like no one had any idea how

418
00:10:53,401 --> 00:10:54,190
vulnerable they were.

419
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:55,240
I know it's,

420
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:56,050
it was a shock,

421
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:56,490
right?

422
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:57,241
Wasn't it in shock.

423
00:10:57,241 --> 00:10:57,931
Total shock.

424
00:10:57,931 --> 00:10:58,590
And I watch,

425
00:10:58,590 --> 00:10:58,861
I mean,

426
00:10:58,861 --> 00:11:02,550
I remember seeing the first couple of
them and I watched them religiously.

427
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,101
At first I'd,

428
00:11:03,101 --> 00:11:03,331
I'd,

429
00:11:03,331 --> 00:11:03,991
I'd pause,

430
00:11:03,991 --> 00:11:04,681
I'd slowed down,

431
00:11:04,681 --> 00:11:06,040
I rewind and watch the movie.

432
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:06,874
We tried to etch it,

433
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:07,320
you know,

434
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,550
into my memory banks.

435
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:09,130
But I,

436
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:09,510
but I,

437
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:09,920
but I,

438
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,550
I watched with a sinking feeling like,

439
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,413
oh my God,

440
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:13,920
this is not at all.

441
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:15,683
Not at all.

442
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:19,950
I started you Jitsu almost
immediately after discovering it.

443
00:11:19,951 --> 00:11:23,790
I found out about it in 94
or five I think I found it.

444
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:27,600
It started out in 93 and I think I
came out to La in [inaudible] 94 and

445
00:11:27,601 --> 00:11:32,280
somewhere in mid 94 I've found out about
the UFC and I didn't see the first one.

446
00:11:32,281 --> 00:11:35,220
I saw like the second one
and I watched it on video.

447
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:35,910
That's what I did too.

448
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:36,060
Yeah,

449
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,970
like a VHS tape video.

450
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:38,401
Exactly.

451
00:11:38,401 --> 00:11:38,551
Yeah.

452
00:11:38,551 --> 00:11:40,230
I used to hang out in that
section of video store.

453
00:11:40,231 --> 00:11:41,064
I still remember it.

454
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:41,791
I would learn it.

455
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:42,561
They're dangerous.

456
00:11:42,561 --> 00:11:46,340
He like like little to large lobby lurking
there like like you know when you're

457
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:49,290
in the porno section or
something because it was like,

458
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,720
it was like UFC video with WWF,

459
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,220
a death faces.

460
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:54,160
Death

461
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,030
was in that section.

462
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,440
There were all lumped in together.

463
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:57,280
That's what it was with.

464
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,113
Yeah.

465
00:11:58,210 --> 00:11:58,451
Yeah.

466
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:01,090
I remember I was training
at the jet center,

467
00:12:01,091 --> 00:12:03,460
which is a famous
kickboxing gym and Van Eyes.

468
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:07,030
It was right before it went under
because they'd gotten damaged in the

469
00:12:07,031 --> 00:12:07,631
earthquake.

470
00:12:07,631 --> 00:12:10,480
And then once a rain came
after the earthquake,

471
00:12:10,481 --> 00:12:13,030
they got massive flood damage
and they eventually went under.

472
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,500
But before they went under,

473
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:16,420
that was where when I
first moved to California,

474
00:12:16,421 --> 00:12:20,560
I started working out and Benny the jet
or key does is like one of the pioneers

475
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:25,920
of not just kickboxing but incorporating
low kicks and fighting against the ties

476
00:12:26,381 --> 00:12:30,430
and the Japanese with their low kicks and
then fighting in like sort of no holds

477
00:12:30,431 --> 00:12:30,761
barred.

478
00:12:30,761 --> 00:12:31,750
Tournament's back then.

479
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:34,140
And Benny had this,

480
00:12:34,141 --> 00:12:34,420
uh,

481
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:34,601
you know,

482
00:12:34,601 --> 00:12:34,910
in his,

483
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:35,200
his,

484
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:35,620
uh,

485
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,020
his brother in law,

486
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:41,260
I guess blinky Rodriguez is a famous
kickboxers well would teach classes there.

487
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:46,260
And who's a crazy environment cause
he a blinky had some family tragedy

488
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,580
involving gang violence.

489
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:52,990
So he had a lot of gang members that
would a train there and work out there.

490
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:53,911
So like,

491
00:12:53,911 --> 00:12:54,820
like you'd have these guys,

492
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:58,300
like I remember this one guy had this
really shitty like prison tattoo on his

493
00:12:58,301 --> 00:13:01,480
back that said like whatever
gang member was like,

494
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:02,350
love block does.

495
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,660
And then underneath it
it said fuck the rest,

496
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:06,550
like tattooed big on his back,

497
00:13:06,551 --> 00:13:09,520
like a 12 year old drew it
in there and I was like,

498
00:13:09,521 --> 00:13:10,271
oh Christ.

499
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,320
Like this is where I'm working out.

500
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:12,370
And um,

501
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:13,161
you know,

502
00:13:13,161 --> 00:13:14,010
when we take classes,

503
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,550
those guys and spar with those guys,

504
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,050
it was just very disconcerting.

505
00:13:17,051 --> 00:13:19,690
Like you didn't want to beat up a gang
member and they get shot in the parking

506
00:13:19,691 --> 00:13:20,250
lot,

507
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,520
but the um,

508
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:21,860
the,

509
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:25,000
the place was abuzz about these tapes.

510
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,730
Like people had found out about him.

511
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:27,161
Everybody's like,

512
00:13:27,161 --> 00:13:27,994
you see this shit,

513
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:28,751
but it's like damn,

514
00:13:28,751 --> 00:13:30,700
this motherfucker just grabs
people and drag them to the ground,

515
00:13:30,701 --> 00:13:32,870
chokes him and everybody wanted
to talk about it and it was just,

516
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,120
it was just no sense.

517
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:34,810
It didn't,

518
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:35,820
not only didn't make any sense,

519
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,341
everybody was like,

520
00:13:36,341 --> 00:13:37,174
what are we doing here?

521
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:37,440
What do,

522
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:37,600
what do,

523
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,550
what do we doing with our skillset?

524
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:39,911
Like,

525
00:13:39,911 --> 00:13:40,870
cause this shit going to work.

526
00:13:40,871 --> 00:13:42,520
Like what if we want to
do one of those dudes?

527
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:45,130
And so I went to a cross and Gracie's,

528
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:47,620
which was a [inaudible] know about it.

529
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:49,750
I found out about the gym from,

530
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:50,890
there was a show called,

531
00:13:50,891 --> 00:13:53,740
I think it was called extreme
fighting championships.

532
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,130
There was a very small
at John Perretti was the,

533
00:13:57,131 --> 00:14:01,480
the the matchmaker and he was producing
it think it's called extreme combat

534
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,600
stream something stream.

535
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:06,200
I don't remember a lot of extreme uh,

536
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,053
promotions.

537
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:07,540
Yeah.

538
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,291
But they had a,

539
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:09,700
a montage,

540
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:13,470
like a training montage thing
for one of the fighters and uh,

541
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:18,490
he was training at Carlson Gracie's and
I knew that Mario Sperry train there and

542
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:18,761
he was like,

543
00:14:18,761 --> 00:14:22,720
one of the big guys at the
time and Marillo Bustamonte
was Dan Vitor Belfort was

544
00:14:22,721 --> 00:14:24,850
there before he made his UFC debut.

545
00:14:24,851 --> 00:14:27,580
I came in there right when
he was making his debut.

546
00:14:27,581 --> 00:14:28,414
He had just,

547
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:33,660
I got there when he was about to fight
John Hess in Hawaii and he fought Ho John

548
00:14:34,151 --> 00:14:37,810
has in Hawaii who had fought in the UFC
and beat the fuck out of them in about

549
00:14:37,811 --> 00:14:38,680
10 seconds.

550
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:40,600
It was like one of the
craziest fights ever.

551
00:14:40,601 --> 00:14:42,370
He got on top of them and just,

552
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:46,270
I think he went and needed a belly on
him and just uncorked about 50 punches to

553
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:46,721
his face.

554
00:14:46,721 --> 00:14:50,290
Like nobody had seen anybody like
Vittorio was a horrible monster.

555
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,980
He's still fighting fucking weekend,

556
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,060
which is so crazy.

557
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,790
Vito is fighting this
weekend for the title.

558
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:56,450
Yeah.

559
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:57,290
Madness.

560
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,513
But um,

561
00:14:58,990 --> 00:14:59,620
so that's,

562
00:14:59,620 --> 00:14:59,830
I,

563
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:01,080
I just was in the,

564
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:06,370
is immediately upon going to Carlson
Gracie's I was just manhandled and thrown

565
00:15:07,551 --> 00:15:10,660
around like a little baby
and strangled left and right.

566
00:15:10,661 --> 00:15:10,951
I was like,

567
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:11,571
Jesus Christ,

568
00:15:11,571 --> 00:15:12,650
I'm fucking helpless.

569
00:15:12,651 --> 00:15:14,960
I had this delusional idea that I could,

570
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,070
I could defend myself,

571
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,930
but as a white belt in Jujitsu,

572
00:15:17,931 --> 00:15:19,610
even with a year of high school wrestling,

573
00:15:19,611 --> 00:15:21,470
I kinda like knew how to wrestle a little.

574
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:25,730
I knew how to like get on top of guy
and then I get triangled their farm,

575
00:15:25,731 --> 00:15:29,040
barter guillotined and they'd
take my back and you know,

576
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,740
I didn't know what the
fuck to do with the gay,

577
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,090
the gay was ridiculous,

578
00:15:32,091 --> 00:15:32,720
crazy,

579
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,610
wrapping me up in that thing and just,

580
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,210
ugh.

581
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:37,040
It was so humiliating.

582
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:37,770
Yeah.

583
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:38,870
I'll never forget it,

584
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:42,200
but also so enlightening.

585
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:47,950
And for you going from this karate
background to then entering into mixed

586
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,480
martial arts training,

587
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:52,730
like what was,

588
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,560
why I'd never been punched
in the face for one thing.

589
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:56,000
It all your karate training.

590
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,070
No one punched you in the face.

591
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,580
We always threw punches to the
chest because it's Kyokushin.

592
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,493
Kio Yeah.

593
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:03,140
Yeah.

594
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:03,501
Wow.

595
00:16:03,501 --> 00:16:04,161
So you never,

596
00:16:04,161 --> 00:16:04,430
you never,

597
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,470
I mean that's boxing gloves
on and fucked around.

598
00:16:06,471 --> 00:16:07,190
Maybe we did,

599
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:08,030
but not for real.

600
00:16:08,031 --> 00:16:08,864
I mean the level,

601
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:09,041
the,

602
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:09,500
the,

603
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:13,220
the intensity of sparring at the
[inaudible] was so much more intense.

604
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,260
So maybe we put boxing gloves on and,

605
00:16:15,261 --> 00:16:15,541
and,

606
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:16,520
and threw some punches,

607
00:16:16,521 --> 00:16:17,750
but very soft.

608
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:18,580
Wow.

609
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:19,460
And there was,

610
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:22,640
there's days that the MMA
gym where it's a very,

611
00:16:22,641 --> 00:16:23,600
very close to being,

612
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:24,590
you know,

613
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:25,610
a real fight in there,

614
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,790
not fin is a real fun.

615
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,190
I was pretty close to
being in a real fight.

616
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:28,551
Yeah.

617
00:16:28,551 --> 00:16:29,061
It's painful.

618
00:16:29,061 --> 00:16:29,830
Ask as in,

619
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:30,380
um,

620
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,040
and um,

621
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,230
the Daniel Cormier who is
also fighting this weekend,

622
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:34,480
um,

623
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,271
Courtney said,

624
00:16:35,271 --> 00:16:37,790
sometimes mean Keynes bar
and sometimes we fight.

625
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:39,600
Fuck.

626
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,660
He said that in the old days we fought,

627
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:42,853
we always fought.

628
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:43,880
Now sometimes he's bar.

629
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:46,963
Well that's,

630
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:48,470
that's a big concern today.

631
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:52,550
The big concern is like how much do you
take out of yourself in the gym is how

632
00:16:52,551 --> 00:16:52,970
much,

633
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,520
how much is it necessary though?

634
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:58,790
Like in order to prepare to be comfortable
in the cage and to fight at your

635
00:16:58,791 --> 00:16:59,390
best,

636
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:01,100
how much do you have to
take out of your system?

637
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:01,580
Man,

638
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,940
it is a tough decision because
if they go the go easy,

639
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:05,980
they're afraid that their guys go,

640
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:07,220
I'm really horrible at the time.

641
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,300
I think go hard.

642
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:08,770
There's a,

643
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:09,090
yeah,

644
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:09,451
what does it,

645
00:17:09,451 --> 00:17:10,550
it's practically a coin flip,

646
00:17:10,551 --> 00:17:13,580
but they're going to get through to the
fight without getting injured in some

647
00:17:13,581 --> 00:17:14,150
way.

648
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:14,983
Well,

649
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:16,280
one of the best gyms,

650
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:17,150
um,

651
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:18,620
American Kickboxing Academy,

652
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:19,610
uh,

653
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:20,271
Dana White,

654
00:17:20,271 --> 00:17:22,190
it was just talking about how they train,

655
00:17:22,191 --> 00:17:22,880
like cavemen,

656
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,240
like to get,

657
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,110
get out of stone age.

658
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,840
And they kind of said,

659
00:17:26,841 --> 00:17:27,111
look,

660
00:17:27,111 --> 00:17:27,351
you know,

661
00:17:27,351 --> 00:17:30,500
you kind of don't realize what's
necessary to prepare for fights,

662
00:17:30,501 --> 00:17:33,410
but then you look at the amount
of guys that get hurt there.

663
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:33,950
Yeah,

664
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:35,120
it is pretty crazy.

665
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:35,840
Yeah,

666
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,940
but you look at the amount of
guys that have really good there.

667
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,080
Luke Rockhold,

668
00:17:39,081 --> 00:17:39,641
Daniel core,

669
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:42,020
me a Cain Velasquez like fuck.

670
00:17:42,021 --> 00:17:43,430
You can't argue with that success.

671
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,760
And it seems to me like there
is no easy way out of this.

672
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:47,721
Does no,

673
00:17:47,721 --> 00:17:49,380
I don't think you can train light.

674
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,400
The problem

675
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,220
is like,

676
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:51,570
uh,

677
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,500
other sports would have this
problems that they have.

678
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:58,580
They have an authority that governs it
and makes everyone behave the same way.

679
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,330
So the NFL,

680
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:00,841
for instance,

681
00:18:00,841 --> 00:18:01,561
for the NCAA,

682
00:18:01,561 --> 00:18:02,790
like football teams for instance,

683
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:05,400
there are allowed to practice so
many hours a week and that's it.

684
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:06,410
Really?

685
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:07,243
Yeah.

686
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,071
It's by a rule,

687
00:18:08,071 --> 00:18:08,251
you know,

688
00:18:08,251 --> 00:18:09,084
you're not allowed that you put,

689
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:11,580
you put you in your 20 or 30
hours a week and then that's it.

690
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:13,590
You're not allowed to train on your own.

691
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:14,121
Why?

692
00:18:14,121 --> 00:18:14,954
Because he could.

693
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:15,511
That's the problem.

694
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:16,500
You guys will cheat and go.

695
00:18:16,501 --> 00:18:16,900
Yeah.

696
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,130
Well that's a problem with fighting.

697
00:18:18,131 --> 00:18:19,570
Fighting is a team sport.

698
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,020
No,

699
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:20,651
no findings.

700
00:18:20,651 --> 00:18:23,710
An individual's right to
anytime anybody goes well,

701
00:18:23,711 --> 00:18:24,610
the people in the NFL,

702
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:25,570
people,

703
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:26,403
the NFL,

704
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:29,710
first of all that fucking whistle
blows and you get a nice juicy break.

705
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:30,140
Yeah,

706
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,450
I mean now you get to catch your breath,

707
00:18:31,451 --> 00:18:34,350
walk around offsides you
got that guy talks timeout.

708
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:39,480
He says a bunch of shit that went wrong
and everybody complains and it's a joke.

709
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:43,180
If you compare the amount of effort
you have to put forth and an NFL,

710
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:45,370
sure the collisions are horrific.

711
00:18:45,371 --> 00:18:46,021
Shore you.

712
00:18:46,021 --> 00:18:48,580
You mean you got to work out hard
to be that fucking big and strong.

713
00:18:48,581 --> 00:18:49,480
There's no doubt about it.

714
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:54,750
But as for like the life and death
experience of being in the cage,

715
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:57,430
fuck

716
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:57,710
man.

717
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:57,880
No,

718
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,181
I don't think,

719
00:18:58,181 --> 00:18:59,470
I think comparison is nothing.

720
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:00,723
There's nothing.

721
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:02,840
Now how did you,

722
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,750
did you start off with
the beginner classes?

723
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,860
Like how did you,

724
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,150
how did you enter into this?

725
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,291
No,

726
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:10,120
I mean basically this gym,

727
00:19:10,121 --> 00:19:10,954
it's a small gym,

728
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:11,261
you know,

729
00:19:11,261 --> 00:19:12,400
it's a small town.

730
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:13,000
How many,

731
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:13,700
how many students were,

732
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,440
ah,

733
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,220
it would vary,

734
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:15,491
you know,

735
00:19:15,491 --> 00:19:15,641
like,

736
00:19:15,641 --> 00:19:16,221
it's like you said,

737
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:19,060
and it is a tough business and
MMA gym with a tough business.

738
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:22,060
And so it might be booming in
popularity as a spectator sport.

739
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:25,570
It doesn't mean most guys want to
get in there and start training.

740
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:25,901
Right.

741
00:19:25,901 --> 00:19:26,730
I mean,

742
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:30,370
cause it doesn't look like all that much
fun opening up a base jumping school.

743
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,240
Yeah,

744
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:31,721
pretty much.

745
00:19:31,721 --> 00:19:31,890
Yeah.

746
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:32,710
Yeah.

747
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:32,951
Um,

748
00:19:32,951 --> 00:19:33,700
so,

749
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,120
uh,

750
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:37,140
I think he expected as a lot of
guys who opened those gyms to that,

751
00:19:37,141 --> 00:19:39,850
that the level of popularity
as a spectator sport,

752
00:19:39,851 --> 00:19:43,330
it would track with the level
of a participate participation.

753
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:44,500
Um,

754
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,540
so maybe like most nights
to be 15 guys there,

755
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:47,523
something like that.

756
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:48,640
Too Bad.

757
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,181
That's not too bad.

758
00:19:49,181 --> 00:19:49,610
Yeah.

759
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:53,660
Did you ever have an issue with the guys
who were more experienced beating up on

760
00:19:53,661 --> 00:19:54,260
the guys who so

761
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:54,980
weren't,

762
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:55,520
I mean,

763
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,060
honestly,

764
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:56,631
sometimes,

765
00:19:56,631 --> 00:19:57,231
but honestly,

766
00:19:57,231 --> 00:19:58,064
not for the most part.

767
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:58,550
Uh,

768
00:19:58,550 --> 00:19:58,941
you know,

769
00:19:58,941 --> 00:20:02,990
there's a very clear pecking order
emerges in an intimate jam or any kind of

770
00:20:02,991 --> 00:20:05,810
martial arts gym almost from day one.

771
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,120
And people have a very good sense of very,

772
00:20:08,121 --> 00:20:12,050
very good sense of who would kick his
ass if it came down to a real fight.

773
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:12,710
Um,

774
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:13,730
and so for the most part,

775
00:20:13,731 --> 00:20:16,520
the big guys don't bully
or oppress the little guys.

776
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,600
It was no glory in it.

777
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:22,160
And the little guys also know
not to antagonize the big guys,

778
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:22,881
you know,

779
00:20:22,881 --> 00:20:24,170
they give them respect,

780
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:27,170
they give them submissive body language.

781
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:27,591
You know,

782
00:20:27,591 --> 00:20:28,520
one time I was going to fight,

783
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:28,910
uh,

784
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:32,330
or spar this big heavyweight in my
channel and we often had this part of our

785
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:33,980
weight class because it is a smaller gym.

786
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:35,870
So this guy weighs like 270 pounds.

787
00:20:35,871 --> 00:20:37,940
He's a competition fight or I'm terrified.

788
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:38,571
Um,

789
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:40,100
and in the moment before the bell rings,

790
00:20:40,101 --> 00:20:41,620
I go right up to him and I hug him,

791
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,170
bury my head right in his fragrant,

792
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,460
meaty cleavage.

793
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,213
And I say,

794
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,270
come on Clark,

795
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:50,230
I got a family.

796
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,160
You know,

797
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:53,220
I'm after that,

798
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:53,950
you know,

799
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:55,270
you didn't exactly go easy on me,

800
00:20:55,271 --> 00:20:56,170
but he let me live.

801
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:58,870
So and that happens,

802
00:20:58,900 --> 00:20:59,171
you know,

803
00:20:59,171 --> 00:21:00,340
I was pretty explicit about it,

804
00:21:00,341 --> 00:21:01,660
but I think that kind of language,

805
00:21:01,661 --> 00:21:03,850
that kind of communication
is going on a lot at the gym.

806
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:04,973
Yeah,

807
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,300
it certainly is.

808
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,040
It does in Jujitsu as well.

809
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:10,170
Like you'll see some guys
that like as the rolling,

810
00:21:10,171 --> 00:21:12,540
they're just more
submissive to other guys.

811
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,500
You know,

812
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,300
like when someone is more dominant,

813
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:16,210
it's like you,

814
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,090
there's just certain
things you don't even try.

815
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,000
Like you'll automatically
go in defensive mode,

816
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:25,200
which is also very dangerous for the guy
who's the best guy in the gym because

817
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:29,430
you can get a very inflated sense
of your abilities if you're always,

818
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:34,200
it's like there's certain finders that
fought in lower level organizations and

819
00:21:34,201 --> 00:21:37,230
then came over to the UFC and
as they came over to the UFC,

820
00:21:37,231 --> 00:21:40,650
one of the first things that was clear
was that they had never faced another

821
00:21:40,651 --> 00:21:41,150
killer.

822
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:41,430
Yeah.

823
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:42,980
Like they might be a killer themselves.

824
00:21:42,981 --> 00:21:43,410
Yeah.

825
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:47,010
But they had never faced another killer
and then wouldn't face a killer in the

826
00:21:47,011 --> 00:21:47,491
UFC.

827
00:21:47,491 --> 00:21:47,850
They'd be like,

828
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:48,421
oh,

829
00:21:48,421 --> 00:21:50,490
this is what it's like
to fight me this song.

830
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:51,890
And you,

831
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:55,920
you would often find out who's
got it and who doesn't have it.

832
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:56,230
Sure.

833
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:56,771
I might tell him.

834
00:21:56,771 --> 00:21:57,700
That's definitely true.

835
00:21:57,910 --> 00:21:58,091
Yeah.

836
00:21:58,091 --> 00:21:59,530
They call them the better guys there.

837
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:01,270
I don't hit those guys harder than face.

838
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:01,751
No Way.

839
00:22:01,751 --> 00:22:02,081
Yeah.

840
00:22:02,081 --> 00:22:02,770
You don't want to,

841
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:03,410
no way.

842
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:04,930
Even you authorize them to hit you hard.

843
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:06,171
Yeah.

844
00:22:06,171 --> 00:22:06,620
We'll see.

845
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:09,290
I'll be Carlos Condit said
that once he did this,

846
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:10,124
um,

847
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:10,371
uh,

848
00:22:10,371 --> 00:22:11,300
this thing,

849
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:11,631
uh,

850
00:22:11,631 --> 00:22:15,320
for the military and did
this some sparring and stuff
with some of the military

851
00:22:15,321 --> 00:22:16,670
guys and he's real clear.

852
00:22:16,671 --> 00:22:16,881
He goes,

853
00:22:16,881 --> 00:22:17,540
hey man,

854
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:18,080
he goes,

855
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,190
we can have some fun here.

856
00:22:19,191 --> 00:22:21,140
Just hit me as hard as
you want to get hit.

857
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:21,983
Exactly.

858
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:23,930
When you're that good.

859
00:22:23,931 --> 00:22:24,381
And you could say,

860
00:22:24,381 --> 00:22:25,940
just hit me as hard as you want to get it.

861
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,710
Don't hit that guy hard.

862
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:28,573
Trust me.

863
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,153
But that's,

864
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:31,881
you know,

865
00:22:31,881 --> 00:22:32,180
it's,

866
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:34,580
it's finding that perfect balance of,

867
00:22:34,581 --> 00:22:35,840
of competition,

868
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,520
but have also,

869
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:38,170
you know,

870
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:42,500
like you got to figure out how to
not kill each other inside the gym.

871
00:22:42,501 --> 00:22:44,750
You gotta compete and push each other.

872
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:49,840
And oftentimes it's just a matter of just
pulling back on shots of not trying to

873
00:22:49,971 --> 00:22:53,270
knock each other out because the guys
who tried to knock each other out,

874
00:22:53,271 --> 00:22:53,540
man,

875
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,380
that fucking,

876
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:57,740
that style of sparring that just cannot,

877
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,090
cannot maintain.

878
00:22:59,710 --> 00:22:59,921
No,

879
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:00,900
I think it's really dominant.

880
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:04,600
There are guys in my gym like that guys
who apparently can't pull the punch

881
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:07,480
either by either by lack of athleticism.

882
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:08,471
You know what I mean?

883
00:23:08,471 --> 00:23:11,230
It's kind of a hard thing to throw the
punch as hard as you can do there are for

884
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,240
that and then pull it
at the very last second.

885
00:23:13,241 --> 00:23:16,560
That's kind of an athletic thing
to be able to pull off and,

886
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:19,120
and I would hate hate is
partnering with those guys.

887
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:19,561
Yeah,

888
00:23:19,561 --> 00:23:20,910
there's always a guy like that.

889
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:24,690
There's guys like that in Jujitsu
to that guys would never spar with.

890
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:25,711
There was this one,

891
00:23:25,711 --> 00:23:26,460
dude,

892
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:27,780
no need to name names,

893
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,310
but at a John Jacques Machado is,

894
00:23:29,311 --> 00:23:32,160
we'd all just get away from this
guy because if you sparred with him,

895
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:33,240
if he caught you in anything,

896
00:23:33,241 --> 00:23:35,460
he's going to fuck your
arm up fucking neck up.

897
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,990
Like he just would not let go and he
didn't know how to not yank on things.

898
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,920
And then there's other guys that were way
better than him that you never worried

899
00:23:43,921 --> 00:23:44,221
about.

900
00:23:44,221 --> 00:23:45,054
Like you might get,

901
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,440
you might get tapped like,

902
00:23:46,441 --> 00:23:46,850
yeah,

903
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:48,590
like if you roll with
John Jacques Machado,

904
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,210
even if you get tapped,

905
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,650
it's so controlled.

906
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:51,861
Right?

907
00:23:51,861 --> 00:23:52,940
Like you never get hurt,

908
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:53,630
you know,

909
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:56,660
like he'll be wraps you up in a triangle
or takes your back or something like

910
00:23:56,661 --> 00:23:57,021
that.

911
00:23:57,021 --> 00:24:00,160
Like he's in control the entire time.

912
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:04,190
There's no yanking or weird shit
twisting that you didn't expect.

913
00:24:04,191 --> 00:24:05,930
And those are like the dangerous guys,

914
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,520
like the really strong blue belts.

915
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:08,220
Yeah,

916
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:08,820
that's true.

917
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:09,300
That's true.

918
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:09,460
Yeah.

919
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:10,930
Those are the guys that much them to,

920
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:12,660
or there was guys who were like,

921
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:15,690
there's guys that can't quite spar
than then you have to fight them.

922
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:16,411
You know what?

923
00:24:16,411 --> 00:24:16,950
I mean,

924
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:17,790
you're going to come so hard.

925
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:18,840
You almost have to fight them.

926
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:20,240
And that I don't,

927
00:24:20,241 --> 00:24:21,074
I don't want to do,

928
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:21,940
are you still doing it?

929
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:22,803
Are you still,

930
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:23,800
after you wrote the book?

931
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:24,470
I did it,

932
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:24,620
you know,

933
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:28,040
this was a big thing that this was the
big surprise for me about doing this

934
00:24:28,041 --> 00:24:29,270
whole project was,

935
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:29,601
again,

936
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:30,980
I wa I look at it from across the street.

937
00:24:30,981 --> 00:24:31,910
I'd always been a fan,

938
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,710
but I never really wanted to do it myself.

939
00:24:33,711 --> 00:24:35,420
I wanted to do Jujitsu,

940
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,550
but I didn't really want
to be a cage fighter.

941
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:38,480
Um,

942
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,680
it didn't look like fun to me.

943
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:41,570
It looked like about
as much fun as torture.

944
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:42,350
You know what I mean?

945
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:43,820
It looks scary and painful.

946
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:44,840
Uh,

947
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,390
and the biggest shock for
me was that I loved it.

948
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:48,823
I loved it.

949
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:49,360
Um,

950
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,430
so I expected to do it for a year
and then to quit the absolute second.

951
00:24:52,431 --> 00:24:53,360
My fight was over.

952
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:54,623
Um,

953
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:55,400
you know,

954
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:55,761
that's it.

955
00:24:55,761 --> 00:24:56,594
I'm retired.

956
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,590
I'll go write the book.

957
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:58,190
Uh,

958
00:24:58,190 --> 00:24:58,881
but I,

959
00:24:58,881 --> 00:24:59,450
uh,

960
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:01,670
I kept doing it for a
couple of years longer,

961
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:02,690
um,

962
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:03,440
because I really loved it.

963
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,400
I loved the Camaraderie.

964
00:25:04,401 --> 00:25:05,390
I love the challenge of it.

965
00:25:05,391 --> 00:25:06,500
Love the way it made me feel.

966
00:25:06,501 --> 00:25:07,334
I love the way,

967
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:08,000
you know,

968
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,560
gave me this ability to live
a sort of head long life,

969
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:13,071
you know,

970
00:25:13,071 --> 00:25:14,360
for a couple hours a week is all.

971
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:15,410
What do you mean by headlong?

972
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:15,741
I don't know.

973
00:25:15,741 --> 00:25:17,060
I had this restraint in my life.

974
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:17,500
I'm a,

975
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,260
I'm a,

976
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,130
I'm a professor,

977
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:20,020
you know,

978
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:23,270
I had this really a dull
life and a lot of ways.

979
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:25,160
And then just for a few hours a week,

980
00:25:25,161 --> 00:25:27,710
I go in and I take these
risks and then Jim and I,

981
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,680
and I experienced these
big emotions and these big,

982
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:31,700
these big highs,

983
00:25:31,701 --> 00:25:32,510
you know?

984
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:36,830
And then about a year ago I was so beat
up that I really just couldn't continue

985
00:25:36,831 --> 00:25:37,610
anymore.

986
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:39,590
And giving up was one of the
hardest things I've ever done.

987
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,161
Uh,

988
00:25:40,161 --> 00:25:40,700
it was like,

989
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,270
you know,

990
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:46,220
I kind of felt like this romance in my
life had come to an end and I was too

991
00:25:46,221 --> 00:25:47,600
brittle and too old,

992
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:47,961
you know,

993
00:25:47,961 --> 00:25:48,920
to recapture it.

994
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:51,530
What was the issue like physically?

995
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:54,200
I always expected for it to end badly.

996
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:54,501
You know,

997
00:25:54,501 --> 00:25:56,320
I knew it was kind of pushed
my luck and I figured that,

998
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:58,150
I figured I'd go out on
my shield at some point.

999
00:25:58,151 --> 00:26:00,830
You'll go out on a stretcher after some
horrible head injury or blow out my knee

1000
00:26:00,831 --> 00:26:01,664
or something like that.

1001
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,020
It wasn't like that though.

1002
00:26:03,021 --> 00:26:03,854
It was more like a,

1003
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:06,680
a an accumulation of little things,

1004
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,720
a rickety old man stuff,

1005
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:09,260
you know,

1006
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:11,810
you just get older and you start picking
up these little injuries and they don't

1007
00:26:11,811 --> 00:26:12,644
go away.

1008
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:12,870
Uh,

1009
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:13,340
so I got,

1010
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:13,830
you know,

1011
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:18,830
I kept getting turf toe from kicks and
from getting stuck on the mat and that

1012
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:21,020
turned into arthritis at some point.

1013
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:25,310
And I've pulled my groin bad and that's
been bad and then mess up my neck one

1014
00:26:25,311 --> 00:26:25,791
time.

1015
00:26:25,791 --> 00:26:26,630
And uh,

1016
00:26:26,631 --> 00:26:27,860
it was never been quite the same,

1017
00:26:27,861 --> 00:26:28,071
just,

1018
00:26:28,071 --> 00:26:28,730
just,

1019
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:32,720
just got rickety and a pardon reason I
had started going to hot yoga as we said

1020
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:33,823
before,

1021
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:37,460
is in hopes of carrying all this stuff,

1022
00:26:37,461 --> 00:26:37,731
you know,

1023
00:26:37,731 --> 00:26:39,050
getting any physically health,

1024
00:26:39,051 --> 00:26:42,110
getting my flexibility better
so I can't get back in the gym.

1025
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:44,040
I don't ever want to do hardcore and

1026
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:44,890
the main sparring anymore.

1027
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:46,050
I want to get hit in the head anymore.

1028
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:46,650
Uh,

1029
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:48,840
but I do want to get back into
the grappling elements of it.

1030
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:49,561
Yeah.

1031
00:26:49,561 --> 00:26:52,590
We were talking about it before the
podcast started that I've become addicted

1032
00:26:52,591 --> 00:26:53,760
the last few weeks to yoga.

1033
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:54,061
Yeah,

1034
00:26:54,061 --> 00:26:54,720
me too.

1035
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,111
Yeah.

1036
00:26:55,111 --> 00:26:55,944
It just kept,

1037
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:56,340
I,

1038
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,960
I've got this reoccurring,

1039
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:58,740
um,

1040
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,010
uh,

1041
00:26:59,010 --> 00:26:59,760
issue.

1042
00:26:59,760 --> 00:26:59,940
Well,

1043
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:00,211
I have,

1044
00:27:00,211 --> 00:27:01,980
I have a pulled muscle in my,

1045
00:27:01,981 --> 00:27:04,350
but very uncomfortable to talk about it.

1046
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:05,310
Um,

1047
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,001
but it's,

1048
00:27:06,001 --> 00:27:06,360
uh,

1049
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:06,751
it's,

1050
00:27:06,751 --> 00:27:07,051
it's,

1051
00:27:07,051 --> 00:27:10,190
it's aggravated when I throw kicks and
so I wasn't throwing kicks for awhile,

1052
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,080
but there's certain punches
when I'd just push off of it.

1053
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,180
It just is something about exploding.

1054
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:15,841
So I was like,

1055
00:27:15,841 --> 00:27:16,250
man,

1056
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:18,420
I gotta stretch out my
back so he's fucked up.

1057
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:21,570
And so I started taking a hot yoga like a,

1058
00:27:21,571 --> 00:27:22,920
about a week and a half ago.

1059
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:23,731
And,

1060
00:27:23,731 --> 00:27:23,900
uh,

1061
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:27,150
like almost immediately I found
out that it calmed me down.

1062
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:28,030
Like almost immediately.

1063
00:27:28,031 --> 00:27:32,790
It was like my stress level
just dropped tremendously.

1064
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:33,061
I mean,

1065
00:27:33,061 --> 00:27:33,930
I had done it before,

1066
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:36,030
but I've been real inconsistent about it.

1067
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:39,720
So I'm trying to do four
days a week for like a year.

1068
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:40,350
That's my,

1069
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:41,183
that's my goal too.

1070
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:41,750
I'm like,

1071
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:43,110
well can you do it on back to back days?

1072
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:43,531
Yeah.

1073
00:27:43,531 --> 00:27:46,590
You can often feel so tired
from it on the second day.

1074
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:47,640
Muscularly tired.

1075
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:47,941
I mean,

1076
00:27:47,941 --> 00:27:50,220
the thing that I didn't expect
about Yoga is how difficult it is.

1077
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:50,730
Yeah.

1078
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:51,480
I mean I knew it was like,

1079
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:51,840
I thought you were,

1080
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,830
I thought it was be in a hot room.

1081
00:27:52,831 --> 00:27:53,460
Stretching.

1082
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,293
That's what I thought it was.

1083
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:55,163
I know what I mean.

1084
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:56,220
But it is,

1085
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,770
I mean the level of exertion
is really extraordinary.

1086
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:02,070
It's harder than a lot of Jujitsu
classes and people are going to say,

1087
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:03,090
get the fuck out of here.

1088
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:03,660
It's,

1089
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:08,660
if I have to roll with five blue belts
that are my size or do a class in hot

1090
00:28:09,061 --> 00:28:09,421
yoga,

1091
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:11,580
I guarantee you it's harder to do yoga.

1092
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:12,000
Yeah.

1093
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,830
Cause if a guy's under my level,

1094
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:15,810
I can pretty much control what happens.

1095
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:16,171
You know?

1096
00:28:16,171 --> 00:28:16,501
I could,

1097
00:28:16,501 --> 00:28:17,970
I could hold positions,

1098
00:28:17,971 --> 00:28:20,840
I could choose to take
breaks and you know,

1099
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,660
I can mount them and just relax,

1100
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:23,270
you know?

1101
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:23,590
Yeah.

1102
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:24,110
He's like,

1103
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:24,750
you can't,

1104
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:25,583
he can't do that.

1105
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:27,120
If you're fighting for your life.

1106
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:27,600
No,

1107
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,080
you can get someone good if you're
grappling with someone really good.

1108
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:33,510
Jujitsu is harder because
it's fighting to the death.

1109
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:34,261
You know,

1110
00:28:34,261 --> 00:28:38,700
if there's someone who's
just just a little bit better
than you or a solid notch

1111
00:28:38,701 --> 00:28:40,500
better than you and they're
trying to kill you and you're,

1112
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:42,070
you're constantly on the,

1113
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,790
they're not good enough that
you're in total defensive mode,

1114
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:45,770
you're still,

1115
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:45,920
oh,

1116
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,200
that's,

1117
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:46,920
you're still in the game.

1118
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,170
Gets a heart attack
stages where you're like,

1119
00:28:49,171 --> 00:28:50,760
this might end right here.

1120
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:53,910
This whole fucking life on this
planet might end right here for me.

1121
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:54,541
It would be a good look.

1122
00:28:54,541 --> 00:28:55,530
That'd be a good death for you.

1123
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:56,700
It's not the worst death.

1124
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:57,540
Um,

1125
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:00,930
but yoga is almost as difficult.

1126
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,010
It's really hard.

1127
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:02,730
I mean,

1128
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:04,020
I was going to write something about it,

1129
00:29:04,021 --> 00:29:08,880
like I might ride it still like a blog
entry about how there's this life or

1130
00:29:08,881 --> 00:29:10,340
death struggle that's going on,

1131
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:15,090
these hot rooms all over the country
and no one knows how difficult it really

1132
00:29:15,091 --> 00:29:15,451
is.

1133
00:29:15,451 --> 00:29:18,390
Everybody thinks it's like really easy
because a bunch of women are doing it.

1134
00:29:18,391 --> 00:29:19,170
Exactly.

1135
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:19,561
Exactly.

1136
00:29:19,561 --> 00:29:21,690
I think guys don't get it at all
cause I'm always there and it's,

1137
00:29:21,691 --> 00:29:22,491
and I kind of like the,

1138
00:29:22,491 --> 00:29:23,910
the female environment of it.

1139
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:24,391
Yeah.

1140
00:29:24,391 --> 00:29:24,871
I like that.

1141
00:29:24,871 --> 00:29:27,000
It's such a big transition from the gym,

1142
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:27,661
you know,

1143
00:29:27,661 --> 00:29:30,600
where like it's
noncompetitive in the hole.

1144
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,950
Even if it was a male teacher,

1145
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:34,020
the whole culture is still female,

1146
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:34,530
you know?

1147
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:34,891
It's like,

1148
00:29:34,891 --> 00:29:35,410
uh,

1149
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:36,490
it's a feminine culture.

1150
00:29:36,491 --> 00:29:39,260
It's like it's none of the
macho stuff is going right.

1151
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,240
Right.

1152
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:40,501
You're not,

1153
00:29:40,501 --> 00:29:44,380
you're not trying to vanquish the room
at hot yoga like you will be possibly if

1154
00:29:44,381 --> 00:29:45,071
you were at the gym,

1155
00:29:45,071 --> 00:29:45,740
you know?

1156
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:46,390
Um,

1157
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:46,820
so I'm,

1158
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:49,420
I just dig it and I think it's a main
thing that people don't get about it

1159
00:29:49,421 --> 00:29:51,940
because I would've thought I
would've had the same stereotypes.

1160
00:29:51,941 --> 00:29:52,691
I think a lot of people have.

1161
00:29:52,691 --> 00:29:54,130
That's kind of a sissy thing to do.

1162
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,260
There's nothing sissy about it.

1163
00:29:55,261 --> 00:29:55,601
It's really,

1164
00:29:55,601 --> 00:29:55,961
it's really,

1165
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:56,200
uh,

1166
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,100
it's really a hard thing.

1167
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:57,701
Yeah.

1168
00:29:57,701 --> 00:29:59,890
It just has a weird connotation.

1169
00:29:59,891 --> 00:30:00,551
For some reason.

1170
00:30:00,551 --> 00:30:01,570
It was a weird,

1171
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,900
we have this weird perception of
it because we see girls and tights.

1172
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,330
How could they be working?

1173
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:07,821
Exactly.

1174
00:30:07,821 --> 00:30:08,590
It's ridiculous.

1175
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:09,311
I want you to check.

1176
00:30:09,311 --> 00:30:10,144
I wonder if they're not,

1177
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:13,690
I wonder if I do get the feeling
that I am working harder because,

1178
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,650
because I'm newer and I have to work
really hard to get into these positions

1179
00:30:17,651 --> 00:30:19,420
because I'm not sure I'm
not my flexibility socks.

1180
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,591
And when he thinks women,

1181
00:30:20,591 --> 00:30:23,710
a lot of them are super flexible and
they seem to get into those positions

1182
00:30:23,711 --> 00:30:28,711
pretty effortlessly and hold them with
less vibration than I'm holding them.

1183
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:29,340
You know what mean?

1184
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,580
Some for sure,

1185
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,631
but some,

1186
00:30:31,631 --> 00:30:33,240
I mean there's this one lady that uh,

1187
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,290
I go to this class and she's,

1188
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,310
she's got to take a break.

1189
00:30:36,311 --> 00:30:37,150
Like every other post,

1190
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:38,350
she's barely getting through it.

1191
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:43,390
She's very out of shape and
she's attempting to do this
very difficult class and

1192
00:30:43,391 --> 00:30:46,150
there's certain certain things
when I do it where I'm like,

1193
00:30:46,151 --> 00:30:46,780
fucking,

1194
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:50,410
I could barely hang in here
until this guy calls it.

1195
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:50,590
No,

1196
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:50,950
me too.

1197
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:54,730
But in other ones it's a breeze where
other people were really struggling.

1198
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:56,170
It depends on the instructor you mean?

1199
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:56,511
No,

1200
00:30:56,511 --> 00:30:56,720
no,

1201
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,280
no.

1202
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,290
The flexibility.

1203
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:58,991
I like,

1204
00:30:58,991 --> 00:31:01,030
I have a lot of flexibility in my legs,

1205
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:05,410
like kicking flexibility and so there's
certain poses where everybody else is

1206
00:31:05,411 --> 00:31:06,820
struggling and I'm taking a break.

1207
00:31:06,821 --> 00:31:07,070
I'm like,

1208
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:07,491
whew,

1209
00:31:07,491 --> 00:31:08,410
I can relax here.

1210
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,160
Arms back.

1211
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:09,790
Yeah,

1212
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:10,840
that can do all that.

1213
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:13,750
But the big one is like
stretching my legs out,

1214
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,220
putting my body forward,

1215
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:17,080
or with a lot of people
they're holding it,

1216
00:31:17,081 --> 00:31:17,480
holding it.

1217
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:17,740
I'm like,

1218
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:18,670
I can go to sleep here.

1219
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:19,990
So it's nice.

1220
00:31:19,991 --> 00:31:21,310
I get little breaks now for me,

1221
00:31:21,311 --> 00:31:21,671
I'm fighting,

1222
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:22,940
I'm fighting for my life in that position.

1223
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:25,180
And having that voice in my head is is,

1224
00:31:25,181 --> 00:31:25,361
you know,

1225
00:31:25,361 --> 00:31:26,930
like you can do it pause.

1226
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,780
But then there's other ones
where I'm just fucking dying.

1227
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,380
You know?

1228
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:32,641
It's,

1229
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:33,910
it's really difficult.

1230
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:34,833
But you know,

1231
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,320
again,

1232
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:39,040
I think there's a balance issue and
I think when you're all the time,

1233
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,410
all the explosion lifting weights,

1234
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,030
kettlebells,

1235
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:43,863
yeah,

1236
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:44,740
yeah.

1237
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:49,210
I think it's good to do like
static tension relieving,

1238
00:31:49,211 --> 00:31:51,400
long holding those poses,

1239
00:31:51,401 --> 00:31:52,120
stretching,

1240
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,830
elongating the muscle,

1241
00:31:53,831 --> 00:31:55,450
stretching out all the tissue,

1242
00:31:55,451 --> 00:31:58,600
stretching out the hamstrings
and the back muscles.

1243
00:31:58,601 --> 00:31:59,434
And there's so much,

1244
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,180
so much stretching going on.

1245
00:32:01,181 --> 00:32:02,410
I realize when I'm doing it,

1246
00:32:02,411 --> 00:32:02,681
I'm like,

1247
00:32:02,681 --> 00:32:03,041
this is,

1248
00:32:03,041 --> 00:32:04,120
I don't ever do this.

1249
00:32:04,121 --> 00:32:04,780
I said,

1250
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:07,030
I never lengthen everything out.

1251
00:32:07,031 --> 00:32:08,770
Everything is just getting compressed.

1252
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:09,873
Everything is,

1253
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:16,270
everything is explosion and all this
fucking heavyweight and there's a,

1254
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,500
I think you need balance.

1255
00:32:17,501 --> 00:32:18,071
I don't think it's,

1256
00:32:18,071 --> 00:32:19,360
you should have only yoga.

1257
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:20,223
Like I think it's,

1258
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:23,770
I think it's good to put weight on your
body and your muscles because it's good

1259
00:32:23,771 --> 00:32:24,630
for your density,

1260
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:25,210
your bones.

1261
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:26,320
It maintains mass.

1262
00:32:26,321 --> 00:32:26,770
It,

1263
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:28,850
it keeps you from getting frail as,

1264
00:32:28,851 --> 00:32:29,950
especially as you get older.

1265
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:35,230
But I think stretching and yoga positions
should be almost mandatory for people

1266
00:32:35,231 --> 00:32:36,400
to get their shit together.

1267
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:36,881
You know?

1268
00:32:36,881 --> 00:32:37,061
It's,

1269
00:32:37,061 --> 00:32:37,301
it's,

1270
00:32:37,301 --> 00:32:38,710
it makes you way calmer.

1271
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:40,043
I don't know why.

1272
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:45,350
I mean I wish w I w I wonder if it's just
physical tension being released or if

1273
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:47,900
just stretching itself,

1274
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:52,070
if there's something in the act of
doing so that just when it's over,

1275
00:32:52,071 --> 00:32:54,920
everything else just seems
like calm and relaxed.

1276
00:32:54,921 --> 00:32:57,530
Like the difficulty of those poses.

1277
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:58,733
Yeah.

1278
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:01,670
I always felt like it was just,

1279
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:03,950
it burns through so much energy.

1280
00:33:03,951 --> 00:33:07,250
You don't have anything less to tor left
to torture yourself with afterwards.

1281
00:33:07,251 --> 00:33:07,521
You know,

1282
00:33:07,521 --> 00:33:07,711
the,

1283
00:33:07,711 --> 00:33:10,570
the anxiety's kind of burned through
and now I had the same sense.

1284
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,433
You did it the first time I did.

1285
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:11,661
I was like,

1286
00:33:11,661 --> 00:33:12,111
oh my God,

1287
00:33:12,111 --> 00:33:14,090
this is the healthiest thing
I've ever done in my life.

1288
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,200
How long you've been doing it?

1289
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,670
Like I've done like 10 classes,

1290
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:18,470
so I'm still at that stage of like,

1291
00:33:18,471 --> 00:33:18,830
you know,

1292
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,260
converts people,

1293
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:20,840
you know.

1294
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:21,490
Oh yeah.

1295
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:22,640
I'm a blue belt disease.

1296
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:26,720
Like just before you get a blue belt
Jujitsu guys just to want to talk about

1297
00:33:26,721 --> 00:33:27,920
anything but Jujitsu.

1298
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:32,720
So you want to do it to a point where
you get healthy enough to go back to

1299
00:33:32,721 --> 00:33:33,500
grappling.

1300
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:33,711
Yeah.

1301
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:34,520
I'd like to get back into it.

1302
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:34,910
The Gym.

1303
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:35,030
Yeah.

1304
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:35,361
I miss,

1305
00:33:35,361 --> 00:33:36,081
I miss the guys.

1306
00:33:36,081 --> 00:33:36,660
I miss.

1307
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:37,640
It was a good thing for me.

1308
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,271
You know?

1309
00:33:38,271 --> 00:33:38,481
Uh,

1310
00:33:38,481 --> 00:33:40,330
Anthony Bordain just cut into Jujitsu.

1311
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:41,151
Do you know what I did that,

1312
00:33:41,151 --> 00:33:41,331
yeah,

1313
00:33:41,331 --> 00:33:41,811
I didn't know that.

1314
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:42,180
Yeah.

1315
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:42,400
Yeah.

1316
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,233
It's amazing.

1317
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:43,970
Yeah,

1318
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:45,000
I know he loves it too.

1319
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:46,191
I met him,

1320
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:47,060
that fucking guy,

1321
00:33:47,061 --> 00:33:47,960
blue belt disease.

1322
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:49,940
He's still smoked a few cigarettes.

1323
00:33:49,941 --> 00:33:50,361
When I met him,

1324
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:51,141
drank crazy.

1325
00:33:51,141 --> 00:33:52,610
Lee has he quit drinking a lot?

1326
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:52,971
Yeah,

1327
00:33:52,971 --> 00:33:53,780
he quit smoking.

1328
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:55,430
He quit smoking when he had his daughter.

1329
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,433
Um,

1330
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,450
which was just right.

1331
00:33:58,460 --> 00:33:58,671
Right.

1332
00:33:58,671 --> 00:34:01,360
Cause right around when
I was meeting him and um,

1333
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:05,150
was just eating whatever the
fuck you wanted to getting,

1334
00:34:05,151 --> 00:34:05,481
you know,

1335
00:34:05,481 --> 00:34:09,830
a belly and drinking all the time
and traveling around the world.

1336
00:34:09,831 --> 00:34:11,960
And then his wife is a maniac.

1337
00:34:11,961 --> 00:34:13,490
His wife is a Jujitsu fiend,

1338
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:16,340
but I see a guy like that
and I'm like at 58 years old.

1339
00:34:16,341 --> 00:34:17,081
Like how,

1340
00:34:17,081 --> 00:34:19,940
how much can his body [inaudible]
he's doing it like twice a day.

1341
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:24,290
I wonder if he's doing any yoga
or anything to counteract just,

1342
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:25,340
I dunno,

1343
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:27,140
just age related degeneration.

1344
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,100
I don't know.

1345
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,120
I often wonder that about,

1346
00:34:29,121 --> 00:34:29,330
about,

1347
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:30,050
about that myself,

1348
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:33,830
I wonder if like the fact that he wasn't
athletic for most of his life means

1349
00:34:33,831 --> 00:34:34,370
that he hit,

1350
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:36,410
he hadn't put a lot of
hard miles on himself.

1351
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:37,483
That could be true.

1352
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:37,790
My,

1353
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:39,540
now you've got a lot of
hard miles on yourself.

1354
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,580
I got quite a few hard miles.

1355
00:34:40,581 --> 00:34:41,150
I'm less now,

1356
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:41,983
you know?

1357
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:42,381
Yeah.

1358
00:34:42,381 --> 00:34:45,860
I have a lot of fucking
hard miles on this body.

1359
00:34:45,861 --> 00:34:47,240
It's a lot of surgeries,

1360
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:50,870
a lot of injuries and
but works amazingly well.

1361
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,600
But a lot of that is because I
don't have a conventional job.

1362
00:34:53,601 --> 00:34:55,250
I was thinking that today
when I did that class,

1363
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:56,241
I was like,

1364
00:34:56,241 --> 00:34:58,010
how many fucking people
have an hour and a half,

1365
00:34:58,490 --> 00:34:59,120
you know,

1366
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:03,500
the middle of the day or at nine o'clock
in the morning to go in there and you

1367
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:03,890
know,

1368
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:06,170
stretch out in the fucking sweat
box for an hour and a half.

1369
00:35:06,171 --> 00:35:07,820
Most people just don't have that time.

1370
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:10,340
And then when you get home you have,

1371
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:10,700
you know,

1372
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:15,110
your family and bills and blah blah blah
blah blah blah blah and you have all

1373
00:35:15,111 --> 00:35:15,920
this shit to deal with.

1374
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:20,920
Most people don't have the time to to put
in for body maintenance for the proper

1375
00:35:20,961 --> 00:35:21,794
body maintenance.

1376
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,633
It's very true.

1377
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:24,890
It comes down to the conversation
with a friend about nutrition.

1378
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,110
Like they were asking
me like what kind of,

1379
00:35:27,111 --> 00:35:28,880
which kind of supplement should I get,

1380
00:35:28,881 --> 00:35:29,714
what should I do?

1381
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,261
And I said,

1382
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:30,411
well,

1383
00:35:30,411 --> 00:35:33,260
one of the first thing you should do
is find a qualified doctor and get your

1384
00:35:33,261 --> 00:35:33,981
blood work done.

1385
00:35:33,981 --> 00:35:35,990
Find out where your
nutrition levels are at,

1386
00:35:35,991 --> 00:35:37,140
what your vitamin levels are.

1387
00:35:37,141 --> 00:35:37,351
Like,

1388
00:35:37,351 --> 00:35:37,981
let's find out,

1389
00:35:37,981 --> 00:35:39,720
like eat what you normally eat.

1390
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:40,111
Don't get,

1391
00:35:40,111 --> 00:35:42,480
you don't have to get
crazy and try to fix it,

1392
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,980
but eat what you normally eat.

1393
00:35:43,981 --> 00:35:45,090
And then let's find out what,

1394
00:35:45,091 --> 00:35:46,020
what do you need?

1395
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:46,830
You know,

1396
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:47,541
most people like,

1397
00:35:47,541 --> 00:35:47,850
oh,

1398
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:48,690
that's how much time.

1399
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:49,101
Yeah.

1400
00:35:49,101 --> 00:35:51,900
Then all the energy and time for
a doctor and do the research.

1401
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,160
It's a lot of work.

1402
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:53,730
It's,

1403
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:55,770
it's jobs or bullshit.

1404
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:56,940
That's the real problem.

1405
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:57,983
They're bullshit.

1406
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:58,351
I mean,

1407
00:35:58,351 --> 00:36:03,000
part of what you were feeling when you
saw those guys across the street and

1408
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:04,710
there were there were living their life.

1409
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:06,540
You realize that you were contained.

1410
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,553
Yeah.

1411
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,760
A box and the professor in the cage,

1412
00:36:09,761 --> 00:36:10,750
the cage is the cage.

1413
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:11,613
It's fighting cage,

1414
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:13,420
but it's also my office.

1415
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:13,631
You know,

1416
00:36:13,631 --> 00:36:13,820
my,

1417
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:14,061
my,

1418
00:36:14,061 --> 00:36:15,460
my cubicle where I worked.

1419
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:17,950
And so the book is about
getting out of that cubicle.

1420
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:18,400
You know,

1421
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:18,790
I was,

1422
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:19,061
you know,

1423
00:36:19,061 --> 00:36:19,480
getting,

1424
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,400
getting out of my academic career

1425
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:23,310
if this thing sold like crazy,

1426
00:36:23,311 --> 00:36:26,310
would you be willing to
write their professor in the
Mat and enter into Jujitsu?

1427
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,111
Yeah,

1428
00:36:28,111 --> 00:36:28,531
for sure.

1429
00:36:28,531 --> 00:36:29,250
Man.

1430
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:30,540
Professor in the Yoga Room.

1431
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:31,440
Yeah,

1432
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,041
absolutely.

1433
00:36:32,041 --> 00:36:32,990
Adventures as a,

1434
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:33,420
uh,

1435
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:33,900
want,

1436
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,700
want to be Yogi start a franchise.

1437
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,553
Yeah,

1438
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:37,763
definitely.

1439
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:38,551
Now,

1440
00:36:38,551 --> 00:36:39,030
um,

1441
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,400
what is boring about teaching English?

1442
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:42,320
It wasn't,

1443
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,153
it was boring.

1444
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:43,950
I don't know.

1445
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:44,150
You know,

1446
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:45,840
I was teaching a lot of writing classes,

1447
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:46,430
uh,

1448
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:50,160
especially freshmen writing and freshmen
writing and my college was mandatory.

1449
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:50,800
Uh,

1450
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:55,080
which means that everyone
there is a captive and most
college courses you get to

1451
00:36:55,081 --> 00:36:57,210
take whatever you want to
take cause there's electives,

1452
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,680
you're not forced to be anywhere.

1453
00:36:58,681 --> 00:37:00,120
This is a class you're forced to be.

1454
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:04,140
And so I was teaching freshman composition
over and over and over again to

1455
00:37:04,141 --> 00:37:05,310
students who just didn't,

1456
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:06,241
couldn't care less,

1457
00:37:06,241 --> 00:37:07,074
you know.

1458
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:07,410
Um,

1459
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:08,580
and so that was lame.

1460
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:10,920
Or the main problem though
was that I was an adjunct.

1461
00:37:10,921 --> 00:37:11,491
You don't an adjunct.

1462
00:37:11,491 --> 00:37:15,030
Is that just like if not a
full time faculty member?

1463
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:15,571
Um,

1464
00:37:15,571 --> 00:37:15,961
so,

1465
00:37:15,961 --> 00:37:16,171
you know,

1466
00:37:16,171 --> 00:37:16,470
for,

1467
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:16,821
for,

1468
00:37:16,821 --> 00:37:17,490
for like,

1469
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:18,241
almost 10 years,

1470
00:37:18,241 --> 00:37:19,860
I'm making about 16 grand a year,

1471
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:20,570
you know,

1472
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:20,910
uh,

1473
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:21,191
making,

1474
00:37:21,191 --> 00:37:21,261
uh,

1475
00:37:21,261 --> 00:37:21,491
you know,

1476
00:37:21,491 --> 00:37:22,324
just kind of,

1477
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,020
kind of chasing this dream of being a,

1478
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,160
a boyhood dream,

1479
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:27,330
really of being a college professor,

1480
00:37:27,331 --> 00:37:28,440
of being a scholar.

1481
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,060
I wanted to be that guy,

1482
00:37:30,061 --> 00:37:35,061
like the guy who makes some small but
meaningful contribution to knowledge.

1483
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,130
And I had been chasing that dream for a
long time and writing books and tune it,

1484
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:42,240
written the articles and
doing all kinds of stuff.

1485
00:37:42,241 --> 00:37:43,110
But it just wasn't,

1486
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:43,860
my,

1487
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:47,040
my research was a little bit
nonconventional and it just wasn't,

1488
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,000
I wasn't making it,

1489
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:49,020
you know what I mean?

1490
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:50,070
And so,

1491
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:50,670
uh,

1492
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:52,200
and I just didn't have
the courage to quit.

1493
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:53,161
It wasn't,

1494
00:37:53,161 --> 00:37:55,650
I don't know if it's a
courage thing or if it was a,

1495
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:56,543
uh,

1496
00:37:57,570 --> 00:37:58,400
a desire thing.

1497
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:58,631
I don't,

1498
00:37:58,631 --> 00:37:58,951
I don't like,

1499
00:37:58,951 --> 00:38:01,200
I don't like quitting on something
that I've invested in target.

1500
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:01,391
You know,

1501
00:38:01,391 --> 00:38:01,621
it's like,

1502
00:38:01,621 --> 00:38:02,610
it's like if you're gambling,

1503
00:38:02,611 --> 00:38:02,731
you know,

1504
00:38:02,731 --> 00:38:03,600
you throw money in the pot,

1505
00:38:03,601 --> 00:38:05,100
you don't want to fucking fold,

1506
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:05,761
even though,

1507
00:38:05,761 --> 00:38:06,031
you know,

1508
00:38:06,031 --> 00:38:06,864
you should fold.

1509
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,160
And so when I started,

1510
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:10,260
when I went across the
street that first time,

1511
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,180
and I made that joke at my own expense of,

1512
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:14,790
it wouldn't be funny if I went over there.

1513
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,600
Part of it,

1514
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,370
part of what was driving
me to cross over there,

1515
00:38:17,371 --> 00:38:19,290
it was a career suicide fantasy.

1516
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:20,670
I was thinking to myself,

1517
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:23,040
why you apparently don't have the
courage to quit your job and move on to

1518
00:38:23,041 --> 00:38:23,874
something else?

1519
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:27,640
Maybe you can do something offensive
enough to people in your profession that

1520
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:28,533
will get you fired.

1521
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:30,230
I'm like,

1522
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:32,010
so if I showed up in the cage,

1523
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:34,830
everybody in my department
will be able to honest to God,

1524
00:38:34,831 --> 00:38:36,400
like up from the poems they were reading,

1525
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,151
you know,

1526
00:38:37,151 --> 00:38:37,841
reading their poems,

1527
00:38:37,841 --> 00:38:40,900
they look up and they'd be able
to see me right across the street,

1528
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:41,710
you know,

1529
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:41,861
uh,

1530
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:45,640
engaged in bloodsport and they don't
really approve of a bloodsport and English

1531
00:38:45,641 --> 00:38:46,240
departments.

1532
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,940
What has the reaction
been amongst your peers?

1533
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:50,110
Um,

1534
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:50,560
okay.

1535
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,393
Career suicide,

1536
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:51,850
career,

1537
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:52,690
suicide fantasy.

1538
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:53,000
Right,

1539
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:53,350
right.

1540
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:54,640
So I went over there thinking,

1541
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:55,150
ah,

1542
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:56,950
I can't quit me back and get myself fired.

1543
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:58,060
Um,

1544
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:58,690
on my,

1545
00:38:58,690 --> 00:38:59,710
on my campus.

1546
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:00,430
Uh,

1547
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:04,330
people were much more tolerant
and open minded than I had hoped.

1548
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:06,581
They didn't get.

1549
00:39:06,581 --> 00:39:07,960
They didn't get furious with me.

1550
00:39:07,961 --> 00:39:08,380
They didn't,

1551
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:09,580
they didn't try to fire me.

1552
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:11,320
It's because they know me.

1553
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:13,210
They know I'm not a savage animal.

1554
00:39:13,211 --> 00:39:13,691
They know,

1555
00:39:13,691 --> 00:39:13,870
um,

1556
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:14,410
you know,

1557
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:15,790
the enormity decent human being.

1558
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:16,660
Um,

1559
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:16,961
the,

1560
00:39:16,961 --> 00:39:18,120
the bigger question is what,

1561
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:22,750
what effect will have within the larger
profession will be an effective career

1562
00:39:22,751 --> 00:39:23,920
suicide strategy.

1563
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:26,860
Once other people in the
profession get ahold of the book.

1564
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:30,040
And I do think probably
it'll be a success.

1565
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:31,540
That's a career suicide strategy.

1566
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:32,140
Uh,

1567
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:33,430
about two weeks after the book came out,

1568
00:39:33,431 --> 00:39:33,610
this,

1569
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:33,851
this,

1570
00:39:33,851 --> 00:39:34,031
uh,

1571
00:39:34,031 --> 00:39:35,830
article came out about
me and about the book,

1572
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:36,370
uh,

1573
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:40,390
in this magazine that no one reads in
the real world called the chronicle of

1574
00:39:40,391 --> 00:39:41,224
higher education,

1575
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:44,920
but it's the main trade
magazine for academia.

1576
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:50,400
And the book comes off pretty
much as a glorification of Macho,

1577
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:52,900
barbarism and their in their,

1578
00:39:52,901 --> 00:39:53,561
in their thinking,

1579
00:39:53,561 --> 00:39:53,741
you know,

1580
00:39:53,741 --> 00:39:54,850
what a dumb,

1581
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:58,480
a dumb glorification of
butchery and barbarism.

1582
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:00,430
He might mean butchery even.

1583
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:00,950
Well,

1584
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:03,090
you just using that word and Sam savagery,

1585
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:03,410
sat,

1586
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:04,220
savagery,

1587
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:04,960
barbarism.

1588
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,793
Um,

1589
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:07,170
it sounds like it was written by a pussy.

1590
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:09,743
So

1591
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:12,700
there's a lot of that.

1592
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:15,090
So that could be effective in
ending my career because that,

1593
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:15,940
that's a guy,

1594
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:17,680
like I read about that
and I read the article,

1595
00:40:17,681 --> 00:40:18,280
I was like,

1596
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,420
I was like I said to my wife like,

1597
00:40:19,421 --> 00:40:19,691
okay,

1598
00:40:19,691 --> 00:40:20,590
that ends up there.

1599
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,473
There it is.

1600
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:22,373
Yeah.

1601
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,253
Well written.

1602
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:23,851
Well read.

1603
00:40:23,851 --> 00:40:24,910
Did Guy have a points?

1604
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:25,960
No,

1605
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:26,793
I mean,

1606
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:27,041
no.

1607
00:40:27,041 --> 00:40:28,410
I mean it's all going to be well written.

1608
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,490
We didn't have points
cause he's a good writer,

1609
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:31,840
you know what I mean?

1610
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,520
But um,

1611
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:32,860
it's not,

1612
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,000
I don't think it's good journalism,

1613
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:35,283
but it's good writing.

1614
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:36,640
Well it's editorial.

1615
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,031
I mean,

1616
00:40:37,031 --> 00:40:38,800
I mean whenever you're yeah,

1617
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:39,210
it wasn't,

1618
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:39,551
it was a,

1619
00:40:39,551 --> 00:40:40,510
it was a feature,

1620
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:41,403
a sort of portrait.

1621
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:42,603
And instead of,

1622
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:44,050
instead of making an actual portrait,

1623
00:40:44,051 --> 00:40:45,070
he sort of drew a caricature,

1624
00:40:45,071 --> 00:40:45,850
in my opinion,

1625
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:48,520
a caricature of you or have
we and the book and the,

1626
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:53,210
of what you're trying to
accomplish or of the sport itself.

1627
00:40:53,211 --> 00:40:54,070
Let me give you one example.

1628
00:40:54,071 --> 00:40:54,904
So,

1629
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:55,571
one example,

1630
00:40:55,571 --> 00:40:56,740
he quotes in the book is like,

1631
00:40:56,741 --> 00:40:57,574
we're at lunch,

1632
00:40:58,180 --> 00:40:58,870
you know,

1633
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:00,130
and we're having a nice time.

1634
00:41:00,131 --> 00:41:00,320
And,

1635
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:00,820
and,

1636
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:05,820
and at some point I lean across the
table toward him and I say to him like,

1637
00:41:06,161 --> 00:41:06,371
this,

1638
00:41:06,371 --> 00:41:06,610
you know,

1639
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:08,440
across the table in an
intimidating fashion,

1640
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,150
what would it take?

1641
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:14,350
What would I have to say to get
you to punch me in the face?

1642
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:15,550
That would just said to him,

1643
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:15,821
really?

1644
00:41:15,821 --> 00:41:15,941
Yeah,

1645
00:41:15,941 --> 00:41:16,774
I said it to him,

1646
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:18,070
but if he's 80,

1647
00:41:18,071 --> 00:41:19,750
strip out all the damn context.

1648
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:20,140
Right?

1649
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:21,290
So in context that,

1650
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:21,471
you know,

1651
00:41:21,471 --> 00:41:24,850
that statement is about me saying how
hard it is to get guys punch you in the

1652
00:41:24,851 --> 00:41:27,100
face that men are fairly peaceable,

1653
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,080
minutemen avoid conflict.

1654
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:29,580
Um,

1655
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:31,600
they're very fairly prudent
about throwing their,

1656
00:41:31,601 --> 00:41:31,781
their,

1657
00:41:31,781 --> 00:41:32,620
their fists around.

1658
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:34,190
Most guys will go

1659
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:38,180
to great lengths to find a face saving
way out of a violent confrontation.

1660
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:39,800
So within context,

1661
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:40,050
the,

1662
00:41:40,050 --> 00:41:42,620
the statement was almost the
opposite of what it made.

1663
00:41:42,621 --> 00:41:44,270
It made it seem like,

1664
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:45,110
right.

1665
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:47,060
So in his words,

1666
00:41:47,061 --> 00:41:47,930
you were trying,

1667
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:50,150
you were intimidating him and pretty much,

1668
00:41:50,151 --> 00:41:50,870
yeah.

1669
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:52,910
Well maybe that's just how he took it.

1670
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:57,950
Some people are super uncomfortable with
any idea it like any form of conflict,

1671
00:41:58,370 --> 00:41:58,791
you know,

1672
00:41:58,791 --> 00:41:59,560
and they,

1673
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,940
they would like to categorize any,

1674
00:42:01,941 --> 00:42:03,860
any kind of violent interaction,

1675
00:42:03,861 --> 00:42:08,480
even voluntary violent interaction like
mixed martial arts competition as being

1676
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:09,411
barbaric,

1677
00:42:09,411 --> 00:42:11,840
as having no virtue as having no,

1678
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:12,350
no,

1679
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:13,610
there's no nobility.

1680
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,120
I,

1681
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:14,990
I get that too.

1682
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:15,151
And I,

1683
00:42:15,151 --> 00:42:16,010
I think,

1684
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:18,710
I don't know if it's harder for
you to get into that mind space,

1685
00:42:18,711 --> 00:42:20,810
but it's not hard for me to
get into that mind space,

1686
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:24,530
mind space of person who looks at
that and sees no redemption in it.

1687
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:25,910
Nothing good about it.

1688
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:27,190
I don't have a hard time.

1689
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:28,460
It's easy for me to get into.

1690
00:42:28,461 --> 00:42:29,970
It sounds crazy because I,

1691
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:30,830
I,

1692
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:32,000
it's my job.

1693
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:35,060
I mean I'm a mixed martial arts
commentator for the university,

1694
00:42:35,061 --> 00:42:37,250
but I have a problem with,

1695
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,140
I have a problem with the damage.

1696
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:39,920
I have a pro.

1697
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,570
I was living three existence.

1698
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:43,430
It's going to ask you about that.

1699
00:42:43,431 --> 00:42:43,760
Yeah.

1700
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,240
I mean,

1701
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,730
I love watching fights.

1702
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:49,040
I have always loved watching fights.

1703
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:51,590
I love that people,

1704
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:52,010
uh,

1705
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:56,510
have this burning desire in them to do
what I think is the most difficult sport

1706
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:57,613
in the world.

1707
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:59,270
I don't think there's anything even close.

1708
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:03,070
I think as far as the
emotions that are invested in,

1709
00:43:03,071 --> 00:43:03,730
in,

1710
00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:05,920
in trying to win and the debt,

1711
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:10,790
devastating effect of a loss and then
the actual physical damage that you take

1712
00:43:10,791 --> 00:43:15,140
along the way you or your vehicle
that you were racing is your own body.

1713
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:17,150
And unlike a race car,

1714
00:43:17,151 --> 00:43:20,960
your body will respond
only if you push it.

1715
00:43:20,961 --> 00:43:21,621
And Training,

1716
00:43:21,621 --> 00:43:24,050
you have to elevate its capacity.

1717
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:28,910
You have to elevate its tolerances and
you have to do that intelligently and it

1718
00:43:28,911 --> 00:43:31,730
has to be done in the
watchful eye of trainers.

1719
00:43:31,731 --> 00:43:32,331
And along the way,

1720
00:43:32,331 --> 00:43:35,330
there's all these variables you have
to take into account strength and

1721
00:43:35,331 --> 00:43:36,164
conditioning.

1722
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:39,410
What kind of a body type or
you're dealing with what you know,

1723
00:43:39,411 --> 00:43:40,730
what skill set do you have?

1724
00:43:40,731 --> 00:43:41,840
What needs to be improved?

1725
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:46,460
Objectivity objectively and analyzing
your strengths and weaknesses,

1726
00:43:46,461 --> 00:43:47,670
looking at your skill set,

1727
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:51,680
looking at the weapons that you have that
you need to keep sharp and looking at

1728
00:43:51,681 --> 00:43:53,180
ones that you need to acquire.

1729
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:54,980
There's so many variables.

1730
00:43:54,981 --> 00:43:58,130
To me it's the ultimate problem solving.

1731
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,560
High level competition.

1732
00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:02,120
I don't think there's anything like it,

1733
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:06,180
but I have a problem
with a lot of the ass.

1734
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:08,810
I'll have a lot of problem with
a lot of the thuggish behavior.

1735
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:10,840
I have a problem with a,

1736
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:13,520
I mean even though I know a lot of it
is psychological warfare and trying to

1737
00:44:13,521 --> 00:44:14,331
intimidate each other,

1738
00:44:14,331 --> 00:44:15,410
I have a problem with some of that.

1739
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:17,720
I have a problem with the
damage that guys tick.

1740
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:19,460
I've written a real problem with that.

1741
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:23,330
I have a real problem with
guys not knowing when to
get out with their friends,

1742
00:44:23,331 --> 00:44:23,931
telling them,

1743
00:44:23,931 --> 00:44:24,591
listen man,

1744
00:44:24,591 --> 00:44:26,120
she's got to put together one hard.

1745
00:44:26,121 --> 00:44:26,571
Can't be like,

1746
00:44:26,571 --> 00:44:27,110
no,

1747
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:27,471
no.

1748
00:44:27,471 --> 00:44:29,810
He's been knocked out seven fucking times.

1749
00:44:29,930 --> 00:44:30,231
Like No.

1750
00:44:30,231 --> 00:44:33,630
He needs to preserve his brain
for the rest of his life.

1751
00:44:33,810 --> 00:44:36,090
Have you ever met an old
man that used to fight?

1752
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,080
I have.

1753
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,010
It's not fun.

1754
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:39,510
It's not fun at all.

1755
00:44:39,530 --> 00:44:39,990
It's,

1756
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:43,870
it's very uncomfortable to talk to a guy
who tells the same fucking story over

1757
00:44:43,871 --> 00:44:46,950
and over and over and
over and over and over.

1758
00:44:47,590 --> 00:44:48,060
Yes.

1759
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:48,540
Yeah.

1760
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:49,373
Yes I do.

1761
00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:51,870
And I know UFC fighters who
didn't use to be like that,

1762
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:53,250
who are like that now.

1763
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:55,080
And there's some of my all time favorites.

1764
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:56,390
This is the big question for me.

1765
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:58,260
Let me ask one more question.

1766
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:00,720
The other day on the podcast,

1767
00:45:00,721 --> 00:45:04,770
you mentioned a Howard Cosell given up
that work after seeing a particularly

1768
00:45:04,771 --> 00:45:05,604
gruesome fight.

1769
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:06,541
Larry Holmes.

1770
00:45:06,541 --> 00:45:07,374
Tux Cob.

1771
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:08,190
Yeah.

1772
00:45:08,190 --> 00:45:08,611
You ever,

1773
00:45:08,611 --> 00:45:10,530
you ever think that could happen to you?

1774
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:11,903
Um,

1775
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,410
it's possible.

1776
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:14,060
Yeah.

1777
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:16,860
It's possible that there'll come
a day where I can't do it anymore,

1778
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:18,300
that I don't want to do it anymore.

1779
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:19,770
I'll probably always be a fan.

1780
00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:21,023
Um,

1781
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:21,580
uh,

1782
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:22,700
to some extent look,

1783
00:45:22,701 --> 00:45:23,970
but like my favorite guys,

1784
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:24,804
mighty mouse,

1785
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:25,320
you know,

1786
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:30,030
people think like my all time favorite
guys are some of the craziest,

1787
00:45:30,031 --> 00:45:32,220
like Vandelay Silva is one
of my all time favorite,

1788
00:45:32,221 --> 00:45:34,530
just cause his fights were fucking chaos.

1789
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:37,050
You knew if you're going to
watch a Vandelay Silva fight,

1790
00:45:37,290 --> 00:45:41,760
that dude across the ring and he's
wiggling his wrists back in the pride days

1791
00:45:41,761 --> 00:45:43,240
doing this shit and he wa he,

1792
00:45:43,290 --> 00:45:43,710
he,

1793
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:46,320
he was probably one of the
best middleweights ever.

1794
00:45:46,890 --> 00:45:47,280
Um,

1795
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:47,551
you know,

1796
00:45:47,551 --> 00:45:49,830
or light heavyweight in that
division is two oh three,

1797
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:50,641
but a,

1798
00:45:50,641 --> 00:45:51,600
they called it middle weight.

1799
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:52,350
They called,

1800
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:53,183
uh,

1801
00:45:53,370 --> 00:45:54,230
the actual called,

1802
00:45:54,570 --> 00:45:54,750
yeah,

1803
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:57,540
they called the one 85 pound
division was welterweight,

1804
00:45:57,900 --> 00:45:58,733
I think.

1805
00:45:58,830 --> 00:45:59,160
Um,

1806
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:03,900
but Vandelay who was just the
opposite of like mighty mouse,

1807
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:08,040
like mighty mouse is my favorite
currently because he fights so fucking

1808
00:46:08,041 --> 00:46:08,910
intelligently.

1809
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:09,930
Everything he does,

1810
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:11,040
his movement,

1811
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:12,900
his footwork is positioning.

1812
00:46:13,050 --> 00:46:15,810
He's always in condition
is conditioning is insane.

1813
00:46:15,811 --> 00:46:19,080
They could just push guys to the point
where they just cannot keep up with him

1814
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:20,131
and his,

1815
00:46:20,131 --> 00:46:24,480
just his technical superiority
over all of the competition.

1816
00:46:24,481 --> 00:46:25,500
It's just so obvious.

1817
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:27,150
And his work ethic,

1818
00:46:27,151 --> 00:46:28,050
his intelligence,

1819
00:46:28,230 --> 00:46:29,610
he's a great role model.

1820
00:46:29,611 --> 00:46:30,600
When you hear him talk,

1821
00:46:30,601 --> 00:46:32,430
he's a very intelligent young man,

1822
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:34,380
but also humble and friendly.

1823
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:35,423
I mean he did.

1824
00:46:35,470 --> 00:46:36,330
You see him,

1825
00:46:36,331 --> 00:46:38,450
the only thing that tells you that
guy's a martial arts fighters,

1826
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:39,293
his ears.

1827
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:40,080
You look at him,

1828
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:41,880
he seemed so friendly and so nice,

1829
00:46:41,881 --> 00:46:42,631
but then he gets in there,

1830
00:46:42,631 --> 00:46:44,160
he's the baddest
motherfucker on the world.

1831
00:46:44,161 --> 00:46:45,480
Pound for pound in my opinion.

1832
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:45,801
Yeah,

1833
00:46:45,801 --> 00:46:45,990
no,

1834
00:46:45,990 --> 00:46:47,860
I think he's just 125 pounds.

1835
00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:48,920
So you know,

1836
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,220
he doesn't get the
attention because of the,

1837
00:46:50,221 --> 00:46:50,910
no,

1838
00:46:50,910 --> 00:46:51,661
but you know,

1839
00:46:51,661 --> 00:46:54,150
other than that fade
or who's just violence,

1840
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:55,510
every one of his fights was Zvi,

1841
00:46:55,511 --> 00:46:59,640
but PR intelligence and Anderson who
was just a wizard and understanding his

1842
00:46:59,641 --> 00:47:01,680
prime was the wizard of all wizards.

1843
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:04,830
He would pull off things where you
just go get the fuck outta here.

1844
00:47:04,831 --> 00:47:05,910
What did I just say?

1845
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:07,170
I like,

1846
00:47:07,170 --> 00:47:09,000
my favorite has always been Machida,

1847
00:47:09,210 --> 00:47:10,110
which he's great tennis.

1848
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:11,130
Like there's something,

1849
00:47:11,131 --> 00:47:14,580
there's a beauty and grace
to the way he fights.

1850
00:47:14,581 --> 00:47:15,750
He reminds me of a matador.

1851
00:47:15,751 --> 00:47:18,720
He kind of looks like a matador and it's
got that kind of dark complexion and

1852
00:47:18,721 --> 00:47:19,501
dark hair.

1853
00:47:19,501 --> 00:47:20,660
And um,

1854
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:24,680
I think Machita we spent too much of
his career at fighting at two oh five

1855
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:25,110
degree.

1856
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:27,180
He's too small for one 85 which is crazy.

1857
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:29,980
Rockhold tore some rock holds a and

1858
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:30,551
the and,

1859
00:47:30,551 --> 00:47:31,221
and you know,

1860
00:47:31,221 --> 00:47:32,054
uh,

1861
00:47:32,110 --> 00:47:34,360
who's Weidman is wave
is way more here too.

1862
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:35,710
I just don't know anything about a fight.

1863
00:47:35,711 --> 00:47:38,550
Romero who's going to more
from to from Marilyn's Hue.

1864
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,220
So he's taking the abuse
from these huge guys.

1865
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:42,910
Yeah.

1866
00:47:42,910 --> 00:47:46,930
I just don't know how he fought
at two oh five for so long.

1867
00:47:46,931 --> 00:47:50,530
He would weigh in at two oh three
and like not cut any weight at all.

1868
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:52,210
And then fight Tito Ortiz.

1869
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:53,190
Who Weight two 30 or so.

1870
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,370
This is a big giant dude.

1871
00:47:54,970 --> 00:47:58,860
I mean he fought Jago Silva was
huge at two oh five he taught.

1872
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,490
Fought some big ass fucking dude,

1873
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:03,070
but he fought very brilliantly.

1874
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:03,904
But he's also,

1875
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:09,190
he's in his late thirties I think
he's 37 or 38 and your body just,

1876
00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:10,720
you only have so many miles.

1877
00:48:10,850 --> 00:48:11,120
Yeah.

1878
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:11,600
You know,

1879
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:12,341
there's just,

1880
00:48:12,341 --> 00:48:12,670
you don't,

1881
00:48:12,670 --> 00:48:14,050
you don't get to change the tires.

1882
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:14,710
You know,

1883
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:16,280
getting these upgraded suspension.

1884
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:17,061
He's taking some,

1885
00:48:17,061 --> 00:48:18,250
he's taking some abuse.

1886
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:18,431
Well,

1887
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:20,440
the Rockhold fight was the most abusive,

1888
00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:21,370
never to fun.

1889
00:48:21,850 --> 00:48:22,560
I didn't like that.

1890
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:27,010
I mean Jon Jones choked him out and
when a guy choked you out like that,

1891
00:48:27,011 --> 00:48:28,360
that's not nearly as bad.

1892
00:48:28,510 --> 00:48:31,300
A shogun Kao down
essentially with one punch.

1893
00:48:31,810 --> 00:48:34,330
So those were like two big losses before.

1894
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:37,510
But this Rockhold fight
was a fucking molestation.

1895
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:38,710
It was a brutal,

1896
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:39,241
no,

1897
00:48:39,241 --> 00:48:40,120
you shouldn't say that word.

1898
00:48:40,121 --> 00:48:41,800
I should say it was an assault.

1899
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:42,893
That's what it was.

1900
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:44,423
Bye Bye.

1901
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,270
That's what I didn't
like about that fight.

1902
00:48:46,570 --> 00:48:50,800
By the end it was an assault on a
helpless victim and I feel like,

1903
00:48:50,830 --> 00:48:53,110
I feel like you were saying this too,

1904
00:48:53,111 --> 00:48:55,990
that that's a fight that should have
been ended probably on the stool.

1905
00:48:56,050 --> 00:48:56,411
I agree.

1906
00:48:56,411 --> 00:48:57,910
And you know his corner
should end up well,

1907
00:48:57,911 --> 00:49:00,190
they didn't even put his
mouthpiece in for the second round.

1908
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:01,150
We didn't know about it.

1909
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:03,790
He was saying something to the referee
and pointing in his mouth and I was

1910
00:49:03,791 --> 00:49:06,190
trying to figure out what he was
squaring off while they were in it.

1911
00:49:06,470 --> 00:49:08,020
When he was on the bottom,

1912
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:10,030
can Rockhold was beating him up.

1913
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:11,320
He pointed,

1914
00:49:11,321 --> 00:49:14,830
said to the referee something and pointed
to his mouth that he didn't have a

1915
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:16,810
mouthpiece and the
referee didn't pick it up.

1916
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:17,580
I mean,

1917
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:19,300
you've got to check that the corners,

1918
00:49:19,330 --> 00:49:20,680
it's their ultimately their fault,

1919
00:49:20,681 --> 00:49:21,850
but the referee fucked up too.

1920
00:49:21,851 --> 00:49:24,780
You can't let a guy fight and get the
shit beat out of them with no mouthpiece

1921
00:49:24,790 --> 00:49:25,510
and,

1922
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:25,930
well,

1923
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:29,650
can we go back to that question about
the conflict you feel between being a

1924
00:49:29,651 --> 00:49:30,484
sports fan?

1925
00:49:30,490 --> 00:49:32,880
I'm a fan of this
massive fan of the sport.

1926
00:49:32,890 --> 00:49:33,880
No one's a bigger fan than you.

1927
00:49:33,881 --> 00:49:35,110
I'm a huge fan of the sport too,

1928
00:49:35,410 --> 00:49:36,910
but also that sense of,

1929
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:38,573
ah,

1930
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:39,573
you know,

1931
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:41,210
dividedness you know,

1932
00:49:41,211 --> 00:49:41,560
that,

1933
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:41,771
that,

1934
00:49:41,771 --> 00:49:42,400
you know,

1935
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:43,150
I mean,

1936
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:44,260
here's how I feel about it.

1937
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:44,560
It's like,

1938
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:48,130
I feel like we're trapped in
this kind of devil's bargain.

1939
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:48,941
You know,

1940
00:49:48,941 --> 00:49:50,020
we love the sport.

1941
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:52,860
We admire the athletes
who've been worship a movie,

1942
00:49:53,150 --> 00:49:53,801
admire their,

1943
00:49:53,801 --> 00:49:54,710
their heroism,

1944
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:55,990
that courage or skill,

1945
00:49:56,050 --> 00:49:56,531
stamina,

1946
00:49:56,531 --> 00:49:57,364
all of it.

1947
00:49:57,660 --> 00:49:58,180
Um,

1948
00:49:58,180 --> 00:49:59,830
and we love the drama of it.

1949
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:01,150
We love the savagery of it.

1950
00:50:01,330 --> 00:50:02,740
We love the technique of it.

1951
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:03,580
Um,

1952
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:06,490
but at the same time we know
it costs these guys too much.

1953
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:08,920
And I guess my question is,

1954
00:50:08,921 --> 00:50:10,780
is there any way out of
this devil's bargain?

1955
00:50:10,810 --> 00:50:15,810
Is there a way that we can make these
sports the sports safer than it is?

1956
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:18,221
Well,

1957
00:50:18,221 --> 00:50:18,580
um,

1958
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:22,120
I think you and I are both in agreement
with the gloves issue and you wrote

1959
00:50:22,121 --> 00:50:23,780
something about it and um,

1960
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:25,240
I discussed it with Sam Harris.

1961
00:50:25,241 --> 00:50:26,650
I've discussed it with a bunch of people.

1962
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:27,890
I feel like,

1963
00:50:27,891 --> 00:50:28,724
and

1964
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:32,240
this would kind of be contradictory for
people who don't train in martial arts,

1965
00:50:32,241 --> 00:50:33,230
but I'll try to explain it,

1966
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:34,430
uh,

1967
00:50:34,430 --> 00:50:36,080
visually for people who watch this,

1968
00:50:36,081 --> 00:50:39,500
which is a much smaller
percentage of the population.

1969
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:41,360
If you look at someone's wrist,

1970
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:42,110
um,

1971
00:50:42,110 --> 00:50:42,651
well your wrist,

1972
00:50:42,651 --> 00:50:43,730
when you hit things,

1973
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:46,010
your risk tends to wiggle around.

1974
00:50:46,011 --> 00:50:47,330
It flexes and it,

1975
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:51,050
it's very hard to keep your wrists
stiffed and hit things hard,

1976
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:55,700
especially repeatedly when you're
bouncing your wrist off of elbows and

1977
00:50:55,701 --> 00:50:56,740
shoulders and,

1978
00:50:56,890 --> 00:51:01,340
and even foreheads you're eating tend
to break your hands much easier if you

1979
00:51:01,341 --> 00:51:02,390
don't have wraps.

1980
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:04,150
And when you see a fighter in the UFC,

1981
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:05,030
they have those gloves on.

1982
00:51:05,031 --> 00:51:08,090
Those gloves aren't really
protecting the other opponent,

1983
00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:11,060
the opponent of the person you're punching
nearly as much as they're protecting

1984
00:51:11,061 --> 00:51:13,100
the per person who's
punching the opponent.

1985
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,160
But the big thing to me
is not just the gloves,

1986
00:51:16,190 --> 00:51:17,370
it's the raps.

1987
00:51:17,390 --> 00:51:17,920
Yeah.

1988
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:18,020
Uh,

1989
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:21,410
feel like when you tape
up your wrist to cast it,

1990
00:51:21,470 --> 00:51:21,860
yeah.

1991
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:24,110
You can tape up your wrist
and you tape up your hands.

1992
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:25,590
You make that thing hardest.

1993
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:27,290
Fuck before I work out,

1994
00:51:27,291 --> 00:51:29,540
before I hit the bag or hit
the pads or anything like that,

1995
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:32,060
I taped this fucking bitch down.

1996
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:33,950
I go in between my knuckles,

1997
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:34,970
I have uh,

1998
00:51:34,970 --> 00:51:35,331
these,

1999
00:51:35,331 --> 00:51:38,990
these pads that I put over my knuckles
and I tape over them and then I go

2000
00:51:38,991 --> 00:51:41,100
everything with the athletic tape and,

2001
00:51:41,101 --> 00:51:41,811
but at the end of it,

2002
00:51:41,811 --> 00:51:46,100
that fucking saying you could
slam things within and it just,

2003
00:51:46,101 --> 00:51:46,970
it's unnatural.

2004
00:51:47,130 --> 00:51:47,963
You get,

2005
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:51,140
you have an unnatural
situation with your hands.

2006
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:52,700
And when people say,

2007
00:51:52,701 --> 00:51:53,930
well it looks barbaric,

2008
00:51:53,931 --> 00:51:54,840
if you bare knuckle,

2009
00:51:54,890 --> 00:51:55,723
let me tell you something.

2010
00:51:55,990 --> 00:51:57,890
You would be way better off with me.

2011
00:51:57,891 --> 00:51:59,180
Bare knuckle punching in,

2012
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:00,080
punching you,

2013
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:02,540
then you would with me
kicking you with my Shin.

2014
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:04,210
And that's totally legal.

2015
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:04,660
Yeah.

2016
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:05,810
We head kicks.

2017
00:52:06,110 --> 00:52:11,110
He'll like when you see like Terry Adam
versus Edson Barboza and Edson Barboza,

2018
00:52:11,210 --> 00:52:12,320
we'll kicks him in the head.

2019
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:12,860
Yeah.

2020
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:17,030
There is not a fucking punch that's
ever been thrown by a human being ever.

2021
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:20,280
That as the kind of power
that a fucking wheel kick ass.

2022
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:23,270
Your legs are especially
not that weight class.

2023
00:52:23,271 --> 00:52:24,650
And you'd have to have like the biggest,

2024
00:52:24,651 --> 00:52:27,530
most giant heavyweight boxer and still,

2025
00:52:27,531 --> 00:52:30,430
I don't think they could probably
punch as hard as a worldclass.

2026
00:52:30,470 --> 00:52:32,360
Kickboxer can throw a kick like that.

2027
00:52:32,470 --> 00:52:33,470
It was Kickstarter rare though.

2028
00:52:33,471 --> 00:52:33,801
I mean,

2029
00:52:33,801 --> 00:52:34,381
we're very rare.

2030
00:52:34,381 --> 00:52:37,610
One of the things that was interesting
to me is there's a paper out in some,

2031
00:52:37,611 --> 00:52:37,911
some,

2032
00:52:37,911 --> 00:52:40,220
some journal like the Canadian
Journal of Criminology,

2033
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:41,360
not criminology and I'm sorry,

2034
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:42,253
uh,

2035
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:42,620
uh,

2036
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:43,880
sports medicine or something like that.

2037
00:52:44,170 --> 00:52:44,600
Um,

2038
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:46,650
went through all of
UFC fights over like a,

2039
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:47,530
I'll say a decade.

2040
00:52:47,530 --> 00:52:48,363
Um,

2041
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:53,380
and saw how they ended and when
it came to Chios Kaos and Tkos,

2042
00:52:53,391 --> 00:52:55,940
85% of them were from the hands.

2043
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:56,811
Um,

2044
00:52:56,811 --> 00:52:57,890
so my feeling is,

2045
00:52:57,891 --> 00:52:58,041
you know,

2046
00:52:58,041 --> 00:52:58,311
again,

2047
00:52:58,311 --> 00:53:00,500
people have the wrong
idea about these gloves.

2048
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:01,790
They really have the wrong idea.

2049
00:53:01,791 --> 00:53:03,410
They think it makes the sport safer,

2050
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:04,270
uh,

2051
00:53:04,270 --> 00:53:04,590
and it,

2052
00:53:04,590 --> 00:53:05,930
and I think they can make it safer,

2053
00:53:06,230 --> 00:53:09,440
safer and it does make it
safer for the guys hands.

2054
00:53:09,830 --> 00:53:12,740
And the cost of that is
making an exponentially more
dangerous for that other

2055
00:53:12,741 --> 00:53:13,574
guy's brain.

2056
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:14,930
You take those gloves off,

2057
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:17,300
those guys cannot throw
their hands around like that.

2058
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:18,500
If you glove it up,

2059
00:53:18,530 --> 00:53:19,363
tape it up,

2060
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:21,170
you turn that fragile,

2061
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,700
vulnerable fist.

2062
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:23,290
Andrew,

2063
00:53:23,290 --> 00:53:27,300
a brutally dangerous cudgel and you could
throw around from all these different

2064
00:53:27,301 --> 00:53:28,050
angles.

2065
00:53:28,050 --> 00:53:30,810
You can throw Roy Nelson
Style overhand rights.

2066
00:53:30,811 --> 00:53:32,910
You can't throw that punch
with without gloves on.

2067
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:33,893
You break your hand.

2068
00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:37,450
I mean instantly you kill
yourself cause that score,

2069
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:39,240
he punched the score with a bare hand.

2070
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:40,860
The scope punches you back.

2071
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:41,370
Yeah.

2072
00:53:41,370 --> 00:53:42,480
If you hit someone,

2073
00:53:42,481 --> 00:53:45,570
if someone just ducks down and you
hit him with a straight punch on the

2074
00:53:45,571 --> 00:53:46,404
forehead,

2075
00:53:46,650 --> 00:53:48,600
it's like punching a wall.

2076
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:52,030
So to me is that there was this tragedy
that happened and it happened in boxing

2077
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:53,800
happen in boxing in 1867,

2078
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:54,251
you know,

2079
00:53:54,251 --> 00:53:55,001
boxing was on the,

2080
00:53:55,001 --> 00:53:55,421
on the,

2081
00:53:55,421 --> 00:53:58,990
on the verge of getting outlawed
basically for being savage.

2082
00:53:59,450 --> 00:53:59,891
And they said,

2083
00:53:59,891 --> 00:54:00,150
okay,

2084
00:54:00,150 --> 00:54:01,030
we'll change the rules,

2085
00:54:01,031 --> 00:54:05,140
we'll add these different elements would
make it possible for referees to stop

2086
00:54:05,141 --> 00:54:07,600
fight and we'll put
pillows on the guys first.

2087
00:54:07,930 --> 00:54:10,120
So it was a well intended thing.

2088
00:54:10,510 --> 00:54:11,650
The well-intended thing,

2089
00:54:11,651 --> 00:54:13,210
we were well intended,

2090
00:54:13,211 --> 00:54:14,350
humanitarian gesture,

2091
00:54:14,770 --> 00:54:18,820
we'll make this the sport face safer by
put in these pills on these guys' hands.

2092
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:23,800
And the UFC made exactly the same
mistake a 130 years later or something.

2093
00:54:24,110 --> 00:54:24,320
Uh,

2094
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:26,890
they were on the verge
of getting outlawed.

2095
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:29,500
They were having all kinds
of political problems.

2096
00:54:29,501 --> 00:54:30,520
And so they reformed.

2097
00:54:30,521 --> 00:54:30,911
They said,

2098
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:31,001
well,

2099
00:54:31,001 --> 00:54:31,220
we're gonna,

2100
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:36,220
we're gonna outlaw these really brutal
looking techniques and we are also going

2101
00:54:36,431 --> 00:54:40,990
to take away the prime symbol in the
public's mind of the savagery of cage

2102
00:54:40,991 --> 00:54:41,380
fighting,

2103
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:42,880
which is bare fisted fighting.

2104
00:54:43,290 --> 00:54:46,930
It's even in our language when we say
we're going to take the gloves off,

2105
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:47,620
right?

2106
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:51,130
That means we're gonna resort to a
really primitive style of brutality.

2107
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:52,210
Um,

2108
00:54:52,210 --> 00:54:52,870
and so,

2109
00:54:52,870 --> 00:54:53,703
uh,

2110
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:54,761
so it was just,

2111
00:54:54,761 --> 00:54:58,420
it was a well-intended gesture
that backfired in a tragic way.

2112
00:54:58,930 --> 00:55:00,910
So people think that the,

2113
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:04,690
the sort of savagery and
the damage and the danger,

2114
00:55:04,691 --> 00:55:05,920
the neurological danger,

2115
00:55:05,921 --> 00:55:10,660
especially of fighting is intrinsic
to the sport and unavoidable.

2116
00:55:11,110 --> 00:55:12,190
And it's not really true.

2117
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:15,730
You could massively decrease the,

2118
00:55:15,731 --> 00:55:18,820
the danger of the neurological danger
of the sport just by taking off the

2119
00:55:18,821 --> 00:55:19,654
gloves.

2120
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:20,261
Could you,

2121
00:55:20,261 --> 00:55:23,440
because a big percentage of
the blows that guys received,

2122
00:55:23,441 --> 00:55:26,710
they're receiving training and you're
very unlikely to train bare knuckle,

2123
00:55:28,150 --> 00:55:29,500
so you're going to steal.

2124
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:30,790
You could still get tagged.

2125
00:55:30,850 --> 00:55:31,683
You're right.

2126
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:32,793
You're right.

2127
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:34,080
There's also a,

2128
00:55:34,110 --> 00:55:37,030
an in paeds grappling in a lot of ways.

2129
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:37,630
The gloves did.

2130
00:55:37,630 --> 00:55:37,720
Yeah,

2131
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:38,101
of course.

2132
00:55:38,101 --> 00:55:38,570
Yeah.

2133
00:55:38,570 --> 00:55:40,480
They get in the way of a lot of chokes.

2134
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:41,230
Um,

2135
00:55:41,230 --> 00:55:44,570
they get in the way their handles
and you can't get the men,

2136
00:55:45,190 --> 00:55:46,630
you close your neck up,

2137
00:55:46,631 --> 00:55:47,464
you can't get your gloves.

2138
00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:50,920
Some guys use them intelligently
to actually finish chokes.

2139
00:55:50,921 --> 00:55:52,120
I've seen Josh Thompson,

2140
00:55:52,121 --> 00:55:53,470
who's a very clever fellow.

2141
00:55:54,010 --> 00:55:54,730
He's uh,

2142
00:55:54,730 --> 00:55:59,730
done rear naked chokes where he reaches
under his own gloves and chokes guys and

2143
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:02,730
foundation foundations
that it's quite sure,

2144
00:56:02,750 --> 00:56:03,920
but I'm not sure.

2145
00:56:04,390 --> 00:56:06,400
I can't reach inside
the other guys' glove.

2146
00:56:06,430 --> 00:56:07,810
You can't reach inside
the other gods glove.

2147
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:10,660
I think you can grab your own glove
that you can grab your shorts,

2148
00:56:10,690 --> 00:56:12,550
you can grab your shorts
to defend yourself.

2149
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:15,100
You can't grab your shorts
to finish a technique done.

2150
00:56:15,850 --> 00:56:16,683
I don't think,

2151
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:20,470
I think if you had like
there is a position that you
could get where you could

2152
00:56:20,471 --> 00:56:24,010
have your arm wrapped around the
guy's neck and grab own shorts.

2153
00:56:24,150 --> 00:56:24,490
Yeah.

2154
00:56:24,490 --> 00:56:24,801
And,

2155
00:56:24,801 --> 00:56:27,520
and use your own shorts
to aid in the choke.

2156
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:28,720
I'm wonder if you could do that.

2157
00:56:29,230 --> 00:56:30,520
I wonder if you could do it on offense.

2158
00:56:30,521 --> 00:56:33,070
I probably should know this
as soon as I do it for living.

2159
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:33,701
But,

2160
00:56:33,701 --> 00:56:33,821
uh,

2161
00:56:33,821 --> 00:56:36,040
I know that you can use it defensively,

2162
00:56:36,041 --> 00:56:37,390
which is big with Kimora.

2163
00:56:37,391 --> 00:56:37,980
Yeah.

2164
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:41,740
If a guy is going for a shoulder lock
and you've reached deep into your shorts

2165
00:56:41,741 --> 00:56:42,574
and you hold onto them,

2166
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:46,710
it could be just enough to protect you
to keep you from forgetting tapped yet.

2167
00:56:47,550 --> 00:56:48,280
Um,

2168
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:48,641
but I think,

2169
00:56:48,641 --> 00:56:48,810
you know,

2170
00:56:48,810 --> 00:56:48,950
if,

2171
00:56:48,950 --> 00:56:49,541
if you take the,

2172
00:56:49,541 --> 00:56:50,680
if you take the gloves off to,

2173
00:56:50,770 --> 00:56:51,603
uh,

2174
00:56:51,610 --> 00:56:52,930
I've already with some people about this,

2175
00:56:52,931 --> 00:56:53,200
they're like,

2176
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:53,351
well,

2177
00:56:53,351 --> 00:56:55,990
if you did that and guys would
just throw more so more kicks,

2178
00:56:55,991 --> 00:56:56,681
they throw more needs,

2179
00:56:56,681 --> 00:56:57,280
they throw Morrell,

2180
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:57,970
they would,

2181
00:56:57,970 --> 00:56:59,680
there'll be a little more
like bare knuckle Moyie Thai.

2182
00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:00,310
Yeah.

2183
00:57:00,310 --> 00:57:00,821
But I think,

2184
00:57:00,821 --> 00:57:01,540
you know,

2185
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:04,330
I think paradoxically taken
the gloves off would also,

2186
00:57:04,331 --> 00:57:07,540
we can all the other weapons because
it's really hard to kick somebody in the

2187
00:57:07,541 --> 00:57:10,270
head lot if you're Donald's Serone well,

2188
00:57:10,271 --> 00:57:10,600
but,

2189
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:14,080
but partly it's because they
have to respect as fis and
had a lot of respect for

2190
00:57:14,081 --> 00:57:14,914
his fists.

2191
00:57:14,950 --> 00:57:15,191
Yeah.

2192
00:57:15,191 --> 00:57:16,960
But it's also like you get close to him,

2193
00:57:16,961 --> 00:57:19,540
you get need like you get elbowed.

2194
00:57:19,810 --> 00:57:20,100
You know,

2195
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:21,250
I I see,

2196
00:57:21,251 --> 00:57:24,520
I kind of disagree with that cause I think
it really just depends upon what kind

2197
00:57:24,521 --> 00:57:26,800
of skillset you get into MMA with.

2198
00:57:27,250 --> 00:57:30,850
If you get a guy who was a really good
kicker and you take away the gloves,

2199
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:32,710
you just made his kicks better.

2200
00:57:32,990 --> 00:57:33,491
He does now.

2201
00:57:33,491 --> 00:57:36,280
He doesn't have to worry
nearly as much as that's true.

2202
00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:37,000
That's a good point.

2203
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:37,470
I was thinking it,

2204
00:57:37,470 --> 00:57:38,303
the other guy,

2205
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:39,191
uh,

2206
00:57:39,191 --> 00:57:42,760
the defender wouldn't be as vulnerable
to the kick because he doesn't,

2207
00:57:42,790 --> 00:57:43,240
he can,

2208
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:47,050
he can look for the kick more cause he
didn't have to be aware of the other guys

2209
00:57:47,051 --> 00:57:47,380
fist.

2210
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:47,711
But you're right,

2211
00:57:47,711 --> 00:57:48,910
the kicker doesn't have to worry about it.

2212
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:49,530
It's,

2213
00:57:49,530 --> 00:57:50,280
that's a good point.

2214
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:54,220
And one of the biggest problems with the
gloves is the fact that the fingers are

2215
00:57:54,221 --> 00:57:57,220
wide open and guys are poking each
other in the eye all the time.

2216
00:57:57,670 --> 00:57:58,660
It's a huge issue.

2217
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:01,750
The UFC has tried to figure
out a way to do it to,

2218
00:58:01,751 --> 00:58:02,441
to mitigate it,

2219
00:58:02,441 --> 00:58:05,830
to have the same gloves but make
something where they curve more.

2220
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:10,390
I think Bella tour came out with his
Everlast glove that I think has two,

2221
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:11,590
two,

2222
00:58:11,590 --> 00:58:13,540
two opposing benefits.

2223
00:58:13,541 --> 00:58:15,270
Like it's more curved,

2224
00:58:15,370 --> 00:58:18,550
which I think is better to avoid some
of the posts like the old pride gloves.

2225
00:58:18,551 --> 00:58:19,000
Yes.

2226
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:24,000
But also it's got more padding on the
top to protect the knuckles so they have

2227
00:58:24,701 --> 00:58:25,810
less broken hands.

2228
00:58:26,170 --> 00:58:28,900
But that means to me that
guys can punch harder.

2229
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:30,460
So it's like you can,

2230
00:58:30,490 --> 00:58:31,810
you're more free to punch,

2231
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:33,400
but you're less lucky to poke.

2232
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:34,420
I will take that.

2233
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:38,050
I'll take the less likely to get the
iPods because I think the I pokes or of,

2234
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:43,140
that's a huge tragic issue for people
who aren't familiar with the sport.

2235
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:45,370
Muay Thai,

2236
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:47,050
the art of Thai boxing.

2237
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:47,710
Um,

2238
00:58:47,710 --> 00:58:48,220
they,

2239
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:52,990
they have a very specific
style of using the hands.

2240
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:53,411
Well,

2241
00:58:53,411 --> 00:58:56,830
they'll like put the hands on the
forehead and they'll throw knees,

2242
00:58:57,010 --> 00:58:59,140
they'll put the hands up
and they'll throw kicks.

2243
00:58:59,141 --> 00:59:00,070
They'll put the hand dug.

2244
00:59:00,310 --> 00:59:01,210
They have a lot,

2245
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:03,070
especially in different practitioners.

2246
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:05,040
They have a lot of ways of using,

2247
00:59:05,060 --> 00:59:07,330
but when they're doing it
in the gym or in the ring,

2248
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:11,140
they're usually wearing big boxing
gloves and the boxing gloves don't have

2249
00:59:11,141 --> 00:59:12,340
anything free to poke.

2250
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:14,710
But fingers in MMA gloves,

2251
00:59:14,711 --> 00:59:16,180
the fingers are completely exposed.

2252
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:18,310
And when guys utilize the same techniques,

2253
00:59:18,311 --> 00:59:19,480
try to keep a guy off them.

2254
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:20,110
They,

2255
00:59:20,110 --> 00:59:22,160
they oftentimes up poking guys

2256
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:25,220
right in the eyes and they
cause irreparable damage.

2257
00:59:25,221 --> 00:59:26,420
Like guys like Alan Belcher,

2258
00:59:26,421 --> 00:59:28,310
he's been out of the UFC for a long time.

2259
00:59:28,311 --> 00:59:29,990
He had knee surgery,

2260
00:59:29,991 --> 00:59:31,220
like significant eye surgery.

2261
00:59:31,221 --> 00:59:33,230
Michael Bisping had
significant eye surgery.

2262
00:59:33,530 --> 00:59:34,870
He has oil in his eye.

2263
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:35,713
This thing does,

2264
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:37,310
you look at one of his eyes,

2265
00:59:37,311 --> 00:59:38,390
he was different color.

2266
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:39,890
It's like you don't see his pupil.

2267
00:59:40,220 --> 00:59:41,660
It's to protect his retina.

2268
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:42,613
Yikes.

2269
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:44,420
But he's such a fucking gangster.

2270
00:59:44,421 --> 00:59:44,721
That guy,

2271
00:59:44,721 --> 00:59:45,161
he's dealing,

2272
00:59:45,161 --> 00:59:46,500
they're thrown down with one bomb.

2273
00:59:46,501 --> 00:59:48,410
I think again though,

2274
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:50,150
like when through these guys quit.

2275
00:59:50,510 --> 00:59:50,930
Well,

2276
00:59:50,930 --> 00:59:53,120
he still worldclass clearly,

2277
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:53,810
you know,

2278
00:59:53,810 --> 00:59:54,800
I mean he still,

2279
00:59:54,801 --> 00:59:55,100
uh,

2280
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:55,671
he just,

2281
00:59:55,671 --> 00:59:56,504
uh,

2282
00:59:56,510 --> 00:59:58,610
beat CB away and uh,

2283
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:00,310
he showed he's still worldclass.

2284
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:02,180
He's still one of the
best guys in the world.

2285
01:00:02,181 --> 01:00:03,200
The [inaudible] victory.

2286
01:00:03,740 --> 01:00:03,981
I mean,

2287
01:00:03,981 --> 01:00:04,820
that guy has a chair.

2288
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:05,330
I mean,

2289
01:00:05,330 --> 01:00:09,530
he really does have a chance till he
really has a dream and that dream is to be

2290
01:00:09,531 --> 01:00:10,130
a world champion.

2291
01:00:10,130 --> 01:00:14,750
And that mindset that he has that allows
him to fight with one fucked up by,

2292
01:00:14,990 --> 01:00:15,610
you know,

2293
01:00:15,610 --> 01:00:15,890
throughout,

2294
01:00:15,890 --> 01:00:17,610
and he has got something
wrong with his neck man.

2295
01:00:17,630 --> 01:00:20,270
He's always like banged up and
he's been fighting forever.

2296
01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:25,040
He's also been fighting clean and a lot
of his major losses are from guys who

2297
01:00:25,041 --> 01:00:25,880
weren't clean,

2298
01:00:26,570 --> 01:00:28,190
even if they weren't legally clean.

2299
01:00:28,191 --> 01:00:28,550
I mean,

2300
01:00:28,550 --> 01:00:29,840
even if what they were doing was legal,

2301
01:00:29,841 --> 01:00:31,140
like Henderson and v tour,

2302
01:00:31,430 --> 01:00:32,600
there's still weren't clean,

2303
01:00:32,650 --> 01:00:33,020
clean.

2304
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:35,150
Chael Sonnen wasn't clean.

2305
01:00:35,151 --> 01:00:36,770
I mean all these guys were not clean them.

2306
01:00:36,771 --> 01:00:36,980
Right?

2307
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:37,400
Yeah.

2308
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:41,240
Almost everybody who beat him except
Rockhold Rockhold is just a fucking freak

2309
01:00:41,241 --> 01:00:42,074
of nature.

2310
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:42,710
Yeah.

2311
01:00:42,710 --> 01:00:46,040
Freak of nature and a freak of training
with Cain Velasquez and Daniel Cormier

2312
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:47,390
every fucking day,

2313
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:48,290
you know,

2314
01:00:48,290 --> 01:00:50,960
he's just so God damn
good and long and strong,

2315
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:52,520
I don't believe are big and strong.

2316
01:00:52,521 --> 01:00:53,530
He was watered.

2317
01:00:53,580 --> 01:00:54,040
Machida,

2318
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:55,370
you know Javier Mendez was,

2319
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:56,990
we were talking about it after the fight.

2320
01:00:56,990 --> 01:00:57,261
I was like,

2321
01:00:57,261 --> 01:00:57,921
God damn.

2322
01:00:57,921 --> 01:00:58,840
I was congratulating them.

2323
01:00:58,860 --> 01:00:59,121
I was like,

2324
01:00:59,121 --> 01:00:59,954
that was insane.

2325
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:00,471
And they'll like,

2326
01:01:00,471 --> 01:01:02,000
you know what people
don't realize about him.

2327
01:01:02,001 --> 01:01:02,141
He's,

2328
01:01:02,141 --> 01:01:03,500
he's fucking strong.

2329
01:01:03,530 --> 01:01:07,550
And it's very rare that you get someone
who's real long but also really strong.

2330
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,450
I don't know what the fuck he ways
when he actually gets in there,

2331
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:14,350
but it ain't one 85 he looked young dude.

2332
01:01:14,351 --> 01:01:15,111
He dwarfs me.

2333
01:01:15,111 --> 01:01:16,270
I weighed 200 pounds and I mean,

2334
01:01:16,271 --> 01:01:17,104
I know I'm fat,

2335
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:18,410
but when I stand next to him I'm like,

2336
01:01:18,411 --> 01:01:19,370
get the fuck out of here.

2337
01:01:19,371 --> 01:01:19,791
How are you?

2338
01:01:19,791 --> 01:01:24,650
One 85 he's six foot four and he looks
like he's about to 20 when he gets into

2339
01:01:24,651 --> 01:01:25,041
the cage.

2340
01:01:25,041 --> 01:01:25,874
It's insane.

2341
01:01:26,090 --> 01:01:27,250
I don't know how he makes that wait.

2342
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:27,441
Yeah,

2343
01:01:27,441 --> 01:01:28,160
I don't either.

2344
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:30,140
I don't have no idea how he
makes that fucking weight.

2345
01:01:30,590 --> 01:01:31,390
But he does it.

2346
01:01:31,390 --> 01:01:32,720
He does it and he can fight hard,

2347
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:33,070
you know,

2348
01:01:33,070 --> 01:01:35,870
with the gloves because it's talking
about ways of making the sport safer.

2349
01:01:35,870 --> 01:01:36,110
That's,

2350
01:01:36,110 --> 01:01:36,943
that's another one.

2351
01:01:36,980 --> 01:01:37,640
I think that,

2352
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:37,851
you know,

2353
01:01:37,851 --> 01:01:38,001
the,

2354
01:01:38,001 --> 01:01:39,470
the weight cutting issue is big.

2355
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:40,670
How do you stop that?

2356
01:01:40,850 --> 01:01:42,740
It's impossible to stop probably,

2357
01:01:42,741 --> 01:01:43,910
but you know,

2358
01:01:44,210 --> 01:01:48,680
to me like the first guy to die and
the UFC is just as likely to die in the

2359
01:01:48,681 --> 01:01:49,370
sauna.

2360
01:01:49,370 --> 01:01:49,551
Well,

2361
01:01:49,551 --> 01:01:50,600
it's come very close.

2362
01:01:50,870 --> 01:01:53,090
There's been a few guys
backstage that fainted.

2363
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:56,510
They blacked out and they put pulled
out of fights because they couldn't.

2364
01:01:56,630 --> 01:01:56,871
Yeah.

2365
01:01:56,871 --> 01:01:58,010
Hanan Barao was a big one.

2366
01:01:58,011 --> 01:02:01,100
That was a big one because
a rematch with Tj Dillashaw.

2367
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:03,080
The fight was one of
the fights of the year.

2368
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:04,530
One of the upsets of the,

2369
01:02:04,580 --> 01:02:06,140
the entire history of the UFC.

2370
01:02:06,141 --> 01:02:07,130
One of the biggest upsets,

2371
01:02:07,620 --> 01:02:11,570
a spectacular performance by Tj Dillashaw
Hanan Barao trains like a monster

2372
01:02:11,571 --> 01:02:16,571
ready for this comeback and then fall
passes out in the sauna or the bath

2373
01:02:16,591 --> 01:02:16,941
bathtub,

2374
01:02:16,941 --> 01:02:17,271
I guess,

2375
01:02:17,271 --> 01:02:20,120
and cracked his head off the wall
and they wouldn't let them find

2376
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:20,231
me.

2377
01:02:20,231 --> 01:02:22,380
He knocked himself out trying
to get up out of the tub.

2378
01:02:22,460 --> 01:02:22,890
Yeah,

2379
01:02:22,890 --> 01:02:24,090
I felt like that and yoga today,

2380
01:02:24,091 --> 01:02:24,780
man.

2381
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:27,220
I felt like I was going to black
out because you really now,

2382
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:28,051
no,

2383
01:02:28,051 --> 01:02:30,000
but I mean it's like
an elevator everybody.

2384
01:02:30,070 --> 01:02:30,903
The heads house.

2385
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:32,073
Yeah.

2386
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:33,930
I do feel like I'm going to
pass out on the headstand.

2387
01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:37,950
I've felt like I've
realized what a bitch I am.

2388
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:38,870
And uh,

2389
01:02:38,870 --> 01:02:40,470
I'm like grabbing my toes.

2390
01:02:40,471 --> 01:02:40,711
I'm like,

2391
01:02:40,711 --> 01:02:40,951
God,

2392
01:02:40,951 --> 01:02:41,491
I need a break.

2393
01:02:41,491 --> 01:02:42,324
It's too hot in here.

2394
01:02:42,710 --> 01:02:46,860
He's thinking about like what these guys
have to do in the fucking sauna to drop

2395
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:50,940
20 pounds of water weight and that
they do it every three or four months.

2396
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:51,240
Yeah,

2397
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:51,640
I did.

2398
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:52,473
I,

2399
01:02:52,710 --> 01:02:54,930
I only had one actual fight.

2400
01:02:55,070 --> 01:02:55,500
Um,

2401
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:55,850
but I,

2402
01:02:55,850 --> 01:02:58,200
but I cut white twice
because the first fight I,

2403
01:02:58,201 --> 01:02:58,680
uh,

2404
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:03,680
I showed up to and my opponent fearing
the legendary fisted prowess of English

2405
01:03:03,871 --> 01:03:04,704
professors.

2406
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:06,983
He backed out.

2407
01:03:07,090 --> 01:03:08,410
He backed out the day of,

2408
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:10,800
I got on the scale and everything.

2409
01:03:10,801 --> 01:03:11,341
I'm looking around,

2410
01:03:11,341 --> 01:03:12,510
my guy's not there and you know,

2411
01:03:12,511 --> 01:03:12,810
I was,

2412
01:03:12,810 --> 01:03:13,441
I was scared.

2413
01:03:13,441 --> 01:03:13,621
You know,

2414
01:03:13,621 --> 01:03:13,820
you're,

2415
01:03:13,820 --> 01:03:13,991
it's,

2416
01:03:13,991 --> 01:03:15,150
it's nerve racking to fight,

2417
01:03:15,630 --> 01:03:17,370
but after you've gone
through the weight cut,

2418
01:03:17,371 --> 01:03:17,641
man,

2419
01:03:17,641 --> 01:03:21,720
you don't want to not find
what was wrong with him.

2420
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:23,161
He just didn't show up.

2421
01:03:23,161 --> 01:03:26,190
You're not small time amateur
shows and a lot of guys and say,

2422
01:03:26,191 --> 01:03:26,371
Hey,

2423
01:03:26,371 --> 01:03:27,330
you know this,

2424
01:03:27,331 --> 01:03:29,520
this seems like a good idea
a couple of months ago,

2425
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:31,620
but you know as it got close,

2426
01:03:31,621 --> 01:03:32,454
he wasn't hurt or anything.

2427
01:03:32,470 --> 01:03:36,090
Just we had a guy from our gym that
would have panic attacks and there was a

2428
01:03:36,091 --> 01:03:36,960
couple of fights,

2429
01:03:37,020 --> 01:03:39,330
one fight where you almost couldn't,

2430
01:03:39,380 --> 01:03:40,530
he almost couldn't do it.

2431
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:43,590
Like he was just falling apart
backstage and went up there and did it,

2432
01:03:43,591 --> 01:03:44,251
but he lost,

2433
01:03:44,251 --> 01:03:45,270
he got beat up pretty bad.

2434
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:49,230
But then another fight where he just
pulled out backstage day of the fight,

2435
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:50,753
getting prepped,

2436
01:03:50,970 --> 01:03:51,600
warming up,

2437
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:52,570
wrapping the hands the whole day.

2438
01:03:52,630 --> 01:03:54,130
I can't do fucking here to do this.

2439
01:03:54,131 --> 01:03:54,740
How really,

2440
01:03:54,740 --> 01:03:56,520
you know it happens at the UFC.

2441
01:03:57,030 --> 01:03:58,980
It happens at the UFC
and people don't know.

2442
01:03:59,160 --> 01:03:59,461
You know,

2443
01:03:59,461 --> 01:04:03,060
there's guys that wind up fighting and
there's guys that are pretty highly

2444
01:04:03,061 --> 01:04:03,890
ranked.

2445
01:04:03,890 --> 01:04:05,040
I don't want to name any names,

2446
01:04:05,041 --> 01:04:06,660
but Shaw,

2447
01:04:06,660 --> 01:04:08,610
Brendan Schaub and I were actually having
a conversation about this the other

2448
01:04:08,611 --> 01:04:12,540
day about guys that were warming
up while he was back there.

2449
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:13,381
And,

2450
01:04:13,381 --> 01:04:13,710
uh,

2451
01:04:13,710 --> 01:04:15,000
they would say to their coach,

2452
01:04:15,030 --> 01:04:16,110
I don't want to fucking do this anymore.

2453
01:04:16,140 --> 01:04:16,620
I'm done.

2454
01:04:16,620 --> 01:04:17,460
I don't want to do this anymore.

2455
01:04:17,610 --> 01:04:17,960
And like,

2456
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:18,140
dude,

2457
01:04:18,140 --> 01:04:19,530
you got to fight in an hour.

2458
01:04:19,940 --> 01:04:21,450
But then they go out and they go out.

2459
01:04:21,570 --> 01:04:22,170
Yeah,

2460
01:04:22,170 --> 01:04:22,950
yeah.

2461
01:04:22,950 --> 01:04:23,370
You know?

2462
01:04:23,370 --> 01:04:23,581
Well,

2463
01:04:23,581 --> 01:04:24,000
you know,

2464
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:24,301
I,

2465
01:04:24,301 --> 01:04:25,540
that's amazing to me because it's,

2466
01:04:25,770 --> 01:04:26,540
there's such,

2467
01:04:26,540 --> 01:04:26,850
you know,

2468
01:04:26,850 --> 01:04:31,500
part of the reason I fought finally
was because of the social pressure.

2469
01:04:31,830 --> 01:04:33,690
Like once you started off down this path,

2470
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:34,440
um,

2471
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:37,440
it becomes like this thing where like
you've told people you're going to do it

2472
01:04:37,590 --> 01:04:39,510
and everybody that Jim
knows you're going to do it.

2473
01:04:39,511 --> 01:04:40,291
And so one time I tried it,

2474
01:04:40,291 --> 01:04:42,330
I kind of tried to back out,

2475
01:04:42,660 --> 01:04:42,901
you know,

2476
01:04:42,901 --> 01:04:44,310
like months before my actual fight,

2477
01:04:44,311 --> 01:04:44,581
I said,

2478
01:04:44,581 --> 01:04:44,821
you know,

2479
01:04:44,821 --> 01:04:45,210
you know,

2480
01:04:45,210 --> 01:04:46,530
other writers have done this and you know,

2481
01:04:46,531 --> 01:04:47,364
I'm all her,

2482
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:48,990
there's no reason to do it.

2483
01:04:48,991 --> 01:04:51,330
And I went in and told one of the guys
at the gym that I was kind of leaning

2484
01:04:51,331 --> 01:04:52,320
away from doing and he's like,

2485
01:04:52,650 --> 01:04:52,921
he's like,

2486
01:04:52,921 --> 01:04:53,071
well,

2487
01:04:53,071 --> 01:04:53,290
so,

2488
01:04:53,290 --> 01:04:54,120
so you're posting it now,

2489
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:54,953
Huh?

2490
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:55,710
And,

2491
01:04:55,710 --> 01:04:56,310
uh,

2492
01:04:56,310 --> 01:04:57,360
and then I told another guy,

2493
01:04:57,400 --> 01:04:57,880
he said,

2494
01:04:57,880 --> 01:04:58,090
well,

2495
01:04:58,090 --> 01:04:58,850
see your pussy now.

2496
01:04:58,850 --> 01:04:59,610
Uh Huh.

2497
01:04:59,610 --> 01:04:59,851
Um,

2498
01:04:59,851 --> 01:05:03,870
so everybody's kind of said that
and it becomes this huge pressure,

2499
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,340
like to do it.

2500
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:05,910
Um,

2501
01:05:05,910 --> 01:05:07,590
and I felt like this,

2502
01:05:07,591 --> 01:05:08,070
uh,

2503
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:13,070
I felt more fear of failure and courage
than I did of the sort of whatever was

2504
01:05:14,881 --> 01:05:15,870
going to happen to me in the cage,

2505
01:05:16,050 --> 01:05:16,883
breaking my nose,

2506
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:17,621
whatever.

2507
01:05:17,621 --> 01:05:18,190
I felt much

2508
01:05:18,190 --> 01:05:21,250
more fear that I would just find
a way to chicken out in the end.

2509
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:21,500
I'd,

2510
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:22,530
I'd get cold feet.

2511
01:05:22,531 --> 01:05:25,450
I'd refuse to climb the
steps and get in the cage.

2512
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:27,260
Maybe I'd run for it in the cage.

2513
01:05:27,261 --> 01:05:29,080
Just sprint in circles around the outside,

2514
01:05:29,470 --> 01:05:30,310
jumped over the fence,

2515
01:05:30,311 --> 01:05:31,144
run for home.

2516
01:05:31,350 --> 01:05:31,570
You know,

2517
01:05:31,570 --> 01:05:32,830
I honestly thought that could happen,

2518
01:05:32,890 --> 01:05:33,723
you know,

2519
01:05:34,230 --> 01:05:35,390
so I can,

2520
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:36,553
so I can relate.

2521
01:05:37,090 --> 01:05:40,510
It's kind of amazing that they got backed
out backstage because there's so much

2522
01:05:40,540 --> 01:05:41,021
at that point.

2523
01:05:41,021 --> 01:05:41,854
Your whole,

2524
01:05:42,490 --> 01:05:45,190
the whole warrior society
sees you doing it,

2525
01:05:45,310 --> 01:05:46,143
you know what I mean?

2526
01:05:46,390 --> 01:05:47,260
The big blow.

2527
01:05:48,580 --> 01:05:49,410
Yeah.

2528
01:05:49,410 --> 01:05:49,681
You know,

2529
01:05:49,681 --> 01:05:52,650
sometimes guys are injured and then
they get there and they realize like,

2530
01:05:52,651 --> 01:05:53,350
I can't fuck,

2531
01:05:53,350 --> 01:05:53,760
I can't do it.

2532
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:54,630
I can't move my leg.

2533
01:05:54,631 --> 01:05:54,940
Right.

2534
01:05:54,940 --> 01:05:55,773
Yeah.

2535
01:05:55,980 --> 01:05:56,970
There's a lot of guys who fight.

2536
01:05:56,971 --> 01:05:57,804
That's another thing.

2537
01:05:57,820 --> 01:06:00,720
The guys would fight in
the UFC that are fucked up.

2538
01:06:00,750 --> 01:06:02,610
They're really injured by
the time they get in there.

2539
01:06:02,850 --> 01:06:06,510
I know guys who have hid a torn ACL tear.

2540
01:06:06,511 --> 01:06:07,101
Their ACL is,

2541
01:06:07,101 --> 01:06:10,530
we're completely blown out and
they really had no stability.

2542
01:06:10,770 --> 01:06:11,311
Like they would,

2543
01:06:11,311 --> 01:06:11,551
uh,

2544
01:06:11,551 --> 01:06:14,190
they would try to move one way or another
and then knee would just give right

2545
01:06:14,191 --> 01:06:14,850
out.

2546
01:06:14,850 --> 01:06:16,620
And there's a mean,

2547
01:06:16,621 --> 01:06:20,760
there's gotta be nothing more terrifying
than being in the octagon and competing

2548
01:06:20,790 --> 01:06:23,070
against some highly trained,

2549
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:25,530
well prepared killer.

2550
01:06:25,590 --> 01:06:26,730
And you can't even move right?

2551
01:06:26,731 --> 01:06:27,181
If you,

2552
01:06:27,181 --> 01:06:28,560
if you juke left or right,

2553
01:06:28,561 --> 01:06:31,680
your legs going to go boink if
you blown out a knee before,

2554
01:06:31,681 --> 01:06:32,240
do you know that?

2555
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:32,381
No,

2556
01:06:32,381 --> 01:06:33,214
I've never done that.

2557
01:06:33,980 --> 01:06:34,950
It's still at worst.

2558
01:06:35,310 --> 01:06:36,040
It's not the worst.

2559
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:37,680
Worst is there's obviously way worse,

2560
01:06:37,681 --> 01:06:38,710
but um,

2561
01:06:38,970 --> 01:06:42,270
it's a bad feeling because you
just know it's going to give out.

2562
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:44,910
You don't know when and you
go to move left or move.

2563
01:06:44,911 --> 01:06:45,121
Right.

2564
01:06:45,121 --> 01:06:46,500
And it just goes boing.

2565
01:06:47,190 --> 01:06:48,920
And ACL is a spare apparent,

2566
01:06:49,010 --> 01:06:49,530
uh,

2567
01:06:49,530 --> 01:06:50,970
particularly rather because a,

2568
01:06:50,971 --> 01:06:54,840
that's the big one that goes down the
center of the knee that keeps it stable

2569
01:06:54,870 --> 01:06:56,460
moving forward and it,

2570
01:06:56,461 --> 01:06:56,700
uh,

2571
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:59,430
it can blow out on a lot
of people that blows out.

2572
01:06:59,431 --> 01:07:01,620
It's like one of the more
common knee injuries.

2573
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:06,090
Dominick Cruz of course is famously
going through his second one.

2574
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:08,970
Is third a third operation?

2575
01:07:09,270 --> 01:07:10,560
A second knee though.

2576
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:11,880
Just fucking crazy.

2577
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:12,690
That's awful.

2578
01:07:12,690 --> 01:07:13,110
Yeah.

2579
01:07:13,110 --> 01:07:14,040
It's real common though.

2580
01:07:14,070 --> 01:07:15,810
George Saint Pierre got
both his knees done.

2581
01:07:16,530 --> 01:07:20,070
One of them blew out after his career
was over or after he stepped down for a

2582
01:07:20,071 --> 01:07:20,904
little bit.

2583
01:07:21,530 --> 01:07:21,980
Um,

2584
01:07:21,980 --> 01:07:22,280
you know,

2585
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:24,420
[inaudible] has had her ACL done.

2586
01:07:25,170 --> 01:07:26,960
Lot of fighters have other ACL done.

2587
01:07:27,630 --> 01:07:32,630
It's probably one of the most common
injuries that a fighters have in UFC.

2588
01:07:33,690 --> 01:07:34,261
Any sport,

2589
01:07:34,261 --> 01:07:34,561
really.

2590
01:07:34,561 --> 01:07:35,101
Acl,

2591
01:07:35,101 --> 01:07:36,630
it seems soccer.

2592
01:07:36,631 --> 01:07:38,970
Apparently it's the most
common football at time.

2593
01:07:38,971 --> 01:07:39,960
Beth football at the time,

2594
01:07:41,290 --> 01:07:43,440
you have the human bodies just fucking,

2595
01:07:43,441 --> 01:07:48,240
it's designed to get you to like age
26 and by the end you're almost dead.

2596
01:07:48,570 --> 01:07:49,080
Yeah.

2597
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:51,540
Saber Tooth Tigers are looking
for you to show up limping.

2598
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:52,713
That's true.

2599
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:54,720
It's just shit design man.

2600
01:07:54,740 --> 01:07:55,240
Yeah.

2601
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:58,270
Well it's a shit design for playing NFL
football for a punching people in the

2602
01:07:58,271 --> 01:08:01,210
head is a shit shit design
for fighting for a living.

2603
01:08:01,330 --> 01:08:01,721
You know what I mean?

2604
01:08:01,721 --> 01:08:02,020
Yeah.

2605
01:08:02,020 --> 01:08:02,853
I mean,

2606
01:08:03,340 --> 01:08:04,660
it's not made for that.

2607
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:05,050
No.

2608
01:08:05,050 --> 01:08:05,850
You know,

2609
01:08:05,850 --> 01:08:06,190
that's,

2610
01:08:06,190 --> 01:08:06,630
that's,

2611
01:08:06,630 --> 01:08:07,630
that's a bit much.

2612
01:08:07,690 --> 01:08:07,870
Well,

2613
01:08:07,870 --> 01:08:10,810
when you see an NFL player and a,

2614
01:08:10,811 --> 01:08:11,980
I've only met a few of them,

2615
01:08:12,220 --> 01:08:13,630
but when you meet them it's like fucking,

2616
01:08:13,631 --> 01:08:15,500
they were like giants
from game of Thrones.

2617
01:08:16,430 --> 01:08:17,390
That's a real person.

2618
01:08:17,391 --> 01:08:18,740
Jesus fucking Christ.

2619
01:08:19,250 --> 01:08:21,980
I remember one time I
was in Phoenix and uh,

2620
01:08:22,070 --> 01:08:22,401
we,

2621
01:08:22,401 --> 01:08:22,900
we had,

2622
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:23,180
uh,

2623
01:08:23,180 --> 01:08:25,220
just got done with the show.

2624
01:08:25,250 --> 01:08:29,540
We did a comedy show at the Tempe Improv
and then we went to a bar and when we

2625
01:08:29,541 --> 01:08:30,291
went to a bar,

2626
01:08:30,291 --> 01:08:33,350
there was this big line of people that
we're trying to get to this place.

2627
01:08:33,351 --> 01:08:38,120
We're meeting our friend there and one
of these guys was an NFL player and he

2628
01:08:38,121 --> 01:08:38,550
just sort,

2629
01:08:38,550 --> 01:08:43,010
it was like a man amongst children whose
just like moving through this crowd.

2630
01:08:43,011 --> 01:08:48,011
He was about six foot seven and he was
probably 350 pounds and he was so fucking

2631
01:08:49,311 --> 01:08:49,581
big.

2632
01:08:49,581 --> 01:08:51,920
And like you looked at him and
just go where you feel like a girl.

2633
01:08:52,540 --> 01:08:53,540
Do you feel like a girl?

2634
01:08:53,541 --> 01:08:54,140
I was.

2635
01:08:54,140 --> 01:08:54,980
I have a friend like that,

2636
01:08:54,981 --> 01:08:55,280
you know,

2637
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:57,860
if he'd played a big time
college football and you're six,

2638
01:08:57,861 --> 01:08:59,540
seven 200 high,

2639
01:08:59,541 --> 01:09:03,020
two hundreds and I'd stand up with
them at the bar and it was like,

2640
01:09:03,021 --> 01:09:04,460
and I'd be looking at his tits,

2641
01:09:04,710 --> 01:09:05,230
you know,

2642
01:09:05,230 --> 01:09:05,900
and I'd be like,

2643
01:09:05,900 --> 01:09:06,980
this is how you had talked to him.

2644
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:07,431
I'm like,

2645
01:09:07,431 --> 01:09:08,810
this is what it feels like for women.

2646
01:09:09,330 --> 01:09:09,590
Yeah.

2647
01:09:09,590 --> 01:09:10,041
All the time.

2648
01:09:10,041 --> 01:09:12,680
They're looking up over this
guy that can just do this,

2649
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:15,350
except they get turned on by
them and they want to fuck them.

2650
01:09:15,410 --> 01:09:15,770
That's true.

2651
01:09:15,770 --> 01:09:16,431
That's different.

2652
01:09:16,431 --> 01:09:17,600
I hope you didn't get turned out well.

2653
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:17,851
No.

2654
01:09:17,851 --> 01:09:18,680
If you did,

2655
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:19,110
that's fine.

2656
01:09:19,110 --> 01:09:19,943
But,

2657
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:20,960
um,

2658
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:21,820
but it's more of a worrisome,

2659
01:09:21,830 --> 01:09:25,670
like is he going to try to fuck me because
I hope it doesn't cause I'll have no

2660
01:09:25,671 --> 01:09:26,210
choice.

2661
01:09:26,210 --> 01:09:26,451
Yeah,

2662
01:09:26,451 --> 01:09:27,170
there's no,

2663
01:09:27,170 --> 01:09:30,140
there's no equality when it
comes to physical attributes.

2664
01:09:30,380 --> 01:09:33,950
There's certain people that were just
given a way better genetic roll the dice

2665
01:09:34,430 --> 01:09:34,820
when it comes.

2666
01:09:34,820 --> 01:09:35,001
I mean,

2667
01:09:35,001 --> 01:09:36,200
that's why we have weight classes.

2668
01:09:36,201 --> 01:09:41,201
It's why mighty mouse can never fight
Jon Jones is now the argument can take

2669
01:09:41,211 --> 01:09:41,521
place.

2670
01:09:41,521 --> 01:09:43,820
So as to who's better pound for pound?

2671
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:46,970
John are mighty mouse and there's
a lot of arguments both ways,

2672
01:09:46,971 --> 01:09:49,130
but as far as like what
would happen if they fight,

2673
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:50,000
there's no argument.

2674
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:50,470
There's no,

2675
01:09:50,470 --> 01:09:51,470
no argument at all.

2676
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:52,333
I mean,

2677
01:09:52,790 --> 01:09:56,660
Jon Jones is a talented enough where he
probably could fight and beat most of

2678
01:09:56,661 --> 01:09:57,201
the heavyweights,

2679
01:09:57,201 --> 01:09:58,460
if not all the heavyweights.

2680
01:09:58,461 --> 01:09:59,294
I think he,

2681
01:09:59,300 --> 01:09:59,820
yeah.

2682
01:09:59,820 --> 01:10:00,340
Yeah.

2683
01:10:00,340 --> 01:10:00,560
You know,

2684
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:02,420
this whole thing with him is so tragic.

2685
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:05,230
It's so tragic and you know,

2686
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:07,430
more tragic for the woman
he hit with his car.

2687
01:10:07,700 --> 01:10:10,390
But so tragic for him because you know,

2688
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:14,150
I don't know him well enough to know
like where his mind's at or who he's

2689
01:10:14,151 --> 01:10:15,060
talking to and you,

2690
01:10:15,061 --> 01:10:18,740
you hear all these bad things like the
people that he's hanging out with and the

2691
01:10:18,741 --> 01:10:19,980
people that he surrounds himself with.

2692
01:10:20,010 --> 01:10:20,271
You here,

2693
01:10:20,271 --> 01:10:21,500
some of them from his coaches.

2694
01:10:21,501 --> 01:10:23,690
So there's gotta be some
village and truth to it.

2695
01:10:23,691 --> 01:10:26,330
But for every guy like that,

2696
01:10:26,331 --> 01:10:28,340
that's super fucking talented,

2697
01:10:28,580 --> 01:10:31,640
it seems like it's so
hard to stay on track.

2698
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,500
It's like Mike Tyson had custom motto,

2699
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:35,660
you know,

2700
01:10:35,660 --> 01:10:38,360
and custom motto was not
just a great trainer,

2701
01:10:38,510 --> 01:10:41,210
but it was also a great mental coach.

2702
01:10:41,420 --> 01:10:46,420
Like he had instilled lessons in Mike
Tyson about fire and fear and all the,

2703
01:10:46,831 --> 01:10:51,260
all the different aspects of competition
that are going to arise and how the

2704
01:10:51,261 --> 01:10:53,390
hero and the coward feel the same thing.

2705
01:10:53,660 --> 01:10:55,490
It's just the hero
reacts to it differently.

2706
01:10:55,491 --> 01:10:58,550
And then just the more
you prepare your body,

2707
01:10:58,940 --> 01:10:59,773
the less,

2708
01:10:59,930 --> 01:11:00,763
the less,

2709
01:11:00,950 --> 01:11:01,701
not fear,

2710
01:11:01,701 --> 01:11:05,360
but the less confusion you have
when you get into that ring,

2711
01:11:05,540 --> 01:11:06,980
the less doubt you have,

2712
01:11:07,010 --> 01:11:07,670
the less,

2713
01:11:07,670 --> 01:11:09,050
the more clarity you have.

2714
01:11:09,051 --> 01:11:12,410
You're 100% confident and you're
conditioning your 100% confident in your

2715
01:11:12,411 --> 01:11:13,140
training.

2716
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:14,490
There will be certain

2717
01:11:14,490 --> 01:11:16,440
fear but you can mitigate some of that.

2718
01:11:16,441 --> 01:11:21,090
And all this was custom model just was
a genius with Tyson plus he was like a

2719
01:11:21,091 --> 01:11:21,751
father figure.

2720
01:11:21,751 --> 01:11:22,860
It was like a perfect example.

2721
01:11:22,890 --> 01:11:24,210
But Jon Jones had a father,

2722
01:11:24,610 --> 01:11:25,840
the father middle class.

2723
01:11:25,841 --> 01:11:26,690
I've still does.

2724
01:11:26,691 --> 01:11:27,570
You know he still does,

2725
01:11:27,571 --> 01:11:30,360
but what I'm saying is a coach you need,

2726
01:11:30,361 --> 01:11:33,900
you don't need that just in a father.

2727
01:11:33,930 --> 01:11:34,860
I mean his father,

2728
01:11:34,861 --> 01:11:36,920
does he have that out in Albuquerque with,

2729
01:11:36,950 --> 01:11:37,620
with uh,

2730
01:11:37,620 --> 01:11:38,453
Jackson?

2731
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:39,990
I think he does to a certain extent,

2732
01:11:40,260 --> 01:11:42,870
but Jon Jones is so fucking good.

2733
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:44,550
The guys who trained with him,

2734
01:11:44,551 --> 01:11:45,161
the guys who talk,

2735
01:11:45,161 --> 01:11:46,410
like if you talk to people you'll like,

2736
01:11:46,411 --> 01:11:47,610
he's so good.

2737
01:11:47,611 --> 01:11:50,100
He's so much better than
everybody else in the gym.

2738
01:11:50,490 --> 01:11:51,390
He's so much better than it.

2739
01:11:51,391 --> 01:11:51,570
I mean,

2740
01:11:51,570 --> 01:11:54,630
when you saw him grab a hold of Daniel
Cormier and wrestle Carme 80 the ground,

2741
01:11:54,631 --> 01:11:55,464
the first round,

2742
01:11:55,590 --> 01:11:55,921
he'll like,

2743
01:11:55,921 --> 01:11:56,370
listen,

2744
01:11:56,370 --> 01:11:59,730
this is another fucking level
shit you're dealing with.

2745
01:11:59,730 --> 01:12:01,890
You're dealing with like
another level of greatness.

2746
01:12:02,130 --> 01:12:05,070
Another level of ability and when you,

2747
01:12:05,210 --> 01:12:05,491
you know,

2748
01:12:05,491 --> 01:12:09,300
you see a guy like that get involved
and I mean the cocaine thing,

2749
01:12:09,301 --> 01:12:09,491
man,

2750
01:12:09,491 --> 01:12:10,710
that didn't bother me that much.

2751
01:12:10,711 --> 01:12:12,330
It's like it's always doing coke.

2752
01:12:12,331 --> 01:12:12,961
Three weeks out.

2753
01:12:12,961 --> 01:12:13,800
He's a bad motherfucker.

2754
01:12:13,801 --> 01:12:14,634
He wants a party,

2755
01:12:14,940 --> 01:12:15,181
you know?

2756
01:12:15,181 --> 01:12:16,080
That's how I look at it.

2757
01:12:16,081 --> 01:12:16,411
You know why?

2758
01:12:16,411 --> 01:12:17,120
Because I'm not,

2759
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:17,300
I'm,

2760
01:12:17,300 --> 01:12:17,550
I'm,

2761
01:12:17,550 --> 01:12:18,690
I don't look at this as like,

2762
01:12:19,140 --> 01:12:19,501
no,

2763
01:12:19,501 --> 01:12:20,141
I don't have any cure.

2764
01:12:20,141 --> 01:12:21,200
A 10 don't know me.

2765
01:12:21,210 --> 01:12:21,811
She's like,

2766
01:12:21,811 --> 01:12:21,980
Hey,

2767
01:12:21,980 --> 01:12:22,621
let's have fun.

2768
01:12:22,621 --> 01:12:24,270
What would I get upset if he had a drink?

2769
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:25,230
Three you know,

2770
01:12:25,231 --> 01:12:25,950
three months out.

2771
01:12:25,950 --> 01:12:26,311
No.

2772
01:12:26,311 --> 01:12:26,611
So,

2773
01:12:26,611 --> 01:12:27,670
or three weeks out or whether,

2774
01:12:28,110 --> 01:12:28,980
how many weeks was it?

2775
01:12:29,130 --> 01:12:30,770
How many weeks was it
before the fight about that?

2776
01:12:30,780 --> 01:12:31,170
It sounds right.

2777
01:12:31,170 --> 01:12:31,891
Four or five weeks.

2778
01:12:31,891 --> 01:12:32,724
I don't know it was,

2779
01:12:32,970 --> 01:12:35,410
but what I could get mad if he had a beer.

2780
01:12:35,410 --> 01:12:38,800
Donald Cerrone drinks Budweiser up until
the fucking week of his weight cut.

2781
01:12:38,850 --> 01:12:39,840
That's a fact.

2782
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:41,370
And he doesn't just drink a little,

2783
01:12:41,371 --> 01:12:42,204
he drinks a lot.

2784
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:43,230
What's worse for you?

2785
01:12:43,231 --> 01:12:44,340
Alcohol or cocaine?

2786
01:12:44,430 --> 01:12:44,581
Well,

2787
01:12:44,581 --> 01:12:45,870
I don't know how much John was doing,

2788
01:12:45,871 --> 01:12:49,110
but a little line here and there is
probably not as bad as the amount of

2789
01:12:49,111 --> 01:12:50,730
Budweiser that Donald socks down.

2790
01:12:50,731 --> 01:12:51,390
That's true.

2791
01:12:51,390 --> 01:12:51,930
That's true.

2792
01:12:51,930 --> 01:12:52,141
I mean,

2793
01:12:52,141 --> 01:12:53,460
I don't fucking know man.

2794
01:12:53,490 --> 01:12:54,300
I don't know.

2795
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:58,500
I think part of the issue that people
have with a guy like John who's just so

2796
01:12:58,530 --> 01:13:01,380
Uber talented and he's so young
and all these things come handy,

2797
01:13:01,381 --> 01:13:02,210
Tammy said,

2798
01:13:02,210 --> 01:13:02,320
oh,

2799
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:03,300
just come so,

2800
01:13:03,590 --> 01:13:08,590
so easy to him is that when a guy like
that professors to be like very moral and

2801
01:13:10,330 --> 01:13:10,650
you know,

2802
01:13:10,650 --> 01:13:14,760
very religious and then you see all
this craziness like tested positive for

2803
01:13:14,761 --> 01:13:17,310
cocaine and the drunk
driving crash into a tree,

2804
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:18,420
which strippers in his car.

2805
01:13:18,420 --> 01:13:18,691
It's like,

2806
01:13:18,691 --> 01:13:19,230
yeah,

2807
01:13:19,230 --> 01:13:20,880
clearly he likes to have fun,

2808
01:13:20,940 --> 01:13:21,720
you know,

2809
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:23,610
and there's another wrong with that.

2810
01:13:23,670 --> 01:13:24,400
Nothing wrong at all.

2811
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:28,230
It's in part of his dumb or
the drill dumb about it though,

2812
01:13:28,231 --> 01:13:28,450
you know,

2813
01:13:28,450 --> 01:13:29,580
so really party.

2814
01:13:29,581 --> 01:13:30,330
But uh,

2815
01:13:30,330 --> 01:13:32,310
it could be that nobody can control.

2816
01:13:32,350 --> 01:13:32,491
I mean,

2817
01:13:32,491 --> 01:13:33,181
it's also like when you're,

2818
01:13:33,181 --> 01:13:34,260
that guy came good.

2819
01:13:34,261 --> 01:13:35,400
You don't want to listen to anybody,

2820
01:13:36,210 --> 01:13:36,540
you know,

2821
01:13:36,540 --> 01:13:37,460
you're the fucking man.

2822
01:13:37,530 --> 01:13:40,710
Tons of guys in the UFC and other
sports who keep it together.

2823
01:13:41,090 --> 01:13:41,730
You know,

2824
01:13:41,730 --> 01:13:43,320
George St Pierre was awesome.

2825
01:13:43,650 --> 01:13:44,820
He was very disciplined.

2826
01:13:44,830 --> 01:13:45,150
You know,

2827
01:13:45,150 --> 01:13:47,130
the still a template together,

2828
01:13:47,190 --> 01:13:48,150
which fucked up too.

2829
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:49,920
Like George totally underestimated.

2830
01:13:49,921 --> 01:13:51,810
Matt Serra totally underestimated.

2831
01:13:51,811 --> 01:13:56,140
Matt Serra got in there with him
and got crushed and that's just you.

2832
01:13:56,190 --> 01:13:59,940
You got to dot your i's
and cross your t's all day,

2833
01:13:59,941 --> 01:14:00,774
every day.

2834
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:02,580
You can't take anyone lightly.

2835
01:14:02,581 --> 01:14:02,910
And we've,

2836
01:14:02,910 --> 01:14:07,080
I've seen that many times where guys
were way favored over their opponent,

2837
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:10,380
but they took it lightly because they
were favorite and their opponent was

2838
01:14:10,381 --> 01:14:12,310
terrified because they were the underdog.

2839
01:14:12,430 --> 01:14:15,410
So they train like a demon and the other
guy's slacked off and went in there

2840
01:14:15,411 --> 01:14:17,980
with a false sense of confidence and also,

2841
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:18,910
uh,

2842
01:14:18,910 --> 01:14:20,710
minimize sense of danger.

2843
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:22,930
Like nobody likes that fucking feeling,

2844
01:14:22,931 --> 01:14:23,231
man.

2845
01:14:23,231 --> 01:14:24,130
You and you went through it,

2846
01:14:24,131 --> 01:14:24,341
right?

2847
01:14:24,341 --> 01:14:24,580
Yeah.

2848
01:14:24,580 --> 01:14:26,090
That feeling of being in the locker room,

2849
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:26,500
you're like,

2850
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:27,150
ah,

2851
01:14:27,150 --> 01:14:28,060
gluttonous is over.

2852
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:30,070
I'll get me out there.

2853
01:14:30,850 --> 01:14:31,810
When I stopped competing,

2854
01:14:31,811 --> 01:14:33,520
there was the one thing
that I appreciated the most.

2855
01:14:33,521 --> 01:14:36,850
Like I didn't have to feel
like I was always scared.

2856
01:14:37,190 --> 01:14:37,341
Yeah.

2857
01:14:37,341 --> 01:14:38,330
I was always like,

2858
01:14:38,331 --> 01:14:40,070
we're waiting for the next fight.

2859
01:14:40,370 --> 01:14:40,611
You know,

2860
01:14:40,611 --> 01:14:40,751
the,

2861
01:14:40,751 --> 01:14:41,231
the book,

2862
01:14:41,231 --> 01:14:41,770
uh,

2863
01:14:41,770 --> 01:14:42,500
the book is,

2864
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:44,060
I say it's about the dual,

2865
01:14:44,150 --> 01:14:44,631
the dual,

2866
01:14:44,631 --> 01:14:44,950
you know,

2867
01:14:44,950 --> 01:14:45,890
the pistols at dawn.

2868
01:14:46,130 --> 01:14:47,090
Broadly defined,

2869
01:14:47,110 --> 01:14:47,430
Sorta,

2870
01:14:47,430 --> 01:14:50,080
Sorta Mano on keep that actually.

2871
01:14:50,750 --> 01:14:51,021
Thank you.

2872
01:14:51,021 --> 01:14:52,270
I still owe money on my face on it.

2873
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:54,020
Think about me when you get your coffee.

2874
01:14:54,050 --> 01:14:54,883
That's great man.

2875
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:56,660
You're pretty keen on that thing.

2876
01:14:56,661 --> 01:14:57,481
I already think about Q,

2877
01:14:57,481 --> 01:14:58,400
I drink my coffee.

2878
01:14:58,960 --> 01:14:59,600
Um,

2879
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:00,081
but you know,

2880
01:15:00,081 --> 01:15:02,170
I sort of thought about
Mano a Mano conflict of,

2881
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:02,521
of,

2882
01:15:02,521 --> 01:15:04,920
of various kinds and uh,

2883
01:15:05,020 --> 01:15:05,300
you know,

2884
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:08,290
so an MMA fight or any kind
of combat sport fights,

2885
01:15:08,300 --> 01:15:09,133
kind of a dual,

2886
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:12,050
set it up in advance.

2887
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:12,540
You know,

2888
01:15:12,540 --> 01:15:16,880
you have seconds who negotiate for you
work your corner and all that stuff and

2889
01:15:16,881 --> 01:15:17,714
you know,

2890
01:15:17,750 --> 01:15:18,411
weeks out,

2891
01:15:18,411 --> 01:15:18,950
months out,

2892
01:15:18,950 --> 01:15:23,950
even you even longer that you're going
to be in a car crash at such and such a

2893
01:15:24,081 --> 01:15:24,501
time,

2894
01:15:24,501 --> 01:15:25,100
you know,

2895
01:15:25,100 --> 01:15:26,270
and it weighs on you,

2896
01:15:26,330 --> 01:15:26,601
you know,

2897
01:15:26,601 --> 01:15:27,890
weighs on you so heavy.

2898
01:15:28,270 --> 01:15:29,103
Um,

2899
01:15:29,270 --> 01:15:29,811
whereas,

2900
01:15:29,811 --> 01:15:29,991
you know,

2901
01:15:29,991 --> 01:15:33,410
if you were to walk out in the parking
lot right now and some guy picked a fight

2902
01:15:33,411 --> 01:15:35,480
with you that be bad,

2903
01:15:35,481 --> 01:15:35,801
but it wouldn't,

2904
01:15:35,801 --> 01:15:38,810
you wouldn't have the same kind of fear
and anxiety that the buildup to it.

2905
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:39,740
So yeah,

2906
01:15:39,741 --> 01:15:41,360
I was glad to get that out of my life.

2907
01:15:41,410 --> 01:15:41,810
Uh,

2908
01:15:41,810 --> 01:15:42,381
because I had,

2909
01:15:42,381 --> 01:15:44,900
I looked at that for a long time because
it took me a long time to get a fight

2910
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:48,950
to me in a long time because I was old
and state commission makes it pretty hard

2911
01:15:48,951 --> 01:15:50,240
for older fighters to,

2912
01:15:50,290 --> 01:15:50,530
to,

2913
01:15:50,530 --> 01:15:52,670
to allow a certain match up in fights,

2914
01:15:52,671 --> 01:15:56,710
kept calling through or somebody would
not show up or I would get hurt or that

2915
01:15:56,711 --> 01:15:56,871
guy,

2916
01:15:56,871 --> 01:15:57,441
we get hurt.

2917
01:15:57,441 --> 01:16:01,550
And so I live with that sense that the
fight was right around the corner for

2918
01:16:01,551 --> 01:16:02,600
maybe six months.

2919
01:16:02,630 --> 01:16:03,590
Did fuck with your sleep?

2920
01:16:03,980 --> 01:16:04,161
Oh,

2921
01:16:04,161 --> 01:16:04,730
everything.

2922
01:16:04,730 --> 01:16:04,911
Yeah.

2923
01:16:04,911 --> 01:16:05,810
I just lived in,

2924
01:16:05,870 --> 01:16:10,490
I lived with his mild sense of anxiety
punctuated by these stabs of terror,

2925
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:11,480
you know what I mean?

2926
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:14,120
And that's when I would start
negotiating with myself saying to myself,

2927
01:16:14,300 --> 01:16:14,481
you know,

2928
01:16:14,481 --> 01:16:15,880
other writers have done this before,

2929
01:16:15,930 --> 01:16:16,461
what the hell?

2930
01:16:16,461 --> 01:16:16,640
What's,

2931
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:17,480
what's the point of this?

2932
01:16:17,481 --> 01:16:17,751
There's no,

2933
01:16:17,751 --> 01:16:19,010
there's no point in actually fighting,

2934
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:19,431
you know,

2935
01:16:19,431 --> 01:16:19,731
you can,

2936
01:16:19,731 --> 01:16:20,221
you can train it,

2937
01:16:20,221 --> 01:16:20,481
the gym,

2938
01:16:20,481 --> 01:16:21,141
you can do a lot of stuff.

2939
01:16:21,141 --> 01:16:22,850
There's no point in actually having a,

2940
01:16:22,910 --> 01:16:24,260
the actual fight as well.

2941
01:16:24,440 --> 01:16:26,810
I was glad to get that out of the way
and I was glad to get out of the weight

2942
01:16:26,811 --> 01:16:29,210
management because that was
the other hard thing about it.

2943
01:16:29,211 --> 01:16:30,050
So for those six months,

2944
01:16:30,051 --> 01:16:31,860
I was staying at a very uh,

2945
01:16:32,030 --> 01:16:32,690
low way.

2946
01:16:32,690 --> 01:16:34,220
What were you trying to weigh in at?

2947
01:16:34,900 --> 01:16:35,090
Well,

2948
01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:37,260
I started the project
and close to 200 pounds.

2949
01:16:37,390 --> 01:16:38,230
I was heavier,

2950
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:38,870
uh,

2951
01:16:38,870 --> 01:16:39,590
kind of fat.

2952
01:16:39,590 --> 01:16:40,423
Um,

2953
01:16:40,550 --> 01:16:41,510
and uh,

2954
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:42,180
and then I,

2955
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:43,013
you know,

2956
01:16:43,190 --> 01:16:44,570
so like if I want 85,

2957
01:16:44,571 --> 01:16:45,830
I could fight at two oh five,

2958
01:16:45,870 --> 01:16:46,041
you know,

2959
01:16:46,041 --> 01:16:48,380
bulk up and quite the huge guys.

2960
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:49,273
Um,

2961
01:16:49,430 --> 01:16:49,581
uh,

2962
01:16:49,581 --> 01:16:50,251
by decided to fight,

2963
01:16:50,251 --> 01:16:52,160
I'll win all the way down to one 70.

2964
01:16:52,470 --> 01:16:53,020
Um,

2965
01:16:53,020 --> 01:16:56,090
and so I cut down to where I
was walking around like one 80.

2966
01:16:56,120 --> 01:16:57,790
Cause at the amateurs you don't have 24,

2967
01:16:57,800 --> 01:16:58,401
30 hours,

2968
01:16:58,401 --> 01:16:58,790
whatever,

2969
01:16:58,790 --> 01:17:00,050
whatever it is to rehydrate.

2970
01:17:00,051 --> 01:17:00,884
How much do you have?

2971
01:17:01,430 --> 01:17:01,970
Uh,

2972
01:17:01,970 --> 01:17:06,140
we weighed in like a 10
o'clock in the morning for a,

2973
01:17:06,290 --> 01:17:07,040
for a fight.

2974
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:07,431
Fights.

2975
01:17:07,431 --> 01:17:09,450
It started at seven that day.

2976
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:09,980
Yeah.

2977
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:10,461
Whoa,

2978
01:17:10,461 --> 01:17:11,360
that's dangerous.

2979
01:17:11,361 --> 01:17:12,194
Yeah.

2980
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:13,130
People don't cut a lot of weight,

2981
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:13,791
so I kinda like,

2982
01:17:13,791 --> 01:17:14,624
should you cut?

2983
01:17:14,660 --> 01:17:15,230
Uh,

2984
01:17:15,230 --> 01:17:15,800
I started,

2985
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:18,950
I started cutting like the week of
like bit starving myself and mild

2986
01:17:18,951 --> 01:17:19,940
dehydration.

2987
01:17:20,020 --> 01:17:20,450
Um,

2988
01:17:20,450 --> 01:17:21,240
and by the time,

2989
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:22,460
by like the night before my fight,

2990
01:17:22,461 --> 01:17:23,750
I was like one 76,

2991
01:17:23,751 --> 01:17:24,201
I think.

2992
01:17:24,201 --> 01:17:26,210
And then I got up in the
morning and sweated it all out.

2993
01:17:26,750 --> 01:17:28,210
So you sweat out six pounds,

2994
01:17:28,530 --> 01:17:28,890
uh,

2995
01:17:28,890 --> 01:17:29,300
for,

2996
01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:30,270
I've actually overdid it.

2997
01:17:30,271 --> 01:17:32,180
I kind of screwed up because
I didn't have a scale.

2998
01:17:32,181 --> 01:17:34,270
I had no idea how much I
was actually sweating down.

2999
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:35,271
Well,

3000
01:17:35,271 --> 01:17:35,920
I had a scale way.

3001
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:39,080
You have no idea how you cut weight
and then fought the same day.

3002
01:17:39,081 --> 01:17:40,640
That's illegal in most places.

3003
01:17:41,300 --> 01:17:41,661
Again,

3004
01:17:41,661 --> 01:17:42,610
how are they going to know,

3005
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:43,200
you know?

3006
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:43,560
Well,

3007
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:44,510
you get to know,

3008
01:17:44,630 --> 01:17:45,830
did you rehydrate?

3009
01:17:46,190 --> 01:17:46,641
Oh yeah.

3010
01:17:46,641 --> 01:17:47,570
I know I was.

3011
01:17:47,571 --> 01:17:49,910
I was at one 68.5 at Wingham,

3012
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:53,030
so I actually lost like seven pounds
that morning or seven and a half pounds.

3013
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:54,230
And then,

3014
01:17:54,230 --> 01:17:55,063
um,

3015
01:17:55,370 --> 01:17:56,180
and then I just,

3016
01:17:56,180 --> 01:17:57,650
well no ivs.

3017
01:17:57,740 --> 01:17:58,190
No,

3018
01:17:58,190 --> 01:17:58,461
no,

3019
01:17:58,461 --> 01:17:58,641
no.

3020
01:17:58,641 --> 01:17:58,881
I didn't.

3021
01:17:58,881 --> 01:17:59,120
No,

3022
01:17:59,120 --> 01:17:59,420
I don't.

3023
01:17:59,420 --> 01:18:00,180
I don't know.

3024
01:18:00,180 --> 01:18:01,840
I wasn't doing a scientific way co,

3025
01:18:01,870 --> 01:18:02,060
you know,

3026
01:18:02,060 --> 01:18:03,260
I mean you're a smart guy.

3027
01:18:03,290 --> 01:18:03,501
Yeah.

3028
01:18:03,501 --> 01:18:04,191
But I'd read up on it,

3029
01:18:04,191 --> 01:18:04,791
but I didn't know how,

3030
01:18:04,791 --> 01:18:08,300
how would I get a guy to give me an
idea how to talk to a fucking doctor.

3031
01:18:09,260 --> 01:18:12,230
You went through all this preparation
and didn't prepare enough to find a

3032
01:18:12,231 --> 01:18:12,621
doctor.

3033
01:18:12,621 --> 01:18:12,880
Yeah.

3034
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:13,521
Nivea drip.

3035
01:18:13,521 --> 01:18:14,354
It's just water.

3036
01:18:14,540 --> 01:18:15,980
It's nothing unethical about it.

3037
01:18:16,010 --> 01:18:16,311
Yeah,

3038
01:18:16,311 --> 01:18:17,300
we'll do it when you're demeaning.

3039
01:18:17,301 --> 01:18:17,690
Treat it.

3040
01:18:17,690 --> 01:18:20,120
That does not appear to be the culture of,

3041
01:18:20,150 --> 01:18:20,690
of,

3042
01:18:20,690 --> 01:18:21,523
of the,

3043
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:23,660
of the MMA world that I was moving in.

3044
01:18:24,170 --> 01:18:24,650
I don't mean,

3045
01:18:24,650 --> 01:18:26,150
I don't know the guys were getting ivs,

3046
01:18:26,330 --> 01:18:27,200
but they're crazy.

3047
01:18:27,201 --> 01:18:29,150
If they're not cutting weight,

3048
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:30,260
you should get an ivy.

3049
01:18:30,290 --> 01:18:33,910
I still put every pound of
those six pounds back on by,

3050
01:18:34,070 --> 01:18:34,881
by the time the fight give,

3051
01:18:34,881 --> 01:18:35,110
you know,

3052
01:18:35,110 --> 01:18:37,460
the issue's not putting the water back on.

3053
01:18:37,460 --> 01:18:38,960
It's getting the water in your brain.

3054
01:18:38,990 --> 01:18:39,560
Yeah,

3055
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:40,520
that's the real issue.

3056
01:18:40,521 --> 01:18:42,950
All of the more significant deaths,

3057
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:43,911
brain damage,

3058
01:18:43,911 --> 01:18:45,860
all the big issues and boxing,

3059
01:18:46,250 --> 01:18:50,330
almost all of them up to like it
except for a few isolated events,

3060
01:18:50,660 --> 01:18:52,160
which were horrible beatings,

3061
01:18:52,161 --> 01:18:54,410
which is why I think Eric
Perez was involved in one.

3062
01:18:54,620 --> 01:18:55,670
Is it Eric Perez?

3063
01:18:56,300 --> 01:18:56,850
Heavyweight?

3064
01:18:56,850 --> 01:19:00,140
I was involved in some horrible beating
of this Russian guy and that guy

3065
01:19:00,141 --> 01:19:01,970
suffered some pretty
significant brain damage,

3066
01:19:01,971 --> 01:19:03,040
which is a heavyweight belt,

3067
01:19:03,041 --> 01:19:04,250
which is very rare.

3068
01:19:04,370 --> 01:19:05,203
It's usually little guys.

3069
01:19:05,630 --> 01:19:07,460
It's usually the people that cut weight.

3070
01:19:07,820 --> 01:19:09,380
It's usually the people that cut weight,

3071
01:19:09,381 --> 01:19:10,940
the duck Ku Kim's and yeah,

3072
01:19:11,180 --> 01:19:15,920
I mean that's one of the fights where
they made the way in the day before the

3073
01:19:15,921 --> 01:19:16,311
fight.

3074
01:19:16,311 --> 01:19:18,490
They changed it after that fight.

3075
01:19:18,510 --> 01:19:21,620
They also change it from 15 rounds
to 12 rounds because you know,

3076
01:19:21,621 --> 01:19:22,640
people were realizing like,

3077
01:19:22,641 --> 01:19:23,210
hey man,

3078
01:19:23,210 --> 01:19:25,070
like this is fucking dangerous.

3079
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:26,330
Losing all this weight.

3080
01:19:26,331 --> 01:19:27,950
You dehydrate your actual brain,

3081
01:19:27,951 --> 01:19:30,620
you make yourself more susceptible
to brain trauma and bleeding.

3082
01:19:30,720 --> 01:19:31,360
Yeah,

3083
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:32,250
Gerald Mcclellan.

3084
01:19:32,251 --> 01:19:36,410
So and other one was a notoriously huge
guy would cut a tremendous amount of

3085
01:19:36,411 --> 01:19:37,101
weight to get down.

3086
01:19:37,101 --> 01:19:42,060
I think he's fighting at one 75
the one 75 one 68 I forget what,

3087
01:19:42,090 --> 01:19:42,771
what he fought at,

3088
01:19:42,771 --> 01:19:45,500
but Gerald cut a tremendous
amount of weight,

3089
01:19:45,740 --> 01:19:46,281
got down,

3090
01:19:46,281 --> 01:19:47,600
fought Nigel Benn and,

3091
01:19:47,601 --> 01:19:49,140
and had like a,

3092
01:19:49,640 --> 01:19:50,473
he was,

3093
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:54,740
he was bleeding inside the octagon
like or inside the ring rather.

3094
01:19:54,950 --> 01:19:55,860
He had a,

3095
01:19:55,880 --> 01:19:59,780
an episode where he like had
a stroke inside the ring.

3096
01:19:59,781 --> 01:20:03,440
Like in the middle of his fight he had
to take a knee and then just quit and

3097
01:20:03,441 --> 01:20:04,850
realized something was way wrong.

3098
01:20:05,270 --> 01:20:06,140
And people like that can't,

3099
01:20:06,141 --> 01:20:08,880
I can't believe he quit and he
collapsed in his corner and you know,

3100
01:20:09,210 --> 01:20:10,080
the rest is history.

3101
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:11,370
He's all fucked up now.

3102
01:20:11,910 --> 01:20:13,890
And if you went back to the day,

3103
01:20:14,250 --> 01:20:15,930
if you ever watched that guy fight,

3104
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:18,090
you've ever see Gerald Mcclellan
fight like back in the day?

3105
01:20:19,530 --> 01:20:19,681
Well,

3106
01:20:19,681 --> 01:20:24,681
he was a terrifying fighter and the big
show down was always going to be him and

3107
01:20:25,171 --> 01:20:27,660
Roy Jones jr that's what
everybody was thinking.

3108
01:20:27,661 --> 01:20:28,441
Like one day,

3109
01:20:28,441 --> 01:20:30,240
him and Roy Jones Jr going to throw down.

3110
01:20:30,270 --> 01:20:32,490
Gerald McClellan was fucking killer.

3111
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:33,480
He was a killer.

3112
01:20:34,050 --> 01:20:37,080
But he fought Nigel Benn and
Nigel band was just tough as shit.

3113
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:41,340
And they went to war and Gerald
had them all but knocked out,

3114
01:20:41,341 --> 01:20:42,690
had them knocked out of the ring,

3115
01:20:42,691 --> 01:20:44,010
like you went through the ring,

3116
01:20:44,250 --> 01:20:45,380
got back into the ring,

3117
01:20:45,390 --> 01:20:45,880
got back.

3118
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:47,400
But just nodule ban would not quit.

3119
01:20:47,790 --> 01:20:51,900
And there was a period in the fight
somewhere where they collided heads.

3120
01:20:52,230 --> 01:20:54,360
And that was one of the big
ones mean Nigel definitely land.

3121
01:20:54,361 --> 01:20:55,410
It's a big punches on them,

3122
01:20:55,680 --> 01:20:58,460
but they collided heads and you
could tell like after the head,

3123
01:20:58,461 --> 01:21:02,190
but like he was all fucking
woozy and whacked out and then,

3124
01:21:02,220 --> 01:21:02,460
you know,

3125
01:21:02,460 --> 01:21:04,110
he had to take a knee
and then it was over.

3126
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:05,070
And he's,

3127
01:21:05,070 --> 01:21:06,750
he's blind now.

3128
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:08,130
I think he can't hear,

3129
01:21:08,490 --> 01:21:09,420
he can't move.

3130
01:21:09,930 --> 01:21:12,240
He's all fucked up and it's
all just from brain bleeding.

3131
01:21:12,570 --> 01:21:13,111
So it's,

3132
01:21:13,111 --> 01:21:14,400
it's a real issue.

3133
01:21:14,401 --> 01:21:16,410
The dehydration issues are real issue.

3134
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:17,451
Yeah.

3135
01:21:17,451 --> 01:21:18,050
And you said,

3136
01:21:18,050 --> 01:21:18,470
you know,

3137
01:21:18,470 --> 01:21:19,310
earlier on you said,

3138
01:21:19,311 --> 01:21:19,880
you know,

3139
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:20,810
how do you stop it?

3140
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:21,530
And I think it,

3141
01:21:21,530 --> 01:21:22,640
I think it is one of those things,

3142
01:21:22,641 --> 01:21:23,061
it's really,

3143
01:21:23,061 --> 01:21:24,700
really hard to stop because you know,

3144
01:21:24,710 --> 01:21:26,030
as you've talked about on the show,

3145
01:21:26,240 --> 01:21:29,360
any kind of a new measure you set up,

3146
01:21:29,390 --> 01:21:30,171
there's a way to beat it.

3147
01:21:30,171 --> 01:21:30,910
There's a way,

3148
01:21:30,910 --> 01:21:32,690
there's still going to be a cutting way.

3149
01:21:32,990 --> 01:21:35,210
I think amateur wrestling
has dealt with this,

3150
01:21:35,480 --> 01:21:36,620
a little kits,

3151
01:21:36,810 --> 01:21:37,280
um,

3152
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:40,250
by body fat percentages of
things or maybe hydration,

3153
01:21:40,450 --> 01:21:40,850
uh,

3154
01:21:40,850 --> 01:21:41,421
measurements.

3155
01:21:41,421 --> 01:21:45,540
Like you can measure how much
a hydration there they haven't.

3156
01:21:45,570 --> 01:21:49,100
So you can tell when the kid is
cutting weight through dehydration.

3157
01:21:49,210 --> 01:21:49,410
Right?

3158
01:21:49,410 --> 01:21:51,130
I'm not sure if that will be possible to,

3159
01:21:51,490 --> 01:21:54,320
to measure hydration levels
and that might be one way to,

3160
01:21:54,321 --> 01:21:55,154
to deal with it.

3161
01:21:55,250 --> 01:21:56,083
But,

3162
01:21:56,150 --> 01:21:56,421
but I,

3163
01:21:56,421 --> 01:21:56,991
but I agree with you.

3164
01:21:56,991 --> 01:21:58,010
That one's a hard one to fix.

3165
01:21:58,011 --> 01:21:59,420
That's why I keep going
back to the gloves.

3166
01:21:59,480 --> 01:22:00,590
I'm obsessed with the gloves things.

3167
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:01,040
Right.

3168
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:03,260
Right now we use those test
with them for a good reason.

3169
01:22:03,261 --> 01:22:03,590
Why?

3170
01:22:03,590 --> 01:22:05,240
I mean if you agree on this,

3171
01:22:05,241 --> 01:22:06,140
after all your study,

3172
01:22:06,141 --> 01:22:07,700
after all these years,

3173
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:08,540
um,

3174
01:22:08,540 --> 01:22:09,380
and I agree on it,

3175
01:22:09,381 --> 01:22:09,830
why isn't,

3176
01:22:09,830 --> 01:22:10,131
why didn't,

3177
01:22:10,131 --> 01:22:12,110
why do you think it's not a happening?

3178
01:22:12,230 --> 01:22:14,120
Cause it's incredibly hard to change.

3179
01:22:14,121 --> 01:22:14,650
Once

3180
01:22:14,650 --> 01:22:19,120
these commissions have these rules
and regulations in pray in place,

3181
01:22:19,121 --> 01:22:20,470
they're very difficult to change.

3182
01:22:20,471 --> 01:22:21,430
Once they're established,

3183
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:22,660
they're insanely difficult

3184
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:23,070
change.

3185
01:22:23,070 --> 01:22:26,050
I think there's a policy
would be against it or for it.

3186
01:22:26,290 --> 01:22:28,960
The USC probably would be against it

3187
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:30,600
in the current state.

3188
01:22:30,630 --> 01:22:30,901
I mean,

3189
01:22:30,901 --> 01:22:32,220
even if they listened to me,

3190
01:22:32,460 --> 01:22:34,010
they rationalize like,

3191
01:22:34,020 --> 01:22:34,211
wow,

3192
01:22:34,211 --> 01:22:35,100
you got some good points.

3193
01:22:35,130 --> 01:22:39,060
And then there would be all but bubble
blow we can't because blah blah blah over

3194
01:22:39,061 --> 01:22:39,840
the Bubba bubby,

3195
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:40,141
uh,

3196
01:22:40,141 --> 01:22:40,921
well first of all,

3197
01:22:40,921 --> 01:22:42,690
people would think it's barbaric.

3198
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:44,670
So the public perception,

3199
01:22:45,180 --> 01:22:46,170
public perception,

3200
01:22:46,210 --> 01:22:46,470
uh,

3201
01:22:46,470 --> 01:22:47,430
more cuts,

3202
01:22:47,460 --> 01:22:48,720
which is probably true,

3203
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,610
probably a lot more cuts from knuckles.

3204
01:22:51,150 --> 01:22:54,970
Knuckles were hand injuries in first and
much more hand until the shorter hours,

3205
01:22:54,990 --> 01:22:55,980
shorter careers.

3206
01:22:56,430 --> 01:22:57,420
You would shorten your careers.

3207
01:22:57,421 --> 01:22:57,631
I mean,

3208
01:22:57,631 --> 01:23:00,570
there's certain guys that have had
like significant head injuries.

3209
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:04,470
One of the reasons why when you see Vitor
Belfort throw all these kicks recently

3210
01:23:04,700 --> 01:23:05,221
because his hands,

3211
01:23:05,221 --> 01:23:06,340
her hands had been broken

3212
01:23:06,340 --> 01:23:07,450
seven fucking times.

3213
01:23:07,451 --> 01:23:08,680
He's said seven injuries,

3214
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:10,510
a seven surgeries rather.

3215
01:23:10,810 --> 01:23:11,440
I think my,

3216
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:12,273
my uh,

3217
01:23:12,730 --> 01:23:14,530
I think the major obstacle to it,

3218
01:23:14,640 --> 01:23:14,921
if you,

3219
01:23:14,921 --> 01:23:19,180
if you thought it all through the major
obstacle to it would be the upside of

3220
01:23:19,181 --> 01:23:21,430
this is it would be a lot
less neurological damage.

3221
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:27,070
The downside to it would be there'd be
a lot less neurological damage and be a

3222
01:23:27,071 --> 01:23:28,210
lot fewer knockouts.

3223
01:23:28,510 --> 01:23:29,230
Um,

3224
01:23:29,230 --> 01:23:31,510
there'd be a lot less heavy,

3225
01:23:31,570 --> 01:23:32,050
uh,

3226
01:23:32,050 --> 01:23:32,380
you know,

3227
01:23:32,380 --> 01:23:34,120
the barrages of heavy punches.

3228
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:34,700
Um,

3229
01:23:34,700 --> 01:23:35,710
and they'd have to change their,

3230
01:23:35,711 --> 01:23:35,921
their,

3231
01:23:35,921 --> 01:23:36,131
their,

3232
01:23:36,131 --> 01:23:37,420
their repertoire of punches.

3233
01:23:37,421 --> 01:23:41,080
He had to go back towards the bare
knuckle style style of punching a much,

3234
01:23:41,170 --> 01:23:41,800
much,

3235
01:23:41,800 --> 01:23:43,210
much more straight punches,

3236
01:23:43,470 --> 01:23:43,870
uh,

3237
01:23:43,870 --> 01:23:46,790
trying to throw punches into the fleshy
part of the face that you're throwing up

3238
01:23:47,020 --> 01:23:48,070
with more control,

3239
01:23:48,310 --> 01:23:52,330
many more punches to the padded torso
using these two knuckles as well,

3240
01:23:52,331 --> 01:23:53,740
using the front two knuckles.

3241
01:23:54,120 --> 01:23:54,370
Oh,

3242
01:23:54,370 --> 01:23:55,060
in traditional,

3243
01:23:55,060 --> 01:23:58,870
she read a bare knuckle
boxing book and you know,

3244
01:23:59,050 --> 01:24:02,860
they go back to the techniques of
how it was done back then and they,

3245
01:24:02,870 --> 01:24:03,940
they're not giving that to the,

3246
01:24:03,941 --> 01:24:04,620
to knuckle things would,

3247
01:24:04,620 --> 01:24:04,870
would,

3248
01:24:04,870 --> 01:24:05,703
I always learned to,

3249
01:24:05,710 --> 01:24:07,690
that's a boxer's teach
what martial artists teach.

3250
01:24:08,140 --> 01:24:08,320
Uh,

3251
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:08,621
their,

3252
01:24:08,621 --> 01:24:08,980
their,

3253
01:24:08,980 --> 01:24:10,990
their thing and it makes some sense.

3254
01:24:11,140 --> 01:24:13,900
They're saying this is a surface,

3255
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:17,980
you turn it that way so
you have more surface area.

3256
01:24:18,670 --> 01:24:19,420
So you're not screaming,

3257
01:24:19,420 --> 01:24:20,890
you're not putting so much damage here.

3258
01:24:20,891 --> 01:24:21,560
And you say,

3259
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:22,520
I've heard people say,

3260
01:24:22,521 --> 01:24:22,691
you know,

3261
01:24:22,691 --> 01:24:23,650
you're in alignment there,

3262
01:24:23,770 --> 01:24:25,330
but you're kind of also
an alignment there.

3263
01:24:25,331 --> 01:24:26,350
That's not so bad either.

3264
01:24:27,460 --> 01:24:27,641
Well,

3265
01:24:27,641 --> 01:24:31,240
the real issue is to write
the bare knuckle boxing.

3266
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:33,240
What you're saying is they
would throw it perpendicular.

3267
01:24:33,241 --> 01:24:33,790
Yeah.

3268
01:24:33,790 --> 01:24:35,970
Instead of parallel with the ground throw,

3269
01:24:35,990 --> 01:24:38,080
throw a perpendicular punch into a boxing,

3270
01:24:38,170 --> 01:24:38,351
uh,

3271
01:24:38,351 --> 01:24:40,210
until heavy bag and
see what it feels like.

3272
01:24:40,210 --> 01:24:41,190
And you don't get as much power,

3273
01:24:41,610 --> 01:24:42,670
not nearly as much power.

3274
01:24:43,630 --> 01:24:46,690
And it's designed to be that way
because if you throw us out of the hands

3275
01:24:47,020 --> 01:24:49,450
because your fist will
just explode on contact.

3276
01:24:49,510 --> 01:24:50,320
Yeah.

3277
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:51,790
Some people wouldn't
have any problem with it.

3278
01:24:51,820 --> 01:24:56,470
Some people would like big giant hands
like Brock Lesnar hands or Shane car when

3279
01:24:56,471 --> 01:24:56,771
hands,

3280
01:24:56,771 --> 01:24:59,050
those guys probably wouldn't
have nearly as much problem.

3281
01:24:59,470 --> 01:25:04,150
But if you can go back to the old UFC and
you see when guys fought bare knuckle,

3282
01:25:04,151 --> 01:25:07,330
you've very rarely saw like
blistering combinations.

3283
01:25:07,331 --> 01:25:09,160
Like you'll see like a
guy like [inaudible],

3284
01:25:09,540 --> 01:25:11,170
you know barrages of punches.

3285
01:25:11,470 --> 01:25:14,140
He very rarely see those
cause he's just Kinda can't,

3286
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:16,450
you kind of can't do those
without breaking your hand.

3287
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:17,920
And they did break their hands a lot.

3288
01:25:17,921 --> 01:25:18,550
So you know,

3289
01:25:18,550 --> 01:25:19,001
I started,

3290
01:25:19,001 --> 01:25:22,510
I thought that article I
wrote with a retrospective on,

3291
01:25:22,690 --> 01:25:23,380
remember this fight,

3292
01:25:23,380 --> 01:25:24,910
one of the greatest fights in the UFC,

3293
01:25:25,150 --> 01:25:27,430
a hackney versus Yarber all shore.

3294
01:25:27,490 --> 01:25:28,390
He bitch slapped him.

3295
01:25:28,570 --> 01:25:32,220
You know [inaudible] was like a
600 pound sumo wrestler who's six,

3296
01:25:32,260 --> 01:25:34,930
eight Agnes probably to 15 maybe he was,

3297
01:25:34,990 --> 01:25:37,990
he weighed in at 200 200 karate guy.

3298
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:42,090
And this was the early wild west
days of the USC where they like,

3299
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:43,181
what will happen?

3300
01:25:43,181 --> 01:25:43,631
We don't know.

3301
01:25:43,631 --> 01:25:43,920
Let's,

3302
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:44,770
let's see what happens.

3303
01:25:44,771 --> 01:25:45,460
What happens when,

3304
01:25:45,460 --> 01:25:45,761
you know,

3305
01:25:45,761 --> 01:25:49,300
a normal size man fights
a giant and you know,

3306
01:25:49,330 --> 01:25:50,410
long story short,

3307
01:25:50,710 --> 01:25:53,260
a hackney hits him in the head,

3308
01:25:53,650 --> 01:25:53,920
uh,

3309
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:55,540
41 straight times.

3310
01:25:55,541 --> 01:25:59,290
I counted with his right
hand and at some point,

3311
01:25:59,291 --> 01:25:59,650
you know,

3312
01:25:59,650 --> 01:26:03,620
he gets a yard boiled turtled up on the
ground and he's hitting him from the

3313
01:26:03,621 --> 01:26:04,010
back

3314
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:04,420
and he's,

3315
01:26:04,420 --> 01:26:05,660
he's hooking him from behind.

3316
01:26:05,661 --> 01:26:06,890
He's coming in the back of the skull.

3317
01:26:06,891 --> 01:26:07,880
You could do that back then.

3318
01:26:07,881 --> 01:26:09,260
He's raising his hand up high,

3319
01:26:09,261 --> 01:26:13,700
like a black Jack and he's like camera
focusing on one side and then hammer fist

3320
01:26:13,701 --> 01:26:16,880
and it on the other and he
just screwed up his hand,

3321
01:26:16,970 --> 01:26:17,360
uh,

3322
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:18,130
terribly.

3323
01:26:18,130 --> 01:26:18,511
Um,

3324
01:26:18,511 --> 01:26:18,760
so,

3325
01:26:18,760 --> 01:26:19,010
you know,

3326
01:26:19,010 --> 01:26:19,401
he walks,

3327
01:26:19,401 --> 01:26:19,551
you know,

3328
01:26:19,551 --> 01:26:20,550
Yarbrough walks out of the rings,

3329
01:26:20,551 --> 01:26:21,384
he's fine,

3330
01:26:21,570 --> 01:26:22,820
he tapped out verbally,

3331
01:26:22,821 --> 01:26:25,520
but he walked out of the ring
looking no worse for wear.

3332
01:26:25,730 --> 01:26:27,320
Those punches weren't all that effective.

3333
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:28,433
Um,

3334
01:26:28,770 --> 01:26:31,760
how can he goes out of the ring looking
at his fist and it's swelling up and

3335
01:26:31,761 --> 01:26:32,241
it's bleeding.

3336
01:26:32,241 --> 01:26:33,140
And that was the end for him.

3337
01:26:33,141 --> 01:26:35,450
He didn't get to go to the next
round because he had broken his hand.

3338
01:26:35,990 --> 01:26:36,580
And so,

3339
01:26:36,580 --> 01:26:37,110
you know,

3340
01:26:37,110 --> 01:26:37,943
to me it was,

3341
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:42,110
it's this great illustration of what
would have happened if hackney had a glove

3342
01:26:42,111 --> 01:26:42,830
on.

3343
01:26:42,830 --> 01:26:44,120
He would have beaten them to sleep.

3344
01:26:44,870 --> 01:26:45,590
Maybe.

3345
01:26:45,590 --> 01:26:48,140
Probably big head Yarbrough's in

3346
01:26:49,730 --> 01:26:53,570
Hackney is a strong guy and he
threw 41 punches at his brain,

3347
01:26:54,070 --> 01:26:54,560
you know,

3348
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:55,700
and how can it was put in,

3349
01:26:55,701 --> 01:26:57,050
your role was putting up no defense.

3350
01:26:57,051 --> 01:26:58,220
He weighed 600 pounds.

3351
01:26:58,400 --> 01:26:59,300
He couldn't get up.

3352
01:26:59,380 --> 01:26:59,750
Yeah.

3353
01:26:59,750 --> 01:27:00,950
He was stuck there on the ground.

3354
01:27:00,951 --> 01:27:03,320
He's just laying there and getting
punched in the head over and over and over

3355
01:27:03,321 --> 01:27:03,650
again.

3356
01:27:03,650 --> 01:27:03,801
Yeah.

3357
01:27:03,801 --> 01:27:06,920
He's probably in the worst shape of
any guy who ever fought in the UFC.

3358
01:27:07,430 --> 01:27:07,910
Yeah.

3359
01:27:07,910 --> 01:27:08,421
Maybe Aki.

3360
01:27:08,421 --> 01:27:09,940
Bono hoists crazy.

3361
01:27:09,960 --> 01:27:10,190
Yeah.

3362
01:27:10,190 --> 01:27:12,800
And in retrospect it looked incredibly
barbaric because you're like,

3363
01:27:12,801 --> 01:27:14,510
that guy should never have been in cage.

3364
01:27:14,570 --> 01:27:15,950
But people didn't know back then.

3365
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:16,551
Well,

3366
01:27:16,551 --> 01:27:17,910
he was a giant sumo champion.

3367
01:27:18,100 --> 01:27:18,831
He was giant.

3368
01:27:18,831 --> 01:27:20,240
He was someone athletic,

3369
01:27:20,241 --> 01:27:20,361
you know,

3370
01:27:20,361 --> 01:27:22,700
he did some kind of athletic
things in that Matt moved.

3371
01:27:22,850 --> 01:27:23,091
Yeah.

3372
01:27:23,091 --> 01:27:24,260
He moved like you did.

3373
01:27:24,980 --> 01:27:25,813
He did a,

3374
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:26,601
that was enough.

3375
01:27:26,601 --> 01:27:26,930
Yeah,

3376
01:27:26,930 --> 01:27:28,010
it was 600 pounds.

3377
01:27:28,190 --> 01:27:29,390
He's chasing like a giant.

3378
01:27:29,391 --> 01:27:30,190
He's got his arms out.

3379
01:27:30,190 --> 01:27:31,610
It's like Frankenstein chasing him down.

3380
01:27:31,611 --> 01:27:32,110
But you know,

3381
01:27:32,110 --> 01:27:32,320
he,

3382
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:32,600
he,

3383
01:27:32,600 --> 01:27:35,120
he literally through a
hackney through the cage,

3384
01:27:35,530 --> 01:27:35,780
you know,

3385
01:27:35,780 --> 01:27:37,700
threw him out of the
cage and down the stairs,

3386
01:27:37,701 --> 01:27:37,851
you know,

3387
01:27:37,851 --> 01:27:38,151
broke,

3388
01:27:38,151 --> 01:27:38,810
broke the,

3389
01:27:38,810 --> 01:27:39,590
broke the gate.

3390
01:27:39,590 --> 01:27:42,950
What would hackney did was hit him with
an open palm and I think that was the

3391
01:27:42,951 --> 01:27:45,110
first knockdown as think
if he stuck with that,

3392
01:27:45,111 --> 01:27:46,250
he probably wouldn't have broken his hand,

3393
01:27:46,280 --> 01:27:47,480
which is kind of amazing.

3394
01:27:47,481 --> 01:27:49,700
But for whatever reason you can,

3395
01:27:50,030 --> 01:27:53,690
you can hit things really hard like
that with the palm of your hand.

3396
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:55,370
And partly because you can
hit very hard that way.

3397
01:27:55,820 --> 01:27:55,941
Well,

3398
01:27:55,941 --> 01:27:57,100
you can't do it if you hit the,

3399
01:27:57,130 --> 01:27:57,370
it's,

3400
01:27:57,370 --> 01:27:58,051
it's the same thing.

3401
01:27:58,051 --> 01:27:58,380
And like you can,

3402
01:27:58,380 --> 01:27:59,600
if you're not turning it over,

3403
01:27:59,810 --> 01:28:02,360
was he ever watch boss route
and fight and pancreas?

3404
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:03,050
That's true.

3405
01:28:03,050 --> 01:28:04,460
Boss route and figured out how to do it.

3406
01:28:04,461 --> 01:28:04,820
Yeah.

3407
01:28:04,820 --> 01:28:08,720
I mean he was the first guy that really
figured out pancreas was organization.

3408
01:28:08,750 --> 01:28:09,110
Yeah.

3409
01:28:09,110 --> 01:28:12,710
Pancreas was an organization for folks
who don't know in Japan and they didn't

3410
01:28:12,711 --> 01:28:15,650
allow gloves and they also
didn't allow punches to the face.

3411
01:28:15,651 --> 01:28:16,820
You could kick the guy to the face,

3412
01:28:16,821 --> 01:28:18,740
but you were wearing wrestling shoes.

3413
01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:21,680
And then on top of those wrestling
shoes you had these big fat thin,

3414
01:28:21,770 --> 01:28:22,041
uh,

3415
01:28:22,041 --> 01:28:24,380
this big fat Shin and instep pad.

3416
01:28:24,890 --> 01:28:29,660
So there's this big padded up Shin thing
and then you had nothing on your hands.

3417
01:28:29,661 --> 01:28:33,260
So the guys would get a slap at each
other and try to kick each other.

3418
01:28:33,261 --> 01:28:34,810
And that was the rule to right.

3419
01:28:34,820 --> 01:28:35,810
You couldn't throw clothes hand,

3420
01:28:35,850 --> 01:28:37,160
I could not throw a closed hands,

3421
01:28:37,161 --> 01:28:38,810
but you could throw a
closed hands to the body.

3422
01:28:39,410 --> 01:28:44,410
But Bas Rutten who was a Dutch kickboxer
and had his fucking power explosion

3423
01:28:44,721 --> 01:28:45,350
style,

3424
01:28:45,350 --> 01:28:48,410
he was the first guy that figured out
if you just pull your hand way back,

3425
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:50,300
he throw that bitch just like a punch.

3426
01:28:51,080 --> 01:28:54,500
And he would upper cut guys and
hook guys and he would beat,

3427
01:28:54,501 --> 01:28:58,610
like when he fought food knocky he beat
the fucking shit out of him and he beat

3428
01:28:58,611 --> 01:29:00,830
him like a guy who's throwing punches.

3429
01:29:01,140 --> 01:29:02,160
I mean he would come at

3430
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:04,020
you with his hands pulled back like that.

3431
01:29:04,230 --> 01:29:05,880
And instead of doing what
everybody else was doing,

3432
01:29:05,881 --> 01:29:09,390
which just kind of throw these wild
bitch slaps bas Rutten was throwing them

3433
01:29:09,391 --> 01:29:12,780
straight down the pipe and somehow or
another he had stretched his hand out.

3434
01:29:13,020 --> 01:29:15,420
Well he could pull his hand way back.

3435
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:18,360
So he was just palming your
fucking nose in your brain.

3436
01:29:18,870 --> 01:29:19,740
He was nasty.

3437
01:29:20,160 --> 01:29:22,470
He was the first guy to
figure out like you could,

3438
01:29:22,471 --> 01:29:22,860
you could,

3439
01:29:22,860 --> 01:29:26,250
there's a different approach you can
take to this who's also one of the first

3440
01:29:26,251 --> 01:29:27,390
real strikers.

3441
01:29:27,700 --> 01:29:27,820
Uh,

3442
01:29:27,820 --> 01:29:31,540
you got to see the difference when
he kicked guys that fucking whack.

3443
01:29:31,570 --> 01:29:33,690
You feel it in their arms.

3444
01:29:34,490 --> 01:29:35,323
You know,

3445
01:29:35,490 --> 01:29:40,490
it's like one of the beautiful things
about watching the UFC since 93 all the

3446
01:29:40,531 --> 01:29:42,510
way up to 2015 where we are today is,

3447
01:29:42,511 --> 01:29:42,840
uh,

3448
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:47,360
the evolution of the understanding of
the techniques of what's effective in

3449
01:29:47,430 --> 01:29:48,420
certain positions.

3450
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:52,860
The distances and those guys like boss
route and were critical for establishing

3451
01:29:52,861 --> 01:29:53,694
that stuff.

3452
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:54,970
Know there's real pioneers.

3453
01:29:55,050 --> 01:29:56,970
Fucking nobody before him and pancreas,

3454
01:29:56,971 --> 01:29:57,900
they were fighting like that.

3455
01:29:57,910 --> 01:29:58,743
There's nobody,

3456
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:03,480
he came along with big power in his
kicks and ridiculous punching power.

3457
01:30:03,481 --> 01:30:06,030
And figured out how to
do it with the palm,

3458
01:30:06,420 --> 01:30:06,721
you know,

3459
01:30:06,721 --> 01:30:10,620
and then you see him fight in the UFC
when he could use punches before his body

3460
01:30:10,621 --> 01:30:11,580
started failing him.

3461
01:30:11,581 --> 01:30:13,980
Like he's had some
significant neck injuries.

3462
01:30:13,981 --> 01:30:17,700
And to the point where he has
significant atrophy of one of his arms,

3463
01:30:18,150 --> 01:30:18,661
one of his arms,

3464
01:30:18,661 --> 01:30:19,620
he calls baby arm.

3465
01:30:19,710 --> 01:30:19,940
Oh,

3466
01:30:19,940 --> 01:30:20,281
it's like,

3467
01:30:20,281 --> 01:30:20,551
yeah,

3468
01:30:20,551 --> 01:30:20,791
he's,

3469
01:30:20,791 --> 01:30:24,690
he's had it fixed and had some stem cell
stuff done and some operations and as

3470
01:30:24,691 --> 01:30:26,070
disks fuse in his neck.

3471
01:30:26,071 --> 01:30:28,470
And that stuff is a cost to this man.

3472
01:30:28,710 --> 01:30:29,543
Fuck gatherers.

3473
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:32,220
But my point is you watched
him fight against Chokey,

3474
01:30:32,221 --> 01:30:34,560
she'll Kosha Co TK,

3475
01:30:34,760 --> 01:30:35,011
uh,

3476
01:30:35,011 --> 01:30:37,510
in the UFC when he won the
heavyweight title and you know,

3477
01:30:37,530 --> 01:30:41,820
he was throwing fucking
brutal combinations and his
neck was so fucked up before

3478
01:30:41,821 --> 01:30:42,240
that fight.

3479
01:30:42,240 --> 01:30:43,140
He couldn't even wrestle.

3480
01:30:43,560 --> 01:30:45,150
He fought most of that fight.

3481
01:30:45,151 --> 01:30:46,260
And we're trained most of that fight,

3482
01:30:46,261 --> 01:30:48,390
just kickboxing because
his neck was so fucked up.

3483
01:30:49,260 --> 01:30:50,093
But you know,

3484
01:30:50,230 --> 01:30:53,940
I remember him wearing a red
boots and a Pancrase probably.

3485
01:30:54,120 --> 01:30:55,350
We're a bunch of different boots,

3486
01:30:55,410 --> 01:30:55,770
you know.

3487
01:30:55,770 --> 01:30:56,041
I bet.

3488
01:30:56,041 --> 01:30:57,030
But you could kick with the boots.

3489
01:30:57,150 --> 01:30:57,490
Oh yeah,

3490
01:30:57,490 --> 01:30:57,701
yeah,

3491
01:30:57,701 --> 01:30:57,981
yeah.

3492
01:30:57,981 --> 01:30:58,290
You have,

3493
01:30:58,290 --> 01:31:00,060
you had these wrestling
shoes on with these,

3494
01:31:00,061 --> 01:31:00,460
uh,

3495
01:31:00,460 --> 01:31:02,880
Shannon step cards over the
top of the wrestling shoes.

3496
01:31:03,090 --> 01:31:03,923
I thought he had like,

3497
01:31:04,280 --> 01:31:05,820
like big patent,

3498
01:31:05,821 --> 01:31:06,654
leather red,

3499
01:31:07,870 --> 01:31:08,401
no excuse,

3500
01:31:08,401 --> 01:31:08,940
miss misremembering.

3501
01:31:08,940 --> 01:31:10,230
And they were wrestling shoes.

3502
01:31:10,530 --> 01:31:10,771
Yeah,

3503
01:31:10,771 --> 01:31:11,670
they were wrestling shoes.

3504
01:31:11,671 --> 01:31:15,480
Pancrase had like an outfit that they
would make you where you would wear like

3505
01:31:15,481 --> 01:31:18,960
those little skivvies and you weren't
wearing like those MMA shorts the guys

3506
01:31:18,961 --> 01:31:19,561
wear today.

3507
01:31:19,561 --> 01:31:21,420
Everybody wore like this little speedos.

3508
01:31:21,450 --> 01:31:21,790
Yeah.

3509
01:31:21,790 --> 01:31:22,950
Little grape smugglers.

3510
01:31:23,330 --> 01:31:25,000
And you know,

3511
01:31:25,001 --> 01:31:25,170
it's,

3512
01:31:25,170 --> 01:31:26,003
it's,

3513
01:31:26,050 --> 01:31:29,820
it's like an important time
historically to watch those fights,

3514
01:31:30,120 --> 01:31:35,040
to say the difference between the way
they fought then and the way they fight

3515
01:31:35,041 --> 01:31:35,820
now.

3516
01:31:35,820 --> 01:31:36,151
It's,

3517
01:31:36,151 --> 01:31:36,984
um,

3518
01:31:37,320 --> 01:31:38,700
there's still room to grow.

3519
01:31:38,701 --> 01:31:41,040
But the problem is you
have athletic commissions,

3520
01:31:41,041 --> 01:31:42,180
you have bureaucracy,

3521
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:44,010
and you also have,

3522
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:45,031
look,

3523
01:31:45,031 --> 01:31:46,200
I love the UFC.

3524
01:31:46,380 --> 01:31:47,790
I love working for the UFC.

3525
01:31:47,791 --> 01:31:49,800
It's been an honor to work
for them all these years,

3526
01:31:49,801 --> 01:31:53,730
but they're going to have a certain amount
of stagnation when you have one group

3527
01:31:53,731 --> 01:31:56,370
in one organization that's so
dominant over the other ones.

3528
01:31:56,580 --> 01:32:00,130
I disagree that it's a
monopoly because Viacom

3529
01:32:00,160 --> 01:32:04,990
owns Bella tour and Viacom has
untold fucking billions of dollars.

3530
01:32:05,200 --> 01:32:08,620
They have an entire channel
they can promote it on the,

3531
01:32:08,621 --> 01:32:08,861
I mean,

3532
01:32:08,861 --> 01:32:13,210
Spike TV has an entire Friday night
lineup that's dedicated to combat sports,

3533
01:32:13,240 --> 01:32:14,073
boxing,

3534
01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:14,651
glory,

3535
01:32:14,651 --> 01:32:15,520
kickboxing mean.

3536
01:32:15,730 --> 01:32:18,050
There's plenty of eyes on spike I,

3537
01:32:18,180 --> 01:32:20,500
and they're also getting
guys from the UFC now.

3538
01:32:20,501 --> 01:32:22,760
Like they have Phil Davis
just sign with them.

3539
01:32:22,761 --> 01:32:23,260
Well yeah,

3540
01:32:23,260 --> 01:32:26,020
it's sort of the senior
league for the UFC.

3541
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:26,681
And there's also,

3542
01:32:26,681 --> 01:32:29,200
they picked up this
wrestler of the sky who,

3543
01:32:29,201 --> 01:32:29,380
uh,

3544
01:32:29,380 --> 01:32:32,290
helped Chris Weidman prepare
for one of his recent fights.

3545
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:32,760
They've,

3546
01:32:32,760 --> 01:32:33,011
they've,

3547
01:32:33,011 --> 01:32:36,850
they're starting to get like these big
time names guys that are coming up.

3548
01:32:37,270 --> 01:32:39,670
And a lot of that is also
because of the Reebok deal.

3549
01:32:39,671 --> 01:32:42,850
The UFC has a Reebok deal that doesn't
allow them to get their own sponsors.

3550
01:32:42,851 --> 01:32:44,370
They have to use the Reebok sponsorships.

3551
01:32:44,371 --> 01:32:46,240
So some guys are shying away
from it because of that.

3552
01:32:46,630 --> 01:32:49,270
So like the concept of a monopoly,

3553
01:32:49,330 --> 01:32:50,350
I just don't think it's fair.

3554
01:32:50,351 --> 01:32:51,940
I know I don't agree that it's a monopoly.

3555
01:32:51,941 --> 01:32:53,560
I think they're better
than the rest of them.

3556
01:32:53,770 --> 01:32:55,570
There's better competition.

3557
01:32:55,571 --> 01:32:56,710
They're better organized.

3558
01:32:56,711 --> 01:32:58,120
I think the production is better.

3559
01:32:58,121 --> 01:33:00,160
The people that direct it
and produce it or better,

3560
01:33:00,490 --> 01:33:03,460
they're just the best at what they do
because they've been doing it a long time.

3561
01:33:04,030 --> 01:33:06,640
But in having that like that,

3562
01:33:06,910 --> 01:33:10,030
there's a certain amount of stagnation
because if someone came along and had a

3563
01:33:10,031 --> 01:33:12,160
bare knuckle UFC style,

3564
01:33:12,790 --> 01:33:13,300
um,

3565
01:33:13,300 --> 01:33:13,631
you know,

3566
01:33:13,631 --> 01:33:18,631
mixed martial arts event where they
fought not in a cage but in a basketball

3567
01:33:18,790 --> 01:33:19,630
sized Matt,

3568
01:33:19,990 --> 01:33:20,471
you know,

3569
01:33:20,471 --> 01:33:23,440
like he like if you have
arena for basketball,

3570
01:33:23,680 --> 01:33:27,420
you have this big gigantic space
that you have a wooden floors,

3571
01:33:27,430 --> 01:33:28,390
parquet floor on.

3572
01:33:28,930 --> 01:33:31,630
How about do something like
that with the mats and have,

3573
01:33:31,660 --> 01:33:33,910
have mixed martial arts and
when they go out of bounds,

3574
01:33:33,911 --> 01:33:35,410
you bring them right back to center again.

3575
01:33:35,450 --> 01:33:36,580
You have them Duke it out again.

3576
01:33:37,110 --> 01:33:38,210
Cause I cause the fence,

3577
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:39,220
the fence is starting.

3578
01:33:39,340 --> 01:33:42,550
The fence is interesting
but it hurts visually.

3579
01:33:42,580 --> 01:33:44,080
You can't see that good me,

3580
01:33:44,081 --> 01:33:47,290
I can't see that good and have the best
fucking seat in the house for the UFC.

3581
01:33:47,620 --> 01:33:49,900
I'm touching the floor
that they're fighting,

3582
01:33:50,350 --> 01:33:51,760
literally touching the floor.

3583
01:33:51,790 --> 01:33:53,380
I see you looking at the
monitor all the time.

3584
01:33:53,800 --> 01:33:55,870
Sometimes I have to sometimes when,

3585
01:33:55,871 --> 01:33:59,380
when fighters like to the left or to the
right and the backs like they're like

3586
01:33:59,381 --> 01:34:00,220
up against the cage.

3587
01:34:00,490 --> 01:34:01,630
I have to look at the Monitor.

3588
01:34:01,660 --> 01:34:02,530
Otherwise I don't know what's going.

3589
01:34:02,531 --> 01:34:04,750
I don't know if you've ever looked at
the crowd and we're all looking at the

3590
01:34:04,751 --> 01:34:05,830
monitor to a lot of times.

3591
01:34:05,890 --> 01:34:07,030
I mean it's amazing to me.

3592
01:34:07,031 --> 01:34:09,730
People pay for this good
seats and everybody's looking
up at the screen because

3593
01:34:09,731 --> 01:34:10,260
the,

3594
01:34:10,260 --> 01:34:11,740
it just shows better up there.

3595
01:34:11,800 --> 01:34:13,150
Less so with boxing,

3596
01:34:13,240 --> 01:34:14,080
if you watched boxing,

3597
01:34:14,081 --> 01:34:17,230
people were looking at the ring most of
the time it's because of the ropes or

3598
01:34:17,450 --> 01:34:18,110
the way someone,

3599
01:34:18,110 --> 01:34:18,943
exactly.

3600
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:19,811
In that sense,

3601
01:34:19,811 --> 01:34:22,240
pride had the better idea
when it came to that,

3602
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:23,620
but um,

3603
01:34:23,650 --> 01:34:24,340
it was too hard,

3604
01:34:24,340 --> 01:34:28,300
too easy to go flying through the ropes
here they had a bunch of Japanese dudes

3605
01:34:28,301 --> 01:34:30,010
outside that we were like ready to press,

3606
01:34:30,130 --> 01:34:31,100
keep you from going out.

3607
01:34:31,101 --> 01:34:33,580
And they had guys like would
knock in your hand off the ropes.

3608
01:34:33,730 --> 01:34:35,080
It was that it was that.

3609
01:34:35,081 --> 01:34:37,460
It was also like a thought.

3610
01:34:37,500 --> 01:34:38,440
It was Paulo Filio.

3611
01:34:38,530 --> 01:34:42,120
I think someone used the ropes
want to catch a guy in an arm bar.

3612
01:34:42,250 --> 01:34:43,150
Like you had the guy,

3613
01:34:43,151 --> 01:34:46,390
like they were trapped inside the ropes
and the guy's arm was trapped in the

3614
01:34:46,391 --> 01:34:46,700
rope.

3615
01:34:46,700 --> 01:34:49,030
I was getting arm barred
and I was realizing like,

3616
01:34:49,031 --> 01:34:49,570
Whoa,

3617
01:34:49,570 --> 01:34:52,130
like he just used the rope
to get that submission.

3618
01:34:52,170 --> 01:34:53,140
This is kind of fucked.

3619
01:34:53,500 --> 01:34:54,820
Like the rope came into play.

3620
01:34:54,821 --> 01:34:57,350
It's almost like what
tank Abbott's submitted.

3621
01:34:57,351 --> 01:34:58,100
Steve Genom,

3622
01:34:58,100 --> 01:35:01,370
he had his knee to his head and he grabbed
the fence and he was holding onto the

3623
01:35:01,371 --> 01:35:04,100
fence and polling and
smashing them in the face.

3624
01:35:04,490 --> 01:35:09,490
You know that using the cage back then
like you can't grab the cage just like

3625
01:35:09,531 --> 01:35:11,360
you can't grab the ropes and pride,

3626
01:35:11,660 --> 01:35:14,740
but it did come into play too often.

3627
01:35:14,750 --> 01:35:16,520
It comes into play still too much too.

3628
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:17,631
It'd be interesting.

3629
01:35:17,631 --> 01:35:21,020
I'd like that because there's so much of
the action now is pushed up against the

3630
01:35:21,021 --> 01:35:21,680
fence.

3631
01:35:21,680 --> 01:35:23,450
I think if a guy grabs a fence,

3632
01:35:23,540 --> 01:35:24,920
immediate one point deduction,

3633
01:35:25,130 --> 01:35:25,760
immediate,

3634
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:26,630
immediate one point.

3635
01:35:26,780 --> 01:35:28,280
The problem is it's so reflexive.

3636
01:35:28,520 --> 01:35:29,240
It doesn't guys,

3637
01:35:29,240 --> 01:35:30,160
most guys don't mean to do.

3638
01:35:30,180 --> 01:35:30,291
It's,

3639
01:35:30,291 --> 01:35:30,800
it's like,

3640
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:31,280
you know,

3641
01:35:31,280 --> 01:35:32,150
some guys do,

3642
01:35:32,570 --> 01:35:34,310
some guys fucking grabbed that bitch,

3643
01:35:34,340 --> 01:35:35,030
they grab it.

3644
01:35:35,030 --> 01:35:35,810
They should know.

3645
01:35:35,810 --> 01:35:36,620
You should know.

3646
01:35:36,620 --> 01:35:37,000
That's true.

3647
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:37,111
I mean,

3648
01:35:37,111 --> 01:35:38,000
you gotta know,

3649
01:35:38,060 --> 01:35:39,170
you gotta fucking know.

3650
01:35:39,171 --> 01:35:42,410
And there's a big difference between a
guy grabbing the fence when you're trying

3651
01:35:42,411 --> 01:35:45,170
to take him down and then being able to
stand up and then kicks you in the head

3652
01:35:45,410 --> 01:35:48,920
and a guy not grabbing the fans and you
take him down and you dominate him for

3653
01:35:48,921 --> 01:35:49,551
the rest of the round.

3654
01:35:49,551 --> 01:35:51,140
And there's certainly could
never penalized on it.

3655
01:35:51,200 --> 01:35:51,650
No.

3656
01:35:51,650 --> 01:35:52,170
Well,

3657
01:35:52,170 --> 01:35:53,000
they get warnings.

3658
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,490
They should get an immediate
one point deduction.

3659
01:35:55,640 --> 01:35:59,930
Same thing for obvious Ipos and
immediate one point deduction.

3660
01:35:59,960 --> 01:36:01,220
And Dana has had this,

3661
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:02,331
Dana White said this,

3662
01:36:02,331 --> 01:36:03,590
that might be the only way to stop.

3663
01:36:03,591 --> 01:36:06,740
I pokes to give them an immediate one
point deduction and I think that might,

3664
01:36:06,890 --> 01:36:07,723
it might work.

3665
01:36:09,310 --> 01:36:11,960
I think there's gotta be a way
to cover the tips of the fingers.

3666
01:36:11,960 --> 01:36:12,440
I mean I don't,

3667
01:36:12,440 --> 01:36:14,840
I don't necessarily think that
these Bruce Lee style gloves,

3668
01:36:14,841 --> 01:36:17,690
that's what I was thinking were invented
in enter the dragon or the only way to

3669
01:36:17,691 --> 01:36:18,200
do it.

3670
01:36:18,200 --> 01:36:18,470
Yeah.

3671
01:36:18,470 --> 01:36:20,030
Well we haven't met
our gym like some guys.

3672
01:36:20,031 --> 01:36:20,864
Where are those?

3673
01:36:21,950 --> 01:36:23,000
The Bruce Lee style gloves.

3674
01:36:23,001 --> 01:36:23,181
Yeah,

3675
01:36:23,181 --> 01:36:23,870
those are cool.

3676
01:36:23,870 --> 01:36:28,520
But what I'm saying is something to cover
the tips of the fingers because as a

3677
01:36:28,521 --> 01:36:29,420
Jujitsu guy,

3678
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:30,710
like if I had like,

3679
01:36:30,711 --> 01:36:31,370
um,

3680
01:36:31,370 --> 01:36:31,851
say like,

3681
01:36:31,851 --> 01:36:33,590
you know those Everlast bag gloves,

3682
01:36:33,970 --> 01:36:37,220
you know those style they'd come over the
tips like those aren't really going to

3683
01:36:37,221 --> 01:36:42,080
impede my grappling that much because
I don't do this and I don't do this.

3684
01:36:42,140 --> 01:36:42,381
You know,

3685
01:36:42,381 --> 01:36:43,190
you never,

3686
01:36:43,190 --> 01:36:44,600
you never know what I'm saying.

3687
01:36:44,670 --> 01:36:44,830
I'm,

3688
01:36:44,830 --> 01:36:48,170
I'm showing something to honestly the
people who were listening but interlacing

3689
01:36:48,171 --> 01:36:48,651
your fingers,

3690
01:36:48,651 --> 01:36:49,670
you don't interlace your fingers.

3691
01:36:49,671 --> 01:36:54,290
You grab and like an escrip or you grab
and a gable grip and these grips that

3692
01:36:54,291 --> 01:36:58,190
you would do most of the really strong
grips don't ever involve your fingers

3693
01:36:58,191 --> 01:37:01,760
sliding into the grooves and each
other of the opposing fingers.

3694
01:37:02,330 --> 01:37:02,750
Huh.

3695
01:37:02,750 --> 01:37:06,290
But I feel like something like that
maybe could work where the tips of the

3696
01:37:06,291 --> 01:37:08,090
fingers were covered up and it wouldn't,

3697
01:37:08,210 --> 01:37:10,340
wouldn't affect you as
much if I poke somebody.

3698
01:37:11,560 --> 01:37:12,300
Um,

3699
01:37:12,300 --> 01:37:12,680
it was,

3700
01:37:12,680 --> 01:37:14,960
but what kind of like going
into a dark territory here,

3701
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:16,220
um,

3702
01:37:16,220 --> 01:37:21,140
d having this experience and I wanted
to get back to your peers because we

3703
01:37:21,141 --> 01:37:21,291
didn't,

3704
01:37:21,291 --> 01:37:22,580
I don't think we really completely,

3705
01:37:22,581 --> 01:37:23,000
uh,

3706
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:24,320
we kind of got off track with that.

3707
01:37:24,680 --> 01:37:29,060
Having these people stand
outside and watch you do this.

3708
01:37:29,390 --> 01:37:30,220
Was there,

3709
01:37:30,220 --> 01:37:31,053
uh,

3710
01:37:31,440 --> 01:37:31,850
the,

3711
01:37:31,850 --> 01:37:33,560
the reaction very,

3712
01:37:33,590 --> 01:37:35,360
or was it pretty,

3713
01:37:35,780 --> 01:37:39,320
pretty uniform or was there an extremes
on both ends where people like,

3714
01:37:39,530 --> 01:37:40,460
what the fuck are you doing?

3715
01:37:40,461 --> 01:37:41,151
And other people were like,

3716
01:37:41,151 --> 01:37:42,080
I want to be like you.

3717
01:37:43,340 --> 01:37:43,770
Ah,

3718
01:37:43,770 --> 01:37:45,380
I don't know if anybody was
saying I want to be like you.

3719
01:37:45,381 --> 01:37:46,214
I doubt that.

3720
01:37:46,220 --> 01:37:46,520
Uh,

3721
01:37:46,520 --> 01:37:47,353
but,

3722
01:37:47,420 --> 01:37:48,140
um,

3723
01:37:48,140 --> 01:37:49,670
I don't know what was said behind my back,

3724
01:37:49,820 --> 01:37:50,540
you know,

3725
01:37:50,540 --> 01:37:51,630
here we got Charles Dylan,

3726
01:37:51,670 --> 01:37:52,210
Jesus,

3727
01:37:52,210 --> 01:37:52,460
you know,

3728
01:37:52,460 --> 01:37:53,180
can you believe this?

3729
01:37:53,180 --> 01:37:53,590
Uh,

3730
01:37:53,590 --> 01:37:53,910
what a,

3731
01:37:53,910 --> 01:37:54,743
what a monster.

3732
01:37:55,110 --> 01:37:55,943
Um,

3733
01:37:56,820 --> 01:37:57,361
for the most part,

3734
01:37:57,361 --> 01:37:58,260
people were cool about it.

3735
01:37:58,261 --> 01:37:58,531
You know,

3736
01:37:58,531 --> 01:37:58,741
it's,

3737
01:37:58,741 --> 01:37:59,150
uh,

3738
01:37:59,150 --> 01:37:59,490
you know,

3739
01:37:59,490 --> 01:38:00,001
to my nail,

3740
01:38:00,001 --> 01:38:00,450
you,

3741
01:38:00,450 --> 01:38:01,283
they knew me,

3742
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:01,951
knew me,

3743
01:38:01,951 --> 01:38:02,521
and I knew,

3744
01:38:02,521 --> 01:38:03,354
you know,

3745
01:38:03,410 --> 01:38:03,930
uh,

3746
01:38:03,930 --> 01:38:04,950
and I made light of it,

3747
01:38:05,130 --> 01:38:05,311
you know,

3748
01:38:05,311 --> 01:38:05,980
to me it was always,

3749
01:38:05,980 --> 01:38:06,601
I always,

3750
01:38:06,601 --> 01:38:07,080
you know,

3751
01:38:07,080 --> 01:38:09,570
played it off in a sort
of a humorous way as a,

3752
01:38:09,571 --> 01:38:09,960
you know,

3753
01:38:09,960 --> 01:38:11,820
basically me being fed to the lions,

3754
01:38:12,030 --> 01:38:12,863
right?

3755
01:38:12,900 --> 01:38:13,733
So,

3756
01:38:14,010 --> 01:38:14,480
but again,

3757
01:38:14,480 --> 01:38:16,580
the bigger for the bigger problem
is in the wider professional.

3758
01:38:16,600 --> 01:38:19,870
People don't know me and you know,

3759
01:38:19,880 --> 01:38:20,010
when,

3760
01:38:20,010 --> 01:38:22,290
so when those sort of people
get Ahold of the book,

3761
01:38:22,340 --> 01:38:22,590
uh,

3762
01:38:22,590 --> 01:38:23,371
I hope they read it,

3763
01:38:23,371 --> 01:38:24,180
you know,

3764
01:38:24,180 --> 01:38:25,110
because the book is,

3765
01:38:25,580 --> 01:38:26,100
uh,

3766
01:38:26,100 --> 01:38:27,720
it's not really even
about mixed more shorts,

3767
01:38:27,750 --> 01:38:27,991
you know,

3768
01:38:27,991 --> 01:38:32,850
it's about using mixed martial arts as
this bridge into big questions about

3769
01:38:32,851 --> 01:38:33,684
human behavior,

3770
01:38:33,690 --> 01:38:38,690
especially who in male behavior and the
nature of masculinity and all the dumb

3771
01:38:38,731 --> 01:38:39,690
stuff we get up to.

3772
01:38:40,140 --> 01:38:42,060
And it's one of the
reasons I thought of you,

3773
01:38:42,690 --> 01:38:43,523
um,

3774
01:38:43,650 --> 01:38:44,880
as I was writing the book actually,

3775
01:38:44,970 --> 01:38:45,210
you know,

3776
01:38:45,210 --> 01:38:45,551
I,

3777
01:38:45,551 --> 01:38:46,200
you know,

3778
01:38:46,200 --> 01:38:48,840
a lot of people write a book and they
don't have anybody in mind for it to have

3779
01:38:48,841 --> 01:38:49,180
like a,

3780
01:38:49,180 --> 01:38:49,860
uh,

3781
01:38:49,860 --> 01:38:52,530
a vague nebulous sense of who
the readers are going to be.

3782
01:38:52,830 --> 01:38:53,491
I never works for me.

3783
01:38:53,491 --> 01:38:55,140
I always have to think
of an actual person,

3784
01:38:55,620 --> 01:38:56,010
you know,

3785
01:38:56,010 --> 01:38:56,940
who's going to read this book.

3786
01:38:56,941 --> 01:38:58,560
Like who would be the ideal reader for me.

3787
01:38:58,830 --> 01:38:59,663
And for me it was you,

3788
01:38:59,780 --> 01:39:01,500
I thought you a lot when
I was reading this book,

3789
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:02,011
uh,

3790
01:39:02,011 --> 01:39:02,611
as a person,

3791
01:39:02,611 --> 01:39:05,160
like who would be interested
in this subject matter,

3792
01:39:05,550 --> 01:39:05,820
uh,

3793
01:39:05,820 --> 01:39:09,610
charitable and generous about it
because these are things that uh,

3794
01:39:09,720 --> 01:39:10,050
you've,

3795
01:39:10,050 --> 01:39:13,950
you wonder about too and also sort of
meshes with not only your interest in

3796
01:39:13,951 --> 01:39:14,281
fighting,

3797
01:39:14,281 --> 01:39:18,060
but your whole interest in human
behavior and especially you're basically

3798
01:39:18,061 --> 01:39:23,061
evolutionary a outlook on
human life and human behavior.

3799
01:39:23,740 --> 01:39:24,750
That's what the book is really about.

3800
01:39:24,751 --> 01:39:26,630
It's sort of an
evolutionary exploration of,

3801
01:39:26,631 --> 01:39:26,860
of,

3802
01:39:26,860 --> 01:39:27,271
of the,

3803
01:39:27,271 --> 01:39:28,410
of the basis of,

3804
01:39:28,411 --> 01:39:29,910
of masculinity and manhood.

3805
01:39:30,180 --> 01:39:30,660
That's a,

3806
01:39:30,660 --> 01:39:33,900
that's a very interesting
way of approaching it
because I think that's one of

3807
01:39:33,901 --> 01:39:38,670
the issues that people have when it comes
to the idea of mixed martial arts or

3808
01:39:38,671 --> 01:39:43,671
the idea of any sort of combat sport is
that in embracing that and supporting it

3809
01:39:44,790 --> 01:39:49,230
or in even just pursuing
it somehow or another,

3810
01:39:49,290 --> 01:39:53,610
we're doing a disservice to the idea of
a cultural evolution that we kind of all

3811
01:39:53,611 --> 01:39:54,780
agree is going on.

3812
01:39:55,170 --> 01:40:00,170
If you compare society and human beings
and our behavior today with what we know

3813
01:40:00,661 --> 01:40:02,340
about several thousands of years ago,

3814
01:40:02,341 --> 01:40:04,590
we know that we're in a far safer time,

3815
01:40:04,860 --> 01:40:06,240
far more civil time,

3816
01:40:06,640 --> 01:40:07,380
uh,

3817
01:40:07,380 --> 01:40:09,210
for the most part in
most places of the world.

3818
01:40:09,211 --> 01:40:10,320
Obviously there's exceptions,

3819
01:40:10,321 --> 01:40:14,820
but overwhelmingly the people that are
communicating now we're communicating

3820
01:40:14,821 --> 01:40:18,030
about w we have an understanding
about what we would call,

3821
01:40:18,300 --> 01:40:18,571
you know,

3822
01:40:18,571 --> 01:40:19,050
what they,

3823
01:40:19,050 --> 01:40:22,170
the super progressive to
call toxic masculinity.

3824
01:40:22,170 --> 01:40:23,003
Man,

3825
01:40:23,160 --> 01:40:23,560
you know,

3826
01:40:23,560 --> 01:40:23,830
which,

3827
01:40:23,830 --> 01:40:25,110
and part of me,

3828
01:40:25,740 --> 01:40:27,900
part of me understands
where they're coming from.

3829
01:40:27,901 --> 01:40:29,930
And part of me also thinks that
where they're coming with their,

3830
01:40:29,931 --> 01:40:32,810
their kind of copping
out and they're denying,

3831
01:40:33,230 --> 01:40:36,810
there's still denying certain aspects
of their own life and their own

3832
01:40:36,840 --> 01:40:39,570
masculinity that maybe they,

3833
01:40:39,630 --> 01:40:39,960
uh,

3834
01:40:39,960 --> 01:40:44,460
they feel are weak and maybe they feel
like they can't compete in these areas

3835
01:40:44,461 --> 01:40:45,600
and they feel intimidated.

3836
01:40:45,720 --> 01:40:46,920
So they want to demean them.

3837
01:40:47,400 --> 01:40:48,900
And I don't think that's right either.

3838
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:49,141
You know,

3839
01:40:49,141 --> 01:40:49,974
like there's some,

3840
01:40:50,370 --> 01:40:50,491
well,

3841
01:40:50,491 --> 01:40:52,170
masculinity is complex,

3842
01:40:52,171 --> 01:40:52,381
you know,

3843
01:40:52,381 --> 01:40:53,214
and it is there,

3844
01:40:53,290 --> 01:40:54,460
there are things about it.

3845
01:40:54,490 --> 01:40:55,271
So it's femininity,

3846
01:40:55,271 --> 01:40:55,600
right?

3847
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:55,890
I mean,

3848
01:40:55,890 --> 01:40:59,050
was being a human being
a human is a complex,

3849
01:40:59,100 --> 01:40:59,390
uh,

3850
01:40:59,390 --> 01:40:59,951
sort of thing.

3851
01:40:59,951 --> 01:41:00,370
And there are,

3852
01:41:00,370 --> 01:41:01,190
there is something,

3853
01:41:01,190 --> 01:41:06,190
there is a case to be made
that masculinity run a muck
is the great problem of

3854
01:41:07,121 --> 01:41:07,870
history.

3855
01:41:07,870 --> 01:41:08,081
Oh,

3856
01:41:08,081 --> 01:41:09,840
no doubt that men's,

3857
01:41:09,880 --> 01:41:10,180
uh,

3858
01:41:10,180 --> 01:41:14,110
tendencies towards aggression towards
kind of silly forms of competition towards

3859
01:41:14,111 --> 01:41:15,550
physical forms of violence.

3860
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:16,660
Um,

3861
01:41:16,660 --> 01:41:17,471
you know,

3862
01:41:17,471 --> 01:41:19,110
that's what's been the
big problem all along.

3863
01:41:19,220 --> 01:41:20,950
Even though the world
has gotten a lot safer,

3864
01:41:21,100 --> 01:41:23,380
it's still may finish us off in the end.

3865
01:41:23,410 --> 01:41:23,561
Well,

3866
01:41:23,561 --> 01:41:24,820
that's the ultimate fear,

3867
01:41:24,821 --> 01:41:25,121
right?

3868
01:41:25,121 --> 01:41:29,410
The ultimate fear is that one dick waving
contest will lead to nuclear war and

3869
01:41:29,411 --> 01:41:31,420
then we'll all be fucking so plausible.

3870
01:41:31,450 --> 01:41:32,470
Knocking rocks together,

3871
01:41:32,471 --> 01:41:33,220
start fires.

3872
01:41:33,220 --> 01:41:33,970
So plausible,

3873
01:41:33,970 --> 01:41:35,650
especially look at some
parts of the world,

3874
01:41:35,651 --> 01:41:39,310
they were like fucking way closer
than we are to Russia to chill.

3875
01:41:39,340 --> 01:41:42,900
Like you look at like what North Korea
has threatened to do to South Korea,

3876
01:41:42,910 --> 01:41:44,230
what Pakistan and India,

3877
01:41:44,290 --> 01:41:46,270
when they look at each
other and you mother Fucker,

3878
01:41:46,271 --> 01:41:47,800
I got a missile at your name on it.

3879
01:41:48,490 --> 01:41:48,821
Easy.

3880
01:41:48,821 --> 01:41:51,400
All it takes is the wrong guy
with the right amount of power.

3881
01:41:51,401 --> 01:41:55,360
And that can happen and it's very likely
that we're saying guy for a reason.

3882
01:41:55,420 --> 01:41:56,680
It's not going to be the wrong woman.

3883
01:41:56,681 --> 01:41:57,180
Yes.

3884
01:41:57,180 --> 01:41:57,600
You know,

3885
01:41:57,600 --> 01:41:58,061
and yeah,

3886
01:41:58,061 --> 01:41:58,894
there is a certain,

3887
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:00,490
there's certain reality that,

3888
01:42:00,520 --> 01:42:05,140
but there's also certain reality to the
fact that the reason why we have these

3889
01:42:05,141 --> 01:42:06,790
thoughts and ideas and the,

3890
01:42:06,791 --> 01:42:10,060
that we have this quote unquote toxic
masculinity in the first place is because

3891
01:42:10,360 --> 01:42:12,040
it served our genes well.

3892
01:42:12,220 --> 01:42:16,300
That's why we got to 2015 that's
why we fought off the competition.

3893
01:42:16,330 --> 01:42:18,550
And unfortunately,

3894
01:42:18,610 --> 01:42:20,940
I think there's a yin and a Yang to life.

3895
01:42:20,950 --> 01:42:24,940
There's a give and a take and there's an
action and a reaction when it comes to

3896
01:42:24,941 --> 01:42:28,660
aggression and when it comes
to fear and danger and that,

3897
01:42:28,690 --> 01:42:31,150
that reaction is innovation.

3898
01:42:31,490 --> 01:42:32,180
Um,

3899
01:42:32,180 --> 01:42:35,200
reinforcing the safer aspects of society,

3900
01:42:35,500 --> 01:42:36,610
law enforcement.

3901
01:42:36,640 --> 01:42:41,640
There's all these different reactions
to violence that lead to a better world.

3902
01:42:42,280 --> 01:42:42,641
Yeah.

3903
01:42:42,641 --> 01:42:42,971
And that's,

3904
01:42:42,971 --> 01:42:43,750
and that's really,

3905
01:42:43,750 --> 01:42:44,140
uh,

3906
01:42:44,140 --> 01:42:44,640
what the,

3907
01:42:44,640 --> 01:42:46,180
what the focus of my book is.

3908
01:42:46,180 --> 01:42:46,331
You know,

3909
01:42:46,331 --> 01:42:46,411
I,

3910
01:42:46,411 --> 01:42:46,700
I,

3911
01:42:46,700 --> 01:42:46,871
again,

3912
01:42:46,871 --> 01:42:51,871
I expected to write a book with MMA
as a metaphor for this darkness is

3913
01:42:52,271 --> 01:42:52,961
blackness,

3914
01:42:52,961 --> 01:42:53,711
this danger,

3915
01:42:53,711 --> 01:42:55,780
this nastiness that the
core of human nature.

3916
01:42:55,781 --> 01:42:56,531
That's what I expected.

3917
01:42:56,531 --> 01:42:57,760
I wrote a very different book than that.

3918
01:42:58,330 --> 01:43:01,480
The book ended up being a book about
something that I call the monkey dance.

3919
01:43:01,930 --> 01:43:02,470
Um,

3920
01:43:02,470 --> 01:43:03,040
and,

3921
01:43:03,040 --> 01:43:03,340
uh,

3922
01:43:03,340 --> 01:43:07,330
if you've ever seen like a nature video
of two elephants seals clashing and the

3923
01:43:07,331 --> 01:43:11,110
server for two mountain
goats cracking skulls on a,

3924
01:43:11,170 --> 01:43:12,003
on a hillside,

3925
01:43:12,430 --> 01:43:14,290
biologists call those sorts of contests.

3926
01:43:14,291 --> 01:43:15,760
It call it ritual combat.

3927
01:43:16,090 --> 01:43:16,430
Um,

3928
01:43:16,430 --> 01:43:20,680
and ritual combat is a way that a
huge diversity of animal species have

3929
01:43:20,681 --> 01:43:23,770
developed to figure out who's bigger,

3930
01:43:23,771 --> 01:43:24,551
who's tougher,

3931
01:43:24,551 --> 01:43:25,301
who's stronger,

3932
01:43:25,301 --> 01:43:28,780
who's fitter without fighting
it out to the bitter bloody.

3933
01:43:28,781 --> 01:43:32,080
And like chimps grab sticks and
they pulled them out of the ground.

3934
01:43:32,081 --> 01:43:35,140
They beat the shit out of trees
with them more than people fight.

3935
01:43:35,170 --> 01:43:35,890
Exactly.

3936
01:43:35,890 --> 01:43:36,260
Yeah.

3937
01:43:36,260 --> 01:43:37,093
So Kim's have,

3938
01:43:37,260 --> 01:43:38,350
and that's the monkey dance.

3939
01:43:38,600 --> 01:43:38,980
Um,

3940
01:43:38,980 --> 01:43:41,150
and so in humans or animals too,

3941
01:43:41,770 --> 01:43:43,540
most people seem to like to forget this,

3942
01:43:43,541 --> 01:43:44,770
but what we're animals too,

3943
01:43:44,771 --> 01:43:46,720
we're complex animals
were cultured animals.

3944
01:43:46,721 --> 01:43:47,890
We're animals still.

3945
01:43:48,280 --> 01:43:52,190
And the monkey dance is my name
for human versions of ritual

3946
01:43:52,190 --> 01:43:53,023
combat.

3947
01:43:53,110 --> 01:43:53,470
Uh,

3948
01:43:53,470 --> 01:43:54,950
and it's a broad diversity of things.

3949
01:43:55,010 --> 01:43:59,750
Mainly men get up to things like
a deadly duals and verbal tools,

3950
01:43:59,770 --> 01:44:00,260
uh,

3951
01:44:00,260 --> 01:44:01,640
play fights among boys.

3952
01:44:01,670 --> 01:44:01,931
And,

3953
01:44:01,931 --> 01:44:03,800
and it's especially a sports.

3954
01:44:04,220 --> 01:44:06,230
And so a lot of these behaviors,

3955
01:44:06,980 --> 01:44:09,260
the key things that a lot of
these behaviors seem silly.

3956
01:44:09,261 --> 01:44:10,130
They seem stupid.

3957
01:44:10,131 --> 01:44:13,130
They seem pathetic there often volatile,

3958
01:44:13,131 --> 01:44:15,980
and they are in danger of escalating
to something truly dangerous.

3959
01:44:16,340 --> 01:44:16,980
But on the whole,

3960
01:44:16,980 --> 01:44:18,880
these monkey dances
are a good thing there.

3961
01:44:18,890 --> 01:44:22,130
A way that men can work
out their problems,

3962
01:44:22,131 --> 01:44:23,240
thrash out their status,

3963
01:44:23,241 --> 01:44:27,050
hierarchies in ways
that fall short of Apps,

3964
01:44:27,080 --> 01:44:27,291
you know,

3965
01:44:27,291 --> 01:44:28,970
all that allowed sorts of violence.

3966
01:44:28,971 --> 01:44:30,920
So the tips are a great example of this.

3967
01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:31,530
You know,

3968
01:44:31,530 --> 01:44:33,470
and humans do exactly the same thing.

3969
01:44:33,920 --> 01:44:37,910
If you're at a bar and you knock shoulders
with somebody and somebody spills

3970
01:44:37,940 --> 01:44:38,773
their beer,

3971
01:44:39,050 --> 01:44:39,620
um,

3972
01:44:39,620 --> 01:44:39,960
it's,

3973
01:44:39,960 --> 01:44:40,290
it's,

3974
01:44:40,290 --> 01:44:41,720
it's likely to go down like this.

3975
01:44:41,721 --> 01:44:43,960
There'll be some sort of insult us
with some sort of challenge them.

3976
01:44:43,961 --> 01:44:45,350
World Women feel disrespected,

3977
01:44:45,650 --> 01:44:46,490
dishonored,

3978
01:44:46,790 --> 01:44:47,001
uh,

3979
01:44:47,001 --> 01:44:48,860
they'll bluster back and forth.

3980
01:44:49,040 --> 01:44:50,300
Does that goes chimps in the jungle.

3981
01:44:50,301 --> 01:44:52,100
But at some 0.1 of the guys is like,

3982
01:44:52,101 --> 01:44:53,180
can I want to do this?

3983
01:44:53,181 --> 01:44:53,691
And you'll say,

3984
01:44:53,691 --> 01:44:54,500
sorry,

3985
01:44:54,500 --> 01:44:56,870
or you'll or you'll walk away.

3986
01:44:57,100 --> 01:44:57,410
Um,

3987
01:44:57,410 --> 01:44:58,243
and if you don't,

3988
01:44:58,280 --> 01:44:59,930
it continues to escalate.

3989
01:44:59,960 --> 01:45:01,110
The guys will close the distance.

3990
01:45:01,111 --> 01:45:02,850
So push the punch or tackle the cow.

3991
01:45:03,190 --> 01:45:05,230
We're talking about a totally
different sort of situation then.

3992
01:45:05,231 --> 01:45:08,530
Then competition when nowhere we're
talking about when you're talking about

3993
01:45:08,531 --> 01:45:09,131
bars,

3994
01:45:09,131 --> 01:45:10,930
you're talking about social things.

3995
01:45:11,290 --> 01:45:12,480
They talking about carve.

3996
01:45:12,481 --> 01:45:13,180
I mean,

3997
01:45:13,180 --> 01:45:14,013
honestly,

3998
01:45:14,080 --> 01:45:15,040
no one knows.

3999
01:45:15,100 --> 01:45:15,430
You know,

4000
01:45:15,430 --> 01:45:16,690
when you bumped into a guy in a bar,

4001
01:45:16,691 --> 01:45:18,100
you don't know who the
fuck you're dealing with.

4002
01:45:18,101 --> 01:45:19,240
You don't know anything about it.

4003
01:45:19,270 --> 01:45:19,560
You know,

4004
01:45:19,560 --> 01:45:20,160
you just,

4005
01:45:20,160 --> 01:45:24,490
it's a matter of a lot of chest puffing
and a lot of posturing and usually

4006
01:45:24,491 --> 01:45:25,870
enough sometimes.

4007
01:45:26,110 --> 01:45:27,200
But the,

4008
01:45:27,250 --> 01:45:29,050
what my take on it is,

4009
01:45:29,080 --> 01:45:29,950
is that there's a big,

4010
01:45:29,980 --> 01:45:34,780
there's a big difference between that
and what guys are doing to establish

4011
01:45:35,110 --> 01:45:35,943
greatness,

4012
01:45:36,100 --> 01:45:36,940
what they're doing too.

4013
01:45:36,941 --> 01:45:39,220
When you achieve
greatness in martial arts,

4014
01:45:39,340 --> 01:45:44,340
what you're essentially doing by becoming
a champion is you're showing a genetic

4015
01:45:45,130 --> 01:45:46,090
superiority.

4016
01:45:46,091 --> 01:45:47,800
You're sewing a mental superiority,

4017
01:45:47,801 --> 01:45:52,801
a character superiority that makes
you more preferred for breeding.

4018
01:45:53,380 --> 01:45:53,591
I mean,

4019
01:45:53,591 --> 01:45:55,270
that's just the reality situation.

4020
01:45:55,271 --> 01:45:56,290
Like I joke around about it,

4021
01:45:56,291 --> 01:45:57,190
but it's Kinda true.

4022
01:45:57,400 --> 01:45:59,020
The only reason why anybody gets laid his,

4023
01:45:59,021 --> 01:46:00,830
cause Luke Rockhold
didn't get there first.

4024
01:46:00,831 --> 01:46:01,720
So that was the greatest line.

4025
01:46:01,730 --> 01:46:02,770
And it's completely true.

4026
01:46:03,010 --> 01:46:03,700
It's so true.

4027
01:46:03,700 --> 01:46:05,470
My wife would have
little rock hold babies.

4028
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:06,593
She could,

4029
01:46:06,700 --> 01:46:08,260
nobody wants to admit that,

4030
01:46:08,261 --> 01:46:08,531
you know,

4031
01:46:08,531 --> 01:46:13,210
because nobody wants to admit
that no man was not into that.

4032
01:46:13,211 --> 01:46:14,380
And it's not just the way he looks,

4033
01:46:14,381 --> 01:46:15,910
it's that he is that guy.

4034
01:46:15,970 --> 01:46:16,301
We are.

4035
01:46:16,301 --> 01:46:17,080
So we all,

4036
01:46:17,080 --> 01:46:20,010
we have an organic vegan
garden together and we,

4037
01:46:20,011 --> 01:46:20,181
you know,

4038
01:46:20,181 --> 01:46:21,260
we were amazingly connected.

4039
01:46:21,350 --> 01:46:24,230
Your wife wants to fuck Luke
Rockhold is deal with it.

4040
01:46:24,260 --> 01:46:24,471
No,

4041
01:46:24,471 --> 01:46:25,011
I think that's right.

4042
01:46:25,011 --> 01:46:27,770
I mean when it comes right down to it
and you walk around in the world and you

4043
01:46:27,771 --> 01:46:31,430
see these differences between men and
women and you see physical differences,

4044
01:46:31,431 --> 01:46:34,370
you see behavioral differences and you
naturally asking where does all this

4045
01:46:34,371 --> 01:46:35,204
stuff coming from?

4046
01:46:35,610 --> 01:46:37,730
And part of it comes from culture.

4047
01:46:37,731 --> 01:46:38,630
There's no doubt about it.

4048
01:46:38,960 --> 01:46:39,201
Uh,

4049
01:46:39,201 --> 01:46:40,034
but a lot of it is,

4050
01:46:40,190 --> 01:46:41,180
is biology.

4051
01:46:41,300 --> 01:46:42,410
It's total biology.

4052
01:46:42,411 --> 01:46:45,560
Women aren't showing up at
hospitals trying to fuck
dudes right before they die.

4053
01:46:45,950 --> 01:46:48,750
They're not trying to pull their
dicks out whether coffin blood,

4054
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:51,600
he just something about
you're so vulnerable.

4055
01:46:51,601 --> 01:46:52,434
I need you inside me.

4056
01:46:52,870 --> 01:46:53,550
It's not,

4057
01:46:53,550 --> 01:46:54,390
this is not what they do.

4058
01:46:54,391 --> 01:46:54,591
They're,

4059
01:46:54,591 --> 01:46:58,650
they're attracted by power and strength
and character and not just strength as

4060
01:46:58,651 --> 01:47:00,960
far as like the ability
to oppress other people.

4061
01:47:00,961 --> 01:47:03,180
Like we traditionally
look at those things,

4062
01:47:03,181 --> 01:47:07,470
or it's in vogue to look at
those masculine characteristics
as being negative.

4063
01:47:08,460 --> 01:47:13,170
You know that Europe you're oppressing
others are the toxic masculinity handle,

4064
01:47:13,530 --> 01:47:16,590
but she's choosing a good
hunter and a good provider,

4065
01:47:16,650 --> 01:47:19,950
but also someone productive who
can deal when the shit goes down.

4066
01:47:20,130 --> 01:47:21,210
Some dudes,

4067
01:47:21,450 --> 01:47:21,811
they,

4068
01:47:21,811 --> 01:47:22,410
you know when they'll,

4069
01:47:22,410 --> 01:47:27,410
they'll chirp all around about toxic
masculinity or negative male behavior or,

4070
01:47:28,140 --> 01:47:30,750
but the reality is they don't
have any fucking character.

4071
01:47:30,930 --> 01:47:32,850
And if something happens
really bad in their life,

4072
01:47:32,851 --> 01:47:34,610
they start weeping and they fall apart.

4073
01:47:34,611 --> 01:47:35,910
And that's unattractive.

4074
01:47:36,030 --> 01:47:38,130
And the reason it's
unattractive to your friends,

4075
01:47:38,310 --> 01:47:40,290
if you have a friend and every time
something goes wrong in his life,

4076
01:47:40,291 --> 01:47:41,520
he starts crying and he wants a hug.

4077
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:41,910
You like,

4078
01:47:41,910 --> 01:47:42,361
Jesus,

4079
01:47:42,361 --> 01:47:42,840
Bitch,

4080
01:47:42,840 --> 01:47:44,130
get your fucking shit together.

4081
01:47:44,430 --> 01:47:45,210
Come on dude.

4082
01:47:45,210 --> 01:47:46,043
And that's how,

4083
01:47:46,290 --> 01:47:49,230
that's how you're supposed to feel
because you know that that guy,

4084
01:47:49,231 --> 01:47:50,430
if anything goes wrong,

4085
01:47:50,790 --> 01:47:53,580
that guy's not going to be a good ally.

4086
01:47:53,581 --> 01:47:54,420
He's not a good ally.

4087
01:47:54,421 --> 01:47:55,980
He's not good to have in the tribe.

4088
01:47:56,460 --> 01:48:01,460
And these are unfortunate but realistic
aspects of being a human being.

4089
01:48:01,771 --> 01:48:02,850
In the 21st century.

4090
01:48:03,180 --> 01:48:04,290
It's still there.

4091
01:48:04,410 --> 01:48:05,250
It's still there.

4092
01:48:05,251 --> 01:48:05,521
I mean,

4093
01:48:05,521 --> 01:48:09,720
one day we might come to some point when
we have so much control over the world

4094
01:48:09,721 --> 01:48:10,470
that we live in,

4095
01:48:10,470 --> 01:48:12,540
that masculinity won't be unnecessary.

4096
01:48:12,541 --> 01:48:13,500
And that that's the case.

4097
01:48:13,710 --> 01:48:16,890
We'll probably evolve to the point
where we look like the aliens that are

4098
01:48:16,891 --> 01:48:20,070
depicted in every movie
with a giant hand muscles,

4099
01:48:20,100 --> 01:48:20,791
no muscles,

4100
01:48:20,791 --> 01:48:23,930
and the giant head that uses
telekinesis to move things.

4101
01:48:23,950 --> 01:48:24,181
I mean,

4102
01:48:24,181 --> 01:48:25,710
that's probably where we're headed.

4103
01:48:25,960 --> 01:48:26,480
I mean,

4104
01:48:26,480 --> 01:48:26,731
yeah,

4105
01:48:26,731 --> 01:48:27,150
you're right.

4106
01:48:27,150 --> 01:48:27,301
I mean,

4107
01:48:27,301 --> 01:48:29,940
the world has gotten softer and softer
and safer and safer and we're still,

4108
01:48:29,970 --> 01:48:30,803
we're still,

4109
01:48:30,900 --> 01:48:31,733
uh,

4110
01:48:31,890 --> 01:48:33,030
carrying this baggage,

4111
01:48:33,060 --> 01:48:34,980
this evolutionary baggage of a,

4112
01:48:34,981 --> 01:48:39,510
of a sort of masculinity that's
best suited to a world where,

4113
01:48:39,511 --> 01:48:39,661
you know,

4114
01:48:39,661 --> 01:48:42,810
there's barbarians at the gates
and bears in the woods and uh,

4115
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:43,410
all that,

4116
01:48:43,410 --> 01:48:44,280
all that stuff.

4117
01:48:44,310 --> 01:48:46,170
But in this same world,

4118
01:48:46,200 --> 01:48:50,250
there are avenues to express this
maximum masculinity where you can be

4119
01:48:50,251 --> 01:48:51,930
completely civil,

4120
01:48:52,050 --> 01:48:53,730
when you can be completely kind,

4121
01:48:53,731 --> 01:48:55,200
you can be a generous person,

4122
01:48:55,500 --> 01:48:59,190
but get over your own genetics in a way.

4123
01:48:59,191 --> 01:49:01,440
Give yourself difficult tasks to do.

4124
01:49:01,650 --> 01:49:03,090
And even what we were
talking about earlier,

4125
01:49:03,091 --> 01:49:04,650
fucking yoga can do that.

4126
01:49:04,950 --> 01:49:08,730
It doesn't have to be beating the shit
out of each other in a cave two and a

4127
01:49:08,731 --> 01:49:09,900
cage to achieve this,

4128
01:49:10,160 --> 01:49:10,720
but,

4129
01:49:10,720 --> 01:49:13,410
but the victory over your own self.

4130
01:49:13,410 --> 01:49:14,101
That's what it is.

4131
01:49:14,101 --> 01:49:14,490
Yeah.

4132
01:49:14,490 --> 01:49:14,881
That's what I,

4133
01:49:14,881 --> 01:49:15,960
that's why I didn't know going in.

4134
01:49:16,140 --> 01:49:17,030
That's why I didn't know going in.

4135
01:49:17,050 --> 01:49:17,880
I figured,

4136
01:49:17,880 --> 01:49:20,610
I figured those guys must
like beating people up.

4137
01:49:20,980 --> 01:49:21,813
It's muscle muscle.

4138
01:49:22,140 --> 01:49:23,660
I think some do take Abbott.

4139
01:49:23,730 --> 01:49:25,740
It comes to mind when I
think of the UFC level,

4140
01:49:25,770 --> 01:49:27,240
maybe there's more of those guys,

4141
01:49:27,241 --> 01:49:28,370
but you know I'm,

4142
01:49:28,371 --> 01:49:28,641
I'm,

4143
01:49:28,641 --> 01:49:30,480
I'm doing this very small time.

4144
01:49:30,481 --> 01:49:33,990
Amateur fighters and western
Pennsylvania and Ohio,

4145
01:49:34,260 --> 01:49:36,090
a 99% of them are amateurs.

4146
01:49:36,120 --> 01:49:40,380
99% of them have no hope of ever
winning any fame or fortune there.

4147
01:49:40,470 --> 01:49:43,050
There is no fame or fortune to be one.

4148
01:49:43,200 --> 01:49:44,070
So why are they doing it?

4149
01:49:44,100 --> 01:49:46,950
They're doing it because they
want a challenge in their,

4150
01:49:47,230 --> 01:49:48,400
they want a quest

4151
01:49:48,640 --> 01:49:51,940
in their life and they want to do battle
with their own weakness in their own

4152
01:49:51,941 --> 01:49:53,440
timidity and tried to defeat it.

4153
01:49:53,610 --> 01:49:56,200
Then you're not dreaming
about hurting people.

4154
01:49:56,260 --> 01:49:57,250
That's the way to express it.

4155
01:49:57,251 --> 01:49:58,660
Do battle with their own weakness.

4156
01:49:58,810 --> 01:49:59,920
That's why we,

4157
01:50:00,190 --> 01:50:01,300
everyone's like,

4158
01:50:01,301 --> 01:50:04,990
we have disdain for people that pick on
folks that they know that they can beat.

4159
01:50:05,470 --> 01:50:09,580
If you see a guy and he's a bully and
he's like a 250 pound guy and he wants to

4160
01:50:09,581 --> 01:50:10,660
fight a hundred pound guy,

4161
01:50:10,930 --> 01:50:11,800
why is you want to do that?

4162
01:50:11,801 --> 01:50:14,290
He wants to do that cause he's scared
of a challenge cause he's a coward.

4163
01:50:14,310 --> 01:50:14,790
Yeah.

4164
01:50:14,790 --> 01:50:17,650
I'll read a 250 pound
man would never want,

4165
01:50:17,651 --> 01:50:21,130
I mean the only time you would threaten
a hundred pound man is that a hundred

4166
01:50:21,130 --> 01:50:23,590
pound man was threatening a hundred
pound woman or something or the other

4167
01:50:23,590 --> 01:50:24,020
hundred pound man.

4168
01:50:24,020 --> 01:50:25,710
You're trying to step
in and keep the peace,

4169
01:50:26,110 --> 01:50:28,300
but when you see a bully look,

4170
01:50:28,301 --> 01:50:31,540
it's one of the most disgusting
characteristics because
we know ultimately it's

4171
01:50:31,541 --> 01:50:32,080
cowardice.

4172
01:50:32,080 --> 01:50:32,400
Cowardice.

4173
01:50:32,400 --> 01:50:36,190
It appears his strength because
they're flaunting their superiority,

4174
01:50:36,550 --> 01:50:37,840
but it's really cowardice.

4175
01:50:37,910 --> 01:50:38,230
Yeah,

4176
01:50:38,230 --> 01:50:41,890
and that's a thing that's going
to come somebody their own size.

4177
01:50:41,920 --> 01:50:42,161
Yeah.

4178
01:50:42,161 --> 01:50:42,401
I mean,

4179
01:50:42,401 --> 01:50:43,060
there was a,

4180
01:50:43,060 --> 01:50:43,990
here's a perfect example,

4181
01:50:43,991 --> 01:50:46,120
there was a fighter
that fell out of a card,

4182
01:50:46,330 --> 01:50:47,060
um,

4183
01:50:47,060 --> 01:50:50,680
cause he got injured and they offered
this other fighter replacement and he

4184
01:50:50,681 --> 01:50:50,891
said,

4185
01:50:50,891 --> 01:50:51,101
no,

4186
01:50:51,101 --> 01:50:52,150
I don't want to fight that guy.

4187
01:50:52,151 --> 01:50:56,890
But then he listed off a bunch of guys
that he would fight that we're like way

4188
01:50:56,891 --> 01:50:57,730
below him.

4189
01:50:57,731 --> 01:50:58,470
Yeah.

4190
01:50:58,470 --> 01:50:58,891
You know,

4191
01:50:58,891 --> 01:50:59,270
I mean,

4192
01:50:59,270 --> 01:50:59,800
and his,

4193
01:50:59,800 --> 01:51:00,551
his idea was like,

4194
01:51:00,551 --> 01:51:00,791
hey,

4195
01:51:00,791 --> 01:51:03,010
I have to change a
opponents and four weeks.

4196
01:51:03,011 --> 01:51:04,540
I don't want it to be difficult.

4197
01:51:05,220 --> 01:51:06,730
And everybody was like big,

4198
01:51:07,960 --> 01:51:09,010
like the mixed martial arts,

4199
01:51:09,011 --> 01:51:09,970
the underground forum.

4200
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,310
It was fucking a wash with people angry.

4201
01:51:12,700 --> 01:51:13,570
And they're right.

4202
01:51:13,640 --> 01:51:14,740
They are right.

4203
01:51:14,741 --> 01:51:15,574
They are right.

4204
01:51:15,760 --> 01:51:16,091
You know,

4205
01:51:16,091 --> 01:51:20,050
either you are willing to fight another
top contender who's just as capable of

4206
01:51:20,051 --> 01:51:21,790
beating you as you are of him.

4207
01:51:21,820 --> 01:51:23,980
Or we're wasting fucking time here,

4208
01:51:24,480 --> 01:51:24,730
you know?

4209
01:51:24,730 --> 01:51:26,050
And we don't want to watch that.

4210
01:51:26,110 --> 01:51:28,570
You've got to understand like
what did you sign up to do?

4211
01:51:28,580 --> 01:51:30,430
You signed up to be a fucking gladiator.

4212
01:51:30,460 --> 01:51:31,000
Okay.

4213
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:36,000
You signed up to be the most noble of
all martial arts combatants of all time.

4214
01:51:36,760 --> 01:51:39,970
You're competing at the highest level
we've ever achieved in Marshall,

4215
01:51:39,971 --> 01:51:40,481
like today.

4216
01:51:40,481 --> 01:51:41,560
Make no mistake about it.

4217
01:51:41,740 --> 01:51:45,010
The fighters of today
are the highest skilled,

4218
01:51:45,190 --> 01:51:48,970
the most competent martial
artists that have ever existed.

4219
01:51:49,330 --> 01:51:52,180
There's some been some great
judo because of the past.

4220
01:51:52,450 --> 01:51:56,530
There's been some great
taekwondo competitors and
great Moitai fighters has been

4221
01:51:56,531 --> 01:51:57,250
great fun.

4222
01:51:57,250 --> 01:52:01,810
But as far as like the overall combination
in the form of a mixed martial artist

4223
01:52:01,811 --> 01:52:02,560
today,

4224
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:04,090
they're the best that they've ever been.

4225
01:52:04,210 --> 01:52:05,140
No doubt about it.

4226
01:52:05,141 --> 01:52:07,210
I've by orders of magnitude.

4227
01:52:07,240 --> 01:52:07,451
Yeah.

4228
01:52:07,451 --> 01:52:07,721
I mean,

4229
01:52:07,721 --> 01:52:08,860
I'm a student of this.

4230
01:52:08,860 --> 01:52:09,670
I mean a long,

4231
01:52:09,670 --> 01:52:10,990
a lifelong student.

4232
01:52:11,200 --> 01:52:14,980
I've been deeply involved in
martial arts and I was 14 years old,

4233
01:52:15,220 --> 01:52:16,011
so I,

4234
01:52:16,011 --> 01:52:16,221
I'm,

4235
01:52:16,221 --> 01:52:17,410
I've seen all the levels.

4236
01:52:17,411 --> 01:52:18,430
I've seen the difference.

4237
01:52:19,300 --> 01:52:24,300
There's a difference between someone who
is doing it to achieve greatness and a

4238
01:52:24,551 --> 01:52:28,510
difference to someone who's like barely
getting by and they're really physically

4239
01:52:28,511 --> 01:52:31,360
talented and they train really hard,

4240
01:52:31,361 --> 01:52:33,670
but they're fucking terrified
of a real challenge.

4241
01:52:34,030 --> 01:52:37,690
And those guys exist and they exist even
at a very high level because they're

4242
01:52:37,691 --> 01:52:37,960
coming,

4243
01:52:37,960 --> 01:52:39,070
they come from really good camps,

4244
01:52:39,071 --> 01:52:40,150
they're really well trained.

4245
01:52:40,151 --> 01:52:40,780
And they have,

4246
01:52:40,780 --> 01:52:41,200
you know,

4247
01:52:41,200 --> 01:52:42,700
they have a bunch of
success under their belt,

4248
01:52:42,850 --> 01:52:44,030
but they're always terrified.

4249
01:52:44,070 --> 01:52:45,560
The one guy who is going to expose them.

4250
01:52:45,790 --> 01:52:46,040
It's

4251
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:47,780
one of the most fascinating aspects.

4252
01:52:48,190 --> 01:52:49,820
It's also bad business to lose.

4253
01:52:50,150 --> 01:52:50,690
Yes.

4254
01:52:50,690 --> 01:52:50,931
You know,

4255
01:52:50,931 --> 01:52:51,010
it's,

4256
01:52:51,010 --> 01:52:51,960
those boxers you know,

4257
01:52:51,961 --> 01:52:52,330
are,

4258
01:52:52,330 --> 01:52:55,730
are notorious for padding their
records and fighting tomato cans.

4259
01:52:55,731 --> 01:52:56,900
And there's also,

4260
01:52:57,140 --> 01:52:59,240
there's some guys that
fold under pressure.

4261
01:52:59,241 --> 01:53:01,700
It's one of the most impressive
things about Jon Jones.

4262
01:53:02,300 --> 01:53:02,960
Um,

4263
01:53:02,960 --> 01:53:07,610
is it Jon Jones has overcome
adversity in his career in a,

4264
01:53:07,611 --> 01:53:08,480
in a very,

4265
01:53:08,570 --> 01:53:11,810
very obvious character defining way.

4266
01:53:11,960 --> 01:53:14,690
Like a good example is
the fight with Gustafson.

4267
01:53:15,080 --> 01:53:17,300
He talked to the people
that are in John's camp.

4268
01:53:17,330 --> 01:53:17,781
They'll tell you,

4269
01:53:17,781 --> 01:53:17,961
like,

4270
01:53:17,961 --> 01:53:20,660
he barely trained for that
fight to barely trained for him.

4271
01:53:20,930 --> 01:53:21,830
But God,

4272
01:53:21,831 --> 01:53:24,230
he did out in those last rounds and,

4273
01:53:24,231 --> 01:53:25,490
and saved his title.

4274
01:53:25,700 --> 01:53:27,770
The Vitor Belfort fight is
another perfect example.

4275
01:53:27,771 --> 01:53:30,380
Veto caught him and out
fucking deep armbar.

4276
01:53:30,650 --> 01:53:32,700
His arm was totally hyperextended.

4277
01:53:32,750 --> 01:53:37,750
99% of the population on
this planet plus who it tap.

4278
01:53:38,180 --> 01:53:39,500
I'm tapping to thinking about it.

4279
01:53:39,560 --> 01:53:40,730
I mean it was fucked up.

4280
01:53:40,731 --> 01:53:40,971
His,

4281
01:53:40,971 --> 01:53:43,610
his elbow was fucked up for
a long time after that too,

4282
01:53:43,850 --> 01:53:46,580
which is one of the reasons why he had
to coach the ultimate fighter and wound

4283
01:53:46,581 --> 01:53:46,731
up,

4284
01:53:46,731 --> 01:53:46,971
you know,

4285
01:53:46,971 --> 01:53:50,720
going through that because he really
couldn't compete is it was jacked.

4286
01:53:50,750 --> 01:53:52,280
His elbow was fucking jagged,

4287
01:53:52,730 --> 01:53:53,600
but he wouldn't have,

4288
01:53:53,750 --> 01:53:55,400
he wouldn't tap and he
went on to win that fight.

4289
01:53:55,401 --> 01:53:56,960
Anyone on the winded by submission,

4290
01:53:57,620 --> 01:54:00,770
he submitted a black belt in
Brazilian Jujitsu in Vito Belfort.

4291
01:54:00,800 --> 01:54:01,310
Yeah.

4292
01:54:01,310 --> 01:54:06,310
I just think that that
quality is something that is
almost impossible to teach.

4293
01:54:07,740 --> 01:54:09,680
Like you either have it or you don't,

4294
01:54:09,710 --> 01:54:12,800
or you maybe you can gain
it if you didn't have it.

4295
01:54:12,801 --> 01:54:16,570
Maybe you can put up these
boundaries in your mind where you,

4296
01:54:16,580 --> 01:54:18,410
you won't quit any more.

4297
01:54:18,470 --> 01:54:20,350
You won't allow you to some,

4298
01:54:20,490 --> 01:54:20,990
some,

4299
01:54:20,990 --> 01:54:21,680
uh,

4300
01:54:21,680 --> 01:54:22,910
native element to it.

4301
01:54:22,910 --> 01:54:23,061
You know,

4302
01:54:23,061 --> 01:54:23,361
some of it,

4303
01:54:23,361 --> 01:54:27,710
some people are born tough and born
with that kind of character horn.

4304
01:54:28,040 --> 01:54:31,040
I think it's developed over the course
of the adversity that you faced in your

4305
01:54:31,041 --> 01:54:31,311
life.

4306
01:54:31,311 --> 01:54:31,880
I think that's right.

4307
01:54:31,880 --> 01:54:32,630
I think that's right.

4308
01:54:32,630 --> 01:54:33,590
But you know,

4309
01:54:33,910 --> 01:54:37,130
that was one of the big findings
for me at the gym is like,

4310
01:54:37,390 --> 01:54:37,551
you know,

4311
01:54:37,551 --> 01:54:38,750
you go into the gym and it's like,

4312
01:54:39,140 --> 01:54:39,500
ah,

4313
01:54:39,500 --> 01:54:41,680
what's a fighter and promote people.

4314
01:54:41,681 --> 01:54:43,460
I think most people
think a fighter is like,

4315
01:54:43,490 --> 01:54:46,790
I dunno person is strong and fit
and has developed this tool kit.

4316
01:54:46,820 --> 01:54:47,080
Uh,

4317
01:54:47,080 --> 01:54:47,230
you know,

4318
01:54:47,230 --> 01:54:49,160
all these sophisticated
techniques and all that stuff,

4319
01:54:49,330 --> 01:54:50,660
but should talk to fighters.

4320
01:54:50,960 --> 01:54:52,230
They don't define a fighter that way.

4321
01:54:52,231 --> 01:54:53,210
It just find it a fighter is,

4322
01:54:53,211 --> 01:54:53,361
you know,

4323
01:54:53,361 --> 01:54:57,800
a person who's really tough and who
will fight and whose game and a fight.

4324
01:54:58,210 --> 01:54:59,043
Um,

4325
01:54:59,090 --> 01:55:03,710
and that was one the thing that I found
sort of interesting going in because one

4326
01:55:03,711 --> 01:55:04,430
of my,

4327
01:55:04,430 --> 01:55:06,440
one of the things I wondered about
was whether I'd be able to do it,

4328
01:55:06,680 --> 01:55:09,020
just go in there and a
square off with people.

4329
01:55:09,020 --> 01:55:10,430
I didn't think I was ever
going to be good at it,

4330
01:55:10,670 --> 01:55:11,700
but could I just kind,

4331
01:55:11,750 --> 01:55:13,770
I compete bravely and I,

4332
01:55:13,771 --> 01:55:17,900
and I do think that you do build
your character by doing it.

4333
01:55:17,930 --> 01:55:18,400
You do get,

4334
01:55:18,400 --> 01:55:21,110
you do get stronger
and tougher and braver,

4335
01:55:21,500 --> 01:55:22,333
um,

4336
01:55:22,370 --> 01:55:23,600
through the process of,

4337
01:55:23,630 --> 01:55:24,463
you know,

4338
01:55:25,040 --> 01:55:25,820
of training?

4339
01:55:25,820 --> 01:55:26,031
No,

4340
01:55:26,031 --> 01:55:26,451
I think so.

4341
01:55:26,451 --> 01:55:28,490
Do I think there's no doubt about that.

4342
01:55:28,550 --> 01:55:29,750
I think there's also,

4343
01:55:29,751 --> 01:55:29,891
it's,

4344
01:55:29,891 --> 01:55:34,891
it's curious to me that there's a bunch
of people that are fight fans that are

4345
01:55:36,020 --> 01:55:40,790
they and even fighters that don't respect
people that don't put themselves at

4346
01:55:40,791 --> 01:55:41,624
risk

4347
01:55:42,770 --> 01:55:44,910
like a Floyd Mayweather
as a perfect example.

4348
01:55:45,360 --> 01:55:46,410
I don't get that at all.

4349
01:55:46,470 --> 01:55:47,430
I don't get it at all either.

4350
01:55:47,431 --> 01:55:49,740
I look at Floyd Mayweather
and I see a genius.

4351
01:55:50,160 --> 01:55:54,120
I see a guy who's obviously troubled in
his personal life and his treatment of

4352
01:55:54,121 --> 01:55:56,190
women is atrocious and all that,

4353
01:55:56,191 --> 01:55:56,910
all of the above.

4354
01:55:56,910 --> 01:55:57,121
I mean,

4355
01:55:57,121 --> 01:55:59,550
he's got all these arrests
for domestic violence.

4356
01:55:59,551 --> 01:55:59,731
I mean,

4357
01:55:59,731 --> 01:56:00,331
where there's smoke,

4358
01:56:00,331 --> 01:56:00,871
there's fire,

4359
01:56:00,871 --> 01:56:01,350
right?

4360
01:56:01,350 --> 01:56:01,501
Oh,

4361
01:56:01,501 --> 01:56:03,520
he spent time in jail for that gotta be,

4362
01:56:03,600 --> 01:56:06,900
or he's hanging out with chicks that
everyone and anyone would smack.

4363
01:56:06,930 --> 01:56:07,860
That's possibility too,

4364
01:56:07,861 --> 01:56:09,930
that nobody wants to
take into consideration.

4365
01:56:10,370 --> 01:56:10,621
I mean,

4366
01:56:10,621 --> 01:56:11,640
you're hanging around with that dude.

4367
01:56:11,700 --> 01:56:11,881
I mean,

4368
01:56:11,881 --> 01:56:13,050
why are you hanging around with that dude?

4369
01:56:13,080 --> 01:56:13,560
I mean,

4370
01:56:13,560 --> 01:56:13,951
you know,

4371
01:56:13,951 --> 01:56:14,131
we,

4372
01:56:14,131 --> 01:56:15,930
you're attracted to him while he's rich.

4373
01:56:15,960 --> 01:56:16,201
Yeah.

4374
01:56:16,201 --> 01:56:17,034
Is that what it is?

4375
01:56:17,340 --> 01:56:18,060
Who knows?

4376
01:56:18,060 --> 01:56:18,690
Who knows what,

4377
01:56:18,690 --> 01:56:19,740
what the variables are?

4378
01:56:19,741 --> 01:56:22,050
But what's undeniable,

4379
01:56:22,140 --> 01:56:22,291
like,

4380
01:56:22,291 --> 01:56:22,891
I don't know him.

4381
01:56:22,891 --> 01:56:24,150
I don't want to judge his character.

4382
01:56:24,180 --> 01:56:29,010
What's undeniable about what
you can view is inside the ring.

4383
01:56:29,100 --> 01:56:30,240
He's a fucking genius.

4384
01:56:30,630 --> 01:56:31,470
He's brilliant.

4385
01:56:31,530 --> 01:56:33,060
The way he gets guys to dance,

4386
01:56:33,061 --> 01:56:33,930
to his tune,

4387
01:56:34,200 --> 01:56:35,850
he slows punchers down.

4388
01:56:35,851 --> 01:56:38,700
He slows volume punches down dramatically.

4389
01:56:38,970 --> 01:56:39,380
He,

4390
01:56:39,380 --> 01:56:40,890
he gets them to second.

4391
01:56:40,890 --> 01:56:41,970
Guess what they're doing.

4392
01:56:41,971 --> 01:56:43,830
He gets them off their game.

4393
01:56:44,190 --> 01:56:45,330
He lights them up,

4394
01:56:45,331 --> 01:56:46,111
he tags them,

4395
01:56:46,111 --> 01:56:46,970
he clinches them.

4396
01:56:46,980 --> 01:56:48,600
He just fights brilliantly.

4397
01:56:48,601 --> 01:56:48,841
He's,

4398
01:56:48,841 --> 01:56:51,840
the whole point of fighting is to
do damage without getting damaged.

4399
01:56:51,990 --> 01:56:53,160
But he doesn't do that much damage.

4400
01:56:53,161 --> 01:56:54,210
That's why people get crazy.

4401
01:56:54,230 --> 01:56:54,391
Yeah.

4402
01:56:54,391 --> 01:56:55,590
He does a little bit of damage,

4403
01:56:55,591 --> 01:56:56,860
but score than anybody else.

4404
01:56:58,080 --> 01:56:59,460
But in doing so,

4405
01:56:59,580 --> 01:57:01,080
he's beat the fucking game.

4406
01:57:01,650 --> 01:57:02,041
I mean,

4407
01:57:02,041 --> 01:57:04,060
he's 48 and oh yeah.

4408
01:57:04,200 --> 01:57:06,120
And he's never been knocked down.

4409
01:57:06,270 --> 01:57:07,560
He's never been stopped.

4410
01:57:07,561 --> 01:57:08,730
He's never been really hurt.

4411
01:57:08,760 --> 01:57:08,971
I said,

4412
01:57:08,971 --> 01:57:09,660
been knocked down.

4413
01:57:09,660 --> 01:57:10,530
Maybe he's been knocked down.

4414
01:57:10,990 --> 01:57:12,570
It might've been knocked down
like early in his career.

4415
01:57:13,220 --> 01:57:14,310
I think people were reacting.

4416
01:57:14,311 --> 01:57:15,870
They're not to the lack of,

4417
01:57:15,900 --> 01:57:16,470
you know,

4418
01:57:16,470 --> 01:57:17,190
carnage.

4419
01:57:17,190 --> 01:57:18,780
I think going back to the lack of drama,

4420
01:57:19,250 --> 01:57:19,410
you know,

4421
01:57:19,410 --> 01:57:19,950
people are,

4422
01:57:19,950 --> 01:57:20,160
you know,

4423
01:57:20,160 --> 01:57:21,870
people are attracted to fighting sports.

4424
01:57:21,871 --> 01:57:22,920
I think for a lot of reasons.

4425
01:57:22,920 --> 01:57:23,430
You know,

4426
01:57:23,430 --> 01:57:26,250
there's probably a creature in
us that kind of likes violence.

4427
01:57:26,730 --> 01:57:27,210
Um,

4428
01:57:27,210 --> 01:57:31,530
but there's also this sort of
a drama to a fight that's hard.

4429
01:57:31,531 --> 01:57:33,450
I mean with that fight
you have these two guys.

4430
01:57:33,451 --> 01:57:34,110
Do you have the,

4431
01:57:34,110 --> 01:57:34,541
you have the,

4432
01:57:34,541 --> 01:57:35,430
you have the good guy,

4433
01:57:35,431 --> 01:57:35,881
you have the,

4434
01:57:35,881 --> 01:57:36,691
you have the face,

4435
01:57:36,691 --> 01:57:40,860
you have the heel squaring off in this
incredibly climactic showdown that's

4436
01:57:40,861 --> 01:57:45,210
going to define the story of their entire
careers and you're expecting some sort

4437
01:57:45,211 --> 01:57:49,860
of epic battle to go down that's
going to be incredibly gripping drama.

4438
01:57:50,220 --> 01:57:53,040
And then as a sort of dramatic spectacle,

4439
01:57:53,041 --> 01:57:56,190
I think it sort of fell flat because why?

4440
01:57:56,790 --> 01:57:59,090
That's my sort of theory for why the,

4441
01:57:59,150 --> 01:57:59,371
the,

4442
01:57:59,371 --> 01:58:01,230
the reaction to the fight was so negative.

4443
01:58:01,800 --> 01:58:02,431
Yeah.

4444
01:58:02,431 --> 01:58:03,241
I guess,

4445
01:58:03,241 --> 01:58:03,720
man,

4446
01:58:03,720 --> 01:58:08,720
I mean just when you're dealing with
two of the best boxers of any generation

4447
01:58:11,580 --> 01:58:12,870
who I think Manny Pacquiao,

4448
01:58:12,900 --> 01:58:15,810
I think it's safe to say that 95% of
them don't know anything about boxing.

4449
01:58:15,960 --> 01:58:16,920
That is a problem.

4450
01:58:16,950 --> 01:58:18,030
Boxing fans,

4451
01:58:18,620 --> 01:58:19,510
that's a Roger Mayweather.

4452
01:58:19,520 --> 01:58:20,850
He says famously it's a quote.

4453
01:58:21,060 --> 01:58:23,850
Most people don't know shit about
Bach ever seen they say that.

4454
01:58:23,851 --> 01:58:24,440
No,

4455
01:58:24,440 --> 01:58:24,871
but it's true.

4456
01:58:24,871 --> 01:58:25,704
It's a medium.

4457
01:58:26,130 --> 01:58:28,080
Anytime there's anything on the,

4458
01:58:28,081 --> 01:58:29,130
on the underground or time,

4459
01:58:29,131 --> 01:58:30,180
people talk about boxing,

4460
01:58:30,360 --> 01:58:32,220
but you're able to appreciate as a,

4461
01:58:32,221 --> 01:58:33,310
as an officiant auto.

4462
01:58:33,350 --> 01:58:33,620
Yeah.

4463
01:58:33,620 --> 01:58:35,970
And somebody is really sophisticated
and your knowledge of the sport,

4464
01:58:35,971 --> 01:58:39,150
whereas most people are just
wanting to see an intense drama.

4465
01:58:39,390 --> 01:58:39,661
Well,

4466
01:58:39,661 --> 01:58:41,190
I watched it with my wife

4467
01:58:42,160 --> 01:58:44,760
has never been in a fight in her life
and doesn't know Jack Shit about psychic.

4468
01:58:44,940 --> 01:58:45,820
It's kind of funny,

4469
01:58:46,180 --> 01:58:46,481
you know,

4470
01:58:46,481 --> 01:58:47,314
because you know,

4471
01:58:47,400 --> 01:58:48,760
if you look at our Dvr,

4472
01:58:48,790 --> 01:58:49,151
it's a,

4473
01:58:49,151 --> 01:58:51,340
it's like two competing philosophies,

4474
01:58:51,820 --> 01:58:54,280
reality shows versus she
doesn't watch reality shows,

4475
01:58:54,281 --> 01:58:54,941
but she's,

4476
01:58:54,941 --> 01:58:55,270
you know,

4477
01:58:55,270 --> 01:58:58,930
she's very much into different
shit that I'm into and I don't,

4478
01:58:59,280 --> 01:59:00,310
I don't mind that.

4479
01:59:00,340 --> 01:59:01,570
I don't and she doesn't mind,

4480
01:59:01,571 --> 01:59:01,700
but I,

4481
01:59:01,700 --> 01:59:06,670
but it's like when our path
or our interests cross and
she watches what I watch,

4482
01:59:06,940 --> 01:59:09,610
WWE becomes hilarious cause she
doesn't know anything about fighting.

4483
01:59:09,611 --> 01:59:10,150
Right.

4484
01:59:10,150 --> 01:59:11,230
She actually said this to me,

4485
01:59:11,231 --> 01:59:13,840
I've said this a bunch of times in the
podcast I promised the last time I say it

4486
01:59:13,841 --> 01:59:14,680
to anybody who's listening.

4487
01:59:14,950 --> 01:59:17,350
She actually says you should have
to get knocked down in order to win.

4488
01:59:17,980 --> 01:59:18,341
And I go,

4489
01:59:18,341 --> 01:59:19,300
what are you talking about?

4490
01:59:19,300 --> 01:59:20,740
She goes with Ellie will
make them fight more.

4491
01:59:20,741 --> 01:59:21,250
I'm like,

4492
01:59:21,250 --> 01:59:22,160
he's fighting.

4493
01:59:22,350 --> 01:59:24,670
Know God damn woman.

4494
01:59:25,020 --> 01:59:27,010
Like you don't understand
what's happening here.

4495
01:59:27,011 --> 01:59:27,844
This guy is,

4496
01:59:27,940 --> 01:59:29,470
he's doing what he wants to do.

4497
01:59:29,471 --> 01:59:33,250
He's if he stood in front
of Manny Pacquiao and they
just went rock 'em sock 'em

4498
01:59:33,251 --> 01:59:35,020
robots with fucking anything can happen.

4499
01:59:35,320 --> 01:59:37,300
But the way he's doing it,

4500
01:59:37,301 --> 01:59:39,970
he's controlling all the variables.

4501
01:59:40,090 --> 01:59:41,020
He's controlling it,

4502
01:59:41,021 --> 01:59:44,050
but he's controlling it with his skill
and his dedication and his practice and

4503
01:59:44,051 --> 01:59:45,360
his knowledge and he's,

4504
01:59:45,420 --> 01:59:47,350
he's information chunking.

4505
01:59:47,680 --> 01:59:47,980
That's,

4506
01:59:47,980 --> 01:59:52,450
that's something that I really truly
appreciate about high level Jujitsu

4507
01:59:52,451 --> 01:59:53,021
artists,

4508
01:59:53,021 --> 01:59:55,330
about high level martial
artists in any venue.

4509
01:59:55,331 --> 01:59:59,050
I love watching people
problem solve in real time,

4510
01:59:59,380 --> 02:00:01,120
much better than anybody else is doing.

4511
02:00:01,640 --> 02:00:02,471
And that's what he does.

4512
02:00:02,471 --> 02:00:05,240
Like he knows like he knows
how you're gonna react to it.

4513
02:00:05,241 --> 02:00:06,040
Thanks pop.

4514
02:00:06,040 --> 02:00:08,500
And it'll like poppy with that jab and
he knows that you're going to look to

4515
02:00:08,501 --> 02:00:10,520
step to your left and
he's already out of there.

4516
02:00:10,960 --> 02:00:14,650
He's already like when many pack yet would
step in and throw that right hook and

4517
02:00:14,651 --> 02:00:18,190
Floyd would dip to his left and
duck and slide right off the ropes.

4518
02:00:18,460 --> 02:00:19,480
It was genius,

4519
02:00:19,630 --> 02:00:20,650
the artistic,

4520
02:00:20,651 --> 02:00:20,891
you know,

4521
02:00:20,891 --> 02:00:22,540
he planned it perfectly.

4522
02:00:22,750 --> 02:00:26,770
He knew the pat cow is a certain type
of blitz style and Floyd just wasn't

4523
02:00:26,771 --> 02:00:26,921
there.

4524
02:00:26,921 --> 02:00:28,720
Still enjoy watching
boxing or do you find it,

4525
02:00:28,770 --> 02:00:29,603
uh,

4526
02:00:29,850 --> 02:00:32,080
kind of boring after watching MMA?

4527
02:00:32,290 --> 02:00:32,770
Um,

4528
02:00:32,770 --> 02:00:33,940
it's not as fun,

4529
02:00:33,941 --> 02:00:35,670
but I still love it like a,

4530
02:00:35,680 --> 02:00:39,490
I really love watching Canelo Alvarez
fight cause it's fights are fucking chaos.

4531
02:00:39,700 --> 02:00:41,560
Gennady Golovkin who funds this weekend,

4532
02:00:41,770 --> 02:00:42,700
he's the best.

4533
02:00:43,090 --> 02:00:45,190
Golovkin is the best to
watch because you know,

4534
02:00:45,191 --> 02:00:46,780
someone's getting knocked the fuck out.

4535
02:00:46,781 --> 02:00:48,700
Like that guy just is a destroyer.

4536
02:00:49,090 --> 02:00:50,560
He just seeks and destroys,

4537
02:00:50,561 --> 02:00:51,700
seeks and destroys.

4538
02:00:51,701 --> 02:00:55,060
And just slowly chips away at the best
of them to the point where they just

4539
02:00:55,061 --> 02:00:57,250
can't take it anymore and
their body starts giving out.

4540
02:00:57,670 --> 02:00:58,181
He's amazing.

4541
02:00:58,181 --> 02:00:58,301
You know,

4542
02:00:58,301 --> 02:01:02,380
he's had 300 and fucking 50 something
fights when you count his amateur career.

4543
02:01:02,410 --> 02:01:02,760
Wow.

4544
02:01:02,760 --> 02:01:03,460
He's amazing.

4545
02:01:03,460 --> 02:01:04,000
That's amazing.

4546
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:04,151
Yeah.

4547
02:01:04,151 --> 02:01:05,140
Never been knocked down.

4548
02:01:05,141 --> 02:01:05,801
Never been dropped.

4549
02:01:05,801 --> 02:01:06,520
Never been hurt.

4550
02:01:06,520 --> 02:01:08,840
And he's knocked out every one.

4551
02:01:09,290 --> 02:01:09,790
I mean,

4552
02:01:09,790 --> 02:01:10,623
and you look at him,

4553
02:01:10,660 --> 02:01:12,160
he looks like he's in a boy band.

4554
02:01:12,600 --> 02:01:13,433
Little Sweetie.

4555
02:01:13,630 --> 02:01:14,381
Look at his face.

4556
02:01:14,381 --> 02:01:16,720
He's got a big smile and the way he talks,

4557
02:01:16,721 --> 02:01:18,580
I bring big drama fight.

4558
02:01:18,700 --> 02:01:19,420
It's amazing.

4559
02:01:19,420 --> 02:01:20,290
I said always amazing me.

4560
02:01:20,291 --> 02:01:24,430
Drama shows sport where one person
is so much better than everyone else.

4561
02:01:24,760 --> 02:01:28,750
It's not Roger Federer in tennis or
it's not necessarily that he is so much

4562
02:01:28,751 --> 02:01:29,584
better than everyone else.

4563
02:01:29,740 --> 02:01:31,420
He's so much better than
everyone he's fought.

4564
02:01:31,630 --> 02:01:34,930
He has to fight a Mayweather or maybe
there's a little smaller than him.

4565
02:01:35,020 --> 02:01:35,853
His father,

4566
02:01:35,980 --> 02:01:37,610
the ways Floyd senior said that.

4567
02:01:37,611 --> 02:01:37,721
Yeah,

4568
02:01:37,721 --> 02:01:39,190
he ain't find no damn giant.

4569
02:01:39,470 --> 02:01:40,310
A giant.

4570
02:01:40,310 --> 02:01:41,850
He's fucking my size.

4571
02:01:41,930 --> 02:01:42,650
It's fun.

4572
02:01:42,650 --> 02:01:43,371
Eight or something,

4573
02:01:43,371 --> 02:01:46,190
or five nine who's not a big guy,

4574
02:01:46,400 --> 02:01:46,821
you know,

4575
02:01:46,821 --> 02:01:48,500
he's just amazing.

4576
02:01:49,010 --> 02:01:51,080
But he's won 60 fights at one 60.

4577
02:01:51,081 --> 02:01:51,291
And me,

4578
02:01:51,291 --> 02:01:52,550
whether it's a one 47.

4579
02:01:52,610 --> 02:01:53,120
Yeah.

4580
02:01:53,120 --> 02:01:54,080
So I kind of get it.

4581
02:01:54,350 --> 02:01:54,651
But,

4582
02:01:54,651 --> 02:01:54,891
uh,

4583
02:01:54,891 --> 02:01:55,850
if Canelo Alvarez,

4584
02:01:55,851 --> 02:01:57,170
I think he's big enough to fight them.

4585
02:01:57,230 --> 02:01:59,550
I think that would be a
fucking fantastic fight.

4586
02:01:59,730 --> 02:02:04,700
God Alvarez and Gennady Golovkin would
be fucking amazing because Alvarez,

4587
02:02:05,030 --> 02:02:05,301
I mean,

4588
02:02:05,301 --> 02:02:06,380
he could knock out anybody.

4589
02:02:06,440 --> 02:02:06,650
Yeah.

4590
02:02:06,650 --> 02:02:07,340
Anybody.

4591
02:02:07,340 --> 02:02:08,540
And so can glove gun.

4592
02:02:08,541 --> 02:02:10,940
I think Golovkin is a bit
more skilled than him.

4593
02:02:11,330 --> 02:02:12,080
A bit more,

4594
02:02:12,080 --> 02:02:14,210
more refined and more technical.

4595
02:02:14,211 --> 02:02:16,250
But Khan Damn Alvarez
is a fucking monster.

4596
02:02:16,520 --> 02:02:17,353
He's a monster.

4597
02:02:17,480 --> 02:02:18,313
That would be exciting.

4598
02:02:18,710 --> 02:02:19,071
You know,

4599
02:02:19,071 --> 02:02:23,870
a survey called Kovalev is another really
exciting guy and he's Russian dudes

4600
02:02:23,871 --> 02:02:25,250
are not regular white people.

4601
02:02:25,760 --> 02:02:27,320
They just are not so true.

4602
02:02:27,650 --> 02:02:29,300
We need to get that in our head folks.

4603
02:02:29,760 --> 02:02:31,790
He let these guys turn Europeans.

4604
02:02:31,870 --> 02:02:32,290
Uh,

4605
02:02:32,290 --> 02:02:32,501
you know,

4606
02:02:32,501 --> 02:02:37,370
it was coming from hardscrabble
backgrounds and how about
fucking thousand years

4607
02:02:37,371 --> 02:02:38,760
of hard scrabble genetics.

4608
02:02:39,080 --> 02:02:39,700
That's right.

4609
02:02:39,700 --> 02:02:40,040
That's right.

4610
02:02:40,040 --> 02:02:40,580
Yeah.

4611
02:02:40,580 --> 02:02:42,380
And not these pussy Americans.

4612
02:02:42,390 --> 02:02:43,910
We're dealing with Bella tour.

4613
02:02:43,930 --> 02:02:45,470
A bunch of tough Russians.

4614
02:02:45,560 --> 02:02:45,801
Fuck.

4615
02:02:45,801 --> 02:02:45,951
Yeah,

4616
02:02:45,951 --> 02:02:46,784
they do.

4617
02:02:46,910 --> 02:02:47,330
Sure.

4618
02:02:47,330 --> 02:02:48,530
Manco who's that Little Chi?

4619
02:02:48,531 --> 02:02:48,880
Uh,

4620
02:02:48,880 --> 02:02:50,570
the fade or not fade or
what do they call him?

4621
02:02:51,050 --> 02:02:52,010
The Lord of Frodo.

4622
02:02:52,300 --> 02:02:53,240
You ever seen him fight?

4623
02:02:53,360 --> 02:02:53,900
Oh yeah.

4624
02:02:53,900 --> 02:02:54,750
What the fuck is his knees?

4625
02:02:54,760 --> 02:02:55,570
A little,

4626
02:02:55,570 --> 02:02:55,700
well,

4627
02:02:55,700 --> 02:02:59,120
there's a bunch of really high level
Russian guys that are in the UFC now too.

4628
02:02:59,121 --> 02:03:00,800
Like a hubby even number got met off.

4629
02:03:00,830 --> 02:03:01,211
Yeah,

4630
02:03:01,211 --> 02:03:02,570
it was another Aka guy.

4631
02:03:03,240 --> 02:03:04,200
But you know,

4632
02:03:04,340 --> 02:03:07,640
I watched a video of him wrestling
Luke Rockhold and I'm like,

4633
02:03:07,641 --> 02:03:11,810
how come a fucking guy who fights at
one 55 is fighting the biggest one?

4634
02:03:11,811 --> 02:03:15,590
Eight F is wrestling the biggest 185
pounds of the world's ever known.

4635
02:03:16,010 --> 02:03:16,843
What is going on in there?

4636
02:03:17,180 --> 02:03:18,380
Does he wrestle cane too?

4637
02:03:18,410 --> 02:03:18,990
I mean what,

4638
02:03:18,990 --> 02:03:19,340
when,

4639
02:03:19,340 --> 02:03:19,970
how?

4640
02:03:19,970 --> 02:03:21,540
Cause I know that Rockhold wrestles came.

4641
02:03:21,560 --> 02:03:21,860
Yeah.

4642
02:03:21,860 --> 02:03:22,960
Where do you guys end us?

4643
02:03:23,320 --> 02:03:24,580
Cause he spar with DC.

4644
02:03:24,590 --> 02:03:25,880
I mean he's won 55.

4645
02:03:25,881 --> 02:03:26,990
What the fuck is going on?

4646
02:03:27,410 --> 02:03:30,320
So he blew out his knee
again and you know,

4647
02:03:30,390 --> 02:03:33,560
he's supposed to be fighting
cowboy in my fight of the year.

4648
02:03:33,590 --> 02:03:35,060
I fucking love that fight.

4649
02:03:35,090 --> 02:03:35,690
Yeah.

4650
02:03:35,690 --> 02:03:36,523
Ooh,

4651
02:03:37,310 --> 02:03:38,750
that's a stylistic fight.

4652
02:03:38,751 --> 02:03:43,150
I mean [inaudible] you got the best
grappler I think in the division in Habib

4653
02:03:43,730 --> 02:03:47,360
versus one of the very best
strikers and all of the UFC.

4654
02:03:47,770 --> 02:03:47,991
I mean,

4655
02:03:47,991 --> 02:03:49,940
Donald is such a good morning tie striker.

4656
02:03:49,941 --> 02:03:50,930
He's so good.

4657
02:03:51,290 --> 02:03:52,123
He's so good at,

4658
02:03:52,200 --> 02:03:52,550
I mean you,

4659
02:03:52,550 --> 02:03:56,360
when you see him fight a guy
that is not at his level,

4660
02:03:56,361 --> 02:03:59,180
that's when you really understand how
good he is and you see him fight like a

4661
02:03:59,180 --> 02:04:00,680
Jim Miller and see what
he could do to those guys.

4662
02:04:00,980 --> 02:04:02,090
That's where you kind of get in your head.

4663
02:04:02,091 --> 02:04:02,301
You're like,

4664
02:04:02,301 --> 02:04:02,521
wow,

4665
02:04:02,521 --> 02:04:03,320
this guy's on.

4666
02:04:03,320 --> 02:04:04,850
He's on a very high level right now.

4667
02:04:04,851 --> 02:04:05,291
Something.

4668
02:04:05,291 --> 02:04:05,540
Yeah,

4669
02:04:05,540 --> 02:04:07,190
it's also super confident.

4670
02:04:07,460 --> 02:04:09,350
Super prepared.

4671
02:04:09,470 --> 02:04:13,490
He's been fighting so often and he's
like just in the groove right now.

4672
02:04:13,491 --> 02:04:16,670
This is his time trying to bulletproof.

4673
02:04:16,671 --> 02:04:17,001
I mean,

4674
02:04:17,001 --> 02:04:20,030
he fights so much and you fight
so hard and it's tough as shit,

4675
02:04:20,031 --> 02:04:20,420
man.

4676
02:04:20,420 --> 02:04:21,380
He just holds up.

4677
02:04:22,130 --> 02:04:22,401
He,

4678
02:04:22,401 --> 02:04:22,851
you know,

4679
02:04:22,851 --> 02:04:23,990
he's just tough as shit.

4680
02:04:24,050 --> 02:04:25,400
That's just like who he is.

4681
02:04:25,401 --> 02:04:26,360
He's the real deal.

4682
02:04:26,390 --> 02:04:26,691
I mean,

4683
02:04:26,691 --> 02:04:27,800
that guy in his spare time,

4684
02:04:27,801 --> 02:04:28,634
he rides bulls,

4685
02:04:29,310 --> 02:04:30,870
gets on fucking bowls and rides him.

4686
02:04:30,890 --> 02:04:31,151
He just,

4687
02:04:31,151 --> 02:04:31,820
he jumps,

4688
02:04:31,820 --> 02:04:33,740
he keeps the most dangerous
sport in the world by the way.

4689
02:04:33,741 --> 02:04:34,520
But it's not as bold.

4690
02:04:34,520 --> 02:04:35,780
That's just people being assholes.

4691
02:04:36,830 --> 02:04:37,980
You get call it a support.

4692
02:04:37,981 --> 02:04:38,910
This is ridiculous.

4693
02:04:38,940 --> 02:04:42,150
It was a great article in the New Yorker
about bull riding and it's amazing.

4694
02:04:42,180 --> 02:04:42,391
It's,

4695
02:04:42,391 --> 02:04:44,220
it'd be a sport of the
bull signed up for it.

4696
02:04:44,280 --> 02:04:44,791
If the bowls,

4697
02:04:44,791 --> 02:04:45,000
what?

4698
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:45,241
Yeah.

4699
02:04:45,241 --> 02:04:45,451
Man.

4700
02:04:45,451 --> 02:04:47,250
I want to see if I can
fucking shake a dude.

4701
02:04:47,280 --> 02:04:48,510
They breed these bolts out.

4702
02:04:48,511 --> 02:04:49,470
They breed them to shake.

4703
02:04:49,471 --> 02:04:50,640
They breed would be violent.

4704
02:04:50,641 --> 02:04:51,890
They breed be dangerous.

4705
02:04:51,960 --> 02:04:52,800
Of course they do.

4706
02:04:52,860 --> 02:04:53,341
And they,

4707
02:04:53,341 --> 02:04:53,730
uh,

4708
02:04:53,730 --> 02:04:53,990
and the,

4709
02:04:53,990 --> 02:04:55,320
the highest rate of head injuries,

4710
02:04:55,321 --> 02:04:56,220
neck injuries.

4711
02:04:56,660 --> 02:04:59,360
We had a guy on fire for
injuries that had his,

4712
02:04:59,380 --> 02:05:02,460
his elbow or shoulder
rather just destroyed.

4713
02:05:02,461 --> 02:05:05,970
He was a professional bull rider and he
showed me a scar is I get took off his

4714
02:05:05,971 --> 02:05:08,520
shirt and his whole like is,

4715
02:05:08,710 --> 02:05:13,710
is he had like lines everywhere
connecting his shoulder to his,

4716
02:05:13,951 --> 02:05:15,140
his jigsaw puzzle.

4717
02:05:15,870 --> 02:05:19,290
How many times he had surgery and he had
some fucking ungodly number of shoulder

4718
02:05:19,291 --> 02:05:19,651
soldier.

4719
02:05:19,651 --> 02:05:20,221
I don't even remember,

4720
02:05:20,221 --> 02:05:22,440
like nine or 10 and he goes,

4721
02:05:22,450 --> 02:05:23,370
anything goes wrong.

4722
02:05:23,370 --> 02:05:24,210
It just pops out.

4723
02:05:24,570 --> 02:05:25,750
Like if he falls wrong,

4724
02:05:25,751 --> 02:05:28,140
which is pops out and then I
need someone to like Yank on it.

4725
02:05:28,370 --> 02:05:28,610
Yeah,

4726
02:05:28,610 --> 02:05:31,560
I guess you got to extend
it in a pop back in place

4727
02:05:34,410 --> 02:05:38,730
and all for what to so he can get that
eight seconds on a monster and hot.

4728
02:05:38,731 --> 02:05:39,401
The same thing.

4729
02:05:39,401 --> 02:05:39,690
I tell him,

4730
02:05:39,690 --> 02:05:39,961
man,

4731
02:05:39,961 --> 02:05:40,171
you know,

4732
02:05:40,171 --> 02:05:42,000
it seems crazy to people from the outside,

4733
02:05:42,001 --> 02:05:43,650
but there's a certain challenge to it.

4734
02:05:43,651 --> 02:05:44,640
There's a quest to it.

4735
02:05:44,790 --> 02:05:46,530
I would hop in array.

4736
02:05:46,560 --> 02:05:48,510
I would agree to three
fights in the night before.

4737
02:05:48,511 --> 02:05:49,470
I would agree to ride a bull.

4738
02:05:50,190 --> 02:05:51,023
No doubt about it.

4739
02:05:51,090 --> 02:05:52,230
When you're fucking doubt about it,

4740
02:05:52,520 --> 02:05:54,420
you're not very good
at writing good at it.

4741
02:05:54,630 --> 02:05:55,150
The best,

4742
02:05:55,150 --> 02:05:57,240
the best guy could do eight seconds.

4743
02:05:57,241 --> 02:05:58,100
Did you fucking do?

4744
02:05:58,140 --> 02:05:59,520
Everybody sucks it riding bulls.

4745
02:05:59,760 --> 02:06:02,340
If there was a dude out there that was
like the Michael Jordan of bull riding,

4746
02:06:02,470 --> 02:06:04,350
they could just ride bulls
for like a half an hour.

4747
02:06:04,350 --> 02:06:05,730
They're just kicking him
and shit and he's like,

4748
02:06:05,731 --> 02:06:06,460
what?

4749
02:06:06,460 --> 02:06:06,910
You know,

4750
02:06:06,910 --> 02:06:08,760
he's like blowing kisses
to his mom in the crowd.

4751
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:12,390
Then I would say there's a guy that's
good at bull riding but everybody sucks.

4752
02:06:12,660 --> 02:06:14,940
It's just some guy saw that less.

4753
02:06:14,970 --> 02:06:16,210
I'm pretty good at regular blue line.

4754
02:06:16,920 --> 02:06:19,680
I was at this fair one time and uh,

4755
02:06:19,800 --> 02:06:22,220
they had one was mechanical
bowls and everybody's riding,

4756
02:06:22,280 --> 02:06:22,650
you know,

4757
02:06:22,650 --> 02:06:23,940
doing it right the one hand away.

4758
02:06:23,990 --> 02:06:24,571
I'm like fuck it,

4759
02:06:24,571 --> 02:06:24,930
I'm gonna,

4760
02:06:24,930 --> 02:06:25,320
I'm gonna,

4761
02:06:25,320 --> 02:06:27,080
I'm gonna beat this thing and I just,

4762
02:06:27,150 --> 02:06:27,983
I just clench.

4763
02:06:28,080 --> 02:06:30,030
I could on two hands,

4764
02:06:30,031 --> 02:06:30,750
hold onto it,

4765
02:06:30,750 --> 02:06:32,130
bury my face into it and its,

4766
02:06:32,131 --> 02:06:32,641
hold on,

4767
02:06:32,641 --> 02:06:33,000
you know,

4768
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:33,470
how was that?

4769
02:06:33,470 --> 02:06:33,810
Hold on.

4770
02:06:33,810 --> 02:06:35,160
I wrote for like two minutes.

4771
02:06:36,020 --> 02:06:37,890
How wild have people booed me,

4772
02:06:37,910 --> 02:06:38,100
you know,

4773
02:06:38,100 --> 02:06:38,700
for cheating.

4774
02:06:38,700 --> 02:06:39,690
And the other half were like,

4775
02:06:39,980 --> 02:06:40,910
I never thought I got that.

4776
02:06:40,911 --> 02:06:41,580
Got the genius.

4777
02:06:41,580 --> 02:06:43,410
So you grab it like a rear naked choke.

4778
02:06:43,500 --> 02:06:44,071
You grab it.

4779
02:06:44,071 --> 02:06:44,221
Yeah.

4780
02:06:44,221 --> 02:06:46,950
Like you're like you're pulling
guard as hard as you possibly can.

4781
02:06:47,010 --> 02:06:47,820
But wait a minute.

4782
02:06:47,820 --> 02:06:48,061
Okay,

4783
02:06:48,061 --> 02:06:48,630
let me think.

4784
02:06:48,630 --> 02:06:49,680
You seen him mechanical ball,

4785
02:06:50,010 --> 02:06:50,970
but where are you grabbing it?

4786
02:06:51,030 --> 02:06:52,440
You can just kind of grab around.

4787
02:06:52,441 --> 02:06:54,330
It's like you pull a picture
of a mechanical bullet please.

4788
02:06:54,720 --> 02:06:56,670
A pommel horse in gymnastics.

4789
02:06:56,880 --> 02:06:58,380
You're the pommel horse in gymnastics.

4790
02:06:58,540 --> 02:06:59,373
Trying to like that.

4791
02:06:59,660 --> 02:07:02,010
You can just kind of get under
it with both of your hands.

4792
02:07:02,011 --> 02:07:03,150
You put your face into it.

4793
02:07:03,420 --> 02:07:07,290
I'm a very curious now because I rode
one of those things for some stupid MTV

4794
02:07:07,291 --> 02:07:10,860
thing and I was shocked at how
easy it was to them to fly me off.

4795
02:07:10,870 --> 02:07:11,461
That fucker.

4796
02:07:11,461 --> 02:07:13,050
I hadn't any last five seconds.

4797
02:07:13,051 --> 02:07:14,100
I wrote for like two minutes.

4798
02:07:14,130 --> 02:07:14,963
That's insane.

4799
02:07:15,730 --> 02:07:17,070
Oh there's a bunch of different kinds.

4800
02:07:17,071 --> 02:07:17,670
Huh?

4801
02:07:17,670 --> 02:07:19,860
Some of them actually
looked like a real cow.

4802
02:07:19,890 --> 02:07:20,760
I wrote the cow kind.

4803
02:07:20,820 --> 02:07:21,810
The one that looks like a cow.

4804
02:07:22,050 --> 02:07:23,130
Did it have horns or no,

4805
02:07:23,220 --> 02:07:23,960
I don't think he had horns.

4806
02:07:23,960 --> 02:07:24,721
We had rubber horns,

4807
02:07:24,721 --> 02:07:25,080
but I could,

4808
02:07:25,080 --> 02:07:28,760
I could get right around
his head cause a real horns.

4809
02:07:28,810 --> 02:07:29,643
That was,

4810
02:07:30,470 --> 02:07:30,900
um,

4811
02:07:30,900 --> 02:07:31,171
okay,

4812
02:07:31,171 --> 02:07:32,060
so you can get you out one.

4813
02:07:32,061 --> 02:07:32,591
That one right there.

4814
02:07:32,591 --> 02:07:33,270
I see that one with,

4815
02:07:33,270 --> 02:07:35,800
with the fair where they
have the bubble around it.

4816
02:07:35,801 --> 02:07:36,190
You know the,

4817
02:07:36,190 --> 02:07:36,670
that right there.

4818
02:07:36,670 --> 02:07:36,881
Yeah,

4819
02:07:36,881 --> 02:07:37,211
that one.

4820
02:07:37,211 --> 02:07:37,961
Then I could click on that.

4821
02:07:37,961 --> 02:07:38,794
That's when I wrote,

4822
02:07:39,420 --> 02:07:40,570
you can just get him around the neck.

4823
02:07:40,630 --> 02:07:41,560
You kind of choke them out.

4824
02:07:41,660 --> 02:07:42,030
Huh?

4825
02:07:42,030 --> 02:07:43,150
You clinch real hard.

4826
02:07:43,360 --> 02:07:43,751
Like he's,

4827
02:07:43,751 --> 02:07:46,150
his head was bigger so you don't know
if you could get around his head.

4828
02:07:46,210 --> 02:07:46,361
Yeah.

4829
02:07:46,361 --> 02:07:47,680
That guy's riding it like a moron.

4830
02:07:47,730 --> 02:07:47,881
Yeah.

4831
02:07:47,881 --> 02:07:51,010
Well that's why they called
the rear naked choke.

4832
02:07:51,011 --> 02:07:51,731
The lion killer.

4833
02:07:51,731 --> 02:07:53,440
They say there's only
one way to kill a lion.

4834
02:07:53,441 --> 02:07:53,951
He got a choke.

4835
02:07:53,951 --> 02:07:54,784
It kind of choke it out.

4836
02:07:55,330 --> 02:07:56,770
Get it back to get it back.

4837
02:07:56,771 --> 02:07:57,130
I think.

4838
02:07:57,130 --> 02:07:59,850
Good luck getting your fucking
arms around the lines neck.

4839
02:07:59,860 --> 02:08:00,341
It's hard to get.

4840
02:08:00,341 --> 02:08:01,600
Your alarms are how big guys?

4841
02:08:01,620 --> 02:08:01,790
No,

4842
02:08:01,790 --> 02:08:02,060
I know.

4843
02:08:02,060 --> 02:08:02,410
Yeah.

4844
02:08:02,410 --> 02:08:03,221
Get your arms here.

4845
02:08:03,221 --> 02:08:04,330
Those guys that I could,

4846
02:08:04,350 --> 02:08:05,070
I can't choke.

4847
02:08:05,070 --> 02:08:05,301
Yeah,

4848
02:08:05,301 --> 02:08:07,150
I mean you could,

4849
02:08:07,240 --> 02:08:08,320
but it's not easy.

4850
02:08:08,590 --> 02:08:10,840
But a lion is strong as fuck.

4851
02:08:10,840 --> 02:08:13,510
They weigh 500 pounds in a bowl,

4852
02:08:13,660 --> 02:08:13,831
so,

4853
02:08:13,831 --> 02:08:14,081
okay,

4854
02:08:14,081 --> 02:08:16,840
so you reach under and what are
you grabbing with your arms?

4855
02:08:16,870 --> 02:08:17,230
Well,

4856
02:08:17,230 --> 02:08:17,501
again,

4857
02:08:17,501 --> 02:08:18,430
his neck is too big,

4858
02:08:18,431 --> 02:08:20,050
but it's an action in his
neck was a little smaller.

4859
02:08:20,051 --> 02:08:21,330
And just get your arms around his neck.

4860
02:08:21,331 --> 02:08:22,210
Do you ask grip it?

4861
02:08:22,450 --> 02:08:23,283
I think I did.

4862
02:08:23,290 --> 02:08:26,620
I did something like that probably
so it was a small mechanical bull.

4863
02:08:26,621 --> 02:08:27,570
He might his bitch ass.

4864
02:08:28,330 --> 02:08:29,180
He was killing her fluff.

4865
02:08:29,181 --> 02:08:30,430
You were riding a mechanical cow.

4866
02:08:30,431 --> 02:08:33,610
So I'm like a calf maybe they feel
this is one of my best moments.

4867
02:08:34,210 --> 02:08:35,590
I don't have any moments of Vixxo.

4868
02:08:35,591 --> 02:08:36,670
People booed you.

4869
02:08:36,820 --> 02:08:38,230
Half of them booed me for cheating,

4870
02:08:38,260 --> 02:08:38,501
you know,

4871
02:08:38,501 --> 02:08:42,580
because it was obviously like counter
to the spirit of it broke the code.

4872
02:08:42,581 --> 02:08:43,414
He figured it out.

4873
02:08:43,690 --> 02:08:44,980
But it was tough though.

4874
02:08:44,981 --> 02:08:47,650
I mean my face was all like a cut out.

4875
02:08:47,720 --> 02:08:47,990
Yeah.

4876
02:08:47,990 --> 02:08:49,810
You get anything out of it or just pride?

4877
02:08:50,050 --> 02:08:51,050
I got probably got a lot of pride out.

4878
02:08:51,060 --> 02:08:52,210
I'm telling you about it on the air.

4879
02:08:52,211 --> 02:08:53,044
This was my big moment.

4880
02:08:54,760 --> 02:08:54,971
Yeah.

4881
02:08:54,971 --> 02:08:57,220
The idea of riding a giant animal.

4882
02:08:57,221 --> 02:08:58,054
First of all,

4883
02:08:58,990 --> 02:09:02,680
I don't like the idea of
raising those things to do that.

4884
02:09:03,100 --> 02:09:03,581
I don't like,

4885
02:09:03,581 --> 02:09:04,510
I don't even like zoos,

4886
02:09:04,511 --> 02:09:04,751
man.

4887
02:09:04,751 --> 02:09:06,340
I go to zoos and it drives me nuts.

4888
02:09:06,700 --> 02:09:07,331
Bull fighting.

4889
02:09:07,331 --> 02:09:07,901
I don't know if it's,

4890
02:09:07,901 --> 02:09:10,080
I don't know if it's bad.

4891
02:09:10,090 --> 02:09:10,900
More fucked up.

4892
02:09:10,900 --> 02:09:11,250
Both hands.

4893
02:09:11,250 --> 02:09:13,660
Way More fucked up cause I don't think
there's anything bad that really happens

4894
02:09:13,661 --> 02:09:14,021
to the boy.

4895
02:09:14,021 --> 02:09:17,680
He didn't like cause people on his back
and he bucks him off ferociously and

4896
02:09:17,681 --> 02:09:20,410
they're only on there for eight seconds
and some of these bowls are smart and

4897
02:09:20,411 --> 02:09:22,120
they figured out how to hurt people.

4898
02:09:22,370 --> 02:09:23,201
Like they know if they,

4899
02:09:23,201 --> 02:09:26,560
if they buck and just a certain way while
throwing their head back at the same

4900
02:09:26,561 --> 02:09:27,280
time,

4901
02:09:27,280 --> 02:09:29,620
you know they can really do damage to
people and get these people off their

4902
02:09:29,621 --> 02:09:30,040
back.

4903
02:09:30,040 --> 02:09:31,090
Jesus Christ.

4904
02:09:31,170 --> 02:09:33,730
Some of them are basically killers and
they have to be retired because they get

4905
02:09:33,731 --> 02:09:34,564
too good at it.

4906
02:09:35,770 --> 02:09:36,640
It's article in the New Yorker,

4907
02:09:36,641 --> 02:09:36,761
man.

4908
02:09:36,761 --> 02:09:38,640
I'm not telling you Google
New Yorker in both fighting.

4909
02:09:38,650 --> 02:09:39,700
It's amazing article.

4910
02:09:39,910 --> 02:09:41,870
Both fighting boom.

4911
02:09:42,240 --> 02:09:42,990
Right?

4912
02:09:42,990 --> 02:09:43,540
Yeah,

4913
02:09:43,540 --> 02:09:44,201
both fighting.

4914
02:09:44,201 --> 02:09:45,860
I'm hugely opposed to,

4915
02:09:45,910 --> 02:09:46,330
yeah,

4916
02:09:46,330 --> 02:09:47,500
that drives me crazy.

4917
02:09:47,590 --> 02:09:48,250
I just,

4918
02:09:48,250 --> 02:09:48,761
first of all,

4919
02:09:48,761 --> 02:09:52,150
there's a bunch of people sticking that
thing with poisoned arrows are poison

4920
02:09:52,151 --> 02:09:54,110
darts poisoned,

4921
02:09:55,450 --> 02:09:56,140
poisoned.

4922
02:09:56,140 --> 02:10:01,060
I mean it's barbaric but there's one of
the great books about combat sport is

4923
02:10:01,061 --> 02:10:02,800
Hemingway's death in the afternoon.

4924
02:10:02,801 --> 02:10:03,431
If you haven't read that,

4925
02:10:03,431 --> 02:10:07,450
I'd really recommend it because almost
everything he says about bull fighting,

4926
02:10:07,530 --> 02:10:07,960
uh,

4927
02:10:07,960 --> 02:10:09,910
is re relevant,

4928
02:10:09,940 --> 02:10:10,331
you know,

4929
02:10:10,331 --> 02:10:12,910
to other forms of combat sport.

4930
02:10:12,940 --> 02:10:13,091
You know,

4931
02:10:13,091 --> 02:10:13,600
it's really,

4932
02:10:13,600 --> 02:10:14,433
really a great book.

4933
02:10:15,010 --> 02:10:16,420
They had some sort of poison,

4934
02:10:16,421 --> 02:10:18,190
they using those spears and the Jab.

4935
02:10:18,670 --> 02:10:19,361
I don't believe so.

4936
02:10:19,361 --> 02:10:19,441
The,

4937
02:10:19,441 --> 02:10:19,591
the,

4938
02:10:19,591 --> 02:10:21,040
the spears are basically what they do.

4939
02:10:21,041 --> 02:10:21,241
They,

4940
02:10:21,241 --> 02:10:23,860
they drain energy from
the animal and they also,

4941
02:10:23,970 --> 02:10:25,930
and they also force it
to put his head down.

4942
02:10:26,610 --> 02:10:27,070
Um,

4943
02:10:27,070 --> 02:10:30,250
and that's important because the killing
stroke needs to be delivered over the

4944
02:10:30,251 --> 02:10:31,084
horns.

4945
02:10:31,390 --> 02:10:33,980
And so until the,

4946
02:10:34,230 --> 02:10:38,660
what we wanted to have a very
clean balletic a type of kill,

4947
02:10:39,050 --> 02:10:39,620
um,

4948
02:10:39,620 --> 02:10:40,070
which,

4949
02:10:40,070 --> 02:10:42,590
which means that they have to have
to get the animal's head arrange in a

4950
02:10:42,591 --> 02:10:45,200
downward position so they
can get the sword to go home.

4951
02:10:45,230 --> 02:10:46,820
So where are they trying to drive it into?

4952
02:10:46,821 --> 02:10:48,320
It's like a spinal call.

4953
02:10:48,321 --> 02:10:48,951
Like I've seen him do it,

4954
02:10:48,951 --> 02:10:49,311
but no,

4955
02:10:49,311 --> 02:10:50,330
I think to go for the heart.

4956
02:10:50,420 --> 02:10:52,950
But they go in and we'll then go back.

4957
02:10:53,180 --> 02:10:53,870
They go in with a,

4958
02:10:53,870 --> 02:10:54,000
you know,

4959
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:54,471
a two foot,

4960
02:10:54,471 --> 02:10:56,150
three foot sore all the way to the hill.

4961
02:10:56,510 --> 02:10:57,290
Well yeah,

4962
02:10:57,290 --> 02:10:58,340
they're going to go and right to the hill.

4963
02:10:58,370 --> 02:10:59,240
It goes in like butter.

4964
02:11:01,100 --> 02:11:02,150
Jesus Christ.

4965
02:11:02,210 --> 02:11:04,160
Did they eat the bull after they do that?

4966
02:11:04,161 --> 02:11:05,870
Cause bowls are not that delicious.

4967
02:11:05,900 --> 02:11:06,650
Right.

4968
02:11:06,650 --> 02:11:07,520
I have no idea.

4969
02:11:07,550 --> 02:11:08,301
I have no idea.

4970
02:11:08,301 --> 02:11:10,850
I imagine they do it and these are
peasants societies that you know,

4971
02:11:10,910 --> 02:11:11,140
uh,

4972
02:11:11,140 --> 02:11:13,010
develop this custom and I'm sure they,

4973
02:11:13,030 --> 02:11:13,880
they ate the ball.

4974
02:11:14,150 --> 02:11:14,301
Well,

4975
02:11:14,301 --> 02:11:17,810
most people aren't aware that
if you buy steak in a market,

4976
02:11:17,840 --> 02:11:19,670
you're getting an animal
that's been neutered.

4977
02:11:19,990 --> 02:11:20,421
Yeah.

4978
02:11:20,421 --> 02:11:24,260
You get what's called a steer and they
take a bowl and they cut his balls off

4979
02:11:24,261 --> 02:11:27,470
and he's young and they let them
grow to size and then they kill him.

4980
02:11:27,650 --> 02:11:29,120
So he has a more tender meat.

4981
02:11:29,600 --> 02:11:30,110
If you eat,

4982
02:11:30,110 --> 02:11:31,910
like I shot a moose in,

4983
02:11:31,911 --> 02:11:32,600
um,

4984
02:11:32,600 --> 02:11:34,190
this guy right here in British Columbia.

4985
02:11:34,220 --> 02:11:34,730
That's him.

4986
02:11:34,730 --> 02:11:35,100
Yeah.

4987
02:11:35,100 --> 02:11:36,590
This monkey boil his face.

4988
02:11:36,830 --> 02:11:37,191
Yeah.

4989
02:11:37,191 --> 02:11:38,240
Well I had a guy do it.

4990
02:11:38,241 --> 02:11:39,200
I didn't do it myself.

4991
02:11:39,201 --> 02:11:39,651
I'm busy,

4992
02:11:39,651 --> 02:11:40,310
dude.

4993
02:11:40,310 --> 02:11:41,143
I got shit to do.

4994
02:11:41,570 --> 02:11:42,110
But yeah,

4995
02:11:42,110 --> 02:11:43,670
it's called a European mounts,

4996
02:11:43,850 --> 02:11:46,640
like easing the structure
of the inside of his,

4997
02:11:46,730 --> 02:11:47,750
his nose.

4998
02:11:48,710 --> 02:11:49,041
Oh yeah.

4999
02:11:49,041 --> 02:11:49,161
They're,

5000
02:11:49,161 --> 02:11:49,400
no,

5001
02:11:49,400 --> 02:11:50,600
they're not there.

5002
02:11:50,990 --> 02:11:52,270
Their nostrils are incredible.

5003
02:11:52,271 --> 02:11:53,100
It's amazing.

5004
02:11:53,100 --> 02:11:54,830
That's a deer is a little different.

5005
02:11:55,130 --> 02:11:55,970
They're both dear.

5006
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,400
That's the largest deer in North America.

5007
02:11:58,430 --> 02:11:59,350
So how much your speeches,

5008
02:11:59,360 --> 02:11:59,990
your moose,

5009
02:11:59,990 --> 02:12:01,480
that's a moose cause it
doesn't look like a Mousse.

5010
02:12:01,580 --> 02:12:02,600
It's a small moves.

5011
02:12:02,601 --> 02:12:05,180
That's why he was only
a couple of years old.

5012
02:12:05,181 --> 02:12:06,920
So he was only 900 pounds.

5013
02:12:07,010 --> 02:12:07,580
Wow.

5014
02:12:07,580 --> 02:12:09,620
But I'm a big moose.

5015
02:12:09,850 --> 02:12:10,910
Pounds is huge.

5016
02:12:11,150 --> 02:12:11,721
It is.

5017
02:12:11,721 --> 02:12:16,460
But not for a moose to get my friend
shot one that was 1400 pounds.

5018
02:12:16,480 --> 02:12:17,090
Wow.

5019
02:12:17,090 --> 02:12:19,190
But my point being that the muscle,

5020
02:12:19,220 --> 02:12:22,340
like the tissue is really dense.

5021
02:12:22,670 --> 02:12:25,370
Like there's some areas like the back,

5022
02:12:25,700 --> 02:12:28,550
like the tenderloins and the
backstraps that are more,

5023
02:12:28,580 --> 02:12:29,720
more of a tender meat.

5024
02:12:29,760 --> 02:12:30,320
Right.

5025
02:12:30,320 --> 02:12:30,590
Right.

5026
02:12:30,590 --> 02:12:31,131
But the,

5027
02:12:31,131 --> 02:12:31,341
uh,

5028
02:12:31,341 --> 02:12:34,390
the tissue of a Moose is so right.

5029
02:12:35,900 --> 02:12:39,440
It's a fucking unbelievably
powerful animal that,

5030
02:12:39,830 --> 02:12:40,431
I mean they,

5031
02:12:40,431 --> 02:12:41,120
when that his,

5032
02:12:41,120 --> 02:12:45,650
if he got older he would have these huge
fucking saloon doors grown out of his

5033
02:12:45,651 --> 02:12:49,640
head and then he would use
those to slamming the other
dudes who also have those

5034
02:12:49,641 --> 02:12:52,580
things and they're just so strong.

5035
02:12:52,790 --> 02:12:54,950
So the meat is like really tough.

5036
02:12:54,980 --> 02:12:55,161
Yeah.

5037
02:12:55,161 --> 02:12:58,210
They haven't been bred for
eons to be a hamburger.

5038
02:12:58,310 --> 02:12:59,143
Exactly.

5039
02:12:59,150 --> 02:13:04,150
And my friend shot a water buffalo in
Australia and he said they cooked the back

5040
02:13:04,621 --> 02:13:05,061
strap,

5041
02:13:05,061 --> 02:13:06,800
which is like the most tender part.

5042
02:13:06,801 --> 02:13:09,710
And he said he had a piece of meat in his
mouth that he chewed for half an hour.

5043
02:13:10,280 --> 02:13:11,310
He's not joking,

5044
02:13:11,510 --> 02:13:15,320
said he's practicing his bone out and he
was practicing for a half an hour with

5045
02:13:15,321 --> 02:13:18,320
one piece of meat in his mouth
and he was trying to break down.

5046
02:13:20,620 --> 02:13:21,050
I mean,

5047
02:13:21,050 --> 02:13:21,860
we're so,

5048
02:13:21,860 --> 02:13:24,830
we're such pussies were so soft and mushy.

5049
02:13:24,870 --> 02:13:25,340
Like we're,

5050
02:13:25,340 --> 02:13:25,820
you know,

5051
02:13:25,820 --> 02:13:29,310
we're talking about like cage fighting
and like amazing and get in there and you

5052
02:13:29,311 --> 02:13:30,320
fighting against a person.

5053
02:13:30,380 --> 02:13:30,501
Oh,

5054
02:13:30,501 --> 02:13:30,711
I know.

5055
02:13:30,711 --> 02:13:32,160
I felt about it a lot of times

5056
02:13:32,160 --> 02:13:35,490
about how scared I was when I would
think about like how much harder,

5057
02:13:35,700 --> 02:13:36,930
you know other people have it.

5058
02:13:37,140 --> 02:13:37,291
You know,

5059
02:13:37,291 --> 02:13:38,010
I was reading other,

5060
02:13:38,010 --> 02:13:40,590
other memoirs of people like
who did dangerous things,

5061
02:13:40,591 --> 02:13:44,100
especially like war reporters
like Sebastian younger
went over and wrote books

5062
02:13:44,101 --> 02:13:45,600
about the Afghanistan war.

5063
02:13:45,601 --> 02:13:48,510
We went into this little platoon
way off in the middle of nowhere.

5064
02:13:48,511 --> 02:13:49,560
I mean they're really in the,

5065
02:13:49,610 --> 02:13:50,443
in the shit.

5066
02:13:51,240 --> 02:13:53,760
He got blown up in a home
v you know all kinds of,

5067
02:13:54,390 --> 02:13:54,950
you know,

5068
02:13:54,950 --> 02:13:59,370
bad ass stuff and he didn't complain
and bitch and Moan about it.

5069
02:13:59,770 --> 02:14:00,361
You went back.

5070
02:14:00,361 --> 02:14:01,530
I know that guy is nuts.

5071
02:14:01,531 --> 02:14:02,580
The bravery or those guys,

5072
02:14:02,581 --> 02:14:03,414
this is astonishing.

5073
02:14:03,450 --> 02:14:07,050
And so you compare to the cage has these
guys seem really brave and they are but

5074
02:14:07,320 --> 02:14:07,790
that's,

5075
02:14:07,790 --> 02:14:08,880
that's a whole nother level.

5076
02:14:08,910 --> 02:14:12,090
Well and Sebastian younger is
not even shooting back now.

5077
02:14:12,180 --> 02:14:12,930
He's writing.

5078
02:14:12,930 --> 02:14:16,900
Yeah and he's got his head up cause
he's got his camera cause he's,

5079
02:14:16,910 --> 02:14:18,210
he's videotaping all of this stuff.

5080
02:14:18,211 --> 02:14:20,460
You did two documentaries and you know,

5081
02:14:20,461 --> 02:14:21,830
bullets are flying and he's got his,

5082
02:14:21,900 --> 02:14:23,190
he's got his head up.

5083
02:14:23,400 --> 02:14:25,620
What kind of fucking
Ptsd does that guy have?

5084
02:14:25,770 --> 02:14:26,190
His friend,

5085
02:14:26,190 --> 02:14:27,060
his friend died,

5086
02:14:27,090 --> 02:14:27,570
you know,

5087
02:14:27,570 --> 02:14:29,080
like a week after,

5088
02:14:29,081 --> 02:14:29,690
or not recapture,

5089
02:14:29,690 --> 02:14:30,870
but as soon afterwards,

5090
02:14:30,871 --> 02:14:31,141
his,

5091
02:14:31,141 --> 02:14:34,620
his friend and the other camera man
got on Tim Hetherington was killed,

5092
02:14:34,621 --> 02:14:35,700
I believe in Libya.

5093
02:14:36,080 --> 02:14:36,491
Um,

5094
02:14:36,491 --> 02:14:37,171
and so yeah,

5095
02:14:37,171 --> 02:14:41,280
I think he's got some pretty
severe emotional insight,

5096
02:14:41,430 --> 02:14:42,510
psychological damage from it.

5097
02:14:42,511 --> 02:14:42,870
He,

5098
02:14:42,870 --> 02:14:44,010
he said he was not going back.

5099
02:14:44,040 --> 02:14:45,780
He said he's not going
back to war zones anymore.

5100
02:14:46,170 --> 02:14:47,003
Yeah.

5101
02:14:47,160 --> 02:14:48,390
I would say that's a good decision.

5102
02:14:48,420 --> 02:14:49,000
Yeah.

5103
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:49,560
Yeah.

5104
02:14:49,560 --> 02:14:50,250
He knows when to quit.

5105
02:14:50,250 --> 02:14:50,670
Yeah.

5106
02:14:50,670 --> 02:14:52,590
But if it wasn't for guys like that,

5107
02:14:52,591 --> 02:14:54,630
are the people that film like Restrepo or,

5108
02:14:54,810 --> 02:14:55,230
Yeah.

5109
02:14:55,230 --> 02:14:55,981
That's who it is.

5110
02:14:55,981 --> 02:14:56,221
Yeah.

5111
02:14:56,221 --> 02:14:57,054
That's who it is.

5112
02:14:57,410 --> 02:14:59,050
That was Hetherington and special,

5113
02:14:59,080 --> 02:14:59,850
younger.

5114
02:14:59,850 --> 02:15:00,480
And um,

5115
02:15:00,480 --> 02:15:04,500
there's a new documentary
that a younger as a fighter,

5116
02:15:04,501 --> 02:15:04,711
you know,

5117
02:15:04,711 --> 02:15:05,220
by the way,

5118
02:15:05,220 --> 02:15:05,610
was he?

5119
02:15:05,610 --> 02:15:05,941
Yeah.

5120
02:15:05,941 --> 02:15:06,631
Sebastian younger.

5121
02:15:06,631 --> 02:15:07,500
Read my book please.

5122
02:15:07,550 --> 02:15:07,650
Oh,

5123
02:15:07,650 --> 02:15:09,040
it looks like it is Moses kind of,

5124
02:15:09,130 --> 02:15:09,370
yeah,

5125
02:15:09,370 --> 02:15:10,920
he's a he he boxes,

5126
02:15:11,020 --> 02:15:11,400
uh,

5127
02:15:11,400 --> 02:15:12,720
still I believe so.

5128
02:15:12,721 --> 02:15:13,330
Yeah,

5129
02:15:13,330 --> 02:15:13,541
I do.

5130
02:15:13,541 --> 02:15:14,820
So he's a tough guy.

5131
02:15:14,880 --> 02:15:16,980
That's one of the things that I
really wanted to talk to you about.

5132
02:15:17,040 --> 02:15:17,760
Um,

5133
02:15:17,760 --> 02:15:18,180
when,

5134
02:15:18,180 --> 02:15:18,541
uh,

5135
02:15:18,541 --> 02:15:20,580
I had heard this concept
of professor in the cage,

5136
02:15:20,610 --> 02:15:24,000
the protecting of essential
cognitive function,

5137
02:15:24,001 --> 02:15:26,790
which is necessary to pursue your career.

5138
02:15:26,820 --> 02:15:27,210
Yeah.

5139
02:15:27,210 --> 02:15:28,043
I mean,

5140
02:15:28,290 --> 02:15:32,820
did you find there was any
negative repercussions physically?

5141
02:15:32,850 --> 02:15:34,290
Did you feel anything time?

5142
02:15:34,490 --> 02:15:34,770
Uh,

5143
02:15:34,770 --> 02:15:37,170
the first time I got punched
really hard in the face,

5144
02:15:37,570 --> 02:15:37,880
um,

5145
02:15:37,880 --> 02:15:39,030
was really educate.

5146
02:15:39,031 --> 02:15:39,930
It's really educational,

5147
02:15:40,160 --> 02:15:40,380
you know,

5148
02:15:40,380 --> 02:15:41,970
because watching from outside the cage,

5149
02:15:42,150 --> 02:15:43,110
you kinda know like,

5150
02:15:43,140 --> 02:15:43,321
you know,

5151
02:15:43,321 --> 02:15:44,700
this isn't good for these people.

5152
02:15:44,910 --> 02:15:47,100
You kind of know what
to brain damage contest,

5153
02:15:47,490 --> 02:15:49,680
but it's different actually feel it.

5154
02:15:49,740 --> 02:15:50,191
And,

5155
02:15:50,191 --> 02:15:50,520
uh,

5156
02:15:50,520 --> 02:15:52,050
the first time I got
knocked around pretty good,

5157
02:15:52,390 --> 02:15:52,730
um,

5158
02:15:52,730 --> 02:15:53,091
and,

5159
02:15:53,091 --> 02:15:53,490
and,

5160
02:15:53,490 --> 02:15:56,130
and afterwards kind of felt
concussed even during the,

5161
02:15:56,190 --> 02:15:57,020
the attack,

5162
02:15:57,020 --> 02:15:58,140
even when I was getting,

5163
02:15:58,141 --> 02:15:59,160
taking these shots,

5164
02:15:59,730 --> 02:16:00,360
um,

5165
02:16:00,360 --> 02:16:01,410
I was able to think to myself,

5166
02:16:01,411 --> 02:16:01,890
you know,

5167
02:16:01,890 --> 02:16:02,281
uh,

5168
02:16:02,281 --> 02:16:02,701
I try,

5169
02:16:02,701 --> 02:16:07,170
I make my living trying to think smart
thoughts and I better quit while I still

5170
02:16:07,171 --> 02:16:08,040
know my alphabet.

5171
02:16:08,610 --> 02:16:09,150
Um,

5172
02:16:09,150 --> 02:16:09,780
but I didn't.

5173
02:16:09,780 --> 02:16:10,380
Um,

5174
02:16:10,380 --> 02:16:11,040
but what was the,

5175
02:16:11,040 --> 02:16:12,780
was the negative aspects of it?

5176
02:16:13,140 --> 02:16:13,681
I don't know.

5177
02:16:13,681 --> 02:16:14,130
I mean,

5178
02:16:14,130 --> 02:16:16,600
I don't think I had a
lot of headaches and,

5179
02:16:16,620 --> 02:16:16,831
uh,

5180
02:16:16,831 --> 02:16:17,581
occasionally I would,

5181
02:16:17,581 --> 02:16:18,091
I would be,

5182
02:16:18,091 --> 02:16:18,924
I'd be cloudy,

5183
02:16:19,050 --> 02:16:19,381
you know,

5184
02:16:19,381 --> 02:16:21,060
for a day or two afterwards,

5185
02:16:21,090 --> 02:16:21,331
you know,

5186
02:16:21,331 --> 02:16:22,380
there's this sort of just barn.

5187
02:16:22,410 --> 02:16:22,651
Yeah,

5188
02:16:22,651 --> 02:16:23,460
I'd be like a little,

5189
02:16:23,460 --> 02:16:24,180
I felt like it was like,

5190
02:16:24,180 --> 02:16:24,420
you know,

5191
02:16:24,420 --> 02:16:24,700
describe it.

5192
02:16:24,700 --> 02:16:28,500
It's sort of like a translucent blanket
thrown over my head and slowed my

5193
02:16:28,501 --> 02:16:30,730
thinking and clouded my perception.

5194
02:16:30,760 --> 02:16:34,480
Did you ever get that same sort of feeling
just from hard training where you're

5195
02:16:34,510 --> 02:16:36,670
exhausted and all this is
definitely a time where,

5196
02:16:36,690 --> 02:16:36,970
uh,

5197
02:16:36,970 --> 02:16:37,803
a couple of times I got,

5198
02:16:37,810 --> 02:16:38,021
you know,

5199
02:16:38,021 --> 02:16:38,400
again,

5200
02:16:38,400 --> 02:16:41,440
one of the situations you're
inspiring and guys hit you too hard.

5201
02:16:42,220 --> 02:16:45,190
And there was a couple of guys who are
notorious for it and I got really jacked

5202
02:16:45,191 --> 02:16:45,360
up.

5203
02:16:45,360 --> 02:16:47,080
I buy it by a few guys,

5204
02:16:47,530 --> 02:16:47,950
um,

5205
02:16:47,950 --> 02:16:48,701
one time where,

5206
02:16:48,701 --> 02:16:48,851
you know,

5207
02:16:48,851 --> 02:16:51,250
it's kind of just landed this
brutal left hook against me.

5208
02:16:51,510 --> 02:16:51,720
Um,

5209
02:16:51,720 --> 02:16:52,930
and he didn't really mean to like,

5210
02:16:52,931 --> 02:16:53,980
he apologized afterwards.

5211
02:16:53,981 --> 02:16:54,701
I was moving in,

5212
02:16:54,701 --> 02:16:54,881
you know,

5213
02:16:54,881 --> 02:16:55,900
he tagged me hard.

5214
02:16:56,240 --> 02:16:56,740
Um,

5215
02:16:56,740 --> 02:16:57,190
and,

5216
02:16:57,190 --> 02:16:57,641
you know,

5217
02:16:57,641 --> 02:16:59,140
I was almost knocked out,

5218
02:16:59,320 --> 02:17:00,153
uh,

5219
02:17:00,390 --> 02:17:01,030
you know,

5220
02:17:01,030 --> 02:17:02,050
saw stars,

5221
02:17:02,080 --> 02:17:02,611
uh,

5222
02:17:02,611 --> 02:17:03,580
the whole world,

5223
02:17:03,581 --> 02:17:05,950
my perception of the world
for artist torques flipping,

5224
02:17:05,980 --> 02:17:06,813
flipping over,

5225
02:17:06,820 --> 02:17:09,010
the lights are kind of
going on and off and,

5226
02:17:09,490 --> 02:17:09,910
um,

5227
02:17:09,910 --> 02:17:10,360
but I didn't,

5228
02:17:10,360 --> 02:17:10,540
I,

5229
02:17:10,540 --> 02:17:11,140
you know,

5230
02:17:11,140 --> 02:17:11,771
with brain damage,

5231
02:17:11,771 --> 02:17:15,010
it's usually a time bomb that
goes off sometime in the future.

5232
02:17:15,010 --> 02:17:15,470
So you don't,

5233
02:17:15,470 --> 02:17:15,890
you know,

5234
02:17:15,890 --> 02:17:16,960
is there isn't,

5235
02:17:16,961 --> 02:17:17,510
there isn't.

5236
02:17:17,510 --> 02:17:18,400
There's also,

5237
02:17:18,401 --> 02:17:18,910
um,

5238
02:17:18,910 --> 02:17:21,250
there's an accumulative damage issue,

5239
02:17:21,251 --> 02:17:22,540
but there's also a,

5240
02:17:22,541 --> 02:17:26,690
I've met guys where I knew them and then
they had one really hard fight and then

5241
02:17:26,700 --> 02:17:27,533
they were different.

5242
02:17:27,730 --> 02:17:27,911
Yeah.

5243
02:17:27,911 --> 02:17:28,271
So I didn't,

5244
02:17:28,271 --> 02:17:29,110
I didn't have anything like that,

5245
02:17:29,111 --> 02:17:30,190
at least not to my knowledge.

5246
02:17:30,220 --> 02:17:30,461
I mean,

5247
02:17:30,461 --> 02:17:30,850
I'd have,

5248
02:17:30,850 --> 02:17:33,280
I'd have short term repercussions of it,

5249
02:17:33,340 --> 02:17:36,360
but how often will you sparring are,

5250
02:17:36,910 --> 02:17:39,940
Kim was not all that
enlightened of a place,

5251
02:17:39,970 --> 02:17:40,271
you know,

5252
02:17:40,271 --> 02:17:42,760
and the culture of it was pretty intense.

5253
02:17:43,060 --> 02:17:44,030
So I dunno,

5254
02:17:44,080 --> 02:17:46,450
probably probably twice a week.

5255
02:17:46,451 --> 02:17:47,440
Pretty hard sparring,

5256
02:17:47,710 --> 02:17:48,370
you know.

5257
02:17:48,370 --> 02:17:49,203
Um,

5258
02:17:49,240 --> 02:17:54,240
I'm always fascinated by people who know
the repercussions and still dive into

5259
02:17:54,281 --> 02:17:55,810
it and still just say,

5260
02:17:55,811 --> 02:17:56,291
you know what,

5261
02:17:56,291 --> 02:17:56,891
it's a,

5262
02:17:56,891 --> 02:17:59,350
it's worth the risk to what
everybody is doing nowadays.

5263
02:17:59,351 --> 02:18:00,550
Everybody knows the risks.

5264
02:18:00,660 --> 02:18:00,900
I don't,

5265
02:18:00,900 --> 02:18:01,081
I don't,

5266
02:18:01,081 --> 02:18:01,630
I mean,

5267
02:18:01,630 --> 02:18:02,620
and then may fighters,

5268
02:18:02,650 --> 02:18:03,230
you know,

5269
02:18:03,230 --> 02:18:04,630
he's kind of either smart guys,

5270
02:18:04,720 --> 02:18:05,710
these are middleclass guys,

5271
02:18:05,711 --> 02:18:07,150
most of them college educated,

5272
02:18:07,180 --> 02:18:10,030
but a guy like you is different
because you're not really,

5273
02:18:10,031 --> 02:18:12,370
I mean you are an MMA fighter
and that you did fight,

5274
02:18:12,820 --> 02:18:15,160
but that's not like what you're pursuing.

5275
02:18:15,710 --> 02:18:16,780
It is my pursuit though.

5276
02:18:16,810 --> 02:18:17,320
My procedures,

5277
02:18:17,320 --> 02:18:19,610
writing books and I saw a good book in it,

5278
02:18:19,660 --> 02:18:21,460
so I did it for professional reasons too.

5279
02:18:21,550 --> 02:18:21,920
I mean there was,

5280
02:18:21,920 --> 02:18:24,460
there was a personal reason I'd
never been in a fight before.

5281
02:18:24,461 --> 02:18:26,320
I was kind of curious about
whether I was a coward or not.

5282
02:18:26,740 --> 02:18:27,191
Um,

5283
02:18:27,191 --> 02:18:30,040
and I wanted to do this brave
thing for me was a very,

5284
02:18:30,130 --> 02:18:30,970
it was a brave thing.

5285
02:18:31,420 --> 02:18:31,990
Um,

5286
02:18:31,990 --> 02:18:34,720
but there was also a professional thing
just like the fighters have and the

5287
02:18:34,721 --> 02:18:36,310
fighters are doing it because
they need to make a living.

5288
02:18:36,600 --> 02:18:37,060
Um,

5289
02:18:37,060 --> 02:18:39,310
I was doing it because I
wasn't making much of a living.

5290
02:18:39,450 --> 02:18:39,880
Um,

5291
02:18:39,880 --> 02:18:43,900
and I needed to try to do
something something up that would,

5292
02:18:43,901 --> 02:18:44,111
yeah,

5293
02:18:44,111 --> 02:18:46,480
that would shock shock a little bit,

5294
02:18:46,640 --> 02:18:48,670
shocked me out of my old ruts.

5295
02:18:48,800 --> 02:18:49,420
Um,

5296
02:18:49,420 --> 02:18:53,200
and write a book that had larger audience
than the books I'd written before,

5297
02:18:53,201 --> 02:18:55,660
which was sort of books
for English lit nerds.

5298
02:18:55,930 --> 02:18:59,470
Now what was the actual
experience of the fight?

5299
02:18:59,471 --> 02:19:01,900
Like talk us through the day of it.

5300
02:19:01,901 --> 02:19:03,820
What did you feel like when
you woke up in the morning?

5301
02:19:03,830 --> 02:19:04,121
You knew,

5302
02:19:04,121 --> 02:19:04,871
Holy Shit,

5303
02:19:04,871 --> 02:19:05,704
today's the day.

5304
02:19:07,170 --> 02:19:08,003
Uh,

5305
02:19:08,440 --> 02:19:08,891
I was,

5306
02:19:08,891 --> 02:19:09,724
you know,

5307
02:19:10,330 --> 02:19:11,710
there was a level of anxiety,

5308
02:19:11,800 --> 02:19:12,633
uh,

5309
02:19:12,700 --> 02:19:13,660
that was always there.

5310
02:19:13,840 --> 02:19:14,673
Um,

5311
02:19:14,710 --> 02:19:15,491
I was glad,

5312
02:19:15,491 --> 02:19:16,001
however,

5313
02:19:16,001 --> 02:19:19,540
but I didn't feel the terror
that I felt that I might fear.

5314
02:19:19,870 --> 02:19:22,940
I was afraid that I'd be so scared that
I'd like kicking out or just or just

5315
02:19:23,020 --> 02:19:23,853
behave in a,

5316
02:19:24,170 --> 02:19:24,880
in a coward,

5317
02:19:24,880 --> 02:19:25,713
the fashion.

5318
02:19:26,020 --> 02:19:26,853
Um,

5319
02:19:27,590 --> 02:19:30,290
and there was a lot of anxiety but
it wasn't as bad as I expected.

5320
02:19:30,350 --> 02:19:31,580
And when I got in the cage,

5321
02:19:31,850 --> 02:19:33,290
one thing that was
really interesting to me,

5322
02:19:33,291 --> 02:19:34,400
cause I didn't know this would happen,

5323
02:19:34,401 --> 02:19:36,890
is all of the feared
pretty much evaporated.

5324
02:19:37,310 --> 02:19:38,240
A fear is really,

5325
02:19:38,241 --> 02:19:39,074
really useful.

5326
02:19:39,230 --> 02:19:39,501
You know,

5327
02:19:39,501 --> 02:19:40,910
it's your body's way of saying to you,

5328
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:41,331
dude,

5329
02:19:41,331 --> 02:19:42,530
this is really dumb,

5330
02:19:43,340 --> 02:19:44,173
really dumb.

5331
02:19:44,330 --> 02:19:45,320
Let's reconsider,

5332
02:19:45,610 --> 02:19:45,800
right?

5333
02:19:45,800 --> 02:19:47,750
See if there's a different
way to do this thing.

5334
02:19:48,140 --> 02:19:49,160
So it's useful going in.

5335
02:19:49,161 --> 02:19:51,410
But once you're in the cage
and you've been locked inside,

5336
02:19:51,860 --> 02:19:53,420
fear is no longer very useful.

5337
02:19:53,450 --> 02:19:54,260
Um,

5338
02:19:54,260 --> 02:19:55,970
cowering is not going to save you.

5339
02:19:56,030 --> 02:19:56,331
You know,

5340
02:19:56,331 --> 02:19:56,931
you're locked in.

5341
02:19:56,931 --> 02:19:58,160
There's no getting out of this thing.

5342
02:19:58,490 --> 02:20:01,370
And my fear just kind of went away and
it was replaced by something that was

5343
02:20:01,371 --> 02:20:02,630
really cool.

5344
02:20:02,631 --> 02:20:03,470
In retrospect,

5345
02:20:03,471 --> 02:20:06,530
it was this a sense of focus
that I'd never felt before.

5346
02:20:06,920 --> 02:20:07,611
Never felt before,

5347
02:20:07,611 --> 02:20:08,510
nothing close to it.

5348
02:20:08,540 --> 02:20:10,730
Like I was in this arena and
minor league hockey and Rena,

5349
02:20:10,731 --> 02:20:12,590
there's people there hooting and howling.

5350
02:20:13,130 --> 02:20:13,963
Um,

5351
02:20:14,480 --> 02:20:15,320
I saw nothing.

5352
02:20:15,830 --> 02:20:17,300
I heard nothing.

5353
02:20:17,630 --> 02:20:19,250
All I could see was
the guy in front of me.

5354
02:20:19,310 --> 02:20:21,170
All I could hear was him.

5355
02:20:21,200 --> 02:20:21,441
You know,

5356
02:20:21,441 --> 02:20:22,850
I've had this incredible tunnel vision.

5357
02:20:22,851 --> 02:20:25,760
So at some point my coach
was screaming at me,

5358
02:20:25,790 --> 02:20:26,430
you know,

5359
02:20:26,430 --> 02:20:26,571
uh,

5360
02:20:26,571 --> 02:20:27,560
screaming out instructions,

5361
02:20:27,580 --> 02:20:28,730
screaming out warnings,

5362
02:20:28,940 --> 02:20:33,050
and he's a loud guy and he's one of
these classic corner men whose voice just

5363
02:20:33,051 --> 02:20:34,030
fills the whole,

5364
02:20:34,070 --> 02:20:34,390
uh,

5365
02:20:34,390 --> 02:20:35,070
arena.

5366
02:20:35,070 --> 02:20:35,903
I had never heard it.

5367
02:20:36,680 --> 02:20:39,800
I never heard as there was
nothing in the world except for,

5368
02:20:39,801 --> 02:20:40,670
except for that guy.

5369
02:20:41,210 --> 02:20:42,043
Um,

5370
02:20:42,230 --> 02:20:42,711
so yeah,

5371
02:20:42,711 --> 02:20:43,070
that was,

5372
02:20:43,070 --> 02:20:43,940
how did the fight go?

5373
02:20:44,360 --> 02:20:45,193
Um,

5374
02:20:45,380 --> 02:20:46,160
you know,

5375
02:20:46,160 --> 02:20:47,810
I don't want to get
too much away about it,

5376
02:20:47,811 --> 02:20:49,400
but why is it in the book?

5377
02:20:49,430 --> 02:20:51,320
It's in the book and I sort
of build some suspense to it,

5378
02:20:51,350 --> 02:20:51,801
but you know,

5379
02:20:51,801 --> 02:20:52,880
you don't want to tell us what happened.

5380
02:20:52,940 --> 02:20:54,350
I'll tell you a little
bit about what happened.

5381
02:20:54,420 --> 02:20:55,253
Uh,

5382
02:20:55,960 --> 02:20:57,350
the fight was 47 seconds long.

5383
02:20:57,650 --> 02:20:58,483
Did you win?

5384
02:20:58,490 --> 02:21:03,490
I won the first 46 seconds and
in the fight took a nasty turn,

5385
02:21:03,760 --> 02:21:04,040
uh,

5386
02:21:04,040 --> 02:21:06,320
in the last second one second.

5387
02:21:07,040 --> 02:21:07,641
Pretty much.

5388
02:21:07,641 --> 02:21:08,090
Yeah.

5389
02:21:08,090 --> 02:21:09,020
It was pretty abrupt.

5390
02:21:09,021 --> 02:21:09,854
Uh,

5391
02:21:10,040 --> 02:21:10,251
I,

5392
02:21:10,251 --> 02:21:10,461
yeah,

5393
02:21:10,461 --> 02:21:11,660
for 46 seconds I was,

5394
02:21:11,661 --> 02:21:14,450
I was sort of imposing my will and things
were going my way and I was starting

5395
02:21:14,451 --> 02:21:15,284
to feel good.

5396
02:21:15,560 --> 02:21:15,861
Uh,

5397
02:21:15,861 --> 02:21:16,460
and then,

5398
02:21:16,460 --> 02:21:17,120
uh,

5399
02:21:17,120 --> 02:21:17,930
you know,

5400
02:21:17,930 --> 02:21:18,763
things went bad.

5401
02:21:19,010 --> 02:21:19,550
Yeah,

5402
02:21:19,550 --> 02:21:21,620
things went really bad and it was over.

5403
02:21:21,800 --> 02:21:22,371
It was that fast.

5404
02:21:22,371 --> 02:21:22,940
It was amazing.

5405
02:21:22,940 --> 02:21:25,790
Did you want to do it
again after it was over?

5406
02:21:25,880 --> 02:21:26,690
Desperately.

5407
02:21:26,690 --> 02:21:29,270
Really desperately and it
will seem to sweaty yet.

5408
02:21:30,050 --> 02:21:30,950
I wasn't even sweaty yet.

5409
02:21:31,010 --> 02:21:31,491
And I was like,

5410
02:21:31,491 --> 02:21:31,851
okay,

5411
02:21:31,851 --> 02:21:33,020
now I know how to do this.

5412
02:21:33,050 --> 02:21:34,400
Did you get hit or did you get choked?

5413
02:21:34,970 --> 02:21:35,810
I got her on bird.

5414
02:21:36,590 --> 02:21:37,820
That's not a bad way to lose.

5415
02:21:37,821 --> 02:21:38,360
No,

5416
02:21:38,360 --> 02:21:38,841
it wasn't,

5417
02:21:38,841 --> 02:21:40,970
but it wasn't part of it.

5418
02:21:40,971 --> 02:21:41,121
You know,

5419
02:21:41,121 --> 02:21:45,590
I'm approaching it as a writer and I
wanted to like a story that was more epic,

5420
02:21:45,710 --> 02:21:46,031
you know,

5421
02:21:46,031 --> 02:21:46,864
a more of a,

5422
02:21:47,150 --> 02:21:47,631
I don't know what,

5423
02:21:47,631 --> 02:21:49,160
it's more of a heroic struggle.

5424
02:21:49,520 --> 02:21:51,140
Something make a better story.

5425
02:21:51,530 --> 02:21:52,130
Um,

5426
02:21:52,130 --> 02:21:52,911
and part of it was,

5427
02:21:52,911 --> 02:21:53,091
you know,

5428
02:21:53,091 --> 02:21:54,230
I really screwed up.

5429
02:21:54,560 --> 02:21:57,830
I really screwed up in the
fight and afterwards I was like,

5430
02:21:57,831 --> 02:21:58,431
okay,

5431
02:21:58,431 --> 02:22:00,410
now I have this under my belt.

5432
02:22:00,410 --> 02:22:03,560
And I was almost positive that I
wouldn't have made that mistake again.

5433
02:22:03,830 --> 02:22:05,000
I would know how to do it.

5434
02:22:05,030 --> 02:22:05,690
I would,

5435
02:22:05,690 --> 02:22:07,520
I kinda need it really bad rookie mistake.

5436
02:22:07,610 --> 02:22:08,271
What was the mistake?

5437
02:22:08,271 --> 02:22:09,104
Well,

5438
02:22:09,830 --> 02:22:13,030
basically my strategy going in was I,

5439
02:22:13,031 --> 02:22:13,940
I was not,

5440
02:22:14,120 --> 02:22:16,640
I was always a better grappler
than I was to striker.

5441
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:18,350
It wasn't that I was a great grappler,

5442
02:22:18,920 --> 02:22:20,510
but I was better at it than striking.

5443
02:22:20,780 --> 02:22:22,790
And so we didn't know
anything about the guy.

5444
02:22:22,791 --> 02:22:23,390
Other guy.

5445
02:22:23,390 --> 02:22:24,223
We knew nothing.

5446
02:22:24,350 --> 02:22:25,183
He had no Google.

5447
02:22:26,040 --> 02:22:26,873
Um,

5448
02:22:27,150 --> 02:22:28,380
we didn't know if he was a striker,

5449
02:22:28,381 --> 02:22:29,071
a grappler.

5450
02:22:29,071 --> 02:22:30,570
We didn't know if he's left
handed or right handed.

5451
02:22:30,571 --> 02:22:32,220
These are all really
bad things not to know.

5452
02:22:32,730 --> 02:22:33,810
And so the game plan was us,

5453
02:22:33,860 --> 02:22:36,540
we take them down and try to
make them fight me off his back.

5454
02:22:36,541 --> 02:22:37,770
Cause that's what I did best.

5455
02:22:38,220 --> 02:22:39,053
Um,

5456
02:22:39,150 --> 02:22:39,901
so you know,

5457
02:22:39,901 --> 02:22:40,260
right off,

5458
02:22:40,260 --> 02:22:40,891
right off the bat,

5459
02:22:40,891 --> 02:22:41,724
you know,

5460
02:22:42,270 --> 02:22:42,631
within,

5461
02:22:42,631 --> 02:22:42,781
you know,

5462
02:22:42,781 --> 02:22:43,830
a few seconds I shot,

5463
02:22:43,831 --> 02:22:44,664
got a takedown.

5464
02:22:45,020 --> 02:22:45,590
Um,

5465
02:22:45,590 --> 02:22:45,781
God,

5466
02:22:45,781 --> 02:22:49,790
I'm down against the fence was about
this close to securing the mount.

5467
02:22:49,830 --> 02:22:50,150
You know,

5468
02:22:50,150 --> 02:22:50,810
I,

5469
02:22:50,810 --> 02:22:51,300
I,

5470
02:22:51,300 --> 02:22:52,290
he kind of had me in a headlock.

5471
02:22:52,291 --> 02:22:52,891
I got out of it,

5472
02:22:52,891 --> 02:22:55,620
so my foot up and it was
almost in the mountain then,

5473
02:22:55,621 --> 02:22:55,950
you know,

5474
02:22:55,950 --> 02:22:58,260
that then was the first clue
that I was out of my league.

5475
02:22:58,261 --> 02:22:58,411
You know,

5476
02:22:58,411 --> 02:23:00,570
right away he just did
this really kind of fancy,

5477
02:23:00,571 --> 02:23:02,130
sophisticated thing,

5478
02:23:02,131 --> 02:23:05,070
redrew me effortlessly into the garden
and started working on that arm bar.

5479
02:23:05,670 --> 02:23:07,110
And uh,

5480
02:23:07,980 --> 02:23:08,430
I didn't,

5481
02:23:08,430 --> 02:23:09,450
and I knew something was bad,

5482
02:23:09,500 --> 02:23:10,620
something bad was happening.

5483
02:23:10,770 --> 02:23:11,603
And so I guess,

5484
02:23:11,940 --> 02:23:13,470
so I got up and I can't,

5485
02:23:13,471 --> 02:23:13,981
in Yankton,

5486
02:23:13,981 --> 02:23:14,371
Yankton,

5487
02:23:14,371 --> 02:23:15,840
Yankton got out and ran for it.

5488
02:23:16,290 --> 02:23:16,920
Okay.

5489
02:23:16,920 --> 02:23:18,510
He rose to his feet and chases me.

5490
02:23:19,050 --> 02:23:20,790
And at that point,

5491
02:23:20,850 --> 02:23:21,481
that was when,

5492
02:23:21,481 --> 02:23:22,020
uh,

5493
02:23:22,020 --> 02:23:23,550
unexperienced fighter would have said,

5494
02:23:23,551 --> 02:23:24,384
okay,

5495
02:23:24,900 --> 02:23:27,720
it's not a good idea to roll around
on it with this guy on the ground.

5496
02:23:27,720 --> 02:23:28,890
We need to change the plan.

5497
02:23:29,130 --> 02:23:30,600
And that's what my coach
is screaming at me.

5498
02:23:31,290 --> 02:23:31,561
You know,

5499
02:23:31,561 --> 02:23:31,711
he's,

5500
02:23:31,711 --> 02:23:32,521
he was screaming at me,

5501
02:23:32,521 --> 02:23:33,250
you know,

5502
02:23:33,250 --> 02:23:34,860
you don't want to go to
the ground with this guy.

5503
02:23:35,370 --> 02:23:36,203
Um,

5504
02:23:36,420 --> 02:23:37,410
and immediately,

5505
02:23:37,470 --> 02:23:37,861
you know,

5506
02:23:37,861 --> 02:23:38,190
I was,

5507
02:23:38,190 --> 02:23:38,461
I couldn't,

5508
02:23:38,461 --> 02:23:39,460
I couldn't break out of the game plan.

5509
02:23:39,461 --> 02:23:40,500
It never even occurred to me.

5510
02:23:40,950 --> 02:23:41,970
So I waited.

5511
02:23:41,971 --> 02:23:42,990
I sorta set that ambush.

5512
02:23:42,991 --> 02:23:44,180
We were waiting for the
guy to throw a punch,

5513
02:23:44,181 --> 02:23:45,150
throw kick and you shoe.

5514
02:23:45,690 --> 02:23:46,171
And,

5515
02:23:46,171 --> 02:23:46,470
uh,

5516
02:23:46,470 --> 02:23:47,071
that happened,

5517
02:23:47,071 --> 02:23:47,191
you know,

5518
02:23:47,191 --> 02:23:47,830
he kicked me in the,

5519
02:23:47,830 --> 02:23:50,610
in the ribs and a at the same,

5520
02:23:50,611 --> 02:23:51,870
same second I shot.

5521
02:23:51,871 --> 02:23:53,430
And it was this great moment in my life.

5522
02:23:53,490 --> 02:23:54,990
It was almost better than
the bull riding moment.

5523
02:23:55,450 --> 02:23:55,860
Um,

5524
02:23:55,860 --> 02:23:56,700
there's this great picture.

5525
02:23:56,701 --> 02:23:56,971
I got 'em,

5526
02:23:56,971 --> 02:23:57,660
you know,

5527
02:23:57,660 --> 02:23:58,530
perfect double leg,

5528
02:23:58,531 --> 02:23:59,280
take down,

5529
02:23:59,280 --> 02:23:59,491
you know,

5530
02:23:59,491 --> 02:24:01,900
he's airborne and we come down hard smack.

5531
02:24:02,180 --> 02:24:02,580
Um,

5532
02:24:02,580 --> 02:24:02,960
and,

5533
02:24:02,960 --> 02:24:05,370
and at this point I feel
like I'm in control.

5534
02:24:05,370 --> 02:24:05,821
This fight,

5535
02:24:05,821 --> 02:24:06,211
I'm winning,

5536
02:24:06,211 --> 02:24:07,170
everything is going great.

5537
02:24:07,590 --> 02:24:08,130
Uh,

5538
02:24:08,130 --> 02:24:09,990
and the next thing I know,

5539
02:24:10,020 --> 02:24:10,381
I mean,

5540
02:24:10,381 --> 02:24:10,921
one second,

5541
02:24:10,921 --> 02:24:11,910
two seconds later,

5542
02:24:12,120 --> 02:24:12,870
uh,

5543
02:24:12,870 --> 02:24:14,700
he'd somehow swept me.

5544
02:24:14,701 --> 02:24:15,001
It was like,

5545
02:24:15,001 --> 02:24:15,630
it wasn't,

5546
02:24:15,630 --> 02:24:16,830
it was a fancy arm bar.

5547
02:24:16,920 --> 02:24:17,161
You know,

5548
02:24:17,161 --> 02:24:17,281
I'm,

5549
02:24:17,281 --> 02:24:17,480
I'm,

5550
02:24:17,480 --> 02:24:17,850
I'm,

5551
02:24:17,850 --> 02:24:19,170
I was a white belt at best,

5552
02:24:19,510 --> 02:24:19,820
um,

5553
02:24:19,820 --> 02:24:23,400
and it's a fancy arm bar where he
managed to sort of flipped me over like a

5554
02:24:23,401 --> 02:24:24,450
pancake and,

5555
02:24:24,451 --> 02:24:24,760
you know,

5556
02:24:24,760 --> 02:24:28,380
next thing I know I'm looking up at the
ceiling instead of looking down and it

5557
02:24:28,381 --> 02:24:29,850
was tight and it was just watch it.

5558
02:24:30,240 --> 02:24:30,781
I watched it.

5559
02:24:30,781 --> 02:24:31,170
Yeah.

5560
02:24:31,170 --> 02:24:33,060
But it took me a while to even
figure out what he had done.

5561
02:24:33,090 --> 02:24:34,230
Is it available online?

5562
02:24:34,560 --> 02:24:35,130
Uh,

5563
02:24:35,130 --> 02:24:35,520
no,

5564
02:24:35,520 --> 02:24:36,310
I don't think so.

5565
02:24:36,310 --> 02:24:37,260
I have the video.

5566
02:24:37,290 --> 02:24:39,330
I could show you what I'd
like to see a transition.

5567
02:24:39,331 --> 02:24:40,140
Yeah.

5568
02:24:40,140 --> 02:24:40,710
What he did.

5569
02:24:40,710 --> 02:24:41,040
I,

5570
02:24:41,040 --> 02:24:41,640
I could,

5571
02:24:41,640 --> 02:24:44,550
I could show you like we could get on
the ground here and I can show you.

5572
02:24:44,610 --> 02:24:45,051
Okay.

5573
02:24:45,051 --> 02:24:45,190
You,

5574
02:24:45,190 --> 02:24:45,651
you see,

5575
02:24:45,651 --> 02:24:45,901
you,

5576
02:24:45,901 --> 02:24:46,651
I'm sure we really,

5577
02:24:46,651 --> 02:24:47,484
really basic,

5578
02:24:47,490 --> 02:24:48,360
super basic.

5579
02:24:48,660 --> 02:24:49,470
But you know,

5580
02:24:49,470 --> 02:24:50,131
for me,

5581
02:24:50,131 --> 02:24:50,640
my,

5582
02:24:50,640 --> 02:24:50,851
you know,

5583
02:24:50,851 --> 02:24:53,220
I'm only a year into this at this
point in my Jujitsu was pretty,

5584
02:24:53,320 --> 02:24:53,980
uh,

5585
02:24:53,980 --> 02:24:55,290
it was pretty rudimentary.

5586
02:24:55,860 --> 02:24:56,760
One of the things,

5587
02:24:56,761 --> 02:25:01,761
and this is going to seem weird that I've
been noticing about a yoga is getting

5588
02:25:02,521 --> 02:25:07,170
into yoga again recently is the
various complexities of each position.

5589
02:25:07,400 --> 02:25:08,160
It's not,

5590
02:25:08,160 --> 02:25:09,810
it's not as simple as like,

5591
02:25:09,811 --> 02:25:10,531
put your leg here,

5592
02:25:10,531 --> 02:25:11,070
stand up,

5593
02:25:11,070 --> 02:25:16,070
there's like back has to be straight
and you expand your chest back,

5594
02:25:16,530 --> 02:25:18,210
push down with your heels,

5595
02:25:18,211 --> 02:25:18,481
you know,

5596
02:25:18,481 --> 02:25:19,440
push your hips forward.

5597
02:25:19,441 --> 02:25:21,150
There's all these different
variables that you have to take.

5598
02:25:21,151 --> 02:25:23,350
Any consideration and
every single posture will,

5599
02:25:23,680 --> 02:25:24,190
the same

5600
02:25:24,190 --> 02:25:27,760
exists in Jujitsu just on
a much more complex level.

5601
02:25:27,761 --> 02:25:31,360
There's so much because you're attacking
someone and then they're defending and

5602
02:25:31,361 --> 02:25:35,590
then you're anticipating the defense and
setting up a second attack off of that

5603
02:25:35,591 --> 02:25:36,161
defense.

5604
02:25:36,161 --> 02:25:40,150
Oftentimes the first attack is just
to gauge how they will respond.

5605
02:25:40,151 --> 02:25:40,401
And then,

5606
02:25:40,401 --> 02:25:40,811
you know,

5607
02:25:40,811 --> 02:25:42,220
and there's the chaining,

5608
02:25:42,221 --> 02:25:47,020
all the like Helson Gracie of Steve
Maxwell's famous of strength and

5609
02:25:47,021 --> 02:25:47,854
conditioning coach,

5610
02:25:48,050 --> 02:25:49,150
Jujitsu black belt,

5611
02:25:49,370 --> 02:25:50,130
um,

5612
02:25:50,130 --> 02:25:51,400
been on this podcast a few times,

5613
02:25:51,640 --> 02:25:54,940
described how Helson Gracie
describes Jujitsu and he goes,

5614
02:25:54,941 --> 02:25:55,750
uh,

5615
02:25:55,750 --> 02:25:56,291
cause he's got,

5616
02:25:56,291 --> 02:25:56,501
you know,

5617
02:25:56,501 --> 02:25:58,510
kind of a pre deep accent and he goes,

5618
02:25:58,810 --> 02:25:59,830
you do this,

5619
02:25:59,890 --> 02:26:00,940
then I do that,

5620
02:26:01,180 --> 02:26:02,230
then I do this.

5621
02:26:02,260 --> 02:26:03,970
Then you do that forever.

5622
02:26:05,580 --> 02:26:05,800
Yeah,

5623
02:26:05,800 --> 02:26:06,220
that's good.

5624
02:26:06,220 --> 02:26:07,800
It's a great way to describe it.

5625
02:26:08,180 --> 02:26:11,710
And the more you understand
about each position,

5626
02:26:11,711 --> 02:26:14,080
the more you understand about where,

5627
02:26:14,081 --> 02:26:15,310
where could things go wrong,

5628
02:26:15,311 --> 02:26:16,061
where can things go,

5629
02:26:16,061 --> 02:26:16,420
right?

5630
02:26:16,420 --> 02:26:16,721
What,

5631
02:26:16,721 --> 02:26:17,021
what,

5632
02:26:17,021 --> 02:26:18,190
what are you trying to achieve?

5633
02:26:18,670 --> 02:26:19,960
And when you don't know that,

5634
02:26:20,350 --> 02:26:20,860
like you,

5635
02:26:20,860 --> 02:26:21,930
the way you're describing it,

5636
02:26:21,931 --> 02:26:22,210
you're like,

5637
02:26:22,210 --> 02:26:22,960
what's happening?

5638
02:26:22,960 --> 02:26:24,910
I had no idea how am I this or that.

5639
02:26:25,150 --> 02:26:26,530
He did this and it was over.

5640
02:26:26,940 --> 02:26:28,240
And so my husband was like,

5641
02:26:28,300 --> 02:26:28,601
why?

5642
02:26:28,601 --> 02:26:29,650
I wanted to fight again,

5643
02:26:29,710 --> 02:26:32,920
like right then afterwards
was because I knew that,

5644
02:26:33,130 --> 02:26:33,570
you know,

5645
02:26:33,570 --> 02:26:36,580
I had chosen exactly the wrong game
plan to fight this guy and afterwards we

5646
02:26:36,581 --> 02:26:40,990
became Facebook friends and I see all
of his pictures on his Facebook page,

5647
02:26:41,480 --> 02:26:45,490
Him with gold medals on his chest from
winning Jujitsu competition tournament.

5648
02:26:45,491 --> 02:26:45,821
Yeah.

5649
02:26:45,821 --> 02:26:47,890
So he's [inaudible] out of my league.

5650
02:26:47,940 --> 02:26:48,773
Is he a black belt?

5651
02:26:49,090 --> 02:26:50,080
I don't believe so.

5652
02:26:50,100 --> 02:26:50,933
Uh,

5653
02:26:51,010 --> 02:26:51,521
but yeah,

5654
02:26:51,521 --> 02:26:52,410
he was up there.

5655
02:26:53,230 --> 02:26:57,340
Have you considered just really training
hard as you did to try to look through?

5656
02:26:57,341 --> 02:26:57,860
I'd like to do,

5657
02:26:57,860 --> 02:26:58,480
yeah,

5658
02:26:58,480 --> 02:27:02,230
I can get help if I can get
healthy and 42 it's tough.

5659
02:27:02,290 --> 02:27:03,123
I know.

5660
02:27:03,430 --> 02:27:06,250
Well the problem with me is know this
is why I think I had so many physical

5661
02:27:06,251 --> 02:27:06,731
problems.

5662
02:27:06,731 --> 02:27:10,030
It's like there is a nature
and nurture to flexibility.

5663
02:27:10,450 --> 02:27:10,691
You know,

5664
02:27:10,691 --> 02:27:11,411
some people have,

5665
02:27:11,411 --> 02:27:11,591
you know,

5666
02:27:11,591 --> 02:27:13,630
some people have really high
vertical leap by just by nature.

5667
02:27:13,631 --> 02:27:13,990
You know,

5668
02:27:13,990 --> 02:27:15,070
some people were really flexible.

5669
02:27:15,071 --> 02:27:15,281
It just,

5670
02:27:15,281 --> 02:27:20,281
by nature I appear to be the Chi who's
not very flexible by nature when I work

5671
02:27:20,291 --> 02:27:20,981
on it really hard.

5672
02:27:20,981 --> 02:27:21,461
But boy,

5673
02:27:21,461 --> 02:27:25,030
I just don't seem to get
much more flexibility oppose
that because no one in my

5674
02:27:25,031 --> 02:27:26,440
family is flexible by button.

5675
02:27:26,441 --> 02:27:26,950
Me.

5676
02:27:26,950 --> 02:27:30,940
And the reason why I'm flexible is
because my body developed by stretching.

5677
02:27:31,060 --> 02:27:33,640
I mean I was stretching from
the time I was really young.

5678
02:27:34,220 --> 02:27:36,240
That could be a starting when
you're young and supple him.

5679
02:27:36,250 --> 02:27:38,620
But when I was in my
early twenties you know,

5680
02:27:38,740 --> 02:27:40,090
if you're doing karate,

5681
02:27:40,390 --> 02:27:42,990
there's a lot of stuff
you just can't do if you,

5682
02:27:43,390 --> 02:27:44,470
if you're not very flexible.

5683
02:27:44,650 --> 02:27:45,790
And so I worked on really hard.

5684
02:27:45,791 --> 02:27:48,040
Well there was a guy that used
to come to our Jujitsu gym.

5685
02:27:48,041 --> 02:27:49,360
This is one of the reasons why I pose it.

5686
02:27:49,361 --> 02:27:53,590
And he was just big fucking football
player and he was like 250 pounds.

5687
02:27:53,591 --> 02:27:54,550
And whenever I used to roll with them,

5688
02:27:54,551 --> 02:27:58,000
I used to literally say I'm going to
go ride the bull because that was,

5689
02:27:58,030 --> 02:27:58,721
that was what was,

5690
02:27:58,721 --> 02:28:00,880
it was like rolling with him.

5691
02:28:00,881 --> 02:28:01,870
Like he wasn't good.

5692
02:28:02,020 --> 02:28:04,930
I think I was a brown belt and I
think he was a white belt at the time.

5693
02:28:05,320 --> 02:28:06,820
And so I would always get them.

5694
02:28:06,970 --> 02:28:08,440
But it would be a while.

5695
02:28:08,700 --> 02:28:09,640
I mean it would be like,

5696
02:28:09,730 --> 02:28:10,900
ah fuck you,

5697
02:28:11,190 --> 02:28:14,290
like hanging onto this guy for
a long time and riding the bull.

5698
02:28:14,470 --> 02:28:19,360
But this guy was a dedicated athlete
and one of the things that he did was he

5699
02:28:19,570 --> 02:28:22,160
radically improved his while he was there

5700
02:28:22,340 --> 02:28:23,540
when he first started out.

5701
02:28:23,780 --> 02:28:26,810
You know how you sit there like with
your legs in a butterfly position and you

5702
02:28:26,811 --> 02:28:27,441
try to push your,

5703
02:28:27,441 --> 02:28:27,831
your,

5704
02:28:27,831 --> 02:28:29,090
your knees down to the ground.

5705
02:28:29,390 --> 02:28:30,740
He couldn't even come close.

5706
02:28:30,741 --> 02:28:32,630
His knees are like stock up like this.

5707
02:28:33,050 --> 02:28:34,220
He couldn't push them down and all,

5708
02:28:34,221 --> 02:28:38,360
but that fucking guy would be there
after class for 40 minutes longer than

5709
02:28:38,361 --> 02:28:39,021
anybody else.

5710
02:28:39,021 --> 02:28:40,040
Just stretching,

5711
02:28:40,310 --> 02:28:40,820
stretching,

5712
02:28:40,820 --> 02:28:45,200
just pushing his soft tissue
to the limit every day.

5713
02:28:45,290 --> 02:28:49,310
And it's that kind of dedication
that led to a year plus later.

5714
02:28:49,311 --> 02:28:50,750
Like my friend Eddie Bravo,

5715
02:28:50,770 --> 02:28:52,990
my Jujitsu instructor as well,

5716
02:28:53,240 --> 02:28:55,310
he always talks about that guy.

5717
02:28:55,311 --> 02:28:57,860
This one guy he fucking put in the time,

5718
02:28:58,150 --> 02:29:00,230
put in the numbers and
he got really flexible.

5719
02:29:00,530 --> 02:29:00,891
I mean,

5720
02:29:00,891 --> 02:29:03,590
he was almost had a full split
after like a year and a half,

5721
02:29:03,920 --> 02:29:07,370
but it was the kind of dedication
that led him to be a football player.

5722
02:29:07,700 --> 02:29:09,890
I mean he was a professional
athlete and he just,

5723
02:29:09,891 --> 02:29:14,360
this guy just fucking put on the
blinders and went for flexibility.

5724
02:29:14,361 --> 02:29:16,580
He knew he was ridiculously strong.

5725
02:29:16,581 --> 02:29:18,440
He knew he was ridiculously powerful.

5726
02:29:18,590 --> 02:29:21,790
So he had to learn the technique and
you had to get flexible and so he,

5727
02:29:21,820 --> 02:29:22,251
he,

5728
02:29:22,251 --> 02:29:23,120
I saw him do it,

5729
02:29:23,121 --> 02:29:23,391
man.

5730
02:29:23,391 --> 02:29:24,680
I saw it take place.

5731
02:29:24,681 --> 02:29:25,530
So whenever,

5732
02:29:25,540 --> 02:29:26,870
when someone says they said,

5733
02:29:26,871 --> 02:29:26,991
Oh,

5734
02:29:26,991 --> 02:29:29,660
you'll have certain
restrictions in this certain,

5735
02:29:29,661 --> 02:29:30,500
it was only Sophie.

5736
02:29:30,650 --> 02:29:31,341
That's all the time.

5737
02:29:31,341 --> 02:29:34,970
You say that not everyone's
given the same genetic gifts.

5738
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:35,833
Yes,

5739
02:29:35,990 --> 02:29:37,040
no doubt about that.

5740
02:29:37,041 --> 02:29:38,630
When it comes to Fast Eddie Bravo,

5741
02:29:38,660 --> 02:29:38,881
you know,

5742
02:29:38,881 --> 02:29:40,260
like he's just a freak.

5743
02:29:40,300 --> 02:29:43,150
He has some freakish flexibility
in some areas he does,

5744
02:29:43,151 --> 02:29:43,984
but it's also,

5745
02:29:44,240 --> 02:29:47,450
he's stretched those areas ad nauseum.

5746
02:29:47,480 --> 02:29:48,081
I mean that guy,

5747
02:29:48,081 --> 02:29:50,810
you'd be watching TV with him and
he's pulling his foot to his chest.

5748
02:29:51,170 --> 02:29:52,490
Like seriously everywhere too though.

5749
02:29:52,490 --> 02:29:52,811
I watched,

5750
02:29:52,811 --> 02:29:53,321
I watched TV.

5751
02:29:53,321 --> 02:29:54,320
I'm going to instruct the whole time.

5752
02:29:54,770 --> 02:29:55,510
I don't,

5753
02:29:55,510 --> 02:29:55,810
you know,

5754
02:29:55,810 --> 02:29:57,050
I don't know how much you're stretched.

5755
02:29:57,320 --> 02:29:58,101
I don't know how much you stretch,

5756
02:29:58,101 --> 02:30:01,520
but I do know that I watched this guy do
it and I watched this guy get way more

5757
02:30:01,521 --> 02:30:02,810
flexible and it was amazing.

5758
02:30:02,811 --> 02:30:05,310
But this is what my point is,

5759
02:30:05,311 --> 02:30:08,540
is like there are unquestionably
physical gifts that you can't,

5760
02:30:08,990 --> 02:30:10,880
you can't achieve like fast twitch,

5761
02:30:10,881 --> 02:30:11,540
muscle fibers,

5762
02:30:11,540 --> 02:30:14,480
speed and power cardio to cardio.

5763
02:30:14,510 --> 02:30:17,090
Cain Velasquez is the one
that they always bring up,

5764
02:30:17,750 --> 02:30:19,130
size of bones,

5765
02:30:19,190 --> 02:30:20,290
size of the hands,

5766
02:30:20,300 --> 02:30:21,620
the width of the shoulders,

5767
02:30:22,010 --> 02:30:23,990
all those things contribute to power.

5768
02:30:24,020 --> 02:30:26,270
And also like the explosion,

5769
02:30:26,271 --> 02:30:27,170
like the fast guys,

5770
02:30:27,171 --> 02:30:29,060
like a guy like Uriah hall,

5771
02:30:29,210 --> 02:30:33,260
like Uriah Hall without a doubt is
trained very hard and well prepared and he

5772
02:30:33,261 --> 02:30:34,340
has excellent technique.

5773
02:30:34,640 --> 02:30:37,910
But you watch your Riaa hall shoot a
straight right hand and you're like,

5774
02:30:37,940 --> 02:30:38,361
okay,

5775
02:30:38,361 --> 02:30:41,180
like I don't know how many
guys can do at that fast.

5776
02:30:41,510 --> 02:30:42,080
He'll,

5777
02:30:42,080 --> 02:30:45,050
he'll be like moving around and
all of a sudden you're like,

5778
02:30:45,051 --> 02:30:48,950
lean in with this right hand that cut
and you see the look on the guy's face

5779
02:30:48,951 --> 02:30:51,240
after he got hit where he
realizes like what just happened?

5780
02:30:51,350 --> 02:30:52,280
Whoa.

5781
02:30:52,281 --> 02:30:54,520
Like this guy's got some next level speed.

5782
02:30:54,530 --> 02:30:56,780
Like I was talking to your rise
coaches after one of his fights.

5783
02:30:56,781 --> 02:30:56,991
He's like,

5784
02:30:56,991 --> 02:30:58,640
he's the fastest fucking
guy I've ever seen.

5785
02:30:59,210 --> 02:31:00,110
Like the fastest guy.

5786
02:31:00,111 --> 02:31:01,070
Like you see him in the gym.

5787
02:31:01,071 --> 02:31:05,030
I mean he is so fucking
fast and some of that is,

5788
02:31:05,210 --> 02:31:06,260
I mean some,

5789
02:31:06,590 --> 02:31:09,800
some portion of that is
unattainable for the average person.

5790
02:31:10,700 --> 02:31:11,120
Yeah.

5791
02:31:11,120 --> 02:31:12,170
That's just the reality.

5792
02:31:12,830 --> 02:31:14,400
But it does.

5793
02:31:14,401 --> 02:31:16,070
Where do you think be
different for flexibility?

5794
02:31:16,230 --> 02:31:20,010
I think flexibility is something
that you can push because

5795
02:31:20,010 --> 02:31:23,180
it's just a matter of how
far your soft cardio toes.

5796
02:31:23,320 --> 02:31:23,611
No,

5797
02:31:23,611 --> 02:31:24,161
not really.

5798
02:31:24,161 --> 02:31:25,020
Can't push like crazy.

5799
02:31:25,690 --> 02:31:26,220
There's a linen.

5800
02:31:26,220 --> 02:31:27,720
Cassidy though is different.

5801
02:31:27,721 --> 02:31:29,520
The size of the heart
is different like this.

5802
02:31:29,521 --> 02:31:31,320
One of the things that we
said about Lance Armstrong,

5803
02:31:31,380 --> 02:31:33,180
he has an enormous heart
and that's part of,

5804
02:31:33,210 --> 02:31:33,801
that's part of it.

5805
02:31:33,801 --> 02:31:34,710
The training too though,

5806
02:31:34,950 --> 02:31:36,810
could be when you grow
the harder to muscle,

5807
02:31:37,100 --> 02:31:38,430
it atrophies.

5808
02:31:38,610 --> 02:31:42,060
It hypertrophies plus all
the shit that he took.

5809
02:31:42,620 --> 02:31:47,620
Crimes injecting steroids and one of
those ones from pulp fiction when they

5810
02:31:47,911 --> 02:31:48,744
revived.

5811
02:31:52,710 --> 02:31:53,191
Who knows?

5812
02:31:53,191 --> 02:31:53,610
Man,

5813
02:31:53,610 --> 02:31:54,090
who knows.

5814
02:31:54,090 --> 02:31:56,700
I just think that flexibility
is a little bit more simple.

5815
02:31:56,701 --> 02:31:59,940
I don't think you could
achieve the flexibility of
say like you have an anecdote

5816
02:32:00,150 --> 02:32:01,050
or you have your big friend.

5817
02:32:01,470 --> 02:32:02,430
I'm saying that I think I'm,

5818
02:32:02,431 --> 02:32:04,080
the other anecdote might be,

5819
02:32:04,440 --> 02:32:05,910
I've never seen you stretch though.

5820
02:32:05,980 --> 02:32:06,660
We'll do it after.

5821
02:32:06,660 --> 02:32:07,170
Okay,

5822
02:32:07,170 --> 02:32:07,740
let's see.

5823
02:32:07,740 --> 02:32:08,840
See how hard you push it.

5824
02:32:09,310 --> 02:32:11,600
Cause some people get to
a certain point like Ah,

5825
02:32:11,610 --> 02:32:12,001
okay,

5826
02:32:12,001 --> 02:32:12,211
okay,

5827
02:32:12,211 --> 02:32:12,860
okay,

5828
02:32:12,860 --> 02:32:14,280
but you got to get to that super,

5829
02:32:14,281 --> 02:32:16,830
I can't breathe point and
you gotta push that bitch.

5830
02:32:17,120 --> 02:32:17,953
It's just,

5831
02:32:18,450 --> 02:32:20,400
it's also like how do you do it?

5832
02:32:20,401 --> 02:32:21,630
Do you do it correctly?

5833
02:32:21,631 --> 02:32:24,030
Do you have someone who's
pushing you correctly in what,

5834
02:32:24,031 --> 02:32:25,260
where are you starting out from?

5835
02:32:25,261 --> 02:32:30,261
You starting out from 39 40 years of doing
Jack Shit to stretch out and then all

5836
02:32:30,901 --> 02:32:35,490
of a sudden you're trying to take
these mature older muscles and,

5837
02:32:35,540 --> 02:32:36,780
and pull them up on a big part.

5838
02:32:36,810 --> 02:32:37,643
That's a big part of that.

5839
02:32:37,650 --> 02:32:38,200
That's right.

5840
02:32:38,200 --> 02:32:40,140
If I've been sitting on a
desk for years and years,

5841
02:32:40,320 --> 02:32:42,810
I mean if somebody got ahold
of you when you were 16,

5842
02:32:43,110 --> 02:32:43,943
that's very possible.

5843
02:32:43,980 --> 02:32:46,250
And when you were doing Kyokushin did,

5844
02:32:46,370 --> 02:32:46,830
did,

5845
02:32:46,830 --> 02:32:49,140
did your school really
emphasize stretching?

5846
02:32:49,650 --> 02:32:50,380
I did.

5847
02:32:50,380 --> 02:32:50,701
You know,

5848
02:32:50,701 --> 02:32:51,480
cause I knew,

5849
02:32:51,480 --> 02:32:54,930
well I knew I couldn't kick guys in the
head and I knew I wanted to be able to,

5850
02:32:55,020 --> 02:32:55,291
you know,

5851
02:32:55,291 --> 02:32:56,730
cause that's a big part of
it is all kinds of kicks.

5852
02:32:56,731 --> 02:32:58,260
I get all kinds of cool
stuff I couldn't do.

5853
02:32:58,740 --> 02:32:59,850
So I got stretching machine,

5854
02:32:59,851 --> 02:33:00,111
you know,

5855
02:33:00,111 --> 02:33:00,450
I,

5856
02:33:00,450 --> 02:33:01,680
well it was chuck Norris jammies.

5857
02:33:01,790 --> 02:33:05,280
I know chuck north of knockoff
version cause it was cheaper.

5858
02:33:05,300 --> 02:33:06,030
Uh,

5859
02:33:06,030 --> 02:33:06,550
no crank.

5860
02:33:06,550 --> 02:33:06,850
No,

5861
02:33:06,850 --> 02:33:07,530
you'd have a crank.

5862
02:33:07,530 --> 02:33:07,711
No,

5863
02:33:07,711 --> 02:33:08,990
mine was different was it was like,

5864
02:33:08,991 --> 02:33:11,370
what's some kind of like PVC.

5865
02:33:11,550 --> 02:33:11,881
Okay,

5866
02:33:11,881 --> 02:33:12,471
I know that time.

5867
02:33:12,471 --> 02:33:12,720
Yeah.

5868
02:33:12,720 --> 02:33:13,111
Yeah.

5869
02:33:13,111 --> 02:33:14,960
It was like a pilot picture par,

5870
02:33:15,030 --> 02:33:18,600
you pull it and stretch
exactly those do a little bit,

5871
02:33:18,601 --> 02:33:23,160
but realistically you don't need that
which you really need is just someone who

5872
02:33:23,161 --> 02:33:25,080
can help you and push you back down.

5873
02:33:25,110 --> 02:33:28,080
And then also the ability
to withstand pain.

5874
02:33:28,710 --> 02:33:29,281
That's it.

5875
02:33:29,281 --> 02:33:32,640
The uncomfortable feeling of
pushing your muscles to limit.

5876
02:33:32,840 --> 02:33:33,450
Yeah.

5877
02:33:33,450 --> 02:33:35,910
I don't mind that it's hard to,

5878
02:33:35,911 --> 02:33:36,211
uh,

5879
02:33:36,211 --> 02:33:38,700
it's hard to change
your body in many ways.

5880
02:33:38,701 --> 02:33:42,270
It's hard to develop more muscle
because your body doesn't want to,

5881
02:33:42,271 --> 02:33:43,560
your body doesn't want to change.

5882
02:33:43,561 --> 02:33:43,710
You know,

5883
02:33:43,710 --> 02:33:48,060
your body just wants to get really sore
and then discourage you from continuing

5884
02:33:48,061 --> 02:33:51,720
to lift right now in order to
force your body to gain weight.

5885
02:33:51,721 --> 02:33:52,501
Like if someone say to me,

5886
02:33:52,501 --> 02:33:52,801
hey man,

5887
02:33:52,801 --> 02:33:56,520
I want to put on about five pounds of
muscle while you're going to have to work

5888
02:33:56,521 --> 02:33:57,870
out three days a week,

5889
02:33:57,900 --> 02:33:59,610
like a madman for a year,

5890
02:33:59,880 --> 02:34:00,713
good luck.

5891
02:34:01,010 --> 02:34:01,290
You know,

5892
02:34:01,290 --> 02:34:03,870
there's one thing if you're a
dedicated professional athlete,

5893
02:34:03,871 --> 02:34:06,900
you've been doing it a long time and
your body knows how to grow and there's a

5894
02:34:06,901 --> 02:34:11,340
certain amount of also muscle memory
that comes into play when you see someone

5895
02:34:11,341 --> 02:34:13,260
who is a really big,

5896
02:34:13,440 --> 02:34:14,530
but then they lose the,

5897
02:34:14,640 --> 02:34:15,660
the muscle mass.

5898
02:34:15,690 --> 02:34:17,920
Like maybe they'll get into something
else and we'll stop lifting.

5899
02:34:17,980 --> 02:34:21,190
They can get really big way
quicker than the average person.

5900
02:34:22,200 --> 02:34:22,811
It's no,

5901
02:34:22,811 --> 02:34:23,644
it's a fact.

5902
02:34:23,860 --> 02:34:24,880
Like say if you,

5903
02:34:24,910 --> 02:34:26,890
if you used to weigh 230 pounds,

5904
02:34:26,891 --> 02:34:30,160
you big fucking giant dude and
then you dropped down to one 70,

5905
02:34:30,161 --> 02:34:30,911
you could gain,

5906
02:34:30,911 --> 02:34:34,880
like if you took two dudes that
weighed one 70 and they're both,

5907
02:34:34,910 --> 02:34:35,200
you know,

5908
02:34:35,200 --> 02:34:37,840
reasonably fit and one of
them used to be enormous,

5909
02:34:37,870 --> 02:34:39,100
he will get bigger quicker.

5910
02:34:39,400 --> 02:34:40,330
It's just muscle memory.

5911
02:34:40,410 --> 02:34:41,110
Yeah.

5912
02:34:41,110 --> 02:34:41,590
There's no,

5913
02:34:41,590 --> 02:34:42,760
there's no getting around that,

5914
02:34:43,510 --> 02:34:45,490
but your body doesn't want to do it.

5915
02:34:46,730 --> 02:34:47,080
It's,

5916
02:34:47,080 --> 02:34:47,321
you,

5917
02:34:47,321 --> 02:34:49,270
you have to really push that bitch.

5918
02:34:49,330 --> 02:34:53,320
And I think the same takes place
with flexibility and the same.

5919
02:34:53,350 --> 02:34:53,770
Um,

5920
02:34:53,770 --> 02:34:55,930
the same holds true with,

5921
02:34:55,931 --> 02:34:56,260
uh,

5922
02:34:56,260 --> 02:34:57,130
with gains,

5923
02:34:57,430 --> 02:34:58,370
with size gains.

5924
02:34:58,390 --> 02:34:59,590
It's very difficult to do.

5925
02:34:59,730 --> 02:35:00,563
Yeah,

5926
02:35:00,850 --> 02:35:04,240
you have to be willing to push your body
to this really uncomfortable position

5927
02:35:04,241 --> 02:35:07,090
and then you have to fuel
it with all sorts of food.

5928
02:35:07,930 --> 02:35:08,171
It's like,

5929
02:35:08,171 --> 02:35:08,281
hey,

5930
02:35:08,281 --> 02:35:11,200
didn't kick out of
whenever people compare,

5931
02:35:11,260 --> 02:35:12,140
like it's,

5932
02:35:12,160 --> 02:35:16,060
it's a funny thing like it happens on
my message board on my forum sometimes,

5933
02:35:16,330 --> 02:35:19,540
like people start talking about diets
and caloric requirements and then they'll

5934
02:35:19,541 --> 02:35:20,860
bring up like Michael Phelps.

5935
02:35:21,130 --> 02:35:21,281
Well,

5936
02:35:21,281 --> 02:35:25,630
Michael Phelps ate 15 fucking
pizzas a day and he did like,

5937
02:35:25,631 --> 02:35:30,400
do you have any idea how hard
Michael Phelps works out?

5938
02:35:30,420 --> 02:35:30,790
Yeah.

5939
02:35:30,790 --> 02:35:33,930
Don't ever fucking compare
yourself to Michael to stop.

5940
02:35:34,210 --> 02:35:39,210
He's in the greatest Olympic swimmer
the world has ever known and whatever

5941
02:35:39,641 --> 02:35:41,110
genetic gifts he has,

5942
02:35:41,530 --> 02:35:46,300
they were unquestionably accentuated
by a barbaric worth ethic.

5943
02:35:46,810 --> 02:35:47,643
And we,

5944
02:35:48,130 --> 02:35:48,963
those things helped.

5945
02:35:49,180 --> 02:35:50,900
I think that we'd help
them recover and he's six,

5946
02:35:50,901 --> 02:35:52,060
seven or eight big,

5947
02:35:52,061 --> 02:35:54,310
giant fucking long dude.

5948
02:35:54,520 --> 02:35:58,090
But also the amount of calories
that guy was burning every day.

5949
02:35:58,300 --> 02:36:00,640
The average person really can't relate.

5950
02:36:00,790 --> 02:36:01,330
You just,

5951
02:36:01,330 --> 02:36:02,163
you can't relate.

5952
02:36:02,200 --> 02:36:02,590
No.

5953
02:36:02,590 --> 02:36:06,100
Like the amount of effort that
it takes to be a Chris Weidman,

5954
02:36:06,130 --> 02:36:09,970
the kind of training camps at
Vitor Belfort goes through what,

5955
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:10,301
you know,

5956
02:36:10,301 --> 02:36:12,810
what Jon Jones went through when
you train for Daniel Columbian.

5957
02:36:12,810 --> 02:36:13,643
It'd be interesting when,

5958
02:36:13,790 --> 02:36:14,100
when the,

5959
02:36:14,100 --> 02:36:15,460
with the stronger drug testing,

5960
02:36:16,160 --> 02:36:18,400
see if these guys can go
through these kinds of camps.

5961
02:36:18,870 --> 02:36:19,840
You've got a very good point.

5962
02:36:19,860 --> 02:36:20,620
Yeah.

5963
02:36:20,620 --> 02:36:21,311
Well that's the,

5964
02:36:21,311 --> 02:36:22,600
that's the dirty secret,

5965
02:36:23,040 --> 02:36:23,320
you know,

5966
02:36:23,320 --> 02:36:27,880
that's sort of being slowly but
surely revealed for the longest time.

5967
02:36:27,881 --> 02:36:29,770
There's certain things
that you couldn't test for,

5968
02:36:29,771 --> 02:36:30,790
like growth hormone.

5969
02:36:30,820 --> 02:36:32,020
You couldn't even find it.

5970
02:36:32,200 --> 02:36:33,010
You know,

5971
02:36:33,010 --> 02:36:37,120
I had a conversation with jail
son and after he got popped and,

5972
02:36:37,121 --> 02:36:37,391
uh,

5973
02:36:37,391 --> 02:36:37,730
you know,

5974
02:36:37,730 --> 02:36:40,690
he wanted to talk to me on the phone
about like how we should approach it.

5975
02:36:40,840 --> 02:36:41,650
And um,

5976
02:36:41,650 --> 02:36:42,670
Chels a funny guy,

5977
02:36:42,671 --> 02:36:43,504
man,

5978
02:36:43,790 --> 02:36:44,980
he's fucking hilarious.

5979
02:36:45,010 --> 02:36:46,480
He's a great shit talker too.

5980
02:36:46,780 --> 02:36:47,081
But,

5981
02:36:47,081 --> 02:36:47,350
uh,

5982
02:36:47,350 --> 02:36:47,831
he goes,

5983
02:36:47,831 --> 02:36:48,131
yeah,

5984
02:36:48,131 --> 02:36:48,341
you know,

5985
02:36:48,341 --> 02:36:51,130
those drug tests turns
out they're really good,

5986
02:36:52,890 --> 02:36:55,870
got caught for all sorts of shit that
he never thought he'd get caught for

5987
02:36:56,410 --> 02:36:58,210
growth hormone EPO.

5988
02:36:58,440 --> 02:36:58,870
Aw,

5989
02:36:58,870 --> 02:36:59,080
yeah.

5990
02:36:59,080 --> 02:37:00,250
He had a cocktail going,

5991
02:37:01,060 --> 02:37:01,841
but you know,

5992
02:37:01,841 --> 02:37:02,621
in his mind,

5993
02:37:02,621 --> 02:37:07,621
I think he had a very small window to
achieve something and he probably was

5994
02:37:09,641 --> 02:37:12,310
correct in assuming that he
wasn't the only one doing it.

5995
02:37:12,510 --> 02:37:13,343
Yeah.

5996
02:37:13,900 --> 02:37:16,340
You just probably correct in
assuming that it's almost impossible,

5997
02:37:16,680 --> 02:37:17,481
almost impossible,

5998
02:37:17,481 --> 02:37:19,330
but it's really hard
to get to win the belt,

5999
02:37:19,840 --> 02:37:20,150
uh,

6000
02:37:20,150 --> 02:37:20,960
without it.

6001
02:37:20,960 --> 02:37:21,500
Well,

6002
02:37:21,500 --> 02:37:23,960
Josie Aldo had a really
interesting thing to say.

6003
02:37:24,410 --> 02:37:24,920
Um,

6004
02:37:24,920 --> 02:37:27,240
and Andre Panera's as well.

6005
02:37:27,350 --> 02:37:28,250
They were talking about,

6006
02:37:28,251 --> 02:37:28,910
um,

6007
02:37:28,910 --> 02:37:30,110
steroids and they were like,

6008
02:37:30,320 --> 02:37:31,153
well,

6009
02:37:31,160 --> 02:37:33,260
we support testing,

6010
02:37:33,290 --> 02:37:36,500
but I hope the UFC realizes the
fights won't be as exciting.

6011
02:37:37,290 --> 02:37:38,810
Like if fighters won't be as good,

6012
02:37:38,840 --> 02:37:38,991
well,

6013
02:37:38,991 --> 02:37:41,720
they're also going to be out of fights
more often know they're awesome not to be

6014
02:37:41,721 --> 02:37:42,171
able to make it,

6015
02:37:42,171 --> 02:37:43,004
to fight it.

6016
02:37:43,160 --> 02:37:44,210
They're not going to have the healing.

6017
02:37:44,240 --> 02:37:45,020
Uh,

6018
02:37:45,020 --> 02:37:45,560
yeah.

6019
02:37:45,560 --> 02:37:48,020
You know your wife at
all that testosterone.

6020
02:37:48,050 --> 02:37:48,391
Yeah.

6021
02:37:48,391 --> 02:37:51,440
You're red lining your body
going through camp and they bang,

6022
02:37:51,441 --> 02:37:51,831
Bang,

6023
02:37:51,831 --> 02:37:52,491
Bang,

6024
02:37:52,491 --> 02:37:55,370
things fucking break off and
selling example think they can work.

6025
02:37:55,380 --> 02:37:58,220
That's hard as they're
working without some help.

6026
02:37:58,610 --> 02:37:59,420
Some can,

6027
02:37:59,420 --> 02:38:00,650
some Canada summer clean,

6028
02:38:00,651 --> 02:38:01,700
some have always been clean.

6029
02:38:01,701 --> 02:38:02,690
Guys like Frankie Edgar,

6030
02:38:02,990 --> 02:38:04,640
these finger clean turn out not to be,

6031
02:38:04,641 --> 02:38:04,920
you know,

6032
02:38:04,920 --> 02:38:05,753
that's a problem.

6033
02:38:05,960 --> 02:38:08,090
I think fake Edgar's
almost certainly clean,

6034
02:38:08,570 --> 02:38:11,450
but who knows if he's not
eating EPL and that's,

6035
02:38:11,570 --> 02:38:11,851
you know,

6036
02:38:11,851 --> 02:38:13,850
one of the secrets to
his incredible cardio.

6037
02:38:13,851 --> 02:38:14,810
I don't think that at all.

6038
02:38:14,990 --> 02:38:16,280
But you wouldn't know it was my point.

6039
02:38:16,400 --> 02:38:17,233
Well,

6040
02:38:17,480 --> 02:38:17,960
yeah,

6041
02:38:17,960 --> 02:38:18,351
I don't know.

6042
02:38:18,351 --> 02:38:21,380
I mean John Fitch Really surprised
me when he turned positive.

6043
02:38:21,410 --> 02:38:22,350
Tons of people are surprised.

6044
02:38:22,360 --> 02:38:23,131
The Anderson Silva.

6045
02:38:23,131 --> 02:38:23,781
It was surprising.

6046
02:38:23,781 --> 02:38:24,614
Right.

6047
02:38:24,920 --> 02:38:25,960
I wish I could tell you that.

6048
02:38:26,240 --> 02:38:27,350
I'll tell you off the air.

6049
02:38:27,420 --> 02:38:27,740
Yeah.

6050
02:38:27,740 --> 02:38:30,480
I can't tell you on the air
the Anderson Silva situation,

6051
02:38:30,500 --> 02:38:31,610
but it's a bit more complicated.

6052
02:38:31,640 --> 02:38:32,060
Okay.

6053
02:38:32,060 --> 02:38:32,893
First of all,

6054
02:38:33,020 --> 02:38:35,270
he unquestionably took some for his,

6055
02:38:35,300 --> 02:38:35,720
uh,

6056
02:38:35,720 --> 02:38:37,940
leg to try to heal his leg.

6057
02:38:37,941 --> 02:38:38,840
38 years old.

6058
02:38:38,841 --> 02:38:40,420
He had a broken leg in that position.

6059
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:41,833
There's a lot.

6060
02:38:41,900 --> 02:38:42,740
And there's also,

6061
02:38:42,920 --> 02:38:44,690
I think that there is,

6062
02:38:44,691 --> 02:38:46,040
nothing is my opinion.

6063
02:38:46,160 --> 02:38:47,720
I think that it is,

6064
02:38:47,810 --> 02:38:49,340
not only is there nothing wrong,

6065
02:38:49,670 --> 02:38:54,670
but there may be a case for doctors
to prescribe some sort of steroids,

6066
02:38:55,391 --> 02:38:56,780
some controlled amount of,

6067
02:38:56,781 --> 02:39:01,781
some sort of steroids for catastrophic
injuries like massive leg breaks or you

6068
02:39:01,991 --> 02:39:02,380
know,

6069
02:39:02,380 --> 02:39:06,620
Peck terrors or there's some pretty
fucking significant injuries.

6070
02:39:06,980 --> 02:39:07,790
Here's another one.

6071
02:39:07,790 --> 02:39:08,270
Um,

6072
02:39:08,270 --> 02:39:11,090
Hector Lombard went
through a bulging disc,

6073
02:39:11,420 --> 02:39:12,080
like a sick,

6074
02:39:12,080 --> 02:39:16,160
significantly injured disc
and then was fighting,

6075
02:39:16,340 --> 02:39:16,581
you know,

6076
02:39:16,581 --> 02:39:18,620
like I think he had a fight
scheduled like six months later.

6077
02:39:19,400 --> 02:39:22,490
Good luck trying to recover from
something like that in six months.

6078
02:39:22,491 --> 02:39:23,840
I mean you kind of can,

6079
02:39:24,140 --> 02:39:27,380
but can you recover enough in three
months to go through a three month ramp?

6080
02:39:27,980 --> 02:39:28,910
Most likely not.

6081
02:39:29,060 --> 02:39:33,020
And then he turned up positive for some
designer steroid that most people didn't

6082
02:39:33,021 --> 02:39:34,160
think they were testing for.

6083
02:39:34,910 --> 02:39:35,181
You know,

6084
02:39:35,181 --> 02:39:38,660
like the whole Barry bonds thing
with the clear and all this,

6085
02:39:38,661 --> 02:39:38,901
you know,

6086
02:39:38,901 --> 02:39:39,350
this,

6087
02:39:39,350 --> 02:39:40,760
there was a lot of that going on.

6088
02:39:40,761 --> 02:39:42,310
I think inboxing,

6089
02:39:42,410 --> 02:39:43,760
there was a lot of that going on.

6090
02:39:43,820 --> 02:39:44,653
There's tons of it.

6091
02:39:45,020 --> 02:39:46,090
I mean the big giveaway.

6092
02:39:46,100 --> 02:39:47,360
So if all these old guys,

6093
02:39:48,010 --> 02:39:50,690
these guys in their forties
still competing as cage fighters,

6094
02:39:51,290 --> 02:39:52,900
well that doesn't really exist anymore.

6095
02:39:52,910 --> 02:39:53,301
I mean it was,

6096
02:39:53,301 --> 02:39:57,520
Randy was like kind of the last one
that competed at a super high level,

6097
02:39:57,650 --> 02:39:58,640
just able to do it at all.

6098
02:39:58,641 --> 02:39:59,474
And that sport,

6099
02:39:59,890 --> 02:40:00,940
you're for Nannies,

6100
02:40:00,950 --> 02:40:05,950
also an undeniable freak of nature because
Randy never got hurt and mean Randy

6101
02:40:06,021 --> 02:40:07,670
lost and he got knocked
out and stuff like that.

6102
02:40:07,671 --> 02:40:08,540
But I mean in training,

6103
02:40:08,541 --> 02:40:10,070
like he never had a surgery,

6104
02:40:10,470 --> 02:40:11,560
never had a broken hand.

6105
02:40:11,561 --> 02:40:13,230
You got his arm broken in the Gonzaga Phi,

6106
02:40:13,240 --> 02:40:13,980
but that was blocking

6107
02:40:13,980 --> 02:40:14,760
a kick.

6108
02:40:14,760 --> 02:40:17,220
He looked awfully good for
50 it's a fucking stud.

6109
02:40:17,460 --> 02:40:18,293
He's a God damn.

6110
02:40:18,420 --> 02:40:19,110
I mean that's key.

6111
02:40:19,110 --> 02:40:20,400
That's the real captain America,

6112
02:40:20,550 --> 02:40:22,410
Randy couture's a fucking stud.

6113
02:40:22,830 --> 02:40:24,030
You have to be to be able to,

6114
02:40:25,080 --> 02:40:28,500
don't you assume that he was
on something in that era?

6115
02:40:29,010 --> 02:40:30,420
Yes and no.

6116
02:40:30,660 --> 02:40:32,280
I don't have the evidence.

6117
02:40:32,440 --> 02:40:33,030
I don't want to.

6118
02:40:33,030 --> 02:40:35,520
I assume that it's very likely.

6119
02:40:35,550 --> 02:40:35,720
Well,

6120
02:40:35,720 --> 02:40:35,950
I've,

6121
02:40:35,950 --> 02:40:37,320
I've said the same thing about fate or,

6122
02:40:37,321 --> 02:40:40,440
and people got mad at me faint
or fought in a dirty league.

6123
02:40:40,710 --> 02:40:41,880
He fought in pride.

6124
02:40:41,881 --> 02:40:42,870
It was a dirty league.

6125
02:40:42,900 --> 02:40:43,890
I mean ensign anyway,

6126
02:40:43,891 --> 02:40:45,210
sat in a very safe seat.

6127
02:40:45,211 --> 02:40:49,170
You're sitting in and it was laughing
about his contract for pride where they

6128
02:40:49,171 --> 02:40:51,780
told him that we don't test for steroids.

6129
02:40:52,230 --> 02:40:54,240
Does that mean that that
fade or was not on it?

6130
02:40:54,270 --> 02:40:54,541
No,

6131
02:40:54,541 --> 02:40:55,141
it doesn't mean that.

6132
02:40:55,141 --> 02:40:57,330
But when you have a league
where everyone's on it,

6133
02:40:57,331 --> 02:40:59,250
like Vander lay was without a doubt.

6134
02:40:59,250 --> 02:41:01,170
And I said one of my favorite
fighters of all time.

6135
02:41:01,171 --> 02:41:02,400
It's not my number one favorite.

6136
02:41:02,401 --> 02:41:02,880
Yeah.

6137
02:41:02,880 --> 02:41:04,800
Like when I get excited to watch a fight,

6138
02:41:04,801 --> 02:41:05,880
when Vandelay was fighting,

6139
02:41:05,881 --> 02:41:07,890
it was probably the most
excited you you can get.

6140
02:41:08,490 --> 02:41:08,851
You know?

6141
02:41:08,851 --> 02:41:10,890
It's just like you knew it
was just going to be chaos,

6142
02:41:10,930 --> 02:41:11,830
just such a marker,

6143
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:12,350
you know,

6144
02:41:12,350 --> 02:41:13,620
he was terrifying,

6145
02:41:13,650 --> 02:41:15,960
but he was obviously
on some shit obviously.

6146
02:41:16,020 --> 02:41:17,040
And the vendor laid that,

6147
02:41:17,041 --> 02:41:19,020
showed up with the UFC
was not the same guy.

6148
02:41:19,021 --> 02:41:20,630
He just wasn't me.

6149
02:41:20,640 --> 02:41:22,290
Still had that warrior's heart.

6150
02:41:22,440 --> 02:41:24,780
But his body just did not
cooperate the same way.

6151
02:41:24,781 --> 02:41:28,350
And a lot of is probably because his
endocrine system is all fucked up from

6152
02:41:28,351 --> 02:41:29,550
years of using stuff.

6153
02:41:30,030 --> 02:41:30,863
So you know,

6154
02:41:30,910 --> 02:41:31,261
Waze,

6155
02:41:31,261 --> 02:41:31,960
I don't know.

6156
02:41:31,960 --> 02:41:32,610
Fuck,

6157
02:41:32,610 --> 02:41:33,330
I don't know.

6158
02:41:33,330 --> 02:41:33,780
You know,

6159
02:41:33,780 --> 02:41:33,900
it's,

6160
02:41:33,900 --> 02:41:34,800
I'm just guessing.

6161
02:41:34,950 --> 02:41:36,430
I'm just totally guessing.

6162
02:41:36,710 --> 02:41:40,590
The Vandelay one Vandelay ran away from
a drug test too and now a suspended

6163
02:41:40,591 --> 02:41:41,221
indefinitely,

6164
02:41:41,221 --> 02:41:42,780
which I think is kind of fucked up.

6165
02:41:43,230 --> 02:41:43,501
You know?

6166
02:41:43,501 --> 02:41:44,660
I think if they should have,

6167
02:41:44,700 --> 02:41:46,770
they should have the
worst they could give you.

6168
02:41:46,771 --> 02:41:48,130
At the time she tested positive.

6169
02:41:48,131 --> 02:41:48,964
It was like a year.

6170
02:41:49,230 --> 02:41:50,370
They should have given him a year.

6171
02:41:50,730 --> 02:41:51,331
They should have said,

6172
02:41:51,331 --> 02:41:51,930
look dude,

6173
02:41:51,930 --> 02:41:53,490
we know what the fuck is going on.

6174
02:41:53,491 --> 02:41:54,510
And then if that's the case,

6175
02:41:54,511 --> 02:41:55,890
he'd already be fighting again by now.

6176
02:41:55,920 --> 02:41:56,251
Yeah,

6177
02:41:56,251 --> 02:41:58,200
you could treat it just
like that's a concession.

6178
02:41:58,320 --> 02:41:59,430
I can see that I'm using,

6179
02:41:59,520 --> 02:42:00,070
if I run,

6180
02:42:00,070 --> 02:42:01,200
if I run a concede.

6181
02:42:01,440 --> 02:42:01,591
Yeah.

6182
02:42:01,591 --> 02:42:03,750
They wanted to make an example
out of him and they said,

6183
02:42:03,751 --> 02:42:03,961
you know,

6184
02:42:03,961 --> 02:42:05,310
we're going to give you a lifetime ban.

6185
02:42:05,311 --> 02:42:06,390
Well that's fucked up,

6186
02:42:06,391 --> 02:42:06,661
man,

6187
02:42:06,661 --> 02:42:07,530
because this guy,

6188
02:42:07,531 --> 02:42:08,720
this is his life is,

6189
02:42:08,721 --> 02:42:08,911
is,

6190
02:42:08,911 --> 02:42:09,750
is living.

6191
02:42:09,870 --> 02:42:13,080
You essentially took away his
living from one violation,

6192
02:42:13,081 --> 02:42:17,430
the only violation of his
entire professional career.

6193
02:42:18,030 --> 02:42:18,421
We know,

6194
02:42:18,421 --> 02:42:19,860
suspicions aside,

6195
02:42:19,890 --> 02:42:23,760
and there's certainly suspicions of
when he was competing in pride and even

6196
02:42:23,990 --> 02:42:26,430
possibly suspicions of when
he's competing in the UFC.

6197
02:42:26,820 --> 02:42:30,940
But the reality is the guy never got
caught except for the one time where he

6198
02:42:30,941 --> 02:42:31,511
evaded it,

6199
02:42:31,511 --> 02:42:32,160
test,

6200
02:42:32,160 --> 02:42:34,050
treat it like it's a positive test.

6201
02:42:34,530 --> 02:42:34,891
You know?

6202
02:42:34,891 --> 02:42:35,131
I mean,

6203
02:42:35,131 --> 02:42:38,190
I get the whole idea of
sending a fucking message,

6204
02:42:38,191 --> 02:42:40,230
but that message is long been set.

6205
02:42:40,290 --> 02:42:45,030
I mean everybody knows you if you test
positive and then you see the new testing

6206
02:42:45,120 --> 02:42:46,590
rules that they pulled out,

6207
02:42:47,130 --> 02:42:48,630
their new ones are brutal.

6208
02:42:48,660 --> 02:42:49,980
The new ones are three years,

6209
02:42:50,070 --> 02:42:50,940
three years.

6210
02:42:50,941 --> 02:42:52,110
Some of them are lifestyle.

6211
02:42:52,111 --> 02:42:53,250
It's lifetime.

6212
02:42:53,251 --> 02:42:54,270
If you have a second,

6213
02:42:54,300 --> 02:42:54,810
um,

6214
02:42:54,810 --> 02:42:55,021
uh,

6215
02:42:55,021 --> 02:42:58,860
if you try to run away
from a test a second time,

6216
02:42:58,861 --> 02:43:01,230
he tried to run away from a
test sell lifetime suspension,

6217
02:43:01,680 --> 02:43:03,230
but three years for a first offense,

6218
02:43:03,490 --> 02:43:04,750
I don't know if it was three years,

6219
02:43:04,770 --> 02:43:05,461
two years,

6220
02:43:05,461 --> 02:43:06,241
I think it's two years,

6221
02:43:06,241 --> 02:43:07,620
three years for a second offense,

6222
02:43:07,650 --> 02:43:08,280
something like that.

6223
02:43:08,280 --> 02:43:09,940
Almost a career under not only that,

6224
02:43:09,950 --> 02:43:13,360
they take 75% of your purse
up to 75% of your purse.

6225
02:43:13,390 --> 02:43:13,870
Yeah,

6226
02:43:13,870 --> 02:43:14,740
there's some big ones.

6227
02:43:14,770 --> 02:43:16,480
If you take three years
out of a guy's prime,

6228
02:43:17,080 --> 02:43:20,380
especially a guy in his late and
late thirties like an Anderson,

6229
02:43:20,780 --> 02:43:22,720
like Anderson Anderson's going through,

6230
02:43:23,020 --> 02:43:26,380
I don't know what they give him a year
and a half and he's fighting against it.

6231
02:43:26,530 --> 02:43:29,090
We'll talk in about 10 minutes and I'll
give you the whole rundown of what I

6232
02:43:29,091 --> 02:43:30,570
actually know because you'll,

6233
02:43:30,590 --> 02:43:31,060
you'll go,

6234
02:43:31,060 --> 02:43:32,020
oh,

6235
02:43:32,230 --> 02:43:33,063
I wish I could tell you.

6236
02:43:33,190 --> 02:43:33,611
Here it goes.

6237
02:43:33,611 --> 02:43:35,230
First offense for testosterone,

6238
02:43:35,231 --> 02:43:36,280
antibiotic steroids,

6239
02:43:36,281 --> 02:43:37,114
Hgh,

6240
02:43:37,240 --> 02:43:38,860
36 month suspension,

6241
02:43:38,861 --> 02:43:43,420
find a 50 to 75% second
offense for fucking years.

6242
02:43:43,960 --> 02:43:46,690
75 to 100% of fighters purse.

6243
02:43:46,720 --> 02:43:47,620
Third Offense,

6244
02:43:47,770 --> 02:43:49,120
lifetime suspension,

6245
02:43:49,121 --> 02:43:53,890
fine of 100% avoiding
first offense for years,

6246
02:43:53,980 --> 02:43:56,080
fine of 75% second offense,

6247
02:43:56,081 --> 02:43:57,220
lifetime suspension,

6248
02:43:57,221 --> 02:43:59,050
fine of 100% of fighters purse.

6249
02:43:59,710 --> 02:44:00,210
Well,

6250
02:44:00,210 --> 02:44:01,300
I wonder if that'll be enough.

6251
02:44:02,070 --> 02:44:04,390
I guess the idea is
we're going to hang you,

6252
02:44:05,140 --> 02:44:08,260
they're trying to set up a sort of almost
a zero tolerance policy in order to

6253
02:44:08,261 --> 02:44:09,400
scare guys street.

6254
02:44:09,430 --> 02:44:14,430
Well Bron Rhonda Rousey had a very good
point and this point is that if someone

6255
02:44:18,101 --> 02:44:23,101
uses some sort of antibiotic steroid
and they can hit their opponent more and

6256
02:44:24,401 --> 02:44:25,750
then that opponent dies.

6257
02:44:25,810 --> 02:44:26,643
Totally.

6258
02:44:26,920 --> 02:44:30,090
This is that is that
murder or manslaughter?

6259
02:44:30,660 --> 02:44:32,050
She's very good point.

6260
02:44:32,370 --> 02:44:33,850
And you guys are already super heroes.

6261
02:44:33,880 --> 02:44:34,230
Exactly.

6262
02:44:34,230 --> 02:44:35,960
Need juice them up and yeah,

6263
02:44:36,010 --> 02:44:36,491
that's dangerous.

6264
02:44:36,491 --> 02:44:36,940
You can,

6265
02:44:36,940 --> 02:44:37,271
you can.

6266
02:44:37,271 --> 02:44:37,991
Most certainly,

6267
02:44:37,991 --> 02:44:41,110
if you're on EPO and human
growth hormone and testosterone,

6268
02:44:41,111 --> 02:44:45,160
you can most certainly hit someone more
than you would be able to if you are not

6269
02:44:45,161 --> 02:44:45,994
on that.

6270
02:44:46,090 --> 02:44:50,170
Especially if like these cases where
guys are testing with like literally

6271
02:44:50,171 --> 02:44:51,730
superhuman levels,

6272
02:44:52,090 --> 02:44:53,740
like v tour when they,

6273
02:44:53,770 --> 02:44:58,770
when they eventually
rescinded the testosterone
replacement therapy thing from

6274
02:44:58,921 --> 02:44:59,351
Nevada,

6275
02:44:59,351 --> 02:45:00,280
when they tested him,

6276
02:45:00,610 --> 02:45:05,610
he was at 1,475 an average man in his
prime is like around 500 to like 800 for

6277
02:45:09,191 --> 02:45:10,270
some crazy stud.

6278
02:45:10,630 --> 02:45:13,480
So he was like essentially
like double a human being.

6279
02:45:13,540 --> 02:45:14,200
Wow.

6280
02:45:14,200 --> 02:45:15,310
The level of testosterone.

6281
02:45:15,311 --> 02:45:16,140
So it's crazy.

6282
02:45:16,140 --> 02:45:16,660
Yeah.

6283
02:45:16,660 --> 02:45:19,740
Nevada judge overturns
Vandelia Silva's lifetime ban.

6284
02:45:19,750 --> 02:45:20,171
Really?

6285
02:45:20,171 --> 02:45:21,790
This just happened today.

6286
02:45:22,090 --> 02:45:22,960
Holy Shit.

6287
02:45:22,961 --> 02:45:23,711
Breaking News,

6288
02:45:23,711 --> 02:45:24,550
Ladies and gentlemen.

6289
02:45:24,730 --> 02:45:28,220
Talk about fucking current
and talk about poignant Bob.

6290
02:45:28,230 --> 02:45:29,021
Pull that down.

6291
02:45:29,021 --> 02:45:29,920
Let's fucking scroll that.

6292
02:45:29,921 --> 02:45:30,550
Good for him.

6293
02:45:30,550 --> 02:45:30,881
Broke it.

6294
02:45:30,881 --> 02:45:35,380
Two 30 Vandelay Silva won a major victory
in court today with a Nevada district

6295
02:45:35,381 --> 02:45:37,300
judge throwing out the lifetime ban.

6296
02:45:37,360 --> 02:45:38,380
I will applaud.

6297
02:45:38,950 --> 02:45:43,950
I applaud that ESPN is Brett Okamoto
reported via Twitter that the judge did

6298
02:45:44,861 --> 02:45:48,370
agree that the Nevada state afflict the
plot of state athletic commission had

6299
02:45:48,371 --> 02:45:52,480
jurisdiction over silver despite being
an unlicensed athlete at the time,

6300
02:45:52,660 --> 02:45:56,470
but that there was not sufficient
evidence to support a lifetime ban.

6301
02:45:56,500 --> 02:45:57,333
I agree.

6302
02:45:57,880 --> 02:46:02,880
35 12 and one MMA five and seven in the
UFC was handed a hefty punishment after

6303
02:46:04,001 --> 02:46:05,300
he ran from random drug tests.

6304
02:46:05,301 --> 02:46:06,134
But pepper prepare.

6305
02:46:06,280 --> 02:46:07,090
So they,

6306
02:46:07,090 --> 02:46:10,100
this is so they overturn the the

6307
02:46:10,100 --> 02:46:10,970
lifetime ban,

6308
02:46:10,971 --> 02:46:12,710
but it doesn't mean that
he's been reinstated.

6309
02:46:13,010 --> 02:46:13,850
Not reinstated.

6310
02:46:14,030 --> 02:46:14,930
But what's good.

6311
02:46:14,950 --> 02:46:15,060
Oh,

6312
02:46:15,060 --> 02:46:16,700
is he still under contract with the UFC?

6313
02:46:16,701 --> 02:46:18,290
Like the USC wouldn't even let him.

6314
02:46:18,560 --> 02:46:22,040
He said he made a bunch of like
really critical videos about the UFC,

6315
02:46:23,360 --> 02:46:24,081
which again,

6316
02:46:24,081 --> 02:46:24,950
a lot of these guys,

6317
02:46:24,951 --> 02:46:25,191
man,

6318
02:46:25,191 --> 02:46:26,420
they need someone to talk to.

6319
02:46:26,720 --> 02:46:27,920
I would love to be the guy,

6320
02:46:28,040 --> 02:46:28,550
you know,

6321
02:46:28,550 --> 02:46:30,460
I'd love to be the guy that
talked to a lot of these guys.

6322
02:46:30,510 --> 02:46:30,831
Just go,

6323
02:46:30,831 --> 02:46:32,090
don't do that.

6324
02:46:32,780 --> 02:46:33,650
Don't do that.

6325
02:46:34,080 --> 02:46:36,830
He was a banned for life while
also he was talking about the UFC,

6326
02:46:36,831 --> 02:46:39,050
treating people like
slaves and then you know,

6327
02:46:39,051 --> 02:46:39,620
Dana was like,

6328
02:46:39,620 --> 02:46:40,070
um,

6329
02:46:40,070 --> 02:46:41,990
we gave you $9 million.

6330
02:46:42,100 --> 02:46:42,890
Wow.

6331
02:46:42,890 --> 02:46:44,330
That's how much he made in the USA.

6332
02:46:44,570 --> 02:46:45,300
Yes.

6333
02:46:45,300 --> 02:46:45,621
It's like,

6334
02:46:45,621 --> 02:46:46,340
come on son.

6335
02:46:46,340 --> 02:46:47,540
That's not slavery.

6336
02:46:47,570 --> 02:46:48,131
That's not slightly,

6337
02:46:48,131 --> 02:46:49,040
we fought for seven years.

6338
02:46:49,041 --> 02:46:50,540
You mean 9 million bucks
and it's good money.

6339
02:46:50,540 --> 02:46:51,141
It's good money,

6340
02:46:51,141 --> 02:46:51,411
man.

6341
02:46:51,411 --> 02:46:51,861
For every end.

6342
02:46:51,861 --> 02:46:52,970
You had seminars,

6343
02:46:52,971 --> 02:46:54,770
you ran a gym like you did well,

6344
02:46:54,771 --> 02:46:56,780
you're a fucking an Isa loved guy.

6345
02:46:57,210 --> 02:47:01,070
I just have a soft spot in my heart
for Vandelay like as a human being.

6346
02:47:01,071 --> 02:47:01,970
Like when I know him,

6347
02:47:02,090 --> 02:47:02,380
when I,

6348
02:47:02,380 --> 02:47:03,410
when I meet him and see him,

6349
02:47:03,830 --> 02:47:04,551
I always like to see him.

6350
02:47:04,551 --> 02:47:05,211
He's a very warm,

6351
02:47:05,211 --> 02:47:06,500
friendly guy and I just,

6352
02:47:06,770 --> 02:47:08,510
any guy who was willing
to fight like that guy,

6353
02:47:09,110 --> 02:47:11,180
that guy fucking a sweet
guy out of the cage.

6354
02:47:11,210 --> 02:47:11,571
That's really,

6355
02:47:11,571 --> 02:47:13,440
that's what's so fascinating
about people that I can,

6356
02:47:13,441 --> 02:47:13,671
I'm like,

6357
02:47:13,671 --> 02:47:14,050
I have,

6358
02:47:14,050 --> 02:47:17,090
I had some friends from my gym
who trained with Vandelay Jam.

6359
02:47:17,091 --> 02:47:17,900
They all love him.

6360
02:47:17,900 --> 02:47:18,021
Oh,

6361
02:47:18,021 --> 02:47:18,854
he's a sweet guy.

6362
02:47:18,880 --> 02:47:19,713
He's a nice guy.

6363
02:47:19,730 --> 02:47:22,280
But he spars like it's life or death.

6364
02:47:22,730 --> 02:47:24,200
Like there's videos of him sparring.

6365
02:47:24,230 --> 02:47:24,831
I've heard about this.

6366
02:47:24,831 --> 02:47:25,100
I'm like,

6367
02:47:25,100 --> 02:47:26,210
Jeez,

6368
02:47:26,450 --> 02:47:27,500
that was the real stone age.

6369
02:47:27,500 --> 02:47:28,520
Or was that shoe box?

6370
02:47:28,730 --> 02:47:29,061
Yeah,

6371
02:47:29,061 --> 02:47:30,520
shoot the box box.

6372
02:47:30,570 --> 02:47:30,980
Well,

6373
02:47:30,980 --> 02:47:31,700
who'd Jamar,

6374
02:47:31,700 --> 02:47:32,210
uh,

6375
02:47:32,210 --> 02:47:32,541
you know,

6376
02:47:32,541 --> 02:47:33,380
the guy who ran it,

6377
02:47:33,410 --> 02:47:34,580
he should have boxed mean.

6378
02:47:34,581 --> 02:47:35,600
Does it mean shoot inbox?

6379
02:47:35,720 --> 02:47:36,050
What does it,

6380
02:47:36,050 --> 02:47:36,791
what does that mean?

6381
02:47:36,791 --> 02:47:37,610
That's a good question.

6382
02:47:37,610 --> 02:47:40,820
I mean it's obviously a Portuguese
version probably of shoot box,

6383
02:47:41,150 --> 02:47:41,571
which is,

6384
02:47:41,571 --> 02:47:42,404
um,

6385
02:47:42,520 --> 02:47:42,860
um,

6386
02:47:42,860 --> 02:47:46,580
that's how John Danaher
describes MMA shoot boxing,

6387
02:47:46,700 --> 02:47:47,150
you know,

6388
02:47:47,150 --> 02:47:48,470
shoot box rules,

6389
02:47:48,471 --> 02:47:51,530
the rules of engagement and the
way you approach it and think it.

6390
02:47:52,070 --> 02:47:52,970
I think that what,

6391
02:47:53,000 --> 02:47:53,833
um,

6392
02:47:54,080 --> 02:47:58,550
what they did at shoot box was
established like the most aggressive,

6393
02:47:58,551 --> 02:48:00,950
most intimidating team ever.

6394
02:48:01,460 --> 02:48:02,000
You know,

6395
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:07,000
especially at that time they were
just all berserkers Vander lay show,

6396
02:48:07,371 --> 02:48:08,810
gun Ninja,

6397
02:48:08,870 --> 02:48:10,940
Anderson pay lay.

6398
02:48:11,180 --> 02:48:14,960
There was just one killer after
another in their primes in their prize.

6399
02:48:15,290 --> 02:48:16,041
And then you know,

6400
02:48:16,041 --> 02:48:21,041
Hofeld Codero guy who's gone from that
gym and now is training like for Breeshia

6401
02:48:21,260 --> 02:48:21,980
for doom,

6402
02:48:21,980 --> 02:48:26,180
radically increased his striking Hockfield
court Hatfield dos Anjos radically

6403
02:48:26,181 --> 02:48:27,200
increased his striking.

6404
02:48:27,200 --> 02:48:28,610
So yeah,

6405
02:48:28,611 --> 02:48:31,340
it's not just like that
attitude and that drive.

6406
02:48:31,341 --> 02:48:32,480
It's also skill.

6407
02:48:32,630 --> 02:48:35,920
Like those guys are very skillful
and they just also know about,

6408
02:48:35,930 --> 02:48:38,540
they just didn't know about
putting pressure on motherfuckers.

6409
02:48:38,930 --> 02:48:40,550
Like they'll sign Angeles versus pedis.

6410
02:48:40,580 --> 02:48:42,870
That was just aggression and pressure.

6411
02:48:42,880 --> 02:48:43,713
And,

6412
02:48:44,060 --> 02:48:44,840
but again,

6413
02:48:44,840 --> 02:48:45,531
after that fight,

6414
02:48:45,531 --> 02:48:48,890
I've got nick curse on the guy who trained
him and his strength and conditioning

6415
02:48:48,950 --> 02:48:49,700
a up,

6416
02:48:49,700 --> 02:48:53,520
I think he's here next week
or from her and and uh,

6417
02:48:53,630 --> 02:48:54,020
no,

6418
02:48:54,020 --> 02:48:54,501
I'm sorry.

6419
02:48:54,501 --> 02:48:55,430
He's here on Wednesday.

6420
02:48:55,820 --> 02:48:56,240
Um,

6421
02:48:56,240 --> 02:48:56,601
and I'm,

6422
02:48:56,601 --> 02:49:00,110
I'm really interested to talk
to him about it because his,

6423
02:49:00,500 --> 02:49:01,070
um,

6424
02:49:01,070 --> 02:49:06,070
his style of training fighters he learned
from the Marinovich has the same guy

6425
02:49:06,501 --> 02:49:11,160
that got Bj Penn in the best shape of
his life back when he fought like Diego

6426
02:49:11,160 --> 02:49:12,060
Sanchez that Bj,

6427
02:49:12,090 --> 02:49:14,430
I think one of the greatest
fighters of all time.

6428
02:49:14,431 --> 02:49:15,450
For sure Bj Penn.

6429
02:49:15,451 --> 02:49:17,400
But I think that Bj's the prime BJ.

6430
02:49:17,420 --> 02:49:18,080
Yeah.

6431
02:49:18,080 --> 02:49:18,320
You know,

6432
02:49:18,320 --> 02:49:19,011
so I'm,

6433
02:49:19,011 --> 02:49:22,410
I'm really curious to see what their
approach was to get a guy in the kind of

6434
02:49:22,411 --> 02:49:26,610
condition where he could fight five
retarded hard rounds like that.

6435
02:49:26,760 --> 02:49:28,680
So I don't know how it's possible.

6436
02:49:28,740 --> 02:49:30,450
I don't know how it's possible
in the amateur divisions.

6437
02:49:30,451 --> 02:49:33,060
We did two minute rounds
and if you were in a,

6438
02:49:33,260 --> 02:49:33,840
you know,

6439
02:49:33,840 --> 02:49:37,710
it really intense rounds we striking was
heavy and you're mixing the grappling

6440
02:49:37,711 --> 02:49:38,011
with it.

6441
02:49:38,011 --> 02:49:39,580
All the heavy exertion of grappling.

6442
02:49:40,560 --> 02:49:41,393
I was more,

6443
02:49:41,460 --> 02:49:42,750
you talked about having a heart attack,

6444
02:49:42,870 --> 02:49:43,770
doing hot yoga.

6445
02:49:43,800 --> 02:49:44,940
I felt that way all the time.

6446
02:49:44,941 --> 02:49:45,780
Like I'm going to die.

6447
02:49:46,260 --> 02:49:49,530
And I watch these guys on TV doing five
minute rounds after five minute rounds

6448
02:49:49,740 --> 02:49:52,770
and sometimes walking back to their
corners have this crazy round with their

6449
02:49:52,771 --> 02:49:54,000
mouths closed,

6450
02:49:54,390 --> 02:49:56,370
breathing calmly through their noses.

6451
02:49:56,910 --> 02:49:57,331
To me,

6452
02:49:57,331 --> 02:49:59,970
that's the most freakish
thing about these athletes.

6453
02:50:00,330 --> 02:50:02,010
Did you watch Neil Magni this weekend?

6454
02:50:02,610 --> 02:50:02,791
Well,

6455
02:50:02,791 --> 02:50:03,300
I know,

6456
02:50:03,300 --> 02:50:03,941
I actually,

6457
02:50:03,941 --> 02:50:05,370
I actually listened to
the fight companion.

6458
02:50:05,580 --> 02:50:06,301
Oh dude,

6459
02:50:06,301 --> 02:50:09,240
it was Neil magnes got
insane fucking cardio.

6460
02:50:09,270 --> 02:50:10,100
It's insane.

6461
02:50:10,100 --> 02:50:10,301
Well,

6462
02:50:10,301 --> 02:50:11,134
one of them do.

6463
02:50:11,300 --> 02:50:15,320
Benson Henderson Henderson
has these frenetic finds,

6464
02:50:15,330 --> 02:50:16,170
tons of grappling,

6465
02:50:16,171 --> 02:50:17,010
tons of striking.

6466
02:50:17,310 --> 02:50:18,330
He has never tired.

6467
02:50:18,360 --> 02:50:20,400
They don't know what it's like
to be tired of these work ethic.

6468
02:50:20,450 --> 02:50:24,390
Just insane work ethic and never getting
out of shape and never abusing your

6469
02:50:24,391 --> 02:50:26,940
body and always eating the right foods,

6470
02:50:26,970 --> 02:50:28,080
getting the right rest,

6471
02:50:28,260 --> 02:50:32,760
putting altitude tents up in your house
is Neil actually trains at altitude.

6472
02:50:32,761 --> 02:50:33,960
He trains as in Denver,

6473
02:50:33,990 --> 02:50:34,950
in altitude MMA.

6474
02:50:34,951 --> 02:50:36,570
Actually that's his gym in Denver.

6475
02:50:37,020 --> 02:50:37,441
But yeah,

6476
02:50:37,441 --> 02:50:37,891
that's,

6477
02:50:37,891 --> 02:50:39,570
there's an advantage in that for sure.

6478
02:50:39,750 --> 02:50:40,471
It's an advantage.

6479
02:50:40,471 --> 02:50:43,530
And a sleeping at altitude is the big one.

6480
02:50:43,650 --> 02:50:47,850
They actually say that you should like
go up to big bear to sleep and come down

6481
02:50:47,851 --> 02:50:50,040
to like c level to train.

6482
02:50:50,760 --> 02:50:51,450
That's what they say.

6483
02:50:51,450 --> 02:50:52,021
Oh yeah,

6484
02:50:52,021 --> 02:50:52,500
I see that.

6485
02:50:52,500 --> 02:50:55,350
Cause that way you could put
out more output glowed and yeah,

6486
02:50:55,380 --> 02:50:56,213
more work.

6487
02:50:56,610 --> 02:50:58,560
But you recover because of the,

6488
02:50:58,561 --> 02:50:58,710
uh,

6489
02:50:58,710 --> 02:50:59,730
sleeping and altitude.

6490
02:50:59,790 --> 02:51:00,623
Right.

6491
02:51:00,840 --> 02:51:01,410
Um,

6492
02:51:01,410 --> 02:51:02,430
we're almost out of time.

6493
02:51:02,431 --> 02:51:04,110
But what did you,

6494
02:51:04,111 --> 02:51:04,830
what's the,

6495
02:51:04,830 --> 02:51:08,010
what's the biggest thing that you
got out of this whole experiment?

6496
02:51:08,220 --> 02:51:09,150
Other than a great book,

6497
02:51:09,660 --> 02:51:12,510
which I've heard nothing but
fantastic things about this book.

6498
02:51:12,511 --> 02:51:12,811
By the way.

6499
02:51:12,811 --> 02:51:14,280
It's one of the reasons why
I wanted to get you in here.

6500
02:51:14,580 --> 02:51:17,220
I've heard that you are
incredibly honest in this,

6501
02:51:17,221 --> 02:51:20,910
about your fears and though the
experience and very eloquent.

6502
02:51:20,911 --> 02:51:23,490
So the professor in the
cage go get this book.

6503
02:51:23,491 --> 02:51:24,324
You fucks.

6504
02:51:24,530 --> 02:51:25,363
That's great.

6505
02:51:25,500 --> 02:51:26,100
Um,

6506
02:51:26,100 --> 02:51:26,933
I can't wait to read it.

6507
02:51:26,950 --> 02:51:27,690
Well thanks.

6508
02:51:27,690 --> 02:51:29,190
I don't even read hardcover books anymore.

6509
02:51:29,220 --> 02:51:29,371
Well,

6510
02:51:29,371 --> 02:51:29,851
like I said,

6511
02:51:29,851 --> 02:51:30,130
you know,

6512
02:51:30,130 --> 02:51:30,690
I,

6513
02:51:30,690 --> 02:51:31,680
when I was writing it,

6514
02:51:31,710 --> 02:51:33,120
I was thinking to myself,

6515
02:51:33,570 --> 02:51:34,050
uh,

6516
02:51:34,050 --> 02:51:34,681
sometimes like,

6517
02:51:34,681 --> 02:51:35,100
you know,

6518
02:51:35,100 --> 02:51:36,420
Joe Rogan doesn't like this book.

6519
02:51:37,560 --> 02:51:40,110
It means because it means I totally
whiffed I'm going to kindle it too.

6520
02:51:40,490 --> 02:51:41,323
I don't read.

6521
02:51:41,770 --> 02:51:43,430
Kindles are so much better to manage.

6522
02:51:43,480 --> 02:51:43,700
Well,

6523
02:51:43,700 --> 02:51:44,461
the little thing,

6524
02:51:44,461 --> 02:51:45,690
and I liked the paper

6525
02:51:47,690 --> 02:51:48,690
making your own it.

6526
02:51:49,480 --> 02:51:50,313
Um,

6527
02:51:50,610 --> 02:51:51,120
what did you,

6528
02:51:51,120 --> 02:51:54,350
what is the big thing that you got
out of this personally or sort of an

6529
02:51:54,351 --> 02:51:55,340
intellectual above?

6530
02:51:55,570 --> 02:51:55,990
Uh,

6531
02:51:55,990 --> 02:51:57,360
I mean intellectually is personally,

6532
02:51:57,361 --> 02:51:57,990
right?

6533
02:51:57,990 --> 02:51:58,823
Personally,

6534
02:51:59,190 --> 02:51:59,551
you know,

6535
02:51:59,551 --> 02:52:00,240
there was,

6536
02:52:00,240 --> 02:52:03,720
I had been through a
sort of lifetime of a,

6537
02:52:03,960 --> 02:52:04,441
I don't know,

6538
02:52:04,441 --> 02:52:06,250
like I was a late bloomer.

6539
02:52:06,251 --> 02:52:07,084
I was a kid,

6540
02:52:07,330 --> 02:52:07,870
um,

6541
02:52:07,870 --> 02:52:08,770
real small,

6542
02:52:08,810 --> 02:52:10,240
always sort of the runt of my,

6543
02:52:10,241 --> 02:52:10,780
uh,

6544
02:52:10,780 --> 02:52:13,230
in school came to me in my ailments,

6545
02:52:13,231 --> 02:52:14,560
sort of an average size guy now,

6546
02:52:14,561 --> 02:52:16,000
but I came to my growth really late.

6547
02:52:16,360 --> 02:52:18,040
And so I sort of have a basic,

6548
02:52:18,041 --> 02:52:18,640
you know,

6549
02:52:18,640 --> 02:52:21,530
school boy's story about getting
pushed around and bullied and,

6550
02:52:21,900 --> 02:52:22,540
and it's,

6551
02:52:22,540 --> 02:52:24,370
and there's no heroism in that story.

6552
02:52:24,640 --> 02:52:25,151
Uh,

6553
02:52:25,151 --> 02:52:26,070
and I always backed down.

6554
02:52:26,071 --> 02:52:27,040
I always ran for it.

6555
02:52:27,041 --> 02:52:28,620
I always found some way out of it.

6556
02:52:28,650 --> 02:52:31,120
It wasn't because I was a pacifist,

6557
02:52:31,630 --> 02:52:34,810
it wasn't like it had some noble high
minded reasons for avoiding the violence.

6558
02:52:34,960 --> 02:52:37,360
It was that I was scared and I
knew I was gonna get my ass kicked.

6559
02:52:37,630 --> 02:52:39,970
But I've always kind of felt like
that's no excuse for not for fighting.

6560
02:52:40,530 --> 02:52:41,200
You know,

6561
02:52:41,200 --> 02:52:42,033
that there's a,

6562
02:52:42,570 --> 02:52:43,690
you should stand up to the bullet.

6563
02:52:43,880 --> 02:52:44,120
Um,

6564
02:52:44,120 --> 02:52:46,040
I've always felt that way and
even though I never did it so,

6565
02:52:46,690 --> 02:52:47,110
so,

6566
02:52:47,110 --> 02:52:50,710
so part of what I wanted to
do was I wanted to go into
that cage and I wanted to

6567
02:52:50,711 --> 02:52:55,210
sort of stand up to guys who were stronger
than me and more skilled than me and

6568
02:52:55,211 --> 02:52:58,390
sort of taking those beatings that I felt
like I should have taken 20 years ago.

6569
02:52:58,450 --> 02:52:59,283
You know what I mean?

6570
02:52:59,410 --> 02:52:59,840
Um,

6571
02:52:59,840 --> 02:53:01,360
and so as deep well,

6572
02:53:01,361 --> 02:53:01,761
yeah.

6573
02:53:01,761 --> 02:53:02,230
You know,

6574
02:53:02,230 --> 02:53:02,950
this is,

6575
02:53:02,950 --> 02:53:04,720
I don't know if you've ever
had experiences like that as a,

6576
02:53:04,721 --> 02:53:05,554
as a boy.

6577
02:53:05,860 --> 02:53:06,620
Um,

6578
02:53:06,620 --> 02:53:07,453
where are you,

6579
02:53:07,600 --> 02:53:10,870
where you behaved in a fashion
that you define as cowardly?

6580
02:53:10,900 --> 02:53:11,201
Yes,

6581
02:53:11,201 --> 02:53:11,830
definitely.

6582
02:53:11,830 --> 02:53:13,300
And it's amazing to me.

6583
02:53:13,301 --> 02:53:14,650
I'm 42 years old now.

6584
02:53:14,860 --> 02:53:15,580
Um,

6585
02:53:15,580 --> 02:53:17,170
I've had a lot of
accomplishments in my life.

6586
02:53:17,171 --> 02:53:18,160
I have a beautiful wife,

6587
02:53:18,161 --> 02:53:20,140
I have little children who are wonderful.

6588
02:53:20,430 --> 02:53:20,860
Um,

6589
02:53:20,860 --> 02:53:25,860
it's amazing to me how much psychological
weight that still carries from me that

6590
02:53:25,871 --> 02:53:27,400
I could still make myself blush,

6591
02:53:27,670 --> 02:53:28,060
uh,

6592
02:53:28,060 --> 02:53:29,260
thinking back to those moments.

6593
02:53:29,261 --> 02:53:31,570
And so part of it was a redemption
story from me about whether I could,

6594
02:53:31,870 --> 02:53:35,230
whether I could do
something to redeem myself,

6595
02:53:35,320 --> 02:53:39,550
at least in my own eyes for those
times when I'd flinched a as a kid.

6596
02:53:39,610 --> 02:53:40,271
That's awesome.

6597
02:53:40,271 --> 02:53:40,960
I love that.

6598
02:53:40,960 --> 02:53:42,010
I love that you did that.

6599
02:53:42,340 --> 02:53:43,840
I don't love that you
still blushing over it.

6600
02:53:44,080 --> 02:53:45,040
It's silly.

6601
02:53:45,090 --> 02:53:45,820
So stupid.

6602
02:53:45,820 --> 02:53:46,570
It's so crazy.

6603
02:53:46,570 --> 02:53:48,100
But it just means you've got work to do.

6604
02:53:48,220 --> 02:53:48,961
That's all it is.

6605
02:53:48,961 --> 02:53:49,200
You know,

6606
02:53:49,200 --> 02:53:51,610
just kind of worked before you
realize you're not that guy anymore.

6607
02:53:52,030 --> 02:53:52,271
Right.

6608
02:53:52,271 --> 02:53:53,020
You know?

6609
02:53:53,020 --> 02:53:53,500
Right.

6610
02:53:53,500 --> 02:53:56,500
I sort of became what I was terrified of.

6611
02:53:56,620 --> 02:53:58,030
That's to avoid,

6612
02:53:58,300 --> 02:53:58,630
you know,

6613
02:53:58,630 --> 02:53:59,620
being bullied.

6614
02:53:59,770 --> 02:54:00,950
I just became someone who was,

6615
02:54:00,970 --> 02:54:03,190
I never got in fights like high school on.

6616
02:54:03,191 --> 02:54:04,024
I never got in fights,

6617
02:54:04,360 --> 02:54:09,360
but I didn't get in fights by becoming
far stronger than I ever was before.

6618
02:54:10,030 --> 02:54:13,090
But I still would think back to like
guys that I was scared of when I was in

6619
02:54:13,091 --> 02:54:13,490
high school.

6620
02:54:13,490 --> 02:54:13,661
Like,

6621
02:54:13,661 --> 02:54:14,020
whoa.

6622
02:54:14,020 --> 02:54:14,531
But it never,

6623
02:54:14,531 --> 02:54:17,290
I never feel like I want to go back
now and look and kicked her ass.

6624
02:54:17,291 --> 02:54:20,050
Like that was surprising to me
that I never wanted to do that.

6625
02:54:20,080 --> 02:54:20,630
Yeah.

6626
02:54:20,630 --> 02:54:22,000
And I never wanted to go back.

6627
02:54:22,030 --> 02:54:22,330
Like,

6628
02:54:22,330 --> 02:54:22,930
hey dude,

6629
02:54:22,930 --> 02:54:24,190
you remember when you fucked with me.

6630
02:54:24,370 --> 02:54:25,170
I never,

6631
02:54:25,170 --> 02:54:26,290
I never wanted to do that.

6632
02:54:26,560 --> 02:54:27,070
I always,

6633
02:54:27,070 --> 02:54:27,371
I was,

6634
02:54:27,371 --> 02:54:30,160
but I also never carried
that burden around.

6635
02:54:30,470 --> 02:54:31,110
Yeah.

6636
02:54:31,110 --> 02:54:31,420
Yeah.

6637
02:54:31,420 --> 02:54:32,231
One time when I was,

6638
02:54:32,231 --> 02:54:33,010
um,

6639
02:54:33,010 --> 02:54:37,270
I think it was about like 19 or 20 when
I was already a black belt and I was

6640
02:54:37,540 --> 02:54:42,540
working out at my gym where I used to
teach and in Boston and I was just doing

6641
02:54:43,181 --> 02:54:44,440
these heavy rounds on the bag,

6642
02:54:44,441 --> 02:54:45,430
preparing for this tournament.

6643
02:54:45,830 --> 02:54:50,170
I had looked up and this guy was watching
that used to bully me in junior high

6644
02:54:50,171 --> 02:54:50,940
school,

6645
02:54:50,940 --> 02:54:51,420
this guy,

6646
02:54:51,420 --> 02:54:52,510
any from my high school from June,

6647
02:54:52,511 --> 02:54:55,690
I'm just like really rough junior
high school in Jamaica plain,

6648
02:54:55,691 --> 02:54:56,280
which is,

6649
02:54:56,280 --> 02:54:57,430
it's kind of gentrified now,

6650
02:54:57,431 --> 02:55:00,880
but at the time was like a really sketchy
area of Massachusetts and I looked up

6651
02:55:00,910 --> 02:55:02,260
and I felt bad for the guy.

6652
02:55:02,290 --> 02:55:03,490
It was really like,

6653
02:55:03,500 --> 02:55:04,610
instead of being angry at him,

6654
02:55:04,611 --> 02:55:05,570
I felt bad for him.

6655
02:55:05,770 --> 02:55:06,020
No,

6656
02:55:06,020 --> 02:55:06,411
that's right.

6657
02:55:06,411 --> 02:55:07,244
I mean,

6658
02:55:08,150 --> 02:55:10,610
all those guys from high
school were just kids too.

6659
02:55:11,090 --> 02:55:11,271
You know,

6660
02:55:11,271 --> 02:55:12,051
they were fuck ups too.

6661
02:55:12,051 --> 02:55:13,130
They had their own insecurities.

6662
02:55:13,131 --> 02:55:14,090
They had their own problems.

6663
02:55:14,630 --> 02:55:14,931
People,

6664
02:55:14,931 --> 02:55:16,250
it's stupid to be hung up on it.

6665
02:55:16,530 --> 02:55:17,240
Um,

6666
02:55:17,240 --> 02:55:18,380
and I'm not very hung up on it.

6667
02:55:18,381 --> 02:55:20,660
I don't have any fantasies of going
back and beating those guys up.

6668
02:55:20,780 --> 02:55:23,000
But I do hope they'll read
the book and they'll think,

6669
02:55:23,360 --> 02:55:23,571
boy,

6670
02:55:23,571 --> 02:55:24,470
he was a character for the boy,

6671
02:55:24,471 --> 02:55:24,711
but he,

6672
02:55:24,711 --> 02:55:27,590
but he grew into a brave
man professor in the cage.

6673
02:55:27,620 --> 02:55:28,880
You could buy it right now.

6674
02:55:28,881 --> 02:55:29,990
And it's available on Amazon.

6675
02:55:29,991 --> 02:55:30,141
Right?

6676
02:55:30,141 --> 02:55:30,974
I can get a candle.

6677
02:55:31,470 --> 02:55:31,880
Oh yeah.

6678
02:55:31,880 --> 02:55:32,360
All right.

6679
02:55:32,360 --> 02:55:32,960
Beautiful.

6680
02:55:32,960 --> 02:55:33,561
Thank you John.

6681
02:55:33,561 --> 02:55:34,400
Really appreciate it.

6682
02:55:34,440 --> 02:55:34,981
I appreciate it.

6683
02:55:34,981 --> 02:55:35,541
Let's just come on.

6684
02:55:35,541 --> 02:55:36,201
I appreciate it,

6685
02:55:36,201 --> 02:55:36,540
man.

6686
02:55:36,540 --> 02:55:36,950
Go,

6687
02:55:36,950 --> 02:55:37,520
go buy it.

6688
02:55:37,520 --> 02:55:38,001
Go read it.

6689
02:55:38,001 --> 02:55:38,834
Ladies and gentlemen,

6690
02:55:39,350 --> 02:55:40,280
the professor in the cage.

6691
02:55:40,281 --> 02:55:40,910
I'll be reading it.

6692
02:55:40,910 --> 02:55:42,560
I'll be talking about
it on a future podcast,

6693
02:55:42,561 --> 02:55:43,394
I'm sure.

6694
02:55:43,490 --> 02:55:43,731
Thank you,

6695
02:55:43,731 --> 02:55:43,941
sir.

6696
02:55:43,941 --> 02:55:44,431
Appreciate it.

6697
02:55:44,431 --> 02:55:45,264
Extra.

6698
02:55:55,120 --> 02:55:55,170
Yeah.
