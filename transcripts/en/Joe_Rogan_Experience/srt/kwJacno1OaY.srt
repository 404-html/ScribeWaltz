00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:05,900
The joe rogan experience
podcast my night day.

2
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,970
It's uh,
it gets real tricky when someone does

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,790
denies the rights of citizens than
someone who's empowered.

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,710
Denies the rights because w what are you
then,

5
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,810
if you're in power and you're denying
the rights,

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,660
as soon as you step in and deny people
do processed,

7
00:00:25,661 --> 00:00:29,280
deny people lawyers to die people,
why would you ever want to do that?

8
00:00:29,281 --> 00:00:32,280
It's a real question.
So when things get passed,

9
00:00:32,281 --> 00:00:36,930
like the National Defense Authorization
Act allows the government to

10
00:00:36,931 --> 00:00:40,440
indefinitely detained American civilians
and they don't have to do anything.

11
00:00:40,441 --> 00:00:42,210
They're not required to notify your
family.

12
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,660
They're not required to arrest you.
They're not required to.

13
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:46,910
You don't,
you can't,

14
00:00:46,911 --> 00:00:50,310
you don't have to get a lawyer.
They can just lock you up when you see

15
00:00:50,311 --> 00:00:51,690
shit like that.
Does that drive you crazy?

16
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:53,260
Oh yeah.
And people always say to me,

17
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:54,094
they say,
well,

18
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:56,060
you know,
why are you defending the terrorist?

19
00:00:56,061 --> 00:00:59,170
And what you try to explain to people is
without the due process,

20
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:01,360
there's no confirmation that this is a
terrorist.

21
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:06,130
The only way you know it's a terrorist
is when some court somewhere determines

22
00:01:06,131 --> 00:01:08,890
upon looking at the evidence that this
person is a terrorist.

23
00:01:08,891 --> 00:01:11,830
Once you can kill somebody on the
suspicion of being a terrorist,

24
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,720
well,
we're all under suspicion of terrorist

25
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:17,410
under the certain conditions that
someone wants to deem a mistaken

26
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:19,150
identity situation.
You know?

27
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,870
Or I mean how many,
how many guys are named Omar or Mohammad

28
00:01:22,871 --> 00:01:24,010
or you know what I mean?

29
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:26,010
Well,
how about in this dorm or case the,

30
00:01:26,011 --> 00:01:28,510
the cop shot up two different cars that
were the wrong cards.

31
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:30,000
Perfect example.
Perfect example.

32
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,300
You the,
the idea that the government should have

33
00:01:35,301 --> 00:01:38,030
special powers that regular human beings
don't.

34
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,110
That's crazy.

35
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:40,210
Well,
they have that now.

36
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:41,660
I mean,
I think they already do because

37
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:44,370
sure.
Take it to the next level and decide

38
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:47,400
that you're going to deny the rights of
people that you feel are guilty.

39
00:01:47,401 --> 00:01:49,680
Well,
who are you and how do I know that

40
00:01:49,681 --> 00:01:52,560
you're infallible and how do I know that
this isn't corruption?

41
00:01:52,561 --> 00:01:54,720
How do I know this isn't a personal
grudge?

42
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:59,520
It's not like you're dealing with an
organization that has a spotless record

43
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,800
over the past,
you know,

44
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:04,920
200 years where they're the most ethical
human beings to ever exist.

45
00:02:04,921 --> 00:02:06,920
And people from other countries come to
them for,

46
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,160
no,
we've caught them a lie,

47
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:08,940
but $1 million.

48
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:09,501
Oh,
you had could.

49
00:02:09,501 --> 00:02:12,330
We had a committee hearings,
which you cannot even imagine today,

50
00:02:12,331 --> 00:02:13,800
which shows you how much things have
changed.

51
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:16,980
In the 1970s we had the church committee
hearings in the Pike Committee hearings

52
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:21,780
where the government actually on
television exposed everything the CIA

53
00:02:21,781 --> 00:02:23,760
had been doing since the end of the
Second World War.

54
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:25,950
The assassinations and all this kind of
stuff.

55
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:30,060
The crown jewels are what the CIA used
to call those secrets that were exposed

56
00:02:30,061 --> 00:02:33,510
on television by congressional and
senatorial committees.

57
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:38,250
It just shows you what happens when
there's no oversight and if stuff is too

58
00:02:38,251 --> 00:02:41,580
secret to have oversight over,
you're asking for trouble.

59
00:02:41,581 --> 00:02:46,200
There's too many ways human beings can
justify going beyond the rules,

60
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:48,510
and there's always a good reason and you
hear it today.

61
00:02:48,511 --> 00:02:49,980
I mean,
the waterboarding thing.

62
00:02:49,981 --> 00:02:54,390
As a perfect example,
we prosecuted people at Nuremberg for

63
00:02:54,391 --> 00:02:56,760
having an attitude that we have now,
which is,

64
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,070
hey,
if they're terrorists and you can save

65
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,530
lives by torturing people.
Isn't that an ethical dilemma where it's

66
00:03:02,531 --> 00:03:03,910
worth torturing some guy,
you know,

67
00:03:03,911 --> 00:03:06,790
is bad anyway in order to save lives.
I mean,

68
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:09,610
if you could have prevented the two
towers from falling down by

69
00:03:09,611 --> 00:03:11,410
waterboarding,
a couple of bad guys,

70
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,860
isn't that worth it?
And that those ethical dilemmas lead you

71
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,620
off into the weeds really quickly.
And history shows that over and over

72
00:03:17,621 --> 00:03:18,430
again.

73
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:22,010
It's,
it's very doubtful that it's helping

74
00:03:22,011 --> 00:03:24,080
either.
It's very doubtful that you're really

75
00:03:24,081 --> 00:03:27,320
getting that kind of key information
from people by throwing water down their

76
00:03:27,321 --> 00:03:28,410
mouth.
You know,

77
00:03:28,411 --> 00:03:29,100
I don't,
I just,

78
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,060
I don't,
I don't know if if torturing people gets

79
00:03:32,061 --> 00:03:32,810
them to tell the truth,

80
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:35,870
gets him to tell you anything you want.
There's an old line about,

81
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,910
would you,
and I wish I could quote it at length.

82
00:03:37,911 --> 00:03:40,400
It's a wonderful line going back
hundreds of years where somebody says,

83
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:44,060
would you abrogate the laws in order to
get the devil?

84
00:03:44,061 --> 00:03:45,320
And the other guy says,
no,

85
00:03:45,321 --> 00:03:47,450
I would,
I would stick to the laws because if,

86
00:03:47,451 --> 00:03:49,400
if you abrogate the laws to get to the
devil,

87
00:03:49,401 --> 00:03:53,090
you take away the only thing that
protects yourself eventually.

88
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,680
And that's what this is.
People say,

89
00:03:54,681 --> 00:03:56,150
well,
it's okay to go after this to get to

90
00:03:56,151 --> 00:03:58,550
terrorists.
What makes you think one that it'll stay

91
00:03:58,551 --> 00:04:01,520
with terrorists and to that what a
terrorist is,

92
00:04:01,521 --> 00:04:04,670
that definition won't change.
The Bush administration was calling

93
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,650
these people that would light,
you know,

94
00:04:06,651 --> 00:04:09,550
car dealerships on fire in the middle of
the night when there was no one there.

95
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:12,110
Ecoterrorists you're going to drone
those people,

96
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:12,560
right?

97
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,340
When are you going to do exactly where
does the line get drawn and who gets to

98
00:04:15,341 --> 00:04:15,730
the

99
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:19,100
antifungal coffee proponents that might
get a little hyped up,

100
00:04:19,101 --> 00:04:21,310
but those motherfuckers grown those
people.

101
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:25,260
I mean do this whole fucking pope thing.
To me it's crazy,

102
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,680
crazy and hilarious that we even pay
attention to what that clown is doing.

103
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,980
How is that even making the news?
There's some weird fucking group of

104
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:36,240
people who do like the most bizarre
ceremonies who I,

105
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,010
I don't sanctioned sanctioned

106
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,600
governments and mass media.
No one calls it a call.

107
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,350
The guy's wearing a fucking wizard out
yet with a fish head hat.

108
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,560
It's if you tried to do that today and
tried to say,

109
00:04:48,561 --> 00:04:51,200
I am a Dorn of God.
He has brought to me this information.

110
00:04:51,201 --> 00:04:52,430
He tried,
you set up a shop,

111
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,760
they would think you are a fucking loon.
But because of the fact that it's been

112
00:04:55,761 --> 00:04:58,280
around for a long time,
this guy has a direct lineage.

113
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,510
We're supposed to take it serious.

114
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,040
We're supposed to take it seriously and
we're supposed to fucking ignore all the

115
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:04,660
Shit Catholicism did.
Well,

116
00:05:04,661 --> 00:05:05,570
how about this shit here

117
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,600
did he released a priest that had
molested 200 deaf boys,

118
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,940
200 he let them go,
Huh?

119
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,270
He let them go,
brought him into psychiatric instead of

120
00:05:17,271 --> 00:05:20,270
bringing in and getting them prosecuted.
They brought him in for psychiatric

121
00:05:20,271 --> 00:05:23,840
treatment and this guy went on to,
they went to another parish and molested

122
00:05:23,841 --> 00:05:25,100
more voice.
I mean,

123
00:05:25,101 --> 00:05:27,680
it's fucking craziness.
He did that time and time again.

124
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:31,430
He took people away from being
prosecuted and sent him to psychiatric

125
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:33,860
care and and they're free.
They're free to go.

126
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,830
They're free.
They're walking around the streets.

127
00:05:35,831 --> 00:05:40,310
Some of them are in these huge religious
retreat places that they have beautiful

128
00:05:40,311 --> 00:05:42,830
grounds and these guys are just
wandering around taking care of for the

129
00:05:42,831 --> 00:05:44,020
rest of their lives and the trauma.

130
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:46,000
There's a place like that up by where I
live.

131
00:05:46,001 --> 00:05:46,451
Where?
Yeah,

132
00:05:46,451 --> 00:05:47,284
there that.
Yeah.

133
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:50,470
So right.
So that's happening and they don't pay

134
00:05:50,471 --> 00:05:52,360
taxes.
They don't pay fucking taxes.

135
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,070
That is is

136
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:55,590
fucking crazy.
All that shit is crazy.

137
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:00,110
The idea that they should be able to
make golden buildings and not pay taxes.

138
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,000
Bitch,
are you out of your fucking mind?

139
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,550
Can you fucking imagine that's a
business.

140
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:07,100
It's a business.
It's a fucking business.

141
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:08,481
You're not.
No.

142
00:06:08,481 --> 00:06:10,700
You don't talk directly directly for
God.

143
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:14,330
It's 2013 stop.
Stop your bullshit.

144
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,030
You're not telling the truth.
You don't know that much.

145
00:06:17,031 --> 00:06:20,810
I don't believe you.
I think you are very charismatic and

146
00:06:20,811 --> 00:06:23,570
there's a lot of people that want to
believe you and they'll go along with

147
00:06:23,571 --> 00:06:26,150
it.
But you're talking crazy to God's not

148
00:06:26,151 --> 00:06:27,620
talking to you stupid.
No,

149
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:29,360
you're an asshole.
You're an asshole and you,

150
00:06:29,361 --> 00:06:33,290
you'd taken their money.
And we've got to make sure that this

151
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:36,230
stops with our generation.
We've got to make sure that future

152
00:06:36,231 --> 00:06:40,610
generations don't,
they don't have a gigantic religious

153
00:06:40,611 --> 00:06:43,190
leader.
Someone who tells them based on some

154
00:06:43,191 --> 00:06:47,120
nutty shit that was written thousands of
years ago by people drew on animal

155
00:06:47,121 --> 00:06:47,520
skins.
Yeah.

156
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,320
So it also,
it spreads that the way that looks with

157
00:06:50,321 --> 00:06:52,810
Catholicism is just one version of the
problem.

158
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:55,720
The other problem is the guy who calls,
you know,

159
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:57,340
there's like an,
in the way there was a pope,

160
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,380
there's also a dude who calls himself
the president,

161
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:03,910
but instead of representing some
phantasmo forest called God,

162
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,300
he says,
I represent the will of the people.

163
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,540
Yet he doesn't really represent the well
of the people.

164
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:13,060
It doesn't seem like that when he goes
to when,

165
00:07:13,061 --> 00:07:15,580
when,
when they do the polls and that fine as

166
00:07:15,581 --> 00:07:16,660
it turns out,
you know,

167
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,670
and I'm not just the present,
of course the government as a whole,

168
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,070
the president doesn't have to tell
Alterian power,

169
00:07:21,071 --> 00:07:24,070
but I don't think that the president
really represents the will of the

170
00:07:24,071 --> 00:07:25,960
people.
And I don't think Congress represents

171
00:07:25,961 --> 00:07:28,570
the will of the people.
And I don't think Senate represents the

172
00:07:28,571 --> 00:07:31,810
will of the people any more than the
pope represents the will of God.

173
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:35,590
And I think it's this,
this imaginary thing that we're supposed

174
00:07:35,591 --> 00:07:37,860
to believe in because it makes us feel
more comfortable as those,

175
00:07:37,861 --> 00:07:40,660
these people are really enacting the
will of the people.

176
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:43,990
I think the will of the people is a,
that we want peace.

177
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,710
We want to be able to,
like we,

178
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:48,190
we do want security,
we want education,

179
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:52,230
but we don't want fucking war with Iran.
Yeah,

180
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:55,530
we don't want fucking war with Iraq,
Iraq,

181
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:57,130
Iraq.
How the fuck do you say?

182
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,860
And I forget to say that I got,
so start up,

183
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:02,410
we don't want it.
Nobody wants war.

184
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,540
And if there is,
it's a small faction of people,

185
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:06,470
sweaty red face.
Cocksuckers

186
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:08,910
did you guys,
I was going to bring this up yesterday.

187
00:08:08,911 --> 00:08:13,710
Did you guys hear about this guy who got
arrested with a hundred bags of heroin

188
00:08:13,711 --> 00:08:16,350
up his ass?
No hundred bags.

189
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,170
Hundred bags.
It was a traffic stop.

190
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,010
This his ass hauled him is brutal.

191
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:23,940
Ah,
you have a sinkhole

192
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:26,720
sir?
It's a hundred bags of heroin,

193
00:08:26,721 --> 00:08:28,850
man.
That's the man.

194
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,470
Oh,
oh Jesus.

195
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,230
Okay.
I,

196
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:35,990
I look,
I look this killa season.

197
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:36,740
No,
no,

198
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:37,551
this one.
Okay.

199
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:39,080
This guy just had one.
Okay,

200
00:08:39,081 --> 00:08:40,730
let's get the other guy had it.
His ass.

201
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,760
One guy just had 200 bags.
I'm like,

202
00:08:43,761 --> 00:08:45,380
did someone just take it to the next
level?

203
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:49,400
You gotta you gotta Watch Killa season.
So this dude gets busted on the

204
00:08:49,401 --> 00:08:54,200
palisades parkway.
They pull him over and his 2005

205
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:57,630
Mitsubishi Lancer and he's acting real
weird.

206
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,750
And um,
so they decided to bring him in.

207
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,040
So they bring him in and they opened up
his ass.

208
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,220
They just gave him a cavity check.
I mean the guy didn't do anything wrong

209
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:10,530
and they pulled him over.
He just looked weird.

210
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,620
He was tweaking out on his own.
Something was going on with the man.

211
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,460
He was pulled over.

212
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,410
I mean,
routine traffic stop.

213
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:20,100
But they,
they detected the smell of marijuana and

214
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,800
that's where they,
uh,

215
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,930
that's where they got them and they
brought him in because they smelled

216
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:26,070
marijuana.
That's it.

217
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,040
And he had a hundred bags of heroin up
his ass.

218
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:32,790
And you can't put a hundred bags of
heroin up your ass while the cops are

219
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:35,250
going from their car to your car.
You can't do that.

220
00:09:35,251 --> 00:09:37,980
So he was driving around with those
packed up.

221
00:09:37,981 --> 00:09:40,110
Is that,
why would you drive around and smoke

222
00:09:40,111 --> 00:09:42,180
weed with a hundred packs of heroin in
your ass?

223
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,670
Well,
I think he's just one of those guys.

224
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,073
That's his move.

225
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,333
Maybe it's like,

226
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:52,290
like Russian chicks would put ben Wa
balls and their pussy to tighten up

227
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,580
their must.
They're fuck muscle.

228
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:56,280
Maybe this dude was just like exercise
and his,

229
00:09:56,281 --> 00:09:57,990
his ass story.
Starfish,

230
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,470
starfish.
Maybe he didn't trust his roommate's

231
00:10:01,471 --> 00:10:01,831
like,
man,

232
00:10:01,831 --> 00:10:03,450
if I leave,
this is a hundred bags of heroin.

233
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,650
Well these motherfuckers to get itself.
He went to the gym.

234
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:07,641
He's like,
man,

235
00:10:07,641 --> 00:10:10,850
I can't fit it in my pocket.
I can't leave.

236
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:15,560
I can't leave it in my dash.
Let's work on that star fish.

237
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,860
The glove box is full.
Hmm.

238
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,970
Maybe I just stuffed this up my ass.
Hmm.

239
00:10:21,971 --> 00:10:24,140
Can I fit a hundred bags?
Well,

240
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,140
let's see.
Five,

241
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,480
six.
Wow.

242
00:10:28,481 --> 00:10:30,100
Am I really going to get 94?

243
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:34,040
Dr. Steven Greer,
if you don't know who Dr. Greer is,

244
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:39,070
there's a thing that a lot of people are
aware of that came out was at 20 2011,

245
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:43,310
the disclosure project,
was it 2001 2011.

246
00:10:43,311 --> 00:10:45,710
I met one I meant right around September
11th,

247
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:47,270
and that's where the 11 came from my
head.

248
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,120
Um,
2001,

249
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,960
uh,
it was a huge,

250
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,220
uh,
in the Internet,

251
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:57,110
a huge point of controversy and a,
a topic of conversation.

252
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,060
It was you,
uh,

253
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:02,480
on stage introducing this disclosure
project,

254
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:05,160
explaining how much information,
uh,

255
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,410
you had,
uh,

256
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:10,730
access to about alien spacecrafts
visiting earth and how many

257
00:11:10,731 --> 00:11:14,000
distinguished high ranking military
people.

258
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:16,550
And that was where it got shocking,
uh,

259
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:17,380
agreed with you.
Yeah.

260
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:17,681
And,
yeah,

261
00:11:17,681 --> 00:11:20,200
one of the interesting thing,
after we put this briefing together for

262
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,500
Clinton and,
uh,

263
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,870
you know,
Laurance Rockefeller,

264
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:26,320
uh,
I put the concept together,

265
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:29,050
the best available evidence and all
these cases,

266
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:32,650
and then Lawrence Rockefeller hosted a
bill and Hillary Clinton at the

267
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:35,080
Rockefeller ranch,
and that it had me out there shortly

268
00:11:35,081 --> 00:11:39,700
before that.
And Mr Rockefeller was the white hat in

269
00:11:39,701 --> 00:11:41,500
the family who wanted to end the
secrecy,

270
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:44,350
unlike some of his,
his family.

271
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:45,541
Uh,
and,

272
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:48,790
and he,
so he said to me one night,

273
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,320
I was at on,
on his porch,

274
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:53,380
on a deck in the grand tetons at the
[inaudible] ranch,

275
00:11:53,381 --> 00:11:54,430
and,
and he said,

276
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:57,820
uh,
we really need you to hurry up and do

277
00:11:57,821 --> 00:11:59,350
this.
And I said,

278
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,071
Oh,
Lawrence,

279
00:12:00,071 --> 00:12:02,860
I'm just a doctor in North Carolina.
I'm working in an er,

280
00:12:02,861 --> 00:12:04,030
you know,
he says,

281
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:04,571
no,
no,

282
00:12:04,571 --> 00:12:05,381
you have to do it.
I said,

283
00:12:05,381 --> 00:12:06,011
no,
Lawrence,

284
00:12:06,011 --> 00:12:07,600
you have to get these guys to do.

285
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,590
He says,
they will never do it.

286
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:09,881
And I said,
Lawrence,

287
00:12:09,881 --> 00:12:10,930
for God's sakes,
you're old,

288
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:13,570
you're rich and you're rockefeller.
And he says,

289
00:12:13,571 --> 00:12:14,141
no.
He says,

290
00:12:14,141 --> 00:12:18,970
the implications of this are so vast.
And so profound that no aspect of life

291
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,130
will be unchanged when it comes out.
I said,

292
00:12:21,131 --> 00:12:21,761
yes,
Lawrence,

293
00:12:21,761 --> 00:12:24,340
that's why it's secret.
And then he said to me,

294
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:26,650
well,
that means those folks aren't going to

295
00:12:26,651 --> 00:12:27,484
do it.
And then,

296
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,740
you know,
before that,

297
00:12:29,741 --> 00:12:32,110
as shortly after that,
and I had this,

298
00:12:32,111 --> 00:12:34,480
um,
meeting with the CIA director and,

299
00:12:34,481 --> 00:12:37,570
and,
and one of the president's friends came

300
00:12:37,571 --> 00:12:39,970
to my house and this was a very
disturbing story.

301
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:42,520
I'm sitting at the table with my four
kids,

302
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:47,230
four daughters,
and this man who's very close friends

303
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:48,460
with the president,
uh,

304
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:51,060
Clinton says to me,
um,

305
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:51,941
well,
you know,

306
00:12:51,941 --> 00:12:54,330
they're very supportive of what you've
recommended in this white patriarch.

307
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,213
I said,
great.

308
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,610
And he says,
but they're not going to do it.

309
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,080
I said,
why not?

310
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,980
He says,
they're convinced that if the president

311
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:04,780
steps into this too hard,
he'll end up like Jack Kennedy.

312
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:06,700
And I started laughing,
thinking,

313
00:13:06,701 --> 00:13:11,200
what a load of nonsense.
And he stopped me.

314
00:13:11,201 --> 00:13:11,501
He says,
no,

315
00:13:11,501 --> 00:13:12,340
they're serious.
I said,

316
00:13:12,341 --> 00:13:13,750
well,
don't say this in front of the kids.

317
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,810
So we went to the library in my house,
um,

318
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:19,180
after dinner,
and I said,

319
00:13:19,181 --> 00:13:21,460
what are you talking about Kevin?
And he said,

320
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,770
they really think this is too dangerous.
I said,

321
00:13:23,771 --> 00:13:24,880
well,
what am I supposed to do?

322
00:13:24,881 --> 00:13:27,340
What am I chop liver?
And he looked at me and he says,

323
00:13:27,341 --> 00:13:28,360
yeah,
you're expendable.

324
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,730
So I've always viewed myself as the kind
of the throwaway guy and all of this.

325
00:13:33,731 --> 00:13:36,350
I'm in the sense that these guys,
you know,

326
00:13:36,351 --> 00:13:38,260
the,
the folks who have enormous political

327
00:13:38,261 --> 00:13:40,130
power and corporate power,
uh,

328
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:42,220
even the ones who support this very
avidly,

329
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:44,170
and there's a lot of them,
um,

330
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,970
they don't want to stick their necks
out,

331
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:46,810
but I'm confused.

332
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:49,930
Okay.
Why would they kill Bill Clinton if Bill

333
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:54,220
Clinton came out and said that we may
have evidence that there might be some

334
00:13:54,221 --> 00:13:56,470
intelligent life out there in the world
or universe?

335
00:13:56,471 --> 00:13:57,160
She goes,
you know,

336
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,920
it's like the rem song.
It's the end of the world as we know it.

337
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,460
Because if that,
if that happens when that happens,

338
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,050
people would panic.
No,

339
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:05,401
no,
no,

340
00:14:05,401 --> 00:14:05,651
no,
no,

341
00:14:05,651 --> 00:14:07,000
no.
The public isn't going to panic over

342
00:14:07,001 --> 00:14:08,950
this unless it's couched in a stupid
way.

343
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,780
Well,
the public definitely will panic if the

344
00:14:10,781 --> 00:14:12,500
president comes out and says,
Ufo is,

345
00:14:12,501 --> 00:14:15,580
and then he gets whacked.
That would lead to panic.

346
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,130
Yeah,
but there's a bigger problem if the

347
00:14:18,131 --> 00:14:21,340
president doesn't have control access
over these projects.

348
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:24,850
He didn't want to talk about it because
then it shows the fact that our

349
00:14:24,851 --> 00:14:29,851
democracy has been side lined as
eisenhower warned us experience

350
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:37,560
[inaudible].
