1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,320
Young Jamie [inaudible].

2
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:12,100
Merry Christmas motherfuckers.
Brendan sharp with the Gucci Shoes on.

3
00:00:12,781 --> 00:00:15,930
How dare you,
how dare you,

4
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,940
and he's got cammo with Polka dots.
I want to suggest for you,

5
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,000
it says blind on one shoe and love on 
the other.

6
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:30,140
Oh Lord.
How dare you even leave just for you.

7
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,110
The shows you did much soccer.
He liked those shoes.

8
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:38,010
The shoes I wore just for you.
It's a little bit of romance,

9
00:00:38,011 --> 00:00:40,620
a little bit of my style camera with 
Polka dots on it.

10
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,010
The Day George Michael Died.
It's like a good,

11
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:46,920
it's good jacket to have on.
What did he die of?

12
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:49,140
He'd had a heart attack apparently.
Yeah,

13
00:00:49,141 --> 00:00:52,260
that one was hard for me.
Really fucking love that guy.

14
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,950
That song freedom.
That's what fucking jam.

15
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:56,813
That song has like four parts.
People don't understand that there's 

16
00:00:59,881 --> 00:01:01,500
like,
I think it's four,

17
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,950
but there's every part is just amazing.

18
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:08,190
That's a great fucking song.
I'm a little too.

19
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,353
I wish I could play it be we.
We'll definitely get kicked off of 

20
00:01:12,991 --> 00:01:14,790
youtube if we play it and we put it on 
Youtube.

21
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:15,953
But there's,
there's that video that they made with 

22
00:01:17,341 --> 00:01:20,430
all those supermodels.
So Christy Turlington and all those,

23
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:21,480
all those,
uh,

24
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,630
Naomi Campbell and all those different 
supermodels in their all wandered around

25
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,430
and there's,
they're singing the song,

26
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,990
they're like lip sync and hence the 
video.

27
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:29,640
Yeah,
it's fucking amazing.

28
00:01:29,641 --> 00:01:30,474
Yeah.
I just know they'd wake me up before he 

29
00:01:32,281 --> 00:01:35,370
coco that's in zoo lander.
He had some ridiculous songs,

30
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:36,293
you know,
I think freedom is the only one I ever 

31
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:44,000
like.
I didn't like,

32
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,930
you know,
like wake me up before we go,

33
00:01:45,931 --> 00:01:46,591
go,
come on.

34
00:01:46,591 --> 00:01:47,940
That's a terrible,
there's the video.

35
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:49,920
It's awesome.
Did you like,

36
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,950
I want your sex.
I'm not mad at it wasn't a fan of that.

37
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:00,600
It sounds like these are fucking shot.
The kids.

38
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:01,773
Awesome.
He's so good on his knees with a 

39
00:02:10,651 --> 00:02:12,290
undercover cop or something like that 
and,

40
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:14,640
and no one gave a shit like no one gave 
me.

41
00:02:14,641 --> 00:02:17,300
She was loud about good.
Who Cares?

42
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,650
So wait a minute,
here's my problem with that.

43
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:20,873
What the fuck did the undercover cop say
to get him on his knees and suck his 

44
00:02:23,971 --> 00:02:26,950
Dick Restroom?
No.

45
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:28,320
No.
How did it start off?

46
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,170
It wasn't like,
Hey,

47
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,680
I bought those lakers.
No,

48
00:02:31,681 --> 00:02:32,590
he was probably like,
Hey,

49
00:02:32,591 --> 00:02:34,350
you want you to dick suck.
I'll suck your Dick.

50
00:02:34,351 --> 00:02:37,530
You suck mine.
Like he probably said something probably

51
00:02:37,531 --> 00:02:38,364
don't say Suck Dick.
They probably got code word code words 

52
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,910
Woodward's right.
You want some sausage,

53
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:45,180
Bro?
What'd they say?

54
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,640
We're looking for Bro.
I looked for some friendship.

55
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:51,870
Friendship.
Great.

56
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,470
I got some friendship boy.
Yeah.

57
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,770
Do you remember when that,
um,

58
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:55,963
that Sam,
was he a senator or congressman or some 

59
00:02:57,901 --> 00:02:59,980
shit?
That guy was an anti gay

60
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,080
crusader.
We always,

61
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:01,923
my favorite dudes got caught in a 
bathroom stall in like Minneapolis and 

62
00:03:06,131 --> 00:03:06,964
he was doing that foot tapping thing.
They have like a code Morse code for 

63
00:03:10,301 --> 00:03:11,134
gay.
He tap your feet four times and dudes 

64
00:03:12,721 --> 00:03:15,760
and let you into the stall and you suck 
each other off.

65
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,223
Larry's grades are in the dude's right.
Kind of dudes are into dudes when these 

66
00:03:23,321 --> 00:03:25,060
kinds of dudes are in dudes.
Yeah.

67
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:30,690
But I think if I think it generally,
what did you watch modern family.

68
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,043
You ever watch?
No.

69
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:36,323
Do they have,
it's a few families and have a gay 

70
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:40,110
family.
Uh,

71
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:43,390
they have two dudes and they adopt,
they adopted a girl.

72
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:45,100
She's an Asian girl.
But those guys,

73
00:03:45,101 --> 00:03:50,101
there's been a couple episodes where 
this is on ABC modern family where uh,

74
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:56,820
the gay couple at some college boys move
in next door and then one of the guys is

75
00:03:57,761 --> 00:03:58,594
like hanging out with them and he feels 
like he's in college again and he's 

76
00:04:00,101 --> 00:04:04,480
partying with them and he kind of has a 
crush on one of the guys,

77
00:04:04,481 --> 00:04:06,940
like the main guy and his husband.

78
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,870
It's like you gotta crush blank they're 
talking about and he's like,

79
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:10,631
like,
no,

80
00:04:10,631 --> 00:04:11,464
I don't have a crush.
But like it's obvious that he does and 

81
00:04:13,391 --> 00:04:15,430
it's okay.
That's fine.

82
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,691
That's fine.
No,

83
00:04:16,691 --> 00:04:19,690
I know.
But if it was a heterosexual couple,

84
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:20,773
no,
that would never be a situation like 

85
00:04:21,911 --> 00:04:22,301
that.
Oh,

86
00:04:22,301 --> 00:04:25,050
they've done that before.
Take a pilot,

87
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:25,893
a couple.
I had a crush on someone's wife for 

88
00:04:29,141 --> 00:04:30,640
sure.
For sure.

89
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,100
A hot neighbor moves in.
Right.

90
00:04:33,101 --> 00:04:33,934
But it is like where the guys like 
admitting that he has a crush on the 

91
00:04:36,461 --> 00:04:38,230
neighbor's wife,
like latently,

92
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,100
is that what you're saying?
No,

93
00:04:39,101 --> 00:04:41,690
it's more like a,
you can tell there's,

94
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:46,920
there's a heterosexual couple in the 
Sitcom and a bunch of girls move in next

95
00:04:48,161 --> 00:04:48,994
door and then the guys hanging out with 
the girls and he has a crush on one of 

96
00:04:54,221 --> 00:04:55,900
the girls and it's okay with this wife.

97
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:59,290
She thinks it's kind of cute.
That's weird.

98
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,490
Right?
That would never happen.

99
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,260
I'm confused.
Is the husband,

100
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:03,490
I never,
never watched the show.

101
00:05:03,491 --> 00:05:05,530
So help me out.
Is the husband gay?

102
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,420
I don't know what you're saying.
That's a gay couple.

103
00:05:07,421 --> 00:05:08,254
So it came up a gay cop and a young and 
a young college kids move in next door 

104
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:13,773
and one of the guys,
one of the gay couples crushing on the 

105
00:05:18,581 --> 00:05:19,414
guys that were one of the guys that 
moved in next door and it's kind of a 

106
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,950
cutesy crush.
Oh Wow.

107
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:24,813
And they're really blatant about it.
Like he comes over and there's like 

108
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:28,294
these moments of like he's being 
flustered and I have nothing against 

109
00:05:32,981 --> 00:05:33,814
that.
But I'm just saying you would never see 

110
00:05:34,991 --> 00:05:38,770
that in a heterosexual couple on ABC now
on ABC.

111
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:40,720
Well I think some hardcore stuff right 
there.

112
00:05:40,721 --> 00:05:42,360
I think even though a lot,
what does that mean?

113
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,473
Well,
a lot of times gay couples will take 

114
00:05:44,351 --> 00:05:48,430
like traditional sort of almost husband 
and wife type roles.

115
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:51,250
Like it's really common for sure.
One of the,

116
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,093
one of the guys makes all the money and 
the other guy sorta stays at home and 

117
00:05:54,611 --> 00:05:57,620
maybe they even adopted kid and he like 
raises like a mom.

118
00:05:57,621 --> 00:05:58,310
Like yeah,

119
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,143
like it's so,
but I think ultimately we still accept 

120
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,400
that gay guys are guys and the guys are 
just going to be different.

121
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,940
The same as like two girls becoming 
lesbian.

122
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:11,993
They're not going,
I mean it's like people aren't asexual 

123
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,810
if they're gay,
you know?

124
00:06:14,811 --> 00:06:15,644
So people becoming lesbians,
they would probably have a different 

125
00:06:17,571 --> 00:06:20,420
attitude about monogamy than people 
becoming gay.

126
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,920
I would just imagine.
Yeah.

127
00:06:21,921 --> 00:06:26,270
It seems like overall lesbians are like,
they're,

128
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:28,550
they're letting love in,
they're monogamous.

129
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,533
It seems that when it seems like gay 
dudes are like open about not being 

130
00:06:32,721 --> 00:06:35,300
monogamous and Nicola [inaudible] I 
don't know too much.

131
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,350
I don't know too many lesbians that 
where I've gone deep into their life.

132
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,940
More monogamous.
It seems like generally lesbians or more

133
00:06:43,941 --> 00:06:44,774
girly and monogamous love.
I feel like super weird about asking 

134
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,590
that kind of shit to a lesbian,
like a gay dude.

135
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:52,880
I could ask a gay dude,
they're like,

136
00:06:52,881 --> 00:06:55,110
Justin Martindale.
I could ask that dude anything.

137
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,600
Generally wilder ride,
they're like,

138
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,583
yeah,
guys are like guys and girls are like 

139
00:06:59,841 --> 00:07:01,910
girls,
whether they're lesbians or gay dudes.

140
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:03,203
You right.
That's what the girls like a super like 

141
00:07:05,421 --> 00:07:06,860
masculine,
like,

142
00:07:06,861 --> 00:07:07,780
like a male.
Uh,

143
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:11,300
butchy gay girls generally still don't 
feel comfortable asking him.

144
00:07:11,301 --> 00:07:11,950
Like,
you know,

145
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:15,380
like how it works.
They might get offended.

146
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,620
There's not lesbians meeting each other 
and bathrooms.

147
00:07:18,621 --> 00:07:21,020
It's not girls doing that.
Right.

148
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:21,883
Generally it's usually these,
they push each other into a stall and 

149
00:07:26,601 --> 00:07:29,480
they started making out the heterosexual
world.

150
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:33,140
What percentage of strip clubs in the 
United States are for men?

151
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:39,550
Well,
there's a lot more [inaudible].

152
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:45,920
There's like one chippendale's,
the county shit.

153
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:50,170
You got to do some research and if 
they're only open on,

154
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,013
you know,
you gotta make your reservations and 

155
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:56,180
shit the fucking like,
it's a different experience.

156
00:07:56,181 --> 00:08:00,080
Like when girls go to see men strip,
they scream,

157
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,260
they scream and they throw money in the 
air,

158
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:06,710
they get crazy and they'll rub their 
face on the dude's dicks.

159
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:09,170
Like girls at Bachelorette parties,
they go,

160
00:08:09,171 --> 00:08:12,950
fucking ma'am.
Is it because they don't go as much?

161
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,000
Like as often,
you know,

162
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,330
in the agreement they could go off on 
bachelor parties and they're not.

163
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:19,910
Yeah,
they're not going to say shit.

164
00:08:19,911 --> 00:08:22,670
It's like what happens at the 
Bachelorette party stays there.

165
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,833
Right.
I had a friend of mine who I used to do 

166
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:29,120
taekwondo with that was a male stripper,
two friends of mine actually.

167
00:08:29,121 --> 00:08:31,670
One was his young Puerto Rican kid and 
the other one,

168
00:08:31,671 --> 00:08:32,504
this is older white dude and the older 
bite to it was a really nice guy and 

169
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,410
very smart guy,
but he was like over the top.

170
00:08:39,411 --> 00:08:42,290
Strange Big Jack.
Was He shredded though?

171
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,040
Jack Black Belt.
Black Belt martial artist.

172
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:47,670
He was a big Jack Dude,
you know,

173
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,130
but he was telling me,
he was like,

174
00:08:49,131 --> 00:08:50,720
these women,
they go fucking crazy.

175
00:08:50,721 --> 00:08:51,554
Like it gets really scratching column 
and she just sucking tech daughter 

176
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,100
friends.

177
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:56,933
The girls who were getting married,
we just suck his dick in front of their 

178
00:08:58,231 --> 00:08:59,064
friends,
cut to the guys strip club to dudes by 

179
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,784
himself in the quarter,
all quiet as flushing fucking strip 

180
00:09:10,381 --> 00:09:15,120
clubs when it was dead as fuck.
I worked those Saturday day shifts,

181
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:16,043
that shit is,
you open up at 11 and there's one girl 

182
00:09:18,571 --> 00:09:19,404
and no dude's this weight.
You're looking at the security cameras 

183
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:29,590
to see and then one guy walks in,
boom knee sit there and he's,

184
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,873
it's Saturday and one 15 girl.
She's fucking in Shitty Shit and I'm 

185
00:09:42,091 --> 00:09:44,010
sitting there playing depeche mode and 
shit.

186
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:52,880
It was dark big.
My friends like,

187
00:09:52,881 --> 00:09:53,714
dude,
you're so lucky you were in a strip 

188
00:09:55,150 --> 00:10:00,150
club,
just origins going on and I'm like,

189
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,510
dude,
you get me a job,

190
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:17,050
I'll just pick up cokes.
Larry said,

191
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:21,420
man,
you're so lucky.

192
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:22,260
I'm like,
ah.

193
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,200
But then ended up moving up and getting 
good shifts.

194
00:10:25,201 --> 00:10:27,540
You just wait for the Nike Jan?
Yeah.

195
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:29,520
When you first get in,
you got the worst shifts.

196
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:32,100
Saturday day,
Monday day,

197
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:37,310
Saturday day darkness,
just dead.

198
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,630
There's a UFC fighter is a stripper for 
awhile.

199
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,390
Crunchyroll Detroit superstar.
Yeah.

200
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:45,120
He's over in Japan now.
He's fighting for a rising.

201
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:45,960
Oh,
that's right.

202
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,070
Yeah.
He's over there now.

203
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:49,530
He was American ripper.
He's a funny dude,

204
00:10:49,531 --> 00:10:50,364
man.
He's got a hilarious mustache now to 

205
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,910
follow his instagram.
It's awesome,

206
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:56,880
but it's just him shooting things.
He's a fucking sadness.

207
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,530
He used to fight in UFC.
Yeah.

208
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:03,570
Dan cruickshank probably run through 
more rounds of ammunition than anyone in

209
00:11:03,571 --> 00:11:05,220
this entire town in a year.

210
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,720
Fuck yeah,
he's crazy.

211
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:09,950
He's out there shooting shit constantly 
does instagram.

212
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:13,200
It's all just him gunning things down.
He's a wild motherfucker dude.

213
00:11:13,201 --> 00:11:15,240
He's fun to watch fight.
He's a good fighter.

214
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,550
He know.
He was getting more and more comfortable

215
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,413
with keeping fight standing and is when 
he became more and more comfortable 

216
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:21,804
keeping fight standing.
Then you get to see how good his 

217
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:26,360
kickboxing skill is.
He's a really good kickboxer.

218
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,370
Really good.
I know I say kickboxing mean is boxing.

219
00:11:29,371 --> 00:11:31,230
She'll at least the traditional martial 
arts basically,

220
00:11:31,231 --> 00:11:32,370
right?
Like what was his,

221
00:11:32,371 --> 00:11:33,870
uh,
his original background,

222
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,500
karate or taekwondo.
It,

223
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,590
it's really,
really good man.

224
00:11:37,591 --> 00:11:39,660
Really good kicker.
And so like,

225
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,673
you know,
when a guy like that makes that 

226
00:11:41,911 --> 00:11:46,911
transition hilarious.
Jack Jacked with a candy cane Roos Dick,

227
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,540
let that go back to that Jamie.
It's fucking,

228
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:54,100
you be like,
look at us.

229
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,570
Look at the first one you see.

230
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,880
The first one you see is if you click on
that video,

231
00:11:57,881 --> 00:12:01,060
it's Darrin cruickshank just fucking 
going crazy with a machine gun.

232
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:04,270
He's just fucking shooting things 
constantly,

233
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,440
man.
This dude,

234
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,050
oh dude.
If the fucking shit goes down,

235
00:12:11,051 --> 00:12:14,170
go to Darin crookshanks house and ask if
you can get it.

236
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:19,320
He's a fucking look at another video 
looking at,

237
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:24,420
he's got a picture of all these Japanese
girls staring at his package lasering in

238
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:27,460
on his dick like agenda is what they're 
doing.

239
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:31,660
Then he's killing it out there.
Whoa.

240
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,760
I mean that's a hilarious picture 
though.

241
00:12:33,761 --> 00:12:35,050
He's a funny dude,
man.

242
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,063
And I don't see,
I don't think the UFC figured out how 

243
00:12:40,151 --> 00:12:41,920
to,
how to recognize that.

244
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:42,783
You know what I'm saying?
Like how many dudes that you see fight 

245
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:49,540
or like kind of almost like the on the 
outside it's like the bland,

246
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:51,670
like everyone's the same because you 
don't get to know them.

247
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,780
You don't get to know like all their 
weirdness.

248
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:57,880
So you know,
if it's differently,

249
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,160
it's flat,
it's flat.

250
00:13:00,161 --> 00:13:00,994
So you need a story but on a reason why 
to tune into the fight crunch has a 

251
00:13:04,061 --> 00:13:05,980
great story.
He's a great story man.

252
00:13:05,981 --> 00:13:09,850
Do you think some people,
um,

253
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:14,110
had wore certain shorts and you 
recognize them by their shorts,

254
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:14,950
like with soccer,
rob,

255
00:13:14,951 --> 00:13:19,930
but he had the warrant,
the flames and now,

256
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,280
now that,
uh,

257
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:24,240
everybody's going to reebok,
it takes away some,

258
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:26,980
a little value if what you're saying is 
correct.

259
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:32,310
If it said adding personality adds value
to the fighters,

260
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:34,330
which adds value to the show.
Correct.

261
00:13:34,331 --> 00:13:37,180
Hundred percent.
So actually letting them and encouraging

262
00:13:37,181 --> 00:13:38,890
them and letting them get a rash,
guards and shit.

263
00:13:38,891 --> 00:13:39,724
You want to win.
You want to be the fight of the waiters 

264
00:13:40,391 --> 00:13:41,350
or rash guard.
Fuck yeah,

265
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,090
it's not a problem in women's mma.

266
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:45,760
I don't see why it would be a problem.
And men's MMA.

267
00:13:45,761 --> 00:13:47,560
Tell him,
show me the logic there.

268
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:50,940
They,
they should encourage fighters to,

269
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:52,043
uh,
where different Shit Melvin can imagine 

270
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:57,250
spots.
I know that would grip.

271
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:58,143
Oh Shit.
Girls.

272
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:00,620
Girls are wearing rash guards.
Yeah.

273
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:01,853
I mean that's rash guard.
We'll fucking help your grappling for 

274
00:14:04,481 --> 00:14:06,880
sure.
It's a big factor.

275
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:08,470
It's a big factor.
Yeah.

276
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,750
Uh,
why they don't allow,

277
00:14:10,751 --> 00:14:11,584
I mean,
they just haven't really thought about 

278
00:14:12,281 --> 00:14:13,660
it.
No one's actually just sat them down.

279
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:16,990
It's all the best.
Melvin manhoef when he fought k one,

280
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,510
he wore them gladiator type art and 
cloudy.

281
00:14:19,511 --> 00:14:20,850
Yeah.
Do you ever he,

282
00:14:20,851 --> 00:14:22,240
he started,
started wearing those things,

283
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,103
you know,
start,

284
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:28,260
it started that we stumbled Mcdonald.
I'll go you one better.

285
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,010
Alexis Arguayo.
No,

286
00:14:30,011 --> 00:14:31,090
not a wreck.
Stark whale.

287
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,180
A Dennis Alexia.
Alexia used to fight it.

288
00:14:34,181 --> 00:14:38,770
A grass skirt straight up.
A straight up Hawaiian grass skirt.

289
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,530
Mcdonald had like straight spartan.
How bout,

290
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,780
how bout Shinay Yucky when he was 
wearing them yellow tie to the rainbow.

291
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:45,963
He was known for a statue.
Couldn't wait to see what's new about 

292
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:52,120
collarbone and look that scary to watch 
that

293
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:55,070
shit allow that.
They shouldn't encourage that.

294
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,630
They're not cleaning product.
Dell had those blue shorts,

295
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:01,150
the iceman shorts,
the pink ones.

296
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,310
That's the personality.
If they wear uniforms,

297
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,080
they don't want to look more like every 
other league though.

298
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:10,010
But it's a man on man.
It's personality on personality.

299
00:15:10,011 --> 00:15:11,720
It's one,
one dude.

300
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,460
So his personnel,
just one dude,

301
00:15:13,461 --> 00:15:15,050
that person,
even if it's for dudes,

302
00:15:15,051 --> 00:15:16,750
all their personalities,
you know,

303
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,590
once you get to know him,
they become important,

304
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,453
you know?
So the more you understand everybody in 

305
00:15:21,651 --> 00:15:24,710
this case just to fighters,
I also think that making it,

306
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:27,200
I mean if you want to have a company 
that sponsors it,

307
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:31,640
that the two aren't mutually exclusive.
It's not like a company can't sponsor it

308
00:15:31,641 --> 00:15:35,360
and still have dope shorts that are 
different for each fighter.

309
00:15:35,361 --> 00:15:38,930
We have someone design their own stuff.
You don't have to have,

310
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:40,143
you know,
the same like you have read and I have 

311
00:15:41,271 --> 00:15:42,680
blue,
like why correct.

312
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,570
It doesn't matter.
Everybody knows you're you.

313
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,130
Everybody knows you're you.
Like what?

314
00:15:46,131 --> 00:15:48,110
Who are we confused?
Like do we,

315
00:15:48,111 --> 00:15:49,730
who's the Red Guy?
The right guy on top?

316
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,110
Who's the blue?
The WHO's winning?

317
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,033
Well,
I just feel like it takes away from the 

318
00:15:53,211 --> 00:15:54,044
sport when you make everyone looked the 
same like in the nfl or something like 

319
00:15:56,721 --> 00:15:57,554
that total because what people buy into 
and fighting and it's true with box and 

320
00:16:00,831 --> 00:16:01,664
it's true with mma.
They want to know why they should watch 

321
00:16:04,161 --> 00:16:04,994
the fight.
Cause you can put a fight on access tv 

322
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:09,230
if you don't know the fight.
If you know nothing about them,

323
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:11,040
they don't get,
they get the ratings.

324
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:12,690
But he loves cowboy.
Yeah,

325
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:13,630
exactly.
His,

326
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,080
his story,
his story.

327
00:16:15,081 --> 00:16:15,914
We know,
you know we know John Jones story now 

328
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,800
because this has been going through all 
this crazy shit and we know cyborg story

329
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,753
and it could take to kick this thing off
whether you want to talk about or not 

330
00:16:25,011 --> 00:16:25,610
and you let me know.

331
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:26,443
But with Amanda Nunez,
imagine just put yourself in her shoes 

332
00:16:30,711 --> 00:16:32,810
right now.
Imagine having the biggest fight of your

333
00:16:32,811 --> 00:16:35,870
life ever and the the,
the fight.

334
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:36,813
Everyone's looking for a specialty or 
female fighter because you get so much 

335
00:16:38,811 --> 00:16:39,644
notoriety.
You get all the camera's pointed at you 

336
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:42,163
people,
you finally get to hear your story and 

337
00:16:43,521 --> 00:16:46,370
she has a great story and then he can't 
do interviews.

338
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,620
There's none of that.
There's no promotion.

339
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:51,020
We're not going to show your videos,
can't do interviews.

340
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:54,140
There should be no open workouts.
Imagine being her right now.

341
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:57,080
Like what the fuck?
Well,

342
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:01,580
the good news is she can concentrate on 
the fight and just constant.

343
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:02,443
The the would always do that.
I understand that and the good news for 

344
00:17:04,551 --> 00:17:07,490
Rhonda is that she can also just 
concentrate and the fight,

345
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,140
but she doesn't have to do any of these 
interviews.

346
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,960
I liked that,
but I don't like is,

347
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,333
I feel like we have to respect what a 
champion is and it doesn't matter if 

348
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:21,620
you're the most famous person,
you're still the champion.

349
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:22,663
And we,
we are the champion of a giant 

350
00:17:24,021 --> 00:17:29,021
organization like the UFC.
And how about she's the first openly gay

351
00:17:29,391 --> 00:17:32,520
women's MMA champion ever or amazing 
stolen champion.

352
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:33,803
I'm a champion.
There's never been an openly gay mma 

353
00:17:35,811 --> 00:17:36,644
champion and she's fucking bad ass.
It's not like she doesn't have a 

354
00:17:40,161 --> 00:17:40,994
highlight reel and it's not like she's 
grabbing a hold of these girls and just 

355
00:17:43,161 --> 00:17:46,550
sort of winning by staying on top and do
nothing.

356
00:17:46,551 --> 00:17:48,950
So there's no highlights you can pull.
Oh,

357
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,040
she knocks girls out

358
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,050
and choke them unconscious.
She's very good.

359
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:55,920
So it's exciting.
It's an exciting technical match up.

360
00:17:56,430 --> 00:18:00,090
It's an exciting story with Ronda coming
back after being out for over a year.

361
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:05,120
There's so much exciting shit,
but to concentrate only on one person to

362
00:18:05,431 --> 00:18:07,710
sell it.
I understand that that person is huge.

363
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:10,020
I understand that person's the biggest 
person.

364
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:12,390
She's probably right up there with 
connor.

365
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,640
I would go.
They both go back and forth.

366
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:18,240
What do you think conor is bigger?
That's not an argument.

367
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:18,960
I would,
um,

368
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,010
I would agree with you.
I would,

369
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,700
I would lean towards that.
My point is let's,

370
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:26,220
with one victory,
she could get launched right into that,

371
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,310
that place again,
I think it's a weird thing,

372
00:18:29,311 --> 00:18:30,600
man.
It's like you're,

373
00:18:30,601 --> 00:18:35,601
you're a super talented person who's 
also this giant personality figure.

374
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,280
It's,
it's,

375
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,220
it's more than just a fighter,
right?

376
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:44,370
It becomes his personality figure,
especially for common like that,

377
00:18:44,371 --> 00:18:45,204
that his whole shit talking and 
marketing and he sends out a tweet to 

378
00:18:48,811 --> 00:18:49,620
sell the fight.

379
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:52,140
Part of being a fighter is selling the 
fight.

380
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:53,790
See what you want about floyd 
mayweather.

381
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:54,893
There's not an interviewer camera heat 
in it looked towards to sell that 

382
00:18:57,331 --> 00:19:00,550
Pacquiao fight cause in the end it helps
the company helps.

383
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:03,810
It puts more money in your pocket,
it helps sponsorship everything.

384
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,630
You can't say anything about floyd 
unless you were one of those girls.

385
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:11,830
You smacked that well,
but it's part of the Gig.

386
00:19:11,891 --> 00:19:12,990
You,
you've got to sell the fight.

387
00:19:12,991 --> 00:19:13,824
So for me,
and I think Rhonda is the favorite in 

388
00:19:17,101 --> 00:19:17,934
this matchup,
but she has to create these scenarios 

389
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:23,250
where it's me against the world.
It's me against you.

390
00:19:23,251 --> 00:19:25,830
Sure she's creating and this,
and this is a big marketing push.

391
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:27,210
This is like,
you know,

392
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,073
this is the new owners of the UFC and 
this is this and this is the really 

393
00:19:30,911 --> 00:19:31,744
banjo,
but this is this really a cinematic 

394
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:36,120
thing that we're missing the boat on.

395
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:38,460
What would definitely mention the boat,
the numbers will prove it.

396
00:19:38,461 --> 00:19:41,940
I bet you we'll definitely miss the boat
on promoting Amanda,

397
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,030
that that for a fact,
but you don't think it was like a pretty

398
00:19:45,031 --> 00:19:48,360
exciting promo piece.
I saw that Promo piece that got me fired

399
00:19:48,361 --> 00:19:51,420
up.
I think the good thing is that it's like

400
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:54,060
it's really exciting.
Very well done.

401
00:19:54,061 --> 00:19:55,770
Cool thing.
You gift,

402
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,370
it's a garage door.
You think this fight has as much promos?

403
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,800
Say UFC two oh five in New York.
No,

404
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:02,723
no I don't.
Or The conor fight cause I didn't know 

405
00:20:04,471 --> 00:20:06,390
because no one's doing interviews.
Yeah,

406
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:11,450
no I 100% completely agree with you to 
that point but part of me likes,

407
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,433
I want to see what happens when the pay 
per view numbers come out because part 

408
00:20:15,691 --> 00:20:18,090
of me likes that the fighters aren't 
going to be bothered.

409
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,700
I don't think you need to bother them as
much as they get bothered.

410
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:21,773
I think when connor was,
was pissed off about it when all those 

411
00:20:24,091 --> 00:20:24,924
pissed off button will always different 
fighters who were doing these crazy 

412
00:20:26,431 --> 00:20:28,380
tours are pissed off about this 
promotion thing.

413
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:29,703
The,
the idea about it as you trying to get 

414
00:20:31,351 --> 00:20:33,030
the word out to as many people as 
possible,

415
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:33,893
but I don't know if like that the price 
that they pay and being distracted from 

416
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:41,390
their training.
I don't know if it's 100% worth it.

417
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,320
You're talking about a world tour where 
he's like,

418
00:20:43,321 --> 00:20:44,041
dude,
come on,

419
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:46,380
I'm coming off the loss.
Nate Diaz is a tough fight for me.

420
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:48,130
One 70 I need everything

421
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:48,963
I can do to,
to get this fight and get my mind right 

422
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,260
with Rhonda helps.
Do you think that it helps these,

423
00:20:53,261 --> 00:20:56,470
these big promo tours?
Um,

424
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,770
yes and no.
I,

425
00:20:58,790 --> 00:20:59,201
I,
you know,

426
00:20:59,201 --> 00:21:02,590
I don't know if you need to go all 
around the frickin world and promote it,

427
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:05,490
but there needs to be some sort of,
um,

428
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:07,050
publicity done.
The for,

429
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:08,470
for Rhonda especially,

430
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:13,960
I think her as a role model for females.
You can't get kicked in the face,

431
00:21:13,961 --> 00:21:14,794
take your ball and go home.
We want our champ to be like connor or 

432
00:21:17,081 --> 00:21:19,210
someone where they go,
I want back in there,

433
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:21,380
man.
Gimme gimme the fuck back in there.

434
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,293
I need this.
I think that it's cool that obviously 

435
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:28,570
Rhonda doesn't want all that shit.
She's as famous as you can be.

436
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:31,420
She doesn't want that.
And someone just said,

437
00:21:31,421 --> 00:21:32,410
okay,
you know,

438
00:21:32,411 --> 00:21:35,260
they'd let her just have her piece and 
focus on the fight.

439
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,010
I personally don't really watch 
interviews.

440
00:21:39,011 --> 00:21:39,844
I don't watch that press,
so I don't even know how important it 

441
00:21:41,621 --> 00:21:43,510
is.
All I care about is that fight.

442
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:45,010
That's it.
Once the fight happens,

443
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:46,810
give me a little prod you a little 
promo.

444
00:21:46,811 --> 00:21:49,410
Give me a little our promo.
It doesn't have to be like,

445
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:50,890
you know anything fancy.

446
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,350
We're balls deep in it though.
For the casual fan.

447
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:54,543
My Dad's a casual fan.
He has no idea she was fighting this 

448
00:21:56,471 --> 00:21:57,940
Friday.
I don't know.

449
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,900
So for the casual fan,
that's where I would think that it would

450
00:22:01,901 --> 00:22:02,734
make a big difference.
People will watch espn and well that 

451
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:07,510
that's who buys paper views Joe,
because to get that,

452
00:22:07,511 --> 00:22:12,070
to get that 60 $70 and here casual fan,
they need to be sold on.

453
00:22:12,071 --> 00:22:12,904
It sounds like,
it sounds like you own a piece of the 

454
00:22:14,741 --> 00:22:16,810
UFC right now.
You're making good points.

455
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:18,640
Making very good points.
I'm just being fun.

456
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:19,001
No,
no,

457
00:22:19,001 --> 00:22:21,160
I hear you that well,
but you are making very good points.

458
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,840
My,
my issue is in,

459
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:25,690
in Ron can do her thing,
but you can't,

460
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:28,310
it's a conflict of interest.
Here's my,

461
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,860
here's my cousin called me Gregor.
Right.

462
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:30,820
Cause conor goes,
dude,

463
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,830
I'll fly to New York and do a press 
conference,

464
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:34,360
but I'm not going to vegas.
Cool.

465
00:22:34,361 --> 00:22:35,650
You're not fighting.
Right.

466
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,570
Ronnie goes,
I'm not doing shit.

467
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:38,693
He goes,
cool.

468
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:40,420
Different different owners now.

469
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:42,530
Okay.

470
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:44,960
Different owners,
however different approach.

471
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:48,080
I mean it's a different business and in 
the amount of things are changing.

472
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:50,350
They're changing the change.
Joe,

473
00:22:50,351 --> 00:22:53,570
but also wme who owns the UFC manages 
Ronda Rousey.

474
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:55,520
Yeah.
They don't manage conor mcgregor.

475
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,250
Right.
So there's a conflict of interest there.

476
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,770
Well,
um,

477
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:01,220
it depends because it's just a business 
decision.

478
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:04,670
The only people that should be upset or 
probably the other people,

479
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:05,683
what cody garbrandt and dominick Cruz 
aren't restricted from doing any 

480
00:23:08,001 --> 00:23:08,661
interviews.
Right.

481
00:23:08,661 --> 00:23:10,370
They're doing everything they can to 
sell the fight.

482
00:23:10,371 --> 00:23:11,630
That's a problem.
It's good.

483
00:23:11,631 --> 00:23:13,280
They're going to sell them for me.
That's for fuck's sake.

484
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:15,560
I for Fox steep in it for short balls 
deep.

485
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:17,510
The casual fans going,
I'm not buying,

486
00:23:17,511 --> 00:23:21,740
I'm not spend $70 for those small guys.
Now to me it's the number one five.

487
00:23:21,741 --> 00:23:22,574
You know,
to me it's the number one flight on the 

488
00:23:23,481 --> 00:23:24,314
card.
I love cody is my number one fight 

489
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,200
rendered wants his promos.
No,

490
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,350
he's right.
He's right.

491
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:29,651
No,
no,

492
00:23:29,651 --> 00:23:30,810
no.
What I what?

493
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,770
I wasn't added to the UFC to keep 
growing and uh,

494
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,633
it,
it comes with the territory you got to 

495
00:23:36,051 --> 00:23:37,850
sell yourself.
But do you offer the fighters?

496
00:23:37,851 --> 00:23:40,680
I'll don't you think that they're 
respecting their wishes like Rhonda just

497
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:45,380
wanting to be left alone.
She is the exact reason why she's famous

498
00:23:45,381 --> 00:23:46,220
as she is.
Okay

499
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:48,620
though.
Wait a minute,

500
00:23:48,621 --> 00:23:49,454
but you don't have to only do press 
while you were in camp like that media 

501
00:23:52,881 --> 00:23:55,010
exists after the fights,
which is easy for,

502
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:57,560
for everybody just talk after the 
fights.

503
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:58,603
But during the training and preparation,
it's a giant distraction is going to 

504
00:24:01,281 --> 00:24:02,114
take a lot of time.
It did a decision if someone's as rich 

505
00:24:04,551 --> 00:24:09,551
and as famous as Rhonda is a decision to
favor performance over finances.

506
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:11,943
So like maybe she'll make less money but
she thinks that she'll be more focused 

507
00:24:14,781 --> 00:24:16,910
on a performance would be better.
I love that.

508
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:21,620
I love that decision.
I think really well when you're a really

509
00:24:21,621 --> 00:24:23,800
wealthy,
successful athlete like her,

510
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:25,820
you can do whatever the fuck you want.
That's what I think.

511
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:26,773
I think when you get to a point where 
you get to decide whether you're going 

512
00:24:29,331 --> 00:24:30,164
to focus on making more money and 
possibly being less focused and 

513
00:24:33,411 --> 00:24:34,244
distracted and maybe tired or even maybe
get sick cause you're doing a lot of 

514
00:24:36,771 --> 00:24:40,550
traveling versus only dedicate yourself 
to training.

515
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,360
He do all the fucking videos you want.
Put all the promos you want.

516
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:46,490
I'm not doing shit for the next eight 
weeks.

517
00:24:46,491 --> 00:24:48,650
So then where's that?
Who's going to sell the fight?

518
00:24:48,651 --> 00:24:50,980
If everyone has that mentality,
does that,

519
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,910
is that the rule now?
You know what I'm saying?

520
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:53,773
No,
I don't know what you're saying because 

521
00:24:54,531 --> 00:24:57,080
the old way is not the only way.
You could do both ways.

522
00:24:57,081 --> 00:24:59,090
You could do whatever way you want.
They can go side.

523
00:24:59,150 --> 00:24:59,983
They could decide that they're a little 
promo pieces that they could put 

524
00:25:02,091 --> 00:25:05,240
together without interviews are enough.
They could fly.

525
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,260
I might be wrong.
You know what,

526
00:25:06,261 --> 00:25:09,830
they could just fly to her for two days 
interview or at our training camp.

527
00:25:09,831 --> 00:25:11,960
That's what they did for telling me.
And then they take off.

528
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:13,070
Tony was in big,
big,

529
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,470
really never left big bear.
They came to him.

530
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,750
It was no big deal.
It's,

531
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,430
look,
she definitely could do that.

532
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:20,840
Or she could say,
no,

533
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:23,600
I just want to completely focus and 
let's see how this works.

534
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:27,910
Her thing is,
is that she thinks the media backstabbed

535
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,753
her and that's why she won't do an 
interview like they turned on and when 

536
00:25:30,591 --> 00:25:32,600
she lost,
she's a very emotional person.

537
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:35,360
It's one of the reasons,
one of the reasons why she's so good.

538
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,460
I agree.
But she's a very emotional,

539
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:40,160
to me it sounded like my voice was 
cracking up.

540
00:25:40,161 --> 00:25:45,140
I swear it roadmap the Cryo or some 
conversation,

541
00:25:45,141 --> 00:25:46,160
Doug.
Um,

542
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,680
but,
but to me it's,

543
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:50,930
if you're a a Rhonda Fan,
like when you break the site down,

544
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,620
there's an that there's a huge x factor.
What frame of mind is Rhonda?

545
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:58,770
If she won't even face interview.
Okay.

546
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,670
Maybe.
Or maybe that's,

547
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:01,843
yeah,
maybe she's the most folks she's ever 

548
00:26:03,231 --> 00:26:06,120
been or maybe she just can't deal with 
the question.

549
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:08,300
The Fra after the last fight.
We don't know.

550
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,740
Well yeah,
you,

551
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,690
it's,
she's the only one who knows,

552
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,780
you know,
or like you said,

553
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:17,930
famous is fuck lives in a mansion a lot 
about Amanda.

554
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:19,820
Oh yeah.
What about little for her?

555
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:22,520
She should absolutely be able to do as 
many interviews she won,

556
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:25,490
but she might not want to either.
She might want to say,

557
00:26:25,491 --> 00:26:26,360
hey,
good.

558
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:29,210
I'm going to focus entirely on fighting 
Ronda to look.

559
00:26:29,211 --> 00:26:31,430
This might be better.
It might be better this way.

560
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:33,440
It's just like we were talking about 
weight cutting before.

561
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:35,780
It might be better if people didn't 
fucking cut way.

562
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,040
Look up.
God damn good.

563
00:26:37,041 --> 00:26:39,350
Kelvin gaslin looked against Tim 
Kennedy.

564
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:40,580
Look up.
Goddamn good.

565
00:26:40,581 --> 00:26:44,160
Donald cerrone looks Donald's walking 
around like 176 pounds.

566
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:47,940
He's not cutting shit and he looks 
fucking amazing.

567
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:50,670
He's head kick in Matt Brown,
you know he's,

568
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,460
he's running through every book.
Tony doesn't cut that much either.

569
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:55,550
Yeah,
connor,

570
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,990
55 pounds.
Those guys,

571
00:26:57,991 --> 00:26:59,460
man,
they have an advantage.

572
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:01,190
That's a big acid vantage.
Wait,

573
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:01,741
wait,
cut.

574
00:27:01,741 --> 00:27:02,880
Yes,
I agree hugely,

575
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:06,810
but I think the way cut like the,
I think there's benefits to it.

576
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:08,610
Ultimately.
Obviously you're going to be bitter when

577
00:27:08,611 --> 00:27:09,444
you get inside the octagon,
but the performance hit that your body 

578
00:27:11,971 --> 00:27:15,000
takes.
Its super arguable at a certain level.

579
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:18,360
There's a point of diminishing returns 
that a lot of these guys pass through,

580
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:21,660
but then there's a few fucking examples.
Like Damien Maia,

581
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:26,550
Damien Maia cuts a lot of weight and 
he's just rushing people.

582
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:31,610
Anthony Johnson and Johnson's cutting 
that much weight at two oh five bro.

583
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:36,030
I think he might be 10 15 pounds.
No Sir.

584
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:39,190
You're really good at two 22 two eight 
guys.

585
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:41,670
I think he looks really happy as Ken,
who's my offense as much.

586
00:27:41,671 --> 00:27:43,640
For a big guy like that though,
for saying he's,

587
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:44,401
I mean,
20 pounds,

588
00:27:44,401 --> 00:27:45,234
20 pounds,
20 pounds is different when you're a 

589
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:48,340
heavyweight for light heavyweight.
But he's,

590
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,630
he's,
he's lean too.

591
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,990
That's true.
He's jacked.

592
00:27:51,991 --> 00:27:54,990
Who's who's doing in March?
A flight and Damien Maia,

593
00:27:54,991 --> 00:27:55,824
I don't know man.
I think they're waiting to see the 

594
00:27:57,091 --> 00:27:59,430
shadows.
Woodley Woodley.

595
00:27:59,431 --> 00:28:01,140
If Woodley and wonderboy,
you have a rematch.

596
00:28:01,141 --> 00:28:03,630
Woodley's campaigning for a fight with 
Nick Diaz,

597
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:08,490
which I would love to see Woodley get 
fucking paid too.

598
00:28:08,491 --> 00:28:09,720
I like,
I like what he's doing.

599
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:11,040
I liked it.
He's trying to get paid.

600
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:15,600
She is just the big names to make money.
I want to see it happen.

601
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,130
I like,
I like his initiative.

602
00:28:17,131 --> 00:28:18,030
I like it.
You know,

603
00:28:18,031 --> 00:28:18,721
people are like,
oh,

604
00:28:18,721 --> 00:28:19,950
you're just trying to get paid,
bro.

605
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,680
Yeah.
Yes.

606
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,540
By the way,
those are all fucking amazing fights.

607
00:28:24,541 --> 00:28:26,940
Like what are you talking about?
You don't want to see him versus GSP.

608
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,190
Yes.
Tell people to lose your number.

609
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,133
Tell them right now.
Lose your number if you don't want to 

610
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:36,770
see that fight.
He wouldn't want to see that fight.

611
00:28:36,771 --> 00:28:37,604
That's the sport though.
You want the biggest name possible with 

612
00:28:39,271 --> 00:28:40,104
the highest pay day because either way 
you're probably getting punched in the 

613
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:42,370
face.
Hey,

614
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:44,520
but also I want to see the runnable 
wonderboy rematch.

615
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:45,383
I want to see that too.
I do but I'm not upset with any of the 

616
00:28:47,191 --> 00:28:50,280
other seds or GSP.
I honestly,

617
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:51,143
I'm even on it.
I'm even on Diaz GSP or the wonderboy 

618
00:28:54,061 --> 00:28:54,894
rematch.
I won't be mad at you and wonder boys 

619
00:28:55,741 --> 00:28:57,090
up.
Bad motherfucker dude.

620
00:28:57,091 --> 00:28:57,924
And when he was in that guillotine and 
didn't and it looked like his head was 

621
00:29:01,261 --> 00:29:04,530
literally going to be body,
I don't know man.

622
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:05,573
He Ha maybe his neck is so small.
That's what tyler was saying that his 

623
00:29:08,461 --> 00:29:11,400
neck is so small you got to like really 
squeeze it.

624
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:16,560
Someone else was saying that too.
Like his neck is so small.

625
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,833
Maybe he can like make more room because
it's harder to get a really tight 

626
00:29:21,811 --> 00:29:26,150
squeeze on it cause Woodley had some big
ass arms make up for it.

627
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:29,520
Woodley also said that he's got a little
head so his head could pop out easier.

628
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,200
That makes sense.
Right?

629
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:32,843
A small head myself.
It's an advantage not will not when you 

630
00:29:35,531 --> 00:29:38,550
get punched in the face,
if you've got some crazy alex caceres do

631
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:41,800
that has gotta be an advantage to the 
guy hanging on for real.

632
00:29:41,801 --> 00:29:42,634
Right?
Yeah.

633
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:44,890
I mean to Alex.
Cause if you get Alex because Sarah's in

634
00:29:44,891 --> 00:29:45,724
a canteen,
like there's a lot of shit he's got to 

635
00:29:47,291 --> 00:29:49,960
go through on a shit.
It's not like my head was like,

636
00:29:49,961 --> 00:29:51,050
Whoa,
whoa.

637
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:53,270
Remember having uh,
they had homeboy and um,

638
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:54,790
Kenna shave his beard.

639
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,620
Oh that's right.
A meal.

640
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:57,543
A meal mic.
You got a powerful beer cause it was 

641
00:29:58,841 --> 00:30:00,610
called himself a meal.
Meek forever.

642
00:30:00,611 --> 00:30:03,390
And then just the day before the fight,
he told everybody was Mac.

643
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,553
They're like,
all right man.

644
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:05,410
All right dude.
Cool.

645
00:30:05,411 --> 00:30:06,244
Whatever you want.
Do you have to ease that I bought just 

646
00:30:07,961 --> 00:30:09,940
make one a mother fucker.
Jesus Christ.

647
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:10,774
Why is everybody having,
why do we have to keep the dumb way of 

648
00:30:12,851 --> 00:30:16,660
spelling shit that our ancestors who 
came over on rafts,

649
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,840
they understand that you just can't make
some shit.

650
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:20,831
You can't?
No,

651
00:30:20,831 --> 00:30:21,790
you can't.
Well,

652
00:30:21,791 --> 00:30:24,220
you definitely to ease.
Is he all right?

653
00:30:24,221 --> 00:30:25,990
It's not.
It's just not.

654
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:28,180
It's just not.
We got rules.

655
00:30:28,181 --> 00:30:29,680
Motherfucker rules.
Okay.

656
00:30:29,681 --> 00:30:34,150
We got rules for sounds rules man.
I remember Roy being so pissed when he's

657
00:30:34,151 --> 00:30:35,710
fighting kimball,
he want him to cut his beard.

658
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,600
He's like,
get the new advantage.

659
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:39,880
What if we get ahold of his neck?
The commission was like,

660
00:30:39,881 --> 00:30:40,714
well I don't,
it's Kimbo slice when I kinda this 

661
00:30:41,861 --> 00:30:43,600
fucking beard.
What do you want us to do man?

662
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:48,190
So sad.
I know the personality wars,

663
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:50,980
you know,
personality wars versus a,

664
00:30:50,981 --> 00:30:54,130
I mean look,
he is Kimbo slice not beard is huge.

665
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,173
You know the idea originally was that 
some hundred the beard protected you 

666
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:00,123
this ridiculous.
That doesn't make any sense unless you 

667
00:31:02,081 --> 00:31:07,081
have like some crazy Rastafari and wow 
fucking dreadlocked out beard.

668
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,700
Like if you could have like a thick 
roped up,

669
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:10,970
dragged,
locked out beard,

670
00:31:10,971 --> 00:31:12,130
Caribbean Shit.
Yeah.

671
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,470
I think then you can make the argument,
but who,

672
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:15,403
what,
what kind of a human is capable of 

673
00:31:16,271 --> 00:31:19,090
growing the same kind of facial hair 
that you grow on your head.

674
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,190
Does anybody ever grown?
Jamie looked this up.

675
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,053
Tapes.
Anybody ever grown like a legit tait 

676
00:31:24,041 --> 00:31:24,671
fletcher?
A little bit.

677
00:31:24,671 --> 00:31:25,504
Right,
but he needs to like roll that shit up 

678
00:31:27,161 --> 00:31:29,530
and braid it.
He does now take those.

679
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,393
Yeah,
braids it sometimes he's like that 

680
00:31:32,471 --> 00:31:35,920
refereed to as that really long.
Oh that's true.

681
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:39,000
Just the referee the other night during 
a Mike Beltrani Mike,

682
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:40,510
he's awesome.
Yeah.

683
00:31:40,511 --> 00:31:41,400
Mike has,
that's right.

684
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:46,800
Mike has like ponytails cause he has 
picked face face pigtails.

685
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,410
Mike's a cool guy.
He's great guy.

686
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:53,950
Very good referee to one of the coolest 
guys I know.

687
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,540
Super,
super good dude.

688
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:58,660
Super good dude.
And he pulls out mustache off being that

689
00:31:58,661 --> 00:32:00,640
cool.
He's the only one.

690
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:03,903
Everybody started growing that much cash
flow going to be like slow the fuck 

691
00:32:06,521 --> 00:32:09,250
down.
Stood his background.

692
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:11,470
It would make sense.
He's a good dude man.

693
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,113
No fee fund mma they lost and they can 
cut it because you could use that to 

694
00:32:16,571 --> 00:32:17,950
choke him.
Uh,

695
00:32:17,951 --> 00:32:18,790
yeah,
I guess you could.

696
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:20,080
Yeah.
Or he can choke you with it.

697
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,870
You know,
if he gets on top of you get to Zeke eal

698
00:32:22,871 --> 00:32:24,370
with that.
Go ahead and quiz up Brown.

699
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:25,493
Yeah,
yeah,

700
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,620
yeah.
So I wonder how he rolls that.

701
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:28,330
He do,
you know,

702
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:31,300
does he rolled that up?
He's a brown belt and he's huge.

703
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:36,300
[inaudible] sec guys.
Big fucking deal.

704
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:38,200
He's not five,
nine,

705
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:40,880
no giant dude sons.
Even bigger.

706
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:41,770
Does he put it in like,
um,

707
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:44,470
like a chin been like a man bun thing?
You'd have to ask,

708
00:32:44,471 --> 00:32:46,610
you'd have to put like a thing over it.
Yeah,

709
00:32:46,611 --> 00:32:49,430
maybe in underneath the chin,
but then again that would kind of get in

710
00:32:49,431 --> 00:32:53,060
the way.
I would imagine the braids like could be

711
00:32:53,061 --> 00:32:57,380
avoided just like other kinds of braids 
and there's Rondo biting his braids.

712
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,230
Well that was actually,
it looks like.

713
00:33:00,231 --> 00:33:00,831
Okay.
Yeah.

714
00:33:00,831 --> 00:33:01,664
So he just sorta ties at the bottom of 
it and like little rubber bands and 

715
00:33:04,011 --> 00:33:05,570
shit.
Great referee.

716
00:33:05,571 --> 00:33:07,970
That guy's on top of his shit.
Does a lot of good ones,

717
00:33:07,971 --> 00:33:10,100
man.
This is a good time for MMA.

718
00:33:10,101 --> 00:33:13,070
There's a lot of like super experienced 
guys that are just,

719
00:33:13,071 --> 00:33:15,170
uh,
it's so important when you're watching a

720
00:33:15,171 --> 00:33:16,004
fight,
when you think like a fight could be 

721
00:33:17,331 --> 00:33:18,980
stopped and then,
you know,

722
00:33:18,981 --> 00:33:20,150
and then the guy gets through it.

723
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:22,250
Fighters Millet too.
When you're in the back luck,

724
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:23,120
I mean they go,
Hey,

725
00:33:23,121 --> 00:33:25,820
I'm be a ref tonight.
There are certain guys you buy shit.

726
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:30,740
I like who refereed a wonderboy and um,
tyron,

727
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:31,813
herb dean,
right.

728
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:35,180
What a great job or mccarthy.
Pretty sure it's herb though.

729
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:37,850
Those guys didn't on get out of credit,
you know?

730
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,410
Yeah.
They know the fighters,

731
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:40,663
you know,
and they know that w how tough these 

732
00:33:42,021 --> 00:33:44,370
guys are in the can be in those spots 
everywhere.

733
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:47,060
Everyone's got the classic fuckups as a 
referee.

734
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:49,280
I don't remember any by big John 
McCarthy.

735
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:53,360
You don't remember Marilla Bustamante 
tapping out Matt Lindland twice.

736
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,530
Oh,
that's right,

737
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,340
that's right.
Morale booster.

738
00:33:57,020 --> 00:34:01,340
Madelyn in an arm bar tabs.
He let go and he said I didn't tap.

739
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:04,160
And then marilla got him again the next 
round with a good team.

740
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:05,263
That wasn't a fuck up.
That was like the dude ghost tapped or 

741
00:34:07,941 --> 00:34:08,300
something.

742
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,730
You know,
he lied,

743
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,880
tapped and he said you didn't tap.
Yeah,

744
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,340
but that's not that big fight is a 
championship fight.

745
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:18,020
But,
but looking back,

746
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:19,870
thank God.
Oh standardly Yada.

747
00:34:19,871 --> 00:34:21,530
Denmark.
Leon's a great job in that fight.

748
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:23,660
Great job.
Great job in that fight.

749
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:25,420
Yeah.
Yeah.

750
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:26,480
He's great.
He's great to,

751
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:29,720
Dan's a really good guy too.
And fucking giant.

752
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:31,010
He's,
he's a gorilla.

753
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,380
Stir guy.
Gives me a hug.

754
00:34:32,381 --> 00:34:33,560
I'm,
I feel like he's my daddy.

755
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:38,620
Me To sit on the fucking lap.
But another really good referee,

756
00:34:39,741 --> 00:34:40,430
you know,
who's another real,

757
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:42,050
real good referee that,
uh,

758
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,850
Josh Rosenthal,
very good.

759
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,370
Hellier I hope.
Prison.

760
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:46,640
Yeah.
Yeah,

761
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:47,473
yeah.
He's out.

762
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,860
He's out.
He was awesome.

763
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:49,723
Very good referee.
He got caught up in some sort of pot 

764
00:34:51,321 --> 00:34:54,800
thing like plants and shit on his house.
Not good,

765
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,740
whatever.
But he's out now and he,

766
00:34:56,810 --> 00:34:59,030
I guess he's refereeing again for other 
organizations,

767
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:00,050
but he was very good.

768
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:03,230
I don't remember him ever fucking up and
really smart guy.

769
00:35:03,231 --> 00:35:05,840
When he comes to mma,
knows a lot of his Jujitsu brown belt,

770
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,380
I think under a,
who's the under the,

771
00:35:08,381 --> 00:35:10,100
under Cesar Gracie?
I think so.

772
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:12,050
I think so.
But he's a legit,

773
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:15,043
one of the important,
they train like Mccarthy's rolling all 

774
00:35:16,611 --> 00:35:18,920
the time so they know what positions to 
look for.

775
00:35:18,921 --> 00:35:19,754
Transitions.
It's kind of funny how those northern 

776
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:25,010
California guys are known as like real 
hard style Jujitsu guys.

777
00:35:25,011 --> 00:35:25,844
Like how Caesar and you know when you,
when you start talking about like those 

778
00:35:29,181 --> 00:35:30,014
northern California Jujitsu schools,
how fun is always had a reputation of 

779
00:35:33,801 --> 00:35:37,890
like if you go like a of frowning upon 
tapping,

780
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,760
you tapped in front of house.
That was the story.

781
00:35:41,761 --> 00:35:43,620
It can be totally blown out of 
proportion,

782
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:45,670
but US training down,
um,

783
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,490
with Jacques,
we heard,

784
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,590
we heard the crazy stories about how if 
that,

785
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:54,990
that he looked down on tapping like you 
gotta you gotta escape.

786
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:56,690
Don't tap.
How about Dave [inaudible],

787
00:35:56,700 --> 00:36:01,080
he's another one other than my mother 
fucker from the north of California.

788
00:36:01,081 --> 00:36:01,914
There's like that heart.
He came from that same camp that 

789
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:06,060
hardstyle.
It could be a total myth though.

790
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:06,601
You know what?
I mean,

791
00:36:06,601 --> 00:36:08,210
that's what we thought that we thought,
man,

792
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:11,610
those guys are so tough,
but don't you break my heart?

793
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,350
Don't like people have like a feel to 
them.

794
00:36:13,351 --> 00:36:14,041
Like you hear like,
Oh,

795
00:36:14,041 --> 00:36:15,440
this guy's a half black buddy.
Go,

796
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:16,560
Ooh.
Like that's,

797
00:36:16,561 --> 00:36:17,394
that's,
that's uh,

798
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:19,140
like one of those black bolts we'd go 
over.

799
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:21,630
It was guys probably a psap beyond my 
shit.

800
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:24,030
Yeah.
He's a black belt is like,

801
00:36:24,031 --> 00:36:26,490
these are super aggressive style,
right?

802
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:30,480
Dave Camereo,
Dan Camereo,

803
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:33,240
like when you hear Hickson here,
if someone's a hixon black belt,

804
00:36:33,241 --> 00:36:34,074
you go,
Ooh,

805
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:35,340
hundred percent.
Whoa,

806
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:38,300
okay on this guy's legit as fuck.
You know,

807
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:41,220
100% legit it,
there's no sh there's no,

808
00:36:41,221 --> 00:36:43,900
like,
she hits it,

809
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:45,560
especially when they're hixon black 
belts.

810
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:47,670
They're really game too.
Oh yeah.

811
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:50,730
Like at the Gracie Academy of the,
a lot of Hixon guys go up there.

812
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:52,650
I mean,
they are game,

813
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:58,550
the chrome chrome's kicks and he said 
he's a cut above the elite.

814
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:00,623
Like Hixon is,
everyone says when they rolled hixon or 

815
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:04,123
you know,
back in the day that they were just 

816
00:37:05,971 --> 00:37:10,050
completely immobilized and dismantle,
everyone has their hixon story.

817
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:12,060
And you look at chrome,
chrome,

818
00:37:12,061 --> 00:37:16,650
very few Jujitsu players like crone.
Crone got a serious full guard,

819
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:20,100
serious guilt guillotine and his full 
guard attacks.

820
00:37:20,101 --> 00:37:20,934
You don't see that that much in 
grappling and the more someone with a 

821
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:26,340
full guard that's dangerous.
Crohn's got that Crohn's,

822
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:29,700
Crohn's or a little bit different than 
your average elite.

823
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:31,820
You should see his workouts.
When I was doing a,

824
00:37:31,821 --> 00:37:32,654
a grappling competition chromos on at 
two so I trained with him for like a 

825
00:37:35,791 --> 00:37:37,860
week at a school in Culver City there.

826
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,020
Dude,
they would do these two,

827
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:42,510
two and a half hour workouts.
His Cardio was insane.

828
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:45,870
What kind of shit was he doing?
He would do this crazy warm up,

829
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:49,110
crazy warm up and we go over position,
position,

830
00:37:49,111 --> 00:37:52,050
position and then it was like a king of 
the hill.

831
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:56,070
We'd match up and however long it took 
until someone got submitted,

832
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:57,143
then the two guys would be at the end.
Then the rest of the map with stare and 

833
00:38:00,121 --> 00:38:02,640
watch those two guys at the end.
Jesus Christ.

834
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:05,520
It was intense.
Super intense.

835
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:07,463
Wow.
And he does a lot of like nutty 

836
00:38:09,121 --> 00:38:09,954
gymnastic shit too.
Does that he does the breathing thing 

837
00:38:11,581 --> 00:38:12,414
like his dad and at the end,
crone and I were going against each 

838
00:38:15,991 --> 00:38:19,800
other probably 15,
20 minutes straight.

839
00:38:19,801 --> 00:38:21,840
And they caught me an armbar.
Wow.

840
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:23,760
He's a,
he's not,

841
00:38:23,761 --> 00:38:26,900
he's tiny,
tiny.

842
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:29,040
He says what's wrong with all monsters?

843
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,173
And then with my big ass,
it was just arm bar and he's always 

844
00:38:32,611 --> 00:38:33,444
training with nick and nate and he's 
training with animals for for a while 

845
00:38:36,851 --> 00:38:38,260
now.
It's been a while.

846
00:38:38,261 --> 00:38:41,380
It's been a month and it's looking like 
a strike is coming together.

847
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,160
Yeah.
He's looking,

848
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,660
he's a special dude.
Yeah.

849
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:46,000
Very,
very special dude in special genes.

850
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:47,380
Their son,
special jeans.

851
00:38:47,381 --> 00:38:48,214
Handsome Fella.
Handsome little fellas structure with 

852
00:38:49,811 --> 00:38:50,990
off space.
Yes.

853
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:52,180
Just like it's poplar,
right?

854
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:52,930
Yeah.
Uh,

855
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:55,300
but also he's just a good dude to be 
around.

856
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:56,163
Yeah.
Like you feel like you're around a 

857
00:38:56,531 --> 00:38:58,390
Samurai.
Very good dude.

858
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,800
Yeah.
Well he's legit as fuck,

859
00:38:59,801 --> 00:39:00,850
man.
I mean,

860
00:39:00,851 --> 00:39:01,684
it's a,
he's the rare exception to show me the 

861
00:39:02,921 --> 00:39:05,080
man,
the son of a great man.

862
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:07,840
Great man.
He's the rare exception.

863
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:10,510
He has the mentality because you look at
guys like,

864
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:12,520
uh,
who though Chavez Jr.

865
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:15,340
You look at these guys who come from 
that kind of pedigree,

866
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:16,690
it usually doesn't correlate.

867
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:17,613
Yeah,
they're usually like kind of soft or 

868
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:23,110
they're missing a few things there.
The discipline was not just not there.

869
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:25,450
It just didn't quite have the same 
discipline as his dad,

870
00:39:25,451 --> 00:39:27,430
but he was still talented.
Like to party though,

871
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:31,330
don't you?
Not like that.

872
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:35,170
I think our parking's yeah,
for sure man.

873
00:39:35,171 --> 00:39:37,360
For sure.
Because I'm that Jon Jones party,

874
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:40,890
there's partying and then there's John 
Jones bar.

875
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:41,891
Well,
you know,

876
00:39:41,891 --> 00:39:44,500
he's the son of like one of the 
greatest,

877
00:39:44,501 --> 00:39:47,290
if not the greatest with Mexican boxing 
champion of all time.

878
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:51,340
Julio Cesar Chavez is a legend.
When he fought Meldrick Taylor,

879
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:52,723
remember that fight man?
Meldrick Taylor was lightning limpic 

880
00:39:55,211 --> 00:39:58,750
gold medalist during the heyday,
the mark Braelin heyday.

881
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,900
Remember those guys to that whole crew 
of Olympic gold medals.

882
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:05,400
Pernell whitaker and Meldrick Taylor was
just lightning.

883
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:09,490
So just hit dude.
These ridiculous combinations.

884
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:10,483
Chavez just kept slugging away bobbing 
and weaving and rip it to the body and 

885
00:40:14,381 --> 00:40:15,230
slugging away.

886
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:17,140
Cause you ever see his fights outdoor 
and Mexico?

887
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:18,490
Yeah,
I've seen most of them.

888
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:19,323
They're just like,
it's like a fucking call a [inaudible] 

889
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:26,460
Algun o in Mexico,
but back to the Meldrick Taylor fight.

890
00:40:26,561 --> 00:40:27,820
Let me,
this is what I remember.

891
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:31,840
This is what I remember.
Controversy in the first fight.

892
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:33,970
The end of the round,
it looks,

893
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,980
it looks like Meldrick Taylor was 
winning.

894
00:40:35,981 --> 00:40:36,814
He was,
he was stealing the fight and then at 

895
00:40:38,201 --> 00:40:41,410
the end Chavez last round was fucking 
him up,

896
00:40:41,411 --> 00:40:43,880
had him against the ropes and the ref 
stopped it.

897
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:46,420
But that was only like two seconds left.
Richard Steele,

898
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:47,650
right?
Did it go down like that?

899
00:40:47,651 --> 00:40:48,251
Yup.
Yup.

900
00:40:48,251 --> 00:40:49,084
Two seconds left to the 12th round and 
he stopped the fight and he stopped the 

901
00:40:51,881 --> 00:40:52,714
fight because Malik went down hard and 
he got up and he was fucking out of it 

902
00:40:56,351 --> 00:40:58,690
and still looked in his eyes and he 
waved him off.

903
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:00,310
He said he would do it again too.
He said,

904
00:41:00,311 --> 00:41:02,170
it doesn't matter if it's only two 
seconds off in the fight.

905
00:41:02,171 --> 00:41:03,004
He goes,
I know this guy is not fit to fight 

906
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:05,410
anymore.
He was like,

907
00:41:05,411 --> 00:41:07,720
he got stopped.
He got him up.

908
00:41:07,721 --> 00:41:08,554
He looked at his eyes and Mel Giotto was
looking at him and he asked him some 

909
00:41:10,631 --> 00:41:12,640
questions and Taylor wasn't answering 
him and he's like,

910
00:41:12,641 --> 00:41:13,474
fuck this.
A lot of that in box elder cause beaten 

911
00:41:14,951 --> 00:41:17,110
him the whole fight,
but in his credit,

912
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:20,230
Richard steals credit.
Myalgic tail was never the same again.

913
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:22,780
Never the same after that fight.
He was right.

914
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:23,763
He was done.
He just was right in front of him 

915
00:41:25,631 --> 00:41:27,130
touching him,
looking him in the eye.

916
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,400
Let's see it.
This is Cesar Chavez,

917
00:41:30,401 --> 00:41:31,234
Kaos Meldrick Taylor and this was a 
fight where meldrick speed and footwork 

918
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:36,710
who he was just,
he was ahead.

919
00:41:36,711 --> 00:41:37,630
It was a head on the scorecard.

920
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:38,493
He was getting the better of him in the 
beginning of the fight that that ref 

921
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:41,810
stop not fight in your hair.
Freddie Roach talked about,

922
00:41:41,811 --> 00:41:42,644
he goes,
I wish my corner would have tossed in 

923
00:41:43,491 --> 00:41:44,324
the towel or the referee would have 
jumped in way sooner and a lot of my 

924
00:41:47,181 --> 00:41:47,841
fights.
Yeah,

925
00:41:47,841 --> 00:41:48,970
well for,
it's very loud.

926
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:51,680
He took a lot of punishment,
but if you asked him back then,

927
00:41:51,681 --> 00:41:53,380
if they,
he wanted them to stop the fight,

928
00:41:53,381 --> 00:41:54,214
he might've said,
no.

929
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:56,360
Look how good Chavez was.
Mike God,

930
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:59,570
he was so good with his angles.
He was our hero did.

931
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:00,820
He was so good.
Sorry.

932
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:01,733
Here.
How's the greatest Mexican boxer of all 

933
00:42:02,901 --> 00:42:03,734
time?
For sure.

934
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:04,603
Right.
It was better than now where you could 

935
00:42:05,241 --> 00:42:06,074
learn so much watching his test.
The greatest thing he throws in the 

936
00:42:09,831 --> 00:42:12,020
thing he throws,
he's like short and perfect.

937
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:13,490
That was our chuck Norris.

938
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:16,880
It was a bad,
how to fuck comparing Chuck Norris.

939
00:42:16,881 --> 00:42:17,714
She was a bad motherfucker.
I was a huge Chavez fan when he fought 

940
00:42:21,441 --> 00:42:23,360
Greg Haugen.
He was the guy that said,

941
00:42:23,361 --> 00:42:23,931
uh,
yeah,

942
00:42:23,931 --> 00:42:24,950
he has got a,
cause.

943
00:42:24,951 --> 00:42:29,951
He was like a g tech drive is all his 
opponents were taxi cab drivers.

944
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:32,690
That's right.
His son has skills.

945
00:42:32,691 --> 00:42:35,390
He just doesn't have that it factor.
He's just not this guy.

946
00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:37,090
This guy's a different guy.
This guy,

947
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:40,010
the first of all,
his son is a winger bombs,

948
00:42:40,011 --> 00:42:40,770
you know,
and he's a,

949
00:42:40,770 --> 00:42:43,510
he's a hard striker.
His son can fucking caissons.

950
00:42:43,850 --> 00:42:45,080
No doubt.
He's a big boy.

951
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:48,350
He's a Chavez,
was a different kind of fighter.

952
00:42:48,351 --> 00:42:49,184
He was a much more volume fighter and 
would throw perfect technique punches 

953
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:54,223
and would never run out of fucking gas.
Saint Lucie on you for 12 rounds 

954
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:03,170
throwing bombs on you and just never 
letting up talking about it.

955
00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:05,450
Have you seen his interviews?
Now?

956
00:43:05,451 --> 00:43:06,860
He's fine.
Pretty legit.

957
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:08,210
Well,
I don't speak Spanish.

958
00:43:08,211 --> 00:43:09,390
There it is.
You heard some here.

959
00:43:09,391 --> 00:43:10,310
It's with that right.
Look at it.

960
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:12,020
Take to the body.
Look at that left Hook,

961
00:43:12,021 --> 00:43:12,920
man.
Come on,

962
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:13,813
let's get turn.
And he turns him around and with that 

963
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:17,420
right hand,
perfect right hand.

964
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:18,583
God,
look Meldrick Taylor's down and the 

965
00:43:20,331 --> 00:43:22,520
referees counting him.
He's eight,

966
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,290
seven,
six,

967
00:43:24,770 --> 00:43:25,970
five,
four.

968
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,410
These are you okay?
You okay?

969
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,570
And he has no idea where he is.
He won't respond.

970
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:33,050
Mel Gto doesn't know where he is.
So Richard's still stops the fight.

971
00:43:33,051 --> 00:43:34,640
That is a correct call.
Great job.

972
00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:36,030
We got mad.
You're crazy.

973
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:37,423
They're crazy.
Cause they thought he was gonna win the 

974
00:43:38,211 --> 00:43:39,500
fight.
That fight was over,

975
00:43:39,501 --> 00:43:41,000
man.
If they let him hit him again,

976
00:43:41,001 --> 00:43:43,400
he might've died,
obviously not make me.

977
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:44,900
You never know.
It'd be,

978
00:43:44,901 --> 00:43:47,390
I shouldn't have said that,
but you know what I'm saying?

979
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:49,040
Like that's,
that's what that comes from.

980
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:50,383
It comes from when a guy's done.
There's a boss who just died not just a 

981
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:55,580
few months ago in Australia,
professional boxer.

982
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:58,430
I like the fact that they're trying to,
like,

983
00:43:58,431 --> 00:43:59,264
if you listen to hbo commentary,
like guys will be like hanging in there 

984
00:44:01,701 --> 00:44:02,534
in the fight and you'll heal.
Max Kellerman say they could very 

985
00:44:04,941 --> 00:44:06,830
reasonably make the case for stopping 
this fight.

986
00:44:07,070 --> 00:44:08,090
And I'm like,
thank you.

987
00:44:08,091 --> 00:44:08,790
I know,
right?

988
00:44:08,790 --> 00:44:11,330
Thanks.
Before you can never ever heard that.

989
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:13,490
I've never heard that.
Even the NFL,

990
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:14,930
there's the guy who got rocked Dick,
man,

991
00:44:14,931 --> 00:44:15,764
I hope he doesn't come back.
Hope he's all right to put them in the 

992
00:44:17,061 --> 00:44:20,660
concussion protocol.
Who was that dude that just quit on a,

993
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:23,410
did he quit on Golovkin?
No.

994
00:44:23,411 --> 00:44:24,470
Lowman Chanko no,
no,

995
00:44:24,471 --> 00:44:25,304
no.
Uh,

996
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:26,890
check again.
Sergei Luma Chang.

997
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:27,733
He was even really getting rocked out.
Like he was just out class and he's 

998
00:44:29,571 --> 00:44:30,440
like,
fuck this.

999
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:31,273
I'm not winning.
I,

1000
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:33,630
whatever you wrote him on defeated.
I'm just fucking done.

1001
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:36,090
You're talking about homeboy,
Kell Brook.

1002
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:38,280
Yes.
He was getting,

1003
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:40,780
he was getting,
couldn't see out of his eye and his corn

1004
00:44:40,781 --> 00:44:41,614
was like,
no,

1005
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:43,080
we was fine.
Golovkin yes,

1006
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:43,980
yeah,
yeah.

1007
00:44:43,981 --> 00:44:45,300
But to fight,
well,

1008
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:46,720
the Kell Brook fight,
um,

1009
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:47,573
was a little bit controversial.
The Loma Chanko fight was much more 

1010
00:44:50,461 --> 00:44:51,271
controversial,
right.

1011
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:52,980
Where most people were like,
this is ridiculous.

1012
00:44:53,010 --> 00:44:54,530
Yeah.
Because he really was thinking,

1013
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:55,830
yeah,
neglect.

1014
00:44:55,830 --> 00:44:56,663
He just quit.
And Nicholas Walters was undefeated 

1015
00:44:58,020 --> 00:44:59,130
before this,
but he had,

1016
00:44:59,160 --> 00:44:59,993
he had taken some time off apparently.
And that was supposed to be like a big 

1017
00:45:02,191 --> 00:45:04,950
test for limit Chenko and then even Max 
Kellerman,

1018
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:07,320
he goes in the ring and he goes,
you know,

1019
00:45:07,321 --> 00:45:09,600
just,
just as a box in kind of sore,

1020
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:13,110
usually go out on your shield,
like you really weren't getting hit.

1021
00:45:13,111 --> 00:45:14,430
And he goes,
no,

1022
00:45:14,431 --> 00:45:15,264
there was a,
there's a left hand in that and that 

1023
00:45:16,591 --> 00:45:17,210
wobbled me.

1024
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:17,671
And he's like,
well,

1025
00:45:17,671 --> 00:45:18,610
we can't,
like,

1026
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:21,060
can you give us the time round anything?
He's like,

1027
00:45:21,061 --> 00:45:21,591
no,
but I,

1028
00:45:21,591 --> 00:45:22,321
I was hurt,
man.

1029
00:45:22,321 --> 00:45:24,270
That's why I stopped.
And even,

1030
00:45:24,271 --> 00:45:25,104
you know,
Mac telling me see how many boxes of 

1031
00:45:25,861 --> 00:45:26,694
matches,
it's like he's the fucking Joe Rogan of 

1032
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:29,610
box.
And he was like,

1033
00:45:29,850 --> 00:45:30,631
dude,
like this,

1034
00:45:30,631 --> 00:45:33,870
this is going to hurt your career man.
So they're saying all those years he put

1035
00:45:33,871 --> 00:45:34,704
into finally establish himself and get 
this fight and then you quit and then 

1036
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:41,580
there's really no damage.
He just,

1037
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:44,630
it was like mighty mouse just all 
around.

1038
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:46,320
He didn't know what to do.
He had no answer and just like,

1039
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:48,600
I can't fucking,
I'm just going to get embarrassed.

1040
00:45:48,601 --> 00:45:50,400
I think he was getting hit a little bit 
more than that.

1041
00:45:50,430 --> 00:45:51,263
I agree with you.
But I think Loma Chanko was really 

1042
00:45:52,441 --> 00:45:53,390
laying into him.
Was it?

1043
00:45:53,391 --> 00:45:54,224
Well what Brown did they stop at seven 
seventh round to fight the round before 

1044
00:45:57,301 --> 00:45:57,810
that.

1045
00:45:57,810 --> 00:45:59,820
So it was at the end of the seventh how 
does that work?

1046
00:45:59,821 --> 00:46:02,310
Or is it the beginning of the seventh he
doesn't come out to his corner.

1047
00:46:02,311 --> 00:46:03,960
So it a 77 answer the bell,
right?

1048
00:46:03,961 --> 00:46:04,794
For the seventh so it was the six round 
Loma Chanko was just putting it to a 

1049
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:08,553
man.
It was just really getting on him and I 

1050
00:46:10,381 --> 00:46:11,760
think he,
he saw the end,

1051
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:12,600
I was like,
dude,

1052
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,190
he's like,
I can't even hit this guy.

1053
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:15,720
I didn't have a problem with it.
I was like,

1054
00:46:15,721 --> 00:46:16,554
yeah,
you're definitely never beating him as 

1055
00:46:17,611 --> 00:46:18,630
a,
as a fighter.

1056
00:46:18,631 --> 00:46:21,030
And most other other fighters will go,
fuck that guy.

1057
00:46:21,031 --> 00:46:23,370
Didn't have a fighter's heart that he 
shouldn't be in there.

1058
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:24,630
Yeah.
I think,

1059
00:46:24,690 --> 00:46:27,780
I think both arguments could be made.
I agree.

1060
00:46:28,110 --> 00:46:28,943
But I think,
uh,

1061
00:46:28,970 --> 00:46:31,650
I would lean more towards yours because 
like you never know.

1062
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:32,101
Like,
look,

1063
00:46:32,101 --> 00:46:32,934
Chavez is getting outclassed earlier in 
that fight with Meldrick Taylor and he 

1064
00:46:35,641 --> 00:46:36,300
never gave up.

1065
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:37,133
He kept chipping away and people will 
define you based on how quickly you're 

1066
00:46:40,861 --> 00:46:44,310
willing to give up.
But I think the skill level,

1067
00:46:44,390 --> 00:46:45,900
you know,
do you know who learned lemme?

1068
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:50,070
Chenko is dude is from outer space.
He's an alien.

1069
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:52,830
He's a bad rush.
Motherfucker.

1070
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:55,850
Russia,
he says he should fight Russia.

1071
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:57,960
Oh wait.
Triple H.

1072
00:46:58,040 --> 00:46:58,261
No,
no,

1073
00:46:58,261 --> 00:46:59,094
no.
You can thinking triple g trying to go 

1074
00:46:59,790 --> 00:47:00,623
off.
Oh,

1075
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:04,290
sorry.
Lemme Chanko is actually maybe more,

1076
00:47:04,291 --> 00:47:06,540
it's more technical.
It's more skilled for sure.

1077
00:47:06,541 --> 00:47:09,540
Pull up Aloma Chanko a highlights,
but joe,

1078
00:47:09,541 --> 00:47:10,750
to your sale low,
but chain,

1079
00:47:10,751 --> 00:47:11,584
to your point,
most skilled boxer in the world does no 

1080
00:47:13,531 --> 00:47:16,440
publicity.
This is the video viewers.

1081
00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:18,870
Well,
he's 125 pounds like you were saying,

1082
00:47:19,730 --> 00:47:21,120
but look at this.
Look at these fucking,

1083
00:47:21,150 --> 00:47:24,380
the footwork on this tickles.
His angles are so filthy,

1084
00:47:24,390 --> 00:47:28,830
so hard for people to hit him clean.
He's just just so technical.

1085
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:30,310
Like he just pushes

1086
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:31,960
dudes around looking.
I mean he's,

1087
00:47:31,961 --> 00:47:33,820
he's laying it to this dude.
And you're ready for this.

1088
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:34,993
Seven.
Five,

1089
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:36,730
yes.
Seven fights.

1090
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:39,370
Seven pro fights.
It just has so many amateur b,

1091
00:47:39,371 --> 00:47:40,390
six in one,
but wall.

1092
00:47:40,391 --> 00:47:42,220
Look,
walters hit him a couple of times there.

1093
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:43,083
I see.
That's where I could see your argument 

1094
00:47:44,471 --> 00:47:45,330
much more.
I mean,

1095
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:48,160
it's not like walters didn't 
occasionally connect.

1096
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:49,053
It's just for sure.
Loma Chanko is connecting more than him 

1097
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:54,780
walks up to him to make a decision to 
just opt out to look at that.

1098
00:47:55,170 --> 00:47:56,020
Come on,
man.

1099
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:58,000
This,
you can't say he's not getting hit.

1100
00:47:58,030 --> 00:47:59,560
He's getting fucking hit.
Right.

1101
00:47:59,561 --> 00:48:01,120
Right there.
He got hurt right there.

1102
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:05,320
He's holding onto the glove.
Lemme Chanko is all over him here,

1103
00:48:05,321 --> 00:48:08,080
man.
I mean it makes sense.

1104
00:48:08,081 --> 00:48:10,330
He was a medal winner.
He sees the end man.

1105
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:12,300
He's gold medal winner twice.
Yes.

1106
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:13,780
Two Separate Olympics,
right?

1107
00:48:13,870 --> 00:48:15,130
Yup.
He sees the end.

1108
00:48:15,131 --> 00:48:16,990
What do you mean he's cute?
Keeps getting fucked up.

1109
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,250
That's why Walter is quit.
You know his corn.

1110
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:20,470
Look at them in there in the corner.
Dude,

1111
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:21,453
he's fucked up.
He's fucked that he's also broke 

1112
00:48:23,051 --> 00:48:23,980
mentally too.
He's like,

1113
00:48:23,981 --> 00:48:25,780
I'm not,
I can't compete with this guy.

1114
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:27,280
Yeah,
and I just,

1115
00:48:27,790 --> 00:48:31,120
I see everybody's point,
but I see,

1116
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:33,340
I see his point too.
At the end he looked like he was getting

1117
00:48:33,341 --> 00:48:34,174
fucked.
I wish you could've gotten into a 

1118
00:48:34,831 --> 00:48:37,540
frickin Bernard Hopkins.
There was last week.

1119
00:48:37,570 --> 00:48:42,170
We haven't talked about that right out 
of the hat.

1120
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:43,083
Oh yeah.
You're a hall of fame at 51 check this 

1121
00:48:44,621 --> 00:48:46,500
out out of the F.
Have you seen this?

1122
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:48,940
Here's one thing I haven't seen out of 
the ring.

1123
00:48:48,970 --> 00:48:53,950
Boxing needs boxing me to do something 
boxing needs and do something about that

1124
00:48:53,951 --> 00:48:57,010
ring thing that's not,
that should never be able to happen.

1125
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:59,740
Where a guy can fall through the rings,
the ropes,

1126
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:00,633
and here you're talking about a guy 
who's been fighting for 23 something 

1127
00:49:02,921 --> 00:49:03,754
years.
How long has hopkins been fighting and 

1128
00:49:04,721 --> 00:49:07,630
he can still fall through the ropes like
you shouldn't have ropes.

1129
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:09,850
You should have some sort of a mesh 
inside the ropes.

1130
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,730
This is Joe Smith.
Jr is ropes are now loose.

1131
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:15,250
Bernard Hopkins who falls through the 
ropes,

1132
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,330
ropes,
ropes,

1133
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:20,290
Jesus Christ and lands on his fucking 
head and Smith is a bad motherfucker.

1134
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:21,070
Dude.
This is a goal.

1135
00:49:21,070 --> 00:49:25,530
This was a dangerous fight.
Smith also has arms that look like a,

1136
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,310
like a popeye.
Bad Guy,

1137
00:49:27,311 --> 00:49:29,430
arms heavyweight.
They're like too long.

1138
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:32,140
No long arms are like too long for his 
body.

1139
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:36,610
Get him here dude.
He Fuck Bernard Hopkins Up.

1140
00:49:37,450 --> 00:49:38,283
It was rough like this.
Look at it and be fall time and do 

1141
00:49:40,421 --> 00:49:41,254
something.
And that was the end of the fire right 

1142
00:49:42,161 --> 00:49:42,330
there.

1143
00:49:42,330 --> 00:49:42,571
Yeah,
yeah,

1144
00:49:42,571 --> 00:49:43,960
yeah.
He fell on his fucking head.

1145
00:49:43,961 --> 00:49:45,610
This is the worst part.
Bernard kept going.

1146
00:49:45,611 --> 00:49:48,040
He pushed me out the ring and they 
showed the replay.

1147
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:49,900
Then that Max in the locker room.
He goes,

1148
00:49:49,901 --> 00:49:51,400
what do you think happened was I got 
pushed.

1149
00:49:51,401 --> 00:49:54,070
Man's do little shit.
He just landed on his fucking head.

1150
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:55,930
That is a real clown.
Right?

1151
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:57,160
But no,
it's a real fight.

1152
00:49:57,220 --> 00:50:00,070
He was just,
Smith was winning.

1153
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:02,170
No,
Joe Smith was winning the fight up until

1154
00:50:02,171 --> 00:50:03,004
that moment.
And then he knocked him through the 

1155
00:50:04,121 --> 00:50:06,460
ropes with an Abrie much.
I don't know,

1156
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:07,031
man.
I don't think,

1157
00:50:07,031 --> 00:50:09,070
I think Hopkins has done cause that's 
dangerous.

1158
00:50:09,071 --> 00:50:12,610
The way felt like that she fell and 
landed on his fucking head man.

1159
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:13,970
And no wonder why he's,
he's,

1160
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:17,290
you can't hold him accountable for 
anything he's saying right now.

1161
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:18,153
That guy clearly landed on his fucking 
head after taking some really solid 

1162
00:50:22,451 --> 00:50:24,070
shots.
You guys know the rule on that.

1163
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:25,900
If he get knocked out of the ring?
No.

1164
00:50:25,950 --> 00:50:26,960
22nd,
22nd.

1165
00:50:27,010 --> 00:50:28,130
Yeah.
To jump back

1166
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:28,940
in.
Why,

1167
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:30,710
why did he have ropes?
Look,

1168
00:50:30,711 --> 00:50:31,544
man,
that's why don't have a mesh in between 

1169
00:50:32,901 --> 00:50:34,760
those ropes where that can't fucking 
happen.

1170
00:50:35,310 --> 00:50:37,550
But this guy never happen.
But it does happen.

1171
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:39,140
It's happened before it happened in,
um,

1172
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:40,670
uh,
what's his name?

1173
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:41,930
Uh,
Ray Mercer fight.

1174
00:50:42,230 --> 00:50:43,063
Remember when Tommy,
Tommy Morrison got tangled up in the 

1175
00:50:45,321 --> 00:50:47,230
ropes,
his arms went through the ropes.

1176
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:50,800
You guys have fallen out of the ropes 
before he's fallen out of the road.

1177
00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:54,040
This isn't the first time a huge fall.
Yeah.

1178
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:54,973
Oh yeah.
The camera man should be fired or beat 

1179
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:57,433
when he went backstage.
I think people can fall through the 

1180
00:50:59,121 --> 00:51:00,950
ropes.
It just doesn't happen that often.

1181
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:04,670
But when you get tagged like he did and 
he stepped on his foot to Yo,

1182
00:51:04,671 --> 00:51:05,260
dude,
he got,

1183
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:09,160
he was getting lit up.
Go back on a 79 just calm.

1184
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:10,100
Talk about that.
No,

1185
00:51:10,101 --> 00:51:12,710
I didn't even see it unless I'm 
retarded.

1186
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:13,853
Look,
look,

1187
00:51:14,090 --> 00:51:15,380
look at this.
Boom,

1188
00:51:15,381 --> 00:51:16,520
boom,
boom,

1189
00:51:16,521 --> 00:51:17,510
boom.
No,

1190
00:51:17,511 --> 00:51:18,950
he didn't start charging.
I'm retarded.

1191
00:51:18,951 --> 00:51:21,350
I thought he stepped on this.
It's hard to pay attention to everything

1192
00:51:21,351 --> 00:51:22,184
in there,
but that was a vicious fucking 

1193
00:51:23,091 --> 00:51:23,924
combination and the reason why he went 
through the ropes is because his legs 

1194
00:51:26,391 --> 00:51:29,450
were gone.
They gave out when his butt was down and

1195
00:51:29,451 --> 00:51:32,060
then he got clipped again and his body 
just went limp.

1196
00:51:32,061 --> 00:51:36,530
He also went through the ropes because 
that left fucking hook from Rhode Island

1197
00:51:36,531 --> 00:51:40,430
land.
It's not a pushover fascination.

1198
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:41,273
Not The way you want to go.
I'm telling you the worst part about 

1199
00:51:42,741 --> 00:51:44,750
that was him fallen on his fucking head.
None of it's,

1200
00:51:44,751 --> 00:51:47,000
that's horrible.
That's horrible.

1201
00:51:47,330 --> 00:51:48,163
How do they not have pads down there?
How do they not have some sort of a 

1202
00:51:51,710 --> 00:51:53,030
like,
you know that's possible.

1203
00:51:53,031 --> 00:51:55,040
Why?
If people fight on a platform,

1204
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:56,030
that's a bad at anything.

1205
00:51:56,510 --> 00:51:58,790
I didn't have pads down.
That's what they should do.

1206
00:51:59,030 --> 00:52:01,940
They should absolutely have like judo 
crash pads.

1207
00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:03,680
How hard would that be?
You know,

1208
00:52:03,681 --> 00:52:06,320
have that shit as a buffer in between 
the tables.

1209
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:07,213
Have everybody pushed back a little bit 
like fuck the fact that that can happen 

1210
00:52:10,641 --> 00:52:14,540
to a guy like hopkins has been fighting 
as long as he is scary,

1211
00:52:14,541 --> 00:52:15,560
right?
Yeah.

1212
00:52:15,561 --> 00:52:16,910
He asked to be done now,
man,

1213
00:52:16,911 --> 00:52:18,980
because that was his doors damage he's 
ever taken.

1214
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:19,970
Yeah.
He said he's done.

1215
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:21,710
He was thinking that he's never been 
stopped.

1216
00:52:21,810 --> 00:52:22,643
That exchange was awful.
Not just for the punches because he 

1217
00:52:24,631 --> 00:52:25,464
still takes a great fucking punch.
He might've went down from the punches 

1218
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:29,450
and got up and even survive the round.
True,

1219
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:32,180
but landed on your head like that is no 
Bueno.

1220
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:34,390
Boom.
That's scary to watch him.

1221
00:52:34,391 --> 00:52:35,840
And he got a died there for sure.

1222
00:52:36,010 --> 00:52:38,930
Damn as twice I brought that up.
So extreme punished.

1223
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:40,073
He couldn't stop being so extreme.
But it's not that you guys care deeply 

1224
00:52:45,350 --> 00:52:47,200
about fighters.
You'd love them.

1225
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:51,130
Well 51 year old fallen out of the ring 
on concrete on his head and he's like,

1226
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:53,020
God,
he's on Mount Rushmore for boxing.

1227
00:52:53,030 --> 00:52:56,510
I think you gotta give him credit for 
taking that fight because that guy,

1228
00:52:57,890 --> 00:52:59,270
he's crazy.
What the fuck?

1229
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:00,133
He thought he saw something in him that 
he might be able to exploit and he was 

1230
00:53:02,541 --> 00:53:03,374
wrong.
How much money did he get for that 

1231
00:53:04,101 --> 00:53:07,040
fight?
$7 72 like,

1232
00:53:07,070 --> 00:53:09,620
like 5 million or something like that.
I Dunno.

1233
00:53:09,730 --> 00:53:11,330
Cause you want me to a million.
1 million.

1234
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:14,780
I wonder if he has a deal with HBO.
Golden boy productions to right.

1235
00:53:14,781 --> 00:53:18,740
And he's a part of golden boy.
So he's a promoter and he got 1 million.

1236
00:53:18,890 --> 00:53:20,460
It's worth though.
He may falls.

1237
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:22,593
Not if you've guy like,
but you made him a million to is a lot 

1238
00:53:25,201 --> 00:53:26,280
of money,
you'll be fine.

1239
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:27,900
But he already has millions.
Yes.

1240
00:53:27,901 --> 00:53:29,610
You know,
Bernard is a wealthy guy still.

1241
00:53:29,611 --> 00:53:31,350
Even if it doesn't matter if he has 10 
million,

1242
00:53:31,351 --> 00:53:34,080
if he made a million for that fight,
him falling on his head like that,

1243
00:53:34,081 --> 00:53:35,910
but not if he's never the same again 
Eddie,

1244
00:53:35,911 --> 00:53:39,870
if your brain trauma or $1 million,
that's like saying people would line up,

1245
00:53:39,871 --> 00:53:41,780
say you've never done,
never had any brain trauma.

1246
00:53:41,781 --> 00:53:44,460
Huh?
Um,

1247
00:53:44,490 --> 00:53:46,380
I mean,
so no you haven't.

1248
00:53:46,410 --> 00:53:50,040
It leads to severe depression that 
sometimes people never get out of.

1249
00:53:50,490 --> 00:53:53,880
There's all sorts of real huge issues 
with your hormonal system.

1250
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,510
Like you're essentially compromising the
quality of your life forever.

1251
00:53:57,540 --> 00:54:01,000
I play peewee or certain circumstances.
Does that count 100% no,

1252
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:01,853
that was not Arizona with helmets,
but I know people that have been Kao 

1253
00:54:05,161 --> 00:54:07,080
that were essentially never the same 
again,

1254
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:10,130
$800,000
he made one not that is,

1255
00:54:10,131 --> 00:54:11,100
um,
it was worth,

1256
00:54:11,101 --> 00:54:11,850
it was worth it.

1257
00:54:11,850 --> 00:54:15,240
I wonder if that's the whole purse 
because that might be just like dad paid

1258
00:54:15,241 --> 00:54:16,650
for the fights.
A lot of money,

1259
00:54:16,651 --> 00:54:17,484
dude,
come on.

1260
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:18,543
It might have got a percentage of,
you know the promotion because he's the 

1261
00:54:21,121 --> 00:54:21,954
guy.
That's true.

1262
00:54:21,970 --> 00:54:23,700
It's a Monterey.
Even 2 million.

1263
00:54:23,701 --> 00:54:25,410
A guy like Bernard Hopkins is not worth 
it.

1264
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:26,303
The problem is the way landed.
It wasn't just the punches that he took 

1265
00:54:28,411 --> 00:54:30,750
because he's so skilled.
He's good at like moving.

1266
00:54:30,751 --> 00:54:32,550
Wish he was definitely going out.
Okay.

1267
00:54:32,730 --> 00:54:34,920
That left hook,
his legs were going out.

1268
00:54:34,921 --> 00:54:36,870
He got clipped,
he got hit with hammers.

1269
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:39,090
He was going out using shots before that
too.

1270
00:54:39,091 --> 00:54:41,070
But if he went down in the middle of the
ring,

1271
00:54:41,190 --> 00:54:42,630
we might be thinking,
you know,

1272
00:54:42,631 --> 00:54:43,464
like maybe he could survive the round or
maybe the referee is going to stop the 

1273
00:54:45,751 --> 00:54:47,910
fight.
He definitely wouldn't have taken that.

1274
00:54:48,070 --> 00:54:50,940
The real issue was his whole body was 
limp when he fell.

1275
00:54:50,941 --> 00:54:52,830
He just went right through stuff to 
watch.

1276
00:54:53,430 --> 00:54:54,540
That's awful,
man.

1277
00:54:55,130 --> 00:54:56,880
Just put some netting in it,
man.

1278
00:54:56,881 --> 00:54:58,770
Make it so that can happen.
You know?

1279
00:54:58,910 --> 00:54:59,743
But you remember how the Old School 
Valley Tuto days used to have a net in 

1280
00:55:02,041 --> 00:55:03,020
the bottom rope.
Yeah,

1281
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:04,710
it's pretty cool.
That was pretty dope.

1282
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:05,693
Not,
it doesn't have to be that ridiculous 

1283
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:10,260
like that.
Cause that was like the vans outside the

1284
00:55:10,261 --> 00:55:11,670
ring.
Like wwe,

1285
00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:14,170
it seems like those ropes were a little 
loose too.

1286
00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:16,230
We could fall out.
Ropes were definitely loose.

1287
00:55:16,231 --> 00:55:17,070
Yeah,
that's not good.

1288
00:55:17,130 --> 00:55:17,963
That's a huge issue.
That might've been something that 

1289
00:55:19,111 --> 00:55:19,944
Bernard liked so he can move,
you know like Bernard is really good at 

1290
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:27,750
like moving away from Shit and if he's 
contained up against like a hard rope,

1291
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:30,390
he doesn't have that ability to drill in
this stuff.

1292
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:31,333
True.
And you know like the best fighters who 

1293
00:55:33,361 --> 00:55:34,194
are really good at like utilizing the 
ropes would like lean back away from 

1294
00:55:37,771 --> 00:55:41,760
punches on the ropes.
And again it's golden boy promotions.

1295
00:55:41,761 --> 00:55:44,640
So I'm sure he had some say in that.
That's good point.

1296
00:55:44,730 --> 00:55:48,150
The kid is a killer.
Well he also thought his last fight,

1297
00:55:48,151 --> 00:55:52,110
he fought a cofa live,
like he's taken on two killers in a row.

1298
00:55:52,770 --> 00:55:53,603
Cova live.
Did you really think you're going to 

1299
00:55:54,951 --> 00:55:55,784
beat that guy?
I mean that's why we love Bernard 

1300
00:55:58,050 --> 00:55:58,890
Hopkins.
But God,

1301
00:55:58,980 --> 00:55:59,813
that's just shows you where a champion,
that guy is that he took those two 

1302
00:56:01,801 --> 00:56:02,634
fight,
that he decided to take the crusher and 

1303
00:56:04,471 --> 00:56:07,470
then this kid who is a relative unknown 
to most people,

1304
00:56:07,471 --> 00:56:10,140
but super super.
Who's got one?

1305
00:56:10,150 --> 00:56:11,500
One?
Yeah,

1306
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:14,040
he's super fucking name huge.
He's huge.

1307
00:56:14,041 --> 00:56:16,610
And he throws bombs.
Well I don't get it though,

1308
00:56:16,611 --> 00:56:18,180
cause it was a great job at Hbo.

1309
00:56:18,450 --> 00:56:19,650
Right?
Doing commentating.

1310
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:22,890
He's 51 what else do you need to do?
And Roy Jones is the same.

1311
00:56:23,350 --> 00:56:25,000
Roy Jones a flight,
a Turkey,

1312
00:56:25,170 --> 00:56:29,260
fine on some weird like live streaming.
Just get wax in the next week.

1313
00:56:29,350 --> 00:56:32,380
I think Roy Jones owes a lot of money in
taxes.

1314
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:33,633
I think that's what's going on.
That's what I had read that he owed 

1315
00:56:35,801 --> 00:56:38,680
millions of dollars in taxes from when 
he was champ.

1316
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:42,100
Maybe he got bad financial advice.
I don't know what the instances were,

1317
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:43,960
but uh,
that's why he does it.

1318
00:56:43,990 --> 00:56:45,250
Yeah,
that's a bummer.

1319
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:49,480
I'm pretty sure that's what's going on.
It's hard to balance because it's like,

1320
00:56:49,481 --> 00:56:52,960
why are you fighting this random Russian
and he's in Russia now.

1321
00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:54,910
Like a lot.
Like he's a Russian citizen.

1322
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:56,531
What?
Yeah.

1323
00:56:56,531 --> 00:56:59,710
Roy Jones Jr is a Russian citizen.
He lives in Florida too though.

1324
00:56:59,711 --> 00:57:01,550
Yeah.
Might as well be Russia.

1325
00:57:01,570 --> 00:57:02,403
They can have it.
No,

1326
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:06,970
I'm kidding.
My sister lives there.

1327
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:10,030
Let's just do that on site.
Hurl families there.

1328
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:12,130
It's just weird yet I do is fight.
Yeah.

1329
00:57:12,390 --> 00:57:13,750
Um,
Kovalev is,

1330
00:57:13,751 --> 00:57:15,070
uh,
he's fucking district.

1331
00:57:15,071 --> 00:57:16,750
He's out of Florida too.
He's been trained.

1332
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:18,670
He actually didn't he train up here for 
the last one?

1333
00:57:18,671 --> 00:57:20,410
I think he did.
I think he trained in Oxnard.

1334
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:25,510
Roy Jones Jr officially becomes Russian 
citizen with Moscow passport ceremony.

1335
00:57:25,690 --> 00:57:26,830
Wow.
And that crazy.

1336
00:57:29,170 --> 00:57:30,003
You know what man?
He's probably just enjoying his life 

1337
00:57:31,961 --> 00:57:33,250
over there.
Having a good time.

1338
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:35,080
True.
It's just hard to see.

1339
00:57:35,290 --> 00:57:36,123
Oh,
you've got to accept who he is now and 

1340
00:57:37,631 --> 00:57:40,810
not think of who he is now versus who he
used to be.

1341
00:57:40,811 --> 00:57:41,830
Impossible.
Yeah.

1342
00:57:41,831 --> 00:57:42,664
That's what it really is.
Because one of the things that like 

1343
00:57:44,291 --> 00:57:46,570
disturbed me,
this guy sounds so fucked up,

1344
00:57:46,990 --> 00:57:50,680
disturb me about his last knockout loss 
was how his body looked.

1345
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:53,440
I was looking at his body and I was 
like,

1346
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:55,480
this is,
this is Roy Jones Jr.

1347
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:56,613
He looked like shit.
He looked like he was not fit and it's 

1348
00:57:59,441 --> 00:58:00,274
not,
it's not an age thing because Bernard 

1349
00:58:01,331 --> 00:58:05,230
looked really fit when he fought Joe 
Smith Jr Bernard look very fit.

1350
00:58:05,530 --> 00:58:08,190
He didn't look like he did when he was 
30 no,

1351
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:10,840
but he looked very fit and he looked in 
shape,

1352
00:58:10,870 --> 00:58:13,420
you know,
but like when we were looking at Chavez,

1353
00:58:13,570 --> 00:58:14,800
Chavez never looked [inaudible].

1354
00:58:14,830 --> 00:58:15,663
He never looked like Melvin manhoef.
You know Julio Cesar Chavez was like 

1355
00:58:18,550 --> 00:58:20,920
fairly smooth.
It wasn't like this Jack Dude.

1356
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:24,100
Yeah,
but it's still murder guys.

1357
00:58:24,310 --> 00:58:27,850
So I feel like what we saw with Roy 
though was different thing.

1358
00:58:28,150 --> 00:58:31,000
It's like this can't,
he can't be working out like harsh,

1359
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:35,650
just shown up and talking to Murk.
These guys such so skilled and it's been

1360
00:58:35,651 --> 00:58:36,484
doing it for so long,
he probably feels like he's got a 

1361
00:58:38,261 --> 00:58:40,750
certain amount of boxes.
You see that knockout wasn't good.

1362
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:42,490
And another guy,
he fought,

1363
00:58:42,491 --> 00:58:44,860
he fought a fucking killer.
He fought a straight up killer.

1364
00:58:45,310 --> 00:58:46,143
See the UFC would never allow that.
Like say like if [inaudible] wanted to 

1365
00:58:49,661 --> 00:58:51,730
come back.
No Sir.

1366
00:58:51,790 --> 00:58:52,623
Well done.
Well that's one of the benefits of Dana 

1367
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:55,600
being your friend.
You know,

1368
00:58:55,630 --> 00:58:57,130
like Dana does,
doesn't want to have,

1369
00:58:57,940 --> 00:58:59,740
he just does not want to be a part of 
that.

1370
00:58:59,741 --> 00:59:01,240
And he's like,
I care about him.

1371
00:59:01,570 --> 00:59:03,550
I don't want him fighting again.
And he's right.

1372
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:06,460
I don't think they'd let any of those 
old timers come back to him.

1373
00:59:06,490 --> 00:59:07,211
Well that's the,
you know,

1374
00:59:07,211 --> 00:59:10,720
the problem is you can't tell someone 
what they can and can't do.

1375
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:12,100
Right.
They're grown ass man.

1376
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:15,790
But you also have to realize at a 
certain point in time,

1377
00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:16,983
like fight that that ego that a fighter 
has and it's hard to say who's who's 

1378
00:59:21,741 --> 00:59:21,980
right

1379
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:22,813
and who's wrong because like they said 
that about Bernard Hopkins when he 

1380
00:59:24,921 --> 00:59:28,310
fought Kelly Pavlik with fuck Kelly 
Pavlik they said he was done.

1381
00:59:28,570 --> 00:59:32,330
That was such the exception,
just such the exemption by alien.

1382
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:37,280
But because he was that exception,
we got to watch some crazy fights.

1383
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:38,173
But think of now,
but think about the other exceptions 

1384
00:59:39,831 --> 00:59:41,310
that it never worked out.
Well,

1385
00:59:41,311 --> 00:59:43,600
the difference is also Bernard had never
been knocked out before.

1386
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:45,590
True.
And he's a really skillful,

1387
00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:47,600
technically like really difficult to 
hit,

1388
00:59:47,630 --> 00:59:50,300
but it also would diminish the,
your product,

1389
00:59:50,301 --> 00:59:54,160
like the UFC would never have like 
coleman come back or Don Frye,

1390
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:57,380
I think of Joe Montana came back to 
shall pass.

1391
00:59:57,410 --> 01:00:00,560
What about that?
That was like that spice huge.

1392
01:00:01,220 --> 01:00:02,150
Yeah,
that was huge.

1393
01:00:02,420 --> 01:00:05,750
But you know that fight was,
it's a man.

1394
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:06,673
It's like at a certain,
you don't want to see a certain amount 

1395
01:00:09,141 --> 01:00:11,390
of deterioration from your champs.

1396
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:13,580
I don't want to see Jerry Rice catching 
passes right now.

1397
01:00:13,581 --> 01:00:17,000
There's fucking bad knees.
All dudes fight.

1398
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:18,810
Oh Dude,
why not let them fire all?

1399
01:00:18,950 --> 01:00:21,410
We're so worried about their distance.
They want to fight.

1400
01:00:21,411 --> 01:00:22,244
Let them fight.
You remember when Ray Mercer fought 

1401
01:00:23,451 --> 01:00:24,440
Larry Holmes?
Bitch,

1402
01:00:24,441 --> 01:00:29,441
your ass boxes face off like God damn 
lie homes was like 46 or some shit.

1403
01:00:29,571 --> 01:00:30,404
Then we're not going to let you find out
how old Larry Holmes was when he fought 

1404
01:00:33,111 --> 01:00:33,944
ray mercer.
And this is after Mike Tyson and marked 

1405
01:00:35,251 --> 01:00:36,084
them.
So Mike Tyson burped him and then Mike 

1406
01:00:38,060 --> 01:00:40,790
Tyson went to jail and then he was like,
as long as that mother fuckers in jail,

1407
01:00:40,791 --> 01:00:41,624
I'm boxing.

1408
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:47,300
Fuck.
What's that?

1409
01:00:47,301 --> 01:00:50,710
He was honest.
He fuck the Kings in jail.

1410
01:00:51,850 --> 01:00:53,270
They case the line.
Yeah,

1411
01:00:53,271 --> 01:00:55,100
I'm coming out.
Well it was all here.

1412
01:00:55,101 --> 01:00:55,934
Everyone had when they fought Mike Tyson
in those early days I would have loved 

1413
01:01:00,141 --> 01:01:02,480
to have seen Larry Holmes in his prime 
fight.

1414
01:01:02,481 --> 01:01:04,130
Mike Tyson.
Now we've got marlene,

1415
01:01:04,170 --> 01:01:08,270
Psalm 42 oh that's not that bad.
That's it.

1416
01:01:08,271 --> 01:01:09,104
That's a different 42 though.
That's not like a 42 in 2016 that's in 

1417
01:01:11,811 --> 01:01:16,811
1992 42 zero new Mexican supplements.
So totally different.

1418
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:23,060
Yeah,
that's totally different deal set.

1419
01:01:23,061 --> 01:01:24,890
A 42 year olds.
Heck crazy.

1420
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:26,273
We don't even think about,
cause I homes gotta be in his late 

1421
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:31,060
sixties or some shit.
Well I think he retired when he was like

1422
01:01:31,070 --> 01:01:31,903
51 or something like that.
I think he had like a fight like in his 

1423
01:01:34,371 --> 01:01:37,340
fifties but uh,
Larry Holmes in his prime,

1424
01:01:37,370 --> 01:01:39,410
like the Larry Holmes,
it fucked up Muhammad Ali.

1425
01:01:39,590 --> 01:01:42,910
He would give anyone a run for their 
money here.

1426
01:01:43,030 --> 01:01:47,070
He helped big day where that was the end
of Muhammad Ali.

1427
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:49,010
100%.
You're definitely right.

1428
01:01:49,011 --> 01:01:49,844
I still,
when you talk about like a vintage or 

1429
01:01:51,441 --> 01:01:55,490
you talked about fucking George Foreman,
those guys are so big man.

1430
01:01:55,730 --> 01:01:59,600
But you look at like Larry's body here.
This is not the same body that he had.

1431
01:01:59,630 --> 01:02:02,570
Like when he fought Ali,
he was doughy or,

1432
01:02:02,571 --> 01:02:03,404
and he had like a little bit of a,
well actually it doesn't look bad right 

1433
01:02:05,391 --> 01:02:06,830
here,
man doesn't look bad right here.

1434
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:09,590
This looks like the Larry Holmes that 
fought Mike Tyson,

1435
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:12,130
which was like hangs down.
Ooh,

1436
01:02:12,140 --> 01:02:13,250
you look good man.
One,

1437
01:02:13,251 --> 01:02:14,084
two,
but little slower than he was when he 

1438
01:02:15,321 --> 01:02:18,020
was young.
Ray Mercer was always a fucking murderer

1439
01:02:18,021 --> 01:02:18,740
though,
man.

1440
01:02:18,740 --> 01:02:20,550
He was scary dude.
Ray Mercer

1441
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,640
started late in his career,
wasn't he a military guy?

1442
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:29,060
He started in thirties,
Olympic gold medalist and boxing and uh,

1443
01:02:29,251 --> 01:02:31,530
we did it from the army.
He's a bad motherfucker dude.

1444
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,490
And he hit hard.
But Larry Holmes,

1445
01:02:35,910 --> 01:02:40,200
once the Fight War on got that Jab,
whenever I think back to these fights,

1446
01:02:40,220 --> 01:02:41,053
those,
I always think those guys hit so much 

1447
01:02:42,211 --> 01:02:44,370
harder than guys now.
Well,

1448
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:46,180
um,
they were knockout artists and,

1449
01:02:46,181 --> 01:02:47,014
and knock out artist like ray mercer.
He could be a knockout RC in any 

1450
01:02:48,871 --> 01:02:50,520
generation,
but Larry Holmes,

1451
01:02:50,790 --> 01:02:55,020
he would give fucking anybody today a 
run for their money.

1452
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:56,700
Anybody?
Anthony,

1453
01:02:56,701 --> 01:02:58,500
Joshua,
he would fuck up a lot of these guys.

1454
01:02:58,501 --> 01:03:00,600
Ben Klitschko,
Larry Holmes,

1455
01:03:00,601 --> 01:03:03,070
like go to Larry Holmes,
a beat Muhammad Ali because you're,

1456
01:03:03,071 --> 01:03:04,500
you're here.
You're watching Larry Holmes.

1457
01:03:04,501 --> 01:03:08,190
It's like 42 years old in 1992,
which is like 80 today.

1458
01:03:09,830 --> 01:03:14,120
85 no trt and no vitamins.
No,

1459
01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:16,430
didn't know nothing about Kido Watch.

1460
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:20,430
Go full screen and then just go to like 
the middle of the fight,

1461
01:03:20,431 --> 01:03:20,881
man.
Dude,

1462
01:03:20,881 --> 01:03:22,970
I went with ordinary home for the 
holidays.

1463
01:03:22,971 --> 01:03:23,581
So the cow,
good.

1464
01:03:23,581 --> 01:03:24,870
Larry Holmes.
Look back here,

1465
01:03:24,871 --> 01:03:26,940
man.
I'll look at his movement.

1466
01:03:26,941 --> 01:03:27,774
Yeah,
way,

1467
01:03:27,860 --> 01:03:29,610
way leaner,
way faster.

1468
01:03:29,670 --> 01:03:32,430
And look at his head movement.
Nasty Fucking Jab.

1469
01:03:32,550 --> 01:03:34,030
That's a different Muhammad Ali though.
Yeah,

1470
01:03:34,031 --> 01:03:34,864
it is different.
Muhammad Ali and it's a different Larry 

1471
01:03:36,210 --> 01:03:38,930
Holmes till this is Larry Holmes who was
a punisher like look at he's,

1472
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:39,773
he's angry with that chat was like,
it makes a mean face when he's popping 

1473
01:03:43,861 --> 01:03:44,694
them with it.
Larry Holmes was a bad motherfucker 

1474
01:03:46,380 --> 01:03:47,970
dude.
And he fought smart too.

1475
01:03:47,971 --> 01:03:48,804
I mean he respected Ali and just what 
systematically beat him down and it was 

1476
01:03:52,081 --> 01:03:56,620
hard to watch because Ali was way past 
his prime way past his punch.

1477
01:03:56,621 --> 01:03:59,910
A bummer man.
It was a huge bummer to watch because we

1478
01:03:59,911 --> 01:04:02,970
were absolutely sure that Ali was 
getting fucked up.

1479
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:05,100
There was no going on.
Yeah.

1480
01:04:05,130 --> 01:04:07,380
There was no denying it towards,
you know,

1481
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:10,230
the remaining rounds of the fight.
I forget how long it went,

1482
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:12,540
you know,
the best body and box and vault time.

1483
01:04:12,570 --> 01:04:15,540
You ready for this evander holyfield.
Oh yeah.

1484
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:18,110
It's a good argument.
Jacked.

1485
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,430
Yeah,
he's about as Jack did you get tough.

1486
01:04:21,431 --> 01:04:22,264
Fuck.
He was one of the first guys to like 

1487
01:04:23,671 --> 01:04:24,504
legitimately put on muscle and move up 
to the heavyweight division to remember 

1488
01:04:27,841 --> 01:04:30,930
when he was a cruiserweight champion.
Remember when he fought dwight cow?

1489
01:04:30,931 --> 01:04:34,750
We do commander Holyfield at 
cruiserweight fought Dwight Mohammed cow

1490
01:04:34,751 --> 01:04:39,751
who was five seven the Camden buzzsaw 
off five 795 pounds.

1491
01:04:41,970 --> 01:04:43,560
It's bus saw.
What a great,

1492
01:04:43,590 --> 01:04:44,590
yeah dude,
he did.

1493
01:04:44,670 --> 01:04:45,503
That dude was an animal.
He was built so weird and he went up to 

1494
01:04:47,941 --> 01:04:48,774
heavyweight after that.
Any fucked a lot of guys at five seven 

1495
01:04:52,340 --> 01:04:54,510
Dwight Kawi.
I'm pretty sure he's five seven.

1496
01:04:54,511 --> 01:04:55,231
I'm not,
I'm,

1497
01:04:55,231 --> 01:04:57,150
I don't,
I don't believe I'm exaggerating that.

1498
01:04:57,810 --> 01:04:58,643
I think he was literally an inch shorter
than me and he was fighting as a light 

1499
01:05:01,651 --> 01:05:02,484
motherfucking heavyweight and a 
heavyweight and cruise cruiserweight is 

1500
01:05:05,761 --> 01:05:08,220
really where it started.
One 95 but he was at tank.

1501
01:05:08,550 --> 01:05:12,180
He's was like this fucking jacked up 
looking who some are Paul Harris looking

1502
01:05:12,181 --> 01:05:13,680
dude look like God job.
Yeah,

1503
01:05:13,690 --> 01:05:14,370
but,
but I,

1504
01:05:14,370 --> 01:05:14,880
I,
you know,

1505
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:16,530
I don't know if it was supplements back 
then,

1506
01:05:16,531 --> 01:05:18,090
I think five,
six years,

1507
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:20,710
five six that was wrong.
That is a short one.

1508
01:05:20,711 --> 01:05:23,110
90 but wa watch him fight,
man.

1509
01:05:23,111 --> 01:05:27,220
It was just so weird because he was a 
dangerous big powerful guy.

1510
01:05:27,221 --> 01:05:31,110
Look at Vendor Holyfield Ben,
that's the lien of Ander.

1511
01:05:31,130 --> 01:05:34,480
Holyfield coming out of the Olympics.
Hunt yelling at him.

1512
01:05:35,050 --> 01:05:37,060
Yeah,
it's a different evander.

1513
01:05:37,270 --> 01:05:40,300
This was skinny young evander,
but look at coffee man.

1514
01:05:40,301 --> 01:05:45,301
Just just this tank of a dude short and 
throws these looping over hand shots and

1515
01:05:46,181 --> 01:05:50,350
you're always punching down on and look 
at the size difference man and just hard

1516
01:05:50,351 --> 01:05:52,240
as nails.
A hard as nails.

1517
01:05:52,241 --> 01:05:53,420
Dude,
don't ball.

1518
01:05:53,421 --> 01:05:56,050
Just like fucking give a fuck.
He's like,

1519
01:05:56,051 --> 01:05:59,710
I'm not here to Slang Dick.
I'm going to sling some leather.

1520
01:05:59,950 --> 01:06:03,930
Look at his socks,
the lesson,

1521
01:06:03,970 --> 01:06:08,970
1990 sweat socks.
They were killing it back then.

1522
01:06:09,020 --> 01:06:09,853
Cow.
We had a totally different approach 

1523
01:06:11,141 --> 01:06:12,850
because he was so short for that 
division.

1524
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:15,360
When you watched him fight,
it was like confusing.

1525
01:06:15,361 --> 01:06:16,930
It's like,
I ain't never seen this before.

1526
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:21,460
Like holy field was be like two feet 
taller than him at points because cow.

1527
01:06:21,461 --> 01:06:22,294
We also fought crouched,
so he had moved in tight guard crouched 

1528
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:28,660
Tyson style.
No,

1529
01:06:28,661 --> 01:06:29,710
he had his own thing.
Mad.

1530
01:06:29,711 --> 01:06:30,544
A lot of bobbing and weaving.
He didn't have the same sort of 

1531
01:06:32,261 --> 01:06:35,620
combination,
ruthless punching style that Tyson did.

1532
01:06:35,740 --> 01:06:38,980
Tyson could just fuck you up with one 
shot and he knew it.

1533
01:06:39,140 --> 01:06:42,730
[inaudible] was like a Mauler.
He would maul you like that right there.

1534
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,070
But he's fighting guys way bigger than 
him.

1535
01:06:45,310 --> 01:06:48,670
You know Tyson was probably like five 11
right?

1536
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:49,533
Wasn't it?
Somewhere on there.

1537
01:06:49,540 --> 01:06:50,650
I thought.
Still Short.

1538
01:06:51,060 --> 01:06:53,410
Still Short.
Still Short,

1539
01:06:53,620 --> 01:06:54,910
but a different,
oh,

1540
01:06:54,911 --> 01:06:57,760
holyfield connected and drops him.
Holyfield I mean,

1541
01:06:57,761 --> 01:06:58,750
that's what I'm saying.
Motherfucker.

1542
01:06:59,740 --> 01:07:01,930
Motherfucker.
Remember his fight with Burke Cooper?

1543
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:02,793
Another one?
No,

1544
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:04,270
I don't.
Oh my goodness.

1545
01:07:04,330 --> 01:07:05,163
I really os burt cooper like on the 
verge of superstardom and him and 

1546
01:07:09,191 --> 01:07:13,810
Holyfield Godo Wiz are with our son 
Evander Holyfield.

1547
01:07:13,811 --> 01:07:15,220
I mean just,
he was awesome.

1548
01:07:15,250 --> 01:07:16,083
Past go to holyfield versus Burt Cooper 
dropping some boxing knowledge on you 

1549
01:07:19,811 --> 01:07:21,820
motherfuckers done.
I should know about mma.

1550
01:07:22,550 --> 01:07:23,383
Yeah,
I was huge.

1551
01:07:23,590 --> 01:07:24,850
Eddie Bravo and I both,
man,

1552
01:07:24,851 --> 01:07:27,070
we were huge boxing fans.
While you're still,

1553
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:28,260
he's still,
I love it.

1554
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:30,460
I can't get [inaudible].
We stopped him,

1555
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:34,600
look at that and he stopped him.
Been talking about boxing for an hour.

1556
01:07:35,710 --> 01:07:38,440
Poli field,
man in his prime,

1557
01:07:39,150 --> 01:07:40,190
Dan,
I dropped.

1558
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:43,180
That was the second time they fought 
Jamie.

1559
01:07:43,181 --> 01:07:45,580
That's the second time.
That was when Kylie was older.

1560
01:07:45,910 --> 01:07:46,743
See if you can find the first one.
The first one was the revenge fight 

1561
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:54,010
because in the first fight they went to 
war and a cow.

1562
01:07:54,011 --> 01:07:56,890
We and Evander Holyfield went to war,
but cow,

1563
01:07:56,891 --> 01:08:00,560
we wound up losing the decision and it 
was like a big fight for a vendor.

1564
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:03,100
So that was the second one.
What is this?

1565
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:07,480
I thought I clicked too quick.
It's Tim Fighting George Foreman.

1566
01:08:07,481 --> 01:08:09,910
George Foreman versus cow.
We how ridiculous is that?

1567
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:11,950
So George Foreman,
fod.

1568
01:08:11,951 --> 01:08:13,720
Kali.
Kali was five six.

1569
01:08:13,721 --> 01:08:16,610
George Foreman's fucking hands were a 
foot wide.

1570
01:08:17,330 --> 01:08:20,630
That's ridiculous.
No thought he fought at 50 didn't me.

1571
01:08:20,750 --> 01:08:23,300
Oh yeah,
you won the title at 46 you know what to

1572
01:08:23,301 --> 01:08:24,890
say?
Former hardest hitter of all time.

1573
01:08:25,070 --> 01:08:27,650
I believe it.
Remember that Michael's prime,

1574
01:08:27,660 --> 01:08:29,860
that you're forming fire.
Look at it.

1575
01:08:29,861 --> 01:08:31,700
So this is the first Gulf war with one 
punch.

1576
01:08:31,730 --> 01:08:35,360
This was when Kylie was younger and this
was a really close fight.

1577
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:36,553
This is the different fight.
The second fight of was just on a 

1578
01:08:38,721 --> 01:08:40,880
totally different level and [inaudible] 
was older,

1579
01:08:41,570 --> 01:08:43,790
but [inaudible] he used to,
whereas his waist,

1580
01:08:44,150 --> 01:08:47,900
his pants rather as his belt,
way the fuck up high.

1581
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:51,590
The straps of his shorts were like way 
above his belly button.

1582
01:08:51,890 --> 01:08:54,710
He looks like the blue guy or the green 
debt from Monsters Inc.

1583
01:08:54,770 --> 01:08:56,220
Yeah,
this is just the whole body then.

1584
01:08:56,560 --> 01:09:00,080
There's not a lot to hit now and this 
little fire hydrant,

1585
01:09:00,890 --> 01:09:03,110
but this is like holy fields first big 
test.

1586
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:05,040
But see if you can go to,
uh,

1587
01:09:05,050 --> 01:09:06,290
that other fight that we're talking 
about.

1588
01:09:06,580 --> 01:09:09,680
Lean holyfield his man there.
He's so skinny.

1589
01:09:09,710 --> 01:09:10,543
What was the other five?
Burke Cooper go holyfield burke coover 

1590
01:09:13,940 --> 01:09:18,940
holyfield burke hoover was crazy war and
this is like 1991,

1591
01:09:19,431 --> 01:09:22,980
I think.
And Burke Cooper was a bad mother fucker

1592
01:09:22,981 --> 01:09:25,490
smoking burt that go go deep into the 
fight here.

1593
01:09:25,491 --> 01:09:27,890
Young Jamie.
What kind of,

1594
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:28,600
Oh,
okay.

1595
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:30,200
Eventually Kill Them.
More rocked up here.

1596
01:09:30,201 --> 01:09:33,410
Son Per Cooper was a savage man.
He knocked motherfuckers out too.

1597
01:09:33,411 --> 01:09:37,370
He's a vicious power puncher and this 
was like a sort of a make or break fight

1598
01:09:37,371 --> 01:09:38,204
for him because a lot of people thought 
that burke crew like Burke Cooper could 

1599
01:09:42,891 --> 01:09:43,790
fuck it crack.

1600
01:09:45,020 --> 01:09:45,853
And a lot of people thought that Burke 
Cooper had a shot at being like one of 

1601
01:09:48,081 --> 01:09:48,914
the top guys and this,
this was the fight that separated these 

1602
01:09:51,021 --> 01:09:53,240
two guys.
Just an awesome fight,

1603
01:09:53,241 --> 01:09:54,060
man.
GRC,

1604
01:09:54,060 --> 01:09:57,500
some Jessia vantage crib in Atlanta.
It's not really a house.

1605
01:09:57,860 --> 01:09:58,693
It's more like a,
I would tell her your campus like a 

1606
01:10:00,621 --> 01:10:05,621
college straight up fucking giant 
university from the dus suggest like USC

1607
01:10:06,561 --> 01:10:08,180
or some shit in Atlanta.
Yeah,

1608
01:10:08,270 --> 01:10:12,050
like a hundred room mantra.
When are you just doing balls?

1609
01:10:12,870 --> 01:10:15,140
He went balls out.
That's how,

1610
01:10:15,141 --> 01:10:16,970
um,
uh,

1611
01:10:17,570 --> 01:10:18,403
um,
Ron White described Larry the cable 

1612
01:10:20,691 --> 01:10:21,650
guy's place.
That's who it was.

1613
01:10:21,660 --> 01:10:22,161
He said,
Larry,

1614
01:10:22,161 --> 01:10:23,930
the cable guy's house looks like a 
university.

1615
01:10:23,950 --> 01:10:26,270
Really?
And he's like not Phoenix University.

1616
01:10:28,590 --> 01:10:29,423
Did I say oh was the case?
I'm sure that's where I came from guys 

1617
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:33,090
too though.
Yeah,

1618
01:10:33,090 --> 01:10:35,690
I'm sure both of those guys live in 
fucking giant mansions.

1619
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:37,610
Larry the cable guy's a funny dude,
man,

1620
01:10:37,930 --> 01:10:38,721
is he?
Yeah,

1621
01:10:38,721 --> 01:10:39,800
he's a nice guy too,
man.

1622
01:10:39,830 --> 01:10:40,663
I used to hang with that guy in the 
Montreal comedy festival before anybody 

1623
01:10:43,191 --> 01:10:45,240
knew who he was and he was funny back 
there.

1624
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:46,100
He's a good dude,
man.

1625
01:10:46,101 --> 01:10:46,934
He was doing that.
Larry the cable guy thing on a radio 

1626
01:10:48,351 --> 01:10:49,184
show in Florida.
It was like a character that he did and 

1627
01:10:52,311 --> 01:10:55,970
then cause he'd have his regular stamp 
and then that was just a bit that you do

1628
01:10:56,140 --> 01:10:59,210
it late I think.
I'm not exactly sure the origins of it,

1629
01:10:59,330 --> 01:11:03,110
but I think he started out doing radio 
and then from radio he started taking it

1630
01:11:03,111 --> 01:11:04,370
to the stage,
but his real name,

1631
01:11:04,540 --> 01:11:07,540
this visit videos of him as Dan Whitney 
doing standup.

1632
01:11:07,550 --> 01:11:08,510
Damn.
Yeah.

1633
01:11:08,540 --> 01:11:11,540
I didn't realize how big it was.
I think I wasn't making fun of him and I

1634
01:11:11,541 --> 01:11:12,920
was like,
cause that guy is still alive.

1635
01:11:13,050 --> 01:11:14,010
I think we're on this showing

1636
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:15,480
you like what?
Boom,

1637
01:11:15,481 --> 01:11:19,260
Nebraska sold out fucking arenas,
arenas and shit.

1638
01:11:19,261 --> 01:11:22,320
Josh Wolfe took a picture of himself 
opening up for Larry,

1639
01:11:22,321 --> 01:11:25,500
the cable guy in a football arena that 
was sold out.

1640
01:11:25,530 --> 01:11:27,450
God,
God in the south,

1641
01:11:27,451 --> 01:11:29,580
dude,
shut your mouth shut.

1642
01:11:29,581 --> 01:11:30,960
Shut your mouth.
Mouth.

1643
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:34,140
You got think man Nascar and fucking 
redneck joke.

1644
01:11:34,141 --> 01:11:34,974
This is what you've got to think.
There are 300 in who knows how many 

1645
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:43,650
millions in this country and you go down
South Larry,

1646
01:11:43,651 --> 01:11:46,980
the cable guy can get millions of people
to see him.

1647
01:11:47,190 --> 01:11:49,590
He might be able to do a million person 
show.

1648
01:11:49,591 --> 01:11:51,540
How the fuck,
not sky's the limit.

1649
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:54,670
If you had a million seat arena,
he's selling it.

1650
01:11:54,671 --> 01:11:55,504
And Larry,
the cable guy might sell out a fucking 

1651
01:11:57,091 --> 01:11:59,130
million seat arena.
And that's not a bullshit.

1652
01:11:59,190 --> 01:12:00,810
That's not bullshit.
What is that about?

1653
01:12:00,811 --> 01:12:02,670
Can you explain that?
It's a funny dude,

1654
01:12:02,820 --> 01:12:04,290
but he also represents them.

1655
01:12:04,290 --> 01:12:07,240
He's like a very good joke writer.
He's south.

1656
01:12:07,310 --> 01:12:08,143
Well it's,
he also represents them like he's doing 

1657
01:12:09,901 --> 01:12:12,380
like redneck sort of Shayne's third 
democrats.

1658
01:12:12,750 --> 01:12:15,390
This is the voice and it's really well 
written.

1659
01:12:15,391 --> 01:12:17,370
It's funny shit.
You know,

1660
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:18,360
he's,
and he's a good dude.

1661
01:12:18,361 --> 01:12:19,910
He's a genuinely good dude.
And,

1662
01:12:19,930 --> 01:12:21,950
and him and Jeff,
Jeff Fox,

1663
01:12:22,770 --> 01:12:25,080
Jeff foxworthy.
It was like the captain of that ship.

1664
01:12:25,100 --> 01:12:25,933
Yeah.
And then those other guys and Ron White 

1665
01:12:26,971 --> 01:12:29,570
and he brought ron white in apparently.
Um,

1666
01:12:29,670 --> 01:12:31,490
and Ron White was,
you know,

1667
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:32,760
doing well.
I mean,

1668
01:12:32,761 --> 01:12:34,440
everybody knew who he was.
I knew who he was.

1669
01:12:34,441 --> 01:12:37,980
Everybody knew like he was a,
a well respected headliners clubs,

1670
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:39,233
but people didn't really know how 
fucking funny he was until Jeff 

1671
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:43,770
Foxworthy put them in front of 
everybody.

1672
01:12:44,010 --> 01:12:47,190
He's a great guy to then corrections.
They're super dirty.

1673
01:12:47,191 --> 01:12:49,440
Southern Guy.
Ron White's pretty dirty.

1674
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:52,000
Ron White has this whole bit about,
um,

1675
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:57,200
how when he was in the navy stationed in
Hawaii,

1676
01:12:57,420 --> 01:12:58,253
he kept,
he was getting his dick sucked by 

1677
01:12:58,951 --> 01:13:00,360
hookers and you'd know they were girls.

1678
01:13:00,750 --> 01:13:01,583
They were boys.
He thought that there were girls the 

1679
01:13:02,821 --> 01:13:03,654
whole time until like years later,
he was watching some show about during 

1680
01:13:07,231 --> 01:13:11,520
the 1970s when he was there,
all these transvestite hookers that were

1681
01:13:11,521 --> 01:13:15,630
operating in this one block that he used
to go like every day to get my dentist.

1682
01:13:16,230 --> 01:13:18,750
He's like,
I got my dick sucked by about 150.

1683
01:13:18,751 --> 01:13:19,584
Dude,
he's talking about it last week on the 

1684
01:13:26,281 --> 01:13:27,114
podcast.
If you haven't heard the Ron White 

1685
01:13:27,721 --> 01:13:28,950
podcasts,
listen to that shit.

1686
01:13:28,951 --> 01:13:31,050
He's a genius.
He's a brilliant story teller.

1687
01:13:31,051 --> 01:13:33,960
He's from stand up,
stand up and he's such a good dude.

1688
01:13:33,961 --> 01:13:35,390
So He's,
he's uh,

1689
01:13:35,430 --> 01:13:37,170
um,
the blue country guy.

1690
01:13:37,530 --> 01:13:39,060
Yeah,
he's a dirty country guy for sure,

1691
01:13:39,061 --> 01:13:40,080
but there's college.
Those guys,

1692
01:13:40,350 --> 01:13:43,070
you know what man,
it's just I think um,

1693
01:13:43,410 --> 01:13:46,350
with when it comes to like what we think
of as country,

1694
01:13:46,351 --> 01:13:48,210
like we think of as the south,
you know,

1695
01:13:48,211 --> 01:13:50,940
I think people who live in cities are 
very prejudiced of it.

1696
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:54,660
I don't think it's the same thing today 
as it was 20 years ago.

1697
01:13:56,910 --> 01:13:58,490
Everybody knows things now,
man.

1698
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:01,680
Everybody understands things way better 
now than they ever did before.

1699
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:05,880
Like if you lived in like a West 
Virginia in the 1970s,

1700
01:14:06,180 --> 01:14:08,670
you probably,
if you lived in a real rural coal mining

1701
01:14:08,671 --> 01:14:09,660
community or something like that,
like,

1702
01:14:09,661 --> 01:14:12,310
man,
good luck getting any sort of access

1703
01:14:12,460 --> 01:14:16,030
to any information other than what's 
right in front of you in your town.

1704
01:14:16,270 --> 01:14:17,103
But now,
now you've got a phone and everybody 

1705
01:14:19,540 --> 01:14:21,880
cell tells you something.
You can just check your phone and go,

1706
01:14:21,881 --> 01:14:23,310
well that's not really true.
You know,

1707
01:14:23,420 --> 01:14:25,840
I just googled it and Stephen Hawkins 
says that this,

1708
01:14:25,841 --> 01:14:30,550
Ooh and you will these kids,
they can be way more informed today than

1709
01:14:30,551 --> 01:14:31,384
they were back then.
So I think when people think of the 

1710
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:33,664
rural south as being like that,
I think that was a part of a problem 

1711
01:14:35,831 --> 01:14:36,664
with this last election.
I think a lot of people thought like 

1712
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:41,433
that.
There's certain people that live in 

1713
01:14:42,281 --> 01:14:45,220
certain places that are just stupid,
you know,

1714
01:14:45,221 --> 01:14:45,511
the,
the,

1715
01:14:45,511 --> 01:14:49,180
the red states and then the,
these people are ignorant who'd say,

1716
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:50,033
and they proved it with the election.
Like the problem with even saying that 

1717
01:14:53,021 --> 01:14:58,021
is people don't like when certain people
talk shit about them,

1718
01:14:58,570 --> 01:14:59,403
they don't like it.

1719
01:14:59,410 --> 01:15:00,460
Right.
It makes them feel bad.

1720
01:15:00,461 --> 01:15:02,380
If you make fun of people live in West 
Virginia,

1721
01:15:02,381 --> 01:15:05,980
like I just did people in West Virginia 
to get pissed off right there.

1722
01:15:06,380 --> 01:15:08,380
It's not the state,
not the same people anymore.

1723
01:15:08,550 --> 01:15:09,383
Like our ideas of these like spots of 
the country where they don't have 

1724
01:15:13,181 --> 01:15:15,580
information.
We've got to let go of that idea.

1725
01:15:15,970 --> 01:15:16,803
Like there's depth there.
Definitely like leaning more right in 

1726
01:15:18,971 --> 01:15:21,100
some places than left.
And that makes sense.

1727
01:15:21,101 --> 01:15:21,934
But there's still a ton of fucking 
people that get it in these places that 

1728
01:15:26,051 --> 01:15:29,470
didn't exist just 20 years ago.
Well yeah cause it,

1729
01:15:29,570 --> 01:15:31,940
especially to your point,
because the smartphones,

1730
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:32,800
like everyone thinks,
I'm like,

1731
01:15:32,830 --> 01:15:35,410
Oh hey,
like what's going on out there?

1732
01:15:35,411 --> 01:15:37,240
But they're fucking,
it's easy.

1733
01:15:37,270 --> 01:15:39,310
Like you said,
don't even bring up Google or whatever,

1734
01:15:39,430 --> 01:15:41,400
any news.
Like my dad and I,

1735
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:42,273
my dad's in town,
we know argument and he's up against 

1736
01:15:43,551 --> 01:15:45,070
some point and I was like,
oh cool.

1737
01:15:45,190 --> 01:15:46,510
Just went on my phone was like,
nope,

1738
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:49,480
wrong.
And end up discussion.

1739
01:15:49,481 --> 01:15:50,680
So I don't know what you want to do.

1740
01:15:52,870 --> 01:15:53,703
Well people just have these ideas in 
their head and they've had them for a 

1741
01:15:55,811 --> 01:15:57,700
long time.
And uh,

1742
01:15:57,701 --> 01:16:00,100
you know,
if you live in a rural community and you

1743
01:16:00,101 --> 01:16:00,934
don't have the internet,
you could just stick with those ideas 

1744
01:16:02,591 --> 01:16:03,424
and those ideas will be transferred onto
your kids and transfer it onto their 

1745
01:16:05,981 --> 01:16:07,090
kids.
And it's,

1746
01:16:07,091 --> 01:16:08,530
you're fucked.
You're fucked.

1747
01:16:08,531 --> 01:16:09,364
If you live in a tough spot like that,
if you live in a bad place filled with 

1748
01:16:12,221 --> 01:16:15,500
dumb people and there's no new stuff 
coming in,

1749
01:16:15,510 --> 01:16:16,343
you got to get the fuck out and you 
don't even know how you're going to get 

1750
01:16:17,531 --> 01:16:18,880
out.
Or if you're,

1751
01:16:18,910 --> 01:16:22,600
if you just don't have access like North
Korea and they just have no fucking clue

1752
01:16:22,601 --> 01:16:23,434
what's cause.
See what they were making them do for 

1753
01:16:24,430 --> 01:16:27,370
North Korea with Kim Jong rooms making 
them do on Christmas.

1754
01:16:27,850 --> 01:16:28,683
No,
he makes people worship the mother of 

1755
01:16:30,341 --> 01:16:31,210
the revolution.

1756
01:16:31,510 --> 01:16:32,343
The his grandmother who was the wife of 
the first dictator of North Korea who 

1757
01:16:37,841 --> 01:16:38,674
she died of mysterious causes and like 
1949 and so like he is so anti 

1758
01:16:43,391 --> 01:16:44,800
Christmas.
This guy,

1759
01:16:44,801 --> 01:16:45,634
he literally is like,
he's like a character and a Dr Seuss 

1760
01:16:48,321 --> 01:16:51,250
wavy ticky so anti Christmas,
she's like the grinch.

1761
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:54,370
So they have to celebrate his dead.
They have to celebrate his grandmother,

1762
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:57,550
the mother of the revolution,
the fullest.

1763
01:16:57,551 --> 01:16:58,384
Crazy.
You estimate 18 Korean cities disappear 

1764
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:04,810
during that war.
Look at that and that's why he,

1765
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:10,000
I mean 18 cities disappeared.
What do you mean the war

1766
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:14,570
on the Korean war between bombed 18 
cities in the North Korea?

1767
01:17:14,700 --> 01:17:16,220
Yes.
And then the hole,

1768
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:18,890
that's when the regime started.
Well,

1769
01:17:18,891 --> 01:17:20,650
the Korean War,
um,

1770
01:17:20,690 --> 01:17:23,830
when did that end?
Uh,

1771
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:29,060
fifties in the 50s.
Some June does a weird war,

1772
01:17:29,061 --> 01:17:30,530
right?
Like people don't really talk about that

1773
01:17:30,531 --> 01:17:31,600
one too.
We're talking about the,

1774
01:17:31,610 --> 01:17:33,200
but they did,
it was,

1775
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:35,320
I was watching a documentary about,
uh,

1776
01:17:35,330 --> 01:17:37,100
how doctors,
uh,

1777
01:17:37,130 --> 01:17:38,960
they're allowed to go into,
um,

1778
01:17:39,100 --> 01:17:39,933
everyone's Korean and fix people's eyes.
They give them like a month and these 

1779
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:43,993
doctors from China,
they come in and they do the cataract 

1780
01:17:46,161 --> 01:17:49,640
surgery and his assistant snuck in.
She was a journalist.

1781
01:17:49,641 --> 01:17:51,590
She posed as an assistant just to get 
in,

1782
01:17:51,591 --> 01:17:54,020
just to get some footage of on the 
inside.

1783
01:17:54,410 --> 01:17:55,340
So it was about,
you know,

1784
01:17:55,430 --> 01:17:57,080
it is fucking weird.
And North Korea,

1785
01:17:57,081 --> 01:17:59,630
it's weird as fuck.
And that guy is crazy as fuck.

1786
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:04,280
But at the top of that documentary,
that was not pro North Korea,

1787
01:18:04,281 --> 01:18:06,170
it was,
it was anti North Korea.

1788
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:07,153
But at the very top of it,
when she's breaking down with the 

1789
01:18:08,601 --> 01:18:10,310
documentaries about it,
she,

1790
01:18:10,311 --> 01:18:11,144
she,
she mentioned how 18 cities evaporated 

1791
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:16,400
in the war.
It's war son.

1792
01:18:17,030 --> 01:18:17,863
Exactly.
No wonder there's so much hate for the 

1793
01:18:20,031 --> 01:18:23,780
fucking dus.
What their issue is,

1794
01:18:23,781 --> 01:18:24,614
their issue was their dictator is 
ruthless and is dominating them with 

1795
01:18:27,801 --> 01:18:29,330
fear.
He bases it on that,

1796
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:32,510
but that doesn't make any sense.
He's doing it against his own people.

1797
01:18:32,511 --> 01:18:35,490
What he's doing is imprisoning his 
entire country.

1798
01:18:36,530 --> 01:18:40,100
I agree with that bombing 18 cities.
It's fucking disgusting.

1799
01:18:40,380 --> 01:18:42,930
But think about that.
So just as bad,

1800
01:18:43,480 --> 01:18:45,860
like it's almost like you could 
understand it was an abused child.

1801
01:18:45,861 --> 01:18:48,660
You know what I mean?
18 sit q man's,

1802
01:18:48,670 --> 01:18:49,503
but he's fucking country out there.
If there was a country out there that 

1803
01:18:52,050 --> 01:18:57,050
firebombed 18 of our major cities,
why would we feel about that country?

1804
01:18:57,470 --> 01:18:58,303
You would be,
you'd be fucking lynched if you said 

1805
01:18:59,751 --> 01:19:02,280
anything pro that country.
It would be that kind of church.

1806
01:19:02,300 --> 01:19:04,490
I go to bed.
You Bet.

1807
01:19:04,550 --> 01:19:07,130
That's like Holocaust type shit.
You bring up that shit.

1808
01:19:07,190 --> 01:19:09,800
You'd be fucking bed.
You'd just keep that shit to yourself.

1809
01:19:09,801 --> 01:19:10,634
Well,
that's what you ever talked to someone 

1810
01:19:11,361 --> 01:19:13,550
who has,
who's Armenian,

1811
01:19:13,580 --> 01:19:15,830
who's spoken to an Armenian genocide 
denier.

1812
01:19:16,250 --> 01:19:17,083
There's a lot of like that Armenian 
genocide is a very rarely discussed 

1813
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:23,850
holocaust.
I mean not,

1814
01:19:23,851 --> 01:19:25,250
not the Holocaust,
but you know,

1815
01:19:25,370 --> 01:19:28,610
in terms of the use the word to describe
an atrocity,

1816
01:19:28,850 --> 01:19:31,280
it was a terrible thing.
And there's deniers of that.

1817
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:35,630
And when you find an Armenian and you 
talked to him about people that deny the

1818
01:19:35,631 --> 01:19:38,510
Armenian genocide,
I remember manny,

1819
01:19:38,511 --> 01:19:39,344
I'm gim Berean.
He won a fight and I was interviewing 

1820
01:19:42,021 --> 01:19:42,854
them after the fight and he was 
dedicating to fight the fight to the 

1821
01:19:45,620 --> 01:19:48,320
Armenian genocide to the victim.
So the Armenian genocide.

1822
01:19:48,350 --> 01:19:50,810
Okay.
And I remember thinking,

1823
01:19:50,811 --> 01:19:51,644
wow,
like when was the last time you even 

1824
01:19:52,581 --> 01:19:54,300
heard about that?
Nobody ever talks about that.

1825
01:19:54,780 --> 01:19:55,613
Never,
never.

1826
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:56,473
It never gets discussed.
I think Shirley and people died and I'm 

1827
01:19:59,151 --> 01:20:00,950
pretty sure it,
La has the biggest,

1828
01:20:01,430 --> 01:20:03,890
um,
Armenian population population that it,

1829
01:20:03,891 --> 01:20:04,910
right?
Pretty sure.

1830
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:06,560
Hell yeah.
You go to Glendale.

1831
01:20:07,470 --> 01:20:08,303
Wow.

1832
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:13,740
Okay.
The United States drop 635 tons of bombs

1833
01:20:13,741 --> 01:20:17,670
in Korea,
not counting 32,557

1834
01:20:17,671 --> 01:20:18,504
tons of napalm compared to 503 tons in 
the entire Pacific theater in World War 

1835
01:20:24,060 --> 01:20:28,650
II.
At least 50% of 18 out of the north,

1836
01:20:28,651 --> 01:20:33,390
22 major cities were obliterated.
Holy Shit.

1837
01:20:34,260 --> 01:20:36,570
Holy Shit.
Right?

1838
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:37,590
Was that right?
Yeah,

1839
01:20:37,591 --> 01:20:39,600
you're 100% right.
I mean this is the Internet.

1840
01:20:39,630 --> 01:20:42,390
Are we in the library?
Did you get that from library.com?

1841
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:44,910
Um,
that is terrifying.

1842
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:45,773
Look at the images up there.
Napalm bomb that you kind of look at 

1843
01:20:47,871 --> 01:20:52,410
that in Joan will or whenever the book,
his name is as crazy as fuck for sure.

1844
01:20:52,620 --> 01:20:53,453
But he caught you kind of understand 
when someone's really crazy and they've 

1845
01:20:55,681 --> 01:20:57,870
been abused and tortured as a child.
You,

1846
01:20:57,890 --> 01:21:01,440
you kind of like,
I understand what you're saying,

1847
01:21:02,010 --> 01:21:03,400
but um,
I can't,

1848
01:21:03,660 --> 01:21:05,750
I guess the argument would be that if 
they didn't do it,

1849
01:21:05,830 --> 01:21:08,880
what was the war over?
The war was over communism.

1850
01:21:08,940 --> 01:21:09,773
Right?
So the what happened at the end of the 

1851
01:21:12,270 --> 01:21:14,220
war,
was it the two different countries?

1852
01:21:14,910 --> 01:21:16,380
They became North End,
South Korea.

1853
01:21:16,410 --> 01:21:18,480
How's that?
I don't know the details of when was,

1854
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:19,793
I know it's probably fucked up the out 
when will North Korea was a founded 

1855
01:21:24,910 --> 01:21:27,630
because this was,
this is like the takeover.

1856
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:32,130
18 different cities destroyed out of 
him.

1857
01:21:32,140 --> 01:21:34,270
I knew he does.
They say 20 to 22.

1858
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:36,320
When was uh,
uh,

1859
01:21:36,340 --> 01:21:38,500
South Korea and one was North Korea 
formed.

1860
01:21:39,250 --> 01:21:40,083
And when,
when did it become like north and South 

1861
01:21:41,770 --> 01:21:42,580
Korea?
Do you know?

1862
01:21:42,580 --> 01:21:45,310
In the 50 sometimes.
So before that it was just all Korea.

1863
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:46,353
I'm not sure.
I don't know that much about why do I 

1864
01:21:47,891 --> 01:21:48,724
not know this?
All I know is we fire bombed 18 other 

1865
01:21:51,311 --> 01:21:52,090
cities.
Man.

1866
01:21:52,090 --> 01:21:55,000
That's devastating shit.
Yeah.

1867
01:21:55,220 --> 01:21:57,670
We talk about all these different,
uh,

1868
01:21:58,990 --> 01:22:01,120
well I think again,
back then,

1869
01:22:01,121 --> 01:22:01,954
man,

1870
01:22:03,030 --> 01:22:03,863
you,
you never look in North Korea has a 

1871
01:22:05,940 --> 01:22:08,340
history.
1945.

1872
01:22:09,010 --> 01:22:09,843
Oh,
the partition of Korea at the end of 

1873
01:22:11,431 --> 01:22:12,990
World War II.
Interesting.

1874
01:22:13,260 --> 01:22:17,130
The creation of the communist aligned 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

1875
01:22:17,670 --> 01:22:22,230
Okay.
Kim Il Song in 1950 the Korean War broke

1876
01:22:22,231 --> 01:22:27,231
out so they broke off in 1945 and water 
to be Communist.

1877
01:22:28,110 --> 01:22:30,330
Five years later we were going to war 
with them.

1878
01:22:31,770 --> 01:22:34,050
Man.
I don't know the history of it.

1879
01:22:34,290 --> 01:22:36,960
I'd be talking shit if I said I,
I had an opinion on it,

1880
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:41,340
but it sounds pretty sure I'm pretty,
I'm guessing that we,

1881
01:22:41,370 --> 01:22:44,010
we shouldn't have been up in there 
fucking mass.

1882
01:22:44,011 --> 01:22:44,844
That's less.
We were worried that he was going to 

1883
01:22:46,171 --> 01:22:47,004
become another Hitler and that it was 
going to become a just a further 

1884
01:22:50,161 --> 01:22:52,950
extension of World War II.
It was going to move on Maria,

1885
01:22:52,980 --> 01:22:53,813
history of world war two that is like we
don't really know the history of World 

1886
01:22:56,161 --> 01:22:56,970
War Two.

1887
01:22:56,970 --> 01:23:00,000
There's that mainstream history and then
there's the real shit.

1888
01:23:00,450 --> 01:23:01,283
Well,
you know,

1889
01:23:01,410 --> 01:23:06,410
world war one to both of them are just 
like world war one is very bizarre man.

1890
01:23:07,060 --> 01:23:07,893
When you go back and listen to Dan 
Carlin talk about World War One and you 

1891
01:23:10,661 --> 01:23:11,494
realize how recent that was,
where most of these guys were walking 

1892
01:23:13,241 --> 01:23:15,610
everywhere,
walking everywhere with guns,

1893
01:23:15,880 --> 01:23:16,713
you're like,
what?

1894
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:17,441
Like,
yeah,

1895
01:23:17,441 --> 01:23:18,700
that's what they did.
They walked,

1896
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:21,640
they walked with guns there,
walked across countries,

1897
01:23:21,700 --> 01:23:22,533
braveheart with guns.
It is ridiculous when you realize like 

1898
01:23:25,211 --> 01:23:27,850
that was a hundred years ago.
You go holy Shit.

1899
01:23:28,330 --> 01:23:31,480
Like what has happened and now instead 
of just,

1900
01:23:31,630 --> 01:23:33,610
you know,
50 years after that,

1901
01:23:33,611 --> 01:23:37,900
less less than 50 years after that there
napalming entire cities wiping out whole

1902
01:23:37,901 --> 01:23:38,734
cities like the,
the ability that where it used to be at 

1903
01:23:41,380 --> 01:23:42,213
like cannons and shit,
the Ed to move and push him closer and 

1904
01:23:45,101 --> 01:23:45,934
closer to people.

1905
01:23:45,940 --> 01:23:49,540
The difference between that and being 
able to drop shit out planes on people's

1906
01:23:49,541 --> 01:23:50,680
heads,
drones now,

1907
01:23:50,750 --> 01:23:53,800
not even crazy guys.
They got a con just she took continental

1908
01:23:53,801 --> 01:23:54,634
ballistic missiles,
missiles that are pointed at Russia and 

1909
01:23:57,791 --> 01:23:59,980
Russia's got him pointed at us and we 
just go,

1910
01:23:59,981 --> 01:24:00,490
yeah,
yeah.

1911
01:24:00,490 --> 01:24:04,030
That's where like the fucking Hatfield's
and the Mccoy's just stand at the barrel

1912
01:24:04,031 --> 01:24:06,700
of Martin,
Sam Moore and Ralph Lauren.

1913
01:24:06,701 --> 01:24:09,980
Ralph sheep dog and the Coyote.
Yeah,

1914
01:24:11,670 --> 01:24:14,590
old school reference morning Ralph 
Lauren,

1915
01:24:14,591 --> 01:24:15,424
Ralph,
they would punch in and they beat the 

1916
01:24:16,601 --> 01:24:17,434
fuck the sheepdog.
Beat the fuck out of the coyote all day 

1917
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:20,313
long.
At the end they would punch out and 

1918
01:24:20,741 --> 01:24:22,630
leave through that reus around there.
What was the,

1919
01:24:22,631 --> 01:24:25,330
a rooster is racist as fuck if you're 
not bro,

1920
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:26,913
come here,
boy.

1921
01:24:27,220 --> 01:24:29,830
Fuck corn.
Corn was racist.

1922
01:24:30,100 --> 01:24:31,060
What's your racist?
Yeah,

1923
01:24:31,061 --> 01:24:33,460
if you listen to how I say it,
I said come here boy.

1924
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:35,800
And he kept doing that,
but he was talking to chickens.

1925
01:24:35,830 --> 01:24:38,490
Now he would say some racist shit.
He was talking to chickens though,

1926
01:24:38,491 --> 01:24:39,011
Bro.
That,

1927
01:24:39,011 --> 01:24:40,420
but the way he wasn't even talking to 
people.

1928
01:24:40,421 --> 01:24:42,580
Racist.
Racist doesn't count with animals.

1929
01:24:42,970 --> 01:24:44,700
It doesn't.
We're all racist.

1930
01:24:44,701 --> 01:24:49,330
We prefer squirrels over rats.
You see a rather nice rat.

1931
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:50,193
You see a squirrel.
You don't mind your kid playing on the 

1932
01:24:51,071 --> 01:24:53,920
grass was grown on a tree near it.
I see.

1933
01:24:53,921 --> 01:24:54,870
I like her at,
yeah,

1934
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:56,290
but if you saw a squirrel,
all right.

1935
01:24:56,291 --> 01:24:58,090
If your kid was in the,
in the grass,

1936
01:24:58,180 --> 01:25:03,180
having a good time playing around with a
ball and then like a hundred yards away,

1937
01:25:03,580 --> 01:25:05,530
there was a tree with a squirrel kind of
school.

1938
01:25:05,940 --> 01:25:07,090
Fuck.
Any kind of squirrel.

1939
01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:09,490
The big bushy tail.
Cute little fellow.

1940
01:25:10,240 --> 01:25:11,980
Got a nut.
Yeah,

1941
01:25:11,981 --> 01:25:13,390
there's no problems.
There's no problems.

1942
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:15,400
Right?
If he was like 50 feet from Uk,

1943
01:25:15,401 --> 01:25:16,234
would you freak out?

1944
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:18,970
And I wouldn't be comfortable it and 
went to anything.

1945
01:25:19,060 --> 01:25:24,060
He wouldn't care nothing to babies.
But that was a rat.

1946
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:26,710
50 feet from your kid,
you'd freak the fuck out,

1947
01:25:26,711 --> 01:25:27,391
right?
Yeah.

1948
01:25:27,391 --> 01:25:32,080
Well cause rats are sisters because 
you're raised with that rat was clean.

1949
01:25:32,260 --> 01:25:34,270
What if that route was trying to better 
the rack community?

1950
01:25:34,271 --> 01:25:35,104
Would that,
what does that rat was a leader with 

1951
01:25:36,251 --> 01:25:38,590
their rat was the one rat trying to 
elevate the other rats.

1952
01:25:39,310 --> 01:25:43,040
They need to be eating garbage and 
cannibalize each other to be better.

1953
01:25:43,060 --> 01:25:45,400
We need to build homes.
We need to establish communities.

1954
01:25:45,401 --> 01:25:47,620
We need to teach people about rat traps.
I like,

1955
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:52,240
I like rats.
What am I supposed to survive on?

1956
01:25:52,720 --> 01:25:56,880
On rats and roaches.
But if we did that would fuck the,

1957
01:25:57,040 --> 01:26:00,160
the economy up when you all these 
assholes that want to kill coyotes.

1958
01:26:00,161 --> 01:26:01,750
Man,
if there wasn't for coyotes,

1959
01:26:01,751 --> 01:26:04,130
we'd have roaches or rats.
Least everywhere.

1960
01:26:04,190 --> 01:26:05,510
Rats.
Rats.

1961
01:26:05,540 --> 01:26:06,051
Fuck.
Yeah,

1962
01:26:06,051 --> 01:26:07,910
they do.
That's like the main diet.

1963
01:26:08,150 --> 01:26:10,280
Their main dies like rats and rabbits.
Chili's,

1964
01:26:10,340 --> 01:26:12,040
a bunch of coyotes to New York.
Man,

1965
01:26:12,920 --> 01:26:14,530
they're already there.
Coyotes.

1966
01:26:14,750 --> 01:26:18,290
Coyotes aren't like the city though.
The cities are in the city.

1967
01:26:18,680 --> 01:26:19,513
Dude,
coyotes are in every city in the 

1968
01:26:20,691 --> 01:26:21,524
country.
I just got done reading this book on 

1969
01:26:22,851 --> 01:26:23,930
him.
Coyote America.

1970
01:26:24,250 --> 01:26:26,930
Jamie wrote a whole book on Cody's crazy
book,

1971
01:26:26,931 --> 01:26:31,190
man by a guest that's coming on soon.
Coyote turned up in middle village,

1972
01:26:31,191 --> 01:26:33,770
Queens and April 27 there's generally 
seen as a freak.

1973
01:26:33,771 --> 01:26:36,560
It's inch in it,
but it wasn't even the first sighting of

1974
01:26:36,561 --> 01:26:40,820
2015 there's many coyotes that live in 
mass in um,

1975
01:26:41,090 --> 01:26:42,410
uh,
central park.

1976
01:26:42,620 --> 01:26:44,480
There's Kylie's it live in Queens.
Yeah.

1977
01:26:44,481 --> 01:26:46,300
They live all over Manhattan.
Well,

1978
01:26:46,310 --> 01:26:47,510
they're going where the food's at,
right?

1979
01:26:47,511 --> 01:26:49,730
They go everywhere.
They're all over the country.

1980
01:26:49,731 --> 01:26:53,180
There are small wolf that lives in every
single city,

1981
01:26:53,420 --> 01:26:56,870
every single state,
all over the country and do we kit,

1982
01:26:56,871 --> 01:26:58,430
we really don't kill him.

1983
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:00,380
We can't have tried to kill him.
They did.

1984
01:27:00,381 --> 01:27:05,381
The biggest mass effort to eradicate a 
species ever was on coyotes and wolves.

1985
01:27:05,930 --> 01:27:08,000
First Forrest Wolves,
which was successful.

1986
01:27:08,001 --> 01:27:09,800
And then coyotes.
Not only does it not work,

1987
01:27:10,010 --> 01:27:13,040
it has the opposite effect.
When you hear coyote screaming,

1988
01:27:13,580 --> 01:27:14,840
they're,
they're doing,

1989
01:27:14,841 --> 01:27:16,190
we'll call.
They're just like,

1990
01:27:16,191 --> 01:27:17,140
who's here?
Who's here?

1991
01:27:17,310 --> 01:27:18,143
Oh No.
Yeah,

1992
01:27:18,220 --> 01:27:19,053
they're trying to find out who's in 
attendance right after the attendance 

1993
01:27:22,851 --> 01:27:25,220
calls over if ones missing or two's 
missing up.

1994
01:27:25,221 --> 01:27:28,910
So they think someone's dead or gone.
The female has more babies.

1995
01:27:29,420 --> 01:27:33,290
So the female will go from having four 
puppies to having 10 or 15 and then they

1996
01:27:33,291 --> 01:27:34,124
also stretched the range out there.
Different than wolves in that wolves 

1997
01:27:36,561 --> 01:27:37,394
have to operate in packs.
Coyotes can operate as a singular or 

1998
01:27:40,491 --> 01:27:41,630
impacts.
Now,

1999
01:27:41,631 --> 01:27:43,700
what was a,
okay roll call and then,

2000
01:27:43,730 --> 01:27:45,410
oh,
someone was really attendance.

2001
01:27:45,470 --> 01:27:48,130
And then what happens?
The Mama starts making more babies.

2002
01:27:48,131 --> 01:27:49,910
They're missing.
So if someone's missing,

2003
01:27:49,911 --> 01:27:52,520
say if they have a pack,
the pack is like eight coyotes,

2004
01:27:52,610 --> 01:27:54,530
but one coyote gets jacked by a mountain
lion.

2005
01:27:54,950 --> 01:27:55,783
They yell out.
And when they find out that that kid is 

2006
01:27:57,801 --> 01:27:58,634
missing,
the females say we need to make more 

2007
01:27:59,991 --> 01:28:02,690
babies and it's like to keep their 
species alive,

2008
01:28:02,870 --> 01:28:05,450
they produce more offspring.
So they'll go from having,

2009
01:28:05,451 --> 01:28:06,980
so they have sex ups?
No,

2010
01:28:06,981 --> 01:28:07,221
no,
no.

2011
01:28:07,221 --> 01:28:08,054
Their pups or larger groups.
So from four pups to having like 10 to 

2012
01:28:11,241 --> 01:28:15,500
13 it's like the body produces more 
babies.

2013
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:17,840
Yeah.
So the smarter than the wolves.

2014
01:28:17,900 --> 01:28:19,940
Oh yeah dude,
they're just smaller.

2015
01:28:20,140 --> 01:28:22,850
Did there,
they're fucking ridiculously smart.

2016
01:28:22,870 --> 01:28:23,703
They're,
they're sneaky and they're smart enough 

2017
01:28:24,981 --> 01:28:27,380
to know to not attack humans.
Yeah.

2018
01:28:27,470 --> 01:28:29,960
We'd leave them alone if we don't attack
them.

2019
01:28:30,100 --> 01:28:30,933
You don't,
you don't hear a lot of coyote attacks 

2020
01:28:32,210 --> 01:28:34,360
on dogs and shit around.

2021
01:28:34,370 --> 01:28:35,780
It's cause they don't attack.
They just happen.

2022
01:28:35,781 --> 01:28:36,614
Not Be,
be scared if they weren't as good as 

2023
01:28:38,061 --> 01:28:39,500
humans at attack,
that'd be gone.

2024
01:28:39,530 --> 01:28:41,050
This professor that,
uh,

2025
01:28:41,270 --> 01:28:43,070
I've got coming on the floor,
the podcast,

2026
01:28:43,071 --> 01:28:45,140
Dan Flores,
who wrote that book,

2027
01:28:45,141 --> 01:28:45,974
Coyote America,
what he said is that coyotes when like 

2028
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:52,880
the,
the like a couple of hundred years ago,

2029
01:28:53,030 --> 01:28:56,780
like they were only in the west coast 
and as people push them away,

2030
01:28:57,080 --> 01:28:57,913
they started establishing new 
territories like us making cities and 

2031
01:29:01,411 --> 01:29:02,244
going after them,
made them spread out across the whole 

2032
01:29:05,341 --> 01:29:07,680
country.
She's us like an,

2033
01:29:07,740 --> 01:29:08,573
it's,
there's people that don't understand 

2034
01:29:09,661 --> 01:29:10,494
this.
Like he got approached by this one 

2035
01:29:11,281 --> 01:29:12,750
because people know he's a coyote 
expert.

2036
01:29:12,900 --> 01:29:17,010
You got approached by these people that 
were doing this coyote a rescue mission.

2037
01:29:17,011 --> 01:29:21,000
Like we're here to save the coyotes,
the coyotes doing great.

2038
01:29:21,180 --> 01:29:24,810
Like you're here to save it,
save it from what they're everywhere.

2039
01:29:24,900 --> 01:29:25,733
Like they literally have populated 
quietly and sneakily the entire country 

2040
01:29:29,970 --> 01:29:30,803
and the efforts,
all efforts to eradicate them failed 

2041
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:35,520
when they let me have it.
See when they have male wolves,

2042
01:29:35,700 --> 01:29:36,533
they can cyanide like a horse.
They take a horse and they'll shoot a 

2043
01:29:39,541 --> 01:29:44,040
male wolf and then they take his balls 
and his dick and they rub is sent in his

2044
01:29:44,041 --> 01:29:44,874
glands all over this,
this animal so that the other wolves 

2045
01:29:48,271 --> 01:29:51,990
recognize that he's been there.
So they think it's safe to eat.

2046
01:29:52,110 --> 01:29:56,130
So they start eating this horse that's 
been cyanide and then they would all die

2047
01:29:56,250 --> 01:29:57,600
and so they would pop.
They would,

2048
01:29:57,630 --> 01:30:02,040
they would attack these packs of wolves 
that way they would shoot the mail,

2049
01:30:02,130 --> 01:30:03,870
they would take his sand,
put on this meat,

2050
01:30:03,900 --> 01:30:05,070
take a horse,
shoot the horse,

2051
01:30:05,190 --> 01:30:06,023
injecting with cyanide immediately.
So it went through his entire nervous 

2052
01:30:08,971 --> 01:30:11,280
system where it's not just our 
circulation system.

2053
01:30:11,490 --> 01:30:13,560
And so all the meat would be poisoned.
And they did that.

2054
01:30:13,561 --> 01:30:17,070
And they eradicated walls throughout the
entire west coast until they brought him

2055
01:30:17,071 --> 01:30:19,800
back into yellowstone in the 1990s there
were like virtually

2056
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:21,420
actually gone.
But yes.

2057
01:30:21,421 --> 01:30:24,030
Animal too.
I was reading the article that they're,

2058
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:24,953
they're thinking about building a bridge
over the four oh five and I didn't know 

2059
01:30:27,631 --> 01:30:29,250
this.
There's fucking mountain lines.

2060
01:30:29,420 --> 01:30:30,180
Oh,
you can't depend,

2061
01:30:30,180 --> 01:30:31,013
you can't it.
But someone hit one in a car because 

2062
01:30:33,511 --> 01:30:34,344
they're trying to crossover,
trying to cross the four oh five well 

2063
01:30:37,701 --> 01:30:38,534
that problem.
And they want to build a little ramp 

2064
01:30:40,390 --> 01:30:42,000
during almost a land.
Um,

2065
01:30:42,110 --> 01:30:44,970
they're in like a land island,
like around the Malibu area.

2066
01:30:45,030 --> 01:30:46,080
Yeah.
That's what they're trying to do.

2067
01:30:46,710 --> 01:30:50,670
Just to keep the big monsters live.
Yeah.

2068
01:30:50,671 --> 01:30:54,540
One of them killed 11 alpacas in a goat 
in Malibu.

2069
01:30:54,630 --> 01:30:57,630
Just a couple of weeks ago,
they put a depredation order on it.

2070
01:30:57,631 --> 01:30:58,464
They were going to kill it,
but this lady who owned the farm got so 

2071
01:31:00,871 --> 01:31:03,660
much hate mail after they said they were
going to kill the mountain line,

2072
01:31:03,661 --> 01:31:04,590
that she changed her mind.

2073
01:31:04,590 --> 01:31:05,423
She didn't want to kill it because 
mental mind doing mountain land shit 

2074
01:31:07,320 --> 01:31:09,240
cause she has a farm up there.
That's her living.

2075
01:31:09,241 --> 01:31:10,074
It's making these Alpacas and this thing
jacked 11 which you sign up for a lady 

2076
01:31:14,370 --> 01:31:15,203
in a way.
Right.

2077
01:31:15,450 --> 01:31:19,440
But if it's killing your food and 
killing your,

2078
01:31:19,470 --> 01:31:20,303
your you're living.
That's why you make a living is by 

2079
01:31:21,841 --> 01:31:23,230
selling.
Alpacas are doing,

2080
01:31:23,340 --> 01:31:24,173
I don't know what the fuck is an Alpaca.
It's like what the fuck's hustle 

2081
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:29,370
hustling llamas when Alan can do with 
them,

2082
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:32,780
rent them to rich kids' birthday 
parties.

2083
01:31:33,180 --> 01:31:37,560
The fuck do you do with a Lama in Malibu
Llamas just sweating their asses off.

2084
01:31:37,890 --> 01:31:40,320
There was a dude who own the common 
connection that had llamas,

2085
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:43,980
had llamas living in his yard.
Alpaca is a speech they spit to.

2086
01:31:44,010 --> 01:31:45,380
They split like a motherfucker.
Yeah,

2087
01:31:45,480 --> 01:31:48,170
it's a species of South American 
Kamlish.

2088
01:31:48,210 --> 01:31:51,360
It's a camel.
It resembles a small Lama in appearance.

2089
01:31:51,361 --> 01:31:53,910
There are two breeds of Alpaca.
Wow.

2090
01:31:53,940 --> 01:31:56,100
So anyway,
this lion in one day,

2091
01:31:56,590 --> 01:31:57,423
Jack,
Jack 11 of these things and just left 

2092
01:31:59,591 --> 01:32:00,150
him there and

2093
01:32:00,150 --> 01:32:01,030
they're big.
Oh,

2094
01:32:01,031 --> 01:32:02,160
didn't eat it.
Just kill.

2095
01:32:02,180 --> 01:32:03,700
He just had a good old time killing 
them.

2096
01:32:04,240 --> 01:32:05,530
Yeah.
You got to get rid of that one.

2097
01:32:05,710 --> 01:32:06,543
Yeah.
Is there a problem with wolves and 

2098
01:32:07,820 --> 01:32:10,770
hunters hunters or did they,

2099
01:32:10,870 --> 01:32:11,703
they certainly would.
I had a friend who was cornered by 

2100
01:32:13,481 --> 01:32:14,314
wolves.
They tried to take his elk and he wound 

2101
01:32:16,031 --> 01:32:16,864
up,
they went up killing I think two or 

2102
01:32:18,131 --> 01:32:19,540
three wolves.
I think they killed three,

2103
01:32:19,541 --> 01:32:21,970
three wolves.
I would have told us the story again.

2104
01:32:21,971 --> 01:32:24,250
He had one friend with a rifle and him 
with a bow.

2105
01:32:24,251 --> 01:32:25,084
He killed two of them with a bow and the
guy with them killed one of them with a 

2106
01:32:27,371 --> 01:32:28,204
rifle and they were surrounding them and
they were trying to get the elk away 

2107
01:32:30,971 --> 01:32:31,850
from him.
They had shot him.

2108
01:32:32,380 --> 01:32:34,000
They fucked up.
They didn't know that.

2109
01:32:34,001 --> 01:32:37,450
They were like in the wolves' Den.
It was like that fucking the gray movie.

2110
01:32:37,480 --> 01:32:41,890
Like they shot this elk like right near 
the wolves' den and the wolves like,

2111
01:32:41,891 --> 01:32:42,830
yeah,
we'll take that dude.

2112
01:32:42,940 --> 01:32:44,080
Natural Shit.
Yeah.

2113
01:32:44,081 --> 01:32:47,350
And they surrounded these dudes and uh,
started rushing them.

2114
01:32:47,560 --> 01:32:49,110
Like really?
It's a crazy car.

2115
01:32:49,111 --> 01:32:51,130
Three storing.
And then the other ones took off.

2116
01:32:51,131 --> 01:32:51,970
They were like,
fuck this.

2117
01:32:52,210 --> 01:32:54,460
The gun I think probably scare them.
They're like,

2118
01:32:54,461 --> 01:32:55,960
oh this,
these mother fuckers have guns.

2119
01:32:56,040 --> 01:32:58,690
And they did their call.
They did their attendance called,

2120
01:32:59,740 --> 01:33:01,520
and they were surrounding them,
but they were,

2121
01:33:01,570 --> 01:33:03,610
the wolves must've realized,
Oh shit,

2122
01:33:03,611 --> 01:33:06,220
they killed two of us.
I think there's two that are gone.

2123
01:33:06,370 --> 01:33:09,820
And then the killed a third and then 
like that's it now.

2124
01:33:09,821 --> 01:33:10,654
He said he was,
he had the Alpha male in his sight and 

2125
01:33:12,821 --> 01:33:15,160
he had his bow drawn back and the wolf 
took off running.

2126
01:33:15,490 --> 01:33:17,530
And when the wolf took off running,
the rest of the pack went to,

2127
01:33:17,531 --> 01:33:18,341
they were like,
fuck this.

2128
01:33:18,341 --> 01:33:20,210
They're lucky they had a gun and not 
just those bones.

2129
01:33:20,460 --> 01:33:22,450
So the patch.
So lucky.

2130
01:33:22,480 --> 01:33:23,313
Not only that lucky,
it's not just one dude with a bow and 

2131
01:33:24,731 --> 01:33:25,564
arrow.
Like if you didn't have that guy with a 

2132
01:33:26,031 --> 01:33:26,864
fun with them

2133
01:33:27,340 --> 01:33:30,790
would have been fucked.
You know what's strange is killer whales

2134
01:33:30,791 --> 01:33:33,430
have no problem killing other dolphins 
and other whales.

2135
01:33:33,431 --> 01:33:37,480
They go after and hunt them.
How come they don't go after humans like

2136
01:33:37,481 --> 01:33:37,751
that?
Oh,

2137
01:33:37,751 --> 01:33:41,120
they have have they only videos but only
in seaworld?

2138
01:33:42,160 --> 01:33:43,280
Forget about seaworld.
No,

2139
01:33:43,540 --> 01:33:45,940
he had on my regular one ocean when the 
wild,

2140
01:33:45,970 --> 01:33:47,890
I've never heard of that.
I grabbed a lady and she said,

2141
01:33:47,920 --> 01:33:50,020
see Ya Zinc.
No,

2142
01:33:50,021 --> 01:33:50,351
no,
no,

2143
01:33:50,351 --> 01:33:52,820
no shaming it have a story that happened
in seaworld.

2144
01:33:52,900 --> 01:33:53,500
No,
no.

2145
01:33:53,500 --> 01:33:55,180
I'm positive.
This is in the ocean.

2146
01:33:55,420 --> 01:33:59,230
He grabbed the lady or the guy by the 
leg and just fucking kills off.

2147
01:33:59,290 --> 01:34:00,580
Kills Him.
Takes off.

2148
01:34:01,300 --> 01:34:02,133
But one of the,
how often know how many reports are 

2149
01:34:04,151 --> 01:34:09,151
there of killer whales attacking humans?
I mean is there do this almost none.

2150
01:34:09,190 --> 01:34:12,280
They go after dolphins and other way it 
was like getting shit.

2151
01:34:12,340 --> 01:34:13,810
They have fun.
Great whites too.

2152
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:14,673
Yeah,
they have no fun.

2153
01:34:14,680 --> 01:34:17,170
They have fun with it.
They go after they're mammals.

2154
01:34:17,171 --> 01:34:18,310
So why wouldn't the,
oh no,

2155
01:34:18,311 --> 01:34:21,440
humans are they that smart to know 
offense to man,

2156
01:34:21,460 --> 01:34:23,380
they like coyotes.
Are they like how it is like,

2157
01:34:23,381 --> 01:34:25,360
you know what?
If we fuck with humans,

2158
01:34:25,361 --> 01:34:26,194
they're going to come after us do.
Are they smart enough to know not to 

2159
01:34:28,181 --> 01:34:30,940
fuck with us or are they being,
is it like a spiritual thing?

2160
01:34:30,941 --> 01:34:32,570
What is it?
There's a bogus story

2161
01:34:32,570 --> 01:34:34,820
that I read online that I repeated on 
the podcast for.

2162
01:34:34,821 --> 01:34:36,260
I looked it up,
but the book,

2163
01:34:36,620 --> 01:34:41,130
the book is that I'm pretty sure Adam 
Carolla told me or some of them I don't,

2164
01:34:41,131 --> 01:34:45,320
I don't remember where I got it from,
but the bogus story was that before,

2165
01:34:45,380 --> 01:34:46,970
I don't think Adam Kroll believes this,
by the way,

2166
01:34:47,210 --> 01:34:50,600
before World War Two they used to attack
us,

2167
01:34:50,990 --> 01:34:51,823
but then once a,
they used to do target practice with 

2168
01:34:54,771 --> 01:34:57,680
them from planes.
Killer whale stopped us.

2169
01:34:57,710 --> 01:34:58,010
Turned out

2170
01:34:58,010 --> 01:35:00,590
to not be a true story at all.
But that's what a killer story.

2171
01:35:00,610 --> 01:35:01,970
What a great story it'd be if it was 
true.

2172
01:35:01,971 --> 01:35:04,160
It sounds like some place you used to 
fuck with us and they're like,

2173
01:35:04,190 --> 01:35:05,023
oh,
check this out.

2174
01:35:07,990 --> 01:35:10,340
And they're like,
yeah,

2175
01:35:11,680 --> 01:35:14,030
we'll help you guys fall in the water.
Pull you out.

2176
01:35:14,031 --> 01:35:15,620
Just please stop.
Stop that.

2177
01:35:16,140 --> 01:35:17,870
Yeah,
we could work together.

2178
01:35:18,190 --> 01:35:19,820
Yeah.
Killer whales are gnarly,

2179
01:35:19,821 --> 01:35:20,930
man.
What's up with that?

2180
01:35:20,931 --> 01:35:25,340
The gnarliest or maybe if you found out 
you see that there's a big cover.

2181
01:35:25,341 --> 01:35:28,190
I've seen it kill humans all the time.
I think it's a guy in a,

2182
01:35:28,390 --> 01:35:29,450
in a,
in a pond.

2183
01:35:29,900 --> 01:35:31,250
In the tank.
The exception,

2184
01:35:31,251 --> 01:35:32,084
like obviously seal hunt people,
but grab this fucking lady by the ankle 

2185
01:35:34,430 --> 01:35:35,263
was like,
ew,

2186
01:35:35,870 --> 01:35:37,670
I don't know about that man.
I never heard that.

2187
01:35:37,671 --> 01:35:39,470
I'd like to see.
Just see that at the library.

2188
01:35:41,250 --> 01:35:43,340
What do you get your news?
Where do you get your hands,

2189
01:35:43,810 --> 01:35:44,660
Bro?
Hey Bro.

2190
01:35:44,661 --> 01:35:47,390
Kellen sent me that.
Is there a youtube video about it?

2191
01:35:47,391 --> 01:35:49,720
Yes or no?
Yeah.

2192
01:35:50,250 --> 01:35:52,190
Killer.
I found one fake one.

2193
01:35:52,400 --> 01:35:56,000
I see one from seaworld.
There's one where uh,

2194
01:35:56,190 --> 01:35:58,970
a Japanese whaling crew was eaten alive 
by killer whales.

2195
01:35:59,570 --> 01:36:00,490
Thanks.
Cake.

2196
01:36:00,690 --> 01:36:03,500
That's not a video.
It just says like a story.

2197
01:36:04,430 --> 01:36:05,263
What was the story?
Japanese crew was eaten alive by killer 

2198
01:36:08,361 --> 01:36:09,194
whales.
That's one of those fucking fake news 

2199
01:36:10,821 --> 01:36:11,654
stories.
You hear that fake news thing about up 

2200
01:36:13,310 --> 01:36:17,450
Pakistan was like there literally were 
like ready to go to war with,

2201
01:36:17,451 --> 01:36:18,650
uh,
what was the,

2202
01:36:18,740 --> 01:36:22,910
I tweeted earlier today,
someone believes some fake news story.

2203
01:36:22,940 --> 01:36:26,180
I'm not believing this store.
There's other news things on there like,

2204
01:36:26,181 --> 01:36:29,100
so it's a fake news story about fake 
news jacking off for it.

2205
01:36:29,140 --> 01:36:29,451
But no,
no,

2206
01:36:29,451 --> 01:36:31,310
no.
That was nail from the same site.

2207
01:36:31,310 --> 01:36:32,143
Now this is not from Sam,
but the one that I tweeted earlier 

2208
01:36:33,771 --> 01:36:35,450
today,
I saw that that was a fake news story.

2209
01:36:35,451 --> 01:36:36,070
I'll pull that up.
Right,

2210
01:36:36,070 --> 01:36:37,100
right.
That was about,

2211
01:36:37,160 --> 01:36:39,860
but it was on cnn about a fake news 
story.

2212
01:36:40,310 --> 01:36:41,960
Right.
And then they bought into it or about,

2213
01:36:41,980 --> 01:36:42,813
someone bought into it with this story 
about the war of the potential for war 

2214
01:36:47,721 --> 01:36:50,780
wasn't fake,
wasn't gonna stay administer issues just

2215
01:36:50,960 --> 01:36:52,760
popped up.
I put it up there warning.

2216
01:36:52,920 --> 01:36:54,800
It's real after being tricked by fake 
news.

2217
01:36:54,910 --> 01:36:56,690
Right.
But that's what I was talking about.

2218
01:36:56,710 --> 01:36:57,590
Yeah.
So that's real,

2219
01:36:57,591 --> 01:36:59,060
right?
That's not fake news.

2220
01:36:59,090 --> 01:37:01,190
The ultimate trolling.
That's that dude.

2221
01:37:01,191 --> 01:37:03,260
When they're talking about fake news 
site,

2222
01:37:03,290 --> 01:37:06,200
that's the fake shit.
This shit.

2223
01:37:06,500 --> 01:37:07,730
Okay,
well either way.

2224
01:37:07,780 --> 01:37:08,780
Either way.
Whoever,

2225
01:37:08,781 --> 01:37:12,200
whoever wrote fake news that they put 
what?

2226
01:37:12,201 --> 01:37:14,870
First of all,
shitty being tricked by fake news site.

2227
01:37:14,870 --> 01:37:15,703
They keep putting that out there cause 
they're gonna censor real shit and it's 

2228
01:37:19,191 --> 01:37:20,024
going to be government state run.
They're going China style did they 

2229
01:37:22,041 --> 01:37:23,620
already doing?
I'm trying to scroll up for a second.

2230
01:37:23,630 --> 01:37:25,300
You anything you want in China?
No doubt.

2231
01:37:25,310 --> 01:37:27,170
And I'm sorry down.
You got to train.

2232
01:37:27,171 --> 01:37:28,700
Anybody go to China.
But guess what?

2233
01:37:28,701 --> 01:37:29,534
You can't watch regular youtube.
Why don't they have a space between 

2234
01:37:31,731 --> 01:37:35,330
Pakistans and defense minister?
This is fucking CNN.

2235
01:37:35,510 --> 01:37:36,343
How about you put a goddamn space in 
between your words is the Shitty Lazy 

2236
01:37:39,970 --> 01:37:40,803
Editors,
early men.

2237
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:43,740
What does it Jamie?
This is the telegraph.co.

2238
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:44,593
Dot.
UK.

2239
01:37:44,690 --> 01:37:45,231
Oh,
okay.

2240
01:37:45,231 --> 01:37:47,090
This one is,
so what's the CNN one?

2241
01:37:48,980 --> 01:37:51,960
There was a cnn one that I tweeted.
This was not exactly what a tween,

2242
01:37:51,961 --> 01:37:54,890
but either way it's the whole thing is 
very bizarre.

2243
01:37:55,470 --> 01:37:56,010
Homeboy got

2244
01:37:56,010 --> 01:37:58,140
trolled and was about to sit down.
It's like a war.

2245
01:37:58,170 --> 01:38:00,150
We'll take you to war.
Bitch is right here.

2246
01:38:02,190 --> 01:38:04,230
Yeah.
There's a CNN article duped by fake news

2247
01:38:04,231 --> 01:38:05,064
story.
Pakistani mini administer threatens 

2248
01:38:06,990 --> 01:38:11,390
nuclear war with Israel.
What they're trying to do is put out,

2249
01:38:11,490 --> 01:38:12,323
uh,
at scare people with fake news sites so 

2250
01:38:15,511 --> 01:38:16,920
that they could go in there and have a 
reason,

2251
01:38:16,921 --> 01:38:18,450
a sensor and everyone's going to go,
yeah,

2252
01:38:18,630 --> 01:38:21,360
fuck thick new sites.
Let's fucking sensor.

2253
01:38:21,740 --> 01:38:22,860
Okay,
you don't get emotional.

2254
01:38:22,861 --> 01:38:23,694
Let's just communicate.
Anytime we see something like that in 

2255
01:38:26,371 --> 01:38:28,910
quotes that go fake new sec,
tricked by fake news,

2256
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:31,410
people are going to go,
yes,

2257
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:34,590
it's fake on facebook and see that chip.
It's honey dick.

2258
01:38:34,591 --> 01:38:36,360
Why Honey Dick in your face?
Right?

2259
01:38:36,361 --> 01:38:37,081
But here's the thing.
Well,

2260
01:38:37,081 --> 01:38:37,914
who's making these fake news sites and 
it wouldn't it be in the best interest 

2261
01:38:40,081 --> 01:38:42,450
of the government to make fake news 
sites of their own?

2262
01:38:42,770 --> 01:38:46,860
So they all have a reason to not have 
fake news sites around.

2263
01:38:50,460 --> 01:38:51,293
But do you think they could literally 
stop people from putting stuff out on 

2264
01:38:53,971 --> 01:38:54,721
the Internet?
I mean,

2265
01:38:54,721 --> 01:38:55,554
if that's the ultimate goal,
now what they're doing is they're going 

2266
01:38:57,211 --> 01:38:58,610
to censor the top,
uh,

2267
01:38:58,650 --> 01:39:01,410
alternative media,
new sites that going after them.

2268
01:39:01,560 --> 01:39:04,500
That's the target.
This is a big trick saying like CNN,

2269
01:39:05,180 --> 01:39:05,770
no,
no,

2270
01:39:05,770 --> 01:39:06,190
no,
no,

2271
01:39:06,190 --> 01:39:06,600
no,
no.

2272
01:39:06,600 --> 01:39:08,270
Like breitbart or,
yeah,

2273
01:39:08,271 --> 01:39:10,830
like drudge,
infowars wars.

2274
01:39:10,920 --> 01:39:14,670
They're putting out the real shit,
but they got control the media.

2275
01:39:14,790 --> 01:39:15,601
So they're saying,
oh,

2276
01:39:15,601 --> 01:39:16,434
that's fake news.
So that creating a fake news problem 

2277
01:39:20,100 --> 01:39:23,460
that isn't there so that that can go in 
and sensor the real shit.

2278
01:39:23,610 --> 01:39:26,340
It's a fucking trick.
If you see it on CNN,

2279
01:39:26,430 --> 01:39:29,760
I called it every headline being tricked
by fake news.

2280
01:39:29,850 --> 01:39:31,050
They're getting everyone going.
Yeah.

2281
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:32,160
Thick,
new sucks.

2282
01:39:32,190 --> 01:39:33,150
Fuck that.
You know?

2283
01:39:33,151 --> 01:39:33,871
Then they're going,
yeah,

2284
01:39:33,871 --> 01:39:34,411
it does.
Right?

2285
01:39:34,411 --> 01:39:35,880
Look,
here's another fake news site,

2286
01:39:36,030 --> 01:39:36,863
and people are being tricked and doing 
all this crazy shit and walking into 

2287
01:39:38,790 --> 01:39:40,560
pizza places with fucking machine guns.

2288
01:39:40,840 --> 01:39:42,120
They yell it,
Stop Fake News.

2289
01:39:42,121 --> 01:39:43,530
What are we gonna to do?
Let's just sign it.

2290
01:39:43,620 --> 01:39:44,690
Boom.
They're going to,

2291
01:39:45,020 --> 01:39:46,440
they're going China style.
They're gonna.

2292
01:39:46,680 --> 01:39:48,980
They're going to censor.
The Internet isn't going to work.

2293
01:39:49,570 --> 01:39:52,590
They're going to blacklist you.
If you're a new site that's credible and

2294
01:39:52,591 --> 01:39:54,390
you're fucking with the agenda,
boom,

2295
01:39:54,391 --> 01:39:55,230
they're going to go,
hey,

2296
01:39:55,500 --> 01:39:56,550
that's fake,
dude,

2297
01:39:56,551 --> 01:39:57,384
you're off.
That's what there were in the middle of 

2298
01:39:58,801 --> 01:39:59,634
that.
Right now we're being assaulted with 

2299
01:40:01,201 --> 01:40:02,034
people being tricked by fake news.
When have you been tricked by fucking 

2300
01:40:04,771 --> 01:40:06,990
fake and offices?
They're not tricking me.

2301
01:40:08,030 --> 01:40:08,863
You settle down.
Anybody can be tricked by fake news for 

2302
01:40:10,831 --> 01:40:13,120
sure.
They can be and if the the,

2303
01:40:13,170 --> 01:40:14,003
the question is who's actually doing it?
Is the government doing it so they can 

2304
01:40:16,981 --> 01:40:21,480
crack down on alternative controls 
saying like Wiki leaks or anybody that's

2305
01:40:21,481 --> 01:40:22,314
putting out stuff that doesn't agree 
with her agenda or is there a real 

2306
01:40:25,801 --> 01:40:26,370
issue?

2307
01:40:26,370 --> 01:40:28,470
There's a real issue and that,
that's what I say.

2308
01:40:28,500 --> 01:40:30,000
I say I say there's bulk.
Correct.

2309
01:40:30,150 --> 01:40:33,990
I say the government for sure would 
benefit from there being less sources of

2310
01:40:33,991 --> 01:40:34,824
news and more that they can control and 
being able to put the wraps on someone 

2311
01:40:37,531 --> 01:40:39,690
like Edward Snowden and not allow that 
to happen.

2312
01:40:39,691 --> 01:40:41,460
For sure.
They would definitely benefit from that,

2313
01:40:41,640 --> 01:40:45,270
but there's also a bunch of people 
writing some fake articles and they'd do

2314
01:40:45,271 --> 01:40:46,104
it for profit.
They do it for clicks is there was one 

2315
01:40:48,050 --> 01:40:49,080
shut up.
He was,

2316
01:40:49,081 --> 01:40:51,330
yes.
He interviewed him and he was doing some

2317
01:40:51,690 --> 01:40:52,620
don't.
Wow Eddie,

2318
01:40:52,621 --> 01:40:54,160
please just be BHP

2319
01:40:54,160 --> 01:40:55,690
rational.
We've talking about stuff.

2320
01:40:55,691 --> 01:40:57,540
We're not disagreeing with you.
They'll say you.

2321
01:40:57,820 --> 01:40:58,653
We're saying it's all the above.
Like I'm saying that people get paid to 

2322
01:41:02,501 --> 01:41:03,334
write fake news.
I'm saying they get money from ad 

2323
01:41:05,561 --> 01:41:07,780
clicks.
They can make 10 $13,000

2324
01:41:07,781 --> 01:41:08,614
a month.
They interviewed this dude who did it 

2325
01:41:10,001 --> 01:41:11,290
and he started getting out of control 
with it.

2326
01:41:11,291 --> 01:41:12,124
He did it to troll Republican people and
then you realize how much ad sends he 

2327
01:41:14,771 --> 01:41:18,940
can make from doing that and he's making
a fucking sizeable chunk of money,

2328
01:41:19,450 --> 01:41:20,283
so there's those guys,
but then there's also for sure there 

2329
01:41:23,051 --> 01:41:25,270
would be government agencies that would 
almost be,

2330
01:41:25,480 --> 01:41:28,600
it would be their responsibility to 
control information.

2331
01:41:28,810 --> 01:41:30,430
Like if you wanted to control 
information,

2332
01:41:30,431 --> 01:41:33,820
one of the best ways to do it would be 
put out disinformation cloud.

2333
01:41:33,821 --> 01:41:34,654
The story that's subterfuge.
That's been going on in the CIA and the 

2334
01:41:38,741 --> 01:41:39,574
NSA and this been going on and all of 
these like secretive intelligence 

2335
01:41:43,181 --> 01:41:45,070
community groups,
they do that forever.

2336
01:41:45,070 --> 01:41:45,903
They like if you,
if you pay attention to what we 

2337
01:41:47,291 --> 01:41:50,290
absolutely know about how they engage 
with the enemy,

2338
01:41:50,500 --> 01:41:53,680
they use every tactic.
They don't not use deception.

2339
01:41:53,681 --> 01:41:54,514
They don't not use propaganda.
The the 450 million plus they spent on 

2340
01:41:58,631 --> 01:41:59,464
those fake terrorist videos to know it,
but they also had in their mind a 

2341
01:42:04,690 --> 01:42:07,090
legitimate reason for doing it.
That's what they say.

2342
01:42:07,140 --> 01:42:08,110
Because you're right,
you're right.

2343
01:42:08,470 --> 01:42:09,520
It could be,
but Eddie,

2344
01:42:09,521 --> 01:42:11,360
but it could be both.
See their,

2345
01:42:11,380 --> 01:42:13,720
their legitimate reason is they have a 
real player.

2346
01:42:13,721 --> 01:42:15,850
This is how you watch those videos or 
it's in a real player.

2347
01:42:16,060 --> 01:42:17,560
When you click into a real player,
it,

2348
01:42:17,650 --> 01:42:20,110
it checks your Ip.
It knows your Ip,

2349
01:42:20,111 --> 01:42:22,690
so could figure out where you're coming 
from so they can pocket.

2350
01:42:22,990 --> 01:42:23,823
If they could target pockets of people 
in certain terrorist rich parts of the 

2351
01:42:27,011 --> 01:42:29,200
world where they knew that there was a 
bunch of uh,

2352
01:42:29,230 --> 01:42:30,670
isis people or what have you.

2353
01:42:30,820 --> 01:42:31,653
If they put out some recruitment video 
and they can find that there's a lot of 

2354
01:42:34,031 --> 01:42:35,920
people that are watching it in certain 
areas,

2355
01:42:36,130 --> 01:42:40,930
they can sort of in their mind 
triangulate where these terrorists could

2356
01:42:40,931 --> 01:42:41,770
be loved.
Idea.

2357
01:42:42,100 --> 01:42:44,140
It's the same I was reading Howard.
It's both end.

2358
01:42:44,141 --> 01:42:45,470
It's both.
It,

2359
01:42:45,550 --> 01:42:47,320
that's the cover story,
right?

2360
01:42:47,321 --> 01:42:48,400
But that,
but it is bold.

2361
01:42:48,730 --> 01:42:51,430
Isis does exist.
There are bad people in the world.

2362
01:42:51,670 --> 01:42:54,400
There are terrorist in the world.
Kim John Owen is a real guy.

2363
01:42:54,670 --> 01:42:55,503
He is.
He is a dictator over his entire 

2364
01:42:56,801 --> 01:42:57,634
country.
There's a bunch of people in Isis that 

2365
01:42:59,201 --> 01:43:00,034
have fucking billions of dollars that 
are getting this money from is what I'm 

2366
01:43:03,461 --> 01:43:04,990
talking about.
They exist,

2367
01:43:04,991 --> 01:43:06,610
of course,
oil families.

2368
01:43:06,611 --> 01:43:08,430
There's a lot of those,
a lot of sources,

2369
01:43:08,530 --> 01:43:09,363
a lot of motherfuckers.
And when you see who they're being 

2370
01:43:11,201 --> 01:43:12,034
funded by,
you know like you ain't going to fall 

2371
01:43:13,601 --> 01:43:14,530
for that cover story.

2372
01:43:14,530 --> 01:43:16,870
That's all bullshit that they,
I don't think you're right.

2373
01:43:16,871 --> 01:43:18,760
I think it's both.
That's what I think.

2374
01:43:18,761 --> 01:43:22,330
I think everybody's going after it.
They're trying to stop by Esis,

2375
01:43:22,331 --> 01:43:23,164
man.
There's nobody trying to stop by isis 

2376
01:43:24,131 --> 01:43:25,540
that are encouraging it.
They're not.

2377
01:43:25,560 --> 01:43:26,890
They love it.
They need it.

2378
01:43:27,400 --> 01:43:28,233
I don't know if that's the case.
What does it say in case you didn't 

2379
01:43:29,831 --> 01:43:31,390
know?
The United States funds and arms,

2380
01:43:31,391 --> 01:43:35,020
terrorist groups like al Qaeda and Isis 
when it needs them to disrupt a country.

2381
01:43:35,021 --> 01:43:37,660
This is doctor Jill Stein who was 
running for president.

2382
01:43:37,661 --> 01:43:40,460
She said this the day of Christmas.
She doesn't give a fuck.

2383
01:43:40,640 --> 01:43:45,310
That bitch is roots thankless.
Woke as fuck.

2384
01:43:45,330 --> 01:43:46,060
She's,
whoa.

2385
01:43:46,060 --> 01:43:49,720
That's what I'm talking about.
Doctors chills when you know this and it

2386
01:43:49,721 --> 01:43:50,950
makes sense.
You could follow the,

2387
01:43:51,230 --> 01:43:51,771
you're like,
okay,

2388
01:43:51,771 --> 01:43:52,100
totally

2389
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:53,600
makes sense.
A criminals is,

2390
01:43:53,750 --> 01:43:54,800
oh yeah,
it makes sense.

2391
01:43:54,801 --> 01:43:56,570
Criminals do this kind of shit.
Well,

2392
01:43:56,590 --> 01:43:58,370
you should always,
always be suspected.

2393
01:43:58,490 --> 01:44:00,500
The people running the show,
they're criminals through.

2394
01:44:00,501 --> 01:44:02,150
So you never,
you never go,

2395
01:44:02,270 --> 01:44:02,961
oh,
you know,

2396
01:44:02,961 --> 01:44:04,380
if someone tells you,
uh,

2397
01:44:04,520 --> 01:44:06,230
someone's obsessed with like,
let's say,

2398
01:44:06,770 --> 01:44:08,120
you know,
some famous killer,

2399
01:44:08,121 --> 01:44:08,954
I don't know,
uh,

2400
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:09,793
like John Gadi or whatever,
some criminal or whoever and he's 

2401
01:44:12,531 --> 01:44:15,050
obsessed with them and he knows a lot of
shit about this murder,

2402
01:44:15,051 --> 01:44:16,520
that murder,
this racket,

2403
01:44:16,521 --> 01:44:18,980
that racket.
This is this criminal activity.

2404
01:44:19,310 --> 01:44:20,270
Uh,
when,

2405
01:44:20,520 --> 01:44:22,310
if he told you,
yeah,

2406
01:44:22,340 --> 01:44:23,173
you,
you know what other murder he was 

2407
01:44:24,381 --> 01:44:27,020
involved in and you talk about it,
no dude's going to say,

2408
01:44:27,470 --> 01:44:29,810
uh,
now how do you know that's true?

2409
01:44:29,960 --> 01:44:30,793
How do you know that's true?
Where's the evidence that you probably 

2410
01:44:32,271 --> 01:44:34,130
going to go?
You take his word for it.

2411
01:44:34,130 --> 01:44:36,140
This guy's,
this guy's a criminal.

2412
01:44:36,440 --> 01:44:37,273
He's fucked up all this other shit.
And then he tells you about some new 

2413
01:44:39,921 --> 01:44:40,790
shit.
He fucked up.

2414
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,340
You're probably like a,
like a normal God go.

2415
01:44:43,341 --> 01:44:44,930
Yeah.
Even if he's wrong.

2416
01:44:44,931 --> 01:44:46,010
I mean,
he's still a criminal,

2417
01:44:46,011 --> 01:44:49,990
but probably I haven't looked into it,
but it's like that when,

2418
01:44:50,070 --> 01:44:50,903
when you,
when you could follow the money so 

2419
01:44:51,771 --> 01:44:53,930
easily and you just see the racket and 
you're just like,

2420
01:44:54,230 --> 01:44:57,770
oh man,
anytime cns is attacking fake news,

2421
01:44:57,920 --> 01:45:02,920
they're creating a fake news problem.
And I didn't follow what you were saying

2422
01:45:04,071 --> 01:45:06,230
there until you got to know what you're 
talking about.

2423
01:45:06,231 --> 01:45:07,500
You're talking about,
uh,

2424
01:45:07,510 --> 01:45:08,061
the,
uh,

2425
01:45:08,061 --> 01:45:08,894
the government's reason for,
for paying a UK publicity from $500 

2426
01:45:15,310 --> 01:45:17,690
million to make fake isis and al Qaeda 
videos.

2427
01:45:17,900 --> 01:45:19,280
To me,
$500,000

2428
01:45:19,281 --> 01:45:21,770
or 500 million,
those 450,

2429
01:45:21,830 --> 01:45:22,663
to me,
I don't want to be in the wrong about 

2430
01:45:24,051 --> 01:45:24,170
that.

2431
01:45:24,170 --> 01:45:26,720
You know,
we need wrong 500,000.

2432
01:45:26,721 --> 01:45:29,030
Let's say it's 500 million.
That's thought it was 450 million.

2433
01:45:29,120 --> 01:45:30,740
So when you see,
when you see that,

2434
01:45:30,741 --> 01:45:32,720
let's say you just saw that quote and 
you believed it.

2435
01:45:32,721 --> 01:45:34,010
Let's say she's right.
Okay.

2436
01:45:34,011 --> 01:45:35,580
Just pretend she's right.
Who,

2437
01:45:35,710 --> 01:45:36,390
whatever.
That,

2438
01:45:36,390 --> 01:45:38,800
that chick,
that Jill Jill Stein,

2439
01:45:39,350 --> 01:45:42,800
she's talking about,
andy is also funding the mujahideen,

2440
01:45:43,130 --> 01:45:45,150
which we were pretty open about when 
they were there willing.

2441
01:45:45,151 --> 01:45:48,770
That is,
that's what became the Islamic terrorist

2442
01:45:48,771 --> 01:45:49,870
of today.
But that's what we,

2443
01:45:50,050 --> 01:45:51,870
none of the funding tennis customer 
Russians,

2444
01:45:51,890 --> 01:45:52,723
let me finish real quick,
when you see a statement like that and 

2445
01:45:54,891 --> 01:45:57,260
there's many people saying that,
but there's a man,

2446
01:45:57,261 --> 01:45:57,951
there's one,
just,

2447
01:45:57,951 --> 01:45:58,784
just say that's true what she just said.
And then you find out that the 

2448
01:46:02,211 --> 01:46:05,390
government paid $500 million to make 
fake isis videos,

2449
01:46:05,720 --> 01:46:10,070
the funding numb and then they're making
fake isis videos.

2450
01:46:10,130 --> 01:46:12,170
Sounds like they want to blow that shit 
up.

2451
01:46:12,380 --> 01:46:14,510
You know?
So when you see the cover story,

2452
01:46:14,511 --> 01:46:17,030
when the government says the criminal 
says the criminal says,

2453
01:46:17,060 --> 01:46:20,000
ah,
what we were doing is we were making cds

2454
01:46:20,001 --> 01:46:20,834
and we were like dispersing them and 
then so that people would get them and 

2455
01:46:23,721 --> 01:46:24,860
then they would play them.
And you know,

2456
01:46:24,880 --> 01:46:25,600
you know,
we,

2457
01:46:25,600 --> 01:46:28,160
we did only a terrorist would play that 
cd,

2458
01:46:28,340 --> 01:46:29,173
so then we could track their ip address.
To me that's like some serious horse 

2459
01:46:33,381 --> 01:46:34,280
shit.
No,

2460
01:46:34,281 --> 01:46:36,830
but we do it the same with like in the 
drug industry.

2461
01:46:36,831 --> 01:46:37,664
If they catch a drug dealer they they 
flip him or use him for some to get to 

2462
01:46:40,911 --> 01:46:43,300
the bigger play there,
which is the drug kingpin.

2463
01:46:43,370 --> 01:46:44,900
Right,
so same thing with this.

2464
01:46:44,990 --> 01:46:47,780
They might,
they might fund those ridiculous videos.

2465
01:46:47,781 --> 01:46:50,790
You sounded like that the are criminal 
but no Eddie,

2466
01:46:50,791 --> 01:46:53,610
the problem is you think there's only 
one way to this.

2467
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:57,690
I think there's a like a,
a lack of nuance in the,

2468
01:46:57,691 --> 01:46:59,280
the,
the idea of this.

2469
01:46:59,460 --> 01:47:02,860
I think it's both.
I think for sure the government is going

2470
01:47:02,861 --> 01:47:03,694
to make some fake shit.
I mean they told us they were going to 

2471
01:47:05,101 --> 01:47:07,080
do it to fight the war on crime or in 
the fight.

2472
01:47:07,081 --> 01:47:09,060
The war on terror.
They told us they were going to do that.

2473
01:47:09,210 --> 01:47:11,280
They told us they were going to do it.
They do it in plain sight.

2474
01:47:11,281 --> 01:47:12,114
Then of course,
of course go along for sure 100% but 

2475
01:47:14,581 --> 01:47:15,414
also there's also people that are in 
charge of making sure it's not like 

2476
01:47:18,901 --> 01:47:19,734
everybody who is in the CIA or the FBI 
or any of these organizations is like a 

2477
01:47:23,881 --> 01:47:26,300
part of some gigantic said that,
when did I say that?

2478
01:47:26,850 --> 01:47:29,140
But never said okay.
Only but the people.

2479
01:47:29,310 --> 01:47:30,143
But the idea that the,
all the rest of them would know that 

2480
01:47:31,471 --> 01:47:33,300
it's bullshit and that would go along 
with it.

2481
01:47:33,480 --> 01:47:34,313
I don't think that's the case.
I think what they're trying to do is 

2482
01:47:35,970 --> 01:47:36,803
figure out ways where they could locate 
terrorists if they figured out a way 

2483
01:47:39,031 --> 01:47:39,864
they could located terrorist.
And it's through Ip checking of people 

2484
01:47:42,121 --> 01:47:43,890
who watched terrorist recruitment 
videos.

2485
01:47:44,220 --> 01:47:45,053
I don't think that's a bad idea.
It might not get everybody and it might 

2486
01:47:48,181 --> 01:47:50,460
not even work,
but it's not a bad idea.

2487
01:47:50,520 --> 01:47:53,160
They're doing a decent job.
Have you seen now just switch subjects a

2488
01:47:53,161 --> 01:47:54,480
little bit,
but how have you seen on a second?

2489
01:47:54,481 --> 01:47:56,410
Just don't,
don't you think that there's a w there,

2490
01:47:56,550 --> 01:47:57,383
there's gotta be some way.
If there are legitimate terrorists in 

2491
01:47:59,491 --> 01:48:00,570
the world and you're trying to find 
them,

2492
01:48:00,690 --> 01:48:02,880
he's gotta be some way to find them.
That's a good way to find them.

2493
01:48:03,340 --> 01:48:06,020
I Ip addresses,
if they're clicking on those videos,

2494
01:48:06,040 --> 01:48:06,873
funding them,
why would they try to find them really 

2495
01:48:08,710 --> 01:48:09,530
who's going yet?

2496
01:48:09,530 --> 01:48:11,220
He is at the same people.
That's my point.

2497
01:48:11,390 --> 01:48:13,370
Is it the same people that pitch,
but that does,

2498
01:48:13,380 --> 01:48:14,490
that's one person.
Eddie,

2499
01:48:14,700 --> 01:48:15,533
this is the same people that are in 
charge of making these videos to try to 

2500
01:48:20,041 --> 01:48:20,874
find these people.
Are they the same people that are also 

2501
01:48:23,010 --> 01:48:23,843
completely aware that they're funding 
them or is there a bunch of different 

2502
01:48:27,721 --> 01:48:31,770
factions all working together and each 
one of them doesn't completely be honest

2503
01:48:31,771 --> 01:48:33,030
with the other?
Yeah,

2504
01:48:33,031 --> 01:48:37,260
I could see that.
Definitely most of the CIA,

2505
01:48:37,440 --> 01:48:39,330
most of the FBI,
good,

2506
01:48:39,570 --> 01:48:41,070
honest,
hardworking people.

2507
01:48:41,071 --> 01:48:45,030
It's just people keep people in certain 
spots there.

2508
01:48:45,210 --> 01:48:46,740
I mean,
they're funding Isis.

2509
01:48:46,890 --> 01:48:48,570
That's just one quote.
There's many,

2510
01:48:48,571 --> 01:48:50,460
many quotes,
but let's just say that was true,

2511
01:48:50,461 --> 01:48:52,650
that quote that with that chick said,
that's true.

2512
01:48:52,770 --> 01:48:54,180
Okay.
We're funding CIC,

2513
01:48:54,480 --> 01:48:56,310
presidential candidate Jill Stein.

2514
01:48:58,500 --> 01:49:00,590
She's not the first one to say that,
but anyways,

2515
01:49:00,620 --> 01:49:02,240
right.
Let's just say what she,

2516
01:49:02,250 --> 01:49:06,190
that statement is true.
If it's true on Christmas,

2517
01:49:06,510 --> 01:49:09,390
if it's true,
if they're funding Isis,

2518
01:49:09,990 --> 01:49:10,823
yes.
There's probably a low level people 

2519
01:49:11,881 --> 01:49:12,241
saying,
hey,

2520
01:49:12,241 --> 01:49:13,074
how are we going to stop isis?
But the overall agenda is not to stop 

2521
01:49:17,281 --> 01:49:19,140
it.
The overall they're funding it.

2522
01:49:19,180 --> 01:49:21,170
Why they going to stop it?
They want to blow it up.

2523
01:49:21,171 --> 01:49:24,000
The funding it.
You'd put two and two together though.

2524
01:49:24,001 --> 01:49:24,661
Crip.
First of all,

2525
01:49:24,661 --> 01:49:26,310
the criminals at the top.
We know that.

2526
01:49:26,311 --> 01:49:28,560
Everybody knows.
Everybody know that,

2527
01:49:28,561 --> 01:49:29,394
so we we,
we got to treat them like a detective 

2528
01:49:32,101 --> 01:49:35,310
would like your average bullshit as 
detective would go this criminal,

2529
01:49:35,550 --> 01:49:38,790
the no one would ever know detective 
would ever look at a criminal.

2530
01:49:38,791 --> 01:49:41,130
God.
There's no way he would do that.

2531
01:49:41,730 --> 01:49:42,930
He doesn't have the time to do.

2532
01:49:42,930 --> 01:49:43,763
He does not that smart.
He doesn't have the smarts that he's so 

2533
01:49:45,781 --> 01:49:47,470
unorganized.
This guy would,

2534
01:49:47,500 --> 01:49:49,170
this guy,
he,

2535
01:49:49,290 --> 01:49:50,920
no detective would say that.
It'd be like,

2536
01:49:50,921 --> 01:49:52,570
you know what?
You're fucking criminal.

2537
01:49:52,571 --> 01:49:54,310
Let's look.
Maybe you are innocent.

2538
01:49:54,340 --> 01:49:56,440
Maybe you are,
but God damn,

2539
01:49:56,560 --> 01:49:57,393
look at the money trail,
look at all this circumstantial 

2540
01:49:59,651 --> 01:50:01,150
evidence.
It's just damn,

2541
01:50:01,810 --> 01:50:02,590
you know,
look at it.

2542
01:50:02,590 --> 01:50:04,530
And then the hardcore evidence documents
and Shit,

2543
01:50:04,531 --> 01:50:05,364
if you ask isis,
they're not going to tell you they're 

2544
01:50:06,191 --> 01:50:08,230
winning.
Like they're getting fucked up.

2545
01:50:08,260 --> 01:50:09,093
Who knows what they're saying?
They're funding them and they have 

2546
01:50:11,231 --> 01:50:15,010
control of the media.
Who fucking knows what the fuck is going

2547
01:50:15,011 --> 01:50:16,480
on?
Who really knows?

2548
01:50:16,600 --> 01:50:17,433
Nobody knows what the fuck's going to 
see how isis used to use twitter and 

2549
01:50:20,621 --> 01:50:22,050
certain things.
So as they would get,

2550
01:50:22,100 --> 01:50:22,933
you know,
followers to see stuff and organize 

2551
01:50:24,251 --> 01:50:25,900
plans.
Will twitter has a,

2552
01:50:25,930 --> 01:50:27,400
someone who's just 24,
seven,

2553
01:50:27,670 --> 01:50:30,100
Merck's those accounts where he can't 
have them anymore.

2554
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:31,233
Now that use telegraph,
you know what that is or they can send 

2555
01:50:33,611 --> 01:50:33,990
a,
uh,

2556
01:50:33,990 --> 01:50:34,823
it's a,
you can organize a private chat room so 

2557
01:50:36,761 --> 01:50:38,350
he can whatever,
they have us code words.

2558
01:50:38,351 --> 01:50:39,184
All those isis followers go there and 
then they ha they logged in and they 

2559
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:43,833
somehow some guy got into it cause you 
have to prove everyone in the secret 

2560
01:50:45,881 --> 01:50:48,640
chat rooms and it says what they want to
do.

2561
01:50:48,760 --> 01:50:49,800
And they'll say,
uh,

2562
01:50:50,070 --> 01:50:53,080
just crazy example in milwaukee.
How many guys do,

2563
01:50:53,140 --> 01:50:54,490
they'll say,
how many guys do we have?

2564
01:50:54,491 --> 01:50:56,410
And there's seven,
but we have these guns.

2565
01:50:56,411 --> 01:50:58,710
These guns were going to hit up this,
oh I scouted,

2566
01:50:58,750 --> 01:51:00,400
I did this.
So they're going to,

2567
01:51:00,401 --> 01:51:02,830
the guy owns telegraph going,
what the fuck man,

2568
01:51:02,860 --> 01:51:04,360
stop these accounts.
And he's like,

2569
01:51:04,730 --> 01:51:05,310
ah,
you know,

2570
01:51:05,310 --> 01:51:08,080
I created so everyone can use it,
man.

2571
01:51:08,140 --> 01:51:08,973
These high level security I create for 
that and this dude just get in fucking 

2572
01:51:12,131 --> 01:51:12,964
reamed for it.
Does he not have the abilities and 

2573
01:51:14,561 --> 01:51:16,460
Russian?
He does have the Barista.

2574
01:51:16,510 --> 01:51:19,360
He's in Russia.
But what happens is these accounts go up

2575
01:51:19,630 --> 01:51:22,570
and then after you're done there they 
their race forever.

2576
01:51:22,900 --> 01:51:24,940
That's why people use them.
Wow.

2577
01:51:25,510 --> 01:51:27,580
Interesting.
Israeli hackers have said this.

2578
01:51:27,940 --> 01:51:29,140
It's crazy time,
dude.

2579
01:51:29,350 --> 01:51:30,700
It's a crazy time.
Cause you,

2580
01:51:30,701 --> 01:51:31,220
yeah.
And then he,

2581
01:51:31,220 --> 01:51:31,961
his point,
he goes,

2582
01:51:31,961 --> 01:51:34,510
I didn't create a fucking telegram for 
Isis,

2583
01:51:34,511 --> 01:51:36,860
but just like anything,
we create some good,

2584
01:51:36,940 --> 01:51:38,230
it's bad.
People follow.

2585
01:51:38,231 --> 01:51:39,064
I can't control any,
what was that guy that he kept telling 

2586
01:51:40,481 --> 01:51:42,060
me about?
Was it Gary Vanerchuck?

2587
01:51:42,061 --> 01:51:42,894
Is that the guy?
Yeah,

2588
01:51:42,940 --> 01:51:46,860
I saw an interview with him,
man in that he was talking about people,

2589
01:51:46,861 --> 01:51:47,694
I'm using phones and this lady goes,
isn't it terrible what we're doing to 

2590
01:51:51,191 --> 01:51:53,140
these young people using phones?
And he was like,

2591
01:51:53,141 --> 01:51:53,961
look,
this is you.

2592
01:51:53,961 --> 01:51:56,320
You're looking at human evolution.
We're not doing anything.

2593
01:51:56,321 --> 01:51:57,280
These people,
this is like,

2594
01:51:57,430 --> 01:51:59,410
this is what people are doing and you 
know,

2595
01:51:59,411 --> 01:52:01,720
just step back and look at what's 
happening.

2596
01:52:01,721 --> 01:52:02,554
And he was saying that because we're 
just going to be looking in the future 

2597
01:52:04,871 --> 01:52:05,704
back at this time,
like this is the good old days before 

2598
01:52:07,361 --> 01:52:11,560
virtual reality for sure.
It seems to me that all these things are

2599
01:52:11,561 --> 01:52:13,630
competing together,
that taking over,

2600
01:52:13,750 --> 01:52:15,550
taking over various aspects of the 
world,

2601
01:52:15,551 --> 01:52:18,880
controlling global resources like oil 
and things along those lines.

2602
01:52:18,881 --> 01:52:22,360
And they are windmills now that assigns 
a fucking seven 47.

2603
01:52:22,380 --> 01:52:23,213
Have you seen these gigantic windmills 
that they're putting together trying to 

2604
01:52:25,121 --> 01:52:25,954
figure out how to dominate the 
production of electricity and oil and 

2605
01:52:28,781 --> 01:52:29,614
gas and keep money flowing and all the 
while we're getting drawn deeper and 

2606
01:52:33,341 --> 01:52:34,174
deeper into this electronic world.
Like we've got some weird shit going on 

2607
01:52:37,061 --> 01:52:40,080
in our future folks.
Weird Matrix style shit.

2608
01:52:40,170 --> 01:52:41,580
Did you see in Dubai?
They're already,

2609
01:52:41,640 --> 01:52:42,473
they're building it now that we're those
tubes so you can get from Dubai to 

2610
01:52:45,351 --> 01:52:48,560
wherever in like 30 minutes.
Hyperloops uh,

2611
01:52:48,680 --> 01:52:50,360
Elon Musk is the one that came up with 
it,

2612
01:52:50,361 --> 01:52:51,470
but uh,
in Dubai,

2613
01:52:51,471 --> 01:52:54,140
the the first ones to actually fund it 
and raise the money and they're building

2614
01:52:54,141 --> 01:52:55,520
it now.
That's scary.

2615
01:52:55,521 --> 01:52:56,354
That's a plane on the ground on now,
son jumping a tube and just imagine the 

2616
01:53:02,301 --> 01:53:07,170
feeling of going 500 miles an hour,
500 mile an hour,

2617
01:53:07,171 --> 01:53:09,590
a hyperloop train.
That's not that fast.

2618
01:53:10,460 --> 01:53:14,240
It takes you from Abu Dhabi to Dubai in 
12 minutes with Smith's son.

2619
01:53:14,510 --> 01:53:15,343
That's amazing.
They're saying if they do it right in 

2620
01:53:17,481 --> 01:53:19,220
America,
you can be able to live in la,

2621
01:53:19,250 --> 01:53:21,590
work in New York every day.
Oh my God.

2622
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:25,500
Fuck all that.
Jumping in that first.

2623
01:53:25,530 --> 01:53:26,870
You're going to be in that too.
For what?

2624
01:53:26,871 --> 01:53:28,760
At least 500 miles an hour.

2625
01:53:28,760 --> 01:53:29,970
It's going to five hours.
No,

2626
01:53:29,971 --> 01:53:30,804
no.
That star that's just started to fuck 

2627
01:53:32,960 --> 01:53:36,370
you on must saying like 1200 miles an 
hour is what there is.

2628
01:53:36,380 --> 01:53:40,250
What they're planning 500 miles an hour 
aside to think what like a plane flies.

2629
01:53:40,251 --> 01:53:41,660
I don't think it's any faster than a 
plane.

2630
01:53:41,930 --> 01:53:44,510
I can go underground.
That's true.

2631
01:53:44,600 --> 01:53:49,250
Yeah,
so 500 miles an hour in a plane,

2632
01:53:50,480 --> 01:53:51,313
but it takes you five hours.
This is across the country for five 

2633
01:53:56,361 --> 01:53:57,520
hours.
It's,

2634
01:53:57,550 --> 01:53:59,120
it's inevitable.
They're going to do it.

2635
01:54:00,740 --> 01:54:03,620
It's going to be five hours now it's 12 
miles,

2636
01:54:03,650 --> 01:54:06,050
1200 miles an hour.
That's probably two and a half,

2637
01:54:06,051 --> 01:54:09,220
two and a half hours to get tenured.
A long time to do a long time.

2638
01:54:09,580 --> 01:54:10,660
Go.
Going to fast.

2639
01:54:10,700 --> 01:54:12,860
Comfortable too.
When you can walk around this tube,

2640
01:54:13,130 --> 01:54:14,900
maybe it's uh,
how big is this tube?

2641
01:54:15,550 --> 01:54:17,630
Is it worse?
Is it worse?

2642
01:54:17,630 --> 01:54:20,300
This smell,
people's farts in a tube going 500 miles

2643
01:54:20,301 --> 01:54:24,080
now on the ground or in a tube going 500
miles an hour in the sky.

2644
01:54:24,140 --> 01:54:25,340
The Sky,
the plan.

2645
01:54:25,970 --> 01:54:29,620
How often do you just say fuck it,
I cannot hold these motherfuckers.

2646
01:54:30,030 --> 01:54:33,470
You let him so fucking,
that shit is so rude.

2647
01:54:33,471 --> 01:54:34,304
Cause most of the time you hold it in 
right most of the time and try to time 

2648
01:54:36,581 --> 01:54:37,414
it.
You got a bathroom,

2649
01:54:37,730 --> 01:54:39,260
you gotta do right?
He's got damn good.

2650
01:54:39,920 --> 01:54:41,270
Nailed it man.
You ever just said,

2651
01:54:41,271 --> 01:54:42,104
fuck it,
I'm just going to go for it and 

2652
01:54:42,831 --> 01:54:44,360
whatever.
I'm just gonna keep my eyes closed.

2653
01:54:44,480 --> 01:54:47,160
Put your eye shades on the tender 
asleep.

2654
01:54:47,780 --> 01:54:50,210
They just let them go.
Dudes do that to me all the time.

2655
01:54:51,970 --> 01:54:54,230
This guy decided to just go for it.
I'm like,

2656
01:54:54,231 --> 01:54:55,064
I don't know.
It could either be this guy or that guy 

2657
01:54:56,571 --> 01:54:58,980
that recycled air,
just fucking your world up.

2658
01:54:59,020 --> 01:55:02,180
It's gotta be like a suction thing in 
your and the seat.

2659
01:55:02,450 --> 01:55:04,560
So like a little button you press and it
soaks.

2660
01:55:05,850 --> 01:55:10,850
It does help.
That shit does help a lot.

2661
01:55:11,270 --> 01:55:13,880
They say,
oh it's pretty good.

2662
01:55:14,520 --> 01:55:18,140
It was probably for the farts.
For the fights.

2663
01:55:18,260 --> 01:55:19,093
Probably broad.
You have a fucking fat wherever in a 

2664
01:55:21,531 --> 01:55:23,150
restaurant.
Do you have a fan blowing on you?

2665
01:55:23,151 --> 01:55:24,710
It blows.
That's hard.

2666
01:55:24,780 --> 01:55:25,613
Yeah.
They need to fix that problem and claim 

2667
01:55:30,930 --> 01:55:32,680
for the farts and they never talked 
about it.

2668
01:55:33,320 --> 01:55:34,153
Mark fans for 500% or you know what?
Back when people used to smoke on 

2669
01:55:40,701 --> 01:55:41,534
planes,
that's when they had them remember that 

2670
01:55:43,500 --> 01:55:44,220
these to smoke

2671
01:55:44,220 --> 01:55:47,100
on planes and then it got to the point 
where you could only smoke in the back.

2672
01:55:47,280 --> 01:55:49,140
So they had a smoking section.
Yeah,

2673
01:55:49,141 --> 01:55:51,750
I used to fly back then.
He was crazy.

2674
01:55:51,950 --> 01:55:54,810
You would?
I would be in those sections man.

2675
01:55:55,020 --> 01:55:56,420
Cause I was,
I would be,

2676
01:55:56,460 --> 01:55:58,110
that's where he could buy tickets.
People just like,

2677
01:55:58,111 --> 01:55:59,760
they would say the only tickets that are
available,

2678
01:55:59,761 --> 01:56:01,530
the smoking section and it would cost 
less.

2679
01:56:01,930 --> 01:56:03,480
You go into that fucking smoking 
section,

2680
01:56:03,481 --> 01:56:07,960
just sit down people around your light 
and home in a two.

2681
01:56:08,780 --> 01:56:13,370
Meanwhile you come on the whole craze 
smoking cessation point though.

2682
01:56:13,380 --> 01:56:14,213
Yeah.
Dice clay used to have a little bit 

2683
01:56:14,611 --> 01:56:16,330
about it.
We're in a fucking toe.

2684
01:56:18,320 --> 01:56:19,153
Don't have to go back to everybody's 
breathing the same fucking hell bit 

2685
01:56:25,311 --> 01:56:27,000
about a man.
It was fucking hilarious.

2686
01:56:27,360 --> 01:56:28,193
Yeah,
it has a weird time when people used to 

2687
01:56:29,071 --> 01:56:31,920
go to smoke everywhere in restaurants,
in Bar,

2688
01:56:31,930 --> 01:56:32,763
everywhere you went,
you would see people smoking movie 

2689
01:56:34,420 --> 01:56:35,253
theaters.

2690
01:56:35,670 --> 01:56:36,503
Now I love that.
We tell you not to smoke in movie 

2691
01:56:38,311 --> 01:56:39,750
theaters where people would do it all 
the time.

2692
01:56:39,751 --> 01:56:41,100
People get mad at him.
Hey man,

2693
01:56:41,370 --> 01:56:44,860
put it out.
That was one of those laws that was at,

2694
01:56:44,970 --> 01:56:47,060
that's what I mean.
The government work.

2695
01:56:47,070 --> 01:56:49,510
Totally Shit.
Well,

2696
01:56:49,511 --> 01:56:51,600
you know what was a good law?
You know why?

2697
01:56:51,601 --> 01:56:52,434
Because people were filing lawsuits.
A lot of people that worked inside 

2698
01:56:55,411 --> 01:56:57,390
restaurants and bars,
they were getting cancer,

2699
01:56:57,780 --> 01:57:01,290
lung cancer from secondhand smoke.
Imagine if your job was to be a waitress

2700
01:57:01,470 --> 01:57:03,700
and you got to go to this fucking bar 
everyday people go,

2701
01:57:03,701 --> 01:57:05,010
oh,
gives you shoot booger.

2702
01:57:05,150 --> 01:57:06,330
Well,
it's a good job.

2703
01:57:06,420 --> 01:57:09,360
Why should you be subject to being 
poisoned at a good job?

2704
01:57:09,480 --> 01:57:11,310
Like you have to like,
it's a crazy,

2705
01:57:11,311 --> 01:57:13,860
it's not like drinking.
If you're drinking and I'm not drinking,

2706
01:57:13,861 --> 01:57:14,550
I'm right next to you.

2707
01:57:14,550 --> 01:57:15,860
I don't suffer anything.
Yeah.

2708
01:57:15,960 --> 01:57:16,793
But if you're smoking right next to me,
and especially if you work in a place 

2709
01:57:18,691 --> 01:57:20,490
where everybody's smoking,
man,

2710
01:57:20,520 --> 01:57:22,350
you're going to die.
Strip club baby.

2711
01:57:22,470 --> 01:57:24,900
I never got him to cigarettes.
You guys are flipped with cigarettes.

2712
01:57:25,080 --> 01:57:26,650
No,
but I've had them before.

2713
01:57:26,680 --> 01:57:28,310
Go on stage before with Tony 
Hinchcliffe.

2714
01:57:28,500 --> 01:57:30,720
I've taken a smacks snacks.
He does.

2715
01:57:31,260 --> 01:57:32,470
Yeah.
They fire you up dude.

2716
01:57:32,510 --> 01:57:33,510
It's like a,
it gives you,

2717
01:57:33,511 --> 01:57:34,440
it's a stimulant.
It's,

2718
01:57:34,441 --> 01:57:35,274
it's a,
it's very much like a nootropic really 

2719
01:57:36,901 --> 01:57:39,210
very,
very bad for your body for sure.

2720
01:57:39,420 --> 01:57:44,370
But stimulant in itself,
like tobacco is a stimulant for sure.

2721
01:57:44,580 --> 01:57:46,320
100%.
I'll give you,

2722
01:57:46,321 --> 01:57:47,610
um,
if you could chew,

2723
01:57:47,611 --> 01:57:49,170
I think it would probably be the better 
move.

2724
01:57:49,320 --> 01:57:52,320
Like Donald gave me some of those chew 
when I was here and I was like,

2725
01:57:52,321 --> 01:57:54,390
whoa.
Like this stuff fires you up,

2726
01:57:54,910 --> 01:57:56,220
gets you kind of like buzz.

2727
01:57:56,250 --> 01:57:56,581
Yeah,
yeah,

2728
01:57:56,581 --> 01:57:57,181
yeah,
for sure.

2729
01:57:57,181 --> 01:57:58,380
That's what that was.
Smoked cigars,

2730
01:57:58,381 --> 01:57:59,880
Bro.
Bro.

2731
01:58:00,210 --> 01:58:01,020
Bro.
Bro.

2732
01:58:01,020 --> 01:58:01,853
I don't know me from trying to load so 
that down and trying to cut way back on 

2733
01:58:04,741 --> 01:58:05,574
the Bros.
But occasionally they sneak through the 

2734
01:58:07,821 --> 01:58:12,750
broan is if they ruined bro by con con.
Anybody who's an asshole,

2735
01:58:12,751 --> 01:58:14,280
bro.
Come on Bro.

2736
01:58:14,370 --> 01:58:15,810
He's a bro,
you know.

2737
01:58:15,960 --> 01:58:17,280
But um,
yeah man,

2738
01:58:17,281 --> 01:58:18,830
for sure.
Like there's a,

2739
01:58:19,600 --> 01:58:21,430
there's no doubt about it.
It's,

2740
01:58:21,440 --> 01:58:23,640
it's a definite stimulant.
Like if you smoke a cigar,

2741
01:58:23,641 --> 01:58:24,474
you get a buzz.
You don't see a lot of smokers these 

2742
01:58:26,730 --> 01:58:27,690
days though.
They're smart.

2743
01:58:27,691 --> 01:58:29,100
People are smartening up.
Well,

2744
01:58:29,101 --> 01:58:32,310
you hang out with athletes.
I hang out with zero athletes.

2745
01:58:32,320 --> 01:58:34,290
There you hang out with comedians that 
don't smoke.

2746
01:58:34,350 --> 01:58:35,183
Yeah.
Comedians don't smoke these days way 

2747
01:58:36,421 --> 01:58:37,950
less.
Way less.

2748
01:58:37,980 --> 01:58:40,560
It used to be almost everybody.
Swiss deleah doesn't even drink.

2749
01:58:41,080 --> 01:58:42,190
Yeah.
Well he never

2750
01:58:42,200 --> 01:58:43,330
drank,
drank or smoked.

2751
01:58:43,570 --> 01:58:45,260
There's a lot of guys who don't drink.
Um,

2752
01:58:45,430 --> 01:58:46,810
but back in the day,
man,

2753
01:58:46,811 --> 01:58:49,960
most guys smoked like are used to smoke 
dunkin used to smog.

2754
01:58:49,961 --> 01:58:52,300
Joe Use a small red bands still smokes 
now.

2755
01:58:52,301 --> 01:58:53,200
No,
I never smoked.

2756
01:58:53,370 --> 01:58:54,700
No,
no athlete.

2757
01:58:54,910 --> 01:58:55,391
Yeah,
I was,

2758
01:58:55,391 --> 01:58:55,961
well,
I was healthy.

2759
01:58:55,961 --> 01:58:57,080
I was still working out.
Yeah.

2760
01:58:57,310 --> 01:58:59,230
Like all the time I was doing standup in
the beginning,

2761
01:58:59,231 --> 01:59:01,030
I was kickboxing then like got to 
Jujitsu.

2762
01:59:01,031 --> 01:59:02,710
I did Jujitsu straight through.
Like I never,

2763
01:59:02,711 --> 01:59:06,040
I never didn't actually say you can't 
smoke cigarettes and do Jujitsu,

2764
01:59:07,990 --> 01:59:10,090
but you're going to get taught,
you're going to miss a lot.

2765
01:59:10,180 --> 01:59:11,500
And it's tough.
I mean,

2766
01:59:11,501 --> 01:59:13,210
you're,
you're not just working out,

2767
01:59:13,211 --> 01:59:14,044
you're playing a game of death and if 
you tap out because you fucking gas out 

2768
01:59:16,870 --> 01:59:19,150
that you got tapped out and then never 
feels that good.

2769
01:59:19,151 --> 01:59:20,200
That's what Jujitsu is.

2770
01:59:20,200 --> 01:59:21,130
So,
uh,

2771
01:59:21,220 --> 01:59:22,450
people get obsessed with it.
So,

2772
01:59:22,510 --> 01:59:23,500
so much.
You guys,

2773
01:59:23,501 --> 01:59:26,350
why Joe Schilling is a crazy example.
He's crazy.

2774
01:59:26,410 --> 01:59:27,243
He smokes.
Joe Schilling is a worldclass kickboxer 

2775
01:59:29,800 --> 01:59:32,950
and he smoked smoking all the time.
Hello?

2776
01:59:32,980 --> 01:59:34,270
Pack a day.
Wow.

2777
01:59:34,870 --> 01:59:36,370
That's amazing.
They say smokes a pack a day.

2778
01:59:37,720 --> 01:59:40,090
Not In Kansas coming back,
but I think he was up to that.

2779
01:59:40,091 --> 01:59:40,511
Yeah.
Yeah.

2780
01:59:40,511 --> 01:59:42,370
Not In quippy.
Little while did it again.

2781
01:59:42,400 --> 01:59:45,670
It needs to get on them.
Robot dicks suck on one of them.

2782
01:59:45,671 --> 01:59:46,600
Robot decks,
those,

2783
01:59:46,601 --> 01:59:47,890
uh,
those vaporizers.

2784
01:59:49,810 --> 01:59:52,990
Bill strawberry clouds.
They do smell nice too.

2785
01:59:53,470 --> 01:59:55,990
I don't mind if people do that.
I don't think it gives you the buzz that

2786
01:59:55,991 --> 01:59:56,824
a cigarette though though.
I think cigarette gives you a very 

2787
01:59:58,031 --> 02:00:00,340
specific buzz.
I think it was just chemicals,

2788
02:00:00,341 --> 02:00:02,920
all that thick smoke.
There's a fucking,

2789
02:00:03,330 --> 02:00:06,220
if Eddie wants to come back and talk 
more theories on conspiracies,

2790
02:00:06,221 --> 02:00:07,240
which is always wonderful.

2791
02:00:07,560 --> 02:00:09,430
Those fantastic.
He's so mad.

2792
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:13,240
We barely talked about the UFC.
Everybody's so mad right now.

2793
02:00:13,300 --> 02:00:14,133
Zero option.
They're a shit what we do and it's what 

2794
02:00:17,831 --> 02:00:19,870
we do.
We're all like,

2795
02:00:19,871 --> 02:00:21,270
yeah,
UFC capacity.

2796
02:00:21,290 --> 02:00:22,780
So much fun.
So much fun.

2797
02:00:22,781 --> 02:00:23,614
We saw the time but um,
they did the FDA approved like 500 plus 

2798
02:00:28,391 --> 02:00:30,520
chemicals and to put them in a 
cigarette.

2799
02:00:30,521 --> 02:00:33,610
So all designed to make you more and 
more addicted to.

2800
02:00:33,611 --> 02:00:36,540
But did you know,
cigarettes a never been less popular and

2801
02:00:36,590 --> 02:00:37,423
uh,
my generation they think is going to be 

2802
02:00:38,591 --> 02:00:41,470
the final kind of strongly get rid of 
smoking.

2803
02:00:41,500 --> 02:00:42,333
Cause now it's just,
it's more of a healthier kind of vibe 

2804
02:00:45,011 --> 02:00:46,870
now with millennials and stuff like 
that.

2805
02:00:46,871 --> 02:00:48,370
So smoking is,
you're fucked.

2806
02:00:48,580 --> 02:00:49,720
Like really?
No one's doing it.

2807
02:00:49,721 --> 02:00:51,460
I wonder if too,
we'll carry on.

2808
02:00:51,580 --> 02:00:54,120
They need more of those dudes that get 
their jar removed.

2809
02:00:54,250 --> 02:00:57,760
See Lung cancer,
because we're up here,

2810
02:00:58,390 --> 02:00:59,223
we're in California.
If we're down south in Georgia or some 

2811
02:01:01,790 --> 02:01:02,623
shit like that it,
but that she went left and right to the 

2812
02:01:03,530 --> 02:01:04,363
point he had like a hidden camera and 
you put it on the chew section of a 

2813
02:01:08,081 --> 02:01:12,480
store on a fucking choose locked Pelican
calm.

2814
02:01:12,490 --> 02:01:15,400
Chewies shoot.
People who Chew Chewies I dunno.

2815
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:16,353
You could,
you could do,

2816
02:01:16,400 --> 02:01:19,150
do what?
Do Your chewy like have a club.

2817
02:01:19,760 --> 02:01:21,680
Yeah.
Yeah.

2818
02:01:22,070 --> 02:01:23,710
You don't think they called tooheys?
That's going to work?

2819
02:01:24,520 --> 02:01:26,250
No.
Oh well,

2820
02:01:26,310 --> 02:01:27,580
um,
we were talking about the smoke.

2821
02:01:27,710 --> 02:01:32,230
You can chew and like Donald has 
fantastic cardio and he chews or dips.

2822
02:01:32,290 --> 02:01:33,550
Was it a different,
she'll dip,

2823
02:01:33,580 --> 02:01:36,100
dip,
dip paired the same thing.

2824
02:01:36,101 --> 02:01:36,934
But the shoe was like,
remember those old school baseball 

2825
02:01:38,231 --> 02:01:39,830
players look like?
Yeah,

2826
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:40,120
they have

2827
02:01:40,120 --> 02:01:43,730
that shit like Lenny Dykstra.
Yeah.

2828
02:01:43,820 --> 02:01:44,631
You know,
it's really crazy,

2829
02:01:44,631 --> 02:01:47,870
man.
That is probably very similar to what it

2830
02:01:47,871 --> 02:01:50,240
feels like when you're chewing cocoa 
leaves.

2831
02:01:50,690 --> 02:01:53,960
But the coca leaves are illegal.
Like when those guys in Peru,

2832
02:01:53,961 --> 02:01:57,350
they take those coca leaves and they put
them in the side of their mouth and they

2833
02:01:57,351 --> 02:01:58,910
chew on them and they showed them all 
the time.

2834
02:01:58,980 --> 02:01:59,813
And you get,
you also get actual vitamins from the 

2835
02:02:04,040 --> 02:02:05,060
flavonoids,
I guess.

2836
02:02:05,090 --> 02:02:06,440
God Damn Cell.
Look at that guy.

2837
02:02:06,620 --> 02:02:08,120
That many.
Yeah,

2838
02:02:08,540 --> 02:02:10,550
that's cat Jamie.
That's the wrong stuff.

2839
02:02:11,290 --> 02:02:14,060
You want to coca leaves that,
that's God.

2840
02:02:14,061 --> 02:02:16,850
That's a stimulant or a,
a narcotic rather.

2841
02:02:17,060 --> 02:02:19,610
That cat stuff is very much like a,
not a narcotic.

2842
02:02:19,611 --> 02:02:21,430
It's like meth.
Dan's us.

2843
02:02:22,360 --> 02:02:23,630
Yeah.
It makes it crazy.

2844
02:02:23,631 --> 02:02:26,900
They do a lot of crazy shit on it,
but this stuff is a coca leaves.

2845
02:02:27,080 --> 02:02:27,913
They take it and they pack their mouth 
with it and they chew on it and it has 

2846
02:02:31,101 --> 02:02:32,930
an effect,
a stimulant effect.

2847
02:02:32,930 --> 02:02:36,170
It's similar to a cup of coffee.
I've never done it,

2848
02:02:36,200 --> 02:02:37,670
but I have had,
um,

2849
02:02:37,760 --> 02:02:40,750
a tea that was made out of it as a 
Matteto [inaudible] tea.

2850
02:02:40,760 --> 02:02:43,220
Crunk no,
but I couldn't shut the fuck up,

2851
02:02:43,221 --> 02:02:44,880
which is always a problem already.
It was like,

2852
02:02:44,940 --> 02:02:47,660
are awesome depending on what your job 
is.

2853
02:02:47,950 --> 02:02:48,441
No,
it wasn't.

2854
02:02:48,441 --> 02:02:49,970
Coke was,
I wasn't jacked.

2855
02:02:50,030 --> 02:02:51,530
I don't know.
I've never done cuts.

2856
02:02:51,531 --> 02:02:52,760
Work coat comes from,
right?

2857
02:02:52,761 --> 02:02:53,810
Yes,
exactly.

2858
02:02:53,960 --> 02:02:57,440
But it's chewing the leaves versus the 
processed soup.

2859
02:02:57,470 --> 02:02:58,303
It's like the difference between getting
your sugar from eating an orange versus 

2860
02:03:01,790 --> 02:03:05,840
eating like a couple of tablespoons of 
like real processed sugar.

2861
02:03:05,841 --> 02:03:07,100
What?
Like your body's like,

2862
02:03:07,101 --> 02:03:07,934
what the fuck is this?
Like where the hell is this shit coming 

2863
02:03:09,531 --> 02:03:12,440
from body doesn't know what the fuck you
do with like a spoon of sugar.

2864
02:03:12,441 --> 02:03:15,680
It's like Whoa,
why is this alone?

2865
02:03:16,950 --> 02:03:18,830
Where's,
where's all the fiber?

2866
02:03:18,830 --> 02:03:21,190
Where's the fucking vitamins?
This is just shit.

2867
02:03:21,191 --> 02:03:22,810
What did you do?
You crazy assholes.

2868
02:03:22,811 --> 02:03:25,100
That's what cocaine is and that's why I 
can fuck with fruit.

2869
02:03:25,101 --> 02:03:26,060
Cause the fiber,
right?

2870
02:03:26,061 --> 02:03:26,894
Cause they breaks down different and 
that's why I think these people that 

2871
02:03:29,510 --> 02:03:30,343
chew these cocoa leaves,
they get a totally different experience 

2872
02:03:31,971 --> 02:03:34,340
than someone who does coke.
I need to try it though.

2873
02:03:34,430 --> 02:03:35,263
I never chewed the leaves.
You'd be done with two popular to those 

2874
02:03:37,590 --> 02:03:40,130
should be legal bro.
It should be 100% legal.

2875
02:03:41,100 --> 02:03:42,120
It's illegal.
The pride.

2876
02:03:42,121 --> 02:03:42,954
You can't even have those leaves.
The problem is you could take those 

2877
02:03:44,271 --> 02:03:45,800
leaves,
you can process it into cocaine,

2878
02:03:46,040 --> 02:03:51,040
which by the way is an actual ingredient
and cocacola still cocaine is still,

2879
02:03:51,621 --> 02:03:53,540
yes.
Yes it is.

2880
02:03:53,930 --> 02:03:54,763
They take coca leaves,
they processed the coca leaves and they 

2881
02:03:57,741 --> 02:04:01,400
make medical cocaine with it.
And the same plant that does this,

2882
02:04:01,401 --> 02:04:06,020
the same processing place it does this 
ships the flavors of it to Coca Cola.

2883
02:04:06,470 --> 02:04:08,540
So it's one of the main flavors they 
use.

2884
02:04:08,550 --> 02:04:09,383
Got Coca Cola and Pepsi Cola are two 
totally different tasting things I've 

2885
02:04:11,741 --> 02:04:12,574
enclosed.
And one of the reasons why they taste 

2886
02:04:13,521 --> 02:04:14,354
different is coca cola used to have 
cocaine in it and now it's flavored by 

2887
02:04:17,421 --> 02:04:18,254
coca leaves.
Google that coke is so much better than 

2888
02:04:20,571 --> 02:04:22,850
Pepsi Cooler that they still look at 
this,

2889
02:04:22,970 --> 02:04:24,680
look at this.
To this day dude,

2890
02:04:24,890 --> 02:04:28,130
coca extractions is,
it's got cocaine free leaves are sold to

2891
02:04:28,131 --> 02:04:29,780
Coca Cola.
Exactly.

2892
02:04:30,020 --> 02:04:34,150
So they take these cocoa leaves,
the factory processes them,

2893
02:04:34,220 --> 02:04:38,040
turns him into medical cocaine and the 
rest of the shit that's processed

2894
02:04:38,040 --> 02:04:43,040
without cocaine in it is shipped to Coca
Cola flavor knowledge.

2895
02:04:43,170 --> 02:04:44,003
Hey,
the medical cocaine when it's medical 

2896
02:04:47,350 --> 02:04:49,230
lidacain um,
which is uh,

2897
02:04:49,231 --> 02:04:52,050
one of the things that they use.
It's like the gay cousin of cocaine they

2898
02:04:52,051 --> 02:04:52,884
use it for,
doesn't get you high but it numbs you 

2899
02:04:54,391 --> 02:04:55,950
up.
Damn.

2900
02:04:56,010 --> 02:04:57,120
Um,
yeah.

2901
02:04:57,121 --> 02:05:01,800
It's um,
we took a lot of Coca Cola.

2902
02:05:01,801 --> 02:05:04,560
They must be making a lot of medical 
cocaine man.

2903
02:05:04,620 --> 02:05:05,453
Oh yeah.
They must be making ridiculous amounts 

2904
02:05:06,331 --> 02:05:09,270
of it.
I wonder how much the actual flavor they

2905
02:05:09,271 --> 02:05:12,660
get out of the leaves versus actual 
cocaine.

2906
02:05:12,880 --> 02:05:13,713
It's probably taken a lot of leaves to 
get cocaine's last time you had like a 

2907
02:05:15,660 --> 02:05:17,880
nice ice cold Coke Cola.
I don't drink.

2908
02:05:17,881 --> 02:05:19,390
It's terrible.
It's terrible.

2909
02:05:19,391 --> 02:05:21,930
I had a diet coke last night though.
Well that's even worse.

2910
02:05:22,080 --> 02:05:24,660
That's even worse.
That shit is rarely do.

2911
02:05:24,720 --> 02:05:26,120
But it said fuck it.
It's Christmas dude.

2912
02:05:26,130 --> 02:05:26,580
I did too.

2913
02:05:26,580 --> 02:05:31,580
And I had a regular coke,
regular coke.

2914
02:05:31,801 --> 02:05:35,610
That shit is delicious.
So good barbecue.

2915
02:05:35,700 --> 02:05:36,533
Come on.
I'd wake up in the middle of the night 

2916
02:05:39,751 --> 02:05:40,584
and run down to the 24 hour liquor store
and get a couple cans of coke and just 

2917
02:05:43,111 --> 02:05:45,930
like down in one drink.
I had a drink hold cans in one drink.

2918
02:05:46,270 --> 02:05:48,210
How was obsessed with sodas?
Man,

2919
02:05:48,240 --> 02:05:53,150
think about how much sugar,
how much sugar in my throat.

2920
02:05:53,280 --> 02:05:54,113
I'm addicted to that one.
I just want the constant burn when it's 

2921
02:05:56,311 --> 02:05:57,720
cold too.
Ooh,

2922
02:05:57,721 --> 02:05:59,370
that's nice.
That's nice.

2923
02:06:00,140 --> 02:06:00,973
Pace the same.
It does not taste the same out of those 

2924
02:06:02,461 --> 02:06:05,180
fucking fountains.
You better stop calling that call.

2925
02:06:05,220 --> 02:06:08,430
Look at that show your Goddamn Liar.
That is not the same formula.

2926
02:06:08,640 --> 02:06:09,473
You get to be out of Pfoa at 100% gotta 
be out of a can or a bottle or a bottle 

2927
02:06:13,201 --> 02:06:15,150
or that Mexican bottle with that cane 
sugar.

2928
02:06:15,270 --> 02:06:16,730
But that green bottle,
no,

2929
02:06:16,731 --> 02:06:17,564
the ones that you get at certain stores,
Coca Cola Green cause that's how you 

2930
02:06:21,211 --> 02:06:23,000
know having a pure cane sugar.
Oh,

2931
02:06:23,390 --> 02:06:24,223
green green's a different kind of is.
They don't know what the fuck you're 

2932
02:06:25,831 --> 02:06:26,650
talking about.
Again,

2933
02:06:26,650 --> 02:06:29,630
Nicola [inaudible] worlds are attacking 
people.

2934
02:06:37,770 --> 02:06:42,030
Speaking to Paige vanzant,
Michelle waterson.

2935
02:06:42,031 --> 02:06:43,860
Not to be confused with Michelle 
Waterman.

2936
02:06:45,330 --> 02:06:46,163
Ron Waterman,
a coca cola life cane sugar and Stevia 

2937
02:06:50,480 --> 02:06:52,140
bullshit.
Is this a new one?

2938
02:06:52,141 --> 02:06:54,330
To put Stevia?
Stevia is a good move.

2939
02:06:54,331 --> 02:06:57,200
But cane sugar and Stevia,
they put like a little,

2940
02:06:57,250 --> 02:06:59,640
a little dab of Stevia and a bucket of 
sugar.

2941
02:07:00,300 --> 02:07:03,620
Get that poison on my fucking face.
People know Z.

2942
02:07:03,640 --> 02:07:04,770
Do you,
have you ever tried that?

2943
02:07:05,250 --> 02:07:05,700
Oh,
look at that.

2944
02:07:05,700 --> 02:07:06,181
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

2945
02:07:06,181 --> 02:07:07,710
We have some here.
We have saw.

2946
02:07:07,900 --> 02:07:09,900
I love that stuff.
They sent me a bunch of it.

2947
02:07:10,670 --> 02:07:13,320
Not even paying me to say it.
And we drag it on air,

2948
02:07:13,380 --> 02:07:14,213
didn't we?
I Dunno.

2949
02:07:14,280 --> 02:07:17,220
What is it?
It's soda flavored with Stevia.

2950
02:07:17,250 --> 02:07:19,760
They make an energy drink.
It's good.

2951
02:07:20,260 --> 02:07:21,660
Stevie's good man.
I like it.

2952
02:07:21,690 --> 02:07:24,000
It doesn't fuck with you.
I like to put it in coffee.

2953
02:07:24,030 --> 02:07:24,863
Doesn't,
doesn't fuck with your blood sugar 

2954
02:07:25,951 --> 02:07:27,180
levels.
Tastes better.

2955
02:07:27,320 --> 02:07:27,770
I agree.
He's,

2956
02:07:27,770 --> 02:07:29,460
no,
it doesn't seem to have any negatives.

2957
02:07:29,700 --> 02:07:31,080
I mean,
I don't know what it's like if you abuse

2958
02:07:31,081 --> 02:07:33,260
it,
but I think he had a hundred oranges.

2959
02:07:33,270 --> 02:07:34,920
Your body's going to feel like shit.
I'll let you know.

2960
02:07:34,921 --> 02:07:35,930
Cause I abuse the shit out.

2961
02:07:36,280 --> 02:07:38,710
Yeah.
According to Dan Quinn now it's a,

2962
02:07:39,250 --> 02:07:40,210
yeah,
that guy is on the ball.

2963
02:07:40,930 --> 02:07:44,400
So let's talk about I'm dominick Cruz 
and cody garbrandt man.

2964
02:07:44,900 --> 02:07:45,733
Uh,
yeah,

2965
02:07:46,120 --> 02:07:48,400
two hours into the podcast people are 
like,

2966
02:07:48,401 --> 02:07:49,400
fuck,
fuck,

2967
02:07:49,401 --> 02:07:50,234
it's,
it's a boxing.

2968
02:07:51,760 --> 02:07:53,800
It's a Coke Cola.
But this is what happens when you have a

2969
02:07:53,801 --> 02:07:55,750
producer or like,
you know,

2970
02:07:55,840 --> 02:07:57,640
engineer or a rather,
uh,

2971
02:07:57,670 --> 02:07:58,503
executive.
Uh,

2972
02:07:58,510 --> 02:08:00,340
you look at the,
we'll get the money line code.

2973
02:08:00,341 --> 02:08:02,980
He's not that big of an underdog.
Well,

2974
02:08:02,981 --> 02:08:05,410
cody's fucking dangerous.
Super Dangerous.

2975
02:08:05,440 --> 02:08:06,450
Here's the question.
Like,

2976
02:08:06,451 --> 02:08:09,850
is he ever faced anybody that moves the 
way dominic does?

2977
02:08:09,880 --> 02:08:10,713
And we've seen with so many guys that 
they have a really hard time hitting 

2978
02:08:13,511 --> 02:08:15,700
dominic.
He's a really hard time to hit.

2979
02:08:15,701 --> 02:08:17,650
Okay,
so dominic is a two to one favorite,

2980
02:08:17,800 --> 02:08:19,270
correct?
You know,

2981
02:08:19,300 --> 02:08:21,190
which is a,
I'd say that's,

2982
02:08:21,610 --> 02:08:23,050
well,
cody's one 75,

2983
02:08:23,051 --> 02:08:23,884
so the real,
the real spread is only 35 cents on a 

2984
02:08:26,921 --> 02:08:28,360
dollar a dollar bet.

2985
02:08:28,390 --> 02:08:29,440
Not,
not crazy.

2986
02:08:29,460 --> 02:08:29,861
No.
That's swear.

2987
02:08:29,861 --> 02:08:32,560
She got good.
Dominic is what they're banking on.

2988
02:08:32,561 --> 02:08:33,040
I think.
You know,

2989
02:08:33,040 --> 02:08:35,920
cody hasn't Mizzou.
[inaudible] is best win,

2990
02:08:36,810 --> 02:08:39,940
which was his last fight.
So that's what got him this title shot.

2991
02:08:40,240 --> 02:08:42,580
Here's something bank on him landing on 
Dominic.

2992
02:08:42,670 --> 02:08:44,020
Here's something that people aren't 
talking about.

2993
02:08:44,021 --> 02:08:46,220
Linacre and Tj dillashaw is on the same 
card.

2994
02:08:46,221 --> 02:08:49,450
That's a crazy fucking fight.
Linacre scary.

2995
02:08:50,010 --> 02:08:52,120
Lineker super scary.
He's terrifying.

2996
02:08:52,540 --> 02:08:56,800
Building that little monkey.
He's built like a chimpanzee dude.

2997
02:08:56,801 --> 02:09:00,540
He like like a a pounder.
And when I say a little racist,

2998
02:09:00,550 --> 02:09:02,530
ladies and gentlemen,
I call myself a month 35.

2999
02:09:02,570 --> 02:09:05,800
Just want to specify Linacre wasn't any 
one 25.

3000
02:09:05,860 --> 02:09:07,060
Yes,
he was one 25.

3001
02:09:07,061 --> 02:09:07,894
You wouldn't make the way that he has.
He has a real talent and he has real 

3002
02:09:12,251 --> 02:09:15,220
power at that was scary.
Scary guy.

3003
02:09:15,280 --> 02:09:18,520
Hemmer cody's the hardest hitters.
That latter one fight.

3004
02:09:18,710 --> 02:09:19,340
[inaudible]

3005
02:09:19,340 --> 02:09:20,173
a different kind of hit her though.
I think cody is lightning fast and like 

3006
02:09:22,331 --> 02:09:24,370
beautiful combinations and beautiful 
footwork,

3007
02:09:24,400 --> 02:09:25,233
better technique.
The angles that he cut when he knocked 

3008
02:09:27,491 --> 02:09:28,360
out.
Um,

3009
02:09:28,390 --> 02:09:29,980
uh,
Thomas,

3010
02:09:29,981 --> 02:09:30,814
uh,
I made up when he knocked out Thomas 

3011
02:09:32,830 --> 02:09:33,663
Almeda like Amanda was undefeated,
very scary and he cut some serious 

3012
02:09:37,061 --> 02:09:38,710
fucking angles and drop some bombs on 
him.

3013
02:09:38,711 --> 02:09:39,520
I was like,
whoa.

3014
02:09:39,520 --> 02:09:43,510
Cody's back speed of entry.
His uncle was alternative Olympic boxer.

3015
02:09:43,540 --> 02:09:48,070
His Dad was a boxer and they just put 
this little ball of hate and to him,

3016
02:09:48,280 --> 02:09:49,113
but he's a ridiculous wrestler to his 
kind of knockout power is a different 

3017
02:09:52,781 --> 02:09:53,614
kind of knockout power.
Then Linacre Linacre is almost like a 

3018
02:09:56,321 --> 02:09:59,410
guy that is 20 or 30 pounds bigger than 
him.

3019
02:09:59,411 --> 02:10:01,930
It's weird like he hits guides and you 
see them like,

3020
02:10:02,130 --> 02:10:02,963
oh,
like he's hitting you on the arms with 

3021
02:10:04,811 --> 02:10:07,990
these bombs and he takes a shot 
extremely well.

3022
02:10:08,380 --> 02:10:11,690
Like when he fought a Francisco,
um,

3023
02:10:12,070 --> 02:10:13,160
when you,
when you watched the,

3024
02:10:13,170 --> 02:10:16,480
the combination of those two guys 
unloaded in the first round,

3025
02:10:16,481 --> 02:10:17,470
you're like,
Jesus Christ.

3026
02:10:17,471 --> 02:10:20,770
Francisco Rivera is a bad motherfucker,
a very good striker.

3027
02:10:21,070 --> 02:10:21,903
And he just decided to go to war with 
Linacre and Leonard who was just 

3028
02:10:24,670 --> 02:10:27,070
dropping bombs on them and you go,
Jesus,

3029
02:10:27,071 --> 02:10:30,820
he can do this even at one 35 maybe be 
even better at one 35.

3030
02:10:30,850 --> 02:10:32,770
I and I,
and I love to watch linacre fight.

3031
02:10:32,800 --> 02:10:33,633
I don't think in for right now,
I don't think could be championed with 

3032
02:10:36,981 --> 02:10:38,990
his,
with that style of fighting.

3033
02:10:39,670 --> 02:10:42,520
Don't and only boxing watch what 
happens.

3034
02:10:42,920 --> 02:10:43,753
Watch what happens when Tj,
cause it's easy to game plan for Tj and 

3035
02:10:46,701 --> 02:10:47,840
Dwayne lug width and go,
all right,

3036
02:10:47,960 --> 02:10:49,400
this is what we do and you're gonna see 
him.

3037
02:10:49,401 --> 02:10:50,234
Angles makes it it up.
I'm excited about it because I think tj 

3038
02:10:53,751 --> 02:10:55,520
spectacularly talented,
no doubt,

3039
02:10:55,521 --> 02:10:58,850
and Tj has amazing footwork and all 
that,

3040
02:10:58,880 --> 02:11:00,170
the Duane system.

3041
02:11:00,560 --> 02:11:02,030
But Leonard has got something special.
Man,

3042
02:11:02,050 --> 02:11:02,461
I'm,
I've,

3043
02:11:02,461 --> 02:11:05,990
I've very rarely seen a guy at his 
weight class that hits people the way he

3044
02:11:05,991 --> 02:11:07,100
does.
It's a very,

3045
02:11:07,101 --> 02:11:09,020
it's an almost like good,
he's doing a different thing.

3046
02:11:09,320 --> 02:11:10,153
Yeah.
It's different kind of months or those 

3047
02:11:11,600 --> 02:11:12,433
fights are very similar where cody 
garbrandt just needs one to win the 

3048
02:11:14,721 --> 02:11:16,730
fight.
Linacre needs one to win the fight.

3049
02:11:16,731 --> 02:11:20,210
Dominic Cruz footwork's ridiculous.
Tj dillashaw is footwork.

3050
02:11:20,240 --> 02:11:21,650
Ridiculous.
But you've got to think,

3051
02:11:21,680 --> 02:11:22,513
you know,
Tj Kol Hanan Barao twice dropped him in 

3052
02:11:24,771 --> 02:11:26,080
the first round with a straight right 
hand.

3053
02:11:26,090 --> 02:11:28,970
It's not like Tj doesn't have power and 
Tj hooker power,

3054
02:11:29,180 --> 02:11:30,013
he doesn't have the same kind of power,
but he's got way more options as far as 

3055
02:11:32,661 --> 02:11:33,830
movement,
you know?

3056
02:11:33,831 --> 02:11:34,664
So it's going to be very interesting to 
see how you have this movement came and 

3057
02:11:37,461 --> 02:11:40,040
remember that fight only three routes,
which hurts.

3058
02:11:40,220 --> 02:11:41,053
I finished Tj,
tj because he's got to survive the 

3059
02:11:43,791 --> 02:11:45,090
storm.
Yeah,

3060
02:11:45,500 --> 02:11:46,333
Tj because tj moves so good man is hard.
Like in the brow fight you saw it like 

3061
02:11:49,761 --> 02:11:50,530
right away,
browse.

3062
02:11:50,530 --> 02:11:54,260
Got that like linear style presses for 
five rounds though,

3063
02:11:54,261 --> 02:11:57,680
right of that footwork's gonna that's 
gonna be hard to follow.

3064
02:11:57,681 --> 02:12:01,170
If you're that straight forward pressure
fighter for championship rounds,

3065
02:12:01,171 --> 02:12:04,610
you're like Jesus Christ and starts 
wearing on you and then tj takes over.

3066
02:12:04,760 --> 02:12:06,170
That's interesting.
That's a good point.

3067
02:12:06,350 --> 02:12:08,120
I think Tj uh,
is,

3068
02:12:08,180 --> 02:12:12,800
is definitely in a tricky situation 
because he wanted that rematch,

3069
02:12:12,890 --> 02:12:13,723
wanted that title fight.
He was really close in the first fight 

3070
02:12:15,321 --> 02:12:17,220
with dominick Cruz.
It was a real close person.

3071
02:12:17,230 --> 02:12:19,520
You just told me they were like,
you won that fight.

3072
02:12:19,521 --> 02:12:21,710
I think Dana even agreed was like,
you won that fight man.

3073
02:12:21,760 --> 02:12:23,720
It's a very close fight,
no doubt about it.

3074
02:12:23,840 --> 02:12:24,673
Well,
whoever you believe won that fight and 

3075
02:12:25,521 --> 02:12:28,670
then dominic goes on and beat Shariah 
and beat them handily.

3076
02:12:28,820 --> 02:12:32,930
And now dominick is stepping in to fight
him and he's got a,

3077
02:12:32,931 --> 02:12:33,764
he's,
he's a fighting cody and he's got a 

3078
02:12:35,721 --> 02:12:36,554
really tough fight on that,
on that same card and a really tough 

3079
02:12:39,411 --> 02:12:42,680
fight where if he loses that fight,
fuck man back in the line.

3080
02:12:42,780 --> 02:12:43,613
This is,
and this is a guy with that is missed 

3081
02:12:44,660 --> 02:12:45,493
wait a couple of times and Linacre is 
like kind of tricky in that situation 

3082
02:12:48,111 --> 02:12:48,944
where he's Ms.
Wade if at featherweight or I miss wait 

3083
02:12:51,111 --> 02:12:53,780
rather at a flyweight yeah a couple of 
times.

3084
02:12:53,781 --> 02:12:56,830
And it hasn't he Ms.
Wade at Bantam weight to one.

3085
02:12:56,860 --> 02:12:57,693
Yeah.
So this is a guy that's going to come 

3086
02:12:59,091 --> 02:13:02,660
and biggest fuck is very dangerous.
Hit super hard.

3087
02:13:02,840 --> 02:13:05,730
Like in a creepy way.
Creepy hard almost.

3088
02:13:05,740 --> 02:13:08,150
So almost like a,
it's almost like a heavyweight fight for

3089
02:13:08,151 --> 02:13:10,580
Tj cause you make one mistake in lineker
lands,

3090
02:13:10,581 --> 02:13:11,414
it's over.

3091
02:13:11,960 --> 02:13:14,480
You're fighting dom,
you make some mistakes and get lit up.

3092
02:13:14,600 --> 02:13:18,260
He's not going to end your night show,
pull up linacre versus Macdonald.

3093
02:13:18,660 --> 02:13:22,960
Macdonald is a fucking straight killer.
That kid's a bad motherfuckers.

3094
02:13:22,980 --> 02:13:25,670
Yet the patient has had some injuries.
Yeah.

3095
02:13:25,710 --> 02:13:27,800
I had some injuries lost to Uriah.
Uriah mauled him.

3096
02:13:27,801 --> 02:13:29,600
That was the big one.
When you're I in Merch,

3097
02:13:29,610 --> 02:13:31,950
dumb cause that he finally came back and
then you at Merck dumb,

3098
02:13:31,951 --> 02:13:33,600
he went away.
It was one over your eyes.

3099
02:13:33,601 --> 02:13:35,120
Finest performances.
You're right.

3100
02:13:35,580 --> 02:13:36,413
Cracked him with a right hand,
got ahold of that neck and just put the 

3101
02:13:39,241 --> 02:13:41,150
full uriah on them as far as his,
uh,

3102
02:13:41,190 --> 02:13:42,023
his key,
a teen that mounted guillotine just 

3103
02:13:43,591 --> 02:13:44,424
fucking,
but it's almost like the one 35 

3104
02:13:45,721 --> 02:13:47,070
tournament cause you have,
you know,

3105
02:13:47,130 --> 02:13:50,340
you have a cody and dom,
they have Tj Linacre.

3106
02:13:50,700 --> 02:13:52,840
The loser's going to fight the loser 
winner's gonna fight the way.

3107
02:13:52,840 --> 02:13:53,860
Yeah,
let's watch,

3108
02:13:54,090 --> 02:13:55,980
check out that if you could to find that
fine.

3109
02:13:56,010 --> 02:13:56,843
Linacre versus Michael McDonald.
Kao I had it but it didn't pull up it 

3110
02:13:58,891 --> 02:14:02,290
wrong.
Fifer oh these sons of bitches areas.

3111
02:14:02,820 --> 02:14:06,000
So like Michael McDonald,
like real classical style,

3112
02:14:06,001 --> 02:14:09,570
real good at punching power.
Not built like a scary guy,

3113
02:14:09,571 --> 02:14:14,340
but a vicious knockout artists like one 
of those guys where the body really sort

3114
02:14:14,341 --> 02:14:14,790
of,
uh,

3115
02:14:14,790 --> 02:14:16,680
is uh,
is very deceptive.

3116
02:14:16,950 --> 02:14:19,150
And remember he was like top,
top prospect.

3117
02:14:19,980 --> 02:14:23,810
He was a big,
big prospect to see Uriah or Hanan Barao

3118
02:14:23,820 --> 02:14:25,680
first he lost a hand and Barao.
Right,

3119
02:14:25,710 --> 02:14:28,320
and then he came back and fought uriah.
Wasn't that the case?

3120
02:14:28,350 --> 02:14:30,390
How tall is linker?
He's short.

3121
02:14:30,420 --> 02:14:32,700
He's short,
but he's about the same height as dwight

3122
02:14:32,701 --> 02:14:34,870
cow.
Five says.

3123
02:14:35,970 --> 02:14:36,630
I don't know.
I don't,

3124
02:14:36,630 --> 02:14:37,590
they don't think he is.
Honestly.

3125
02:14:37,591 --> 02:14:40,050
I think he's five four.
He's a small little dude.

3126
02:14:40,080 --> 02:14:43,950
He's a small guy but hits like a fucking
mack truck.

3127
02:14:44,220 --> 02:14:48,840
Almost creepy in his power man.
Like and in so confident in it too.

3128
02:14:48,900 --> 02:14:49,733
But again,
to the point where I don't think he's 

3129
02:14:51,780 --> 02:14:52,613
going to be champ.
You look at a guy like John Dotson who 

3130
02:14:54,541 --> 02:14:57,540
just outworked them and I thought he 
lost that fight.

3131
02:14:57,630 --> 02:14:59,370
Granted they gave it to Lynika.
Yeah,

3132
02:14:59,371 --> 02:15:01,320
well it was close enough.
I mean,

3133
02:15:01,350 --> 02:15:02,040
oh look,
look,

3134
02:15:02,040 --> 02:15:03,000
he heard him there.
Look,

3135
02:15:03,030 --> 02:15:03,863
he heard him there.
You could see Mike McDowell steps back 

3136
02:15:05,521 --> 02:15:06,840
and it's like,
oh Jesus.

3137
02:15:07,140 --> 02:15:07,973
There's a feeling that guys get when he 
connects on them when you see it in 

3138
02:15:10,591 --> 02:15:11,341
their eyes.
So like,

3139
02:15:11,341 --> 02:15:14,640
Holy Shit,
this is a different thing here.

3140
02:15:14,700 --> 02:15:15,270
It's a,
it's a,

3141
02:15:15,270 --> 02:15:17,550
that's not snowflake.
That's not snowflake move.

3142
02:15:17,610 --> 02:15:18,421
Yeah,
no.

3143
02:15:18,421 --> 02:15:19,254
And he's,
he's also got a ridiculous Chin when he 

3144
02:15:21,361 --> 02:15:23,100
foot,
when he stood in front of Rivera,

3145
02:15:23,130 --> 02:15:24,390
it's going like this,
like,

3146
02:15:24,391 --> 02:15:24,810
come on.

3147
02:15:24,810 --> 02:15:29,040
They were just banging it out.
And Rivera fun but rare flattens people.

3148
02:15:29,130 --> 02:15:31,080
So as you watch like Linacre walk them 
down here,

3149
02:15:31,320 --> 02:15:34,440
you're looking at this kid who's just 
got unique power.

3150
02:15:34,520 --> 02:15:35,670
Well,
like really unique.

3151
02:15:35,671 --> 02:15:36,540
And even a guy like,
oh,

3152
02:15:36,541 --> 02:15:37,374
look at that.
Boom.

3153
02:15:37,560 --> 02:15:39,560
Michael McDonald recognize he goes down 
there,

3154
02:15:39,561 --> 02:15:40,500
I look,
he goes down again,

3155
02:15:40,530 --> 02:15:41,363
boom,
boom,

3156
02:15:41,400 --> 02:15:41,970
boom,
boom.

3157
02:15:41,970 --> 02:15:43,710
And linacre just stands in front of 
them,

3158
02:15:43,711 --> 02:15:46,350
bites on his mouthpiece and fucking 
malls on Mcdonald.

3159
02:15:46,351 --> 02:15:49,020
Landed one deal and Linacre ate it like 
a tic TAC.

3160
02:15:49,021 --> 02:15:51,090
And he's moving forward.
Boom,

3161
02:15:51,220 --> 02:15:53,400
take home.
And he rocks him again.

3162
02:15:53,610 --> 02:15:58,610
And he's just undeniably confidence in 
his ability to walk you down and smash.

3163
02:15:59,371 --> 02:16:00,204
You.
See what you can't do as loan back yet 

3164
02:16:02,071 --> 02:16:03,840
and get your back against the kids.
You gotta move,

3165
02:16:03,841 --> 02:16:06,600
man.
See I've heard him again times more,

3166
02:16:07,110 --> 02:16:09,780
10 times more,
100% but the question is,

3167
02:16:10,020 --> 02:16:10,853
is there going to be exchanges were 
dillashaw is inside of his range and 

3168
02:16:13,591 --> 02:16:16,680
we'll one of these things land and once 
one of those things do land,

3169
02:16:16,681 --> 02:16:19,410
we'll dillashaw continue to engage the 
same way like boom,

3170
02:16:19,411 --> 02:16:20,190
boom,
boom.

3171
02:16:20,190 --> 02:16:21,023
Or will it be over right lands.
But tj takes a good shot and has never 

3172
02:16:24,091 --> 02:16:27,480
been a guy to stand in front of you like
this and Oh look at that.

3173
02:16:27,650 --> 02:16:32,110
And we see his head gets snapped out.
What [inaudible] talking about.

3174
02:16:32,550 --> 02:16:36,040
It's very rare that anybody has that 
kind of destroying power.

3175
02:16:36,090 --> 02:16:38,170
Remember that?
Remember Tj can wrestle too,

3176
02:16:38,171 --> 02:16:40,060
so if they're getting close he'll take 
his ass down.

3177
02:16:40,480 --> 02:16:41,313
The difference between him and Dotson at
one 35 and I liked Dotson at 35 I think 

3178
02:16:44,621 --> 02:16:45,454
he's better at 35 then 25 I just think 
he just kills himself too much to make 

3179
02:16:48,611 --> 02:16:49,444
that weight.
Like when you fought GAM Berrien is 

3180
02:16:50,530 --> 02:16:53,890
dotson can sneak in on you and your son 
too.

3181
02:16:54,250 --> 02:16:55,083
And when they fought,
did they fight at 35 or 25 when it came 

3182
02:16:57,811 --> 02:16:59,450
bands and,
and uh,

3183
02:16:59,600 --> 02:17:04,600
and Linacre fought does at 25.
Is it 100% of the 25?

3184
02:17:05,110 --> 02:17:05,980
Yeah.
Is it,

3185
02:17:06,010 --> 02:17:06,843
you might be right.
I don't think that's the right weight 

3186
02:17:08,320 --> 02:17:11,320
class for dots.
And I think Dodson we'd be at both guys.

3187
02:17:11,350 --> 02:17:14,890
I think both guys were way better off 
without destroying themselves.

3188
02:17:14,891 --> 02:17:15,724
Those are fun fights man.
And then on the pre the fs one prelims 

3189
02:17:18,581 --> 02:17:20,950
are stacked.
You got Neil magni versa.

3190
02:17:21,100 --> 02:17:24,860
What's that catch weight?
One 36 and a half wait or no?

3191
02:17:26,320 --> 02:17:28,590
So it must've been like a last minute 
decision to,

3192
02:17:28,630 --> 02:17:29,463
to have that fight.
So That's interesting that Dodson and 

3193
02:17:31,451 --> 02:17:33,520
him went to war and linear one that 
decision.

3194
02:17:33,670 --> 02:17:34,780
Yes,
I 35,

3195
02:17:35,160 --> 02:17:36,260
but I thought,
um,

3196
02:17:36,670 --> 02:17:37,680
you talked about some one.
Yeah.

3197
02:17:38,200 --> 02:17:39,910
Um,
here's the other thing about Tj.

3198
02:17:39,911 --> 02:17:40,744
You got to think how long has tj really 
been with Duane Ludwig and he continues 

3199
02:17:43,001 --> 02:17:45,250
to get better with Duane Ludwig?
It's only been a few years.

3200
02:17:45,520 --> 02:17:48,340
So in the last couple of years,
like we,

3201
02:17:48,350 --> 02:17:48,941
you know,
we will do,

3202
02:17:48,941 --> 02:17:49,774
we've seen,
we've seen the two big fights with Hana 

3203
02:17:51,070 --> 02:17:52,720
barrao where he marked him,
right,

3204
02:17:52,750 --> 02:17:55,570
which are the all time career highlight 
performances.

3205
02:17:55,570 --> 02:17:56,403
Right.
Joe especially the second one that Joe 

3206
02:17:57,670 --> 02:17:58,503
Soto fight,
which was an interesting fight because 

3207
02:17:59,470 --> 02:18:02,130
taking a real tough guy on a real short 
notice today,

3208
02:18:02,140 --> 02:18:06,280
none day,
one day during the way in trying to make

3209
02:18:06,281 --> 02:18:07,114
weight falls asleep and bangs his head 
on the wall because he cut too much 

3210
02:18:09,461 --> 02:18:11,140
weight.
Joe Soto steps in.

3211
02:18:11,350 --> 02:18:14,170
And so tj makes that adjustment,
wins that fight coming back,

3212
02:18:14,590 --> 02:18:17,740
beats the shit out of Barao and the 
rematch like really dominated him in the

3213
02:18:17,741 --> 02:18:19,030
rematch.
Those are like,

3214
02:18:19,180 --> 02:18:21,130
you know,
real highlight reel finishes,

3215
02:18:21,280 --> 02:18:23,290
all three of those fights.
So then,

3216
02:18:23,320 --> 02:18:24,250
uh,
he goes from that,

3217
02:18:24,251 --> 02:18:28,680
the really close lost to Dominick Cruz 
and then beats a sun sal.

3218
02:18:28,750 --> 02:18:31,230
Like he took a chance with a sun sal.
A sense.

3219
02:18:32,040 --> 02:18:33,700
Yeah.
He beat us on site,

3220
02:18:33,720 --> 02:18:34,553
look better in the sun south fight.
Then he did in the first time they 

3221
02:18:36,161 --> 02:18:38,290
fought.
So he's showing improvement just in that

3222
02:18:38,291 --> 02:18:38,910
fight.

3223
02:18:38,910 --> 02:18:41,860
You just got to wonder what this is 
going to look like,

3224
02:18:41,861 --> 02:18:43,330
what linacre versus him is going to look
like.

3225
02:18:43,331 --> 02:18:44,620
Very,
very interesting fight.

3226
02:18:44,770 --> 02:18:46,330
Great.
Matchups fuck yeah.

3227
02:18:46,420 --> 02:18:47,253
That one particular,
what do you think about cody and 

3228
02:18:49,121 --> 02:18:49,954
Dominic?
Do you think the code he's going to be 

3229
02:18:50,741 --> 02:18:51,574
able to,
like when you look at cody move and you 

3230
02:18:53,081 --> 02:18:53,914
see his success against guys like to 
Gawky against guys like Thomas Almeda 

3231
02:18:57,580 --> 02:19:00,520
and then you see what dominic does to 
people.

3232
02:19:00,700 --> 02:19:02,080
He's in front of you.
He's not.

3233
02:19:02,110 --> 02:19:03,940
He's,
he's shuffling stances.

3234
02:19:04,060 --> 02:19:06,310
He's off to the side.
He's got his hands down.

3235
02:19:06,430 --> 02:19:08,680
He's moving in this really fucking weird
way.

3236
02:19:08,681 --> 02:19:11,890
That's real tough to emulate.
I love cody,

3237
02:19:12,160 --> 02:19:13,900
but the x factor,
here's,

3238
02:19:13,960 --> 02:19:16,330
we haven't really seen them.
Faith top competition.

3239
02:19:16,600 --> 02:19:17,950
Mizzou [inaudible].
He's older.

3240
02:19:18,070 --> 02:19:20,570
He got merck before from Dominic.
Ben.

3241
02:19:20,571 --> 02:19:23,470
He gets murked by cody.
We saw promise in Almeda.

3242
02:19:23,500 --> 02:19:25,930
We saw him fight a really promising God.
Again,

3243
02:19:25,931 --> 02:19:28,250
young guy,
not level of dominick Cruz

3244
02:19:28,280 --> 02:19:29,990
or we haven't seen with the movement.
Right?

3245
02:19:30,500 --> 02:19:32,900
The thing that I like about cody,
so damn game,

3246
02:19:32,901 --> 02:19:35,720
I was talking to a lance palmer at team 
alpha male and they're like,

3247
02:19:35,900 --> 02:19:37,850
we've never seen theme like it,
like fight week.

3248
02:19:37,910 --> 02:19:40,460
If he sees someone and he needs to work 
on this,

3249
02:19:40,640 --> 02:19:42,100
but he's just young and hungry.
He goes,

3250
02:19:42,101 --> 02:19:44,780
if he sees someone from the other camp,
he tries to fight them in the hallway.

3251
02:19:44,960 --> 02:19:48,950
He's just like this pit bull man and 
he's just so god competitive.

3252
02:19:49,190 --> 02:19:49,990
They're like,
wait,

3253
02:19:49,990 --> 02:19:52,640
we have to have a coach with them at all
times,

3254
02:19:52,880 --> 02:19:54,080
author.
He won't leave.

3255
02:19:54,290 --> 02:19:55,123
He won't leave the gym.
If you see someone else from the camp 

3256
02:19:57,291 --> 02:19:58,124
tries and fight some,
but don't think that that's a waste of 

3257
02:19:59,901 --> 02:20:01,610
energy.
100% he's young.

3258
02:20:01,730 --> 02:20:03,830
He's young.
It could be an exaggeration though.

3259
02:20:03,870 --> 02:20:04,703
Could be for sure.
You have had a problem with one dude 

3260
02:20:06,381 --> 02:20:06,720
once.

3261
02:20:06,720 --> 02:20:09,230
We're sure Friday bravo now a sudden 
talking.

3262
02:20:09,231 --> 02:20:13,580
Reasonable now taught now.
Now talking common sense.

3263
02:20:14,140 --> 02:20:14,973
That sounds like fake news.
Let's go over the rest of the car and 

3264
02:20:17,751 --> 02:20:18,770
popped the whole card.
Jamie.

3265
02:20:18,890 --> 02:20:20,700
The big thing on this is,
um,

3266
02:20:20,930 --> 02:20:22,760
can cody Land Kenny?
But Kenny,

3267
02:20:22,761 --> 02:20:24,090
keep up for again,
five.

3268
02:20:24,110 --> 02:20:26,810
It's five rounds.
It's five fucking rounds,

3269
02:20:26,811 --> 02:20:27,644
man.
Do you think about anything about these 

3270
02:20:31,151 --> 02:20:32,450
guys?
They're both real good man.

3271
02:20:32,720 --> 02:20:33,553
They're both real good,
good ground fighters to Louis Mocha and 

3272
02:20:35,721 --> 02:20:37,490
Ray Borg.
That should be a very interesting fight.

3273
02:20:37,520 --> 02:20:38,990
Fun Fight.
This card.

3274
02:20:38,991 --> 02:20:40,660
It sucks.
Cause how about Canaan?

3275
02:20:40,920 --> 02:20:43,760
Verdo [inaudible] the guy that pulled 
out on a,

3276
02:20:43,761 --> 02:20:45,950
he was supposed to be fighting,
um,

3277
02:20:46,190 --> 02:20:48,800
uh,
Ian and pull down on real short notice.

3278
02:20:48,860 --> 02:20:51,740
Remember that smoke?
It was fun to watch or got hurt.

3279
02:20:51,760 --> 02:20:52,593
He's really both fun to watch as small.
Got For an American Russian or actually 

3280
02:20:56,151 --> 02:20:58,460
from the eastern bloc?
No,

3281
02:20:58,461 --> 02:21:00,350
he's American American.
He's like,

3282
02:21:00,710 --> 02:21:02,300
yeah.
Where's Louis [inaudible]?

3283
02:21:03,560 --> 02:21:04,890
I Dunno where Louis is from.
It.

3284
02:21:04,900 --> 02:21:07,520
What sucks is cane for doom off.
That'd be fun.

3285
02:21:08,300 --> 02:21:09,000
Hawaii.
Oh,

3286
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:09,890
he's Hawaiian.
That's right.

3287
02:21:10,070 --> 02:21:10,970
Dot.
Last Samurai.

3288
02:21:10,971 --> 02:21:12,410
That's why it's Da.
That's right.

3289
02:21:12,680 --> 02:21:15,400
His Dad's probably rushing them.
Sao Dare you come on.

3290
02:21:15,410 --> 02:21:16,730
Small gun.
Is that a,

3291
02:21:16,731 --> 02:21:18,660
is that a Russian name?
Hell yeah.

3292
02:21:18,661 --> 02:21:21,950
You go back to that on man.
I don't know anything.

3293
02:21:22,730 --> 02:21:24,200
Smoker,
smoker.

3294
02:21:24,410 --> 02:21:25,340
What is that?
Uh,

3295
02:21:25,430 --> 02:21:29,030
when you say it like that,
that on slide done it smoke a bro.

3296
02:21:29,420 --> 02:21:30,830
Um,
whereas where's,

3297
02:21:30,831 --> 02:21:34,730
what's his ethnicity?
It just might be Hawaiian dude.

3298
02:21:34,790 --> 02:21:36,620
He might just be straight Hawaiian.
Get on Brazil.

3299
02:21:36,630 --> 02:21:39,170
And his nickname is a wiki page.
Does he have a weed smoke?

3300
02:21:39,250 --> 02:21:42,230
You might be a mad stoner and he's 
Hawaiian is fuck yeah,

3301
02:21:42,231 --> 02:21:44,540
he looks pretty fucking Hawaiians are 
killing it,

3302
02:21:44,541 --> 02:21:45,530
huh?
Holloway.

3303
02:21:45,560 --> 02:21:46,400
Oh yeah,
man.

3304
02:21:46,430 --> 02:21:47,263
Well that's a crazy island.
When you're stuck on an island with 

3305
02:21:49,251 --> 02:21:52,430
dudes and you got a problem with them,
you can't just fucking drive away.

3306
02:21:52,940 --> 02:21:54,530
Like that's a completely different 
mindset.

3307
02:21:54,531 --> 02:21:55,550
You can't drive way.
Got It.

3308
02:21:55,850 --> 02:21:56,683
I'll live in an island.
You're hanging out together on a 

3309
02:21:58,491 --> 02:21:59,324
volcano.
It doesn't say anything about his 

3310
02:22:00,951 --> 02:22:02,600
ethnicity.
He's Hawaiian,

3311
02:22:02,601 --> 02:22:03,650
Bro.
That's why this shit,

3312
02:22:03,651 --> 02:22:04,790
man.
Let's go to the uh,

3313
02:22:04,791 --> 02:22:06,380
Amanda Nunez.
Ronda rousey fight.

3314
02:22:07,190 --> 02:22:09,680
If you got to put some money down,
what do you,

3315
02:22:09,710 --> 02:22:11,360
what do you think,
man?

3316
02:22:11,390 --> 02:22:15,290
Who the fuck knows?
I love saying who the fuck knows because

3317
02:22:15,550 --> 02:22:16,383
you,
we haven't seen Ronda fight in over a 

3318
02:22:17,841 --> 02:22:19,300
year.
We don't need your head.

3319
02:22:19,340 --> 02:22:21,980
They're looking at her body.
She's in insane shape.

3320
02:22:22,160 --> 02:22:22,993
There's a pictures of her online 
throwing punches and you look at her 

3321
02:22:25,020 --> 02:22:25,681
back,
you're like,

3322
02:22:25,681 --> 02:22:26,170
yeah,
oh,

3323
02:22:26,170 --> 02:22:28,410
leash and seen him.
She's down.

3324
02:22:28,620 --> 02:22:29,850
She's down to fight.
Wake.

3325
02:22:30,060 --> 02:22:30,893
Wait already apparently you know,
I think losing to someone like Holly 

3326
02:22:35,880 --> 02:22:40,230
Holm the way she did and to be tired and
get beat up and the whole deal like look

3327
02:22:40,231 --> 02:22:41,790
at her back there,
which was punching the speed bag.

3328
02:22:41,820 --> 02:22:43,190
Jesus,
that's,

3329
02:22:43,830 --> 02:22:45,520
that's ridiculous.
Damn.

3330
02:22:46,050 --> 02:22:46,883
So if you think about the way she lost 
that fight and how she looked 

3331
02:22:51,001 --> 02:22:52,800
physically,
she didn't look nothing like this.

3332
02:22:52,860 --> 02:22:53,693
Like not even close.
Like she's got all these videos of her 

3333
02:22:55,771 --> 02:22:57,540
running up hills and all this different 
stuff.

3334
02:22:57,780 --> 02:22:58,613
She looks like way more fit.
She got tired in the fight with holly 

3335
02:23:01,861 --> 02:23:05,120
and that was a big factor is also 
getting hit was a big factor.

3336
02:23:05,220 --> 02:23:09,780
Getting stunned right away and but 
really solid conditioning will allow you

3337
02:23:09,781 --> 02:23:11,880
to recover better than not being in such
good shape.

3338
02:23:11,910 --> 02:23:14,000
Especially when you get hit in the Ed.
It's a,

3339
02:23:14,001 --> 02:23:16,050
a big factor with the guys that are 
super,

3340
02:23:16,051 --> 02:23:19,080
super fit is how they bounce back.
You know,

3341
02:23:19,081 --> 02:23:19,890
like,
um,

3342
02:23:19,890 --> 02:23:20,723
Neil Magni is a good example.
You can stun that guy in the first 

3343
02:23:22,501 --> 02:23:23,580
round,
but he's so fit.

3344
02:23:23,581 --> 02:23:26,070
He bounces back for her to that,
that holly fight.

3345
02:23:26,090 --> 02:23:27,740
You should,
the one thing that Ron,

3346
02:23:27,750 --> 02:23:29,610
she always comes to fight.
She's always in shape.

3347
02:23:29,611 --> 02:23:31,010
She takes that,
you know,

3348
02:23:31,110 --> 02:23:32,000
personal,
it takes it,

3349
02:23:32,290 --> 02:23:33,123
it Kinda upon herself.
She did not have the same sort of 

3350
02:23:35,161 --> 02:23:38,610
dedication towards that fight with holly
that she's got towards this fight.

3351
02:23:38,880 --> 02:23:41,310
Physically it doesn't let us think.
We know physically.

3352
02:23:41,311 --> 02:23:42,144
You can say that,
but we don't know cause she'd been 

3353
02:23:42,811 --> 02:23:44,320
shooting movies.
She won't do Prescott.

3354
02:23:44,420 --> 02:23:45,091
Right.
You know what I'm saying?

3355
02:23:45,091 --> 02:23:48,240
So we don't know.
She could take her down her judo and not

3356
02:23:48,241 --> 02:23:50,130
try to strike with,
they're just clinch up.

3357
02:23:50,670 --> 02:23:52,890
Do that judo trip.
Take her down.

3358
02:23:53,850 --> 02:23:57,040
Anybody's in danger of that arm bar.
That's what she's so god,

3359
02:23:57,350 --> 02:23:59,970
she's going to mandan and this could 
easily get caught in that arm bar.

3360
02:23:59,971 --> 02:24:01,490
Wouldn't shock.
Here's a question for age.

3361
02:24:01,491 --> 02:24:03,030
He's got to drag her down.
Here's a question.

3362
02:24:03,030 --> 02:24:03,863
Where do you guys,
do you think she has the coaching to 

3363
02:24:06,481 --> 02:24:07,314
make changes where she just doesn't pull
forward on a man Nunez and get punched 

3364
02:24:10,741 --> 02:24:12,110
in the face course she's going to 
become,

3365
02:24:12,300 --> 02:24:13,133
of course she's going to take her time.
Of course she's not going to go out 

3366
02:24:15,151 --> 02:24:17,160
there reckless.
She's going to take your time.

3367
02:24:17,161 --> 02:24:19,050
That's how she came round around Shit 
anyways,

3368
02:24:19,110 --> 02:24:21,870
and it seems like common sense.
Don't fucking get crazy.

3369
02:24:21,871 --> 02:24:23,930
Get in there.
Just fucking get the blood going.

3370
02:24:23,940 --> 02:24:25,260
That's not her.
That's not her.

3371
02:24:25,261 --> 02:24:26,550
Eddie.
She didn't get to man.

3372
02:24:26,551 --> 02:24:29,280
That's a guy named Mike Tyson.
Gay Sound Outside and Jab and do.

3373
02:24:29,281 --> 02:24:31,560
She might try to overwhelm arm,
but she's not stupid.

3374
02:24:31,561 --> 02:24:35,310
She's going to learn from mistakes.
They just fight a cleaner fight.

3375
02:24:35,311 --> 02:24:37,050
More movement,
more head movement.

3376
02:24:37,680 --> 02:24:39,900
The surgery,
she's had knee surgery since then.

3377
02:24:39,960 --> 02:24:40,793
She could take Amanda down.
I think she can take cat cat cats in 

3378
02:24:46,441 --> 02:24:47,274
Ghana had a real hard first round and 
the first round Amanda Nunez is beaten 

3379
02:24:49,941 --> 02:24:51,720
the shit out of her cat Nunez.
[inaudible]

3380
02:24:51,750 --> 02:24:55,810
Nunez.
Cat Cat came back and stop new needs.

3381
02:24:56,100 --> 02:25:00,180
That's either I got her on the back for 
a cardio.

3382
02:25:00,400 --> 02:25:01,950
If,
if Rhonda,

3383
02:25:02,120 --> 02:25:02,953
again,
it's tough because what makes Rhonda 

3384
02:25:04,051 --> 02:25:06,480
great is there's this flurry,
there's the exchange.

3385
02:25:06,540 --> 02:25:09,190
Next thing you know you're f she fucking
hip toss you and you're an armbar.

3386
02:25:09,270 --> 02:25:10,103
Right.
And that's the thing.

3387
02:25:10,110 --> 02:25:11,490
She's not really going to sit on 
outside.

3388
02:25:11,491 --> 02:25:12,690
Be patient.
That's not her.

3389
02:25:12,930 --> 02:25:15,900
But if she can like if it's a dog fight,
I think Rhonda,

3390
02:25:15,901 --> 02:25:18,090
I ended up catching a fourth or fifth 
round cause Amanda,

3391
02:25:18,091 --> 02:25:20,750
she starts off like a tidal wave and 
we've seen it in her losses.

3392
02:25:20,760 --> 02:25:22,890
She kind of slows down.
She just does.

3393
02:25:23,140 --> 02:25:24,850
Yeah.
Well it's going to be interesting to see

3394
02:25:24,851 --> 02:25:27,370
if American top team has been able to do
something to mitigate that.

3395
02:25:27,430 --> 02:25:28,263
If they've,
who knows what kind of strength 

3396
02:25:29,501 --> 02:25:30,880
conditioning program she's under now.

3397
02:25:31,060 --> 02:25:32,920
The only problem,
I see it quite as quick.

3398
02:25:33,420 --> 02:25:35,650
If Rhonda takes her down and ends up on 
top,

3399
02:25:36,670 --> 02:25:40,420
she might have a hard time passing 
Amanda Nunez Guard and we'll see.

3400
02:25:40,620 --> 02:25:44,410
Like Rhonda is not,
she's not known for guard passing,

3401
02:25:44,411 --> 02:25:47,290
so that could be a problem.
Maybe she'd shake Craig scrambles Eddie.

3402
02:25:47,560 --> 02:25:50,650
That's her thing,
but it's a letter to him to get up.

3403
02:25:50,680 --> 02:25:53,590
If she can get her on her back,
how will she,

3404
02:25:53,680 --> 02:25:56,800
she deal with passing the guard.
She really doesn't.

3405
02:25:56,801 --> 02:25:59,380
She goes to it and then she's going to 
transition from there.

3406
02:25:59,410 --> 02:26:01,420
You got to deal with it.
With a black belt in Jujitsu,

3407
02:26:01,540 --> 02:26:02,830
you're going to have to deal with the 
guard pass.

3408
02:26:02,831 --> 02:26:05,590
It's nine to really does submit anybody.
It's not a fee.

3409
02:26:06,270 --> 02:26:07,750
Rhonda could get on top of her that 
well.

3410
02:26:07,751 --> 02:26:09,760
She is a black male shape.
She submitted me.

3411
02:26:09,761 --> 02:26:10,420
She tape.

3412
02:26:10,420 --> 02:26:13,600
She's a black belt in Jujitsu and a 
chair after mcmahon too.

3413
02:26:14,230 --> 02:26:15,063
She battered both of them and submit 
both their asses and then different 

3414
02:26:18,221 --> 02:26:19,990
submission that she submits.
Her Mcmahon.

3415
02:26:20,300 --> 02:26:23,260
She submitted a cat.
Definitely have submitted Misha.

3416
02:26:23,750 --> 02:26:24,850
I got beat her up.
No,

3417
02:26:24,851 --> 02:26:25,631
not cat.
I'm sorry.

3418
02:26:25,631 --> 02:26:28,000
She submitted me Hsa.
She submitted Nisha,

3419
02:26:28,030 --> 02:26:30,130
that whole thing.
She did the same thing to Sarah McMahon.

3420
02:26:30,131 --> 02:26:33,460
I think she cracked her and then and 
then put her away with a choke.

3421
02:26:33,760 --> 02:26:36,490
The one pretty sure the one thing she 
has over Rhonda in this fight,

3422
02:26:36,491 --> 02:26:38,290
it's power.
She has vicious power.

3423
02:26:38,470 --> 02:26:40,240
Striking.
And I say that's it.

3424
02:26:40,270 --> 02:26:43,570
I'd say that if Rhonda does come at her 
full clip like that,

3425
02:26:43,870 --> 02:26:47,410
it's a very risky proposition.
She can crack so fucking hard.

3426
02:26:47,740 --> 02:26:49,720
But if Rhonda feels like she can get 
closer to that,

3427
02:26:49,721 --> 02:26:51,390
here we go.
He's not shocking,

3428
02:26:51,450 --> 02:26:54,100
man.
Punch.

3429
02:26:54,100 --> 02:26:55,660
Right?
She's not scary.

3430
02:26:55,750 --> 02:26:57,590
Oh yeah.
No,

3431
02:26:57,650 --> 02:26:59,530
she's talking about Amanda.
Amanda Nunez.

3432
02:26:59,540 --> 02:27:01,900
So she's working girls.
Only one shot.

3433
02:27:01,901 --> 02:27:03,760
She's dropping them.
And Shanna Blazer.

3434
02:27:05,160 --> 02:27:06,280
No,
she's marking girls.

3435
02:27:07,750 --> 02:27:08,291
Yeah,
she needed,

3436
02:27:08,291 --> 02:27:12,400
Amanda does clench a punch as hard as 
any fucking woman in that division.

3437
02:27:12,430 --> 02:27:15,980
She might be the hardest women puncher 
in the 135 she's the hardest one.

3438
02:27:15,981 --> 02:27:18,310
And punched her outside of Cyborg.
We'll sidewalks.

3439
02:27:18,320 --> 02:27:20,860
Not One 35 just saying females in 
general.

3440
02:27:20,861 --> 02:27:23,620
She's the hardest punch outs.
Sideboards of difference.

3441
02:27:25,220 --> 02:27:27,220
You want to see her fight.
Watch this in my mind.

3442
02:27:27,221 --> 02:27:28,970
Stays the same.
Do you see the fight with me?

3443
02:27:29,140 --> 02:27:31,570
I agree.
Did you see her fight with me Sha Amanda

3444
02:27:31,570 --> 02:27:32,270
Nunez?
Nisha?

3445
02:27:32,270 --> 02:27:33,430
I,
yes,

3446
02:27:33,431 --> 02:27:35,120
but I forgot all about,
uh,

3447
02:27:35,570 --> 02:27:37,720
Amanda knew this.
Stopping Misha.

3448
02:27:37,721 --> 02:27:40,890
She beat her up.
She wanted to know.

3449
02:27:41,740 --> 02:27:43,480
Okay.
What about the Sarah McMahon fight?

3450
02:27:43,680 --> 02:27:46,510
I don't know.
200 go before that.

3451
02:27:46,511 --> 02:27:50,050
Because before that is when she was beat
her up on the feet.

3452
02:27:51,270 --> 02:27:51,910
Yeah,
I was there.

3453
02:27:51,910 --> 02:27:54,130
She's got a nasty jab to match.
He steps in.

3454
02:27:54,131 --> 02:27:56,170
I'm going to distance to boom,
boom.

3455
02:27:56,730 --> 02:27:58,420
Good scramble.
The question is like,

3456
02:27:58,450 --> 02:28:00,610
is she going to,
there's a big difference between dealing

3457
02:28:00,611 --> 02:28:02,730
with Rhonda and dealing with Misha.
Look,

3458
02:28:02,780 --> 02:28:05,550
this is a mauling man.
She beat the brakes off of her.

3459
02:28:06,050 --> 02:28:07,540
Amanda.
It's just putting it to me.

3460
02:28:07,541 --> 02:28:08,374
Should tape and you just,
she just has long ass punches too and 

3461
02:28:11,651 --> 02:28:14,800
then she gets her back.
This size sounds out,

3462
02:28:14,870 --> 02:28:15,703
if Rhonda is in the right frame of mind,
I think she does Russia and like she 

3463
02:28:18,491 --> 02:28:20,890
usually does,
probably eats a shot,

3464
02:28:20,920 --> 02:28:22,130
but then she gets inside,

3465
02:28:22,130 --> 02:28:22,963
gets thrown under hook,
takes her for a ride and submits in the 

3466
02:28:24,201 --> 02:28:24,801
first round.
God,

3467
02:28:24,801 --> 02:28:29,750
I hope nobody tests positive for 
anything to so many people to in pop.

3468
02:28:29,860 --> 02:28:31,390
How about sideboard?
Yeah,

3469
02:28:31,660 --> 02:28:32,391
yeah.
Game.

3470
02:28:32,391 --> 02:28:33,800
Oh No,
no matter what.

3471
02:28:33,801 --> 02:28:38,230
It's for game fucking over men.
Now everyone's goes told Ya fucking told

3472
02:28:38,231 --> 02:28:39,360
Ya.
I just borrow.

3473
02:28:39,370 --> 02:28:41,480
No.
Lactone is what they're saying it is.

3474
02:28:41,800 --> 02:28:45,980
So Berona lactones a dht inhibitor,
which is a derivative of testosterone.

3475
02:28:45,981 --> 02:28:48,740
Dihydrotestosterone I used to rub that 
shit on my head.

3476
02:28:48,770 --> 02:28:49,603
Excuse me.
I was trying to keep my hair from 

3477
02:28:50,271 --> 02:28:52,370
falling out because of testosterone.
Yeah,

3478
02:28:52,640 --> 02:28:54,200
yeah.
If you have the gene for it,

3479
02:28:54,440 --> 02:28:57,590
dihydrotestosterone is what?
Both of you beautiful heads of hair.

3480
02:28:57,591 --> 02:28:59,420
Don't have that as my,
come on dude,

3481
02:28:59,820 --> 02:29:02,180
come on.
My hair is falling out like it's fine.

3482
02:29:02,181 --> 02:29:03,350
No,
almost 50.

3483
02:29:03,500 --> 02:29:05,180
His hair's beautiful.
Thanks man.

3484
02:29:05,420 --> 02:29:06,080
Thank you.

3485
02:29:06,080 --> 02:29:07,100
Thank you.
[inaudible] dead.

3486
02:29:07,130 --> 02:29:10,640
[inaudible] dead wasteland.
When I was a kid or when I was in my,

3487
02:29:10,641 --> 02:29:12,860
um,
I guess I was probably in my twenties,

3488
02:29:12,890 --> 02:29:13,550
I would,
uh,

3489
02:29:13,550 --> 02:29:14,383
rub this spirono lock Tane on my fucking
scalp because it's a dht inhibitor and 

3490
02:29:18,891 --> 02:29:19,724
it inhibits dht.
So when people take steroids or a woman 

3491
02:29:24,051 --> 02:29:27,770
takes steroids or a man who has that 
gene where the hair falls out,

3492
02:29:27,830 --> 02:29:30,290
and if a man has that gene and he takes 
steroids is probably even worse.

3493
02:29:30,680 --> 02:29:35,180
But if you rub that spironolactone on,
it has a dht inhibiting effect.

3494
02:29:35,540 --> 02:29:38,270
And I think if you take it orally,
it also,

3495
02:29:38,300 --> 02:29:41,030
um,
it acts as a diuretic.

3496
02:29:41,600 --> 02:29:42,500
And,
um,

3497
02:29:42,560 --> 02:29:43,760
there's also,
uh,

3498
02:29:43,790 --> 02:29:44,623
some uses as a masking agent.
There's a whole bunch of different uses 

3499
02:29:47,541 --> 02:29:48,980
of this,
like as a diuretic.

3500
02:29:48,981 --> 02:29:53,100
It also has benefits as a masking agent 
and it also mitigates the effects of,

3501
02:29:53,120 --> 02:29:55,400
uh,
of taking steroids in females.

3502
02:29:55,670 --> 02:29:58,490
So there's a lot of stuff going on,
red flags with that stuff.

3503
02:29:58,520 --> 02:30:01,160
But the one on her side that she says it
is,

3504
02:30:01,340 --> 02:30:03,170
is that it's a,
it's used as a diuretic,

3505
02:30:03,171 --> 02:30:04,940
which appears to be true.
That'd be great.

3506
02:30:05,120 --> 02:30:08,420
She has a rise in and fights Gabi Garcia
think about that.

3507
02:30:08,450 --> 02:30:09,283
But what she said,
she had some issues with their friends 

3508
02:30:11,991 --> 02:30:12,824
and their friends.
She had some pet issues with birth 

3509
02:30:14,931 --> 02:30:18,860
control pills and then she was bloated 
because of birth control pills.

3510
02:30:18,861 --> 02:30:21,110
So a doctor prescribed this to her off 
season,

3511
02:30:21,530 --> 02:30:24,380
which is to try to deal with a look.
I don't know,

3512
02:30:24,381 --> 02:30:25,850
I ain't never cut that kind of weight 
before.

3513
02:30:25,880 --> 02:30:28,130
But if you watch that outside the lines 
piece on her,

3514
02:30:28,131 --> 02:30:29,090
uh,
with the weight cutting,

3515
02:30:29,091 --> 02:30:31,220
have you ever seen it?
I've seen it in and it's horrific.

3516
02:30:31,230 --> 02:30:32,063
Commissioner was like,
I would never approve her to fight like 

3517
02:30:33,891 --> 02:30:34,130
sheet.

3518
02:30:34,130 --> 02:30:36,620
That's terrific.
How she's fighting at one three,

3519
02:30:36,621 --> 02:30:37,730
five should be illegal.
Well,

3520
02:30:37,731 --> 02:30:41,230
one 40 she never got 20 to 35 40 even 
when 40 you got to watch it,

3521
02:30:41,231 --> 02:30:41,711
Eddie.
It's,

3522
02:30:41,711 --> 02:30:43,010
it's insane.
Terrifying.

3523
02:30:43,040 --> 02:30:43,873
It's insane.
She's the way she should be able to do 

3524
02:30:45,111 --> 02:30:45,944
that around the fight and that's why 
she's saying she turned down those two 

3525
02:30:48,261 --> 02:30:49,880
title fights because I was given a shit.
I'm like,

3526
02:30:49,881 --> 02:30:52,740
who turns down title fights?
Even though they made the division for,

3527
02:30:52,940 --> 02:30:54,920
she's saying,
I destroyed my body.

3528
02:30:55,450 --> 02:30:58,010
I'm having depression.
I'm having a horrible issues.

3529
02:30:58,070 --> 02:31:00,620
My Body's just not ready to fight like I
need to march.

3530
02:31:01,370 --> 02:31:02,630
Well,
when you talk to people,

3531
02:31:02,780 --> 02:31:03,613
we talked to people that have caught 
like ridiculous amounts of weight like 

3532
02:31:05,451 --> 02:31:06,284
that,
and then all of a sudden the body just 

3533
02:31:06,831 --> 02:31:07,664
goes,
which just if something goes wrong and 

3534
02:31:09,830 --> 02:31:11,570
your body doesn't want to lose any 
weight anymore,

3535
02:31:11,571 --> 02:31:13,700
your kidneys start aching.
You get kidney stones.

3536
02:31:13,850 --> 02:31:18,110
It could be some serious side effects.
Cutting back highway two goats.

3537
02:31:18,111 --> 02:31:19,320
Shit,
man,

3538
02:31:19,380 --> 02:31:20,310
it's so dangerous.

3539
02:31:20,310 --> 02:31:21,143
You're,
you're literally getting to the door of 

3540
02:31:22,831 --> 02:31:25,380
death 24 hours before you enter into a 
cage fight.

3541
02:31:25,410 --> 02:31:29,550
It's the craziest thing that we allow 
people to do an MMA and it's essentially

3542
02:31:29,551 --> 02:31:31,560
in a lot of ways it's sanctioned,
cheating,

3543
02:31:32,190 --> 02:31:33,640
true sanction,
cheating.

3544
02:31:33,650 --> 02:31:34,483
He's trying to get out of them classes 
and then you've got to have a way to 

3545
02:31:36,091 --> 02:31:37,380
enforce them.
What's,

3546
02:31:37,381 --> 02:31:38,760
what's your,
what's your idea?

3547
02:31:39,750 --> 02:31:44,750
I think there's gotta be a way to get 
guys to fight people that are their size

3548
02:31:45,060 --> 02:31:49,440
without having the same rigid wait 
structure where you have like one 55 and

3549
02:31:49,441 --> 02:31:53,160
one 70 and one 85 any solutions?
No,

3550
02:31:53,280 --> 02:31:54,113
I don't.
I think there's gotta be a way to check 

3551
02:31:55,921 --> 02:31:56,754
hydration levels and camp and there's 
gotta be a way you're going to have to 

3552
02:31:59,611 --> 02:32:02,490
blow the whole thing up though.
Like champions won't be the champions in

3553
02:32:02,491 --> 02:32:03,660
the same way class anymore.

3554
02:32:03,900 --> 02:32:07,110
But if you've got Chris Weidman to fight
at his natural weight and another guy to

3555
02:32:07,111 --> 02:32:09,000
fight at his you and how you determine 
that,

3556
02:32:09,180 --> 02:32:12,630
you would have to find out what a guy 
ways when he's in shape and fit.

3557
02:32:12,631 --> 02:32:15,250
And you would have to do this whole 
transition over a period of time.

3558
02:32:15,310 --> 02:32:16,500
When that went along,
comes in,

3559
02:32:16,530 --> 02:32:18,360
that's when they're going to cut.
No,

3560
02:32:18,390 --> 02:32:20,180
you don't allow,
you don't allow him to,

3561
02:32:20,230 --> 02:32:23,340
there would also be like 20 belts.
I'm in good shape.

3562
02:32:23,360 --> 02:32:26,070
But you do the same thing that you do 
with Usada.

3563
02:32:26,100 --> 02:32:28,110
You'd randomly test their hydration 
levels.

3564
02:32:28,111 --> 02:32:28,944
You randomly test their weight.
So if they're healthy and they're in 

3565
02:32:30,181 --> 02:32:31,014
camp,
there's no way they're gonna keep that 

3566
02:32:31,411 --> 02:32:33,090
weight off the entire camp.
It's impossible,

3567
02:32:33,120 --> 02:32:36,540
but you can't.
As long as it's close.

3568
02:32:36,541 --> 02:32:39,690
It's like when cowboy cuts five pounds,
that's normal.

3569
02:32:39,720 --> 02:32:41,220
Like when you see cowboy,
you don't go,

3570
02:32:41,340 --> 02:32:41,700
you don't go.

3571
02:32:41,700 --> 02:32:43,650
There's no way.
This dude is one 70 you look at him,

3572
02:32:43,651 --> 02:32:44,071
you go,
yeah,

3573
02:32:44,071 --> 02:32:46,260
he looks like he's one seven.
That's his real weight.

3574
02:32:46,500 --> 02:32:48,090
When you look at Damien Maia,
you like,

3575
02:32:48,091 --> 02:32:50,910
there's no fucking way he's won 70 he's 
200 pounds.

3576
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:53,910
When you look at like rick story,
he's giant that like there's,

3577
02:32:53,911 --> 02:32:56,910
there's some guys that cut the weight 
and then put it back on in a big way.

3578
02:32:57,030 --> 02:32:57,863
Johnny Hendricks in his prime.
Johnny Hendricks says prime would be 

3579
02:33:00,301 --> 02:33:01,134
Jack modified when he was Merkin,
John Fitch and Marvin Capelin and those 

3580
02:33:04,651 --> 02:33:07,890
guys.
So random wayins random.

3581
02:33:07,891 --> 02:33:10,290
So for sure they're not going to be 
cutting the exactly what?

3582
02:33:10,291 --> 02:33:11,730
No,
they couldn't.

3583
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:17,000
And then whatever you weigh in at they,
they let you cut five pounds of you need

3584
02:33:17,100 --> 02:33:18,680
to or something like that.
Something along those lines.

3585
02:33:18,700 --> 02:33:20,580
You give a person like a five pound 
buffer.

3586
02:33:20,620 --> 02:33:21,900
Yeah,
it's super messy.

3587
02:33:21,900 --> 02:33:23,130
But yeah,
it does get messy.

3588
02:33:23,310 --> 02:33:24,800
But you also,
I think you,

3589
02:33:24,801 --> 02:33:25,634
you,
you causing part of the problem with 

3590
02:33:26,590 --> 02:33:29,970
Wayans by having these very specific 
weight classes,

3591
02:33:29,971 --> 02:33:30,804
like one 55 one 70 so then the problem 
would be determining who is a champion 

3592
02:33:34,350 --> 02:33:38,550
and what do you call that champion?
You have a Builtin area because you know

3593
02:33:38,551 --> 02:33:39,384
you,
you'd say welterweight or middleweight 

3594
02:33:40,441 --> 02:33:41,274
or light heavyweight.
Well you're not saying is the 155 pound 

3595
02:33:44,371 --> 02:33:45,810
champ.
The names are kind of silly.

3596
02:33:45,900 --> 02:33:50,900
Like why is welterweight one 70 and MMA 
but one 47 and boxing heavyweight boxing

3597
02:33:52,801 --> 02:33:53,634
has been around forever.
Why do we have different names or 

3598
02:33:55,921 --> 02:33:58,080
different weight classes for the same 
sport?

3599
02:33:58,380 --> 02:33:59,213
But it doesn't matter.
It's still everybody knows what a 

3600
02:34:00,300 --> 02:34:02,010
lightheaded off that.
Yeah,

3601
02:34:02,011 --> 02:34:02,844
it's still crazy.
My point is instead have like 

3602
02:34:06,360 --> 02:34:10,950
lightweight middleweight have all these 
different names but have people actually

3603
02:34:10,951 --> 02:34:15,540
way that like for a guy who's won 70 
have an actual hundred 70 pound man,

3604
02:34:15,790 --> 02:34:18,430
that's some crazy dude who gets to two 
15

3605
02:34:18,430 --> 02:34:21,040
like like rumble Johnson is just too,
how about this?

3606
02:34:21,070 --> 02:34:23,140
How about that?
That would work,

3607
02:34:23,141 --> 02:34:25,030
but how hard would it be in the,
you know,

3608
02:34:25,031 --> 02:34:27,940
the random testing and all that shit and
then the five pounds,

3609
02:34:27,941 --> 02:34:29,020
one of the guys,
six pounds.

3610
02:34:29,530 --> 02:34:34,530
What you could do is that the two,
the 48 hours before the weigh in,

3611
02:34:35,680 --> 02:34:37,210
you're under control.
You have,

3612
02:34:37,240 --> 02:34:39,790
you have to have like you're in a hotel.
Oh really?

3613
02:34:40,390 --> 02:34:42,640
You can't do any extreme weight cutting?
No.

3614
02:34:42,880 --> 02:34:46,900
Weird back check in on Tuesday.
I don't again,

3615
02:34:46,901 --> 02:34:49,000
Burt's gone to the commission on,
on what the fuck to do now,

3616
02:34:49,001 --> 02:34:53,440
but they used to do as soon as you land,
you don't check anything.

3617
02:34:53,441 --> 02:34:57,730
You go to the room and they weigh you 
and if you're like 40 pounds,

3618
02:34:57,731 --> 02:35:00,370
40 pounds over there,
you know they're on your man.

3619
02:35:00,970 --> 02:35:01,870
Yeah.
It makes sense.

3620
02:35:02,260 --> 02:35:04,120
Yeah,
that's it makes sense.

3621
02:35:04,150 --> 02:35:04,721
That's it.
Yeah.

3622
02:35:04,721 --> 02:35:08,230
You'd have to do enough to where you all
the time and when they're all,

3623
02:35:08,510 --> 02:35:09,343
yeah,
they're all over it and you're weighing 

3624
02:35:09,731 --> 02:35:13,240
in every day.
If you're red flag,

3625
02:35:13,241 --> 02:35:15,340
then they'll tell Dana,
hey,

3626
02:35:16,220 --> 02:35:18,180
bad,
good example guys.

3627
02:35:18,610 --> 02:35:19,443
But they don't,
they don't because the guy still miss 

3628
02:35:21,011 --> 02:35:21,844
cause like,
Hey Kelvin's 30 pounds over weight and 

3629
02:35:24,251 --> 02:35:24,791
like,
all right,

3630
02:35:24,791 --> 02:35:26,710
well he's made it before.
Yeah.

3631
02:35:26,720 --> 02:35:27,553
You can't still can't have that,
which you got to have is someone who 

3632
02:35:30,310 --> 02:35:31,143
doesn't allow anybody to fight 30 pounds
over what they actually weigh in that 

3633
02:35:34,800 --> 02:35:35,633
it's not legal like Weidman cut,
I want to say 37 pounds and three day 

3634
02:35:39,851 --> 02:35:40,684
Yoda.
Yeah.

3635
02:35:40,870 --> 02:35:41,703
When he fought Leo Machida,
there's gotta be an official way in a 

3636
02:35:46,090 --> 02:35:47,400
few times.
Yeah.

3637
02:35:47,410 --> 02:35:49,180
Like they all got to throw your shit out
camp.

3638
02:35:49,920 --> 02:35:50,753
They do that in Abu Dhabi because it's a
two day tournament and you got to wait 

3639
02:35:53,281 --> 02:35:54,114
if you make it to the Sunday,
if you went a couple of matches and you 

3640
02:35:57,041 --> 02:35:59,980
get it to the semifinals and finals,
you got to weigh in again.

3641
02:36:00,100 --> 02:36:02,920
Who did send fight when he cut all that 
way it was it Damien Maia?

3642
02:36:03,040 --> 02:36:04,010
No,
it wasn't a,

3643
02:36:04,100 --> 02:36:06,430
it was in Abu Dhabi and he's cutting 
weight on the plane.

3644
02:36:06,431 --> 02:36:08,850
Remind hose and I would dobby so he did.
Was it,

3645
02:36:08,920 --> 02:36:11,560
who did he fight?
He fight [inaudible] no,

3646
02:36:11,561 --> 02:36:13,480
it wasn't.
No,

3647
02:36:13,481 --> 02:36:15,340
it wasn't [inaudible] it was in Abu 
Dhabi.

3648
02:36:15,341 --> 02:36:16,174
I remember I thought he,
he was Damien Maia Boyz days and that 

3649
02:36:21,211 --> 02:36:25,360
was on Fox wasn't it?
I find it uh,

3650
02:36:25,620 --> 02:36:26,453
two immunos on that card.
So was that Abu Dhabi when Bj Penn 

3651
02:36:29,951 --> 02:36:30,784
fought Frankie Edgar?
It must've been cause the other Aboud 

3652
02:36:32,560 --> 02:36:34,690
Dobby card was when Anderson fought 
Damien Maia.

3653
02:36:35,350 --> 02:36:37,330
Right.
Those are the two that I went to.

3654
02:36:37,510 --> 02:36:39,100
I don't think if the Fox card,
no,

3655
02:36:39,780 --> 02:36:40,990
you might.
I think you're right.

3656
02:36:41,050 --> 02:36:43,630
What do you think about the new rules 
that a big John McCarthy?

3657
02:36:43,631 --> 02:36:44,690
Do you see that video?
No,

3658
02:36:44,930 --> 02:36:45,763
no,
no.

3659
02:36:46,260 --> 02:36:47,590
You replay.
I didn't watch it.

3660
02:36:47,650 --> 02:36:48,483
He didn't watch your MMA encyclopedia.
How could you not watch the new unified 

3661
02:36:53,321 --> 02:36:55,840
rules?
The Big John McCarthy posted,

3662
02:36:55,841 --> 02:36:56,531
you watched it,
right?

3663
02:36:56,531 --> 02:36:57,364
Yeah,
it was Damien Maia basically bought a 

3664
02:36:58,871 --> 02:37:01,690
stand up fight against Damien Maia and 
it was on Fox.

3665
02:37:02,170 --> 02:37:03,003
It was the second card on Fox and he cut
short amount of weight in a law or a 

3666
02:37:06,950 --> 02:37:07,783
law.
A lot of weight in a short amount of 22 

3667
02:37:09,221 --> 02:37:10,900
pounds in 10 days.
Insane.

3668
02:37:10,990 --> 02:37:13,420
Insane.
Like she too shy like you do.

3669
02:37:13,430 --> 02:37:15,770
You get to death's door and then he's so
it tough.

3670
02:37:15,850 --> 02:37:16,683
Yeah.
You can't do that.

3671
02:37:16,880 --> 02:37:17,713
I still want,
you know when fighters are against the 

3672
02:37:18,801 --> 02:37:21,170
cage and they put their hand on the mat 
so they don't get kneed in the face.

3673
02:37:21,320 --> 02:37:22,510
Can't do that no more.
That's all.

3674
02:37:22,540 --> 02:37:24,850
You gotta have all four,
uh,

3675
02:37:24,890 --> 02:37:27,310
you have have both hands?
No,

3676
02:37:27,500 --> 02:37:30,110
they haven't had that starfish in 2017.

3677
02:37:32,830 --> 02:37:34,810
Yeah,
it's a great rule.

3678
02:37:35,180 --> 02:37:36,530
Hell yeah.
It's a little,

3679
02:37:36,531 --> 02:37:37,400
I mean,
did they,

3680
02:37:37,401 --> 02:37:39,350
did they talk about I or anything like 
that?

3681
02:37:40,520 --> 02:37:41,353
I don't think so.
They did talk about a clavicle grabs 

3682
02:37:44,670 --> 02:37:46,700
grabbing the collar.
That used to be illegal.

3683
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:47,833
You could do that.
I remember hearing the guy say that he 

3684
02:37:49,131 --> 02:37:49,671
could do that.
Oh,

3685
02:37:49,671 --> 02:37:52,370
just so many in the collarbone.
Please do try that.

3686
02:37:52,400 --> 02:37:54,430
Please do.
Please try to like,

3687
02:37:54,620 --> 02:37:56,840
I just kicked him in the knee.
The column on those,

3688
02:37:56,841 --> 02:37:59,780
the dumbest like you really think it's 
that easy.

3689
02:38:00,010 --> 02:38:00,843
Yeah.
Just going to get someone on their 

3690
02:38:01,671 --> 02:38:03,110
collar bone,
I think collapses,

3691
02:38:04,610 --> 02:38:05,443
right?
Yeah.

3692
02:38:05,620 --> 02:38:06,453
Dudes,
they think they could just kick you in 

3693
02:38:08,691 --> 02:38:10,460
the knee and then they're going to have 
like a mobile icu.

3694
02:38:10,640 --> 02:38:13,790
To your way point.
A guy who could really benefit from that

3695
02:38:13,791 --> 02:38:15,800
as Chris Weidman,
he met light heavyweight.

3696
02:38:15,830 --> 02:38:17,450
He should be a light heavyweight,
I feel like.

3697
02:38:17,630 --> 02:38:18,231
Yeah,
for sure.

3698
02:38:18,231 --> 02:38:19,064
Well,
Jon Jones should be a heavyweight then 

3699
02:38:19,950 --> 02:38:20,783
you know,
John Jones fought Dan Henderson that 

3700
02:38:22,340 --> 02:38:24,340
grappling match.
He was 238 pounds.

3701
02:38:24,500 --> 02:38:26,630
I mean he murked cheeses,
so wheezes.

3702
02:38:26,750 --> 02:38:28,560
What a beautiful takedown.
She's takedown.

3703
02:38:28,600 --> 02:38:29,690
Yup.
Oh my God,

3704
02:38:29,691 --> 02:38:31,860
I love it.
He shot in and Gary,

3705
02:38:31,870 --> 02:38:35,270
Tony and hit that very same takedown but
unsuccessfully on his opponent.

3706
02:38:35,300 --> 02:38:36,133
Kim.
Yeah.

3707
02:38:36,260 --> 02:38:37,093
And grappling match right after that I 
think is going to go to light 

3708
02:38:40,221 --> 02:38:41,054
heavyweight.
John is so big for light heavyweight 

3709
02:38:42,621 --> 02:38:44,690
man.
He's so fucking physically talented too.

3710
02:38:44,840 --> 02:38:45,451
What is it?
It's a,

3711
02:38:45,451 --> 02:38:50,450
it's a fake single and then you kind of 
like duck under the clinch.

3712
02:38:50,480 --> 02:38:51,680
Yup.
Is that what that was?

3713
02:38:51,681 --> 02:38:54,650
And the way John did it was just,
it was so glorious.

3714
02:38:54,651 --> 02:38:58,640
We watch how quickly he covered ground.
You realize like how fucking talented he

3715
02:38:58,641 --> 02:38:59,474
is.
I don't even think it's up on the 

3716
02:39:00,621 --> 02:39:01,250
Internet either.

3717
02:39:01,250 --> 02:39:02,840
I think it is.
You can watch it and go watch.

3718
02:39:04,100 --> 02:39:04,933
You could watch the uh,
the take down and you can watch the 

3719
02:39:06,291 --> 02:39:07,124
finish.
I don't think you watched the whole 

3720
02:39:07,521 --> 02:39:08,354
fight and now are they going to do John 
Verse jail now because John got on the 

3721
02:39:11,901 --> 02:39:12,411
mic.
I was like,

3722
02:39:12,411 --> 02:39:13,950
yeah,
I want to fight you chill.

3723
02:39:13,951 --> 02:39:14,784
And I think they are going to probably 
do something like a tail will go in 

3724
02:39:17,481 --> 02:39:22,400
there and get smooshed for the hx.
John is just too big and too good.

3725
02:39:22,610 --> 02:39:23,990
He's so talented,
man.

3726
02:39:24,080 --> 02:39:26,360
He's winning Jujitsu tournaments like as
a goof.

3727
02:39:26,570 --> 02:39:29,700
He stepping into them and and grapple 
with people and strangling.

3728
02:39:30,410 --> 02:39:33,080
Go with like a gary tone tonin with 
they'll re,

3729
02:39:35,230 --> 02:39:38,870
yeah.
Let me tell you something man.

3730
02:39:39,050 --> 02:39:40,910
What John said when he was on my podcast
goes,

3731
02:39:40,911 --> 02:39:43,100
I fell in love with Jujitsu because I'm 
obsessed with it.

3732
02:39:43,130 --> 02:39:44,360
He goes,
I'm training all the time.

3733
02:39:44,361 --> 02:39:44,781
He goes,
no,

3734
02:39:44,781 --> 02:39:46,640
I'm not going to be standing in front of
people trade anymore.

3735
02:39:46,880 --> 02:39:47,870
He goes,
fuck that.

3736
02:39:47,990 --> 02:39:49,400
He's like,
I wouldn't be taking people down,

3737
02:39:49,430 --> 02:39:50,800
choking the shit out of him.
He said,

3738
02:39:50,940 --> 02:39:51,530
yeah,
yeah,

3739
02:39:51,530 --> 02:39:52,560
yeah.
It was hilarious.

3740
02:39:52,561 --> 02:39:55,520
It was like just he,
he's so talented as a grappler,

3741
02:39:55,590 --> 02:39:57,590
you can do whatever you like.
It's on some other planet.

3742
02:39:58,400 --> 02:40:00,950
It was a nice pass to,
he took them down and then it was a nice

3743
02:40:00,951 --> 02:40:01,784
pass.
That arm triangle was John Jones might 

3744
02:40:03,321 --> 02:40:05,190
be pulling guard on people,
an arm bar.

3745
02:40:05,730 --> 02:40:06,563
He Guardian Daniel,
come on Daniel after he was beaten him 

3746
02:40:10,170 --> 02:40:11,240
up,
but he,

3747
02:40:11,260 --> 02:40:13,800
he might be pulling guard on people,
an arm bar on him in the future.

3748
02:40:13,830 --> 02:40:16,950
He's also a guy who,
who could do and even to a bay level,

3749
02:40:16,951 --> 02:40:19,200
beat the light heavyweight champion 
heavyweight champ.

3750
02:40:20,040 --> 02:40:20,873
And he could do that.
You can get so much more notoriety than 

3751
02:40:22,711 --> 02:40:26,400
connor could it like dobby absolute as 
well.

3752
02:40:26,590 --> 02:40:28,700
Maybe he might do we look Humana?
There's,

3753
02:40:28,800 --> 02:40:32,190
you occasionally get a guy that's just 
so incredibly talented.

3754
02:40:32,191 --> 02:40:32,790
You Go,
well,

3755
02:40:32,790 --> 02:40:35,150
it's really all about focus.
It's about foot.

3756
02:40:35,160 --> 02:40:36,930
Like if you watch him,
watch him,

3757
02:40:36,931 --> 02:40:39,120
you've seen it.
The Dan Henderson match.

3758
02:40:39,240 --> 02:40:41,430
But Dan Henderson's totally undersize is
not,

3759
02:40:41,431 --> 02:40:42,840
they're not nearly in the same way 
class,

3760
02:40:43,140 --> 02:40:44,890
but it's really not going all out.
He was busy,

3761
02:40:45,080 --> 02:40:46,960
but it's effortless.
I mean,

3762
02:40:46,961 --> 02:40:48,000
you,
you watch how he does,

3763
02:40:48,001 --> 02:40:49,680
he like,
what do you mean Dan Henderson was going

3764
02:40:49,681 --> 02:40:53,630
light?
I just think Dan was nice match.

3765
02:40:53,650 --> 02:40:56,940
It was competition.
Watch this here.

3766
02:40:57,090 --> 02:41:00,210
Here it goes.
Because this is a suspended UFC fighter.

3767
02:41:00,211 --> 02:41:01,470
Jon Jones,
what does it say?

3768
02:41:01,471 --> 02:41:04,530
Fought Dan Henderson at underground 
event and uh,

3769
02:41:04,560 --> 02:41:05,393
John started off on his knees and just 
crawled forward and he see Dan like 

3770
02:41:09,151 --> 02:41:14,151
putting his hand on his head and John 
[inaudible] John is like,

3771
02:41:16,440 --> 02:41:17,490
he's like unstoppable.

3772
02:41:17,490 --> 02:41:21,890
The waste closing in on so strong.
He's,

3773
02:41:22,260 --> 02:41:24,060
what I'm saying is like the ways moving 
in on them,

3774
02:41:24,061 --> 02:41:27,870
it's almost like unavoidable.
It's like this is going to be a mauling,

3775
02:41:28,370 --> 02:41:29,203
you know this is not going to be like 
what he did with jail sign and when he 

3776
02:41:31,261 --> 02:41:33,900
grabbed shale and took them down and 
just slammed on the ground.

3777
02:41:33,930 --> 02:41:34,763
So their size and compete with John.
Like look at the guys that have given 

3778
02:41:37,141 --> 02:41:40,200
him issues like Gustafson,
he says same size.

3779
02:41:40,201 --> 02:41:41,870
Those are the only time he really has 
issued.

3780
02:41:41,871 --> 02:41:42,704
He toward gave him some issues.
[inaudible] hard bar I think got dealt 

3781
02:41:45,451 --> 02:41:46,950
with.
He submitted veto us.

3782
02:41:46,951 --> 02:41:47,940
He did.
Yes he did.

3783
02:41:48,060 --> 02:41:49,380
But when Vito caught him in that arm 
bar,

3784
02:41:49,381 --> 02:41:50,214
that was like really the first time we'd
seen him ever in trouble inside the ox 

3785
02:41:52,851 --> 02:41:53,940
human they think,
yeah,

3786
02:41:54,190 --> 02:41:58,290
I'll get out of here.
This is mostly John just pushing them up

3787
02:41:58,291 --> 02:41:59,460
against the cage and they let him go.
Oh,

3788
02:41:59,461 --> 02:42:01,460
he threw a jab at him.
What the fuck is that about?

3789
02:42:04,750 --> 02:42:05,583
We didn't really throw a jab like he 
pretended he was going to do a spinning 

3790
02:42:07,481 --> 02:42:08,560
elbow.
Oh,

3791
02:42:08,561 --> 02:42:09,394
he's just clowning around.
I think rockhold wants to do it to Jon 

3792
02:42:11,500 --> 02:42:12,670
Jones was rockhold.
That's right.

3793
02:42:13,120 --> 02:42:14,950
Rockhold did say that.
Let's see the tape.

3794
02:42:14,980 --> 02:42:16,420
Well how long did the match go?

3795
02:42:18,150 --> 02:42:18,983
I don't remember,
but it did take down was the ridiculous 

3796
02:42:21,271 --> 02:42:22,104
thing.
I'll see if you could find that in 

3797
02:42:22,681 --> 02:42:25,320
there.
See now this is worth it,

3798
02:42:25,321 --> 02:42:26,430
Eddie,
just to make money

3799
02:42:27,640 --> 02:42:30,250
cause you're not no head trauma if you 
lose it's whatever.

3800
02:42:30,430 --> 02:42:31,330
Oh yeah,
for sure.

3801
02:42:31,331 --> 02:42:34,030
This is a totally different thing.
I really wished that this pay,

3802
02:42:34,040 --> 02:42:36,460
there it is.
Woo Boom,

3803
02:42:36,790 --> 02:42:37,623
gets him down and riding side control.
I really wished that this was a viable 

3804
02:42:41,861 --> 02:42:45,070
option in terms of like financial 
success.

3805
02:42:45,071 --> 02:42:47,920
I really wished that there was a a way,
I think,

3806
02:42:47,921 --> 02:42:50,110
I think your event has the best chance 
of doing it.

3807
02:42:50,200 --> 02:42:52,110
I really do.
I think if your event,

3808
02:42:52,120 --> 02:42:52,953
when people watch it and get behind it 
has a real possibility because it's 

3809
02:42:56,351 --> 02:42:59,350
fucking exciting as shit and people will
pay money to see it.

3810
02:42:59,410 --> 02:43:00,243
Especially when line at Vegas.
Caliber of these guys are doing and 

3811
02:43:02,051 --> 02:43:05,230
flying to Vegas tomorrow,
meeting with a UFC fight pass.

3812
02:43:05,231 --> 02:43:07,090
They want to,
they got great numbers.

3813
02:43:07,091 --> 02:43:07,924
Ebi 10 they said the numbers were 
staggering and they want us to get 

3814
02:43:10,601 --> 02:43:12,120
behind and go crazy.
It's the

3815
02:43:12,130 --> 02:43:14,530
best thing about Eddie.
Look at this.

3816
02:43:14,531 --> 02:43:17,530
This is totally possible.
You could be the Don King of chokes.

3817
02:43:18,360 --> 02:43:20,860
Oh look at this.
Let me get this top fucking jokes.

3818
02:43:20,861 --> 02:43:22,900
Look at this.
Just you and Eddie.

3819
02:43:22,901 --> 02:43:23,734
You were saying that you are,
oftentimes we'll stay in the mountain 

3820
02:43:26,030 --> 02:43:28,200
that you don't three quarter mount 
butter amount.

3821
02:43:28,750 --> 02:43:30,280
You stayed.
Do you ever say in full amount?

3822
02:43:30,640 --> 02:43:34,960
Full amount to only because the rise of 
leg lockers,

3823
02:43:34,961 --> 02:43:35,920
deadly leg,
leg,

3824
02:43:35,950 --> 02:43:39,250
leg lockers that hit a leg lock 
transition when they're mounted,

3825
02:43:39,400 --> 02:43:42,520
so if you let them get their hips up.
I always stay in three core.

3826
02:43:42,521 --> 02:43:44,800
I don't even,
the only time I'm doing a full amount is

3827
02:43:44,801 --> 02:43:45,634
if I'm in sky dive,
if I got my hips down and my ankles 

3828
02:43:47,741 --> 02:43:49,810
crossed and then I'm hunting for an 
under hook,

3829
02:43:50,050 --> 02:43:50,883
but I'll never just sit there and 
regular amount because everybody now 

3830
02:43:53,741 --> 02:43:54,574
has,
has got that mount escape to leg locks 

3831
02:43:56,201 --> 02:43:56,840
that you got.

3832
02:43:56,840 --> 02:43:58,610
It could just turn everything around.
It could be over.

3833
02:43:58,810 --> 02:44:00,230
So Sean,
the hips and get soaked.

3834
02:44:00,310 --> 02:44:01,143
Also those ridiculously flexible guys 
that get those legs and play like 

3835
02:44:03,731 --> 02:44:06,370
Eddie's dexterity,
your dexterity.

3836
02:44:06,820 --> 02:44:10,100
It's always been my main escape too is 
using my flexibility when someone mounts

3837
02:44:10,101 --> 02:44:10,630
it.
Right.

3838
02:44:10,630 --> 02:44:15,190
And that takes me into leg locks and at 
that used to be the only he'll hook.

3839
02:44:15,191 --> 02:44:19,930
I had in my game was off being mounted 
and then I would use a hail Mary escape,

3840
02:44:20,050 --> 02:44:22,810
see cups in the armpits,
cross my feet in front of her stomach,

3841
02:44:22,990 --> 02:44:26,290
over hook a leg and then take them right
to just good old fashion outside.

3842
02:44:26,291 --> 02:44:27,940
He'll hook that.
Uh,

3843
02:44:28,270 --> 02:44:30,900
that was my number one escape and that's
just too dangerous now,

3844
02:44:30,910 --> 02:44:31,743
not now.
Guys have taken that escape and added a 

3845
02:44:34,780 --> 02:44:39,010
thousand more leg lock transitions off 
it and at that I actually had a guy come

3846
02:44:39,011 --> 02:44:39,844
to my gym maybe four or five years ago 
for a purple belt from Hen Zos and he 

3847
02:44:44,381 --> 02:44:48,010
was super flex by walk onto the Mat and 
he sitting there walking to class,

3848
02:44:48,011 --> 02:44:50,080
he's got both legs behind his head.

3849
02:44:50,170 --> 02:44:51,520
I don't know who this guy is.
He said,

3850
02:44:52,360 --> 02:44:52,841
he said,
Oh,

3851
02:44:52,841 --> 02:44:53,674
I'm at,
so I'm like,

3852
02:44:53,800 --> 02:44:55,300
how you doing?
He's just like looking at me.

3853
02:44:55,301 --> 02:44:56,860
He just wanted,
he wanted to show me how flexible,

3854
02:44:56,861 --> 02:44:58,850
it was way more flexible than I am,
way more.

3855
02:44:59,690 --> 02:45:00,523
I can't cross my feet behind my head and
we rolled and I mounted him quite 

3856
02:45:04,421 --> 02:45:05,860
easily,
but I didn't know it was a trick.

3857
02:45:05,980 --> 02:45:09,010
He let me mount them and then its 
flexibility and I was low,

3858
02:45:09,011 --> 02:45:09,844
I was super low,
but he would grab his feet and just put 

3859
02:45:12,491 --> 02:45:15,610
it in the little crack and inch by inch 
you with a stick his foot in B,

3860
02:45:15,611 --> 02:45:17,860
I'm laying flat on him and then he would
get through,

3861
02:45:17,861 --> 02:45:19,840
boom,
right into a leg lock and he tapped me.

3862
02:45:19,841 --> 02:45:20,830
I'm like,
Holy Shit.

3863
02:45:21,160 --> 02:45:23,020
So we went again and I mounted him 
again.

3864
02:45:23,021 --> 02:45:24,980
I said,
I shared amount of them.

3865
02:45:25,420 --> 02:45:26,253
You know,
there's some guys like you just don't 

3866
02:45:26,651 --> 02:45:28,240
fucking mouth these guys.
You take him to the truck.

3867
02:45:28,540 --> 02:45:29,373
So I mounted him and I was super tight,
just clinching time and he just grabbed 

3868
02:45:33,971 --> 02:45:36,640
his foot and just put it right there.
Just would hold it right in the,

3869
02:45:36,700 --> 02:45:40,600
in between our rib cages and he couldn't
get in initially,

3870
02:45:40,601 --> 02:45:43,570
but inch pan she would just get,
he would just pull this flynn,

3871
02:45:43,870 --> 02:45:46,720
it was like he was jail breaking,
uh,

3872
02:45:46,960 --> 02:45:47,793
uh,
uh,

3873
02:45:47,900 --> 02:45:49,600
to that mount escape.
Wow.

3874
02:45:49,900 --> 02:45:50,733
That's just crazy.
You got tapped me again and I thought 

3875
02:45:52,151 --> 02:45:53,440
from that point on I go,
hmm,

3876
02:45:53,860 --> 02:45:55,610
I can ever,
uh,

3877
02:45:55,690 --> 02:45:56,800
uh,
I can't,

3878
02:45:57,100 --> 02:45:57,933
I always got to make sure that I roll 
with people and assume everyone can do 

3879
02:46:04,811 --> 02:46:07,150
that,
doesn't and have that kind of ridiculous

3880
02:46:07,151 --> 02:46:08,760
flexibility,
dexterity.

3881
02:46:08,800 --> 02:46:10,160
You gotta assume everyone's that

3882
02:46:10,160 --> 02:46:11,540
good.
So at that point,

3883
02:46:11,541 --> 02:46:13,880
it altered my mouth a lot.
Like with the arm triangles,

3884
02:46:13,881 --> 02:46:14,714
I just stay in the mount.
So you just assume you have to assume 

3885
02:46:16,401 --> 02:46:19,040
that everybody's at the death level.
That why not?

3886
02:46:19,380 --> 02:46:21,100
Because if it works on them that it 
works on everybody.

3887
02:46:21,130 --> 02:46:21,963
To me up with it.
What was crazy when Eddie and I were 

3888
02:46:23,871 --> 02:46:24,704
doing that on an invitational thing,
they were telling us that there's like 

3889
02:46:27,260 --> 02:46:31,510
14 year olds mto tour homeschooled just 
to be dedicated to Jujitsu.

3890
02:46:32,990 --> 02:46:34,400
No,
those nine year old real,

3891
02:46:34,401 --> 02:46:35,990
those nine year olds.
I was like,

3892
02:46:35,991 --> 02:46:37,490
what the fuck is going on?
Yeah.

3893
02:46:37,620 --> 02:46:42,620
Two nine year olds doing ankle locks.
Fucking all your shit.

3894
02:46:42,680 --> 02:46:45,410
You know what we were talking before the
podcast started,

3895
02:46:45,411 --> 02:46:48,570
we were talking about physical freaks 
like that big gorilla Shane car.

3896
02:46:48,571 --> 02:46:50,060
When and how when,
uh,

3897
02:46:50,080 --> 02:46:51,770
I watched Jane Carlin role with people.

3898
02:46:51,770 --> 02:46:53,390
It's like,
what is the point of this?

3899
02:46:53,391 --> 02:46:56,450
This is preposterous.
Shankar Shankar.

3900
02:46:56,451 --> 02:46:57,284
We walked into a mall Easton's Jujitsu 
gym and I didn't know who he was for a 

3901
02:47:00,501 --> 02:47:01,490
second.
I'm obviously,

3902
02:47:01,491 --> 02:47:03,050
I knew who he was.
I'd commentated his fights,

3903
02:47:03,051 --> 02:47:03,884
but for a second I looked up from the 
mat and I saw him walk in and my tests 

3904
02:47:06,651 --> 02:47:07,484
on a person that's a gorilla.
That's some shaved shuttle out from the 

3905
02:47:10,190 --> 02:47:10,880
ECZEMA.
Yeah.

3906
02:47:10,880 --> 02:47:11,713
It doesn't even look like a real human 
and he would roll with people and it 

3907
02:47:13,491 --> 02:47:16,250
would be preposterous.
It's a waste of your time.

3908
02:47:16,251 --> 02:47:17,084
I remember I trained because Jane would 
have had another job and he'd have an 

3909
02:47:19,071 --> 02:47:21,290
injury.
So you'd gone for like four months,

3910
02:47:21,500 --> 02:47:23,560
not train Jujitsu twice a day.
So,

3911
02:47:23,570 --> 02:47:24,403
so I'm,
I can't wait cause he's like a big 

3912
02:47:25,101 --> 02:47:27,620
brother and I can't wait till I get to 
know more role this full up.

3913
02:47:28,100 --> 02:47:32,090
He would come in off his nine to five,
set his lunchbox down,

3914
02:47:32,660 --> 02:47:36,140
put on his fucking weird shit.
Basketball shorts,

3915
02:47:36,230 --> 02:47:37,220
baggy tee shirt.
I'm like,

3916
02:47:37,670 --> 02:47:38,481
you've been rolling.
I'm like,

3917
02:47:38,481 --> 02:47:39,314
yeah man,
let's go and you just fucking destroy 

3918
02:47:42,401 --> 02:47:43,250
me.
I'm like,

3919
02:47:43,251 --> 02:47:44,420
dude,
why don't you do more Jitsu?

3920
02:47:44,421 --> 02:47:48,200
Like why I can,
I'm just fucking gorilla.

3921
02:47:48,201 --> 02:47:49,034
Strongest as strong.
But wouldn't you love to see a guy like 

3922
02:47:51,021 --> 02:47:53,540
him fall in love with it?
And then when the Monday owls,

3923
02:47:54,020 --> 02:47:57,200
like how crazy would that be?
How crazy would it be to watch Shane car

3924
02:47:57,201 --> 02:47:58,034
when,
when Abu Dhabi with his wrestling 

3925
02:47:59,391 --> 02:48:00,570
background,
if he won,

3926
02:48:00,620 --> 02:48:03,890
if he dedicated,
dedicated himself to submissions,

3927
02:48:03,891 --> 02:48:07,190
like just pure submissions.
Like what a freak athlete is.

3928
02:48:07,200 --> 02:48:08,750
Months and choke,
you know,

3929
02:48:08,780 --> 02:48:11,210
cause he's bigger than months and he 
would pop your head off.

3930
02:48:11,240 --> 02:48:12,800
It took out it,
you know what the problem is though,

3931
02:48:12,801 --> 02:48:13,430
man.

3932
02:48:13,430 --> 02:48:17,540
He's got just that PR posture,
his punching power and he's like,

3933
02:48:17,541 --> 02:48:19,660
why would I not have my best thing?
Yeah.

3934
02:48:19,780 --> 02:48:21,740
Like his punching power was just 
ridiculous.

3935
02:48:21,741 --> 02:48:22,574
It's too much work.
Why don't I just jam that guy in the 

3936
02:48:24,171 --> 02:48:27,560
face and attending nef dog.
I mean it's gotta be,

3937
02:48:27,561 --> 02:48:28,394
it's gotta feel way better to knock 
someone out to drop someone than to tap 

3938
02:48:32,271 --> 02:48:35,750
him out.
Go into Shane Carwyn Kaos Frank Mir,

3939
02:48:35,930 --> 02:48:39,140
cause that was one of the darkest one 
frank mirs corner.

3940
02:48:39,320 --> 02:48:40,880
They're gone.
They're gone.

3941
02:48:40,970 --> 02:48:44,510
A chill frank rounds almost over.
Just chill and it pishing off.

3942
02:48:44,511 --> 02:48:49,010
He looks at the corner and it just 
fucking ends.

3943
02:48:49,011 --> 02:48:50,680
Frank made it right there.
That's what he does.

3944
02:48:50,840 --> 02:48:52,280
His is going,
you're good,

3945
02:48:52,281 --> 02:48:53,990
fine frank.
Just let him get the under hook.

3946
02:48:54,020 --> 02:48:56,480
Don't give him head control.
You're just chill.

3947
02:48:56,510 --> 02:48:57,341
It's almost the end.
The round.

3948
02:48:57,341 --> 02:48:58,400
Then shame.
It's like,

3949
02:48:58,430 --> 02:48:59,480
what are you talking about?

3950
02:48:59,480 --> 02:49:01,670
I can knock the dude up.
I need this much space.

3951
02:49:01,870 --> 02:49:03,260
Yeah.
Douche came over.

3952
02:49:03,350 --> 02:49:05,110
They were ridiculous.
Uppercuts,

3953
02:49:05,200 --> 02:49:06,033
just horrific dishes that he's,
he's an interesting example of mayor 

3954
02:49:09,661 --> 02:49:11,490
wants to do Ebi.
I know he does.

3955
02:49:11,491 --> 02:49:12,510
Yeah,
it's great idea.

3956
02:49:12,920 --> 02:49:14,100
He'd be like,
he's an awesome,

3957
02:49:14,190 --> 02:49:16,530
awesome as mission Fabi Silver Dome as 
well.

3958
02:49:16,650 --> 02:49:20,230
Wants to do combat Jujitsu,
the combat Jujitsu version of Eba,

3959
02:49:21,200 --> 02:49:22,033
which is going to be the next show.
Ebi Eleven's gonna have a regular 16 

3960
02:49:24,931 --> 02:49:26,160
man,
uh,

3961
02:49:26,190 --> 02:49:28,440
regular Ebi rules,
welter weights,

3962
02:49:28,980 --> 02:49:33,090
and within it a four man combat duty in 
March.

3963
02:49:33,300 --> 02:49:37,680
We nailed down the date tomorrow.
Let me know when it comes up.

3964
02:49:37,710 --> 02:49:40,740
There's going to be Jujitsu,
Jujitsu with pumps,

3965
02:49:40,741 --> 02:49:41,574
right.
Would come and I would go to it and 

3966
02:49:42,650 --> 02:49:44,870
catch it with you.
No,

3967
02:49:44,880 --> 02:49:45,713
no,
no.

3968
02:49:45,820 --> 02:49:46,653
Slap.
He moved,

3969
02:49:47,150 --> 02:49:49,180
but not slap the slap part.
But you know,

3970
02:49:49,200 --> 02:49:51,240
if you've ever thought about competing 
in Jiu Jitsu part,

3971
02:49:51,860 --> 02:49:54,630
uh,
he's been too busy with podcast.

3972
02:49:54,630 --> 02:49:56,630
I'm too busy with podcast shows and 
stuff.

3973
02:49:56,700 --> 02:49:57,533
Comedy,
you know,

3974
02:49:57,780 --> 02:50:01,460
family gun standups hard enough.
You know like it's so challenging man.

3975
02:50:01,461 --> 02:50:02,294
I appreciate that.
But you know when you did have that 

3976
02:50:03,811 --> 02:50:04,644
grappling match and metamorris a Cyborg 
and everybody got mad at you and you 

3977
02:50:06,931 --> 02:50:08,910
understand why everybody got mad at you 
[inaudible] percent,

3978
02:50:08,940 --> 02:50:11,850
you'd be even more mad if you know how 
much money I meant you did engage him.

3979
02:50:12,110 --> 02:50:14,010
He did engage him and engage him on the 
ground.

3980
02:50:14,011 --> 02:50:16,560
You gave Cyborg chances and he couldn't 
do shit with you.

3981
02:50:17,010 --> 02:50:17,940
And I watched it.
I was like,

3982
02:50:17,941 --> 02:50:18,774
wow,
like I understand you being cautious 

3983
02:50:20,101 --> 02:50:20,934
because you have to fight in the UFC and
you didn't want to get your legs torn 

3984
02:50:22,681 --> 02:50:23,520
up.
Cause cyborgs.

3985
02:50:23,850 --> 02:50:26,700
That tornado guard is and he's a 
ridiculously strong dude.

3986
02:50:26,730 --> 02:50:28,500
Ridiculous.
He's a bad motherfucker.

3987
02:50:28,530 --> 02:50:31,470
I mean Cyborg is a killer.
And but you did,

3988
02:50:31,500 --> 02:50:32,970
you did an all Phi as a tax.

3989
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:36,570
I mean I understand that you went pretty
straight defense but it did work.

3990
02:50:36,780 --> 02:50:37,700
You know,
it's interesting cause he,

3991
02:50:37,710 --> 02:50:38,543
he was engaging with you.
You work locked up with him in the 

3992
02:50:40,651 --> 02:50:42,090
garden.
He wasn't able to do anything with you.

3993
02:50:42,091 --> 02:50:42,924
I was like,
hmm,

3994
02:50:43,320 --> 02:50:44,153
I wonder how you would do if you like 
really dedicated yourself like an 

3995
02:50:48,420 --> 02:50:51,300
competed in some sort of an event.
Like you want the truth.

3996
02:50:51,301 --> 02:50:53,450
I just don't care.
That's all you need to say.

3997
02:50:53,530 --> 02:50:55,400
Too busy with other things like that.
That part,

3998
02:50:55,440 --> 02:50:56,273
that part of my life,
like I love watching this thing and I 

3999
02:50:57,631 --> 02:50:58,464
love commentating on it,
but to dead cause you really got to 

4000
02:51:00,571 --> 02:51:01,920
dedicate to keep it.
You know how it is.

4001
02:51:01,921 --> 02:51:03,510
You really got to dedicate and be all 
in.

4002
02:51:03,511 --> 02:51:04,344
Like all Cyborg is doing is shooting 
Jujitsu seminars and videos and rolling 

4003
02:51:08,570 --> 02:51:11,320
every day when you just don't care when 
you put metreon and asleep.

4004
02:51:11,370 --> 02:51:14,910
I remember thinking like,
who's got a fucking serious doris?

4005
02:51:15,300 --> 02:51:19,080
Like you have a serious Doris when you 
clamp that thing out on a mitre.

4006
02:51:19,090 --> 02:51:19,980
And I was like,
Ooh,

4007
02:51:20,100 --> 02:51:21,450
ow,
Ooh,

4008
02:51:21,480 --> 02:51:23,520
this is,
and then he was out and I was like,

4009
02:51:23,521 --> 02:51:25,790
that's a serious fucking darce choke.
Yeah.

4010
02:51:25,800 --> 02:51:26,611
That was my shit,
man.

4011
02:51:26,611 --> 02:51:27,780
I love,
I love Jujitsu,

4012
02:51:27,781 --> 02:51:29,280
but it's just,
yeah,

4013
02:51:29,281 --> 02:51:30,680
it's not,
and I'm not in that lane anymore.

4014
02:51:31,140 --> 02:51:36,090
It's not like the,
there's not big money in submission only

4015
02:51:36,091 --> 02:51:38,510
or I should be fun.
Maybe you know,

4016
02:51:38,550 --> 02:51:40,560
for the winter,
the winter has pretty good money.

4017
02:51:40,650 --> 02:51:41,483
I mean Gary Turner is made thousands and
thousands of dollars and Eddie Cummings 

4018
02:51:44,191 --> 02:51:46,290
and the $100,000
this year.

4019
02:51:47,040 --> 02:51:49,170
They're making money if you win.
But um,

4020
02:51:49,200 --> 02:51:50,880
overall,
you know,

4021
02:51:51,240 --> 02:51:52,530
you,
um,

4022
02:51:52,560 --> 02:51:54,840
there's right now there's no money for 
it,

4023
02:51:54,841 --> 02:51:55,674
but still still the guys that are in it,
the guys at the top there training fool 

4024
02:52:01,100 --> 02:52:03,810
on the fucking all the time.
I feel like your event,

4025
02:52:03,811 --> 02:52:06,160
has it changed your,
your event has

4026
02:52:06,160 --> 02:52:06,581
the,
the,

4027
02:52:06,581 --> 02:52:08,350
the possibility to change that.
I really do.

4028
02:52:08,720 --> 02:52:10,410
You've got the event.
I really did it.

4029
02:52:10,450 --> 02:52:11,231
Hopefully,
you know,

4030
02:52:11,231 --> 02:52:14,750
Ebi 10 was pretty fucking Damn Chris.
So crazy to watch man.

4031
02:52:14,770 --> 02:52:18,130
And you got little girls competing,
which is amazing to watch girls that are

4032
02:52:18,131 --> 02:52:19,650
like,
how old are the youngest girls?

4033
02:52:19,720 --> 02:52:20,553
You there?
The UFC didn't want to have any of that 

4034
02:52:22,751 --> 02:52:24,850
anymore.
So really I'm no more minors,

4035
02:52:24,880 --> 02:52:27,070
no more,
no more.

4036
02:52:27,380 --> 02:52:29,490
Uh,
under age two,

4037
02:52:29,560 --> 02:52:31,270
man,
was that because of the girl that got,

4038
02:52:31,271 --> 02:52:33,420
he'll hooked in her leg,
possibly soul snaps.

4039
02:52:33,421 --> 02:52:36,700
Rob Her heel.
The snap.

4040
02:52:36,780 --> 02:52:38,560
Yeah,
I remember that.

4041
02:52:38,650 --> 02:52:40,270
Yeah.
She had her acl blowout.

4042
02:52:40,410 --> 02:52:45,100
I love children do Jujitsu.
F that's the cutest shit.

4043
02:52:45,490 --> 02:52:46,323
It's more to my glove.
It shows you where the sports APP 

4044
02:52:48,650 --> 02:52:49,510
conundrum.
Come on.

4045
02:52:49,920 --> 02:52:52,510
Grace got drunk.
She is really amazing.

4046
02:52:52,540 --> 02:52:53,351
Who's Oak?
What's her name?

4047
02:52:53,351 --> 02:52:54,700
Cora Hora sac.

4048
02:52:54,760 --> 02:52:56,920
Have you seen this Korean girl?
She had the big old check.

4049
02:52:56,950 --> 02:52:57,783
Why isn't it possible to maybe have a 
youth version of the same thing and to 

4050
02:53:01,930 --> 02:53:04,990
have like just call it something else 
and don't do it on bypass?

4051
02:53:05,440 --> 02:53:06,273
That is possible.
It seems like there might be an option 

4052
02:53:08,710 --> 02:53:09,820
to do other stuff as well.
I mean,

4053
02:53:09,821 --> 02:53:11,290
unless you have some sort of exclusive 
thing,

4054
02:53:11,291 --> 02:53:12,920
which I don't want to grow it.
I,

4055
02:53:12,940 --> 02:53:13,773
I really liked that pop one.
Or do you want to give kids the chance 

4056
02:53:16,181 --> 02:53:19,120
to compete?
He had people loved watching grace.

4057
02:53:19,240 --> 02:53:21,340
People loved it.
That was my favorite.

4058
02:53:22,120 --> 02:53:24,580
She got bigger roars than anybody.
Oh yeah man.

4059
02:53:24,581 --> 02:53:27,520
Tremendous roars.
People fucking love watching grace.

4060
02:53:27,820 --> 02:53:30,310
But you know,
there's other shows she just,

4061
02:53:30,520 --> 02:53:31,880
she's going to do,
um,

4062
02:53:32,290 --> 02:53:33,123
show the arc finishers,
which is a sub only show Ebi rules on 

4063
02:53:35,591 --> 02:53:36,424
the East Coast.
She's going to do that and she's got a 

4064
02:53:37,151 --> 02:53:37,570
big fight.

4065
02:53:37,570 --> 02:53:38,403
It's like a super fight coming up.
Cora just fought in the honored and the 

4066
02:53:40,301 --> 02:53:42,100
table.
So there's these other,

4067
02:53:42,270 --> 02:53:43,103
uh,
uh,

4068
02:53:43,120 --> 02:53:43,953
submission only tournaments out there 
using ebi rules when they have a 

4069
02:53:46,901 --> 02:53:48,160
platform.
And,

4070
02:53:48,161 --> 02:53:48,994
you know,
the UFC did,

4071
02:53:49,030 --> 02:53:50,530
I didn't even want to fight them on it,
you know,

4072
02:53:50,531 --> 02:53:51,670
they like,
okay,

4073
02:53:51,870 --> 02:53:52,960
no minors,
no minors,

4074
02:53:52,961 --> 02:53:53,980
no big deal,
you know,

4075
02:53:54,010 --> 02:53:55,060
uh,
uh,

4076
02:53:55,600 --> 02:53:56,433
eventually we'll,
we'll see the return of grace 

4077
02:53:58,240 --> 02:54:00,400
eventually,
eventually can imagine,

4078
02:54:00,750 --> 02:54:02,890
you know,
three or four years later and when she's

4079
02:54:02,891 --> 02:54:05,680
18 and we bring her back and that's 
going to be crazy.

4080
02:54:05,800 --> 02:54:07,830
It's going to be like the guns and roses
were union.

4081
02:54:08,610 --> 02:54:10,240
Yeah.
Jujitsu.

4082
02:54:10,570 --> 02:54:11,403
Interesting.
It's just interesting to see it because 

4083
02:54:12,731 --> 02:54:13,564
I think it's a,
it's the safer alternative for the 

4084
02:54:15,251 --> 02:54:16,600
athletes,
especially athletes.

4085
02:54:16,601 --> 02:54:19,300
They really just want to develop the Jiu
Jitsu skills.

4086
02:54:19,301 --> 02:54:21,700
You can get immersed in Jujitsu.
They don't want to have to,

4087
02:54:21,790 --> 02:54:25,270
in order to be a professional,
have to compete as an MMA fighter.

4088
02:54:25,290 --> 02:54:25,870
Yeah.
Well,

4089
02:54:25,870 --> 02:54:28,120
competition is so high at Uga in 
Jujitsu,

4090
02:54:28,130 --> 02:54:29,080
right?
Oh yeah.

4091
02:54:29,110 --> 02:54:31,960
And so far,
every Jujitsu event has failed.

4092
02:54:32,110 --> 02:54:33,430
They've all failed.
All of them.

4093
02:54:33,690 --> 02:54:34,810
Uh,
and Ebi,

4094
02:54:34,811 --> 02:54:35,830
you know,
we're not out of the woods.

4095
02:54:35,831 --> 02:54:36,664
There's no big giant pile of money.
No one's making money except for the 

4096
02:54:38,981 --> 02:54:39,840
winters.
You know,

4097
02:54:39,850 --> 02:54:41,980
we're just,
it's a passion project.

4098
02:54:41,981 --> 02:54:44,380
100%.
And who knows,

4099
02:54:44,381 --> 02:54:45,214
maybe we don't survive.
But apparently we got really good 

4100
02:54:47,921 --> 02:54:50,290
reviews at the UFC fight pass for Ebi 
10,

4101
02:54:50,350 --> 02:54:52,960
which you could still watch right now.
You watch the replay was amazing.

4102
02:54:53,280 --> 02:54:56,020
I watch and Geo Martinez and Eddie 
Cummings go out at that.

4103
02:54:56,021 --> 02:54:59,980
That was one of the most epic Jujitsu 
matches of all time.

4104
02:54:59,981 --> 02:55:01,990
If you guys don't survive,
everyone's fun,

4105
02:55:02,020 --> 02:55:03,710
everyone's fine.
We're going to try it.

4106
02:55:03,730 --> 02:55:03,980
You know,

4107
02:55:03,980 --> 02:55:04,980
we're going to do our best.
Yeah.

4108
02:55:05,010 --> 02:55:07,130
You Guy know you'd being humble and 
everything like that,

4109
02:55:07,131 --> 02:55:07,980
but,
and I don't,

4110
02:55:07,981 --> 02:55:08,960
I,
you just never know.

4111
02:55:08,961 --> 02:55:10,730
No,
no events have made it so far.

4112
02:55:10,760 --> 02:55:11,481
No,
that's the main,

4113
02:55:11,481 --> 02:55:13,340
any markers.
The rule sucked ass.

4114
02:55:13,490 --> 02:55:15,830
Go back to the card.
Good.

4115
02:55:15,831 --> 02:55:18,500
See if [inaudible] is there any fights 
that we missed on this UFC card?

4116
02:55:18,740 --> 02:55:21,110
I don't know how there's all these 
ready.

4117
02:55:21,420 --> 02:55:22,600
Don't worry about that.
No,

4118
02:55:22,601 --> 02:55:22,791
no,
no.

4119
02:55:22,791 --> 02:55:23,624
You've got the perfect rule set.
Let's go back to this just to see if 

4120
02:55:26,301 --> 02:55:28,340
there's anything else that Hendrix,
oh,

4121
02:55:28,341 --> 02:55:29,300
that's right.
That's right.

4122
02:55:29,301 --> 02:55:31,040
That's what I wanted to talk about,
dude.

4123
02:55:31,190 --> 02:55:33,590
You know,
you got to wonder where Johnny Hendricks

4124
02:55:33,591 --> 02:55:34,424
head is at.
When you heard the way he trained for 

4125
02:55:35,781 --> 02:55:37,250
his last fight.
You know,

4126
02:55:37,251 --> 02:55:38,084
he was saying that he was the only 
training like a few days a week and it 

4127
02:55:40,551 --> 02:55:42,080
wasn't really that steak house.

4128
02:55:42,290 --> 02:55:45,770
It wasn't really trained in every day 
and that his wife really got them geared

4129
02:55:45,771 --> 02:55:48,290
up to,
to train for this fight.

4130
02:55:48,650 --> 02:55:50,780
But the problem with that is like Neil 
Magnese's,

4131
02:55:50,781 --> 02:55:52,640
I don't fucking roll man.
I mean,

4132
02:55:52,641 --> 02:55:57,380
he's had some tough fights and some good
fights and he beat hector mother fucking

4133
02:55:57,381 --> 02:55:59,340
Lombard by stoppage,
you know?

4134
02:55:59,520 --> 02:56:01,820
That's right.
He'd be any beat Kelvin.

4135
02:56:02,020 --> 02:56:02,853
And he beat Lombard when Lombard was 
putting it to them in the first round 

4136
02:56:05,820 --> 02:56:07,730
was really close fights where it was 
like,

4137
02:56:07,731 --> 02:56:08,960
man,
this might get stopped.

4138
02:56:09,020 --> 02:56:14,000
And Damien Maia eight his ass for lunch.
Like coby has issued the way Damien Maia

4139
02:56:14,001 --> 02:56:15,620
put that smushed down on him.
I was like,

4140
02:56:15,621 --> 02:56:20,560
whilst a bad matchup stud,
next level Jujitsu batch,

4141
02:56:20,710 --> 02:56:22,010
Damien Monster,
this thing.

4142
02:56:22,250 --> 02:56:24,140
Very interesting.
First of all,

4143
02:56:24,141 --> 02:56:26,810
you got to get a hold of Woodley.
Second of all,

4144
02:56:26,811 --> 02:56:28,370
you've got to get him to the ground.

4145
02:56:28,550 --> 02:56:30,340
Good luck with both of those things.
Yeah,

4146
02:56:30,560 --> 02:56:31,393
good luck.
Both of those fucking hammered into 

4147
02:56:33,861 --> 02:56:35,300
another dementia.
It's a fun,

4148
02:56:35,301 --> 02:56:36,134
fun,
fun to Whitley and Woodley's showed him 

4149
02:56:37,101 --> 02:56:37,934
that wonderboy fight that he can hammer 
you went to a dimension in the fourth 

4150
02:56:39,741 --> 02:56:40,490
round,
correct.

4151
02:56:40,490 --> 02:56:43,130
He could still like deep into the 
fucking championship rounds,

4152
02:56:43,131 --> 02:56:46,580
can still hammering you out of this 
fucking zone flag for money.

4153
02:56:46,850 --> 02:56:51,830
We'll tell you what Jujitsu might make 
Woodley a little cautious.

4154
02:56:51,850 --> 02:56:55,730
100 [inaudible] probably not gonna throw
any leg kicks or anything,

4155
02:56:55,900 --> 02:56:58,370
but try to knock his ass out,
but we don't.

4156
02:56:58,371 --> 02:56:59,204
You think that Woodley's wrestling and 
his physical size and strength and he's 

4157
02:57:01,970 --> 02:57:02,803
taking Breslin bubbly,
strong [inaudible] no taken down 

4158
02:57:05,511 --> 02:57:06,344
restaurant.
The rest of the juicy when Damien Maia 

4159
02:57:09,440 --> 02:57:13,160
took down chill Sonin people forget that
it the man with the inverted triangle,

4160
02:57:13,200 --> 02:57:17,660
the mount that lateral dropped double 
over Hook laterals dropped him.

4161
02:57:18,500 --> 02:57:19,740
Yeah.
Yeah.

4162
02:57:20,360 --> 02:57:22,020
It's vintage Damien mind.
Yeah.

4163
02:57:22,040 --> 02:57:25,470
He got ahold of them and uh,
those is frank Mir versus car went.

4164
02:57:25,490 --> 02:57:28,310
This is horrific.
No.

4165
02:57:28,360 --> 02:57:29,150
Oh,
okay.

4166
02:57:29,150 --> 02:57:30,290
Don't worry about it.
That game.

4167
02:57:30,380 --> 02:57:32,150
Yeah.
It's probably only on fight pass.

4168
02:57:32,151 --> 02:57:35,930
If you go to UFC fight pass and we have 
a account or is it just my account?

4169
02:57:36,980 --> 02:57:38,790
Is it on?
Yeah,

4170
02:57:38,810 --> 02:57:40,160
we don't have to see it.
But anyway,

4171
02:57:40,161 --> 02:57:40,994
it was a Merch gigging marketing.
What we were talking about the 

4172
02:57:43,401 --> 02:57:45,440
difference between a guy who's like a 
super tactical,

4173
02:57:45,441 --> 02:57:46,274
really high level guy and then there's a
point of diminishing returns where it 

4174
02:57:48,561 --> 02:57:51,350
doesn't work on somebody and that's the 
point of shame.

4175
02:57:51,360 --> 02:57:53,870
Carwyn like you should like,
like almost like,

4176
02:57:53,871 --> 02:57:54,704
there's like a physical limit of almost 
all technique that you hit a wall when 

4177
02:57:59,031 --> 02:58:01,680
someone gets just so stupid strong that 
they can,

4178
02:58:01,770 --> 02:58:02,010
as long

4179
02:58:02,010 --> 02:58:04,320
as he's skilled and he is skilled on top
of that,

4180
02:58:04,350 --> 02:58:05,183
he's aware of what's going on.
He's like a Rashad Evans blackbelt like 

4181
02:58:07,351 --> 02:58:08,184
Rashad,
it's not going to submit you off his 

4182
02:58:09,181 --> 02:58:10,014
back.
But his knowledge and his defense is 

4183
02:58:11,101 --> 02:58:13,260
insane.
There's just different,

4184
02:58:13,261 --> 02:58:14,094
you know,
like he doesn't have what's going on 

4185
02:58:14,551 --> 02:58:16,140
with Rashad.
Like what happened after that?

4186
02:58:16,141 --> 02:58:16,974
Tim Kennedy fight,
they pulled them out of the Tim Kennedy 

4187
02:58:18,601 --> 02:58:19,434
fight.
They pulled him out and then he was 

4188
02:58:19,951 --> 02:58:21,460
supposed to fight again.
Right.

4189
02:58:21,470 --> 02:58:22,890
Pull them out again.
I don't know.

4190
02:58:22,920 --> 02:58:23,753
He tried to fight Kennedy again,
but this time in Toronto and Toronto 

4191
02:58:25,501 --> 02:58:26,910
pulled them out too.
I know.

4192
02:58:27,030 --> 02:58:30,640
So New York City pulled them out and 
then Toronto pulled them out and uh,

4193
02:58:30,720 --> 02:58:33,810
he says it's a preexisting condition.
He said he's something he's always had,

4194
02:58:34,560 --> 02:58:35,520
but who knows,
man,

4195
02:58:35,700 --> 02:58:37,560
I don't want to hear that.
What do you think about that Kevin?

4196
02:58:37,560 --> 02:58:40,230
Gasol them fight Jesus.
Right.

4197
02:58:40,300 --> 02:58:41,930
Okay.
No,

4198
02:58:41,940 --> 02:58:42,391
no,
no.

4199
02:58:42,391 --> 02:58:44,160
But against a Tim Kennedy,
first of all.

4200
02:58:44,190 --> 02:58:45,023
Oh yeah.
That's another example of a guy who 

4201
02:58:46,411 --> 02:58:48,420
wasn't cutting any weight and look 
fucking amazing.

4202
02:58:48,450 --> 02:58:50,520
But then he wants to go back and talk to
your boy.

4203
02:58:50,521 --> 02:58:53,790
Why is you want to go back down to 70 
because those guys have to cut weight.

4204
02:58:54,000 --> 02:58:54,833
Those guys are cutting weight and 
getting down to one 85 and they're 

4205
02:58:56,881 --> 02:58:57,714
gigantic guys like Hector Lombard and he
doesn't want to have to fight one of 

4206
02:59:00,031 --> 02:59:00,751
those guys.
Okay,

4207
02:59:00,751 --> 02:59:03,480
but you gotta make weight a seventies I 
understand what you're saying.

4208
02:59:03,510 --> 02:59:05,250
And I think there's a middle ground 
there.

4209
02:59:05,280 --> 02:59:08,430
I think seven days to harvest made one 
70 many times.

4210
02:59:08,760 --> 02:59:13,760
It's missed it the last time.
But this last time he says he was on the

4211
02:59:14,550 --> 02:59:18,210
new dieticians a regimen and it didn't 
work out.

4212
02:59:18,240 --> 02:59:19,073
Didn't work out.

4213
02:59:19,550 --> 02:59:21,870
You have dolce originally?
Yes,

4214
02:59:21,871 --> 02:59:24,090
I think so.
Did you just not want to pay the money?

4215
02:59:24,570 --> 02:59:27,080
I don't know exactly what went down 
between that.

4216
02:59:27,090 --> 02:59:30,120
He's just gotta be personally more 
disciplined if he's just personally more

4217
02:59:30,121 --> 02:59:31,680
discipline with his dye.
It's on him.

4218
02:59:31,890 --> 02:59:32,800
Yeah.
It doesn't matter.

4219
02:59:32,830 --> 02:59:34,020
The dietitian,
you know,

4220
02:59:34,021 --> 02:59:36,390
especially him cutting weight and how 
he's been doing for so long,

4221
02:59:36,391 --> 02:59:37,230
you know,
commodity.

4222
02:59:37,300 --> 02:59:40,900
Let me ask you this.
The fucking handle moves and shit make,

4223
02:59:40,910 --> 02:59:43,910
he'll accept 85,
I think one.

4224
02:59:43,920 --> 02:59:45,300
That's what I'm saying.
I think he's fine there,

4225
02:59:45,301 --> 02:59:47,660
but he's fighting veit doorbell.
Four nights that he's going to buy.

4226
02:59:47,680 --> 02:59:49,530
You Tore Belford 85.
Yo Dude,

4227
02:59:49,560 --> 02:59:50,760
that's a,
that's a rumble.

4228
02:59:50,830 --> 02:59:52,470
Yeah,
it seems Brazil.

4229
02:59:52,590 --> 02:59:55,020
Oh,
what does that mean exactly?

4230
02:59:55,560 --> 02:59:57,060
What are you trying to start his coach?
You don't know.

4231
02:59:57,820 --> 02:59:58,653
What does that mean?
You throw in Brazil is a different 

4232
03:00:00,001 --> 03:00:01,350
animal for sure.

4233
03:00:01,800 --> 03:00:03,100
Why isn't there no,
you cited there.

4234
03:00:03,380 --> 03:00:06,640
What are you trying to say?
What are you trying to save?

4235
03:00:06,770 --> 03:00:07,810
Show,
say anything.

4236
03:00:07,970 --> 03:00:08,803
What I'm saying?
There's something that I say he down 

4237
03:00:10,051 --> 03:00:10,884
there.
This is the last chance for romance for 

4238
03:00:11,941 --> 03:00:13,380
Vituro too.
It's a great,

4239
03:00:13,410 --> 03:00:16,710
it's the perfect fight for Canelo saucy,
perfect fight name.

4240
03:00:16,711 --> 03:00:18,770
Put the mits to him.
Musashi,

4241
03:00:18,780 --> 03:00:19,613
put them into v Tour and I think Kelvin 
is a better mover then Musashi Musashi 

4242
03:00:23,761 --> 03:00:24,594
has more weapons,
like loose aussies are way better 

4243
03:00:25,531 --> 03:00:26,640
kicker.
Uh,

4244
03:00:26,641 --> 03:00:30,240
but what Calvin does,
man with his footwork and that like real

4245
03:00:30,241 --> 03:00:34,580
light on his feet,
moving in with that Right Man Jab Rafael

4246
03:00:34,580 --> 03:00:36,630
Cordeiro has got,
I mean his,

4247
03:00:36,660 --> 03:00:37,800
his,
his striking look,

4248
03:00:37,801 --> 03:00:39,720
super professional,
so good and,

4249
03:00:39,730 --> 03:00:42,900
and ridiculous combinations and speed 
and fluidity.

4250
03:00:42,930 --> 03:00:45,090
That's what keeps going forward.
Keeps going,

4251
03:00:45,270 --> 03:00:46,740
keeps going forward.
So game,

4252
03:00:46,760 --> 03:00:47,710
gas,
shame game.

4253
03:00:47,730 --> 03:00:50,220
It's gas tanks retarded.
It's just so good.

4254
03:00:50,280 --> 03:00:52,530
He's so strong.
Fear Zero fear,

4255
03:00:52,531 --> 03:00:53,364
Great Chin.
Who's demeanors and saying yes and you 

4256
03:00:54,961 --> 03:00:55,794
know,
was real comfortable when tim was 

4257
03:00:57,031 --> 03:00:57,864
mauling him.
Like Tim got ahold of him early in that 

4258
03:00:59,111 --> 03:01:00,010
first round and really

4259
03:01:00,160 --> 03:01:03,160
put out a lot of effort that seatbelt 
got his back.

4260
03:01:03,400 --> 03:01:06,400
Really was mauling him with size and 
power.

4261
03:01:06,550 --> 03:01:09,610
But Tim gas himself out doing that.
Tim Look terrible in that flight.

4262
03:01:09,650 --> 03:01:11,340
Did I love Tim more than anyone in this 
world?

4263
03:01:11,350 --> 03:01:12,310
Tim,
what about me?

4264
03:01:12,340 --> 03:01:14,200
You love him more than me.
It's a tossup.

4265
03:01:14,230 --> 03:01:16,610
He'd be fighting for my freedom from my 
fridge.

4266
03:01:16,611 --> 03:01:19,150
I'm still interesting.
But uh,

4267
03:01:19,600 --> 03:01:22,870
tim looked rough in that fight.
It was a terrible performance for him,

4268
03:01:22,871 --> 03:01:25,960
but him,
nobody fucking handled themselves better

4269
03:01:26,500 --> 03:01:27,880
after loss.
Then that guy,

4270
03:01:27,940 --> 03:01:29,590
what did he say?
Fucking owns up to it.

4271
03:01:29,591 --> 03:01:31,150
The guy kicked my ass.
He's a better fighter than me.

4272
03:01:31,151 --> 03:01:31,984
It was very embarrassing.
Picture him going to the hospital at 

4273
03:01:33,571 --> 03:01:35,050
well that sucked.
Yeah.

4274
03:01:35,630 --> 03:01:36,463
Eyes face.
Totally jacked tip Kennedy took a 

4275
03:01:38,291 --> 03:01:39,790
picture of herself jacked in the 
hospital.

4276
03:01:40,270 --> 03:01:44,350
I think I s uh,
outlook on on losses,

4277
03:01:44,590 --> 03:01:46,150
losses or ou.

4278
03:01:46,150 --> 03:01:48,400
When you're in someone's corner and 
you're dealing with someone,

4279
03:01:48,401 --> 03:01:49,190
man,
it's like,

4280
03:01:49,190 --> 03:01:50,350
it's hard.
It's hard to,

4281
03:01:50,530 --> 03:01:54,520
all you can say is like there's nothing 
that says you can't win them all,

4282
03:01:54,521 --> 03:01:55,211
bro.
You got caught.

4283
03:01:55,211 --> 03:01:56,044
Anybody can get cut.
But there's a difference between like 

4284
03:01:58,301 --> 03:01:59,134
what we were saying,
like a guy like Tim Kennedy took that 

4285
03:02:00,821 --> 03:02:04,650
loss and like how hard Rhonda took her 
loss to Holly Holm.

4286
03:02:04,700 --> 03:02:05,341
Yeah,
there's a,

4287
03:02:05,341 --> 03:02:06,490
you know,
a giant difference.

4288
03:02:06,491 --> 03:02:07,324
Complete opposite.
And that's the business of being a 

4289
03:02:09,071 --> 03:02:09,904
fighter.
This game's easy when your merch in 

4290
03:02:11,150 --> 03:02:11,983
everyone,
everyone's every media outlets telling 

4291
03:02:13,631 --> 03:02:14,620
me how good you are.
Like yeah,

4292
03:02:14,621 --> 03:02:16,750
this is fucking great.
Then you take one on the chin,

4293
03:02:16,751 --> 03:02:19,300
you lose.
Most fighters come back and go,

4294
03:02:19,610 --> 03:02:20,560
all right,
I got merch.

4295
03:02:20,561 --> 03:02:22,300
But watch this fight.
You'll see what's up.

4296
03:02:22,301 --> 03:02:23,134
I'm a real fighter.
That's why tim or you eat Kelvin's had 

4297
03:02:26,531 --> 03:02:26,950
his loss.

4298
03:02:26,950 --> 03:02:29,250
Is everyone that many.
Then Connor,

4299
03:02:29,330 --> 03:02:30,163
you know he came back,
he was already talking shit after that 

4300
03:02:31,901 --> 03:02:33,050
fight.
He was like in a fuckhead.

4301
03:02:33,060 --> 03:02:34,420
I fucked up,
but I'll be back.

4302
03:02:34,421 --> 03:02:36,970
Took it like a man and didn't talk about
a staph infection.

4303
03:02:36,971 --> 03:02:38,020
By the way,
a lot of people,

4304
03:02:38,021 --> 03:02:38,854
when we found out about us sat staph 
infection because of my fucking big 

4305
03:02:40,991 --> 03:02:41,824
mouth,
but he had a staph infection two weeks 

4306
03:02:43,001 --> 03:02:45,820
out of that first nate diaz fight.
He was taking antibiotics.

4307
03:02:46,210 --> 03:02:48,700
That's the word might be.
I don't think it's bullshit.

4308
03:02:48,730 --> 03:02:50,050
I haven't heard it directly from his 
mouth,

4309
03:02:50,051 --> 03:02:51,580
but I heard it from a very reliable 
sources.

4310
03:02:51,610 --> 03:02:53,620
Do you hear what his camp is doing?
What are they doing?

4311
03:02:53,740 --> 03:02:58,000
His coach is requiring every fight on 
his team to have their brain scan.

4312
03:02:58,030 --> 03:02:59,380
Fuck yeah,
John Kavanagh.

4313
03:02:59,410 --> 03:03:00,300
Fuck yeah.
Right.

4314
03:03:00,310 --> 03:03:01,720
Powerful move.
Smart Guy,

4315
03:03:01,721 --> 03:03:04,360
man.
Fuck yeah.

4316
03:03:04,900 --> 03:03:06,730
This is a crazy sport.
You know,

4317
03:03:06,731 --> 03:03:08,860
and no one wants to tell people when 
they can and can't do it,

4318
03:03:08,890 --> 03:03:09,723
but someone should be watching out for 
them because that fucking same ego that 

4319
03:03:13,901 --> 03:03:18,370
makes you want to be a champion can also
get you real confused as to when you are

4320
03:03:18,371 --> 03:03:19,204
physically compromised,
which brings us to the fight that was 

4321
03:03:21,011 --> 03:03:24,610
pulled off this card,
Cain Velasquez versus fabrizio for doom.

4322
03:03:24,640 --> 03:03:25,473
The rematch,
which everybody was looking forward to 

4323
03:03:27,160 --> 03:03:30,810
and a cane did that meeting with that,
uh,

4324
03:03:30,960 --> 03:03:32,370
that,
whatever that meant.

4325
03:03:32,500 --> 03:03:33,810
A association.
Yes.

4326
03:03:33,820 --> 03:03:34,653
The Fighters Association and said that 
he's going to have to have a surgery 

4327
03:03:37,541 --> 03:03:39,070
after this fight.
And they went,

4328
03:03:39,730 --> 03:03:40,563
what?
Why don't you step that he fucked up 

4329
03:03:43,380 --> 03:03:43,841
you.
They like,

4330
03:03:43,841 --> 03:03:47,260
you can't say you need a surgery before 
you have a major fight.

4331
03:03:47,261 --> 03:03:48,094
First of all,
that that's going to fuck with the 

4332
03:03:49,481 --> 03:03:50,290
betting lines.

4333
03:03:50,290 --> 03:03:51,123
There's a disaster there that's going to
fuck with the insurance if something 

4334
03:03:53,831 --> 03:03:56,020
happens to you.
And then afterwards they say,

4335
03:03:56,050 --> 03:03:56,651
Oh,
you know,

4336
03:03:56,651 --> 03:03:59,060
you,
you told us that you are already hurt.

4337
03:03:59,061 --> 03:04:01,160
We're not paying for this.
Like do you,

4338
03:04:01,190 --> 03:04:02,840
do you get paid?
Um,

4339
03:04:02,960 --> 03:04:03,793
for like when you're in training camp 
and you get to a fight and you have to 

4340
03:04:07,341 --> 03:04:09,140
pull out because the injury,
you don't get nothing.

4341
03:04:09,230 --> 03:04:10,310
Right?
What do you get?

4342
03:04:11,240 --> 03:04:12,170
Uh,
nothing.

4343
03:04:12,260 --> 03:04:13,490
Nothing.
So you've got nothing.

4344
03:04:13,730 --> 03:04:15,770
So if he chose to fight with that 
injury,

4345
03:04:15,771 --> 03:04:16,604
he said he was gonna be 100%.
He's going to have a cortisone 

4346
03:04:17,601 --> 03:04:19,740
injection.
And the doctors disagree.

4347
03:04:19,741 --> 03:04:22,310
The Nevada State Athletic Commission 
disagreed that uh,

4348
03:04:22,340 --> 03:04:24,200
Bob Bennett Guy,
he doesn't fucking play any games,

4349
03:04:24,201 --> 03:04:24,680
man.
He's like,

4350
03:04:24,680 --> 03:04:28,640
you can't say something like that.
And then finally long to do that.

4351
03:04:28,641 --> 03:04:29,474
I fucked up.
He fucked up emotional when I called 

4352
03:04:31,781 --> 03:04:33,050
Linacre a little monkey earlier.

4353
03:04:33,230 --> 03:04:35,390
I fucked up.
See came fucked up.

4354
03:04:35,391 --> 03:04:36,920
You just talk,
you say things,

4355
03:04:37,100 --> 03:04:38,480
you know,
I was going to say,

4356
03:04:38,481 --> 03:04:41,090
well that's kind of racist,
but I call myself a monkey though.

4357
03:04:41,120 --> 03:04:41,953
I just,
it sounds sounds worse than it really 

4358
03:04:42,921 --> 03:04:44,060
is.
It's not racist.

4359
03:04:44,061 --> 03:04:44,894
It's not the last person racist.
But the point is with when it comes to 

4360
03:04:48,471 --> 03:04:49,304
Cain is that it was a giant error and 
that error pulled him off of this card 

4361
03:04:52,190 --> 03:04:53,023
and now he's going to have to fight.
He's going to have to get surgery and 

4362
03:04:55,581 --> 03:04:57,750
then he'd have to fight whoever the fuck
has left and it's,

4363
03:04:57,770 --> 03:05:01,910
you're talking about more months out and
then even more examination next time and

4364
03:05:01,911 --> 03:05:03,460
it's going to cost him a shit load of 
money.

4365
03:05:03,520 --> 03:05:05,480
A ton of money went through the entire 
camp.

4366
03:05:05,510 --> 03:05:07,760
He was a week out and they pull them 
from it.

4367
03:05:07,820 --> 03:05:09,710
And then he was saying,
I don't know what this is about.

4368
03:05:09,720 --> 03:05:11,180
I'm,
I'm 100% good to go.

4369
03:05:11,330 --> 03:05:14,330
I've been told I've been cleared.
So he was tweeting that he had been told

4370
03:05:14,331 --> 03:05:16,400
that he was cleared right before they 
pull them.

4371
03:05:17,120 --> 03:05:18,530
I thought,
you know,

4372
03:05:18,531 --> 03:05:21,230
I think you give the guy a physical 
examination in terms of his movement.

4373
03:05:21,260 --> 03:05:22,310
Like what can you do?
Like,

4374
03:05:22,580 --> 03:05:24,540
how do you,
how do you tell a guy business wise,

4375
03:05:24,860 --> 03:05:25,693
business wise,
you can look in his bag back some since 

4376
03:05:27,441 --> 03:05:30,290
I ask the as you can't cause the UFC 
goes man,

4377
03:05:30,291 --> 03:05:31,124
you have a bulging disk,
you can of course on the shot and then 

4378
03:05:32,991 --> 03:05:33,824
if you get punched in the face by doing 
where he gets a guilty and you're 

4379
03:05:35,631 --> 03:05:37,730
paralyzed,
you assumed the fuck out us cause we let

4380
03:05:37,731 --> 03:05:39,740
your true business,
you just can't do that.

4381
03:05:39,770 --> 03:05:41,810
No deny.
I don't think it falls on.

4382
03:05:42,190 --> 03:05:43,023
Kay came knows better.
The people around this association 

4383
03:05:46,340 --> 03:05:47,600
shouldn't have let them do that.

4384
03:05:47,630 --> 03:05:48,463
Well first of all they should have known
about first the bjorn revenue thing is 

4385
03:05:51,381 --> 03:05:52,214
very weird.
Like I was reading what John Fitch had 

4386
03:05:53,361 --> 03:05:54,194
written that John Fitch rather than an 
interview said that he was very 

4387
03:05:57,020 --> 03:06:00,350
disturbed by all this because there's a 
class action lawsuit.

4388
03:06:00,351 --> 03:06:01,184
And what they're saying is that if the 
class action lawsuit is dropped like 

4389
03:06:05,961 --> 03:06:07,910
that they could form this,
uh,

4390
03:06:07,911 --> 03:06:08,744
this union.
And if they all agreed to abandon the 

4391
03:06:11,841 --> 03:06:13,700
class action lawsuit,
it would,

4392
03:06:13,730 --> 03:06:15,950
it would like help the strength and form
the union.

4393
03:06:16,130 --> 03:06:17,450
And John Fitch was like,
what?

4394
03:06:17,510 --> 03:06:18,343
Like,
so you're saying that the UFC would 

4395
03:06:19,731 --> 03:06:20,564
accept you as a union if you abandoned 
the class action lawsuit that we'd been 

4396
03:06:23,811 --> 03:06:26,660
chasing down for two years now without 
picking any sides.

4397
03:06:27,320 --> 03:06:28,760
Like if you're on the side of the 
fighters,

4398
03:06:28,790 --> 03:06:31,190
not picking any sides,
you just have to look at that and go,

4399
03:06:31,191 --> 03:06:32,024
well what benefit would it be for the 
people that are not in this to accept 

4400
03:06:35,420 --> 03:06:37,130
that the class action lawsuit is 
dropped?

4401
03:06:37,131 --> 03:06:37,964
This all sounds like someone's trying to
get some money because there's no one's 

4402
03:06:41,181 --> 03:06:42,014
doing this for free.
That's what everybody has to realize 

4403
03:06:43,401 --> 03:06:44,234
when it comes to like these agencies and
there's like three different competing 

4404
03:06:46,941 --> 03:06:48,320
ones that are stepping in.
Right?

4405
03:06:49,130 --> 03:06:50,660
There's the associate,
the two big ones.

4406
03:06:50,661 --> 03:06:53,570
There's associations as the union.
Yeah.

4407
03:06:53,630 --> 03:06:56,130
Well ultimately I think we all want the 
same

4408
03:06:56,130 --> 03:06:56,963
thing.
We all want fighters to be compensated 

4409
03:06:58,471 --> 03:07:00,150
fairly.
Want them to make a lot of money because

4410
03:07:00,151 --> 03:07:02,640
it's a short window of time and it's an 
awesome sport to watch.

4411
03:07:02,850 --> 03:07:03,720
Right?
Correct.

4412
03:07:04,620 --> 03:07:07,320
So you got wonder,
does this help that?

4413
03:07:07,350 --> 03:07:10,470
Does this help them?
Does it do any of these organizations?

4414
03:07:10,650 --> 03:07:11,483
They haven't yet because if they can't 
even get together and organize and 

4415
03:07:14,911 --> 03:07:17,610
they're going to fight right,
then no one's going to take you serious.

4416
03:07:17,630 --> 03:07:19,560
There's three different leaders,
three different ones,

4417
03:07:19,680 --> 03:07:20,513
and they all want different things.
And then you've got to wonder whose 

4418
03:07:22,501 --> 03:07:24,690
agenda's over here?
Whose agenda's over here?

4419
03:07:24,870 --> 03:07:27,210
What it has to come.
It can't come from businessman,

4420
03:07:27,390 --> 03:07:30,510
can't come from another promoter.
How's it come from the fighters,

4421
03:07:30,511 --> 03:07:31,830
the fighters.
You know what I'm saying?

4422
03:07:31,950 --> 03:07:32,783
You know,
and I'm not saying current fighters 

4423
03:07:33,671 --> 03:07:34,504
because they need to fight and then they
need to have someone speak for them 

4424
03:07:37,051 --> 03:07:37,884
who's been there.

4425
03:07:38,070 --> 03:07:38,903
But you can't have these business guys 
with other hidden agendas trying to get 

4426
03:07:41,911 --> 03:07:42,744
things done.
Or,

4427
03:07:42,810 --> 03:07:45,030
or in a b,
orange case,

4428
03:07:45,031 --> 03:07:48,960
he has this weird jealousy with Dana and
let's see them destroyed.

4429
03:07:48,961 --> 03:07:49,830
Well,
we can't have that.

4430
03:07:49,890 --> 03:07:51,720
Why are you speaking for us?
What are you doing?

4431
03:07:52,270 --> 03:07:53,780
You don't have the respect of the 
fighters.

4432
03:07:53,790 --> 03:07:54,623
What the fuck are you doing?
And notice he's taking a seat back 

4433
03:07:56,970 --> 03:07:58,800
because everyone,
when everyone saw him speaking,

4434
03:07:58,830 --> 03:07:59,770
they were like,
we're out man.

4435
03:08:00,030 --> 03:08:00,863
Like he was going old school bell tour 
when he was running things over there 

4436
03:08:04,050 --> 03:08:04,883
and a King Mo was pissed off at him and 
King Mo most of this day calls him a 

4437
03:08:08,821 --> 03:08:11,520
Dick Rider all the time.
It's not good when you've got a guy like

4438
03:08:11,521 --> 03:08:15,270
king mo who's a very respected guy who 
has horrible things to say about you.

4439
03:08:15,340 --> 03:08:17,130
And I talked to association.

4440
03:08:17,130 --> 03:08:18,210
I went,
what are you guys doing?

4441
03:08:18,211 --> 03:08:18,840
Like,
yeah,

4442
03:08:18,840 --> 03:08:21,720
you have one way to make an impression 
and you do this.

4443
03:08:21,721 --> 03:08:23,790
You put your best foot forward with this
guy.

4444
03:08:23,940 --> 03:08:24,630
And they're like,
well,

4445
03:08:24,630 --> 03:08:26,280
I don't know the dude.
Do you know him?

4446
03:08:26,970 --> 03:08:29,850
I know of fighters who have dealt with 
them.

4447
03:08:29,940 --> 03:08:33,900
I never thought for Bella tour.
So I know inside the fighter circle that

4448
03:08:33,901 --> 03:08:36,300
people have dealt with them for managing
and stuff like that.

4449
03:08:36,530 --> 03:08:37,363
But I him personally,
I was looking at all the tweets and all 

4450
03:08:39,061 --> 03:08:39,894
the negative stuff.
I think you can take a very positive 

4451
03:08:42,001 --> 03:08:42,834
angle about improving the life and the 
conditions of these fighters without 

4452
03:08:46,201 --> 03:08:47,400
attacking people.
Yeah,

4453
03:08:47,401 --> 03:08:48,690
there's no,
there's no reason to attack.

4454
03:08:48,691 --> 03:08:50,880
And it's also see what you want about 
Dana White.

4455
03:08:50,881 --> 03:08:51,714
It's not his job to make sure you guys 
get your shit together and formed the 

4456
03:08:54,270 --> 03:08:55,350
association.
He's like,

4457
03:08:55,351 --> 03:08:56,250
I'm a businessman.

4458
03:08:56,280 --> 03:08:58,200
I put on fights.
If you guys want to do that,

4459
03:08:58,350 --> 03:09:00,460
cool.
Get your shit together and then bring it

4460
03:09:00,560 --> 03:09:01,393
and then let's figure something out.
But if you guys are fighting with each 

4461
03:09:03,031 --> 03:09:04,260
other,
you don't even acknowledge,

4462
03:09:04,261 --> 03:09:05,610
you know what else is interesting about 
this,

4463
03:09:05,611 --> 03:09:07,850
uh,
the $4 billion that you know,

4464
03:09:07,920 --> 03:09:11,340
is that they had to pay to buy the EOC 
and there's a lot of debt.

4465
03:09:11,910 --> 03:09:13,470
I wonder how,
how do you,

4466
03:09:13,471 --> 03:09:14,720
I don't understand business.
I'm,

4467
03:09:14,740 --> 03:09:15,780
I'm a dummy.
I don't,

4468
03:09:15,810 --> 03:09:16,643
I don't have any business background,
but how much money do you have to make 

4469
03:09:20,190 --> 03:09:21,023
to pay off $4 billion?
Like if you buy a house and your house 

4470
03:09:23,491 --> 03:09:25,490
is like 3 million bucks,
like damn,

4471
03:09:25,491 --> 03:09:28,050
we like doing,
get some daunting 30 year payments.

4472
03:09:28,350 --> 03:09:33,350
Now imagine a thousand times that plus a
billion because that's what it is,

4473
03:09:38,570 --> 03:09:39,403
but thousand million billion is,
and that's why they're going and doing 

4474
03:09:42,451 --> 03:09:43,284
these budget cuts saying,
how can we save money here and how can 

4475
03:09:44,851 --> 03:09:45,330
we grow it?

4476
03:09:45,330 --> 03:09:48,930
So then you see all of a sudden you see 
the women 140 pound division,

4477
03:09:49,130 --> 03:09:51,690
you're seeing these into 45,
one 45.

4478
03:09:51,691 --> 03:09:53,830
You've seen these interim belts.
You're seeing ways to,

4479
03:09:54,130 --> 03:09:55,240
you know,
make up the money.

4480
03:09:55,510 --> 03:09:56,343
Well,
that's a really sad thing about the 

4481
03:09:57,431 --> 03:10:01,690
cyborg thing because cyborgs extremely 
marketable at 145 pounds.

4482
03:10:01,720 --> 03:10:03,850
And they make the decision for her.
Yeah.

4483
03:10:03,851 --> 03:10:05,890
They made the division for her and not 
just marketable,

4484
03:10:05,891 --> 03:10:08,470
but very controversial,
very controversial,

4485
03:10:08,471 --> 03:10:09,041
very.
I mean,

4486
03:10:09,041 --> 03:10:10,380
she's scary.
She,

4487
03:10:10,460 --> 03:10:11,293
she merck's women,
she goes after them and it takes them 

4488
03:10:12,791 --> 03:10:13,800
down,
destroys him,

4489
03:10:13,870 --> 03:10:15,820
smashes people.
She's in her thirties.

4490
03:10:15,850 --> 03:10:17,530
I think she's 34,
35 cause she,

4491
03:10:17,531 --> 03:10:22,531
that'll I think so.
Pull up three 30 on June 32 31.

4492
03:10:23,321 --> 03:10:24,154
Okay,
I'm wrong.

4493
03:10:24,340 --> 03:10:25,480
Um,
so,

4494
03:10:25,481 --> 03:10:26,350
uh,
31,

4495
03:10:26,351 --> 03:10:27,670
it's in her prime,
you know,

4496
03:10:27,720 --> 03:10:31,390
in her prime and for her to be the 
champion at one 45 this she could be,

4497
03:10:31,391 --> 03:10:32,224
she could,
the problem is she's going to be an 

4498
03:10:33,160 --> 03:10:34,100
under even more screwed.

4499
03:10:34,100 --> 03:10:34,933
She's so fucking mad and there's never 
been someone who fucking need to pass 

4500
03:10:38,451 --> 03:10:39,284
the test so bad in their life than her 
because the number one knock on her was 

4501
03:10:42,100 --> 03:10:42,933
you've test pause before.
That's the only reason why you're 

4502
03:10:43,991 --> 03:10:45,430
competing.
That's what you're knocking people out.

4503
03:10:45,620 --> 03:10:47,680
But fell off that train was like,
no,

4504
03:10:47,681 --> 03:10:49,420
she's so skilled.
She deserves it.

4505
03:10:49,421 --> 03:10:51,370
Put marketing dollars behind her.
They're like fine,

4506
03:10:51,371 --> 03:10:52,450
cool.
Here's your division.

4507
03:10:52,750 --> 03:10:53,583
Boom test positive but put,
put yourself in or is it possible that 

4508
03:10:57,101 --> 03:11:02,101
she really did deal with some crazy 
weight cutting backlash where her body's

4509
03:11:02,351 --> 03:11:06,730
just like fucked up and it's retaining 
water in some weird way and our hormones

4510
03:11:06,731 --> 03:11:08,570
are all fucked up cause she got on the 
birth control pill.

4511
03:11:08,571 --> 03:11:09,404
I believe that it's possible that a 
doctor did prescribe her this to try to 

4512
03:11:11,771 --> 03:11:12,604
mitigate that.
And then the doctor told her that you 

4513
03:11:14,051 --> 03:11:15,340
could take this out of competition.

4514
03:11:15,340 --> 03:11:18,400
You can't take it into in competition 
because it is a diuretic,

4515
03:11:18,401 --> 03:11:19,234
right?
Yeah.

4516
03:11:19,390 --> 03:11:20,223
So a diuretic,
if you are swollen and all those things 

4517
03:11:22,481 --> 03:11:23,680
do seem to make sense.
I mean,

4518
03:11:23,681 --> 03:11:24,514
just trying to be done.
I don't wanna I don't wanna see any 

4519
03:11:25,721 --> 03:11:27,670
skeptical hippo face.
I'm not,

4520
03:11:27,690 --> 03:11:28,640
I'm,
I'm,

4521
03:11:28,710 --> 03:11:30,020
I'm with you on this July.
No,

4522
03:11:30,080 --> 03:11:34,300
I actually believe her story.
Have you seen skeptical snake?

4523
03:11:34,660 --> 03:11:35,231
I,
yeah,

4524
03:11:35,231 --> 03:11:37,480
I sent septal.
I blew up skeptical snake.

4525
03:11:38,410 --> 03:11:39,520
So send me that.
What?

4526
03:11:39,550 --> 03:11:41,230
I have to post this.
Where did you find it?

4527
03:11:41,350 --> 03:11:46,350
And the guy goes just for you.
Shall I see you're skeptical hippo and I

4528
03:11:47,051 --> 03:11:49,280
raise you a super skeptical snake.
Yeah.

4529
03:11:49,330 --> 03:11:51,880
This is fucking snake.
I might've seen on your instagram.

4530
03:11:51,881 --> 03:11:54,310
So skeptical.
Have you seen any daddy?

4531
03:11:55,030 --> 03:11:56,830
No.
It should be.

4532
03:11:56,831 --> 03:11:58,720
This should be your,
your mascot.

4533
03:12:00,040 --> 03:12:02,340
Whenever you watch CNN,
this should pop up.

4534
03:12:03,670 --> 03:12:08,670
This is a new meme.
This is a new media is fake news.

4535
03:12:11,051 --> 03:12:16,051
So no pizza needs to be the main news 
site like in his fucking,

4536
03:12:20,110 --> 03:12:21,820
oh look at you wrote,
look at you rail,

4537
03:12:21,830 --> 03:12:23,140
pull it aside.
My face,

4538
03:12:23,141 --> 03:12:26,860
when I watch a UFC promo these days,
I see you're skeptical lip and raise you

4539
03:12:26,861 --> 03:12:29,410
a super skeptical state.
That's exact where for everybody at Bro,

4540
03:12:29,710 --> 03:12:31,820
that's because they're not showing 
Amanda Nunes.

4541
03:12:33,070 --> 03:12:35,050
It is kind of fucked up,
but it's also,

4542
03:12:35,051 --> 03:12:35,884
you know,
like someone pointed out like when 

4543
03:12:36,851 --> 03:12:37,684
you're watching these promos,
their movies now it's like this little 

4544
03:12:39,701 --> 03:12:41,920
film.
It's not like training footage.

4545
03:12:41,921 --> 03:12:45,940
People talking about it like this really
slickly produced movie thing.

4546
03:12:45,960 --> 03:12:47,890
The story is fucking great.
Oh,

4547
03:12:47,891 --> 03:12:49,120
Amanda Nunez.
The story's great.

4548
03:12:49,490 --> 03:12:51,830
Yeah.
First openly gay world champion.

4549
03:12:52,280 --> 03:12:55,430
Fricking Brazilian.
I mean knock out a highlight reel,

4550
03:12:55,460 --> 03:12:58,840
highlight reels,
smack her fucking work.

4551
03:12:59,090 --> 03:13:01,450
Like she's the devil and then,
and then we,

4552
03:13:01,500 --> 03:13:02,930
they don't show any Rhonda Kaos.

4553
03:13:02,930 --> 03:13:03,763
It's like that.
Just like men in black where they just 

4554
03:13:05,211 --> 03:13:06,044
won't,
he's a [inaudible] and erase that from 

4555
03:13:06,801 --> 03:13:08,380
your memory.
They'll just many that,

4556
03:13:08,510 --> 03:13:10,340
plenty of that video going around on its
own.

4557
03:13:10,460 --> 03:13:11,293
Everybody knows what happened.
It's not something you needed to 

4558
03:13:12,461 --> 03:13:13,294
discuss.
I think they could have done it in that 

4559
03:13:15,381 --> 03:13:16,214
video and then show him the workout to 
the return and it might be even more 

4560
03:13:19,341 --> 03:13:22,430
dramatic shown are crying,
showing her building back up,

4561
03:13:22,431 --> 03:13:24,020
picking up the pieces again.
I mean that,

4562
03:13:24,040 --> 03:13:24,561
that,
I mean,

4563
03:13:24,561 --> 03:13:26,270
if you wanted to go deep,
you could,

4564
03:13:26,330 --> 03:13:27,740
that's going to be in the movie,
right?

4565
03:13:27,741 --> 03:13:28,574
If you have a Rhonda Rousey life story 
movie that's gotta be in the movie 

4566
03:13:30,960 --> 03:13:33,740
course a hundred percent if she comes 
back and wins,

4567
03:13:33,830 --> 03:13:35,630
I mean,
that's exactly what you're gonna see.

4568
03:13:35,660 --> 03:13:39,170
You're gonna see all the pain Ronda 
Rousey today right now.

4569
03:13:39,230 --> 03:13:42,320
I mean,
she is who she is right now.

4570
03:13:42,320 --> 03:13:44,960
What's going on right now is because 
what happened with Holly Holm,

4571
03:13:45,130 --> 03:13:47,220
you know this is her comeback does,
is it,

4572
03:13:47,450 --> 03:13:49,880
can she pull off the comeback?
I mean,

4573
03:13:50,060 --> 03:13:51,980
the only reason you ain't gotta come 
back against who?

4574
03:13:52,010 --> 03:13:54,380
Like I said,
the average Fan's gone come back against

4575
03:13:54,381 --> 03:13:56,630
who she has been the favorite in every 
fight she's ever been,

4576
03:13:57,110 --> 03:13:57,943
had a complete blackout of Amanda Nunez.
Like they haven't showed shit at all 

4577
03:14:00,681 --> 03:14:03,500
just now.
There's very little footage that they're

4578
03:14:03,501 --> 03:14:05,600
showing in these problems.
They're showing Nunez.

4579
03:14:05,750 --> 03:14:08,270
Stop watching boxing as to put it back 
on fucking,

4580
03:14:08,271 --> 03:14:11,660
yeah,
cause I don't see an fs one.

4581
03:14:12,410 --> 03:14:14,290
Where on boxing that work.
I'll like that.

4582
03:14:14,300 --> 03:14:15,133
Joe tweeted them know I tweeted a big 
wall like while I was watching it at 

4583
03:14:17,781 --> 03:14:19,100
home,
I was watching,

4584
03:14:19,101 --> 03:14:19,934
I was actually in a hotel room.
I was watching that UFC on Fox where 

4585
03:14:23,151 --> 03:14:26,280
Michelle waterson beat paige vanzant and
I was watching.

4586
03:14:26,280 --> 03:14:29,470
I'm like this is so bizarre.
They're not showing the champion to show

4587
03:14:29,471 --> 03:14:34,070
in this giant Promo and it's all Rhonda.
Which makes some sense because Rhonda is

4588
03:14:34,071 --> 03:14:34,904
huge.
You want to let everybody know that 

4589
03:14:35,931 --> 03:14:38,510
she's coming back,
but don't you want to let everybody know

4590
03:14:38,511 --> 03:14:39,344
that she's coming back against a killer 
against you want everybody to know that 

4591
03:14:41,211 --> 03:14:43,130
she's coming back to fight the champion.
Joe,

4592
03:14:43,131 --> 03:14:47,570
just just from a business aspect,
what in some weird world in mma,

4593
03:14:47,571 --> 03:14:50,710
what if Amanda Nunez Mercer in the first
year she has look,

4594
03:14:50,780 --> 03:14:51,800
no one knows it.
Yes.

4595
03:14:51,810 --> 03:14:54,170
Is one of them.
One of them you see in her face,

4596
03:14:54,440 --> 03:14:55,273
she just see her face.
But like most of the pieces about 

4597
03:14:57,141 --> 03:14:58,400
Rhonda,
but there's a few of these,

4598
03:14:58,401 --> 03:14:59,630
right?
There's a few different ones.

4599
03:15:00,010 --> 03:15:01,070
Do you know?
Do you know what I'm saying?

4600
03:15:01,071 --> 03:15:01,904
Joe?
What happened that she makes Ronnie 

4601
03:15:02,490 --> 03:15:02,670
there?

4602
03:15:02,670 --> 03:15:03,503
They showed,
they showed her head kick somebody 

4603
03:15:06,651 --> 03:15:07,610
else's trailer,
Bro.

4604
03:15:07,640 --> 03:15:11,600
This isn't created shit.
That's okay.

4605
03:15:11,700 --> 03:15:12,533
You don't have to,
it's going be a lot longer than an 

4606
03:15:14,751 --> 03:15:15,584
actual promo too.
Like how long has that video right 

4607
03:15:16,851 --> 03:15:18,080
there?
Those two minutes?

4608
03:15:18,110 --> 03:15:19,520
Yeah.
Do you see what I'm saying?

4609
03:15:19,521 --> 03:15:20,900
Angela?
What happens if some weird,

4610
03:15:20,960 --> 03:15:22,880
some weird MMA world?
Amanda,

4611
03:15:23,060 --> 03:15:24,890
I heard this weird at all and then we're
going,

4612
03:15:25,070 --> 03:15:26,810
do you think that's weird?
Not at all.

4613
03:15:27,110 --> 03:15:29,370
No.
It's real dangerous place is acting like

4614
03:15:29,420 --> 03:15:30,253
they're putting all their chips in this 
basket where if Amanda Nunez does her 

4615
03:15:33,321 --> 03:15:35,610
thing and it happens,
people go,

4616
03:15:35,730 --> 03:15:36,800
who the fuck?
Just one.

4617
03:15:36,830 --> 03:15:40,480
But Rhonda is a thousand times more 
popular.

4618
03:15:40,760 --> 03:15:41,593
Popular Than Amanda Nunez.
Hundred percent a hundred percent where 

4619
03:15:43,051 --> 03:15:46,160
the money's coming from money yet,
but every,

4620
03:15:46,390 --> 03:15:48,140
okay,
you've already established she runs it,

4621
03:15:48,141 --> 03:15:48,974
but hold on.
You're already the Ron is finding what 

4622
03:15:50,251 --> 03:15:51,150
you want everybody to know.

4623
03:15:51,160 --> 03:15:52,650
She's fighting a killer.
Who she fighting.

4624
03:15:52,680 --> 03:15:55,140
That's what we're tuned in in it.
You will see the matchup,

4625
03:15:55,840 --> 03:15:59,580
what selling it as if the whole thing 
that you're seeing is her coming back.

4626
03:16:00,510 --> 03:16:01,940
Yeah,
but I'm saying in some,

4627
03:16:02,190 --> 03:16:07,020
in business 101 what happened if that 
other person wins and we don't know shit

4628
03:16:07,021 --> 03:16:08,430
about her.
You have to say channel.

4629
03:16:08,431 --> 03:16:09,780
This is it.
Yeah.

4630
03:16:11,310 --> 03:16:15,660
There's just not much of it.
You see a bunch of different,

4631
03:16:15,740 --> 03:16:19,010
if she wins then they'll blow her up.
There's still timing.

4632
03:16:19,310 --> 03:16:20,143
We have a deadline.
If she willing can fight Ronda Rousey 

4633
03:16:22,051 --> 03:16:27,030
once this one manage maybe or amy,
if Rhonda gets work twice,

4634
03:16:27,510 --> 03:16:28,480
there's no room.
Who knows?

4635
03:16:28,500 --> 03:16:30,430
But at least you know that's the girl 
that beat I met.

4636
03:16:30,480 --> 03:16:33,090
She'll be just like Holly Holm,
instantly huge and on,

4637
03:16:33,091 --> 03:16:36,540
on fucking Ellyn and all that shit.
Holly's in an interesting place to write

4638
03:16:36,541 --> 03:16:37,800
cause she was instantly huge.

4639
03:16:37,830 --> 03:16:39,840
And then she loses two in a row 
straight.

4640
03:16:40,170 --> 03:16:41,370
Yeah.
And she loses to,

4641
03:16:41,371 --> 03:16:42,204
to like two completely different styles.
She gets choked out by Meesha against a 

4642
03:16:45,211 --> 03:16:46,044
better grappler.
And then she gets a check the lot by 

4643
03:16:48,430 --> 03:16:50,780
volunteership Chenko and Mount John.
Tina just,

4644
03:16:51,120 --> 03:16:52,890
I would like to see that promo if it's 
possible.

4645
03:16:52,891 --> 03:16:56,130
Jamie at the UFC,
one of the on the UFC.

4646
03:16:56,131 --> 03:16:56,964
Youtube.
I know it's youtube but there's no real 

4647
03:16:59,431 --> 03:17:00,480
bro.
It's not real.

4648
03:17:00,510 --> 03:17:01,343
It's your library tube.
So here's her like in the top of her 

4649
03:17:03,271 --> 03:17:06,090
feet.
Your promos from arm bar people too.

4650
03:17:06,210 --> 03:17:07,890
You get them from CNN.
We all know that.

4651
03:17:08,160 --> 03:17:11,160
Smashing people.
So this is uh,

4652
03:17:11,250 --> 03:17:13,470
is this the same one as the cartoons is 
a different one.

4653
03:17:13,500 --> 03:17:14,333
This is the holly fires holly.
So this is going to show it at the end 

4654
03:17:17,640 --> 03:17:18,720
of November.
What happened there?

4655
03:17:18,780 --> 03:17:20,850
They'd all show show it.
They cut.

4656
03:17:20,850 --> 03:17:23,280
Oh they go black and then you see holly 
winning.

4657
03:17:23,310 --> 03:17:24,600
Wow.
See what she,

4658
03:17:24,660 --> 03:17:25,493
what she likes skeptical snake.
Well you got to like go down more in 

4659
03:17:28,900 --> 03:17:31,410
your face has to be done on morning 
planning actually.

4660
03:17:31,411 --> 03:17:33,070
Like you see he's up,
right?

4661
03:17:33,080 --> 03:17:35,610
Cause progression of the mouse and the 
progression of the belt.

4662
03:17:35,640 --> 03:17:36,473
You see the progression of the belt.
But you don't see her getting head 

4663
03:17:38,071 --> 03:17:39,630
kicked.
That's crazy.

4664
03:17:40,500 --> 03:17:42,480
Why would you not show the highlight?
Wow.

4665
03:17:42,650 --> 03:17:43,483
What what you're doing is you're showing
preferential treatment for one athlete 

4666
03:17:45,901 --> 03:17:49,710
without a doubt.
And the idea is that the ability and the

4667
03:17:49,711 --> 03:17:50,544
fame that she's reached you,
you show preferential treatment because 

4668
03:17:53,611 --> 03:17:54,960
she's different.
She's special,

4669
03:17:55,140 --> 03:17:58,140
she's different.
She's doing massive star.

4670
03:17:58,230 --> 03:17:59,650
She has a massive star.
That's the,

4671
03:17:59,660 --> 03:18:02,880
that's the girl that's going to put this
the asses in the seats right there,

4672
03:18:02,970 --> 03:18:04,890
man.
She's got busier than conor though.

4673
03:18:05,480 --> 03:18:07,230
I think you're right.
But as far as women go,

4674
03:18:07,231 --> 03:18:08,680
she is the,
the corner of the timeout.

4675
03:18:08,710 --> 03:18:11,560
The fighters.
I'm talking about fighters division.

4676
03:18:11,600 --> 03:18:12,500
It's not even close.
No,

4677
03:18:12,510 --> 03:18:14,460
not even close.
There's no one like there's no one like,

4678
03:18:14,500 --> 03:18:17,190
but just cause connor sells more tickets
doesn't mean she's,

4679
03:18:17,830 --> 03:18:20,480
they have multiple stores,
multiple elite stars.

4680
03:18:20,540 --> 03:18:21,373
And here you see Amanda doing some 
workouts just lifting some weights or 

4681
03:18:27,150 --> 03:18:29,310
girlfriend's a straw weight in the UFC.
Is She?

4682
03:18:29,370 --> 03:18:32,340
Yeah.
World Bantamweight champion.

4683
03:18:32,341 --> 03:18:33,900
Amanda Nunez.
And then you see some highlights.

4684
03:18:33,901 --> 03:18:37,460
So this one is showing more.
So this is a different one than the one.

4685
03:18:38,620 --> 03:18:39,453
The one that they see on tv where they 
roll up the garage door and you see her 

4686
03:18:41,701 --> 03:18:43,350
hitting the pads pop up and that's it.
Up.

4687
03:18:43,360 --> 03:18:44,030
Up,
up.

4688
03:18:44,030 --> 03:18:44,311
Yeah.
By,

4689
03:18:44,311 --> 03:18:46,320
by Matt please.
Good though.

4690
03:18:46,380 --> 03:18:48,430
It looks good doing that.
Very interesting man.

4691
03:18:50,260 --> 03:18:55,260
Who the fuck knows who the fuck knows?
I just know you're going to be watching.

4692
03:18:55,400 --> 03:18:56,520
Everyone's going to be watching.
Yeah.

4693
03:18:56,550 --> 03:19:00,190
That's going to be crazy man.
Crazy nuts going to be crazy.

4694
03:19:02,780 --> 03:19:04,690
I think it would be surprised by the 
ratings.

4695
03:19:05,140 --> 03:19:06,670
You don't think anybody is watching?
No,

4696
03:19:06,671 --> 03:19:08,630
I'm not saying that somebody haters.
No,

4697
03:19:08,660 --> 03:19:09,050
no,
no,

4698
03:19:09,050 --> 03:19:13,500
no,
no,

4699
03:19:14,750 --> 03:19:19,570
no.
I'm not a hater on the promotional game.

4700
03:19:19,571 --> 03:19:20,680
Stan.
I understand what you're saying.

4701
03:19:21,830 --> 03:19:22,663
I don't think you're gonna see the same 
numbers of the conor fight or is there 

4702
03:19:24,591 --> 03:19:27,730
any other books that are coming up that 
we should be aware of?

4703
03:19:27,760 --> 03:19:28,593
Any other big fights without what else 
is happening on the feature about Tony 

4704
03:19:32,140 --> 03:19:33,760
Khabib is that are going to have not 
happen.

4705
03:19:33,800 --> 03:19:34,633
Signed.
It's that you're talking about for the 

4706
03:19:35,531 --> 03:19:37,930
interim title.
I mean that's not happening easily wants

4707
03:19:37,931 --> 03:19:39,130
money,
but here's my question.

4708
03:19:39,131 --> 03:19:41,410
How the fuck do you have an interim 
champion that quick?

4709
03:19:42,130 --> 03:19:42,941
What is,
what's,

4710
03:19:42,941 --> 03:19:44,410
what's going on with that?
How do you,

4711
03:19:44,411 --> 03:19:45,244
what's what sells?
That's what gets people to tune in as 

4712
03:19:47,441 --> 03:19:48,550
belts.
Okay.

4713
03:19:48,820 --> 03:19:53,170
And so because of the fact that you're 
guaranteeing will also,

4714
03:19:53,200 --> 03:19:58,200
if you have a beep fight,
conor in Russia and Habib has the belt,

4715
03:19:59,680 --> 03:20:02,960
Jesus Christ,
we need to rush and destroy.

4716
03:20:03,560 --> 03:20:08,110
He is the Russian destroys the only one.
He is it.

4717
03:20:08,111 --> 03:20:11,890
He's on Rafi that he's a smasher.
But what a big opportunity for Tony,

4718
03:20:12,220 --> 03:20:13,810
if Tony Ferguson could steal that 
thunder.

4719
03:20:13,811 --> 03:20:16,270
And if you see when Michael Johnson 
clipped him and hurt him,

4720
03:20:16,271 --> 03:20:18,010
that was the first time we ever saw him.
Her true.

4721
03:20:18,400 --> 03:20:19,233
But Michael Johnson just does not have 
the same grappling ability of the Tony 

4722
03:20:22,200 --> 03:20:22,970
Ferguson has.
No,

4723
03:20:22,970 --> 03:20:23,803
it's a different animals.
And also Tony Ferguson is a different 

4724
03:20:26,891 --> 03:20:27,920
kind of stryker too.
He's,

4725
03:20:27,930 --> 03:20:31,300
he's much more awkward in his movement 
is like,

4726
03:20:31,420 --> 03:20:33,580
he's a real hard time.
Get what?

4727
03:20:33,581 --> 03:20:35,940
They're both real good.
Michael Johnson's a very good striker.

4728
03:20:35,941 --> 03:20:39,010
I mean when you knocked it knocked out 
dust employee that both real good.

4729
03:20:39,520 --> 03:20:42,090
But the big difference is the amount of 
grappling ability,

4730
03:20:42,100 --> 03:20:42,933
Tony's grappling abilities.
Did you see Tony's tweet or did he say 

4731
03:20:46,360 --> 03:20:48,280
he goes,
I'm down except the fight.

4732
03:20:48,281 --> 03:20:49,114
He goes off.
So he could be be you cause could be 

4733
03:20:50,291 --> 03:20:51,730
called them out.
Cause where's the fight?

4734
03:20:51,970 --> 03:20:53,320
And Tony,
Tony said,

4735
03:20:53,410 --> 03:20:54,243
dude,
you made your deal and you're making 

4736
03:20:55,241 --> 03:20:56,980
bank.
I'm not scared of anyone.

4737
03:20:57,010 --> 03:20:58,930
I just want to get paid what I'm worth,
man.

4738
03:20:58,990 --> 03:21:00,400
I'm down to take the fight.
Interesting.

4739
03:21:00,430 --> 03:21:02,300
I need to renegotiate my contract.
Interesting.

4740
03:21:02,620 --> 03:21:05,380
You know what Tony said in between round
one and round two,

4741
03:21:05,650 --> 03:21:08,380
you know he lost that first round.
Rafael Design Joe's,

4742
03:21:08,710 --> 03:21:09,543
he Atlanta took some good shots and you 
know we ran into the cage and you don't 

4743
03:21:14,861 --> 03:21:16,480
know exactly what's going on through his
head.

4744
03:21:16,500 --> 03:21:20,350
And he and his striking coach Anthony's 
like telling and some shit.

4745
03:21:20,650 --> 03:21:22,270
And before I got to say anything,
he looks at me,

4746
03:21:22,271 --> 03:21:23,380
goes,
coach,

4747
03:21:23,410 --> 03:21:26,380
I'm going to break his leg.
I'm going to kick the inside of it.

4748
03:21:26,770 --> 03:21:29,650
You know when he started getting it.
Okay,

4749
03:21:29,651 --> 03:21:30,880
perfect.
That's what I want to hear.

4750
03:21:30,881 --> 03:21:32,980
He's like,
he's such a barbarian.

4751
03:21:33,220 --> 03:21:35,740
That's what he had to say is,
I'm going to pose a monster.

4752
03:21:36,180 --> 03:21:39,790
So she kept beating DC Khabib looking at
Dana murking.

4753
03:21:39,791 --> 03:21:40,840
That dude gone,
oh,

4754
03:21:40,841 --> 03:21:44,230
Micah Johnson going on.
Give me a title shot man.

4755
03:21:44,231 --> 03:21:45,950
Just whooping his ass.
Gonna look different

4756
03:21:45,980 --> 03:21:46,813
on the ground.
It'll look different on the ground is a 

4757
03:21:49,370 --> 03:21:50,990
cubby.
Make no mistake about it.

4758
03:21:50,991 --> 03:21:54,830
He's a fucking bear on the ground.
The grappler,

4759
03:21:54,860 --> 03:21:58,030
but excellent.
Michael Johnson was making a lot of uh,

4760
03:21:58,550 --> 03:22:01,380
key errors on the ground.
Yeah,

4761
03:22:01,590 --> 03:22:02,380
he was,
uh,

4762
03:22:02,380 --> 03:22:04,730
he was [inaudible] to fix with that 
crucifix.

4763
03:22:04,731 --> 03:22:06,410
He was giving it to you was hurt.
He was hurt.

4764
03:22:06,440 --> 03:22:08,990
Did you see,
could be versus a dose Angeles though,

4765
03:22:09,050 --> 03:22:11,750
until just answers a legit black belt.
He mauled him.

4766
03:22:12,650 --> 03:22:14,000
He'll be mad.
Not to say that again.

4767
03:22:14,120 --> 03:22:17,870
Mocking mauled him on the ground molded 
me in a weird way where you watching him

4768
03:22:17,871 --> 03:22:20,780
just smush a guy who is a Brazilian Jiu 
Jitsu black belt.

4769
03:22:20,990 --> 03:22:24,830
Like he's handling it like a blue belt 
or a purple bag costing around.

4770
03:22:24,831 --> 03:22:25,664
Like,
I think he's grappling is as good as 

4771
03:22:26,631 --> 03:22:27,464
I've ever seen inside the octagon.
He might not be the same submission 

4772
03:22:29,841 --> 03:22:33,650
stylists that a Damien Maia is,
but it's pure ability to control guys,

4773
03:22:33,651 --> 03:22:35,690
take them down,
grapple them and maul them.

4774
03:22:35,810 --> 03:22:37,730
Is unprecedented.
Is MMA grappling.

4775
03:22:37,740 --> 03:22:38,571
I agree.
Look at this.

4776
03:22:38,571 --> 03:22:39,830
When he gets a hold of you,
it's,

4777
03:22:39,860 --> 03:22:43,460
it's so fucking undeniable,
like this kind of shit.

4778
03:22:43,820 --> 03:22:46,130
Like he gets a hold of you at bear hugs 
you and just like,

4779
03:22:46,131 --> 03:22:47,390
bitch,
you're going down,

4780
03:22:47,420 --> 03:22:51,740
you are going to the fucking ground and 
he holds you there and he beats the fuck

4781
03:22:51,741 --> 03:22:53,080
out of you when he has you there.
Well he's,

4782
03:22:53,090 --> 03:22:56,040
the rusher is insane.
Insane and positioning.

4783
03:22:56,270 --> 03:22:57,103
His positioning is pressure.
His strength is Damien Maia without the 

4784
03:23:02,031 --> 03:23:03,450
submissions and mortar.
Yeah.

4785
03:23:03,590 --> 03:23:05,390
Ground and pound.
Damien patrol,

4786
03:23:05,460 --> 03:23:08,240
but better take downs.
Better takedowns way better.

4787
03:23:08,280 --> 03:23:10,290
Yeah.
Mine's taking everyone down is very good

4788
03:23:10,291 --> 03:23:11,970
at one,
seven very wrestlers and everything.

4789
03:23:13,250 --> 03:23:14,720
No doubt about it.
But you've got to give the edge to,

4790
03:23:14,721 --> 03:23:16,880
they're gonna come in off and the 
takedowns yeah.

4791
03:23:17,330 --> 03:23:17,990
Yeah,
I think so.

4792
03:23:17,990 --> 03:23:22,010
I give the edge normally commit off over
everybody except Ben [inaudible].

4793
03:23:22,340 --> 03:23:23,173
Ben Asked her.
It was like the only guy that you just 

4794
03:23:24,321 --> 03:23:24,860
go,
okay,

4795
03:23:24,860 --> 03:23:26,700
what the fuck?
That's a fun fun.

4796
03:23:26,840 --> 03:23:28,860
Oh Bet dude.
Ben Asked Grin.

4797
03:23:28,910 --> 03:23:33,020
I feel like Ben's bigger,
but you know Ben is a 170 of course,

4798
03:23:33,320 --> 03:23:35,410
but he probably could make one 55 of the
fuck no,

4799
03:23:35,440 --> 03:23:36,273
they could could beep.
They do catch weight when 61 thing that 

4800
03:23:40,770 --> 03:23:43,600
[inaudible] didn't have the tone he's 
going to bring into this,

4801
03:23:43,601 --> 03:23:44,434
this college wrestling.
Tony is a really good rustler is going 

4802
03:23:46,731 --> 03:23:47,564
to be a lot harder to take tony down 
than it is dos Anjos tell he's just a 

4803
03:23:50,931 --> 03:23:51,810
different,
he's a,

4804
03:23:51,880 --> 03:23:52,713
he's like a harder mindset.
He's a scary fucking dude and more 

4805
03:23:56,271 --> 03:23:58,710
athletic.
Whether he wins or whether he loses.

4806
03:23:58,730 --> 03:24:01,250
Tony is a scary fucking guy to be in 
there with.

4807
03:24:01,670 --> 03:24:03,440
Very scary.
Not that Dosantos isn't,

4808
03:24:03,470 --> 03:24:06,710
but I think that Tony is like one notch 
scarier.

4809
03:24:07,010 --> 03:24:12,010
Remember this is dos Anjos like in his 
prime to prime.

4810
03:24:12,380 --> 03:24:13,213
Honestly it was,
this was before he started making his 

4811
03:24:15,111 --> 03:24:18,500
real serious run.
He got molly wop tier and then Habib got

4812
03:24:18,501 --> 03:24:19,334
injured and then they'll sign.
Just came back and he also started 

4813
03:24:20,961 --> 03:24:22,550
working with nick.
Curse on that was a big,

4814
03:24:22,640 --> 03:24:23,473
a big uh,
factor and his improvement cause his 

4815
03:24:25,351 --> 03:24:28,010
strength and conditioning got way better
after this fight cause he realized like,

4816
03:24:28,011 --> 03:24:28,844
Holy Shit,
I can't keep this fucking vanilla beast 

4817
03:24:32,901 --> 03:24:35,360
yeti thing.
His pressures,

4818
03:24:35,580 --> 03:24:37,760
pressures can rush Russian destroyer 
man.

4819
03:24:37,790 --> 03:24:40,310
There's just these Dagestan people,
man.

4820
03:24:40,340 --> 03:24:41,173
That heart,
that part of the world is tough and 

4821
03:24:43,230 --> 03:24:44,070
dudes are on

4822
03:24:44,070 --> 03:24:47,520
another level when it comes to like 
tenacity and aggression.

4823
03:24:47,550 --> 03:24:49,140
He's also been doing it since he's a 
kid.

4824
03:24:49,141 --> 03:24:50,700
He's a world champion.
You know,

4825
03:24:50,701 --> 03:24:53,700
Sambo that end.
Russians aren't regular white people.

[inaudible] versus Francisco Bueno.

4852
03:26:15,030 --> 03:26:17,160
Francisco Bueno.

4853
03:26:19,010 --> 03:26:19,710
And in the,
uh,

4854
03:26:19,710 --> 03:26:20,543
it's one of the,
like the most vicious chaos ever washed

You never seen this before.

4856

4858
03:26:26,641 --> 03:26:29,700
nine at the most and was fighting 
heavyweights and just,

4859
03:26:29,760 --> 03:26:32,580
he looked like a guy who had longer 
arms,

4860
03:26:32,581 --> 03:26:36,050
but they saw the ends off.
Do you remember ego hit the chancellor.

4861
03:26:38,020 --> 03:26:42,960
Is he before your time?
Before I got really Yo Dude,

03:26:45,360 --> 03:26:46,550

Oh yeah.

4864
03:26:46,551 --> 03:26:50,040
One of the scary dad bod look at the sky
size of his fucking thighs.

4865
03:26:50,041 --> 03:26:52,260
Dude.
Those were ridiculous thighs.

4866
03:26:52,530 --> 03:26:53,363
Like his whole body was just like,
like this compact just explosive 

4867
03:26:59,041 --> 03:27:01,320

What do you think are rising?

4868

4869
03:27:02,610 --> 03:27:03,690

03:27:03,960 --> 03:27:06,360

03:27:09,510 --> 03:27:11,870
We need a bunch of organizations like

4874
03:27:11,910 --> 03:27:13,710
Did you see he thinks back.
Yeah,

4875
03:27:13,740 --> 03:27:15,310

He's filling in for Shane.

4876
03:27:15,500 --> 03:27:18,420
I'm so sad the chains out,
but I'm happy to see that he is doing it

4877
03:27:18,421 --> 03:27:19,254
again.
And I saw pictures of him with Roy at a 

4878
03:27:22,420 --> 03:27:26,060

fight right there.
It's a real fight.

4888
03:27:45,260 --> 03:27:48,700
He's a little old,
but still such mma wise.

Powerful and not,

4929
03:29:10,571 --> 03:29:13,460

4935
03:29:23,400 --> 03:29:24,233
Oh Shit.
A lot of strong wrestlers come out of 

4936
03:29:25,800 --> 03:29:26,770
Iran,
you know,

4937
03:29:27,040 --> 03:29:27,850
iron,
sheik,

4938
03:29:27,850 --> 03:29:31,960
his things Greco,
which doesn't always translate to mma,

4939
03:29:31,961 --> 03:29:33,880
but who's more synonymous with 
wrestling?

4940
03:29:33,880 --> 03:29:35,440
And I ran in the iron sheik.
None.

4941
03:29:35,470 --> 03:29:40,100
Maybe.
Nobody ever did you ever see that?

4942
03:29:41,050 --> 03:29:45,310
I gave him a ride to the airport once 
and video tape and put it on Youtube.

4943
03:29:45,560 --> 03:29:46,990
I've never seen that.
No shake.

4944
03:29:47,000 --> 03:29:50,710
It's like seven parts iron,
sheik and Denny loaner where we're,

4945
03:29:50,711 --> 03:29:51,760
um,
cause he,

4946
03:29:51,761 --> 03:29:52,594
he,
his manager would take 'em you'd give 

4947
03:29:54,761 --> 03:29:55,594
him 200 bucks and you could hang out 
with the iron sheik and his hotel and 

4948
03:29:57,821 --> 03:30:00,380
just fucking shoot the shit with them.
And so Dan,

4949
03:30:00,381 --> 03:30:01,030
he says,
dude,

4950
03:30:01,030 --> 03:30:02,470
you want to go hang out with the iron 
sheik?

4951
03:30:02,471 --> 03:30:04,030
I said,
fuck yes.

4952
03:30:04,360 --> 03:30:06,460
So we went in,
it turns out we were late and he needed,

4953
03:30:06,461 --> 03:30:08,200
he was going to the airport in late.
He goes,

4954
03:30:08,230 --> 03:30:10,300
you want to,
you want to just take us to the airport?

4955
03:30:10,510 --> 03:30:11,343
And we're like,
AH,

4956
03:30:11,350 --> 03:30:13,240

We got him trapped in the car,

4957
03:30:13,860 --> 03:30:15,430
gets out mother fucker.
That's him there.

4958
03:30:16,000 --> 03:30:18,310
How old is he there?
He's a pretty old guy.

4959
03:30:18,311 --> 03:30:20,190
Holy Shit.
Wow.

4960
03:30:20,990 --> 03:30:21,581
Yeah.
He,

4961
03:30:21,581 --> 03:30:22,414
um,
he came on stage with me at that pot 

4962
03:30:24,790 --> 03:30:28,300
club in Toronto.
He came on stage,

4963
03:30:28,301 --> 03:30:30,130
he was in the audience and I brought him
up on stage.

4964
03:30:30,460 --> 03:30:31,293
You're damn right.
Joe Rogan knows what these toughest 

4965
03:30:34,391 --> 03:30:39,220
sport in all of Olympics,
freestyle Greco.

4966
03:30:49,120 --> 03:30:54,120
If people want to shop tonight.

4967
03:31:07,040 --> 03:31:10,040
Oh fuck yeah.
Everybody knows that the iron sheik is,

4968
03:31:10,520 --> 03:31:12,290
I showed him that I named a move after 
him.

4969
03:31:12,291 --> 03:31:13,730
I had my book with me and I go,
look,

4970
03:31:13,731 --> 03:31:15,350
I called the move the iron sheik.
Ah,

4971
03:31:15,380 --> 03:31:16,760
that's amazing.
He's,

4972
03:31:16,840 --> 03:31:17,673
he's hurting man.
His whole body's all fucked up from all 

4973
03:31:20,390 --> 03:31:22,850
those years of pro wrestling,
everything that too,

4974
03:31:22,851 --> 03:31:24,360
but I mean,
his knees are junk on.

4975
03:31:24,361 --> 03:31:25,730
His hips are gone back,
Scott.

4976
03:31:25,731 --> 03:31:27,560
And he's like,
go get fucked up man.

4977
03:31:27,561 --> 03:31:28,580
Fuck yeah,
they do,

4978
03:31:28,581 --> 03:31:29,414
man.
Nobody,

4979
03:31:29,510 --> 03:31:30,343
I don't think people appreciate the 
beating those guys take on their box or 

4980
03:31:32,801 --> 03:31:33,634
schedule though.
Obviously rehearsing all that stuff in 

4981
03:31:37,521 --> 03:31:38,354
reality behind the scenes.
He was the baddest dude and he was a 

4982
03:31:40,911 --> 03:31:41,830
real,
uh,

4983
03:31:41,860 --> 03:31:44,410
Olympia has an Olympic gold medal and 
restless.

4984
03:31:44,411 --> 03:31:48,590
So it was Kurt Angle and uh,
and backstage he was the fucking man.

4985
03:31:48,591 --> 03:31:50,810
Everybody knew that he was running the 
fucking show.

4986
03:31:51,050 --> 03:31:52,030
He,
well,

4987
03:31:52,040 --> 03:31:54,590
he was a definite like real wrestler.
Yeah,

4988
03:31:54,591 --> 03:31:55,350
for sure.
Yeah.

4989
03:31:55,350 --> 03:31:57,920
There's a few of those guys that get 
into pro wrestling.

4990
03:31:57,921 --> 03:31:58,754
They're like Kurt Angle,
but a real legitimate gold medalist and 

4991
03:32:01,121 --> 03:32:03,800
the shit went down.
They fuck you up for rail?

4992
03:32:04,450 --> 03:32:05,510
Yeah.
Well it's uh,

4993
03:32:05,560 --> 03:32:07,340
you know,
like how about brock?

4994
03:32:07,550 --> 03:32:08,720
I give this shit went down.
Who's,

4995
03:32:08,721 --> 03:32:10,280
who's beaten brock.
Good luck.

4996
03:32:10,910 --> 03:32:12,460
Good luck though.
You guys came Alaska.

4997
03:32:12,470 --> 03:32:13,100
I see.
Yeah.

4998
03:32:13,100 --> 03:32:15,560
Became cause they went to three people 
on the planet.

4999
03:32:15,690 --> 03:32:19,730
But yeah,
and also Kane at two 40.

5000
03:32:20,090 --> 03:32:22,280
You know when brock is at two 65,
when,

5001
03:32:22,310 --> 03:32:26,960
when brock is not under any sort of 
guidelines or restrictions,

5002
03:32:26,961 --> 03:32:29,270
he tends to be larger.
That's more con about it.

5003
03:32:29,271 --> 03:32:30,260
Yeah.
Wow.

5004
03:32:30,320 --> 03:32:31,580
Look at that.
The audio audience.

5005
03:32:31,581 --> 03:32:33,380
She Damn,
he was Jack.

5006
03:32:33,410 --> 03:32:34,243
Oh,
he was super jacked back in the day and 

5007
03:32:35,181 --> 03:32:36,570
powerful mustache.
Yeah,

5008
03:32:36,590 --> 03:32:37,880
he was a thick dude.

5009
03:32:37,910 --> 03:32:38,743
He also used to use those Iranian clubs.
Those look at the fucking swango other 

5010
03:32:42,060 --> 03:32:42,893
things.
We'll get the fucking thighs on that 

5011
03:32:44,151 --> 03:32:45,860
dude.
Jesus Christ.

5012
03:32:46,010 --> 03:32:48,640
I mean,
he's just like one thick mother.

5013
03:32:49,090 --> 03:32:52,370
Bleaks powerful,
thick ass.

5014
03:32:52,371 --> 03:32:54,170
Powerful dude.
But I'm watch,

5015
03:32:54,171 --> 03:32:56,340
see if you could find a Irenie.
I,

5016
03:32:56,350 --> 03:32:57,870
um,
um,

5017
03:32:58,580 --> 03:32:59,413
Indian club workout.
Have you seen the documentary on the 

5018
03:33:01,461 --> 03:33:02,540
iron sheik?
No.

5019
03:33:02,541 --> 03:33:03,374
There's a documentary on him and it just
got released like maybe a year or two 

5020
03:33:06,891 --> 03:33:08,690
ago.
He said it's awesome.

5021
03:33:08,720 --> 03:33:10,340
They're always sad though.
Like the Jake,

5022
03:33:10,341 --> 03:33:13,310
the snake one's a bummer.
See those clubs is a great,

5023
03:33:13,311 --> 03:33:16,780
it's a great documentary.
Sad though and Shit.

5024
03:33:16,790 --> 03:33:18,200
This whole story,
um,

5025
03:33:18,320 --> 03:33:19,240
you know,
it's not,

5026
03:33:19,330 --> 03:33:21,570
you're not going to start crying and he 
does this,

5027
03:33:21,571 --> 03:33:22,404
this is,
these clubs meet that check this shit 

5028
03:33:24,021 --> 03:33:25,280
out.
These clubs that he's using,

5029
03:33:25,281 --> 03:33:28,370
these are like traditional Indian clubs 
that they used to use to,

5030
03:33:28,430 --> 03:33:29,030
to work out.

5031
03:33:29,030 --> 03:33:33,470
They would do these things called shield
casts that is fucking very hard to hell.

5032
03:33:33,471 --> 03:33:35,000
Yeah.
And the way he's doing.

5033
03:33:35,010 --> 03:33:35,843
And he's like,
yeah,

5034
03:33:35,930 --> 03:33:36,763
yeah.
Those things around like they're 

5035
03:33:38,221 --> 03:33:39,054
nothing.
Those are fucking difficult to swing 

5036
03:33:40,801 --> 03:33:41,634
around.
And I do that work out with a 25 pound 

5037
03:33:44,041 --> 03:33:45,630
club.
It's that like,

5038
03:33:45,750 --> 03:33:47,840
it's that hard to do now.
He's a legit badness.

5039
03:33:47,870 --> 03:33:49,230
Yeah.
25 pounds.

5040
03:33:49,260 --> 03:33:52,050
Seems like it's nothing that like,
it seems like,

5041
03:33:52,230 --> 03:33:54,630
what the fuck is that though?
That he called them Persian clubs.

5042
03:33:54,631 --> 03:33:55,710
That's what we called it,
Hershey and clubs.

5043
03:33:55,711 --> 03:33:57,600
They,
well they used him in Persia as well and

5044
03:33:57,601 --> 03:33:58,201
uh,
I ran.

5045
03:33:58,201 --> 03:33:59,690
But the,
those were uh,

5046
03:33:59,940 --> 03:34:00,773
like an old school strength and 
conditioning piece of equipment and you 

5047
03:34:04,321 --> 03:34:06,720
would get other people to try to do it 
and they just couldn't do it.

5048
03:34:07,380 --> 03:34:10,200
Like some of them they would do matter 
would,

5049
03:34:10,350 --> 03:34:11,183
they would use like these big thick 
pieces of heavy wood with a handle on 

5050
03:34:13,741 --> 03:34:14,400
the bottom.

5051
03:34:14,400 --> 03:34:15,990
And that was what the originally are 
made out of.

5052
03:34:16,200 --> 03:34:19,140
But now a lot of guys make them out of 
steel now.

5053
03:34:19,210 --> 03:34:22,140
Like this Guy Jack White boy taking the 
challenge.

5054
03:34:22,380 --> 03:34:27,010
Oh he's doing it to Paul Paul.
Goddammit.

5055
03:34:27,030 --> 03:34:30,000
Precious Paul,
Precious Paul's going forward and back,

5056
03:34:30,001 --> 03:34:30,834
which is legit.
But the real way to do it is what's 

5057
03:34:32,430 --> 03:34:33,263
called a shield cast where you take your
right hand and you go towards your left 

5058
03:34:37,351 --> 03:34:40,170
shoulder behind your back and then you 
control,

5059
03:34:40,171 --> 03:34:41,760
you bring it down in front of you and 
control.

5060
03:34:41,761 --> 03:34:44,730
Do we have any of those here?
We don't have any of those.

5061
03:34:44,940 --> 03:34:46,980
We have the macy's,
but we don't have a club.

5062
03:34:48,340 --> 03:34:49,950
It's a fucking awesome exercise for 
stroke.

5063
03:34:49,980 --> 03:34:51,660
Shoulder strength.
Your shoulders,

5064
03:34:51,680 --> 03:34:52,880
beverly.
Yeah,

5065
03:34:52,930 --> 03:34:53,780
good.
What you do,

5066
03:34:53,781 --> 03:34:56,940
they can't go with like really heavy 
mates right off the bat,

5067
03:34:56,941 --> 03:34:59,010
but obviously precious Poe,
he's getting Jack now.

5068
03:35:00,240 --> 03:35:02,070
Seconds later he was like,
I do stupid.

5069
03:35:02,071 --> 03:35:07,071
Fuck whoever you ellis.
Chest precious pays us a man.

5070
03:35:08,130 --> 03:35:10,320
And just knowing that that iron sheik 
knows I'm alive.

5071
03:35:10,440 --> 03:35:11,520
I mean,
I mean it's pretty dope.

5072
03:35:12,030 --> 03:35:14,920
Can you still pay him $200 to chill and 
stuff for now?

5073
03:35:15,000 --> 03:35:17,130
400 bucks now.
Is it 405 now?

5074
03:35:17,160 --> 03:35:19,270
It's fine.
Fuck you.

5075
03:35:19,400 --> 03:35:20,460
Keep talking.
It's going to get more.

5076
03:35:20,660 --> 03:35:22,500
Yeah,
we put him in the car for like an hour.

5077
03:35:22,650 --> 03:35:25,560
It just picking his brain,
make them leave messages.

5078
03:35:27,690 --> 03:35:28,523
He was down.
He wasn't [inaudible] ride to the 

5079
03:35:32,851 --> 03:35:34,020
airport.
We see live,

5080
03:35:35,790 --> 03:35:36,623
I think somewhere in Minnesota,
maybe cold out there as fuck if you got 

5081
03:35:39,991 --> 03:35:42,180
a bad hip.
There's some wwe guys killing it.

5082
03:35:42,181 --> 03:35:44,700
Like Jesse Ventura's killing it.
He was a big time.

5083
03:35:45,420 --> 03:35:46,253
He's had some injuries to man.
A lot of those guys are all busted up 

5084
03:35:49,110 --> 03:35:49,943
from that dude.
Jesse Ventura is like 100% wheat 

5085
03:35:52,831 --> 03:35:54,840
activists now.
He just wrote a book on,

5086
03:35:55,010 --> 03:35:56,490
I had him on.
Oh Shit.

5087
03:35:56,550 --> 03:35:58,500
Yeah,
he was great.

5088
03:35:58,620 --> 03:36:03,620
He's all about the weed movement or some
shit and he uses weed for,

5089
03:36:05,340 --> 03:36:08,600
he's got a bunch of ailments and his 
wife has some ailments too,

5090
03:36:08,990 --> 03:36:10,560
you know,
and she's using weed for it.

5091
03:36:10,590 --> 03:36:11,423
You know,
he sued the American stamp guy and one 

5092
03:36:13,290 --> 03:36:14,160
American sniper.
Yeah.

5093
03:36:14,161 --> 03:36:15,310
Chris Kyle.
Cause calcs.

5094
03:36:15,311 --> 03:36:16,440
Crew.
Cal said he beat him up,

5095
03:36:16,441 --> 03:36:17,550
kind of punked him in a bar.

5096
03:36:17,940 --> 03:36:20,050
And he was like,
that fucking never happen.

5097
03:36:20,380 --> 03:36:21,213
And sued him.
Yeah,

5098
03:36:21,480 --> 03:36:22,313
he's um,
actually said he was going to consider 

5099
03:36:23,881 --> 03:36:25,620
running for president if Donald Trump 
won.

5100
03:36:25,621 --> 03:36:28,020
That's what he said on the podcast.
I wonder if he's still going to do it.

5101
03:36:28,650 --> 03:36:31,810
Talking to her seventies now.
He's in his seventies yeah.

5102
03:36:32,670 --> 03:36:34,140
And that's,
that's a hard,

5103
03:36:34,141 --> 03:36:35,720
just Donald Trump.
Yeah,

5104
03:36:35,730 --> 03:36:36,840
it's true.
Yeah.

5105
03:36:37,150 --> 03:36:38,680
It's all very interesting,
man.

5106
03:36:39,190 --> 03:36:41,110
All okay.
Any of the fights we need to talk about?

5107
03:36:41,170 --> 03:36:43,090
Is that it?
Did we get them all pulled up?

5108
03:36:43,750 --> 03:36:45,220
Brandon Thatch.
Oh,

5109
03:36:45,221 --> 03:36:48,370
who's he fighting isn't fun a while.
He's fighting up a price.

5110
03:36:49,900 --> 03:36:51,310
Who's Nico?
Nico Price.

5111
03:36:51,340 --> 03:36:52,630
Nico.
Nico Price.

5112
03:36:52,920 --> 03:36:55,180
How's that doing your,
you're friends with him,

5113
03:36:55,181 --> 03:36:55,631
right?
Yeah.

5114
03:36:55,631 --> 03:36:56,464
Friends with him.
I talked to at least or bowl and this 

5115
03:36:58,090 --> 03:36:58,923
morning about him,
he said it's the cause that just thing 

5116
03:37:00,221 --> 03:37:02,380
has always been dedication.
He sits the most dedicated.

5117
03:37:02,381 --> 03:37:03,400
He's ever been to a fight.

5118
03:37:03,430 --> 03:37:05,320
So that's usually scary.
Well,

5119
03:37:05,321 --> 03:37:06,910
he's a super,
super talented guy.

5120
03:37:06,940 --> 03:37:07,300
Great.

03:37:11,830 --> 03:37:12,611
What else?
Stunned.

5124
03:37:12,611 --> 03:37:14,140
Done verse Safa Dean.
But hold on,

5125
03:37:14,141 --> 03:37:17,590
let's look at this fucking fight.
Tammy's is a bad mother fucker and so is

5126
03:37:17,591 --> 03:37:19,300
all of era.
All the air is big though.

5127
03:37:19,301 --> 03:37:21,430
Didn't he have a hard time making one 70
in his last fight?

5128
03:37:21,460 --> 03:37:22,241
Yeah.
W was,

5129
03:37:22,241 --> 03:37:24,460
it was this last fight is when he got 
murked by cowboy.

5130
03:37:24,500 --> 03:37:28,020
The real cowboy because he goes by 
cowboy to know he,

5131
03:37:28,030 --> 03:37:29,720
I feel like he fought Alex.
Right.

5132
03:37:29,721 --> 03:37:31,000
And he won,
knocked the guy out,

5133
03:37:31,030 --> 03:37:33,190
but he was way overweight.
He's huge,

5134
03:37:33,250 --> 03:37:35,770
like way overweight.
Like for some reason he,

5135
03:37:36,070 --> 03:37:36,903
I mean,
I want to say he was several pounds 

5136
03:37:37,991 --> 03:37:38,824
overweight.
Right.

5137
03:37:38,980 --> 03:37:40,510
That's a fun fight.
Yeah.

5138
03:37:41,250 --> 03:37:43,150
Garcia versus Mike pyle.

5139
03:37:43,150 --> 03:37:46,360
Mike pile still hanging in.
God talked about can we,

5140
03:37:46,390 --> 03:37:47,223
he's the dirty bird.
He's a bad motherfucker to really 

5141
03:37:50,201 --> 03:37:51,034
skillful.
Very smart guy when it comes to is not 

5142
03:37:52,811 --> 03:37:54,190
young and then they are cute.
No,

5143
03:37:54,191 --> 03:37:55,024
he's in his forties but he's in the 
Larry Holmes forties and like a legit 

5144
03:37:57,641 --> 03:37:59,640
forties with Usada,
you know,

5145
03:37:59,660 --> 03:38:02,170
legit forties Terex,
half a dean and Don Young Kim.

5146
03:38:02,171 --> 03:38:04,150
That's interesting to them.
Guns been up for a minute.

5147
03:38:04,780 --> 03:38:06,850
Yup.
He has in him versus terrick.

5148
03:38:06,851 --> 03:38:10,840
Safa Dean is very interesting.
When was the last time stun gun was in?

5149
03:38:11,680 --> 03:38:13,750
When was the last time Dung Young Kim 
was fighting.

5150
03:38:13,990 --> 03:38:15,790
What was his last fight?
If you had to guess.

5151
03:38:16,150 --> 03:38:16,983
It wasn't the Woodley [inaudible] 
woodley stopped him probably because 

5152
03:38:19,571 --> 03:38:21,620
he's taken a long,
let's see what it does it say there.

5153
03:38:21,700 --> 03:38:24,280
Is it Woodley?
Nope.

5154
03:38:24,880 --> 03:38:25,990
Last fight.
He Won.

5155
03:38:25,991 --> 03:38:28,360
Who did he fight there?
Dominic water shit.

5156
03:38:28,420 --> 03:38:28,960
Ohh.
Burke.

5157
03:38:28,960 --> 03:38:31,180
Dominic waters and Josh Berkman.
Okay.

5158
03:38:31,181 --> 03:38:32,014
And then he lost to Woodley.
So he's still decay owed him two years 

5159
03:38:35,410 --> 03:38:37,450
since 2015.
Yeah.

5160
03:38:37,610 --> 03:38:39,300
Hmm.
John Hathaway,

5161
03:38:39,490 --> 03:38:40,323
what happened to him?
He was dealing with some injuries I 

5162
03:38:43,031 --> 03:38:45,180
think had a lot of potash.
Yeah.

5163
03:38:45,190 --> 03:38:46,023
A lot of attention and under uh,
under a appreciated grappling ability 

5164
03:38:51,161 --> 03:38:53,540
for a big guy from the UK.
English fellow.

5165
03:38:53,541 --> 03:38:55,510
That's right.
But he uh,

5166
03:38:55,540 --> 03:38:56,373
he had some injuries I believe.
And did he have like some sort of an 

5167
03:38:58,451 --> 03:39:01,390
allergy or something to like maybe a 
food allergy or something like that that

5168
03:39:01,391 --> 03:39:02,980
he was dealing with?
It's like,

5169
03:39:03,010 --> 03:39:03,843
no,
you don't see some kind of medical 

5170
03:39:06,821 --> 03:39:09,130
issue.
Something that's a bummer.

5171
03:39:09,640 --> 03:39:10,473
Yeah,
man.

5172
03:39:10,480 --> 03:39:12,500
Hard ass sport.
Um,

5173
03:39:12,520 --> 03:39:13,930
is that it?
Is that it for that card?

5174
03:39:13,960 --> 03:39:16,810
Anything else coming up that we need to 
talk about before we get the fuck up out

5175
03:39:16,811 --> 03:39:17,280
this bitch?

5176
03:39:17,280 --> 03:39:18,240
Sure.

5177
03:39:20,380 --> 03:39:23,050
How many articles do you think we wrote 
for the MMA media today?

5178
03:39:23,800 --> 03:39:25,870
A fake mma new site.
They need to stop.

5179
03:39:26,800 --> 03:39:28,450
They're all fake.
They have a lot of fake ones.

5180
03:39:28,990 --> 03:39:29,823
People make up shit.
I walked out and it's almost like a 

5181
03:39:31,301 --> 03:39:32,200
blur.
I don't remember.

5182
03:39:32,201 --> 03:39:33,650
I said I read some shit.
I'm like,

5183
03:39:34,600 --> 03:39:36,290
Oh damn.
I was just talking to my friends.

5184
03:39:36,320 --> 03:39:38,990
Oh you kidding me?
I never watched that shit.

5185
03:39:39,110 --> 03:39:39,943
All that shit though.
Those videos pop up like randomly I'm 

5186
03:39:41,541 --> 03:39:44,300
watching something else and that shit 
pops up and I'm like,

5187
03:39:44,301 --> 03:39:45,720
I don't want to watch that bullshit.
Well,

5188
03:39:45,790 --> 03:39:49,520
on my show I do fan questions.
Like when you said this shit to Rogan,

5189
03:39:49,521 --> 03:39:51,650
like I said that,
listen,

5190
03:39:52,310 --> 03:39:55,080
that's what that was a problem with.
Like people like getting upset.

5191
03:39:55,100 --> 03:39:56,810
It's something that people's three 
people say,

5192
03:39:56,990 --> 03:39:57,823
whether you're just,
we're all racing world's Darton in with 

5193
03:39:59,931 --> 03:40:03,200
shit and talking shit and we're all high
and were being ridiculous.

5194
03:40:03,350 --> 03:40:04,790
When you,
when you do stuff like that,

5195
03:40:04,850 --> 03:40:07,730
like you're going to say some shit that 
you probably shouldn't have said,

5196
03:40:08,180 --> 03:40:10,670
but you can't pretend that it is 
anything we thought out.

5197
03:40:10,850 --> 03:40:15,260
Like a lot of it is a completely off the
cuff and if you don't like that,

5198
03:40:15,261 --> 03:40:16,094
that's fine.

5199
03:40:16,190 --> 03:40:18,740
But if you do like it,
there's only one way to do it folks.

5200
03:40:18,930 --> 03:40:21,470
You've got to do it off the cuff like 
that and you gotta get a crack,

5201
03:40:21,471 --> 03:40:22,650
some eggs.
If you want to make an Omelet.

5202
03:40:22,670 --> 03:40:23,503
It's true.
We'll make some omelets [inaudible] 

5203
03:40:27,510 --> 03:40:28,580
stones all day.
By the way.

5204
03:40:28,581 --> 03:40:29,414
Brian counts not,
it's not that he's not here because we 

5205
03:40:30,621 --> 03:40:31,610
don't love him.
He's busy.

5206
03:40:31,700 --> 03:40:33,290
He's a on vacation.
That's all.

5207
03:40:33,291 --> 03:40:35,120
Cause people would go,
you go to cooking Kellen out?

5208
03:40:35,121 --> 03:40:36,140
No,
not at all.

5209
03:40:36,470 --> 03:40:37,303
But if he was here we would definitely 
have made fun of them and we definitely 

5210
03:40:39,551 --> 03:40:41,210
would have got called bullies.
So that's uh,

5211
03:40:41,530 --> 03:40:44,720
that's also made some facts up.
It's just what we do.

5212
03:40:44,721 --> 03:40:47,510
And we love him.
He's a crazy boy.

5213
03:40:47,800 --> 03:40:50,690
He's so fun fellow.
So he's out there on vacation.

5214
03:40:51,040 --> 03:40:52,520
He'll be back for the next one.
So,

5215
03:40:52,530 --> 03:40:54,470
uh,
we'll try to do one soon.

5216
03:40:54,530 --> 03:40:56,300
Um,
there's some other ones coming up,

5217
03:40:56,600 --> 03:40:57,890
um,
that I'm not doing,

5218
03:40:58,010 --> 03:41:00,230
you know,
I know for sure we'll have to do that.

5219
03:41:00,440 --> 03:41:02,780
And if a one saunders is coming up 
against,

5220
03:41:02,781 --> 03:41:03,990
um,
uh,

5221
03:41:04,020 --> 03:41:06,650
court mcgee,
then is that January 15th,

5222
03:41:06,651 --> 03:41:08,840
Sunday,
January 15th and Phoenix,

5223
03:41:09,860 --> 03:41:12,860
I'll be there cornering.
So that's the Bj Penn card.

5224
03:41:13,040 --> 03:41:14,030
What is it?
January what?

5225
03:41:14,031 --> 03:41:16,040
1415 oh,
it's a Sunday night.

5226
03:41:16,490 --> 03:41:17,201
Oh,

5227
03:41:17,201 --> 03:41:18,330

5229
03:41:19,150 --> 03:41:21,680
I was doing no conspiracy theories.
That one.

5230
03:41:22,210 --> 03:41:24,100
Next one.
I'll try and have them drive.

5231
03:41:24,160 --> 03:41:24,993
Brian saying,
why doesn't piece you just punch him 

5232
03:41:26,091 --> 03:41:27,170
with the right hand.
I'll tell you what,

5233
03:41:27,171 --> 03:41:29,000
Bj's fundamentals are just off.
Yeah.

5234
03:41:29,001 --> 03:41:30,200
What does it mean to just hit him with 
the right hand?

5235
03:41:31,190 --> 03:41:32,150
All right folks.
