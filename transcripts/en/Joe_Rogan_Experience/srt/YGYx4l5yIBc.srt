00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,940
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:04,020
I Dunno,

3
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:04,750
but I feel like,

4
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:07,670
remember when you told me that
story about the monkey that you had,

5
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:09,870
that you had when you were on fear factor.

6
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:11,570
Beat my ass.

7
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,090
That when you held that little thing you
thought this thing's made a word that

8
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,480
that's what I feel when I
get you up on my shoulder.

9
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:20,340
I'm like,

10
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:20,701
damn,

11
00:00:20,701 --> 00:00:21,780
this thing's made of wood.

12
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:24,090
Absolutely.

13
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,350
Start beep do.

14
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:27,630
I was telling Jamie,

15
00:00:27,631 --> 00:00:27,830
I've,

16
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:29,190
I think I've told you this story,

17
00:00:29,191 --> 00:00:32,790
I've probably told to everybody I've met
that I have a little baby champ on the

18
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,540
set of Newsradio like way back in the
day it was supposed to be in some stuff

19
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:37,374
that I tell you this,

20
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,213
I probably said it before.

21
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,490
This little motherfucker was on my back
and he hit me a couple of times and I

22
00:00:41,491 --> 00:00:42,390
was stunned.

23
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:43,170
I was like,

24
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:44,010
oh no,

25
00:00:44,011 --> 00:00:44,910
this is not what I thought.

26
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:45,700
It was like.

27
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,420
I thought it was like
a little person like,

28
00:00:47,421 --> 00:00:47,611
oh,

29
00:00:47,611 --> 00:00:49,230
this little person thinks he's a bad ass.

30
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,490
Let me just calm him down.

31
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:52,200
Now he got on top of HR,

32
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,700
just hit me a couple times.

33
00:00:53,701 --> 00:00:54,780
On the back and I was like,

34
00:00:54,781 --> 00:00:55,920
what in the fuck?

35
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:58,920
I just was thinking it immediately.

36
00:00:58,921 --> 00:01:02,430
I started doing the math in my head and
thinking what it would be like to be

37
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,200
confronted by a full grown chimp.

38
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:04,801
Okay,

39
00:01:04,801 --> 00:01:07,800
well that's my argument with
the silver back versus grizzly.

40
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,210
You said Grizzly because grizzlies or
even more and more of the fucking bad ass

41
00:01:12,211 --> 00:01:13,044
than a chimp.

42
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,233
Grizzly.

43
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,380
Grizzly can't like,

44
00:01:16,381 --> 00:01:18,060
there's no way a chimp
can outrun a grizzly.

45
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:18,840
There's no way.

46
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,680
Not a chance in hell.

47
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:20,543
What's this?

48
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,080
I don't know if that's true.

49
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,520
What is a silver back?

50
00:01:23,521 --> 00:01:24,354
Full speed.

51
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:26,170
I seen one of those things.

52
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,160
No grizzly can outrun a soda.

53
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:30,180
I know it.

54
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:30,660
I'm strong.

55
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:31,800
I feel confident.

56
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,550
I think chimps are faster than gorillas
and I think at grizzly can outrun a

57
00:01:35,551 --> 00:01:36,384
chimp.

58
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,530
And I sat for me,

59
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:40,260
I think there's no way the
guerrillas getting fucked.

60
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,710
He's getting D's,

61
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:42,220
dude.

62
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:43,740
I'm telling you right now,

63
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,820
big ass and tiering your hands
feel like when they shake mine.

64
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,253
So I would be,

65
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:50,880
I guess I'm not like a grizzly,

66
00:01:50,881 --> 00:01:52,590
but a giant dude

67
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,430
would crumple you like half empty pop.

68
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,110
It wouldn't even,

69
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:58,030
it would even be like,

70
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,070
you wouldn't even feel you.

71
00:01:59,071 --> 00:02:01,650
He would go through you
like whipped cream fee.

72
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,420
25 miles an hour.

73
00:02:03,421 --> 00:02:04,230
Top speed.

74
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:09,230
Why does it say feels like 25 feels late
in 25 similar animals speeds 34 but it

75
00:02:11,491 --> 00:02:13,560
feels like 25 I don't understand.

76
00:02:13,561 --> 00:02:16,050
What that means is from
someone riding it's back.

77
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,550
Get to a different website says,

78
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,850
is that really what this is?

79
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,681
Oh my God,

80
00:02:22,681 --> 00:02:23,431
I love the name.

81
00:02:23,431 --> 00:02:24,264
What PD?

82
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,170
Where'd that come from?

83
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,070
Do you know where that came from?

84
00:02:26,071 --> 00:02:28,170
For elk speed of animals.com

85
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:30,470
a walk.

86
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:30,900
PD?

87
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,231
Yeah.

88
00:02:31,231 --> 00:02:31,591
What does it,

89
00:02:31,591 --> 00:02:32,520
where does that word come?

90
00:02:32,521 --> 00:02:33,510
That's what an elk is.

91
00:02:33,511 --> 00:02:33,900
Dude,

92
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,260
I but I why?

93
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,890
It's actually a whopping [inaudible]
who called it the [inaudible].

94
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,370
What does that,

95
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:39,250
where does that name come from?

96
00:02:39,251 --> 00:02:40,084
I've heard it.

97
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,150
It's a cool name.

98
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,870
Wapa Wednesday is the Hashtag.

99
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:44,520
Cam uses it a lot.

100
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:45,661
Powerful.

101
00:02:45,661 --> 00:02:46,650
Wapa he Wednesday

102
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:50,220
champ.

103
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,420
I said a silver back.

104
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:54,600
I don't want to know is what
you think a champ is faster.

105
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,680
Jump off there.

106
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,530
Don't you think in chip
is faster than a gorilla?

107
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,470
[inaudible] silver back.

108
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,320
Okay.

109
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,810
Have you seen a silver back
come out of the fricking

110
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,430
told you so?

111
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:06,770
Yes.

112
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:07,603
What I'm thinking

113
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,840
it's just like an archery argument.

114
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:11,531
Yeah.

115
00:03:11,531 --> 00:03:11,951
Maybe.

116
00:03:11,951 --> 00:03:13,510
I think the bear gets a heavy arrow,

117
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,560
slower speed,

118
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,550
fast Arrow,

119
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:18,490
but there's not much of a
difference in the speed.

120
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:22,120
It's real close and a grizzly
bear is so much bigger.

121
00:03:22,121 --> 00:03:27,121
Moving so much more mass around like
have a big grizzly is 500 pounds a silver

122
00:03:27,771 --> 00:03:28,360
back.

123
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,290
I'm pretty sure.

124
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,550
I mean a big grizzly interior,

125
00:03:30,551 --> 00:03:30,970
grizzly,

126
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:31,803
what does a big one,

127
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,040
like 900 is that really not?

128
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,440
I'm not a mountain grizzly.

129
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:36,343
When you look it up,

130
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,420
the more aggressive ones just say
six or 700 and the really big ones,

131
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:41,171
the coastal ones,

132
00:03:41,171 --> 00:03:41,660
right,

133
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,700
which they call brown bears,

134
00:03:42,701 --> 00:03:43,534
first rounders.

135
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,590
Why do they call them that?

136
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:45,810
But because it's the same animal,

137
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:46,960
different specie,

138
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,033
is it?

139
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:48,970
Yes.

140
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:49,271
Yeah.

141
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:51,070
They're don't interbreed
or anything bigger.

142
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:51,930
The break,

143
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:53,360
there's just totally different bear.

144
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:53,591
Yeah.

145
00:03:53,591 --> 00:03:58,420
One looks like a Volkswagen with hair
and one looks more like a Ford truck.

146
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:03,070
It's one of those other things where
the the one that has the scary,

147
00:04:03,071 --> 00:04:05,770
your name is like not the biggest one,

148
00:04:05,771 --> 00:04:06,490
which is weird.

149
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:07,570
Like Brown bear sounded like,

150
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,530
oh he's so cuddly.

151
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,050
And Yeah,

152
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,970
those buses reac island,

153
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,740
they sell coke Klondike bars.

154
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:16,090
That's right.

155
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,230
What would you do for a Klondike Bar?

156
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,380
I fucking power because your buddy,

157
00:04:19,381 --> 00:04:20,214
I'm your buddy.

158
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:21,970
I live in a place where
there's no vegetables.

159
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,740
It's a conspiracy theory.

160
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:25,270
Told her bears brought that up.

161
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,840
They literally made those to
make themselves look cuddly.

162
00:04:28,841 --> 00:04:31,170
So humans would be stupid
enough to walk up to him.

163
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:33,250
Do you think it's like a nature trick?

164
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,160
Like nature made them cool to look at.

165
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,600
So we don't mind as much
that they're murderers.

166
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,330
I would argue Disney fucking Disney,

167
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:41,410
right?

168
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:45,820
Like that Bambi movie so
slower by 10 miles an hour.

169
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:47,523
The,

170
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,780
is there anyone that has
the doctor told you no.

171
00:04:49,781 --> 00:04:53,950
But is there any strength of a
silver back versus a grizzly?

172
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,590
And I say this saying,

173
00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:01,710
I really respect grizzly bears and
brown bears cause you know that well the

174
00:05:02,441 --> 00:05:05,400
concerns of a lot of grizzly bears and
brown bears that were listening to them

175
00:05:05,401 --> 00:05:06,240
and they were there,

176
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,273
they're pumped.

177
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,430
I think that um,

178
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:12,910
they're all dangerous and ferocious
and I'm thinking silver back versus the

179
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,590
nigger is you think you would win?

180
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:15,100
Yeah.

181
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:19,060
Maybe people will listen to this podcast
and he's put it in the Po in the posts.

182
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,920
What we need to know
what people want to know.

183
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:24,670
I wouldn't want to fight a 38 pound rat.

184
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:26,100
No.

185
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,390
Be fucking terrified to
fight at 38 pound rat.

186
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:33,540
So the idea of 38 I just cannot put a
number cause that's a fucking giant rat

187
00:05:33,581 --> 00:05:34,260
man.

188
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:34,570
Yeah,

189
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:36,550
but he should have said 30 40.

190
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:36,911
I know,

191
00:05:36,911 --> 00:05:37,920
but like 48

192
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:41,830
what's a house cat weigh like 10 pounds.

193
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:42,693
No Way.

194
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:44,900
That's the Garfield waste.

195
00:05:44,901 --> 00:05:45,460
10.

196
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:45,761
Okay.

197
00:05:45,761 --> 00:05:46,361
Like seven,

198
00:05:46,361 --> 00:05:46,991
seven pounds.

199
00:05:46,991 --> 00:05:47,410
I'm like that.

200
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:48,850
I would think something along those lines.

201
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:49,900
Okay.

202
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,350
Now,

203
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,310
now make it bigger.

204
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:52,750
Like keep it like a what?

205
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,480
What size is it becomes unmanageable.

206
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,320
First off,

207
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:56,960
let's,

208
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,030
if you're not wearing welding gloves,

209
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:02,630
a 10 pound in shape house cat,

210
00:06:02,631 --> 00:06:04,220
you're not talking like Garfield,

211
00:06:04,221 --> 00:06:05,270
you're talking like,

212
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:06,920
I dunno,

213
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:11,540
let's talk about a Conor Mcgregor
Garfield at coming in at 10,

214
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,940
like a real good tiger cat.

215
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,833
Like one of them,

216
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,621
you know those,

217
00:06:15,621 --> 00:06:19,060
those ones like real common house cat
ones to look like a little picture.

218
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,030
This pic,

219
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,460
if you grabbed a 10 pound mountain lion,

220
00:06:22,461 --> 00:06:24,450
do you think you can control that thing?

221
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:27,110
There's no way.

222
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:29,143
My neighbor,

223
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,040
my neighbor,

224
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,610
a 38 pound,

225
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:32,150
my neighbors,

226
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,530
good buddy of mine and he,

227
00:06:33,531 --> 00:06:33,830
uh,

228
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:38,060
he saw a mountain lion and
he saw a mountain lion when
they was walking his dog.

229
00:06:38,061 --> 00:06:39,530
It's got these little cutie dogs.

230
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,140
He's walking this little cutie
dogs and he saw this fucking thing,

231
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:43,880
so its tail and picked it up,

232
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:46,580
picked the dogs up and
ran back to his house.

233
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,280
And uh,

234
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,070
then mark got a website,

235
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:52,010
got on a website and found out that,

236
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:52,460
uh,

237
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:55,430
that they attract this
animal and that it a,

238
00:06:55,431 --> 00:06:57,230
it had a collar on it and uh,

239
00:06:57,231 --> 00:06:59,480
the tracked it and it got hit by a car.

240
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,750
On the five and he's
explaining like how the whole,

241
00:07:02,751 --> 00:07:04,250
the whole thing went down and I was like,

242
00:07:04,251 --> 00:07:04,701
Whoa,

243
00:07:04,701 --> 00:07:08,780
like that thing you were walking
your dogs and this big ass cat,

244
00:07:08,781 --> 00:07:10,640
it's was like 120 pound plus cat.

245
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,740
So the actual cat that had a collar,

246
00:07:12,741 --> 00:07:14,330
he knew that's the one he encountered.

247
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:14,660
Yeah.

248
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:14,930
Yeah.

249
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:15,440
He saw,

250
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,150
he saw the collar and then he went on
the website and you can track because he,

251
00:07:19,151 --> 00:07:22,910
he'd found out that this cat had died
and when he found out the cat died,

252
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:25,490
he went and uh oh the sound of whiskey.

253
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:26,500
Are you good?

254
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:26,660
Yeah,

255
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,493
I'm good dude.

256
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:28,160
Trust me,

257
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,840
you're Yeti's talking
a lot of stupid shit.

258
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:31,310
I never even touch that.

259
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,091
I definitely have.

260
00:07:32,091 --> 00:07:32,581
How dare you.

261
00:07:32,581 --> 00:07:34,160
Are you one of those guys bro?

262
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,300
We've been drunk cause me Bro,

263
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:36,403
quit bullying me.

264
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,333
Sorry.

265
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,650
That's my instinct.

266
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:39,800
What we were just,

267
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:40,660
what,

268
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,110
what the fuck was I just getting it to it?

269
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:42,973
I had on the rat.

270
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:43,710
Oh yeah.

271
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:44,660
Among other things.

272
00:07:44,661 --> 00:07:48,230
So a silver back is
essentially like a super,

273
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,300
a super prime it right.

274
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:51,111
The most super,

275
00:07:51,111 --> 00:07:51,711
super prime.

276
00:07:51,711 --> 00:07:52,520
Yes.

277
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:57,140
But a bear is one of the most super,

278
00:07:57,141 --> 00:08:00,830
Super Freak Predator animal freak out.

279
00:08:00,831 --> 00:08:02,090
Things like if a bear was little,

280
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:03,770
like a nine pound bear,

281
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,290
like the size of a nine pound
rat was trying to kill you,

282
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:08,880
you'd would be freaking the fuck
out if it was running annual,

283
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:10,640
like a little tiny bear,

284
00:08:10,641 --> 00:08:12,170
you'd be fucking terrified.

285
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:15,680
Now think of a giant one
and realize how PR you.

286
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:19,250
You are totally defenseless and I
don't think it's going to be that much

287
00:08:19,251 --> 00:08:24,251
difference for literally think of a
silver back gorilla with the way they're

288
00:08:24,681 --> 00:08:26,180
built and they swing around.

289
00:08:26,181 --> 00:08:30,410
I think if he stood on the chest of a
grizzly can grab its paws and literally

290
00:08:30,411 --> 00:08:32,180
rip its arms out and beat it with it.

291
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:33,650
Wow.

292
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:35,390
That's King Kong was a good movie.

293
00:08:35,391 --> 00:08:36,470
I agree with you there.

294
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,830
I enjoyed it as much as the next name,

295
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:39,890
I think in a Kong,

296
00:08:39,891 --> 00:08:40,880
but I believe that.

297
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,950
I don't think that's correct.

298
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,600
I don't think they're that strong.

299
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:45,051
The thumb,

300
00:08:45,051 --> 00:08:46,840
the thumb doves does give an advantage of,

301
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:47,031
right.

302
00:08:47,031 --> 00:08:47,864
It could grab,

303
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:48,680
wait,

304
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,550
it's a little smarter.

305
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:50,483
Yes,

306
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,800
Jamie Gray,

307
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,750
but he just,

308
00:08:53,751 --> 00:08:54,980
the bears way stronger,

309
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:55,853
way stronger,

310
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:56,580
way stronger.

311
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:59,040
It could smack at once in a while.

312
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:00,090
I've seen that.

313
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:05,350
I've seen or I've seen a grown mountain
grizzly hit a moose and Canada.

314
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:05,611
Yeah,

315
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:06,171
you told me that,

316
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:07,950
that I've seen you saw
it with your own eyes.

317
00:09:07,951 --> 00:09:08,784
Right.

318
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,350
Is there any solid information
of strength of a silver back for,

319
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:14,243
there's not,

320
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:16,950
there's just a lot of people that have
argued this on the Internet for the last

321
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:19,470
five to 10 we get dangerously
close to this argument.

322
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:20,131
Seriously.

323
00:09:20,131 --> 00:09:24,390
Why don't they put Thor's hammer
on the ground have and like put a,

324
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:28,590
put a Taco in it or something to where
a grizzly has to try to grab it and pull

325
00:09:28,591 --> 00:09:32,460
it off and have a sensor
versus the silver back down.

326
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:32,731
Well,

327
00:09:32,731 --> 00:09:35,970
the grizzly definitely can't grab as
hard cause it doesn't have thumbs like we

328
00:09:35,971 --> 00:09:36,511
talked about,

329
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,201
but I think,

330
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:37,411
yeah,

331
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:39,600
but that's relative to a beating,

332
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:40,830
right?

333
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:41,821
Who,

334
00:09:41,821 --> 00:09:46,821
how many fighters have a big
ass and a lot of like leg power,

335
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:51,480
cro cough versus someone
that's just sheer grill up top.

336
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:52,890
Let's do go there.

337
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:57,240
I just wonder how strong a gorilla really
is in comparison to which essentially

338
00:09:57,241 --> 00:09:58,590
like a giant dog.

339
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:01,530
I just think he's going
to get far you crazy.

340
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:06,790
You think silver back is equivalent to
a giant dog bear is what I'm saying is a

341
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:08,161
bear.

342
00:10:08,161 --> 00:10:10,070
A bear is like essentially
like a giant house,

343
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:13,730
but why would I call
it silver back put dog.
