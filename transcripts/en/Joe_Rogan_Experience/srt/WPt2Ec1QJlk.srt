1
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:06,070
Is that it?
And we really live.

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:07,450
Let's see.
Let's see if it works.

3
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,620
Boy,
does the Internet here sucks.

4
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:24,030
So high.
I know you are,

5
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,430
but you're also on the air.
So hold on.

6
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:33,450
I'm going to miss for this.
Hold on folks.

7
00:00:33,451 --> 00:00:37,910
I'm going to log in,
see the little spout,

8
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,650
these waters anywhere.
Well,

9
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,800
excellent.
This is the longest,

10
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,420
most unprofessional pause in the history
of my podcast career,

11
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:04,080
but I had to do it because uh,
uh,

12
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,320
Jamie's running the mic here,
so we're making sure that everything is 

13
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:09,320
going well.
It seems like we're live and online.

14
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:16,620
This episode of Joe Rogan Experience 
Podcast is brought to you by 

15
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:16,690
audible.com.
Uh,

16
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,200
if you've never been to audible,
they have thousands and thousands of 

17
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,070
audio books available for download and 
they have one thing that's really cool.

18
00:01:27,071 --> 00:01:32,071
It's a whisper sync,
a application for the kindle fire hd.

19
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:34,480
And what it is,
is the way it works,

20
00:01:34,481 --> 00:01:37,720
you're reading a book,
say you stopped on page 32 and you go to

21
00:01:37,721 --> 00:01:42,721
sleep,
but when you get up in the morning and 

22
00:01:42,721 --> 00:01:42,721
get in your car,
it syncs up to your cell phone.

23
00:01:42,721 --> 00:01:46,900
So it automatically starts an audio 
version of the book right where you left

24
00:01:46,901 --> 00:01:48,820
off.
That's a good idea.

25
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,640
So he says,
can you say that one more time?

26
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:55,170
There's Brian.
Katelyn.

27
00:01:55,190 --> 00:02:00,190
My pain.
There's an application called whisper 

28
00:02:00,371 --> 00:02:03,770
sync for in.
The way it works is when you,

29
00:02:03,771 --> 00:02:06,030
uh,
you have one of those Amazon kindle hds,

30
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,750
you those bad ass.
Okay.

31
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,480
Then you can use this when you're 
reading a book on it.

32
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:11,580
You,
if they,

33
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,640
if it has a companion audio book with 
this whisper singing allows you to sync 

34
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,700
it up to your smartphone.
So you have a smartphone,

35
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,310
iphone,
whenever you have syncs it up.

36
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:26,400
So then when you get in the car it 
starts playing audio companion to the 

37
00:02:27,071 --> 00:02:27,990
book you're reading.
That's,

38
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:30,700
I've always wanted that.
I read by a professional actor.

39
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:35,850
Yeah.
I listened to two competing versions 

40
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,030
though because listening to books a 
little bit different than reading it.

41
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,120
So you'd be getting parts that you 
listened to parts that you read?

42
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:41,240
Yeah,
yeah,

43
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:46,250
yeah.
It can be good unless the guy sucks at 

44
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,560
reading books.
Like you ever read A.

45
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:47,560
I

46
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:48,710
know,
but I would love it man.

47
00:02:48,711 --> 00:02:50,570
You burned through way more books.
Oh yeah.

48
00:02:50,571 --> 00:02:55,571
Wait,
because you don't want to start a new 

49
00:02:55,571 --> 00:02:56,851
one.
Sometimes you just want to keep doing 

50
00:02:56,851 --> 00:02:56,851
what you're doing

51
00:02:56,851 --> 00:02:56,851
and it makes use of time and you know,
in,

52
00:02:56,851 --> 00:02:59,750
in traffic,
and I listen books all the time.

53
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:05,130
If you're,
if you're one of those elliptical 

54
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:05,130
riders,
just get on that thing and yeah,

55
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:05,680
it's great.
What else?

56
00:03:05,681 --> 00:03:10,681
You got to a audible.
I do like it ca.

57
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,660
I think it's [inaudible] dot com forward
slash Joe.

58
00:03:16,661 --> 00:03:19,030
I should know this right?
Let's,

59
00:03:19,031 --> 00:03:21,100
uh,
let me see if I get it right.

60
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:26,540
Call a risk sync and doing that.
Dude.

61
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:28,900
It's the shit.
It's a,

62
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:30,700
it's beautiful.
I love audio books,

63
00:03:30,701 --> 00:03:33,520
but I love the fact that the two of them
tie in together.

64
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,760
I mean,
it's just such a brilliant idea.

65
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,990
A lot of stuff done today.
Have the Golden Globes on tape.

66
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:42,040
Don't know if they do all cry.
Um,

67
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,660
but anyway,
if you go there,

68
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:48,250
I will tell you,
but my internet is fucked here.

69
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:52,630
We're getting a,
a pipe drilled into this location.

70
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:57,820
We have to get a 100 megabyte video and 
audio of capable,

71
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:02,500
like constantly on fat pipe because the 
will we have is dsl.

72
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:07,590
It's fucking terrible.
We're like living in the stone ages 

73
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:07,590
here.
DSL.

74
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:12,020
Whenever GSA with new the hunting.
Hey,

75
00:04:12,021 --> 00:04:13,700
do you ever bring a.
You bring satellite clinic.

76
00:04:13,701 --> 00:04:14,380
That's right.
Yeah.

77
00:04:14,381 --> 00:04:15,210
We played.
Were talking about.

78
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,230
I wonder what kind of radiation I got 
from that.

79
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:18,880
Oh,
you'd probably be dead soon.

80
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:19,670
I've never heard of it.
Yeah,

81
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,530
they were here.
What's.

82
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:25,870
But the thing is no one would be able to
really afford to do that much damage to 

83
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:26,690
themselves on a satellite phone until 
the price comes down a little bit.

84
00:04:26,691 --> 00:04:31,691
It's true.
You get in a fight with your wife on 

85
00:04:31,691 --> 00:04:31,691
there.
You're looking at like,

86
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,310
you get a fight with your wife on a 
satellite.

87
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,980
It's expensive.
That's an expensive to fight.

88
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:41,110
You do not want to have that go to 
audible.com

89
00:04:41,111 --> 00:04:43,240
forward slash Joe.
And what I believe it is,

90
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:46,570
I believe you get one free audio book 
and a free month.

91
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:49,420
Uh,
I wish I could read it off the website,

92
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:54,720
but like I said,
this piece of Shit Internet is not 

93
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,450
letting us even open up webpages.
Jamie,

94
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,870
Jesus Christ.
We're not even uploading anything.

95
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:03,900
There it is.

I just keep Steven Rinella the gift 

101
00:05:20,311 --> 00:05:20,311
pack,

102
00:05:20,311 --> 00:05:22,560
I love that gift.
I thought his mind and my heart sank.

103
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:26,040
I should have done for you.
Got To be a president.

104
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,240
You have over to run our sweet friend 
taking me hunting it.

105
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:36,070
I get you some all the time.
You can have some too.

106
00:05:36,071 --> 00:05:40,750
It's just when that was the last packet.
It's Buffalo Jerky out of that one too.

107
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:45,890
What the.
We have this delicious Buffalo Jerky we 

108
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:49,381
sell now.
Do you know when I got into today for 

109
00:05:49,381 --> 00:05:49,381
the first time my,
my,

110
00:05:49,381 --> 00:05:53,010
my dear backstraps delays because I was 
eating all the damn leg meat and I was 

111
00:05:54,461 --> 00:05:54,780
like,
God,

112
00:05:54,781 --> 00:05:55,750
this is good.
This is good.

113
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:58,190
Those back straps.
Ridiculous.

114
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,870
You're eating all the Truman's first.
Yeah,

115
00:05:59,871 --> 00:06:04,871
that's what I was doing.
Most people eat all the favorite parts 

116
00:06:04,871 --> 00:06:05,580
and then they did that.
That backstrap is crazy good.

117
00:06:05,581 --> 00:06:10,581
It's good to work that way.
I was frying it up and butter and salt 

118
00:06:10,581 --> 00:06:10,581
to.
I would.

119
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,250
I would like to eat that forever.
Steve,

120
00:06:13,251 --> 00:06:16,010
how could you forget our bear meat?
You smoked bear meat.

121
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:18,830
You know what I'm telling you?
My wife had,

122
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,080
we have a baby that we had a baby a 
month ago and like I said,

123
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:24,320
I've been sleeping on the floor next to 
the bed and asleep bagging all night.

124
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:29,490
It's just like I'm like getting 
interrupted and I'm doing and I can't 

125
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:30,590
remember anything.
And last night at one point I'm like,

126
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:35,780
I know I'll forget the bear me.
I should go put the bear meat in my bag 

127
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:36,670
now family.
But that's,

128
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,800
you know,
when you started thinking about like 

129
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,990
ours without refrigeration and I just 
thought I'll just get up and to remember

130
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:43,150
it.

131
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:46,370
It's sitting there right now.
It was good to mad to the sample,

132
00:06:46,371 --> 00:06:49,040
slice off it really.
What's it taste like?

133
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,150
Taste like really?
Well,

134
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:53,420
just the way I did it.
He's like really dense ham,

135
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,440
you know,
but you sound like a pursued.

136
00:06:55,441 --> 00:06:56,030
Oh,
kind of thing.

137
00:06:56,031 --> 00:06:57,830
But darker.
Darker,

138
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,840
yeah.
Do you know when you say you smoke at 

139
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:02,840
that means you're not cooking it.
So I could get you a hot smoke it.

140
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,240
So I've Brian.
Oh,

141
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,210
okay.
For about a week.

142
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:09,270
And then tie it real tight,
you know,

143
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:12,410
is there a commercial version of this?
Can you get like,

144
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,330
no,
no one's done it,

145
00:07:14,331 --> 00:07:15,170
man.
No one's done it.

146
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,000
Um,
you know,

147
00:07:17,001 --> 00:07:22,001
there's so many.
Like when you get wild game in a 

148
00:07:22,001 --> 00:07:22,001
restaurant,
it's either imported,

149
00:07:22,001 --> 00:07:23,660
like come from Scotland and New Zealand 
and be deer.

150
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,400
But the domestic,
like the,

151
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:25,910
the.
I'm sorry,

152
00:07:25,911 --> 00:07:27,770
the,
the indigenous animals here,

153
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:31,250
you know,
people have done wild game versions,

154
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:32,870
like you can get elk or deer,
whatever.

155
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:37,880
But I think that the bear thing,
I've never heard of anybody trying to do

156
00:07:37,881 --> 00:07:39,170
commercially produced bearings of 
course.

157
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:40,960
So while you can't,
you know,

158
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:42,260
you can't sell wild game,
you gotTa,

159
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:46,460
you gotTa have it be inspected and 
produced in a controlled environment.

160
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:50,090
But I think that it would just be so 
expensive to put weight on a bear.

161
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:53,330
How gangster would it be if you were 
farming bears to eat them?

162
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:58,510
I don't have to do it would be illegal 
because one time I looked into like 

163
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:01,310
bear,
I had to say I wrote this article about 

164
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:01,630
eating a,
our oldest article goodbye.

165
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:06,640
I went to Vietnam and did a piece about 
eating dogs around the Tet holiday 

166
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:10,661
because it's like really auspicious to 
eat a dog in the last days of the lunar 

167
00:08:10,661 --> 00:08:11,020
year.
And when I was reading,

168
00:08:11,021 --> 00:08:16,021
yeah,
well I was writing my article and I had 

169
00:08:16,021 --> 00:08:16,021
this line in there and I'm like,
you know,

170
00:08:16,021 --> 00:08:18,290
of course it's illegal to sell dog meat 
in the US,

171
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,490
but in other,
you know,

172
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,530
some line like that and this fact 
checkers like,

173
00:08:21,531 --> 00:08:23,210
well how do you know,
like,

174
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,280
show me where you got that.

175
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,880
It's illegal to sell dog meat in the US.
I'm like,

176
00:08:28,881 --> 00:08:29,660
well,
I didn't.

177
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:30,740
I mean,
of course it is.

178
00:08:30,741 --> 00:08:32,440
You can't sell dog meat in the US is 
said,

179
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:33,920
well we need to see something you know,
you to have.

180
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:39,100
You got to back it up.
And I started looking into it in a real 

181
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:39,480
way and I called someone from,
uh,

182
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:44,620
the Usta and the other things.
And there's nothing matters to like 

183
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:45,140
California and New York.
It's illegal to sell dog meat.

184
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:47,570
It's like the only two states or someone
ever really pushed it.

185
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:52,840
In Michigan,
the rule is you can't sell dog meat 

186
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,400
unless it's property labeled.
And this guy from the Usta,

187
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,270
now this is a conversation I had with 
the guy from the Usda

188
00:08:56,270 --> 00:09:00,510
and he told me this,
you said within their guidelines,

189
00:09:00,511 --> 00:09:04,560
there's no reason you could not have an 
inspected dog production facility.

190
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:07,380
Of course someone's going to come out to
like the minute you did it,

191
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:09,690
you'd probably have tons of people 
coming after you for different reasons,

192
00:09:09,691 --> 00:09:13,710
but there's nothing per se that's like 
one cannot produce commercially produced

193
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,060
meat.

194
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:19,370
It's fascinating when we commit like 
that to like being really kind to one 

195
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:20,330
specific animal and that animal

196
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:22,600
domestic pets,
right?

197
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,900
Yeah.
Like the three horseplays,

198
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,920
you know,
there was three horses,

199
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,250
places that all got shut down some years
ago.

200
00:09:27,251 --> 00:09:28,880
Now.
I think they're opening one backup.

201
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,310
A lot of it's just,
a lot of it is.

202
00:09:30,311 --> 00:09:31,900
I think if you opened a,
you know,

203
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:34,820
dogs are very emotional for people,
you know,

204
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:38,740
if you do a movie and emotions and 
people were saying when he did,

205
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:40,060
uh,
that movie,

206
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:41,120
what's it called?
Um,

207
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:46,000
road trip and Jamie Robertson,
Junius spits on Zach's dog.

208
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:50,860
That was a big conversation because how 
do you get somebody who spits on a dog?

209
00:09:50,861 --> 00:09:53,120
How do you then kind of get them to be 
sympathetic?

210
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,480
And this all got an,
an awesome tangent.

211
00:09:55,481 --> 00:09:56,180
I got to finish this.

212
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,320
Well,
we get back around to it.

213
00:09:58,321 --> 00:10:00,280
I want to remember,
I want to talk about the media man.

214
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:01,430
Wolf mcquade.
Okay.

215
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:07,250
Awesome movie.
They told us everything until they kill 

216
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:07,450
his dog.
His dog is.

217
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:12,460
I know everybody's going to pay anyway.
Go to [inaudible] dot com and buy some 

218
00:10:12,691 --> 00:10:14,330
shit.
We got a lot of cool stuff.

219
00:10:14,331 --> 00:10:16,940
The end.
Use the rogue and save some money.

220
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:18,050
All right.
Hit The music.

221
00:10:18,051 --> 00:10:23,051
Let's see if we could do this Jamie.
Nice Joe Rogan experience podcast.

222
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:39,780
And it looks like everything is a go 
except the image.

223
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,640
Are you seeing the image?
Because all I'm seeing is that,

224
00:10:46,641 --> 00:10:48,140
uh,
the opening screen.

225
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,680
You see the image

226
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:53,000
second.

227
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,690
Oh,
is there like a big ass delay?

228
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,840
Very good.

229
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:03,040
Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo.
Do you see it online?

230
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:03,570
Because,
uh,

231
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:06,490
I don't see it online.
All I see is the opening screen.

232
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:13,450
It looks okay from here.
Check.

233
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,090
Hold on.
But

234
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,060
are you seeing it on ustream?
Because I knew streaming.

235
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:17,240
See it.
We'll figure this out.

236
00:11:17,241 --> 00:11:22,241
Ladies and gentlemen.
Brian has a new kind of aids that he 

237
00:11:22,241 --> 00:11:24,080
created himself in his own body.
So don't feel sorry for him.

238
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,820
Not You.
I'm talking about Brian,

239
00:11:25,821 --> 00:11:26,640
my employee.
Yes.

240
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,340
I don't know what happened to the poor 
boy.

241
00:11:28,341 --> 00:11:30,350
He's got got strep.
I guess apparently.

242
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:31,100
Did he?
Yeah,

243
00:11:31,101 --> 00:11:33,480
he's had it before he gets it.
Stress.

244
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,760
Poor guy.
Uh,

245
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,320
so uh,
he loved little buddy.

246
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,280
Um,
he's a,

247
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:39,080
he's hurting right now.
I can't even talk.

248
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:42,590
That's,
that's bad flu going around,

249
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,630
man.
All over the news.

250
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:46,100
I didn't get a flu shot.
Did you?

251
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:52,180
I figured you did.
I think I remember you telling me 

252
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:52,180
something like that.
Uh,

253
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:55,220
you know,
I think you have to keep your immune 

254
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:55,220
system strong thing.
It's very,

255
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:55,220
very important,
but

256
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:59,130
I'm not,
I don't necessarily know that they've 

257
00:11:59,130 --> 00:11:59,130
got that whole flu shot thing down.
You know,

258
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:02,200
there's a lot of talk that people 
actually get the flu because they take a

259
00:12:02,201 --> 00:12:07,201
flu shot of her.
People say that because apparently it 

260
00:12:07,201 --> 00:12:09,301
can make you sick or weak.
The CDC was saying 64 percent effective 

261
00:12:09,301 --> 00:12:09,790
this year.
Sixty four percent.

262
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,770
Really.
I mean,

263
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,290
I'm talking about a bunch of mugs.
They must take bunch of mugs,

264
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:15,950
give them the flu shot and then spit on 
them.

265
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:21,050
How a guy with the flu spit on him and 
64 percent of those guys didn't get the 

266
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:25,261
flu.
I'm completely talking out of my ass 

267
00:12:25,261 --> 00:12:25,261
because I don't,
I don't really.

268
00:12:25,261 --> 00:12:27,730
I mean I'm sure it does some good.
And especially maybe for some people,

269
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:30,340
maybe some people could use the boost of
a vaccination,

270
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:35,940
but I think that from what I've heard,
there's so many different strains and 

271
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:40,870
it's really hard for them to like to 
predict which strain is think.

272
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:44,050
I think they'd give you a,
an amalgam of different ones.

273
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:45,730
What they do.
Yeah.

274
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:48,520
But usually there's one strong,
very severe flu,

275
00:12:48,521 --> 00:12:51,010
whether it's swine flu or they are 
supposed to be particularly severe.

276
00:12:51,011 --> 00:12:56,011
So they'll,
I guess they inject you with a dead 

277
00:12:56,011 --> 00:12:58,891
version,
but it still give you a fever and stuff 

278
00:12:58,891 --> 00:12:59,110
because it's a new agent in your body 
and this and that.

279
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,660
Fuck that.
They all come from farms.

280
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:07,010
It's like almost all of them.
I liked the chicken flu or things 

281
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:09,520
jumping over from buying guns,
germs and steel.

282
00:13:09,521 --> 00:13:12,590
Jared diamond says agricultural status,
breezeway,

283
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:16,870
nastier germs because animals from the 
cow pox,

284
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:17,950
smallpox,
he said.

285
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,430
And the minute that that indigenous 
hunter gatherer tribes,

286
00:13:21,431 --> 00:13:23,230
because they were small,
always moving.

287
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,800
So and epidemics couldn't really build 
into those environments.

288
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:29,550
Usually you're Kinda kinda healthy being
at 100.

289
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:31,660
And that's why I like here in this 
continent,

290
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:34,270
like when they pass through the Arctic,
like Siberian stuff,

291
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:35,410
they came down and really clean.

292
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,850
That's right.
Because they leave there,

293
00:13:36,851 --> 00:13:39,790
they all say where they are and they 
move.

294
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:44,410
Whereas farmers live within their shit 
man.

295
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:49,150
So that's when they would come in.
He's these big agricultural societies,

296
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:52,440
not only they have systems of 
governments because they can be more and

297
00:13:52,441 --> 00:13:55,120
they could grow more because they grow 
their own food and stay in one place.

298
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,120
But they breed nasty germs,
man.

299
00:13:58,450 --> 00:13:59,890
In fact,
by some accounts,

300
00:13:59,891 --> 00:14:02,650
the native Americans,
by the time after Cortez came back,

301
00:14:02,651 --> 00:14:07,651
our Columbus Columbus came and they were
talking about huge populations of in the

302
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,490
Mississippi Delta and stuff.
You know more about this.

303
00:14:09,491 --> 00:14:14,491
And I do Stephen.
But then when they came back in 15 

304
00:14:14,491 --> 00:14:14,491
years,
nobody was there.

305
00:14:14,491 --> 00:14:16,150
It was literally did.
And they think that the talent are still

306
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:20,110
doing epidemic killed off 95 percent of 
Americans.

307
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,470
God Damn it.
But I had my flu shot though.

308
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:28,470
And I'll tell you why,
because we have like having that little 

309
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:28,790
baby.
Yeah.

310
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:34,020
What I mean,
like any little thing that like any 

311
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:34,020
paranoid thing I could say about having 
a flu shot,

312
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,630
like if you came home and gave.
Yeah,

313
00:14:35,631 --> 00:14:38,380
you don't want to do.
I mean like I'd rather have an increased

314
00:14:38,381 --> 00:14:40,600
chance of something weird happening to 
me then I don't think.

315
00:14:40,601 --> 00:14:41,960
I don't think you can give the food a 
little bit.

316
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:47,600
They had their mother's immune system 
and the breast milk is a real breast 

317
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,760
milk is pretty amazing.
So she probably got the flu shot through

318
00:14:48,761 --> 00:14:50,430
her mom anyway.
Yeah.

319
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,930
It's incredible.
How quickly

320
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:54,170
brings him back from colds and stuff 
like that.

321
00:14:54,171 --> 00:14:56,960
There's everything there.
Little Body needs in that.

322
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:59,810
That's really insane that your body 
makes food.

323
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:05,310
You know,
really when you see a woman's body 

324
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:05,310
produce food,
it's a trip.

325
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:06,380
It's like really hard to wrap your head 
around.

326
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:09,560
I had a buddy that would use it for 
coffee creamer and stuff.

327
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:10,880
Okay.
That guy's a freak.

328
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:15,260
I talked a lot about.
I talked a lot about drinks and I talked

329
00:15:15,261 --> 00:15:18,050
so much like for our first get talked so
much garbage,

330
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:18,520
but I was like,
oh,

331
00:15:18,521 --> 00:15:19,520
I'm gonna drink it.
And did it,

332
00:15:19,521 --> 00:15:21,380
uh,
and when the time came,

333
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:26,890
I'm going to tell you guys a story.
It's hard to get back to sucking on 

334
00:15:27,831 --> 00:15:29,510
those things too.
It's strange,

335
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:30,600
you know,
it's like,

336
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,210
once you think of them as,
oh,

337
00:15:32,211 --> 00:15:35,060
it makes it where the food comes back.
I mean for the,

338
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,640
where the food comes out for the baby 
and then all of a sudden you're like,

339
00:15:37,641 --> 00:15:42,200
yeah,
maybe a couple of strange.

340
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:43,410
It's like,
wait a minute,

341
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:48,410
what is that place exactly?
That's when a man becomes a man.

342
00:15:48,411 --> 00:15:51,680
When the first time he just takes,
you know,

343
00:15:51,681 --> 00:15:54,860
there's like a state of grace where it's
like for like six months,

344
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:57,770
at least after she stops breastfeeding,
you leave them alone.

345
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:01,010
But you can't mess with them during the 
breastfeeding phase.

346
00:16:01,011 --> 00:16:05,890
That's just rude.
It's creepy when you have children,

347
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:08,390
you see a woman goes through that.
You do look at women differently.

348
00:16:08,391 --> 00:16:09,140
That's for sure.
Like,

349
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,280
yeah,
that was my twenties,

350
00:16:10,281 --> 00:16:12,590
girls were,
they were soft boys.

351
00:16:12,591 --> 00:16:13,220
They were like,
oh,

352
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:13,920
look,
play.

353
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,560
I'll play with it.
How come you're not just like me?

354
00:16:15,561 --> 00:16:17,840
Why doesn't your mind like mine?
Why can I get along with you?

355
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,610
What do you mean you fell asleep during 
the raging bull.

356
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:21,960
Tell ranges.
Yeah.

357
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,020
How do you not like fighting and stuff.
You know,

358
00:16:24,021 --> 00:16:29,021
but I thought that's weird,
but then you realize a completely 

359
00:16:29,091 --> 00:16:31,850
different.
It's totally different species,

360
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:33,830
different species.
It's,

361
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:36,470
that's my,
my take has always been that we're never

362
00:16:36,471 --> 00:16:41,300
really the idea that we're gonna like 
somehow or another be able to understand

363
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,900
what it's like to be pregnant or do we 
even want to be pregnant?

364
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:47,300
The whole idea of being attracted to a 
guy,

365
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:50,010
it's like so alien to us.
For Steve.

366
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:53,210
We really told this earlier,
like guys that say like we're pregnant.

367
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:57,530
He goes,
yeah,

368
00:16:57,531 --> 00:16:58,850
you know,
my wife just had a baby.

369
00:16:58,851 --> 00:16:59,530
Right?
How was like,

370
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:03,620
that's the way to say it.
Don't be like we just had a baby.

371
00:17:03,621 --> 00:17:06,470
You didn't know we are pregnant is the 
worst.

372
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:11,090
That's the worst.
We just had a baby's okay because you're

373
00:17:11,091 --> 00:17:13,520
together.
I would say my wife just had a baby.

374
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:17,570
I might say we just had a baby.
I definitely wouldn't say we're pregnant

375
00:17:17,571 --> 00:17:19,070
though.
That's stupid.

376
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:25,530
It's supposed to be a solidarity thing 
or how about guys who have sympathetic 

377
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:29,440
with their breasts hurt?
It's a guy just given up as balls way 

378
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,230
too quick too to just ready.
He's ready to drop him off.

379
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:33,410
He's pulling on himself.
He stretched them out of themselves like

380
00:17:33,411 --> 00:17:36,050
where do you want to cut?
High and low dollar brother.

381
00:17:36,051 --> 00:17:38,300
Don't trust you.
You're not coming hunting with us.

382
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:40,370
Crafty Bitch.
We're pregnant.

383
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:41,480
Shut up.
Shut up.

384
00:17:41,481 --> 00:17:43,160
Stupid.
You'll cry when the shit hits the fan.

385
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:48,430
I know you will know your brain.
Shut up the dearest smelling your 

386
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:48,650
estrogen.
You will break under pressure,

387
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:49,750
bitch.
Okay.

388
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,890
You and your bitch tits.
You're gonna fucking sink this canoe.

389
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,300
Stupid.
Do you notice,

390
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:57,390
do you notice colors and fabric to.
Yeah.

391
00:17:57,391 --> 00:18:02,391
What is that?
When a dude will like try to Feng Shui 

392
00:18:02,391 --> 00:18:02,391
Your House.
Oh Man.

393
00:18:02,391 --> 00:18:05,811
You know what you really should do.
You should move all this over to here 

394
00:18:05,811 --> 00:18:05,860
and fuck.
Are you man.

395
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:12,080
If I go romance house,
I expect to see just fucking if the 

396
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:12,090
dudes single aspect,
chaos.

397
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:17,580
Total chaos.
I came to your house one time.

398
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:20,160
It's just like literally you were 28,
your house was.

399
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,890
He lived.
He was doing news radio and he lived way

400
00:18:22,891 --> 00:18:27,891
out in the middle of no where and and 
his house was so messier than mine and 

401
00:18:27,891 --> 00:18:29,250
mine is massive,
but there was just nothing was nothing.

402
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,700
No,
no,

403
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:32,410
no.
We'll use that.

404
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,400
I said,
I said,

405
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:34,860
well,
why don't you get a mate?

406
00:18:34,861 --> 00:18:39,861
He goes,
I don't want somebody to rummage around 

407
00:18:39,861 --> 00:18:39,861
rummaging around my stuff.

408
00:18:39,861 --> 00:18:42,580
This is my mess.
It was a fucking psycho.

409
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:45,340
Had never seen crazy,
was great,

410
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:51,500
couldn't take care of myself,
but that's how almost every one of my 

411
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,351
friend's houses are.
If I went over your place when you were 

412
00:18:54,351 --> 00:18:54,351
single,
it's the same shit.

413
00:18:54,351 --> 00:18:54,560
You didn't even have a door knob.
He didn't have a door.

414
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,420
I did.
It.

415
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,270
Didn't have a door knob.
I'm not bullshitting.

416
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:00,400
He had a place in Venice and he didn't 
have a fucking door knob.

417
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:03,420
Humans,
and one time while he did have a door.

418
00:19:03,421 --> 00:19:08,421
Now when you run into,
I literally didn't have a door knob and 

419
00:19:08,421 --> 00:19:08,550
people know what's going to break into 
my house telling the story about the.

420
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:12,150
And so one day he fucking wakes up and 
there's a homeless lady inside his house

421
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:15,300
cooking breakfast.
Literally,

422
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:16,500
literally like,
like cooking.

423
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,010
She goes,
you got to call it on.

424
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,080
I'm like,
what do you mean I gotta go on.

425
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:20,790
I'll actually,
it wasn't.

426
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:21,960
I didn't wake up.
I came in,

427
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:27,290
I came into my neighbors go,
there's a woman in your house cooking 

428
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:27,800
and I come in,
she's got a meal prepared,

429
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:29,490
she's got your pit bulls.
They're like,

430
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,380
hey man,
she was feeding my dogs.

431
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:34,500
Know you guys have children.
And she wasn't.

432
00:19:34,501 --> 00:19:39,501
Yeah,
unfortunately it wasn't that attractive 

433
00:19:39,501 --> 00:19:39,501
back then though.
Listen.

434
00:19:39,501 --> 00:19:41,460
But the being attractive wasn't really 
on the criteria.

435
00:19:41,461 --> 00:19:42,420
If you were a girl.
I was like,

436
00:19:42,421 --> 00:19:43,200
all right,
I'm in.

437
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:48,620
If you go to Ari Shaffir his house,
he tells me that sometimes he doesn't 

438
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:48,940
change the sheets for six months.
Skies,

439
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:51,230
dude in college.
Change my sheets.

440
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:55,850
Only one that changed girlfriend.
The only time I'd ever want.

441
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:56,870
I'd be like,
Oh yeah,

442
00:19:56,871 --> 00:20:01,871
that's probably why it's actually.
If you get used to living camping style 

443
00:20:01,871 --> 00:20:03,510
and you're hunting all the time like you
are.

444
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:08,930
Like in college,
we kept dishes in the sink for so long 

445
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:08,930
in college,
me and my two,

446
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:14,020
my two other roommates,
I swear to God that we had shit growing 

447
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:16,590
out of the drain.
We had sprouts in the drain.

448
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:20,550
We'd grown fucking sprouts show you that
thing that ruined my toilet.

449
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:25,700
They ever show you the thing that 
growing up there was apparently a crack 

450
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:29,570
in the pipe below my toilet and a route 
got in there and grew to this size of 

451
00:20:30,331 --> 00:20:33,240
like a Muskrat.
It was crazy.

452
00:20:33,241 --> 00:20:35,550
It was like this long and it was 
growing.

453
00:20:35,551 --> 00:20:38,610
It's like my toilet wouldn't flush or it
would drain really slowly.

454
00:20:38,611 --> 00:20:43,611
I couldn't figure what is.
It was an organism living off my shit 

455
00:20:43,611 --> 00:20:46,440
water and we literally live,
ring off my shit.

456
00:20:46,441 --> 00:20:48,040
Water and fat

457
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,580
and sick.
What?

458
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,380
It wasn't.
It wasn't going to animal,

459
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,020
but it wasn't.
It was a bark.

460
00:20:53,021 --> 00:20:56,140
A piece of pipe men.
Yeah.

461
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:59,020
The root grew roots are crazy,
man.

462
00:20:59,021 --> 00:21:04,021
They can grow through pipes and they can
see that some editing called route 

463
00:21:04,021 --> 00:21:04,660
killer.
Oh yeah.

464
00:21:04,661 --> 00:21:08,230
You forced on her toilet.
Somebody being like really?

465
00:21:08,231 --> 00:21:13,231
Like,
but I'm so fussy now and fastidious 

466
00:21:13,231 --> 00:21:14,260
about my home now because at a point 
like identify with your home,

467
00:21:14,261 --> 00:21:16,520
you know?
Yeah.

468
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,580
No,
I like everything.

469
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:22,680
Just like I'd be like lining stuff up,
man.

470
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:24,100
Yeah.
And you know,

471
00:21:24,101 --> 00:21:27,140
you're a father and you have children.
You don't mess.

472
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,780
I grew up in,
I grew up in a neat home.

473
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,260
Take a break and then you go.
Then you like,

474
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:33,260
act like your parents.
Kind of true.

475
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,680
Like I,
I kinda grew up like,

476
00:21:35,681 --> 00:21:38,530
I remember one day things had to be 
neat.

477
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:42,280
I got tired of the mess and things had 
to be ordered and,

478
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:47,330
and simple and clear.
I don't know what in the fuck that 

479
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:49,981
happened to me,
but I know it happened some one day I 

480
00:21:49,981 --> 00:21:49,981
was like,
just woke up.

481
00:21:49,981 --> 00:21:50,010
It's messy.
I need to.

482
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:51,910
I don't know.
I got tired of the message.

483
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:55,420
Maybe it's hormonal think so.
I don't know.

484
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:02,080
I just think it's smart.
It's smart to have a clean environment 

485
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,640
when your environment is clean and makes
you think better.

486
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:06,870
If you're completely cluttered.
That's exactly it.

487
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:10,030
Largely it's mental peace of mind when I
get up.

488
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:14,440
If I'm writing or whatever and I get up,
I can't write until the dishes and stuff

489
00:22:14,441 --> 00:22:17,110
are done really.
And in a way it's like a procrastination

490
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:17,490
thing,
know,

491
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:20,140
because it helps you put stuff off.
Like if you were really digital,

492
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:21,310
diligent,
really discipline,

493
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:24,160
you'd be able just to work through the 
mayhem,

494
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:25,060
you know,
for me,

495
00:22:25,061 --> 00:22:26,800
I got,
everything's got to be like Nice,

496
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,030
buttoned up,
you know,

497
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:30,190
Jj,
Jj Abrams,

498
00:22:30,191 --> 00:22:35,191
you know,
the guy has directed and written 

499
00:22:35,191 --> 00:22:35,600
everything created last to like every 
genius and I,

500
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,950
I just tested for to show up.

501
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:39,010
Greg Rung Burke,
who's Heroes,

502
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,900
he's uh,
he's his best friend since he was three.

503
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:45,790
And then Greg's a great guy and he said 
that when he pitches Jj Abrams and idea,

504
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:47,110
Jason Goes,
I don't want to hear it,

505
00:22:47,111 --> 00:22:48,010
write it.
And he goes,

506
00:22:48,011 --> 00:22:48,920
I know,
but I just want to hear if that,

507
00:22:48,921 --> 00:22:50,140
I don't want to end it now.
And he goes,

508
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:51,040
why are you doing?
And he goes,

509
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:54,580
the energy that you're using right now,
all the energy that you're excited about

510
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:55,790
should be in,
in,

511
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:57,340
you should be doing this with that 
energy.

512
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,870
Why are you not doing this with the 
entity?

513
00:22:58,871 --> 00:23:01,510
Why not writing that energy into the 
idea?

514
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:03,260
Because this is procrastination.
You.

515
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:06,010
You're waiting for my point of view.
That's procrastination.

516
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:08,140
It's kind of cool.
Like he wastes no time.

517
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:13,170
His all his energy is is that we use for
to worry or to think about other things.

518
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:19,890
It's in its.
It goes right into his channeled under 

519
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:24,290
that Jack Son of a bitch to step down 
and in the last season he talked to a 

520
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:31,110
pilot guy.
He dialed it in the last season I gave 

521
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:31,110
up on loss because of him.
Oh,

522
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,890
I didn't say it.
I didn't say it.

523
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:34,960
I've been obsessed with breaking bad 
man.

524
00:23:34,961 --> 00:23:37,960
I'm almost done with last for a 
brilliant.

525
00:23:37,961 --> 00:23:39,900
I'm just fucking around about the pilot.
If he's out there,

526
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:42,300
listen,
just.

527
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,770
It was one episode that was ridiculous.
I forget what it was like.

528
00:23:44,771 --> 00:23:46,310
They were by a puddle that brings

529
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:48,830
people back to life or something like 
that and he's just standing there like,

530
00:23:48,831 --> 00:23:53,480
what the fuck am I doing?
Because the last guy,

531
00:23:53,481 --> 00:23:57,860
like they went off the crazy train life 
and shit.

532
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:00,650
I've ever watched time traveling back 
and forth.

533
00:24:00,651 --> 00:24:01,550
I mean it was like,
all right,

534
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:04,400
where's the fucking polar bear man?
Whatever happened to those polar bears.

535
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:06,440
Where are those ended up being in 
purgatory,

536
00:24:06,441 --> 00:24:07,380
right?
Isn't that what the.

537
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:09,080
Didn't even stick around to the end.
I'm like,

538
00:24:09,081 --> 00:24:14,081
whatever the wind monster.
Remember the wind monster come and fuck 

539
00:24:14,081 --> 00:24:14,870
everything up.
So great show,

540
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,930
great show.
Wondering what was going on.

541
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:19,220
It must be so hard to do some blending 
that.

542
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:21,020
Do a show like that.
Just to create it.

543
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:24,740
Keep coming up with ideas.
She's just basically,

544
00:24:24,741 --> 00:24:25,910
you have to keep up.
You keep it.

545
00:24:25,911 --> 00:24:28,370
You have to keep surprising your 
audience for years.

546
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:33,430
It was a brilliant show for years,
like a brilliant show that really left 

547
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,510
you hanging on the edge of your seat.
I moved,

548
00:24:35,511 --> 00:24:40,511
I got onto it on the DVD form though,
so I got to watch like a whole shitload 

549
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,160
of.
Yeah,

550
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:47,280
it was awesome.
I watched like the first two seasons in 

551
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:47,280
a row,
you know,

552
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,230
so it was great.
And then you know,

553
00:24:48,231 --> 00:24:49,910
like you don't,
you don't get tortured.

554
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:50,830
I got to do that with home.

555
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:55,800
That like style a TV watch has changed 
in the TV experience in a way.

556
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:57,000
Do you think so?
Yeah.

557
00:24:57,001 --> 00:25:00,000
Because I think like just the idea of 
every,

558
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:02,490
you know,
of a cereal being like everyone has this

559
00:25:02,491 --> 00:25:06,030
cliffhanger element and there'd be like 
time to anticipate,

560
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,180
but now I think it's largely 
generational,

561
00:25:09,181 --> 00:25:11,760
but now you get turned onto something 
and you're like,

562
00:25:11,761 --> 00:25:12,480
well,
am I going to do that?

563
00:25:12,481 --> 00:25:15,390
I'll just go random and watched the 
whole thing all the way through.

564
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:21,150
It's just a way different experience and
kind of like watching a little bit and 

565
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:23,991
then for a week thinking about it and 
watching a little bit and I think you 

566
00:25:23,991 --> 00:25:23,991
burn out faster,
you know,

567
00:25:23,991 --> 00:25:28,610
every time I'd get into Charlotte and we
get interesting to show my wife and I 

568
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:31,091
will just go netflix that or rent or 
whatever and we and we burn out before 

569
00:25:31,091 --> 00:25:35,211
you would because it's not meant to be.
You're not supposed to sit there and 

570
00:25:35,211 --> 00:25:36,110
watch for half hours in a row or 
something

571
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,740
unless you're Joe Rogan.
Do you know what I mean?

572
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,080
Know you can do that.
You can watch it either.

573
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,130
Yeah,
I'm a,

574
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:46,160
I got a problem.
And then you get eight episodes in and 

575
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:46,160
you're like,
you know,

576
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,080
I'm over here.
I was supposed to play.

577
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:49,210
What are your favorite?
What?

578
00:25:49,211 --> 00:25:50,260
Do you have a favorite TV show?

579
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,510
Like?
Really?

580
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:55,840
I just don't take in a lot of.
I don't take insulin,

581
00:25:55,841 --> 00:25:58,340
a of TV,
but if the show I like,

582
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:02,000
I feel like they quit making them.
I watched.

583
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:06,050
I like curb your enthusiasm but I don't 
watch it.

584
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:10,850
It's don't you like comedies?
I like stuff that's so far.

585
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:16,420
I like some of this is so far removed 
from anything in my life or anything 

586
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:17,060
that I do or think about,
you know?

587
00:26:17,061 --> 00:26:22,061
And so it's just like a show like that.
You're like a comedy like that is funny 

588
00:26:22,061 --> 00:26:22,061
to me,
but I just don't.

589
00:26:22,061 --> 00:26:24,320
I just have never been that interested 
in watching TV shows.

590
00:26:24,321 --> 00:26:25,910
I don't know.
I like to watch movies a lot.

591
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:29,750
So now 10 more to watch.
I'll watch a lot of foreign movies.

592
00:26:29,751 --> 00:26:34,751
I don't know,
I just want stuff that's just coming at 

593
00:26:34,751 --> 00:26:34,751
me from way outside.

594
00:26:34,751 --> 00:26:36,730
There's so many good.
Like drama,

595
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:41,790
TV shows now there's so many shows that 
it's like breaking bad.

596
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:44,040
It's because it's so hard

597
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:47,550
to make movies right now.
Is that going into TV?

598
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:51,030
You're getting these like,
like that homeland show.

599
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:55,800
That's a fucking unbelievably good show.
I mean that is seen four episodes.

600
00:26:55,801 --> 00:26:58,190
I'm not going to watch breaking bad.
I'm on that too.

601
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,400
It gets better.
Gets it,

602
00:26:59,401 --> 00:27:02,040
keeps getting better.
The that shows incredible.

603
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:06,180
That's a good fucking show.
And it's like this is like a movie,

604
00:27:06,181 --> 00:27:11,181
you know,
like watching like this is like movie 

605
00:27:11,181 --> 00:27:13,281
quality.
Whereas before you were watching like 

606
00:27:13,281 --> 00:27:13,281
the $6,000,000
man,

607
00:27:13,281 --> 00:27:13,740
you know what I mean?
TV,

608
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:20,770
it was like filled with dog shit in the 
golden age of TV and so I really think 

609
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:20,770
so.
Yeah.

610
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:24,280
But the thing I always feel about tv 
when I watch and dramas,

611
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:30,400
I feel like I'm watching people.
Like oftentimes I feel like it's being 

612
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:34,421
written from an angle.
They don't really understand the world 

613
00:27:34,421 --> 00:27:36,840
they're writing about like a period 
piece type shit thing.

614
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:40,850
Like the Hbo Vampire Show where it's 
like,

615
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,850
it's like a bunch of dudes like 
imagining the south.

616
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:45,200
It's like,
I got it,

617
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,810
it'll be the,
Oh heck,

618
00:27:46,811 --> 00:27:51,811
you know what I mean?
And it just kind of to be like anything 

619
00:27:51,811 --> 00:27:51,811
you've ever.
And I don't know.

620
00:27:51,811 --> 00:27:51,811
Yeah,
I'm not,

621
00:27:51,811 --> 00:27:55,900
I don't know much about this,
but I know enough to know that it just 

622
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,110
feels like someone picturing what it 
would be like in their world.

623
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,030
Well,
the guy who created it,

624
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:00,100
I lived in the south.
I would have liked that

625
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,150
Paul was from the south and he was a gay
man in the south.

626
00:28:04,151 --> 00:28:07,560
And I think if you look,
if you watch trueblood vampires,

627
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:08,800
you know,
that's his experience.

628
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:09,700
It's,
I think,

629
00:28:09,701 --> 00:28:10,850
I don't mean to put.
I know Alex,

630
00:28:10,851 --> 00:28:15,851
I don't want to put words in his mouth,
but I think I think it's been a vampire 

631
00:28:15,851 --> 00:28:17,170
in the south,
like this take place is what it was.

632
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:20,590
It felt like to be gay when you were 
younger and it was a violent place,

633
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:25,600
like really can't be true,
but I think was a book or something like

634
00:28:26,201 --> 00:28:27,580
that.
But I think that at the end of the day,

635
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:32,320
if you can hear so you can see so much 
of what it was like to be gay as a young

636
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:34,850
boy growing up in the south,
you know,

637
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:40,740
just knowing that they can make a watch.
That's what I believe I saw thing and 

638
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,010
that's what made that shit.
No,

639
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:42,560
I didn't,
I didn't,

640
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,330
I didn't.
I wish I was like,

641
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:52,090
I'm going to do with gender,
gender analysis of the TV show.

642
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:56,470
I find it fascinating.
I've been,

643
00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:01,500
I've been really fixated on this lately.
How pussified movies and television and 

644
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:06,781
getting to the point where the vampires 
that we have to do not like vampires to 

645
00:29:07,561 --> 00:29:10,120
like they can be kind of your buddy,
you know,

646
00:29:10,121 --> 00:29:11,970
they can hang out with you.
Nine.

647
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:12,970
Oh two one.
Oh,

648
00:29:12,971 --> 00:29:14,470
with vampires man.
It's like why?

649
00:29:14,471 --> 00:29:19,471
But why Vampires?
Like why would you want to make like 

650
00:29:19,471 --> 00:29:22,111
this horrific monster and change its 
nature and tournament to this romantic 

651
00:29:22,111 --> 00:29:22,290
figure.
Like what did.

652
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:27,560
But my,
but my point is what I'm freaking out 

653
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:27,560
about it.
So like this whole trend,

654
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,500
like that Bourne movie,
you know,

655
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:32,050
that Bourne ultimatum or the fucking is 
the new dude.

656
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:37,330
No Dude,
it's pretty fucking bad ass Jeremy 

657
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:37,330
Renner.
He's bad ass.

658
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:40,440
He gets no posting and the whole moving 
saves.

659
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:42,910
Everybody girl's weeping.
She's all over him.

660
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,380
But there's never a kiss.

661
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:48,290
Never any desire on his part ever 
exhibited these,

662
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:52,250
even remotely attracted to these 
unbelievably hot women that he just keep

663
00:29:52,251 --> 00:29:57,251
saving and they're falling in love with 
him and he's just kinda like blank and 

664
00:29:57,251 --> 00:29:58,060
nonchalant.
Like what the fuck is the message?

665
00:29:58,061 --> 00:30:00,310
They're like,
are we becoming,

666
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:05,420
we want superheroes to be robot men 
there to service women and keep them 

667
00:30:05,861 --> 00:30:07,700
alive.
And that's like the,

668
00:30:07,701 --> 00:30:10,900
the ultimate goal.
But no sex at the end of the movie.

669
00:30:10,901 --> 00:30:14,770
There's sitting on a boat together,
throw it in a love interest.

670
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:17,100
Unless it was a loving,
wasn't luncheons clearly.

671
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,670
Yeah.
I mean he saving her.

672
00:30:18,671 --> 00:30:19,330
I mean,
you know,

673
00:30:19,331 --> 00:30:22,870
the idea is that he's not really a 
single and she's hot.

674
00:30:22,871 --> 00:30:23,710
I mean come on.
What do we.

675
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:28,730
Stupid.
We live in a really interesting 

676
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:32,071
observation though,
because if you actually think about it 

677
00:30:32,071 --> 00:30:32,140
like the TV shows I've seen even 
homeland and,

678
00:30:32,141 --> 00:30:33,240
and uh,
and,

679
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:36,190
and certainly breaking bad,
the sex is,

680
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,540
there is nonexistent.

681
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:38,650
They,
in fact,

682
00:30:38,651 --> 00:30:41,620
your heroes aren't even allowed to be 
lusty or any of that stuff.

683
00:30:41,621 --> 00:30:43,820
They're not allowed to be like,
holy fuck.

684
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:44,550
I don't know.
I,

685
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:46,720
I only saw the first five episodes,
so I don't know,

686
00:30:46,721 --> 00:30:50,530
but they get their goal,
but it's just interesting how that,

687
00:30:50,531 --> 00:30:51,970
that,
that I wonder if that's true.

688
00:30:51,971 --> 00:30:53,230
It sounds,
it sounds good.

689
00:30:53,231 --> 00:30:58,231
Anyway,
I just feel like there's some 

690
00:30:58,231 --> 00:30:58,231
pussification going on and on a giant 
scale.

691
00:30:58,231 --> 00:31:00,670
It's like this toning down of male 
energy.

692
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:05,700
Well,
look at fucking every show on NBC 

693
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,980
community.
All those guys have never done a pushup 

694
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:10,141
day.
It's all about being well that's okay 

695
00:31:10,141 --> 00:31:10,141
too.
I mean that's not what bothers me.

696
00:31:10,141 --> 00:31:13,600
What bothers me when I see like 
suppression of Mail Shit.

697
00:31:13,601 --> 00:31:18,601
Like I loved double o seven,
like the James Bond movies because he 

698
00:31:18,601 --> 00:31:22,800
still gets laid.
He's just a single secret agent out 

699
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,000
there killing and he's drinking and 
he's,

700
00:31:25,001 --> 00:31:26,050
uh,
you know,

701
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:29,020
women want to have sex with them.

702
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:30,340
Let's do this.
Okay.

703
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:35,440
I,
I enjoy a full superhero lifestyle 

704
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:35,460
movie.
I don't,

705
00:31:35,461 --> 00:31:40,461
I don't want a guy who,
for whatever reason is not sexually 

706
00:31:40,461 --> 00:31:41,170
attracted as chicky saving.
This guy's a sociopath.

707
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:46,200
He's a fucking psycho.
He's just out there kicking ass and he 

708
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,871
doesn't want to get laid.
You don't want them to be like monastic 

709
00:31:48,871 --> 00:31:48,871
to hill.
Yeah.

710
00:31:48,871 --> 00:31:49,990
You mean the beginning of the movie like
comes out of the water and he's like,

711
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,490
it's freezing cold,
but he's naked.

712
00:31:51,491 --> 00:31:54,930
He's not even fucking freaking out.
Not even shivering.

713
00:31:54,931 --> 00:31:57,180
It's just so powerful.
Shriveled up.

714
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:57,710
No,
no,

715
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:03,460
no.
But it's stoker road track Kyla in some 

716
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:06,901
ways as a reaction to the Victoria and 
the repressive Victorian age.

717
00:32:06,941 --> 00:32:11,941
So when Dracula would come and he'd be 
this big handsome guy and a girl was 

718
00:32:11,941 --> 00:32:13,060
sleeping and he would fight her neck and
drink or blood.

719
00:32:13,061 --> 00:32:18,061
It was very kind of.
The idea was she had an orgasm when she 

720
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:20,530
was being sucked dry is.
It was Kinda like a very taboo book when

721
00:32:20,531 --> 00:32:21,430
it came out.
It was very,

722
00:32:21,431 --> 00:32:24,820
it was kind of a,
a rebuttal to how repressively sexual,

723
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,860
uh,
the victorians were.

724
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:29,980
And Brahm Stoker wrote sort of that,
that reaction to it.

725
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:34,090
That's interesting.
I always thought it was just a fictional

726
00:32:34,091 --> 00:32:37,380
movie or book rather,
a written about a vampire.

727
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,890
Just an angry.
What was the connection between the Vlad

728
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:40,610
typists

729
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:45,230
because there was a vlad the impaler,
he was the original Count Dracula.

730
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:47,360
They say that the idea was,
was,

731
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:49,490
um,
based on this Hungarian,

732
00:32:49,491 --> 00:32:51,830
I think maybe a prince or a warlord or 
whatever,

733
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:55,340
who was an evil mother.
Probably a serial killer,

734
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:57,530
probably serial killer who,
you know,

735
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:02,600
did all kinds of horrible things.
He would cook pieces of people and eat 

736
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:02,600
it in front of them.
Yeah,

737
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:03,560
he would,
uh,

738
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:05,390
he would put people on stakes.
Just,

739
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,220
that's what they call him,
Vlad the impaler.

740
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:12,240
He would shove stakes up their ass and 
then let them slowly rive in pain and 

741
00:33:12,691 --> 00:33:15,060
just associate them.
He would leave them on,

742
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:15,620
on,
you know,

743
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:18,710
on these big pillars like all through 
the town.

744
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:24,040
He was an unbelievable evil guy.
All the depictions and images of him or 

745
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:27,140
him dining with like all these men on 
stakes,

746
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,790
like all around you about these things.

747
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:30,740
I think it was Ivan,
the terrible in Russia when,

748
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:31,670
when,
what?

749
00:33:31,671 --> 00:33:34,250
Whoever the artist was that did the 
winter palace.

750
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:36,500
I think it was the winter palace like 
this beautiful,

751
00:33:36,501 --> 00:33:37,820
like this,
this guy.

752
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:39,160
There was a lifetime of,
you know,

753
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,050
20 years of his.
It's like his opus,

754
00:33:42,051 --> 00:33:44,390
this great artists.
I mean if you look at it,

755
00:33:44,391 --> 00:33:46,310
it's I think,
I think it's out of the winter palace to

756
00:33:46,311 --> 00:33:51,311
her discharge this incredible church in 
Russia and when he was done with it and 

757
00:33:51,311 --> 00:33:53,510
he presented it to Ivan,
the terrible Ivan,

758
00:33:53,511 --> 00:33:55,880
the terrible was like this is the most 
incredible thing in the world.

759
00:33:55,881 --> 00:34:00,881
Thank you.
And then he took his eyes out so he 

760
00:34:00,881 --> 00:34:00,881
couldn't do it to anybody.
Oh Dude,

761
00:34:00,881 --> 00:34:02,630
this is a good point that you couldn't 
be like,

762
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:08,600
you could be a serial killer and just 
getting the exact right situation where 

763
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,670
you have a lot of power and just be able
to just do it,

764
00:34:10,671 --> 00:34:13,020
but it'd just be normal.

765
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:18,230
Do you remember that woman who's 
responsible for killing thousands that 

766
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:20,220
she was a noble woman and she,
uh,

767
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,500
was a serial killer of young women?
I,

768
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:27,530
I gotta,
I gotTa pull this up on wikipedia 

769
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:27,530
because it's a fucking fascinating 
stories.

770
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:28,220
This lady,
um,

771
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:30,470
but they say serial codes.
There's a book called the murder room,

772
00:34:30,471 --> 00:34:33,500
and the guy who specializes in sadism 
and serial killers,

773
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:38,740
he wrote what's called,
kind of like the double helix of the 

774
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:39,690
serial killers profile.
And he said that,

775
00:34:39,691 --> 00:34:44,691
that,
that a lot of serial killers will 

776
00:34:44,691 --> 00:34:44,691
definitely be.
I can't camera what the word was,

777
00:34:44,691 --> 00:34:46,580
but they become like,
they drink your blood,

778
00:34:46,581 --> 00:34:51,581
the lowest,
the lowest rung where you're the full 

779
00:34:51,581 --> 00:34:51,890
fledged boogeyman.
They eat flesh and drink blood.

780
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:55,530
Elisabeth bathory,
that's the crazy bitch out of.

781
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,670
And what did she do?
Killed.

782
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:01,790
She killed thousands of girls.
Who Was Hungarian?

783
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:03,380
Oh yeah,
she,

784
00:35:03,381 --> 00:35:06,350
they called it a blood count is 
apparently she,

785
00:35:06,351 --> 00:35:11,351
uh,
she just started killing chicks and 

786
00:35:11,351 --> 00:35:14,180
really got to love it.
And so it just torture them and killed 

787
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:14,210
them and find pretty girls just torture 
him and kill him,

788
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:17,120
which has killed thousands until they 
finally,

789
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:20,240
they,
they didn't even kill her in the end.

790
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:23,090
They,
they locked her in a room.

791
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:26,450
They gave her like a house imprisonment.
Like she was such.

792
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:29,720
She was a royal figures too.
So I mean,

793
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:32,240
Mr.
Crazy fucking shit man.

794
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:36,400
I mean that they didn't even kill her.
She killed thousands of checks.

795
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,040
They don't even know how many kills say,

796
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:42,480
like unbelievably evil.
They're out there.

797
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:43,770
But uh,
yeah.

798
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,680
Elizabeth bathory,
that's the chick's name.

799
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:52,310
A lot of times serial killers,
like I have a particular taste like 

800
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:55,190
that.
It's got to be a specific kind of 

801
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:55,190
person,
you know?

802
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:55,190
Yeah.
There's something,

803
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:59,630
something that snaps,
allows you to get a thrill off of 

804
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:03,891
killing a bunch of people.
And there's a weird thing that happens 

805
00:36:03,891 --> 00:36:06,171
to people with this whole royalty thing.
The idea of royalty is fascinating.

806
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:12,110
That's been killing me lately because I 
don't know how you guys feel about 

807
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:14,730
watching Americans get so gaga over the 
English royal drives me nuts.

808
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,860
It's so stupid.
It's bad enough.

809
00:36:16,861 --> 00:36:18,510
When the English student,
but what Americans do it.

810
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:22,230
Oh,
that's their version of Kim Kardashian.

811
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:24,500
It's the same fucking thing.
There's this.

812
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,240
Who are they?
What are their father?

813
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:32,530
Father met a count or do my duke.
He was a duke and and they were at 

814
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:34,140
dinner and somebody said,
what are you doing?

815
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:35,190
He said nothing.
Nothing at all.

816
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:39,930
Anyway,
it was so natural for.

817
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:42,220
I take a stipend from the English 
government anyway,

818
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:43,530
but you know,
nothing.

819
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:45,890
Of course I don't do anything.
I'm,

820
00:36:45,891 --> 00:36:48,810
I'm rolling and royalty.
They get paid.

821
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:52,390
They get paid the that I believe they 
get state policy.

822
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:53,600
You guys met,
you know,

823
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:58,630
Mo,
he think they get paid the shooter on a 

824
00:36:58,630 --> 00:36:58,630
show.
He,

825
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:00,400
he was present when he worked on Ali and
for some reason or another,

826
00:37:00,401 --> 00:37:05,401
I remember how it came up,
but he was like presented to one of the 

827
00:37:05,401 --> 00:37:07,050
British royalty and it was like a guy 
comes in and breaks down.

828
00:37:07,051 --> 00:37:08,010
Okay.
When he comes in,

829
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:09,750
don't do this.
Don't do that.

830
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,310
Put these gloves on.
Yeah.

831
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:13,430
Yeah.
Somebody said that to me.

832
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:14,240
I would be like,
no,

833
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:15,540
no thank you.
No,

834
00:37:15,541 --> 00:37:16,940
thank you.
Said you want,

835
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:22,700
in his defense,
he's like every like every part of you 

836
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,700
wants to just say like no way.

837
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:27,990
No way because you're part of this other
thing.

838
00:37:27,991 --> 00:37:32,370
Like you're there with a ritual and 
you're with people were at work.

839
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:35,130
You kind of like,
I could make like my statement,

840
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,620
like I could express my liberty,
you know,

841
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:41,610
and like my,
the fact that I'm not deferential at the

842
00:37:41,611 --> 00:37:45,330
expense of like all this other stuff 
that's going on and he's like in the end

843
00:37:45,331 --> 00:37:46,560
you just.
But it's like,

844
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:51,590
it's like,
it's like covering your head in a 

845
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:51,590
synagogue.
It's like covering your shoulders.

846
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:53,360
If you're a woman in Italian church 
there,

847
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:58,380
there becomes a,
there's a ritual and a protocol to 

848
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:01,071
everything.
But the things that traditional with 

849
00:38:01,071 --> 00:38:01,071
religion,
no,

850
00:38:01,071 --> 00:38:02,160
there's something much more.
It was like a much more deep seated,

851
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:07,880
but this is just strictly like I,
I'll honor you because you belong to 

852
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,360
some lineage.
I'm not really quite sure how it came to

853
00:38:09,361 --> 00:38:12,810
be and I'm not sure on the rules and 
regulations how it gets passed along.

854
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:15,870
But you were picking you to now be the 
one that were deferential through,

855
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:20,310
but it's actually a little cover on 
American,

856
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:26,570
very everything that we don't stand for 
will I get the fuck outta here with your

857
00:38:27,271 --> 00:38:28,920
crown.
But in Britain,

858
00:38:28,921 --> 00:38:33,921
in Britain,
they had what's called the great chain 

859
00:38:33,921 --> 00:38:33,921
of being.
It's very.

860
00:38:33,921 --> 00:38:37,221
It was very,
very central to sort of the British 

861
00:38:37,221 --> 00:38:37,221
history and character

862
00:38:37,221 --> 00:38:37,720
of the notion that the king,
the God was there,

863
00:38:37,721 --> 00:38:39,900
the king was bottom.
Then you had the aristocracy,

864
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:42,490
then you had no ability.
Then you had the merchant class,

865
00:38:42,491 --> 00:38:43,750
then you had,
you know the serfs.

866
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:46,280
Where does game of thrones fit in there?
Well,

867
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:49,870
you never stepped out of for many years.
That's why Britain was.

868
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:54,730
It benefited from the notion that they 
had very strong institutions and so when

869
00:38:54,731 --> 00:38:59,731
you had a royal,
a royal person that you came in contact 

870
00:38:59,731 --> 00:39:02,761
with,
it was very important to observe ritual 

871
00:39:02,761 --> 00:39:06,450
protocol and ritual sort of greeting and
interaction because it kept the wall 

872
00:39:07,271 --> 00:39:12,271
between you and and the royalty because 
the entire society with the benefit of 

873
00:39:12,311 --> 00:39:12,970
the royalty.
Well,

874
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:18,000
no,
but the but also the whole society was 

875
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:18,060
built on not only the,
the idea of,

876
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:23,280
of this caste system,
but also very central to the British 

877
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:27,361
character was that to esteem out of your
class was actually considered heretical.

878
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:33,100
It was considered a to the detriment of 
the entire community and society.

879
00:39:33,101 --> 00:39:38,101
Right.
Whereas Americans were like on thinking 

880
00:39:38,101 --> 00:39:38,640
about his climb and the fuck out of this
whole,

881
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:40,420
you know,
what's interesting,

882
00:39:40,421 --> 00:39:43,360
a lot of people that believe that a 
society like ours,

883
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:48,510
or at least how ours initially was born 
is only built in response to 

884
00:39:49,571 --> 00:39:54,571
suppression.
It's like you have to have a situation 

885
00:39:54,571 --> 00:39:56,020
like England where they're completely 
suppressing it to the point where you're

886
00:39:56,021 --> 00:39:59,800
willing to take such a great chance,
but you already have a semblance of idea

887
00:39:59,801 --> 00:40:03,310
of order and society,
which is based on their system of canes.

888
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:08,520
And that's the weirdest thing is it's 
almost like the only way for us to ever 

889
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,490
gotten to a position of power or 
position of,

890
00:40:09,491 --> 00:40:11,170
uh,
you know,

891
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:16,530
creating a culture,
creating civilization is that somebody 

892
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:19,831
had to take control and that ultimately 
we are these weird fucking Alpha Apes.

893
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:26,550
And we really want to be like led by 
like one person or one group or one 

894
00:40:27,011 --> 00:40:30,340
leader,
or at least have someone at the very top

895
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:32,800
that we can all agree to clap for.

896
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:38,280
And until we fill that goal,
then it becomes this wild fucking power 

897
00:40:39,761 --> 00:40:44,761
struggle.
It's like the only way we can work 

898
00:40:44,761 --> 00:40:44,761
together.
It's through one person.

899
00:40:44,761 --> 00:40:49,620
It almost seems like what's interesting 
though is the founding fathers had a 

900
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:52,471
rebuttal to that.
And George Washington and most famously 

901
00:40:52,471 --> 00:40:54,811
when they wanted to make him king said,
I am not only going to not be the king 

902
00:40:54,811 --> 00:40:58,920
because we don't have kings in this 
country where we have presidents that 

903
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:01,771
are part of a structure,
a structure that is directly responsible

904
00:41:02,231 --> 00:41:03,070
to the people.
Right?

905
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:03,900
But,
but,

906
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:05,170
um,
that,

907
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:07,240
that,
that was sort of the idea.

908
00:41:07,241 --> 00:41:12,241
And King George,
when he found out that Washington had 

909
00:41:12,241 --> 00:41:13,840
refused the kingship and instead went 
and fucking retired was like,

910
00:41:13,841 --> 00:41:16,540
that guy's the greatest guy of all the 
American character.

911
00:41:16,541 --> 00:41:18,340
That,
that was kind of sealed as.

912
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:20,440
That was the great example of George 
Washington did.

913
00:41:20,441 --> 00:41:24,070
He said,
don't ever call me king because that's.

914
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,390
That is exactly what we thought against 
sleazy.

915
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:29,350
The exact opposite of this guy who's 
running Egypt now,

916
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:32,670
who tried to turn himself into a king,
mostly most of them,

917
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:34,400
a little more sluggish and crazy.

918
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:36,910
It's so bewildering,
man.

919
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:39,260
It's so funny the way people act when 
you turn,

920
00:41:39,261 --> 00:41:40,580
when you turn the tide on,
man,

921
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:42,680
it's just amazing.
He's like,

922
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:47,770
oh,
now I understand what Mubarak was 

923
00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:47,770
fighting for.
Yeah,

924
00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:48,380
he's just this right here.
That's.

925
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:54,100
That's unfortunately a great deal.
That's the biggest challenge for the 

926
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:54,260
Arab nations is,
is,

927
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:59,340
is learning the benefits of democracy,
not get through that case system.

928
00:41:59,451 --> 00:42:04,451
They look at Molokai in Iraq,
we basically created a Saddam light 

929
00:42:04,451 --> 00:42:05,900
because Molokini now has his own police 
force.

930
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:08,720
The reports directly to him.
You know,

931
00:42:08,721 --> 00:42:13,721
he's still.
That's why the Sudanese are setting off 

932
00:42:13,721 --> 00:42:17,201
bombs.
There's still whether or not he can 

933
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:17,201
share power as a whole different story,
you know,

934
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:21,700
you know,
I get it with like watching the Arab 

935
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:21,700
spring stuff.
I mean,

936
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:22,030
I was always skeptical of it and one 
thing,

937
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,960
one way,
it was always kind of embarrassing,

938
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:27,500
like just understanding the history of 
some of those areas,

939
00:42:27,501 --> 00:42:32,060
the way Americans would so quickly 
forget our allegiances and so,

940
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:37,340
you know,
we're going against Qaddafi and like 

941
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:37,340
everybody's like,
yeah,

942
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:40,331
you know,
the number one us enemy could be like 

943
00:42:40,331 --> 00:42:40,331
for getting the.

944
00:42:40,331 --> 00:42:41,190
We were doing all kinds of things 
through there and you know,

945
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:43,640
and in some ways supporting Mubarak in 
some ways,

946
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:45,840
you know,
later on in some ways we support them in

947
00:42:45,841 --> 00:42:50,841
burke for 30 years and then so we gave 
$10 and eight every year and 3 billion 

948
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,390
year.
Yes,

949
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:57,180
every year.
But then this so quickly people.

950
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:02,440
But so quickly people wanted to make the
jump that like here's this logical 

951
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:02,440
enemy,
you know?

952
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:07,330
And that was frustrating a little bit.
But the main thing is when I was 

953
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:07,330
watching all that,
I wanted to be optimistic,

954
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:12,070
but I just feel like there's no way.
This is just going to be smooth 

955
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:14,921
transition and there's this,
there's this competing idea like when 

956
00:43:14,921 --> 00:43:18,671
you're an American who's like this 
competing idea we have between being 

957
00:43:18,671 --> 00:43:18,671
pragmatic,
you know,

958
00:43:18,671 --> 00:43:22,600
like we want these countries to be such 
and such way in order to secure our 

959
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,691
interests,
but also we had this thing where it's 

960
00:43:25,691 --> 00:43:27,711
like the only legitimate form of 
government is a democracy and as we're 

961
00:43:27,711 --> 00:43:28,040
going to find again and again and I'm 
definitely not.

962
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:33,640
No,
definitely not an expert on rural 

963
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:36,741
politics,
but we're finding again and again that 

964
00:43:36,741 --> 00:43:39,940
other countries being democracies isn't 
always going to serve our own national 

965
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:39,940
security interest.
You know,

966
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:43,010
I think that we want to think that it's 
like that dovetail and it's not gonna be

967
00:43:43,011 --> 00:43:48,011
that way.
Like maybe they're better off having 

968
00:43:48,011 --> 00:43:50,441
kings was depends on the actual actual 
people on the ground in those countries 

969
00:43:52,431 --> 00:43:52,790
is like,
yeah,

970
00:43:52,791 --> 00:43:55,040
I want to support democracy,
but then there's someone like,

971
00:43:55,070 --> 00:43:57,500
you know,
collect and you're like,

972
00:43:57,910 --> 00:44:00,200
that's not a democracy.
Democracy is voting for the guys.

973
00:44:00,201 --> 00:44:05,201
I like.
It just depends on how you define it 

974
00:44:05,201 --> 00:44:05,201
because one of the things,
we're already parker,

975
00:44:05,201 --> 00:44:05,630
I believe that's his name was,
is that British MP,

976
00:44:05,670 --> 00:44:08,130
a part of the parliament and he.
He's walked these.

977
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:10,260
He's walked every remote village in 
Afghanistan,

978
00:44:10,261 --> 00:44:14,180
every remote village in Africa,
and he said he'd never been anywhere,

979
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,030
any,
any room,

980
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:16,940
even the most remote village in 
Afghanistan.

981
00:44:16,941 --> 00:44:19,400
He never met anybody.
Anybody,

982
00:44:19,401 --> 00:44:22,340
no matter how strong their tribal notion
of the tribal systems,

983
00:44:22,341 --> 00:44:25,100
where he never met anybody who didn't 
want some say in who covered them,

984
00:44:26,190 --> 00:44:28,130
so that,
that that's.

985
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:32,100
That seems to be a human,
a need and a human right

986
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:37,100
and a human compulsion to,
to have some say in who fucking 

987
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:41,270
otherwise you get a guy like Ivan,
the terrible who just amassed this 

988
00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:41,270
power.
We all have a natural.

989
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:43,410
We all have a natural revulsion for 
that.

990
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:48,440
We all have a natural kind of.
I do think you're right that human 

991
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:51,501
beings need an alpha,
a leader and they always find the 

992
00:44:51,501 --> 00:44:54,291
leader,
but I also think at the same time they 

993
00:44:54,291 --> 00:44:56,301
want some say in that,
in that process and in the ongoing 

994
00:44:56,301 --> 00:44:58,650
process that is who governs them,
you know,

995
00:44:58,651 --> 00:45:01,440
and it really feels like,
like we talked about with kids,

996
00:45:01,441 --> 00:45:06,441
if you try to take a spoon out of the 
hand without explaining that you need 

997
00:45:06,441 --> 00:45:06,441
the spoon,
they,

998
00:45:06,441 --> 00:45:10,110
they,
they'll hold onto that fucking spoon 

999
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:12,290
and,
and human being seemed to have a 

1000
00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:13,350
resistance,
a natural resistance to those that would

1001
00:45:13,351 --> 00:45:14,370
have power over them.

1002
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:20,150
You know,
if you think you're going to be the 

1003
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:20,150
president and everything's going to be 
smooth sailing,

1004
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:25,340
you know how many haters you must have.
The moment I think that's probably half 

1005
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:28,911
the gray,
the gray is realizing how many fucking 

1006
00:45:28,911 --> 00:45:28,911
people hate you.
Sure.

1007
00:45:28,911 --> 00:45:31,270
Those guys age badly and mean.
It can't just be this.

1008
00:45:31,350 --> 00:45:36,350
You make one choice,
you're going to make 50 percent of the 

1009
00:45:36,350 --> 00:45:36,350
people happy and 50 percent of the other
people,

1010
00:45:36,350 --> 00:45:38,670
the way they got it carved out,
that's 51 percent.

1011
00:45:38,671 --> 00:45:40,980
It's like they got to carve down to 50 
point one percent,

1012
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:46,030
you know,
they're going to find books about you 

1013
00:45:46,030 --> 00:45:48,891
and how much we give Egypt.
Every year they're going to write books 

1014
00:45:48,891 --> 00:45:49,710
about you.
They're going to make up lies about you.

1015
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:53,760
They're going to constantly,
every person on the opposite side of the

1016
00:45:53,761 --> 00:45:55,770
fence,
whether it be Democrat on your side,

1017
00:45:55,771 --> 00:46:00,771
repo,
whoever's on the other team they're 

1018
00:46:00,771 --> 00:46:00,771
going after,
whatever.

1019
00:46:00,771 --> 00:46:05,300
No one ever does it,
and then no one ever does it for four 

1020
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:05,300
years.
Has maybe they have,

1021
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:06,260
if they would ever done it for four 
years and just said,

1022
00:46:06,270 --> 00:46:07,320
you know,
it wasn't for me.

1023
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:08,230
No,
no,

1024
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:11,040
not enjoy something like,
as much as I hate this,

1025
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:16,200
I'm going to keep doing this.
I also think that whoever got you into 

1026
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:16,200
that position of power,
you will,

1027
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:20,890
you owe them this obligation.
I always think about what George Bush 

1028
00:46:20,890 --> 00:46:20,890
said about her,
uh,

1029
00:46:20,890 --> 00:46:22,440
Hurricane Katrina.
They were like,

1030
00:46:22,441 --> 00:46:25,110
you didn't go down to New Orleans for 
five days or whatever.

1031
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:26,520
And then he said,
well,

1032
00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:29,520
here's the problem with me going out in 
New Orleans during that crisis,

1033
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:34,300
if I go down to New Orleans,
I got to take 60 police cars and and,

1034
00:46:34,330 --> 00:46:39,330
and the resources of the city to protect
me and to escort me to the damage sites.

1035
00:46:39,841 --> 00:46:42,720
It costs a million dollars an hour when 
you tie up a helicopter,

1036
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:48,180
helicopter type of all the rescue,
all the stuff that should be given to 

1037
00:46:48,721 --> 00:46:50,340
the people on the ground at that time.

1038
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:55,340
And he said that was the catch 22.
I was going to get criticized if I land 

1039
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:59,391
air force one the day before.
And that's one of the examples of being 

1040
00:46:59,391 --> 00:47:03,861
a president and you were always the idea
that you have to physically be in an 

1041
00:47:04,111 --> 00:47:09,111
area in order to observe or to respect 
the fact that a tragic incident is took 

1042
00:47:09,111 --> 00:47:10,320
places,
observed its pageantry man,

1043
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:12,870
because it's like you're playing a 
psychological game.

1044
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,260
I would always hand it to someone if you
could,

1045
00:47:16,290 --> 00:47:18,360
if you could make that point.
But people are like,

1046
00:47:18,361 --> 00:47:20,310
people are so addicted to the pageantry 
of it.

1047
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:21,510
They'd be like,
Oh yeah,

1048
00:47:21,511 --> 00:47:25,920
in order for us to recover from this,
I need to fly around in a helicopter and

1049
00:47:25,921 --> 00:47:29,100
have a governor show me that it's 
flooded because I'm not going to believe

1050
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:30,190
it.
You know?

1051
00:47:30,410 --> 00:47:30,850
Be Like,
oh,

1052
00:47:30,851 --> 00:47:35,851
you're right.
It is a visitors come to visit us 

1053
00:47:36,161 --> 00:47:37,930
pageant trees at great word.
By the way,

1054
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:40,810
I love the joke that Jeff Ross got up 
from the standard.

1055
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:44,680
We did this a charity and after 
Hurricane Katrina and he goes,

1056
00:47:44,681 --> 00:47:48,060
I went down there.
It's not that bad.

1057
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:49,630
Oh,
no,

1058
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:52,780
fucking terrible.
But the way he said it was,

1059
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:54,580
no,
it's so ridiculous.

1060
00:47:54,581 --> 00:47:55,720
Like that was his job.
He goes,

1061
00:47:55,721 --> 00:47:59,860
I don't see what the big deal lips.
No,

1062
00:47:59,950 --> 00:48:00,790
he was kidding.
I used,

1063
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:06,150
there's a.
there's going to be a higher incidence 

1064
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:07,390
of those fucking gigantic.
One hundred year storm is going to be.

1065
00:48:07,391 --> 00:48:08,400
There already is,
man,

1066
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:13,640
there's going to be even higher because 
we're together and I was supposed to go 

1067
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:14,710
to Texas and I flew home.
I flew home for that thing,

1068
00:48:14,770 --> 00:48:15,730
for the,
for the.

1069
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:19,610
That was sandy.
Sandy said I wasn't.

1070
00:48:19,611 --> 00:48:20,140
Yeah,
I was in.

1071
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:25,200
I was like,
I went home to be with my family and I 

1072
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,170
was there and if you like,
if you were in my place you would and 

1073
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:32,920
you didn't have the news or anything,
you would adjust that mic a little windy

1074
00:48:32,921 --> 00:48:35,880
last night,
like a mile away or not even a mile,

1075
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:40,900
a half mile away.
Cars like floating down the streets and 

1076
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:40,900
stuff.
But it was so crazy.

1077
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:42,670
It was just like,
well no,

1078
00:48:42,671 --> 00:48:45,490
it just like,
because it was so much the storm search.

1079
00:48:45,530 --> 00:48:47,170
Right.
Don't mean like if you were,

1080
00:48:47,171 --> 00:48:50,130
if you got above a certain elevation,
you know,

1081
00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:51,070
you were fine.
It was just,

1082
00:48:51,130 --> 00:48:56,130
he would never have ever have known.
It was like there was a few more leaves 

1083
00:48:56,130 --> 00:49:00,211
on the sidewalk,
but then just wow some short distance 

1084
00:49:00,211 --> 00:49:02,881
down.
Like you dropped to a certain elevation 

1085
00:49:02,881 --> 00:49:02,980
point.
Absolute may have been under water,

1086
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:04,150
I believe before.

1087
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:05,160
Anyway.
Really?

1088
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,260
Yeah.
So the c level kind of went back to it.

1089
00:49:07,261 --> 00:49:12,261
That's what happened in parts of Jersey.
The he level just went back to what I 

1090
00:49:12,261 --> 00:49:12,261
was,
you know,

1091
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:15,640
it was the weirdest thing.
It wasn't just,

1092
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,260
it was,
I mean it was just like,

1093
00:49:17,261 --> 00:49:19,120
it wasn't like blowing and lightening 
and all.

1094
00:49:19,121 --> 00:49:19,680
I was just like,
the,

1095
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:21,520
just the ocean come up,
I'll take that.

1096
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:26,670
You know what I mean?
They said parts of Jersey in that those 

1097
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:26,670
areas will never be the same.
They may never come back.

1098
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:31,480
There was areas it just got so wiped 
over there to build something out there.

1099
00:49:31,661 --> 00:49:33,360
Like the odds that,
that would stay there and the eyes,

1100
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:35,110
the water's not going to hit that spot 
again.

1101
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:37,080
I was watching some of have footage of 
the uh,

1102
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:42,600
that title was in Japan and how they 
roll through and it looks like just 

1103
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:44,530
water and you think,
well it's just water.

1104
00:49:44,531 --> 00:49:47,110
If they take everything like cars and 
boats.

1105
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:51,910
That was something that haunt that 
footage from.

1106
00:49:51,911 --> 00:49:56,470
That haunted me for the longest time.
Trying to get away from that and that in

1107
00:49:56,770 --> 00:50:01,770
historical perspective compared to some 
of the events that we know have 

1108
00:50:01,770 --> 00:50:02,360
happened,
like giant titles.

1109
00:50:02,630 --> 00:50:06,070
So they know about that Canary Islands 
Shelf.

1110
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:08,410
Apparently there's like a shelf in 
Africa.

1111
00:50:08,411 --> 00:50:11,980
There's a gigantic volcanic shelf and 
when it breaks off,

1112
00:50:12,190 --> 00:50:17,170
the fucking water comes at us and it 
could go deep in on the east coast.

1113
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,870
Many miles.
How many miles?

1114
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:20,890
Yeah,
the weight,

1115
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:25,920
because you're talking about essentially
a mountain falling into the ocean and 

1116
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:31,460
this incredible blast of energy which 
carries this water,

1117
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:35,990
this huge tidal wave that starts in the 
middle of fucking,

1118
00:50:36,130 --> 00:50:38,180
you know,
wherever that is,

1119
00:50:38,181 --> 00:50:43,181
the Canary Islands and goes 500 miles an
hour across the ocean and then slams 

1120
00:50:43,551 --> 00:50:46,720
into 500 miles an hour.
It's.

1121
00:50:46,730 --> 00:50:48,560
You could imagine.
I mean some of the catastrophes,

1122
00:50:48,561 --> 00:50:49,400
but there were so few.

1123
00:50:50,370 --> 00:50:53,550
It wasn't just last civil Muslim 
civilization.

1124
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:55,760
Whatever sounds good.
I made it up,

1125
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:57,680
but whatever it is,
it's going to.

1126
00:50:57,830 --> 00:50:58,490
Yeah.
I mean,

1127
00:50:58,491 --> 00:50:59,600
look,
they found many,

1128
00:50:59,601 --> 00:51:00,830
many,
especially near Spain,

1129
00:51:00,831 --> 00:51:02,400
many,
many sunken civilization.

1130
00:51:02,430 --> 00:51:04,910
They found the one that they were 
calling it Lantis,

1131
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:07,190
whether or not Atlanta was actually a 
physical place,

1132
00:51:07,191 --> 00:51:12,191
but it's got concentric circles just 
like they believe Atlanta still maybe 

1133
00:51:12,191 --> 00:51:12,790
inspired by.
No,

1134
00:51:12,810 --> 00:51:15,200
not craig total because that wasn't 
recorded history.

1135
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:19,270
What those 1800 explosion never heard on
Earth Day,

1136
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:22,240
right?
The pyro plastic glass that just feel.

1137
00:51:22,870 --> 00:51:25,580
I don't think it's really.
There's a general consensus.

1138
00:51:25,581 --> 00:51:30,581
I don't think they've reached that 
conclusion with the Atlantis was asking 

1139
00:51:30,581 --> 00:51:32,300
was whether or not I didn't.
This is troy.

1140
00:51:32,450 --> 00:51:33,200
Yeah.
It was real.

1141
00:51:33,230 --> 00:51:34,400
Yeah.
That's a fascinating.

1142
00:51:34,730 --> 00:51:39,730
Like what was troy?
Troy and troy was the guy made a bunch 

1143
00:51:40,881 --> 00:51:45,881
of morning the California gold rush or 
something went and kind of like started 

1144
00:51:45,881 --> 00:51:45,950
mapping out what troy was a German guy.

1145
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:50,980
Can't remember his name.
So is it like under contention whether 

1146
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:50,980
or not that's actually troy.
Yeah.

1147
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:52,910
There's this guy that,
and I don't know where it's at now.

1148
00:51:52,911 --> 00:51:57,911
I just remember in college you're 
talking about this and registered by 

1149
00:51:57,911 --> 00:52:00,371
this guy.
This Guy German had made a bunch of 

1150
00:52:00,371 --> 00:52:02,501
money in the California gold rush.
Then went to find any little computer 

1151
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:07,661
there and went in and spend too much 
time trying to locate troy and they 

1152
00:52:07,661 --> 00:52:11,111
don't think that it was over Helen,
but I was like a trade war and there's 

1153
00:52:11,111 --> 00:52:11,111
some mention of like,
um,

1154
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:15,270
some of the integral characters,
like not odysseus or,

1155
00:52:15,650 --> 00:52:18,890
um,
but some of the agamemnon or some of the

1156
00:52:18,891 --> 00:52:23,891
higher up kings,
there's some like historical allusions 

1157
00:52:23,891 --> 00:52:24,050
to who these characters might've been to
got involved in that war,

1158
00:52:24,770 --> 00:52:26,930
but it wasn't like the face that 
launched a thousand ships.

1159
00:52:26,931 --> 00:52:28,490
I think it might have been a trade 
dispute,

1160
00:52:29,270 --> 00:52:30,560
but I'm telling you some data stuff,
man,

1161
00:52:30,561 --> 00:52:32,420
because I was in college in the mid 
nineties,

1162
00:52:32,421 --> 00:52:33,230
mid to late nineties.

1163
00:52:33,230 --> 00:52:36,130
So that was what I knew.
Then you'll find that guys name it.

1164
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:38,200
So the idea was that this guy,
uh,

1165
00:52:38,230 --> 00:52:38,870
he,
he,

1166
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:42,380
he believed that it wasn't fiction.
He believed that it was,

1167
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:47,620
but he had devoted to him the latter 
part of his life to identifying what 

1168
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:49,780
troy would have been.
And he had a.

1169
00:52:50,150 --> 00:52:54,830
He had a somewhat accepted.
When I learned about this,

1170
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:59,920
he had a somewhat.
He had come to a somewhat accepted 

1171
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:03,550
conclusion about what troy was maybe 
some of the principal characters were 

1172
00:53:03,550 --> 00:53:07,421
involved,
were in fact like some of the people 

1173
00:53:07,421 --> 00:53:10,151
that are discussed in the Odyssey and 
the Iliad were in fact living people at 

1174
00:53:11,181 --> 00:53:16,181
that time and they were engaged in a 
large and there was a large battle in a 

1175
00:53:16,181 --> 00:53:19,931
siege of the city and out of that was 
born that legend of the siege of troy in

1176
00:53:20,810 --> 00:53:23,760
the story of the Iliad.
You know what's really fascinating about

1177
00:53:23,761 --> 00:53:26,340
like ancient Rome and ancient Greece and
these incredible

1178
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:30,330
structures that they built,
is that they just all fell apart.

1179
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:33,450
Like nothing's going on there now.
I mean,

1180
00:53:33,451 --> 00:53:38,451
I mean,
I guess the people live in and having a 

1181
00:53:38,451 --> 00:53:40,341
good time living their life,
but no one thinks to be greases almost 

1182
00:53:40,341 --> 00:53:40,341
bankrupt.
Right?

1183
00:53:40,341 --> 00:53:41,190
Onto your bank.
They're fucked.

1184
00:53:41,370 --> 00:53:42,750
And Rome.
I mean,

1185
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:45,090
Italy is just kind of hanging out in 
Europe,

1186
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:47,250
but if you stop and think about what,
you know,

1187
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:50,400
the,
the insane society they had at one point

1188
00:53:50,401 --> 00:53:55,401
in time where no one anywhere else in 
the world at anything comparable people 

1189
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:58,140
fucking people that don't work.
And people have written

1190
00:53:59,010 --> 00:54:03,130
books and certainly articles about how 
Greece has never,

1191
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:06,490
hasn't produced a whole lot of artistic 
expression.

1192
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:11,580
That's world class artistic expression 
for three 3,500

1193
00:54:12,071 --> 00:54:16,180
years or whatever of our long time.
Mainly because,

1194
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:18,790
you know,
you had some examples are examples,

1195
00:54:18,791 --> 00:54:22,240
but mainly because they have that legacy
looming over them.

1196
00:54:22,270 --> 00:54:27,270
You got to Athens,
the Acropolis is right there looking 

1197
00:54:27,270 --> 00:54:29,490
over the city and humbles you.
It humbles you.

1198
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,960
The idea of why would I do anything when
I come from,

1199
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:37,140
when it's already been done,
sort of the idea is looking at us now 

1200
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:40,360
and uh,
she was at home with really shitty books

1201
00:54:42,930 --> 00:54:47,930
that I was trying to write a script and 
I read faulkner and I was like,

1202
00:54:48,790 --> 00:54:51,880
what the fuck do I have to say about 
anything?

1203
00:54:52,110 --> 00:54:55,180
They the great genius.
I'm reading his imagery and stuff.

1204
00:54:55,181 --> 00:54:56,170
And I was like,
first of all,

1205
00:54:56,171 --> 00:54:58,510
I don't even know.
It's the craziest.

1206
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:00,980
He was such a crazy,
unbelievable writer.

1207
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Like on every level either beat,
beat you down or.

1208
00:55:04,650 --> 00:55:05,690
Yeah.
But I was like,

1209
00:55:05,710 --> 00:55:08,950
but what do I have to add to the Canon 
of literature?

1210
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:10,420
Zero.
Hey Bri,

1211
00:55:10,421 --> 00:55:12,310
you're going to run a fucking screenplay
about,

1212
00:55:12,311 --> 00:55:13,780
you know,
but you got to keep doing it.

1213
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:16,660
You just can't think like that.

1214
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:20,090
Getting be inspired.
You have to be inspired.

1215
00:55:20,290 --> 00:55:22,930
That can be very self defeating,
but people do think like that.

1216
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:24,570
They fuck themselves.
It's a trick.

1217
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:25,770
You got to just go.
You're.

1218
00:55:25,970 --> 00:55:27,750
If you do the work,
you have something to say,

1219
00:55:27,830 --> 00:55:29,190
right?
I mean your experience,

1220
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:30,360
you.
Someone said to me,

1221
00:55:30,361 --> 00:55:30,840
he goes,
well,

1222
00:55:30,841 --> 00:55:31,350
you know,
listen,

1223
00:55:31,351 --> 00:55:32,790
I'll never be well off.
I go,

1224
00:55:32,970 --> 00:55:35,610
what the fuck is terrible?
I can even say that.

1225
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:37,350
How can those words even come out of 
your mouth?

1226
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:38,940
I'll never be well off.
That's it.

1227
00:55:38,941 --> 00:55:40,380
You tap,
you're done.

1228
00:55:40,810 --> 00:55:41,350
Just gonna like the

1229
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:46,800
coast from they've been to.
They've allowed other people to define 

1230
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:49,701
them.
Lot of times that's how you define 

1231
00:55:49,701 --> 00:55:49,701
yourself and you hold onto that 
definition.

1232
00:55:49,701 --> 00:55:52,980
Those lines become very strong because 
trying to step over them is too scary.

1233
00:55:52,981 --> 00:55:55,950
It's you've been disappointed too many 
times and you've given up,

1234
00:55:56,370 --> 00:55:58,560
but it's just.
It's all false belief system.

1235
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:00,930
Yeah,
and it's how much energy do you have?

1236
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:03,540
How many did you do?
Have enough energy to really pursue.

1237
00:56:03,630 --> 00:56:04,320
Yeah,
but energy,

1238
00:56:04,321 --> 00:56:09,321
I transfer energy to being something 
called inspiration you may have or you 

1239
00:56:09,321 --> 00:56:13,401
have no energy unless you,
unless somebody provides you with a 

1240
00:56:13,401 --> 00:56:14,970
blueprint or the inspiration to do so.
Right?

1241
00:56:15,290 --> 00:56:16,740
You know,
one of the things they say is that,

1242
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:17,470
um,
if,

1243
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:19,580
if you can,
you can,

1244
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:20,820
a lot of times you can,
uh,

1245
00:56:20,850 --> 00:56:24,880
you can motivate yourself by,
by defining on what you're going to lose

1246
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:26,230
as opposed to what you're going to be.
Again,

1247
00:56:26,590 --> 00:56:28,030
we're really good at dealing with 
things.

1248
00:56:28,031 --> 00:56:30,180
I didn't get that and then we just come.
But they,

1249
00:56:30,181 --> 00:56:32,670
they say that psychologist sometimes 
they'll tell you what do you.

1250
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,930
If you don't do this thing that you want
to do,

1251
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:38,320
what do you actually lose?
What are you not going to get?

1252
00:56:38,321 --> 00:56:40,240
What are you going to lose that you 
already have?

1253
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:45,480
And when you start framing somebody in a
motivational incentives that way they 

1254
00:56:47,890 --> 00:56:50,650
will tend to.
They will tend to work a lot harder

1255
00:56:51,630 --> 00:56:53,440
all the time.
And I'm always motivated.

1256
00:56:53,470 --> 00:56:58,120
I'm always motivated by what you're 
gonna lose as opposed to a man because I

1257
00:56:58,121 --> 00:57:02,140
always feel like,
like I've carved out an existence that's

1258
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:06,220
way better than I would imagine out of 
carved out,

1259
00:57:06,750 --> 00:57:08,290
you know what I mean?
So it's like I'm not motivated,

1260
00:57:08,291 --> 00:57:11,410
but what I didn't get,
I'm always motivated in a way,

1261
00:57:11,411 --> 00:57:16,411
but what I did get,
now I want to do something like I want 

1262
00:57:16,411 --> 00:57:18,790
to be spending much time outside,
I won't be able to on a lot.

1263
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:21,850
And then now it's not that I don't feel 
like I got gypped.

1264
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:22,330
I'm like,
man,

1265
00:57:22,331 --> 00:57:27,331
I got to hang on to.
Well you're not sweet situation to hang 

1266
00:57:27,331 --> 00:57:27,600
onto it.
It's kind of scary as anything.

1267
00:57:27,630 --> 00:57:32,630
It's,
it's as scary as striving toward 

1268
00:57:32,630 --> 00:57:32,630
something.
But.

1269
00:57:32,630 --> 00:57:32,630
Well I did

1270
00:57:32,630 --> 00:57:33,130
to realize that like I went and bought 
some mats and I,

1271
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:38,150
I'm,
I'm enrolling with my buddy and my 

1272
00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:38,150
garage and I was like,
why didn't you.

1273
00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:38,150
That's like what?
He goes,

1274
00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:38,180
what do you want to do?
Because you don't want to lose.

1275
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:40,230
I don't want to gain my black belt.
I think,

1276
00:57:40,231 --> 00:57:43,080
I don't know,
but I don't want to lose.

1277
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:46,820
I don't want to feel like I lose my 
manhood and I think that's what I'm kind

1278
00:57:46,821 --> 00:57:48,690
of working through.
Eight.

1279
00:57:48,691 --> 00:57:50,610
Yeah.
I think maybe I'm holding onto something

1280
00:57:50,670 --> 00:57:55,670
something and I'm trying to.
What I'm doing in my garage for an hour 

1281
00:57:55,670 --> 00:57:57,900
like I did the other day.
I think I'm trying not to lose something

1282
00:57:57,901 --> 00:57:59,370
as opposed to gaining something.
Maybe.

1283
00:57:59,430 --> 00:58:00,170
I don't know.
Maybe we're just.

1284
00:58:00,230 --> 00:58:02,370
Maybe I'm kind of playing.
This is a great.

1285
00:58:02,371 --> 00:58:05,380
I'm glad I came just for that little bit
of insight about like,

1286
00:58:05,490 --> 00:58:10,490
you know how to have bill loser losers 
by the prospect of lost rather than 

1287
00:58:11,990 --> 00:58:15,150
motivated by the prospect of loss rather
than motivated by what you might get.

1288
00:58:15,151 --> 00:58:20,151
That's right.
Fucking man up and do the work and show 

1289
00:58:20,151 --> 00:58:22,110
your bullshit mouth talking nonsense.
Just fucking do it.

1290
00:58:22,111 --> 00:58:23,900
If you want to get better at wrestling 
and Jujitsu,

1291
00:58:23,910 --> 00:58:26,880
do it because it's fun.
Stop with all this nonsense.

1292
00:58:26,881 --> 00:58:29,550
You're running your own brain because I 
like horse shit.

1293
00:58:29,730 --> 00:58:32,160
Am I doing this because I'm afraid to 
lose?

1294
00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:35,460
Or you're going to write poetry now to 
bring me flowers,

1295
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:40,470
bitch until you stuck.
Now you squash my poetic spirit is 

1296
00:58:40,470 --> 00:58:44,010
talking nonsense about to break into a 
song.

1297
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:49,320
Rolling because it's fun.
Stupid.

1298
00:58:49,321 --> 00:58:51,480
You're a monkey.
Monkeys like to choke each other.

1299
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:53,820
It's awesome times.
Whatever.

1300
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:55,470
Why am I doing?
Come on,

1301
00:58:55,471 --> 00:58:56,610
man.
You can waste slipper.

1302
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:59,040
You can waste your fucking energy.
What?

1303
00:58:59,041 --> 00:59:00,540
Why?
Why pursue these things?

1304
00:59:00,541 --> 00:59:02,250
I enjoy.
Just fucking pursue the things.

1305
00:59:02,251 --> 00:59:07,251
You enjoy it.
That's why you got to get rid of that 

1306
00:59:07,251 --> 00:59:07,251
fucking Prius.
Hey man,

1307
00:59:07,251 --> 00:59:07,251
no,
no.

1308
00:59:07,251 --> 00:59:09,360
You don't want to drive that car.
I know.

1309
00:59:09,361 --> 00:59:11,400
I'm trying to talk him into a shelby 
Mustang.

1310
00:59:12,630 --> 00:59:17,630
I'm telling him that he has done his 
stand at this stage of life that we in 

1311
00:59:17,630 --> 00:59:20,490
the cars that are available to you right
now or like little ride.

1312
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:25,520
Give me.
Take three cars to get and make them 

1313
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:25,520
practical.
Fucking practical.

1314
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,440
Whore mouth.
This is what you need.

1315
00:59:27,590 --> 00:59:32,590
You need a shelby Mustang.
The new one run your engine and when 

1316
00:59:33,741 --> 00:59:35,270
you're stuck in traffic or something 
like,

1317
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:36,260
oh,
you want to hear it?

1318
00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:41,260
You want to be able to hear it.
You want to be able to hear the rumble 

1319
00:59:41,260 --> 00:59:41,600
under this blue bubble.
It bring you back to your childhood.

1320
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:45,350
It will give you a burst of endorphins 
as you drive it.

1321
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:47,990
A make you feel you never had one.
That's why.

1322
00:59:47,991 --> 00:59:50,560
Because you never had one.
You don't even trust me thinking like,

1323
00:59:50,690 --> 00:59:53,300
do I love this car?
Because I'm afraid of losing something.

1324
00:59:53,870 --> 00:59:54,560
That's it.
Yeah.

1325
00:59:54,561 --> 00:59:55,270
That's what you think.
This,

1326
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:59,400
that's an old [inaudible] 69.
No,

1327
00:59:59,401 --> 00:59:59,720
no,
no,

1328
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:00,110
no.
Uh,

1329
01:00:00,111 --> 01:00:00,940
I have,
uh,

1330
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:03,500
one of the modern ones.
I have a modern one.

1331
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:08,560
The shelby gt 500.
There's a new one that's coming out now 

1332
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:12,440
that has 606.
Two horsepower.

1333
01:00:12,510 --> 01:00:13,760
Am I going to do with that thing?
Oh,

1334
01:00:13,761 --> 01:00:15,620
you're going to enjoy the fuck out of 
it.

1335
01:00:15,770 --> 01:00:20,770
That's what you're gonna do that.
Because I think about horsepower in 

1336
01:00:20,770 --> 01:00:20,770
terms of boats.

1337
01:00:20,770 --> 01:00:25,490
It looks like when you have a $600,
that's a lot of horse preposterous car 

1338
01:00:25,490 --> 01:00:25,880
for a human being to drive.
Absolutely.

1339
01:00:25,881 --> 01:00:27,050
Proportionately.
Not Getting that,

1340
01:00:27,051 --> 01:00:31,730
but give me something else to get that 
just to just to fucking for once in your

1341
01:00:31,731 --> 01:00:36,731
life.
Just have something like that and 

1342
01:00:36,731 --> 01:00:38,851
understand what the fuck is going on.
I'm trying to tell you about something 

1343
01:00:38,851 --> 01:00:38,851
awesome and you'll let go and want to be
awesome.

1344
01:00:38,851 --> 01:00:40,280
I know what you like.
Stupid.

1345
01:00:40,310 --> 01:00:43,740
I just have never done one.
This motivation.

1346
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:48,050
You're tapping into my 12 year old 
psyche.

1347
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:53,080
Me and him have.
You just don't want to be as 

1348
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:53,090
consumptive.
Now I just know what Joe's doing.

1349
01:00:53,091 --> 01:00:54,140
Yeah.
I'm just lazy,

1350
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:57,590
but just doing justice.
Just tapping into my.

1351
01:00:57,740 --> 01:00:58,430
He's like,
come on,

1352
01:00:59,150 --> 01:01:04,150
get to fucking get that dog.
Get the one that's going to now go 

1353
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:06,690
heavier more and more and I'm like this.

1354
01:01:06,690 --> 01:01:07,250
I'm like,
no.

1355
01:01:07,251 --> 01:01:09,560
I'm a naturally moderate person.
Stopped and he's like,

1356
01:01:09,590 --> 01:01:11,810
he's always behind me going,
come on,

1357
01:01:11,970 --> 01:01:12,620
push,
push,

1358
01:01:12,621 --> 01:01:13,940
push.
He's the.

1359
01:01:13,941 --> 01:01:15,320
He's my canary in the coal mine.
We have.

1360
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:17,300
We've had fun for years.
Their greatest.

1361
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:18,620
We've had a good time,
my friend,

1362
01:01:18,950 --> 01:01:23,950
but I always end up coming around.
We don't want to tell you about the 

1363
01:01:24,201 --> 01:01:24,650
show.
Wait,

1364
01:01:24,651 --> 01:01:25,430
wait,
don't tell me.

1365
01:01:25,850 --> 01:01:26,240
Wait,
wait,

1366
01:01:26,241 --> 01:01:31,241
don't tell me on NPR quiz show,
but there's the head of the thing about 

1367
01:01:31,241 --> 01:01:31,241
the news.
I want to tell you,

1368
01:01:31,241 --> 01:01:33,470
this guy apparently I might have got 
this wrong,

1369
01:01:33,471 --> 01:01:35,780
but I don't think I did last week.
They were talking about too weird.

1370
01:01:35,790 --> 01:01:40,790
Nine slash 11 calls that came in and a 
guy called nine one one because it's a 

1371
01:01:40,790 --> 01:01:41,090
hamster had had babies.

1372
01:01:44,540 --> 01:01:47,180
Apparently some guy last be called nine 
one one because he saw a big foot.

1373
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:52,840
Oh my God.
So I think that would be the correct 

1374
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:57,401
move if he really did.
Now let's say now I know you don't 

1375
01:01:57,401 --> 01:01:57,401
believe in big foot.
I've talked to him.

1376
01:01:57,401 --> 01:01:59,130
You've talked to big foot.
No.

1377
01:01:59,710 --> 01:02:02,780
Your theory about why big foot can exist
because he has.

1378
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:05,930
He has no hair on his top of his feet 
and his hands.

1379
01:02:05,931 --> 01:02:07,790
Right.
That's someone else.

1380
01:02:08,270 --> 01:02:10,760
Mine is just that he can't exist because
he would have.

1381
01:02:11,170 --> 01:02:13,000
There would be dead ones laying around 
known.

1382
01:02:13,030 --> 01:02:15,680
Then like every other thing,
that's how many times have you ever seen

1383
01:02:15,681 --> 01:02:17,450
like a dead mountain lion?
Have you seen him?

1384
01:02:17,540 --> 01:02:18,870
Like just.
I mean,

1385
01:02:18,930 --> 01:02:20,220
no,
I mean not ones you shot.

1386
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:25,220
I mean,
have you ever run across one that you 

1387
01:02:25,220 --> 01:02:25,220
found that it just died of natural 
causes or.

1388
01:02:25,290 --> 01:02:29,130
I'd like to lie to you and say that I 
have found lions died of natural causes,

1389
01:02:29,131 --> 01:02:31,350
but I have not found natural causes,
but

1390
01:02:32,490 --> 01:02:33,090
um,

1391
01:02:33,350 --> 01:02:35,720
I've seen them in the wild three times.
Three times.

1392
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:36,350
Yeah.
The,

1393
01:02:36,351 --> 01:02:41,351
I mean I don't,
I don't have any chips in the sasquatch 

1394
01:02:41,351 --> 01:02:45,671
camp,
but Jane Goodall says that she believes 

1395
01:02:45,671 --> 01:02:45,770
that it exists and that's fascinating to
me.

1396
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:50,800
She didn't say was that there's a 
species we and she thinks it's a 

1397
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:50,800
gigantic pool.
What about those ones?

1398
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:55,451
So what more do we know about those ones
in the Congo that are totally different 

1399
01:02:55,451 --> 01:02:55,451
animals,
chimps?

1400
01:02:55,820 --> 01:03:00,820
Jane Goodall believes,
I'm pretty sure is that it's a gigantic 

1401
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:03,260
pythagoras,
which was a real animal existed in Asia.

1402
01:03:03,290 --> 01:03:05,660
The most recent example of it was 
100,000

1403
01:03:05,661 --> 01:03:09,200
years ago.
So the idea is that we think is extinct,

1404
01:03:09,201 --> 01:03:11,640
but it might not have been because we 
know it coexisted with people.

1405
01:03:11,641 --> 01:03:15,080
And really it wasn't discovered,
I think until the 19 twenties who's,

1406
01:03:15,140 --> 01:03:18,260
I think it was discovered some somewhere
in early 19 hundreds.

1407
01:03:18,350 --> 01:03:23,350
There was a guy who came into apothecary
shop where they would sell like a 

1408
01:03:23,350 --> 01:03:25,280
fucking home remedies and shit,
ground goat,

1409
01:03:25,281 --> 01:03:30,281
Dick and stuff like that.
Chinese places are really into that and 

1410
01:03:30,281 --> 01:03:31,640
they had this giant primate tooth and 
this guy examined it.

1411
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:31,940
He said,
well,

1412
01:03:31,941 --> 01:03:33,800
what the fuck is this?
Well,

1413
01:03:33,801 --> 01:03:36,770
it turned out it was a totally different
species and nobody ever heard of.

1414
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:40,220
And it's an eight foot bipedal primate 
that buried.

1415
01:03:40,221 --> 01:03:42,470
It's young are buried.
It's dead rather.

1416
01:03:42,710 --> 01:03:43,370
Wow.
Yeah.

1417
01:03:43,371 --> 01:03:45,440
They believed they stack their dead.
Yeah.

1418
01:03:45,830 --> 01:03:50,830
So the,
the idea that this thing existed 

1419
01:03:50,830 --> 01:03:50,830
alongside human beings and it really 
did.

1420
01:03:50,870 --> 01:03:55,870
I love how they can,
how they can like take a piece of bone 

1421
01:03:55,870 --> 01:03:56,560
and construct an entire.
But thanks.

1422
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:58,100
They often can't.
I mean,

1423
01:03:58,101 --> 01:03:59,360
you can tell a lot.
There was a lot.

1424
01:03:59,361 --> 01:04:01,010
I mean like as in I don't criticize 
people,

1425
01:04:01,011 --> 01:04:04,190
like a lot of people get off on looking 
at mistakes,

1426
01:04:05,140 --> 01:04:06,700
you know,
that scientists have made like,

1427
01:04:06,820 --> 01:04:07,630
oh,
they thought this.

1428
01:04:07,631 --> 01:04:12,330
And other times it's like they're trying
to put together a cohesive narrative and

1429
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:17,360
it's in the scientific process is always
inviting people to add on and make 

1430
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:21,631
corrections.
But some people are fixed on this idea 

1431
01:04:21,631 --> 01:04:21,631
that if you can't get everything exactly
right the first time,

1432
01:04:21,631 --> 01:04:24,040
you have no business even dabbling in.
So I'm like,

1433
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:27,340
when people have made mistakes in 
talking about like lineages,

1434
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:32,400
I'm not down on them,
I don't like glorifying the mistakes to 

1435
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:32,400
point out that it's all few tile and you
know,

1436
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:35,600
it's all bs but.
But they make mistakes.

1437
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:41,080
Mistakes are made and I think you've got
to continue chipping away at it and can 

1438
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:41,240
you try to add to it.
But the,

1439
01:04:41,270 --> 01:04:45,850
but the big foot thing of all the 
species that we have,

1440
01:04:45,851 --> 01:04:48,790
the endangered species that we have in 
talking about North America,

1441
01:04:48,791 --> 01:04:51,550
the ones that have,
that we knew we had and they went away,

1442
01:04:52,180 --> 01:04:57,180
went away.
And in some of the ones that we knew 

1443
01:04:57,180 --> 01:04:59,671
were hanging on,
we still have a big problem with 

1444
01:04:59,671 --> 01:04:59,671
mortality on those things.
And we find them.

1445
01:04:59,671 --> 01:05:02,530
You have very few Florida panthers every
year they're getting hit on the highway.

1446
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:05,030
Thank God.
Kill those creepy Fox.

1447
01:05:05,060 --> 01:05:08,560
Hey dog eating assholes.
Dog Eaten.

1448
01:05:09,510 --> 01:05:10,960
How would you like?
Not like panthers.

1449
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:12,710
Eight.
My dog.

1450
01:05:13,340 --> 01:05:14,750
Dog to him.
The line here?

1451
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:14,940
Yeah.
Yeah.

1452
01:05:14,980 --> 01:05:16,070
No,
that's awesome.

1453
01:05:16,570 --> 01:05:17,680
Yeah.
Beautiful.

1454
01:05:17,770 --> 01:05:17,980
But

1455
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:19,450
they're killers.
They're fucking killers.

1456
01:05:19,670 --> 01:05:21,230
They shouldn't be in America.
Sorry.

1457
01:05:21,231 --> 01:05:23,210
Two minutes.
None of them that I'm not tolerate.

1458
01:05:23,610 --> 01:05:23,810
Yeah.

1459
01:05:27,260 --> 01:05:29,720
Anything that could kill me.
You go fuck yourself.

1460
01:05:29,830 --> 01:05:32,690
If it might eat you one day.
Did you ever see that video of the woman

1461
01:05:32,691 --> 01:05:36,800
in Russia where she's in town in Russia 
and a polar bear,

1462
01:05:36,801 --> 01:05:41,801
it's made its way into the town,
isn't attacking her and everyone's 

1463
01:05:41,801 --> 01:05:42,280
screaming and throwing shit at the bear.
Ever seen that Jamie?

1464
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:44,540
Oh Dude.
Yeah.

1465
01:05:44,541 --> 01:05:47,900
Woman attacked by a polar bear in 
Russia.

1466
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:49,980
A tough fucking.
It's terrifying.

1467
01:05:49,981 --> 01:05:53,660
The bears just legit.
No 100 percent.

1468
01:05:53,661 --> 01:05:55,970
And she got away.
She got away because it got through like

1469
01:05:56,180 --> 01:06:01,180
it looks like you threw a tire iron at,
at the bear and the clunk the bear and 

1470
01:06:01,180 --> 01:06:01,470
the bear just freaked out and ran away.
Wow.

1471
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:02,110
And she,
uh,

1472
01:06:02,150 --> 01:06:04,950
she had her pants down and she's like 
pulling her pants on,

1473
01:06:04,951 --> 01:06:06,200
but trying to get away the bear like,

1474
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:11,500
just launched it.
Why wasn't he over there trying to help 

1475
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:11,500
her out?
They were all yelling.

1476
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:15,571
They're in apartment buildings.
They were terrified film and everything 

1477
01:06:15,571 --> 01:06:15,571
instead of getting in there.
And.

1478
01:06:15,571 --> 01:06:16,630
Well,
that's when you don't want to get eaten,

1479
01:06:16,870 --> 01:06:18,040
you know,
if they don't have guns,

1480
01:06:18,850 --> 01:06:20,740
if I see a polar bear,
polar bear,

1481
01:06:20,741 --> 01:06:24,600
I'm running away guys.
I love you all see a polar bear.

1482
01:06:25,030 --> 01:06:27,460
And he and he started gouging you with 
these,

1483
01:06:27,590 --> 01:06:29,060
right?
I would never be like,

1484
01:06:29,061 --> 01:06:30,800
oh,
I'm going to make a movie of this.

1485
01:06:32,510 --> 01:06:34,940
It's really flattering on his graph to 
compare.

1486
01:06:35,050 --> 01:06:40,050
Her shoulders is a big gym.
I winced brian trying to eat people.

1487
01:06:40,420 --> 01:06:41,910
This is the woman to see the,
um,

1488
01:06:42,150 --> 01:06:43,950
the middle of it to that lady right 
there.

1489
01:06:43,951 --> 01:06:46,200
It's like near that fence.
Watch this.

1490
01:06:46,260 --> 01:06:47,700
This is really fucked up,
man.

1491
01:06:47,730 --> 01:06:50,070
She's ducking right now here.
Cozy bear.

1492
01:06:51,870 --> 01:06:56,870
Look at the shit.
Look at this ad is a fucking polar bear 

1493
01:06:56,870 --> 01:06:57,460
man.
And so see,

1494
01:06:57,470 --> 01:06:59,280
or some guy throws something and hits 
them.

1495
01:06:59,330 --> 01:07:02,160
That's a young poet.
But it's big enough dude.

1496
01:07:02,430 --> 01:07:04,050
Then they're little babies.
They will fuck you up.

1497
01:07:04,051 --> 01:07:09,051
That shit got jacked and look at her.
She's getting up and her pants are all 

1498
01:07:09,051 --> 01:07:10,040
fucked up.
Yeah.

1499
01:07:10,170 --> 01:07:12,030
Run girl run.
She's,

1500
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:15,660
I think she's really hurt.
That's a scary ass.

1501
01:07:16,310 --> 01:07:16,390
It's

1502
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:18,860
that thing just took a couple of nips in
a village.

1503
01:07:18,861 --> 01:07:20,840
Just came into a village,
you know?

1504
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:22,970
Yeah.
They don't fuck around there.

1505
01:07:22,971 --> 01:07:24,980
They eat everything that moves.
That's polar.

1506
01:07:24,981 --> 01:07:26,510
Bears are way scarier,
right?

1507
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:28,280
That's what they're worried about.
That hybrid.

1508
01:07:28,281 --> 01:07:30,760
The hybrid between the polar keep 
turning up.

1509
01:07:30,770 --> 01:07:32,720
I got shot one now.
Really?

1510
01:07:33,350 --> 01:07:36,010
There's a lot of them now though.
Why?

1511
01:07:36,050 --> 01:07:37,490
They didn't know they know about it.
Okay.

1512
01:07:37,491 --> 01:07:38,550
Steve.
This is a.

1513
01:07:38,670 --> 01:07:39,800
they're not,
they're not viable.

1514
01:07:39,801 --> 01:07:41,060
They're not sexually violent.
Right.

1515
01:07:41,090 --> 01:07:43,580
So this is a global warming thing.
Is that what's going on?

1516
01:07:44,140 --> 01:07:49,140
I know that that the theory I'm familiar
with is people suggested it might begin 

1517
01:07:49,670 --> 01:07:54,670
to happen more as you lose as the polar 
ice cap recedes and polar bears aren't 

1518
01:07:57,261 --> 01:08:01,060
able to spend as much time out on the 
CIS that they'll be coming inland.

1519
01:08:01,070 --> 01:08:02,510
More so.
I think there's been.

1520
01:08:03,230 --> 01:08:08,230
My understanding again is there's been 
an increase in the distance inland that 

1521
01:08:08,230 --> 01:08:12,611
people have been encountering some bears
and it's a greater likelihood of 

1522
01:08:12,611 --> 01:08:16,181
bringing polar bears into what would be 
traditionally like interior grizzly and 

1523
01:08:16,181 --> 01:08:16,181
saw

1524
01:08:16,181 --> 01:08:19,460
some hybrids have turned up,
but I don't know.

1525
01:08:20,270 --> 01:08:25,270
They're not viable and I don't know if 
anyone knows like in a bulletproof way 

1526
01:08:25,270 --> 01:08:26,660
that this wasn't happening before and 
it's happening now.

1527
01:08:26,690 --> 01:08:29,100
But I think just in a logical sense,
if bear,

1528
01:08:29,150 --> 01:08:31,760
if there's not going to be the 
availability of sea ice,

1529
01:08:32,410 --> 01:08:37,410
you know,
bears are going to spend more time on 

1530
01:08:37,410 --> 01:08:37,520
ground which is going to bring them 
into.

1531
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:42,720
You know,
when grizzly bears are out of 

1532
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:44,471
hibernation in the spring is going to 
bring them into more contact so that as 

1533
01:08:44,471 --> 01:08:45,110
people say,
but a guy,

1534
01:08:45,111 --> 01:08:46,400
you know,
there was a guy not know.

1535
01:08:46,410 --> 01:08:49,220
It was a couple of years ago,
a shot one,

1536
01:08:49,221 --> 01:08:51,970
and it was legit.
He knew it was weird when he shot it and

1537
01:08:51,980 --> 01:08:55,160
took it in.
He was a native guy that gives it a shot

1538
01:08:55,161 --> 01:08:57,500
and it was checked out and that's what 
it was.

1539
01:08:57,501 --> 01:08:59,900
What I want to know when we go hunting 
in Alaska,

1540
01:09:00,590 --> 01:09:02,810
I'll be calling anywhere where there are
hybrid,

1541
01:09:02,811 --> 01:09:04,780
barest because I will come with an 
arsenal,

1542
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:09,800
my friend.
I don't know that you can really make 

1543
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:11,711
the case that hybrid bears.
I don't know that there's a case we 

1544
01:09:11,711 --> 01:09:11,720
made.
The hybrid bears are more dangerous than

1545
01:09:11,721 --> 01:09:12,200
900.

1546
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:14,510
Well guess what?
Since you can't make the case.

1547
01:09:14,511 --> 01:09:17,270
I'm going to call.
How about I make the case at all?

1548
01:09:17,271 --> 01:09:20,240
Bears are fucking dangerous.
What are you talking about,

1549
01:09:20,241 --> 01:09:21,260
man?
What do you like?

1550
01:09:21,261 --> 01:09:22,700
Oh,
it's because he's only a grizzly.

1551
01:09:24,190 --> 01:09:26,150
Fucking look at you.
Whatever.

1552
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:28,800
Cold and fairs week.
Silly Bitch.

1553
01:09:29,390 --> 01:09:31,220
I'm going to leave some honey and you 
can just go to that.

1554
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:36,500
I'll use if we don't.
If we go up there would probably be 

1555
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:36,500
okay.
It depends.

1556
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:36,890
Like if,
if we go to an area like a black,

1557
01:09:36,891 --> 01:09:41,891
like just category,
I don't worry about you don't worry 

1558
01:09:41,891 --> 01:09:42,140
about black students generally don't 
worry about black bears,

1559
01:09:42,590 --> 01:09:47,590
but if you go to go to an area that has 
mixed populations where you have an 

1560
01:09:47,590 --> 01:09:49,260
interior areas that you might be wanting
black robes with,

1561
01:09:49,420 --> 01:09:52,550
grizzly bears around,
you deftly got paid more attention to.

1562
01:09:52,820 --> 01:09:54,110
I mean it's just like,
yeah,

1563
01:09:54,111 --> 01:09:55,460
but when you got to pay more attention 
to a,

1564
01:09:55,461 --> 01:09:59,940
mainly you owe it to the area and you 
owe it to the animals to,

1565
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:04,310
to pay attention to it because if you 
just have negligence and just.

1566
01:10:04,311 --> 01:10:06,670
And it leads to a conflict,
you know,

1567
01:10:06,710 --> 01:10:11,710
and you need to pay attention.
You got to look out for them all the 

1568
01:10:11,710 --> 01:10:12,710
time.
Be Be aware,

1569
01:10:12,770 --> 01:10:15,710
don't do stupid things in your camp.
Don't invite disaster,

1570
01:10:16,100 --> 01:10:17,000
which has food.

1571
01:10:17,030 --> 01:10:18,680
Just being clean.
Keeping,

1572
01:10:18,740 --> 01:10:21,380
keeping like being cognizant of what 
threats are.

1573
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:22,340
Well,
let's say where it's either.

1574
01:10:22,370 --> 01:10:23,390
Here's the thing,
it's dark.

1575
01:10:23,710 --> 01:10:26,150
We're cooking meat.
Okay.

1576
01:10:26,330 --> 01:10:27,620
Yep.
Which we did last time.

1577
01:10:28,310 --> 01:10:31,010
That seems to be inviting bears in.
Yeah,

1578
01:10:31,011 --> 01:10:32,240
I think that.
I think that the,

1579
01:10:32,241 --> 01:10:33,290
the,
the goal,

1580
01:10:33,310 --> 01:10:38,310
those kind of strike a balance.
I mean you could live like this really 

1581
01:10:38,310 --> 01:10:41,201
like,
and I know some people we call them 

1582
01:10:41,201 --> 01:10:41,201
being bare annoyed.
Okay.

1583
01:10:41,201 --> 01:10:44,590
I'd also bear annoyed guys who like 
their whole experience in the woods 

1584
01:10:44,590 --> 01:10:49,510
becomes tainted by their fear of bears.
They know they'll only like,

1585
01:10:49,580 --> 01:10:54,140
they'll go off in some other place,
hundreds of yards away and eat food that

1586
01:10:54,141 --> 01:10:56,790
they imagine would be unappealing to a 
bear and,

1587
01:10:56,910 --> 01:10:59,360
and do all this kind of crazy stuff.
And like,

1588
01:10:59,420 --> 01:11:00,260
you know,
they got there,

1589
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:05,320
they brushed her teeth off in a 
different area and hang her toothbrush 

1590
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:07,931
out in a tree because it might smell a 
thing or they don't go out in the woods 

1591
01:11:07,931 --> 01:11:08,210
if their,
if their wives menstruating,

1592
01:11:08,211 --> 01:11:13,211
you know,
they don't want to go out in the woods 

1593
01:11:13,211 --> 01:11:13,211
with her and you're going to go crazy.

1594
01:11:13,211 --> 01:11:16,860
Or you can be like crazy in the other 
extreme and just like,

1595
01:11:17,060 --> 01:11:22,060
you know,
drag kill an animal and drag it back to 

1596
01:11:22,060 --> 01:11:24,261
camp and garden and leave the gut plain 
air for five days to ripen in the sun 

1597
01:11:24,261 --> 01:11:27,531
next to your tent.
Which would be like the other kind of 

1598
01:11:27,531 --> 01:11:30,620
ridiculous or you can kind of walk a 
moderate line and if you can do things 

1599
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:35,451
without tainting your experience,
but just like little common sense 

1600
01:11:35,451 --> 01:11:38,370
issues,
not camping right on top of carcasses.

1601
01:11:39,180 --> 01:11:41,580
If you're cooking smelly food like fish 
and fish,

1602
01:11:41,581 --> 01:11:46,581
guts and stuff.
Be careful about getting rid of that 

1603
01:11:46,581 --> 01:11:46,581
stuff.
Put in your food up in a tree.

1604
01:11:46,581 --> 01:11:48,780
If there's trees available,
if there aren't things,

1605
01:11:48,810 --> 01:11:51,900
then you put your food somewhere where 
you can see it and monitor it.

1606
01:11:51,930 --> 01:11:55,320
Lay sweaty clothes on top of it to 
enhance the human odor in the area.

1607
01:11:55,510 --> 01:11:58,740
I mean just little things you can do 
that don't ruin your time,

1608
01:11:59,190 --> 01:12:02,880
but you're generally trying to like 
decrease the chance that you're going to

1609
01:12:02,881 --> 01:12:04,800
have a conflict.
It's going to have to get the government

1610
01:12:04,801 --> 01:12:09,801
bomb.
They're going to come out and have to 

1611
01:12:09,801 --> 01:12:10,800
kill some bear because he so grizzlies.
When they smell humans tend to avoid him

1612
01:12:11,370 --> 01:12:12,660
I think.
I think.

1613
01:12:12,661 --> 01:12:14,070
Yeah,
and even the ones,

1614
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:17,310
even the ones that don't have experience
with humans.

1615
01:12:18,030 --> 01:12:23,030
You know,
like if you go on a really remote area 

1616
01:12:23,030 --> 01:12:23,030
where you run into barriers to,
you run into like a two year old bear,

1617
01:12:23,030 --> 01:12:27,990
three year old bear and it's reasonable 
to assume he has not had a direct 

1618
01:12:29,190 --> 01:12:32,320
interaction with a human and it was 
possibly he just hasn't.

1619
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:37,640
His parents who is his mother could be 
12 years old and she's had a handful 

1620
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:38,760
throughout 12 year life,
but the other one might not.

1621
01:12:39,030 --> 01:12:41,640
But when they smell you,
oftentimes it's just,

1622
01:12:41,641 --> 01:12:43,740
it's new.
It hits them unlike a d,

1623
01:12:43,770 --> 01:12:48,770
they just smell it.
I think they got the world divided into 

1624
01:12:48,770 --> 01:12:48,900
smells good,
don't smell good.

1625
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:53,960
Yeah.
And I think that some human smells kind 

1626
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:53,960
of like,
I don't like that smell.

1627
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:56,440
It was like a behavior posh and we were 
talking about uh,

1628
01:12:56,441 --> 01:13:01,441
you know,
we did on the show were had to run a 

1629
01:13:01,441 --> 01:13:04,521
bear out of camp and just come and at 
that bear and trying to look big and 

1630
01:13:04,741 --> 01:13:09,480
pissed off and like unyielding speaks to
the bear.

1631
01:13:09,650 --> 01:13:09,930
He's not.
Yeah,

1632
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:12,050
well there is a person and he's likely 
to be armed.

1633
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:17,080
He's just thinking whatever that is.
That thing is pissed off and coming at 

1634
01:13:17,080 --> 01:13:17,120
me for the folks who don't know what 
we're talking about,

1635
01:13:17,121 --> 01:13:22,121
the Tim Ferriss episode of a mediator is
when they went terrible hunting in 

1636
01:13:22,121 --> 01:13:26,531
Alaska,
so if you were looking for the one to 

1637
01:13:26,531 --> 01:13:29,021
watch on TV,
that's the one I'm looking for this 

1638
01:13:29,021 --> 01:13:30,340
particular situation,
but these were big bear sister.

1639
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:34,490
There was one you saw and they didn't 
even bigger one that was running towards

1640
01:13:34,491 --> 01:13:39,491
the camp.
A lot of people are more afraid of the 

1641
01:13:39,491 --> 01:13:39,491
little ones really because the little 
ones haven't.

1642
01:13:39,491 --> 01:13:42,020
They haven't accumulated that.
A set of experiences.

1643
01:13:42,021 --> 01:13:43,220
The teachers,
I'm like,

1644
01:13:43,370 --> 01:13:45,430
what's good and what's bad?
You know about.

1645
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:46,510
Just think about like adolescents,

1646
01:13:46,970 --> 01:13:47,500
it,
you know,

1647
01:13:47,550 --> 01:13:51,680
if you think about if you're going to 
get in like a road rage incident in some

1648
01:13:51,681 --> 01:13:56,681
ways a road rage incident with a guy 
that's 50 isn't quite as dangerous as it

1649
01:13:58,031 --> 01:14:00,530
might be with a guy that's 18.
Like the guy that's 18.

1650
01:14:00,531 --> 01:14:05,531
You don't know what I mean.
He still might be like sorting through 

1651
01:14:05,531 --> 01:14:05,531
some stuff.

1652
01:14:05,531 --> 01:14:05,540
Willing to like.
Yeah.

1653
01:14:05,620 --> 01:14:10,620
Yeah.
He's not aware of how long like driving 

1654
01:14:10,620 --> 01:14:11,830
cars and I think that

1655
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:14,070
so some people that,
and these are guys that know,

1656
01:14:14,390 --> 01:14:16,060
some of you guys know so much more about
bears now do,

1657
01:14:16,061 --> 01:14:17,650
but but people that know,
like look,

1658
01:14:17,651 --> 01:14:22,651
particularly the particularly dangerous 
bears the bears have to watch out for 

1659
01:14:22,651 --> 01:14:26,490
are the ones that have been recently 
kicked out by the mother and the males 

1660
01:14:26,801 --> 01:14:30,670
will will get kicked out and tend to 
have to go farther afield to find a home

1661
01:14:30,671 --> 01:14:35,671
range everywhere they're going,
they're getting beaten up by a resident 

1662
01:14:35,671 --> 01:14:35,800
bear.
They don't.

1663
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:41,120
They don't have a good lock on available
food resources yet is very likely that 

1664
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:42,100
they're hungry.
They're inexperienced,

1665
01:14:42,410 --> 01:14:46,240
they're pressured and when you encounter
those,

1666
01:14:46,241 --> 01:14:47,740
those are the ones that people watch out
for that.

1667
01:14:47,780 --> 01:14:51,070
That's a theory about black bears as 
well,

1668
01:14:51,580 --> 01:14:56,580
but I think that those blackberries are 
more likely to end up like in some tree 

1669
01:14:56,580 --> 01:14:58,090
in the middle of a town.
Young displays ones.

1670
01:14:58,090 --> 01:14:59,710
But again,
I just like generally,

1671
01:15:00,070 --> 01:15:01,650
and you can cite examples of things that
happened,

1672
01:15:01,651 --> 01:15:03,640
like generally like blackbirds are just 
not.

1673
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:08,700
I don't think it as a dangerous bear.
I don't think of blackbirds been any 

1674
01:15:08,700 --> 01:15:08,700
more dangerous than deer being 
dangerous.

1675
01:15:08,700 --> 01:15:11,290
I just,
I'm just not bothered by blackberry is a

1676
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:16,300
crazy video or recently from somewhere 
in Canada where these dudes are treat 

1677
01:15:16,300 --> 01:15:19,330
their in tree stands and they're 
standing there and the bear for whatever

1678
01:15:19,331 --> 01:15:24,331
reason,
just runs up the tree and is beside him 

1679
01:15:24,331 --> 01:15:26,720
in the trailer man in like a couple of 
seconds and he's like,

1680
01:15:27,610 --> 01:15:29,410
they're talking to each other in the 
filming this.

1681
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:33,080
The bear price smelled something like my
dad's buddy got as much as I just said.

1682
01:15:34,180 --> 01:15:38,980
My Dad's buddy got mauled because he was
hunting bears from a tree and a sow with

1683
01:15:38,981 --> 01:15:42,510
cubs came in and he didn't want to shoot
the south cubs.

1684
01:15:42,540 --> 01:15:43,660
You know,
most places you can't,

1685
01:15:44,380 --> 01:15:45,670
but that sounds,
smelled something.

1686
01:15:46,170 --> 01:15:51,170
She smelled a person and her response 
was to shoot her cubs up the tree to 

1687
01:15:51,170 --> 01:15:54,400
safety and she shoot him up his tree.
So when they came past them on history,

1688
01:15:55,330 --> 01:15:59,260
they started squealing and then she came
up and mold his lower legs.

1689
01:15:59,261 --> 01:16:04,261
I remember her.
I remember one night we're sitting in 

1690
01:16:04,261 --> 01:16:04,261
our house,
my dad got a phone call guy used to hunt

1691
01:16:04,261 --> 01:16:07,801
with,
had gotten his lower legs mauled by a 

1692
01:16:07,801 --> 01:16:07,801
bear,
and he eventually founded her off,

1693
01:16:07,801 --> 01:16:10,160
was trying to fend her off of the Arrow 
and that you call this bench.

1694
01:16:10,161 --> 01:16:12,160
She came back down the tree and then 
she'd let him be.

1695
01:16:12,250 --> 01:16:13,990
Oh my God.
So yeah,

1696
01:16:13,991 --> 01:16:15,640
there are,
there are incidents,

1697
01:16:15,641 --> 01:16:18,070
but you can also.
I mean if you're just cruising youtube,

1698
01:16:18,071 --> 01:16:19,920
I mean there's plenty of places where 
you go find a deer,

1699
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:22,630
knock the hell out.
Someone to look at his spirit.

1700
01:16:24,310 --> 01:16:25,980
He's climbing a ladder.
You know,

1701
01:16:26,060 --> 01:16:27,280
it's not a big bear though,

1702
01:16:28,970 --> 01:16:29,860
because look at it two years.

1703
01:16:33,050 --> 01:16:34,160
No.
Is it the best thing to do?

1704
01:16:34,161 --> 01:16:35,480
Just talk to him.
Look at that.

1705
01:16:35,481 --> 01:16:36,890
Bear ran away.
That's big enough.

1706
01:16:37,310 --> 01:16:41,020
That's pretty good.
I just didn't like the,

1707
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:42,160
the accepted.
Well see,

1708
01:16:42,190 --> 01:16:45,290
here's the thing.
It's like some people say that,

1709
01:16:46,250 --> 01:16:48,450
but again this,
you know,

1710
01:16:48,550 --> 01:16:53,550
it's like every.
If you look at like when people own 

1711
01:16:53,550 --> 01:16:53,550
bears actually tagged people,
it's so.

1712
01:16:53,550 --> 01:16:55,610
It's oftentimes just like weird 
circumstances are unpredictable things,

1713
01:16:55,940 --> 01:17:00,940
but the general,
the general thinking it the general 

1714
01:17:00,940 --> 01:17:01,490
wisdom on if a blank bird does attack 
you,

1715
01:17:02,150 --> 01:17:03,800
it's predatory.
Okay.

1716
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:06,440
He's not defending territory.
If a blackberry tanks where he's like,

1717
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:11,500
I'm going to eat that was thinking is 
you fight hell to fight like hell riced.

1718
01:17:12,470 --> 01:17:17,470
If a sal grizzy with cubs,
you spook it into attacks you.

1719
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:19,850
What it's doing is neutralizing a 
threat.

1720
01:17:20,330 --> 01:17:23,720
So then the thinking is play dead,
get covered.

1721
01:17:23,721 --> 01:17:24,470
You know [inaudible] right.

1722
01:17:24,470 --> 01:17:26,330
Here's where,
here's where they're going to kill you.

1723
01:17:26,810 --> 01:17:29,180
You cover this and curl up and don't 
move.

1724
01:17:29,181 --> 01:17:31,700
And she's like,
take that bastard and walks off,

1725
01:17:32,410 --> 01:17:33,380
you know,
and again,

1726
01:17:33,410 --> 01:17:35,240
align,
they've aligned was to hit you.

1727
01:17:35,540 --> 01:17:40,540
You're supposed to just go ballistic on 
it because it's a predatory response 

1728
01:17:40,540 --> 01:17:41,300
that it's happened.
So when black bears,

1729
01:17:41,301 --> 01:17:46,301
like when you do hear of black bears,
when they attack the attack kids and 

1730
01:17:46,301 --> 01:17:51,251
you're like,
lions often attack like small women 

1731
01:17:51,251 --> 01:17:53,411
joggers,
like small women joggers seem to get 

1732
01:17:53,411 --> 01:17:53,411
attacked by lions or young kids need to 
get attacked by lions.

1733
01:17:53,411 --> 01:17:54,070
Yeah.
It's at that thing is like,

1734
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:56,470
I'm going to eat that,
you know?

1735
01:17:56,510 --> 01:17:58,320
Wow.
But then grizzlies enough people to man,

1736
01:17:58,321 --> 01:17:59,780
like you hear about people,
you know,

1737
01:17:59,790 --> 01:18:01,370
they,
they get at by bears.

1738
01:18:01,430 --> 01:18:02,840
Yeah.
There's a guy recently,

1739
01:18:02,841 --> 01:18:04,610
they think it was a hybrid.
I don't know what I'm saying.

1740
01:18:04,611 --> 01:18:05,890
Well,
there was a guy who was

1741
01:18:05,990 --> 01:18:09,310
minor and he went into get groceries in 
town.

1742
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:11,890
Apparently his boat died.
His engine dies.

1743
01:18:11,891 --> 01:18:15,350
So he pulled over and that's where they 
found his body.

1744
01:18:16,530 --> 01:18:18,710
It had been mostly consumed.

1745
01:18:19,510 --> 01:18:24,510
Yeah.
And they think they think that might've 

1746
01:18:24,510 --> 01:18:24,510
been a hybrid.

1747
01:18:24,510 --> 01:18:24,610
You know what's weird?
I was reading,

1748
01:18:24,611 --> 01:18:29,611
I was reading this book by,
I was reading this bear hunting book by 

1749
01:18:29,611 --> 01:18:29,611
this writer Tony Ross,
and

1750
01:18:31,110 --> 01:18:33,460
he's talking about with that,
like on Kodiak island,

1751
01:18:33,470 --> 01:18:38,470
like in the last couple of insulin areas
that just have really dense grizzly 

1752
01:18:38,470 --> 01:18:38,470
populations are brown bear grizzly.
The same thing.

1753
01:18:38,470 --> 01:18:41,020
Just people generally say like brown 
bear for Coastal Grizzlies,

1754
01:18:41,290 --> 01:18:43,030
grizzlies free anterior.
And um,

1755
01:18:43,630 --> 01:18:48,630
he was saying that the grizzlies,
that the male grizzlies will come out 

1756
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:50,200
and when they come out in those areas 
that have,

1757
01:18:50,230 --> 01:18:55,230
you know,
they'll may have like a grizzly for 

1758
01:18:55,230 --> 01:18:55,230
every one or two or three square miles.
So a lot,

1759
01:18:55,230 --> 01:18:57,160
a lot more dense than most other areas.
They'll come out and they,

1760
01:18:57,220 --> 01:18:58,990
when they come out in the spring,
they're heart and copes.

1761
01:18:59,860 --> 01:19:00,890
Wow.
That's like,

1762
01:19:00,970 --> 01:19:05,970
that's what's on the menu man.
Cause it's like there's so many of them 

1763
01:19:05,970 --> 01:19:10,040
there.
They're so vicious that they come out 

1764
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:12,570
and like they,
their primary food source for somebody 

1765
01:19:12,570 --> 01:19:13,990
mature boars is grizzly cubs.
Oh my God.

1766
01:19:13,991 --> 01:19:15,850
And you go after.
But he said a weird thing is,

1767
01:19:15,910 --> 01:19:20,910
and you know,
they'll kill those companies that we 

1768
01:19:20,910 --> 01:19:22,471
said in all of his hunting when,
when they'll kill a grizzly bear brown 

1769
01:19:22,471 --> 01:19:23,330
bear and skin it,
you know,

1770
01:19:23,470 --> 01:19:25,600
he said all these hunting,
he's talked to other guys too.

1771
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:31,080
He's never seen a.
he's never seen where brown bear 

1772
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:34,210
consumed the skin dot carcass up another
browser.

1773
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:37,540
So the cubs.
But they never read the bear.

1774
01:19:37,690 --> 01:19:39,310
And He,
and he mentions in his book,

1775
01:19:39,311 --> 01:19:41,200
he talks to some other people,
he's talking about some Galligan,

1776
01:19:41,230 --> 01:19:42,220
20 years of hunting,
whatever,

1777
01:19:42,510 --> 01:19:45,760
if they've never seen the carcass of an 
adult get cannibalized.

1778
01:19:46,150 --> 01:19:47,280
Wow.
But they'll,

1779
01:19:47,470 --> 01:19:51,550
they'll put down and it's like a,
it's like a active pray for them.

1780
01:19:51,730 --> 01:19:56,730
So when they're hunting the cubs,
do you think that it's a response to 

1781
01:19:56,730 --> 01:19:59,540
like controlling the environment,
not letting any new members in?

1782
01:19:59,820 --> 01:20:02,550
I think it's.
So I think it really is food,

1783
01:20:03,090 --> 01:20:04,700
but it's also that they know that,
that,

1784
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:06,990
that will go back into estrous because 
she's,

1785
01:20:07,050 --> 01:20:09,000
she's only gonna.
She's only going to put off.

1786
01:20:09,030 --> 01:20:11,400
She's only going to put off cuff maybe 
every few years.

1787
01:20:11,610 --> 01:20:14,310
Tyra dolphins do that as well.
Dolphins,

1788
01:20:14,311 --> 01:20:19,311
murder babies.
If they know that the woman she won't 

1789
01:20:19,311 --> 01:20:19,311
meet with,
uh,

1790
01:20:19,311 --> 01:20:23,700
with the dolphins that blue,
the blue whale drown.

1791
01:20:23,701 --> 01:20:24,390
Um,
you know,

1792
01:20:24,391 --> 01:20:27,990
they'll drown a female's calf because 
she knows she'll bring it again,

1793
01:20:27,991 --> 01:20:29,400
if not,
she's not brief for years.

1794
01:20:30,630 --> 01:20:35,630
It's rough man.
There's a lot of people that really try 

1795
01:20:35,630 --> 01:20:35,630
to like dress up the animal world as 
kind of like,

1796
01:20:35,630 --> 01:20:36,280
oh,
innocent this.

1797
01:20:36,390 --> 01:20:38,970
It's like there's some,
there's some wicked stuff out there,

1798
01:20:38,971 --> 01:20:40,410
but those,
those big bars,

1799
01:20:40,411 --> 01:20:42,600
he was talking about this dude Tony Rust
on with these big boards.

1800
01:20:42,601 --> 01:20:47,601
They'll go out and dig dens,
Jesus Christ and the females will come 

1801
01:20:47,601 --> 01:20:51,621
out later,
so the females being the Danza cubs and 

1802
01:20:51,621 --> 01:20:51,621
those boards will go around doing site 
visits.

1803
01:20:51,621 --> 01:20:56,180
No dig covered out.
Then you got in and I imagine they're 

1804
01:20:56,180 --> 01:21:00,590
probably a little bit indiscriminately.
There's a chance he's going to consume 

1805
01:21:00,590 --> 01:21:04,371
his own offspring.
She's also thinking that all these 

1806
01:21:04,371 --> 01:21:05,160
sounds that wouldn't be available to me 
for two years,

1807
01:21:05,161 --> 01:21:07,740
three years are going to be available to
meet this June.

1808
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:09,390
Oh,
June or July.

1809
01:21:09,391 --> 01:21:12,180
When they go to the females defend.
They have to,

1810
01:21:12,430 --> 01:21:14,760
you know,
they have to anyone life and I feel like

1811
01:21:14,770 --> 01:21:17,820
I've seen and also talk to you and her.
If people who talk about that,

1812
01:21:17,821 --> 01:21:20,820
they've seen instances where a female 
has fought them off.

1813
01:21:20,860 --> 01:21:22,680
Yeah,
we're the mail wasn't that committed,

1814
01:21:22,710 --> 01:21:24,570
you know,
because I mean it's going to come out.

1815
01:21:24,630 --> 01:21:26,910
It's going to come at a price to them,
but then some of these may.

1816
01:21:26,911 --> 01:21:31,911
I mean,
some of these males are so big that 

1817
01:21:31,911 --> 01:21:33,360
they're,
they can get off to be where there are 

1818
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:33,360
nearly twice as big in their battle.

1819
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:35,060
Hardened man.
Yeah.

1820
01:21:35,070 --> 01:21:37,620
This wicked though,
that movie grizzly man,

1821
01:21:37,890 --> 01:21:42,890
when those two bears go to war and they 
start to do things like unbelievable 

1822
01:21:42,890 --> 01:21:43,920
footage,
that guy got to tell you what.

1823
01:21:43,970 --> 01:21:46,800
That's some of the most impressive 
people are always down on that guy,

1824
01:21:46,801 --> 01:21:47,820
you know,
for all these reasons.

1825
01:21:47,821 --> 01:21:49,050
But I'll tell you what,
man,

1826
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:51,000
that dude's a hard camper.
Oh yeah,

1827
01:21:51,030 --> 01:21:56,030
you go do it because I play a foot heel 
out camp anybody and people in Alaska 

1828
01:21:57,060 --> 01:21:58,840
always like,
but people will ask,

1829
01:21:58,940 --> 01:22:03,940
get really offended when like an 
outsider will come up and do some like 

1830
01:22:03,940 --> 01:22:07,910
thing like go camping for a long time.
So like he gets eaten by bears and it 

1831
01:22:07,910 --> 01:22:07,910
was like,
oh,

1832
01:22:07,910 --> 01:22:11,301
he's so stupid.
But the guy knew he was going to eat my 

1833
01:22:11,301 --> 01:22:11,301
bears and he camped.
Everybody.

1834
01:22:11,301 --> 01:22:15,920
You go onto an area like that.
It just rained and he camped seven 

1835
01:22:16,291 --> 01:22:18,620
summers in a row all summer long and be 
like,

1836
01:22:18,630 --> 01:22:18,870
well yeah.

1837
01:22:18,870 --> 01:22:21,150
But he had his girlfriend with him that 
could make it worse,

1838
01:22:21,170 --> 01:22:25,740
man.
To be uncomfortable with your girlfriend

1839
01:22:26,090 --> 01:22:31,090
is,
is like worse than being uncomfortable 

1840
01:22:31,090 --> 01:22:33,381
by yourself.
Being uncomfortable for two people and 

1841
01:22:33,381 --> 01:22:33,630
there's a certain amount of 
responsibility that comes with that.

1842
01:22:34,010 --> 01:22:39,010
He was a hard.
Especially if you like her because 

1843
01:22:39,010 --> 01:22:39,010
you're just watching it crumble.
Yeah.

1844
01:22:39,010 --> 01:22:41,070
And he was a hard camper and he 
collected some footage.

1845
01:22:41,071 --> 01:22:43,680
That fight is unparalleled.
Unbelievable.

1846
01:22:43,681 --> 01:22:48,681
It's just amazing power in those two 
bars is just like they duked it out for 

1847
01:22:50,011 --> 01:22:55,011
quite a while.
He got like really close up footage for 

1848
01:22:55,011 --> 01:22:55,410
the folks who don't know what we're 
talking about are these two bears.

1849
01:22:55,411 --> 01:22:57,810
It's fighting over territory.
It's worth watching.

1850
01:22:57,811 --> 01:23:02,811
That movie alone is worth watching.
Grizzly man alone wash those boards go 

1851
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:02,970
at each other.
They devastate that area.

1852
01:23:03,150 --> 01:23:08,150
Yeah.
And that's not like a common thing to 

1853
01:23:08,150 --> 01:23:08,150
see like in that,

1854
01:23:08,150 --> 01:23:09,610
that close,
that good footage for that long.

1855
01:23:09,611 --> 01:23:11,440
It's a long ass fight.
I had a,

1856
01:23:11,441 --> 01:23:12,090
but I got like,

1857
01:23:12,530 --> 01:23:14,660
but like you can hang out in the woods 
so much,

1858
01:23:14,661 --> 01:23:19,661
you know,
and not you're getting out in the with 

1859
01:23:19,661 --> 01:23:20,240
so much.
And then when you look at all the things

1860
01:23:20,241 --> 01:23:22,360
you've seen out in the woods,
it's like,

1861
01:23:22,910 --> 01:23:27,080
it's startling.
Like how few really weird things.

1862
01:23:27,081 --> 01:23:28,400
You see,
what disproportionate,

1863
01:23:28,610 --> 01:23:29,890
you know,
no one does,

1864
01:23:29,891 --> 01:23:34,891
spends a little dinky bit of time out in
the woods and then sees tons of weird 

1865
01:23:34,891 --> 01:23:35,660
stuff.
It's like you got to put in the hours,

1866
01:23:35,870 --> 01:23:36,710
you know,
to,

1867
01:23:36,730 --> 01:23:37,070
to,
to,

1868
01:23:37,100 --> 01:23:39,280
to catalog stuff.
Like there's a guy,

1869
01:23:39,281 --> 01:23:41,450
I know this guy,
he's a Guy Jay Scott,

1870
01:23:41,451 --> 01:23:42,440
and we're talking.
I'll start one day,

1871
01:23:42,470 --> 01:23:44,930
like I was feeling cocky because I had 
seen three.

1872
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:46,550
I've seen three mountain lions,
wells hon,

1873
01:23:46,970 --> 01:23:48,410
you know,
and um,

1874
01:23:49,010 --> 01:23:54,010
was Guy Jay Scott just haunts.
He's one of the best big game hunters I 

1875
01:23:54,010 --> 01:23:54,010
know.
And I was saying like,

1876
01:23:54,010 --> 01:23:55,460
uh,
you ever seen a lion?

1877
01:23:55,540 --> 01:23:57,560
He said,
I'm looking for number 33 right now.

1878
01:23:57,920 --> 01:24:02,920
Oh Nash.
Not hunting lions that sitting in 

1879
01:24:02,920 --> 01:24:05,010
watching Jesus sending,
watching,

1880
01:24:05,610 --> 01:24:07,130
sitting in,
watching for game.

1881
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:09,770
He had,
he had logged 32 that he spotted,

1882
01:24:09,771 --> 01:24:10,770
not running them,
a dog,

1883
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:12,940
just being there in the woods,
watching,

1884
01:24:12,980 --> 01:24:15,050
looking for lines,
what is looking for game,

1885
01:24:15,051 --> 01:24:17,240
what has been oculars and that right 
there.

1886
01:24:17,241 --> 01:24:18,920
You can't buy it.
You can't.

1887
01:24:19,050 --> 01:24:20,900
Like.
He's a very honest guy.

1888
01:24:20,930 --> 01:24:22,580
That's like,
that means like,

1889
01:24:22,610 --> 01:24:24,470
oh,
that dude's spent tons of time out there

1890
01:24:24,740 --> 01:24:28,100
and some of the things that.
That guy that was in the footage,

1891
01:24:28,360 --> 01:24:30,050
and I'm only going by and on a grizzly 
man,

1892
01:24:30,051 --> 01:24:33,170
I don't want to go and buy whatever I 
saw on that to our herzog movie.

1893
01:24:33,430 --> 01:24:35,240
Like Lord knows how many things didn't 
make it.

1894
01:24:36,020 --> 01:24:37,070
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

1895
01:24:37,730 --> 01:24:40,100
He was out there and witnessed some 
amazing site.

1896
01:24:40,110 --> 01:24:41,080
Yes ma'am.
Yeah.

1897
01:24:41,081 --> 01:24:46,081
Well that's what people have to 
understand that the Timothy Treadwell's 

1898
01:24:46,081 --> 01:24:46,650
footage was all turned into this Werner 
Herzog documentary,

1899
01:24:46,651 --> 01:24:50,670
but this is just a piece of what this 
guy got when he was living up there,

1900
01:24:51,390 --> 01:24:56,390
and I think a lot of people believe that
they're going to so powerful.

1901
01:24:57,150 --> 01:25:01,220
The good Greco Greco,
good under good control and neck

1902
01:25:02,980 --> 01:25:06,070
that this guy had suicide by bear.
That was the way he went out,

1903
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:09,250
that he knew that if he was there as 
late as he was,

1904
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:13,030
that the bears that would still be 
around would be really desperate.

1905
01:25:13,090 --> 01:25:18,090
There were older bears on you.
Imagine one of those things getting old 

1906
01:25:18,090 --> 01:25:18,090
you.
Yeah.

1907
01:25:18,090 --> 01:25:18,090
Power man.
Oh yeah.

1908
01:25:18,090 --> 01:25:20,750
They're going to town and they use it in
real Jujitsu.

1909
01:25:20,810 --> 01:25:23,050
Look at this.
He's passing the guard.

1910
01:25:23,080 --> 01:25:24,460
Look,
it's filled in the hips.

1911
01:25:24,490 --> 01:25:25,970
That's.
Guy's got a good open garden.

1912
01:25:26,100 --> 01:25:27,040
Not.
I don't know.

1913
01:25:27,041 --> 01:25:30,100
It's not unreasonable to say it.
Those are 800 pound plus animals.

1914
01:25:30,580 --> 01:25:31,870
Oh yeah.
Those are enormous.

1915
01:25:32,930 --> 01:25:35,260
I mean we don't.
It's hard to put it in perspective,

1916
01:25:35,261 --> 01:25:36,640
but that's good.
Jujitsu,

1917
01:25:36,641 --> 01:25:38,230
I'll tell you that.
He's inside control right now.

1918
01:25:38,730 --> 01:25:41,950
He just passed the guard.
He's in full sight control right now and

1919
01:25:41,951 --> 01:25:46,951
he's got the neck and he could deliver 
knees to the head if that was allowed 

1920
01:25:46,951 --> 01:25:46,951
and bear fighting,
but it doesn't see like that.

1921
01:25:46,951 --> 01:25:48,380
See that move,
that move.

1922
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:53,920
Reclaimed Guard got down.
That is natural reclaimed guard.

1923
01:25:54,250 --> 01:25:59,250
He reclaimed guard.
You can't let him get back to guard 

1924
01:25:59,250 --> 01:26:02,461
against this.
Bear is fucking crafty to bear on the 

1925
01:26:02,461 --> 01:26:02,461
bottom is doing a real good job 
defending himself.

1926
01:26:02,461 --> 01:26:04,130
This for real,
even though the other barrier is bigger.

1927
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:07,730
This what's going on there.
The way the bear fight is how they teach

1928
01:26:07,731 --> 01:26:10,040
you to fight in Jujitsu,
for real foot on the hips,

1929
01:26:10,100 --> 01:26:12,590
controlling his body out,
letting him get all of his weight on top

1930
01:26:12,591 --> 01:26:17,591
of you.
Shifting your hips so your feet touch 

1931
01:26:17,591 --> 01:26:17,591
onto his hip.

1932
01:26:17,591 --> 01:26:20,710
You see the chunks of hair flying.
Here's an interesting bit of like 

1933
01:26:20,710 --> 01:26:20,710
bipedalism in this too,
man.

1934
01:26:20,710 --> 01:26:22,030
Like they're pretty adept at another 
bank.

1935
01:26:22,150 --> 01:26:23,760
You know they're pretty adept at being 
under back

1936
01:26:24,700 --> 01:26:25,250
looking at.
Well,

1937
01:26:25,251 --> 01:26:27,770
when you see him standing up like that 
on their hind legs,

1938
01:26:27,771 --> 01:26:30,200
that's when you realize how fucking 
enormous they are.

1939
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:33,110
Look at the big chunk of hair missing 
from his back leg,

1940
01:26:34,010 --> 01:26:39,010
an arm drag.
Look at the size of the fucking light 

1941
01:26:39,010 --> 01:26:39,020
one.
Look how big the light.

1942
01:26:39,080 --> 01:26:42,500
When his youngest check him out.
He's been back down to the younger ones.

1943
01:26:42,501 --> 01:26:44,810
Got Better Jujitsu,
I told you,

1944
01:26:44,840 --> 01:26:47,570
fight off his back.
It might be old and crippled.

1945
01:26:47,571 --> 01:26:48,920
Man,
he wore out the big deal,

1946
01:26:49,770 --> 01:26:51,320
the big deal,
got tired of the big one,

1947
01:26:51,321 --> 01:26:53,200
had a pipe,
had hold of his face though

1948
01:26:56,960 --> 01:27:01,960
these are blackberries when I'm 
principles on where my brothers and I 

1949
01:27:01,960 --> 01:27:02,040
got a little shack,
the biggest bear I've seen out there,

1950
01:27:02,860 --> 01:27:05,640
and that's famous for big barriers.
The biggest barrier I see now.

1951
01:27:05,641 --> 01:27:08,430
There was a big injured old bear on what
happened,

1952
01:27:08,431 --> 01:27:13,431
but he was just packing leg and he was 
kind of in the autumn of is in the 

1953
01:27:13,431 --> 01:27:13,650
autumn of his career,
you know,

1954
01:27:13,830 --> 01:27:18,830
so he had been like probably the man and
now he probably just kiss his ass 

1955
01:27:18,830 --> 01:27:18,830
kicked.
Wow.

1956
01:27:19,020 --> 01:27:24,020
He's sees guy.
He's done by a salmon stream that 

1957
01:27:24,020 --> 01:27:26,330
couldn't really move and you can imagine
now all the people he'd beat up because 

1958
01:27:26,330 --> 01:27:26,330
he,
he could be old now.

1959
01:27:26,330 --> 01:27:28,230
17 one time.
17.

1960
01:27:28,770 --> 01:27:31,980
That's from Duluth to tooth tooth 
dentist analysis.

1961
01:27:32,010 --> 01:27:32,760
17.
He could,

1962
01:27:32,790 --> 01:27:37,790
you know,
he could have a lot of grudges against 

1963
01:27:37,790 --> 01:27:40,751
him.
Now he's kind of down one of the big 

1964
01:27:40,751 --> 01:27:40,751
board or one of the cool things.
Yeah.

1965
01:27:40,751 --> 01:27:42,340
About the trip that we went on.
We should probably talk about that.

1966
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:46,930
We're talking about everything else,
but what the fuck?

1967
01:27:46,931 --> 01:27:47,560
Yeah.
Go Pee.

1968
01:27:47,650 --> 01:27:49,150
Go Pee.
And when you come back we'll uh,

1969
01:27:49,570 --> 01:27:52,780
we'll talk to you about,
about hunting and manly shit.

1970
01:27:52,810 --> 01:27:54,190
Yeah.
You're allowed to say pee on the show.

1971
01:27:54,340 --> 01:27:57,870
The show is casual as fuck.
Don't have to worry about saying p.

1972
01:27:58,540 --> 01:27:59,560
what'd you do this weekend,
pal?

1973
01:28:00,430 --> 01:28:01,840
Uh,
what did I do this weekend?

1974
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:03,680
Um,
I dunno.

1975
01:28:03,730 --> 01:28:05,740
I just watched the playoffs and I 
watched nate's fight.

1976
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:09,220
Safford and fought a great fight,
man.

1977
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:10,480
It was a good fight.
The whole,

1978
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:13,090
the whole card was good.
Asked me to tell Josh Barnett.

1979
01:28:13,091 --> 01:28:14,210
Got a big win.
Yeah,

1980
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:15,030
yeah,
yeah.

1981
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:16,900
Josh Barnett is tough.
He's an animal.

1982
01:28:17,690 --> 01:28:19,930
It's good.
A good wood for him because he was sick.

1983
01:28:20,140 --> 01:28:20,620
He,
uh,

1984
01:28:20,650 --> 01:28:22,960
he had like a real tough camp.
Apparently there was a,

1985
01:28:23,010 --> 01:28:25,720
like you've got a real bad flu or some 
sort of a bug,

1986
01:28:25,721 --> 01:28:26,080
something,
you know,

1987
01:28:26,130 --> 01:28:28,300
some kind of a cold and could not shake 
it.

1988
01:28:28,590 --> 01:28:33,590
He said he only had a few days of good 
solid hard training during the entire 

1989
01:28:33,590 --> 01:28:35,200
camp or certainly like just fucking half
ass it or trying to,

1990
01:28:35,201 --> 01:28:36,760
uh,
do his bass,

1991
01:28:36,761 --> 01:28:41,761
but try not to get sicker.
It's interesting to see like where MMA 

1992
01:28:41,761 --> 01:28:43,040
is coming because like if you're not 
prepared for someone's,

1993
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:44,500
you know,
weapons,

1994
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:47,290
and if someone hits you with something 
you haven't seen before,

1995
01:28:47,650 --> 01:28:52,650
like I was thinking about naked and get 
caught with those leg kicks over number 

1996
01:28:52,650 --> 01:28:54,910
eight and 18 million times.
I think terex happening is a,

1997
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:59,890
he's a really classical technical 
striker and it nate Marquardt,

1998
01:29:00,370 --> 01:29:02,250
although a amazing

1999
01:29:02,250 --> 01:29:07,250
striker,
you though the knockout of Tyron 

2000
01:29:07,250 --> 01:29:07,250
Woodley,
that,

2001
01:29:07,250 --> 01:29:10,191
uh,
that sent that insane dot Kao towards 

2002
01:29:10,191 --> 01:29:11,910
the end.
But I think that technically if you look

2003
01:29:11,911 --> 01:29:14,760
at all the best technical fighters in 
less,

2004
01:29:14,761 --> 01:29:19,761
they're freaks of athleticism unless 
they're just much faster than anyone 

2005
01:29:19,761 --> 01:29:19,761
else.
They,

2006
01:29:19,761 --> 01:29:24,450
they follow a certain number of rules 
when it comes to defending yourself when

2007
01:29:24,451 --> 01:29:27,840
it comes to carrying your hands.
When it comes to how you fight.

2008
01:29:28,110 --> 01:29:31,770
And I'm one of them is you've got to 
respect everyone's techniques.

2009
01:29:31,830 --> 01:29:36,830
So you got to respect,
like kicks you gotta check leg kicks 

2010
01:29:36,830 --> 01:29:37,860
whenever possible and I think the idea 
is that,

2011
01:29:37,861 --> 01:29:42,861
you know,
nate was going to eat a few of 'em and 

2012
01:29:42,861 --> 01:29:43,770
just tag them with a big punch.
That sub strategy that works.

2013
01:29:43,830 --> 01:29:46,080
So there's no.
Tim Silvia,

2014
01:29:46,260 --> 01:29:49,340
Tim Silvia knocked out Rigo Rodriguez 
the same way.

2015
01:29:49,380 --> 01:29:51,990
Rico Rico hit him with a leg kick and he
was planted take,

2016
01:29:51,991 --> 01:29:55,650
he decided he just gonna eat the it and 
blast the punch and catch a guy.

2017
01:29:55,650 --> 01:29:58,560
So a lot of guys do that and it got like
Marco who's got that kind of power,

2018
01:29:58,860 --> 01:30:02,830
probably banked on that.
And then somewhere along the line safdie

2019
01:30:02,831 --> 01:30:04,440
and hit them with too many of them.
And he was like,

2020
01:30:04,441 --> 01:30:06,390
Oh fuck,
I should have checked those.

2021
01:30:06,410 --> 01:30:11,410
Right?
So it's just a matter of absolutely 

2022
01:30:11,410 --> 01:30:11,910
could and he might be able to beat 70 
when they fight again.

2023
01:30:11,911 --> 01:30:12,480
You know,
it's like,

2024
01:30:12,910 --> 01:30:15,720
it's when you get,
when you're dealing with that level,

2025
01:30:15,780 --> 01:30:16,480
you know,
that high,

2026
01:30:16,481 --> 01:30:20,240
a level of fighting terex happening.
It's a lot of times what it is is a,

2027
01:30:20,310 --> 01:30:25,310
it's also how they match.
Giles is a really good wrestler because 

2028
01:30:25,310 --> 01:30:28,581
it was time with team quest like he's 
really hard to take doing Greco with 

2029
01:30:28,581 --> 01:30:28,581
Olympia and it's like.
Exactly.

2030
01:30:28,581 --> 01:30:31,560
So you saw like when nate was really 
struggling to take them down to nate was

2031
01:30:31,561 --> 01:30:36,561
forced to stand with them and he was 
forced to stand with them and 17 is 

2032
01:30:36,561 --> 01:30:40,040
being more conservative and he's being 
more tactical until he kept landing 

2033
01:30:40,040 --> 01:30:43,911
those leg kicks and neighbors looking 
for the big bombs and Woodley fonts 

2034
01:30:43,911 --> 01:30:43,911
happening.

2035
01:30:43,911 --> 01:30:45,980
He just hit him with those low doubles 
and singles wrestle.

2036
01:30:46,030 --> 01:30:51,030
Fuck them.
One thing they say when they say that 

2037
01:30:51,030 --> 01:30:54,380
crack,
Greco guys have a tough time with 

2038
01:30:54,380 --> 01:30:54,380
freestyle wrestlers.
Oh yeah.

2039
01:30:54,380 --> 01:30:55,110
Well a lot of people have a hard time 
with a guy like tyron woodley.

2040
01:30:55,111 --> 01:31:00,111
He's just a fucking.
He's a super strong dude with great 

2041
01:31:00,111 --> 01:31:00,640
wrestling fan,
you know,

2042
01:31:00,690 --> 01:31:02,640
and he's in condition.
Any smart,

2043
01:31:02,670 --> 01:31:03,220
you know,
anywhere,

2044
01:31:03,270 --> 01:31:07,140
trains hard and it's a fucking super 
athlete and he can punch the shit out.

2045
01:31:07,160 --> 01:31:08,850
His wrestling's ridiculous.
He gets a hold of you.

2046
01:31:08,851 --> 01:31:09,960
You're going to go on your back,
you know,

2047
01:31:09,970 --> 01:31:11,070
it's a big,
strong guy,

2048
01:31:11,071 --> 01:31:13,350
but nate beat him and that was probably 
the most sensational.

2049
01:31:13,351 --> 01:31:18,351
They look so to go from that fight where
he looks unbelievably good to this 

2050
01:31:18,351 --> 01:31:18,630
fight,
just a little wake up call,

2051
01:31:18,750 --> 01:31:23,750
she would just be more,
a little bit more tactical or 

2052
01:31:23,750 --> 01:31:26,121
conservative when you're fighting guy 
like that and to realize that that kind 

2053
01:31:26,121 --> 01:31:29,091
of accumulation of eating,
those kind of shots really can pay off 

2054
01:31:29,091 --> 01:31:29,091
or can can,
you know,

2055
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:31,020
it tends to maybe nate,
I don't know,

2056
01:31:31,021 --> 01:31:36,021
but maybe I wonder if nate felt he was 
bigger and stronger so he could call 

2057
01:31:36,021 --> 01:31:36,021
them.

2058
01:31:36,021 --> 01:31:39,890
Probably did.
He probably thought he would just blast 

2059
01:31:39,890 --> 01:31:39,890
them.
Look after that Woodley fight,

2060
01:31:39,890 --> 01:31:44,001
man.
I mean he knew it was gonna be a tough 

2061
01:31:44,001 --> 01:31:44,001
fight.
He can do.

2062
01:31:44,001 --> 01:31:44,001
A lot of people said it was a gigantic 
upset.

2063
01:31:44,250 --> 01:31:45,660
I don't think it was a gigantic or 
upset.

2064
01:31:45,661 --> 01:31:46,330
I thought.
I thought.

2065
01:31:46,440 --> 01:31:48,750
I think it was terex afternoons finance 
performance,

2066
01:31:48,751 --> 01:31:51,030
but it wasn't like a gigantic upset.
It was an upset.

2067
01:31:51,330 --> 01:31:56,330
I think it would.
I would see the taffy into extra and 

2068
01:31:56,330 --> 01:31:56,330
stryker.
I said a great fighter.

2069
01:31:56,330 --> 01:31:59,200
He's a complete fighter.
He realized it's potential that night,

2070
01:31:59,370 --> 01:32:00,010
you know?
Yeah.

2071
01:32:00,310 --> 01:32:00,760
But,
um,

2072
01:32:00,850 --> 01:32:02,860
back to what I wanted to tell you about 
our trip,

2073
01:32:02,861 --> 01:32:05,050
man.
And thanks for bringing my skull.

2074
01:32:05,640 --> 01:32:06,970
Thank Ryan Callahan.
Man.

2075
01:32:07,450 --> 01:32:12,450
I love that dude.
Callahan was one of the guys that we 

2076
01:32:12,450 --> 01:32:12,450
went with,
a real man.

2077
01:32:12,450 --> 01:32:13,960
He saw it through.
He's such an awesome dude.

2078
01:32:14,490 --> 01:32:16,090
Um,
the um,

2079
01:32:16,840 --> 01:32:18,730
the place where we went for,
uh,

2080
01:32:18,850 --> 01:32:23,850
for dinner when we first came back.
We haven't even showered yet and we 

2081
01:32:23,850 --> 01:32:26,950
stunk five.
If you need a great hunting guide,

2082
01:32:27,010 --> 01:32:28,720
right?
Call Ryan Callahan.

2083
01:32:28,780 --> 01:32:30,490
We were out in the,
you know,

2084
01:32:30,700 --> 01:32:33,280
camping by the side of the river for 
five days.

2085
01:32:33,281 --> 01:32:36,520
We hadn't had any showers.
And then before we even got to a hotel,

2086
01:32:36,521 --> 01:32:39,550
we decided let's go get some dinner 
somewhere or get some lunch.

2087
01:32:39,551 --> 01:32:43,990
So we go to this place in this fucking 
Dick Wad who owns the place,

2088
01:32:43,991 --> 01:32:47,860
has this shrine up to the fallen 
marines.

2089
01:32:47,861 --> 01:32:50,790
And he comes up to us and starts talking
to us about Obama.

2090
01:32:50,791 --> 01:32:53,310
And Are you guys the attack?
Yeah.

2091
01:32:53,430 --> 01:32:55,000
Oh,
they killed my boys.

2092
01:32:55,001 --> 01:32:58,280
He's just as overbearing,
blowhards a real a whole,

2093
01:32:58,330 --> 01:33:03,330
and then he starts yelling at his staff 
and he starts yelling at a woman who 

2094
01:33:03,330 --> 01:33:03,330
works there and what.

2095
01:33:03,330 --> 01:33:05,440
It's just like dressing or down for no 
reason.

2096
01:33:05,441 --> 01:33:10,441
It's just really embarrassing to.
All of us are down over order confusion 

2097
01:33:10,441 --> 01:33:12,700
that we created by having like a 
complicated order.

2098
01:33:12,790 --> 01:33:17,790
Yeah.
And it wasn't anything that any of us 

2099
01:33:17,790 --> 01:33:17,790
had any problem with at all.
It was just like,

2100
01:33:17,790 --> 01:33:17,860
oh no.
Oh no worries.

2101
01:33:17,861 --> 01:33:18,580
You know,
every,

2102
01:33:18,590 --> 01:33:23,590
everybody was fine,
but this guy is treating her like she 

2103
01:33:23,590 --> 01:33:23,670
just took a shit in the middle of your 
fucking chicken soup.

2104
01:33:23,680 --> 01:33:24,920
It didn't make any sense.
Right.

2105
01:33:25,270 --> 01:33:28,030
So Ryan,
at the end of the dinner,

2106
01:33:28,240 --> 01:33:33,240
he gets up and he goes over to the guy 
and he starts calling the better 

2107
01:33:33,240 --> 01:33:35,110
business bureau on the phone and he 
tells the woman,

2108
01:33:35,140 --> 01:33:36,640
quit,
you need to quit.

2109
01:33:36,850 --> 01:33:39,430
You may not work here.
Just get out and quit right now.

2110
01:33:39,431 --> 01:33:42,100
And he goes,
you sir are an embarrassment.

2111
01:33:42,280 --> 01:33:47,280
You know,
I'm a native Montana and I have some 

2112
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:49,081
people in here.
I'm showing them what Montana is alike 

2113
01:33:49,081 --> 01:33:49,870
and they have to see you exhibit this 
kind of behavior.

2114
01:33:50,650 --> 01:33:51,970
Wow.
That's a John Wayne.

2115
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:53,380
John Wayne.
Man.

2116
01:33:53,381 --> 01:33:58,381
He was sitting there.
He defended that girl was embarrassed 

2117
01:33:58,381 --> 01:33:59,560
for his age.
He started trying to talk and he goes,

2118
01:33:59,561 --> 01:34:04,561
I am not talking to you sir,
but I cannot understand for the life me 

2119
01:34:04,561 --> 01:34:04,570
why you would speak to somebody like 
that.

2120
01:34:04,571 --> 01:34:07,600
I just can't understand.
And Ryan Ryan is Ryan,

2121
01:34:07,601 --> 01:34:09,060
so polite,
but you can tell he's a,

2122
01:34:09,130 --> 01:34:12,730
he's,
he's such a moral upstanding guy.

2123
01:34:12,850 --> 01:34:15,640
Like he's just this great guy with a 
mustache,

2124
01:34:15,790 --> 01:34:17,980
you know,
just stand there like just just standing

2125
01:34:17,981 --> 01:34:20,500
up for what's right.
And it Kinda like shamed all of us.

2126
01:34:20,501 --> 01:34:21,010
We were like,
God,

2127
01:34:21,011 --> 01:34:22,600
I guess we should have done that for 
like,

2128
01:34:23,380 --> 01:34:24,250
I'm not good at that

2129
01:34:24,270 --> 01:34:25,290
because I,
I,

2130
01:34:25,590 --> 01:34:27,620
I,
that Guy Matt made me mad.

2131
01:34:27,640 --> 01:34:28,190
You know,
the way.

2132
01:34:31,240 --> 01:34:33,440
It's almost like he's trying to sabotage
his own restaurant.

2133
01:34:33,470 --> 01:34:35,150
It was the weirdest thing to have.
They'd be like,

2134
01:34:35,480 --> 01:34:40,480
I'm going to go into your restaurant and
buy the products you're selling and 

2135
01:34:40,480 --> 01:34:42,110
you're going to come start like quizzing
me into things that I know are traps.

2136
01:34:42,700 --> 01:34:43,820
Yeah.
You know,

2137
01:34:43,910 --> 01:34:47,130
basically we were like al Qaeda.
He was asking.

2138
01:34:47,220 --> 01:34:52,220
He was asking us how we felt about Obama
because it was right before the 

2139
01:34:52,220 --> 01:34:52,220
elections.
He was like,

2140
01:34:52,220 --> 01:34:52,220
yeah,
you're not,

2141
01:34:52,220 --> 01:34:54,110
you're not voting for Obama.
Right?

2142
01:34:54,330 --> 01:34:55,040
Yeah.
But in his,

2143
01:34:55,041 --> 01:34:58,190
his political,
his political was this,

2144
01:34:58,440 --> 01:35:00,970
oh,
you're going to boat go barbara.

2145
01:35:00,971 --> 01:35:05,971
You're going to get.
He started dancing around like I guess 

2146
01:35:05,971 --> 01:35:07,900
Obama's gay or some stereotypical,
like it was the weirdest thing.

2147
01:35:07,910 --> 01:35:08,970
Or if she fucking with

2148
01:35:10,110 --> 01:35:13,600
like I hate when anyone makes um,
like,

2149
01:35:13,620 --> 01:35:17,810
like when people come up just uninvited 
to like talk political makeup,

2150
01:35:17,970 --> 01:35:20,010
political insinuations.
I remember when we had our kid,

2151
01:35:20,011 --> 01:35:24,180
we had to get a pediatrician.
I remember going to guy who like started

2152
01:35:24,181 --> 01:35:26,390
making cracks like this,
assuming like Kinda like,

2153
01:35:26,660 --> 01:35:29,100
like that were in the club,
like one of the left wing club.

2154
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:34,520
Like he just knew that we were like in 
left when Columbus started making like 

2155
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:35,040
cracks about like right wing people.
I remember walking out,

2156
01:35:35,041 --> 01:35:40,041
I'm like,
there's no annotate my kid to a 

2157
01:35:40,041 --> 01:35:40,041
pediatrician who when I walk in I want 
to talk about my child's health once you

2158
01:35:40,041 --> 01:35:44,981
get into it with me and like make 
assumptions about my politics has 

2159
01:35:44,981 --> 01:35:47,961
nothing to do with the services that I'm
seeking and when I wanted to eat that 

2160
01:35:47,961 --> 01:35:50,841
guy's hamburger,
the last thing I wanted to hear was his 

2161
01:35:50,841 --> 01:35:50,841
like analysis of,
I think it was like the Ben Gazi

2162
01:35:51,330 --> 01:35:54,130
duck boat.
He said he tried to talk to you.

2163
01:35:54,210 --> 01:35:59,210
You talk about Joe.
I was messing with the guys that you 

2164
01:35:59,961 --> 01:36:00,930
guys got drunk.
I was like,

2165
01:36:00,940 --> 01:36:01,890
Nah,
just a little blow.

2166
01:36:01,900 --> 01:36:04,550
And he's like smart ass and Joe Joe 
Finance.

2167
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:05,710
I was like,
I stopped talking to that guy.

2168
01:36:05,711 --> 01:36:07,990
You're encouraging them.
I don't because I can tell when you clam

2169
01:36:07,991 --> 01:36:09,070
up.
I don't.

2170
01:36:09,110 --> 01:36:10,060
I,
yeah,

2171
01:36:10,061 --> 01:36:12,100
I didn't like that guy.
It wasn't nice.

2172
01:36:12,170 --> 01:36:14,980
When you see a guy who's not nice to his
employees like that,

2173
01:36:14,981 --> 01:36:16,210
I don't.
I really don't want to talk to them,

2174
01:36:16,570 --> 01:36:21,530
but the upside is that Ryan has,
is fuck that.

2175
01:36:21,650 --> 01:36:23,170
Uh,
that was a fun experience,

2176
01:36:23,171 --> 01:36:23,860
man,
to,

2177
01:36:23,861 --> 01:36:28,861
uh,
to have our first hunting trip with you 

2178
01:36:28,861 --> 01:36:28,870
was a,
was a real treat man.

2179
01:36:28,871 --> 01:36:31,160
It was so much fucking fun.
We keep telling you that.

2180
01:36:31,170 --> 01:36:33,760
I love seeing it through.
I love seeing people's eyes,

2181
01:36:33,761 --> 01:36:35,470
you know,
that's got to be weird for you.

2182
01:36:35,471 --> 01:36:35,950
Right?
I mean,

2183
01:36:35,951 --> 01:36:38,500
you've spent your entire life 
essentially hunting.

2184
01:36:38,501 --> 01:36:41,320
You can't even remember the first time 
you killed anything,

2185
01:36:41,321 --> 01:36:41,590
right?

2186
01:36:41,940 --> 01:36:42,630
No,
I don't.

2187
01:36:42,660 --> 01:36:44,280
Well,
I remember the first day,

2188
01:36:44,320 --> 01:36:49,320
I remember the first deer I killed,
but as far as hunting small game and 

2189
01:36:49,320 --> 01:36:49,320
just be around it,
you know what?

2190
01:36:49,320 --> 01:36:49,440
I never,
you know,

2191
01:36:49,441 --> 01:36:54,441
what I never had is uh,
not that I read or seen in other people,

2192
01:36:54,871 --> 01:36:56,820
whatever had that.
Like the shock of death that people,

2193
01:36:56,821 --> 01:36:58,010
you know what I mean?
The,

2194
01:36:58,090 --> 01:37:00,130
the people experience kind of like the,
the,

2195
01:37:00,131 --> 01:37:01,860
the shock of how serious it is.

2196
01:37:01,990 --> 01:37:04,360
So if someone grows the business arm.
Yeah.

2197
01:37:04,370 --> 01:37:06,100
And they see that all the time,
don't have it,

2198
01:37:06,101 --> 01:37:06,360
you know,

2199
01:37:07,090 --> 01:37:09,620
I didn't grow up on it.
I didn't grow up in agriculture but grew

2200
01:37:09,621 --> 01:37:11,660
up in Boston hunting and it was around a
lot of things.

2201
01:37:11,661 --> 01:37:14,400
But I never had that like that,
that level of surprise.

2202
01:37:14,401 --> 01:37:16,910
And I think that when you,
when you take someone out,

2203
01:37:17,350 --> 01:37:22,350
um,
for the first time in my brother's 

2204
01:37:22,350 --> 01:37:26,950
opponent,
the same thing with their wives or 

2205
01:37:26,950 --> 01:37:26,950
girlfriends out or friends out that 
there is,

2206
01:37:26,950 --> 01:37:28,640
that there's a real reckoning that 
people have,

2207
01:37:28,641 --> 01:37:29,630
you know.
And um,

2208
01:37:30,080 --> 01:37:35,080
the funny thing is,
despite someone's response that usually 

2209
01:37:35,080 --> 01:37:35,080
people,
if you,

2210
01:37:35,080 --> 01:37:39,190
if you kill an animal for the first time
and you're going to eat it regardless 

2211
01:37:39,190 --> 01:37:39,290
what you can do with kill,
killing animals for the first time,

2212
01:37:40,160 --> 01:37:41,390
it struck.
It's not,

2213
01:37:41,391 --> 01:37:44,420
I don't want to say it's humbling,
but it stops other thoughts.

2214
01:37:44,810 --> 01:37:49,810
You just,
your loan with that thought for a 

2215
01:37:49,810 --> 01:37:49,810
minute.
But the interesting thing is,

2216
01:37:49,810 --> 01:37:54,431
as much as I've seen that happen,
I've never had anyone later come to 

2217
01:37:54,990 --> 01:37:59,990
regret having done it.
I had weeds in some way strengthening 

2218
01:37:59,990 --> 01:38:00,900
for people to go to go see that like 
that.

2219
01:38:00,920 --> 01:38:02,940
That template gives you more relief.
That desk thing.

2220
01:38:02,941 --> 01:38:05,370
No one's ever called me back and said 
that was a terrible mistake

2221
01:38:05,410 --> 01:38:10,410
for you.
I'm intellectually intellectually 

2222
01:38:10,410 --> 01:38:11,650
knowing that this is a unique experience
for most people.

2223
01:38:11,890 --> 01:38:16,890
How do you know,
how does that make you feel like when 

2224
01:38:16,890 --> 01:38:19,150
you see it through their eyes and the,
the idea to you being so alien?

2225
01:38:20,940 --> 01:38:23,400
It's,
it's exciting for me and I'm,

2226
01:38:25,030 --> 01:38:25,630
I think that

2227
01:38:26,760 --> 01:38:31,760
I'm looking at.
I think that I already kind of in a way 

2228
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:34,551
I know what the,
what the experience is going to be for 

2229
01:38:34,551 --> 01:38:38,631
the person because I think in some ways 
we're talking about really base aspects 

2230
01:38:38,740 --> 01:38:40,470
of human nature,
you know,

2231
01:38:41,070 --> 01:38:46,070
and so I kind of can anticipate like if 
I take someone out on their first hunt 

2232
01:38:46,070 --> 01:38:46,070
and just kind of want to show him 
hunting first,

2233
01:38:46,920 --> 01:38:48,480
what I usually do,
you know,

2234
01:38:48,670 --> 01:38:53,670
because like I respect you guys might 
have a good time and respect your 

2235
01:38:53,670 --> 01:38:53,770
opinions on things.
So I'm like wanting to like taking on an

2236
01:38:53,771 --> 01:38:54,510
experience.
It's gonna.

2237
01:38:54,710 --> 01:38:56,640
It's gonna be a good one,
you know,

2238
01:38:56,641 --> 01:38:58,590
there's going to be like an immersive 
kind of experience,

2239
01:38:58,860 --> 01:39:03,860
so I know that there's a certain thing 
that goes with that just to kind of get 

2240
01:39:03,860 --> 01:39:06,981
away from stuff and be out in an area 
where you've diminished some of the 

2241
01:39:06,981 --> 01:39:07,020
noise and you're allowed to be in the 
moment.

2242
01:39:07,320 --> 01:39:08,940
It's just going to put you in a certain 
spot

2243
01:39:09,490 --> 01:39:10,840
and I think that that

2244
01:39:11,830 --> 01:39:13,630
it's like to take someone on a first 
hunt.

2245
01:39:14,740 --> 01:39:19,740
I'm not worried about like a wild card 
scenario because I've done it enough to 

2246
01:39:19,740 --> 01:39:21,070
where I've seen that it just doesn't 
happen.

2247
01:39:21,071 --> 01:39:26,071
It's like people go on a,
on a kind of predictable journey on a 

2248
01:39:26,071 --> 01:39:27,060
hunt.
You tell them a wild card.

2249
01:39:27,130 --> 01:39:32,130
I you have some crazy response to that 
would be like really unhinging for them 

2250
01:39:32,261 --> 01:39:35,140
or that it would,
that it would put them into the.

2251
01:39:35,150 --> 01:39:37,780
They would be so depressed or that there
would be so guilt ridden.

2252
01:39:38,110 --> 01:39:39,430
I've just never had,
you know,

2253
01:39:39,431 --> 01:39:41,050
it's not like when I go into it I don't 
think like,

2254
01:39:41,051 --> 01:39:46,051
wow,
who knows what's going to happen when 

2255
01:39:46,051 --> 01:39:46,051
this happens.
I'm saying like,

2256
01:39:46,051 --> 01:39:47,440
you know,
what's going to happen is the person who

2257
01:39:47,441 --> 01:39:49,690
have a very fulfilling experience,
you know,

2258
01:39:49,720 --> 01:39:51,460
and they're going to appreciate the 
challenge.

2259
01:39:51,490 --> 01:39:55,360
They might not ever go hunting again,
but they'll always remember back on that

2260
01:39:55,500 --> 01:40:00,500
and have come away and found out 
something about themselves and it's 

2261
01:40:00,500 --> 01:40:00,500
like,
it's never been otherwise.

2262
01:40:00,500 --> 01:40:00,900
If I,
if I,

2263
01:40:00,940 --> 01:40:04,300
I would probably stop if I found that 
there was a high degree,

2264
01:40:04,530 --> 01:40:04,910
you know,
there's,

2265
01:40:04,990 --> 01:40:08,120
there's a thing that happened to me 
though with,

2266
01:40:08,150 --> 01:40:09,040
with my own wife.

2267
01:40:10,990 --> 01:40:12,940
She didn't grow up around hunting,
you know,

2268
01:40:13,570 --> 01:40:18,570
and she eats a lot of wild game and has 
eaten a lot of wild game since ever 

2269
01:40:18,570 --> 01:40:20,920
since she eats more while gaining the 90
percent of the hunters I know,

2270
01:40:21,610 --> 01:40:22,690
but she just hadn't had.
She's like,

2271
01:40:22,691 --> 01:40:27,691
I don't want to see an animal.
I don't need to see an animal get 

2272
01:40:27,691 --> 01:40:27,691
killed.
She's like,

2273
01:40:27,691 --> 01:40:29,490
I'm fine with the hypocrisy if you want 
to call it that piracy.

2274
01:40:29,500 --> 01:40:30,730
I'll eat wild game.
I'll eat meat.

2275
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:32,680
I prefer to eat wild game over domestic 
meat.

2276
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:34,960
I just don't want to see you dear.
You're killed in one day.

2277
01:40:34,961 --> 01:40:38,110
I invited her,
we were up at my cabin and I invited her

2278
01:40:38,111 --> 01:40:42,820
out on a deer hunt with us and my 
brother wanted to get a deer.

2279
01:40:42,990 --> 01:40:47,990
We took our boat out and landed our 
skiff at this river mouth and she was 

2280
01:40:47,990 --> 01:40:51,061
reluctant to go along because she was 
afraid of what she might see and I had 

2281
01:40:51,061 --> 01:40:52,750
encouraged her to come because I'm like,
what's going to happen is you won't even

2282
01:40:52,751 --> 01:40:53,590
know the there.

2283
01:40:53,650 --> 01:40:55,270
We're going to spotted deer that's far 
away.

2284
01:40:56,650 --> 01:41:01,150
Probably obscured by brush.
You'd have to look for it really hard to

2285
01:41:01,151 --> 01:41:01,900
see it.
Anyways,

2286
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:03,880
we're going to shoot it by the time we 
get over there,

2287
01:41:04,270 --> 01:41:07,000
it'll be dead and it's not really the 
experience you're imagining,

2288
01:41:07,390 --> 01:41:12,390
but we beat our skiff and started going 
up this gravel bar to stream bank and 

2289
01:41:12,390 --> 01:41:13,900
here comes three deer.
Something scared him.

2290
01:41:13,990 --> 01:41:18,990
A bear.
I don't know what some scared them 

2291
01:41:18,990 --> 01:41:20,240
because they're running toward us and 
they get so close that I.

2292
01:41:20,260 --> 01:41:25,260
I'm not kidding.
I'm looking at the eyelashes on this 

2293
01:41:25,260 --> 01:41:25,260
deer.
Oh my.

2294
01:41:25,260 --> 01:41:28,810
They're just there and I see that one of
them's got spikes on them is a buck and 

2295
01:41:29,380 --> 01:41:34,380
it was a buck only sees him and I see my
brother were kind of hunkered down by 

2296
01:41:34,380 --> 01:41:35,320
rock and I see him like raised and his 
wife.

2297
01:41:35,720 --> 01:41:37,000
I'm like,
you son of a bitch.

2298
01:41:37,001 --> 01:41:39,100
I was like,
do not shoot this deer right now.

2299
01:41:39,220 --> 01:41:41,290
We'll just get another one later.
And He,

2300
01:41:41,620 --> 01:41:43,040
you know,
piles that deer up.

2301
01:41:43,090 --> 01:41:45,770
And when my wife looked at it,
you say,

2302
01:41:45,771 --> 01:41:49,900
piles that deer up shot at point blank.
How far away we talk in 10 feet.

2303
01:41:49,901 --> 01:41:54,901
And you have that monitor clove and,
and it turned and she turned and she 

2304
01:41:58,811 --> 01:42:01,360
thought that he had missed.
That fell over.

2305
01:42:01,390 --> 01:42:02,640
It was foreign.
I'm exaggerating.

2306
01:42:02,641 --> 01:42:03,780
I was fired.
That was very close.

2307
01:42:03,790 --> 01:42:08,790
Maybe twice that distance.
So even twice I just seeing it's eyelash

2308
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:11,740
talking about like 30 feet and very,
very,

2309
01:42:11,741 --> 01:42:13,120
very close.
And um,

2310
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:18,600
and when she looked at me after seeing 
that she was looking at me across a 

2311
01:42:20,111 --> 01:42:23,470
vast,
vast Gulf of difference of distance.

2312
01:42:23,500 --> 01:42:28,500
It was like,
it was like she looked at me like she 

2313
01:42:28,500 --> 01:42:30,250
had never seen you are known me and I 
asked,

2314
01:42:30,280 --> 01:42:31,050
we have ge,
we were,

2315
01:42:31,120 --> 01:42:32,110
we were just married.

2316
01:42:32,110 --> 01:42:35,710
We were married not even a year and it 
was the look she gave me.

2317
01:42:35,711 --> 01:42:36,510
I was like,
oh,

2318
01:42:36,700 --> 01:42:40,240
this could be the end of our 
relationship.

2319
01:42:40,720 --> 01:42:42,310
Did she find it sexy?
No,

2320
01:42:42,340 --> 01:42:42,690
no,
no.

2321
01:42:42,691 --> 01:42:43,960
Come on me.
Like,

2322
01:42:44,890 --> 01:42:46,990
like we were the barbarian.
Yeah,

2323
01:42:47,320 --> 01:42:47,590
yeah.
Will,

2324
01:42:47,591 --> 01:42:50,400
you just assassinated was right in front
of it,

2325
01:42:50,401 --> 01:42:55,401
but you know,
what was weird it we're sitting and we 

2326
01:42:55,401 --> 01:42:57,721
got,
we drug the thing down and she didn't 

2327
01:42:57,721 --> 01:42:57,721
think we drug it with enough ceremony.
She's like,

2328
01:42:57,721 --> 01:42:58,050
his head was banging,
you know,

2329
01:42:58,060 --> 01:43:03,060
we got it out and drug it back through 
this gift and started motor and back 

2330
01:43:03,060 --> 01:43:07,230
toward our shack and um,
and no one was saying a word in the boat

2331
01:43:09,130 --> 01:43:12,160
at all,
but then within 45 minutes,

2332
01:43:12,670 --> 01:43:16,930
within 45 minutes was enough time for 
her to process what she saw and her take

2333
01:43:16,931 --> 01:43:18,750
home was,
you know what,

2334
01:43:18,751 --> 01:43:20,770
I guess I'd still rather eat that thing.

2335
01:43:21,540 --> 01:43:24,190
Then you know,
an animal from a feed lot.

2336
01:43:24,520 --> 01:43:29,520
Of course it was just like,
it just took her a minute because she 

2337
01:43:29,520 --> 01:43:30,130
was like.
Later I felt like she's like,

2338
01:43:30,160 --> 01:43:32,950
I feel like I should feel something 
different than I do.

2339
01:43:33,340 --> 01:43:35,800
I feel like I should feel outrage 
intellectually.

2340
01:43:36,030 --> 01:43:41,030
Yeah.
But then once you sat in that bowl and 

2341
01:43:41,030 --> 01:43:41,030
thought it was just like,
it just passed,

2342
01:43:41,030 --> 01:43:41,030
it passed.
She's like,

2343
01:43:41,310 --> 01:43:42,070
you know,
I don't know.

2344
01:43:42,190 --> 01:43:45,160
Things die.
It's so fascinating that you have this.

2345
01:43:45,190 --> 01:43:48,940
You have this different point of view on
death.

2346
01:43:49,040 --> 01:43:52,520
Then you know so many people and for 
your wife

2347
01:43:52,640 --> 01:43:57,640
to experience it in its most shocking 
form on the first pass,

2348
01:43:57,690 --> 01:44:02,690
you know,
I'm not sure it would take a little 

2349
01:44:02,690 --> 01:44:04,721
while to intellectualize something 
instinct by butchering the deer and get 

2350
01:44:04,721 --> 01:44:07,370
my hands in that deer.
And I kinda thought to myself,

2351
01:44:07,460 --> 01:44:12,460
I can see how I can certainly see how a 
hunter would have an easier time taking 

2352
01:44:12,460 --> 01:44:15,010
a human's life with a knife or 
wonderful.

2353
01:44:15,110 --> 01:44:20,110
That'll tight.
I think you have an intimate experience 

2354
01:44:20,110 --> 01:44:20,110
with that animal.
You know,

2355
01:44:20,110 --> 01:44:21,910
you're not as squeamish.
Maybe you,

2356
01:44:21,911 --> 01:44:26,911
you.
It is a strange feeling when you reach 

2357
01:44:26,911 --> 01:44:27,010
in there and you feel the guts for the 
first time.

2358
01:44:27,030 --> 01:44:27,160
Okay.

2359
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:29,550
The whole experience was really 
fascinating,

2360
01:44:29,880 --> 01:44:34,880
but I passed out when my wife had an 
epidural when she's having her first 

2361
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:35,110
baby because I used to tell people I'd 
be like,

2362
01:44:35,680 --> 01:44:37,620
and I want to write it off as the needle
thing.

2363
01:44:38,330 --> 01:44:41,250
I told you I could cut your arm off,
but I can't watch you get a shot.

2364
01:44:41,550 --> 01:44:42,540
Wow.
That's so weird.

2365
01:44:42,541 --> 01:44:43,140
I don't know.
It was thing,

2366
01:44:43,170 --> 01:44:45,930
but I don't know that it translates.
I think people do it.

2367
01:44:45,931 --> 01:44:47,430
There's like an argument against 
hunting.

2368
01:44:47,431 --> 01:44:49,480
Is that it?
Like the attorneys you into like,

2369
01:44:49,610 --> 01:44:52,200
like you're so comfortable death and 
you're like an animal.

2370
01:44:52,230 --> 01:44:57,230
That should be the necessarily trans.
I don't think it translates to being 

2371
01:44:57,230 --> 01:45:00,920
comfortable.
I mean that's the same argument than 

2372
01:45:01,461 --> 01:45:06,461
that.
Someone who runs a chicken farm can be 

2373
01:45:06,461 --> 01:45:06,461
killed chickens.
Okay.

2374
01:45:06,461 --> 01:45:08,520
I just think that violence transform you
transforms you fundamentally.

2375
01:45:08,521 --> 01:45:13,521
For example,
like when you've done combat sports and 

2376
01:45:13,521 --> 01:45:14,850
you've gotten punched and knocked out or
kicked in the head and knocked out or,

2377
01:45:15,080 --> 01:45:18,180
or just put into a choking and you are 
different.

2378
01:45:18,270 --> 01:45:21,240
You are different about your own 
mortality,

2379
01:45:21,241 --> 01:45:25,830
your own relationships to other men do.
Do you know what I mean?

2380
01:45:25,831 --> 01:45:27,080
Like when you,
when you've been,

2381
01:45:27,420 --> 01:45:32,420
when you've been taken,
when you've been taken to a man or you 

2382
01:45:32,420 --> 01:45:33,570
had somebody do like whatever they want 
to and you realize,

2383
01:45:33,870 --> 01:45:35,580
oh,
I'm very vulnerable.

2384
01:45:35,581 --> 01:45:40,581
You or you get knocked out and it really
hurts her hitting the body that I think 

2385
01:45:40,591 --> 01:45:43,030
fundamentally changes you,
um,

2386
01:45:43,210 --> 01:45:43,620
in,
in,

2387
01:45:43,810 --> 01:45:46,680
in your relationship,
not just to other men.

2388
01:45:46,710 --> 01:45:48,030
How do you think it's related to hunting
though?

2389
01:45:48,470 --> 01:45:49,770
In the same way?
Like when you,

2390
01:45:49,830 --> 01:45:53,670
when you have an intimate experience of 
harvesting your own meat,

2391
01:45:53,970 --> 01:45:56,070
which actually requires a really loud 
noise,

2392
01:45:56,440 --> 01:46:00,540
a killing of an animal,
and you see that blood and you feel that

2393
01:46:01,140 --> 01:46:03,780
just was alive and you're touching it,
then you go butcher it.

2394
01:46:04,850 --> 01:46:08,820
I feel like I approach.
I don't know,

2395
01:46:08,821 --> 01:46:09,160
man,
it,

2396
01:46:09,480 --> 01:46:11,700
I don't even know how to articulate how 
it changed me,

2397
01:46:11,701 --> 01:46:14,170
but I do think that something that,
that,

2398
01:46:14,180 --> 01:46:15,840
that is that intimately violent.

2399
01:46:16,110 --> 01:46:16,700
Yeah,
um,

2400
01:46:16,870 --> 01:46:21,150
is going to keep saying violence because
I don't see it as violence at all.

2401
01:46:21,200 --> 01:46:24,360
But I think it's,
it's pretty abrupt in it's ending.

2402
01:46:24,361 --> 01:46:28,200
I mean there's violent attacks using it.
Violence I used to not use,

2403
01:46:28,210 --> 01:46:32,040
I started like coming to turn because I 
don't want to like sanctify it,

2404
01:46:32,580 --> 01:46:33,230
you know what I mean?
And,

2405
01:46:33,231 --> 01:46:34,620
and,
and I'd be careful about,

2406
01:46:34,650 --> 01:46:39,650
this is the thing in the hunting world 
where people were very reluctant to use 

2407
01:46:39,650 --> 01:46:40,320
the word kill.
There's euphemisms for kill harvest.

2408
01:46:41,560 --> 01:46:43,520
They kind of like harvest or take.
But I feel like,

2409
01:46:43,521 --> 01:46:45,960
I mean the obvious to the gunshot is 
violent,

2410
01:46:45,990 --> 01:46:48,190
but the,
the butchering and all that stuff didn't

2411
01:46:49,520 --> 01:46:50,340
post violence.

2412
01:46:50,400 --> 01:46:51,330
Yeah,
that's what I'm saying.

2413
01:46:52,270 --> 01:46:56,850
But I just mean the blood very graphic 
and real temperature of the blood,

2414
01:46:56,851 --> 01:47:01,851
smelling it right up to my arms.
I'm not trying to imply that shooting 

2415
01:47:01,851 --> 01:47:04,980
animals wasn't violent.
I met the butchering and everything like

2416
01:47:04,981 --> 01:47:06,060
that,
but the whole experience,

2417
01:47:06,061 --> 01:47:07,800
I didn't think of it as a violent 
experience.

2418
01:47:08,060 --> 01:47:10,170
It was very surreal.
Very,

2419
01:47:10,171 --> 01:47:11,710
um,
you know,

2420
01:47:12,340 --> 01:47:12,730
the,
the,

2421
01:47:12,840 --> 01:47:13,500
you know,
that's a,

2422
01:47:13,640 --> 01:47:17,430
like a commonly used term,
like the connection to nature.

2423
01:47:17,470 --> 01:47:22,230
It's one of those terms I think that's 
used so much that the meaning of it gets

2424
01:47:22,231 --> 01:47:24,330
a little fuzzy to get a little 
bullshitty,

2425
01:47:24,500 --> 01:47:27,390
you know,
oh my connection to nature and Sot nom,

2426
01:47:27,650 --> 01:47:32,650
you know,
but that is what it is when you're out 

2427
01:47:32,650 --> 01:47:34,050
there living in that animal's world,
sleeping on the ground,

2428
01:47:34,200 --> 01:47:37,860
just basically like they do and then 
following them around and shoot one.

2429
01:47:37,861 --> 01:47:40,110
Then you're pulling it's heart and liver
out.

2430
01:47:40,340 --> 01:47:42,860
That's,
that's a fucking connection to Sirius.

2431
01:47:43,060 --> 01:47:45,500
I still got a different respect for what
a knife can do.

2432
01:47:45,501 --> 01:47:46,560
It's weird,
like you go,

2433
01:47:46,561 --> 01:47:47,750
wow man,
they really do.

2434
01:47:48,010 --> 01:47:49,220
Yeah,
we talked,

2435
01:47:49,450 --> 01:47:54,450
we talked about this,
you know that that's the thing that I 

2436
01:47:54,450 --> 01:47:54,450
found like being out with you on that,
on that

2437
01:47:54,450 --> 01:47:59,170
trip.
And then the thought of having one with 

2438
01:47:59,301 --> 01:48:02,120
Tim Ferris wants is people that have 
been the fighters.

2439
01:48:02,150 --> 01:48:03,530
Like I'm there.
I'm not a fighter like I haven't,

2440
01:48:03,550 --> 01:48:06,650
I've been hit a couple of times but 
never beat anybody up or anything.

2441
01:48:06,820 --> 01:48:09,850
Well I beat up one guy in ninth grade,
but you know,

2442
01:48:10,220 --> 01:48:15,170
but I think that you bring a level of 
calmness just to the act of shooting,

2443
01:48:15,770 --> 01:48:19,310
like being able to like get down to 
shoot some people are.

2444
01:48:19,311 --> 01:48:24,311
So I'm unable to control adrenaline and 
fear.

2445
01:48:26,240 --> 01:48:27,470
They become.
They can't shoot.

2446
01:48:28,260 --> 01:48:28,970
Yeah,
I could.

2447
01:48:29,490 --> 01:48:31,370
I was.
I got a buddy who guide

2448
01:48:31,480 --> 01:48:34,660
and he was saying one time he took this 
guy up and they were hunting tar in,

2449
01:48:34,770 --> 01:48:39,770
in New Zealand and the guy shot in my 
buddy's watching through his binoculars 

2450
01:48:39,770 --> 01:48:42,100
where the bullet hit in any show me,
someone was rolling a video.

2451
01:48:42,310 --> 01:48:45,010
When did it?
And you hear my body say you,

2452
01:48:45,130 --> 01:48:46,570
you're 20 feet high.

2453
01:48:49,440 --> 01:48:51,870
Hi.
Hi.

2454
01:48:53,130 --> 01:48:54,590
That's hilarious.
A lot of,

2455
01:48:55,030 --> 01:48:57,300
just the amount of time I've reversed 
his mind.

2456
01:48:57,301 --> 01:49:00,180
He left his mind when I was um,
when uh,

2457
01:49:00,240 --> 01:49:05,240
the,
I would have been able to shoot that 

2458
01:49:05,240 --> 01:49:07,161
deer with the first time we saw him.
But I didn't have enough practice with 

2459
01:49:07,161 --> 01:49:09,840
that scope and I was too close to the 
scope and you know,

2460
01:49:09,841 --> 01:49:13,840
he get that weird thing.
I couldn't find him in there too.

2461
01:49:13,860 --> 01:49:18,860
It was almost like to like a black half 
moons criss crossing over into that.

2462
01:49:19,371 --> 01:49:21,690
Couldn't like get the image more than 
that.

2463
01:49:21,800 --> 01:49:22,140
More than that.

2464
01:49:22,190 --> 01:49:24,300
Anything else,
um,

2465
01:49:24,890 --> 01:49:28,200
is cause of,
of beginner hunters.

2466
01:49:28,790 --> 01:49:31,460
Not Getting shots at things is the 
weird.

2467
01:49:31,461 --> 01:49:33,020
I like the,
I really fishes,

2468
01:49:33,021 --> 01:49:38,021
it becomes very second nature but pretty
precise like where you put it and when 

2469
01:49:38,021 --> 01:49:39,620
you're in like in a weird position and 
things were happening fast.

2470
01:49:39,621 --> 01:49:40,370
It's tough man.
Yeah.

2471
01:49:40,371 --> 01:49:41,450
For folks who don't know what we're 
saying,

2472
01:49:41,451 --> 01:49:44,930
there's a scope on the top of the rifle 
and if you're too close to that scope,

2473
01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:46,670
it distorts your view.
It fucks up.

2474
01:49:47,020 --> 01:49:48,190
You have to be just

2475
01:49:48,280 --> 01:49:53,280
in the right spot.
And the first time we saw the deer I 

2476
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:55,840
couldn't get it in the right spot.
And then he went behind this little area

2477
01:49:55,841 --> 01:49:58,870
and then came back out again.
And when he came back out again,

2478
01:49:59,320 --> 01:50:02,040
I was able to figure it out.
I pulled back a little bit.

2479
01:50:02,060 --> 01:50:02,980
I was like,
oh,

2480
01:50:02,981 --> 01:50:04,960
there it is,
but I was freaking out.

2481
01:50:04,961 --> 01:50:09,961
I was like,
I can't fucking see this thing and if I 

2482
01:50:09,961 --> 01:50:10,780
lose this fucking deer because of this,
I'll go crazy.

2483
01:50:11,290 --> 01:50:16,290
We have been stalking them for days.
Just excuse me.

2484
01:50:17,140 --> 01:50:18,840
Just one.
Yeah,

2485
01:50:19,030 --> 01:50:21,190
to get it done.
Yeah.

2486
01:50:21,220 --> 01:50:24,970
I was desperate to motivation.
That comes out,

2487
01:50:24,971 --> 01:50:29,971
man.
There's a lot of things that like 

2488
01:50:29,971 --> 01:50:30,620
there's a lot of things that come out in
Huntington I think are applicable to the

2489
01:50:30,790 --> 01:50:35,790
life and work and stuff,
but you get like when you've been out 

2490
01:50:35,790 --> 01:50:37,120
there a couple of days and you start 
getting accustomed to that.

2491
01:50:37,360 --> 01:50:39,480
I think it's easy to go for a day and 
walk me.

2492
01:50:39,520 --> 01:50:42,190
They already didn't happen.
You got a couple of days into something.

2493
01:50:42,520 --> 01:50:44,710
Most people like what I would almost 
call it,

2494
01:50:44,770 --> 01:50:47,260
like a work ethic or like something 
comes up where you're like,

2495
01:50:47,290 --> 01:50:48,700
you know,
we've committed ourselves to this.

2496
01:50:48,730 --> 01:50:51,820
We put time into it.
We're out here and you just want to make

2497
01:50:51,821 --> 01:50:53,980
it happen and it brings out a level of 
drive.

2498
01:50:54,320 --> 01:50:58,090
That's what happened to me.
Good to come to fulfill the goal of that

2499
01:50:58,091 --> 01:51:03,091
moment becomes such a gigantic sweeping 
moment and that's why it's hard to like 

2500
01:51:03,091 --> 01:51:07,861
stay calm,
but it actually happens when you're 

2501
01:51:07,861 --> 01:51:10,201
building up with two days of fucking 
shitty camping and one with a Bahraini 

2502
01:51:10,510 --> 01:51:15,510
and pouring outside and coal every 
morning and going to bed at like eight 

2503
01:51:15,510 --> 01:51:17,050
because there's nothing to do.
It gets dark.

2504
01:51:17,051 --> 01:51:22,051
We all just go to bed and then we'd get 
up and like where are we getting up at 

2505
01:51:22,051 --> 01:51:22,051
like six,
six in the morning,

2506
01:51:22,051 --> 01:51:22,410
whatever.

2507
01:51:22,690 --> 01:51:26,080
And then just wandering around trying to
find a deer and um,

2508
01:51:26,170 --> 01:51:27,620
but the,
the,

2509
01:51:27,730 --> 01:51:31,960
one of the craziest visions was when we 
were on the top of one of those hills.

2510
01:51:32,410 --> 01:51:36,520
And you look around at the vastness of 
that area.

2511
01:51:36,760 --> 01:51:39,710
And man was that fucking humbling.
We were standing.

2512
01:51:39,720 --> 01:51:41,080
I remember,
I remember this.

2513
01:51:41,081 --> 01:51:46,081
We were on the top of one of the hills 
is one of the first time you spotted a 

2514
01:51:46,081 --> 01:51:46,081
sheep.
You were,

2515
01:51:46,081 --> 01:51:50,250
you were glass in the area and you 
spotted a big sheep way the fuck away 

2516
01:51:50,250 --> 01:51:51,730
from us.
And when we're on top,

2517
01:51:51,731 --> 01:51:56,731
we're looking around.
You just get up looking over at the 

2518
01:51:56,731 --> 01:52:00,811
vastness of this thing,
like you could just start walking and 

2519
01:52:00,811 --> 01:52:03,100
starve to death and nobody would ever 
find you.

2520
01:52:03,250 --> 01:52:08,250
I thought when we ever find you out 
there talking about how cold it was all 

2521
01:52:08,250 --> 01:52:09,790
the time and starving to death and how 
you have no light,

2522
01:52:10,090 --> 01:52:11,860
you can keep that stone age shit.

2523
01:52:12,330 --> 01:52:16,090
It was fun.
I enjoyed it for five days.

2524
01:52:16,091 --> 01:52:18,040
I'll tell you that.
It is a humbling area though,

2525
01:52:18,041 --> 01:52:23,041
man,
and it's one of those cool areas that 

2526
01:52:23,041 --> 01:52:24,511
really,
and again to talk about the Missouri 

2527
01:52:24,511 --> 01:52:25,270
Breaks region,
it's one of those cool areas that really

2528
01:52:25,271 --> 01:52:28,960
just kind of on its own resistant 
development.

2529
01:52:29,110 --> 01:52:34,110
If there's some spots that were,
were so stunning that early on people 

2530
01:52:34,331 --> 01:52:37,090
were like,
this is like you'll 70 yellowstone.

2531
01:52:37,270 --> 01:52:41,290
It was like the momentum was always 
going toward hanging onto it.

2532
01:52:41,500 --> 01:52:43,110
You know,
people wonder like this is special.

2533
01:52:43,210 --> 01:52:45,650
I mean we got hot guys was shooting up 
out the ground.

2534
01:52:46,830 --> 01:52:49,730
We should early on like make sure does 
not screw this place up.

2535
01:52:50,360 --> 01:52:54,350
And there's some great areas in the US.
Like I would argue hell's kitchen,

2536
01:52:54,380 --> 01:52:59,380
hell's canyon.
The Missouri breaks reason that just 

2537
01:52:59,380 --> 01:53:02,810
remained peer,
just through toughness and tenacity.

2538
01:53:03,080 --> 01:53:05,420
Like everybody went in there and tried 
to do something.

2539
01:53:05,480 --> 01:53:10,480
Yeah,
and it's like one of those places where 

2540
01:53:10,480 --> 01:53:10,480
you go and it's like they try to do that
didn't work out.

2541
01:53:10,820 --> 01:53:15,180
Like one of the things that that place 
is known for is it horse thieves use.

2542
01:53:15,220 --> 01:53:18,410
It does go there because they knew they 
could go hide out,

2543
01:53:18,980 --> 01:53:23,980
you know,
it was like useful to them just as a 

2544
01:53:23,980 --> 01:53:23,980
place to hide out and there was some 
campaigns where it was like,

2545
01:53:23,980 --> 01:53:25,610
we're going to go into the brakes,
we're going to find them all,

2546
01:53:25,670 --> 01:53:30,670
we're going to hang him from cottonwoods
and they'd go down in and root out the 

2547
01:53:30,670 --> 01:53:30,670
guys.

2548
01:53:30,670 --> 01:53:32,480
And it was like a spot that held 
wildlife for long time,

2549
01:53:32,870 --> 01:53:37,870
you know,
it was a spot where some of the plains 

2550
01:53:37,870 --> 01:53:37,870
tribes could go down and hide out in 
there.

2551
01:53:38,140 --> 01:53:43,140
In the Mussel shell that goes into that 
area was one of the last place they had 

2552
01:53:43,140 --> 01:53:44,480
free roaming herds of Buffalo in 
Montana.

2553
01:53:44,770 --> 01:53:49,770
It was just like a spot where people 
would try to get a grip and it just 

2554
01:53:49,770 --> 01:53:51,500
didn't hold and now it still isn't 
really.

2555
01:53:52,010 --> 01:53:57,010
There's some protections there,
but it's not like categorically 

2556
01:53:57,010 --> 01:53:57,010
protected like a place like yellowstone 
is,

2557
01:53:57,010 --> 01:53:58,910
but it just,
after awhile people almost kind of threw

2558
01:53:58,911 --> 01:54:00,980
their hands up in the air.
It interesting that you're talking about

2559
01:54:00,981 --> 01:54:01,120
is

2560
01:54:01,460 --> 01:54:05,120
because I don't know what you're saying.
It's like the people trying to settle in

2561
01:54:05,121 --> 01:54:06,890
that area couldn't,
they couldn't live.

2562
01:54:06,891 --> 01:54:09,410
They couldn't run farms grow stuff 
couldn't grow.

2563
01:54:09,470 --> 01:54:09,720
So

2564
01:54:10,810 --> 01:54:12,930
yeah,
people would go in and try to um,

2565
01:54:13,150 --> 01:54:14,650
do you homesteads they try to run.

2566
01:54:15,400 --> 01:54:18,130
Government says that if you stay on this
land for x amount of time,

2567
01:54:18,380 --> 01:54:21,020
yours is,
that you do improvements on it,

2568
01:54:21,280 --> 01:54:26,280
you do improvements.
So there was all these homesteads sites 

2569
01:54:26,280 --> 01:54:28,741
where we were walking around and we'd 
find these really old logs that used to 

2570
01:54:28,741 --> 01:54:30,210
be a side of a house.

2571
01:54:31,070 --> 01:54:34,130
The sheep shacks or sad houses.
Root cellars.

2572
01:54:34,520 --> 01:54:39,520
It's fucking weird.
What's our root cellar be like under 

2573
01:54:39,520 --> 01:54:44,080
like a climate controlled area where you
dig down into the ground and have like a

2574
01:54:44,691 --> 01:54:49,691
cruel place to store things or.
And it also be freeze proof because 

2575
01:54:49,691 --> 01:54:49,691
you're down,
you know,

2576
01:54:49,691 --> 01:54:54,190
you go down to the dirt ways and then 
there's still a lot of old structures 

2577
01:54:54,190 --> 01:54:54,190
there to have sought,
you know,

2578
01:54:54,190 --> 01:54:58,031
you can see that it had a sod roof.
How far do you have to go to in the 

2579
01:54:58,031 --> 01:54:58,460
ground before it becomes freeze proof?
Well,

2580
01:54:58,490 --> 01:55:00,760
however far down the frost line is when 
you put in,

2581
01:55:00,860 --> 01:55:01,890
you know,
people have a frost,

2582
01:55:01,930 --> 01:55:06,930
you rise in your yard.
What do you got to most places like in 

2583
01:55:06,930 --> 01:55:09,431
Michigan member we'd only go to our 
frost for your eyes are only went down 

2584
01:55:09,431 --> 01:55:09,431
36 inches.
How fucked up is it?

2585
01:55:09,460 --> 01:55:11,930
They go deep into the ground.
It stops being cold.

2586
01:55:11,931 --> 01:55:13,110
When you go deep enough,
it'll burn

2587
01:55:13,180 --> 01:55:14,790
your ass,
but isn't that,

2588
01:55:14,800 --> 01:55:19,800
is that why it is getting past the 
surface and it's getting closer to the 

2589
01:55:19,800 --> 01:55:23,790
public.
In Alaska what they do is they dig down 

2590
01:55:23,790 --> 01:55:23,790
into the,
the

2591
01:55:23,790 --> 01:55:23,790
permafrost and use that for 
refrigeration.

2592
01:55:23,790 --> 01:55:26,320
All year.
Oh Wow.

2593
01:55:26,321 --> 01:55:27,850
That's interesting.
So does that.

2594
01:55:27,880 --> 01:55:30,940
Wow guys used you read about guys on the
prairie.

2595
01:55:30,941 --> 01:55:35,941
They used to.
They would in the winter hunt and dig 

2596
01:55:35,941 --> 01:55:36,850
down into the ground where the ground 
was frozen.

2597
01:55:37,090 --> 01:55:39,490
There was in the winter hunt and fill 
that with animals,

2598
01:55:39,640 --> 01:55:44,640
fill it with corridors of meat and let 
that freeze in the winter and then pile 

2599
01:55:44,640 --> 01:55:49,220
canvas down or blankets on top of that.
Put dirt back on so it would freeze and 

2600
01:55:49,220 --> 01:55:49,660
it dig that up.
Months into the summer.

2601
01:55:49,661 --> 01:55:50,050
Net meets

2602
01:55:50,280 --> 01:55:52,720
good down there on campus,

2603
01:55:54,830 --> 01:55:56,810
frozen.
Dig a big deep pit,

2604
01:55:56,960 --> 01:56:01,960
eight feet deep,
whatever and put me in and let it get 

2605
01:56:01,960 --> 01:56:03,920
frozen and then piled dirt on.
Let all that frees up and then it'll get

2606
01:56:03,921 --> 01:56:05,590
warm out and you could dig down there 
later.

2607
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:08,040
The mito who's a fucking genius who 
figured that out.

2608
01:56:08,400 --> 01:56:10,260
That's brilliant.
What about worms and stuff?

2609
01:56:10,261 --> 01:56:11,440
I guess not.
I dude,

2610
01:56:11,460 --> 01:56:12,270
I've been watching.

2611
01:56:13,190 --> 01:56:14,690
There's not getting fly larva.
I mean,

2612
01:56:14,691 --> 01:56:16,940
if you let flies land on it and it was 
hot out and you buried it,

2613
01:56:16,941 --> 01:56:19,100
you'd have a mess on your hands,
but you know,

2614
01:56:19,360 --> 01:56:21,330
anybody knows if you dig a hole and put 
your hand on there,

2615
01:56:21,331 --> 01:56:23,400
it's cool down there.
Wow.

2616
01:56:23,710 --> 01:56:25,310
I'm fascinated by these,
uh,

2617
01:56:25,320 --> 01:56:27,900
Alaska shows,
all these different subsistence shows.

2618
01:56:27,901 --> 01:56:32,901
Have you seen any of those con men and 
all these different shows and these 

2619
01:56:32,901 --> 01:56:36,411
people just live up there and they'd 
been living up there for generations 

2620
01:56:36,411 --> 01:56:36,411
just,
you know,

2621
01:56:36,411 --> 01:56:39,090
trying to get by killing rabbits and 
eaten them.

2622
01:56:39,091 --> 01:56:41,520
And a good,
good lot of crafting this man.

2623
01:56:42,110 --> 01:56:44,140
Carnivores straight up with that.
Oh,

2624
01:56:44,200 --> 01:56:49,200
100 percent.
I mean they grow some vegetables in the 

2625
01:56:49,200 --> 01:56:50,190
four months that they have to do so they
have like a greenhouse and shit,

2626
01:56:50,191 --> 01:56:52,650
but most of their food they're getting 
from,

2627
01:56:52,710 --> 01:56:54,060
you know,
shooting animals.

2628
01:56:54,120 --> 01:56:58,350
What are the native Americans.
I know it varies on in the country,

2629
01:56:58,351 --> 01:57:02,070
but where do they get their vitamin C in
their micronutrient freshmeat GNC

2630
01:57:02,790 --> 01:57:05,160
that GNC is.
You don't get scurvy.

2631
01:57:05,210 --> 01:57:06,670
Freshman,
there's this amazing story.

2632
01:57:06,671 --> 01:57:07,750
Yeah,
there's this amazing story,

2633
01:57:07,751 --> 01:57:09,670
but yeah,
this is the blood in it.

2634
01:57:09,900 --> 01:57:11,070
Yeah,
drive it,

2635
01:57:11,150 --> 01:57:11,970
drive me,
lose it.

2636
01:57:12,010 --> 01:57:13,690
So even when you,
when you put in,

2637
01:57:13,780 --> 01:57:15,970
when you put fruit in it,
if you're making fruit Jerky,

2638
01:57:15,971 --> 01:57:17,620
put bananas in a dehydrated or 
something,

2639
01:57:17,830 --> 01:57:21,730
fruit loses vitamin C you through 
dehydration on there's some loss of it.

2640
01:57:22,030 --> 01:57:23,710
There's this amazing story about the 
French.

2641
01:57:23,880 --> 01:57:28,880
When the French started going,
coming over here to engage in the trade 

2642
01:57:28,880 --> 01:57:31,861
and do all their explorer and they were 
centered around like a focal point of 

2643
01:57:31,861 --> 01:57:34,891
the St Lawrence Seaway,
champlain guy that's now the father of 

2644
01:57:34,891 --> 01:57:38,271
new France.
He had this idea where he's going to 

2645
01:57:38,271 --> 01:57:42,061
take a orphans from Paris and bring them
over and given to the Indians thinking 

2646
01:57:44,201 --> 01:57:46,840
that the kids already knew French.
He'd give him to the Indians.

2647
01:57:46,840 --> 01:57:48,820
They need to go take them off for a 
couple of years,

2648
01:57:49,060 --> 01:57:52,810
come back and they'd be bilingual and 
he'd be able to use these as emissaries,

2649
01:57:53,230 --> 01:57:58,230
ambassadors and trade,
and one of the first ones that we know 

2650
01:57:58,230 --> 01:57:58,630
about that you tried this with is this 
kid who's later.

2651
01:57:58,640 --> 01:58:03,640
We now people come,
Etienne Brulay gave them to the Indians 

2652
01:58:03,820 --> 01:58:08,820
and the when the first winter when they 
came in with champlain is people came 

2653
01:58:08,820 --> 01:58:10,120
over,
they died like mad of scurvy all winter,

2654
01:58:10,330 --> 01:58:15,330
but this kid was supposed to go hang out
with any of this so they would go out 

2655
01:58:15,330 --> 01:58:16,300
and fish through the ice and hunt and 
they were eating the meat diet,

2656
01:58:16,420 --> 01:58:18,190
but they had,
I don't know,

2657
01:58:18,460 --> 01:58:23,460
24 fatalities that year.
The vast majority of people all died 

2658
01:58:23,460 --> 01:58:25,870
could never died and everybody else's 
holed up in their cabins,

2659
01:58:25,871 --> 01:58:27,820
eating hard tack and salt pork and 
stuff,

2660
01:58:28,080 --> 01:58:30,700
and this kid that was out roaming around
eating fresh killed,

2661
01:58:30,701 --> 01:58:32,980
meet,
survived,

2662
01:58:33,520 --> 01:58:35,350
and then later went on to do all these 
amazing.

2663
01:58:35,440 --> 01:58:40,440
Made all these discovery.
He was the first person to see lake 

2664
01:58:40,440 --> 01:58:42,751
superior.
First person all over the Great Lakes 

2665
01:58:42,751 --> 01:58:44,641
went down all the way.
The [inaudible] river might've been the 

2666
01:58:44,641 --> 01:58:45,880
first white guy ever.
Lay eyes was behind.

2667
01:58:45,920 --> 01:58:46,930
It was,
you know,

2668
01:58:47,170 --> 01:58:48,580
it's,
it is just A.

2669
01:58:48,610 --> 01:58:50,290
Joey is a.

2670
01:58:51,080 --> 01:58:55,100
There was apparently something in the 
Laurel and hardy called the sasquatch.

2671
01:58:55,110 --> 01:58:58,070
Hannah hat company and the Susko and a 
hat company,

2672
01:58:58,100 --> 01:59:00,070
like they had shitty hats and they'd put
the hats on.

2673
01:59:00,080 --> 01:59:02,570
The top would pop off like this is 
really old stuff.

2674
01:59:03,020 --> 01:59:08,020
And Joey Diaz once went on this crazy 
rant for like 10 minutes about how our 

2675
01:59:08,020 --> 01:59:10,280
weed was Susko handle.
We need this fucking sucks into weed.

2676
01:59:10,460 --> 01:59:15,460
And I didn't know what he meant.
I thought he was talking about Hannah 

2677
01:59:15,460 --> 01:59:15,460
Montana,
so it was totally confused.

2678
01:59:15,460 --> 01:59:20,351
I was like,
what the fuck are you fucking feed me 

2679
01:59:20,351 --> 01:59:20,351
over here?

2680
01:59:21,340 --> 01:59:22,320
But anyway,
they eventually eight,

2681
01:59:22,321 --> 01:59:25,110
this kid ate quiet dude.
Yeah.

2682
01:59:25,111 --> 01:59:28,020
That was common.
That was another gay man

2683
01:59:28,030 --> 01:59:30,170
you told me that a lot of the,
uh,

2684
01:59:30,171 --> 01:59:32,560
the tribes of the Great Lakes,
like cannibalism,

2685
01:59:32,580 --> 01:59:33,670
that's fairly common out there.

2686
01:59:33,690 --> 01:59:35,460
Yeah.
Mandated quarter people out.

2687
01:59:36,480 --> 01:59:37,530
Wait a minute.
What was the,

2688
01:59:37,680 --> 01:59:42,680
what tribes were,
were dealing with the Iroquois eight 

2689
01:59:42,680 --> 01:59:42,680
Brulay,
you know,

2690
01:59:42,920 --> 01:59:44,760
that said that.
See he was going,

2691
01:59:44,820 --> 01:59:49,820
he wants to go and totally feral.
He went totally native and in the 

2692
01:59:49,820 --> 01:59:50,610
French,
even the French even disowned him,

2693
01:59:50,810 --> 01:59:51,680
you know,
because he,

2694
01:59:51,730 --> 01:59:56,730
he had complained,
he'd come back for the trading season 

2695
01:59:56,730 --> 01:59:56,940
with Indians and they complained that 
he,

2696
01:59:57,390 --> 01:59:58,290
that he,
uh,

2697
01:59:58,320 --> 02:00:00,480
his morality,
he had conformed to the tribes,

2698
02:00:00,720 --> 02:00:04,350
like you're going to turn a 13 year old 
over to some,

2699
02:00:04,410 --> 02:00:09,410
to an indigenous culture and go away for
a couple years and he's going to come 

2700
02:00:09,410 --> 02:00:09,870
back still acting like a French 
Catholic.

2701
02:00:10,410 --> 02:00:12,900
It's kind of ludicrous.
That's the story of target.

2702
02:00:12,930 --> 02:00:17,930
They were like really upset that he came
back and he was very promiscuous in his 

2703
02:00:17,930 --> 02:00:21,381
hair.
He changed his hair and more native 

2704
02:00:21,381 --> 02:00:21,381
dress modern.

2705
02:00:21,381 --> 02:00:24,090
So he integrated and eventually he got 
into a legend,

2706
02:00:24,091 --> 02:00:29,091
has it.
I don't know how much they really know 

2707
02:00:29,091 --> 02:00:30,741
about what happened.
Legend has he gotten a dispute over a 

2708
02:00:30,741 --> 02:00:32,520
woman up on Georgian Bay and Lake Huron 
and they cooked them and ate them,

2709
02:00:32,610 --> 02:00:33,860
Jesus Christ.
And they would,

2710
02:00:33,900 --> 02:00:38,900
they would boil them.
So what these guys would do in this 

2711
02:00:38,900 --> 02:00:42,951
area,
like a lot of these tribes when the 

2712
02:00:42,951 --> 02:00:45,080
Great Lakes area,
they would sometimes they would just 

2713
02:00:45,080 --> 02:00:46,671
carry captives in the boat live and then
butcher one you wanted to eat them or 

2714
02:00:48,870 --> 02:00:53,870
they would rate an area in butcher 
everyone and to stack the quarters in 

2715
02:00:54,331 --> 02:00:56,160
the bowls.
So there's accounts of people talk about

2716
02:00:56,220 --> 02:00:58,940
human legs stacked up and bolts just as 
traveling,

2717
02:00:58,950 --> 02:01:01,440
food prune long and,
and all of that stuff.

2718
02:01:01,450 --> 02:01:05,130
You're making people eat parts of 
themselves and you know,

2719
02:01:05,131 --> 02:01:08,090
like cutting off their fingers and 
making them meet your finger,

2720
02:01:08,130 --> 02:01:10,650
you know,
like having a big sport out of it.

2721
02:01:10,651 --> 02:01:15,090
Just just comprehensible now man.
But people argue,

2722
02:01:15,091 --> 02:01:17,110
you know,
anthropologists argue that all,

2723
02:01:17,580 --> 02:01:22,580
all had that,
all that violence had some societal 

2724
02:01:22,580 --> 02:01:23,450
function.
And you know,

2725
02:01:23,451 --> 02:01:25,950
I don't know this side of the function 
of them.

2726
02:01:26,460 --> 02:01:30,450
So this brutality man legs in a boat for
travel food.

2727
02:01:30,480 --> 02:01:31,410
Holy Shit.

2728
02:01:31,490 --> 02:01:32,010
Yeah.
We're in,

2729
02:01:32,240 --> 02:01:35,000
we're in New Zealand film and in New 
Zealand we went and looked at this,

2730
02:01:35,210 --> 02:01:39,620
this island in this big lake.
And what they say is that the indigenous

2731
02:01:40,400 --> 02:01:43,070
people in New Zealand and South Island 
Wedding Benner that long,

2732
02:01:43,071 --> 02:01:46,160
but they had been there.
They had some people would come from the

2733
02:01:46,160 --> 02:01:49,420
North Island and conquered the people in
the South Island.

2734
02:01:49,490 --> 02:01:54,490
It would keep stocks,
have them out on this island and when 

2735
02:01:54,490 --> 02:01:58,860
and staked out and when they want to 
paddle out and get them an Itam,

2736
02:02:00,460 --> 02:02:03,170
Jesus Christ.
It's like Cormac Mccarthy's the road,

2737
02:02:03,171 --> 02:02:05,000
you know,
it's kind of fascinating that,

2738
02:02:05,030 --> 02:02:06,590
um,
I got to the road,

2739
02:02:06,591 --> 02:02:11,591
I watched the movie until he was showing
the kid at to shoot himself in the 

2740
02:02:11,591 --> 02:02:11,591
mouth.
And I went,

2741
02:02:11,591 --> 02:02:11,591
nope,
no,

2742
02:02:11,591 --> 02:02:14,030
thank you.
Need this fucking visual in my brain.

2743
02:02:14,031 --> 02:02:14,840
Yeah.
Um,

2744
02:02:15,020 --> 02:02:16,010
but the,
uh,

2745
02:02:16,011 --> 02:02:21,011
the idea that this was happening on like
a really regular basis is really not.

2746
02:02:21,380 --> 02:02:24,530
A lot of people don't know that that's 
all in the folklore here.

2747
02:02:24,560 --> 02:02:26,630
The native American that's never 
discussed.

2748
02:02:26,631 --> 02:02:30,410
It's always they were in one with nature
and how they were peaceful.

2749
02:02:30,410 --> 02:02:31,970
Do the wide band,
but white van,

2750
02:02:32,660 --> 02:02:34,130
they were human.
They were.

2751
02:02:34,550 --> 02:02:39,550
I know it's so hard to come to grips 
with what happened to the indigenous 

2752
02:02:39,550 --> 02:02:40,880
peoples here.
It's so hard to come to grips to it that

2753
02:02:40,910 --> 02:02:45,050
you people wind up going in wild 
directions.

2754
02:02:45,230 --> 02:02:48,020
It's like did,
it was just brutal savage re,

2755
02:02:48,230 --> 02:02:53,230
you know,
it was just awful existence or that it 

2756
02:02:53,230 --> 02:02:53,360
was just like peaceful,
harmonious existence.

2757
02:02:53,720 --> 02:02:56,300
It's like it's really hard to just be 
like,

2758
02:02:56,301 --> 02:03:01,301
you know what?
There were complex and varied cultures 

2759
02:03:01,730 --> 02:03:06,730
that lived here that had,
that were human works and.

2760
02:03:07,180 --> 02:03:08,930
All right,
well the Sioux,

2761
02:03:09,130 --> 02:03:10,160
you know the idea,
the,

2762
02:03:10,240 --> 02:03:15,240
the,
the word sue means Indian and Indian 

2763
02:03:15,240 --> 02:03:15,740
means enemy there.
They call themselves the Lakota people.

2764
02:03:16,220 --> 02:03:19,220
The word sue apparently was what the 
other Indians called them.

2765
02:03:20,460 --> 02:03:23,210
There's a similar thing with basketball.
It was a derogatory term.

2766
02:03:23,211 --> 02:03:27,340
The athabaskan people refer to the 
coastal people as you know,

2767
02:03:27,350 --> 02:03:32,350
years of raw fish or whatever and it 
became like a derogatory term that 

2768
02:03:32,350 --> 02:03:32,350
stuck.

2769
02:03:32,350 --> 02:03:37,060
It's really crazy when you stop and 
think about the idea that up until 

2770
02:03:37,060 --> 02:03:41,140
whatever it was 14,000
years ago and the first people who 

2771
02:03:41,140 --> 02:03:41,500
wonder when did the Vikings get here?
Me,

2772
02:03:41,870 --> 02:03:46,870
the first year was the first humans here
in north for $14,000

2773
02:03:47,930 --> 02:03:49,000
was for as humans,
you know,

2774
02:03:49,040 --> 02:03:54,040
just think about these people that lived
like no one else in a big continent 

2775
02:03:54,891 --> 02:03:59,891
anywhere in the world.
They traveled the entire thing and they 

2776
02:03:59,891 --> 02:04:03,461
had all these little tribes and they 
were hunting and they were all living 

2777
02:04:03,461 --> 02:04:04,910
this crazy sort of hunting,
gathering lifestyle,

2778
02:04:04,911 --> 02:04:07,700
like an entire continent filled with 
people doing it.

2779
02:04:07,940 --> 02:04:09,990
It's really fascinating.
Now,

2780
02:04:10,100 --> 02:04:15,100
according to a lot of scholars,
they believe that there are 20 plus 

2781
02:04:15,100 --> 02:04:18,190
million,
a native American Buffalo.

2782
02:04:18,390 --> 02:04:19,160
You know,
when you,

2783
02:04:19,161 --> 02:04:24,161
uh,
though the episode that you shot wild 

2784
02:04:24,161 --> 02:04:27,031
buffalo in Mexico.
That was a fascinating episode and it 

2785
02:04:27,031 --> 02:04:28,580
made me really stop and think about 
what,

2786
02:04:28,840 --> 02:04:32,660
when you were describing the imagery of 
what it used to look like,

2787
02:04:32,690 --> 02:04:35,870
seeing buffaloes roam across the 
country,

2788
02:04:35,871 --> 02:04:37,980
that they would be like,
like

2789
02:04:37,980 --> 02:04:42,980
the shadows from giant clouds,
just like the entire land would be 

2790
02:04:42,980 --> 02:04:45,780
covered in buffalo.
And this is how it was for these fucking

2791
02:04:45,781 --> 02:04:48,780
people that lived here for what,
10,000

2792
02:04:48,781 --> 02:04:50,640
years or something from whenever the 
water.

2793
02:04:50,641 --> 02:04:55,320
The ice thawed and became the Great 
Lakes experience in apocalypse of sorts.

2794
02:04:56,320 --> 02:04:57,960
It wasn't a fucking Avatar.
It's the,

2795
02:04:57,961 --> 02:04:59,250
it's the avatar movie.
I mean,

2796
02:04:59,251 --> 02:05:00,660
it really is.
It's crazy shit.

2797
02:05:00,960 --> 02:05:05,960
If you really stop and think about the 
fact that the entire continent have all 

2798
02:05:05,960 --> 02:05:08,730
these people living this well we think 
of is like a very romantic life,

2799
02:05:08,970 --> 02:05:10,750
you know,
campaign with leather,

2800
02:05:10,830 --> 02:05:15,830
tps and shit and out there making fire 
and dance in and hunting and it's pretty

2801
02:05:16,801 --> 02:05:21,801
nuts.
The rest of the country shooting canon 

2802
02:05:21,801 --> 02:05:21,801
balls off a boats and you know what I 
mean?

2803
02:05:21,801 --> 02:05:25,881
They're fucking,
they're developing eyeglasses and 

2804
02:05:25,881 --> 02:05:30,320
navigating the seas and giant hamp sales
and medicine and these fucking people 

2805
02:05:30,961 --> 02:05:34,500
arrived around even riding on horses.
Right?

2806
02:05:34,530 --> 02:05:36,360
It's like they weren't even until the 
Spaniards came.

2807
02:05:36,361 --> 02:05:36,630
Right.

2808
02:05:36,840 --> 02:05:41,840
It's funny that so many,
so many guys that hunt become interested

2809
02:05:42,961 --> 02:05:43,410
in,
in,

2810
02:05:43,411 --> 02:05:48,411
in like early cultures and it's obvious 
that if you'd like to hunt animals,

2811
02:05:48,541 --> 02:05:50,940
you become interested in hunter gatherer
societies,

2812
02:05:50,941 --> 02:05:53,730
you know,
but just to look at it,

2813
02:05:53,760 --> 02:05:58,760
not from that,
just from like how great the hunting 

2814
02:05:58,760 --> 02:05:58,760
most of bad,
but look at it from other aspects.

2815
02:05:58,760 --> 02:06:01,440
Just like to live like,
like the with the plains Indians.

2816
02:06:01,470 --> 02:06:06,470
The proximity to death is you cannot,
unless you're living in the most war 

2817
02:06:07,111 --> 02:06:12,111
torn region of the world today,
you probably can't fathom the proximity 

2818
02:06:12,111 --> 02:06:13,030
to death that you lived around.
Yeah.

2819
02:06:13,440 --> 02:06:14,760
That you could.
It's so weird now.

2820
02:06:14,761 --> 02:06:19,761
Like our culture is so easy and so soft.
I always meet people who are in their 

2821
02:06:19,761 --> 02:06:21,750
thirties and forties and I'll be like,
I've never seen a dead person.

2822
02:06:22,950 --> 02:06:26,730
Like you can go through life and not lay
eyes on a dead person.

2823
02:06:26,770 --> 02:06:30,330
I didn't see a dead person.
I think like real close up until um,

2824
02:06:30,400 --> 02:06:35,400
my grandfather died and then he was a,
they embalmed him so it didn't even seem

2825
02:06:35,471 --> 02:06:40,471
real at all.
They had makeup on him and it's really 

2826
02:06:40,471 --> 02:06:41,860
strange.
I didn't recognize my grandfather in.

2827
02:06:41,990 --> 02:06:46,990
They're hard as a rock and then they 
just seem like these weird empty vessels

2828
02:06:47,050 --> 02:06:48,110
because what they,
what they do is what,

2829
02:06:48,190 --> 02:06:49,810
don't they suck you dry.
I mean,

2830
02:06:49,870 --> 02:06:50,560
yeah,
they drain,

2831
02:06:50,561 --> 02:06:53,710
you name it and then they,
they use formaldehyde I guess,

2832
02:06:53,711 --> 02:06:56,080
and do fluid or whatever.
I mean they do,

2833
02:06:56,081 --> 02:07:01,081
don't.
They do it with like an IV drip or some 

2834
02:07:01,081 --> 02:07:03,361
shit like that.
I don't know how they get in the veins 

2835
02:07:03,361 --> 02:07:04,670
of the formaldehyde.
Yeah,

2836
02:07:04,690 --> 02:07:07,240
it's fucking gross out in the woods,
man.

2837
02:07:07,241 --> 02:07:12,241
That's what I'd like them all.
So have you ever seen the Tibetans sky 

2838
02:07:12,241 --> 02:07:13,930
burial?
Jamie put up,

2839
02:07:13,931 --> 02:07:16,540
pull up some images of Tibetans,
sky burial.

2840
02:07:16,780 --> 02:07:19,450
What they do is they take a body and 
they uh,

2841
02:07:19,451 --> 02:07:20,660
they,
they quarter it,

2842
02:07:20,661 --> 02:07:25,661
they chop it up,
they smash the bones down and then they 

2843
02:07:25,661 --> 02:07:29,791
leave it out there for the vultures.
Vultures come in there and essentially 

2844
02:07:29,791 --> 02:07:32,650
pick everything clean if like I could 
trust my brothers to do it.

2845
02:07:32,680 --> 02:07:34,990
Like I just trust them implicitly,
but there'll be,

2846
02:07:35,260 --> 02:07:35,980
they're older than me so

2847
02:07:35,980 --> 02:07:40,980
they'd be too old.
But I'd be like if I knew someone I 

2848
02:07:40,980 --> 02:07:40,980
could really trust and I said when I 
die,

2849
02:07:40,980 --> 02:07:45,481
I want you to just take my body out to 
like a lot of bears and stuff and just 

2850
02:07:46,060 --> 02:07:48,340
chop it up real good and just stir it 
into the ground,

2851
02:07:50,080 --> 02:07:51,310
you know?
And that way,

2852
02:07:51,311 --> 02:07:56,311
even though it'd be dead,
wouldn't even know what actually 

2853
02:07:56,311 --> 02:07:56,311
happened.
It would just be nice to have it be the,

2854
02:07:56,311 --> 02:07:59,050
as I was dying to be like that,
that,

2855
02:07:59,060 --> 02:08:04,060
that will happen to you even want to be 
a chopped up because you don't want 

2856
02:08:04,060 --> 02:08:05,310
people still remains a call nine one one
and say,

2857
02:08:05,340 --> 02:08:07,570
oh yeah,
if they just leave you out there,

2858
02:08:07,571 --> 02:08:12,571
it's like someone's gonna find you.
They're going to go out there and be a 

2859
02:08:12,571 --> 02:08:12,571
big investigation and you know what I 
mean?

2860
02:08:12,571 --> 02:08:17,560
Question about finding animals,
about finding dead mountain lions and 

2861
02:08:17,560 --> 02:08:21,490
bears.
Is that because when they know they're 

2862
02:08:21,490 --> 02:08:21,490
going to die,
they go somewhere and squirrely and like

2863
02:08:21,490 --> 02:08:21,900
tuck away.
We're noticing.

2864
02:08:22,540 --> 02:08:23,730
Is that it or is it.
That's.

2865
02:08:23,860 --> 02:08:25,030
Oh,
you see him when you get,

2866
02:08:25,060 --> 02:08:27,490
when you get a bad hit on an animal.
Right,

2867
02:08:27,491 --> 02:08:27,880
right,
right.

2868
02:08:27,881 --> 02:08:29,530
And you get a bad hit an animal.
And if he'd go,

2869
02:08:29,620 --> 02:08:30,540
if you,
if uh,

2870
02:08:30,541 --> 02:08:32,530
if you get to hit on an animal,
the bow or you know,

2871
02:08:32,710 --> 02:08:37,240
firearm and he lives beyond that initial
rush.

2872
02:08:39,200 --> 02:08:40,970
They're usually gonna die tucked away 
somewhere.

2873
02:08:41,090 --> 02:08:42,510
They go into the thick stuff.
Yeah.

2874
02:08:42,540 --> 02:08:43,370
You know,
under,

2875
02:08:43,371 --> 02:08:48,371
like the,
you'll find stuff tucked up under 

2876
02:08:48,371 --> 02:08:48,510
juniper's.
I'll just do this year after we went out

2877
02:08:48,511 --> 02:08:51,130
and hunted deer,
Montana and found where a,

2878
02:08:51,350 --> 02:08:55,260
a really beautiful big bark.
Um,

2879
02:08:55,640 --> 02:09:00,640
I'll just happen to stumble into it,
but he had obviously I feel like he'd 

2880
02:09:00,640 --> 02:09:03,050
been hit because he had a,
he had a perforated antler.

2881
02:09:04,400 --> 02:09:05,390
Someone had shy.
Um,

2882
02:09:05,391 --> 02:09:05,960
I,
my,

2883
02:09:05,990 --> 02:09:10,990
my take home,
someone had shot at him and hit that 

2884
02:09:10,990 --> 02:09:10,990
antler where the bullet,
because he had a,

2885
02:09:11,130 --> 02:09:15,050
he had a big bullet type wound on his 
aunt or like a,

2886
02:09:15,080 --> 02:09:20,080
like a,
like would bullet hidden would but it 

2887
02:09:20,080 --> 02:09:21,050
had cracked his skull plate so it didn't
kill them immediately.

2888
02:09:21,320 --> 02:09:25,100
But he was so tucked up under this 
juniper Bush just,

2889
02:09:25,130 --> 02:09:28,190
he just laid up onto there to hide.
Like he knew he was vulnerable,

2890
02:09:28,490 --> 02:09:31,250
just died up there.
And I think it happens all the time,

2891
02:09:31,251 --> 02:09:31,490
man.

2892
02:09:31,660 --> 02:09:33,090
No,
it seems to make sense.

2893
02:09:33,320 --> 02:09:35,790
Especially a hug cause they don't want 
to get hit by a predator.

2894
02:09:35,791 --> 02:09:36,840
They know they're down,
you know.

2895
02:09:37,020 --> 02:09:38,810
But what about what a,
like predators,

2896
02:09:39,120 --> 02:09:41,520
like bears are big cats.
You know,

2897
02:09:41,521 --> 02:09:42,760
I've found bear,
I found

2898
02:09:42,820 --> 02:09:47,820
bear schools and I can't,
I've never found a like a fresh dead 

2899
02:09:49,421 --> 02:09:52,810
enough barrier to really tell it what 
its positioning was when it was dead,

2900
02:09:52,811 --> 02:09:57,811
but I found a number of like remains of 
bears but never where I knew that it 

2901
02:09:57,811 --> 02:09:59,560
that like this is it spot it had gone 
to,

2902
02:09:59,770 --> 02:10:00,640
but like I said,
when you get it,

2903
02:10:00,660 --> 02:10:03,820
if you get a hit on something with a 
ball and you don't kill me,

2904
02:10:03,821 --> 02:10:08,821
like you may be hitting liver,
hit it somewhere was going to live a 

2905
02:10:08,821 --> 02:10:08,821
little while.
When you find it,

2906
02:10:08,821 --> 02:10:09,970
you'll generally find it where it didn't
die on the run.

2907
02:10:10,030 --> 02:10:12,070
It laid down and died and when they laid
down,

2908
02:10:12,390 --> 02:10:17,390
they're usually pretty careful to get 
tucked away somewhere when it can be 

2909
02:10:17,390 --> 02:10:17,390
tough to find stuff.

2910
02:10:17,390 --> 02:10:18,910
When an animal like this diocese,
deer dies of it,

2911
02:10:18,911 --> 02:10:21,130
left his body behind would eventually 
something to eat.

2912
02:10:21,131 --> 02:10:22,560
The bones of the head,
you know,

2913
02:10:22,570 --> 02:10:22,690
you

2914
02:10:22,690 --> 02:10:27,370
wind up with is you wind up with a.
You wind up with this right here.

2915
02:10:27,460 --> 02:10:29,780
Oftentimes the base.
Yup.

2916
02:10:30,190 --> 02:10:33,910
This is real thick.
You'll delete this one

2917
02:10:34,010 --> 02:10:34,430
time.
Just,

2918
02:10:34,460 --> 02:10:36,830
I remember one time for the folks at 
home that are listening,

2919
02:10:37,010 --> 02:10:42,010
what would he.
We're talking about the base of a deer 

2920
02:10:42,010 --> 02:10:42,010
skull,
so that gets the base is the hard spot,

2921
02:10:42,120 --> 02:10:45,110
but around that frame and see that more 
than anything else

2922
02:10:45,140 --> 02:10:45,860
you see like,

2923
02:10:47,220 --> 02:10:50,340
can I get this where you see the problem
is most people are listening and they're

2924
02:10:50,360 --> 02:10:55,360
not just people are getting this off 
itunes or like listening to it on 

2925
02:10:55,360 --> 02:10:56,820
Sirius.
So the part on a um,

2926
02:10:56,821 --> 02:10:56,840
um,

2927
02:10:57,670 --> 02:11:00,370
the part you find most often when you 
see like a kill,

2928
02:11:00,390 --> 02:11:05,390
it's been consumers,
you find where the spinal cord enters 

2929
02:11:05,390 --> 02:11:09,451
the skull,
that thick bone area right there 

2930
02:11:09,451 --> 02:11:12,811
extending up into,
around the base of the antlers running 

2931
02:11:12,811 --> 02:11:15,270
non antlered game around horned game,
extending up to what would be kind of 

2932
02:11:15,270 --> 02:11:18,460
the space between the ears is just a 
thick and doesn't get consumed.

2933
02:11:18,820 --> 02:11:22,720
But one time I remember we killed my 
brother and I killed a cow elk.

2934
02:11:24,150 --> 02:11:24,820
This is in,
uh,

2935
02:11:24,821 --> 02:11:29,821
in Montana,
southwest Montana in areas a lot of 

2936
02:11:29,821 --> 02:11:29,821
grizzlies.
We killed a cow elk and went back a week

2937
02:11:29,821 --> 02:11:34,210
later to see what had happened in 
grizzlies had been on it.

2938
02:11:35,080 --> 02:11:37,690
They had eaten the hide.
Whoa.

2939
02:11:38,150 --> 02:11:43,150
That eaten all the bones.
The only part we could find was just a 

2940
02:11:43,150 --> 02:11:47,521
disk of bone with the.
The center of the remaining piece of 

2941
02:11:47,621 --> 02:11:50,020
bone was where to spinal cord passes 
into the skull,

2942
02:11:50,050 --> 02:11:55,050
that heavy boned dairy,
the frame May and I think it was worth 

2943
02:11:55,050 --> 02:11:57,950
in a donut size chunk of bone like that 
and you could tell that it didn't just 

2944
02:11:57,950 --> 02:11:59,800
go away,
that it wasn't like a drug.

2945
02:11:59,800 --> 02:12:04,800
It's somewhere we couldn't find it 
because you could account for the all 

2946
02:12:04,800 --> 02:12:07,060
that hide and all that bone in.
The shit that was left.

2947
02:12:08,650 --> 02:12:11,860
It was all there and it was like a 
sounds cubs or something.

2948
02:12:11,861 --> 02:12:16,810
Got on it and it was all still there.
That trip we went and killed another elk

2949
02:12:17,740 --> 02:12:21,950
and pack that elk and when we went back 
up there later on,

2950
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:27,000
the same thing happened to that one.
Isn't it true that a grizzlies tend to 

2951
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:27,970
prefer meet?
That's kind of rotten to the.

2952
02:12:28,110 --> 02:12:30,370
Yeah.
People say like when it kills something,

2953
02:12:31,330 --> 02:12:34,990
when people watch a bear,
black bear or grizzly make a kill,

2954
02:12:34,991 --> 02:12:39,991
they'll,
they'll eat that soft tissue first so 

2955
02:12:39,991 --> 02:12:39,991
that they,
they rip his belly open,

2956
02:12:39,991 --> 02:12:40,630
lungs,
heart,

2957
02:12:40,720 --> 02:12:43,600
liver,
and generally it's like they'll,

2958
02:12:43,601 --> 02:12:47,200
what they'll do is when they covered 
with grass,

2959
02:12:47,500 --> 02:12:52,500
some people even say that somehow and it
covered a little bit of dirt or covered 

2960
02:12:52,500 --> 02:12:52,600
in grass aids decomposition.

2961
02:12:53,080 --> 02:12:55,090
Um,
and they'll lay around on it,

2962
02:12:55,930 --> 02:12:57,780
they dedicate on it,
you know,

2963
02:12:57,880 --> 02:13:00,930
other things.
And they'll eat it as bacteria.

2964
02:13:00,940 --> 02:13:02,020
They don't,
they don't.

2965
02:13:02,021 --> 02:13:07,021
Generally,
they don't generally kill it and 

2966
02:13:07,021 --> 02:13:08,440
immediately started eating red meat 
alliance differently.

2967
02:13:08,441 --> 02:13:10,360
Lions don't like all that rotten meat 
lines,

2968
02:13:10,361 --> 02:13:12,190
like fresh stuff.
It's like the bears like,

2969
02:13:12,250 --> 02:13:15,250
bears like pretty like pretty rotten 
stuff,

2970
02:13:15,251 --> 02:13:16,040
man.
You,

2971
02:13:16,060 --> 02:13:17,840
I remember one time being,
being again,

2972
02:13:18,060 --> 02:13:23,060
we're remember what we were doing.
We were hunting for something or 

2973
02:13:23,060 --> 02:13:23,260
another.
And on Prince of Wales Island,

2974
02:13:23,261 --> 02:13:26,440
am I the shack we own?
I remember watching the wolves.

2975
02:13:26,890 --> 02:13:28,930
You think a wolves like eating fresh 
meat everyday.

2976
02:13:28,970 --> 02:13:33,970
You will throughout the year.
It takes pounds of meat a day to keep 

2977
02:13:33,970 --> 02:13:34,950
that thing alive.
But we sat there watching,

2978
02:13:35,400 --> 02:13:38,790
we sat there watching for wolves,
eating salmon.

2979
02:13:38,791 --> 02:13:43,791
This is after the spawning room,
this isn't a fall and they're eating 

2980
02:13:43,791 --> 02:13:46,080
salmon that are so rotten that they're 
in a putting like consistency of putting

2981
02:13:46,081 --> 02:13:51,081
lake state and just putrid like I can't 
even imagine like putrid,

2982
02:13:52,561 --> 02:13:57,561
like it would take it if you walk 
through one of these areas that one of 

2983
02:13:57,561 --> 02:13:58,470
these stream miles where all these sam,
we're laying dead.

2984
02:13:59,340 --> 02:14:00,630
I have a strong stomach.
It would,

2985
02:14:00,660 --> 02:14:03,000
I would need an hour or two before I 
could eat.

2986
02:14:03,660 --> 02:14:08,660
Really.
It was just overpowering and watching 

2987
02:14:08,660 --> 02:14:10,740
these wolves basically lapping up San 
and soup,

2988
02:14:10,950 --> 02:14:13,740
putting like salmon or Ryan to uh,
putting leg and says,

2989
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:16,950
I can try to be an animal as I can.
Like,

2990
02:14:17,160 --> 02:14:19,560
try to think like an animal.
An animal becomes animalistic.

2991
02:14:19,890 --> 02:14:24,890
Now you need serious enzymes in your 
stomach and mouth to handle that.

2992
02:14:25,840 --> 02:14:29,830
Not get sick.
Do it's a mystery there.

2993
02:14:29,870 --> 02:14:32,270
Like the cleanup crew,
the bears,

2994
02:14:32,320 --> 02:14:35,310
like the cleanup crew,
your bones like that.

2995
02:14:36,880 --> 02:14:39,580
Just eat everything swelled to say like,
like hiring.

2996
02:14:39,581 --> 02:14:40,450
As you know,
there's like a,

2997
02:14:40,470 --> 02:14:44,330
there's a relationship that a 
relationship,

2998
02:14:44,370 --> 02:14:48,300
an Africa between like Cheetahs and 
hyenas where she doesn't make a kill,

2999
02:14:48,330 --> 02:14:53,330
they can't cross the bone and in Hyannis
and go in and hang out and wait because 

3000
02:14:54,091 --> 02:14:59,091
they know that when that's done,
there'll be the first in their nose and 

3001
02:14:59,091 --> 02:15:00,030
they can crush bones and I remember,
I don't know if this theory is in in,

3002
02:15:00,031 --> 02:15:05,031
in fashion anymore,
but it used to be in fashion that early 

3003
02:15:05,031 --> 02:15:09,561
hominids like early humans seem to 
appear in the fossil record outside of 

3004
02:15:11,731 --> 02:15:16,731
Africa at a time that was 
contemporaneous with the appearance of 

3005
02:15:17,011 --> 02:15:18,030
Saber tooth cats.

3006
02:15:19,140 --> 02:15:24,140
The thinking being that that the saber 
tooth cats weren't able to crush bone 

3007
02:15:24,390 --> 02:15:26,290
because of the makeup of their dental 
structure.

3008
02:15:26,310 --> 02:15:31,310
Teeth.
They couldn't crush bone and they were 

3009
02:15:31,310 --> 02:15:33,531
really effective predators and people 
have become a cost on the following 

3010
02:15:33,531 --> 02:15:35,880
saber tooth cats to scavenge bone marrow
and things that they left behind.

3011
02:15:37,290 --> 02:15:39,550
I read this long ago,
I don't know if that's been hard,

3012
02:15:39,840 --> 02:15:42,320
but other funds can't be.
No,

3013
02:15:42,321 --> 02:15:47,321
but I mean just that they're there.
They're leaving kills out there and if 

3014
02:15:47,321 --> 02:15:48,330
you're like,
if you're the term Apex Predator,

3015
02:15:49,230 --> 02:15:51,360
there's a lot of benefits to being the 
apex scavenger,

3016
02:15:51,870 --> 02:15:56,250
which is after the top dog does what 
he's going to do.

3017
02:15:56,251 --> 02:15:58,170
Who gets to be there first,
right?

3018
02:15:58,171 --> 02:15:59,850
How much can they eat of an elk?
Yeah.

3019
02:15:59,851 --> 02:16:01,950
So like the wolves,
Kyla,

3020
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,810
if wolves kill an elk and get what they 
want off.

3021
02:16:04,860 --> 02:16:09,860
It was a big benefit to whoever comes 
along behind who's ever the second roll 

3022
02:16:10,270 --> 02:16:15,270
up.
And it's the little guys that come 

3023
02:16:15,270 --> 02:16:15,270
later,
you know what I mean?

3024
02:16:15,270 --> 02:16:18,310
Little guys later.
But first it was like a coyote hang in 

3025
02:16:18,310 --> 02:16:18,310
there and he's like,
when he's done,

3026
02:16:18,310 --> 02:16:19,650
I'm in there man.
And then you guys get in line behind me.

3027
02:16:19,651 --> 02:16:24,651
You know,
it's fascinating that there's a balance 

3028
02:16:24,651 --> 02:16:24,651
of that system that the wolves want the 
fresh meat,

3029
02:16:24,651 --> 02:16:25,330
but the bears want the rotten meat and 
you know,

3030
02:16:25,440 --> 02:16:30,210
it's really interesting.
It's amazing how the system is covered.

3031
02:16:30,260 --> 02:16:32,290
Got All the bases covered.
The,

3032
02:16:32,291 --> 02:16:33,910
uh,
the way the area where we were,

3033
02:16:33,920 --> 02:16:38,920
the breaks,
the Missouri River was like the most 

3034
02:16:38,920 --> 02:16:41,230
hostile place for life I think.
Uh,

3035
02:16:41,280 --> 02:16:42,340
I've ever been

3036
02:16:42,460 --> 02:16:46,670
to be cold,
wickedly hot and not much to eat.

3037
02:16:47,340 --> 02:16:52,340
Not much.
They're people that it was a place for 

3038
02:16:52,340 --> 02:16:52,790
a,
it was a place for carnivores,

3039
02:16:52,791 --> 02:16:53,360
man.
You know what I mean?

3040
02:16:53,361 --> 02:16:55,160
There's so,
there's some edible wild plants,

3041
02:16:55,161 --> 02:16:57,960
but the people in there would go in 
there and in,

3042
02:16:57,980 --> 02:16:58,530
in,
in,

3043
02:16:58,850 --> 02:17:00,050
in a historical.
I mean like,

3044
02:17:00,120 --> 02:17:05,120
you know,
Lewis and Clark went through there and 

3045
02:17:05,120 --> 02:17:06,470
generally people traveling through there
would um,

3046
02:17:07,190 --> 02:17:11,420
have fantastic luck with hunting.
You know,

3047
02:17:11,480 --> 02:17:14,000
it doesn't look like it's still,
it's still got a lot of animals today,

3048
02:17:14,270 --> 02:17:17,480
but something about that river.
It was just game down there,

3049
02:17:17,481 --> 02:17:18,770
you know,
things went through there.

3050
02:17:18,771 --> 02:17:22,010
There's not a lot of water in that area,
so it's reliable place to find water.

3051
02:17:22,400 --> 02:17:25,370
It's good.
It's a great place for hunting and other

3052
02:17:25,371 --> 02:17:30,371
things.
A lot of agricultural practices and 

3053
02:17:30,371 --> 02:17:30,371
stuff.
Not so great and it's always been,

3054
02:17:30,371 --> 02:17:31,760
it's always been a hunter,
like a place for hunter gathers.

3055
02:17:31,880 --> 02:17:36,880
You weren't clued me into what it used 
to be that it used to be a gigantic 

3056
02:17:36,880 --> 02:17:40,151
ocean and now that is really crazy.
I'd heard of them finding a fossilized,

3057
02:17:41,001 --> 02:17:46,001
uh,
ancient teeth of different fish and I 

3058
02:17:46,001 --> 02:17:48,281
think one of the shells we were fine and
I was convinced it was a mining 

3059
02:17:48,471 --> 02:17:53,471
operation was dead serious.
Like see those hills that's reminding.

3060
02:17:54,170 --> 02:17:55,040
Oh no,
man,

3061
02:17:55,041 --> 02:17:57,930
this river here,
the reason that run over here,

3062
02:17:58,070 --> 02:17:59,800
the mining expert,
Brian County,

3063
02:17:59,930 --> 02:18:02,330
that's a classic example of me when I 
get a little excited.

3064
02:18:02,331 --> 02:18:04,040
I'm like,
I know everything.

3065
02:18:04,070 --> 02:18:05,540
Those are track marks,
but.

3066
02:18:05,570 --> 02:18:06,460
But it is interesting too

3067
02:18:06,490 --> 02:18:11,490
called the breaks because it was that 
you're on the bench of the Great Plains 

3068
02:18:11,851 --> 02:18:16,851
in the Missouri breaks is where the 
landscape seems to break and crumble 

3069
02:18:16,851 --> 02:18:21,571
away down into the canyon and the 
Missouri River and it's just like deeply

3070
02:18:23,681 --> 02:18:25,030
incised.
Yeah,

3071
02:18:25,080 --> 02:18:25,450
there you go.

3072
02:18:25,540 --> 02:18:27,190
Yeah.
It was a fascinating place,

3073
02:18:27,191 --> 02:18:29,000
man,
of what the folks don't.

3074
02:18:29,080 --> 02:18:34,080
If you don't see this,
there's these grey hills and it's 

3075
02:18:34,080 --> 02:18:35,830
basically these gigantic mountains of 
silt.

3076
02:18:36,130 --> 02:18:41,130
And what's really weird is there's like 
patches of timber and stuff inside of 

3077
02:18:41,130 --> 02:18:41,130
them,
but as you're climbing it,

3078
02:18:41,130 --> 02:18:45,820
like especially after it's rained,
it's all mud clay.

3079
02:18:45,880 --> 02:18:47,930
Yeah.
It's this weird heavy clays.

3080
02:18:48,320 --> 02:18:49,850
They call it.
It's an expandable clay.

3081
02:18:49,851 --> 02:18:54,851
It gets wet and swells and it does seem 
you'd look at it like you look at the 

3082
02:18:54,851 --> 02:18:57,710
brakes from the water and it feels like 
use the term loosely,

3083
02:18:57,711 --> 02:18:59,570
but it feels like you're in the 
mountains mountainous,

3084
02:18:59,730 --> 02:19:01,130
but it's almost like the opposite of 
mountains.

3085
02:19:02,270 --> 02:19:05,540
Mountains would be something that rose 
up the geologic pressures.

3086
02:19:05,541 --> 02:19:08,030
It pushed up,
but the breaks is the absence of.

3087
02:19:08,400 --> 02:19:13,400
It's like the absence of,
of topsoil is something was like washed 

3088
02:19:13,400 --> 02:19:14,240
away.
So one of the Grand Canyon,

3089
02:19:14,241 --> 02:19:16,280
like the Grand Canyon is a very rugged 
place,

3090
02:19:16,281 --> 02:19:18,410
but it's just because you.
Not that you add in stuff,

3091
02:19:18,411 --> 02:19:22,250
you took stuff away.
Don't climb that stuff like I eat.

3092
02:19:22,670 --> 02:19:25,370
I looked back at how much ground me and 
Ryan had covered.

3093
02:19:25,380 --> 02:19:27,980
It was like a lot like even be.
It doesn't seem

3094
02:19:27,980 --> 02:19:32,980
like climbing to the top of that 
mountain or whatever it was in front of 

3095
02:19:32,980 --> 02:19:33,350
you and you could because you could get 
a foothold that way.

3096
02:19:35,770 --> 02:19:39,560
But one of the things that I just 
realized how difficult it is to actually

3097
02:19:39,561 --> 02:19:43,130
keep warm unless you're moving.
But when you start moving,

3098
02:19:43,220 --> 02:19:45,110
you know,
and you're outside,

3099
02:19:45,230 --> 02:19:46,430
it kicks your ass.
I mean,

3100
02:19:46,431 --> 02:19:48,190
did you spend a lot of time cold or are 
you,

3101
02:19:48,191 --> 02:19:49,440
you seem like you're.
No,

3102
02:19:49,450 --> 02:19:51,080
no,
I get cold and that's the thing.

3103
02:19:51,260 --> 02:19:53,900
That's just a basic survival element

3104
02:19:54,890 --> 02:19:55,250
that

3105
02:19:57,130 --> 02:20:01,520
it's like when you're out and in 
conditions are poor and you have,

3106
02:20:01,920 --> 02:20:04,320
you know,
especially cold with some humidity.

3107
02:20:04,321 --> 02:20:09,321
Like it was overcast,
it was a little bit wet feeling even 

3108
02:20:09,321 --> 02:20:09,321
though it's a very arid,
dry area,

3109
02:20:09,321 --> 02:20:09,920
it was a little bit.
There's a lot of humidity on a trip.

3110
02:20:10,700 --> 02:20:13,160
It's just like the only time you were in
your out and moving.

3111
02:20:13,910 --> 02:20:18,910
But it's a little bit paradoxical 
because when you get cold and 

3112
02:20:18,910 --> 02:20:21,780
uncomfortable,
your inclination is to huddle into 

3113
02:20:21,780 --> 02:20:21,780
yourself,
you know?

3114
02:20:21,780 --> 02:20:24,350
And so it's like harder to get out of 
your bag in the morning.

3115
02:20:24,610 --> 02:20:27,710
You're kind of like paralyzed by the 
cold and paralyzed by the young,

3116
02:20:27,860 --> 02:20:32,860
like how uncomfortable you are.
But you'll notice that the minute you 

3117
02:20:32,860 --> 02:20:35,291
start hiking up a hill,
you feel great and you can be out there 

3118
02:20:35,291 --> 02:20:37,610
all day and you're having a good time 
and you stopped and you feel like hell.

3119
02:20:37,640 --> 02:20:39,310
And when you feel like hell,
it gets.

3120
02:20:39,311 --> 02:20:41,310
It's hard to get motivated to do it 
again.

3121
02:20:41,311 --> 02:20:46,311
And I think that something that comes 
from spending a lot of time on 

3122
02:20:46,311 --> 02:20:48,960
comfortable,
it's just you get in your head that you 

3123
02:20:48,960 --> 02:20:48,960
just got to move.
And,

3124
02:20:48,960 --> 02:20:50,660
and I think that when it's really cold 
weather,

3125
02:20:50,900 --> 02:20:52,370
you try not to do anything.

3126
02:20:53,140 --> 02:20:58,140
Sydney,
you get up in the morning and you go 

3127
02:20:58,140 --> 02:20:58,140
immediately from your sleeping bag to be
moving.

3128
02:20:58,140 --> 02:20:59,260
When it's time to eat you to stop for a 
minute and eat while moving.

3129
02:20:59,261 --> 02:21:03,870
You never stopped for mealtime.
You this man,

3130
02:21:04,370 --> 02:21:06,360
the only way you're going to be able to 
deal with over time,

3131
02:21:06,370 --> 02:21:08,280
you'll feel cold and you feel great.
And yeah,

3132
02:21:08,650 --> 02:21:13,650
one of the things that we talked about 
when we did this trip was that I was 

3133
02:21:13,650 --> 02:21:16,771
never like tired during the day or I 
wanted to take a nap or something very 

3134
02:21:16,771 --> 02:21:21,150
different than the um.
The the idea of getting up in the 

3135
02:21:21,150 --> 02:21:24,421
morning and just hiking around all day,
but yet all the time completely alert 

3136
02:21:24,790 --> 02:21:28,030
all the time completely.
Like we were wide awake.

3137
02:21:28,240 --> 02:21:29,450
Whereas like,
you know,

3138
02:21:29,520 --> 02:21:34,520
if you're,
you have a regular job or whatever you 

3139
02:21:34,520 --> 02:21:34,520
do after five or six hours,
you're like,

3140
02:21:34,520 --> 02:21:34,860
oh,
get me the fuck outta here.

3141
02:21:35,520 --> 02:21:39,070
You start yawning and stretching.
I didn't ever feel like I needed to take

3142
02:21:39,071 --> 02:21:42,010
a nap and we got to this really weird 
regular cycle.

3143
02:21:42,080 --> 02:21:45,040
We're going to bed at like 8:00
and that will go right to sleep.

3144
02:21:45,460 --> 02:21:50,460
And I'd wake up early and he was like,
it was like this weird sort of natural 

3145
02:21:50,460 --> 02:21:54,091
cycle that you.
First time we'd ever been living by 

3146
02:21:54,091 --> 02:21:54,091
natural light,
natural light,

3147
02:21:54,091 --> 02:21:57,430
but we weren't around any of our beeping
gadgets.

3148
02:21:57,490 --> 02:21:59,470
Not Wonder fast.
Fuck it.

3149
02:22:00,630 --> 02:22:01,820
I think it's a huge part.
I mean,

3150
02:22:01,840 --> 02:22:03,340
I think you find something,
um,

3151
02:22:04,080 --> 02:22:09,080
I mean just think about just in a,
in a setting like how much we were just 

3152
02:22:09,910 --> 02:22:13,330
like our physical beings.
We're shaped by that lifestyle,

3153
02:22:13,710 --> 02:22:14,140
you know,
of,

3154
02:22:14,190 --> 02:22:16,660
of operating according to daylight 
hours,

3155
02:22:16,810 --> 02:22:18,730
you know,
being out in search of food.

3156
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:19,870
I don't mean to get it,
you know what I mean?

3157
02:22:19,871 --> 02:22:20,280
To get out like,

3158
02:22:21,060 --> 02:22:22,110
you know,

3159
02:22:23,630 --> 02:22:28,630
new age.
I don't don't mean to get all like 

3160
02:22:28,630 --> 02:22:28,630
nostalgia

3161
02:22:28,630 --> 02:22:28,630
and new age.
Those are good words for it,

3162
02:22:28,630 --> 02:22:31,530
but when you're out doing that kind of 
thing,

3163
02:22:31,531 --> 02:22:33,750
you're out.
Like hunting on the land,

3164
02:22:33,751 --> 02:22:35,940
using your senses,
looking for food,

3165
02:22:36,300 --> 02:22:39,870
you,
you start making sense to yourself,

3166
02:22:40,550 --> 02:22:42,110
you know,
I think you,

3167
02:22:42,180 --> 02:22:47,180
you can be like,
it's safe to say that there's something 

3168
02:22:47,180 --> 02:22:47,180
about me that really thrives on this.
You know?

3169
02:22:47,180 --> 02:22:49,650
It's like there's something about me 
that just likes this kind of energy.

3170
02:22:49,830 --> 02:22:50,880
I think most people find it

3171
02:22:51,150 --> 02:22:55,190
primal thing that's just ingrained in 
our system that from the hunter gatherer

3172
02:22:55,191 --> 02:22:57,710
days of,
or it's like all a part of us.

3173
02:22:57,720 --> 02:22:59,210
I think there's,
I mean,

3174
02:22:59,220 --> 02:23:01,050
just think about what we know about just
like,

3175
02:23:01,490 --> 02:23:03,150
you know,
selective pressures.

3176
02:23:03,180 --> 02:23:08,180
There's an enormous amount of selective 
pressure and being able to do that kind 

3177
02:23:08,180 --> 02:23:09,210
of stuff.
I think that now people would argue that

3178
02:23:09,250 --> 02:23:14,250
the new life we have now in technology,
we were under new kinds of selective 

3179
02:23:14,250 --> 02:23:14,250
pressures.
You know,

3180
02:23:14,250 --> 02:23:16,710
there's probably right now those of us 
who are going to thrive,

3181
02:23:17,220 --> 02:23:18,020
you know,
um,

3182
02:23:18,300 --> 02:23:20,520
those,
those are going to thrive or are adapted

3183
02:23:20,521 --> 02:23:22,370
to a technological society.
But now it's not,

3184
02:23:22,380 --> 02:23:24,560
it's not tied in now to birth,
you know,

3185
02:23:24,561 --> 02:23:28,500
it used to be that we had such low life 
expectancies and high mortality rates.

3186
02:23:28,740 --> 02:23:33,740
Those are the people that could thrive.
Really good hunters were the ones that 

3187
02:23:33,740 --> 02:23:34,380
were having that access to females.
They had young.

3188
02:23:34,710 --> 02:23:39,710
Now it's kind of a given that you're 
going to have reproductive 

3189
02:23:39,710 --> 02:23:40,880
possibilities,
you know,

3190
02:23:41,020 --> 02:23:46,020
you'd be the biggest loser in the world 
and not do anything and you still get 

3191
02:23:46,020 --> 02:23:49,251
people pregnant and have kids.
So I think that selective pressures 

3192
02:23:49,251 --> 02:23:49,251
don't work on this now like they used 
to,

3193
02:23:49,251 --> 02:23:51,680
but for a long time we are shaped by,
you know,

3194
02:23:51,681 --> 02:23:55,650
you had to be a productive member of 
your culture.

3195
02:23:55,651 --> 02:24:00,651
You had to be a productive member of 
your clan in order to have the kind of 

3196
02:24:00,651 --> 02:24:00,990
cache that was necessary to be able to 
breed women.

3197
02:24:01,250 --> 02:24:05,600
When I lived in Massachusetts was my 
fishing phase phase.

3198
02:24:05,601 --> 02:24:07,040
My childhood.
I go fishing everyday.

3199
02:24:07,090 --> 02:24:09,950
It was a member of the Bass Angler 
Sportsman Society,

3200
02:24:09,951 --> 02:24:14,951
the whole deal.
I spent all my free time fishing for a 

3201
02:24:14,951 --> 02:24:14,951
couple of years.
Loved it,

3202
02:24:14,951 --> 02:24:19,720
and it was.
There's some fucking visceral thrill I 

3203
02:24:19,720 --> 02:24:21,710
think of hooking one of my first fishes,
fishes.

3204
02:24:21,711 --> 02:24:22,790
I said fishes,
fish,

3205
02:24:22,791 --> 02:24:24,140
fish.
I know what it is,

3206
02:24:24,141 --> 02:24:28,670
stupid.
But the though that visceral thrill,

3207
02:24:28,700 --> 02:24:33,700
whatever it was,
it was so shocking to me that to this 

3208
02:24:33,700 --> 02:24:35,630
day,
like I'll look back and think of that.

3209
02:24:35,631 --> 02:24:40,631
I'm like,
that's got to be some like ancient DNA 

3210
02:24:40,631 --> 02:24:40,950
shit.
Like he got the fish was like,

3211
02:24:41,610 --> 02:24:43,410
you don't know what's going to come 
around the next corner.

3212
02:24:43,411 --> 02:24:48,411
And when I saw my first book,
I think it was the third day I got so 

3213
02:24:48,411 --> 02:24:49,790
excited because it from where I looked 
at,

3214
02:24:49,791 --> 02:24:54,350
it looked like it was a world record 
bucket at 50 point bucks.

3215
02:24:54,380 --> 02:24:59,380
Literally I went,
I was at a buck because buck and I had 

3216
02:24:59,380 --> 02:24:59,450
that.
I had nothing in my scope and it was,

3217
02:24:59,451 --> 02:25:04,451
my scope was moving around so much 
because I got so heated and adrenaline 

3218
02:25:04,451 --> 02:25:06,920
up that I had buck fever.
I could not shoot that deer.

3219
02:25:06,980 --> 02:25:07,750
Oh really?
No.

3220
02:25:07,760 --> 02:25:09,370
I was like,
Ryan had to grab it.

3221
02:25:09,371 --> 02:25:14,371
He was like,
you're going to injure a dog because I 

3222
02:25:14,371 --> 02:25:14,371
was going to start squeezing rounds off 
blindly,

3223
02:25:14,371 --> 02:25:15,110
which is wrong,
but I was so excited.

3224
02:25:15,410 --> 02:25:17,450
You know,
and then you get addicted to that.

3225
02:25:17,451 --> 02:25:18,980
Not only I have the other thing you 
going to take the two.

3226
02:25:18,990 --> 02:25:20,780
I think when you look,
when you glass,

3227
02:25:20,930 --> 02:25:24,000
when you take your binoculars and you're
looking out and for like an antler and

3228
02:25:24,010 --> 02:25:29,010
a year,
and then you start looking at things 

3229
02:25:29,010 --> 02:25:30,280
more intensely and differently,
like you have almost new eyes,

3230
02:25:30,281 --> 02:25:32,350
like you're looking at things,
you know,

3231
02:25:32,351 --> 02:25:34,030
the way you don't usually look at 
things,

3232
02:25:34,310 --> 02:25:38,080
paying attention to everything and I 
think that keeps you in a keys.

3233
02:25:38,081 --> 02:25:38,770
You in,
you just,

3234
02:25:38,820 --> 02:25:41,170
you start forgetting about yourself.
That's kind of refreshing

3235
02:25:41,310 --> 02:25:41,810
you.
Yeah.

3236
02:25:41,811 --> 02:25:46,811
You seize the t to look to look out,
to be on the look for game like you're 

3237
02:25:46,811 --> 02:25:51,811
out there.
A sense where you're looking for deer 

3238
02:25:51,811 --> 02:25:51,811
but use everything starts to pop to you.
Yeah,

3239
02:25:51,811 --> 02:25:53,050
because you're paying attention to 
things.

3240
02:25:53,080 --> 02:25:54,850
It also thing I think about all the 
time,

3241
02:25:54,880 --> 02:25:59,880
like in a place like the brakes.
It is because of the landscape might 

3242
02:25:59,880 --> 02:26:02,860
seem to some people redundant,
you know,

3243
02:26:03,040 --> 02:26:06,930
it's like a lot of the same thing.
It's just like roll upon row upon row of

3244
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:12,000
a hill that looks this way and sandstone
bluffs and it's like everything looks 

3245
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:15,751
the same,
but what you're looking for through all 

3246
02:26:15,751 --> 02:26:15,751
that,
it's just like little subtle differences

3247
02:26:15,751 --> 02:26:20,191
and I think it's like the lack of 
activity that sometimes helps you hone 

3248
02:26:20,441 --> 02:26:22,150
in and look at things much more 
carefully.

3249
02:26:22,470 --> 02:26:27,470
I think it'd be that if you,
if you ever notice if you walk into a 

3250
02:26:27,470 --> 02:26:27,790
really crowded,
I'm shopping center,

3251
02:26:27,791 --> 02:26:28,800
walk into like,
you know,

3252
02:26:28,801 --> 02:26:30,760
you're going to like walk through times 
square or something.

3253
02:26:31,120 --> 02:26:36,120
You get to the other end and he'd 
sometimes realize that you didn't ever 

3254
02:26:36,120 --> 02:26:36,490
actually really look at anything.
Yeah.

3255
02:26:36,910 --> 02:26:41,910
Because you were just in a miller,
it was so much you came away with 

3256
02:26:41,910 --> 02:26:42,580
impressions,
like a sense of noise,

3257
02:26:42,670 --> 02:26:44,680
a sense of what you saw,
like snippets,

3258
02:26:44,950 --> 02:26:49,950
but there's nothing that you ever like,
like detailed in on it and when you're 

3259
02:26:49,950 --> 02:26:53,671
in those places,
and I would argue that like the Arctic 

3260
02:26:53,671 --> 02:26:53,671
is a little bit this way.
I think,

3261
02:26:53,671 --> 02:26:55,060
you know,
areas of Montana this way.

3262
02:26:55,090 --> 02:26:57,520
It's just like a place that people might
look at and be like,

3263
02:26:57,521 --> 02:26:58,240
oh,
it's just nothing.

3264
02:26:58,940 --> 02:26:59,870
Just grass.
Right.

3265
02:27:00,220 --> 02:27:02,770
You know,
but when there's a deer out on that,

3266
02:27:02,800 --> 02:27:06,070
you can focus in on that thing and 
experienced that thing in a way that you

3267
02:27:06,071 --> 02:27:06,880
just don't get to do,

3268
02:27:07,070 --> 02:27:12,070
to an alien.
The difference between a human life 

3269
02:27:12,070 --> 02:27:16,300
living and walking through a mall.
That experience and the human out there 

3270
02:27:16,971 --> 02:27:21,971
on the brakes and the Missouri breaks.
Like you want to talk about two 

3271
02:27:21,971 --> 02:27:21,971
completely different.
Well,

3272
02:27:21,971 --> 02:27:24,120
yeah.
One Enrica says that he thinks that part

3273
02:27:24,130 --> 02:27:29,130
of part of maybe the epidemic of people 
who are have hyper vigilant a central 

3274
02:27:29,130 --> 02:27:33,341
nervous systems and our become like 
weirdly autistic might be that we're 

3275
02:27:33,341 --> 02:27:36,320
evolving because human beings today 
experience more stimulus in one day than

3276
02:27:36,321 --> 02:27:38,660
they did in a lifetime.
It only makes sense.

3277
02:27:39,340 --> 02:27:44,340
I mean how.
How else could you process the 

3278
02:27:44,340 --> 02:27:45,380
information that just comes from a 
television?

3279
02:27:45,680 --> 02:27:46,190
What?
What?

3280
02:27:46,340 --> 02:27:48,710
What?
What do you design to really see?

3281
02:27:49,100 --> 02:27:54,100
You're not really designed to sit in 
front of a fucking television take in 

3282
02:27:54,100 --> 02:27:54,560
Lord of the rings.
It's no,

3283
02:27:54,620 --> 02:27:56,540
that's.
You're not really designed for that.

3284
02:27:56,720 --> 02:28:01,720
That's all.
All these signals that are firing off 

3285
02:28:01,720 --> 02:28:02,640
your reward systems and getting your,
your dopamine levels and your.

3286
02:28:02,641 --> 02:28:06,110
Your adrenaline levels up and you 
getting engaged in the action.

3287
02:28:06,380 --> 02:28:07,880
That's a crazy thing.
It's like a.

3288
02:28:07,890 --> 02:28:11,240
it's almost like it's a step away from a
simulated reality,

3289
02:28:11,241 --> 02:28:12,820
but it's really moving in that 
direction.

3290
02:28:12,980 --> 02:28:17,980
You get these gigantic thrill rushes 
from a giant television.

3291
02:28:18,230 --> 02:28:20,150
It's really weird,
weird stuff.

3292
02:28:20,180 --> 02:28:22,340
When you stop and think the impact that 
it has

3293
02:28:22,550 --> 02:28:27,550
on the way we visualize our world 
because so many people visualize their 

3294
02:28:28,041 --> 02:28:30,410
world as if it's some sort of like a 
plot and a movie.

3295
02:28:30,420 --> 02:28:33,630
They see the whole thing like a plot of 
the movie.

3296
02:28:33,980 --> 02:28:34,520
When you're.

3297
02:28:34,880 --> 02:28:39,880
Did we talk about.
We talked about the Uda bombers 

3298
02:28:39,880 --> 02:28:43,091
manifesto.
Interesting elements that I remember I 

3299
02:28:43,091 --> 02:28:44,590
took this class.
I took this class in college called the,

3300
02:28:46,040 --> 02:28:47,390
I think it was called political 
rhetoric.

3301
02:28:47,391 --> 02:28:52,391
We read various pieces.
Everything from Martin Luther King that 

3302
02:28:52,391 --> 02:28:53,350
the unibomber and everybody had this 
point that I messed up.

3303
02:28:53,351 --> 02:28:55,070
This guy was.
He had just pointed out as resonate with

3304
02:28:55,071 --> 02:28:58,260
me where he talks about that,
that he.

3305
02:28:58,520 --> 02:29:01,550
He looked at levels of difficulty and 
there'd be.

3306
02:29:01,551 --> 02:29:03,260
I can't remember what way it went if it 
went up or down,

3307
02:29:03,261 --> 02:29:05,900
but let's just say as level one 
difficulty was like,

3308
02:29:05,930 --> 02:29:07,400
no matter how hard you try,
you'll fail.

3309
02:29:07,840 --> 02:29:09,500
Okay.
That's absolute difficult.

3310
02:29:10,380 --> 02:29:12,110
That'd be level two is like if you try 
super,

3311
02:29:12,111 --> 02:29:17,111
super hard,
you have a slight chance of success on 

3312
02:29:17,111 --> 02:29:18,110
down to.
If you don't try it all,

3313
02:29:18,111 --> 02:29:19,510
you're still succeed.
Okay,

3314
02:29:19,511 --> 02:29:21,950
it would be like these five levels of 
difficulty and he's like,

3315
02:29:21,980 --> 02:29:26,440
his gripe with technology was that 
technology had brought human existence,

3316
02:29:26,441 --> 02:29:27,530
tilt to the level five.

3317
02:29:27,980 --> 02:29:30,470
It's like you don't even have to try to 
succeed.

3318
02:29:30,590 --> 02:29:32,350
You're just going to be alive now 
because you're gonna,

3319
02:29:32,351 --> 02:29:33,770
you're gonna be alive,
will reproduce.

3320
02:29:34,040 --> 02:29:37,130
You don't need to do anything.
It's just you're just taking care of.

3321
02:29:37,370 --> 02:29:40,970
We've got food surpluses,
social safety nets,

3322
02:29:40,971 --> 02:29:41,480
everything,
you know,

3323
02:29:41,960 --> 02:29:44,070
and he argued that Omar,
like our,

3324
02:29:44,390 --> 02:29:49,390
as neurotic as he was,
he argued that all of our neuroses came 

3325
02:29:49,390 --> 02:29:52,691
from that.
All the energy we're supposed to be 

3326
02:29:52,691 --> 02:29:53,420
spending to maybe survive,
you know,

3327
02:29:54,590 --> 02:29:57,710
was just now spent running a muck in our
brain.

3328
02:29:58,680 --> 02:30:03,680
We couldn't handle the free.
We can't handle the free time the 

3329
02:30:03,680 --> 02:30:06,941
technology allows us and that's why he 
advocated for like this human being's 

3330
02:30:06,941 --> 02:30:09,820
definitely this reactionary existence 
where you can go back to like,

3331
02:30:10,020 --> 02:30:12,760
you know,
an agrarian environment.

3332
02:30:12,860 --> 02:30:13,270
Okay.
Just

3333
02:30:13,660 --> 02:30:16,170
try to get your black belt in Jujitsu 
though.

3334
02:30:16,310 --> 02:30:19,200
That's what I'm talking about.
The goals.

3335
02:30:19,680 --> 02:30:21,710
Yes.
You need tasks,

3336
02:30:21,740 --> 02:30:24,980
you need things to do.
I'm most happy when I'm going like this.

3337
02:30:26,960 --> 02:30:28,280
That's what I'm most happy when I'm 
going,

3338
02:30:28,740 --> 02:30:33,740
no,
I'm not involved in something or 

3339
02:30:33,740 --> 02:30:33,740
something's not stimulating me if 
something's not,

3340
02:30:33,740 --> 02:30:36,050
whether it's training,
doing something different,

3341
02:30:36,080 --> 02:30:41,080
trying something.
The hunting experience was a perfect 

3342
02:30:41,080 --> 02:30:43,721
example of that.
Like the ability to to go and do the 

3343
02:30:44,301 --> 02:30:49,301
show and you know,
you guys brought to the table with so 

3344
02:30:49,301 --> 02:30:51,050
much better than anything we could have 
ever come up with on our own.

3345
02:30:51,410 --> 02:30:55,580
I mean the idea that you were going to 
take us in this fucking five day camping

3346
02:30:55,581 --> 02:30:59,050
thing with no cell phones and no 
Internet connection and you know,

3347
02:30:59,060 --> 02:31:04,060
that's completely different than 
anything we would have ever done if we 

3348
02:31:04,060 --> 02:31:04,060
just said,
all right,

3349
02:31:04,060 --> 02:31:04,060
let's go hunting.
What do you want?

3350
02:31:04,060 --> 02:31:04,640
We would have probably going to hire 
somebody.

3351
02:31:04,990 --> 02:31:09,990
Yeah.
If we both caught it was time to go 

3352
02:31:09,990 --> 02:31:09,990
home.
Dude,

3353
02:31:09,990 --> 02:31:10,130
this sucks.
Let's go eat.

3354
02:31:10,131 --> 02:31:12,770
Let's go get some steaks.
So glad we did and I'm so glad.

3355
02:31:12,800 --> 02:31:14,420
Looking back on it.
Ms Dot took five days.

3356
02:31:14,450 --> 02:31:19,450
The first day we get there pouring rain 
and I knew it was fucking for real when 

3357
02:31:19,450 --> 02:31:19,980
we stopped at

3358
02:31:19,980 --> 02:31:24,980
the,
with one of the spots where Lewis and 

3359
02:31:24,980 --> 02:31:24,980
Clark camped,
you know that,

3360
02:31:24,990 --> 02:31:29,990
you know,
if you have any sense of history at all 

3361
02:31:29,990 --> 02:31:32,841
and you sort of trying to take this in,
like how bizarre it really is at several

3362
02:31:33,510 --> 02:31:37,110
hundred years ago before the invention 
of radio and the camera,

3363
02:31:37,290 --> 02:31:41,700
there were some fucking people that were
traveling across the entire river.

3364
02:31:41,910 --> 02:31:46,910
They were going down the Missouri River.
They were traveling across the whole 

3365
02:31:46,910 --> 02:31:48,690
country and they were right there 
camping where you're going to camp

3366
02:31:48,850 --> 02:31:53,850
and it's still like there's some notable
things that are different but it still 

3367
02:31:53,850 --> 02:31:56,260
is kind of like very reminiscent of it.
And there's a friend who does a writer.

3368
02:31:56,261 --> 02:31:57,700
I've always admired a lot that the 
writer,

3369
02:31:57,701 --> 02:32:02,080
Ian Frazier and he's written a lot about
the American west and,

3370
02:32:02,450 --> 02:32:05,190
and we were on that river one time and 
he was just saying like,

3371
02:32:05,230 --> 02:32:07,600
he just likes it,
that it happened.

3372
02:32:08,110 --> 02:32:13,110
You know,
like Lewis and Clark came here and 

3373
02:32:13,110 --> 02:32:13,110
camped here.
And he's like.

3374
02:32:13,110 --> 02:32:15,190
And then nothing ever really happened 
over again.

3375
02:32:15,730 --> 02:32:17,440
You know,
when I think about that,

3376
02:32:17,460 --> 02:32:20,230
I'll point out you can go to site so you
can go to places.

3377
02:32:20,480 --> 02:32:23,380
I was at.
I was one time I was 20 because I was on

3378
02:32:23,381 --> 02:32:25,120
the phone with innovation one time 
they'll sell them.

3379
02:32:25,121 --> 02:32:25,840
He said,
where are you?

3380
02:32:25,841 --> 02:32:30,841
And I was in New York,
we were trying to meet up and I 

3381
02:32:30,841 --> 02:32:30,841
explained to him that I was out in front
of this bar,

3382
02:32:30,841 --> 02:32:31,510
like the white horse or something.

3383
02:32:31,510 --> 02:32:32,020
And he's like,
you know,

3384
02:32:32,021 --> 02:32:34,330
Dylan Thomas Drank himself to death and 
died,

3385
02:32:34,331 --> 02:32:34,980
right?
He like,

3386
02:32:34,990 --> 02:32:35,860
what corner you want?
I said,

3387
02:32:35,861 --> 02:32:38,200
well I'm at this and such in that booth.
And he's like,

3388
02:32:38,201 --> 02:32:38,560
he's like,
yeah,

3389
02:32:38,561 --> 02:32:40,840
Dylan Thomas collapse like drain stuff.
The debt there.

3390
02:32:41,660 --> 02:32:44,470
And I was wondering anyway,
it's like,

3391
02:32:44,471 --> 02:32:45,190
wow,
that's amazing.

3392
02:32:45,430 --> 02:32:47,740
But then you think like all the other 
stuff that happened,

3393
02:32:48,150 --> 02:32:49,740
you know,
people get hit by cars and like,

3394
02:32:50,250 --> 02:32:55,250
you know,
people getting broken up with and 

3395
02:32:55,250 --> 02:32:57,420
falling in love and like all these 
layers upon layers of other activities 

3396
02:32:57,420 --> 02:32:58,570
that went on there in some way dilutes 
it,

3397
02:32:59,200 --> 02:33:00,850
you know,
it becomes hard to picture.

3398
02:33:00,851 --> 02:33:03,450
But the Camper Lewis and Clark camped 
and look at ego like,

3399
02:33:03,460 --> 02:33:04,000
no,
I get it,

3400
02:33:04,001 --> 02:33:06,070
man.
It's not abstract for me.

3401
02:33:09,230 --> 02:33:14,230
Even though we had stoves and stuff,
you're still kind of living and feeling 

3402
02:33:14,820 --> 02:33:19,820
what he,
they were feeling to hold the bolt in 

3403
02:33:19,820 --> 02:33:19,820
the morning.
Dark Brian Callahan just texted me,

3404
02:33:19,820 --> 02:33:23,840
heard us talking about him.
Didn't get a chance to listen to 

3405
02:33:23,840 --> 02:33:24,600
podcasts yet.
I'm sure it was great.

3406
02:33:25,040 --> 02:33:26,320
That's good man.
Yeah,

3407
02:33:26,321 --> 02:33:27,480
that's funny.
So,

3408
02:33:27,481 --> 02:33:30,120
um,
but that was getting the boat.

3409
02:33:30,270 --> 02:33:31,950
Make some,
cover some ground on the boat,

3410
02:33:31,990 --> 02:33:34,020
get out pitch camp.
Trying to secure.

3411
02:33:34,021 --> 02:33:35,130
Meet through hunting.
Yeah.

3412
02:33:35,250 --> 02:33:37,770
Get back in the boat pitch camp,
you know?

3413
02:33:38,250 --> 02:33:39,330
Yeah.
All in all we went,

3414
02:33:39,331 --> 02:33:41,750
what was it?
Forty something miles down the river was

3415
02:33:42,150 --> 02:33:44,000
38 or no more than.
Well,

3416
02:33:44,030 --> 02:33:45,380
he went a long way because I remember 
that,

3417
02:33:45,381 --> 02:33:49,980
that that trip back me and tell it back.
I was so cold and damp.

3418
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:51,180
Dirty was really cool.
I go,

3419
02:33:51,181 --> 02:33:52,590
what's wrong with me?
Because I'm really cool.

3420
02:33:52,591 --> 02:33:57,591
I'd pull the sleeping bag out of my and 
we just wrapped up because it was like 

3421
02:33:57,591 --> 02:34:00,291
12 degrees.
I was watching that I that it was so 

3422
02:34:00,291 --> 02:34:04,191
cold,
like it was 12 degrees and I was such a 

3423
02:34:04,191 --> 02:34:04,191
baby.
I'm like,

3424
02:34:04,191 --> 02:34:04,191
you know what?
I got lucky.

3425
02:34:04,191 --> 02:34:08,631
I was with him and he told me American 
Indian stories the whole way and you 

3426
02:34:08,631 --> 02:34:09,150
didn't even didn't even bother me,
man.

3427
02:34:09,180 --> 02:34:14,180
I'm telling you eight hours of American 
Indian stories or whatever the fuck it 

3428
02:34:14,180 --> 02:34:17,661
was different than cold.
It's like the minute something

3429
02:34:18,060 --> 02:34:23,060
wet water,
like you get like a little bit of 

3430
02:34:23,060 --> 02:34:23,530
moisture in your gloves just becomes a 
different game.

3431
02:34:23,531 --> 02:34:28,531
I was watching those guys play football 
and the playoffs in Denver and it was 

3432
02:34:28,531 --> 02:34:32,071
minus three with the windchill factor 
and we were playing football in short 

3433
02:34:32,071 --> 02:34:35,161
sleeves and Ray Lewis Ray though was 
just sitting there and short sleeves 

3434
02:34:35,161 --> 02:34:35,610
even on the bench.
He's just sitting there like this.

3435
02:34:35,670 --> 02:34:38,170
I'm just thinking of himself.
I liked it.

3436
02:34:38,180 --> 02:34:41,240
You got no sleeves on.
It's minus three with the windchill.

3437
02:34:41,400 --> 02:34:43,210
Yes.
What was the actual temperature?

3438
02:34:43,270 --> 02:34:45,070
It was nine degrees,
so it was cold,

3439
02:34:45,120 --> 02:34:45,990
cold,
cold,

3440
02:34:45,991 --> 02:34:50,991
cold,
cold minus three with the window and 

3441
02:34:50,991 --> 02:34:51,670
these guys were hitting each other,
hitting each other.

3442
02:34:51,700 --> 02:34:53,360
That ball's got sting your hands at that
time.

3443
02:34:53,420 --> 02:34:54,640
I think they have gloves on.
Was on

3444
02:34:57,840 --> 02:35:00,680
the river is so fucking shallow in some 
spots.

3445
02:35:00,681 --> 02:35:05,681
That's the one thing that was really 
surprising is that we went bought them 

3446
02:35:05,681 --> 02:35:06,530
out.
This is a really fragile ecosystem.

3447
02:35:06,531 --> 02:35:08,130
That's one thing that's probably a lot 
difference.

3448
02:35:08,150 --> 02:35:11,710
Of course that rivers heavily damn now.
So we're in that area.

3449
02:35:11,810 --> 02:35:14,510
You got dams above you and you got dance
below you.

3450
02:35:14,780 --> 02:35:19,780
So.
But I mean you spill a run it with 

3451
02:35:19,780 --> 02:35:22,160
riverboats like paddle wheel boats,
but it was,

3452
02:35:22,210 --> 02:35:25,370
it was a confusion of channels so it 
took a lot of skill to be able navigate,

3453
02:35:25,371 --> 02:35:30,371
but there was a continuous navigable 
channel and when you damn those rivers 

3454
02:35:30,561 --> 02:35:34,490
now you get a lot of sedimentation.
So the river would,

3455
02:35:34,491 --> 02:35:37,090
at times gets scoured out,
you get a mat,

3456
02:35:37,150 --> 02:35:42,150
you get a big flood in the spring,
snow is coming out of the mountains 

3457
02:35:42,150 --> 02:35:45,911
coming out of the yellowstone area,
so it would come down here and just 

3458
02:35:45,911 --> 02:35:46,970
gouges that area and carry all that 
sediment away.

3459
02:35:47,270 --> 02:35:49,880
But the dams do flood control,
flood control,

3460
02:35:49,881 --> 02:35:51,980
and they form another function,
erosion control.

3461
02:35:52,220 --> 02:35:56,930
So you get built up over time,
just mud silt in the river.

3462
02:35:56,931 --> 02:35:58,250
And so the river is a lot different 
than,

3463
02:35:58,310 --> 02:36:02,030
than it used to be in the river as much 
as some of the surrounding topography is

3464
02:36:02,660 --> 02:36:05,750
very similar in some ways.
Some regards untouched.

3465
02:36:06,680 --> 02:36:10,280
That river is now a creation of damming.
Oh Wow.

3466
02:36:10,330 --> 02:36:12,710
Yeah.
And the river goes to the ocean.

3467
02:36:13,100 --> 02:36:16,610
That river heads when Lewis and Clark 
were talking about earlier,

3468
02:36:16,670 --> 02:36:18,020
Lewis Clark.
So Lewis and Clark,

3469
02:36:18,380 --> 02:36:20,120
when they got dispatched on that,
uh,

3470
02:36:20,150 --> 02:36:23,780
on their trip and they went up,
I remember they left in 18.

3471
02:36:23,781 --> 02:36:24,070
Oh,
two,

3472
02:36:24,080 --> 02:36:24,600
eight,
you know,

3473
02:36:24,650 --> 02:36:27,770
for her to original for four,
they went up in one of the things.

3474
02:36:27,840 --> 02:36:30,050
They had many tasks that they were 
supposed to do.

3475
02:36:30,051 --> 02:36:35,051
But one of the primary tasks Jefferson 
gave him was to find the headwaters of 

3476
02:36:35,051 --> 02:36:36,590
the Missouri so people knew,
you know,

3477
02:36:36,710 --> 02:36:38,690
the knew the Missouri was a major 
artery,

3478
02:36:38,930 --> 02:36:41,810
but where did the Missouri begin and 
wherever it began,

3479
02:36:41,811 --> 02:36:44,750
was there a viable way to go up and over
out to the Pacific.

3480
02:36:45,800 --> 02:36:50,800
When they went up,
they found the headwaters of Montana or 

3481
02:36:50,800 --> 02:36:54,011
the Missouri,
just upstream from where we were in the 

3482
02:36:54,011 --> 02:36:54,140
headwaters they discovered were three 
years.

3483
02:36:54,141 --> 02:36:59,141
They named the name of the Jefferson,
the Gallatin and the Madison.

3484
02:37:00,080 --> 02:37:02,280
So it was a secretary of state,
secretary of Treasury,

3485
02:37:02,281 --> 02:37:03,470
and the President I think is what it 
was.

3486
02:37:03,471 --> 02:37:05,810
The name three rivers.
And that's what heads that river.

3487
02:37:06,320 --> 02:37:11,320
So those rivers had won like the 
yellowstone heads up yellowstone lake 

3488
02:37:11,320 --> 02:37:11,540
also national park,
I'm sorry,

3489
02:37:11,541 --> 02:37:16,541
the alternate goals another way.
But the Missouri and Jeff had Montana 

3490
02:37:16,541 --> 02:37:21,210
and in a goal in flow all the way out to
the Gulf of Mexico,

3491
02:37:22,610 --> 02:37:25,730
people now argue,
we were so familiar with the Mississippi

3492
02:37:26,270 --> 02:37:27,270
that we,
the Mississippi,

3493
02:37:27,271 --> 02:37:32,271
his name.
We didn't know that much about the 

3494
02:37:32,271 --> 02:37:33,641
Missouri because you know,
people have been dinking around 

3495
02:37:33,641 --> 02:37:33,641
Mississippi long before the Europeans 
have been messing around the Mississippi

3496
02:37:33,641 --> 02:37:37,961
long for the Missouri hydrologists later
and geologists later argued that the 

3497
02:37:37,961 --> 02:37:42,731
Mississippi wasn't,
wasn't named properly that by any 

3498
02:37:42,731 --> 02:37:46,031
estimation it would be that the Missouri
picked up the Mississippi and not vice 

3499
02:37:46,031 --> 02:37:50,591
versa.
There were those two rivers came 

3500
02:37:50,591 --> 02:37:52,691
together.
Like the Missouri is a true continental 

3501
02:37:52,691 --> 02:37:54,911
river.
It's draining all the way from the 

3502
02:37:54,911 --> 02:37:56,960
mountains of Montana out to the Gulf of 
Mexico and the Mississippi heads like up

3503
02:37:56,961 --> 02:37:58,670
in Minnesota,
you know,

3504
02:37:59,120 --> 02:38:01,460
so they argued that that's actually what
went on.

3505
02:38:01,670 --> 02:38:04,790
So the Mississippi by is now the 
Mississippi by name,

3506
02:38:04,850 --> 02:38:09,850
but in like a physical sense where 
you're looking the Mississippi and the 

3507
02:38:09,850 --> 02:38:09,850
Missouri,

3508
02:38:09,850 --> 02:38:13,470
I think the riverboat gambling is one of
the craziest ideas ever that they would 

3509
02:38:13,470 --> 02:38:17,131
allow you to gamble if you've gotten 
something floating and then the state 

3510
02:38:17,131 --> 02:38:17,630
lines.
All right.

3511
02:38:17,830 --> 02:38:21,060
Isn't it ridiculous?
It's got to be in between state lines.

3512
02:38:21,590 --> 02:38:26,590
Yeah.
It's a gray area because they like a no 

3513
02:38:26,590 --> 02:38:28,900
man's land because it's bordered by,
you know,

3514
02:38:29,010 --> 02:38:29,330
it's like,
yeah.

3515
02:38:29,360 --> 02:38:32,950
Once they don't,
one side was that I think that we should

3516
02:38:32,951 --> 02:38:35,640
have a gray area between all states or 
you get.

3517
02:38:35,780 --> 02:38:37,940
You could do anything you want.
You just.

3518
02:38:38,320 --> 02:38:40,300
You can eat mushrooms,
you can get a hooker,

3519
02:38:40,330 --> 02:38:43,600
you can do whatever you want.
Anything shy of murder and robbery.

3520
02:38:43,960 --> 02:38:48,960
Just a wild west grey area where there's
very few laws that everybody knows.

3521
02:38:49,870 --> 02:38:50,950
Everybody knows where it is.

3522
02:38:50,980 --> 02:38:55,980
Crossed the Mississippi.
Why does that get to be the lawless 

3523
02:38:55,980 --> 02:38:55,980
zone?
Like the Great Lakes?

3524
02:38:55,980 --> 02:38:59,791
She can't even see it.
She can be a massive area of utter 

3525
02:38:59,791 --> 02:39:03,301
lawlessness,
but there's no like you can't go out 

3526
02:39:03,301 --> 02:39:03,301
there and do crazy stuff that you can't 
do on the bank.

3527
02:39:03,301 --> 02:39:07,170
Yeah,
but I'm saying a little gray area still.

3528
02:39:07,250 --> 02:39:10,830
You could have a whole resort out in the
boats on land,

3529
02:39:11,220 --> 02:39:13,630
on land.
Anywhere where there's a border,

3530
02:39:13,720 --> 02:39:18,110
it's fucking who knows whatever to 
towns.

3531
02:39:18,540 --> 02:39:18,850
Well,
you know,

3532
02:39:18,890 --> 02:39:19,370
the,
the,

3533
02:39:19,490 --> 02:39:24,490
the idea is being bandied about by some 
really rich investors that they want to 

3534
02:39:24,490 --> 02:39:28,501
build an artificial city that floats and
they want to put it and put it out in 

3535
02:39:28,501 --> 02:39:31,140
international waters and the idea that 
the international space station,

3536
02:39:31,141 --> 02:39:36,141
but something like that,
that they would be able to do this and 

3537
02:39:36,141 --> 02:39:36,141
make their own,
like the Utopian society.

3538
02:39:36,141 --> 02:39:38,350
They're like tired of this nonsense.
He's libertarian ideals.

3539
02:39:38,351 --> 02:39:42,850
Everybody wants everybody who joins this
venture to be able to support themselves

3540
02:39:42,851 --> 02:39:47,851
and you know,
to decide as a community that we could 

3541
02:39:47,851 --> 02:39:47,851
all work this out,
going to make a drink,

3542
02:39:47,851 --> 02:39:48,140
ganache,
Anglin,

3543
02:39:48,141 --> 02:39:52,840
and push that pitch out into the ocean.
But good luck not getting robbed.

3544
02:39:53,130 --> 02:39:58,130
There's a couple of good luck.
Exactly.

3545
02:39:58,500 --> 02:39:59,530
Yeah,
exactly.

3546
02:39:59,770 --> 02:40:01,790
That.
Don't do it in the Indian Ocean to adult

3547
02:40:01,830 --> 02:40:05,450
tooth fucking kidnapped all the time.
That's why it's like,

3548
02:40:05,451 --> 02:40:10,451
oh,
we went sailing and Caribbean had 

3549
02:40:10,451 --> 02:40:10,451
notion.
Listen Dude,

3550
02:40:10,451 --> 02:40:13,470
people get people get robbed,
killed and raped and thrown all

3551
02:40:14,040 --> 02:40:15,240
the time.
Not Me,

3552
02:40:15,250 --> 02:40:20,250
man.
If I have a couple of navy vessels full 

3553
02:40:20,250 --> 02:40:22,140
of navy seals following me around,
otherwise I don't understand people that

3554
02:40:22,141 --> 02:40:27,141
sort of trusting,
like we went there and made their 

3555
02:40:27,141 --> 02:40:27,141
parents lived in the Bahamas on a 
sailboat.

3556
02:40:27,141 --> 02:40:28,980
I lived there for awhile.
The uh,

3557
02:40:28,981 --> 02:40:32,520
they took a sailboat from Florida all 
the way down to the Bahamas and lived in

3558
02:40:32,521 --> 02:40:34,890
various spots on the sailboat and I was 
like,

3559
02:40:34,891 --> 02:40:38,870
you guys are fucking after you were gone
before you around.

3560
02:40:39,040 --> 02:40:44,040
I was in the middle of the ocean with no
backup and some pirates come up.

3561
02:40:44,810 --> 02:40:45,840
Happens all the time.
Oh,

3562
02:40:45,860 --> 02:40:47,070
definitely can happen.
I mean,

3563
02:40:47,071 --> 02:40:47,360
the,
I,

3564
02:40:47,470 --> 02:40:50,370
the odds are pretty small if you look at
how many ships are out there,

3565
02:40:50,371 --> 02:40:53,730
but if it happens,
you're fucked and it could happen.

3566
02:40:53,731 --> 02:40:58,731
I mean,
rich couple get kidnapped really 

3567
02:40:58,731 --> 02:40:58,740
recently happens all the time.
There's always some new stories

3568
02:40:59,200 --> 02:41:00,520
like up.
Because I grew up,

3569
02:41:00,600 --> 02:41:02,290
you know,
in a landlocked state man.

3570
02:41:02,291 --> 02:41:03,700
Like for me,
for my,

3571
02:41:03,730 --> 02:41:06,210
like you guys might have had that 
feeling of uh,

3572
02:41:06,650 --> 02:41:08,410
being in the break she had that feeling 
of kind of like,

3573
02:41:09,070 --> 02:41:14,070
not overwhelmed but like,
like humbled by the landscape some way 

3574
02:41:14,070 --> 02:41:16,390
for me.
Like I'm so new to maritime stuff for me

3575
02:41:16,391 --> 02:41:21,391
to be out on the ocean.
Like I didn't grow up like looking out 

3576
02:41:21,391 --> 02:41:21,391
at ocean,
you know what I mean?

3577
02:41:21,391 --> 02:41:24,460
And for like for me now when I'm on an 
ocean and I'm always like,

3578
02:41:24,850 --> 02:41:27,030
this is serious business man,
you know,

3579
02:41:27,100 --> 02:41:30,040
I mean I get that feeling of just like,
holy cow.

3580
02:41:30,140 --> 02:41:32,440
It's unbelievable when you get out where
you can't see land.

3581
02:41:32,441 --> 02:41:34,020
To me,
that's when I started getting that.

3582
02:41:34,030 --> 02:41:37,300
Like a very nice uncomfortable feeling.
My buddy,

3583
02:41:37,301 --> 02:41:40,390
my buddy used to for a living,
he used to take rich guys.

3584
02:41:40,391 --> 02:41:44,740
They buy a sailboat and then you'd have 
to sell it to them wherever they were,

3585
02:41:45,460 --> 02:41:49,480
but promise in that when you do a winter
run along the Atlantic,

3586
02:41:49,510 --> 02:41:52,570
that storm season.
So very few people want to actually take

3587
02:41:52,571 --> 02:41:57,571
the sailboat when you buy in the winter 
and bring it to you because they're 

3588
02:41:57,571 --> 02:41:57,571
going to get caught in storms.
My buddy did that,

3589
02:41:57,571 --> 02:42:02,490
my buddies and he take a 32 foot yacht 
and he got caught in a storm out off of 

3590
02:42:04,150 --> 02:42:05,560
San Francisco in the winter,

3591
02:42:05,930 --> 02:42:08,900
well at night and he had strapped 
himself in and he was trying.

3592
02:42:08,930 --> 02:42:13,930
He was trying to turn the boat because 
he was gotten 20 foot swells that were 

3593
02:42:13,930 --> 02:42:18,191
submerging the boat so he would get 
submerged under the ocean and then pop 

3594
02:42:18,390 --> 02:42:23,390
out for 14 hours and and now I didn't do
it 14 hours alone,

3595
02:42:24,951 --> 02:42:29,951
but he,
he had his crew under under ground 

3596
02:42:29,951 --> 02:42:30,920
because he was the cab for 14 hours.
He did that and they,

3597
02:42:30,921 --> 02:42:33,080
they,
he radioed for a guy to get him,

3598
02:42:33,320 --> 02:42:35,960
but the guy wasn't experienced enough.
So then they had the radio.

3599
02:42:35,961 --> 02:42:40,961
A guy who had,
who did it a lot in Alaska to tow them 

3600
02:42:40,961 --> 02:42:42,020
back in and they finally get that guy on
the phone.

3601
02:42:42,021 --> 02:42:44,150
I guess he flies in,
he gets in his boat now.

3602
02:42:44,270 --> 02:42:47,660
He goes out,
hooks onto them and told them to safety.

3603
02:42:47,840 --> 02:42:49,550
Fourteen hours at night.
I said,

3604
02:42:49,551 --> 02:42:51,150
how'd you know to look?
He goes,

3605
02:42:51,151 --> 02:42:52,340
you,
I would have to here.

3606
02:42:52,341 --> 02:42:57,341
I'd have to listen for when the swell 
was gonna hit me because I couldn't see 

3607
02:42:57,341 --> 02:42:57,341
it,
so I'd have to listen.

3608
02:42:57,700 --> 02:43:02,700
I hear just and I go and,
and you and I said,

3609
02:43:04,191 --> 02:43:04,670
well,
you call it.

3610
02:43:04,671 --> 02:43:06,050
He goes,
fuck yeah.

3611
02:43:06,051 --> 02:43:07,520
He was in a wetsuit.
He goes,

3612
02:43:07,580 --> 02:43:09,050
fuck yeah,
you're cold.

3613
02:43:09,200 --> 02:43:10,580
You're really cold,
man.

3614
02:43:10,581 --> 02:43:12,040
You're facing hands.
Feel like they're going to

3615
02:43:12,040 --> 02:43:15,310
fall off growing up near the ocean.
You get,

3616
02:43:15,340 --> 02:43:17,260
you get to use to it.
You get,

3617
02:43:17,500 --> 02:43:22,500
you know,
you don't really take it into 

3618
02:43:22,500 --> 02:43:22,500
consideration of how crazy it is.
But I had a friend from Oklahoma,

3619
02:43:22,500 --> 02:43:25,930
I never saw the ocean before and we were
in Texas and he went to the ocean and he

3620
02:43:25,931 --> 02:43:30,931
was like,
he had just gotten back from the moon 

3621
02:43:30,931 --> 02:43:33,190
who might as well plant wears a life 
jacket.

3622
02:43:33,191 --> 02:43:33,730
He goes,
well,

3623
02:43:33,731 --> 02:43:35,190
they're two different schools.
What do you mean?

3624
02:43:35,200 --> 02:43:36,290
He goes,
somebody had done something.

3625
02:43:36,310 --> 02:43:37,570
I said,
why?

3626
02:43:37,571 --> 02:43:38,710
He goes,
well,

3627
02:43:38,711 --> 02:43:41,260
I believe that if you get washed 
overboard,

3628
02:43:41,261 --> 02:43:42,910
you're probably be injured to begin 
with.

3629
02:43:42,940 --> 02:43:47,940
It's much better just to drown,
really to sit there and die of 

3630
02:43:47,940 --> 02:43:49,030
hypothermia for 16 hours later.
He said,

3631
02:43:49,150 --> 02:43:50,470
or sharks come get you.
He said,

3632
02:43:50,740 --> 02:43:52,660
they can be right on top of you.
They're not going to find you.

3633
02:43:52,660 --> 02:43:54,070
A lot of times.
My friend who,

3634
02:43:54,071 --> 02:43:56,350
uh,
went to my friend who went to the ocean,

3635
02:43:56,410 --> 02:43:58,840
he had a ticket cigarette before he 
described it,

3636
02:43:59,690 --> 02:44:00,770
like you sat down.
He goes,

3637
02:44:00,780 --> 02:44:02,920
man,
lit his cigarette,

3638
02:44:03,640 --> 02:44:08,640
took a big brother who was worried about
began man descriptive power him because 

3639
02:44:08,891 --> 02:44:13,891
he was in his thirties to him in his 
thirties to just see the ocean for the 

3640
02:44:13,891 --> 02:44:17,311
first time.
He really doesn't leave Oklahoma lunch 

3641
02:44:17,311 --> 02:44:18,280
and all of a sudden these in Houston 
made a trip down to the,

3642
02:44:18,310 --> 02:44:20,170
to the ocean.
He's standing out there watching it.

3643
02:44:20,610 --> 02:44:21,540
It's like,
well,

3644
02:44:21,620 --> 02:44:24,640
it's Kinda really fucked saying 
something out of turn.

3645
02:44:24,641 --> 02:44:26,800
But David Blaine,
his his trick,

3646
02:44:26,801 --> 02:44:31,801
he wanted to cross the Pacific in a 
bottle and so the problem with it and he

3647
02:44:32,200 --> 02:44:34,140
went out on a Catamaran in a really 
fixed,

3648
02:44:34,141 --> 02:44:36,220
warm and people were like at bandied 
about bleeding,

3649
02:44:36,221 --> 02:44:37,250
knocked out,
and he,

3650
02:44:37,251 --> 02:44:38,410
he's like,
I'm good with any of that.

3651
02:44:38,411 --> 02:44:43,411
He doesn't get any.
Then he got in the water with great 

3652
02:44:43,411 --> 02:44:43,411
whites.
He's got video of him.

3653
02:44:43,411 --> 02:44:43,411
Swimming was great.
I don't,

3654
02:44:43,411 --> 02:44:43,600
I don't want to tell too much.
I hope he doesn't,

3655
02:44:43,680 --> 02:44:44,620
you know.
But anyway,

3656
02:44:44,621 --> 02:44:47,790
the point is that the guy said,
I'm a Sam Sharon,

3657
02:44:47,840 --> 02:44:48,400
who,
who,

3658
02:44:48,401 --> 02:44:48,910
uh,
who,

3659
02:44:49,180 --> 02:44:50,260
by the way,
his book is Great.

3660
02:44:50,390 --> 02:44:51,790
He goes,
dude,

3661
02:44:51,791 --> 02:44:56,020
if you get caught in a bottle and you,
if you were in a bottle in the Pacific,

3662
02:44:56,260 --> 02:45:00,190
you can get caught in a storm for 72 
hours because he's crossed.

3663
02:45:02,690 --> 02:45:06,160
Be tossed around in that,
in that bottle for 72 hours.

3664
02:45:06,280 --> 02:45:11,280
That's a shitty way to job.
That's a shitty way to die because 

3665
02:45:11,280 --> 02:45:12,460
you're not going to be able to keep up 
with the roles for 72 hours.

3666
02:45:12,461 --> 02:45:13,960
You're eventually gonna get dropped on 
your head.

3667
02:45:14,130 --> 02:45:19,130
You're not out for a second and you're 
going to get elevated and dropped any 

3668
02:45:19,130 --> 02:45:22,530
fucking head and you're going to hit 
that thick glass wall and it's going to 

3669
02:45:22,530 --> 02:45:24,910
cave your stupid face,
and I've got a friend that I wrote about

3670
02:45:24,911 --> 02:45:28,240
in my first book who grew up in San 
Diego and he,

3671
02:45:28,270 --> 02:45:32,350
one of his first jobs,
he worked on a tuna boat and went out in

3672
02:45:32,351 --> 02:45:36,210
the tuneable,
sank in one of the guys use withdrawal,

3673
02:45:36,220 --> 02:45:37,630
and he stayed.
He stayed on the hatch,

3674
02:45:37,650 --> 02:45:42,650
covered with a guy.
He was murdered with drone and he 

3675
02:45:42,650 --> 02:45:44,970
managed to keep this guy's body with the
judge.

3676
02:45:45,320 --> 02:45:50,320
They're pulled out and he was just done 
with.

3677
02:45:50,830 --> 02:45:52,660
He went to,
he went to vet school,

3678
02:45:53,650 --> 02:45:58,650
didn't go back out on the ocean anymore 
and change his birth date to the day 

3679
02:45:58,650 --> 02:45:59,890
changes birthday to the day that he,
uh,

3680
02:46:00,610 --> 02:46:05,610
got plucked out and celebrates that is 
his birthday every year.

3681
02:46:05,831 --> 02:46:09,210
He has a big party on the day you got 
out of the ocean liar.

3682
02:46:09,510 --> 02:46:10,440
He's a veterinarian

3683
02:46:10,440 --> 02:46:14,340
up in St and he's a veterinarian up in 
St Helena in the Napa Valley now.

3684
02:46:14,341 --> 02:46:15,840
He's just like,
I'm done with the water man.

3685
02:46:16,050 --> 02:46:17,520
Wow.
Good for him.

3686
02:46:17,521 --> 02:46:19,020
Fuck the ocean.
Ocean.

3687
02:46:19,350 --> 02:46:21,030
The ocean can suck it.
The ocean.

3688
02:46:21,030 --> 02:46:24,340
It's fucking terrifying meant.
But um,

3689
02:46:24,780 --> 02:46:25,900
that's hilarious.
Yeah.

3690
02:46:26,460 --> 02:46:27,060
But Atlanta,
man,

3691
02:46:27,120 --> 02:46:28,890
thanks again man.
Thanks for taking us there.

3692
02:46:28,920 --> 02:46:30,720
We had the fucking time of our lives.

3693
02:46:31,220 --> 02:46:36,220
It was good man.
I look forward to get you guys back out 

3694
02:46:36,220 --> 02:46:36,690
and that a sweet looking rack.
Yeah.

3695
02:46:36,691 --> 02:46:37,700
It's awesome to see,
you know,

3696
02:46:37,701 --> 02:46:39,450
what people are down because they want 
last thing.

3697
02:46:39,510 --> 02:46:40,200
Yeah,
please.

3698
02:46:41,010 --> 02:46:42,990
Issue hunting trophies always comes up,
you know,

3699
02:46:43,140 --> 02:46:48,140
and um,
and I decorate my home with schools and 

3700
02:46:48,140 --> 02:46:48,140
the antlers and horns and stuff like 
that.

3701
02:46:48,140 --> 02:46:48,140
And,
and uh,

3702
02:46:48,260 --> 02:46:51,160
and people are down on trophy hunting.
I think that experience like that.

3703
02:46:51,161 --> 02:46:53,430
Like you went out,
you had a legit haunt,

3704
02:46:53,640 --> 02:46:58,640
you ate all the meat.
It's like now like that thing becomes 

3705
02:46:58,640 --> 02:46:59,040
like an emblem of lot more and it's 
like,

3706
02:46:59,180 --> 02:47:01,660
I think trophies are cool.
I think that having that,

3707
02:47:01,680 --> 02:47:06,680
it's like one word for be a trophy in 
that where it'd be like a memento or a 

3708
02:47:06,680 --> 02:47:06,680
talisman.
I don't know.

3709
02:47:06,680 --> 02:47:10,140
It's just like you'll always look at and
remember that a lot of cactus quilts for

3710
02:47:10,141 --> 02:47:13,080
that whole set of experiences,
you know,

3711
02:47:13,081 --> 02:47:14,820
it's not some shadow thing like,
oh,

3712
02:47:14,821 --> 02:47:17,700
I'm such a man that I'm not going to 
pose his head up.

3713
02:47:18,260 --> 02:47:18,550
No,

3714
02:47:18,580 --> 02:47:20,380
I don't.
I didn't think of it that way at all.

3715
02:47:20,440 --> 02:47:22,870
You know,
there's so much controversy attached.

3716
02:47:22,871 --> 02:47:25,180
I don't have to tell you this too,
the hunting experience.

3717
02:47:25,450 --> 02:47:30,450
So the idea of killing your own food.
There's so much craziness on both sides.

3718
02:47:30,820 --> 02:47:31,330
You know,
the,

3719
02:47:31,420 --> 02:47:32,500
the,
the people that are,

3720
02:47:32,580 --> 02:47:34,480
uh,
anti-hunting or the people that even,

3721
02:47:34,490 --> 02:47:37,660
that eat meat and wear leather and are 
still anti hunting.

3722
02:47:37,690 --> 02:47:42,690
It's,
it's shocking how many of those people 

3723
02:47:42,690 --> 02:47:44,060
that it's such a weird thing.
I can completely understand your,

3724
02:47:44,290 --> 02:47:49,290
your wife's point of view.
Not wanting to go and do the killing 

3725
02:47:49,290 --> 02:47:52,741
yourself,
but the idea that there's something 

3726
02:47:52,741 --> 02:47:55,741
wrong with the people who do it.
One of the things that I saw about this 

3727
02:47:55,741 --> 02:47:57,490
new town Connecticut thing,
one of the tweets that I read,

3728
02:47:57,491 --> 02:48:02,491
I read a lot of crazy tweets,
but one of them I read with this guy 

3729
02:48:02,491 --> 02:48:02,491
said,
if you're a hunter,

3730
02:48:02,491 --> 02:48:02,890
tough shit,
get a new hobby,

3731
02:48:02,891 --> 02:48:04,410
no guns,
and it was like tags,

3732
02:48:04,610 --> 02:48:07,180
like Hashtag no guns,
and I was like,

3733
02:48:07,181 --> 02:48:08,920
what kind of fucking.

3734
02:48:09,310 --> 02:48:13,960
What kind of crazy nonsense is that 
hunter get a new hobby.

3735
02:48:13,961 --> 02:48:18,280
The idea that these people are willing 
to get because of crazy people,

3736
02:48:18,281 --> 02:48:21,940
whatever.
Many to get all rights to own firearms,

3737
02:48:21,941 --> 02:48:25,150
stripped away to the point where you 
can't hunt anymore,

3738
02:48:25,420 --> 02:48:30,420
and the idea that someone would just 
propose that Tim Ferriss had problem 

3739
02:48:30,420 --> 02:48:34,231
with voting.
The problem voting is fat guy gets to 

3740
02:48:34,231 --> 02:48:36,760
vote to well Tim Ferriss,
Kosta cortical by somebody.

3741
02:48:36,761 --> 02:48:39,520
I can't remember who it was and I read 
it and it was about said guns.

3742
02:48:39,521 --> 02:48:43,210
Actually I have a lot to do with why 
there isn't a lot of violence.

3743
02:48:43,260 --> 02:48:48,260
They neutralized violence in some ways.
It's sometimes in the sense that if you 

3744
02:48:48,260 --> 02:48:51,901
don't have guns,
you the guy with the biggest knife in 

3745
02:48:51,901 --> 02:48:51,901
the strongest guy going to do what he 
wants and guns are,

3746
02:48:51,901 --> 02:48:56,671
are,
have always been sort of in a society 

3747
02:48:56,671 --> 02:48:56,671
they keep.

3748
02:48:56,671 --> 02:49:00,060
They keep the strongest guy with a knife
from raping somebody in front of 12 

3749
02:49:00,060 --> 02:49:03,001
people.
Someone's going to shoot that fucking 

3750
02:49:03,001 --> 02:49:03,001
guy.
Yeah.

3751
02:49:03,001 --> 02:49:05,250
I mean,
you can't have society in this form 

3752
02:49:05,250 --> 02:49:07,531
without some form of weaponry.
You have to be able to protect people 

3753
02:49:07,531 --> 02:49:09,270
against aggressive people from somewhere
else.

3754
02:49:09,330 --> 02:49:14,330
Right.
Whether it's a local thread or a thread 

3755
02:49:14,330 --> 02:49:15,240
on a boat from another country like 
Columbus and his boys.

3756
02:49:15,241 --> 02:49:16,600
Yeah.
I mean that's just.

3757
02:49:17,190 --> 02:49:19,770
If you can't control them,
if you can't stop them,

3758
02:49:19,771 --> 02:49:24,030
they overcome the same way the Europeans
overcame the American Indians.

3759
02:49:24,110 --> 02:49:29,110
I mean,
it's really the same exact thing you're 

3760
02:49:29,110 --> 02:49:30,831
talking about.
You're talking about people being 

3761
02:49:30,831 --> 02:49:32,541
overcome by other people.
There's only one way to prevent with 

3762
02:49:32,541 --> 02:49:34,851
technology people that are armed the.
That's the only way to prevent that is 

3763
02:49:34,851 --> 02:49:38,131
to.
The threat of retaliation is too strong 

3764
02:49:38,131 --> 02:49:41,080
for one band of evil people to just go 
in and take over a town or whatever with

3765
02:49:41,081 --> 02:49:46,081
with guns because otherwise,
how could you stop it if the whole 

3766
02:49:46,081 --> 02:49:48,180
world,
the whole world was disarmed a Wa,

3767
02:49:48,620 --> 02:49:51,560
then you're talking about like some sort
of Africa.

3768
02:49:51,600 --> 02:49:55,140
Look at the Congo right now with people 
like Joseph Kony and his group and stuff

3769
02:49:55,141 --> 02:49:57,180
who come in.
They've got military grade weapons.

3770
02:49:57,181 --> 02:49:59,160
They come into a village where nobody 
has any weapons,

3771
02:49:59,390 --> 02:50:04,390
do whatever they want.
I mean the utopia obviously we'd be no 

3772
02:50:04,390 --> 02:50:05,880
one has guns and you know,
if you go hunting,

3773
02:50:05,881 --> 02:50:08,810
then he used guns.
I guess the Utopia.

3774
02:50:08,840 --> 02:50:13,840
What if you did have that?
Then you'd have guys like chain carbon 

3775
02:50:13,840 --> 02:50:15,640
and nate mark or who would be the kings 
and call the shots because I'm not going

3776
02:50:15,641 --> 02:50:17,910
to fight those guys.
We'd have to band together.

3777
02:50:17,911 --> 02:50:19,500
It's like six guys and be like,
let's go.

3778
02:50:19,740 --> 02:50:23,700
So you know,
it's better to have a.

3779
02:50:23,750 --> 02:50:28,750
it's sort of a balancing act and it's 
better to have some sort of an ability 

3780
02:50:28,750 --> 02:50:33,201
to defend yourself physically and then 
society can move on and if you can't 

3781
02:50:33,201 --> 02:50:37,611
defend yourself physically just because 
of your size and you're dealing with 

3782
02:50:37,611 --> 02:50:38,130
some Shaquille o'neal type do that.

3783
02:50:38,130 --> 02:50:39,900
You just physically,
there's nothing you can do about it.

3784
02:50:40,380 --> 02:50:41,310
Then a gun comes into,
well,

3785
02:50:41,311 --> 02:50:46,311
they always say they say conflict 
resolution in any society becomes 

3786
02:50:46,311 --> 02:50:46,450
paramount like in a,
in.

3787
02:50:46,451 --> 02:50:48,180
In a.
In a society,

3788
02:50:48,181 --> 02:50:53,181
you have to have a mechanism for 
conflict resolution because inevitably 

3789
02:50:53,181 --> 02:50:57,291
there will be conflict among men and so 
how you meet out justice and how you 

3790
02:50:57,361 --> 02:51:00,570
keep order is very important for any 
society.

3791
02:51:00,571 --> 02:51:03,540
If you think about it,
inevitably there's going to be conflict.

3792
02:51:03,600 --> 02:51:06,270
I think the thing we're missing is 
teaching young kids how to fight.

3793
02:51:06,360 --> 02:51:11,360
I really do.
I think it's a gigantic piece of the 

3794
02:51:11,360 --> 02:51:11,360
puzzle that were missing in the way we 
raise human beings.

3795
02:51:11,360 --> 02:51:13,620
I'm not saying everybody needs it.
I'm not saying it should be required,

3796
02:51:13,920 --> 02:51:18,920
but I'm not.
I'm saying that having it readily 

3797
02:51:18,920 --> 02:51:20,871
available all the time for kids in 
school to teach them a way to get out 

3798
02:51:20,871 --> 02:51:23,250
their aggression and not just 
necessarily defense,

3799
02:51:23,251 --> 02:51:24,690
but also just dealing with,
well,

3800
02:51:24,691 --> 02:51:26,830
let's stop again.

3801
02:51:26,860 --> 02:51:29,070
I think it would stop bullying.
I really do.

3802
02:51:29,071 --> 02:51:34,071
I think if you taught kids martial arts 
would stop almost all bullying because 

3803
02:51:34,071 --> 02:51:35,970
kids would be involved in competition 
and when they're involved in competition

3804
02:51:35,971 --> 02:51:40,971
and not thinking about picking on weak 
people thinking about how to advance a 

3805
02:51:40,971 --> 02:51:44,760
game so they can compete in whether it's
Jujitsu or wrestling or boxing or any,

3806
02:51:44,761 --> 02:51:45,330
any,
any,

3807
02:51:45,331 --> 02:51:50,331
any of those martial sports.
I think if you teach as many people as 

3808
02:51:50,581 --> 02:51:51,810
you can,
how to do it,

3809
02:51:52,020 --> 02:51:54,600
you're gonna have a much more polite 
society,

3810
02:51:54,950 --> 02:51:56,520
you know,
and that outlet is very strong.

3811
02:51:56,521 --> 02:52:01,521
That's where they say,
that's why they say video games are so 

3812
02:52:01,521 --> 02:52:01,521
popular.
It's an.

3813
02:52:01,521 --> 02:52:02,610
It's an outlet for our problem in this 
country.

3814
02:52:02,611 --> 02:52:03,620
Countries,
not a gun problem.

3815
02:52:03,940 --> 02:52:08,940
Opinion.
Everybody keeps saying it's a gun 

3816
02:52:08,940 --> 02:52:08,940
problem.

3817
02:52:08,940 --> 02:52:08,940
Guns are a part of a mental health 
problem.

3818
02:52:09,040 --> 02:52:11,410
It's a mental health problem.
It's these old people,

3819
02:52:11,411 --> 02:52:14,200
but people look at that as being 
something that they can achieve easily,

3820
02:52:14,201 --> 02:52:19,201
but the thing that I've been thinking a 
lot about lately on the issue is that 

3821
02:52:19,201 --> 02:52:21,580
it's the way that people look at like 
constitutional freedoms.

3822
02:52:21,610 --> 02:52:26,200
I think there's a reluctance on the 
right this traditionally this reluctance

3823
02:52:26,201 --> 02:52:31,201
to sort of disregard first amendment 
liberties sometimes and and on the left 

3824
02:52:31,201 --> 02:52:35,500
there's this tendency to want to like 
disregard second amendment liberties in 

3825
02:52:35,500 --> 02:52:37,420
the same way that someone,
this guy that said,

3826
02:52:37,421 --> 02:52:38,020
well,
you know what,

3827
02:52:38,640 --> 02:52:39,730
if you hunt tough,
you know,

3828
02:52:39,770 --> 02:52:41,380
figure something out.
You could look and say,

3829
02:52:41,381 --> 02:52:46,381
you know what?
The Internet is used for all these 

3830
02:52:46,381 --> 02:52:48,841
things and in like nine slash 11 
plotters communicated over the Internet 

3831
02:52:48,841 --> 02:52:51,730
and various things.
So if you use the Internet for 

3832
02:52:51,730 --> 02:52:51,730
communication,
screw you,

3833
02:52:51,730 --> 02:52:51,940
we're getting rid of it.

3834
02:52:52,670 --> 02:52:55,930
It was like no one would ever make the 
case like we can be used for evil,

3835
02:52:55,931 --> 02:52:57,170
therefore it should go away.
You know,

3836
02:52:57,230 --> 02:53:02,230
it's just not a very good point.
You want to be in a situation where I'm 

3837
02:53:02,230 --> 02:53:05,341
like,
for me it's like first amendment stuff 

3838
02:53:05,341 --> 02:53:09,030
extremely important to me.
Second Amendment issues are extremely 

3839
02:53:09,030 --> 02:53:09,030
important to me,
like I,

3840
02:53:09,030 --> 02:53:12,220
I feel that just to do reactionary 
measures against our amendment rights in

3841
02:53:12,221 --> 02:53:14,990
thinking we're going to solve some 
problem isn't right the same way.

3842
02:53:15,000 --> 02:53:20,000
I don't think it's the right to suppress
freedom of speech in order to in order 

3843
02:53:20,000 --> 02:53:22,921
to like solve a problem that might have 
come out of the right of assembly or 

3844
02:53:22,921 --> 02:53:26,341
that might've come out of freedom of the
press that someone incited violence to 

3845
02:53:26,341 --> 02:53:28,961
the press so they should be shut down.
Nor do I think that firearms owners 

3846
02:53:28,961 --> 02:53:28,961
should be shut down.

3847
02:53:28,961 --> 02:53:33,180
I think it's a very complicated issue 
and I think it also fosters some cookie 

3848
02:53:33,180 --> 02:53:36,571
cutter type thinking.
Sometimes the people on the left just 

3849
02:53:36,571 --> 02:53:39,931
follow that predetermined pattern and 
behavior and people in the right follow 

3850
02:53:39,931 --> 02:53:40,750
that.
No one is excited.

3851
02:53:41,170 --> 02:53:44,110
Everybody's taking a side on it and I 
suppose we're pushing it as a problem to

3852
02:53:44,111 --> 02:53:45,200
solve.
Look,

3853
02:53:45,700 --> 02:53:47,800
there's obviously something going on.
What is the problem?

3854
02:53:47,801 --> 02:53:49,180
It's the problem is that everybody has 
guns.

3855
02:53:49,181 --> 02:53:52,210
That way you can't stop me.
Everyone would shoot the guy if he tried

3856
02:53:52,211 --> 02:53:54,040
to run into a school and shoot people.
Is that,

3857
02:53:54,100 --> 02:53:59,100
is that the solution or is this solution
that you have to pull all the guns out 

3858
02:53:59,100 --> 02:53:59,860
of people's homes and then the only the 
military has the guns.

3859
02:54:00,280 --> 02:54:05,280
Oh,
people are going to be comfortable with 

3860
02:54:05,280 --> 02:54:05,280
that either.
So what,

3861
02:54:05,280 --> 02:54:07,601
what,
what is the correct solution and how 

3862
02:54:07,601 --> 02:54:07,601
much is mental health taken into it?

3863
02:54:07,601 --> 02:54:11,490
How much are SSR,
i's and whatever these fucking 

3864
02:54:11,490 --> 02:54:11,490
antidepressants are doing to disturbed 
people.

3865
02:54:11,760 --> 02:54:16,760
You know,
there's a lot of people out there that 

3866
02:54:16,760 --> 02:54:16,760
need antidepressants.
It makes their life better.

3867
02:54:16,760 --> 02:54:16,760
I,
I've heard that.

3868
02:54:16,760 --> 02:54:18,820
I believe it,
but I also know Phil Hartman,

3869
02:54:18,850 --> 02:54:23,850
I knew Phil Hartman very well and his 
wife was on antidepressants when she 

3870
02:54:23,850 --> 02:54:23,860
shot and killed him and then kill 
herself.

3871
02:54:24,310 --> 02:54:26,260
So you know,
I know that it is.

3872
02:54:26,290 --> 02:54:31,290
They want a settlement with Zoloft.
I know that stuff creates psychotic 

3873
02:54:31,290 --> 02:54:31,300
behavior.
I know it does.

3874
02:54:31,570 --> 02:54:32,350
It's,
it's pretty,

3875
02:54:32,590 --> 02:54:34,980
pretty much proven.
You know,

3876
02:54:34,981 --> 02:54:39,981
when,
when you start having to pay off giant 

3877
02:54:39,981 --> 02:54:42,781
sums,
it's pretty proven that there's 

3878
02:54:42,781 --> 02:54:44,761
something fucked up going on with 
antidepressants and the human mind and 

3879
02:54:44,761 --> 02:54:47,110
it's not always,
but it's not everybody.

3880
02:54:47,111 --> 02:54:52,111
I think there's people that their brain 
is just not set up correctly.

3881
02:54:53,680 --> 02:54:58,680
I think there's a whole bunch of people 
in this world where they got a shitty 

3882
02:54:58,680 --> 02:55:02,500
roll the dice and their brain is just 
not working good and I think if you want

3883
02:55:02,501 --> 02:55:03,980
to medicate people and

3884
02:55:03,980 --> 02:55:06,500
just start throwing chemicals at the 
problem,

3885
02:55:06,770 --> 02:55:11,770
you might not always be doing the right 
thing and when you do that and you have 

3886
02:55:11,770 --> 02:55:15,521
a really disturbed individual,
like it's in the case of over and over 

3887
02:55:15,521 --> 02:55:15,521
again with some of these shooters.
The,

3888
02:55:15,521 --> 02:55:20,220
the hypothesis is that these drugs are 
allowing these kids to much more easily 

3889
02:55:20,871 --> 02:55:24,700
performed horrific tasks because they've
sort of changed reality.

3890
02:55:24,710 --> 02:55:26,750
That body's chemistry or.
Yeah,

3891
02:55:26,751 --> 02:55:29,330
well the blade,
the way they interact with the mind that

3892
02:55:29,331 --> 02:55:34,331
they allow you to accept things in a way
that you would normally have like giant 

3893
02:55:34,331 --> 02:55:35,630
red psychological flags going off left 
and right.

3894
02:55:35,870 --> 02:55:38,270
And instead it just allows you to like 
deal with shit.

3895
02:55:38,480 --> 02:55:42,290
And that's one of the ways that for some
folks it helps them overcome depression.

3896
02:55:42,620 --> 02:55:47,620
You know?
It's like these things are very unusual 

3897
02:55:47,620 --> 02:55:48,020
because one of the things that I've 
learned talking to my friends that,

3898
02:55:48,170 --> 02:55:50,870
uh,
Romney's antidepressants,

3899
02:55:51,050 --> 02:55:56,050
including people that absolutely need 
them and then people who've tried them 

3900
02:55:56,050 --> 02:55:58,940
and gave them away is that they never 
know exactly which one's going to work 

3901
02:55:58,940 --> 02:55:59,770
for you and they'll switch medications 
on your like,

3902
02:55:59,790 --> 02:56:00,680
okay,
let's try this.

3903
02:56:00,770 --> 02:56:03,380
How's that one?
And then a lot of it is just everybody's

3904
02:56:03,440 --> 02:56:08,440
got a different setup and what works for
you might not work for him and the only 

3905
02:56:08,440 --> 02:56:09,290
way to tell is they gotta fucking try 
shit out on you.

3906
02:56:09,860 --> 02:56:14,860
I have a real hard problem with that.
When you're dealing with psychotic 

3907
02:56:14,860 --> 02:56:14,860
people that might have access to assault
rifles.

3908
02:56:14,860 --> 02:56:19,780
Like when you have that,
those things together and then you find 

3909
02:56:19,780 --> 02:56:22,421
out that 90 percent of all these school 
shootings are either someone is on 

3910
02:56:22,421 --> 02:56:24,200
withdrawal from Ssri or someone who's on
them.

3911
02:56:24,800 --> 02:56:28,250
Ninety percent of that they were talking
that these mental health experts on.

3912
02:56:28,251 --> 02:56:30,120
They were talking about like jared 
lauffner,

3913
02:56:30,121 --> 02:56:34,880
the guy who shot the Arizona.
He had been symptomatic for 10 years.

3914
02:56:35,420 --> 02:56:38,750
He was psychotic and symptomatic and it 
was very clear that,

3915
02:56:38,810 --> 02:56:40,720
you know,
and the problem was he said that there's

3916
02:56:40,820 --> 02:56:45,820
in the law,
you can't incarcerate somebody against 

3917
02:56:45,820 --> 02:56:45,820
their will unless they are.

3918
02:56:45,820 --> 02:56:46,100
Would love to hear this.
We're going to wrap this up.

3919
02:56:46,130 --> 02:56:47,520
It's 3:00
hurts.

3920
02:56:47,690 --> 02:56:51,400
Rather it's three hours in,
three hours in the show.

3921
02:56:51,450 --> 02:56:52,890
Turns into a Pumpkin.
We go.

3922
02:56:53,300 --> 02:56:54,680
What happens is the,
uh,

3923
02:56:54,681 --> 02:56:56,480
the audio,
when it gets too long,

3924
02:56:56,840 --> 02:57:01,840
gets fucked somehow in the process.
So the only way we could do is three 

3925
02:57:01,840 --> 02:57:01,840
hours.
Yeah.

3926
02:57:01,840 --> 02:57:04,580
So we turn into a pumpkin.
