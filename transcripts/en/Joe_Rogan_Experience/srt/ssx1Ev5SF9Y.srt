1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,400
That's why you have a producer,
jamie is on the ball.

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:03,940
Talk a little closer to the light.

3
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:05,560
Yeah,
get that sucker right up to you.

4
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,360
Just pull it.
You need to move it around.

5
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:09,730
Bring it to you.
You don't want to feel uncomfortable.

6
00:00:09,731 --> 00:00:13,280
These chairs that shit on it.
Well,

7
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,080
I've.
Oh,

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:14,621
we're live,
live,

9
00:00:14,621 --> 00:00:15,191
live,
live,

10
00:00:15,191 --> 00:00:15,551
live,
live.

11
00:00:15,551 --> 00:00:16,384
Oh,
uh,

12
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:19,020
I'm here with my good pal.
Ryan Callahan.

13
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:20,710
How are you buddy?
I'm doing swell.

14
00:00:20,711 --> 00:00:21,544
How are you doing his good pal.
Ken Kruth met you before at the first 

15
00:00:24,851 --> 00:00:26,950
light booth at the shot.
Show those the first time I met you,

16
00:00:26,951 --> 00:00:27,940
right?
I think so.

17
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:28,970
I think that's it.
Yeah.

18
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:33,310
And we wanted to have you guys on,
first of all because I like,

19
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:35,230
I love your company.
You guys got a great company.

20
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:37,900
Firstlight makes really cool hunting 
clothes,

21
00:00:37,901 --> 00:00:40,600
outdoor clothes made out of you.
Started out with Merino wool,

22
00:00:40,601 --> 00:00:41,434
which I think uh,
before I went with Ryan and Steven 

23
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:46,023
Rinella,
I really had no idea about the 

24
00:00:47,471 --> 00:00:48,640
properties of Merino wool.

25
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,490
I didn't know that it keeps you from 
stinking that it,

26
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,940
that it really retains heat while you're
wet.

27
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:57,160
So it's got so many awesome properties 
to it,

28
00:00:57,161 --> 00:00:59,080
like if you go out for people that don't
know,

29
00:00:59,081 --> 00:00:59,914
that don't go in the outdoors,
but if you go out and you walk and it's 

30
00:01:02,711 --> 00:01:06,040
cold out and you hike like a long 
distance and you get sweaty,

31
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:08,860
if you're wearing cotton,
you're kind of fucked.

32
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,740
If it's really cold out,
once you start getting sweaty,

33
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:14,680
your body starts shivering and you get 
in a real bad place.

34
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:15,903
We'll has this really weird quality and 
maybe you can help me explain that 

35
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:21,490
where,
when it gets wet,

36
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,410
it somehow or another still retains 
heat.

37
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:27,190
So if you sweat in it,
you still feel okay,

38
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,690
I kinda know what's going on there.

39
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:29,280
Well,
it,

40
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,310
you know,
it just naturally moves the sweat off of

41
00:01:32,311 --> 00:01:33,144
your skin and kind of tries to get it to
the outermost layer and at which point 

42
00:01:36,871 --> 00:01:38,910
then it can evaporate fast.
But,

43
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:39,691
um,
you know,

44
00:01:39,691 --> 00:01:41,770
she passed to live in crazy 
environments,

45
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:42,613
you know,
it'll be hotter than shit in the 

46
00:01:42,991 --> 00:01:45,210
summertime and then,
um,

47
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,730
you know,
super cold in the winter.

48
00:01:47,731 --> 00:01:48,510
So,
you know,

49
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:50,730
over the course of evolution,
they've got,

50
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:51,803
you know,
a coat that will deal with a massive 

51
00:01:53,581 --> 00:01:55,270
amount of variance,
you know,

52
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:59,760
and will was pretty much the same.
It's like you can wear it when it's,

53
00:01:59,761 --> 00:02:02,190
when you're sweating,
bullets at pulls a sweat off and then,

54
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,230
um,
dries pretty quickly,

55
00:02:04,231 --> 00:02:06,360
but even when it's wet it pretends to 80
percent of its heat.

56
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,540
Yeah,
it's amazing.

57
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:08,523
It's amazing stuff.
And is there a synthetic material that 

58
00:02:12,221 --> 00:02:12,980
does the same thing?

59
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:13,813
Well,
every synthetic is trying to a mimic 

60
00:02:16,311 --> 00:02:20,780
down or be mimicked Merino wool because 
those are the two most efficient,

61
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,230
um,
you know,

62
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,533
temperature,
regulating fabrics or materials out 

63
00:02:26,331 --> 00:02:27,540
there.
Um,

64
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:30,070
and that's,
that's how you got into your prima lofts

65
00:02:30,071 --> 00:02:30,904
and your all,
your military testing and that's where 

66
00:02:33,261 --> 00:02:36,390
you saw synthetics really take off.
Um,

67
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:41,180
so yeah,
so like a prima law for example,

68
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,360
or some of your fleeces,
they basically,

69
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,433
um,
combined something that loves water and 

70
00:02:46,941 --> 00:02:47,774
something that hates water.
So the thing that love loves water is 

71
00:02:50,181 --> 00:02:51,014
going to pull moisture off and the thing
that hates it is going to repel it and 

72
00:02:53,871 --> 00:02:55,040
try to push it to the outside.

73
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,340
That's interesting.
So it's like sort of a two layer process

74
00:02:58,341 --> 00:02:59,174
where something's trying to keep you dry
and something is trying to like 

75
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:02,914
literally suck up the wet,
like a sponge and then somehow or 

76
00:03:05,471 --> 00:03:09,160
another your body heat then can regulate
it because your body heat,

77
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,073
you're staying warm because the dry is 
close to your skin and then the heat 

78
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:16,480
comes off your skin and it can dry out 
that stuff better.

79
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:17,391
Yeah,
exactly.

80
00:03:17,391 --> 00:03:19,680
In your body heat,
you're like your natural,

81
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:23,130
you know,
your natural zone,

82
00:03:23,131 --> 00:03:27,090
how much heat and how much moisture you 
push out is a major factor.

83
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:32,220
Um,
and especially when you get into some of

84
00:03:32,221 --> 00:03:34,240
your waterproof breathable,
um,

85
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,060
membranes and things like that.

86
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,093
That's something that I think really 
would surprise a lot of people when it 

87
00:03:41,281 --> 00:03:42,114
comes to hunting clothing.
They really would have no idea like how 

88
00:03:45,691 --> 00:03:47,100
much,
how much,

89
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,570
how technical the stuff is and how much 
thought is put into it.

90
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:52,770
And how,
how,

91
00:03:52,771 --> 00:03:55,710
like involve the processes of creating 
this stuff.

92
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:56,663
You know,
it's funny because we all kind of came 

93
00:03:58,081 --> 00:03:59,880
from the traditional,
like ski,

94
00:03:59,881 --> 00:04:01,560
snowboard,
snowmobile world,

95
00:04:01,561 --> 00:04:03,570
you know,
grew up skiing.

96
00:04:03,571 --> 00:04:06,410
And so we've been,
you know,

97
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:11,570
involved in having super technical 
clothes since I was eight years old.

98
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:12,380
Right,
right.

99
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:16,230
All the underwear stuff,
Merino wool,

100
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:17,123
all the different policies when that 
Kinda came out and replaced cotton when 

101
00:04:19,141 --> 00:04:21,150
I was a kid and you know,
um,

102
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:22,163
they were great.
But it wasn't until we kind of started 

103
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:28,140
using marina that we found something 
that,

104
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:29,070
I mean,
you know,

105
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:32,400
if you go skiing or snowboarding or some
sledding snowmobiling,

106
00:04:32,401 --> 00:04:33,234
right,
you sweating bullets and if you get 

107
00:04:34,711 --> 00:04:35,670
stinky,
whatever,

108
00:04:35,671 --> 00:04:37,470
it's just how it always was,
you know.

109
00:04:37,471 --> 00:04:40,470
But for hunting,
it's a really a big deal,

110
00:04:40,471 --> 00:04:41,304
you know,
if you can possibly kind of shrink your 

111
00:04:43,891 --> 00:04:44,724
stink footprint just by a little bit,
it can be the difference between 

112
00:04:47,461 --> 00:04:49,150
succeeding that season or not,
you know?

113
00:04:49,151 --> 00:04:52,490
And so we all started wearing Marino for
whatever,

114
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,760
you know,
all of the other sports,

115
00:04:53,761 --> 00:04:55,230
you know,
like skiing and snowboarding and,

116
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,220
you know,
pedal,

117
00:04:56,221 --> 00:04:57,150
bike and,
and whatever.

118
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,293
Um,
and once we found out that it didn't 

119
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,900
stink,
that was like,

120
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:02,370
Whoa,
that was a big deal,

121
00:05:02,371 --> 00:05:03,204
you know,
because you could wear it for days and 

122
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:06,630
days.
And so that was kind of the impetus.

123
00:05:06,631 --> 00:05:08,610
And at the same time I started taking 
over,

124
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,400
I would say the traditional outdoor 
space,

125
00:05:11,401 --> 00:05:12,031
you know?
Yeah.

126
00:05:12,031 --> 00:05:12,590
And you're.
Nobody

127
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:16,510
is really popular with public land do it
yourself.

128
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:17,363
Hunters,
guys who go out backpacking for long 

129
00:05:20,471 --> 00:05:21,304
periods of time.
And that's one of the reasons why they 

130
00:05:22,481 --> 00:05:23,314
liked that Merino wool.
And one of the reasons why I wanted you 

131
00:05:24,601 --> 00:05:25,434
to have you guys on this,
just talk about what's been going on 

132
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:31,600
lately with a hr six,
21 and now hr six slash 22.

133
00:05:31,601 --> 00:05:34,960
These two recent bills.
They pulled her 6:21,

134
00:05:34,961 --> 00:05:36,730
Steven Rinella wrote a big article about
it.

135
00:05:36,731 --> 00:05:37,564
But for the uninitiated,
what these bills are about is there 

136
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:41,363
about selling off our public land,
giving the states the ability to do 

137
00:05:47,081 --> 00:05:49,600
whatever they want with it right now,
these lands or federal,

138
00:05:49,601 --> 00:05:51,580
they're owned by the people of the 
United States.

139
00:05:51,581 --> 00:05:54,160
It's a very unusual situation that we 
have here.

140
00:05:54,161 --> 00:05:54,994
It's an amazing situation and there's 
very few countries in the world that 

141
00:05:57,981 --> 00:05:58,814
have anything even remotely close to it 
where there's millions and millions and 

142
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:06,470
millions of acres that are available for
anybody listening to this to go on you.

143
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:07,383
It's literally your land like back 
country hunters and anglers have that 

144
00:06:09,861 --> 00:06:10,694
great shirt that I wear all the time.
It says public land owner and I've seen 

145
00:06:12,621 --> 00:06:13,454
you on it.
And I'm going to tweet the picture of 

146
00:06:14,181 --> 00:06:19,181
you and I from shot show where I was.
I was with you and you were wearing that

147
00:06:19,641 --> 00:06:20,490
shirt.
Yeah.

148
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,473
That's such an important point for 
people because I didn't know it at all 

149
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:29,180
until I went with you guys until I went 
with Rinella and the crew.

150
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,290
Uh,
we went to Montana.

151
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:32,480
That first trip with Brian Kaplan who's 
hopefully coming.

152
00:06:32,481 --> 00:06:33,650
That's why that door's open,
folks,

153
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:34,963
if you're watching this,
we're leaving that door open because 

154
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,390
Collin is trying to make his way over 
here right now,

155
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:39,913
but I didn't know that this public land 
system even existed and I think most 

156
00:06:44,061 --> 00:06:45,860
people are unaware.
They just don't.

157
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:50,890
They don't understand how unique this is
and how incredible like the,

158
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,370
our forefathers,
like their,

159
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,213
their,
their vision to make something so 

160
00:06:55,011 --> 00:06:58,850
incredible that no one can go in and 
just fucking put malls up in

161
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:03,500
it is an amazing thing and I think this 
is like the easiest battle in the world.

162
00:07:03,501 --> 00:07:04,334
If we can somehow tell people your kid 
communicate even a fraction of our 

163
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:13,550
appreciation for it.
It's just,

164
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:16,670
it is the reason I get up in the 
morning.

165
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:17,813
Well,
especially where you guys are 

166
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:21,240
[inaudible],
you guys are like,

167
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,133
you're in the boondocks man.
I mean you guys are in Idaho and you're 

168
00:07:26,221 --> 00:07:29,730
in a beautiful area,
but you could literally like go out your

169
00:07:29,731 --> 00:07:34,731
back door and make a straight line 
through public land for forever.

170
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:37,710
Like you could just go walk and 
disappear.

171
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:38,613
Oh yeah.
I mean,

172
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,410
we can walk straight north and cross,
uh,

173
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:47,050
uh,
two highways and one interstate and keep

174
00:07:47,051 --> 00:07:47,884
going across the Canadian border,
cross to more highways and be in the 

175
00:07:52,871 --> 00:07:56,470
Yukon basically.
So it's a wild junker ground.

176
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:58,100
It's amazing.
It is.

177
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,800
And it's open to everybody.
Everybody,

178
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:01,370
you know,
it's,

179
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:04,030
it's an interesting issue because 
sometimes you know,

180
00:08:04,031 --> 00:08:04,864
you'll get mountain bikers,
you get after the equestrian people or 

181
00:08:08,051 --> 00:08:08,884
the.
Yeah,

182
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:12,280
the,
the hikers get after the motor bikers,

183
00:08:12,281 --> 00:08:13,114
but it's an issue for every single 
person because no matter what sport you 

184
00:08:17,591 --> 00:08:20,440
do or how you choose to enjoy the 
outdoors,

185
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:23,200
that's your land.
Once that's gone,

186
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,153
it's gone.

187
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,090
Yeah.
I mean and there are regulations like as

188
00:08:26,091 --> 00:08:29,970
far as where you can take motorbikes or 
where you can ride even bikes,

189
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,100
right?
Even trail bikes,

190
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,950
but that set aside,
man,

191
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:38,450
there's some amazing country that you 
could just go get lost in.

192
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:40,100
Just go wander,
pitch a tent,

193
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:41,263
drink out of a stream and you could stay
there for long periods of time and it's 

194
00:08:44,721 --> 00:08:46,730
totally legal.
It's totally yours.

195
00:08:46,731 --> 00:08:47,564
Your tax dollars literally fund and 
support it and all the money that comes 

196
00:08:51,441 --> 00:08:52,274
from buying hunting equipment,
from buying tags from all that stuff is 

197
00:08:56,701 --> 00:08:57,534
what pays to keep fishing game employed,
makes sure that people are monitoring 

198
00:09:03,781 --> 00:09:04,614
the health and the populations of the 
animals that live there and making sure 

199
00:09:07,711 --> 00:09:10,050
that no one is breaking any laws.
I mean,

200
00:09:10,051 --> 00:09:12,210
it's really an amazing,
amazing system.

201
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,170
It is.
It's unreal.

202
00:09:14,171 --> 00:09:17,230
And I want to clarify a couple of 
things.

203
00:09:17,231 --> 00:09:19,690
You like.
All these national forests.

204
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:24,710
I'm at any blm grounds.
They all have their own regulations.

205
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:26,164
So yeah,
you can have of land management for 

206
00:09:28,361 --> 00:09:31,750
folks that drill weekend manager.
You guys are deep on the inside.

207
00:09:31,751 --> 00:09:33,160
You're gonna.
Most people listen to us on a,

208
00:09:33,161 --> 00:09:35,380
what the fuck I'm talking about.
That's right.

209
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:39,580
So different for us.
Have different regulations as far as how

210
00:09:39,581 --> 00:09:42,700
long you can stay camped in one spot.
Um,

211
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:43,653
typically it's 10 to 15 days and then 
you have to move again depending on 

212
00:09:49,601 --> 00:09:52,720
where you are.
X amount of,

213
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,820
you know,
sometimes it's 100 feet,

214
00:09:54,821 --> 00:09:57,600
sometimes it's 20 miles.
Um,

215
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,340
and then you can set up camp again,
just arbitrary rules.

216
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:01,563
It is not arbitrary.
There's some smart folks out there that 

217
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,350
I'm study the impact of man on the land 
and they want to try to keep,

218
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:09,493
you know,
that pristine experience that we all 

219
00:10:10,961 --> 00:10:13,840
love to go find right there for 
everybody.

220
00:10:13,841 --> 00:10:17,170
And they have an incredibly tough job 
because their mandate,

221
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:22,530
their federal mandate is to manage that 
land for everyone.

222
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,323
How did you guys become a company that's
so connected in people that do go into 

223
00:10:29,821 --> 00:10:32,400
the outdoors and people that do hunt 
and,

224
00:10:32,401 --> 00:10:34,380
you know,
enjoy your products.

225
00:10:34,381 --> 00:10:39,381
You guys are like really connected to 
public land conservation and you know,

226
00:10:39,761 --> 00:10:42,390
and these do it yourself,
public land sportsman,

227
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:45,420
like you guys are like very,
very connected in that world.

228
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,493
Like it's very,
it's a very respected company in that 

229
00:10:48,901 --> 00:10:49,460
world.

230
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,390
Thanks.
I mean,

231
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:52,730
you know,
we do,

232
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,470
we see it from all angles,
you know,

233
00:10:54,471 --> 00:10:55,790
all of us have.
And you know,

234
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,170
in the summertime we'll,
like I said,

235
00:10:57,171 --> 00:11:00,110
we'll ride mountain bikes and the 
wintertime backcountry skiing.

236
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,970
It's all of a sudden,
you know,

237
00:11:01,971 --> 00:11:03,920
and then hunting,
of course it's huge.

238
00:11:03,921 --> 00:11:04,754
But you just see it from all angles,
like places that where you recreate 365 

239
00:11:11,031 --> 00:11:11,864
days a year,
all of a sudden you start to get sucked 

240
00:11:13,431 --> 00:11:15,440
up and it's just like,
wait a minute,

241
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:16,280
wait a minute.
You know,

242
00:11:16,281 --> 00:11:18,890
like if this wasn't,
if we didn't have public lands,

243
00:11:18,891 --> 00:11:20,360
we wouldn't have a business,
right.

244
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:21,440
It,
it,

245
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:23,140
it would just wouldn't exist.
You know,

246
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:24,693
decision.
Our board of trustees didn't say it's 

247
00:11:27,131 --> 00:11:29,450
high time.
You

248
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:32,520
look at the United States being only 
founded in 17,

249
00:11:32,521 --> 00:11:37,500
76 and you just look at the massive 
amount of land we occupy now with.

250
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,353
There's just a greater Los Angeles area 
where there's 30 million people and you 

251
00:11:41,281 --> 00:11:42,114
know,
you go up all through the Pacific coast 

252
00:11:43,741 --> 00:11:44,574
highway and just see all the cities and 
see all the buildings and see all the 

253
00:11:47,101 --> 00:11:47,934
stuff that you would encounter if you 
try to try to drive from California to 

254
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:52,644
New York.
The only thing that's stopping that 

255
00:11:54,611 --> 00:11:55,444
whole fucking area from being covered 
with buildings and malls and gas 

256
00:11:58,571 --> 00:11:59,404
stations and anything else they can 
stick in there is the fact that it's 

257
00:12:02,591 --> 00:12:04,190
public land.
It's that.

258
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,093
It's,
it's federally owned land and you can't 

259
00:12:06,911 --> 00:12:08,710
build on it.
There's some folks that want.

260
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:09,600
They want it.

261
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,433
We drove that,
what does it trip Panga Topanga Canyon 

262
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,540
and I was like,
oh,

263
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:17,160
there's a good looking house.
And I was like,

264
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:19,500
Oh God,
there's houses everywhere in here.

265
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:20,903
And then we came around the corner and 
there's a sign that says open space x 

266
00:12:24,811 --> 00:12:26,160
amount.
And I was like,

267
00:12:26,161 --> 00:12:27,960
yeah,
cover that to open space up.

268
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:33,040
Gary said that open space that opened.
Wonder what they mean by that.

269
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:34,160
Whenever it's like,
oh,

270
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:36,540
orange sign on it right there.
And it was like,

271
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:38,110
like a park.
Oh No,

272
00:12:38,111 --> 00:12:42,980
like a for sale sign for sale.
Still Open.

273
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,160
Yeah.
There's a lot of development up there.

274
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:49,480
Topanga is very unusual though because 
if you live in Los Angeles,

275
00:12:49,481 --> 00:12:52,630
you could be in Topanga and look like 
you're in the woods.

276
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,010
It's cool.
I got gotta say,

277
00:12:54,011 --> 00:12:56,590
and then right now it's all greened up.
It's beautiful right now.

278
00:12:56,591 --> 00:12:57,424
It's spectacular right now.
I mean it would trick you if you came 

279
00:13:00,131 --> 00:13:01,120
here from somewhere else,
like,

280
00:13:01,121 --> 00:13:02,830
oh my God,
this is the most beautiful place ever.

281
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,450
When you come back in August,
you're like,

282
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:07,120
this is a fire hazard.
We gotta get Outta here.

283
00:13:07,121 --> 00:13:07,954
Everything's dry.
And people were throwing cigarettes out 

284
00:13:09,281 --> 00:13:10,950
their car.
Windows Kenton's this year.

285
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,000
Yes.
Audio files.

286
00:13:12,001 --> 00:13:14,170
So when you're driving up the road,
you know,

287
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,880
we opted to go over the specific coast 
highway and then come over that way.

288
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,193
Um,
Adelaide,

289
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,940
La and it's like,
Oh man,

290
00:13:20,941 --> 00:13:21,774
I bet neil young.

291
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:26,260
Yeah,
I bet he had.

292
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:28,980
I mean there was a house that was for 
sale in Topanga.

293
00:13:28,981 --> 00:13:29,814
Then I found out about it before it was,
it was already sold by the time I found 

294
00:13:31,981 --> 00:13:32,814
out about it,
but it was a house that Jimi Hendrix 

295
00:13:34,381 --> 00:13:35,400
owned.
It's like,

296
00:13:35,401 --> 00:13:36,234
fuck,
I would buy a house that Jimmy Hendrix 

297
00:13:38,101 --> 00:13:40,640
owned it.
The garbage can that.

298
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,090
Yeah.
I mean that whole place was just hippies

299
00:13:45,091 --> 00:13:47,040
galore up there.
It's a really interesting spot.

300
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:48,080
Yeah.
Oh,

301
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,870
six,
21 hr six,

302
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:51,970
21.
Uh,

303
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:55,740
what does hr stand for it?
I believe it's house rule,

304
00:13:55,741 --> 00:13:56,574
right?
Is that right?

305
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:58,860
So now we're going to have to google 
that up.

306
00:13:58,861 --> 00:13:59,694
I'm,
I'm not real good on some of the notes 

307
00:14:02,101 --> 00:14:03,090
here.
And we'll get it for us.

308
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:08,510
Six 21 was um,
basically to authorize the sale of pre,

309
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:14,250
uh,
approved lions.

310
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,113
Three point $3,
million acres of a federal federally 

311
00:14:20,281 --> 00:14:25,281
managed land that had been designated as
I'm basically disposable,

312
00:14:27,421 --> 00:14:27,940
right?

313
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:28,773
No.
How did they decide what disposable and 

314
00:14:30,711 --> 00:14:32,170
what's not?
Fantastic?

315
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:32,660
Asked a question

316
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:35,550
I've asked a ton and I don't know.
I don't know.

317
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,570
I certainly haven't talked to anybody 
who was on that committee that came up,

318
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,830
uh,
under Clinton,

319
00:14:39,831 --> 00:14:41,810
I believe.
Three million acres.

320
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:45,520
Three point three minutes.
Seems like a lot of Jesus.

321
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:47,510
Yeah,
sure.

322
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:50,330
Yeah.
Hr just means it started in the house.

323
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,440
Okay.
How's the representatives?

324
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:57,500
Hr,
and then a six slash 20 slash two.

325
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:59,150
So 6:20
ones off.

326
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:00,103
Right.

327
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:04,020
I pulled it after the backlash and his 
name is Jason Chaffetz.

328
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:05,120
Is that essays name?
Yep.

329
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,290
Representative Jason Chaffetz,
Utah.

330
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,320
And what's crazy is this guy's a hunter 
and a fisherman.

331
00:15:10,321 --> 00:15:13,110
And apparently he took a picture with 
him wearing Kambo.

332
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:13,790
Hey guys,
I'm going to.

333
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:14,623
You will come on and stop attacking me 
because as soon as people found out 

334
00:15:17,761 --> 00:15:21,450
about this bill,
his comments on his instagram page,

335
00:15:21,451 --> 00:15:26,340
we're just overwhelmed with hunters to 
just took over his instagram comments,

336
00:15:26,341 --> 00:15:27,174
you know,
and were really upset and some people 

337
00:15:28,921 --> 00:15:30,960
kept it classy.
A lot of people didn't.

338
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:34,980
And I'm sure he felt that.
The heat of that.

339
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,720
Yes,
absolutely.

340
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:41,040
Which is a really interesting like now 
because of social media because the guys

341
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,470
like you guys and I mean there was a 
million people.

342
00:15:43,471 --> 00:15:45,540
The Gritty Bowman Rinella.
Uh,

343
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:46,374
I got involved.
There's a lot of people involved and 

344
00:15:47,881 --> 00:15:49,180
there's a lot of different,
you know,

345
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:49,860
you look at all the.

346
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:50,693
If you calculate all our followers up of
all the different people that were 

347
00:15:53,431 --> 00:15:56,850
making posts about this,
it reaches a lot of people and then it,

348
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,013
it gets people who might've been like me
before I went with you guys to Montana 

349
00:16:01,351 --> 00:16:02,910
who just might have been curious.
Like,

350
00:16:02,911 --> 00:16:05,370
what is this all about?
Then you read into it and then you start

351
00:16:05,371 --> 00:16:06,204
looking into this public land system 
that we have and how unique and 

352
00:16:08,761 --> 00:16:10,110
beautiful it is.
And you just go,

353
00:16:10,111 --> 00:16:11,700
wow,
they want to sell that.

354
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:14,580
And Paul Ryan had proposed that as well,
right?

355
00:16:14,581 --> 00:16:16,590
Didn't he propose selling it off to pay 
some,

356
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,330
some of the land off to pay for the 
debt.

357
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:22,280
It's something that comes up all,
all too frequently because,

358
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:22,671
I mean,
it's,

359
00:16:22,671 --> 00:16:23,504
it's,
uh,

360
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,340
it's something that we've watched,
you know,

361
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,810
state by state,
by state.

362
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,880
Um,
do you know,

363
00:16:28,881 --> 00:16:29,714
it's like you get a bad fire season.
I'm all of a sudden you're up to your 

364
00:16:33,531 --> 00:16:38,120
eyeballs in debt and it's raised taxes 
or it's sell off some land,

365
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:39,730
sell off some land.
So short,

366
00:16:39,731 --> 00:16:40,910
shortsighted,
you know,

367
00:16:40,911 --> 00:16:44,580
when you think about the possibility 
that this land

368
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,570
could not be there for your children or 
your children's children.

369
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:50,330
Like it's been for us and it's been for 
our grandparents.

370
00:16:50,331 --> 00:16:52,610
I mean it says an amazing system that we
have here.

371
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:56,520
And what is her six slash 22 k?
So Hr six,

372
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:58,600
22 is

373
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:02,500
right now.
It is very black and white.

374
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:05,860
It's basically to remove,
um,

375
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:08,320
federal law enforcement officers,
Elios,

376
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:09,880
um,
which,

377
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:10,803
um,
the blm has its own law enforcement 

378
00:17:13,001 --> 00:17:14,270
officers.
Um,

379
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,870
forest service has its own law 
enforcement officers,

380
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,093
um,
remove those and then give county law 

381
00:17:20,711 --> 00:17:22,240
enforcement,
uh,

382
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:25,930
the authority to enforce laws on

383
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:29,570
the federally managed lands.
Huh.

384
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:32,690
So if their resources are tight,
which they are,

385
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:34,123
they probably wouldn't stop poachers.
They probably wouldn't do a good job of 

386
00:17:37,461 --> 00:17:39,610
keeping people of,
you know,

387
00:17:39,611 --> 00:17:41,190
making a mess out of the place.
Yes.

388
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:41,490
And

389
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:46,490
basically what it does is it sets the 
federal land system up to fail.

390
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,240
It's like a booby trap.
It's like,

391
00:17:48,241 --> 00:17:49,560
alright,
now we're going to pull,

392
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,520
you know,
all this,

393
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:53,520
all these resources out.
And then five years later it's like,

394
00:17:53,521 --> 00:17:54,810
oh,
look what a disaster it is.

395
00:17:54,811 --> 00:17:56,650
Now it's moving to state,
you know what I mean?

396
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:02,330
It's weakening the structure of it to 
facilitate a collapse.

397
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:02,860
Yes.

398
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:03,693
And there's nothing,
there's nothing against county law 

399
00:18:06,551 --> 00:18:09,040
enforcement here.
The thing is,

400
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:09,890
it's like,
you know,

401
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,970
you go grab your local sheriff or 
sheriff's deputy and say,

402
00:18:12,971 --> 00:18:14,410
Hey,
uh,

403
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,273
you know,
how many mushrooms can I pull off of 

404
00:18:16,331 --> 00:18:18,080
this burden on,
you know,

405
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,980
the siebler national forest.
I mean,

406
00:18:20,981 --> 00:18:22,360
that guy is going to look at you cross 
eyed,

407
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:23,650
you know,
uh,

408
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:24,483
ask them how many cords of wood you can 
go up and cut for your fireplace in the 

409
00:18:27,911 --> 00:18:28,940
winter.
You know,

410
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:31,150
the guy's not going to have a clue 
because it's not,

411
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:35,230
not as job.
Bigger fish to fry got totally different

412
00:18:35,231 --> 00:18:36,100
laws,
right?

413
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:38,870
From federal state for federal versus 
state and yeah,

414
00:18:38,871 --> 00:18:40,270
I mean it's a different job.

415
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:41,763
Now explain to people what is the 
difference between Blm and the other 

416
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:47,130
organizations that control

417
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:48,420
public land.
Okay.

418
00:18:48,421 --> 00:18:51,540
So beautiful in management.
Yeah.

419
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:55,320
So the homestead act or at a go west 
young man,

420
00:18:55,321 --> 00:18:58,230
everybody gets a 140 acres.
Um,

421
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,533
the uh,
so basically we got pushed a lot of 

422
00:19:03,121 --> 00:19:06,740
people out onto this big open space 
because uh,

423
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:08,550
you know,
the east needed money,

424
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:09,653
so you really need to populate these 
areas and start the economy rolling 

425
00:19:13,321 --> 00:19:14,820
again.
Um,

426
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,013
the basically that area's that failed 
like a large chunk of the Missouri 

427
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,024
breaks his block,
land management or bureau land 

428
00:19:23,161 --> 00:19:24,640
management.
Um,

429
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:29,750
the areas that failed and were not 
hospitable became blm ground.

430
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:35,850
And basically the impetus a blm is,
um,

431
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,133
they're,
they're more revenue focused then your 

432
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:45,150
forest service lands are so blm,
um,

433
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,240
is,
is more focused towards grazing.

434
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,690
Um,
so Lisa's like oil and gas grazing

435
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:55,280
and the grazing lease was the big thing 
with the bundys.

436
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:56,143
That was the big thing up in Oregon 
where there's a standoff with the 

437
00:19:59,601 --> 00:20:02,420
rangers and all that jazz,
which is fucking chaos

438
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:05,180
chaos.
But they owed a ton of money.

439
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,500
Yeah.
And they didn't,

440
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,730
you know,
didn't want to pay it.

441
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,470
They always a ton of money.

442
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:10,310
Yeah,
they still do.

443
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:13,400
But how does that work?
Because we've been on hunts before,

444
00:20:13,401 --> 00:20:15,980
like we were recently with Rinella and 
crew.

445
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:19,570
We're in Nevada and we're on a mule deer
hunt and you know,

446
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:22,670
you'd be stocking on a mule deer.
And these fucking cows were everywhere.

447
00:20:22,671 --> 00:20:25,490
I mean everywhere.
I mean if you were hunting cows,

448
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:27,830
boy you will be gold in like,
dude,

449
00:20:27,831 --> 00:20:30,380
we're eating good tonight.
And cows everywhere.

450
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:33,860
But we were hunting deer.
So you have to get away from the fucking

451
00:20:33,861 --> 00:20:37,070
cows to get to the deer and the cows 
that sometimes spook.

452
00:20:37,071 --> 00:20:37,904
And then the deer would realize that the
cow saw something and they would boil 

453
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,680
Boeing where the cows are going to come 
check you out.

454
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:46,010
He would step in cow shit everywhere.
And I was like,

455
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:47,920
this is so crazy.
How are these,

456
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,810
how does this work?
And you know,

457
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:53,020
they were trying to explain to me that 
these people just sort of let these cows

458
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,990
wander.
And we've found that in Montana as well.

459
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:56,883
Yup.
And we just let their cows wander all 

460
00:20:57,971 --> 00:20:59,440
over the place.
Then they round them up.

461
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:00,810
Yeah.
And that's something.

462
00:21:00,811 --> 00:21:02,720
So the,
you know,

463
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:05,550
we,
the people have,

464
00:21:05,551 --> 00:21:08,340
uh,
have these programs in place to where we

465
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,700
lease that ground.
Um,

466
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,480
I,
I would say more often than not,

467
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:20,690
if not a 100 percent of the time far 
below market value to uh,

468
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:22,733
you know,
the rancher and it's right of first 

469
00:21:23,731 --> 00:21:25,470
refusal.
So the first guy to say,

470
00:21:25,471 --> 00:21:26,304
hey,
I want to graze my cattle on this 

471
00:21:26,881 --> 00:21:27,714
property.
He's his name is going to be on the 

472
00:21:29,191 --> 00:21:33,160
lease until he doesn't want it anymore.
And it,

473
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:35,430
and it comes up for renewal.
And then,

474
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:36,420
um,
you know,

475
00:21:36,421 --> 00:21:40,060
there's a range land biologists,
um,

476
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:44,550
who go out and they say this is how many
days and how many,

477
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,830
um,
you know,

478
00:21:46,831 --> 00:21:48,420
animal cow,
calf units,

479
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:49,933
um,
can be grazed on this area for this 

480
00:21:53,101 --> 00:21:53,510
long.

481
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:55,940
And doesn't that affect local wildlife 
as well?

482
00:21:55,941 --> 00:21:59,330
Because I would assume if you're having 
your animals graze on the land,

483
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,193
they're eating a lot of stuff that the 
deer would eat or maybe a lot of the 

484
00:22:02,511 --> 00:22:03,344
other wildlife would eat.
But you gotta keep in mind Ma'am is a 

485
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,230
tough call.
I mean,

486
00:22:06,231 --> 00:22:06,600
yeah,

487
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,530
for we are,
you know,

488
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:09,300
the,
the low lands,

489
00:22:09,301 --> 00:22:10,134
it's the antelope and the and the uh,
and the antelope and the cows live 

490
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:16,050
pretty harmoniously.
In fact,

491
00:22:16,051 --> 00:22:17,020
a lot of that,
you know,

492
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:21,440
if there's a lot of grand day used to a 
lot of cow feed and you know,

493
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:24,520
it,
it could help when done properly it,

494
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,830
it works really well because,
you know,

495
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,750
basically our beef has replaced our 
bison or buffalo.

496
00:22:30,751 --> 00:22:35,190
So there was a major grazer out there 
prior to the beef being out there.

497
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:36,610
Um,
you know,

498
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:39,270
super dance grasslands are good for some
things.

499
00:22:39,271 --> 00:22:40,560
But,
you know,

500
00:22:40,561 --> 00:22:45,210
oftentimes your upland birds need open 
areas,

501
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,910
um,
uh,

502
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:47,783
for,
you know,

503
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:51,840
picking up scratch and it's better for 
the bugs and a number of reasons.

504
00:22:51,841 --> 00:22:55,740
So when that systems respected and done 
well,

505
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,060
um,
it's,

506
00:22:57,060 --> 00:23:00,120
it's good for everybody or it can be 
good for everybody.

507
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:01,510
Now,
what are your opinions that you,

508
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,353
I'm sure you guys are aware of this 
whole American Serengeti project that 

509
00:23:04,911 --> 00:23:05,744
they're trying to do in the midwest of 
this country or in the middle of this 

510
00:23:08,091 --> 00:23:10,220
country,
which is really quite fascinating.

511
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,353
They're trying to buy up private land 
and turn it into what they think was 

512
00:23:16,821 --> 00:23:20,690
essentially like what America was before
people came here.

513
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,150
Yes.
And I am not,

514
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,980
I'm not super studied up on it,
but yeah,

515
00:23:23,981 --> 00:23:25,870
that is kind of the nuts and bolts of 
it.

516
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:29,380
And at the end of the day,
if it's going to be privately held,

517
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,270
and I,
I want to say nature concern,

518
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:34,220
American prairie reserve.
There it is right there.

519
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:39,050
This is a little piece on it that a 
jamie just pulled up,

520
00:23:39,051 --> 00:23:44,051
but they want to reintroduce bison like 
wild bison all through out areas.

521
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:46,880
Wyoming,
Montana,

522
00:23:46,881 --> 00:23:48,560
Wyoming is a bunch of different areas.
Right.

523
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:49,453
Where is it?

524
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:50,403
Yeah.
Ultimately it's bigger than just being 

525
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:55,030
talked about in a number of different 
states.

526
00:23:55,031 --> 00:23:57,970
But yeah,
I think it is kind of the traditional,

527
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,590
you know,
the um,

528
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:06,700
yeah,
the kind of the Oklahoma,

529
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:10,090
South Dakota,
North Dakota,

530
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:13,540
like the true prairie region there

531
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:17,460
where it used to be like giant herds of 
buffalo wandering through the land.

532
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:18,503
They want to recreate that and they're 
also gonna open up block management on 

533
00:24:21,331 --> 00:24:22,050
that.
Right.

534
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:22,883
So this is going to be an area like once
it gets established and once there's 

535
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,633
populations of animals there,
then people are going to be allowed to 

536
00:24:28,171 --> 00:24:29,010
hunt those animals.

537
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,610
Yeah.
And I mean if,

538
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,170
if that's the case,
that's great.

539
00:24:32,171 --> 00:24:34,360
Like I said,
I haven't been super studied up on it,

540
00:24:34,361 --> 00:24:36,670
but you know,
I mean I love the idea man.

541
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,530
I mean

542
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:38,363
translating,
you know that they're doing this and 

543
00:24:39,491 --> 00:24:40,324
buying a private land as right now being
used for whatever and they're going to 

544
00:24:43,811 --> 00:24:46,620
turn it into public land and they're 
going to allow people to,

545
00:24:46,621 --> 00:24:47,201
uh,
to go.

546
00:24:47,201 --> 00:24:48,034
Then you're going to be able to see like
great herds of bison roaming through 

547
00:24:51,341 --> 00:24:52,480
some of these states.
I mean that.

548
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:53,343
That's going to be incredible and that's
something we always talk about on this 

549
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,960
land transfer stuff.
You know,

550
00:24:57,961 --> 00:24:59,170
once it's gone,
it's gone.

551
00:24:59,171 --> 00:25:01,510
So if these guys are out there trying to
make some more of it.

552
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:03,610
Yeah,
I say good on them.

553
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,610
They literally are trying to make more 
public land,

554
00:25:06,611 --> 00:25:08,900
which is kinda crazy.
What are you going to do about Predator?

555
00:25:08,901 --> 00:25:09,734
So they're going to bring in predators.
So they're going to bring in wolves and 

556
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:13,630
man,
if they're going to say that Jim,

557
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,353
here we go.

558
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:16,383
Does the APR at 10?
Intend to reintroduce predators such as 

559
00:25:19,181 --> 00:25:20,110
wolves.
Grizzly bears,

560
00:25:20,111 --> 00:25:23,260
which are historically present in the 
region as a non.

561
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:24,223
As a private nonprofit organization,
American prairie reserve does not have 

562
00:25:27,101 --> 00:25:27,934
the authority to reintroduce species to 
the area even at those species were 

563
00:25:30,941 --> 00:25:31,774
historically present.
Species reintroduction falls under the 

564
00:25:34,031 --> 00:25:34,864
jurisdiction of Montana fish and 
wildlife parks and slash or the US fish 

565
00:25:37,961 --> 00:25:38,794
and wildlife service in any decisions 
regarding the reintroduction of wolves 

566
00:25:41,201 --> 00:25:42,034
or grizzlies in the region will need to 
be made by these agencies augmented by 

567
00:25:45,821 --> 00:25:48,210
the will of the general public.
Interesting.

568
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,910
Yeah.
We're reintroducing grizzlies have tubs.

569
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:54,420
Xcel people like going for it though.
Oh,

570
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:55,700
I'd Montana.
It's crazy,

571
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:56,573
right?
An area that you and I were in Missouri 

572
00:25:58,231 --> 00:25:59,290
breaks.
I mean,

573
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:01,500
that's east of the mountains,
right?

574
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:02,500
Right.
Um,

575
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:07,630
they every other year,
so they catch some loaner.

576
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:13,130
Typically a young male is way out in the
prairie and it just looks like he's just

577
00:26:14,941 --> 00:26:17,670
kind of naturally getting funneled down 
in the Missouri breaks,

578
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:18,810
which,
you know,

579
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:21,810
as historic range for them.
And uh,

580
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:25,050
somewhere along the way he'd gets his 
hunger,

581
00:26:25,051 --> 00:26:28,800
gets the best of them and he knocks over
some sheep and that's kind of the end of

582
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,860
them.
But the same thing,

583
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,820
wolves are going to come whether you 
like it or not.

584
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,750
Yeah.
How do you guys feel about wolves?

585
00:26:34,751 --> 00:26:35,584
Because you guys are in Idaho and Idaho 
has a really interesting relationship 

586
00:26:38,141 --> 00:26:40,840
with wolves,
whereas a real love hate relationship,

587
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:44,970
like I gotta imagine it's to be cool as 
fuck to be out at night here.

588
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:49,860
Interesting sets.
Amazing.

589
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,753
So at first hairstyle banks or was it 
before you could hunt wolves and before 

590
00:26:55,441 --> 00:26:58,880
that was it was totally unchecked.
It it.

591
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:00,000
The elk hunting sucked

592
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,053
as they killed all the up because they 
came in and didn't know what was going 

593
00:27:03,161 --> 00:27:03,994
on.
They hadn't had wolves there in a long 

594
00:27:05,671 --> 00:27:06,504
time.
Over 100 years and then explain to 

595
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:08,584
people that there's a reintroduction of 
wolves into the yellowstone region in 

596
00:27:10,961 --> 00:27:12,820
1990 something or nothing.

597
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,680
Maybe it was.
I'm not positive when it started,

598
00:27:16,681 --> 00:27:17,350
but then

599
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:18,183
voted on either.
This is a really controversial subject 

600
00:27:19,901 --> 00:27:20,734
tomorrow,
sportspeople and also among wildlife 

601
00:27:22,481 --> 00:27:23,314
people.
A lot of wildlife people completely 

602
00:27:24,041 --> 00:27:26,410
support it.
They think it balances out the ecosystem

603
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:27,244
and that the undulates,
like the elk and the deer were running 

604
00:27:29,321 --> 00:27:34,000
rampant and they were destroying a lot 
of the grasses and the plants that would

605
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,750
like provide homes for a lot of other 
animals.

606
00:27:37,751 --> 00:27:39,910
And this whole thing was kind of 
unbalanced,

607
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:43,890
just like with beef man overgrazing bat.
Absolutely,

608
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,000
but are so,
you know,

609
00:27:46,001 --> 00:27:48,680
prior to us being able to hunt them and 
stuff,

610
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:51,030
it was,
it,

611
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:55,090
it really was skewed.
I had no idea how to deal with the wolf.

612
00:27:55,091 --> 00:27:58,110
So for instance,
a pack of wolves would come in the bowl,

613
00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:03,150
a bowl would go out and try to fend off 
the wolves and it would just get crushed

614
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:05,020
by the wolves.
So,

615
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,700
you know,
a bull elk,

616
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:07,943
anything.
Yeah.

617
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:08,870
Full boil.
Right?

618
00:28:08,871 --> 00:28:09,704
Right.
But now a days after maybe living 

619
00:28:12,221 --> 00:28:13,630
together for.
I mean,

620
00:28:13,631 --> 00:28:16,150
I've seen this,
it's my happening in my neighborhood,

621
00:28:16,151 --> 00:28:16,984
like as we speak,
there's wolves in my neighborhood right 

622
00:28:18,521 --> 00:28:20,860
now.
And it literally,

623
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,380
you can tell when the wolves around the 
elk,

624
00:28:23,381 --> 00:28:25,870
they pot up kind of,
um,

625
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:29,770
kind of get into a circle and they don't
try to go out and fight one on one.

626
00:28:29,771 --> 00:28:30,604
They'll just sit there and the wolves 
will kind of come in and they work 

627
00:28:33,671 --> 00:28:34,504
together.
It,

628
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:35,350
you know,
and,

629
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:36,640
and it's,
it's an interesting,

630
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,680
it's an interesting rl cuttings.
Quite good.

631
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,570
And it,
and the elk don't run,

632
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:42,580
don't run.
They don't split off.

633
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,920
They've kind of figured out this 
symbiosis,

634
00:28:44,921 --> 00:28:47,230
like how to live with wolves.
It's,

635
00:28:47,231 --> 00:28:49,060
it's an interesting thing that's 
fascinating

636
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:50,630
because they always did live with 
wolves,

637
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:52,700
you know,
until people came along and.

638
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:55,310
Well in Elvis tradition,
elves,

639
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:59,630
what am I talking about?
This is where my mind is elk.

640
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,150
Traditionally,
before people came around,

641
00:29:02,151 --> 00:29:05,210
there's a debate as to whether or not 
they were mountain animals at all.

642
00:29:05,211 --> 00:29:07,040
Right?
They were probably spent more time

643
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:12,340
store starved going through the Nez 
perce territory,

644
00:29:12,341 --> 00:29:13,250
right?
Like they,

645
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,810
there are so little game in the 
mountains when they were out there.

646
00:29:16,811 --> 00:29:19,330
That's one of the major arguments for 
that.

647
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,340
But um,
yeah,

648
00:29:21,341 --> 00:29:22,330
you know,
there's,

649
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:26,590
there were animals covering the prairies
if,

650
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,120
if you believe everywhere to those 
lyrics,

651
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:31,040
Lewis and Clark,

652
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,690
what kind of makes sense if you think 
about it,

653
00:29:32,691 --> 00:29:33,524
because if you see the way they're 
adapting to wolves and every animal 

654
00:29:35,721 --> 00:29:38,540
adapts.
I mean there's a crazy documentary right

655
00:29:38,541 --> 00:29:40,130
now.
I mean this is a little bit off topic,

656
00:29:40,131 --> 00:29:41,950
but on Netflix rats,

657
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:45,640
it is so fucking disturbing if you 
haven't seen it,

658
00:29:45,641 --> 00:29:46,990
it's amazing.
It's called,

659
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:49,600
it's called rat.
I've heard about Morgan spurlock,

660
00:29:49,601 --> 00:29:53,680
the guy who did supersize,
me and a bunch of other documentaries.

661
00:29:53,681 --> 00:29:58,090
He created this woo rats,
like their gross.

662
00:29:58,091 --> 00:29:59,230
Everybody knows her gross,
you know,

663
00:29:59,231 --> 00:30:00,064
just when they start pulling Paris,
I did catch a bunch of rats start 

664
00:30:03,191 --> 00:30:04,024
polling parasites out and I'm like,
well this one will kill you if you have 

665
00:30:05,501 --> 00:30:07,630
an open wound and this gets on you.
You're black.

666
00:30:07,631 --> 00:30:08,464
Plague comes from Ras.
And they pulled a bot fly out of this 

667
00:30:11,831 --> 00:30:13,810
one rad that was literally the size of 
its head.

668
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:17,350
It's just this gigantic thing.
And then at the end of it,

669
00:30:17,351 --> 00:30:18,184
they kind of explained like one of the 
guys who's an exterminator explains how 

670
00:30:21,221 --> 00:30:22,054
smart rats on how much they adapt and 
what they'll do is if there's poison or 

671
00:30:26,531 --> 00:30:27,430
if there's traps.

672
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,473
They literally the smart rats,
the older rats will hang back and 

673
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:31,954
they'll let a young,
weaker rat go towards the food and you 

674
00:30:35,051 --> 00:30:35,460
know,
he,

675
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:38,140
he gets his fucking head crushed by the 
trap and they go,

676
00:30:38,141 --> 00:30:38,974
Yep,
I thought something was fucked up about 

677
00:30:39,941 --> 00:30:40,930
that.
Let's get outta here.

678
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:44,290
And in the union never killed them.
All like to be able to kill them all.

679
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:48,340
The most effective method that they were
using this documentary was dogs.

680
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:49,563
They had a bunch of terriers.
It was all these little cute little 

681
00:30:53,531 --> 00:30:54,364
dogs,
man,

682
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:56,200
little cute little dogs.
He would think,

683
00:30:56,201 --> 00:30:57,070
oh,
a little sweetie.

684
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:59,200
Those little fucking Jack Russell 
terriers,

685
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:02,560
those little suckers were meant to kill 
rats.

686
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:03,423
That's why they made them.
And they just run after these rats and 

687
00:31:06,101 --> 00:31:09,670
they're all ripping them apart.
He was ruthless and brutal,

688
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:10,923
but it just highlights the adaptation 
that animals undergo when there's 

689
00:31:15,971 --> 00:31:16,804
pressure,
any kind of pressure makes them adapt 

690
00:31:19,121 --> 00:31:22,420
and change and they just sort of figure 
out what the fuck the problem is.

691
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:23,940
The Grand Canyon on the way.

692
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:27,320
I grabbed a.
There it is.

693
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,620
This is a scene in it.
Oh,

694
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:31,090
there we go.
Look at those things.

695
00:31:31,091 --> 00:31:32,500
Your pith.
Oh my God.

696
00:31:32,501 --> 00:31:34,450
These little fuckers are monsters,
man.

697
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:35,613
They just crushed these rats and they 
rip them apart like they played tug of 

698
00:31:38,471 --> 00:31:40,360
war with these rats.
It is.

699
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:42,580
This is a,
this is not in the movie,

700
00:31:42,581 --> 00:31:43,870
right?
This is just something else.

701
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:46,660
Just on youtube called riding or riding.
Yeah.

702
00:31:46,661 --> 00:31:47,494
And this is how they read the 
countrysides of rats and like really 

703
00:31:50,501 --> 00:31:51,840
heavy area.
They don't eat them though.

704
00:31:51,841 --> 00:31:52,674
They just crush them.
Well sometimes they eat them in the 

705
00:31:54,281 --> 00:31:55,600
movie.
They were eating some of them.

706
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:56,530
Speaking to the

707
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,640
parasite side of things.
Kevin and I were cruising down.

708
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,940
Uh,
where were you last night?

709
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,720
See the Kardashians?
Ventura Boulevard?

710
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:07,740
No,
there is a possum.

711
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:11,540
Cal grabbed positive by the tail.
I thought it might have been.

712
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:16,350
I couldn't help myself as possible.
I've ever seen a good idea at the time.

713
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:19,050
I've never seen a possum before.
I've never seen a boss.

714
00:32:19,051 --> 00:32:21,390
How's that possible?
You're in the woods 300 days a year.

715
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,910
Awesome man.
Wow.

716
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:24,773
Yeah,
so I grabbed the thing by the tail and 

717
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:27,720
because I wanted to see if it played 
dad.

718
00:32:27,721 --> 00:32:28,240
Right,
right.

719
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,073
The thing,
and then immediately I just ran inside 

720
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:32,940
wash my hands because I.
Oh yeah,

721
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,660
I'm in La and I grabbed a pause,
pause guides for sure.

722
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:40,050
It's kind of AIDS.
So the adaptation is a

723
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:43,040
hundred percent true.
Those elk,

724
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:43,933
God punished when the wolves were coming
on the scene and they just figured it 

725
00:32:48,501 --> 00:32:49,334
out and figured out that they got 
punished by people and they moved into 

726
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:53,630
the mountains.
They realize,

727
00:32:53,631 --> 00:32:54,890
look,
these people though,

728
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:55,743
the lazy ones,
they want to pull up in their truck and 

729
00:32:56,751 --> 00:32:59,810
fucking shoot off the hood and just stay
away from cars.

730
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,680
Let's.
Hey guys,

731
00:33:00,681 --> 00:33:03,440
let's go up here.
That's hard for them to go up here.

732
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:06,350
They get tired is not that much air.
Let's go higher.

733
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:09,840
The wolves are super smart.
They don't mess around,

734
00:33:09,841 --> 00:33:12,840
like if once the bullets started flying 
they would,

735
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:13,883
you know,
they were,

736
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,600
you know,
you know,

737
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,900
there's a wolf quota and rarely in our 
unit does it get met,

738
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:19,950
you know,
so it's

739
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,650
explain that to people that are the 
uninitiated.

740
00:33:22,651 --> 00:33:26,340
So what it is is the wildlife biologist,
and this is a really controversial topic

741
00:33:26,341 --> 00:33:27,174
because when they reintroduced wolves,
there was a target population they 

742
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:33,510
wanted to reach and they felt like we 
could reintroduce these wolves.

743
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:34,344
And what's interesting is they got them 
from Canada and the guy that trapped 

744
00:33:36,721 --> 00:33:39,870
them that the legend holds,
he just found the nastiest,

745
00:33:39,871 --> 00:33:40,980
biggest like,
oh,

746
00:33:40,981 --> 00:33:42,720
you guys want to bring waltz?
Because in Canada,

747
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:45,780
like where,
where I got this Moose in BC,

748
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:48,930
they have so many wolves that Mike Hawk 
Ridge,

749
00:33:48,931 --> 00:33:50,820
my buddy lives up there,
one of his neighbors,

750
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:54,010
they took out a cow and you know,
they,

751
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:54,893
they'll just get these big packs and 
they'll just fucking attack things and 

752
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,060
roll in it.

753
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:03,060
At least for that.
A pack of four small nine of them and.

754
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:06,250
But at one,
I'm not like some Wolf Hater,

755
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:06,701
right?
No,

756
00:34:06,701 --> 00:34:07,120
no,
no.

757
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,520
By any means,
but it's,

758
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:11,830
it is.
They are gnarly predators,

759
00:34:11,831 --> 00:34:13,570
like I've seen them,
you know,

760
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:16,470
kill stuff and it's,
I don't know,

761
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:19,680
it's interesting to me how people have 
this real soft spot for wolves.

762
00:34:19,681 --> 00:34:23,140
Like they're amazing creatures and they 
can do amazing things.

763
00:34:23,141 --> 00:34:27,460
They can travel amazing distances but 
nice they are not and it's not like this

764
00:34:27,461 --> 00:34:30,040
furry kind of thing.
They're pissed.

765
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:30,963
Well,
people think of them as dogs because 

766
00:34:31,991 --> 00:34:32,824
they look a lot like huskies that we 
think of them as some beautiful forest 

767
00:34:35,231 --> 00:34:37,840
creature that lives this natural 
existence and they do,

768
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:43,170
but they're also fucking ruthless 
predators and they are the only Predator

769
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:47,200
in North America like that,
that size that operates in packs.

770
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,210
And that's some scary shit,
man.

771
00:34:49,211 --> 00:34:50,044
Coyotes kind of do it,
but there are a lot smaller and you 

772
00:34:51,871 --> 00:34:52,680
know,
they're,

773
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:56,680
they're more going after rodents and 
Fonz and little things that they can get

774
00:34:56,681 --> 00:34:57,514
ahold of.
Wolves will take out a fucking full 

775
00:34:58,481 --> 00:35:02,560
blown elk.
You've come across it kill and it's that

776
00:35:02,561 --> 00:35:06,080
thing did not die in any sort of a nice 
disney sort of way.

777
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:10,870
Boy and amaze back to the front when we 
were in,

778
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,073
um,
bc in that place where I was getting to 

779
00:35:14,621 --> 00:35:18,390
with my friend Mike Hockridge up there.
We came across a kill.

780
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:19,780
It was pretty fresh.
It was a,

781
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:21,910
a calf,
a moose calf,

782
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:25,030
and it was just the,
what were the stunning thing about it is

783
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:26,410
first of all,
it's pretty fresh.

784
00:35:26,411 --> 00:35:27,244
Like you look down at it.
Like it probably happened the night 

785
00:35:28,601 --> 00:35:31,360
before maybe at the very earliest,
like a day ago.

786
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:35,200
And it was fucking hair everywhere.
Like that's what I didn't expect somehow

787
00:35:35,201 --> 00:35:36,670
or another I thought like,
like,

788
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:38,730
oh,
I didn't expect to see so much hair,

789
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:42,990
but it's like almost like they shaved it
and it stays for like a long time.

790
00:35:42,991 --> 00:35:43,824
You know,
you could come in the next summer and 

791
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:49,230
it'll be this big,
looked like a carpet well up there in BC

792
00:35:49,231 --> 00:35:51,960
where he lives,
you can shoot as many walls as you want.

793
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:52,823
There's no quota.
The reason beings that there's so many 

794
00:35:54,541 --> 00:35:55,374
of them,
they have to control the population and 

795
00:35:56,401 --> 00:35:57,840
they're so fucking smart.

796
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,033
They're really hard to kill.
And so these people that have cows up 

797
00:36:02,281 --> 00:36:04,860
there and their various farm animals up 
there,

798
00:36:04,861 --> 00:36:06,300
I mean they're constantly under 
pressure,

799
00:36:06,301 --> 00:36:07,680
the constantly the threat of these 
wolves.

800
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:09,023
And as well as him,
Mike shot a wolf that came at him and 

801
00:36:11,791 --> 00:36:12,624
jumped at him off of a ridge.
He was going up a ridge rifle in his 

802
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:20,450
hand and he had made some howls,
you know,

803
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:22,140
he,
he can imitate a wolf's howl.

804
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:27,290
And the wolf saw him and literally was 
jumping at him and he shot it in the air

805
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:31,050
that has asked me using whole Africa 
style.

806
00:36:31,051 --> 00:36:31,884
Right?
He's got this wolf mounted in his house 

807
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:37,140
like this with his feet up to remind him
of that scene.

808
00:36:37,141 --> 00:36:37,974
I mean,
that easily could have been the end of 

809
00:36:38,521 --> 00:36:38,990
him.
I mean,

810
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:40,920
he's up there without a,
without a gun.

811
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:44,450
That wolf could kill the teamwork 
aspect.

812
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,600
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

813
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,430
Oh yeah.
That would be horrific.

814
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:47,870
They're worse.

815
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:51,170
So we called in a wolf.
So yeah,

816
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:53,960
we should go back to like the quota 
thing,

817
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:55,250
because this is kind of a pet peeve of 
mine.

818
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,353
People look,
I try to encourage everybody at the 

819
00:36:59,361 --> 00:37:00,194
office to go to our local fish and game 
meetings and the town hall meetings and 

820
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:10,150
things that happened there in Ketchum 
Idaho and I'm the,

821
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,160
one of the arguments that came up was 
just so backwards,

822
00:37:14,161 --> 00:37:18,690
but it came from a place of.
I can see the logical sequence here,

823
00:37:18,691 --> 00:37:23,040
but typically if there's a really,
really long hunting season on something,

824
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:28,440
it means that hunters are doing a really
bad job of filling their tags.

825
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:29,483
Right.
Okay.

826
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:30,683
So if there's a really short season,
it typically means that hunters are 

827
00:37:34,081 --> 00:37:37,230
doing a really efficient job of filling 
their tags.

828
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,513
So we have this very long season on 
wolves and several people from town 

829
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,550
stood up the fish and game meeting and 
said,

830
00:37:47,551 --> 00:37:50,340
hey,
this is just immoral that,

831
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:51,683
you know,
we were putting hunting pressure on 

832
00:37:52,741 --> 00:37:54,360
wolves for eight months out of the year.

833
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:59,990
And the truth of the matter is,
is hunters,

834
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:02,270
myself included,
are doing a very,

835
00:38:02,271 --> 00:38:06,050
very poor job of putting a tag on these 
things.

836
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:07,183
And I've,
I've called him one in our area and it 

837
00:38:09,771 --> 00:38:13,550
was an absolutely amazing experience.
But uh,

838
00:38:13,551 --> 00:38:14,384
you know,
basically are south facing slopes are 

839
00:38:15,801 --> 00:38:16,634
wide open or north facing slopes are 
heavily timbered and I could hear the 

840
00:38:20,751 --> 00:38:23,510
wolf calling below my,
a friend of mine,

841
00:38:23,511 --> 00:38:28,490
Jim is an amazing shot,
a old retired forest service dude.

842
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:33,050
And he got set up for the shot.
I'm calling it the wolf.

843
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:34,123
As the wolf's coming up the mountain all
the sudden starts making noises that I 

844
00:38:37,151 --> 00:38:39,670
just cannot make.
So I kinda knew I was screwed.

845
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,593
Right.
But it was the vocal range is 

846
00:38:42,581 --> 00:38:43,414
unbelievable.
I would look just like barks and woofs 

847
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:49,780
like Wolf's growls.
Like it just sounded like this thing was

848
00:38:49,781 --> 00:38:53,020
getting more and more pissed off.
The closer it got to us.

849
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:55,450
And that was my job,
right?

850
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,313
I was like,
I'm going to make this thing so pissed 

851
00:38:57,550 --> 00:39:00,820
that it just keeps coming and Jim's 
going to get a shot at it.

852
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:05,920
And that thing broke the tree line 
probably 500 yards,

853
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:07,203
made it at a dead sprint,
about 60 yards from the timber all the 

854
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:13,390
sudden hit the brakes,
turned around was gone.

855
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,950
And that is the closest I've ever gotten
to killing a wolf.

856
00:39:16,951 --> 00:39:20,620
And Idaho.
And sought for maybe a second.

857
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:21,933
Now

858
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:23,530
there's a lot of people that are 
listening to this go,

859
00:39:23,531 --> 00:39:25,690
why the fuck would you want to kill a 
wolf man?

860
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:27,190
You know what do you go to?
Little Duke.

861
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:28,770
Duke doesn't work.
You know that law?

862
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:31,140
That's a big one always comes up is your
Dick's small man.

863
00:39:31,141 --> 00:39:34,960
You want to kill a wolf?
What I think is lost on people who don't

864
00:39:34,961 --> 00:39:35,794
encounter walls or who don't understand 
the science behind wildlife management 

865
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:45,330
is that there is nothing else that's 
going to control their population.

866
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:46,773
It's only going to be people.
They're going to survive through the 

867
00:39:49,211 --> 00:39:51,940
winter and they're going to eat as many 
elk as they can,

868
00:39:51,941 --> 00:39:52,774
as many deers,
many whatever the fuck they can get 

869
00:39:53,831 --> 00:39:57,250
ahold of as they can.
And especially since they have this kind

870
00:39:57,251 --> 00:40:01,330
of crazy headstart before the animals 
figured out that they were there because

871
00:40:01,331 --> 00:40:02,164
they'd never been there.
And over 100 years since they were 

872
00:40:03,671 --> 00:40:07,120
extricated from the American southwest 
and the,

873
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,760
you know,
what they had done was with wolves.

874
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:12,570
They had shot like horses,
like wild horses.

875
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:14,190
Then injected them with strychnine.
Right?

876
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:19,360
And then they had shot like an Alpha 
wolf and rubbed his scent and his glands

877
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:23,590
all over the meat so that the other 
wolves knew that he had been there.

878
00:40:23,591 --> 00:40:25,180
So they thought it was okay to eat that 
stuff.

879
00:40:25,181 --> 00:40:26,014
And so they would eat it.
They would get the strict nine and they 

880
00:40:27,671 --> 00:40:28,480
would die.
And they,

881
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,070
it was a mass kill off this wolf.
Yeah.

882
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,200
Yeah.
Judas Wolf.

883
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:32,650
Yeah.

884
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:35,720
Yeah.
Yes.

885
00:40:35,721 --> 00:40:37,760
So yeah,
there is management,

886
00:40:37,761 --> 00:40:39,440
right.
And the thing is like,

887
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:42,570
one of the hottest topics in our area 
was um,

888
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:45,290
in the winter,
especially a heavy winter right now,

889
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:48,920
all your game animals get congregated in
lower elevations,

890
00:40:48,921 --> 00:40:49,754
typically on these south facing slopes 
and get a lot of sun heavy winters like 

891
00:40:53,811 --> 00:40:54,644
we're experiencing right now.
These animals are basically pushed into 

892
00:40:57,831 --> 00:40:58,664
that farm and ranch country.
And those operators down there are 

893
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:05,083
feeding their winter livestock and the 
wolves and the coyotes are writing on 

894
00:41:12,321 --> 00:41:14,600
top everybody in calving seasons right 
now.

895
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,020
So then you get a,
typically a very large,

896
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:20,230
um,
did rate.

897
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:21,613
Yeah.
Mortality rates by spikes because you 

898
00:41:23,071 --> 00:41:25,340
got animals that are in distress and 
there's,

899
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:26,413
you know,
after birth from the birthing process 

900
00:41:27,861 --> 00:41:32,861
everywhere you got easy pickins on the 
cabs and a hunters aren't knocking these

901
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,830
down.
So the state and you know,

902
00:41:36,831 --> 00:41:37,664
like a cattleman's association,
we'll go together and fun helicopter 

903
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:42,283
gunning.
So Ariel gunning to go out there and 

904
00:41:43,551 --> 00:41:44,720
shoot those animals.
So,

905
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:47,050
um,
you know,

906
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:48,730
uh,
I,

907
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:50,690
I would love to hear the tiny dick 
argument.

908
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:51,680
Um,

909
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,620
well,
he goes,

910
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:55,670
go a tiny dude.
Why would you want to kill a wolf there?

911
00:41:55,671 --> 00:41:57,320
Beautiful,
magnificent creatures.

912
00:41:57,670 --> 00:41:58,503
And they are.
But it's important to recognize that 

913
00:42:00,311 --> 00:42:03,400
there have historically been gigantic 
problems with wolves and people.

914
00:42:03,401 --> 00:42:07,210
That's where all the Little Red Riding 
Hood Shit comes from the wolves in Paris

915
00:42:07,211 --> 00:42:09,010
story.
I'm sure you're aware of that story from

916
00:42:09,011 --> 00:42:11,980
the 14 hundreds where they killed like 
40 people in Paris.

917
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,550
That Paris has wolves in it again.
Do you know that?

918
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:17,560
No.
Yes,

919
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:19,180
they're,
the people are being told.

920
00:42:19,181 --> 00:42:20,014
There was an article about it recently 
where people are being told to not fear 

921
00:42:22,301 --> 00:42:23,134
the wolves that are in the streets of 
fucking Paris because they're only 

922
00:42:26,261 --> 00:42:29,740
looking for four legged.
Pray like these fucking people.

923
00:42:29,741 --> 00:42:32,320
Don't remember this story from the 14 
hundreds,

924
00:42:32,321 --> 00:42:33,154
this historical story where the people 
of Paris had to gather together with 

925
00:42:36,461 --> 00:42:40,870
fucking spears and quarter these wolves 
and killed them in a town square.

926
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:42,320
It's an amazing story.
Now.

927
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:43,390
How much of it,
you know,

928
00:42:43,391 --> 00:42:45,420
obviously when you're dealing with 
something from 1400,

929
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:46,263
there's no film,
so we don't know how much of this is 

930
00:42:48,491 --> 00:42:49,324
accurate,
but it's a historical story that they 

931
00:42:51,611 --> 00:42:55,750
had to kill a ton of wolves and I'm sure
you guys know about the story from World

932
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:56,583
War One.
The Russians and the Germans had a 

933
00:42:58,190 --> 00:43:01,660
ceasefire because so many of them were 
getting killed by wolves in Russia.

934
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:03,810
They decided,
let's go kill these fucking wolves.

935
00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:05,020
Then we'll go back to killing each 
other.

936
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,580
I had never heard that.
He never heard.

937
00:43:06,610 --> 00:43:08,620
It's a great story.
It's a great story.

938
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:09,653
I think.

939
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:11,970
I mean the populous at large,
what they,

940
00:43:11,971 --> 00:43:12,804
I think will benefit the most from it.
There's people on extreme lovers and 

941
00:43:16,831 --> 00:43:17,664
extreme haters,
but in the middle there is somewhere in 

942
00:43:20,251 --> 00:43:21,084
the middle there's a right thing to do 
and I think that the government 

943
00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:24,683
definitely puts their best foot forward,
the scientists and whatever to figure 

944
00:43:29,281 --> 00:43:31,230
out that balance,
you know,

945
00:43:31,231 --> 00:43:33,840
and I think that to say that,
you know,

946
00:43:33,841 --> 00:43:35,580
we need to have,
you know,

947
00:43:35,730 --> 00:43:36,563
10,000
wolves in Idaho is naive because that 

948
00:43:38,521 --> 00:43:40,080
would happen for,
for instance,

949
00:43:40,081 --> 00:43:43,980
if they were just let you know,
for procreate at will.

950
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:48,390
So you know,
these people are trying to be good,

951
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:49,550
right?
That's the,

952
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:50,483
that's why they're calling them.
That's why you know that that's why 

953
00:43:52,981 --> 00:43:54,600
they're reintroduced him to create a 
balance,

954
00:43:54,601 --> 00:43:56,040
you know?
And I think that that's,

955
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,090
that needs to be realized both sides.
Oh sorry,

956
00:43:58,300 --> 00:43:59,133
both sides.
People that don't want any wolves to 

957
00:44:00,611 --> 00:44:01,444
die,
they don't want Wolf's die because 

958
00:44:02,231 --> 00:44:04,480
wolves are amazing.
And then wildlife is amazing.

959
00:44:04,481 --> 00:44:05,560
It's totally.
Well,

960
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:06,403
you can go to yellowstone and I went to 
summer and you'd go and see a herd of 

961
00:44:09,671 --> 00:44:11,640
buffalo just chilling on this field,
like,

962
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:12,743
you know,
and I was there with my kids and I was 

963
00:44:13,781 --> 00:44:15,610
giving him,
the buyer knows they're staring at these

964
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:17,860
buffalo and they're only like 100 yards 
away and I'm like,

965
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:19,670
this is amazing.
[inaudible] like,

966
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:21,850
and my kids were like,
those are wild.

967
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:22,870
I'm like,
those are wild.

968
00:44:22,871 --> 00:44:25,720
They go wherever they want and like 
that's like in their head,

969
00:44:25,721 --> 00:44:27,610
like that's a wild.
That does just giant,

970
00:44:27,611 --> 00:44:31,890
furry fucking star wars beast.
It's a wild ever forget it.

971
00:44:31,950 --> 00:44:33,210
They'll never forget it.
Yeah.

972
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:35,250
Do you mean it was sinking in their head
to the,

973
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:36,790
this is wild,
you know,

974
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:39,720
because it's one thing if you see 
something behind a fence and you go,

975
00:44:39,721 --> 00:44:40,740
oh,
that's a cow.

976
00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:41,910
You know,
we're at a farm,

977
00:44:41,911 --> 00:44:43,260
that's a cow.
And I'm like,

978
00:44:43,261 --> 00:44:44,910
no honey.
Those things live in the woods.

979
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:46,650
They go wherever they want.
There's no boss,

980
00:44:46,651 --> 00:44:49,080
no one tells them what to do.
They just do whatever they want.

981
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:49,641
Totally.
Well,

982
00:44:49,641 --> 00:44:53,300
coming full circle,
like the whole wild thing is that,

983
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:54,733
you know,
with public lands people get to have 

984
00:44:56,421 --> 00:44:57,254
these crazy wild experiences.
I e by hunting like there's very little 

985
00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:04,580
things that you can do where you go out 
and it's,

986
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:06,560
it's raw,
right?

987
00:45:06,561 --> 00:45:10,280
Things can go sideways and you know,
you can get caught out that I'm in.

988
00:45:10,281 --> 00:45:10,940
It's,
it's,

989
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:13,340
it's,
it's a unique thing to be able to do,

990
00:45:13,341 --> 00:45:15,740
to see these experience,
this wild stuff

991
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:19,940
mean by get caught out there.
It's like you could go somewhere and the

992
00:45:19,941 --> 00:45:22,510
weather can turn ugly and you can get 
snowed in,

993
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,140
get lost in the fucking mountains.
Yeah.

994
00:45:24,141 --> 00:45:29,000
People die every day.
Bob a Bobcat goldthwait had a really fun

995
00:45:29,001 --> 00:45:31,850
video,
a movie rather than he did called Willow

996
00:45:31,850 --> 00:45:32,860
Creek about and the,
the,

997
00:45:32,861 --> 00:45:33,694
the,
the movie was about all the different 

998
00:45:34,701 --> 00:45:35,534
people that get lost in the woods and 
his movie was saying that big foot was 

999
00:45:37,641 --> 00:45:38,710
eating them.
Right.

1000
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:42,600
Pretty ridiculous.
But there is it.

1001
00:45:42,930 --> 00:45:44,960
Your is it,
but it was fun.

1002
00:45:44,961 --> 00:45:46,450
But bobcat is a nut.
He's,

1003
00:45:46,490 --> 00:45:48,200
he's a big foot fanatic.
I was like,

1004
00:45:48,201 --> 00:45:50,900
I was trying to tell them from people 
that actually go to the woods,

1005
00:45:51,350 --> 00:45:53,210
you know,
many hunters see big foot zero,

1006
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:55,820
zero.
It's zero.

1007
00:45:55,850 --> 00:45:57,710
How many get hit by cars?
Zero.

1008
00:45:58,150 --> 00:46:01,070
Fucking zero.
How many get caught on trail cams?

1009
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:03,320
Fuckin zero and got.
That's the other thing.

1010
00:46:03,321 --> 00:46:04,154
Like with the,
the number of trail cams that exist 

1011
00:46:05,391 --> 00:46:06,224
today in the woods.
I put people put up to scout to try to 

1012
00:46:08,931 --> 00:46:11,300
find out where the animals are and then 
on top of that,

1013
00:46:11,301 --> 00:46:12,134
the number of phones that people have 
that have cameras on them has gone 

1014
00:46:14,001 --> 00:46:16,880
through the roof.
But the bigfoot sightings have shrunk.

1015
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:19,880
There's way less of them.
Interesting.

1016
00:46:20,170 --> 00:46:25,170
And you to my big foot and it was last 
time you saw a ufo video and fucking non

1017
00:46:27,810 --> 00:46:29,770
or non our area magic.

1018
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:32,570
He's gonna see a Ufo.
You could.

1019
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:36,300
We have zero light pollution.
Red The qualities.

1020
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:37,280
Insane.
Oh,

1021
00:46:37,281 --> 00:46:39,560
you guys must have like crazy skies at 
nine,

1022
00:46:39,590 --> 00:46:40,423
huh?

1023
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:46,200
Yeah.
You guys must have beautiful

1024
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,640
skies on rail.
So we're.

1025
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:49,533
I mean the office is just under 7,000
feet and then within 20 minutes of the 

1026
00:46:54,881 --> 00:46:59,170
office you can climb to 11,000
feet.

1027
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:00,790
Wow.
Try breathing up.

1028
00:47:00,791 --> 00:47:02,710
There is a.
it's difficult.

1029
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,840
Bring one of these kettlebells up there 
and get yourself a workout.

1030
00:47:04,930 --> 00:47:07,570
You feel good,
you feel good,

1031
00:47:07,571 --> 00:47:08,730
and then you have,
you know,

1032
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:09,573
a couple days worth of stuff on your 
back and your like your wife that you 

1033
00:47:13,361 --> 00:47:17,110
have to drink so much water.
When there's high altitude.

1034
00:47:17,111 --> 00:47:18,880
What's that about?
Just dry.

1035
00:47:19,450 --> 00:47:23,170
Generally speaking are we are just low 
humidity and deep breathe.

1036
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,033
You know,
every time you breathe out you breathe 

1037
00:47:25,781 --> 00:47:26,900
out a little water,
right?

1038
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:28,210
Yeah.
That's what the mist is.

1039
00:47:28,211 --> 00:47:30,010
When you see people at and it's cold

1040
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:31,570
and stuff that's coming out of your 
mouth,

1041
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:35,170
that's actually water vapor and it 
exists all the time.

1042
00:47:35,171 --> 00:47:38,800
You just don't see it because there's 
not a big difference in the temperature,

1043
00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:41,980
which means your body in the air like it
is when it's really cold out.

1044
00:47:42,090 --> 00:47:44,150
I think that's why people are more hung 
over the mountains.

1045
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,730
Certainly my excuse.
Yeah.

1046
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,690
Well I got to be because you're 
dehydrated too.

1047
00:47:49,691 --> 00:47:52,270
Which is the big factor in being hung 
over in the first place.

1048
00:47:52,271 --> 00:47:53,200
Right,
exactly.

1049
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:54,153
Like the people that are pros.
They'll pound booze and they'll have a 

1050
00:47:56,531 --> 00:47:57,364
fucking jug of water.
A buddy of mine drank with John Claude 

1051
00:48:00,190 --> 00:48:01,140
van Damme and he said,
uh,

1052
00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:05,080
this is like way back when John Claude 
van Damme was a big movie star doing all

1053
00:48:05,081 --> 00:48:05,914
these big movies.
He said he would do booze and he had a 

1054
00:48:08,381 --> 00:48:09,214
fucking gallon of water with him.
He brought like a milk jug size gallon 

1055
00:48:13,811 --> 00:48:14,560
filled with water.

1056
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:17,080
So you do a shot and fucking chug the 
water.

1057
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:22,440
Like it was really consciously Busan,
which I've never seen anybody do before.

1058
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:27,820
That's oozing.
That's a guy that's going,

1059
00:48:29,330 --> 00:48:30,163
look,
I'm not going to stop being a 

1060
00:48:30,461 --> 00:48:33,100
degenerate.
I'm going to take care of my body in the

1061
00:48:33,101 --> 00:48:33,934
process.
He comes to catch into years two and 

1062
00:48:35,471 --> 00:48:38,330
we'd hear stories about looseness,
but I don't,

1063
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,240
I've never witnessed it myself 
looseness,

1064
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,850
you know,
go into the bars and getting loose.

1065
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:44,620
Getting party in.
Yes.

1066
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:45,513
It gets crazy and catch him.
Apparently he used to throw side kicks 

1067
00:48:48,281 --> 00:48:49,120
off the roof and shit.

1068
00:48:49,150 --> 00:48:49,930
Yeah.
You know,

1069
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:53,950
shots for everyone.
First time I ever heard a wolf,

1070
00:48:54,250 --> 00:48:57,400
and this goes back to like the hair on 
your arms stand up.

1071
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:58,733
Um,
I was working with a buddy of mine and 

1072
00:48:59,711 --> 00:49:00,544
the Frank Church wilderness,
or is that just straight north to catch 

1073
00:49:03,431 --> 00:49:04,264
them?
It's the largest contiguous wilderness 

1074
00:49:06,101 --> 00:49:07,860
in the lower 48.
Really?

1075
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:09,190
Yeah.
It's huge.

1076
00:49:09,191 --> 00:49:10,730
And it tried to get people to.
Right.

1077
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:14,950
We tried to force people in there to 
mine and Pharma and it just didn't take.

1078
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:15,993
So there's old homesteads and stuff and 
there's some eerie stuff like the 

1079
00:49:18,221 --> 00:49:19,540
Missouri breaks.
Yes.

1080
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:20,470
Yeah.
Very,

1081
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:23,950
very similar.
This is just kind of a grander scale.

1082
00:49:23,970 --> 00:49:28,000
I'm much more timber and stuff.
Your guys' first experience out there,

1083
00:49:28,001 --> 00:49:30,490
I think I still think about that because
that was,

1084
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:31,773
I would love to put some of these like 
land transfer people out there on that 

1085
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:36,520
same trip.
Oh yeah.

1086
00:49:37,090 --> 00:49:40,930
These guys showed up.
It was like 34 degrees trying to snow.

1087
00:49:40,990 --> 00:49:45,310
Mostly just rain overcast grace guys.
Perfect.

1088
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:47,130
Nothing Mary about it.
Yeah,

1089
00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:49,140
it was awesome.
Worse temperature to deal with.

1090
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:50,080
Well then it,
it got

1091
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:51,510
done like nine,
you know,

1092
00:49:51,630 --> 00:49:53,280
it was getting real cold,
right?

1093
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:55,320
It was fucking awesome,
man.

1094
00:49:55,321 --> 00:49:56,154
It was awesome because it's just,
it's one of the things about being in 

1095
00:49:59,221 --> 00:50:04,221
the real wilderness is how like 
beautiful but lonely it is.

1096
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:08,400
It's kind of lonely.
There's something weird about it.

1097
00:50:08,401 --> 00:50:12,030
Like you could die and it doesn't give a
fuck.

1098
00:50:12,450 --> 00:50:14,370
You have this illusion like if you died 
right here,

1099
00:50:14,371 --> 00:50:16,530
if you had a heart attack and toe over,
we'd all be bummed out.

1100
00:50:16,890 --> 00:50:18,900
Like God,
we lost Ryan Callahan.

1101
00:50:18,901 --> 00:50:20,610
I can't believe it man.
And you know,

1102
00:50:20,611 --> 00:50:23,940
we'd be bummed out,
but the woods wouldn't give a fuck.

1103
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:27,470
You would just,
you'd fall dead and everything go.

1104
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:29,960
The,
the humble,

1105
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:35,320
the feeling of humility and the feeling 
of insignificance is so overwhelming and

1106
00:50:36,290 --> 00:50:41,240
unavoidable that it's just this intense 
realization of your piece.

1107
00:50:41,410 --> 00:50:45,470
Like where you are as a person,
where you fit in in this grand,

1108
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:49,990
gigantic Mandalah of life.
And it's like it's an

1109
00:50:50,210 --> 00:50:52,160
find the for the further.
You go back,

1110
00:50:52,161 --> 00:50:52,994
you know,
and you know your full day plus walk 

1111
00:50:55,581 --> 00:50:56,331
away,
you know,

1112
00:50:56,331 --> 00:50:59,600
or you get dropped off somewhere.
You know,

1113
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:01,130
it's like,
Whoa,

1114
00:51:01,790 --> 00:51:03,540
we're here.
You know,

1115
00:51:03,541 --> 00:51:04,220
it's,
it's a.

1116
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:05,930
it's a cool feeling though.
That's the whole thing,

1117
00:51:05,931 --> 00:51:07,070
right?
You're outside of your comfort zone.

1118
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:08,810
That's what makes it so pleasurable.

1119
00:51:08,950 --> 00:51:13,090
My friend Adam Green tree went on a do 
it yourself hunt in Montana and archery,

1120
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:14,733
elk hunt and he went,
I think he went at least 12 miles in 

1121
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:20,080
the.
Might've went more by himself,

1122
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:22,570
shot an elk big fucker.
Oh,

1123
00:51:23,030 --> 00:51:25,810
did out by himself.
Four days,

1124
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:26,913
four days a pack out.
So he's got 100 pounds on his back and 

1125
00:51:30,671 --> 00:51:35,671
he's got to walk 12 miles back and forth
for four days to get this elk out.

1126
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:41,640
That's heavy for folks who don't know,
that is four days of misery for days and

1127
00:51:41,990 --> 00:51:42,823
looking around and

1128
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:47,020
whistling through the woods and he's in 
decent shape.

1129
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,250
Me,
he works out a little bit,

1130
00:51:48,251 --> 00:51:49,540
but he's not campaigns,
you know,

1131
00:51:49,541 --> 00:51:51,460
he's not like some fucking crazy 
marathon,

1132
00:51:51,461 --> 00:51:54,300
ultra runner.
He's not as job to be fit.

1133
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:57,000
I mean,
he's a professional bowhunter hunter and

1134
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:58,960
he's got a mining job in Australia and 
this.

1135
00:51:58,961 --> 00:52:00,310
The other thing,
he lives in Australia,

1136
00:52:00,311 --> 00:52:01,990
so even though he brought all that meat 
back,

1137
00:52:02,050 --> 00:52:02,883
he couldn't even take it home.
He could only eat what he had here in 

1138
00:52:05,651 --> 00:52:07,390
America and then donate it.
Yeah,

1139
00:52:07,391 --> 00:52:09,610
you can't bring it back to Australia.
They don't allow that shame.

1140
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:13,390
Australian Customs.
They won't allow you to meet your trips.

1141
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:14,343
So let's say it did a little bit of meat
and his entire camp out on the first 

1142
00:52:18,881 --> 00:52:21,340
trip.
That's three loads of just meat.

1143
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:23,250
Eighty pounds load.
Yeah,

1144
00:52:23,251 --> 00:52:25,000
I mean that guy brought out a lot.

1145
00:52:25,630 --> 00:52:28,570
He brought it all back.
You brought it all back over four days.

1146
00:52:28,571 --> 00:52:29,404
But they described it like how brutal 
the experience was by himself shooting 

1147
00:52:35,471 --> 00:52:36,910
this animal.
And then he called a buddy,

1148
00:52:37,270 --> 00:52:38,170
um,
to uh,

1149
00:52:38,171 --> 00:52:39,004
to help him.
And this guy helped him pack out a 

1150
00:52:40,061 --> 00:52:40,894
little bit.

1151
00:52:41,330 --> 00:52:45,140
Imagine your bones laying there on the 
prairie in eastern Montana.

1152
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:49,130
There's a good chance because hunters do
the same thing,

1153
00:52:49,370 --> 00:52:51,470
right?
And Game Kinda does the same thing.

1154
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:56,500
Generation after generation generation.
Think about you tip over dead.

1155
00:52:57,020 --> 00:52:58,760
There's a very good chance in that 
country.

1156
00:52:58,761 --> 00:53:03,761
There's probably like a cro or sue set 
of bones underneath you.

1157
00:53:05,030 --> 00:53:05,863
Maybe somebody's horse.
Bison antic was all stacked up 

1158
00:53:10,971 --> 00:53:12,270
underneath,
you know,

1159
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:14,930
it does not give a fuck.
Doesn't give as well.

1160
00:53:14,931 --> 00:53:17,240
Any of bones out there.
You just joined in the pile

1161
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:20,650
and there's a whole system.
Like the idea of waste is ludicrous.

1162
00:53:21,010 --> 00:53:23,230
You know,
like if anything the dies,

1163
00:53:23,231 --> 00:53:24,064
it's not going to waste.
Like you're not going to waste your dog 

1164
00:53:26,581 --> 00:53:27,414
dies out there.
It's not going to waste something will 

1165
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:30,360
eat it.
And it is.

1166
00:53:30,390 --> 00:53:32,160
That is the whole system.
There is A.

1167
00:53:32,370 --> 00:53:34,980
I mean it doesn't seem like it to you as
a person.

1168
00:53:34,981 --> 00:53:36,600
You like,
you're not supposed to eat fluffy.

1169
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:38,730
He's my dog.
No,

1170
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:42,300
that's a dog and the dog is an animal 
and an animal that dies.

1171
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:45,850
There is a whole system in place for 
handling that for sure.

1172
00:53:45,870 --> 00:53:46,703
I mean from the wolf and the Fox is 
they'll come in and the birds and then 

1173
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:54,060
in the bacteria bugs everything and 
it'll be gone.

1174
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:56,910
It'll be down to bones and then 
eventually something will eat the bones.

1175
00:53:57,130 --> 00:54:00,640
Did you take the picture of the artery 
bulb?

1176
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:01,533
I posted this year,
had just left the face on and then took 

1177
00:54:04,301 --> 00:54:05,000
all the meat off.

1178
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:05,833
You did an amazing job.
That's so important to post too because 

1179
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:13,160
you didn't waste an ounce of that meat.
You cut every in between the ribs,

1180
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:13,980
you know,
you were.

1181
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:16,250
I mean,
and people were commenting on that photo

1182
00:54:16,270 --> 00:54:19,820
like that is the respect that you give 
an animal when you hunt it and you shoot

1183
00:54:19,821 --> 00:54:20,790
it.
That's the right way to end.

1184
00:54:21,010 --> 00:54:23,320
Yes.
Now the reality and I think so too.

1185
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:26,700
And I,
I try to go above and beyond.

1186
00:54:28,670 --> 00:54:30,310
Yeah.
I'm an organ meat guy too.

1187
00:54:30,311 --> 00:54:33,130
I love heart and liver.
I got a need.

1188
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:34,810
I'm going to start with tongues this 
year.

1189
00:54:34,870 --> 00:54:37,240
I was thinking about your liver.
Oh Dude.

1190
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:38,133
I had.
That was the worst thing to be vocal 

1191
00:54:40,331 --> 00:54:42,220
about ever.
I used to.

1192
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:44,440
I used to get called up all the time,
like,

1193
00:54:44,441 --> 00:54:45,274
Hey,
I got a tongue for you because I know 

1194
00:54:45,941 --> 00:54:49,310
you like him right now.
It's just overwhelmed with tongues.

1195
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:54,540
Everybody keeps their time and they keep
their tongue out of the bag.

1196
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:57,130
It is,
but you will love it.

1197
00:54:57,250 --> 00:54:58,940
But,
um,

1198
00:54:59,370 --> 00:55:01,300
the thing is like,
yeah,

1199
00:55:01,301 --> 00:55:02,134
you should take every single thing,
but there are little things to get 

1200
00:55:05,170 --> 00:55:06,003
wasted and like the rib meat chunks,
especially later in the season when 

1201
00:55:09,221 --> 00:55:10,810
there's not a lot of fat on these 
animals,

1202
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,033
like if it's,
if it's going to take you some time to 

1203
00:55:13,061 --> 00:55:13,894
get out,
that's the stuff that's going to get 

1204
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:20,220
super dry it out right before you can 
even make something out of it.

1205
00:55:20,501 --> 00:55:21,370
So,
um,

1206
00:55:21,730 --> 00:55:24,010
you were saying about liver.
Oh yeah.

1207
00:55:24,011 --> 00:55:27,340
So you made a comment that you eat a lot
of liver.

1208
00:55:27,570 --> 00:55:28,570
Yeah.
Like is that,

1209
00:55:29,110 --> 00:55:30,780
is that a typical la dish?

1210
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:32,040
No,
no,

1211
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:33,070
no,
no,

1212
00:55:33,071 --> 00:55:35,830
it's me just organ meats really good for
you.

1213
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:39,310
It was so high in vitamins and iron.
It's just.

1214
00:55:39,311 --> 00:55:41,770
And it's just something about,
it just feels good when I'm eating it,

1215
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:42,873
you know,
that's all I had read about wolves that 

1216
00:55:44,191 --> 00:55:46,240
wolves.
Like that's one of the ways that they,

1217
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:48,910
um,
that they established the alpha.

1218
00:55:48,911 --> 00:55:50,860
The alpha is the one that eats the 
deliver.

1219
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:52,600
When he killed,
when they kill an animal,

1220
00:55:52,601 --> 00:55:54,940
the Alpha immediately leads to liver.
Yeah.

1221
00:55:55,230 --> 00:55:56,063
Yeah.
There was this guy that was living with 

1222
00:55:56,951 --> 00:56:01,951
wolves and he had these wolves sort of 
convinced that he was a wolf and a,

1223
00:56:01,961 --> 00:56:02,794
it was,
he was a wildlife biologist and a both 

1224
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:06,610
expert,
and I forget where this was,

1225
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:08,320
that he was doing it,
but it was a whole documentary on it.

1226
00:56:08,321 --> 00:56:09,154
And,
but one of the things that they never 

1227
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:12,100
cry wolf,
I don't remember the name of it,

1228
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:12,700
unfortunately.

1229
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:13,533
Maybe Jamie can find it.
But one of the things that this guy did 

1230
00:56:15,431 --> 00:56:19,690
was he would put a liver in a downed 
animal,

1231
00:56:19,691 --> 00:56:21,490
like they would kill an animal,
place it put,

1232
00:56:21,491 --> 00:56:24,640
uh,
a liver in it and would eat the liver in

1233
00:56:24,641 --> 00:56:27,250
front of the other wolves so that he 
would be the dominant male.

1234
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:31,460
And where he got fucked up is he had to 
leave because it's a wolf expert.

1235
00:56:31,530 --> 00:56:34,570
There was a farmer that was being 
inundated by wolves.

1236
00:56:34,571 --> 00:56:35,404
So they had set up this whole way to 
keep the wolves away from this guy's 

1237
00:56:38,921 --> 00:56:39,754
property without killing them.
And one of the things that they did was 

1238
00:56:41,621 --> 00:56:42,454
they set up all these speakers and they 
projected the sounds of these alpha 

1239
00:56:45,641 --> 00:56:47,950
wolves with these giant speakers.
So like,

1240
00:56:47,951 --> 00:56:48,701
look,
bitch,

1241
00:56:48,701 --> 00:56:50,740
there's a new fucking king just moved 
into town.

1242
00:56:50,950 --> 00:56:52,420
Everybody get the hell away from these 
sheep.

1243
00:56:52,690 --> 00:56:55,690
And they set up these big ass speakers 
all over and it worked.

1244
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:59,980
But it took a long time to keep these 
wolves away like a couple of months.

1245
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:05,280
And so when he came back then there was 
a new alpha that had taken his place and

1246
00:57:05,291 --> 00:57:09,280
he wanted to kill him.
And it's a horrific scene where this guy

1247
00:57:09,281 --> 00:57:12,970
is standing there whimpering in front of
this wolf and this huge wolf is in front

1248
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:15,880
of him bearing his teeth.
And just thinking at any minute,

1249
00:57:15,881 --> 00:57:18,220
this wolf is just going to tear this 
guy's fucking face off.

1250
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:19,280
This real.
Oh yeah.

1251
00:57:19,281 --> 00:57:20,470
It's 100 percent real.
Yeah,

1252
00:57:20,471 --> 00:57:22,360
it's 100 percent real.
It's gnarly.

1253
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:26,050
When the wolfs in front of me and he's 
like,

1254
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:32,080
and he's got to hope that this wolf does
not decide to attack him.

1255
00:57:32,081 --> 00:57:33,530
That shows him mercy.
Yeah.

1256
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:36,070
He established a friendship with this 
wolf and he was the Alpha,

1257
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:39,970
the point where it's going to accept the
changing of positions and he has to show

1258
00:57:39,971 --> 00:57:42,220
no resistance to this change.

1259
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:45,580
So it's a really critical moment in his 
fucking life man,

1260
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:49,480
because it might end right there with 
that wolf in a bad way.

1261
00:57:50,770 --> 00:57:51,520
I mean,
you know,

1262
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:53,170
everything's happy when there's food 
around.

1263
00:57:53,410 --> 00:57:57,460
So if,
if late in the season and food scarce,

1264
00:57:57,550 --> 00:58:00,490
that would be a tough proposition of.
Yeah.

1265
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:01,593
Yeah.
Early in the season when everybody's 

1266
00:58:02,531 --> 00:58:04,540
happy,
that's calves on the ground.

1267
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:05,890
Easy pickins.
Yeah.

1268
00:58:05,891 --> 00:58:10,450
I was reading this article about bears 
and this one region of Alaska,

1269
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:11,313
whereas this salmon run and it's a.
We had a video of it where there's a 

1270
00:58:15,461 --> 00:58:16,294
guy,
I'm sure you've seen the video because 

1271
00:58:17,231 --> 00:58:19,300
it's a famous video where this guy is 
sitting there,

1272
00:58:19,301 --> 00:58:22,360
he's got a little lawn chair and they're
taking photographs of the bears and this

1273
00:58:22,361 --> 00:58:27,361
fucking Volkswagen bus with hair walks 
up to him and just hangs out and there's

1274
00:58:29,651 --> 00:58:31,970
no danger.
There's no fear because it's bear.

1275
00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:34,300
It's fat and there's a salmon 
everywhere.

1276
00:58:34,301 --> 00:58:36,080
And as the guy pans away,
he,

1277
00:58:36,130 --> 00:58:36,821
he,
he goes,

1278
00:58:36,821 --> 00:58:38,110
get out of here,
bear and the bear,

1279
00:58:38,930 --> 00:58:42,550
the bear leaves.
But I mean it's fucking 1500 pound bear.

1280
00:58:42,551 --> 00:58:43,384
It's an enormous.
People even get how big they are until 

1281
00:58:46,711 --> 00:58:48,770
you're right there,
you probably can't know.

1282
00:58:48,850 --> 00:58:49,683
But as this guy pans away,
you see that there's just like a dozen 

1283
00:58:52,330 --> 00:58:56,690
bears and this one area and they're so 
well fed this store,

1284
00:58:56,730 --> 00:59:01,730
this area historically has an incredibly
low incident or low rate of attack.

1285
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:06,850
There's like almost no attacks by bears 
on people in this one area.

1286
00:59:06,970 --> 00:59:09,730
This is it.
Food is food is the deal.

1287
00:59:09,970 --> 00:59:11,330
Look at that fucking thing.
Oh yeah.

1288
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:14,710
You can sit in this one too.
I mean that is,

1289
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:16,320
that's a tanker.
Oh,

1290
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:18,520
we did.
We contacted you.

1291
00:59:18,521 --> 00:59:20,680
Get Ahold of Adam about that fucking TV.

1292
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:22,220
I told them to contact you.
Did he contact?

1293
00:59:22,230 --> 00:59:24,140
Okay.
Places TV.

1294
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:25,033
August decides.
That fucker just decides to sit down 

1295
00:59:28,310 --> 00:59:29,890
behind you.
This TV sucks.

1296
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:31,340
He's cutting out.
Yeah.

1297
00:59:31,341 --> 00:59:33,230
So he's.
This guy has to chase his bear off.

1298
00:59:33,470 --> 00:59:35,540
But now look,
as the bear goes over,

1299
00:59:35,541 --> 00:59:38,750
whatever it means,
got a big fat belly and you turn and you

1300
00:59:38,751 --> 00:59:41,240
look down at the river and it's just 
overrun.

1301
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:42,530
Look behind you.
Look behind you.

1302
00:59:42,531 --> 00:59:43,620
Fuck that TV.
Let's see.

1303
00:59:43,630 --> 00:59:45,950
Be such a piece of shit.
But look behind you.

1304
00:59:45,951 --> 00:59:48,140
Look at all those little bears.
I mean,

1305
00:59:48,141 --> 00:59:49,760
that's insane.
One,

1306
00:59:49,761 --> 00:59:50,331
two,
three,

1307
00:59:50,331 --> 00:59:51,170
four,
five,

1308
00:59:51,171 --> 00:59:51,981
six,
seven,

1309
00:59:51,981 --> 00:59:52,611
eight,
nine,

1310
00:59:52,611 --> 00:59:53,091
10,
11,

1311
00:59:53,091 --> 00:59:53,661
12,
13,

1312
00:59:53,661 --> 00:59:54,494
14,
14 bears in just this limited 

1313
00:59:56,991 --> 00:59:57,824
perspective.
And this guy's taken photos of them 

1314
00:59:59,690 --> 01:00:00,980
because it's just.
And there's more,

1315
01:00:01,190 --> 01:00:04,100
there's just overrun,
just overrun with fish.

1316
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:08,120
We were fishing up in Prince Wales up 
Steve's fish shack.

1317
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:08,570
Yeah.
Yeah.

1318
01:00:08,570 --> 01:00:09,400
And,
and,

1319
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:11,840
uh,
we had his little boy in the canoe,

1320
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:14,270
so there's three of us in the canoe and 
we had,

1321
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:15,433
it was high tide and we paddled away up 
this creek and there were six black 

1322
01:00:18,561 --> 01:00:19,394
bears in this creek that's as wide as 
this room and we're just sitting in the 

1323
01:00:23,451 --> 01:00:27,580
canoe and we kind of pushed the,
the bow of the canoe on the stick.

1324
01:00:27,581 --> 01:00:30,950
So it hold us in place.
And Steve's kid,

1325
01:00:31,070 --> 01:00:31,940
you know,
being a kid,

1326
01:00:31,970 --> 01:00:35,510
he's like bears or bad bears are scary.
It's like,

1327
01:00:35,511 --> 01:00:36,344
what are we doing here?
But you could watch these bears take 

1328
01:00:39,021 --> 01:00:44,021
turns and there was one lane in this 
creek and as the salmon would,

1329
01:00:45,470 --> 01:00:47,360
the water's dropping right at the tide's
going out.

1330
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:51,950
So the salmon would come up the bear 
weight for one to be easy,

1331
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:54,050
grab it,
walk into the woods.

1332
01:00:54,290 --> 01:00:56,930
The next barrier would come down,
lay in the same spot,

1333
01:00:57,740 --> 01:00:59,330
and just wait.
So it was like a line.

1334
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:03,890
There was a food line and everybody was 
totally cool with each other.

1335
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:07,320
We're all going to get some plenty of 
food.

1336
01:01:07,321 --> 01:01:08,430
No conflict.
I mean,

1337
01:01:08,431 --> 01:01:10,220
isn't that the same with people?
Yeah.

1338
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:15,210
It's like kind of universal amongst all 
species as resources get scarce.

1339
01:01:15,270 --> 01:01:16,740
Shit gets weird.
Yeah,

1340
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:21,600
I mean and that,
that is one of the things that's sort of

1341
01:01:21,601 --> 01:01:22,434
important to bring up when people are 
talking about wolves and predators and 

1342
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:27,133
populations.
Like you can't ensure that these things 

1343
01:01:29,491 --> 01:01:31,470
are going to have an adequate food 
supply,

1344
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:34,630
especially as their numbers grow higher 
and higher.

1345
01:01:34,740 --> 01:01:35,573
It's,
it's a really controversial subject in 

1346
01:01:37,990 --> 01:01:38,823
it.
I think the one thing that people don't 

1347
01:01:40,351 --> 01:01:41,184
understand from the outside that really 
don't understand the whole idea of 

1348
01:01:45,811 --> 01:01:47,890
hunting predators,
they,

1349
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:51,120
I feel like really kind of have to be 
there.

1350
01:01:51,270 --> 01:01:52,103
I feel like you kinda have to like 
almost be just really involved in that 

1351
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:57,113
whole ecosystem.
Just be there physically to kind of get 

1352
01:01:59,941 --> 01:02:00,774
it to you.

1353
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:01,773
I think that's probably accurate.
I think it would be almost odd to be 

1354
01:02:04,181 --> 01:02:06,880
like,
I'm going to go shoot some animal.

1355
01:02:06,881 --> 01:02:08,860
You've never seen no.
Nothing.

1356
01:02:09,250 --> 01:02:10,630
You know what I mean?
That would be,

1357
01:02:10,690 --> 01:02:12,820
there's a certain cruelty to that,
but maybe,

1358
01:02:12,821 --> 01:02:13,631
maybe not,
I don't know.

1359
01:02:13,631 --> 01:02:16,360
But once you're,
once you've seen the cycle,

1360
01:02:16,361 --> 01:02:18,550
like in person,
it kind of,

1361
01:02:18,830 --> 01:02:19,663
I don't know,
it brings everything together if you 

1362
01:02:20,611 --> 01:02:21,690
will.
You see like,

1363
01:02:21,710 --> 01:02:22,321
you know,
wow,

1364
01:02:22,321 --> 01:02:26,010
that's interesting that you know,
that they're um,

1365
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:27,083
you know,
that they're around now and I hopefully 

1366
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:30,330
don't get too many of them,
but you know,

1367
01:02:30,331 --> 01:02:32,080
maybe it's a good thing and maybe,
you know,

1368
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:36,060
certainly in our unit things are.
Elk are fine.

1369
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:38,390
Well,
balance is so super important,

1370
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:39,433
which is one of the reason why places 
like New Zealand or so odd because they 

1371
01:02:42,741 --> 01:02:43,574
brought over imprint incredibly odd.
They brought over all these animals and 

1372
01:02:47,211 --> 01:02:48,044
the what is like the 18 hundreds,
the Europeans brought them over England 

1373
01:02:50,481 --> 01:02:51,314
and brought them over.
Is that what it was even earlier than 

1374
01:02:52,761 --> 01:02:53,320
that?

1375
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:57,460
Earlier in that all the way to say thank
God.

1376
01:02:57,461 --> 01:03:02,461
I think Roosevelt gave him a Canada 
geese and the Mallard duck and like 19.

1377
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,560
Oh five or something like that.

1378
01:03:05,610 --> 01:03:06,443
So what they did was they brought all 
these animals over there with no 

1379
01:03:09,181 --> 01:03:10,014
predators at all and so they have wild 
stags and these red deer and all these 

1380
01:03:15,811 --> 01:03:16,644
different animals that are not native 
and they're overrun to the point where 

1381
01:03:20,191 --> 01:03:22,950
they have to do helicopter runs,
unfucking stag.

1382
01:03:23,310 --> 01:03:24,370
They have to fly over and

1383
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:30,740
poison poison a whole valley because the
possums or whatever go crazy,

1384
01:03:30,741 --> 01:03:32,840
you know?
And there's nothing left to control it.

1385
01:03:32,841 --> 01:03:33,674
It's nuts.
And you gotta think the thinking was no 

1386
01:03:34,791 --> 01:03:36,260
predators,
this is going to be great.

1387
01:03:36,410 --> 01:03:38,210
Everybody's gonna get along and it's 
going to be.

1388
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:39,710
And we'll have food.

1389
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:44,680
Well the idea was that New Zealand was 
going to be an exotic hunting ground for

1390
01:03:44,681 --> 01:03:45,514
the wealthy.
It was going to be like a Texas ranch 

1391
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:49,250
for.
Yes,

1392
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:50,733
yes.
They were going to come over and they 

1393
01:03:51,461 --> 01:03:52,294
were going to jolly good time.
I'm going to go hunt a stag and they 

1394
01:03:56,021 --> 01:03:59,740
would go over there.
And so they put these animals there,

1395
01:03:59,741 --> 01:04:00,574
but then they just,
there's nothing killing them other than 

1396
01:04:02,471 --> 01:04:05,440
people.
And so they're just fucking like crazy.

1397
01:04:05,441 --> 01:04:07,800
And making baby stags and just,
whew.

1398
01:04:07,830 --> 01:04:09,610
This is a parties.
Plenty of food.

1399
01:04:09,611 --> 01:04:12,370
It's all lush and green.
It rains like crazy.

1400
01:04:12,371 --> 01:04:14,050
So there's plenty of food.
Beautiful.

1401
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:15,633
Stunning.

1402
01:04:15,730 --> 01:04:17,380
Kenton has been over there.
I have not made it.

1403
01:04:17,381 --> 01:04:18,720
Yeah.
Did you hunt over there?

1404
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:21,280
It wasn't like,
it was cool.

1405
01:04:21,281 --> 01:04:25,120
We just kind of went over there and met 
our,

1406
01:04:25,121 --> 01:04:25,900
uh,
our,

1407
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:29,350
some of our wool growers and they rented
a helicopter and they kind of dropped us

1408
01:04:29,351 --> 01:04:32,300
off in the middle of nowhere.
And so.

1409
01:04:32,420 --> 01:04:33,820
So we'll see in a couple days.
Yeah,

1410
01:04:33,821 --> 01:04:34,654
exactly.
They could drop stuff on top of this 

1411
01:04:35,681 --> 01:04:36,101
hill.
We,

1412
01:04:36,101 --> 01:04:37,990
I was ready to get out of the bird,
frankly,

1413
01:04:37,991 --> 01:04:38,824
it was like crushing snow and I mean 
I've been in helicopters a solid amount 

1414
01:04:43,751 --> 01:04:46,540
and I don't love them and I was like,
I'll walk back,

1415
01:04:46,570 --> 01:04:47,890
like,
let's get down.

1416
01:04:47,891 --> 01:04:51,040
So we got down and you know,
and just made our way out.

1417
01:04:51,041 --> 01:04:56,041
Ended up shooting a really nice shammy 
was really wild looking animals wild.

1418
01:04:56,441 --> 01:04:57,274
Yeah.
I mean we didn't even know like how big 

1419
01:04:58,571 --> 01:05:00,310
anything.
We're just out there and we're like,

1420
01:05:00,311 --> 01:05:03,370
how does the Shammy shot?
Those are native to that area,

1421
01:05:03,371 --> 01:05:04,180
you know?
No,

1422
01:05:04,180 --> 01:05:05,530
we took it apart and pet,
you know,

1423
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:06,513
put all the meat and everything and 
started walking out and almost left the 

1424
01:05:08,981 --> 01:05:10,480
head there.
Then like,

1425
01:05:10,510 --> 01:05:11,470
let's bring the head,
you know,

1426
01:05:11,471 --> 01:05:12,880
it turns out some,
you know,

1427
01:05:13,150 --> 01:05:16,420
it was like a sci goal.
It would never seen one before.

1428
01:05:16,421 --> 01:05:17,470
They're all so small,
you know,

1429
01:05:17,471 --> 01:05:18,430
they taste phenomenal.

1430
01:05:18,430 --> 01:05:19,263
So that night we got sci.
Gold is always trying to say like the 

1431
01:05:22,541 --> 01:05:24,360
size of it.
It was like a trophy size down.

1432
01:05:24,390 --> 01:05:25,930
That's what I mean.
And it was,

1433
01:05:26,110 --> 01:05:28,720
which I thought was just how they fund 
all that stuff.

1434
01:05:28,780 --> 01:05:33,490
They do it in gold,
they have like silver inches,

1435
01:05:33,860 --> 01:05:35,650
but then it puts you into a different 
category.

1436
01:05:35,651 --> 01:05:40,651
So it's like a 400 inch elk or a 200 
inch white tail.

1437
01:05:40,751 --> 01:05:41,680
Like there's this.
Yes.

1438
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:42,890
Just No.
Yeah,

1439
01:05:43,130 --> 01:05:45,400
like a number that very few people ever 
achieve.

1440
01:05:45,460 --> 01:05:46,293
Right?
Yes.

1441
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:48,250
But it was um,
I don't know.

1442
01:05:48,251 --> 01:05:51,100
I'm not a huge number.
Of course I like to pay attention,

1443
01:05:51,101 --> 01:05:52,380
but whatever.
But um,

1444
01:05:52,420 --> 01:05:55,060
it's super yummy.
Shammies like super good.

1445
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:57,870
What does it taste like?
Just kind of tastes like,

1446
01:05:58,170 --> 01:05:59,350
I dunno,
like lamb.

1447
01:05:59,830 --> 01:06:03,940
I would say a cross between like a lamb 
under the good white tail.

1448
01:06:04,390 --> 01:06:06,280
Look at that thing.
What a weird animal,

1449
01:06:06,340 --> 01:06:08,560
isn't it?
Wow.

1450
01:06:08,650 --> 01:06:11,830
And they're everywhere.
Whenever I see a big fat guy with a dead

1451
01:06:11,831 --> 01:06:12,664
animal with a rifle,
I feel like there's something wrong 

1452
01:06:15,191 --> 01:06:16,024
there.
Yeah.

1453
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:19,760
How does that guy get up there?
You know,

1454
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:21,850
I feel like you should.
I mean,

1455
01:06:21,851 --> 01:06:24,790
this is totally ignorant on my part and 
very biased,

1456
01:06:24,791 --> 01:06:25,624
but I feel like you should have to be in
shape to kill something that lives up 

1457
01:06:27,941 --> 01:06:28,774
there.
When I see a fat guy that figures out a 

1458
01:06:30,791 --> 01:06:31,840
way how to do it,
and I'm like,

1459
01:06:31,870 --> 01:06:33,160
all right,
that's a short rope.

1460
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:36,000
Damn short.
Roped with.

1461
01:06:36,001 --> 01:06:36,834
Sent me up.
Like when guys climb everest that are 

1462
01:06:38,830 --> 01:06:41,710
not fit,
they'll have a guide that just basically

1463
01:06:41,711 --> 01:06:44,680
short puts a short rope on and 
basically.

1464
01:06:44,681 --> 01:06:45,700
Yeah,
yeah.

1465
01:06:45,820 --> 01:06:46,840
Holy Shit.
Yeah.

1466
01:06:46,841 --> 01:06:48,490
Aggressive guiding.
What is it?

1467
01:06:48,610 --> 01:06:49,443
What the fuck is wrong with someone that
doesn't get fit and want to climb 

1468
01:06:51,971 --> 01:06:55,390
everest?
I just think that they have no idea what

1469
01:06:55,391 --> 01:06:56,860
it's like to be above 8,000
meters.

1470
01:06:56,861 --> 01:07:01,690
Like they might sit there and go on the 
treadmill every single day and I don't.

1471
01:07:01,810 --> 01:07:02,643
I don't know.

1472
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,250
Meters is what's really important 
because 8,000

1473
01:07:05,251 --> 01:07:07,440
feet sucks at east.
I lived,

1474
01:07:07,470 --> 01:07:09,570
when I lived in Boulder,
we were at 8,500

1475
01:07:09,571 --> 01:07:12,750
feet and I would do my kettlebell 
routine at 8,500

1476
01:07:12,751 --> 01:07:13,584
feet and it was just like,
was like trying to like run through 

1477
01:07:16,531 --> 01:07:17,970
water.
It was like,

1478
01:07:17,971 --> 01:07:19,680
Jesus Christ,
this is hard to do.

1479
01:07:20,130 --> 01:07:20,963
It was incredibly hard to do so much 
more difficult than it is to do at sea 

1480
01:07:23,221 --> 01:07:26,250
level.
I couldn't imagine went 8,000

1481
01:07:26,251 --> 01:07:27,250
meters is like

1482
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:28,820
narrow.
It's like three percent.

1483
01:07:28,821 --> 01:07:31,550
I think you lose something like three 
percent efficiency every thousand feet.

1484
01:07:32,580 --> 01:07:37,580
You come down to sea level and feet 
every thousand thousand meters,

1485
01:07:37,821 --> 01:07:39,650
you're talking about 24,000,
25,

1486
01:07:39,651 --> 01:07:41,690
26,000
feet and it's insane.

1487
01:07:41,691 --> 01:07:43,070
It's insane.
It's insane.

1488
01:07:43,180 --> 01:07:44,990
Then you come down to sea level and for 
me I'm like,

1489
01:07:44,991 --> 01:07:46,070
ah,
running's pointless.

1490
01:07:46,100 --> 01:07:49,540
This is been running for a while now.
Yeah.

1491
01:07:50,490 --> 01:07:52,440
Yeah.
That was one thing that I noticed when I

1492
01:07:52,441 --> 01:07:54,870
did live up there for,
it was only like for four months,

1493
01:07:54,871 --> 01:07:55,704
but when I'd go down to sea level,
I felt like I could fucking run through 

1494
01:07:58,231 --> 01:07:59,340
walls.
Yes,

1495
01:07:59,341 --> 01:08:03,420
I can now I get why those guys like 
train at elevation and then go and fight

1496
01:08:03,421 --> 01:08:05,340
at sea level because that's a big thing 
with fighters.

1497
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:08,280
A lot of them were trained in Denver or 
up here that go to big bear.

1498
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:10,170
Sure.
It goes away fast though.

1499
01:08:10,171 --> 01:08:14,890
It literally like you're,
you acclimate here probably back.

1500
01:08:15,230 --> 01:08:16,280
I don't know.
It seems like not

1501
01:08:16,430 --> 01:08:17,960
five days in your,
you know,

1502
01:08:18,550 --> 01:08:19,940
it takes the same when you go back up 
though,

1503
01:08:19,941 --> 01:08:21,730
if you've been at sea level for a while,
you go back up.

1504
01:08:21,731 --> 01:08:24,140
It takes awhile before you're kind of.
Yeah,

1505
01:08:24,141 --> 01:08:25,070
I think,
yeah,

1506
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:30,050
I think they say that the best way to do
it is actually to train at low altitude,

1507
01:08:30,380 --> 01:08:31,213
but to live at high altitude so 
[inaudible] you could put in more work 

1508
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:39,980
so like you go down for the training,
like say if you were next to big bear,

1509
01:08:40,010 --> 01:08:43,730
you would drive down and then train it 
like you know,

1510
01:08:43,731 --> 01:08:44,564
wherever down there and then bust your 
ass and San Bernardino or whatever and 

1511
01:08:48,471 --> 01:08:49,304
then go back up the hill and sleep and 
eat and do all your stuff at high 

1512
01:08:53,511 --> 01:08:54,344
altitude.
So where your high workload is like for 

1513
01:08:56,091 --> 01:08:56,924
the maximum efficiency of your training 
because you could get a 100 reps in it 

1514
01:09:00,230 --> 01:09:01,000
will elevate.

1515
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,690
Exactly.
Get more work in.

1516
01:09:02,780 --> 01:09:03,613
You can do more work.
You can and you can do it also for 

1517
01:09:05,811 --> 01:09:06,644
fighting.
It's super important to not be tired 

1518
01:09:09,170 --> 01:09:11,610
while you're doing certain technical 
work like you,

1519
01:09:11,630 --> 01:09:12,920
you're going to be certain amount of 
tired,

1520
01:09:12,930 --> 01:09:16,100
but you don't want to be exhausted 
because your brain doesn't work,

1521
01:09:16,101 --> 01:09:16,490
right?
No,

1522
01:09:16,490 --> 01:09:19,310
you drop your hands,
you develop shitty skills.

1523
01:09:19,350 --> 01:09:20,183
You,
you start making errors in your 

1524
01:09:22,671 --> 01:09:25,760
technique and those errors and you 
technique will manifest themselves under

1525
01:09:25,761 --> 01:09:26,594
pressure.
So it's like one of the things about 

1526
01:09:28,161 --> 01:09:28,994
fighting is it's super important that 
you do everything in training exactly 

1527
01:09:32,631 --> 01:09:34,700
how you would do it if your fucking life
depended on it.

1528
01:09:34,940 --> 01:09:35,773
And if you don't,
you're going to pay a price like guys 

1529
01:09:37,131 --> 01:09:40,460
who slack off in training.
They almost never become champions.

1530
01:09:40,461 --> 01:09:41,294
I mean,
unless you're some physical freak who 

1531
01:09:42,291 --> 01:09:43,080
can get away with it.

1532
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:43,913
The reality is in order to compete 
against likeminded people that are also 

1533
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:53,680
phenomenally fit and motivated and 
understand the consequences of not being

1534
01:09:53,841 --> 01:09:57,650
fit and motivated and well trained,
you have to do everything right.

1535
01:09:57,890 --> 01:10:00,830
And especially now like mma,
you can get away with a lot.

1536
01:10:00,860 --> 01:10:01,830
When I started,
uh,

1537
01:10:01,910 --> 01:10:06,260
doing commentary in 1997,
you could get away with a lot because it

1538
01:10:06,261 --> 01:10:07,094
wasn't not a lot.
I mean just the level of competition 

1539
01:10:09,951 --> 01:10:10,784
just was not the same as it is now.
But now the people are so good that the 

1540
01:10:13,851 --> 01:10:14,684
margin of error is so small.
The difference between victory and 

1541
01:10:16,941 --> 01:10:21,830
defeat is so small that it's just so 
much high level activity going on in mma

1542
01:10:21,831 --> 01:10:24,890
fights that you can't,
you can't fuck around and anywhere where

1543
01:10:24,891 --> 01:10:27,230
your nutrition with your recovery,
with your,

1544
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:28,333
you know,
like all the different things that 

1545
01:10:28,731 --> 01:10:29,564
you're doing outside of training,
like cryotherapy or floating or all 

1546
01:10:33,681 --> 01:10:34,820
these different things that people do.

1547
01:10:35,150 --> 01:10:35,983
Sauna,
it's another thing that a lot of guys 

1548
01:10:36,861 --> 01:10:37,694
do.
All those different things are like 

1549
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:39,433
hugely import because these little tiny 
edges but also technique like your 

1550
01:10:42,891 --> 01:10:46,970
technique has to be efficient and it has
to be correct so that in the heat of the

1551
01:10:46,971 --> 01:10:48,330
moment you,
you're,

1552
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:49,193
you never think of doing things wrong 
because you've never done anything 

1553
01:10:51,111 --> 01:10:52,520
wrong.
Every time you're training,

1554
01:10:52,521 --> 01:10:54,650
you're doing things correctly and that 
might not even save.

1555
01:10:54,651 --> 01:10:57,110
You still might get head kicked,
so you're basically,

1556
01:10:57,111 --> 01:10:59,390
you're,
you're at when you're at your worst,

1557
01:10:59,391 --> 01:11:00,950
you're still the best yet.
Well,

1558
01:11:00,951 --> 01:11:02,510
there's no,
that's the problem.

1559
01:11:02,511 --> 01:11:07,511
The best fluctuates when you're dealing 
with like world championship level,

1560
01:11:07,851 --> 01:11:09,920
right?
Like say like a division,

1561
01:11:09,921 --> 01:11:13,320
like say the UFC is 170 pound division,
very competitive division,

1562
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:14,633
so competitive that the last title fight
resulted in a draw and one of the first 

1563
01:11:18,541 --> 01:11:20,940
draws.
There's only three draws and the history

1564
01:11:20,941 --> 01:11:22,260
of the UFC and title fights.

1565
01:11:22,950 --> 01:11:26,130
So this fight lines have been a draw and
then there's a bunch of other guys fuck.

1566
01:11:26,420 --> 01:11:30,180
And just straight killers waiting in the
wings to have their shot at the title.

1567
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:34,980
So in any given day one of these guys 
might be able to be one of those guys,

1568
01:11:34,981 --> 01:11:35,814
like one of these guys comes in a little
bit sick as a little bit of a cold from 

1569
01:11:38,371 --> 01:11:39,204
training or maybe they're breaking up 
with their girlfriend or heads a little 

1570
01:11:41,641 --> 01:11:43,620
fucked up,
which happens a lot.

1571
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:47,120
Yeah.
It was like,

1572
01:11:47,130 --> 01:11:48,860
stay away from the ladies.
Ah,

1573
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:50,050
that's bullshit.
Yeah.

1574
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:50,933
Sometimes sometimes it's actually better
to have sex because then you're not 

1575
01:11:53,761 --> 01:11:55,350
thinking about sex,
you know,

1576
01:11:55,620 --> 01:11:58,250
but everybody hasn't really seen mindset
all the time ran.

1577
01:11:58,260 --> 01:11:58,721
It's like,
yeah,

1578
01:11:58,721 --> 01:12:00,670
you got to be off the ladies if you're 
going to train.

1579
01:12:01,810 --> 01:12:02,643
A lot of fighters do think that though,
like a Hixon Gracie was one of the 

1580
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:06,900
greatest Jujitsu fighters were all time.

1581
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:09,390
He wouldn't have sex for like months,
months out.

1582
01:12:09,450 --> 01:12:12,600
Now.
Andre's just furious to be a Mike Tyson.

1583
01:12:13,170 --> 01:12:15,790
Mike Tyson would get his dick sucked 
right before he knocked someone the fuck

1584
01:12:15,810 --> 01:12:17,010
out.
He didn't give a shit.

1585
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:18,840
He was like that.
Both you and I'm here for.

1586
01:12:18,850 --> 01:12:21,480
I'm like,
here's a great quote.

1587
01:12:22,260 --> 01:12:23,670
Mike Tyson has a great quote.
He said,

1588
01:12:23,671 --> 01:12:24,504
uh,
if a god invented anything better than 

1589
01:12:26,101 --> 01:12:26,934
pussies,
keeping it to himself so he would have 

1590
01:12:31,171 --> 01:12:33,660
sex like right before he fought and just
destroy everybody.

1591
01:12:33,661 --> 01:12:36,000
So an interesting put that in 
perspective.

1592
01:12:36,001 --> 01:12:38,640
It doesn't make any sense.
He's not known to be a wordsmith either.

1593
01:12:38,641 --> 01:12:43,260
That's actually not the most educated 
guy obviously,

1594
01:12:43,261 --> 01:12:46,620
but not a stupid man and any by any 
stretch of the imagination.

1595
01:12:46,740 --> 01:12:47,850
I heard that show.
He did,

1596
01:12:47,851 --> 01:12:49,680
it was fantastic.
I heard it's amazing.

1597
01:12:49,681 --> 01:12:52,500
I never got a chance to see it that uh,
I saw the documentary,

1598
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:55,320
but I never saw the live show is live 
show is supposed to be amazing.

1599
01:12:55,350 --> 01:12:56,990
Oh,
you did a standup show.

1600
01:12:57,300 --> 01:12:58,051
Sort of.
Yeah,

1601
01:12:58,051 --> 01:12:59,640
like a,
just a story of his life.

1602
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:03,180
Yeah.
It's supposed to be just insane.

1603
01:13:03,181 --> 01:13:05,000
Everybody that has seen it said you got 
to see it.

1604
01:13:05,001 --> 01:13:06,600
It's amazing.
That's cool.

1605
01:13:06,870 --> 01:13:07,980
Yeah.
But anyway,

1606
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:10,050
sex for him.
Yes.

1607
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:12,600
He would have the sex.
It's not for everybody.

1608
01:13:12,780 --> 01:13:13,613
It's just.
I mean it's certainly lower your 

1609
01:13:14,671 --> 01:13:17,520
testosterone a little bit,
but I mean if you're fit and prepared,

1610
01:13:17,521 --> 01:13:19,890
it might relax you where you get a good 
night's sleep,

1611
01:13:20,450 --> 01:13:21,283
you know,
because that's one of the things about 

1612
01:13:21,931 --> 01:13:25,470
these guys is like anxiety,
staying up late,

1613
01:13:25,530 --> 01:13:27,390
you know,
just trying to get your shit together,

1614
01:13:27,391 --> 01:13:29,200
making sure you get a good night's sleep
so you could,

1615
01:13:29,490 --> 01:13:31,380
you don't get sick.
Don't let the.

1616
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:34,020
Don't be overwhelmed by the pressure of 
the moment.

1617
01:13:35,260 --> 01:13:37,650
It's a lot going on.
Helia and you know,

1618
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:38,513
you've,
once you've introduced the possibility 

1619
01:13:40,681 --> 01:13:45,681
of just getting the shit kicked daddy,
that raises the anxiety significantly.

1620
01:13:45,990 --> 01:13:46,823
Sure.
That now think about the anxiety of 

1621
01:13:49,741 --> 01:13:52,230
releasing a perfect arrow on a beautiful
animal.

1622
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:53,393
You know,
there's a lot of anxiety involved in 

1623
01:13:54,271 --> 01:13:56,220
that and it's something that people on 
the outside,

1624
01:13:56,550 --> 01:13:59,670
I've heard people say ridiculous things 
when it comes to hunting,

1625
01:13:59,671 --> 01:14:02,250
but one of the most ridiculous things 
that people have to say is,

1626
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:04,710
you know,
there's no skill involved in that.

1627
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:08,310
All you're doing is you're shooting a 
defenseless animal like do you,

1628
01:14:08,430 --> 01:14:09,263
you have no idea.
You don't know what you're talking 

1629
01:14:10,711 --> 01:14:12,160
about.
It's insanely difficult.

1630
01:14:12,490 --> 01:14:15,280
It's so difficult to keep your shit 
together and that moment.

1631
01:14:15,490 --> 01:14:16,323
And if you're a person who is 
compassionate and who understands the 

1632
01:14:19,961 --> 01:14:23,170
consequences of wounding an animal and 
what's what's at stake here,

1633
01:14:23,410 --> 01:14:24,243
and you know,
the responsibility of making a perfect 

1634
01:14:26,711 --> 01:14:31,600
shot and in a clean kill is very anxiety
filled moment.

1635
01:14:32,130 --> 01:14:34,160
Absolutely.
And I'll tell you right now,

1636
01:14:35,870 --> 01:14:37,410
you know,
I've been around a lot of death.

1637
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:40,080
I'm not necessarily by my hands,
but you know,

1638
01:14:40,081 --> 01:14:41,940
doing the guidance gig and stuff like 
that.

1639
01:14:42,050 --> 01:14:43,600
Um,
I,

1640
01:14:44,750 --> 01:14:45,583
I did not ever think I was susceptible 
to that anxiety of being behind the 

1641
01:14:48,691 --> 01:14:51,390
trigger because I'd been around it so,
so much.

1642
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:52,433
So what I'm trying to say is once you 
get that skill to be column behind the 

1643
01:14:56,221 --> 01:14:59,430
trigger or on the string,
if you're releasing an arrow,

1644
01:14:59,850 --> 01:15:02,130
it's not necessarily something that's 
going to stay with you.

1645
01:15:02,460 --> 01:15:03,293
Right.
It's not an automatic deal because I 

1646
01:15:05,821 --> 01:15:09,660
missed the largest mule deer in my life 
this year with a rifle that really art.

1647
01:15:09,940 --> 01:15:10,860
No.
Where's Neil dear?

1648
01:15:10,861 --> 01:15:14,310
I've ever seen no bigger than the one 
that you killed with Steve.

1649
01:15:14,370 --> 01:15:15,510
Yes.
That's insane.

1650
01:15:15,810 --> 01:15:19,470
That was massive.
That one that Steve killed was huge.

1651
01:15:19,710 --> 01:15:22,530
How has it bigger this thing,
man?

1652
01:15:22,620 --> 01:15:26,190
I just don't.
We hiked for a two and a half days.

1653
01:15:26,580 --> 01:15:27,330
My Buddy,
uh,

1654
01:15:27,330 --> 01:15:30,150
Kayla reared and he's the to boiled out 
your mule deer skull.

1655
01:15:31,030 --> 01:15:32,110
A,
your Montana animal.

1656
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:33,153
Um,

1657
01:15:34,650 --> 01:15:36,380
we,
I mean we hiked for two and a half days.

1658
01:15:36,390 --> 01:15:38,490
He and he and his wife were having a 
baby.

1659
01:15:38,491 --> 01:15:39,324
So we were like,
got to make this happen because we're 

1660
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:43,320
not going to happen next.
How far in did you guys go?

1661
01:15:43,770 --> 01:15:45,450
We were,
um,

1662
01:15:47,430 --> 01:15:49,680
seven miles probably.
Um,

1663
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:53,880
so you're going over and under over 
elevation climbing mountains.

1664
01:15:54,180 --> 01:15:54,961
Yeah.
Basically,

1665
01:15:54,961 --> 01:15:57,930
you know,
a big river crossing,

1666
01:15:58,130 --> 01:16:00,630
um,
big climb,

1667
01:16:00,690 --> 01:16:05,100
try to follow a major drainage up,
couldn't find anything or found very,

1668
01:16:05,101 --> 01:16:06,730
very little.
Um,

1669
01:16:06,780 --> 01:16:08,580
just nasty,
nasty country.

1670
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:14,130
Finally find one mule deer,
fond sunsetting.

1671
01:16:14,131 --> 01:16:15,840
There's a meal,
have your phone on this ridge line.

1672
01:16:16,860 --> 01:16:17,311
I'm like,
well,

1673
01:16:17,311 --> 01:16:20,610
let's just camp here because we have to 
leave the next day.

1674
01:16:21,510 --> 01:16:23,610
But that's the only sign,
a little life that we saw.

1675
01:16:24,050 --> 01:16:28,740
Whoa.
And so we camped and tyler's all fraught

1676
01:16:28,770 --> 01:16:31,590
because he's got this.
I thought this would work out.

1677
01:16:31,591 --> 01:16:35,050
It was his spot wasn't my spot.
And uh,

1678
01:16:36,420 --> 01:16:41,420
the next morning we get up and just 
stare at this hillside.

1679
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:47,000
Kaylee leaves to go take a shit.
And yeah,

1680
01:16:47,460 --> 01:16:48,293
four hours later there's a buck crosses 
and I can't get a range on my range 

1681
01:16:51,901 --> 01:16:54,930
finder.
It's too far away and I'm just pissed at

1682
01:16:54,931 --> 01:16:57,450
the whole situation.
Kyler comes over and he's like,

1683
01:16:57,451 --> 01:16:58,380
hey,
I found some deer,

1684
01:16:59,250 --> 01:17:00,083
and uh,
we slipped around and in this tiny 

1685
01:17:05,580 --> 01:17:10,010
little you had to be there.
It something you could see

1686
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:10,843
from two miles away.
You had to like stumble into this 

1687
01:17:13,071 --> 01:17:16,610
pocket.
There were seven bucks chasing one doe,

1688
01:17:17,330 --> 01:17:19,160
seven year old yearbooks,
Jason Window,

1689
01:17:19,250 --> 01:17:23,960
and we're looking at these deer and we 
were so far in it.

1690
01:17:24,470 --> 01:17:27,180
Typically you're just not going to shoot
a buck for me.

1691
01:17:27,181 --> 01:17:32,181
When you're that far in m and a,

1692
01:17:32,850 --> 01:17:34,230
when you mean when you say a buck for 
me,

1693
01:17:34,231 --> 01:17:38,040
you mean a small book.
A smaller book is you've put out so much

1694
01:17:38,041 --> 01:17:39,720
effort,
you would like to get an older,

1695
01:17:39,721 --> 01:17:44,721
mature animal when you're that far in 
the course kind of exceptionally.

1696
01:17:45,070 --> 01:17:46,230
Right.
Exactly.

1697
01:17:46,231 --> 01:17:47,670
But for people to,
for the uninitiated,

1698
01:17:47,671 --> 01:17:50,130
which a lot of people listening to this 
are that meet buck,

1699
01:17:50,131 --> 01:17:53,490
you would think of like a young fork.
Buck doesn't have big antlers.

1700
01:17:53,670 --> 01:17:54,503
So you're talking about you're looking 
for a big mature animal looking for a 

1701
01:17:56,651 --> 01:17:58,980
big contract animal,
which is a difficult challenge.

1702
01:17:58,981 --> 01:18:01,110
It's,
there's a lot involved in an animal like

1703
01:18:01,111 --> 01:18:03,510
that and it's also an animal that most 
certainly as bread,

1704
01:18:04,010 --> 01:18:04,843
yes,
spreads genes and so it's a good animal 

1705
01:18:06,751 --> 01:18:10,080
to take out of the gene pool to allow 
other animals to also breed

1706
01:18:10,170 --> 01:18:11,003
and in fact this is the only dear only 
buck in that group that was going the 

1707
01:18:14,251 --> 01:18:17,790
complete opposite direction,
so everybody else,

1708
01:18:17,791 --> 01:18:18,624
all his buddies were on that doe 
following her and he was gone the 

1709
01:18:23,730 --> 01:18:25,410
opposite direction.
Smart.

1710
01:18:25,470 --> 01:18:26,610
He's like,
listen bitch,

1711
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:28,740
I ain't got no time for these fucking 
games.

1712
01:18:28,741 --> 01:18:30,810
You find me hooker.
Good luck.

1713
01:18:31,390 --> 01:18:32,223
Good luck,
honey.

1714
01:18:32,630 --> 01:18:33,463
Yeah,
it would probably fucking drove his 

1715
01:18:34,830 --> 01:18:35,663
Ferrari over the top of the hill,
seal it and my whip be over here in my 

1716
01:18:39,031 --> 01:18:42,570
mansion and a man.
I had this thing dead to right.

1717
01:18:42,780 --> 01:18:47,780
I mean a shot I can make any day of the 
week and I missed that thing at 90 yards

1718
01:18:48,181 --> 01:18:49,540
with a rifle.
Did you punch?

1719
01:18:49,700 --> 01:18:51,420
Was it offhand?
Oh No.

1720
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:55,830
I have a beautiful rest at no excuses 
and I just lost your trigger.

1721
01:18:55,831 --> 01:18:57,630
Shit,
man.

1722
01:18:57,680 --> 01:18:59,450
Don't know.
I know exactly.

1723
01:18:59,460 --> 01:19:00,300
I mean,
I had,

1724
01:19:01,330 --> 01:19:02,163
I mean it was,
I've been in this situation a lot like 

1725
01:19:04,270 --> 01:19:05,310
okay,
fears,

1726
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:07,980
undercover,
he's going to step into this opening.

1727
01:19:08,670 --> 01:19:12,600
I had had a round in the chamber finger 
was off the trigger.

1728
01:19:12,601 --> 01:19:14,790
I was just waiting for him to step into 
that opening.

1729
01:19:14,791 --> 01:19:17,970
Cross hairs were there.
As soon as his nose came into the scope,

1730
01:19:17,971 --> 01:19:20,810
I pulled the trigger and went right in 
front of them.

1731
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:21,673
Yep.
Oh,

1732
01:19:21,770 --> 01:19:22,920
you panicked.
Oh,

1733
01:19:22,921 --> 01:19:26,610
I've lost it because he was just,
you saw those antlers.

1734
01:19:27,180 --> 01:19:28,013
I just,
I never even looked at the buck through 

1735
01:19:30,061 --> 01:19:34,230
my binoculars because I knew.
I just knew how big it was.

1736
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:35,730
How big,
how do you think he was?

1737
01:19:35,790 --> 01:19:37,380
If you had to guess,
like inches wise?

1738
01:19:37,530 --> 01:19:38,363
I would say once in two lifetimes.
Like I will never see a deer like a to 

1739
01:19:41,971 --> 01:19:42,804
90.
It was like one of those Arizona's trip 

1740
01:19:45,361 --> 01:19:47,370
bucks for me.
Yes.

1741
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:48,421
For me,
yes.

1742
01:19:48,421 --> 01:19:52,700
But I would say it was well over over 
well over the 2:20

1743
01:19:52,710 --> 01:19:53,620
mark was wasn't my

1744
01:19:53,910 --> 01:19:56,160
for people don't know what that means.
That's a,

1745
01:19:56,400 --> 01:20:00,090
that's like me with my arms out.
Like that's how big the antlers are.

1746
01:20:01,100 --> 01:20:05,850
If you see that thing,
that is that there should be a lot of.

1747
01:20:06,420 --> 01:20:08,100
For me,
there's a of misery and seeing that

1748
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:08,933
thing for it should be a,
a major pat on the back because that's 

1749
01:20:12,991 --> 01:20:14,730
just something nobody gets to see.
Yeah.

1750
01:20:14,731 --> 01:20:15,690
It's super rare,
right.

1751
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:19,440
To for them to get that big.
That's genetics age.

1752
01:20:19,820 --> 01:20:22,920
That's a wise animal.
There's a lot involved certainly in that

1753
01:20:22,921 --> 01:20:24,030
unit.
Yes.

1754
01:20:24,510 --> 01:20:25,343
Yeah.
I mean it was just so over the counter 

1755
01:20:27,361 --> 01:20:28,340
unit.
Yep.

1756
01:20:28,570 --> 01:20:31,310
Which means that for people,
the uninitiated,

1757
01:20:31,350 --> 01:20:32,350
you just.
You don't.

1758
01:20:32,610 --> 01:20:35,550
For a lot of places like where I just 
said the Arizona Strip,

1759
01:20:35,551 --> 01:20:36,384
the Arizona Strip is like this legendary
area that borders between Utah and 

1760
01:20:39,391 --> 01:20:40,224
Arizona and it has these monster mule 
deer and it like every year they pull 

1761
01:20:44,381 --> 01:20:47,400
these just insane deer out.
They've got over 300 inches,

1762
01:20:47,401 --> 01:20:51,810
which is just,
it's like the one 10th of one percent of

1763
01:20:51,811 --> 01:20:52,644
the world's population of deer.
It's just so rare to see an animal this 

1764
01:20:56,521 --> 01:20:59,760
big and this one area consistently 
produces these animals,

1765
01:20:59,761 --> 01:21:02,790
so it's really hard to get a tag there 
really hard.

1766
01:21:02,790 --> 01:21:05,490
Like you could put it in for 20 years 
and still not get it.

1767
01:21:05,700 --> 01:21:09,150
What that means is there might be 
thousands and thousands of people.

1768
01:21:09,151 --> 01:21:09,984
They are.
There are thousands of people that have 

1769
01:21:11,191 --> 01:21:15,480
putting in for a tag there and they 
might pick a very small amount.

1770
01:21:15,540 --> 01:21:16,890
Very,
very small amount.

1771
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:19,710
Yes.
So this was like an animal for there and

1772
01:21:19,711 --> 01:21:21,000
this is something like,
like I said,

1773
01:21:21,001 --> 01:21:23,070
no excuses.
We shoot a ton.

1774
01:21:23,071 --> 01:21:24,990
We have a reloading bench in the 
basement.

1775
01:21:25,020 --> 01:21:27,000
We shoot our bows in the basement of the
office.

1776
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:28,193
We have multiple shooting facilities 
that we can go to within 15 minutes of 

1777
01:21:32,581 --> 01:21:35,190
the office.
Spend a ton of time behind the trigger.

1778
01:21:35,310 --> 01:21:37,470
Do you have a process that you do in 
your mind,

1779
01:21:37,710 --> 01:21:39,600
like when you see an animal in your 
about to pull the trigger?

1780
01:21:39,601 --> 01:21:41,820
Do you have like a thing that you do?
Yeah,

1781
01:21:42,010 --> 01:21:44,040
because they say that that's a good 
thing to have.

1782
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:49,040
Like almost like a mantra for our trade 
like that more you do it,

1783
01:21:49,231 --> 01:21:50,064
the better you are.
Like the way you take care Arrow out of 

1784
01:21:51,931 --> 01:21:53,940
the quiver,
the way you put it on the string,

1785
01:21:53,970 --> 01:21:58,020
like you want that to be.
If fewer just gripped,

1786
01:21:58,050 --> 01:21:59,520
right?
It just happens.

1787
01:21:59,670 --> 01:22:02,970
Exactly like fighting.
I'd say that same exact thing,

1788
01:22:03,030 --> 01:22:03,863
same exact thing.
You're dealing with anxiety and having 

1789
01:22:05,911 --> 01:22:10,911
this pattern that you've carved so 
deeply into your mind and your body,

1790
01:22:12,111 --> 01:22:15,510
your neurons that your body just knows 
automatically.

1791
01:22:15,830 --> 01:22:16,663
Like when I was competing,
there was moments where I did something 

1792
01:22:19,111 --> 01:22:19,944
where I didn't even know I did it and it
was already basically don't even 

1793
01:22:23,191 --> 01:22:24,024
remember what the hell you're just 
moving on this total reaction and 

1794
01:22:27,331 --> 01:22:28,164
training.
Yeah.

1795
01:22:28,300 --> 01:22:29,133
You know,
and for a archers that moment like you 

1796
01:22:32,341 --> 01:22:36,480
have to kind of like carve that path 
also because like if you're,

1797
01:22:36,630 --> 01:22:37,463
if you're fighting,
you get to spar a lot so you get to hit 

1798
01:22:40,171 --> 01:22:41,100
people a lot.

1799
01:22:41,100 --> 01:22:43,860
You get used to the idea of moving away 
and hitting someone.

1800
01:22:44,070 --> 01:22:46,050
But how often do you get to shoot an 
animal?

1801
01:22:46,260 --> 01:22:46,980
Right?
I mean,

1802
01:22:46,980 --> 01:22:51,060
it's really rare when I shoot one,
like maybe once a six months,

1803
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:53,280
you know,
once a once a year.

1804
01:22:53,281 --> 01:22:55,530
If you're a busy person,
if you're lucky,

1805
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:56,673
maybe you go a year and you don't even 
get a shot at one because you don't to 

1806
01:22:58,710 --> 01:23:01,420
maybe get this one trip a year and like 
what,

1807
01:23:01,740 --> 01:23:02,573
you know,
you go somewhere and like you were 

1808
01:23:03,601 --> 01:23:04,434
saying,
you didn't see anything until you saw 

1809
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:06,040
that fond.
That could have been the

1810
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:06,873
whole trip.
Could have been the happens all the 

1811
01:23:08,141 --> 01:23:08,950
time.
You Go,

1812
01:23:08,950 --> 01:23:11,710
you'll be an outfit for days and days 
and days you don't see a goddamn thing.

1813
01:23:11,711 --> 01:23:14,800
And then next year comes along and then 
next year sucks too.

1814
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:16,810
And then the year after that you finally
get her shot.

1815
01:23:16,830 --> 01:23:18,050
Knowing Jesus,
your,

1816
01:23:18,130 --> 01:23:21,100
your whole body's just wracked with 
anticipation and nerves.

1817
01:23:21,101 --> 01:23:23,650
And I've seen people where their legs 
are shaking,

1818
01:23:23,651 --> 01:23:26,140
their arms are shaking.
Like I've seen videos where guys hunting

1819
01:23:26,141 --> 01:23:29,440
elk where you see their arms shaking as 
they're pulling back.

1820
01:23:29,620 --> 01:23:31,730
Their bodies just jacked with 
adrenaline.

1821
01:23:31,731 --> 01:23:35,470
It doesn't change and they just try to 
keep that pen in the general area.

1822
01:23:35,471 --> 01:23:38,440
That animal pull through the shot.
For those of you who don't know,

1823
01:23:38,441 --> 01:23:42,310
this is like stepping into a place that 
you have never been before.

1824
01:23:42,700 --> 01:23:43,533
You're not sure what's going on and you 
whistle and a six to 800 pound animal 

1825
01:23:51,021 --> 01:23:51,854
with big chunks of shirt bone coming out
of its head and it's dick slapping 

1826
01:23:56,981 --> 01:23:59,440
against the belly,
literally piss all over the place,

1827
01:23:59,441 --> 01:24:00,274
wants to come in and either mount you 
from behind or beat the piss out of you 

1828
01:24:04,120 --> 01:24:04,953
or stab you with his antlers.
It's a forest horse with swords growing 

1829
01:24:07,931 --> 01:24:09,420
out of his head.
I mean,

1830
01:24:09,430 --> 01:24:09,880
it's,
it's.

1831
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:12,640
These are,
they're amazing and you freak out,

1832
01:24:12,641 --> 01:24:14,230
man.
It is.

1833
01:24:14,231 --> 01:24:18,010
But a one every five.
If you're an archery hunter,

1834
01:24:18,011 --> 01:24:21,820
once one bowl every five years or one 
successful,

1835
01:24:23,010 --> 01:24:23,843
uh,

1836
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:24,913
season in five is the national average.
That's why Kim Haines is such a freak 

1837
01:24:29,450 --> 01:24:31,850
because he has not been a,
he's,

1838
01:24:31,880 --> 01:24:36,880
he hasn't been unsuccessful on an 
archery hunt since 2009.

1839
01:24:38,270 --> 01:24:42,200
And the guy goes many times a year,
how many times a year,

1840
01:24:42,370 --> 01:24:45,740
but all the ultra marathon running and 
all the weightlifting,

1841
01:24:45,830 --> 01:24:48,740
all the crazy shit he does and constant 
practice with archery.

1842
01:24:49,130 --> 01:24:51,650
He just like when the moments come,
he's the.

1843
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:54,890
He's so dialed in,
he's so ready to go.

1844
01:24:54,891 --> 01:24:56,300
It's really,
really impressive.

1845
01:24:56,590 --> 01:24:57,080
You know,
I mean,

1846
01:24:57,080 --> 01:24:57,913
I don't think people understand.
So when I see people on his instagram 

1847
01:25:01,341 --> 01:25:04,160
page takes new school,
what you're doing is you're a coward.

1848
01:25:04,161 --> 01:25:06,060
Why don't you fight that thing 
hand-to-hand,

1849
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:08,420
like you have no idea what you're 
looking at.

1850
01:25:08,490 --> 01:25:11,390
One 10th of one percent of all the 
hunters,

1851
01:25:11,420 --> 01:25:12,740
that's what that guy is.
He's the,

1852
01:25:12,980 --> 01:25:15,740
he's the one 10th of one percent of the 
hunters.

1853
01:25:16,070 --> 01:25:16,903
And he's out there being way more 
successful than anybody else doing 

1854
01:25:20,781 --> 01:25:21,614
something that's insanely difficult.
But to the uninitiated or the people 

1855
01:25:23,931 --> 01:25:27,470
that just have never experienced it,
it looks like he's a animal.

1856
01:25:27,471 --> 01:25:31,070
Hating monster was out there shooting 
God's beautiful creations,

1857
01:25:31,160 --> 01:25:34,740
right?
Sometimes Brian and I'll go hunting with

1858
01:25:35,190 --> 01:25:39,660
military guys will come out and I'm back
to the.

1859
01:25:39,720 --> 01:25:42,450
Just having the process.
It's the craziest thing,

1860
01:25:42,451 --> 01:25:44,910
guys that are really good at this,
you know,

1861
01:25:44,911 --> 01:25:45,744
and it's like,
it's almost like a robotic action when 

1862
01:25:48,661 --> 01:25:50,730
it's go time.
It's like sit there,

1863
01:25:50,731 --> 01:25:51,990
pack down,
you know,

1864
01:25:51,991 --> 01:25:52,824
just,
it's pretty wild to watch somebody 

1865
01:25:54,211 --> 01:25:56,100
that's,
that so practiced at that,

1866
01:25:56,101 --> 01:25:57,000
you know,
the way they load,

1867
01:25:57,001 --> 01:25:59,090
the way they reload on target,
on glass like it,

1868
01:25:59,091 --> 01:26:00,270
it's,
it's,

1869
01:26:00,330 --> 01:26:01,440
it's amazing.
You know,

1870
01:26:01,441 --> 01:26:03,900
and you see true pros at,
you know,

1871
01:26:04,090 --> 01:26:04,923
well that's a totally different world 
when you have to shoot people and 

1872
01:26:07,271 --> 01:26:10,250
they're trying to shoot you to think of 
the anticipation.

1873
01:26:10,251 --> 01:26:13,010
The anxiety is involved in shooting a 
beautiful deer like you missed.

1874
01:26:13,310 --> 01:26:18,170
Now imagine that's some urine,
some foreign land and this is some enemy

1875
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:21,170
guy that you're engaging with and he's 
trying to kill you and you know,

1876
01:26:21,171 --> 01:26:24,320
like you ain't gotta be.
I mean that's where legit.

1877
01:26:24,321 --> 01:26:26,620
Like that's one of the interesting.
Do you know Joel Turner's?

1878
01:26:27,310 --> 01:26:30,410
I do.
Joel Turner has a whole series on target

1879
01:26:30,411 --> 01:26:32,690
panic for archery.
It's really interesting.

1880
01:26:32,691 --> 01:26:36,740
It's an online series.
What was it called?

1881
01:26:37,660 --> 01:26:38,493
Something.
See if he could find the name of 

1882
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:41,460
traditional.
Yes,

1883
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:43,760
yes.
A like Denver.

1884
01:26:43,761 --> 01:26:46,460
Maybe something like,
I'm not sure where he's out of,

1885
01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:50,110
but it's an instinct fighting instinct 
or something like that.

1886
01:26:50,250 --> 01:26:54,240
No iron mind guy.
Yes.

1887
01:26:54,490 --> 01:26:55,323
Closed loop,
open loop guy and he's got this whole 

1888
01:26:58,950 --> 01:27:03,090
system that he's put together and I 
actually paid for it and wash it.

1889
01:27:03,091 --> 01:27:05,130
Very good stuff.
Very well thought out.

1890
01:27:05,131 --> 01:27:05,964
Very interesting stuff.
But a lot of it is on the mindset 

1891
01:27:07,081 --> 01:27:10,020
because he was a.
He was training police officers.

1892
01:27:10,330 --> 01:27:15,330
He's training like Swat team members and
how to keep it together in the middle of

1893
01:27:15,361 --> 01:27:16,194
a firefight.
And he actually was talking in one of 

1894
01:27:18,751 --> 01:27:19,584
the interviews that I saw him in about a
conversation that he had with a police 

1895
01:27:23,611 --> 01:27:27,990
officer that was in a firefight with a 
bad guy and heard this,

1896
01:27:28,110 --> 01:27:28,943
heard his words and his instructions 
going through an executed correctly and 

1897
01:27:31,861 --> 01:27:35,070
did the right thing while this guy's 
shooting in his car window and glass was

1898
01:27:35,071 --> 01:27:38,310
flying and bullets are flying at him and
he stayed calm and killed.

1899
01:27:38,311 --> 01:27:40,530
This guy was shooting at him.
But that,

1900
01:27:40,850 --> 01:27:45,480
um,
that this process of having a thing that

1901
01:27:45,481 --> 01:27:46,314
you like,
a mantra that you relay into your head 

1902
01:27:47,521 --> 01:27:51,120
that relates to a physical action and 
that you drill it in yourself.

1903
01:27:51,121 --> 01:27:53,250
So it's like,
it's unavoidable.

1904
01:27:53,251 --> 01:27:54,330
Like this is how you do things.

1905
01:27:55,650 --> 01:27:56,483
That situation.
We described what the bowl coming in 

1906
01:27:58,711 --> 01:28:00,250
like,
yeah,

1907
01:28:00,270 --> 01:28:02,970
you shake your head goes a million miles
an hour.

1908
01:28:03,020 --> 01:28:05,700
Like if you don't have something to fall
back on,

1909
01:28:05,730 --> 01:28:09,290
the odds of you making a mistake I feel 
are way higher than you.

1910
01:28:09,570 --> 01:28:10,760
Successful.
Yeah.

1911
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:11,753
Yeah.
You gotta there's gotTa be a thing in 

1912
01:28:13,261 --> 01:28:16,440
your brain that you can like press play 
on,

1913
01:28:16,890 --> 01:28:19,470
you know.
And then once you do that you could like

1914
01:28:19,471 --> 01:28:22,020
there was an article that I read 
recently about a,

1915
01:28:22,021 --> 01:28:22,854
it was about choking and sports and it 
was essentially there's the article was 

1916
01:28:27,031 --> 01:28:27,864
essentially saying that what you have to
do is figure out a process that removes 

1917
01:28:31,891 --> 01:28:32,724
your conscious mind from the equation.
Like figure out a process of training 

1918
01:28:36,660 --> 01:28:37,980
where you know what to do.
Like someone's,

1919
01:28:38,020 --> 01:28:39,810
you have a basketball,
someone's coming at you,

1920
01:28:39,811 --> 01:28:41,190
you juke left.
You go right.

1921
01:28:41,310 --> 01:28:42,143
You know how to do this,
you've done it so many times that this 

1922
01:28:43,621 --> 01:28:44,454
is just a natural reaction and get it to
the point where you don't have to think 

1923
01:28:46,981 --> 01:28:50,850
about it so you're not overwhelmed by 
this moment in the anticipation of,

1924
01:28:50,851 --> 01:28:52,380
what if I fuck this up?
Oh my God,

1925
01:28:52,381 --> 01:28:54,390
so many people are watching what happens
here.

1926
01:28:54,391 --> 01:28:55,224
What if I do that and you'll.
You'll see those moments where people 

1927
01:28:57,511 --> 01:29:01,860
just lock up and they panic.
You see seen in fighting all the time.

1928
01:29:02,510 --> 01:29:07,500
The tradco thing versus a compound or 
recurve,

1929
01:29:07,501 --> 01:29:09,800
right?
That introduces.

1930
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:13,860
That's when this shit can get crazy 
because say with the compound,

1931
01:29:13,861 --> 01:29:15,360
you draw back,
you hit the wall,

1932
01:29:15,390 --> 01:29:17,310
right?
The bow only drawback so far.

1933
01:29:17,340 --> 01:29:19,410
You look through a whole,
you'd let it up with another whole.

1934
01:29:19,670 --> 01:29:20,550
I mean,
don't get me wrong,

1935
01:29:20,551 --> 01:29:22,770
it's no picnic,
but then you know,

1936
01:29:22,890 --> 01:29:26,890
once you start shooting in traditional,
there's nothing that's super repeatable.

1937
01:29:26,891 --> 01:29:27,724
I mean you try to do it,
but you pull it back as far or if you 

1938
01:29:30,871 --> 01:29:32,400
don't pull back far enough,
you goof up.

1939
01:29:32,430 --> 01:29:33,263
You know what I mean?
There's no aiming and it's a funny 

1940
01:29:35,911 --> 01:29:36,744
experience when all the sudden,
the first time you draw back on anime 

1941
01:29:38,841 --> 01:29:39,674
and you're like,
what the hell is go like there's no 

1942
01:29:41,791 --> 01:29:42,870
reference,
right?

1943
01:29:42,871 --> 01:29:44,760
Your brain is just kind of bouncing 
around.

1944
01:29:44,761 --> 01:29:46,650
And I think where that,
uh,

1945
01:29:46,680 --> 01:29:48,600
what was the guy's name?
Joel Turner.

1946
01:29:48,650 --> 01:29:49,890
Yeah.
Where he is just.

1947
01:29:50,730 --> 01:29:54,090
And he shoots with us some loop.
He shoots Mongol Scott,

1948
01:29:54,530 --> 01:29:58,140
you know,
Mongol style is the Mongols used to have

1949
01:29:58,141 --> 01:30:00,450
a thumb ring.
They would have a bone ring.

1950
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:01,313
I've seen it.
They would wear around their thumb and 

1951
01:30:02,521 --> 01:30:04,800
that's what would fit on the groove of 
the string.

1952
01:30:05,010 --> 01:30:05,843
So they'd hook the string with their 
thumb and then close their index finger 

1953
01:30:08,161 --> 01:30:10,560
over it and they would draw back like 
this.

1954
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:13,830
And according to Dan Carlin from,
if you've never heard this before,

1955
01:30:13,831 --> 01:30:15,150
if you've heard me rant about this 
before,

1956
01:30:15,151 --> 01:30:17,070
I'm sorry,
just ignore me for a moment.

1957
01:30:17,790 --> 01:30:19,830
There's a,
there's a amazing,

1958
01:30:20,220 --> 01:30:23,220
a podcast series called hardcore 
history.

1959
01:30:23,221 --> 01:30:25,580
It's by this guy who's a friend of mine.
His name's Dan Carlin's,

1960
01:30:25,581 --> 01:30:29,320
says genius historian who's so good at 
relaying.

1961
01:30:29,370 --> 01:30:30,720
He'll,
he'll say he's not a historian.

1962
01:30:30,721 --> 01:30:32,520
He definitely is,
he's super humble guy,

1963
01:30:32,640 --> 01:30:33,473
but he's so good at relaying information
in an entertaining and dramatic fashion 

1964
01:30:39,211 --> 01:30:43,950
and he has a series called the wrath of 
the Khan and it's a five part series.

1965
01:30:44,160 --> 01:30:45,870
You have to pay for it now.
Um,

1966
01:30:46,020 --> 01:30:48,450
but it's like a dollar an episode.
It's so worth it.

1967
01:30:48,451 --> 01:30:49,284
It's worth 100 times more than that,
but it's a five part episode on the 

1968
01:30:52,081 --> 01:30:52,914
Mongols.
And he said that their bows were like 

1969
01:30:54,001 --> 01:30:54,834
160 pounds raw.
They were just these sinewy fucking 

1970
01:30:57,451 --> 01:31:00,450
savages that were incredible archers 
that were.

1971
01:31:00,660 --> 01:31:01,493
They had developed this ability to 
release the Arrow as the horse was in 

1972
01:31:04,741 --> 01:31:05,574
its Gallup.
So when the horse was in the air where 

1973
01:31:07,291 --> 01:31:08,124
there wasn't a disturbance,
so they would time the release of the 

1974
01:31:10,321 --> 01:31:13,230
Arrow to when the horse was actually in 
the air force.

1975
01:31:13,470 --> 01:31:14,303
They had it down and the had a thumb 
ring and that's how they would draw 

1976
01:31:17,581 --> 01:31:18,840
back.
So not with your fingers,

1977
01:31:18,841 --> 01:31:19,674
like most people do.
They would draw back with the thumb 

1978
01:31:21,540 --> 01:31:23,580
loop,
the index finger over the thumb.

1979
01:31:23,581 --> 01:31:26,850
And for some reason they found that to 
be a better method day.

1980
01:31:26,890 --> 01:31:28,060
It's like a,
it's like a,

1981
01:31:28,450 --> 01:31:30,340
you know,
it's like a primitive release.

1982
01:31:30,370 --> 01:31:31,920
That's the thing with the traffic,
right?

1983
01:31:31,930 --> 01:31:33,520
Your fingers,
you can pluck,

1984
01:31:33,521 --> 01:31:35,560
you can just hit 100 different ways to 
screw up.

1985
01:31:35,730 --> 01:31:37,570
Right?
If you had that right,

1986
01:31:37,571 --> 01:31:39,760
you let go.
It's probably a lot more consistent.

1987
01:31:40,740 --> 01:31:41,573
Well that's the whole,
the other is you could see that that's 

1988
01:31:42,860 --> 01:31:47,460
the bone thumb rings and a lot of people
like to shoot that way.

1989
01:31:47,461 --> 01:31:48,294
Now.
It's really kind of interesting stuff 

1990
01:31:50,371 --> 01:31:51,660
man.
And see how it holds.

1991
01:31:51,661 --> 01:31:56,661
And then you throw your finger over the 
top of that thumb ring and you know,

1992
01:31:56,821 --> 01:31:57,654
your,
your thumb pushes back on it and you 

1993
01:31:58,980 --> 01:32:01,540
need your finger,
your index finger closes over the top of

1994
01:32:01,541 --> 01:32:04,420
your thumb.
It's not dissimilar to a lot,

1995
01:32:04,660 --> 01:32:06,550
to a release a lot of ways.
Yeah.

1996
01:32:07,210 --> 01:32:07,900
Like,
um,

1997
01:32:07,900 --> 01:32:10,990
when I shoot a compound bow,
I shoot a,

1998
01:32:10,991 --> 01:32:14,500
I use a Carter release thumb trigger 
release.

1999
01:32:14,501 --> 01:32:18,520
It's a good tension is I use one called 
the wise choice.

2000
01:32:18,550 --> 01:32:19,383
It's,
um,

2001
01:32:19,570 --> 01:32:21,510
but I use attention based one to the 
evolution,

2002
01:32:21,511 --> 01:32:22,344
or is one that John Dudley put out 
called the silver back that are really 

2003
01:32:24,271 --> 01:32:25,150
prepped.
Hurry up.

2004
01:32:25,410 --> 01:32:26,180
Go.
No,

2005
01:32:26,180 --> 01:32:26,831
no,
no,

2006
01:32:26,831 --> 01:32:29,610
it doesn't because it's the same motion.
You know,

2007
01:32:29,620 --> 01:32:32,560
the idea is you don't ever pull the 
trigger.

2008
01:32:32,830 --> 01:32:34,210
You,
you lock in,

2009
01:32:34,211 --> 01:32:36,370
you pull in place.
You put your thumb over the trigger.

2010
01:32:36,520 --> 01:32:37,353
Then once you're in place,
you concentrate on the muscles that are 

2011
01:32:38,921 --> 01:32:39,754
in the center of your back and you pull 
those and the release goes off and you 

2012
01:32:42,491 --> 01:32:45,460
get a surprise shot.
So the idea behind that is there's never

2013
01:32:45,461 --> 01:32:50,080
a moment in your life now and you punch 
it and then you move the Arrow where you

2014
01:32:50,081 --> 01:32:50,914
move the boats or did I get it?
I know there's all that shit is out of 

2015
01:32:53,201 --> 01:32:54,034
your head because all you're doing in 
the shot process is pulling and 

2016
01:32:57,101 --> 01:33:00,760
concentrating on those muscles and the 
center of your back and your scapula and

2017
01:33:00,761 --> 01:33:02,470
contracting those.
And as you do that,

2018
01:33:02,471 --> 01:33:03,304
they released just goes off because your
thumb is pressing against that trigger 

2019
01:33:06,040 --> 01:33:06,630
and it just goes.

2020
01:33:06,630 --> 01:33:07,463
And.
But you have to resist that urge that 

2021
01:33:08,951 --> 01:33:09,784
everybody has just now now punching.
So that's the difference between like 

2022
01:33:13,630 --> 01:33:16,810
John Dudley's approach versus Joel 
[inaudible] approach like John Doe,

2023
01:33:16,870 --> 01:33:17,703
Joel Turner has the same approach and 
even talks about it when it comes to 

2024
01:33:21,340 --> 01:33:25,840
compound bows of using a thumb trigger 
of polling and letting you know,

2025
01:33:25,841 --> 01:33:29,650
letting the shot go off automatically.
But Dudley,

2026
01:33:30,310 --> 01:33:33,850
he thinks that you should start off 
using attention based release,

2027
01:33:34,120 --> 01:33:36,900
which the way that works is you actually
hold the safety,

2028
01:33:36,910 --> 01:33:39,130
hold the trigger until you lock in 
place.

2029
01:33:39,140 --> 01:33:41,320
Then once you're ready to execute your 
release,

2030
01:33:41,321 --> 01:33:42,154
the safety and all it takes is like a 
couple extra pounds of pulling and it 

2031
01:33:44,981 --> 01:33:46,390
goes off.
Interesting.

2032
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:48,850
Yeah.
So it's like a Carter evolution or he.

2033
01:33:48,870 --> 01:33:52,930
He has one that he makes called the 
silver back that is a two finger version

2034
01:33:52,931 --> 01:33:53,764
of the Carter evolution.
So he feels like the least amount of 

2035
01:33:55,961 --> 01:33:57,100
fingers that you have on it.

2036
01:33:57,130 --> 01:33:57,963
The least amount of tension.
I mean this is the point to try to do 

2037
01:34:00,390 --> 01:34:01,840
people like what the fuck are you 
rambling about?

2038
01:34:02,380 --> 01:34:04,120
What I'm trying to randomly about like 
this,

2039
01:34:04,121 --> 01:34:04,954
this thing is insanely complicated,
so to the people that look at this and 

2040
01:34:09,341 --> 01:34:10,270
say,
oh,

2041
01:34:10,271 --> 01:34:11,104
there's no skill involved and Oh,
you're just killing this defenseless 

2042
01:34:13,391 --> 01:34:17,530
animal like is the most difficult way to
get your food.

2043
01:34:18,130 --> 01:34:19,990
Yes.
It's the most difficult way.

2044
01:34:20,110 --> 01:34:23,470
There's no more difficult way to get 
your food than shooting an animal with a

2045
01:34:23,471 --> 01:34:24,304
bow and arrow.
It doesn't exist unless you want to 

2046
01:34:25,961 --> 01:34:27,820
fucking use a spear.
I make.

2047
01:34:27,850 --> 01:34:28,683
I guess it is not getting growth.
I guess you could to jump out of a tree 

2048
01:34:31,211 --> 01:34:32,200
with a knife and.
Yeah,

2049
01:34:32,610 --> 01:34:35,540
but that stupid mean,
but it is that,

2050
01:34:35,541 --> 01:34:37,270
you know,
the animal comes for your strategy.

2051
01:34:37,550 --> 01:34:42,550
Like for me it fit is proficient and 
proven.

2052
01:34:42,701 --> 01:34:43,534
Be Proficient.
When Kevin and I were making the switch 

2053
01:34:45,011 --> 01:34:48,580
to go back to traditional archery.
Why'd you guys decide to do that?

2054
01:34:49,180 --> 01:34:51,820
Man,
I got so tired of the stuff.

2055
01:34:52,380 --> 01:34:54,160
Yeah,
like tough stuff.

2056
01:34:54,161 --> 01:34:56,020
Changing every year.
New Sites,

2057
01:34:56,050 --> 01:34:57,750
new strings this new.

2058
01:34:58,090 --> 01:35:01,780
I got to hate,
hate setting up a compound bow.

2059
01:35:01,781 --> 01:35:03,010
I hated it.
Why?

2060
01:35:03,190 --> 01:35:05,920
Because there's just so much going on 
and like,

2061
01:35:05,921 --> 01:35:07,270
Oh man,
is that me?

2062
01:35:07,330 --> 01:35:09,190
Or is the bowl out of tune,
did my string stretch

2063
01:35:09,670 --> 01:35:13,380
timing and twisting your strings and how
I'm going back

2064
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:14,870
this year,
I'm going to get a job.

2065
01:35:14,970 --> 01:35:16,670
I like to cows point plus.

2066
01:35:16,740 --> 01:35:19,410
What are you going back to traditional?
Are you going back to compound

2067
01:35:19,790 --> 01:35:20,623
back to compound a company is making a 
called [inaudible] really nice bose and 

2068
01:35:24,891 --> 01:35:25,970
our camouflage pattern.
I'm,

2069
01:35:26,090 --> 01:35:27,410
I'm pretty excited.
And plus,

2070
01:35:27,411 --> 01:35:28,140
I don't know.
I,

2071
01:35:28,140 --> 01:35:31,310
I,
I've had very mixed success.

2072
01:35:31,370 --> 01:35:33,200
I would say I struggled a little bit.
Yeah,

2073
01:35:33,201 --> 01:35:34,110
I'm sure.
Um,

2074
01:35:34,280 --> 01:35:36,950
but how could you not but the um,
but the,

2075
01:35:37,100 --> 01:35:41,180
but frankly that the simplicity of it is
so appealing.

2076
01:35:41,181 --> 01:35:42,530
You know what I mean?
It's,

2077
01:35:42,590 --> 01:35:44,240
it's fantastic,
right?

2078
01:35:44,241 --> 01:35:47,150
Versus setting everything up and plus,
you know,

2079
01:35:47,160 --> 01:35:49,490
you get to a point where a modern 
compound bow,

2080
01:35:49,491 --> 01:35:52,250
if you practice a lot meaning for years,
right,

2081
01:35:52,280 --> 01:35:53,113
you,
you'll get to 90 yards to where you are 

2082
01:35:56,270 --> 01:35:58,650
professional day.
People are going to complain and I don't

2083
01:35:58,651 --> 01:35:59,484
know,

2084
01:35:59,730 --> 01:36:00,563
it's not,
it's not really that ethical for most 

2085
01:36:02,521 --> 01:36:03,354
people to shoot at 90 yards.
But it is for a guy like John Dudley or 

2086
01:36:05,851 --> 01:36:08,130
you know,
a guy like cameron hanes because they do

2087
01:36:08,131 --> 01:36:09,080
it all day

2088
01:36:09,160 --> 01:36:09,993
first.
Grammy is a very technically proficient 

2089
01:36:12,520 --> 01:36:15,430
shooter in anything that he shoots him.
He won't say it,

2090
01:36:15,460 --> 01:36:18,940
but we used to sit in the ski area 
parking lot,

2091
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:24,000
Greyhawk parking lot and 106 yards is as
far as my adjustable site would go on my

2092
01:36:26,291 --> 01:36:27,124
bow.
So he would stand there and he could 

2093
01:36:28,451 --> 01:36:29,284
shoot a lot further.
But I mean the groups that he would put 

2094
01:36:31,061 --> 01:36:36,061
in at 106 yards were a maze because he's
got that mind to do it so he can shoot,

2095
01:36:36,820 --> 01:36:38,150
you know,
I don't know.

2096
01:36:38,590 --> 01:36:39,423
But the thing is is that after awhile 
you get to the point where I don't want 

2097
01:36:43,391 --> 01:36:48,330
to shoot something at 50 yards.
I want to shoot my next elk at 15 years.

2098
01:36:48,470 --> 01:36:51,340
So you know what I mean.
So I think that's largely it.

2099
01:36:51,341 --> 01:36:52,174
And I think without a doubt,
in the past three years I've become way 

2100
01:36:55,271 --> 01:36:56,980
better hunt.
We have been know both.

2101
01:36:57,040 --> 01:37:00,790
I mean cows killed bubble both years 
with his trad.

2102
01:37:00,850 --> 01:37:04,540
I missed a nice bowl two years ago,
but it's just hard,

2103
01:37:04,990 --> 01:37:05,823
you know,
and if nothing else you're going to get 

2104
01:37:07,001 --> 01:37:10,330
way better at hunting in the sense that 
you're going to hunt more because you're

2105
01:37:10,331 --> 01:37:12,640
not going to kill shit at first.
Right.

2106
01:37:12,641 --> 01:37:14,290
But you know,
being,

2107
01:37:14,980 --> 01:37:15,813
having to go from,
let's just say 80 is a Max yard and I 

2108
01:37:17,831 --> 01:37:19,630
don't want to get into the argument 
about distance,

2109
01:37:19,631 --> 01:37:21,050
but let's just say that was,
you know,

2110
01:37:21,060 --> 01:37:24,430
your Max Max on a perfect situation with
the compound,

2111
01:37:24,431 --> 01:37:28,870
with a compound bow down to say 25 or 30
yards.

2112
01:37:29,230 --> 01:37:30,910
It,
it's interesting.

2113
01:37:30,911 --> 01:37:34,300
It just makes you in your head just so 
much more.

2114
01:37:34,930 --> 01:37:36,700
You have to try so much harder.
You know,

2115
01:37:36,701 --> 01:37:39,640
and I don't know,
I just people that experience,

2116
01:37:39,790 --> 01:37:44,790
I have no desire whatsoever to hunt.
Even if you're a lifelong vegetarian,

2117
01:37:44,971 --> 01:37:48,660
you're never going to eat me.
Just go shoot a bone Arrow at a target.

2118
01:37:48,990 --> 01:37:53,040
It is so relaxing and some weird 
meditative way.

2119
01:37:53,041 --> 01:37:56,220
It cleanses your mind in some way.
Zen

2120
01:37:56,220 --> 01:37:57,053
stuff,
man.

2121
01:37:57,420 --> 01:37:59,190
It's like fly fish and kind of same 
thing.

2122
01:37:59,191 --> 01:38:01,620
It's like you're not necessarily.
I don't know,

2123
01:38:01,621 --> 01:38:02,454
you have to concentrate,
but at the same time it's like taking a 

2124
01:38:04,441 --> 01:38:06,570
nap or something.
You go shoot for 20 minutes,

2125
01:38:06,571 --> 01:38:07,680
30 minutes and you're done.
You're like,

2126
01:38:07,681 --> 01:38:09,270
okay,
what was I thinking about before?

2127
01:38:09,710 --> 01:38:10,321
Yeah.
Oh,

2128
01:38:10,321 --> 01:38:11,154
I love to do it.
When I've got like a business issue I'm 

2129
01:38:12,781 --> 01:38:16,140
dealing with or something I'm trying to 
like sort out in my mind.

2130
01:38:16,141 --> 01:38:19,090
I just go out in my yard.
I got a big rubber elk out there,

2131
01:38:19,150 --> 01:38:19,983
85 yards and they'll just start shooting
that sucker and you see you don't think 

2132
01:38:22,651 --> 01:38:25,680
about nothing but that shot.
He just sent her that pen.

2133
01:38:25,681 --> 01:38:27,780
Try to stay calm,
relax your hand,

2134
01:38:27,781 --> 01:38:31,140
let the Bogo off and there's no room for
anything else.

2135
01:38:31,141 --> 01:38:33,090
And then in its activities.
Yeah,

2136
01:38:33,091 --> 01:38:33,924
and you walk up there,
you pull your arrows that you walked 

2137
01:38:35,701 --> 01:38:38,130
back,
you're concentrating the whole process.

2138
01:38:38,131 --> 01:38:38,964
I don't know.
I think it's cleansing and some sort of 

2139
01:38:40,441 --> 01:38:43,140
a weird way,
and I'm not a traditional bows shooter,

2140
01:38:43,141 --> 01:38:46,710
but I would imagine that was accentuated
even further because a,

2141
01:38:46,740 --> 01:38:51,540
it's even more like instinctive that you
have that involved as well.

2142
01:38:51,720 --> 01:38:52,553
So like instead of using a site,
you're sort of like calculating in your 

2143
01:38:56,101 --> 01:38:58,620
mind the drop of the Arrow over distance

2144
01:38:59,090 --> 01:38:59,923
you can,
but it can be more frustrating to way 

2145
01:39:01,580 --> 01:39:03,310
more with the compound out.
I mean,

2146
01:39:03,350 --> 01:39:04,183
with the recurve.
I've gone out and shot two arrows and I 

2147
01:39:05,871 --> 01:39:07,010
was like,
fuck this.

2148
01:39:07,011 --> 01:39:08,120
I'm done.

2149
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:14,280
Yeah.
Ken and I are all,

2150
01:39:14,281 --> 01:39:16,200
uh,
our uh,

2151
01:39:16,740 --> 01:39:17,573
our first accountant gallery retired.
And so we all went out and had some 

2152
01:39:19,711 --> 01:39:22,430
beers with her and I was a little fuzzy 
the next morning.

2153
01:39:22,460 --> 01:39:24,330
I forgot my tags.
So,

2154
01:39:24,620 --> 01:39:25,670
uh,
I was like,

2155
01:39:25,680 --> 01:39:27,540
I'm just going to call for,
for Canada.

2156
01:39:27,720 --> 01:39:32,720
And we took off into the woods and 
called the Bolin within 20 minutes.

2157
01:39:33,330 --> 01:39:34,920
Didn't have a shot at.
Oh my gosh,

2158
01:39:34,921 --> 01:39:37,700
this is a great day.
We ended up calling in three mobile,

2159
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:42,420
three more bowls that day,
but the bowl that Kenton got a shot at,

2160
01:39:43,050 --> 01:39:43,883
um,
he would have shot four times before it 

2161
01:39:48,540 --> 01:39:51,090
ultimately came into recurve distance.

2162
01:39:51,340 --> 01:39:52,870
Right.
But it did come in.

2163
01:39:53,080 --> 01:39:53,913
It came,
I mean it was in four yards at one 

2164
01:39:55,661 --> 01:39:57,060
point.
Oh my God.

2165
01:39:57,250 --> 01:39:57,940
I mean,
it was this,

2166
01:39:57,940 --> 01:39:58,773
it was like this close.
That's so crazy to have an animal that 

2167
01:40:01,121 --> 01:40:04,870
big that close to you.
It was crazy and fed to cows point.

2168
01:40:04,871 --> 01:40:07,360
The beauty was,
was that it was hanging up out at,

2169
01:40:07,650 --> 01:40:10,600
you know,
50 yards for five minutes and that would

2170
01:40:10,601 --> 01:40:12,040
have been the end of that experience.
Right.

2171
01:40:12,270 --> 01:40:14,710
I would have not had that same 
experience.

2172
01:40:14,711 --> 01:40:19,711
And then it comes up and to count what 
it licked you basically write in cap and

2173
01:40:21,700 --> 01:40:23,450
looking through the Mesh in the back of 
my cab.

2174
01:40:24,230 --> 01:40:26,980
It's saying it's coming straight towards
me,

2175
01:40:26,981 --> 01:40:29,250
but I kind of caught me,
you know,

2176
01:40:29,290 --> 01:40:30,990
to where I didn't have a shot.
Um,

2177
01:40:31,960 --> 01:40:33,730
and then it went and looked and I missed
it out.

2178
01:40:33,870 --> 01:40:35,840
I'll never forget that.
But um,

2179
01:40:36,010 --> 01:40:38,830
but it would have been over.
The experience of having,

2180
01:40:39,250 --> 01:40:42,880
of having to get that close is really 
cool.

2181
01:40:43,260 --> 01:40:44,570
You know what I mean?
If like,

2182
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:45,633
like I said,
it would have been done and we'd have 

2183
01:40:46,571 --> 01:40:47,920
been packing it on.
It would have been cool,

2184
01:40:47,921 --> 01:40:48,754
but whatever.
And that would have been incredible to 

2185
01:40:50,441 --> 01:40:51,310
shoot it there too.
But,

2186
01:40:51,320 --> 01:40:54,850
but just to be that close and visceral 
and it's like,

2187
01:40:55,240 --> 01:40:58,480
holy smokes,
I mean this thing is here.

2188
01:40:59,080 --> 01:40:59,590
Yeah.

2189
01:40:59,590 --> 01:41:00,423
It's one of the things that um,
I talked about with Jason Harrington 

2190
01:41:04,601 --> 01:41:05,434
from we were talking about the 
difference between like mountaineering 

2191
01:41:07,871 --> 01:41:11,680
and hunting and it's like all these 
things and hiking and hunting.

2192
01:41:11,681 --> 01:41:14,860
It's like all these things are beautiful
and they're amazing.

2193
01:41:15,040 --> 01:41:15,873
But then add the add to that,
this experience of this really intense 

2194
01:41:20,321 --> 01:41:23,740
moment with a wild animal where you have
to execute something,

2195
01:41:23,741 --> 01:41:25,750
you have to execute a shot and you have 
to.

2196
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:28,000
Everything has to come together and has 
to come together perfectly.

2197
01:41:28,001 --> 01:41:30,880
And that is what makes this so 
addictive.

2198
01:41:31,510 --> 01:41:32,343
And that's something that man,
I try to relay that to people and I try 

2199
01:41:35,771 --> 01:41:38,650
to explain it but I just feel like my 
words aren't adequate.

2200
01:41:39,100 --> 01:41:41,710
I feel like everything,
everything I always say to describe it,

2201
01:41:41,711 --> 01:41:42,544
I feel like I'm just rambling and it's 
not going to work because you have to 

2202
01:41:45,950 --> 01:41:47,800
kind of have to see it to understand.

2203
01:41:47,960 --> 01:41:49,850
Yeah,
I mean there's very little reference,

2204
01:41:49,851 --> 01:41:51,110
right?
And that's what you're talking about.

2205
01:41:51,140 --> 01:41:51,921
Like you can say,
well,

2206
01:41:51,921 --> 01:41:52,671
it's like,
you know,

2207
01:41:52,671 --> 01:41:53,504
imagine,
you know,

2208
01:41:53,570 --> 01:41:55,470
skiing a perfect,
um,

2209
01:41:55,730 --> 01:41:57,260
you know,
50 degrees,

2210
01:41:57,350 --> 01:41:58,280
powder line,
right?

2211
01:41:58,281 --> 01:41:59,680
Or whatever,
something kind of,

2212
01:41:59,730 --> 01:42:01,130
you know,
heavy with consequence.

2213
01:42:01,131 --> 01:42:05,860
But it's totally different than that.
It's like it's,

2214
01:42:06,230 --> 01:42:08,190
Oh,
I don't know how else to describe it.

2215
01:42:08,250 --> 01:42:09,083
It's,
there's certain words like there's no 

2216
01:42:09,541 --> 01:42:11,630
words for a giant mushroom trip,
you know,

2217
01:42:11,631 --> 01:42:12,464
like I've had,
I've tried to talk to people who've 

2218
01:42:13,261 --> 01:42:14,071
never done anything.
Like,

2219
01:42:14,071 --> 01:42:15,570
what's it like,
you see things,

2220
01:42:15,690 --> 01:42:17,550
you see pretty colors.
Is it really worth it?

2221
01:42:17,860 --> 01:42:19,080
Like you can say,
God,

2222
01:42:19,170 --> 01:42:21,750
you just got to take enough.
Yeah,

2223
01:42:21,751 --> 01:42:22,584
you can definitely see colors.
But I mean I'm just saying those words 

2224
01:42:25,951 --> 01:42:26,670
to beat,
but then,

2225
01:42:26,670 --> 01:42:28,380
you know,
you talked to somebody about it and then

2226
01:42:28,381 --> 01:42:29,730
like a year later they go,
dude,

2227
01:42:29,731 --> 01:42:31,440
I did it.
Whoa.

2228
01:42:31,470 --> 01:42:32,303
Like a buddy of mine recently just did 
DMT and he had talked about it for a 

2229
01:42:35,671 --> 01:42:37,220
long time and they finally did it and 
then he just,

2230
01:42:37,260 --> 01:42:38,610
he sent me a text message.
He's like,

2231
01:42:38,611 --> 01:42:39,570
dude,
I'm at the elves.

2232
01:42:40,270 --> 01:42:41,103
Was like,
oh,

2233
01:42:42,070 --> 01:42:42,960
trip.
No,

2234
01:42:42,961 --> 01:42:43,261
no,
no.

2235
01:42:43,261 --> 01:42:44,094
He texted me after it was over because 
he had been thinking about doing it 

2236
01:42:46,831 --> 01:42:48,780
forever and then it's one of those 
things,

2237
01:42:49,260 --> 01:42:51,000
unless you do it,
whatever I say,

2238
01:42:51,240 --> 01:42:54,090
the way the words that I'm using to 
describe their just not going to work.

2239
01:42:54,330 --> 01:42:56,830
I think that's the case with so many 
experiences in life,

2240
01:42:56,831 --> 01:42:57,664
like try to describe being in love to 
someone who's never been in a 

2241
01:42:59,341 --> 01:43:00,500
relationship.
You know,

2242
01:43:00,840 --> 01:43:01,673
there's no way you could never do it.
You can never explain the love of your 

2243
01:43:03,961 --> 01:43:05,400
children to someone who doesn't have 
kids.

2244
01:43:05,450 --> 01:43:07,440
Who's the dog?
Like,

2245
01:43:09,440 --> 01:43:11,070
Oh man,
figure it out.

2246
01:43:12,520 --> 01:43:13,353
You know,
and I think certain intense experiences 

2247
01:43:15,271 --> 01:43:16,104
in life like hunting or he just even 
mean we even forget the hunting mean 

2248
01:43:19,860 --> 01:43:20,693
just being in the woods,
like attempting to hunt an animal is 

2249
01:43:23,640 --> 01:43:26,160
insane.
Almost psychedelic experience.

2250
01:43:26,410 --> 01:43:28,530
It's one of the things that I described 
people,

2251
01:43:28,770 --> 01:43:29,603
the first trip that we went to,
the Missouri breaks when I shot that 

2252
01:43:32,491 --> 01:43:35,130
deer,
when I locked eyes with that animal,

2253
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:39,090
the fruit for the first time and I was 
sitting on a pack,

2254
01:43:39,480 --> 01:43:40,313
a looking down the scope of this rifle 
and I was looking at this animal and 

2255
01:43:44,101 --> 01:43:47,150
then I look at this animal through this 
rifle scope and he's looking at me.

2256
01:43:47,160 --> 01:43:47,993
I was like,
this is a weird life form that's living 

2257
01:43:51,950 --> 01:43:52,783
in this very barren and desolate place 
where there's no people for miles and 

2258
01:43:58,221 --> 01:44:02,060
I'm locking eyes with this thing and it 
was oddly psychedelic.

2259
01:44:02,061 --> 01:44:02,894
It was oddly like paradigm shifting.
Like the moment was so intense and 

2260
01:44:06,891 --> 01:44:08,120
weird.
I was like,

2261
01:44:08,121 --> 01:44:09,620
wow,
I didn't expect this.

2262
01:44:09,621 --> 01:44:11,120
Like this is.
This is like.

2263
01:44:11,340 --> 01:44:12,173
I mean kind of.
I mean I'm feeling like because this 

2264
01:44:14,931 --> 01:44:15,764
thing is looking at us,
I'm feeling that this thing is thinking 

2265
01:44:17,870 --> 01:44:20,420
like what are you and what are you doing
it?

2266
01:44:20,450 --> 01:44:23,240
We probably never seen a person before.
What are you,

2267
01:44:23,270 --> 01:44:25,220
what are you doing here and should I be 
worried

2268
01:44:25,250 --> 01:44:26,110
about you?
Right.

2269
01:44:26,111 --> 01:44:27,450
He's gone.
That wasn't here yesterday.

2270
01:44:27,451 --> 01:44:28,284
Yeah.
What is that?

2271
01:44:28,320 --> 01:44:29,790
What is that?
And you know,

2272
01:44:29,800 --> 01:44:34,650
he's always seen is like baseball hat 
and then the metal barrel of a rifle and

2273
01:44:34,651 --> 01:44:35,484
he's not seeing much.
He just seeing us resting over the top 

2274
01:44:37,471 --> 01:44:39,000
of a ridge looking down on him and he's 
like,

2275
01:44:39,120 --> 01:44:40,950
fuck that.
It's,

2276
01:44:41,070 --> 01:44:45,270
it's uh,
it's really weird intense experience.

2277
01:44:45,660 --> 01:44:47,040
It is.
And the,

2278
01:44:47,670 --> 01:44:48,540
because

2279
01:44:49,450 --> 01:44:52,300
you do look at things in a much 
different way and,

2280
01:44:52,350 --> 01:44:53,183
and you know,
kind of the point of talking about all 

2281
01:44:56,370 --> 01:44:57,203
this public land stuff is I,
I do feel like people who hunt and fish 

2282
01:45:01,430 --> 01:45:02,263
carry a big load of this burden rent 
through the taxes that we pay that or 

2283
01:45:06,660 --> 01:45:08,570
taxes that if you don't hunt or fish you
don't pay them.

2284
01:45:08,840 --> 01:45:09,673
So we've highlighted that on the show.
The actual amount of it we've showed 

2285
01:45:12,770 --> 01:45:15,770
from the rocky mountain elk foundation,
their instagram page,

2286
01:45:15,771 --> 01:45:16,604
they have a really good instagram page 
that has a bunch of different examples 

2287
01:45:19,281 --> 01:45:20,114
of different states of the sheer volume 
of money that comes in because directly 

2288
01:45:25,100 --> 01:45:28,190
because of hunting and fishing and it's 
staggering.

2289
01:45:28,191 --> 01:45:32,420
It's in the billions and is by far above
and beyond anything else.

2290
01:45:32,480 --> 01:45:33,313
By far,
the the largest amount of conservation 

2291
01:45:36,501 --> 01:45:39,290
money that comes into this country,
the largest by far.

2292
01:45:39,380 --> 01:45:42,980
It is so fishermen,
nothing even close.

2293
01:45:42,981 --> 01:45:45,650
It's amazing when you think about it 
that way in that sense.

2294
01:45:45,651 --> 01:45:46,484
This system that we have here with 
public land and with using these tax 

2295
01:45:49,851 --> 01:45:50,684
dollars to pay for,
for all the wildlife biologists to pay 

2296
01:45:53,481 --> 01:45:56,840
for the fish and game to pay for the 
population management.

2297
01:45:56,841 --> 01:45:58,700
It's amazing.
It's an amazing system,

2298
01:45:58,900 --> 01:46:01,960
but if you're a hiker that your peak 
bagger,

2299
01:46:01,961 --> 01:46:02,794
right?
You're finding names on the map and 

2300
01:46:04,301 --> 01:46:05,850
you're like,
I'm going to hike to this lake or I'm an

2301
01:46:05,860 --> 01:46:07,920
hike to this peak European.
That's.

2302
01:46:07,930 --> 01:46:11,280
We call them a peak bagger bagging piano
bag,

2303
01:46:11,290 --> 01:46:12,790
a peak two peaks.
Have you been to?

2304
01:46:12,870 --> 01:46:13,703
Yeah,
exactly.

2305
01:46:13,780 --> 01:46:14,613
That's interesting.
Peek a big sounds like in that 

2306
01:46:17,260 --> 01:46:18,093
community,
right?

2307
01:46:18,160 --> 01:46:19,020
Boulder?
Yeah.

2308
01:46:19,130 --> 01:46:24,130
Fourteeners and bag and a lot of peaks 
and people fall off those peaks to man.

2309
01:46:24,210 --> 01:46:25,660
Yes.
They get stuck up there.

2310
01:46:26,930 --> 01:46:28,900
Sucks,
but you know,

2311
01:46:29,050 --> 01:46:29,883
you are taking a trail on established 
trail and you're covering miles and 

2312
01:46:33,281 --> 01:46:34,114
you're getting to your goal and maybe 
you're snapping a picture or spending 

2313
01:46:38,441 --> 01:46:39,274
the night and then you're coming back on
that trail or maybe it's a different 

2314
01:46:41,681 --> 01:46:43,810
trail.
Whereas one hunter,

2315
01:46:44,120 --> 01:46:44,953
as you know,
as soon as you step away from the truck 

2316
01:46:48,710 --> 01:46:49,543
and

2317
01:46:50,250 --> 01:46:51,083
or out the trail head,
you are plotting your own course so 

2318
01:46:54,830 --> 01:46:59,830
you're making your own moves and there 
it is a totally different experience.

2319
01:47:00,091 --> 01:47:02,070
Everything means something different to 
you.

2320
01:47:02,071 --> 01:47:02,904
You're looking at it in a different way.
You're trying to interpret different 

2321
01:47:05,461 --> 01:47:09,000
signs and your base note path.
Yeah.

2322
01:47:09,001 --> 01:47:09,740
And your,
your,

2323
01:47:09,740 --> 01:47:13,280
your choices are pretty much limitless.
Absolutely limitless.

2324
01:47:13,380 --> 01:47:14,213
Like when you leave,
as soon as you get off the trail you're 

2325
01:47:17,311 --> 01:47:18,630
just like,
you know,

2326
01:47:18,631 --> 01:47:20,820
hopefully you hear,
you hear something or you see something,

2327
01:47:20,821 --> 01:47:22,920
you smell something and that begins your
day,

2328
01:47:22,921 --> 01:47:24,240
but you don't know.
You might,

2329
01:47:24,300 --> 01:47:27,920
you might not leave a 100 yards that day
and you might cover,

2330
01:47:27,960 --> 01:47:29,280
you know,
might be a heavy,

2331
01:47:29,340 --> 01:47:31,080
you know,
eight mile,

2332
01:47:31,140 --> 01:47:32,520
you know,
5,000

2333
01:47:32,521 --> 01:47:34,260
foot day you don't know.
And that's,

2334
01:47:34,800 --> 01:47:35,633
I don't ask the craziest thing,
you just have to be prepared for 

2335
01:47:37,620 --> 01:47:38,910
whatever.
And so,

2336
01:47:39,060 --> 01:47:40,350
you know,
get people who are like,

2337
01:47:40,351 --> 01:47:41,184
well,
there aren't any wolves here anymore 

2338
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:45,900
because in Idaho wolves were,
you could see them a lot,

2339
01:47:46,320 --> 01:47:50,160
especially in Ketchum area,
the Lohmann area there wolves that,

2340
01:47:50,550 --> 01:47:52,170
you know,
that they're smart critters,

2341
01:47:52,171 --> 01:47:55,200
they know that they knew that nobody was
going to shoot at them.

2342
01:47:55,890 --> 01:47:58,740
And so they were a fairly common 
occurrence to see.

2343
01:47:58,950 --> 01:47:59,783
And then once the season opened,
once they let people go out and they 

2344
01:48:02,851 --> 01:48:04,700
issued tags,
um,

2345
01:48:04,890 --> 01:48:08,220
they picked it up really quick and you 
didn't just see them hanging out next to

2346
01:48:08,221 --> 01:48:09,600
the road and people said,
well,

2347
01:48:09,640 --> 01:48:10,740
none.
Hundreds killed all the walls.

2348
01:48:11,730 --> 01:48:12,563
But oddly enough,
the hunters are reporting Wolf's 

2349
01:48:14,181 --> 01:48:15,740
sightings.
No,

2350
01:48:15,810 --> 01:48:16,643
I saw that.

2351
01:48:16,720 --> 01:48:18,280
Yeah.
They're not killing all the wolves.

2352
01:48:18,281 --> 01:48:19,840
They're killing a pretty small number.
Right?

2353
01:48:21,690 --> 01:48:22,523
Job.
As hunters,

2354
01:48:22,530 --> 01:48:23,640
we're not,
we're not,

2355
01:48:23,670 --> 01:48:24,503
we're not getting,
getting the numbers that were supposed 

2356
01:48:25,531 --> 01:48:25,610
to.

2357
01:48:25,610 --> 01:48:27,470
So what do they do?
Do they,

2358
01:48:27,471 --> 01:48:30,290
are they hiring professional wolf 
killers to,

2359
01:48:30,310 --> 01:48:33,950
to go after a wolves like they're doing 
in California to go after cougars?

2360
01:48:33,980 --> 01:48:37,130
Since they killed,
since they stopped the hunting season on

2361
01:48:37,131 --> 01:48:37,964
mountain lions,
they haven't stopped killing mountain 

2362
01:48:39,111 --> 01:48:39,944
lions.
That's something people don't 

2363
01:48:40,251 --> 01:48:41,084
understand.
Like there was a depredation order on a 

2364
01:48:42,741 --> 01:48:43,574
mountain lion up in the Malibu mountains
that had killed 11 Alpaca and a goat in 

2365
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:52,480
one sitting this big fucker just.
And they know the,

2366
01:48:52,481 --> 01:48:55,460
the lion too because it's tagged,
it has a collar on it.

2367
01:48:55,790 --> 01:48:58,370
And uh,
this fucker just found an Alpaca farm.

2368
01:48:58,371 --> 01:49:01,040
I just went to town,
just had a glory killing spree.

2369
01:49:01,230 --> 01:49:05,390
So in California they can't know no 
mountain lion hunting whatsoever,

2370
01:49:05,420 --> 01:49:09,800
but they're everywhere,
especially in rural areas.

2371
01:49:09,980 --> 01:49:12,240
There's a place called to hone ranch 
where that bolt came from.

2372
01:49:12,390 --> 01:49:13,223
See Front,
there's one lake that they have like a 

2373
01:49:15,651 --> 01:49:17,660
pond they have out there and they have 
trail cam up.

2374
01:49:17,690 --> 01:49:21,200
They've got 17 different mountain lions 
on trail cam.

2375
01:49:21,430 --> 01:49:23,500
Oh my God.
You're about meeting people fairly,

2376
01:49:23,501 --> 01:49:24,580
um,
fairly often out here,

2377
01:49:24,581 --> 01:49:24,880
huh?

2378
01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:25,631
Well,
it can,

2379
01:49:25,631 --> 01:49:26,410
it's,
you know,

2380
01:49:26,410 --> 01:49:27,243
it's a lot of it's joggers or bikers,
like people on trail bikes because they 

2381
01:49:31,481 --> 01:49:33,010
think that trying to get away.
Yeah.

2382
01:49:33,200 --> 01:49:34,033
And other things.
It's almost like a cat with a ball of 

2383
01:49:35,501 --> 01:49:36,790
yarn.
They just can't help themselves.

2384
01:49:36,820 --> 01:49:37,653
Right?
Or flight risk.

2385
01:49:37,840 --> 01:49:39,580
Someone's running the like pitch were 
you gone.

2386
01:49:40,350 --> 01:49:41,183
But the thing is it's like 100 or are 
doing something different than your 

2387
01:49:47,711 --> 01:49:49,650
typical recreate are out there.
You know,

2388
01:49:49,840 --> 01:49:50,673
we're not sticking to a game plan.
So I feel like you're that different 

2389
01:49:54,071 --> 01:49:54,904
hours.
Different making Predator and prey 

2390
01:49:57,161 --> 01:49:57,994
noises,
right?

2391
01:49:58,480 --> 01:49:59,470
Yeah.
Yeah.

2392
01:49:59,471 --> 01:50:00,304
You're just doing things differently.
So I think feel like I get a little 

2393
01:50:03,100 --> 01:50:03,933
torque sometimes where people think,
oh well of course hunters are going to 

2394
01:50:06,131 --> 01:50:08,360
say there's wolves out there.
Know it's,

2395
01:50:08,470 --> 01:50:09,303
it's.
This is good information for biologists 

2396
01:50:11,200 --> 01:50:15,280
because we're out there.
Actually our point in the woods is being

2397
01:50:15,281 --> 01:50:16,360
out there looking for animals.

2398
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:17,633
Now,
one of the reasons why I wanted to have 

2399
01:50:18,211 --> 01:50:19,044
you guys on is to really sort of 
discussed this public land issue and 

2400
01:50:22,140 --> 01:50:27,140
also to allow people to understand 
what's at stake and to give them options

2401
01:50:30,480 --> 01:50:35,480
to look into and to different resources 
that they can check in on.

2402
01:50:35,731 --> 01:50:38,790
Like,
like a back country hunters and anglers.

2403
01:50:38,820 --> 01:50:40,870
A Bha.
Yeah.

2404
01:50:41,040 --> 01:50:43,770
Back Balcony,
back country hunters and anglers.

2405
01:50:43,771 --> 01:50:44,604
I can't say it.
My mouth starts shutting down after two 

2406
01:50:46,591 --> 01:50:50,420
hours these days,
but what they're doing is a amazing like

2407
01:50:50,430 --> 01:50:54,390
highlighting like what this is and how 
important this is and what are the other

2408
01:50:54,391 --> 01:50:56,430
things that people could do if they want
to look into this stuff.

2409
01:50:56,610 --> 01:50:57,840
Yeah.
So Bha is big,

2410
01:50:57,841 --> 01:50:58,674
loud voice and I think they one of the 
best groups out there right now to 

2411
01:51:03,180 --> 01:51:08,180
really just raise awareness.
I'm on public lands and access issues.

2412
01:51:08,970 --> 01:51:11,820
Teddy Roosevelt conservation partnership
does a phenomenal.

2413
01:51:11,821 --> 01:51:12,460
Yeah,

2414
01:51:12,460 --> 01:51:13,293
there it is.
A country hunters and National Wildlife 

2415
01:51:16,390 --> 01:51:16,781
Federation.
By the way.

2416
01:51:16,781 --> 01:51:17,614
You read that there are two folks if you
want to buy that public land owner tee 

2417
01:51:20,831 --> 01:51:21,760
shirt,
they have it there

2418
01:51:22,560 --> 01:51:23,490
now.
Um,

2419
01:51:23,670 --> 01:51:28,500
so what the main issue is in Kenton I,
we talked about,

2420
01:51:28,840 --> 01:51:30,840
you know,
you have an incredible platform here,

2421
01:51:30,841 --> 01:51:32,430
Joanne,
and we don't want to waste it.

2422
01:51:32,820 --> 01:51:36,360
So the,
this is a nonpartisan issue.

2423
01:51:37,170 --> 01:51:40,380
If you don't like 100 and $800 or 
anglers,

2424
01:51:41,370 --> 01:51:45,330
that is still your land.
If you never leave downtown La,

2425
01:51:45,960 --> 01:51:50,460
all this public land contributes to your
quality of life through clean air,

2426
01:51:50,461 --> 01:51:51,294
clean water,
just knowing that it's there should be 

2427
01:51:54,180 --> 01:51:55,013
it something that is warm and cozy for 
you because it is your birthright as an 

2428
01:52:00,571 --> 01:52:01,404
American

2429
01:52:01,600 --> 01:52:05,130
in this country where 95 percent of the 
people you meet,

2430
01:52:05,170 --> 01:52:07,380
something,
it might even be higher than that.

2431
01:52:07,920 --> 01:52:11,550
It's depending upon it and there's so 
many,

2432
01:52:11,910 --> 01:52:14,910
so many discussions these days about 
where your food comes from.

2433
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:19,230
There's no better way to find out where 
your food comes from then to actually go

2434
01:52:19,231 --> 01:52:20,064
out and get it.

2435
01:52:20,120 --> 01:52:20,990
Yeah,
absolutely.

2436
01:52:21,590 --> 01:52:22,670
Absolutely.
But man,

2437
01:52:22,671 --> 01:52:27,500
if if you're buying beef or lamb off off
the grocery store shelf,

2438
01:52:28,130 --> 01:52:29,960
those grazing permits that we talked 
about,

2439
01:52:30,170 --> 01:52:31,003
that happened,
a lot of that happens on federally 

2440
01:52:32,781 --> 01:52:33,614
managed lands,
whether it's Blm or forest service 

2441
01:52:37,191 --> 01:52:38,024
ground.
And the thing is this is nonpartisan 

2442
01:52:41,060 --> 01:52:43,280
again,
and one of the things that ticked me off

2443
01:52:43,310 --> 01:52:46,130
about old Jason Chavez,
hr six,

2444
01:52:46,130 --> 01:52:47,210
21 and said,
hey,

2445
01:52:47,540 --> 01:52:50,060
you know,
this started under Obama,

2446
01:52:50,840 --> 01:52:55,550
Clinton or Clinton Clinton took 
designated these lands is useless.

2447
01:52:55,580 --> 01:52:57,050
Yeah,
who cares?

2448
01:52:57,440 --> 01:52:59,030
I don't care.
It was Clinton,

2449
01:52:59,031 --> 01:52:59,930
Obama,
trump,

2450
01:52:59,960 --> 01:53:01,340
that doesn't matter.
Who Cares?

2451
01:53:01,350 --> 01:53:02,850
You're taking the Lexan.
Who Cares?

2452
01:53:02,930 --> 01:53:05,950
Yeah,
point to back.

2453
01:53:05,990 --> 01:53:06,823
It's a nonpartisan issue and I think a 
lot of times people would like you to 

2454
01:53:10,131 --> 01:53:10,851
believe,
Oh,

2455
01:53:10,851 --> 01:53:14,480
if you're a republican year against this
or if you're know pro,

2456
01:53:14,481 --> 01:53:17,180
second amendment,
you can't vote for that and this,

2457
01:53:17,240 --> 01:53:18,073
that and the fact is is that you can,
if you have a Republican leader in your 

2458
01:53:22,881 --> 01:53:25,190
area,
they can change their mind.

2459
01:53:25,191 --> 01:53:26,750
You need to be involved.
Right?

2460
01:53:26,751 --> 01:53:28,670
And if,
and if that's the way you feel,

2461
01:53:28,671 --> 01:53:29,504
that's great,
but you have to realize that you can't 

2462
01:53:31,661 --> 01:53:34,220
have your cake and eat it too.
It doesn't have to be one or the other.

2463
01:53:34,250 --> 01:53:35,600
Like,
you know what I mean,

2464
01:53:35,601 --> 01:53:36,434
you,
you can be a conservative and still be 

2465
01:53:38,511 --> 01:53:39,910
pro public lands,
you know,

2466
01:53:39,920 --> 01:53:40,753
and you need to work and call and do 
what you need to change them if they're 

2467
01:53:43,791 --> 01:53:44,680
not.
Because if,

2468
01:53:44,720 --> 01:53:46,880
once it's gone,
it's gone and use social

2469
01:53:46,960 --> 01:53:51,070
media because social media is an amazing
tool and that's what killed her six,

2470
01:53:51,080 --> 01:53:51,913
21.
It was directly killed by social media 

2471
01:53:53,151 --> 01:53:56,140
and he was killed quick who was killed a
couple of weeks,

2472
01:53:56,560 --> 01:53:57,393
you know the pressure that they faced 
from guys like me posting it to one 

2473
01:54:00,161 --> 01:54:00,994
point 8 million people on Instagram,
one and a half million people on 

2474
01:54:03,251 --> 01:54:06,940
facebook say $3 million or whatever the 
fuck it is on twitter.

2475
01:54:06,941 --> 01:54:10,390
Like all those people that add up and 
then those people find out about it.

2476
01:54:10,391 --> 01:54:13,210
They jump in and they realize that this 
is a.

2477
01:54:13,270 --> 01:54:14,103
This is a really important issue.
It's a giant issue and Rinella always 

2478
01:54:18,401 --> 01:54:20,290
points out that he's.
By the way,

2479
01:54:20,291 --> 01:54:24,730
Rinella wrote a great article about all 
this and about how killing her six,

2480
01:54:24,731 --> 01:54:29,080
21 is just one battle in the overall war
and we're not.

2481
01:54:29,081 --> 01:54:29,914
There's no not out of the woods by any 
stretch of the imagination and that 

2482
01:54:32,291 --> 01:54:36,100
article is available right now.
If you go to his twitter,

2483
01:54:36,101 --> 01:54:39,700
it's on.
I think it's on a meat eater.com.

2484
01:54:40,210 --> 01:54:41,200
Is that where it is?
Yeah.

2485
01:54:41,470 --> 01:54:42,310
Yeah,
but no,

2486
01:54:42,311 --> 01:54:43,660
that's not.
That's one,

2487
01:54:43,690 --> 01:54:47,950
but there's one that I tweeted today.
This is the one from January.

2488
01:54:47,951 --> 01:54:52,900
Twentieth is one that I tweeted today 
that he just recently wrote and he calls

2489
01:54:52,901 --> 01:54:54,880
himself a political unit because he's 
like,

2490
01:54:54,910 --> 01:54:55,750
look,
he goes,

2491
01:54:55,930 --> 01:54:59,650
the Republicans want to sell off the 
land and the Democrats want to take away

2492
01:54:59,651 --> 01:55:00,650
your guns.
He's like,

2493
01:55:00,670 --> 01:55:02,450
I don't know where the fuck to go.
You know?

2494
01:55:02,590 --> 01:55:03,550
In that sense,

2495
01:55:03,680 --> 01:55:04,400
well,
I'm not.

2496
01:55:04,400 --> 01:55:07,910
My point simply is that you can change.
You know what I mean?

2497
01:55:07,911 --> 01:55:10,010
It's like if you,
you need,

2498
01:55:10,120 --> 01:55:10,953
it's not a part.
It shouldn't be a part of your 

2499
01:55:12,050 --> 01:55:16,610
representatives are there to represent 
your interests and this is the article.

2500
01:55:16,611 --> 01:55:17,480
It's Roosevelt

2501
01:55:17,510 --> 01:55:18,343
robber barons and the continued fight 
for our public lands and he just 

2502
01:55:21,771 --> 01:55:24,980
published it today.
And is that on [inaudible] Dot com?

2503
01:55:25,040 --> 01:55:25,873
Yes.
Yes.

2504
01:55:26,140 --> 01:55:29,050
The meat eater.com.
Somebody owns [inaudible] dot com.

2505
01:55:29,051 --> 01:55:29,884
Yeah.
Isn't that weird?

2506
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:30,753
Give it up,
bitch.

2507
01:55:32,110 --> 01:55:34,760
I'm going to give it up.
What does media to go to?

2508
01:55:34,770 --> 01:55:36,070
Meat Dot Com.
What is that?

2509
01:55:36,220 --> 01:55:37,053
I think it is it available.
Is one of those things has been just 

2510
01:55:39,251 --> 01:55:42,520
like a picture of a steak for years.
There you go.

2511
01:55:42,580 --> 01:55:43,710
Garlic top sirloin.

2512
01:55:44,010 --> 01:55:45,750
It's delicious.
Best Cowen school.

2513
01:55:45,870 --> 01:55:46,703
So is this like someone just holding it?
I think the person may have died or 

2514
01:55:50,071 --> 01:55:52,040
something and they're dead.
Uh,

2515
01:55:52,220 --> 01:55:55,120
but.
So yeah,

2516
01:55:55,280 --> 01:55:57,060
they have a fork with a piece of meat.
Look,

2517
01:55:57,090 --> 01:55:59,460
here is my food,
chicken drumstick.

2518
01:55:59,880 --> 01:56:01,860
Look at my food.
Hr Six,

2519
01:56:01,900 --> 01:56:06,030
22,
going to gut the folks that are supposed

2520
01:56:06,031 --> 01:56:08,220
to be out there protecting our 
resources,

2521
01:56:08,590 --> 01:56:11,550
making sure people play Nice on,
on public lands.

2522
01:56:11,680 --> 01:56:12,900
Yeah.
Um,

2523
01:56:13,380 --> 01:56:14,380
you know,
the uh,

2524
01:56:14,460 --> 01:56:15,690
planning two point,
oh,

2525
01:56:15,720 --> 01:56:19,020
just a terrible name.
Not Sexy at all,

2526
01:56:19,021 --> 01:56:19,854
but that is the new management plan for 
a bureau land management that just got 

2527
01:56:25,830 --> 01:56:27,900
shut down.
It's going up to the Senate right now.

2528
01:56:27,901 --> 01:56:31,860
So the thing is,
if you want to know what you can do,

2529
01:56:32,490 --> 01:56:36,750
you have got signed these petitions that
are going around Trc p,

2530
01:56:36,751 --> 01:56:38,640
he's got a great one.
The sportsman's pledge.

2531
01:56:38,890 --> 01:56:40,490
Um,
you know,

2532
01:56:40,500 --> 01:56:42,430
join our rod and gun club.
Bah,

2533
01:56:42,450 --> 01:56:46,020
a national wildlife federation.
These lands are here for everybody.

2534
01:56:46,021 --> 01:56:48,440
It's not just hunters and fishermen.
Um,

2535
01:56:49,050 --> 01:56:49,883
and Oh,
you got to do is write emails and call 

2536
01:56:54,210 --> 01:56:58,350
your duly represent your officials that 
are there to represent you.

2537
01:56:58,480 --> 01:56:59,313
And by the way,
back country hunters and anglers has a 

2538
01:57:01,241 --> 01:57:03,850
form that you could fill out on their 
site.

2539
01:57:03,851 --> 01:57:06,520
They'll send it for you,
you enter entering your email,

2540
01:57:06,530 --> 01:57:08,830
they have like a,
a letter that's already written up,

2541
01:57:09,220 --> 01:57:10,053
so it's super easy to do and they'll,
they'll direct you to where it needs to 

2542
01:57:13,451 --> 01:57:14,710
be sent.
And you know,

2543
01:57:14,711 --> 01:57:18,560
they're doing a great job of setting 
that up and letting people know.

2544
01:57:18,561 --> 01:57:20,020
I mean,
we got to be,

2545
01:57:20,040 --> 01:57:21,730
got to be wise about this.
This is,

2546
01:57:21,760 --> 01:57:23,280
we have an amazing place.
It's an,

2547
01:57:23,350 --> 01:57:26,140
it's an amazing thing that the fact that
you guys live,

2548
01:57:26,560 --> 01:57:27,780
like you were saying that,
uh,

2549
01:57:27,790 --> 01:57:29,410
what does it church Frank Church,
what does it,

2550
01:57:29,411 --> 01:57:31,570
Frank Church,
Frank Church wilderness.

2551
01:57:31,720 --> 01:57:32,553
I mean,
imagine if you went up there and it's 

2552
01:57:33,190 --> 01:57:34,023
fucking mall.

2553
01:57:34,650 --> 01:57:35,483
Oh No.
Somebody chopped all the trees down and 

2554
01:57:37,570 --> 01:57:38,403
we'll put up a gold cart.
So if you look at the state planned 

2555
01:57:42,691 --> 01:57:43,524
example,
read the state lands are there to make 

2556
01:57:44,881 --> 01:57:46,920
money for the states.
And like we said,

2557
01:57:47,400 --> 01:57:49,290
state gets in trouble.
They sell those lands,

2558
01:57:49,680 --> 01:57:51,270
fire anything,
right?

2559
01:57:51,300 --> 01:57:52,133
They just,
it just sucks all the money out of the 

2560
01:57:53,341 --> 01:57:54,174
state and then the states literally 
mandated not to have a negative balance 

2561
01:57:57,571 --> 01:57:59,670
so that once that happens,
it's like,

2562
01:57:59,671 --> 01:58:02,460
how are we going to make our money?
How is Roosevelt so wise?

2563
01:58:03,630 --> 01:58:04,463
He had just panic,
fear of God put into him because he had 

2564
01:58:07,831 --> 01:58:10,050
this realization that he's like,
oh my God,

2565
01:58:10,500 --> 01:58:15,500
the entire reason I am who I am today is
because I had this opportunity to go out

2566
01:58:15,571 --> 01:58:19,110
and chase animals and and if I saw 
horizon line,

2567
01:58:19,140 --> 01:58:21,390
I could go over the top of it because 
nobody owned it.

2568
01:58:22,590 --> 01:58:24,510
He was like,
that made me who I am.

2569
01:58:25,170 --> 01:58:27,720
I got to try to make sure that this is 
here for the next person.

2570
01:58:28,620 --> 01:58:32,880
People don't understand that in many 
countries that's not really possible and

2571
01:58:32,881 --> 01:58:33,714
that's actually the story of Robin Hood.
Story of Robin Hood wasn't really about 

2572
01:58:38,251 --> 01:58:41,680
stealing from the rich and stealing 
their money and giving it to the poor.

2573
01:58:41,890 --> 01:58:44,710
It was about hunting lands.
That was the original.

2574
01:58:45,910 --> 01:58:46,743
The king did not let anyone hunt in the 
kingdoms hunting lands and Robin Hood 

2575
01:58:51,370 --> 01:58:52,450
was like,
fuck you.

2576
01:58:52,750 --> 01:58:53,583
And he went out the air and he was 
shooting deer and getting people food 

2577
01:58:55,811 --> 01:58:57,880
because people were starving.
And that,

2578
01:58:58,090 --> 01:59:01,240
that is something that we can do here in
America that you can't.

2579
01:59:01,270 --> 01:59:02,103
It's like,
it's one of the reasons why you get so 

2580
01:59:02,921 --> 01:59:03,754
much hate mail from Europe.
You've got a lot of hate mail from 

2581
01:59:05,621 --> 01:59:08,290
places where they don't have 
recreational hunting because to them,

2582
01:59:08,291 --> 01:59:10,690
and they don't even understand it and 
they're eating steak,

2583
01:59:10,960 --> 01:59:11,793
they're eating steak.
Like my wife got into an argument with 

2584
01:59:13,841 --> 01:59:16,300
one of her friend's husbands were,
um,

2585
01:59:16,390 --> 01:59:17,890
you know,
she was saying that,

2586
01:59:17,891 --> 01:59:20,140
uh,
I was on a hunting trip and this guy was

2587
01:59:20,200 --> 01:59:22,990
eating a steak,
carving a steak,

2588
01:59:23,290 --> 01:59:24,340
literally are at dinner.

2589
01:59:24,580 --> 01:59:25,031
And he's like,
well,

2590
01:59:25,031 --> 01:59:26,980
that's deplorable.
That's deplorable.

2591
01:59:26,981 --> 01:59:28,120
He hunts animals,
like,

2592
01:59:28,121 --> 01:59:29,350
you don't have to do that.
Like,

2593
01:59:29,351 --> 01:59:30,250
she.
And she's like,

2594
01:59:30,251 --> 01:59:32,050
you're eating a steak.
She's like,

2595
01:59:32,051 --> 01:59:33,640
well,
these animals are farmed animals.

2596
01:59:33,641 --> 01:59:34,210
And they're.
I go,

2597
01:59:34,210 --> 01:59:34,871
she goes,
well,

2598
01:59:34,871 --> 01:59:37,630
don't you think that that animal lived 
to horrific existence?

2599
01:59:37,780 --> 01:59:38,613
And then finally was killed.
You think that's better than someone 

2600
01:59:40,931 --> 01:59:41,764
just out of nowhere.
You're hiding behind a bush making cow 

2601
01:59:44,111 --> 01:59:44,944
calls.
And you blast and Arrow through the 

2602
01:59:45,731 --> 01:59:49,240
heart of some wild beast and then take 
that thing down off the mountain.

2603
01:59:49,241 --> 01:59:51,310
You have the experience,
you have the food.

2604
01:59:51,311 --> 01:59:54,550
You also have this wild encounter with 
this,

2605
01:59:54,551 --> 01:59:55,384
this magnificent beasts that you have 
this connection to that every time you 

2606
01:59:58,961 --> 01:59:59,794
eat,
like every time I eat a steak off of 

2607
02:00:02,051 --> 02:00:02,884
that elk,
I think about the experience of hunting 

2608
02:00:04,661 --> 02:00:06,280
that thing.
I think about seeing it.

2609
02:00:06,490 --> 02:00:09,310
I think about cutting it up and carrying
it out of there.

2610
02:00:09,311 --> 02:00:12,900
I did the whole thing about it is all 
it's all connected.

2611
02:00:12,910 --> 02:00:15,640
That loading it into the truck,
hoisting it up.

2612
02:00:15,641 --> 02:00:16,474
Like the whole thing is like in my mind,
every time I cut into the meat and 

2613
02:00:19,991 --> 02:00:24,310
people at the end of the day are 
genetically hardwired to do that.

2614
02:00:25,120 --> 02:00:25,960
Yeah.
It's weird.

2615
02:00:26,110 --> 02:00:26,943
You know,
it's weird when you tap into that file 

2616
02:00:28,690 --> 02:00:29,523
and go,
you didn't know about this file working 

2617
02:00:31,091 --> 02:00:31,980
for it,
man.

2618
02:00:32,170 --> 02:00:35,500
Work Experience on public lands.
There is.

2619
02:00:36,160 --> 02:00:36,993
It's just.
We talk about this at length all the 

2620
02:00:39,401 --> 02:00:40,234
time and Kenton's got this knicker 
analogy and we're walking around shot 

2621
02:00:43,091 --> 02:00:43,924
show and there's this European hunting 
company down the road and he stopped me 

2622
02:00:47,430 --> 02:00:48,630
and he's like,
Hey Kel.

2623
02:00:49,330 --> 02:00:50,163
It's like we lose all this land.
This is what we're going to be making 

2624
02:00:53,100 --> 02:00:56,370
knickers fake hunting.

2625
02:00:56,510 --> 02:00:57,343
I'm not gonna say there's fake hunting,
but it's like a canned experience 

2626
02:01:01,680 --> 02:01:02,513
hunting here and ones where they 
released the pheasants out of the back 

2627
02:01:06,941 --> 02:01:10,930
of a truck and that does happen folks.
There's a thing called pheasant shoots,

2628
02:01:11,140 --> 02:01:11,973
European pheasant shoots and they 
literally release these birds and the 

2629
02:01:15,401 --> 02:01:16,234
birds fly away and guys stand there with
guns waiting for them to release from 

2630
02:01:19,400 --> 02:01:22,180
the cage and shoot them.
That's how Dick Cheney shot his friend.

2631
02:01:22,930 --> 02:01:25,600
Remember that?
Remember that story?

2632
02:01:25,720 --> 02:01:26,553
He shot his friend in the fucking face 
and that was a canned hunt where they 

2633
02:01:30,521 --> 02:01:32,590
just opened.
They literally open a can.

2634
02:01:32,591 --> 02:01:35,560
The birds fly out and they wait and boom
and shoot them.

2635
02:01:36,610 --> 02:01:40,130
I mean the hunting thing.
It's honestly like being outside

2636
02:01:40,130 --> 02:01:41,990
of your,
your comfort zone.

2637
02:01:41,991 --> 02:01:43,790
That is it.
Fabien and,

2638
02:01:43,791 --> 02:01:44,571
and I mean,
you know,

2639
02:01:44,571 --> 02:01:46,850
and if,
if that's not going to happen,

2640
02:01:46,851 --> 02:01:47,750
I don't know,
I'm not interest

2641
02:01:47,780 --> 02:01:48,810
did,
I don't know man,

2642
02:01:48,830 --> 02:01:51,210
but public hunting experiences,
man,

2643
02:01:51,211 --> 02:01:52,350
we're all,
you know,

2644
02:01:53,330 --> 02:01:54,163
that's where you follow the rules read 
because everybody gets the same 

2645
02:01:56,931 --> 02:01:57,764
experience on and on our side.
We are constantly like analyzing our 

2646
02:02:02,781 --> 02:02:03,614
clothing and analyzing our days and 
we're getting to be totally truthful 

2647
02:02:09,400 --> 02:02:11,020
ma'am.
Life at firstline.

2648
02:02:11,090 --> 02:02:11,923
Pretty fricking good man.
We get to spend a lot of days in the 

2649
02:02:13,911 --> 02:02:14,744
woods way more than your average joe 
gets to and that's how we make stuff 

2650
02:02:20,091 --> 02:02:21,770
good and

2651
02:02:22,380 --> 02:02:23,213
well with the way you guys do it is you 
have new pieces and then you give them 

2652
02:02:26,971 --> 02:02:30,460
to like your representatives,
like people that you guys have like w,

2653
02:02:30,461 --> 02:02:31,294
what do you guys call them?
Ambassadors or something like that when 

2654
02:02:33,901 --> 02:02:34,680
you call them,
you know,

2655
02:02:34,680 --> 02:02:36,030
team guys,
team guys.

2656
02:02:36,340 --> 02:02:39,300
So you have a bunch of guys who I follow
on Instagram,

2657
02:02:39,360 --> 02:02:43,230
hardcore hunters who spend a giant chunk
of their life out in the woods.

2658
02:02:43,440 --> 02:02:45,690
Some are public,
some are not,

2659
02:02:46,480 --> 02:02:47,313
but the idea is to set,
to send them to people that use them in 

2660
02:02:49,330 --> 02:02:51,340
tons of different environments like,
you know,

2661
02:02:51,341 --> 02:02:56,170
we hunted in a rocky so we know we've 
got plenty of experience there,

2662
02:02:56,171 --> 02:02:56,910
but it's cool.
We'll,

2663
02:02:56,910 --> 02:02:58,980
we'll send stay stuff to,
you know,

2664
02:02:58,990 --> 02:03:03,580
guys hunting in BC or guys hunting in ak
where it's raining all the time,

2665
02:03:03,581 --> 02:03:05,170
but that's the,
that's the goal,

2666
02:03:05,350 --> 02:03:06,280
you know,
or where it's hot,

2667
02:03:06,520 --> 02:03:07,353
but being able to send stuff out and 
have it used in these tons of different 

2668
02:03:10,481 --> 02:03:12,910
environments allows us just to build 
better stuff,

2669
02:03:12,940 --> 02:03:14,020
you know?
Yeah.

2670
02:03:14,021 --> 02:03:14,440
And it's

2671
02:03:14,440 --> 02:03:15,273
real trial and error thing.
Were you taking these super experienced 

2672
02:03:18,761 --> 02:03:20,950
guys and when you said some guys are 
public,

2673
02:03:20,951 --> 02:03:21,784
some guys are not.
What you mean is some guys have public 

2674
02:03:23,321 --> 02:03:24,154
profiles in some guys,
they just stay under the radar and just 

2675
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:29,590
third guys like that,
right?

2676
02:03:29,620 --> 02:03:30,520
Yeah,
yeah.

2677
02:03:30,640 --> 02:03:33,050
Yeah.
And I mean that's it.

2678
02:03:34,030 --> 02:03:35,830
Everything gets thoroughly tested in the
end.

2679
02:03:35,831 --> 02:03:36,664
That's the fun part.
But the amazing thing about us and one 

2680
02:03:39,011 --> 02:03:39,844
of the things that I love is we get 
interns and people from all across the 

2681
02:03:43,001 --> 02:03:43,834
country that have sometimes very little 
experience and sometimes their input is 

2682
02:03:47,561 --> 02:03:50,230
the most valuable for sure.
You get a bunch of people who are like,

2683
02:03:50,680 --> 02:03:52,170
I know it all right.
I,

2684
02:03:52,210 --> 02:03:53,530
oh no,
don't worry about that.

2685
02:03:53,531 --> 02:03:57,970
Nobody does that.
And then you get this girl from Ohio.

2686
02:03:57,971 --> 02:04:00,970
And she's like,
well what about this?

2687
02:04:00,971 --> 02:04:02,260
And this happened to me.
And you're like,

2688
02:04:04,210 --> 02:04:05,380
really?
Yeah,

2689
02:04:05,500 --> 02:04:06,333
no,
because it's a fresh brand new 

2690
02:04:07,571 --> 02:04:09,550
perspective of somebody who just started
hunting.

2691
02:04:09,760 --> 02:04:13,000
And I think that that's been an 
incredibly valuable on our line too.

2692
02:04:13,030 --> 02:04:13,580
So

2693
02:04:13,580 --> 02:04:15,800
living there too is it's living in the 
mountains,

2694
02:04:15,850 --> 02:04:18,470
you know,
you get to take stuff from all different

2695
02:04:18,650 --> 02:04:19,970
sports,
whether you're,

2696
02:04:20,200 --> 02:04:21,033
you know,
riding your bike or whether you're back 

2697
02:04:22,671 --> 02:04:25,550
country skiing,
like a lot of that stuff crosses over,

2698
02:04:25,551 --> 02:04:26,384
you know.
And I think that allows us to round 

2699
02:04:28,131 --> 02:04:29,360
things out nicely.
Like,

2700
02:04:29,720 --> 02:04:31,040
you know,
hiking,

2701
02:04:31,220 --> 02:04:33,230
hunting is quite different than hiking,
right?

2702
02:04:33,530 --> 02:04:34,363
Like hiking,
people want to build the lightest thing 

2703
02:04:35,661 --> 02:04:38,760
they can build that can do whatever.
Hunting totally different.

2704
02:04:38,761 --> 02:04:40,470
You're off the trail,
you're going through bushes,

2705
02:04:40,471 --> 02:04:43,320
like you kind of have to throw that 
lightest thing out the window,

2706
02:04:43,321 --> 02:04:44,154
you know,
you have to approach it of like how 

2707
02:04:45,961 --> 02:04:49,560
heavy can I actually build this and have
it still work well because it's going to

2708
02:04:49,561 --> 02:04:51,000
get thrashed,
you know what I mean?

2709
02:04:51,001 --> 02:04:54,870
So you've got to approach it from kind 
of a different shift and how,

2710
02:04:55,290 --> 02:04:58,020
you know when you build stuff it needs 
to be versatile,

2711
02:04:58,021 --> 02:04:58,320
right?

2712
02:04:58,320 --> 02:05:00,900
Like you can't have,
you know,

2713
02:05:01,020 --> 02:05:01,860
I don't know.
It did.

2714
02:05:01,861 --> 02:05:02,694
The equivalent would be like having a 
guy that was a construction worker and 

2715
02:05:04,741 --> 02:05:07,980
he's got an eight penny nail.
He's got a 16 penny nails.

2716
02:05:07,981 --> 02:05:10,260
He have ate penny hammer and a 16 penny 
hammer.

2717
02:05:10,261 --> 02:05:11,340
It's like,
no,

2718
02:05:11,341 --> 02:05:13,980
you need to be able to do everything 
with,

2719
02:05:14,400 --> 02:05:17,070
you know,
a certain amount of stuff because you're

2720
02:05:17,071 --> 02:05:19,500
going out in the woods and you know,
you might be walking slow,

2721
02:05:19,501 --> 02:05:21,780
you might be stopping,
you might be going uphill,

2722
02:05:21,960 --> 02:05:23,460
you might be going down hill,
you know,

2723
02:05:23,461 --> 02:05:26,760
and it just allows carrying fewer things
that do more job.

2724
02:05:26,870 --> 02:05:27,703
And then you might have to go through 
thick brush and you might have to have 

2725
02:05:30,201 --> 02:05:31,034
clothes that are durable or if you're in
Texas you might have stuff that has 

2726
02:05:33,741 --> 02:05:34,574
thorns and shit.
It's going to be ripping your clothes 

2727
02:05:36,621 --> 02:05:38,920
and don't go to Texas.
Don't go to that effort.

2728
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:39,833
Everything stabs you in Texas is that.
Texas is a great example of what could 

2729
02:05:46,011 --> 02:05:50,270
possibly happen if we lost public lands 
because Texas is weird.

2730
02:05:50,960 --> 02:05:52,490
I love Texas.
Don't get me wrong.

2731
02:05:52,491 --> 02:05:54,050
I love the state.
I love the people.

2732
02:05:54,051 --> 02:05:59,000
It's one of my favorite places on earth,
but Texas hunting is very strange.

2733
02:05:59,210 --> 02:06:03,440
There's a lot of it that's high fence 
and a lot of it is like over feeders.

2734
02:06:03,441 --> 02:06:04,274
They have like these feed machines and 
these animals come to the feed machines 

2735
02:06:06,861 --> 02:06:10,070
and they're overrun with wild pigs and 
then an amputee is fucking weird.

2736
02:06:10,160 --> 02:06:12,710
African animals that you can hunt 
anytime you want.

2737
02:06:13,070 --> 02:06:14,140
I mean,
there's.

2738
02:06:14,540 --> 02:06:16,640
It was a bit for my last special,
but it's true.

2739
02:06:16,641 --> 02:06:17,474
There's more tigers in captivity in 
Texas than there are in all of the wild 

2740
02:06:21,681 --> 02:06:22,940
of the world.
Really?

2741
02:06:23,060 --> 02:06:23,900
Yeah.
Really?

2742
02:06:23,920 --> 02:06:25,280
Oh,
I'm telling me that's not true.

2743
02:06:25,510 --> 02:06:27,860
Totally true.
There's more tigers and dudes.

2744
02:06:27,861 --> 02:06:30,440
Fucking backyard.
It's private collections.

2745
02:06:30,441 --> 02:06:32,390
Not Zeus.
Not Wildlife.

2746
02:06:32,391 --> 02:06:33,224
Sanctuaries.
More Tigers in private collections in 

2747
02:06:35,751 --> 02:06:39,050
taxis will 100 percent legal.
There's no laws in Texas.

2748
02:06:39,290 --> 02:06:40,990
You just can't have wheat.
No wheat for your.

2749
02:06:41,530 --> 02:06:43,160
That's it.
No gay marriage.

2750
02:06:43,161 --> 02:06:45,320
No Lien.
I want to hunt in Texas,

2751
02:06:45,420 --> 02:06:47,100
but clean,
but yet,

2752
02:06:47,210 --> 02:06:49,130
but I would like to 100 there.
It's awesome.

2753
02:06:49,131 --> 02:06:53,510
I love Texas,
but you like they have like symitar oryx

2754
02:06:53,511 --> 02:06:57,450
and fucking Elan's and all these weird 
African animals that are running around.

2755
02:06:57,480 --> 02:06:58,313
Look at that.
There are more captive tigers in Texas 

2756
02:06:59,721 --> 02:07:00,620
than in the wild.

2757
02:07:01,640 --> 02:07:03,380
As real.
As real as fuck,

2758
02:07:03,740 --> 02:07:06,290
but yeah man,
you don't need the type of innovation.

2759
02:07:06,300 --> 02:07:07,133
20,000
privately owned big cats including 

2760
02:07:09,920 --> 02:07:10,753
tigers,
lions and cougars currently living in 

2761
02:07:12,771 --> 02:07:13,604
captivity in the US,
but the exact number is unknown due to 

2762
02:07:16,220 --> 02:07:17,053
insufficient recordkeeping.
None of your fucking business quarter 

2763
02:07:20,620 --> 02:07:24,730
doesn't count like those little kind of 
those little whatever.

2764
02:07:24,740 --> 02:07:26,570
No Man.
I've been to Texas and I've,

2765
02:07:26,571 --> 02:07:27,404
I've,
I have a friend in Texas that has a 

2766
02:07:28,821 --> 02:07:31,910
buddy of his that has a fucking tiger 
thing and his yard,

2767
02:07:32,390 --> 02:07:36,790
he's got this giant fenced out.
Area's got a giant and in his ranch he's

2768
02:07:36,791 --> 02:07:40,480
got a bunch of fucking tigers and it'll 
just feed them like a cow.

2769
02:07:40,730 --> 02:07:42,080
They'll live cow.
No,

2770
02:07:42,400 --> 02:07:45,070
well they could if you want to.
Maybe we won't admit it to me,

2771
02:07:45,340 --> 02:07:48,040
but they'd take a cow or calf,
shoot it in the head,

2772
02:07:48,070 --> 02:07:49,030
toss it over the fence.

2773
02:07:49,040 --> 02:07:51,030
These things tear it apart.
Unreal.

2774
02:07:51,070 --> 02:07:52,660
And they watch it.
Ha.

2775
02:07:52,980 --> 02:07:54,850
They fucking drink.
A couple of Budweiser says,

2776
02:07:54,940 --> 02:07:58,120
fuck their cousin and he ha.
Look at that.

2777
02:07:58,870 --> 02:08:02,080
Chief of Dallas and his wife are the 
proud owners of three,

2778
02:08:02,130 --> 02:08:04,990
600 pound tigers.
They have raised since they were born,

2779
02:08:05,020 --> 02:08:08,080
Jesus Christ,
police chief in Dallas,

2780
02:08:08,290 --> 02:08:10,900
former police chief,
Jesus Christ.

2781
02:08:11,650 --> 02:08:12,483
Like many Texans,
Bill Rathburn is no longer satisfied 

2782
02:08:14,921 --> 02:08:18,040
with an ordinary pit will.
I had a German shepherd,

2783
02:08:18,041 --> 02:08:21,760
but that queer,
all you want to do is Hump my leg.

2784
02:08:22,810 --> 02:08:25,270
Tired of this Nigga,
Goddamn American animal.

2785
02:08:25,300 --> 02:08:29,680
These cats tend to mind me even though I
use no discipline.

2786
02:08:29,860 --> 02:08:31,330
He says,
no discipline at all.

2787
02:08:31,780 --> 02:08:33,730
Shut your fucking mouth before you get 
killed.

2788
02:08:33,760 --> 02:08:34,593
He has 22 tigers.
This guy said he's even trained these 

2789
02:08:36,521 --> 02:08:39,280
tigers to remain team.
Oh my God.

2790
02:08:39,281 --> 02:08:42,700
You unfortunately you can buy at tiger 
for less than a thousand dollars.

2791
02:08:42,830 --> 02:08:46,260
Now it makes me think tigers do new.

2792
02:08:46,380 --> 02:08:50,050
See,
Texas has completely different laws when

2793
02:08:50,051 --> 02:08:54,220
it comes to wildlife.
Wildlife in Texas is not.

2794
02:08:54,490 --> 02:08:58,210
It's it's private property.
It's a whole different situation.

2795
02:08:58,480 --> 02:08:59,313
I mean they have tags and it comes to 
like white tail deer and indigenous 

2796
02:09:01,571 --> 02:09:03,440
species,
but when it comes in,

2797
02:09:03,560 --> 02:09:05,380
who knows if even the white tails are 
indigenous,

2798
02:09:05,381 --> 02:09:06,214
they're.
I mean they're bringing them in from 

2799
02:09:07,271 --> 02:09:10,390
farms so they have bigger racks now.
They have a lot of weird shit.

2800
02:09:10,391 --> 02:09:13,450
They do,
it must be if you have a high fence,

2801
02:09:14,050 --> 02:09:17,770
then it's once you add things like fully
fenced,

2802
02:09:18,010 --> 02:09:20,320
everything within becomes private.
Yeah,

2803
02:09:20,370 --> 02:09:22,240
it must be.
I think that's exactly what it is,

2804
02:09:22,241 --> 02:09:27,241
but there's a lot of like eastlands and 
a oryx and all these African animals and

2805
02:09:27,611 --> 02:09:28,444
the axis deer that have gone rogue.
They've gotten through fences and now 

2806
02:09:31,421 --> 02:09:33,700
they're just wild and free range.
Our Dad,

2807
02:09:33,760 --> 02:09:34,593
what do they call them in?

2808
02:09:34,610 --> 02:09:36,370
In New Zealand?
Convicts.

2809
02:09:37,180 --> 02:09:38,950
Escapees,
escapees.

2810
02:09:39,550 --> 02:09:42,400
I would.
That would be crazy if a cat got loose,

2811
02:09:42,430 --> 02:09:44,020
it could go nuts out there.
Right?

2812
02:09:44,070 --> 02:09:46,450
Oh Man.
I'm sure it's happened.

2813
02:09:46,510 --> 02:09:49,630
I'm sure if you drive down the road 
somewhere in Jasper,

2814
02:09:49,631 --> 02:09:52,140
Texas or something,
you see that tire.

2815
02:09:53,560 --> 02:09:55,930
Scariest thing in the world.
Tigers in Texas.

2816
02:09:55,931 --> 02:09:59,890
We don't even know how many there are.
I don't.

2817
02:09:59,891 --> 02:10:01,680
I.
I'm blown away right now.

2818
02:10:03,060 --> 02:10:04,190
I have a whole bit about it,
man.

2819
02:10:04,220 --> 02:10:07,340
She watched this come out of the woods.
This.

2820
02:10:07,910 --> 02:10:08,743
Yeah,
it's.

2821
02:10:09,160 --> 02:10:12,490
It's a very Texas a very odd place,
but what I wanted to highlight is like,

2822
02:10:12,760 --> 02:10:13,593
man,
you don't want that to be the only way 

2823
02:10:14,501 --> 02:10:16,540
you can get a hunting experience because
Texas is,

2824
02:10:16,830 --> 02:10:18,850
it's fucking weird.
We weren't,

2825
02:10:18,880 --> 02:10:20,140
we wouldn't have jobs,
man.

2826
02:10:20,200 --> 02:10:20,830
I mean,
yeah.

2827
02:10:20,830 --> 02:10:24,460
The reason for innovation is that 
competition,

2828
02:10:24,461 --> 02:10:27,400
that being outside,
pushing yourself,

2829
02:10:27,870 --> 02:10:28,703
you know,
climb,

2830
02:10:28,890 --> 02:10:29,890
uh,
new peaks.

2831
02:10:29,950 --> 02:10:30,783
Why is the hunting clothing industry 
like a bunch of fucking high school 

2832
02:10:33,351 --> 02:10:34,130
girls?

2833
02:10:34,130 --> 02:10:34,940
Because there's,
there's,

2834
02:10:34,940 --> 02:10:38,590
there's a lot of weirdness like cliques,
like if you were Sitka,

2835
02:10:38,600 --> 02:10:40,160
you're not supposed to wear cool.
You.

2836
02:10:40,161 --> 02:10:42,720
If you were cool you,
you're not supposed to wear firstly may.

2837
02:10:42,840 --> 02:10:43,673
I thought you were an under armour guy 
sitting over there with that first 

2838
02:10:46,041 --> 02:10:48,260
lectured on,
like what are you,

2839
02:10:48,261 --> 02:10:50,570
bunch of fucking girls,
high school girls.

2840
02:10:50,600 --> 02:10:53,150
Not that there's anything wrong with 
being a girl or being in high school.

2841
02:10:53,780 --> 02:10:55,280
I used to be in high school and every 
girl,

2842
02:10:55,281 --> 02:10:58,160
but I have no problem.
I'm glad you picked that to clear up,

2843
02:10:58,190 --> 02:11:00,180
but you know what I'm saying.
It's like fucking,

2844
02:11:00,190 --> 02:11:03,260
it's like a clicky little weird thing 
where they're on teams.

2845
02:11:03,261 --> 02:11:03,621
Like,
Hey,

2846
02:11:03,621 --> 02:11:05,570
there's,
there's no goddamn teams.

2847
02:11:05,970 --> 02:11:09,390
Like I had a conversation with one of 
the Sitka,

2848
02:11:09,570 --> 02:11:11,420
Harrison,
Jason Harrison found the,

2849
02:11:11,550 --> 02:11:13,700
you started out with Sitka and then he,
they,

2850
02:11:13,701 --> 02:11:14,534
you know,
they pushed them out and they bought it 

2851
02:11:15,621 --> 02:11:17,750
out and I'm sick of guys in the cool.

2852
02:11:17,750 --> 02:11:18,583
You guys don't get along.
Like you guys are out of your fucking 

2853
02:11:20,661 --> 02:11:23,680
minds.
This shit bro.

2854
02:11:23,720 --> 02:11:24,553
Staff thing.
Maybe that's where that green team 

2855
02:11:27,320 --> 02:11:28,131
mentality,
man,

2856
02:11:28,131 --> 02:11:31,070
it's the same thing as people from Texas
that don't like people from Wyoming,

2857
02:11:31,430 --> 02:11:32,001
you know?
It's like,

2858
02:11:32,001 --> 02:11:32,421
uh,
you know,

2859
02:11:32,421 --> 02:11:34,630
we played y'all in the folk and 
superbowl and kicked her.

2860
02:11:34,870 --> 02:11:38,150
It was really hard to believe.
I don't,

2861
02:11:38,180 --> 02:11:40,250
you know,
we're very friendly with.

2862
02:11:40,340 --> 02:11:42,260
Yeah,
you guys are you guys on.

2863
02:11:42,740 --> 02:11:43,573
I think it'd be real hard for me to 
believe that anybody's out there being 

2864
02:11:45,651 --> 02:11:46,580
like,
listen,

2865
02:11:46,700 --> 02:11:49,610
if you put this on,
you fucking hate those people.

2866
02:11:49,670 --> 02:11:51,610
Oh definitely.
There's people like that out there.

2867
02:11:51,670 --> 02:11:53,450
People kind of just pick it up and run 
with it.

2868
02:11:53,530 --> 02:11:54,363
Yeah.
Some,

2869
02:11:54,740 --> 02:11:57,500
I'm sure some people are ultra 
competitive and it comes from that,

2870
02:11:57,501 --> 02:11:59,510
like just the way it is in business,
right?

2871
02:11:59,511 --> 02:12:01,010
Instead of concentrating on what you're 
doing,

2872
02:12:01,011 --> 02:12:01,844
a lot of people concentrate on the other
people that are doing what you're doing 

2873
02:12:03,381 --> 02:12:03,680
in this.

2874
02:12:03,680 --> 02:12:06,750
These fuckers are trying to get us and 
we need it Vogan manner,

2875
02:12:07,220 --> 02:12:09,530
but the competition is good.
That's the good part.

2876
02:12:09,531 --> 02:12:10,090
Yeah.
Right.

2877
02:12:10,090 --> 02:12:10,923
Yeah.
The competition is amazing because you 

2878
02:12:11,901 --> 02:12:15,160
guys are constantly elevating your game.
Like I said,

2879
02:12:15,500 --> 02:12:16,333
Ryan,
I warrior stuff when I went to Nevada 

2880
02:12:18,921 --> 02:12:19,641
and it was like,
man,

2881
02:12:19,641 --> 02:12:22,840
those fucking.
What is the,

2882
02:12:23,010 --> 02:12:23,930
like the corrugated.
Yeah,

2883
02:12:23,931 --> 02:12:25,500
the corrugated guide pants.
This fucking,

2884
02:12:25,570 --> 02:12:27,440
they're great man.
They're so,

2885
02:12:27,441 --> 02:12:30,560
like loose,
like when you're walking in them,

2886
02:12:30,561 --> 02:12:34,130
there's no binding at all.
They're tough and durable and I'm like,

2887
02:12:34,131 --> 02:12:36,260
you guys nailed it.
You nailed it on a lot of stuff.

2888
02:12:36,750 --> 02:12:38,610
It's a cool system in that,
you know,

2889
02:12:38,611 --> 02:12:40,770
generally speaking you go to a few 
different shows,

2890
02:12:40,771 --> 02:12:44,220
like the outdoor retailer and whatever,
and you get to see all the best stuff,

2891
02:12:44,280 --> 02:12:47,090
right?
Like whether it be from the Albert,

2892
02:12:47,130 --> 02:12:49,070
Patagonia,
everything.

2893
02:12:49,470 --> 02:12:51,090
Um,
and you know,

2894
02:12:51,091 --> 02:12:54,420
you get to build the best thing you can 
build and there's like,

2895
02:12:54,620 --> 02:12:57,450
you know,
a couple of few companies that literally

2896
02:12:57,451 --> 02:13:00,390
like us,
that cost is no object.

2897
02:13:00,391 --> 02:13:01,224
I mean it's way down the list and I,
I wish we're making things as cheap as 

2898
02:13:03,961 --> 02:13:04,794
we can and that's still expensive,
but it's a fun thing to be able to make 

2899
02:13:07,530 --> 02:13:09,170
the best you can make.
Right.

2900
02:13:09,210 --> 02:13:11,910
And some people might say,
oh,

2901
02:13:11,911 --> 02:13:14,130
our steps better because we,
I don't know,

2902
02:13:14,131 --> 02:13:15,840
whatever it is,
what it is,

2903
02:13:15,870 --> 02:13:16,640
but

2904
02:13:16,640 --> 02:13:18,400
everything is so good now.
Yeah,

2905
02:13:18,401 --> 02:13:19,420
it's,
it's so great.

2906
02:13:19,610 --> 02:13:20,443
Selfishly we can make it first selves 
you so much better than when I started 

2907
02:13:24,501 --> 02:13:26,930
hunting in 2012,
which is incredible.

2908
02:13:26,960 --> 02:13:27,793
And the four and a half years that I've 
been hunting stuff has gotten a lot 

2909
02:13:29,901 --> 02:13:31,020
better.
It's,

2910
02:13:31,030 --> 02:13:32,280
that's really interesting.

2911
02:13:32,370 --> 02:13:33,280
That's awesome.
Yeah.

2912
02:13:33,450 --> 02:13:34,283
There's an accelerated curve out there 
of competition and innovation and it's 

2913
02:13:38,880 --> 02:13:39,713
for people that don't even hunt,
like you can get your stuff in solid 

2914
02:13:42,721 --> 02:13:46,590
colors and it is amazing outdoor where 
it's as good as you're going to get.

2915
02:13:46,591 --> 02:13:47,424
Like I have this,
this jacket that I was wearing the day 

2916
02:13:49,891 --> 02:13:51,560
when it's cold out and my wife was like,
what?

2917
02:13:51,570 --> 02:13:55,890
A ski and Jack and like firstlight joke 
and pitched because it was just black.

2918
02:13:56,610 --> 02:13:58,290
I'm like,
this is the warmest fucking jacket.

2919
02:13:58,291 --> 02:14:00,620
It's so light and so thin,
but you know,

2920
02:14:00,630 --> 02:14:01,261
it's.
What is it?

2921
02:14:01,261 --> 02:14:02,094
You're puffy.
So you guys got the uncompaghre a great 

2922
02:14:05,581 --> 02:14:06,640
jacket.
I mean it's just,

2923
02:14:06,690 --> 02:14:09,180
it's the perfect jacket for like when 
it's Kinda cold out.

2924
02:14:09,690 --> 02:14:12,960
And I wore that in Montana when I was 
doing on Anthony Bourdain show too.

2925
02:14:13,290 --> 02:14:16,020
I'm like,
it was fucking freezing out and I'm like

2926
02:14:16,021 --> 02:14:16,500
this Jack.

2927
02:14:16,500 --> 02:14:18,960
It's amazing.
It doesn't want nothing but a good time.

2928
02:14:18,961 --> 02:14:21,630
And Dan Bailey the pheasants forever.
Do who's good time.

2929
02:14:21,631 --> 02:14:26,631
And Dan bayless the way you say the 
nervous with the two.

2930
02:14:27,001 --> 02:14:29,730
He had the two griffons,
the two pointing dogs?

2931
02:14:29,820 --> 02:14:30,571
Yeah.
Oh,

2932
02:14:30,571 --> 02:14:31,540
okay.
Oh yeah.

2933
02:14:32,450 --> 02:14:34,020
Oh that's awesome man.
Yeah,

2934
02:14:34,021 --> 02:14:34,854
the bird fonting is fun,
but it's like way down on the list for 

2935
02:14:38,521 --> 02:14:39,321
me.
Well Dude,

2936
02:14:39,321 --> 02:14:40,154
you're skin you.
So we were talking about elk hunting in 

2937
02:14:43,081 --> 02:14:44,040
Idaho.
Yeah,

2938
02:14:45,290 --> 02:14:46,500
we're doing that.
When we doing that,

2939
02:14:46,540 --> 02:14:47,730
here's some time out.
Okay.

2940
02:14:47,760 --> 02:14:48,650
Well,
it's hard to give you some.

2941
02:14:49,100 --> 02:14:50,370
I've got kids.
I've got a wife.

2942
02:14:50,670 --> 02:14:53,070
Everybody's bitching at me.
I've heard of those things.

2943
02:14:53,340 --> 02:14:55,930
Yeah.
Fights those battles all the time.

2944
02:14:55,931 --> 02:14:58,750
You've managed to stay clean.
Ken's got restrictions right now.

2945
02:14:58,830 --> 02:15:00,930
Donald Trump has made your house to 
swear free zone.

2946
02:15:00,931 --> 02:15:02,130
Is that what you were saying?
That wow,

2947
02:15:02,140 --> 02:15:02,800
what happened?

2948
02:15:02,800 --> 02:15:05,970
I to my wife might not have the same 
political views.

2949
02:15:05,971 --> 02:15:09,120
So if we've gotten pretty uh,
uh,

2950
02:15:09,150 --> 02:15:12,420
was it the grab 'em by the pussy talks 
that he pushed her over the top.

2951
02:15:12,480 --> 02:15:17,480
It did me no favors as far as having a 
house that was free loose.

2952
02:15:17,640 --> 02:15:19,980
Do you have boys or girls?
Two boys and a girl.

2953
02:15:20,010 --> 02:15:20,461
Oh,
okay.

2954
02:15:20,461 --> 02:15:21,460
You're lucky.
Yeah.

2955
02:15:21,560 --> 02:15:22,393
He's just like a balance there.
Girls and two boys in your house and 

2956
02:15:25,261 --> 02:15:26,000
then you.
Oh,

2957
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:26,940
for me,
dude,

2958
02:15:26,941 --> 02:15:27,774
it's all chicks.
My fucking whole house overrun by 

2959
02:15:29,590 --> 02:15:30,930
checks.
And my mom,

2960
02:15:30,960 --> 02:15:33,620
my wife's mom lives nearby.
She's over the,

2961
02:15:33,690 --> 02:15:35,850
over the fucking house too.
It's all women.

2962
02:15:36,270 --> 02:15:38,970
All women.
You get a lot of times women.

2963
02:15:38,971 --> 02:15:39,804
Yeah.
Daddy's going to go outside and pretend 

2964
02:15:40,621 --> 02:15:44,200
he's still a man.
Fucking hide.

2965
02:15:46,270 --> 02:15:50,670
Sirens trying to bring you to the rocks.
It's funny though,

2966
02:15:50,800 --> 02:15:52,170
you know.
So what,

2967
02:15:52,190 --> 02:15:54,420
what laws to get established in your 
household?

2968
02:15:54,540 --> 02:15:55,470
Oh,
I don't know,

2969
02:15:55,471 --> 02:15:56,580
you know,
it just,

2970
02:15:56,650 --> 02:16:00,540
uh,
we just have to be concerned with what,

2971
02:16:00,590 --> 02:16:01,090
what,
what,

2972
02:16:01,090 --> 02:16:03,600
what we say doesn't,
isn't it negative?

2973
02:16:03,630 --> 02:16:06,020
How did Donald Trump bring this about?
I don't know.

2974
02:16:06,030 --> 02:16:07,170
I think,
like you said,

2975
02:16:07,171 --> 02:16:08,670
I think there was enough.
Like,

2976
02:16:08,671 --> 02:16:10,170
you know,
I have two boys,

2977
02:16:10,171 --> 02:16:12,480
right?
So they're not afraid to call each other

2978
02:16:12,481 --> 02:16:14,300
a pussy if some things go.
You know what I mean?

2979
02:16:14,790 --> 02:16:16,290
They heard on the news.
Yeah,

2980
02:16:16,490 --> 02:16:17,221
no,
but they're,

2981
02:16:17,221 --> 02:16:18,054
you know,
they're into their extreme sporty and 

2982
02:16:20,311 --> 02:16:21,930
they're skiers mountain bikers.
Then,

2983
02:16:21,931 --> 02:16:23,910
you know,
inevitably it's like,

2984
02:16:23,940 --> 02:16:24,773
you know,
there's the jump built or something and 

2985
02:16:25,621 --> 02:16:27,300
first thing like it's called,
as,

2986
02:16:27,301 --> 02:16:29,580
you know,
the p right?

2987
02:16:29,590 --> 02:16:30,020
Pass them

2988
02:16:30,020 --> 02:16:30,581
out.
Plan.

2989
02:16:30,581 --> 02:16:31,930
That was the first thing.
I was like,

2990
02:16:31,970 --> 02:16:33,510
no,
no,

2991
02:16:33,670 --> 02:16:34,840
no,
no,

2992
02:16:35,140 --> 02:16:37,400
you're a Dick Dick,
do you like that?

2993
02:16:37,401 --> 02:16:38,081
And I was like,
whoa.

2994
02:16:38,081 --> 02:16:39,730
She's serious.
Like she did not.

2995
02:16:40,090 --> 02:16:42,400
That was not going to be a derogatory 
term and that's fine.

2996
02:16:42,401 --> 02:16:44,290
Whatever it shouldn't be,
but you know,

2997
02:16:44,291 --> 02:16:47,080
it was funny because you know,
they'll heckle each other and you know,

2998
02:16:47,081 --> 02:16:47,914
they're boys.
They all,

2999
02:16:47,960 --> 02:16:51,250
they want to get after some nasty 
gnarly.

3000
02:16:51,251 --> 02:16:52,480
Yes.
You know,

3001
02:16:52,481 --> 02:16:53,314
jump or whatever on their bikes and 
somebody's got a Guinea pig it and sure 

3002
02:16:55,961 --> 02:16:58,360
enough it's probably the one that got 
called a pussy first.

3003
02:16:58,361 --> 02:17:00,450
Right.
So we don't do well for my,

3004
02:17:00,510 --> 02:17:02,080
for me,
when Donald Trump,

3005
02:17:02,140 --> 02:17:02,973
the whole story came out.
It was great because then all of a 

3006
02:17:04,691 --> 02:17:05,524
sudden everybody,
so many people are saying pussy and it 

3007
02:17:07,440 --> 02:17:08,273
seems like this country's like backing.
We had gotten some weird politically 

3008
02:17:12,341 --> 02:17:16,780
correct phase just in the last couple of
years where people are so mad at so many

3009
02:17:16,781 --> 02:17:17,614
different.

3010
02:17:17,710 --> 02:17:18,543
Different groups are so mad at the way 
our culture is that there was all these 

3011
02:17:22,781 --> 02:17:23,614
words you weren't allowed to say anymore
and there was all these new things like 

3012
02:17:26,170 --> 02:17:29,220
you're not allowed to wear sombreros 
because it's cultural appropriation.

3013
02:17:29,221 --> 02:17:31,840
They were getting mad at people for 
cooking other cultures,

3014
02:17:31,841 --> 02:17:32,674
dishes,
like people got so politically correct 

3015
02:17:34,510 --> 02:17:35,343
that like the good thing about Donald 
trump being in office is that I said 

3016
02:17:38,650 --> 02:17:39,483
that political correctness is just took 
a missile to the Deq because like that 

3017
02:17:43,240 --> 02:17:46,170
guy as the fucking commander in chief 
man,

3018
02:17:46,210 --> 02:17:47,710
that political correctness shit,
it's like,

3019
02:17:47,711 --> 02:17:50,320
it doesn't seem very effective.
It didn't work here.

3020
02:17:50,530 --> 02:17:52,600
Like you can't,
you can't and people are fighting and of

3021
02:17:52,601 --> 02:17:54,940
course in rallying and protesting and 
all that jazz.

3022
02:17:55,390 --> 02:17:57,250
But it.
The good thing about,

3023
02:17:57,270 --> 02:17:58,630
it's like you realize like,
oh,

3024
02:17:58,631 --> 02:18:01,390
that's just a word like pussies.
Just a word.

3025
02:18:01,420 --> 02:18:03,670
Like in that guy was saying pussy,
now he's the president.

3026
02:18:03,690 --> 02:18:07,630
Like it's not really like this is like 
taboo word that summons demons,

3027
02:18:07,631 --> 02:18:08,160
you know,
it's,

3028
02:18:08,160 --> 02:18:11,050
it's just a word and its intent.
That's important.

3029
02:18:11,200 --> 02:18:12,033
It's not demonizing words and making 
these words impossible to say because 

3030
02:18:15,851 --> 02:18:16,684
we've made them like,
there's certain words now that you just 

3031
02:18:18,611 --> 02:18:22,900
can't say in our culture or people get 
upset at you that were real common.

3032
02:18:22,901 --> 02:18:24,700
Like retard.
He calls someone to retard.

3033
02:18:24,701 --> 02:18:27,040
You're not saying someone has a disease.
You know,

3034
02:18:27,041 --> 02:18:27,874
you're,
you're saying someone's a fucking 

3035
02:18:28,400 --> 02:18:29,810
knucklehead,
all the cars retarded.

3036
02:18:30,080 --> 02:18:32,500
You,
you know the intent of that word,

3037
02:18:32,560 --> 02:18:33,520
but people are saying,
no,

3038
02:18:33,521 --> 02:18:35,800
don't say that anymore.
That's offensive will.

3039
02:18:35,801 --> 02:18:36,634
The more you create offensive words and 
the more you create words that are not 

3040
02:18:41,020 --> 02:18:42,340
there,
you're not allowed to say them.

3041
02:18:42,550 --> 02:18:44,980
The more you get to give those words 
power and people are going to,

3042
02:18:45,030 --> 02:18:46,480
they can't wait to se them.

3043
02:18:46,810 --> 02:18:47,643
They can't.
Then those words become like nuclear 

3044
02:18:50,340 --> 02:18:52,240
nuclear option.
Then you've got something right.

3045
02:18:52,560 --> 02:18:55,180
You've got the c word,
you know it's,

3046
02:18:55,210 --> 02:18:57,040
you're always holding onto that one for 
chickens.

3047
02:18:57,041 --> 02:18:58,160
Crazy.
You know,

3048
02:18:58,250 --> 02:19:02,320
like listen,
like that.

3049
02:19:02,680 --> 02:19:03,513
It's impossible to come back from.
There's not an equivalent word for men 

3050
02:19:06,520 --> 02:19:09,050
like bike telling us.
We can't say that word.

3051
02:19:09,051 --> 02:19:09,884
You can call it dicks all day long.
You fucking Dick App guilty as charged 

3052
02:19:12,770 --> 02:19:16,910
on tv now practically that you can.
It's as long as it's not like a,

3053
02:19:17,410 --> 02:19:19,080
you know,
I mean I think like NBC,

3054
02:19:19,130 --> 02:19:21,010
CBS,
they still don't use it,

3055
02:19:21,070 --> 02:19:23,410
but like any cable show they use that.
Now.

3056
02:19:23,710 --> 02:19:24,543
All I know is Kenton's wife tends to 
look at me like that is the source of 

3057
02:19:29,510 --> 02:19:32,930
looseness right there.
That's single man with a mustache.

3058
02:19:34,280 --> 02:19:37,130
This man got cut loose to spend too much
time with him.

3059
02:19:37,130 --> 02:19:38,270
It could all go down.
Uh,

3060
02:19:38,440 --> 02:19:40,370
just go feral.
Yeah.

3061
02:19:40,640 --> 02:19:41,271
What's,
why.

3062
02:19:41,271 --> 02:19:42,104
Like no one tells Ryan were to go.
Ryan can just go into the woods anytime 

3063
02:19:44,811 --> 02:19:45,950
he wants.
I don't think that's right.

3064
02:19:46,080 --> 02:19:46,913
Yeah.
What about he doesn't have a leash on 

3065
02:19:48,380 --> 02:19:52,390
how many times did he call and check was
just out there with no leash collar.

3066
02:19:52,520 --> 02:19:54,410
I get a long leash.
I get along,

3067
02:19:54,470 --> 02:19:57,030
especially during hunting season,
but mark might still elite.

3068
02:19:57,270 --> 02:19:59,420
You have a leash.
Brian doesn't have elite.

3069
02:19:59,470 --> 02:20:01,310
She's just asked him.
He doesn't have to call anybody.

3070
02:20:01,311 --> 02:20:03,110
He just goes where he wants it is what 
it is.

3071
02:20:03,350 --> 02:20:05,780
But if he just decides to take that 
mustache and go for a hike,

3072
02:20:06,650 --> 02:20:09,230
nobody can tell them that.
That,

3073
02:20:09,380 --> 02:20:11,750
that pisses women off because then then 
demand goes,

3074
02:20:11,870 --> 02:20:12,830
yeah.
Hey,

3075
02:20:13,010 --> 02:20:16,070
Ryan says healthy with no leash still 
whenever he wants.

3076
02:20:16,220 --> 02:20:17,630
I wish I was like that.

3077
02:20:18,230 --> 02:20:19,970
Like I love being married.
I love having kids.

3078
02:20:19,971 --> 02:20:21,410
I love the whole day.
I love having a family,

3079
02:20:22,460 --> 02:20:24,650
but I got a buddy,
my friend,

3080
02:20:24,651 --> 02:20:25,880
Ari.
You know what already did?

3081
02:20:26,120 --> 02:20:28,220
He just went off the grid,
shut his fucking phone off.

3082
02:20:28,610 --> 02:20:31,280
He won't answer his emails.
He just disappeared.

3083
02:20:31,550 --> 02:20:34,970
He went to Pacific.
Just want to do it for a few months.

3084
02:20:35,170 --> 02:20:36,860
He's a.
he's a stand up comic.

3085
02:20:36,950 --> 02:20:37,783
Hilarious guy.
Successful show on comedy central is 

3086
02:20:39,531 --> 02:20:40,760
doing great.
Kicking ass.

3087
02:20:41,090 --> 02:20:42,050
He just decided,
you know what?

3088
02:20:42,170 --> 02:20:44,280
I need some experiences in my life to 
write about,

3089
02:20:44,300 --> 02:20:45,133
to talk about,
so I'm just going to fucking stop 

3090
02:20:46,281 --> 02:20:47,940
talking to people and disappear for a 
few months ago.

3091
02:20:47,950 --> 02:20:50,960
I talked to him in two months.
I haven't talked to him.

3092
02:20:50,961 --> 02:20:52,970
I don't know where the fuck is.
You call his voicemail.

3093
02:20:53,120 --> 02:20:56,780
It just says the subscriber you have 
reached to shut off incoming call.

3094
02:20:57,260 --> 02:20:59,180
That's amazing,
dude.

3095
02:20:59,181 --> 02:21:04,181
This thing is just the most devious 
creation on the planet earth.

3096
02:21:06,080 --> 02:21:07,340
It is.
It is

3097
02:21:07,920 --> 02:21:08,753
scribers request.
This phone does not accept incoming 

3098
02:21:11,621 --> 02:21:14,590
calls.
Message and V,

3099
02:21:14,770 --> 02:21:15,603
one

3100
02:21:16,520 --> 02:21:18,480
rockin message.
<Unk>.

3101
02:21:18,920 --> 02:21:22,880
It doesn't give a fuck if my wife heard 
that.

3102
02:21:22,881 --> 02:21:24,120
Well,
he's out there.

3103
02:21:25,160 --> 02:21:29,450
You think that's good?
He's got no one to call in to check in,

3104
02:21:29,840 --> 02:21:32,010
but he can check in and do whatever he 
wants,

3105
02:21:32,020 --> 02:21:33,950
but he wants everything cool.
Yeah.

3106
02:21:33,980 --> 02:21:34,610
Right.
Late.

3107
02:21:34,610 --> 02:21:35,400
She can call me up.
Hey,

3108
02:21:35,400 --> 02:21:36,233
faggot.
I'm still alive and then hang up the 

3109
02:21:36,711 --> 02:21:37,520
phone.
That's it.

3110
02:21:37,520 --> 02:21:38,380
I'm like,
God,

3111
02:21:38,470 --> 02:21:39,080
listen.

3112
02:21:39,080 --> 02:21:41,270
Yeah.
The ability to checkout.

3113
02:21:41,980 --> 02:21:44,440
We can.
I mean where we are,

3114
02:21:45,010 --> 02:21:48,910
it is narrow valley public land 
everywhere.

3115
02:21:49,450 --> 02:21:50,283
As soon as you get off the valley floor,
you're on public land like we talked 

3116
02:21:52,331 --> 02:21:53,170
about.
I can hate.

3117
02:21:53,560 --> 02:21:55,300
I can hate to the fricking Yukon,
man.

3118
02:21:55,810 --> 02:21:56,643
That's crazy and you can be disconnected
as disconnected as you want to be and 

3119
02:22:02,200 --> 02:22:07,200
there is no price tag on that.
That and I need.

3120
02:22:07,920 --> 02:22:10,560
Well that's the constant dilemma amongst
a lot of hunters,

3121
02:22:10,561 --> 02:22:11,394
especially the really hardcore guys.
A lot of the podcast that I listened to 

3122
02:22:13,351 --> 02:22:14,184
like a bunch of them,
but the big dilemma is how much time 

3123
02:22:17,821 --> 02:22:21,240
does your family allow you to get out?
How much?

3124
02:22:21,270 --> 02:22:24,840
How much time can you spend?
Can you do one of those 30 day trips?

3125
02:22:25,170 --> 02:22:26,003
You know,
like there's a lot of guys that do like 

3126
02:22:26,910 --> 02:22:30,360
a 30 day trip that's pretty heavy.
That's a heavy as fuck,

3127
02:22:30,361 --> 02:22:33,290
but there's some street cred to that or 
should I say trail cred.

3128
02:22:33,820 --> 02:22:35,070
Right,
right.

3129
02:22:36,200 --> 02:22:36,940
Like,
you know,

3130
02:22:36,940 --> 02:22:38,850
I'm fucking Raylynn said to me once,
it was really funny,

3131
02:22:38,851 --> 02:22:39,720
man.
We were laughing.

3132
02:22:39,721 --> 02:22:40,554
We were talking about grizzly man.
We're talking about the Werner Herzog 

3133
02:22:42,181 --> 02:22:44,180
documentary and Rinella was.
He goes,

3134
02:22:44,340 --> 02:22:45,720
I'll tell you what though.
He goes,

3135
02:22:45,870 --> 02:22:48,420
that guy did some fucking hard camping.
He goes,

3136
02:22:48,421 --> 02:22:49,254
I got to respect that guy.
That guy was a hard camper coming from 

3137
02:22:53,140 --> 02:22:58,140
things the hard way it no one loves the 
way more than Manila.

3138
02:22:58,950 --> 02:23:00,040
He loves it.
Yeah,

3139
02:23:00,060 --> 02:23:00,810
he does.

3140
02:23:00,810 --> 02:23:01,643
Yeah,
but there's something to be said for it 

3141
02:23:02,581 --> 02:23:05,190
because just like we were talking about,
you know,

3142
02:23:05,191 --> 02:23:06,024
things get more pc or whatever.
It's you start patting yourself and all 

3143
02:23:09,931 --> 02:23:11,970
of a sudden you don't know what rough 
is.

3144
02:23:12,080 --> 02:23:13,490
Safe spaces.
NERF,

3145
02:23:13,491 --> 02:23:14,324
the hard edges of the world.
It's super important that we'd be 

3146
02:23:16,071 --> 02:23:16,904
totally inclusive.
Competition is not a bad thing and 

3147
02:23:19,491 --> 02:23:20,324
there's no more primal competition than 
you trying to go out and get your own 

3148
02:23:23,511 --> 02:23:27,610
food that's running around trying to 
stay alive and what do you have?

3149
02:23:27,630 --> 02:23:28,463
You got a pointy stick.
You're trying to shoot another 

3150
02:23:30,310 --> 02:23:31,143
concession.

3151
02:23:31,530 --> 02:23:34,530
Every time a hunter goes into the woods,
something dies.

3152
02:23:34,710 --> 02:23:36,750
That's what I.
that's what I hear all the time.

3153
02:23:36,751 --> 02:23:37,530
It's like,
well,

3154
02:23:37,530 --> 02:23:40,890
I saw five people go into the woods 
behind my house on a public easement.

3155
02:23:40,980 --> 02:23:41,813
I was at a city council meeting 
listening to this Gal talk somebody 

3156
02:23:47,700 --> 02:23:50,730
public easement so people can access 
public land.

3157
02:23:51,330 --> 02:23:52,163
Only way their housing development got 
built was so that because they allowed 

3158
02:23:55,081 --> 02:23:57,780
to easements so people could get to the 
public land.

3159
02:23:58,290 --> 02:24:01,530
She's saying that five people went past 
her house and five elk died.

3160
02:24:02,230 --> 02:24:04,260
It's like not the case.
I'll tell you right now.

3161
02:24:04,261 --> 02:24:05,094
It's never happened.
I don't punch my tag until the absolute 

3162
02:24:07,531 --> 02:24:11,550
last day because as soon as I clip it,
I gotta be back into work.

3163
02:24:14,400 --> 02:24:15,233
Yeah,
I mean I've had conversations with 

3164
02:24:15,851 --> 02:24:17,170
people that don't understand the like,
you know,

3165
02:24:17,171 --> 02:24:18,460
you go out there and you shoot these 
animals.

3166
02:24:18,461 --> 02:24:18,851
I go,
no,

3167
02:24:18,851 --> 02:24:20,890
you go out there and you try to get an 
animal.

3168
02:24:21,160 --> 02:24:22,900
She's like,
well how often are you successful?

3169
02:24:22,901 --> 02:24:23,201
I said,
well,

3170
02:24:23,201 --> 02:24:26,650
I went on 500 slabs and I'm super 
dedicated practice constantly.

3171
02:24:26,651 --> 02:24:28,870
I'm absorbed in it.
Five hundred,

3172
02:24:28,871 --> 02:24:31,240
three of them aren't successful,
so that's.

3173
02:24:31,241 --> 02:24:33,790
And that's a good,
that's a good average.

3174
02:24:33,960 --> 02:24:36,050
So you're spending 15,
you know,

3175
02:24:36,051 --> 02:24:36,884
like each,
each hunt at least five days out in the 

3176
02:24:38,501 --> 02:24:40,990
woods and just nothing.
Sorry,

3177
02:24:41,110 --> 02:24:43,960
come back home mouth and struck out and 
go,

3178
02:24:44,110 --> 02:24:45,910
oh,
that was an absolute failure.

3179
02:24:45,940 --> 02:24:50,290
My kids looking at me like such a loser.
Nothing like nothing struck out like you

3180
02:24:50,291 --> 02:24:51,130
didn't,
nothing,

3181
02:24:51,540 --> 02:24:52,720
nothing,
nothing.

3182
02:24:52,721 --> 02:24:53,554
You little.
Yeah.

3183
02:24:53,620 --> 02:24:54,520
Yeah.
Figure that out.

3184
02:24:54,521 --> 02:24:56,770
That car company can come with me one 
day.

3185
02:24:56,770 --> 02:24:58,300
Right now you're too little to hike.
Kyla,

3186
02:24:58,930 --> 02:25:01,800
what are the ages?
Six and eight are getting close.

3187
02:25:01,990 --> 02:25:03,400
They love.
They eat everything though,

3188
02:25:03,401 --> 02:25:04,990
man.
They've eaten bear elk.

3189
02:25:04,991 --> 02:25:05,824
The elk all the time.
Maybe they've been eating wild game 

3190
02:25:07,931 --> 02:25:08,764
since they were little.
They know they don't know the 

3191
02:25:10,061 --> 02:25:11,350
difference.
They like it.

3192
02:25:11,730 --> 02:25:15,260
They're both scanning.
Scan since they were two nice.

3193
02:25:15,870 --> 02:25:19,130
I took them when they're just so little 
that they just pizza down the window.

3194
02:25:19,210 --> 02:25:22,480
They had the little connector with the 
two skis and they just slide.

3195
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:25,210
My name is Rosie.
I don't even think she was too.

3196
02:25:25,980 --> 02:25:27,100
You have a rosy?
Yeah,

3197
02:25:27,130 --> 02:25:28,270
no way.
No Way.

3198
02:25:28,400 --> 02:25:28,900
Oh No.
Well,

3199
02:25:28,900 --> 02:25:30,300
because Steve Daughter at.
Yeah,

3200
02:25:30,350 --> 02:25:31,183
yeah,
yeah,

3201
02:25:31,560 --> 02:25:32,393
yeah.
Kids are,

3202
02:25:32,740 --> 02:25:33,573
you know,
it's an amazing thing to have a little 

3203
02:25:34,991 --> 02:25:35,824
person that you're raising and you get 
to see them learning things for the 

3204
02:25:39,250 --> 02:25:41,170
first time,
which will never happen again.

3205
02:25:41,830 --> 02:25:42,663
You know,
everything they learned for the first 

3206
02:25:43,691 --> 02:25:44,411
time,
like every,

3207
02:25:44,411 --> 02:25:45,244
the first time they went skiing.
I remember the this look on their face 

3208
02:25:47,141 --> 02:25:50,050
like we've got the mittens on like this 
is crazy.

3209
02:25:50,290 --> 02:25:51,123
I've got a helmet on.
Whether they're so happy and excited 

3210
02:25:53,321 --> 02:25:55,180
like there's never gonna be a first like
that again.

3211
02:25:55,420 --> 02:25:58,270
And the more first you can have in this 
life,

3212
02:25:58,271 --> 02:26:00,490
I think the better and more rich your 
life will be.

3213
02:26:00,760 --> 02:26:01,593
The more experiences,
the more times you can learn thing and 

3214
02:26:03,941 --> 02:26:04,774
people get locked into these patterns in
their life and I don't know why it 

3215
02:26:08,081 --> 02:26:13,081
happens and I don't know what causes it,
but we get a job and we get a career and

3216
02:26:13,301 --> 02:26:16,060
we get a path and a neighborhood and 
that's boom,

3217
02:26:16,090 --> 02:26:16,923
and then the first stop,
there's no more firsts and then it 

3218
02:26:19,571 --> 02:26:20,404
becomes the same shit over and over 
again in life becomes mundane and life 

3219
02:26:23,681 --> 02:26:28,240
becomes tired and grow old in a lot of 
ways other than aging,

3220
02:26:28,480 --> 02:26:33,460
but the other thing that happens is you 
realize that this is what's going on and

3221
02:26:33,461 --> 02:26:34,990
then you seek novelty.

3222
02:26:35,050 --> 02:26:40,050
You seek new experiences and hopefully 
that's what happens to more people more.

3223
02:26:40,391 --> 02:26:42,750
When they listened to podcasts like this
and they,

3224
02:26:42,751 --> 02:26:43,584
they,
they hear you guys talk about your 

3225
02:26:44,231 --> 02:26:46,360
experiences and they said,
God damn it.

3226
02:26:46,361 --> 02:26:47,680
I need some of that in my life.
You know,

3227
02:26:47,681 --> 02:26:50,860
I need.
I need to just go fucking camp.

3228
02:26:51,160 --> 02:26:55,150
I need to just go out there.
I need to wake up and hear bulls bugling

3229
02:26:56,840 --> 02:26:57,673
and I need to wake up and hear birds 
that I don't recognize Turpin and 

3230
02:27:01,571 --> 02:27:04,540
squawking and look over the ridge and 
see a bear.

3231
02:27:04,610 --> 02:27:05,443
I'm like,
whoa.

3232
02:27:05,490 --> 02:27:07,480
The fuck is that.
That's a wild bear.

3233
02:27:07,481 --> 02:27:08,500
It's just hanging out,
chilling,

3234
02:27:08,530 --> 02:27:09,363
being,
doing bare stuff like all that stuff is 

3235
02:27:11,220 --> 02:27:15,580
like having new experiences like that.
It's just giant for your life and again,

3236
02:27:15,581 --> 02:27:18,340
if you're not in a hunting,
you don't even want to go try archery.

3237
02:27:18,400 --> 02:27:19,690
Just try that.
Just try that.

3238
02:27:19,691 --> 02:27:21,550
Just a new experience.
Call somewhere,

3239
02:27:21,580 --> 02:27:22,890
find a place that gives lessons.
Oh,

3240
02:27:22,900 --> 02:27:23,733
just go drive out the national park,
drive out to bears ears national 

3241
02:27:28,121 --> 02:27:30,360
monument.
Check some things out.

3242
02:27:30,370 --> 02:27:31,203
That road trip car camping is fantastic.
Are to get people out of their comfort 

3243
02:27:35,480 --> 02:27:37,780
zone.
Part might be steps,

3244
02:27:37,781 --> 02:27:38,740
man.
Go do it.

3245
02:27:39,100 --> 02:27:39,980
Go do it.
Get out there.

3246
02:27:40,380 --> 02:27:42,760
One of the most fulfilling things I do,
I try to do.

3247
02:27:42,850 --> 02:27:43,683
Take somebody out on their first time 
every year and it is one of the most 

3248
02:27:46,271 --> 02:27:51,271
fulfilling things I do every year.
I'm sure it's just the best.

3249
02:27:51,900 --> 02:27:53,530
Well,
it always blows somebody's mind.

3250
02:27:54,160 --> 02:27:56,500
I mean all you have to do is hear a 
vehicle and people are just like,

3251
02:27:56,501 --> 02:27:57,750
whoa.
Yeah,

3252
02:27:57,960 --> 02:27:59,350
I mean it doesn't sound like a real 
animal.

3253
02:27:59,650 --> 02:28:00,483
Jamie.
Queue up some elk bugle because for 

3254
02:28:02,351 --> 02:28:03,184
people who've never heard it before,
they don't know what the fuck we're 

3255
02:28:04,331 --> 02:28:05,830
talking about.
You live in a city somewhere,

3256
02:28:05,831 --> 02:28:06,664
you poor bastard.
It sounds like an animal from the Lord 

3257
02:28:08,531 --> 02:28:10,390
of the rings.
It doesn't sound like a real thing.

3258
02:28:10,700 --> 02:28:13,180
It sounds like some crazy exotic bees.

3259
02:28:18,970 --> 02:28:21,890
Is that a good one?
Heard a little bit of it.

3260
02:28:22,100 --> 02:28:23,360
Did you just pick the first one you 
found?

3261
02:28:27,200 --> 02:28:29,810
Now that's not even like a crazy one 
that's like,

3262
02:28:29,820 --> 02:28:30,653
that sounds like a little bitch bull.
But this is a 1000 pound forest horse 

3263
02:28:35,750 --> 02:28:36,583
that's making me.

3264
02:28:38,750 --> 02:28:40,240
That's a real bull right there,
baby.

3265
02:28:42,970 --> 02:28:46,780
That guy is like,
I get all the pussy.

3266
02:28:52,950 --> 02:28:53,570
No,

3267
02:28:53,570 --> 02:28:54,403
look at him screaming and then they 
throw their head back and just launched 

3268
02:28:58,341 --> 02:29:00,880
that in the end.
So these guys are going back

3269
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:01,990
fourth in this video.

3270
02:29:05,670 --> 02:29:07,170
What a crazy animal.
It is.

3271
02:29:07,171 --> 02:29:08,004
Not something you get sick of hearing.
Never met every time I've been elk 

3272
02:29:11,791 --> 02:29:12,624
hunting and I've been elk hunting a few 
times now you see one and you hear it 

3273
02:29:15,631 --> 02:29:17,880
and just your whole body like tingles.
It's like,

3274
02:29:17,881 --> 02:29:18,714
Whoa,
what a magical experience to just be 

3275
02:29:22,141 --> 02:29:24,090
around those things,
to feel bad,

3276
02:29:24,360 --> 02:29:27,510
to feel that noise in your chest.
Jesus to the size of that fucker.

3277
02:29:27,590 --> 02:29:29,480
Yeah.
God,

3278
02:29:31,200 --> 02:29:32,033
I mean the things that are keeping those
things alive or the money that comes 

3279
02:29:36,360 --> 02:29:37,193
from hunting,
that's super important for people to 

3280
02:29:38,731 --> 02:29:39,564
recognize.
There was a time in this country with 

3281
02:29:40,561 --> 02:29:43,500
those things were almost extinct in the 
early 19 hundreds.

3282
02:29:43,501 --> 02:29:45,360
There was very few.
There's very few deer.

3283
02:29:45,570 --> 02:29:46,403
There's very few anything and now 
there's more deer in this country than 

3284
02:29:48,361 --> 02:29:50,760
the war.
When Columbus didn't discover this place

3285
02:29:50,850 --> 02:29:53,100
and that's why people are so passionate 
about this man.

3286
02:29:53,100 --> 02:29:55,320
Look at the history like we've landed.
We said,

3287
02:29:55,321 --> 02:29:57,540
hey,
this place is going to be different than

3288
02:29:57,541 --> 02:29:58,374
where we came from.
The land or the animals belong to the 

3289
02:30:01,291 --> 02:30:04,770
people.
We fucked that up real quick with market

3290
02:30:04,771 --> 02:30:05,581
hunting.
Yeah.

3291
02:30:05,581 --> 02:30:09,230
Market hunting is an interesting thing 
that most people don't.

3292
02:30:09,270 --> 02:30:10,860
Didn't even know that that was a real 
thing.

3293
02:30:10,861 --> 02:30:12,420
They know that we kill off all the 
buffalo,

3294
02:30:12,421 --> 02:30:16,330
but they don't really understand that 
back in the day before refrigerators and

3295
02:30:16,420 --> 02:30:18,540
you got to get meat like pretty much 
then.

3296
02:30:18,780 --> 02:30:22,680
Yes,
a man read Michener's chesapeake,

3297
02:30:23,060 --> 02:30:26,520
that there's a great description on 
market hunting in the Chesapeake Bay.

3298
02:30:26,550 --> 02:30:30,390
Guys going out with a low profile boats 
with cannons on them,

3299
02:30:30,720 --> 02:30:33,390
stuffing them full of shards and nails 
and stuff,

3300
02:30:33,391 --> 02:30:38,391
and they'd go up to these big rafts they
called when ducks and geese sleep in the

3301
02:30:39,840 --> 02:30:40,920
middle of the night on big bodies of 
water.

3302
02:30:40,980 --> 02:30:45,980
They all get huddled up together and the
on this is in the Chesapeake Bay,

3303
02:30:46,650 --> 02:30:49,770
but it happened in the Great Lakes.
Also big rafts of birds.

3304
02:30:50,280 --> 02:30:52,410
And uh,
you would,

3305
02:30:52,600 --> 02:30:54,270
you know,
push off in the middle of the night,

3306
02:30:54,870 --> 02:30:55,703
sneak up really slowly on these big 
rafts of sleeping birds and touch this 

3307
02:30:59,941 --> 02:31:01,620
cannon off.
Shoot this cannon.

3308
02:31:02,280 --> 02:31:03,113
And then,
and that's how the Chesapeake Bay 

3309
02:31:05,011 --> 02:31:05,844
retriever was a basically bred into 
existence was they needed a big hearty 

3310
02:31:10,501 --> 02:31:15,501
dog that could withstand cold water.
This dog would spend hours never getting

3311
02:31:16,261 --> 02:31:19,470
back in the boat,
but just constantly retrieving for hours

3312
02:31:19,630 --> 02:31:19,980
because they'd

3313
02:31:19,980 --> 02:31:20,910
shoot,
you know,

3314
02:31:21,240 --> 02:31:24,880
and probably a mouthful of nails,
200 birds.

3315
02:31:24,900 --> 02:31:28,740
Right.
And then that dog had to then sit on the

3316
02:31:28,741 --> 02:31:31,620
pile at birds and defend it the next 
day.

3317
02:31:32,250 --> 02:31:33,030
Everybody else.
Right.

3318
02:31:33,030 --> 02:31:36,150
Because those burgers are worth money.
So they were taking them across to a.

3319
02:31:36,310 --> 02:31:38,920
So they had to be guide dogs or guard 
dogs rather.

3320
02:31:38,980 --> 02:31:40,930
And they also had to be retrievers.
Yes.

3321
02:31:41,120 --> 02:31:42,100
Whoa.
Yeah.

3322
02:31:42,640 --> 02:31:43,473
Whoa.
And then they would bring those to 

3323
02:31:44,321 --> 02:31:45,154
market by the barrel full and that's an.
They were only good for a couple of 

3324
02:31:48,910 --> 02:31:49,600
days.
Yeah.

3325
02:31:49,600 --> 02:31:50,400
People would,
you know,

3326
02:31:50,400 --> 02:31:53,050
they would try to keep them cool.
And then people try to buy them as quick

3327
02:31:53,051 --> 02:31:53,884
as they could before they spoiled and 
then you have to go right back out and 

3328
02:31:55,781 --> 02:31:56,614
do it again.
In that process resulted in just a 

3329
02:31:59,230 --> 02:32:02,560
devastation on the wildlife in this 
country.

3330
02:32:03,050 --> 02:32:03,883
Yes.
And the same thing was happening with 

3331
02:32:05,650 --> 02:32:07,420
white tail deer,
elk,

3332
02:32:07,520 --> 02:32:09,320
black bears,
everything.

3333
02:32:09,410 --> 02:32:10,243
Nice.
And obviously,

3334
02:32:10,380 --> 02:32:10,890
obviously,

3335
02:32:10,890 --> 02:32:12,720
yeah,
that's the one that everybody harps on,

3336
02:32:12,721 --> 02:32:15,420
but they don't realize that it was 
pretty much everything

3337
02:32:15,510 --> 02:32:19,800
we could eat they shot and that's what 
we can put a price tag on it.

3338
02:32:19,801 --> 02:32:20,634
Right?
And that's one of the major issues that 

3339
02:32:22,470 --> 02:32:23,303
we're seeing in Idaho is they want to,
and with some of this auction tag stuff 

3340
02:32:27,691 --> 02:32:30,400
is we're starting to put a dollar amount
on our game.

3341
02:32:30,401 --> 02:32:31,234
And what do you mean by auction tax 
where we're pulling to eggs out of the 

3342
02:32:34,231 --> 02:32:36,240
general pool.
So like right now,

3343
02:32:36,330 --> 02:32:38,190
um,
let's say in the state,

3344
02:32:38,191 --> 02:32:40,010
Idaho,
um,

3345
02:32:40,890 --> 02:32:43,170
uh,
we could all put in,

3346
02:32:43,171 --> 02:32:45,410
you know,
a thousand people put in for a,

3347
02:32:45,480 --> 02:32:50,310
for elk tags in a prime unit,
the unit that grows the biggest balls,

3348
02:32:50,940 --> 02:32:54,150
well,
in order to raise more funds,

3349
02:32:54,570 --> 02:32:58,500
they started to remove one of those tags
and auction them off.

3350
02:32:59,010 --> 02:33:01,630
So that's putting a,
you know,

3351
02:33:01,710 --> 02:33:05,940
whatever we could all put in for $30 for
the remaining three elk.

3352
02:33:06,450 --> 02:33:07,283
But if we choose to,
we can all try to bid on each other for 

3353
02:33:09,721 --> 02:33:10,680
that fourth tag.

3354
02:33:10,830 --> 02:33:15,690
So if there is a limited amount of tags,
people have to realize that your chances

3355
02:33:15,691 --> 02:33:18,420
of drawing that tag are probably pretty 
slim,

3356
02:33:18,660 --> 02:33:19,493
unless you build up points every year,
you build up a certain amount of points 

3357
02:33:21,901 --> 02:33:24,300
in that makes it more likely that you're
going to draw a tag.

3358
02:33:24,301 --> 02:33:26,070
So people that don't understand the 
process,

3359
02:33:26,280 --> 02:33:29,040
so one person,
they'll take one tag and they put it off

3360
02:33:29,041 --> 02:33:31,890
and they'll allow it to be auctioned off
and sometimes they'll go for hundreds of

3361
02:33:31,891 --> 02:33:33,360
thousands of dollars,
right?

3362
02:33:33,720 --> 02:33:36,960
Like crazy rich dudes.
So there's two schools of thought.

3363
02:33:36,961 --> 02:33:39,480
One School of thought is look how much 
money he's going to conservation because

3364
02:33:39,481 --> 02:33:41,970
this one rich asshole that wants to 
spend $400,000

3365
02:33:41,971 --> 02:33:42,930
to kill a bighorn sheep.

3366
02:33:43,270 --> 02:33:44,103
Yes.
And I think saying it like you do the 

3367
02:33:46,001 --> 02:33:48,460
rich asshole thing.
That's how everybody says it,

3368
02:33:48,620 --> 02:33:49,453
right?
And of course I get really frustrated 

3369
02:33:50,711 --> 02:33:52,030
with that because I'm like,
well,

3370
02:33:52,390 --> 02:33:57,390
aren't we as the remaining sportsmen in 
this pool supporting the rich asshole by

3371
02:33:59,081 --> 02:33:59,914
giving him the ability?
Why don't the thousand people in the 

3372
02:34:02,831 --> 02:34:06,460
pool just agree to spend a couple extra 
bucks on the tag?

3373
02:34:06,970 --> 02:34:07,460
Well

3374
02:34:07,460 --> 02:34:08,293
that might help,
but is it really going to get you the 

3375
02:34:09,771 --> 02:34:12,050
hundreds of thousands of dollars?
So that one tag,

3376
02:34:12,680 --> 02:34:13,513
I mean,
it seems like without burdening the 

3377
02:34:15,321 --> 02:34:18,210
regular sportsmen who doesn't want spend
like didn't

3378
02:34:18,220 --> 02:34:20,650
Montana like significantly raised their 
tags,

3379
02:34:20,750 --> 02:34:23,080
the pricer tags recently?
There was a lot of complaints.

3380
02:34:23,270 --> 02:34:24,400
Yeah,
they're a.

3381
02:34:24,640 --> 02:34:27,540
But they put a lot of burden on the out 
of state hunter,

3382
02:34:27,560 --> 02:34:28,770
not the instate.
Right,

3383
02:34:28,890 --> 02:34:29,510
right.
Yeah.

3384
02:34:29,510 --> 02:34:31,780
The resident hunter gets a break,
right?

3385
02:34:31,781 --> 02:34:34,200
They get our instate.
Um,

3386
02:34:34,690 --> 02:34:35,081
you know,
I,

3387
02:34:35,081 --> 02:34:35,914
I'm,
I supported a tag fee increase for 

3388
02:34:39,101 --> 02:34:41,560
resident hunters because we haven't had 
one in a lot of years.

3389
02:34:41,920 --> 02:34:45,460
So what's a tag like an over the counter
tag for elk right now in Montana,

3390
02:34:45,910 --> 02:34:46,810
or excuse me,
in Idaho,

3391
02:34:47,740 --> 02:34:49,750
I want to save 40 bucks.
Thirty five bucks.

3392
02:34:49,751 --> 02:34:50,940
That's amazing.
Yeah,

3393
02:34:50,950 --> 02:34:53,440
and I want to say Montana 17 as a 
resident,

3394
02:34:53,441 --> 02:34:54,274
she knew how amazing it is there.
For 17 bucks you can get 500 pounds of 

3395
02:34:58,601 --> 02:35:02,440
meat and most honestly your effort to.
Most hunters,

3396
02:35:02,441 --> 02:35:06,340
I mean speaking for the guys that I hang
around with and nobody else.

3397
02:35:06,880 --> 02:35:09,040
We like to drink our beer.
What?

3398
02:35:09,370 --> 02:35:10,250
Yes.
Well,

3399
02:35:10,270 --> 02:35:11,103
and spending $17 on a case of beer that 
has gone all generously say a couple of 

3400
02:35:17,111 --> 02:35:19,330
weeks.
Right.

3401
02:35:19,390 --> 02:35:22,180
I love,
I love to hunt elk and deer.

3402
02:35:22,390 --> 02:35:23,680
Absolutely love it.
It is.

3403
02:35:24,400 --> 02:35:28,750
I mean it's just something that I look 
forward to the year long,

3404
02:35:28,970 --> 02:35:29,803
right.
I can bury more than willing to spend 

3405
02:35:35,051 --> 02:35:38,980
more than 17 bucks on,
on the potential.

3406
02:35:39,250 --> 02:35:42,580
The thrill of the excuse to go hunt for 
sure.

3407
02:35:42,640 --> 02:35:43,473
Yeah.
I think that's reasonable and that will 

3408
02:35:44,530 --> 02:35:45,363
pretty much within anybody's budget.
I mean just raise it to 20 bucks and 

3409
02:35:48,131 --> 02:35:48,964
then all that money is going to go back 
to the state and it's going to help and 

3410
02:35:52,031 --> 02:35:53,470
it's still very,
very,

3411
02:35:53,471 --> 02:35:56,190
very reasonable.
Collectively say,

3412
02:35:56,200 --> 02:35:57,033
I mean it reasonably don't know the 
exact price generally because you can 

3413
02:35:59,141 --> 02:36:01,950
buy a sportsman's package.
So I think it's 100 and I don't know,

3414
02:36:01,960 --> 02:36:02,770
$5.

3415
02:36:02,770 --> 02:36:03,603
You can hunt and fish,
like basically anything that's not a 

3416
02:36:07,571 --> 02:36:08,404
draw everything over the counter as long
as you don't go over the limit of what 

3417
02:36:10,691 --> 02:36:11,890
you could get.
Pretty much,

3418
02:36:11,891 --> 02:36:13,140
I mean pretty amazing.
Yeah.

3419
02:36:13,150 --> 02:36:14,890
And Idaho's a true lottery.
Right?

3420
02:36:14,980 --> 02:36:17,610
So there are no points.
Oh,

3421
02:36:17,611 --> 02:36:19,240
it's one of those dates.
That's interesting.

3422
02:36:19,280 --> 02:36:20,113
Yeah.
And I truly like because it spreads out 

3423
02:36:22,420 --> 02:36:26,350
the pressure.
So our draw odds are fantastic.

3424
02:36:26,590 --> 02:36:29,560
So now we're where someone wants to 
auction those things off,

3425
02:36:29,590 --> 02:36:30,423
like what is a,
like one of those crazy elk tag because 

3426
02:36:32,141 --> 02:36:34,090
I know that wild sheep is the big one,
right?

3427
02:36:34,091 --> 02:36:36,640
Like bighorn sheep are the ones that 
people spend it for three.

3428
02:36:36,641 --> 02:36:37,720
Oh five.
Is that what it was?

3429
02:36:37,750 --> 02:36:42,580
Three hundred and $5,000.
And at the same an elk tag a sheep while

3430
02:36:42,640 --> 02:36:43,660
for shakes,
Syria that,

3431
02:36:43,820 --> 02:36:44,653
um,
that we hunted that I think last year 

3432
02:36:46,781 --> 02:36:50,290
went for over half a million,
but you've got to keep in sheep.

3433
02:36:51,160 --> 02:36:51,993
Sheep are the rarest thing that we have,
like they're doing really well in the 

3434
02:36:57,250 --> 02:37:01,060
areas that they're doing well in.
But then the brakes,

3435
02:37:01,061 --> 02:37:03,580
we saw a ton of them.
It's crazy everywhere,

3436
02:37:03,640 --> 02:37:04,590
but disease,
you know,

3437
02:37:04,680 --> 02:37:07,880
they're super susceptible to disease,
domestic sheep diseases.

3438
02:37:07,960 --> 02:37:10,390
Correct.
Because there was a sitcom of video,

3439
02:37:10,391 --> 02:37:11,650
uh,
that they did.

3440
02:37:11,680 --> 02:37:14,880
They did those short film about the,
uh,

3441
02:37:15,470 --> 02:37:16,303
door

3442
02:37:16,350 --> 02:37:18,110
I heard is,
how do you say it?

3443
02:37:18,170 --> 02:37:20,370
T e n d e r o y,
yeah,

3444
02:37:20,410 --> 02:37:21,243
tenderloin.
And these sheep are suffering from 

3445
02:37:24,501 --> 02:37:26,690
diseases that are coming from domestic 
sheep.

3446
02:37:26,691 --> 02:37:27,524
So they're trying to figure out a way to
breed a domestic sheep that doesn't 

3447
02:37:31,551 --> 02:37:32,384
catch this disease so that they can 
reintroduce healthy sheep into these 

3448
02:37:36,261 --> 02:37:41,210
areas and not have them be infected by 
these different diseases.

3449
02:37:41,211 --> 02:37:43,160
They get some really fascinating stuff.

3450
02:37:43,180 --> 02:37:45,850
Do you remember a kit?
Fischer was on that hunt with us,

3451
02:37:45,910 --> 02:37:47,140
um,
in the breaks,

3452
02:37:47,141 --> 02:37:48,310
he was Rowan,
one of the boats,

3453
02:37:48,670 --> 02:37:49,503
um,
he works for National Wildlife 

3454
02:37:51,310 --> 02:37:55,450
Federation and that's when he does is he
does conflict mitigation basically.

3455
02:37:55,451 --> 02:37:56,284
So he identifies those,
a grazing allotments and most women are 

3456
02:38:00,640 --> 02:38:02,740
on public land.
Um,

3457
02:38:03,370 --> 02:38:04,203
and he identifies the conflict or 
grazing allotments mostly for bighorn 

3458
02:38:08,980 --> 02:38:09,813
sheep that could put domestic sheep that
could potentially be carrying diseases 

3459
02:38:14,380 --> 02:38:18,490
in contact with these wild cheaper.
And so he's looking to,

3460
02:38:18,760 --> 02:38:19,593
you know,
typically pay the rancher that has that 

3461
02:38:21,701 --> 02:38:26,701
grazing allotment fair market value for 
that grazing allotment and he just turns

3462
02:38:28,181 --> 02:38:31,540
it back over to uh,
the US forest service.

3463
02:38:31,640 --> 02:38:33,890
And that's a real issue with buffalo,
right,

3464
02:38:33,891 --> 02:38:34,724
with wild bison because there's two 
schools of thought and there's one 

3465
02:38:37,941 --> 02:38:38,774
school,
it's about Brucellosis and that 

3466
02:38:40,101 --> 02:38:44,450
brucellosis will somehow or another be 
transmitted from the bison to cattle.

3467
02:38:44,880 --> 02:38:45,713
Um,
but apparently a lot of people say that 

3468
02:38:48,741 --> 02:38:49,574
that's kind of a bullshit argument 
because it's really about the bison 

3469
02:38:52,160 --> 02:38:55,760
eating up all the grazing land and 
forcing out the domestic cattle.

3470
02:38:55,850 --> 02:38:56,683
So they using the brucellosis as an 
excuse to say that this is the reason 

3471
02:39:00,951 --> 02:39:03,110
why we need to kill off the bias and get
them out of the way.

3472
02:39:03,200 --> 02:39:05,360
I think there's some legitimate little 
bit of on both sides.

3473
02:39:05,500 --> 02:39:06,171
Yeah.
And,

3474
02:39:06,171 --> 02:39:10,780
and the difference between the sheep and
the sheep don't carry a disease.

3475
02:39:11,080 --> 02:39:13,230
Bison definitely do carry,
uh,

3476
02:39:13,260 --> 02:39:15,820
the brucellosis.
But domestic sheep do carry.

3477
02:39:15,821 --> 02:39:18,130
Some domestic sheep do.
But the wild ones,

3478
02:39:18,160 --> 02:39:18,993
the wild wild ones don't.
But they can catch domestic sheep and 

3479
02:39:21,790 --> 02:39:24,590
they have no,
they can't find the immune systems.

3480
02:39:24,880 --> 02:39:26,440
So.
But yeah,

3481
02:39:26,441 --> 02:39:29,030
the Bison one is,
you know,

3482
02:39:29,440 --> 02:39:30,273
I got a big eastern Montana family.
It takes a lot of ground to grow beef 

3483
02:39:34,001 --> 02:39:35,830
out there.
And if that's your livelihood,

3484
02:39:35,860 --> 02:39:36,970
absolutely,
you know,

3485
02:39:37,270 --> 02:39:38,103
putting more animals on the countryside 
and some fucking hulk bison thing way 

3486
02:39:43,361 --> 02:39:44,194
bigger than a cat man.
It's going to directly impact your 

3487
02:39:47,081 --> 02:39:47,914
livelihood.
But I think just as we were talking 

3488
02:39:49,301 --> 02:39:50,820
about earlier,
man,

3489
02:39:50,830 --> 02:39:54,220
there's some,
there's some happy medium there and if,

3490
02:39:54,340 --> 02:39:56,680
especially if we're looking at,
you know,

3491
02:39:56,830 --> 02:39:57,663
um,
some of this oil and gas stuff that's 

3492
02:39:58,751 --> 02:39:59,584
getting scary right now,
like especially with like all of a 

3493
02:40:03,191 --> 02:40:06,130
sudden we're saying that you don't have 
to clean up after yourself after he had,

3494
02:40:06,660 --> 02:40:09,190
you know,
started a big mind somewhere,

3495
02:40:09,370 --> 02:40:10,203
right?
Like I would much rather have bison out 

3496
02:40:13,200 --> 02:40:13,980
than

3497
02:40:13,980 --> 02:40:14,813
like let's raise funds through sports 
minor recreational than digging a big 

3498
02:40:19,291 --> 02:40:23,070
pit in a beautiful spot.
So I don't know if that's going to cover

3499
02:40:23,071 --> 02:40:23,904
it though to play with the Dakota 
pipeline liquid they're talking about 

3500
02:40:26,221 --> 02:40:27,054
there.
It's just like the amount of money 

3501
02:40:28,231 --> 02:40:30,810
that's going to come from that is just 
staggering.

3502
02:40:31,200 --> 02:40:32,033
And so the amount of pressure that's 
involved in making something like that 

3503
02:40:34,231 --> 02:40:37,710
go through is also pretty staggering.
It is,

3504
02:40:39,060 --> 02:40:40,980
but it's dangerous,
you know,

3505
02:40:40,981 --> 02:40:41,814
and what the disaster that could take 
place is you can't put a price on it 

3506
02:40:46,530 --> 02:40:47,260
because what,
what,

3507
02:40:47,260 --> 02:40:49,440
what could be done if they ruin a river 
system,

3508
02:40:49,890 --> 02:40:54,690
if somehow or another this gas line 
breaks and you have oil flooding a river

3509
02:40:54,691 --> 02:40:59,640
system the same way they had that bp oil
rig disaster out in the Gulf.

3510
02:41:00,060 --> 02:41:01,810
God,
could you imagine that?

3511
02:41:01,820 --> 02:41:02,970
Still dealing with them,
right?

3512
02:41:03,030 --> 02:41:03,360
Yeah.

3513
02:41:03,360 --> 02:41:04,590
Fuck yeah.
Fuck yeah.

3514
02:41:04,591 --> 02:41:06,000
And how about the people that had to 
deal with it?

3515
02:41:06,001 --> 02:41:08,220
There were living near there that were 
sick,

3516
02:41:08,700 --> 02:41:09,533
you know,
there's all sorts of diseases and 

3517
02:41:10,291 --> 02:41:13,680
there's all sorts of lawsuits going on 
and all the cleanup crews.

3518
02:41:13,681 --> 02:41:14,514
I mean they had,
they made prisoners clean up the 

3519
02:41:16,021 --> 02:41:16,854
fucking,
the BP mass and there's a lot of weird 

3520
02:41:18,571 --> 02:41:20,100
shit involved in that,
right?

3521
02:41:20,360 --> 02:41:21,150
It,
uh,

3522
02:41:21,150 --> 02:41:24,660
I'm truly not educated on the economics 
of it and my,

3523
02:41:24,661 --> 02:41:26,970
you know,
my brain says that no,

3524
02:41:26,980 --> 02:41:27,810
there's,
you know,

3525
02:41:27,810 --> 02:41:31,060
we couldn't,
there was no warm fuzzy eco,

3526
02:41:32,060 --> 02:41:32,893
you know,
lodge that we could set up that would 

3527
02:41:34,440 --> 02:41:36,010
match the funds from,
you know,

3528
02:41:36,300 --> 02:41:37,540
oil and gas.
But yeah,

3529
02:41:37,860 --> 02:41:38,400
man,
yeah,

3530
02:41:38,400 --> 02:41:42,330
I'm just trying to think longterm and 
boy,

3531
02:41:43,020 --> 02:41:47,780
it just wrecked that landscape and the 
landscape is what I've been in love with

3532
02:41:47,790 --> 02:41:49,500
since a little kid.
So yeah,

3533
02:41:49,590 --> 02:41:51,960
you know,
then nobody wants to be able to let your

3534
02:41:51,961 --> 02:41:53,320
toilet water on fire either.

3535
02:41:54,010 --> 02:41:54,843
You ever see those fucking gasland 
documentary is coming right out of the 

3536
02:41:57,451 --> 02:41:58,284
tap and they guys sticks a lighter to it
and was fucking water's on fire and 

3537
02:42:01,381 --> 02:42:03,110
people are both labeled supplementing 
what we'll do.

3538
02:42:03,540 --> 02:42:06,000
That's always been the case.
Not with these fucking people,

3539
02:42:06,380 --> 02:42:08,430
but these fucking people is directly 
related to fracking.

3540
02:42:08,431 --> 02:42:10,170
Like just all these apologists for that 
stuff.

3541
02:42:10,200 --> 02:42:11,033
It's like how many fucking earthquakes 
needed to have an Oklahoma before you 

3542
02:42:14,161 --> 02:42:14,791
go,
hey,

3543
02:42:14,791 --> 02:42:16,800
um,
is this okay?

3544
02:42:16,801 --> 02:42:17,634
Like,
what do he doesn't have a thousand 

3545
02:42:18,451 --> 02:42:19,830
earthquakes a year now?
Is that cool?

3546
02:42:19,860 --> 02:42:20,401
Like,
yeah,

3547
02:42:20,401 --> 02:42:24,990
as long as it's under a thousand,
we're looking at as long as we only like

3548
02:42:25,010 --> 02:42:28,710
pollute like three or four wells a year.
It's like survivors.

3549
02:42:28,800 --> 02:42:31,770
It's fine.
We got plenty of bottled water,

3550
02:42:32,070 --> 02:42:32,903
but it's constantly evolving thing.
Technology all across the board is 

3551
02:42:38,311 --> 02:42:39,390
getting way,
way,

3552
02:42:39,391 --> 02:42:40,180
way better.

3553
02:42:40,180 --> 02:42:43,230
We know way more about these migration 
routes and we used to,

3554
02:42:43,500 --> 02:42:48,500
we know way intact migration routes are 
what we need for healthy mule deer.

3555
02:42:50,040 --> 02:42:51,430
Elk.
Um,

3556
02:42:51,750 --> 02:42:53,400
yeah.
That's like a recent thing they realized

3557
02:42:53,401 --> 02:42:55,110
how far mule deer travel,
right?

3558
02:42:55,111 --> 02:42:57,540
It kind of blew these biologists.
So wind blowing.

3559
02:42:57,541 --> 02:42:58,770
Yeah.
Hundreds of miles.

3560
02:42:58,910 --> 02:43:01,560
We have a deer in our unit that migrate 
170 miles.

3561
02:43:01,800 --> 02:43:03,310
Whoa.
Yeah.

3562
02:43:04,320 --> 02:43:05,420
Wow.
They have to.

3563
02:43:05,430 --> 02:43:07,050
I mean like years like this,
we've got,

3564
02:43:07,200 --> 02:43:08,310
you know,
right now we've got,

3565
02:43:08,340 --> 02:43:09,510
I don't know,
six,

3566
02:43:09,511 --> 02:43:11,200
seven,
eight feet of snow on the ground.

3567
02:43:11,201 --> 02:43:11,980
Right.
If they don't

3568
02:43:11,980 --> 02:43:13,750
travel,
it's their curtains.

3569
02:43:14,380 --> 02:43:17,740
But when you come here and you see no 
snow but so many people,

3570
02:43:18,250 --> 02:43:22,360
what's better regarding,
I don't know what's better.

3571
02:43:22,361 --> 02:43:27,361
No snow and a massive swarm of humans or
eight feet of snow.

3572
02:43:29,170 --> 02:43:30,850
Not that many humans.
What do you guys,

3573
02:43:30,910 --> 02:43:33,380
because you guys stay where you're at 
and I stay where I'm at,

3574
02:43:35,570 --> 02:43:36,403
like a trick question because I always 
want to talk to people that come from a 

3575
02:43:39,941 --> 02:43:40,774
place like catch them and you come to 
Los Angeles and see the fucking swarmed 

3576
02:43:45,841 --> 02:43:49,090
the high,
the get on that four or five and go,

3577
02:43:49,091 --> 02:43:50,980
what in the fuck is this thing?
Dude,

3578
02:43:50,981 --> 02:43:51,960
I,
I'm not gonna.

3579
02:43:52,160 --> 02:43:55,360
When we hopped on the bus,
just go get a rental car.

3580
02:43:55,361 --> 02:44:00,361
Last night I was gripped.
It felt like I was at a Nascar race car.

3581
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:05,370
Oh yeah.
They're aggressive.

3582
02:44:06,820 --> 02:44:08,020
You have to be.
Yeah.

3583
02:44:08,021 --> 02:44:11,380
They did a study that showed there's a 
direct correlation between the amount of

3584
02:44:11,381 --> 02:44:12,214
footsteps people take per minute and the
population that they're in and also the 

3585
02:44:17,590 --> 02:44:19,750
faster they talk they.

3586
02:44:19,750 --> 02:44:23,470
If the population is higher,
they will say their syllables faster.

3587
02:44:23,740 --> 02:44:26,740
That will say words faster.
They'll say more words in a minute.

3588
02:44:26,920 --> 02:44:27,753
Well,
I was a direct correlation from New 

3589
02:44:29,170 --> 02:44:30,340
York.
Definitely talk faster.

3590
02:44:30,370 --> 02:44:31,390
Oh yeah.
Oh,

3591
02:44:31,391 --> 02:44:32,220
for sure.
Yeah,

3592
02:44:32,220 --> 02:44:36,040
but it's fascinating.
They walk faster to here it goes.

3593
02:44:36,370 --> 02:44:37,300
Senator,
what is this?

3594
02:44:37,301 --> 02:44:39,550
Amy?
Clears way for finishing Dakota.

3595
02:44:39,610 --> 02:44:40,443
Oh army.
I'll work amy finishing Dakota access 

3596
02:44:43,841 --> 02:44:47,050
oil pipeline by granting easement 
opponents likely to appeal.

3597
02:44:47,580 --> 02:44:48,750
Oh,
just now.

3598
02:44:50,750 --> 02:44:52,240
Um,
but yeah,

3599
02:44:52,540 --> 02:44:53,500
you know,
where,

3600
02:44:53,560 --> 02:44:55,750
where you guys live.
It's just a completely different kind of

3601
02:44:55,751 --> 02:44:58,300
place.
Look at the first quote.

3602
02:44:58,570 --> 02:45:00,460
Go back to that.
Go back to that.

3603
02:45:00,640 --> 02:45:02,470
You should mention that Obama were 
approved.

3604
02:45:02,471 --> 02:45:03,730
This project,
the pros play.

3605
02:45:03,731 --> 02:45:05,860
So the loop towards.
Can't blame trump.

3606
02:45:07,330 --> 02:45:12,330
Fuck face lip tards.
Oh that is one of the best words.

3607
02:45:13,361 --> 02:45:15,850
It's come out of this whole fucking 
right versus left.

3608
02:45:16,030 --> 02:45:16,863
Oh Man.
I mean,

3609
02:45:17,080 --> 02:45:19,030
like I said,
I'm just speaking off the cuff.

3610
02:45:19,060 --> 02:45:20,130
They're like,
you know,

3611
02:45:20,140 --> 02:45:22,210
I love,
I'm an outside guy.

3612
02:45:22,420 --> 02:45:23,253
I don't want that stuff to ever change.
But I realized there's got to be 

3613
02:45:27,730 --> 02:45:31,000
something for everybody to.
I mean we're a big country.

3614
02:45:31,001 --> 02:45:34,660
It's more than just me and like super 
out of the way place.

3615
02:45:34,950 --> 02:45:36,970
So I don't ever want to live in New York
City,

3616
02:45:37,180 --> 02:45:41,540
but I know a lot of people will fuck in.
Love it and good God.

3617
02:45:41,760 --> 02:45:42,820
Yeah.
Good luck with it.

3618
02:45:43,240 --> 02:45:44,073
But it's interesting when I see guys 
like you that come from Idaho and then 

3619
02:45:47,141 --> 02:45:50,230
come down here to Los Angeles and I see,
look in your face,

3620
02:45:50,231 --> 02:45:51,550
you're like,
fuck this place.

3621
02:45:51,900 --> 02:45:54,310
You can't wait to get out of here.
I live here.

3622
02:45:54,580 --> 02:45:56,800
I'm raising a family.
Here is where I do my work.

3623
02:45:57,140 --> 02:45:59,170
And you guys are like,
fuck this place.

3624
02:45:59,980 --> 02:46:02,260
It's just interesting.
It's like the driving.

3625
02:46:02,800 --> 02:46:03,640
I don't know.
Cow.

3626
02:46:03,650 --> 02:46:06,220
I like ran a stoplight already.
I like,

3627
02:46:06,221 --> 02:46:09,590
I don't know if it gets to you too lazy.

3628
02:46:10,850 --> 02:46:15,850
It's crazy feel.
That means to the next guy.

3629
02:46:17,421 --> 02:46:19,460
It's like when you put your blinker on 
to change lanes,

3630
02:46:19,461 --> 02:46:21,680
that means here.
It means they close that space.

3631
02:46:21,681 --> 02:46:22,514
You don't want that fucker in.
It's going to slow me down by one 10th 

3632
02:46:25,281 --> 02:46:26,390
of a second.
All adds up,

3633
02:46:26,420 --> 02:46:28,640
combat it.
It all adds up.

3634
02:46:28,700 --> 02:46:30,560
It's very intense.
It's very intense.

3635
02:46:31,930 --> 02:46:32,763
Gentlemen,
just been a fun conversation and I hope 

3636
02:46:34,941 --> 02:46:35,774
we illuminated a lot of these issues 
with people and fuck her six slash 22 

3637
02:46:40,580 --> 02:46:42,500
years.
Any bills like it.

3638
02:46:42,501 --> 02:46:44,210
And we need to do the same thing.
We did two,

3639
02:46:44,211 --> 02:46:44,961
six,
21.

3640
02:46:44,961 --> 02:46:48,080
We need to do that to 6:22
and contact that guy and start the whole

3641
02:46:48,081 --> 02:46:48,914
campaign all over again because you just
can't remove the resources that are 

3642
02:46:52,251 --> 02:46:53,960
going to protect those,
those lands.

3643
02:46:53,990 --> 02:46:55,460
They're going to keep coming.
Very important.

3644
02:46:55,670 --> 02:46:59,090
So thank you guys for what you do.
